<p>須就五年來中日間兩大事變中有田所佔之地位。一爲回憶。不難澈底明瞭之。民十七濟南五三事變發生時。有田以駐德大使館參事。爲田中兼外相召回。任亞細亞局長。策劃對華侵略之步驟。民二十瀋陽九一八事變發生數月後。芳澤謙吉爲外相。其時有田方使奥。復被召回任外次。主持所謂强硬外交。此兩事件。爲日本對華之最强横舉動。而日外務省。先後自國外召回有田。使負重責。則即謂有田爲日本外交官中對華侵略之專家。亦無不可。昨日有田使華消息傳出後。京電所示。大有談虎色變之概。日外務省之準備如此人物。來任駐華公使。用意如何。姑不必問。惟如使此消息而有若干可信也。則中國政府不容猶疑。應速起而爲反對之活動。十九年冬間小幡酉吉之（埃格萊曼）問題。前事不遠。依樣葫蘆。重畫一次。此其時矣。</p>
<p>廣田於未任日外相時。曾準備來華一行。斡旋中日闗係。今其就任後對華</p>
<p>第一次外交行動。即以最不適宜之人。來膺使節。事屬矛盾。未易置信。且有田</p>
<p>八郎在日本之所謂霞闗人物中。並非上。選去年六。月曾以與英使談話失詞。爲日本報紙譏爲（没常識。）今復爲内田免職。亦非無故。廣田外相即欲更易駐華公使。亦不必任用此人。雖然。日本政治。兩年來受軍人之操縱。矛盾百出。離奇可駭。其所作爲。實難以常理推測。此次有田使華之消息。對於我國之圖敷衍局面。不欲以堅强態度對付日本者。已不啻給以當頭一棒。此一棒之擊。倘能激動反感。引起作堅决表示之準備。則正國人所期望者也。</p>
<p>日來東京電訊。闗於日本外交官更換之傳述。内容複雜。而其實際頗多與派系有闗。加以分析。亦爲切要。適本報月刋第九號日本通訊。載有日本外交官派系一表。特參酌附錄於次。以助讀者對於最近日本外交之瞭解。</p>

<h3>撞沉圖南輪進行公斷</h3>
<p>理事會已呈請交部組公斷庭秉公仲裁</p>
<p>招商局圖南輪、被長春丸撞沉後、日人置不理　、而大連方面之海事法庭、且有宣判圖南輪沉失其咎不在日輪云云、招商局以此案久延不决、日人抱不理主義、則局方損失巨大、茲經磋商結果、决議呈請交部、將圖南案提交公斷、以明責任而謀解决、其請求公斷之呈文、業經理事會呈請交部矣、茲將該案情形、分述如下、</p>
<h3>日方片面判斷</h3>
<p>大連海事法庭現已宣布、謂長春丸與圖南輪撞碰案、　　審訊結果、其咎不在日輪云云、此項判詞已通告大連汽社、但該海事庭根據片面之聲請、而便貿然宣判、在事實上殊屬不合法理、當然不生效力、</p>
<h3>迭次交涉無效</h3>
<p>招商局在圖南沉失以後、卽調查此案之眞相、經詳细查究、知肇禍之貴純在日輪長春丸之過失且　取得確切證據、當由該局根據理由事實、函致大連汽社、切實交涉、但數次去函、而日人乃置之不答、現在長春丸撞破之船頭部、目已修理竣事、更名青島丸、照常來滬行駛大連青島及上海之間、而近更藉詞大連海事局之片面判斷、置撞沉圖南之死亡員客沉失輪貨等重大責任於不顧、</p>
<h3>呈請舉行公斷</h3>
<p>總經理劉鴻生、已將此案之經過呈報理事會要求將此案提請公斷、當由理事會通過、卽具呈交部、略稱、圖南輪在山東成山角被長春丸撞沉一案、經本局切實調查、肇禍之責、應歸日輪、惟該汽船會社對於本局迭次交涉、置之不理若向法庭提出控訴、不特有領判權之　係、而　於上次日郵社龍野丸撞沉新康輪案之置不理會、使法律亦難於處置、如向日本法庭起訴、更覺形隔勢禁、難得良好效果、惟有　行公　、聘請公正人員、秉公仲裁、俾肇禍者負全部責任、庶損失得令賠償、該項量文、已經送部、俟批復卽可進行、</p>
<h3>擬在上海進行</h3>
<p>闗於公公斷進行、經記者向謙局探詢、大致在上海組織　　公斷委員會、其委員則由招商·大汽·互聘航海專家公正人若干名、組成公斷庭、惟中日雙方、均不得加人委員、以昭大公、由公斷庭傳集兩造之船主船員、秉公訊問、以斷定此案之責任之所在、局方俟部批到來、便函請大連汽社卽會同商聘專家並恊議公斷委員之名額、然後將全案移付公斷庭仲裁之、</p>

<h3>孔乙己及其環境</h3>
<p>— 烏尤</p>
<p>（呐喊）中的（阿Ｑ），有的說是巳經死去，有的說是仍然在人間，議論紛紛，早爲一般人的口頭禪，連以（專造謡言攻擊魯迅）爲職業的什麽，他常把（阿Ｑ）用作譏駡人的故典。因爲（阿Ｑ），正如這作者在（我怎麽做起小說來？）上所說，（嘴在浙江，臉在北京，衣服在山西，）由許多中國人的壞脾氣（拼凑起來），原是富有普徧性的。</p>
<p>同在（呐喊）中，還有着個和（阿Ｑ）相像的人物，這就是（孔乙己）。（孔乙己）的特色，第一是滿口（之乎者也），連對於小孩子說話，也是（多乎哉？不多也！）其次是要虚張面子，明明只好同短衣帮一道站着喝酒，却不肯脫掉又髒又破，好像已經十多年没有洗，十多年没有補了的長衫。第三，他辯論不過强有力的同道喝酒的人和掌櫃，就到幼弱無能爲的學徒身上去出氣，而且稱能；這同（阿Ｑ）的精神勝利法，被人打了以後，還以爲兒子打爹，實在相差無幾。（好吃懶做）的（孔乙己），给人家鈔書，會得連筆墨紙硯一起偷着走，對於酒店裹的信用却特别好：僅僅一文錢的茴香豆的下酒物，却要分給小孩子一人一顆；雖然處處受人奚落，對於酒店裹的學徒，却自負着敎導的責任；聽人說他偷竊，就會紅起臉孔，還要綻出青筋來爭論幾句，眞是使人覺得又可氣，又可笑的了。</p>
<p>可是（孔乙己）的環境，更使人哭笑不得。同道喝酒的短衣帮和掌櫃，都要就（孔乙己）的身上取樂。他们要說穿他的隠情；使他難堪得紅起臉孔來了，他们就得意，哈哈的大笑。</p>
<p>以别人的難堪爲快樂，這可以說是（反同情）罷！（孔乙己）的環境的（魯鎭）人，就是富於這種（反同情）的。先給（孔乙己）以難堪，再從他的難堪中謀取快樂，（魯鎭）人是這樣生活着的。</p>
<p>（孔乙己）及其環境，巳經過去了呢，還是依然存在？</p>
<h3>闗於頭髮</h3>
<p>— 馬國亮</p>
<p>從兩三年前起，我便發覺頭頂上的髮漸漸地稀疏了。每天早上梳髮的時候，梳齒裹總夾着長長短短的頭髮，洗頭落下來的數量更使自己吃驚。一直到現在，本來有厚厚的一把髮的，祗賸了薄薄的一層，僅能把頭皮全蓋着罷了。粗看起來還一點不覺得稀疏，但試小心的注意地一看，你便會覺得那黑髮就如一張透明的紙，把頭皮全顯了出來。拿（外强中乾）這句話來形容我的頭髮是最切當不過的。</p>
<p>頭髮的變白和脫落，原本是頽老的象徵。但是我不能承認的，我自己的確還在年青。我愛惜我的頭髮，如同愛惜我的年青時日一樣。雖不至完全爲了美觀上的原因，但總覺得，像辛克萊說過的一樣，（還不到三十歳的年紀便秃了頭，是有點、氣的。）</p>
<p>所以，爲了防止頭髮的脫落，我確曾用了不少的方法。由依照理髮匠敎我用白蘭地酒擦頭皮的方法做起，一直到試用了市上藥房發售的各式各種中西的生毛藥止，結果依然是失敗了。雖然每種藥的仿單上都發誓般的寫着牠是（其效如神）。神旣不助我，還有什麽辦法呢！從人體美方面來說，頭髮是不可缺少的。至少在現社會，一個女人的頭髮存在與否，如同她的一雙眼睛存在與否一樣，直接會影響到她一生的幸福的。幸而我是男子，况且在保護上也早有人發明了帽子那件東西，那末即使牠連最後的一根都脫掉了也無闗重要的。我祗怕牠的脫落是毫無價值可言。</p>
<p>據說：普通最易脫髮的有兩種人，一種是軍人，因爲過多的汗液會把髮根摧殘的。另一種是政治家，科學家，文人……等，即是那些過度用腦者。除去軍人不能和我自己併爲一談之外（因爲我連吃力的兵式體操也没試過，）别人脫下來的頭髮的確是每一根都有牠脫落的原因和價值的。而我自己却没來由地也脫起來，倒像有點太不自量了。愛因斯坦給人類　獻了偉大的思想學術，到現在活到七十歳還有一把厚厚的頭髮；自己不過還是二十多歳，對人類没有貢戲，没有建樹，頭髮却脫落了許多，說起來不該羞死？</p>
<p>自己不是思想家，而頭髮竟擅自脫落像許多的思想家一樣，其情形彷彿現在大家詛咒着的不懂政治而妄談政治，不解歷史的現實而妄談建國計劃一般，同樣是不可原諒的。我時時希望有一種藥，或者如在夢中得仙人賜下靈丹，使我將來不至秃頭而安份地有一個平常人的模樣。否則旣不學無術，而又硬充成思想家的樣子，萬一别人誤會，眞以爲我是思想家，誤信了我的話而轉入歧途，這罪過我實在擔當不起，倒不如靜悄悄地回復到無知者的羣裹，讓眞正有思想學問的賢者去播說他的眞理，而不至給我淆亂了人们的觀聽，則自己雖無貢獻，但幸没有從中破壞，自己便很心滿意足了。</p>
<p>但是眞能醫治脫髮的藥，什麽地方才可尋到呢？</p>
<h3>老彭詠言</h3>
<p>許久不接老彭的信了，有點奇怪！</p>
<p>剛從醫院回來，桌上擺着Ｗ君的來信：（老彭胃病大發，進了醫院，胸膛割了一個口，左肋下挖了一個洞。經過還好。）我全身像通過了一道電流。</p>
<p>十二點還差五分，郵差送來了小陳一封信：（我去看了老彭，醫生說要兩星期後才能斷定，……）眼前突然現出了一團黑影，而且慢慢地在長大。</p>
<p>Ｓ君的一封信終於證實了我所懷着的恐怖：（老彭死了！我去看時，他還睡在醫院冰室裹……）</p>
<p>永不能有老彭的來信了！</p>
<p>乂乂乂乂</p>
<p>老彭喜歡足球，在第一師範的球場裹，我和他爭逐了幾年，却不曾對面談過話。十三年在北平見面，也不過照例應酬幾句。十九年我漂流到了上海，爲着肚皮裹閙恐慌，在商務印書館的編輯所裹又找着了他。那時他巳走上了中國的文壇，（彭家煌）三字在作者的行列裹佔了個小小的地位。似乎他對於在漂泊中的我，表示了熱烈的同情，於是我们才在友誼上推進了一步。時代的狂風，煽起了太平洋西岸不少青年的熱血；老彭的作品也跟着時代起了變化。勞苦大衆的呼聲，時代青年的苦悶，也可以在他那犀利的筆尖和那　子滿腮的黑　上浮着的微笑裹找得出來。</p>
<p>乂乂乂乂</p>
<p>印象最深的要算是在乂乂的一幕：</p>
<p>（老彭也來了！）一天Ｌ君在窗下呌，臉上浮着苦笑。</p>
<p>（啊！）我這麽回答了一聲。</p>
<p>調號了丁。我匆忙地捲起舖蓋，跟着所丁跑到了另一間房裹，第一個歡迎我的便是他：</p>
<p>（不想我们在這裹又會着了！）他打了一個大哈哈。</p>
<p>他那時很快樂，除了担心他的脚爛了之外，甚麽都不掛心。平時只是鬧東西吃，和同房人開玩笑，有時也下下棋。靜的時候盤坐在床上和我们一塊閑談。（這小是生活，太平凡……）他老是燃着希望的火炬。</p>
<p>他的意志，和他的鬍子一樣，無論剃刀怎樣犀利，今天剃光了，明天又長了出來，而且比前一次更多更硬。</p>
<p>他那時許久不剃鬍子了，眞的像個鍾馗樣的。</p>
<p>（空隙裹來的風），到底不能飛沙揚波，所以他又從地獄走到了人間。可是他的胃病便從此一天一天地厲害了。</p>
<p>乂乂乂乂</p>
<p>現在他已安眠在黄浦江邊。外國人的砲彈的遺跡上，躺着他那副飽受苦難的軀殼。如果眞的靈魂不滅，也許他還能看到太平洋上的狂潮的到來。</p>
<h3>盧那卡爾斯基的話</h3>
<p>徐懋庸（西歐的積極底的人们，一遇一切苦痛，不快，不幸，即力究其因，並且竭力想將這用决定底的手段來療治丨丨東洋的被動底的人们，却用麻醉劑以毒害自己，否則，只浸在宿命觀中。前者是現實底地除去生命差，後者則對於生命差掩了眼睛，裝着無闗心，將意識的範圍收小。）</p>
<p>盧那卡爾斯基如是說。（見藝術論）</p>
<p>（生命差）者，是（總使生命受些限制和危險）的，即（給生命以障害）的一切事實。</p>
<p>有錢的，醇酒婦人；無錢的，聽天由命。今日的中國人的意識範圍的狹小，至於對自己一身的生存，都不想用積極的手段來維持了，遑論其他丨丨民族和國家！</p>
<p>一看同是（東洋）的日本，雖然横暴得不可理喻，但是他们其實也是被生命差所恐而然，不過較之我们，取了决定的手段罷了。看他们的一切行動，不也是在（國難），（非常時）的口號之下發作的麽？自然，在我们看來，他们的手段，是積極得未免過火了的。</p>
<p>我不想多說了，仍然引一段盧那卡爾斯基的話看看：</p>
<p>（假如或一人種，侵入别的人種所占的領域，而生活艱難起來，那末，</p>
<p>土著民可以反抗，鬥爭；但他们也可以安於平和和貧弱的生存，服從運命，而離開本土，逃向遠方的瘠薄的土地，占臣僕的地位。於是，他们漸慣於營養和食料的不足，那發育也可以縮小起來。（據魯迅的譯文節改而成）也許將來的史家，會借用這一段現成的話，作中國歷史的定論的。</p>
<h3>剌激（三）</h3>
<p>— 謝冰瑩</p>
<p>一個意外的電話來了，這是在　武漢時代一離别了七年的朋友打來的，他從廣東來，今天才到古田，無論如何要我去看他，我起初堅决地拒絶，但後來被他說的什麽一機會難得，此後不知有無見面機會一等話有點躊躇起來，在這年頭我的朋友一天天減少，誰也不知誰什麽時候死；生前有機會多見一次面，多談幾句話也是好的，想到這裹就答應了。</p>
<p>雖然有馬，可是天氣太熱，究竟要跑二十里，太划不來，自私心又在動摇了。</p>
<p>最後還是决定去！</p>
<p>是下午二時正在整裝待發的時候，忽然一個電話打來說那位朋友也許下午就走，呌我不必去。</p>
<p>於是我又煩起來了！</p>
<p>煩，煩，煩，一萬個煩！</p>
<p>隆，隆，空隆，空隆，呵呀，雷響起來了，電光四射，暴雨如傾，狂風猛烈地吹，門，窗户，吹得刮閙刮閙地響，桌上的茶杯，洋燈，茶壺都滾在地上打個粉碎，書，報紙吹得滿屋飛，暴雨從窗口打進來，滿屋子都是水，從瓦屋灑下來的更是浸濕了被蓋和枕　，眼睛也睜不開了，跑出房門，雨點像鐵片打在頭上一般劇痛，衣服也被淋濕了，頭髮上的雨點像珠子似的一顆顆掉下。</p>
<p>（呵呵，不得了，我的書籍，鋪蓋，衣服，全給打濕了！）</p>
<p>（唉！眞想不到下這大的雨的，我屋子裹也弄得一塌糊塗了！）</p>
<p>（你们還没有看見，我的房子裹簡直成了大海了！）</p>
<p>哈哈哈，聽到他们的說話，我快樂得跳了起來！不提防右脚一滑，幾乎要跌倒了。</p>
<p>（這雨眞下得痛快，現在我不難過了！）</p>
<p>就從狂風暴雨來到的，刹那起，一直到此刻丨丨晚上九點二十分丨丨爲止，我的心是恬靜的，愉快的，活躍而且得着了無窮的安慰。（完）</p>

<h3>兒女英雄跑道逐鹿記</h3>
<p>董叔昭創八百米全國新纪錄</p>
<p>錢行素力劈三闗惜成绩减色</p>
<p>百米宿如笑力勝首席昨日開幕</p>
<p>、首先决賽者卽爲百米、及格參與决賽之八人、無不抱决勝之心、故於一時左右、卽繞跑道作輕微之運動、以活動筋骨、發令蔣湘青動員令下、跑員均各佔跑線、健將程全冠、以求勝心過切、未待槍發、已衝出起跑線、致爲發令員召回、第二次再發、宿笑如起步最速、郝春德起步最遲、一路衝來、宿笑如始終在前、程郝二人在後緊趕、到達終點、程以一肩之差、屈居第二、郝又以一肩之差而列第三、薛劍秋得第四、當跑畢之後、各照相爭相攝影、笑如滿面笑容、單手向各方致意、謙謙有禮、</p>
<h3>八百米叔昭創全國紀錄　繼百</h3>
<p>米决賽者卽爲八百米、起步者共八人、槍聲發後、董叔昭卽捷足先登、槍得内圈、第二圈時、李延祥步步趕上、力道頗足、在董後僅二三米、觀者無不以爲董之大敵、至最後直徑、二人各放大步子、向終點衝剌、董叔昭訓練有素、仍能勝李延祥有四米之遥、但一路爲李所逼、馬達開足、結果居然能以二分五秒二之優異成绩、破王銘紳二分六秒八之全國紀錄、實爲大會男子田徑生色不少、李延祥雖名列第二、但其成績亦在二分七秒以内、亦屬難能可貴、董家爕侯德崇得第三第四、</p>
<p>高欄陳嘉佑努力加油　曹裕以十項闗係、放棄高欄决賽、故起步者僅五人、陳陵發脚最快、陳嘉佑最遲、至第四欄時、二陳同時過欄、自第六欄起、陳陵漸漸落後、到達終點、嘉佑竟勝五六米之遥、殊出人意料之外、陳陵屈居第二、蕭鼎華得第三陶英傑得第四、王輝普列第五、不圖檢察員之報告、陳陵與王輝普均以倒三欄而取消錄取資格、蕭鼎華與陶英傑不勞而各升一級、</p>
<p>二百米金冠重得冠軍　陳嘉佑、</p>
<p>因跳高欄以後、原氣未復、放棄决赛、故起步僅七人、程金冠鑒於百米之失敗、二百米决不敢輕易放鬆、以圖報復、其餘各人、亦各處心積慮、冀能得佔位置、在起步時、曾兩次以犯規召回重跑、可見當時空氣之緊張、競賽結果、程金冠居然如願以償、重列冠軍、恢復其短跑之地位、宿笑如反居第二、薛劍秋董寅初分得三四兩席、老將黄飛龍列第五落伍、</p>
<p>撑高跳第一符保盧</p>
<p>（啟昌攝）</p>
<p>萬米王正林成績長進　萬米跑、在未出發前、錦標早知爲王止林囊中物、其欔取冠軍易若反掌、昨日自起跑後、廿五圈始終速度如一、以三十五分五十七秒五分三跑完全程博</p>

<p>得全塲堂聲不少、陳虚舟究己年齡漸高、不如當年威風、在前十圈、尙能緊隨正林、十圈以後、漸見不支、漫漫落後、經一翻奮鬥、始得第二、徐彥博身體合適、爲長跑之良材、惜足之搬動太慢略具跳躍式、吃虧不少、張全洲身體太重、長跑恐難有進步、不如調換其他項目練習、</p>
<p>中欄陶英傑失風　中欄决賽、陶英傑不能樂觀、昨日本報曾已露布、結果居然不出所料、程金冠代而取之、惟成績仍不能進六十秒闗、不能使人滿意、陳陵爲撑竿跳放棄决賽、不然第二名位置、亦難說定誰屬、</p>
<p>四百米老將盡被淘汰　四百米跑爲徑賽中最不容易之一項、旣須速度、又須耐力、故四百米選手、往往不能持久、闗長發·何德寳、朱瑞洪、無不知爲上海四百米能手、孰意昨日决賽、俱遭淘汰、位置俱爲新進選手佔據、此足見人材之多矣、惟有一言、供獻於諸選手者、在第三轉灣後、各人應照直線進行、不應再有爭跑内圈、以阻攔他人之進行、昨日一二三三人、俱有是項弊病、以後宜力加注意、冠軍曾榮忠、功夫五三秒六、尙不多見、</p>
<p>女子五十米　得第一名之陳淑　小姐、爲厦門產、活潑而愛運動、巳於今昨兩屆萬國運動會、以及中等學校運動會中、顯露頭角、以其體格論、實較勝於錢行素、蓋以練習運動之年數較少、故其成績尙不能如錢行素之出人頭地、得第二之馬寳惠、奔跑之姿勢、已養成不良習慣、一時恐不易改良、將來難有較佳之成績、</p>
<p>女百米錢行素獨占鰲頭　在女子百米將開始時、天公固意爲難、使南風加勁、故競賽結果、成績不如前日預賽、槍聲起後、祗見錢行素小姐一馬當先、使後面諸人、漸離漸遠、至衝斷白線、以在第二人前有三米之遥、　淑卿·李宜南·李寳惠爭得二三四位置、</p>
<p>低欄錢行素二次勝利　參加决賽　　者僅五人、錢行素之勝利、早在衆人預料之下、惟以逆風闗係、成绩較前日預賽時爲退、第二曾惠瓊亦爲可造之材、如能繼續訓練、將來不在錢行素之下、第三蕭傑英、第四　志明、以脚短而吃虧、</p>
<p>二百米錢行素刀劈三闗　六人　　起跑、在終點評判臺上觀之、雖隔二百米、亦能辨别各人、蓋各人有特殊之姿勢、錢行素嬌小而步速、李宜南體重而步大、一路錢來、除錢一人在前外、其餘五人競爭頗烈、結果李宜南爭得第二、曾惠瓊王化昌得第三第四、成績爲二十九秒七、雖不能令人十分滿意、然錢行素在跪畢以後、大呼（我的媽呼一、蓋錢小姐參加項目、多至四項、人非鐵製、焉有不疲倦之理、而况閩秀乎、</p>
<h3>男女田賽决戰記</h3>
<p>錢行素又破女子跳遠全國紀錄</p>
<p>擲壘球陳榮明亦創全國新紀錄</p>
<p>撑竿跳符保盧大意失荆州</p>
<p>其他成績均接近全國紀錄</p>
<p>昨日爲田徑賽之最後一日、男女田賽共七項、女子跳遠、第一第二兩名、均破全國紀錄、冠軍錢行素跳四米八八、亞軍陳淑卿跳四米八十、擲壘球陳榮明亦以四二米九七創全國新紀錄、名聞全國、最近非正式以三米八四造全國撑竿跳紀錄之符保盧、昨　未能正式造一新紀錄、而以三米四四得冠軍、殊令人失望、事後之表演賽、則達三米七八、聊恩衆望、女鐵餅馬驥女士以二五米一六得第一、殊爲可貴、惜該項以前無正式紀錄比較耳、他如郝春德之標槍四六米十六、陳寳球之鉛球十二米十三、潘承斌之三級跳十三米○九、均與全國紀錄相差幾</p>

<h3>足球複賽最後一幕東華倖勝優游</h3>
<p>結果三比二獲得决賽權成功於李義臣最後一頂</p>
<p>丨優游表演精彩異乎往昔丨</p>
<p>東華昨日在最後一刹之間、李義臣迎得薛文繡角球、頂入優游門内、自二對二和局、轉成三對二之結果、獲得本屆全市運動會足球决賽權、明日三時將與曁南會師中華棒球塲、奪本屆錦標、　　主將去險遭不測　馮運佑病倒、闗洵安缺席、東華實力减色陣線摇動、然其能自失勢之下、轉成和局、終致勝利者、謂其得天獨厚、詢非虚語、全部軍力左面健强、右面柔弱、進攻退守、失其均衡、幾遭毒手、厥因在此、轉定乾坤、三四特殊人才之力也、</p>
<p>東華陣線</p>
<p>茫家駒　李寗　馮念漢</p>
<p>陳洪光　屠開元　吳幼良</p>
<p>萬象華　陳家球　李義臣　周光中　陳虞添（上）　薛文繡（下）</p>
<p>表演佳敗亦榮事　談及優游、不免惋惜、上半時無論矣、風助火威、咄咄迫人、彼時如射擊得法、何致僅獲十二碼罰球一隻而已、卽在逆風之中、亦能分庭對抗、論其前鋒、進展有程序、脚上盤傳工夫、又甚佳妙、内部人員、個個鎭靜、無懈可擊、敗固不必計較、然非戰之不力耳、</p>

<p>葉晋綿　黄瑞華　王寳章</p>
<p>李碩友　孫錦順　胡有成　奚巧生　沈柏貴</p>
<p>十二碼錦順立功　東華迎風開球、</p>
<p>接觸未久、優游李碩友左陲活動、孫錦順率軍隨進、聲勢浩大、李寗逞其百不失一之頭頂、化除不少危險、東華陳虞添二次傳中、恰到好處、應呼無人、唐永純出門抱得、平妥過去、優游驟變策略、改由右進、沈柏貴一馬當先、將登堂而入室、陳洪光救主心切、竟犯十二碼規則、孫錦順踼來泰然、左角人門、首勝一球、</p>
<p>顯奇能觀衆稱許　紀錄一開、兩方心理自異、揆之當時形勢、優游固攻多於守、幾次猛烈射擊悉中守門身上、孫錦順忽潛入左陲、盤球進展、射門未入、球至中部、李碩友適在猛力攻門、范守門雙手抱得、忽又落地、球向後滾、觸及門柱而止、此中殆有天意、蓋稍向右移、東華卽告失手、是球得救、東華生機來矣、瞬息之際、萬象華靜極思動、一攻再攻、包圍優游、是時半空忽下一球、李義臣不及返身、反脚一勾、神不知、鬼不覺、適落門内成一比之數、上半時剩餘之五分鐘、亦在觀象讚許聲中終了矣、　　變化中勝負互易　風助東華、五騎兼程並進、王樹森稍一大意、周光中轉出人前、空門在望、竟至射向斜去、接後優游大起三軍、奚巧生亦遭同樣之機遇、不能運用之、繼而胡沈妥又相機進展、志不得逞、球勢反趨、萬象華一渡至李義臣、再渡至薛文繡、薛力射、重如千鈞、中門柱、摇摇然若不支、石金生與陳家球在互相搶奪之中、手臂觸及球體、宣告十二碼、李義臣主賜、如願以償、東華反以二對一佔先、優游氣不少衰、進攻如故、孫錦順亂人耳目、忽然自左趨右、鐵腿起處、又成二二和數、三分鐘之後、又生變端、薛文繡踢角、李義臣頂上生眼、竟在人羣中覓得來球迎之入門、得三對二結果、獲决賽權、裁判員沈回春、巡邊劉春樹·陳國義、</p>

<h3>棒球賽約翰擊敗交通</h3>

<p>兩隊球藝、不相上下、約翰以穏靜見、長少出錯誤、爲其致勝原因、談隊不少新自檀香山歸國之華僑學生、對於此道頗有心得、交通爲江大冠軍、已有遠年歷史、然慌疏失漏、屢見不鮮、昨戰在技術上、未見有特殊高下之判别、在於錯誤之多少耳、</p>
<p>約翰　先攻開始、交大投手温聯東連放四球數三次、於是壘滿佔、賀瓊華放出安打、三人歸壘約翰乃先得三分、交大輪打、三人連下、一無進展、第二局約翰無分、交大連出三次安打、沈觀瀾張金鎔跑得二分、第三局約翰龐盤芳張永煦又得二分、交大温聯東擊一極遠極高之球、爲約翰中堅接任、往後又連殺兩人、交又無所得、第四局約翰李學文交大張金鎔各得一分、第五局約翰吳振邦代胡和德又得一分、交大零、斯時天已黑、比賽乃止、結果約翰七比三勝、　　▲各局比分</p>

<h3>▲昨以二比一勝二區</h3>
<p>昨日網球决賽、觀者甚衆、蓋二三兩區單打四選手球藝俱臻上乘、比賽結果、兩區各勝一單打、錦標誰屬待諸午後雙打决定、</p>
<p>第一單打三區張箕曾對二區孫鑑渠、孫爲上屆全運會之最佳選手、斯日竟以直落三慘敗於張之手、孫技藝不差、然其表演不慌不忙、常誘張上網、而挑送高球至後方或乘隙施以低急之旋球抽球、使彼不及還擊、張之態度極爲鎭靜、孫出球以欠管束力錯誤甚多、三盤比數如下、</p>
<p>三區張箕曾六丨三六丨三六丨一二區孫鑑渠</p>
<p>第二單打三區戴廣進對二區陳森榮、陳發球猛烈、抽擊峻急、戴供球軟弱無力、球常觸網或出界、連輸一二兩盤、第三盤戴忽奮起、攔網神妙、連取三局、陳獲一局後、戴又下三局結束是盤、第四盤起、戴曾以三對一及四對二之局數領前、奈陳頻以沉重有力抽球進攻、戴無法應付、反連輸三局、被陳超出、斯時陳神色自若、戴每輸一球、卽揮拍頓足、頗露燥急不安之狀、指導員在旁囑其鎭靜從事、三次平等局數、然陳愈戰愈勇、强有力之殺球、不絶如縷、終以十對八之局數獲勝、</p>
<p>二區陳森榮六丨三六丨四一丨六十丨八三區戴廣進</p>
<p>單打勝負未分、午後一時乃　行雙打比賽、以定錦標誰屬、雙方出塲選手依舊、三區張箕曾戴廣　、合作佳妙、戴在前攔網張把守後方、失誤甚少、二區選手孫鑑渠野球甚多、陳森榮素以發球見長、竟常致雙失誤、頻頻自殺、第一盤張戴一氣呵成五局、孫陳勉獲一局後、卽爲三區以六對一獲第一盤第二盤二區曾以二三對一佔先、無奈曇花一現、又爲三區連下數局、以六對四獲第二盤、末盤孫陳竭力進攻、然張之回擊猶如機械、常有不易挽救之球仍還過網、無懈可擊、末局戴氏兩記高壓、於熱烈鼓掌聲中、以直落三之比數奪獲錦標、</p>

<h3>時裝之美蘇鳳</h3>
<p>摩登女郎，没有一個不歡喜時裝。但一般的說來，在　擬）的情狀之下，我们見到的所請時裝，常常是非常惡劣的東西。　掣上旣少美觀，商質料與配色上尤多缺憾。</p>
<p>因爲一般的心理，但求是（一）價格之高貴；（二）出品之爲舶來。對於其他主要的條件如　如何配色，（二）如何剪裁……等等問題，都不加注意，於是時裝之爲時裝，殆僅僅爲自炫其貴高而並不爲一種愛美觀念之表見矣！</p>
<p>我以爲，時裝之美，非經濟條件所决定。故搆製時裝者，决不當以（價格高貴與否）爲選擇之目標。</p>
<p>至於（國人用國貨，）此爲必然之理，時裝之應用國貨綢緞，可不待言。</p>
<h3>西式女服標準裁剪法</h3>

<p>闗於西式女服之裁剪，我已在上期本刋言之綦詳；惟　言其前後身尺寸之比例，而四肢之如何支配，則未暇述及，茲再以前後身及，繪圖如左，俾與上期三十九英寸之奶膀爲標準袖口，完全吻合。讀者不雖按圖而索驥，詳細究，决無不合之處。然此僅示其規楷，變化如何，則仍須各人之　心自悟；刻舟求劍，則非所宜。苟從其指示，探其源而派其流，無不得心而應手也。　　▲　身圖例</p>
<p>裁剪之尺寸，如依右圖而爲之，則應如左表所列，殆無參差，而可得準確者也。（圖中人處係灣進……處係表示寛拉）</p>

<h3>現代女裝之配色法（續）</h3>
<p>儀翔</p>
<p>▲橘色　屬黄</p>
<p>形如金黄而略異故其用途亦略於金黄同。（附合色）金　棕色　橙黄</p>
<p>▲金黄色　屬黄</p>
<p>黄色類中而略有微紅者，卽爲金黄。鮮而威，麗而嚴，殊爲黄中佼佼之色。配色以搶色爲合。</p>
<p>（附合色）黑　米色</p>
<p>▲橙色　屬黄</p>
<p>橙色屬黄，以其色似橙而名也。蒼老有致，一似古人，故人亦樂用之，配色宜深艶者爲佳。</p>
<p>（附合色）棕色　紅</p>
<p>▲米色　屬黄</p>
<p>米色因其色如米也。文淡而靜，素潔而幽，亦爲黄屬之上乘，其配色以黄色類爲最宜。（附合色）橙黄　青　（未完）</p>

<p>秋風乍起，把幾月來包國我们的周遭的骨氣吹散了，我们重又回到清凉的境界。在這麽凉爽的環境中，我们偶然忽到那　寒酷冷的冬天在不久以後就要來到，却又禁不住未寒而慄。）我们記起（未雨綢　）的古訓，鑒於（臨渴掘井）的戒條，我们應當　着這温和的時節置辦些冬裝。一談到製辦冬裝，就不期然而使我们更想到呢絨的需要，因爲呢絨實爲（冬裝）最好的材料，又輭，又暖，又貼身，又能禦寒，牠有棉絮的温暖，而棉絮却没有牠的合時美觀。不過使人们所躊躇思索的，就是人们的意謂上似乎　得（呢絨）　是舶來的外國貨，以爲市上卽使有着所謂國貨也是靠不住的，也是不徹底的。這種意想，自然是在所難免的。因爲我们知道紡織呢絨是中國最新的事業，在從前我们是並不知道以羊毛紡織製爲衣着。自從歐洲輪入呢絨以　，國人於是競相購用，需要激增，才有一般商人來經營這種事業。可是織製呢絨却並不是一回簡單的事，織製呢絨的手續眞是非常的麻煩，第一我们先要把牠重要的原料羊毛除去攙含的雜質，然後再要經過洗滌，梳剔，分析，等等的手續，才可以裝上了紡織機，以後還要經過修製，整理，渲染，壓平的工作纔可以把呢絨製造完成。這樣複雜的工作所需要的各種機器，自然不是小小的經營者所能購備，於是爲了便利計那些呢絨商人只是向外國批發了現成的呢絨，改頭換面地標榜起（國貨）的名　，稍純正一些的也是向外國批來了呢絨，經過自己一番渲染加色的手續，就算是一國貨）了；再好一點的，至少其原料是向英德比等國採購來的，所以這誠無怪國人要疑想市上的呢絨都是（靠不住）（不徹底）的國貨或甚至都是（外國貨）了。</p>
<p>然而這種猜疑終于給一九二九年成立而現在正在發展中的章華國貨呢絨廠所貢獻的事實所打破了。</p>
<p>章華國貨呢絨廠以其雄厚的百萬之資本，精雇了男女工人數百名，置備了一切呢絨紡織手續上所需的機器。不但那加色渲染的工作不要仰仗外人，就是洗滌紡織也是該廠自己的工作，不但自己洗滌自己修製，並且其羊毛原料也多取給于浙西山東一帶，像湖州曹州等地方。這樣，自織自紡自染的章華廠的出品該可以說是（可靠的）（徹底的）十足道地的國貨了吧。誰說國内市塲上（國貨）呢絨都是（靠不住）呢？然而章華廠的出品是怎樣的呢？據上海社會局的試騐以後，說（堅牢耐用）和伸縮力是勝于舶來品的，至於詳細的情形，要看到南京路上該廠門市部所陳列的貨樣便可瞭然，是不必再要我來喋喋了。</p>
<p>總之，在這個國内經濟表落產業不振的（國貨年）全國國民對於一個努力經營國貨的工廠是應當予以勗勉和贊助的。</p>
<p>（二二秋式衣料圖案之六）</p>
<h3>絲織物圖案之變遷</h3>
<p>▲跟着時代而推進　川眉女士</p>
<p>吾國絲織圖案，歷來頗少變遷。富麗之品，均以龍鳳爲主，麒麟松鶴爲輔；文雅之品，大都以梅蘭竹菊爲主，回紋　字爲輔。雖其地位大小，稍有變更色彩意匠，略有異同，而其大體，則不外乎上述之原則，數十年如一日。祖母遺下之綢緞，孫女仍可服用之，而無失時之譏；大户之家，往往將綢緞繞羅，藏之箱篋中，一如金銀首飾之藴　焉。迨清季末年歐風東漸，外國綢緞，時有進口，因之絲織品之圖案，受其影響，而起變化。但變更之時間仍緩，且其變更之範圍不廣，四五年之中，不過略呈一二之異象而已：非十分考究者，無法辨别之。迄至民國肇興，舶來品日多一日，而吾國之電力絲織廠，因時而興，因之絲織物之圖案，又起變化，忽而花卉，忽而鳥獸，忽而人物，變幻旣多，更換又速，一二年之間，卽成落伍之品。近四五年來，印花綢緞通行，其變更之程序更速，立體圖案，自歐西輸入後，吾國絲織品中，卽利用而盛行。去秋及今春，斜條入時，無論印花或織品，均以斜條爲最時式，風行一時，摩登女士，無不衣被一襲，舞場上，影戲館内，甚至馬路上，隨處可以見到，眞盛極一時矣哉！但今年入夏以來，此風又衰，直條方格，乃乘時而起，柳條雙縐，柳條喬其紗，格子雙縐，格子喬其妙，銷塲均暢。今秋風送爽，新式花樣，又乘時而起。近日美亞織綢廠聯合先施公司，舉行時裝表演，及糺縵縐大展覽，琳瑯滿目，美不勝收。所見二二秋式圓圈新花樣百餘種，有大圓圈，連環圓圈，雙鎖圓圈，滿地圓圈，清地圓圈，虚點圓圈，横缐圓圈等等，無不意匠别緻，構造新奇。製成施袍新裝，肥瘦咸宜，耳目一新。會塲上銷去七萬餘尺，以此情形觀之定可代表本季花樣之標準矣。據聞：該項圓圈花樣，爲該廠重奬徵求所得於三千餘份之稿件中，由著名藝術家劉海粟江小　等所選取者，眼光是覺高人一等，實有代表時代性之圖案也。夷考世界上絲織物之區案，本以法國巴黎爲權威者，每年春秋二季，各有新式花樣發表，由各大綢緞公司及時裝公司舉行盛大展覽，世界各國絲綢商，均派有章華二二秋式女大衣呢織造圖</p>
<h3>一件晚服的樣子</h3>
<p>衣服的質料顔色，是一個值得討論的問題，而今日大家都在排斥舶來品極力提倡國貨的國難期中，的確國貨是較前大有生氣。但衣服的裁製和式樣，也不能忽略，目下流行時裝，不過是採取效法於式樣方面，並不是非要洋貨質料來製做不可。例如穿了新裝來參與盛大宴會或應酬，要比旗袍來得富麗宏耀些。這裹的一件晚服，式樣是西式，但材料是採用美亞新出的糺縵縐做成。此種衣料較紗爲結實，但不比絹緞那麽重厚，最適用於秋季時令，且係雙幅門　，製做新裝，最是妥合。該廠近來對於婦女裝束，極能悉心研究，如仕女们對於式樣方面，有什麽困難而不易解决的問題，可向該廠接洽代爲設法，想可爲照辦也。</p>
<p>代表視察一切，　帶歸國，作爲時代之標準，閨閣名媛，無不奉爲圭臬，一致服用，以爲榮幸：惟吾國事事落後，卽對此圖案一層，亦不能列入國際之間，實覺汗顔，雖由於吾國女士服裝，與泰西各國不同，不能一概而論，但至少每年春秋二季，吾國亦須有時新圖案發表，代表該時代之標準，俾摩登女士方有依據，則服裝一道始得時有進步，顯吾東方之藝術，庶不致落人之後。我以爲絲綢界之先進，如美亞織綢廠者，應提出户資，聘請藝術家，隨時研究，每年春秋二季，發表新式圖案，代表一時代之標準，以求絲綢之進步，庶吾衰落之絲綢業，有復興之一線希望焉可！</p>
<h3>時裝顧問</h3>
<p>近來婦女之服裝，時樣時有變遷，色澤圖案，亦日新月異；惟各人之年齡體格與環境，各有不同，故其式樣之剪裁，與色調之配合，極有研究之價值，尤與氣候節令及穿着場所最有闗係。一般仕士，均以此責任，委諸普通裁縫店，輒致乖謬百出，引爲憾事，本刋茲爲服務於女界起見，特設（時裝顧問部一，凡有以上項問題見訊者，可投函上海郵局第一七九六號信箱，必有詳確之答復，藉供詢問者之參考，而便採取，希讀者注意。</p>
<h3>古制的新裝　范煙橋</h3>
<p>古代女子的衣制，有現在仍舊適用的，所不用者，只是長短寛窄而已。	像下面所舉的都是，</p>
<p>▲袿　一稱一諸于。）元后傳：（衣終綠諸于。）注云：（卽大掖衣，如今之袿衣之類。）照現在說，就是披在外面的外褂。當時也用紅色的邊緣，想見其嬌麗了。又漢武帝内侍：（王母傳女服青綾之袿，容眸流盼，神姿清發。）那麽用絲織品去做的，和現在多用呢絨布的，有些不同。因爲一則取其飄逸，一則取其調節氣候與體温的。但是今年夏末秋初，新流行一種綢製的小披肩，却有些相似了。　　▲裕　　也是見於漢武内傳云：（王母上殿東向坐，着黄金褡　，文采鮮明，光儀淑穆。）釋名云；　屬也。衣裳上下相連屬也。照現在說，就是西方裝束了。年青的女子，在夏令，穿的狠多：新嫁娘尤常用這種服制的。不過没有王母那麽富麗罷了。�</p>
<p>▲倒頓　方言云：（大袴謂之倒頓。）又朱博傳：（故功曹官屬，冬衷大招。）注云：（裙大袴也。）照現在說，就是女子旗袍裹顯現出來又長又大鮮艶的大袴。不過以前女子穿裙的，袴的大小，没有人注意到，大概上面所說的，（倒頓）和（大袑，）都是男子所用的。　　▲反衣　現在的女子，喜歡把皮外袿反穿，都不是古製。漢書匡衡傳：（富貴而列士不譽，是有狐白之裘而反衣之也。）反衣是不名譽的。還有新序云：（魏文侯出遊見皮裘負薪者，問之。對白：（愛毛也。）文侯曰：（若不知裹盡而毛無所恃也。）也是反對反衣的。前清大老，要表示他品級之高，衣服之華貴，都穿反皮。外國婦女也有這意思。中國婦女去模仿伊们，其實失掉喛體的本意了。</p>

<p>實用電阻電容量計算尺</p>
<p>— 明襄</p>
<p>我们在試騐和設計電機的時候，時常遇到多個電阻並聯（Ｐaralle）或多個電容器串聯，須計算其總值的問題。通常計算的方法，無非採用下列公式：　　這公式的解算，雖不十分繁艱，但亦需費却不少寳貴時間。設有不諳代數學者，對之尤感困難。但利用本篇的計算尺，就無需引用公式，更無需麻煩的解算，祇用一個很簡單的加法，便可迅速而準確的解决了。</p>
<p>尺上分ＡＢ兩格，Ａ數爲一以下的小數，Ｂ數爲一以上的整數，Ａ數自右讀向左，Ｂ數自左讀向右。此尺計算的範圍，可無限制，爲清楚起見，僅註明ooi</p>
<p>丨丨Ｉooo　o至推算的方法，讀者一望即可明瞭，如Ａ數推至oooi，Ｂ數當爲iooooo</p>
<p>計算時須注意各數的單位，是否一致，如有不同者，必須化至同一單位後，方可計算。今試舉數例，以表明此尺的計算法：</p>
<p>例一：串聯的三電容器，其電容量爲.oo3，.oo4，，oo5mf　，求總電容量。</p>
<p>先查得Ａ數第三行的.oo3，在Ｂ數第三行的相當值爲３３３.，００４的Ｂ數慮爲２５０，．００５爲２００（若Ａ數在第二行則Ｂ數相當值亦應取第二行。餘同此），各相當值的總和爲３３３＋２５０十２００＝７８３，再尋Ｂ數７８３，其Ａ數的相當值爲．oo１２８，此即爲答數。</p>
<p>倒二：四電阻器並聯，其電阻爲５００，６５０，８００，１０００歐姆求總阻。此四數在尺上求得Ａ數的相當值爲．００２，．００１５４，．００１２５，．００１，此四相當值的總和爲．００５７９，再查Ａ數００５７９，Ｂ的相當值爲１７２，即其總阻爲１７z歐母。</p>
<p>由上例看來，計算的步驟可分爲三，先分别各被計算者係Ａ數抑Ｂ數，如Ａ數則在尺上查明Ｂ數的相當值，反之亦同，然後以各相當值總加之，復在尺上尋得此和數的相黨值，即爲最後的答數。</p>
<p>對於此類表尺，未用過的讀者，初用時或稍感困難，幾經試用，即覺便利非常，實可使我们的腦力時間，經濟不少。</p>
<h3>短波發射機之調準法及其步驟（續）</h3>
<p>— 羅靜予</p>
<p>現在我们開始討論復振盪式發射機之調準步驟了。</p>
<p>（一）先將各級屏極電壓取去，所有屏栅間之電容均置於零度。</p>
<p>（二）使振盪器發生振盪丨其法與在單振盪式發射機中所叙相同，可照樣的進行調準。倘爲石英制式，則調準的手續尤屬簡單：因石英制式的線路概屬屏栅諧振，而晶石的本身波長，又固定不變：故下降之點（即振盪情形最佳之標準點）最易覓取。</p>
<p>（三）振盪器調準後，便應着手於擴大器諸級的調準工作了。這一步手續在復振盪式中，算是最麻煩最討厭的了。因爲擴大器的目的是在將原來的週率擴大，故外來之電壓必在其栅極回路内，成一振盪線路。而輸出方面，必定取自屏極，故屏回路内亦自成一振盪綫路，當此兩振盪綫路校對至同一波長時，亦即當其振盪電流達最大數值時恰如屏栅諧正綫路，藉眞空管内部之電容最作用，屏流即回抵栅極。而此擴大級遂失其擴大之目的以生振盪。爲了拯救這種缺憾起見，於是便有加一種相　的電流，阻止屏流回抵栅極的平差法。這一種加上的相反的電流，其電流之幅，須與回來者相等，其兩相Ｐhase）之差爲一百八十度。其目的在求兩者相抵相消，而使屏栅兩回路，能夠達到互不相擾的地位。至於若是用晶石發生振盪的，其後之倍週器。因構造與擴大器是差不多的，故每級仍須平差。不過通常其屏路與栅路之波長，不一定校至相同。所　稍欠準確的平差。也很難白生振盪。至於平差的簡單原理及方法茲亦順便叙述如下第六圖Ａ即是現在上海國際電台楓林橋發報機的平差線路，圖中Ｃn　便是平差電容器，爲構造的簡便起見，其平差綫圈即爲振盪綫圈之一半。闗於平差線路的理，我们若以第六圖Ｂ來解釋，便容易領會了。圖中Ｃn＝Cgp，Ｌn=lp，倘若這時候有由Ｇ回來經Ｃgp的電流則同時由Ｃn亦有相反的電流加於栅極，而使兩方面相對的力量互相抵消。（未完）</p>

<h3>告男人</h3>
<p>— 隠仙女士</p>
<p>日前本刋有慎言君（告女人）一文，語重心長，讀之有感，擬此文以應之。</p>
<p>男人！你们幾千年的驕子啊！你们的自由，你们的權威，不必說：在姊妹行中，你们是樣樣佔着優先，單說你们的配偶，伊们不是你们豢養的奴隸囑？鞭打，辱駡，遺棄，那一樣不是隨着你们的意思施行呢？這些時，你们豔羨着歐美風化的皮毛，有時帮着女人们，捧捧大衣，提提東西，這原是你们排場面的架子，於女人有多少眞實的益處？而你们便以爲女人佔着面子，深恐這樣下去，（總有一天男人顛倒會高唱起平等的口號來）。這是何等的小氣而多慮呀！</p>
<p>再說女子職業吧，雖說是：機闗，學校，公司等地方的小小職務，可以容許一二女性插足，你们便認爲和你们發生了（生活的鬥爭）。中國這樣大，生產這樣落後，外國資本主義在國内這樣發達，國内軍閥這樣横行，你们堂堂男子漢，爲何不把未開發的事業開發起來，把外國資本家排斥出去，把贪污的軍閥官僚打倒。不從這些大處下手，却斤斤然和女性來爭職業，以爲女子奪去了你们的位置，以爲（這更使一般家裹養着三四個男孩子的人，怨得整天長吁短嘆）這是何等的近視，畏怯，不自振作？</p>
<p>至於女性们相互間的妬視和排擠，固然是女性本身的弱點，然而利用這種弱點而使女性演成一幕一幕慘劇的，何莫非是男性造成的一種環境和恐怖呢？虚榮心和自甘墮落的女子，與有妻之男子周旋，意在奪人之愛，那被奪的男子，假使是十足的正人君子，如何肯輕易把愛情給這種性情輕浮意志薄弱的女子呢？並且自革命以來，男人對妻子的棄舊迎新，欺騙侮辱的事件，上自革命領袖，黨國要人，下至商人學生，眞可以說，數不勝數。這種情形，巳成風氣。如果要想補救，在女性方面，自己應覺悟，不可貪圖物質享樂，而殘害同性。在男子方面，也應本着良心，略存些人道的觀念，那庶幾才能圖兩性的共存共榮呀！</p>
<h3>三字經</h3>
<p>— 烟橋</p>
<p>三字經相傳是宋儒王伯厚所作，明清人都有所增補，今章炎太先生重加修訂，由蘇州國學會刋行。他說：（今之敎科書，固勿如三字經遠甚矣。）在學者的眼光看去，固然貓呌狗跳，那裹及得三字經名物人事，無所不包。可是從敎育原理，兒童身心發育程度上說，一本三字經，如何能使六七齡童去記憶，假使仍舊像從前的敎授法，求其）一旦豁然貫通）未免太不摩登了。我在書塾裹，也念過這書，當時用破功夫死讀强記，唱山歌一般的背得滾瓜爛熟，實際上依然懵無所知，到現在我也知道這書内容很充實，在（三百千神）四大蒙書中，的確首屈一指，可知這書還是要有程度的纔配去讀他。至於千字文，更是滿紙典故比幼學更難懂。依我的意思，小學畢業的一年，倒不妨用作課外讀物，因爲有些人無力入中學，要緊去找職業，没有讀書機會了，讀了這三字經，有了一點常識，很有益的。</p>
<p>我從孩子们的經騐上感到現在的敎育，從幼稚生到小學畢業，這六七年的敎育效率，非常顯著，遠非書塾所能比。到了中學，爲了科目繁多，進步便頓形遲緩。所以我们要改良敎育，還得在中學階叚研究。章先生旣然垂念及此，爲什麽不編些中學生讀物比那改良三字經，不是有意思些麽。</p>
<p>說起中學生讀物，便聯想到小學生視爲瓌寳的連環圖畫了。放學還來，總是人手一編，可是内容全是演義彈詞，繪畫的粗陋，說明的不通，尤其餘事，最可怕的是封建思想的餘毒，深入潔白脆弱的小腦筋整天在學校裹所得到的敎訓，完全給他取而代之。似乎能夠注意到細微的敎育當局，把這東西認爲無足重輕了。實在與其費了許多錢，編輯什麽敎科書，與書賈爭利，何如編幾種低級讀物，像傳敎士賣福音書一般，遍及民間，一方面對不良的讀物加以取締，倒是全本訓練呢。</p>
<h3>無事可談</h3>
<p>— 抬玖</p>
<p>人生在世，大概總時常感到無事可談的沉悶罷。譬如在應酬塲中，遇到了一位相知，請敎了尊姓大名而後，接着又怎麽說呢？可是終不能不說，於是没奈何只好敷衍到天氣上去，說些（今天天氣眞好）之類。又如遇到了談談（天氣眞好），（近來貴忙丨）交情泛泛之友，冷待他固不可，可是要想同他談談，又没有什麽資料：於是没奈何只好說些（足下近來貴忙）之類。英美人彼此相見，總要說些Ｇood　morning以及How　are　you　?等刻板語句。據說不如此，不足以表示Ｇentleman的風度，然而亦可謂無聊之極了。於此可見人生在世，總時常感到無事可談的沉悶。</p>
<p>人不幸會說話，世界上又不幸出了許多事。這樣說來，似乎可以談談的事儘多著。又何必故作無聊之語呢？，然而不然。原來事情，可分爲大事小事二種。大事又再可分爲二種：即切身大事與國家大事。切身大事，如飯碗戀愛等問題，當然非到相黨時機，自不肯談。國家大事呢，則自孔老二定了（不在其位，不謀其政）及（位卑而言高，罪也）的兩條原則而後，試問又有誰敢違背聖訓，昌言無忌呢！至於小事，如（間壁人家昨夜賊倫之類）又似太瑣屑，談起來恐不免有傷大雅，所以索性不去談它了。有了上述的幾種原因，遂形成了無事可談的局面。所以人生在世，終於只好談談一天氣真好，近來貴忙。</p>
<h3>晚景</h3>
<p>— 易凡</p>
<p>在歸途中：小火輪開出了城河，進入了與乂河交界的廣坦的河面：ga，ga，……的機響趕走了一羣整千的鴨子拼命地向前掙扎丨游，似乎亦是一個生存鬥爭。</p>
<p>遼遠岸堤上有四五個，四五個赤着腿露着胸的縫夫，半身向前的拉着一條索丨一條一頭縛在一隻笨大的船的桅桿上的索，可是他们並没唱起什麽船夫曲起來，否則倒要疑心是在伐爾加的河邊上呢。</p>
<p>河，遠遠地平廣坦漾的河，没有風和波，平得好似比柏油馬路還要平，假如能行汽車的話。稍微有一些風起，看上去又好似石子路。但我從没有走過這般平坦的路，世界上也似乎還没有這般的康莊大道吧？</p>
<p>離都市稍遠了，但仍能夥望到工廠的大烟囱和古廟的塔的高層：烟囱裹冒出烟仝時又有放汽聲。</p>
<p>太陽向着青青的山背後跑去，回光反照到全船身，全河南，也許是全世界。塘岸上有五十多個，五十多個男的女的，老的少的，他们提着竹籃，飯榼……很快地向前走去。金黄色的餘輝斜射到他们的全身，紅噴噴地似乎營養得很好，他们談笑着，好似很高興的。這不止一次，就是在兩天也看得見他们撑着傘的一羣祇露出幾十條腿動的光景。</p>
<p>是農村經濟的崩潰，還是都會工廠業的發達？</p>
<p>整千的貧農奔向都會的工廠裹去，結果是再由工廠吐出來到墳墓裹去，他们好似正在行着這樣一個進程而點綴着塘岸上的一個晚景。</p>

<p>生意經（四十三）</p>
<h3>（飛滙）是什麽？</h3>
<p>飛滙是什麽？就是把滙給人家的銀票丨滙票封固在信内。從飛行機寄遞到目的地。這種滙兌方法。就稱飛滙。</p>
<p>飛滙是滙兌業務種類中新興的一種。又快又妥。在滙兌業務上占着重要地位。（目下航空路綫不長。或有仍須借助於普通郵政的路程。）其快捷有時不遜於電滙。其穏妥乃同於其他憑票滙兌。可以有滙票根條的筆跡圖章核騐。他能夠兼有電滙和憑票騐兌兩種的優點。所以爲一般人歡迎。尤其是一方需欵甚亟和一方恐防錯誤的人。在着經濟不景氣的現代。是爲大衆的需要他。</p>
<p>（飛滙一這一個名辭。最近才時常在報紙和書本上發現。在五年以前。我们市場上還没有這飛滙的業務。就是這（飛滙）兩個字的新名辭也不常看見。因爲飛滙是依靠着飛機寄遞的。和電匯的恃着電報相同。飛行事業發展不久。所以飛匯的業務和名辭也發生不久。</p>
<p>歐美的飛滙業務開始。離今也不久吧。我们中國創辦這種業務。只有四年二個月。記得在民國十八年七月八日滬蓉綫航空開始丨交通部創辦航空郵政丨時。我因爲集郵的闗係。首先嘗試這飛匯創舉。這還是郵政局創辦的。近來纔看見申報廣告上有幾家銀行的繼起。可見這種業務有發展必要的可能。</p>
<p>飛匯是什麽？有許多商人抱着懷疑的互相問着丨我所以不嫌沉長的說了一下</p>

<h3>兩件事的對照　光漢</h3>
<p>日本轟動全世界的五一五事件，曾經軍法處幾番審問，終於在昨日判决；計兇犯後藤映範等十一人，各處徒刑四年。由日本這一事件，我们聯想到中國另一事件。這另一事件就是鋤奸團事件，也經法院判决清楚；計劉崇武等幾個人，各處徒刑七年。</p>
<p>現在拿這二事來對照一下。</p>
<p>日本五一五案件，是軍人暗殺首相犬養毅的陰謀，是一件驚天動地的大暴動：其案情和罪狀的重大，自不待言；但判决的結果，却僅以四年徒刑了事。回看我國鋤奸團的案件，這在所謂法律的觀點上，雖也是一種越軌的行爲；惟究其犯罪的動機和情况，則是出於愛國心所激發，是一種愛國運動，而審問的終局，竟判上一個重罪丨徒刑七年。</p>
<p>彼一事也，此亦一事也。爭權爭利去殺害一位堂堂一國的元首，只監禁四年；爲國爲民以鋤滅幾個卑鄙喪心的奸徒，反坐牢七載。這還有什麽話說！</p>
<p>聽說五一五案判决後，日本法西斯派，雖在表面上强硬主張無罪，其實亦甚滿意；只有無產黨，却在那裹大倡不平；以爲這和勞工的團體運動比較，同爲日本國民，所受法律上治罪，相差甚巨，云云。我說，日本無產黨，未免太不識時務，太不知足。不見夫我國乎？我國不久之前，天津不是曾拘捕着一個罪大惡極的賣國賊嗎？結果反遣了幾個衛兵，派了幾位官員，恭而敬之的用摩托車把他護送到日本租界去哩丨至劉崇武等那些青年怎樣了呢？他们偏不守己安分，偏要借愛國之名，出來搗亂，讓他们去嘗嘗幾年的鐵窗滋味，也是活該丨我们就是要喊寃枉，也無從喊起哩！</p>

<h3>一個泥人　賓符</h3>
<p>烈日當空，老席跑得滿臉是汗。看看那綠蔭紛紛的（惜泡小築）巳是在望，可不知怎的，心頭忽然起了一陣不可遏止的劇躍，而同時掛滿了汗的臉兒也更感到一種特殊的燒熱，不是由於氣候而發生的熱。他把脚步弛緩了下來，極力節　那複雜的情緒，然而，顯然的，節制的力量决計敵不過情思的澎湃。這尤其是離（惜抱小築）愈近，愈使他感到不安，雖然他現在是像（半步）樣的踱着，可是離（惜抱小築）終於愈近了。</p>
<p>（衛生冰琪琳丨冰琪琳丨）在（惜抱小築）左近幾十步外的一株大白楊樹下，聚集着一夥赤膊的人们，有的笑着，有的談論着，有的正是鼾聲呼呼地在草地上尋好夢，一個胖的正拚着大量的力在摇冰琪琳，一個年青的則高聲嚷着呌買主。在這時候，老席對於（冷悠悠）的冰琪琳的渴望正如賣冰琪琳的對於（穿着長衫）的買主如老席的渴望一樣。老席放下了左臂下挾了多時的方盒子，脫去滲透了汗的夏布長衫，掛到白榻的樹枝上，他就於賣冰琪琳者的歡迎聲中在一條板凳上坐下了。他這才透過一口氣來。三個銅子的冰琪琳和那賣冰琪琳者歡迎的熱情，使他忘記了一切。他感到心神俱爽，他忘記了一切。</p>
<p>他感到世界上的人都是可愛的了，可不是麽？這裹的幾個赤膊的人對於跑了路受了熱的生疏的我的同情和歡迎是多麽懇摯而眞切啊丨說他们僅是爲了十個銅子的生意經，那可未免太侮辱他们了。他想着想着，然而一想到對面（惜抱小築）裹面的狗，孩子，奶娘，以及主婦，這種輕易的肯定似乎又被他否定了。</p>
<p>一想到這，他不禁檢起那個放在地下的方盒子，打開來時，一個（相貌堂堂）（笑逐顔開的（無錫大阿福）的泥人出現了，這就引集了赤膊的人们的好奇的眼光，有許多孩子還跑了攏來垂着涎兒欣賞着。可是他却吝嗇地馬上收藏起來了，沉重　　了口氣。</p>

<p>雖然說老席還只是三十歳的人，　世故鳳霜的皺紋，在他的驗龐上　住了青春壯健的風采，誰也會相信他一定巳度過四十個的寒暑了。雖然說他脫離了大學生活巳經有了整了的七年，但是七年的當中，他有職業的時間，還不到短時的七月。雖然說他也有　妻愛女的美滿幸福，可是長期的失業使他要養不活他们，妻子兒女的重果，相反地只成爲他的痛苦和悲哀。</p>

<p>谷科長頗念舊情，在老席五六次的訪問以後的僅一次的晤見中，就答應他在（相當）的時候給個找個（相當）的位置。這個（答應），很使老席安慰，他快樂地回去告訴給妻聽，也頗引起妻的（熱心）。因此，妻更迫切地慫恿老席時常到（惜抱小築）去跑，不要讓足跡疏遠了，妻常娓娓不倦地勸老席多和谷太太招呼，妻常整夜不寐地替老席織補長衫或是修理西裝，想把老席裝扮得齊整些，這樣到（惜抱小築）去便不致失了體面。妻的苦心是老席所深知的，然而（惜抱小築）之於老席，終究是一條畏途。</p>
<p>（惜抱小築）裹的那個主婦，女傭，孩子以及狗最使老席害怕的，當老席一脚跨進門的時候，那隻畜生，那隻擺耳黑毛的狗畜生便要隨着門鈴的響聲狂吠起來，張牙舞爪地奔向他的身邊亂竄，一定要客人經了長久的受窘以後，這纔從坐在中堂門前的小桌邊做女紅的谷太太的口中發出了一聲冷淡淡的喝止：（熟人呢，呌什麽？）</p>

<h3>Song Zheyuan Returns to Zhangjiakou</h3>
<p>The Situation in Inner Mongolia is Complex, the Central Government Dispatches Personnel to Provide Comfort</p>
<p>(Beiping) Song Zheyuan returned to Zhangjiakou this afternoon, accompanied by Qin Dechun, Xiao Zhenying, Guo Zhihan, and Wei Lantian. Song explained that he had been away from Chahar for many days, many affairs awaited his attention, and banditry was rampant in eastern and northern Chahar, so he was returning to the province to handle everything. After the Fang (referring to the Japanese) troops arrived in Huairou, the Ji (referring to the Japanese) troops are now in the Heishuigou area at the border of Rehe and Chahar. This area is a long and strategically important ravine between two mountains, but the future direction of the Ji troops' activities is still unknown. Regarding the handling of this issue, the authorities have formulated proper measures to prevent its expansion. After returning to Zhangjiakou, he will go to Zhangbei if necessary. (Special dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Song Zheyuan told reporters at the train station that he had visited He Yingqin this morning to request instructions on two matters: (1) The issue of suppressing bandits in eastern Chahar; temporarily order the Zhao Division to cease operations until negotiations are properly concluded, and then continue suppressing bandits. (2) The issue of comforting Inner Mongolia, which will be handled by the central government. The Central Government has already dispatched Ba Wenjun, the Pacification Envoy for the Mongolian banners, to proclaim the central government's intentions. Because Jiang (Chiang Kai-shek) telegraphed urging him to return, he telegraphed Jiang this morning reporting his return to Chahar. (Special dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Song Zheyuan's special train arrived at Xiahuayuan at 4 p.m. this afternoon. Liu Ruming boarded the train to meet Song and report on defense matters. (Special dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A telegram from Zhangjiakou reports that Ruan Xuanwu arrived in Zhangjiakou from Kangbao with a convoy of twenty-one trucks. Huang Shouzhong, the commander of the Chahar Provincial Guerrilla Force, came to Zhangjiakou to meet Song and report on the reorganization of his unit. (Special dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Director of the Chahar Provincial Education Department, Lü Fu, firmly resigned. Yesterday, someone recommended Zhao Boying to succeed him. Zhao will take office after the central government approves the appointment. He Yun is working hard to raise military funds for Chahar Province. There are currently no concrete measures for local relief. (Special dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Wan Fulin went to Pingxikou last night and returned to Beiping today. Rumors that he went to Miyun are inaccurate. (Special dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Xiao Zhenying stated that he is accompanying Song back to Zhangjiakou. Song believes that the Inner Mongolia issue is complex and plans to send Xiao to Pangjiang. In the future, either Central Committee member Bai Yunti or Supervisory Committee member Yue Jingtao will be sent to conduct propaganda to prevent the situation from escalating. Transportation from Zhangjiakou to Pangjiang is normal. (Special dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Pang Bingxun is still modestly declining the position of Bandit Suppression Commander of Chahar Province. Pang indicated that he would only agree to take on a portion of the bandit suppression work. (Special dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<h3>Old Mouse Bandit Gang Attacks Funing County</h3>
<p>Calling Themselves the East Asia Allied Army, Yu Xuezhong Sends Troops to Suppress Them, Situation Eased Last Night</p>
<p>Bandit Activity is Also Intense at Beidaihe, Liushouying and Other Places</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The bandit leader Old Mouse, formerly a bugler in Tang Yulin's army named Zhang Kuiyuan, gathered a bandit crowd of five to six thousand and wanted to pass through Funing to Yutian. County Magistrate Liu Xingpei was ordered not to allow them through. The bandits then attacked the county seat, erecting cannons on Zijin Mountain outside the city and threatening the city. The city's security team and civilians, totaling over a thousand, defended the city. County Magistrate Liu telegraphed the provincial government in distress on the 21st, 22nd, and 23rd. Yu Xuezhong ordered Dou Xizhe of the War Zone Security Corps to send three companies to provide support. The situation had eased by the evening of the 22nd. North Ning Road passenger trains passed Liushouying and Zhangjiazhuang at night with lights off and speeding to prevent train robberies. (Special dispatch, 22nd) (Beiping) A portion of Old Mouse's bandit gang, approximately two thousand strong, captured Funing County yesterday, causing extreme burning and killing. After raiding Funing, the gang fled towards Sanhe. The majority of them are concentrated at Yanghe Bridge in eastern Luan, committing rape, plunder, and all kinds of atrocities. Residents of Qinhuangdao, Liushouying, and other places have all fled. Currently, the gang is only a little over one mile from the North Ning Railway line, but they have not yet disrupted the safety of train operations. (Special dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Li Zeyi returned to Beiping from Tianjin last night and stated: "This southern trip lasted more than a month. I arrived in Tianjin the night before last and visited Yu Xuezhong yesterday. The banditry in eastern Luan is due to the proliferation of branches in the war zone, and there is still no concrete solution. It is internally determined that Yin Rugeng and Tao Shangming will remain as administrative inspectors, and the announcements should be made soon. Huang Fu will return to Beiping by the end of this month or the beginning of next month at the latest. The issue of Fang Zhenwu's troops occupying Huairou is being negotiated with the Japanese. Lei Shourong came to Beiping from Tianjin this afternoon. The banditry in eastern Luan is rampant, and the area within a mile and a half of the railway line is a bandit zone. The Hebei Provincial Government has still not made a concrete decision on dispatching troops for suppression or organizing security teams. At the same time, because Huang is delayed in Shanghai, there is no one to preside over the negotiations, and only a few individuals are negotiating with the Japanese. The Japanese have never given a definite response. If we dispatch troops to suppress the bandits, the Japanese will unreasonably use this as an excuse to obstruct us. This matter has effectively stalled. As for the rumors of Funing's capture, the official has not received a formal report." (Special dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Bandit leader Old Mouse came to Tianjin from Dalian a few days ago and had some contact with the Japanese garrison headquarters. It is rumored that the Japanese side provided him with 60,000 yuan in activity funds, and the Kwantung Army's Sakahara is extremely helpful to him. According to Yu Xuezhong, the bandits in the war zone all have backgrounds and are gathering in increasing numbers. Yu is determined not to recruit them. He does not object to others recruiting them, but the provincial treasury cannot approve the funds. (Special dispatch, 22nd) (Beiping) A person from eastern Luan stated that bandits are everywhere in the counties of eastern Luan. There are over three thousand in Shimenzhai, and over five thousand are gathered near Yanghe Bridge in Beidaihe. A large number also forcibly entered Funing city, and another group fled towards Sanhe, harassing and looting all day long. The villages are being looted, and the houses of residents who flee are being burned. Small groups of bandits have been found lurking outside the Beidaihe train station, and merchants' stored grain and clothing have all been looted. Merchants in various places have been extorted for large sums of money, and it is rumored that the bandits plan to move their headquarters to Beidaihe. Refugees are terrified and are fleeing in droves. The banditry is most severe in Beidaihe, Liushouying, Shimenzhai, and Funing. (Beiping) Liu Shisun stated that banditry in eastern Luan is very serious. Our special envoy sent to Changchun has returned to Tianjin. We have decided to suppress the bandits first. I went to Tianjin a few days ago and have already discussed the implementation measures with Yu, and a decision should be made and implemented within a few days. I plan to go to Tianjin again tomorrow morning. (Special dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Old Mouse's bandit gang is flying the flag of the East Asia Allied Army, attempting to contact Fang and others. The provincial government is actively preparing to rush-organize special police to enter the war zone to suppress the bandits. (Special dispatch, 22nd)</p>

<h3>Review Period for Beiping Military Council to be Postponed</h3>
<p>(Beiping) The Military Council previously decided to review the various units in North China on October 1st. However, because the armies have been ordered to implement downsizing, it will be difficult to complete this in the near future, so the review period will be postponed. (Special dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The inspection starting on October 1st will only be for Yu Xuezhong and Wang Yizhe's units. (Special dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<h3>Wang Haoji Departs to Inspect Cavalry Stations on the Beiping-Hankou Line</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Wang Haoji, the Cavalry Supervisor of the Training and Supervision Department, departed for the Beiping-Huangzhou line yesterday and will arrive in Shizhuang today to inspect the cavalry stationed there.

<h3>Liu Guitang Reappointed Bandit Suppression Commander of Eastern Chahar</h3>
<p>(Beiping) After the reorganization of Liu Guitang's troops stationed in Chicheng and Longguan, he recently requested to increase the number of regiments by three. The Beiping military authorities approved the addition of some troops and increased the monthly allowance by 5,000 yuan. Liu expressed dissatisfaction with the title of Guerrilla Commander of Eastern Chahar given to him during the reorganization. The authorities have changed his title to Bandit Suppression Commander of Eastern Chahar, which has been announced. (Special dispatch, 22nd)</p>

<p>(Chongqing) Liu Xiang has dispatched troops to garrison Yazhou, disarming and dismissing the remnants of Liu Wenhui's troops. It is reported that Liu Wenhui only led several hundred guards and retreated to Ningyuan, completely ending the Sichuan military affairs. (Special dispatch, 21st)</p>
<h3>Third Anniversary of the Death of Former President Tan</h3>

<h3>Train Derails on Beiping-Suiyuan Railway When Land Collapses Near Yifeng Village</h3>
<p>(Beiping) While a freight train was passing through Yifeng Village on the Beiping-Suiyuan Railway, the land suddenly collapsed, and the tracks were broken. Three cars derailed and overturned. Jin Tao, the director of the Engineering Department of the Beiping-Suiyuan Railway Bureau, went to the site this afternoon to inspect the situation and supervise the repair work. ((Special dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<h3>Entangled Hui Army Attacks Kashgar</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) A telegram from Dihua relayed information from Kashgar stating that recently, Yimin Sihan, a turbaned leader from Hotan, led an army of over a thousand men, intending to occupy both the Hui and Han cities of Kashgar. Ma, the commander stationed in the Han city, along with the military and civilians, went out of the city to meet the attack. As a result, their leader was captured, and they were disarmed. At the same time, seven or eight hundred Heihe people were discovered in the mountains on the border, led by their leader, also attempting to make trouble. Their leader was also captured and taken into custody. It is said that after this incident, there will be many future troubles. It is heard that the Han people in Kashgar city still do not dare to walk in the streets. (Special dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<h3>Yan Huiqing Unable to Attend the League of Nations Due to Illness</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Foreign news states that Foreign Minister Luo was originally planning to go to Shalimbopolokinsk in Russia. No telegram has arrived in the capital recently, so it is expected that he is en route. Luo had originally agreed with Ambassador Yan Huiqing to meet in Shalim, but a telegram was received from the embassy in Moscow stating that Ambassador Yan had a cold and was unable to make the trip. Yan will not be able to attend the League of Nations General Assembly to be held in Geneva on the 25th of this month. The position of chief delegate will be temporarily held by Minister Gu Weijun. Delegates Gu and Guo should arrive in Geneva within the next few days. Acting Foreign Minister Wang will telegraph instructions on our side's approach to the General Assembly, but there is apparently no concrete proposal yet. (Special dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<h3>Central Machinery Plant is Under Planning</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Guo Chuntao said, the Central Steel Plant is to be managed by the National Economic Commission. It is difficult to effectively carry out large-scale industrial construction projects in China without a strong organization of the United Nations. In the future, the National Economic Conference will control the national construction industry, and the future is full of great hope. The Ministry of Industry is currently planning to establish the Central Machinery Plant. The funding comes from the British Boxer Indemnity, the contract has been signed, and the building design has also been drawn up. All that is missing now is the cash to build the factory, which is about 300,000 yuan. It was originally planned that the Ministry would raise the money on its own, but because the budget was cut, it was impossible to allocate the funds. It is planned to continue borrowing cash from the Boxer Indemnity Association to build the factory. Once it is agreed, construction can begin. (Special dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<h3>Ministry of Finance Unifies Tax Revenue in North China</h3>
<p>Starting with Reorganizing the Changlu Salt Tax and Stamp Tax on Tobacco and Alcohol Revenues</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Financial circles reveal that the total revenue of North China is only 2.5 million, and some of this is central tax revenue. It is far from enough to cover military and administrative expenses. After detailed discussions between Huang Fu, Yu Xuezhong, and Jiang Wang Song, the first step is to reduce military pay. There has been considerable progress in this direction, but it still depends on the actual situation after implementation. After the pay cut, the central government will still have to subsidize the region with over two million yuan each month. Given the central government's current financial situation, it is difficult to continue adding such a huge burden. After discussion at the Central Political Committee and the State Council, it was decided that the Ministry of Finance will unify tax revenue in North China and quickly develop reorganization measures to gradually increase revenue and prevent the source of income from drying up. It is currently heard that the Ministry of Finance's first step is to reorganize the Changlu Salt Tax and Stamp Tax on Tobacco and Alcohol revenues. The original主管署局 shall be supervised to quickly find new sources of revenue, prevent embezzlement, and streamline redundant agencies. The original Hebei Finance Special Commissioner's Office, since Jing Youyan resigned, has not been filled and will now be abolished. Detailed reorganization measures will be decided and implemented after Song goes north to inspect the actual situation. (Special dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<h3>Lianghuai Salt Reclamation Matters Merged into the Economic Commission</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Lianghuai Salt Reclamation Conference decided to designate Lianghuai as a special forestry and reclamation zone and to establish a special reclamation committee to be responsible for its implementation. However, the salt part belongs to the Ministry of Finance, and the reclamation affairs should belong to the Ministry of Industry's jurisdiction. Now that Minister of Finance Song Ziwen has proposed that the Economic Commission use American cotton and wheat loans to plant cotton in the Lianghuai salt reclamation area to increase production, which is the same as the purpose of the Salt Reclamation Conference. In order to unify authority and avoid conflicts, it was decided to merge this matter into the Economic Commission. The cases and plans already decided by the Salt Reclamation Conference will be sent to the Economic Commission for reference. (Special dispatch, 22nd)</p>

<p>Since the new Japanese Foreign Minister Hirota Koki took office, there has been much talk of changes in Japanese diplomats. Vice Minister Shigemitsu, with his association with Kijūrō Shidehara diplomacy, will likely lose his position. Major changes are also being prepared for envoys stationed in Europe and the United States. Yesterday, it was reported that the envoy to China was also planning to replace Akira Ariyoshi with Hachiro Arita. The Japanese embassy claims not to have received the news of the envoy's change. However, we believe that the spread of this news is not without reason. It is especially important to pay attention to the person of Hachiro Arita. His affairs and his person both deserve discussion.</p>
<p>Who is Hachiro Arita? What relationship has he had with China in the past? We do not need to seek materials far and wide. We only need to recall Arita's role in the two major incidents between China and Japan in the past five years to understand thoroughly. When the Jinan May 3rd Incident occurred in 1928, Arita, as a counselor at the embassy in Germany, was summoned back by Foreign Minister Tanaka Giichi and appointed Director of the Asia Bureau to plan steps for aggression against China. Several months after the Shenyang September 18th Incident occurred in 1931, Kenzō Adachi was the foreign minister. At that time, Arita was serving as envoy to Austria and was recalled to serve as vice minister, presiding over so-called hard-line diplomacy. These two incidents were Japan's most aggressive actions against China. The Japanese Foreign Ministry successively recalled Arita from abroad, making him bear heavy responsibilities, which means Arita is an expert in aggression against China. After the news of Arita's appointment as envoy to China was released yesterday, the report from Beijing showed a great deal of anxiety. One has to ask what is the intention of the Japanese Foreign Ministry in preparing such a person to take office as the envoy to China. However, if this news is somewhat credible, then the Chinese government should not hesitate to rise up and engage in opposition activities as soon as possible. The Ota Yuji (Aegleman) issue in the winter of 1930 is not far away. Do the same thing again. Now is the time.</p>
<p>Before Hirota took office as the Japanese foreign minister, he planned to visit China to mediate Sino-Japanese relations. Now that he has taken office, his first diplomatic action towards China is to appoint the most unsuitable person as an envoy. This matter is contradictory and difficult to believe. Moreover, Hachiro Arita is not the top choice among the so-called Kasumigaseki figures in Japan. Last June, he was criticized by the Japanese newspapers as "lacking common sense" for his inappropriate words during a conversation with the British envoy. Now he has been dismissed by Uchida without reason. Even if Foreign Minister Hirota wants to change the envoy to China, he does not have to appoint this person. However, Japanese politics has been manipulated by the military for the past two years, and contradictions and bizarre events are emerging one after another. It is difficult to predict what it will do by reasonable means. The news of Arita's appointment as envoy to China has undoubtedly given a head-on blow to those in our country who are trying to smooth things over and do not want to deal with Japan with a firm attitude. If this blow can arouse resentment and lead to preparations for a decisive expression, then this is what the people of the country expect.</p>
<p>Recent Tokyo dispatches regarding the changes in Japanese diplomats are complex and, in fact, largely related to factions. It is essential to analyze them. Coincidentally, the ninth issue of this newspaper's monthly magazine, Japanese Communications, contains a table of Japanese diplomatic factions. It is specially included for reference to help readers understand recent Japanese diplomacy.</p>

<h3>Tax on Imported Foreign Rice Will Be Implemented Soon</h3>
<p>Temporary Registration of Quantity of Foreign Rice Transported to Guangdong</p>
<p>(Nanjing) At the National Food Conference convened by the Ministry of Finance last winter, it was resolved to levy import duties on foreign rice. Subsequently, officials were sent to investigate several southwestern provinces, and it was found that domestic rice was still insufficient and a large amount of foreign rice was needed. To avoid burdening the people, this proposal was temporarily suspended, and orders were issued to all provinces to lift the ban on the export of rice grains to facilitate the circulation of grains as a prelude to the future implementation of import duties on foreign rice. Recently, the rice-producing provinces, in view of the fact that foreign rice has flooded the market in recent years and the sales of domestic rice have been severely affected, have jointly telegraphed the Executive Yuan, requesting that the implementation of import duties on foreign rice be expedited to allow domestic rice sales to improve slightly. After receiving the report, the Executive Yuan handed it over to the Ministries of Finance, Industry, and Foreign Affairs for review and designated the Ministry of Finance to convene a review meeting of relevant agencies. The representatives signed their opinions, and the preliminary tax rates will be submitted to the Legislative Yuan for drafting. Results should be obtained soon. (Special dispatch, 21st)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) After Guangdong Province announced the levy of foreign rice tax from the 16th, as of the 22nd, the foreign rice transported to Guangdong has not been taxed. The Special Tax Bureau only registered its quantity and released it. According to Bureau Chief He Chunfu, the foreign rice tax in Guangdong will be used entirely for rural relief and will definitely not be allocated to government expenses. If the central government levies foreign rice tax, Guangdong will abolish the special tax. The Rice Merchants Association convened a meeting of counterparts from various ports on the 21st and decided to first submit a report to the senior agencies to abolish the foreign rice tax. If the goal is not achieved, a large-scale petition will be held. (Special dispatch, 22nd)</p>

<p>Changing Administration of Chinese Eastern Railway, Soviet Russia Protests to Japan</p>
<h3>Attempt to Seize the Railway: Unbearable Actions of the Puppet State; Japan Should Be Held Responsible; Red Army Demonstrations on the Manchurian Border; Negotiations to Sell the Railway Still Deadlocked</h3>
<p>(Moscow) Soviet Deputy Foreign Commissar Sokolnikov delivered a statement to Japanese Ambassador to Russia, Ota, today, issuing the following grave warning: The Soviet government believes that the Japanese government should be held directly responsible for the (Manchurian) government's intention to undermine existing treaties related to the China Eastern Railway and to seize the railway. Sokolnikov's statement said, (According to reliable information obtained by the Soviet government, the Manchurian authorities, under the instigation of the Japanese government, intend to implement various unilateral changes to the China Eastern Railway's administration that would absolutely undermine the existing order. Specifically, they intend to reduce the powers of the Soviet Director of the Railway, effectively making him subservient to the Manchurian Deputy Director. At the same time, the Manchurian authorities, under the direction of agents of the Japanese government, are preparing to interfere in various ways with the Russian employees of the China Eastern Railway using police force. The Soviet government now authorizes me to issue the following warning on behalf of the government: The Soviet government considers the implementation of such plans in Harbin or similar plans to undermine the existing situation stipulated by treaty to be actions that run counter to the obligations undertaken by the governments of Tokyo and Fengtian, and also an unacceptable attempt to seize the railway. The Soviet government believes that the direct responsibility for such destructive actions should be borne by the Japanese government. To reiterate, all actions that undermine existing treaties related to the China Eastern Railway and attempts to seize the railway should be the direct responsibility of the actual master of Manchuria, namely the Japanese government. As for the weak and powerless (Manchurian) state, it cannot be held responsible for Manchurian affairs," and so on. Soviet Ambassador to Japan Yurenev has also received instructions to make the same representations to the Japanese government. (TASS dispatch, 21st)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Foreign Ministry spokesman said today, referring to reports that the Russian Deputy Foreign Minister protested to the Japanese ambassador that the (Manchukuo) was illegally changing the administration of the China Eastern Railway under the instigation of the Japanese government, that the Japanese government had not received this protest. In the view of the Japanese, the Soviets should not use the term "(Japanese government instigated)". (Manchukuo) only wants to conduct purely commercial operations within the scope of the Shenyang and Beiping treaties. (Manchukuo is an independent sovereign state, and Japan is not responsible for its actions, but Japan is responsible for the defense of (Manchukuo) according to the agreements between the two countries," he said. (Reuters dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Changchun) According to reports from official circles in Changchun, military supplies are currently being continuously transported into Hailanpao, including field guns, etc. The Russian soldiers there are all equipped with gas masks and conduct daily demonstrations, the purpose of which is to intimidate (Manchukuo) and prevent it from taking active reforms on the China Eastern Railway. Appreciating the seriousness of the situation, official circles urgently dispatched 150 police officers to Heihe, with orders to actively protect the interests of (Manchukuo). At the same time, Koiso, Chief of Staff of the Kwantung Army, recently returned from an inspection of northern Manchuria and expressed his views to reporters, saying that the (Manchukuo) military and police should be sent to the north to curb any disturbances caused by the extreme and frightening actions of the Russian army on the border. The Soviet Union is currently concentrating large forces along the northern border and building strong defensive works. The motives behind these actions of the Russians are unknown. (Manchukuo) urgently needs to find ways to have its rights respected. He deeply feels that the Japanese (Manchurian) authorities need to pay special attention to the development of Hulan. It borders Russia to the west and Outer Mongolia to the south, and Outer Mongolia is occupied by the Communist Party, so its development is extremely important, not only from a security perspective. The achievements of the head of Hulan, Mr. Lin, are quite good and should be maintained, Koiso also said that one of Hulan's main products is wool, the land is fertile, and there are many fish in the rivers and lakes, and there are also many untapped natural resources such as gold, coal, and oil mines. (Reuters dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The illegal negotiations for Russia to sell the China Eastern Railway continued at the Japanese Deputy Foreign Minister's residence at 10:00 a.m. today. The puppet side still insisted on a price of 50 million yuan, with each ruble valued at 2.5 jiao in Japanese currency. The Russian side believes that the puppet side has not changed its policy of forcibly seizing the railway and expressed great dissatisfaction, unwilling to raise the issue of ruble valuation, and strongly demanded that the puppet side show sincerity, so the meeting still yielded no results. The Russian ambassador visited the new Foreign Minister Hirota at 2:30 p.m., accusing the puppet side of insincerity and demanding that the Japanese side make the puppet state change its attitude. Foreign Minister Hirota told the Russian ambassador that he demanded that the Russian side clearly state the ruble's valuation and that the time for mediation had not yet arrived.

<h3>U.S. Recognition of Soviet Russia Only a Matter of Time</h3>
<p>Restore Trade Relations First, Then Proceed with Political Recognition; Domestic Opposition Disappears</p>
<p>(Washington) The U.S. government is now publicly proceeding with the issue of recognizing Soviet Russia. Secretary of State Hull admitted that the cabinet is considering the matter, but it is still difficult to determine when a firm decision will be made. It is said that the American Federation of Labor and various religious groups no longer oppose it, and the President also feels that he can proceed with the resumption of relations without major opposition. In about a week, a special committee will be appointed to first negotiate a trade agreement with Soviet Russia, and then handle political recognition. It is expected that a trade agreement can be concluded before October 1. It is said that the U.S. President firmly believes that restoring fair trade relations with Soviet Russia and extending loans to Russia by the Financial Rehabilitation Corporation will benefit American industry and commerce and allow tens of thousands of unemployed men and women to regain employment. As for the location for negotiating the trade agreement, it will likely be either Washington or New York, and the name of Morgenthau is being mentioned most often as a candidate for the committee. Furthermore, according to someone from the American Federation of Labor, the U.S. President showed a friendly attitude towards labor when negotiating industrial codes, so the union no longer opposes recognizing Soviet Russia.

<h3>Japan and France Attempt to Jointly Develop Northeast Resources</h3>
<p>Toury-Viaud is Investigating in Manchuria; Industrial Tycoons are Hiding Behind the Scenes</p>
<p>(Paris) The French business and financial communities are quite interested in the untapped market of Manchuria. Recently, a man named Toury-Viaud went to Manchuria to investigate for two months and will return to Paris at the end of September. He will report the findings of his investigation to the National Economic Development Association. Although Toury-Viaud's trip is outwardly described as a private investigation, it is said that steel, electrical machinery, and textile giants are behind the scenes, and it is also rumored that he wants to investigate the market for war materials.

<h3>League of Nations Administrative Council Meeting; Japan Worries About Discussion of Non-Recognition of Puppet State; Hirota Cables Ito to Rush to Geneva</h3>
<p>China Cooperates with the League of Nations on Opium Prohibition</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Administrative Council held a closed meeting at 10:40 a.m. this morning to discuss administrative and budgetary issues. Dr. Wellington Koo represented China and attended. The public meeting began half an hour late to discuss issues such as knowledge cooperation, the establishment of the International Committee on Intellectual Cooperation, and the report of the Opium Committee. The Japanese representative did not attend, but several secretaries were present to listen. The public meeting lasted for three quarters of an hour. Dr. Koo endorsed the Opium Report, saying that China is determined to earnestly deal with the opium problem and the trade in dangerous narcotics. Dr. Koo proposed that methods be formulated quickly so that the government can comply with conventions to restrict the sale and manufacture of narcotics. The public meeting of the Administrative Council was then adjourned until 10:30 a.m. tomorrow morning. (Reuters dispatch, 22nd) (Geneva) The League of Nations Administrative Council meeting began secretly this morning, deciding to postpone discussion of the Assyrian massacre case at the request of the Iraqi government, and then officially opened at 11:40 a.m. With this important and difficult issue postponed, it passed several reports today on issues such as opium prohibition, international intellectual cooperation, and the establishment of the International Building Committee. Chinese representative Wellington Koo stated that China will soon join the 1931 Convention on Limiting the Manufacture and Distribution of Dangerous Drugs. The Assyrian issue is expected to be one of the most difficult issues that must be handled at this session because France accuses the Iraqi government of mistreating the Assyrians, forcing them to flee the country. So far, France and Iraq are still in dispute. It is expected that France will ask the League of Nations to pay attention to Iraq's declaration to the League of Nations on May 30, 1932, guaranteeing full protection of all ethnic groups within the country without discrimination on the basis of language, race, or religion. However, the Iraqi representative here claimed that the Iraqi government has been studying methods for implementing the League of Nations resolution on the Assyrians within the country since November of last year. The dispute between France and Iraq this time was caused by the fact that the Assyrians in Syria were not completely disarmed and could attack Iraqi sentries. (Guomin dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The League of Nations Council is scheduled to meet in Geneva on the 22nd. This meeting will discuss the report of the advisory committee established by the resolution of non-recognition of (Manchukuo) and the speech of the Chinese representative. Foreign Minister Hirota attaches importance to this matter and yesterday cabled Ito Shuji, Director of the League of Nations Imperial Affairs Bureau, and Counselor Yokoyama to rush to Geneva. (Dentsu dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Although Japan has withdrawn from the League of Nations, it will always cooperate with cultural facilities for the betterment of mankind. This is the policy of the Japanese government and has been stated repeatedly. The term of Dr. Aikitsu Tanakadate, a member of the Committee on Intellectual Cooperation, which is suitable for the League of Nations Council meeting starting on the 22nd, is about to expire and will be re-elected. The Foreign Ministry intends to recommend Dr. Inazo Nitobe as his successor. After Dr. Nitobe returns from the Banff Pacific Conference, he will be consulted. In order to dispel misunderstandings about the Japanese government after withdrawing from the League of Nations, the Foreign Ministry believes that Dr. Nitobe, a scholar with international credibility, is the most suitable candidate, so it has decided to recommend him. (Dentsu dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Amidst the most serious European political atmosphere since the end of the European War, the League of Nations Administrative Council meeting will open tomorrow. The first meeting will be a closed meeting as usual to discuss important internal administrative issues of the Council. The public meeting will be held in the afternoon to handle routine matters. The terms of Ireland and Norway as members of the current session have expired. According to the situation today, it is expected that the League of Nations General Assembly will elect Australia and Denmark to succeed them. All the more important proposals at this Administrative Council meeting will probably be discussed starting next week. Current difficult issues include the political tension between Germany and Austria. Because Britain, Italy, and other countries are very anxious about the frequent incidents on the German-Austrian border, the League of Nations will have to discuss them. Another example is the issue of Germany's treatment of Jews. It is heard that the petitions and supporting documents sent by international conferences from various places received by the League of Nations Secretariat are almost a foot high, and it will be impossible not to have a public debate on them. Furthermore, according to the situation in the lounge today, there is currently an attempt to publicly debate the current turbulent political situation in the world. League of Nations leaders believe that it is their responsibility to dispel the turbulence in the world. These issues are better handled by the League of Nations than by diplomatic talks between countries. In addition, the dispute between France and the Kingdom of Iraq over the issue of Syrian refugees also seems likely to be brought to the Administrative Council meeting. (Guomin dispatch, 21st) (Geneva) The French government sent a memorandum to the League of Nations regarding the massacre of Assyrian Christian minorities in Iraq, asking it to be distributed to all member states. The League of Nations Secretariat today specifically announced this memorandum. According to the circumstances, after the massacre of Assyrian Christians in Iraq in early August of this year, the Iraqi government involved the French government, which was mandated to govern Syria. The French government therefore presented this memorandum to clarify. The contents of the French memorandum detail the border situation, which is essential to understanding the incident, and then analyzes and explains the incident, saying (On the Syrian side, officials responsible for maintaining border order have always maintained an extremely fair attitude towards the Iraqi government. Regarding incidents occurring on the border and difficulties caused by the large number of Assyrian Christians fleeing to Syria, Syrian French officials, regardless of the size of the matter, must report to the Iraqi government on a daily basis. When the leaders of the Assyrian Christians requested entry into the Syrian border, French officials ordered them to hand over the weapons they were carrying for safekeeping, and they could not be used within the territory of Syria during their stay. At the end of July of this year, Assyrian Christians, knowing that Syria was difficult to accommodate, contacted the Iraqi authorities again to surrender. The Assyrians then informed the Syrian French officials that they had reached an agreement and were willing to return to Iraq and requested the return of their original weapons. The French authorities granted their request and returned the weapons. The Assyrians then crossed the Tigris River to the east, and gunfire broke out. At that time, Iraqi troops were setting up machine guns on the river and firing head-on. On August 8, several people transported the wounded back to the west bank of the river, and Iraqi aircraft followed and bombed them. (Havas dispatch, 21st)</p>
<h3>British Representatives Exert Themselves to Clear the Thorns of Disarmament</h3>
<p>Continuing Consultations with France, Italy, Germany, and the United States</p>
<p>(London) This afternoon, British Ambassador Sir Eric Phipps will host a banquet at his embassy to entertain British Foreign Secretary Sir John Simon, Undersecretary Anthony Eden, Lord President of the Council Baldwin, French Premier Daladier, and Foreign Minister Paul-Boncour. Sir John Simon and Anthony Eden will fly from London to here this morning, and Baldwin has already arrived here. After the banquet, Britain and France will continue to discuss the draft disarmament treaty. Then, Sir John Simon and Anthony Eden will go to Geneva to attend the League of Nations Administrative Council meeting and the League of Nations General Assembly. Daladier will probably go to Geneva on Sunday and will talk with Baldwin at the end of the week if necessary. The British representatives will consult with the representatives of France, Italy, Germany, and the United States in Geneva, hoping to clear the thorns hindering progress and make the British draft accepted by the public, so that the Disarmament Conference can be resumed in October. What is currently exciting is that the feelings between France and Italy are gradually getting closer. This is particularly relevant because the power of Italian Premier Mussolini can extend to the German government. (Reuters dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<h3>Roosevelt Considers Controlling Monetary Policy</h3>
<p>To Make the Price of the Dollar Tend Toward Stability; The Government Purchases Agricultural Products to Relief the Poor</p>
<p>(Washington) It is heard that the authorities are currently seriously considering a plan to give the managed dollar a strong purchasing power so that prices can be fixed. The President has the power to determine the gold content of the dollar for any specified period, which can be specified monthly or quarterly. (Reuters dispatch, 21st)</p>
<p>(New York) President Roosevelt's intention to implement a "managed currency" policy, seeking to keep the purchasing power of the dollar unchanged for a long time, is now becoming increasingly clear. Financial figures say that although the government has expressed opposition to a true monetary inflation policy, it is actually implementing a lending inflation policy, such as the Federal Reserve Bank purchasing government bonds and releasing loans through the Financial Rehabilitation Corporation. In addition, the government is spending huge sums of money on agriculture and public works. The government is now studying a large-scale plan to recirculate the 60 billion yuan of funds stagnating in the closed or liquidating banks. The government also intends to purchase half of the cotton harvest at a price of 15 cents per pound to satisfy cotton farmers (the current value of cotton is 10 cents per pound), provided that various cotton farmers agree to reduce the amount of the next harvest according to this number. If this plan is effective, other growers will also demand the same treatment from the government. (Havas dispatch, 21st) (Washington) Roosevelt wants to find ways to eliminate surplus agricultural products to raise prices and is studying new methods to relieve unemployment. He recently ordered the Department of Agriculture to adjust agriculture and ordered the Federal Agricultural Relief Bureau to purchase 75 million worth of beef, milk, and poultry to distribute to the poor. He also plans to purchase cotton to make clothes and provide relief to the poor. Various states and the federal government have already carried out relief efforts. In the past, 100,000 hogs were purchased from hog farmers and have begun to be distributed to the poor. The current purchase is for another batch. There are now 3.5 million people who have registered and are waiting for relief. (Havas dispatch, 21st)</p>
<h3>Pro-Inflation and Anti-Inflation Factions Clearly Defined</h3>
<p>(Washington) All the newspapers in the United States today are fighting against the pro-inflation members of Congress, while senators who do not support inflation have also gathered under Roosevelt's banner. Roosevelt knows that the pro-inflation faction in Congress will openly break with the government in January next year, but he is determined to follow the original policy, stating clearly that reducing the value of gold yuan, printing more greenbacks, and other inflation schemes are not currently in the government's plan. Senator Lewis was the first to assist the government in the battle, declaring that inflation would destroy the industrial recovery plan. However, the power of the pro-inflation faction is also very strong. The government itself has investigated the attitude of members of Congress. Those who support inflation currently constitute a majority in both houses. Only after prices, especially cotton prices, have increased significantly can the attitude of the members of Congress be changed. The southern states account for the vast majority of power in the Democratic government, and now, due to the extraordinary drop in cotton prices in the past four years, most have become pro-inflation.

<h3>The U.S. Will Propose a Monetary Treaty to Britain</h3>
<p>Seeking to Have the Gold Pound and the U.S. Dollar Join Hands</p>
<p>(New York) According to the New York Evening Post's Washington dispatch, President Roosevelt is considering the possibility of concluding a monetary treaty between Britain and the United States, stipulating the relationship between the dollar and the pound, because war debt negotiations are about to resume. President Roosevelt has discussed this matter with Professor Moley, who was on a special mission to London at the World Economic Conference, and with the well-known banker Warburg and other financial experts.

<p>Berlin, Guomin News, 22nd: German newspapers commented on the new Austrian cabinet with considerable suspicion.

<h3>Reichstag Fire Trial Begins; Main Defendant Feigns Madness in Court</h3>
<p>Reuters, Leipzig, 21st: The Dutch defendant in the Reichstag fire trial, Lubbe, appeared in court today dressed in coarse cloth, with his hands tied behind his back and iron chains around his waist, to be interrogated. At the start of the trial, the presiding judge ordered his handcuffs to be removed. Evidence was presented to show that Lubbe had been mentally abnormal since childhood and had a tendency to commit crimes. It was also shown that he had attempted to join the National Socialist Party, whose aim was to overthrow the German constitution by force. The arson was merely a minor aspect of their crimes.</p>
<p>Reuters, Leipzig, 22nd: At the start of the Reichstag fire trial yesterday, the defendant Lubbe exhibited signs of madness during questioning. A psychiatrist was summoned to examine his mental state. The psychiatrist stated that Lubbe's nerves were normal, but he could not determine whether his behavior was natural or feigned. The presiding judge stated that Lubbe's mad laughter yesterday suggested a mental illness. The psychiatrist then stated that Lubbe had gone on a hunger strike in prison to expedite the trial, and then resumed eating. During today's hearing, the police chief of Breslau stated that a "Brown Book" published on September 1, which contained accusations of National Socialist atrocities and claimed that the Reichstag fire was ordered by Hitler's propaganda minister Goebbels and that the plan was poorly executed, was entirely fabricated. The prosecutor then read a news item from a Dutch newspaper stating that prison officials had withheld a letter from Lubbe's family regarding his defense. As a result, Lubbe's family had petitioned President Hindenburg for assistance. The presiding judge asked Lubbe about the letter. Lubbe insisted that he had not received it and that it must be in prison. The court then adjourned to allow Lubbe to meet with Dutch lawyer Dr. Storm Pol, who had been hired by Lubbe's family and had flown to Leipzig to defend Lubbe.</p>

<h3>Mutiny of the Guard of the Xinjiang Governor's Office Unsuccessful</h3>
<p>Sheng Shicai Telegraphed Beijing to Report</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The guard of the Xinjiang Governor's Office, incited by others, plotted a mutiny, but it was discovered and stopped before it could cause any trouble. Sheng Shicai telegraphed a report to Beijing, the original text of which is as follows:</p>
<p>Respectfully presented to Chairman Lin of the Central Executive Committee of the National Government, Premier Wang of the Executive Yuan, the Military Affairs Commission, the General Staff Headquarters, the Ministry of Military Affairs, and Chairman Chiang in Guling: Previously, Ma Zhongying repeatedly sent his representatives Zhang Yashao and Yao Zhiping to the province to discuss seeking peace due to defeat. I, Shicai, followed the benevolent intentions of the Central Government and stopped the victorious army, refraining from pursuing the defeated enemy. I also sent the Chief of Staff of the Governor's Office, Liu Bin, to negotiate the peace. It was agreed that Ma's army would withdraw from Turpan and concentrate in Hami, and that I would appoint Ma as the East Route Garrison Commander. Politics would be subject to the Chairman, and military affairs would be subject to the Governor. Ma signed and agreed to each item. The details have been telegraphed and reported previously. However, for almost two months, Ma's army has been stationed in Turpan without any intention of withdrawing. On the 9th of this month, Minister Luo went to Turpan for inspection. Chairman Liu sent the Administrative Director, Li Rong, and I sent the Chief of Staff, Liu Bin, and my younger brother, Shiqi, to accompany him as hostages, intending to show our sincerity and invite Ma to the province for detailed discussions to seek long-term peace and stability. Unexpectedly, Ma Zhongying was suspicious and did not advance, but instead invited me and Chairman Liu to meet in Daban City. Considering that Ma Zhongying had already assumed the military position I had appointed him to, such a request was arrogant in terms of status and rank. However, in order to resolve the situation and alleviate the Central Government's concerns in the west, I and Chairman Liu decided to humble ourselves and meet him on the 16th. Unexpectedly, Yao Zhiping and others instigated a mutiny of the Governor's Office guard between the two parties. Fortunately, the officers and soldiers of the guard were not entirely deceived and reported it, so it was prevented in advance and did not cause any trouble. It is difficult to guess whether Ma instructed Yao and others to take such absurd actions. To prevent any future problems, I had to temporarily put Yao and others under surveillance. After careful consideration, I, Shicai, could not bear to lightly start a war and cause suffering to the people again. I still hope that Ma Zhongying will deeply realize the danger of the overall situation and the plight of the people's livelihoods. I have sent a letter by special envoy, asking him to send another representative to the province to continue negotiations. As long as there is a glimmer of hope for peace, I, Shicai, will do everything possible to achieve it. Further developments will be telegraphed and reported. I humbly request your review and approval. The Xinjiang Border Defense Governor, Sheng Shicai, kowtows. (Special Dispatch, 22nd)</p>

If this happens, more than 5,000 workers will lose their jobs, and indirectly more than 20,000 poor people will face starvation.

Zhang Ji and Liu Shouzhong telegraphed Liu Zhi, requesting him to send a senior official to Zhengzhou to resolve the labor-management dispute at the Yufeng Cotton Mill.

<p>A special dispatch from Peiping states that Fang Zhenwu, Ji Hongchang, Liu Guitang (including Zheng Guilin and Li Shouxin's troops), Tang Yulin, and others have new plans, intending to advance in three routes and attempt to infiltrate northern Hebei's Luan River region and eastern areas, join forces with the puppet army and bandits, and prepare for a major campaign. It is said that a certain country is behind this, providing all military expenses and weaponry from Chengde. Although Fang and his troops have begun military actions and occupied Huairou, due to the constraints of the Tanggu Truce Agreement, our side cannot dispatch troops. The situation of each party is described below:</p>
<h3>Encirclement of Huairou</h3>
<p>At 9:00 AM on the 20th, about 600 to 700 troops suddenly arrived in Huairou County, claiming to be Fang Zhenwu's forces. They set up posts inside and outside the city, only allowing merchants and civilians to leave the city but not to enter. On this day, Fang Zhenwu's forces, which had infiltrated Huairou County, had surrounded the county seat, cutting off transportation. The Public Security Bureau Chief of Gaoliying received a report in the afternoon that pedestrians could only reach Fengshankou, three miles from the city, where Fang's troops had set up posts, prohibiting passage. Fang's troops did not move south, so it is difficult to ascertain the situation inside the city. Fang Zhenwu and Ji Hongchang's troops previously fled east from Dushikou and gathered in the Fengning County area along the Rehe border, also mixed with the remnants of Zheng Guilin's troops, totaling about 5,000 or more. The day before yesterday, they infiltrated Hebei Province from Changyuankou in northern Huairou (Changyuankou is the only route between Huairou and Fengning). At 9:00 AM on the 20th, a company of cavalry from the vanguard of Fang Zhenwu's troops, about 100 or more, suddenly arrived at Huairou County. After hearing the alarm, the county government hurriedly ordered the closure of the four gates. Because Fang's cavalry moved quickly, they had not yet closed the gates. Fang's troops had already surrounded the county seat, and County Magistrate Xu Wenquan had not had time to withdraw. Transportation between Pinggu and Miyun was completely cut off after the afternoon of the 20th. According to people from Qiaozicun in Miyun, the cavalry team the day before yesterday entered Hebei Province from Fengning. Tang Yulin and Ji Hongchang's troops are also active near Changyuankou, severely checking pedestrians. Huairou is about 115 miles from northern Peiping.</p>
<h3>He and Song Confer</h3>
<p>Because a comprehensive plan for the aftermath in Chahar Province has not yet been fully agreed upon, the Chairman of Chahar Province, Song Zheyuan, has delayed his return to Chahar. After the adjournment of the regular meeting of the Peiping Military Branch on the 20th, Song again discussed with He Yingqin for a long time, until Song finally left at 1:00 PM. It is reported that the general principles for the Chahar situation have been largely agreed upon as follows: (1) Considering diplomatic relations, Fang Zhenwu and Ji Hongchang's infiltration into the Fengning area within the territory of Rehe will not be pursued for the time being. (2) National troops in eastern Chahar who have already arrived at their destinations will firmly defend their current positions and stop advancing. All other troops will temporarily suspend their departure to eastern Chahar. (3) Li Shouxin's bandit army in Guyuan has retreated to the Dolon area. All troops arriving in eastern Chahar will temporarily suspend guerrilla warfare. Chairman Chiang sent a telegram to Song, roughly stating that the Chahar region is extremely important, and Fang Zhenwu and Ji Hongchang's attitudes are ambiguous. He hopes that Song will return to Chahar as soon as possible to take charge of everything and asks for a reply regarding the date of his departure. After receiving the telegram, Song immediately replied, stating that the aftermath in Chahar is of great importance, and that he would do his best to shoulder the heavy responsibility. He has decided to depart on the afternoon of the horse day (21st) and hopes to receive instructions from time to time.</p>
<h3>Japanese Planes Fly Over Shunyi</h3>
<p>According to a telephone report from County Magistrate Su of Shunyi County Government at 11:30 AM today (21st), after Fang Zhenwu's troops occupied Huairou County on the 20th, the vanguard had only 600 to 700 people, but gradually increased, now totaling more than 2,000. After entering the city, they killed five members of the Public Security Team and confiscated all their weapons. They placed the County Magistrate, the Public Security Bureau Chief, and the Chairman of the Chamber of Commerce under surveillance, restricting their freedom. Fang himself is currently stationed in the city, and his sentries have been placed in Nan Shicao, in the sixth district of Shunyi, seemingly with intentions of moving south. The county government is currently seeking instructions on how to respond. Furthermore, at 10:00 AM on the morning of the 21st, a Japanese plane flew from the north of Shunyi over Shunyi County, conducted a reconnaissance for a week, and then flew north again. Since the establishment of the Truce Agreement, Japanese planes have not come for a long time. This time, taking advantage of Fang Zhenwu's occupation of Huairou, Japanese planes came again for reconnaissance, which must have other intentions. The Military Branch held an emergency meeting this morning (21st) and discussed this matter. In addition to ordering certain troops to monitor the situation, measures to prevent Fang's troops from moving south were discussed. They also ordered the First Department to quickly draft appropriate measures for implementation. (Jin on the 21st)</p>
<h3>The Situation of Entering the City</h3>
<p>When Fang's troops arrived in Huairou on the morning of the 20th, the vanguard had a total of 600 to 700 people. There was a company of security guards stationed in the city, only about 100 people. Because the troops arrived suddenly, fearing conflict, they tightly closed the city gates. Because Fang's troops could not enter, they surrounded the city walls on all sides. Merchants and civilians, fearing further devastation in the city, sent representatives out of the city to negotiate with Wang Zhongfu's troops of Fang's army. Fang's only goal was to enter the city. The representatives of the merchants agreed to this and hoped that they would maintain order in the city after entering. In the afternoon, the city gates were opened, and after Fang's troops entered the city, they placed County Magistrate Xu Wenquan, the Public Security Bureau Chief, and the Chairman of the Chamber of Commerce under strict surveillance. All security police were disarmed, and two or three people were shot and killed. Beforehand, Fang had reached a proper agreement with Ji, Liu, Tang, and the Japanese puppet forces. He also sent representatives to negotiate with bandit leaders in eastern Luan River, such as Lao Haozi. Liu Guitang also sent a unit to follow Fang's troops into the war zone. As of today (21st), Fang's troops have successively passed through Yong'anbao, and those moving south to Huairou have reached more than 2,000. Fang himself has also entered and stationed in Huairou City. The troops of Ji Hongchang, Tang Yulin, and Zheng Guilin are also continuing to advance. Ji's troops have also arrived at Yong'anbao.</p>
<h3>Bandit Gangs Rampage</h3>
<p>After Lao Haozi's bandit fleet occupied the Qinhuangdao area, they extorted hundreds of thousands from merchants and planned to enter the central war zone. Recently, it was reported that Fang Zhenwu's troops had entered Hebei Province and were eager to return to eastern Peiping to make contact with Fang. However, the merchants have not yet raised enough money. Lao Haozi was extremely angry and, starting on the 20th, set fire to villages, residences, and shops in the Qinhuangdao and Beidaihe area. According to those who came to Peiping on the Beining train this morning (21st), they saw smoke and fire spreading in the east when passing through Beidaihe last night, which was shocking. After burning the villages, the bandit troops planned to directly enter Sanhe and move towards Ji County. Because the war zone is a demilitarized zone as stipulated by the Tanggu Truce Agreement, the Japanese army in Rehe actually allowed Fang, Ji, and other troops to pass through and occupy the area, which is of great importance. Today (21st), a certain unit of the Ping Sui Line was ordered to monitor the edge of the war zone to prevent the situation from escalating.</p>
<h3>Negotiating Suppression</h3>
<p>At the same time, Yin Tong, a member of the Receiving Committee, negotiated with Chaisan, the Japanese military attaché stationed in Peiping, to find ways for both sides to suppress the bandit troops of Fang and others who infiltrated the war zone. Chaisan agreed and immediately telegraphed the Kwantung Army for instructions. If the other side does not have special intentions, they can agree to find a way to suppress them, and the situation may not escalate. However, the Japanese plane's reconnaissance over Shunyi today clearly shows their opinion. The Military Branch held a temporary meeting this morning (21st) and discussed this matter. In addition to ordering certain troops to monitor the situation, measures to prevent Fang's troops from moving south were discussed. They also ordered the First Department to quickly draft appropriate measures for implementation. (Jin, 21st)</p>
<h3>Case to Continue Collection of Additional Customs Duty</h3>
<p>Passed by the Legislative Yuan after Examination</p>
<p>At the general meeting of the Legislative Yuan on the morning of the 22nd, the Finance Committee reported on the examination of the case to continue collecting 5% additional customs duty, which was resolved and passed. The original presentation of the Finance Committee is recorded as follows: (Presented for reporting matters, according to the order of the Yuan, approved by the National Government Civil Service Office Letter No. 3441, transferred by the National Government Central Political Conference letter, approving the Executive Yuan's letter based on the Ministry of Finance's proposal to continue collecting 5% additional customs duty, which was submitted to the Finance Group for examination. The report stated that it is proposed to temporarily approve the extension of this additional 5% for eleven months within the 22nd year, and the amount to be collected will be included in the extraordinary budget and submitted to the government for prior implementation. When the Legislative Yuan is in session, it will be submitted for ratification. After deliberation by this conference, it was resolved to pass it according to the examination opinions and sent to the government for reference and compliance. It was ordered to forward it for compliance, etc. In addition to replying and ordering the government to order the Executive Yuan to forward it to the Ministry of Finance for compliance, etc., the original letter should be copied and sent for reference, etc. This committee complied on the 7th of this month and convened the sixth meeting of the third session to submit it for examination. It was resolved that the case of continuing to collect 5% additional customs duty has already been ordered by the government to the Executive Yuan to forward it to the Ministry of Finance for compliance. The case has been implemented first, and it is requested that the extension be approved for eleven months, with a fixed period. It is proposed to grant ratification. Is this appropriate? Please review and submit it to the general meeting for public decision.)</p>

<h3>Sun Tonggang Flies to Wuhan, Warmly Welcomed by All Sectors, Will Fly to Hunan in the Coming Days</h3>
<p>A dispatch from Hankou states that aviator Sun Tonggang, accompanied by his classmate Wang Zuwen, flew the "Aviation to Save the Nation" aircraft west from Anqing on the 21st and arrived in Wuhan at 12:30 PM, landing at the Wangjiadun airfield. About 5,000 people from various agencies, organizations, schools, and all sectors of the public welcomed them at the airfield. The enthusiastic situation was unprecedented. When Sun's plane arrived in Wuhan, it circled the three towns of Wuhan for a week. The 4th Aviation Team dispatched planes to welcome them, performing various technical demonstrations in the air for about half an hour before descending amidst cheers. After Sun and Wang got off the plane, two young female students each presented a bouquet of flowers, which Sun accepted with a smile. He then stood on the plane and gave a speech to the crowd, roughly saying: (I studied in Germany, but my accomplishments are not deep. This time, I flew back to the country to promote aviation to save the nation and arouse public attention. I am truly ashamed to receive such a warm welcome from the people. Today, I took off from Anqing and encountered many Chinese merchant ships carrying passengers. I circled the ship, and when they saw the four characters "Aviation to Save the Nation" on the plane, they all clapped and welcomed us. It can be seen that the people have awakened). After the speech, Wu Shao-shu, a member of the Municipal Party Department, gave a reply. Then, they went to the Pacific Hotel for rest. Sun also gave a speech to reporters, detailing his return from Germany, crossing the continent, and the nationwide flight. He will stay in Wuhan for three days and then go to Changsha, and then transfer to Zhumadian, Zhengzhou, Luoyang, Kaifeng, Baoding, Taiyuan, Datong, Peiping, Tianjin, Zhangjiakou and other places. Sun also said: (The motive for this flight is entirely to promote aviation to save the nation, and I am grateful for my father's earnest advice and the active urging of my classmates. The expenses are entirely self-funded. I hope the press will expand the publicity of aviation to save the nation to save the country from danger). In the afternoon, Sun visited the headquarters of the Pacification Commissioner's Office, the Provincial Government, and the Provincial and Municipal Party Departments. In the evening, he attended a banquet hosted by the Municipal Party Department. The location of the welcome meeting of all sectors was originally scheduled for the New Market, but has now been changed to the Guangming Grand Theater, scheduled to be held at 10 AM on the 22nd. According to Wang, (Sun's plane has only 80 horsepower. The planes used in our country have reached 120 horsepower, and foreigners need hundreds of horsepower to fly long distances. Now, Mr. Sun is using a plane with 80 horsepower to accomplish this unprecedented feat, and the achievements are truly amazing. Because of our relationship as classmates, I am traveling with him. Next spring, we will go to Germany together to seek further study.) (21st)</p>
<h3>Completion of Lingshan River Bridge on Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway</h3>
<p>Also Opened to Traffic on the 21st</p>
<p>The newly built Lingshan River Bridge of the Jin-Yu section of the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway is located at Jimingyan outside the South Gate of Longyou, spanning the Lingshan River, with seven spans, more than 460 feet long. The piers of the bridge are built of concrete, and the bridge beams and deck are made of steel, with a total weight of approximately 200 tons. The bridge piers and deck engineering were all contracted by the Shanghai Yangtze Construction Company. The steel materials used were specially ordered from famous German factories, with a total cost of more than 110,000 yuan. It was completed and opened to traffic on the 21st of this month. It is reported that the bridge piers are built on red soft stone 13-14 feet below the water surface, and the foundation waterproofing project was extremely difficult. The bridge deck riveting and hoisting work was completed in only one month, demonstrating the rich experience and adequate measures of the contracting company.</p>
<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>Danger at Jinshanwei Seawall</p>
<p>The Jinshanwei seawall in Punan suddenly experienced strong southeast winds and a sharp rise in sea levels around 3:00 PM on the 18th. In the evening, the wind shifted north and was also very strong. At night, the tide nearly reached the car road. A bamboo raft was washed onto the seawall surface. Fortunately, fishing boats had already docked at Qijiadun to avoid accidents. A fishing boat belonging to a certain Mr. Bei in Beiku disappeared that night, and its whereabouts are unknown. Several fishermen are missing, and their lives and deaths are uncertain. Waves have been rising and falling for days, breaking countless tree piles, and the seawall body has newly collapsed for hundreds of feet. The dangerous project at Longzhu Nunnery, which was repaired last year, has not yet been properly constructed. It is fortunate that it was not affected by the disaster this time. Speakers say that the tide is large during the minor flood season, but the current is still slow. If the winds and tides rise again in mid-August, the three counties of Songjiang, Fengxian, and Jinshan may become a swamp. Therefore, coastal residents are very worried.</p>

<h3>Suzhou Fishermen's Association Appeals for Fishmongers</h3>
<p>The Wu County Business Tax Bureau notified all fish businesses to collect business tax on behalf of the fishmongers. The fish businesses believe that the fishmongers in Wu County are all poor and have no ability to bear the business tax. Therefore, they appealed to the Wu County Fishermen's Association for relief. The association specially sent a telegram to the Suzhou Provincial Government and the Department of Finance yesterday (22nd), requesting that the bureau be ordered to stop the tax collection in order to maintain the livelihoods of the poor.</p>
<h3>Resolution of Business Tax Dispute in Changzhou</h3>
<p>Since the Wuyi Business Tax Bureau implemented the investigation in the autumn, various industries have strongly opposed the account checking. The dispute has lasted for a long time. Recently, County Magistrate Cai took the initiative to mediate, and after several consultations, there have been some signs of progress. The County Chamber of Commerce also convened a meeting of various industries yesterday and resolved the following matters: (1) The business tax of each business from the autumn of this year will be increased by 10% based on the original amount in the first half of the year. (2) The autumn taxes must be paid directly to the tax bureau by the businesses before October 5th.

<h3>Two Robber-Criminals Executed by Firing Squad</h3>

They were sentenced to death and presented to the Provincial Government for approval. County Magistrate Cai immediately sent police officers on the afternoon of the 21st to bring the two criminals to the case, verify their identities, and bind them to the Fengweidun execution ground for execution by firing squad.</p>
<h3>Repercussions of the Wuxi Lime Guild's Oppression of Members</h3>
<p>The Lime Boat Industry Guild in this county was established in 1919. Due to incompetent management and corruption, disputes have arisen repeatedly. In July of this year, the guild members Gu Rongpei and others accused the guild of coercion, extortion, and embezzlement of public funds, and reported it to the County Party Department and the County Court Procuratorate. The 88th meeting of the County Party Department resolved to revoke the guild's permit and ordered the county to dissolve it. On the morning of the 7th of this month, a lime boat belonging to guild member An Xinbao transported more than 190 loads of lime from Yixing to the county. When unloading at Dongting, guild committee member Yu Genxiang and others led a large group of people to the scene, accusing the boat of violating the guild rules and arbitrarily departing, causing a great dispute. The boat owner An Xinbao claimed that when he loaded the lime in Wuxi, he registered with the guild as required and did not violate the guild rules. Even if there was a violation of the guild rules, the industry guild had no right to seize the boat. He accused the guild of illegal behavior, resembling that of thugs, and specially submitted a petition on the guild's misdeeds and the seizure of the boat. He also attached various evidence and submitted it to Chairman Jiang of Jiangxi, the National Government of Nanjing, the Central Party Department, the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Industry, the Zhenjiang Provincial Party Department, the Provincial Government, and the County Party Department and County Government of this county, requesting relief. The original text is very long, and the main points are: (1) Listing the guild's clever establishment of names and coercion and extortion. (2) Listing the facts of embezzlement of public funds and seeking private gain and malpractice. (3) Detailing the seizure of boats, goods, and silver dollars. (4) The guild's organization fundamentally violates laws and regulations, requesting a clear investigation and disbandment. Before one wave has subsided, another has risen. Yesterday, a lime boat belonging to a non-member, Hua Yongfa, was also unloading goods outside the West Gate when guild committee member Ling Xinbao and others led a large group of people and police officers from the 4th Branch of the Public Security Bureau to seize the boat and detain the boatmen, submitting them to the County Public Security Bureau. Ling Fenghao, the executive director of the Lime Boat Guild, voluntarily turned himself in for questioning. After Wu, the section chief, opened the court for questioning, Hua Yongfa testified that he was not a member of the guild, and the guild's illegal actions were an obstruction of freedom, requesting strict punishment according to law. Ling Fenghao's testimony was evasive. The result of the court's order was that Hua Yongfa was ordered to return, Ling Fenghao was released on bail, and the lime boat was returned to Hua Yongfa. After the order was completed, Ling Fenghao found the Tang Hengtai Lime Company in the Big City Bridge to bail him out of the bureau. It was already 12:00 AM. It is now reported that Hua Yongfa has officially sued the court for obstruction of freedom.</p>
<h3>Successful Resolution of Kidnapping Case in Wangjia Village, Danyang</h3>
<p>One evening last month, several bandits armed with pistols and sharp weapons broke into the home of farmer Wang Mingdeng in Wangjia Village, in the western countryside. They searched the inner rooms extensively, but were still not satisfied. Before leaving, they kidnapped his young son and left a note demanding a huge ransom, which was not successful. Now the kidnappers in this case have been intercepted by the Inland River Patrol Fleet of the Jiangsu Provincial Police Headquarters in Wuxi. A boat was seized on the spot, and the kidnappers Tao Shaoqin, Chen Xiaolong, Chen Guangyu, and Shao Qiaoxiao were arrested and two pistols were seized. They were taken back to the headquarters for interrogation. They confessed to the kidnapping case in Danyang. Now police have been sent to escort the criminals to Danyang for trial.</p>

<h3>Statistics of Flood Losses in Chongming</h3>
<p>Chongming is surrounded by the sea on all sides, and the ground is very low. Usually, the tides are controlled by the people's dikes. The dikes along the northern coast were completely destroyed by the autumn wind last winter, causing huge losses. Unfortunately, the wind came again last night, and the northern parts of the first, second, third, fourth, fifth, and seventh districts were submerged again, and the situation was twice as severe as last winter. The repaired dikes were destroyed again, and the unrepaired ones drove straight in, causing the water to flood. The city and the sea dikes of Chenghai were damaged in more than 40 sections. Details are still under investigation due to the disruption of transportation. The County Relief Association has sent personnel to distribute relief supplies. The first statistics of the disaster are as follows: The disaster area is 695 square li, more than 200 li of dikes were destroyed, more than 6,200 houses were washed away, 208 people died, 22,165 people were affected, and 274,740 mu of farmland were affected.</p>
<h3>Director Xu of Qingjiang Leaves Pu to Return to Yang</h3>
<p>Xu Dingkang, Director of the Jiangbei Canal Engineering Bureau, previously heard frequent reports of floods and breaches of the Yellow River in Lu and Yu. He noted that the waters were flowing into the Weishan and Zhaoyang lakes at the junction of Jiangsu and Shandong and were about to flow into the Central Canal, causing a dangerous situation. He specifically telegraphed the counties in northern Jiangsu, ordering them to repair any breaches of the Central Canal, the Outer Canal, the abandoned Yellow River, and the Six Tang Dikes, and to remove any dams. He also personally led Secretary Shen Baojun and others to Huaiyin to supervise the situation and send personnel to various counties to inspect and assist in the repairs. Now that the Yellow River water has receded and the work is not as urgent as before, he specifically ordered the Huai-Pi section's engineering office to be dismantled first on the 19th. He concluded all work on that day and hired a sailboat to attach it to the back of the Xin Chun special ship before departing from Huai and returning to Yang.</p>

<h3>Thorough Investigation of Illegal Sale of Military Mountain Land in Pinghu</h3>
<p>It has been repeatedly heard that unscrupulous people from Liangzhuang and Changshan townships in Zha Pu are stealing and selling land in Baoshan. Even strategically important land is being sold to foreigners. Recently, Li Chunhe, Fang Tianfu, Fang Chunrong, and others sold the military mountain land of Yunding Mountain to a certain Westerner. The top of this mountain is flat. It is said that Emperor Qin Shihuang tested his sword there, and the mountaintop was cut off and fell into the sea. The Coffin Reef in the sea has repeatedly damaged ships, and it is said to be the top of this mountain. It is recorded in local chronicles and is considered a scenic spot. After the news of the illegal sale spread, local people requested the county government to thoroughly investigate. The county government, based on the report, secretly ordered the Zha Pu district office to arrest the perpetrators.

<h3>Major Fire at Hongsheng Warehouse in Ningbo Jiangdong</h3>
<p>At around 5:00 AM yesterday morning (the 20th), a fire broke out at the Hongsheng warehouse, No. 53, Muhang Road, Jiangdong, Ningbo, due to the Fuyang ash stored in the warehouse dissolving due to tidal water. When the Jiangdong Yilong fire brigades arrived at the scene after hearing the alarm, the fire had already broken through the roof and was impossible to approach. Furthermore, there were many oils in the warehouse, making it extremely difficult to extinguish. All the Yilong brigades from the city center were unable to pass due to the old Jiang Bridge being broken by the hurricane. Only the Laian Association and the Linan Association managed to hire boats to cross the river and assist in the firefighting. It took two hours to extinguish the fire. It is estimated that dozens of businesses, including Chengtai Jiang Youhang, were burned, with losses amounting to around 100,000 yuan. Also, at 11:00 PM last night, a fire broke out in the warehouse of the World Bookstore in Lane 44, Cuiya Street, Ningbo. It took half an hour to extinguish the fire. The books stored in the World Bookstore warehouse were worth over 10,000 yuan and were completely burned. Fortunately, there was fire insurance, so the loss was relatively small. Several other burned houses included the Shirui Ji Cloth Store, with significant losses.</p>
<h3>Gradually Eliminating Opium and Banditry in Huizhou</h3>
<p>The Huizhou region of southern Anhui borders Jiangxi Province, and the area of Wuyuan County, which belongs to Huizhou, was partially occupied by bandits and communists. After Chairman Jiang of the Military Affairs Commission designated it as the Tenth District of Anhui and dispatched Administrative Inspector and Commander Liu Cheng粹 to lead troops to suppress them, the bandits were driven back. However, scattered bandits hid within the territory, taking advantage of the situation to kidnap, rob, and sell opium, acting sporadically. The remaining evils were quite rampant, and the people of Huizhou suffered greatly. Commissioner Liu, on the one hand, vigorously implemented the autonomous system, established Baojia (household registration) and trained local militia to cut off the bandits' trails. On the other hand, he secretly deployed detectives, arresting and executing the notorious bandit leaders and master criminals involved in the production and sale of red pills (opium pills). Currently, opium rehabilitation centers, unemployment relief centers, beggar education centers, and national goods promotion venues are being established in various counties to provide outlets for those addicted to opium and the unemployed, while also employing veteran scholars and celebrities to lecture everywhere to influence people's hearts. Deputy Security Commander Wang Han is brave and resolute, providing effective assistance. Therefore, the scourge of opium and banditry in Huizhou has gradually been eliminated, and the people of Huizhou can breathe a sigh of relief for a while. The local legal entities and gentry of each county have separately submitted requests to the Military Affairs Commission, the Administrative Council, the Provincial Government, and the Government of Anhui for recognition of Liu and Wang.</p>

<h3>Mayor Wu Personally Inspected Wind-Damaged Seawalls Yesterday</h3>
<p>The West Seawall is Nearing Completion, While the East Seawall Remains at Risk</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, during the two recent typhoons that hit this city, they coincided with high tides, causing raging winds and flooding, which surged ashore, damaging the seawalls, destroying crops, and causing significant losses. Various districts have successively requested relief. The Municipal Bureau of Public Works immediately dispatched personnel to repair the seawalls day and night. The West Seawall will be completed today, while the East Seawall remains at risk. Regarding the disaster-stricken areas, the Municipal Government has ordered the three bureaus of Social Affairs, Land, and Finance to quickly devise relief measures. Yesterday morning, Mayor Wu Tiecheng, accompanied by Shen Yi, Director of the Bureau of Public Works, and others, personally inspected the situation and provided instructions. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>The East Seawall Remains at Risk, While Repairs to the West Seawall are Nearing Completion</h3>
<p>Since the first typhoon struck this city on September 1st, many seawalls have been damaged, and the work of emergency repairs has not yet been completed. The second typhoon and rainstorm struck Shanghai again on September 18th, causing the repair work to be damaged again. The breaches caused by the first typhoon have increased. According to Dai Erjing, the chief of the Seawall Section of the Municipal Bureau of Public Works, the East Seawall (the coastal area of Gaoqiao District) was more severely damaged than the West Seawall (the Baoshan-Wusong area). The West Seawall was damaged at Wumufeng, with a breach of 14 feet in length and eight layers of stone slabs washed away. That section of the seawall is entirely stone, making the construction relatively solid, with wooden piles on the outside. The dangerous situation is less severe than that of the East Seawall. After the danger occurred, the Bureau of Public Works immediately hired workers to repair the breaches to prevent further disasters. The repair work can be completed tomorrow (i.e., today). The East Seawall (the coastal area of Gaoqiao District) is entirely earthen. When the first typhoon struck Shanghai, the seawall was damaged for five kilometers, including Moan, Zhangjiazhai, Qijiacun, Tangjiaci, Longwangmiao, and Yangjiazhai. According to statistics, the repair work required more than 600,000 English feet. After the Bureau inspected the situation, it invited bids, and the Xiehe Company was contracted to build it. Before the construction had been underway for long, the second typhoon struck again, destroying eight or nine tenths of the built work. The damaged seawall was even more severely damaged two days after being attacked by the wind and waves. After the second typhoon, the Bureau immediately dispatched personnel to hire workers to repair the breaches. At that time, because both the outside and inside of the dike were flooded, there was no way to obtain soil, and it was impossible to proceed for a while. Therefore, they are currently trying to pump out the accumulated water inside the dike. The Xiehe Company has already dispatched an additional 400 workers to assist in the rescue. The Municipal Government has allocated 50,000 yuan for emergency rescue funds. It is estimated that the entire repair project will require more than 500,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Significant Damage to Farmland, the Municipal Government is Seeking Relief</h3>
<p>The reporter inquired with villagers in various disaster-stricken areas. According to them, all the villagers along the seawall were most severely affected because they had not prepared in advance and were not able to obtain timely relief afterward. The residents' houses were almost entirely washed down by the seawater, and livestock were also harmed, which was heartbreaking to see. According to experienced farmers, this year's cotton crop, although not very abundant, was expected to yield 100 catties per acre. After this disaster, seventy or eighty percent of the crop was lost. The rice crop was expected to yield more than 500 catties, but now forty or fifty percent of the crop has been lost. Therefore, the losses incurred this time are truly staggering. After receiving reports that a typhoon was coming to Shanghai, the Municipal Government immediately ordered the relevant bureaus to prepare for emergency repairs and provide relief. Currently, disaster-stricken areas such as Wusong, Yinxiang, and Gaoqiao have successively submitted reports to the Municipal Government requesting prompt relief. The Municipal Government immediately transferred the matter to the Land, Finance, and Social Affairs Bureaus to jointly discuss relief measures. The measures will be divided into two types: emergency relief and gradual relief. The bureaus have sent personnel to the disaster-stricken areas to conduct on-the-spot inspections and provide emergency relief at any time and place. As for gradual relief measures, such as exempting land taxes or providing disaster relief loans, the bureaus will discuss them before submitting them to the Municipal Government for approval.</p>
<h3>Mayor Wu Went to Wusong Yesterday to Inspect Seawall Construction</h3>
<p>Mayor Wu paid unusual attention to the seawalls of the city, which related to the life and property of the entire city. He went to Wusong yesterday morning at 9 a.m. with Director of the Bureau of Public Works Shen Yi, Secretary of the Municipal Government Zhang Tingrong, Chief of the First Section Li Dachao, Chief Xu of the Second Section of the Bureau of Public Works, Chief Dai Erjing of the Seawall Section, and others to inspect the seawalls and direct and supervise the repairs. The visit lasted about three hours. On the way back, he went to the central area of the city for inspections. Only after 1 p.m. he returned to the Municipal Government in Fenglinqiao for a rest.</p>

<h3>The Ministry of Industry and Commerce Convenes the National Production Conference</h3>
<p>The Opening Cannot Be Held on October 1st</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, news of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce convening the National Production Conference has been frequently reported in Nanjing and Shanghai. It was set to be held in Shanghai on October 1st. However, according to information obtained by the Central News Agency reporter, various factories in Shanghai, aware of the backwardness of domestic production, which is worsening year by year, believe that if measures are not taken to save it, the future will be dire. Therefore, they have requested the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to quickly convene the National Production Conference. Chen Gongbo, the Minister of Industry and Commerce, also realized that saving the backward production was urgent, so he invited representatives from factories in Shanghai to the Ministry to discuss and decided to convene the National Factory Representatives Conference in the short term. However, the date and location have not been decided, as considerable time is still needed for preparation. It is not confirmed that the opening will be on October 1st.</p>
<h3>Third Anniversary of Tan Yankai's Death</h3>
<p>All Institutions in This City Fly Flags at Half-Mast in Mourning</p>
<p>Yesterday was the third anniversary of the death of the late President of the Executive Yuan, Tan Yankai. All institutions affiliated with the Municipal Party Headquarters and the Municipal Government flew flags at half-mast to express mourning.</p>
<h3>Mayor Wu Inspects Police This Morning</h3>
<p>Participating in the Inspection are More than 1,800 Troops at the Nanshi Public Gymnasium at 9:00 AM</p>
<p>Wen Hongen, the Director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, in order to implement the police training program and rectify discipline, had originally planned to invite Mayor Wu to inspect the city's police on the 20th. However, due to rain and muddy grounds, it was inconvenient to drill, so it was postponed. It is now known that the Bureau has scheduled the inspection for 9:00 AM this morning at the Nanshi Daji Road Public Gymnasium. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Inspection Procedure</h3>
<p>The inspection procedure is as follows: (1) Speech; (2) Parade; (3) Pass in Review; (4) Company Formation Drill; (5) Platoon Combat Drill; (6) Machine Gun Company Formation Drill; (7) Broadsword Exercise; (8) Boxing Exercise; (9) Photography; (10) Conclusion.</p>
<h3>Participating Troops</h3>
<p>Participating in the inspection are armed police officers and police detachments, companies, platoons, machine gun squads, patrol squads, and military bands from the Nanshi, Zhabei, Pudong, and Huxi District Headquarters, and the 32 sub-stations, a total of more than 1,800 people. They are jointly formed into the Second, Third, and Fourth Battalions, with Hong Liang as the General Commander, Li Beiwu as the Deputy Commander, and Fu Zhenbei, Niu Yunfang, and Pei Dawu as the Battalion Commanders of the Second, Third, and Fourth Battalions. Twelve supervising officers serve as the Company Commanders of the Second, Third, and Fourth Battalions.</p>
<h3>Invitations to Attend</h3>
<p>In addition to inviting Mayor Wu to attend the inspection and give a speech, Director of the Public Security Bureau Wen Hongen also sent invitations to Acting Songhu Garrison Commander Zhang Xiang, Security Director Yang Hu, the directors of various bureaus of the Municipal Government, representatives from various institutions, and Chinese and foreign guests to attend. The security of the venue will be handled by Captain Lu Ying of the Detective Squad, leading a large number of detectives, and District Chief Li of the Second District, dispatching police officers to maintain order around the venue.</p>
<h3>Du Yong and Others Telegraphically Request Relief for the Fishing Industry</h3>
<p>Adding a Special Project to the Economic Commission</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, Du Yong and 28 other fishermen and aquatic researchers from various provinces, including Shanghai, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Shandong, Hebei, Guangdong, and Fujian, telegraphed the Central Government yesterday, requesting that measures be taken to relieve fishing villages and that a special project for relieving the fishing industry be added to the National Economic Commission. The original telegram is recorded as follows: Nanjing: Sent to the Standing Committee of the Central Party Headquarters, the Central Political Conference, Chairman Lin of the National Government, President Wang of the Executive Yuan, President Sun of the Legislative Yuan, the Military Affairs Commission (transferred to Commander Jiang in Jiujiang), Minister Song of the Ministry of Finance, Minister Chen of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, the National Economic Commission, the Construction Commission, the Rural Reconstruction Committee, and all concerned: Fishing villages in our country account for a large proportion of rural areas in coastal provinces. In recent years, they have been on the verge of bankruptcy, with fishing grounds being oppressed by Japanese ships and fishermen turning to banditry. The aquaculture industry in freshwater areas is also an important sideline for rural areas. Without measures to relieve them, it is insufficient to seek revitalization. It is hoped that the Central Government will select and employ fishery experts to join committees such as the Rural Reconstruction Committee or establish a national fishery improvement committee to control the entire country, and add a special project for relieving the fishing industry to the National Economic Commission to carefully formulate plans, determine funding, and implement revitalization. We respectfully request your approval to comfort the people. Shanghai: Du Yong, Lin Kanghou, Fang Jiaobo, Chen Chunshou, Wang Defa; Jiangsu: Hou Chaohai, Wang Wentai, Feng Limin, Chen Hanyu, Zhang Guizun, Qian Cangshuo, Wang Jue; Zhejiang: Wu Zhenbi, Zhang Chuanbao, Hu Juntong, Jin Shao, Chen Moulang; Hebei: Zhang Yuandi, Zheng Zichen, Liu Lun; Guangdong: Chen Tongbai, Bao Yingzhong, Huang Zhengyan, Zeng Guangqing; Fujian: Wu Yi, Zhang Rongchang, Cheng Yiyue, Zhang Huihuang; Shandong: Li Anren. Together, we respectfully present this petition.</p>
<h3>Investigating and Explaining the Reasons for the Tide Surging Ashore</h3>
<p>Surging ashore is Due to the Gradual Silting Up of the Yangtze River Estuary, Which Will Require a New Channel, Causing the River Water to Back Up into the Huangpu River. Yesterday, the reporter questioned Charlie, the Chief Engineer of the Huangpu River Dredging Bureau. According to him, the silting up of the Yangtze River Estuary will certainly raise the water level. However, if this were the only result, the residents of Shanghai would need to raise the roads and foundations of their houses by one or two feet in about two hundred years. The recent surges ashore were entirely caused by the coincidence of the typhoon and high tides. Although the water level of the Yangtze River Estuary is often two or three feet higher in the summer and autumn than in the winter and spring, the impact is minimal, and Shanghai will not often experience surges ashore.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Replies to the Two Associations on Returning Donation Receipts</h3>
<p>The Party and Government Institutions Have Approved the Method and Should Request Various Groups to Handle the Matter Themselves</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday sent a letter to the Northeastern Volunteer Army Support Association and the Former Shanghai Local Maintenance Association, stating, "Regarding the unanimous demand from public opinion in this city to investigate the national salvation donations collected by various organizations, this Chamber of Commerce proposed that the Party and government institutions, which were not involved in the collection of funds, should dispatch personnel to thoroughly investigate the matter to demonstrate seriousness. We submitted reports to the Municipal Government and the Municipal Party Headquarters for approval and inquired with your Association for your opinions. We received a reply that the account books and receipts would be sent to our Chamber first. However, after reviewing this case, our Chamber first received instructions from the Municipal Government stating that it had ordered the Bureau of Social Affairs to investigate and handle the matter. Today, we also saw a report stating that the Municipal Party Headquarters' Notice No. 92 stated that all national salvation organizations should send the accounts and receipts of the donations they handled to the Shanghai All-Circles National Salvation Donation Investigation Committee for review within one week. As the method has been approved and the deadline is limited, the 50th Standing Committee Meeting of our Chamber decided to return the sent receipts to the various national salvation organizations and ask them to handle the matter themselves, without our Chamber transferring them, to comply with the regulations. The receipts that have not been sent to our Chamber will also be replied to in this manner. Accordingly, the receipt books and records are sent back with this letter. Please take note."</p>
<p>The Japanese Ship Changchun Maru</p>
<h3>Collision with the Tunan Ship Undergoing Arbitration</h3>
<p>The Board of Directors Has Submitted a Request to the Ministry to Establish an Arbitration Tribunal to Impartially Arbitrate</p>
<p>After the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Tunan ship was sunk by the Changchun Maru, the Japanese ignored the matter, and the Maritime Court in Dalian even announced that the sinking of the Tunan ship was not the fault of the Japanese ship. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company believes that this case has been delayed for a long time, and the Japanese have adopted a policy of ignoring it, resulting in huge losses for the company. After consultation, it was decided to submit a request to the Ministry to submit the Tunan case to arbitration to clarify responsibilities and seek a solution. The company's memorial requesting arbitration has been submitted to the Ministry by the Board of Directors. The details of the case are as follows:</p>
<h3>Unilateral Judgment by the Japanese Side</h3>
<p>The Dalian Maritime Court has now announced that after the trial of the collision between the Changchun Maru and the Tunan ship, the fault was not with the Japanese ship. This ruling has been notified to the Dalian Shipping Company. However, the Maritime Court rashly announced a judgment based on a unilateral request, which is not legal or reasonable in fact and naturally has no effect.</p>
<h3>Repeated Negotiations Ineffective</h3>
<p>After the Tunan ship sank, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company investigated the truth of the case. After a detailed investigation, it was determined that the fault lay with the Japanese ship Changchun Maru, and conclusive evidence was obtained. The company sent a letter to the Dalian Shipping Company based on the facts and reasons for serious negotiations, but the Japanese ignored the letter several times. The bow of the Changchun Maru that was damaged in the collision has now been repaired, renamed the Qingdao Maru, and continues to operate between Dalian, Qingdao, and Shanghai as usual. Recently, it has used the unilateral judgment of the Dalian Maritime Bureau as an excuse to disregard the serious responsibilities of sinking the Tunan ship, including the deaths of crew and passengers and the loss of cargo.</p>
<h3>Submitting a Request for Arbitration</h3>
<p>General Manager Liu Hongsheng has reported the process of this case to the Board of Directors, requesting that this case be submitted to arbitration. The Board of Directors passed the resolution and immediately submitted a memorial to the Ministry, stating, "The case of the Tunan ship being sunk by the Changchun Maru off Chengshanjiao, Shandong, has been thoroughly investigated by our company, and the responsibility for the accident should be attributed to the Japanese ship. However, the shipping company has ignored our company's repeated negotiations. If we file a lawsuit with the court, not only is there a jurisdictional issue, but also the precedent of the Japanese mail ship Ryuno Maru sinking the Xinkang ship was ignored, making it difficult to handle the matter through legal means. If we file a lawsuit in the Japanese court, it would be even more difficult to achieve a satisfactory result due to geographic and political constraints. The only option is to conduct arbitration, hire impartial personnel, and impartially arbitrate to ensure that the responsible party bears full responsibility and that losses are compensated. This memorial has been sent to the Ministry and will be processed upon approval."</p>
<h3>Planned to be Conducted in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Regarding the progress of the arbitration, the reporter inquired with Qian of the company. It is likely that an arbitration committee will be established in Shanghai, with experts in navigation and impartial individuals hired by both the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and the Dalian Shipping Company to form an arbitration tribunal. However, neither the Chinese nor Japanese sides may add members to the committee to ensure impartiality. The arbitration tribunal will summon the shipowners and crew of both parties, conduct an impartial inquiry, and determine the responsibility for the case. The company will send a letter to the Dalian Shipping Company to jointly discuss hiring experts and negotiate the number of members of the arbitration committee after the Ministry's approval is received, and then transfer the entire case to the arbitration tribunal for arbitration.</p>
<h3>French Female Aviator Scheduled to Fly to China</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, according to the French Consulate, French female aviator Ms. Schitz is scheduled to depart from Paris, France, on the 28th of this month with a pilot, passing through the Russian territory of Vladivostok to Shanghai. It is also learned that after arriving in Shanghai, she will fly to Dongping and other places before returning to her country.</p>
<h3>Lin Wo Returns to Shanghai from Hangzhou Yesterday</h3>
<p>Lin Wo, the Secretary-General of the Chinese Aeronautics Association, was dispatched to Hangzhou to attend the naming ceremony of the "Zhejiang National Salvation" aircraft held in Jianqiao on the 21st and returned to Shanghai yesterday after completing his official duties.</p>
<h3>Mrs. Jiang Zuobin Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>Jiang Zuobin, the Ambassador to Japan, has been ordered by the Central Government to return to his post at the beginning of next month. It is learned that Mrs. Jiang arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning from Nanjing by night train. It is said that Ambassador Jiang will come to Shanghai as soon as he completes his mission in Nanjing, prepare everything, and wait for the ship to depart for Japan.</p>
<h3>Red Swastika Society</h3>
<p>Report on the Disaster Relief Team's Relief Work in Changzhou and Taicang</p>
<p>The Red Swastika Societies of Wuxi, Changzhou, and Taicang formed a disaster relief team due to the severe Yellow River flood and went to Jinan for treatment. Shi Xiding, He Xixiang, and Shen Huizhi were appointed to take 21,500 yuan and lead laborers to Jinan to discuss disaster relief measures. Yesterday, the Shanghai General Office of the World Red Swastika Society's Southeast China Main Branch received reports from the Changzhou-Taicang Relief Team, which are excerpted as follows: "Respectfully, Xiding and others arrived in Jinan last night. The association provided warm hospitality and met with President He Supu, discussing the disaster situation in the four provinces. More than a dozen disaster relief teams from the General Association, Jinan Association, Qingdao Association, and Yantai Association have been dispatched in batches to various provinces to rescue the disaster victims. The severely affected areas of Shandong Province, in addition to Heze, also include Cao County, Dingtao, Dongmu, and Dong'a. After convening a meeting, it was decided to publicly recommend Mr. Jiang Baoyuan to depart for Cao County first with our team to investigate and provide relief. Then, we will proceed from Cao to Ding, and from Ding to Henan. After the meeting, we took the train to Xuzhou on the evening of the first day. The Xuzhou Association also sent three laborers to accompany us and provide assistance. On the morning of the 2nd, we transferred from Xuzhou to the Longhai Railway and set off. At 3:00 PM, we arrived at the Liuhe Station. The magistrate of Cao County sent a team to welcome us at the station. From there to Cao, there were still 73 li. It was already late at night when we arrived at Cao City. The magistrate of Cao County and representatives from various institutions came out of the city to greet us. We are currently staying in the county government to negotiate and learned that the disaster situation here is more severe in the northwest. We will begin the investigation starting from the 3rd."</p>
<h3>Regulations on Rotating Visits to the National Products Exhibition by Various Sectors</h3>
<p>In order to popularize the national products promotion campaign, the Municipal National Products Exhibition has designated Mondays and Tuesdays as public visiting days and Sundays as workers' visiting days starting from the 25th of this month. Yesterday, it sent letters to the United Association of Citizens of the First and Second Special Zones, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Party and government institutions, the General Labor Union, and other institutions, requesting them to distribute notices to their members as soon as possible and ask them to visit on schedule. The total sales volume of the exhibition venue yesterday was more than 11,800 yuan. Visitors who purchased national products for one yuan or more were given a complimentary entertainment ticket, which could be used at the exhibition. At 11:30 AM yesterday, the association specially invited Lu Wenshao, an executive member of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, to broadcast a speech titled "The Way Out for the Chinese Nation" on the Greater China Radio Station.</p>

<h3>National Federation of Commerce Cables Legislative Yuan to Request Prompt Amendment of Civil Code Partnership Articles</h3>
<p>Expedite Responsible Parties to Address Numerous Abuses, Hoping for Swift Remediation to Maintain Commerce</p>
<p>The National Federation of Chambers of Commerce yesterday cabled the Legislative Yuan, again requesting the amendment of Article 681 of the Civil Code, stating: "It is noted that during the National Industry and Commerce Conference in the 19th year of the Republic, our Federation, citing the Civil Code's provisions on partnership business and the attendant responsibility issues, which were causing obstacles, earnestly requested that supplementary articles be deliberated and submitted to the Legislative Yuan for remedy. The proposal was submitted to the Industry and Commerce Conference, and Representative Li Kuan was tasked with presenting it to the conference for review. It was deemed valid and included as Case No. 81, submitted to the conference for discussion. After Li Kuan reported on the reasons and methods for the case, Chairman Kong Xiangxi solemnly reported, stating, 'As chairman, I have previously argued vehemently against joint liability during political and state council meetings, but did not receive support due to the lack of agreement at the time. This conference consists of national industry and commerce leaders and experts discussing the direction of industry and commerce. Since Sichuan has this proposition, and the situation is similar in other regions, let us discuss it thoroughly and submit it to the government for amendment or supplementation.' Member Pan Xulun also stated that joint liability hinders business, citing the closure of Shanghai money houses as an example, and requested supplementary unlimited liability companies for relief. Member Zhang Xiangshi also seconded the motion. Chairman Kong proposed that the case regarding unlimited liability companies be forwarded to the Legislative Yuan through the Ministry of Industry and Commerce for consideration. A majority voted in favor of the proposal. Last year, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce noted that partnership is the most common form of business organization in our country, apart from sole proprietorships. Recently, with the power of the Mixed Court in foreign hands, Chinese-foreign litigation cases have led to joint liability being imposed on partnership debts, causing great uproar and years of dispute. Consequently, those with ample capital have hesitated to invest. The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce then requested that your esteemed court amend the legal precedents for joint liability in partnership debts. However, the amendment of Article 681 of the Civil Code and the supplementary addition of articles on unlimited liability companies have not yet been promulgated. Public sentiment is eagerly awaiting this. In recent years, commerce in various regions has continued to decline, largely because those with some capital are wary of partnerships, fearing potential bankruptcy and ruin. Consequently, existing businesses are gradually closing, and new businesses are rare. In this time of commercial decline, things are becoming even more desolate, with the situation worsening daily. Unless promptly remedied, the consequences are dire. Joint liability has many drawbacks, and adding unlimited liability companies is essential. This type of company involves unlimited liability based on shares, which aligns well with the actual practices and customs in Chongqing and other regions. We earnestly request that supplementary articles be added to the current Civil Code's debt section, stipulating that in partnership businesses with unlimited liability based on shares, if the partnership assets are insufficient to settle partnership debts, each partner shall bear responsibility for the shortfall proportionally according to their shares. This would help to remedy the commercial situation. In addition to recommending several executive committee members, including Li Kuan, the former representative to the National Industry and Commerce Conference, to directly submit the request, we are also requesting your esteemed association to forward the amendment. Respectfully, the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce.</p>
<h3>News from Chongming and Chuansha on Disaster Relief</h3>
<h3>Chuansha</h3>
<p>A storm surge on Hengsha Island, Chuansha County, caused a disaster, with people and livestock swept away. Approximately two thousand households and seven thousand people were affected. The situation is extremely dire. County Magistrate Li, together with local gentry Huang Renzhi, Zhang Bochu, and Lu Wenmei, organized a disaster relief association, establishing thirty fundraising teams to solicit donations from all sides. The team leaders are working diligently, and philanthropists are generously contributing. In recent days, the association has dispatched personnel with one thousand silver dollars and several hundred piculs of rice and wheat to the disaster area for emergency relief, and purchased over thirty thousand catties of rice straw to distribute to affected households for building temporary shelters. The Standing Committee of the association decided to advance five thousand yuan to County Magistrate and Lu Wenmei to urgently produce five thousand sets of cotton clothing to send to the disaster area for the victims to keep warm. The priest of the Tangmuqiao Catholic Church in the county donated one hundred piculs each of white rice and rice to send to the disaster area for emergency relief. Charitable organizations such as the Shanghai Jisheng Association are sending personnel to investigate the dire situation in the disaster area and will likely provide large-scale relief in the future. However, while the victims' basic needs of food and shelter can be temporarily met, it is merely a drop in the bucket. It is hoped that major philanthropists will continue to provide assistance.</p>
<h3>Chongming</h3>
<p>At six o'clock last night, Chongming gentry Wang Dankui and Chen Ganqing, along with Shanghai natives Lu Wanfu and Wu Bokang, and County Magistrate Shen Jiang, Water Police Captain Long Jinqin, Party Department Supervisor Chen Tiyun, and Property Department Director Tao Zhu, who came to Shanghai to solicit relief, gathered at the Shipping Club on Guangdong Road to discuss relief measures. As a result, fellow villagers in Shanghai first provided five thousand yuan to purchase food and send it to Chongming for emergency relief within two or three days. County Magistrate Shen also solicited donations from major charities and charitable organizations in Shanghai. The Chinese and Foreign Relief Association, in view of the severe rainstorms, hurricanes, and tidal surges that caused the breaches of dikes and embankments, causing widespread flooding, has already dispatched personnel to Chuansha for emergency relief. The Chongming area is also being surveyed on the ground. However, before one wave subsides, another rises. The second typhoon has caused even more severe damage. The reports received are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Urgent Telegram</h3>
<p>County Magistrate Li telegraphed: "The second typhoon has caused countless houses in the disaster area to be swept away. Over ten thousand victims are desperately awaiting relief and are on the verge of death. Please expedite emergency relief to save lives."</p>
<h3>Appeal</h3>
<p>A public letter from the Shanghai Fellow Villagers Association of Tongzhou, Rugao, Chongming, Hai'an, and Qidong states: "Earlier this month, the typhoon struck, and Qidong, located at the confluence of the river and the sea, suffered particularly severely. Many breaches were caused by huge waves along the northeastern coast and southeastern riverbanks of the county. Seawater poured in, flooding the plains to a depth of several feet, turning them into a marsh. Rice fields were submerged, and the autumn harvest is hopeless. Homes were swept away, and people and livestock were drowned. It is heartbreaking to witness. As the autumn wind intensifies, the victims have no homes to return to and are sleeping in the fields, suffering from hunger and cold. We urgently request that personnel be dispatched to provide emergency relief so that the survivors can return to their homes."</p>
<p>It is reported that representatives from the disaster areas of Chuansha, Chongming, and Nanhui went to solicit relief, and people from the provinces affected by the Yellow River also came to report the disaster situation. How different is it from the scene on the Shanyin Road? Alas, fundraising is difficult, and there are too many demands. It is urgently requested that all sectors show compassion and provide assistance to alleviate this great calamity.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Silk Industry Association Cables Opposition to Autumn Cocoon Tax</h3>
<p>Telegraphic Request to Zhejiang Finance Department to Withdraw Order</p>
<p>The Zhejiang Silk Industry Association Joint Association, located in Lianzhu Lane, Aiwenyi Road, this city, yesterday sent a telegram on behalf of the Zhejiang Finance Department, stating that the Hangzhou Zhejiang Provincial Finance Department has received a letter from the silk industry associations of Hangzhou, Wuxing, Jiaxing and other counties, stating that the order to collect cocoon tax and issue permits for the autumn cocoon collection period is impossible to comply with, and requesting an appeal for relief. The function period for the Zhejiang silk industry dental posts is specified as one year, and new posts must be paid for and replaced before the end of April each year. The silk market validity of the cocoon posts on the back covers includes spring, summer, and autumn cocoons. All previous sessions have been processed accordingly. This year, the Construction Department promulgated measures for the management of autumn cocoon industries, prohibiting industry owners from freely renting out, and all industries are under the control of official departments. Industry owners only charge agency baking fees and do not take commissions. Since it is not an operational nature, how can they be held responsible for receiving posts? Moreover, this post donation conflicts with the cocoon industry business tax rate. Now, changing the annual replacement to quarterly replacement is not only unaffordable for the cocoon industry, but also damages the credibility of government orders. The association is a group of silk merchants from the entire province, and should act as a channel. We implore Your Department to quickly withdraw the order to re-impose posts on autumn cocoons, so as to comply with public opinion. Respectfully, Zhejiang Silk Industry Association Joint Association.</p>
<h3>21st Year Silk Industry Public Bonds will be Drawn for Redemption Today</h3>

<h3>Customs to Use New Weighing Instruments from February 1st Next Year</h3>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce previously presented to the Ministry of Finance and Industry and the Customs Administration that the Customs still uses the pound scale system for foreign trade, which hinders the implementation of the new system of weights and measures, and requested that the Customs Administration order the Customs to uniformly use the new system. It has been recorded in previous reports. It is now learned that the Customs Administration has replied to the Chamber of Commerce yesterday, and the original text is recorded below: To the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce: Thank you for your telegram. The Customs Administration has received instructions from the Ministry to prepare within a limited time frame to implement the new system of weights and measures in all customs nationwide starting on February 1st of the 22nd year. At that time, this Szema scale will be abolished. This is a special reply, and I hope you will check and inform. Sealed by the Customs Administration.</p>

<h3>Mu Ouchu Discusses Planned Economy and China</h3>
<p>The issue of planned economy is needed in this day and age, and is of extreme importance to China today. The lecture by Wu Daquan at the Banking Association has been recorded in yesterday's newspaper. Now, we will seek to record the article (Planned Economy and China) written by Mu Jichu for the people to study.</p>
<p>After the European War, the world economy formed two systems: one is the capitalist economic system, and the other is the socialist economic system. These two economic systems, regardless of their fundamental differences in nature, both tend towards a planned economy. This is an inevitable requirement of history and the times, brewing into the surging new tide of today's era, and is unstoppable. The so-called planned economy, in a nutshell, is the planned control of economic activities of a certain large unit. In socialist countries, it is called (planned economy), while in European and American countries, it is commonly referred to as (planned economy). The term control does not mean arbitrary management and distribution according to private opinions, but a fair, organized, planned, and rational control and command. Its purpose is to improve the economic organization and improve the national economy and people's livelihood. Locke said, (Planned economy is to limit the economic activities of the people and groups to form the scope of action prescribed by the group, and this scope of action is rationally divided, such as cutting and pasting parts into a harmonious whole to achieve the universal social purpose assumed by reason). Lorwin also said, (Planned economy is a system of economic organization in which each individual workshop, enterprise, and industry is regarded as a coordinated unit in a whole, so as to use all available capital to maximize the satisfaction of the needs of a nation during a certain period, and its most important point is that each production unit must rely on this entire system to balance production and consumption). The opposite of planned economy is the economy of laissez-faire competition. The economy of laissez-faire competition has indeed pushed the capitalist economy to the extreme, but today, it is full of drawbacks, and has become the cause of the entire world's increasing decline. The reason is that within the economic scope of laissez-faire competition, whether it is industrial or agricultural production, it is all unplanned production, and it does not seek to be compatible with consumption. Therefore, the significance of planned economy is to evolve the economy of laissez-faire into the economy of controlled economy, and to evolve the economy of free competition into the economy of coordinated action. Today, all countries in the world are vigorously implementing the planned economy movement. Because the current world economic panic is deep, the powers are all working hard to seek to relieve the current predicament. Therefore, politically, they are mostly returning to dictatorship, and economically, they are also moving towards a self-sufficient economic nationalism. The economy of free competition has already shown many flaws, and the planned economy will inevitably replace it. As for the methods of planned economy, they are roughly three categories: one is to exercise the power of strong rule, to take all industries as state-owned, to control the entire economy with the power of the state, and to promote all economic activities with planned action. This is typified by the Soviet Union's planned economy. The second is industrial union, that is, individual entrepreneurs, feeling the pressure of the environment, control the production business of each department separately in a united manner, and make planned activities, and even force entrepreneurs and employees to form an industrial group together to form a social group. The lower level is subject to the full control and domination of the upper level. This method is actually a kind of (cartel) or (trust) internal rationalization movement, and its shortcomings are numerous, and it cannot be regarded as a pure planned economic movement. The third is that the government uses its political management power to make planned control of the people's economic activities. This is different from the Soviet Union's revolutionary method, and it is stronger and more effective than the industrial union method. Therefore, this method is mostly adopted by European and American powers. Germany, France, England, Italy, and Japan all take this method as the principle, and seek to open up the economic panic. That is, the economic recovery movement of the current US President Roosevelt is also based on this as its backbone. Not only that, but today's planned economy movement has evolved into an economic alliance of several countries or a certain federation, such as the British Empire, the American Federation, and Germany are all gatherings, and their federations implement planned economy to form a strong and powerful economic alliance. The famous Ottawa Conference of the British Empire is a clear example. Secondly, Japan (Manchukuo) also has the brewing of the so-called economic alliance. Here, we can all know how the powers are now concentrating all their efforts to seek the opening of the difficult situation of the increasingly serious economic panic. At the same time, we can also know that in today's country, if it cannot implement a planned economy, then its national economy will fall into a state of disorder and cannot be shaken off. It is simply impossible to be listed as a member of the world economy. My country's national economy today is on the verge of total bankruptcy. In terms of industry, all industrial sectors are dying. In terms of agriculture, the entire rural area is devastated, the people's livelihood is ruined, and the foundation of the country is shaken. And due to the economic panic, the surging tide, the powers are now eyeing covetously, and all want to control my country with their huge economic power, so that my country actually falls into the hell of a secondary colony. Therefore, my country is already in the most difficult period. If my country does not prepare to implement a planned economy at this time, and break the current state of economic disorder with planned action, then in the long run, the national lifeline and people's livelihood will be difficult to continue, and the result will inevitably fall into the tragic situation of the economic co-management of the powers. Therefore, the recent proposal by Song Ziwen to implement a planned economy after returning from the World Economic Conference, as well as the central government's recent move to expand the organization of the Economic Commission, should also be regarded as a measure to adapt to the needs of the times and have a refreshing atmosphere. Speaking of implementing a planned economy, we should first understand its prerequisites. What are the prerequisites? That is, (1) there should be a strong and powerful central government, (2) it should be an independent and self-reliant country, (3) there should be accurate investigation and statistics on resources, population, and industrial production figures, (4) there should be capital and technical personnel available for use, (5) there should be precise plans suitable for national conditions. These five are indispensable prerequisites, and especially the first point is more important. For this reason, it is especially difficult for my country to implement a planned economy today. First, my country's central government orders cannot yet reach all provinces, and many remote areas still act arbitrarily. The whole country cannot be united, so once a planned economy is implemented, there will be more resistance. This is one of the obstacles. Second, my country's economy is inherently backward compared to European and American powers. Precisely because of its backwardness, it has almost been completely controlled by European and American powers in recent years. In terms of financial business, the entire control is held by bankers in New York, London, Paris, and Tokyo, which is tantamount to the general hub that dominates the entire national economic life of my country. In terms of transportation, whether it is railways on land, waterways by water, or airways by air, they are almost all monopolized by the powers. I have lost the control of the transportation pulse. In terms of industry, both heavy industry and light industry are also controlled by the capital forces of the powers. Under its high pressure, my country's industries are dying. What is even worse is that today, all countries in the world are doing their best to raise their tariff barriers to prevent the intrusion of foreign goods and protect their domestic industries. Only my country's tariffs have not yet implemented a protection policy. As a result, foreign goods pour in, and rights and interests spill over. The economic power of the powers extends into my country's poor and remote areas. My country's production business is unable to compete with it. If it is not a vassal, it will go bankrupt. If a planned economy is implemented at once, this foreign capital force will inevitably make a strong reaction. This is the second obstacle. Third, in the past, my country's state-owned enterprises were mostly corrupt and unbearable. The state-owned enterprises were called state-owned, but in fact they were mostly controlled by bureaucrats. Their employment administration was unplanned, and they were all ignorant of business common sense. They were only able to invade public funds and enrich their own pockets. Therefore, state-owned enterprises, the content of food, is not worth asking. As for private enterprises, they suffer from the thinness of capital, the burden of taxes, the chaos of turmoil, and the high pressure of foreign capital forces. There are also very few that are relatively large-scale and have a tight organization that is sufficient to be promising. Therefore, today, in terms of planned economy, the shortage of capital, and even the lack of talents, are also major obstacles. This is the third obstacle. Fourth, my country's society has not yet completely broken away from the scope of agricultural economy. The consciousness of farmers is mostly scattered and unorganized. This kind of scattered and unorganized people also have obstacles to the implementation of a planned economy. This is the fourth obstacle. Summarizing the above four points, it can be seen that my country is urgently waiting for the implementation of a planned economy, but in terms of the environment, there are many obstacles, and it is not easy to ignore them. Then, shall we sit back and watch in front of these reefs, and continue to follow the old ways and shrink back? This is absolutely impossible. However, those who fear difficulties are still hindered by difficulties. On the contrary, in the dictionary of those who are brave, resolute, willing to sacrifice and struggle, there is absolutely no word (difficult). My country is rich in resources, and the treasures are piled up like mountains. Nature has given me richness and generosity. Then, if we are willing to devote ourselves to economic transformation with the greatest determination and the spirit of greatest sacrifice, that is, to engage in the implementation of a planned economy, it is also not difficult to reap the greatest benefits. Moreover, my country's planned economy movement, in Dr. Sun Yat-sen's industrial plan, such as developing industry, such as borrowing foreign capital, and technical talents have long been taken into account. We must adhere to his legacy, examine the current environment, study precise plans, and with the most fair and greatest sincerity, overcome obstacles, and do things in a practical way. People make things happen. We must not limit ourselves by difficulties. What is said in this article is a general discussion. Later, we will contribute our views on its theory and implementation plan separately. At the same time, we sincerely hope that my government and my people will all rise up to make practical discussions on this issue.</p>
<h3>Xu Shanxiang Speaks on the American Recovery Plan</h3>
<p>International Problems Research Association Invites, Only Increasing National Productivity Can Save the Nation</p>
<p>Xinsheng News Agency says, the International Problems Research Association held a tea party for members at the Bank Club at 5 p.m. on the 22nd. They specially invited Mr. Xu Shanxiang, former technical supervisor of the Ministry of Industry, to speak on the American Industrial Recovery Plan. Mr. Xu had just returned to Shanghai from the United States, so he has a deep understanding of the plan. The following is a record of his speech:</p>
<p>I have traveled to the United States three times. The first time was before the European War, when the major railways had just been completed, domestic businesses were proceeding along natural lines, the people lived and worked in peace, and the economy was exceptionally stable. The second time was after the European War, when scientific progress was too rapid, the rich became extremely rich, and industrial expansion was excessive. Stock prices far exceeded their actual value, and the economy gradually showed signs of instability. This trip to the United States was after the Great Depression, when industry and commerce were extremely depressed, and the economy was extraordinarily panicked. This kind of depression phenomenon exists in all countries, but the United States has the most developed industry, so the impact it suffers is also greater than that of other countries. There are roughly four major reasons for the American depression: (1) Industry developed too quickly, resulting in overproduction and supply exceeding demand; (2) War debts were delayed and financial security was stagnant, resulting in weak purchasing power and reduced consumption; (3) American manufactured goods take the world as their market. Now all countries in the world have greatly increased their tariff barriers, and most of the gold-using countries have implemented a virtual gold standard, but the United States is not doing so, resulting in higher prices and inability to compete with others; (4) The invention of a large number of machines has replaced manual labor, resulting in an increasing number of unemployed people. To fundamentally solve this depression problem, it is necessary to rely on the strength of the whole world. The United States, seeing this, held great hope before the opening of the world conference. Secretary of State Hull, on the day of his departure from the United States to England, published an article that roughly stated, (No country in the world can prosper alone. To save the current depression, it is necessary to abandon its closed-door policy and unanimously join the international economic plan, and especially take the reduction of tariff barriers, the stabilization of international exchange rates, and the creation of a standard currency as the three prerequisites. If we follow this path, I know that the prices of major commodities in the world market will naturally increase, and all countries will benefit from it.) The above can represent the psychology of the entire American people. If this goal can be achieved, not only can the American problem be solved, but the depression of the whole world can be eliminated. It is a pity that none of the countries participating in the conference are not selfish and self-interested, and they all want to sacrifice the interests of others without being willing to sacrifice their own interests in the slightest. After the meeting for several weeks, there were no results, and the American depression became more and more serious. Thereupon, President Roosevelt suddenly realized that international empty talk was not to be relied upon, and immediately changed his policy, starting with internal rectification, Put house in order first. He organized the National Recovery Committee, with General Johnson as chairman, and stipulated various industry taxes, inviting the national masses to participate, which is the so-called Blue Eagle Movement. The main purpose of the Blue Eagle Movement is nothing more than the three major principles of increasing wages, reducing working hours, and controlling mass production. According to General Johnson's recent announcement, since the start of the movement, there have been three phenomena: (1) Two million unemployed people have found jobs, and the extra wages paid each week amount to 30 million US dollars. It is expected that 3 million positions can be found before the next Labor Day to settle the unemployed; (2) The government's revenue deficit at the end of last year was 300 million yuan, which can be reduced to 100 million yuan by the end of this year; (3) The 500 million yuan in eight-year government bonds and 350 million yuan in short-term government bonds issued by the government have been sold out, and those who came later even regretted it. This movement is not stipulated in the constitution, but is initiated by the president, requesting the national masses to join unanimously. It is scheduled for a two-year trial period. If the trial is successful, it may be made into law. After the start of the trial, within one year, no matter who is engaged in what occupation, they must obtain a license from the government. Those who join this movement can receive the Blue Eagle sign at the post office after signing and hang it in the store to preside over its affairs. It uses patriotism as its slogan, so even if there are a few people who are not very willing, they have to join. The three letters Z.r.A. originally represent National recovery Aet. (National Recovery Plan), but there are also those who ridicule it as No re- a.an Asked, which is probably the argument of those who are slightly dissatisfied with the government's authoritarianism. The Recovery Committee's plan also has some self-contradictory points. The biggest ones are three: (1) In order to increase grain prices, the government eliminated 15 million acres of cotton fields, subsidizing farmers from 6 to 12 yuan per acre. At the same time, the recovery plan stipulates that 330 million yuan will be used to promote public utilities, a part of which will be used for the completion of the hydropower plan of Muscie Shoals and Boulder Dam. On the one hand, cotton fields are eliminated, and on the other hand, new farmland is irrigated. It is really difficult to implement two steady policies simultaneously; (2) Increasing wages and reducing working hours both increase costs, but purchasing power has not increased in the same way. There is no certainty in terms of sales; (3) Someone has to produce, and someone has to consume. There is still a lot of open space in the central United States that can be reclaimed, but the Red Indians are already extinct, and the white people are not increasing. Immigration is also strictly restricted. Relying solely on the current Americans to consume American products will ultimately not solve the supply and demand problem. Although the recovery plan has various difficulties, there are several points that are very admirable and worthy of our reference: (1) President Luo and his cabinet members have great determination to implement the recovery plan and will not give up despite all setbacks. They act immediately after speaking, so within a few months, they have achieved considerable results, unlike China, which only relies on empty talk on paper, year after year, without accomplishing anything; (2) After the Roosevelt government identifies a policy, it proceeds according to this plan in an orderly manner, unlike China, which is indecisive and changes its orders in the morning and evening; (3) President Roosevelt uses sincere words to inform the public through radio every two or three days. Based on the facts, all the words come from the heart, and the people are moved by them, unlike the Chinese, whose words and actions contradict each other, resulting in the loss of the people's faith; (4) The American people can grant the government considerable power in times of tense situations so that it can act expediently. Even the Republican Party, which opposes the Democratic Party, can sacrifice its political views and support it unanimously. This kind of spirit is indispensable for republican citizens, but the Chinese completely lack it. Although 500 million square miles of territory have been lost and the great enemy is already at the door, internal fighting still occurs every day, fearing that the country will not perish. Because of these four factors, the American recovery undertaking is very promising. I now have the most sincere words to tell the people, that is, within a few years, China will have a very large depression, which will be ten times greater than today. The value of foreign goods imported last year reached more than 89.1 million gold units, and the quantity of native goods exported was only worth more than 41.9 million gold units. The import surplus was about 47.19 million gold units, or 87 million yuan in national currency. Calculated at 400 million people, each person bears about 2 yuan and 20 cents. Judging from China's current situation, the vast majority of people are so poor that they have no place to stand. How can they have the strength to take out 2 yuan per person and send it to foreign countries? It is inevitable that the entire nation will go bankrupt. The American depression is due to overproduction, and the Chinese depression is due to a lack of production. To save the country, there are only seven words: increase national productivity. These seven words were implemented by Mussolini in Italy, turning weakness into strength, and by Stalin in Russia, turning poverty into wealth. The paths taken are different, but the goal is the same. I hope that truly patriotic people will think deeply about this.</p>
<h3>Measures for Tax Exemption for Flour Mills Purchasing Wheat</h3>
<p>The Municipal Government Has Received an Official Letter from the Ministry of Finance Ordering Compliance</p>
<p>Riri News Agency says that the Ministry of Finance previously received a request from the Shanghai Flour Mill Association to exempt flour mills' branch offices from business tax for selling flour and purchasing wheat. The Ministry held that since wheat flour is subject to a unified tax collected by the central government, provinces and cities should not levy business tax on the manufacturing industry within the scope of the flour mill itself. As for the branch offices or wholesale offices set up by the mills, if they are promoting and selling the flour produced by the mill and have business income, then the branch offices of the mills are neither directly paying the unified tax nor acting as agents for the mill's business of contacting and transferring. They should be taxed according to the business tax of the sales industry. However, after the establishment of the wheat flour tax, the regulations clearly stipulate that the wheat used by each mill as raw material is generally given a tax exemption certificate. Now, the branch offices of each flour mill directly purchase wheat, which is specifically used as the mill's flour-making raw material, which is completely the same in nature as the situation when the mills purchased wheat from various places for flour-making when the wheat flour tax was first established. In order to maintain the central government's wheat flour tax revenue and take into account the commercial difficulties, the Riri News Agency reporter has found and recorded the three items of the approved tax exemption measures for each flour mill's purchase of wheat raw materials as follows: (1) The branch offices of each flour mill must be registered with the Ministry of Industry and directly purchase wheat, which is indeed exclusively for the raw material of the mill's flour-making, and there is no printing behavior. After the competent collection agency verifies that it is consistent, the business tax will be exempted; (2) The offices of each flour mill, in addition to purchasing wheat, should still be taxed according to the business tax if they operate and sell flour and also operate other items; (3) If each flour mill has not established a branch office in the producing area and sends personnel to directly purchase wheat raw materials, the flour mill must be registered with the Ministry of Industry and a certificate is issued by the local Chamber of Commerce, confirming that the purchase is for the use of the mill's raw materials and not for transfer and sale. After the competent collection agency verifies that it is consistent, the business tax should be exempted. Those who have counterfeit factory brands, open branches in the producing area to purchase, or other merchants who operate wheat, in order to prevent selling for profit and taking advantage of loopholes to evade tax, are not within the scope of tax exemption. In addition to consulting with the provincial and municipal governments to order the competent agencies to follow the above measures, the municipal government has received the consultation text yesterday,</p>

<h3>Giant Bear Escapes from Municipal Zoo Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>Finally Captured by a Crowd of Workers, but an Old Man Has Been Frightened</p>
<p>Central News Agency says, at about 9:00 a.m. yesterday morning, a large bear suddenly broke free from its lock and escaped from the Municipal Zoo on Wenmiao Road. At that time, a reporter happened to be touring the park, and there were also dozens of other tourists, all of whom were frightened and ran away to avoid it. After the bear escaped, the zoo's administrator hurriedly closed all three gates of the park, temporarily suspending visits in order to capture it. Dozens of people fought the bear, each holding wooden sticks, hemp ropes, and thick iron wires. An old man dressed neatly was caught off guard and could not avoid it. The bear pounced directly on his body, and the old man fell in shock. Fortunately, the bear's teeth had already been removed, so he was not injured, but his clothes were torn by the claws and he was thoroughly frightened. When the pursuers arrived, the bear fled elsewhere. After about half an hour, it was finally surrounded by the park's administrator and workers, some pulling its neck with ropes and others hitting its legs with sticks. The bear finally succumbed and was led back into its cage. The park was reopened as usual after 10:00 a.m.</p>
<h3>White Russian Detachment of Merchant Corps Suffers Food Poisoning After Lunch</h3>
<p>Meat Has Been Handed Over to the Public Works Department for Analysis</p>
<p>Dalu News Agency says, 115 members of the White Russian and detachment of the Shanghai Merchant Corps stationed at the Target Field called out with stomach pains yesterday (the 21st) after lunch. They urgently summoned the regimental physician Kushnizov, but Mr. Kushnizov could not determine what kind of poison it was, but he believed that the meat used for lunch must have contained toxic bacteria. Therefore, he sent a piece of the remaining meat to the Public Works Department for analysis, and a report may be released tomorrow (the 23rd). However, the meat used by other detachments was all supplied by the same vendor, and no abnormalities occurred after the first detachment of the White Russian regiment ate it, and they were as good as usual. As for the 115 people who suffered from stomach pains, they were more peaceful by late at night, and they should be able to fully recover their health today (the 22nd).</p>
<h3>Wireless Radio Alarm in Cars</h3>
<p>In Case of Kidnapping, a Warning Signal Can Be Sent Immediately, the Public Works Department Board Has Approved the Application</p>
<p>During the Public Works Department's regular Wednesday board meeting in the Public Concession, the board approved the Police Committee's suggestion to allow the Wireless Radio Security Company to install wireless radio alarms in cars and cooperate with the police to operate this wireless radio alarm system. According to the company, it has requested a special patent for five years to install receiving radios in police stations and automatic generators in user-owned cars. In case of kidnapping, a warning signal can be sent immediately to report to the police. According to the company's report, the installation of a generator by the user costs between 700 and 1,200 yuan per unit. All expenses for installing and maintaining the receiving radios in the police station and training the patrol police to receive warning signals will be borne by the company. When the Police Committee considered this request, the Chief Inspector reported his support for this move and advocated that if it is necessary to increase personnel in addition to the original personnel in the traffic management room, the company should bear all the expenses. After discussion by the committee, it was decided to recommend to the board that it be allowed to handle it for three years, with all expenses borne by the company, provided that its effectiveness can satisfy the Public Works Department.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Communications Orders New Telegraph Machines from England</h3>
<p>Kleinschmidt High-Speed Telegraph Machines, Seven Units Worth £13,000, Will Be Shipped to Shanghai at the End of the Month</p>
<p>The telegraph machines used by various telegraph offices in China are all of the English-made Erls and Weston types. Although these machines have a high speed of sending and receiving telegraphs, it is necessary to re-drill holes in the paper when relaying telegraphs, which is a pity. Recently, countries around the world have adopted British-made Kleinschmidt high-speed motors because this machine can save the hand-operated process of drilling and pressing when relaying telegraphs. The Ministry of Communications has ordered seven units from England, worth £13,000. According to the news from the local telegraph office, all the machinery of the telegraph machine has been shipped from England to Shanghai and will arrive at the port at the end of this month. It is also heard that after the telegraph machine is shipped, the Ministry of Communications plans to distribute it to Shanghai, Nanjing, Hankou, Tianjin, Beiping, Qingdao, Yantai, and other telegraph offices.</p>

<p>Wang Xue, a woman from Dinghai, Zhejiang, who resides at No. 12 Renqing Lane, Huade Road, has a daughter named Zhaodi, who is now 19 years old. Because of poverty, Ms. Wang recommended Zhaodi to Suzuki, the director of the Yokohama Specie Bank on the Bund, as a maid. However, a local man named Cao Wenyu, who works in the writing room of the Specie Bank, was able to see Wang Zhaodi every morning and evening, and over time, feelings arose, and there was inevitably an ambiguous relationship between the two parties. Recently, Wang Zhaodi's mother, Wang Xue, suddenly hired lawyer Peng Qixiu to file a lawsuit with the First Special District Court, accusing Cao Wenyu of harming social customs, damaging reputation, and other offenses. The reason for the lawsuit is roughly as follows: Ms. Wang's daughter, Zhaodi, was originally a maid in the home of the Japanese director Suzuki on the fifth floor of the Specie Bank. The defendant worked as a clerk in the writing room of the bank, and they only knew each other from seeing each other morning and evening. Unexpectedly, the defendant seduced her with frivolous words. On April 13 of this year, Cao falsely said that a relative was waiting outside. When Zhaodi went out, she did not see anyone. The defendant then tricked Zhaodi into going to the Bund Park across the street, and lured her with sweet words, asking if Zhaodi had been promised to anyone. He expressed his willingness to get engaged to her. In June, because Cao repeatedly invited her, she once went to the New Central Theater to see a movie with him. Later, at about 10 p.m. on July 25, Cao insisted on taking her to the Southeast Theater to see a play. After the show, Cao again asked Zhaodi to go to a hotel room, but she refused and returned to the bank. Cao invited her to sit in his room for a while, but after entering the room, Cao immediately closed the door and demanded pleasure. When she was about to shout, he threatened her, saying that if she did not agree, he would rather die with her immediately, otherwise the two of them would become husband and wife forever. He knelt down and swore that he had no second thoughts. Zhaodi was still young and inexperienced, and was raped. Zhaodi thought that since she had lost her virginity to Cao, she could only pursue his vows. Therefore, on the evening of August 29, she went to Cao's room to ask for an engagement note. Cao immediately gave her a photo of himself without a picture, and asked Zhaodi to keep it as proof of their engagement, saying that they would take one together later. Then, he raped her again. Unexpectedly, Cao suddenly sent a letter the next day, and was frivolous. Zhaodi immediately broke off with him. After investigating, Zhaodi is a weak woman and is not yet an adult. She was seduced and raped, and her reputation was ruined. She was so ashamed and indignant that she repeatedly wanted to kill herself, but was fortunately discovered and told the truth. However, the defendant's behavior has violated Articles 244, 315, and 328 of the Criminal Law. It should be requested to summon the case and investigate according to the law. Yesterday afternoon, this case was heard by Judge Liu Tonggui in the Second Criminal Court. The plaintiff mother and daughter came to court with their lawyer and stated the previous situation, while the defendant did not appear. Lawyer Shen Xingxia came to the court and stated that Cao was suddenly suffering from the plague and could not come to court today. He requested permission to postpone the hearing in order to argue. It was then filed a counterclaim. Judge Liu ordered that the case be rescheduled for the 28th.</p>
<h3>Robbers Kill a Man in Yangjing Town, Stealing Goods</h3>
<p>Not Satisfied with Robbing 20 Yuan, They Dared to Open Fire and Shoot the Victim</p>
<p>In Chenmajiazhai, more than half a mile east of Yangjing Town in Pudong, there is a house with two wings. The door number of the east half is number one, and the west half is number two. At about 8:00 p.m. the night before, five or six thugs with a northern accent who looked like robbers suddenly came. Two of them broke down the door and entered. First, they broke into the room of Ma Quangui, a resident of the west half, and searched it. Seeing that there was no money or valuables, they pulled out a pistol and forced Quangui to lead them to the bedroom of his cousin Ma Yingquan in the east half. They forced Ma to sit on the bed and forced him to tell them where the 3,000 yuan in cash was hidden. Yingquan replied that he had always been poor and had no such huge amount of money, but he only had 20 yuan by his side, which they could take. The robbers were greatly disappointed and pointed the pistol at Yingquan's chest, releasing the trigger. With a loud bang, the bullet entered from the left breast and did not penetrate backwards. Yingquan fell to the ground on the spot and died in a moment because the bullet hit a vital point. The robbers then broke out the door and fled. Soon, Jiang, the director of the Second Station of the Third District, was informed and immediately led armed police to search around for the robbers, but the robbers had disappeared like yellow cranes. He then ordered the local guarantor Ma Zhangquan to report to the local court yesterday morning and send someone to inspect the body. At the same time, he prepared a document to report to the General Bureau to arrest the murderer.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Health Pays Attention to Citizens' Health</h3>
<p>丨The South Shanghai Clinic Will Open at the Beginning of Next Month丨</p>
<p>Adopting Scientific Methods for Garbage Disposal, the Plan to Establish a Public Cemetery Continues</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Health will soon establish the South Shanghai Clinic in South Shanghai to facilitate citizens. It will also use scientific methods to handle the garbage problem in the city, and the construction of a public cemetery is also in active progress. The news is recorded separately as follows:</p>
<h3>Adding Clinics</h3>
<p>The bureau believes that the South Shanghai district has a dense population, and although there are already one or two hospitals, they are still insufficient. Therefore, it has prepared a plan and submitted it to the municipal government to set up another South Shanghai Clinic. The municipal government believes that the bureau's request is indeed needed and has already instructed its approval. It also ordered the Finance Bureau to allocate 4,800 yuan for the establishment of the clinic and stipulated a recurring expense of 1,000 yuan per month. The Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Health has received the funds from the Finance Bureau and is actively preparing. In addition to surveying and determining the Yude Lane opposite the old county office on Lai Road as the site of the hospital, various clinical instruments and medicines have also been prepared separately, and physicians have also been hired separately. It is learned that the institute will be officially opened at the beginning of next month.</p>
<h3>Garbage Disposal</h3>
<p>The Municipal Bureau of Health believes that the issue of garbage disposal in the city is very important to the health of citizens. Therefore, it specially hired Mr. Ma, an engineer, to prepare a plan for garbage disposal in the city based on scientific methods. It is learned that after the implementation of the plan, many of the previous abuses can be eliminated. Among them, the garbage collection of scavengers is no longer based on the size of the area, but on the weight of the collected garbage, stipulating the weight of garbage transported by each person per day to ensure fairness. As for the garbage piling field, it is temporarily still at Longhuazui, as this place can still be used for several years. However, in order to prepare for a rainy day, they are still looking for low-lying areas for future use. In addition, the drainage of ditches in various districts was previously handled by the municipal commissioners' offices in each district, but each district cannot handle it seriously. Currently, the bureau has taken over the districts of Gaoqiao and Pusong, and the results have improved compared with the past. Other districts will also be taken over successively.</p>
<h3>Founding a Public Cemetery</h3>
<p>The Bureau once established the First Public Cemetery in Jiangwan. However, due to the Ministry of Railways' planned relocation of the railway line, the cemetery site was included within its boundaries, leading to a suspension of the project. Now, the Ministry of Railways, facing financial difficulties, has temporarily shelved the plan. Therefore, the Bureau is now proceeding with it again. Once the cemetery foundation is leveled, the First Public Cemetery can be rented out. A site has also been selected in Beixinjing, but due to limited funds, it is feared that it cannot be realized in the short term. As for taking over the International Cemetery, it is difficult to achieve for the time being.</p>
<p>Family of Han Donghui</p>
<h3>Refuting the Gold Exchange's Claims: On What Basis Does the Exchange Conclude Han Died of Natural Causes? If Not Shielding a Criminal, Why Not Announce the Name?</h3>
<p>Xin Xin News reports: Han Donghui, a native of Yuyao, Zhejiang, suddenly collapsed and died after being knocked down in the market by a fellow member of the Gold Exchange while negotiating a transaction. Since the incident, it has been widely attributed to the Exchange's inadequate facilities, which has attracted the attention of the authorities in the foreign concession. Now, according to Mrs. Han Hongshi, Mr. Han's widow, who spoke to a Xin Xin News reporter yesterday, she has petitioned the Party and government agencies to investigate her husband's death at the Gold Exchange market. Recently, she saw in the September 16th edition of the "Shi Shi Xin Bao" (The China Times) a letter from lawyer Chen Zhongyin, representing the Gold Exchange, stating that on August 22nd of this year, an unnamed person ran into the market from outside and suddenly fainted in the crowd. A companion hired a rickshaw to take him to Renji Hospital for treatment. The hospital doctor diagnosed him with a pre-existing condition, gave him an injection, but he died before treatment could be completed. The letter implied that his death was due to natural causes. Mrs. Han questions on what basis the Gold Exchange can determine her husband's death was due to natural causes. The letter states that the person ran into the market from outside, meaning he was moving freely. How can someone who is moving freely suddenly die and be said to have died of natural causes? This is neither reasonable nor logical. If the Exchange is not shielding a criminal, why make such an illogical statement? Moreover, Renji Hospital did not provide a diagnosis. The Exchange determined the death was due to natural causes on its own and then implied it was the hospital's diagnosis, which is even more strange. What she hopes for from the Exchange is to investigate and announce the name of the assailant so she can file a complaint. Now that the Exchange has described the facts and published them in the newspaper, it should take responsibility for the investigation. Why has the assailant's name remained hidden? This is what the widow cannot understand. As for the Exchange's inadequate facilities, there is no denying it. Now, in order to shield the criminal, they falsely claim her husband suddenly fainted. How can someone faint in a well-ventilated place? Trying to cover up only makes things worse. Judging from the Exchange's letter, it is more than likely that her husband died a violent death. She implores the press to uphold a sense of compassion and reveal the truth of this matter in the newspaper so that everyone knows her husband died a violent death and is not simply dismissed by the Exchange's deceptive words. If so, the living and the dead will be grateful.</p>
<p>Most were rejected and not rehired. Even those who were hired had their wages greatly reduced, even more so than in the spring. This caused great panic among the workers, who reported it to the garment workers' union and convened a general meeting. In addition to petitioning the Municipal Party Headquarters and the Social Bureau for relief, they are also preparing to take appropriate measures to deal with the situation.</p>
<h3>Jardine Matheson Tug and Lighter Strike: All Lighterage Operations Halted, Party and Government to Send Personnel for Mediation Today</h3>
<p>All workers of the British-owned Jardine Matheson Tug and Lighter Company went on strike because the company dismissed a large number of workers without reason. All one hundred and two large and small lighters have ceased loading cargo and are anchored at Lujiazui in Pudong and Yangshupu. Since the workers went on strike, the loading and unloading of goods on the company's vessels has been greatly affected. Therefore, yesterday, the company intended to ask the police to force the workers to resume work, but the request was rejected. As a result, all cargo companies that contracted with the company have contacted it to demand compensation for losses. It is now heard that the company is quite willing to resume work as soon as possible. The Party and government agencies had already received a petition from the workers. Yesterday, they held a meeting to discuss how to handle the situation. Today, they will send personnel to mediate according to the law.</p>
<p>Fashion Workers Dismissed and Wages Reduced</p>
<h3>Re-igniting the Brewing Labor Unrest</h3>
<p>Garment Workers' Union Convenes a Meeting to Discuss Petitioning Party and Government Agencies for Relief and Assistance</p>
<p>There are more than 500 fashion garment workers in this city, working in more than 40 fashion stores throughout the city, specializing in making fashionable women's autumn and winter coats and evening gowns. The wages for each piece range from one yuan and several jiao to more than two yuan. In April of this year, the owners of the industry suddenly announced a reduction of wages of several jiao per piece, citing slow business, which caused dissatisfaction among the workers and led to a strike. Later, the Garment Industry Workers' Union petitioned the Party and government agencies to convene a meeting of both parties for mediation. Four clauses were agreed upon and the original wages were restored, and the labor unrest ended. Later, as the weather gradually warmed up, there was no business for fashionable garments, so the workers of the industry returned to their hometowns for a summer rest, as usual. Unexpectedly, the owners of the industry took the opportunity to greatly increase the number of apprentices and hired unskilled workers to take advantage of their cheap labor and lack of organization. Now that the autumn season has arrived and business is booming, the old workers have returned to the stores to resume their previous work. Unexpectedly, after arriving at the stores, most were rejected and not rehired. Even those who were hired had their wages greatly reduced, even more so than in the spring. This caused great panic among the workers, who reported it to the garment workers' union and convened a general meeting. In addition to petitioning the Municipal Party Headquarters and the Social Bureau for relief, they are also preparing to take appropriate measures to deal with the situation.</p>
<p>A Young Widow, Jia Lin, Remarries</p>
<h3>Marriage Certificate Already Obtained from Zhenjiang</h3>
<p>Lin Xianjian's Witnesses are Mostly Relatives and Friends; Jia Lin Expressed Strong Opposition and Fiercely Criticized</p>
<p>The young widow Fei Lin, also known as Jia Huixian, who used to work at the Municipal Government's Health Bureau, formally married Wu Bin (named Hui Bai), a staff member of the First Section of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, at the World Hotel in the capital on July 20th of this year. Afterwards, she sent a letter to Lin Xianjian, a native of Jieyang, Guangdong, who owns the Xianjian Hospital at No. 204 Jiangxi Road in this city, declaring that she was breaking off her cohabitation relationship with Lin and asking for the return of her belongings. After receiving the letter, Lin claimed that Jia Lin had married him in her hometown of Jieyang on August 24th of last year. This time, she fled without her husband on July 24th and dared to remarry, which was unforgivable under the law. Therefore, he immediately replied to Jia Lin, asking her to come to Shanghai to pick up her belongings. As a result, Jia and Wu came from Zhenjiang to visit Lin Xianjian in person. Lin reported it to the General Police Station, which dispatched detectives to arrest Jia and Wu together and filed a lawsuit with the First Special District District Court for bigamy. There was a preliminary hearing, and the court ordered the defendants to be released on bail, to be summoned at any time, and dispatched detectives to Zhenjiang to retrieve their marriage certificate with Wu for verification. As reported in previous newspapers, it is now learned that the marriage certificate for Jia and Wu's marriage in the capital has been retrieved by the General Police Station, who dispatched a detective accompanied by Jia Lin to Zhenjiang. The introducers were Jiang Tianji and Han Cheng, and the witnesses were Zhou Bangdao and Yang Junmai. The seal affixed under Jia Lin's name is different from the one affixed on the certificate presented by Lin Xianjian. On the 20th of this month, the court approved Jia Lin's request and issued a search warrant, ordering Chinese and Western detectives to go to Lin's hospital to search Lin Xianjian's patient registration book, Jia Lin's luggage, and correspondence between Jia and Lin. However, the search resulted in only one registration book, and the luggage was nowhere to be found. Yesterday morning was the date for the continued hearing of the case. The original plaintiffs and defendants, each accompanied by their lawyers, arrived in court. At 10:45 AM, Judge Feng Shide conducted the hearing. First, Police Lawyer Qian Xunjiu stated the situation of dispatching detectives to Zhenjiang to retrieve the marriage certificate and searching Lin Xianjian's residence. He then presented the certificate and the seized books to the court. The handling detective then reported the process and stated that Ma Fengting, who lives at No. 216 Fusheng Lane, Bazi Road, had been summoned, but he refused to appear in court as a witness. The court then questioned Jia Lin, who stated that on August 26th and 28th of last year, there were patients registered, which showed that Lin Xianjian was still in Shanghai at that time. How could he have gone to Guangdong to get married? Lin Xianjian, upon hearing this, stated that he went to Guangdong on August 19th and returned to Shanghai on August 30th. During this period, Dr. Yang was entrusted to handle the medical practice. Yang is now in Hangzhou and can be summoned for questioning. In addition, the clerk of the Yixing Shipping Ticket Office at No. 89 Gongguan Road can be summoned to prove that he purchased tickets from the office and took a boat to Guangdong. Also, those who came to my hospital for treatment can be summoned to prove that I was not in the hospital at that time and that Dr. Yang treated them on my behalf. However, Jia Lin objected to the witnesses presented by the plaintiff because they were not from the same hometown, that is, relatives. As a result, they criticized each other. The plaintiff then invited his former classmate, Wu Yanglie, who is now studying at Shanghai University, to the court to testify that he had gone to Lin's house to eat wedding banquet on August 24th of last year, but did not witness the wedding ceremony. Subsequently, Cao Lin requested that the photo studio and negatives where the plaintiff presented the photo of her wearing only a bridal gown be investigated in Jieyang. The plaintiff's lawyer, Wu Yu, also provided several suggestions regarding the investigation of evidence. Judge Feng then ordered that the case be adjourned to October 7th for further hearing.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Art College National Crisis Propaganda Troupe to Hold Exhibitions in Shanghai in Stages</h3>
<p>And Prepare for a Second Long-Distance Propaganda Campaign</p>
<p>The Shanghai Art College National Crisis Propaganda Troupe returned from Mongolia at the beginning of the month and went to Beijing last week to hold a Mongolian Border and North China Sketch Exhibition. From the 16th to the 20th, the exhibition opened for five days at the Confucius Temple Library in the capital. More than 50,000 people visited, making it an unprecedented event. The troupe is now returning to Shanghai and will hold exhibitions in stages at the YMCA and the People's Education Center to awaken people in the Southeast to thoroughly understand the truth about the Mongolian border and promote the success of developing the Northwest. It is also learned that the troupe will come to Shanghai soon to prepare tools for the second long-distance propaganda campaign, which includes making large quantities of materials such as large-scale murals, colored picture newspapers, lantern slide propaganda, and propaganda booklets, which are expected to be completed in three weeks. They will depart on the Double Tenth Festival and travel through 18 provinces: Jiangsu, Shandong, Hebei, Shanxi, Chahar, Suiyuan, Ningxia, Gansu, Qinghai, Shaanxi, Sichuan, Hubei, Hunan, Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan, Fujian, and Zhejiang, lasting ten months and covering more than 30,000 miles. This trip will still focus on national crisis propaganda, communicate the feelings of the five ethnic groups, break down North-South barriers, and unite the country to resist foreign insults.</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese School's Rental Dispute Involves Litigation in Court</h3>
<p>Zhu Qizhao, who resides at No. 609 Continental Market, Nanjing Road, recently leased a piece of land at No. 9514 and 9888 on West Adams Road for a term of 25 years. He then raised funds to build houses, which are now at No. 485 Lane, West Adams Road. However, the construction of these houses required 185,000 taels. Because Zhu did not have this large sum, he mortgaged the land lease contract and the ownership of the rent to the Huizhong Bank for 120,000 taels for a term of ten years, during which the loan would be repaid in twelve installments. At the end of the term, the house would still belong to Zhu Qizhao, and the mortgage would also be cleared. In March of this year, the private Overseas Chinese Middle School wanted to expand its school buildings and saw that the lane was quite suitable. Therefore, it discussed with Zhu Qizhao to purchase the houses, and after several negotiations, the price was agreed upon at 264,200 taels. The contract was also set for ten years, and the payment method was set at 145 installments. The Overseas Chinese Middle School first paid 1,374 taels and 34 cents as the first installment. The Overseas Chinese Middle School believed that since it had invested in purchasing all the rights to the land and houses, the right to collect rent had been transferred to it. When the rent collection period arrived, the Huizhong Bank had already collected the rent. When it inquired with the Huizhong Bank, it replied that it was subject to the mortgage rights. Therefore, the Overseas Chinese Middle School suspected Zhu Qizhao of fraudulent behavior and filed a complaint with the First Special District Court, accusing Zhu of the crime of fraud. Yesterday afternoon, the case was heard in the Fifth Criminal Court. Ma Canhan, the legal representative of the Overseas Chinese Middle School, appeared in court to state the above situation and said that the Overseas Chinese Middle School and the defendant signed a contract (in English, the contract stated that the defendant would transfer the land lease contract and the ownership mortgage contract to the Huizhong Bank to the Overseas Chinese, and the transfer contract also designated the Puyi Bank as its trustee and had full power to fulfill the contract. At the time, the witness in attendance was Huang Zongxun, a representative of the Puyi Company, who agreed that after the transfer contract was signed, he would transfer the Huizhong Bank's mortgage and all contracts to the trustee (that is, Puyi) for safekeeping, and the Overseas Chinese could only recover the contract after the above-mentioned promissory notes were paid off in installments. It also stated that Zhu Qizhao would lease the land and houses to the Overseas Chinese in two sections, A and B, with an annual rent of 12,900 taels for section A and 13,200 taels for section B, for a term of ten years, starting from August 1st of this year. By the beginning of August, the term rent had not been received, and the Huizhong Bank replied that Zhu had no right to transfer, etc. According to Zhu Qizhao, the fact that the house was mortgaged to the Huizhong Bank was clearly stated on the transfer contract, which the informant knew in advance. The Huizhong Bank's reply to the Overseas Chinese also only stated that it was subject to mortgage rights, and did not say that it could not be transferred. The transfer contract stated that the Overseas Chinese must find a guarantor for each installment payment, but the Overseas Chinese did not fulfill this obligation, and the期金 (term payment?) of more than 260,000 was not paid on time. Therefore, the plaintiff himself violated the contract first. At this point, Zhu Qizhao's lawyer, Yuan Yang'an, stated that the content of the case was quite complicated. The contract at the time was in English, and the wording was quite unclear. Once translated, it became even more ambiguous. Even this lawyer spent a lot of time studying the details when he took over the case. As a result, he felt that there was no need for a criminal prosecution in this case. Both parties should pay for the contract. Moreover, Zhu Qizhao had invested 65,000 taels in the land. Although he signed a mortgage contract with Huizhong, if the Overseas Chinese paid the required installments in full, the rent he should receive could be taken away at any time. Therefore, there was no fraud. Moreover, the facts listed in the indictment were inconsistent. Therefore, the details of the case were even more difficult to understand. If the plaintiff could calm down and seek a method of reconciliation, it would be good. Otherwise, he should start with civil matters first and clarify the responsibilities on the contract before speaking. As the case still required clarification of the meaning of the contract and witnesses needed to be questioned, the court was adjourned for further questioning at a later date.</p>
<h3>Following the Establishment of the Two-Railway Business Office, Other Railways are Planning to Imitate It</h3>
<p>Representatives from Various Railways Come to Shanghai to Learn</p>
<p>The Jinghu and Huhu Hangyong Railway Business Office, which opened on the 21st of last month at No. 407 Jing'an Temple Road (telephone 35815), has achieved excellent results. Its income in the first month exceeded 10,000 yuan. Now, seeing that the business of the two railways has been booming since the opening of the business office, other railways are planning to imitate it and have sent personnel to visit the office. Those who have come to Shanghai include Zhou Xuexin, Chief of the Business Section of the Beijing-Ningbo Railway, Jin Shixuan, Chief of the Transportation Section of the Hangjiang Railway, Feng Jiantong, Chief of the Car Affairs Section of the Xiang-E Railway, and Zhou Zhiwu, Representative of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway. It is also learned that the authorities of the two railways believe that the Shanghai Business Office can indeed facilitate merchants and passengers, so they have decided to set up branches in Nanjing and the Nanshi area of this city. The Nanjing branch will cooperate with the Tianjin-Pukou Railway, and in Beijing, the Beijing-Ningbo, Ping-Han, and Ping-Sui railways will jointly establish a branch.</p>

<h3>Another Accomplice Arrested in the Case of Chinese and Japanese Conspiring to Rob a Large Sum of Money</h3>
<p>Shi Enlian, chief detective of the Hongkou Police Department, and detective Wang Runhe, previously arrested four criminals: Shi Ruichang from Tongzhou, Xu Fengqing from this city, and Japanese nationals Nishi Eiichi and Hosoya Naraju. They seized a pistol and six bullets. It was found that these people had hired a car from the Far East Motor Company at No. 1 Pingliang Road at about 8:00 AM on August 14th, intending to rob passengers of a large sum of money being transported to the China General Chamber of Commerce Bank for storage. While passing the Chinese boundary of Yangshupu near Jun Gong Road, they bound the driver, Hu Songshan, a native of Ningbo, with lead wire, stuffed his mouth with a towel, and threw him by the roadside. A fellow accomplice, Hu Hanshan, drove to the vicinity of the China General Chamber of Commerce Bank on the Bund of Fuzhou Road, waiting for a long time, but the passenger did not arrive. They abandoned the car and fled. The two Japanese were sent to the Japanese Consulate for trial, and Shi and Xu were sent to the First Special District District Court for trial and detention. This has been reported in detail in this newspaper. The detectives handling the case have now arrested another accomplice, Hu Songshan. Yesterday morning, the three criminals, Lu Shi and others, were transferred to the Third Criminal Court of the Special Court. Judge Wu Zehan questioned them. Police Lawyer Zhang Tianyin stated that the two Japanese in this case confessed during interrogation at the Japanese Consulate that there was another Japanese accomplice named Takamoto (i.e., Zha Xu Huai La). They had discussed it together in advance at the home of the Japanese Nishi Eiichi. A Chinese man named Xiao Xiang had provided information, claiming that his friend Chen Yongyu had notified Chen that he was working at the Baker Road Commercial Transport Company, but Chen denied being an accomplice. He has now been summoned. The ropes and towels seized by the Fifth District Public Security Bureau were presented for inspection. Chen Yongyu then complained that Xiao Xiang had falsely accused him because he had previously refused to lend him money. When questioned, the defendant Shi Ruichang confessed that he had met three times at the home of the Japanese Nishi Eiichi. Xiao Xiang was indeed present at the time. Hu Hanshan was invited by me to be the driver, but he was very frightened of this kind of thing and did not dare to proceed. Nishi Eiichi said that there would be no problem. Xu Fengqing confessed that Xiao Xiang initiated the matter, claiming that a passenger was planning to deposit a large sum of cash to the China General Chamber of Commerce Bank and informed the Japanese Nishi Eiichi, who asked me to translate Japanese. I did not go with them during the robbery, but waited for news at home. Hu Songshan confessed that he had driven a car in Nantong. Shi Ruichang invited him to discuss the matter. He saw three Japanese men. Later, he went to Far East to hire a car. The car was driven to a remote place in the Chinese area. The Japanese tied up the driver and threw him by the roadside, instructing me to drive to the Bund to rob, but the robbery failed. Finally, Judge Wu instructed the defendants to be returned to custody and set a date for sentencing after a public defender Lin Yangqing was appointed to defend the three defendants.</p>
<h3>The Committee for Investigating National Salvation Donations Held a Plenary Committee Meeting Yesterday</h3>

<h3>Representatives from the Jinnan Three Counties Yellow River Disaster Relief Association Arrive in Shanghai Seeking Relief</h3>
<p>Due to the recent Yellow River flooding, the disaster victims along the Yellow River are displaced. The three counties of Changyuan, Dongming, and Puyang in Jinnan suffered the most severe disaster. The Jinnan natives in Tianjin, Pingbao, and other places established the Jinnan Three Counties Yellow River Flood Relief Association in Tianjin to provide disaster relief. Due to limited resources, they specially sent a representative, Mr. Sheng, with a letter to Shanghai yesterday, appealing to Shanghai's charitable organizations to raise a large sum of money for the Yellow River Flood Relief Joint Association for emergency relief to save the disaster-stricken people. Upon learning about the situation, the association considered the matter of great importance and planned to convene a meeting to decide on a solution.</p>
<h3>Thugs Hack Wu Qixing</h3>
<p>Wu Qixing, a native of Ningbo, 30 years old, resides in Hongzhen, Pudong. In recent days, he and his friends secretly operated a lottery in Room 32 of the Xizang Hotel on X Z Road. Local thugs discovered this and attempted to extort money from him. Unable to succeed, they harbored a grudge. Yesterday at noon, Wu was enjoying tea at the Yu Ji stove behind the Hua An Insurance Company on Baker Road when suddenly six thugs arrived. Without asking any questions, they brandished axes and hacked at his left foot five times, his right foot once, and his back four times. He immediately bled profusely and lost consciousness. The assailants, seeing their objective achieved, immediately dispersed. Patrol officer No. 2844 discovered him and rushed him by car to Renji Hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3>Three New Ghosts in the City of the Wrongfully Dead</h3>
<p>Han Chungao Crushed to Death. At 8:35 AM yesterday at the Shanghai South Railway Station on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway, Han Chungao, a 60-year-old man from Taixing, was struck by a No. 44 Shanghai-Longhua train from Longhua Station. He fell onto the tracks, and his head was crushed, causing massive bleeding. He was rushed to Shanghai Hospital, but died at 11:00 AM.</p>
<p>Lin Wangshi Swallows Opium. Wangshi, the 37-year-old wife of Lin Benliang from Anhui, argued with a shoemaker named Wang San near the alley entrance. The wife of Zhou, who lived in the rear room, suddenly helped Wang San and accused Wangshi of impropriety. Unable to vent her anger, Wangshi bought a large amount of opium and committed suicide. She died at midnight.</p>
<p>Cai Xinen Hangs Himself. A young and handsome man wearing a Western suit arrived at a certain hotel on Guizhou Road the day before yesterday afternoon. He rented Room 507 from the hotel, claiming to be Cai Xinen, 20 years old, from Suzhou. Unexpectedly, he used his tie to hang himself on the door. The bookkeeper reported to the old patrol station, and the man was sent to Renji Hospital, but died. A book and a copper watch with a 30th anniversary medal of Soochow University were found in the room. No suicide note or other items were found. Yesterday morning, Prosecutor Zhang Junqing arrived to inspect the scene and ordered the body to be collected by the Pushan Villa.</p>
<h3>British Man Kills Tailor in Car Accident</h3>
<p>Li Donglin, a 51-year-old tailor from Ningbo working at the Tongde Mao Shouyi Clothing Store west of the Siming Public Hall on Rue de la République in the French Concession, went out on the evening of the 21st. Around 11:30 PM, he returned to the store. While crossing the street at the intersection of Avenue Edward VII and the Fire Hydrant Lane, he was struck by a private car with license plate number 5002 driven by a British stockbroker named Smith Guan La (transliteration) residing at 3 Xin Kang Road, who was traveling east. Li was unable to avoid the car and was knocked down, suffering a head injury and losing consciousness. The patrol officer rushed to the scene, recorded the car number, and sent the injured man to Renji Hospital. The officer also reported the incident to the patrol station. Li died at around 3:00 AM due to his injuries. The hospital notified the patrol station, which transported the body by car to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch Hall for autopsy. Yesterday morning, the Traffic Department reported to the Second Special District Court, which assigned the chief prosecutor to the scene. The prosecutor confirmed that the deceased died from injuries sustained in the car accident. The deceased's family is still in his hometown and unable to come to Shanghai. Therefore, the shop owner, Wu Fudi, came to claim the body for burial. After questioning the accused Westerner about the circumstances of the accident, the official ordered the body to be handed over to the Tongren Fuyuan Hall for photographing and temporary burial, pending the family's arrival.</p>
<h3>Father-in-Law Chops Son-in-Law</h3>
<p>Probably because he wasn't working</p>
<p>Hou Jianglin, a 23-year-old man from Baoshan, lives with his wife's family at No. 6 Houjia Residence, Qujiaqiao, Jiangwan Road. He works as a laborer at the Kailin Paint Company on the same road. He recently suffered from an eye ailment, with severe redness and swelling. As a result, he stayed home to recuperate and has not been to work for ten days. After dinner last night at 8:00 PM, Hou went to bed due to his unhealed eye ailment. His father-in-law, Xiang Sheng, saw this and became enraged, scolding loudly outside the door. Hou, unable to bear it, retorted. Xiang Sheng, shamed into anger, grabbed a kitchen knife and rushed into the room, hacking at Hou's left neck, causing a wound about an inch deep and profuse bleeding. The Zhabei ambulance rushed him to Tongren Hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3>Shen Wanru Withdraws Case Against Her Husband Li Dingshi</h3>
<p>Ms. Shen Wanru, daughter of Shen Ruilin (also known as Yanyi), the former Austrian envoy, foreign minister, and current director of the China Eastern Railway, previously filed a lawsuit in the Shanghai District Court against her husband Li Dingshi (manager of the Huimin Milk Powder Company) for abandonment and infidelity, demanding a divorce and a lump sum of 105,000 yuan for living expenses. The case was opened several times, but neither party appeared in court, and the case remained unresolved. Details were reported in previous newspapers. It is now known that the case was heard again by Judge He Jingxian yesterday morning. Neither party appeared in court. The plaintiff, Shen Wanru, was represented by lawyer Dong Yu. The defendant, Li Dingshi, was represented by lawyers Jin Yu, Ling Qihong, Chen Qun, and Yan Shihua. Lawyer Dong stated that the plaintiff, Shen Wanru, 27 years old, from Wuxing, Zhejiang, requested the court to withdraw the case to allow her to file another lawsuit. The judge approved the request, and the court adjourned.</p>
<h3>The Case of Confiscated Liquor and Conflict is Withdrawn</h3>
<p>The owner, Dong Yuanhe, of the Qingyong Liquor Store, a wine shop in the French Concession, clashed with police officers from the Second District of the Public Security Bureau and was injured in the altercation. The police department had already returned the confiscated liquor. Dong Yuanhe, due to a sudden change in his injuries, promptly hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit with the Shanghai District Court Prosecutor's Office. The District Court ordered an examination. As both parties were injured, the prosecutor mediated and persuaded Dong Yuanhe to withdraw his lawsuit in court. He then sought treatment at the hospital and has now recovered and been discharged. The incident has been resolved.</p>
<h3>Porter Falls into the River and Drowns</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning at around 1:00 AM, while unloading vegetables from a vegetable boat next to the Jiangtian Wharf in the 16th Shed, a porter named Wang A'gen slipped and fell into the river while walking on a plank. He immediately disappeared. His friends hired a salvage boat to search the area. After about two hours, they recovered his body, but he had already drowned. The body was placed on the pier, and the French Concession patrol station notified the water police, who dispatched investigator Gu Zhikui to the scene. It was determined that the deceased was a 33-year-old man from Wuxi nicknamed "Little Wuxi" residing at No. 4 Rensheng Lane, 16th Shed. A woman named Wang Laosan came forward and identified the deceased as her lover and volunteered to prepare a coffin and burial.</p>
<h3>New Autumn Contribution from Zhendan Company</h3>
<p>Hangzhou Zhendan Silk Weaving Company's recently produced Renmei Crepe is soft and resilient in texture. The patterns were selected by Ms. Wang Renmei. Miss Renmei's screen art has long captured the hearts of the entire modern audience. This time, she represented the perspective of modern women in selecting patterns for Renmei Crepe. The novelty of its style can be imagined. Therefore, Renmei Crepe clothing is seen everywhere on modern ladies. It is said that Zhendan Company said that the sales of Renmei Crepe have broken all previous records of the factory, which shows that the psychology of modern ladies is tending towards "wildcat" styles.</p>
<h3>Brothel Keeper Sentenced</h3>
<p>Zhang Laosan, a brothel keeper from Nanjing who privately opened a brothel in the west wing of No. 4 Dieli Lane, Beijing Road, was recently accused by a prostitute named Teng Xuefang (also known as Aibao) in the First Special Court of forcing her into prostitution and embezzling her jewelry and silver. The case was heard clearly by Judge Liu the day before yesterday afternoon, and he announced that sentencing would be held. This was reported in yesterday's newspaper. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Liu presided over the Second Criminal Court and announced the verdict. Zhang Laosan was sentenced to three months of imprisonment for attempting to profit by enticing a virtuous woman into sexual intercourse with others. Other parts of the charges were acquitted. The associated civil lawsuit was transferred to the court's civil division for trial.</p>
<h3>Jiang Hechun Executes Legal Affairs</h3>

<h3>Kong Yiji and His Environment</h3>
<p>— Wuyou</p>
<p>Regarding Ah Q in "The True Story of Ah Q" (呐喊), some say he is already dead, while others say he is still among us. The debate is widespread and has become a common saying, even for those who specialize in fabricating rumors and attacking Lu Xun. Because Ah Q, as the author said in "How I Started Writing Fiction," "His mouth is in Zhejiang, his face is in Beijing, and his clothes are in Shanxi," is made up of many Chinese bad habits and is inherently universal.</p>
<p>Also in "The True Story of Ah Q" (呐喊), there is a character similar to Ah Q, and that is Kong Yiji. Kong Yiji's characteristics are: first, he is full of classical phrases and quotes (之乎者也), even when talking to children, he says, "Is it much? Not much!" (多乎哉？不多也！). Secondly, he wants to put on a false front. Even though he can only stand and drink with the common laborers, he refuses to take off his long gown, which is dirty and torn and seems to have not been washed or repaired for more than ten years. Thirdly, when he cannot argue with the powerful drinkers and the shopkeeper, he vents his anger on the weak and powerless apprentice and claims competence. This is not much different from Ah Q's spiritual victory method, where he thinks of being beaten as his son beating his father. Kong Yiji, who is lazy and loves to eat (好吃懶做), steals pens, ink, paper, and inkstones when he is hired to copy books. However, he has particularly good credit at the tavern: he wants to share a mere one-penny aniseed snack for drinking with each child; although he is ridiculed everywhere, he takes on the responsibility of teaching the apprentice in the tavern; when he hears people say he is stealing, he blushes and even bursts out with veins to argue, which really makes people feel both angry and funny.</p>
<p>However, Kong Yiji's environment is even more ridiculous. The common laborers and the shopkeeper want to have fun at Kong Yiji's expense. They want to expose his secrets, making him blush with embarrassment. Then they are triumphant and laugh loudly.</p>
<p>Taking pleasure in other people's embarrassment can be said to be anti-empathy! The people of Luzhen (鲁镇), Kong Yiji's environment, are full of this kind of anti-empathy. First, they embarrass Kong Yiji, and then they seek pleasure from his embarrassment. This is how the people of Luzhen live.</p>
<p>Has Kong Yiji and his environment passed away, or do they still exist?</p>
<h3>About Hair</h3>
<p>— Ma Guoliang</p>
<p>Since two or three years ago, I have noticed that the hair on the top of my head has gradually thinned. Every morning when combing my hair, the comb teeth are always caught with long and short hairs, and the amount that falls out when washing my hair is even more surprising. Until now, what was originally a thick handful of hair has only a thin layer left, just enough to cover the scalp. At first glance, it doesn't seem thin at all, but if you try to look carefully, you will feel that the black hair is like a transparent paper, revealing the entire scalp. The phrase "outwardly strong but inwardly weak" (外强中乾) is the most appropriate description of my hair.</p>
<p>The graying and loss of hair are originally symbols of aging. But I can't admit it, because I am indeed still young. I cherish my hair as much as I cherish my youth. Although it is not entirely for aesthetic reasons, I always feel that, as Sinclair said, "It is a bit depressing to go bald before the age of thirty."</p>
<p>So, in order to prevent hair loss, I have indeed used many methods. Starting with rubbing my scalp with brandy, as the barber taught me, I have tried various Chinese and Western hair growth medicines sold in the market, but the result is still failure. Although the instructions for each medicine swear that it is "miraculously effective" (其效如神). Since God doesn't help me, what else can I do! From the perspective of human beauty, hair is indispensable. At least in today's society, whether a woman has hair or not, just like whether she has a pair of eyes or not, directly affects her happiness in life. Fortunately, I am a man, and there is already the invention of the hat for protection, so even if it loses the last strand, it doesn't matter. I only fear that its loss is of no value.</p>
<p>It is said that there are two types of people who are most prone to hair loss. One type is soldiers, because excessive sweat can damage the hair roots. The other type is politicians, scientists, writers, etc., that is, those who overuse their brains. Aside from the fact that soldiers cannot be equated with myself (because I have not even tried strenuous military exercises), the hair that others lose does indeed have its reasons and values for falling out. But I myself am inexplicably losing hair, which seems a bit presumptuous. Einstein contributed great ideas and scholarship to mankind, and at the age of seventy, he still has a thick head of hair; I am only in my twenties, and I have made no contribution to mankind, yet I have lost a lot of hair. Shouldn't I be ashamed to say so?</p>
<p>I am not a thinker, but my hair is falling out like many thinkers, as if I am ignorantly talking about politics while everyone is cursing me, or talking about national construction plans without understanding the reality of history. It is equally unforgivable. I always hope that there is a medicine, or that I will be given a magical elixir by an immortal in my dream, so that I will not be bald in the future and will have the appearance of an ordinary person. Otherwise, since I am ignorant and incompetent, but pretend to be a thinker, if others misunderstand and mistakenly think that I am a thinker, and mistakenly believe my words and go astray, I really cannot bear the guilt. It would be better to quietly return to the group of the ignorant and let the truly wise men with thoughts and knowledge spread their truth, so as not to confuse people's views and hearing. Then, even though I have made no contribution, I am fortunate not to have destroyed anything from it, and I will be very satisfied.</p>
<p>But where can I find a medicine that can really cure hair loss?</p>
<h3>Old Peng's Elegy</h3>
<p>It's been a long time since I received a letter from Old Peng, a little strange!</p>
<p>Just returned from the hospital, there was a letter from Mr. W on the table: (Old Peng's stomach ailment flared up, he was hospitalized, a cut was made in his chest, and a hole was dug under his left rib. Luckily, he got through it.) I felt like an electric current ran through my entire body.</p>
<p>Five minutes before twelve o'clock, the postman delivered a letter from Little Chen: (I went to see Old Peng. The doctor said it would take two weeks to determine [the outcome]...) A dark shadow suddenly appeared before my eyes and slowly grew larger.</p>
<p>A letter from Mr. S finally confirmed the terror I had been harboring: (Old Peng is dead! When I went to see him, he was still sleeping in the hospital morgue...)</p>
<p>I will never receive a letter from Old Peng again!</p>
<p>乂乂乂乂</p>
<p>Old Peng liked soccer. On the First Normal School's soccer field, I competed with him for several years, but we never talked face to face. When we met in Beijing in 1924, we only exchanged a few perfunctory greetings. In 1930, I drifted to Shanghai, and because my stomach was causing panic, I found him again in the editorial department of the Commercial Press. By then, he had already entered the Chinese literary scene, and the name (Peng Jiahua) occupied a small place among the authors. It seemed that he showed warm sympathy for me in my wandering, and so we took a step forward in friendship. The raging winds of the times stirred the passion of many young people on the western shore of the Pacific. Old Peng's works also changed with the times. The cries of the working masses and the anxieties of the youth of the times could be found in his sharp pen and the smile floating on his face covered with a thick, dark beard.</p>
<p>乂乂乂乂</p>
<p>The most profound impression was a scene at 乂乂:</p>
<p>(Old Peng is here too!) Mr. L shouted under the window one day, a bitter smile on his face.</p>
<p>(Ah!) I replied.</p>
<p>The section number was called for Ding. I hurriedly rolled up my bedding and followed Section Ding to another room. The first person to welcome me was him:</p>
<p>(I didn't expect we would meet here again!) He laughed heartily.</p>
<p>He was very happy at that time, not worrying about anything except his rotting foot. He usually just made a fuss about food, joked with his roommates, and sometimes played chess. When he was quiet, he sat cross-legged on the bed and chatted with us. (This is life, too ordinary...) He always burned with the torch of hope.</p>
<p>His will, like his beard, no matter how sharp the razor, would grow out again tomorrow after being shaved off today, and it would be more and harder than before.</p>
<p>He hadn't shaved for a long time at that time, and he really looked like Zhong Kui.</p>
<p>(The wind from the cracks) could not stir up sand and waves after all, so he went from hell back to the human world. But his stomach ailment became more and more severe from then on.</p>
<p>乂乂乂乂</p>
<p>Now he is sleeping peacefully by the Huangpu River. On the remnants of foreign shells lies his long-suffering body. If the soul is truly immortal, perhaps he will still see the arrival of the raging tides on the Pacific Ocean.</p>
<h3>Lunacharsky's Words</h3>
<p>Xu Maoyong (Western, active people, when encountering all kinds of pain, unhappiness, and misfortune, immediately investigate the cause and try to cure it with decisive means. Eastern, passive people, however, poison themselves with anesthetics, or simply immerse themselves in fatalism. The former realistically eliminates the difference in life, while the latter covers their eyes to the difference in life, pretends to be indifferent, and narrows the scope of consciousness.)</p>
<p>Lunacharsky said so. (See "On Art")</p>
<p>(Life difference) refers to all the facts that (always subject life to some restrictions and dangers), that is, (give life obstacles).</p>
<p>The rich have fine wine and women; the poor resign themselves to fate. Today, the scope of consciousness of the Chinese people is so narrow that they don't even think of using active means to maintain their own survival, let alone other things – nation and country!</p>
<p>Looking at Japan, which is also (Eastern), although it is unreasonably violent, it is actually also terrified by the difference in life. However, compared to us, they have taken decisive measures. Aren't all their actions erupting under the slogans of (national crisis) and (extraordinary times)? Of course, in our view, their means are a bit too active.</p>
<p>I don't want to say more. I will still quote a passage from Lunacharsky:</p>
<p>(If a race invades the territory occupied by another race and life becomes difficult, then,</p>
<p>The natives can resist and fight; but they can also be content with peaceful and weak survival, submit to fate, leave their homeland, flee to remote and barren lands, and occupy the position of servants. As a result, they gradually become accustomed to insufficient nutrition and food, and their development can also shrink. (Adapted from Lu Xun's translation) Perhaps future historians will borrow this ready-made passage as the conclusion of Chinese history.</p>
<h3>Stimulation (3)</h3>
<p>— Xie Bingying</p>
<p>An unexpected phone call came. It was from a friend I hadn't seen in seven years since we parted in Wuhan. He came from Guangdong and arrived in Gutian today. He insisted that I go see him. At first, I firmly refused, but later I hesitated a bit because of what he said, such as "the opportunity is rare, and I don't know if we will have a chance to meet again in the future." In this year, my friends are decreasing day by day, and no one knows when anyone will die. It's good to have a chance to meet and talk a few more words while we are alive. Thinking of this, I agreed.</p>
<p>Although I have a horse, it's too hot, and it's not worth it to run twenty li after all. My selfishness is wavering again.</p>
<p>In the end, I decided to go!</p>
<p>It was 2 p.m. Just as I was getting ready to leave, a phone call suddenly came saying that my friend might leave this afternoon, telling me not to go.</p>
<p>So I got annoyed again!</p>
<p>Annoyed, annoyed, annoyed, a thousand times annoyed!</p>
<p>Boom, boom, boom, boom, oh, thunder rumbled, lightning flashed, torrential rain poured down, and a strong wind blew violently. The doors and windows rattled and clattered, the teacups, oil lamps, and teapots on the table rolled to the ground and shattered, and books and newspapers flew all over the room. The torrential rain poured in through the windows, and the whole room was full of water. The rain from the tiled roof soaked the quilts and pillows, and I couldn't even open my eyes. Running out of the room, the raindrops hit my head like iron sheets, causing severe pain, and my clothes were also soaked. The raindrops on my hair fell like beads one by one.</p>
<p>(Oh, no, my books, bedding, and clothes are all wet!)</p>
<p>(Alas! I really didn't expect such a heavy rain. My house is also a mess!)</p>
<p>(You haven't seen it yet, my house is simply like an ocean!)</p>
<p>Hahaha, hearing what they said, I jumped up with joy! Carelessly, my right foot slipped, and I almost fell.</p>
<p>(This rain is really refreshing, now I'm not sad anymore!)</p>
<p>From the moment the storm came, until this moment—9:20 p.m.—my heart is calm, happy, active, and has found endless comfort. (The End)</p>

<h3>A Record of Heroes and Heroines Competing on the Track</h3>
<p>Dong Shuzhao Sets a New National Record in the 800m</p>
<p>Qian Hangsu Overcomes Three Obstacles, but Her Performance is Diminished</p>
<p>Su Xiaoru Wins the 100m on Opening Day</p>
<p>The first event to be decided was the 100m. All eight athletes who qualified for the final were determined to win. Therefore, around 1 o'clock, they all did light exercises around the track to warm up their muscles and bones. When the starter, Jiang Xiangqing, gave the order, the runners each took their positions on the track. The strong athlete, Cheng Jinguang, was too eager to win and rushed out of the starting line before the gun fired, which caused him to be called back by the starter. On the second start, Su Xiaoru had the fastest start, and Hao Chunde had the slowest start. All the way, Su Xiaoru was always in front, and Cheng and Hao were chasing closely behind. When they reached the finish line, Cheng was just a shoulder behind, finishing second, and Hao was another shoulder behind, finishing third. Xue Jianqiu came in fourth. After the race, photographers scrambled to take pictures. Xiaoru had a smiling face and politely greeted everyone with one hand, showing humility and courtesy.</p>
<h3>Shuzhao Sets a New National Record in the 800m. Following the 100m</h3>
<p>The next final was the 800m. There were eight runners at the start. After the gun fired, Dong Shuzhao took the lead and seized the inner lane. In the second lap, Li Yanxiang gradually caught up with considerable strength, only two or three meters behind Dong. Spectators all thought he was Dong's great enemy. In the final straight, the two men took big strides and sprinted towards the finish line. Dong Shuzhao was well-trained and was still able to beat Li Yanxiang by four meters. However, being forced by Li all the way, he opened the throttle to the maximum, and as a result, he was able to break Wang Mingshen's national record of 2 minutes 6.8 seconds with an excellent result of 2 minutes 5.2 seconds, which greatly enhanced the color of men's track and field. Although Li Yanxiang was second, his result was also within 2 minutes 7 seconds, which is also commendable. Dong Jiaxie and Hou Dechong came in third and fourth.</p>
<p>Chen Jiayou Strives in the High Hurdles. Cao Yu gave up the high hurdles final due to the ten-event competition, so only five runners started. Chen Ling started the fastest, and Chen Jiayou was the slowest. By the fourth hurdle, the two Chens cleared the hurdle at the same time. From the sixth hurdle onwards, Chen Ling gradually fell behind. When they reached the finish line, Jiayou won by five or six meters, which was unexpected. Chen Ling finished second, Xiao Dinghua finished third, and Tao Yingjie finished fourth. Wang Huipu was fifth. Unexpectedly, according to the referee's report, Chen Ling and Wang Huipu were both disqualified for knocking down three hurdles. Xiao Dinghua and Tao Yingjie each moved up one place without effort.</p>
<p>Jinguang Regains the Championship in the 200m. Chen Jiayou abandoned the final because he had not recovered his energy after the high hurdles. Therefore, only seven runners started. Cheng Jinguang, learning from his failure in the 100m, dared not relax in the 200m, hoping to make up for it. The others were also scheming to occupy a position. At the start, there were two false starts due to violations, which shows the tension at the time. As a result of the competition, Cheng Jinguang actually got his wish and regained the championship, restoring his position in sprinting. Su Xiaoru was second, and Xue Jianqiu and Dong Yinchu took third and fourth place. Veteran Huang Feilong finished fifth and was out of the running.</p>

<p>Wang Zhenglin's Performance Improves in the 10,000m. Before the start of the 10,000m race, it was known that the championship would go to Wang Zhenglin. It was as easy as turning his hand to win the championship. Yesterday, he maintained a consistent speed throughout the 25 laps from the start, completing the entire course in 35 minutes and 57.5 seconds.</p>
<h3>Eight New National Records for Men and Women</h3>
<p>One Men's Record, Seven Women's Records, One Equal National Record</p>

<p>There was a lot of applause. Chen Xuzhou, after all, is getting older and not as powerful as he used to be. He was able to follow closely behind Zheng Lin in the first ten laps, but after ten laps, he gradually became unsustainable and fell behind. After a struggle, he managed to get second place. Xu Yanbo is physically fit and is a good long-distance runner, but his foot movements are too slow and slightly bouncy, which puts him at a disadvantage. Zhang Quanzhou is too heavy, and it is difficult for him to improve in long-distance running. It is better to switch to other events.</p>
<p>Tao Yingjie Loses Form in the Hurdles. Tao Yingjie could not be optimistic in the hurdles final. This newspaper had already revealed this yesterday, and the result was as expected. Cheng Jinguang took his place, but the result still could not break the 60-second mark, which was not satisfactory. Chen Ling gave up the final for the pole vault. Otherwise, the second-place position would be difficult to say who it belonged to.</p>
<p>Veterans Eliminated in the 400m. The 400m race is one of the most difficult events in track and field. It requires both speed and endurance, so 400m athletes often cannot last long. Guan Changfa, He Debao, and Zhu Ruihong were all known as Shanghai's 400m experts, but unexpectedly, they were all eliminated in yesterday's final, and their positions were taken by new athletes. This shows the abundance of talent. However, I have one suggestion for all the athletes: after the third turn, everyone should proceed in a straight line and should not compete to run in the inner lane to block others. The top three had this problem yesterday and should pay more attention to it in the future. The champion, Zeng Rongzhong, achieved 53.6 seconds, which is not very common.</p>
<p>In the Women's 50m, Ms. Chen Shu, who won first place, is from Xiamen and is lively and loves sports. She has shown her talent in the past two National Games and middle school games. Judging by her physique, she is actually better than Qian Hangsu. However, because she has practiced sports for fewer years, her results are not as outstanding as Qian Hangsu. Li Baohui, who won second place, has developed bad habits in her running posture, which may be difficult to improve in a short time, and it will be difficult for her to achieve better results in the future.</p>
<p>Qian Hangsu Takes the Lead in the Women's 100m. When the women's 100m was about to begin, the sky deliberately made things difficult by increasing the southerly wind, so the results of the competition were not as good as the preliminary rounds the day before. After the gun fired, only Miss Qian Hangsu was seen taking the lead, making the people behind her gradually drift away. When she broke the white line, she was three meters ahead of the second person. Shuqing, Li Yinan, and Li Baohui competed for the second, third, and fourth positions.</p>
<p>Qian Hangsu Wins a Second Victory in the Low Hurdles. Only five athletes participated in the final. Qian Hangsu's victory was expected by everyone. However, due to the headwinds, the results were worse than in the preliminary rounds the day before. Zeng Huiqiong, who finished second, is also a promising talent. If she can continue to train, she will not be inferior to Qian Hangsu in the future. Xiao Jieying, who finished third, and Zhiming, who finished fourth, were at a disadvantage because of their short legs.</p>
<p>Qian Hangsu Overcomes Three Obstacles in the 200m. Six people started running. Watching from the judges' stand at the finish line, it was possible to distinguish each person even though they were 200 meters away, because each person had a special posture. Qian Hangsu was petite and had a fast pace, while Li Yinan was heavy and had a big stride. All the way, except for Qian, who was in the front, the other five people competed fiercely. As a result, Li Yinan won second place, and Zeng Huiqiong and Wang Huachang won third and fourth place. The result was 29.7 seconds, which was not very satisfactory. However, after kneeling down, Qian Hangsu shouted ("My mother!"), because Miss Qian participated in as many as four events. Humans are not made of iron, so how could they not be tired, especially since she is a woman from Fujian?</p>
<h3>A Record of Men's and Women's Field Finals</h3>
<p>Qian Hangsu Breaks the National Record in the Women's Long Jump Again</p>
<p>Chen Rongming Sets a New National Record in the Softball Throw</p>
<p>Fu Baolu Carelessly Loses Jingzhou in the Pole Vault</p>
<p>Other Results are Close to National Records</p>
<p>Yesterday was the last day of the track and field competition. There were a total of seven men's and women's field events. In the women's long jump, the first and second place winners both broke the national record. The champion, Qian Hangsu, jumped 4.88 meters, and the runner-up, Chen Shuqing, jumped 4.80 meters. Chen Rongming also set a new national record in the softball throw with 42.97 meters, which is famous throughout the country. Fu Baolu, who recently unofficially set a national pole vault record of 3.84 meters, failed to officially set a new record yesterday and won the championship with 3.44 meters, which was disappointing. In the subsequent exhibition match, he reached 3.78 meters, barely meeting expectations. Miss Ma Ji won first place in the women's discus with 25.16 meters, which is commendable. It is a pity that there were no official records for comparison before. Other results, such as Hao Chunde's javelin throw of 46.16 meters, Chen Baoqiu's shot put of 12.13 meters, and Pan Chengbin's triple jump of 13.09 meters, were only slightly different from the national records, which is also commendable. The decisive battle is recorded separately as follows:</p>
<h3>Shot Put</h3>
<p>In the men's shot put final, the participants were Chen Baoqiu and six others. During the first week of trial throws, Gong Wanyu took the lead, followed by Chen Baoqiu and Bao Jialiang. The results were all around 11 meters, without anything particularly special. By the second week of trial throws, Gong Wanyu was still in the lead, but there was no improvement in the scores of the other competitors. In the third week of trial throws, Gong Wanyu gritted his teeth and made a powerful throw, exceeding the original record by half a meter. However, Chen Tieniu, not wanting to be outdone, roared and threw the ball to the same distance as Gong. At this point, Gong's score was 11.75 meters, and Chen's score was 11.74 meters. Having entered the final week, Gong and Chen initially did not achieve anything significant. In the fifth throw, Gong achieved 11.82 meters, while Chen at this time achieved 11.13 meters. The distance from the national record was only 0.11 meters, but catching up seemed as difficult as ascending the Shu Road. Gong and Chen both failed in the sixth throw and could only sigh in despair. In the competition for third and fourth places, Bao Jialiang and Liu Jingfeng competed with each other. In the final throw, Bao achieved 11.36 meters. The scores of the top four all broke the previous tournament record of 10.54 meters held by Cao Yu. The scores of the four are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>First Place: Chen Baoqiu 12.13 meters (New Tournament Record)</p>
<p>Second Place: Gong Wanyu 11.82 meters (New Tournament Record)</p>
<p>Third Place: Bao Jialiang 11.36 meters (New Tournament Record)</p>
<p>Fourth Place: Liu Jingfeng 10.69 meters (New Tournament Record)</p>

<h3>Javelin</h3>
<p>There were fourteen participants in the javelin final. Most threw over 40 meters. Hao Chunde was a surprising standout, achieving 46.16 meters in his third throw and winning the championship. Three years ago, Hao was a champion in the national athletics scene. In the previous National Games, he represented the city and won first place in both the long jump and pentathlon. In the past year or so, he had no longer participated in the city's sports events. Many knowledgeable people predicted that his performance had declined and that he did not want to participate. However, Hao's performance in the past two days has been exceptionally good. A few days ago, he won first place in the long jump with 6.62 meters, and yesterday he won first place in the javelin and third place in the 100 meters. His performance has improved significantly compared to three years ago. It can be seen that Hao's ambition has not lagged behind others. The second place, Pan Nanshun, achieved 44.64 meters, and was the champion of the previous National Games. In yesterday's competition, most people predicted that the championship would undoubtedly belong to Pan, but he was surprisingly defeated by Hao. The top three all broke the previous tournament record of 44.07 meters held by Liu Jiayu.</p>
<p>First Place: Hao Chunde 46.16 meters</p>
<p>Second Place: Pan Nanshun 44.66 meters</p>
<p>Third Place: Tang Xianzhou 44.64 meters</p>
<p>Fourth Place: Wang Jihuai 42.98 meters</p>
<h3>Pole Vault</h3>
<p>The highly anticipated pole vault final was held yesterday afternoon at 4 p.m. The participants included Fu Baolu from the Northeast, who is the national record holder (3.54 meters) and the champion of the previous National Games. The spectators who came to the field yesterday all wanted to witness Fu's style and grace. There were a total of eight participants. When the height was raised to 3 meters, several people were gradually eliminated. Those who cleared 3.20 meters included Fu, Cao Yu, Wang He, and Chen Ling. Chen Ling was eliminated at 3.31 meters and finished fourth. Wang He cleared 3.31 meters and finished third. The height was then raised to 3.44 meters, and Fu Baolu and Cao Yu both cleared it. When the height was raised to 3.66 meters, Cao Yu failed three times. At this point, Fu Baolu was very relaxed, believing that his personal best was much higher, so he was still wearing long pants when jumping and did not measure his running steps. As a result, he failed to clear the bar on the first two attempts. On the third attempt, he dashed forward and cleared it, and the whole field burst into applause. However, an unexpected incident occurred: the Boy Scout holding the pole accidentally knocked the crossbar down. Fu failed to clear the bar in three attempts, so the referee ruled it a failure. Subsequently, the referee allowed him to continue jumping, but the record should be officially recorded as 3.44 meters. The subsequent attempts were all considered exhibition performances. Fu then cleared 3.66 meters and then 3.78 meters, showing that Fu's strength is not weak. He should be able to set a new record in the National Games. Fu's accidental encounter yesterday must also be attributed to his personal carelessness. When trying to jump over the height of 3.66 meters, he did not pay much attention to the first two jumps. Only on the third jump did he take off his long pants. Moreover, the pole he used yesterday was also borrowed from Chen Ling, which resulted in him not being able to break the national record, which is a pity. The second place, Cao Yu's score was also 3.44 meters. The old general's prowess is rare. Chen Ling, because he was concentrating on the decathlon, did not compete with all his strength in yesterday's pole vault. The scores of the top two broke the previous tournament record of 3.38 meters held by Li Lin. The top four are recorded below:</p>
<p>First Place: Fu Baolu 3.44 meters (New Tournament Record)</p>
<p>Second Place: Cao Yu 3.44 meters (New Tournament Record)</p>
<p>Third Place: Wang He 3.31 meters</p>
<p>Fourth Place: Chen Ling</p>
<h3>Triple Jump</h3>
<p>The men's triple jump final was the last event of yesterday's finals. The participants included Gu Huo, Wang Yongmin, He Zuxi, Nong Bide, Pan Yongbin and others. Wang Yongmin was originally a strong triple jumper in Shanghai, but unfortunately, his foot injury had not healed yesterday, and he was unable to fully display his talents. As a result, Pan Yongbin (ie, Pan Mian'an) won the championship with 13.09 meters, breaking the previous tournament record of 13.04 meters held by Li Lin, but he was still far from the national record held by Situ Guang. Yesterday, Pan failed to qualify in the javelin final, so he devoted himself to winning the triple jump. In the second jump, he got 13.02 meters, and in the fourth jump, he got 13.09 meters. The other three finalists were not far from 13 meters. The second place, He Zuxi, got 12.54 meters in the fourth jump, which was a regression compared to the Universal Games. Wang Yongmin unfortunately ranked fourth. The high jump champion Gu Huo was selected third. The scores of each person are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>First Place: Pan Chengbin 13.09 meters (New Tournament Record)</p>
<p>Second Place: He Zuxi 12.54 meters</p>
<p>Third Place: Gu Huo 12.44 meters</p>
<p>Fourth Place: Wang Yongmin 12.25 meters</p>
<h3>Women's Discus</h3>
<p>The women's discus is a new track and field event in various countries, and there is no official recognized record in the country. There were twelve participants in this competition yesterday. Among them, only Ma Ji (Zi Jun) was proficient in the correct posture. Ma's turning and releasing of the discus were the best among the competitors, and her arm strength was superior, so she steadily won this championship. Most of the other competitors used a standing throwing method, which shows that many participants are unfamiliar with research and have no proper form to speak of. At the beginning of the throws, the top four all exceeded 20 meters. Ma Ji achieved 24.25 meters in the third throw, and Meng Jian achieved 22.54 meters. After the three trial throws, six people, including Ma Ji, Meng Jianli, Xu Wenying, Sun Zheng, Zhang Sumei, and Wang Huachang, qualified for the final. Ma Zijun rose to 25.16 meters in the fifth throw. Meng Jianli had no achievements in the last three throws. Xu Wenying surpassed Sun Zheng in the sixth throw with a score of 20.54 meters and ranked third. The scores of the top four are as follows:</p>

<p>Third Place: Xu Wenying 20.54 meters</p>
<p>Fourth Place: Sun Zheng 20.32 meters</p>
<h3>Women's Long Jump</h3>
<p>In this final, Ms. Qian Hangsu of East Asia once again broke the record of 4.65 meters held by Hua Mingzhen with 4.88 meters. Qian's running speed, posture, and aerial movements are all excellent. The first jump was 4.40 meters, and the highest record of 4.88 meters was achieved in the second jump. The third jump was 4.50 meters, the fourth jump was 4.87 meters, the fifth jump was a foul, and the sixth jump regressed. Qian's record can be said to be unprecedented in the country. According to her coach, Mr. Dong Chengkang, Qian jumped 5.01 meters in the last school sports meeting. In the National Games, it is expected to break 5 meters again. The second place, Chen Shuqing, has a running speed even faster than Qian. In the first jump, she achieved 4.80 meters, also breaking the national record. However, no special achievements were found in each subsequent trial jump. Chen's pace and steps are not as certain as Qian Hangsu's. Although Qian Chen's results are good this time, they should not be complacent. The record of 4.88 meters is indeed rare in the immature China, but it is still far from the world record of 6.07 meters held by Kinue Hitomi. I hope the women's sports community in our country will work hard. The scores of the top four are recorded below:</p>
<p>First Place: Qian Hangsu 4.88 meters (New National Record)</p>
<p>Second Place: Chen Shuqing 4.80 meters (New National Record)</p>
<p>Third Place: Zou Shande 4.30 meters</p>
<p>Fourth Place: Chen Baixue 4.30 meters</p>
<p>Also, Zou Shande got 4.30 meters in the fourth jump, and Chen Baixue also got 4.30 meters in the third throw. The third and fourth places were decided in the final additional jump. As a result, Zou Shande got 4.20 meters in the seventh jump and ranked third, and Chen Baixue got 4.19 meters and ranked fourth. The official results are still based on each person's 4.30 meters.</p>
<h3>Women's Softball</h3>
<p>As a result of the women's softball throw, the top two broke the national record again. The champion was still Rong Ming, who won first place in the women's javelin the day before. Chen's every trial throw exceeded 40 meters, and the fifth throw exceeded 45 meters. Unfortunately, it was not counted due to a foul. The sixth throw achieved a formal highest record of 42.97 meters. The second place, Zeng Huiqiong, scored 42.83 meters, also breaking the national record, and the distance was only one ball different from Chen. According to the national record, it was 40.395 meters held by Huang Shushun. However, Chen Zeng's results yesterday were not as good as Ding Guimei's 44.80 meters in the Shandong Provincial Games this year and Xin Ruifang's 43.16 meters in the Guangdong Provincial Games. Chen Zeng's records are still good. If they can practice diligently, they will have a chance to score in this year's National Games. The results of the first, second, third, and fourth places are as follows:</p>
<p>First Place: Chen Rongming 42.97 meters (Broke National Record) Second Place: Zeng Zhiqiong 42.83 meters (Broke National Record) Third Place: Gan Hongying 36.44 meters</p>
<p>Fourth Place: Sun Zheng 34.99 meters</p>

<h3>Soccer Semi-Finals: Donghua Narrowly Defeats Youyou</h3>
<p>The result was 3-2, gaining the right to the finals. A successful header by Li Yichen at the very end.</p>
<p>丨Youyou's performance was brilliant and different from the past丨</p>
<p>Yesterday, in the final moment, Li Yichen met Xue Wenxiu's corner kick and headed it into Youyou's goal. The score changed from a 2-2 tie to a 3-2 result, giving them the right to the soccer finals of this year's city games. Tomorrow at 3 pm, they will meet Jinan at the Zhonghua Baseball Field to compete for this year's championship. The main general encountered danger. Feng Yunyou fell ill, and Guan Xun'an was absent, reducing Donghua's strength and shaking the front line. However, they were able to turn from a disadvantaged position into a draw, and ultimately win, which is said to be due to their good fortune, and it is not an exaggeration. The entire military force had a strong left side and a weak right side, and the offense and defense were unbalanced, which almost led to a disaster. The reason lies here. It was the power of three or four special talents that turned the situation around.</p>
<p>Donghua Formation</p>
<p>Mang Jiaju Li Ning Feng Nianhan</p>
<p>Chen Hongguang Tu Kaiyuan Wu Youliang</p>
<p>Wan Xianghua Chen Jiaqiu Li Yichen Zhou Guangzhong Chen Yutian (above) Xue Wenxiu (below)</p>
<p>Performance, good or bad, is also an honor. Speaking of Youyou, it is inevitable to feel sorry. The first half was beyond question. With the wind helping their momentum, they were aggressive. At that time, if they had shot effectively, why would they have only won a penalty kick? Even against the wind, they were able to confront each other. Their forwards advanced in an orderly manner, and their footwork was excellent. The internal personnel were all calm and impeccable. Defeat is not something to dwell on, but it was not due to a lack of effort in the battle.</p>
<p>Youyou Formation</p>
<p>Tang Yongchun Wang Shusen Shi Jinsheng</p>
<p>Ye Jinmian Huang Ruihua Wang Baozhang</p>
<p>Li Shuoyou Sun Jinshun Hu Youcheng Xi Qiaosheng Shen Baigui</p>
<p>Jinshun scored with a penalty kick. Donghua kicked off against the wind.</p>
<p>Before long, Youyou's Li Shuoyou was active on the left flank, and Sun Jinshun led the army to follow, with great momentum. Li Ning showed his infallible header, defusing many dangers. Donghua's Chen Yutian sent two crosses, which were just right, but no one responded. Tang Yongchun came out and caught them, passing safely. Youyou suddenly changed their strategy and switched to attacking from the right. Shen Baigui took the lead and was about to enter the room when Chen Hongguang, eager to save the main general, committed a penalty foul. Sun Jinshun kicked it calmly, scoring a goal in the left corner, taking the lead.</p>
<p>Showing amazing skills, the audience praised. Once the record was opened, the psychology of both sides changed. At that time, Youyou attacked more than defended. Several fierce shots hit the goalkeeper. Sun Jinshun suddenly sneaked into the left flank, dribbled the ball forward, and shot without scoring. The ball went to the middle, where Li Shuoyou happened to be shooting hard at the goal. The goalkeeper Fan caught it with both hands, but suddenly dropped it. The ball rolled backwards, touching the goalpost. This was probably a matter of fate, because if it had moved slightly to the right, Donghua would have lost. With this ball saved, Donghua had a chance to live. In an instant, Wan Xianghua was extremely quiet and thought of moving. He attacked again and again, surrounding Youyou. At this time, a ball suddenly fell from the air. Li Yichen did not have time to turn around, and hooked his foot back. Without anyone knowing, it fell into the goal, making the score 1-1. The remaining five minutes of the first half also ended in the audience's praise and admiration. The victory and defeat changed in the transformation. With the wind helping Donghua, five riders advanced together. Wang Shusen was a little careless, and Zhou Guangzhong turned out in front of him. With an empty goal in sight, he actually shot it obliquely. Afterwards, Youyou launched a large army. Xi Qiaosheng also encountered the same opportunity and could not use it. Then Hu Shen and others also took the opportunity to advance, but their ambitions were not achieved. The ball situation turned, and Wan Xianghua passed it to Li Yichen, then to Xue Wenxiu. Xue shot with all his might, as heavy as a thousand pounds. It hit the goalpost, shaking as if it could not support it. In the midst of Chen Jiaqiu and Shi Jinsheng's struggle, an arm touched the ball, and a penalty was declared. Li Yichen awarded the main penalty, as he wished, Donghua took the lead with 2-1. Youyou's morale did not decline, and they continued to attack. Sun Jinshun confused people's ears and eyes, suddenly moving from left to right. He kicked with his iron leg, and the score became 2-2. Three minutes later, another change occurred. Xue Wenxiu kicked a corner, and Li Yichen's head grew eyes, and he found the ball in the crowd and met it to enter the goal, resulting in a 3-2 result and gaining the right to the final. Referee Shen Huichun, linesmen Liu Chunshu and Chen Guoyi.</p>
<h3>Men's Basketball: Hujiang and Jinan in the Finals</h3>
<p>丨Yesterday's Semi-Finals丨</p>
<p>Hujiang 56-25 Wins Against Xiaguang Jinan 47-39 Wins Against Qianghua</p>
<p>丨Southeast Wins the Women's Basketball Finals丨</p>
<p>The result of last night's men's basketball semi-finals was that Hujiang defeated Xiaguang 52-25, and Jinan defeated Qianghua 47-39, each gaining the right to the finals. In women's basketball, Southeast defeated Chongde 36-21 and will compete with Liangjiang in the finals. The men's and women's groups will compete for the championship tomorrow night. Southeast Wins Against Chongde (Women)</p>
<p>Chongde was respectful in front and then respectful in the back. Chongde's defeat to Southeast was very close in the first half. Although Southeast led all the way, the score was only one or two points apart. The third quarter was the same. In the end, Southeast took the lead and won. Southeast is an all-new army, while Pan Yueying and Lin Shande are veterans. Of them, the center Liao Zhuyuan is the most commendable. Compared with last year in Group B, he can be looked at with new eyes. The coordination is still good, and the shooting is accurate. It can be a little more proficient. Chongde's defense yesterday was tight and strong. Unfortunately, in the first half, the forwards lost many opportunities. The whole team has excellent skills, but the speed is a little slow. The first quarter was 4-3, with Southeast winning by one point. The result of the first half was 12-9. The third quarter was still close, 19-15. In the last quarter, Southeast won by a large margin. The closest score between the two teams was 14-13, with Southeast winning by only one point. The total result was 36-21, with Southeast winning. Referee Shu Hong.</p>

<p>▲Xiaguang Could Not Shoot. In the first five minutes on the stage, Xiaguang was domineering and invincible. Hujiang made a penalty and scored one point to open the record. Xiaguang's Guan Dang'an and Ren Jiexing connected and scored, leading 6-1. Hujiang lost many opportunities under the basket. In the adverse situation, Wu Guolin's long shot opened up the situation. Feng Nianhua also scored an air ball, and Qian Jingyong also added two points, suddenly exceeding 7-6. However, Guan Dang'an once again led 9-7. Wu Guolin once again became equal at 9 points each. The tension in the air was unparalleled for a time. How could I know that in a flash, the situation changed again. Xiaguang lost the opportunity to score in the middle due to their inability to shoot. I don't know how many times they won the ball in their hands, but they couldn't send it in, which was in vain. Long shots and short shots were all against their wishes. Looking back on Hujiang's rise, the momentum was as fast as flying, connecting again and again. The first half ended with 25-13, and the result was 56-25. Referee Shu Hong.</p>

<p>▲Jinan Wins Against Qianghua (Men)</p>
<p>▲Overtime Resolves Victory and Defeat This game was in a tense atmosphere from beginning to end. It was difficult to separate the two teams. At the end of the game, each team scored 39 points, so it was extended by 5 minutes. In these 5 minutes, Jinan scored 3 points and 2 free throws, scoring 8 points in a row. Qianghua did not score a point, so the victory or defeat was decided. Jinan won 47-29. Both sides were panicked and the excitement was greatly reduced. Only the chaos of people and horses kneeling was seen. In the first half, after 11-10, Qianghua suddenly broke through and became 17-10, taking the lead by 7 points. The result of the first half was 24-18, with Qianghua winning by 6 points. At the beginning of the second half, Jinan remained calm and managed to chase back to 26 points each. So the scores of the two teams were equal at times, and sometimes they were 1 point apart, for about 7 or 8 times. When it was 38-38, Qianghua's Wu Youliang made a free throw, making it 39, and the victory or defeat seemed to be decided. Unexpectedly, in the last 10 minutes, Jinan's Wang Weixi also made a free throw, resulting in this situation. Referee Zhou Jiaqi.</p>

<h3>Baseball Game: John Defeats Jiaotong</h3>
<p>▲Due to Darkness, Only Five Innings Played</p>
<p>Result: Seven to Three</p>
<p>The first baseball game was held at Jiaotong University yesterday afternoon at 4:30 PM. The participants were the baseball teams from John's University and Jiaotong University. Mr. Liang, a baseball expert who returned from studying in Japan, along with his brothers, served as umpires, with Chu Cheng-song and Zeng Guangbang as base umpires. The game was originally scheduled for seven innings, but it was stopped after the fifth inning due to darkness. According to the rules, even if the game is stopped after five innings, the result can be determined. Therefore, John's University won with a score of seven to three.</p>
<p>The skills of the two teams were comparable. John's University won because of their composure and fewer errors. The Jiaotong University team included several overseas Chinese students who had recently returned from Honolulu and were quite knowledgeable in baseball. Jiaotong University has a long history of being the champion of Jiangnan University. However, their carelessness and mistakes were frequently seen. In yesterday's game, there was no significant difference in technique; the difference lay in the number of errors made.</p>
<p>John's University started on the offense first. Jiaotong University's pitcher, Wen Liandong, threw four balls in a row several times, filling the bases. He Qionghua then hit a single, and three runners scored, giving John's University an initial lead of three points. When it was Jiaotong University's turn to bat, the first three batters were out in succession, making no progress. In the second inning, John's University did not score. Jiaotong University hit three consecutive singles, and Shen Guanlan and Zhang Jinrong scored two points. In the third inning, Pang Panfang and Zhang Yongxu of John's University scored two more points. Wen Liandong of Jiaotong University hit an extremely far and high ball, which was caught by John's University's center fielder. Afterward, two more batters were struck out, and Jiaotong University scored no points again. In the fourth inning, Li Xuewen of John's University and Zhang Jinrong of Jiaotong University each scored one point. In the fifth inning, Wu Zhenbang replaced Hu Hede of John's University and scored another point. Jiaotong University scored zero points. At this point, it was already dark, and the game was stopped. As a result, John's University won seven to three. ▲Scores by Innings</p>

<h3>▲Track and Field Events Set Eleven New Provincial Records</h3>
<p>丨Mrs. Zhou Fohai Presents Awards at Closing Ceremony丨</p>
<p>(Zhenjiang Correspondence) Yesterday was the final day of the Third Jiangsu Provincial Games. The scorching sun hid, and a golden breeze brought coolness. All events concluded successfully. In the men's division, the Second District and Fourth District each won two championships. However, because the Second District had the highest total score in track and field, it won the overall championship. In the women's division, the Second District won the track and field and volleyball championships, also winning the overall championship. A total of eleven new provincial records were set in track and field, and several were very close to the national records. Outstanding talents such as Jin Zhongkang and Zhang Jiakui will show their skills in the National Games arena. The games lasted for four days. Because those in charge were serious and diligent, and handled matters appropriately, all order was maintained in a structured and orderly manner, and all competitions proceeded smoothly without any disputes. This good phenomenon has truly never occurred in previous games.</p>

<h3>▲Yesterday's Victory over Second District with a Score of Two to One</h3>
<p>Yesterday's tennis final was watched by a large crowd. The four singles players from the Second and Third Districts all had excellent skills. As a result of the competition, the two districts each won one singles match. The championship depended on the doubles match to be decided in the afternoon.</p>
<p>In the first singles match, Zhang Jizeng of the Third District faced Sun Jianqu of the Second District. Sun was the best player in the previous National Games. On that day, he was defeated by Zhang in three straight sets. Sun's skills were not bad, but his performance was unhurried and often lured Zhang to the net, while lofting high balls to the back or taking the opportunity to execute low and fast spin shots, preventing Zhang from returning the shots. Zhang's attitude was extremely calm. Sun's shots lacked control, and there were many errors. The scores of the three sets were as follows:</p>
<p>Third District Zhang Jizeng 6-3 6-3 6-1 Second District Sun Jianqu</p>
<p>In the second singles match, Dai Guangjin of the Third District faced Chen Senrong of the Second District. Chen's serves were fierce, and his smashes were sharp and fast. Dai's returns were weak and powerless, and the ball often hit the net or went out of bounds. He lost the first two sets in a row. In the third set, Dai suddenly rallied, and his net play was miraculous, winning three games in a row. After Chen won one game, Dai won another three games to end the set. Starting from the fourth set, Dai once led with game scores of 3-1 and 4-2. However, Chen frequently attacked with heavy and powerful smashes, which Dai was unable to handle, and he lost three games in a row, allowing Chen to surpass him. At this time, Chen looked calm and composed. Whenever Dai lost a point, he would swing his racket and stomp his feet, revealing impatience and anxiety. The coach beside him told him to calm down. There were three ties in the set, but Chen became more and more courageous as he fought, and his powerful kills were endless. In the end, he won with a score of 10-8.</p>
<p>Second District Chen Senrong 6-3 6-4 1-6 10-8 Third District Dai Guangjin</p>
<p>Since the singles matches were tied, the doubles match was held at 1:00 PM to determine who would win the championship. The players on both sides remained the same. Zhang Jizeng and Dai Guangjin of the Third District had excellent cooperation. Dai played at the net while Zhang guarded the back, with few errors. Sun Jianqu of the Second District made many wild shots, and Chen Senrong, who was known for his serves, often had double faults, committing frequent suicide. In the first set, Zhang and Dai completed five games in one go. After Sun and Chen barely managed to win one game, the Third District won the first set with a score of 6-1. In the second set, the Second District once led with a score of 2-1, but it was only a flash in the pan, and the Third District won several games in a row to win the second set with a score of 6-4. In the final set, Sun and Chen tried their best to attack, but Zhang's returns were like a machine, often returning balls that were difficult to save over the net, making them impeccable. In the final game, Dai made two overhead smashes. Amid enthusiastic applause, they won the championship with a score of three straight sets.</p>

<h3>Seventh District Wins Men's Basketball Championship</h3>
<p>▲Fourth District Suffers a Miserable Defeat with a Score of 14-21</p>
<p>Yesterday morning at 9:00 AM, the Seventh and Fourth Districts had a final showdown in basketball. The referee was Mr. Lu Zhongen, a famous basketball player who had attended the Far Eastern Games. After the center jump, Chen He of the Seventh District received the ball passed from the defense, took three steps, took two steps, and shot with both hands, sending the ball into the basket. Jin and Ma, the two forwards, also scored one after another. Seeing the unfavorable situation, the Fourth District tried hard to counterattack, and Zhou Heming and Yang Yitong started to score. However, the Seventh District had the upper hand, and Chen He's long shots were successful 19 times, increasing the score significantly. The Seventh District led by seven points in the first half.</p>
<p>In the second half, the Fourth District was still in poor form. Although the forwards were brave, they lacked luck with the ball, and they often missed. The Seventh District continued to have smooth sailing, rising steadily, with the greatest lead reaching more than ten points. In the last five minutes, the famous player Qian Dingshen was troubled. He broke through the siege and scored several times in a row, bringing the score closer. However, time was not on their side, and they suffered a miserable defeat with a difference of five points.</p>
<p>Overall, the Seventh District was known for its average talent and fast teamwork. The Fourth District's individual techniques had reached a good level, but their cooperation seemed to be slightly lacking. Yu Jinxiang's shooting was inaccurate, and Qian Dingshen seemed to be playing with an illness in the first half. Chen Hefang's long shots and close receptions were seamless. Jin Youde was tall and lively, truly a good player. Overall, the skills of the two teams were comparable, and the victory depended on fate rather than a lack of skill.</p>

The second singles match was between Xue Qifeng of the First District and Yang Yunying of the Third District. Wang's skills were refined, and her shots were stable. Xue was tall and had excellent overhead smashes. The skills of the two players from the Third District were far apart, and they were at a loss. As a result, the two singles players from the First District won all the matches without much effort. The doubles match was not played because it did not affect the outcome. The First District won the women's tennis championship in this session. The scores are as follows:</p>

<h3>Fourth District Wins Women's Basketball Championship</h3>
<p>▲Victory over Third District with a Score of 32-9</p>
<p>After the fierce battle in the men's basketball game ended, the women's soldiers from the Third and Fourth Districts continued to take the stage. The scene of fierce competition transformed into a garden of singing birds and dancing swallows. Miss Huang from the Fourth District was no less skilled than the men in throwing, blocking, and intercepting. The three players in the back were good at guarding and followed the opponents closely, not leaving them for even an inch. Just one minute after the start of the game, Huang Shimao opened the scoring. Huang Lianzhen from the Third District also scored a basket. Then, the defender from the Fourth District committed a foul while Miss Huang was throwing the ball. Miss Huang scored two points from the free throw and one point from the penalty. This was the peak period of the Third District. After that, the competition between the two sides became intense, and there were excellent performances from time to time. At the end of the first quarter, the Third District was only one point behind. However, at the start of the second quarter, the Third District suddenly collapsed. The two Miss Huangs and Zhangs from the Fourth District were like butterflies fluttering among the flowers, finding their way around freely and everywhere. The forwards from the Third District could not find a way to attack, and the enemy camp remained the same as it was in the first quarter. It was not until the end of the game that the forward Huang scored two points. As a result, the Fourth District won the championship happily with a score of 32-9.</p>
<h3>Three Relay Races Won</h3>

<p>▲Men's 1600 Meters: Sixth District</p>
<p>▲Women's 400 Meters: Second District</p>
<p>▲Men's 400-Meter Race Because there were few participants in the men's 400-meter preliminary, it was changed to a final and held at 2:20 PM. The participants were the six districts of Fourth, Third, Sixth, Fifth, Seventh, and Twelfth. In the first leg, Gu Yongyi of the Sixth District arrived first, followed by Qian Dabang of the Third District, and then Zhao Congsun of the Fourth District. In the second leg, Gu Ningxian of the Fourth District took the lead, Qiu Kexiu of the Third District fell behind, and the Twelfth District also caught up from behind.

<p>▲Men's 1600 Meters The men's 1600-meter relay preliminary</p>
<p>was scheduled for 9:00 AM on the fourth morning. It was held in two groups. Because the number of participating districts decreased temporarily, the preliminary was canceled, and the final was held at 1:20 PM. The participants included the four districts of Third, Sixth, Eleventh, Twelfth, Fourth, and Seventh. Each district had four people, and each person ran 400 meters. After the order was given, Zhao Zengxi of the Sixth District took the lead, and Ji Jinjiang of the Fourth District followed closely behind. The Sixth District was in the lead, and the Fourth District was second. In the final 400 meters, Lu Yaxiong of the Sixth District took over, and Wu Zijing of the Fourth District took over. Lu and Wu were both famous players, and they both ran bravely forward. Lu Yaxiong took the achievements of the first three people and arrived at the finish line first. Although Wu Zijing had a good result, the Sixth District was already 50 meters ahead in the first 1200 meters, and no matter how hard he struggled, it was difficult to take the lead, so he had to settle for second place. The names of the people in each district are listed below.</p>
<p>Result: First (Sixth District), Second (Fourth District), Third (Third District), Fourth (Seventh District), Result: 4 minutes 2.8 seconds.</p>
<p>▲Women's 400 Meters The women's 400-meter relay race, the final event of the track and field competition, included the five districts of Twelfth, Seventh, Fourth, Third, and Second. The runners from the First District only came to the venue as spectators and did not enter the track to draw lots. It was determined that the Twelfth District would run on the innermost track, and the Second District would run on the outermost track. After the start, the Fourth District arrived first, followed by the Third District, and then the Second District. However, Wu Juxin of the Second District quickly took over the baton, and in an instant, she surpassed the Fourth District. By the third leg, it was level again, and it was difficult to tell who was better. Zhu Baizhi received the fourth baton and buried her head, rushing out of the crowd and advancing with the team's speed. When she reached the finish line, she threw the second place seven or eight meters away. The results are as follows: (1) Second District, (2) Third District, (3) Fourth District, (5) Fifth District, Result: 1 minute 4 seconds 6.</p>

<p>Special Fashion Issue</p>
<h3>The Beauty of Fashion by Su Feng</h3>
<p>No modern woman dislikes fashion. However, generally speaking, under the (presumed) circumstances, what we see as so-called fashion is often very poor. Not only is it lacking in aesthetics, but the materials and color schemes are also flawed.</p>
<p>Because of the general mindset, people only seek (1) high prices; (2) imported products. They pay no attention to other essential conditions such as (1) how to coordinate colors, (2) how to tailor... and so on. Thus, fashion as fashion is merely a display of wealth and does not represent a love of beauty!</p>
<p>I believe that the beauty of fashion is not determined by economic conditions. Therefore, those who create fashion should never choose based on (whether the price is high).</p>
<p>As for (Chinese people using Chinese goods,) this is an inevitable principle, and the use of domestic silk and satin for fashion goes without saying.</p>
<h3>Standard Western-Style Women's Clothing Cutting Method</h3>
<p>By Yi Xiang</p>
<p>Regarding the cutting of Western-style women's clothing, I have already discussed it in detail in the previous issue of this publication. However, I mentioned the proportion of the front and back body measurements, but I did not have time to describe how to arrange the limbs. Now, I will redraw the front and back body and provide diagrams as shown on the left to perfectly match the 39-inch bust measurement in the previous issue as a standard cuff. Readers should follow the diagram and research it in detail, and there will be no discrepancies. However, this only shows the standard; how to make changes still depends on each individual's comprehension. Dogmatically adhering to fixed rules is not advisable. If you follow the instructions, explore the source, and develop your own style, you will surely achieve mastery. ▲ Body Diagram Example</p>
<p>The cutting dimensions, if done according to the diagram on the right, should be as listed in the table on the left, with almost no variation, to obtain accurate results. (The person in the diagram is entering the bay... The place represents the widening pull)</p>
<p>22｜｜31…… Seven and three-quarters inches</p>
<p>22｜｜33…… Seven inches</p>
<p>22｜｜24…… One and three-quarters inches</p>
<p>22｜｜23…… Two and a half inches</p>
<p>33｜｜25…… Five inches</p>
<p>24｜｜31…… Five and three-quarters inches</p>
<p>23｜｜33…… Four and a half inches</p>
<p>26｜｜27…… Five inches</p>
<p>28｜｜29…… Two inches</p>
<p>30｜｜32…… Five and a half inches</p>
<p>▲ Sleeve Diagram Convenience</p>
<p>The cutting of sleeves is also extremely important. If the dimensions are slightly off, the entire effort will be wasted even if the body is cut properly. Therefore, you should cut according to the following dimensions.</p>
<p>34｜｜35…… One inch</p>
<p>36｜｜37…… One inch</p>

<h3>The Best Materials for Preparing Winter Clothes</h3>
<p>By Fu</p>
<p>| Zhanghua's Domestic Woolen Fabric |</p>
<p>The autumn wind suddenly rises, scattering the backbone that has surrounded us for months, and we return to a cool realm. In such a refreshing environment, we suddenly think of the cold and harsh winter that will arrive soon, and we cannot help but shudder before it even begins. We remember the ancient saying "prepare for rain" and learn from the warning of "digging a well when thirsty." We should take advantage of this mild season to prepare some winter clothes. As soon as we talk about making winter clothes, we inevitably think of the need for woolen fabrics, because woolen fabrics are truly the best material for winter clothes. They are soft, warm, close-fitting, and can keep out the cold. They have the warmth of cotton, but cotton does not have their timeliness and beauty. However, what makes people hesitate and ponder is that people seem to think that (woolen fabrics) are imported foreign goods, and they believe that even if there are so-called domestic goods on the market, they are unreliable and incomplete. This kind of thinking is naturally unavoidable. Because we know that weaving woolen fabrics is China's newest industry. In the past, we did not know that wool could be woven into clothing. Since Europe shipped in woolen fabrics, Chinese people have competed to buy them, and the demand has surged, so some merchants have come to operate this industry. However, weaving woolen fabrics is not a simple matter. The process of weaving woolen fabrics is truly very troublesome. First, we must remove the impurities from the important raw material, wool. Then, it must be washed, combed, analyzed, and so on before it can be loaded onto a weaving machine. After that, it must go through the work of repairing, finishing, dyeing, and flattening before the woolen fabric can be made. The various machines required for such complex work cannot naturally be purchased by small operators. Therefore, for the sake of convenience, those woolen fabric merchants simply wholesale ready-made woolen fabrics from foreign countries, change their appearance, and advertise them as (domestic goods). Some of the more honest ones also wholesale woolen fabrics from foreign countries and go through their own dyeing and coloring procedures, and then they are considered (domestic goods). The better ones at least purchase their raw materials from countries such as England, Germany, and Belgium. Therefore, it is no wonder that Chinese people suspect that the woolen fabrics on the market are all (unreliable) (incomplete) domestic goods or even (foreign goods).</p>
<p>However, this suspicion was finally broken by the facts contributed by the Zhanghua Domestic Woolen Fabric Factory, which was established in 1929 and is now developing.</p>
<p>The Zhanghua Domestic Woolen Fabric Factory, with its substantial capital of one million, hired hundreds of skilled male and female workers and equipped itself with all the machines needed for the woolen fabric weaving process. Not only does it not rely on foreigners for dyeing and coloring, but also washing and weaving are done by the factory itself. Not only does it wash and repair itself, but also its wool raw materials are mostly obtained from areas such as western Zhejiang and Shandong, such as Huzhou and Caozhou. In this way, the products of the Zhanghua Factory, which weaves, spins, and dyes itself, can be said to be (reliable) (thorough) and completely authentic domestic goods, right? Who says that (domestic) woolen fabrics in the domestic market are (unreliable)? However, what are the products of the Zhanghua Factory like? According to tests by the Shanghai Social Affairs Bureau, they said that (firmness and durability) and elasticity are superior to imported products. As for the detailed situation, you can see the samples displayed at the factory's retail store on Nanjing Road, so I don't need to go on about it.</p>
<p>In short, in this (Domestic Goods Year), when the domestic economy is declining and industries are sluggish, the national people should encourage and support a factory that is striving to operate domestic goods.</p>
<p>(2) Autumn-style Fabric Patterns (6)</p>
<h3>Changes in Silk Fabric Patterns</h3>
<p>▲ Advancing with the Times by Ms. Chuan Mei</p>
<p>The patterns of silk fabrics in our country have historically changed very little. Luxurious items are mainly based on dragons and phoenixes, supplemented by qilin and cranes; elegant items are mostly based on plum blossoms, orchids, bamboo, and chrysanthemums, supplemented by return patterns and auspicious characters. Although their positions and sizes may have slight changes, and their colors and designs may have slight differences, their overall structure does not deviate from the above-mentioned principles, remaining the same for decades. The silk and satin left by grandmothers can still be worn by granddaughters without being criticized for being out of date. Large families often wrap silk and satin around spools and store them in chests, just like storing gold and silver jewelry. Towards the end of the Qing Dynasty, European styles gradually spread eastward, and foreign silk and satin were imported from time to time. As a result, the patterns of silk fabrics were influenced and began to change. However, the change was still slow, and its scope was not wide. In four or five years, only one or two different phenomena were slightly presented. Only those who study them very carefully can distinguish them. Until the founding of the Republic of China, imported goods increased day by day, and our country's electric silk weaving factories rose in response. As a result, the patterns of silk fabrics changed again. Sometimes it was flowers, sometimes it was birds and animals, sometimes it was people. The changes were many, and the replacements were rapid. In one or two years, they became outdated. In the past four or five years, printed silk and satin have become popular, and the process of change is even faster. After three-dimensional patterns were imported from Europe and the United States, they were immediately utilized and became popular in our country's silk fabrics. Last autumn and this spring, diagonal stripes were fashionable. Whether printed or woven, diagonal stripes were the most fashionable, sweeping the country for a time. Modern ladies all wore a piece of clothing made of it. In dance halls, movie theaters, and even on the streets, they could be seen everywhere. It was truly a grand sight for a while! But since the beginning of summer this year, this trend has declined again, and straight stripes and checks have risen in popularity. Willow crepe and willow georgette, checkered crepe, and checkered georgette all sell well. This autumn, the wind is refreshing, and new styles are rising in popularity. Recently, the Meiya Silk Weaving Factory and Sincere Company jointly held a fashion show and a large exhibition of silk crepe, with a dazzling array of beautiful products. More than a hundred kinds of new circle patterns for the twenty-second autumn style were seen, including large circles, linked circles, double-locked circles, full-ground circles, clear-ground circles, virtual-dot circles, horizontal-line circles, etc., all with unique designs and novel structures. Made into modern new dresses, suitable for both plump and slim figures, they were refreshing to the eye. More than 70,000 feet were sold at the event. Judging from this situation, it can be said to represent the standard of this season's patterns. It is said that the circle patterns were obtained by the factory after offering a generous reward for submissions, selected from more than 3,000 entries by famous artists Liu Haisu and Jiang Xiaozhao. Their vision is indeed superior, with patterns that truly represent the times. Studying the patterns of silk fabrics in the world, Paris, France, is the authority. Every spring and autumn, new styles are released, and major silk and fashion companies hold grand exhibitions. Silk merchants from all over the world send representatives to inspect everything and bring them back to their countries as the standard of the times. Noble ladies all regard them as the norm and wear them uniformly, considering it an honor. However, our country lags behind in everything. Even with regard to this pattern, we cannot be included internationally, which is truly shameful. Although it is due to the fact that our country's women's clothing is different from that of Western countries and cannot be generalized, at least in the spring and autumn of each year, our country must also have new patterns released to represent the standard of the times, so that modern ladies have a basis for reference, and then the clothing industry can make progress from time to time, showing the art of the East and avoiding falling behind others. I believe that pioneers in the silk industry, such as the Meiya Silk Weaving Factory, should raise funds to hire artists to conduct research at any time and release new patterns in the spring and autumn of each year to represent the standard of an era, in order to promote the progress of silk and give our declining silk industry a glimmer of hope!

<h3>The Look of an Evening Dress</h3>
<p>The quality and color of clothes are a matter worth discussing. Today, in this period of national crisis when everyone is rejecting imported goods and vigorously promoting domestic products, domestic goods are indeed much more vigorous than before. However, the tailoring and style of clothing cannot be ignored. The current popular fashion is only adopting and imitating the style; it is not necessary to use foreign materials to make it. For example, wearing a new dress to participate in a grand banquet or social occasion is more luxurious and grand than a cheongsam. The style of this evening dress is Western, but the material is made of Meiya's new silk crepe. This kind of fabric is stronger than gauze but not as heavy as silk, making it most suitable for the autumn season, and it has a double-width selvage, making it most suitable for making new clothes. The factory has been carefully studying women's clothing recently. If ladies have any difficult and unsolvable problems regarding style, they can contact the factory for assistance, and they will surely be taken care of.</p>
<p>Representatives inspect everything and bring them back to their countries to serve as the standard of the times. Noble ladies all regard them as the norm and wear them uniformly, considering it an honor. However, our country lags behind in everything. Even with regard to this pattern, we cannot be included internationally, which is truly shameful. Although it is due to the fact that our country's women's clothing is different from that of Western countries and cannot be generalized, at least in the spring and autumn of each year, our country must also have new patterns released to represent the standard of the times, so that modern ladies have a basis for reference, and then the clothing industry can make progress from time to time, showing the art of the East and avoiding falling behind others. I believe that pioneers in the silk industry, such as the Meiya Silk Weaving Factory, should raise funds to hire artists to conduct research at any time and release new patterns in the spring and autumn of each year to represent the standard of an era, in order to promote the progress of silk and give our declining silk industry a glimmer of hope!</p>
<h3>Fashion Consultant</h3>
<p>Recently, women's clothing styles have been changing frequently, and colors and patterns are also changing daily. However, each person's age, physique, and environment are different, so the tailoring of the style and the coordination of colors are of great research value, especially in relation to climate, season, and the occasion of wearing. Generally, scholars entrust this responsibility to ordinary tailor shops, which often leads to numerous errors and regrets. This publication has specially set up a (Fashion Consultant Department) to serve women. Those who have questions about the above-mentioned matters can send letters to P.O. Box 1796, Shanghai Post Office. A detailed reply will be provided for the reference of those who inquire and for easy adoption. Readers are requested to pay attention.</p>
<h3>The New Look of Ancient Garments - Fan Yanqiao</h3>
<p>Among the attire of ancient women, there are styles that are still applicable today. What differs is merely the length, width, and fit. Examples include:</p>
<p>▲ **Gui** (also known as "Zhu Yu").) *Biography of the Empresses*: "Clothing made entirely of green Zhu Yu." Commentary: "That is, the Da Ye garment, similar to the Gui garment of today." In modern terms, it is like an outer jacket worn on top. Back then, red edges were also used, suggesting a delicate and beautiful look. Also, *Inner Biography of Emperor Wu of Han*: "The Queen Mother's female attendants wore Gui made of blue silk, their eyes sparkling and their appearance pure and radiant." So, garments made of silk differed somewhat from today's versions, which are often made of wool or flannel. One emphasizes its flowing elegance, while the other prioritizes temperature regulation. However, a newly popular style of small silk shawls emerging in late summer and early autumn bears some resemblance to it.</p>
<p>▲ **Yu** Also seen in *Inner Biography of Emperor Wu of Han*: "The Queen Mother sat facing east in the hall, wearing a golden Da, its patterns bright, its radiance refined and serene." *Shi Ming* says: "Connected. The upper and lower parts of the clothing are connected." In modern terms, this is Western attire. Young women wear it a lot in the summer. Newlyweds especially like this style of clothing. However, it is not as luxurious as the Queen Mother's.</p>
<p>▲ **Daodun** *Fang Yan* states: "Large trousers are called Daodun." Also, *Biography of Zhu Bo*: "Former subordinates of the meritorious Cao Guan wore Da Zhao in winter." Commentary: "A large skirt and trousers." In modern terms, this refers to the large, bright, and vibrant trousers that can be seen underneath a woman's cheongsam. However, in the past, when women wore skirts, the size of the trousers was not noticed. Presumably, the terms "Daodun" and "Da Zhao" referred to men's clothing.</p>
<p>▲ **Reversed Clothing** Nowadays, women like to wear fur jackets inside out, but this is not an ancient style. *Biography of Kuang Heng in the Book of Han*: "To be rich and noble but not praised by scholars is like having a fox fur coat and wearing it inside out." Wearing clothing inside out is not honorable. Also, *Xin Xu* states: "Marquis Wen of Wei went on an excursion and saw a firewood carrier wearing a fur coat. He asked him. The reply was: 'I love the fur.' Marquis Wen said: 'If you don't know how to wrap it well, the fur will have nothing to rely on.'" This also opposes wearing clothing inside out. In the late Qing dynasty, high officials would wear fur coats inside out to show their high rank and the splendor of their clothing. Western women also have this intention. Chinese women imitate them, but in reality, they have lost the original purpose of keeping warm.</p>

<p>Practical Resistance and Capacitance Slide Rule</p>
<p>— Ming Xiang</p>
<p>When we are testing and designing electrical machinery, we often encounter the problem of calculating the total value of multiple resistors in parallel or multiple capacitors in series. The usual method of calculation is nothing more than using the following formula: Although the solution of this formula is not very complicated, it also takes up a lot of valuable time. Those who are not familiar with algebra will find it particularly difficult. However, by using the slide rule in this article, there is no need to use formulas, and there is no need for troublesome solutions. A very simple addition can quickly and accurately solve it.</p>
<p>The ruler is divided into two grids, A and B. The A number is a decimal less than one, and the B number is an integer greater than one. The A number is read from right to left, and the B number is read from left to right. The range of calculation of this ruler can be unlimited. For the sake of clarity, only ooi</p>
<p>丨丨Ｉooo o is noted. The method of reasoning is clear at a glance to the reader. For example, if the A number is pushed to oooi, the B number should be iooooo</p>
<p>When calculating, you must pay attention to whether the units of each number are the same. If they are different, they must be converted to the same unit before calculation. Now let's try a few examples to illustrate the calculation method of this ruler:</p>
<p>Example 1: Three capacitors are connected in series, and their capacitances are .oo3, .oo4, , oo5mf, find the total capacitance.</p>
<p>First find the .oo3 in the third row of A number. The corresponding value of B number in the third row of B number is 333. The B number of 004 is considered to be 250, and .005 is 200 (if the A number is in the second row, the corresponding value of the B number should also be taken in the second row. The rest are the same), the sum of each corresponding value is 333+250+200=783, and then find the B number 783, the corresponding value of its A number is .oo128, which is the answer.</p>
<p>Example 2: Four resistors are connected in parallel, and their resistances are 500, 650, 800, 1000 ohms. Find the total resistance. The corresponding value of A number obtained from these four numbers on the ruler is .002, .00154, .00125, .001, the sum of these four corresponding values is .00579, and then check A number 00579, the corresponding value of B is 172, that is, the total resistance is 17z ohms.</p>
<p>From the above examples, the calculation steps can be divided into three, first distinguish whether each calculated object is an A number or a B number, such as A number, find the corresponding value of B number on the ruler, and vice versa, then add the corresponding values together, and then find the corresponding value of the sum on the ruler, which is the final answer.</p>
<p>For this type of slide rule, readers who have not used it before may feel a little difficult when using it for the first time, but after a few trials, they will find it very convenient, which can really save us a lot of mental time.</p>
<h3>Adjustment Method and Steps of Shortwave Transmitter (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Luo Jingyu</p>
<p>Now we begin to discuss the adjustment steps of the regenerative oscillator transmitter.</p>
<p>(1) First remove the plate voltage of each stage, and set all plate-grid capacitances to zero degrees.</p>
<p>(2) Make the oscillator oscillate. The method is the same as described in the single oscillator transmitter, and the adjustment can be carried out in the same way. If it is a crystal type, the adjustment procedure is even simpler: because the circuit of the crystal type is generally a plate-grid resonance, and the wavelength of the crystal itself is fixed and unchanged: therefore, the drop point (that is, the standard point for the best oscillation situation) is the easiest to find.</p>
<p>(3) After the oscillator is adjusted, we should start the adjustment work of the amplifier stages. This step is the most troublesome and annoying in the regenerative oscillator. Because the purpose of the amplifier is to expand the original frequency, the external voltage must form an oscillating circuit in its grid circuit. And the output is definitely taken from the plate, so the plate circuit also forms an oscillating circuit. When these two oscillating circuits are calibrated to the same wavelength, that is, when its oscillating current reaches the maximum value, just like the plate-grid harmonic correction circuit, the plate current returns to the grid by means of the capacitance effect inside the vacuum tube. And this amplification stage loses its amplification purpose and oscillates. In order to remedy this defect, a kind of phase current is added to prevent the plate current from returning to the grid. The amplitude of this added reverse current must be equal to the returning current, and the phase difference between the two phases is 180 degrees. The purpose is to make the two cancel each other out, so that the plate and grid circuits can reach a state of mutual non-interference. As for the octave device after the crystal generates oscillation. Because the structure is similar to that of an amplifier, each stage must still be balanced. However, the wavelengths of its plate circuit and grid circuit are usually not calibrated to be the same. Therefore, a slightly inaccurate balance. It is also difficult to generate oscillations on its own. As for the simple principle and method of balance, the following is also described in passing. Figure 6A is the balance circuit of the Shanghai International Radio Station Fenglin Bridge transmitter. Cn in the figure is the balance capacitor. For the sake of structural simplicity, its balance coil is half of the oscillating coil. Regarding the theory of the balance circuit, it is easy to understand if we explain it with Figure 6B. In the figure, Cn = Cgp, Ln=lp. If there is a current returning from G through Cgp at this time, then Cn also has a reverse current applied to the grid at the same time, so that the opposing forces on both sides cancel each other out.

<h3>Winding Steel Wire and Brass Wire into Springs</h3>
<p>— Shu Dian</p>
<p>First burn the steel wire red to make it cool by itself, and its properties will soften. Then wind it into a spiral shape, then burn it red, and immediately throw it into cool water, and its elasticity will recover by itself. If it is brass wire, its properties are just the opposite. Immediately throw it into cold water after burning it red, and it will soften. After burning it red again, wait for it to cool by itself, and its elasticity will recover.</p>
<h3>Ground Wire Material - Scale Rod</h3>
<p>The ground wire needs to be buried in a low and humid place for good effect. However, most common metals have chemical reactions with water, and will corrode after a long time. Now I will tell readers to try a ground wire material with excellent effect and durability.</p>
<p>Take the dry battery after it is used up, take out the carbon rod in the center, and use it as a ground wire. It is not limited to one, the more the better. The place to be buried is also not limited to one place. The lead-in wire is clamped tightly on the screw at the end of the rod. It is best to bury each strip separately, and connect the lead-in wires together and use one wire to lead to the place where it is used.</p>
<p>This ground wire does not corrode and is not easy to dry out. Because sulfurous carbon can absorb moisture to make the vicinity moist. Moreover, it is waste utilization, which can be said to be an economical and durable ground wire.</p>
<h3>Domestic and Foreign News</h3>
<p>Broadcasting and Aviation During this time, the Italian flying team, under the leadership of its Minister of Aviation, General Balbo, completed its great feat of flying 24 aircraft to the United States as a team. It is said that each aircraft is equipped with a Philips shortwave radio receiver, so that it can communicate with its headquarters in Rome from time to time. The use of Philips radios in Italian aircraft is not a one-time event. A few years ago, General Balbo's flight to South America was also equipped with Philips radios.</p>

<h3>A Message to Men</h3>
<p>— Ms. Yin Xian</p>
<p>Recently, this publication had an article by Mr. Shen Yan, "A Message to Women." The words were earnest and touching. This article is written in response.</p>
<p>Men! You are the darlings of thousands of years! Your freedom, your authority, needless to say: among the sisterhood, you have priority in everything. Let's just talk about your spouses, are they not slaves raised by you? Whipping, insulting, abandoning, is there anything that is not carried out according to your wishes? In these times, you are envious of the superficial aspects of European and American customs, and sometimes help women by holding their coats and carrying their things. This is originally your way of showing off. How much real benefit is there for women? And you think that women are gaining face, and you are deeply afraid that if this continues, (one day men will be reversed and shout the slogan of equality). How petty and worried is this!</p>
<p>Let's talk about women's professions. Although it is said that small positions in agencies, schools, companies, etc. can allow one or two women to insert their feet, you think that it has a (struggle for life) with you. China is so big, production is so backward, foreign capitalism is so developed in the country, and domestic warlords are so rampant. Why don't you, as upright men, develop undeveloped industries, exclude foreign capitalists, and overthrow corrupt warlords and bureaucrats? Instead of starting from these big things, you are arguing with women about jobs, thinking that women have taken your positions, thinking that (this makes people who raise three or four boys at home complain all day long). How short-sighted, timid, and unenterprising is this?</p>
<p>As for the mutual jealousy and exclusion among women, it is indeed a weakness of women themselves. However, is it not the male society that creates the environment and terror that uses this weakness to make women perform tragic scenes? Vain and self-degrading women associate with married men, intending to steal the love of others. If the man who is being stolen is a perfect gentleman, how can he easily give his love to such a frivolous and weak-willed woman? Moreover, since the revolution, there have been countless events of men abandoning the old and welcoming the new, deceiving and insulting their wives, from revolutionary leaders, party and state dignitaries, to merchants and students. This situation has become a trend. If you want to remedy it, on the women's side, they should realize that they should not covet material enjoyment and harm the same sex. On the men's side, they should also act with conscience and have some humanitarian concepts, so that they can achieve the coexistence and co-prosperity of both sexes!</p>
<h3>*Three Character Classic*</h3>
<p>— Yan Qiao</p>
<p>The *Three Character Classic* is said to be written by Wang Bohou, a Confucian scholar of the Song Dynasty. People in the Ming and Qing Dynasties have made additions and revisions. Now Mr. Zhang Yantai has re-revised it and published it by the Suzhou Guoxue Association. He said: (Today's textbooks are far inferior to the *Three Character Classic*.) From the perspective of scholars, it is certainly like cats barking and dogs jumping, how can it be compared to the *Three Character Classic*, which includes everything from names to events. However, from the perspective of educational principles and the physical and mental development of children, how can a *Three Character Classic* make children of six or seven years old memorize it? If you still use the teaching methods of the past, seeking to (suddenly understand it one day) would be too unmodern. I also recited this book in the school. At that time, I used hard work to memorize it by rote, and recited it like singing folk songs. In fact, I still knew nothing. Now I also know that the content of this book is very rich. Among the four elementary books (*San Bai Qian Shen*), it is indeed the best. It can be seen that this book still requires a certain level to be worthy of reading it. As for the *Thousand Character Classic*, it is full of allusions and more difficult to understand than the *Elementary Learning*. In my opinion, it is not advisable to use it as extracurricular reading in the year of elementary school graduation, because some people do not have the ability to enter middle school and have to find a job urgently. If they do not have the opportunity to study, reading this *Three Character Classic* will give them a little common sense and be very beneficial.</p>
<p>From the experience of my children, I feel that the educational efficiency from kindergarten to elementary school graduation is very significant, far beyond what the school can compare. When it comes to middle school, progress is greatly slowed down due to the large number of subjects. Therefore, if we want to improve education, we still have to study at the middle school level. Since Mr. Zhang has already thought about this, why not compile some reading materials for middle school students? Isn't it more meaningful than improving the *Three Character Classic*?</p>
<p>Speaking of middle school reading materials, I think of comic books that are regarded as treasures by elementary school students. When they come back from school, they always have one in their hands. However, the contents are all romances and ballads, the paintings are crude, the explanations are incomprehensible, and what is especially terrible is the remaining poison of feudal ideas, which deeply penetrates the clean and fragile little brains. The lessons learned in school all day long are completely replaced by it. It seems that the education authorities, who can pay attention to details, think that this thing is insignificant. In fact, it is better to spend a lot of money and edit some teaching materials and compete for profit with booksellers, than to compile some low-level reading materials and distribute them to the people like missionaries selling Gospels. On the one hand, we should ban bad reading materials, which is a complete training.</p>
<h3>Nothing to Talk About</h3>
<p>— Tai Jiu</p>
<p>In life, one probably often feels the boredom of having nothing to talk about. For example, in a social occasion, you meet an acquaintance, ask for their name, and then what do you say? But you can't help but say something, so you have to perfunctorily talk about the weather, saying things like (the weather is really nice today). Or, for acquaintances you barely know, you might say something like (the weather is really nice), (you've been busy lately)? It wouldn't do to ignore them, but there's nothing to talk about, so you're stuck saying stuff like (you've been busy lately). Brits and Americans always say things like "Good morning" and "How are you?" It's said to be proper etiquette, but it's awfully boring. This shows that in life, one often feels the boredom of having nothing to talk about.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, humans can talk, and unfortunately, lots of things happen in the world. So, there should be plenty to talk about. Why bother with empty chatter? But that's not true. Events fall into two types: big and small. Big events can be divided into two: those that affect you personally, and national affairs. Of course, personal matters like jobs and love are only discussed when the time is right. As for national affairs, Confucius set the rules (don't meddle in things outside your position) and (it's a crime for someone of low status to speak out). Who dares to defy the sage's teachings and speak freely? As for small things, like (the neighbor's house was robbed last night), that seems too trivial and might not be polite, so you just don't talk about it. For these reasons, you end up with nothing to talk about. So in life, you just end up talking about the weather and whether you've been busy.</p>
<h3>Evening Scene</h3>
<p>— Yi Fan</p>
<p>On the way home: the small steamer left the city moat and entered the wide river where the Yi River meets: The ga, ga, ... of the engine drove away a flock of thousands of ducks, struggling desperately forward. Swimming also seems to be a struggle for survival.</p>
<p>On the distant bank, there were four or five, four or five bare-legged, bare-chested boatmen, pulling a rope forward with half their bodies. A rope tied to the mast of a clumsy boat, but they didn't sing any boatmen's songs. Otherwise, I would have suspected that I was on the Volga River.</p>
<p>The river, the wide, flat river in the distance, without wind or waves, was so flat that it seemed flatter than an asphalt road, if you could drive a car on it. With a slight breeze, it looked like a cobblestone road. But I have never walked such a flat road, and there seems to be no such grand avenue in the world, right?</p>
<p>A little further away from the city, but still able to see the high chimneys of factories and the high layers of pagodas of ancient temples: smoke was coming out of the chimneys and there was a venting sound at the same time.</p>
<p>The sun was running towards the back of the green mountains, and the reflected light illuminated the entire ship and the entire Henan, perhaps the entire world. There were more than fifty, more than fifty men, women, old and young, on the bank. They were carrying bamboo baskets, lunch boxes... walking forward quickly. The golden sunset shone on their entire bodies, and they seemed to be well-nourished. They were talking and laughing, as if they were very happy. This is not the first time, and even in two days, you can see a group of them holding umbrellas, showing only dozens of legs moving.</p>
<p>Is it the collapse of the rural economy, or the development of urban factories?</p>
<p>Thousands of poor farmers rushed to the factories in the city, and as a result, they were spit out by the factories and went to the graves. They seemed to be going through such a process and embellishing an evening scene on the bank.</p>
<h3>The Fourth Company Commander of the Northeast</h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Fifteen: Guests Leave, Shy, Tender Feelings Surge; Visitors Come, Old Grievances and Bad News Bring Sorrow</p>
<p>Ji Zhi: No, let's sit outside, the view is wider. He found a seat facing out, with a few weeping willows in front, a patch of green wheat field, interspersed with a few villages in the distance. It had been a long time since he had been to the countryside, and it was quite interesting to look at. The waiter first poured a pot of tea and put it on the table, and said with a smile: You can drink a pot first. After saying that, he poured him a cup of tea, crossed his hands, stood aside and looked at him, smiling: You are getting fatter. In the past six months, I think you are more successful. Your job is very good, right? Ji Zhi smiled and said: Job? I do hard labor just like you. I rely on my skills to make a living. But what you said about being happy is true. I don't get angry at anyone else. This job was introduced by a company commander named Zhao Ziqiang. I am very grateful to him, but I don't know which battalion or company he is in, how can I find him? The waiter smiled and said: The Company Commander Zhao you mentioned, we have a regular here, a company commander surnamed Zhao, but I don't know if it is the person you are talking about? Ji Zhi said: He has a family and lives in Haidian. He speaks with a Baofu accent. The waiter said: That's right. You order some dishes and wait for him while drinking wine. Maybe he will pass by here in a while. Ji Zhi then ordered two dishes and four ounces of wine, and slowly ate and drank. At this time, it was only 10 o'clock in the morning, and the people eating lunch had not yet come. The waiter was also very idle here. While he was serving the dishes, Ji Zhi talked to him again, and said: Does this surnamed Zhao often come to your place to eat? The waiter said: They have food in the battalion. It costs more to eat out, why would they do that? Unless they are in a good mood, they will come here to patronize once or twice. (194)</p>

<h3>Financial Stocks, Commodity Prices, Silver Futures Plunge; Gold Price Continues to Rise: Four Yuan, One Jiao</h3>
<p>▲Frequent Reports of Increasing Cotton Prices, Rise Repeatedly Thwarted</p>
<p>Yesterday, the gold market saw a general decline in overseas silver prices from England and America. Exchange rates saw the British and American exchange rates drop by 2.5 fen, the American and British rates by 875, the British and French rates by a small 7 fen, and the American and French rates rise by 0.5 fen. The forward silver price on the metal exchange fell by between 6 and 8.5 li. Stocks fell by 5 yuan, 5 jiao, 3 fen. American cotton rose to 43 pounds per sound. American wheat fell by 5 fen. However, the price of raw gold in London fell by one shilling, and new American mined gold also fell to 31.33, from a previous price of 32.28. Although the opening price was slightly higher, it was not very firm. Although it rose later, it still fell. After the opening, the exchange market was relatively loose. Reuters reported that the U.S. government is considering a plan to fix the dollar price to give it strong purchasing power. This did not have much impact. Later, there were sudden reports that the U.S. president had ordered the government to allocate $75 million to buy up various surplus agricultural products, and the price fell. Then, there was news that the president would approve a request to purchase half of the existing surplus American cotton. The situation in the morning market was difficult to stabilize, and gradually retreated to 80 yuan. The noon closing was still flat. The afternoon market opened and plunged, mainly because the domestic market trended looser and there was much selling. Overseas news reported that the expansionary policy would be difficult to implement, and people's hearts were calmed. Afterwards, dealers aggressively bought American dollars, and the banks' selling appetite became sluggish. The gold price then rebounded sharply. The market situation for the day was mediocre, and various news reports lacked major impact. The raw gold price was 1,100 yuan. The market situation for the day is recorded below:</p>
<p>The morning opening was 783.5 yuan, slightly up 2.4 yuan from the previous closing. The item price opened at 3.6 jiao. The exchange market opened with near-term selling prices of British exchange at 1 shilling, 2 pence, 1875, and American exchange at 30.25 yuan.

Zhifeng, Yongheng, Yu Dakang, Bingxing, and others sold in succession, and the price dropped to around 3 yuan. Mitsui bid for December at 8125 and 875. Yuan Mao, Yongheng, Yu Zhifeng, and Yong Geng sold down to 1 yuan. HSBC announced that the British rate was flat and the American rate down 125. Qian Changxiang, Bingxing, Fuyu, Zhaofengchang, and others frequently sold, and the price hovered and rose to over 3 yuan. However, the January American dollars at 125 were difficult to sell. Fuchang, Hengyu, Bingxing, Changsheng, Yongrui, Kang, and others sold in succession, and the price fell to within 1 yuan. Maijia Li and Citibank bid for October American dollars at 375. Yuanchun, Daxing, and Yong Shunli sold, and the price fell to 79.3 yuan. Pan Gen bid for January American dollars at 1875. Yuansheng, Yong Zhaofengchang bought, and the price rose back to 81.9 yuan.

<p>The afternoon market opened at 779.8 yuan, and the item price opened at 9.6 jiao. The January American dollars at 1875 were difficult to sell. Ruikang, Hengyu, Shunli, and Hengxing sold in succession, and the price fell from 0.3 jiao to 77.1 yuan. The bank did a swap for November at 75, which was slightly flat. Fuyu, Hengyu, Bingxing, and others bought and the price rose back, but mostly hovered. Daxing, Yong Zhaofengchang, Yuanmao Yong also bought. Mitsui bid for December American dollars at 0.5 yuan, and the price rose to 81.5 yuan. Citibank bid for October American dollars at 4375. Zhifeng Yong sold, and the price retreated to 0.2 jiao. After that, dealers tried hard to bid. Hua Bi bought October American dollars at 375, but the January American dollars at 125 were difficult to settle. Hengyu, Fushun, Yuanmao Yong, Fuyu Hengtai, Zhifeng Yong, and others all bought, and the price rose to 83.5 yuan. The item price was sold and fell slightly. However, because the domestic market was tight and people's hearts were stable, retail investors aggressively bid. Ruikang, Cuitai, Fuyu, and others all bought, and the price rose to 5.7 jiao. Pan Gen bid for December American dollars at 75 and the price fell slightly. After hovering, the closing price was 785.2 yuan, and the item price was auctioned at 5 yuan. The highest price during the day was 785.7 yuan, and the lowest was 777.1 yuan, a difference of 8.6 yuan. As a result, the price continued to rise by 4.1 yuan compared to the previous closing.</p>
<p>The listed price was 800 yuan due to HSBC's American exchange rate being reduced by 125 to 30 yuan. According to the closing price, it was about 15 yuan weaker, down half a yuan from the previous closing. The registration price for this month was 794 yuan, for October 788 yuan, and for November 780 yuan. The morning makeup water was 794 yuan, and the afternoon makeup water was 799 yuan.

There are still 1,568 strips left for this month, and 1,617 strips for October.</p>
<p>Trading in the market was mediocre.

Hengtai, Hengchang Yong, Fuyu Changsheng Yong, etc. first sold and then bought. The Dalian guild and Wanxing did a total of nearly 1,900, settling over 300 strips. Shunli did a total of over 2,500 strips, settling over 300 strips. The Guangdong guild and Hengxing bought less than 100 strips and sold over 200 strips. As of the previous day, there were a total of 23,954 November chips.</p>

The market trended firmer. Overseas news was also not favorable. HSBC announced that the British rate was flat and the American rate down 125. Although it was loose when announced, it was still flat. It remained firm afterwards. The afternoon market opened quite loose. Afterwards, banks took advantage of the cheap prices to do swaps. Buyers were still diligent, and gradually turned flat. Finally, Chinese merchants suddenly bid strongly, and the process tightened.

<h3>Foreign Short-term Loan Rate Increased by One Fen</h3>

The morning and noon markets were the same. Short-term bill transactions in the morning market were over 4.8 million for transfers and over 600,000 for new transactions. Transactions in the noon market were over 400,000, and transactions in the small general meeting were over 600,000. Because the head position was again excessive, no one accepted it, resulting in no water being added and white lines being opened, which was looser than the previous day. Foreign mortgage transactions involved redemption of over 500,000, and new loans of over 600,000. Banknote receipt and delivery was over 1.3 million, and issuance was over 1.45 million.

<h3>Securities</h3>
<p>Bulls Exit, Bond Market Declines</p>
<p>丨Rumors of '96 Reorganization' Are Completely Unreliable丨</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange saw market prices rise slightly, but the situation in North China failed to be resolved smoothly. Furthermore, although the public bond market did not rise sharply, it had been good for several days in a row. Bulls took the opportunity to exit at high prices, and market prices failed to stabilize, with the trend appearing weak again. According to the market this month, most cases involved selling immediately after a slight rise and buying immediately after a slight fall, indicating that people are indecisive and lack definite opinions. As for the rumors of '96 reorganization,' reports indicate they are completely unreliable, either fabricated by the bulls or equal to catching shadows. The talk of issuing new public bonds has not been confirmed to this day. The rumors were initially stated with certainty, but now they cannot even justify themselves. This matter is of great importance and cannot be clarified in a short period. When the market opened yesterday morning, it was chaotic, with most declines outweighing the rises. Salt tax was down by a small 0.15 jiao, and gold short-term and long-term were down by a small 0.35 jiao, with the trend being quite soft. Bulls exited the market, and swap transactions were also lively. In the second session, there were more sellers than buyers, with bulls doing swaps. Four and Sixteen had quite a bit of selling, with prices down by 0.1 jiao to 0.25 jiao. Only gold short-term rebounded slightly by 0.1 jiao. The two sessions in the afternoon were still chaotic and uncertain, with rises and falls varying depending on the different swaps by bulls and bears. Relatively, there were more rises than falls, but the amount was only 0.05 to 0.1 jiao. As a result, market prices fell by 0.05 to 0.23 jiao. There may not be a drastic change before the settlement period this month. The total number of transactions was 7,467,000 yuan, including 7,000 yuan in spot goods, 2,655,000 in total salt tax futures, 700,500 in troop reduction, 975,000 in 19 Customs Revenue Surplus, 1,470,000 in 20 Customs Revenue Surplus, 835,000 in 96 bonds, and the rest ranging from tens of thousands to two or three hundred thousand.</p>
<h3>New York Stock Market Downturn Continues</h3>
<p>Xinfeng Foreign Company reported that on the 21st, the New York stock market saw securities decline by 6 yuan, and commodities were also weak. The reason for the decline was that the enthusiasm for inflation encountered frustration, and transactions tended towards short selling. Because there were large-scale loss-limiting transactions, the market tomorrow seems promising. The total number of transactions for the day was 3,650,000 shares. Wheat fell sharply due to bulls closing out positions, with limited buyers, and most households were also hesitant. The market should have a sharp recovery. Cotton opened weakly because the Liverpool market price reported lower, and the development of inflation gradually disappeared. Later, although there were rumors of limiting the decline in wheat prices, and Russia and France would have large-scale purchases, and the strength of the lost gold pound, it failed to reverse the cotton market situation. The market throughout the day was extremely chaotic and uncertain. Spot goods needed were quite good, and export news was loose. The silver market situation closely followed exchange rates for transfer, which was very uncertain. The Dow Jones Index is listed below:</p>
<p>Closing Price　Compared to Previous Day</p>
<p>30 Industrial Stocks　97.56　Down 5.53</p>
<p>20 Railroad Stocks　42.85　Down 4.01</p>
<p>20 Utility Stocks　25.84　Down 1.10</p>
<p>40 Bonds　　83.68　Down 0.79</p>
<h3>Yarn and Flower Manufacturers Maintain Standard Yarn Prices</h3>
<p>丨Due to Several Days of Continuous Decline丨</p>
<p>The yarn market was weak in the morning and firm in the afternoon. American cotton continued to fall, but the local market rose instead. Because it had been falling for many days, and a certain factory made efforts to absorb a huge amount, the trading floor was cleared out by it. General scattered shorts, seeing the market situation slightly tight, developed the intention to close out positions. As a result, the market turned upward. However, practically speaking, current yarn consumption is inevitably affected.</p>
<h3>Human Cotton Marker Firm and Popular</h3>
<p>The human cotton marker opened in the morning with American cotton being sluggish, with each month falling by 1, 2, 3 jiao. The afternoon opening was still flat. As the auction reached the closing, the market atmosphere was slightly tight, and retail investors covered their short positions. Each month rose by 7, 8, 9 jiao to 1.2, 3 jiao. The total number of transactions for the day was 25,000 bales. Mingde sold 1,400 bales, Yuanda 900 bales, Dachang 1,200 bales, Dafeng 1,300 bales, and Changfeng 1,300 bales. Lichang bought 1,350 bales, Dafeng 1,000 bales, Yuanda 1,450 bales, and Yu 950 bales. The closing prices are as follows:</p>

<h3>Yarn Sales Stagnant</h3>
<p>The current yarn sales market is still flat. The total amount bought by various guilds for the day was 492 bales. The market situation was similar to the previous day. The amount bought by each guild is as follows: Fujian 5 Inland 195 Fellow Traders 15 Ningbo 32 Jiangxi 20 Shantou 5 Guangdong 100 Luzhou 10 Hankou 100 Zhenjiang 10</p>
<h3>Amidst the Declining Sound of American Cotton, Standard Flower Still Maintains a Calm and Steady Attitude</h3>
<p>American cotton continued to fall by more than 40 pounds per sound, but the local cotton market remained calm, and buyers' intentions were quite strong. Because the arrival of goods from various routes has not been very enthusiastic, the wind and tide disaster has greatly affected the cotton-producing areas, so people's hearts are increasingly tight. However, a certain manufacturer, due to the sluggish yarn price, uniquely dumped at high prices in October, and the market atmosphere was flattened by it. However, the spot cotton business has not seen a major upturn. The overseas cotton market is mediocre. According to a certain cotton company, the Tianjin cotton market has fallen by more than one yuan.</p>
<h3>Zheng Cotton Marker Buyers' Eyes Look Optimistic</h3>
<p>The Zheng cotton marker opened in the morning, being sluggish due to the decline in foreign cotton, with each month falling by 0.1 jiao. In the afternoon, the weather changed again, and the market atmosphere was especially tight, with each month rising by 0.15 jiao. Major households still sold in October. The total number of transactions for the day was 98,100 dan. Suilong sold 6,900 dan, Gengfeng 3,100 dan, Yuanda 3,800 dan, Yuanxingchang 4,900 dan, Yichang 6,300 dan, and Xincheng 6,300 dan. Jifeng bought 4,100 dan, Tongji 4,800 dan, Chunji 3,000 dan, Taixing 5,600 dan, Yiyu 3,200 dan, and Xinheng 2,700 dan. The closing prices are as follows:</p>

<h3>Raw Cotton Factory Needs Are Fragmented and Seem Busy</h3>
<p>The current need for cotton is still good. Source statistics are 4,500 bales of Yao cotton and 1,500 bales of Tongzhou cotton. The current cotton opening prices are as follows:</p>

<h3>American Cotton Continues to Fall by Over 40 Pounds per Sound</h3>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton was extremely weak due to the weakness of Wall Street, with bulls closing out positions and the public selling. As a result, spot goods fell by 40 pounds per sound, and futures fell by 40 to 47 pounds per sound. The Liverpool cotton market saw spot goods fall by 9 points and futures fall by 90 points. Egyptian cotton saw spot goods fall by 10 points. The Bombay cotton market initially followed the weakness of American cotton and then rose due to short covering, and then fell again due to Japanese trading. As a result, Pingle fell by 6 rupees, Omla fell by 4.5 rupees, and Bai Luoxi fell by 4 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (21st telegram): American Cotton Compared to Previous Day Combined National Currency English Cotton Compared to Previous Day Combined National</p>

<h3>Grain and Flour Market Still Looks Bleak</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market unanimously fell without stopping. Because foreign wheat quotes in Chicago continued to fall by about 1.7 yuan, and Canadian wheat fell by 0.6 yuan. Therefore, after the opening price, the overall market atmosphere was not much revived. Due to the stagnation of actual sales and the abundance of factory stocks, the local area had surpluses, and other areas felt the social recession, so the spirit and vitality of people's hearts were not without reason. When the market opened in the afternoon, the market atmosphere was still unstable. This month's lowest actually reached 2.165 yuan, a record never seen before, not far from the prediction of 0.15 yuan. As for the factory side, there were still hedging transactions, and the customer side only had a few transactions. Based on the environmental speculation, the subsequent steps are still seen as bleak. As a result, this month fell by another 0.0125 yuan compared to the previous day, October fell by 0.02 yuan, November fell by 0.01 yuan, December fell by 0.0075 yuan, January fell by 0.005 yuan, and February fell by 0.01 yuan.</p>
<h3>Forward Wheat Market Has Short Covering</h3>
<p>Yesterday's forward wheat market, after opening in the morning, showed a state of decline in each month. Because foreign wheat quotes in Chicago were down by a small 1.7 yuan, and Canadian wheat was down by a small 0.6 yuan. After the opening price, people's hearts were flat, but there were few sellers, and the decline was not much. Each month was only smaller than the previous day by 0.01, 0.02, 0.03 yuan. By the time the market opened in the afternoon, this month, due to sellers switching to hedging October, and distant months having short covering, the market atmosphere seemed firm. If inland guilds have hedging sales, it should be seen as flat and bleak. As a result, this month was down by a small 0.01 yuan, November was unchanged, December was good by 0.01 yuan, and January was good by 0.02 yuan. The current wheat market situation is still active, and prices show a firm trend. The opening price for Taierzhuang wheat was 3.94 yuan, Wuhe wheat was 3.92 yuan, Yaowan wheat was 3.9 yuan, followed by 3.8 yuan, Mingguang wheat was 3.89 yuan, followed by 3.81 yuan, Gaoyou wheat was 3.75 yuan, followed by 3.58 yuan, Danyang wheat was 3.6 yuan, followed by 3.57 yuan. Fufeng took 8,000 bags, Shenda took 3,000 bags, and Xinda took 1,500 bags.</p>
<h3>New Top-quality Rice Sales Are Active, Prices Rise Slightly</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) There were more than 20 sources, with the same number of retail and wholesale sellers as before, totaling over 1,000 bags of japonica top-quality rice. The situation was tighter than before due to the limited sources. Although the market situation was once made active by sellers, it only had a few fen of improvement due to the lack of firm confidence, and was still in a state of stability with tightness. According to market statistics, the prices of thick japonica, indica rice, and aged Duyang top-quality rice from various guilds were all unchanged. Only the new top-quality rice from various guilds was quite popular due to active transactions, and prices rose slightly. The new fragrant japonica rice from Hexia was also strong and outstanding due to its scarcity. Xie Yin Yuan was flat. (North Shanghai) Yesterday, there were about 27 or 28 sources from Hexia guilds. Sales of various goods in the market were still good. The market shape of high-grade broken japonica was firm, and the prices of medium and low-grade broken japonica, West New japonica, New Yang Duto, and Baijiao tip, as well as port tips, increased slightly. The prices of Chen Yang Duto tip and guest tips followed the rise by several fen. Thin indica rice stood firm. Dong New japonica was stable.</p>
<h3>Yong Guild Actively Deals in Foreign Guest Indica Rice</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Min guest rice and Hua rice were both popular, and the Guangdong guild also tried to deal in them. The market atmosphere was very good, and prices rose by 0.1 or 0.2 jiao. The entanglement between Hongxingcheng and Xiangmao Foreign Company over foreign rice has been resolved, and the suspended foreign rice can be sold. Among them, 36,000 bags of Jia Late Chen coarse rice were directly dealt with by the Yong guild for 23,000 bags, with a price of 5.5 yuan. The Yong guild's appetite was very strong. In addition to this batch of foreign rice, 440 bags of Jiangxi machine late rice were also traded in the market, with a price of 7.85 yuan to 7.7 yuan. 203 bags of Jiangbei machine rice were priced at 7.15 yuan to 7 yuan. 500 bags of Nanjing aged rice were priced at 6.75 yuan to 6.05 yuan. 700 bags of Kunshan Yang top-quality rice were priced at 7.45 yuan to 7.3 yuan. The Min guild already had boat space. Yesterday, the trading was also active. Because Guangzhou levied foreign rice taxes, the Guangdong guild also inquired about Hunan rice, and a total of 1,807 bags of Hunan coarse rice were opened, which were divided up by Min and Yue, with a price of 5.9 yuan to 5.7 yuan. The Min guild also took 200 bags of Wuxi New indica rice, with a price of 6.95 yuan. The market was very active yesterday. Except for foreign rice and mid-to-low-grade indica rice, it rose in unison. If the current Min guest rice and Hua rice become popular again, the market may still rise. Moreover, Beiyang and Guangdong-Guangxi have directly loaded goods from Wuhu, Xianghan, and other ports. Furthermore, the local foreign rice reserves are decreasing day by day. If they are not allocated, the people's hearts and the market will have a turnaround.</p>
<h3>Nanjing New Cowpeas Listed</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the first batch of Nanjing New White Cowpeas appeared on the market, totaling two loads, 110 bags. The arriving goods were of good quality and color. Among them, 40 bags of large peas were priced at 4.65 yuan and were dealt with by the Shantou guild. 70 bags of small peas were sold for 4.2 yuan and were taken by the Guangdong guild. The market shape is temporarily seen as flat. Therefore, this kind of fancy goods is difficult to become a mainstream market and relies entirely on buying and selling.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Raw and White Sugar Prices Rise with Customs Gold Rate</h3>
<p>| Already Opened at $21.80 |</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market saw continued increases in the customs gold rate, strengthening the trend. The guild set the price for 24 raw white sugar, high-grade common "WO" mark, at $21.80, with over a hundred bags traded. The price for common-grade was also called at the same price but no deal was made. No. 20 medium white sugar was called up by $0.20 to $21.20. Taikoo Sugar "B" mark was priced at $21.75, up $0.15 from the previous day (20th). China National and Guohua refined white sugar rose by $0.30 compared to the 20th, with top-grade at $20.95, No. 1 at $20.75, No. 2 at $20.55, No. 3 at $20.35, and No. 4 at $20.15. Chaozhou green sugar opened with a few hundred bags, with the best Gaohuanggang green at $15.90, and the next grade at $14.80. Over two hundred cases of boxed Gaopian green sugar were sold, priced at $12.80. Dutch red "PK" mark was at $16.65, up $0.05 from the previous day.</p>
<h3>Metal and Bamboo Joint Steel Bars Soar</h3>
<p>Bamboo joint steel bars have recently seen strong demand due to limited arrivals, leading to a supply shortage. Prices have soared, reaching $110 per ton. If specific types are requested, the price increases by $1-2. It is reported that Qingdao and Fuzhou merchants have been actively purchasing in recent days, and local construction companies have also been trading, resulting in a very favorable market and expectations for further price increases.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: The Future of the Silk Market Remains Bleak</h3>
<p>(Zonghua Silk Shipped to England and India) The British mail ship "Naldera" exported a total of 408 bales of yellow and white silk, including 130 bales of yellow and white spun silk for transshipment to India, shipped by Jardine Matheson and Samsung, among others.</p>
<p>(European and American Telegrams Indicate Further Decline in Silk Prices) The New York raw silk market is experiencing weak prices due to competitive selling by hoarders and sluggish factory demand. Sales in Lyon remain stagnant, and telegrams indicate further declines in silk prices. European and American firms in Shanghai are considering taking advantage of the situation to lower prices and replenish their stock. Chinese silk merchants, citing significant losses, are hesitant to sell. Yesterday, only Roulston, Lepack &amp; Co., and Tongyun issued large batches of silk telegrams, with no reports of spot silk transactions.</p>
<h3>Fine Quality Green Tea Transactions Booming</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the tea market in Shanghai saw robust trading of fine quality green tea from Tunxi, Shexian, and Suian. British firms such as Jardine Matheson, Tongfu, and Jinlong all made bulk purchases. Local firms also experienced increased activity in fine quality green tea sales. The total transaction volume reached over 1,300 chests, indicating exceptionally strong demand. Top-grade hand-picked tea from Tunxi was priced at $200 per chest, while common-grade tea ranged from $104 to $117 per chest. Tea from Shexian and Suian were priced around $80 per chest, showing a slight increase compared to previous levels. However, sales of fine quality green tea from Wuyuan remained sluggish, and there were no significant transactions for needle tea and show tea.</p>

<h3>What is (Air Mail Remittance)?</h3>
<p>What is Air Mail Remittance? It is placing the silver note or draft into an envelope, then securing it, and mailing it via airplane to the destination. This method of remittance is called Air Mail Remittance.</p>
<p>Air Mail Remittance is a new type of remittance service. It is both fast and reliable, and it holds an important place in the remittance business. (Currently, air routes are not long, so some legs may still require ordinary postal service.) Its speed is sometimes comparable to telegraphic transfers, and its security is the same as other voucher remittances. It allows for verification of handwriting and stamps on the draft stub. It combines the advantages of both telegraphic transfers and voucher remittances, making it popular with the general public, especially for those who urgently need funds or fear mistakes. In today's economic downturn, it meets the needs of the masses.</p>
<p>The term (Air Mail Remittance) has only recently appeared frequently in newspapers and books. Five years ago, the Air Mail Remittance business did not exist in our market, and the new term (Air Mail Remittance) was rarely seen. Because Air Mail Remittance relies on airplane delivery, just as telegraphic transfers rely on telegraphs. The aviation industry has only developed recently, so the Air Mail Remittance business and term have also emerged recently.</p>
<p>Air Mail Remittance business started in Europe and America not long ago. It has only been four years and two months since we started this business in China. I remember when the Shanghai-Chengdu air route started on July 8th, 1929 during the establishment of airmail service by the Ministry of Transportation. I was among the first to try this Air Mail Remittance innovation due to my interest in stamp collecting. This was originally launched by the postal service. Only recently have I seen several banks following suit in Shenbao advertisements, indicating the potential for the necessary development of this business.</p>
<p>What is Air Mail Remittance? Many merchants are asking each other with suspicion. That is why I have given a lengthy explanation.</p>

<h3>A Comparison of Two Events Guanghan</h3>
<p>The sensational May 15th Incident in Japan, which shook the world, was finally judged yesterday after several interrogations by the military court. The perpetrators, including Eihan Goto and eleven others, were sentenced to four years of penal servitude each. Comparing this Japanese event, we are reminded of another incident in China: the Assassination Squad incident, which has also been clearly judged by the court. Liu Chongwu and several others were each sentenced to seven years of penal servitude.</p>
<p>Let's compare these two events.</p>
<p>The May 15th Incident in Japan was a conspiracy by military personnel to assassinate Prime Minister Inukai Tsuyoshi, a major upheaval that shook the world. The seriousness of the case and the gravity of the charges are self-evident, but the outcome of the trial was only a four-year sentence. Looking back at the Assassination Squad incident in China, although it was also an act of transgression in the eyes of the law, the motivation and circumstances behind the crime stemmed from patriotic fervor and was a patriotic movement. However, the final verdict was a heavy sentence of seven years of penal servitude.</p>
<p>One event in Japan, one event in China. Killing the head of state of a country for power and profit results in only four years of imprisonment; eliminating despicable and treacherous villains for the sake of the nation and its people results in seven years of imprisonment. What else is there to say?</p>
<p>It is said that after the verdict of the May 15th Incident, the Japanese Fascist Party, while outwardly strongly claiming innocence, was actually quite satisfied. Only the Proletarian Party was strongly protesting the injustice, believing that compared to labor union movements, the legal punishments received by Japanese citizens were vastly different. I say that the Japanese Proletarian Party is too ignorant of current affairs and too ungrateful. Don't they see our country? Not long ago, wasn't a traitor with heinous crimes arrested in Tianjin? The result was that several guards and officials were respectfully dispatched to escort him by motorcycle to the Japanese concession. As for the youths like Liu Chongwu, they refused to stay put and insisted on stirring up trouble in the name of patriotism, so it serves them right to taste the taste of iron bars for a few years. Even if we want to cry injustice, we have no way to start!</p>
<h3>Rain</h3>
<p>A pleasant evening, a strong wind and rain brought together a group of young people, not in a brightly lit restaurant, nor in a hotel with laughing women, but in a small attic filled with garbage.</p>
<p>Clothes racks, behind the door, several wet long gowns dragging their shadows, the sound of rain hitting the glass window, a musical rhythm, the standard artistic family of artists, five young men silently appreciating this artistic rainy night, like five plaster statues with only breath; isolated at the edge of the big city. The last cigarette in the cigarette tin, two hands simultaneously reaching in, simultaneously coming out, lit by a third party with a match, exhaling thick white smoke.</p>
<p>Laughter, the laughter of artists, disheveled hair dancing on top of their heads, a huge bow tie like the elastic breasts of a woman, lying on the bed, under the dim light, raising a pair of Russian leather shoes, soaking wet.</p>
<p>A young man with a dark face, bending over, takes out a can of Bai Jinlong from a leather bag soaked in rain, skillfully twisting off the lid, throwing it like a basketball into the artist's elastic tie. Laughter, the laughter of artists. Bai Jinlong, Golden Axe brand, twice the value.</p>
<p>(The last can). The young man with the dark face said: (Two days' journey, losing two and a half dollars on cigarettes.)</p>
<p>(de art) The Russian leather shoes beat the floor, like a fat manager in a dance hall.</p>
<p>Laughter, the laughter of artists. Laughter sent in a girl with elastic breasts.</p>
<p>Clothes rack, behind the door, adding the shadow of a wet long gown.</p>
<p>A paper bag held high in mid-air. (Bananas) she said. Several hands raised at the same time, she hid it behind her back, a charming virgin's smile, elastic breasts trembling, like the artist's tie.</p>
<p>(Who was on the phone?) The sound of rain like music hitting the glass window.</p>
<p>(Me) 丨The heels of the Russian leather shoes touched the floor.</p>
<p>(You? Didn't eat bananas) 丨Two in each, divided, peeled, white flesh, pushed into five non-artistic mouths. Laughter, the laughter of artists.</p>
<p>Pull up the second Bai Jinlong, strike a fire, exhale a thick white coat, lie down on the bed, under the dim light, raise the Russian leather shoes, soaking wet (slap) a banana peel hitting the elastic tie. With artistic eyes, an unexpected harvest of a pack of Chesfield</p>
<p>Laughter, the laughter of artists.</p>
<p>(Yulong, really a dragon in the rain). The elastic virgin's smile.</p>
<p>The young man with the dark face who was called Yulong smiled.</p>

<p>Laughter.</p>
<p>Holding the girl. The girl closes her eyes. The sound of rain hitting the glass window, like music, rising and falling.</p>
<p>The artist took away the cigarette butt, and the maid jumped up from his arms. Pouting her blood-red lips, a long whistle, the artist's portrait imprinted with lipstick on the edge of his lips. (Artist 丨I love you 丨)</p>
<p>Like slanted eyes. Laughter, the laughter of the artist, the girl deliberately showing affection to the young man with the dark face, Yuting sitting on the writing desk, the girl looking up) Yuting, why don't you speak? )</p>
<p>Yuting picked up the girl's small body (Where do you live? Tell me.)</p>

<p>(Yesterday) The girl looked at her watch and said (My Lips Betray, the artist has no share, tomorrow will.) Wiggling elastic breasts, sliding off the writing desk.</p>
<p>(Kiss me again) Like a ghost, she slipped away.</p>
<p>A pleasant evening, a strong wind and rain brought together a group of young people. Not in a brightly lit restaurant, nor in a hotel with lewd women, but in a small attic filled with garbage.</p>
<h3>A Mud Figure Bin Fu</h3>
<p>The sun was scorching, and Old Xi was running with sweat all over his face. Seeing that the lush green (Precious Bubble Cottage) was in sight, he didn't know why, but a burst of uncontrollable excitement suddenly arose in his heart, and at the same time, his face covered with sweat felt a special kind of burning heat, not caused by the weather. He slowed down his pace, trying to control that complex emotion, but obviously, the power of control could not match the surge of emotion. This was especially true the closer he got to (Precious Bubble Cottage), the more uneasy he felt, although he was now pacing like (half a step), he was finally getting closer and closer to (Precious Bubble Cottage).</p>
<p>(Sanitary Ice Cream 丨 Ice Cream 丨) Under a large poplar tree dozens of steps away from (Precious Bubble Cottage), a group of bare-chested people gathered, some laughing, some talking, some snoring and searching for good dreams on the grass, a fat one was working hard to shake the ice cream, and a young one was loudly calling out for buyers. At this time, Old Xi's desire for the (cold) ice cream was just like the ice cream seller's desire for (long-shirted) buyers like Old Xi. Old Xi put down the square box that he had been holding under his left arm for a long time, took off his sweat-soaked summer cloth gown, hung it on the white poplar branch, and sat down on a bench in the welcoming voice of the ice cream seller. Only then did he take a breath. The three copper coins of ice cream and the ice cream seller's welcoming enthusiasm made him forget everything. He felt refreshed and forgot everything.</p>
<p>He felt that everyone in the world was lovely, wasn't he? The sympathy and welcome of these bare-chested people for the unfamiliar me who had been running and getting hot was so sincere and genuine! To say that they were only for the sake of ten copper coins of business, that would be too insulting to them. He thought and thought, but when he thought about the dogs, children, nanny, and hostess inside the (Precious Bubble Cottage) opposite, this easy affirmation seemed to be negated by him again.</p>
<p>Thinking of this, he couldn't help but pick up the square box placed on the ground. When he opened it, a mud figure of (handsome appearance) and (smiling face) of (Wuxi Big A-Fu) appeared. This attracted the curious eyes of the bare-chested people, and many children even ran over to admire it with drooling mouths. But he was stingy and immediately put it away, sighing heavily.</p>
<p>乂乂乂乂乂</p>
<p>Although it is said that Old Xi was only thirty years old, the wrinkles of worldly affairs and wind and frost, resided on his cheeks and hid the youthful vigor. Anyone would believe that he must have spent forty years of cold and heat. Although it is said that he had left university life for a full seven years, during those seven years, his time with a job was less than a short seven months. Although it is said that he also had the perfect happiness of a wife and loving daughter, the long-term unemployment made him unable to support them, and the heavy burden of his wife and children, on the contrary, only became his pain and sorrow.</p>
<p>He had profound knowledge, and he also had lofty ambitions. In a certain sense, Old Xi should be called a (promising) young man, but the seeds of his bumpy fate were rooted in the so-called (knowledge) and (ambition).</p>
<p>When his life became more and more difficult with the passage of time, he had to torment all his sharp edges and (condescend) to (entreat) friends. Gu Chong, the owner of (Precious Bubble Cottage), a classmate of his during middle school and now serving as a section chief in a certain bureau, was the only person on whom Old Xi pinned his hopes.</p>
<p>Section Chief Gu cherished old friendships and agreed to find him a (suitable) position at a (suitable) time in only one meeting after Old Xi's five or six visits. This (promise) comforted Old Xi greatly. He happily went back to tell his wife, which also aroused his wife's (enthusiasm). Therefore, his wife more urgently encouraged Old Xi to visit (Precious Bubble Cottage) often, so as not to let his footsteps become estranged. His wife often tirelessly persuaded Old Xi to greet Mrs. Gu more often, and his wife often stayed up all night to mend Old Xi's long gowns or repair his suits, wanting to dress Old Xi neatly, so that he would not lose face when going to (Precious Bubble Cottage). Old Xi knew his wife's painstaking efforts, but (Precious Bubble Cottage) was still a daunting path for Old Xi after all.</p>
<p>The hostess, maid, child, and dog inside (Precious Bubble Cottage) were the most frightening to Old Xi. When Old Xi stepped into the door, that animal, that black-haired dog with drooping ears, would bark wildly with the sound of the doorbell, running to his side and scurrying around. The guest must be embarrassed for a long time before Mrs. Gu, who was sitting at a small table in front of the middle hall making needlework, would utter a cold shout: (It's an acquaintance, what are you barking for?)</p>
<p>So Old Xi was relieved and was about to offer his smile to greet and thank the hostess, but the hostess had already lowered her head and buried her face in her work, so deeply.</p>
<p>The five-year-old child had initially shown quite a bit of goodwill towards Old Xi. However, later he must have been instigated by that fat, pockmarked nanny, because as soon as he saw Old Xi, he would cry and shout (scared), or curse (Silly Xi). Old Xi would not be angry with the child, and would always say with a smile:</p>
<p>(Good boy, don't cry 丨 I'll give you something fun to play with next time!)</p>
<p>The child's memory was the best, especially with the (provocative) reminders of that pockmarked nanny. When Old Xi went again next time and did not bring (something fun), the child would cry (to the death), so the thrifty hostess would put down her work and pull the child over, (coldly mocking as she pointed at the mulberry and cursed the locust.)</p>
<h3>Fundraising (Short Play) Fire</h3>
<p>Time: Early September 1933 (Lunar July) Location: Mrs. Li's Residence</p>
<p>Characters: Mrs. Li, Wang Mazi (Public Ritual Fundraising Member), Amao (Maid), Hu Zhi (Disaster Relief Fundraiser)</p>
<p>Wang Mazi: Dong dong dong (Knocking sound)</p>
<p>Amao: Is that Ah Feng from next door? Wait a moment, the madam hasn't given me the money yet 丨 (Amao, who was cleaning the living room, found the knock familiar. Every day at this time, Ah Feng would come to invite her to buy groceries.)</p>
<p>Wang Mazi: Hey, please open the door 丨</p>
<p>Amao: (Putting down the broom, not Ah Feng?) Who is it?</p>
<p>Wang Mazi: Me, me 丨 (Followed by another burst of dong dong dong knocking sound)</p>
<p>Amao: (Me, me, who is it? Peeking through the crack in the door</p>
