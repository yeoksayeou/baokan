<p>（俟羅斯福登台將作有力表示）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）今日美政府已接到十九國委員會滿案報吿書及建議全文、國務院刻正加以考慮、默無表示、聞報吿書内容與胡佛總統向來秉循之政策、在實際上各方面無不脗合、而承認中國在滿基本主權之建議、與關於維持條約一節、尤與美國態度相同、惟因美政府更迭在即、而美官吏亦欲使世界輿論完全受該報吿書之影響、而再以他種意見夾雜其間、使世人分心而益增其複雜、故暫時不欲作任何評論至非正式評論則多稱該報吿書是以代表世界意見實一有希望之徵象、可望最後獲得滿案之圓滿解决、現此報吿書將鈔送當選總統羅斯福審閱、縱其在大體上與維氏所表示之意旨相脗合、逆料美政府將待羅氏表示意見後、始發表正式評論、且唯有在羅斯福與史汀生商榷之後、始有發表正式聲明之可能、至羅氏對於滿案向未加以直接評論、僅謂條約之神聖、必須加以維持而已、目下一般人正紛紛揣測羅氏在三月四日之就職演說中、將否述及此事、參議院外交委員會主席波拉聲稱、此報吿書之内容、乃全世界有權所期望者、但渠信日本將不願國聯取任何行動、仍貫澈其業已發表之計劃、目下美國朝野正鵠候國聯對於此報吿書之最後行動、（十七日國民電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）國務部今日表示、美國參加國聯中日爭議調解委員會與否、將聽羅斯福就總統職後决之、又參議員克勞德有任參院外交委員會新主任之說、今日據稱、國聯報吿書過縝密、未能遽加批評且不待新總統之决議、亦未便宣布對滿政策云、（十八日路透電）</p>
<p>世界社譯密勒評論報云、行將登台之羅斯福政府對於遠東危局、將如何處置、自非俟新總統實行登台並選任一新國務卿後、不能預知、直至現在新政府諸領袖僅宣稱其政策將無根本的變更、將持續胡佛史汀生不承認日本依於破壞條約而取得土地之政策、有一熟知華府政情之某君近致函本報、茲錄其言如下、「美國之對華政策、非共和黨或民主黨之政策之問題、乃是一種傳統的政策、每一政府皆承襲之、而無任何實質的變更者、但有須知者、目下胡佛與羅斯福對於各問題、意見不一、新政府登台後、或將摘前政府之規、自在意中、兩黨於選舉運動中、對於凱洛格非戰公約之態度、是多少相同者、羅斯福對於日本問題、迄今尙未表示意見、此間人頗憾日人利用羅氏於一九二二年華會之後所寫之一文、以作宣傳、須知自寫此文後十年以來、時勢已大大變遷矣、在大體上、民主黨對國聯較爲友睦、但依此點而作任何預言、則爲早計、就民主黨之爲一黨而論、較少採用可以引起戰爭之任何政策之勇氣、有人預料羅斯福對中國或將此胡佛較爲友善、蓋胡佛因拳亂時適在天津、故不免有偏見也、目下有一國之民主黨要人於羅斯福指導之下、正在從事遠東時局之嚴重而非正式的研究、以備新總統上台後之運用、内政及經濟問題戰債與國際經濟會議、勢將佔在滿洲問題之先、民主黨間與共和黨間相同、現有一種時常表示之希望、即日本最後於經濟上崩潰、如是免列强取任何强厲的行動、而致引起危險的事態也」云、</p>
<p>（華盛頓）美國法律專家研究十九國委員會建議後、今日聲稱、國聯大會關於滿案　將採取之行動、美國參加與否、大半將視能否設置美滿機關、保護中國主權及日本合法利益以爲斷、此輩專家對於報吿書内所稱日本利益、皆屬事實不能漠視一節、似欲加以同意、但一方面旣須保護此種利益、而同時又須堅持完全遵守有關此項爭執之各條約、乃一最糾結之問題、國務院必須先行解决而後能聲明美國之立塲、現美政府在國聯對於報吿書有最後行動以前、固未必有正式表示、但參議員業已紛紛討論報吿書、顯似有一大部份將反對美國參加向日本施以壓力之運動、並有多數參議員言日本將自行充分讓步、俾談判有開始之可能、頃間又聞當選總統羅斯福因與紐約民主黨領袖有宿約在先、將俟數日後始能有研究十九國委員會建議之機會、（十七日國民社電）</p>

<h3 id="c9">開戰一年半方見所謂「最後通牒」 <a href="#c9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>— 晦</p>
<p>㈠十九國委員會建議以後</p>
<p>日本自國聯盟十九國委員會提出建議而後。日政府顯示驚惶。軍部則肆其咆哮。以爲當立即退出國聯。實行其所夢想之亞細亞門羅主義遂行「大陸政策」達其兼併東北三省侵略華北之目的。此次十九國委員提議旣不承認日軍前年九一八在瀋陽暴行爲自衛。又復建議聯盟會員國不承認「和製傀儡」丨「滿洲國」。其主張「公道」之誠意。殊値得吾人稱許。而對於日軍之撤退未有時間及程序之明確規定。東三省領土主權。尤應先行恢復否則終屬「鏡裏曇華」。實行無力。矧國聯僅爲一道義制裁機關。又安能使日本軍閥之必然就範。則是最低限度。亦須使用盟約第十六條爲經濟的封鎖。使日本軍國主義者尙知世界之有「公道正義。」列國究可不欺。中國亦未可侮。</p>
<p>然而日閥强橫成性。對内對外均恃武力。匪特欲兼併「滿洲」且又强佔楡關屯兵遼熱邊境。而尤厚顏自頌謂爲維持遠東和平。其實破壞遠東和平者。日本之鐵手也。撕毁國際一切公約者。亦日本之軍閥也舉世界各國有識者莫不認識日本帝國主義之强暴。而爲我國代抱不平也。雖然事變迄今。所以因循至此。由遼吉北滿以至錦義。今且禍被楡關飛炸熱境者。一面固由於國際政局之動搖不定。另一面則我國無實力足爲「公道正義」之後盾。是以任日閣之縱橫而無可裁制。</p>
<p>尤有甚者。日軍得寸進尺。楡關挑衅。熱邊示威。乃竟公言將於本月二十七日開始進攻熱河。三月一日將展開大規模戰鬥。蓋三月一日爲日軍製造「」、</p>
<p>滿洲傀儡國」之週年也。於是豫備所謂之「最後通牒。」第一通由所謂「滿洲」政府送致熱河省主席湯玉麟。第二通由關東軍司令官武藤信義送致北平東三省長官張學良。第三通由日本政府送致國民政府。其措詞爲（日本）强求中國軍隊退出熱河。蓋彼以爲熱河乃「滿洲」土地。是誠何言哉。日本軍國主義的侵略於是暴露無遺矣</p>
<p>㈡日本之怪聲明</p>
<p>日本對外之有二重外交。國内之有二重政府。由來已久。惟九一八事變以還。尤爲顯著所謂外務部所謂内閣。不過爲軍部之應聲虫。亦猶傀儡已耳。是故凡有事變發生。（尤以中日有關事件與夫東北問題。涉及國際關係者。）日本軍部必發一次奇異聲明以表示日閥之侵略意識及其對外强橫能度。此次國聯十九委員會宣明責任。認爲滿洲傀儡。實爲日閥軍隊所鑄成。與東北三千萬人民絲毫無關。於是日本陸軍當局又發聲明。以爲「日本之承認「滿洲」爲其國策。攻擊熱河亦不容國聯過問。現在國聯旣拒絕日本之提案。而反質問日本。使日本難堪。故日本無回答必要。勿寗即行退出國聯之爲提當。」</p>
<p>更可怪者。武藤關東司令亦發聲明。「第一謳歌其所製造之（傀儡）「滿洲。」第二稱述列國漸次諒解所謂王道建國之眞義。第三又謂國聯泥於李頓報吿無視「滿洲國」之「現狀。」又謂『日本義難坐視。并固執東洋和平···』</p>
<p>此種聲明。除日本部自讚之外。其他回聲。恐皆爲極端之反調也。蓋蹂躪東北疆土。破壞東洋和平撕毁國際一切公約。殺戮我國人民等等殘暴行爲。皆爲日本軍隊之實際表現。事實昭然。絕無可飾。今後其野性大發。苟不得鐵與血之制。止恐彼終無自行悔悟之日。而侵略行爲。亦將愈演愈烈也。</p>
<p>㈢調解失敗比武開場</p>
<p>日本旣不承認國聯之調解。且又堅持其侵略主張「承認傀儡。」誠如英外相所云。「國聯非太上國家。并無强制會員國遵行之力。」則國聯於日本之暴行。實無法可加裁制。日本不接受國聯勸吿。則調解僅有宣吿失敗而已。况日本審知美國目前須培養國力。决不敢侈言戰爭。英國内雖未平。有時或亦須借助於日本。蘇聯精力。悉集於國内建設。豈肯輕於挑衅。於是日本帝國主義。乃得而恃其武力。繼續蠶食政策。由遼寗而吉黑而楡關。今則自誓必取熱河。然而我則何如調解已宣吿失敗。日軍羣集邊境。「最後通牒」到手勢即開塲比武矣。今後戰爭已無可避免。解决東北問題。護守熱河。惟視我國如何運用自已之鐵拳。始何湧出自已之熱血。以奪回换地。以洗滌奇恥。</p>

<p>（紐約）美海軍航空局長莫斐德今夜在美海軍大學畢業同學會演說、謂弱小之海軍、足以招致戰爭、今後日本旣造成一「滿洲國」該國不受海軍條約限制、日本可假託其名義儘量造艦、因此日本造艦、實際將不受任何限制、美國則所有軍艦老朽、不能編入艦隊者甚衆、亟應急起直追、添造新艦、不當再聽令其實力之日就衰弱云（十七日國民電）</p>

<p>（倫敦）英保守派國會議員吉邱爾今夜在此間反社會主義與反共產主義聯盟年會演說、表示美國關於滿案將　英國對日本取一更堅决態度、但邱氏竟率直聲稱、美國不應勸英國與日本相爭、因美國旣以不合理條約束縛英國之海軍、不應再勸英人與日本相爭、並信國聯亦不宜與日本相爭、因歐洲方有大工作、待國聯做去、至若遠東距其勢力範圍太遠云云、按邱氏此語雖有袒日色彩、但亦可以表示英人一部份意見云、（十七日國民電）</p>

<p>（倫敦）泰晤士報今日社論、指十九特委會之報吿書爲溫和·公允·且熟經考慮者、謂如任何一方面以强暴行爲造成新局勢、則國聯行政院日後或須重行考慮全部地位、報吿書建議一種廣大的自治權、此舉明明欲爲日本保留更大權利、甚於其前在原有狀况下所享受者、此報吿書當然可爲國聯大會所通過、國聯會員國在此案通過後、當不致作何行動、致妨礙或延緩其建議案之實施、並將繼續不在法律上或事實上承認滿洲之現狀、雖自關係各國不必始終爲任何特别政策所拘束、但各國必須以國聯報吿書爲起點、而進行同樣政策、苟稍有變更、亦必出以一致同意而後可云（十八日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）著名週刋旁觀人今日社論、謂國聯决議案必可爲美國所贊同、而蘇俄亦或可贊助之、果爾、則其影響將爲世界無一國政府可承認「滿洲國」、亦無一國金融市塲可承借「滿洲國」債欵、同時日本朝野財力所可借與「滿洲國」者、其可２</p>
<p>能性殊爲微細、於此亦可見國聯尙未討論積極制裁、而僅採此工具之價値矣、同時國聯顯然不能以投票通過十九特委會决議案爲已盡其責任、而遂洗手不問也、今後尙有兩大目的須達到者、㈠根據中日與國聯間之協定而不借日本兵力之援助、在滿洲設立一種行政機關、㈡恢復日本與國聯間尋常友好之關係、該報又謂暫時日本或退出國聯、而兵力或遍及於滿洲與熱河、但事有不能倖免者、日本終不能如願以償、目前尙望各國一致禁止對日輸出軍火云、（十七日路透電）</p>

<h3 id="c76">意國大批軍火由奧運匈法國對奧提出嚴厲牒文 <a href="#c76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>路透十七日羅馬電　近有軍械一批、由意運奧修理、法國因以疑爲秘密供結奧國法西斯黨之用、即向奧政府提出嚴厲牒文、而英國亦加入、茲據意大利日報巴黎訪員稱、法國之牒文中要求奧政府將此項軍械運回意國、或加以銷毁、並向英法代表作關於此事之誓言云、意人聞之、甚爲憤懣、現恐法意兩國將因此發生衝突、</p>
<p>哈瓦斯十八日巴黎電　據意大利日報載一消息、謂法國因中歐私運軍火案、似曾通牒奧國、牒文内容、與眞正哀的美敦書無異云云、巴黎晨報載稱、外交部之意、意報所載消息、當指法國會同英國送致奧國牒文而言、其中并無哀的美敦書之性質云云、</p>
<p>路透十八日倫敦電　據確實消息、法國致奧之牒文、並非哀的美敦書、但呈完全友好性質、英法兩政府近曾向奧國作友誼的建議、以解决此事、如談判不成、則此事將交國聯行政院辦理、</p>
<p>國民十七日巴黎電　法國因恐巴爾幹半島之風雲、再引起歐洲第二次之戰爭、故今日特向奧國送達哀的美敦式之牒文、要求奧國於兩星期之内、將由意大利途經奧國運往匈牙利之大批軍火、退還意大利、據云、該項軍火之數目、實足以供一大軍團之用、據牒文要求、該項軍火應回原發貨人、否則應立時加以銷燬、其餘各項要求甚多、如㈠奧政府應給與法國保障、證明該項軍火已經銷燬或退回、㈡奧政府應澈查前此有無軍火由奧境漏入匈牙利、㈢奧國應於二星期内完成澈查工作、而給法國以保障、自法國此種牒文提出後、歐洲各國政府、均覺事態頗爲嚴重、以此事實與近日發生之小協約有關、匈加利因恐受羅馬尼亞·捷克及南斯拉夫三國聯盟之壓迫、故不得不預事防止鄰國之軍事侵犯、此或爲匈牙利購置軍備之動因、故法國此次之提出牒文、羅馬尼亞等三小協約極爲贊成、按法國此舉、乃一月來詳細調查與維也納先後發出矛盾聲明之結果、果近奧政府致法復文、承認此項軍火運往希爾登培廠、但謂本係奧國後爲竟有、今乃運往修理、奧政府因其可以給奧工人以工作、故允予運輪入、奧政府前此一復文、則承認此項軍火運往希爾登培、但謂係屬過境、完且合法、法國則因其數目過鉅、不肯含糊了結、據法外部　知、希爾登培地方官曾宣稱、共有來福槍五萬枝、機關槍二百架、此外大約尙有飛機若干、因曾見飛機飛過奧國入匈境後、迄未飛回、嗣法政府因奧國之聲明、前後矛盾、加以社會黨報紙之危言、愈欲根究其事、蓋社會黨人以爲寗甘此項軍火落入匈牙利人之手、不願其爲巴爾幹他國所得、因若意國一旦與南斯拉夫失和時、則匈牙利將爲南斯拉夫　隣邦中最强之敵人云、</p>
<p>國民十七日羅馬電　法意兩國間之交誼惡化之際、今日复有法國對於意國軍械由奧運匈牙利一事之抗議、於是國際間形態遂益呈嚴重之勢、法國此項抗議已由法使向維也納政府提出、據意大利普波羅報所稱、該項文件、係「國際間從來少見之惡劣文章」、普波羅復略叙此軍械運輸案之經過、謂此不過私人間之一種交易、所謂軍火者亦不過數舊式來福槍、係由意國歐戰事自奧國奪來者、今因用舊、特送回喜登堡原製造廠家修理改造、以便轉售者、普波羅報復稱、法國之抗議書、採取哀的美敦之形式、實予奧大利獨立國一重大侮辱、蓋以其完全不顧國際間儀式、故可預料其必致引起他國對法國之憤懣、而斥爲擾亂和平者云、</p>

<p>路透十七日日内瓦電　今日軍縮會議討論法國提出之規定歐洲及其他大陸國家之陸軍標準、及縮短軍役期限、减少常備軍額之提案時、德法兩國代表在會議席上大肆舌戰、法代表畢愛爾宣稱、有若干國家之軍事設備性質、雖屬合法、但頗能引起軍國之思想、德代表那杜爾尼則謂、規定陸軍標準、實非减縮軍備必要之條件、並稱、現各方要求德　改組軍隊、此事必須加以愼重之考慮、那氏又拒絕接受各方對於德國任何之責言云、</p>
<p>塔斯十七日日内瓦電　今日軍縮會議政治委員會開會時、蘇聯首席代表李維諾夫發表對於日前英國所作軍縮提案之二點修正、按英國原來之提案、主張由歐洲國家單獨發一宣言、正式宣布廢止以任何武力解决國際爭端、同時、再由所有國家發表一軍縮協定之總宣言、當時李氏即已指出英國所提議宣言之性質、將使非歐洲國家僅受凱洛非戰公約之束縛、而歐洲國家則被限制、在任何狀况下均不能引用武力、今日李氏又提議加以修正、即將宣言中限於歐洲國家之字樣取去、使成爲普遍性、惟聲明雖同時有軍縮協定之總宣言、該宣言亦非僅限於臨時應用者、李氏解釋其提議云、國際間宣布廢止應用一切武力及强制行爲、應述於文字、由所有加入凱洛公約之國家共同署名、使成一正式之國際約法、惟蘇聯代表國不能同意使侵略事在歐洲國家與非歐洲國家間有相異之解釋、蓋如歐洲國家同此宣言而得例外之保障、則非歐洲國家必受損失、且歐洲國家除被同洲國家攻擊之危險外、亦有被他洲國家攻擊之可能也、最後李氏表示、英國所提議廢止應用一切武力之宣言、應在軍縮協定成立之前、即行簽字、蓋如以爲此宣言應與軍縮協定同時發表、則不知將在將來何時、或此時期亦不來臨也、况目前多數國家之政府、均極短壽、當時機來臨、各國已準備簽字、而其中一國家之新政府出現、拒絕簽字於宣言、即可將已成之局推翻云、</p>

<p>中國代表對日又一聲明（二）</p>
<h3 id="c81">樸資茅條約之精神 <a href="#c81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>關於對日經濟絕交事件、中國政府之意見、已於行政院中國代表之演辭中及中國代表對國聯提出之說帖中、詳細解釋、茲可無庸再贅、惟經濟絕交事件、若果如日本代表所稱、爲變相之戰爭者、則試問日軍之對滿侵略、佐以大砲飛機機關槍隊及其他一切武器、以殺戮中國人民損害中國財產者、又將何辭以形容之乎、簡言之、現在中國之對日經濟絕交、其最初原因、乃爲一九三一年七月間在日本警務當局默許下之朝鮮地方之華人大屠殺、結果、華人死一百四十二人、傷五百四十六人、失踪九十一人、財產損失逾日金匹百萬元、九一八事件發生、日軍侵入滿洲、而此項經濟絕交運動、亦更見活躍、過去每一對日經濟絕交運動、均爲一種對日本軍事侵略或挑釁之對抗手腕、出</p>
<p>諸萬分無奈、此乃極明顯之事實、三十年來、對日經濟絕交、計有九次、然日本代表則僅指出四次、認爲不能作爲對日本軍事行爲之抵抗行動、是不啻默認其他五次、確可視爲對抗日軍侵略之行爲矣吾人再就日方所指出之四次一一詳察之、則一九○八年之經濟絕交爲二辰丸事件發生後、日方提出最後通牒以冀滿足其任意要求之結果、一九○九年之經濟絕交、則爲中日談判關於重建安東潘陽鐵路時、日本方面提出同樣挑釁要求之結果、一九一九年之經濟絕交、則爲日本藉口消滅德人勢力、不肯將日軍撤退出東之引起華人自然反抗之結果、而一九二三年之經濟絕交、則爲中國國民反抗日本政府堅持履行以所謂二十一條爲根據之一九一五年協定之表現也、</p>
<p>日本代表對關於所謂齊納繼夫事件、英國政府對蘇維埃代表之牒文、引證甚多、然實則對於經濟絕交問題、毫無關係、無論中國國民政府及莫斯科蘇維埃政府之組織、全不相似、且觀於日軍在滿洲乃至上海平津各處侵略行爲之性質及程度、中國人民或集團之採取並維持經濟絕交運動、以爲合法之自衛行爲、實具有充分理由者也、</p>
<p>日本代表聲明書中、曾提及一九三二年一月至三月間之上海事件、關於此事、中國代表已對李頓調查團提出文件數項、足資參考、該文件中已明白聲明、一月二十八日晚、日本武裝軍隊以機關槍爲助、先攻擊中國警察、復攻擊中國軍隊、然中國軍警則嚴取防守態度、故日方所稱日軍被開火者、實與事實不符也、</p>
<p>復次、當時各國陸海軍當局共同商定分防上海公共租界之辦法、中國當局旣未參加、亦並未受通知、更無約束中國方面之理由、而所謂日軍之防區、其中有一部分乃爲應受中國管理者、且各國陸海軍司令即擬定辦法、亦未許日軍即可侵入公共租界以外之中國區域、或進攻駐在該處附近之中國軍隊也、</p>
<p>據中立方面如國聯所委派之領事委員會等之有威權的報吿、上海事件之發生、完全由於日本方面之預定計畫、其目的乃在恐嚇華人而减低其對滿洲狀况之抵抗精神、而上海事件之結果、則爲死華人二萬四千餘人、損害財產十五萬萬元、而上海居民所受之痛苦、更屬不可算計、</p>
<p>尤可怪者、日本代表對日軍進攻上海而致之華人生命損失一點、竟請行政院注意中國軍隊致中國人民之更大之生命損失、日本政府心理之奇特、此乃一最顯著之例、夫此二者、乃絕無連帶關係者、日本代表將此二事混爲一談、理由何在、殊不可解、意者日本之意、中國大政治過度時期所不可避免之内亂、其中頗有爲日本所挑動者、乃可爲日本軍人用武力侵略中國國土、而致中國人民以更多量之苦痛之理由乎、此種態度、其爲違反全人類之　義及良知、固不辯自明也、</p>

<p>（一）事端發展之簡述　自此案提交國聯後、行政院及大會屢次之决議、均視本案在遠東情勢之變遷而定、發中日爭端發生之初、中國政府根據盟約第十一條、將本案提請國聯處理時、事變之範圍、不過僅及於瀋陽及東三省若干之其他地點而已、行政院時並屢獲日本保證、謂日本在滿洲并無領土野心、只須日僑生命財產得有安全之保證、則日本即可將軍隊撤退至南滿區城以内、此即係一九三二年九月三十日决議及十月廿四日决議草案之旨趣後者、除日本外爲行政院全體所同意、故能使行政院向日本代表團、再行求取承諾、在日本代表佢絕上項草案後、因日本復堅持、須解决中日各根本問題遂使行政院方面、於無碍九月三十日决議案如承諾之實施的範圍内、更行提出辦法、以期使兩國之各問題、得有最後之根本解决、一九三二年十二月十日、行政院接受日本之提議、决議組織一「調查團」赴當地調查、並將「任何情形影響國際關係、而有擾亂中日兩國和平或和平所維繫之諒解之虞者、」具報於行政院、在十二月與三月之間、遠東情勢、甚形惡化、日本軍隊、完全佔入南滿、並開始侵佔北滿、在滿洲以外、中日正式軍隊劇烈之衝突、已在上海開始、且進行未已、同時在被日本軍隊佔據之區域内、爲行政機關改組、形成獨立國之建設、名「滿洲國」否認中國之統治權、嗣後中國申請行政院、除按照盟約第十一條外、並依據第十條及第十五條處理此項爭執、一九三二年二月十九日、因中國依照第十五條第九節規定請求之結果、行政院將爭執事件、提交大會、調查團報吿書、爲詳細審查爭執之實質所必要、故從一月起、在未接到調查團報吿書以前、行政院及以後大會之主要任務、在盡其力之所及、以停止敵對行爲、並制止情勢之更形擴大、同時保恃當事國之權利及盟約之原則、俾不受任何「旣成事實」之不良影響、並與三月十一日之議决案、明白表示聯合會對於爭執事件之態度、聲言在未遵照盟約解决以前、聯合會會員國、應不予承認任何情勢、任何條約或協定、其造成之方法、違反盟約或巴黎公約者、上海敵對行爲吿終、但在東三省日本軍隊或「滿洲國」政府軍隊、繼續與中國非正式軍隊作戰、一九三二年九月、於調查團報吿書在北平簽字後之數日、日本政府態度、又有根本之改變、即日本政府承認「滿洲國」政府是也、調查團報吿書之　達日内瓦、不能在九月底以前、即六個月期限屆滿之前、此項期限、係盟約内規定依照第十五條致送報吿書於大會者、故大會經當事國之同意、於七月一日决定展緩必須之期限、但了解此種展期、不得視爲先例、調查團因此遂能當地完成報吿書、當事國遂能致送報吿書之意見、而行政院與大會、亦能審查所以如此獲得之材料、此種材料之審查、及與當事國意見之交換、自一九三二年十一月起、直至一九三三年二月初、繼續不斷、經行政院討論以後、大會根據調查團報吿書所載之材料及結論、依照第十五條第三節、以當事國談判之方法、設法解决爭端、但無效果、以致大會依照該條第四節通過此次之報吿書、</p>
<p>（二）爭執提出國聯之起因　一九三一年九月十八至十九日、在南滿發生之事件、行政院最初之討論中國之請求、行政院由於日本軍隊於一九三一年九月十八夜、在滿洲所取之舉動、因一事件發生於附近瀋陽、爲日軍所護之南滿鐵路地帶、日本軍事長官、遂以軍事上之防範必要爲詞、派兵至地帶外、特别至地帶相毘連之中國城市、及在瀋陽終止之鐵路線、中國城市、如瀋陽長春安東營口及他處、遂被佔入、中國軍隊被驅散或繳械、九月二十一日、中國依照盟約第十一條申請行政院、立即採取步驟、制止情勢之再有變化、以致危害國際之和平、並回復事變以前之狀態、及確定中華民國應得賠償之情質與數目、九月二十二日行政院授權行政院主席、（即西班牙代表勒樂）致緊急申請書於兩國政府、制止任何行動足以使形勢擴大或有碍和平解决此項問題者、並勸兩國政府可立即進行撤退其軍隊、而不危及其人民之生命與財產、九月二十八日行政院主席、根據自兩當事國所得之報吿、向當時大例會解釋情形聲言「日本軍隊撤退至南滿鐵路地帶以内一節、正在進行之中、並謂九月二十八日日本代表已在行政院宣稱進行撤兵除瀋陽及吉林二處在鐵路地帶以外、駐在日本少數隊伍者、僅新民鄭家屯、爲保護日本僑民免受中國兵士及土匪之侵擊、因此種士兵及土匪正在擾亂上述之地方、」當九月三十日行政院通過下列議决案時、（參觀一九三一年十二月國聯公報第二三零七頁）其情形如此、决議案如下、㈠行政院知悉中日政府對於行政院主席所爲緊急聲請之答覆、及爲應付此種聲請所取之步驟、㈡行政院對於日本政府之聲明、謂對於東省並無圖謀領土之意、認爲重要、㈢行政院知悉日代表之聲明、謂日本軍隊業經開始撤退、日本政府當以日本人民生命財產之安全得有切實之保證爲比例、仍繼續將其軍隊從速撤退至鐵路區域以内、並希望從速完全實行此項意願、㈣行政院知悉中國代表之聲明、謂中國政府對於該區域以外日僑生命財產之安全、在日軍繼續撤退、中國地方官吏及警察再行恢復時、當負責任、㈤行政院深信雙方政府、均極欲避免採取任何行動、足以擾亂兩國間之和平及諒解者、普知悉中日代表、已保證各該國政府採取一切必要步驟、以防止事變範圍之擴大、或情勢之愈加嚴重、㈥行政院請求當事兩方、盡力所能速行恢復兩國間通常之關係、並爲求達到此項目的繼續並從速完成上述保證之實行、㈦行政院請求當事兩方、隨時將關於情勢發展之消息、充分供給於行政院、㈧行政院决定如無意外事件發生、有即時開會之必要者、則於十月十日在日内瓦再行開會、以考量彼時之情勢、㈨行政院授權於其主席、經向各同僚尤其兩關係國代表諮詢後、認爲根據從當事國或從其他各會員方面所得關於情勢進展之消息、無須再行開會時、得取消本院十月十四日之會議、（行政院之願望未得實現）十月十日中國代表團、爲日軍繼續積極進攻、用飛機轟炸臨時省政府所在地之錦州、要求行政院召開緊急會議、行政院在九月開會時、曾决定將該院之會議錄、及關於中日糾紛之文件、送致美國政府、同時美國政府亦表示與國聯態度十分同情、十月十六日行政院决定、繼續與美國政府合作、並邀請美國政府派遣代表列席行政院、以便商討巴黎非戰公約條文、與滿洲不幸現狀之關係及觀察、行政院關於該問題之其他一切討論、美國政府送致同樣照會於中日兩國政府、十月二十二日行政院主席、（法國代表白里安）提出一决議草案、該草案除當事國外一致同意、該决議草案於申述中日兩國政府、按照前月三十日决議案所承允之約束、及日本代表所稱日本在滿决無領土企圖之宣言後、即請日本政府立即開始將日軍撤退至鐵路區域以内、於下次開會以前、全數撤盡、並請中國政府準備接收日軍撤退區域之辦法、以保證日僑生命財產之安全、該草案爲實行起見、</p>
<p>且將詳細辦法、亦略加規定、該决議草案、復向中日兩國政府建議、日軍撤盡後、兩國應立即開始直接交涉談判、中日間一切懸案、尤其關於最近事件、及關於由東省鐵路情形所發生之糾紛、爲達上項目的行政院建議兩當事國、應組織調解委員會、或類似之永久機關、最後提議行政院、應於十一月十六日再行集會、十二月十三日中國代表接受該項决議草案、視爲最低限度、日本代表則提一對案、說明日本政府鑒於滿洲局勢之緊張及情形、不能預定日軍撤盡之確切日期、日本政府認定恢復較寗靜之心理狀態、爲絕對必要、因此决定原則數點、爲中日兩國間經常關係之基礎、但日本代表無權將此種原則、列入决議案中、亦無權在行政院會議席上詳細討論、以爲此種原則、只應爲兩當事國直接談判之基本條件、行政院認爲旣不知悉「原則」之内容、當然不能在决議草案内提及該决議草案、因日本代表之反對、十月二十四日未曾通過行政院、延會至十一月十八日、中國代表於十月二十四日會議後、曾代表中國政府向行政院主席發表下列之宣言、中國與其他國聯會員國、同樣受盟約之約束、謹愼遵守一切條約上之義務、中國政府矢志盡盟約上所規定之一切義務、爲證明此種意志、關於條約解釋方面、與日本之一切爭執、極願依照盟約第十三條之規定、用公斷或交法庭解决之、爲實行此種意志、中國政府願與日本訂立公斷條約、一如中美新近訂立之公斷條約、或近年國聯各會員國間所訂之多數公斷條約然、</p>
<p>㈢日本軍事行動在北滿之進展　行政院十月開會以後、日軍在滿洲洮昻鐵路之嫩江橋附近、復從事攻擊嫩江橋、於十月間被黑龍江省主席馬占山軍隊所燬、以阻止張海鵬軍隊之前進蓋據中國方面稱張海鵬係受日軍之主使而取攻勢者也、爲辯護干涉嫩江橋之修理爲合理、日本政府單向中國政府聲稱調洮昻路、係依據合同、由南满鐵路株式會社建築中國方面、尙未償還債務、且不願將上債改爲借欵、故此路可認爲屬於南滿鐵路株式會社、該社對於保護該路財產及維持該路交通、掁屬極爲關心云、十一月二日、日本政府聲明、因南滿及洮昻鐵路局之請求、爰於是日派遣工兵一隊、由步砲及空軍保護、前往修理鐵路橋、日軍當即與拒絕退讓之華軍衝突、而將其擊退、十一月中日本軍隊、遂開到且越過中東鐵路而取得昻昻溪、嗣并於十一月十九日、取得齊齊哈爾、</p>
<p>（四）改組滿洲民政機關之辦法　當軍事上行動如此向滿進展時、民政機關之改組、亦復同時進行、就瀋陽言之、在九一八事變發生政局解組以後、當地政府、首即交由日本上校土肥原負責、嗣於十月二十日、則由在東京帝國大學畢業之法律博士華人趙欣伯充任市長時、遼寗前省政府、已遷往錦州、因又組織一遼寗省政府以資對抗、九月二十四日所組織之地方維持委員會、十月間改爲遼寗省自治公署、十一月七日自治公署、復又改爲代理遼寗省政府宣吿與從前之東北政府及南京國民政府脫離關係、同時復成立最高指導部、其職權之一部、即爲指導并監督省政府、及鼓勵地方自治、凡此種種新機關以及發行紙幣之銀行、均派有日本顧問、此項顧問、則大半爲南滿路具有勢力之職員、中國代表則堅稱瀋陽吉林及其他日軍佔據之地點、所有種種新機關之成立與維持、均應由日軍負責、以爲此種種機關、均係日軍之傀儡、日軍之產生物、日代表則答復以爲日本當局、除鼓勵華人自行組織團體維持秋序外、别無他法、此等團體、果能克盡其職責、則將使日本政府屢次所正式表示之願望、亦謂從速撤兵一節、較易實現、不第此也、一九三一年十一月間中國代表團曾將鹽務稽核會辦克利夫蘭德博士（Ｄr·ＦudrichＡ·Ｃlefuland）之迭次報吿、送交行政院、據該項報吿、則日本陸軍當局彼時正以武力奪取滿洲各地之鹽稅、而據日本公文之所述、則謂日本陸軍當局、將中國鹽稅機關之餘欵、另行移轉於他一中國機關、（當地之地方維持委員會）不能謂爲不當、</p>
<p>（五）一九三一年十一十二月間之行政院會議調查團之組織、是時行政院正於十一月十六日、在巴黎集會、十一月二十一日日本方面提議、派遣調查團、至遠東調查、并謂『日本政府依照九月三十日之决議案、從速撤兵至南滿鐵路區域之眞誠的願望、决不因此項調查團之產生與派遣而有所變更、』該項提議、經考慮後、十二月十日行政院乃通過下列之决議、</p>
<p>（一）行政院重申九月三十日一致通過之决議、該决議經中日兩方聲明、各受其莊嚴約束、故行政院要求中日政府採取必要步驟、實行該項决議、俾日軍依照該决議内所開條件、儘請撤退至鐵路區域内、（二）政府院認爲自十一月二十四日會議後、事態更爲嚴重、知悉兩方擔任採取必要辦法、防止情勢之再行擴大、并避免任何行動、致再令發生戰爭及喪失生命之事、（三）行政院請兩方繼續將情勢之發展、隨時通知行政院、（四）行政院請其他會員國、將各該國代表就地所得之消息、隨時供給行政院、（五）行政院鑒於本案之特殊情形、欲協促進兩國政府、謀兩國政府間各項問題之最後根本解决、故並不妨示上述辦法之實行决定、派遣一委員會、該委員會以五人組織之、就地研究任何情形影響國際關係、而有擾亂中日兩國和平或和平所維繫之諒解之虞者、並報吿於行政院、中日兩國政府各得派參加委員一人、襄助該委員會、兩國政府對於該委員會、應予以一切便利、俾該委員會所需之任何消息、均可得到了解如兩方開始任何商議、該項商議不在該委員會織務範圍之内、又該委員會對於任何一方之軍事辦法、無干涉之權、該委員會之委派、及其考量對於日本政府在九月三十日决議内所爲日軍撤退之鐵路區域内之保證、無任何防礙、（六）以現在及一月二十五日舉行下次常會之間、行政院仍在受理本問題中、請主席注意本問題、並於必要時、再行召集會議、（行政院主席法國代表白理安於提出是項决議案時、曾鄭重聲明、行政院對於九月三十日之决議案、及其自身之確信、以爲兩國政府將充分履行該决議之約言各節、均極端重視、並稱雙方、均避免任何足以更致戰事日或使事態擴大之行動、實爲必要、而急切上項决議案通過時、美國政府曾表示欣快、實已有確切進步、）</p>
<p>（六）日軍攻擊錦州丨南滿方面中國殘餘行政權之摧滅、當行政院從事草擬上項决議案時、中日雙方均曾請行政院對於延及滿洲西南部之軍事行動的危險、予以注意、因而有一種努力、即設法在日軍與錦州張學良之軍隊間、設立中立區域、惟是此種努力·不幸失敗、日本代表當該决議案通過時、關於該决議之第二節、曾聲明接受、惟須了解該節之用意、並非阻止日軍因直接保護日僑生命財產以免滿洲各地土匪或不法份子之蹂躪所必須採取之行動、該項行動、實係一種例外之辦法、基於東北之特殊情形、將來該地常狀、一經恢復、則此種辦法之必要性、自亦歸於消滅、十二月二十三日日軍即開始向錦州方面進攻、而於一九三二年一月三日實行佔領、日軍當更進至長城、而與駐紮長城南山海關之日軍連絡、此種軍事行動之結果、即爲南滿方面中國行政權之完全摧滅、</p>

<p>第三部　爭議之主要特性</p>
<p>由此紀述、可見行政院或大會繼續試覓中日爭議之解决方法、已逾十六月、並已根據盟約各條及其他國際公約通過中日議决案、凡事變之歷史背景、其情形之複雜、與日本在中國境内行使廣大權利之滿洲特殊情形、以及在滿洲數處、中日當局間事實上决有關係之錯誤複雜，均證明國聯之長期盡力於協商及調查，確爲必要、然行政院及大會所抱希望，以期由各方之聲明、及其叄加通過之議决案、而促現狀之進步、則已失敗、</p>
<p>而現狀反趨於日更惡劣、在滿洲或在國聯會員國之一之其他地方、其軍事行動誠爲調查團所稱、爲『變相的戰事』者也、猶日進不已、大會將爭執之特要各點、詳加考慮後、得如下之結論、并知悉下列各項事實、（一）提交國聯大會之中日爭執、發生於滿洲、中國以及列强始終皆認滿洲爲中國之一部、其主權屬於中國、日本政府於其對調查團報吿書之意見書内辯駁、在範圍極小之南滿鐵路區域内、中國前給俄國、嗣轉讓於日本之權利、與中國主權衝突之說、謂其實此項權利、係由中國主權而來、中國始給俄國、嗣給日本之權利、均起原於中國之主權、按照一九零五年之北京條約、『中國皇室政府應允俄國按樸資茅斯條約對於日本之一切讓予、』一九一五年、日本展長其在滿洲權利之要求、係向中國政府提出、其後同年五月二十五日、關於南滿及内蒙東部之條約、亦係由日本與中華民國政府所締結、華盛頓會議時、一九二二年二月二日、日本代表團聲明、日本放棄南滿及内蒙東部之某項優先特權、并云、日本之所以决定放棄者、係基於一種公平溫和之精神、始終注意中國之主權、以及機會均等之原則云云、華盛頓會議所簽結之九國公約、適用於滿洲、自與中國其他各部無之、即在此次衝突之初期、日本對於滿洲爲中國之一部之說、亦從未持異議、㈡就已經之經騐而言、從前支配滿洲之當局、對於中國其他各部之事務、至少在華北方面、均具有相當之勢力、在軍事上政治上、處於有利地位、尤無疑義、若强將該省與中國他部削開、勢將造成一嚴重之未收回領土問題、而危及和平、國聯大會提出上述事實、非不注意及滿洲過去之自治歷史、舉期極端之例、在中國中央政府權力極弱之時代、張作霖之全權代表、竟代中華民國東三省自治政府之名義、於一九二四年九月二十日、與蘇聯締結關於中東鐵路航行劃界以及其他問題之協定、惟該協定之條文、顯然表示東三省自治政府、并未自謀爲對中國獨立的國家之政府、蓋該政府僅信關於中國在東三省之權益、東三省政府、亦可自行與蘇聯談判、雖則數月前中央政府已與蘇聯締結關於上述問題之協定、東省之自治、亦可於以前之張作霖及以後之張學良爲民政及軍事領袖、與夫　其所屬之軍隊及官吏、在三省内行使權力各節窺見之、但張作霖迭次宣吿之獨立、從未表示張氏本人或東三省人民、有欲脫離中國之原望、張氏軍隊之侵入關内、僅係加入内爭、而並非視中國如外國、故在東省屢次戰爭及獨立期間、東三省仍爲中國之一部份、且自一九二八年以來、張學良已承認國民政府之權威矣、四在一九三一年九月以前之二十五年、中國與東三省之政治經濟關係、日增密切、同時日本在東三省之利益、亦繼續發展、在中華民國時代、東三省所組成之滿洲、已爲中國他省移民完全開放、此項移民取得土地後、已有種種方面、使東省成爲中國本部、在長城以北之延長部分、東三省人口約三千萬、其中漢人及與漢族同化之滿人、佔二千八百萬、且於張作霖父子時代、中國人民以及中國人之利益、對於發展及組織東三省經濟利源、較前尤爲重要、同時日本在滿洲所獲取或要求之權利、其影響所及、足以限制中國主權之行使、此項限制之情形及程度、殊屬逾越常軌、例如日本之治理遼東租借地、公然行使與完全主權相等之權利、又日本以南滿鐵路、爲中國管理聯路地、必包括多數之城市、以友人烟稠密之要鎭、在内、增如瀋陽長春等地、日本在此數處、管理警政稅所敎育、以及公用事業、並在各處駐紮軍隊、如遼東租租借地内之關東軍、鐵路地帶内之路警、以及各處領館之警察、此種狀態、如係雙方澈底、了解之密切經濟及政治合作之表現、或可長外繼續、不致發生縀紛後不斷之爭執、但因無上述條件、此種狀態、終必引起雙方誤會及衝突、兩方權利之相互關係、法律狀况之有時不能確定、以及日本特殊地位之觀念、與中國國家思想之益形對峙、又爲許多爭執後糾紛之源也、（五）在一九三一年九月十八日以前、每一方在東省對於對方均有正當之不平理由、因日本利用有疑問之權利、而中國則阻碍無疑問的權利之行使、在九一八事件發生以前之最近期内、中日兩方曾竭力以外交談判之通常方法與和平手段、解决兩方懸案、此項手段、並未用盡、但中日間在東省緊張之情勢、日見增加、且日方意見、主張必要時以武力解决一切懸案、（六）在中國目前所處之過渡及建設時期以内、雖有中央政府之努力、以及已經領得之極大進步、然政治上的騷亂、社會上的不安、以及分裂之趨勢、實爲過渡情形所必不能免、此所以必須運用國際合作之政策也、此項政策之一種方法、即在中國民使其在改造及鞏固其國家而請求之關於鞏固新制度之承認上帮助悉由國聯繼續依給之華盛頓會議席上所表之國際合作政策、其原則今仍有效、然迄未能實行者、要皆由於中國不時有激烈之排外宣傳也、由經濟抵制及學校之排外敎育兩方面、此項宣傳之發展、已造成使此次爭執爆發之空氣、（七）（九一八）前中國爲表示對某事之憤慨、或圖援助某項要求、而實行之抵貨運動、足使已形緊張之局勢、更趨緊張、九一八事件後之抵制日貨、則屬國際報復之舉、（八）國聯盟約對於解决爭取之規定、其目的係在制止、足使國家與國家不免决裂之緊張局勢、國聯調查團認爲中日間之一切爭執、均可用公斷程序解决、但中日爭執之彙集的增加、已使兩國間關係更形緊張、因此自覺取損之國家、於外交談判過分延長之時、有不得不喚起國聯對於此次局勢之注意、且國聯盟約第十二條所載、（一）聯合會會員約定、倘聯合會會員間、發生爭議、勢將决裂者、當將此事提出公斷、或依法津手續解决、或交行政院審查、並約定無論如何、非决公斷員裁决、或法庭判决、或行政院報吿後三個月屆滿以前、不得從事戰　、（二）在本條内、無論何案公斷員之裁决或法许庭之判决、應於相當時間發表、而行政院之報吿、應自爭議移付之日起六個月成立、（九）自一九三一年九月十八日夜、至習日爲止、當地日軍官或許自信其行動出於自衛、此種可能、不必斷定其爲必無、但日軍是夜在瀋陽、以東省他處之軍事行動、國聯大會不能認爲自衛手段、即日本嗣後在爭執進行中所採取之全部軍事行動、亦不能認爲自衛手段、且一國之採取自衛手段、並不免除其遵守盟約第十二條之義務、（十）自九一八後、日軍當局之行政後軍事之活動、于基本上係受政治理由所驅使、日方在東省繼續前進之軍事的佔領、使東省一切重要城鎭、均脫離中國當局之支配、並于每次佔領之後、行政機關、必經一度之改組、日本軍政官憲　組施行滿洲之獨立行動、藉謀解决九一八後滿洲之狀况、並利用某某中國之名義及行動、以及素來不滿于中國當局之某某少數份子、與地方團體、以期達到此項目的、此種運動、係受日本參謀部之援助與指導、其所以能實行者、端賴日軍之存在、不能認爲自動後眞實之獨立運動、（一）前段所述運動、所當生之滿洲國政府、其主要政治及行政權、均操諸日本官憲、及日籍顧問之手中、彼輩所居地位、足使其實在的指揮及支配東省行政、在東省佔人口大多數之中國人、大抵均不擁護此種政府、並視爲日人之工具、滿洲一國于調查團完成報吿書後、尙未經行政院大會討論以前、得日本之承認、惟尙未得其他任何一國之承認、國聯盟約國特别認爲此項承認、與一九三二年三月十一日决議案之精神不合、引起九一八事件之情形、實具有一種特殊之色彩、隨後因日本軍事動作之進展、滿洲國政府之產生及日本對該政府之承認、情勢更形擴大、此案旣非此國對于彼國不先利用國聯盟約所定調解之機會而遽行宣戰之事件、亦非此一鄰國以武力侵犯彼一鄰國邊界之一簡單案件、殆無疑義、因就上述情形而言、東省具有許多特點外世界其他各地所能確切比擬者也、然日本軍隊未經宣戰、將中國領土之一大部份、强行侵領、且使其與中國分離、宣布獨立、則又爲不爭之事實、國聯行政院、于其一九三一年九月三十日决議案中、提及日方聲明、謂日本軍隊業經開始撤退、日本當以日本人民生命財產之安全、有切確之保證、爲此增明繼續將其軍隊從速撤退至鐵路區域以内、并希望從速完全實行此項旨願、又於一九三一年十二月十日决議案中、重申九月三十日之决議、提及當事兩方承諾採取必要辦法、防止情勢之再行擴大、並遏制任何行動、致再令發生戰爭及喪失性命之事、關於此案、應請注意者、國聯盟約第十條、曾規定會員國、應遵重其他會員國之領土完整、及政治之獨立、又盟約第十三條、曾規定會員國同意、凡會員國間遇有事端足以引起彼此决裂者、願將爭端提交公斷、或依法律解决、或由行政院予以調查、在九一八事變以前、原來之緊張狀况、其責任在當事兩方、但九一八事變後、中國不負任何責任、</p>
<p>第四部　建議之叙述　本部係各機關於此次爭執事件、大會所視爲公允通令之建議、</p>
<p>第一節　　大會之建議係注意本案異常特殊之情形、並以下列各項原則條件及觀念爲基礎、（甲）本爭執事件解决之辧法、須遵守國聯盟約·非戰公約·及華盛頓九國條約之規定、查盟約第十</p>

<p>批評報吿書　據孫氏談、國聯十九國特委會之報吿書、對九一八事變之責任、確定應由日本負但、對僞組織亦不予承認、並邀美俄兩國參加各點、均甚公正、可表示滿意、然主要之關鍵、尙在國聯能否依照報吿書實行、換言之、即能不决心制裁違背盟約之國家、據日内瓦傳來之消息、列强對於對日經濟絕交、</p>
<p>尙抱遲疑之態度、國聯若果不能以經濟絕交之手段、以制裁違背盟約之日本、則此項報吿書、亦係一紙空文耳、</p>
<p>廢止特别法　目前我國除刑法以外、尙有危害民國緊急治罪法等各項特别法、同時行使殊覺不便、目前立法院正從事修正刑法之工作、擬將各項特别法之罪刑、一律包括在内、俾修正之刑法施生時、各項特别法可一律廢止矣、</p>

<p>丨劉文俊君來信丨</p>
<p>世界急進的輪子陷在失業的洪流中了。輪子儘管前進，失業洪流却像瀑布似的在流！這是一個大的問題，人們應該好像大患臨頭似的有所顧慮，雖然這是誰也不能立卽解决的一件事。大爆發大毁滅將在目前，不僅是日本人的飛機和槍砲驚破了人們的迷夢，目前的危境人們也應自驚而起的！</p>
<p>上海是活的力流轉的社會，也是瀑布奔流的最急處。我們不能再迷信繁華的都市的活的力會灌活人們的鮮花，也不要夢想不能實現的憧憬！了解社會，要向社會的深處瞧暗處瞧！深暗處確蘊藏着推歷史的輪子的最大的力！</p>
<p>這深暗處儘有的是失業者。先生，讓我們瞧瞧我們困苦的同胞和他們的被救與否。在滬南，有幾個庇寒所設立在冬天是慈善團主辦的。這當然是我們困苦的同胞庇寒的塲所。所裏平民是滿壓壓的，還有許多職員掮着恕臉爲慈善者施幸福。他們是否能盡心盡力地完成他們的使命，我這裏不說，但他們驅使平民的鞭子却常握在手裏，去年召平民來今年揮平民去，雖然來時去時是一樣的酷寒，（據說寒庇所將於現在酷寒的時候解散，或者已經有解散的）現在春雪紛飛冷氣不下嚴冬的時候在馬路上衖口裏，又能看得見我們困苦的同胞了！</p>
<p>先生，社會上少數人享受不作工，多數人民成爲難民。幸而還能托「有錢人」的福能稍庇寒凍，但是「來時去時是一樣的酷寒」我眞不懂慈善者，也是有錢的人，爲什麽一定要我們這班困苦的同胞嘗受　大雪紛飛下寒冷的酷點！富人對貧者施慈悲，貧者應有何等的感激，但是出庇寒所時的大雪又打寒了他們感謝的熱心！</p>
<p>我要問先生的在下面：「現實的環境將有大毁滅，失業者便是其中的中心，而失業的問題也要俟毁滅後始能解决。慈善者　施善不過是調和劑，」我這個猜想和預料是否正確？先生對於失業問題有何意見？并對於現今慈善者的態度有何評言？這　是我求答的！</p>
<p>失業問題是凡百問題的先决問題，慈善問題是失業問題的產品。這都是重要的，請先生多所創論！</p>
<p>答：足下所提出的問題非常重要，可說是現社會之最中心的問題，謹就所見，答復如下；㈠失業是現社會的一般現象，也就是現社會丨資本主義社會之必然的結果，這個問題在中國固然是非常嚴重，則在歐美也是同樣的嚴重，誠如來書所云：『現實的環境將有大毁滅···失業問題也要俟毁滅後始能解决。』不過這種毁滅只是數少的人羣的毁滅，即舊制度，舊組織，中單享受不作工人們的毁滅，㈡我們對於慈善團體的態度也和足下一樣，因爲慈善團體，給牠一個最高的評價，也不過是一種頭痛醫頭，脚痛醫脚的辦法。老實說，人到了失業沒工作，沒飯吃，沒衣着，並且眼睜睜地看着老婆孩子『啼饑號寒』，那就去做賊做匪，還有何路可走。不過我們却是一樣地反對，爲什麽呢？就因爲這種行動不能解决這種社會現象的根本問題，並且使一般貧民『流氓』化，結果，失却了革命性，倒反成了前途的大障碍，因爲他們的生活浪漫了，變成了『今朝有酒今朝醉』的心理，上海的現象表現得非常明顯、足下說：『慈善團體是失業問題的產品』是對的；然而若說：『失業間題是凡百問題的先决問題』，那就有商量的餘地了。因爲要解决失業問題，不能單就失業問題本身着想，就是說失業者大衆的眼光不能只注在經濟的鬥爭，尤當注在政治的改善。</p>

<p>紐約十七日電吿一週棉市狀况云、本週原棉市况鬆動、其故爲合作社經紀人之了結與售出、蜜歇根州銀行停止付現八天之辦法、及他處小銀行多家停閉之消息、凡此事件、皆具令人不寗之勢力也、此外棉貨需求之减少、亦爲市况鬆動之原因、惟原棉價格之跌風、已在六月期每磅六分左右價格上、爲同業買風復作所阻遏、近日市况已覺穩定、購才現待市况之發展、棉帶近來溫度可認爲已至足以减少蟄伏中果蠧蟲之低度、各處報吿、仍有棉田增多之表示、國内農業救濟支配案、已爲參議院農業委員會所通過、但受監者僅以種小麥與棉花者爲限、而節制農田限制生產則已被删除、因之難以實施有效的監視也、據華盛區私人消息、史蜜斯案較有可通過之機會、但若干方面對此案之能否通過、仍抱疑念、</p>

<p>（滬南）昨來源有二十五六號、銷路零碎、城鄕店客略動、包胃則客商仍屬觀望、僅行家上棧辦進五六百石、浦中存積以累日到源較稀、去路尙佳、故已輕薄、而售方則都思做俏、市况因之驟現轉活、蘇同帮米價遂高角許、靑角薄秈以來源不夥、故包胃雖微、市形尙可、南港帮厚薄等米、則以到銷兩平、供求相合、市價居定、杜洋尖乏貨胃香、客家居奇、故不以客尖影響所牽制、價帶高角許、變陰元貨寡銷滯、市無軒輊、至於市上所用之五斗及六斗市斛、外界不明眞相、有所謬悞、故今經南北米行同業議决、祇可俱用五斗市斛、六斗斛一律廢棄、以符統一量器之法令云、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨日河下各帮到船四十一二號、白粳銷路本街略化、四鄕乏交、市形又小一二角、薄稻到小銷平、價形高定中次帶軟、早稻來源續有、去路較呆、價小尺許、羊埠尖及杜尖到銷兩和、價稍帶軟、客尖定立、陰元定勢、白元疲勢之格</p>
<p>客秈銷暢市穩</p>
<h3 id="c185">本街有代辦軍米說 <a href="#c185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>客秈昨日市銷、愈開愈暢、本街與福州帮去胃均旺、統市共開七千包相近、爲多日未有之成交數、上午福州帮購去江西機晚米九百七十包、價八元六角至五角、又湖南紅糙米七百六十七包、價六元七角、本街則辦湖南機紅米四百七十六包、價八元一角、及江西機晚米一千包、價八元七角三分至五角五分、市况與價格、漸覺平定、至下午開盤、福州帮辦興尤佳、續購湘紅糙米五百三十三包、價仍六元七角、至本街下午去胃更旺、再辦江西晚米二千餘包、價八元七角三分、次至八元四角·又湖南機油米九百餘包、價八元四角至五角、以上本街購進之貨、聞說由南市某行代辦軍需、故下市形勢、更形穩定、</p>

<p>（標粉）　昨日粉市、上午開盤後、各月份忽見暴騰之象、以洋麥報價、雖無上落、惟因謠傳澳麥停裝之說、致人心大爲衝動、其實北方之時局雖緊、國際間之交通、斷不至卽受影響、惟人心易受打擊、又因各廠之現粉、可以照標準直抽、不再加價、北路客帮、遂齊起抽買、本月份開價最高至一兩八錢一分半、較前日計漲三分外、遠期各月份、亦帶高一二分不等、迨至下午開盤、初仍緊張、後則微呈平定、因阜豐及小廠、仍有出檔、且匯率已鬆、後步恐防洋麥之續定、人心因之微頓、至津帮抽定標準、同阜豐已達十七萬、福新達十五萬、故近期粉之上落、當看後步之抽裝情形也、結果本月份較前日漲二分半、三月份漲二分、四月份漲二分二厘半、五月份漲七厘半、六七月份漲一分半云、</p>
<p>（期麥）　昨日麥市、上下午開盤後、各月份呈初平繼俏之象、上午各盤、因洋麥無甚上落、人心平平、惟本月份開價高二分之譜、遠期亦稍帶起、迨至下午開盤、各月份開盤、大致平穩、因買者業外居多、以此地步、轉多觀望、致行家之套頭、雖有餘額、亦因時局之故、不肯多出、因之遂成擯局、結果本月份較前日不動、三月份漲二分、四月份漲三分、七月份漲二分、</p>
<p>餘無比較云、</p>
<p>又十七日電、芝加哥小麥、因空頭補進及出口需要較佳而淡、又上日成交共一千萬蒲歇爾、茲將行市列左、</p>

<p>昨黃豆市暫居盤旋之勢、廠家辦胃稍接、共成交火車豆七車、市形因見大連市續疲、故人心帶虚、惟到積兩稀、餅銷已開展、故豆市之前途、漸有穩定之望、豆餅廠方仍扳售、昨成交乃行家回出之貨、故市略軟、惟廠盤仍須一兩三錢六分之譜、紅豆廣帮採辦五六百包、市因貨稀仍居平穩、油市昨見勢閙、市况亦定、</p>

<p>昨日糖市、公會劃盤二四粗砂白十五兩六、成交僅一百袋、蓋今日適値星期日、銷方無裝出故也、二十號中砂白及八九十號荷赤均祇呌盤、絕無劃出、交易異常淸淡、建冰大來華續開五福白冰三十五箱、每砠價十三兩、市勢堅定、行方雖望略　日但貨底單薄、終不能如願、潮帮大順復到綿湖白七十六件、據云貨品比前更佳、或有提升之可能、此外刁靑潮靑均以進户無意、並未續開、</p>

<p>行盤隨升二三兩</p>
<p>木耳邇來以到貨稀少、客盤異常堅緊、如馬蘭坪耳開至六十二兩半、四川耳六十二兩、前後漲起四兩、惟銷路方面、廣帮因新秤關係、雙方尙在擯持中、現僅福建泉州興化等帮稍有成交、故行盤未能漲足、昨市什耳售五十八兩、亦有呌六十兩者、此前亦升二三兩、趨勢頗緊、</p>

<p>華絲運美僅三百餘件</p>
<p>自日本人造絲價跌之消息證實後、滬埠歐美人造絲市均呈不振、加以匯市緊張、價益趨疲、内地各綢商對於期現絲均抱觀望、市氣淸疲、昨祇川帮在公會上續進二·三月份Ｂ級人造絲三十六箱、價均續跌五錢至七錢半云、</p>
<p>又訊、華絲美銷仍無起色、輸出亦難轉暢、昨美郵傑克遜輪由滬赴美、乾利等祇有黃白灰各絲經三百二十四件裝往紐約舊金山埠云、</p>

<p>柏油於最近兩旬來、市勢頗銳、漢油漲起五兩光景、浙油加上七八元、旋因漢市預售之貨、久不解齊、而來源又異常稀少、不得不暫行停止現貨買賣、須待售出貨解齊後、再談交易、市塲岑寂、已屆一週、聞連日所到、除解前售外、仍無餘積、致後盤漲跌、尙未可知、惟浙油因漲風太盛、雖免見危、售者較多、辦者反成觀望、形勢似稍疲軟、然因上江產地年令不豐、產額大减、近日雖市面漲後已有到貨、乃總不若往年之盛、且杭行底積本薄、故市縱見疲、地位尙固、過廉實非售者所願、以現市而論、祇大漲小鬆而已、本埠行家及燭淘、均無存底、客貨亦所到無幾、銷塲因淘家夏作籌備尙早、心存觀望、不甚暢旺、而行家旣無手貨、亦不願將價過於閙漲、現售重荊二十三兩、平荊二十二兩二四錢、麻城高貨二十二兩、小潮貨二十一兩七八錢、惟以往年而論、皂廠正在需貨之時、迄未聞有辦過、若皂銷有動、則市面又當别論、</p>

<p>昨五金交易、尙覺熱閙、如天津靑島烟台以及長江沿岸各帮、均有採辦、是以成交尙覺可觀、惟所辦之貨、多屬零星、所以市情益爲浩繁、查其間黑鐵皮開出最多、因此市貨有靑黃不接之象、標準飛漲、每担行情可估至九兩五錢、而厚花色亦可開至八兩七錢半之谱、但市貨奇少、同業爲預防將來斷擋起見、莫不向洋行媾訂期貨、聞昨定訂二百噸、價每噸爲十磅○二先令六便士、查係英商某洋行定出、馬口鐵昨日天津靑島各帮辦去千餘箱、行情殊少上落、英鋼板購者甚衆、但市貨少、致成交不多、行情二厘半、每担爲八兩五錢、半分六兩七錢半、七釐半每担爲六　五錢、一分六兩二錢半、比前均漲錢許、厚花色則殊少開出、其餘每担在六兩光景、黑鐵釘新鉛絲雖長江帮俱有點綴、但成交寥少、所以行情無甚變遷、新洋元三角鐵工字鐵白鐵瓦等除有問津外、殊少點綴、而行情一節、則因人氣良佳、所以尙無下游之勢、此外各市昨日殊無交易、而價格亦無甚漲跌、</p>

<h3 id="c218">飛鳥哲學 <a href="#c218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>— 樊仲雲</p>
<p>闊别了數年的伏園老人，最近忽有機緣相遇於上海街頭，在宴飲中間，他還是那樣一口口地喝酒，那樣從容不迫地說笑，</p>
<p>記起數年前聚首的光景，眞令人不勝留戀呢。</p>
<p>對於伏園老人，印象最深的是他的所謂飛鳥哲學。但這可不是理想主義的詩人的思想、而爲他對於女性的見解。他原沒有這樣的名稱，這是我給他加上去的，那時，他在上海主編貢獻旬刋。</p>
<p>伏園老人以爲女子猶如飛鳥，應當讓其在枝頭林間自由地飛翔，倘若捕而禁之籠中，那末雖然跳得怎樣輕快活潑，啼得怎樣淸脆嘹喨，到底不免缺乏生意。且以囚禁籠中之故，往往糞汚狼藉，沾染衣服，成爲大殺風景的事。因此，女子凡是在街上的時候，定比在家中爲活潑愛嬌，値人愛戀。别人的老婆所以好，便是這個緣故，因爲我們的與之相見常是在她能比較自由地飛翔的時候。</p>
<p>這個見解，在一般女權主義者看來，當然是侮辱女性。但實則不然，這正是嚴酷的事實。因爲直到今日，女子在社會的存在，仍不過是一頭鳥，她是人們的玩物。經濟的鐵索，以婚姻與家庭的形式，束縛着她，使她不克自由。鳥還可以衝破樊籠，覓食於林間，女子則絕對不能打開男子的天羅地網。職業婦女算是解放了，然而依舊免不了以性爲其生活手段。學校敎育宜平能打破這種恶習了，但是到底還是玩物或裝飾品的敎育，結婚職業的敎育。公司女店員何故須以容貎爲甄别的標準？部長要人何以必須求耦於其所主的大學？甚至女學士何以必須擇配於一般鍍金或銀的公子哥兒？明白了這些，我們便可思過半了。</p>
<p>總之，眞正的自由，必須去除經濟的束縛。否則，戀愛免不了帶着銅臭，結婚直是一種長期賣淫的職業。鳥有兩翼，力能飛翔，當鳥兒自覺到這些束縛的時候，自由的天地或者不遠了罷。</p>
<p>記起了伏園老人，因於其離上海他去之次日，寫此以爲紀念。並祝其對於改造社會的敎育事業的成功。</p>
<h3 id="c219">說眞話 <a href="#c219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>— 張夢麟</p>
<p>人家都知蕭伯訥是丑角，說他善於說笑話。蕭伯訥說「我說的是眞話，世間最大的笑話，便是說眞話」。</p>
<p>說眞話丨丨這便是蕭老先生五十年來大聲疾呼的口號。他的論文，他的小說，他的劇作，都是以這個使命爲中心。幾十年來，他不憚煩地把那些說假話來遮蓋自已的行動的英雄，說假話的中產階級，說假話的普羅列達里亞，說假話的女人，說假話的政府等等指給我們看。把他們言行不一致的滑稽暴露出來，呌我們看看這便是近代文明。</p>
<p>愈是自私自利的人，愈是說得出正大堂皇的理由。愈是貪贓枉法牟官吏，愈是會說保障人權；愈是會享樂的摩登男女，愈是說得出跳舞救國等等，等等。於是我們就常在報章上看見許多言論，勸這些人照着所說的話去做。蕭伯訥說，這便是理想主義者丨丨不敢直面現實的理想主義者。言行不一致的人，是因爲他不敢直面他所行的眞實理由，所以想了一個假的，正大堂皇的理由來代替。同樣，這些勸他們照着所說去做的人，也是在遮掩視實，理想地以爲只類果能如何說的那樣高尙地去行動。現實主義者，就知道全不是這回事。人們還在進化的過程中，還不能完全，這些嘴上所說的高尙道德，還談不到。所以人類的自私自利，貪婪亨樂，當然是意中事。可是我們若果能直面這個現實，還可以想出改善的辦法，人還是不斷地向前進化的。所以蕭伯訥的主張，便是人怎樣行動都行，照着你的本能去做，可是不要做的是一樣，想的又是一樣丨丨丨說眞話！他要求我們的，不是要我們行如我們的言，是要我們言如我們的行。這一點，蕭伯訥又把我們的因襲思想，給顚倒過來了。他常常玩這個把戲。</p>
<p>那麽，照蕭伯訥的主張，豈不是善惡都不分了嗎？蕭老先生，就在ＭajorＢabrara中答應這個理想主義者的問題　　「善惡！你以　你活了　多歲，起碼可以辨别善惡嗎？哼！什麽是善，什麽是惡　自孔子　　拉底以來。幾千年中，絞了無數上智者的腦血，還在爭論不出一個結果呢。你以爲你就　了嗎？</p>
<p>所以人們只有照着本能所命地做去。直面你爲什麽這樣做的動機。到了你本能地覺到這種行爲不對的時候，你就會想法子改了。假若你只會用口實來遮蓋着這現實的話，你一世也改不了，便是你一世也進化不成，再高等的動物。那末，就有比你更高等的動物，（蕭老先生所謂超人）出現了來，拿你對持猴子的手段，來對待你了。</p>
<p>蕭伯訥說人類不錯是現在最高等的動物。可是生物的進化，並不是到人類即止，因而人類非保存不了，並沒有理由。你對待其他下等動物的手段，爲什麽地你更高的動物，不能拿來對待你呢？</p>
<p>據說一兩年前曾有一位大雜誌的編輯先生，不遠千里，跑來問蕭老先生一個問題，在他以爲這個問題的蕭伯訥式回答，一定使世人感覺很大的興味。他的問題是在蕭伯訥的意中，現代誰是最寳貴的，是文化，進步最不可缺的人。他</p>
<p>「假若人類突然遭了全滅的運命，而你老先生，就如創世紀中所載的Ｎaah一樣，可以有力，留一點人種，那末你留那一個人呢？」</p>
<p>蕭老先生帶着謎似的微笑答道：</p>
<p>「我一個也不留。」</p>
<p>蕭伯訥對於現代人類，非常悲觀，可是對於生物進化，抱有極大的希望。</p>
<p>現在他到中國來了，不幸而正當帝國主義的日本侵略我們的時候，這個使我們想起他在歐戰時的態度來，在那個時候，英國有人說他，「協約國一面和德國打仗，一面和蕭伯訥打仗。」全英國人民都在痛詆德人的時候，他却出人意外，大駡起英國政府來。若是在中國的話，早被槍决了。</p>
<p>當時他的態度，可以在戲曲「傷心之室」中看出。戰爭是近代文明的結果。受近代文明影響的，不只是這一國，而沒有那一國，不只是這一階級，而沒有那一階級，近代文明所墮落的，是全人類。所以德國人固然該駡，英國人更該駡。全英國人民在駡别人的時候就忘記了自已，因此，蕭老先生只好出來說眞話了。</p>
<p>第二次在戰又要展開了。也許蕭老先生還要說一次眞話！　（完）</p>
<h3 id="c220">黑女求神記（五） <a href="#c220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>— 蕭伯訥作宜釋</p>
<p>這不是辯論：這是　誚，黑女孩子說。「你似乎沒有知道辯論是什麽呢。』</p>
<p>「唷！我是全世界都承認折服了約伯的，那有不知道辯論是什麽的道理！我單是笑你罷了，孩子。』那老紳士說，他很動氣，却也驚愕到不能完全領略當前的光景了。</p>
<p>『你笑我，我並不在意』，黑女孩子說；『然而，你爲什麽不造一切都好的世界以代替好和壞的混合呢，這緣故你却還沒有吿訴我。我自已是否能够將牠造的更好些，這樣能問我是算不得回答的。如果我是神，吸血蠅（註）就不會有了。我的人民就不會發急病而跌倒，生可怕的瘤，以及種種犯的罪了。别種蛇是沒有毒襄也能够活的，爲什麽你偏放一個毒襄在一猛白』的嘴裏呢？爲什麽將猴子造的這麽醜，而將鳥造的這麽美呢？』</p>
<p>（註）南亞非利加所產的毒蠅</p>
<p>『爲什麽我不可以這樣呢？』那老紳士說。『這一層，你回答我。』</p>
<p>『你爲什麽可以這樣呢？除非你是有着作惡的嗜好的，』黑女孩子說。</p>
<p>『問難題算不得辯論』他說。『這算不得是玩這個把戲。』</p>
<p>『不能回答我的問題的神於我是沒有用處的，黑女孩子說。『况且，如果一切東西眞是你所造的，你該知道你爲什麽將鯨魚造的像他在圖畫裏那麽　的緣故罷。』</p>
<p>『如果我特意造成他有趣的模樣以取樂，那於你有什麽相干呢？』他說。『你是什麽人，竟敢敎導我，怎樣來造各種的物事。』</p>
<p>『我對於你，覺得壓倦了，』黑女孩子說。『你老是發一種壞脾氣的。我不相信你曾經造過什麽東西。約伯沒有看出你來，一定是很笨的人。在這森林裏冒充着神的老人們太多了』</p>
<p>她擎起『諾勃凱黎』來，向他撲過夫；然而他却敏捷地鑽到桌子底下了，那張桌子，她覺得一定是已經沈落到地下去了；因爲當她到了那桌子邊的時候，那邊就什麽也沒有了。待到她再去檢點她的聖書的時候，風從那里又攫去了三十頁，將塵埃似的牠撒在樹林上了。</p>
<p>在這番經歷之後黑女孩子分明覺得煩悶了。她不曾見到神：她的聖書一半毁壞了；她有兩次得不到怎樣的滿意，着了惱了。她開始自問：自已可不曾白鬍子和老年和睡衣作爲神聖的信物，過分看重了麽？當她碰見了一個穿着希臘服裝，頭臉修剃得光潔的非常漂亮的白少年時候，她的心情是那麽樣，這是幸運的事。她先前從未見過像他這樣的傢伙。特别是，他的兩道眉毛的外邊的角上，有着堅起和扭曲的樣子，這是使她覺得有趣，也覺得嫌厭的。</p>
<p>「對不起，先生」，她說。「你生着一雙懂事的眼睛呢。我正在尋求神。你能够指引我麽？」　　「不要這樣的討麻煩呵，」那少年說。「世界怎樣就怎麽樣罷；因爲世界以外，就什麽也沒有了。一切道路的盡頭都是墳墓，這就是虚無的門；在虚無煌陰影裏，什麽都是空幻。聽我的勸吿罷，不要再尋求到你的鼻尖以外去呵。你會常常知道這以外有着什麽的；知道了這你就幸福而且有望了。「</p>
<h3 id="c221">回去吿訴你媽媽 <a href="#c221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>— 陽秋</p>
<p>蕭伯訥在香港時，對路透訪員說：「中國報界中人何以無一訪余者，彼等其幼穉至於未識余乎？」這兩句話眞熱辣辣地很有點令我們難受！可是我們的蕭先生也許忘記了他前年在蘇聯時一個小姑娘所給予他的敎訓罷。故事是這樣的：</p>
<p>蕭伯訥前年在蘇聯時，有一天，同着一國呌做×××的小姑娘玩了很久，分别的時候，蕭對她說：「你回去吿訴你媽媽，今天同你玩的就是世界在名的ＧeorgeＢernerdＳhaw。」可是這位小姑娘畢竟是太「幼穉」了，她竟不識蕭爲何許人，立刻毫不遲疑的彷照蕭的口氣對蕭說：「你也回去吿訴你媽媽，說今天同你玩的就是×　　姑娘！」</p>
<p>蕭這故事還沒曾忘記罷！</p>
<h3 id="c222">談蕭伯訥（續） <a href="#c222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>— 林語堂</p>
<p>㈢蕭伯納論耶穌</p>
<p>據蕭伯納言（安得羅克利思與獅之序言），耶穌是革命的理想家，是共產公妻論之始祖。亨傳說據蕭的意見，世界愈進步，愈證明耶穌道理之偉大。據蕭氏的解釋，耶穌的敎訓，槪要有四條，第二條是：</p>
<p>『廢除產業，併入公家。你的工作應全脫離酬勞關係。如果你讓一小孩挨餓，便是讓上帝挨餓。撇開一切關於明天衣食的計慮，因你不能服事兩個主人：上帝與財神。』第四條是；　　『廢除你家庭的牽累。凡天下的母親都像是生你的母親。天下的人都像是與你同胞的兄弟。不要爲喪事而費你的光陰：注意生，不要注意死：海裏的魚跟灘上的魚一樣好，並且更好。天國是在你的内心，而在天國裏，是沒有嫁娶的，因爲你一生不能服事兩個主人：上帝及你所嫁或娶的人。』</p>
<p>但是對於耶穌個人做基督，自稱上帝之子，能復活升天等傳說，蕭伯納是絕對排斥的。尤新奇的，就是他不相信耶穌的性格是溫良的。慈愛的，人道的，悲壯的，哲學的，都可以說，但不能說他是溫良。蕭氏說：</p>
<p>『稱耶穌爲溫良、謙虚而柔弱，這是卑鄙的近代的假托，在福音書中，毫無根據。』</p>
<p>其實東西偉大的人格，都被小人誤認。就是我們的孔子可水嘗是溫良恭儉讓？貎似陽虎，何嘗溫？一方堕費，一方欲往見以費叛的公山弗擾，又騙蒲人不適衛而出圍，出圍後適衛而主張伐蒲，何嘗良？不見孺悲便罷，又必取瑟而歌，與人難堪，何嘗恭？狐貉之厚以居，什麽也不食，什麽也不食，何嘗儉？不肯賣車葬顏回，何嘗讓？所以我們只好學孟子說：『然而無有乎爾，則亦無有乎爾』。我們若肯不帶眼鏡去重讀論語，孔子的人格自會活躍紙上。</p>

<p>東華立此不朽奇功、固賴於人人努力、無而論功行賞、守衛人員、成績均佳、下半時更如天衣無縫、而周賢言挽救十二碼、尤引爲美談、前鋒五人、萬象華陳　添恍如二枝精兵、所向無敵、陳家球尙不愧善於應付之大將、李義臣雖中二球、乃掠人之美、而躊躇好盤諸習、猶未脫去、全才暫不敢稱、將俟諸異日、曹秋亭初臨大敵、侷促不安、此乃成功前必經之階級、不可自餒、東華二次有失守之能、卒能死　　生、自助天助、各占其半、</p>

<p>阿伽爾五前鋒、奔跑迅速、聯絡佳妙、射擊猛疾、三美並俱、於是東華門前、時見强敵壓境、然而十二碼之未中、空間而不入、一得一失、有　全軍銳勢、中衛綫之功守齊能、並較東華出色、所不如者、内衛及守門耳、全局觀勢、阿伽爾之失敗、每在　鋒盛勢之中、忽而對方疾入、　　　　、一鼓而下、四球之失、多半　此、</p>

<p>東華倍受敵人壓迫、多扼守、隘相與低抗、獨萬象華孤軍在外、當二十五分鐘時陳家球遙與接濟、萬氏放馬直入、巧避海斯汀、陶兌計失措、一球傳中、陳虞添準時駕到、近間咫尺、一撥入網、中央開球、阿伽爾努力進展、乃遭馮運佑之阻、反趨本陣、李義臣中途截得、提起一脚、飛入門内、又五分鐘、曹秋亭忽得球、迅傳與萬氏、奔前三步、傳向中央、落於李義臣之前、後容蹴入、三球之得、共十分鐘、而觀衆之　駭、我軍之氣壯以及敵人之膽寒、均同時並至、</p>

<p>阿伽爾進負三球、士氣奮發、精銳前鋒、又活躍於東華四隅、彼時果非東華守衛之堅、刻刻有失守之虞、萬象華又一　進展、顧中部接濟稍遲、坐見守門救出、阿伽爾前鋒、在海氏指揮之下、分遒疾進、吳幼良奪球撞人、指爲犯規、罰十二碼、中鋒惠列主踼　歲寒而知松柏、周賢言竟在無可挽回之中、扑地球之、從此東華軍心穩定、上半時三對零占先、</p>

<p>優游足球隊昨仁與蘭開夏作西聯甲組賽於中華棒球塲結果優游以四比一勝、觀者二三千人、茲紀經過情形如下、</p>
<p>優游隊陣容一新　優游隊羅致人才、力事操練、冀圖恢復昔日三育時代之英名、自香港孫錦順黃華加入後、實力鞏固多多、今復得綽號火車頭之陳光耀來滬加入、陣容乃益爲完整、昨日陣君首次出塲、與孫錦順極有聯絡、右面胡有成董小培奚巧生三人固屬老搭擋、前線故頗見强勁、前衛與　衛、亦格外小心、是以昨日之優游、更非昔比矣、</p>
<p>蘭開夏球藝一般　此蘭開夏、非以前之蘭開夏矣、此係一星期前、由倫敦來滬調防以前之蘭開夏軍隊者、至於該隊實力、仁與昔之相仿、前鋒與前衛、均極出色、各個技術、當推中鋒史密斯最爲勇敢、惜後衛稍弱、難防守耳、</p>
<p>外國人先開紀錄　鐘鳴三下、裁判員勃脫下令動員、優游開球先攻、困於對方前衛線之儼守、未得其路而入、球常在敵軍脚上、三分鐘後、陳光耀踼出角球、孫錦順攻門太高、失去機會、蘭開夏卽行還殺、邊陲入寇、葉晋明失守、錢耀彬阻擋不及、被中鋒史密斯打開龍口、先負一球、</p>
<p>董小培單槍匹馬　冷不防優游先失一球、英軍債怒、卽興師問罪、董小培與奚巧生短傳逼進、左路先鋒策應而上、通過敵軍前衛、董小培單槍匹馬、乘對方内部空虚、浩浩蕩蕩、直搗龍門、至相當地點、一舉成功、乃成各一之比、</p>
<p>孫鐵脚坐收漁利　從此優游軍威益盛、三軍奮發、黃瑞華殺出重圍、交與孫錦順、孫被所阻、卽短傳與董小培、董帶前幾步、舉脚掃射、球爲敵守門撲住、但守門乘勢跌地、球落身旁、孫鐵脚見機趕上、坐收漁利、優游遂以二比一估優於上半時、</p>
<p>孫胡又各建一功　　鼓三通、再戰、肇起、敵軍報復心切一格外努力、優游乘勝餘威、　言示弱、五分鐘時、奚巧生邊陲進兵、至適當地點、高球逆中、胡有成頭頂入門、又越二分鐘、陳光　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　着地　入網中、殊見功夫、優游隊以四比　勝　　結果四與二之比　斯時之優游、可謂盛極一時、左衝右突、　是勇敢、惟蘭開夏受此重創、心猶不甘、時見興師問罪、苦於優游警戒森嚴、無𨻶可乘、直至末了倘餖餘七分鐘時、蘭開夏左内路伍特攻入一球、乃以四比二之結果、優游造成第二次之勝績、雙方出塲陣線如下、</p>

<p>丨西靑以三十九比三十六勝</p>
<p>上半時滬僅得四分實爲致命傷</p>
<p>後日三次决賽</p>
<p>昨晚滬江與西靑之上海籃球會甲組首次决賽、上半時中、滬江陣容慌亂、擲籃不中、竟噕爲於一籌莫展、反見見西靑　虎撲食、英勇無比、使滬江進不能攻、退不能守、祇聞干餘觀衆長吁嗟嘆、掃興非凡、西靑共得二十二分、滬江僅得四分耳、如此比數、誠出於意料之外下半時中、形勢大爲緊張、滬江一變上半時慌張膽怯之狀、而成生龍活虎之勁軍、於是觀衆復展開笑顏、極力聲援、奈何上半時所負過多、卒以三分之差、慘敗於西靑、比數爲三十六比三十九、裁判員張國勳舒鴻、觀衆達千餘人、爲本季籃球賽第一次盛况</p>

<p>八時過半、滬江先行出塲、繼之碧眼兒西靑健兒、亦戎裝出塲、雙方略試投擲後、裁判員下開賽、滬江卽處處受敵、招架不遑、齊爾史密斯籃下偷擲、兩舉兩中、吳國霖奮勇搶球、籃前投中、成四比二、以爲分庭相抗、形勢當然緊張、詎料滬江困於嚴守施展不得、吳國霖頻頻遠射、毫無目標、局勢反爲一面倒、西靑左右逢源、得心應手、白乃特史密斯西萊齊爾、圍攻籃下、一再得分、而滬江奄奄無生氣、四面楚歌、防不勝防、比數竟成二十二與四之比、末後由孫寳慶打中一球、上半時終了、遂成二十二比四、形勢如此令人頓足而嘆、</p>
<h3 id="c259">再戰聲起形勢一變 <a href="#c259" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e259" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">259</a></h3>
<p>滬江受此重創後、極力振作、再戰聲起、努力奮鬥、形勢突然一變、比數遂漸追上日觀者狂呼呐喊、球塲空氣、驟然緊張、孫寳慶兩發兩中、精神興奮日史密斯立卽還報、馮念華亦加一球、斯時之西靑、依然隢勇、不稍示弱、齊爾亦加二球、以爲滬江仍在壓迫之中、難於施展身手、混　多時、比數相差僅十、聲援者、聲厮力極、耳爲之　、滬江精神乃益爲奮發、孫寳慶尤爲勇敢、最後五分鐘時、滬江氣𦦨愈熾、吳國霖、屢次遠射、均能�</p>
<p>命中、孫寳慶向前助戰、勞苦功高、馮念華錢敬鏞亦不辱使命、浩浩蕩蕩、殺得興高采烈、球癮未闌、比賽忽行終止、察看比數、爲三十九比三十六、滬江以三分惜敗、</p>

<p>首次决賽、滬江敗矣、其失敗原因、當在上半時之一蹶不振、如能多中兩球、滬江卽得勝矣、區區中四分、誠爲滬江歷史上後未有之紀錄、豈昨日命在該失敗乎、良人莫解究竟、往才已矣、二次决賽、瞬在下星期二、報仇雪恨、望滬江好自爲之、至於昨晚之戰、西靑以白乃特爲最出色、前後招顧、勇而不慌、奔跑搶奪、迅捷穩健、特拉裏表演平平、齊爾史密斯屢失機會、擲籃猶未見十分準確、匹萊處勇如昔、全隊陣容鞏固、聯絡一氣、無懈可擊、滬江以孫寳慶最出色、卽以得分而論、孫爲兩隊之冠、共得十四分、陸鍾恩已成落伍者、僅能運籌帷幄、臨陣則頗現慌張、馮念華錢敬鏞、大小吃虧、每歎不得活動之地、吳國霖尙有可觀、全隊工作、宜力求鎭靜爲妙、昨戰成績如下、</p>

<p>丨縫窮婆與摩登姑娘丨</p>
<p>誰都不肯去追求和描寫的江北縫窮婆、伊的服飾和職業，太沒有美術化了！深黑的抺頭布表現着來自江北的色彩，罩一件，外面靑鬆鬆　面一包葱』的藍布衫，下面單衩褲兒紮脚管，坐着一隻隨帶出門的　化竹椅，交叉着伸長的雙腿，脚上兀自穿一雙落伍已久的尖頭女鞋，在夕陽光中低着頭做伊的縫紉工作。身旁放一隻元寳藍兒，裏面！雜裝着布頭布腦針線剪刀，以及一切的縫紉工具。　出口來，總是說着拉塊長拉塊短的話；來來往往的人向伊行注目禮的，十個裏面覓不到一個。</p>
<p>頭上燙着數十塊銀一次的鬈髮，身上扳着千金一　的貂皮大衣，下幅露出一截五光十色的華貴族袍，高跟皮鞋的跟　舊時菜館中高裝的排南一般兒伶仃。細長的眉兒，雪白的臉兒，猩紅的唇兒，處處可以表示着化妝品的權威。一陣陣的香風做伊的先頭步隊，打從縫窮婆的面前經過，益發見得縫窮婆似塵　土飯，而這位摩登姑娘似末化身，這是多麽美術化啊！</p>
<p>過了一天，美術化的摩登姑娘又打從縫窮婆的面前經過；爲着街道修　　理未竣緣故，伊右脚所穿的高跟皮鞋竟在崎嶇的石子上别去了後跟，而變爲一隻低跟一隻高跟的崎形鞋子。伊眞窘極了！待要回去，旣不能行這一脚高一脚低的路；待要買鞋，又離着「皇后鞋莊」有半里之遙。伊傾側着身子在道旁候車，充分表現欲出風頭而忽搠霉頭的　𡯓面孔。�</p>
<p>縫窮婆在縫紉的時候，微微的抬起伊的石脚道：「我的鞋兒是自已做的，從來不曾别去了後跟；便是偶有破損，馬上脫下來，縫這幾針便好了。候什麽車，尋什麽鞋莊呢？」</p>
<p>縫窮婆說這話時，態度很閑暇，理由也很充足；但是，躡着崎形皮鞋的摩登姑娘，一聽這話，伊的面孔益發尴𡯓化了！唉！伊的美術化破產了！</p>

<p>天色是那樣的陰沉越現出黃昏時候的黑暗了，這時，在福州路與望平街的交叉路角上，擁擠着一羣異樣行色的人在胡亂的排列在路的兩側，說笑的聲浪在那一段的空氣間震蕩着。他們的衣着很單薄，有些在抱着肩膀發抖，有些在跥着脚跳；由他們面部的表情看去，充分的象徵出他們内心的期待。</p>

<p>— 顧明道</p>
<p>凱君到瞧伊施着脂粉的面龐和猩紅的櫻唇，不覺想到了外人的流言。自已雖是一個開通的人，然而一見之後，終覺得伊流露着艷意。古人說：「艷如桃李，凛若冰霜。」平均得很好。現在伊有桃李的　華，而無冰霜的凛烈，宛如玫的酒，充滿着甜意，難免不有人　涏欲滳啊！伊先和凱君母子招呼後，便走至凱君之前，對凱君微微一笑道：「我有一件事情和你商量，要得你的同意，······」伊的話還沒有說完，凱君聽了，不由一怔，不覺把筆放下，便問道：「菊嫂有什麽要和我講？」伊又笑了一笑道；「我的身世可憐，是凱哥早已知道的，我也不用細說。我想長此以往，斷非久計，很要出去找些職業，解决我的生活，不要這樣的過着無聊的日子而一無倚賴，危險得很。可是我的學問實在不夠，談不到去找職業，所以我從今日起，要立志求學了，也使我他日看些學識，謀個自立之道，不致再捱受這種無限期的痛苦。然而我沒有人帮助，無錢去入學校，而且年齡又不小了，也難考入，最好的方法就是自已補習。補習要得良師的指敎，方能成就。凱哥是最好的良師了。我已購得一册英文讀本，要懇求你每天敎我一小時，不論早晚，祇等有空的時候。你們是可憐我的，大槪總能允許我。他日若有成功，我當感激不盡，不知凱哥意下如何？伊說這話時，雙目緊瞧着凱君，態度是非常懇切。</p>
<p>凱君聽了伊的要求，暗想原來爲的這個問題，伊說得這樣懇切，使人家不能不帮忙；况且我身爲學校敎師，天天要敎授人家的，對於伊怎能拒絕？而且照情理　講去，這也是一件好事情。把學問灌輸給一個孤苦可憐的女子，好使伊將來謀到生活上的自立，在人道主義上當然是功德無量而義不容辭的。倘然自已還絕了，不知伊要怎樣的懊惱呢？在他囁嚅着沒有即答的當兒，凱君的母親在旁也表示着贊成的意思，凱君心中竟不容有考慮的餘地而遽應許了。這天以後，凱君的書室中多了一個特别女弟子，時間是不一定的，因伊要乘凱君空暇的時候，然而多數是在黃昏。伊除補習英文而外，也時當要敎凱君指點伊的中文。　（三）</p>
<h3 id="c267">尊重女性 <a href="#c267" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e267" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">267</a></h3>
<p>— 賢賢</p>
<p>丨不重生男重生女丨</p>
<p>西方人尊重女性，女子穿大氅，男子服侍，女子出門，男子開門恭候，女子坐電車，男子起立讓座，不拘甚麽事，凡男子可以效勞的，都不得躱懶，這是一種金科玉律。如敢故違，就夠不上文明國大國民的頭銜。野蠻得如我們中國的老百姓，經專習禮貎的留學生回國提倡，更由洋塲才子實行，竟把一等野　國的地位，提高到了三等文明國。努力提倡奉行，非但其功非小，眞是厥功碕奇偉。</p>
<p>但是，且慢，這種文明，是否是歐風東瀨，據我看，還有研究一番，推敲一下的價値。所謂尊重女性，充極其量，不過對於在世的女性，不可侮辱，小覷，而加以尊敬罷了。這種尊重女性，是屬於後天的。而且對於女子的一切禮貎，究竟是因習俗與禮敎的關係，總不免扭扭揑揑，有些勉强做作的氣味。我們中國，不吹牛，不扯謊，有書爲證，在大唐朝時代，在民衆的普遍思想中，已有不重生男重生女的觀念。這種觀念，是對於肚中一塊肉說的，完全是先天的。而且這種觀念，完全是内心表現，絕對不是說風凉話。外國人開口閉口尊重女性，但是生了太子，放一百零一砲，生了公主，祇放二十一砲，怎及得我國的不重生男重生女來得十足道地。</p>
<p>歐美各國有新奇發明，中國人說了一句中國在數千年前已曉得使用了，往往給外國人當作話柄，把嘴都笑歪了，說中國人都有誇大狂的。但是我現在又說尊重女性那回事，中國人比西方人奉行得早，不知又要給洋大人或準洋太人笑話麽？</p>

<p>— 銀屏</p>
<p>以前有一位很聰明的王子，遠近國家的王子和公主們，都慕名來拜謂他。有一次他見到了一位很美麗的公主，很想娶伊，但是他雖是很聰明，可是不知道愛情是什麽。他很直爽地問這位公主：「你願做我的妻子嗎？」</p>
<p>「你連一些求愛的話都不會說，怎夠稱聰明，我怎願做你的妻子呢」？</p>
<p>「我甚麽都知道，除了愛情」。王子說。</p>
<p>「那你快去學習吧」！</p>
<p>王子於是便離了她去學習愛情去了。</p>
<p>×　　×　　×　　×</p>
<p>他最初碰到了春，春天握着水瓶，頭上戴着花冠，像年輕的婦人。王子便問伊：「愛情是什麽」。</p>
<p>「愛情使你沉醉」。春無力地伸着伊疲惓的四肢回答：</p>
<p>王子再向前走，逢到了夏。他又這樣地問伊。夏回答說：「愛情使你痛苦」。</p>
<p>再過去又見了秋，秋靜默着不作聲，一句話也不說，伊祇樹葉飛散在風裏，好像表示着說：「愛情使你愁悶」。</p>
<p>王子到冬的身旁，見伊穿着皚白的衣裳，伊的話在嚴肅中說着：「愛情是滅亡」。</p>
<p>×　　×　　×　　×</p>
<p>我們知道這位聰明的王子是不會完全實說的。當他到那位公主的地方，他說：「現在我聽到了不少關於愛情的話，伊們都說，愛情是生命，是幸福。現在你願意嫁給我做妻子嗎」？</p>
<p>於是公主就做了他的妻子。</p>
<h3 id="c269">跳房子 <a href="#c269" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e269" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">269</a></h3>
<p>— 張亦庵</p>
<p>『跳房子是上海兒童的一種普遍的遊戲，最初的來歷不可稽考，不過在上海做過小孩子的大槪總懂得這種遊戲。我想這種遊戲同平滑的水門汀地面是頗有因緣的吧。</p>
<p>現在且把跳房子的遊戲法介紹於下。</p>
<p>人數自兩人至四五人。</p>
<p>擇平滑的地面一塊，水門汀地最爲適合。在地上用白粉畫作若干方形，作一列或兩列，每列有方形幾個，可以臨時酌定。每個方形面積約縱橫二尺。此種方形即象徵「房子」。</p>
<p>各人備小磚一塊，或其他有相當重量的二三寸大小的東西，如石塊，鐵塊，銅塊等。</p>
<p>遊戲法　第一人以小磚擲入第一房子内，屈一足，單脚跳入，卽以此脚將磚踼出房子之外，然後跳出。在房子内時，屈起的脚不能着地</p>
<p>跳出房子外之後，將小磚塊拾起，投入第二房子裏，又單脚跳入第一房子，由第一房子再跳入第二房子，然後又將小磚塊踼出。</p>
<p>以後每間房子都照此跳一次，直至將所有各間房子均跳過而不犯規，投擲跳踼均無誤者，那就是第一次成功了，他可以任意領取一所房子（方形），在這房子裏用白粉寫上自已的記號他人跳時，不得踐踏其内。</p>
<p>如是數人依次輪跳，直到把所有房子都領取了便算完結一盤。</p>
<p>這是『跳房子』的最普通玩法，此外還有别出心裁，加上些新鮮花樣的，這裏不復一一備述　　『跳』本來是七八歲至十一二歲的孩子所最喜歡的一種動作，這是與他們的生理心理都很有關係的，而效果能使他們心理覺得滿足，生理上可以得着發育堅强，舉動活潑的幫助。『跳房子』是一種有規則，有組織，有趣味的跳法，値得鼓勵提倡的。我想將來上海的小學校大可以專闢一片地給小朋友們做這種遊戲吧。</p>
<p>要注意的是跳的時候宜用足掌前部，最好着橡膠底鞋。</p>

<p>— 樸</p>
<p>英國在今日有兩位聞名全球的學者，一位就是轟動一時前夜方離滬的七十七歲老翁蕭伯納氏；另一位就是十二年前曾來華講過學的哲學家羅素先生。我們知道他俩均以觀察深刻名於世，羅素氏於</p>
<p>游華後曾發表類多關於揄揚中國古代文化的文字，輯有專册，銷路</p>
<p>頗廣。可惜此次這位蕭老頭兒到中國的時間太短，而經過的地方，又大都爲香港·上海（連上海的南北市區及鄕間農村都沒有看到）等歐化的所在，於是有人以爲很難希望他能給我們什麽深刻的批評；但是有兩點是他老人家不要經過觀察而早已預聞的丨丨現在更身臨其地，尤其是看到香港，上海的一班文人學者以及路上熙熙攘攘的商販，苦力所表現的。第一點就是中國目前「苦無文化之可言」，據昨日本報記者所發表的蕭氏談話中有這樣幾句批評中國的話：「按文化一義、如照科學解釋，即爲凡一切人類行爲之可以增進人類幸福者，尤其是對於大自然之控制，在中國除田鄕間尙可尋求其少許文化外，此外殊無文化之可言。中國今日乃向西歐搬取許多已經失其效用遺害大衆之所謂「文化」，如議會制度，敎育方法等等有何益處。」我們對於這種批評要進一步說明的就是蕭氏之所謂「中國無文化之可言」應作爲「中國之舊文化日就湮沒，而新文化尙未興起」的意思來解釋，就沒有語病了。因爲蕭氏並未見中國農村的眞面目，他沒有嘗到一點兒中國文化的味道，他所批評的，僅爲他的一種智慧的想像罷了。但是他這種想像的批評，與他的朋友羅素所揄揚的出發點，並不衝突，因爲羅氏遍游内地，對於吾國農村風俗，内地習尙，均有相當的考察與探討他所分析的對象，就是以蕭氏所想像的「田鄕間」爲根據的。不過現在時隔十數年，我们國家的景况，可說是一年壞一年，而農村經濟的崩潰，尤爲顯著的事實，這也許是羅素先生所不及料的了。</p>
<p>第二點，蕭氏所知道的，就是中國民衆的無組織，因此他對香港學生的勸勉，是呌他們要有組織有計劃的去革命，日前他在上海的言論中，亦以此義爲發揮的重心。</p>
<p>我們總觀昨日蕭氏所發表的意見，在表面上對於這無文化無組織的民族出路問題，似乎沒有什麽特别的建議，但實際上固已給我們一個很明顯而具體的暗示了。他說中國搬取已經失去效用遺害大衆的西歐文化，那就是說中國要謀民族的出路，應根據自已「田鄕間少許可尋的文化」重新發揚光大！本着科學的文化定義，共同增進人類幸福的大道努力前進，他說改造現狀的革命方法，是要有組織與有計劃的奮鬥，方有成效。</p>
<p>我們看到目前這種國破家亡，民不聊生的景象，我們若不願做「待亡人」而仍有自救决心的，則對於這過路的老朋友所給我們的暗示，就應當表示誠意的接受，一致向着這「創造新的文化」，「組織起來自救」的兩條道猛進。在這生死存亡的關頭，可沒有我們猶豫和觀望的時候了。</p>

<p>我去年因爲家鄕水災逃到上海，先是做小生意，但還不到半年資本虧蝕罄盡，不得已托人到紗廠去找工做，又久久未成，後來花了三塊錢，總算在浦東大康紗廠裏找到了。那天報名的人眞多啊丨簡直是人山人海，擁擠得水洩不通，使膽小的我不禁嚇了一跳。報了名，等一會，大家就都排了隊伍站着，高高低低，猶如一隊娘子軍。這時便有東洋人前來挑選，小脚不要，尖脚也很危險，醜的固然不要，臉上有麻子的更不要，每個人都鴉雀無聲的聽憑選擇，和從前考功名一般。遇有不要的，就用拳頭，向後一推，把她推下隊去。被推的人，心裏旣感失望，肉體復招苦痛，眞使人氣憤極了。接着，又有醫生前來檢騐身體，用器械放在我們胸部上靜聽，前看後看，摸手摸脚的，忙個不了，只要被尋出一點小病就不要的。再後，打手印，拍小照，問話。等一切手續都做完了，第二天乃發卡片，准許上工，並派拿摩溫來指導工作。這般生手女工的工資是很少的，但工作却很苦，我在進廠的時候，眞呌我流一身汗呢丨我現在總算是進廠做工了，我看廠裏的女工，不論生手熟手，動不動就要挨東洋赤佬的拳打脚踢，眞令人害怕啊！</p>

<p>「喂！外面有人麽？走一個進來。」一個又響又尖的聲音，從後面廚房裏喊了出來。</p>
<p>其實，我早已聽見了，可是，我還是只當沒有聽見似的依然我掃我的地。</p>
<p>這並不是我偷懶，老實說，我們這幾個師兄弟中，還算我勤謹些哩！雖然我自已也不能說我是怎樣的勤。</p>
<p>我實在不願見那猙獰可怖的師母娘那副吃人似的兇險，從我進店以來，創也足足有十個月了，可是我從來沒有見以她和言悅色的對我們說一句話過。這次她的命令，可又來了，我心裏想，我裝聾，我的師兄弟總會有一個進去的吧！可是事實殊出我意料之外，他們竟和我包同一態度，各做各的事，誰都不應一聲。</p>
<p>「外面人到底有不啦！」師母娘催促的命令又來了。</p>
<p>「×！聽見麽？你師母在呌你！」賬房毛先生，一手捧着水烟筒，一手拿着紙吹，從賬房間裏，邊吹邊踱將出來。他不喊這個，不喊那個，偏偏會喊着我。</p>
<p>這我可不能再挨了。一壁忙應着：「喔！來了」，一壁忙把塵埃掃到一角落裏後，飛也似的奔了進去。</p>
<p>「怎麽！我呌你沒有聽見麽？懶賊！」</p>
<p>「不！我應過了哩！我正在客堂裏掃地啦！師母！」</p>
<p>幸虧我回答得快，喊了堀聲「師母」，否則一頓臭駡又難免了。</p>
<p>「哪！到萬通醬園去買兩塊錢生油，一塊錢醬油，快些來！」她說着，順手交了我三塊錢。</p>
<p>我早已曉得裏面喊是沒有好差使的，門外落着這樣鵝毛似的大雪，又要到距離半里外遠的醬園裏去買油醬了，可是，爲人學徒，有什麽法子呢！</p>
<p>從廚房的暗角落裏拖出了兩隻油膩膩黑沉沉的甏，一手揑了一隻，冒着雪，走出了後門，甏是滑的，手不得不用力地揑，手背上開𨻶的皮膚，滲出來點�</p>
<p>點血痕，雪飄了上去，受溫熱化了水，過一會，滿手都是紅了，像是塗了層紅墨水。脚下套了雙套鞋，在雪上踏，凍得爛凍瘡又痛又癢，可是，爲人學徒，還得向前走！</p>
<p>遠遠的遠遠的在那邊牆上遙見「萬通」兩個大字，我心裏平替了無窮安慰，雖然那裏是沒有煤爐火盆，但至少總可以給我享受少時間的休息。由於内心的歡悅，脚底下不禁加緊了步武。</p>
<p>滑············雪的無情，將要到目的地了，還要使我溜一交！手脚是呆了，倒還可以勉强爬起來。回顧地上，那雪裏映着一塊紅。總算還好，我全身檢視之下，右手背上擦去了一塊皮，幸虧是麻木了，暫時還不覺行痛，但是，可惱啊！右手揑着的甏是碰碎了。</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>我朝着雪堆裏的甏瓣，呆了半晌，不知將如何是好，想與其回去給師母一頓挨駡，倒不如在外面買一隻來較爲爽快，摸摸棉襖袋裏，半月前毛先生給我的八角錢月規錢，倒還有六角在這裏，可是賠了一只甏，這半月的剃頭，冼衣，沐浴等錢，又從何而來呢？否則受她整天的駡，忍受得住的麽？想了半天，「揮財不如爭氣」，畢竟憑我一股勇氣，賠了甏，買好了油醬回來。</p>
<p>脚一跨進後門，兩隻甏連忙仍向那暗角落裏一塞，頭也不回的奔到前面客堂裏來了，果然，「小鬼！這許多時候才來，定在外面游蕩」的聲音，又從裏面傳了出來。</p>
<p>我眞冒失了，創了手，賠了錢，還要受她這樣埋怨，我恨不得轉過身去和她爭論一下，可是想到學徒半途而返的不名譽，一股怨氣，和熱涙復向肚裏抑了下去。</p>

<p>— 鐸非</p>
<p>店員慢客，足以使營業受着重大的打擊，這是誰也不能否認的事實。</p>
<p>我覺得凡是來照顧我們的客人，我們都應認他抱着一種好意，决沒有輕慢他的道理。雖然有許多客人，進得門來，東張西顧、瞧瞧熱閙，並沒有决心要買什麽東西；或是揀來選去，終於一樣貨物沒有買成；然而他在最近的將來，實有變爲我們眞正顧客的可能；假如我們輕慢了他，那麽就會永遠失去了這位顧客。顧客揀選貨物，無論如何苛細，那是他應有的權利；他如果問問這，又問問那，我們負有盡量吿知的義務；我們切不可厭煩，表示出一種不高興的神氣。有些不大漂亮的顧客，於貨物包紮之後，付給貨欵的時候，硬要抺尾少零；我們祇有好言解說，請他原諒。假如他因爲不肯减讓而口出不遜之言；我們也祇能認爲是極無知的人，不必加以計較。我們店員的勝利是什麽？是在能將交易做成；縱然做不成，我們的貨物仍在，也喫不了虧。</p>
<p>我們對於任何顧客的態度，須要謙和，誠懇，忍耐。不但店員服務應當如此，同時也是我們做人不可缺少的美德。</p>
<p>北方的店員，對於顧客進門，不論識與不識，必定委親熱的含笑致問：「你老好呀：𠴰們多久不見啦！」顧客付給貨欵的時候，也必客客氣氣的說：「你老不必給錢，這帶着花（用的意思）吧！」此雖不免過分的虚僞，不足爲法，但他們的態度，是何等謙和呵！漢口的店員，很有不少的人對於議價未成的顧客，動輒以白眼相加，說：「来要開葷吧！」開葷兩字的意義，就是譏剌你從來不知肉味，不必想在此開葷；這不但是「慢」而已矣，簡直是給顧客以重大的侮辱；顧客不能容忍，所以往往由相駡而至於相打起來。你想做交易而做到與顧客相駡相打，那不是成了笑話嗎？江浙的店員，似得很小這種惡習，縱慢客也不會慢到如此程度，不過那一副冷冰冰的不大理睬人的面孔，却也使顧客夠受了。</p>
<p>但他們所慢的客，多數是些衣服樸素帶點鄕氣的人；對於衣服都麗舉止豪闊的大人先生太太少爺小姐們，非惟不敢慢，而且常常反要準備大肚皮裝他們的氣。</p>
<p>我覺得凡是照顧我們的客人，無論他是遠官偉人，或是癟三化子，在我們眼睛裏都是一樣的顧客；我們不應當因所做交易的大小，顧客階級的貴賤，而抱着勢利的心理，加以歧視；我們無論對於任何顧客，總要取着謙和，誠懇，忍耐，的態度，同樣的應付。</p>
<p>我的結論是丨我們不要輕慢癟三化子的顧客，我們也不必對於大人先生們脅肩諂笑，特别恭維，我們更不必頭上搽着「斯丹康」，臉上塗着「雪花膏」，油腔滑調，嬉皮涎臉的特别巴結太太小姐。祇要是顧客，我們都要一視同仁，同時我們不要忘掉謙和，誠懇，忍耐，三椿必具的美德！</p>

<p>— 文煥</p>
<p>在現下畸形發展的社會中，因社會組織的不合理，一般的生活日漸抬高，廣泛的無產階級羣，大家都忙着找飯碗，那有時間給他們去讀書呢。小孩子一出母胎，就被視做全家生產者的一員，只要有噉飯的地方，就把他推進商店的門檻，使他負起全家庭中他所應負的相當荷負，以减輕父兄的重擔。其餘一切，都是次要的問題。就是有資質聰頴的子弟，具備求學的材料，可是國爲環境的關係，都被剝削了；或是正在求學的時期，也得離開學校的生活，到社會上去自尋生活。在這樣的社會組織下，也不知埋沒了多少天才，斷送了多少的靑年人。</p>
<p>反面的事實，是人浮於事，學生一出校門，就馬上失業了。在學校時滿懷改造社會的雄心，到現在反被社會軟化了，犧牲了。在這昏黑的年頭兒，一切部門，無往而不伴着企業組合的形式而托拉斯化。一個初出茅蘆的靑年，無疑的是到處壁壘森嚴，不得其門而入；除非你是有大脚力的。無不深深的陷在碰壁的塲合中。你不要看見報紙上的徵求欄和聘請欄，天天在招考人員，那拆穿的說起來，只不過是收一大批的報名費，揩揩大家的油而已。所招考的名額，已給有大脚力的捷足先登了。在這樣的狀態之下，不怕你是舶來品的洋貨，也罷，十足道地的國貨也罷，同樣都找不到出路。這顯然是敎育和職業的解體，「所學非所用，所用非所學」，就是牠的最大的特徵。</p>
<p>從這兩方面看來，一方面是因找職業而犧牲了求學的機會，他方面是求學畢業倒反得不到職業的矛盾事實。這顯然是現社會制度的產兒，因爲現社會的本質是商品代的。反映在敎育上的也是充滿着商品化的内容，使敎育成爲少數有孔方兄階級的私有物，大多數無產階級羣都被擯棄在受敎育的範圍之外；同時商品化的結果，使敎育與生產都是一樣的不計社會的需要，而盲目的大量生產的。因此在產業上形成生產過剩，造成失業的恐慌；在敎育上也是形成人才過剩，文氓激增，引起找職業的困難。所以這是社會根本的問題，需要一個澈底的解决，使這不合理的社會很迅速的崩潰下去，代以合理的平等的社會組織。到那個社會裏，自然沒有過剩的現象發生。到那時敎育是大家所共享的，學生只要一出校門，就有他能力所能勝任的工作給他去做，絕不會有失業的危険，像現在的蘇俄一樣。但是在未達到那個社會的現階段中，大家必須具最大的努力，在可能的範圍内，求得高尙的學問和謀得相當的職業，以補救其萬一於現過程中。</p>

<p>在淸晨擁擠着的向外灘進發和電車車廂裏，我嘗獃獃地細看過每個同胞乘客的面孔，我每每發覺得，第一個面孔，都是在黃色之中，帶了些蒼白的色彩，充分的表現着「疲勞而不康健」。他們（我也是）大多數是工商界裏的小職員，爲了生活的驅使，不得不把疲倦尙未恢復的而且不康健的身體，又搬進寫字間裏去了！</p>
<p>固然，在現在世界經濟恐慌的情形之下，處在次殖民地的同胞。自然要爲了受生活的磨折而多帶幾分菜色，然而，我們同胞向來不注意體育，也未嘗不是一個原因。</p>
<p>注意體育麽？這又有困難來了。第一，在這尺土寸金的上海，除掉幾個資本家的花園裏可以作爲運動塲而外，大多數人家的天井，還不滿二十方尺，散步且不能，更那能談到運動？第二，運動器具呢，又那一件不要錢買？網球拍，足球，籃球，鐵啞鈴，練膀臂的彈簧練······許許多多奇奇怪怪的鍜練身體的頑意兒，又那一件不貴？我們這班二三十元一月薪俸陛級的小職員，更那裏有錢去買？所以，對於「運動」也者，亦只好望洋而興嘆了！</p>
<p>但是，我們不能因此就不鍜練身體，我們需要鐵一般的身體，比有錢的人還要需要，所以，我們在無可奈何之中，只好想出些「苦練」的方法來了。</p>
<p>在淸晨新鮮的空氣中，馬路是空闊得可愛，冷淸淸地沒有幾個人。在這時間中，我們可以約幾個同好的朋友，作一次比較長距離的賽跑，不要花一個錢，我們的兩條腿，就先得了康健的基礎（身體比較弱一點的人，可以改爲散步）。</p>
<p>腿是運動了，而兩條臂膀仍然是缺乏運動，這裏，我又想出一件「窮的器械」來，這器械如下圖：</p>
<p>ＡＢＣＤＥＦ</p>
<p>說明：Ａ木把手</p>
<p>Ｂ硬鉛絲</p>
<p>Ｃ牛筋（比做馬鞭用的廋一點）</p>
<p>Ｄ鐵心的滑車</p>
<p>Ｅ木柄（滑車裝置在下半部）</p>
<p>Ｆ重物　用洋麵一隻，内裝沙泥，</p>
<p>因爲沙泥可以漸漸加重）</p>
<p>裝成這個器械，大約不要一元錢。</p>
<p>做好後，可以懸掛在天花板上，要運動的時候，一手拿着Ａ，一手握着Ｅ，兩臂用力張開，然後慢慢的合攏，每天練習幾十下，不要到一個月的功夫，兩條臂膀，必定要堅硬詐多，但是要注意兩件事：㈠不要屏氣，㈡肩頭不要聳起來。</p>
<p>苦練啊！建立起康健來呀！</p>

<h3 id="e1">Geneva Cables Express Resolve to Resist; League of Nations Places Great Importance on It; Song Delivers Stirring Speech at Welcome Reception <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>(Geneva) Zhang Xueliang, Commander-in-Chief of the Northeastern Army, together with Song Ziwen, Acting President of the Executive Yuan, have recently arrived in Rehe and sent a telegram to the Chinese delegation in Geneva, which reads as follows: "The Chinese government and people have resolved to resist Japanese aggression and are now concentrating their forces to defend our territory. I and President Song have arrived in the capital of Rehe Province. The purpose of this trip is to complete the defense plan so that China's territorial integrity will not be subjected to constant Japanese threats. The Chinese government has previously endured humiliation and worked hard for a long time in the hope of sincerely preventing the situation from worsening, so that the League of Nations could find a basis for mediation in accordance with the Covenant and other treaties. However, the hope of mediation has been severed by Japan, and the hope of peace has been destroyed by Japan's military actions in Rehe, despite the League of Nations' serious objections, which are ignored. Japan's specious reasons for occupying Manchuria were to maintain treaty rights, but Japan's invasion of Rehe cannot be justified by this excuse, as no treaty involves this province. We have received orders from the central government to resist Japanese aggression and have the responsibility to defend our territory, which is supported by the people of the North. Please explain our position and attitude to the League of Nations and the world." This telegram has been translated and sent to the Secretariat of the League of Nations. (Havas Dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations attaches great importance to Zhang Xueliang and Song Ziwen's arrival in Rehe, believing that China has long been determined to resist Japan. Although Japan has threatened to withdraw from the League of Nations, no one here believes that Japan will actually do so. (Central News Agency Dispatch, 18th)</p>
<h3 id="e2">Chengde <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Song Ziwen, accompanied by Zhang Xueliang and Zhang Zuoxiang, arrived in Chengde. Song delivered a speech at the welcome reception, saying, "I, Ziwen, have been ordered to come north and have consulted with Acting Chairman Zhang and others in Peiping on resisting the enemy. Yesterday, I came to Rehe with Acting Chairman Zhang and Chief Commander Zhang to inspect the situation. I am extremely grateful to Chairman Tang and the military and civilian leaders for holding a meeting to welcome me. As a member of the nation and a member of the government, I feel it is my duty to work harder when the country is in crisis. This trip north, and my conversations with local people, have further convinced me that the defense of North China depends entirely on Rehe as a shield. Protecting Rehe is the only way to protect North China, and it also gives hope for the recovery of the lost three eastern provinces. If Rehe is lost, North China will be shaken, and the impact will be felt throughout the country. After observing the situation in Chengde, I feel even more the importance of Rehe, and the morale of the troops at the front and the indignation of the people in the rear are enough to inspire me. Now the Committee of Nineteen of the League of Nations has conducted a very detailed study and unanimously supports China's position. Although the Japanese militarists are strong and violent, they cannot resist the whole world with one country. Therefore, the final victory will belong to us, but we must still work hard ourselves and not rely entirely on others. The Japanese militarists will soon launch an offensive. Although our weapons and equipment are far inferior to theirs, with the consistent policy of our national government and people, and the consistent public opinion, our armed compatriots will sacrifice their precious lives at the front, and our national people will contribute money and effort in the rear. The final victory will belong to us. I, Ziwen, have already written to the generals at the front, stating that the national crisis is pressing. This is not the time for us to talk leisurely. I can only say briefly, I am willing to offer a million points of sincerity and advise all sectors of the country to eliminate prejudices, unite as one, and work hard to resist the enemy. I will also follow behind you, and as long as I am in office, I will fulfill my duty. All my compatriots in the country should take this to heart." (Special Dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>(Peiping) People here believe that the international situation in China has never been as serious as it is today since the Boxer Rebellion, regarding the impending war in Rehe Province. Although war has not yet been declared, the situation of war has already been formed. The Chinese and Japanese soldiers no longer have any differences of opinion, but are only waiting for battle. Finance Minister Song's visit to Peiping has greatly strengthened people's hearts and repeatedly stated that the whole country is willing to be the backing for the war of resistance against Japan, not just the battle of a corner of the northern military and people. This kind of frankness has long been hoped for. Now, talking with the responsible Chinese in the north, they do not show any signs of fanaticism, but only have a calm, firm determination to resist to the end. Public opinion is that the League of Nations has done its best and has given China a spiritual victory with its moral authority. The League of Nations can do nothing more than this. Now we can only rely on China to use its physical strength to fight for it. This kind of strength is what the League of Nations does not have. Peiping is still very peaceful, but the public feels that a tragic war will break out in a week or so. According to news from the three eastern provinces, the Japanese military's preparations have been completed, and Mutō's army is only waiting for the final hour to arrive. The Chinese side has also amassed a large army to prepare for resistance, including the volunteer army, totaling about 150,000 people. They are now waiting for the enemy's attack, and it is said that they are fully supplied with bullets. According to visitors from Rehe Province, the Chinese army is defending by relying on dangerous terrain, which is very advantageous. If the Rehe provincial army can show the same determination as the 19th Route Army in the Battle of Shanghai a year ago, then the Japanese military's plan to capture Chengde within a week seems likely to be thwarted. If the Chinese army's fighting ability is equal to its determination, then Rehe Province will become a thrilling battlefield, and the Battle of Shanghai last year was like military exercises.

<p>Military and civilian leaders from all parts of Rehe have gathered here to welcome Zhang Xueliang, Song Ziwen, and Zhang Zuoxiang. Zhang and others came here to complete the plan to resist the Japanese army's continued attack on Rehe. Today, the whole city is flying flags to show respect. Officials and people are extremely excited. Song Ziwen gave a speech to the public, which was extremely impassioned. At the end, he said that he represented the central government in declaring to the public that the national government would never give up the Northeast and never give up Rehe. Even if the enemy occupies Nanjing, no one will be willing to sign a treaty of surrender. (Reuters Dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>The League of Nations Assembly Opens on Monday, A Head-On Collision with Japan is Inevitable</p>
<h3 id="e4">Chairman Hymans Announces Failure of Mediation, Proceeds with Fourth Item Procedure; Japanese Cabinet Decides to First Recall Geneva Representatives and Consider Withdrawal from the League <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>The United States Does Not Make Formal Statement on League of Nations Recommendations for the Time Being</p>
<p>(Geneva) Chairman Hymans announced today that the League of Nations Assembly will open on Tuesday and issued a formal communiqué stating that all efforts to mediate the Sino-Japanese dispute have failed. Therefore, the Assembly must now proceed with its responsibilities under Article 15, Paragraph 4 of the Covenant and discuss the sanctions provided for under Article 16. The Chinese and Japanese representatives will speak first on that day. It is expected that the final vote can be taken on Friday. Neither the Chinese nor the Japanese representatives have the right to vote.</p>
<p>Judging from the news from Tokyo, the break between Japan and the League of Nations is only a matter of time, or perhaps just a matter of time. The League of Nations is not surprised by this, as it has already expected this result from the Manchurian proposal. Today's question is whether the League of Nations and the Disarmament Conference can survive this shock. Since Japan has withdrawn from the League of Nations, it is feared that it will also withdraw its representatives from the Disarmament Conference. Everyone feels that we should now find ways to increase the League of Nations' declining prestige, but the plans are diverse and we do not know which to follow. In addition to the Manchurian proposal, the gap between certain countries is now also becoming wider. (National Telegram, 18th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Assembly is scheduled to meet next Tuesday to consider the report of the Committee of Nineteen on the Sino-Japanese dispute. The understanding of the nature of its agenda is gradually taking shape. The important task is to formally record the provisions of Articles 15(3) to 15(4) of the League of Nations Covenant. It is unlikely that there will be a vote, but Chairman Hymans will make a statement explaining the overall situation and confirming that the recommendations made to Japan have been rejected, so the mediation procedure has failed. It is then expected that the Chinese and Japanese representatives will be asked to express their opinions. It is now believed that the Chinese representative has prepared a declaration, but the will of the Japanese side is still unclear. It is said that several members of the Assembly have opposed postponing the meeting on Tuesday to Friday. According to the rules of procedure of the meeting, at least two days' notice must be given before the next meeting can be convened, so the current procedure will not be changed. The responsibilities of the Committee of Nineteen have now legally come to an end. If further service is requested, there are organizational law concerns. It is said that the Swiss representative has stated that he does not wish to serve on the Committee of Nineteen. The acting chairman is now considering appointing a new committee in accordance with Article 3 of the League of Nations Covenant, but jurists here doubt whether this move requires unanimous consent. It is said that Hymans will come here from Brussels at the end of this week. (Reuters Dispatch, 18th)</p>

<p>The United States is Satisfied with the League of Nations Report</p>
<h3 id="e6">Content Matches Hoover's Doctrine <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>(Forceful Statement to be Made After Roosevelt Takes Office)</p>
<p>(Washington) Today, the US government has received the full text of the Committee of Nineteen's Manchurian proposal report and recommendations. The State Department is currently considering it and has made no statement. It is reported that the content of the report is actually consistent with President Hoover's policies in all aspects, and the recommendation to recognize China's basic sovereignty in Manchuria and the section on maintaining treaties are particularly in line with the US attitude. However, because the US government is about to change, and US officials also want world public opinion to be fully influenced by the report without any other opinions mixed in to distract the world and increase its complexity, they do not want to make any comments for the time being. Informal comments mostly claim that the report, which represents world opinion, is a promising sign that a satisfactory solution to the Manchurian proposal can be achieved in the end. The report will now be copied and sent to President-elect Roosevelt for review. Even if it is generally consistent with the intentions expressed by Wilson, it is expected that the US government will wait for Roosevelt to express his opinion before issuing a formal comment, and only after Roosevelt and Stimson have discussed it will it be possible to issue a formal statement. Roosevelt has not yet directly commented on the Manchurian proposal, only saying that the sanctity of treaties must be maintained. At present, people are speculating whether Roosevelt will mention this matter in his inaugural address on March 4. Chairman Borah of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee stated that the content of the report is what the world has a right to expect, but he believes that Japan will be unwilling for the League of Nations to take any action and will continue to implement its already announced plan. The United States is now waiting for the League of Nations' final action on this report. (National Telegram, 17th)</p>
<p>(Washington) The State Department stated today that whether the United States will participate in the League of Nations mediation committee for the Sino-Japanese dispute will be decided by Roosevelt after he takes office as president. It is also said that Senator Claude may be the new chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Today, it is claimed that the League of Nations report is too detailed to be criticized immediately, and it is not appropriate to announce a policy towards Manchuria without the decision of the new president. (Reuters Dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>The World Society translated Miller's Commentary report, saying, "How the Roosevelt government, which is about to take office, will deal with the Far East crisis cannot be known until the new president actually takes office and appoints a new Secretary of State. Until now, the leaders of the new government have only declared that their policies will not undergo fundamental changes and will continue Hoover and Stimson's policy of not recognizing Japan's acquisition of land based on the destruction of treaties. A person familiar with Washington's political situation recently wrote to this newspaper, and his words are recorded below: 'The United States' policy towards China is not a matter of Republican or Democratic policy, but a traditional policy that every government inherits without any substantive changes. But it must be known that Hoover and Roosevelt currently disagree on various issues. After the new government takes office, it may depart from the regulations of the previous government, which is natural. The attitudes of the two parties towards the Kellogg-Briand Pact during the election campaign were somewhat similar. Roosevelt has not yet expressed his opinion on the Japanese issue. People here are quite sorry that the Japanese are using an article written by Roosevelt after the Washington Conference in 1922 for propaganda. It must be known that the situation has changed greatly in the ten years since this article was written. In general, the Democratic Party is more friendly to the League of Nations, but it is too early to make any predictions based on this point. As far as the Democratic Party is concerned, it has less courage to adopt any policies that could lead to war. Some people predict that Roosevelt will be more friendly to China than Hoover, because Hoover was in Tianjin during the Boxer Rebellion and is therefore inevitably prejudiced. At present, a Democratic Party leader of a country, under the guidance of Roosevelt, is engaged in a serious and informal study of the Far Eastern situation in preparation for the new president's use after taking office. Domestic affairs and economic issues, war debts, and the International Economic Conference will take precedence over the Manchurian issue. There is a hope, often expressed among both Democrats and Republicans, that Japan will eventually collapse economically, so that the powers will be spared from taking any strong actions that could lead to dangerous situations.'"</p>
<p>(Washington) After studying the recommendations of the Committee of Nineteen, American legal experts stated today that whether the United States will participate in the actions that the League of Nations Assembly will take on the Manchurian proposal will largely depend on whether a US-Manchurian mechanism can be established to protect China's sovereignty and Japan's legitimate interests. These experts seem to agree with the report's statement that Japan's interests are facts that cannot be ignored, but on the one hand, these interests must be protected, while at the same time, full compliance with all treaties relating to this dispute must be insisted upon, which is a most tangled problem. The State Department must first resolve this before it can state the United States' position. The US government may not make a formal statement before the League of Nations takes final action on the report, but senators have already begun to discuss the report, and it appears that a large portion will oppose the United States' participation in a movement to put pressure on Japan, and many senators say that Japan will fully concede to allow negotiations to begin. It was also recently learned that President-elect Roosevelt will not have the opportunity to study the recommendations of the Committee of Nineteen for several days because of a prior appointment with a New York Democratic Party leader.

<p>Lytton Makes Important Statement Opposing Warfare to Safeguard Peace</p>
<h3 id="e7">Sanction Methods Should Be Decided by the Government <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>(London) Lord Lytton spoke today at Albert Hall in Manchester, referring to the remarks he made at a banquet of the Japanese Student Association in London last Tuesday night, saying, "Part of my speech to the Japanese Student Association on Tuesday has been disclosed by some London newspapers. Now I would like to make a slight statement on this. The banquet that night was a private gathering, and there were no reporters present. Although I do not object to the publication of my remarks, because what I said can be heard by the world, the way my remarks were relayed gave people an incorrect impression of what I said. During the banquet, people asked various questions, which I answered one by one. The person who published my remarks strung together my answers to various questions, leading readers to mistakenly believe that this was a coherent speech, while the questions asked to me at the time were deleted. I do not blame others for saying that I said something that I did not say, but the impression created by this news is that I expressed the opinion that if the League of Nations Assembly report is disregarded, then the League of Nations will no longer be able to take other actions. In fact, this is not my opinion, which is why I want to take this opportunity to correct this impression. If either party refuses to accept the assistance offered by the League of Nations and acts in a way that violates the Covenant, then the resources available to the League of Nations are not exhausted. I did express that I do not consider warfare to safeguard peace as a remedy. I did say that a worldwide economic blockade cutting off Japan's various exports would punish innocent civilians rather than the arrogant government, so it would be severe and could provoke a real state of war. But there are many other means of pressure that can be exercised, such as prohibiting the sale of munitions to the breaching country, or refusing financial assistance, or withdrawing diplomatic representatives. I am not saying that any of the above steps should be implemented now or at any time, because the timing and manner of exercising this pressure must be decided by the responsible government. I only want to make it clear that I am not saying that the above methods are not necessary methods that can be taken when necessary." (Reuters Dispatch, 17th)</p>

<h3 id="e9">The So-Called "Ultimatum" Appears Only After One and a Half Years of War <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>— Hui</p>
<p>(1) Proposals After the Nineteen-Nation Committee Suggestion</p>
<p>Since the League of Nations' Nineteen-Nation Committee put forward its proposals, the Japanese government has shown alarm, while the military has roared, believing that it should immediately withdraw from the League of Nations, implement its dreamed-of Monroe Doctrine of Asia, and carry out its "continental policy" to achieve the goals of annexing the three northeastern provinces and invading North China. This time, the Nineteen-Nation Committee's proposal does not recognize the Japanese army's violence in Shenyang on September 18th of the previous year as self-defense, and also suggests that League member states not recognize the "made-in-Japan puppet" 丨 "Manchukuo." The sincerity of its advocacy of "fairness" is especially worthy of our praise. However, there is no clear stipulation on the time and procedure for the withdrawal of the Japanese army. The territorial sovereignty of the three northeastern provinces should be restored first, otherwise it will eventually be a "flower in a mirror," with no power to implement it. Moreover, the League of Nations is only a moral sanctioning body, how can it make the Japanese warlords necessarily obey? Therefore, at a minimum, Article 16 of the Covenant must be used for economic blockade, so that Japanese militarists still know that the world has "fairness and justice," and that the nations can ultimately not be deceived, and China cannot be humiliated.</p>
<p>However, the Japanese cliques are strong and tyrannical by nature, relying on force both internally and externally. They not only want to annex "Manchuria" but also forcibly occupy Yuguan and garrison troops on the border of Liaoning and Rehe, and yet shamelessly praise themselves for maintaining peace in the Far East. In fact, it is the iron hand of Japan that is destroying peace in the Far East. It is also the Japanese warlords who are tearing up all international conventions. All enlightened people in the world recognize the violence of Japanese imperialism and feel injustice on behalf of our country. Although the incident has been delayed until now, from Liaoning and Jilin in northern Manchuria to Jinzhou and Yi County, and now even disaster has befallen Yuguan with the bombing of Rehe, on the one hand, it is due to the instability of the international political situation, and on the other hand, it is because our country has no real strength to support "fairness and justice." Therefore, the Japanese cabinet is allowed to act recklessly without restraint.</p>
<p>What is even worse is that the Japanese army is taking an inch and wanting a mile, provoking in Yuguan and demonstrating on the Rehe border, and even publicly stating that they will begin to attack Rehe on the 27th of this month, and that a large-scale battle will begin on March 1st. This is because March 1st is the anniversary of the Japanese army's creation of the ""Manchukuo puppet state." Therefore, the so-called "ultimatum" is prepared. The first one is sent by the so-called "Manchurian" government to Tang Yulin, the chairman of Rehe Province. The second one is sent by Muto Nobuyoshi, the commander of the Kwantung Army, to Zhang Xueliang, the chief of the three northeastern provinces in Beiping. The third one is sent by the Japanese government to the National Government. The wording is (Japan) strongly demands that Chinese troops withdraw from Rehe, because they believe that Rehe is "Manchurian" land. What is this! The Japanese militarist aggression is thus exposed without any disguise.</p>
<p>(2) Strange Statements from Japan</p>
<p>Japan has long had a dual diplomacy externally and a dual government internally. However, since the September 18th Incident, it has become even more obvious that the so-called Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the so-called Cabinet are merely echo chambers of the military, just like puppets. Therefore, whenever an incident occurs (especially those related to China-Japan affairs and the Northeast issue, involving international relations), the Japanese military must issue a strange statement to express the Japanese cliques' aggressive consciousness and their external strength. This time, the League of Nations Nineteen-Nation Committee declared responsibility, believing that the Manchukuo puppet was actually created by the Japanese cliques' army and has nothing to do with the 30 million people of the Northeast. Therefore, the Japanese army authorities issued another statement, believing that "Japan's recognition of 'Manchuria' is its national policy, and the attack on Rehe is not allowed to be interfered with by the League of Nations. Now that the League of Nations has rejected Japan's proposal and is questioning Japan, making it difficult for Japan, Japan has no need to answer. It is appropriate to immediately withdraw from the League of Nations."</p>
<p>What is even stranger is that Muto, the commander of the Kwantung Army, also issued a statement: "First, he praised the (puppet) 'Manchuria' he created. Second, he stated that the nations are gradually understanding the true meaning of the so-called kingdom of righteousness. Third, he said that the League of Nations is mired in the Lytton Report and ignores the 'current situation' of 'Manchukuo.' He also said, 'Japan cannot stand idly by and insists on peace in the East...'"</p>
<p>This kind of statement, except for Japan's own praise, all other responses are probably extremely discordant. After all, the violent acts of trampling on the territory of the Northeast, destroying peace in the East, tearing up all international conventions, and slaughtering our people, etc., are all actual manifestations of the Japanese army. The facts are obvious and cannot be concealed in any way. In the future, if its wild nature is unleashed, unless it is restrained with iron and blood, I am afraid it will never repent on its own, and its aggressive behavior will become more and more intense.</p>
<p>(3) Mediation Fails, Combat Begins</p>
<p>Japan does not recognize the mediation of the League of Nations, and insists on its aggressive claim of "recognizing the puppet." As the British Foreign Secretary said, "The League of Nations is not a supreme state and has no power to force member states to comply." Therefore, the League of Nations has no way to add sanctions to Japan's violence. Japan does not accept the advice of the League of Nations, so the mediation only declares failure. Moreover, Japan knows that the United States must currently cultivate its national power and dare not exaggerate war. Although Britain is not stable internally, it sometimes has to rely on Japan. The Soviet Union's energy is all focused on domestic construction, so how can it lightly provoke? Therefore, Japanese imperialism can rely on its military power to continue its policy of gradual encroachment, from Liaoning to Jilin and Heilongjiang to Yuguan. Now it vows to take Rehe. But what about us? Mediation has been declared a failure, and the Japanese army is gathering on the border. The "ultimatum" has arrived, and the combat is about to begin. In the future, war is unavoidable. To solve the Northeast issue and protect Rehe, it depends on how our country uses its own iron fist and how it pours out its own hot blood to reclaim the land and wash away the humiliation.</p>

<p>(New York) The New York Times reported that the British Chargé d'Affaires in Washington discussed the report of the League of Nations' Nineteen-Nation Committee with the Secretary of State today. The nature of their talk has not been revealed. The New York Times also published an editorial today, stating that the report of the Nineteen-Nation Committee is "judged by morality." Since the League of Nations does not want to use any method to forcibly apply this judgment to Japan, the newspaper means that this report has widened the door to mediation. (Reuter, 18th)</p>

<p>(New York) The Director of the U.S. Naval Aviation Bureau, Moffett, said in a speech at the graduation reunion of the U.S. Naval Academy tonight that a weak navy is enough to invite war. Now that Japan has created a "Manchukuo," that country is not restricted by naval treaties, and Japan can use its name to build as many ships as possible. Therefore, Japan's shipbuilding will actually not be subject to any restrictions. In the United States, all warships are old and many cannot be incorporated into the fleet. It is urgent to catch up and add new ships, and we should not allow our strength to decline day by day. (National Telegram, 17th)</p>

<p>(London) British Conservative Member of Parliament Churchill gave a speech at the annual meeting of the Anti-Socialist and Anti-Communist League here tonight, expressing that the United States' position on the Manchurian case will make Britain take a firmer attitude towards Japan. However, Churchill bluntly stated that the United States should not advise Britain to fight with Japan, because the United States has bound Britain's navy with unreasonable treaties and should not advise the British to fight with Japan again. He also believes that the League of Nations should not fight with Japan either, because Europe has a lot of work to be done by the League of Nations. As for the Far East, it is too far away from its sphere of influence, etc. Although Churchill's words have a pro-Japanese color, they can also represent a part of the British opinion.

<h3 id="e13">British Newspapers Review the Report <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>(London) The Times editorial today pointed out that the report of the Nineteen-Nation Committee is mild, fair, and well-considered, and said that if any party creates a new situation with violent behavior, the League of Nations Executive Council may have to reconsider the entire status in the future. The report suggests a broad autonomy, which clearly intends to reserve more rights for Japan than it enjoyed in its original state. This report will of course be passed by the League of Nations General Assembly. After the passage of this case, member states of the League of Nations will not take any action that would hinder or delay the implementation of its proposals, and will continue not to recognize the current state of Manchuria legally or in fact. Although the countries concerned do not have to be bound by any special policies at all times, all countries must take the League of Nations report as a starting point and carry out the same policies. Any changes must be made with unanimous consent. (Reuter, 18th)</p>
<p>(London) The famous weekly The Spectator's editorial today said that the League of Nations resolution will definitely be approved by the United States, and the Soviet Union may also support it. If so, its impact will be that no government in the world can recognize "Manchukuo," and no financial market can underwrite "Manchukuo" bonds. At the same time, the possibility that Japanese public and private financial resources can lend to "Manchukuo" is very slim. From this, it can also be seen that the League of Nations has not discussed active sanctions, but only adopted the value of this tool. At the same time, the League of Nations obviously cannot consider that it has fulfilled its responsibility by passing the resolution of the Nineteen-Nation Committee, and then wash its hands of the matter. In the future, there are still two major goals to be achieved: (1) In accordance with the agreement between China, Japan, and the League of Nations, an administrative agency should be established in Manchuria without borrowing the assistance of Japanese troops; (2) Restore the normal friendly relations between Japan and the League of Nations. The newspaper also said that Japan may temporarily withdraw from the League of Nations, and its troops may be all over Manchuria and Rehe, but there are things that cannot be avoided. Japan will eventually not get its wish. At present, it is hoped that all countries will unanimously prohibit the export of military supplies to Japan. (Reuter, 17th)</p>

As a result of the discussion, the opinions were consistent as follows: (1) On the day or the next day after the end of the General Assembly, order the Japanese delegation to return home from Geneva and issue a critical statement to the League of Nations at the same time; (1) When the recommendation attached to the report becomes effective, absolutely reject it and issue a counter-notification criticizing the League of Nations; (1) After the three representatives return home, listen to their report and then discuss it again, and then hold a meeting of senior statesmen to take the procedures of consulting the Privy Council, and then issue a withdrawal statement, which is expected to be in mid-March.

<p>Japan Will Launch a Coup After the Closing of Parliament</p>
<h3 id="e16">Various Aspects of Agitation Are Unusually Fierce, the Seiyukai May Regain Power <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Seiyukai President Suzuki visited Prime Minister Saito on the 13th to hear about the League of Nations situation and the progress of the meeting. At that time, Prime Minister Saito told Suzuki of the seriousness of the internal and external situation and expressed his sincerity, earnestly requesting assistance from the cabinet. Finance Minister Takahashi intends to resign on March 6 when the next year's budget is established, but because I have a heavy responsibility before the closing of Parliament, I intend to have the current Interior Minister Yamamoto Tatsuo succeed as Finance Minister, but whether the Interior Minister's position can be succeeded by you. Because the matter is of great importance, Suzuki could not answer immediately and agreed to consider this issue temporarily and answer it later. Prime Minister Saito will resign after the completion of Parliament, which is already clear. If Suzuki maintains the current cabinet, then the successor to the prime minister on the day of Saito's resignation must be Suzuki. Because the Seiyukai cabinet will be realized again, it is also unknown. (Nichiren Telegram, 18th)</p>
<p>Tokyo News: Since the House of Representatives completed the deliberation of the budget案, there are no very important issues in the House of Representatives in the future, and the House of Peers is not expected to have special disturbances. However, the trend of the political situation after the closing of Parliament is not the same for all parties, and the agitation is extremely fierce. After the meeting between Finance Minister Takahashi and Seiyukai President Suzuki at the end of last year and the meeting between Prime Minister Saito and Seiyukai President Suzuki before the end of the parliamentary recess, some people believed that a coup was certain, and that the successor cabinet would be the Suzuki cabinet. There is no doubt (Seiyukai). There are also denials that a coup will be launched based on the meetings of Saito and Suzuki, and there are those who are running around for the extension of the Saito cabinet or its reorganization movement (Minseito). There are also those who believe that the reappearance of a party cabinet is not the time, and they are eager for the reappearance of a unified cabinet, and are enthusiastic about supporting the Shougaiki Cabinet and the Hiranuma Cabinet, etc. (Simin Tongmeng), or seeking the establishment of a political and civilian coalition cabinet. In the meantime, some of the House of Peers (advocating a strong cabinet) and the bureaucracy, as well as a faction surrounding the Satsuma elders and senior statesmen, also continued various movements separately. The Japanese political situation suddenly became tense. In the future, the development of the political situation will not only depend on how Finance Minister Takahashi advances and retreats after the closing of Parliament, which will cause major changes, but also how the situation of the League of Nations will affect it.

<p>(Changchun) The General Headquarters of the Manchukuo Army for the Suppression of Rehe today issued the following statement regarding the campaign to suppress Rehe: "Pacifying Rehe was originally purely a domestic issue, merely exercising the right to rule to suppress rebellious elements within the territory. Difficulties arose after the formal troops of Zhang Xueliang invaded. Now, the right of national self-defense is being exercised, merely passively expelling the invading army from the territory. Manchukuo will proceed to overthrow a regime like that of Zhang Xueliang to preserve the nation. If its formal troops advance to invade its territory, then we will also advance to strike at the Beiping-Tianjin area. However, we will keep the troops within the national border in order to recover the national territory and to show our sincerity in preventing the spread of turmoil to within the customs and to avoid the unlimited expansion of the situation. However, if our army must cross the national border, the responsibility for the subsequent situation will lie not with us but with the enemy. According to reports, defections from the Rehe army who oppose Tang Yulin and are terrorized by the Japanese and Manchukuo armies continue to occur. However, these cannot be immediately regarded as Manchukuo troops, and whether these troops will return within the customs is unknown to Manchukuo. It can be mistaken as an invasion of Beiping and Tianjin by Manchukuo troops, and it could create a false impression. Zhang Jinghui, the current Minister of Military and Political Affairs of Manchukuo, is the commander-in-chief, and Zhang Haipeng is the front-line commander-in-chief, jointly fighting with the Japanese army, hoping to protect the national territory and the existence of Manchukuo."

<p>(Nanjing) Li Liejun arrived in Nanjing on the 18th in response to a central government summons, accompanied by his secretary Zhang Migong and over ten others. Li had advocated inviting Feng Yuxiang and southwestern generals to come to Nanjing together to discuss national defense and unite against external aggression. Therefore, he telegraphed Feng and the southwestern generals in his private capacity ten days ago. The results have been satisfactory. He is staying at Bai Wenwei's villa near the lake. Li stated that after the Second Plenary Session, he had been recuperating from illness in Mount Tai and Mount Lu, and had not been in Nanjing for a long time, thus being unable to participate in national affairs and fulfill his responsibilities. However, he has always advocated for internal stability and resisting external aggression. Some of his ideas have been published, while others have not. If the opportunity arises, he deeply desires to present them to the central government and promote them together with the people of the country. This time, the central government organized the National Defense Committee and summoned him to Nanjing to discuss important matters together. The country is in danger and the people are suffering so he could not decline on the grounds of illness. However, he also dares not be perfunctory in his conduct. In short, the most important thing today is national unity to urgently resist Japan in order to blunt their edge, and the reform of internal affairs and the alliance of all wise men cannot be delayed even for a moment. If asked about the key points, it would be to treat compatriots equally and to govern the country with impartiality and sincerity. Perhaps it is close to that. (18th dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e35">A Diplomatic Official Talks About the Past and Future of Sino-Japanese Relations <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>Diplomacy Gains Military Assistance and Wins a Moral Victory</p>
<p>Military Preparations Have Been Made for Rehe and Ultimate Victory Still Belongs to Us</p>
<p>(Nanjing) A diplomatic official talked with reporters on the 18th about the past and future of Sino-Japanese relations. Here is a summary: 1) During the dangerous period two or three months ago, the Anglo-American debt disputes were difficult to resolve, and the Nine-Power Treaty, the Washington Conference, etc., were all chaired by the United States. The League of Nations failed, and the United States found it difficult to stand idly by. Therefore, the British Foreign Secretary deliberately adopted a pro-Japanese stance to threaten the United States. It explicitly stated that Russia and the United States would not be invited to the conference, and it did not clearly oppose the puppet organization. The new compromise proposal by Drummond was also the same. If it were accepted by the League of Nations, then future diplomacy would be in a dead end. 2) The situation has changed, and there are several reasons for this. China's diplomacy has gained military assistance, and its attitude has remained firm. Since Ramsbotham came to China, he has repeatedly made serious recommendations to the government. The Anglo-American debt disputes have also gradually turned around, and the smaller countries have consistently upheld justice. Therefore, the chaotic situation has suddenly shown signs of improvement. 3) The content of the report is generally satisfactory to me, because the report clearly identifies the responsibility for the September 18th Incident. We have won a moral victory, and the deadline for the Japanese military to withdraw and the invitation for the United States and Russia to participate in the negotiations pose a major threat and sanction to Japan. The negotiation meeting is scheduled for March, and it can be implemented without the consent of the parties involved, so that Japan has no chance to create difficulties. 4) The territory that we have lost will still be recovered by us, which is a bright path. 5) The establishment of an autonomous government in the Eastern Provinces and the explicit statement that sovereignty belongs to all countries is also not regrettable. If people of talent govern, the Northeast can surely be made a bright paradise. 6) Japan's opposition to the report is not worth fearing, and there is no need to fear its withdrawal from the League of Nations. After Japan withdraws, the League of Nations will inevitably recover its territories in the South Pacific, and the League of Nations can impose sanctions at will. Japan must still fulfill its international and treaty obligations within two years. 7) The League of Nations has warned Japan about the Rehe issue. In the battles of Shanghai and Shanhaiguan, we thoroughly resisted. This time, the Japanese military's invasion of Rehe is not as calm and composed as it was before. After the Japanese military announced the invasion of Rehe, Osaka and Tokyo securities plummeted, and trading may be suspended, which shows their panic. Moreover, our military has made preparations. Although the strength is very different, it is not worth fearing. Fortunately, we will win, which will make the Japanese army completely collapse and unable to fight. It is better to have a glorious failure than not to win. We can also find another way out, so there is no need to be intimidated by the Japanese military's appearance and dazzled by their momentum. We sacrificed 10,000 people and published it in the newspapers, which made the people of the country excited. Japan died thousands of people and lied about hundreds, which has already made the Japanese panicked and lost their way. We have persisted in diplomacy for 17 months and have achieved considerable results. If we can persist in the military for three to six months, then the final victory will surely belong to us.

<h3 id="e37">Anti-Opium Association Plans to Strictly Prohibit Drugs <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Anti-Opium Association believes that the addiction to narcotic drugs is much easier than that of opium. In recent years, the popularity of drugs has exceeded the Yellow River and spread to the north and south of the Yangtze River. After investigating the situation in various places, people taking drugs such as red pills, golden pills, and white powder, and injecting morphine, in places such as Jincheng, Gaoping, Changzi, Changzhi, Mincheng, Qin County, Xiangyuan, Pingding, Shouyang, Yuci, Taigu, Qi County, Yangqu, and Taiyuan in Shanxi Province, Zhoucun, Weixian, Qingzhou, and Qingdao in Shandong Province, as well as southern Hebei, northern Henan, southern Anhui, Yixing and Wujin in Jiangsu, Jin, Qu, and Yan in Zhejiang, and Xiamen, Jinjiang, and Tong'an in Fujian, are the most prevalent areas. If it is not strictly prohibited, in a few years, it will be as widespread as opium throughout the country. Smoking opium can still prolong life, but those who take drugs will die in less than three to five years. For the sake of preserving the nation, only the local party and government organs can jointly take responsibility, urgently prevent it based on the actual situation, and prevent Chinese and foreign traitors from manufacturing and selling drugs in order to contain the source. Constantly warn the people anytime, anywhere not to take various drugs and inject morphine, and strive to make it known to every household. Those who violate the law, whether they manufacture, transport, or take drugs, will be severely punished according to the law once they are caught, and no leniency will be given. Four measures have been formulated for strict prohibition: 1) The local party and government organs shall formulate plans to prevent the spread of narcotic drugs based on the actual situation, submit them to the Director of the Civil Affairs Department, and strictly implement the aforementioned plans. The aforementioned plans shall be based on the principle of not conflicting with various laws and regulations, and special attention shall be paid to the manufacturing organs of drugs in order to eliminate the source of drugs. 2) The local party and government organs shall regularly make efforts to publicize the harm of drugs and the ban, and strictly make the people aware of the warning.

<p>Deterioration of Franco-Italian Relations</p>
<h3 id="e76">Italy Ships Large Quantities of Military Supplies through Austria and Hungary. France Submits Strong Note to Austria. <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>Reuters, Rome, 17th – A batch of military equipment was recently transported from Italy through Austria for repairs. France, suspecting this was a secret supply to the Austrian Fascist Party, immediately submitted a strong note to the Austrian government. Britain has also joined in. According to a Paris correspondent for an Italian newspaper, the French note demands that the Austrian government return the military equipment to Italy or destroy it, and make a pledge regarding this matter to the British and French representatives. The Italians are very indignant about this, and there is fear that a conflict will arise between France and Italy because of this.</p>
<p>Havas, Paris, 18th – According to a report in an Italian newspaper, France seems to have sent a note to Austria regarding the smuggling of military equipment in Central Europe. The content of the note is no different from a true ultimatum. The Paris Morning Post reported that the Foreign Ministry believes the news reported by the Italian newspaper refers to the note sent to Austria jointly by France and Britain, and that it does not have the nature of an ultimatum.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 18th – According to reliable sources, the French note to Austria is not an ultimatum, but presents a completely friendly nature. The British and French governments recently made friendly suggestions to Austria to resolve this matter. If negotiations fail, the matter will be handed over to the Council of the League of Nations for handling.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Paris, 17th – Fearing that the situation in the Balkans will cause another European war, France today sent an ultimatum-style note to Austria, demanding that Austria return to Italy within two weeks the large amount of military equipment that was transported from Italy through Austria to Hungary. It is said that the amount of military equipment is enough to supply a large army corps. According to the note's demands, the military equipment should be returned to the original sender, or it should be destroyed immediately. There are many other requirements, such as: (1) The Austrian government should provide France with guarantees proving that the military equipment has been destroyed or returned; (2) The Austrian government should thoroughly investigate whether any military equipment has leaked into Hungary through Austrian territory in the past; (3) Austria should complete the thorough investigation within two weeks and give France a guarantee. Since France issued this note, governments in various European countries have felt that the situation is quite serious. This fact is related to the recent Little Entente. Hungary, fearing oppression from the alliance of Romania, Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia, has had to take precautions against military aggression by neighboring countries. This may be the reason why Hungary purchased military equipment. Therefore, Romania and the other two members of the Little Entente strongly support France's issuance of this note. According to reports, France's move is the result of a month of detailed investigation and conflicting statements issued by Vienna. The Austrian government sent a reply to France, acknowledging that the military equipment was transported to the Hirtenberg factory, but said that it originally belonged to Austria and was now being transported for repairs. The Austrian government allowed it to be transported in because it could provide work for Austrian workers. An earlier Austrian reply acknowledged that the military equipment was transported to Hirtenberg, but said it was only in transit and was legal. France, however, considered the amount too large and refused to let the matter drop. According to the French Foreign Ministry, local officials in Hirtenberg declared that there were a total of 50,000 rifles and 200 machine guns. In addition, there were likely some airplanes, because they had seen airplanes fly over Austria into Hungary and had not returned. Later, the French government, due to the contradictory statements of the Austrian government and the alarmist remarks in socialist newspapers, became more determined to investigate the matter thoroughly. The socialists believe that it is better for these military supplies to fall into the hands of the Hungarians than other Balkan countries, because if Italy and Yugoslavia were to fall out, Hungary would be Yugoslavia's strongest neighbor.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Rome, 17th – At a time when the friendship between France and Italy is deteriorating, there is now a French protest regarding the Italian military equipment being transported from Austria to Hungary, and thus the international situation is becoming more serious. This French protest has been submitted to the Vienna government by the French ambassador. According to the Italian Popolo newspaper, this document is "the most vile article rarely seen in international relations." The Popolo also briefly described the process of the military equipment transportation case, saying that this is just a private transaction, and the so-called military equipment is just some old-fashioned rifles, which were seized from Austria by Italy during the European war. Now, because they are old, they are being sent back to the original manufacturer in Hirtenberg for repairs and modifications, so they can be resold. The Popolo further stated that the French protest letter took the form of an ultimatum and was a major insult to the independent state of Austria, because it completely disregarded international etiquette, and it is foreseeable that it will inevitably arouse resentment in other countries towards France, and condemn them as disruptors of peace.</p>
<p>Disarmament Conference French and German Delegates Engage in Heated Debate</p>
<h3 id="e77">Russian Representative Demands Amendment to British Proposal <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>Reuters, Geneva, 17th – Today, during the Disarmament Conference's discussion of France's proposal to set standards for the armies of European and other continental countries, shorten military service periods, and reduce the size of standing armies, the German and French representatives engaged in a heated debate on the conference floor. The French representative, Paul-Boncour, declared that the nature of the military equipment of certain countries, although legal, is quite capable of arousing militaristic ideas. The German representative, Nadolny, said that setting army standards is not a necessary condition for reducing armaments, and said that the current demands on Germany to reorganize its army must be considered carefully. Nadolny also refused to accept any blame from all parties regarding Germany.</p>
<p>TASS, Geneva, 17th – Today, at a meeting of the Political Committee of the Disarmament Conference, the Soviet Union's chief representative, Litvinov, proposed two amendments to the British disarmament proposal made a few days ago. According to the original British proposal, European countries would individually issue a declaration formally announcing the abolition of the use of any force to resolve international disputes. At the same time, all countries would issue a general declaration of disarmament agreement. At the time, Litvinov pointed out that the nature of the declaration proposed by Britain would only bind non-European countries to the Kellogg-Briand Pact, while European countries would be restricted from using force under any circumstances. Today, Litvinov proposed an amendment to remove the words limiting the declaration to European countries, making it universal. However, the declaration should simultaneously have a general declaration of disarmament agreement, and that declaration should also not be limited to temporary application. Litvinov explained his proposal by saying that the international announcement of the abolition of the use of all force and coercive acts should be stated in writing and jointly signed by all countries that have joined the Kellogg-Briand Pact, making it a formal international law. However, the Soviet Union's representative cannot agree to make different interpretations of aggression between European and non-European countries. If European countries are exceptionally guaranteed by this declaration, then non-European countries will suffer losses. In addition to the danger of being attacked by countries on the same continent, European countries are also likely to be attacked by countries on other continents. Finally, Litvinov stated that the British proposal to abolish the use of all force should be signed before the disarmament agreement is established. If it is believed that this declaration should be issued at the same time as the disarmament agreement, then it is unknown when that time will come, or that time may not come at all. Moreover, the governments of most countries are currently very short-lived. When the opportunity comes and various countries are ready to sign, a new government of one of the countries may appear and refuse to sign the declaration, which could overturn the established situation.</p>

<p>Reuters, Geneva, 18th – At a tense time when the League of Nations is dealing with the Sino-Japanese dispute according to Article 11 of the Covenant, the South American republic of Colombia has now also requested the League of Nations to invoke Article 15 of the Covenant. This action is the result of correspondence between the League of Nations and the parties involved. On February 16th, Peru sent a note to the League of Nations, referring to the situation in Tarapacá, saying that Peruvian troops are now defending their position to resist Colombian incursions. Last night, the chairman of the League of Nations Council Committee, Lester (representative of Southern Ireland), replied in a concise document, saying that Tarapacá is Colombian territory, and the committee does not understand why there is a Peruvian military position there, and asked for an explanation of this point as soon as possible. This morning, Colombia sent a long document to the League of Nations, requesting the rapid application of Article 15 of the Covenant. The Council has scheduled a special meeting on February 20th to deal with this matter.</p>

<p>Another Statement by the Chinese Representative to Japan (II)</p>
<h3 id="e81">The Spirit of the Treaty of Portsmouth <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese government's views on the economic severance of relations with Japan have been explained in detail in the speech of the Chinese representative to the Council and in the memorandum submitted by the Chinese representative to the League of Nations, so there is no need to repeat them here. However, if the economic severance of relations is, as the Japanese representative claimed, a disguised form of war, then how should the Japanese army's invasion of Manchuria, accompanied by artillery, airplanes, machine gun teams, and all other weapons, to kill Chinese people and damage Chinese property, be described? In short, the initial cause of China's current economic severance of relations with Japan was the massacre of Chinese people in the Korean region in July 1931, with the tacit approval of the Japanese police authorities. As a result, 142 Chinese people died, 546 were injured, 91 were missing, and property losses exceeded hundreds of thousands of Japanese yen. After the September 18th Incident occurred and the Japanese army invaded Manchuria, this economic severance movement became even more active. Every past economic severance movement against Japan has been a means of resistance against Japanese military aggression or provocation, out of extreme helplessness. This is an obvious fact. In the past 30 years, there have been nine economic severances against Japan. However, the Japanese representative only pointed out four times, believing that they could not be regarded as actions to resist Japanese military actions. This is tantamount to tacitly admitting that the other five times can indeed be regarded as actions to resist Japanese military aggression. If we examine the four times pointed out by the Japanese side one by one, the economic severance in 1908 was the result of Japan issuing an ultimatum after the Erh-Chen-Wan incident in order to satisfy its arbitrary demands. The economic severance in 1909 was the result of Japan making similar provocative demands during the Sino-Japanese negotiations on the reconstruction of the Andong-Poyang Railway. The economic severance in 1919 was the result of the Japanese refusing to withdraw their troops from eastern China under the pretext of eliminating German influence, which aroused natural resistance from the Chinese people. The economic severance in 1923 was an expression of the Chinese people's resistance to the Japanese government's insistence on implementing the 1915 agreement based on the so-called Twenty-One Demands.</p>
<p>The Japanese representative cited many of the British government's notes to the Soviet representative regarding the so-called Zinoviev letter incident, but in fact, it has nothing to do with the issue of economic severance. The organization of the Chinese National Government and the Moscow Soviet Government are completely different. Moreover, considering the nature and extent of the Japanese army's aggressive actions in Manchuria and even Shanghai, Tianjin, and other places, the adoption and maintenance of an economic severance movement by the Chinese people or groups as a legitimate act of self-defense is fully justified.</p>
<p>In the Japanese representative's statement, he mentioned the Shanghai Incident from January to March 1932. Regarding this matter, the Chinese representative has submitted several documents to the Lytton Commission for reference. These documents clearly stated that on the evening of January 28, Japanese armed forces, assisted by machine guns, first attacked Chinese police and then attacked Chinese troops. However, the Chinese police and troops took a strict defensive posture. Therefore, the Japanese claim that Japanese troops were fired upon is inconsistent with the facts.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the method of dividing the defense of the Shanghai International Settlement was jointly agreed upon by the military authorities of various countries. The Chinese authorities did not participate, were not notified, and had no reason to be bound by it. Moreover, the method drafted by the commanders of the various countries' land and naval forces did not allow the Japanese army to invade Chinese areas outside the International Settlement or attack Chinese troops stationed near it.</p>
<p>According to authoritative reports from neutral parties such as the Consular Committee appointed by the League of Nations, the Shanghai Incident was entirely due to Japan's premeditated plan, the purpose of which was to intimidate the Chinese people and reduce their spirit of resistance to the situation in Manchuria. The result of the Shanghai Incident was the death of more than 24,000 Chinese people, property damage of 150 million yuan, and the suffering of Shanghai residents was incalculable.</p>
<p>Even more strangely, the Japanese representative asked the Council to pay attention to the greater loss of life of the Chinese people caused by the Chinese army when the Japanese army attacked Shanghai and caused the loss of Chinese lives. This is the most obvious example of the peculiar psychology of the Japanese government. These two things are absolutely unrelated. It is incomprehensible why the Japanese representative confuses these two things. Does Japan mean that the internal strife that is unavoidable during China's period of great political transition, much of which was instigated by Japan, can be a reason for the Japanese army to use force to invade Chinese territory and cause more pain to the Chinese people? This kind of attitude is obviously contrary to the righteousness and conscience of all mankind.</p>

<p>Zhu and Mao's Bandit Troops Attack Nanfeng Again and Collapse</p>
<h3 id="e82">Mao Bingwen Fights Bloodily for Four Days and Nights, Piles of Bandit Corpses Like Mountains <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence, Zhu and Mao's pseudo-First Army Corps Lin Biao, pseudo-Third Army Corps Peng Dehuai, pseudo-Fifth Army Corps Dong Zhentang, pseudo-Twenty-Second Army Luo Binghui, and the recently joined Fang Shao pseudo-Tenth Army from Guixi and Peng's bandits, after withdrawing from Jinxi and Guixi, invaded the northwest of Fujian Province through Zixi and Lichuan. The pseudo-army hospitals, wounded bandits, and various rear pseudo-agencies moved to the Jianning and Ninghua areas. However, the bandits' whereabouts are elusive and unpredictable. According to investigations, at the beginning of this month, the bandits in the Zixi, Guangze, and Jianning areas traveled at night and hid during the day, and gathered again in Lichuan County. Since the 10th, Mao and Peng suddenly personally led the main forces of each unit to besiege Nanfeng in several ways. The scattered bandits lurking in various places in the Huangshidu area at the junction of Jinxi and Zixi also attacked northward at the same time to respond. According to military reports from the front line, the bandits attacked Nanfeng. (A) Peng's bandits commanded the pseudo-Third Army Corps to attack Xinfeng Street from Xiaoshi at the junction of Nancheng, Lichuan, and Guangze, hoping to cut off the connection between the national army stationed in Nancheng and Nanfeng, in order to contain the division at Taliwei and bypass the north of Nancheng. (B) Fang Shao's pseudo-Tenth Army, 82nd and 83rd Regiments, etc., attacked the east of Nanfeng from Shixia below Shangguan. (C) The pseudo-Fifth Army Corps took Zhongxian Town, Lichuan as its base and attacked the south of Nanfeng. (D) Luo Binghui led the pseudo-Twenty-Second Army to advance to Shanshi, more than ten miles away from Nanfeng City. (E) Another unit came down from Guangchang and crossed the Fenglin Ferry to the west of Nanfeng. The above units adopted a four-sided encirclement strategy and attacked the county seat fiercely. The garrison troops Mao Bingwen and others withdrew into the city and defended it desperately. The bandits repeatedly gathered their teams to charge, and Mao's troops waited until the bandits approached before bombarding them with machine guns and artillery. The bandits also fought bravely, one after another, and the sound of guns and cannons was endless from the 10th to the 14th. The bandit corpses piled up like mountains. According to military intelligence, the bandits had suffered too many casualties and exhausted their elite troops, and were now retreating in their original directions. The bandits who committed crimes in Nancheng, Yihuang, and Huangshidu also dispersed one after another, since the purpose of covering had been lost. There were no major changes in other places. However, the Guangdong and Guangxi troops have already set out to encircle and suppress the Jiangxi bandits, and will soon join forces with the Fujian army to advance towards Yudu, Huichang, and Xingguo, hoping to defeat Zhu and Mao's main forces in two months, eliminate the remaining bandits in one month, and complete the task of suppressing the bandits in three months as desired.

<p>Turmoil in the Hunan Provincial Party Committee</p>
<h3 id="e84">Tan Changkai Ordered to Return, He Jian Strongly Resigns from the Provincial Party Committee <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>Changsha Correspondence, Hunan's party affairs have always been divided into the "small organization" and "anti-small organization" factions. The small organization focuses on the lower-level party departments in various counties, while the anti-small organization relies on the power of the provincial government to operate. The infighting and secret struggles are extremely fierce. Major disturbances such as the demolition of the Changsha Municipal Party Department and the Hunan Zhongshan Daily, which was run by the Provincial Party Department, have been staged. In the past two years, although there has been superficial peace, in fact they have still failed to cooperate. Last year, the Third Provincial Congress of Hunan was held, using the Category B election method to elect double the number of executive and supervisory committee members of the Provincial Party Department. He Jian, Tan Changkai, Huang Jiasheng, Wang Qi, Zhang Jiong, Xie Zuyou, and Zhu Haohuai were presented to the Central Committee for approval as members of the Executive Committee, and Peng Guojun, Xiao Fengwei, Peng Yunbin, Meng Qingxuan, and Liu Baoshu were presented as members of the Supervisory Committee, establishing a formal Provincial Party Department. Of the seven members of the Executive Committee, Wang, Zhang, and Xie belonged to the small organization, He, Tan, and Huang belonged to the anti-small organization, and Zhu Haohuai was from Guangdong and belonged to the neutral faction. All five members of the Supervisory Committee belonged to the small organization, which shows that the real power of Hunan's party affairs is in the hands of the small organization faction. Last year, Yao Xuehuai, a key member of the small organization faction and a member of the Executive Committee of the Changsha Municipal Party Department, criticized the government's military expenditure and fled the province, causing a party-government dispute. Wang Qi and Zhang Jiong then left Hunan for Nanjing, never to return. The rift between the two factions within the Party Department has become increasingly apparent since then, but it has not yet erupted. On the 2nd of this month, the 56th Standing Committee Meeting of the Central Party Department resolved that Tan Changkai, a member of the Hunan Provincial Party Department, be transferred back, and his vacancy be filled by Xiao Jun, the first alternate member. It was discovered that Xiao was a member of the small organization faction, and He Jian and others were very dissatisfied, believing that this matter must have been done by Wang Qi and Zhang Jiong in Nanjing. The National Daily, which is run by the Provincial Government, even published an article criticizing this move by the Central Committee as illegal. At the same time, the Changsha Municipal Party Department also submitted a request to the Central Party Department to withdraw the transfer order, and telegraphed various county and municipal party departments, asking them to adopt the same position. Party departments in counties such as Yongxing, Yizhang, and Hengshan responded by sending telegrams in support. He Jian also telegraphed the Central Committee to resign from his position as a member of the Executive Committee of the Provincial Party Department, stating that he would no longer be responsible for party affairs. He also stopped attending meetings of the Provincial Party Department from the 8th of this month. The recent standing committees of the Provincial Party Department have consequently lacked a quorum and have been suspended three times, and party affairs have come to a standstill. Li Faquan, the secretary of the Provincial Party Department who was advancing and retreating with He Jian, also submitted his resignation on the 15th and did not go to the office to work. The Hunan party turmoil is already looming. (February 16th)</p>

<h3 id="e85">Part 2: Progress of the Sino-Japanese Dispute in the League of Nations <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>(1) A Brief Account of the Development of the Incident: Since the submission of this case to the League of Nations, the resolutions of the Council and the Assembly have repeatedly depended on the changes in the situation in the Far East. At the beginning of the Sino-Japanese dispute, when the Chinese government referred the case to the League of Nations under Article 11 of the Covenant, the scope of the incident only extended to Shenyang and some other locations in the three northeastern provinces. At that time, the Council repeatedly received assurances from Japan that Japan had no territorial ambitions in Manchuria and that as long as the lives and property of Japanese residents were guaranteed, Japan could withdraw its troops to within the South Manchuria Railway zone. This was the gist of the resolutions of September 30, 1932, and the draft resolution of October 24, the latter of which was agreed to by the entire Council except for Japan, allowing the Council to seek further commitment from the Japanese delegation. After the Japanese representative rejected the aforementioned draft resolution, Japan insisted that fundamental problems between China and Japan must be resolved, prompting the Council to propose further measures within the scope of ensuring the implementation of the September 30 resolution, in order to achieve a final and fundamental resolution of the problems between the two countries. On December 10, 1932, the Council accepted Japan's proposal to organize a "Commission of Inquiry" to investigate the situation on the ground and to report to the Council on "any circumstances affecting international relations that may disrupt the peace between China and Japan or the understanding on which peace is maintained." Between December and March, the situation in the Far East deteriorated significantly. Japanese troops completely occupied South Manchuria and began to invade North Manchuria. Outside Manchuria, fierce conflicts between formal Chinese and Japanese troops had begun in Shanghai and were ongoing. At the same time, in the areas occupied by Japanese troops, administrative organs were reorganized, forming an independent state called "Manchukuo," denying China's sovereignty. Subsequently, China requested the Council to handle this dispute not only under Article 11 of the Covenant but also under Articles 10 and 15. On February 19, 1932, as a result of China's request under Article 15, paragraph 9, the Council submitted the dispute to the Assembly. The report of the Commission of Inquiry was necessary for a detailed examination of the substance of the dispute. Therefore, from January onwards, before receiving the report of the Commission of Inquiry, the main tasks of the Council and later the Assembly were to do their best to cease hostilities, prevent further expansion of the situation, and maintain the rights of the parties and the principles of the Covenant, so as not to be adversely affected by any "fait accompli," and to clearly express the League's attitude towards the dispute with the resolution of March 11, declaring that member states of the League should not recognize any situation, treaty, or agreement created in violation of the Covenant or the Pact of Paris until the dispute is resolved in accordance with the Covenant. Hostilities in Shanghai ended, but in the three northeastern provinces, Japanese troops or "Manchukuo" government troops continued to fight against informal Chinese troops. In September 1932, a few days after the report of the Commission of Inquiry was signed in Peiping, the Japanese government's attitude underwent a fundamental change, namely, the Japanese government recognized the government of "Manchukuo." The report of the Commission of Inquiry could not reach Geneva before the end of September, that is, before the expiration of the six-month period, which is the deadline stipulated in the Covenant for sending the report to the Assembly in accordance with Article 15. Therefore, the Assembly, with the consent of the parties, decided on July 1 to extend the necessary deadline, but understood that this extension should not be regarded as a precedent. The Commission of Inquiry was thus able to complete its report locally, and the parties were able to submit their opinions on the report, while the Council and the Assembly were able to examine the materials thus obtained. The examination of these materials and the exchange of views with the parties continued from November 1932 to early February 1933. After discussions in the Council, the Assembly, based on the materials and conclusions contained in the report of the Commission of Inquiry, attempted to resolve the dispute through negotiations between the parties in accordance with Article 15, paragraph 3, but without effect, leading the Assembly to adopt this report in accordance with paragraph 4 of the same article.</p>
<p>(2) The Reasons for Submitting the Dispute to the League of Nations: The events that occurred in South Manchuria from September 18 to 19, 1931, and the initial discussions of the Council on China's request. The Council, due to the actions taken by the Japanese army in Manchuria on the night of September 18, 1931, because an incident occurred near Shenyang, in the South Manchuria Railway zone protected by the Japanese army, the Japanese military authorities, citing the necessity of military precautions, sent troops outside the zone, especially to Chinese cities adjacent to the zone and to the railway lines terminating in Shenyang. Chinese cities such as Shenyang, Changchun, Andong, Yingkou, and others were occupied, and Chinese troops were dispersed or disarmed. On September 21, China, in accordance with Article 11 of the Covenant, requested the Council to take immediate steps to prevent further changes in the situation that would endanger international peace, to restore the situation before the incident, and to determine the nature and amount of compensation due to the Republic of China. On September 22, the Council authorized the President of the Council (i.e., the Spanish representative Lerroux) to send an urgent request to the two governments to prevent any action that would escalate the situation or hinder the peaceful resolution of the issue, and to advise the two governments to immediately proceed with the withdrawal of their troops without endangering the lives and property of their people. On September 28, the President of the Council, based on the reports received from the two parties, explained the situation to the General Assembly, stating that "the withdrawal of Japanese troops to within the South Manchuria Railway zone is underway," and that "on September 28, the Japanese representative had declared in the Council that the withdrawal of troops was proceeding, except for Shenyang and Jilin, where only a small number of Japanese troops were stationed outside the railway zone in Xinmin and Zhengjiatun to protect Japanese residents from attacks by Chinese soldiers and bandits, as these soldiers and bandits were disturbing the aforementioned areas." The situation was such when the Council adopted the following resolution on September 30 (see page 2307 of the League of Nations Official Journal, December 1931). The resolution was as follows: (1) The Council takes note of the replies of the Chinese and Japanese governments to the urgent appeal of the President of the Council and the steps taken to respond to this appeal. (2) The Council considers the statement of the Japanese government that it has no territorial ambitions in the eastern provinces to be important. (3) The Council takes note of the statement of the Japanese representative that the Japanese army has begun to withdraw, and that the Japanese government will continue to withdraw its troops to the railway zone as quickly as possible, in proportion to the safety of the lives and property of Japanese residents being effectively guaranteed, and hopes to fully implement this intention as soon as possible. (4) The Council takes note of the statement of the Chinese representative that the Chinese government will be responsible for the safety of the lives and property of Japanese residents outside the area when the Japanese army continues to withdraw and the local Chinese officials and police are restored. (5) The Council is convinced that both governments are extremely keen to avoid taking any action that would disrupt the peace and understanding between the two countries and is aware that the Chinese and Japanese representatives have assured that their respective governments will take all necessary steps to prevent the expansion of the scope of the incident or the further aggravation of the situation. (6) The Council requests the two parties to do their utmost to restore normal relations between the two countries as soon as possible and to continue and promptly complete the implementation of the aforementioned guarantees in order to achieve this goal. (7) The Council requests the two parties to fully provide the Council with information on the development of the situation at any time. (8) The Council decides that, unless an unexpected event occurs that requires an immediate meeting, it will reconvene in Geneva on October 10 to consider the situation at that time. (9) The Council authorizes its President, after consulting with his colleagues, especially the representatives of the two countries concerned, to cancel the meeting of the Council on October 14 if he considers that, based on the information on the progress of the situation obtained from the parties concerned or from other members, there is no need to reconvene the meeting. (The Council's wishes were not realized.) On October 10, the Chinese delegation, due to the continued active offensive by the Japanese army and the bombing of Jinzhou, the seat of the temporary provincial government, by aircraft, requested the Council to convene an emergency meeting. When the Council met in September, it decided to send the minutes of the Council and documents relating to the Sino-Japanese dispute to the U.S. government. At the same time, the U.S. government also expressed its full sympathy with the League of Nations' attitude. On October 16, the Council decided to continue to cooperate with the U.S. government and invited the U.S. government to send a representative to attend the Council in order to discuss the relationship between the provisions of the Pact of Paris and the unfortunate current situation in Manchuria and to observe the situation. The U.S. government sent the same note to the Chinese and Japanese governments regarding all other discussions of the Council on the issue. On October 22, the President of the Council (the French representative Briand) submitted a draft resolution, which was unanimously agreed to except for the parties concerned. The draft resolution, after stating the commitments undertaken by the Chinese and Japanese governments in accordance with the resolution of September 30 of the previous month and the declaration of the Japanese representative that Japan had no territorial intentions in Manchuria, requested the Japanese government to immediately begin withdrawing the Japanese army to within the railway zone and to withdraw all troops by the next meeting, and requested the Chinese government to prepare measures to receive the areas from which the Japanese army withdrew to ensure the safety of the lives and property of Japanese residents. The draft resolution, for the purpose of implementation, also slightly specified the detailed measures. The draft resolution also suggested to the Chinese and Japanese governments that, after the withdrawal of the Japanese army, the two countries should immediately begin direct negotiations to resolve all outstanding issues between China and Japan, especially regarding the recent incidents and disputes arising from the situation of the Eastern Provinces Railway. To achieve the above objectives, the Council suggested that the two parties should organize a conciliation committee or a similar permanent body. Finally, it was proposed that the Council should reconvene on November 16. On December 13, the Chinese representative accepted the draft resolution as a minimum. The Japanese representative then submitted a counter-proposal, stating that the Japanese government, in view of the tension and circumstances in Manchuria, could not predict a definite date for the withdrawal of the Japanese army. The Japanese government believed that restoring a calmer state of mind was absolutely necessary and therefore decided on several principles as the basis for the regular relations between China and Japan. However, the Japanese representative had no authority to include these principles in the resolution or to discuss them in detail at the Council meeting, as these principles should only be the basic conditions for direct negotiations between the two parties. The Council believed that, as it was unaware of the content of the "principles," it could not, of course, mention them in the draft resolution. Due to the opposition of the Japanese representative, the Council was not able to pass the resolution on October 24 and adjourned the meeting to November 18. After the meeting on October 24, the Chinese representative, on behalf of the Chinese government, made the following declaration to the President of the Council: China, like other member states of the League of Nations, is bound by the Covenant and conscientiously abides by all treaty obligations. The Chinese government is determined to fulfill all obligations stipulated in the Covenant. To demonstrate this will, it is extremely willing to resolve all disputes with Japan regarding the interpretation of treaties through arbitration or judicial means in accordance with the provisions of Article 13 of the Covenant. To implement this will, the Chinese government is willing to conclude an arbitration treaty with Japan, just as the United States and China recently concluded an arbitration treaty, or as most arbitration treaties concluded between member states of the League of Nations in recent years.</p>
<p>(3) Progress of Japanese Military Action in North Manchuria: After the Council met in October, the Japanese army again engaged in attacks near the Nenjiang Bridge of the Taonan Railway in Manchuria. The Nenjiang Bridge was destroyed in October by the troops of Ma Zhanshan, the Chairman of Heilongjiang Province, to prevent the advance of Zhang Haipeng's troops. According to the Chinese side, Zhang Haipeng was taking the offensive under the command of the Japanese army. To justify the interference in the repair of the Nenjiang Bridge as reasonable, the Japanese government unilaterally declared to the Chinese government that the transfer of the Taonan Railway was based on a contract. The South Manchuria Railway Company built the line, and the Chinese side had not yet repaid the debt and was unwilling to convert the debt into a loan. Therefore, the line could be considered to belong to the South Manchuria Railway Company, which was extremely concerned about protecting the company's property and maintaining the railway's transportation. On November 2, the Japanese government declared that, at the request of the South Manchuria and Taonan Railway Bureaus, it had dispatched a team of engineers on that day, protected by infantry, artillery, and air force, to repair the railway bridge. The Japanese army immediately clashed with the Chinese army, which refused to retreat, and repelled it. In mid-November, Japanese troops then advanced to and crossed the Chinese Eastern Railway and captured Angangxi, and subsequently captured Qiqihar on November 19.</p>
<p>(4) Measures to Reorganize the Civil Administration in Manchuria: While military action was progressing in Manchuria, the reorganization of the civil administration was also taking place simultaneously. In the case of Shenyang, after the disintegration of the political situation following the September 18 Incident, the local government was initially placed under the responsibility of Japanese Colonel Doihara. Subsequently, on October 20, Zhao Xinbo, a Chinese national who graduated from Tokyo Imperial University with a doctorate in law, was appointed as the mayor. At that time, the former Liaoning Provincial Government had moved to Jinzhou, and another Liaoning Provincial Government was organized to counter it. The Local Maintenance Committee, organized on September 24, was reorganized into the Liaoning Provincial Autonomous Public Office in October. On November 7, the Autonomous Public Office was reorganized into the Acting Liaoning Provincial Government, declaring its separation from the former Northeast Government and the Nanjing National Government. At the same time, a Supreme Guidance Department was established, part of whose functions were to guide and supervise the provincial government and encourage local autonomy. All these new organs, as well as the banks issuing banknotes, were assigned Japanese advisors, most of whom were influential officials of the South Manchuria Railway. The Chinese representative insisted that the establishment and maintenance of all new organs in Shenyang, Jilin, and other locations occupied by the Japanese army should be the responsibility of the Japanese army, as these organs were all puppets and products of the Japanese army. The Japanese representative replied that the Japanese authorities had no other way but to encourage the Chinese to organize their own groups to maintain order. If these groups could fulfill their responsibilities, it would make it easier to realize the wishes repeatedly and formally expressed by the Japanese government to withdraw troops as soon as possible. Moreover, in November 1931, the Chinese delegation submitted to the Council successive reports from Dr. Frederick A. Cleveland, the Associate Director of the Salt Inspectorate. According to these reports, the Japanese military authorities were at that time forcibly seizing salt taxes throughout Manchuria, while according to Japanese official documents, the Japanese military authorities were transferring the surplus funds from the Chinese salt tax organs to another Chinese organ (the Local Maintenance Committee), which could not be said to be improper.</p>
<p>(5) Council Meetings and the Organization of the Commission of Inquiry in November and December 1931: At this time, the Council was meeting in Paris on November 16. On November 21, the Japanese side proposed sending a Commission of Inquiry to the Far East to investigate, stating that "the Japanese government's sincere desire to withdraw troops to the South Manchuria Railway zone as soon as possible in accordance with the resolution of September 30 will not be changed by the establishment and dispatch of this Commission of Inquiry." After consideration, the Council adopted the following resolution on December 10:</p>
<p>(1) The Council reaffirms the resolution unanimously adopted on September 30, which both China and Japan have declared themselves solemnly bound by. Therefore, the Council requests the Chinese and Japanese governments to take the necessary steps to implement this resolution, so that the Japanese army may withdraw to the railway zone as soon as possible in accordance with the conditions set forth in the resolution. (2) The Council believes that the situation has become more serious since the meeting on November 24 and is aware that both parties have undertaken to take the necessary measures to prevent further escalation of the situation and to avoid any action that would lead to war and loss of life again. (3) The Council requests both parties to continue to notify the Council of the development of the situation at any time. (4) The Council requests other member states to provide the Council with information obtained locally by their representatives at any time. (5) In view of the special circumstances of this case, and desiring to assist the two governments in seeking a final and fundamental resolution of the various issues between the two governments, the Council, without prejudice to the implementation of the above-mentioned measures, decides to send a commission, composed of five members, to study on the spot any circumstances affecting international relations that may disrupt the peace between China and Japan or the understanding on which peace is maintained, and to report to the Council. The Chinese and Japanese governments may each send a member to assist the commission. The two governments should provide the commission with all facilities so that the commission may have access to any information it needs. If the two parties begin any negotiations, such negotiations are not within the scope of the commission's duties, and the commission has no right to interfere in any party's military measures. The appointment of the commission and its consideration shall not in any way hinder the Japanese government's guarantee in the resolution of September 30 for the withdrawal of the Japanese army to the railway zone. (6) Between now and the next regular meeting on January 25, the Council will continue to deal with this issue and requests the President to pay attention to this issue and to reconvene a meeting if necessary. (The President of the Council, the French representative Briand, when submitting this resolution, solemnly declared that the Council attaches extreme importance to the resolution of September 30 and its own belief that the two governments will fully fulfill the commitments of the resolution, and that it is necessary and urgent for both parties to avoid any action that would further lead to war or escalate the situation. The U.S. government expressed its pleasure at the passage of the resolution, as there had been definite progress.)</p>
<p>(6) Japanese Army Attacks Jinzhou: The Destruction of the Remaining Chinese Administrative Authority in the South Manchuria Area. When the Council was engaged in drafting the above-mentioned resolution, both China and Japan requested the Council to pay attention to the danger of military action extending to southwestern Manchuria. Consequently, there was an effort to establish a neutral zone between the Japanese army and Zhang Xueliang's troops in Jinzhou. However, this effort unfortunately failed. When the Japanese representative accepted Section 2 of the resolution, he stated that it should be understood that the purpose of the section was not to prevent the Japanese army from taking actions necessary to directly protect the lives and property of Japanese residents from the trampling of bandits or unlawful elements in various parts of Manchuria. This action was an exceptional measure based on the special circumstances in the Northeast. Once the normal state of affairs was restored in the area in the future, the necessity of this measure would naturally disappear. On December 23, the Japanese army began to advance towards Jinzhou and occupied it on January 3, 1932. The Japanese army then advanced to the Great Wall and made contact with the Japanese army stationed at Shanhaiguan, south of the Great Wall. The result of this military action was the complete destruction of the Chinese administrative authority in the South Manchuria area.</p>
<p>(7) Hostilities in Shanghai: The Origin of Hostilities. After January 1932, the situation in areas outside Manchuria became increasingly precarious, as was the case in Shanghai. Regarding the Shanghai Incident, the Consular Corps Committee, which was organized in Shanghai in early February, collected a total of four reports describing the course of the incident from the beginning to March 5. The subsequent events are recorded in the report of the Commission of Inquiry. The Commission of Inquiry, as explained above, was established in January 1932 and arrived in Shanghai on March 14. Prior to this, there had been serious anti-Chinese riots in Korea. As stated in the report of the Commission of Inquiry, these riots triggered the boycott of Japanese goods in Shanghai and other ports in China after June 1931. The Japanese army's occupation of Manchuria intensified the boycott. In some cases, the Chinese government and official organizations actively assisted, causing significant losses to Japanese businesses. The tense feelings between the people of the two countries became increasingly acute, and serious incidents soon occurred. As a result, Japanese residents in Shanghai requested their government to send troops and warships to stop the anti-Japanese movement. Subsequently, the Japanese Consul-General presented five conditions to the Mayor of Shanghai, China. On January 21, the Mayor of Shanghai stated that it was difficult to comply with two of the conditions (i.e., fully suppressing the anti-Japanese movement and dissolving all anti-Japanese organizations that provoked ill feelings and incited anti-Japanese riots). On the same day, the Japanese naval commander announced that if the Chinese Mayor's reply was unsatisfactory, he would take necessary steps to protect Japanese rights and interests. On January 24, additional Japanese naval troops arrived in Shanghai. Rumors spread that Chinese troops stationed in Zhabei District, in the Chinese-controlled area, were also increasing their numbers. On January 27, the Japanese Consul-General demanded that the Chinese side provide a satisfactory reply to the conditions by 6:00 a.m. the next morning. The Mayor of Shanghai expressed his intention to the representatives of various countries to make as many concessions as possible to avoid conflict. On the evening of January 27 to 28, the Anti-Japanese Association was suspended, and other anti-Japanese organizations were closed down by the Chinese police. On the morning of January 28, the Japanese naval commander notified the commanders of the armed forces of various countries that if the Chinese side did not provide a satisfactory reply, he would take action the next morning. The Shanghai Municipal Council held a meeting and decided to declare martial law from 4:00 p.m. that afternoon. At 4:00 p.m., the Japanese Consul-General notified the Consular Corps that he had received a Chinese reply accepting all Japanese conditions, which could be considered completely satisfactory, and that no action would be taken for the time being. At the same time, the Defense Committee of the Public Concession, in order to adapt to the emergency situation at the time, divided the Concession into areas and assigned the armed forces of various countries to be responsible for defense. The Japanese defense zone designated by the Defense Committee not only included a part of the Concession but also extended beyond the Concession, westward to the Songhu Railway. The Japanese naval headquarters was located at the northernmost end of this extended area. The Beisichuan Road and Diswell Road, which belonged to the Municipal Council, usually had Japanese naval marines stationed there. At 11:00 p.m., the Japanese naval commander declared that, in view of the current emergency situation, the Imperial Navy was extremely concerned about the situation in Zhabei, where a large number of Japanese residents lived, and had decided to send troops to the area, hoping that the Chinese troops stationed in Zhabei would quickly withdraw to the west of the railway. An hour later, Japanese marines and armed civilians advanced towards the railway. The last team attempted to enter the station through the gate of Henan Road, which entered the Concession and the defense zone, but was stopped by the Shanghai Volunteer Corps stationed in the area. The Shanghai Volunteer Corps had strict orders, the principle of which was that the duty of the defending troops was limited to defense and not to attack. According to the defense plan, the Japanese troops sent to the Zhabei section came into contact with the Chinese troops. According to the first report of the Consular Corps Committee, the Chinese troops, even if they were willing to withdraw, were prevented from doing so by time.</p>
<p>(8) Hostilities in Shanghai: Council Discussions Based on Article 10 of the Covenant; First Discussion of the Assembly Based on Article 15; The End of Hostilities in Shanghai. The Shanghai War thus began. The Council, which was meeting in Geneva at the time, and the countries with special interests in Shanghai, repeatedly worked to stop it. After the above-mentioned serious incident occurred, China requested on January 29 that the dispute be handled in accordance with Articles 10 and 15. On February 16, the member states of the Council, except for China and Japan, presented an urgent request to the Japanese government to pay attention to Article 10 of the Covenant. According to the meaning of the article, "Any disregard of the provisions of the article, damage to the territorial integrity of a member state of the League of Nations, and alteration of its political independence shall not be recognized as valid by the member states of the League." On February 19, the Council, at the request of China, submitted the dispute to the Assembly. The Assembly convened a meeting on March 3. Before the Assembly met, the Council made a final effort to stop the war and proposed on February 29 to organize a round-table conference in Shanghai, but its holding would have to wait until measures to stop the hostilities had been agreed upon locally. The Council's proposal was not implemented because the war continued. On March 3, after hearing the statements of the representatives of both sides, the Assembly passed the following resolution on March 4: "The Assembly, in restating the proposal decided by the Council on February 29, and declaring that it does not prejudice other principal methods contained in the proposal, (1) requests the Chinese and Japanese governments to immediately take the necessary measures to make the cease-fire orders issued by the military authorities of both sides effective; (2) requests the major powers with special interests in Shanghai to report to the Assembly on the state of implementation of the aforementioned measures; (3) advises the Chinese and Japanese representatives to begin discussing and establishing measures with the assistance of the above-mentioned major powers, military and civilian officials. These measures must ensure the cessation of hostilities and stipulate the withdrawal of the Japanese army. Please report the progress of the consultations to the Assembly at any time." (On March 5, the U.S. government indicated that it had instructed its military officials in Shanghai to fully cooperate.) The consultations proposed by various parties began on March 14 in Shanghai. The Committee of Nineteen, organized by the Assembly, twice mediated at the request of China to eliminate various difficulties and finally signed a cease-fire agreement in Shanghai on May 5. On the 6th of the same month, the Japanese army began to withdraw. By May 31, all divisions sent by Japan to Shanghai had re-embarked. Among these divisions, only the 14th Division was reassigned to Manchuria. On July 1, the Assembly received a report stating that only a very small number of Japanese marines were temporarily stationed in a few places adjacent to the Concession and the roads built beyond the boundary, in accordance with the agreement of May 5. Subsequently, these troops were also withdrawn. The Chinese side believes that Japan's intervention in Shanghai caused 24,000 deaths, injuries, and disappearances of Chinese soldiers and civilians, and the material losses are estimated to be worth more than 1.5 billion yuan.</p>
<p>(9) Progress of Japanese Occupation in Manchuria: The Implementation of Administrative Organization; The Constitution of "Manchukuo." While the Shanghai Incident was developing, the situation in Manchuria was also progressing. On February 5, Harbin was occupied by Japanese troops. In the following months, Japanese troops continued to carry out military operations against the remnants of the Chinese army, as well as "volunteer armies," bandits, and various other "informal troops." Small-scale battles spread over a large part of Manchuria. At the same time, administrative reorganization was also taking place. Its initial stages have been described above. On February 17, 1932, a Supreme Administrative Council was established for the entire Manchuria. On February 18, the Council issued a declaration of independence. On February 19, the Japanese representative explained at the Council meeting in Geneva that the meaning of "independence" in Manchuria was the same as the meaning of "autonomy." Japan viewed the success of this independence with a favorable attitude. On March 9, the various local administrative organs were merged into an independent state called "Manchukuo." The position of head of state was inherited by Puyi, the former Xuantong Emperor of the Qing Dynasty. The Chinese government had claimed on November 17, 1931, that the deposed emperor had been abducted by the Japanese from the Japanese Concession in Tianjin and escorted to Shenyang, with the aim of establishing a puppet government with the deposed emperor as emperor. The Chinese government has repeatedly denounced the establishment of this so-called state as illegal, and all the creations and maintenance of this so-called state from its inception and in its subsequent development have been directed and assisted by the Japanese army stationed in Manchuria. (10) Discussions of the Assembly: The Resolution of March 11 Regarding the Decision on the Deadline for Preparing the Report in Accordance with Article 15 of the Covenant. At the same time, the Assembly continued to study the dispute in Geneva. After detailed discussions on March 11, 1932, it passed the following resolution: Section 1, the Assembly, in view of the provisions contained in the Covenant, is fully applicable to this dispute, especially regarding (1) the principle of strict respect for treaties, (2) the promise of member states of the League to respect and maintain the territorial integrity and existing political independence of all members of the League to defend against external aggression, (3) the obligation to resolve all disputes with each other by adopting the principles established in the declaration of December 10, 1931, by Briand, the President of the Council. The twelve members of the Council had reiterated this declaration of principles in their application to the Japanese government on February 16, 1932, declaring that any disregard of the provisions of Article 10 of the Covenant, trampling on the territorial integrity of a member state of the League, and altering its political independence should not be recognized as valid by member states of the League. In view of the above provisions, the principles of international relations of member states of the League and the peaceful resolution of all disputes are fully in line with the Pact of Paris, which is the cornerstone of the world peace mechanism, and Article 2 of which stipulates, "The contracting parties agree that all disputes between them, regardless of their nature or origin, shall be resolved only by peaceful means." Before taking the final steps to resolve the dispute it has accepted, the Assembly declares that the above-mentioned principles and provisions have a binding nature that must be observed and declares that any position, treaty, or agreement obtained by methods that violate the Covenant of the League and the Pact of Paris shall not be recognized by members of the League. Section 2 The Assembly solemnly declares that any resolution of the Sino-Japanese dispute obtained by the use of force by any party is contrary to the spirit of the Covenant. Recalling the resolutions passed by the Council with the consent of both parties on September 20 and December 10, 1931, and recalling the resolution passed by the Assembly itself on March 4, 1932, with the consent of both parties, regarding the effective cessation of hostilities and the withdrawal of the Japanese army, the Assembly is aware that countries with special interests in the Shanghai Concession are fully prepared to assist in this endeavor and requests that these countries fully cooperate to maintain order in the area of withdrawal when necessary. Section 3 The Assembly, in view of the request of the Chinese government on January 29 to apply the procedures of Article 15 of the Covenant of the League to this dispute, in view of the request of the Chinese government on February 12 to submit this dispute to the Assembly in accordance with Section 9 of Article 15 of the Covenant, and in view of the decision of the Council on February 19, considering that the Assembly, having accepted the entirety of the dispute referred to in the request of the Chinese government, should bear the obligation to apply the mediation procedures stipulated in Section 3 of Article 15 of the Covenant and, if necessary, should bear the obligation to apply the procedures of "explanation and recommendation" stipulated in Section 4 of the same article, decides to organize a committee of nineteen members, with the President of the Assembly as the chairman of the committee, together with the members of the Council other than the parties concerned, and representatives of other member states elected by secret ballot. The committee shall perform its duties on behalf of the Assembly and shall be subject to the supervision of the Assembly. It shall (1) promptly report on the cessation of hostilities and the conclusion of agreements in accordance with the Assembly's resolution of March 4, 1923, to effectively stop the war in Shanghai and stipulate the withdrawal of the Japanese army; (2) pay attention to the implementation of the resolutions passed by the Council on September 30 and December 10, 1931; (3) with the consent of both parties and in accordance with the provisions of Section 3 of Article 15 of the Covenant, undertake preparations for resolving the dispute and draft a statement to be submitted to the Assembly; (4) if necessary, propose to the Assembly to submit to the International Court of Justice a request for the expression of opinions; (5) if necessary, undertake preparations for a draft report as stipulated in Section 4 of Article 15; (6) recommend all urgent measures that appear necessary; (7) submit the first report to the Assembly at the earliest possible time, no later than May 1, 1932. The Assembly requests the Council to forward all documents or incidental opinions that it deems should be forwarded to the Assembly to the committee. The Assembly is not adjourned, and the Chairman may convene it when he deems it necessary. On March 12, the U.S. government declared that the measures of the League of Nations Assembly were sufficient to make the principles of security and justice on which the Pact of Non-Aggression and the Covenant of the League of Nations were based become international law. The British government was particularly pleased that the countries of the world were now adopting a united policy of not recognizing the validity of the results of violations of these treaties, which was a special contribution to international law and a solid foundation for peacebuilding. On May 1, 1932, the League of Nations Assembly received a report that the report of the Commission of Inquiry could not be drafted and completed before September. With the consent of both parties, the Assembly decided to extend the six-month period for preparing the report stipulated by the Covenant of the League of Nations to the extent that was truly necessary. When the President of the League of Nations Assembly sent a letter to the Chinese and Japanese representatives on June 24 proposing to extend the deadline stipulated in the Covenant, he stated, "It is my duty to offer a further word. I firmly believe that both parties will abide by their lies in the Council not to expand the situation. This promise has been expressly stated in the resolutions of September 30 and October 10 (1931), and these resolutions still have full executive force. These resolutions will continue to have full force during the extended period after the six-month deadline expires. Your representative will agree with me on this point. What is also brought to your attention is that the resolution passed by the League of Nations Assembly on March 11 has reiterated these two resolutions." After the League of Nations Assembly passed the extension of the deadline, the President of the League of Nations Assembly stated in his letter, "Since this is the case, the decision adopted by the Assembly authorizes me to declare that the parties concerned must not take any action that would jeopardize the success of the work of the Commission of Inquiry or the efforts of the League of Nations to promote a solution."</p>
<p>(11) The Organization of Manchukuo. The procedures for organizing Manchukuo continued while Japan recognized Manchukuo. The government established a central bank and took over the salt tax administration, declaring its willingness to continue to pay the balance of the foreign debt required, which was guaranteed by salt tax revenue. It made the same declaration on customs administration, regarding debts and reparations guaranteed by customs duties, and on postal administration. The creation of Manchukuo's army was aided by Japanese officials who were hired as advisors. In its notification of April 8, 1923, the Japanese government declared that it was currently providing assistance to the Manchukuo army in a friendly spirit to meet its needs for maintaining security and restoring order. According to the Japanese government's opinion in its document of November 18, 1932, the most important bandits in the eastern provinces could be eliminated by Japanese troops in the second and third years. The relationship between Japan and the new organization was also confirmed after General Muto was sent to Changchun, the capital of "</p>

<p>Various agencies and organizations under the jurisdiction of Songjiang County, in order to relieve unemployed vagrants and seek local economic benefits, established the Vagrant Vocational Institute, which was established on January 1st. Director Du Lianhua and Director Zhong Changfeng are managing the affairs. The scale is roughly in place, but at the beginning of the establishment, there is a huge shortage of funds. It is planned to raise donations from all walks of life to subsidize the operation. The fundraising announcement roughly states: Unemployed vagrants in the area endanger social security, which is not a trivial matter. Various groups in our county, in view of this, plan to find ways to provide relief in order to seek social stability. Therefore, preparations were made on January 1st of the 22nd year, and it was officially established to teach knowledge and skills, so that the vagrants will have the hope of self-reliance in the future. However, our institute is just starting, and everything is waiting to be done. The economy is particularly difficult, and the future is long and difficult to maintain. We would like to call on all great philanthropists to donate generously and enthusiastically support us, so that we can gather strength and work together to accomplish this task.</p>

Manager Jiang believes that the bank also handles business in Yixing and Liyang counties, which is beyond its reach. It was decided to set up an office in Liyang starting from now. Staff member Mr. Yang has been sent to preside over the office. In Yixing, an agreement was signed with Hengtai Qianzhuang as an agent to collect and settle deed taxes and negotiate loan matters in the county.</p>

<h3 id="e94">Mutinous Soldiers of Liu's Troops Rampage Daishan Island <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>The other day, seventy to eighty rioters rampaged around Daishan Island. It is said that these rioters were indeed part of Liu Zhennian's troops who had previously mutinied and fled in Wenzhou. They suddenly mutinied in Taishun County, Wenzhou the month before, looting for three days and nights, and then fled to eastern Fujian and Zhejiang, carrying out large-scale looting. Among them, seventy to eighty people carrying weapons seized four small sailing boats on the 14th and fled to Gaoting Town, Daishan, which belongs to Dinghai. The local security team came forward to stop them, and several conflicts broke out. The residents of Gaoting were panicked. Later, after the local people pleaded earnestly and provided rations, they boarded the Da Xing steamer and left Gaoting for Dinghai. After arriving in Dinghai, they landed at Zhushantou, ten miles away from Dinghai, and began to loot. After learning that mutinous soldiers had been found in Daishan, the Dinghai County Government telegraphed the Yong Defense Headquarters and the Zhenhai Water Police Bureau for help. After receiving the telegram, the Defense Headquarters sent thirty to forty soldiers on the Zhenbei Gao steamer to Yue Mountain for defense. The Water Police Bureau has also sent the Flying Eagle patrol boat to assist. It is also reported that the mutinous soldiers in Daishan are fully equipped with guns and ammunition, and they also have machine gunners and grenade launchers.</p>

<p>Yang Jianping, the security brigade adjutant, previously led a team to capture the bandit Ma Saizi in Lao Jia Shan. He also captured kidnappers Shen Changyou and Zhu Leping, as well as the kidnapped victim Huang Zhangshi, in Ao Sun Village under Da Hong Shan. After interrogation, they all confessed to being bandits. In addition to ordering the three kidnapped victims to be claimed by their families, County Chief Li executed the three bandits on the 13th.</p>

<p>Full Text of the League of Nations Report Draft</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The full text of the report drafted by the League of Nations Committee of Nineteen was translated and released by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the evening of the 18th. The original text is as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e96">Draft Report of the League of Nations Assembly <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>The Assembly's efforts in accordance with Article 15, paragraph 3 of the Covenant, to resolve the dispute submitted to the Assembly for discussion in accordance with paragraph 9 of that Article, having unfortunately failed, hereby adopts the following report in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 4 of the same Article, in order to record the facts of the dispute and the recommendations considered fair and appropriate.</p>
<h3 id="e97">Part 1: The Incident in the Far East <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>Adoption of the First Eight Chapters of the League of Nations Inquiry Report and the Plan of This Report: The fundamental causes of the Sino-Japanese dispute are very complex. The investigation team dispatched by the Executive Yuan to conduct on-site research stated that "the various issues contained in this dispute are not as simple as they are often said to be. This case is extremely complex. Only those who have a deep knowledge of all the facts and their historical background can express practical opinions on this case." The first eight chapters of the investigation team's report contain a fair and detailed account of the historical background of the Sino-Japanese dispute and the important facts related to Manchuria. The report has been printed separately. It is impossible and unnecessary to summarize or repeat it here. After studying the written opinions submitted by the Chinese and Japanese governments, the Assembly adopted the opinions in the first eight chapters of the investigation team's report as part of this report. However, in order to make the statement in the investigation team's report complete, the various measures taken by the Executive Yuan and the Assembly on various aspects of this dispute, as well as certain facts not mentioned in the investigation team's report, are described, especially the origin of the Battle of Shanghai in early 1932. Regarding these events, the Assembly adopted the report sent by the consular investigation team of various countries to the Assembly (this report has been printed separately) as part of this report. It is also necessary to restate the details of the Manchurian incidents since the beginning of September 1932, because the investigation team's report did not trace back to that date. A brief historical account of the development of this dispute will be contained in Chapter 2 of this report, and the factual account in the investigation team's report must be consulted at the same time. Chapter 3 states the important features of this dispute and the conclusions drawn by the Assembly based on the main facts. Chapter 4 contains the recommendations that the Assembly considers fair and appropriate for this case.</p>
<h3 id="e98">Sun Ke's Views on the Report <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>(If the powers cannot impose economic sanctions on Japan, this report is also just a piece of paper)</p>
<p>Sun Ke, President of the Legislative Yuan, arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing the night before last. At 10 am yesterday, he met with reporters from various newspapers at his residence on Columbia Road and expressed his opinions on the report of the Committee of Nineteen and the abolition of special laws. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Criticizing the Report: According to Mr. Sun, the report of the Committee of Nineteen of the League of Nations is very fair in determining that Japan should be responsible for the September 18th Incident, not recognizing the puppet organization, and inviting the United States and Russia to participate. It can be said to be satisfactory. However, the main key lies in whether the League of Nations can implement the report. In other words, it can decide not to sanction countries that violate the covenant. According to news from Geneva, the powers are still hesitant to impose economic sanctions on Japan. If the League of Nations cannot use economic sanctions to sanction Japan, which violates the covenant, then this report is also just a piece of paper.</p>
<p>Abolishing Special Laws: At present, in addition to the Criminal Law, our country still has various special laws such as the Law on Punishing Crimes Endangering the Republic of China in Emergency. It is very inconvenient to implement them at the same time. At present, the Legislative Yuan is working on revising the Criminal Law, and plans to include the crimes and penalties of various special laws in it, so that when the revised Criminal Law comes into effect, various special laws can be abolished.</p>
<p>Wu and Sun Talk About the National Political Consultative Council</p>
<h3 id="e99">The Organizational Regulations Have Been Submitted to the Central Political Committee, and the Task of the Regulations Drafting Committee Has Ended <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the organization of the National Political Consultative Council, the Central Political Committee previously appointed Wu Chaochu, Dai Jitao, and others to be responsible for drafting it, so that after it is passed, it can be handed over to the Legislative Yuan to formulate detailed regulations. Yesterday, reporters from the Central News Agency interviewed Mr. Wu Chaochu and Mr. Sun Zhesheng separately to inquire about the progress of this matter. The two gentlemen were received and replied as follows:</p>
<p>Wu Chaochu said: According to Mr. Wu Chaochu, the drafting committee of the organizational regulations of the National Political Consultative Council had gathered several times to discuss various issues related to the organization of the National Political Consultative Council. At present, the opinions of the members on various issues have become consistent and have been passed separately. However, the highest decision-making power on this issue belongs to the Central Political Conference. Therefore, the members have submitted the drafted organizational regulations to the Central Political Conference so that the Political Conference can make the final revisions and decisions, and then hand them over to the Legislative Yuan to formulate detailed regulations. As for the task of the drafting committee of the organizational regulations of the National Political Consultative Council, it has now ended.</p>
<p>Sun Zhesheng said: According to Mr. Sun Zhesheng, the organizational regulations of the National Political Consultative Council will probably be submitted to the Central Political Conference for discussion next week. After they are passed, they will be handed over to the Legislative Yuan to formulate detailed regulations. As for the candidates for the National Political Consultative Council, most of them will be elected and a few will be appointed. The election will be distributed according to the population of each province and city, with a maximum of six people per province and city. The total number is about one hundred people.</p>

<h3 id="e104">Chairman's Opening Speech <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>Chairman Chen Gongbo delivered the opening speech, saying, "Today is the opening day of the Exhibition of Solicited Items for our country's participation in the Chicago Exposition. I am very happy to be able to gather with you all. Our country's participation in the Chicago Exposition began in February of the 19th year, when we received an invitation from the US government. In March of the 20th year, it was approved by the State Council. Due to internal and external troubles, the national crisis became more and more serious. It was not until June of last year that the preparatory committee was officially established and began to work. The estimated preparatory expenses were set at 400,000 yuan. This participation in the Chicago Exposition is of great significance for strengthening Sino-US friendship and developing foreign trade. At the inaugural meeting of the preparatory committee, Gongbo talked about the lessons learned from our country's previous participation in foreign expositions, and that this participation in the Chicago Exposition should use scientific methods to solicit exhibits, and that the government and the people should cooperate to ensure that all preparations are perfect. Since the preparations began last year, many provincial governments and industrial groups have enthusiastically participated in fundraising and soliciting exhibits. However, due to the difficult financial situation in some places, they have missed the opportunity to exhibit. This is something we deeply regret. However, given the current severe domestic situation and the financial difficulties of the central and local governments, we can be satisfied with the current achievements. The preparatory committee intends to create models or charts of the central government's construction plans and achievements in recent years, in addition to ordinary exhibits, to show the progress of our government's efforts to reform and govern after the reform. This exhibit has been contacted by the Ministry and various departments and agencies, and they are actively preparing it. Unfortunately, due to the limited time, they were unable to fully participate in the exhibition. I am very sorry to invite you to review it. Now I will report to you on Gongbo's thoughts on this preparatory exhibit."</p>
<p>Chairman Chen Gongbo Delivering the Opening Speech (Photo by Xu Tianzhang)</p>
<p>"The intention and hope of holding the exhibition of solicited items: (1) In addition to strengthening diplomatic relations, participating in foreign expositions is a good opportunity to promote domestic products and develop foreign trade. Most countries allocate huge sums of money from the government, and officials and civilians jointly prepare exhibits, so the organizers can prepare easily and achieve great results. Our government has financial difficulties and needs the enthusiastic participation and support of the industrial and commercial sectors in order to achieve good results. The preparatory committee has worked hard in this area for this solicitation, so it has been able to achieve today's results. It is hoped that the industrial and commercial sectors will continue to uphold this spirit of cooperation in the future, assist the government in every way, and various industries will have the hope of complete success. (2) In the past, when our country participated in foreign expositions, the exhibits were shipped back after the exhibition. Due to various reasons, some were damaged or lost, and the original items were not returned, so merchants regarded participating in expositions as a dead end. This solicitation has been quite difficult due to this influence, but the Ministry of Industry and Commerce has clearly promulgated the rules for soliciting exhibits, and the preparatory committee has repeatedly stated that it will be fully responsible for the exhibits, except for dangers that cannot be prevented by human power. This can be solemnly declared to the exhibitors. (3) This exhibit adheres to the principle of 'quality over quantity'. During the exhibition period, the preparatory committee will hire experts to conduct a rigorous review of all exhibits. It is hoped that all attendees and visitors will provide as much criticism as possible for reference during the review, and it is hoped that they will provide as much criticism and guidance as possible on the arrangement and display of the exhibits. (4) After this exhibition,"</p>
<p>"the qualified exhibits will be packed and shipped overseas. The preparatory committee and the representatives of the exhibitors who will accompany them to the United States are actively preparing for the future facilities and promotional materials and methods of the venue. It is hoped that the Chinese people will contribute their opinions in order to gather ideas and benefit widely. Although this solicitation for the competition cannot fully reflect the progress of the past century in the same way as other countries in the world, and the preparation is so rushed, Gongbo still hopes to win international praise on the shores of Lake Michigan, so as to learn from others' strengths and make up for our weaknesses, in order to promote the improvement of our industry and the promotion of domestic goods, and to change the situation of foreign trade surplus over the years."</p>
<h3 id="e105">Report on Preparation Progress <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>He Bingxian, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Preparatory Committee, reported on the progress of the preparations, saying: The Preparatory Committee for the Republic of China's participation in the Chicago World's Fair was established on June 15th of last year, and it has been half a year now. During this half year, the Standing Committee of the Preparatory Committee has reported its work to the Preparatory Committee in writing once. That report was a vertical overview of the Standing Committee's activities, that is, the work of the Standing Committee in various aspects was listed separately. Now, due to time constraints, I cannot list them in such detail. I can only select a few important points to report to you. 1. The process of soliciting designs for the Chinese Government Pavilion. Regarding the solicitation of designs for the Chinese Government Pavilion, because we wanted to gather ideas from all sources, we published a solicitation notice in the newspaper. Later, the submitted designs were deemed unsuitable. Either the designs were too grand, which was not allowed by our budget, or they were too simple, and could not reflect the spirit of progress in our country's architecture over the past century. Therefore, the Preparatory Committee invited the Chinese Architects Association to design the pavilion. The Association generously agreed and volunteered to help the Preparatory Committee, for which the Preparatory Committee members are very grateful. The first design was approved by the Association and the Standing Committee. Later, we received a telegram from the Chicago World's Fair in the United States, saying that the area allocated to China had been changed. Because of this, the design was no longer suitable. The Architects Association, without complaint, designed a second design for us. The Standing Committee of the Preparatory Committee was very satisfied with this design and decided to adopt it. The design hanging here is this one. There is also a wooden model made according to this design, which is displayed on the first floor. After the meeting, please go and visit it. 2. Preparation situation for exhibits from various provinces. Director Cai will give a detailed report on the detailed situation of exhibits from various provinces later. Now I will briefly report on the organizations in various provinces responsible for collecting exhibits. The Zhejiang Provincial Government and the Hangzhou Municipal Government established a "Hangzhou to Participate in the Chicago World's Fair" organization. The Jiangxi Provincial Government established a "Jiangxi to Participate in the Chicago World's Fair" organization. In Guangzhou, a "Guangdong and Guangxi to Participate in the Chicago World's Fair Preparatory Office" was established. The remaining provinces, such as Hubei, Hunan, Anhui, Fujian, and Shaanxi, also established exhibit preparation offices. In the United States, there is also a "Preparatory Office for Chinese Painters Studying in the United States to Participate in the Chicago World's Fair." 3. Publicity plan. The Preparatory Publicity Department decided to focus on publicity in the United States. In order to make the world truly understand the actual situation of China's scientific and cultural progress over the past century, it is preparing to publish seven kinds of English pamphlets: 1. Our country's health undertakings; 2. The progress of Chinese science; 3. The progress of Chinese education; 4. Chinese agriculture; 5. Chinese industry; 6. Chinese silk; 7. Chinese tea. Each of these pamphlets contains about 40,000 words, and the Publicity Department has invited experts to write them. The purpose of these pamphlets is, on the negative side, to explain foreigners' misunderstandings about our country, and on the positive side, to enable them to understand our country's inherent culture and recent progress. 4. The task of sending a special envoy to the United States. Because the date of the Chicago World's Fair is very near, the Preparatory Committee has requested the Chairman to send someone to the United States to prepare everything. The Chairman has now appointed Guo Weibai, a member of the Preparatory Committee and Deputy Director of the Office, to go. His task is to supervise the construction of the Chinese Government Pavilion and negotiate the lease of land. Before the official appointment of the Chinese government representative, he will represent the Preparatory Committee to negotiate everything with the United States. 5. The purpose of the exhibit exhibition and the responsibilities of each committee member. The purpose of this exhibit exhibition is to publicly display various exhibits in the country before they are shipped to the United States, so that they can receive criticism and guidance from people from all walks of life. Originally, the Preparatory Committee also organized various review committees and invited experts to serve as reviewers. However, in order to gather ideas from all sources, we also ask you to visit and give your criticisms and guidance without reservation. Because these exhibits represent China's participation, in order to show China's progress over the past century and to make the world truly understand China, the Preparatory Committee members and the members of the review committee should certainly do their best to shoulder this responsibility. We hope that you will also take on this responsibility and generously give us all your criticisms and guidance.</p>
<h3 id="e106">Report on the Progress of Collecting Exhibits <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>Cai Wuji, Director of the Exhibit Department, reported on the progress of collecting exhibits, saying: Today is the opening of the Republic of China's Chicago World's Fair exhibit exhibition. I am very pleased to have officials and guests present. I was appointed Director of the Exhibit Department in June of last year, and I should give a brief report on all the circumstances of the exhibits to clarify the process. The most difficult aspects of collecting exhibits were: one was the items, and the other was the region. In terms of items, there are countless evolutionary items related to industry, agriculture, art, and science, such as Jiangxi's porcelain, Fujian's lacquerware, and silk, tea, and silk fabrics from other provinces. In terms of region, China is vast, and the provinces are far apart, and transportation is still not very convenient in many places. After repeated discussions, we decided that the purpose of collecting exhibits was to emphasize quality over quantity. On one hand, we asked the governments and organizations of various provinces and cities to assist in collecting exhibits. In August and September, we successively established exhibit sub-committees in Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Hunan, Hubei, Fujian, Guangdong and other provinces, which made the work more organized. Furthermore, it was difficult to motivate the exhibits from various regions if we did not personally contact them. Therefore, I and Miao Zhongxiu, the Deputy Director of the Exhibit Department, went to Zhejiang, Nanjing, Beiping, Tianjin, Yantai, Guangdong, Guangxi, Hong Kong, Xiamen, Shantou, Fujian and other places to contact them separately and promote them effectively. Now, the products from various provinces have been sent to the exhibition one after another, and they are so beautiful that one can't take it all in. Among them, the Nanjing's Nanjing silk brocade, Hangzhou's silk fabrics, Jiangxi's porcelain, and Beiping Jingxingzhai's jade lacquer carving tools, etc., have been successfully completed after a lot of time and effort. It is now estimated that there are more than 7,000 items, and although I dare not say that this is unprecedented compared to previous exhibitions, I feel that there has indeed been a lot of progress. China is a vast land with abundant resources, and if we can collect as much as possible, it should be more than this. Now, due to time and regional restrictions, omissions are unavoidable, and I must ask you to forgive me. The process of collecting exhibits is as described above. The Preparatory Committee originally intended to organize a review committee for the exhibits, and invited celebrities from all walks of life to review them. However, I thought that some of the exhibits collected this time might be advanced products in recent years, so it would be better to hold a public exhibition for all to visit. Therefore, we took this opportunity to review the exhibits and decided to hold an exhibit exhibition, and the Academia Sinica graciously lent us the new building here as the exhibition venue, which is something we are very grateful for. After we had a definite address, we moved the exhibit department, which was originally located on the Museum Road, to this place for office work in early January. As for the exhibition, it was originally scheduled to start on February 4, but the preparations started in mid-December of last year, and the procedures for displaying exhibits were extremely troublesome. In addition, the exhibits from afar had not yet been transported at that time, so we had to postpone the opening to today. Initially, we planned to open it very publicly without admission tickets, but because Shanghai is densely populated, if it were opened for free, it would inevitably be too crowded. In order to maintain order at the exhibition, we printed long-term tickets and ordinary tickets, and charged a small fee to limit the number of visitors. In summary, the exhibition will be open for only two full months from preparation to opening. The reason for the urgency is that the exhibits must be loaded onto ships at the end of February in order to arrive in time for the opening of the Chicago International Exposition on June 1. Although I know that this exhibition will inevitably be rushed due to time constraints, and the results of the exhibition may not be as good as expected, since I</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>have undertaken the responsibility of preparation, I have always been devoted to my work, only advancing, never retreating. Therefore, during the two months of preparation, I supervised the staff, overcame all difficulties, and worked day and night. Even during the holidays, we all worked as usual. Today, we have managed to open the exhibition, but I still feel that the layout is not perfect, and it is inevitable that there will be some roughness and messiness. I must ask gentlemen from all walks of life to give as much guidance as possible, which is what I sincerely ask for. Because of the limited time today, I will only give this brief report. A detailed written report will be given in the future. Now, I will not go into details. In addition, I should also take this opportunity to express my gratitude to those who assisted in the collection and display of the exhibits, who gave us a lot of help.</p>
<h3 id="e107">Chu Minyi's Address <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>Chu Minyi, representative of the Executive Yuan, gave an address, saying: Today, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce is holding an exhibit exhibition in Shanghai in preparation for participating in the Chicago World's Fair. We must know that international exhibitions are held every few years. China participated in the Belgian exhibition in 1919. China did not participate in the Paris exhibition because it had colonial characteristics. China held the Nanyang Industrial Exposition 30 years ago. In recent years, China has participated in exhibitions in other countries more than once. However, the items we participate with are always porcelain, lacquerware, tea, silk, and so on. This year, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce specially set up an exhibit department to find ways to collect exhibits that can show the strengths of Chinese goods. Exhibitions have a great relationship with industry and commerce, and can enable Chinese goods to be sold abroad. In recent years, the foreign trade of our country's silk, tea, and other products has been severely hit. We must find ways to improve international trade. Participating in the exhibition is a new invention in the form of substantive improvements to commercial warfare methods.</p>
<h3 id="e108">Wu Tiecheng's Speech <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>Mayor Wu Tiecheng said in his speech: Today, the Republic of China's exhibit exhibition for participating in the Chicago World's Fair is being held in Shanghai, which is the most glorious event for Shanghai. After visiting various exhibits, we thought that in the process of continuous warfare and natural disasters in our country in recent years, the progress of industry has been so great, which is a comforting event. At the same time, we see the trend of Chinese industry, such as Fujian lacquerware and Jiangxi porcelain, which are very expensive and are only displayed as antiques, which are not needed by ordinary people. This shows that the progress of industry and manufacturing has not completely shaken off the old system. Therefore, people still prefer to buy foreign goods. Now, the first thing we must do is to promote industry, focusing on daily necessities. The porcelain kilns in Jingdezhen, Jiangxi, were originally used to supply the emperor, and if they continue to improve every day, it will not have a significant relationship with international fame. The second is to promote industry, which requires the government and the people to cooperate and find ways to improve commerce. The reason why industry cannot develop is that the organization of commercial institutions is incomplete. Commercial institutions should be responsible for promoting and improving how to sell industry. I hope that the government and the people will work together to promote industry. We believe that under such an effort, within a few years, China can open a large-scale exposition, and countries will also come to participate.</p>
<h3 id="e109">Speech by the American Consul <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>The American Commercial Consul An Laisi gave a speech in English, which was translated as follows: Today, on behalf of the American Department of Commerce, I am participating in the Republic of China's exhibit exhibition for participating in the Chicago World's Fair. Last year, I discussed the participation plan with the Minister of Industry and Commerce and the Exhibit Committee. The land allocated to China in Chicago is very important, close to the river.</p>
<p>It can attract the attention of visitors. At the same time, I hope that China can make full use of it. Sino-American friendship is valued by the general public. In the future, many people will visit the Chinese Pavilion, which can increase the friendly impression between the two countries. Now, when China is in a very difficult time, being able to take the exhibits to participate in the exhibition can represent the spirit of China and the progress of China. Therefore, on the one hand, it can arouse the concept of friendly people from both countries, and at the same time, it can increase commercial relations. On behalf of the American Department of Commerce, I express my full satisfaction with China's participation in the exhibition in the midst of all kinds of difficulties.</p>
<h3 id="e110">Display of Famous and Valuable Treasures <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>The products from various provinces and cities participating in the Chicago World's Fair have been transported to Shanghai, and the exhibit exhibition has been completed as of yesterday, with a total of more than 8,000 items, all of which are famous and unparalleled treasures.

<p>Property Owners Association Petition Unsuccessful Amid Water Cutoffs</p>

<p>Shanghai Property Owners Association representatives Yan Yanfang, Shen Jixuan, Guo Zusheng, and eight others, based on the resolution of the members' meeting, went to the Shanghai Municipal Government yesterday afternoon to petition, requesting negotiations with the Public Concession authorities to first open the water pipes for those who have had their water cut off, in order to save the lives of citizens, etc. Unexpectedly, yesterday was Saturday, and it was already the afternoon when it was the regular holiday. Mayor Wu and Secretary-General Yu were not in the City Hall. The representatives then went to the Chicago World's Fair Exhibit Preparatory Committee again to meet them, but both Wu and Yu were not there. So they rescheduled to petition the City Hall again at 10:00 AM on the 20th of the month (tomorrow).</p>
<h3 id="e114">Tense Situation/Water Cutoff with Force Continuing <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>As the water supply problem becomes more and more tense, the water company continues to cut off water with force. Yesterday afternoon around 2:00 PM, a foreign staff member of the company led five or six workers and more than a dozen armed police officers to Zhoujiapai Road, Yangshupu, to cut off the water in Shunchengli. There are 198 houses and more than 200 tenants in this neighborhood. For a time, the water source was cut off, and there was no way to appeal. After receiving the news, the landlord, Huada Company, immediately rushed to the Property Owners Association to report and ask for help.</p>
<h3 id="e115">Residents in Two Locations Demand Water from Municipal Council <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday around 10:00 AM, residents of Weishuifang, Zhejiang Road, gathered 60-70 residents from the entire neighborhood, each carrying a lead bucket, and lined up to the Municipal Council Office at the corner of Hankou Road and Jiangxi Road to demand water because they had no water to drink. The General Patrol Room had received news in advance and dispatched a large number of Chinese and foreign patrol officers nearby in advance. When the residents arrived at their destination, a large team of patrol officers used batons to disperse the crowd, who went southeast. Not long after, more than 300 residents of Sanxingfang, Tangshan Road, Pudong, also each carried buckets and cans, and walked in formation from the northeast. When the patrol officers saw this, they again used batons to disperse them. Wang Yaozeng, Wu Wenyuan, and ten other representatives of the tenants of the neighborhood, entered the Municipal Council and asked Director-General Fessenden to answer. He De Kui, the director of the meeting, postponed the meeting. The representatives asked the Municipal Council to immediately order the water company to restore the water supply. He transferred the purpose of the representatives to state. Then, He came out and replied that Fessenden could go to the water company to contact him before this afternoon, and asked the representatives to come to the office next Monday to wait for a response. He did not get any results and left. Also, in order to maintain order in Sanxingfang, the Municipal Council has ordered the relevant police station to send two Chinese patrol officers to suppress it, so as to avoid accidents.</p>
<h3 id="e116">Opinions of Jiang Bingsheng, Standing Committee Member of the Property Owners Association <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>Jiang Bingsheng, a standing committee member of the Shanghai Property Owners Association, believes that the report of the American expert Mr. Hill is indeed fair, but the measures of the British Shanghai Water Company, although based on the report, are actually drawing a tiger and resembling a dog, and are even more intensified. Yesterday, he specially summarized Mr. Hill's report and added notes, and sent it to the Property Owners Association for reference. The following is a record: Mr. Hill said that the purpose of all public utilities is to supply goods at the lowest price, and the quality is suitable for the needs of users. Mr. Hill said that the public utility of water should pay more attention to safe and fixed supply than other public utilities. Where is the so-called safety and fixed supply when the company often cuts off water as a threat? Mr. Hill said that measuring the water sold with water meters is the only reasonable and fair way to open a water plant, because it can prevent unfairness and mutual discrimination for users. Mr. Hill said that installing water meters is the only effective way to limit household waste and is an economical way. The above-mentioned water meters refer to household installations, not total water meters. Mr. Hill said that the company's chief engineer once estimated that if all water meters were replaced, the daily consumption per person per household could be reduced from 33 gallons to 2 gallons. This also refers to household water meters. The so-called daily per person per household is the meaning of per household. Mr. Hill said that I believe that when discussing fair value and encountering exchange rate problems, to obtain a fixed water price standard, a fair average exchange rate must be used. If the income is calculated in silver, then the approved value should also be calculated in silver. "This is also obvious. "Mr. Hill said that in terms of the safety of investment, the certainty of income, and the market sales, the interest and income of Shanghai's main business are relatively high, especially when the company has to bear the exchange rate risk of its capital value. However, this danger has been discussed in this chapter and can be avoided by calculating capital in silver. "Also, the French Water and Electricity Company installs meters on a household basis, with no meter fee and no deposit. The Nanshi Water Company installs meters on a household basis, with no meter fee, and only collects a deposit. The Zhabei Water Company installs meters on a household basis, with no meter fee, and only collects a deposit. The British Shanghai Water Company has always charged users for installing water meters, and only collects a deposit, without any meter fee.</p>

<p>The Municipal Council Information Office sent a letter to this newspaper, saying: To the Editor of Shen Bao, On the 17th of this month, your newspaper published a report on the water cutoff incident in Sanxingfang, Tangshan Road, which stated that residents elected representatives, went to this Bureau, and were personally received by Director-General Zhong Sijun, who also had a conversation, saying that the water meter installation was decided by the Municipal Council, and that the company cut off the water because the water fee had not been collected, which was not against the law. After investigation, Zhong Sijun did not meet with these representatives on that day, nor did he make such a statement. I am sending this letter to you for correction. Yours sincerely, The Editing Department of Shen Bao, 18th.</p>

The association president Wang Binyan convened a standing committee meeting, which was attended by Wang Binyan, Tu Hesheng, Tu Zhensheng, Mei Hezhang Liu Hongdang, Liu Shaoyun, Liu Wenzao, and forty others. President Wang Binyan, after observing all formalities, Xu Yuanqing proposed a plan to raise funds for a Changzhou aircraft. After discussion and resolution, the participants actively moved forward but effective strategy should be devised to bring this about in the short term. The association has designated representatives to immediately contact overseas associations in various provinces to cooperate in the implementation.</p>
<p>Li Zongtong Talks About the First Batch of Antiquities Moved South</p>
<h3 id="e119">Siku Quanshu is Complete and Intact/Scattered Word Plate is from the Shang and Zhou Dynasties/Kuai Xue Shi Qing is the Most Precious <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency reports: The first batch of 2,118 boxes of antiquities from the Palace Museum that were moved south have long been transported to Pukou. The storage location was originally designated as No. 26, Rue de l'Eglise, French Concession, Shanghai, but the Central Political Conference decided to move them to Bianluo for storage. However, yesterday's Beijing news said that Bianluo does not have a suitable storage location and will still be transported to Shanghai. In order to clarify the truth, the Central News Agency reporter specially visited Li Zongtong, Secretary-General of the Palace Museum, who had just arrived in Shanghai from Beiping, yesterday morning. He answered as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e120">Address Still Undecided <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>There are three places in Beiping that store antiquities: the Palace Museum, the Antiquities Exhibition Hall, and the Peking University Library. The Exhibition Hall and Peking University have had fires, and some of the calligraphy and paintings are missing. The antiquities moved south this time are from the Palace Museum. The first batch has a total of 2,118 boxes. The previous rumor that three boxes were damaged is completely untrue. The first batch originally scheduled to be moved south was 2,121 boxes, but three of the calligraphy and painting boxes were extremely long and could not fit in the carriages, so they were temporarily suspended. The rumor that they were damaged due to careless handling is not aware of the care taken during handling. The box items are numbered and the names of the handlers are registered for responsibility. The assembly of the box items is very strong and would not be damaged even if they fell to the ground. This batch of antiquities has arrived in Pukou. After the Central Political Conference decided to move them to Bianluo, a telegram was sent to Bianluo to find a storage location. Now it is known that it is difficult to find a suitable location in Bianluo for the time being, so there is a proposal to transport them to Beijing for storage, but it has not been determined yet.</p>
<h3 id="e121">First Batch of Valuables <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>Among the first batch of antiques, there are over six hundred boxes of the "Siku Quanshu" (Complete Library of the Four Treasuries), red books, and historical records.</p>
<p>These account for one train car. The rest are jade artifacts, bronzes, porcelain, carvings, calligraphy, and paintings, etc. There were originally seven copies of the "Siku Quanshu" in the country, but only three remain. The one remaining in Beiping is the Wen Yuan Ge copy, the one in Jehol is the Wen Wei Ge copy, and the one in Shenyang was looted by the Japanese army during their invasion of Shenyang. The remaining copy is the Wen Su Ge copy. The Wen Lan Ge copy in Hangzhou is incomplete. The copy being transported south this time is the one stored in the Wen Yuan Ge in Beiping, which is the most meticulously edited and accurate. The red books are the complete set of imperial edicts from the Kangxi and Qianlong Emperors of the former Qing dynasty. The historical records are summaries of Qing dynasty memorials, all of which are extremely valuable items. Among the calligraphy and paintings, Wang Xizhi's "Kuaixue Shiqing" (Timely Clearing After a Quick Snowfall) is the most precious, as Wang Xizhi's original works are already rare. This piece is also one of the "Three Rarities." It was recently rumored in Beiping that there was a calligraphic couplet by Wang Xizhi, but that is not accurate. Among the bronzes, the "San Zi Pan" (Three-Character Basin) dates from the Shang and Zhou dynasties. The basin has many characters inscribed on it, sufficient for archaeological research. Among the porcelain, "Guyuexuan" porcelain is the most famous and valuable, all of which dates from the early Qing dynasty. There is also a bronze figure, in a half-kneeling position, holding a piece of white paper, which can write the eight characters "Ba Fang Xiang Hua, Jiu Tu Lai Wang" (Eight Directions Turn Towards Civilization, Nine Lands Come to Pay Homage). It was a gift from England during the Qianlong Emperor's celebratory birthday. In addition, there are large self-ringing clocks, which play music when they strike the hour, and large jade mountain dog mirrors, etc., which could not be moved due to their extraordinary bulkiness. Mr. Li also said that when they were moved south, the president of the Song dynasty academy telegraphed to the local people in Beiping, expressing that the southward movement of the antiques was to protect the lifeblood of Chinese culture and had no other meaning. As soon as the situation stabilizes slightly, they will be moved back to their original locations for preservation.</p>
<p>Sudden Increase in Shipments from the Yangtze River</p>
<h3 id="e122">Fear of Japanese Military Blocking Sea Ports <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>Recently, the situation in North China has become tense. Japanese warships on the Yangtze River have been increasing in number since the 15th. In addition, newspapers are reporting that the Japanese military will blockade our ports after hostilities break out. After this news spread, Yangtze River merchant guilds have been telegraphing Shanghai frequently, urging the early transport of goods that have already been purchased. Therefore, since the 17th, export goods on the Yangtze River ships of the six companies in this port have suddenly become congested, increasing by one or two times compared to the previous few days. This is because they deeply fear that transportation will be cut off after the war, and therefore merchants are expediting the shipment of goods in advance.</p>

<h3 id="e130">Draft Budget of the Public Works Department of the Municipal Council <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>The budget of the Public Works Department of the Municipal Council for this year has been reviewed by the Public Works Committee and submitted to the Board of Directors on Wednesday of this week. All items that have been approved will be listed in the draft general budget, pending further review by the Finance Committee.</p>
<p>Regular Expenditure Under the heading of regular expenditure, excluding education expenses, the total amount of expenditure after several reductions is 4,287,490 taels. This figure is approximately 72,000 taels more than last year. The initial estimate in November of last year exceeded the number by more than 210,000 taels.) Items reduced include one water truck by 18,000 taels, one road roller by 8,000 taels, lawn mowers reduced to 600 taels, typewriters reduced to 1,300 taels, file cabinets reduced to 2,000 taels, furniture and sundries reduced to 8,000 taels. In addition, the cost of automobile transportation has increased compared to the past. This is because the cars used by the bureau are of different styles, the work is tighter, and the drivers need two shifts, so the expenditure is relatively large. However, the Public Works Department is constantly paying attention to savings. In addition, there is 120,000 taels under the item of garbage transportation fees, which is a donation indirectly paid to the Municipal Government.</p>
<p>Temporary Expenditure Under the heading of temporary expenditure, according to convention, those that the Board of Directors has already approved or considered urgent are marked with the letter "A," and those that are deemed unnecessary to spend this year due to financial or other reasons are marked with the letter "C." After joint consideration by the Finance Department and the Public Works Department, the temporary needs of each department this year, excluding the repayment of public bonds and the allocation of necessary funds, total approximately 8 million taels. If this is done, it will also require adding a burden of approximately 500,000 taels in the coming year, because this includes the medical improvement fee and the educational construction fee plan. The acting director of the Finance Department believes that when preparing the budget, the amounts proposed by each department must be effectively reduced. The following items have all been considered:</p>
<p>Bridge Construction Fee The construction of a new bridge on Suzhou Creek on Jiangxi Road was originally planned to allocate 50,000 taels this year. The Director of Public Works believes that it can be delayed, so it has been marked with the letter "C." The tail end of the Tang En Road Bridge costs 920 taels, marked with the letter "A." The cement bridge on the Kulun Road Sha Jing Port is listed at 15,000 taels, and the cement bridge on the Jiaxing Road Hongkou Creek is listed at 20,000 taels, both marked with the letter "A." The cost of repairing riverbanks in various places is 20,000 taels, also marked with the letter "A."</p>
<p>Ditch and Canal Fee All drainage ditch fees, except for those on Qiqihar Road, Pingliang Road, and Meizhou Road, which are listed with the letter "C," are marked with the letter "A." The Director of Public Works believes that this work is already lagging behind. For the sake of developing and maintaining roads, this repair ditch fee cannot be delayed. In addition, the cost of repairing sewage ditches is 295,000 taels, listed with the letter "A." Building a pumping station on Putuo Road costs 20,000 taels, listed with the letter "C." Installing a manure loading station costs 5,000 taels, listed with the letter "A." In addition, the pumping equipment in various places costs a total of 46,000 taels, reduced by 2,500 taels, also listed with the letter "A."</p>
<p>Wharf Fee The remaining funds for the Qiwupu Road wharf are listed at 145,000 taels. Because part has already been spent, it has been changed to 115,000 taels, listed with the letter "A." The remaining amount for the Zhaofeng Road wharf is 10,000 taels, listed with the letter "A."</p>
<p>Park Fee The remaining amount for purchasing land for the Singapore Road Park is 175,000 taels, listed with the letter "A." In accordance with the previous discussion, a model boat pool is listed for Zhaofeng Park, costing 20,000 taels. After discussion, it was listed with the letter "C." Paving grass and building slopes on the protruding area of Hongkou Park near the shooting range to create a ball field costs 3,000 taels. After discussion, it was marked with the letter "A." In addition, the two parks on Jiaozhou Road and Poyang Road also have slight expansion costs.</p>
<p>Construction Fee Expanding the greenhouse in Zhaofeng Park costs 3,000 taels, listed with the letter "A." In addition, building fences for the visitor tea and snack area costs 7,500 taels, also listed with the letter "A." The cost of adding equipment to the two incinerator plants is 43,000 taels, listed with the letter "A." A storage room and office in Xinzha costs 18,000 taels. The tail end of the Xinzha freight car room costs 15,000 taels, and the Tongzhou freight car room costs 35,000 taels. All three items are listed with the letter "A." If possible, the Public Works Department will still reduce them. In addition, a cement cargo shed in Xinzha costs 12,000 taels, adding toilets in various places costs 15,000 taels, and public drinking pools cost 3,000 taels, all of which are also listed with the letter "A."</p>
<p>Road Fee The extension and widening of roads and the purchase of land, etc., were originally listed at 1.8 million taels. Based on last year's experience and the Board of Directors' policy of gradual progress in collecting local taxes, the Director of Public Works proposed that this item be changed to 1.4 million taels, which is listed with the letter "A." In addition, the road repair fee was originally listed at 392,800 taels. The Director of Public Works stated that last year 350,000 taels were listed, which was already overspent. It is difficult to estimate the amount of this expenditure within a year's range, but the Public Works Department's road repair plan in recent years is insufficient to meet the public's needs, especially in the eastern district. Therefore, even if we proceed cautiously, we are still afraid that this number will be insufficient. The number was then revised to 400,000 taels, listed with the letter "A."</p>

<p>Yesterday, the North and South Market rice merchants held a joint meeting at the Cuixiu Hall of the Bean and Rice Industry Association. More than 100 people attended. Zhu Zixiang was elected as chairman. After the meeting was opened, it was reported that the industry had reduced the commission paid to customers by two tenths of the original commission. However, the rebates to store owners have not only not been reduced, but have even exceeded the regulations, which is regrettable. Now that we have received letters from colleagues requesting the rectification of commissions, it should be filed for discussion. It was decided that the current rebate is six tenths, with accounts cleared at the end of the month, and the rebate is three tenths, with accounts not cleared at the end of the month, and there will be no rebate at all to prevent sabotage. For the sake of the resolution, a small group will be established to supervise each other to ensure compliance. 2) After the industry used the city dipper, due to thrift and consumption, the authorities allowed the use of six-dipper city dippers. However, outsiders did not understand the truth and pointed out that it was a discarding of government orders. However, the simultaneous use of five-dipper and six-dipper dippers does not result in any loss for either the industry or customers. It should be discussed whether it hinders the new system of unified weights and measures. It was decided that the new measuring instruments should be promoted in accordance with the One Two Five decree and the five-dipper city dipper should be used. It was decided that starting from the 21st, the five-dipper city dipper will be approved for use, and all six-dipper city dippers will be discarded to comply with government orders.</p>

<h3 id="e136">The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Asks the Municipal Council to Strictly Arrest Bandits <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Shanghai International Settlement Municipal Council yesterday, requesting strict arrest of bandits in the settlement. The original letter stated, "We are writing to you to inform you that on the morning of the 17th of this month, the Shanghai Clock and Watch Industry Association sent a letter stating that, according to reports from members such as Meihuali, Hengdali, Yitaixiang, Zhongmei, Shi Weiji, Hengdeli, Maodeli, Huade on Nanjing Road, and Yicheng, Nanchang, Yuanyuan, Yuchang, Lehua, and Samsung on Fuzhou Road, the Shanghai Settlement is a district where commercial gatherings from around the country, and it is also a den where bandits are hiding. In recent years, bandits have specialized in robbing clock and watch shops. The patrol police have not yet solved the cases. The time of the robbery is usually between 5:00 PM and 9:00 PM. For example, the Nanchang Clock and Watch Shop on Fuzhou Road was robbed on February 2nd, losing watches worth more than 1,000 yuan. That incident occurred at around 6:30 PM. Although the bandits take advantage of this twilight opportunity when the lights are not yet on, it is also due to the patrol police's lack of thorough protection. Moreover, the patrol police rarely solve cases of theft from Chinese merchants. We Chinese people bear the obligation of paying taxes, and it does not seem appropriate to treat us with prejudice. We should ask your council to correct this." According to this, the 38th Executive Committee meeting discussed and decided that the repeated theft cases in the settlement are due to the patrol police's negligence, and the Chamber should send letters to the Chinese Ratepayers Association and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, transferring the matter to the Municipal Council for negotiation. The patrol police should be strictly ordered to increase the number of patrol police patrolling Nanjing and Fuzhou Roads every day from 5:00 PM to 9:00 PM, and supervise and urge the patrol police to arrest the criminals in the theft cases that have occurred as soon as possible, in order to eliminate the harm in the bud. These words are recorded in the minutes. In addition to sending letters to the Chinese Ratepayers Association, we have always looked up to your council as a model for the Chamber of Commerce to rescue and respond to emergencies. We are sending this letter to request you to investigate and promptly transfer the matter to the Municipal Council for handling, to fulfill our public duty. It is a matter of public interest to you. The fact that Fuzhou Road is a prosperous location in the settlement, and the time between 6:00 PM and 7:00 PM is the peak of commercial activity, the theft that occurred at Nanchang Clock and Watch Shop this time. If the patrol police had been adequately prepared beforehand, the bandits would not have dared to be so bold and reckless. After the robbery, they were able to remain at large. Your bureau should be responsible for the protection of Chinese and foreign merchants in the settlement. The accident caused by the patrol police's negligence should be given special attention. We must solve the case and recover the stolen goods as soon as possible. In accordance with the information in the letter, we hereby write to your bureau to request you to investigate and handle the matter accordingly. To the Public Concession Bureau of Public Works, this is addressed.</p>

<p>Shao Wansheng The labor dispute over the dismissal of employees at the Shao Wansheng dried goods store on Nanjing Road was resolved yesterday when the store's manager, Shen Songgao, in order to avoid prolonging the dispute, invited Yu Yaoqiu, a representative of the dried goods workers' union, to discuss a resolution. As a result, the company provided subsidies to the dismissed employees as severance pay. The union representative immediately returned to the union to report the situation to the store's employees. The employees were also willing to settle the matter peacefully and expressed their acceptance. The union representative, Yu Yaoqiu, then collected the full amount of the severance pay, declared the resolution, and reported it to the party and government organs to close the case.</p>
<p>Dasheng Cotton Weaving Factory The Dasheng Cloth Factory on Zhongxing Road in Zhabei announced its closure this month and dismissed all 69 male and female workers, filing a case with the party and government organs.

<p>Change of Method for the Rising Water Ball at the Pao Taiwan</p>
<h3 id="e139">Change of High Water Ball to High Water Board and Proposed Addition of Storm Warning Red Light <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>In the past, the Jianghai Customs River Conservancy established several flat houses (commonly known as flag-raising rooms) at the Wusong Fort, Taiwan Pu Wharf. They appointed Pang Baolin, Song Yinlang, and others familiar with navigation to be stationed there, specifically to manage and protect the safety of shipping lanes and ensure the smooth passage of ships. Next to the houses, there were massive lighthouses and tall masts, each. At the top of the lighthouses, large lights shone in four colors—green, yellow, black, and red—according to the cardinal directions, the light beams reaching far to serve as beacons for incoming ships. On the masts, large black (circular bamboo) balls were hoisted, called high-water balls. As the Sanjia Estuary is a crucial thoroughfare for ships of all nations entering and leaving Shanghai, daily and nightly shifts were assigned to officials to watch over it. The height of the tide was indicated by the hoisting of the balls at any time, and lights were displayed at night to report the water level to prevent obstructions. A "half-foot ball" was typically used; for example, if the level was 30 feet 5 inches, the "30 and a half-foot" ball was raised. If the level rose another five inches, the "31-foot" ball would be raised. Now, the Shipping Bureau has newly established regulations, planning to abolish the half-foot ball to avoid confusion. It is also heard that the current round balls will be replaced with square balls, with each square ball representing five feet. Two square balls hung together would indicate a rise of ten feet. The high-water balls will be replaced by high-water boards, pointed at the top and flat at the bottom. When the tide rises, the pointed end will face upwards; when the tide recedes, the pointed end will face downwards. At night, a green light and a white light will each be hoisted: when the tide rises, the green light will be above and the white light below; when the tide recedes, the white light will be above and the green light below. Furthermore, it is planned to add a red light to warn of storms to prevent navigational dangers. These newly established regulations have not yet been promulgated.</p>

<p>The situation in Northeast China grows more perilous by the day. Under the sneering face of war, countless of our compatriots are sacrificing themselves on the battlefields. The China Benevolent Childcare Association, in preparation for aiding children in the North China war zone, has specially dispatched Deputy Director Chen Tiesheng, who departed from Shanghai this morning to inspect areas in Beiping, Tianjin, Rehe, and Luanxian. He will also liaise with local legal entities to jointly discuss child relief efforts. According to Mr. Chen, this trip north involves very arduous duties, which he will handle as opportunities arise, doing his utmost. However, he fears that it will not be something that can be accomplished in a short period of time.</p>
<p>Murder Case Solved</p>
<h3 id="e141">Cause of Death of Ms. Lu Mao Established, Wang Jinyun Arrested the Night Before <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>Lu Mao, a housewife who ran a barber shop at No. 219 Yaoshui Lane, Xiaoshadu, West Shanghai, was suddenly confronted on January 26th at about 5:20 AM by two thugs speaking with a Northern accent and wearing long blue cloth robes. The thugs dragged her out and shot her in a premeditated act of revenge, hitting vital organs, and she died almost instantly. It has now been learned that the truth behind the shooting is that there were three or four thugs, all residing in Meifang Li on Roberts Road, West Shanghai. They had learned that Lu, the barber shop owner, had some savings and had coveted it for a long time, but lacked an opportunity. As it was approaching the end of the lunar year, they went to Lu to extort 200 silver dollars under false pretenses. They were menacing, coaxing and compelling, and pestered him several times without success. The shop owner Lu, fearing their continued harassment, temporarily hid elsewhere. On that morning, just before dawn, the thugs assumed that Lu would be at home and went with their guns. To their surprise, they stormed into the shop but could not find Lu anywhere. Enraged, they dragged out the housewife, Lu Mao. Realizing the danger, she loudly called for help. Knowing that their plan had failed, the thugs shot her to vent their anger, and then fled. After receiving a report, Gu Wentao, a patrol officer from the 6th Precinct of Roberts Road, took charge of the investigation due to the seriousness of the case. He received information that one of the perpetrators, Wang Jinyun, was hiding with his concubine in No. 808 Changan Road, Zhabei. Officer Gu, along with Detective Team Leader Xia Pinshan, Deputy Team Leader Tang Bingsheng, and Detective Cao Chuqiao, secretly went to the address the night before. They arrested Wang Jinyun (from Henan) and his concubine Wang Zhao on the spot and took them back to the station for temporary detention, pending further investigation and pursuit of the other accomplices.</p>
<p>Tram Crushes Liu Yongyuan in Tragic Accident</p>
<h3 id="e142">Body Examined Yesterday Morning <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>Liu Yongyuan, age 21, from Suzhou, resided at No. 16, Huaxing Road, Zhabei. His father, Liu Fengchang, worked in a clothing store. At around 8 PM on the 16th of this month, Yongyuan was at Nanjing Xiangfen Lane, intending to cross the road from north to south. At that moment, it suddenly started raining heavily, and the road became very slippery. As he stepped onto the tram tracks, he slipped and fell. At that moment, Tram No. 34, with the character 皮, was traveling west. The driver, Cui Wenjin, saw Liu but could not brake in time and ran him over, causing severe injuries. His intestines spilled out, and blood flowed like a fountain, a gruesome sight. The patrolmen who arrived at the scene immediately reported the incident to the Zhabei Police Station. The police ordered an ambulance to take him to Renji Hospital, but he died shortly after. The body was taken to the forensic examination office on Fielun Road. Yesterday morning, the First Special District Local Court commissioned Prosecutor Guo Wei to conduct an autopsy. Cui Wenjin testified that he had been driving trams for three years and was not driving fast at the time and that he had rung the bell. He added that he saw the deceased fall on the tracks, so it was too late to stop, resulting in the accident. A witness, Austrian national Pirigripi, testified that on that day, he was sitting in the tram and saw a Chinese person covering their face and walking across the road about five yards away from the car. But that he did not see whether he was hit by the car or slipped. According to the statement of the deceased's father, Liu Feng, Mr. Guo determined that Liu Yongyuan died from abdominal injuries sustained after being hit by Tram No. 34. The body was released to his father, Liu Fengchang, for burial.</p>

<h3 id="e144">The Hai Su Series to be Published Successively <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>To popularize art among the masses, the China Book Company specially invited Mr. Liu Haisu, a leading figure in China's emerging art scene, to compile the "Hai Su Series" in the seventeenth year [of the Republic, i.e. 1928]. It contains masterpieces by famous artists from various countries and eras, as well as representative works by Mr. Liu himself, with systematic commentary. Mr. Liu extensively collected materials and painstakingly wrote, spending two years to complete the manuscript. The series consists of three parts, totaling six volumes and 300,000 words, with 700 illustrations. The first part is the Western Painting Collection, the second part is the National Painting Collection, and the third part is Haisu's National Paintings and Haisu's Western Paintings. The printing process took three years, and any slight blurring would be deleted by Mr. Liu and re-engraved, making it exquisite and unparalleled in the country. The Western Painting Collection has been widely sold since its publication last year, especially to art galleries, which have praised it highly. Newspapers have also repeatedly praised it, making it an immortal masterpiece in China's art world. The Western Painting Collection is divided into two volumes, focusing on modern art and tracing the general source and flow of modern art. Therefore, it starts with the Renaissance, the general source of modern art, and continues to the 20th century. The table of contents for the first volume includes: (1) The Phenomenon and Trends of the Rapid Development of Modern Painting, (2) Painting of the Early Renaissance, (3) Great Talents of the Renaissance, (4) Various French Painting Schools After the Renaissance, (5) Constable, (6) Corot. The table of contents for the second volume includes: (1) Impressionist Painting, (2) Post-Impressionism, further divided into (1) Introduction, (2) David – Pioneer of Post-Impressionism, (3) Cézanne – Father of Emerging Art, (4) The Life of Cézanne, (5) Van Gogh – Mad Genius, (6) Gauguin – Creator of Primitive Style, (7) Gauguin and Cézanne, (8) Matisse – Fierce General of Fauvism, (9) Cubism, (10) Expressionism, (11) Futurism, (12) Vries, etc. Mr. Liu uses a lively and vivid style to describe the artistic trends of various eras and the lives and works of the great masters, paying more attention to interesting anecdotes, which is different from the nature of general art history. Chinese art scholars lack both art museums for observation and accurate reproductions. The book's illustrations and text complement each other, with particularly rich publications on modern masterpieces, allowing general scholars to pursue the path of true art and increasing the appreciation of art lovers. The full set is priced at 20 yuan, with a special price of 15 yuan. For the purpose of popularizing purchases, a further 10% discount will be offered until February. Art lovers and art collectors should seize this opportunity to purchase a copy. It is heard that the second part, the National Painting Collection, and the third part, Haisu's National Paintings and Western Paintings, will also be published successively soon.</p>

<p>The Ferocity of Police Officer Li Zhang: First Killing the Patrol Chief and His Wife, Then Committing Suicide</p>
<h3 id="e146">Li Zhang Used Opium, Secretly Reported by Patrol Chief, Causing Li to Fear Punishment and Commit This Heinous Act <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>Li Zhang, a 38-year-old police officer from Hefei at the Hongqiao Town Police Station of the Sixth District, First Precinct of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, was addicted to opium. This was recently discovered by Patrol Chief Chen Hai (age 36, also from Hefei), who secretly reported it to the station chief. However, this information was leaked to the police officer, who feared punishment from his superiors. A malicious thought arose, and he hid a handgun. Yesterday at around 2 PM, he went to the police station and shot Patrol Chief Chen to death. He then ran to Chen's home at No. 3, Lane 25 in the town and killed Chen's wife. Simultaneously, the officer used his gun to commit suicide. By the time the station chief arrived with a police squad, the murderous officer was on the verge of death. He was immediately taken by car to the Shanghai Sanatorium on Rue Mère-Mathilde. His injuries are said to be severe, and his chances of survival are slim. The bodies of the deceased Patrol Chief Chen and his wife have been reported to the court and will be examined this morning.</p>
<p>Circumstances of the Sinking of the Jinshunxing Sailing Ship</p>
<h3 id="e147">All Eight Crew Members Rescued, Cargo and Ship Sunk in the River, Responsibility for the Accident to be Determined Today <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>The large sailboat Jinshunxing of the Wusong Penglai Sailing Ship Guild collided with the Guangxiang Steamer near Baoshan on the 16th and sank. The sailors were rescued, but the cargo and ship were lost. The Maritime Affairs Bureau is investigating the incident today. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Report to the Harbor Master: The Dada Steamship Company yesterday reported to the Jianghai Customs Harbor Master, stating that according to a report from Fang Xinli, the owner of the Guangxiang, the ship sailed from Tongzhou to Shanghai on the 16th of this month at 4:30 AM. At 10:48 AM, the ship passed the Lianghe Tunnel. The ship was traveling southeast with the current. At 11:15 AM, they saw a sailboat (the Jinshunxing) ahead, bearing about 12 degrees to the ship's starboard side, heading straight northwest. If the sailboat had not changed direction and continued on that course, a collision would not have occurred. However, two minutes later, they saw the sailboat suddenly turn north and move sideways. The ship sounded two blasts of the horn as a warning, but the sailboat ignored it. To prevent danger, the ship sounded the horn again and steered east to give way. However, the sailboat sailed sideways with full sails, intending to pass in front of the ship, but instead collided with the ship's starboard side, breaking two holes in the iron plate of the front hatch. The sailboat's bow was damaged, and it began to take on water and sink. The ship stopped to provide assistance, and the eight crew members of the sailboat lowered a sampan, unloaded their luggage, and boarded the ship for about ten minutes before the sailboat sank. The ship brought the sampan and the eight crew members to Shanghai. They arrived at the port at 2 PM. This is the truth of the sailboat colliding with the ship. The report to the Maritime Affairs Bureau is the same.</p>
<p>Lost Cargo: Yao Shunlai, the owner of the Jinshunxing, was also brought to Shanghai by the Guangxiang. He stated that all eight crew members were unharmed and did not fall into the water. They immediately boarded the sampan, so there were no injuries. The sailboat was carrying 1,280 bags of crude salt, each weighing over 50 catties, from Daishan to be unloaded in Liuhe. The Jinshunxing was a large two-sail sailboat. After the collision, it sank, and all the cargo was lost, but the crew members and their personal belongings were retrieved. There were no drownings or falls into the water. Yesterday, Yao Shunlai and the crew members returned to Wusong to report to the Sailing Ship Guild.</p>
<p>Ship Inspection Today: After receiving the report, Director Zhu of the Maritime Affairs Bureau initially planned to send technicians for inspection yesterday. However, due to the Guangxiang's schedule, it sailed to Tongzhou and is expected to return to Shanghai today. The Maritime Affairs Bureau has rescheduled the inspection to take place at noon today. Yang Qijue was specially dispatched to Shanghai by the Wusong Penglai Sailing Ship Guild yesterday to negotiate with the Dada Company. The Dada Company explained the cause of the accident, proving that the Jinshunxing sailed sideways and collided with the Guangxiang, causing it to sink. Therefore, the fault lies with the sailboat. Upon hearing this, Yang had no choice but to wait for the Maritime Affairs Bureau's investigation to determine the responsibility.</p>

<p>Yesterday was the seventh day of the National Art Exhibition. Because it was Saturday, the number of visitors was extremely crowded. Many of the works of famous artists have already been sold out. There are still those who have pre-ordered works by Wang Yiting, Yu Youren, Cai Yuanpei, Ma Xiangbo, and others. It is said that the association has agreed to ask these artists to contribute more works to satisfy the visitors. The portrait-cutting artist Wan Fanming, who has been rumored for a long time, was finally able to spare time to come to the exhibition today. The portraits he cuts are all lifelike, and the audience is scrambling to get them. However, due to the limited number of portraits, they were all quickly booked. Those who came later could only sigh in despair. It is now heard that Mr. Wan has agreed to spare time tomorrow (the 19th) starting at 1 PM to cut another hundred portraits. No more portraits will be cut after the quota is filled. Those who want to see Mr. Wan's unique skills and want to keep a souvenir should book as soon as possible. Yesterday, the association also received Zhao Qianli's painting of the portraits of Sun Wu and Sun Bin, grandfather and grandson, with inscriptions by Yue Fei, Zhu Zixiang, and famous artists from the Song, Yuan, and Ming dynasties, which is truly a rare treasure. The photography department of the association is composed of famous artists such as Lang Jingshan, and the prices have been reduced to thank the guests. Today is Sunday, and the association anticipates that the number of visitors will be even more crowded, so it has added six students from Chinese middle schools to assist in all matters.</p>

<p>To the esteemed Editor, Greetings. In the local news section of your esteemed newspaper on the 9th of this month, I read about my alleged involvement in gambling and profiting from it in Zhenru, which is completely inconsistent with the facts. I inherited the Shunxing firm in Xinzha from my ancestors and have always been law-abiding. That day, the 13th of the lunar calendar, I was invited by my relative Zhou Fengshan to attend a wedding feast and visited Zhang on the way, leading to a misunderstanding. The ringleader of the gambling has already been detained by the court, which are the facts. My reputation is at stake, so I am writing this letter to correct the record and protect my reputation. I would be grateful if you could publish it in the letter to the editor section to clarify the truth. With best wishes, Yang Miaogen.</p>

<h3 id="e162">Charity <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>丨Letter from Mr. Liu Wenjun丨</p>
<p>The rapidly advancing wheel of the world is trapped in the flood of unemployment. The wheel continues to advance, but the flood of unemployment flows like a waterfall! This is a major problem, and people should be concerned as if facing a great disaster, although it is something that no one can solve immediately. A major eruption and destruction are imminent. Not only have the planes and guns of the Japanese shattered people's illusions, but also the current crisis should awaken people!</p>
<p>Shanghai is a vibrant and ever-changing society, and also the place where the waterfall flows most rapidly. We can no longer blindly believe that the vitality of a prosperous city will revitalize people's flowers, nor should we dream of unattainable aspirations! To understand society, one must look into the depths and dark corners of society! It is in these depths and dark corners that the greatest force pushing the wheel of history is hidden!</p>
<p>These depths and dark corners are filled with the unemployed. Sir, let us look at our suffering compatriots and whether they are being saved. In southern Shanghai, there are several shelters set up during the winter, organized by charitable groups. These are certainly places for our suffering compatriots to seek refuge from the cold. The shelters are overcrowded with ordinary people, and many staff members wear forgiving faces to bestow happiness on the charitable donors. Whether they can wholeheartedly fulfill their mission, I will not say here, but the whips they use to drive the common people are often in their hands. They summon common people last year and dismiss common people this year, although the arrival and departure are equally freezing. (It is said that the cold shelters will be disbanded during this freezing time, or have already been disbanded.) Now, with the spring snow falling and the cold air no less than in the severe winter, we can once again see our suffering compatriots on the streets and in the alleys!</p>
<p>Sir, a small number of people in society enjoy not working, while the majority of the people become refugees. Fortunately, they can still rely on the blessings of the "rich people" to be slightly sheltered from the cold. However, "the arrival and departure are equally freezing." I truly do not understand why the charitable donors, who are also rich people, must make us, this group of suffering compatriots, experience the cruel coldness of heavy snowfall! The rich show mercy to the poor, and the poor should have what kind of gratitude, but the heavy snow when leaving the shelter chills their enthusiasm for gratitude!</p>
<p>I want to ask the following of you, sir: "The current environment will have a major destruction, and the unemployed are at the center of it, and the problem of unemployment will only be solved after the destruction. Charity is merely a palliative." Is my guess and prediction correct? What are your views on the unemployment problem? And what are your comments on the attitude of today's charitable donors? These are the answers I seek!</p>
<p>The unemployment problem is the prerequisite for all problems, and the charity problem is the product of the unemployment problem. These are all important, so please express your opinions!</p>
<p>Answer: The question you raise is very important and can be said to be the most central issue in today's society. I offer the following reply based on my observations: 1. Unemployment is a common phenomenon in today's society, and it is also the inevitable result of today's society, i.e., capitalist society. This problem is certainly very serious in China, but it is equally serious in Europe and America. As you say in your letter, "The current environment will have a major destruction... The problem of unemployment will only be solved after the destruction." However, this destruction is only the destruction of a small number of people, namely the old system, the old organization, the destruction of people who simply enjoy not working. 2. Our attitude toward charitable organizations is the same as yours, because charitable organizations, at their highest evaluation, are nothing more than a head-fixing-headache, foot-fixing-foot ache solution. Honestly, when people are unemployed, have no work, no food, no clothes, and watch their wives and children "weep with hunger and cry with cold," then they become thieves and bandits. What other way can they go? However, we are equally opposed to it. Why? Because this action cannot solve the fundamental problem of this social phenomenon, and it makes the general poor "hooligans." As a result, they lose their revolutionary spirit and instead become a major obstacle to the future, because their lives become romanticized and they develop the mentality of "drink today, forget tomorrow." The phenomenon in Shanghai is very obvious. You said, "Charitable organizations are the product of the unemployment problem," which is correct; however, if you say, "The unemployment problem is the prerequisite for all problems," then there is room for discussion. Because to solve the unemployment problem, one cannot simply think about the unemployment problem itself, that is, the eyes of the unemployed masses cannot only focus on the economic struggle, but must also focus on the improvement of politics.</p>
<p>In the article "Sympathy for Mr. Ren Wangtong's Views on Suicide" in this column on the 17th, the phrase "cannot achieve success" is missing after "extremely solid fighting organization" in the thirty-ninth line. This is hereby corrected.</p>

<p>Finally recovered by 4.6 taels with a difference of 11.1 taels</p>
<p>Gold prices fell after the passage of the US silver purchase proposal.</p>
<p>Guangdong merchants vigorously covered their short positions before closing, rapidly raising prices.</p>
<h3 id="e164">Summary <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>The gold market, which fell the day before due to the emergence of Guangdong merchants, suddenly rebounded sharply yesterday with vigorous covering. The market situation was extremely chaotic. The morning opening was due to foreign telegrams reporting that London silver bars had risen by 125 points for both spot and forward prices, and New York silver prices had risen by 25 points. The forward silver price was also up by a large 1.6 cents. Both British and American exchange rates saw increases, and American cotton also rose by several points. Although the silver market rose across the board, the increase was not significant. Bank private telegrams only showed an increase of 125 points, so the opening was flat at 776.5 taels. It once reached 7.6 taels after opening, but later, due to foreign telegrams reporting that the US Monetary Committee subcommittee had passed the silver purchase proposal, the exchange rate loosened sharply, and the gold price fell to 771.2 taels. After entering, it gradually rebounded. Finally, Guangdong merchants vigorously covered their previously sold bars in goods, and the gold price was raised. Yifengyong also purchased more than a thousand bars on behalf of the market, breaking through 80 taels. The exchange rate was also good. Hengxing came up and made further advances several times, rising to 782.3 taels, which, compared with the lowest price, had already rebounded by 11.1 taels, which was truly unexpected. The general retail shorts also hurriedly covered their positions, with much complaining. Although the spot price was increased to 19 taels, there were few transactions. The swap trade was even more stagnant. Although it was only a half-day market, the rebound was quite surprising, and the trend was extremely difficult to grasp. The industry also lacked a clear will. Banks had a good appetite, and their entry and exit were also active, so hedging was extremely active. Gold market transactions were not small, unlike the previous silence. The trend is not yet very good, and we will see how the overseas silver market fares today. Now, the half-day market situation is recorded as follows.</p>

When Richang goods came to sell, it was 6 taels, and Yifengyong sold, and it was 5 taels. Reuters telegrams also came about silver news, and immediately retreated to 4 taels, but this telegram was not fully reported, and the result of the omission was still unknown, so it was still able to improve by one tael.

<h3 id="e174">Critical Period, Cautious Long and Short Positions, New Public Bond Trading Gradually Decreasing <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>Fluctuations Resulting in a Drop of Thirty to Eighty Cents</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange and the public bond market appeared quite stable on the surface, but the trend was gradually downward. With no significant changes in the diplomatic situation, long and short positions gradually reached a stalemate. Except for the active forward trading, new trades became increasingly scarce. The fluctuating trend remained unchanged. In the morning's initial trading session, retail investors sold off, dropping slightly by thirty to fifty cents. In the second session, No. 5 bought several hundred thousand, rebounding slightly by thirty to forty cents. In the afternoon's initial trading session, Nos. 11 and 21 made slight purchases, rising another thirty to forty cents. At closing, sales of Nos. 34 and 40 surged, and market prices could not stabilize. Each bond gradually weakened slightly, some by twenty to thirty cents, others by seventy to eighty cents. As a result, prices fell again by thirty to eighty cents. Among them, spot salt tax and spot whole sixes, due to prolonged inactivity, fell by more than one or two yuan. These accumulated gains and losses have exceeded their time sensitivity and are insufficient to determine the day's trend. Currently, the Sino-Japanese problem has evolved from complexity to simplicity. Whether to fight or not depends on Japan's repentance. At this critical juncture of rising and falling, speculators inevitably hesitate, so market prices fluctuate uncertainly. The total transaction volume for the entire day was 6,762,000 yuan, including 1,000 yuan each for spot salt tax and spot whole sixes. Forward salt tax accounted for about 2.5 million yuan, demobilization bonds for over 1.1 million yuan, and various other bonds ranged from tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands.</p>

<p>The Sin Fung Foreign Firm reported that on Friday (the 17th), the New York stock market improved. The original improvement was due to the Senate passing the repeal of prohibition, positive commercial news, the Michigan turmoil gradually calming down, firming commodities, and repeated declarations from powerful parties that there would be no liquidation risk for railroads when debts mature on March 1. However, trading was thin. The total trading volume for the entire day was 660,000 shares. The closing prices of several stocks are recorded below (in gold dollars): American Foreign Power 7% Preferred Stock 111, American Water Works &amp; Electric 14, B&amp;O Railroad 105, Canadian Pacific Railway 9.75, Curtiss-Wright Airplane 11, Electric Bond and Share 14.5, Fox Film 5, International Telephone &amp; Telegraph 6.25, Loew's (Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer) 15, Packard Motor Car 2.25, Radio Corporation of America 4, Standard Oil of New Jersey 6.75, Standard Gas &amp; Electric 10.

<p>After a sharp decline, the yarn market situation eased somewhat. As general profit-takers seized the opportunity to cover short positions, market sentiment became tighter. At the same time, Yunnan and inland buyers with actual demand made purchases, stabilizing sentiment. However, the situation remained severe, and overseas cotton markets were also weak and lifeless. From a broader perspective, the future of the yarn market was still difficult to be very optimistic about because the economic situation on all sides was ultimately too bleak, and purchasing power was bound to be weak.</p>

Prices for all months rose by two, four, and six cents. In the afternoon, market sentiment was flat, with prices for all months falling slightly by one to three cents. The total trading volume for the day was 21,000 bales. Dafeng sold 1,700 bales, Suilong 650 bales, Lichang 1,700 bales, Hengchang 650 bales, Xinhua 700 bales, and Taichang 800 bales.

<p>Spot yarn trading was slightly active. According to statistics, various trading houses bought a total of 1,243 bales throughout the day. Market conditions were flat. The amounts bought by each trading house are listed below:</p>

<p>Shantou 300 Ningbo 20 Inland 423 Changsha 35</p>
<p>The cotton market rose again, but the overseas cotton market remained in a fluctuating pattern. Some local traders were psychologically bullish, and the number of buyers increased daily. Their intention was to say that if the situation becomes serious, foreign cotton coming to Shanghai would require war risk insurance, raising prices, which would create a strong pull. However, the current domestic financial decline and the sluggish yarn market meant there were also many people selling short, given that last year's tagged yarn price reached 138.3 taels and the lowest cotton price was 27 taels.</p>

<p>The Zheng futures market opened flat. Prices suddenly rose in the second and third trading sessions due to retail investors covering short positions, with prices for all months rising by one, three, and four cents. The market fell by one cent after the afternoon opening, but rebounded in the second and third sessions, resulting in a flat close. The total trading volume for the day was 54,900 dan.

Egyptian cotton spot prices fell by two points.

<p>A New York telegram on the 17th reported on the cotton market situation for the week, stating, "The raw cotton market was loose this week, due to liquidation and sales by cooperative brokers, the Michigan bank's suspension of cash payments for eight days, and news of the closure of several small banks elsewhere. All of these events have created a disturbing force. In addition, the decrease in demand for cotton goods is also a reason for the loosening of the market. However, the decline in raw cotton prices has been resisted by industry buying around the six-cent per pound price for June futures. Market conditions have recently stabilized, and purchases are now waiting for the development of market conditions. The recent temperature in the cotton belt can be considered low enough to reduce dormant boll weevils. Reports from various locations still indicate an increase in cotton fields. The domestic agricultural relief bill has been passed by the Senate Agriculture Committee, but oversight is limited to those who grow wheat and cotton, and restrictions on farmland and production have been removed, making effective monitoring difficult. According to private sources in Washington, the Smith case has a better chance of passing, but some parties still doubt whether the case will pass."</p>

<h3 id="e184">Rice Prices in Hexia Up Ten Cents <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, arrivals were numbered twenty-five and twenty-six. Sales were piecemeal, with slight activity among urban and rural shop customers. Wholesalers remained cautious, with only traders going to warehouses to buy five to six hundred shih. Accumulated inventory in Pudong was light due to relatively scarce daily arrivals and better outbound flow, so selling parties were generally thinking of making a profit, and the market suddenly turned active. The price of Su Tong-style rice rose by about ten cents. Due to the limited supply of Qingjiao Baoxian rice, the market shape was still good despite weak wholesale demand. Nanhang-style thick and thin rice had balanced arrivals and sales and matched supply and demand, so market prices remained stable. Duyangjian was short of goods, and customers were holding onto them, so the rice was not affected by cheaper customer-pointed rice, and prices rose by about ten cents. The market for counterfeit silver yuan goods was sluggish due to scarce supply and slow sales, and there was no change. As for the five-dou and six-dou municipal measures used in the market, the outside world did not understand the truth and had misunderstandings. Therefore, after consultation among the northern and southern rice merchants, it was decided that only the five-dou municipal measure should be used, and the six-dou measure should be abolished to comply with the laws and regulations for unified measuring instruments.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, forty-one or forty-two boats arrived from Hexia. Sales of white keng rice were slightly improved in this street, with a lack of transactions in the surrounding countryside. Market shape weakened by another ten to twenty cents. Arrivals of thin rice were small and sales were balanced. Price shape was high and stable, with mid-quality rice slightly soft. Arrivals of early rice continued, and sales were relatively slow, with prices slightly lower. Yangbujian and Dujian had balanced arrivals and sales, with prices slightly soft. Customer-pointed rice was stable, counterfeit silver yuan maintained its momentum, and white yuan was weak.</p>
<p>Customer Xian Rice Sells Briskly and the Market is Stable</p>
<h3 id="e185">Rumors of Military Rice Purchases on This Street <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>Sales of customer xian rice were increasingly brisk yesterday. Both this street and Fuzhou trading houses had strong demand, with the total market opening close to 7,000 packages, the highest transaction volume in days. In the morning, Fuzhou trading houses bought 970 packages of Jiangxi late-season milled rice at a price of 8.60 to 8.50 yuan, and 767 packages of Hunan red rough rice at a price of 6.70 yuan. This street bought 476 packages of Hunan milled red rice at a price of 8.10 yuan, and 1,000 packages of Jiangxi late-season milled rice at a price of 8.73 to 8.55 yuan. Market conditions and prices gradually stabilized. At the afternoon opening, Fuzhou trading houses bought even more actively, continuing to purchase 533 packages of Hunan red rough rice at the same price of 6.70 yuan. This street had even stronger afternoon demand, purchasing over 2,000 packages of Jiangxi late-season rice at a price of 8.73 yuan, followed by 8.40 yuan, and over 900 packages of Hunan milled oil rice at a price of 8.40 to 8.50 yuan. It was said that the goods purchased by this street were procured on behalf of military needs by a certain firm in the South City, so the market situation at the close became even more stable.</p>
<h3 id="e186">Flour and Wheat Markets Show Tighter Conditions <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>(Tagged Flour) Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning, the prices for each month suddenly surged. Although there was no change in the quoted prices for foreign wheat, rumors of suspended Australian wheat shipments greatly agitated sentiment. In fact, although the situation in the north was tense, international transportation would definitely not be immediately affected. However, sentiment was easily affected, and because the current flour from each factory could be drawn directly according to the standard without additional charges, northern customers all started to draw and buy. The opening price for this month reached a high of 1 tael, 8 qian, 1 fen, and 5 li, which was 3 fen higher than the previous day. Prices for forward months also rose by one or two fen each. By the time the market opened in the afternoon, the tension remained at first, but then slightly subsided because Fufeng and smaller factories still had offers available, and the exchange rate had eased. There was a fear that foreign wheat shipments would continue to be booked, which slightly dampened sentiment. Fufeng and small factories had drawn and set standards for 170,000, and Fuxin had reached 150,000, so the price fluctuations of flour in the near term will depend on the drawing and loading situation in the later stages. As a result, this month's price rose by 2.5 fen compared to the previous day, March's price rose by 2 fen, April's price rose by 2 fen and 2 li and 5 hao, May's price rose by 7 li and 5 hao, and June and July's prices rose by 1.5 fen.</p>
<p>(Wheat Futures) Yesterday, after the opening of the wheat market in the morning and afternoon, the prices for each month showed an initial flat and then tighter trend. In the morning sessions, prices were flat because there was not much fluctuation in foreign wheat. However, the opening price for this month was as high as 2 fen, and forward months also rose slightly. By the time the market opened in the afternoon, the opening prices for each month were generally stable. Because most of the buyers were not in the industry, they were more inclined to wait and see at this stage, so even though the traders had a surplus of hedging, they were unwilling to offer more due to the situation, resulting in a stalemate. As a result, this month's price did not move compared to the previous day, March's price rose by 2 fen, April's price rose by 3 fen, and July's price rose by 2 fen.</p>
<p>There was no comparison for the remaining months.</p>
<p>Also, a telegram on the 17th stated that Chicago wheat was weak due to short covering and better export demand. The previous day's transaction volume was 10 million bushels. The market prices are listed on the left:</p>
<p>Closing Price Compared to Previous Day</p>
<p>May Futures 47.75 Up 0.125</p>
<p>July Futures 48.375 Up 0.125</p>

<h3 id="e187">Gradual Progress in the Soybean and Soybean Cake Market <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the soybean market temporarily remained in a fluctuating pattern. Factories slightly resumed purchases, with a total of seven train cars of soybeans traded. Market shape showed a continued weakness in the Dalian market, so sentiment was uneasy. However, both arrivals and inventories were scarce, and soybean cake sales had begun, so the future of the soybean market gradually had hope of stabilizing. Soybean cake factories were still selling at reduced prices. Yesterday's transactions were goods returned by traders, so the market was slightly soft, but factory prices still needed to be in the range of 1 tael, 3 qian, and 6 fen. Guang trading houses bought 500 to 600 packages of red beans. Because goods were scarce, the market remained stable. The oil market showed a lively trend yesterday, and the market situation was also stable.</p>
<p>Sugar Market</p>
<h3 id="e188">Another Batch of Domestic Mianhu White Sugar Arrives <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market's guild allocated a market price of 15.6 taels for No. 24 coarse sand white sugar, and only 100 bags were traded, probably because today was Sunday and there was no outgoing cargo from sellers. Both No. 20 medium sand white sugar and No. 890 Dutch red sugar were only quoted and not allocated, and the transaction was unusually light. Jianbing Da Laihua continued to open 35 boxes of Five Fortunes white crystal sugar at a price of 13 taels per cu, and the market momentum was firm. Although traders hoped to slightly reduce prices, the stock was thin, and they ultimately could not fulfill their wishes. Chao trading houses arrived with another 76 pieces of Mianhu white sugar, and it was said that the goods were better than before, and there might be a price increase. In addition, both Diaoqing and Chaoqing had no intention of making deliveries, and they did not continue to open.</p>
<p>North-South Goods</p>
<h3 id="e189">Black Fungus Opens Up Four Taels <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>Market Prices Rise Two to Three Taels</p>
<p>Black fungus has been scarce recently, and customer demand has been extremely tight. For example, Malanping fungus opened at 62.5 taels, and Sichuan fungus opened at 62 taels, up four taels before and after. However, on the sales side, Guangzhou trading houses were still in dispute due to the new scale relationship, and only Fujian Quanzhou and Xinghua trading houses had slight transactions, so market prices could not fully rise. Yesterday, the market price for miscellaneous fungus was 58 taels, and some were quoted at 60 taels, also up two to three taels from before, with a very tight trend.</p>
<p>Silk and Tea</p>
<h3 id="e190">The Artificial Silk Market Continues to Weaken <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>Only Over 300 Pieces of Chinese Silk Shipped to the United States</p>
<p>After the news of the drop in Japanese artificial silk prices was confirmed, the Shanghai European and American artificial silk markets were sluggish, and the exchange rate was tense, further weakening prices. Inland silk merchants were all watching the futures and spot silk markets. The market atmosphere was clear and weak. Yesterday, only Sichuan trading houses continued to buy 36 boxes of Grade B artificial silk for February and March at the guild. Prices continued to fall by five to seven qian and five hao.</p>
<p>Also, the sales of Chinese silk to the United States have not improved, and it is difficult to turn around exports. Yesterday, the American mail ship Jackson departed from Shanghai for the United States. Qianli and others only had 324 pieces of yellow, white, and gray silk loaded to New York and San Francisco.</p>
<p>Oil Market</p>
<h3 id="e191">The Momentum of Asphalt Price Increases is a Thing of the Past <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>In the past two weeks, the asphalt market has been quite strong. Hubei oil has risen by about five taels, and Zhejiang oil has risen by seven or eight yuan. However, because the goods that Hubei city pre-sold have not been delivered for a long time, and the source of goods has been extremely scarce, it has been necessary to temporarily stop spot trading and wait for the sold goods to be delivered before discussing transactions. The market has been quiet for a week. It is reported that what has arrived in recent days, in addition to delivering previously sold goods, still has no remaining inventory, so the price increase or decrease in the later stage is still unknown. However, because the momentum of Zhejiang oil price increases has been too strong, although it is not in danger, there are more sellers and fewer buyers who are watching, and the situation seems to be slightly weak. However, because the production area in the upper Yangtze River had a poor harvest year, and the amount of production has been greatly reduced, although there has been an arrival of goods in the market after the recent price increase, it is not as prosperous as in previous years. Also, the inventory of Hangzhou trading houses is thin, so even if the market is weak, the position is still solid, and sellers are really unwilling to sell at too low a price. Based on the current market, it is only a large price increase and a small loosening. Local traders and candle factories have no inventory, and very few goods arrive. Sales are not very smooth because candle makers are preparing for summer production early and are waiting and seeing. Also, since traders have no goods in hand, they are also unwilling to let the price increase too much. Currently, the asking price for heavy Jing is 23 taels, the asking price for flat Jing is 22 taels, 2 qian, and 4 fen, the asking price for high-quality Macheng goods is 22 taels, and the asking price for small Chao goods is 21 taels, 7 qian, and 8 fen. However, as far as previous years are concerned, soap factories are in the middle of needing goods, but it has not been heard that any has been purchased. If soap sales move, then the market should be discussed separately.</p>
<p>Hardware</p>
<h3 id="e192">Two Hundred Tons of Black Iron Sheet is Set <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, hardware transactions felt lively. Trading houses from Tianjin, Qingdao, Yantai, and various trading houses along the Yangtze River made purchases, so the transaction volume was still considerable. However, the goods purchased were mostly sporadic, so the market situation was even more complicated. Among them, black iron sheet had the largest volume, so the market goods had a lack of continuity. The standard skyrocketed, and the market price could be estimated at 9 taels and 5 qian per dan, while the thick variegated goods could also be opened at 8 taels and 7 qian and 5 hao per dan, but the market goods were extremely scarce. In order to prevent future shortages, traders all contracted forward goods with foreign firms. It was heard that 200 tons were contracted yesterday, and the price per ton was 10 pounds, 02 shillings, and 6 pence. It was determined that the contracted party was a certain British trading house. Yesterday, Tianjin and Qingdao trading houses bought over 1,000 boxes of tinplate, and the market price had very little fluctuation. Many people purchased British steel plate, but there were few market goods, resulting in few transactions. The market price was 2 li and 5 hao, and the market price per dan was 8 taels and 5 qian, 5 hao. The market price for half a fen was 6 taels and 7 qian and 5 hao, and the market price for 7 li and 5 hao per dan was 6 taels and 5 qian. The market price for one fen was 6 taels and 2 qian and 5 hao, which were all up from before. There were very few thick variegated goods offered, and the rest were around 6 taels per dan. Although the Yangtze River trading houses slightly purchased black iron nails and new galvanized wire, there were very few transactions, so the market price had very little change. In addition to inquiries, there was very little activity with new silver yuan angle iron, I-beam iron, galvanized iron tiles, etc., but due to good sentiment, there was no downward trend in prices. In addition, there were very few transactions in each market yesterday, and there was not much price increase or decrease.</p>

<h3 id="e218">Philosophy of Flying Birds <a href="#e218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>— Fan Zhongyun</p>
<p>Having been separated from Elder Fuyuan for several years, I recently had the chance to meet him on the streets of Shanghai. During the banquet, he was still drinking one sip at a time, and still joking in a calm and unhurried manner.</p>
<p>Recalling the gatherings of several years ago, it is truly nostalgic.</p>
<p>My deepest impression of Elder Fuyuan is his so-called philosophy of flying birds. But this is not the thought of an idealistic poet, but his view of women. He didn't originally have this name; I gave it to him. At that time, he was the chief editor of the "Contribution Ten-Day Magazine" in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Elder Fuyuan believes that women are like flying birds and should be allowed to fly freely among the branches and forests. If they are captured and confined in a cage, then although they may jump lightly and lively, and sing clearly and loudly, they inevitably lack vitality. Moreover, because they are imprisoned in a cage, they often make a mess of feces, staining clothes, becoming a great eyesore. Therefore, women are always more lively and charming on the street than at home, worthy of people's love. The reason why other people's wives are good is this, because we often meet them when they can fly relatively freely.</p>
<p>From the perspective of general feminists, this view is of course an insult to women. But in fact, it is not. This is precisely the harsh reality. Because until today, the existence of women in society is still just a bird; she is a plaything of men. The iron fetters of economics, in the form of marriage and family, bind her, making her unable to be free. Birds can still break through the cage and forage in the forest, but women can absolutely not open the nets of men. Career women are considered liberated, but they still inevitably use sex as a means of livelihood. School education should be able to break this bad habit, but in the end, it is still education for playthings or decorations, education for marriage and career. Why must company female clerks use appearance as a screening standard? Why must ministers and important people seek spouses from the universities they lead? And even why must female bachelors choose to marry gilded or silver young masters? Once we understand these things, we can reflect on ourselves more than halfway.</p>
<p>In short, true freedom must remove economic shackles. Otherwise, love is inevitably tainted with the smell of money, and marriage is simply a long-term profession of prostitution. Birds have two wings and the ability to fly. When birds become aware of these constraints, the realm of freedom may not be far away.</p>
<p>Remembering Elder Fuyuan, I wrote this the day after he left Shanghai as a memorial. And I wish him success in the educational cause of transforming society.</p>
<h3 id="e219">Speaking the Truth <a href="#e219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Menglin</p>
<p>People all know that Xiao Bonai is a comedian, saying that he is good at telling jokes. Xiao Bonai said, "I am telling the truth; the biggest joke in the world is telling the truth."</p>
<p>Speaking the truth 丨丨 this is Old Mr. Xiao's slogan that he has shouted loudly for fifty years. His essays, his novels, and his plays all center on this mission. For decades, he has tirelessly pointed out to us those heroes who tell lies to cover up their actions, the middle class who tell lies, the proletariat who tell lies, women who tell lies, governments who tell lies, etc. He exposes the comical nature of their inconsistency between words and deeds, calling on us to see that this is modern civilization.</p>
<p>The more selfish and self-interested people are, the more righteous and grand-sounding reasons they can come up with. The more corrupt and lawless officials are, the more they will talk about protecting human rights; the more pleasure-seeking modern men and women are, the more they will talk about dancing to save the country, and so on. So we often see many arguments in newspapers, advising these people to do what they say. Xiao Bonai said that these are idealists 丨丨 idealists who dare not face reality directly. People who are inconsistent in word and deed are because they dare not face the real reasons for their actions, so they think of a false, righteous, and grand-sounding reason to replace it. Similarly, those who advise them to do what they say are also concealing reality, ideally thinking that they can act as nobly as they say. Realists know that this is not the case at all. People are still in the process of evolution and cannot be perfect. These noble morals that they talk about are still out of reach. Therefore, human selfishness, greed, and pleasure-seeking are, of course, to be expected. But if we can face this reality directly, we can still come up with ways to improve. Humans are still constantly evolving forward. Therefore, Xiao Bonai's proposition is that people can act in any way they want, according to their instincts, but what they must not do is think one thing and do another 丨丨丨 speak the truth! What he asks of us is not to make our actions match our words, but to make our words match our actions. In this, Xiao Bonai has turned our inherited thoughts upside down again. He often plays this trick.</p>
<p>Then, according to Xiao Bonai's proposition, wouldn't good and evil be indistinguishable? Old Mr. Xiao answers this question from the idealist in "Major Barbara": "Good and evil! You think you can distinguish between good and evil after living so many years? Humph! What is good, what is evil? From Confucius to Socrates, for thousands of years, countless intelligent people have racked their brains, and they still can't come to a result. Do you think you can?"</p>
<p>So people can only do what their instincts dictate. Face the motives for why you do this. When you instinctively feel that this behavior is wrong, you will think of ways to change it. If you only use excuses to cover up this reality, you will never change in this lifetime, and you will not evolve into a higher animal in this lifetime. Then, there will be higher animals than you (what Old Mr. Xiao calls supermen) who will appear and treat you with the same methods you use to treat monkeys.</p>
<p>Xiao Bonai says that humans are indeed the highest animals now. However, biological evolution does not stop with humans, and therefore there is no reason why humans must be preserved. Why can't animals higher than you use the same methods to treat you as you treat other lower animals?</p>
<p>It is said that a year or two ago, an editor of a large magazine traveled thousands of miles to ask Old Mr. Xiao a question, believing that Xiao Bonai's answer to this question would definitely be of great interest to the world. His question was, in Xiao Bonai's opinion, who is the most precious person in modern times, the one who is most indispensable to culture and progress. He asked,</p>
<p>"If humanity suddenly suffered the fate of total destruction, and you, Old Sir, like Noah in Genesis, could use your power to leave a little of the human race, then who would you leave behind?"</p>
<p>Old Mr. Xiao answered with a mysterious smile:</p>
<p>"I wouldn't leave anyone behind."</p>
<p>Xiao Bonai is very pessimistic about modern humans but has great hope for biological evolution.</p>
<p>Now he has come to China, unfortunately at a time when imperialist Japan is invading us. This reminds us of his attitude during the European War. At that time, someone in England said of him, "The Allied Powers are fighting Germany on one hand and Xiao Bonai on the other." When the entire British people were denouncing the Germans, he unexpectedly denounced the British government. If this were in China, he would have been executed long ago.</p>
<p>His attitude at the time can be seen in the play "Heartbreak House." War is the result of modern civilization. Those affected by modern civilization are not just one country, but every country; not just one class, but every class. It is all of humanity that has been corrupted by modern civilization. Therefore, while the Germans should be scolded, the British should be scolded even more. When all the British people are scolding others, they forget themselves. Therefore, Old Mr. Xiao had no choice but to come out and tell the truth.</p>
<p>A second war is about to break out again. Perhaps Old Mr. Xiao will have to tell the truth once more! (The End)</p>
<h3 id="e220">The Black Girl's Quest for God (V) <a href="#e220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>— By George Bernard Shaw, translated by Yi Shi</p>
<p>"This is not an argument; it is a mockery," said the black girl. "You seem not to know what an argument is."</p>
<p>"Oh! I am the one whom the whole world acknowledges as having subdued Job; how can I not know what an argument is! I am simply laughing at you, child," said the old gentleman, who was very agitated but also too astonished to fully comprehend the present scene.</p>
<p>"I do not care if you laugh at me," said the black girl; "but you have not yet told me why you did not create a world that is all good instead of a mixture of good and evil. It does not count as an answer to ask me if I could have created it better myself. If I were God, there would be no tsetse flies [note]. My people would not fall ill with sudden diseases, grow terrible tumors, and commit all sorts of sins. Other kinds of snakes are able to live without a venom sac; why did you specifically put a venom sac in the mouth of a mamba?" Why did you make monkeys so ugly and birds so beautiful?"</p>
<p>(Note) A poisonous fly produced in South Africa</p>
<p>"Why should I not do this?" said the old gentleman. "Answer me that."</p>
<p>"Why should you do this? Unless you have a penchant for doing evil," said the black girl.</p>
<p>"Asking difficult questions does not count as arguing," he said. "This does not count as playing the game."</p>
<p>"A God who cannot answer my questions is useless to me," said the black girl. "Moreover, if everything is truly made by you, you should know why you made the whale as fat as it is in the pictures."</p>
<p>"What business is it of yours if I deliberately created him in an amusing shape for my own amusement?" he said. "Who are you to teach me how to make all sorts of things?"</p>
<p>"I am growing tired of you," said the black girl. "You are always in a bad temper. I do not believe you have ever created anything. Job must have been very stupid not to have recognized you. There are too many old men posing as gods in this forest."</p>
<p>She raised "Nob Kali" to strike him; but he nimbly slipped under the table. She felt certain that the table had already sunk into the ground because when she reached the table, there was nothing there. When she went to examine her sacred book again, the wind had seized thirty pages from it and scattered them like dust in the forest.</p>
<p>After this experience, the black girl was clearly troubled. She had not seen God: half of her sacred book was destroyed; she had twice become annoyed without receiving any satisfaction. She began to ask herself: had she placed too much emphasis on the white beard, old age, and pajamas as sacred symbols? It was fortunate that she met a very handsome white boy dressed in Greek clothing and with his head and face smoothly shaven. She had never seen anyone like him before. In particular, the outer corners of his eyebrows were raised and twisted, which she found both interesting and off-putting.</p>
<p>"Excuse me, sir," she said. "You have a pair of intelligent eyes. I am seeking God. Can you guide me?" "Do not trouble yourself so," said the boy. "Let the world be as it is; because there is nothing beyond the world. The end of all roads is the grave, which is the gate of nothingness; in the shadows of nothingness, everything is illusory. Take my advice, do not seek beyond the tip of your nose. You will always know what is beyond this; knowing this, you will be happy and hopeful."</p>
<h3 id="e221">Go Back and Tell Your Mother <a href="#e221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>— Yang Qiu</p>
<p>When Shaw was in Hong Kong, he said to a Reuters reporter: "Why is it that no one in the Chinese press has interviewed me? Are they so young as to not know me?" These two sentences are truly stinging and make us feel uncomfortable! But perhaps our Mr. Shaw has forgotten the lesson that a little girl in the Soviet Union gave him a few years ago. The story is like this:</p>
<p>When Shaw was in the Soviet Union a few years ago, one day, he played with a little girl named ××× for a long time. When they parted, Shaw said to her, "Go back and tell your mother that the one who played with you today was the world-famous George Bernard Shaw." But this little girl was after all too "young," and she didn't recognize who Shaw was. She immediately and without hesitation followed Shaw's tone and said to Shaw, "You also go back and tell your mother that the one who played with you today was ××× girl!"</p>
<p>Shaw hasn't forgotten this story, has he!</p>
<h3 id="e222">Talking About Shaw (Continued) <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>— Lin Yutang</p>
<p>(3) Shaw on Jesus</p>
<p>According to Shaw (preface to "Androcles and the Lion"), Jesus was a revolutionary idealist and the ancestor of communal ownership of wives. Shaw's view, according to Henry, is that the more the world progresses, the more it proves the greatness of Jesus's teachings. According to Shaw's interpretation, Jesus's teachings generally have four points, the second of which is:</p>
<p>"Abolish property and merge it into the public. Your work should be completely detached from remuneration. If you let a child go hungry, you are letting God go hungry. Set aside all concerns about tomorrow's clothing and food, because you cannot serve two masters: God and Mammon." The fourth is: "Abolish the ties of your family. All mothers in the world are like the mother who bore you. All people in the world are like brothers and sisters who share the same womb as you. Do not waste your time on funerals: pay attention to life, not death: fish in the sea are as good as fish on the beach, and even better. The kingdom of heaven is within you, and in the kingdom of heaven, there is no marriage, because you cannot serve two masters in your life: God and the person you marry or marry to."</p>
<p>However, Shaw absolutely rejects the legends that Jesus was Christ, claimed to be the Son of God, and could be resurrected and ascend to heaven. What is even more novel is that he does not believe that Jesus's personality was gentle. He can be said to be kind, loving, humane, tragic, and philosophical, but he cannot be said to be gentle. Shaw said:</p>
<p>"Calling Jesus gentle, humble, and meek is a despicable modern fabrication, which has no basis in the Gospels."</p>
<p>In fact, the great personalities of the East and the West have been misunderstood by petty people. Even our Confucius could ever be gentle, respectful, frugal, and yielding? He resembled Yang Hu, how could he be gentle? He was extravagant on one hand, and on the other hand, he wanted to go to see Gongshan Furao, who rebelled by extravagance; he also deceived the people of Pu into leaving Wei and breaking out of the siege, and after breaking out of the siege, he went to Wei and advocated attacking Pu, how could he be good? It was fine if he didn't see Ru Bei, but he had to pick up the zither and sing, making it difficult for people to be comfortable, how could he be respectful? He lived in thick fox and badger furs, and ate nothing, ate nothing, how could he be frugal? He refused to sell his carriage to bury Yan Hui, how could he be yielding? Therefore, we can only learn from Mencius and say: "However, without me, there would be no you." If we are willing to reread the Analects without wearing glasses, Confucius's personality will naturally come alive on the page.</p>

<p>(Guangzhou Correspondence) The Southwest Education Reform Committee previously resolved to reform the academic system and abolish winter and summer vacations, changing the length of schooling at all levels. After recent research, it was determined that the original reform plan still needed to be revised.

<p>丨Only One-Tenth of Students Applied for Leave Before Vacation</p>
<p>Since the Yuguan Incident, the situation of students in various universities in Beiping escaping from exams to return home or leaving early for vacation, as well as the current state of the schools, has attracted much attention from all sides. The central government has also repeatedly sent letters to the Ministry of Education requesting it to investigate and reply so that it can review and handle the matter. On the 16th, the Ministry of Education again received a letter from the Central Public Guidance Committee requesting it to "strictly order the authorities of various universities in Beiping to severely punish students who are overdue in returning to school." After approving the letter, the Ministry of Education has telegraphed various universities in Beiping to promptly report the situation of the start of school and classes. It is heard that the Ministry of Education will deliberate on the situation of each school after receiving the replies and handle them separately. Now, based on what is known from the investigation, the process of this matter is described in detail below.</p>

<p>The Central Government, based on the petition from Chen Du-xue and others, citizens of Beiping, requesting the suspension of educational funding for national schools in Beiping during class suspensions and the transfer of said funds to military needs for resistance against Japan, had sent a letter to the Ministry of Education for investigation and reply. (The Ministry of Education replied to the Central Secretariat on the 16th, stating, "Regarding this case, the Ministry previously, last month, based on reports in various newspapers about alarms at Yuguan, found that some universities in Beiping had students fleeing exams and leaving school, and classes being dismissed early. Investigations confirmed these events. University students are the backbone of the nation, and it is unacceptable for them to be alarmed and disrupt school regulations, and the school authorities did not report this, which is tantamount to condoning such behavior. Therefore, we have sent a telegram instructing the schools to report truthfully and in detail the circumstances of the students fleeing exams and early dismissal, so that we may investigate and handle the matter, and to also report the start date of the next semester. This is of utmost importance." Due to the foregoing, we are replying accordingly, hoping that you will examine and forward this to the Central Government.)</p>

<p>After the Ministry of Education issued the telegram last month, it received replies from various public and private universities and colleges in Beiping, generally stating that only one-tenth of the students had requested leave due to the Yuguan alarm. All schools followed academic regulations and dismissed classes on February 11th and held semester exams. Some schools that did not have time to hold semester exams will hold make-up exams after the start of the semester from the 1st to the 8th of this month, and classes have now formally resumed one after another. As for whether all students have returned since the start of the semester, no report has yet been submitted to the Ministry. As for the Ministry of Education's punishment for students who requested leave, left school, or arrived late for the start of school, nothing has been heard yet.</p>

<p>The regulations for primary and secondary schools, compiled by the Ministry of Education, have already been reviewed and approved by the ministerial meeting. However, because they are related to various other school regulations, a comprehensive plan had to be considered. After the two regulations for normal schools and vocational schools are reviewed and finalized, the four school regulations will be announced simultaneously. It is rumored that the two regulations for normal schools and vocational schools can be reviewed and finalized at the ministerial meeting next Monday (the 20th), and the four regulations can be promulgated simultaneously within the next week.</p>

<p>The International Cup football tournament has reached a critical juncture. The Chinese team will meet Scotland at Yiyuan this afternoon at 3:00 PM to compete for a spot in the finals. Scotland is one of the strongest teams in this year's International Cup, with Agha as the main force, plus three or four Western catchers. China, on the other hand, has the Donghua team as its base, supplemented by elite troops from Jinan and Youyou. The sharpness of the forwards is unparalleled. Facing Scotland, they should have more than enough. However, we cannot underestimate the enemy. There is another semifinal game, England vs. Italy, at the racecourse, which will be a one-sided affair, predictable. The game will proceed rain or shine.

<p>4-0 Defeat of Agha, Donghua Secures Group A Championship</p>
<h3 id="e244">With Four Games Remaining, No Match for Donghua's Opponents <a href="#e244" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c244" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">244</a></h3>
<p>Donghua's Offense and Defense Are Both Excellent - Agha's Attacks Missed, Failing to Score a Penalty Kick</p>
<p>One goal, the audience cheered; two goals, our army's morale soared; three goals, the enemy trembled; four goals, the entire stadium was shocked. The scene of Donghua defeating Agha yesterday can be summarized in the above words. Our defense is better than the enemy's, and our forwards are not as good as theirs. We can use our strengths to attack the enemy's weaknesses. When the opportunity comes, victory will be ours. This is why Donghua defeated Agha, and this is why they have been invincible in the previous 13 Group A games. From now on, the road ahead is smooth. With four games remaining, except for the Four Captives, there are also Jinan, the British Navy, and Lancashire, who are all no match. The Group A championship is safely in Donghua's hands. "Promote sports and promote the national spirit" was the declaration made by Mr. Sheng Xuanhuai, the founder of Donghua in previous years, when it was established. Now it has been realized. How can we not celebrate together?</p>
<h3 id="e245">Fiery, Ever-Changing, Difficult to Describe in Full <a href="#e245" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c245" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">245</a></h3>
<p>The north and south grandstands of Yiyuan were packed with people, with tense emotions, forgetting themselves, everyone relieving their sorrows, changing with the environment, unable to control themselves. The differences and similarities in national glory created the performance of the objects. The battle situation was ever-changing, and everyone was as if in a frenzy. The two teams of players, Chinese and Western spectators, pushed to men, women, old and young, all kinds of strange things, even if they held torches, it would not be enough to describe their emotions in full. How can a two-inch writing brush be able to describe even one ten-thousandth of it?</p>
<h3 id="e246">Through Hardship and Difficulty, Victory Depends on Strength of Will <a href="#e246" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c246" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">246</a></h3>
<p>Donghua's establishment of this immortal feat depends on everyone's efforts. Regardless of merit or reward, the defensive personnel performed well. The second half was even more seamless, and Zhou Xianyan's saving of the penalty kick was especially praised. The five forwards, Wan Xianghua and Chen Yutian, were like two elite soldiers, invincible. Chen Jiaqiu is still worthy of being a great general who is good at coping. Although Li Yichen scored two goals, he was taking credit for others, and his hesitation is still not gone. He cannot yet be called a genius, and we will wait for the future. Cao Qiuting was uneasy when he first faced a strong enemy. This is a necessary step before success, and he must not be discouraged. Donghua had the ability to lose twice, but was able to survive to the end. Self-help and God's help each accounted for half.</p>
<h3 id="e247">In the Midst of Strength, Defeat Was Due to the Weakness of the Inner Guard <a href="#e247" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c247" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">247</a></h3>
<p>Agha's five forwards ran fast, had excellent coordination, and shot fiercely. All three are good. Therefore, strong enemies were often seen pressing on Donghua's goal. If it were not for Donghua's strong defense, there would have been a danger of losing at every moment. Wan Xianghua made another breakthrough, but the central assistance was a little late, and the goalkeeper saved it. Under the command of Hayes, the Agha forwards advanced swiftly. Wu Youliang stole the ball and bumped into a person, which was ruled a foul, and a penalty kick was awarded. Central defender Hui Lie took the kick. In the cold winter, we know that pine and cypress survive. Zhou Xianyan actually saved the ball in an unrecoverable situation. From then on, the Donghua army was stable, taking the lead 3-0 in the first half.</p>
<h3 id="e248">Two Missed Goals Were a Sign of Agha's Failure <a href="#e248" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c248" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">248</a></h3>
<p>At the sound of the starting whistle, after dozens of rounds, neither side could achieve its goal. But the front line was slightly less [blank], and the inner [blank] was in shape, and the benefit was [blank]. Hugh [blank] in the inner [blank] was already [blank], Zhou Xianyan was also [blank], the goal was wide open, and Li Te [blank] quickly, and shot towards the goal, but the eagerness was too heavy, and it actually [blank] the goal post, and bounced back out. Willer added on, and Zhou Xianyan [blank] outside the goal. These two missed goals were a sign of Agha's failure.</p>
<h3 id="e249">Donghua Team Scored Three Goals in Ten Minutes <a href="#e249" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c249" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">249</a></h3>
<p>Donghua was under pressure from the enemy, and mostly defended and resisted with difficulty. Only Wan Xianghua was alone outside. At 25 minutes, Chen Jiaqiu assisted from afar, and Wan sprinted straight in, skillfully avoiding Hastings. Tao Dui was caught off guard, and passed the ball in. Chen Yutian arrived on time, and close at hand, nudged it into the net. Agha kicked off from the center, and tried hard to advance, but was blocked by Feng Yunyou, and turned back to its own formation. Li Yichen intercepted it halfway, lifted his foot, and flew it into the net. Five minutes later, Cao Qiuting suddenly got the ball, quickly passed it to Wan, ran forward three steps, and passed it to the center, falling in front of Li Yichen, who then kicked it in. The three goals were scored in a total of ten minutes, and the audience was shocked, our army's morale soared, and the enemy's courage was reduced at the same time.</p>
<h3 id="e250">Zhou Xianyan's Save of Penalty Kick Was Meritorious <a href="#e250" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c250" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">250</a></h3>
<p>Agha was three goals behind, and their morale was high. Their elite forwards were active in all four corners of Donghua. At that time, if it were not for the strength of Donghua's defense, there would have been a danger of losing at every moment. Wan Xianghua made another breakthrough, but Gu's central assistance was a little slow, and the goalkeeper saved it. Under the command of Hayes, the Agha forwards advanced quickly. Wu Youliang stole the ball and bumped into a person, which was ruled a foul, and a penalty kick was awarded. Central defender Hui Lie took the kick, [blank] and then Zhou Xianyan actually saved the ball in an unrecoverable situation. From then on, Donghua's morale was stable, taking the lead 3-0 in the first half.</p>

<p>In the renewed battle, the valiant forwards of Agha once again showed their strong feet. Although Zhou Xianyan rose up to attack, he then lowered his head and caught it. The tumultuous waves lasted for as long as ten minutes. Feng Yunyou carried the ball out of the pass, and Chen Yutian bravely sprinted forward, but failed at the enemy's goal front. At that time, Agha was assisted by the central guard, and the forwards were in high spirits. Donghua divided its troops to meet the attack, and there was no way to enter. In the middle, several counterattacks were ineffective due to Li Yichen's improper handling. In the last five minutes, Chen Yutian made a surprise attack and passed it to the center. Li Yichen and the goalkeeper collided and fell to the ground. Wan Xianghua jumped over the people and lightly kicked it in, creating a result of 4-0.</p>

<p>Youyou Football Team Wins Lancashire in Group A Football League</p>
<h3 id="e254">Result: 4-2 <a href="#e254" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c254" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">254</a></h3>
<p>The Youyou Football Team played against Lancashire in the Western League Group A match at the Chinese Baseball Field yesterday. As a result, Youyou won 4-1. Two or three thousand people watched. The details of the game are recorded below.</p>
<p>Youyou Team Has a New Lineup - The Youyou team has recruited talent and worked hard in training, hoping to restore its past glory from the Sanyu era. Since Sun Jinshun and Huang Hua from Hong Kong joined, their strength has been greatly consolidated. Now, Chen Guangyao, nicknamed "Locomotive," has come to Shanghai to join, and the lineup has become more complete. Yesterday's debutant, the lineup was very well connected with Sun Jinshun. The three of Hu Youcheng, Dong Xiaopei, and Xi Qiaosheng on the right are old partners, so the front line is quite strong. The midfielders and fullbacks are also extra careful, so yesterday's Youyou was not what it used to be.</p>
<p>Lancashire's Football Skills Are Average - This Lancashire is not the Lancashire of the past. This is a Lancashire army that came to Shanghai from London a week ago. As for the team's strength, it is similar to the past. The forwards and midfielders are very good. The center forward, Smith, is the bravest in terms of individual skills. It is a pity that the defenders are a bit weak and difficult to defend.</p>
<p>Foreigner Opens the Scoring First - With three bells ringing, referee Burton ordered the mobilization. Youyou kicked off and attacked first, but was trapped by the opponent's strict midfield defense, unable to find a way in. The ball was often on the enemy's feet. Three minutes later, Chen Guangyao kicked a corner kick, but Sun Jinshun's shot was too high, losing the opportunity. Lancashire then counterattacked, invading from the border. Ye Jinming lost his defense, and Qian Yaobin failed to block in time, allowing center forward Smith to open the Dragon's mouth and concede the first goal.</p>
<p>Dong Xiaopei Takes on the Defense Alone - Caught off guard, Youyou conceded a goal first. The British soldiers were furious and immediately sent troops to inquire. Dong Xiaopei and Xi Qiaosheng passed short passes and advanced, and the left winger coordinated and moved forward, passing through the enemy's midfield. Dong Xiaopei took on the defense alone, taking advantage of the opponent's internal emptiness, and marched majestically straight to the goal. At a suitable location, he succeeded in one fell swoop, making the score 1-1.</p>
<p>Sun "Iron Foot" Reaps the Benefits - From then on, Youyou's military power grew stronger, and the three armies worked hard. Huang Ruihua broke through the encirclement and handed the ball to Sun Jinshun. Sun was blocked, so he passed a short pass to Dong Xiaopei. Dong took a few steps forward, raised his foot and shot, and the ball was caught by the enemy goalkeeper. However, the goalkeeper fell to the ground in the momentum, and the ball landed next to him. Seeing the opportunity, Sun "Iron Foot" rushed forward and reaped the benefits. Youyou then took a 2-1 lead in the first half.</p>
<p>Sun and Hu Each Score Another Goal - With three drumbeats, the second battle began. The enemy army was eager to retaliate and worked extra hard. Youyou took advantage of the victory and was not weak. After five minutes, Xi Qiaosheng advanced from the border. At a suitable location, a high ball [blank] into the middle, and Hu Youcheng headed the ball into the goal. Two minutes later, Chen Guang[blank] landed [blank] in the net. Youyou won with a score of four to [blank], the result was a score of 4-2. At that time, Youyou was at its peak, rushing left and right, very brave. However, Lancashire suffered a heavy blow and was still unwilling, and was often seen sending troops to inquire, but suffering from Youyou's strict vigilance, there was no opportunity to take advantage of. Until the last seven minutes, Lancashire left winger Wood scored a goal, resulting in a final score of 4-2, Youyou created its second victory. The lineups of both sides are as follows:</p>
<p>▲Youyou Team</p>
<p>Chen Guangyao</p>

<h3 id="e257">Shanghai University Suffers Miserable Defeat Due to Chaotic Lineup <a href="#e257" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c257" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">257</a></h3>
<p>| Western YWCA Wins 39-36 |</p>
<p>Shanghai University's Mere Four Points in the First Half Proves Fatal</p>
<p>Third Final in the Coming Days</p>
<p>In last night's first Shanghai Basketball Association Group A final between Shanghai University and the Western YWCA, Shanghai University's lineup was chaotic in the first half, and their shots were inaccurate, making them at a loss. On the other hand, the Western YWCA was like a tiger pouncing on its prey, incomparably brave, making Shanghai University unable to attack or defend. The more than a thousand spectators could only sigh and be disappointed. The Western YWCA scored a total of 22 points, while Shanghai University only scored 4 points. This score was truly unexpected. In the second half, the situation became very tense. Shanghai University transformed from the flustered and timid state of the first half into a vigorous army. The audience regained their smiles and cheered enthusiastically. However, because they were too far behind in the first half, they suffered a miserable defeat to the Western YWCA by a difference of three points. The score was 36-39. The referees were Zhang Guoxun and Shu Hong, and there were over a thousand spectators, making it the first grand occasion of this season's basketball game.</p>
<h3 id="e258">The Curtain Rises on a Lifeless Scene <a href="#e258" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c258" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">258</a></h3>
<p>Slightly after eight o'clock, the Shanghai University team first entered the arena, followed by the foreign players of the West China YMCA team, also in athletic attire. After some initial warm-up throws, the referee signaled the start of the game. Shanghai University immediately found themselves under constant attack, struggling to defend. Smith of the YMCA team made two successful shots from under the basket, bringing the score to 4-2. It seemed they could compete equally, and the atmosphere was naturally tense. Unexpectedly, Shanghai University was trapped by the tight defense, unable to execute their plays. Wu Guolin repeatedly attempted long-range shots, all missing their mark, and the situation quickly became one-sided. The YMCA team found opportunities on both sides, playing with ease. White, Smith, and Zeiger constantly attacked the basket, scoring repeatedly. Meanwhile, Shanghai University seemed lifeless, surrounded and unable to defend against the onslaught. The score became a staggering 22 to 4. Finally, Sun Baoqing managed to score a basket, ending the first half with the score at 22-4. The situation was so dire that onlookers sighed in disappointment.</p>
<h3 id="e259">A Resurgence Begins, the Situation Changes <a href="#e259" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c259" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">259</a></h3>
<p>After this heavy blow, Shanghai University tried their best to rally. As the second half began, they fought hard, and the situation suddenly changed. The score gradually narrowed, and the spectators cheered wildly, making the atmosphere in the arena intensely exciting. Sun Baoqing made two free throws, showing great spirit. Smith immediately responded for the YMCA. Feng Nianhua also added a basket. At this time, the YMCA team remained brave, showing no weakness. Zeiger also added two points, believing that Shanghai University was still under pressure and unable to perform well. After a tense period, the score difference was only ten points. The supporters shouted themselves hoarse. The spirit of Shanghai University grew even stronger, and Sun Baoqing became especially courageous. In the last five minutes, Shanghai University's momentum surged. Wu Guolin repeatedly attempted long-range shots, all of which found their mark. Sun Baoqing assisted the attack, making great contributions. Feng Nianhua and Qian Jingyong also fulfilled their mission. The team advanced powerfully, playing with great enthusiasm, and their passion for the game was still high when the match suddenly ended. Checking the score, it was 39 to 36, with Shanghai University losing by a narrow margin of three points.</p>
<h3 id="e260">See You Next Week for the Final Showdown <a href="#e260" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c260" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">260</a></h3>
<p>In the first final match, Shanghai University was defeated. The reason for their defeat was undoubtedly their poor performance in the first half. If they had made just two more baskets, Shanghai University would have won. Scoring only four points was truly an unprecedented record in Shanghai University's history. Was it simply fate that they were destined to lose yesterday? It is difficult to understand the reasons. However, the first game is over. The second final match will take place next Tuesday. It is hoped that Shanghai University will do their best to avenge their loss. As for last night's game, White of the YMCA team was the most outstanding player, attentive in all aspects, brave and composed, running and stealing the ball quickly and steadily. Taylor's performance was average, and Zeiger Smith missed many opportunities. His shooting was not very accurate. Pyott was as brave as ever. The entire team had a solid formation, working together seamlessly, without any weaknesses. For Shanghai University, Sun Baoqing was the most outstanding, scoring a game-high fourteen points. Lu Zhongen was a spent force, only able to strategize, but appearing flustered during the game. Feng Nianhua and Qian Jingyong suffered disadvantages in size, lamenting that they had no room to maneuver. Wu Guolin still showed potential. The entire team should strive for calmness. The results of yesterday's game are as follows:</p>

<p>In the West China YMCA volleyball match, China YMCA won for the third time yesterday, achieving three wins in three matches, defeating their strong opponent, West China YMCA, with three straight sets: 15-13, 15-8, and 15-14, totaling 45 to 35 points. Both sides played carefully, the scores were close, and the atmosphere was tense. The outcome could influence the championship, making it a match that demanded close attention.

<p>Far Eastern Athletes Take the Field: The China YMCA lineup consists of Li Feiyun, Xu Heng, Chen Baoqiu, Tan Tianpei, Wei Ding, Cai Tiange, and Guo Naiyi, a total of seven players. Xu Heng is one of the athletes representing China at the Far Eastern Games. His power smash is still impressive. However, due to the different rules of the competition, he was unable to fully display his strengths. Li Feiyun, Chen Baoqiu, and Tan Tianpei all tried their best in setting, saving, and spiking. The West China YMCA lineup consists of Air, White, Smith, Pyott, Squier, and Bobriel.</p>
<p>Three Sets Filled with Tension: Although China YMCA won three straight sets, the score differences were very small. The outcomes of the first and third sets were only decided by the final two points. The first set was tied several times. China YMCA suddenly took a 12-8 lead, but West China YMCA then scored five consecutive points, surpassing them, making the situation precarious. China YMCA finally won 15-13. In the second set, China YMCA scored four points after being at 11-8, securing the win. In the last set, China YMCA came from behind from a 3-8 deficit to tie the score. Afterwards, the scores were tied at 11, 12, 13, and 14. China YMCA eventually won 16-14.</p>

<p>Letter: Letter from Shanghai Law School: To the Editor: I am writing to you because I read in the Education News section of your newspaper a news item about the welcome extended to George Bernard Shaw by major middle school students (according to the National News Agency) which stated that our school also sent representatives to the Youth Association meeting and that they were elected to positions. However, after investigation, our school did not send representatives to participate in this meeting. It is feared that this is hearsay or that someone has falsely claimed our name. Therefore, we are writing to clarify this matter and request that you make a correction so as to ensure accuracy and avoid misunderstandings. Sincerely, [addressed to] the Editor of Education News, Shen Bao.</p>

<p>— Zhan Lu</p>
<p>丨The Poor Seamstress and the Modern Girl丨</p>
<p>No one wants to pursue and depict the poor seamstresses from Jiangbei. Their clothing and profession are too unaesthetic! The dark black headscarf represents the color from Jiangbei, covered with a blue cotton jacket, "green and loose, like wrapping green onions." Below, she wears single-slit pants tied at the ankles, sitting on a portable bamboo chair, her legs crossed and stretched out. On her feet, she stubbornly wears a pair of outdated pointed-toe women's shoes, bending her head to do her sewing work in the evening sunlight. Next to her sits a treasure-blue basket filled with scraps of cloth, needle and thread, scissors, and all the necessary sewing tools. The words she speaks are always about lengthening or shortening something. Of all the people passing by who glance at her, you would be hard-pressed to find even one who notices.</p>
<p>Her hair is permed in curls that cost dozens of silver dollars each time. On her body, she wears a sable coat worth thousands of gold dollars. Below it, a glimpse of a colorful and luxurious robe. The heels of her high-heeled leather shoes are as slender and precarious as the tall stacks of tofu in old restaurants. Slender eyebrows, snow-white face, crimson lips – everything displays the power of cosmetics. A gust of fragrant wind, like her advance guard, passes by the poor seamstress, making the seamstress seem like dust, while this modern girl seems like a celestial being. How aesthetic this is!</p>
<p>The next day, the aesthetic modern girl passes by the poor seamstress again. Because the road repairs were not yet finished, the heel of her right high-heeled leather shoe caught on a jagged stone and broke off, turning into a lopsided shoe with one low heel and one high heel. She was truly embarrassed! If she wanted to go back, she couldn't walk on this one-high, one-low road. If she wanted to buy shoes, the "Queen Shoe Store" was half a mile away. She leaned to one side, waiting for a car by the side of the road, fully displaying the awkward expression of someone trying to show off and suddenly encountering misfortune.</p>
<p>The poor seamstress, while sewing, slightly raised her stone foot and said, "My shoes are made by myself and never break at the heel. Even if they are occasionally damaged, I take them off right away and sew them up in a few stitches. Why wait for a car or look for a shoe store?"</p>
<p>When the poor seamstress said these words, her attitude was leisurely, and her reasoning was sufficient. But the modern girl with the lopsided leather shoes became even more embarrassed! Alas! Her aesthetic image was bankrupt!</p>
<h3 id="e265">Street Angels <a href="#e265" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c265" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">265</a></h3>
<p>— Especially</p>
<p>丨What I Saw at the Intersection of Wangping Street丨</p>
<p>On the road, a crowd of people surged, each different, dragging their various bodies forward with the interplay of legs and feet. Even though the wind was blowing and the ground was wet and slippery, this did not diminish their courage.</p>
<p>The sky was so gloomy that it showed the darkness of dusk. At this time, at the intersection of Fuzhou Road and Wangping Street, a group of people with unusual expressions crowded together, haphazardly arranged on both sides of the road, the sound of laughter resonating in the air. Their clothing was very thin. Some were shivering, hugging their shoulders, and some were stomping their feet. Looking at their facial expressions, it fully symbolized their inner anticipation.</p>
<p>"What? It's already five o'clock, and they still haven't come?" A tall, thin middle-aged man said anxiously after looking at the clock in the store.</p>
<p>"They'll probably be here soon!"</p>
<p>"·······················"</p>
<p>Confusion, noise, wringing hands, scratching heads – all expressing the nervous anticipation of the people waiting.</p>
<p>"Ah, look, they're here!" The magic of these words instantly struck a chord in everyone's hearts. So, they stopped shivering and jumping, pushing each other to stand at the corner of the road, looking westward.</p>
<p>A person with a cloth bag on their back rode over on a bicycle as if flying. Without saying a word, they were immediately surrounded.</p>
<p>"Hey! Thirty copies!"</p>
<p>"I want fifty copies!"</p>
<p>"······················"</p>
<p>The person with the bag was busy handing them out to the people crowding around.</p>
<p>"Do you want the evening newspaper?"</p>
<p>"Want to see it? Important news from Jiugemen!"</p>
<p>All kinds of different voices immediately floated away from the center in all directions.</p>

<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>When Kaijun looked at her face, adorned with powder and rouge, and her scarlet lips, he couldn't help but think of the rumors from outsiders. Although he was an open-minded person, after seeing her, he still felt that she exuded charm. The ancients said: "Beautiful as peach blossoms, dignified as frost." That is a good balance. Now, she has the glory of peach blossoms and plums but lacks the sternness of frost. Like the wine of roses, filled with sweetness, it's no wonder some people are drooling with desire! After she greeted Kaijun and his mother, she went to Kaijun and smiled slightly, saying, "I have something to discuss with you that I need your agreement for..." Before she could finish, Kaijun was stunned and couldn't help but put down his pen, asking, "Auntie Ju, what do you want to talk about?" She smiled again and said, "My life is pitiful, as Brother Kai already knows, so I don't need to go into detail. I think that continuing like this is not a long-term plan. I really want to go out and find some work to solve my livelihood. I don't want to live such a boring life without any support, which is very dangerous. But my education is really insufficient, so I can't even talk about finding work. Therefore, from today onwards, I want to dedicate myself to learning, so that one day I can have some knowledge and find a way to support myself, so that I don't have to endure this indefinite suffering. However, I have no one to help me, no money to go to school, and I'm not young anymore, so it's hard to get in. The best way is to study on my own. Tutoring requires the guidance of a good teacher to succeed. Brother Kai is the best teacher. I have already bought an English reader, and I want to ask you to teach me for one hour every day, whether it's morning or evening, just whenever you have time. You are sympathetic to me, so you should be able to allow me to do this. If I succeed in the future, I will be forever grateful. I wonder what Brother Kai thinks?" As she spoke, her eyes were fixed on Kaijun, and her attitude was very sincere.</p>
<p>After listening to her request, Kaijun thought, "So, this is what it's about." She spoke so sincerely that people couldn't help but help. Moreover, as a school teacher, I teach people every day, so how can I refuse her? And, from a rational point of view, this is also a good thing. Imparting knowledge to a lonely and pitiful woman, so that she can find a way to support herself in the future, is naturally a work of immense merit and a bounden duty in terms of humanitarianism. If I were to refuse, I wonder how upset she would be? While he was hesitating and hadn't answered immediately, Kaijun's mother, who was beside him, also expressed her approval. Kaijun didn't even have room to consider before he hastily agreed. From this day onwards, there was a special female student in Kaijun's study. The time was not fixed, because she had to take advantage of Kaijun's free time, but it was mostly in the evening. In addition to tutoring English, she also occasionally asked Kaijun to guide her in Chinese. (3)</p>
<h3 id="e267">Respect for Women <a href="#e267" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c267" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">267</a></h3>
<p>— Xianxian</p>
<p>丨Not Valuing Sons Over Daughters丨</p>
<p>Westerners respect women. Women wear cloaks, men serve them, women go out, men open doors and wait, women sit on trams, men stand up to offer their seats. In whatever matter, whatever men can do to help, they may not slack off. This is a kind of golden rule. If they dare to deliberately violate it, they are not worthy of the title of great citizens of civilized countries. As barbaric as our Chinese people are, after students who specialized in etiquette return home from overseas to promote it, and with the practice of talented men from foreign companies, the status of a first-class barbaric country has been raised to a third-class civilized country. Making an effort to promote and carry out [respect for women] is not only a small contribution; it is truly a uniquely great achievement.</p>
<p>But, wait a minute. Is this civilization just a mere imitation of Western customs? In my opinion, it is worth studying and considering further. So-called respect for women, at its maximum, is merely for women who are alive – not to insult, underestimate, but to respect them. This kind of respect for women is acquired. Furthermore, all etiquette for women is ultimately due to customs and ritual teachings. It inevitably feels awkward, somewhat forced and contrived. We Chinese, not boasting, not lying, have books as proof. In the Tang Dynasty, in the general thinking of the masses, there was already the concept of not valuing sons over daughters. This concept is for the piece of meat in the womb. It is completely innate. Furthermore, this concept is a complete internal expression. It is definitely not just idle talk. Foreigners open their mouths and shut their mouths, saying, “Respect women.” But if they give birth to a prince, they fire 101 cannons. If they give birth to a princess, they only fire 21 cannons. How can it be as completely authentic as our country's concept of not valuing sons over daughters?</p>
<p>European and American countries have novel inventions. When Chinese people say that China already knew how to use it thousands of years ago, foreigners often use it as a joke, laughing so hard they nearly fall over, saying that Chinese people all have megalomania. But I am now saying again that Chinese people practiced the matter of respecting women earlier than Westerners. I wonder if the foreign adults or quasi-foreigners will laugh at me again?</p>

<p>— Yinping</p>
<p>Once upon a time, there was a very clever prince. Princes and princesses from faraway lands all came to visit him because of his reputation. One day, he saw a very beautiful princess and really wanted to marry her, but although he was very clever, he did not know what love was. He very bluntly asked the princess: "Are you willing to be my wife?"</p>
<p>"You don't even know how to say any words of love, how can you be called clever, how can I be willing to be your wife?"</p>
<p>"I know everything, except love," the prince said.</p>
<p>"Then you should go and learn!"</p>
<p>So the prince left her to go and learn about love.</p>
<p>× × × ×</p>
<p>First, he met Spring. Spring was holding a water pitcher and wearing a flower crown, like a young woman. The prince asked her: "What is love?"</p>
<p>"Love makes you drunk," Spring weakly stretched her tired limbs and replied.</p>
<p>The prince walked on and met Summer. He asked her the same question. Summer replied: "Love makes you suffer."</p>
<p>Going further, he saw Autumn. Autumn remained silent, not saying a single word. She only scattered leaves in the wind, as if implying: "Love makes you sorrowful."</p>
<p>The prince went to Winter's side and saw her wearing snow-white clothes. Her words spoke in seriousness: "Love is destruction."</p>
<p>× × × ×</p>
<p>We know that this clever prince would not say things exactly as he heard them. When he arrived at the princess's place, he said: "Now I have heard a lot about love, and they all say that love is life, is happiness. Now are you willing to marry me and be my wife?"</p>
<p>So the princess became his wife.</p>
<h3 id="e269">Hopscotch <a href="#e269" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c269" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">269</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Yian</p>
<p>Hopscotch is a common game among children in Shanghai. Its earliest origins cannot be traced, but most children who have grown up in Shanghai generally know how to play this game. I think this game is closely related to smooth cement floors.</p>
<p>Now, let's introduce the rules of the hopscotch game.</p>
<p>The number of players is from two to four or five.</p>
<p>Choose a smooth piece of ground. Cement floors are the most suitable. Use white chalk to draw several squares on the ground, either in one row or two rows. Each row has several squares. The number of squares can be determined temporarily. Each square is about two feet in length and width. These squares symbolize "houses."</p>
<p>Each person prepares a small brick or other object of similar weight and about two or three inches in size, such as a stone, iron piece, or copper piece.</p>
<p>Game Rules: The first player throws the small brick into the first house. With one foot raised, they hop into the house on one foot, then use that foot to kick the brick out of the house. Then, they hop out. While in the house, the raised foot cannot touch the ground.</p>
<p>After hopping out of the house, they pick up the small brick and throw it into the second house. They then hop on one foot into the first house, and from the first house, they hop into the second house. Then, they kick the small brick out again.</p>
<p>Afterward, each house is hopped over in this way until all the houses have been hopped over without breaking the rules. If the throwing, hopping, and kicking are all correct, that is the first success. They can then arbitrarily take a house (square). In this house, they use white chalk to write their mark. Others cannot step inside it when hopping.</p>
<p>Then several people take turns hopping in order, until all the houses have been taken. This is the end of the game.</p>
<p>This is the most common way to play hopscotch. In addition, there are other creative ways, adding some fresh patterns. These will not be described one by one here. "Hopping" is originally an action that children aged seven or eight to eleven or twelve like the most. This is very closely related to their physiology and psychology. The effect can satisfy them psychologically, and it can help them develop and strengthen physically and be lively in their movements. "Hopscotch" is a kind of hopping with rules, organization, and interest. It is worth encouraging and promoting. I think small schools in Shanghai could definitely dedicate a piece of land for children to play this game in the future.</p>
<p>It should be noted that when hopping, the front part of the sole should be used, and it is best to wear rubber-soled shoes.</p>

<p>— Pu</p>
<p>In England today, there are two globally renowned scholars. One is the 77-year-old George Bernard Shaw, who caused a sensation and recently left Shanghai. The other is philosopher Bertrand Russell, who lectured in China twelve years ago. We know that both are world-famous for their insightful observations. After traveling in China, Russell published numerous writings praising ancient Chinese culture, compiled into a special volume that sold widely. Unfortunately, the old man Shaw's time in China was too short, and the places he passed through were mostly Westernized areas like Hong Kong and Shanghai (he didn't even see the northern and southern districts of Shanghai, let alone the rural villages). Therefore, some people think it's difficult to expect him to give us any profound criticism. However, there are two points that he had already heard about before his visit—now that he has personally been there, especially seeing the literati and scholars in Hong Kong and Shanghai, as well as the bustling merchants and coolies on the streets. The first point is that China currently "has no culture to speak of." According to the words of Shaw published by our newspaper reporter yesterday, there are these few criticisms of China: "According to the meaning of culture, as explained by science, it is everything human behavior that can increase human happiness, especially the control of nature. In China, except in the countryside where one can still find a little culture, there is no culture to speak of. Today, China is importing many so-called 'cultures' from Western Europe that have already lost their effectiveness and are harmful to the public, such as the parliamentary system, educational methods, etc. What is the benefit of these?" What we need to further explain about this criticism is that Shaw's so-called "China has no culture to speak of" should be interpreted as "China's old culture is gradually disappearing, and new culture has not yet risen." This interpretation avoids ambiguity. Because Shaw has not seen the true face of rural China, he has not tasted any of the flavor of Chinese culture. What he criticizes is merely an intellectual imagination. However, this imagined criticism does not conflict with the starting point of his friend Russell's praise, because Russell traveled extensively in the interior and had considerable observation and exploration of our country's rural customs and inland habits. The object he analyzed was based on Shaw's imagined "countryside." However, now, more than a decade later, the condition of our country can be said to worsen year by year, and the collapse of the rural economy is especially obvious, which is perhaps something Mr. Russell did not foresee.</p>
<p>The second point that Shaw knows is the lack of organization among the Chinese people. Therefore, his exhortation to the students in Hong Kong was to call on them to have organization and planning in their revolution. In his remarks in Shanghai a few days ago, he also focused on this meaning.</p>
<p>Looking at the opinions expressed by Shaw yesterday, on the surface, he doesn't seem to have any special suggestions for the problem of the way out for this nation without culture and organization, but in reality, he has already given us a very clear and concrete hint. He said that China is importing Western European cultures that have lost their effectiveness and are harmful to the public, which means that if China wants to seek a way out for the nation, it should re-develop and promote its own "culture that can be found in the countryside"! Based on the scientific definition of culture, we should strive to advance along the path of jointly increasing human happiness. He said that the revolutionary method of transforming the status quo requires organized and planned struggle to be effective.</p>
<p>Seeing the current situation of the country's demise, families ruined, and the people living in misery, if we are unwilling to be "people awaiting death" and still have the determination to save ourselves, then we should express sincere acceptance of the hints given to us by this old friend passing through, and unanimously advance along the two paths of "creating a new culture" and "organizing to save ourselves." At this critical moment of life and death, we have no time to hesitate and wait and see.</p>

<p>— Xiang</p>
<p>Last year, because of a flood in my hometown, I fled to Shanghai. At first, I did small business, but in less than half a year, all my capital was exhausted. I had no choice but to ask someone to find me work in a textile mill, but it took a long time to succeed. Later, I spent three dollars and finally found a job in the Dakang Textile Mill in Pudong. There were so many people registering that day! It was simply a sea of people, so crowded that no water could escape, which frightened my timid heart. After registering, everyone stood in line, tall and short, like a women's army. At this time, Japanese people came to choose, no small feet, pointed feet were also dangerous, ugly people were certainly not wanted, and people with pockmarks on their faces were even more unwanted. Everyone listened silently to the selection, like taking the imperial examinations in the past. Those who were not wanted were pushed out of the line with fists. Those who were pushed felt disappointed and suffered physical pain, which was really infuriating. Then, doctors came to examine the body, using instruments to listen to our chests, looking back and forth, touching hands and feet, busy without end. Anyone found with even a small illness was rejected. After that, fingerprints were taken, small photos were taken, and questions were asked. After all the procedures were completed, cards were issued the next day, allowing them to start work, and foremen were sent to guide the work. The wages of these novice female workers are very low, but the work is very hard. When I entered the factory, I really broke out in a sweat! Now that I am working in the factory, I see that the female workers in the factory, whether novices or experienced workers, are often beaten and kicked by the Japanese devils, which is really frightening!</p>

<p>— Shang</p>
<p>"Hey! Is there anyone outside? Send one person in." A loud and shrill voice shouted from the kitchen in the back.</p>
<p>In fact, I had already heard it, but I still pretended not to hear and continued to sweep my floor.</p>
<p>It's not that I'm lazy. To be honest, among us apprentice brothers, I'm considered one of the more diligent ones! Although I can't say how diligent I am.</p>
<p>I really didn't want to see the master's wife's hideous and terrifying, man-eating appearance. Since I entered the shop, it had been a full ten months, but I had never seen her speak to us in a kind or pleasant manner. Her order had come again. I thought to myself, I'll pretend to be deaf, and one of my apprentice brothers will go in! But the fact was beyond my expectations. They all took the same attitude as me, doing their own things, and no one responded.</p>
<p>"Is there anyone outside after all!" The master's wife's urging order came again.</p>
<p>"X! Did you hear that? Your master's wife is calling you!" The accountant, Mr. Mao, held a water pipe in one hand and a paper blower in the other, walking out of the accounting room while blowing. He didn't call this one or that one, but specifically called me.</p>
<p>I couldn't bear it any longer. On one side, I busily responded, "Oh! Coming," and on the other side, I quickly swept the dust into a corner and ran in as if flying.</p>
<p>"What! Didn't you hear me calling you? Lazy thief!"</p>
<p>"No! I responded! I was sweeping the floor in the hall! Master's wife!"</p>
<p>Fortunately, I answered quickly and shouted "Master's wife," otherwise, another scolding would have been unavoidable.</p>
<p>"Go to Wantong Soy Sauce Garden and buy two dollars of sesame oil and one dollar of soy sauce, quickly!" She said, handing me three dollars.</p>
<p>I already knew that there were no good errands when called inside. The goose-feather-like snow was falling outside, and I had to go to the soy sauce garden half a mile away to buy oil and soy sauce. But, as an apprentice, what could I do!</p>
<p>Dragging out two greasy and dark urns from the dark corner of the kitchen, I held one in each hand, braved the snow, and walked out of the back door. The urns were slippery, and I had to squeeze them hard. The skin on the back of my hand, which had cracked, seeped out drops of blood. The snow fell on it, and the warmth melted it into water. After a while, my hands were all red, as if they had been painted with a layer of red ink. I wore a pair of overshoes on my feet, and walking on the snow, the frostbite was both painful and itchy. But, as an apprentice, I had to keep walking forward!</p>
<p>Far, far away, I saw the two large characters "Wantong" on the wall. My heart was filled with endless comfort. Although there was no coal stove or brazier there, at least it could give me a short rest. Because of the joy in my heart, I couldn't help but speed up my pace.</p>
<p>Slippery... the ruthlessness of the snow, just when I was about to reach my destination, it still made me slip! My hands and feet were numb, but I could barely get up. Looking back at the ground, a piece of red was reflected in the snow. Fortunately, I was okay. After inspecting my whole body, a piece of skin had been scraped off the back of my right hand. Luckily, it was numb, and I didn't feel any pain for the time being. But, damn it! The urn in my right hand was broken.</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>I stared blankly at the pieces of the urn in the snowdrift for a long time, not knowing what to do. I thought it would be better to buy one outside than to go back and get a scolding from the master's wife. Feeling in my cotton-padded jacket pocket, the eight cents monthly allowance that Mr. Mao gave me half a month ago, there were still six cents here. But if I had to pay for the broken urn, where would the money for haircuts, laundry, bathing, etc. for the next half month come from? Otherwise, could I endure her scolding all day long? After thinking for a long time, "It's better to be honorable than wealthy." After all, relying on my courage, I paid for the urn and came back with the oil and soy sauce.</p>
<p>As soon as I stepped into the back door, I quickly stuffed the two urns into that dark corner and ran to the front hall without looking back. Sure enough, the voice of "Little devil! You're only coming now after so long, you must have been wandering outside" came from inside again.</p>
<p>I was really reckless. I got hurt, lost money, and still had to suffer her complaints. I couldn't wait to turn around and argue with her, but thinking about the disgrace of an apprentice returning halfway, a wave of resentment and hot tears were suppressed in my stomach.</p>

<p>— Duo Fei</p>
<p>Slowing down customers can seriously damage business, which is something no one can deny.</p>
<p>I feel that we should assume that all customers who come to patronize us have good intentions, and there is no reason to treat them lightly. Although many customers come in, look around, and watch the excitement without intending to buy anything; or they pick and choose and ultimately don't buy a single item; however, in the near future, they actually have the potential to become our real customers. If we slight them, then we will lose this customer forever. Customers have the right to pick and choose goods, no matter how picky. If they ask this and ask that, we have an obligation to provide as much information as possible. We must not be annoyed and show a displeased expression. Some less attractive customers insist on rounding down when paying after the goods are wrapped. We can only explain politely and ask them to forgive us. If they say something impolite because they refuse to reduce the price, we can only consider them extremely ignorant and not bother to argue with them. What is the victory for us shop assistants? It is to be able to complete the transaction. Even if it doesn't work out, our goods are still there, and we won't suffer any loss.</p>
<p>Our attitude towards any customer must be humble, sincere, and patient. Not only should shop assistant service be like this, but it is also an indispensable virtue for us to be people.</p>
<p>Northern shop assistants, when customers enter, regardless of whether they know them or not, will definitely smile and ask intimately, "You are well! It's been so long since we've seen each other!" When customers pay, they will also say politely, "You don't need to pay, just take this with you!" Although this is inevitably excessive and insincere, it is not worth emulating, but their attitude is so humble! Many shop assistants in Hankou glare at customers who fail to agree on a price, saying, "Coming to get a free meal, okay?" The meaning of "getting a free meal" is to ridicule you for never having tasted meat and not expecting to get a free meal here. This is not only "slighting" but simply giving the customer a major insult. Customers cannot tolerate it, so they often end up scolding each other and even fighting. You want to do business but end up scolding and fighting with customers, isn't that a joke? Shop assistants in the Jiangsu and Zhejiang regions don't seem to have this bad habit, and even if they slow down customers, they won't slow them down to this extent. However, their cold and indifferent faces are enough to make customers suffer.</p>
<p>But the customers they slow down are mostly people who are plainly dressed and have a bit of a rural air. For the grand gentlemen, ladies, young masters, and young ladies who are gorgeously dressed and behave lavishly, not only do they not dare to slow them down, but they often have to prepare to endure their anger.</p>
<p>I feel that all customers who patronize us, whether they are high-ranking officials or beggars, are the same customers in our eyes. We should not discriminate based on the size of the transaction or the social status of the customer, holding a snobbish mentality. We must always take a humble, sincere, and patient attitude and deal with any customer in the same way.</p>
<p>My conclusion is that we should not slight beggar customers, nor should we flatter and be particularly flattering to the grand gentlemen. We don't need to smear "Stancombe" on our heads and "Snow Cream" on our faces, and be particularly ingratiating to ladies with oily tongues and slippery faces. As long as they are customers, we should treat them equally. At the same time, we must not forget the essential virtues of humility, sincerity, and patience!</p>

<p>— Wen Huan</p>
<p>In the abnormally developed society of today, due to the unreasonableness of the social organization, the general cost of living is gradually increasing. The broad proletarian masses are all busy finding jobs, and they have no time to study. As soon as a child is born, he is regarded as a member of the family's producers. As long as there is a place to eat, he is pushed into the threshold of the store, so that he bears the considerable burden that he should bear in the whole family, so as to reduce the burden of his father and brothers. Everything else is a secondary issue. Even if there are children with intelligence and qualifications who have the materials to study, they are exploited because of environmental reasons; or even during the period of studying, they have to leave school life and go to society to find their own lives. Under such a social organization, I don't know how many geniuses have been buried and how many young people have been ruined.</p>
<p>The opposite fact is that there are more people than there are jobs. As soon as students leave school, they immediately become unemployed. When they were in school, they were full of ambition to transform society, but now they are softened and sacrificed by society. In this dark year, all departments are invariably accompanied by the form of business combination and trustification. A young man who has just emerged from the wilderness is undoubtedly surrounded by heavily fortified walls and cannot find his way in; unless you have great connections. Invariably deeply mired in the situation of hitting walls. Don't see the recruitment column and employment column in the newspaper recruiting personnel every day. To put it bluntly, it's just collecting a large number of registration fees and skimming everyone's oil. The quota for recruitment has already been taken by those with great connections who have arrived first. Under such circumstances, it doesn't matter whether you are a foreign product imported from abroad, or a purely domestic product, you can't find a way out. This is obviously the disintegration of education and profession, "what is learned is not what is used, and what is used is not what is learned," which is its greatest characteristic.</p>
<p>From these two aspects, on the one hand, the opportunity to study is sacrificed because of finding a job, and on the other hand, graduating from school leads to the contradictory fact of not being able to get a job. This is clearly the product of the current social system, because the essence of the current society is commodity substitution. The reflection in education is also full of commodified content, making education the private property of a few moneyed classes, and the majority of the proletarian masses are rejected outside the scope of education. At the same time, the result of commodification makes education and production the same, regardless of the needs of society, and blindly mass-produced. Therefore, in the industry, overproduction is formed, causing the panic of unemployment; in education, overabundance of talents and a sharp increase in literati, causing the difficulty of finding a job. Therefore, this is a fundamental social problem, which requires a thorough solution, so that this unreasonable society can quickly collapse and be replaced by a reasonable and equal social organization. In that society, naturally there will be no phenomenon of oversupply. At that time, education will be shared by everyone, and as soon as students leave school, they will have work that they are capable of doing, and there will be no danger of unemployment, like in the Soviet Union now. But in the current stage before reaching that society, everyone must make the greatest efforts, within the possible scope, to obtain lofty knowledge and obtain a considerable profession, so as to remedy the deficiency in the current process.</p>

<p>— Hui Zun</p>
<p>In the crowded trams heading towards the Bund in the early morning, I have often stared at the faces of each of my fellow passengers. I have often found that the first faces are yellow with a touch of pallor, fully expressing "fatigue and not healthy." Most of them (and me too) are small clerks in the business world, and driven by life, they have no choice but to move their tired and unhealthy bodies back into the office!</p>
<p>Of course, under the current world economic panic, compatriots in semi-colonial countries will naturally have a few more symptoms of malnutrition due to the tribulations of life. However, the fact that our compatriots have never paid attention to physical education is also a reason.</p>
<p>Pay attention to physical education? This presents another difficulty. First, in this Shanghai where land is so precious, except for the gardens of a few capitalists that can be used as sports fields, the courtyards of most people's homes are not even twenty square feet. It is impossible to take a walk, let alone talk about sports? Second, sports equipment, does not every item require money to buy? Tennis rackets, footballs, basketballs, iron dumbbells, arm-exercising springs... so many strange things to exercise the body, are not all of them expensive? How can we, the small clerks with a monthly salary of twenty or thirty dollars, have the money to buy them? Therefore, as for "sports," we can only sigh in vain!</p>
<p>However, we cannot therefore not exercise our bodies. We need a body of iron, even more than the rich, so in desperation, we have no choice but to think of some "hard training" methods.</p>
<p>In the fresh air of the early morning, the roads are lovably empty, with few people. During this time, we can invite a few like-minded friends to have a longer distance race. Without spending a penny, our two legs will first gain the foundation of health (people with weaker bodies can change to walking).</p>
<p>The legs are exercised, but the two arms still lack exercise. Here, I have come up with another "poor man's equipment." This equipment is shown in the following diagram:</p>
<p>A B C D E F</p>
<p>Explanation: A wooden handle</p>
<p>B Hard lead wire</p>
<p>C Beef tendon (a little thinner than a horsewhip)</p>
<p>D Iron-core pulley</p>
<p>E Wooden handle (pulley device in the lower half)</p>
<p>F Weight Use a bag of foreign flour, filled with sand and mud,</p>
<p>Because sand and mud can be gradually increased)</p>
<p>It costs about one dollar to make this equipment.</p>
<p>After it is made, it can be hung on the ceiling. When you want to exercise, hold A in one hand and E in the other, and spread your arms open with force, then slowly close them. Practice dozens of times every day. In less than a month, your two arms must be hard and strong, but pay attention to two things: ㈠ Don't hold your breath, ㈡ Don't shrug your shoulders.</p>
<p>Hard training! Build up health!</p>

<p>To shoot a man, first shoot his horse, to capture a thief, first capture his king, rows of rifles are aimed at her;</p>
<p>Fierce firepower cannot suppress her courage, "Bang!" A ruthless bullet penetrated her chest.</p>
<p>× × × × ×</p>
<p>The brothers held her up with tears; the stretcher team stumbled to the scene; the head of the medical team only sighed that there was no medicine to heal; "Is there any divine power that can take back her life?"</p>
<p>× × × × ×</p>
<p>But the smile is still lingering on her cheeks, and the gray lips are still trembling; "Now, I want to hand over the responsibility to you; now, you can give me a kiss."</p>
<p>× × × × ×</p>
<p>The earth-shattering cries can no longer wake her up, a star falls from the sky and disappears; but the ship of the world is moving forward forever,</p>
