<h3 id="c30">平津華北與整個局面 <a href="#c30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>— 德</p>
<p>邇日前敵情勢。日形緊急。石匣失。渡灤河。唐山棄。炸密雲。平津已處於高屋建瓴之殆勢。而内復奸細潛伏。甘爲虎倀。人心浮動。不可終朝。旣未見政府有整個防守之打算。而前線持久苦戰之少數部隊。又皆已成强弩之末。事實上决無力以捍衛此强敵俯瞰下之危城。敵宣言曰。「必得平津。」吾人翹首北望。誠不勝其憂懼。尤不勝其悲憤。</p>
<p>平津而失。則華北難保。華北不保。則我國全局動搖。此其間蓋瞭如指掌。毫無可疑。故今日平津之危急。已爲我整個民族之生死關鍵。情勢之嚴重。又已與遼吉陷落熱河失守時不可同日而語。吾人若仍等閒視之。而漠不關心。則指顧之間。我國必且步安南朝鮮之後。國家旣亡。民族即淪爲奴隷。斯時雖欲愛國欲救國。亦已不可得矣。</p>
<p>然而就目前事實而觀。吾人不能不認爲我舉國上下。今皆有若已抱定甘作亡國奴之决心。政府自始至終。未見有整個防守之計劃。徒以少許部隊。與强敵作有若兒戲之抵禦。日曰成立新陣地。日曰作戰略上之撤退。於是敵日進迫。我日後退。而疆土亦日以蹙。國難亦日以深。此種危險之狀態。誠爲曠古所無。兩月以前。北平古物已分批南運。目前平津各校。又正計畫南遷。而土地與人民則置之不顧。是何居心。是何打算。吾人誠莫測高深。其尤可痛者。則國危至此。而川亂又再次爆發。舉國努力自相殘殺。視當前之大敵。漠然無動於中。嗟乎。煑豆燃𦮎。閉門相殘。親者痛心。仇者快意。漁夫環伺。吾其終爲鷸蚌乎。</p>
<p>至在我人民方面。亦若人存苟安旦夕之心。於國事毫不顧恤。迴憶去歲一二八之役。上海在炮火荼毒之下。閘北成一片焦土。敵我血肉相拚。出生入死。滬人目覩。驚心動魄。然而上海以外之各地。則漠不關心。宴安耽毒。一如平時。今日平津緊急。人心惶惶。不可終朝。而平津以外之地。則仍高歌酣舞。漫若無事。即以上海而言。靡靡之樂。狐步之舞。紙醉金迷。正樂而忘死。「商女不知亡國恨。隔江猶唱後庭花。」吾人於此種絕不應有之怪現象。亦惟有撫膺痛哭而已。</p>
<p>世間惟死與亡國。不可嘗試。蓋人死不可復生。國旣亡亦不易恢復。抑且一死萬事都了。在死者固已毫無痛楚。至於亡國。則全民族淪爲牛馬奴隷。求死不得。求生不能。其痛苦。其慘毒。絕非想像所可得。國人今日之宴安耽毒。視國家之危亡。漠然不加喜戚。其爲尙未識亡國之苦味乎。則印度埃及朝鮮緬甸。皆吾人眼前之殷鑑。其所遭遇之慘痛爲何如也。</p>
<p>總之今日平津危急。非平津之局部問題。而已爲關係我全國生死之整個問題。救平津即所以救華北。救華北亦即所以救中國。時危勢迫。吾人急應作整個之打算。整個之籌謀。此時已爲最後僅有之時機。我政府我國民。都應有最後之覺醒。作最後之打算。</p>

<p>（華盛頓）美總統羅斯福籲請世界和平保障宣言書、昨電已報告大綱、此文係超越日内瓦壇坫、直接送達五十四國元首、將軍縮會議内繼續作國家主義的斤斤論價之禍患、警醒歐洲、而圖消除未來世界經濟會議失敗之朕兆、文内除勸告舉世接受英首相麥唐納之軍縮提議、作爲避免戰禍之第一步外、且邀各國自行保證勿遣武裝隊伍至國境以外、並附以强有力之警告、倘有任何强國拒絕明確記錄其反對侵略行爲之志願者、則異日災禍之臨、舉世將知咎責之攸歸、望各國勿負此重大責任、</p>
<h3 id="c35">諮商公約 <a href="#c35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>英國軍縮計劃内規定一種諮商制度、美總統此舉、足徴美國向來峻拒受諮商公約束縛之外交政策、業已有重要之變遷、</p>
<h3 id="c36">和平保障 <a href="#c36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>此外美總統又提議、當此普天下軍縮之機器、正在英國計劃下運轉不息之時、不應再增現有之武備與兵力、各國宜莊嚴保證勿使其作戰武器有所增加、羅斯福總統曾在文内聲稱、當此减縮軍備之全時期内、世界之和平、必須有所保證、故余提議一第四步驟、即與此三項提議同時並行、而又完全依賴於此三項提議之忠實履行、並受現有條約權利之約束、</p>
<h3 id="c37">建議三條 <a href="#c37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>余提議世界各國應締　結一莊嚴切實之不侵略公約、余又提議各國應莊嚴重申其所負限制與裁減軍備之義務、余再提議苟各簽約國皆能忠實履行此項義務、則各國應各個同意勿派任何性質之武裝隊伍至其國境以外、</p>
<h3 id="c38">明定責任 <a href="#c38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>美總統又警告各國、謂常識詔我、倘任何强國拒絕以眞正誠意加入全世界聯合努力、以策政治與經濟之和平、則此兩大聯合努力、一在日内瓦一在倫敦、將致阻滯而不獲進步、一旦至此、則渴求雨種和平之文明世界、將知失敗責任之誰屬矣、余勸各國萬勿負此重大責任、切望參加兩大會議之國家、各將其所秉之政策見諸行事、</p>
<p>最後美總統又指陳當此人人亟須担荷維持世界和平重任之時、宜各掃除小障碍、損棄小目的、並在結語聲稱、余信貴政府將能加入以實現此種希望云云、</p>
<h3 id="c39">行文蘇俄 <a href="#c39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>美總統此文係直達五十四國元首、蘇俄亦在其列、逕致蘇聯中央執行委員會主席喀列寗、查美國總統直接致文於一未經承認之國家、猶屬第一次、亦大可注意之事實、說者以爲足見羅斯福總統所抱召集全世界共策和平大業志願之亟切、</p>
<p>此文刻正錄副送國會、以備查考、因美國苟加入任何國際協定、必須經參院批准故也、羅氏昨日發出此文前、曾與參院領袖數人晤商頗久、逆料當已獲得參院將可批准美國加入所擬公約之保證、</p>
<h3 id="c40">掃除紊亂 <a href="#c40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>再美總統此次籲請和平保證、其本意實在謀致世界經濟會議之完全勝利、故文中於論及國際關係時、聲稱列國爲掃除經濟界紊亂起見、曾召集兩大會議、世界經濟會議不久即將舉行、且須迅速結束世界不能坐待曠日持久之討論、此會必須安定幣價、自由流通世界貿易、與國際共同提高物價、藉以樹立秩序、而袪現有之紛擾、吾輩必須稍歛各個的内政計劃、共爲賢明而深慮之國際行動、以策經濟之興復、軍縮會議業逾一年、猶未能獲致美滿之結果、種種雜亂之提議、依然作危險之衝突、</p>
<h3 id="c41">恢復繁榮 <a href="#c41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>吾輩今日責任、端在以最大多數之最大福利爲根據、藉聯合行動、以謀切實可行之結果、須知全世界男子婦女孩童之生命及其快樂與繁榮、皆繫於各政府在最近的將來之决議、嗣乃指陳軍縮對於經濟會議之影響、苟有他種糾葛在吾人之前、疇能安心决定經濟問題、並稱國家之設置軍備、不外二種理由、少數國家欲得鄰邦之領土、但大多數則爲懼他人之侵略、現代侵略武器遠比防衛武器爲鋒利、此種畏慮確有理由、故若各國皆能完全同意、勿復置用侵略武器、則國防自有金湯之固、而各國之邊界與獨立亦俱安固、則畏懼他人侵略之心自然消釋矣、（十六日國民電）</p>

<p>頑强之德國亦表示贊同</p>
<p>意政府宣佈無條件接受</p>
<p>獨法國尙懷疑默無表示</p>
<p>（華盛頓）美總統籲請保障和平文、各國政府已多有接受提議與讚美政策之應聲、即對於軍縮最稱頑强而使美總統作此非常舉動之德國、亦有贊同表示、德官場咸信此文已開啓解决爭執之途、</p>
<p>倫敦方面、英首相麥唐納在謁聖協會演說、曾告在座美人、渠歡迎美總統之宣言、認爲卓異之籲請、謂美總統此舉、將爲和平運動史上一偉大之紀念碑、美國旣有此宣言、今後將不復漠視與世界和平有關之事、同時英首相又宣稱、英國雖贊成德國之解除現有限制、第今後之態度、將大半視乎德國之行動、而較少依賴於德國所自承之和平志願也、</p>
<p>莫斯科消息、俄國接到此文全出意外、蓋自革命以來、美國與俄國之直達公文、此猶第一次、政界領袖皆謂美總統此項籲請、直捷了當、適中竅要、歡迎其爲獲致國際諒解之具、更以此舉爲破除向來阻止美俄交換意見障碍之表示、官場多覺欣慰、咸料美俄之復交、將爲指顧間事</p>
<p>羅馬消息、意當道聲稱、意國無條件接受此項提議、蓋意相墨素里尼本認軍縮會議所産生之局勢、爲世界多年未見之最危險之一、且信此時非對於和平有長足之進展、則將見各國陷於極度擾攘之中、</p>
<p>日内瓦軍縮代表則咸讚美總統之膽量與魄力、當德總理希特勒向國會說明德國對於重行武裝之態度前、直接向全世界發保障和平之籲請、逆料美總統之提議、當可緩和德總理之演說、</p>
<p>墨西哥政府發言人今夜聲稱、墨政府將訓令日内瓦代表、在軍縮會議遵循美總統所舉和平原則而贊助其提議、又謂國内經濟狀况目下顯似巳大有進步、果爾、當可使墨國仍留國際聯盟之内、按墨國因會費之負擔過重、本有退出國聯意、</p>
<p>獨法國對於美總統提議似有懷疑意、政府中人雖默無表示、而在野政治家多謂恐無條件接受後、將削弱法國之地位、並認必須德國修改其軍備要求後、法國始可接受此種提議、苟德國不改其軍備要求、則軍縮會議失敗之責、當由德國負之、（十六日國民電）</p>

<p>（東京）　美大總統羅斯福保障和平之親電、今日上午直接到達宮内、齋藤首相與内田外相即請求發下、待與關係各省討論後、將以日政府名義電復、而日政府將採愼重之態度、在由宮中發下前、迴避言明答復之方針、故日外務當局對於羅斯福大總統之提議、於原則的態度、發表如下意見、</p>
<p>英國之軍縮案係歐洲本位、不適用於遠東情形、然日方於審議英國提案之先、將維持先審議日本提議之主張、</p>

<p>軍備之維持現狀、原則上並不反對、但照議定書、維持滿洲之治安、係屬必要、故保留與此之最小限度之準備及擴充之權利、</p>
<p>越過國境之軍事行動、於不可能事無異議、但長城國境日軍之行動、起因於中國之挑戰、並無侵略的性質、如是之防衛行爲、若亦一律加以禁止、則不適於遠東之特殊情形、（十七日電通電）</p>
<p>（東京）　日本陸軍當局對於羅斯福大總統保障和平之親電、大體抱如下之見解、對於美大總統之意見、於原則上並無異議、惟蘇俄之宣傳赤化、與中國之抵貨、爲戰爭時之禍根、而隣接若是國家之日本、若謂日軍不可超越國境等之言辭、實難以承服、而終應認特殊之情形也、又尙有一重要問題、即妨碍非戰條約之所謂自衛權之發動之意味與關係、不能不明白之也、（十七日電通電）</p>

<p>惟除術語方面之見解外、官場及大多數國會議員皆信總統未必立即提出承認問題　因據政府顧問人員言、若此時即行承認、或將反致妨碍世界經濟會議之進行、蓋有數國縱不致認其爲不友好行動、亦將認爲有失禮貌、但信總統已使美代表在倫敦可與蘇俄代表自由交換意見、一如他國代表矣、（十六日國民社電）</p>

<p>（華盛頓）民主共和兩黨皆稱此次宣言書、爲一重要而有力量之文件、但對於其本意解釋互異、政府友人宣稱、總統本意在勸各國捐棄政治爭執、一致擁護倫敦會議、因認此會爲空前未有之最重要國際會議也、</p>
<p>衆議員白禮敦則認此文不啻對於日本當頭一棒、謂總統眞意在勸日本停止對華不正當之侵略戰事、文内雖未提及日本、而不遣武裝隊伍出自己國境、否則將公認爲侵略者一層、實爲此文之骨幹、即係暗對日本而發、白氏以爲總統處理遠東事件、常非常巧妙、故不信此語係對南美交戰國家而發、</p>
<p>更有許多國會議員　連衆議長雷納在内、則信此文對象、以德國爲主、蓋此文係在軍縮會議陷於僵局時發出、但如雷納所稱、總統所提議者乃在成立聯合陣線、以對付從事軍事行動、或有從軍事行動之虞者、德國當然亦在其内等、其眞意所指已在不言中、固未嘗　　　　禮敦之語相參照也、</p>
<p>至羅斯福本人、則信其文已完全明瞭、毋庸再加伸釋、故將原文抄送國會時、僅附一簡短之咨文、指出經濟與政治之安定、今方受自私利益與衝突危險之威脅、力言有減縮軍備與廢棄侵略武器之必要、謂國際間大半糾紛皆由恐懼他人侵略而起、咨文内未請國會加以通過、僅謂備供查照而已、（十六日國民電）</p>

<p>濟中國實業、推廣國貨銷路、故特擬具意見、以供國貨廠商之參考、（一）「外貨傾銷」、歐戰後、各國努力生産、對内則减輕出口稅、奬勵輸出、對外則增加進口稅、使外貨難以輸入、不能與其本國工業競爭、於是生産日益發達、供過於求、在國内市塲、不能容納此過剩之商品、於是爲救濟其經濟恐慌、又不得不向國外尋覓市塲、以容納其過剩之生産品、我國産業落後、人口衆多、爲列强銷貨惟一的大市塲、因此各國爲爭奪此市場獨占權、互相傾銷、我國幼稚之工業、自難與價廉物美之外貨競爭、因此我國貨受莫大之打擊、實業部爲救濟國貨事業、特派員調查外貨在華傾銷情形、然後徴傾銷稅以限制、並用各種方法、預防外貨在華傾銷、（二）「中國没有稅則之保護」、在歐戰未曾發動之前、英國採用自由貿易後、因國外市場對於傾銷之競爭甚烈、故英國即改變方針、放棄自由傾銷計畫、實行保護稅則、對於新興工業竭力提倡、對於國外輸入之新工業品、加以極高之稅、限制其進口、而對於中國方面、因種種條約之束縛、不能與他國相競爭、且中國工業程度、尙在幼稚時期、受此壓迫、更難以有所發展、其救濟辦法、計分（甲）提高進口稅　（乙）本月十五日後、中日關稅業已廢止、進口貨均加以附稅、亦即推銷國貨之良機、（三）「中國國貨、因競爭而自殺」、國内國貨廠家、因同業競爭關係、互相跌價賤賣、因跌價賤賣、廠家利益即减少、即有各種弊病發生、（甲）工廠因虧本倒閉、（乙）繼起之有心工業者、裹足不前、（丙）跌價賤賣、非减低成本不可、故各廠家即偷工減料、因之所出之貨物、失去用者之信仰心　使洋貨有揷足之機會、救濟辦法、分（甲）國貨工廠、應聯合互相監督、使所有出品之貨、其價格與原料及製造有一定之標準、（乙）實業部應有奬勵工業辦法、（四）「國貨與洋貨檢别之困難」（咎在國貨工廠）國貨廠家、因欲利用一般智識淺薄者、專喜購用洋貨之心理、種種出品、用以類似洋貨之標記、或將本國文字、不加其上、因之一般有識階級、或愛用國貨者、反感檢别之困難、救濟辦法、分（甲）應予取締、（乙）凡屬國貨、應將中國之特性表揚之、使國人易於認識（五）「外貨冒充國貨」、外國貨物輸入國内、多數無製造廠家及廠家之標記、或竟改頭換面、魚目混珠、加以中國製造字樣、加上中國商標、使國人不辨眞僞、反使國貨銷塲停滯、此亦國貨不能傾銷之大原因、補救辦法、分（甲）一九三四年起、各國貨物、輸入國内、將加何國何處製造之標記、（乙）或予檢查、檢查關於貨物來源之領事所簽證書、如能依此實行、國貨方能振興、</p>

<p>次由鄔志豪演說云、各位到此地來、應知中國人要買中國貨、華北之所以淪入日人之手、即係外貨傾銷　使日人得有經濟力的操縱權、同時他拿了貨物交換去的金錢、製造槍砲打我、我們想想他們對我，是如何、國人要保持著現有的幸福、應盡力的服用國貨、繼由陳炳輝·王鴻輝·曹志功等相繼演說、詞略、</p>

<p>該會爲使全市民衆明瞭提倡國貨眞諦起見、特於昨午一時在大中華無線電台、請虞仲咸演講國貨救國、原文云、凡一國的人民、用他本國的貨物、是天經地義的責任、世界上無論那一個國家、總没有要少數人來勸多數人用他國内的生産品、所以我們做這種提倡國貨、勸用國貨的運動、簡直是很畸形的一回事、不過造成畸形的原因、有二大部份、第一、國家積弱過甚、門戶開放、外國的貨物無論那一樣、都可入口傾銷、政府因財政困難、想在關稅收入項下多得一些錢、不管進口的東西、與國内生産品、有没有衝突、只知道外國人的進口貨、肯照章完稅、便任他長驅直入、而來和我們國内已有的同等貨物競爭、因此外貨充斥市塲、幷且用傾銷辦法、削輕賣價、來和我拚命、可憐國内很嫩弱的工業基礎、那裏經得起摧殘、以是力量單薄的工業生産品、祗得受他們的摧殘而毁滅、外國的貨物、便可橫行於市、在這一點、唯有希望政府、限制進口外貨、在國内已有同等生産的工業品、至少的限度、把國内已有工業品的同等外貨進口的時候、將關稅征得特别重、使得他進口後、不能再削價傾銷、這是孵育和保障國内工業品的辦法　第</p>

<p>二、數十年來的敎育、也應負一重大過失、因這數十年來的敎育、是崇尙虛浮、不求實際的多、敎育方針、只重表面粉飾、不講内心建設、立身的基本、勤儉則不談、奢靡則是尙、一輩青年、嫌國貨爲土氣、用洋貨算漂亮、尤其是智識份子和姬妾盈庭的富翁、什麽呌國貨、他們眼光裏不屑正視、有智識的和有資産的、總算是上流人、在上者不肯提倡、那國貨的銷路、當在要打折扣、所以負敎育責任的人、應當負起實際責任來潛移默化、訓練青年内心勤儉、勤則便無奢靡思想、儉則不講究土氣不土氣了、我們國家以農立國、但到現在、連民以食爲天的食、亦仰求外貨、米麥進口、每年很多、國内米麥的市價、也操縱在外國米麥進口不進口上面、這危險極了、萬一海口發生障碍、那豈不是國内因糧食不濟而閙恐慌、社會上穿的用的、國入洋貨不少、近年來連吃的食品、亦吃到洋料、但這個問題、要想彌縫補救的方法、是要地方官員負起責來做勸民務農的德政、剷除一切非農産品的耕種、同時使地無荒蕪、一方面産米麥的區域、交通開闢、那末米麥生産充實、不需仰求外貨、民食問題、才能穩定、我們要安居樂業、也非愛用國貨不可、社會上現在的不安寗、和盜匪綁匪的充塞、原因是生産不振、無業可作的人太多、這般無工可作、無業可爲的人、他們祇有二條路走、一條是坐而餓斃、一條是挺而走險、造成社會上危機四伏的現象、就是一部从無業的人走入第二條路所致、我們要减輕我們處身社會上四週的恐怖、便努力服用國貨、使國内工業振興、無業的人、有工可作、人人有業、那社會便能安寗、以前一般人把内憂外患四個字、掛在嘴上、一開口便說、但外患到仕麽田地、這是一個猜象、現在外患的事實、是很顯明的暴露、鄰國日本、把無限制的侵略野心、豺狼式的軍隊、侵入我們腹地、東北四省、完全没落、北平天津亦岌岌可危、大好河山、半壁已去、在這種危急存亡之秋、全國上下、一心振作精神起來、把工業農業軍備政治、件件充實、和上軌道、那目下雖國辱地失、但五年或十年之後、也可收復失地和湔雪國恥、我們人民、惟有團結一致、萬衆一心、來謀一條出路、這便是愛國貨、用國貨、因爲愛國貨、便是愛國家、用國貨、便是維護國内的工業、外國貨便宜到什麽地步、我們不去買他、外國貨漂亮到無可再漂亮、我們也不去用他、因爲金錢不外流、國家的元氣、便不斵喪、那末一切都可充實、我們同時要下决心、抵制日本貨、那日本人現在的耀武揚威、可使他全部消滅、所有的軍艦大砲、都呌他失其效力、日本的金錢、是仰給我們、我們對日經濟、把他長時間封鎖、便可使得他國内混亂、所以我們要挽救我們的國家、惟有不買日本的貨物、是撲滅日本的一條血路、我們要救國、要不做亡國的人民、唯有依靠自己、激發天良、向用國貨的路上去走、我們要撲滅日本、雪國家和自己的恥辱、惟有全國一致、抵制日貨、</p>

<p>俞鴻鈞謂不久將再行晤談</p>
<p>貝爾謂願隨時交涉謀妥協</p>
<p>領團當局否認有折衷辦法</p>
<p>關於租界内工廠檢查問題、以及與此事相關聯之修改洋涇浜章程附則事、其解决之前程、頗爲中外一般人所注意、前日領團會議後、外傳已决定妥善之折衷辦法、新聲社記者、爲欲使社會人士明瞭眞像起見、特於昨日分訪市府秘書長俞鴻鈞、工部局及總董貝爾、以及領團當局三方面、探詢其究竟、茲分誌於下、</p>
<h3 id="c149">市府方面 <a href="#c149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>眞實現象　市政府秘書長俞鴻鈞、昨與新聲社記者晤談時、復申述市政府之態度及現在進行解决中所達到之程度、俞氏謂、市府對此事之態度、已一再申述、頗爲明顯、即市政府認爲檢查工廠、爲極關重要、且屬急不可緩之事實、因此願於不背中國主權之原則下與工部局商訂一妥善之解决辦法、現此事正在磋商之中、費氏久有一書面之意見致市政府、現此項書面之意見、尙未收到俟不久收到後、再行與費信惇晤商、此其最近眞實現象也、至謂使團對洋涇浜章程　已應我國政府要求延期核准事、我方是否確有此項要求、因未接到中央方面報告、故不得而知</p>
<h3 id="c150">工部局方面 <a href="#c150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>表示不滿　新聲社記者、昨訪工部局總董貝爾君於其辦公室、首先詢以報載領團决定　解决工廠檢查問題之折衷辦法、貝氏答以渠不知有此事、且亦不信有此事、蓋以此事現正俟使團之决定也、繼對連日報載各種失實消息、表示不滿之言詞、謂渠不知近日各報所載之種種擴張消息、究何所用意、君試觀西文報紙有如是者乎、余因其所刋者、均不知所云、故亦不重視之也、</p>
<p>未接答復　但貝氏默認領團及使團對解决工廠案、將有一建議、據謂、自將洋涇浜草程附則函領團及使團核准、及現尙未接其答復、現正待使團之决定也、</p>
<p>預商妥協　記者繼詢及交涉方面、貝氏表示、工部局頗願雙方進行談判、以謀得適當解决辦法、交涉之開始、亦不必須等候收到使團之建議、方可進行、雙方儘可隨時磋商、至上星期五俞鴻鈞與費信惇二氏之會晤、是否即係正式談判、抑爲私人接洽、貝氏答謂、此可謂公私各半之接洽、</p>
<p>實行檢查　記者最後詢以工部局實行檢查工廠之期、是否即在本年内、貝代表示、在本年内實行此案、可無疑義、其開始期亦頗近云、貝氏此言、似爲怱促間隨口答復、蓋事實上非經領團及使團將洋涇浜章程附則核准、及與我方商就解决辦法、以及工部局自身對此事有相當之準備、萬難實行、所謂開始期頗近、事實上不能辦到也、</p>
<h3 id="c151">領團方面 <a href="#c151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>否認折衷　記者於昨日往訪工部局總董之前、先往訪晤領團當局、因發言人不允發表其姓名、僅允作官方消息刋載、發言人謂、前日領團之會議、對此問題、僅微有討論、幷無關於此事之任何决定、至報載前日會議、决定由工部局設立檢查處及僱用有經騐之華人爲檢查員等、絕非事實、是日所開者、因係常會、以磋商關於其他問題居多、此外發言人會言使團對此事有一建議、早經連　核准之洋涇浜章程附則、一併送交公使團考慮、尙未得復、别無折衷辦法、至建議之内容如何、則不允吐露云、</p>
<h3 id="c152">實部表示 <a href="#c152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>新聲社駐京記者、昨訪實業部主管當局、詢以交涉公共租界工廠檢查問題、進行狀况、承詳細答復如下、</p>
<p>三原則久决定　過去自二十年國府公布工廠檢查法、實部即準備逐步實施辦法、關於滬市工廠檢查、曾於二十年底、由滬市社會局租界當局及國際勞工專員會議三次、决定原則三項、（一）公共租界與法租界當局、願意接受中國政府所訓練及推舉之工廠檢查員、檢查租界内工廠、前項工廠檢查員、隨時受中央檢查人員監督、（二）租界内檢查員應按時向中國政府及租界當局報告檢查結果及困難、（三）凡市府公共租界之法租界内之工廠檢查員、應每月集合一次、交換意見、協籌改進、此項原則决定後、旋因日領向滬市府提出取締抗日運動、突告停頓、此次納稅西人會忽修正洋涇浜地皮章程附則三十四條、企圖奪取租界工廠檢查權、不但侵害中國主權、即於過去會商結果、似租界當局此舉、未免突兀、</p>
<p>工部局已瞭解　現在自經滬市府向各領提出抗議後、租界當局、對中國主權爭持之聲明、已有相當容納、即由市政府秘書長俞鴻鈞負責與工部局總董費信惇進行磋商、提出前此會議時之備忘錄、與之交涉、至實部前派勞工司科長包國華赴滬、僅爲詳陳意見、供市府初步交涉參考、據包氏回京後、與新聲社駐京記者談、現在市府與工部局正磋商對工廠檢查實施之原則、此時當在進行中、故磋商内容、不能發布、但可得言者、即租界當局、已不如前此之堅持洋涇浜章程附則三十四條、預備執行矣、蓋中國政府所爭持之主權、租界當局亦非常瞭解、故前途頗可樂觀、</p>
<p>外廠尙待磋商　至於檢查工廠在滬市方面、華界一帶、初步檢查之調查工作已竣事、租界内本國工廠之檢查、工部局亦無意見、惟租界内之外國工廠檢查、此時尙成爲磋商目標、實業部對國内外工廠、决不岐視、以工廠檢查之重要、實施檢查、尤爲必要、將來滬市府與租界當局磋商爲相當程度後、正式會商實施檢查辦法時、實部亦將派代表前往出席、</p>
<p>設中央檢查處　至中央工廠檢查處、實業部亦正準備設立、但滬市府工廠檢查之進行、不必待中央工廠檢處成立以後、因滬市社會局早日設有檢查股、一切設備、均可隨時實施也、</p>
<p>京滬當局詳商　滬租界工廠檢查權、我方將合組一會、共同主持檢查事宜、吳市長連日正與外羅實陳等詳商中、</p>

<p>五月十日在青年會演講</p>
<p>各位先生。我想今天人人心裏有一個急迫的問題。需要解答。就是。到底日本將來是否要繼續進攻。還是得了東三省及熱河就算完事。你們記得。在「九一八」瀋陽失陷的時候。有一班苟且偷安眼光近視的人。以爲問題不至於擴大。後來北滿及錦州失了。這班苟且偷安眼光近視的人。又以爲日本得了東三省就算完事。不至於再擴大。後來山海關又失了。這班苟且偷安眼光近視的人。又以爲日本得了山海關。可以保障「滿洲僞國」的安全。就算完事。决不至於再擴大。但是後來熱河又失了。這班苟且偷安眼光近視的人。又以爲日本得了熱河。完成「滿洲僞國」的自然地勢。斷不至於再擴大。更不至於擴大到長城以内。但是現在察哈爾大半已經失了。灤東也已經失了。這班苟且偷安眼光近視的人。還在那裏作夢。以爲日本萬不至於進攻平津。</p>
<p>我自「九一八」事變　生以來。就不敢做夢。更不願把頭埋在沙裏。當作没有看見危險。如鴕鳥一樣。我認定日本必繼續不斷的進攻。理由有三。（一）地勢的連接。日本得了東三省及熱河。必向　南進展。如美國以前向西發展的運動一樣。非橫貫全洲至太平洋岸不止。日本將來也非席捲我全國不可。這是田中的政策。也是　然的趨勢。在日本人看來。遲早總要實現的。（二）保障已得土地的安全。日本必以攻爲守。得了東北必侵略華北。以華北爲緩衝地帶。得了華北。又必侵略長江流域。。以長江流域爲緩衝地帶。得了長江流域。又必侵略華南。等到亡了我全國以後。日本才會心滿意足。高枕而臥。（三）世界大戰雖不會馬上發生。但將來總難倖免。日本知道她自己是遠東的罪魁。更不能不積極準備。本國旣然是地小物貧。便不能不把中國來做她窮兵黷武的根據地。</p>
<p>日本這種繼續不斷的侵略政策。會不會成功呢。須看三方面的情形。（一）要看國際方面會不會積極干涉日本的行動。大家都知道現在是世界經濟恐慌的時期。英美各國忙於整理内部。自德國希特勒上臺以後。歐洲空氣異常緊張。並且各國人民離歐戰不久。大家不願再馬上有第二次世界大戰發生。至於蘇俄。一來因爲國基未固。二來因爲五年計劃没有完成。不但不能扶助弱小民族」。近來反而與我們的仇人勾結。蔑視我國主權。出賣中東鐵路與「滿洲僞國」。故在目前這樣的國際形勢看來。國際方面是不會積極干涉日本的行動的。日本大可以繼續進攻。可以繼續進攻而無恐。（二）要看日本内部會不會發生内訌或革命。如果發生内訌或革命。便可牽制日本的侵略行爲。在苟且偷安奴隷成性的中國人看來。未嘗不是一件日夜所祈禱的事情。但是在日本對華政策一帆風順。勢如破竹之下。日本一般國民歡欣鼓舞慶祝之不暇。那裏會有什麽革命發生。只有遇到中國有力的抵抗。軍事上不得手。戰事範圍日益擴大。人民負擔日益加重。人民才會由不滿與失望轉向到革命之一途。如歐戰中的德國一樣。假使當日的法國是現在的中國。一味不抵抗。那麽德帝國不但不會發生革命。並且基礎會更加鞏固。（三）要看中國抵抗不抵抗。我們大家知道。就是有抵抗。也是局部的抵抗。出於地方軍事長官的愛國熱誠。但是中國愈不抵抗。日本愈　進攻。日本愈是進攻。中國愈不抵抗。於是一年半載。馬馬虎虎。便斷送了半邊天下。反之。如果自始拚命抵抗。日本的侵略政策是不會這樣順利的。也不至於如此急進的。其所以繼續急進。正是因爲我們繼續急退。</p>
<p>但是政府到現在還說是長期抵抗。譬如前不多久。行政院長汪精衛先生爲着和戰問題。特别發了一個很長的電報加以解釋。說「因爲不能戰所以抵抗。因爲不能和所以交涉。是以抵抗與交涉並行」但是我們要問。所謂戰是不是軍力的衝突。如果用軍力去抵抗。是不是戰。難道上海十九路軍的抵抗。不是戰嗎。宋哲元軍在喜峯口的抵抗。不是戰嗎。徐庭瑤軍在古北口的抵抗。不是戰嗎。如果汪先生所謂的抵抗。不是武力的抵抗。乃是不敢應戰的抵抗。那麽這與張學良先生的不抵抗主義。有何分别。至於「因爲不能和所以交涉」。我們更不懂爲什麽明知不能和。而要與日本交涉。交涉是不是希望和。政府這種「兩面政策」（一面抵抗一面交涉）的結果。不但政府三心兩意。拿不住方針。没有計畫。就是我們小百姓。也不知所從。</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<h3 id="c194">論「骨氣」 <a href="#c194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>從×××路×國兵營前走過，碰到了這麽一件事。一個矮胖軍官從裏面出來，街對過五六輛黄包車一齊向他奔去。捷足先得，有兩輛巳經停放在他底脚前。許是因爲看見第二輛車的坐墊要白點兒吧，矮胖子把已經跨上了第一輛車的右脚收回跳上了第二輛。第一個車夫似乎心有不甘，拉住第二個車夫的車把不放。結果的：挨了矮胖子一脚完事。</p>
<p>走在我前面的兩位嶄新「春裝」的紳士發議論了。</p>
<p>「眞是自討没趣！」一個說。</p>
<p>「這些黄包車夫，見了外國人總要搶着拉，挨揍是活該。他們以爲外國人會多給錢丨眞没骨氣丨眞没骨氣丨」另一個似乎更加義憤塡膺，連說了兩句「眞没骨氣。」</p>
<p>我打了一個冷噤。</p>
<p>他竟向黄包車夫要「骨氣」！爲了「人道」而不坐黄包車的某名流，（提起他來；就想起了他底兩句名言：蘇俄醜類，猶太獸種。但這種聲音現在似乎寂然了！）區區早耳其名：但向黄包車夫要「骨氣」的紳士，在我還是創見。一切的紳士們，我想大槪都是與他們抱同樣意見的。</p>
<p>我底意思並不是說黄包車就不應該有骨氣。但在這買辦資産階級統治着一切，所有高等華人與乎學者紳士們都作順民作忠狗的時候，這個寳貝却忿恨黄包車夫没骨氣，眞不能不呌人打冷噤。一輛黄包車一天的車租要十幾角，車夫說不定家裏還有老婆孩子待養活，爲了多拉幾個子兒，他是講不起許多「骨氣」的。如果某名流把他底「不坐黄包車」改爲「坐車多給子兒」，也許要更「人道」點吧。</p>
<p>其實，骨氣這玩意兒在高等華人中間似乎早已絕了種，倒是在黄包車夫一類下等人中間，還存在着一點半點。譬如說罷：他們懂得恨。如果你曾見過上述這車夫在挨了那一脚後面部的表情，見過車夫們駡巡捕時那種咬牙切齒的樣子，你便知道我所謂恨是什麽意思。至于高等華人，他們都只會作順民，作狗。</p>
<h3 id="c195">雨 <a href="#c195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>— 林微音</p>
<p>雖然躺在床上，却只是睡不着，在思念間或中斷的時候，便聽到鐘聲與雨聲的合奏。看到白日的最初的光已從雨絲中擠進來，心中尤其煩擾。眼看不會睡了，索性起了身。</p>
<p>心中好像有很多的話想同一個人談談，接着就有一個可以談談這些話的人進入了心中。於是我便决定了去找那個進入了我心中的人。</p>
<p>他，那個進入了我心中的人，住在一個離城有四十餘分火車路程的村中，在一個學校裏。火車到那里的時候，雨下得並不大。我不想坐洋車，便依着路牌向那學校走去。可是走到學校，帽子已濕透，在忽東忽西地滴着水。太狼狽了，彷彿故意要使主人　難似地，心中似乎有些不安。</p>
<p>好，他不在校，說住在城裏，要下午才有課，請我或者在那里等，或者過一忽兒再去。我感到的並不是失望，却是驚異，因爲我想不到他會不在那里。雖然，到這時，我倒似乎並没有一定要看到他的意思了。因爲我想同他談談的話已完全散失在漫雨中。我想回進城，可是火車要隔一點多鐘才有，於是便到一間靠近車站的老虎灶去喝茶。</p>
<p>那老虎灶面臨一條小河，河端有一座木橋，離橋不遠停着兩三艘帆船。而且，彷彿在伴我的寂寞似地，雨依舊在下着。那雨，那河，那橋，那船，凝成了一輛後退車，把我送進了十四五世紀。　我坐在一張不滿五寸寛的長凳上，在忘我地凝視着這一切。</p>
<h3 id="c196">虹口公園 <a href="#c196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>— 馬國亮</p>
<p>平素不大喜歡到什麽地方走動的，一個月來的足病，整天被逼關在屋裏的結果，使我對於一般能够自由走動的人羨慕起來。病好的那一天，正是星期日，天氣又是那麽好，一個人便向就近的虹口公園跑。</p>
<p>自從發生一二八事件以後，我便不曾到過虹口公園。許多朋友都没到過，據說因爲裏面東洋人太多。不過我以爲這點不能成爲「不進去」的理由。</p>
<p>這也是咱們的土地呢。自己的土地爲什麽不高興去？</p>
<p>交付了兩毛錢，我便被允許走進那「公」園裏去，獨個兒在煤屑路踱着，過了木橋，在草地上走走，在石頭上面歇歇，又在溪邊蹲蹲。雖然是一個人，倒也有另外一番趣味。這兒瞧瞧，那兒跑跑，把旁人當作景物或是戲劇般的看看，儘够你不會感到個人的寂寞。</p>
<p>天氣旣然好，遊人不消說很多。紅的綠的黑的白的全是人，出没在溪邊，樹邊，椅上，和草地上，其中東西洋的，白種的，黄種的，粽色種的……全有。最多的自然還是咱們的同胞和在虹口天天見到的日本人人。</p>
<p>什麽景色都有。兩個西洋人不知是不是在辯論中日問題，大家說到面紅耳熱。兩個印度女人和一個束了白頭巾的男人調情，纏了半天還像没個結局。東洋小孩拿着太陽旗隨處跑，中國孩子老是躱在媽媽或爸爸的旁邊。東洋人在打球，釣魚；中國人在吸烟，散步，談笑，練太極拳。</p>
<p>這裏，是極樂世界，人們都是衣冠楚楚的，擺出了優閑的神情。肚子吃得飽飽，到這裏來散散步，帮助消化，自然是　需的。</p>
<p>這裏，没有「世界經濟恐慌」，没有「第二次大戰爆發」，没有「努力援助前戰將士」，没有「殺盡倭奴」。中國人，東洋人，大家都笑嘻嘻的，並不互相怒目而視。</p>
<p>所以，這裏又可以說是中日親善，共存共榮，甚而是「已」進於大同的世界。</p>
<p>跑了半天路，好容易給我在池邊找到一張椅子。才坐了下去，便看見對岸的一條窄窄的路上，正迎面走着我們同胞的一家大小和東洋人的一家大小。他們都客親地互相側身讓着路。我不禁暗嘆中日果然親善，世界確已大同！幸而今天連報紙也不曾帶到公園裏看，否則看見上面寫着灤河中日在大激戰時，我必定要大駡新聞記者扯謊。</p>
<p>假如新聞記者不曾扯謊，中日兵士眞的還在那兒激戰；假如我們有機會去告訴一個日本兵，說他正在戰塲上拚命時，他的同胞却在咱們敝國的一個公園裏釣魚。你想當他聽到這話的時候，他的槍口該要對那一個人瞄準呢？</p>
<p>記得曾經看見過一幅美國某漫畫家所寫的漫畫，上面題着這樣的字：「戰爭，是由一些不去打仗的人們所慫恿成的……那些不想去打仗的人們却得被迫去打仗！」古今戰爭的因果，大都如是，又何獨日本爲然！</p>
<p>走出了極樂而又大同的世界的園門口　迎頭便看見那正在建築中的宏大的日本兵營，從它前面走過的正是中國勸捐航空救國的童子軍。</p>
<h3 id="c197">飛機與蝸牛競賽 <a href="#c197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>— 克多</p>
<p>現在世界上這個「神秘的」國家丨蘇聯，有許多人們聞所未聞見所未見的奇特花樣。牠自從一九二八年實行五年經濟計畫以後，便實行了一種别開生面的滑稽競賽丨飛機與蝸牛競賽。初聽這話，一定覺得很奇怪的。其實蘇聯並不是眞正實行飛機與蝸牛競賽，這不過是社會主義競賽（ＳocialistＣompetition）成績的標誌。</p>
<p>什麽是社會主義競賽吃？這是列寗的遺訓。他說：「社會主義不但不消滅競賽，反而把競賽放在大衆的基礎上擴大起來，使勞動羣能夠眞正地發揮自已的才能。社會主義實施的今日，我們的功課，就在組織這種競賽」。這種競賽，如今已普及蘇聯全國一切機關；工業企業相互間，企業内的工作場間，突擊隊間（ＳhockＢrigade丨是一九二六年九月列寗格拉「紅三角」工廠一百二十個青年女工所創始的一種新式的身體勞動組織，到一九二九年即成爲普遍全國的羣衆運動），個别的勞動者間，工業企業與農業間，國立農場間，集體農塲間，甚至於蘇維埃，軍隊，學校，醫院，以及託兒所與幼稚園間，都實行了這種競賽。</p>
<p>競賽的方法，是某一個工作塲，企業或國立農塲，對於屬於同類的對方，或其他也可認爲適當的對方，擬定競賽事項，雙方簽訂契約，開始實行競賽，有審查委員會决定勝負，而以飛機，汽車，電車，自行車，烏龜，蝸牛等模型，作爲競賽成績的標誌。工作優良者將廠名記在飛機汽車之上，並發給奬品，以示奬勵；工作惡劣者把廠名記載於烏龜蝸牛之上，作爲恥辱。</p>
<p>實行社會主義競賽的結果如何呢？結果是：五年經濟計劃於四年内完成。在工業方面，生産計劃完成，並超過預定數字，生産成本費减低，勞動率提高，生産品質量改善，怠工及破壞减少，附帶費用減低，在農業方面，播耕面積擴大，耕種方法改善，農村電氣化加速，富農消滅。在各機關方面，辦事人員工作敏捷，官僚主義者肅清。</p>

<p>— ＪulesＫenaru林取作譯</p>
<p>瞎子</p>
<p>他用拐棍的一端輕輕地敲着大門。</p>
<p>雷辟克家的丨他又來做什麽，這傢伙？</p>
<p>雷辟克丨你不知道嗎？他來拿他那六個蘇；這是他來領錢的日子。讓他進來罷。</p>
<p>雷辟克家的一臉不高興的跑去把門開了，因爲外面很冷的緣故，她抓着瞎子的手冐很粗暴地往裏面拖。</p>
<p>「早安，諸位！」瞎子說。</p>
<p>他向裏面走。他的拐棍在那舖地的石板上慢慢移動着，好像趕着鼠子似的，遇到一把椅子了。瞎子坐卜來，把他那雙凍麻了的手伸向火爐。</p>
<p>雷辟克拿出一枚六個蘇的貨幣說道：</p>
<p>「收好！」</p>
<p>他便不再理他；他繼續看他的報。</p>
<p>紅蘿蔔鬚在玩着。他蹲在一個角落裏，瞧着瞎子的木鞋：鞋上的雪在溶解着，周圍已經看得出有一些很小的水道了。</p>
<p>雷辟克家的看到了。</p>
<p>「把你的木鞋借給我罷，老頭兒，」她說。</p>
<p>她把木鞋拿去放在壁爐底下，可是太遲了，地上已留下一亂水，心裏感着不安的瞎子兩脚覺得濕濕的，一會兒提起這隻脚，一會兒提起那隻脚，離去那泥濘的雪水，使得雪水流散得更遠。</p>
<p>紅蘿蔔鬚用指甲刮着地面，好像在把那些較深的隙縫指示給髒水，呌它向自已那方流去。「他旣然已經得到他那六個蘇了，他還坐在這裏做什麽？」雷辟克家的說，也不管瞎子會不會聽見。</p>
<p>可是瞎子在談着政治，起初還吞吞吐吐的，後來便說得更加痛快了。有時話說完了，他便揮着拐棍，把拳頭碰到火爐的烟筒上，灼痛了，連忙收回來，臉上現着疑惑的樣子，兩顆白眼珠在那滿是淚水的眼睛内翻動着。</p>
<p>有時雷辟克把報紙翻過來，說道：</p>
<p>「不錯，狄西葉老爹，不錯，可是你覺得這事十分可靠嗎？」</p>
<p>「你問我是不是覺得這事十分可靠！」瞎子呌起來。「啊，居然有這樣的事情呀，這太利害了！聽我說啦，雷辟克先生，讓我告訴你我是怎樣變成瞎子的。」</p>
<p>「他不會走的，」雷辟克家的說。</p>
<p>確實的，瞎子覺得這裏比外面好些。他訴說着他那意外的遭遇，他舒展四肢，通身溶化了。他的脈管裏面有着一些冰塊在融解着，循流着。他的衣上和四肢好像在滴着油一般。地上那灘泥水漸漸增多了，向紅蘿蔔鬚那方面流去，已經流到了他身邊。</p>
<p>紅蘿蔔鬚便是這灘泥水流注的目標。</p>
<p>一會兒他便可以玩着這灘泥水了。（未完）</p>

<p>人之受桎梏者，以不能自由爲苦，人盡知之。稅則不良，層層留難，此國貨界之痛苦也。此項桎梏一日不去，則國貨事業一日無發展之可言。我國政府最近對於國貨事業，提倡不遺餘力，於國貨界之痛苦，尤知之甚稔。財政與實業當局，亦嘗設法研究，以期抑制外貨之傾銷，减輕國貨界之負擔。最近國貨界亦有懇請政府廢止華商機製貨物轉口稅，幷酌减原料必需品進口稅，增加奢侈普通等品進口稅之提議。已正式呈請政府，予以採納，其大意所在，略爲陳述：查機製洋式貨物，運銷國内，徴收値百抽五正稅一道，不再重徴辦法，始自遜清之季，當時原爲奬勵國人自營新式工業，俾所仿製之洋式貨物，得與洋貨一體享受一貨一稅之同樣權利，而免厘金重徴疊稅之痛苦，用意原極周摯。惟是國内工業幼稚，商力微薄，對於此項稅則，實屬不勝負荷，民國成立後，華北各工廠，屢次籲請廢止，均以稅收方面，尙無抵補辦法，迄未照准。嗣於民國十三年，復又增加附稅百分之二，五，合之正稅，共爲百分之七，五，負擔愈重，痛苦益深。迨國府南遷，關稅自主，抵補有方，全國厘金及與厘金類似之各種通過稅，均已一律裁撤，惟此項機製洋式貨物之轉口稅，仍照舊徴收，未邀豁免。查轉口稅之性質，完全係國内通過稅，實屬厘金之一種，理應與厘金及海關所徴收之子口稅復轉口稅等各種稅制，同時廢止，今則子口稅業已廢止，而機製洋式貨物轉口稅，依然存在。從前洋貨運品内地，因有子口稅之束縛，是以國貨尙能勉强支持，自洋貨子口稅之束縛一旦解除，遂使國貨驟失保障。而此項昔時因奬勵本國工業而設之機製洋式貨物稅制，降至今日，轉爲本國工業發展之障碍，洋貨因得乘勢壓迫，莫能與競。頻年以來，全國工廠由縮小範圍，以至停頓閉歇，各廠工人由减少工作，以至全體解僱者，日有所聞。人謂今年國貨年，轉變爲外貨暢銷年，痛心實甚。各國貨工廠如此痛苦情形，政府當早鑒及。嘗以此項稅制之未能與厘金同時裁撤者，當係由於政府以國庫收入爲慮，未能遽行放棄，惟嗣後關稅業經兩次增加，各項統稅，亦已次第舉辦，而此項轉口稅，迄仍遷延未裁，坐使全國國貨工業日趨衰落，似與政府歷次宣言維護工業之旨相背馳。現在中政會議已議决於本年五月間改訂稅則，竊以爲此實我國解除全國工商痛苦，實施保護關稅政策之最好時機。希望政府念及全國工業之瀕於危殆，毅然將此項類似厘金之機製洋式貨物轉口稅，立予廢止，以維工業，而蘇商困。至此項稅制廢止以後，如歷次增加關稅，及興辦統稅之所收入，尙有不足抵補之處，似可酌增洋貨進口稅，以資挹注。方今我國關稅主權旣已恢復，當此重行改訂稅則之際，正値世界各國增高關稅壁壘之時，允宜乘機增課進口稅，藉紓國用，凡進口洋貨奢侈品及普通品稅率，擬請分别酌量增加，關於本國工業上所缺乏而必需仰給外國之原料品進口稅，則擬請酌減免，其我國已能自製無待外求之原料品，亦請一律境加稅率，不在上項減免之列，以符保護關稅之本旨，如此一轉移間，國庫收入，有盈無絀，而全國工廠及勞工胥獲救濟，此項懇切之意見，實爲國貨界一線之目標。希望政府於議訂稅則時，儘量采納，並准許國貨工業團體推派代表列席參加，以備諮詢，國貨界之生死關頭，胥在於此，想政府當局爲維持工業一線生機起見，定有以慰我全國工商界喁喁之望也。</p>
<p>國貨談話</p>
<h3 id="c202">從國貨聲中說到兒童玩具 <a href="#c202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>— 黄家福</p>
<p>在産業落後的中國，關於國民的日用所需，向來仰給於舶來品，因此我國利源外溢，經濟瀕於破産，政治不上軌道，内亂歲歲，外禍年年，國將不國，言之多麽痛心！及今而後，我們如果不思救國則已，要思救國，那麽「提倡國貨挽回利源」，確是釜底抽薪的要圖。不過空喊着「國貨救國」的口號，還是不中用的，必須將國貨原有的改良起來，没有的提倡起來，使一切的貨物，合於國民的需要，切於國民的實用，那麽國民便能不買外貨而惟國貨是趨了。</p>
<p>我國的兒童玩具，尤多購自外國，此項損失，目前雖没有統計，要亦爲數不貲的。幷且兒童爲未來國家的主人，關於他們的玩具，更應提倡改良，迎合他們的心理，切於他們的玩用，使他們樂於購用，養成他們愛用國貨的習慣，啓發他們愛擁國家的思想，在此國貨聲中，更屬必要。因就管見所及，將兒童玩具應具的條件，略陳如左：</p>
<p>（一）須含有敎育價値的。</p>
<p>（二）須合於兒童衛生的。</p>
<p>（三）須形式美觀質料堅固的。</p>
<p>（四）須合於經濟的原則的。</p>
<p>（五）須有多方面的活動的。</p>
<p>（六）須有團體性的使用的。</p>
<p>（七）須没有危險性的。</p>
<p>（八）須没有賭博性的。</p>
<h3 id="c203">目標 <a href="#c203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>— 柯定盦</p>
<p>在一般醉生夢死的朋友看來，這：「目標」二字，是很不需要的，因爲他們的生活，是隨隨便便，得過且過，本無須乎：「目標」。可是一般清醒而有作爲的人們，無論什麽事情，總須得先定一個目標，再依照這個目標做去，那纔步步上軌，得有成功的一天。</p>
<p>當今是個什麽時代？須先認清！外侮不可說是不緊迫，内訌不可說是不劇烈，在這緊要關頭，迎前的大問題，是什麽最切要？切要的問題，當然是很多很多！如防空的設備，軍械的充實，民衆的團結，政見的一致……等，都是切要的問題：但是我以爲最最切要的問題，還是：「服用國貨」來得比較重要！</p>
<p>「服用國貨」是全國民衆一致可以實行的，輕而易舉，是比較旁的一切問題容易解决。舉凡人生日用一切之所需，在在都可以向「服用國貨」一方面進行。</p>
<p>不過在外貨充斥各省各鄕的我國，受了差不多有幾十年融化的一般民衆，雖然也曾演過十多年的：「提倡國貨」幻劇，可是漠然無動於中的却還是很多很多，假使在那民四，二十一條相逼的時候，全國民衆，依照了：「萬衆一心，抵制×貨。」一直到現在有十幾年的悠久歷史，我想許多歷史上的汚蹟，一個也不會成立，就是最近九一八·一二八的悲劇，也絕端不會發生。這是什麽原故？我想並不離奇，也並不複雜，這就是一般民衆，對於當初的：「提倡國貨，抵制日貨」。没有確切目標去力行的大病。假使在民四那時候，眞個「萬衆一心」地實行起來，我想到現在的成績，一定不會差呢！</p>
<p>事實展開在我們眼前，這種空口喊着：「提倡國貨，抵制劣貨。」的成績是等於零，非但無補實際，而且還不能敷衍暫時的局面。這除了起來力行之外，還有什麽辦法？</p>
<p>在歐化到極點的上海，也曾吃到一次外侮的苦痛：但是一般：「腰纏萬貫」的富豪們，有他們好保衛，金錢。當然受不到什麽痛苦，可是至少也把他們的腦筋抽搐一下。</p>
<p>大砲的轟轟聲，機槍的迫迫聲，當然已成爲過去，而我們的購買×貨，也依然恢復了常度！據海關最近的報告，以×貨棉布一項而論，在一二兩個月之中，竟超出八十四萬餘金單位的大數目，這確實是一個：「驚天動地，涕鬼泣神」，的惡劣消息！</p>
<p>這惡劣消息的造成，無可推辭的是我們一般民衆了！我們的民衆啊，却無論誰也不肯直捷了當的承認這個罪名，也就是無論誰也不能卸却這重大罪名的頂戴！</p>
<h3 id="c204">兒童與國貨時裝 <a href="#c204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>— 張孟昭</p>
<p>充滿洋化式時裝的都市裏面，要想推廣國貨時裝的盛行，是一件很不容易的事，所謂一般摩豋女子，衣，食，住，行，四者，不崇拜歐化，不能被人稱譽爲摩豋，爲時髦，雖然是十元一尺外國綢，她是毫無顧慮，可以媚惑丈夫和情人，去逼着他竭澤而漁，要希望她們去實行國布時裝，簡直是與虎謀皮，我以爲要推廣國貨時裝，先要從男女兒童做起，父兄們常帶子女到國貨公司去走走，引起他們愛好國貨時裝的興趣，國貨二字，從小會深印在腦海裏，可以說：必有意想不到的效力，我的四歲次兒昌鴻，前天帶了他到三友社去買衣服，去的時候，身上穿的是紅縐洋裝，艶麗奪目，可是拿國貨公司的國布西裝，和他身上一罩，他馬上要棄掉那套紅縐洋裝，換上國貨時裝，我倆允許他換好之後，天眞爛熳，精神格外來得活潑，小小心靈中，也顯得非常愉快，費銀不過一元，所以兒童與國貨時裝，好似電力和馬達啊！</p>
<p>我以爲：「以前譬如昨日死，以後譬如今日生。」今後認清了目標，力行看：「服用國貨」的這一句話，「萬衆一心」的行去，舉凡衣，食，住，行的一切所需，都取用於國貨，不再處行其事仍自已騙自已，一方面海關進口，日見其少，一方面國内生産力，日見其增，那麽一般以經濟侵略的自負者，覺到竭蹶而竟至消亡，那時候：國内的經濟充實，民生富裕，失業無人，工廠林立，那統不失數千年歷史，數千年文明的中華民國的風度。這個偉大的基礎，却完全樹立在：「目標」二字的上面。</p>
<p>國貨討論</p>
<h3 id="c205">對於中國國貨公司之新希望 <a href="#c205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>— 吳中凡</p>
<p>中國國貨公司成立數月，營業之盛，爲各大商場向　未有，足徴國人之愛用國貨，與夫公司之竭誠提倡，實不遺餘力也。惟參觀内部，尙覺有未盡善者四端，特縷述於後，以期公司有所改進焉。</p>
<p>（一）標價切實　入門登樓時，即見有白布一方，懸於墻上，上書各貨價格，自幾角幾分起碼，但購買時徧覓該價之貨色，始終未能尋得，似失顧客之信任。</p>
<p>（二）售價從廉　年來經濟衰落，銀錢維艱，普通人民購貨之心理，咸趨集於價廉物品，凡市上之减價商店，莫不門庭如市，若該公司之貨價，能較他店再廉，以廣招徠，則對於國貨之宣傳，收</p>
<p>効必大，即公司之資金，亦易於流轉也。</p>
<p>（三）擴張商塲　内部之地位，過於狹小，顧客若三五成羣，往來其中，即有擁擠之患，非獨減少顧客之興趣，即陳列之貨品，亦易於損害，聞現已添闢南部，希望早早實現。</p>
<p>（四）印送國貨手册　近來國貨之製造日新月異，出品之數量亦逐漸增多，惜國人未能盡知，仍購外貨者爲數不少，若公司能編製國貨手册，載明商品及其製造之工塲，贈予顧客，雖耗極低之費用，其於國貨之銷路，必能推廣，公司之營業，更有盛於今日矣。</p>

<p>丨「自强呢」與「駱駝羢」丨</p>
<p>弗論那樣織物，總以經久耐用爲主；就是要質料堅固，顔色不變。反之，即非頂刮刮的道地貨，而成了俗語所謂蹩脚貨：蹩脚貨，怎樣會受社會的歡迎，以期暢銷無阻？然而目今我們中國的各種機織産物，輒因粗製濫造，不事精求，不免患着蹩脚二字之毛病：而「自强呢」和「駱駝羢，」即是一個顯著的證明！現在特别把牠提出談談，藉以促起廠方的注意。</p>
<p>新機器介紹</p>
<h3 id="c207">兩件國貨機器 <a href="#c207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>— 枕木</p>
<p>▲加减乘除計算機丨丨此機爲常熟錢景華先生所發明製造；利用齒輪之旋轉，以手搖計算數目，該機外觀頗爲小巧，佔體積僅二十七分之二立方尺，携帶便利，式樣合宜；全機共分三大部，爲實數，法數，與得數；實數法數之兩圓　上，可有九位數目排列，答數機上則可有十五位之多。此種計算機在外國本已流行甚廣，而吾國則以此爲先，據記者觀來，此機之組織，較之外貨，更形進步，若數目之可以自由安放改正，撥進退落，單位之可以隨意指定記認，小數分數，進位之動作敏捷，搖轉之方法輕便，等項好處。</p>
<p>▲環象攝影機丨丨是機亦爲錢先生所發明；平常各照相館所用之外貨旋轉攝影器，重至十七八斤，舉者手爲之酸，而裝合之機關又極愚笨，現在此國貨機則連鏡箱帶轉盤不及十斤之重，而快門對光之裝置，轉盤重心之配搭，均極合科學原理，速率之　宜，距離之準確，尤爲外貨所不及，是誠國産機械事業之佼佼者，足爲國人所當倡用而宣傳之。</p>
<p>現在吾國的國貨事業，除眞正土産外，大半皆從事於化妝品等類之努力，而對於是類之機械工業，以其事倍而收效難，努力者於是亦稀；以上兩機之發明者錢先生，克勤克儉，開始研究於二十年前，躬自操作，卽微至直徑一耗之小螺絲釘，亦自己車製，故該兩項機件誠不愧爲完全國産。但成功至今，銷行未及五年，徒以缺少宣傳，國人知者甚鮮，而發明者復不計名利，努力改進，且商人大半信仰笨重不靈之外貨，而卑視國産，願購一二千元之外貨，而不思買此六七百元之國産，是以銷路尙未推廣；要知是兩項機件，實爲精製，非但國産之特品，且該二機者，已經美國政府之註册專利，而亦有運往銷售者，願吾同胞齊起倡用，以挽利權。</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>「自强呢」又名「國貨維也納」，原屬一種布類，據說牠的組織，是絲經紗緯，係用繅賸下來的絲頭連繫而成：所以布面有很多細結，彷彿「綿綢」，在新的時候，頗稱美觀。可惜顔色太不濟事，莫說單衣一經洗濯，就得减褪：即棉夾衣服，略受太陽光的曬射，也就轉變。馴至越變越壞，竟壞得像箱角落裏尋出來的破舊東西，多麽難看！</p>
<p>「駱駝羢，」牠的價値果然比外貨便宜，花色亦不讓外貨！不過效用却是差得太遠；因爲質地甚鬆，穿到身上，不消數日，羢頭馬上會起棉花一般的作用，而一縷縷變成綹子；只此一層，已於觀瞻欠雅。何况還要慢慢地脫落下來，羢頭一光。自無溫暖可講！</p>
<p>上面所陳，都是絕大缺點！這並非有心吹毛求疵，祗因記者也是擁護國貨者之一人，故而不得不爲善意的忠告！希望出産這兩種織物的廠方，迅將前項缺點，加以彌補，俾臻完美！才能商場角逐，足與外貨抗衡！萬一忠言逆耳，故步自對；則國貨前途，那裹還有振興的一日呢？</p>

<p>— 趙鵬</p>
<p>自從日人佔我東北以來，對我國貨極爲注意，凡由上海漢口天津各地運往貨物，認爲外貨，一律抽重稅，日貨與洋貨一律免征，因此日貨價格比國貨低十分之六。</p>
<p>自辦的工廠，日人一再派員來檢查，並且每月要抽其全部營業百分之廿五的營業稅，如果二月以上不繳，即行封閉，没收店内一切財産。</p>
<p>從前綢緞土布絲織品棉織品暢銷在東北的，現在日人一面命令海關禁止入口，一面儘量將日本的毛葛，華絲葛，洋布，儘量運到東北，代替我們絲織品棉織品，因此我們中國的絲織品棉織品在東北完全絕跡，幾千家的商號，都相繼關閉了，不少的南方商人，都停業南下。</p>
<h3 id="c209">我嫂嫂的經騐 <a href="#c209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>— 伊麗</p>
<p>女人的衣裝，我們相信不僅僅有關儀容和衛生；就是家庭裏的經濟，也有深切而鉅大的關係。</p>
<p>我們也無　諱言，女子的心理，在服裝方面的注意和體念，是比男子要深切到幾十百倍；因爲愛美的本性隨時可以促使她研究，如何可以增加她格外美麗。服裝，當然是第一要件，而裁製的適宜，與選擇衣料，尤其是她們日常生活中一大部份。假使她的父兄，或她的丈夫，不是一個富裕者，那才容易發生一種不能滿足慾望的苦悶。</p>
<p>總明的姑娘，和賢良的妻子，固然有時也能殺克制自己的慾望，顧慮到家庭的經濟，不常常添製衣服；但是，這樣的女子，的確比較是少數。</p>
<p>尤其是年青的姑娘，在花一般的黄金時代，假使没有美麗的時裝，給她穿御，眞是一件缺憾。在上海或鄰近上海的内地，一輩姑娘，爲了服裝而受到重大的損失，嚴重的敎訓，已是狼顯明的了。她們的缺點，便因爲對於時裝的體念，還不曾明瞭，第一，她們不會自己裁製；第二，自己不會創造；第三，她們不懂怎樣選擇衣料，她們只知道請敎於裁縫匠，只知道買貴重的舶來品，只知道模仿别人所創造的式樣。件件衣服要買舶來品與請敎裁縫，自然非常不經濟而且是不便利。</p>
<p>我哥哥新近娶了一位聰明的嫂嫂，她生得果然美麗，但是也不能算十分怎樣美麗，她穿的衣服，不但入時，而且時常有新的樣子，許多親戚朋友都稱贊她是一位時裝專家，我不狠相信吾哥哥有這許多錢，供給她化在服裝方面，也不曾瞧見過有裁縫司務到我們家裏來，是送新衣給她。</p>
<p>我們相處得比較熟了一些，我便提出這疑點，用很適當的話去問她，並且留心偵察她，才知道她每天晚上，她是躱在自己房裏，用心的自己縫袵，所以她能運用她聰明創造各種不同樣的時裝。</p>
<p>她還告訴我：女子服裝的美不美，不全在衣料，却在裁製的是否適意，往往一般衣料，多餘的零頭，（不論是幅裏剪剩，或長度所餘，）仔細地留藏着。有時裁製别的衣服，也可以拿來應用着。舶來品太貴，自然揀選國貨。例如：現在夏季的衣料，雙縐和喬其紗，本國貨如美亞織綢廠出品也很多；而且新花樣也層出不窮，只要自己去揀，那一種花樣適宜於自己的環境，適宜於自己的年齡自裁和皮色，買來自己製裁，那就得了。</p>
<p>現在上海的通例，買一件衣料的錢或者還不十分貴（除非是買奢華的舶來品）但是裁製的工錢却很大；或者竟比衣料還貴。那才會影響到家庭的經濟了。</p>
<p>所以要穿時裝，第一要先學會裁製那才最好；否則呢，最低限度，必須買國貨，而國貨綢縐以大陸商塲中國國貨公司爲最可靠，且價格最相宜。據我嫂嫂的經騐，買舶來品的喬其紗製一件旗袍，假使交裁縫司務裁製，和買美亞廠喬其紗而自己裁製，所用的錢，自三與一之比；換句話說，假使買外國貨衣料而不自行裁製，只榖穿一件，用同樣的錢如買國貨衣料而自行裁製，便有三件可穿，這不是很經濟的麽？</p>
<p>時裝的式樣，變化得很快，如果時常要穿時裝，却十分不經濟；與其化了一筆錢只能穿一件，那麽何妨穿三件？</p>

<p>浙江舊嘉屬六縣抗日救國會，開第二次聯席會議時，請上海國貨工廠聯合會所屬會員，前往各縣開國貨流動展覽會，於三月七日起，由嘉善而嘉興，由嘉興而海鹽，由海鹽而平湖，參觀者均甚踴躍，足徴提倡國貨之心理，已普遍民衆。嘉善嘉興海鹽三處開幕時，籌成因事不克離滬，未能參與盛典，前日平湖開幕時，曾抽暇前往，爰將見聞所及，記錄如下：陳列處附設臨時商塲於中山公園，該地俗名湖墩，向在東湖之中，現一面築橋以通大街，三面臨水，風景絕佳，開幕時借新民大戲院，到各機關各團體代表頗多，兩旁貼有極觸目之揷畫，一曰「勿忘九一八」，繪日兵蹂躪東三省慘狀，題有「倭兵倭兵，眞狼心，傾其海陸空軍，想把我中華國土整個兒吞一等語。一曰「雪恥復仇」，繪越王勾踐臥薪嘗胆情形，題有「三年被放還，臥薪懸胆嘗，嘗胆豈不苦，臥薪膚爲傷，用誌會稽恥，永永不能忘，廿年如一刻，圖自强，終於治吳國，雪恥意自揚」等語。觀衆對之莫不感奮，主席俞品璋致開會詞，謂過去的我國人民，屢受帝國主義經濟的摧殘壓抑，曾有好幾次抵制外貨運動，同時高呼提倡國貨，起初莫不風起雲湧，厥後事過境遷，熱情敵愾逐漸低降，而烟消雲散，徒受外人譏誚，所以今後提倡國貨，不可徒事</p>

<p>— 曼彬</p>
<p>商標爲商品之標識，商品有信用，則人一望商標，購辦物品，卽了無疑義。俗諺謂老牌子，卽以牌子具有無上之價値也。吾國從前商標，不出天官，壽星，和合，八仙，四喜，吉祥，如意等名稱，層層相因，易於混淆。最近國貨事業，日就發展，國産品亦日多，對於商標之專用，亦日見注意。政府旣設專局以主其事，工廠更視商品爲全廠之唯一生命。故商標問題，已引起社會上一致之注意，且覺一極有趣味之問題。以言商標之特色，則五花八門，奇奇怪怪，極匠心巧思之能事。以吾所見，商標以簡單易記爲第一。三友之三角，中國之三星，何等乾脆簡潔。取材諧聲，亦饒趣味。無敵之蝴蝶，五和之五鵝，是其例也，取材動物，則有立鶴飛虎，有飛馬，有狗頭等。取材植物，則有墨菊，有萬年青等。神仙則有嫦娥，鬼怪則有鍾馗，應有盡有，各廠當局之用心如此，可敬可佩，雖然，商標死物也，商品亦不活動者也，欲商品之行銷，全仗製造之精進，而有信用。不粗製濫造，不偷工减料，則信譽日佳，任何商標，可不脛而走也。</p>
<p>宣傳，應有實際工作，共謀産業發達，最低限度，應達到下列基本條件，（一）打破迷信外貨的劣性，（二）養成愛用國貨的習慣，現在兇橫頑强的日本帝國主義者，已奪取我土地，正在進一步的圖滅我們的民族，我們要雪恥復仇，挽回國運，惟有永久的對日經濟絕交，一致提倡國貨。縣政府代表沈孟養，詳述逐年入超情形。縣黨部代表楊造時，謂平湖以前之提倡國貨運動，多從文字或口頭上做功夫，是抽象的，此次請滬杭各國貨工廠將出品帶來陳列，係破天荒，是實做的。縣基幹隊代表樊禮明演說，請販賣者以後摒棄外貨而售國貨，生産者悉心研究，俾國貨精益求精而勝於舶來，最後國貨聯合會馬濟生代表全體廠商致答詞，極一時之盛云。</p>
<p>訪問記</p>
<h3 id="c213">胡西園君 <a href="#c213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>— 嶽雲</p>
<p>凡是辦實業的人，都値得景仰，尤其是在生産落後的我國。</p>
<p>辦實業須要具有下列的幾種條件，方能獲到相當的成功，那幾種呢？就是：（一）忍勞耐苦。（二）不惜犧牲。（三）雄厚資本。（四）至公無我。（五）遠大眼光。</p>
<p>惟其能忍勞耐苦，所以遇到狂風駭浪的時候，能夠安然穩渡，惟其肯不惜犧牲，所以在明明知道要虧本的時候，還是努力奮鬥，引起一般人的信仰，有雄厚的資本，才能夠繼續地和洋貨相競爭，有至公無我的精神，方能和人同甘苦，眼光遠大，自不會粗製濫造，貪圖一時的利益，我國辦實業的人，能夠備具這幾種條件的，决没有不成功。</p>
<p>胡西園君創辦的中國亞浦耳電器廠，聽說從開辦到現在，不知經過了多少次的風浪，外貨的傾銷，和同業的傾軋，都能夠平穩地過去，這不能不歸功於胡君的毅力。</p>
<p>我因爲中國亞浦耳電器廠，在目前的國貨界中，頗有相當的地位，同時，聞到友好的傳說，對於這位胡君也有了相當的認識，所以毅然前往訪問。胡君藹然的容貌，誠摯的態度，侃侃然告訴我以中國亞浦耳電器廠的經過歷史，如民國十四年開辦，由數萬的資本，加到十萬，再加到二十萬，三十萬，現在已經五十萬了，由三間兩廂的普通民房，擴充到買地皮造成玻璃部，燈泡部，和電機部的新式廠房，其間雖然經歷着幾次的風浪，都是抱定沉着的態度，相機應付了過去，他没有驕矜之氣，也没有慨歎的話，總是很和藹地微笑着。</p>
<p>他引導我去參觀玻璃部，爐火炎炎，幾十工人正在挑料的挑料，吹泡的吹泡，工作很是敏捷，到了燈泡部，男女工人，約在二百以外，在這裏，除了機器軋軋之外，簡直寂靜無聲，有裝鈎的，有綳絲的，有排氣的，都是分工合作，末了到電機部，在楊樹浦的鄱陽路，那裏四面田野，空氣很好，工人約一百名，分鉗工，車工，漆工，裝配，等幾組，工作很是緊張，原來風扇快要當令了。</p>
<p>訪問歸來，對於胡先生的爲人，我武斷地下了兩個字的評語，就是「誠懇」對於亞浦耳電器廠，却有十六個字來評他，就是「人才濟濟。設備周詳。努力製造。出品精良」。</p>

<h3 id="c214">愧煞中國電影明星 <a href="#c214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>— 競存</p>
<p>上月某日本報的電影專刋上，登載着一段熱女郎克萊拉寳在歐洲的生活片段，我不避抄襲的罪名，抄襲一次。</p>
<p>克萊拉寳愛國熱誠</p>
<p>「克萊拉寳和她的丈夫游歷歐洲，現已一月多。據歐洲傳來消息，克萊拉寳到歐之後，其平日所用一切物品，除食料之外，雖一襲内衣亦未嘗購買。至不得已時，亦必向商店購美國出品。克萊拉寳在未起程前預先在美國製就衣服甚多，約値價八千餘金元，所以在巴黎雖然天天改變衣服的式樣，尙能不感缺乏。巴黎各巨商在克萊拉寳未抵歐洲時，本預料此次必有一番好生意做，殊不料克萊拉寳抱定非美國貨品不買的宗旨，一般人眞覺得出人意料之外。然而法國商人對於克萊拉寳的愛國心，並不因爲没有好生意而怨恨，並且很尊敬克萊拉寳。」看了這一則消息，不禁使我汗顔無地，克萊拉寳是全世界聞名的影星。她雖然他的祖國，賺了不少外國人的金錢，然而這次她到歐洲，巴黎的巨商，滿希望賺到她一些裝飾費，然而他們却失望了，克萊拉寳雖一襲内衣亦未購買，遑論其他的珍飾，新裝，然而法國商人幷不以做不到她的生意而怨恨她，反因做不到她的生意而尊敬她，尊敬她甚麽呢？尊敬她雖成明星，而仍不忘購用國貨。</p>
<p>我看了這一段消息，爲什麽汗顔無地呢？你想，中國的電影明星，有没有一個獲得了世界的榮譽？儘管有無聊文人的捧塲，然而她們的藝術，她們的言行，似乎尙不能引起我們的尊崇欽佩。電影的藝術我是外行，姑且不論，電影救國的成績如何，我們尙不曾看到，然而報紙上每天有全張的大廣告，幷且電影明星親筆的簽名爲洋貨宣傳，爲洋貨證明。電影明星不愧爲洋商盡責的忠僕，自己服用洋貨，還要勸一般國民也服用洋貨，我想，假使克萊拉寳到了上海，看見了這種現象，一定要說「呸，這也呌做明星？」我想中國的明星眞要愧煞！</p>
<h3 id="c215">咄咄怪事 <a href="#c215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>我是在大中華國貨玩具廠裏長成的一個不倒翁，我的老子也是中國人，我的媽媽也是中國人，算起來，我委實是一個不折不扣的黄帝子孫：但是，當我在廠裏長成完全之後，不到半個月，就給我們的廠主將我們弟兄四五百人一起送到了一家七八層樓高的大公司裏去，讓我們安歇在一架大玻璃櫉裏。</p>
<p>過了幾天，忽然又來了一隊面貌和我們差不多的不倒翁，我暗暗注意他們的背上，一瞧刻的也是「中華國貨」四個字，我以爲總是我們的同胞了，便過去和他們招呼起來，不料他們都聽不懂我的話，而他們說的，我也一個字都不懂；最使我奇怪的便是他們所說的話旣不是廣東話，也不是福建話，竟有些像東洋話。</p>
<p>後來，他們中間有一個會說中國話的便悄悄地告訴我道；「老實說，我們都是日本來的，不料一到上海，就有你們貴國的商人在我們背上刻上了「中華國貨」四個字，連我也不知道是什麽緣故？」</p>
<p>我聽了他的話，正在莫明其妙地出神的當兒，外面恰巧來了一個主顧，伙計先生忙堆着笑招待。</p>
<p>「你愛買國貨的玩具嗎？很好，這是道道地地的國貨！」主顧先表示要買一個國貨的不倒翁，伙計便不住口的答應，可是他伸手進來，却故意揀了一個日本來的假國貨出去。</p>
<p>「先生，你瞧這是多麽好啊，價錢又便宜，比另外一種便宜一半！」伙計一陣鬼掇，主顧便上當了，很滿意地付了錢，帶着那冒牌的國貨走了。</p>
<p>「嘻嘻…………。」伙計得意忘形地笑着，我恨得滿肚子都是火，可惜我有手不能動，不然我一定賞他一記耳光。</p>

<p>— 瞻廬</p>
<p>賢母良妻和豔母亮妻</p>
<p>凶度的偉人，當然是甘地無疑了；中國有甘地這般的偉人麽？没有。中國的偉人，是苦天主義，不是甘地主義。記得某偉人談話裏面，有一句一苦命的中國人一，這便是替中國人呌苦連天，簡單言之，便是提倡着一種苦天主義。然而，人人抱了苦天主義，倒也有苦盡甘來的可能性。可惜打仗的地方，是人人抱着苦天主義；偷安的地方，又人人抱着樂天主義；苦者自苦，樂者自樂，所以會得造成這般的現象。</p>
<p>東洋的女學，未脫賢母良妻主義；有人說：賢母良妻主義，便是奴隷主義，我們中國的女學，是超過這主義，不僅注重於賢母良妻四字。然而，近來的女學，往往不注重賢母良妻，而注重於音同字異的豔母亮妻。分明已做了母親，把孩子交付奶媽去管，自己穿的花花綠綠去上跳舞塲，這便是豔母主義。分明已做了主婦，甚麽都不管，只在漂亮卜用功夫；衣食住行，無一不漂亮。只希望人家稱讚伊一聲漂亮夫人，比着稱　伊一聲大賢大德夫人還得心滿意足，這便呌做亮妻主義。</p>
<h3 id="c274">使之不能生育 <a href="#c274" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e274" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">274</a></h3>
<p>— 百合</p>
<p>前幾天，各報上都登着德國來的「新聞」說，國社黨爲改良種族起見，將訂新法律，使刑事犯，及身體，精神不健全者，不能生育。</p>
<p>所謂「不能生育」也者，究竟是怎麽一回事，電文太略，我們也不便懸揣，想來下回當有分解。</p>
<p>我國帝王之家，三十六宮，七十二院，藏着無數「終生不得一御」的「皇家姨太太」。於是凡在宮裏當値的男僕，一律須割掉那「話兒」，以防乾柴遇烈火。這種「失勢」朋友，呌做太監。不知德國想「使之不能生育」，是否將採用這千穩萬妥，外加人道，而且根本解决的「閹」法。</p>
<p>究竟不知是不謀而合呢，還是德國人在那裏模仿東方文明。因爲在中國歷史上，有一位牛馬走太史，做着一手好文章，却惱怒了愛吃馬屁，直言必怪的不長進萬歲，也像德國人所說的「使之不能生育」，免得「龍生龍，鳳生鳳，賊養兒子掘壁洞」的傳下劃一不二的小太史公來搗蛋。</p>
<p>萬一這法律一旦實行了，那麽，打從監獄裏釋出的囚犯，以及醫院裏的病人，將一個個「大勢去矣」。從此柏林「太監滿街走，」倒好要子。從此「坐懷不亂」，不能讓柳下惠專利了。</p>
<p>食，色，性也，女人和麵包，對於人生，正是一個半斤，一個八兩。大家怕這一手，於是兢兢戰戰，不敢幹觸犯刑法，有害健康的勾當。這便是改良種族的大道理。說得明白些。譬如「隨地吐痰」，「隨處小便，」便要「使之不能生育」，那麽，誰還敢「隨地吐痰」，「隨處小便」？誰還會把「華人」與「狗」聯在一起？</p>
<p>有人躭憂着中國要學樣。我說，儘請放心，中國正有人替囚犯打算解决性慾問題咧。</p>

<p>甘積之和楊家老姑娘，在乳茶店裏這一種密會，自己料着很是安全的，不料偏偏的，頂頭遇着了兄長厚之。不用說，自己和老姑娘說的那一番言語，完全是讓兄長聽去了。無疑的，兄長必定要大大敎訓一番。只是這種敎訓，在咖啡館裏聽着，連帶着會有一班旁聽的，讓人家訕笑起來，未免面子上難看。爲了這一點，自己只有閃開爲妙，到了家裏去，哥哥要怎樣的駡，就讓他怎樣的駡得了。他如此想着，也不管哥哥是怎樣一副形色，搶着會了乳茶舖的點心錢，低了頭就回家去了。他到了家裏，向書房裏一溜，心裏兀自砰砰亂跳，他心裏想着，决不要讓哥哥如何大生氣，哥哥說着什麽時，自己認錯就是了。他枯坐在桌子邊，兩手托了頭，只管去轉念頭，如何而後可以平哥哥的氣，哥哥會說些什麽，自己怎樣的去認錯？他如此想着。他心中十五個提桶打水，七上八下的幻想，可是甘厚之並不把這件事，當了緊急公文，到了晚上九點多鐘方始回家。積之等着哥哥的申斥呢，也還不曾睡。然而厚之回得上房，逕自和嫂嫂談話去，並不曾留意這件事。積之想着，大槪哥哥以爲彼此都是個五尺堂堂的漢子，不便讓我太難堪，想着是巳經不說了。這倒放下了一分心事，安然入睡。到了次日起來，也依舊照常辦公，心裏深爲僥倖，以爲已經闖過這個難關去了。然而這日下午回來，可發生問題了。女僕來說，太太請二爺到上房裏去談話。積之聽說，料着有故，心裏又砰砰跳了起來。甘太太坐在堂屋裏一張圍椅上，口裏啣了烟捲，心境很是泰然，看到積之進來，却向他微微一笑。積之站着門口道：嫂嫂呌我有事嗎？甘太太用手指了對面一張椅子道：有話坐下來慢慢的說。你忙什麽？（七三）</p>

<h3 id="c279">巴黎的中國留學生分類 <a href="#c279" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e279" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">279</a></h3>
<p>— 朱梅</p>
<p>因爲去參觀巴黎大學的關係，有朋友和我談到中國留學生的生活。丨丨在前的文章裏我已提到過，但不詳細丨丨中國近來是對於留學生的信仰大大減少了，以前聽說是留學生，無異見了西洋人那般恭敬，如果說是外國的博士，那恭敬之外還加上十二萬分的佩服。現在呢，留學生也見慣了，還是那麽回事，所不同者吃了幾年麵包，或者樣兒學着了幾分洋氣，此外飯桶依然是飯桶，比起國内的學生來也不見得就會高明在那裏。至於說到博士，那自然又是掛羊頭賣狗肉了，有些所謂博士與不博士比較起來常常博士趕不上不博士的，因之大家對留學生更不信仰了。但是，我們先要明白，留學生也不是什麽神聖的東西。本來留學生在他國的人就不如在中國那般，他們眞的非常的尊敬，尊敬的緣因是他們的國家不輕易的讓一個學生到旁的國家去，卽去了就非得學一點什麽東西回來不可，（他們的思想也有多大的差異）再加以各國的經濟情形文化情形不同，自然與中國大有區别了。至於說到中國，根本的一句話，國家也没有想到留學生去外國學什麽回來帮忙中國（你看外交機關之不留心留學生的生活等就可以知道）而所謂留學生也是不全爲想藉留學而求得什麽，這我們可以從下而留學生分類看得出來：</p>
<p>（一）爲學問而留學　所謂學問是包括所有的東西，如工業，文化等。此類學生大致是佔最少數。關於他們的經濟，有的是完全窮苦。有的或是很少的貸費。</p>
<p>（二）爲下野而留學　所謂下野該指大人物，但有部份小官兒，政治上一落了伍，他們很聰敏地，括了一點錢就藉留學到外國留學來了。</p>
<p>（三）爲游玩而留學　這種人物很多，比如上面所指爲下野而留學的也是其中之一部份。中國不乏官僚子弟或士紳子弟，他們覺得中國不好玩於是也藉留學之名來了。</p>
<p>（四）爲名而留學　這種人物大致他自己就是崇拜留學生的，他以爲自己有了錢也該出洋走走，掛個留學生的招牌回來。</p>
<p>（五）爲莫名其妙而留學的　這類人大致是中學還未畢業，别人說留學就跟着留學去了。</p>
<p>（六）政府派的留學生　這類留學生大半都是當過老爺來的，他們已不是完全的學生思想和生活，不過他們來外國過過留學生生活罷了。</p>
<p>至於其他緣因還多。但我們簡單地考查這樣複雜的留學生當中，讀書者究竟佔了幾分之幾？而那些不是讀書而來留學生的留學生回去做些胡塗事你焉得不怪留學生糟？但你知道留學生是如此的多，丨丨有了錢誰能禁止誰留學呢？丨丨同是你也就可以明白一切了。所以在中國駡留學生的人要去明白這緣因，同時也請你們不要崇拜，不管博士也罷，不博士也罷，中國的學生也罷，外國的留學生也罷，要是没有本事一樣地看待就好哪！</p>

<h3 id="c280">萬應靈方 <a href="#c280" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e280" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">280</a></h3>
<p>— 天方</p>
<p>生了病，必需要吃藥，這大槪是古今中外不易之理。雖然像傷風之類，不一定要吃藥，也會自愈，但如遇症情大一點，或是不願久纏床席的，總以吃藥爲宜，這即是不很聰明的人，也能懂得。</p>
<p>祗是一講到吃藥，困難可就發生了。世界上病症，究有多少，這須要去問醫學博士，恕我不是學醫的，不及細知。但自唐以來，就有「千金方」五千三百餘首，倘以每方專治一症　話，則單就「國病」而論，已至少在半萬種以上，其他由外洋輸入的如「黄熱」「黑死」之類，尙不在内。問題的發生就在這裏，病症是這麽多，我想即使如博士之類，也未必能記憶得完全清楚，這樣對症配方，就有點麻煩。而扁鵲華陀之輩，於今又少見，庸醫殺人的新聞，倒常在報紙上看到。眞是使患病的人，頗費躊躇的。何况二十世紀的人類，是過慣高速度生活的，又誰耐煩細細地檢騐，慢慢地醫治呢！所以簡便的治療法，丨丨萬應靈方的發明，是刻不容緩的。倘能將傷寒以至毒門等等用藥，依照「君臣佐使」，加以蒸溜壓榨，融合一劑，如迴文詩之類，横看側覧，俱成妙用。病情雖有萬千，方劑只此一種，豈不是病者醫生與藥房，一舉而兩得之利。丨丨或許那時生産者，丨丨藥房，與消費者，丨丨病人之間，已能直接交易，醫生也可毋須，這又是古之名醫，如華陀等所意想不到的。</p>
<p>二十世紀據說是亞洲的時代，所以這發明的榮譽，便落在亞洲的中國的江蘇省上海漕河涇第二模範監獄。那裏因爲是「模範」的緣故，所以收容的囚徙特别多，足足容納了一千七百餘人。近因不敷應用，正議另建新獄哩。</p>
<p>囚徒們雖失去了身體上的自由，但生病的自由，却並未予以一併剥奪，丨丨反之在鐵窗之中，是更適宜於生病，多數雄糾糾的年青人，爲了要奮擊他們的鐵拳而遭逮捕的，待有機緣出得鐵柵門來，都是形容憔悴，雖然他們不少的是熟血，但都像患了貧血症，此中光陰，眞容易使人老去。據住過來的朋友說，住在像蒼蠅籠式的屋子裏，擠擠的，氣都喘不過來，還不及那動物園中獨佔一欄的熊虎的福。丨丨這話許是有點有激而爲，事實上也不盡然。動物園中的白熊與班毛虎，終日彷徨鐵柵欄中，似也無終老此鄕之意，不過從住在蒼蠅籠中的人看來，是比較舒適一點罷了。</p>
<p>牢獄中人一多，病也相等的增加。爲了病人太多的緣故，於是在科學的管理法下發明了這「萬應靈方」。據報載，新方的名字曰：「公共藥方」。方名「公共」，底下的註脚想是「人人可服」，說來似乎有點新奇，實在並不新奇，譬如有錢的老爺太太們應服參茸燕窩，年青好玩的男女應用「六○六」「她的友」一樣，囚徒是屬於另一組的人丨丨雖犯罪的原因，不見得相同，但在「囚徒」這一個「共名」下，自當吃同一種的藥。方劑的成分，雖不可知，但獄醫官的苦心研究是可佩的。眞不失爲醫藥界的新發見，科學管理的大成功。從此執簡御繁，自可一勞永逸，這在醫官的報酬也不在小。</p>
<p>祇是我要說的不止此，在這合理化運動風靡了世界的時候，政治上的「萬應方」，似乎運用得更早更普遍。黑衣黨首領墨索里尼的靈魂，不是已由意大利而德國，而日本，而飛向别國來嗎！二十世紀的人類是聰明的，而中國人的不落人後，更値得歡喜！</p>
<h3 id="c281">京劇的没落 <a href="#c281" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e281" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">281</a></h3>
<p>— 賢</p>
<p>說起京劇，我眼前就浮起芥川龍之芥的「上海遊記」，他是那樣俏皮的說話。並不爲了他是我們的敵人，那時候我已厭惡這位作家。但是自己老没有踏進過這類戲院的門首，京劇對於我是門外漢，我懷疑着一元的代價（普通的）是否値得，我以對於芥川龍之芥的俏皮話，在我理想中是極端懷恨的</p>
<p>前天我的舅父從鄕間出來，他拖我陪他去觀京劇，我纔獲得了我的代價。當然，我没有化那麽一個大，不過那作家的話是證實了，雖然他說話太刻薄一點。</p>
<p>京劇没落了，宏碧緣，狸貓換太子的全盛時代過去了。大批的小資産階級醉沉在好萊塢的麻醉劑中，除了從外國帶了博士頭銜的梅蘭芳蒞滬的時候，太太小姐們才化了錢去瞧一瞧蕭老頭說有長生術的男扮女裝。</p>
<p>我本來懷疑外國紳士以爲有藝術意味的京劇，在本國是這樣的不景氣。外國紳士的賞覽力，或者竟如此不到嗎？他們自己的藝術丨電影丨也日趨於自殺之途，肉感，獸片，空戰，以至於神怪，老是這套看厭了的把戲。不求本身的改良，慣以投機手腕迎合低級興趣，其不失敗者幾希！</p>
<p>一切梨園的舊規，像帕米爾高峯一樣不能改革。門口站着「啊！二位！」洩長的聲音，不知梅博外在國外表演的時候，也是否這類招徠方法？我們像從前拜客似的踏惟那扇能夠自關的門，没有到八點鐘，垂着廣告幔的角上，一羣人滿頭大汗的奏着Ｏverture，他們是那樣的賣力，一位老太太掩上耳朶說：「頭痛得來！」我的腦殼祗隱隱作痛，年青人這點還佔到便宜。</p>
<p>前十排的座位上，鋪着今天演戲的節目單，高脚盆子四隻一組的安列着，表示已被公館的太太小姐（？）們包空了。我們同樣値價一百分的一隻洋打了折扣，然而我也自已承認近視眼像老太太的頭痛是自作孽，三層樓上不是也瞧得喝彩嗎？</p>
<p>幕啓。</p>
<p>這是清朝丨我直書清朝，不知溥執政同意否？丨一位欽差的故事，同狸貓換太子一樣可以無窮盡搬演。</p>
<p>劇情：淫僧採花，公子落難。有宋朝打扮的欽差，拿破崙裝束的截眼鏡人，有上海話，蘇州白，還有洋涇浜。内中參揷國難嚴重時間提倡尙武精神的打仗，不是紅面孔和白面孔，是飛機和大</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>砲；至於可以「救國」的「跳舞」，也「應有盡有」。綜合滑稽，愛情，肉感，香艶，戰爭於一爐，一九三三年的偉大傑作！</p>
<p>小孩子拍手說：「好看得來！」喊頭痛的老太太搖搖頭，頭痛抑是不好看，我没有問明白。一位紅嘴唇的姑娘嬌聲的對西裝紳士說：「那狗眞乖，比你還乖！」塗寇丹的紅葱指上他的鼻子。</p>
<p>這是不可抹煞的事實，那條狗確比「人」還乖，有許多人不是來看戲，從他們對於狗的批判中可以知道。</p>
<p>京劇没落了，努力改良吧，眞狗上台，旣有出「人」的成績，那四郎探母中的馬鞭子快些換上坐騎。</p>
<p>我的頭還隱隱作痛，不肯多說，這一個義務廣告，要看狗做戲的，不妨化一隻羊。來來看試試看。</p>

<p>— 文</p>
<p>丨感於特殊的報販而作丨</p>
<p>許多男子都在代爲揚眉吐氣，雀躍三百，而女子本身倒並不怎樣在乎。話說自歐風美雨東漸以還，咱們貴國的人事社會，雖細節末枝，都起了突然的變異，加冠上一頂洋幌子，說起來還要算男女關係的變異，最爲顯著，昔年（指未歐化以前）我們的女同胞，全是過的囚犯似的閨閑生活，生育兒女，主管中饋，是伊們唯一的使命，壓得像蒲墊一樣，誠然有些不對。現在總算交了鴻運，做縣官的有了女子，做委員的也有了女子，推而至于機關衙門，公司賓號裏，全都有女同胞挺着胸膛與男人一樣的宣勞于社會了。這麽一拐，男女間的關係，便極光怪複雜之能事，有贊同這樣的，也有反對這樣的，有由嫉妬而蔑視的，也有由捧喝而歌頌的。于是乎平添了不少的新名詞，比女「花瓶」「皇后」「校花」「摩登小姐」「時代姑娘，」極之而「女英雄」「女流氓」「野鷄」「鹹肉莊」等等，其藴義雖各不同，而其來源則一丨都應歸功於歐風美雨。</p>
<p>事實上，在這時代裏，女人確是威風凛凛不可嚮邇；而其魔力之大，更是夫人能知之，夫人能言了。因此公司商店不能不借助于女招待，集會醵欵不能不借助于名媛閨秀，求職求官更不能不</p>
<h3 id="c283">古董要緊 <a href="#c283" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e283" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">283</a></h3>
<p>— 紫薇</p>
<p>借助于阿妺阿姨，紓難救國更不能不借助于玉容，雖云社會地位，人類權利，伊們並不曾掙得。</p>
<p>因爲這麽一來，男子的地位，却無形低降了，幾多痴心拜倒于旗袍革履之下，窮年罄財的追逐不到一個女人，而女子遂越益名貴，越益威風凛凛了。</p>
<p>因爲這麽一來，幾乎全體女同胞都被烘動了，寖寖形成了今日之雌世界，尤其是大都會如上海，女子的活躍，誠不下于男子，在量的方面，也不少于男子，馬路上，遊藝塲裏，工廠裏，……何處不見伊們擁擠着。</p>
<p>話說轉來，爲招徠男顧客，所以要借助女子的玉客，公司必須請女招待，救國必要請舞星。現在都市裏女子旣然這麽活躍，衆多，爲招徠女顧客計，公司，集會，救國等塲合上，誠然也有選置縹緻的男招待之必要，尤其是在女子最愛踏進去的洋貨公司遊戲塲…，需要趕急選置。</p>
<p>某戲院先見及此，故已首爲之倡。那戲院的門首，雇有兩位特殊的縹緻的報販童子，年紀約摸十三四歲，亮的皮鞋，涳藍色的嗶嘰制服制帽，帽上嵌有三個「××報」的通亮的銅字，不像一般拖鼻涕的賣報童子一樣，但他們却能做出幾種怪動人的撒嬌姿式了惹得少奶小姐們在他們的視線下溜過，不自主的會挐出百文來買你一張平價四枚的×晚報看，這當然，女人那有不愛少童的，「美目盼兮，」就是一角錢一張，又豈在乎哉！總算是男招待萌芽的楷模，値得宣揚，</p>
<p>這誠然是振興戰後的滬上遊藝的辦法，說不定是復興整個上海商業的秘訣，願有志于斯者，羣起而仿效之，</p>
<h3 id="c284">煩劇的解脫 <a href="#c284" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e284" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">284</a></h3>
<p>— 炳</p>
<p>這誠然是一種煩劇，需要設法解脫。</p>
<p>空上許已一個月了的擱樓，忽在兩星期前的一個傍晚，搬來了一對年輕的夫妻，我們住的是前客堂，所謂擱樓就搭擱在後客堂之上，因爲是擱，四向都是實的，所以無處可設窗，所以没有窗，有的只是朝對我們室裏的這方面，用小木方釘成許多斜四方形洞口的間壁，闊有一丈多，高却不及兩尺，擱樓裏所需要的空氣就全靠我們的室裏輸送，正因爲是格子窗似的通洞間壁，所以聲氣非常溝通，就是喉管裏微細的咭咕，以及吞痰的聲音，都能聽得分明，這也就種下了煩劇由來的因子。</p>
<p>從二房東口裏，知道這對年輕夫妻，是剛從鄕下出來的，看看他們的舉止，裝飾，也可信得過是道地的内地帮，男的一早便出去了，要深更夜靜才回來，所以我一向還不曾把他認識清楚，印象很是糢糊，至于那女的我倒可以描摹出一個大槪的輪廓來：一張被太陽炙熟似了的面孔，搽上厚厚的一層雪花膏，便活像一張有了折皺的白臘光紙，發育不平稱的身材，裏在細小的似乎摩登的起花青梯的旗　裏，身上便現出不少的凸峯，（恕我不誇她一聲有曲線美）胸前的兩　滿漲的乳房，却像兩隻壯脚魚，再加配脚上的一雙淡綠色紗襪，可以肯定她已是位醉心摩登的準城市婦人了，年紀約摸二十歲左右。</p>
<p>然而她畢竟是喫過苦頭的來路貨，她没有大的奢望，雖然蹲在簡直不能豎腰的擱樓裏，也還自鳴得意，這，多少要歸功他們夫妻倆的熱情，恩愛。</p>
<p>「吃，吃，吃，」的笑聲攙和在翻雲覆雨的淫蕩聲裏，每晚至少的兩陣，睡在臨下的前客堂裏的我們，便被他們攪擾得無法安息了。</p>
<p>「這樣的夫妻，怕不害生病丨一點没有節制的！」鄔君被攪擾得不堪了，往往這樣替他們躭憂。</p>
<p>「是的，不料世界上竟有這等斵傷生命的人，丨丨丨却說這環境于我們眞有些不利！」我進而警戒我們自己。</p>
<p>「以後我們須得找個辦法，當他們……（請恕以……替代）我們就狂呌起來，看他們還胆敢那麽放縱不！」</p>
<p>「對呀，眞的我們只有出此掃興的策計！」</p>
<p>不料而竟也没有靈騐，眞可惱透了，我們犯呌，他們反倒越發狂暴起來了，彷彿有意在向我們驕傲，示威·于是乎我們轉舵掉向，借題發駡，他們也只裝做不懂。</p>
<p>這樣巳煩煞了我們快兩個星期了。我只有敬而遠之，退避三舍，一個子臨晚走到朋友家裏去借宿。</p>
<p>前天我回來，說是這對熱烘烘的年輕夫妻搬走了，而且說是搬回鄕下去了，搬走的原委有兩說，據鄔君探來的消息是這樣；</p>
<p>「因爲那男的害起病來了，生活做不來，所以搬回鄕下去了」</p>
<p>據二房東說；</p>
<p>「因爲那男的發現了女的有些不規矩，與後樓裏的李大有苟且曖昩的勾當，所以送她下鄕去了。」</p>
<p>「管他搬走的原委怎樣，總算是解脫了我們的煩劇！」我慶幸透了着說。</p>

<p>編輯先生：</p>
<p>我是一個初中將要畢業的女學生，</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>在形式上似乎很幸運，時常有父母的保護，師長的指導；但是禍從天上起，現在有一個極嚴重的問題發生，可以使我不能再過這樣舒服的生活，且弄得不好，說不定我的家庭會有解散的一天。</p>
<p>事情是這樣的：我的父親，在十五年前，就有了一個外妾。（是一個妓女）當時，我母親極力反對；但是因爲反對，所以受了很多的虐待，備嘗着種種的壓迫和苦楚。到了現在，她（那個妓女）仍在外面做着我父親的小妾，而我母親呢！祗裝着不曉得，不問也不聞，那到也相安無事。那知在前月，父親又重提舊事，發起進門之說，我母親當然不肯答應，哭着吵着，這樣經過了有一月之久。後來經了許多長輩的解說，和朋友的勸慰，就答應了下來。不過進了門，仍舊住在外面。</p>
<p>今天我放學回家，看見母親又在那裏痛哭；我就吃了一驚，知道一定有事故發生。原因很簡單，今天下午，父親拿回家許多製就的小囡衣服，據說，是她（那個妓女）送給我和妹妹和小弟弟的；當時母親以爲何必要她討好，兩人就發生了口角。我父親在臨走的時候，說將要在端午節以後，不管家中一切的費用。</p>
<p>這句話，父親是常常用來恫嚇母親的；但是這次父親是好像用嚴重的口吻說的，恐怕是有實行的一天。假使實行了，那又怎麽樣呢？</p>
<p>假使我輟學而去謀生活，一個人或者不生問題；但是家中年老的祖母，命途多舛的母親，年幼無知的妹妹，和未滿週歲的小弟弟，還有一個奶媽和一個小了頭，一家七口，怎樣支持得住呢！並且一個孤另另年方十七歲的弱女子，要向社會的險途上去謀生活，這是多麽難　一件事呀？前途茫茫，謀那一種職業好呢！千思萬想，没有一個良好的辦法。</p>
<p>編輯先生：你是人們的指導者，黑暗途上的明燈，眼見得你已解答了多少人的難題，我這一個問題，也請你切實的指導　。祝你</p>
<p>身體康健！朱絮　上</p>
<p>××××</p>
<p>者按：朱女士的來信，言外之意，似乎要想肩起維持一家七口的責任：其志可嘉，其事不可行也。你是一個十七歲的，初中未畢業的女子，不怕你見氣說一句，學識經騐，都還幼稚，一個人自顧自，怕還爲難，那裏肩得了這一家重擔呢？所以這件事，應别尋出路。你還得繼續求學，等到學識經騐，到了相當程度再說。</p>
<p>一個人處世的藝術，貴乎要有一貫的精神，剛則剛到底，柔也要柔得澈底。剛柔相濟，雖則說得好聽，但是弄得不好，往往會陷於左右爲難之境。你母親對於尊大人納妾的一回事，就吃虧在這上頭。說剛罷，那没旣經反對在前，儘可根據法律一夫一妻的規定，反對到底，爲什麽要答允她進門。法律規定，得妻之同意者，不以重婚罪論。說柔罷，那末旣經允許她進門之後，在她送衣服的時候，何論是鬼討好，或是眞心要好，均不該破口搶白。</p>
<p>現在呢，事情尙可挽回，他對於老母妻兒，因爲法律的關係，决不能眞的遺棄；祇須給他一個下塲勢，怕他眞的好意思不管家用嗎。不過家庭之間，不時吵鬧，終非好事，所以希望朱女士轉勸令堂想想，現在事已成事，祇得採柔以克剛的手叚了。</p>

<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>夜已深了，章大爺又睡在她的身旁。這一晚，章大爺非常興舊，他除了告訴他新近又運動了上司一萬五千塊錢，馬上便可發放上任以外，還說要討她回去，將來生兒育女，日後大老婆死了，少不了可以扶正的。像這樣的話，她就從他嘴裏聽過好幾十次了，說了又說，不免怪麻煩的，但是今天聽來却也有道理；他想給一個男人蹂躪到死總比同時侍奉許多男人要求得容易吧。至於日後是否扶正，到也不必介意。於是：</p>
<p>「好，就嫁給他罷。」</p>
<p>這一個妖精，不過爲了自己没有生兒子的希望，却也得容允下去：現在老鬼旣經死了，一個寡婊子當然生不出一滴血來，何况章大爺臨終時也說過這樣的話，於是柳姑娘便不能算是章家的姨太太了。</p>
<p>她手裏的銀行存摺，在老爺死後的第三天便給管家收回去了。除了金銀首飾准她留着以作紀念外，還給了她一千二百塊錢，算是瞻養費，在未找着人家之前，這一幢房子還給她繼續住下去：這樣看來，大太太的爲人到也是滿大方的。</p>
<p>可是在柳姑却也不在乎這些，　銀錢財物一類的東西，她從來就没有很好的打算過。不過自己總是要生活下去的，這一點似乎是不成問題，那末究竟應當怎樣生活下去呢？這在她却還有很好的打算。於是這一問題在她的腦筋裏縈迴了好幾天，可是在她所能意識到的只有這麽幾點，那是：丨</p>

<p>— 東林</p>
<p>四年前一天早晨的所見</p>
<p>我在從前發表的「日本的電影屑談」内，曾經說過，這蒲田攝影塲就是松竹映畫株式會社專門攝取現代片的場所。在日本牠是歷史最長，並且成績最佳的現代片攝影塲。</p>
<p>這是四年前的一個夏天的上午吧，當時我還住在東京郊外的　大森，得到蒲田攝影塲開放的消息，連忙搭了高架電車到蒲田去。從大森到蒲田只有一站路程，所以不到五分鐘，已經達到了目的地。走出蒲田車决，朝北走去，再轉了一個灣，遠遠地就看見，圍着紅白布的攝影塲了。</p>
<p>買了一張門票，我就向着一間大房子的内跑進去，只見有許多長桌，上面陳列着無數的建築物和車輛的模型。我問站在旁邊的招待員，這是做甚麽用的？他對我說，這就是銀幕中所映出來的各種房屋和大厦，火災的一幕，就是燒這種模型的。我聽了他的話，半信半疑地離開了。</p>
<p>走出了這大房子的後門，正要往前走的時候，不料頭上的帽子吹得一丈多遠。我不能不驚疑了：；怎麽好好地天氣，有這麽大的風呢？我拾了帽了，好奇心引我走過去看，究竟什麽東西在那裏作怪。轉灣一看，我明白了；原來這風就是從一架高而大的，形似風扇般的怪東西外發出來的。旁邊站着的工程師，正在那裏對觀衆解說着，這機器就是製造狂風用的。</p>
<p>離開了羣衆，我又轉了一個灣，看見一間小小的車站；站内有一張木板製成的火車的正面，裝着停車的樣子。我想這就是所謂電影中的火車吧！走不到幾步，前面有一個小池，四面的花草，培植得和花園一樣。只有幾步的距離，就有一間車站和花園，這種景象除了攝影塲以外是不能夠看到的。</p>
<p>前面有許多人圍着，我亦走上去，擠進了人羣，看個明白。原來是在攝取下雨的光景。說起這雨眞是可笑極了，這不過是站在高處的人，所撥下來的水吧了！一個演員，亦没有撑着傘，被這水撥得像「河水鬼」一樣的戰慓着·我不覺想起做電影演員的困苦。</p>
<p>這樣東張西望時間不覺已是中午了，我肚子很餓，就出去吃午飯去了。</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3 id="c290">評「桃花村」ＨappyＥevnＡlter <a href="#c290" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e290" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">290</a></h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>在「ＴellＭeＴoＮight」（春江花月夜）之後又有了這一部同一情調的「Ｈ「appyＥverＡfler」，當然，這不是偶然的，我們在這中間多少可以找得出製片家的用意。前一部的内容如何，反正聰明的觀家都會知道，似乎用不着在這裏解剖，那末「桃花村」中又告訴了我們一些什麽呢？它譏笑了好萊塢的製片商，揭穿了少女們對於黄金電影的幻想。然而這都不是本片的製作者主要的任務，它最重大的目的在於敎觀衆們在美麗的畫面之前逃避現實，爲了愛情的美滿而退避到世外桃源中去。很顯然的，在現實社會中，樂享田園的生活早已給現實的經濟組織毁滅無遺，而我們也不再是太平盛世的順民，我們日以繼夜的掙扎着，我們還有「回到桃花村去度那安閒生活」的可能嗎？然而本片作者的用意也就在這裏，他敎我們在幻想中繼續幻想下去。</p>
<p>正如上面所述，爲了要使觀衆沉醉於美麗的幻境，必須要有美麗的畫面，於是導演者便得使用純熟的技巧，載歌載舞的使本片充滿了浪漫的情調，再加上精緻的攝影，增加着那種醉人的色素，於是他的使命乃得成功。</p>
<p>然而導演對於少數的場面仍然是不大活潑的，最顯著的是一個麗琳哈蕙在中間，每邊一個男性並排的而且重覆，好幾個鏡頭，這在畫面上未免是過於機械。其次導演在情調上也還不夠柔和，假如以「柔和」成爲本片之精髓的話。</p>
<h3 id="c291">小范朋克 <a href="#c291" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e291" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">291</a></h3>
<p>— 福倫</p>
<p>將有中華之遊</p>
<p>小范朋克自與其妻瓊克勞馥離異之後，忽又被人控告誘惑罪。范正從　於法律解决。（俟此案了結，即將束裝西遊，屆時當與其父范朋克相會於滬，然後同赴各地遊獵。自計大槪須俟秋凉之後，以訟案尙須延梗時日也。再則小范朋友自與瓊克勞馥宣告分居之後，仍時相過往。據范自言情感反較以前密切，已相偕同出四次，實較與任何女性同遊爲樂云。至於離婚一節，彼與瓊俱不願立卽提出討論，因雙力均無意於娶嫁。而小范朋克則立誓必俟功成業就之時，始再言娶云。</p>
<p>同時劇中没有顯明的高潮，一點也没有力的刺激，雖然劇中也許並不需要這些，可是因此便不能給觀衆何等印象，就導演來說，乃　找不出何等特色的。</p>
<p>演員方面，誰也没有驚人的成績，都是懶懶的平平過去。女主角麗琳哈蕙ＬilianＨarey在夢中的場面和當着美國製片家面前表演跳舞的塲面，都使我們回想起她過去成績，其他方面也總算得存了那種活潑的態度。賈克霍爾伯ＪackＨulbert和遜尼海爾ＳonnieＨale在本片中都不見何等精采，但亦很少胡閙的場合。</p>
<p>收音是好的，佈景亦佳。然而最好的還是攝影方面。然而無論如何，即就技巧說，確是一部堪當上遭的片子。</p>
<h3 id="c292">（觀衆意見「脂粉市場」的觀感） <a href="#c292" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e292" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">292</a></h3>
<p>— 史澤永</p>
<p>明星公司繼「自由之花」以後，四達通有聲影片的「脂粉市場」，十四日起，在新光大戲院公映了！乍看這四個字的名命，我們覺得這萬惡的社會，帶了很濃厚脂粉色彩的上海，便可以知道女子在社會上的地位，不過如這般而已！</p>
<p>二十世紀的上海，一般女子的職業，根本就没有穩固的地位；伊們雖然天天在高喊着婦女解放，自由，提高，可是，那一個有澈底了解的？雖意志堅决如李翠芬，也不免被資本家所侮辱和玩弄。何况有些女子，還自甘墮落的呢？</p>
<p>在這裏，在下並不是有意得罪現代的女性；的確，伊們的意志，是太薄弱了！並且一些也不了解現代社會的虛僞。伊們只憑了一時的意氣，似「飛蛾撲火，」只向着有光的地方亂衝，忘見了前途之危險，要從黑暗的社會中，去尋求光明的出路，要耐勞吃苦，才有好的結果。否則没有這們容易的事哩！</p>
<h3 id="c293">觀「脂粉市塲」後幾點感想 <a href="#c293" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e293" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">293</a></h3>
<p>— 梅邨</p>
<p>「脂粉市塲」確是一張意識較好的影片，牠暴露了社會上的惡勢力和男女間的黑暗，使我觀後覺得滿意下面就是我觀後的幾點感想：</p>
<p>一，百貨公司的四周，旣没有電車和汽車，連黄包車也只一二輛，來往行人也寥若晨星，我以爲旣稱百貨公司，應設在像永安先施那麽樣熱鬧的塲合，纔可以適合大公司的繁華·</p>
<p>二，公司内部的塲面，也應裝得熱鬧一點，像電梯内只有進的而没有出的，並且只有四五個，似嫌清淡·</p>
<p>三，顧客在脂粉部買東西，與女店員胡調，女店員却和他們做眉眼，也嫌失當，這一點我想觀衆都以爲不滿的，在我旁坐的幾位朋友，都在說「簡直没有這樣事實」。</p>
<p>四，飾李翠芬的胡蝶面部表情甚佳，尤其在默思的當兒，眼瞳一瞬，頓現緊漲，心事盡露。如果當時引用别人的聲調來說明她的意思，那末更覺　有力了。</p>
<p>五，末幾幕指示奮鬥的結果，由揀茶葉以至接電話開小商店，其中幾段生活的介紹很簡明，是導演的聰明處。</p>
<h3 id="c294">「脂粉市塲」我評 <a href="#c294" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e294" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">294</a></h3>
<p>— 許瓊</p>
<p>戀愛的穿揷毫無理由</p>
<p>婦女職業，在目前我們中國，的確是一個嚴重的問題。並不是苛刻的說：一般的公司銀行商店，招請女職員，美其名曰提倡婦女職業，其實呢？不過爲招徠一般，急色兒而已，於是來了許多侮辱女性的雅號：什麽花瓶啦，屛風啦，活招牌啦，本能地告訴我們：婦女職業在中國不過玩玩而已。不騷不媚招徠不了主顧，不會向上司獻殷勤，保不住飯碗。這是婦女職業的金科玉律。「脂粉市塲」抓住了這個現實的婦女問題來加一暴露，雖然是很適當的；但我們認爲暴露得不夠，更没有理由的安放了一個歪曲的戀愛故事，動搖了全劇的本身，糢糊了觀衆的心靈！</p>
<p>在結尾，太冲滿了Ｒomantio，因爲從做工所鬥爭出來，並不會這樣的迅速而成功了老閬娘，所謂認識社會的缺點，也根本没有認識。</p>
<p>至於表情：太矯揉造作，女職員哼哼唱歌是有的，在櫃檯裏跳舞太過份些；經理少爺的抹眼睛看女職員太過於做作；胡蝶幾個哭的塲面很好；王獻齋是成功的。</p>

<p>爲愛情而犧牲名譽和幸福</p>
<p>恩納斯篤又重新攀談起來了，但是斗的又來一個波折。一輛破舊小車在人叢中轉轉灣灣的行駛猛力撞在親王車子的後身。安琪拉緊張地向着後窗外面張望，她的父親和車夫踅去調查車子撞損到怎麽樣子。</p>
<p>從這輛破舊小車裏走出來的人穿着一身軍裝！一個軍人，安琪拉想着這人生得漂亮。這人瞥見她好奇似的觀望，便跑到車旁。</p>
<p>「早安，」他面帶風流的笑容開口說。但是恩納斯篤一見這個神情便馬上把窗帷拉下。「無恥！」他發着貴族的脾氣咕嚕着。這車子便開動了。</p>
<p>「那是誰？」這少年軍人跑回到他的車子時問那些嘲笑着同伴。</p>
<p>「那，居望尼，是謝樂孟德老親王，」一個人說。「那美麗的公主就是他的女兒。」</p>
<p>居望尼如獲珍寳似的拍拍他的破舊車子的發動機。他的心早已飄飄蕩蕩地跟着那華麗的車子所載去的媚笑的倩影去了。</p>
<p>在謝樂孟德王宮裏，恩納斯篤拘守着細節親吻安琪拉的手，便笑着說要趕火車到羅馬去了。安琪拉踅到對向市鎭的窗前，幽恩默想地傾斜出身子向外看。</p>
<p>「他們眞開心呀，密娜，」她說。「聽那音樂！」她輕微提起她的裙子試一回舞步。</p>
<p>「密娜，我又夢想他了，」他紅暈着說。</p>
<p>「他是誰呢？」密娜做着針綫反問。</p>
<p>「那人我夢想的。這次他的名字是渥郎社。他騎着有黑斑的白馬。母親也同在那裏。她是很美麗！金黄色的頭髮。母親有没有金黄色的頭髮呢？爲怎麽没有母親的照片呢？」</p>
<p>這不是一個新問題，但是密娜回答：</p>
<p>「我告訴過您了丨因爲您的父親不願意它呀。」安琪拉回到陽台，側身靠上欄桿凝神眺望。</p>
<p>「密娜，」她突然說，「我們出去！我們吃飯是不是還有兩點鏡？去看看嘉年會！」安琪拉說着兜進房間。抓住她的披肩。「我一個人去，」他反抗着說了就飛奔而去。密娜說聲「您不能呀！」便一把抓起他的外套趕着追去。</p>
<p>貼近着嘉年會看眞熱鬧！她的芳心卜卜地跳。農人與兵混合着，跳舞，玩，前列遊行隊裏有稗官野史的人物，有巨人，有兩三個人裝成的怪獸。一匹馬伸着鼻子對着快樂到極點的安琪拉嗅，一忽兒又跌倒在地，反翻打滾。在這當兒，前次破舊小車裏的軍人在人叢中出現，站在他們面前，微傴着身。</p>
<p>「公主午安，」居望尼說。這次可没有嚴厲的手在他和那嫵媚的漲紅的面龐之間拉下帷幕了。</p>

<p>(Tientsin) Huang Fu's Special Train Arrived in Tientsin at 9:40 AM on the 17th. He Disembarked at the New Station. Tzu Hsüeh-chung and Leaders of Provincial and Municipal Organizations All Came to the Station to Welcome Him. The Station Interior and Exterior, and the Tachin Road Were Under Extremely Tight Security. Police and Military Police Were Fully Armed on Duty. Huang Went to the Provincial Government to Rest. A Luncheon Was Held to Welcome Him. In Addition to Various Provincial Committee Members, Wang I-tang and Chien Tsung-tse Were Among Those Present. They Discussed the Current Situation for a Long Time. He Left Tientsin at 1:40 PM in the Afternoon to Go to Peiping. Huang Answered Reporters' Questions as Follows: (1) I Am Coming North This Time Under the Central Government's Intentions, and Will Naturally Follow the Central Government's Intentions. I Believe That if All Parties Can Be Organized, Step by Step, in Harmony and Cooperation, Public Morale Can Be Stabilized. Party, Government, and Military Authorities, as Well as the General Public, Should Also Share the Heavy Burden of the Current Situation, National Crisis, and Work Together. Otherwise, Everyone Will Go Their Own Way and Go Against Each Other, and There Will Be No Certainty About Anything. (2) Resisting While Negotiating, President Wang Has Repeatedly Said This. The Entire Issue Still Awaits the Leadership of the Central Government. But After Arriving in Peiping, if Necessary, I Will Briefly Confer With All Parties. (3) The Rumor of Compromise is Just That. The Central Government Has Not Said This. The Situation in North China is So Dire. How Can There Be Compromise? Who Dares to Talk About Compromise? (4) The Military Organs in Peiping and Tientsin Moving to Other Places and Turning Peiping and Tientsin Into a Buffer Zone is Entirely Unheard Of. This Must Be Villainous Rumors. (5) The Affairs of North China Are Very Complicated. After Arriving in Peiping, I Will Confer At Length With the Various Committee Members. Moreover, This Type of Organization is Newly Established. How To Proceed Still Needs Joint Research. As For the Matters That Should Be Handled, Even if the Organs Are Not Established, They Must Be Handled First. Committee Member Ho Will Be Responsible For Military Affairs, and I Can Also Assist in the Process. When Huang's Special Train Had Just Entered the Platform, Outside the East Yang Banner, Someone Suddenly Threw a Bomb. Six Soldiers and Police Guarding the Bridge Were Simultaneously Stunned. The No. 21 Bridge Foundation Was Destroyed. The Bridge Was Slightly Damaged. The Criminal Suffered Minor Injuries to His Hands, Feet, and Face, Was Arrested on the Spot, Sent to the First Army Headquarters, and Confessed to Being Liu Kuei-sheng, 16 Years Old, From Tsaochou, Shantung, Working at Liu San-fen's Fertilizer Factory in Chenchiakou. He Firmly Denied Throwing the Bomb. He Was Tied and Beheaded Outside the New Station This Afternoon as a Warning. Also, Half an Hour Before Huang Left Tientsin, a Bomb Was Discovered on Tachin Road, Huangwei Road, and the Tsancha on Tan Chia Bridge. Considering Its Intention, it Seemed to Plot to Bomb Huang's Car. Fortunately, It Was Discovered Early and No Incident Occurred. Two Suspects Were Arrested on the Spot. According to General Speculation, the Atmosphere of Compromise With Japan Has Been Strong in Recent Days, Inciting the Anger of Patriotic Elements, Using the Bomb as a Warning to Huang. This Theory Seems Quite Plausible. (17th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Peiping) Huang Fu, Along With Ho Chi-kung, Tao Lü-chien, and More Than Ten Others, Arrived in Peiping at 4:40 PM This Afternoon. Liu Chung-chieh, Chiang Po-cheng, Chang Chün, Wang Shu-chang, Chou Ta-wen, and Others All Came to the Station to Welcome Him. The Military Affairs Committee Dispatched a Company of Guards and a Platoon of Central Military Police, Stationing Them Around the Station. After Leaving the Station, Huang Went to Chüjen Hall to Visit Ho Ying-chin. They Spoke for Over an Hour. He Returned to Fengtse Garden in Nanhai to Rest. Huang Said That the Political Affairs Committee Has Not Yet Determined the Date of Establishment Because the Committee Members Have Not Yet Arrived. However, Committee Affairs Can Be Contacted and Handled With the Various Committee Members at Any Time. To Cope With the Crisis in North China, We Must Adhere to the Central Government's Consistent Policy of Negotiating While Resisting. All Parties Must Work Together to Succeed. The Rumor of Sino-Japanese Compromise is Absolutely Inaccurate. I Will First Inspect the Situation and Then Determine the Method for Reorganizing North China's Political Affairs. Ho Will Be Responsible For Military Affairs. The Central Government Still Intends to Take Charge of Everything in North China. As For Stabilizing the Public Morale in North China, There is No Certainty. The Rumor That Peiping and Tientsin Military Organs Will Be Relocated to Serve as a Sino-Japanese Buffer Zone is Not the Central Government's Intention. It Seems to Be a Groundless Rumor.

<p>(Peiping) The Newly Appointed Chairman of the Peiping Political Reorganization Committee, Huang Fu, Arrived in Peiping at 4:35 PM Today. Ho Ying-chin and Other Government Personnel Went to Welcome Him. Huang Told Chinese Reporters That He Denied That He Had Come North This Time to Conduct Reconciliation Talks With Japan, and Said That He Would Abide by the Central Government's Policy to Deal With the Situation in North China. His First Task Was to Stabilize the Public Morale in North China. According to Local Evening Newspapers, This Morning, When Huang's Special Train Entered Tientsin Station, a Young Man Threw a Bomb on the Railway Overpass, Resulting in Injuries to Two Soldiers. The Railway Overpass Was Also Damaged, But the Special Train Was Unharmed. The Bomber Was Apprehended on the Spot, But Did Not Confess. Therefore, When Huang Arrived in Peiping, the Station Was Temporarily Under Martial Law to Prevent Accidents. (17th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Tientsin) According to a Certain Source, The Plainclothes Team of the Japanese Concession Had Received Firearms and Issued Passwords on the Evening of the 17th. There Were Extraordinary Preparations in the Japanese Military Barracks. The Atmosphere Was Extremely Tense. Shops in the Vicinity of the Government Building and City Hall Were Closed at 9 PM, and Pedestrians Disappeared From the Roads. At 8:40 PM, a Sudden Loud Noise Reverberated, Shaking the Entire City. Enquiries Around Various Places Yielded No Reports. It Was Undoubtedly Issued From the Japanese Concession. (17th Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Peiping) Changpei Dispatch, The Japanese Side Ordered Liu Kuei-tang's Unit to Attack Changpei From Dolon, Intending to Seize Kalgan. Liu Kuei-tang is Preparing to Mobilize, and Forced Chang Hai-peng's Unit to Attack Kuyüan, Chihkeng, and Lungkuan From P'ingning. Liu and Chang's Two Units Jointly Attacked Kalgan. Chang's Unit First Dispatched Two Branches, Namely the Chuan Yü-fen and Ying Fei Cavalry Units, a Total of 4,000 Troops, on the 12th From Fengning, Scheduled to Arrive at Tatan on the 17th.

<p>Japanese Intentions Towards North China</p>
<h3 id="e21">There is Talk of Joint International Administration of North China <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>(Peiping) Although it is Difficult to Predict Whether the Japanese Army's Intentions in Pressuring Near Peking With Heavy Troops Are to Occupy Peiping and Tientsin, It is Inevitable That They Want to Force Our Country to Submit and Obey. However, Our Side is Determined Not to Submit. Currently, There Are Three Theories From the Japanese Side About North China. (1) Pu Yi Entering the Pass to Ascend the Throne. (2) New Organization of Traitors Like Li Chi-chun and Chang Pi. (3) Following the Precedent of the Boxer Protocol and Asking Various Countries to Temporarily Jointly Administer North China, With the Japanese as the Center of Gravity, and Then Appoint Chinese People to Local Government Affairs. It is Difficult to Predict Which of the Three Theories Will Prevail. It is Heard That When Yoshizawa Came to Peiping Last Time, He Tried to Persuade Various Ambassadors With Joint Administration. It is Unknown What the Results Were. (17th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Peiping) There is Talk That Shih Yu-san Has Already Defected to the Puppet State and is Coordinating in Chinhuangtao. Traitors are Everywhere. Since the Incident of Buying Assassins in Yu Hsueh-chung's Affair, Military and Political Officials Are Wary. (17th Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Nanking) Wu Tieh-cheng Said That Recently the Japanese Bandits Have Occupied Shihhsia, and Peiping and Tientsin Have Suddenly Become Critical. Some of My Countrymen Believe That Peiping and Tientsin Cannot Be Protected in the End, or That After the Enemy Occupies Peiping and Tientsin, the Central Government Will Change Its Attitude. In Fact, These Are All Mistakes. The Central Government's Long-Term Resistance Policy Will Never Change. Although the Enemy Has the Upper Hand Now, It Will Not Be Easy for Them to Acquire Peiping and Tientsin. Even if Peiping and Tientsin Are Lost by Any Chance, for the Sake of Our Country's Dignity, We Must Retaliate With a Do-or-Die Battle. Generalissimo Chiang Has Long Planned to Divide His Troops to Go North to Rescue North China and Recover Lost Territories. Therefore, He Has Entrusted the Task of Suppressing Bandits to the Three Route Commanders-in-Chief of the South, Northwest, and West, With the Southern Route Being Particularly Important to the Overall Situation of Suppressing Bandits. However, Recently, I Heard That the Southern Route's Commander-in-Chief and Deputy Commander-in-Chief, Chen Chi-tang and Bai Chongxi, Have Both Indicated That They Will Not Take Office. If This is True, It Will Inevitably Increase the Difficulty of Resisting Japan, Which is Truly Regrettable. In Short, With a Great Enemy Before Us, Who is an Enemy and Who is a Friend is Easiest to Understand. We Should Unite Immediately to Resist Foreign Aggression and Save the Country. Otherwise, When the Nest is Overturned, There Will Be No Intact Eggs. It Will Be Too Late to Regret. I Have No Intention of Going North. (17th Dispatch)</p>

The Ministry of Finance Received a Telegram From Sung From the United States Yesterday, Briefly Stating That the Date of His Return to China After Attending the British Economic Conference Still Needs to Be Awaited. Because the Ministry of Finance's Fundraising is Important, He Requested That the Newly Appointed President of the Central Bank, Kung Hsiang-hsi, Assist With Everything.

<p>(Nanking) Naval Chief Chen Shao-kuan Spoke About: (1) Regarding the Case of Chang Hsueh-liang Stealing and Selling the Tientsin Naval Hospital, Although the Central Government Has Negotiated, Not Only Has the Tientsin French Consulate Ignored It, But It Has Also Demolished Most of the Buildings, Demarcated a Part of the Base, and Sold It at a High Price, Using the Proceeds From the Sale to Build Kuanma Road. This Kind of Sticking Plaster Action is Opposed by My Ministry to the End. As For the Recovery Method, It is Currently Divided Into Two Steps. One is Negotiation, and the Other is Force. The First Method is Currently Being Adopted, With the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Negotiating With Them. As For Whether to Adopt the Second Method, It Depends on the Results of the First Method of Negotiation. (2) The Defense of Shanghai, Wuhan, and Various Ports in the Yangtze River Basin is Solid, and the River Defense is Peaceful. (3) The Situation in Peiping and Tientsin is Critical. My Army is Fighting Bravely and Can Certainly Achieve the Effect of Turning Danger Into Safety. In Any Case, There is Absolutely No Room for Direct Negotiations Between China and Japan.

<p>(Nanking) In Recent Years, Overseas Chinese in Mexico Have Been Subjected to Abuse by the Mexican Side, and Most Have Been Expelled Back to China. The Situation is Serious. A Reporter Visited a Certain Authority to Ask About the Truth. According to the Interview, in Recent Years, Both Shunshan Provinces in Mexico Have Expelled Overseas Chinese. The Embassy in Mexico Has Negotiated Seriously, But the Mexican Central Government Has No Power to Stop It. Negotiations With Various Provinces Have Been Ineffective. Two Years Ago, They Tried to Have the US Government Act as a Mediator, But It Could Not Be Carried Out Due to Mexican Opposition. Last Year, They Planned to Appeal to the League of Nations, But the Mexican Side Claimed That the Overseas Chinese Were Unwilling to Obey the Regulations and Voluntarily Closed Their Businesses and Went Elsewhere, and Did Not Admit That There Were Arrests and Abuses, So It Was Inconvenient to Bring It Up. Later, They Planned to Start From the Beginning of a Treaty, and Issued a Draft of the Sino-Mexican Treaty, Ordering the Embassy in Mexico to Discuss It With the Mexican Government, But There is Still No Progress. A Month Ago, the Anti-Chinese Headquarters in Mexico City Issued a Declaration, Advising the Anti-Chinese Parties in Good Provinces to Adopt More Moderate Measures, But With No Results. Recently, Some Suggested to the Central Government That the Path of Negotiation Has Been Exhausted, and Requested That Decisive Measures Be Taken. However, Regarding Mexico's Interests in China, Our Actions Seem to Need to Be Considered Carefully. In Short, the Central Government Has Always Been Concerned About the Overseas Chinese in Mexico. However, the Policies and Methods to Deal With It Must Be Carefully Considered to Achieve Practical Results. (17th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e30">Peace in Tianjin, North China and the Overall Situation <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>— From Germany</p>
<p>In recent days, the enemy's situation has become increasingly urgent. Shixia has fallen, they have crossed the Luan River, Tangshan has been abandoned, and Miyun has been bombed. Tianjin and Beijing are already in a precarious position of being overlooked from a height. Furthermore, internal spies are lurking, willingly acting as accomplices to the enemy, and the people's hearts are restless, making it impossible to feel secure even for a single day. I have yet to see any comprehensive defense plan from the government, and the few troops on the front lines who are fighting hard for a long time have already reached the end of their strength. In fact, they are definitely powerless to defend this dangerous city under the enemy's gaze. The enemy has declared, "We must obtain Tianjin and Beijing." We look north with longing, truly overwhelmed with worry and fear, and even more so with grief and indignation.</p>
<p>If Tianjin and Beijing are lost, then North China will be difficult to protect. If North China is not protected, then the entire situation of our country will be shaken. This connection is as clear as pointing at one's palm, with no room for doubt. Therefore, the current crisis in Tianjin and Beijing is already a matter of life and death for our entire nation. The severity of the situation is no longer comparable to the fall of Liaoning and Jilin, and the loss of Rehe. If we still regard it with indifference and remain unconcerned, then in the blink of an eye, our country will inevitably follow in the footsteps of Annam and Korea. Once the country is destroyed, the nation will be reduced to slaves. At that time, even if we want to love and save our country, it will be impossible.</p>
<p>However, judging from the current situation, we cannot help but believe that our entire country, from top to bottom, seems to have already resigned itself to becoming slaves of a conquered nation. From beginning to end, the government has not shown any comprehensive defense plan, but only uses a small number of troops to resist the powerful enemy in what seems like a childish game. Day after day, new defensive positions are established; day after day, strategic retreats are made. As a result, the enemy approaches daily, we retreat daily, our territory shrinks daily, and the national crisis deepens daily. This dangerous state is truly unprecedented. Two months ago, the ancient artifacts of Beiping were already being shipped south in batches. Currently, various schools in Tianjin and Beijing are also planning to move south, while the land and the people are disregarded. What is the intention? What is the plan? We truly cannot fathom the depths of their minds. What is even more painful is that the country is in such danger, yet the Sichuan Rebellion has erupted again. The entire country exerts itself to kill each other, and remains indifferent to the great enemy at hand. Alas! Cooking beans to burn the beanstalk, slaughtering each other behind closed doors, those close to us are heartbroken, and our enemies rejoice. With the fishermen watching around us, will we ultimately become the snipe and the clam?</p>
<p>As for our people, they seem to be content with temporary peace and security, and do not care about national affairs at all. Recalling the January 28th Incident of last year, Shanghai was under the ravages of artillery fire, Zhabei was reduced to scorched earth, and the enemy and our forces fought to the death with blood and flesh. The people of Shanghai witnessed it with shock and awe. However, other parts of Shanghai remained indifferent, indulging in pleasure and poison, as if everything were normal. Today, Tianjin and Beijing are in a state of emergency, and people's hearts are in turmoil. However, outside of Tianjin and Beijing, people are still singing and dancing, as if nothing is happening. Even in Shanghai, the decadent music, the fox trot dances, the extravagance and intoxication, are causing people to forget death and indulge in pleasure. "The singing girls do not know the hatred of a fallen nation, and across the river they still sing 'The Flowers of the Rear Courtyard'." Faced with this kind of utterly inappropriate and strange phenomenon, we can only beat our chests and cry in anguish.</p>
<p>In this world, only death and national subjugation cannot be experienced. Because people cannot be brought back to life after death, and a country that has been destroyed is not easy to restore. Moreover, once a person dies, everything is over, and the dead are no longer in pain. As for national subjugation, the entire nation is reduced to beasts of burden and slaves, unable to seek death or survive. The pain and suffering are beyond imagination. The people of our country are indulging in pleasure and poison today, and remain indifferent to the country's peril, as if they have not yet tasted the bitterness of national subjugation. India, Egypt, Korea, and Burma are all vivid examples before our eyes. What kind of suffering and pain did they encounter?</p>
<p>In short, the current crisis in Tianjin and Beijing is not a local problem of Tianjin and Beijing, but a whole problem related to the life and death of our entire country. Saving Tianjin and Beijing is to save North China, and saving North China is to save China. The times are critical and the situation is pressing. We must urgently make a comprehensive plan and a comprehensive strategy. This is the last and only opportunity. Our government and our people must have a final awakening and make a final plan.</p>

<p>Countries Guarantee Their Troops Will Not Cross Borders</p>
<p>The U.S. Wholeheartedly Endorses the Conclusion of a Consultation Convention</p>

<p>(Washington) U.S. President Roosevelt's declaration calling for world peace guarantees, the outline of which was reported yesterday, was sent directly to the heads of state of 54 nations, going beyond the Geneva forum. It serves as a warning to Europe about the dangers of continuing to bargain for national interests within the disarmament conference, and aims to eliminate the signs of failure of the future World Economic Conference. In addition to advising the world to accept British Prime Minister MacDonald's disarmament proposal as the first step to avoid war, it also invites countries to independently guarantee that they will not send armed forces outside their borders, and attaches a powerful warning: If any powerful country refuses to clearly record its willingness to oppose aggressive behavior, then when disaster strikes in the future, the world will know where the blame lies, and hopes that countries will not bear this heavy responsibility.</p>
<h3 id="e35">Consultation Convention <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>The British disarmament plan stipulates a consultation system. This move by the US President shows that the American foreign policy of strictly refusing to be bound by consultation conventions has undergone significant changes.</p>
<h3 id="e36">Peace Guarantee <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>In addition, the US President also proposed that at a time when the disarmament machinery of the whole world is operating tirelessly under the British plan, existing armaments and forces should not be increased any further. Countries should solemnly guarantee that their combat weapons will not be increased. President Roosevelt stated in the document that during the entire period of arms reduction, world peace must be guaranteed. Therefore, I propose a fourth step, which will run concurrently with these three proposals, and will rely entirely on the faithful implementation of these three proposals and be bound by existing treaty rights.</p>
<h3 id="e37">Three Suggestions <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>I propose that all countries of the world conclude a solemn and effective non-aggression pact. I also propose that all countries solemnly reaffirm their obligations to limit and reduce armaments. I further propose that if all signatory countries can faithfully fulfill this obligation, then each country should agree not to send armed forces of any kind beyond its borders.</p>
<h3 id="e38">Clearly Define Responsibility <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>The US President also warned countries, saying that common sense tells us that if any powerful country refuses to join the worldwide joint effort with true sincerity to ensure political and economic peace, then these two major joint efforts, one in Geneva and one in London, will be hindered and will not make progress. Once this happens, the civilized world, which is thirsty for both kinds of peace, will know who is responsible for the failure. I urge all countries not to bear this heavy responsibility, and hope that the countries participating in the two major conferences will translate their declared policies into action.</p>
<p>Finally, the US President pointed out that at a time when everyone urgently needs to shoulder the heavy responsibility of maintaining world peace, small obstacles should be removed, small objectives should be abandoned, and concluded by stating that I believe your government will be able to join in realizing this hope.</p>
<h3 id="e39">Communication with Soviet Russia <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>This document from the US President was sent directly to the heads of state of 54 nations, including Soviet Russia, and was addressed directly to Mikhail Kalinin, Chairman of the Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union. It is worth noting that this is the first time that an American president has directly addressed a document to an unrecognized country. Some commentators believe that it fully demonstrates President Roosevelt's urgent desire to convene the world to jointly plan for the great cause of peace.</p>
<p>This document is currently being recorded and sent to Congress for reference, because if the United States joins any international agreement, it must be approved by the Senate. Before issuing this document yesterday, Roosevelt met with several Senate leaders for a long time, and it is expected that he has already obtained the Senate's assurance that it will approve the United States' joining the proposed pact.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the US President's appeal for peace guarantees is actually intended to achieve the complete victory of the World Economic Conference. Therefore, in the document, when discussing international relations, he stated that countries have convened two major conferences to eliminate the disorder in the economic world. The World Economic Conference will be held soon and must quickly end. The world cannot sit and wait for protracted discussions. The conference must stabilize currency values, allow free flow of world trade, and jointly raise commodity prices internationally in order to establish order and eliminate existing disturbances. We must slightly restrain our individual domestic plans and work together for wise and thoughtful international action to promote economic recovery. The disarmament conference has been going on for more than a year and has not yet achieved satisfactory results. Various confusing proposals are still in dangerous conflict.</p>

<p>Our responsibility today lies in seeking practical and feasible results through joint action, based on the greatest welfare of the greatest number. It must be known that the lives, happiness, and prosperity of men, women, and children all over the world depend on the decisions of the governments in the near future. He then pointed out the impact of disarmament on the economic conference. How can we calmly decide economic issues if there are other entanglements before us? He also said that countries establish armaments for only two reasons: a small number of countries want to acquire the territory of neighboring countries, but the majority are afraid of aggression by others. Modern offensive weapons are far sharper than defensive weapons, and this fear is justified. Therefore, if all countries can fully agree not to use offensive weapons, then national defense will naturally be as solid as a golden soup, and the borders and independence of each country will be secure, and the fear of aggression by others will naturally disappear.

<p>MacDonald Believes It is a Remarkable Appeal</p>
<p>Soviet Russia is Completely Surprised and Especially Pleased</p>
<p>Stubborn Germany Also Expresses Approval</p>
<p>The Italian Government Announces Unconditional Acceptance</p>
<p>Only France Remains Skeptical and Silent</p>
<p>(Washington) Governments of various countries have responded with acceptance of the proposals and praise for the policies in President Roosevelt's appeal for a guarantee of peace. Even Germany, which has been most stubborn on disarmament and prompted the U.S. President to take this extraordinary action, has expressed its approval. German officials generally believe that this document has opened a path to resolving disputes.</p>
<p>In London, British Prime Minister MacDonald, speaking at a meeting of the St. George's Society, told the American women present that he welcomed the U.S. President's declaration, considering it a remarkable appeal, and said that this move by the U.S. President would be a great monument in the history of the peace movement. With this declaration from the U.S., it will no longer disregard matters related to world peace. At the same time, the British Prime Minister also declared that although Britain supports Germany's lifting of current restrictions, its future attitude will depend largely on Germany's actions and less on Germany's self-proclaimed desire for peace.</p>
<p>News from Moscow: Russia received this document completely unexpectedly. Since the revolution, this is the first time that there has been a direct communication between the United States and Russia. Political leaders all said that the U.S. President's appeal was direct and to the point, and welcomed it as a means of achieving international understanding, and regarded this move as an indication of removing obstacles that have prevented the exchange of views between the U.S. and Russia. Officials generally felt gratified and expected that the resumption of diplomatic relations between the U.S. and Russia would be a matter of time.</p>
<p>News from Rome: Italian authorities claimed that Italy unconditionally accepted this proposal, as Italian Prime Minister Mussolini believed that the situation created by the disarmament conference was one of the most dangerous that the world had seen in many years, and believed that if there was no significant progress towards peace at this time, countries would be plunged into extreme turmoil.</p>
<p>Disarmament delegates in Geneva praised the President's courage and魄力. Before German Chancellor Hitler explained Germany's attitude towards rearmament to the Reichstag, he directly appealed to the whole world for a guarantee of peace. It is expected that the U.S. President's proposal will be able to moderate the German Chancellor's speech.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for the Mexican government announced tonight that the Mexican government will instruct its representative in Geneva to follow the peace principles put forward by the U.S. President and support his proposal at the disarmament conference. It also said that the country's economic situation currently appears to have made great progress. If so, it will allow Mexico to remain within the League of Nations. Mexico had intended to withdraw from the League of Nations because the burden of membership fees was too heavy.</p>
<p>France seems to be skeptical of the U.S. President's proposal. Although government officials have remained silent, many politicians in the opposition say that they fear that unconditional acceptance will weaken France's position, and believe that France can only accept this kind of proposal after Germany modifies its armaments requirements. If Germany does not change its armaments requirements, then the responsibility for the failure of the disarmament conference should be borne by Germany. (National Telegraph, 16th)</p>
<p>Rome: President Roosevelt's declaration has had a great effect in Italy. It is generally felt that it is difficult for any country to reject this proposal and bear the responsibility for destroying disarmament. (Reuters telegram, 16th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Disarmament Conference Chairman Henderson welcomed the U.S. President's request, saying that if governments of all countries agree, a disarmament convention should be concluded quickly. (Reuters telegram, 16th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Today, the exchange market price rose slightly, all thanks to the U.S. President's declaration. It is generally felt that this declaration is very timely and can make German Chancellor Hitler deliberate on his speech to be delivered to the Reichstag on Wednesday. (Reuters telegram, 16th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Today, a representative of the Little Entente said that although most of the major powers have responded to the U.S. President's declaration, the two issues of France's security and Germany's equality of armaments still exist. Therefore, it is not surprising here that France is not immediately enthusiastic about the U.S. President's proposal not to send troops out of the country. If President Roosevelt's intention is for the United States to join a truly effective consultation convention, then the disarmament conference may be saved. However, it is expected that France and the Little Entente will still insist on concluding a security convention and continue to oppose Germany's demand for the right to rearm. Also, observers here expect that the United States may not be unable to agree to participate in military action under a consultation convention. Therefore, there is hope here that the position taken by the United States will have the effect of moderating Germany's change of strategy, so that a disarmament agreement that satisfies the French can be signed. If Hitler can moderate his demands and abandon his war-like language, he may be able to remove obstacles and open a path to understanding based on the U.S. President's proposals.

<p>(Washington) After issuing his declaration and request to the 44 nations, President Roosevelt issued an equally important document to Congress, saying that he put forward the proposal for a world non-aggression pact because he gradually saw that the guarantee of world political and economic peace and stability was now threatened by selfish and short-sighted policies and actions. The American people's deep-rooted expectations for a better life situation and their desire to avoid war are shared by the people of all countries. To achieve this goal, it is necessary to reduce armaments and completely abolish the tools that can make war successful. Only then can the invasion of any other country and the destruction of national sovereignty be prevented. All countries now understand this meaning, because there must be this abolition, and only then can small countries be comparatively less harmed by big countries. The lack of government funds and the crisis of bankruptcy are caused primarily by the excessive number of troops, and the only thing that can prevent aggression is disarmament. The American people understand that if other countries have aggressive weapons, then they need aggressive weapons themselves; if other countries are willing to give up aggressive weapons, they are willing to give them up themselves.

<h3 id="e45">Original Text of the Peace Application <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>Transmitted to Our Government Yesterday by the U.S. Embassy</p>
<p>Visionary and Pioneering Historical Initiative</p>
<p>Important Change in American Foreign Policy</p>
<p>(Nanjing) U.S. President Roosevelt sent a joint application to the heads of state of 44 countries around the world (including the Soviet Union) on the 16th, asking all countries to reduce armaments, absolutely abolish aggressive weapons, and agree to stop armed troops from crossing borders, in order to save the failure of the disarmament conference and promote the success of the World Economic Conference. This is truly a visionary and great move, and it is also a very important indication of recent American foreign policy. The request to National Government Chairman Lin was sent to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for submission by U.S. Embassy Counselor Peck at 5 PM on the 17th. The original text is translated as follows:</p>
<p>To Chairman Lin of the National Government of the Republic of China,</p>
<p>As the head of the American government, I, based on the deep hopes of my own people, address you and ask you to convey to the Chinese people what this hope is: to maintain peace through feasible disarmament methods, and to make our joint efforts to overcome the economic chaos victorious. To achieve this goal, all countries have convened two major world conferences. The happiness, prosperity, and even the lives of men, women, and children in this world depend on the decisions that each country's government will take in the near future. The improvement of social conditions, the protection of human rights, and the development of social justice all depend on this decision. The World Economic Conference is about to open and will make a decision immediately, because the world cannot allow this decision-making process to be delayed any longer. The conference must find ways to change the current chaotic situation and stabilize it. The methods are nothing more than stabilizing the monetary system, allowing free movement of world commerce, and using international cooperation to raise commodity prices. In short, the conference should use wise and prudent international actions to assist each country's individual domestic plans to restore the economy. The disarmament conference has been meeting for more than a year, but has not been able to achieve satisfactory results. Differences of opinion with each other still present dangerous conflicts. Therefore, our responsibility is to act together to achieve practical results based on the greatest happiness for the majority of the people. In the face of this extraordinary responsibility, all small obstacles and objectives should be eliminated. Whoever triumphs because of selfishness will ultimately fail. Wherever there is progress towards lasting peace in the world for those of us who live together, it is the only thing worth our efforts. Despite the lessons of the European War and its cruel circumstances, the burden of armaments on the people of all countries in the world today is heavier than at any time before. Let us ask the reason for these armaments. Clearly, there are only two reasons: One is that some governments have clear or hidden objectives to expand their territory at the expense of their neighbors. I dare to believe that governments with such objectives are only a few. The second is fear of aggression by other countries. I dare to believe that most countries feel the need to maintain excessive armaments not because they intend to invade other countries, but because they fear aggression by other countries. This fear is justified, because modern offensive weapons are far stronger than modern defensive weapons. Structures like fortresses, electrical nets, and coastal defenses are suitable for defense, but they are easily destroyed if attacked by aircraft, heavy artillery, tanks, and poison gas cannons. If all countries in the world can agree to stop equipping and using effective offensive weapons, then defensive work will naturally become inviolable, and the borders and independence of each country will naturally be safe. The complete abolition of offensive weapons is the ultimate goal of the disarmament conference. The effective reduction of several or many kinds of offensive weapons is the immediate goal of the disarmament conference. This government dares to believe that the strategies for immediately reducing aggressive weapons that are currently being discussed in Geneva are only the first step in reaching the ultimate goal. We do not believe that the steps proposed to be implemented immediately are sufficient, but this government still welcomes the methods currently proposed and is willing to continue to take further steps in disarmament to achieve success. In short, the following three steps should be agreed upon in the current discussions: (1) To achieve this goal, the first definite measure should be taken immediately, as broadly specified in the MacDonald Plan. (2) Time and procedure should be agreed upon to complete the overall method. (3) During the first step and subsequent methods, no country shall increase its armaments above the limits prescribed by the treaty. However, world peace must be guaranteed during the entire period of disarmament. Therefore, I propose a fourth step. This step is in line with the faithful performance of the above proposals and in accordance with existing treaties, that is, all countries of the world should participate in a solemn and certain non-aggression pact, and solemnly reaffirm their obligations to restrict and reduce armaments, and when the signatory countries can faithfully fulfill their obligations, each agrees not to send armed forces of any kind beyond its borders. Speaking in common sense, if any powerful country does not participate in the joint efforts for political and economic peace in Geneva and London with genuine sincerity, then progress will be blocked and will ultimately be unsuccessful. Under these circumstances, the civilized countries of the world that are currently seeking the above two ways of peace will know where the responsibility for failure lies. I wish that no country will assume this responsibility, and that the participants in these two major conferences will put their declared policies into practice. This is the path to political and economic peace, and I am certain that your government will participate in the achievement of these desires.</p>

<p>Militarists Alone Have Many Dissenting Opinions</p>
<h3 id="e46">Roosevelt's Telegram Reaches the Emperor of Japan; Japanese Government Takes a Cautious Attitude <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>International Conference Planned; Convention on Consultation Can Be Considered</p>
<p>Military Actions Across Borders Difficult to Acknowledge</p>
<p>Holding onto Manchuria, Reserving Rights to Expand Armaments</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Today, the spokesperson for the Japanese Army Ministry criticized President Roosevelt's declaration, stating that a guarantee of peace, which maintains the status quo without addressing environmental solutions, is unacceptable to Japan. Japan can agree to the proposal of not increasing armaments during meetings, but considers it unfortunate that countries cannot send troops beyond their borders, as this would hinder Japan's current actions in North China. The Foreign Ministry, besides recognizing the importance of the US President's remarks, declined to comment further, as the President's message was addressed directly to the Japanese Emperor. (17th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) US President Roosevelt's personal telegram guaranteeing peace arrived directly at the Imperial Palace this morning. Prime Minister Saitō and Foreign Minister Uchida immediately requested its release and, after discussing it with relevant ministries, will reply in the name of the Japanese government. The Japanese government will adopt a cautious attitude, avoiding explicit statements on their response policy before the message is released from the Imperial Palace. Therefore, the Japanese Foreign Ministry authorities have issued the following views on President Roosevelt's proposal in principle:</p>
<p>The British disarmament proposal is based on European standards and is not applicable to the Far East. However, before deliberating on the British proposal, Japan will maintain its insistence on first considering the Japanese proposal.</p>
<p>There is room for consideration of holding an international conference to establish a treaty of agreement in parallel with the Geneva Disarmament Conference.</p>
<p>Maintaining the status quo of armaments is not opposed in principle. However, according to the protocol, maintaining the security of Manchuria is necessary, so the minimum preparations and rights to expand related to this are reserved.</p>
<p>There is no objection to the impossibility of military actions across borders. However, the actions of Japanese troops on the Great Wall border originated from Chinese challenges and have no aggressive nature. If such defensive actions were also uniformly prohibited, it would not be suitable for the special circumstances of the Far East. (17th Den-tsu dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese Army authorities generally hold the following views on President Roosevelt's personal telegram guaranteeing peace. In principle, there is no objection to the US President's opinion. However, the Soviet Union's propaganda of communism and China's boycott of goods are the root causes of war, and it is difficult for Japan, which is adjacent to such countries, to accept the notion that Japanese troops should not cross borders, ultimately recognizing the special circumstances. Furthermore, there is still an important question: the meaning and relationship of invoking the so-called right of self-defense, which hinders the Non-Aggression Treaty, must be clarified. (17th Den-tsu dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The statement issued by US President Roosevelt to the heads of various countries was conveyed to the Foreign Ministry on the morning of the 17th by Debuchi, the Japanese ambassador to the UK. As there is no precedent for a US president to directly address the Japanese Emperor on diplomatic policy, the government has had various discussions and is currently considering the procedures to be adopted.

<h3 id="e47">Is the United States Factually Recognizing Soviet Russia? <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>(Washington) Although the White House denied today that the US President's appeal for a peace guarantee was directly sent to Soviet Russia as an indication of preparing a reply, many in Congress believe this is the first step towards resuming diplomatic relations. Several people even said that if Kalinin, the chairman of the Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union, also directly replies to the US President, it could be regarded as establishing diplomatic relations in legal terms. Several international law experts also stated that the US President's action already recognizes the Central Executive Committee as the de facto government of the Soviet Union. Senator Robinson, who usually speaks on behalf of the government in the Senate, while refusing to accept this broad meaning, also said that the President's message will definitely have an impact on the recognition issue. Furthermore, Bo, a Republican leader who has always advocated recognizing Soviet Russia, said that this move is a point towards practical clarity.</p>
<p>However, apart from views on legal terminology, officials and most members of Congress believe that the President may not immediately raise the issue of recognition. According to government advisors, if recognition is granted at this time, it may hinder the progress of the World Economic Conference, as several countries, even if they do not consider it an unfriendly act, will deem it impolite. However, it is believed that the President has allowed US representatives in London to freely exchange views with Soviet representatives, just like representatives from other countries.

<p>(Washington) People in the White House claimed that the direct delivery of President Roosevelt's appeal for world peace to Soviet Russia does not indicate a current plan for early recognition of Soviet Russia. The President did not think about the issue of recognition when issuing this appeal. However, it must be explained that the US representatives attending the World Economic Conference will freely talk with Soviet representatives, just like representatives from other countries.

<p>Forming a United Front to Deal with Aggressor Nations</p>
<p>(Washington) Both Democrats and Republicans called the declaration a significant and powerful document, but they differed in their interpretation of its intent. Friends of the government claimed that the President's intent was to persuade all countries to abandon political disputes and unite in support of the London Conference, as it is considered the most important international conference ever held.</p>
<p>Congressman Blanton, however, believes that the message is nothing short of a head-on blow to Japan, saying that the President's true intention is to persuade Japan to stop its unjust aggressive war against China. Although Japan is not mentioned in the message, the core of the message is that if armed forces are not sent out of one's own country, they will be publicly recognized as aggressors, which is implicitly directed at Japan. Blanton believes that the President's handling of the Far East situation is often very clever, so he does not believe this statement is directed at belligerent countries in South America.</p>
<p>Many more members of Congress, including Speaker Rayburn, believe that the main target of the message is Germany, as the message was issued when the Disarmament Conference was in a stalemate. However, as Rayburn stated, what the President proposed was to form a united front to deal with those engaged in military actions or those who are likely to engage in military actions, and Germany is certainly among them. The true meaning is self-evident, and it should be interpreted in conjunction with Blanton's words.</p>
<p>As for Roosevelt himself, he believes that his message is completely clear and does not need further explanation. Therefore, when sending the original text to Congress, he only attached a brief message, pointing out that economic and political stability is now threatened by selfish interests and the danger of conflict, and strongly advocating the necessity of reducing armaments and abandoning weapons of aggression. Most international disputes arise from fear of aggression by others. The message did not ask Congress to pass it, but only said it was for information only. (16th Kuo Min dispatch)</p>
<p>(Washington) The two articles published by President Roosevelt have been hailed by Congress as great and timely remarks, demonstrating the excellent character of world leaders. Speaker Rainey predicts that the American people will enthusiastically and unanimously support the proposal to stand on the same front to restrain aggressor nations. It is hoped that German Chancellor Hitler and his peers can accept the meaning and spirit of the US President's declaration. (16th Reuters dispatch)</p>

<p>French Newspapers Unanimously Disappointed</p>
<p>British Newspapers' Comments Show Differing Views</p>
<p>(London) President Roosevelt's declaration is welcomed by American public opinion, with one Boston newspaper even calling it a Magna Carta of humanity. However, French newspapers unanimously expressed disappointment, as the declaration did not indicate that the United States was prepared to jointly guarantee peace in Europe. The Parisian newspaper Le Journal stated that the US President is again asking us to disarm without an equal guarantee. A far-right French newspaper stated that it would be more beneficial if Hitler could resolutely issue a clear and decisive statement, as moderate words only mislead people. (17th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) British newspapers commented on President Roosevelt's declaration today, unanimously praising its spirit, but differing in their views on the value of these remarks in the overall European situation. The London Times stated that this is the most insightful statement advocating concerted action in the political and economic spheres, and is rarely heard from various countries. There is no doubt that it can receive the full support of the British Empire. However, this support may not be so easily obtained from several countries on the European continent. Although the US President has not been able to bind the United States to engage in armed intervention to protect the interests of the invaded, he has repeatedly stated the US's readiness to participate in consultation agreements, which is extremely important. The Hwi-wen-pao (News Summary) commented more realistically, saying that after the United States issued this declaration, it immediately canceled its position of not hearing about foreign affairs and has become somewhat bound. In the future, if there are those who violate the new peace promises, it will directly intervene to show its disapproval. The Dien-wen-pao (Telegraph News) and Chen-yu-pao (Morning Post) both mentioned that the United States did not guarantee peace in Europe and both said that what Europe needs is a guarantee that the United States will express its disapproval through practical intervention in the event of war. Most critics said that Hitler's remarks today could determine the fate of the Disarmament Conference. The first condition for progress in disarmament is that Germany abandons its demand to preserve a long-term conscript army. The future of disarmament depends solely on whether there is an indication in the German Chancellor's remarks that Germany can abandon this demand. The biggest test of Hitler's political skill will be seen in this speech. The Financial Times said that the meeting of German foreign creditors in Berlin is a sign that Germany cannot continue to remit money to repay its debts, but for truly impoverished debtor nations, it is more beneficial to future trade to provide them with some assistance than to force them to pay off their debts.

<h3 id="e51">Hitler's Important Speech <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>Firmly Demands Equality in Armaments</p>
<p>Constantly Thinking of Revising the Treaty</p>
<p>(Berlin) German Chancellor Hitler stated in his speech to the Reichstag today that he completely denies any intention of plunging Europe into another war, but there was an intense declaration that Germany is determined to restore its equal status in the international community. He then proclaimed that a European war cannot improve the current situation. Hitler bitterly attacked the Treaty of Versailles and its military and economic provisions, saying that Germany has suicidally fulfilled unreasonable reparations with loyalty. He also said that the Treaty of Versailles completely failed to make political borders coincide with natural borders. The inequality of the treaty was entirely caused by the prevailing mentality among the warring countries at the time, as major countries held preconceived notions, wanting to prove that Germany was the sole instigator of war. Hitler also denounced the League of Nations for losing its original purpose and becoming a tool for armed powers to maintain their authority, saying that the League of Nations has never given genuine assistance to weak countries. International agreements and accords only have genuine value between countries with equal international rights. Hitler warned of the crisis of communism destroying world culture, saying that a new war in Europe would only result in new sacrifices for all warring countries, leading to new insecurity and ultimately creating a situation of communist unrest. Hitler declared that revising the Treaty of Versailles is not only necessary in Germany's view, but other countries themselves have also anticipated that it will need to be revised. Hitler then elaborated on the three main goals of the National Socialist Party from the beginning, saying that the National Socialist revolution first sought to eliminate communism, second to solve Germany's unemployment problem, and third to establish a strong government to become an active collaborator in future agreements with other countries. He also said that Germany completely sympathizes with the same desires of other countries. German youth deeply know the suffering they have experienced and do not want to inflict this suffering on other countries. When discussing the necessity of revising the Treaty of Versailles, Hitler assured that Germany would not use force to break any agreements, even if the agreement clearly needs to be replaced by a better agreement, Germany does not want to use force to achieve it. The past fourteen years have shown that dividing the world into victors and vanquished only increases the suffering of all countries. Regardless of victory or defeat, they all suffer the same. Hitler also said that the Treaty of Versailles acknowledges that Germany can morally demand that other countries disarm. We do not want what we are unwilling to give to others. Hitler denied that the National Socialist Storm Troopers were an army, declaring that anyone who says that Germany has not honorably fulfilled all the disarmament clauses of the Treaty of Versailles is not being fair or accurate. He then welcomed the US President's declaration with the most enthusiastic language, claiming that Germany is ready to join any non-aggression pact, but then made a surprising statement, declaring that if Germany is not granted equality in armaments, Germany will withdraw from the League of Nations, because it is most difficult to force Germany to remain a member of the League of Nations as a second-class country. Germany cannot be forced to sign an agreement that will permanently prevent it from being a first-class country, and neither threats nor intimidation can impress the German people and government. Hitler concluded by declaring that if they want to deprive Germany of its due rights by a majority vote, Germany will be prepared to withdraw from any conference without hesitation. During Hitler's speech, applause frequently thundered from the seats of the deputies, including the former Crown Prince. The speech was unanimously adopted immediately after its conclusion.

<p>▲United Press Tokyo, 17th -- The Justice Department announced the details of the assassination case of Prime Minister Inukai, which shook Japanese politics, at 5 PM today. The Ministry of Interior also lifted the ban on reporting on it. The content is very long, totaling seventeen pages. The following is an excerpt of the outline:</p>
<h3 id="e85">(Purpose of the Assassination) <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>According to the confessions of the 47 arrested perpetrators, they were indignant at the corruption and degradation of political parties and the extreme tyranny of the Zaibatsu. They believed that such collusion of privileges and factions was unthinkable for the future of the country. In order to eliminate the traitors by the emperor's side and reform national politics, there was no other way but to use extraordinary means to overthrow political parties, Zaibatsu, and privileged classes. The comrades were planning this, and Inoue Akira (alias Shao) and others had already started working in February, assassinating Inoue Junnosuke (former Minister of Finance) and Dan Takuma (representative of Mitsui Zaibatsu). Many of their comrades had been arrested and could not carry out their ambitions. In March, they contacted the Blood Oath Corps Inoue and others to plan the May 15th Incident.</p>

<p>The work of the May 15th Assassination was divided into two aspects. The military was divided into three groups. The first group was further divided into two subgroups, A and B. Group A of the first group, led by Navy Lieutenant Commander Mikami Taku, along with Navy Reserve Ensign Kuroiwa, Yagi, Ishizeki, and Goto Eihan, gathered at Yasukuni Shrine, put on military uniforms, and traveled by car, going to the Prime Minister's official residence and the Metropolitan Police Department. At 5:40 PM, Lieutenant Commander Mikami personally opened fire and killed Prime Minister Inukai, and patrolmen Tanaka and Hirayama. Patrolman Tanaka died on the spot. Ensign Kuroiwa commanded officers and students to bomb the Metropolitan Police Department. Group B of the first group, led by Navy Lieutenant Commander Yamagishi, along with Navy Ensign Murayama, Shinohara, and Army Officer Cadets Nomura, assisted Group A in bombing the Prime Minister's official residence and the Metropolitan Police Department. The special duty of this group was to bomb the Bank of Japan. The second group was led by Navy Lieutenant Commander Koga, along with students from the Army Officer School Camp, Sakamoto, Nishikawa, and Ikematsu, who gathered in front of the graves of the Forty-Seven Ronin (loyal and righteous retainers of the Tokugawa era) at Sengakuji Temple. They split into groups to bomb the Metropolitan Police Department and Minister of the Imperial Household Makino. Koga threw a hand grenade at the gate of Minister Makino's residence and shot and wounded Patrolman Hashii. On the way from the Makino residence to the Metropolitan Police Department, they scattered leaflets along the way and threw a grenade at the Metropolitan Police Department, injuring Secretary Nagasaka and Takahashi, a reporter for the Yomiuri Shimbun. The third group was led by Navy Lieutenant Commander Nakamura, along with officer students Nakajima, Kaneshiro, and Min Yoshihara, who gathered at Shinbashi Station. They first bombed the Seiyukai headquarters, then drove to the Metropolitan Police Department. The three groups' actions all aimed at bombing the Metropolitan Police Department as their final destination. After achieving their goals, they went to the Tokyo Military Police headquarters to surrender, stating the details of their crimes. Twenty members of the Peasant Suicide Squad were all commanded by Tachibana Kosaburo, head of the Aikyo Juku, and Honma Kenichiro, head of the Shizan Juku, and were responsible for bombing the power plant and Mitsubishi Bank, and assassinating the rebel comrade Lieutenant Nishida. Their respective tasks were as follows: (1) The Tokyo Electric Yodobashi Power Plant was the responsibility of Onzui Hidenori, who threw a grenade at the cold water pipe at 7:40 PM. (2) The Tabata Power Plant was the responsibility of Hanawa Iohae, who threw a grenade at 7:10 PM, but it did not detonate. (3) The Kameido Power Plant was the responsibility of Yabuki Masami, who threw a grenade at 8:00 PM, but it did not detonate. He destroyed its transfer machine. (4) The Mejiro Power Plant was the responsibility of Komuro Rikiya, who threw a grenade at 7:00 PM, but was arrested. (5) The Hatogaya Power Plant was the responsibility of Yokosuka Kikuo, who threw a grenade at 7:00 PM and destroyed part of it. (6) The Kinu Electric Tokyo Power Plant was the responsibility of Onuki Akiharu and Takanezawa Ichi, who threw a hand grenade and destroyed its water bottle and transfer machine. (7) Mitsubishi Bank was the responsibility of Meiji University student Okuda Hideo, who threw two grenades at 7:00 PM and destroyed its glass windows. (8) The assassination of the rebel comrade Lieutenant Nishida was the responsibility of Kawasaki Nagamitsu, who shot Nishida, wounding him but not killing him.</p>

<p>Starting with the Blood Oath Corps assassinations, this bloody incident occurred on May 15th. The military perpetrators included 11 students from the Army Officer School and 16 naval officers, totaling 27. They surrendered that night. Most of the Peasant Suicide Squad were also arrested. However, Tachibana Kosaburo, head of the Aikyo Juku, and Haruta Nobuyoshi fled to Manchuria and were arrested on July 24th. Honma Kenichiro, head of the Shizan Juku, was arrested in Tokyo on September 18th. Okawa Shumei was arrested in a car on June 15th. Toyama Hidesan, head of the Tenko Society, and Dr. Maki and others were arrested on November 5th after intimidation. Yamada Chuichi, a student of the Aikyo Juku, was arrested twice for attempting to appeal directly to the Emperor for the pardon of his comrades, a total of five people. There were a total of 47 perpetrators directly related to the May 15th Incident. The list of their names is omitted.</p>
<p>▲Japan United Press -- All military criminals in this case surrendered themselves. However, civilian criminals fled separately after the incident. The following is a brief description of the investigation of its main characters.</p>
<p>Dr. Okawa Shumei, Doctor of Law: Okawa Shumei boarded a train from Tokyo Ueno Station to Aomori City on June 15, Showa 7, to attend a Shinbukan lecture. The Metropolitan Police Department suspected that he was involved in the May 15th incident, because he guided the young officers of the Army and Navy, and used explosives with the □□ Action Team. They dispatched five plainclothes officers to arrest Okawa on the train and got off at Ueno Station. He was then taken to the Metropolitan Police Department, and after the Prosecutor's Office investigated, he was detained in Ichigaya Prison, and was accused of violating the Explosives Control Act and of inciting murder.</p>
<p>Tachibana Kosaburo: Tachibana secretly went to Manchuria with his secretary, Haruta Nobuyoshi, after the incident. Haruta was arrested in Changchun and fled to Harbin, hiding in a Russian house. The Metropolitan Police Department sent seven police officers to Manchuria, but failed to capture Tachibana and only captured Haruta and returned him to Japan. Tachibana planned to rebuild the party headquarters in Harbin, but after his comrades were arrested one after another, Tachibana also felt the danger around him, and surrendered to the Harbin Military Police on July 24. Tachibana was the principal of Aikyo Juku. He established Aikyo Juku in his hometown of Mito. Because of his noble personality, the number of peasant children increased day by day. In Showa 5, he expanded the organization and named it "Self-Art Rural Labor School Aikyo Juku". The spirit he guides is to integrate the three principles of land, brotherhood, and labor. Its main purpose is to cultivate practical fighters who realize agrarian Japanese nationalism.</p>
<p>Toyama Hidesan, Chairman of the Tenko Society: Toyama Hidesan, the third son of the famous Toyama Mitsuru. As the Metropolitan Police Department did not know his whereabouts, after serious investigation, they learned that he was hiding in Suginami District, Tokyo. On November 5, they organized an armed team to surround his house and arrest Uratoyama and several of his men. At the same time, police officers were sent to the Tenko Society headquarters, Toyama Mitsuru's house, the National Ideology Research Association, and the East Asia Economic Bureau to discover pistols, Japanese swords, and other evidence.</p>

<p>▲Dentsu News Agency Tokyo, 17th -- Okawa Shumei and others, who were defendants as civilians in the May 15th Incident, could not be prosecuted for the crime of mutiny by the Army and Navy, so they were prosecuted for murder, attempted murder, and violation of the Explosives Control Act. Navy Captain Hama Yuji was ill, so he was dealt with separately. The other Army and Navy defendants were expected to be prosecuted for mutiny as planned.</p>

<p>▲Japan United Press Tokyo, 17th -- After the government announced the May 15th Incident, the political situation will change, which is a common observation among people. Therefore, the issue of Finance Minister Takahashi's advance or retreat is now attracting attention from all sides. Prime Minister Saito is considering various measures to extend the life of the cabinet and wants to retain the Finance Minister. The Prime Minister plans to observe the political situation for a few days after the announcement of the May 15th Incident, and will meet with the Finance Minister next week to persuade him to abandon his intention to resign.</p>

<p>▲Dentsu News Agency Tokyo, 17th -- The content of the May 15th Incident has been announced today. Prime Minister Saito did not express any feelings, because he feared a major social reaction. As for the Army's view on the announcement of the May 15th Incident, as some have argued, because the emergency has not yet been resolved, it cannot be a reason for the current cabinet to resign en masse.</p>

<p>▲Dentsu News Agency Tokyo, 17th -- After the May 15th Incident was announced, Navy Minister Ogaki recalled his feelings as follows: "Young officers were angry at the phenomena of the country and society, and such an incident occurred, which is very pitiful. Because of public anger and righteous indignation, they violated national law, and their direct actions cannot be tolerated. Moreover, it is fearful for active-duty soldiers to act according to their own will. It is only natural for us military personnel to uphold the Emperor's will and purify military discipline. Furthermore, the Japanese people should reflect on themselves, avoid making further mistakes, and strive for the best."</p>

<h3 id="e95">Japanese Troops Press on All Sides, Approaching Beiping and Tianjin, Situation is Serious <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>--- Convey</p>
<p>Enemy Crossing the Luan River, News East of Tangshan is Chaotic</p>
<p>Shixia Falls, Enemy Attacks Miyun, Our Troops Fight Hard</p>
<p>Beiping's City Defense is Tight, Sandbags Piled in Streets and Alleys</p>
<p>Beiping Special Dispatch: The Japanese army is harboring an extremely large conspiracy to invade and harass Beiping and Tianjin. The first step of their plan is to occupy Luanzhou in the east and capture Miyun in the west, so that the barriers of Beiping and Tianjin are completely removed and there is no danger to defend. The second step is to copy the rear roads of Beiping and Tianjin, cut off the connection between Beiping and Tianjin along the Pingyu Highway in the east, and attack the key towns of the Pinghan Road in the west to surround Beiping. When the second step of the plan is completed, the traitors who have been bought in advance will simultaneously carry out large-scale riots in Beiping and Tianjin, causing internal changes in Beiping and Tianjin, so as to achieve their conspiracy and reap the benefits. The first step of their plan has been completed, and the second step is underway. As for the purchase of traitors, although it has been greatly hit due to Zhang Jingyao's assassination, those of his kind who have not yet been captured are still extremely active. The Japanese army's purpose is to focus on the three northeastern provinces and Rehe and Chahar. If they can truly occupy the above provinces and complete their so-called Manchu-Mongolian policy, they can temporarily stop. Their various conspiracies against Guannei are nothing but attempts to achieve this goal. Therefore, if Beiping and Tianjin are lost, their approach will be different from the tricks they played in the three northeastern provinces. Our authorities regard Beiping and Tianjin as the lifeline of the north. If Beiping and Tianjin have any problems, not only the north will be shaken, but the whole country will also be shaken. They vowed to defend them with all their strength and contend with the powerful enemy. Now is a critical moment. Let's see how the situation develops in the next few days.</p>
<p>The Japanese and puppet troops who invaded again, that is, those who forced their way across the river on the 12th in separate routes, advanced towards Renzikou, Gaotaizi from Dongxizhai, and pressed towards Shaheyi after crossing the river from Lulong. The puppet army Li Jichun's troops were responsible for gradually pressing westward on the front of the railway. In the past two days, the enemy at Shaheyi has forced Leizhuang, Guye, and Gaotaizi to the west of Luanzhou in the south, and the enemy at Renzikou has attacked Fengrun. Because the rear road of Luanzhou area was threatened and feared to be heavily surrounded, our army has concentrated a large army in the Tangshan area since yesterday. He Zhuguo and Wan Fulin also moved to a certain place west of Tangshan to direct military affairs. The enemy army adopted an offensive method, and did not fight along the railway line. They are purely dividing their forces north of the railway to advance, and our army is also defending everywhere north of the railway line to prevent the enemy army from penetrating deeply, and fighting hard with the enemy. This morning (15th), the enemy army attacked Fengrun in a big way. Fengrun City has been bombed by enemy planes for several days, which is very tragic. There are about one division of our army in that area, and they are currently fighting fiercely. The enemy army is paying special attention to Fengrun, and is conspiring to occupy Fengrun, attack Song's troops in the north, and establish contact with the Japanese army at Xifengkou. To attack Yutian in the west, and force Tangshan in the south, threatening the rear of our army, so they must obtain Fengrun.</p>
<p>After the Japanese army in the Gubeikou area launched a full-line general attack, our army fought bravely and fought fiercely for three days and nights. Both sides suffered heavy casualties. Our army's position was completely destroyed due to the pressure of the enemy's airplanes, artillery, and tanks. Since yesterday, our army has withdrawn to the new position pre-constructed south of Shixia. Yesterday, the fierce battle lasted all day, and the enemy did not succeed. Today, the enemy's casualties were too heavy, and they were waiting for replenishment, and they did not launch a large-scale attack. The war was slightly gentler than in the past two days. Now, our army's front line is in the Jiusongling area, 30 miles north of Miyun, only more than 150 miles away from Beiping. In order to prevent the enemy army from advancing south, our army has transferred a large army to reinforce it, and has deployed defenses section by section south of Jiusongling, and the position is quite solid. From 5:00 AM this morning (15th), Japanese planes flew back and forth to Miyun five times to drop bombs, and used machine guns to strafe, causing losses to residents.</p>
<p>In order to intimidate our rear, the Japanese army sent planes to reconnaissance and drop bombs in various places every day. In addition to sending leaflets to Ping twice, they also sent five planes to Baoding for reconnaissance yesterday afternoon. This morning, three Japanese planes also dropped bombs in the Tangshan area, causing slight damage to the ground.</p>
<p>In Beiping, the situation has become increasingly serious in recent days. In order to prevent villains from taking the opportunity to harass, the authorities have piled sandbags in important streets and alleys since yesterday morning, and curfew has been imposed earlier at night. Last night, more than 400 suspicious traitors were found in small hotels and remote places. Secret symbols were found in their collars and under their arms, and they have been detained for strict investigation. The Japanese army originally planned to hold an exercise this morning, but seeing that our side was heavily guarded and fearing accidents, they temporarily stopped. Now, a large army has been stationed in the four suburbs of Beiping, and the defense is solid. All important places inside and outside Beiping city are also equipped with fortifications. If the enemy army invades, they will swear to fight to the death. Even if they turn the cultural area of thousands of years into ruins, they will not hesitate. In Tianjin, the authorities are also paying great attention to security and are strictly guarding against villains causing trouble. (15th)</p>
<h3 id="e96">Recent Trends in Bandit Suppression in Hubei Province <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>The Eastern Hubei Armies Have Completed Concentration and Awaiting Orders for General Suppression</p>
<p>Kong's Bandits Fled into Hubei in Two Routes, Repelled by Garrison Troops</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Since Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek instructed Liu Zhenhua, Commander-in-Chief of the Henan, Hubei and Anhui Border Area Bandit Suppression, to supervise bandit suppression in eastern Hubei, Liu came to Hankou and convened a bandit suppression meeting with Director He Chengjun to decide on strategies. Currently, although Liu is in Jiangxi visiting Chiang, the divisions of Wan Yaohuang, Liang Guanying, Hao Mengling, Shangguan Yunxiang, Liu Maoen, Li Sisu, Zhang Yinxiang, Tang Enbo, and Peng Zhenshan have all concentrated in the designated locations. As soon as Liu returns to Hanchuan, he can order a general suppression. The red bandits in that area sometimes merge and sometimes separate, and cannot be captured. The total number seems to be no less than 20,000, so there are bandits everywhere in the counties of southern Henan and eastern Hubei. Macheng and Huang'an are particularly precarious, because the bandit tracks are no more than eight miles away from Macheng County, and Huang'an has long been a bandit den, which bandits must contend for. Although Huangma is under the gaze of the Red Army, it has not dared to attack the county because of the gathering of the National Army, but the countryside has been disturbed. Such as Zhongguan Station, Futian River, Yan Family River, Sanhekou, Shunheji, Songziguan, Changgangling, Qiting, Songbu, and other places, the advance and retreat of the bandits has caused great harm to the people, and many have abandoned farming and fled. Wherever the bandits go, in addition to the tragic massacre of the masses and the surrounding of the regimental guns, they also try their best to destroy the traffic. The Hanma telephone line has recently been cut off, and cars are not allowed to pass. Other places are too numerous to mention. In western Hubei, He's bandits are the mainstay. According to a telegram from Sun Bin, the magistrate of Wufeng County, the bandits have a large-scale eastward fleeing appearance. Xu Yuanquan has urgently returned to Shashi to make arrangements. There are three ways for the bandits to go: 1. To flee to Sangzhi, the old nest in western Hunan, through Yuyangguan, 2. To flee to the Shaanxi border through Yexiguan via Badong along northern Hubei, and join forces with Xu's bandits. 3. To flee along the Yangtze River into Honghu, and then invade the counties in central Hubei. However, the Hunan army guarded the danger and stationed troops, so it was really impossible to enter Hunan. To flee to the Shaanxi border, it is difficult to achieve its goal due to road repairs and obstructions. Therefore, developing to the east may be its most recent goal. Its two attempts to send bandits to invade Honghu are sufficient proof. Now Xu has arrived in Shashi, and will supervise the division's advance to suppress them, and will also be responsible for clearing the scattered bandits in the border area. Xu has long been in command of the army and is known as a famous general. He's bandits have been repeatedly defeated and fear him like a tiger. Kong's bandits in southern Hubei have recently been defeated by the Hunan army. They once attempted to enter Hubei in two routes. One route was the entire 7th Division of the Pseudo 16th Army, which collapsed towards Tongshan. One route was the entire 9th Division of the Pseudo 17th Army, which collapsed towards Yangxin. The National Army stationed in Tongshan was Xie Bin's New 10th Division, and the National Army stationed in Yangxin was Guo Rudong's 26th Division, who tried their best to resist the battle, and the bandits were unsuccessful. According to a telegram from Xie's department, the bandits fled back to the Jiangxi border. (16th)</p>

<p>Dispatching Inspectors to be Permanently Stationed at the Bureau for Office Work</p>
<p>Guangdong Postal Workers Union Forms Investigation Team to Assist</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence, Propaganda Group of the Southwest Executive Department: Considering the severity of the national crisis recently, and the difficulty in ensuring that important cities in the Southwest are free of spies, in order to strictly prevent such occurrences, in addition to separately establishing methods for handling telegram inspections, with regards to the inspection of mail, a special request has been submitted to the Southwest Executive Department, instructing the Southwest Political Affairs Committee to instruct the provincial governments of the Southwest to order the public security bureaus and county governments to dispatch officials to be permanently stationed at post offices to strictly inspect all incoming and outgoing mail in their respective localities, according to the following measures: (1) Mail concerning military, diplomatic, or national defense secrets should be immediately detained; (2) Mail concerning secret communication with communist bandits should be immediately detained; (3) Mail with reactionary wording or suspicious signs should be immediately detained; (4) Mail detained by inspectors should be confidentially submitted to the local government for investigation; (5) The local government should immediately investigate such mail, and report important cases to higher authorities. The Guangdong Provincial Government received this order yesterday, ordering the Provincial Capital Public Security Bureau to dispatch personnel to the post office for inspection within a specified time limit. Furthermore, in order to assist party and government agencies in inspecting mail, the local postal workers' union has recently organized a special postal workers' mail investigation team, consisting of one team leader and four small team members. Membership is open to all union members until the quota is filled. The team leader is responsible for the team's affairs under the orders of the postal workers' union. The small team leaders are responsible for managing team members and supervising their respective small teams in carrying out inspections and investigating reactionary propaganda mail and the smuggling of inferior goods using postal packages. If party and government agencies have matters to entrust to the postal workers' union, the union will instruct the team leader to execute them. If any team member discovers suspicious mail or violations of the aforementioned items, they must report them level by level to higher authorities for review. (10th day)</p>

<p>On June 21st of last year, in the case of the daylight robbery of the Xingye Bank, four suspects, Niu Jinpu, Ji Yiming, Liu Ziqing, and Niu Guo's wife, were apprehended and sent to the court for investigation. A public prosecution was previously filed, and the court has convened multiple times. Niu Jinpu's testimony completely denied the charges. Today (17th) at 10 a.m., the case was brought up again for continued interrogation. Bank employees Lu Xifan and Li Lingyan appeared in court to testify. Judge Zhang Yihuang questioned Niu and the others extensively, but they still claimed innocence and flatly denied the charges. Bank employee Lu Xifan stated that at the time, four people approached, two with guns and two with knives threatening their chests, and the robbers' faces were difficult to discern. Li Lingyan also stated that a year had passed and their memory was hazy. Subsequently, Zhang Baopei, the appointed lawyer for Niu Guo's wife, made a statement requesting her release. The judge then ordered her to be released on bail with a cash deposit of 200 yuan, pending a scheduled debate. The court adjourned, and Niu and the others were returned to custody.</p>

<p>Banditry Rampant Again in Various Areas of Taihu Lake</p>
<p>Recently, banditry has become rampant again in various areas of Taihu Lake. He Sanbao, a fisherman from Hengjing Xuzhuang, Shilubang, was fishing by boat on the morning of the 15th when he was suddenly abducted along with his boat by lake bandits. After receiving the report, the first squadron of the stationed Pan-Lake Police immediately led officers and informants, disguised, into the lake to search. On the morning of the 16th, they spotted a bandit boat outside Maoqi Port. Unexpectedly, the bandits on the boat, seeing the police boat following, knew things were not good and opened fire first. A fierce battle ensued for half an hour. Unable to withstand the police, the bandits were apprehended on the spot, including Xu Jinfang, Gao Desheng, and Zhang Zhiqiang, along with a pistol and seven bullets. It was also discovered that the bandit boat was He Sanbao's original boat. However, the hostage, He Sanbao, had already been killed by stray bullets.

<p>Urgent Appeal to Abolish Diesel Tax</p>
<p>Since the oil refining industry was first invented in Guangdong Province, factories have been established in various places, with this city being the most developed. At its peak, there were more than 50 refineries. Recently, due to the dumping of Russian oil and the repeated price drops of kerosene from companies like Meiya, the oil refining market has plummeted. Refiners have been unable to maintain operations, and two-thirds have closed down. Furthermore, the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Finance has dispatched a special commissioner to establish a bureau in this city to collect oil refining business tax, which refiners already find difficult to bear. Unexpectedly, the customs authorities have also proposed levying an import tax on diesel oil of 2.90 gold units per ton. If used for refining kerosene, an additional 23.40 gold units will be levied. Oil refineries believe that the current cost of raw materials is already expensive and unprofitable. If this new tax is implemented, the oil refining industry will be destroyed. Jiangsu province's oil refiners Yongji Xu Shutang, Dahua Wei Haoran, Meili Zhou Yongnian, Limin Ding Jiefu, Zhonghua Qiang Fengqi, etc., in order to safeguard the livelihoods of the poor and reclaim rights and interests, jointly submitted a petition to the Jiangsu Provincial Self-Refined Kerosene Business Tax Bureau yesterday, requesting that it be forwarded to the Department of Finance and various ministries and courts, citing the Guangdong precedent, to immediately abolish the new diesel tax, so that the dying refiners of Jiangsu province may have a chance to recover.</p>
<h3 id="e104">Truth Revealed in the Swallowing Stolen Pigs Case <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>Yang Zuxun, the head of the fourth Jia of the Fifth District Sitou Town Security Corps, and others, the case of swallowing the stolen pigs, the situation has been briefly described in this newspaper. It is now known that on the twelfth day of last month at midnight, the pig boat of boatmen Liu Afa and Wang Laowu was robbed at Shangshun Bridge, Zhangjing, Fifth District of this city. Yang Zuxun, the head of the Jia, happened to be leading the corps members near the No. 3 Bridge on Xicheng Road and intercepted two stolen boats and thirty-eight large pigs. Wang Mingshan, the class leader of the Jia, and Zhang Panquan, the corps member, discussed selling the large pigs the next morning to Tan Yaobing's butcher shop in Sitou Town for nine pigs, Shen Bohua's butcher shop for nine pigs, and Lu Julin's butcher shop for three pigs, for a total of 479.5 yuan. The remaining fifteen pigs were sent to the district corps headquarters. The owner, Wang Laowu, paid 105 yuan to redeem thirteen pigs. After April 20th, County Magistrate Yan learned of the matter from a newspaper report and secretly ordered Wu Deqing, the director of the Public Security Bureau, and Song Zhentao, the director of the Security Corps, to investigate. Director Song immediately sent instructor Zhang Qisen to the countryside for a secret investigation, which revealed that the incident did occur. County Magistrate Yan then summoned Jiang Jiayou, the district corps leader, corps member Li Guohua, Zhang Panquan, Zhu Shengyang, instructor Ge Zhen, and butcher shop owners Tan Yaobing, Lu Julin, You Zixun, and butcher Zou Ahe to the case one after another. Yao Fusun, a staff member of the secretariat, opened a court and repeatedly interrogated them. Each person knew that it was difficult to conceal the truth and revealed the truth. At the same time, boatman Liu Afa also surrendered and stated the process. Until the previous (15th) day, Yang Zuxun, the head of the fourth Jia, also knew that the matter had been exposed and surrendered himself to the county, directly admitting to selling the pigs, only claiming that he intended to buy firearms with the money. He also claimed that after the county committee sent a secret investigation to the countryside, he entrusted instructor Ge Zhen to come to the city for activities. According to instructor Ge, he once contacted Zhang Qisen, a secret investigator of the county Security Corps, and Zhang demanded an activity fee of 800 yuan. Because the amount was too large, it was not successful. Later, Hu Bin (Zhen Qian), the current section chief of the Second Section of the Public Security Bureau, learned of the matter and invited Yu to meet at the Donghu Hotel. Hu said that he could find a way, and Yu had a close relationship with Yang and could not refuse, so he temporarily accepted it and stored it in the Donghu Hotel, intending to return the original items after the case was over. The 150 yuan in silver was not received. After the confession, Hu immediately called the Donghu Hotel and ordered the tea room to send the goldware to the county for presentation. Finally, Yao questioned Yang Zuxun again, and it was not until 11:00 p.m. that it was over. As a result, the court ordered Hu Bin, Yang Zuxun, and Ge Zhen to be taken care of together. At the same time, the director of the Security Corps, Song Zhentao, was ordered to transfer Zhang Qisen to the case for interrogation and detention yesterday, and County Magistrate Yan ordered Hu Bin to be dismissed. The vacant position was concurrently filled by Ji Nianru, the section chief of the First Section of the Public Security Bureau.

<p>Fish Tax Increase Leads to Fish Market Strike</p>
<p>This year's yellow croaker season, the Wan Sheng He Xing Zeng Shun Yi Long fish markets in Beiwai Sha increased the price of each fish voucher by six points (fish market by fish customers telescopic), according to the original price of a total of 6.3 jiao, another levy on the Relief Institute charity fee copper coin one. After various objections, the Party and Government Talks Association decided to allow an increase of three points, another levy on the charity fee copper coin three, by the county announcement, so that the fish market should follow. Unexpectedly, the resistance does not comply, and on the 15th County Magistrate Ruan was transferred to the fish market representatives Lu Jun Chao, Yang Fengwu, Lu Guanhua, Shen Liangshu and others, face to face persuasion ineffective, that is, the police to watch over the application for provincial orders for review. Yesterday (16th), the fish markets were successively closed, and farmers from the four villages who went to buy yellow croaker were in vain. In the afternoon, some fish market employees, holding incense sticks, went to the Chamber of Commerce to petition, requesting to reason with the Relief Institute. During the disturbance, Yang Zhiping, a reporter from a certain tabloid, was beaten and injured and went to Renji Hospital for treatment. Later, after the efforts of Yin Zhongren of the Chamber of Commerce and others to mediate, they agreed to negotiate with County Magistrate Ruan, restore the freedom of Lu Junchao and others, and compromise on the price increase regulations, and the fish market opened as usual, and the staff dispersed.</p>

<p>Japanese Warship Sails into Zhapu</p>
<p>On the 15th, near dusk, two warships were discovered on the sea off Zhapu, speeding from outside Caiqi Gate. The hulls were all black and gradually entered the restricted area. Finally, they docked outside the Tianfei Palace on the sea embankment. The people of Zhapu thought they were domestic cruisers, but upon closer inspection, they saw that the flags of Japan were hanging at the stern of the ships. One ship also clearly stated "Dai Nippon No. 27 Destroyer". Each ship was equipped with four large cannons and eight or nine small cannons. There were many soldiers in the cabins. The people of Zhapu were greatly alarmed upon seeing this and rushed to inform the local security team soldiers. At that time, the ships lowered sampans and openly landed soldiers, totaling four soldiers and one sailor, but all were in plainclothes. The team soldiers stepped forward and politely advised them to return to the ship, but these people glared fiercely and were unreasonable. One of them, speaking Chinese, said they wanted to seek medical treatment and buy fruit. The team soldiers had no choice but to accompany them to the main street, where they bought a small amount of oranges and other items, but did not seek medical treatment. They strolled around for a long time before reluctantly returning to the ship, weighing anchor and leaving. Some said that they also saw a giant ship anchored in the outer sea that had not sailed in. That night, all districts of this county, upon hearing the news, intensified their vigilance.</p>

<p>Four People Drown While Testing Water Volume</p>
<p>The seawall along the Qiantang River has been in disrepair for many years, and the stone embankments along the dike are often eroded by the tides. In order to protect the embankment, the Water Conservancy Bureau specially set up a sluice gate, the Xixing Temporary Engineering Office, and the Water Conservancy Bureau for Repairing and Maintaining Rivers. In order to prevent contractors from cutting corners, Su Huanxiang, an official, was specially dispatched to supervise the section. On the afternoon of the 13th, at about 1:00 p.m., Su, along with Shao Lieqiao, the son of contractor Shao, and seven sailors, were on a sampan testing the depth of the water when the tide suddenly surged, capsizing the sampan. Four of the seven drowned. The bodies of Shao Lieqiao, Su Huanxiang, and two workers drifted to the river mouth and have not been found. It was not until about 5:00 p.m. that the bodies were recovered on the Xixing Riverbank.</p>

<p>After the meeting began with customary formalities, Chairman Wang Hanliang first gave a speech, stating that the association, in order to promote national goods and resist foreign goods, held the First National Goods Movement Propaganda Meeting on April 9. However, because practical work has not shown much effectiveness, a second propaganda meeting is being held today. The purpose is to enable national goods to be sold well at home and abroad, and to solve the current domestic business difficulties. It is hoped that all those present will do their best to publicize, and at the same time, fundamentally realize the true meaning of today's meeting.</p>

<p>Next, Ji Zejin, Secretary of the International Trade Bureau, gave a speech, stating that in recent years, the sales of national goods in our country have been sluggish, and imported goods have flooded the market, resulting in a leakage of hundreds of millions of dollars every year. The reasons for this are nothing more than the dumping of foreign goods in China, the binding of our country's tariffs by treaties, and the lack of organization of domestic enterprises. Therefore, national goods are difficult to compete with foreign goods. If this continues, the future of national goods in our country is very dangerous. The International Trade Bureau of the Ministry of Industry, in order to save</p>

<p>China's industry and promote the sales of national goods, has specifically formulated opinions for the reference of national goods manufacturers: (1) "Dumping of Foreign Goods". After the European War, various countries worked hard to produce. Internally, they reduced export taxes and encouraged exports, and externally, they increased import taxes to make it difficult for foreign goods to enter and compete with their domestic industries. As a result, production became increasingly developed, with supply exceeding demand. The domestic market could not accommodate these surplus goods, so in order to save their economic panic, they had to seek markets abroad to accommodate their surplus products. China's industry is backward and its population is large, making it the only large market for foreign powers to sell goods. Therefore, various countries compete for the exclusive right to this market, dumping their goods on each other. Our country's nascent industry is naturally difficult to compete with cheap and high-quality foreign goods. Therefore, our national goods are greatly impacted. In order to save the national goods industry, the Ministry of Industry has sent special personnel to investigate the situation of foreign goods dumping in China, and then levy anti-dumping duties to restrict them, and use various methods to prevent foreign goods from dumping in China. (2) "China has no tariff protection". Before the outbreak of the European War, after the United Kingdom adopted free trade, because of the fierce competition for dumping in foreign markets, the United Kingdom changed its policy, abandoned the free dumping plan, and implemented protective tariffs. It made every effort to promote emerging industries and imposed extremely high taxes on newly imported industrial products from foreign countries to restrict their import. In China, due to the constraints of various treaties, it cannot compete with other countries, and China's industrial level is still in its infancy. Under this pressure, it is even more difficult to develop. The remedies are divided into (A) increasing import taxes and (B) After the 15th of this month, the Sino-Japanese tariffs have been abolished, and imported goods will be subject to surcharges, which is also a good opportunity to promote national goods. (3) "Chinese National Goods Commit Suicide Due to Competition". Domestic national goods manufacturers reduce prices and sell cheaply due to competition from the same industry. Because of price reductions and cheap sales, the manufacturers' profits are reduced, and various malpractices occur: (A) Factories go bankrupt due to losses, (B) Aspiring industrialists who follow are hesitant to move forward, (C) Price reductions and cheap sales require reducing costs, so each manufacturer cuts corners, resulting in the goods produced losing the trust of users, giving foreign goods an opportunity to intervene. The remedies are divided into (A) National goods factories should unite and supervise each other, so that the prices of all products have certain standards for raw materials and manufacturing, and (B) The Ministry of Industry should have measures to reward industry. (4) "Difficulty in Distinguishing Between National Goods and Foreign Goods" (Fault Lies with National Goods Factories) National goods manufacturers, in order to take advantage of the psychology of the general public with shallow knowledge who prefer to buy foreign goods, use markings similar to those of foreign goods in various products, or do not add Chinese characters on them. As a result, the general knowledgeable class or those who love national goods feel difficult to distinguish. The remedies are divided into (A) should be banned, (B) All national goods should promote the characteristics of China to make it easier for Chinese people to recognize them. (5) "Foreign Goods Impersonate National Goods". Most of the foreign goods imported into China do not have the manufacturer's name and markings, or even change their appearance and blend in, adding the words "Made in China" and adding Chinese trademarks, making it difficult for Chinese people to distinguish between genuine and fake, which in turn makes the national goods market stagnant. This is also a major reason why national goods cannot be dumped. The remedies are divided into (A) Starting in 1934, all foreign goods imported into China will be marked with the country and place of manufacture, (B) Or give inspection, inspection of the consular certificate regarding the source of the goods, if it can be implemented accordingly, national goods can be revitalized.</p>

<p>Next, Wu Zhihao gave a speech, saying that everyone who comes here should know that Chinese people should buy Chinese goods. The reason why North China fell into the hands of the Japanese is that foreign goods were dumped, giving the Japanese economic control. At the same time, they used the money they took from exchanging goods to make guns to fight us. Let us think about how they treat us. The Chinese people should maintain their existing happiness and do their best to use national goods. Chen Binghui, Wang Honghui, Cao Zhigong, and others then gave speeches. The wording is omitted.</p>

<p>The original text of the oath is: "We swear from today to make a great determination to promote national goods, use national goods, and not buy or sell enemy goods or foreign goods. If we break our oath, we are willing to be subjected to the most severe punishment. We solemnly swear."</p>

<p>In order to make the true meaning of promoting national goods clear to the entire city, the association specially invited Yu Zhongxian to give a speech on "National Goods Save the Country" at the Great China Radio Station at 1:00 p.m. yesterday. The original text is: "It is the natural and just responsibility of the people of a country to use their own country's goods. In the world, no country needs a few people to persuade the majority to use its domestic products. Therefore, our movement to promote national goods and encourage the use of national goods is simply a very abnormal thing. However, there are two major parts of the reason for creating abnormality. First, the country is too weak and the doors are open. Foreign goods, no matter what they are, can be imported for dumping. The government is facing financial difficulties and wants to earn more money from tariff revenue, regardless of whether the imported goods conflict with domestic products. It only knows that foreigners' imported goods are willing to pay taxes in accordance with the regulations, so it allows them to enter and compete with our existing domestic goods. As a result, foreign goods flood the market and use dumping methods to reduce prices and fight with us desperately. It is a pity that the domestic industry's fragile foundation cannot withstand the destruction. Therefore, the weak industrial products can only be destroyed. Foreign goods can run rampant in the market. On this point, we can only hope that the government will restrict the import of foreign goods. For industrial products that are already produced domestically, at least to a certain extent, when importing foreign goods of the same type as those already produced domestically, the tariffs should be levied extra heavily, so that after they are imported, they can no longer be discounted for dumping. This is the way to incubate and protect domestic industrial products." The Section</p>
<h3 id="e120">No Statement of Suspension of Business in Banking and Finance Sectors in Peiping and Tientsin <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>Recently, there have been rumors that due to the increasingly tense situation in North China, the banking and finance sectors in Peiping and Tientsin will suspend operations. Yesterday, a reporter inquired about this matter with a person in charge of a bank in this city. According to him, the tense situation in Peiping and Tientsin has indeed affected the local financial sector to a considerable extent. However, the rumor of a complete suspension of business is an overstatement. The financial center of the country is in Shanghai, not Peiping and Tientsin, and the banking and finance businesses in Peiping and Tientsin are branches of Shanghai institutions. The Shanghai institutions have no such intention. The rumor is evidently untrue when verified with the opinions of the banking and finance sectors in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Second, the education of the past few decades should also bear significant blame. This is because the education in recent decades has excessively emphasized superficiality and neglected practicality. Educational policies have focused on outward appearances rather than inner development. The fundamentals of self-reliance, such as diligence and thrift, are not mentioned; instead, extravagance is promoted. The younger generation disdains domestic goods as being unsophisticated and considers foreign goods to be fashionable. Especially intellectuals and wealthy individuals with numerous concubines disregard domestic products entirely. Those with knowledge and wealth are considered the upper class. If those in positions of influence are unwilling to promote domestic products, their sales will undoubtedly suffer. Therefore, those responsible for education should take practical responsibility to subtly influence and train young people in diligence and thrift. Diligence eliminates extravagant thoughts, and thrift makes one not particular about whether something is unsophisticated or not. Our country is founded on agriculture, but even the basic necessity of food is now dependent on foreign goods. The import of rice and wheat is substantial every year, and the domestic prices of rice and wheat are controlled by whether or not foreign rice and wheat are imported. This is extremely dangerous. If a maritime blockade were to occur, wouldn't the country descend into panic due to food shortages? The clothes and other goods used in society, a large portion of which are foreign. In recent years, even the food we eat contains foreign ingredients. However, to rectify this problem, local officials must take responsibility and implement virtuous policies to encourage the people to engage in agriculture, eliminating the cultivation of all non-agricultural products. At the same time, no land should be left uncultivated. In rice and wheat-producing regions, transportation should be developed, so that rice and wheat production is sufficient, and we do not need to rely on foreign goods. Only then can the people's food supply be stabilized. We must use domestic goods to live and work in peace. The current unrest in society and the prevalence of bandits and kidnappers are due to the decline in production and the large number of unemployed people. These unemployed individuals have only two paths: to sit and starve to death or to take risks. The pervasive sense of crisis in society is caused by a portion of the unemployed taking the second path. To alleviate the terror surrounding us, we must strive to use domestic goods, revitalize domestic industries, provide jobs for the unemployed, and ensure that everyone has work, which will lead to social stability. In the past, people often spoke of "domestic troubles and foreign invasions," but the extent of the foreign invasion was merely speculation. Now, the reality of foreign invasion is clearly exposed. Our neighboring country, Japan, with its unlimited aggressive ambitions and wolf-like troops, has invaded our heartland. The four northeastern provinces have been completely lost, and Peiping and Tientsin are also in imminent danger. Half of our great country has been taken. In this critical moment of survival, the entire nation must unite and invigorate, improving industry, agriculture, military preparedness, and politics, and putting everything on the right track. Even if we are currently experiencing national humiliation and territorial loss, we can recover our lost territories and wash away our national shame in five or ten years. We, the people, must unite and work together to find a way out. This means loving and using domestic goods, because loving domestic goods means loving the country, and using domestic goods means supporting domestic industries. No matter how cheap foreign goods are, we will not buy them. No matter how beautiful foreign goods are, we will not use them. If money does not flow out of the country, the nation's vitality will not be depleted, and everything can be strengthened. At the same time, we must resolve to boycott Japanese goods. This will eliminate Japan's current display of power, rendering all its warships and cannons ineffective. Japan's finances rely on us. If we impose a long-term economic blockade on Japan, it will create chaos within the country. Therefore, to save our country, we must not buy Japanese goods, which is a bloody path to destroy Japan. To save the country and not become subjugated people, we must rely on ourselves, awaken our conscience, and take the path of using domestic goods. To destroy Japan and avenge our national and personal humiliation, the entire nation must unite and boycott Japanese goods.</p>

The Kailuan Mining Bureau in this city received a telegram from the Luanzhou Mining Bureau yesterday, stating that warfare has broken out in the mining area and that coal ships from Shanghai to Qinhuangdao should not depart. The bureau, upon receiving the telegram, has ordered the ships scheduled to depart for Qinhuangdao this morning to suspend operations.

<p>Totaling Five Thousand Eight Hundred and Forty-Three Boxes from Four Institutions</p>
<p>Arrived in Shanghai; Guangli Steamer on Sichuan Road Already Dispatched for Transport</p>
<p>The National Palace Museum in Peiping has already transported four batches of antiquities to Shanghai. Now, the fifth batch was transported south from Peiping on the 16th in three trains. Yesterday afternoon, a reporter from the Kuo Wen News Agency visited the warehouse at 26 Rue des Soeurs, Catholic Church Street, in this city to inquire. The reporter met with Xiang Jiajun, the warehouse manager, and obtained the following information.</p>
<h3 id="e124">Five Batches of Antiquities <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>According to Xiang, the five batches of antiquities total 5,843 boxes, transported south on three trains. The station has received a telegram stating that they are expected to arrive in Pukou tonight (the 18th) or tomorrow morning (the 19th). The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has already dispatched the Guangli steamer to transport them. The antiquities belong to four institutions: (1) The Palace Museum (2,412 boxes), (2) The Ministry of Interior Exhibition Hall (3,000 boxes), (3) The Summer Palace of the Peiping Municipal Government (343 boxes), and (4) The Temple Management Office (88 boxes), totaling 5,843 boxes. Including the previous four batches, there are a total of over 13,000 boxes.</p>
<h3 id="e125">Stored on Sichuan Road <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>With the five batches of antiquities being transported south, Yu Tongkui, the Director of General Affairs of the Palace Museum, Director Lu of the Ministry of Interior, and Liu Minjun of the Executive Yuan are escorting them. As for the storage location, the Central Bank has leased a warehouse at 32 Sichuan Road, conveniently located behind the Java-China-Japan Lijn. However, the space is limited, with a maximum capacity of 5,000 boxes, so the remaining boxes will remain at this location (26 Rue des Soeurs). The fifth batch is the last batch, and there will likely be no more antiquities transported south.</p>
<h3 id="e126">Categories of Antiquities <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>Among the five batches of antiquities, from the Palace Museum's perspective, there are still many documents, books, bronzes, and jade objects. The archives have already been completely transported. As for the rumored Jade Buddha of Tuan Cheng, it is unlikely to be in this shipment; otherwise, it would have been mentioned in the telegram. The categories of antiquities from the Ministry of Interior Exhibition Hall are unknown, but based on their usual location, the items displayed in the Wenhua, Wuying, Taihe, Zhonghe, and Baohe Halls in the past are all part of the Exhibition Hall's collection.</p>

<p>China Merchants Bureau plans to borrow £350,000 from the British Boxer Indemnity Fund to purchase six ships for expanding its routes. After negotiations with the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Fund Board of Trustees, a preliminary decision has been made to use the six newly purchased ships and over 200 mu of land owned by China Merchants Bureau within a concession as collateral for the loan. The Boxer Indemnity Fund Council will submit this loan proposal for discussion at the sixteenth meeting of the Board of Trustees next month on the 5th.</p>

<p>Finance Minister Song Ziwen entrusted the Siemens Foreign Firm in this city to install a China-Europe wireless telephone at his private residence in the French Concession. After repeated tests, the results are satisfactory, and direct communication with countries in Europe and America is now possible.

<p>The Shanghai Abolish Internal War Grand Alliance received a telegram yesterday from Deng Xihou, the commander of the Fourteenth Route Army, stating that Wang Xiaolai, Lin Kanghou, Du Yuesheng, Wu Daquan, Liu Zhanen, and other gentlemen from the Shanghai Abolish War Grand Alliance, as well as the Abolish War Grand Alliance headquarters, were informed that he had sent a telegram to the central government and the nation on the 14th (full text recorded separately) and requested their perusal. He has always admired the association's concern for the national crisis and efforts to stop internal conflicts. He, Deng Xihou, has always loved peace and disdained internal warfare. However, the more he retreats, the more Liu Wenhui advances, causing extreme anger among the troops that is difficult to contain. At this time of national peril, he disregards everything. The gentlemen are beacons of peace, and many are responding to the call. It is hoped that you will take effective measures to stop those who initiate war without reason to uphold justice. Sichuan is fortunate. He hastily sends this telegram to your esteemed attention. His brother, Deng Xihou, respectfully bows. Upon receiving the telegram, the association telegraphed Liu Wenhui, the Chairman of Chengdu, expressing great distress over the outbreak of the Sichuan war and urging him to rein in his horse and immediately cease hostilities. [Sent by] Abolish Internal War Association Headquarters.</p>
<p>Deng Mingjie and others, the representatives of Liu Xiang stationed in Shanghai, received a telegram from Liu Xiang yesterday, stating that Deng Mingjie and Fu Zhen, my brothers in Shanghai, are confidants. The strained relationship between Zi (Liu Wenhui's alias) and Jin (Deng Xihou's alias) has been previously telegraphed. Subsequently, telegrams were sent to both parties, asking them to cease conflict and resist foreign aggression. Recently, he received a telegram from Jin Kang (Deng Xihou), stating that Zi (Liu Wenhui) had divided his troops into four routes, attacking Pijiang, Guankou, Xindu, and Xinfan, and that fierce fighting was currently underway, as well as another force advancing towards Zile, requesting that public justice be upheld and the perpetrators punished. At a time when the nation is facing difficulties and Sichuan is still unsettled, all of our comrades should unite and jointly resist foreign aggression to defend our homeland. Unfortunately, internal strife has occurred, and it is truly regrettable. If the conflict continues for a long time, it will affect Tian Jun's efforts to suppress bandits, and the consequences will be dire. In addition to telegraphed reports to both Wang and Jiang, seeking their guidance, he is currently working hard to mediate, eliminate the flames of war, and stabilize the region. This is the purpose of this telegram. [Signed] Liu Xiang.</p>

<p>Mu Shu Again Transfers Longevity Gifts to Northeastern Righteous Armies</p>
<p>The Pudong Native Place Association solicited donations for the Northeastern Righteous Armies and refugees, entrusted to the Pudong Bank for collection. Since July of the tenth year [of the Republic], the donations have been submitted to the Northeastern Relief Association in nine installments, totaling 14,600 yuan, to be directly managed by Mr. Zhu Ziqiao. The association's enthusiasm for soliciting donations is highly commendable. Mu Junshu, a former township director of Yangsi Bridge in Pudong, has been living in seclusion in He County, enjoying the scenery. This year marks his sixtieth birthday, and friends and relatives came to celebrate and present longevity gifts, totaling 2,526 yuan. Mu Jun respectfully declined, saying that those who wish to wish him longevity should donate to the Northeastern Righteous Armies. Yesterday, he sent the money through the Pudong Native Place Association to be directly managed by Mr. Zhu Ziqiao.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Office Has Prepared to Depart Early</p>
<p>Yesterday, a Letter Was Sent to the New Drug Association Requesting Donations of Medical Supplies</p>
<p>The Shanghai office of the China Relief Hospital for Wounded and Disabled Soldiers on the Front Lines received a telegram from the general hospital in Peiping, stating that the war on the front lines has intensified, wounded soldiers are everywhere, and it is urgent to find ways to rescue them and send Chen Zhen, the director of the investigation department, to Shanghai to lead the team north. After receiving the order, the office has intensified the training of the first brigade of the ninth team and decided to depart around the 20th of this month. Details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e133">Telegram Urging from the Front <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai office received a telegram from the general hospital in Peiping yesterday, stating, "Director Cui of the Shanghai office, telegram received and understood. The war on the front lines is intensifying, and wounded soldiers are everywhere. It is urgent to find ways to rescue them. Please lead the Shanghai and Zhejiang teams to head north quickly and raise more medicines. Director Chen Zhen has already left for the south on the 7th. Please coordinate. Respectfully, Zhong Kouxi of the General Hospital in Ping."</p>

<p>After the eighth detachment of the medical team departed, the first brigade of the ninth team intensified training. The original plan was to head north for rescue on the 23rd of this month. However, due to the urgent telegram from the front, there is no time to delay. Therefore, it was decided that the entire team would head north around the 20th. It was also decided to take a group photo at the Xilin Zen Temple in Ximen at 4:00 PM today to commemorate the event and send letters to various agencies and organizations to invite them to visit.</p>

<p>The Shanghai office believes that with the departure of the 62 medical personnel of the first brigade of the ninth team imminent, there is a significant shortage of medicines, bandages, gauze, and other supplies, and it is hoped that all sectors will donate generously to facilitate rescue efforts. Yesterday, special letters were sent to the New Pharmaceutical Industry Association and other organizations, requesting enthusiastic donations to facilitate rescue efforts.</p>

<p>Yesterday, a reporter from the Dagong News Agency met with Chen Zhen, the director of the investigation department of the general hospital in Peiping, who came to Shanghai. Zhen said that there are rescue teams in the north, including the Red Cross Society, the Red Swastika Society, and sanatoriums. The Red Swastika Society is more financially affluent, with about 50 rescue vehicles, so the results are quite good. On the sanatorium side, there are one or two teams accompanying the army on the front lines, following the 32nd Army, Shang Zhen's unit, in the Luanzhou, Tangshan, and Kaiping areas. Three, four, and five teams are following the 26th Army, Xiao Zhichu's unit, in the Jixing and Sanyizhuangzilou areas. Six and seven teams are following the 17th Army, Xu Tingyao's unit, and Liu Kan's 83rd Division, in the Shixia and Miyun areas. At the same time, a large-scale wounded soldier reception center was jointly organized with the Peiping People's Self-Defense Council, the Capital Battlefield Rescue Team, and the China Sanatorium, located at Kangzhuang Station on the Jingui Railway, under the command of Sun Dianying's 41st Army. A large number of wounded soldiers are currently being accommodated. The sanatorium also established a sanatorium on Qianmen Xiangchang Road in Peiping, which currently accommodates about 1,000 wounded soldiers from various routes.</p>

Now, it is learned that Chairman Chiang telegraphed the refugees yesterday, expressing concern and donating 10,000 yuan for relief. After receiving the telegram, the representatives telegraphed their gratitude and also telegraphed Mayor Wu, requesting him to consult with President Wang to quickly seek fundamental solutions to comfort the refugees. In addition, a telegram was sent to President Sun, earnestly requesting relief. The respective telegrams are recorded below.</p>

<p>To Chairman Chiang in Nanchang: Your telegram is respectfully received. I am deeply grateful for your generosity and assistance of 10,000 yuan. However, the number of refugees is large, and this can only be a temporary measure. Fundamental relief urgently needs to be resolved, but the responsible authorities have not been able to do their utmost to maintain it. As a result, anti-Chinese sentiment in Mexico has persisted for two years without a solution. Overseas Chinese are being expelled, and there is no one to protect them. Our suffering is not worth mentioning, but it is a disgrace to foreign countries and has a major impact on the national image. Therefore, we urgently and earnestly request that you urge the government to quickly provide a fundamental solution to safeguard the national image and alleviate the plight of the overseas Chinese. We admire you, sir, as a leader of the party and the country, and we know you care for overseas Chinese. You will surely be able to reach out a hand and alleviate the shame of tens of thousands of refugees in Mexico and devise a plan for the aftermath. In addition to the funds being reported and praised, we, on behalf of all the refugees from Mexico, respectfully telegraph our gratitude.

<p>Walter Reports on Schmidt's Brief History</p>
<p>Li Jingcong Describes the Process of Jointly Establishing the Aviation Company</p>
<p>Schmidt, the Deputy Director and Chief of the Aviation Department of the Eurasia Aviation Corporation, died on April 29 in Germany during a long-distance test flight when the plane crashed and burned while flying over the Alps. Yesterday at 6:00 PM, the company held a special memorial service at the German Church at 1 Daxilu. Li Jingcong, the General Manager of the company, was sent by the Ministry of Transportation to attend as a representative. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e143">Venue Arrangement <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>A portrait of Mr. Schmidt was placed in the church, surrounded by many wreaths sent by various parties, including Tang Baoshu, Wen Hongen, Liu Hongsheng, Huang Naishu, Dai Enji, Huang Jiangquan, Xu Xueyu, Lin Wojiang, as well as the China Merchants Bureau, China National Aviation Corporation, the Directorate General of Posts, the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau, the Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Transportation, the Telegraph Bureau, and the Chinese Aviation Association.</p>
<h3 id="e144">Attendees <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>Those who attended the memorial service yesterday included Dai Enji, the General Manager of the China National Aviation Corporation, Huang Baoqing, the Chief of the Operations Division, Tang Baoshu of the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau, Guo Zengliang, Cha Zhenhu, Liao Guanxuan, and Sun Mutang of the Eurasia Aviation Corporation, as well as the German directors of the company, Poolsen, Walter, Fanliek, and Fakell, Fukuoka, the representative of the German Chamber of Commerce, more than a hundred German residents in Shanghai, and the German Consul General in Shanghai also personally attended.</p>
<h3 id="e145">Report on Brief History <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>After playing mourning music, the service began with a prayer by the pastor of the church, followed by Walter, the Acting Chief of the Aviation Department of the company, who reported on Mr. Schmidt's brief history, which was translated into Mandarin by Liao Guanxuan. He said, "Today, we are holding a memorial service for Schmidt, and we have many thoughts. We admire Schmidt's boldness and spirit in running the aviation business. When the European War broke out, Schmidt returned to Germany to fight the enemy and fulfill his aviation responsibilities. He lost a leg while participating in the war. After fitting an artificial leg, he believed that Germany wanted to gain a position in the world and must promote aviation. His views were: (1) to use aviation to make transportation convenient and bring nations closer together, and (2) to spread Germany's scientific reputation to various countries. Schmidt had made flights over the Caucasus Mountains. Several years ago, in order to establish one of the world's largest aviation routes, the Eurasia Aviation Corporation, he came to China as the Eastern representative of the German Hansa Airlines to negotiate a postal transport contract. This contract is a model contract for Sino-foreign joint ventures. Schmidt was not just a theorist but also a practitioner, unafraid of danger and hardship, and moving forward courageously. He died in a plane crash in Germany during a long-distance test flight, sacrificing himself for aviation. Now, we should not be sad. We must continue Schmidt's spirit and move forward with effort."</p>
<h3 id="e146">Mr. Li's Speech <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>Following this, Li Jingcong, the General Manager of Eurasia Aviation Corporation and representative of the Ministry of Transportation, delivered a speech, saying: "Today, in my capacity as a representative of the Ministry of Transportation and the General Manager of Eurasia Aviation Corporation, I am here to attend the memorial service for Mr. Schmidt. Not only do we mourn Mr. Schmidt's sacrifice for the Sino-German joint venture, Eurasia Aviation, but we also mourn the loss of a good advisor in this aviation construction process for China, a country that has always been known for its close ties with Germany. We are well aware that Eurasia Aviation Corporation was established based on the long-term, open, and transparent negotiations between the Chinese Ministry of Transportation and Hansa Airways, which was closely related to the German Ministry of Transportation and entrusted by Mr. Schmidt, resulting in the signing of the Eurasia Aviation Mail Transport Agreement. However, we know little, or not in detail, about Mr. Schmidt's special vision and great aspirations during the negotiation of this agreement. In addition to my grief and mourning, I would like to briefly recount it for you. When the Ministry of Transportation was negotiating the agreement with Mr. Schmidt, the Sino-American Aviation Mail Transport Agreement, negotiated between China and the American Aviation Development Company, had already been signed. Although the Sino-American agreement at that time was also a joint venture, society at the time believed that it was entirely monopolized by the Americans. Mr. Schmidt deeply understood that utilizing foreign capital and talent to jointly develop Chinese enterprises was indeed the policy of the late Premier, but in operating a joint venture with China, which was vastly different from what it was before the 20th century, in order to ensure its smooth progress and prevent damage, it was essential to adhere to the principle of complete responsibility and command by the Chinese, with foreigners providing assistance. Otherwise, with the passage of time, it would inevitably arouse suspicion among the Chinese that foreigners were overstepping their bounds, and it would be difficult to achieve lasting harmony and cooperation. Therefore, he not only did not envy the special rights obtained by the American side under the contract, nor did he demand equal sharing of benefits, but he also actively expressed his support for the principle advocated by the Chinese Ministry of Transportation that the Chinese should hold two-thirds of the profit rights and the Germans should hold one-third of the profit rights. In other words, the Chinese should bear direct command and supervision responsibilities, and the Germans should bear the obligation of providing assistance in the Sino-German joint venture Eurasia Aviation. He believed that this principle was in line with the times and reversed the long-standing view of Europeans and Americans that Sino-foreign joint ventures could not succeed unless foreigners were directly responsible for handling them. In the end, this view proved to be a fallacy. Observing that the Eurasia agreement was still in the process of being negotiated, while the Sino-American agreement signed at that time had already been overturned by the Chinese opposition and had to be revised based on the principles stipulated in the Eurasia agreement, and that Eurasia Aviation Corporation has been established for three years according to the provisions of that agreement, not only has there been no difficulty in its operation, but its business has also seen daily development. This shows that Mr. Schmidt's disregard for conventions and his rejection of public opinion truly demonstrated his special vision. Furthermore, when negotiating the Eurasia agreement, Mr. Schmidt firmly believed that only a contract that did not contain the nature of control or monopoly could serve as a tool for genuine cooperation. He also hoped that the establishment of this agreement could encourage closer cooperation between China and Germany, that German companies intending to operate joint ventures in China could use this agreement as a blueprint for further development, that Sino-German industry and commerce could become more prosperous after the opening of Eurasia Aviation, and that cultural exchanges between Europe and Asia could become closer due to the convenience of transportation. Mr. Schmidt also deeply believed that China was vast and its transportation was obstructed, and that the construction of railways and the dredging of rivers would be costly and time-consuming, making it difficult to address the urgent needs. He hoped that after the signing of the Eurasia agreement, in addition to actively promoting the route from Shanghai, via Nanjing, Beijing, and Manchuria, to Europe via Russia, he also hoped that, to the extent possible, the route from Shanghai, via the inland and remote provinces of Henan, Shaanxi, Gansu, and Xinjiang, and then via Russia to Europe, could also be promoted. Therefore, when the preparations for the Shanghai-Manchuria route were completed, he immediately proposed the establishment of a Northwest route to supplement the efforts of the Chinese government, pioneer the development of the interior's hidden resources, and relieve the suffering of the people in the interior. Mr. Schmidt's great aspirations can be seen from this. In order to realize his aspirations, Mr. Schmidt not only fulfilled his duties and made many proposals for the planning and preparation of Eurasia Aviation Corporation, but also personally conducted on-site surveys for each exploration flight, such as crossing the Hinggan Mountains and flying to Manchuria in the spring of the 20th year, flying across the Ruo Shui River and flying to Xinjiang in the winter of the same year, and the gradual trial flights to Shaanxi, Gansu, and Xinjiang from spring to winter last year. He never hesitated to endure hardship and personally face great dangers to obtain data for planning and preparation, making great contributions to China's aviation industry. The opening of China's Northwest route and its achievements today are all thanks to Mr. Schmidt. Even Mr. Schmidt's return to Germany this time was to prepare for the actual survey flight from Germany, leading a plane through Russia, and flying back to China to prepare for the official opening of Eurasia and realize his aspirations. Unfortunately, on April 29, he encountered danger and died in the line of duty while conducting a long-distance test flight in Germany, causing Eurasia Aviation Corporation to lose a pillar and China's aviation industry to lose a good assistant. In addition to our deep sorrow and mourning, we cannot help but admire Mr. Schmidt's special vision and great aspirations, and we hope that those of us who survive can continue to work hard based on his vision and aspirations to seek progress in all aspects between the two countries, so as to comfort Mr. Schmidt's spirit in heaven." Finally, a funeral march was played, and the meeting adjourned.</p>
<h3 id="e147">Interview with Various Parties Regarding the Concession Factory Inspection Case <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>Yu Hongjun said he will meet again soon</p>
<p>Bell said he is willing to negotiate at any time for a compromise</p>
<p>The consular body authorities deny that there is a compromise plan</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of factory inspections in the concessions, and the related matter of revising the bylaws of the Yangjingbang Regulations, its resolution is of great concern to Chinese and foreigners alike. After the consular body meeting the day before yesterday, it was rumored that a proper compromise had been reached. To clarify the truth for the public, a reporter from the New Voice News Agency specially visited the Secretary-General of the Municipal Government, Yu Hongjun, the Public Works Department and General Manager Bell, and the consular body authorities yesterday to inquire about the details. The details are recorded below.</p>
<h3 id="e148">Municipal Government Side <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>The True Situation Secretary-General of the Municipal Government, Yu Hongjun, reiterated the Municipal Government's attitude and the progress made in the current resolution during an interview with a reporter from the New Voice News Agency yesterday. Yu said that the Municipal Government's attitude on this matter has been stated repeatedly and is quite clear, that the Municipal Government believes that factory inspection is of utmost importance and an urgent matter. Therefore, it is willing to negotiate a proper solution with the Public Works Department without violating China's sovereignty. The matter is currently under discussion. Mr. Feetham sent a written opinion to the Municipal Government some time ago, but this written opinion has not yet been received. He will meet with Feetham for further discussion after receiving it soon. This is the most recent true situation. As for the fact that the consular body has postponed the approval of the Yangjingbang Regulations at the request of the Chinese government, he does not know whether our side has indeed made this request because he has not received a report from the central government.</p>
<h3 id="e149">Public Works Department Side <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>Expresses Dissatisfaction A reporter from the New Voice News Agency visited Mr. Bell, General Manager of the Public Works Department, at his office yesterday and first asked him about the compromise plan for resolving the factory inspection issue reported in the newspaper. Mr. Bell replied that he was unaware of this matter and did not believe it, as the matter is currently awaiting a decision from the consular body. He then expressed dissatisfaction with the various inaccurate reports published in the newspapers in recent days, saying that he did not know what the purpose of the various exaggerated reports published in the newspapers recently was. He asked if Western newspapers were like this, and said that he did not take them seriously because what they published was incomprehensible.</p>
<p>Has Not Received a Reply However, Mr. Bell tacitly acknowledged that the consular body and the consular body will have a recommendation for resolving the factory inspection case. It is said that the draft amendments to the Yangjingbang Regulations have been sent to the consular body and the consular body for approval, but no reply has been received yet. The matter is currently awaiting a decision from the consular body.</p>
<p>Pre-Negotiation for a Compromise The reporter then inquired about the negotiations. Mr. Bell stated that the Public Works Department is quite willing to conduct negotiations with both parties to seek an appropriate solution. The start of negotiations does not necessarily have to wait until the consular body's recommendation is received; both parties can discuss at any time. As for whether the meeting between Yu Hongjun and Feetham last Friday was a formal negotiation or a private contact, Mr. Bell replied that it could be said to be a contact that was half official and half private.</p>
<p>Implement Inspection The reporter finally inquired about the date when the Public Works Department will implement factory inspection and whether it will be within this year. Mr. Bell replied that there is no doubt that this case will be implemented within this year, and the starting date is also quite near. Mr. Bell's statement seemed to be a casual reply in haste, as in fact, it is extremely difficult to implement without the consular body and the consular body approving the bylaws of the Yangjingbang Regulations, reaching an agreement on a solution with our side, and the Public Works Department itself having sufficient preparation for this matter. The so-called "starting date is quite near" is, in fact, impossible to achieve.</p>
<h3 id="e150">Consular Body Side <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>Denies Compromise Before visiting the General Manager of the Public Works Department yesterday, the reporter first visited the consular body authorities. Because the spokesperson refused to reveal their name, they only allowed the publication of official news. The spokesperson said that the consular body's meeting the day before yesterday only had a slight discussion on this issue and did not make any decisions regarding this matter. As for the reports that the meeting the day before yesterday decided that the Public Works Department would set up an inspection office and employ experienced Chinese people as inspectors, they are absolutely untrue. The meeting that day was a regular meeting, mainly to discuss other issues. In addition, the spokesperson said that the consular body has a recommendation on this matter, and the bylaws of the Yangjingbang Regulations, which have been approved by the consular body, have been sent to the consular body for consideration. No reply has been received yet, and there is no other compromise plan. As for the content of the recommendation, they refused to disclose it.</p>
<h3 id="e151">The Ministry of Industry's Statement <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>The New Voice News Agency's reporter stationed in Beijing visited the relevant authorities of the Ministry of Industry yesterday to inquire about the progress of the negotiations on the issue of factory inspection in the public concession. The authorities gave a detailed reply as follows:</p>
<p>Three Principles Decided Long Ago Since the national government announced the Factory Inspection Law in the 20th year, the Ministry of Industry has been preparing to gradually implement the measures. Regarding factory inspection in Shanghai, the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs, the concession authorities, and international labor commissioners held three meetings at the end of the 20th year and decided on three principles: (1) The public concession and French concession authorities are willing to accept factory inspectors trained and recommended by the Chinese government to inspect factories in the concession. The aforementioned factory inspectors are supervised by central inspection personnel at any time. (2) Inspectors in the concession should report inspection results and difficulties to the Chinese government and the concession authorities on time. (3) All factory inspectors in the public concession and French concession of the municipal government should meet once a month to exchange opinions and jointly plan improvements. After these principles were decided, they were suddenly suspended because the Japanese consul submitted a request to the Shanghai Municipal Government to ban anti-Japanese movements. The sudden amendment of Article 34 of the bylaws of the Yangjingbang Land Regulations by the Western taxpayers' association, attempting to seize the right to inspect factories in the concession, not only infringed on China's sovereignty, but also contradicted the results of previous consultations. It seems that the concession authorities' move was rather abrupt.</p>
<p>The Public Works Department Has Understood After the Shanghai Municipal Government protested to the consuls, the concession authorities have shown considerable tolerance for the declaration of China's sovereignty. The Secretary-General of the Municipal Government, Yu Hongjun, is responsible for negotiating with Feetham, the General Manager of the Public Works Department, and has presented the memorandum from the previous meeting for negotiation. Bao Guohua, a section chief of the Labor Division dispatched by the Ministry of Industry to Shanghai, only provided detailed opinions for the Municipal Government's preliminary negotiations. According to Bao's conversation with the New Voice News Agency's reporter stationed in Beijing after returning to Beijing, the Municipal Government and the Public Works Department are currently negotiating the principles for implementing factory inspection. This is currently in progress, so the content of the negotiations cannot be released. However, it can be said that the concession authorities are no longer as insistent on Article 34 of the bylaws of the Yangjingbang Regulations as before and are preparing to implement it. The concession authorities are also very clear about the sovereignty that the Chinese government is fighting for, so the future is quite promising.</p>
<p>Foreign Factories Still Need to Be Negotiated As for factory inspection in Shanghai, the preliminary inspection and investigation work in the Chinese-controlled areas has been completed. The Public Works Department has no objections to the inspection of Chinese-owned factories in the concession. However, the inspection of foreign factories in the concession is still a target for negotiation. The Ministry of Industry will never discriminate against domestic and foreign factories. Due to the importance of factory inspection, it is especially necessary to implement inspection. In the future, after the Shanghai Municipal Government and the concession authorities have negotiated to a considerable extent, the Ministry of Industry will also send representatives to attend the official consultation on the implementation of inspection measures.</p>
<p>Establish a Central Inspection Office The Ministry of Industry is also preparing to establish a Central Factory Inspection Office. However, the progress of the Shanghai Municipal Government's factory inspection does not have to wait until the Central Factory Inspection Office is established, because the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs has already established an inspection section and all equipment can be implemented at any time.</p>
<p>Beijing and Shanghai Authorities Discuss in Detail Our side will form a joint committee to jointly preside over the inspection matters of the Shanghai concession factory inspection rights. Mayor Wu and Luo Shi and Chen, etc. are discussing in detail.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Times reported that Admiral Dreyer, commander-in-chief of the British Navy in China, visited Shanghai for the first time since taking office. He sailed to the Yangtze River on the flagship HMS Kent at 8:30 a.m. yesterday (the 16th).

<p>Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce Chairman Wang Xiaolai, supervisors Du Yuesheng, Wang Yansong, Chen Songyuan, etc., jointly invited leaders of various industry associations to a gathering at the Chamber of Commerce last night. More than a hundred people, including Lao Jingxiu and Chen Liangyu, attended. Chairman Wang Xiaolai said that the monthly donations initiated by various industries were originally scheduled for a period of six months. Now, the situation in the Northeast is more urgent than before. The soldiers at the front are fighting bloody battles, and the people in the rear should work hard to transport supplies. Therefore, he hopes that after the expiration of the term, donations will continue to be collected in order to be sent to the front line to provide assistance. Everyone agreed.</p>
<h3 id="e155">Fujian Province Strictly Prevents the Import of Inferior Rice <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>Thai Rice Must Be Certified by the Chamber of Commerce</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce received a letter from the Minhou County Rice Milling Industry Guild yesterday, stating that it was based on Instruction No. 2227 of the Provincial Government. According to the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce's letter and telegram, the Thai rice and white rice loaded on the Tai Lun on March 15 were all purchased in Shanghai and were entirely domestic products. After the chamber of commerce verified, the Soy and Rice Industry Guild had certified the rice when it was declared for loading. After the Jianghai Customs inspected and released it, the Fuzhou Public Security Bureau did not distinguish it and detained the batch of Soviet rice, claiming it was cargo of the enemy workers. The certification procedures for this batch of transported Soviet rice have been completed. Please order the Public Security Bureau to release all the detained batches of Soviet rice together to help the people eat, etc. Based on this, the order instructed the relevant departments to quickly investigate and reply for review and handling without delay. This order, etc. For this reason, when the various community groups in Fuzhou spontaneously organized the National Salvation Association, this chamber of commerce reported to the Provincial Public Security Bureau for instructions because Soviet rice was similar to goods from the enemy and food for the people was also relevant. The proof method should be proposed by this chamber of commerce for each batch of transported Soviet rice. After discussion, it was decided that the transported Soviet rice must be certified by the declared legal authorities and inspected by the Jianghai Customs for release, etc., and reported to the provincial government for review. Correspondingly, please note that in the future, Soviet rice transported to Fujian only needs your chamber of commerce to issue a certificate, and then the inspection and release by the Jianghai Customs can complete the procedures. There is no need to repeatedly send telegrams for certification, causing misunderstandings, etc. It is heard that the Municipal Chamber of Commerce has sent letters to the local soy and rice industry and other guilds for reference.</p>

<p>Only Active Resistance by China Can Lead to a Way Out</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the General Labor Union, and the Municipal Board of Education invited Mr. William Martin, the former editor of the Geneva News, to speak on the Sino-Japanese conflict at the auditorium of the Chamber of Commerce at 5 p.m. yesterday. Wang Xiaolai, Shen Junru, Zhu Xuefan, Zheng Chengqing, Zhou Feicheng, Chen Zongcheng, and representatives of various labor unions, totaling more than 300 people, attended. Chairman Wang Xiaolai delivered a speech, briefly stating that Mr. Martin is a Swiss and has served as the editor of the Geneva News for more than ten years. He is quite knowledgeable about international issues. He is extremely fair on the Sino-Japanese issue and is here this time to uphold justice and publicize Japanese atrocities, so we express our great welcome. Mr. Martin then delivered a speech, translated by Chen Zongcheng. The essence of the speech is as follows: The Sino-Japanese conflict has been going on for a long time, and you have personally experienced it, so you should be clearer than I am. However, everyone's viewpoints are different, so opinions vary accordingly. I would like to offer my personal observations. Japan's seizure of Dong Province not only harms China, but also undermines world peace. However, to resolve this dispute, the League of Nations cannot exercise its full power due to various constraints, and can only provide considerable assistance to China spiritually or economically. The only solution is for China to rise up and actively resist. Only then can there be a way out.</p>
<h3 id="e160">Father Sues Son for Unfilial Conduct, Appealing the Case <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>| The Judge Intended to Reconcile |</p>
<p>Wu Shaoqin of Datuan, Pudong, previously sued his biological son, Wu Daonan, in the Nanhui County Government for unfilial and violent conduct, stabbing his right arm with a knife, nearly resulting in an accident. The County Government verified the injury marks, and as a result, Wu Daonan was declared not guilty. Wu Shaoqin refused to accept the judgment and hired lawyers Yao Yuanding and Wang Fushang to file an appeal with the Shanghai District Court. The case was heard yesterday morning in the First Tribunal by Judge Guan Liting. The appellant, Wu Shaoqin, arrived in court with lawyer Wang, while Wu Daonan arrived with lawyer Pan Cheng'e, whom he had hired to defend him. Wu Shaoqin first stated that he was 44 years old, from Nanhui, and lived in Datuan Town. He was practicing medicine in the French Concession of Shanghai. The judge asked why he did not accept the judgment of Nanhui County. He replied that Wu Daonan was his biological son, born to his first wife, Jiang. Because Jiang had an affair with a man named Chen from Yangsiqiao, Daonan, under the instigation of his mother, attempted to murder him. The judge asked if he and Jiang lived in separate places. He replied that yes, he worked in Shanghai, so he lived in Shanghai with his later wife, Xiao, while Jiang lived at home in Datuan, Pudong. The judge asked when he married Xiao. He replied that he married her in the fourth year of the Republic of China. Because he returned home less often, Jiang took the opportunity to move to her mother's home in Lujiahui in the tenth year of the Republic of China. Jiang Yansheng was his father-in-law. Soon after, Jiang moved to Yangsiqiao and had an affair with Chen, who was very influential in the area. The judge asked if he sent money home. He replied that yes, and there was also rent to be collected at home. He had sued Jiang for cohabitation and had accused her of adultery in the court. On September 16 of last year, he returned home because his mother was ill. In the afternoon, in the evening, he was stabbed in the right arm by Daonan with a knife while sitting on a rattan chair in the厢房. He chased after Daonan and caught him. His mother died on the 21st of that month. The judge asked if there was any evidence. He replied that there was bloody clothing and the murder weapon. The judge then ordered Wu Daonan to the case. Daonan stated that he was 22 years old, lived in Yangsiqiao, and was in the flower factory business. Wu Shaoqin was his father. The judge asked why he murdered his father. He replied that he had not. On September 14 of last year, a relative named Tao said that his grandmother was ill. On the afternoon of the 15th, at 4 or 5 o'clock, he took advantage of the small break to go home. Because his father and mother had previously been involved in a lawsuit, he lived with his mother in Yangsiqiao, so his father was very dissatisfied with him. He saw his father when he returned home. He called him "Daddy," but his father did not respond and instead hit him. He then went to Tao's house to spend the night. On the 16th, he was arrested at the wheel port and taken to the bureau. The judge obtained the confession and said to Wu Shaoqin that you two do not need to litigate. Wu replied that he requested justice. The judge then said to Wu Daonan that you should apologize to your father. This case must be reconciled. As a result, the judge ordered a hearing to be scheduled at a later date.</p>

<p>Last night, when it was raining heavily and there was thunder and lightning, the power line on the corner of the house of the Hu Maosheng Tea Shop at the intersection of Dongjiadu Lane Road in Nanshi was suddenly broken by lightning. The yellow copper wire was suspended on the side of the road. Those who knew it warned each other not to move it. At that time, it was midnight, and there was no time to repair it. Who knew that at dawn, an old woman from Jiangbei who looked like a ragpicker saw the red copper wire abandoned on the side of the road and could not help but have greedy thoughts. She stepped forward to pick it up. At that time, although passers-by were eager to stop her, it was too late. In an instant, her face turned black and she died on the side of the road. The situation was extremely tragic.</p>

<h3 id="e167">Refusing to Store Enemy Goods: Fresh Fish <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>Jiang Azhen Attempts Deception</p>
<p>Tu Wenzhao Righteously Refuses</p>
<p>Fresh fish, chicken, duck, and other such items must be sold on the same day. If stored for too long, the color and taste will change, and no one will buy them. Since the advent of refrigerated storage, fresh goods can be stored for one to two years without changing taste. Therefore, major restaurants and fresh goods stores must store large quantities of fresh goods every year to prevent shortages between seasons. Thus, refrigeration companies are an important part of the food market. Hongchang Refrigeration Company, located at 557 Miller Road, Hongkou, Shanghai, was established not long ago and has already gained a great reputation. On the 5th of this month, a person claiming to be Jiang Azhen brought a large quantity of fresh fish, requesting that the company refrigerate it. Little did they know that the fish were entirely enemy goods. The handler did not pay attention and was deceived into storing them. Tu Wenzhao, the manager of the company, is sharp and meticulous. Noticing that Jiang Azhen's attitude was unusual, he became suspicious. After investigating, he learned that all the goods were enemy goods. Manager Tu, filled with righteous indignation, immediately refused to store them and ordered Jiang to remove them immediately. Knowing that he could not continue the deception, Jiang loaded the fish and left. It is unknown what will happen to this large quantity of fresh enemy fish at the beginning of this hot season.</p>

<p>| Please Cease Trading with Japanese Merchants Immediately |</p>
<p>The Clock and Watch Trade Association has recently discovered that Hengxingxiang Clock and Watch Store (at the intersection of Avenue Edward VII and Rue du Consulat), a fellow business, has been purchasing large quantities of enemy clocks from Yoshida &amp; Co., a Japanese merchant on Sijing Road, and selling them at reduced prices, greatly affecting the sales of domestically produced table clocks. Therefore, it was proposed at the 46th Executive Committee Standing Committee meeting to send a letter to the store owner, Li Zhixiang, warning him to cease trading with Japanese merchants immediately and to seal up the enemy goods for disposal. We have obtained the original letter, which is transcribed below: Sir, According to confidential reports, your company specializes in selling inferior goods at reduced prices, and we request that the association stop this. Therefore, this matter was submitted to the 46th meeting of the Executive Committee for discussion and resolution. We hereby request Hengxingxiang to cease trading with Japanese merchants immediately and to report the stock to the association for clearance within three days to avoid causing misunderstandings from the outside world.

<p>Luo Songshan, Utterly Desperate</p>
<h3 id="e169">Forging Champagne Tickets <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>Accomplice Qian Qingshan is 68 Years Old</p>
<p>Printed by Lu Quansheng's Printing House</p>
<p>Luo Songshan, a 34-year-old man from Zhenjiang, has recently been utterly desperate. Taking advantage of the spring horse racing season, he forged small champagne tickets and, on the 1st of this month, went to Wang Yunfang, his fellow townsman, at 88 North Suzhou Road to sell seven tickets for one yuan each, which he then spent. Luo thought that Wang did not recognize the genuine tickets, so he went to deceive him again on the 8th. However, Wang Yunfang had already found out. Just as he was about to negotiate with him, Luo walked right into the trap. Wang pretended to agree and secretly sent someone to report to the nearby No. 1073 Chinese constabulary. The constables arrested Luo and, upon searching him, Chinese detective Yang Zhaoqing found ten forged small champagne tickets and twenty-six yuan in cash. After questioning, it was learned that his accomplice was Qian Qingshan from Ningbo, 68 years old, who was hiding at 606 Tiantong Road. The detectives went and arrested Qian. They found five forged large champagne tickets worth ten yuan each in his room. It was learned that these forged tickets were manufactured by Lu Quansheng's printing house at 30 Beijing Road. They went to arrest Lu, but he had already fled after hearing the news. They confiscated a printing press and brought Qian Qingshan to the police station. The next morning, they were escorted to the summary court of the First Special District Court for questioning. The judge ordered them to be transferred to the local court for trial at a later date. This has already been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Wu Zehan continued the hearing at the Third Criminal Court. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin presented the case, stating that this case was within the extended period. According to the defendant Luo Songshan, his friend Tang Jialin, who is on the run, sold as many as 90 of these forged champagne tickets. However, these forged tickets were all bought from Qian Qingshan, a total of one hundred tickets, purchased in two installments. The first time was on April 12th, when he bought fifty tickets, and the second time was on the 20th, when he bought another fifty tickets, paying one yuan and five jiao each time. The five forged large champagne tickets found in Qian Qingshan's possession were sent to the Shanghai Race Club, and Western staff member Litte examined them and found that they were indistinguishable from the real tickets, except for one different word in the Western text. According to Qian Qingshan, he had printed a total of one thousand of these small champagne tickets at Lu Quansheng's printing house on Beijing Road. He received them a month ago and distributed them with a Chen surname fugitive to Nanjing, Hangzhou, and other places. The number of people who were fooled by them is countless. The police station is now prosecuting them for fraud and obtaining property under Article 363 of the Criminal Law and for forging documents under Article 226. The forged champagne tickets and cash were presented for inspection. It was requested that they be severely prosecuted. When questioned, both defendants evaded the issue. Judge Wu ordered them to be remanded in custody for sentencing at a later date.</p>
<p>Gu Akun</p>
<h3 id="e170">Using a Cleaver to Kill His Own Daughter <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>And Kill His Niece Yang Acui</p>
<p>Heads Bleeding, Fortunately Not Dead</p>
<p>Gu Akun, a local, is 53 years old and works as a vendor. He lives at 199 Xundao Street, Dadongmen, Nanshi. However, Gu is addicted to opium and also likes to drink, so he often feels poor. Gu has a daughter named Jinfeng, who is 21 years old. Her mother died early, and she was raised by her father. She works as a yarn winder in a diligent sock factory in Huotui Lane, earning wages every month to supplement the family income. A few days ago, Gu took Jinfeng to the home of his brother-in-law, Mr. Yang, in Yangjia Town, Pudong, for several days. Gu returned home first, and Jinfeng, together with her cousin Yang Acui (20 years old), crossed the river to Nanshi at around 9:00 AM yesterday. Because Acui had been feeling abdominal pain recently, fearing that she had a disease, she went to see a doctor with Jinfeng for treatment. They returned home, and it was noon, so they had lunch together. At that time, Gu ordered Jinfeng to go to the street to buy wine for him, but Jinfeng refused. Gu became very angry and scolded her. Then, he angrily took a pot and went out to buy wine himself. After the meal, Jinfeng and Acui went to Xiaodongmen to buy patterns and then returned home. Gu had already drunk a lot of sorghum wine, his face red, his breath reeking of alcohol. Acui, because it was already past 3:00 PM, feared that her family would be waiting for her, so she bid farewell to her uncle (Gu Akun). Gu replied that it was still early, play for a while longer, don't worry, your uncle won't eat you. So, although Acui bid farewell repeatedly, she was not allowed to leave, so she sat on the bed and chatted with Jinfeng. Unexpectedly, not long after, Gu suddenly came from the kitchen, holding a cleaver, rushed into the room, tightly closed the door, and then raised the knife and first struck Jinfeng's head twice, and then struck Acui's head once. Both of them suffered serious head injuries. In an instant, blood flowed freely. They rushed out of the room, screaming for help. Wang Xingyi, the patrol officer in the area, heard the screams and rushed over. He saw that Jinfeng and Acui were both covered in blood, and Gu's head was also slightly injured, with blood flowing. He took all three of them to Shanghai Hospital for treatment, and then took them to the First Section of the First District, where Director Jin preliminarily questioned them. First, Yang Acui testified that she was inexplicably murdered by her uncle. Gu Jinfeng testified that she worked in a sock factory, and because her father's monthly income was very small, not enough for him to smoke, drink, and pay for all the household expenses, he often scolded and beat her. At lunch today, her father ordered her to go out and buy wine, and because the wine she usually bought for him was always called "fire wine" and not genuine sorghum, he often scolded her. Therefore, she did not agree to buy wine for her father today, and he held a grudge. Later, she and her cousin Acui returned from Xiaodongmen, and he used a knife to murder them. As for the minor injury to his head, he used the knife to cut himself. Gu Akun testified that Wang Gengsheng lived in the back building of his house. He used to work in a rubber shoe factory. Last year, he suddenly became intimate with his daughter Jinfeng. Because family scandals should not be spread, he endured it. Later, because Jinfeng was passionate about her affair, she asked to bring Wang home, but he firmly refused. Jinfeng regarded him as a thorn in her side and repeatedly discussed wanting to murder him. Today, Jinfeng gathered many people and used a cleaver to injure his head. He requested a thorough investigation. The director questioned him that Acui had no grievances or hatred with him, so how did she suffer such a serious head injury? Gu was speechless. Because he was drunk, he used a knife to injure his own daughter and niece, but still wanted to find excuses to blame others. He was ordered to prepare a document to be sent to the bureau for interrogation.</p>

The bureau immediately dispatched personnel, together with Chinese and Western detectives from the patrol, to arrest sixteen Communist men and women at a certain place in the British Concession, and seized more than a dozen boxes of various reactionary publications, which were brought to the bureau for interrogation by the Third Section. The interrogation has been completed. Except for six people who were found innocent and released, the remaining ten people, including Li Tianming, Zhu Zhijiang, Lin Shuren, Li Zhiqi, Chen Zijian, Hu Qi, Zhang Xinhua, Su Yanqiu, Luo Yizi, and Fang Qingjian, were escorted by officials on the Beijing-Shanghai night express train the night before and sent to the Nanjing Garrison Headquarters for interrogation.</p>
<h3 id="e172">Inspection of Cured Ham <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>Executive Yuan Order Stresses Simplicity</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau's inspection of cured ham has aroused opposition from the industry, and they have petitioned the Executive Yuan to stop it. According to the Executive Yuan's reply, in order to alleviate business difficulties, the inspection fee will be reduced. Later, due to the Municipal Health Bureau's detention of goods, the industry association and the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce again petitioned the Executive Yuan. The Executive Yuan ordered the Municipal Government to strive for simplicity in the inspection procedures, in line with the purpose of inspection being to protect businesses. In addition to replying to the Executive Yuan, the Municipal Government also ordered the Municipal Health Bureau to comply. The original order of the Executive Yuan is transcribed below: Order for implementation. According to the report of the Ministry of Industry, the Shanghai Cured Ham Industry Association has petitioned to stop the Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau's inspection of cured ham, and it has been approved that the inspection fee should be reduced to show consideration. In addition to ordering the Shanghai Municipal Government to comply, the Ministry should be notified. I have received this. I secretly investigated that this case had previously been repeatedly petitioned by the industry association to cancel the inspection in order to alleviate business difficulties. Following the order, it should be temporarily allowed to be handled. It was originally expected that this case could be temporarily concluded, and a fundamental solution would be made when the internal sales inspection method was drafted. Later, due to the Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau's detention of goods and refusal to release them, the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce and the industry association successively petitioned, detailing excessive fees, detention and harassment, and various other reasons, requesting that it be stopped in accordance with the law. While the matter was being carefully reviewed, it was ordered that the fee rate had been reduced, which showed the Executive Yuan's consideration of business difficulties. However, the original report mentioned more than just excessive fees. According to the order No. 23 of the National Government Jingzi of October last year, based on the original proposal of the Legislative Yuan, although the Ministry can formulate inspection methods for domestic goods separately, it also included the words "still must be based on not harming businesses or disturbing the people." The inspection of goods is originally to guarantee the quality of goods, thereby increasing credit and maintaining sales. Not only should the inspection fee be reduced as much as possible, but the inspection procedures should also be as simple as possible, in line with the purpose of inspection being to protect businesses. Now that the fee rate has been reduced, it seems necessary to strive for speed and convenience for businesses and the people in the inspection procedures. I hereby submit a document to request approval and order the Shanghai Municipal Government to transfer the order to the Health Bureau to strive for simplicity in the inspection procedures, paying special attention to it to show consideration. In addition to the instructions, the order is hereby given to the Municipal Government to immediately transfer the order to the Health Bureau to strive for simplicity in the inspection procedures to alleviate business difficulties. This order.</p>

<p>Cao Ajian, a carpenter, was lured to the vicinity of the Siming Guild Hall in Pudong at around 7:00 PM on April 15th last year by Zhou Axiang, Zhou Jinshan, Wang Qiugen, and others, and was axed to death. The case was discovered two weeks later, and the perpetrators had fled without a trace. Only the suspect Wang Qiugen was arrested. After repeated investigations and clear confirmation by the Criminal Court of the District Court, it was proven that Zhou Axiang initiated the crime together with his younger brother Zhou Jinshan and Wang Qiugen. The debate was considered concluded, awaiting sentencing. The details have been reported in the previous newspaper. It is now known that the case was sentenced yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM by Judge Luo Renji, who ordered Wang Qiugen to be brought to the case and questioned briefly before announcing the sentence in court. Wang Qiugen was sentenced to life imprisonment for the crime of murder. After the sentence was announced, he was ordered to be returned to custody, awaiting the expiration of the appeal period before being sent to prison.</p>

<p>International Trade Bureau Collects Tea Samples</p>
<p>Ji Zejin, Director and Secretary of the Guidance Office of the International Trade Bureau of the Ministry of Industry, said yesterday that the quantity of Chinese tea sold to Russia has been greatly reduced to 3 million taels last year due to the influence of Indian and Japanese tea. Tea merchants have requested assistance from both the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry. Now, efforts are being made to negotiate with both the silver and money industries. Russia's import and export goods are all state-owned. For the tea trade with China, India, and Japan, a specialist has been sent to handle it. The specialist in China is Mr. Bekoff. He is now in Shanghai. At the time when new tea is on the market, the specialist has begun to investigate the selling price and supply and demand situation of tea in Shanghai, and whether Chinese tea can be sold on credit until December before payment. He plans to draft a detailed budget and report it to the Moscow Russian government within two weeks, and then decide on the purchase quantity. If we cannot sell tea to Russia on credit at the time of this tea decline, the amount of tea sold to Russia will probably be greatly reduced again. Ji also told reporters that the bureau previously convened a meeting of tea merchants to discuss relief measures, and decided on one item, which was to collect various samples of tea produced in China and send them to our consulates in major cities of various countries for exhibition and publicity, so as to implement direct trade between tea merchants and tea-buying countries. The bureau has now collected dozens of types and will soon be able to complete them and send them to various countries. (Daily News)</p>

<p>The Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau originally had a health district office in Wusong. Due to the January 28th Incident, the office was located in a war zone, so all work was completely destroyed. Since Li Ting'an took over as Director of the Municipal Health Bureau in January last year, in view of the importance of this cause to the interests of the local people, he has made every effort to restore it. The original Haibin Hospital in Wusong, which was run by local charities, was also completely destroyed during the war and unable to be restored. Therefore, Director Li sent personnel to consult with the Wusong Jide Hall to rent the site of the Haibin Hospital at a very low rental price to build the Wusong District Health Office, in order to promote health care, treatment, disease prevention, maternity protection, and health education. On the one hand, Director Li planned the funding and requested that the Post-War Rehabilitation Committee decide to subsidize 32,000 yuan. The Ministry of Health of the Ministry of Interior allocated 5,073 yuan, 1 jiao, and 6 fen. The National Tongji University proposed cooperation to facilitate internships for the Department of Public Health of the university. After both parties negotiated, they have actively started construction. Bids for the construction of the office building will begin immediately, and it is expected to be completed within a few months. This is good news for the health prospects of the local citizens.</p>
<h3 id="e181">Records of Puyi Villa's Charitable Deeds <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>Shanghai Puyi Villa has been providing charitable services such as burying the exposed and providing medical treatment and medicine in hospitals for many years, all of which require funds. Fortunately, benefactors from all walks of life have made every effort to support it, so that it can be maintained to this day. However, in recent years, the area has expanded and the population has become denser, and the expenses for burial work and all materials have increased a hundredfold compared to before, and the items such as hospital medicines have also increased day by day. Funding is short, and there is a real danger of not being able to make ends meet. We can only appeal to all benefactors and gentlemen to think about the fact that burying the exposed and providing medical treatment and medicine are closely related to local health. If all sectors can enthusiastically help and provide a steady stream of supplies, so that the villa can work hard and make great contributions, the merits will be immeasurable. It is also heard that the members of the Leshan Society of the villa plan to perform a play to raise funds for a small subsidy.</p>

<p>▲ Post-War European Economic History</p>
<p>The Commercial Press has recently published "Post-War European Economic History," originally titled "A History of Recent European Economic Development," written by Professor Ogg of the University of Wisconsin, USA. In 1924, it was translated by Li Guangzhong and entrusted to the Press for publication, and it was quite popular at the time. However, Li's translation was based on the 1916 edition, and the materials covered only went up to 1914. The wartime and post-war situations were not described. Therefore, Dr. Schap, in 1926, compiled six chapters systematically on the economic situation in Europe during the ten years after the war, such as population, land, food, agriculture, industry, commerce, shipping, labor, and finance, and appended them to the original book as a supplement. The edition now published by the Press is the translation of this supplement. The book is rich in information and detailed in its descriptions and is undoubtedly a famous work on modern economics. Although the materials in it do not include the most recent years' economic situation, many of today's world economic events are rooted in the impact of the Great War. Therefore, studying this book will make it easier to understand the causes and consequences of recent economic changes. Moreover, our country's economy is backward, and everything needs to be rebuilt. This book can especially serve as a reference. The book is translated by Lin Guangcheng, the writing style is clear and fluent, and the printing and binding are also excellent.</p>

<p>Speech at the YMCA on May 10th</p>
<p>Gentlemen, I believe everyone has an urgent question in their minds today that needs answering. That is: will Japan continue its aggression, or will it be satisfied with just seizing the three northeastern provinces and Jehol? You may recall that when Shenyang fell during the "September 18th Incident," some complacent and short-sighted people believed that the problem would not escalate. Later, when northern Manchuria and Jinzhou were lost, these complacent and short-sighted people again thought that Japan would be satisfied with just seizing the three northeastern provinces and that it would not escalate further. Then, when Shanhaiguan was lost, these complacent and short-sighted people again believed that Japan had seized Shanhaiguan and could ensure the security of the "Manchukuo puppet state" and would be satisfied with that, without escalating further. But then Jehol was lost. These complacent and short-sighted people again thought that Japan had seized Jehol and completed the natural terrain of the "Manchukuo puppet state" and would certainly not escalate further, and certainly not expand within the Great Wall. But now, most of Chahar has already been lost, and eastern Luanda has also been lost. These complacent and short-sighted people are still dreaming, thinking that Japan will never attack Tianjin and Peiping.</p>
<p>Since the "September 18th Incident," I have not dared to dream. I am even less willing to bury my head in the sand, pretending not to see the danger, like an ostrich. I believe that Japan will continue its aggression without end. There are three reasons for this: (1) Territorial connection. Japan has seized the three northeastern provinces and Jehol and will inevitably advance southward, like the westward expansion movement of the United States, which did not stop until it spanned the entire continent to the Pacific coast. Japan will eventually sweep across our entire country. This is Tanaka's policy, and it is also a natural trend. In the eyes of the Japanese, it will be realized sooner or later. (2) Ensuring the security of the acquired land. Japan will inevitably take offense as the best form of defense. After gaining the Northeast, it will invade North China to use North China as a buffer zone. After gaining North China, it will invade the Yangtze River basin to use the Yangtze River basin as a buffer zone. After gaining the Yangtze River basin, it will invade South China. Only after conquering our entire country will Japan be satisfied and sleep soundly. (3) Although a world war will not happen immediately, it will be difficult to avoid in the future. Japan knows that it is the culprit in the Far East and cannot help but actively prepare. Since the country is small and poor in resources, it must use China as its base for militaristic expansion.</p>
<p>Will Japan's continuous aggression policy succeed? It depends on three aspects: (1) Whether the international community will actively intervene in Japan's actions. Everyone knows that this is a period of global economic crisis. The United Kingdom and the United States are busy reorganizing internally. Since Hitler came to power in Germany, the atmosphere in Europe has been unusually tense. Furthermore, the people of various countries have not been far removed from the European war, and everyone is unwilling to have a second world war occur immediately. As for Soviet Russia, firstly because the national foundation is not strong, and secondly because the five-year plan has not been completed, it not only cannot support weak nations, but recently it has colluded with our enemies, despised our national sovereignty, and sold the China Eastern Railway to the "Manchukuo puppet state." Therefore, in the current international situation, the international community will not actively intervene in Japan's actions. Japan can continue its aggression without fear. (2) Whether internal strife or revolution will occur within Japan. If internal strife or revolution occurs, it can restrain Japan's aggressive behavior. In the eyes of complacent and enslaved Chinese people, this is something they pray for day and night. But with Japan's China policy going smoothly and unstoppable, the general Japanese public is overjoyed and celebrating. Where would there be any revolution? Only when China encounters strong resistance, fails militarily, the scope of the war expands, and the burden on the people increases, will the people turn from dissatisfaction and disappointment to revolution, like Germany in the European war. If France was the China of today, and simply did not resist, then the German Empire would not only not have had a revolution, but its foundation would be even more solid. (3) Whether China resists or not. We all know that even if there is resistance, it is only local resistance, stemming from the patriotic zeal of local military officers. But the more China does not resist, the more Japan advances. The more Japan advances, the more China does not resist. As a result, in a year and a half, carelessly, half of the country will be lost. Conversely, if we had desperately resisted from the beginning, Japan's aggressive policy would not have been so smooth, and it would not have been so rapid. The reason it continues to be so rapid is precisely because we continue to retreat so rapidly.</p>
<p>But the government still says that it is a long-term resistance. For example, not long ago, Premier Wang Jingwei specifically issued a very long telegram to explain the issue of war and peace, saying, "Because we cannot fight, we resist. Because we cannot make peace, we negotiate. Therefore, resistance and negotiation proceed simultaneously." But we must ask, is what is called war military conflict? If we use military force to resist, is that war? Wasn't the resistance of the 19th Route Army in Shanghai war? Wasn't the resistance of Song Zheyuan's army at Xifengkou war? Wasn't the resistance of Xu Tingyao's army at Gubeikou war? If what Mr. Wang calls resistance is not military resistance, but resistance that dares not fight, then what is the difference between this and Mr. Zhang Xueliang's non-resistance policy? As for "Because we cannot make peace, we negotiate," we understand even less why we should negotiate with Japan, knowing that we cannot make peace. Does negotiation mean hoping for peace? The result of the government's "two-faced policy" (resisting on one hand and negotiating on the other) is that not only is the government indecisive, unable to grasp the direction, and without a plan, but even we ordinary people do not know what to do.</p>

<h3 id="e193">On "Integrity" <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>Walking past the foreign barracks on ××× Road, I encountered this incident. A short, fat officer came out, and five or six rickshaws across the street rushed towards him all at once. The swift-footed got there first, and two rickshaws had already stopped at his feet. Perhaps because he saw that the cushion of the second rickshaw was a bit whiter, the short, fat man retracted his right foot, which had already stepped onto the first rickshaw, and jumped onto the second. The first rickshaw puller seemed unwilling to give up, grabbing the handlebar of the second rickshaw. The result: he was kicked by the short, fat man.</p>
<p>Two gentlemen in brand-new "spring attire" walking in front of me began to comment.</p>
<p>"Really asking for trouble!" one said.</p>
<p>"These rickshaw pullers always rush to pull foreigners, they deserve to be beaten. They think foreigners will give more money丨Really lack integrity丨Really lack integrity丨" The other seemed even more indignant, saying "Really lack integrity" twice in a row.</p>
<p>I shuddered.</p>
<p>He actually demanded "integrity" from the rickshaw pullers! A certain celebrity who doesn't ride in rickshaws for "humanitarian" reasons (mentioning him reminds me of his two famous sayings: Soviet Russian ugly species, Jewish beast species. But this kind of voice seems to have disappeared now!) I've long heard his name: but demanding "integrity" from rickshaw pullers is a first for me. I think most gentlemen share the same opinion.</p>
<p>My point is not that rickshaw pullers shouldn't have integrity. But in this society where the comprador bourgeoisie rules everything, and all the high-ranking Chinese, scholars, and gentlemen are docile citizens and loyal dogs, this precious man is resentful of the rickshaw pullers' lack of integrity. I can't help but shudder. A rickshaw costs more than ten 角 in rental fees a day. The puller probably has a wife and children at home to support. He can't afford much "integrity" in order to pull a few more coins. If a certain celebrity changed his "not riding in rickshaws" to "giving rickshaw pullers more money," it might be more "humanitarian."</p>
<p>In fact, this thing called integrity seems to have long been extinct among the higher-ranking Chinese. On the other hand, it still exists a little bit among the lower classes like rickshaw pullers. For example, they know how to hate. If you have seen the expression on the face of the rickshaw puller mentioned above after being kicked, seen the way the pullers curse the police with gritted teeth, you will know what I mean by hate. As for the higher-ranking Chinese, they can only be docile citizens and dogs.</p>

<p>— Lin Huiyin</p>
<p>Although I lay in bed, I just couldn't sleep. When my thoughts were interrupted, I would hear the combined melody of the clock and the rain. Seeing the first light of day already squeezing in from the rain, I felt especially troubled. Seeing that I wouldn't be able to sleep, I simply got up.</p>
<p>It felt like I had a lot to talk about with someone, and then someone I could talk to entered my heart. So I decided to go find that person who had entered my heart.</p>
<p>He, the person who had entered my heart, lived in a village about forty minutes by train from the city, in a school. When the train arrived there, the rain wasn't very heavy. I didn't want to take a rickshaw, so I followed the road signs towards the school. But by the time I got to the school, my hat was soaked through, dripping water erratically. It was too embarrassing, as if I deliberately wanted to make the host look difficult. I felt a little uneasy.</p>
<p>Good, he wasn't at the school. They said he lived in the city and wouldn't have class until the afternoon, and asked me to either wait there or come back later. I didn't feel disappointed, but surprised, because I didn't expect him to not be there. Although, at this point, it seemed like I didn't necessarily have to see him. Because the things I wanted to talk to him about had completely disappeared in the vast rain. I wanted to return to the city, but the train wasn't for another hour and a half, so I went to a public tea house near the station to drink tea.</p>
<p>The tea house faced a small river, with a wooden bridge at the end of the river. Not far from the bridge were two or three sailboats. And, as if to accompany my loneliness, the rain continued to fall. The rain, the river, the bridge, the boats, congealed into a reversing car, sending me into the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. I sat on a long bench less than five inches wide, gazing at everything selflessly.</p>
<h3 id="e195">Hongkou Park <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>— Ma Guoliang</p>
<p>I don't usually like to go anywhere, but a foot ailment for a month has forced me to stay indoors all day, making me envious of those who can move freely. The day my foot got better was a Sunday, and the weather was so nice, so I went to nearby Hongkou Park by myself.</p>
<p>I hadn't been to Hongkou Park since the January 28th Incident. Many friends haven't been either, supposedly because there are too many Japanese people inside. However, I don't think that should be a reason not to go.</p>
<p>This is our land too. Why shouldn't we be happy to go to our own land?</p>
<p>After paying twenty cents, I was allowed to enter the "public" park, pacing alone on the cinder path, crossing the wooden bridge, walking on the grass, resting on the stones, and squatting by the stream. Even though I was alone, it had a different kind of fun. Looking here, running there, regarding others as scenery or a play, it's enough to keep you from feeling lonely.</p>
<p>Since the weather was good, there were many visitors, needless to say. Red, green, black, and white, all people, appearing and disappearing by the stream, by the trees, on the chairs, and on the grass. Among them, there were Westerners, Easterners, white people, yellow people, brown people... all kinds. Naturally, the most were our compatriots and the Japanese people seen every day in Hongkou.</p>
<p>There were all sorts of scenes. Two Westerners, perhaps debating the Sino-Japanese issue, were arguing red-faced. Two Indian women and a man with a white turban were flirting, entangled for a long time without any resolution. Japanese children were running around with sun flags, while Chinese children always hid beside their mothers or fathers. Japanese people were playing ball and fishing; Chinese people were smoking, strolling, chatting, and practicing Tai Chi.</p>
<p>This place is a paradise; people are all well-dressed, displaying a leisurely demeanor. With their bellies full, they come here for a walk to aid digestion, which is naturally necessary.</p>
<p>Here, there is no "world economic panic," no "outbreak of World War II," no "efforts to assist front-line soldiers," no "killing all the Japanese devils." Chinese people, Japanese people, everyone is smiling, not glaring at each other.</p>
<p>Therefore, this place can also be said to be Sino-Japanese amity, coexistence and co-prosperity, and even a world "already" advanced to Great Harmony.</p>
<p>After walking for a long time, I finally found a chair by the pond. Just as I sat down, I saw on the opposite bank, on a narrow path, a Chinese family and a Japanese family walking towards each other. They were all politely stepping aside to give way to each other. I couldn't help but sigh that Sino-Japanese relations were indeed amicable, and the world had indeed achieved Great Harmony! Fortunately, I hadn't even brought a newspaper to the park to read today, otherwise, if I had seen it writing about the fierce battles between the Chinese and Japanese in the Luan River, I would have definitely cursed the journalists for lying.</p>
<p>If the journalists weren't lying, and the Chinese and Japanese soldiers were really still fighting there; if we had the chance to tell a Japanese soldier that while he was risking his life on the battlefield, his compatriots were fishing in a park in our country. Who do you think he would aim his gun at when he heard that?</p>
<p>I remember seeing a cartoon by an American cartoonist with the caption: "War is encouraged by people who don't go to war... while people who don't want to go to war are forced to fight!" The cause and effect of wars throughout history have been mostly like this, and it's not unique to Japan!</p>
<p>As I walked out of the gate of this paradise of Great Harmony, I was immediately greeted by the grand Japanese barracks under construction, and passing in front of it were the Chinese Boy Scouts collecting donations for national aviation defense.</p>
<h3 id="e196">Airplane vs. Snail Race <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>— Ke Duo</p>
<p>In the world today, this "mysterious" country, the Soviet Union, has many unique things that people have never heard of or seen. Since implementing the Five-Year Economic Plan in 1928, it has implemented a unique and comical competition: an airplane vs. a snail race. Hearing this for the first time, one must find it very strange. In fact, the Soviet Union is not truly conducting an airplane vs. snail race; this is just a sign of the achievements of Socialist Competition.</p>
<p>What is Socialist Competition? This is Lenin's legacy. He said: "Socialism does not eliminate competition; on the contrary, it expands competition on the basis of the masses, so that the working masses can truly develop their talents. In today's implementation of socialism, our task is to organize this competition." This competition has now become widespread in all institutions throughout the Soviet Union: between industrial enterprises, between workshops within enterprises, between shock brigades (Shock Brigade丨a new type of physical labor organization founded by 120 young female workers at the "Red Triangle" factory in Leningrad in September 1926, which became a mass movement throughout the country by 1929), between individual workers, between industrial enterprises and agriculture, between state farms, between collective farms, and even between Soviets, armies, schools, hospitals, and nurseries and kindergartens.</p>
<p>The method of competition is that a certain workshop, enterprise, or state farm, proposes competition items to its counterpart in the same category, or to other appropriate counterparts. Both parties sign a contract and begin to implement the competition. A review committee determines the winner, and models such as airplanes, cars, streetcars, bicycles, turtles, and snails are used as symbols of the competition results. Those with excellent work have their factory names written on airplanes and cars, and are given prizes to show encouragement; those with poor work have their factory names written on turtles and snails, as a mark of shame.</p>
<p>What is the result of implementing Socialist Competition? The result is: the Five-Year Economic Plan was completed in four years. In the industrial sector, production plans were completed and exceeded predetermined figures, production costs were reduced, labor productivity was increased, production quality was improved, absenteeism and sabotage were reduced, and incidental expenses were reduced. In the agricultural sector, sown areas were expanded, farming methods were improved, rural electrification was accelerated, and wealthy peasants were eliminated. In various institutions, staff members worked quickly, and bureaucrats were purged.</p>

<p>The Blind Man</p>
<p>He gently tapped the door with the end of his cane.</p>
<p>"It's Repic's house 丨 what's he here for again, that fellow?"</p>
<p>"Repic 丨 Don't you know? He's here to get his six sous; it's the day he comes to collect his money. Let him in."</p>
<p>Repic's wife reluctantly ran to open the door, and because it was very cold outside, she grabbed the blind man's hand and dragged him inside roughly.</p>
<p>"Good morning, everyone!" said the blind man.</p>
<p>He walked inside. His cane moved slowly on the paved stone floor, as if chasing mice, until it encountered a chair. The blind man sat down and stretched his frozen hands towards the stove.</p>
<p>Repic took out a six-sous coin and said:</p>
<p>"Take it!"</p>
<p>Then he ignored him and continued to read his newspaper.</p>
<p>Carrot Top was playing. He squatted in a corner, watching the blind man's wooden shoes: the snow on the shoes was melting, and small streams of water were already visible around them.</p>
<p>Repic's wife saw it.</p>
<p>"Lend me your wooden shoes, old man," she said.</p>
<p>She took the wooden shoes and placed them under the fireplace, but it was too late; a mess of water had already been left on the floor. Feeling uneasy, the blind man's feet felt wet, and he kept lifting one foot and then the other, trying to get away from the muddy snow water, which only made the snow water spread further.</p>
<p>Carrot Top scratched the ground with his fingernails, as if pointing out the deeper cracks to the dirty water, calling it to flow towards him. "Since he's already got his six sous, what's he still sitting here for?" said Repic's wife, regardless of whether the blind man could hear her.</p>
<p>But the blind man was talking politics, at first hesitantly, but later more fluently. Sometimes when he finished speaking, he would wave his cane, hitting his fist on the stove's chimney, scalding himself. He quickly withdrew it, with a look of doubt on his face, his white eyeballs rolling in his tearful eyes.</p>
<p>Sometimes Repic would turn the newspaper over and say:</p>
<p>"That's right, Daddy Dixier, that's right, but do you think this matter is reliable?"</p>
<p>"You ask me if I think this matter is reliable!" the blind man shouted. "Ah, so such a thing has happened, that's too serious! Listen to me, Mr. Repic, let me tell you how I became blind."</p>
<p>"He's not going to leave," said Repic's wife.</p>
<p>Indeed, the blind man felt better here than outside. He recounted his accidental encounter, stretching his limbs, his whole body melting. Some ice cubes were melting in his veins, flowing along. His clothes and limbs seemed to be dripping with oil. The puddle of muddy water on the floor gradually increased, flowing towards Carrot Top, already reaching his side.</p>
<p>Carrot Top was the target of this muddy water flow.</p>
<p>Soon he would be able to play with this muddy water. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e200">National Goods Forum: National Goods and Tariffs <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>People who are shackled suffer from not being free, everyone knows this. Bad tariffs, layer upon layer of difficulties, this is the suffering of the national goods industry. If this shackle is not removed one day, then the national goods business will have no possibility of development one day. Our government has recently been sparing no effort to promote the national goods business, and is particularly aware of the suffering of the national goods industry. The financial and industrial authorities have also tried to find ways to curb the dumping of foreign goods and reduce the burden on the national goods industry. Recently, the national goods industry has also proposed that the government abolish the transit tax on Chinese-made machine-made goods, and appropriately reduce the import tax on essential raw materials, and increase the import tax on luxury and ordinary goods. It has formally requested the government to adopt it, and the main points are briefly stated as follows: It is found that the collection of a 5% ad valorem tax on machine-made Western-style goods transported and sold domestically, without re-collection, began in the late Qing Dynasty. At that time, it was originally intended to encourage Chinese people to operate new-style industries themselves, so that the Western-style goods they imitated could enjoy the same rights as foreign goods, namely one tax per item, and avoid the suffering of repeated levies. The original intention was extremely thoughtful. However, domestic industry was immature, and commercial power was weak. It was really unable to bear this tax system. After the establishment of the Republic of China, factories in North China repeatedly appealed for its abolition, but it was not approved because there was no way to compensate for the tax revenue. Later, in the thirteenth year of the Republic of China, an additional surcharge of 2.5% was added, making a total of 7.5% with the regular tax, increasing the burden and deepening the suffering. When the National Government moved south and customs autonomy was achieved, various transit taxes similar to likin throughout the country were abolished uniformly, but this transit tax on machine-made Western-style goods was still collected as before, without exemption. The nature of the transit tax is entirely a domestic transit tax, which is actually a type of likin. It should have been abolished at the same time as likin and various tax systems such as the sub-port tax and re-transit tax collected by the customs. Now the sub-port tax has been abolished, but the transit tax on machine-made Western-style goods still exists. In the past, foreign goods transported to the interior were restricted by the sub-port tax, so national goods could barely support themselves. Once the restriction of the foreign goods sub-port tax was lifted, national goods suddenly lost their protection. And this tax system on machine-made Western-style goods, which was originally established to encourage domestic industry, has become an obstacle to the development of domestic industry today. Foreign goods have taken the opportunity to oppress them, and they cannot compete with them. In recent years, factories across the country have been reducing their scale, to the point of suspending operations and closing down. Workers have been reducing their work, to the point of being laid off entirely, which is heard every day. People say that this year is the year of national goods, but it has turned into a year of foreign goods selling well, which is very painful. The government should have been aware of the painful situation of national goods factories. The reason why this tax system was not abolished at the same time as likin was probably because the government was worried about the national treasury revenue and could not give up on it hastily. However, since then, customs duties have been increased twice, and various unified taxes have also been implemented successively, but this transit tax is still delayed and not abolished, causing the national goods industry across the country to decline day by day, which seems to run counter to the government's repeated declarations to protect industry. The Central Political Conference has now resolved to revise the tariff in May of this year. It is believed that this is the best opportunity for our country to relieve the suffering of national industry and commerce and implement a protectionist tariff policy. It is hoped that the government will take into account the imminent danger of national industry, and resolutely abolish this transit tax on machine-made Western-style goods, which is similar to likin, in order to maintain industry and relieve merchants' difficulties. As for the abolition of this tax system, if the revenue from the previous increases in customs duties and the implementation of unified taxes is still insufficient to compensate, it seems that the import tax on foreign goods can be appropriately increased to supplement it. Now that our country's customs sovereignty has been restored, and at this time of revising the tariff again, it coincides with the time when various countries in the world are increasing tariff barriers. It is appropriate to take this opportunity to increase import taxes to alleviate national expenditures. It is proposed to increase the tax rate on imported foreign luxury goods and ordinary goods separately and appropriately. The import tax on raw materials that are lacking in our country's industry and must be supplied from foreign countries is proposed to be appropriately reduced or exempted. For raw materials that our country can manufacture itself without relying on foreign countries, it is also requested to uniformly increase the tax rate, and not be included in the above-mentioned reduction or exemption, in order to conform to the original purpose of protectionist tariffs. In this shift, the national treasury revenue will be surplus, and factories and workers across the country will be rescued. This sincere opinion is the goal of the national goods industry. It is hoped that the government will adopt it as much as possible when deliberating on the tariff, and allow national goods industry groups to send representatives to attend and participate, so as to be consulted. The life and death of the national goods industry depends on this. It is thought that the government authorities, in order to maintain a lifeline for industry, will certainly meet the expectations of our industrial and commercial circles across the country.</p>
<p>National Goods Talk</p>
<h3 id="e201">From the Sound of National Goods to Children's Toys <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>— Huang Jiafu</p>
<p>In industrially backward China, the daily needs of the people have always been supplied by imported goods. As a result, our country's profits are flowing out, the economy is on the verge of bankruptcy, politics are not on track, internal turmoil is frequent, and foreign disasters occur every year. The country is about to perish, which is so painful to say! From now on, if we do not think about saving the country, then so be it. If we want to save the country, then "promoting national goods to recover profits" is indeed a fundamental plan. However, just shouting the slogan "national goods save the country" is useless. We must improve the existing national goods and promote those that do not exist, so that all goods meet the needs of the people and are practical for the people. Then the people will not buy foreign goods but only national goods.</p>
<p>Our country's children's toys are mostly purchased from foreign countries. Although there are no statistics on this loss at present, it must also be a considerable amount. Moreover, children are the future masters of the country, and their toys should be promoted and improved to cater to their psychology and be practical for their play. So that they are happy to buy and use them, cultivate their habit of loving and using national goods, and enlighten their ideas of loving and supporting the country. In this sound of national goods, it is even more necessary. Based on my limited knowledge, I will briefly state the conditions that children's toys should have, as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Must contain educational value.</p>
<p>(2) Must be in accordance with children's hygiene.</p>
<p>(3) Must have beautiful form and solid material.</p>
<p>(4) Must be in accordance with the principle of economy.</p>
<p>(5) Must have multi-faceted activities.</p>
<p>(6) Must have collective use.</p>
<p>(7) Must have no dangerous elements.</p>
<p>(8) Must have no gambling elements.</p>
<h3 id="e202">Goal <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>— Ke Ding'an</p>
<p>In the eyes of ordinary pleasure-seeking friends, the two words "goal" are very unnecessary, because their lives are casual and drifting along, and there is no need for a "goal." But for ordinary sober and active people, whatever they do, they must first set a goal, and then do it according to this goal, so that they can get on track step by step and have a day of success.</p>
<p>What kind of era is it today? We must first recognize it! Foreign aggression cannot be said to be not urgent, and internal strife cannot be said to be not intense. At this critical juncture, what is the most important problem facing us? Of course, there are many, many important problems! Such as air defense facilities, replenishment of armaments, unity of the people, consensus on political views... etc., are all important problems: but I think the most important problem is "using national goods" is relatively important!</p>
<p>"Using national goods" is something that all people across the country can implement uniformly, easily, and is easier to solve than all other problems. Everything in life that is needed can be done in the direction of "using national goods."</p>
<p>However, in our country, where foreign goods are flooding all provinces and villages, and the general public has been assimilated for almost several decades, although they have also performed a "promoting national goods" farce for more than ten years, there are still many who are indifferent. If, back in the fourth year of the Republic, when the Twenty-One Demands were being forced upon us, the people across the country, in accordance with "uniting as one, resisting × goods," had continued until now for more than ten years, I think many historical stains would not have been established, and the tragedies of the September 18th and January 28th incidents would never have happened. What is the reason for this? I think it's not bizarre, nor complicated. It's just that the general public, in the beginning, did not have a clear goal to strive for in "promoting national goods and resisting Japanese goods." If we had really "united as one" and implemented it in the fourth year of the Republic, I think the results now would definitely not be bad!</p>
<p>The fact is unfolding before our eyes. This kind of empty shouting of "promoting national goods and resisting inferior goods" is equal to zero. It not only does not help the actual situation, but also cannot deal with the temporary situation. What else can we do besides standing up and striving for it?</p>
<p>In Shanghai, which is extremely Westernized, we have also suffered the pain of foreign aggression once: but the wealthy people with "millions of dollars" have their good defenses, money. Of course, they will not suffer any pain, but at least it will twitch their brains a little.</p>
<p>The booming sound of cannons and the whirring sound of machine guns have of course become a thing of the past, and our purchase of × goods has also returned to normal! According to the latest report from the customs, taking × goods cotton cloth as an example, in the first and second months, it actually exceeded the large number of more than 840,000 gold units, which is indeed a terrible news that "shakes the heavens and moves the earth, makes ghosts weep and gods cry"!</p>
<p>The creation of this terrible news is undeniably our general public! But our people, none of them are willing to directly admit this crime, which also means that none of them can shirk the burden of this major crime!</p>
<h3 id="e203">Children and National Goods Fashion <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Mengzhao</p>
<p>In cities full of Western-style fashion, it is not easy to promote the prevalence of national goods fashion. So-called modern women, in clothing, food, housing, and transportation, if they do not worship Westernization, they cannot be praised as modern or fashionable. Even if it is ten yuan per foot of foreign silk, they have no worries. They can charm their husbands and lovers, forcing them to drain the pond to get the fish. To hope that they will implement national cloth fashion is simply like asking a tiger for its skin. I think that to promote national goods fashion, we must start with boys and girls. Fathers and brothers should often take their children to national goods companies to arouse their interest in national goods fashion. The two words "national goods" will be deeply imprinted in their minds from an early age. It can be said that there will be unexpected effects. The day before yesterday, I took my four-year-old second son, Changhong, to Sanyou Society to buy clothes. When we went, he was wearing a red crepe Western dress, which was gorgeous and dazzling. But when we put a national cloth Western suit from the national goods company on him, he immediately wanted to abandon the red crepe Western dress and put on the national goods fashion. After we allowed him to change, he was innocent and cheerful, and his spirit was particularly lively. In his little heart, he also seemed very happy. It only cost one yuan, so children and national goods fashion are like electricity and motors!</p>
<p>I think: "The past is like yesterday is dead, the future is like today is born." From now on, we must recognize the goal, and strive to implement the phrase "using national goods." Let us "unite as one" and do it. Everything we need in clothing, food, housing, and transportation should be taken from national goods. Let us no longer act perfunctorily and deceive ourselves. On the one hand, customs imports will decrease day by day, and on the other hand, domestic productivity will increase day by day. Then, those who are arrogant about economic aggression will feel exhausted and eventually perish. At that time: the domestic economy will be prosperous, the people's livelihood will be affluent, there will be no unemployed people, and factories will stand tall. Then, we will not lose the demeanor of the Republic of China, which has thousands of years of history and thousands of years of civilization. This great foundation is completely built on the two words "goal."</p>
<p>National Goods Discussion</p>
<h3 id="e204">New Hopes for China National Goods Company <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>— Wu Zhongfan</p>
<p>China National Goods Company has been established for several months, and its business is booming, which has never been seen in major shopping malls. This shows that the Chinese people love to use national goods, and the company's sincere promotion is sparing no effort. However, after visiting the interior, there are still four shortcomings, which are specifically described below, in order to improve the company.</p>
<p>(1) Accurate Price Marking When entering the building, you can see a piece of white cloth hanging on the wall, on which the prices of various goods are written, starting from a few cents. But when buying, you cannot find the goods of that price, which seems to lose the trust of customers.</p>
<p>(2) Inexpensive Selling Price In recent years, the economy has declined, money has been scarce, and the psychology of ordinary people buying goods is to focus on cheap items. All discount stores in the market are crowded. If the price of goods in the company can be cheaper than other stores, in order to attract customers, the effect of promoting national goods will be greater, and the company's funds will also be easier to circulate.</p>
<p>(3) Expansion of the Shopping Mall The interior location is too small. If customers come in groups of three or five, there will be crowding, which not only reduces the interest of customers, but also easily damages the displayed goods. It is heard that the southern part has been added, and it is hoped that it will be realized as soon as possible.</p>
<p>(4) Printing and Sending National Goods Manuals In recent years, the manufacture of national goods has been changing with each passing day, and the quantity of products has also been gradually increasing. Unfortunately, the Chinese people cannot fully know it, and there are still many who buy foreign goods. If the company can compile a national goods manual, stating the goods and the factories that manufacture them, and give them to customers, although it costs very little, the sales of national goods will be promoted, and the company's business will be more prosperous than it is today.</p>
<h3 id="e205">Two Fabrics Urgently Awaiting Improvement <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Jingyu</p>
<p>丨“Self-Strengthening Serge” and “Camel Wool”丨</p>
<p>Regardless of the type of fabric, durability should always be the primary concern; that is, the material should be strong and the color should not fade. Otherwise, it is not a top-quality, authentic product, but rather what is colloquially known as a shoddy product. How can a shoddy product be welcomed by society and expect to sell without any obstruction? However, most of the machine-woven products in China today are plagued by the problem of being shoddy due to being crudely made and not meticulously crafted. The “Self-Strengthening Serge” and “Camel Wool” are prominent examples of this! Now, I am specifically bringing them up for discussion in order to draw the attention of the manufacturers.</p>
<p>New Machine Introduction</p>
<h3 id="e206">Two Domestically Produced Machines <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>— Zhenmu</p>
<p>▲ Adding, Subtracting, Multiplying, and Dividing Calculator 丨丨 This machine was invented and manufactured by Mr. Qian Jinghua of Changshu. It uses the rotation of gears to manually calculate numbers. The machine has a rather small and exquisite appearance, occupying only 2/27 of a cubic foot in volume, making it easy to carry and with a suitable design. The whole machine is divided into three main parts: the real number, the operator number, and the result number. On the two circles of the real and operator numbers, nine digits can be arranged, and the answer machine can have as many as fifteen digits. This type of calculator is already widely popular in foreign countries, and our country is the first to produce it. According to the reporter's observation, the structure of this machine is more advanced than that of foreign products. The advantages include the ability to freely place and correct numbers, the agility of advancing and retreating, the ability to arbitrarily designate and recognize units, the rapid operation of decimals and fractions, the convenience of carrying, and so on.</p>
<p>▲ Panoramic Camera 丨丨 This machine was also invented by Mr. Qian. Ordinary foreign rotating cameras used in photo studios weigh as much as seventeen or eighteen pounds, causing the hands of the person holding it to ache, and the assembly mechanism is also very clumsy. Now, this domestically produced machine, including the lens box and turntable, weighs less than ten pounds, and the shutter light device and the turntable's center of gravity are all very much in line with scientific principles. The suitability of the speed and the accuracy of the distance are also beyond what foreign products can achieve. It is truly an outstanding product of domestic machinery industry and worthy of being advocated and promoted by the Chinese people.</p>
<p>Currently, the domestic goods industry in our country, apart from genuine native products, mostly focuses on efforts in cosmetics and the like. Few people are working on this type of mechanical industry because the effort is doubled and the results are difficult to achieve. Mr. Qian, the inventor of the above two machines, was diligent and thrifty, and began research twenty years ago. He personally operated the machines, and even small screws with a diameter of one hao (a unit of measurement) were manufactured by himself. Therefore, these two machines are truly worthy of being completely domestically produced. However, even after success, the sales have not reached five years, simply because of the lack of publicity, very few Chinese people know about them. And the inventor does not care about fame and fortune, and strives to improve them. Furthermore, most merchants believe in foreign goods that are bulky and inflexible, and despise domestic products. They are willing to buy foreign goods worth one or two thousand yuan, but do not think about buying these domestic products worth six or seven hundred yuan. Therefore, sales have not yet been promoted. It should be known that these two machines are indeed exquisitely made and are not only special products of domestic production, but these two machines have also been registered for patents by the US government, and some have been shipped for sale. I hope that my compatriots will rise up together to advocate their use in order to save our rights and interests.</p>

<p>"Self-Strengthening Serge," also known as "Domestic Vienna," originally belonged to a type of cloth. It is said that its structure is silk warp and yarn weft, made by connecting the leftover silk ends from reeling: therefore, there are many small knots on the cloth surface, resembling "pongee," and it looks quite beautiful when new. Unfortunately, the color is terrible. Not to mention that the color fades after a single wash for single-layer clothing, even cotton-padded clothing will change color slightly when exposed to sunlight. Eventually, it deteriorates more and more, looking like old, worn-out things found in the corner of a box, how ugly!</p>
<p>"Camel Wool" is indeed cheaper than foreign goods, and the patterns are no less than foreign goods! However, the effectiveness is far worse; because the texture is very loose, after wearing it for only a few days, the wool fibers will immediately act like cotton, and strands will turn into locks; this alone makes it inelegant. What's more, it will slowly fall off, and the wool fibers will become bare. There is no warmth to speak of!</p>
<p>The above are all major shortcomings! This is not intentional nitpicking, but because the reporter is also one of the supporters of domestic goods, and therefore has to offer well-intentioned advice! I hope that the manufacturers of these two fabrics will quickly remedy the aforementioned shortcomings to achieve perfection! Only then can they compete in the market and compete with foreign goods! If the good advice falls on deaf ears and they stick to their old ways, then when will there be a day for the revitalization of domestic goods?</p>

<h3 id="e207">Domestic Goods Under the Oppression of a False Regime <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>— Zhao Peng</p>
<p>Since the Japanese occupied our Northeast, they have paid great attention to our domestic goods. Goods shipped from Shanghai, Hankou, Tianjin, and other places are considered foreign goods and are subject to heavy taxes. Japanese goods and foreign goods are exempt from taxes, so the price of Japanese goods is 60% lower than that of domestic goods.</p>
<p>The Japanese have repeatedly sent personnel to inspect self-run factories, and they also levy a 25% business tax on their entire business every month. If it is not paid for more than two months, they will be closed down and all property in the store will be confiscated.</p>
<p>In the past, silk satin, homespun cloth, silk fabrics, and cotton fabrics sold well in the Northeast. Now, the Japanese have ordered customs to prohibit imports on the one hand, and on the other hand, they have transported Japanese woolen fabrics, thin silk fabrics, and foreign cloth to the Northeast as much as possible to replace our silk fabrics and cotton fabrics. As a result, our Chinese silk fabrics and cotton fabrics have completely disappeared in the Northeast, and thousands of merchants have closed down one after another. Many southern merchants have closed their businesses and gone south.</p>
<h3 id="e208">My Sister-in-Law's Experience <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>— Yili</p>
<p>We believe that women's clothing is not only related to appearance and hygiene, but also has a profound and significant relationship with the economy of the family.</p>
<p>We also have no hesitation in saying that women's attention to and consideration of clothing are dozens or hundreds of times deeper than men's; because the innate love of beauty can prompt her to study how she can increase her extra beauty. Clothing is certainly the first requirement, and the suitability of tailoring and the selection of clothing materials are a large part of their daily lives. If her father, brothers, or husband is not wealthy, it is easy to develop a kind of depression from being unable to satisfy her desires.</p>
<p>Clever girls and virtuous wives can sometimes restrain their desires and consider the family's finances, and do not often add to their clothes; but such women are indeed relatively few.</p>
<p>Especially young girls, in the golden age like flowers, it would be a pity if they did not have beautiful fashions to wear. In Shanghai or the inland areas near Shanghai, a generation of girls have suffered significant losses and serious lessons because of clothing, which is already very obvious. Their shortcomings are because their understanding of fashion is not yet clear. First, they cannot tailor themselves; second, they cannot create themselves; third, they do not understand how to choose clothing materials. They only know to consult tailors, only know to buy expensive imported goods, and only know to imitate the styles created by others. It is naturally very uneconomical and inconvenient to buy imported goods and consult tailors for every piece of clothing.</p>
<p>My brother recently married a clever sister-in-law. She is indeed beautiful, but she cannot be considered very beautiful. The clothes she wears are not only fashionable, but also often have new styles. Many relatives and friends praised her as a fashion expert. I do not quite believe that my brother has so much money to provide her to spend on clothing, nor have I ever seen tailors come to our house to deliver new clothes to her.</p>
<p>As we became more familiar, I brought up this doubt and asked her in very appropriate words, and carefully investigated her, and found out that every night, she was hiding in her room, carefully sewing clothes herself, so she was able to use her intelligence to create various different styles of fashion.</p>
<p>She also told me: The beauty of women's clothing does not depend entirely on the clothing material, but on whether the tailoring is suitable. Often general clothing materials, the excess scraps, (whether they are leftover from the width or the remaining length,) are carefully kept. Sometimes they can also be used when tailoring other clothes. Imported goods are too expensive, so naturally choose domestic goods. For example: for summer clothing materials now, double crepe and georgette, there are many products from domestic manufacturers such as the Meya Silk Weaving Factory; and new patterns are emerging one after another. As long as you choose for yourself, whichever pattern is suitable for your environment, suitable for your age, self-tailoring and skin color, buy it and tailor it yourself, then you have it.</p>
<p>In Shanghai now, the common practice is that the money to buy a piece of clothing material may not be very expensive (unless you buy luxurious imported goods), but the tailoring fee is very high; or even more expensive than the clothing material. That will affect the family's finances.</p>
<p>Therefore, to wear fashionable clothes, the best thing to do is to learn how to tailor first; otherwise, at a minimum, you must buy domestic goods, and domestic silk crepe from the Continental Commercial Market China National Goods Company is the most reliable, and the price is the most suitable. According to my sister-in-law's experience, buying imported georgette to make a cheongsam, if you ask a tailor to tailor it, and buying Meya factory georgette and tailoring it yourself, the money used is a ratio of three to one; in other words, if you buy foreign clothing material and do not tailor it yourself, you can only wear one piece. If you buy domestic clothing material and tailor it yourself with the same amount of money, you can wear three pieces, is this not very economical?</p>
<p>The styles of fashion change very quickly. If you often want to wear fashionable clothes, it is very uneconomical; rather than spending a sum of money to only wear one piece, why not wear three pieces?</p>

<h3 id="e210">Domestic Goods in Pinghu <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>— Sun Choucheng</p>
<p>When the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association of the six counties formerly belonging to Jia prefecture in Zhejiang held its second joint meeting, it invited members of the Shanghai Domestic Goods Factory Federation to go to various counties to open a mobile exhibition of domestic goods. Starting from March 7th, they went from Jiashan to Jiaxing, from Jiaxing to Haiyan, and from Haiyan to Pinghu. The visitors were very enthusiastic, which shows that the mentality of promoting domestic goods has become widespread among the people. When Jiashan, Jiaxing, and Haiyan opened, Choucheng was unable to leave Shanghai due to business and was unable to participate in the grand ceremony. When Pinghu opened the other day, he took the time to go and record what he saw and heard as follows: The exhibition hall and temporary market were located in Zhongshan Park. The place is commonly known as Hudun, which is located in Donghu. A bridge is being built to connect the street, and it is surrounded by water on three sides, making the scenery excellent. When it opened, the Xinmin Grand Theater was borrowed, and many representatives from various agencies and groups came. There were eye-catching illustrations posted on both sides, one saying "Do not forget September 18th," depicting the miserable situation of Japanese soldiers trampling on the three northeastern provinces, with the words "Japanese soldiers, Japanese soldiers, truly wolf-hearted, pouring out their naval, land, and air forces, trying to swallow our entire Chinese territory." The other says "Avenge shame and revenge," depicting the situation of King Goujian of Yue sleeping on firewood and tasting gall, with the words "Returned after being released for three years, sleeping on firewood and tasting gall, tasting gall is not bitter, sleeping on firewood hurts the skin, to record the shame of Kuaiji, never forget, twenty years like a moment, to strengthen oneself, and finally govern the state of Wu, the meaning of avenging shame is manifested." The audience was moved by it. Chairman Yu Pinzhang delivered an opening speech, saying that in the past, the people of our country had repeatedly suffered from the economic devastation and oppression of imperialism, and there have been several anti-foreign goods movements, and at the beginning, all were rising up like a storm, but after the event passed and the situation changed, the enthusiasm gradually decreased, and it disappeared like smoke, only to be ridiculed by foreigners, so in the future, promoting domestic goods should not be</p>
<h3 id="e211">On Domestic Goods Trademarks <a href="#e211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>— Manbin</p>
<p>A trademark is a sign of a commodity. If a commodity has credit, then people will have no doubt about buying goods at the sight of the trademark. The common saying old brand means that the brand has supreme value. In the past, trademarks in our country did not go beyond the names of Tianguan, Longevity Star, Harmony, Eight Immortals, Four Joys, Auspicious, and Ruyi, which were passed down layer by layer and were easy to confuse. Recently, the domestic goods industry has been developing day by day, and domestic products are also increasing day by day. Attention is also being paid to the exclusive use of trademarks. The government has set up a special bureau to be in charge of it, and factories regard commodities as the sole life of the entire factory. Therefore, the issue of trademarks has aroused unanimous attention in society and is felt to be a very interesting issue. In terms of the characteristics of trademarks, there are all kinds of colors and strange shapes, which are the best of ingenuity. In my opinion, the most important thing about a trademark is that it is simple and easy to remember. The triangle of Three Friends and the three stars of China are so simple and concise. Taking materials and homophony is also full of fun. The butterfly of Invincible and the five geese of Wuhe are examples of this. Taking animals as materials, there are standing cranes and flying tigers, flying horses, and dog heads. Taking plants as materials, there are ink chrysanthemums and evergreens. There are goddesses like Chang'e, and ghosts like Zhong Kui, everything is available, and the efforts of the factory authorities are so commendable and admirable. However, trademarks are dead objects, and commodities are also inactive. If you want commodities to be sold, you must rely entirely on the refinement of manufacturing and have credit. If you do not produce crudely, do not cut corners, then the reputation will get better and better, and any trademark can spread without legs.</p>
<p>Publicity should have practical work, and jointly seek industrial development. At a minimum, the following basic conditions should be met: (1) Break the inferiority of superstitious foreign goods, (2) Develop the habit of loving and using domestic goods. Now, the fierce and stubborn Japanese imperialists have seized our land and are taking further steps to destroy our nation. If we want to avenge our shame and revitalize the national fortune, we must permanently break off economic relations with Japan and promote domestic goods consistently. County government representative Shen Mengyang gave a detailed account of the annual excess imports. County Party representative Yang Zaoshi said that the previous promotion of domestic goods movement in Pinghu was mostly done in words or verbally, which was abstract. This time, inviting domestic goods factories in Shanghai and Hangzhou to bring their products for display was unprecedented and practical. County backbone team representative Fan Liming gave a speech, asking vendors to abandon foreign goods and sell domestic goods in the future, and asking producers to study carefully so that domestic goods can become better and better and surpass imported goods. Finally, Domestic Goods Federation representative Ma Jisheng gave a reply on behalf of all manufacturers, which was a grand occasion at the time.</p>
<p>Interview Notes</p>
<h3 id="e212">Mr. Hu Xiyuan <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>— Yueyun</p>
<p>Anyone who runs a real business is worthy of admiration, especially in our country where production is backward.</p>
<p>To run a real business, you must have the following conditions in order to achieve considerable success. What are those conditions? They are: (1) Endurance of labor and hardship. (2) Willingness to sacrifice. (3) Strong capital. (4) Utmost impartiality and selflessness. (5) Broad vision.</p>
<p>Because they can endure labor and hardship, they can safely cross the turbulent waves when they encounter them. Because they are willing to sacrifice, they still strive and fight hard when they clearly know they will lose money, arousing the belief of ordinary people. With strong capital, they can continue to compete with foreign goods. With the spirit of utmost impartiality and selflessness, they can share the joys and sorrows with others. With a broad vision, they will not produce crudely and seek temporary benefits. Those who run real businesses in our country who can meet these conditions will definitely succeed.</p>
<p>Mr. Hu Xiyuan's China Yaopuer Electric Appliance Factory, I heard that since its opening, it has gone through many storms, and the dumping of foreign goods and the infighting of the same industry have been able to pass smoothly. This cannot but be attributed to Mr. Hu's perseverance.</p>
<p>Because the China Yaopuer Electric Appliance Factory has a considerable position in the current domestic goods industry, and at the same time, I heard friendly rumors, I also have a considerable understanding of this Mr. Hu, so I resolutely went to visit him. Mr. Hu's kind appearance, sincere attitude, and told me the history of China Yaopuer Electric Appliance Factory in detail, such as opening in 1925, adding from tens of thousands of capital to one hundred thousand, then to two hundred thousand, three hundred thousand, and now it is five hundred thousand. From ordinary houses of three rooms and two sides, it has expanded to buying land and building new-style factory buildings for the glass department, the light bulb department, and the motor department. Although it has experienced several storms in the meantime, it has always been determined to remain calm and deal with them by chance. He had no arrogance, nor did he have any words of sigh, always smiling very kindly.</p>
<p>He led me to visit the glass department, where the furnace was blazing, and dozens of workers were picking materials, blowing bubbles, and working very quickly. When I arrived at the light bulb department, there were about two hundred male and female workers. Here, except for the rattling of the machines, it was almost silent. Some were installing hooks, some were stretching silk, and some were exhausting air, all of which were divided into labor and cooperation. Finally, I went to the motor department on Poyang Road in Yangshupu. There, the fields were surrounded by fields and the air was very good. There were about one hundred workers, divided into several groups: fitter, lathe worker, painter, assembler, etc. The work was very intense, and it turned out that the fan was about to be in season.</p>
<p>After returning from the visit, I gave Mr. Hu a two-word comment in my opinion, which is "sincere." For the Yaopuer Electric Appliance Factory, there are sixteen words to evaluate it, which are "talented people are gathered. The equipment is complete. Work hard to manufacture. Products are of high quality."</p>

<p>— Jingcun</p>
<p>In the film supplement of a certain Japanese newspaper last month, there was a segment about Clara Bow's life in Europe. I do not avoid the crime of plagiarism and copy it once.</p>
<p>Clara Bow's Patriotic Enthusiasm</p>
<p>"Clara Bow and her husband have been traveling in Europe for more than a month now. According to news from Europe, since Clara Bow arrived in Europe, she has not bought any items for her daily use except for food, not even an underwear. When it is absolutely necessary, she must also buy American products from the store. Clara Bow made many clothes in the United States before she set off, worth about eight thousand gold yuan, so although she changes the style of her clothes every day in Paris, she still does not feel a lack. Paris merchants originally expected to do good business this time when Clara Bow arrived in Europe, but unexpectedly, Clara Bow was determined not to buy anything but American goods. Generally, people felt unexpected. However, French merchants do not resent Clara Bow's patriotism because they have not done good business, and they respect Clara Bow very much." After reading this news, I couldn't help but feel ashamed. Clara Bow is a world-famous movie star. Although she earned a lot of money from foreigners in her home country, this time when she went to Europe, the merchants in Paris were hoping to earn some decoration expenses from her, but they were disappointed. Clara Bow did not buy even an underwear, let alone other jewelry and new clothes, but French merchants did not resent her for not being able to do business with her, but respected her for not forgetting to buy domestic goods even after becoming a star.</p>
<p>Why do I feel ashamed after reading this news? Think about it, has any Chinese movie star won world honors? Despite the flattery of boring writers, their art and their words and deeds do not seem to arouse our respect and admiration. I am an outsider to the art of film, so I will not discuss how the film saves the country, we have not yet seen it, but there are full-page advertisements in newspapers every day, and movie stars personally sign to promote foreign goods and prove foreign goods. Movie stars are worthy of being loyal servants to foreign merchants, using foreign goods themselves, and also advising ordinary people to use foreign goods. I think, if Clara Bow came to Shanghai and saw this phenomenon, she would definitely say "Bah, is this called a star?" I think Chinese stars are really ashamed!</p>
<h3 id="e214">Astounding Absurdities <a href="#e214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>I am a tumbler that grew up in the Great China Domestic Goods Toy Factory. My father is also Chinese, and my mother is also Chinese. In summary, I am indeed an unadulterated descendant of the Yellow Emperor: However, less than half a month after I grew up completely in the factory, our boss sent me and my four or five hundred brothers to a tall company with seven or eight floors, and let us rest in a large glass cabinet.</p>
<p>After a few days, a team of tumblers that looked similar to us suddenly came. I secretly paid attention to their backs, and saw that the four characters "China National Goods" were also engraved. I thought they were always our compatriots, so I went over to greet them, but unexpectedly they couldn't understand my words, and I couldn't understand a single word they said either. The most surprising thing to me was that what they said was neither Cantonese nor Hokkien, but sounded somewhat like Japanese.</p>
<p>Later, one of them who could speak Chinese secretly told me; "To be honest, we all came from Japan. Unexpectedly, when we arrived in Shanghai, merchants of your country engraved the four characters "China National Goods" on our backs, and I don't even know why?"</p>
<p>After listening to his words, I was in a daze and confused when a customer happened to come outside. The clerk was busy greeting him with a smile.</p>
<p>"Do you want to buy domestic toys? Very good, this is a genuine domestic product!" The customer first said that he wanted to buy a domestic tumbler, and the clerk agreed non-stop, but he reached in and deliberately picked a fake domestic product from Japan.</p>
<p>"Sir, look how good this is, and the price is cheap, half the price of the other one!" The clerk said with a burst of flattery, and the customer was fooled, and paid the money very satisfied and left with the fake domestic product.</p>
<p>"Hee hee...". The clerk was overjoyed and laughed out loud. I was full of fire with hatred, but unfortunately I couldn't move my hands, otherwise I would have given him a slap in the face.</p>

Although the people of Peiping and Tianjin are somewhat panicked due to the war, they will not suddenly move south. The rumor that all universities in Peiping and Tianjin have stopped classes and are about to move south is inaccurate.</p>

<h3 id="e219">Ministry of Education Requests Increased Funding from the Ministry of Finance Due to Financial Strain <a href="#e219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>▲ Hoping for Equal Treatment with Other Ministries</p>
<p>The original budget for the Ministry of Education was 42,000 yuan per month. After the national crisis, the Ministry of Finance allocated 21,000 yuan. After deducting 2,500 yuan for the Compilation and Translation Bureau, the actual amount received was 18,500 yuan. In the past, the Ministry relied on the relief from the Zhejiang Province's poppy tax. Since the poppy tax can no longer be paid as usual, difficulties have been felt. The Ministry of Education, considering that the majority of other ministries have already received 70% or more of their allocated funds, while the Ministry of Education has only received 50%, and the actual expenditure, even after reductions due to the national crisis, is still above 70% of the original budget, has specially requested the Ministry of Finance to follow the precedent of other ministries and provide 70% of the Ministry of Education's funding starting from May, in order to alleviate the situation.</p>

<h3 id="e222">Cai Yuanpei Discusses the Feasibility of Independent Education Funding <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>Regarding independent education funding, Zheng Hongnian, when he was Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan, drafted a method that was discussed and decided upon by the Executive Yuan's council, and then handed over to Jia Shiyi of the Ministry of Finance and Duan Xipeng of the Ministry of Education to jointly draft a method and submit it for review. However, due to the outbreak of the Shanghai Battle, it was shelved. Now, the Shanghai University Teachers' Association believes that reorganizing education requires making independent education funding the current urgent task, so it has specially initiated the organization of a committee to protect independent education funding, dedicated to this matter. According to Cai Yuanpei, a member of the committee, protecting independent education funding was originally one of the Chinese Nationalist Party's policies, and it was decided to allocate the Boxer Indemnity as education funding. Currently, the universities in North China still use the Boxer Indemnity as part of their education funding. The new Minister of Education, Mr. Wang Xueting, has always paid close attention to independent education funding. If there is a concrete method for this matter, it seems that it will not be difficult to see it realized.</p>

As this semester is coming to an end, this is the final urging to complete and submit the forms to the Bureau promptly, without further delay. This is crucial."</p>

<h3 id="e227">The Last Telegram Received by Jiaotong University Before the Fall of Tangshan <a href="#e227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>▲ 5 PM Last Saturday</p>
<p>▲ No News Since Then</p>
<p>The situation in Tangshan after its fall is unclear. The National Jiaotong University in Shanghai has an engineering college located there. After the outbreak of the fighting in eastern Luan, all the students began evacuating to Shanghai last month. All the school equipment was also shipped to Tianjin by the college's president, Sun Hongzhe. Only a few staff members and laborers were left behind in Tangshan to guard the premises. However, the college had a radio station that could communicate with the Shanghai campus daily, so the situation there was very clear. However, after 5 PM last Saturday, the college's radio station suddenly went silent. The university authorities made several attempts to contact them, but were unable to. Although telegrams were also sent to the Tangshan train station via the railway telegraph line in an attempt to inquire about the college's situation, there was no reply. As a result, the situation there is impossible to ascertain. The telegram sent at 5 PM last Saturday stated that the situation there was already very chaotic, with unfavorable news from the front lines pouring in like snowflakes. The local garrison troops were retreating without fighting. Many of the major factories in the area owned by Chinese were tragically bombed by Japanese planes. However, the college was fortunately still safe. From this observation, the situation in Tangshan was already extremely dangerous last Saturday afternoon, and the area fell that evening. Because the college had a radio station, the Japanese army must have immediately dispatched a team to guard it. The silence of the college's radio station may be due to the Japanese army's tyrannical obstruction.</p>

<p>To Participate in Obstacle Racing</p>
<p>The representatives of various countries at this year's International Track and Field Games have decided to hold the games on June 24th. The organization and all other matters related to our Chinese team have been entrusted to Rong Qizhao, Jiang Xiangqing, Shen Kunnan, Shen Guoquan, Wang Fudan, Sun Duoqi, and Peng Sanmei by the Sports Promotion Association to serve as committee members and oversee everything.

<p>▲ Seeking Participants for Obstacle Race Training. Mr. McKenna, a Westerner, proposed adding a 1000-meter obstacle race event to this year's International Games. However, because Chinese people do not practice this sport often, it is proposed to temporarily change it to a demonstration event. Now, in order for Chinese people to understand the interest in obstacle racing, Mr. McKenna is specially seeking twelve Chinese people to participate in the demonstration. However, the qualifications for these people are that they have some knowledge of sports but are not yet famous. According to Mr. McKenna, if there are any Chinese who meet the above qualifications and are willing to participate, they can go to the General Traffic Office on the third floor of the Old Police Station on Simalu to register with Mr. Sun Zhi or contact Mr. Huang Shengbai of the Chinese Sports Association at the Chinese Athletics Field every morning from 5:30 AM to 6:30 AM.

As a result of the battles between the schools, Fudan Shizhong won the right to the finals in Group A, and Daxia Affiliated Middle School won the right to the finals in Group B. The committee has scheduled a final match for this month on the 23rd at the athletic field to determine the championship. The matches yesterday were most exciting between Hujiang and Daxia. Every game was tense. The difference between the two sides was sometimes only one or two points. After a stalemate of one point each, the third game was even more intense. However, in the end, Hujiang lost to Daxia with a score of 24 to 16. The Hujiang team, which had won the Central School Four-School Volleyball Championship for four consecutive years, has now surrendered the title.

<p>There were originally five schools participating in the girls' volleyball demonstration, but Tuzhong, Jinan, and Fuzhong successively withdrew due to various reasons. Only Guanghua and Daxia remained. The two sides held the finals at the China Athletic Field yesterday afternoon. As a result, Guanghua defeated Daxia with a score of 2 to 0 and won the championship flag donated by Standard Sports Company. The two sides played very well. The Guanghua girls were very coordinated, and they had a good foundation in setting, spiking, blocking, and serving. Unfortunately, the Daxia girls were too nervous. If they had more experience, their strength would be even more impressive. The lineups of the two schools are listed below:</p>

<p>丨Shenbao and Xinwenbao Have a Bye丨</p>
<p>The inter-departmental football match between the four newspapers of Shanghai, Shen Xin Shishi Chen, opened on the 11th of this month at the stadium. Under the heat of the competition, the normally refined gentlemen suddenly turned into brave armed comrades, with an indescribable expression that amused the specialists and scared the women and children. Sports enthusiasts regarded it as a strange tale, and the news media hailed it as an innovation. The Shibao and Minbao of this city have also joined the battle, having completed their organization. The representatives of the newspaper inter-departmental football committee, Jiang Xiangqing of Shishi Xinbao, Fei Shunyuan of Xinwenbao, Qu Yue of Chenbao, and Sun Daosheng of Shenbao, held a special meeting the night before last. Jiang Zongdao and Zhang Shengzhi, representatives of Shibao, also attended and explained the situation. The committee members of each newspaper unanimously welcomed the participation of Shibao and Minbao and requested Jiang Xiangqing to reorder the competition schedule, and Sun Daosheng to contact the venue and referees. From now on, under the unified action of the editorial departments of the major daily newspapers in Shanghai, the spirit of martial arts is promoted, and the weak and scholarly image of students is eradicated. Today at 4 PM, Chenbao will play against Shibao, and at 5 PM, Shishi will play against Minbao. The mysteries of the performances of the Chenbao and Shishi teams have already been appreciated. The unique styles of Shibao and Minbao are currently kept secret. Fortunately, the competition is for fun and not for victory or defeat.</p>

<p>Those who rushed in previously yesterday sold off one after another</p>
<p>The gold market experienced a sharp rise the day before yesterday, but failed to break through the 1,000 mark, causing uncertainty. Unexpectedly, yesterday morning, the forward US dollar rose by more than one cent, and those who entered the market the day before yesterday sold off one after another. The gross price immediately dropped to 82.3 yuan. Major players such as Qian Changxiang, Chunyuan, Yonghong, Lifu, and Changchang, as well as Qingfa, Yongchang Sheng, Yongdai, and a certain Mr. Wu, all sold off, causing further downstream pressure. After opening, the price rose and fell with the exchange rate. The domestic price once tightened, and the gold price was once hyped up to 83.5 yuan. However, Ruixing, acting for Joe Chivu, sold aggressively, and Fuchang and others also sold off fiercely, resulting in a decline. However, in comparison, the bulls were still more advantageous. The revealed price for today is slightly distant, so there is a lack of bulls in the swap market. The price for this month is 60 yuan higher, and the swap price for June and July is 13 yuan lower, which may be due to bookkeeping. There were no special changes in half a day, and the market situation was the opposite of the day before yesterday. The industry suddenly sold US dollars, and there were still many bidders for future delivery, so the process was still smooth. Here is a record of the market situation for the first half of the day.</p>
<p>The morning opening was 976.5 yuan, which was 12 yuan lower than the previous close. The price of goods opened at the same price. The exchange market opened with the British exchange rate at 1 shilling 2 pence 6875, and the US exchange rate at 24.0625 yuan. At first, the market was still stable. After hovering, Tongfeng, Hengbingxing, and Hengyu all took delivery. Fuchang, Yuansheng, and Yong also entered. Although it was able to rise, it was because Huabi was eating US dollars for June at 0625, and half a yuan for August as well. It rose to 80 yuan. Ruixing, Hengyu, Daxing, and Yong all sold, and the trend was still low. HSBC stuffed out US dollars for August at 4375. Before long, Bingxing suddenly sold off US dollars for September at 6875, and the price fell to 74.8 yuan. Pan Gen ate 75 for September, and the market stabilized. After entering the market, all the banks wanted this price. Qingfa, Yong, Fuchang, and Fuyu all entered, and it rose to 9.4 yuan. The HSBC listing rose 25 for British currency and 125 for US currency. At this time, the market hovered around 8 yuan. HSBC continuously ate US dollars for June at 125. Fuchang, Bingxing, Zhifeng, Yongheng, Yuchangyu, and others all entered the market together. Huabi also grabbed US dollars for August at 5625, and it rose to over 82 yuan. After entering the market, the domestic price once tightened. US dollars for August at 4375 were wanted by all the banks. Shunli came up to buy. It was once hyped up to 83.5 yuan. Zhifeng, Yongzhaofengchang took the opportunity to sell, but because Mitsui was grabbing US dollars for August at 375, it was still able to stand at around 2 yuan. However, with a large number of sellers, the trend was still downward. Datong sold half a yuan for August to Huabi. Ruixing, Fuchang, and Zhaofengchang all sold, and it retreated to within 80 yuan. Yuanxingyong also came on the scene to sell, and it retreated further to within 7 yuan. Fuchang, Ruixing, Dafa, and Yong repeatedly sold aggressively, and it dropped to 5.5 yuan. The price of goods was picked up, pulling up by more than 2 yuan. However, with the exchange market hardening, US dollars for August at 5625 were difficult to sell again, and it retreated to 5 yuan. Huabi ate 5625 for August. Hengyu, Yuanmao, and Yong entered at 8.6 yuan. Shunli aggressively sold, and it was 5.1 yuan. Before long, the noon closing was 976.8 yuan, and the price of goods was the same. It was found that the highest price in the half-day was 983.5 yuan, and the lowest price was 974.8 yuan, with a fluctuation of 8.7 yuan. As a result, it fell back 11.7 yuan compared to the previous close.</p>
<p>The revealed price was calculated at 23.625 yuan due to HSBC's US dollar listing rising by 125, totaling 1,015.87 yuan. Based on the closing price, it was about 39 yuan lower, which was 6 yuan more than the previous close. The price for registration this month was 1,009 yuan, 989 yuan for June, and 977 yuan for July. The afternoon subsidy was 1,009 yuan. The price for this month was calculated to be 60 yuan higher, but there were no formal transactions. There were still few swap deals, because the revealed price was far away, resulting in a lack of long positions. (The price of goods for May and June was over 21.5 yuan). For June and July, Tongfenheng offered to subsidize Qian Changxiang 5,516 lots, with a subsidy of 13 yuan, which may be a bookkeeping transaction. The bidding price in the market was generally 14 or 15 yuan. There were still 2,492 lots left for May, and 7,651 lots for June. The short positions were Tongfenheng Shenkang Hengyu Daxingyong Hengxing, and the long positions were Qian Changxiang Runchangyong Dadecheng, etc.</p>
<p>The market transaction changed to oversupply. In summary, Ruixing (acting for Joe Chivu), Fuchang, Zhaofengchang, Yuanxingyong, Dafa Yongshunli, etc. all sold. Tongfenheng Hengxing Fuyu Runchangyu Wanxing Hengyu, etc. all entered. In the gross market, Qian Changxiang Chunyuan Yonghong Lifu Changchang Shengyong Qingfa Yong (heard acting for a certain Mr. Wu) all sold. Bingxing Zhifengyong first entered and then exited. The Dalian gang Wanxing entered more than 200. Shunli exited. The Guangdong gang had little entry or exit. For the July lots, the short positions were Qian Changxiang with more than 4,600, Dadecheng with more than 2,600, Hengyu with more than 900, and Fuyu with more than 500. The long positions were Tongfenheng with more than 4,000, Shunli Qingfa Yongyuanheng Wanxing with more than 1,000 each, and Daxingyong with more than 600. In summary, there were 15,729 lots.</p>

<h3 id="e246">Subsidiary Coins Turn Stable After Falling <a href="#e246" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c246" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">246</a></h3>

<h3 id="e247">Securities and Public Bonds Continue to Show Strong and Stable State <a href="#e247" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c247" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">247</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market of the Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange was still quite strong and stable. The situation in North China, Tianjin and Beijing, was at a very dangerous time. At the same time, the voice of peace became more and more intense. At this critical moment of survival, it was either imminent demise or a sharp turn for the better. There was no third way. If the market tries to maintain the status quo by chance, it will be difficult to establish itself. Therefore, the atmosphere in the market became more solemn. The risk for short sellers was the lack of goods, and the danger for long sellers was the lack of funds. When weighing the advantages and disadvantages, the market psychology was that long sellers had more ways to deal with the situation. Therefore, when the new news came the day before yesterday, the North Gang short sellers immediately cut their losses painfully in order to avoid the disaster of being squeezed when the delivery was approaching. Therefore, yesterday's market price did not cause a reverse wind due to the surge the day before yesterday. Although the long sellers of No. 55 came out, the incoming stomach of No. 46 was also very strong. The buying and selling of each gang was also evenly matched. The market observation in the morning was slightly chaotic, with both rises and falls. The afternoon market turned to the upside, which could be seen as the trend of people's hearts. The rising momentum was stronger at the close. The futures trading in May will last until the 23rd, which is already approaching. The style of mutual squeezing between long and short sellers is not far away. As a result, except for the disarmament and the principal of the 19th Goodness, which fell by 1.5 to 2.5 corners this month, and the long-term dismissed personnel, which fell by 1 corner, the rest all continued to rise by 1 to 5 corners. Trading was mostly done by swaps. The total transaction volume was 9,752,000 yuan, including 2,000 yuan in spot goods. Futures unified salt tax accounted for more than 4.4 million, disarmament accounted for more than 1.8 million, 19 Guan Shan accounted for more than 1.5 million, 20 volumes and 20 Guan also accounted for more than 1.5 million, dismissal accounted for 300,000, and the whole six and nine six accounted for only 50,000.</p>

<p>New Feng Foreign Firm reported that on Monday (16th), the New York stock market rose by 1 to 5 yuan due to President Roosevelt's speech to all countries in the world, including various stocks such as sugar, meat, and "wet" stocks. The unusual strength of American Steel and American Telephone and Telegraph proved the return of investment buying. The dividend of American Telephone and Telegraph is expected to be issued as usual, so the short sellers of the stock are making up for it. The total daily turnover was 3.2 million shares. The Dow Jones index is listed on the left,</p>

<p>The yarn market is very strong and the rising momentum is fierce. This is because the factories are said to be united to do more long. At the same time, the actual need for South China to initiate procurement has made people's hearts tighter. However, other gangs have not had a large amount of activity. Rumors are rife in the business community. The general madmen say that there is hope for peace between China and Japan, and that the yarn market will have a big rise in the future. More buyers are in the market. The futures market transaction is quite prosperous. The market price rises and falls more and more.</p>

<p>The cotton market is also rising fiercely. However, the overseas cotton market is calm. People in this port are extremely bullish. This is because the bottom goods are thin, the sources of each road are declining, and there are more and more new long sellers. However, one major player has turned from long to short. At present, most of the business community is bullish. The future must depend on the rise and fall of foreign cotton.</p>

<p>(Sheng County) Farmers in the north and south cities and villages are unable to raise silkworms this year, and they all borrow money to buy seeds. Most of them raise foreign species. In villages such as Sanjie, Chongren, Ganlin, Houshan, and Huatang, the amount of feeding is relatively smooth. The weather is mild, and there are instructors running around to guide them. The silkworm ants are developing healthily, and the early gangs have entered the big sleep. However, in the Qingshuitang Ma'ao Shangjiang Rencun area, some people still raise native species, which are now flourishing with leaves. However, due to continuous thunderstorms and strong winds, the silkworm farmers cannot dry the leaves in time, causing the native silkworms to develop diseases such as yellow leakage. The foreign silkworms are also sluggish in eating leaves and have uneven sleep heads due to sudden cold and heat. The instructors are running around to rescue them and are trying to isolate them to avoid infection.</p>
<p>(Yangzhong) The farmers in the four villages are all raising foreign species this year, borrowing money. Some people hatch native species due to lack of borrowing channels, resulting in inconsistent silkworm flood times. The early native silkworms have now been sleeping three times and have enough leaves. The foreign silkworms are sleeping three times and releasing leaves. The silkworm ants are developing well. Unexpectedly, there have been repeated thunderstorms, strong winds, rain, and hail in the past two days. The native early silkworms in the coastal sands have changed, and they have abdominal diarrhea due to eating rain leaves, and they have white zombie disease due to uneven cold and heat. Foreign silkworms are also delaying sleep and eating leaves slowly. Silkworm farmers are all holding hidden worries. The supply of mulberry leaves exceeds the demand, and there is still no market price.</p>
<h3 id="e257">Zhenmei Green Tea Transactions Continue to Be Strong <a href="#e257" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c257" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">257</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Zhenmei green tea from Wenzhou and Tuzhuang in this port continued to be strong in transactions. A total of more than 590 boxes were traded throughout the city. The top plate of Zhenmei opened at 151 yuan, and the needle eyebrows opened at 10 yuan, with no rise or fall compared to the previous day. However, each manufacturer is mostly waiting and seeing due to the lack of profit. The number of Tuzhuang tea has been greatly reduced. As for Wenzhou green tea, more than 1,300 boxes arrived yesterday, and the innkeepers will soon be arranging samples.</p>
<p>A Look at the Qifu Tea Market</p>
<h3 id="e258">New Tea Production with Tender Heads <a href="#e258" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c258" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">258</a></h3>
<p>The new black tea from the four villages of Qifu has been opened by mountain households for picking and drying for more than ten days. However, due to the cold weather, the tea body cannot be enlarged in order, and the leaf quality is very tender. According to tea masters, this year's tea leaves are produced thinly and tenderly. Most of those who pick and make them on sunny days have excellent color, aroma, and taste. However, the output is less than last year because the tea is tender and cannot be picked out.</p>
<h3 id="e259">Tea Households Feel Pain from Low Prices <a href="#e259" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c259" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">259</a></h3>
<p>This year, the Qifu tea houses suffered a major loss last year, and the prices to the mountains were uniformly lowered. The top character high village goods in Qixi only sold for 65 or 66 yuan, and the Qicheng and Nanlu tea only sold for 54 or 55 yuan, a drop of 40 or 50 yuan per dan compared to 120 or 130 yuan for Qixi goods last year and 80 or 90 yuan for Qinan goods. The household's annual cost of living, which relies on tea prices, has been reduced by half this year. The half price they get, after deducting labor, food, and miscellaneous expenses, is very little left. This year, the Qifu tea households have suffered another disaster.</p>
<h3 id="e260">Tea Warehouses Carefully Release Exchanges <a href="#e260" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c260" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">260</a></h3>
<p>This year, the warehouse owners are afraid of the discount of the Qishang last year, and the scope of the release of funds has been greatly reduced. They visually inspect the credit of the owners of the company. Each company is limited to releasing up to 4,000. As of now, the tea silver released by each warehouse is only 800,000 yuan in total, which is 2.2 million yuan less than last year. Considering the interests of the warehouse owners themselves, this tightening policy also shows the necessary steps to know the danger.</p>
<h3 id="e261">Tea Number Decreases by Ninety-Five <a href="#e261" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c261" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">261</a></h3>
<p>This year, the original numbers were hit by the low tea market last year. Most of the capital was lost, and new sources of funds were not comfortable. Although the tea warehouses have a relief of 4,000 loans, the amount is minimal. According to the latest survey, there are only 259 tea numbers in the three counties of Qifu, which is a decrease of 95 compared to last year. Moreover, they are all short of capital and cannot expand as widely as in previous years, and import as much tea as possible.</p>
<h3 id="e262">The Cost of New Tea is Not Light <a href="#e262" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c262" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">262</a></h3>
<p>In recent years, the price of Qifu tea has continued to rise. The tea merchants have no standards and have been fighting to raise the price. This year's cost is still not light. According to the top-character raw tea bought by each number, the price is 60 yuan per dan. The cost of making finished boxes is about 200 yuan. The cost of purchasing Qinggong tea at a price of 200 yuan per tael, and making one catty of dry tea from three catties, is about 300 yuan per dan. Judging from the current tea market in Shanghai, the stored red is priced from 80 taels to 30 taels per dan. Then the new tea, which requires 200 to 300 yuan per dan, cannot avoid loss again.</p>

<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, arrivals were forty to fifty numbers, departures remained sluggish, market conditions continued to weaken. Northern and Southern ocean groups, such as Beiping Xinghua, purchased a little over a thousand packages of Bo Dao rice, the situation was quiet and desolate. Therefore, Su Tong group, Chang group and Nangang Qingjiao, Songjiang Sifeng, Xilian and other rice, market prices decreased by one or two jiao or so. Du Yangjian also showed signs of weakening by a jiao or so. Those changing to silver dollars in order to match the times could still maintain their position. (North Shanghai) Yesterday, twenty-seven or eight ships arrived from various groups downstream. White geng rice going to Huadian stores was still slow-moving, medium and lower grade goods lacked transactions, leading to another decline in the market by two or three jiao. Arrivals of early Bo Dao rice continued, sales were not smooth, and the price was slightly lower by one or two chi. Yangjian Du Bujjian and other types were also slightly lower by a chi or so. Kejian lacked transactions, silver dollars down by two jiao, while exchange rates were raised several times.</p>
<h3 id="e265">Foreign Rice, Guest Rice Transactions Very Active <a href="#e265" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c265" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">265</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, guest rice transactions were very active, and foreign rice also sold three thousand packages. Guest Xian rice and rough Xian rice totaled five thousand packages. The market was lively. Although the weather was hot and owners were eager to sell, the market remained quite firm. Three hundred packages of high quality foreign rice from Wenzhou went for seven yuan and two jiao. Two hundred packages of smaller sized grain went from this street. Two thousand five hundred packages were distributed to Fujian and Yongzhou, with high quality small-sized grain at seven yuan, five jiao, seven fen to three fen. Medium-grade goods were at seven yuan, four jiao and a half. Guest Xian rice was mostly rough. With the exception of three hundred and sixty packages from Shaoxing to Hunan, all was handled by the Fuzhou group, the market was stable and the prices were similar to the previous market.</p>
<p>[P Flour Greatly Falls, Then Slightly Rebounds&gt;</p>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market presented an initial image of stability, followed by a solid one, due to the quotation for foreign wheat being down again by one or two jiao or so. Therefore, the market atmosphere after opening was average. However, after several days of drastic declines, the general number of amateur sellers had decreased. Various factories were also mostly taking a wait-and-see attitude due to the uncertain trend of the current situation. Therefore, the degree of decline in each month was only smaller by about five li to one fen compared to the previous day. By the time the market opened in the afternoon, the market atmosphere in each month was slightly more stable. Rumors in the market were that the situation in the north had eased, so buying interest was slightly better, slightly higher than in the morning. However, the attitude of the Tianjin group was still dim. The entire city was still successively issuing files, so this market trend may be a large fall followed by a small rebound. As a result, this month was unchanged, June and July were up by five li, August was down by two and a half li, September was up by two and a half li, and October was up by five li.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the futures wheat market once again showed a consistent trend of plunging. The price of foreign wheat was down again by one or two jiao or so, and the weather was sunny during the day and rainy at night, greatly comforting people. In addition, the assessments of new wheat in various production areas were all better than last year. The opening price of each month in the morning immediately fell by four to five fen or so. By the time the market opened in the afternoon, the decline had stabilized somewhat. However, at the time of opening, new low prices were seen. July fell to four yuan, one jiao and two fen, August to four yuan, two jiao, and September to four yuan, three jiao and two fen. The Zhenjiang and other groups were quite active in issuing files. Later, because the flour market turned stable, people's minds also improved slightly. As a result, July fell another five fen compared to the previous day, August fell five fen, September fell six fen, and October fell six fen in the morning, but it did not open in the afternoon.</p>

<p>The departure route for bean cakes depends on the observation of the export groups. It only relies on the activity in the mainland, and the market atmosphere is not easy to progress. Moreover, it is dumped by guest cakes, which greatly affects factory cakes. Therefore, cargo owners of cart beans intend to sell, and are killed cheap by factories. Yu Shi Doudou and Sha Huang are also average. Moreover, the selling price of high-quality goods is even more disadvantageous than medium-grade goods. Therefore, the bean market situation is still temporarily looking at a weary situation.</p>

<p>Virtuous Mothers and Good Wives versus Glamorous Mothers and Bright Wives</p>
<p>The most dangerous great man is undoubtedly Gandhi; does China have a great man like Gandhi? No. China's great men are proponents of suffering, not Gandhians. I remember a certain great man saying, "A miserable Chinese person," which was simply lamenting the suffering of the Chinese people, advocating a kind of suffering. However, if everyone embraces suffering, there is a possibility of hardship turning into happiness. Unfortunately, in war-torn areas, everyone embraces suffering; in places of ease, everyone embraces hedonism. The suffering suffer, and the joyful rejoice, which is why such a phenomenon arises.</p>
<p>Eastern women's education has not escaped the virtuous mother and good wife doctrine; some say that the virtuous mother and good wife doctrine is a form of slavery. Our Chinese women's education surpasses this doctrine, focusing not only on the four characters of virtuous mother and good wife. However, recent women's education often neglects virtuous mothers and good wives, focusing instead on glamorous mothers and bright wives, which sound similar but have different meanings. Clearly having become a mother, the child is handed over to a nanny to manage, while the mother dresses brightly and goes to the dance floor, which is the glamorous mother doctrine. Clearly having become a housewife, she manages nothing, focusing only on beauty; clothing, food, housing, and transportation are all about beauty. She only hopes that people will praise her as a "beautiful lady," which brings her more satisfaction than being called a "greatly virtuous lady," which is called the bright wife doctrine.</p>
<h3 id="e274">Rendering Them Incapable of Bearing Children <a href="#e274" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c274" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">274</a></h3>
<p>— Lily</p>
<p>A few days ago, all the newspapers published "news" from Germany stating that, in order to improve the race, the National Socialist Party would enact new laws to render criminals and those who are physically or mentally unsound incapable of bearing children.</p>
<p>As for what "incapable of bearing children" actually means, the telegram was too brief, and we are not able to guess. I imagine there will be an explanation next time.</p>
<p>In the houses of our country's emperors, the thirty-six palaces and seventy-two courtyards housed countless "imperial concubines" who "never had the emperor's favor in their lives." Therefore, all male servants on duty in the palace had their "things" cut off to prevent dry firewood from meeting a raging fire. These "disempowered" friends are called eunuchs. I don't know if Germany wants to "render them incapable of bearing children" by adopting this foolproof, humane, and fundamentally resolving "castration" method.</p>
<p>I really don't know if it's a coincidence, or if the Germans are imitating Eastern civilization. Because in Chinese history, there was a lowly historian who wrote good articles, but angered an unprogressive emperor who loved flattery and hated criticism, who, like the Germans, "rendered him incapable of bearing children," to prevent the "dragons begetting dragons, phoenixes begetting phoenixes, and thieves raising sons to dig holes in the walls" from passing on an unambiguous little Sima Qian to stir things up.</p>
<p>If this law is ever implemented, then prisoners released from prison and patients in hospitals will each be "doomed." From then on, in Berlin, "eunuchs will walk the streets," which is good for wanting children. From then on, "sitting still without being tempted" cannot be monopolized by Liu Xiahui.</p>
<p>Food and sex are human nature. Women and bread are equally important in life. Everyone is afraid of this move, so they are cautious and dare not engage in activities that violate criminal law or harm health. This is the great principle of improving the race. To put it plainly, for example, "spitting anywhere" and "urinating anywhere" will "render them incapable of bearing children," then who would dare to "spit anywhere" or "urinate anywhere"? Who would associate "Chinese people" with "dogs"?</p>
<p>Some are worried that China will follow suit. I say, rest assured, China already has people planning to solve the sexual desires of prisoners.</p>

<p>Here, there is no clean, harmonious air, only a chaotic, terrifying, and stimulating din. When the Jianghai Customs clock strikes nine, this dry market begins to fill with emaciated figures dressed in tattered clothes and shoes. But there are also a few big shots who have not yet been drained of blood, standing like Buddhas, stretching out their arms, gesturing, and shouting: "Buy in at × yuan, sell out at × yuan."</p>
<p>The red lights reporting market prices rotate like a revolving lantern, and the customers sitting on high stools follow the red lights with their big pupils. Their faces constantly display strange expressions of joy, anger, sorrow, and happiness. If they were filmed at that time, it would be a giant comedy. 丨丨Big news, silver prices soar. 丨丨Draft, the shilling fluctuates. 丨丨Large holders of long positions emerge. 丨丨People's hearts are down, and standard gold plunges.

<p>Chapter Seven: Severing Affection with a Few Words and Weeping Behind Closed Doors; Shouldering Righteousness and Discussing Over Wine</p>
<p>Gan Jizhi and the old maiden of the Yang family thought that this secret meeting in the milk tea shop was very safe, but unexpectedly, they ran into his elder brother Houzhi. Needless to say, the words he and the old maiden said were completely heard by his brother. Undoubtedly, his brother would definitely give him a big lesson. It's just that listening to this kind of lesson in a coffee shop, along with a group of onlookers, would make people laugh, and it would be embarrassing. For this reason, it was best to slip away, and when he got home, he would let his brother scold him as much as he wanted. Thinking this way, he didn't care what his brother looked like, rushed to pay for the refreshments at the milk tea shop, lowered his head, and went home. When he got home, he slipped into the study, his heart still pounding. He thought to himself that he must not let his brother get too angry, and when his brother said something, he would admit his mistake. He sat listlessly at the table, holding his head in his hands, just thinking about how to calm his brother's anger, what his brother would say, and how he would admit his mistake? He was thinking like this. His mind was like fifteen buckets drawing water, fluctuating up and down, but Gan Houzhi did not regard this matter as an urgent official document, and did not return home until after nine o'clock in the evening. Jizhi was waiting for his brother's rebuke and hadn't slept yet. However, Houzhi returned to the main room and went directly to talk to his sister-in-law, and did not pay attention to this matter. Jizhi thought that his brother probably thought that they were both upright men and it was inconvenient to embarrass him too much, thinking that he had already decided not to say anything. This relieved him of some worries and he fell asleep peacefully. When he got up the next day, he still went to work as usual, feeling deeply lucky, thinking that he had already passed this difficult hurdle. However, a problem occurred when he came back this afternoon. The maid said that the lady wanted to talk to the second master in the main room. Hearing this, Jizhi knew that there was a reason and his heart pounded again. Madam Gan was sitting on a chair in the main room, holding a cigarette in her mouth, her mood very calm. Seeing Jizhi coming in, she smiled slightly at him. Jizhi stood at the door and said: "Sister-in-law, did you call me for something?" Madam Gan pointed to a chair opposite and said: "Sit down and talk slowly. What are you busy with?" (73)</p>

<p>Waiting, waiting. Several men at the bus stop, chewing cigars, looking at the advertisements in the newspapers: pacing leisurely, their attitude so idle and silent.</p>
<p>Two high-heeled leather shoes moved towards this side, and the bus stop was immediately like a flower bomb exploding. The elderly gentleman pulled at his collar, feeling uneasy as if he had a fever. The myopic Mr. Spectacles was looking at people with his forehead, while the one with the cane was desperately digging the ground.</p>
<p>Following, following, like food being loaded into a stall, I was stuffed into the public bus.</p>
<p>The young gentlemen sitting in the row of seats reserved for women, their attitude as solemn as if they were going to the office, but their eyes were secretly peeking at the bodies of those sitting next to them, as slippery as a thief.</p>
<p>Spitting out a few people, and swallowing a few more, the bus passed another stop. At the entrance and exit, a Chinese man in a blue cloth robe was stepped on his cloth-shoe foot by a well-dressed, high-class Chinese, and cried out in pain. It was so ungraceful that this high-class Chinese was startled, turned his head and gave him a hateful glare, and strode into the carriage.</p>
<p>A vase sat comfortably in the open seat at the rear of the bus, vibrating sharply and rhythmically with the sound of the bus. The vase's whole body was cramping, revealing some secrets of youth on its face.</p>
<p>A middle-aged man in a suit was spitting hard against the glass window; a foreign woman sitting to the right of the same row of seats quickly turned her head to the right, frowning, showing an ugly, contemptuous expression, as if she were saying to everyone in the car: "How annoying and dirty are the Chinese people with lung disease!"</p>

<p>Because I went to visit the University of Paris, a friend talked to me about the life of Chinese students. 丨丨I have mentioned it in the previous article, but not in detail丨丨China has greatly reduced its faith in overseas students recently. In the past, hearing that someone was an overseas student was like seeing a Westerner, and they were treated with respect. If they were said to be a foreign doctor, then twelve thousand points of admiration were added to the respect. Now, we are used to seeing overseas students, and it is still the same thing. The only difference is that they have eaten bread for a few years, or learned a little Western style. Otherwise, a rice bucket is still a rice bucket, and they are not necessarily better than domestic students. As for doctors, that is naturally another case of selling dog meat with a sheep's head. Some so-called doctors are often not as good as those without doctorates, so everyone is even less trusting of overseas students. However, we must first understand that overseas students are not some sacred thing. Overseas students are originally not as respected in other countries as they are in China. They are really very respected, and the reason for the respect is that their country does not easily let a student go to another country. That is, they must learn something and come back. (Their thoughts also have great differences) In addition, the economic and cultural conditions of various countries are different, which are naturally very different from China. As for China, to put it simply, the country has not thought about what overseas students will learn abroad to help China (you can tell from the fact that the diplomatic organs do not pay attention to the lives of overseas students), and the so-called overseas students are not all trying to get something by studying abroad. We can see this from the following classification of overseas students:</p>
<p>(1) Studying abroad for knowledge. The so-called knowledge includes everything, such as industry, culture, etc. This type of student generally accounts for the least number. Regarding their economy, some are completely poor. Some have very little funding.</p>
<p>(2) Studying abroad to retire. The so-called retirement should refer to big shots, but some small officials, after being politically defeated, cleverly scraped together some money and used studying abroad as an excuse to study abroad.</p>
<p>(3) Studying abroad for fun. There are many such people, such as some of those mentioned above who are studying abroad to retire. China is not short of children of bureaucrats or gentry, who feel that China is not fun, so they also come under the name of studying abroad.</p>
<p>(4) Studying abroad for fame. Such people generally admire overseas students themselves. They think that if they have money, they should also go abroad and come back with the sign of an overseas student.</p>
<p>(5) Studying abroad for no apparent reason. These people generally have not graduated from middle school, and they follow others to study abroad because others say so.</p>
<p>(6) Overseas students sent by the government. Most of these overseas students have been masters, and they are no longer completely students in thought and life. However, they come to foreign countries to experience the life of overseas students.</p>
<p>As for other reasons, there are many more. But we simply examine how many of these complex overseas students are actually studying? And if those overseas students who did not come to study return to do foolish things, can you not blame the overseas students for being bad? But you know that there are so many overseas students, 丨丨who can stop anyone from studying abroad if they have money丨丨You can also understand everything. Therefore, those who scold overseas students in China should understand this reason, and at the same time, please do not worship, whether they are doctors or not, Chinese students or foreign students, if they have no ability, just treat them the same!</p>

<h3 id="e280">Universal Remedy <a href="#e280" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c280" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">280</a></h3>
<p>— Tianfang</p>
<p>When you get sick, you must take medicine. This is probably an unchanging principle in ancient and modern times, both in China and abroad. Although things like colds do not necessarily require medication and can heal on their own, if the symptoms are a little more serious, or if you don't want to be bedridden for a long time, it is always advisable to take medicine, which even not very smart people can understand.</p>
<p>The difficulty arises when it comes to taking medicine. How many diseases are there in the world? You have to ask a doctor of medicine about this, but I am not a medical student, so I don't know the details. But since the Tang Dynasty, there have been more than 5,300 "Golden Prescriptions." If each prescription is only for treating one disease, then just in terms of "national diseases," there are at least half a million. Other diseases imported from foreign countries, such as "yellow fever" and "black death," are not included. The problem arises here: there are so many diseases, and I think even doctors may not be able to remember them completely clearly, so prescribing the right medicine is a bit of a hassle. And people like Bian Que and Hua Tuo are rarely seen these days, and news of quack doctors killing people is often seen in newspapers. It really makes sick people quite hesitant. Moreover, humans in the 20th century are used to living at high speeds, and who would bother to carefully examine and slowly treat? Therefore, a simple treatment method, 丨丨the invention of a universal remedy, is imminent. If the drugs for typhoid fever to venom, etc., can be steamed, distilled, squeezed, and fused into one dose according to the "sovereign, minister, assistant, and envoy" principles, like a palindrome poem, viewed horizontally or sideways, all can be used wonderfully. Even if there are tens of thousands of diseases, there is only one prescription, wouldn't it be a two-way benefit for the patient, the doctor, and the pharmacy? 丨丨Perhaps at that time, producers, 丨丨pharmacies, and consumers, 丨丨patients, will be able to trade directly, and doctors will not be needed, which is something that famous doctors of ancient times, such as Hua Tuo, did not expect.</p>
<p>The 20th century is said to be the era of Asia, so the honor of this invention falls on the Second Model Prison of Caohejing, Shanghai, Jiangsu Province, China. Because it is a "model," it houses a particularly large number of prisoners, accommodating more than 1,700 people. Recently, because it is not enough, they are discussing building a new prison.</p>
<p>Although prisoners have lost their physical freedom, their freedom to get sick has not been taken away along with it. 丨丨On the contrary, inside the iron windows, it is more suitable for getting sick. Most of the heroic young people, arrested for fighting with their iron fists, are haggard when they have the opportunity to come out of the iron gate. Although many of them are skilled in martial arts, they all seem to suffer from anemia. Time really makes people old. According to a friend who has lived there, living in a house like a fly cage, crowded and unable to breathe, is not as good as the bears and tigers in the zoo who occupy a single cage. 丨丨These words may be a bit激, but the facts are not entirely true. The polar bears and Bengal tigers in the zoo, wandering in the iron fence all day long, also seem to have no intention of growing old in this place, but from the perspective of people living in fly cages, it is a bit more comfortable.</p>
<p>The more people in prison, the more sickness increases accordingly. Because there are too many patients, this "universal remedy" was invented under scientific management. According to reports, the name of the new prescription is: "Public Prescription." The name is "public," and the footnote below is probably "everyone can take it." It seems a bit novel to say, but it is not really novel. For example, rich old masters and mistresses should take ginseng, velvet antler, and bird's nest, and young and playful men and women should use "606" and "Her Friend." Prisoners belong to another group of people丨丨Although the reasons for committing crimes are not necessarily the same, under the "common name" of "prisoner," they should naturally take the same medicine. The ingredients of the prescription are unknown, but the prison doctor's hard work is admirable. It is truly a new discovery in the medical field and a great success in scientific management. From then on, it can be simplified and efficient, and it can be done once and for all, and the reward for the medical officer is not small.</p>
<p>But what I want to say is more than this. In this era when the rationalization movement has swept the world, the "universal remedy" in politics seems to be used earlier and more widely. Isn't the soul of Blackshirt leader Mussolini flying from Italy to Germany, to Japan, and to other countries! The humans of the 20th century are smart, and it is even more gratifying that the Chinese are not lagging behind!</p>
<h3 id="e281">The Decline of Peking Opera <a href="#e281" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c281" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">281</a></h3>
<p>— Xian</p>
<p>Speaking of Peking Opera, the image of Ryunosuke Akutagawa's "Shanghai Travelogue" immediately pops into my head. He spoke so cheekily. It wasn't because he was our enemy that I already disliked this writer at the time. However, I myself had never stepped through the doors of such theaters, and Peking Opera was foreign to me. I doubted whether the price of one yuan (ordinary) was worth it, and I resented Akutagawa's cheeky remarks in my mind.</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, my uncle came from the countryside and dragged me to accompany him to watch Peking Opera, and I finally obtained my "worth." Of course, I didn't spend that much, but that writer's words were confirmed, although he was a bit too harsh.</p>
<p>Peking Opera has declined, the golden age of "Hong Bi Yuan" and "The Case of the Swapped Crown Prince" is over. A large number of the petty bourgeoisie are intoxicated by the anesthetic of Hollywood. Only when Mei Lanfang, with a doctorate from abroad, comes to Shanghai do the ladies spend money to see this Xiao old man, who claims to have the secret to longevity, dressed as a woman.</p>
<p>I originally doubted that Peking Opera, which foreign gentlemen considered to have artistic meaning, was so depressed in its own country. Is the appreciation ability of foreign gentlemen really so lacking? Their own art—movies—is also heading towards suicide, with sensuality, beast films, air battles, and even gods and monsters, always the same old tired tricks. Without seeking self-improvement, they are accustomed to using speculative methods to cater to low-level interests. How few do not fail!</p>
<p>All the old rules of the Peking Opera world are as unchangeable as the Pamir Mountains. At the entrance stands a "Ah! Two gentlemen!"—the loud voice of the usher. I wonder if Mei Lanfang used this kind of attracting method when performing abroad? We stepped through that self-closing door like visiting guests in the old days. Before eight o'clock, on the corner of the advertising curtain, a group of people were sweating and playing the overture. They were working so hard that an old lady covered her ears and said, "It's giving me a headache!" My head only ached faintly; young people still have this advantage.</p>
<p>On the seats in the first ten rows, the program for today's performance was laid out, and four high-legged pots were arranged in a group, indicating that they had been reserved by the ladies of the consulate(?). We also discounted our one-hundred-point "foreign" value, but I also admitted that my nearsightedness and the old lady's headache were self-inflicted. Can't you cheer from the third floor?</p>
<p>The curtain rises.</p>
<p>This is the Qing Dynasty—I write "Qing Dynasty" directly. I wonder if the Puyi government agrees?—a story of an imperial envoy, which can be endlessly performed like "The Case of the Swapped Crown Prince."</p>
<p>Plot: A lecherous monk picks flowers, a young master falls into misfortune. There is an imperial envoy dressed in the style of the Song Dynasty, a person wearing glasses dressed in Napoleon's attire, Shanghai dialect, Suzhou dialect, and also pidgin English. Interspersed within are battle scenes advocating martial spirit during times of national crisis. Instead of red faces and white faces, there are airplanes and big</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>cannons; as for "dancing" that can "save the country," it is also "all-inclusive." A great masterpiece of 1933, combining slapstick, romance, sensuality, glamour, and war in one pot!</p>
<p>Children clap their hands and say, "It's so good!" The old lady with a headache shakes her head; I didn't ask if the headache was because it wasn't good or not. A girl with red lips said娇声 to a gentleman in a suit, "That dog is so well-behaved, even more so than you!" and poked his nose with her red onion finger painted with rouge.</p>
<p>This is an undeniable fact: that dog is indeed more well-behaved than "people." From their criticism of the dog, it can be known that many people are not watching the play.</p>
<p>Peking Opera has declined. Strive to improve! Since real dogs on stage have produced "human" results, quickly replace the horse whip in "Si Lang Visits His Mother" with a mount.</p>
<p>My head still aches faintly, so I won't say much. This is a free advertisement. Those who want to see the dog perform, might as well spend a "sheep." Come, come, try and see.</p>
<h3 id="e282">Untitled <a href="#e282" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c282" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">282</a></h3>
<p>— Wen</p>
<p>丨Written with feeling for the special newsboys丨</p>
<p>Many men are speaking out on behalf of women, rejoicing greatly, while women themselves don't seem to care that much. Since the eastward spread of European and American customs, the personnel and society of our noble country have undergone sudden changes in details and minor branches. Adding a foreign signboard, the most significant change is probably the change in gender relations. In the past (referring to before Westernization), our female compatriots all lived a secluded life like prisoners. Bearing children and managing the household were their only missions, which pressed them down like蒲垫. Of course, this was somewhat wrong. Now, we can finally say that good fortune has arrived. There are women who are county magistrates, and there are also women who are committee members. Extending this to government agencies, companies, and banks, all have female compatriots standing tall and working in society like men. With this one turn, the relationship between men and women becomes extremely strange and complex. Some agree with this, and some oppose it. Some despise it out of jealousy, and some praise it with cheers and songs. Thus, many new nouns have been added, such as female "vases," "queens," "campus belles," "modern ladies," "women of the times," and at the extreme end, "female heroes," "female hooligans," "prostitutes," "salted pork shops," etc. Although their meanings are different, their source is the same—all of them should be attributed to European and American customs.</p>
<p>In fact, in this era, women are indeed awe-inspiring and unapproachable; and the greatness of their magic is something that everyone knows and can talk about. Therefore, companies and stores cannot help but rely on female receptionists, gatherings and fundraising cannot help but rely on socialites and daughters of prominent families, and seeking jobs and official positions cannot help but</p>
<h3 id="e283">Antiques Are Important <a href="#e283" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c283" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">283</a></h3>
<p>— Ziwei</p>
<p>help but rely on young women and aunts. Even alleviating national crises and saving the country cannot help but rely on feminine beauty. Although it is said that they have not earned social status or human rights,</p>
<p>because of this, the status of men has been lowered invisibly. How many men痴心 bow down under cheongsams and leather shoes, pursuing a woman without exhausting their wealth, and women become more and more precious and awe-inspiring.</p>
<p>Because of this, almost all female compatriots have been stirred up, gradually forming today's雌 world, especially in large cities like Shanghai. The activity of women is truly no less than that of men. In terms of quantity, it is also no less than that of men. On the roads, in amusement parks, in factories... where can you not see them crowded together?</p>
<p>Speaking of turning around, in order to attract male customers, it is necessary to rely on women's玉客. Companies must hire female receptionists, and saving the country requires inviting dancing stars. Now that there are so many active and numerous women in the city, in order to attract female customers, it is indeed necessary to select delicate male receptionists in companies, gatherings, and national salvation venues, especially in洋货 companies and game parks that women love to step into... it is necessary to select them urgently.</p>
<p>A certain theater has seen this first, so it has taken the lead in advocating it. At the entrance of that theater, there are two special delicate newsboy children, about thirteen or fourteen years old, with bright leather shoes, 空 blue serge uniforms and hats, and the hats are inlaid with three bright copper characters of "×× Newspaper." Unlike ordinary snotty newspaper boys, they can make several strangely moving coquettish poses, which cause young mistresses and ladies to slip past their sight, and unconsciously拿 out hundreds of copper coins to buy you a cheap four-coin × Evening News to read. Of course, what woman doesn't love young boys, "beautiful eyes盼兮," even if it's one角钱 a piece, what does it matter! Overall, it is a model for the budding of male receptionists, worthy of publicity.</p>
<p>This is truly a way to revitalize Shanghai's entertainment after the war, and perhaps it is the secret to revitalizing the entire Shanghai business. May those who aspire to this follow suit.</p>
<h3 id="e284">Escape from Annoyance <a href="#e284" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c284" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">284</a></h3>
<p>— Bing</p>
<p>This is indeed a kind of annoyance, which needs to be found a way to escape.</p>
<p>The attic that had been empty for a month suddenly had a young couple move in two weeks ago one evening. We live in the front living room, and the so-called attic is built on top of the back living room. Because it is an attic, all four sides are solid, so there is nowhere to set up windows, so there are no windows. There is only one side facing our room, with small wooden squares nailed into many diagonal square openings, more than a丈 wide, but less than two feet high. The air needed in the attic all relies on our room for transportation. Precisely because it is a通洞 partition like a lattice window, the sound is very communicative, even the slight咕咕 in the throat and the sound of swallowing phlegm can be heard clearly, which also planted the seeds for the origin of the annoyance.</p>
<p>From the mouth of the second landlord, I learned that this young couple had just come from the countryside. Looking at their behavior and decorations, it is believable that they are genuine 内地帮. The man leaves early in the morning and does not return until late at night, so I have never recognized him clearly. The impression is very vague. As for the woman, I can sketch a general outline: a face that seems to have been baked ripe by the sun, smeared with a thick layer of snow cream, looks like a crumpled piece of white wax paper. The unevenly developed figure is clothed in a delicate-looking, seemingly modern cheongsam with a floral green梯, which reveals many凸峰 on the body (forgive me for not praising her for having a curvy beauty). The two full breasts in front of her chest are like two strong sole fish, plus a pair of light green纱袜 on her feet, it can be affirmed that she is already a quasi-urban woman who is intoxicated by modernity, about twenty years old.</p>
<p>However, she is, after all, a来路货 who has suffered hardships. She does not have great extravagances. Although squatting in the attic where she can hardly stand upright, she is still complacent, which is, to some extent, due to the enthusiasm and love of the couple.</p>
<p>The laughter of "Eat, eat, eat," mixed with the lewd sound of翻云覆雨, at least two bouts every night, and we, who were sleeping in the front living room below, were disturbed and unable to rest.</p>
<p>"Such a couple, I'm afraid they'll get sick—no restraint at all!" Wu Jun, who was disturbed beyond endurance, often worried about them like this.</p>
<p>"Yes, I didn't expect there to be such people who斵伤生命—but they say that this environment is really not good for us!" I went on to warn ourselves.</p>
<p>"Later, we have to find a way, when they...(please forgive me for replacing it with...) we will狂呌, to see if they still dare to be so放纵!"</p>
<p>"Yes, indeed, we only have this扫兴 plan!"</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, it was not灵騐 at all, which was really annoying. We犯呌, but they became even more狂暴, as if they were deliberately proud and示威 towards us. Therefore, we转舵掉向 and发駡借题, but they just pretended not to understand.</p>
<p>We have been annoyed like this for almost two weeks. I only respect and stay away from them, retreat three舍, and one late night, I went to a friend's house to borrow a night.</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, I came back, and it was said that this pair of hot young couple had moved away, and it was said that they had moved back to the countryside. There were two explanations for the reason of the move. According to the news探来 by Wu Jun, it was like this:</p>
<p>"Because the man got sick and couldn't make a living, so they moved back to the countryside."</p>
<p>According to the second landlord:</p>
<p>"Because the man discovered that the woman was a bit irregular, and had a苟且暧昩 affair with Li Dayou in the back building, so he sent her down to the countryside."</p>
<p>"No matter what the reason for moving away, it's finally relieved our annoyance!" I said with a庆幸透了着.</p>

<h3 id="e286">Disaster from the Sky <a href="#e286" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c286" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">286</a></h3>
<p>Dear Editor:</p>
<p>I am a female student about to graduate from junior high school.</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>Formally, I seem very fortunate, often with the protection of my parents and the guidance of my teachers; but disaster has struck from the sky, and now a very serious problem has arisen, which may prevent me from living such a comfortable life again, and if it is not handled well, perhaps my family will be disbanded one day.</p>
<p>The matter is like this: My father had a concubine fifteen years ago (she was a prostitute). At that time, my mother strongly opposed it; but because of the opposition, she suffered a lot of abuse and tasted all kinds of oppression and suffering. Now, she (that prostitute) is still working outside as my father's concubine, and my mother! She just pretends not to know, doesn't ask or hear, and they also live in peace. Who knew that last month, my father brought up the old matter again and proposed the idea of bringing her into the house. My mother certainly refused to agree, crying and arguing, and this lasted for a month. Later, after the explanation of many elders and the persuasion of friends, she agreed. However, after entering the house, she still lived outside.</p>
<p>Today, when I came home from school, I saw my mother crying there again; I was shocked and knew that something must have happened. The reason is very simple: this afternoon, my father brought home many ready-made little girl clothes, saying that she (that prostitute) sent them to me, my sister, and my little brother; at that time, my mother thought why she needed to please us, and the two had a quarrel. When my father was leaving, he said that after the Dragon Boat Festival, he would not be responsible for all the expenses of the family.</p>
<p>My father often uses this sentence to intimidate my mother; but this time my father seemed to say it in a serious tone, and I am afraid that there will be a day to implement it. If it is implemented, then what will happen?</p>
<p>If I drop out of school and go to make a living, one person may not have problems; but how can the elderly grandmother, the unfortunate mother, the ignorant young sister, and the young brother who is not yet one year old, as well as a wet nurse and a little maid, support a family of seven! And how difficult is it for a weak woman of seventeen years old to go to the dangerous path of society to make a living? The future is boundless, what kind of occupation is good to find! After thinking about it thousands of times, there is no good way.</p>
<p>Dear Editor: You are the guide of people, the bright light on the dark road. Seeing that you have already solved the problems of many people, please also give me practical guidance on this problem. I wish you</p>
<p>good health! Zhu Xu敬上</p>
<p>××××</p>
<p>Editor's Note: Ms. Zhu's letter seems to want to shoulder the responsibility of maintaining a family of seven: her ambition is commendable, but her actions are not feasible. You are a seventeen-year-old girl who has not graduated from junior high school. I am not afraid that you will get angry and say a word. Your knowledge and experience are still immature. It may be difficult for one person to take care of themselves, so how can they shoulder this family burden? Therefore, this matter should find another way out. You still have to continue your studies, and wait until your knowledge and experience reach a considerable level before considering it.</p>
<p>The art of dealing with the world as a person lies in having a consistent spirit. Be firm to the end, and be gentle to the end. Although it sounds good to be both firm and gentle, if it is not done well, it will often fall into a dilemma. Your mother suffered a loss in this regard regarding the matter of your honorable father taking a concubine. Speaking of firmness, since you had already opposed it, you can always oppose it to the end according to the legal provisions of one husband and one wife. Why did you agree to her entering the house. The law stipulates that those who obtain the consent of the wife shall not be convicted of bigamy. Speaking of gentleness, then after allowing her to enter the house, when she sent clothes, whether it was pleasing ghosts or sincerely wanting to be good, you should not have broken out and抢白.</p>
<p>Now, the matter can still be salvaged. He will never really abandon his old mother, wife, and children because of legal reasons; just give him a way out, I am afraid that he will really have the nerve to ignore the household expenses? However, constant quarrels between families are not a good thing, so I hope that Ms. Zhu will persuade her mother to think about it. Now that things have become a reality, you can only use the means of gentleness to overcome firmness.</p>

<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>The night was already deep, and Master Zhang was sleeping beside her again. This evening, Master Zhang was very興旧, he not only told her that he had recently運動 his superiors with 15,000 yuan, and would be dispatched to take office immediately, but also said that he would marry her back, and in the future, she would have children, and after the death of the first wife, she would inevitably be promoted. She had heard such words from his mouth dozens of times, and it was inevitably troublesome to say them again and again, but today they also made sense; it was easier to be蹂躪 to death by one man than to serve many men at the same time, right? As for whether she would be promoted in the future, there was no need to worry about it. So:</p>
<p>"Okay, I'll marry him."</p>
<p>This妖精, but because she had no hope of having a son, she had to allow it; now that the old ghost was dead, a寡婊子 would certainly not be able to give birth to a drop of blood, and Master Zhang had said such words when he was dying, so Miss Liu could not be considered Master Zhang's姨太太.</p>
<p>The bank deposit book in her hand was taken back by the housekeeper on the third day after the old man's death. In addition to allowing her to keep the gold and silver jewelry as souvenirs, she was also given 1,200 yuan as maintenance expenses. Before finding someone, she was allowed to continue living in this building: in this way, the first wife's character was also very generous.</p>
<p>But Liu Gu was not concerned about these, 　silver money and property, she had never had a good plan for. However, she always had to live on, and this point did not seem to be a problem, so how should she live on? She still had a good plan for this. So this question lingered in her mind for several days, but she could only be aware of a few points, which were: 丨</p>
<p>"I am a widow now. But it's not surprising, probably a罚 woman can't avoid being a widow...</p>

<h3 id="e289">A Visit to the Kamata Photography Studio in Japan <a href="#e289" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c289" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">289</a></h3>
<p>— Donglin</p>
<p>What I Saw One Morning Four Years Ago</p>
<p>In my previously published "Japanese Film屑 Talk," I once said that this Kamata Photography Studio is the place where Shochiku Eiga Co., Ltd. specializes in taking modern films. In Japan, it is the oldest and best modern film photography studio.</p>
<p>This was one summer morning four years ago, right? At that time, I was still living in Omori, outside Tokyo. I got the news that the Kamata Photography Studio was open, and I quickly took the elevated train to Kamata. It was only one stop from Omori to Kamata, so in less than five minutes, I had reached my destination. Walking out of the Kamata train station, going north, and turning a bay, I saw the photography studio surrounded by red and white cloth in the distance.</p>
<p>After buying a ticket, I ran into a large house, where there were many long tables, on which were displayed countless models of buildings and vehicles. I asked the receptionist standing next to me, what are these used for? He said to me that these are the various houses and mansions reflected on the screen, and the fire scene is to burn these models. I listened to his words, half believing and half doubting, and left.</p>
<p>Walking out of the back door of this large house, just as I was about to move forward, my hat was blown more than a丈 away by the wind. I couldn't help but be surprised:: how can there be such a big wind in such good weather? I picked up my hat, and my curiosity led me to go over and see what was causing the trouble there. Turning a corner, I understood; it turned out that the wind was coming from a tall and large thing, like a fan. The engineer standing next to it was explaining to the audience that this machine was used to make狂风.</p>
<p>Leaving the crowd, I turned another corner and saw a small train station; there was a wooden train front in the station, installed in the appearance of parking. I thought this was the so-called train in the movie! Walking less than a few steps, there was a small pond in front, and the flowers and plants on all sides were cultivated like a garden. There are only a few steps away from a train station and a garden. This kind of scene cannot be seen anywhere other than a photography studio.</p>
<p>There were many people surrounded in front, so I also walked up, squeezed into the crowd, and saw clearly. It turned out that they were taking the scene of rain. Speaking of this rain, it was really ridiculous. This was just the water that people standing high up were撥 down! An actor, also without holding an umbrella, was戰慓ing like a "river ghost" being撥 by the water. I couldn't help but think of the hardships of being a movie actor.</p>
<p>Looking around like this, it was noon before I knew it. I was very hungry, so I went out to eat lunch.</p>
<p>Movie Review</p>
<h3 id="e290">Review of "Peach Blossom Village" Happy Ever After <a href="#e290" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c290" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">290</a></h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>Following "Tell Me Tonight" (Spring River Flower Moon Night), we now have this "Happy Ever After" with the same sentiment. This is, of course, not accidental. We can find the producer's intention to some extent in this. Everyone knows what the content of the previous film was, so there seems to be no need to dissect it here. So what does "Peach Blossom Village" tell us? It ridicules Hollywood producers and exposes young girls' fantasies about glamorous movies. However, these are not the main tasks of the film's creators. Its most important purpose is to teach the audience to escape reality in front of beautiful pictures and retreat to a utopia for the sake of perfect love. Obviously, in today's society, the idyllic life has long been destroyed by the realistic economic system, and we are no longer obedient people in a prosperous age. We struggle day and night. Is there any possibility for us to "return to Peach Blossom Village to live a leisurely life"? However, this is precisely the author's intention: to teach us to continue to fantasize in fantasy.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, in order to make the audience indulge in a beautiful illusion, there must be beautiful pictures. Therefore, the director must use skillful techniques to fill the film with romantic sentiments through singing and dancing, and add exquisite photography to enhance the intoxicating color, so that his mission can be accomplished.</p>
<p>However, the director is still not very lively in a few scenes. The most obvious is that Lilian Harvey is in the middle, with a male on each side, lined up and repeated, for several shots. This is inevitably too mechanical on the screen. Secondly, the director's sentiment is not soft enough, if "softness" is to be the essence of this film.</p>
<p>At the same time, there is no clear climax in the play, and no strong stimulation at all. Although these may not be necessary in the play, it cannot give the audience any impression. As far as the director is concerned, no characteristics can be found.</p>
<p>In terms of actors, no one has achieved amazing results, and they are all lazy and mediocre. The scene where the heroine Lilian Harvey dances in her dream and in front of the American producers reminds us of her past achievements, and she can still maintain that lively attitude in other aspects. Jack Hulbert and Sonnie Hale are not seen in this film, but there are also very few chaotic scenes.</p>
<p>The sound is good, and the scenery is also good. However, the best is the photography. However, no matter what, in terms of skill, it is indeed a film worth seeing.</p>

<p>— Fu Lun</p>
<p>Will Tour China</p>
<p>After Little Fairbanks divorced his wife Joan Crawford, he was suddenly accused of seduction. Fairbanks is resorting to legal solutions. (After this case is closed, he will pack his bags and travel west, where he will meet his father, Fairbanks, in Shanghai, and then go hunting in various places together. It is estimated that it will have to wait until the autumn is cool, because the lawsuit still needs to be delayed for some time. In addition, Little Fairbanks and Joan Crawford still visit each other from time to time after announcing their separation. According to Fairbanks himself, their relationship is closer than before, and they have gone out together four times, which is more enjoyable than traveling with any other woman. As for the divorce, he and Joan are unwilling to discuss it immediately, because neither of them intends to marry again. Little Fairbanks has vowed to wait until he has achieved success before talking about marrying again.</p>
<h3 id="e292">(Audience Opinions: Impressions of "Rouge Market") <a href="#e292" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c292" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">292</a></h3>
<p>— Shi Zeyong</p>
<p>Following "Flower of Freedom," the Star Motion Picture Company's "Rouge Market," a Four Seas Tong sound film, was released at the New Light Grand Theatre on the 14th! At first glance at the naming of these four words, we feel that this evil society, with the strong rouge color of Shanghai, can know the status of women in society, but only like this!</p>
<p>In Shanghai in the 20th century, the occupations of general women do not have a stable status at all; although they are shouting slogans of women's liberation, freedom, and improvement every day, which one has a thorough understanding? Even if they are as determined as Li Cuifen, they will inevitably be insulted and played with by capitalists. What about some women who are willing to degenerate?</p>
<p>Here, I do not intend to offend modern women; indeed, their will is too weak! And they don't understand the hypocrisy of modern society at all. They only rely on a moment of impulse, like "moths to a flame," rushing towards the place with light, forgetting the danger of the future, to seek a bright way out from the dark society, and they have to endure hardship to have good results. Otherwise, it's not that easy!</p>
<h3 id="e293">A Few Thoughts After Watching "Rouge Market" <a href="#e293" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c293" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">293</a></h3>
<p>— Mei Cun</p>
<p>"Rouge Market" is indeed a film with a better consciousness. It exposes the evil forces in society and the darkness between men and women, which makes me feel satisfied after watching it. The following are my thoughts after watching it:</p>
<p>First, there are no trams or cars around the department store, and even rickshaws are only one or two, and there are few pedestrians coming and going. I think that since it is called a department store, it should be located in a lively place like Wing On or Sincere, so that it can be suitable for the prosperity of a large company.</p>
<p>Second, the scene inside the company should also be decorated more lively. For example, there are only elevators that go in and no elevators that go out, and there are only four or five, which seems too bland.</p>
<p>Third, it is also inappropriate for customers to flirt with female clerks when buying things in the rouge department, and for the female clerks to flirt with them. I think the audience is dissatisfied with this point. Several friends sitting next to me were saying, "There is simply no such thing."</p>
<p>Fourth, Hu Die, who plays Li Cuifen, has excellent facial expressions, especially when she is thinking silently, her pupils flash, and her worries are fully revealed. If she had used other people's voices to explain her meaning at that time, it would have been more powerful.</p>
<p>Fifth, the last few scenes show the results of the struggle, from picking tea leaves to answering the phone and opening a small shop. The introduction of several sections of life is very simple, which is the director's cleverness.</p>
<h3 id="e294">My Review of "Rouge Market" <a href="#e294" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c294" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">294</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Qiong</p>
<p>The Insertion of Love is Unreasonable</p>
<p>Women's occupation is indeed a serious problem in our current China. It is not harsh to say that general companies, banks, and stores recruit female employees, and the beautiful name is to promote women's occupation, but in fact? It's just to attract general, lustful people. Therefore, many insulting nicknames for women have come: what vases, screens, and living signs, instinctively tell us: women's occupation in China is just playing around. If you are not coquettish and charming, you cannot attract customers, and if you do not show loyalty to your superiors, you cannot keep your job. This is the golden rule of women's occupation. "Rouge Market" grasped this realistic women's issue to expose it, although it is very appropriate; but we believe that the exposure is not enough, and an unreasonable placement of a distorted love story shook the entire play itself and blurred the audience's mind!</p>
<p>In the ending, it is too full of Romance, because it will not be so rapid and successful to struggle out of work. The old wolf mother, so-called to recognize the shortcomings of society, also has not recognized at all.</p>
<p>As for the expression: too contrived, it is possible for female employees to hum and sing, but it is too much to dance in the counter; the young manager's rubbing his eyes to look at female employees is too contrived; Hu Die's several crying scenes are very good; Wang Xianzhai is successful.</p>

<p>Sacrificing Reputation and Happiness for Love</p>
<p>Ernest started chatting again, but another twist came. An old car, turning and twisting through the crowd, crashed violently into the back of the prince's car. Angela looked anxiously out the back window, her father and the driver scurrying off to investigate how badly the car was damaged.</p>
<p>The person who came out of this old car was wearing a military uniform! A soldier, Angela thought, was beautiful. The man, glimpsing her curious gaze, ran to the car.</p>
<p>"Good morning," he said, with a charming smile. But Ernest pulled down the window curtain at the sight of this expression. "Shameless!" he grumbled, with an aristocratic temper. The car then started moving.</p>
<p>"Who was that?" the young soldier asked his laughing companions as he ran back to his car.</p>
<p>"That, Giovanni, is old Prince Sheremende," one person said. "And that beautiful princess is his daughter."</p>
<p>Giovanni patted the engine of his dilapidated car as if he had found a treasure. His heart had already floated away, following the charming smile of the beautiful shadow carried by the gorgeous car.</p>
<p>At the Sheremende Palace, Ernest, adhering to the details, kissed Angela's hand and said with a smile that he was rushing to catch a train to Rome. Angela scurried to the window facing the town, leaning out in quiet reverie.</p>
<p>"They are so happy, Mina," she said. "Listen to that music!" She slightly lifted her skirt and tried a dance step.</p>
<p>"Mina, I dreamed of him again," she said, blushing.</p>
<p>"Who is he?" Mina asked, doing needlework.</p>
<p>"The person I dreamed of. This time his name was Wolanski. He was riding a white horse with black spots. Mother was there too. She was very beautiful! Golden hair. Does Mother have golden hair? Why are there no photos of Mother?"</p>
<p>This was not a new question, but Mina replied:</p>
<p>"I told you! Because your father doesn't want it." Angela returned to the balcony, leaned on the railing, and gazed intently.</p>
<p>"Mina," she said suddenly, "let's go out! Is it still two o'clock for us to eat? Let's go see the carnival!" Angela said, rushing into the room, grabbing her shawl. "I'll go alone," she resisted, said, and ran away. Mina said, "You can't!" and grabbed his coat and hurried to catch up.</p>
<p>It's really lively to see the carnival up close! Her heart was pounding. Farmers mixed with soldiers, dancing, playing, and the front of the parade had characters from unofficial history, giants, and monsters made up of two or three people. A horse, with its nose stretched out, sniffed at the extremely happy Angela, and suddenly fell to the ground, rolling over and over. At this moment, the soldier from the old car appeared in the crowd, standing in front of them, bending slightly.</p>
<p>"Good afternoon, Princess," Giovanni said. This time, there was no stern hand to pull down the curtain between him and that charming, blushing face.</p>
