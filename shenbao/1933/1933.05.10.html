<p>時評</p>
<h3>日蘇糾紛與蘇聯出賣中東路實</h3>
<p>日本乘世界經濟恐慌深化。我國困於天災人禍之際。不顧國際信義。竟以武力奪占我東北三省。熱河灤東。同遭浩刧。察哈爾以至平津。均陷於日本帝國主義侵略之恐怖中。於焉遠東和平。悉被毁滅。國際均衡。盡爲破壞。我國希望國聯仗義執言之外交政策。固已完全失敗。同時英美在華利益。亦受威脅。世界經濟因此亦蒙受莫大之間接影響。</p>
<p>北美合衆國。憤恨日本帝國國主義之横暴。痛惜對華市塲將被割裂。然彼方正忙於鎭定金融。無力西顧。故其初擬即對蘇恢復十五年來已斷之國交。用圖在經濟上政治上。協力制止日本。使之不敢過度猖獗。徒以英蘇關係惡化。英美又有暫時協調之可能。而美國又以戰債通貨。及貿易等國際間之急難。必有待於英帝國之援助。是以擱起美蘇復交之進行。先圖英美之諒解。况英美兩國果能齊一步調。成立一時妥協者。則法國自不致横生異議。如是則不須軍事上任何流血行動。僅以相對的經濟封鎖。已足使日本屈服而有餘矣。蓋日本占領東北。雖自謂持「日滿經濟聯盟」武器。即能自給。殊不知日本爲輕工業國家。棉花旣無所出産。生絲又何處消售。煤油百分之七十以上。均仰給外國。鋼鐡原料丨丨鐡鑛石百分之九十。皆屬外國出産。僅此四端而論。日本已不能不畏懼經濟封鎖。故復轉其兇鋒。不待吉會鐡道及延吉三姓鐡路之完成。即借中東路扣車問題。顯明表示其對蘇聯挑戰之態度。其實非眞有開戰之决心。特借此以見好於英美。希圖緩和英國所暗示之經濟封鎖。而欲進一步以侵略我國也。</p>
<p>東北三省國際關係。原甚複雜。在前尤以中蘇日三角對立爲甚東北政權屬於我國時。我國勢雖弱。而爲日本之假想敵之一。了無疑義。因此蘇日衝突。得我國居間緩衝。尙不至於直接爭鬥。換言之。中東鐡路尙能在帝國主義環伺之下。儼然存在。頃者我國之東北統馭。權旣爲日人攫去。蘇聯之應付。亦感困難。第一在經濟方面。大連爲南滿之吞吐港。黑龍江西部之産物。亦因洮昂四洮兩路之啣接。而爲大連所吸收。吉林農産。黑河流域穀倉。原爲中東路開發之鵠的。吉會路完成延吉與三姓綫築就後。則淸津。雄基。二港。勢將包圍海參威。并刦制其海上的出路。於是中東路。僅有以西比利亞大鐡道勾通歐亞兩洲之單純任務。在軍事上亦將處於被動地位。而失其操縱之力。况蘇聯際此時機。一面欲以鐡冷的靜觀態度。待帝國主義各國矛盾之展開。一面欲續持其傳統的和平政策。鞏固其以往建設。中東路而爲日本借傀儡之名。用武力封銷者。蘇聯設無以鐡拳解决之决心。對此蠻横行動。自無有效辦法。而美蘇國交又未恢復。英蘇關係。且已隔離。目前國際形勢。蘇聯實處於不利地位。是以寗肯提出政治上之犧牲。聲言將出售中東路。以暫時緩和當前之緊迫情勢。而堅要三億金盧布巨額之代價。以難日本。其手腕亦極敏活也。</p>
<p>然而就法理立場論。蘇聯如不得我國之同意。决不能單獨出賣。蓋中東路照中俄協定爲中蘇合辦。蘇聯一方斷無貿然出賣之理。故今日蘇聯出賣之說。如爲一種外交手段。藉以延宕時間。緩和對日之緊急形勢。則我人猶可曲諒。若俄人爲環境所迫。而眞欲出賣於日。則蘇聯實未顧及中俄之邦交。違背中俄以往之協定。蓋今日之東北三省。雖被僞日强佔。但我國决當力圖恢復而不能承認其永久强佔。則蘇聯又烏能以我未放棄之中東路主權而出賣之。此則蘇聯政府亟應加以反省者也。</p>

<p>（華盛頓）　當美國務副卿斐理伯答復各方詢問護僑情形之際、美總統羅斯福正在白宫接見中國財政部長宋子文與中國公使施肇基、商榷遠東問題與經濟事件、其後國務卿赫爾與斐理伯亦一同加入討論、蓋今午美總統先在白宫宴請宋部長施公使等、並邀政府要人與國會議員數人作陪、宴畢即開始談話、據官場消息、遠東之政治安定、亦爲討論事項之一、並聞美總統準備坦直討論遠東事件、撮述其對於安定經濟的必要條件之意見、當總統與宋施會晤前、曾語其顧問云、渠信政治之寧靖、爲恢復歐洲與各地經濟之先决條件、故料總統對於復興遠東商業、亦將談及此種信仰此外改善白銀之鑄幣地位、亦將討論及之據稱、總統尤亟欲詢知提高銀價後對於中國國内外貿易之影響、當宋氏赴白宫前、總統曾召參院外交委員會主席畢德門密談、畢氏爲白銀派中堅、曾一再進言總統改善白銀地位後、將可早策美國對華貿易之進步者也、現畢德門與其他白銀派議員將俟總統與宋氏交換意見後、立即會晤宋部長商詢銀價對於中國之影響、今日參議字已通過韋勒决議案、訓令倫敦會議美代表設法訂結復用白銀爲貨幣之國際協定、此舉亦足以開啓美要人與中國代表討論銀問題之門戶云、（八日國民電）</p>

<p>軍分會聲明何軍並未前進</p>
<p>北平特訊、自灤東日軍撤退後、其主力集結海陽鎭深河堡一帶、對於我軍時有壓迫行動、最近日方宣稱、仍决定向灤東進兵、以致灤東形勢極形緊張、何柱國因向何應欽報告灤東情形、特於六日下午一時、由灤縣專車來平、記者在車站晤何、所談如下、、</p>
<p>灤東軍事情况</p>
<p>何柱國云、日軍撤退後、最近仍有向我再度進攻企圖、故對於秦皇島與海陽鎭地區、仍置有相當兵力、以爲將來軍事活動之聯絡、刻我最前線在北載河附近、故在海陽鎭及飲馬河東之部隊、每於黑夜向我襲擊、其行動仍爲挑釁、且敵軍飛機、到處轟炸、日軍向國際虚僞宣傳、全係欺人之語、盧龍遷安東北區、爲桃林營·建昌營·東西峽口一帶、敵近增加一個旅團、向灤河渡口活動、並不時用砲火威脅我軍、預料灤東二次戰事、不久即將發動、萬總指揮（福麟）前夜已抵開平、本人抽暇來平、向何委員長報告前方情况、在平不多逗留、俟接洽事項辦妥、即返灤縣指揮軍事云云、</p>
<p>敵提無理要求</p>
<p>灤東方面、自日陸軍省發表荒廖聲明後、形勢復趨緊張、秦皇島日軍高級軍官、於四日致電灤州、約何柱國赴秦埠會議、何即電復、謂「雙方現處敵對地位、且本人負軍事重責、不能前往、」嗣開灤礦局英當局、又電何氏、對何到秦皇島之一切、負責担保、决無危險、何比派參謀長陳某赴秦皇島、晤日軍當局、但日方拒絶與陳談判、竟謂非何親來不可、陳詢以約何會議内容、日人表示「日「滿」軍自灤東撤退後、中國軍隊節節進逼、致「滿洲國」國境感受莫大威脅、希望華軍即日撤出灤東、此後雙方均不駐屯軍隊、以維和平、並限何柱國於六日晚七時以前圓滿答復、如逾時限、華軍仍不撤退、日方即派空軍轟炸」云、陳當返灤復命、何以不敢擅自答覆、於六日七時、由灤到津、即下車往晤于學忠、密談兩小時之久、至九時許、登車赴平、竭何應欽、請示應付方略、</p>
<p>日人顚倒黑白</p>
<p>軍分會某要人談、六日報載日陸軍省對於灤東方面華軍之挑戰、再度發表聲明、略謂四月二十二日前後、關東軍根據關内不進出之方針、軍隊撤回長城線、乃何柱國等軍再渡灤河、接近長城、復出於挑戰之行動、對於日軍加以攻擊、現該方面之事態已陷於緊張而急迫等語、此種談話、顯與事實不符、蓋自灤東日軍撤退後、從四月二十一日起、復向我南天門陣地猛攻、激戰至八日之久、所謂不進關内者、直是自欺欺人之談、且灤東之日軍、雖然撤退、我軍仍扼灤河而守、僅有極少數部隊、開往昌黎·盧龍·撫寗·等縣城、維持地方秩序、何柱國軍長所部亦僅有小部騎兵、維持鐡路行車之安寗、其步兵旣未向前推進、何從對日軍加以攻擊、至謂何部長運動外使調停云云、尤屬毫無根據、蓋何應欽在此僅負軍事上臨時督率指揮之責任、政治外交均由中央直接辦理、日方之爲此言、似含有其他作用也、</p>
<p>高友唐查覆</p>
<p>杭市長被控案</p>
<p>謂原控理由殊欠充分</p>
<p>現旣未塡湖無須制止</p>
<p>杭州市長趙志游被控標賣西湖風景地一案、經監察院派監察委員高友唐、前往調查、茲覓得高委員報告書原文如下、「爲呈覆事、奉派赴杭調查杭州市市長趙志游被控標賣西湖風景地一案、現已查竣、據實呈報於下、查原控理由、歸納約有三端、（一）西湖數千年向用人工開濬、何以現在需鉅欵購機器、（二）破壞柳浪聞鶯之名勝、（三）毁掘墳墓、友唐所調查似原控以此爲理由、殊欠充分、（一）現在科學昌明、西湖果須開濬、自以機器爲便、豈能以　用人工作此食古不化之論、（二）柳浪聞鶯、雖爲西湖十　之一、友唐親往履勘、僅　一殘碑在荒烟蔓草中、旣無柳浪、更無鶯可聞、趙市長聲稱、將來塡湖之後、原碑仍移置湖濱、加以點綴、不獨不破壞、且可煥然一新、（三）挖泥塡湖、在未成地之先、完全爲水、旣無墳墓、無所謂毁掘、後面陸地雖有忠義墳墓、回敎墳墓、與新塡之地無涉、依上論斷、則原控所持理由、不能成立、友唐復面詢該市長濬湖塡湖之理由、據答稱、西湖歷年淤污、急需疏濬、疏濬必需購機器、所費甚鉅挖出之泥、無處堆積、只有湧金門外（即柳浪聞鶯附近）湖角、將此泥塡成陸地標賣、並於新塡之地、開闢馬路、加以整理、一舉而兩得、從前蘇東坡建築蘇堤、亦係疏濬湖泥、堆積而成、統計湖面、約計九千畝、擬塡者不過百分之一等語、友唐偕同該市府參生蛒一學鑾、工務科長烏聿定、至湧金門沿湖履勘、約計擬塡之湖長三十餘丈、寛五十餘丈、據該參事等云、</p>
<p>四月十五日投標者寥寥無幾、與原定預算、相差太鉅、塡湖計劃、恐難實現、友唐以西湖之美、全在於水、濬湖不妨另籌經費、淤泥亦非無其他方法消納、何必塡沿湖之地、如該市長計劃濬一次、塡一次、則百數年后西湖將有滄海桑田之變、殊非保存名勝之道、况蘇東坡迄今八百餘年矣、此八百年中、不知已濬湖若干次、未聞以泥塡湖濱、豈古人之智、獨見不及此乎、從前阮公墩·湖心亭·三潭印月·均係以泥堆成、於湖之面積、毫無妨碍、似可仿照辦理、於湖心另闢陸地、或於附近低窪田地塡積、不患泥無消納之處、若謂爲整理計、何不於柳浪聞鶯附近一帶、舊有之地、加以整理、奚必塡出新地方可整理耶、且行政院曾有禁止人民沿湖建築房屋、妨害風景、人民不准建築房屋、而市府獨可沿湖賣地、未免自相矛盾、似趙市長所持理由、亦難自圓其說、友唐更詢之杭州士紳、徴之輿論、多數反對塡湖、再研究投標不踴躍之原因、大致由於現在無地可得、須投標交欵購機、挖泥築地、工竣至速須一年有半、工竣之後、此項湖泥、俗稱香灰泥、非兩年不能晒乾堅固、目前地旣等於鏡花水月、孰肯投資、况時局變幻無常、官廳等於傳舍、後來之市長、能否維持前市長之政策、不無疑問、是以人多觀望、不肯標買、趙市長亦認爲原定計劃、難以實現、現在旣未塡湖、無制止之必要、原控應暫無庸置議、以上調查各節、可否資送行政院參考、并候鈞裁、謹呈院長于、」（日日社）</p>

<p>主席報告</p>
<p>主席林美衍委員報告、略謂、今日是五九國恥紀念、其發生與結果以及如何洗雪這國恥、在我們每年紀念中、應該要了解的、這嚴重的國恥、發生有十八年了、而國恥反日益加重、我們每年開會紀念、祇有形式、没有實際去洗雪、所以弄到如此地步、這是令人非常悲觀的、回想十八年前的今天、袁世凱正做皇帝的迷夢、所以不惜把中國出賣、來滿足個人的慾望、當時國内官僚政客、祗知利祿薰心、以致有所謂籌安會的組織、這會發表專制與共和一文、麻醉民衆、同時日帝國主義即提出二十一條來脅迫政府、袁逆因爲要滿足慾望、就在五九下午一時、承認此賣國條件、其條件内容、共分五項、（一）關於山東靑島膠濟等問題、（二）關於滿蒙土地鐡路等問題、（三）關於漢冶萍煤礦問題、（四）是關於中國沿海港灣不得租借與别國問題、（五）是日本須顧問中國軍事警察的訓練問題、所以從二十一條分析起來、無異是中國的賣身契約、民衆覺得此種條件、無異把人民陷爲亡國奴、於是奔走呼號、君起抵制日貨、惟抵貨運動不能持久、對日本仍是不關痛癢、那時袁逆喪心病狂、因恐人民反對帝國、乃派使至日本、要求日本以武力援助、完成帝制迷夢、後來因受駐日各國公使反對、才未實現、至民七巴黎和會、由我國代表伍朝樞·顧維鈞·陸徴祥·王正廷·提出二十一條否認問題、日本因知此事理屈、即用種種手段、令小幡公使向各方運動、其時我代表雖强硬、惟結果二十一條、仍未提出討論、因該會爲列强所把持、我們終是失敗的、第二次到了華府會議開幕、我國認爲時機又至、復將此問題提出、故後來决定膠濟路由中國收回、同時償還日本墊欵、我們回顧過去的沈痛歷史、惟有向雪恥路上走去、但國恥如何湔雪、可分爲幾點說明、（一）不與賣國軍閥政客妥協、（二）救國必須奮鬧、禦侮須先團結、（三）統一須有領袖的領導、（四）剿滅共産黨、免除後顧之患、以上各點、本人認爲湔雪國恥的先决條件、我們應加以注意、</p>
<p>沉痛演說</p>
<p>總工會代表李永祥演說、略謂、今天兄弟來參加大會、承主席指定演說、又蒙諸位代表敦促、兄弟祇有勉强講幾句、不過兄弟是不能演說的、對於過去的歷史、也没有相當的研究、所以祇能在民衆立塲來說幾句話、我們知道國恥紀念會是年年有的、雪恥的方法也年年於紀念中說明的、但是祗在開會時說說罷了、有何人去實行呢、散會之後、還是盡情娱樂、國恥早巳忘却了、所以國恥仍日日增加、譬如有人要想謀一官半職、他在野時、說得非常好聽、但是就職之後、他的工作是爲個人的利祿、把公字完全擺在腦後、這還能幹得好嗎、最近募航空捐、小小的職員均被捐到、市黨部是六個月一次扣的、然而一般資産階級則始終不拔一毛、這不是很痛心的嗎、我們現在不要唱高調、要從實際來做才行云云、末呼口號散會、</p>

<p>華僑總公會</p>
<p>辯正墨領否認排華</p>
<p>列舉墨國排華經過事實</p>
<p>没收僑胞財産迫令出境</p>
<p>墨政府主動組織排華黨</p>
<p>墨領强詞奪理淆亂觀聽</p>
<p>墨西哥駐滬領事夫勒斯口、昨在各報發表絶對否認墨國有排華情事、同時並誣指此次被逐回國僑胞、係有不正當行爲、及違反該國移居律、新新社記者、昨特驅車至貴州路往訪全球華僑總公會總幹事彭燦光、叩詢究竟、當據彭君負責語記者云、昨閱本埠各報登載、駐滬墨領否認墨國排華一節、歸納其内容、大致如下、（一）墨國不特並未排斥華僑、而且優待華僑、外間所傳排華原因、係屬誤會、（二）華僑之被驅逐出境者、因犯有不正當行爲、及經營不正當事業所致、（三）如墨國果有排華舉動、中國政府及駐墨公使、當有正式官報云云、以上所述、駐滬墨領可謂信口唯黄、冀欲以一紙空言、</p>
<p>抹殺事實</p>
<p>旣虐待我僑胞、刦奪其財産强迫其出境、尤以爲未足、尙擬加我旅墨僑胞、以莫須有之罪、（不正行爲）爲驅逐出境之藉口、以圖掩飾天下人之耳目、此種手段、實屬自欺欺人、駐滬墨領、身爲外交人員、又自稱與我頗行友善、似不宜出此不負責任之言、强詞奪理、淆亂觀聽、殊不知墨國之排華、早爲天下所共見、又爲事實所證明、固非任何人能狡辯者也、然就該領事所言、（指上述數點）大都顚倒是非、茲爲避免外間誤會起見、有亟須根據事實、分别斥駁之必要、（一）墨國旣非排華、何以順善兩省、有排華黨之組織、旣有排華黨之發現、墨國政府、何以不制止之、是墨政府實爲排華之主動者、應負賠償我旅墨僑胞、因排華所受一切損失之完全責任、（二）我華僑寄跡異域、無論爲工爲商、多能潔身自愛、勤儉耐勞、爲外人所稱譽、而　　旅墨僑胞</p>
<p>雖有二萬之衆、以經商及種植爲多、亦頗能恪守居留政府法律、絶少不軌行動、此次墨政府、竟將我旅墨華僑、驅逐出境者達四五千人、究竟該華僑所犯何罪、應被驅逐出境者、墨政府旣未明令宣布、而駐滬墨領、所謂華僑有不正當行爲、及經營不正當事業、又無切實指明、是該領事不特虚擀事實、而且同情於墨國排華也、（三）我外交部迭據駐墨公使呈報、墨國排華情形、及僑胞所受精神與物質之損失、迭次提出抗議、又僑務委員會之奔走呼號、函電交馳、此非正式官報而何、駐滬墨領竟視而不見、聽而不聞、是該領事不特盲而且聾也、（四）墨國之所以放棄在華領事裁判權、並非因友善而放棄、乃因墨國</p>
<p>在華僑民</p>
<p>統計不過二三十人、無須領判權之必要、實因無需要而放棄也、彭君繼又述及墨政府確爲有意排華之主動者、爰將其排華手段分述如下、消極方面、墨國排華之起源、遠在二年前、當時因墨國工人失業日衆、始由失業工人在順省號召組織排華黨、而一般軍人政客竟附和之、政府則暗助之、於是勢力膨脹、爲所欲爲、繼而善省亦有同樣之舉動、互相策應、明比爲奸、而順善兩省、遂爲排之根據地、墨政府爲助長排華黨之威風起見、更容納其請頒行嚴格之苛例、限制華僑商店、每十人中應雇用墨國士人四名、此種强迫手段、開世界未有之惡風、此爲墨政府表同情於排華、及其壓迫華僑之消極手段也、至積極方面、排華黨旣得墨政府之同情、更利用我國之積弱</p>
<p>凌虐華僑</p>
<p>無微不至、刦奪財産、政府不問殺害人命、政府不理我旅墨華僑、處於雙層恶劣環境之下、迫得任人魚肉、居者死於虐政、行者挺而走險、墨政府爲掩飾國際耳目起見、遂借檢騐華僑册紙爲名、實行没收爲實、授意排華、專事搶刦華僑册紙、被搶之後、華僑遂失居留之憑證、墨政府乃藉口無權居留、遂下緊急之逐客令、此四千無辜旅墨華僑、卒被非法分帮遞解出境矣、此爲墨政府驅逐華僑之實情、及其壓迫之積極手段、吾人希望政府以革命外交精神、據理抗爭、更希望國内同胞、鼎力援助、爲我全體旅墨難僑、雪幾微之恥、策善後之方云云、</p>

<p>駐滬日領署</p>
<p>竟自設警察署</p>
<p>各地紛紛擴充警額</p>
<p>任意胡行用意叵測</p>
<p>新聲社云、自中日滬戰停止後、駐滬日領署、即積極從事於擴充警察、并另闢一警察署、查駐外領署、附設警察、實爲世界各國所無、日本此舉、實屬荒謬、昨悉且竟欲擴充至我國全國各地日領署、實爲可驚、茲分誌詳情如下、願國人注意及之　　擴充警察　本埠日領署、原無警察之設備、數年前添警察數人、爲守衛之用、外間尙不注意、及東北問題發生後、該項警察、遂擴充名額至二十人之多、去年中日滬戰停止後、該項警禁之設備、乃擴充至二百餘名、并另闢一警察署、附屬於領署管轄之下、然昨據新聲社記者調查、日方所擴充之警察、實數尙不止此、凡駐華日領署之設有警察者、近均加以擴充、茲附其重要者言之、計漢口日領署有警察一百五十餘名、天津除該處日租界之警察不計外、領署亦有一百五十餘人、靑島亦約一百五六十人、廣東方面十餘人、厦門福州等處數人、</p>
<p>有碍主權　查各國駐華領署、有取得領事裁判權者、有完全平等待遇無領事裁判權者、其已得領事裁判權者、亦并無設立警察或更進而另闢警察署之特權、乃日本領署竟有警察署之設立、實爲世界各國所僅見之怪現象、不可不注意也、據外交界人之意見、以爲中日條約中旣無此項規定、自應早日向日方要求取消、免將來再事擴充、有蠶食我國警察權之　、且所設立之警察、實不止一處、現已普及全中國各地日領署矣、</p>
<p>用意叵測　至日方耗費巨額之欵項、擴充駐在我國各地日領署之警察、其用意之所在、實莫可測、蓋駐在租界有當地警察爲之保護、駐在内地、亦有内地警察爲之保護、遇有戒嚴等時期、中國官廳且中臨時加派警察、嚴爲防範、而日方竟自行設立警察或擴充之、若謂專事逮捕朝鮮革命黨人而設、其誰信之、</p>
<p>德國名將</p>
<p>方西克德抵滬</p>
<p>字林報云、德國軍界耆宿方西克德將軍、業於昨（八日）日悄然來滬、下榻某飯店、據聞將軍此行純屬私人游歷、日前外間盛傳將軍受中國政府之聘、將任軍事顧問、嗣經可靠方面、加以否認後、目下亦未再續有所聲明、按將軍係一八六六年誕於施萊斯維格、其先世累代名將、家學淵源、一九一四年歐戰發生、將軍自少校立功、洊升至第三軍參謀長、更升任麥剛森統帥之總參謀長、嗣乃參謀士軍、設計破俄軍陣線、以功晋授將軍、其後又參謀東歐軍隊、屈服塞爾維亞、制止白魯雪洛夫之進攻、戰事告終、又從事改組德國陸軍、成績爛然、迨一九二六年乃以陸軍總司令致仕云、</p>
<p>馬丁公開演講三天</p>
<p>日内瓦對中日糾紛之觀察</p>
<p>新新社云、前日内瓦報主筆威廉馬丁氏、此次應本市各界敦請、在滬作公開演講、均由外交部駐滬辦事科長趙鐡章與馬氏接洽、原擬請馬氏演講四次、茲因馬氏不願多作演講、故除已經接洽决定三次公開演講外、不再增加、其第一次第十五日上午十一時至十二時、在徐家匯交通大學演講、第二次定十八日午刻、上海日報公會假八仙橋靑年會歡宴馬氏後、即於下午二時半起、舉行公開演講、第三次爲二十日上午九時半至十時及十一時至十二時、在楊樹浦滬江大學演講、聞馬氏在日内瓦時、對中日問題、仗義執言、頗引起世界同情、此次對報界講題、業經决定爲「日内瓦對中日糾紛之觀察、」想屆時必更有一番正論也、</p>

<p>常州少婦匡月娥、年華二十六、容貌姣艶、向居原籍、邇因其夫許生富在滬作賈、久無音信、不審存亡、思念之餘、遂於本月二日、整備行裝、隻身來甲訪問、寄寓舊曾結鄰之雲南路裕德里七號葉侍田家、葉以唱蘇灘爲業、每日須赴人世界游戲塲登臺、月娥素慕海上繁華、茲雖尋夫未遇、然　情逸興、初未由此而衰、故輙附葉之驥尾、往該塲游覽、以飽眼福、不意爲其中</p>
<p>獵艶之徒</p>
<p>所注目、見則一味挑逗、該婦心非木石、情竟濫施、某夕、遂被朱阿三·劉正雲項寳銑·三人誘至漢口路浙江路口其昌旅館闢室深談、但三男一婦、究難同宿經朱等自行約定由朱獨伴婦眠、劉項乃去、習晨好夢方濃之際、突有自稱朱妻之沈氏婦叩扉而入、責朱不應葉家珍而嘗野味、互相口角、月娥睹狀、</p>
<p>不勝羞慚</p>
<p>起身欲去、朱以劉項尙抱向隅、因將月娥轉讓、時劉適到、月娥見其西裝革履風度翩翩、羞慚之心頓歛、翻覺欣然色喜、從此日夕與劉相偕、日前劉以將赴杭作春游、囑婦同去、婦卽首肯、劉乃合其將寄頓與葉家之行李取回旅邸、並着朱沈氏帮同往搬、物旣取到、劉復對婦言卿之髮太覺舊式、殊欠雅觀、願陪往理髮店</p>
<p>重整雲鬟</p>
<p>斯時婦之心靈、已全被誘惑、唯劉之命是從、直抵五馬路某理髮店整容工作甫半、而劉忽稱赴杭火車、卽須開行、卿髮猶未剪畢、祇得先往購買車票、决遲卿於車站、言已掉首而去、月娥欲追則不能、待髮剪就、奔往逆旅、詎所有行李皆已不翼而飛、當因該旅館茶役黄元生曾誇劉</p>
<p>如何富有</p>
<p>以爲黄必知劉等踪跡、故亟向詢問、但黄反咎婦疏忽於是該婦遂報告老閘捕房派探目王樹森·探員曹岐山·調查之下、以黄元生涉嫌疑、當往拘獲、根據黄之供詞、馳往城内露香園路一百七十八號續獲朱沈氏、經該氏供明朱等匿跡所在、按址往愛文義路通商旅館一百三十八號房間起出原贓皮箱一只、繼往閘北華興路北洋旅館十一號房間、將朱、劉項·三名拿獲、該婦所帶</p>
<p>衣飾地契</p>
<p>等件、祗一金手表一鑽戒已被典質、茲向當舖吊出、餘物概未缺少、惟節操則被毁無餘矣、昨晨、由捕將朱等解送第一特區地方法院、由馮庭長提審、捕房律師汝葆彝陳明案情、請按照竊盜罪將被告懲辦、　由匡月娥訴明被誘經過、馮庭長嗣向各被告逐一研訊終结、以黄元生無罪、朱·劉·項·三名、各判徒刑一年六月、贓物原主領去、</p>

<p>主要人犯均在逃未獲</p>
<p>華界近來花會誘賭、異常猖獗、南市城内一帶聽筒航船、幾望衡對字、麟次櫛比、實開有花會賭博後之新記錄之怪現象、所以市公安局長特嚴令所屬注意搜捕、並訓令警察大隊隨時捕捉、以免朦蔽之虞、茲有城内小橋頭三十七號組織大規模之花會聽筒、並在虹橋南小白栅内分設銀錢機關、狡兎之窟、範圍之廣、足見一斑、其中主其事者、聞係股東性質、多屬稍具潛勢力之流氓及探員等人物、故肆無忌憚、每日詐取所得、在二千金以上、而其開銷之大、亦足駭人聽聞、現經人密告警察大隊、於前日派潘副官帶同第　中隊李巡長等馳往該處、按圖索驥、將其兩處機關完全破獲、抄獲銀洋·銀角·銅元·等、分裝三黄包車、當塲拘獲朱　　怡紅院妓女十三名</p>
<p>食海螺螄中毒</p>
<p>丨衛生局吳科長談原因丨</p>
<p>法租界東新橋街怡紅院妓院日前因廢歷立夏節、院主購買大批海螺　、分贈院中妓女、因所購者特别粗大、各妓女爭相攫食、不料竟有妓女十三人、於食後次日皆突然患病、頭痛發熱、腹病停食、遂疑中毒、然幸未有慘死情事、記者前往調查後、索得食餘之海螺螄數枚、</p>
<p>吳利國科長談</p>
<p>乃於昨日往訪市衛生局第二科長吳利國、告以始末、據談、海螺螄爲有壳硬性食物之一種、若腸胃消化力薄弱之人、食之過多、則頗易致疾、且海螺螄或因經過長久時間關係、壳内之肉、發生腐敗及叢生細菌、吃食亦甚危險、</p>
<p>魚業中人所談</p>
<p>記者又往訪魚業中人調查海螺螄産地所在、據云、係沿海沙泥灘中産生、潮退之際、俯拾皆是、但細小者在立夏節前食之、當無碍、而特别粗大者、若過立夏節後、即不可食、夏間蜻蜓中有一種紅蜻蜓、即不可食、夏間蜻蜓中有一種紅蜻蜓、即爲此種特别粗大之海螺螄所變、然以介類動物、而能變成飛翼動物、恐無是理也、</p>
<p>十三人幸無恙</p>
<p>該妓院妓女十三人、食後幸皆無恙、據彼等細心觀察之結果、則獲可疑之點、即此種粗大之海螺螄、經熱水泡煑後、其壳隙中頓現微細綠色、而平常細小之海螺螄、雖經熱水泡煑、則無此種變化渭生、三十二歲、嘉定人、張之星、四十一歲、上海人、秦阿祥、三十五歲、無錫人、朱金林、三十九歲、上海人、四名、其餘主要之金寳、並某處之李探員等、均被漏網未獲、一併帶隊、呈解究辦、惟昨日探得被捕四人因非要犯、聞已罰釋、</p>

<p>國恥週演講</p>
<p>章友三先生講中日關係之我見</p>
<p>五月七日在上海靑年會</p>
<p>各位，今天是國恥紀念演講週第一日，本來五月是一個多難之月，而五三，五七，五九等許多國恥日，尤其是與日本有關係。在此國難時期，紀念國恥，當然十分悲憤；但是在悲痛之中，應當想如何應付這個國難，現在時間很短，我簡單的講一點。</p>
<p>目前應付國難的主張，大致可分五點；一是戰，就是對日宣戰；二是和，就是與日本講和，三是拚，就是長期抵抗，四是賴，就是依賴國際的力量制裁日本；五是拖，就是不採任何辦法，只是拖延時日。我現在把這五筕主張來簡單的分析一下。</p>
<p>（一）主戰。現在日本對多種强暴侵略，九一八，一二八的暴行，以及熱河失陷，有加無已，這使我國人民的情緒興奮到萬分，當然誰都不願受屈，用武力對付，凡是有血氣的人，皆有此意。因此我們常可聽到宣戰，絶交等的呼聲。這種主戰辦法，單以情感血氣論，絶對没有人反對的，但是我們要把牠的利弊分析開來看。主戰的優點，第一是一旦正式開戰，可以使一般國民憤激的情緒。得以宣洩。雖則打仗犧牲很大，但是我們願意犧牲，因爲照現在沉悶的吃苦，委實比痛痛快快的犧牲更外難受。第二可以保持國家的人格。照我國現在情形，受盡壓迨而仍忍氣吞聲，在世界上實在難以立足，如果對日宣戰，勝敗不問，至少可以替國家爭回一點人格。第三，如果對外抗爭，或者可以促進中國内部的團結，現在國内仍是四分五裂之象，若對外宣戰，卽使不能誠心團結，但至少各方也不敢公然鬩牆。第四，開戰可以轉變國際間的空氣。各國外交政策，可以因我國的抵抗力高下而轉移。蓋中國現爲世界工業先進各國大好銷貨市塲，萬一中日宣戰，當然足以危及他們的商業關係，他們就不得不出而干涉。尤其是英，美，與遠東關係最深，長江流域，完全是英人勢力範圍，一受牽動，英人必然出塲。凡此種種，皆可以戰爭引起世界共同制裁日本之動機。這五點主戰理由，當然是理論方面的。在實際上宣戰有没有要難呢？主張不戰的，以爲對日宣戰不可能。有五點。（甲）無戰器。我國軍隊，約有三百萬之衆，爲數雖不少，但是新式的戰器太缺乏了。我們知道，現代戰爭，是非靠新式武器是不行的。海軍尤其可憐，盡全國所有的軍艦，總噸數不過三萬噸。空軍方面，現在各界雖在提倡航空救國，有無效果，還不能說。我們常在報上看到北方有大刀隊，在東北屢挫强敵，他們的勇敢精神，自然値得我們十二分的敬佩，但說要以一個血肉之軀，仗着一把刀，就可以與飛機，炸彈。坦克車爭短長，只要稍爲有點常識的人，都會知道事實上難以辦到。（乙）無軍紀。對外作戰，必須要指揮統一，令出必行。現在北方作戰軍隊，並無密切聯絡，各自爲戰，竟有一方戰事緊張非常，另一方則袖手旁觀，若絲毫不戰事緊張非常，另一方則袖手旁觀，若絲毫不關痛養。卽如最近熱河戰事緊張時，但在長城一帶竭力作戰的，只有孫殿英，宋哲元等，其餘多數是按兵不動。如此爲戰，勝算幾何？（丙）無外交。現代的國際戰爭，絶不能以一國孤立而與人對抗的。現在國際上可以和我國站在同一戰綫的有那一國。外交上没有契合，勝利絶無希望。（丁）無接濟。軍事上軍需及運輸很是重要。我國工業交通。俱無根基。卽煤油一項，作戰時萬不可少的，假使海口一被封鎖，絶了煤油的來源，卽使有了飛機，坦克車，也只好停着不能動。還有銅鐡，硫酸，硝酸，鹽酸，一切機械等，都是仰給外國，在運輸停頓時，都要引起恐慌。還有糧食缺少，也成問題。（戊）人民無組織。現在如要對日作戰，必須全國動員，若人民缺少組織能力，前方勝負未分，後方已起紛擾，這也是作戰的障碍。綜合以上數點，所以一般人認爲對日作戰的結果是毫無把握的。（二）主和。在九一八以來，没有一人要和，并且也没一人敢講和，現在却因日人逼進關内北方已有人開始公開地討論言和。他們的主張是放棄關外各地以保全平津。不過言和是要有條件的。言和的條件：（一）若兩國勢均力敵，一旦起了糾紛，勝敗未分，爲免兩敗俱傷，自以言和爲上。在此種情形下是可以和的；（二）若是兩國之中，有一國先大敗而後轉小勝，形勢上有了轉機，就此言和，總勝於城下之盟，在此情形下，也有言和可能；（三））兩國爭持不下，而第三强國出來干涉，那也可言和，因爲兩方同受壓迫，不至呌一方過分吃虧，（四）兩國之中，勝者方面因爲已是筋瘦力竭，願意結束戰事，敗者方面，在此時言和，也還不至吃大虧，在這情形下，也有言和可能。這是可以言和的四個條件。現在我們要言和，這四種條件有没有呢？當然一種也没有。然則又如何可以言和？就是退一百步講，言和至少要在九一八事件剛發之始，彼時還有開談判的可能，現在四省早已被佔，行且侵及平津，若在此時再去與日本言和，那老老實實就等於城下之盟。而且卽使放棄東北，以長城爲界，求苟安於一時，但是否卽能滿足日人的慾望？這是恐怕不能！日人對大陸之野心極大，他勢非完全吞併我國不能滿足，不獨對我國有此野心，卽對英美在東亞的領土，他也想席捲而下。這樣講起來，言和一條路是萬萬走不通的。並且此時亦絶無人敢公然担負　和的責任，所以和是辦不到的。（三）主拼。拼就是長期抵抗之意。旣無力量宣戰，換一種策略，使敵人筋疲力竭，内部崩潰。此法雖不比正式宣戰，節圍大，但器械指揮接濟等等，也當有相當籌盡，這是指我們的抵抗方面講。至於對日本的侵略，日本國家新預算，本年度收人十二萬萬八千餘萬，支出爲二十二萬萬三千餘萬，二者相抵不數十萬萬元，其中海陸軍費佔到八萬萬元，這是日本的耗費，日本國債共有六十三萬萬，平均每一國民須負担一百元。從這上面講，日本内部的崩潰，末嘗不可能，總之日本國内經濟吃緊，是無可諱言的。但彼正因此故，急急攫取東北，就爲要解决經濟困難，所以他們視東北爲生命線。東三省物産豐富，如木材大豆鋼鐡煤沙金牧畜穀類等等，收入不資。一經日人開發，便是無限的富源。又如海關稅收，民二十年度爲二千六百萬兩，鹽稅爲一千九百萬兩，在日本旣得了以上種種，可以稍解經濟上的恐慌，又可以實行大量移民。日本現在農村破産，工人失業，處處發生動摇，原有岌岌之勢，但自從打了勝仗，盡力對人民宣傳，麻醉人民，頗足以增加人民對政府的信仰。日本派到東北的日軍，不過五萬人約三師團以上，就足以横行無忌，而受着無限荼毒的，却是我國的人民。所以說拼，也不是目前所能見效的。（四）主賴，就是依賴他國之出而助我，用武力來制止暴日。這最是下策，而且國際間的關係複雜錯　，目前要想他們用武力來說話，都是痴人說夢。現在國際形勢有利於日本的有數點，（甲）各資本主義國家反俄戰綫要仗日人作先鋒，不肯開罪日本。（乙）西歐各國互爭雄長，有些國家，例如法國，要在國際上得着奥援，極力拉攏日本。（丙）各國經濟衰落，無力顧到國際制裁。（丁）英美各大國，自身利益尙有若干衝突，步驟不能協調。最近華府會議，英美法雖有接近可能，然猶恐日本假意親俄以作要脅，照此情形，要歐美用武力制裁日本是很難的。卽使有任何國家出來，也對於我國毫無益處，無非各爭市塲而已。（五）主拖。就是拖延時日。目前正在實行的就是這個辦法。一天天馬馬虎虎過去，當然這是最不好的辦法，并且也不能算是辦法。可是到了現在，戰旣不能，和又不可，拚又辦不到，賴更靠不住，一部份人就只能以拖爲無辦法中之辦法了。在此一無所可的局面之下，我們應當怎樣呢？我們眼光要放遠點。我們所受的創痛，應當把他看做一種敎訓。假如能因此敎訓而力自振作，前途尙有一綫曙光，否則我國眞要　於萬刦不復。自從甲午以來，日本對我國的侵略，共有多少次，這許多的剌激，我們早應覺悟。但是我國人太不肯爭氣了。一次一次的剌激，只是白讓他過去，所以侵略之來，每次加烈。我們倘能細省受人侵略的原因，是起於我們自已的腐敗，那末要根本自救，還是要振新我們民族的精神。目前應付國難，只有兩個辦法，一是治標，一是治本，治標的辦法，應繼續竭力抵抗，並且要有更有力的抵抗。軍備的增加，指揮的統一，物質上的接濟，外交上的努力，都是抵抗必備的條件，治本方面，希望政府有四項要負責辦理，（一）國民生計，現在民不聊生，非得急切解决不可，（二）保障民權，人民基本權利，如人身，言論，結社的自由，必須保障。（三）澄淸吏治，嚴懲貪污。（四）準備國防。希望於人民方面的，就是本身人格的振作，把各人分内的工作加緊起來，把素日貪私懶怯等種種弱點，盡力革除，把民族的優點，盡量發搔，這才是我們立足於世界的根本道理。假如能够如此，則國難國恥，總有結總算賬的一日。（徐雉筆記）</p>

<p>春秋</p>
<h3>開縣老人</h3>
<p>— 瞻廬</p>
<p>昔日有一位絳縣老人，他在春秋時代，只不過說了幾句幽默話，把自己的年幾配成一個帶分數的甲子。當時晋大夫的算學程度太幼稚了，不瞻得用着諸等，命分的方式，解决這個問題：於是乎失驚道怪的哄動了一時，那七十三歲的絳縣老人，便從二千數百年前流傳到今日之下。怪不得蕭伯訥愛說幽默話，原來說幽默話的有這麽大的效力。</p>
<p>開縣老人李靑雲逝世，已載在報端的重慶專電，道他行年二百五十六歲方才脫離塵世。靑雲的「靑」字，大約是「慶」字的誤傳；記得民十七年海上各報，徧登一位四川李慶雲老人的攝影，道他年已二百五十歲，是開縣山川村人。他的年齡雖高，但，照片上的精神，倒也十分淸健；卻不料忽忽五六年間，他依舊跳不出這一座生死關，他竟屈伏於死神之下了。</p>
<p>開縣老人作古了，他的年齡超過了絳縣老人三倍又七十三分之三十七。倘使，年齡愈高，傳世愈遠；那麽，絳縣老人已傳了二千數百年，開縣老人合該要傳名七八千年了。然而，不見得吧！年代之輪一直的轉下去，絳縣老人四個字决不會磨滅，開縣老人的姓名只怕不會深深地映入人家的腦蒂吧。</p>
<p>會得說幾句幽默話，會得配成一個帶分數的甲子，會得使晋國諸大夫失驚道怪，這便是絳縣老人的傳世本領。試問開縣老人有没有這般的本領呢？倘使没有，那麽過了若干年，人人只知有絳縣老人，而不知有開縣老人了。</p>
<p>人要掙扎千秋，年齡不在乎高大；但看，孔門的顔子，三國的周郎。</p>
<h3>賣小孩</h3>
<p>— 小賢賢</p>
<p>賣小孩子呀」，是籠罩在不景氣中的上海的新興事業之一的口號，同不顧血本大廉價，買一送一」的招徠主顧，有異曲同工之妙。不信，請瞧，大街上，小巷裏，裝着一個無線電話，或是雇着一班外國吹打的商店門口，總圍着許多反背着雙手，「參觀」而不「賜顧」的佳賓。大街上，小巷裏，停着一副「賣小孩子」的擔子，一樣的也總圍着許多反背着雙手、「參觀」而不「賜顧」的貴客。</p>
<p>不錯，近來從河南陜西到上海來「賣小孩子」的，一天多似一天，於是上海的「小孩子」，竟成了過剩的局面，「去胃呆滯」。但要解决這說大不大，說小不小的問題，在這各國都感着人口過利的二十世紀初葉，恐也不能像皇軍佔據瀋陽兵工廠那麽「穩快便利」。</p>
<p>「賣小孩子」，究竟是不是悲慘的一幕，仁者見仁，智者見智，各有不同的說法。在這「鐡血救國」的年頭兒，在下以爲人身裏的五臓六腑，應當一律鋼鐡化，蛻化成爲「硬肚腸」。人家鼻涕眼涙，黏成一片，出賣小孩子，我只當他們是因不景氣而大減價那麽一回事，因爲偶而有一位「反動慈善家」，離人骨肉，用白花花大洋錢，買了一個小孩子，在這「人肉包子」無人過問的文明世界，總不見得把小孩子做肉餡。充極其量，總也不過把小孩子充一世奴隸罷了。在這任何人都有做奴隸指望的時代，做奴隸有甚可憐？</p>
<p>「俄死事小，失節事大」。妓女賣貞操，漢奸賣良心，没有人可憐，難民怕餓死而出賣小孩子，大家倒都大驚小怪起來了，這倒也是一個可解而不可解的謎</p>
<h3>士女？</h3>
<p>— 人英</p>
<p>這樣的把戲碰到第二次了。</p>
<p>第一次我趁在公共汽車上，車輪碾過了未毁滅前的神秘街上。我是朝着虹口公園進發，想到這裏透出些在都市裏積抑下來的窒息。</p>
<p>車中擠滿了人，乘客們都把眼光注視到坐在右角落裏的一個怪漂高的西裝靑年身上。他手裏捧着一束鮮花，旁邊坐着一個同伴丨怪漂亮的女人丨。</p>
<p>我隨着大衆注意着的視綫，也把眼光投射到他倆身上：不覺失聲的笑了。這怪漂亮的靑年，不是由一個美麗的姑娘而扮成男子的裝束嗎？車輪是不續的推進，儘有許我人在注意着這個「假丈夫」，伊的儀表是怎樣的自然；並不含有些許赧羞的態度！</p>
<p>虹口公園到了，我們隨着一羣人，連假丈夫在内；都映没有公園的門庭。</p>
<p>又是這樣的一次，我踏上隨着大上海而毁滅的老靶子路；去訪問我的一位同學丨成名了的作家。丨經同學再三的邀請，跑到一家帶有幾分藝術意味的佳妃館。在一張埀着絲織檯氈的圓檯上，我們是淺酌低談，把一個渺小的我；也置身在藝術的宫殿。玻門啓處，進來了二個時裝的靑年。我的朋友就向比較長的一個招呼，同時並且現出驚異的眼光，向這個面目娟好比較矮些的靑年招呼道；</p>
<p>「蜜雪絲徐；今天我可不忍識你了。」</p>
<p>於是我們在同一張檯子上。交換着各人的名片。</p>

<h3>東北四連長</h3>
<p>— 張恨水</p>
<p>第六回甜苦情場冷觀評兩面崎驅世路密約訂三年</p>
<p>這個時候，那位女士，笑容滿面，似乎忘了剛才遊行示威，喊着打倒日本帝國主義的那　件事。而且柔情似水，也不像有那種激昂慷慨神氣的人。他兩人走着走着，只見黄女士的一隻手，已挿入到連長的脇窩裏去，而且他的頭，只管偏着，也偏到連長懷裏來。看這樣子，多麽甜蜜，人生在世，不需要一個異性，來安慰一下子嗎？趙自强隨着兩位連長迷糊糊的走上電車，只管沉沉的想着。殷得仁拿了一張電車票向他手上一塞，笑道：老趙怎麽了？想些什麽心事？你看到小田那樣快活，也想找這麽一個嗎？你倒是現成呀。關耀武道：怎麽着，老趙也有個愛人嗎？趙自强突然挺起身子來答道：瞎說！我那有這樣一個人？殷得仁道：人是没有這樣一個人，不過他有個鄰居……關耀武笑道：有個老姑娘，爲人很賢德。趙自强低聲道：電車上不要談，行不行？關耀武見他這種神氣，以爲這裏面，果然有些神秘，一笑之下，把這事遏過去了。他們坐着電車到西南門，換了長途汽車到海甸，始終是座客擁擠的當中，不能再談到老姑娘。直到下了長途汽車，向趙自强家走。殷得仁道：關大哥，眞的，他鄰居那位老姑娘，人很是不錯。他每次回家，眞是一功而兩得，一來……趙自强瞪了他一眼道：老殷，你敢向下說，你向下說，不怕造口孽嗎？殷得仁笑道；我們先别提你的鄰居，我倒要問你切實一句話，你願意娶親不願意娶親呢？趙自强道：要像老關這樣受痛苦，我就一百輩子也不願娶親。關耀武接着歎了一口氣道：不討女人了罷。我今天不是和你兩個人回家。連電車錢都掏不出來，嗐！說起來，眞是糟心。殷得仁笑道：老關你忙什麽？他要說的一句話，還没有說完呢。他下面一句，就是這樣說，假使像小田那樣有趣，一輩子娶一百個，他也願意。趙自强笑道：快到家了，别說了。（六五）</p>

<h3>抽丁（上）</h3>
<p>— 天恨生</p>
<p>是一個恬靜的鄕村。雖然是國難臨頭了，多少廬舍在飛機炸彈之下燬爲灰燼多少頭頗在槍砲剌刀之下與肢體分離；但這村中還是很恬靜。只有有數的幾個人偶然上城時，隱隱聽得說打仗，却不很明白誰和誰打。他們當時也不免本能地吃驚，急於向認識的人問一問在什麽地方打，離這裏有多遠？而在聽說打的地方離這裏很遠後他們也就放了心，滿足似的不去追究誰和誰打了，他們回到村中，也自然不免和村中人談起；但大家也是這樣，祗要問明白離這裏多遠，便不多談，大家對此不感覺到驚恐。也不感覺有何興趣。</p>
<p>到晚上更恬靜。因爲天才黑，大家就已吃過晚飯，准備睡覺去丁。吃晚飯的時候，往往一而吃，一面看着太陽向西落下去，所以很少有點了燈上床睡覺的。晚上是更恬靜，只有時聽得狗吠聲，恬靜得像都市的深夜頒佈了戒嚴令一般。</p>
<p>忽然下了一個焦雷，震破了村中的恬靜，頓時紛擾不堪，許多人家在啼哭，只有没兒子的李老太三阿爹們，僅有女兒的楊老頭張阿水們，家裏纔安靜些。最初，他們是同樣地爲焦雷所震，同樣地失驚，無頭無腦的好似臨到世界末日；後來聽說是抽丁，這纔有了分曉，没兒子和僅有女兒的倒根本免了這層苦痛。但是，楊老頭的女婿却在應抽之列；女兒忽然哭回來；楊老頭一省識，又着急起來了！</p>
<p>楊老頭的女兒乳名小狗，小時候喚慣乳名，大起來也還喚伊狗姑娘。因爲只生了這一個女兒，五歲上又喪了母，就非常溺愛，捨不得嫁出去，打算招一個女婿。可是高的不就，低的楊老頭不肯招，高的又不肯做楊家贅婿　把狗姑娘擱到二十五歲。伊的寡嬸和姑母都主張不能再誤，勸伊的父親變更宗旨，不必定要招婿這纔憑媒說合，計字給同村劉三爺的第二個兒子小牛，成就了牛務因缘。</p>
<p>女婿小牛，恰好和狗姑娘同年，品貌也不壞。就不過臉上有幾粒麻子，但也不怎樣難看。狗姑娘嫁過去纔三個月，頗爲滿意，在父親面前不曾說過有什麽不好。可是楊老頭總以劉三爺有三個兒子爲慮，現在還只妯娌兩個，十四歲的小兒子也娶了親時，做媳婦就不免有點難了。</p>
<p>然而狗姑娘並不慮這些，因爲大嫂子人很好。伊正在飽飯着新婚的甜蜜之酒，不料會遇到抽丁，拉刻要伊的丈夫離開伊到戰塲上去。這一個焦雷，幾乎把伊的魂靈也震了竅了，在家裏哭了一陣，没有法兒，又哭到父親面前來。</p>
<p>「你這樣哭是怎的？有話好說！」楊老頭縐了眉頭問。</p>
<p>「爸爸：你不知道麽？小牛要被人逼着打仗去了，明天就走，爸爸！這是怎麽得了？」狗姑娘說話時，哭聲停了一停，說到末一句，又哭了。</p>
<p>「唔！抽丁抽着小牛了！我方纔也就料到，小牛弟兄三個，自必要抽着一個，此刻小牛怎樣呢？」</p>
<p>「小牛不肯去，無奈城裏的委員不答應，由不得自己。爸爸！你有什麽法子好想麽？」狗姑娘又停了哭，仰面注視楊老頭，兩個浸在涙裏的眸子充滿着希望求援的神氣。</p>

<h3>從盛宣懷說到有理的壓迫</h3>
<p>— 丁萌</p>
<p>盛氏的祖宗積德很厚，他們的子孫就舉行了兩次「收復失地」的盛典：一次還是在袁世凱的民國政府治下，一次就在當今國民政府治下了。</p>
<p>民元的時候，說盛宣懷是第一名的賣國賊，將他的家産没收了。不久，似乎是二次革命之後，就發還了。那是没有什麽奇怪的，因爲袁世凱是「物傷其類」，他自己也是賣國賊。不是年年都在紀念五七和五九嗎？袁世凱簽訂過二十一條，賣國是有眞憑實據的。</p>
<p>最近又在報上發見這麽一段消息，大致是說：「盛氏家産早已奉命歸還，如蘇州之留園，江陰無錫之典當等，正在辦理發還手續」。這却呌我吃了一驚。打聽起來，說是民國十六年國民革命軍初到滬寗的時候，又没收了一次盛氏家産；那次的罪名大概是「土豪劣紳」，绅岊至於「劣」，再加上賣國的舊罪，自然又該没收了。可是爲什麽又發還了呢？</p>
<p>第一，不應當疑心現在有賣國賊，因爲並無眞憑實據丨現在的人早就誓不簽訂辱國條約，他們不比盛宣懷和袁世凱。第二，現在正在募航空捐，足見政府財政並不寛裕。那末，爲什麽呢？</p>
<p>學理上研究的結果是，丨壓迫本來有兩種：一種是有理的，而且永久有理的，一種是無理的。有理的，就像逼小百姓還高利貸，交田租之類；這種壓迫的「理」寫在布告上：「借債還錢本中外所同之定理，租田納稅乃千古不易之成規」。無理的，就是没收盛宣懷的家産等等了；這種「壓迫」鉅紳的手法，在當地也許有理，現在早已變成無理的了。</p>
<p>初初看見報上登載的五一「告工友書」上說：「反抗本國資本家無理的壓迫」，我也是吃了一驚的。這不是提倡階級鬭爭嗎？後來想想也就明白了。這是說，無理的壓迫要反對，而有理的不在此例。至於怎樣有理，看下去就懂得了，下文是說：「必須克苦耐勞，加緊生産…尤應共體時艱，力讛勞資間之眞誠合作，消弭勞資間之一切糾紛」。還有說「中國工人没有外國工人那麽苦」等等的。我心上想，幸而没有大驚小怪地呌起來，天下的事情總是有道理的，一切壓迫也是如此。何况對付盛宣懷等的理由雖然很少，而對付工人總不會没有的。</p>
<h3>無題</h3>
<p>— 趙天任</p>
<p>近來我一看見筆，立刻，無限的懊惱，無限的憤怒，便從心頭浮起。恍惚像一匹曾經受過犰人的鎗擊偶而再看到那兒殘的獵人的野獸一樣，望見筆，我便想逃，便存着敵意。</p>
<p>這，我自己明白，對於筆的仇視，並不是没來由的。確實，幾年來，筆所給予我的創傷和折磨，實在使我不能忍受了。</p>
<p>故鄕的友人們時常寫信來問我究竟在上海做什麽，我有時廉虚地說：「在上海以「筆耕」爲生，」有時竟狂妄而傲慢地答覆：「在上海做文化運動！」只有天纔知道，我究竟在上海做什麽。</p>
<p>生活呆板得像一具機械的轉運，每天早起除了洗臉刷牙而外，第一樁事便是尋找我的筆。我把握着我的筆，緊緊地，我的兩眼，我的注意力，甚至我全身的精力，都集中到筆尖，我的腦汁便從筆尖一點一滴的滲出。這時候我是没有痛楚，甚至没有感覺。因爲我只是一具機器，腦汁的榨出，並不是一種工作，而只是一種義務。</p>
<p>有時，當夜靜月明，我暫時擱下我的筆，像釋下了肩頭的重負一樣，在睡得像一條死蛇樣的馬路上，拖着笨重的兩脚，向我的家奔去。月兒照在當頭，影兒拖在背後，自己底的答脚步聲，把我從一天疲勞中呌醒，「究竟是爲了什麽呢？」我自己問自己，望着寒光逼人的月兒，望着對人擠眉弄眼的星子，我常是只有發出一聲輕微的苦笑。</p>
<p>拿一具機器來作我的譬喻，我想，這是最適當不過的。機器不是没有靈魂的嗎？不是只會按着一定的規律自然地轉運嗎？我呢？人家都說我是一個有靈魂的自由人，我自已似乎也並不覺得我不是一個有靈魂的自由人。但，當我一拿着筆時，疑問便立時在我腦子裏泛起，我是有靈魂的自由人嗎？不想說的偏是不能不說，想說的偏是不能說，我的意志，我的思想，我的自由，這時候便都被幽禁起來。我只是一具喇叭，一隻應聲蟲，甚至一架活動的打字機。記得蕭伯訥曾說過，「在資本主義社會裏，大家都把自已拍賣，女人拍賣的是肉體，而男人拍賣的則是靈魂。」每當更深夜靜，我回想到日間的種種，我便恍惚聽到我的被拍賣的靈魂在向我呌寃訴苦，我恍惚看見我的臉上帶有好幾重面幕，於是我用死力抓我的臉，我慚愧，我悔恨，終至於痛哭。</p>
<p>爲了生活，我拍賣了我的靈魂，爲了生活，我拍賣了我的靑春。我吃自已的腦汁，嚼自己的靈魂，是苦？是澀？也只有自己才知道。天啊，這是生活嗎？　　這樣，我所以每一看見筆，便存着敵意，便想逃，然而，直到現在我每天還是得尋找我的筆，握着，緊緊地。我想，總有一天我得擱下這撈什子，總有一天我得把我的靈魂呌回來。</p>
<h3>丹田</h3>
<p>— 曹聚仁</p>
<p>肚臍下，有一妙處，術名「丹田」　　「丹田」是一個唯一寳貴的所在，抱朴子說：夜半及日中，爲天地生氣之時；趺坐東向，深深呼氣入内，緩緩送入丹田，然後緩緩吐出。初學時引氣入鼻中，本數息觀，以數一二三四以至百一二十次時，乃徐徐吐出之，因納氣須較吐氣之量爲微細，故特置鴻毛於鼻上，以檢查其有無動摇，應用此數息觀以至於行，而得保其納氣時，乃始有多少效騐。稽叔夜云：「呼吸吐納，服食養身；形神相親，表裏俱濟。無爲自得，體妙心玄；須可與羨門比壽，王喬爭年。」這個修道秘訣，行之旣久，妙用無窮！</p>
<p>「丹田」以下，還有妙處，據說也與攝生有關；如何攝生？别見房中術，還得請敎葉德輝先生，可惜他已經死了。據上海各報新聞所載，如蘇州老畫家吸處女的甚麽甚麽，上海某老板，吃處男的甚麽甚麽，記者畫聲畫色，鑿然有日；則房中術以外，尙有這和吐納導引相副而行的採補法。曰吐納，曰房中，曰採補，無非要自己得道成仙，至於童男童女的面黄肌瘦，自不在話下。</p>
<p>修道之士又謂說話不可超過喉門關；多言損氣，說話從胸中，或從腹中出，必且大喪元氣，這個攝生之訣，與呼吸法，恰正相反，一求其深入，一求其淺出，各得妙用。又悲怒之情，足以摇動元神；得道之士，臉上總是笑嘻嘻的，有彌勒佛爲證。說來說去，歸根結底，總以培養「丹田」爲首要。</p>
<p>前人云：「一子得道，鷄犬皆仙」，「丹田」之不可不導引採補以培養之有如此者。或曰：「余常奔走京滬平津粤閩湘鄂之間，所遇「面孔笑嘻嘻，說話口腔裏」者亦多矣，何也？」曰：「是皆得道之士也丨修合雖無人見，存心自有天知！是皆得道之士也！」</p>
<h3>有時</h3>
<p>— 林微音</p>
<p>寛恕我吧，上帝，請你收回我所有的熱，我所有的光，」太陽這樣宛轉地哀求着。</p>
<p>自被造以來，已不知歷了多少歲月，太陽總是一動都不動地站在那里。可是，他所感到討厭的不只是自己的一動都不動的站，還有地球的一息都不停的轉；因爲，要是没有那轉，也許他不至會感到他的站的無聯。而且地球又轉得那麽單調，那麽一成不變。要是他自己能轉的話，他相信，他一定能轉出一些花樣來。有時他氣得不看地球，閉着眼，緊緊地。可是一張眼，又看到了地球，又看到了地球的轉。</p>
<p>「哦，不倦地轉着的地球啊，你竟這樣地轉不倦！」</p>
<p>有時，他氣憤着自己，讉責着自己：「你這蠢東西，就只會那麽固凝？」於是他用盡了全身的氣力，只想打一個旋。可是没有絲毫的效騐。</p>
<p>「儘這樣生活下去有什麽意思呢？」他對於生活起了懷疑。「要是只能這樣生活，我寧可不生活，」他下了最後的决定。</p>
<p>可是他依舊那麽固凝地站着，只發散着熱，只發散着光。終於，他看到他自已是没有什麽希望了，便喊出了毁滅自我的生命的呼求：</p>
<p>「我寛恕我吧，上帝，請你收回我所有熱，所有的光。」</p>
<h3>紅蘿蔔鬚</h3>
<p>— julesrenard作林取譯</p>
<p>洗澡（續）</p>
<p>「是啦，」紅蘿蔔鬚說，「雖然我並不十分歡喜幹這事。水留在我的耳朶裏面，我會要頭痛的。」</p>
<p>他找一個能够學習游泳的地方，這即是說找尋一個地方能夠划動他的手臂，而同時讓他的兩膝跪在砂上前進。</p>
<p>「你太性急了，」雷辟克對他說。「你不要像拔頭髮一樣，握緊兩隻拳頭亂閙。係應當把你那兩條擱着不用的腿子也動一動呀。」</p>
<p>「游泳而不用腿子是更加困難呢，」紅蘿蔔鬚說。</p>
<p>可是大哥斐利克斯時常打擾他，使得他不能一心從事。「紅蘿蔔鬚，到這裏來。這裏比較深一點。我的兩脚踏不到底了，我沉下去。看啦。喂：你現在還看見我。當心啦：你現在看我不到了。現在，你站到柳樹那邊去。不要動。我可以打賭：祗要划六下就可划到你那兒。」</p>
<p>「我替你數着。」紅蘿蔔鬚打着冷戰說。兩肩露出水面，一動不動的好像一塊眞正的界碑。他從新蹲下水去預備游泳。但在哥斐利克斯爬在他背上，一個觔斗射入水裏，對他說道：「現在輪着你啦，如果你願意，你可以爬在我的背上。」</p>
<p>「讓我安安靜靜總習游泳罷。」紅蘿蔔鬚說。</p>
<p>「好啦，」雷辟克呌說，「你們出來，到這裏喝一點糖酒。」</p>
<p>「就要喝酒了！」紅蘿蔔鬚說。</p>
<p>現在他簡直不願意出來了。他還没有充分游泳過。他現在要離去的河水已不使他害怕了。剛才像鉛一樣沉重，現在却像羽毛一樣輕快。他勇猛無比的冒着危險在水裏面掙扎着，他像準備犧自已的生命去援救什麽人一樣，並且他甚至心甘情願沉没在水裏，以便領略那些投水自殺的人們的苦悶。</p>
<p>「快點來啦，」雷辟克呌說，「不然大哥斐利克斯會把糖酒通通喝去啦。」</p>
<p>紅蘿蔔鬚雖然並不喜歡糖酒，他却說道：</p>
<p>「我的那份是决不讓把人家的。」</p>
<p>他像一個飽經戰陣的兵士一樣把酒喝下了。</p>
<p>雷辟克丨你的澡没有洗得乾淨，你的脚踝上還留着污垢。</p>
<p>紅蘿蔔鬚丨這是泥土，爸爸。</p>
<p>雷辟克丨不，這是污垢。</p>
<p>紅蘿蔔鬚丨那麽我再下去洗一洗好嗎，爸爸？</p>
<p>雷辟克丨明天洗好了，我們還要再來的。</p>
<p>紅蘿蔔鬚丨那要靠運氣啦！要天氣好才會再來呢！</p>
<p>他用指尖拈着大哥斐利克斯揩濕了的那魂毛巾的乾角揩着身體，他頭腦沉重，喉嚨苦澀，當他的哥哥和雷辟克拿他那些彎縮着的脚指狠有趣的開着頑笑的時候，他便哈哈大笑。　　（更正）昨日紅蘿蔔鬚二十八行「蘋菓種」係「蘋菓糖」之誤植。</p>

<h3>救國與救心</h3>
<p>— 定華</p>
<p>自從日人侵佔東省以來，因爲愛國同胞的衆多，所以社會上盛傳的救國方法，也隨之而層出不窮日新月異，什麽游藝救國啊，捐欵救國啊，眞是書不勝書，記不勝記，甲說：中國如果要去抵抗日本，一定先要開發國中的富源，使經濟不虞缺乏，才可以安心抗敵，而没有後顧之憂，乙主張，中國如果要抵禦外侮，一定先要擴充軍備，内却說，購製大量飛機，訓練航空人才，方是禦侮的惟一捷徑，也有人在提議；整頓中國海軍的，各存各的主張，各發各的妙論，但是這一大把的救國方針，到底眞能救中國麽？</p>
<p>我人試仔細想想，萬一中國的富源之開發成了事實，中國果然很富庶了，但是誰曉得這班執大權，握國政的，肯不再唯利是圖，互相爭權奪利，而能利用經濟的充足，去從事於禦侮，和盚或的工作？恐怕它的結果，也只是替要人們，增加大宗放在外國銀行裏的存欵，和多行出幾條苛捐雜稅來罷了。至於以擴充軍備而論，就算能有一日，中國的海陸空都成了勁旅，各式各樣的槍械，都造得非常精明，但是誰敢保得定這班握軍權的，肯一致槍口向外，不再操同室之戈。恐怕他們一旦又火併起來，因爲槍械的精明，士卒的强勁，我們老百姓所受的痛苦，比以前和現在，還要厲害上好幾倍呢；這樣一來，國事更形糟糕之不暇，還談得到什麽禦侮，什麽救國？</p>
<p>所以在目前的中國，它所急切需要的，還是「救心」丨張學良爲什麽不抵抗？湯玉麟爲什麽棄熱而逃？胡立夫爲什麽肯做漢奸？溥儀爲什麽肯做日人的傀儡？關内人民爲什麽眼看關外同胞的受苦而不加援手？這許多事情，爲的都不外乎當事者的心，有了毛病，或是起了畸形的變化，所以要禦侮，要救國，一定要從救心着手！</p>
<p>所謂救心也者，就是小而言之；把懶惰的心，化做勤勞，把不抵抗心的，化做抵抗，把只顧私利的心，化做只顧公利，把勇於内戰的心，化爲勇於禦侮。大而言之，把四萬萬顆不同的心，化而爲一，到了那時，人人肯本着良心做事，内戰消除，各業興旺，以之禦侮，何侮不除。以之攻敵，何敵不摧。</p>
<p>「哀莫大於心死」在目前的中國，救心工作至少要比其他救國方針來得急切，需要，和有效些！</p>

<h3>五月</h3>
<p>— 炎</p>
<p>五月寥寥三一日，痛心紀念居其七，如臨大敵禦勞工，爲避强鄰先士卒，魯國城邊慘白寒，南京路上鮮紅溢，休提五七九傷心，一月之中三屈膝，　　無綫電</p>
<p>景象依稀似太平，家家遠播管絃聲，今朝有樂今朝奏，莫待國亡曲不成，</p>
<h3>悲觀和樂觀</h3>
<p>— 錦質</p>
<p>在混亂的時期，悲觀的念頭最容易發生與傳染。我們一覺到社會的或個人的某種不安，即會長呼一聲：「人生太無意味」丨實在說來，我們都是一此麻木不仁的人，否則，在這種不平的環境中，那一種不使我們痛心疾首？我們現在好像在死屍滿堆的墳塲中旅行，所見所聞，非悲即慘。悲慘的景象，非筆墨所能形容的。四圍的一切皆是窄狹私利，和卑鄙的幻影。人們再不相信理想了，眼前利好像就是一般人的理想和行爲的動機。是非的問題是不成問題的，所成問題的就是有利和無利的問題。有利的我去做，無利的無論怎樣高尙的理想或事業，我是决不贊成的。這就是最近那些號稱向前進的人的内心思想。這種情形怎不使人悲觀呢？難怪飄浮浪漫的生活不成時髦的生活。「飄浮啊！我現在無異乎大海中的浮萍，乘風飄浮，不知彼岸何方？」所謂新詩人時常總有這種類似的句子。「我厭惡人生了！我情願到無人跡之鄕過着淸淨自由的生涯。人生太醜惡了，何處有我善美的樂士？我願求我的樂土呵！我願與這萬惡的人間隔絶！！永遠見不到像動而又不像動物，號稱「萬物之靈」的人類！」我們做起文章來，能寫出這些句子，一定可以得到大衆的同情。是的，一切人都在大海中沐浴，煩惱是現世的流行症，人們想脫離煩惱，所以常發出那些的呼聲。一切人都願意快樂的，一切人都不想在苦痛中扎掙的，但是苦痛却常伴着他們，一步不離的扼住他們的咽喉。難怪他們不在悲觀道上奔馳呀！</p>
<p>在悲觀者的眼中，一切人都是惡的，人類社會是無法改造的。他們常笑社會理想家多事，常以革命者爲狂人。「人生是苦痛的自然史」，「生存就是惡的」，世界的哲學家如此的告訴我們。但是我們旣然生在世間了，我們這樣咀呪人生就可以了事嗎？我們就此厭惡人</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>生麽？我們就没有方法在苦痛中求得減少苦痛的靈丹嗎？悲觀有何用呀！我們還是及早向前進吧！悲觀者，請放下煩悶的心，努力向改善生活的路上直趨吧！長呈短嘆和隱居山林，到底無濟於事。</p>
<p>現世的特權者在偏面的快樂中過慣了生活，時常帶着赤色眼鏡，以爲人生是最可祝福的。苦痛嗎？悲哀嗎？他們雖有時家庭的不和與投機事業的失敗等而有苦痛悲哀，然而普通總以社會改造者替窮苦者鳴不平爲無病呻吟；在他們的心目中，世上一切人好像都與他們一樣的快樂，幸福，破壞他們的安逸，是大逆不道的！此即俗語所謂「有己肚飽，不知人饑！」美人呀！佳釀呀！高車呀！怒馬呀！應有盡有，怎樣說人生是苦痛的？</p>
<p>這些人是無知無覺的豬一般的樂天主義者！他們對於人生是極其樂觀的。因爲他們是聾子，聽不見悲慘的人間的哭聲。</p>
<p>但是，另外有些人有一種特别的思想，以爲人類的一切都是善的惡到十二分的事物，在他們看來也是善的表示。他們雖不是特權者，却也不厭惡人生。他們目一切現象都是自然賜與，我們不要多思多慮，只要聽天由命的生活下去，結果好歹，用不着我們多事。好的目會好，壞的，你憂慮死也没有用的：所以還不如實行「今朝有酒今朝醉，明日無錢明日愁」的主張，倒澈底得多。這此人現社會也是多得無以復加。我們無以名之，名之曰糊塗的莫名其妙的樂觀者。</p>
<p>這些人也是革命的敵人，他們覺得革命要擾他們享樂的淸夢，還不如超然的在醉鄕中苟活好。如果人類的將來是好的，自然用不着我們像煞有介事的努力，也會好的。所以馬馬虎虎一點吧！他們就以馬馬虎虎爲標語，什麽事都可馬馬虎虎四字了之。可憐呀！馬馬虎虎主義者！</p>
<p>人生可以樂觀嗎？那裏容我們樂觀呢？我們只要看目下現象，就會愁容滿面了。</p>
<p>悲觀？樂觀？我們仔細的去考察人類，覺得人類中實在用不到悲觀與樂觀。人們有善也有惡，有建設也有破壞，有高尙也有卑鄙，總之，進化的道路上是要人們去開拓的。</p>
<h3>牢籠生活</h3>
<p>— 延昭</p>
<p>幾間中國舊式房子，簷前擺佈着粗笨的木栅，室内光線不很充足；不但不充足，簡直是黑暗。室内的人，横七豎八的滿望着，連角落裏都在擁擠。他們一個個都很憔悴，髮兒蓬鬆得像秋季的野草，肌膚黄瘦得像落地的敗葉；他們的面容，彷彿在含涙欲滴，一種厭倦抑鬱憂慮悲憤的情狀，不喻可知。他們的身體，似乎很管力，手足也很軟弱；有幾個的脚踝上，還繫着笨重的鐡鏈，更走不來路，這大概是罪孽比較重些的人了。</p>
<p>整個的房間裏，充滿着惡氛，這也許是在過牢籠生活的人所以没有生氣的原因·這裏，籠圍是這樣的小，地方是這樣的污穢，人是這樣的擁擠，生活是這樣的不自由，那得不演成頽唐沮喪，以致奄奄瞑目而若死呢！</p>
<p>他們的吃喝，旣談不到山珍海味；而藜藿菜羹，也難依着你的肚子，嚼個大飽。更甚的是晚上，照理本可安睡片刻，養一養他們過於疲乏困頓的體魄和精神，然而同牛毛一樣多的蟊賊，又來叨擾了丨丨老百虱不顧你的死活，一口鉗住你，死也不放，盡力吃吸你們的寳貴的血，直吸得飽而又飽，然後悄悄地躱進衣襟逢裏去；跳蛋敏捷地運用那天賦的跳躍本能，跳進大塊頭的胸脯，再跳進小夥計的臂部，輾轉又跳到老頭子的腿上，跳來跳去，跳遍了整個的牢籠，吸盡了所有的人的身上的鮮血；狡猾的臭虫，更若人惡，更鬼祟而辣潑，它每至宵深人靜，偷偷地打地板逢中鑽出來，來擾攘他們的夢寐，牛飲他們的朱殷。他們不能再忍耐了，將身子用力地跳將起來，哀哀地哭了。而　們誰也不會憐憫，依然在他們身上肌内，剥削那腥紅的血。</p>
<p>栅外站着威嚴赫赫的獄卒，炯炯的目光，注視栅内，旣不許你說話，更不許你動彈，要是你偶然說了一聲，立刻他會叱然吆喝，嚇得你魂飛九宵，倘或有幾個胆量較大的人，還想多說句說話，他會奉送你一頓又重又痛的大棍子。</p>
<p>他們無歲無月，無早無暮，幽此牢中，旣看不見靑天，又望不到日月，黯沉沉，陰霾霾，渡着那撲朔迷離的光陰。言論旣自由不得，思想也無從自由，行動更不得自由，如兀坐檻穽之中，捱那拘束生涯。丨丨生之難能，死之不能。</p>
<p>聽說，這裏的牢籠，便是我們的貴國，那牢籠裏的人們，也一定就是貴國的同胞了；牢籠中的生活，自然即是同胞們的生活。</p>
<p>啊！同胞……牢籠……生活……</p>

<h3>人到什麽時候才算老？</h3>
<p>— 佩</p>
<p>一個人到什麽時候才算老呢？</p>
<p>史各德（ＳＩＲＷＡＬＴＥＲＳＣＯＴＴ）在五十五歲的時候，嘆息他自自己成了一個老人。法國文學家孟太格（ＭＯＮＴＡＩＧＮＥ）三十人歲時，便退休於其别墅，過他靜穆的讀書生活。英國文學家約翰遜博士（ＤＲＳＡＭＵＥＬＪＯＨＮＳＯＮ說：一個人到了三十五歲，便到了一生的極峯，以後便要走下山路了。按生理學說，人可以活一百歲到一百五十歲，然則爲什麽史各德等人那麽點年紀，便算老了呢？回答是：因爲他們覺得老，所以他們的行爲老了。生理學者威廉傑姆斯，（ＷＩＴＬ　　　　Ｊ　　　）</p>
<p>Ｓ）說，「大多數的人，到二十五歲便成了落伍的老松。」這話是眞個把握住眞理了。人到二十五歲多半已滿足於他們的職業；他們已有了「偏見」，就是所謂「主義」，而拒絶一切新的觀念了；他們已經停止了「生長」。</p>
<p>一個人只要一停止生長，不管他年紀大小，他便開始「老」了。在另一方面，眞正偉大的人，永遠没有一個老。意國畫家提丹（ＴＩＴＩＯＮ）他活到九十九歲，没有歇過畫。歌德（ＧＯＥＴＨＥ）八十三歲逝世，他完成那偉大的「浮士德」，距死没有數年。格萊斯東（ＧＬＡＤＳＴＯＮＥ）七十歲的時候，還要學一種外國文。法國大算低家萊普萊士（ＬＡＰＬＡＣＥ）七十八歲逝世的時候，尙在工作。他臨死時呼道：「我們所知道的，算不得什麽東西，我們不知道的，正多着呢！」人什麽時候才算老？這你就得着眞正的回答了。萊普萊士七十作歲的時候還是不滿足，確信世間的學問還有無限；他還在一生長」；他便仍然是一個靑年！一個人能保持這種態度，每一年回顧過去能夠說一聲，「我長了！」，他便是一個靑年。那一天他不再長了，他對自已說：「我所需要的智識，我已經完全獲得了。」丨他的靑年時代便算消近了。不管他是二十五歲或者是七十五歲，那一點分别没有，那一天起，他便算是眞個個老了</p>

<p>拖人下水</p>
<p>編者先生；</p>
<p>當我未將我的困難，求你解决前，先把我的家中情形說一說。我有一位老母，兩個弟弟，兩個妹妹。我是老大，今年念四歲；父親是在去年「一二八」戰裏，做了犧牲品了。他在世時，每月的薪水，好有三百多元；因此一家的開支，以及弟妹的學費，是不愁的。他去世後，我！不幸的老大丨就要一個人挑此重担。我雖是一個中學畢業生，目下在一家公司裏當小職員，月薪卅元。三十元與三百元，不是差了很多嗎？拿來支持一家的日用，已是十分困難，况且又要供給弟弟的學費，（一個高中二，一個還是小學生）眞所謂難之又難了。照母親的主意，想呌大的弟弟去做事；但我想一個人至少要受過中學敎育，才能有普通常識，以立身於社會，所以仍極力主張他繼續讀書，雖然我的力量很薄。</p>
<p>現在我來講我的困難罷。我公司裏的同事，一個個都是花花公子，不是吃花酒，就是賭錢。有一次，他們呌我加入，被我拒絶了。因此他們懷恨在心，處處尋我的不是，向經理報告；他們的用意，是一種警告，凡是他們的命令，都不許加以拒絶。唉！照他們這種行爲，論理我做朋友的，應當去勸他，不聽，我應當報告給經理。現在我是一個弱者，爲了要保全這一只一家六口所籍以過活的飯碗，已經取了不抵抗主義。他們似乎應當滿足；爲什麽定要拖人下水呢？照這樣下去，遲早我的地位是要不保的了。想到這裏，實在使人寒心；先生，你能指示一條光明大道，給我一點奮鬥力嗎？祝你</p>
<p>健康邵飛謹上</p>
<p>Ｘ　Ｘ　Ｘ</p>
<p>編者按：邵君的家庭，三十元一月，維持家用，的確已是十分困難了。至於一個人立身社會，學問當然是必不可少的。你的弟弟，現在已經高中二年，再過一年，就可高中畢業，告一段落。你主張他繼續求學，直到中學畢業，實在是對的。至於學費一層，你能夠張羅最好；否則不妨舉債以成之。爲了正當的學費，不得已而舉債，在人家呢，大概不致於拒絶；在你呢，這筆債，將來不妨呌你的弟弟同負償還的責任。你這種苦心籌劃的經過，也要呌你弟弟得知；這並不是一定將來要他還債的張本，同時一方面，也好呌他得知物力的艱難，用心向上。</p>
<p>至於你與同事間的問題，我們勸你不必過慮。他們所以定要拖人下水，無非是做賊心虚，恐怕你不但不胡調，或者還要說他們的不是。你旣經抱着不抵抗主義，日子一久。亭種心跡，他們知道之後，也就可相安無可了。你祗須認眞辦事，力免錯誤，在用人者方面，即使没有勇氣肅淸花花公子，或者他自已也是花花公子，終不致絶對不能容你呢！</p>
<p>末了我們對於邵君的同事們，與其他處所的花花公子，也要提一個最低限度的要求：「你們自己雖不能束身自愛，至少對於束身自好的人，不要再拖人下水：你們要知道即使使放鬆了他們，與你究有無害呢？」</p>

<h3>五姬的一生（五）（續）</h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>五第一個方顧</p>
<p>不管這世界對於她們是怎樣的嘲弄，然而柳姑娘終於長大起來了。在她，這悠久的歲月，對於她好像是做夢的似的，她到底是怎樣長成起來的，自己也覺得不點茫然，也許是她有意要儘可能的忘失，因爲她常愛說：「這算得什麽，還不是這麽一回事」，接着是嘴角一歪，鼻子裏哼出一聲苦笑。這種事，在多情善感的仁兄看來，是很可以爲她落涙的，可是久而久之，也就不覺得奇特，似乎人們都不免要如此的。其實，我們的柳姑對於自己是不大願意了解的，即如常時有許多嫖客們樓着她的腰肢，很傷感的讚美她說：</p>
<p>「我的小寳貝，你不知道你是長得多麽美麗啊！眞夠使我發瘋了。」</p>
<p>「眞的嗎？謝謝！不過，像這樣的話，我已經聽過幾百遍了。」</p>
<p>像這樣的回答，是很可以令人不安的，但是有多少太好了的男人却並不以爲這樣的話是撞傷了自己，而且要更誠懇的捧出一顆熱騰騰的心；這一顆心，必須要以黄金質的盒子盛置着而擺在她的梳裝臺上陳列着，成爲她所至愛的寳物。</p>
<p>至於在她自己，對於這些早已非常明白，旣然是個妓女，當然會有各色各樣的嫖客糾纏着在她的周圍，擺不脫的，而且也就用不着擺脫。他們所給她的是錢的滿足，她所給與他們的是色與肉的滿足，彼此交換，十分合理。何况自己巳到了成熟的年齡，所以章大爺說是一定要給她梳頭，也就隨他罷。反正少不了要經過這樣的一次，那一個男人都是很好的對手，只看誰能夠和她的鴇母講好價錢罷了。</p>
<p>關於章大爺的身世，就是武貴也不大弄得明白。據說他那時確是個遇缺即放的候補知事，他的表兄是現任道尹。然而這一點在她都没有關係，不過最使她高興的便是除了一雙三兩重的金手鐲之外還有兩粒很大的珍珠，這些都是馬上可以到手的。在她的意思還想向他一隻金頸圈，前面吊一塊綠玉，那在别人面前是很夠體面的。</p>
<p>關於這些，經過了幾天的談判，因爲章大爺很慷慨的原故，很快的便完全妥貼了，只待定製的幾樣木器，都搬進了自己的房間，以後便可以大大的熱閙一番。日期早已選定了三月初六。</p>
<p>從此，她便不再是淸官人了。（未完）</p>

<p>以世界的歌國丨意大利名曲爲骨幹</p>
<p>音樂，歌聲，山光，水色，花香，詩意，羅曼斯丨宇宙間一切的美，一切天造地設的美，可以說統統奇妙的收入壓倒一切聲片的「春江花月夜」裏面去了。在美國電影事業没落的今日，高孟不列顚影片公司能夠抓住歡洲民族的特色别出心裁的把　發揮出來，這種非常的成功是値得我們熱忱的稱贊的。從前歐洲影片不爲人所歡迎的風氣可因「春江花月夜」的藝術無疑的爲之一變。</p>
<p>「春江花月夜」的導演，表演，攝影，取景，收音丨一切都成功到出神入化的境地。音樂的曼妙和歌唱的婉轉無容說更是本片的特點，不是一切有聲影片所能望其項背。我們讀到天才作家的一部小說或一首詩常會欣賞到心曠神怡得變成了另一個人似的，我們看過「春江花月夜」的影片也發生同樣的美感。「春江花月夜」是提高觀衆的嗜好的傑作。</p>
<p>「春江花月夜」情節很簡單然而含意很深長，曲曲折折演映出來眞有山窮水盡又一村的美妙。牠的含意是描寫奔放不覊的天才丨片裏的意大利大歌家富拉樂丨以及諷剌呌人好笑的市儈　片裏的市長潘特格。一切有天才的大文豪，大詩人，大藝術家，大歌劇家，都須得着絶對的自由，他的天才纔能發揮出來。有天才的人不能借重市儈，市儈也不能覊縻天才；否則天才就不成其爲天才，即使是天才也就此永遠埋没了。本片裏的意大利天才歌家富拉樂起初受女經理束縛而鬱鬱不樂。他中途脫逃之後，又遇着市長的纏擾，便將錯就錯，竟使其秘書頂替自己以免麻煩！這是天才不好名而愛孤獨的描寫。</p>
<p>這天才歌家施了個金彈脫殼之計，他把兩扇大門慢慢地關上的一幕便成了還我自由的分水嶺。此後他便獨往獨來的遨游於歐洲的花園丨瑞士的山之麓水之涯。影片裏就映出山水如畫。美麗的河山自然地成爲天才的故鄕了。更爲此富有詩意帶着浪漫性的佳境遇着如花美眷，這意大利歌家便在山水交接的一角僻壤，在活潑天眞的一羣村童中間，引吭高歌，奔放其洋溢的天才。在這裏山明水秀烏語花香溶化得天衣無縫，觀衆一定也會淘醉在這音樂化的電影藝術裏了　　意大利是世界有名的歌國。春江化月夜的歌曲雖是近作，在本片的序幕裏借着無線電播音唱着悠悠蕩蕩法很悅耳，這只歌曲的調子在以後幾幕裏絡續做着配襯的言樂。影片的後半部便把意大利古典歌劇裏幾支不配的哥曲，如藜茄藜托和特拉維亞泰，接連的借着姬普拉的歌喉唱着，更以拉婆希迷一曲爲總結束，使觀衆在一部影片欣賞着三支名曲，眞是不可多得的機會，何况在本片之前還聽到德國大音樂家貝陀芬的交響曲。</p>
<h3>評「兩秒鐘」ＴＷＯＳＥＣＯＮＤＳ</h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>無疑義的，這是一部模糊羣衆意識和作品。</p>
<p>建築工人約翰於工作之餘，去跳無塲尋歡，得識舞女雪蘭，在酒醉朦朧的時候，倉卒間與她結婚。及後他亦因惱怒妻的浪漫而悮死一至好的友人，自己亦受了傷。當他臥病的時候，窮極潦倒，一切日用均仰給於妻。由於妻的自白，而始知這些錢均得自她的情人，不勝其羞憤。但他僥倖得了一筆巨欵，於是償債於妻的情人而將其擊死。到後來自首法庭，服法。</p>
<p>很明顯的，本劇的ＳＣＥＮＡＲＩＯＷＲＩＴＥＲ在這裏用盡心思的創作了一個剛毅正直而有血性的典型的工人；而這個工人，他必須不至於認識了本身之出路，對於自身的經濟壓迫，雖然在十分苦痛的時候，也不會懷疑這現實的社會制度是否合理，甚至於出於不得已而實行殺人的時候，仍然决心服法。自然，這種典型的人物，對於上層組織的人們乃是非常有利的。所以約翰在意識錯亂的情形之下，居然有牧師會在他頗有進賬的條件之下，而證明他對於這位舞女確有愛　，直到後來居然也不反對這婚約之有　。其後因病而失業，雖然是幾臨絶境但是亦不要求撫卹金或醫藥費，而且　爲愛情超越一切，恥於妻子的賣淫。　時欠了賬，必須還賬，没有辦法，可以「孤注一擲」的買彩票。（並且居然就中</p>
<p>烏發新片「離婚理由」，明天（星期四）起映於新光大戲院，係一極含有幽默情調而切中時弊的音樂滑稽片。描寫久經世故的丈夫和初入情塲的處女底一切情境，惟妙惟有肖。關於導演，攝影方面，亦頗有很多的新貢獻，確不失爲一部佳作。</p>
<p>了。）當然，有了錢，必須還賬，先還賬而後殺人，殺了人，自然就得服法而無恐。而且在死前應當大大的懺悔，這樣便是「英雄」，這樣便是被正人君子所歌頌的「好人」，這樣便是工人羣衆最好的模範。所以編劇者在銀幕上創造了這個十分合乎情理的典型人物，而這個人物也便是維護現代法度的最好的犧牲者</p>
<p>如上所述，這一個典型人物在花費了許多ＦＩＬＭ的條件之下，必須成爲一個說敎的工具。但是這也不是十分容易的事情，假如要使廣大的觀衆，接收這種麻醉的話，於是必須要有好的技巧，表演和導演都要十分動人。關於這一點。正是「兩秒鐘」的諸作者所努力做到了的。他們總算忠實的盡了他們的「責任」。</p>

<h3>電影小說秘密（ＳＥＳＲＥＴＳ）（四）</h3>
<p>— 開羅</p>
<p>過了多少時候，曼麗已是美國西部鄕村中的一位少婦。小約翰也已出世了。他們住的房子是一所小木屋，内分二小室，還有一只壁爐。裏面原始時代式的傢私，統通是約翰親手做成的。泥地上鋪的牛皮以及小約翰睡的摇床，亦是約翰的手澤。曼麗有時想到從前在新英格蘭時候的少女生活，但亦不覺得什麽留戀與悔恨。她是崇拜現實戀愛生活的。他認從前她對於戀愛，祗有空洞的幻想，而現在可是充滿甜味地實現了。她有約翰，還有小約翰。　　她俯伏在小約翰的摇床上面，逗着小約翰玩着。她對他說：「你將來長大了，比你父親還要偉大。你父親將來作這一省的省長，但是你，你要作大統。明白嗎？大總統。</p>
<p>她這樣地逗着小約翰玩，忽然聽見窗外遠處一陣馬蹄聲。約翰和他的助手呌沈香的，那天一早到隣村去採辦食品去了。能這麽早就回來嗎？她再聽了一回，馬蹄聲越走越近，她奔向大門，把門開直了。然後她的臉沉下去了。三個面目猙狞的男子下了馬。她害怕地向後退了幾步。三人中的領袖走上前來，向着曼麗道「你好，我是傑克郝塞，人家都稱我「紅臉傑克」恐怕你亦聽見過。」</p>
<p>曼麗的臉變了慘白色。她說「我聽見過。」</p>
<p>「我們是來尋些東西吃的，」那人獰笑着說。</p>
<p>「你不要白費時候，我有東西，亦不能喂偷牛賊！」她說完了，拿門用力一推，用鐡拴　上了。但是等到她要關那一面小窗的時候，一隻毛毛已經伸了進來，砰的一聲，一顆彈子已經飛掠而過。曼麗連忙奔過了抱住她的孩子，那孩子還是笑着。外面的强盜喊着「我們要東西吃，我勸你還是乖乖地開門吧。」曼麗抱着孩子，慢慢把門開了。紅臉傑克還介紹那兩位；一位是他的兄弟呌竇甫，一位呌彼得。他們强迫曼麗將一切食物取了出來。他們大嚼的時候，　甫不時斜睨着這鄕村中的見着的美貌女子。但他的形狀，被傑克覺察了，他說「竇甫，這次不興，你下次再回來好了。」</p>
<p>他們吃完了，忽然又有一個人跑了進來，向着傑克道：「老總，牛都已圈起來了。」曼麗聽了，跳了起來問道：「牛？誰家的牛？」（未完）</p>

<h3>日蘇糾紛與蘇聯出賣中東路實</h3>
<p>Japan is taking advantage of the deepening global economic panic and our nation's plight due to natural and man-made disasters. Disregarding international trust, Japan has resorted to military force to seize our Northeast Three Provinces, Jehol, and Eastern Hebei, all suffering immense calamity. Even Chahar, Tianjin, and Beiping are gripped by the terror of Japanese imperialist aggression. Consequently, peace in the Far East has been utterly destroyed, and the international equilibrium has been completely undermined. Our diplomatic policy of hoping the League of Nations would uphold justice has utterly failed. At the same time, British and American interests in China are also threatened, and the world economy is suffering significant indirect repercussions.</p>
<p>The United States of America, angered by the rampant brutality of Japanese imperialism and lamenting the impending fragmentation of the Chinese market, is preoccupied with stabilizing its finances and unable to look westward. Thus, it initially planned to restore diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union, severed for fifteen years, to jointly restrain Japan economically and politically, preventing it from becoming excessively reckless. However, due to the deteriorating relations between Britain and the Soviet Union and the potential for temporary coordination between Britain and the United States, and because the United States urgently needs the aid of the British Empire on international issues such as war debts, currency, and trade, the resumption of U.S.-Soviet relations has been postponed in favor of seeking understanding with Britain. Furthermore, if Britain and the United States can align their actions and reach a temporary compromise, France would likely not raise objections. In this way, without any military bloodshed, a relative economic blockade would be more than sufficient to force Japan to submit. Although Japan claims to be self-sufficient with its "Japan-Manchuria Economic Alliance," it is a light industry nation lacking cotton production and having limited capacity to absorb silk. Over 70% of its oil comes from foreign sources, and 90% of its steel raw materials and iron ore are imported. These four factors alone make Japan vulnerable to economic sanctions. Therefore, Japan is shifting its aggression, challenging the Soviet Union over the China Eastern Railway detention issue before the completion of the Jihui Railway and Yanji-Sanxing Railway. In reality, Japan has no genuine intention of going to war; it merely seeks to ingratiate itself with Britain and the United States, hoping to alleviate the economic blockade implied by Britain and further its aggression against our country.</p>
<p>The international relations of the Northeast Three Provinces were originally quite complex, with the triangular rivalry between China, the Soviet Union, and Japan being particularly prominent. When the Northeast regime belonged to our country, despite our weakness, we were undoubtedly one of Japan's hypothetical enemies. Thus, the Soviet-Japanese conflict was buffered by our country, preventing direct confrontation. In other words, the China Eastern Railway was able to exist virtually unscathed despite being surrounded by imperialist powers. Now that our Northeast governance has been seized by the Japanese, the Soviet Union faces difficulties. Firstly, economically, Dalian is the port for exporting South Manchurian goods. The products of western Heilongjiang are also absorbed by Dalian through the connection of the Tao'an-Ang'angxi and Siping-Tao'an railways. The Jilin agricultural products and the Heilongjiang river basin granary were originally the goals of the China Eastern Railway's development. Once the Jihui Railway is completed and the Yanji-Sanxing line is built, Qingjin and Unggi ports will surround Vladivostok and control its maritime access. Consequently, the China Eastern Railway will have the simple task of connecting Europe and Asia through the Siberian Railway, losing its maneuvering power militarily. Moreover, the Soviet Union, at this juncture, seeks to adopt a detached attitude, observing the unfolding contradictions among imperialist countries while continuing its traditional peaceful policy to consolidate its past constructions. If the China Eastern Railway is sealed off by Japan, using the name of a puppet regime and military force, the Soviet Union, lacking the resolve to resolve it with an iron fist, will have no effective means to deal with this barbaric action. The U.S.-Soviet relations have not been restored, and the Anglo-Soviet relations are estranged, putting the Soviet Union in a disadvantageous position. Therefore, the Soviet Union is willing to make political sacrifices, claiming it will sell the China Eastern Railway to temporarily alleviate the current tension, while demanding a huge price of 300 million gold rubles to deter Japan. Its tactics are extremely astute.</p>
<p>However, from a legal standpoint, the Soviet Union cannot sell the China Eastern Railway unilaterally without our country's consent. According to the Sino-Soviet agreement, the China Eastern Railway is a joint Sino-Soviet enterprise. The Soviet Union has no reason to sell it arbitrarily. Therefore, if the talk of the Soviet Union selling the railway is a diplomatic tactic to buy time and alleviate the emergency situation with Japan, we can understand it to some extent. But if the Russians are forced by circumstances and genuinely intend to sell it to Japan, the Soviet Union has disregarded the Sino-Russian relations and violated the previous Sino-Russian agreement. Although the Northeast Three Provinces are forcibly occupied by a Japanese puppet regime, our country is determined to regain them and will not recognize the permanent occupation. How can the Soviet Union sell the sovereignty of the China Eastern Railway, which we have not relinquished? The Soviet government should reflect on this matter.</p>

<p>(Beiping) As a result of the mediation by the military and police, Wu Peifu's bodyguards agreed to hand over seven rifles, 121 carbines, 3,265 rifle bullets, 281 hand grenades, 226 broadswords, and five pairs of hand weights with 67 weight heads on the spot this morning. These were counted and received separately by Fan Naibu, the commander of the military police, and Ma Qingyu, the head of the special operations team of the Public Security Bureau. Unarmed officers and soldiers will be given severance pay and dismissed within the next few days. The authorities have dispatched twenty police officers and military police to watch over Wu's residence. (9th Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Tianjin) At 10 PM on the 6th, another bombing occurred at the Ta Kung Pao office in the French Concession here. A bomb was placed in each of the editorial office, the police office, and the factory. The fuses were also lit. At the critical moment, they were discovered by employees, luckily preventing a major incident. The French Concession authorities believe that the perpetrators are familiar with the situation inside the office. Therefore, the news was forbidden to be reported, and the investigation is being seriously conducted. This is the third time Ta Kung Pao has been bombed. It is generally believed that the perpetrators are members of the State Nationalist Youth Party. (8th Jiji Press)</p>

He was dressed in a red-buttoned hat, peacock feather, embroidered python robe, and large dragon robe, a complete Qing Dynasty attire. Zhang's wives and concubines came to the hospital to take care of the arrangements and transported the coffin back to his private residence. It will soon be placed in Fayuan Temple.

<p>改善白銀地位美對華貿易始能進步</p>
<p>Improving the Position of Silver is Necessary for U.S.-China Trade to Progress</p>
<p>(Washington) Soong Tzu-wen met with President Roosevelt today and had lunch together. Afterwards, they began discussing Eastern economic issues related to China. It is reported that the issue of the Northeast Three Provinces was only part of their discussion. Soong will continue to discuss everything with Secretary of State Hull and State Department officials in the future. It is known that President Roosevelt treated Soong cordially because they are both graduates of Harvard University. (8th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to outside sources, Finance Minister Soong met with Roosevelt on the 8th and began economic talks. However, the talks between Soong and Roosevelt still need to continue several times before a conclusion can be reached. After Finance Minister Soong completes his mission in the United States, he will still go to England to attend the World Economic Conference. In addition to Soong, Gu Weijun and Guo Taiqi will also be appointed as our representatives. This order will be announced soon. (9th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Washington) While Undersecretary of State Phillips was answering inquiries from various parties about the protection of overseas Chinese, President Roosevelt was receiving Chinese Finance Minister Soong Tzu-wen and Chinese Ambassador Shi Zhaoji at the White House to discuss Far Eastern issues and economic matters. Subsequently, Secretary of State Hull and Phillips also joined the discussion. It is understood that President Roosevelt first hosted a banquet at the White House for Minister Soong, Ambassador Shi, and others, and invited several government officials and members of Congress to accompany them. The talks began after the banquet. According to official sources, political stability in the Far East was also one of the topics discussed. It is also reported that the President is prepared to discuss Far Eastern affairs frankly and summarize his views on the necessary conditions for economic stability. Before meeting with Soong and Shi, the President told his advisors that he believes political tranquility is a prerequisite for the recovery of the economies of Europe and other regions. Therefore, it is expected that the President will also discuss this belief when discussing the revival of Far Eastern trade. In addition, the improvement of the coinage status of silver will also be discussed. It is said that the President is particularly eager to learn the impact of raising silver prices on China's domestic and foreign trade. Before Soong went to the White House, the President summoned Senator Pittman, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, for a secret talk. Pittman, a key member of the silver faction, has repeatedly advised the President that improving the status of silver will accelerate the progress of American trade with China. Now Pittman and other silver faction members of Congress will immediately meet with Minister Soong after the President exchanges views with him to inquire about the impact of silver prices on China. Today, the Senate has passed the Weller Resolution, instructing the U.S. representatives at the London Conference to find a way to conclude an international agreement to restore the use of silver as currency. This move is also sufficient to open the door for American dignitaries to discuss silver issues with Chinese representatives. (8th Kuomin Telegram)</p>

<p>The United States Observes the Situation Quietly</p>

<p>全美人士紛請護僑</p>
<p>People Across America Urge Protection of Overseas Chinese</p>
<p>(Washington) Since the news of the Japanese puppet troops re-invading areas within the Great Wall reached the United States, inquiries to the U.S. State Department regarding the protection of the lives and property of American overseas Chinese in North China have been incessant today. Americans with relatives and friends in Beiping and Tianjin have even been asking their state's members of Congress whether the government should send more troops to protect American overseas Chinese. Undersecretary of State Phillips declared to all parties that the United States is currently relying on the long-standing joint defense cooperation plan among the British, French, and Italian troops in North China to provide necessary protection, especially for the protection of the legation quarter. He also stated that U.S. Ambassador to China Johnson has the authority to handle matters regarding the protection of American overseas Chinese at his discretion. Currently, Johnson has not requested additional troops or reported any new defense plans. These matters are the responsibility of the embassy in Beiping and will be handled by the embassy at its discretion. Washington does not remotely control them. It is reported that people across the United States are more anxious about the Japanese troops re-invading areas within the customs than during the Jehol incident. Most of those inquiring at the German State Department today also expressed concern that future disturbances may spread to the Beiping-Tianjin area. However, the news received within the State Department has not caused great anxiety among officials. (8th Guomin Telegram)</p>
<p>羅斯福决親赴倫敦</p>

<p>參加經濟會議</p>
<p>To Participate in the Economic Conference</p>
<p>乘艦奉命準備</p>
<p>The Ship Is Prepared Under Orders</p>
<p>(Washington) After being pressed by journalists for several days, Secretary of the Navy Swanson finally indicated today after a resolute request to announce the purpose of the order regarding the USS Indianapolis cruiser that President Roosevelt has accepted the invitation to travel abroad. All parties here now believe that Swanson's statement is sufficient to confirm the report that the U.S. President will personally attend the London Economic Conference. It is reported that after the White House received the invitation to the conference, the naval aide ordered the USS Indianapolis, docked in the Potomac, to be prepared. Although White House officials denied a few days ago that the President would attend the meeting in England, it is now believed that this was because the President had not yet made a decision. Now that the Secretary of the Navy has announced that the President will travel abroad, although South American countries have also invited the President to travel, it is unlikely that he will accept due to time constraints. However, if he participates in the London Conference, the U.S. President will be able to meet with responsible leaders of various countries, and Congress is scheduled to adjourn on June 1. The President can comfortably attend the meeting before June 12. According to Roosevelt's friends and enemies, this trip will not be like President Wilson's, who faced diplomatic pressure. After the President delivers a speech at the meeting, all other debates can be handled by the chief delegate, Hull. (8th Guomin Telegram)</p>
<p>戰雲不散影響貿易</p>
<p>War Clouds Dispersing Affect Trade</p>
<p>(New York) Several well-known experts in the Wall Street financial community are paying as much attention to the Geneva Disarmament Conference as they are to the London World Economic Conference. According to their opinion, economic nationalism cannot be stopped if the threat of war does not cease. It is precisely the threat of war that has prompted countries to strive for economic self-sufficiency, thereby hindering the flow of trade between countries. France, Germany, and Italy are now offering rewards to encourage farmers to grow wheat, while Canada, the United States, and Argentina have surplus wheat. The world market can supply everything, and its price is much cheaper than the prices maintained by these European countries. Other countries have the same situation for other goods. Now, they intend to find ways to restore world trade so that surplus goods can circulate. This is the hope of the Economic Conference, but if the war clouds do not dissipate, few countries will be willing to rely on foreign markets for goods not produced domestically.

<p>關稅休戰英美妥協</p>
<p>Tariff Truce, British and American Compromise</p>
<p>(London) It is now believed that the proposal for a tariff truce was compromised in principle yesterday after negotiations between U.S. representative Davis and British Trade Minister Runciman, and will be approved by the British Cabinet. The agreed-upon method allows Britain to make exceptions. If the U.S. dollar falls sharply, Britain retains the freedom to take defensive measures. Britain can also continue ongoing trade negotiations, and recently signed treaties will also be effective and not restricted by the tariff truce. The United States seems to focus on obtaining recognition of the principle, and it is acceptable to add various restrictions during implementation. Roosevelt intends to use this to strengthen his position in Congress so that he can obtain full authority on the war debt issue. (9th Havas Telegram)</p>

<p>荷銀行維持金兌現</p>
<p>Dutch Bank Maintains Gold Convertibility</p>
<p>Rumors that the Netherlands would abandon the gold standard occurred in Amsterdam on Saturday and Sunday, causing considerable panic in the stock exchange this morning. But by noon, everyone's mind gradually recovered, because the president of the Dutch bank firmly announced that the bank would continue gold convertibility. With this declaration from the Dutch bank, the demand for cash gradually decreased, and the movement to sell public bonds also stopped. The securities market has a solid trend, and the foreign exchange market also shows greater confidence. The pound has returned to its original price of 8.41 guilders, and the U.S. dollar is now worth 2.11 guilders. According to banking circles, the Dutch currency is not in danger for the time being, and the possibility of abandoning the gold standard can at least be eliminated for the time being.

<p>Regarding the Far Eastern Situation</p>
<p>法國豈能坐視</p>
<p>How Can France Sit idly By?</p>
<p>巴黎報紙之論調</p>
<p>The Arguments of Parisian Newspapers</p>
<p>(Paris) A recent editorial in the French left-wing newspaper L'Ère Nouvelle stated that France would inevitably make a mistake if it remained indifferent to the situation between Japan and Russia, because (1) the flames of war in the Far East will spread to Europe, and (2) the Franco-Russian friendship is currently a serious factor in French policy. France must not stand idly by in the face of conflicts that would disadvantage Russia's position. Therefore, France should make some representations to Japan to reduce the dispute. Also, according to Tokyo news from Le Siècle, the Japanese delegation will mention the issue of recognizing the puppet state at the future Economic Conference. If this is not obtained, Japan will adopt a passive attitude toward most of the issues at the conference. (9th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Asahi Shimbun commented on France's request regarding the China Eastern Railway matter, saying that France should best discuss with Soviet Russia a solution to France's interests on this railway when some progress has been made in the China Eastern Railway sales negotiations. Jiji Shinpo stated that the issue of selling the China Eastern Railway did not arise because Japan or "Manchukuo" wanted to buy it, but because Soviet Russia had a need to sell the railway. It is also not bad for "Manchukuo" to buy this railway to eliminate the cause of future conflicts. (9th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>趙仲仁被殺案</p>
<p>Details Released by the Japanese Side on the Zhao Zhongren Murder Case</p>
<p>(Changchun) At 6 PM on December 7 last year, Zhao Zhongren, a director of the Concord Association, visited Cheng Zhiyuan, a councilor of the "Manchukuo" in Changchun City. Cheng unexpectedly shot him with a pistol. Seeing Zhao flee, he ordered his followers to pursue and kill him with pistols. As a result of the interrogation by the Changchun Military Police, Cheng appeared to be mentally disturbed. After three months of mental assessment, it was confirmed that Cheng Zhiyuan was indeed in a state of mental disturbance at the time of the crime. Therefore, he was not prosecuted and was confined to a mental hospital. Justice Minister Feng Hanqing announced this yesterday. (9th Dentsu Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Changchun) The Cheng Zhiyuan shooting of Zhao Zhongren case was previously prohibited from being published and has only recently been declassified. The content is as follows: At 6 PM on December 7 last year, a shooting suddenly occurred in front of the Sihe Street Building in Changchun City. The assailant was a gentleman who leisurely drove away by car with four followers after committing the crime. The Changchun Military Police learned of the incident and, under the command of Yamamura, the head of the Special Higher Police Section, searched the entire city. It was eventually discovered that the assailant was Cheng Zhiyuan, the former governor of Heilongjiang Province and current councilor of "Manchukuo." Cheng's whereabouts were immediately investigated, and it was learned that Cheng was due to attend a banquet hosted by Staff Officer Itagaki that night and had already gone to "Yachiyo" in Yoshino-cho. Yamamura, the head of the Special Higher Police Section, escorted Cheng to the military police station from the banquet at "Yachiyo" for protection. Since Cheng had injured someone on October 12, this was the second time. Therefore, his actions were subject to considerable discussion, and this act of murder by someone in such a high position was regarded as a serious matter. According to Yamamura, the head of the Special Higher Police Section, the victim was Zhao Zhongren, a director of the Concord Association. On December 7 last year, Cheng invited Zhao to attend Staff Officer Itagaki's banquet with him, asking him to come to his residence. When Zhao arrived on time and had not yet entered the door, Cheng took out a pistol from inside and shot him. Zhao was shocked and fled, but Cheng ordered his follower, Wang Yaowu, to fire three more shots in pursuit, two of which hit. Seeing that he had fallen, Cheng went to the banquet in Zhao's car. Although Zhao was taken to the South Manchuria Railway Hospital, he eventually died of his injuries. According to Cheng's initial statement, he abandoned the pistol at the scene after using it and that Wang was the direct perpetrator. On the 8th, when Wang's whereabouts were investigated, it was revealed that Wang had taken the pistol and fled to a brothel in the city. Wang was captured there, and it was learned that all the actions were directed by Cheng. Zhao was originally a businessman, and Cheng appointed him as a military counselor in Heilongjiang Province, praising his talent. Later, he was transferred to the position of director of the Concord Association. Yamamura, the head of the Special Higher Police Section, considering the seriousness of the case, invited Councilor Komai Tokuzo to the military police station. When Cheng was asked about the cause of the incident, he replied, "You may be surprised by what happened last night, but I believe I did what I should have done and have no regrets. Since Zhao followed me when I was the governor of Heilongjiang Province, his public and private actions have been detrimental to Manchukuo since its establishment. If this person remains, he will be extremely harmful to the future of Manchukuo, and he often led me to do evil. Therefore, I should eliminate him based on my personal feelings. Since I have violated the law, please punish me according to the national law, and I will not seek pardon. I can only express my gratitude for your kindness." He stated his case with dignity and without fear. Councilor Komai, knowing that Cheng had injured someone before and that this would worry Puyi, immediately instructed Cheng to resign from his position as a councilor, and Cheng immediately drafted his resignation.

<p>May 9th National Humiliation Memorial Meeting</p>
<p>葉楚傖報告如何湔雪國恥</p>
<p>Ye Chucang Reports on How to Wipe Out National Humiliation</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The central government held the May 9th National Humiliation Memorial Meeting at 8 AM this morning. Central Committee members Chen Guofu, Ye Chucang, Chen Lifu, Gu Zhenggang, Li Ciwen, Huang Jichen, and others, as well as representatives from various agencies and staff, totaling more than 600 people, attended. Standing Committee member Ye Chucang presided over the meeting and reported, stating that Japan's continental policy has changed from unreasonable aggression after the Sino-Japanese War to diplomatic aggression. After the September 18th Incident, it changed again from diplomatic aggression to unreasonable aggression. We should always follow the teachings of the Premier, engage in passive defense, and fight to the end, and never sign unequal treaties to prevent them from having a legal basis. The establishment of many unequal treaties in the past hundred years or so was due to weak national power, political chaos, and the ignorance of warlords. However, it was also caused by three bad mentalities among the people: (1) not understanding the national situation, being either arrogant or self-deprecating; (2) seeking temporary peace due to fear of trouble; and (3) even taking advantage of opportunities to undermine national policies for personal gain. The current national situation is critical, and the people still have these phenomena, which have not been eliminated. The future is extremely dangerous. Today, as we commemorate the national humiliation, we should turn the tide and completely eliminate the above three bad mentalities. Only then can the national humiliation be wiped out.

<p>A Young Woman's Loss of Virtue</p>
<p>A Page from the History of Urban Crime</p>
<p>After Defiling Her, They Deceived Her of Her Possessions</p>
<p>The Punishment of the Three Young Men Seems Still Insufficient</p>
<p>Kuang Yue'e, a young woman from Changzhou, 26 years old, with a beautiful appearance, had been living in her hometown. Recently, because her husband, Xu Shengfu, had been working as a merchant in Shanghai for a long time without any news, his survival uncertain, out of longing, she prepared her luggage on the 2nd of this month and came to Shanghai alone to inquire about him. She stayed at the home of Ye Shitian at No. 7 Yude Lane, Yunnan Road, who had previously been a neighbor. Ye's profession was singing Suzhou ballads, and he had to go to the Ren Shi Jie amusement park to perform every day. Yue'e had long admired the prosperity of Shanghai. Although she had not yet found her husband, her mood and interest were not diminished. Therefore, she often followed Ye to the amusement park to enjoy the sights. Unexpectedly, she was</p>
<p>Targeted by Those Who Hunt for Beauty</p>
<p>They teased her incessantly. The woman's heart was not made of stone, and her feelings were stirred. One evening, she was lured by Zhu A'san, Liu Zhengyun, and Xiang Baoxian to the Qichang Hotel at the intersection of Hankou Road and Zhejiang Road for a deep conversation. However, it was difficult for three men and one woman to stay together. After Zhu and the others agreed amongst themselves, Zhu alone accompanied the woman to sleep, while Liu and Xiang left. As the beautiful morning dream was still deep, a woman named Shen, claiming to be Zhu's wife, suddenly knocked on the door, scolding Zhu for not cherishing his own wife and tasting wild flavors. They quarreled with each other. Yue'e, witnessing the scene,</p>
<p>Could Not Help But Feel Ashamed</p>
<p>She got up to leave. Zhu, knowing that Liu and Xiang were still hoping to get a share, transferred Yue'e to them. At that time, Liu happened to arrive. Yue'e saw that he was dressed in a Western suit, with a suave manner. The shame in her heart immediately dissipated, and she felt a sense of joy. From then on, she and Liu were together day and night. A few days ago, Liu said that he was going to Hangzhou for a spring outing and asked the woman to go with him. The woman immediately agreed. Liu then retrieved the luggage that she had left at Ye's house and brought it back to the hotel, and also asked Zhu and Shen to help move it. After the luggage was retrieved, Liu said to the woman again, "Your hairstyle is too old-fashioned and lacks elegance. I would like to accompany you to the barber shop</p>
<p>To Redo Your Hair."</p>
<p>At this time, the woman's mind had been completely seduced. She obeyed Liu's every command. They went straight to a barber shop on Wuma Road. As the hairdressing was only half finished, Liu suddenly claimed that the train to Hangzhou was about to depart. "Your hair is not yet completely cut, so I have to go buy the ticket first. I will definitely wait for you at the station." After saying this, he turned and left. Yue'e wanted to chase him but could not. After her hair was finished, she rushed back to the hotel, but all her luggage had disappeared. Because the hotel porter Huang Yuansheng had previously praised Liu for</p>
<p>How Wealthy He Was</p>
<p>She thought that Huang must know the whereabouts of Liu and the others, so she quickly inquired. However, Huang blamed the woman for being careless. Therefore, the woman reported to the Lao Zha police station, and detectives Wang Shusen and Cao Qishan investigated. Suspecting Huang Yuansheng, they arrested him. Based on Huang's confession, they rushed to No. 178 Luxiangyuan Road in the city and apprehended Zhu and Shen. After Shen confessed, they learned where Zhu and the others were hiding. They went to Room 138 of the Tongshang Hotel on Avenue Edward VII and recovered the original stolen suitcase. Then, they went to Room 11 of the Beiyang Hotel on Huaxing Road in Zhabei and arrested Zhu, Liu, and Xiang. The woman's belongings,</p>
<p>Clothing and Land Deeds</p>
<p>Etc., only a gold wristwatch and a diamond ring had been pawned. These have now been retrieved from the pawnshop. The remaining items are generally not missing, but her integrity has been completely destroyed. Yesterday morning, the police escorted Zhu and the others to the First Special District District Court. Judge Feng conducted the trial. The police lawyer Ru Baoyi stated the facts of the case and requested that the defendants be punished according to the crime of theft. Kuang Yue'e recounted the process of being seduced. Judge Feng then questioned each of the defendants one by one. In conclusion, Huang Yuansheng was found not guilty. Zhu, Liu, and Xiang were each sentenced to one year and six months of imprisonment. The stolen goods were returned to the original owner.</p>

<p>Crackdown on Flower Association Betting Dens</p>
<p>Capable of Fraudulently Obtaining Over Two Thousand Yuan Per Month</p>
<p>Principal Culprits Still at Large</p>
<p>Recently, gambling under the guise of "flower associations" has become extremely rampant in the Chinese Concession. Listening posts and gambling boats in the Nanshi city area are densely packed, creating a strange phenomenon that sets a new record for flower association gambling. Therefore, the Municipal Public Security Bureau Chief has strictly ordered his subordinates to pay attention to searching and arresting those involved, and has instructed the police brigade to capture them at any time to prevent any cover-ups. It has now been reported that a large-scale flower association betting den is organized at No. 37 Xiaoqiao Tou in the city, and a silver money exchange agency is set up in Xiaobaizha in Hongqiao South. The extensive range of these rabbit holes is evident. Among those in charge, it is said that they are of a shareholder nature, mostly ruffians and detectives with some potential influence, so they act recklessly. The daily fraudulent gains are over two thousand yuan, and the scale of their expenditures is also shocking to hear. After receiving a secret tip, the police brigade dispatched Deputy Officer Pan along with Patrol Officer Li of the 　 Company to the area the day before yesterday, following the clues to completely smash both of the agencies. Silver dollars, silver coins, and copper coins, etc., were seized, packed into three yellow baggage carts. Thirteen prostitutes from the Yi Hong Yuan brothel were arrested on the spot.</p>
<p>Poisoning from Eating Sea Snails</p>
<p>| Director Wu of the Health Bureau Discusses the Reasons |</p>
<p>A few days ago, the owner of the Yi Hong Yuan brothel on Dongxinqiao Street in the French Concession purchased a large batch of sea snails to distribute to the prostitutes in the brothel to celebrate the summer solstice festival on the lunar calendar. Because the purchased snails were particularly large, the prostitutes competed to eat them. Unexpectedly, thirteen of the prostitutes suddenly fell ill the day after eating them, suffering from headaches, fever, abdominal pain, and loss of appetite, leading to suspicions of poisoning. Fortunately, there were no fatalities. After the reporter went to investigate, they obtained several leftover sea snails.</p>
<p>Director Wu Liguo's Explanation</p>
<p>Yesterday, I visited Wu Liguo, the director of the Second Section of the Municipal Health Bureau, and told him the whole story. According to him, sea snails are a type of hard-shelled food. If people with weak digestive systems eat too much, it is very easy to get sick. Moreover, sea snails may have decayed or grown bacteria inside the shell due to prolonged exposure, making them very dangerous to eat.</p>
<p>What People in the Fishing Industry Said</p>
<p>The reporter also visited people in the fishing industry to investigate the origin of sea snails. According to them, they are produced in the sandy mudflats along the coast. They can be picked up everywhere when the tide recedes. However, it is safe to eat small ones before the summer solstice, but particularly large ones should not be eaten after the summer solstice. There is a type of red dragonfly in summer that cannot be eaten. It is said that this red dragonfly is transformed from this type of particularly large sea snail. However, it is unlikely that a shelled animal can transform into a winged animal.</p>
<p>The Thirteen Are Fortunately Unharmed</p>
<p>Fortunately, all thirteen prostitutes in the brothel were unharmed after eating the snails. According to their careful observation, a suspicious point was discovered: after these large sea snails were soaked and cooked in hot water, tiny green spots appeared in the gaps in their shells, while ordinary small sea snails did not show this change even after being soaked and cooked in hot water. Wei Sheng, 32 years old, from Jiading; Zhang Zhixing, 41 years old, from Shanghai; Qin Axiang, 35 years old, from Wuxi; and Zhu Jinlin, 39 years old, from Shanghai, were arrested. The remaining principals, including Jin Bao and Detective Li from a certain place, escaped and have not yet been apprehended. They were all taken into custody along with the team and presented for investigation. However, it was learned yesterday that the four arrested were not serious offenders and have reportedly been released after paying a fine.</p>
<p>Tu Wenzhao Agrees to Move Contraband Fish</p>
<p>The Every Day News reports that after the Municipal Fisheries Inspection Committee discovered that the Japanese fishing boat Kaiyo Maru No. 9 was importing large quantities of contraband fish, which were being stored in the Hongchang Cold Storage Company's cold storage on Miller Road, in addition to submitting the case to the first meeting of the Municipal Fisheries Association's directors and supervisors for handling, they also submitted a request to the Social Bureau yesterday to prevent the company from registering. After the Fisheries Association issued a warning, the company has moved the contraband fish. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Report to the Social Bureau</p>
<p>Report Regarding Japanese Vessels' Infringement on Fishing Rights and the Hongchang Cold Storage Company's Collusion by Storing Contraband Fish; Requesting that Registration be Denied. It has come to our Association's attention on the 3rd of this month that the Japanese fishing boat Kaiyo Maru has caught over 3,000 boxes of yellow croaker and other fish in our Zhejiang waters, and is freezing them in the Hongchang Cold Storage Company on Miller Road in the Public Concession, falsely claiming that they were caught by Chinese fishermen, which is a severe infringement on our national rights. The Hongchang Cold Storage Company has not been open for long and specializes in cold-storing fresh and salted fish and other goods for the Japanese, hoping to profit from this. It is now learned that the company is planning to register with your Bureau to facilitate its business. Therefore, our Association has exposed this scheme and submitted it to the second joint meeting of directors and supervisors for deliberation, requesting that your Bureau deny the company's registration (remainder omitted).</p>
<p>Fisheries Association Warning</p>
<p>According to the decision made at the first meeting of directors and supervisors on the 7th, the Municipal Fisheries Association dispatched representatives Huang Zhenshi and Wang Yunpu to the company yesterday morning at 11:00 AM, along with personnel from the Fisheries Guidance Office. They met with Manager Tu Wenzhao and explained the greater picture to him, urging him to quickly move the stored contraband fish. Manager Tu Wenzhao replied that he had already negotiated with Jiang Azhen, the original handler, and that the stored contraband fish would be completely moved out within the next two days. He also stated that he would no longer trade with the Japanese in the future and was willing to publish a public announcement in the newspaper to clarify his intentions.</p>
<p>Be Careful of Dogs Poisoned with Spurge Laurel</p>
<p>Recently, there have been reports of people in Shanghai poisoning dogs. Twelve dogs have died so far. It is now learned that these individuals are active again. They use spurge laurel wrapped in meat, throwing it into fences or next to houses, paying particular attention to Danish Great Danes. Dog owners must take strong precautions. When dogs are idle, they should wear muzzles. If suspicious individuals are seen loitering near the house, they should be questioned. If pieces of meat are found in the yard, they should be reported to the police station immediately. If a dog swallows poison, it should be given a weight-based emetic immediately. For Danish dogs, use one tablespoon of table salt dissolved in warm water and drench the dog with it. If the dog is smaller, reduce the amount of salt accordingly. Drench the dog as much as possible to ensure that the meat is vomited out and the poison is not absorbed into the body. After the dog vomits, drench it with a mixture of one part brandy and three parts water. Place the dog in a dark, quiet place and wait for the veterinarian to arrive.</p>

This is because the Chinese government has contracted with the company to build breakwaters, docks, and wharves in that area. The round trip is expected to take about a month.</p>

<p>The Melon Seed King Involved in a Lawsuit</p>
<p>"Delicious" Sues "Fortune, Prosperity, and Longevity" for Counterfeiting</p>
<p>Sold in Various Tea and Snack Shops</p>
<p>Rong Songnian, a native of Ningbo, runs a certain Japanese shop in Rongji Lane, Wuma Road, and has been making huge profits over the years. Two years ago, he invested 5,000 yuan to establish the "Delicious" company, imitating Ningbo's Dayou soy sauce melon seeds. In less than half a year, he made a profit of 50,000 to 60,000 yuan. Because he did not distribute bonuses to his colleagues according to the regulations, the capable staff resigned one after another and formed the "Fortune, Prosperity, and Longevity" company, whose business is booming and sales are very wide. Rong was jealous and filed a criminal lawsuit against Du Chuqing, an employee of the "Fortune, Prosperity, and Longevity" company, for the crime of counterfeiting trademarks. The case was heard yesterday in the Fifth Criminal Division of the First District Court. Rong appeared in court and claimed that the defendant had counterfeited his "King" trademark. Du also appeared in court with his lawyer, and each presented their trademarks for inspection. The plaintiff's trademark was a "lonely crane," while the defendant's trademark was a "three stars," with no similarity at all. The plaintiff then stated that the words "King" in the phrase "Melon Seed King" had been registered for patent. The defendant argued that the plaintiff had not used the words "King" as a trademark. He then presented the plaintiff's melon seed bag as evidence, stating that "Melon Seed King" is a common and ordinary food name, sold in various tea and snack shops (and presented melon seed bags from various shops for verification), and there is no possibility of patent. There is a clear distinction between the trademark "King" and the name "Melon Seed King." Furthermore, the "Fortune, Prosperity, and Longevity" company has a manager responsible, and he is not responsible for anything. Now the plaintiff must know that the manager of the "Fortune, Prosperity, and Longevity" company is his uncle but does not sue him, deliberately slandering him. He immediately filed a counterclaim for the crime of malicious prosecution. After the lawyers on both sides debated the matter, because it was late, it was announced that the trial would be continued on the 15th.</p>

<p>Ji Shan Xuan About to Relocate</p>
<p>Ji Shan Xuan was founded by people from Haining and is organized by philanthropic gentlemen from Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. It specializes in distributing prescriptions, summer medicine, and other pills and powders needed for various ailments at Gujia Lane, Ningbo Road, Shanghai. It has been operating this charitable cause for fifteen years. Countless poor people have benefited from the Xuan. The expenses required are all donated by members according to their ability. Since the impact of the January 28th Incident, members have been scattered. In order to save expenses, the Haining natives moved the Xuan to the fourth floor of a certain building in Wu Shao Lane. Recently, due to the inconvenience of going in and out, in response to the request of the majority of members, they have leased No. 17 Xiangfen Lane as an office. It is currently being renovated. It is said that the renovation will be completed soon, and they plan to move in and continue to carry out various charitable activities as usual.</p>
<p>Pan Zhongce</p>
<p>Commits Suicide by Poison Due to Economic Hardship</p>
<p>Rescued by Doctors and Granted a New Life</p>
<p>Relapses with a Severe Illness and Finally Passes Away</p>
<p>Pan Zhongce, a native of Jiaxing, Zhejiang, was 23 years old this year and not yet married. He had parents and a six-year-old younger brother at home. Pan used to work in the rice business in Shanghai, but recently he became unemployed, resulting in economic hardship. He suddenly had suicidal thoughts. At 3:00 PM on the 5th of this month, he went alone to the Anle Second Hotel at No. 4 Aide Lane, Zhengjia Muqiao Street, in the French Concession and rented Room 33. After entering the room, he closed the door tightly and wrote two suicide notes. He took poison that night and the poison took effect in the middle of the night. The room attendant discovered him and reported it to the front desk. The police were notified and sent Pan to Renji Hospital for treatment. The suicide notes were taken back to the police station and filed. Pan entered the hospital and was rescued by doctors, who removed the poison, and he was granted a new life. However, because his body had undergone a major blow, he was mentally exhausted and remained in the hospital for treatment. Unexpectedly, his condition worsened. The treatment was ineffective, and he died at 2:00 PM the day before yesterday. The hospital notified the police, who sent a detective to the Tongren Fuyuan Funeral Home to examine the body. No family members were found, and a report was filed with the Second Special District Court yesterday. Prosecutor Deng Baosun was commissioned to go to the funeral home and verified that the deceased had died of illness. The case was officially closed. Room attendant Lu Chunkun was questioned about the circumstances of the discovery, and the detectives presented the suicide notes. The official then ordered the body to be photographed and buried by the Tongren Fuyuan Funeral Home, awaiting identification by relatives.</p>
<p>Young Woman Cries Uncontrollably After Taking Poison</p>
<p>Dies After Being Sent to Bao Long Hospital</p>
<p>Commits Suicide After Failing to Stop Husband from Gambling</p>
<p>The woman Wu Song, from Ningbo, was 19 years old and of good appearance. Her husband, Wu Qingrong, worked at the Jinye Exchange. Usually, the couple were very harmonious and lived in a certain place on Laoshenjiao Road in the French Concession. Recently, she had given birth to a child, so she was in poor health. A few days ago, she returned to her mother's house at No. 232 Bao'an Lane, Tianjin Road, to recuperate. Her husband also temporarily resided there. The day before yesterday, when Wu Gongbi returned, he told his wife that friends had invited him to gamble. The woman believed that gambling was a way to waste money and energy, so she advised him not to go. Unexpectedly, her husband refused to listen, which led to an argument. After Wu left, the woman was very upset and suddenly had the idea of ending her life. She swallowed opium and tried to kill herself. When her husband returned home, it was already late at 11:00 PM. He saw his wife lying on the bed, her face pale, crying uncontrollably. After questioning her repeatedly, he learned that she had taken poison. He immediately sent her to Bao Long Hospital for treatment, but it was ineffective, and she soon died. The hospital reported to the Lao Zha police station, and Detective Qiu Sijiu was ordered to investigate. He carried the body to the Verifying Body Office on Ferry Road. Yesterday morning, the First Special District District Court commissioned Prosecutor Guo Wei to go to the office and verify the body. The case was officially closed. According to the statement of the deceased's husband, Wu Qingrong, the deceased was his wife. She was usually quiet and reserved. The day before yesterday, because he could not refuse the invitation of friends, he went out to play mahjong. She wanted to stop him from going, which led to a slight argument. Unexpectedly, she committed suicide by taking poison because of this trivial matter. Guo heard the statement and ruled that the deceased, Wu Song, had died from opium poisoning. The body was handed over to her husband, Wu Qingrong, who made a guarantee to take it back for burial. The Perpetrators in the Xiaoshan Kidnapping Case Sentenced</p>
<p>Shen Yun, a Shaoxing native who committed kidnapping, in February of this year, under the order of the fugitive bandit leader Shen Chuan Dog, gathered more than ten fellow villagers, including Zhang Baichuan, Wang A'chang, Lu Shangao, Zhou Chuanfu, and Liu Xichen, and went to the Tongshanwan village in Xiaoshan County, Shaoxing, and kidnapped Chen Zurong, the fourteen-year-old only son of Chen Tianyou's family, and brought him to Shanghai. They hid him in the home of fellow villager Chen Shiying at No. 3 Ping'an Lane, Xuehuali Road, in the French Concession. They demanded a large ransom from the victim. On the afternoon of March 10th, they arranged for the victim to meet at the Yuli entrance on Caishi Street to discuss the ransom. The French Concession Police Special Agent Jin Jiulin learned of this and led the detectives Zhang Ziquan, Zhou Bingcheng, and Zhou Yaoting, along with patrol officers, to rush to the scene. They arrested Shen and the others, along with suspects Gao Bin, Chen Sheng, Wu Wang, Wang Chen, and Chuan Lanying, a total of twelve men and women. The victim was rescued, and they were sent to the Second Special District Court. The police lawyer filed a public prosecution in accordance with Article 1, Section 1, of the Law on the Punishment of Bandits. The interrogation details have been reported previously. The case has now been concluded. Yesterday, Judge Li Changnian presided over the criminal court and ordered the defendants to be brought to court. Shen Yun was sentenced to 18 years in prison for kidnapping and extortion, and deprived of his civil rights for 18 years. Zhang Baichuan, Wang A'chang, Lu Shangao, Zhou Chuanfu, and Liu Xichen were each sentenced to 15 years in prison for kidnapping and extortion, and deprived of their civil rights for 15 years. Chen Shiying was sentenced to 12 years in prison for assisting in kidnapping and extortion, and deprived of his civil rights for 12 years. The number of days of detention before the judgment was confirmed was calculated at two days to one day of imprisonment. Gao Bin, Chen Sheng, Wang Chen, Wu Wang, and Chuan Lanying were all found not guilty. During the appeal period, Shen and the other seven were detained in the detention center. Gao and the other five were released on bail. Those without bail were detained.</p>
<p>Englishman's Car Runs Over a Boy</p>
<p>Yang Yongliang, the six-year-old son of Yang Xiaoxun, a native of Dabu, Guangdong, who lived at No. 751 Minquan Road in the French Concession, was led by his grandmother past No. 301 Avenue Edward VII at 1:00 PM on the 6th of this month. While crossing the road from south to north, a private car No. 11658 driven by a driver hired by a British man named Pete was coming from the east heading west. They were unable to avoid each other, and the child was knocked down by the fender and injured his head. The police arrived and sent the injured child to Renji Hospital for treatment. The driver was taken to the police station to await instructions. The child died of his injuries on the evening of the 8th. The police sent the body to the Tongren Fuyuan Funeral Home. Yesterday, the Traffic Department reported to the Second Special District Court, and Prosecutor Deng was commissioned to go to the funeral home, verified the body, and officially opened the case. The defendant, the driver, was questioned about the circumstances of the accident. The official ruled that Yang Yongliang had died of injuries caused by a car accident. The body was taken by the family for burial. The defendant was returned to the Traffic Department for questioning.</p>

<p>National Humiliation Week Speech</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang Yousan's View on Sino-Japanese Relations</p>
<p>May 7th at the Shanghai YMCA</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, today is the first day of National Humiliation Commemoration Week. May has always been a month of many disasters, and many National Humiliation Days, such as May 3rd, May 7th, and May 9th, are especially related to Japan. During this time of national crisis, commemorating national humiliation is naturally very sad and indignant; but in the midst of grief, we should think about how to cope with this national crisis. Now that time is short, I will briefly say a few words.</p>
<p>The current proposals for coping with the national crisis can be roughly divided into five points: first, war, that is, declaring war on Japan; second, peace, that is, negotiating peace with Japan; third, struggle, that is, long-term resistance; fourth, reliance, that is, relying on international forces to sanction Japan; and fifth, delay, that is, not adopting any measures, but simply delaying the time. Now I will briefly analyze these five proposals.</p>
<p>(1) Pro-War. Now Japan is carrying out various forms of violent aggression. The atrocities of September 18th and January 28th, as well as the loss of Jehol, have only increased. This has aroused the emotions of the Chinese people to the extreme. Of course, no one wants to be subjected to humiliation, and everyone wants to use force to deal with it. Anyone with blood in their veins has this idea. Therefore, we often hear calls for declarations of war and severance of relations. From the perspective of emotions and blood alone, absolutely no one opposes this pro-war approach, but we must analyze its advantages and disadvantages. The first advantage of the pro-war approach is that once a formal war begins, it can allow the general public's indignant emotions to be vented. Although the sacrifices of war are great, we are willing to sacrifice, because enduring the current suffocating suffering is really more unbearable than a quick and painful sacrifice. Second, it can maintain the nation's dignity. Given China's current situation, enduring all kinds of oppression while still swallowing insults makes it really difficult to gain a foothold in the world. If we declare war on Japan, regardless of victory or defeat, at least we can win back some dignity for the country. Third, external resistance may promote internal unity in China. The country is still divided. If we declare war on the outside, even if we cannot unite wholeheartedly, at least all parties will not dare to openly squabble. Fourth, declaring war can change the international atmosphere. The diplomatic policies of various countries can shift depending on the strength of our country's resistance. China is currently a great sales market for the world's advanced industrial countries. If China and Japan declare war, it will inevitably jeopardize their commercial relations, and they will have to come forward to intervene. Especially Britain and the United States have the deepest relationship with the Far East. The Yangtze River basin is entirely within the British sphere of influence. Once it is affected, the British will inevitably step in. All these can be caused by war to motivate the world to jointly sanction Japan. These five reasons for pro-war are of course theoretical. In reality, is it difficult to declare war? Those who advocate not going to war believe that declaring war on Japan is impossible. There are five reasons. (A) No Weapons of War. Although China's army has about three million soldiers, the number is not small, but there is a great lack of modern weapons of war. We know that modern warfare cannot be done without relying on modern weapons. The navy is especially pathetic. The total tonnage of all the warships in the country is only 30,000 tons. In terms of air force, although all walks of life are now promoting aviation to save the country, it is impossible to say whether it will be effective. We often see in the newspapers that there are broadsword teams in the north, repeatedly defeating powerful enemies in the northeast. Their brave spirit is naturally worthy of our twelve points of admiration, but to say that a body of flesh and blood, relying on a knife, can compete with airplanes, bombs, and tanks is something that anyone with a little common sense will know is difficult to do in reality. (B) No Military Discipline. To fight a foreign war, command must be unified and orders must be obeyed. Now the northern armies fighting are not closely linked, and they are fighting on their own. One side is experiencing very tense battles, while the other side stands by and watches, as if it has nothing to do with them. For example, when the battle of Jehol was recently tense, only Sun Dianying, Song Zheyuan, etc. were fighting hard along the Great Wall, while most of the others were standing still. With such a battle, how much chance of victory is there? (C) No Diplomacy. Modern international warfare cannot be fought in isolation with one country against others. Which country in the world can stand on the same side as us now? Without diplomatic coordination, there is absolutely no hope of victory. (D) No Relief. Military supplies and transportation are very important in the military. China's industry and transportation have no foundation. Even petroleum, an indispensable item in wartime, would cause panic if the source of petroleum were cut off once the sea lanes were blockaded, even if there were airplanes and tanks, they would have to be parked and unable to move. Also, copper, iron, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, hydrochloric acid, and all kinds of machinery are all dependent on foreign countries, and transportation stoppages will cause panic. The lack of food is also a problem. (E) The People Are Not Organized. Now, if we want to fight Japan, we must mobilize the whole country. If the people lack organizational ability, the outcome of the front is not yet determined, and the rear is already in turmoil. This is also an obstacle to warfare. In summary, the general public believes that the outcome of going to war with Japan is not certain. (2) Pro-Peace. Since September 18th, no one wanted peace, and no one dared to talk about peace, but now, because the Japanese are pressing into Shanhaiguan and some people in the north have begun to openly discuss peace. Their proposal is to abandon the regions outside Shanhaiguan in order to preserve Tianjin and Beiping. However, peace must have conditions. The conditions for peace: (1) If the two countries are evenly matched, and once a dispute arises, the outcome of victory or defeat is not yet determined, in order to avoid both sides suffering, it is best to make peace. In this case, peace is possible; (2) If one of the two countries is first defeated and then turns into a small victory, and the situation has turned, it is better to make peace at this time than to surrender under duress. In this case, peace is also possible; (3) If the two countries are in a stalemate and a third strong country comes out to intervene, then peace can also be made, because both sides are under pressure, and one side will not suffer excessive losses; (4) If one of the two countries, the victor, is already exhausted and willing to end the war, and the defeated side makes peace at this time, it will not suffer great losses. In this case, peace is also possible. These are the four conditions under which peace is possible. Now that we want to make peace, do we have these four conditions? Of course, we don't have any of them. So how can we make peace? Even if we take a step back, peace should have been discussed at the very beginning of the September 18th Incident. At that time, there was still the possibility of opening negotiations. Now that the four provinces have already been occupied and are about to encroach on Tianjin and Beiping, if we go to make peace with Japan at this time, that is simply surrendering under duress. And even if we abandon the Northeast and use the Great Wall as the boundary to seek temporary peace, can we satisfy the Japanese desire? This is probably impossible! The Japanese ambition for the mainland is extremely great. They will not be satisfied unless they completely annex our country. They not only have this ambition for our country, but also want to sweep up the territories of Britain and the United States in East Asia. Speaking like this, the road to peace is absolutely impossible. And at this time, absolutely no one dares to openly bear the responsibility of making peace, so peace cannot be achieved. (3) Pro-Struggle. Struggle means long-term resistance. If there is no power to declare war, change the strategy to exhaust the enemy and cause internal collapse. Although this method is not as extensive as a formal declaration of war, equipment command relief, etc. should also be well prepared, which refers to our resistance. As for the Japanese invasion, the new budget of the Japanese government, the income for this year is 1.28 billion yuan, and the expenditure is 2.23 billion yuan, which is tens of millions of yuan in arrears, of which the navy and army expenses account for 800 million yuan. This is Japan's expense. The total Japanese national debt is 6.3 billion yuan, and each citizen must bear an average of 100 yuan. From this point of view, Japan's internal collapse is not impossible. In short, Japan's domestic economy is tight, which is undeniable. But for this reason, they are eagerly seizing the Northeast in order to solve the economic difficulties, so they regard the Northeast as a lifeline. The three northeastern provinces are rich in products, such as timber, soybeans, steel, coal, placer gold, livestock, grains, etc. The income is not low. Once developed by the Japanese, it will be an unlimited source of wealth. The customs tax revenue in the 20th year of the Republic was 26 million taels, and the salt tax was 19 million taels. Since the Japanese have obtained the above, they can slightly relieve the economic panic and implement mass immigration. Japan is now experiencing rural bankruptcy and worker unemployment. There is unrest everywhere. The original situation was precarious, but since winning the war, they have made every effort to publicize and anesthetize the people, which is quite enough to increase the people's belief in the government. The Japanese army sent to the Northeast is only about 50,000 people, about 3 or more divisions, which is enough to run amok, while the people of our country are suffering endless torture. So to say that struggle is not effective in the near future. (4) Pro-Reliance, that is, relying on other countries to come out and help us, and using force to stop the violent Japanese. This is the worst policy, and the relationship between international relations is complicated and confusing. It is a pipe dream to want them to speak with force now. There are several points in the current international situation that are beneficial to Japan: (A) Capitalist countries want the Japanese to be the vanguard of the anti-Russian front, and they are not willing to offend Japan. (B) Western European countries are competing for dominance, and some countries, such as France, want to obtain assistance in the international arena and are trying to win over Japan. (C) The economies of various countries are declining and they are unable to take care of international sanctions. (D) The interests of major countries such as Britain and the United States still have some conflicts, and their steps cannot be coordinated. Recently, there is a possibility of rapprochement between Britain, the United States, and France at the Washington Conference, but it is still feared that Japan will feign pro-Russian relations to make threats. In this situation, it is difficult for Europe and the United States to use force to sanction Japan. Even if any country comes out, it will be of no benefit to our country. It is nothing more than a competition for markets. (5) Pro-Delay. That is to delay time. This is the method that is currently being implemented. We are just passing the days casually. Of course, this is the worst method, and it cannot be considered a method. But now that war is impossible, peace is unacceptable, struggle is unfeasible, and reliance is unreliable, some people can only use delay as the only solution in a situation where nothing is possible. In this impossible situation, what should we do? We need to look further. We should regard the trauma we have suffered as a lesson. If we can learn from this lesson and make efforts to revive ourselves, there is still a glimmer of hope for the future. Otherwise, our country will truly be doomed forever. Since the Sino-Japanese War, how many times has Japan invaded our country? We should have realized all these stimuli long ago. But the Chinese people are too unwilling to be competitive. The stimuli are repeated over and over again, but we just let them pass, so the invasion is getting worse every time. If we can carefully examine the reasons for being invaded, which stem from our own corruption, then to fundamentally save ourselves, we still need to revitalize the spirit of our nation. Currently, there are only two ways to cope with the national crisis: one is to treat the symptoms, and the other is to treat the root cause. The way to treat the symptoms is to continue to make every effort to resist, and there must be more powerful resistance. The increase in military equipment, the unity of command, the relief of material, and the diplomatic efforts are all necessary conditions for resistance. In terms of treating the root cause, we hope that the government will be responsible for handling four items: (1) The livelihood of the people. Now the people are living in poverty, which must be resolved urgently. (2) Safeguarding civil rights. The basic rights of the people, such as personal, speech, and freedom of association, must be guaranteed. (3) Purify officialdom and severely punish corruption. (4) Prepare national defense. What is hoped for from the people is the revitalization of their own personality, intensifying the work within each person's responsibility, eliminating all the weaknesses such as greed, laziness, and timidity, and developing the advantages of the nation as much as possible. This is the fundamental principle for us to stand in the world. If we can do this, then there will always be a day to settle the accounts for the national crisis and national humiliation.

<p>Ministry of Education's Financial Difficulties</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance Actually Pays 21,000 Yuan Per Month</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education's funding, according to the original budget of income and expenditure, was 42,000 yuan. Since the national crisis, the Ministry of Finance has reduced it, and the actual monthly payment to the Ministry of Education is 21,000 yuan. Out of this, the Ministry of Education allocates 2,500 yuan per month to the National Institute for Compilation and Translation. In reality, there is a shortfall of only 18,500 yuan, which relies on 25,000 yuan from Zhejiang Province's poppy tax to supplement it. Since the national crisis, only one or two months of poppy tax have been handed over, with significant arrears. It is said that the Ministry of Education is therefore unable to make ends meet and is experiencing extreme financial difficulties.</p>

<p>Since Shanghai University reorganized in the spring of 1928, five years have passed. Thanks to the efforts of the president, faculty, and students, as well as the material and spiritual support from all sectors of society, the atmosphere is vigorous. The five-year plan, such as adding school buildings, expanding library facilities, increasing equipment and specimens, and improving teaching, has been gradually realized and has achieved considerable success. Yesterday, the school held its annual board of directors meeting, attended by board members Li Yaobang, Yu Bingcha, Yu Shouchun, Hu Yongqi, Chen Chunbao, Xu Zhendong, Lin Yuchu, Herbert, and Weiles, and more than ten other people. Important motions, in addition to approving the budget for the next academic year, also stipulated the new five-year plan after this, with a rough outline as follows: (1) Implementing the vocationalization of courses and striving to develop the existing colleges of Arts, Sciences, and Commerce; (2) Limiting enrollment in order to improve teaching effectiveness and pay attention to character training. The university department will have a maximum of 600 students (400 men and 200 women), the business school in the city center will have 600 students, the affiliated middle school will have 400 students, and the Hudong Commune 　night school will have 1,000 students; (3) Improving teaching experiments, the general examination honor program tutorial system, etc.; (4) Improving faculty welfare, savings, pension, etc.; (5) Adding school buildings, auditoriums, classrooms, faculty residences, etc.; (6) Raising more funds and seeking more donations to help out-of-school youth.</p>

<p>Peida Books and Instruments Transported to Zhengzhou</p>
<p>丨A Total of One Hundred and Sixty-Eight Boxes丨Acting President Xu Songming Went to the Station to Take Care of Them丨</p>
<p>(Special Dispatch from Peiping) The first batch of 168 boxes of books and instruments from Peiping University were transported to Zhengzhou by the Pinghan Railway at 3:00 PM today (the 7th), to be stored in the Jincheng Bank. Before the train departed, Lv Jiemin, the director of the general affairs department of the university office, and the heads of the general affairs departments of the seven colleges were all at the station to take care of everything. Acting President Xu Songming made a special inspection. The China Express Transportation Company checked all the wooden boxes one by one, and the train departed on time. The situation of all parties is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Loading and unloading expenses After the valuable instruments and books of each college were packed, they were originally scheduled to be transported south on the 5th of this month. On the afternoon of the 3rd, the office telephoned each college to inquire about it, and each college requested a postponement. Also, because the iron-clad car had not been allocated, it was decided to transport it to Zhengzhou on the afternoon of the 8th and store it in the Jincheng Bank. The storage fee for each box is 30 cents per month, and the China Express Transportation Company is responsible for the transportation. The loading and unloading fee from Ping to Zheng is six yuan per box. Yesterday, news was received from the transportation sector that a 40-ton iron-clad car had been allocated and started on the 6th to load the car at the West Station, and it would go south on the 7th and arrive in Zhengzhou on the 10th. Because of the nature of the package transportation, there is no need to send an escort.</p>
<p>Number of boxes in each college (1) The Medical College has loaded 44 boxes of instruments from each department, 15 boxes of specimens, and 28 boxes of books, for a total of 87 boxes. (2) The College of Arts has one box of files, one box of registration, one box of books, and one box of instruments, for a total of 5 boxes. (3) The College of Agriculture has 20 boxes of microscopes and specimens from the Department of Biology, 10 boxes of surveying instruments and tree measuring instruments from the Department of Forestry (including one box of wood specimens), 3 boxes of agriculture, 4 boxes of the Department of Economics, and 50 boxes of the library, for a total of 50 boxes. (4) Pingda High School has one box of files. (5) The School of Commerce has one box of documents and one box of books, for a total of 2 boxes. (6) The Pingda Office has two boxes of documents. (7) The School of Law has one box of documents and two boxes of books. (8) The School of Engineering has six boxes of books and twelve boxes of instruments, for a total of 18 boxes. (9) The Women's College of Arts and Sciences may be difficult to transport together because the wooden boxes have not been purchased. The total number of boxes above is 168.</p>
<p>Ministry of Railways Allocates Cars The part of Peiping University's important books and instruments transported to Shanghai has been changed to be stored in Zhengzhou in order to facilitate transportation and save transportation costs. The Ministry of Railways has also approved half-price billing and transportation.</p>
<p>Registration has already closed. Currently, Yong Sheng Heng Sen 　Radio Station is preparing for the order of broadcasting, and it is extremely welcomed by all walks of life. Prizes are also coming in continuously. Recently, it has been received a iron cup from Director Xu of the Public Works Bureau, a silver cup from Director Wen of the Public Security Bureau, a silver shield from Zhang Xiaolin, one hundred cans of Golden Bell brand milk from Wuzhou Pharmacy, and various children's products worth one hundred yuan from the Children's Goods Company. The Children's Morning News also plans to give the winners a half-year subscription or several first collection bound volumes. Also, there are gifts for those who criticize the audience, including one hundred cans of incense from Huacheng Tobacco Company, and several pairs of Chrysanthemum brand socks from China First Knitting Factory per person. The greatness of this children's music competition can also be imagined.</p>

Chairman He Siyuan and his wife visited the 　场 very early and left at noon. The track and field competition has been completed, and the athletes who passed the standard number to participate in North China have been selected. Tomorrow will be the all-around sports. Except for one men's high tennis match in the ball games, the rest will also end tomorrow.

<p>China Swimming Association Builds Pool</p>
<p>The members of the China Swimming Research Association are all responsible for carrying out the problem of building a swimming pool. However, it is really rare to find a location that is centrally located, convenient for transportation, and has low rental fees. Recently, a piece of land has been found near the public sports field in the South City. Architects Lu Lian Shou and Wu Jingqi of the Bank of China have been voluntarily planning and designing the prototype, and it will be completed soon. Construction will begin immediately to build an open-air pool first, so that members can have a place to swim as soon as possible. When the weather gets cooler, houses will be added.</p>
<p>My Hopes for Our Country's Sports</p>
<p>Liu Xuesong</p>
<p>During my return to China from the United States this time, I witnessed the state of sports in the country and had many feelings. Compared with the advanced European and American countries in sports, we are naturally far behind. However, if we can train seriously and strive to encourage ourselves from now on, we will definitely not fall behind for long. Even in terms of the results of this Shanghai Secondary School Joint Sports Meet, although it is not very outstanding, it has improved slightly compared to before. Yesterday, Dr. Wang Zhengting came to Hangzhou and talked about this matter. He said that in order to improve the overall level of sports and improve results, we should first train talents in middle schools, so that the future can be hopeful. This is a fundamental plan. However, in addition to this, I have to say a word to our sports community, that is, our country's sports have always been only the individual efforts of schools in various places, and it is not very common among the people. Moreover, many students have very good results in school and practice very diligently, but once they graduate, they completely abandon their sports life. How can we seek further progress in this way? Compared with Europe and the United States, these untrained people are naturally far behind. Our country participated in the American Los Angeles World Games for the first time this year. I personally participated in the grand event and witnessed everything. I deeply felt the importance of this move. Although Liu Changchun did not win any points this time, he has made a deep impression on various countries. The American sports community especially has great sympathy for us. People of the country, why not strive to improve ourselves quickly, what will happen later? The 11th Olympic Games in 1936 will be held in Berlin, Germany. I once told representatives from various countries in the United States that China will definitely have excellent performance results next time. If we can train more, select talents, and then we can occupy a place in the world arena. The first thing to work hard now is the National Games on October 10 this year. I sincerely hope that all parts of the country can take this matter seriously, select good talents, and create excellent records. On the one hand, the Far Eastern Games to be held in 匪 in May next year has also sent a letter of invitation. If these selected people are given considerable training, then the shame of the complete defeat in previous years can be slightly avenged. This is my personal hope for our country's sports. However, it is not difficult to say it, but it is difficult to do it. I sincerely hope that the government authorities can promote it and provide strong assistance, so that sports can gradually become widespread. On the one hand, athletes should also be careful to avoid bad habits and cultivate sportsmanship and the spirit of sports. It must be known that an army with discipline is a powerful army, and an athlete who can abide by the rules is able to strive for progress in results. This is really a fundamental principle, so don't ignore it. Last year, the athletes' dormitory at the World Games had a piece of paper hanging on it with three words to encourage them: (1) SPORTSMANSHIP (2) FELLOWSHIP (3) LEADERSHIP. The Zhejiang Provincial Games will be held soon, which can be used to select candidates to participate in the national selection. I also have high hopes for the trip.</p>
<p>Datong Tennis Wins 4-1 Against Fudan</p>
<p>The Fudan University Tennis Team played a friendly match with Datong University at the Datong stadium yesterday by invitation. The strikes were wonderful, especially the singles match between Liang Deguang and Mai Fengtang was the most outstanding. As a result, Datong won 4-1.</p>
<p>Ping Pong War, Municipal Team A Wins Joint Team</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Kai County Elder</h3>
<p>— Zhan Lu</p>
<p>In the past, there was an old man from Jiang County who, during the Spring and Autumn period, merely said a few humorous words, expressing his age as a mixed-number of Jiazi (sexagenary cycle). The Jin officials' mathematical knowledge was too rudimentary at the time, and they did not dare use such things as division to solve the problem. As a result, they were startled and made a fuss for a while, and that seventy-three-year-old man from Jiang County has been passed down from two thousand several hundred years ago to this day. No wonder Bernard Shaw loved to tell jokes; it turns out that telling jokes has such a great effect.</p>
<p>The death of Li Qingyun, an old man from Kai County, has been reported in the Chongqing dispatch in the newspapers, stating that he was two hundred and fifty-six years old when he finally left the mortal world. The "Qing" character in Qingyun's name is probably a misspelling of the "Qing" character (庆). I remember that in the 17th year of the Republic of China, newspapers in Shanghai widely published a photograph of an elderly man from Sichuan named Li Qingyun, stating that he was two hundred and fifty years old and was from Shanchuan Village in Kai County. Although his age was high, his spirit in the photograph was very clear and vigorous. Unexpectedly, in just five or six years, he still could not escape this gate of life and death; he succumbed to the god of death after all.</p>
<p>The old man from Kai County has passed away. His age exceeded the old man from Jiang County by three times plus thirty-seven seventy-thirds. If the higher the age, the further the transmission, then the old man from Jiang County has been transmitted for two thousand several hundred years, and the old man from Kai County should be famous for seven or eight thousand years. However, I don't think so! The wheel of time keeps turning. The four characters "Old Man from Jiang County" will never fade away, but I am afraid that the name of the old man from Kai County will not be deeply imprinted in people's minds.</p>
<p>Being able to say a few humorous words, being able to express one's age as a mixed-number of Jiazi, being able to make the Jin officials startled and amazed, this is the old man from Jiang County's ability to be passed down. I wonder if the old man from Kai County had such an ability? If not, then after many years, everyone will only know the old man from Jiang County, and no one will know the old man from Kai County.</p>
<p>For a person to strive for immortality, age is not the most important thing; just look at Yan Hui of Confucius' school and Zhou Yu of the Three Kingdoms period.</p>
<h3>Selling Children</h3>
<p>— Xiao Xianxian</p>
<p>"Selling children," is one of the emerging slogans that shroud Shanghai in economic recession, and it has the same effect as "clearance sales regardless of cost, buy one get one free" in attracting customers. If you don't believe me, look, on the streets and in the alleys, in front of stores equipped with a wireless telephone or employing a band of foreign musicians, there are always many distinguished guests who stand around with their hands behind their backs, "looking" but not "patronizing." On the streets and in the alleys, there is a carrying pole for "selling children" parked, and likewise, there are always many distinguished guests who stand around with their hands behind their backs, "looking" but not "patronizing."</p>
<p>Indeed, recently, more and more people have been coming to Shanghai from Henan and Shaanxi to "sell children," so that Shanghai's "children" have become in a surplus situation, "stomach sluggish." But to solve this problem, which is neither too big nor too small, in this early twenty-first century when all countries feel overpopulation, I am afraid it cannot be as "stable, fast, and convenient" as when the Imperial Army occupied the Shenyang Arsenal.</p>
<p>Whether "selling children" is a tragic scene is a matter of opinion. In this "iron-blood save the country" era, I believe that the internal organs in the human body should all be steel-ified and transformed into "hard intestines." When people's snot and tears are stuck together as they sell children, I only think of it as a big sale due to the recession, because occasionally there is a "reactionary philanthropist" who separates people's flesh and blood and buys a child with silver dollars. In this civilized world where no one cares about "human meat buns," they are unlikely to make meat filling out of the children. At most, they will just make the children slaves for a lifetime. In this era when anyone can hope to be a slave, what is so pitiful about being a slave?</p>
<p>"It is a small matter to starve to death, but a great matter to lose one's chastity." No one pities prostitutes who sell their chastity or traitors who sell their conscience, but everyone is alarmed when refugees sell their children to avoid starvation. This is indeed a mystery that can be understood but cannot be understood.</p>
<h3>Man or Woman?</h3>
<p>— Ren Ying</p>
<p>This kind of trick has happened to me for the second time.</p>
<p>The first time, I took a bus on Mystery Street before it was destroyed. I was heading towards Hongkou Park, thinking of breathing in some fresh air to relieve the suffocation accumulated in the city.</p>
<p>The bus was packed with people, and the passengers all focused their eyes on a strangely handsome young man in a Western suit sitting in the right corner. He was holding a bouquet of flowers in his hand, and next to him sat a companion — a strangely beautiful woman.</p>
<p>Following the gaze of the crowd, I also cast my eyes on them, and couldn't help but laugh out loud. Wasn't this strangely handsome young man actually a beautiful girl dressed as a man? The wheels of the bus kept moving forward, and many people were paying attention to this "fake husband." Her demeanor was so natural, not containing any trace of shyness!</p>
<p>Hongkou Park arrived, and we followed a crowd of people, including the fake husband, into the gate of the park.</p>
<p>Again, I stepped onto Old Target Road, which was being destroyed along with Greater Shanghai, to visit one of my classmates — a famous writer. After the classmate's repeated invitations, I went to a luxurious restaurant with some artistic atmosphere. At a round table covered with a silk tablecloth, we were drinking and chatting lightly, placing my insignificant self in the palace of art. When the glass door opened, two fashionable young people came in. My friend greeted the taller one and, at the same time, with a surprised look, greeted the shorter one with a delicate face, saying:</p>

<h3>Fourth Company Commander of the Northeast</h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Six: Sweet and Bitter Love Field, Coldly Observing Two Faces, Rugged Worldly Path, Secret Agreement for Three Years</p>
<p>At this time, the lady was all smiles, seemingly forgetting about the demonstration she had just participated in, shouting "Down with Japanese Imperialism!" Moreover, she was as gentle as water, not like someone with such passionate and heroic spirit. As they walked, only to see Ms. Huang's hand, had already inserted into the company commander's armpit, and her head, just kept tilting, also tilted into the company commander's arms. Looking at it, how sweet, does life in this world, not need a member of the opposite sex, to comfort you for a while? Zhao Ziqiang followed the two company commanders onto the tram in a daze, just thinking deeply. Yin Deren took a tram ticket and stuffed it into his hand, laughing: What's wrong, Lao Zhao? What are you thinking about? You see Xiao Tian so happy, do you also want to find one like that? You are ready-made. Guan Yaowu said: What's wrong, does Lao Zhao also have a lover? Zhao Ziqiang suddenly straightened up and replied: Nonsense! Where do I have such a person? Yin Deren said: A person is not like that, but he has a neighbor... Guan Yaowu laughed: There is an old maid, who is very virtuous. Zhao Ziqiang said in a low voice: Don't talk about it on the tram, okay? Seeing his appearance, Guan Yaowu thought that there was indeed some mystery inside, and after a laugh, he suppressed the matter. They took the tram to the Southwest Gate, changed to a long-distance bus to Haidian, and were always in the midst of crowded passengers, unable to talk about the old maid again. Until they got off the long-distance bus and walked towards Zhao Ziqiang's house. Yin Deren said: Brother Guan, really, his neighbor, that old maid, is very good. Every time he goes home, it's really killing two birds with one stone, one is... Zhao Ziqiang glared at him and said: Lao Yin, if you dare to say it, if you dare to say it, aren't you afraid of committing a sin? Yin Deren laughed: Let's not mention your neighbor, I want to ask you a frank question, are you willing to marry or not? Zhao Ziqiang said: If I have to suffer like Lao Guan, I would never want to marry for a hundred lifetimes. Guan Yaowu then sighed and said: I won't marry a woman. Today, I can't even pay for the tram fare to go home with the two of you, hey! Speaking of it, it's really upsetting. Yin Deren laughed: Lao Guan, what are you in a hurry for? He hasn't finished saying what he wants to say. The next sentence is like this, if it's as interesting as Xiao Tian, he would be willing to marry a hundred in his lifetime. Zhao Ziqiang laughed: We're almost home, don't say it. (65)</p>
<p>Short story</p>
<h3>Conscription (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Tian Hensen</p>
<p>It was a tranquil village. Although the country was in crisis, many houses had been reduced to ashes under airplane bombs, and many heads had been separated from their bodies under guns and bayonets; this village was still very tranquil. Only a few people who occasionally went to the city faintly heard talk of fighting, but they didn't quite understand who was fighting whom. At that time, they couldn't help but be instinctively surprised, eager to ask acquaintances where the fighting was taking place and how far it was from here. And after hearing that the fighting was taking place far from here, they were relieved and didn't bother to investigate who was fighting whom. When they returned to the village, they naturally talked about it with the villagers, but everyone was the same, only asking how far away it was, and then not talking much about it. Everyone didn't feel any fear or interest in it.</p>
<p>It was even more tranquil at night. Because it was dark, everyone had already eaten dinner and was preparing to go to bed. When eating dinner, they often ate while watching the sun set in the west, so very few people lit lamps and went to bed. The nights were even more tranquil, with only the sound of dogs barking occasionally, as tranquil as if the city had declared martial law in the middle of the night.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a thunderbolt shattered the tranquility of the village, causing instant chaos. Many families were crying, and only the families of old women Li and fathers San who had no sons, and old men Yang and fathers Zhang who only had daughters, were somewhat quieter. At first, they were equally shocked by the thunderbolt, equally startled, as if it was the end of the world; later, they heard that it was conscription, and then they understood. Those without sons or with only daughters were completely exempt from this suffering. However, the son-in-law of old man Yang was on the list to be conscripted; his daughter suddenly cried and came back; old man Yang realized and became anxious again!</p>
<p>Old man Yang's daughter's childhood name was Little Dog. She was used to being called by her childhood name, and even when she grew up, she was still called Dog Girl. Because she was the only daughter, and her mother died when she was five years old, she was very spoiled, and he was reluctant to marry her off, planning to recruit a son-in-law. But he didn't agree to those who were too good, and old man Yang didn't want to recruit those who were too bad. Those who were good weren't willing to be Yang's son-in-law, so Dog Girl was left until she was twenty-five years old. Her widowed aunt and paternal aunt both advocated that she couldn't be delayed any longer, and persuaded her father to change his mind, that he didn't necessarily have to recruit a son-in-law. Only then did they rely on a matchmaker to arrange for her to marry Little Bull, the second son of Liu Sanye in the same village, resulting in a marriage between a bull and a dog.</p>
<p>The son-in-law, Little Bull, happened to be the same age as Dog Girl, and his appearance wasn't bad. He just had a few pockmarks on his face, but they weren't too unsightly. Dog Girl had only been married for three months and was quite satisfied, and she hadn't said anything bad about him in front of her father. But old man Yang was always worried that Liu Sanye had three sons. Now there were only two daughters-in-law. When the fourteen-year-old youngest son also got married, it would inevitably be a bit difficult to be a daughter-in-law.</p>
<p>However, Dog Girl wasn't worried about these things, because her eldest sister-in-law was a very good person. She was currently enjoying the sweet wine of her new marriage, unexpectedly encountering conscription, forcing her husband to leave her to go to the battlefield. This thunderbolt almost shook her soul out of her body. After crying for a while at home, there was nothing she could do, so she cried to her father.</p>
<p>"Why are you crying like this? Speak properly!" Old man Yang frowned and asked.</p>
<p>"Dad, don't you know? Little Bull is being forced to go to war, and he's leaving tomorrow, Dad! What's going on?" Dog Girl's crying stopped for a moment when she spoke, and she cried again when she said the last sentence.</p>
<p>"Oh! Little Bull was conscripted! I had already expected it just now, Little Bull has three brothers, one of them will have to be conscripted. What is Little Bull doing now?"</p>
<p>"Little Bull doesn't want to go, but the committee in the city won't agree, and he can't help himself. Dad! Do you have any good ideas?" Dog Girl stopped crying again and looked up at old man Yang. Her two eyes, soaked in tears, were full of hope and a pleading look.</p>

<h3>From Sheng Xuanhuai to Justified Oppression</h3>
<p>— Ding Meng</p>
<p>The Sheng family's ancestors accumulated a lot of virtue, so their descendants held two grand ceremonies to "recover lost territory": one was under Yuan Shikai's Republic of China government, and the other is under the current National Government.</p>
<p>In the early years of the Republic, Sheng Xuanhuai was said to be the number one traitor, and his family property was confiscated. Soon, it seems after the Second Revolution, it was returned. That was not strange, because Yuan Shikai was "hurt by the same kind," he himself was also a traitor. Aren't we commemorating May Seventh and May Ninth every year? Yuan Shikai signed the Twenty-One Demands, there is real evidence of his betrayal.</p>
<p>Recently, I found this piece of news in the newspaper, roughly saying: "The Sheng family's property has long been ordered to be returned, such as the Lingering Garden in Suzhou, and the pawnshops in Jiangyin and Wuxi, etc., are currently being processed for return." This really surprised me. After inquiring, I heard that when the National Revolutionary Army first arrived in Huning in the sixteenth year of the Republic of China, Sheng's family property was confiscated again; the crime this time was probably "local tyrant and evil gentry." Gentry is even to "evil," plus the old crime of betrayal, naturally it should be confiscated again. But why is it being returned again?</p>
<p>First, we should not suspect that there are traitors now, because there is no real evidence — people now have long sworn not to sign treaties that humiliate the country, they are not like Sheng Xuanhuai and Yuan Shikai. Second, we are currently raising funds for air donations, which shows that the government's finances are not well-off. So, why?</p>
<p>The result of academic research is that oppression originally has two kinds: one is justified and will always be justified, and the other is unjustified. The justified ones are like forcing the common people to repay high-interest loans and pay land rent; the "reason" for this kind of oppression is written on the notice: "Borrowing money and repaying debts is a principle common to China and foreign countries, renting land and paying taxes is an unchanging rule since ancient times." The unjustified ones are the confiscation of Sheng Xuanhuai's family property, etc.; this method of "oppressing" great gentry may have been justified locally, but it has long become unjustified now.</p>
<p>When I first saw the "Letter to Workers" on May 1st published in the newspaper, saying: "Resist the unjustified oppression of domestic capitalists," I was also surprised. Isn't this advocating class struggle? Later, I thought about it and understood. This is saying that unjustified oppression should be opposed, while justified oppression is not included. As for how it is justified, you will understand when you read on, the following says: "Must be hardworking and endure hardship, step up production... Should especially share the difficulties together, strive for genuine cooperation between labor and capital, and eliminate all disputes between labor and capital." There is also saying that "Chinese workers are not as miserable as foreign workers" and so on. I thought to myself, fortunately I didn't shout out in alarm, things in the world are always reasonable, and so is all oppression. Moreover, although there are very few reasons for dealing with Sheng Xuanhuai and others, there will always be reasons for dealing with workers.</p>
<h3>Untitled</h3>
<p>— Zhao Tianren</p>
<p>Recently, as soon as I see a pen, infinite annoyance and infinite anger immediately rise from my heart. It's as if a wild beast that has been shot by a hunter once and occasionally sees the hunter's incomplete rifle again, when I see a pen, I want to run away, I harbor hostility.</p>
<p>This, I understand myself, my hatred for the pen is not without reason. Indeed, in recent years, the wounds and torments that the pen has given me have really been unbearable.</p>
<p>Friends in my hometown often write letters asking me what exactly I do in Shanghai. Sometimes I humbly say: "I make a living by 'penning' in Shanghai," and sometimes I arrogantly and arrogantly reply: "I am doing cultural movement in Shanghai!" Only God knows what I do in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Life is as dull as a mechanical operation, every morning, in addition to washing my face and brushing my teeth, the first thing I do is to find my pen. I hold my pen, tightly, my eyes, my attention, even my whole body's energy, are concentrated on the tip of the pen, and my brain juice seeps out drop by drop from the tip of the pen. At this time, I have no pain, even no feeling. Because I am just a machine, squeezing out brain juice is not a job, but just an obligation.</p>
<p>Sometimes, when the night is quiet and the moon is bright, I temporarily put down my pen, as if releasing a heavy burden from my shoulders, and drag my heavy feet on the street that sleeps like a dead snake, rushing towards my home. The moon shines overhead, the shadow drags behind me, and the sound of my own footsteps awakens me from a day's fatigue, "What is it all for?" I ask myself, looking at the cold moon, looking at the stars that are winking at people, I often only let out a soft bitter laugh.</p>
<p>Taking a machine as my metaphor, I think, this is the most appropriate. Isn't a machine soulless? Doesn't it only operate naturally according to certain rules? What about me? People say that I am a free person with a soul, and I myself don't seem to feel that I am not a free person with a soul. But, when I pick up a pen, questions immediately arise in my mind, am I a free person with a soul? I can't help but say what I don't want to say, and I can't say what I want to say. My will, my thoughts, my freedom, are all imprisoned at this time. I am just a loudspeaker, an echo, even a mobile typewriter. I remember Bernard Shaw once said, "In capitalist society, everyone auctions themselves off, women auction their bodies, and men auction their souls." Whenever the night is late and quiet, I think back to the day's events, and I vaguely hear my auctioned soul crying and complaining to me, and I vaguely see several masks on my face, so I scratch my face with all my strength, I am ashamed, I regret, and finally I cry bitterly.</p>
<p>For the sake of life, I auctioned off my soul, for the sake of life, I auctioned off my youth. I eat my own brain juice, chew my own soul, is it bitter? Is it astringent? Only I myself know. God, is this life? Thus, every time I see a pen, I harbor hostility, I want to run away, but until now I still have to find my pen every day, hold it, tightly. I think, one day I will have to put down this crap, one day I will have to call back my soul.</p>
<h3>Dantian</h3>
<p>— Cao Juren</p>
<p>Below the navel, there is a wonderful place, technically called "Dantian" "Dantian" is a unique and precious place. Baopuzi says: Midnight and midday are the times when heaven and earth generate energy; sit cross-legged facing east, deeply inhale into the body, slowly send it into the Dantian, and then slowly exhale. When learning, guide the breath into the nose, practice breath counting, counting one, two, three, four, up to one hundred and twenty times, then slowly exhale it. Because the amount of air inhaled must be finer than the amount of air exhaled, so specially place a feather on the nose to check whether it moves. Apply this breath counting to walking, and if you can ensure the air is inhaled, then you will begin to have some effect. Ji Shuye said: "Breathe and exhale, nourish the body; body and spirit are close, inside and out are complete. Inaction is self-attainment, body is subtle and mind is profound; you can compare longevity with Xianmen, compete years with Wang Qiao." This secret of cultivation, practiced for a long time, has infinite wonderful uses!</p>
<p>Below the "Dantian", there are also wonderful places, which are said to be related to health preservation; how to preserve health? See the art of the bedroom, and you still have to ask Mr. Ye Dehui, but unfortunately he is already dead. According to the news in Shanghai newspapers, such as the old painter in Suzhou sucking a virgin's something something, and a certain boss in Shanghai eating a virgin boy's something something, the reporters' vivid descriptions are like they had seen it with their own eyes; then in addition to the art of the bedroom, there is also this method of collecting and replenishing that goes hand in hand with exhalation and guidance. To exhale, to bedroom, to collect and replenish, all are nothing more than wanting to become immortal, as for the pale and thin faces of the virgin boys and girls, that is not in question.</p>
<p>Those who cultivate also say that speaking should not exceed the throat gate; too much talk damages energy, speaking from the chest or abdomen will greatly deplete vital energy, this secret of health preservation is exactly the opposite of the breathing method, one seeks depth, one seeks shallow output, each obtaining wonderful use. Also, sadness and anger are enough to shake the spirit; those who have attained enlightenment always have a smiling face, with Maitreya Buddha as proof. Speaking of it, in the end, the main point is to cultivate the "Dantian".</p>
<p>The ancients said: "If one son attains enlightenment, even chickens and dogs become immortals," the "Dantian" must be guided, collected, and replenished to cultivate it. Some say: "I often travel between Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Guangdong, Fujian, Hunan, and Hubei, and I have met many who have 'smiling faces and speak in the mouth', why?" It is said: "These are all enlightened people — although no one sees the cultivation and synthesis, heaven knows the intention! These are all enlightened people!"</p>
<h3>Carrot Top's Whiskers</h3>
<p>— by Jules Renard, translated by Lin Qu</p>
<p>Bathing (Continued)</p>
<p>"Yes," said Carrot Top's Whiskers, "though I don't particularly enjoy doing this. Water gets in my ears, and I'll get a headache."</p>
<p>He looked for a place to learn to swim, which meant finding a place where he could move his arms while keeping his knees on the sand as he moved forward.</p>
<p>"You're too impatient," said Lepic to him. "Don't thrash around like you're pulling your hair, clenching your fists and making a fuss. You should also move those legs of yours that you're not using."</p>
<p>"Swimming without using your legs is even harder," said Carrot Top's Whiskers.</p>
<p>But his older brother Felix constantly disturbed him, preventing him from focusing. "Carrot Top's Whiskers, come here. It's deeper here. My feet can't touch the bottom, I'm sinking. Look. Hey: you can still see me now. Be careful: now you can't see me. Now, you stand over by the willow tree. Don't move. I bet I can get to you in just six strokes."</p>
<p>"I'll count for you," said Carrot Top's Whiskers, shivering. His shoulders were above the water, motionless like a real boundary marker. He squatted back down in the water, ready to swim. But Felix climbed on his back, somersaulted into the water, and said to him: "Now it's your turn. You can climb on my back if you want."</p>
<p>"Let me just learn to swim in peace," said Carrot Top's Whiskers.</p>
<p>"Alright," shouted Lepic, "come out, come here and have some sugared wine."</p>
<p>"We're going to have wine!" said Carrot Top's Whiskers.</p>
<p>Now he simply didn't want to come out. He hadn't had enough swimming. The river, which he was now about to leave, no longer frightened him. Just now it had been as heavy as lead, but now it was as light as a feather. He bravely struggled in the water, risking danger, as if he were prepared to sacrifice his life to save someone, and he even willingly submerged himself in the water to experience the torment of those who drown themselves.</p>
<p>"Come on quickly," shouted Lepic, "or your older brother Felix will drink all the sugared wine."</p>
<p>Although Carrot Top's Whiskers didn't particularly like sugared wine, he said:</p>
<p>"I'll never let anyone take my share."</p>
<p>He drank the wine like a battle-hardened soldier.</p>
<p>Lepic: Your bath isn't clean enough. There's still dirt on your ankles.</p>
<p>Carrot Top's Whiskers: It's mud, Papa.</p>
<p>Lepic: No, it's dirt.</p>
<p>Carrot Top's Whiskers: Then should I go back and wash again, Papa?</p>
<p>Lepic: We'll wash tomorrow. We'll come again.</p>
<p>Carrot Top's Whiskers: That depends on luck! We'll only come again if the weather is good!</p>
<p>He dabbed at his body with the dry corner of the towel that Felix had wet. His head was heavy, and his throat was bitter, and he laughed heartily when his brother and Lepic made amusing jokes about his shriveled toes. (Correction) Yesterday, in the twenty-eighth line of "Carrot Top's Whiskers," "apple seed" was a misprint for "apple candy."</p>

<p>Anglo-American Exchange Rate Falls Back</p>
<p>Gold Price Continues to Rise by 8.70 Yuan</p>
<p>Swap Market Approaching Depletion, Process Very Stable</p>
<p>Yesterday's gold market trend continued to be stable. Although there were rumors, people's hearts were extremely stable, and there was not much change. Although large bars of silver were long, the footing was extremely good. The New York silver price did not move, but the exchange rate fell sharply. The forward silver price rose slightly, but there was no significant impact. American cotton fell by 18 points. It opened and immediately rose, and then fluctuated with the exchange market. Colleagues worked hard to balance positions, but because banks' selling interest was not enthusiastic, both the exchange and gold markets saw good signs. The market was closed in the afternoon due to the spring races. The swap market was approaching, and the number of chips was relatively scarce, which contributed to the stability of the gold market. The spot price increased by 62 yuan. The premium for May-June swaps was 94 yuan. The market situation for this half day is recorded below.</p>
<p>The morning opening was 942.70 yuan, slightly higher than the previous close by 2.40 yuan. Goods opened at 2.50 yuan. The exchange market opened with sterling weak and the U.S. dollar tight.

Fuyu sold strips, and retreated to 1.70 yuan, because the banks were tending to block sales. However, people's hearts were still stable. Fuchang Hengyu Hongli entered the market to buy. The exchange market was slightly calmer. U.S. dollars for June at 25 yuan and July at 1.875 yuan were difficult to settle, and rose to 6.50 yuan. Goods were sold. Citibank offered U.S. dollars for July at 1.125 yuan, and for 3.50 yuan. However, because Mitsui purchased U.S. dollars for August at 3.125 yuan, Zhifeng Yongsui came to buy aggressively. At this time, U.S. dollars for August at 3.125 yuan were difficult to settle. Hengyu further increased to 9 yuan. HSBC then blocked August at 25, Fuyu disposed of it, at 7.50 yuan, Yuanmao Yongjin to 8.90 yuan. Afterwards, HSBC announced that the exchange rate was flat and the U.S. dollar fell by 1.125. Huabi offered U.S. dollars for June at 8.75, Fuchang sold strips, dropping to about 6 yuan, with slight fluctuations. The Dalian gang came to sell aggressively, down to 4.50 yuan. Yuanmao Yongcui Taihengxing all entered. HSBC ate U.S. dollars for August at 25, Huabi purchased U.S. dollars for July at 0.0625, rising to 6.20 yuan, but because Citibank offered U.S. dollars for June at 9.375, there were many fluctuations around 5 yuan. Afterwards, colleagues came to purchase aggressively again. Huabi offered U.S. dollars for August at 25, rising to over 6 yuan. Huabi then offered 3.125 for the same month, still at an unfavorable price of 5 yuan.

The highest price for the half day was 949.80 yuan, and the lowest price was 941.70 yuan, fluctuating by only 8.10 yuan. As a result, it rose by 8.70 yuan compared to the previous close.</p>
<p>The posted price was 24.50 yuan, due to HSBC Bank reducing the U.S. exchange rate by 1.125. The alloy price was 979.59 yuan, based on the closing price. It was about 30 yuan less, 3.70 yuan stronger than the previous close. The account price for this month was 977 yuan, and the account price for June was 949 yuan.

<p>Trading in the market was still active, but sometimes sporadic. In summary, Hengxing Shunli Fuyu Yuanchun Neixing, Fuyu and other shops were on the selling side, and Qingfa Yong Hongli Zhifeng Yongcui Tai Yuansheng Yong Daxing Yongyifeng Yong Wanxing and others were on the buying side. The Dalian Gang and Guangdong Gang did not have wholesale transactions. The total amount of strips for June was 15,556.</p>

<p>Silk and Tea Silk Sales Clear During the Spring Races</p>
<p>丨85 bales of spot silk traded丨</p>
<p>Yesterday, the silk market in this port was only open for half a day due to the Spring Races.

<p>Su and Zhejiang Spring Silkworm Season Approaching</p>
<p>(Nanjing) In each previous silkworm season, the Silkworm Improvement Association distributed improved varieties, and graduates from the Silkworm Department of Jinling University went to various silkworm areas to guide breeding, with better results. This year, the rural economy is in a state of panic, and the mulberry trees are producing leaves later. Farmers are very indifferent to silkworm affairs. Although there is breeding in various townships and Xiaodanyang near the city, the number of silkworm eggs is reduced. The weather is sunny and warm, and the improved varieties being bred are developing smoothly. The students are still going to various townships as usual to guide the progress. The early batch has already reached the stage of big sleep and abundant leaves, and the late batch is still in the third sleep and opening leaves.</p>
<p>(Chang'an) The earliest place is near Xucun and other places. Although most of the native silkworms being bred were abandoned due to the bad weather, the remaining healthy silkworm eggs are developing well due to the sunny and warm weather and have large eyes and abundant leaves, and there are occasionally small clusters of cocoons being made. However, the improved silkworms being re-bred have undergone good development and are healthy after the first sleep. The early batch will also enter the fourth sleep and start spinning, and the late batch will have the third sleep and opening leaves in three or four days, and new cocoons will soon be available on the market.</p>
<p>Few Silk Cocoon Firms in Hangzhou and Shaoxing Have Been Rented Out</p>
<p>Only 30% of the usual number</p>
<p>Some silk merchants contracted to purchase</p>
<p>The spring cocoon season in Hangzhou and Shaoxing has arrived, but few cocoon firms in various counties have been rented out. In previous years, all of them had been rented out by this time. This year, the cocoon firms in Linping, Yuhang, Pingyao, Gongbu, Shaoxing, Zhuji, Xinchang, Chang'an, Haining and other counties have only been rented out to 30% of the usual number. The opening of the scales is imminent, but few people are exchanging cocoon posts. According to statistics, no more than 50 cocoon firms in Hangzhou and Shaoxing have been officially rented to silk cocoon merchants to open the scales to collect cocoons. Some have borrowed money from Shanghai silk merchants to contract for drying and unraveling.</p>
<p>Artificial Silk Sales Scattered</p>
<p>Yesterday, the artificial silk market in this port was only open for half a day, and the exchange rate was stable, and the sales were still clear. Only Shanghai silk factories and Su gangs purchased 18 boxes of green goldfish head No. 2 beauty brand and other current futures for this month, priced from 183.25 yuan to 169.5 yuan net.</p>
<p>Wenzhou New Green Tea Officially Opens</p>
<p>Since new goods from Wenzhou, Suian, Tuzhuang and other places have been successively launched on the tea market of foreign firms in this port, both Chinese and foreign parties have been holding back for a week due to concerns about the ups and downs of the market. This depressing situation is unprecedented in recent years. Seeing this situation, Chinese tea merchants had to make concessions again and again. Yesterday, Xiehe Tongfu and other firms launched 155 boxes of Wenzhou new green tea. Zhenmei opened at 73 yuan to 80 yuan for the first batch, and Zhenxian opened at 50 yuan to 58 yuan. On average, the price was more than 20 yuan lower than last year. However, the Zhenxian market was slightly more active than Zhenmei. New teas from Suian and Tuzhuang are also expected to continue to open in the coming days.</p>
<p>New Tea in Dexing Has Been Picked and Packaged</p>
<p>The tea leaves in Dexi County have been sprouting quite long recently. In the areas where troops are stationed on both the upper and lower Dexing roads, the mountain households, considering it a pity to abandon the tea leaves, have chosen to pick the best ones early. In places where there are no stationed troops, many cannot be made on time. It is estimated that the tea production in Dexi County this year will be slightly higher than last year.</p>
<p>Wuyuan First Tea Qi Gang Opened the Garden</p>
<p>New tea in the four townships of Wuyi County was usually picked before the beginning of summer in previous years. This year, the tea buds have been developing later due to the cold and rainy weather on Qingming Day. The mountain tea is only showing silver peaks. Yesterday, the weather cleared up, and the tea needles were drawn out quickly. The tea trees in Zhouyuan suddenly looked green. The mountain households are deeply concerned that the picking and making will not be completed in time as the beginning of summer is approaching. Households with a shortage of tea and labor, and the early tea in the northeast, have all opened the garden today (3rd) to rush to pick as soon as possible. The mountain households in the southwest are currently busy preparing to go to the market and can also pick and make tea in the coming days.</p>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the source was 50 to 60 stores, and the retail and wholesale sales were sluggish. Few customers from the local and visiting gangs made purchases, resulting in few transactions. The market situation was quiet. Although the sellers tightened their grip, they were unable to reverse the decline due to sluggish sales. As a result, the market price of Su Tong粳 and Nanhang thick rice fell by several points to corners. The thin rice was relatively soft due to the large source and the northern ocean gang only handling 3 loads of Qing Si and other thin rice, totaling 400 to 500 bags. It is said that the reason for the sluggish sales of visiting customers is that one is the lack of northern ocean liners, and the other is that there is a wild rumor in Luanxi, which has affected the visiting customers and they have no intention of buying more. However, observing the market situation, it seems to be in a state of fluctuation. It is difficult to predict whether it will rise or fall sharply, and it is difficult to say for sure. Du Yang pointed at the 粳 with a small number of points, and the Changbang 粳 was also showing signs of softening. The Yin Yuan sales turned sluggish, and the market price fell by a corner or so. However, the change Yuan was in short supply and did not suffer any losses.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, more than 30 ships arrived from various gangs downstream. The white 粳 was sold faintly, and the market was high-priced and medium-priced, but recently tired. The thin rice was high-priced and the next tired, the early rice was flat and positive, and all the tips were still showing a fixed trend. The Yin Bian Yuan arrived with a small amount and was sold sluggishly, and the price was soft.</p>
<p>Min Bang Is Selling Hunan Coarse Rice Smoothly</p>
<p>丨丨 Foreign Rice Min Hua Is Also Prosperous 丨丨</p>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign passenger coins were still prosperous, and Fuzhou was the most greedy for sales. The Fuzhou gang was even more enthusiastic about handling goods yesterday. In addition to handling foreign passenger coins, they also selected a batch of Hunan coarse rice, totaling more than 3,000, which was Hunan coarse red rice, priced at 7 yuan and 5 cents. Fuzhou also went to Jiangxi for 400 bags of machine early rice, priced at 7 yuan and 5 corners and 7 cents, and 6 yuan and 6 corners for the second, and 800 bags of machine late rice, priced at 8 yuan and 3 corners to 7 yuan and 9 corners and a half. This street only entertained more than 100 bags of Jiangxi machine yuan rice, and the Wenzhou gang also went to more than 100 bags, priced at 9 yuan and 4 corners and 4 cents, and 9 yuan and 4 cents for the second. The market conditions were similar to the previous market, but the market was very good, because the customer gang's appetite was greedy and smooth. However, due to the very sufficient stock, the hoarders wanted to sell it due to the hot weather, so the price could not rise. Yesterday, 1,500 bags of small twisted rice and 200 bags of Saigon No. 1 rice were opened, and were sold by Anli Foreign Firm and others. Fuzhou sold 1,000 bags of small twisted rice, and the rest were sold by this street. The price was also fixed, 7 yuan and 6 corners to 7 yuan and 5 corners and a half for the small twisted rice, and 8 yuan and 2 corners and a half for the Saigon rice.</p>
<p>Chicago Wheat Slightly Down</p>
<p>On Monday (8th), Chicago wheat initially rose due to the strong stock market, and then fell due to the closing of long positions. The transaction volume on the previous day was 50 million bushels. Closing Price Compared to Previous Day</p>

<p>July Futures 73.25 Down 0.75</p>

<p>Soybean Oil Slightly Up, Cake Sales Still Active</p>
<p>Since the price of soybean oil has fallen, people's hearts have slightly recovered. Yesterday, the market opened with 210 pieces of Dalian oil from the liner, priced at 15 yuan and 3 corners, slightly up by a corner. It is difficult to be optimistic that Bo Wei is not so smooth.</p>
<p>Soybean Cake</p>
<p>The sales are still active, and although the factory cake is still tightly tightened, the source of customers is constant, and the market situation is stable. It is not easy to make big changes in the short term.</p>
<p>Sugar Market Coarse Sand White Rises with the Gold Mark</p>
<p>丨5 points better than the previous day丨</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market tended to tighten as the gold mark rose by about 10 yuan. The guild's market price was 24 yuan for coarse sand and white ordinary goods. The initial market price called out by the sellers was 20 yuan and 1 corner, and the buyers were not satisfied, resulting in no transaction. Later, it was called out at 20 yuan and 0.05 points. The grains with coarser particles were marked with a double T mark at 20 yuan and 1 corner and a half. The Dutch red KNG mark was marked at 16 yuan and 0.05 points. Changxinghang opened the KA on</p>

Also, the Zhishadan Neilun entered the port yesterday, and a batch of coarse sand and white was continued to arrive, totaling 22,576 bags, which was not a large amount.</p>
<p>North-South Goods Daylily Number Plate Opens Up</p>
<p>Daylily has been tightening recently due to the gradual shortage of stock. According to inquiries, there are only 300 bags of number goods in the Shanghai market, and even fewer in the firm's stock. The Cantonese sales have been slightly moving in recent days, and the number plate is becoming firmer. Yesterday, 50 to 60 bags of the upper and middle houses were opened, priced at 19 yuan and 5 corners, which was 3 to 4 corners higher than before. According to the Zhenjiang long-distance telephone, Cantonese and other gangs have been directly purchasing in the local area, so the firm's plate has also been called higher.</p>
<p>Hardware Tinplate Rally After a Sharp Drop</p>
<p>Tinplate was flooded with goods, and the actual sales could not rise. In addition, the exchange rate was loose, causing panic among the colleagues who arrived with the goods and rushing to sell first. As a result, the market price was tired. The cheapest price was 17 yuan and 5 corners for 90 pounds of single-linked British goods, 35 yuan for 180 pounds of double-linked goods, 19 yuan and 7 corners for 100 pounds of single-linked British goods, and 39 yuan and 4 corners for 200 pounds of double-linked goods. However, the actual transactions were still rare. Yesterday, the trend suddenly changed its old appearance. Although the buyers did not see any good or bad advances, telegrams from overseas were constantly rising. For example, 90 pounds per box required 18 shillings and 2 to 10, and 100 pounds required 19 shillings and a half, which was 1 shilling and 4 to 5 higher than the last price. The green is that people's hearts are better, and the cheap goods that disrupted the market were mostly collected by colleagues at one time, and the market price rose by 1 corner to 3 corners. At the moment, a single-linked 90 pounds requires 17 yuan and 6 corners and a half, a double-linked 118 pounds requires 35 yuan and 2 corners, a 100-linked single pound requires 20 yuan, and a double-linked 200 pounds requires 39 yuan and 7 corners. It is said that 300 to 400 boxes were purchased by various gangs in Tianjin and the Yangtze River.</p>
<p>Cloth Store Sichuan Gang Searched for Huanghua Special呢</p>
<p>Xiang Yugong, Yiji, Xiejixing, Yiheyuyu and other Sichuan gang's resident Shanghai Zhuang, searched for Huanghui Huatene, priced at 4 yuan and 2 corners. The general runners and brokers of the Yihui Association inquired each other. According to the inquiries, the new goods of Huanghui plain Huatene were not supplied much, and the old goods had already been purchased by the gang. As a result, only a few were obtained. The current stock in the market is only two types, Huaitai and Ningfeng, but they all want to add other colors before agreeing to the transaction. Even if a single bare yellow is 1 corner a yard higher, the firm is unwilling to ship the box.</p>

<p>Talk</p>
<h3>Sometimes</h3>
<p>— Lin Huiyin</p>
<p>"Forgive me, God, please take back all my heat, all my light," the sun pleaded wistfully.</p>
<p>Since being created, who knows how many years have passed, the sun has always stood there, motionless. However, what he finds annoying is not just his own motionless standing, but also the Earth's ceaseless rotation; because, if there were no rotation, perhaps he wouldn't feel the pointlessness of his standing. Moreover, the Earth rotates so monotonously, so unchangingly. If he himself could rotate, he believed he could rotate in some different ways. Sometimes he got so angry that he wouldn't look at the Earth, closing his eyes tightly. But as soon as he opened his eyes, he saw the Earth again, and saw the Earth's rotation.</p>
<p>"Oh, tirelessly rotating Earth, you actually rotate so tirelessly!"</p>
<p>Sometimes, he was angry with himself, condemning himself: "You stupid thing, can you only be so fixed?" So he used all his strength, only wanting to spin once. But there was no effect.</p>
<p>"What's the point of living like this?" He began to doubt life. "If I can only live like this, I'd rather not live," he made his final decision.</p>
<p>But he still stood there rigidly, only emitting heat, only emitting light. Finally, he saw that there was no hope for himself, so he shouted out the plea to destroy his own life:</p>
<p>"Forgive me, God, please take back all my heat, all my light."</p>
<h3>Saving the Nation and Saving Hearts</h3>
<p>— Ding Hua</p>
<p>Since the Japanese invaded and occupied the Eastern Provinces, due to the many patriotic compatriots, the methods of saving the nation that have been widely spread in society have also emerged endlessly and have been new every day. What with saving the nation through recreational performances, saving the nation through donations, it is really too much to write about and too much to remember. A says: If China wants to resist Japan, it must first develop the resources of the country, so that the economy is not worried about lack, and can safely resist the enemy without any worries. B advocates that if China wants to resist foreign aggression, it must first expand its military force. C says that purchasing a large number of aircraft and training aviation talents is the only shortcut to resisting aggression. Some people are also proposing to reorganize the Chinese navy. Everyone has their own views and issues their own brilliant theories. But can this handful of national salvation policies really save China?</p>
<p>Let us think carefully. If the development of China's resources becomes a reality, and China is indeed very rich, but who knows if these people in power and those who control the government will no longer be solely profit-oriented, fighting for power and gain with each other, and be able to use the abundance of the economy to engage in resistance against aggression and recuperation? I'm afraid the result will only be to increase the large amounts of deposits that the important people put in foreign banks, and issue a few more exorbitant taxes. As for expanding the military, even if one day, China's army, navy, and air force become elite troops, and all kinds of firearms are manufactured to be very sophisticated, who dares to guarantee that these people who hold military power will unanimously point their guns outwards and no longer fight among themselves? I'm afraid that once they start fighting again, because of the sophistication of the firearms and the strength of the soldiers, the suffering of our ordinary people will be several times worse than before and now; in this way, national affairs will be in even worse shape, so how can we talk about resisting aggression and saving the nation?</p>
<p>Therefore, in the current China, what it urgently needs is still "saving hearts"! Why did Zhang Xueliang not resist? Why did Tang Yulin abandon Rehe and flee? Why was Hu Lifu willing to be a traitor? Why was Puyi willing to be a Japanese puppet? Why did the people inside the Guan watch the suffering of their compatriots outside the Guan without offering help? All these things are because the hearts of those involved have problems, or have undergone abnormal changes, so to resist aggression and save the nation, we must start with saving hearts!</p>
<p>What is meant by saving hearts is, in a small sense, to transform a lazy heart into a diligent one, a non-resistant heart into a resistant one, a heart that only cares about personal gain into a heart that only cares about public gain, and a heart that is brave in internal warfare into one that is brave in resisting aggression. In a larger sense, transform four hundred million different hearts into one. When that time comes, everyone will be willing to do things based on their conscience, internal wars will be eliminated, and all industries will prosper. Using this to resist aggression, what aggression cannot be eliminated? Using this to attack the enemy, what enemy cannot be destroyed?</p>
<p>"There is no greater sorrow than the death of the heart." In the current China, the work of saving hearts is at least more urgent, necessary, and effective than other national salvation policies!</p>
<p>Literary Arts</p>
<h3>May</h3>
<p>— Yan</p>
<p>May has a scant thirty-one days, painful commemorations occupy seven, treat approaching enemies like formidable foes and defend against laborers like soldiers, beside the Lu kingdom city is a miserable white cold, on Nanjing Road is a fresh red overflow, Don't mention the heartbreaking May 7th and 9th, in one month there are three times of kneeling down. Wireless</p>
<p>The scene vaguely resembles peace and prosperity, every household broadcasts music, enjoy today's pleasure today, don't wait until the country is lost for the song to be unfinished.</p>
<h3>Pessimism and Optimism</h3>
<p>— Jin Zhi</p>
<p>In times of chaos, pessimistic thoughts are most likely to occur and spread. As soon as we sense some kind of social or personal unease, we will cry out, "Life is too meaningless!" In reality, we are all a bunch of numb people, otherwise, in this kind of unfair environment, what wouldn't make us heartbroken? We seem to be traveling in a graveyard full of dead bodies, what we see and hear is either tragic or miserable. Tragic scenes cannot be described by pen and ink. Everything around is narrow, selfish, and a despicable illusion. People no longer believe in ideals; immediate benefits seem to be the ideals and motives of most people. The question of right and wrong is not a question; the question is whether it is beneficial or not. If it is beneficial, I will do it; if it is not beneficial, no matter how noble the ideal or cause, I will never approve of it. This is the inner thought of those who call themselves progressive people recently. How can this situation not make people pessimistic? No wonder a floating, romantic life has become a fashionable life. "Floating! I am now like duckweed in the sea, floating with the wind, not knowing where the other shore is?" So-called new poets often have these kinds of similar sentences. "I hate life! I would rather go to a deserted place and live a pure and free life. Life is too ugly, where is my beautiful paradise? I want to seek my paradise! I want to be separated from this evil world!! Never see humans, who look like animals but are not animals and are called 'the spirit of all things'!" When we write articles, we can write these sentences, and we will definitely get the sympathy of the public. Yes, everyone is bathing in the sea, and烦恼 is a modern-day epidemic. People want to get rid of烦恼, so they often send out those cries. Everyone wants to be happy, everyone doesn't want to struggle in pain, but pain often accompanies them, choking their throats every step of the way. No wonder they are running on the road of pessimism!</p>
<p>In the eyes of pessimists, everyone is evil, and human society cannot be transformed. They often laugh at social idealists for meddling, and often regard revolutionaries as madmen. "Life is a painful natural history," "Survival is evil," the world's philosophers tell us. But since we are born into the world, can we just curse life like this? Can we just hate people like this? Do we have no way to seek an elixir to reduce pain in pain? What is the use of pessimism! Let's move forward as soon as possible! Pessimists, please put down your depressed hearts and strive to move straight on the road to improving life! Sighing long and hiding in the mountains and forests is ultimately useless.</p>
<p>The privileged people of the present world are used to living in one-sided happiness, often wearing red-colored glasses, thinking that life is most blessed. Pain? Sorrow? Although they sometimes have pain and sorrow due to family discord and the failure of speculative businesses, they usually think that social reformers are making a fuss about nothing when they speak out for the poor. In their minds, everyone in the world seems to be as happy and happy as they are. Destroying their comfort is a rebellious act! This is what the saying goes, "When you are full, you don't know that others are hungry!" Beautiful women! Fine wine! Luxury cars! Angry horses! They have everything, how can they say that life is painful?</p>
<p>These people are ignorant and unfeeling pig-like optimists! They are extremely optimistic about life. Because they are deaf, they cannot hear the cries of the miserable world.</p>
<p>But, some other people have a special thought, thinking that everything in humanity is good, and even the most evil things, in their view, are also an expression of goodness. Although they are not privileged, they do not hate life either. They see all phenomena as gifts from nature. We should not think too much or worry too much. We just need to live by fate. Whether the result is good or bad, we don't need to meddle. Good things will be good, and bad things, you can worry to death and it will be useless: so it is better to implement the idea of "enjoy today's wine today, and worry about tomorrow's money tomorrow," which is much more thorough. There are also countless of these people in today's society. We cannot name them, but we call them muddleheaded, inexplicable optimists.</p>
<p>These people are also enemies of revolution. They feel that revolution will disturb their clear dreams of enjoyment, and it is better to live in a drunken乡. If the future of mankind is good, then naturally we don't need to make any serious efforts, and it will be good. So let's just be sloppy! They take sloppiness as their slogan, and everything can be done with the four characters of sloppiness. Pity! Advocates of sloppiness!</p>
<p>Can life be optimistic? Where can we be optimistic? We only need to look at the current phenomenon, and we will be full of sorrow.</p>
<p>Pessimistic? Optimistic? If we carefully examine humanity, we feel that pessimism and optimism are really not needed in humanity. People have good and evil, construction and destruction, noble and despicable. In short, the road of evolution needs people to explore.</p>
<h3>Prison Life</h3>
<p>— Yan Zhao</p>
<p>Several old-fashioned Chinese houses, with clumsy wooden fences arranged under the eaves, the light in the room is not very sufficient; not only is it not sufficient, it is simply dark. The people in the room are lying all over the place, even the corners are crowded. They are all very haggard, their hair is as fluffy as autumn weeds, and their skin is as yellow and thin as fallen leaves; their faces seem to be about to burst into tears, and the state of weariness, depression, worry, and indignation is self-evident. Their bodies seem to be weak, and their hands and feet are also very weak; some of them also have heavy iron chains tied to their ankles, so they can't walk at all. These are probably people with heavier sins.</p>
<p>The entire room is filled with evil atmosphere, which may be the reason why people living in prison life have no vitality. Here, the cage is so small, the place is so dirty, the people are so crowded, and life is so unfree, how can it not evolve into decadence and depression, to the point of closing one's eyes and dying?</p>
<p>Their food and drink cannot be said to be delicacies from mountains and seas; even vegetarian dishes are difficult to fill your stomach. What's even worse is at night, when they should be able to sleep for a while to nourish their overly tired and exhausted bodies and spirits, but the lice, as numerous as hairs, come to bother them! The old 百虱 doesn't care about your life or death, clamps onto you with one bite, and doesn't let go until death, trying its best to eat and suck your precious blood, sucking until it is full and then quietly hiding in the seams of your clothes; the jumping flea敏捷ly uses its innate jumping ability, jumps into the chest of the big guy, then jumps into the arm of the young man, and then jumps to the leg of the old man, jumping back and forth, jumping all over the cage, sucking all the blood from everyone's body; the cunning bedbug is even more恶人, even more sneaky and辣泼, every time when the night is deep and people are quiet, it secretly drills out from the floor seams to disturb their dreams and牛drink their朱殷. They can't bear it anymore, they jump up forcefully, crying sadly. And no one will pity them, still剥削ing the bloody blood from their bodies and muscles.</p>
<p>Outside the fence stood a majestic and awe-inspiring prison guard, with piercing eyes, watching the inside of the fence. He doesn't allow you to speak, and even less does he allow you to move. If you accidentally say a word, he will immediately叱然吆喝, scaring you out of your wits. If a few people with more courage still want to say a few more words, he will send you a heavy and painful beating with a big stick.</p>
<p>They have no years, no months, no mornings, no evenings, imprisoned in this prison, unable to see the blue sky, unable to see the sun and moon, dimly,阴霾霾, passing the confusing 光阴. Freedom of speech is not allowed, and thoughts have no freedom, and actions are even less free, as if sitting in a檻穽, enduring that restrained life. 丨丨Life is difficult, and death is impossible.</p>
<p>It is said that the prison here is our noble country, and the people in the prison must be the compatriots of our noble country; the life in the prison is naturally the life of our compatriots.</p>
<p>Ah! Compatriots... prison... life...</p>
<p>(In support of donations to righteous troops)</p>
<h3>When is a person considered old?</h3>
<p>— Pei</p>
<p>When is a person considered old?</p>
<p>Sir Walter Scott, at the age of fifty-five, lamented that he had become an old man. The French writer Montaigne retired to his villa at the age of thirty and lived his quiet reading life. The British writer Dr. Samuel Johnson said: A person reaches the peak of his life at the age of thirty-five, and then he has to walk downhill. According to physiology, a person can live to be one hundred to one hundred and fifty years old, so why are people like Scott so young and considered old? The answer is: because they feel old, so their behavior is old. Physiologist William James (WITL J S) said, "Most people become outdated old pines by the age of twenty-five." This statement really grasped the truth. People at the age of twenty-five are mostly satisfied with their careers; they already have "prejudice", which is the so-called "doctrine", and reject all new ideas; they have stopped "growing".</p>
<p>As long as a person stops growing, no matter how old he is, he begins to "age". On the other hand, truly great people are never old. The Italian painter Titian lived to be ninety-nine years old and never stopped painting. Goethe died at the age of eighty-three, completing the great "Faust" a few years before his death. Gladstone was seventy years old when he had to learn a foreign language. The great French mathematician Laplace died at the age of seventy-eight, still working. He shouted before his death: "What we know is nothing, what we don't know is much more!" When is a person considered old? Then you get the real answer. Laplace was still not satisfied when he was seventy, and he was convinced that there was infinite knowledge in the world; he was still "growing"; he was still a young man! A person who can maintain this attitude, and can say "I have grown!" when looking back on the past every year, is a young man. The day he no longer grows, he says to himself, "I have completely acquired the knowledge I need."丨His youth is nearing extinction. No matter whether he is twenty-five years old or seventy-five years old, there is no difference, from that day on, he is considered truly old.</p>
<p>Clerk Correspondence</p>
<p>Dragging People Down</p>
<p>Editor Mr.:</p>
<p>Before I ask you to solve my difficulties, let me first talk about my family situation. I have an old mother, two younger brothers, and two younger sisters. I am the eldest, and I am forty-four years old this year; my father was sacrificed in the "January 28th" battle last year. When he was alive, his monthly salary was more than three hundred yuan; therefore, the family's expenses and the tuition fees of my younger siblings were not a problem. After his death, I! Unfortunate eldest child! I have to take on this heavy burden alone. Although I am a high school graduate, I am currently a small clerk in a company with a monthly salary of thirty yuan. Isn't there a big difference between thirty yuan and three hundred yuan? It is already very difficult to use it to support the family's daily expenses, let alone provide for my younger brother's tuition fees (one in the second year of high school and one still in elementary school), it is really difficult. According to my mother's idea, she wanted to ask my eldest brother to go to work; but I think a person must at least have received a high school education to have common knowledge to stand in society, so I still strongly advocate that he continue to study, although my strength is very weak.</p>
<p>Now let me talk about my difficulties. My colleagues in the company are all playboys, either eating花酒 or gambling. Once, they asked me to join, but I refused. Therefore, they hold a grudge in their hearts and look for my faults everywhere to report to the manager; their intention is a kind of warning, and they are not allowed to refuse any of their orders. Alas! According to their behavior, logically I should advise him as a friend, and if he doesn't listen, I should report it to the manager. Now I am a weak person, and in order to protect this饭碗 that my family of six relies on to live on, I have already taken a policy of non-resistance. They seem to be satisfied; why do they have to drag people down? If this continues, sooner or later my position will be insecure. Thinking of this, it really makes people feel chills; sir, can you point out a bright road and give me some fighting power? I wish you</p>
<p>Good health Shao Fei respectfully</p>
<p>X X X</p>
<p>Editor's Note: For Shao Jun's family, it is indeed very difficult to maintain household expenses with thirty yuan a month. As for a person standing in society, knowledge is of course essential. Your brother is already in the second year of high school, and in another year, he will graduate from high school and come to an end. You are right to advocate that he continue to study until he graduates from high school. As for the tuition fees, it is best if you can raise them; otherwise, you may as well borrow money to achieve it. Borrowing money out of necessity for legitimate tuition fees, people will probably not refuse; for you, this debt, in the future, you may as well ask your brother to share the responsibility of repayment. You should also let your brother know about your painstaking planning; this is not necessarily a basis for him to repay the debt in the future, but at the same time, it is also good to let him know the difficulty of material resources and work hard.</p>
<p>As for the problem between you and your colleagues, we advise you not to worry too much. The reason why they must drag people down is nothing more than a guilty conscience, fearing that you will not only not fool around, but also say their faults. Since you have already embraced the policy of non-resistance, after a long time, knowing your thoughts, they will be able to live in peace. You only need to work hard and avoid mistakes as much as possible. On the side of the employer, even if he does not have the courage to eliminate the playboys, or he himself is a playboy, he will not absolutely be unable to tolerate you!</p>
<p>Finally, we also want to make a minimum demand on Shao Jun's colleagues and other playboys in other places: "Even if you cannot restrain yourself and love yourself, at least don't drag down those who restrain themselves: you must know that even if you let them go, is it harmful to you?"</p>

<h3>The Life of the Five Beauties (5) (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>Five First Time for Gu</p>
<p>No matter how the world mocks them, Miss Liu finally grew up. To her, these long years seemed like a dream. She didn't even know how she grew up. Maybe she deliberately wanted to forget as much as possible, because she often said: "What is this, isn't it just this way?" Then, the corners of her mouth turned down, and she snorted a bitter laugh from her nose. In the eyes of sentimental people, this is very touching and can make them shed tears for her, but over time, it is no longer strange, and it seems that people are bound to do so. In fact, our Miss Liu is not very willing to understand herself. For example, there are often many嫖客搂着 her waist and praising her sadly:</p>
<p>"My little baby, you don't know how beautiful you are! It's really enough to make me crazy."</p>
<p>"Really? Thank you! But, I've heard words like this hundreds of times."</p>
<p>Such an answer is very unsettling, but many too-good men do not think that these words have hurt themselves, and want to sincerely offer a hot heart; this heart must be placed in a gold-quality box and displayed on her dressing table, becoming her beloved treasure.</p>
<p>As for herself, she has long understood this very well. Since she is a prostitute, of course there will be all kinds of嫖客缠绕着 her around, unable to get rid of them, and there is no need to get rid of them. What they give her is the satisfaction of money, and what she gives them is the satisfaction of color and flesh. The exchange between each other is very reasonable. What's more, she has reached the age of maturity, so Master Zhang said that he must梳头 for her, so let him do it. Anyway, she will have to go through this once. Any man is a good opponent, it just depends on who can negotiate a good price with her old woman.</p>
<p>As for the background of Master Zhang, even Wu Gui does not understand it very well. It is said that he was indeed a candidate magistrate who would be released as soon as there was a vacancy, and his cousin was the current Daoyin. However, this has nothing to do with her, but what makes her most happy is that in addition to a pair of gold bracelets weighing three taels, there are also two very large pearls, which can be obtained immediately. She also wanted a gold necklace with a piece of green jade hanging in front, which would be very decent in front of others.</p>
<p>Regarding these things, after a few days of negotiations, because Master Zhang was very generous, everything was quickly settled completely, and waiting for the customized wooden furniture to be moved into her room, she could have a big lively celebration. The date has already been selected as the sixth day of March.</p>
<p>From then on, she was no longer a清官人. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>"Spring River Flower Moon Night" Overwhelms All Sound Films</h3>
<p>— Si Ping</p>
<p>With the Gardens of Europe丨The Scenery of Switzerland as the Backdrop</p>
<p>With the Song Country of the World丨Famous Italian Melodies as the Core</p>
<p>Music, Singing, Mountain Light, Water Colors, Floral Fragrance, Poetic Charm, Romance丨All the beauty in the universe, all the beauty created by nature, can be said to be wonderfully captured in the "Spring River Flower Moon Night" that overwhelms all sound films. At a time when the American film industry is in decline, the Gaomeng Buleidian Film Company is able to grasp the characteristics of the European nation and create something unique, and this extraordinary success is worthy of our enthusiastic praise. The previous trend of European films not being welcomed can undoubtedly be changed by the artistry of "Spring River Flower Moon Night."</p>
<p>The direction, acting, cinematography, scenery, and sound recording of "Spring River Flower Moon Night"丨everything has succeeded to the point of perfection. The beauty of the music and the melodiousness of the singing are undoubtedly the characteristics of this film, and are beyond the reach of all other sound films. When we read a novel or a poem by a genius writer, we often appreciate it so much that we feel refreshed and transformed into a different person. We have the same aesthetic feeling after watching the film "Spring River Flower Moon Night". "Spring River Flower Moon Night" is a masterpiece that elevates the audience's tastes.</p>
<p>The plot of "Spring River Flower Moon Night" is very simple but its meaning is profound. The twists and turns of the story truly have the beauty of "mountains and rivers exhausted, yet another village appears." Its meaning is to depict the unrestrained genius丨the great Italian singer Fularle in the film丨as well as to satirize the ridiculous philistines丨the mayor Panteg in the film. All great literary masters, great poets, great artists, and great opera singers must have absolute freedom in order for their talents to be brought into full play. Talented people cannot rely on philistines, and philistines cannot restrain talented people; otherwise, talent will not be talent, and even if it is talent, it will be buried forever. In this film, the Italian genius singer Fularle is initially unhappy due to being constrained by a female manager. After he escapes midway, he encounters the mayor's entanglement, so he makes the best of the situation and even has his secretary replace him to avoid trouble! This is a depiction of a genius who does not care for fame but loves solitude.</p>
<p>This genius singer uses a "golden cicada shedding its shell" strategy, and the scene of him slowly closing the two large doors becomes a watershed for returning freedom. After that, he roams freely in the gardens of Europe丨at the foot of the mountains and on the shores of the waters of Switzerland. The film shows picturesque mountains and rivers. The beautiful rivers and mountains naturally become the home of genius. Even more poetic and romantic, he encounters a beautiful woman, and in a secluded corner where the mountains and waters meet, among a group of lively and innocent village children, this Italian singer sings loudly, unleashing his overflowing talent. Here, the clear mountains, beautiful waters, birdsong, and floral fragrance blend together seamlessly, and the audience will surely be intoxicated in this musicalized cinematic art. Italy is a world-renowned country of song. Although the songs of "Spring River Flower Moon Night" are recent works, the prelude of the film uses a radio broadcast to sing a long and melodious tune that is very pleasant to the ear. The melody of this song is used as a background music in the subsequent scenes. The second half of the film takes several unmatched songs from classical Italian opera, such as "Le Rêve" and "La Traviata," and sings them in succession through the voice of Kipra, culminating in "La Bohème," giving the audience the rare opportunity to enjoy three famous songs in one film. What's more, before this film, we also hear a symphony by the great German musician Beethoven.</p>
<h3>Review of "Two Seconds"</h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, this is a work that blurs the consciousness of the masses.</p>
<p>Construction worker John, after work, goes to a dance hall to have fun, where he meets a dancer, Xue Lan. In a drunken daze, he hastily marries her. Later, he also accidentally kills a good friend because of his anger at his wife's romantic behavior, and he himself is injured. When he is sick in bed, he is extremely poor and relies entirely on his wife for daily necessities. Because of his wife's confession, he learns that this money comes from her lover, and he is overwhelmed with shame and anger. But he luckily obtains a large sum of money, so he repays his wife's lover and kills him. Later, he surrenders himself to the court and serves his sentence.</p>
<p>Obviously, the screenwriter of this drama has put all his efforts into creating a typical worker who is steadfast, upright, and full of blood; and this worker must not recognize his own way out. Although he is in great pain due to his own economic oppression, he will not doubt whether the current social system is reasonable, and even when he is forced to commit murder, he is still determined to serve his sentence. Naturally, this kind of typical character is very beneficial to the people in the upper echelons of the organization. Therefore, in John's state of confused consciousness, there is actually a pastor who, under the condition that he has considerable income, proves that he does indeed have love for this dancer, and until the end, he does not even object to the existence of this marriage. Later, he loses his job due to illness, and although he is on the verge of desperation, he does not ask for compensation or medical expenses, and believes that love transcends everything and is ashamed of his wife's prostitution. At the time he owes money, he must pay it back, and if there is no way, he can "bet it all" on buying lottery tickets. (And he actually wins.) Of course, if you have money, you must pay back the money, pay back the money first and then kill someone. If you kill someone, you naturally have to serve your sentence without fear. And before you die, you should repent greatly. This is a "hero," this is a "good person" who is praised by gentlemen, and this is the best model for the working masses. Therefore, the screenwriter has created this very reasonable typical character on the screen, and this character is the best victim for maintaining modern laws.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, this typical character must become a preaching tool at the expense of many FILM conditions. But this is not an easy thing either. If you want to make a wide audience receive this kind of anaesthetic, then you must have good skills, and the acting and direction must be very moving. Regarding this point, it is precisely what the authors of "Two Seconds" have strived to achieve. They have faithfully fulfilled their "responsibilities."</p>
<h3>The Educational Film Association Holds Its Second Annual Meeting</h3>
<p>— Bai Hua</p>
<p>The Chinese Educational Film Association held its second annual meeting on the afternoon of the 5th of this month in the auditorium of the Ministry of Education on Chengxian Street in the capital. Members from various provinces were notified in advance to attend. Members from the Shanghai film industry who attended included Shao Zuiweng, Chen Yumei, and Li Yihe from Tianyi Company, Hong Shen and Zhou Jianyun from Mingxing Company, and Jin Qingyu from Lianhua Company. When the meeting began, it was chaired by Chu Minyi. Later, Chu left early due to important matters and was replaced by Duan Xipeng, the Deputy Minister of Education. After the chairman gave his speech, the general affairs, editing, and design groups reported on their work over the past year and distributed the association's publications, including: "Zengwu Report," narrated by Chen Lifu and noted by Wang Pingling, "New Lines for China's Film Industry," written by Sardi and translated by Peng Baichuan and Zhang Peiying, "Film and China," written by Chu Minyi, "Using Film to Promote the Realization of the Three Principles of the People and to Assist Various Undertakings," written by Sardi and translated by Peng Baichuan and Zhang Peiying, "An Overview of the Italian National Educational Film Museum." Next, Yin Zumao, a representative from the Central Party Headquarters, and Duan Xipeng, a representative from the Ministry of Education, gave speeches in succession. Then, Chen Lifu gave a speech. After the speech, it was late, and there was no time to discuss the proposals, so the meeting was adjourned and continued the next morning.</p>
<p>On the morning of the 6th, the meeting continued in the auditorium of the Ministry of Education. Chen Lifu, Peng Baichuan, Fang Zhi, and others proposed "Promoting the Safety of Domestic Films." Guo Youshou, Shao Zuiweng, Hong Shen, Zhou Jianyun, and Jin Qingyu were appointed to draft the proposal. Also, regarding the "Domestic Film Competition Case," it was decided to organize a selection committee, with members recommended by various agencies, including three from the Central Headquarters, one from the Academia Sinica, one from the Central University, two from the Ministry of Interior, two from the Ministry of Education, one from the Film Censorship Committee, and five from the Educational Film Association, totaling fifteen people. It was decided to screen the films on the 8th, with each committee member voting to select one sound film and one silent film. It is reported that the films participating in this competition are "Life Force" and "Two Orphans on the Battlefield" (both sound films) from Tianyi Company, and "Flower of Freedom" (sound film) and "Torrent" (silent film) from Mingxing Company, and "Humanity" (silent film) from Lianhua Company, totaling five films.</p>
<h3>Introduction to "Life Force"</h3>
<p>— Pan</p>
<p>"Life Force," recently completed and soon to be released by Tianyi Company, is a film with women as its subject. Its central consciousness has the following points: eradicating women's dependence on old habits; guiding women's path to struggle; encouraging women to develop a spirit of self-reliance; advocating for women to seek legitimate occupations; and at the same time, deeply and fully exposing the darkness of the current society and the coldness of human relationships. It is truly a good film that benefits society and women. The film will be released soon, and I, with the enthusiasm of supporting domestic films, am writing to introduce it.</p>

<h3>The Secret of Film Novels (SECRETS) (4)</h3>
<p>— Cairo</p>
<p>After some time, Mary was a young woman in a rural village in the American West. Little John had also been born. They lived in a small log cabin, divided into two small rooms, with a fireplace. The primitive-style furniture inside was all made by John himself. The cowhide on the dirt floor and the cradle where little John slept were also John's handiwork. Mary sometimes thought of her girlish life in New England, but she didn't feel any nostalgia or regret. She worshipped the real love life. She recognized that in the past, she only had empty fantasies about love, but now it was filled with sweetness and realized. She had John, and also little John.</p>
<p>She lay on little John's cradle, playing with little John. She said to him: "When you grow up in the future, you will be even greater than your father. Your father will be the governor of this province in the future, but you, you will be the president. Understand? The president."</p>
<p>As she was playing with little John like this, she suddenly heard the sound of horses' hooves in the distance outside the window. John and his assistant, called Shen Xiang, had gone to the neighboring village early that morning to buy food. Could they be back so soon? She listened again, and the sound of the horses' hooves got closer and closer. She ran to the door and opened it wide. Then her face sank. Three men with ferocious faces got off their horses. She took a few steps back in fear. The leader of the three stepped forward and said to Mary, "Hello, I am Jack Hauser, people call me 'Red-Faced Jack'. I'm afraid you've heard of me too."</p>
<p>Mary's face turned pale. She said, "I've heard of you."</p>
<p>"We've come to look for something to eat," the man said with a sneer.</p>
<p>"Don't waste your time, I have nothing, and I can't feed cattle thieves!" After she finished speaking, she pushed the door hard and locked it with an iron bolt. But when she was about to close that small window, a hairy hand had already reached in, and with a bang, a bullet had already flown past. Mary quickly ran over and hugged her child, who was still smiling. The robbers outside shouted, "We want something to eat, I advise you to open the door obediently." Mary hugged the child and slowly opened the door. Red-Faced Jack also introduced the other two: one was his brother, called Doufu, and the other was called Peter. They forced Mary to take out all the food. While they were gorging themselves, Doufu was constantly glancing at the beautiful woman in the countryside. But his appearance was noticed by Jack, who said, "Doufu, this time it's not allowed, you can come back next time."</p>
<p>After they finished eating, suddenly another person ran in and said to Jack: "Boss, the cows have all been rounded up." When Mary heard this, she jumped up and asked, "Cows? Whose cows?" (To be continued)</p>
