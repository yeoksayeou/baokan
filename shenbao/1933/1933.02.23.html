<h3>時評</h3>
<p>日本退出國聯之推測</p>
<p>（一）日本對國際現勢之謬見</p>
<p>日本乘世界經濟恐慌達於極點歐美各國亟於自救之際借口特殊利益及防止赤化。不　間襲佔遼吉延至北滿西及錦義英法各國初亦偏聽日方之飾詞。我國則僅空言抵抗。未嘗實際用兵是以公理。而事實仍歸事實。</p>
<p>今年正月元日輸關事變發生守土將領似皆抛棄已往［不抵抗］主義而從事於奮戰。列國亦漸明悉日帝國主義者侵略之野心。與獨占中國市塲之企圖。故十九國委員會。乃起草報告書。宣告對中日糾紛調</p>
<p>約第十五條之第四項。此事雖尚未經過國聯大會通即令通過。其實行力究竟何如。目前亦不必多事推究。惟國際間對日本表示應遵重公約。已可概見。而日本之軍國主義者對世界現勢之觀察則殊與常人異趣。　　［第］日本認國聯絕無實力最大限度亦僅能起於和解止於勸告蓋以爲資本主義各國。利害觀念各自不同安能以英法指揮下之國聯染指遠東。干涉彼擁有强大海陸軍之日本。</p>
<p>第二勸告案縱使成立。日本爲當事國之一。儘可置之不理英法各國實際利害。旣各不同則欲運用盟約第十六條以經濟封鎖日本勢不可能。　　第三彼積一年半以來之經騐與其歷史上之敎訓中國正當内紛未已之際。［勇私怯公。］殆已成爲民族慣性。抵抗亦徒託［熔空言。　第四，英美對立形。勢並未减輕。戰債問題。即爲其當前之癌腫。况市場爭奪。投資競賽。均具不可避免衝突之性質。］</p>
<p>以上四者日本皆視爲制勝之點。其中尤認英美對立中國懦弱爲給予日本進行侵略之絕好機緣。是以國聯一旦略持正義日本即大肆咆哮。高倡退出國聯。開始自由用兵。大舉侵熱。</p>
<p>（二）日本退出國聯後之難關</p>
<p>彼日本帝國主義。旣已逞其暴力。不顧一切。則一旦退出國際聯盟之後，必將更加蠻横於兼併東北三省。强占榆關之外更進攻輦河擊灤東甚至爆擊平津。亦未可知然則我國將何如。世界各國將何如。而日本又將何如。　　第一，我國處此。已萬難再行忍耐雖欲勉强屈就求和而不可得。况日本旣退出國聯。則匪但有理［不可講。］且亦將無處講理。無法講理矣。今後惟有發動我廣大羣衆。作殊死戰鬭。以求民族出路。彼賭其全國國力。拼［全日本化爲焦土。以保持滿洲。］我則［奮整個民族四萬萬大衆之赤血。盡所有藴藏之富。誓死以收回東北三省。］此一戰爭。雖延至五十年一百年。亦未可知。戰爭果開始。則所謂排貨等小問題。必將自然解决。彼日本者匪特對華貿易一筆勾消。即其對歐美貿易。亦將感受莫大影響。</p>
<p>第二國際如通過勸告案。道德的裁制。即隨之成立。盟約第十六條雖未必立即實行。然中日戰爭。果眞開始者。則英美法各國爲顧全自已利益。爲保持其在中國固有市塲起見勢不能不協力對日［經濟封鎖。］未必不成爲對日手段之一。</p>
<p>第三世界經濟恐慌愈加深刻現時資本主義各國。用以克服經濟恐慌之方策其收效極數。即以日本而論。自實行停止金本位制。採用通貨膨脹政策以來。暫時的好市面。似有到來之象徴。然今年月餘以來。生絲棉紗等。皆逐漸下跌。大有重見去年夏期［不景氣］之象。設使戰端勃發。軍事費用。陡然增加。國内一般購買能力。愈見縮小海外市塲。勢且喪失。其映於世界經濟固甚嚴重。而日本帝國主義者更難悻免於崩潰。</p>
<p>第四，日本國内一般社會情勢之險惡。盡人皆知。其軍閥且故意張大。以便借用軍權以支配政治。根本推翻其所謂憲政。倘更欲盲目颟頇。獨占中國則其國力之疲弊。必將十百倍於今日。</p>
<p>吾國人際此時會。豈能甘心束手待斃。坐受宰割。東北三省現雖失陷於敵人之手。但東北確爲一猛烈之爆藥庫我國人如能誓死奮戰。絕不畏敗。敗更死戰。則最後勝利。必終歸於我國之手。</p>

<p>（南京）國聯大會定二十四日上午續開、除中日代表發言外、其餘多不發言、以示全體意見之一致、報告書草案是日可望通過、如時間不及、至遲二十五日必可通過、（二十二日中央社電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）國聯接到東北熱河後援協會北平來電後、極爲注意、惟以爲現在中日雙方並未斷絕外交關係、故中國方面欲援用盟約第十六條、尚非敵宜、（二十二日中央社電）</p>

<p>發表公報十九國委員會集議後、旋即發表公報如下、</p>
<p>國聯會秘書長遵照十九國委員會訓令、曾向各國説明照十九國委員會呈遞非常大會之報告書、應組織一種談判委員會各國對此項委員會是否有意參加、此項問題提出後、聲明願參加談判委員者、有德·意·比·英·法·西班牙·愛爾蘭·荷蘭·葡萄牙·捷克·土耳其·哥侖比亞·瓜達馬拉·匈牙利·墨西哥·挪威·巴拿馬·瑞典·瑞士·等國、波蘭復文、尚未送到、秘書長並宣言華府九國條約簽字國、有加拿大·澳州、新西蘭·南菲洲聯邦·及印度在内、此層不知各國政府是否慮及、渠認爲應使十九國委員會、注意此點、以便對此等會員國、發出請柬、邀其參加談判委員會之工作、十九國委員會、經秘書長提及之後、當認爲此種請柬、應予發出、並命秘書長照辦、十九國委員會旋對於星期五非常大會開會程序之若干點、加以研究、並對熱河時局之消息、簡略交換意見、非常大會定於星期五午前十時開會、十九國委員會則乘非常大會開會之前、於星期四日下午再行開會一次、（二十一日哈）瓦斯電）</p>

<p>（日内瓦）日本答十九特委會之文、今日發表、内分十點、（一）覆文稱報告書中關於事實之説明、多不能爲日本所承認、但對於此種事實、加以辯論、亦屬無益、（二）日本本不願見滿洲脱離中國主權、但一九三一年九月十八日以後發生之事件、國聯實負多少責任、因在爭議之初期、國聯遽躁急斥責日本、並集合西方言論以不利於日本、（三）滿洲日軍事行爲、乃中國情形所逼成之自衛計畫（四）日本確信如國聯盟約非戰公約九國公約之原則、不依時局之實際而適用之、則此問題之根本解决、不能實現、（五）［滿洲國］政府已有穩健之進步、僅熱河境内尚有組織的反對、（六）匪衆與張學良軍隊爲國聯態度所鼓勵、現集中其武力、日本爲保障［滿洲國］安全條約所束縛、不能始終沉默、（七）李頓報告書所建議及十九特委會報告書所贊成之解决原則十項、苟中國未有强有力之中央政府、什九不能履行、在滿日軍撤至南滿鐵路區域之提議、似以爲［滿洲國］之安全可以當地憲兵維持之、此説荒謬而不可行、日本仍保持其談判委員會容俄美兩國參加入反對國聯提議如欲束縳會員國與非會員國使之不承認另一國家、國聯此舉實超出其權力範圍之外、（八）十九特委會之報告書鼓勵中國拒絕和議、閃避解决、（九）日本負有維持遠東和平之責、準備與任何友邦合作、以達此目的、（十）覆文極言遠東時局之複雜、謂此種時局存在之時期尚短、故雖李頓調查團亦不能説明之、是以日本請求國聯大會再思而後决定之（二十一日路透社電）　美國不久</p>
<p>將有切實表示</p>
<p>（日内瓦）國聯領袖表示在國聯大會表决十九國委員會所擬報告書建議以前、未必能接到美國態度之正式或非正式表示、但此間認華盛頓報紙消息業已充分表示美政府對於報告認爲滿意、並有數方面覺美國務院堅持在國聯大會表决以前、不加評論一舉、即是切實表示俟國聯大會正式通過之後、美國不久亦將正式加入合作云、（二十二日國民社電）</p>

<p>應先表示其趨向於更爲廣大與基本計劃之態度、現料赫氏此種見解、定必與羅斯福意見相符合也、伍定則向未著聞於政界、但經營製造及金融事業甚衆、爲羅氏多年老友、羅在紐約州長任内、關於財政事件、必以諮之、在此次大選以前、伍氏雖爲强項之共和黨員、但據摩萊言、其財政政策、夙與羅氏及民主黨領袖相符合、伍氏年二十七即任某大製造事業之副總理、其後經營實業甚衆、并長於藝術及音樂、所著歌曲、各國爭爲奏唱、今日出任財長消息發表、民主黨政客雖多震駭、美金融界則額手相慶、認爲繼續穩固貨幣政策之保證者云、</p>

<h3>宋代院長昨接見記者談話</h3>
<p>華北財政已有圓滿解决</p>
<p>敵來卽拚其他非所計及</p>
<p>中央社云、行政院代理院長兼財政部長宋孑文氏、因鑒於華北時局嚴重、於本月十日北上、會晤華北當局洽商要公、並籌商財政辦法、旋因熱河形勢緊張、偕同張學良等前往慰勉、已於前日公里由平返滬、并於昨晨十時、在祁齊路私邸、接見各報社記者、報告此次北上經過、及今後抗日情形、茲誌其談話如次、謡諑可哂據宋氏談、當本人離滬北上前、曾迭聞各方傳來謠諑、甚謂熱河將領、與日僞當局已有諒解云云、使館方面、且以此相詰詢、該項謡傳、本不值識者一笑、且迴憶去年一二八戰爭時、日方亦迭曾揑造謡言、希圖離間、今則故技復施、迨本人抵平後、凡耳之所聞、目之所見、不待偵詢、早徴該項謡傳無稽云、</p>
<p>軍費有着本人抵平後、即與平津金融界籌商華北財政問題、已得相當結果、决定發行救國庫劵二千萬元、該項庫劵之發行、已奉中央通過、日内即可發行、至如何發行、暫緩發表、關於華北軍費之籌劃、三四五三個月、已有辦法、嗣後自當繼續籌劃、俾將士無凉餒之憂、華北將佐、對於日軍進犯均極憤慨、皆抱死拚决心、祗求腹飽、絕不他求、即軍隊開拔時、亦無任何希求、華北民衆、均眞誠熱烈、謂北人性質遲重、愛國不及南人、今可證明其言之不確、蓋北人愛國、實不後於南人也、</p>
<p>统、一團體華北各地、民衆愛國團體極多、惜無聯絡、缺乏集中力量、蓋團體多而無聯絡、則一班捐欵者每無所適從、此點須立即改革、故本人曾與平津各界名流·及上海地方協會代表黄任之·杜重遠·穆藕初·楊志雄·等、集商統一組織、已决組織［東北熱河後援協會、］各界踴躍參加集中組織、定可獲得極大有效之協助云、</p>
<p>戰地宣傳抗敵係全國當前最大事件、當使全國民衆明瞭作戰原因、而戰地之宣傳、尤爲重要、本人有鑒於此、已與平津學校當局、討論組織戰地宣傳事宜、現亦已决定組織［中央戰地宣傳隊、］分赴前方宣傳、使荷槍壯士及當地民衆、均知日軍進迫之暴行、及我方守士衛國之責任、同時使華北民衆、明瞭中央確有抗日之决心、戰地宣傳員、盡由學生担任、不分性别、以期鼓勵前方士氣、目下華北民氣、極爲振奮、實堪慶幸也、</p>
<p>惟有拚死中央及蔣委員長抗日態度、至爲堅决、外傳日本退出國聯後、勢必蠻幹到底、攻熱不得、必將分擾平津及長江沿海一帶云云、本人現未考慮此事、惟知中央及蔣委員長抱敵來即拚之决心、其他非所計及、宋氏語時、聲色惧厲、一種激昻態度、盡溢露於言外、</p>

<p>市府澈查</p>
<p>市社會局以正泰橡膠廠、因蒸　炸裂、致焚斃工人百餘名之多、特派第三科田和卿·朱圭林·李樹德·等、於昨日上午十時馳往澈查眞相、并視察該廠之安全設備、以便核辦、旋據該局第三科視察股主任田和卿談、該廠災變發生後、本局卽派員前往調查、據該廠人員述稱、肇事原因、係馬達線走電、致塗光間之戤司林引起燃燒、蒸缸間與塗光間毘連、蒸缸因室内温疲驟高、缸中空氣壓力、陡然增高、以致引起炸裂、尚屬合理、惟塗光間之戤司林、是否因馬達線走電引起燃燒、無從證實、至於工人因公死傷、應得之津貼撫恤等費、工廠法第四十五條已有詳細之規定、（一）對於因傷病暫時不能工作之工人、除担任其醫藥費外、每日給以平均工資三分二之津貼、如經過六個月、尚未痊愈、其每日津貼、得减至平均工資二分之一、但以一年爲限、（二）對於因傷病成爲殘廢之工人、永久失其全部或一部之工作能力者、給以殘廢津貼、其津貼以殘廢部分之輕重爲標準、但至多不得超過三年之平均工資、至少不得低於一年之平均工資、（三）對於死亡之工人、除給與五十元之喪葬費外、應給與其遺族撫恤費三百元、及二年之平均工資、廠方自應遵照辦理、以重人道、而符法令、本局實施工廠檢查時、對於工廠安全、原極注意、此次慘劇、尤足證明工廠安全設備之不容忽視、然該廠地處公共租界、本局因特區當局之阻梗、對於特區工廠、尚未進行檢查、今日目擊慘狀、深覺工廠檢查之重要、對於特區工廠檢查、尤有從速進行之必要、工廠發生災變、蒙其害者、不獨工人、卽廠方亦遭受重大損失、故各廠對於安全設備事項、過本局檢查員指導改善時、自當隨時遵辦、以免同樣慘案之發生、而特區工廠對於目前特區當局之阻撓檢查、未知作何感想、</p>
<p>總董憑弔</p>
<p>昨日午後、工部局總董裴爾偕工部局情報處職員賽葉、同赴災塲視察、	見許多焦爛不可辨認之屍體、由瓦礫堆中檢出爲之黯然神傷、默無一語、裴爾曾代表工部局對罹禍者表示深切之哀情、並復發表當局之意見、謂租界中之工廠法、實爲至重要之事、工部局雖不以此次之慘禍、乃因缺乏工廠法所致、但謂以僱用數百人之工廠、而鍋爐間與塗光間竟設在樓下、此實爲世界各國所無者、此種慘禍、唯有以適當之工廠法救濟之、地方當局、若　儘速厲行廠工安全條例、則工人受福匪淺、昨日之慘禍、自不致再見也、　派捕駐守</p>
<p>昨晨、塘山路大連灣路口正泰橡膠廠門首、由榆林路捕房派中西巡捕以繩圍斷禁止車輛曁行人通行、大連灣路登記處塘山路第一廠門首曁被焚之工塲由捕房派華捕駐守、禁止閒人攔入、</p>
<p>肇禍别報</p>
<p>現該工廠左近、尚未能完全恢復交通、至該廠創設之略歷、及此次肇禍之原因、除本報業有記載外、尚有足資補述者、查正泰橡膠第一製造廠係設於塘山路底一千零二十五號門牌廠屋爲二層樓、而分前後兩進、開設至今、已歷四年、最大股東爲現寓西門之江陰人劉永康（號善齋）、資本初爲十二萬、邇則增至十八萬該廠前進向爲職員辦事處、後進樓下係男工工塲樓上爲女工、專做將橡皮套鞋製盒之工作、樓下工塲内、置有油鍋四只、此次肇禍原因、據謂係傾入鍋内煎熬之油冷熱未曾調匀所致、前晨九時、一鍋先炸、轟然響後、而另一錢繼之、樓屋遭此兩巨震、隨聲坍倒、屋内電線、因卽毁壞於是起火、樓上女工、旣於屋倒而盡隨、遂多葬身火窟、欲逃無從、乃罹斯厄、又該廠左邊隔壁之江西路魯麟洋行堆棧、因被殃及幾已全部焚燬、其右邊隔壁之中和烟草公司、則受損失之程度、比較尚微、水險勢將漲價</p>
<p>保險公司初步手續</p>
<p>大美晚報云、熱河戰云密布後、本埠經營水險之保險公司、已將所有保險單内戰事危險條文、暫予取銷、據聞此舉、尚係上星期六發生、蓋響應倫敦勞合公司取銷往來及經過中日航線各水險保單内戰事危險條文一舉也、昨（二十一）日各保險公司中、前往詢問消息者、戶限爲穿、但營業清淡、而現行水險率、亦未增加、蓋聞此舉乃一種預防手段、俾一日事急時、可以臨時增加保費、據保險界某君云、沿海航線内水、險費之增加、全視時局未來之發展以爲斷、現行水險率、約爲保險金額一千六百分之一、萬一日本有阻止商輪通航情事、則倫敦水險率或將激增至百分之二或三、亦未可知、木埠水險率、大部份視倫敦以爲增减、惟若倫敦竟狂漲至百分之三或四、則本埠將察看情形、自行斟酌、查去年滬戰時、水險率、</p>
<p>曾漲至千分之五十或千分之七十五、甚致達百分之一云、</p>
<p>華盛頓誕辰</p>
<p>美僑昨日盛大慶祝</p>

<p>請願呈文竊查閘北戰區火險賠欵交涉、至今將近一年、華商發行公債、作賠償之辦法、迄未見諸實行、而洋商保險公司、依靠租界爲護符、堅執不公允之片面章程爲藉口、對於此項賠欵、毫無誠意之表示、使我一般遭災保戶、受盡飢寒之苦、終日呼籲求救、其情景早蒙鈞府所洞悉、現保戶等惟有跪求鈞府、面賜切實救濟辦法、使災區賠欵、即得解决、不勝屏營待命之至云、</p>

<p>中山文化敎育館確定</p>
<p>舉辦事業計劃大綱</p>
<p>孫科召開談話會决定</p>
<p>市府批准年助五萬元</p>
<p>中山文化敎育館、已定三月十二日、在首都總理陵園管理委員會舉行成立典禮、該館舉辦事業計劃大綱、亦已於十九日孫哲生氏在哥倫比亞路私宅召集副委員長及各組正副主任開談話會時、已將原則决定、同時前日該館開第五次籌委會時、孫氏適因另有要公、故委託葉副委員長恭綽代表、關於上海市政府補助該館事業費、業經市政會議第二百二十九次議决、每年補助五萬元已於前日批示該館知照、茲將該館確定舉辦事業計劃大綱、抄錄如下、</p>
<p>原則（一）視經費之多寡、事業之重輕、權其緩急、次第舉辦、（二）全國公私學術團體所未曾注意、或注意而不克舉辦之文化敎育事業、應先舉辦、（三）對于大多數人有利益及合於現代動向之文化敎育事業、應先舉辦、</p>
<p>甲擬辦事項（一）我國敎育之研究、（説）</p>
<p>明）我國辦理新敎育、學制數易、成效未彰、近雖厲行三民主義敎育、亦無若何之效果、今後若非澈底改革、不足以適應環境、共謀生存、本館當以三民主義爲出發點、研究一種適合於時代而又不背國情之新中國敎育、以爲再造中國之準備、（二）我國藝術史之研究、（説明）藝術與文化及民族性、關係最切、我國爲東方最古之國、而古代藝術、迄未宣揚於世界、且今後如何發揮固有、陶冶未來、以成立一種新文化、尤非有史的研究不可、（三）我國社會問題之研究、（説明）我國自遭帝國主義之侵略、一部份社會、已入資本主義狀態、而另一部份、則以歷年軍閥之起伏、尚有殘餘封建社會之存在、又以總理心理建設尚未完成、因無核心勢力、而心仰不能一致、於是青年問題、勞工問題、農民問題、常起重大糾紛、故我國社會問題、爲目前最急切之重大問題、亟待研究者也、（四）我國土地問題、（説明）土地已成近代各國共同注意之問題、我國自總理提倡平均地權以來、各方尚少詳密之研究、故推行方法、未易妥洽、且動　糾紛、反難收效、故土地問題不解决、卽不足以談民生問題、而對於匪區災區之土地善後、尤爲急待解决者、（五）總理實業計劃之研究、（説明）總理之實業計劃、實爲建設新中華之寳典、唯總理所以昭示我人者、僅爲各種原則、至其施行之方案與舉之辦步驟、仍當羅致專家、悉心計議、製成方案、以爲準則、（六）總理心理建設之研究、（説明）總理心理建設、爲挽救中國人心重大之發明、因任何民族、須有共同之歷史與共同之信仰、中國儘有五千年共同之歷史、迄未樹立四萬萬人共同之信仰、歷次革命之失敗者以此、數十年屈伏於帝國主義戀蹄之下、而不克振拔者亦以此、總理僅言心理建設之重要、至如何何建設、尚須集合專家、從科學上研究、故舉辦尤不容緩、（七）我國哲學史之研究、（説明）我國古代哲學、爲先民思想之總匯、亦卽構成文化之源泉、其所發明、恒駕西哲而上之、近來歐美學者、對於東方精神文明、推崇備至、然其所獲、不過一鱗一爪、我國今後欲成立一種新文化、非於此有深切研究、不能决定方程、故哲學史之研究、亦爲重要之業務、（八）我國地理之研究、（説）</p>
<p>明）我國前以缺乏地理智識、内政上外交上每多意外之失敗、如東北西北歷次劃界之糢糊、卽其一例、又以人文地理之不注意、經濟上亦常遭到意外之損失、故地理之重要、實不亞於歷史、（九）地方制度之研究、（説明）地方自治、爲憲政時代基礎工作、然我國幅員廣大、習俗互殊、驟行劃一之新制、必多意外困難、是則調查各地之民情風俗、博采世界各國之地方制度、以求最適宜之地方自治制度、亦爲當今切要之圖、（十）國際問題之研究、（説明）近自國際形勢轉變、現象顯著後、世界經濟日益衰落、國際政治、日益危迫、加之蘇聯以五年計劃成功、而生産加速、日帝國軍閥以佔據東三省而狂暴益甚、國際間糾紛之焦點、已集中於遠東、我國適居衝要地位、倘於國際問題、不先事分晰嘹解、一旦有事、將無應付之餘地、（十一）圖書館博物館之設立、（説）明）圖書館與博物館、本爲保存與　發文化之唯一工具、我國對於此種事業、向無大規模之設立、本館旣以提倡文化爲職志、對此二種事業、均應特别注意、並以總理革命史蹟爲中心、使民族文化、隨時代巨輪而自强不息、（十二）中山奬學金之設立、（説明）總理一生、以讀書爲救國唯一之道、本館請遵斯旨、奬勵學術、使請負者可展其天才、而有一藝之長者、得藉以深造、名曰中山奬學金、以收奬學之效、</p>
<p>乙、初步工作（一）組織實地調查團、</p>
<p>擬分組前往國内、實地考察各項情况、以爲研究與實施之根據、尤以文化敎育及民生狀况爲主要、（二）設置奬學及助學金、擬先從少數辦起、（三）特約或收購編譯撰著圖書、亦擬先從三數類辦起、（四）設置專門研究員、擬辦事項十二種、以財力人力關係、或不能多設機關、故擬先設各項研究員、分門研究、以爲初步之工作、</p>
<p>中國航空公司</p>
<p>添購水陸兩用機</p>
<p>下月中旬由美運到</p>
<p>將用於駛飛滬平線</p>
<p>中國航空公司新向美國定購之洛林式水陸兩用機、已由美起運、大約於下月中旬、可以到滬、該機將於滬平綫駛飛、因滬平綫路程較長、飛機須有充分時間之休息、始克保持旅途之安全、及機件之耐久、在普通情况之下、每機可耐用至十年、但如絕無休息及保養、則不出三四年即將損毁、至不可駛用、故添機以爲更換交添休息也、又滬平綫沿路青島等站、設備不全、機廠及職員休息所均付缺如、前次該公司主任聶開一、往全線視察時、亦注意及此、現該公司爲全綫營業逐漸發展計、故一切設備、如機廠及休息室等、均在趕建中、至前傳將添闢三機塲、或係上項消息之誤傳云、</p>
<p>市府本年度預算</p>

<p>出路在那裏？</p>
<p>丨丨武進黄汝成君來信丨丨</p>
<p>編者先生：鄙人有一個很嚴重的疑難，要請先生費神解答。詳情如下：譬如一個人在萬不得已的環境下，要想棄掉一個不願亦不必久住的家庭，向外面遠走。然而這一個人年幼識少，離開了家要想尋一個棲身之所，竟至徬徨歧途，莫知所從。這一個人雖有書算的種種本領，却苦於没有相當的人家要他。這一個人又有一個强健的身軀，要想去當兵！！！最好是去當殺外來的敵人的義勇軍！！去效命疆塲，又苦於没有一個路子去達到這個目的。這一個人又有很多的力氣，要想去當工人，也苦於没有一個路子去達到這個目的。卽使工作的路子有了：人家一定因你從來没有做過這件工作，不要你這生手。那這個人除了求乞和自殺以外，還有什麽路子走呢？編者先生，鄙人現在將要等於這一個人了。我這個家庭，無論如何一定要離去。然而出路呢？我費了幾天功夫：絞腦子，挖心血，想盡這一個疑難問題，都不能解决。我是久讀貴報的，深知貴報貴欄是社會人羣前進的導師。所以不由得將這個嚴重的疑難來請求解决！懇請先生不要問爲什麽要棄掉這個家庭的緣由，也不要問有什麽一個萬不得已得環境；只要對於離開了家庭有没有一個生存的地方丨丨解决衣食住的地方丨丨就是：［當書算工作的路子丨丨要供給膳宿的丨丨有没有？當兵的路子丨丨要供給膳宿的丨丨有没有？當工人的路子丨丨要供給膳宿的丨丨有没有？·····其他的路子有没有？］的一個問題：作一個切實的答覆，以解决我這個很嚴重的疑難問題。</p>
<p>答：來書文字均清晰有力，足見　足下是個勤奮有志的青年。你所問的，我們先簡單的答覆一句：書算工作的路子也有：當兵的路子也有：當工人的路子也有，其牠的各種路子也儘有。可是一椿：路子雖然儘有，却不是你一到外邊，便可一脚踏上；第一，你要有冒險的精神，大着膽兒，先離開那個牢籠丨丨家庭丨丨再説；第二，又要具有百折不撓的堅决的志趣，不然的話，稍微受點挫折，便爾怨天尤人，唉聲歡氣，或是抵不過環境的壓迫，頓萌消極自殺念頭。自已覺得没有這種志氣，那就不要輕於一試。本欄記者只能就社會的情狀與理論的根據聊貢所見，可惜，我們這兒不是職業介紹所，也不是招兵買馬的大本營，更不是收納雇傭工人的工廠，眞正的［切實答覆］那可就難了。</p>
<h3>運米船商成立各帮聯合委員會</h3>

<p>組聯合會運米客商、自宣言罷運後、爲集中力量、一致反對斛司重斛實行平斛漏斗起見、特於昨日下午四時、開各帮聯席會議、到南角·青角·北石浦·西塘·崇古·張堰·崑山·無錫·常熟·楓涇·平望·盛澤·同里·等四十餘帮代表吳福海·章福生·丁根和·戴根寳·金渭祥·夏天海·瞿金生·金根大·李根祥·等六十餘人、公推陳智强主席、當卽成立各帮運米客商聯合委員會、並推定陳智强·瞿金生·任進泉·吳福海·夏天福·章福生·戴根寳·金阿大·王阿三·張六壽·曾阿富·鈕桂福·張阿秋·丁根和·金渭祥·呂俊文·沈小五·姚增大·等十九人爲委員、卽日宣告成立、</p>
<p>電實業部該會成立後、卽電實業部云、南京實業部陳部長鈞鑒、竊查米行斛司、以重斛舞弊剥削運米船戶、歷年遭受痛苦、實難言狀、曾於去年聯名呈請滬市黨部·社會局·要求嚴予制止、然迄今猶無相當辦法、運米船戶、處此行家與斛司重重壓迫之下、欲圖生存、勢不可得、我爲魚肉、彼爲刀俎、任其宰割、故船戶等忍無可忍、不得不出此罷運之一途、以作最後之爭、而求正理之批評、務必廢止重斛、實施平斛漏斗目的而後已、茲屬會除呈請本市黨政機關辦理外、爲特電懇鈞部、迅予取締以蘇民困、而杜流弊、不勝迫切翹企之至、各帮運米客商聯合委員會叩、養、</p>

<h3>國貨論壇國貨運動中的農村問題</h3>
<p>— 潘仰葊</p>
<p>國貨的原料從那裏來？</p>
<p>廣大的國貨銷塲在那裏？</p>
<p>在這國貨運動中，我們不能不注意到這兩項問題，而唯一的答案，因爲中國有三分之二的土地是農村，百分之八十五的人民是農民，所以，以工商作主體的國貨運動，却也不能忽略了農村和農民呢！</p>
<p>但是我們回顧目前我國的農村，因爲天災人禍，匪亂疾疫重重的摧殘，從歷刧頻仍的西北，以迄號稱天堂的江南，那裏不是瘡痍滿目！豫陜百里無人烟，農村的組織已被全部摧殘，要從這些地方産生國貨原料怎麽可能，以至棉麥都得大批的向外國去買。如果再要向這些被踐壞的農村中去推銷國貨，江蘇浙江距離上海不遠的地方，有購買力的農民已經漸漸的減少，皖贛湘鄂已成爲鳳毛麟角。所以，在這次國貨運動中，適逢農村衰敗陷於極度的今日，我們爲著原料和廣大的銷塲，不能不注意到農村問題，農村經濟復興問題。</p>
<p>因爲用外國原料製造的國貨，（除去没有代用品的化學用品）并不是我們所需要的國貨：更因爲如果没有可以推銷的農村，生産過乘且會臨到這萌茅期的國貨生産界。這實在已經形成了嚴重的局面，固然使我們國貨生産界不能不注意，而且使我們不得不爲著自已爲著他人而同謀補救！</p>
<p>最近張公權先生曾説過：［扶助農村的問題比扶助工商業的問題，在今日更爲急切！一近今金融界關於農村問題的注意，於此可見一斑。可是我們國貨工商界，對於這原料的來源，商品的銷路，任其自然的從衰敗而消滅麽？</p>
<p>討論</p>
<h3>國貨年首應注意的一　個切要問題</h3>
<p>— 陳達棠</p>
<p>提倡國貨非徒喊口號而已足，須以自已之貨物替代外來之商品，始克有濟，此固盡人知之。自已之貨物，農産品來自本國之田間，製造品來自本國之工廠，亦無庸詳論。顧我國工業幼穉生産落後工廠尚未遍設於各地，有之僅限於三五通商口岸，此三五通商口岸，尤以上海爲最，於是上海以一地而爲民族工業之中心點，其盛衰榮枯動輒涉及全國經濟之活動。是故吾以爲當今國貨年開始之時第一所應注意者非爲多開國貨展覽會，亦非由報紙多出國貨特刋若干次，更非聘請幾多名人演講等事，却爲一二八以後上海國貨工廠之存亡問題。</p>
<p>溯上海國貨工廠，在歐戰期間，因一時之機遇，曾得一度之繁榮。迨戰後則日漸衰頽，二三年來，外受世界經濟恐慌之襲擊，内遭天災人禍之動亂，於是不僅無進，且益增退敗。若絲廠全市有一百十餘家，民國二十年年底，祗能數家開工，此爲最明顯者，及夫去年一二八事起戰區適在我國貨工廠集中地之閘北吳淞江灣等處，因是砲擊火毁，凡在戰區内者，幾無一幸存，據田和卿氏於去年十二月三十一日向時事新報發表談話云；閘北長安路一帶，工廠除遭流彈外，尚無其他損失。例如寳山路。横浜路·永興路·中華路·天通庵路，以及江灣吳淞等處之工廠，幾全部破産，總計在四百餘家以上。内中以商務印書館一家，損失即有五千萬元，閘北水電公司亦在一千萬元左右，其餘之棉布廠，紗廠等部，損失至少至二萬萬元以上，此四百餘家之工廠，自戰事結束後，數月以來，雖有數家尚思力圖整頓，惟以元氣太傷，甚難重整。故戰後之復業者寥寥無幾。君人讀此能不驚心。然此猶僅就戰區内而言，他若戰區外所受之營業停頓，間接虧蝕，其損失亦詎能以數計？如有精確之統計調查，恐所有本國工業之精華已斵喪盡矣。謂予不信請再檢視各業，如紗業於民國二十年上半年停錠數不過四九○·一五五。去年上半年則增至二、三三八五三六○。絲廠至十月中猶僅有四十五家復工，而至十一月底則又全國只餘二家之雙宮絲廠福倫鴻倫且宣告停業。烟草業由六十四家而減爲六十家。其餘在國貨工業中較小者，如牙刷工塲，火柴工塲，肥皂工塲，製帽工塲，琺瑯工塲，化装業工塲，調味料工業，橡皮工業等，據中行月刋五卷四期所載，或營業不振，或金融阻滯，或擬縮小範圍，或準備結束，凡此種種均明示國貨工業之没落，夫提倡國貨首須有國貨之供給，乃供給國貨之各工廠，於滬戰後一敗至此，若不救濟則提倡國貨將以何物供國人之需求乎？故吾於國貨年開始之時特提出［一二八以後，上海國貨工廠之存亡一一問題以正告我提倡國貨諸君曰，上海國貨工廠之復興爲提倡國貨之先决條件，願共同向此路以謀發展。一月三日作於國立上海商學院</p>

<h3>國産水坭之介紹</h3>
<p>— 禾口</p>
<p>水坭一物，爲現在建築上最重要而最普遍之材料，近更發明鋼骨混凝土，堅固異常，故水坭之用途日辟益廣，歐美各國及日本，對於水坭之製造，已有悠久之歷史，我國因科學不發達，工商業不振興，至清光緒二十七年始行發軔，幸創辦者刻苦經營，後繼者絡續倡行，至今出品優良，成績斐然，國内建築上所用水坭，已大半取諸國内，殊爲好現象也，茲特將國人自辦之水坭廠及其出品介紹於下：</p>
<p>（一）啓新洋灰公司丨創辦於光緒二十七年，爲我國自辦水坭廠之鼻祖，廠址在河北省之唐山，交通便利，資本四百萬兩，此年産量一百三十萬桶，（每桶）三百七十五磅）商標爲馬牌，運銷中國北部，上海，福州，香港及南洋羣島等處，爲今日中國最發達之水坭廠。</p>
<p>（二）華記湖北水坭公司丨成立於宣統二年，開工四年，虧耗甚多，遂歸併於啓新公司，廠址在湖北　冶，每年産量五十五萬桶，商標爲塔牌，運銷中國中部，九江，安慶，及上海等處，資本一百萬兩。</p>
<p>（三）中國水坭公司丨組織於民國十年，十三年開工，資本初一萬元，現今規模甚大，有乾濕廠各一，廠址在江蘇龍潭鎭，運輸極便，每年産額爲七十五萬桶，佔中國水泥製造業之第二位，商標爲泰山牌，運銷長江一帶，及上海廣州等處。</p>
<p>（四）廣州水坭廠丨在廣東省城東，珠江南岸，成立於光緒三十四年，本爲清政府所設立，民元後改隸廣東省政府，現並有新廠之添設，規模漸大，每年合産五十五萬桶，商標爲五羊牌，運銷中國南部。</p>
<p>（五）。海水坭公司丨在上海龍華，水路有浦江，陸上有滬杭鐵路交通極便，成立於民國七年，資本二百萬元，商標爲象，每年産量五十萬；運銷我國東部諸省，除啓新及中國，二公司之外首推該廠。</p>
<p>（六）濟南水坭公司丨位於山東省濟南，規模甚小，資本僅二十萬元，每年約産十萬桶，僅足供本地及附近數縣之用　（七）太湖水坭公司丨籌辦於民國十年，廠址位於無錫，資本一百五十萬元，每年能産四十萬桶，詳情未明。</p>
<p>以上七家，皆爲國人自辦之公司，每年全國共産四百十五萬桶，他若青島之山東水坭公司，香港之九龍水坭公司，澳門之青州洋灰公司，安南之海防洋灰公司，其廠址雖在我國境内，但非我國人所自辦，故不與焉。</p>
<p>訪問記</p>
<h3>華生電器廠與葉友才君（上）</h3>
<p>— 洽成</p>
<p>在落後的中國·居然有經營製造電器事業的，而且能自製發電機與電扇，這消息或許足使我們興奮吧！中國人的聰明智力本不後於人，華生電器廠與葉友才先生能獲得成功，并非是徼倖，惟有十五年來奮鬥的毅力和精神而已。</p>
<p>天然先生上期曾説過由洋布店學徒而發明電風扇的楊濟川先生，他是華生創辦人之一。當他和葉友才先生製了兩架從理想到現實的電扇以後，他們因爲當時國内電器完全是外國貨，而葉先生當時在首先經售電氣的威靈洋行服務，感，觸更多，所以和袁宗耀先生創設華生廠，在北四川路横浜橋，於民國五年一月，奠定基礎。最初的華生廠，只是賃屋數間，僱用工人六七人，因爲成本和人才的關係，僅能造製電氣限制表，電氣電流表，電氣電壓表：而創辦華生　葉楊袁三位先生，大家都躬自操作，但是現今被稱爲中國首創電器製造業的工廠，却在此小規模的組織中試騐規劃而成　華生廠製造電表以前，市上完全是外國貨，定價都在十兩以上；華生開幕後，抱價廉物美的主張，每具定價祗有五兩，所以銷路很好，而半年後工廠即逐漸擴充，已由六七個工人到四五十人了。但是，在商業競爭中，外國人的傾銷政策是很毒辣的，因爲華生電表的暢銷，外貨乃亦不惜低價來競爭，以至電表賣到成本以下的二兩。這的確中了外國商人的壓迫中國新興工業的毒計，在火併的商戰中，萌芽期的華生因爲成本關係，感到若干的困頓；可是，這就得佩服葉先生的毅力和精神，他們不獨因外貨壓迫而被軋出，反若開始製造發電機和變電器。</p>
<p>這是中國自製發電器的開始；因爲華生本著價廉物美的一貫政策，當時外貨售價二千兩的機器，華生的只要一千兩，外貨認爲可以獨佔的市場，至此又受一打擊。外國電器商自然是一貫的抵抗，一再的减價拚殺，二千兩的機器竟賣到六百兩；這是華生和外貨血戰的第二次。</p>
<p>電扇雖是華生廠的組織動機，而且葉友才先生和榻清川先生每年都在繼續的探討改製，可是迄至民國十二年試騐成功以後，才用以問世。華生電扇出世以後，當年即銷出一千具，後來因爲自已的出品保證了信譽，去年所銷的竟達二萬五千具以上；定價只有外貨四分之一，而且能久開不壞，所以華生電扇在國内市塲上，已全部克服了外國，按照貿易額比較，已達九與一之比了。這固然是華生的成功，葉友才先生的成功，但在此國貨處處被外貨壓迫的時候，華生能代國貨生産界揚眉吐氣，實在是值得稱道的。而且從華生發展史上，已給予我們一個敎訓，用奮鬥的毅力和精神，總有獲得成功的可能啊！</p>
<h3>國貨新訊婦女界的國貨運動</h3>
<p>— 洽成</p>
<p>自從仰　先生在本刋迭次呐喊後，上海婦女界先覺即興起而努力於國貨運動，當我驅車往參加家庭日新會家事改進會所主持的家庭聯誼會時，雖因爲初次投身社會交際而感到畏怯，但仍舊很興奮的去觀光國貨年婦女方面的運動。</p>
<p>到達的時候是第一個人，坐在屋角看朱王浣青女親自佈置會塲，走的時候又是最後一個人，站在門旁看一羣一羣的參加者離開會塲，所以，這以家庭爲單位的聯誼會，一幕一幕的映入這孤獨者的腦際。</p>
<p>如果要描寫會塲的話，尚賢堂的會客室中坐滿了一對一對的夫婦以及他們的結晶，長　上放着一盆一盆的糖果，壁上掛着大衣和禮帽，爐中的火融和了室内個個人的心，没有什麽辯爭，只有笑聲，太太們和先生們和就着她們的朋友在閒談，　朋友們更含着糖果在開心。</p>
<p>講演的人不肯放棄了他們的立塲，劉王立明講的是節制生育，王志莘講的是家庭經濟，從詼諧的語調中叙述重要的問題。大家吃過了茶點以後，談到國貨和節儉的主要問題，大家决定了公約四項：</p>
<p>（一）凡入本會之家庭關於衣服飲食等日用品，一概採用國貨。　（二）凡入本會之家庭，宴客時肴饌碗碟，須用國貨，每席所費至多十元。　（三）凡入本會之家庭，時節餽贈，慶賀弔奠，以及小兒壓歲錢等，概從省儉　，贈送時最好採用國貨公司禮劵，其數目以致送一元爲度。　（四）凡入本會之家庭，均須確立預算决算，　各就所需用品先行查明，嚴格　審核，如發現仍有非國貨時，應設法另覓國貨替代。</p>
<p>自後，由會中印好這公約全文，分發給各個家庭的人們，用書諸紳的督促方法，第一步建樹若干典範的國貨家庭。　這也許是是星的微光，但是光明的開始；有了許多熱心的主婦和仕女們的力行，這熱烈的聯誼會自然有發揚光大的希望。所以，在微雨中，我彳亍於街頭，踏上歸途時，仍舊抱着熱烈的希望。</p>
<h3>國貨店員起碼條件</h3>
<p>— 靄吳</p>
<p>一、對顧客不論生意大小、貴富　老小，男女妍醜，都要視同衣食父母，殷勤招待。卽使貨價不合顧客的意思，生意不能成交，也不露厭惡的辯色。希望他下次再來。</p>
<p>二，舉止要活潑而大方，不油滑，　不呆鈍，使得顧客没有不快之感。</p>
<p>三、遇到粗魯的顧客，仍能用謙和方法，來感動他，絕不和他計較。</p>
<p>四、對於各種貨物，原料製造優點等等，都很熟悉，能隨　隨地作切實扼要而有效力的宣傳。</p>
<p>要達到上述四個起碼條件，自然要從訓練入手。那末店員補習敎育，是再急要没有的了。奉勸國貨商店的經理先生們，眼光要放得遠些，店員知能道德的增進，直接影響於服務效率，目前爲了店員補習敎育，用去少許的費用，將來業務方面獲得利益很大呢。</p>

<p>在横的方面：（一）工廠要改善，用科學管理方法，使生産合理化，這是全世界先進各國所公認對工廠設施最好的方法，非惟生産能夠因而增進，出品能夠因而精良，即成本也可以因而減輕，蘇俄由農業國家，急速地改變成工業國家·他們在工廠中也採用這生産合理化的方法，提早无成他們的五年計劃。（二）捐除同業嫉視，進行同業聯合，在今日帝國主義者政治與經濟極度高壓的時候，全國上下宜團結一致，對外才有力量，尤其同業有休戚關係，更要和衷共濟，並且非但應當捐除同業嫉視，更其要進一步，每一工業須組織一合作社，處理這種工業對外對内的一切事宜，如聯合進貨，可使成本減輕，聯合銷貨，可使貨價平衡，聯合組織研究會，根據各工廠情形共同研討設備改善，貨品改良，在原料方面儘量採用國産，而最要緊的，就是要深刻的注意到社會情形，對於自身的處置是否適合？</p>
<p>在此還有必須特别注意的一點：中國農民，佔全國人口百分之八十以上，那麽國貨的銷路，當然要靠着農民，但自帝國主義者經濟伸入農村，我農村經濟已宣告破産了。加之大災入禍接踵　息，如去年水患，全國被災區域共十六省區，被災人口達五千萬人以上，雖如素稱富庶的東南幾省，於本年五六月中，在江蘇最繁榮號稱工業區的無錫，迭次發生搶米風潮，又如前二三月間江蘇揚中縣農民集合擁入縣政府抗捐，顯呈出農村經濟恐慌的尖鋭化。但在另一方面如雲南貴州四川新疆等省，因爲交通不便，食糧和原料每年有大批的焚毁，而東南數省每年鬧着糧荒，年年由外國購進大批的糧食和原料，進口的數字每年有很大的增加，如前年丨一九三一年米的進口數爲六三·八零五·九三一海關兩，爲歷年來米進口最高的數目。去年東南數省雖幸獲豐收，但米價暴跌，計一畝田所産的值價，尚抵不到所耗的肥料，而政府在這個時候還向外國大購食糧，在這種畸形的狀態之下，他們。腹都不能顧全，怎樣能夠顧到消費者是外貨是國貨？當然惟便宜是圖。去年雷厲風行抵制日貨，而日貨進口數，據日本大藏省發表，仍有二五八·零四六·零零零日金，以當時匯兑計算·約值國幣五萬萬元以上。在破碎農村所剩餘下的一些金錢，也都移入都市了；然而都市呢？都市也是恐慌，即以全國金融總會集的上海而言，在商業最繁盛的南京路上，血紅而斗大的［大廉價］［大拍賣］［大犧牲］一幌幌的大幡，一年到頭飄映在我們底眼簾，都市經濟恐慌的病象不是已十足的顯示在我們的面前嗎？所以我們如果眞的想國貨走上生路，尤應根本了解從片面着手决不能夠達到目的的，要從多方面來着手的。即要使國貨暢銷，必定要增高人民的購買力，要增高農民的購買力，必須救濟農村。根據此理論，所以無論是生産日本家和金融資本家，應當聯合起來，一方對於農村經濟的援助，組織農村消費合作社，以减少商人從中剥削的負担。一方對於停滯在農村中的原料和食糧運出：并且要負起改良農村，提高農民敎育，灌輸　們一切農作科學方法的責任，要知道直接援助農村，間接即援助自已。這才是國貨的眞出路，才是中國民族工業的眞出路，也才是中華民族的眞出路。</p>

<h3>可憐這五萬萬兩漏巵</h3>
<p>— 洽成</p>
<p>來路貨支配了上海多少男女，以致一般意志薄弱的店員不惜覥顏訴説來路貨的好處，這是多麽的可恥呵丨九一八事變以後，曾有人大聲疾呼的説，服用敵貨等於服用炸彈，但是來路貨這名辭仍舊没有離開上海人的嘴邊</p>
<p>一二八的飛機大砲，躉批大宗的來路貨來臨上海，江灣閘北吳淞滿目瘡痍的殘跡，都是來路貨的味道；這辛酸莫明的奇味，自然只是來路貨的特長，上海人也許嘗試夠了嗎？有人感嘆滬戰損失之鉅大，其實在海關貿易報告上，這時時掛在摩登士女，漂亮店員口角上的來路貨，每年早已從我們瀕於血枯的國家經濟中抽去五萬萬兩呢；這殺人不見血的手段，有誰來注意呵丨</p>
<p>請君嘗試來路貨，這一二八的血痕火花，這山海關的砲聲，這每年五萬萬兩的漏巵！</p>
<p>國貨聲中之現象江中　·</p>
<p>我們歙　·　是在萬山之中，文化却也不甚落後，我本是個小學生，無在本刋發表意鳳的資　；但至此也不得不説兩句：</p>
<p>［提倡國貨］［打倒日貨］［····］［···］</p>
<p>大都是從一般公務人員的口中所説，手中所寫出的，尤其是他們（指公務人員）吃的是日貨，穿的是日貨：單説他們召開紀念會的時候，偏要用東洋紙來冩標語，印宣言吸外國香烟，穿外國西装，····</p>
<p>只要他們的夫人小姐一開口·再是什麽仇貨，也要想法辯來的，唉可憐，可歎。</p>
<h3>國貨介紹所與産銷合作</h3>
<p>— 周成勛</p>
<p>從産銷合作協會連帶産生了國貨介紹所，幾個月來進行的經過，雖然還没有呈露出顯著的成績，但從牠本身的組織上，意義上，步驟上加以推測，離［産銷合作］眞正的效能，一定不遠。</p>
<p>爲了相傳下來客帮辦貨的不切實，爲了工廠們没有普設發行機關的可能，國貨介紹所就秉承［産銷合作］的主義開始成立，我們要解釋牠所負的使命和期望牠的成功起見，下面幾點原則，值得加以注意（一）收分工合作的效益各埠有了　國貨介紹所，工廠們可以把運　用在營業推廣上的心力，卸下　一部份來讓國貨介紹所去負，　自已儘在工作上謀改革進步，　這比工廠本身遍立發行所的增　費人事，豈非來得省便簡捷。（二）隨時交換商情市况上面説過　，工廠們要處處設發行機關是　不可能的，那末憑各申莊客人　嘴裏或是添貨信上要曉得各地　銷售的趨勢和消費者的動變，直是難乎其難，國貨介紹所羅　致有思想的人才，組織健全的　系統，與工廠們完全取合作的步伐，於是可以常常融通消息　，報告情形，工廠方面就有了　捨取的方針。</p>
<p>（三）有意識的廣告宣傳普遍各地　的商號，大都是爲了博利才營　業並不是爲了要發展國貨才經　營國貨，所以國貨的能夠予内　地民衆的認識，着實淺薄，國　貨介紹所肩起這個重任，盡力　把國貨影象實地的注射到民衆　腦袋裏，用有思想的方法，洗　革去舊式商號固有的陋習。（四）免除一切呆帳損失現在的商　塲，往往聽到某帮某號閉歇某　帮某號倒欠的惡消息，使一切　工廠們視放客帮帳爲畏途，　雖然，在商號方面，其中果　有許多人力不能挽回的原因，　但是營業方針的的不合理化，　與乎没有精細審察的目光，也　足以促成此種現象而有餘，商　號本身旣蒙損失，工廠也受到　呆帳的牽累，國貨介紹所與普　通商號的立塲根本不同，牠和　工廠們有密切的連鎖關係，用　相機應變的手腕，具妥穩精確　的辦法，避免呆帳的侵襲，並　不像普通商號的唯利是問，濫　放客帳可比，工廠旣多一重保　障，各地市塲，也受到間接的　穩定。</p>
<p>當然，還有許多關於國貨介紹　所的能夠促進［産銷合作］的原則，　在下没有想到，但從在下服務的一　家國貨工廠和國貨介紹所幾個月合　作的事實上看來，覺得上面數點，　已夠受到效能的了，</p>
<p>國貨介紹所在各地成立的，眼　前是很少，我們希望不久的將來·　到處可以望見高樹着的國貨介紹所　子，</p>

<h3>廣州市之展覽會</h3>
<p>廣州市近爲發展市政的設施，和促進實業的改良起見，於本年二月十五日起舉行廣州市展覽會，名譽會長爲林雲陔，會長爲劉紀文，是會於國貨之徴集，尤爲注意，滬上各工廠均已接到其徴品函件，聞上海各著名國貨工廠，如中國化學工業社，華生電器廠，中華琺瑯廠，五和織造廠等，均已分别，派員赴粤陳列，茲擴錄宣言之一節如下：　廣州地濱江海，支流四貫，鐵道分行，農工産品旣豐，水陸交通更便，故對國内商業貿易，則粤貨流通於各省市塲，對世界經濟接觸，則本市更爲全國先導，證諸本市之經濟歷史，則葡萄牙之通航於澳門也，實始於明嘉靖三十六年，而廣州市［行商］之設也，又已肇於拒毒戰爭未啓之前矣，此綿遠之歷史，蓋由經濟地理之優越，有以造成之。就本市經濟地位言，以全國一百零六商埠，而歸納於四十九海關，每年出入口貨總税收之比較，代表廣州之粤海關，常居全四之第二三位。其所以致此者，蓋除本省東，西，北三江及南路各商市，與沿海，沿長江各省有直接貿易外，在國際間有特殊之經濟接觸者，密邇則如香港，澳門，稍遠則爲美屬之菲律濱，英屬之澳大利，及法，暹，英，荷四屬之南洋羣島，與日本台灣高麗，（其他）非直接通航者，猶不在列）是本市旣有此優美之經濟環境，則特殊地位之造成，豈偶然哉。若夫省内各地之物産，如順德之絲從化之油，鶴山之烟，曲江之　，樂昌之煤，北海之藍靛，石灣之陶瓷，東莞之草蓆，蔗糖，潮州之陶器茶葉，惠陽，寳安，東莞，樂昌，連縣之鵭，東西北江之鉍，錳，其産量之豐，爲數有足驚人者，故謂吾粤有天然之寳庫，信不誣也。</p>
<p>夫我粤旣具此豐厚之物産，本市復據有優越之地位，則對外貿易之盛，宣可預期，顧民元以來，本市國際貿易，入超之數，恒達四五千萬元此中原因，雖或爲歐美産業革命所影響，與夫資本主義所侵凌，然興辦實業者，毅力不足，策劃不周，亦其致敗之由也，夫處商戰之世，戰鬥員爲工爲商，戰鬥器具爲機械，爲各種貨物，立國於世界上，能精新此等戰鬥員，修明此戰鬥器者，即可適存；否則其國家鮮不被淘汰。吾人懔於斯義，故欲舉農具，畜牧，種植，蠶絲，田料，農産，染織，化學，飲食，機械，電器，手工，醫藥，工料等類農工商品，無論其爲市産，爲國産，均薈萃於一堂，以視何者爲良，何者爲寙？何者當改善？何者當求精？何者應歸國家經營？何者應由人民舉辦？務使斯會成實業常識之寳庫，足供作業者之實騐研究，庶藉觀摩之效，俾達進展之效，俾達進展之期，斯亦本會之意也。　總理有言：［開發財富，莫如振興實業］又言；［廣州不僅爲中國南部之商業中心，亦爲通中國最大之都市，迄於近世，廣州實爲太平洋最大都市也，亞洲之商業中心也］。吾人缅懷斯義，爰組設廣州市展覽會籌備會，搜羅品物，以備薦陳，務於明年二月十五日，開會於粤秀山間，俾樹革命建設之規模，求百貨改良之標的，斯本之繁榮，實業之興發，革命之促進，可翹足而待已，尚望熱忱國人實業鉅子，寄我物品，示我周行，使政有所資，事有所鑑，物無棄材，地無秘實，豈獨本市之榮，亦中國之利也。</p>
<p>編餘</p>
<p>提倡土貨中國今日提倡國貨，處處覺得捉襟見肘，有不能自給的樣子。所以名爲提倡國貨，有時尚不免推銷了洋貨。因此有人主張［與其提倡國貨，不如提倡土貨。］劉椀公君來信希望本刋特闢一欄專來介紹［土貨］這個意思，編者很是贊同，希望讀者們多多賜敎。</p>
<p>國貨氣球橡皮汽球，向係仇貸，計有兩種，一種装有吹口者，俗呼洋泡泡，一種注入輕氣，下端擊綫，能上升空中，即是輕氣球，均爲新年中兒童的恩物。查海關册每年進口，要達十二萬元。這次中國國貨公司開幕的贈品，倒是國貨，爲四川路金星工藝廠所自製。不過大家要小心，球上印有［大中國福昌］出品的，聽説屬於劣貨。</p>
<p>土布有慮前　載了一售善着　言的食紹變　土布以後，讀者部東問詾，有位朱實生看，住在巨贛　路大典里十號，特婉來信，要求本刋介紹善言和他談談。據朱君説他有一極大效力的推銷土布辦法。這是很好的消息。我想不介黄君樂與朱君接洽，凡是經營土布事業的也願和他聯絡起來。</p>
<p>追想項先生國貨界元動五洲大藥房經理項松茂先生，遇難已逾一年了，凡是景仰項先生的，都是痴心虚想，希望項先生脱險歸來，爲我國貨界共同效力。可是消息依舊寂然，眞堪太息，昨在其哲嗣繩武君案頭，獲覩項先生在遇難前，有自勉一聯，極慷慨曠達之致，不期成爲懺語，爲之擲筆三歎。聯云：　平居宜寡慾養生，臨大節則達生委命。</p>
<p>治家須量入爲出，殉大義則芥視千金。</p>

<h3>紫羅蘭𥂝談薈</h3>
<p>— 瘦鵑</p>
<p>二月十九日的夜半，我從蘇州回到上海，在廉織細雨中趕往辣斐德路寓所去，精神是疲倦極了。下車的當兒，偶一疎忽，竟掉了一箇十年來息相依的黑皮小錢夾。第二天早上一夢醒回，方始發覺了這回事，一時驚惶失措，不知所可，因爲内中除了我自已一顆常用的水晶章外，還有一二件别人家所托付與我的重要的東西，要是丢了，如何對得起人？并且又有蘇友朱青雲君的一篇文稿，很鄭重的親自交給我，要我在本欄中刋布的，這是他的心血的結晶，丢了也很過意不去。當下無可如何，便跑去看我的老同學鄭耀南兄，擬了箇廣告託他代登，一面聲明遺失，一面作珠還合浦的萬一之望。誰知廣告刋布之日，一早就得了一封天外飛來的喜信，具名［方耕山］三字，據説那錢夾恰被他拾得，因生平以道德爲懷，亟欲物歸原主，約我立刻到紗布交易所大厦的大方貿易公司，和他會面。我驚喜之餘，卽忙跑去看他，走進門去，見一位四十餘歲的藹然可親的長者，穿着一身挺挺的西装，迎上來和我握手，原來就是那位［以道德爲懷］的方耕山先生。寒喧了一會，方知他是寗波人，向在缅甸商，回國後就創立這大方貿易公司，經營駝毛，平生茹素信佛，敦品立行，鑒於叔季之世，人心不古，很願提倡社會道德，那夜他在親戚家應酬回來，路過辣斐德路，回到他薩坡賽路的寓所去，無意中卻拾得了這小小錢夾，回寓後打開一看，發見我的名片，因就寫信給我，當下便從銀箱中取出錢夾，一一點交與我，絲毫無誤，并拒絕一切酬報，但願和我做一箇永久的朋友。那時我感動已極，只得掬誠道謝，方先生一直送我到大門口，方始握手道德家，眞是難能可貴，因此急急的記了下來，以風當世。</p>
<h3>頑妻劣子</h3>
<p>— 百合</p>
<p>丨如何治法丨</p>
<p>不長進的兒子，整天到晚，混在外面打架，偷東西。被害人被他纒擾不清，結結實實的用老拳敎訓他一頓吧，倒似乎有些犯不上·而且在他的老子娘面上，也似乎没有交代。但老是這樣下去，終究也不是辦法。於是不得不去找到他的老子娘，老子娘没法可想，惟有登報驅逐劣子，脱離父子關係，隨他去餓死也好，被人打死也好，被人送進公安局去法辦也好。</p>
<p>潑悍的婦人，在外面幹不名譽的事，給丈夫知道了，當然要把伊斥責一番，或是禁止伊的自由一下。但越是潑悍的婦人，却越會做作。往往丈夫陪着一副笑臉向伊規勸，伊倒拍檯拍凳的哭着吵着喊寃枉。若是丈夫心腸一硬，不去睬伊，伊還會直挺挺的躺在牀上絕食。若是這一種妙計，還是嚇不倒丈夫，那麽，不客氣，解下袴帶，牀梗上一掛，哭哭啼啼的装成一副上吊的樣子。到此地步，做丈夫的怕弄假成眞，十九是自會讓步，自認不是的。</p>
<p>國聯的處理東北案，中國是儘踱着方步，斯文一脈，按步就班。雖然吃盡了虧，始終没有鐵青着臉，同對手方揎拳勒臂過，祗把對手方視作人家的頑劣兒子，潑悍婦人，而向處於父兄或丈夫地位的國聯交涉。對手方果然潑悍，左不依，右不從，眼涙鼻涕，儘着撒嬌。現在要預備退出國聯，據説，這是伊的第三條妙計。</p>
<p>到此地步，一切扭扭揑揑的做作，告一段落，已到了最後一分鐘。但不知國聯預備輕憐密愛的自已讓步呢，還是大刀闊斧的驅逐劣子？日子逐漸近了，大家儘着瞧罷。</p>
<h3>薄情男女之當頭棒</h3>
<p>— 仁</p>
<p>人是有一個關鍵，這個關鍵，可以使人的心</p>
<p>大爲改變，那就是當一個人得意了的時候，以前的恩義情愛可以忘掉，就是以後的生活也將不加思索。</p>
<p>尤其是情塲中，更可證實上面的話的確鑿。他和伊初是如膠如漆。一旦他或伊的地位增高，便容易忘却對方，棄舊戀新，造成了［但見新人笑，那聞舊人哭］的凄慘情景。</p>
<p>好多的青年，往往爲了喪失對方，把固有的志氣，消滅殆盡，甚或殺身離世，以避此煩惱的紅塵，説來傷心！</p>
<p>聞最近明星影片公司新出有聲鉅片［失戀］，即採取此意爲劇旨，由前電影皇后張織雲主演，更覺演來異常悲感，我以爲此片確是世間薄情男女之一當頭棒。</p>
<h3>從前和現在</h3>

<h3>田莊主</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>去年這個時候，日宼的野戰砲和坦克車正在閘北合奏着［血花交響曲］的時候，收容我們一家三口的收容所的所長丨我的老姑丈，每天總是依着一定的時間，像説書先生説書似的講了許多故事給我們聽；其中就包括着這麽一叚悲壯熱烈的民間軼事。這一叚軼事的産生地是崇明！；長江口外的一個形勢最險要的孤島，而爲我們中國政府所自動放棄的國防要塞。時間大概是在前清道光或是同治年間，究竟是何年，何月，何時，那我可回報不出來了；好在和故事的本身，是並無怎樣重大關係的，就讓它含糊過去了吧！</p>
<p>落日射出了一派血一般紅的光芒，把遠處的一座柳林，映得綠葉齊變了紫色；林外一泓清水，也起了反光的作用，儼然是血流成渠模樣。</p>
<p>林之外是河，林之内却隱着一所絕大的莊院。</p>
<p>這時候，林和莊院中間的一片廣塲上，有六條毛色深黄，爪牙犀利的猛犬，在那裏互相追逐着，搏擊着，不住的發出一種獸類所共有的咆哮來，罩過了院子裏的人聲；塲的一隅，在一架練武用的大石擔的旁邊，却躺着一頭害癩病的花犬，伸出了一條淡紅色的長舌，用力喘氣，眼睛是張大着，很與奮地瞧它的同伴們演武，不過它自已是不能參加罷了。</p>
<p>［趙二哥！你好好地回去吧］屋子裏走出了兩個人來，在前的是一個少年的農人，不過他的腰已像弓一般的彎着，走兩步路，就得休息一步，神氣衰頽得像一個六十歲的老人一樣；後面送着他的却是一個身子像山一般挺立的老人，一尺多長的花白色的鬍鬚，在他眞像一件装飾品一樣，他身上雖然一般也是穿的土布做的衫袴，並没有華美的袍褂披着，可是人家見了他，自然就會發生一種敬服而畏信的感覺來，尤其是他的一雙奕奕有神的眸子，眞足以使一個犯着虚心病的人，見了他不能不逃走。</p>
<p>［莊主！我眞不知道怎樣報答你老人家才好］？患着癆病的趙二哥，用一種發抖的喉音，慢慢地説道：［欠了這幾年，你還是不來追究，我自已可也覺得太不好意思了！·····現在，但求···我的病能夠逐漸减輕我一定····</p>
<p>田莊主用一條鐵筋一般的胳膊，扶着趙二哥，望廣塲上走去。</p>
<h3>日僑語錄</h3>
<p>— 翼</p>
<p>丨關於侵華者丨</p>
<p>日軍閥迷信武力，肆行侵略，和戰前之德意志，簡直毫無區别！但是日本的人民，却未必完全同情侵華，反對的儘多着。上海有一個日本僑民，就是反對侵華的，我間接由他的一位華友口中聽得了許多話。他説：［政府（日）對華取開拓政策，不惜犧牲一切，冒險前進；但是在華僑民的思想，却不是［開拓］而是［安居樂業，得有固定的生活，九一八前，僑民無不安居樂業，九一八後，便大不安樂了；一二八一役，僑民除戰時遭受生命財産的損失外，並造成不少的失業者，至今不能恢復，痛苦不堪。所以僑民是不希望開拓的，而且是根本不希望，因爲開拓即使成功，人民亦沾不着福利。内地人民不曾遭遇切身利害，徒囿於狹義的虚榮的國家思想，他們纔附和政府的開拓政策。］他又説：［政府最初是想於極度不景氣中謀出路，而對東三省用兵，國際的不滿是早在意中的的；却不料東三省治安，不能迅速恢復，更憤於美國干涉，軍部便决心幹到底，准備對美决戰，近來全國上下，多抱着一枚銅元博進十元的思想，其意義是美爲强大海軍國，屢挫折日本，作侵華的障礙，倘决戰而勝，太平洋的霸權即操於日手，什麽問題都解决了；就是敗，而對手爲美，則雖敗亦榮。］這是日人説的話，可藉覘日本商民的眞正心理，和日軍閥迷信武力，鼓動人民的戰爭情緒之一斑。</p>
<h3>拉雜詬</h3>
<p>— 朱戮</p>
<p>光福的春</p>
<p>光福的春環境，雖仍籠罩在低暗的灰色境界喪；氣候是這　的寒冷，風，是這般的砰湃，然而當那陽光在裂開的雲隙中，照耀出暖和的光亮來，草，已漸漸透着嫰，綠，梅，也由粒粒紅豆，舒展成媚紅的花朶，是的，春已悄悄地回到大地來了。於是一班雅士騷人，尤其是在籌謀抵抗計劃的黨國偉人，公務多暇，互約着作［探梅之遊］。那以梅著名的光福鎭上，就時時發現着偉人冠蓋，和士女們的遊蹤了。</p>
<p>司徒廟古柏</p>
<p>因着遜清皇帝的封號，［清奇古怪］的司徒廟古柏，就成爲名騰全國的古物了。可是司徒廟的古柏，實際上却有七棵，一般的虬枝伸展，一般的翠葉凌空，然而成名的，却祗有［清奇古怪］四棵。眞覺使人不解？我友醉竹對我説這大約是乾隆皇帝遊到了司徒廟，見了這七棵古柏，自説了句［這古柏倒清奇古怪］的話，於是一班附龍的大人先生們，把這御言，硬封了四棵，紀念御駕的臨幸；還有三棵，因御言祗有四字，不敷分配，就做了不見經傳的無名英雄。醉竹的話，是不合於邏輯，照那不平等的待遇看來，總有一二分理由罷！</p>
<p>鄧尉山的梅</p>
<p>光福鎭上的梅，是隨地都有的。漠漠平林，四望皆花，連村蔽各，香雪成海。過了峙崦嶺，漫山遍野，盡是些梅林了。但鄧尉山因着漢鄧尉隱居的緣故，給一班偶像主義的信徒，煊染得自成一家。其實光福鎭的梅花，最足欣賞的，却在［天井］村上。那　的梅花，都是人工紥製的盆梅；重瓣絢縵，枝幹拳曲，好似畫眉燙髮的時代姑娘，經了精細的人工美容手術，美得確乎引人惹目，雖然伊祗是園林中的装飾品，而不能生利的。萬蒲潭畔雖建了香雪海的亭子，然而桑多於梅，已變做純盜虚聲的處士了。</p>
<p>窑上枇杷光福出産的果品，梅和楊梅以外，枇杷是很著名的。窰上産的白沙枇杷，核小肉厚，鮮甜可口，更是出色的佳果。那種枇杷，並不很大，微黄的皮撕去了，就變成一顆玉樣圓潤的水晶球。可惜它的産量不多，因此嗜食的人，出了巨價，依然嘗不到眞品。至於紅沙枇杷，比較多些，可是滋味，却没有白沙的甘美了。</p>
<p>石壁的竹</p>
<p>石壁是蟠螭山的别名。山南石壁塢，塢外石臺，直入太湖，天晴時登臨瞻眺，太湖中的嵐光雲影，沙鷗風帆，一一飛上几席，眞可謂極遊觀之樂。山上多竹修篁夾道，綠上衣袂，遊客們大都在竹上刻記小名，倚虹湖上詞中；有［山阿敎刻孤生竹惜取清遊記小名］的詞句，我寫到這裏，不禁起黄罏之感。</p>
<p>餘波　光福鎭距離蘇州，約有六十餘里。山有鄧尉，玄墓，銅并，石壁等，在左右拱衛。三萬六千頃的太湖，更鏡也似所展在前面。風景幽倩，出品富庶，確是個風景佳區。祗惜近年來蠶桑不利，果品又受了天時的侵害，内産减少。於是各村中，部逐漸地感到了不景氣，加着太湖的匪徒，綁掠刦奪，出没不定，於是一班稍有積蓄的鄉人，都逐漸地喬居鎭上，於是那可愛的勝地村落，暮氣已漸漸地增加着濃厚的成份。</p>

<p>糧食河下米静定之局</p>
<p>滬南昨來源仍以船戶糾紛、尚未解决、到船僅輪拖的四五號面已、城鄉作客寥寥、包胃呆滯、但以來源全無、市况見佳、蘇同帮價高一角、常帮中關貨亦高角許、青角薄稻以包胃滯澀、價居定局、南港等米亦見起色、杜洋尖無榮辱、變元去路停頓、價小角許、陰元去胃尚有、然爲數不夥、市無軒軯耳、</p>
<p>涸北各帮到船無綫、白粳店胃淡薄、四鄉無交、高貨定局、中次疲勢、薄　粳早稻到少銷平、價形疲勢、羊杜埠尖來源略有、走化呆滯、價下疲數分、客尖亦見軟勢陰元仍乏到、白元到雖無幾、胃溶均屬寥寥、致價又見疲落、</p>
<p>江北秈新到一批</p>
<p>紅米繼續上漲</p>
<p>昨日客秈市况、到銷兩活、到頭除有湘　各秈外、又新到江北客秈一批、貨品尚可、遂由本街完全辦去、價開七元六角半、福州帮胃口仍濃、本街亦有繼續問津、惟機晚等存到兩多、市面平軟、只有機紅與紅糙各檔、因市上存底不足、到頭有限、而本客胃口均佳、在市互相爭辦、價乃突漲一角以上、統市由閩帮去湖南紅糙一千七百七十包、價七元二角、次至六元九角半、本街去湘機紅米五百包、價七元三角二分至七元一角、江西機晚開二千五百包、内中由閩帮去二百包外、統由本街收進、價八元王角八分至八元三角云、</p>
<p>後市標粉逐步回好</p>
<p>昨日粉市、上午初穩繼平洋麥報價、回好一二角左右、故初開時、人心頗振、較前日好五厘至七九厘半不等以後各盤、本月份因客帮略有交易、市面仍穩、遠期則買氣較寂、似略平軟、迨至下午開盤、各月份步呈堅俏因山東及湖南帮進胃頗濃、尤以二三月份之買進爲更健、故各盤交易雖未見暢、市價則步步良好、惟華豐對於本月份、因有餘額、陸續脱去三四萬包、否則本月份之漲度、尚不至此也、至此後局面、如海上交易如常、來源究旺、似少過好之望、結果本月份較前日漲一分二厘半、三月份漲二分半、四月份漲一分、五月份漲一分二厘半、六月份漲一分、七月份漲七厘半、</p>
<p>期麥近跌遠平</p>
<p>昨日期麥上下午開盤後、各月份呈近跌遠平之象、本月份上午開價、已轉平勢、下午至收盤、則更不穩、因多頭均屬外行、無收貨能力、交割已近、不得不脱手了結、因此收價竟跌至三兩二錢六分、較前日跌三分、遠期各月、大致盤旋、出入不多、結果三月份較前日好一分、四月份不動、五六月份未開、七月份小一分、二十一日芝加哥電、小麥先因利物浦市况報小而跌、後因冬季出産情形欠佳回漲、又上日成交一千萬薄歇爾、道瓊斯指數如左、</p>

<p>黄荳銷動市堅</p>
<p>黄荳廠胃活潑、市見升漲、昨市成交火車荳七車、後情如去胃不斷、尚有續升之望、惟餅銷因廠方出貨日遲、去胃略懈、恐防辦荳落淡、市况不免帶軟耳、紅糧近日新貨到頭見接、而去路則有内地零戶動動、故市面平疲、油情因來源陸續、走化平淡、致市疲軟、</p>
<p>糖市潮青糖號盤略跌</p>
<p>昨日糖市雖有標金之回漲、但交易仍稀、如二四粗砂白各行日前所進現貨已可出棧、故公會劃盤交易更寥、愈足增其疲勢、統市僅二百包之成交、價爲十五兩四錢五分、二十號中砂白十五兩二錢半、八九十號荷赤呌十二兩一二三錢、均少受手、潮帮號家續開潮青一批、計六百包之譜、價爲九兩半至九兩、比前跌錢許、又開足上冰五十餘包、色味均佳、本可稍漲、惟逄洋糖步降、仍開十六兩、建冰因存底軋缺、前日雖有續到、爲數不多、故衆疲獨俏、零星開出、反升一二錢、趨勢穩固</p>
<p>南北貨木耳漲風頗勁</p>
<p>木耳邇來地頭市復步升、據漢口函訊、現市高貨五十四兩、以次爲五十二三兩、加上一切外費、开申須六十四五兩之譜、此間客貨漲勢更甚、高川耳開至六十七兩、比前又升三兩、同時行盤雖有跟漲、未能過高、本牌耳售過六十二兩、普通貨六十兩、亦升二三兩、後市如銷路轉暢、勢必續升、</p>
<p>絲茶歐美絲銷難望轉機</p>
<p>昨日本埠洋莊絲市、仍乏轉機之望、緣横濱等處日貨賣氣盛而價益下落、歐美絲織商手中存絲充厚、期絲均無進胃、是以絲電不轉、</p>
<p>人造絲二百餘箱運烟青</p>
<p>近兩日中、本埠人造絲輸出突旺、昨安生等輪由滬開出、魯綢商共有人造絲二百六十箱装往烟台青島威海衛等埠、昨市公會上本月份現期貨客銷仍不寂寞、長江帮等又進中身貨三十二箱、價仍堅挺、</p>
<p>白絲頭百餘件運往孟買</p>
<p>今歲絲頭出口、仍難轉暢、前日英郵乃奇普道號由滬出口、祇安利等有長吐繭衣等白絲頭一百二十件装往孟買、</p>
<p>汕市輾轉中的白桐油</p>
<p>白桐油自洋莊銷塲减少後、市塲上絕少蓬勃氣象、廢曆年關過後漢口洋行曾辦過一批、計有千噸光景、價格計十五兩四錢三十五兩七錢五分、近日又低落至十五兩六　矣市情之不能振作、不言而喻、浙路金華蘭溪一帶、亦因銷呆極疲、惟杭州行家於春盤初開時循例照臘底加起幾何然不旋踵仍見回落、近　杭行定價二十二元七八角、依然銷難發展、開金蘭售新規砠二十一元入角送杭江于交貨、大概以此爲丘市、總之漢市不振浙桐斷難獨樹一幟、以現市而論、漲旣不能、跌亦難望、莫非輾轉而已、</p>

<p>湘産紅蓮浙白蓮。産於湖南等。約略可分五種。（一）［湘潭蓮］色紅。粒同整而而大。碎粒３</p>

<p>蓮子去衣。頗爲費時。其實去衣尚　易事。可於蓮子中加咸少許。用　水冲之。俟</p>
<p>其蓮衣發浮。放於淘籮内擦之。其衣卽去。再以清水漂洗清凈。惟去心必須逐一從心根之一端。用較粗銀針剌入卽出。（或竹針）如是則個個完整不碎。</p>
<p>普通食法。以水發透去衣去心。用文火煮熟。似酥而不碎爲度。加白糖或紅棗芡　食之。甘芬可口。久食有益。如欲煮糖蓮心。可先和水煮色。不可過酥。然後浸入蜜汁或糖汗内。俟其浸透。取出唒乾。再以上好白糖煎成濃厚膏狀。將浸過之蓮心放人。拌匀候乾卽成。其他如蓮心粥。蓮蓉餅。八寳飯等。在在皆有需要。　湘蓮之特色。乾燥後如不將蓮之外殻敲去。以其殻堅硬。保護之力甚强。可以藏　翌年見新前去殻出售。不亞新蓮。故名殻衷新。惟身軟者易姓。而於黄霉前更宜注意。重晒或放於冷氣棧。可免霉蛀。如用火烘焙。雖可免患。然煮食時不能酥軟。</p>
<p>白蓮産於浙之蘭谿。色白微帶紅包。個粒較湘蓮爲粗。而不甚圓整。身份乾。色之過白者往往係爲熏色。故煮食時不如湘蓮之酥軟可口。</p>

<h3>［兩面光］</h3>
<p>— 屠仰慈</p>
<p>［兩面光］是中國人待人接物的秘訣，也是處世的良良。一個人祗要能夠做事圓通，左右不得罪人，就使有人偶然故意爲難，還是笑臉相見，表示親善，自然决不會有人出來與他作對，這就是［兩面光］的成功，也是圓通朋友的勝利。今日名利雙全的先生們，莫不深知此中三昧。</p>
<p>國事有如人事，國事也正是人事。［兩面光］旣是一個人待人接物的秘訣，處世的良方，處理國家大事，自然也用得着［兩面光］這件法寳。否則一味戇直，終究吃虧。幸而現在的達官貴人，對此了解極透，運用尤熟，故目前國難日急，而中國終於能倖存於世界。</p>
<p>别的事姑且不説，單看這一次的中日交涉，我們的政府也就眞盡了［兩面光］之能事。譬如東北事變初起的時候，一方面向國聯申訴日本爲無理，儼如敵國，一方面又與日本信使往還，客客氣氣地大談其外交經。雖然日軍的砲彈打毁了整個東北，我們的當局始終不曾翻過一次臉。很多人以爲當局這種態度不興，其實此即［兩面光］政策之運用也。</p>
<p>［一二八］事件的爆發，頑强的日軍毁滅了繁華的上海。死於日軍鐵蹄下的人民不可勝計，喪失於日機轟炸下的財産不可勝計，這時候，我們的政府急急忙忙搬到了洛陽去避難，一邊摩拳擦掌的［準備長期抵抗］，一邊又與日本的外交家杯酒言歡，終而至於［和平告成］，化大事爲小事，此又［兩面光］政策之運用也。</p>
<p>目前日本軍又總攻熱河了，消息傳來，全國憤怒！然而政府在［一面交涉，一面抵抗］之餘，似乎還有人主張繼續簽訂快將滿期的中國商約。並且還高談［互惠］！此又［兩面光］政策之運用也。</p>
<p>完全國粹的［兩面光］，就有這麽偉大的用處，在這暴風狂雨的時代裏，老大的中國還能苟安於東亞，即全靠大人先生們［兩面光］政策之運用得當！</p>
<h3>遥想的美</h3>
<p>— 稼書</p>
<p>每人都這樣的境况吧？</p>
<p>在異地的時候，逢到良辰佳節，就會不自主地感到寂寞，想起家鄉，發出一縷悠然神往的詩情！</p>
<p>這縷詩情，有的是觸景生情，有所聯想；有的是旅人思家，想到故鄉的可愛，有所憧憬。</p>
<p>像這類憧憬的詩情，古人從美麗的詩句中流露出來的很多！例如：</p>
<p>［三五夜中新月色，二千里外故人心］！</p>
<p>看到清光的月，就會憶念到在二千里外的友人。</p>
<p>［獨在異鄉爲異客，每逢佳節倍思親］！</p>
<p>獨居他鄉，看到佳節時的一切景物，就不自主的想念到雙親：這都是有所聯想，有所憶念。當其境者，因爲感覺一種凄酸的味道，所以能吟出這樣的詩句。</p>
<p>作這兩句詩的［詩人］，如果當時便達到回家的願望，他們也許不會覺得怎麽滿足的，他們再哼這兩句詩時，也許不會像在異鄉憧憬着故鄉時那樣有味了。［不見時，准備着千言萬語：到相逢，都變做了短嘆長吁！］</p>
<p>這是從經騐中表明［遥想的美］幻滅後的惆悵。</p>
<p>這種［遥想的美］是人類最富於詩意的一種情緒。</p>
<h3>探監</h3>
<p>— 李輝英</p>
<p>找人麽］？</p>
<p>［是的。］</p>
<p>［打那一個，知道號頭麽？］</p>
<p>［找吳ＸＸ，五十Ｘ號。］</p>
<p>［你呌什麽，那塊人？］</p>
<p>［呌ＸＸＸ，是江蘇人。］</p>
<p>［親戚麽？］</p>
<p>［朋友。］</p>
<p>［好，等一下。］</p>
<p>照着門崗的指示，我走進ＸＸ監獄的門房，還不等我先開口問話，那門房到是一句跟一句的先問起來我。我呢，只好照他的問話，按條回答。他　　起來是個三十歳左右的人，同旁人一樣的頭上有鼻子，眼晴，嘴；身上有手脚。就是有一樣事，我覺得他總有些和别人不同，那就是他的神氣，眞的，一直到他問完我這一套話，他那比起官吏還另有不同的神氣，依然存在着。不由的，我忽然感覺到，這地方好像並不是屬於世界上的一部分。</p>
<p>［有東西麽，要看一看。］他看着我手衷提有一個紙包，問。</p>
<p>［一些書。］</p>
<p>［書要先放在這塊檢查一下，不能就送進去的。］</p>
<p>自然，我聽從了他的話。接着，在簿子上留了名，我就跟他往院裏走。這個還未脱離地球的院子，向我吐着森嚴的大嘴，像在等待着要把我吞嚼了似的。尤其是那些持槍的獄卒，實在使我害怕：要不是已經走上了台堦，我眞會向那位門房要求着説：［對不起，人不舒服，今天我不看了。］但我終於走進了第一科。</p>
<p>然後，到第二科，這屋裏的人，每人的面孔，都是絕頂的嚴肅凶狠，又全然不是門房同門崗所比得上的，這使我忽然想到小時候在廟上看到的花臉鐐牙的泥像，他們之間，僅僅是身子高低和衣服的不同而已。</p>
<p>一個四方的板格屋，　的大小頂多祗能容下兩個人並立，我被獄卒帶到頭。站在那裏，面對着一個通内屋的圓板口，一個只容一個人的臉孔的地方，我這時明白我所處的地位了，知道了這就是我探看ＸＸ兩下説話的地方。　［就是這地方，不許動。］獄卒命令着我，然後轉身看着對面牆上寫給監犯看的藍底白字的標語。</p>
<p>我爲什麽要動呢，我爲什麽要在這裏動呢，不是伸出手就會撞到板牆麽？</p>
<p>從板縫中，我看出隱約有兩個人，站在圓口的裏邊，這，我也明白是幹什麽的。</p>
<p>花喇的響聲，漸近漸大的傳過來，自然是脚鐐聲呀。圓口地方，在響聲停止後，露出了ＸＸ的臉。</p>
<p>［ＸＸ！］他驚訝的呌了一聲，好像想不到我在這一時會來看他似的。他的眼睛紅了。咬一下牙，像咬跑了所有的痛苦，他口吃的説，］你····好···麽？］</p>
<p>［我一切都好，你好麽？你要什麽東西麽？你别急，冤枉的事情總有一天會明白的，我們一直到現在還在爲你想法子，你有家信來麽？］一口氣説到這裏，再以後應該説些什麽話，我可不知道了，不，全然説不出來了！到這兒之前，本預備有一些話，但這時忘得净净的，怎樣也想不起來，倒是聽他説了好一大套話。他要我們不要爲他太着急，現在冤枉入獄的人，並不止他一個，這是没法伸述的。他又説在獄裏還好，一定不要朋友們惦念他，他又説别的話，説到後來，兩滴眼涙，清清楚楚的從他那對大眼中擠了出來</p>
<p>［你到比從前眫了呢。］没有話説，爲的避去他的悲痛，過一會，我這麽説。［畫，這回帶來幾本，檢查完了，過幾天你就會看到的。］我想起了那幾本書。</p>
<p>［呵，好極了···］</p>
<p>［好啦！］不等他説完，獄卒凶狠的説着就把他拖走了。我再没有看清他的臉，只聽到脚鐐聲同他説的［再見罷］的最後一句話。</p>
<p>這時，我不知道怎樣是好，不管ＸＸ	是否聽到，我隔着格板，急急的嚷着説：［好，我們再會。］</p>
<p>他去了，什麽聲響都没有了，這時，那看標語的獄卒回轉身來，雖然没有下什麽命令，可是我從他的眼光中，看出來他在催我走。於是在獄卒的監視之下，我慢慢的走出了獄門。　［究竟他是犯了什麽罪呢，一個二十歲還不到的青年？］看着那高高的獄牆，想起ＸＸ眼中擠出的兩滴眼涙與脚鐐的響聲，終不能不使我懷欵起來。我不明白，我解答不出，但我深切的知道，在現代，同樣的因爲解答不出的事而受難的人，正不知有幾千百萬呢！</p>
<h3>黑女求神記（九）</h3>
<p>— 蕭伯納作　宜閑譯</p>
<p>［下來罷，］黑女孩子説。［你應當知道鯽魚是只在近河的地方，纔可以見到的。我不過試做着一個實騐罷了。下來罷。］</p>
<p>［我怎麽下來呢？］那近視眼顫抖着説。［我要跌斷項頭的。］　［你怎麽上去的？］黑女孩子説。</p>
<p>［我没有知道，］他回答，幾乎下涙了。［這够使一個人相信奇跡了。我原是不能爬上這株樹的；可是我在這裏了，我决不能再下去了。］</p>
<p>［一個很有興味的實騐呀，可不是麽？］黑女孩子説。</p>
<p>［一個刻薄得可惡的實騐，你這惡毒的女孩子，］他呻呼了。</p>
<p>［請你心裏想一想罷，你要斷送我的性命的。你想，你怎麽可以將强烈的震動加於像我這］</p>
<p>樣文弱的生理學的有機體，不至於在心臟上發生，簡直有致命的反應呢？我一輩子再也不能在木頭上坐了。我雖然不能數自已的脈膊，却相信這脈膊十分變態了；如果我放鬆了這枒枝，我就要石頭一般翻落了。</p>
<p>［如果你能够剖出半個狗腦子來，不使牠的口涎上起什麽反應，那你就用不着愁了。］她從容地説。［我想亞非利加的魔術是比你從狗身上的推測有力得多了。我對你説了一句話，就使你貓一般地爬上一株樹了。你承認這是奇蹟罷。］</p>
<p>［你可否再説一句話，使我平安地下去呢，你這黑妖女］。他咕嚕了。　［這我可以的，］衷黑女孩子説。［你項頭頸背後有一條樹蛇嗅着啦。］</p>
<p>那近視眼霎時間就在地上。他終於仰天地着陸了；然而他却立卽扖起身來，説道：［不要以爲我上了當呵，我没有上你的當啦。我十分明白：你假造出蛇來嚇我。］</p>
<p>［可是你嚇得彷彿這是一條眞蛇似的，］黑女孩子説。</p>
<p>［我没有嚇］那近視眼忿忿地説。［一點也没有嚇。］</p>
<h3>蘧廬絮語</h3>
<p>— 子展</p>
<p>（七）章太炎先生之瘋顚哲學章太炎先生自上海出獄，卽東渡日本，大受［排滿］之革命黨人歡迎，並延主民報編輯。章先生在歡迎會上自述生平及其志向，卽載當時民報第六號。其中一段論瘋顚與神經病，極有見地，百僅章先生爲自已解嘲已也。文爲白話：</p>
<p>［大概爲人在世，被他人説個瘋顚，斷然　不肯承認，除那笑傲山水詩豪畫伯一流人　、又作别論，其餘總是一樣、獨有兄弟却承　認我是瘋顚，我是有神經病。而且聽見説　我瘋顚，説我有神經病的話，倒反格外高　興。爲甚麽緣故呢？大凡非常可怪的議論　，不是神經病人斷不能想，就能想也不敢　説；説了以後，遇著艱難困苦的時候，不　是神經病人斷不能百折不回·孤行已意；　所以古來有大學問成大事業的，必得有神　經病纔能做到。諸君且看那希臘哲學家瑣　格拉底；可不是有神經病的麽？那提出民　權自由的路索，爲追一狗，跳過河去，這　也實在是神經病。那回敎初祖摩罕默德，　據今日宗敎學家論定，是有臟燥病的。像　我漢人，明朝熊廷弼的兵略，古來無二，　然而看他氣性，傳説熊廷弼剪截是個瘋子　。近代左宗棠的爲人，保護滿奴，殘殺同　類，原是不足道的，但他那出奇制勝的方　略，畢竟令人偑服。這左宗棠少年在嶽麓　書院的事，種種奇怪，想是人人共知。更　有畢士馬克，曾經在旅館裏頭，呌喚堂官　，没有答應，便就開起槍來，這是何等性　情呢？仔細看來，那六人才典功業，都是　由神經病裏流出來的。爲這緣故，兄弟承　認自已有神經病，也願諸位同志人人個個　都有一兩分的神經病。近來有人傳説，某　某是有神經病，某某也是有神經病。兄弟　看來，不怕有神經病，只怕富貴利祿當面　現前的時候，那神經病立刻好了，這纔是　要不得呢！略高一點的人，富貴利祿的補　劑雖不能治他的神經病，那艱難困苦的毒　還是可以治得的。這總是脚跟不穩，不　能成就甚麽氣候。兄弟嘗這毒劑是最多的　，算來自成戌年以後，已有七次查拿，六　次都拿不到，到第七次方纔拿到。以前三　次或因别事株連，或是普拿新黨，不專爲　我一人，後來四次，却都爲逐滿獨立的事　。但兄弟在這艱難困苦的盤渦裏頭，並没　有一絲一毫的懊悔。憑你甚麽毒劑，這神　經病總治不好，或者諸君推重，也未必不　由於此。若有人説，假如人人有神經病，　辦事必定亂，怎得有個條理。但兄弟所　説的神經病，並不是粗豪鹵莽，亂打亂跳　，要把那細針密縷的思想装載在神經病裏　。譬如思想是個貨物，神經病是個汽船，　没有思想，空空洞洞的神經病必無實濟；　没有神經病，這思想可能自動的麽？］</p>
<p>此篇演説辭未見收於章太炎的白話文一書，未知何故。三十年前，章先生固一嶄新人物，不僅肯作白話文，尚有若干議論，卽令現令當路在勢之革命新人物聞之，恐亦駭怪不已也。</p>

<h3>死得其所</h3>
<p>— 天方</p>
<p>前日報載有一年約四十餘歳的人力車夫，手挽人力車一輛，行至本城三牌樓附近，將車輛停於路畔，已則坐於脚踏板上，雙目緊閉，狀如静息，不料就此一息不醒，氣絕殞命，旋經路人覺察，投報該管警所云，記者先生所加的標題是，人力車夫死得奇特</p>
<p>［死］本來是很平凡的一件事，丨凡有生命的東西都逃不了這一個階段，所可，奇特的，就是不死於寳隆醫院不死於公館而死於人力車的一脚踏板上］這一點。但轉念一想，這也很平凡，這年頭，誰都保不住明天的生命，譬如我今天説錯了話，明天頭顱搬了家，或是胸口穿上一個透明的窟窿也説不定，像我們的同道鎭江劉，就這樣的得到主席［大老爺］的思典，送登歷史人名錄上去了，這又誰能料得到呢？這就是小焉者，你看報載甘肅十七八歲的大姑娘還没有褲子穿兩湖災民數百萬，那個又保得住生命，在這人吃人的時代，，是誰都有被人吃掉的機會，丨當然要人不在内像這位四十餘歲的老同胞，雖然有氣力拉得動車，但年已活了四十餘歲，還没有做到封翁，而只替人拉車，這顯見是一個弱者，現在幸蒙［民恩浩蕩］，容留在天地間，替代牛馬之勞，賜其全屍，不致被人吃掉，已是天高地厚，雖死於人力車的脚踏板上，在旁人看來或許有點奇特，但説一句自寛慰的話，也可説是［壽終正寢］，較隨便給人什麽［動］，動掉了頭顱的，已勝多多。此老有知也該瞑目。</p>
<p>嗚呼，兢兢業業者旣壽終正寢於人力車上，口誅筆作之徒，其不得死所歟</p>

<h3>演劇</h3>
<p>— 洪水</p>
<p>我們校裏已經决定九日演劇。</p>
<p>Ｈ本是生得怪瘦的，容貌又分外醜：眞巧，老王却是一個肥頭大腦，雪白滾壯的漢子。差不多每次表演中，他倆已成了缺少不了的角色，同學們都笑他倆是天生的一對東方勞萊與哈臺！</p>
<p>的確，他們不是來求學，而是爲的追求享樂。尤其一般女演員（自然是女）同學），她們畢竟來得聰敏，簡直可以不翻書本，因爲校長的寵愛，敎師的鍾情，學期考試滿可不成問題的派司過去。</p>
<p>這是一個久雨新霽的午後他們開始預演劇本了。</p>
<p>［先生，小姐！東北已經淪亡，他在祇有忠勇的義勇軍爲我們收復失地，在那裏與倭奴作殊死戰！可憐得很，他們的寒衣，糧秣都鮮有接濟，連得殺敵的槍彈都不夠分配丨何能與暴日打戰呢？唉！請你們快捐些錢去接濟啦，這是關係中華民族生死存亡的最後命運啊！］Ｈ扮飾一個募捐隊隊長，穿的很樸素，站在一爿酒樓中向着一對年青夫婦誠摯物這樣勸解。</p>
<p>［唔！］那男的做出不肯捐的樣子。望了女的一眼，然後視線慢慢的移向Ｈ來，僅僅［唔］了一聲。</p>
<p>［雖則所捐區區，大家慷慨捐助，齊沙成塔，爲數！］</p>
<p>［啊？你同他晚囌做什？］女的装出惱怒的樣兒，一手便扯着男的衣袖。　　［你們這班摩登小姐，腦袋裏絲毫不懂得愛國思想！你們的錢，樂意化在香粉，口紅，高跟鞋上，流人入洋人的袋裏；一生沉淪在奢你淫蕩的生活裏，你們確乎是道地十足未來的亡國奴！啊，你們這班亡國奴！］</p>
<p>［·····］説也好笑，經Ｈ在舞臺上如此咒駡着一般祗知自已享樂而没有國家觀念的女性，她果眞會撒嬌地細聲哭着。</p>
<p>［喂！密絲金，怎會哭呢？哈哈哈。王先生拿起導演的資格問着，放聲大笑着。</p>
<p>［我不幹了，絕對不幹！［</p>
<p>［有什麽關係呢，這不過暴露現社會裏女性的弱點，使一般觀衆有所醒覺····］</p>
<p>［我不···誰願做亡國奴？］她依然鳴咽着：［我是大中華民國的人民，我願爲她求生存而死·····］</p>
<p>［對不住呵，密絲金，雖説這是情　感作用，即此可看出你并不像劇中女性的那樣荒唐萎靡！總之，在排演之前，没有考慮你的個性，實在抱歉的。］　［以後絕對不再參加表演！］</p>
<p>［呃！等會演習完畢去吃咖啡和請看電影。］最後王導演祗好嘻皮笑臉的賠着小心。</p>
<p>［一同去。］老王也凑趣着。</p>
<p>［大家一同去！］</p>
<p>Ｈ望見密絲金已在她殷紅的印滿涙珠的臉蛋上露着輕微的笑痕時，才深深的倒抽一口摒息了好久的冷氣！</p>
<h3>險如風中之燭</h3>
<p>— 青木</p>
<h3>春</h3>
<p>— 一萍</p>
<p>雖然窗外下着絲絲雨片，但春的氣像却已來到了人間。</p>
<p>院子里不知名的小花，吐着含苞未放的蓓蕾；一排常綠的冬青，也偷偷的吐出嫩綠的小葉。雨天，一種被窒息着的周遭，像黄梅時節一樣的不舒適。Ｓ小姐隔着窗，從烟霧迷濛中呆看都市的建築，或者母寗説她做着美麗的夢吧。忽然她挺了挺嬌慵無力的腰肢，放下窗帘，下意識的向梳装台走來。</p>
<p>鏡中露出一個遲春的少女？她攏了攏蓬亂的髮鬢，想起過去的浪漫生活。　一個被色情誘惑包圍着的少女，仗着自已的青春，博得許多異性熱烈的追求憑自已的交際手腕，玩弄着他們。每天没有起身的時候，會客室中已坐滿了獻媚的青年，祗要今天Ｓ小姐允許了誰的請求，就認爲無上的光榮。所以她的足趾所及，總有一個漂亮的伴侶，像小狗一樣的追隨在左右。</p>
<p>每一個春的轉變。她呆望着自已褪去了青春的鏡中人影，緊緊的鎖了眉心，好似仇恨青春到那裏去了。有時故意緊緊睡衣的邊緣，蹺起右腿，左腿乘勢在地板上轉了個半圓形。豐腴的背影襯在睡衣的擺動中，自信還有幾分迷人的魔力。於是她想起了從前被她玩弄過的［小弟弟，］她希望使［小弟弟］再投到自已的懷中來，也是無上的光榮。</p>
<p>她滿意的幻想着，自已的心正像在空中飄蕩一樣，四肢也似乎隨着身子上升，陡的兩朶紅暈飛上她的鬢邊像捉住了青春到那裏去了的答案。她微微暗笑的時候，婢子推進門來説：［蕭先生電話來，今天接他外國回來的朋友去······］</p>
<p>額際的皺紋，遮住了微微的暗笑。她明知青春是再也不能歸來的了，但不能再給與她一刹那間的快感嗎？兩顆水珠慢的從睫毛中掛下來；一個心却貪婪的飛進了幾年前的景界。</p>
<p>雖然窗外下着絲絲的雨片，但春的氣息却已來到了人間。</p>
<h3>ＸＸ大戰ＸＸ</h3>
<p>— 永清</p>
<p>老張跑過逸園。看見兩邊票洞門前黑壓壓地擠滿了人。紅紅綠綠的體育評論呌賣聲，一字長蛇陣的汽車：使他頓時頷悟道：</p>
<p>哦丨今天是禮拜六，可不是有一塲劇烈的足球賽麽。</p>

<h3>良心上感覺不安</h3>
<p>— 吳江</p>
<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>我不會説客氣話，但我確信你决不至於因爲我不會客氣，而置我的問題於不答。我所問的是：</p>
<p>去年我無意間愛上了我的表妹，進一步而向她求婚，她因爲一時誤會，很迅速的以［已字人］做招牌來拒絕我；我那時是無疑的受了重大的打擊，覺得人生的無味，要想自殺。可是遍遍又給在鄉的父母知道，很迅速的代我定下了一門親事，我那時因處於昏迷的環境中，所以含糊同意了。迨至今年一月，表妹因不滿意她完全由父母作主的盲目式婚姻，把那邊退了。同時開始領會到我的情意，而向我懺悔。我的心又在動摇了，我想把我已經同意過的婚約解除；不過我良心上又感覺到不安，因爲她如果有了像我對於表妹一樣的專意，聽到了這不幸的消息，不是將和我同樣的受精神上打擊，而或竟至於···嗎？假使不解除，則我一生的幸福，又將整個的犧牲了！我處於兩難的地位，務祈先生不吝賜敎，借貴報一幅地，詳細答覆我。敬祝進步！吳江上。</p>
<p>編者按：讀了吳君的來信，覺得他的心，未免也太會動摇了些。從來信看來，至少有下列三點，可以假定的。（一）當吳君向他的表妹求婚時，她所以拒絕的理由，多半是因爲［業已字人］；此時她對於吳君還没有相當認識；同時對於她父母你訂的未婚夫，也並没有發現充分理由，去强烈的拒絕他。爲了避免煩惱起見，很乾脆地拒絕吳君，使他死心榻地的去另找出路；這種態度，倒很光明磊落。（二）她這次與她未婚夫解約的動機，完全是因爲不滿這盲目式的婚姻，與吳君毫没有關係；不過在解約之後，開始選擇快壻的時候，才回憶前情罷了。（三）他現在訂定的那位未婚妻，雖不能像他表妹那樣，稱他的心意，致使他的心，會動摇起來；不過也不致絕對不能相合，因爲這究竟是經過他同意的呀。所以我們以爲吳君不妨以［業已訂婚］四個字，拒絕他表妹［即以其人之道，還治其人之身，］本没有什麽虧心；何况這反可使她也死心榻地的去另找愛人呢。至於上面的三個假定，第一個絕對不會錯的。第二個呢，吳君的表妹，或許因爲還没有知道吳君［業已訂婚］，所以她的解約，與吳君有多少關係。但這是她的一相情願，安有自已拒絕了人家，反不許人家另找出路的道理呢。第三個呢，即使他的未婚妻，不幸竟太差了些，但是爲着已經同意過的緣故，在法律上，道德上，都有暫時忍耐的義務。</p>

<h3>詩禮人家（一七續）</h3>
<p>— 汪仲賢</p>
<p>若華眼睛定了，望着黛秋，凄然問道：［好孩子，你不是一向恨他的嗎？怎麽····］</p>
<p>黛秋毅然答道：［是的丨我一向恨他，就是恨他不該同你發生戀愛，現在他起過誓了，愛了我之後，永不再愛别人，所以我不恨他了！］</p>
<p>若華聽得目瞪口呆，手裏還是不肯放鬆。</p>
<p>幼中拼命要想掙脱。若華看看有些支持不住，這才發瘋似的狂呌起來：　　［這是殺我女壻的兇手丨救命！</p>
<p>幼中低聲警告她道：</p>
<p>［你是謀殺我哥哥的惡婦！警察來了大家没有好處，我勸你還是放手的好！］</p>
<p>若華不顧一切，還是狂喊救命。忽然外面來了許多脚聲。幼中心慌意亂，舉起脚來狠命的向她小腹上踢去。她着了痛，捧了肚皮坐在地下。幼中拉了黛秋出來，迎頭撞着合家婢僕，聽得救命聲音，進來探視。幼中對他們説：</p>
<p>［太太得了急病，我同小姐請醫生去。］</p>
<p>幼中騙過了家人，與黛秋飛步出門，誰知奔到墻門裏，却被一個小孩子一把抱住大腿，躺在地下死也不肯放鬆。幼中低頭一看，認得他正是被若華驅逐出門的螟蛉子夏茂生。幼中惱他攔住去路，提起衣箱向他頭上亂撞，他就在地下一啕大哭起來。桑阿强和阿麗一齊擁上來，説幼中欺負阿麗的兄弟，將幼中一把扭住。幼中要想使勁掙脱，裁縫司務一齊放下針線，將他團團圍住，不多一刻，警察來了，就將幼中和黛秋一齊捉了進去。</p>
<p>幼中到了獄裏，就永無脱身之日了。茂生居然請了律師，控告幼中與若華通姦，父親仲南生死不明，請求伸寃。審判的結果，幼中若華都難逃法網。一往情深的黛秋，因爲禍根都由自已身上所起，願與幼中一同坐獄，竟自供認謀殺趙家楝，他也是主某之一，鄭濟平當然開釋。茂生歸宗姓夏，算是夏二房的承繼人</p>
<p>以前茂生被逐出門，桑老板知道靠他身上將來有利可圖，便將他秘密留養着，恰巧逢着夏家發生了連一接二的内訌，阿强便乘虚而入，將這個不成材的野種捧進來做了正統。夏家共有五房，伯東與北不是没有子孫，怎奈這兩個都是無用的懦夫，聽見二房裏出了變故，一個個不敢問信。他們都抱着［縮頭主義丨］</p>
<p>茂生承襲了家産，實權都在桑阿强手裏。茂生要用錢，須向阿麗支取。他們又逼茂生寫了一張全部房産的抵押據，並且放任他出去嫖賭抽烟。不多幾年，他依舊去做他的流浪人，姓夏的詩禮人家，却淪爲市儈管理的大成衣舗了。門口還掛着一塊桑强記的大招牌丨（完　）</p>

<h3>女頑童古拉蘇的故事</h3>
<p>— 興之</p>
<p>古拉蘇Ｃora　Ｓue没有到好萊塢之前跟她母親住在紐約。那時她祗有五歲，她母親同她去年了一次［頑童賈克古柏］回到家裏，她就照着賈克古柏在銀幕上的神情摩倣着。她母親看了好笑，便講賈克古柏的故事給她聽。她聽到賈克古柏在好萊塢名氣很大，收入很多，她就吵着要到好萊塢去。母親問她去作什麽，她回説去做賈克古柏的事。母親騙着她，但她只是吵着要去。她母親被她吵了幾天，祇好同她到了好萊塢。</p>
<p>在好萊塢住了二個月。雖然古拉蘇的母親深信她的女兒有賈克古柏般的能力，但是碰不到機會。一天，她在路上遇着一個别了很久的女友。相談之下，才知道是在環球公司做事。她就問她的朋友五六歲的孩子，影片公司有没有僱用的。巧極了，環球公司正在添聘童星。於是她就託她的朋友介紹古拉蘇。度接洽，就被環球公司錄取了。</p>
<p>古拉蘇進環球第一天，就開始和滑稽家散蘇碧慈ＺaＳuＰitts及桑麥維爾Ｓiim　Ｓummervile合演［便宜爹爹］ＴheＵnexpectedＦather。不用怎樣叮囑，她r</p>
<p>好像老於演劇的一般。她第一天的成績驚動了全好萊塢。</p>
<p>［便宜爹爹］攝製完成，古拉蘇演得活像克萊拉寳，她就得着了［安頑童］的雅號，而與賈克古柏的［頑童］兩相媲美了。</p>
<p>古拉蘇演完了［便宜爹爹］，給派拉蒙公司向環球借了去，攝演一張Ｔhe</p>
<p>Ｓtrange　Ｃase　of　Ｃlara　Ｄeaneo導演呌她扮一個孤兒，她照着做去，演來畢肖一個可憐的孤兒。</p>
<p>接着米高悔公司出了重金向環球借了古拉蘇去，和瑙瑪希拉克拉克蓋寳合演ＳmifinＴhrough。這時，她雖然踏進影界才二個月，竟能和聞名世界的紅角在一起做事了。</p>
<p>米高梅的片子還没有攝竣，華納公司又要請她去了，華納的片子是愛德華羅賓生的ＳilverＤollr。</p>
<p>古拉蘇有一個特長，她善於妝哭。愛德華羅賓生在ＳiluerＤollar中末一段是演的死，所以一定要有個妝哭的孩子。那個孩子更是除了古拉蘇不容易找了。那天攝到這一段，愛德華死了，古拉蘇流涕痛哭，令人見酸鼻。一回兒攝好了，愛德華跳了起來，預備回去了。古拉蘇握着愛德華的手道：［再會丨愛德華先生，但是我很懊惱，因爲你死了？］德愛德華和皮妲妮兒被她一説，笑得説不出話來。</p>
<p>觀衆意見</p>
<h3>譚［城市之夜］</h3>
<p>— 英自蘇州寄</p>
<p>城市之夜是聯華第一廠的最近巨構，我很幸運的能在蘇州大光明影院先覩爲快。</p>
<p>主角阮玲玉（女兒）金燄（富家子）的藝術，社會上早有定評，無庸再來介紹。其次黎鏗（小弟弟）亦是一顆新進的小明星。劉繼羣（表哥）還可以過得去。作苦力的嵇某，雖然有了很重的病而臉上並不帶病容。猶是胖胖的，化装上似欠斟酌。</p>
<p>關於技術方面光線似稍暗了些。夜景太多但還好。</p>
<p>編劇者的手腕，着實巧妙，對於所要描寫的對象，絲毫不肯放鬆，處處顯現着貧富的對照。能在小地方陪襯出階級的懸殊；被壓迫者呐喊。</p>
<p>此外關於導演，的確自始至終找不出絲毫破綻。特别是如苦力和他的女兒未到家之前，房子已因雨而塌漏了，小兒子躱在桌子下面笑。不但使觀衆感到小孩兒的滑稽，而更使觀者灑一把同情涙。</p>
<p>全片約長一千二百餘　，是一部整個兒描寫貧富階級兩種生活的一片段。　綜合全片的一切，已超過了從前的紀錄，雖然因爲環境所限，尚不能與歐美的上上作品相比，然而牠已足以壓倒許多舶來片了。</p>
<p>今年是國貨年，大家應當提倡國片了，何况這一張國片，是值得提倡的呢</p>
<h3>談［五重血案］</h3>
<p>— 郭聲宏</p>
<p>克拉勃洛克傑作的［福爾摩斯探案一是一部驚險的偵探巨片雜以愛情，而卡爾登所映的［五重血案］，雖然也是一部偵探巨片，但是比［福爾摩斯探案］尤爲驚險，而且和［科學怪人］一樣的令人恐怖萬狀，慘不容睹。</p>
<p>劇情略述一輛臥車裏，連續地發生了五重離奇的命案，令人如墮五里霧中，不易捉摸，後來還是靠着小小香烟的一點線索，由新聞記者和警察查明一一破獲。</p>
<p>［五重血案］的導演的確很聰明，他把演員在劇情上都能指揮如意，談到演員方面，當然要推資格最老的彭里昻，劇情本來是恐怖緊張，動人心弦·現在加上彭里昻老到的表演，使［五重血案］生色不少，至於配角方面，白蓓蘭蕙格絲倒很可取，使彭里昻能夠儘量的發展他底偉大的天才。</p>
<p>收音和對白都很明晰佈景可算是全劇的精華，演到在風馳電掣的火車中，殺人血案層見疊出時，確使觀衆的弦隨着劇中人的心神而緊張震盪。</p>
<p>［冤家喜相逢］，是一部烏發出品的法語對白歌艶情片，它的法文名稱呌Ｌevainqueur。女主角凱娣馮鼐芝折藝術，我們在一霓裳仙子］一片中，已經認識她了。圖爲該片的一幕，不日就要在南就大戲院公映了。</p>
<h3>紫羅蘭將來滬</h3>
<p>— 霞</p>
<p>紫羅蘭女士，本是香港的一顆很有名的歌舞明星。她給我們在銀幕上的表演，只有聯華兩片，一張是［銀漢雙星，］還有張是［海外鵑魂。］當時，曾在各報附刋得到佳評。但後來就没有作品了。</p>
<p>頃接粤地某君來函，悉紫返粤後，卽和該地龍某結婚。最近龍又與某姓女相識，而置紫於不顧。雖經紫百般勸導，可是龍總是執迷不醒。近且一言不合，輒卽動武。紫不堪其虐，乃延律師向法院起訴，要求離異。今法院已判决淮如所請云，紫曾語人，將至滬重作銀幕生活云。</p>
<h3>華納公司之鉅片</h3>
<p>— 溶</p>
<p>［第四十二街］</p>
<p>［第四十二街］（４２ndStreet），是華納兄弟公司在攝製中一張新片。内容完全係描寫關於電影界的内幕，和許多電影界人物的縮形。導演由已經去世的佛蘭克倍根之子勞德所擔任。</p>
<p>華納公司本來擬定該片中的演員，以全部人材來參與。如華倫威廉，琪恩白浪蒂，喬治郣令德，凱佛蘭茜，迪克寳威，及佛蘭麥克海等九人，均在預定之列，但因爲有許多的演員在攝製時略有抵觸，故不得不以他人代替，而從福克斯公司借來了華納裴克德，來代替華倫威廉，又以琵琵妲妮兒代替凱佛蘭茜　許多重要的演員旣經决定，而對於歌舞方面的人材也是煞費苦心，在四百多的女子中，祗揀選着一百位美貌的來充任舞女，其中歌唱的明星除了琵琵妲妮兒外，有二位很值得一提，一位是初上鏡頭的羅琵凱鸞（ＲubyＫeeler），是大歌唱家亞爾喬生的妻子。一位是琵絲勃凱蘭（ＢusbyＢerkeley），已在埃第康德的歌舞片中，演過許多次數。</p>
<p>經理華納爲督促努力起見，即將許多舞女召集在一塊訓話，他説：［從明天起我們即開始攝製此片，我們準備要六星期内完成之。］同時他又鼓勵她們，説跳舞要跳到不能舉步纔可以休息。可見此表演認眞之一斑矣。</p>
<h3>介紹［狂流］</h3>
<p>— 蔣青</p>
<p>在過去明星公司所給予我們的認識，雖然已經有許多部燦爛的成功之作，不過就意識和技巧上而論，却也不免有些欠缺。［狂流］是程步高導演比較自認爲得意的新構，並且還是明星劃分時代的作品，怎能不令我們特别的注意呢。</p>
<p>［狂流］是以我國前年長江大火災的事實做背景，表現農民大衆的疾苦。他們艱苦的和滔滔狂流抵抗，和土豪地主的惡勢力搏鬭，夾雜些男女戀愛的Ｓtory</p>
<p>導演的技巧，是很值得稱道的。鏡頭運用之靈活，也很可以贊美。女主角的胡蝶，非常賣力，龔稼農夏偑珍也還適合個性。</p>
<p>置景一方面，如一幕幾百個臨時演員，在大水中搶着築堤，雖是人工的搭景，恐怕和眞的也相差無幾。此外，如大水的一片汪洋，都是很難得的眞景。</p>
<p>綜而言之，這［狂流］在國産片中是很少見的佳作，實在明星公司出的作風改變了。</p>
<h3>看了明月歌劇社後</h3>
<p>— 開秀</p>
<p>肯月歌劇社自在北京戲院表演以來，頗爲觀衆讚賞。所以我也認爲有去賞識賞識的必要　　王人美女士本來自［野玟瑰］一片問世後，早已以歌聲表情的特色膾炙人口，現在已是親臨舞台表演更是神妙了。黎莉莉女士本來是體格健美，表情深刻的一顆明星，所以在［新婚之夜］中由珠喉裏瀝出［休息五分鐘］一曲尤爲動聽。英茵的獨唱，表情倒也不錯，却嫌這條［夜花園裏］的歌曲太平衡，無從發揮她尖悦的歌聲。胡笳丨丨等的合舞整齊可觀。至於唱的方面也很好，尤其是在［野玟瑰］劇中，那位任婢角的小姑娘，實在唱得不亞於王黎二位的。音樂雖是簡單，然光是鋼琴和提琴合奏的，由他們純熟的技藝倒也很和諧幽韻，博得觀衆的好評。</p>
<p>總之這次我看了明月歌劇社後，得了個很好的印象，同時在文化幼稚的中國來説，歌舞能有這樣的進步，的確前途是很有希望的。（酬欵移助東北義勇軍）</p>

<h3>街艶獵記Ｗalking　ＤownＢroadway（九）</h3>
<p>— 毓青</p>
<p>一回兒密麗和孟娜進來，看見潘琪昏昏沉沉的睡在床上，曉得潘琪一定受人家欺侮了。密麗心裏明白，自已對不住潘琪之處。孟娜是一個女中好漢。她趕緊跑到詹梅和馬克同住的房裏，和詹梅説［你欺係那可憐的女孩子，我可不答應。你須拿出錢來養活她。］馬在克旁邊聽了大笑起來了他對詹梅説［我不是同你説過的？這班女人不是好惹的。你還説潘琪不要你的錢呢。］馬克話未説完，給孟娜一拳打在臉上，打的他發昏。她説［渾賬，這都是你幹的好事，你可留心些。要是他不拿出錢來，我問你。你祗可哄哄那傻瓜，我可不拿你當什麽了不起的東西。］她説完就走了。</p>
<p>一回兒，密麗又趕了來。馬克對詹梅説［是不是？她們一個的來了。］可是密麗比較起來，是很容易打發的。她看見了詹梅，承認她昨日所説的，完全係謊話，潘琪完全是一個好人。馬克不等她再往下説：就將她抱了起來，向房門外一推。密麗在房門外嚷者閙著，詹梅和馬克都不理她，她閙了一回也就去了。</p>
<p>密麗走了，馬克拍着詹梅的肩膀，勸他不要因爲不值得的女人生氣。他説［今天是聖誕之夜，我們應當去享樂一下。］詹梅起初一味不肯去，後來被馬克替他帶上帽子，替他穿上大衣，將他連推帶拉地攆了出去。詹梅亦無可無不可地和馬克出去了。可是在半道上，詹梅看見馬克許多不三不四的朋友，很看不起馬克，並且發現了馬克欺騙朋友之事，所以詹梅就和馬克分手，想獨自一個回家。</p>
<p>詹梅在道上獨自一人，　回寓所。路過潘琪房子的前面，頗有依依不捨之意，他仰望着潘琪的窗戶，想像她亦必獨自一個人悶坐在房裏，度她的孤寂的聖誕之夜，忽然聽見潘琪住的房子裏轟然鉅響，忽然一陣黑烟，火光直向屋頂冲出。什麽東西爆炸了，火起了。詹梅起先還倚在房子前面的街燈柱上痴想，爆炸震動了街燈鐵柱，將詹梅驚醒了。　詹梅奮不顧身地向那樓上奔去。以後的事情，他就不記憶了。（未完）</p>

<p>Tang Yulin Telegraphed That the Great War Has Begun</p>
<p>Hoping That People Across the Country Will Rise Up to Support Us</p>
<p>The Enemy's Plan to Attack Kailu Has Failed and They Are Turning to Attack Beipiao,</p>
<p>Fierce Fighting on the Nanling Front, Our Army Resisting with All Its Might</p>
<p>Rehe's Tang Yulin's Circular Telegram says, All Newspaper Offices Please Note: Since</p>
<p>The end of January, the enemy has used a combined land and air force to repeatedly attempt to open up [the path], but fortunately our army and soldiers have obeyed orders, met them head-on with a fierce attack, and have not succeeded. Having lost in Kailu, and suffering a deep, serious pain, the enemy has changed its attack plan and is turning to attack Beipiao. Because the situation in the Beipiao and Chaoyang area is becoming increasingly tense, at 10:00 AM on the 20th, one enemy plane flew to Yebaishou in Jianping, dropping four bombs, killing three merchants and destroying several houses. At 3:00 PM, one enemy plane flew to Beipiao, dropping five bombs, killing seven horses from Dong Brigade's transport unit and one civilian woman. Then, five bombs were dropped on the Nanling position, fortunately without damage. At 6:00 AM on the 21st, the enemy's infantry and artillery, allied with seven armored vehicles, four tanks, and four planes, launched a fierce assault on our Dong Brigade's Nanling position. At the same time, a flanking attack was launched against our Mangniu Yingzi position, and Zhang's battalion of our 214th Regiment in Nanling, and Wang's battalion of our 213th Regiment, which was moving forward to take over the defense of Nanling, were engaged in fierce fighting. By noon on the 21st, the enemy force had increased to over 3,000, with many artillery pieces. Our army is resisting with all its might from the positions near Koubei Yingzi. Upon investigation, the enemy in Jinzhou and Yixian has a very large main force, and there is indeed an attempt to launch a general offensive on Rehe, which is definitely not a local conflict. Now that the great war has already begun, Yulin has wrongly been entrusted with responsibility for the territory and has a responsibility to defend the land, and pledges to coexist with the country's territory. In addition to strictly supervising our troops and fighting to the death, we also hope that people across the country will rise up to support us, hoping for a spiritual response to remotely strengthen our military might, and also hoping for material assistance to encourage our morale. The decisive opportunity for victory depends on the strength of the masses, and the defense against foreign insults depends especially on unity of mind. Respectfully submitting our sincere feelings and awaiting clear instructions, this telegram cannot express the utmost anticipation, Tang Yulin respectfully bows. (22nd Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Beiping) A telegram from Qinhuangdao stated that after the outbreak of the war in Rehe, the situation in Yuguan has suddenly become tense. Last night, several vehicles in Shahezhai made contact with the army. The front line in Shihe is extremely dangerous. The enemy at Lijia Fort is again attacking our army's position east of Jiukou. After about an hour of intense fighting, the enemy retreated. Three Japanese torpedo boats also sailed from Huludao. The situation in Qinhuangdao is tense. Over a thousand Japanese infantry and artillery soldiers were deployed from Jinzhou to Yuguan yesterday. It is rumored that the Japanese will launch a general offensive to the east at the same time, with a full-scale war likely to occur around the 25th of this month. (22nd Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>An Interview with Zhu Jiqing</p>
<h3>On the Morning of February 9th, a Rehe Reporter Followed the</h3>
<p>Adjutant Xu Ronggui of the Commander-in-Chief Headquarters of the Northeast National Salvation Army, departed from Tianjin, took the route through Changli, exited the Jielingkou Pass, and arrived at the headquarters of the Commander-in-Chief of the National Salvation Army after passing through Du Yueqian Gou, Lingnan, and Liujiazi. From Tianjin to here, it took a total of nine days. Whenever he ate and lodged along the way, whenever people mentioned Commander-in-Chief Zhu of the National Salvation Army or personnel of the headquarters, none did not express respect. Even when encountering important armed figures (so-called bandits), the word "National Salvation Army" was mentioned, there was no obstruction, and they were even repeatedly told that if they encountered people like us in the future, they could say that they were friends from Zhanbei or Pingdong, so as to avoid misunderstandings. At first, he did not know what Zhanbei or Pingdong meant, and after inquiring with Adjutant Xu, he learned that they were nicknames for their leaders (another name for Green Forest leaders), and the so-called Lao Beifeng and Xiao Bailong were also such leaders. After passing Liujiazi, it was still far to the headquarters. Each time he passed a village association, the militia would send one or two armed militiamen to escort him directly to the headquarters before returning. The army's popularity with the people was such that it was truly a new era of military-civilian harmony in China. Along the way, most of the armies leaving the Pass were still stalled halfway, and it was unknown what their plans were. The reporter arrived at the headquarters at 1:00 PM on the 18th of this month and was immediately greeted by the adjutant on duty, who was extremely humble. After resting for a short time in the reception room, he immediately submitted his name card for an audience and was granted an audience. He was led into the commander-in-chief's office by the officer of the day. The four walls were covered with maps, and a small clock was placed on the desk, along with piles of documents. Apart from pens and inkstones, there was nothing else, which was extremely simple and orderly. When the reporter entered the room, Zhu was buried in reading documents. He then put down his pen and shook hands with the reporter as a courtesy. Zhu was wearing a blue cloth-faced leather robe, and the color was already very old. His face was slightly thinner than when he was in Tianjin, but his spirit was very radiant. After exchanging brief pleasantries with the reporter, he immediately arranged for a detailed discussion in the evening, because many representatives of volunteer armies from various places were visiting during the day to report, and he could not have a long conversation. At 9:00 PM, he was again summoned. Zhu's remarks were as follows:</p>
<p>"Sir (referring to the reporter), in this autumn of ice and snow, you have not hesitated to travel here through hardships and cold. I am very welcome and admire you. Since the fall of the Northeast, many of the front-line news reported in the newspapers of Tianjin, Beijing, and Shanghai do not correspond to the facts. As one who lives outside the Pass, I also feel somewhat isolated from the progress of the situation in the interior. If the gentlemen of the press could have more of your spirit, conduct on-the-spot investigations to verify the facts, record the military situation outside the Pass, and introduce it to the interior, and introduce the political situation in the interior to the outside of the Pass, it would be of no small benefit to the work of national salvation." The reporter asked, "What is your opinion on the judgment of the Japanese traitor Muto, who declared that he would occupy Rehe in the shortest possible time and threaten Tianjin and Beijing?" Zhu replied, "The attempt to occupy Rehe has been a consistent policy of Japan for many years, and there is no doubt about it. But how easy is it to implement the occupation in a short time?" He asked, "What is your opinion on Matsuoka's statement that if his demands are not met, he will withdraw from the League of Nations, and Araki's must to maintain the puppet state?" He replied, "I am afraid it will be difficult to do so." He asked, "What is the determination of your army in the future?" He replied, "Our army is purely driven by national consciousness. For the sake of national survival, we will do our best to fulfill our responsibility as commoners. Success or failure, gain or loss, are not considered. Even if there is only one soldier left, we will fight to the end with the violent Japanese." He asked, "How many soldiers does your army have?" He replied, "As of now, it has increased more than twice as much as when we attacked Jinzhou and Yixian last year." He asked, "Is it true that there are only about a hundred people under your command, as rumored outside?" He replied, "That is a great absurdity. There are currently infantry, cavalry, artillery, and personnel from various departments of the headquarters who live with me, which is certainly more than a hundred people. If you say that there were only a hundred people last year, how could we have fought at the same time in Jin County, Yixian County, and Chaoyang Temple? If you say now, as evidenced by the reports from Chairman Tang and Chaoyang County Chief Li Zhizhen to Beiping on the 17th of this month, our army fought fiercely with the Japanese army in Chaoyang Temple. If there were really only a hundred people, how could we have fought with the Japanese at Chaoyang Temple, which is more than 200 li away from the location of the headquarters? I heard that there are rumors outside that you and the residents of the stationed area are not on good terms. Is that true?" He replied, "More than 20% of the residents within 30 to 40 li of the area followed me in battle last year. The village associations, residents, and Green Foresters in the vicinity have all expressed their unconditional support for me. You must believe that my words are not wrong based on what you have seen and heard along the way." Zhu continued, "Since I left the Pass in the spring of last year, rumors have been rife. By the time I left the Pass for the second time, the rumors were even worse. Some said that the ammunition and weapons I transported were robbed midway, and others said that I was wanted by a certain party for a reward. When I attacked Jinzhou and Yixian, some said that I was captured and the entire army collapsed. There were even those who said that I was blackmailed by bandits for 20,000 yuan. There are so many such things that I cannot list them all. Whether they are conscious or unconscious, whether they have any effect or not, I have not paid attention to them. However, colleagues from all sides have repeatedly sent letters and telegrams to inquire, and Director Zhang and Chairman Tang have issued protection orders before and after. Mr. Ziqiao also expressed deep concern when he heard that I had been blackmailed by the long. I am deeply uneasy," he said sincerely until 11:00 PM. (Beiping) A telegram from Qinhuangdao stated that the enemy army in Yuguan has sent personnel to requisition vehicles everywhere and is using heavy trucks to transport bulky goods out of the Pass. Three enemy armored vehicles are stationed at Yuguan Station and departed for the Pass on the evening of the 21st. One enemy aircraft flew from the east on the morning of the 21st, circled several times, and landed near the Fourth Battery.

<p>After the Restoration of Diplomatic Relations Between China and Russia</p>
<p>Japanese Goods Were Severely Affected</p>
<p>(Nanjing) A recent investigation by the Ministry of Industry found that since the restoration of diplomatic relations between China and Russia, Sino-Japanese trade has suffered a major blow. In areas such as North China, Japan has been particularly hard hit. According to last month's report from the Tianjin Customs, Japanese imports of cloth and cotton yarn into China have plummeted, while Russian goods have shown a rapid increase. The amount of imports is extremely alarming. (22nd Special Dispatch)</p>

During the banquet, Zhang replied to Shaw's inquiries, saying that a Japanese invasion of Rehe seemed unavoidable. The Japanese warlords are barbaric, and the world recognizes that, in addition to military self-defense, it is difficult to find other ways to resolve the problem. The Japanese warlords only know how to invade others and never reason. Then they talked about the Chinese communist problem. Shaw said that the communist government must also pay attention to order. If there are communists who disrupt social order under the communist government, they should also be severely punished. (22nd Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Current Affairs Commentary</h3>
<p>Speculation on Japan's Withdrawal from the League of Nations</p>
<p>(I) Japan's Erroneous Views on the Current International Situation</p>
<p>Taking advantage of the extreme global economic panic and the eagerness of European and American countries to save themselves, Japan, citing special interests and the prevention of communism, has constantly seized Liaoning and Jilin, extended to Northern Manchuria, and encroached upon Jinzhou and Yixian, all while the United Kingdom and France initially only partially listened to Japan's deceptive rhetoric. Our country merely offered empty words of resistance without ever actually using military force. Thus, reason and justice existed, but facts remained facts.</p>
<p>On the first day of this year, the year of the Lugouqiao Incident, it seemed that the defending generals had abandoned their past policy of [non-resistance] and were engaging in fierce fighting. The nations gradually became aware of the aggressive ambitions of Japanese imperialism and its attempts to monopolize the Chinese market. Therefore, the Nineteen-Nation Committee drafted a report invoking Article 15, Paragraph 4 of the Covenant regarding the Sino-Japanese dispute. Although this matter has not yet been passed by the League of Nations General Assembly, even if it is, the actual effectiveness of its implementation remains to be seen. However, the international community's expression of respect for the Covenant to Japan is generally apparent. On the other hand, the Japanese militarists' observation of the current world situation differs greatly from that of ordinary people.</p>
<p>[First,] Japan believes that the League of Nations has absolutely no real power and can only, at most, initiate reconciliation and end with advice, because it believes that the capitalist countries have different concepts of self-interest, and how can the League of Nations, under the direction of Britain and France, interfere in the Far East and intervene with Japan, which possesses a powerful navy and army.</p>
<p>Second, even if the recommendation is adopted, Japan, as one of the parties involved, can simply ignore it. Since Britain and France have different actual interests, it is impossible to invoke Article 16 of the Covenant to impose an economic blockade on Japan. Third, based on the experience of the past year and a half and the lessons of its history, China is in a state of endless internal strife, [brave in private, timid in public,] which has almost become a national habit, and resistance is merely [empty words]. Fourth, the situation of [opposition between the United States and Britain has not diminished. The war debt problem is their current cancer. Moreover, market competition and investment rivalry both have the nature of inevitable conflict.]</p>
<p>Japan sees all four of the above as points of advantage. In particular, it considers the opposition between the United States and Britain and the weakness of China as excellent opportunities for Japan to carry out aggression. Therefore, as soon as the League of Nations shows a slight inclination towards justice, Japan will roar loudly, advocate withdrawing from the League of Nations, begin using force freely, and launch a large-scale invasion of Rehe.</p>
<p>(II) The Difficulties Japan Faces After Withdrawing from the League of Nations</p>
<p>Since Japanese imperialism has already indulged in its violence and disregarded everything, once it withdraws from the League of Nations, it will inevitably become even more barbaric in annexing the three northeastern provinces. Besides forcibly occupying Shanhaiguan, it may even attack Qian'an and Luan County, or even bomb Tianjin and Beijing. If this happens, what will our country do? What will the countries of the world do? And what will Japan do?</p>
<p>First, our country can hardly endure this any longer and cannot possibly seek peace even if it forces itself to compromise. Moreover, since Japan has withdrawn from the League of Nations, not only is there [no reason to talk], but there will also be nowhere and no way to talk. From now on, we can only mobilize our vast masses for a desperate struggle to find a way out for the nation. Japan stakes its entire national strength to [turn all of Japan into scorched earth to keep Manchuria], while we [mobilize the red blood of our entire nation of 400 million people and use all the wealth we possess to vow to recover the three northeastern provinces]. This war may last fifty or one hundred years. If the war truly begins, then small issues such as boycotting Japanese goods will naturally be resolved. Japan will not only have its trade with China completely wiped out, but its trade with Europe and the United States will also be greatly affected.</p>
<p>Second, if the international community passes a resolution of recommendation, moral sanction will follow. Although Article 16 of the Covenant may not be implemented immediately, if the Sino-Japanese war truly begins, then the United Kingdom, the United States, and France, in order to safeguard their own interests and maintain their existing markets in China, will inevitably have to cooperate in [economically blockading] Japan, which may become one of the means against Japan.</p>
<p>Third, the global economic panic is becoming increasingly serious. The measures currently used by capitalist countries to overcome the economic panic have limited effect. Taking Japan as an example, since the implementation of the suspension of the gold standard and the adoption of inflationary policies, there seems to be a temporary good market. However, for more than a month this year, raw silk, cotton yarn, and other products have gradually declined, showing signs of returning to the [economic depression] of last summer. If war breaks out and military expenses suddenly increase, the general purchasing power of the country will shrink even further, and the overseas market will likely be lost. Its impact on the world economy will be very serious, and Japanese imperialists will find it even more difficult to avoid collapse.</p>
<p>Fourth, everyone knows how dangerous the general social situation in Japan is. Its warlords deliberately exaggerate it in order to use military power to control politics and fundamentally overthrow its so-called constitutional government. If it continues to blindly and stubbornly monopolize China, then the exhaustion of its national power will be ten or a hundred times greater than it is today.</p>
<p>At this critical moment, how can our people willingly sit idly by and be slaughtered? Although the three northeastern provinces have now fallen into the hands of the enemy, the Northeast is indeed a powerful powder keg. If our people can vow to fight to the death and never fear defeat, then final victory will surely come to our country.</p>
<p>The League of Nations General Assembly Tomorrow</p>
<p>Voting on the Report</p>
<p>Representatives of Both Parties Will Speak</p>
<p>The Rehe Issue Will Also Be Discussed</p>
<p>(Geneva) According to a staff member of the League of Nations Secretariat, after the League of Nations General Assembly opens on Friday morning, unless the Japanese representative Matsuoka insists on speaking before the vote on the report and recommendations drafted by the Nineteen-Nation Committee, according to the current plan, Chairman Hymans will make a brief explanation, and then immediately hold a vote on the report and recommendations. Then, Japanese representative Matsuoka will be given the opportunity to explain the reasons for his opposition, and the Chinese representative Yan Huqing will be given the opportunity to declare his acceptance. After both parties have explained, the League of Nations General Assembly will proceed to vote on the proposal to authorize the Nineteen-Nation Committee to observe the incident and consult with the United States and Russia to consider the League of Nations' second step. It is expected that this proposal will also be passed. After that, it is expected that the Chinese representative Yan Huqing will raise the issue of the Rehe situation and ask the League of Nations what to do. Once this issue is raised, it is expected that it will be discussed at the meeting, and the League of Nations General Assembly will be forced to convene again on Saturday. It has now been officially announced that the meeting of the Nineteen-Nation Committee tomorrow morning will be changed to 5:15 PM. (National Telegram on the 22nd)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The League of Nations General Assembly is scheduled to reconvene on the morning of the 24th. In addition to the speeches by the Chinese and Japanese representatives, most of the other representatives will not speak to show the unity of the whole. It is expected that the draft report will be passed on that day. If time does not permit, it will definitely be passed by the 25th at the latest. (Central News Agency Telegram on the 22nd)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations has paid close attention after receiving a telegram from the Northeast and Rehe Support Association in Beiping. However, it believes that since the Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations have not been severed, it is not appropriate for the Chinese side to invoke Article 16 of the Covenant. (Central News Agency Telegram on the 22nd)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Nineteen-Nation Committee continued its meeting on the 21st after the General Assembly. Secretary-General Drummond made a brief report on which member states were willing to join and which were unwilling to join the future negotiation committee. The issue of whether to send letters of invitation to Russia and the United States was also studied. It was generally agreed that since the Russian and American governments had been informed of the final judgment of the Nineteen-Nation Special Committee's proposal, and the League of Nations General Assembly's hope that Russia and the United States could endorse the opinions in the report and act in concert with the member states of the League of Nations when necessary, the requirements of this situation had been fully included in this letter. The committee also exchanged views on the situation in Rehe, and the procedures for the General Assembly on Friday were also discussed. (Central News Agency Telegram on the 22nd)</p>
<p>Special Committee</p>
<p>Meeting Situation the Day Before Yesterday</p>
<p>Proceeding with the Organization of the Negotiation Committee</p>
<p>Nineteen Countries Have Accepted the Invitation</p>
<p>(Geneva) After discussing the organization of the negotiation committee on the evening of the 21st, the Nineteen-Nation Special Committee considered whether the League of Nations General Assembly should continue to meet after the report was passed. The meeting approved that the League of Nations General Assembly should continue to meet. Another issue discussed by the meeting was what measures China should take to raise the Rehe issue. This matter will be studied again on Thursday. It has been temporarily decided that there will be no discussion on the report on Friday, but the final decision on the procedures must be passed on Thursday. The Swiss representative is very willing to deliver a long speech to express regret over the changes in the Far East dispute, but the meeting strongly urged him not to do so. Some sources reported tonight that British Foreign Secretary Simon will come to Geneva to make a final plea for mediation, but this statement has not been confirmed. It is certainly possible that representatives of other countries will speak on Friday. It is generally believed that the two meetings of the League of Nations General Assembly on Friday will be able to complete the discussion of the report. If so, the report should be passed that evening. Article 15 of the League of Nations Covenant clearly stipulates that the report can be passed by a majority vote other than the two parties, so the passage of this report will not raise the question of legality. (Reuters Telegram on the 21st)</p>
<p>Issuing a Communiqué After the Nineteen-Nation Committee Met, the Following Communiqué Was Immediately Issued:</p>
<p>The Secretary-General of the League of Nations, in accordance with the instructions of the Nineteen-Nation Committee, explained to the various countries that a negotiation committee should be organized in accordance with the report submitted by the Nineteen-Nation Committee to the Extraordinary General Assembly. After the issue of whether the various countries intended to participate in this committee was raised, the following countries stated that they were willing to participate in the negotiation committee: Germany, Italy, Belgium, the United Kingdom, France, Spain, Ireland, the Netherlands, Portugal, Czechoslovakia, Turkey, Colombia, Guatemala, Hungary, Mexico, Norway, Panama, Sweden, and Switzerland. Poland's reply has not yet arrived. The Secretary-General also declared that the signatory countries of the Washington Nine-Power Treaty include Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the Union of South Africa, and India. It is not known whether the various governments have considered this point. He believes that the Nineteen-Nation Committee should pay attention to this point in order to issue invitations to these member states to invite them to participate in the work of the negotiation committee. After being mentioned by the Secretary-General, the Nineteen-Nation Committee believed that these invitations should be issued and ordered the Secretary-General to do so. The Nineteen-Nation Committee then studied some points of the program for the Extraordinary General Assembly on Friday and briefly exchanged views on the news of the Rehe situation. The Extraordinary General Assembly is scheduled to open at 10:00 AM on Friday, and the Nineteen-Nation Committee will hold another meeting on Thursday afternoon before the Extraordinary General Assembly opens.

<p>Response to the League of Nations Report</p>
<p>Japan Submits a Rebuttal</p>
<p>The Content is Divided into Ten Points, the Language is Extremely Absurd</p>
<p>Saying That the Japanese Government is Not Responsible for the Incidents After September 18th</p>
<p>Deciding to Maintain the Pseudo-State, Fundamentally Overthrowing the Lytton Ten Principles</p>
<p>Opposing Troop Withdrawal and US and Russian Participation in the Negotiation Committee</p>
<p>(Geneva) Japan's reply to the Nineteen-Nation Special Committee was released today, containing ten points. (1) The reply stated that most of the descriptions of facts in the report cannot be accepted by Japan, but it is also useless to debate these facts. (2) Japan did not want to see Manchuria secede from Chinese sovereignty, but the League of Nations is responsible for some of the incidents that occurred after September 18, 1931, because in the early stages of the dispute, the League of Nations hastily rebuked Japan and gathered Western opinions that were unfavorable to Japan. (3) The Japanese military actions in Manchuria were a self-defense plan forced by the Chinese situation. (4) Japan is convinced that if the principles of the League of Nations Covenant, the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and the Nine-Power Treaty are not applied according to the actual situation of the times, the fundamental solution to this problem cannot be realized. (5) The government of [Manchukuo] has made steady progress, and there is only organized opposition within Rehe. (6) Bandits and Zhang Xueliang's troops, encouraged by the attitude of the League of Nations, are now concentrating their forces. Japan is bound by the treaty to ensure the safety of [Manchukuo] and cannot remain silent. (7) The ten principles of resolution proposed by the Lytton Report and endorsed by the Nineteen-Nation Special Committee cannot be implemented in nine out of ten cases unless China has a strong central government. The proposal to withdraw Japanese troops in Manchuria to the South Manchuria Railway area seems to think that the security of [Manchukuo] can be maintained by local military police. This statement is absurd and unfeasible. Japan still maintains its position on the negotiation committee's allowing Russia and the United States to participate and opposes the League of Nations' proposal. If it wants to bind member states and non-member states to not recognize another country, the League of Nations is acting beyond its powers. (8) The report of the Nineteen-Nation Special Committee encourages China to reject peace talks and avoid resolution. (9) Japan is responsible for maintaining peace in the Far East and is prepared to cooperate with any friendly country to achieve this goal. (10) The reply stressed the complexity of the situation in the Far East and said that this situation has existed for a short time, so even the Lytton Commission could not explain it. Therefore, Japan requests the League of Nations General Assembly to think again before making a decision. (Reuters Telegram on the 21st) The United States Will Soon</p>
<p>Have a Concrete Expression</p>
<p>(Geneva) League of Nations leaders indicated that they may not be able to receive a formal or informal expression of the United States' attitude before the League of Nations General Assembly votes on the report proposed by the Nineteen-Nation Committee. However, it is believed here that the news in the Washington newspapers has fully expressed the US government's satisfaction with the report, and some aspects feel that the US State Department's insistence on not commenting before the League of Nations General Assembly votes is a concrete expression that the United States will soon formally join the cooperation after the League of Nations General Assembly formally passes it.

<p>British Ambassador Visits Japanese Vice Minister</p>
<p>(Tokyo) British Ambassador to Japan Lindley visited Vice Minister Arita at 11:30 this morning and said that he was specially ordered by the British Foreign Secretary to inquire about the true intentions of the Japanese Foreign Ministry. Newspapers are full of reports that the Japanese government has decided to withdraw from the League of Nations. Is this actually the case? Vice Minister Arita said that if the League of Nations General Assembly unconditionally accepts the report of the Nineteen-Nation Committee, Japan will decide to declare its opposition on the spot and withdraw the Japanese representative. As for whether to withdraw, it will be decided after the representative returns to the country. It is not yet time to make a clear statement. This shows that Japan still has lingering attachment to its League of Nations policy. (China United News Agency Telegram on the 22nd) Does Japan Really Have the Determination</p>
<p>To Sever Ties with the League of Nations?</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations side speculated this morning about the development of the Sino-Japanese dispute and the attitude that the League of Nations General Assembly will take when it reconvenes on Friday. Yesterday, the statement issued by the Japanese representative resolutely rejected the report of the Nineteen-Nation Special Committee and refused to stop the military actions in Rehe. Therefore, the public opinion situation is becoming more tense. Although efforts to mediate are still being carried out behind the scenes, there is absolutely no hope of success and there is no way to prevent Japan from breaking with the League of Nations. (National Telegram on the 22nd) (Geneva) Although the Japanese delegation sent a harshly worded reply to the League of Nations Secretariat and the newspapers this afternoon, and the news from Tokyo also indicated Japan's determination to resist the League of Nations and implement its policy of assisting [Manchukuo], Geneva still does not believe that Japan will truly sever relations with the League of Nations and cancel all cooperation, because since Japan joined the organization, it has had all kinds of close and beneficial relationships that cannot be cut off immediately. It is generally felt here that the speech by Hymans, Chairman of the Nineteen-Nation Special Committee, implied that the door is still open and Japan can still propose new suggestions. It is doubtful whether this suggestion will exist, but Japan will not withdraw from the League of Nations unless it is in a desperate situation. Moreover, the Japanese representative will take over as chairman of the next Executive Council meeting, so the public does not believe that Japan is willing to sacrifice this honor and the special rights of being a permanent member of the Executive Council. In this environment, there is no need to speculate on the consequences of Japan's withdrawal from the League of Nations and the various impacts that this move will have on the disarmament conference, the world economic conference, and the work of the League of Nations, or on the issues related to the mandated territories in the Pacific. Therefore, the general public deeply believes that the Japanese government must [think again] before deciding to withdraw from the League of Nations in this event that has serious relations with the country and the international community, as stated in its reply.

<p>British House of Commons</p>
<p>Discussing the Far East Situation</p>
<p>An Arms Embargo is Not Yet the Time</p>
<p>丨Simon Answers Questions from Labor Members丨</p>
<p>(London) British Foreign Secretary Simon made a statement in the House of Commons tonight on the Far East situation. He first stated that he had not yet received confirmed reports of news of fighting in or on the border of Rehe. He said that the Chinese delegation in Geneva had obtained information from the Nanjing central government that Zhang Xueliang was resisting. Simon mentioned the progress of the League of Nations in Geneva, saying that he must wait quietly for the decision of the League of Nations General Assembly. Simon continued to mention the issue of prohibiting the transportation of weapons to the Far East, saying that President Hoover recently wrote to Congress, stating that if one country prohibits it and another country does not, it will not help. It can be seen that this matter involves complex international issues, and he is not convenient to continue commenting on it at this time. Labor leader Lansbury asked whether the British government was prepared to negotiate an arms embargo with the US government and other governments. Simon replied that he could not predict the government's decision, but he believed that this matter should be considered internationally in Geneva. Before the League of Nations General Assembly considers the draft report of the special committee and the various countries express their opinions, it is not only too early to refuse to prevent the transportation of weapons to Japan, but it is also inappropriate. Liberal Party Nasan moved that the House of Commons adjourn because the government refused to immediately take steps to prevent the transportation of weapons to Japan as the war in Rehe gradually developed, but the Speaker rejected this motion.

It said that if public sentiment is not promoted at this opportunity, it is feared that the people will suffer from economic difficulties and internal strife will break out. Therefore, they should take advantage of the withdrawal from the League of Nations to organize propaganda teams to lobby the whole country and awaken public opinion. It is said that it has been decided to form nine lecture groups to lobby 51 major cities across the country within three weeks starting in early next month.

<p>(London) The Times said in an editorial today, "Will the League of Nations General Assembly decide to take further action, or will it merely table the report and then disperse? For the future benefit of the League of Nations, the League of Nations should choose a method that requires less extravagance. To say that the countries that organized the League of Nations are prepared to go to war with Japan in order to prevent the Japanese and Manchu armies from seizing Rehe is simply foolish. The dangerous burdens of applying Article 16 of the League of Nations Covenant will be borne by the major powers, especially the countries that have relations in the Far East. Therefore, these countries must decide which is the most feasible policy to restore peace as soon as possible and to make the two countries accept the League of Nations' solution. However, if they decide to adopt a wait-and-see policy, there is no reason to allow arms to continue to be supplied to the belligerent countries in order to facilitate their hostile actions. US Secretary of State Stimson recently said that if the League of Nations decides that one of the belligerent countries is an aggressor, the United States can also prohibit the export of arms. Upon closer examination, it seems that Japan alone should not have the right to obtain arms supplies, but the practical difficulty is that the arms shipped to China will be intercepted by Japan before they arrive in China. This is indeed a matter that should be discussed by the manufacturing countries of arms and that the opinions of the Chinese government should be sought." (Reuters Telegram on the 22nd)</p>

<h3>Japan Shows No Sincerity in Maintaining Peace; Soviet Russia Expresses Determination to Increase Military Preparedness</h3>
<p>Speech by Military Commissar to Collective Farm Shock Troops</p>
<p>(Moscow) During a meeting of Soviet collective farm shock troops in Moscow, Military Commissar Voroshilov delivered a stirring speech. This speech has now been published in the Soviet newspapers. After discussing the development and organization of Soviet collective farms, as well as issues related to the current spring planting campaign, Voroshilov turned to the current international situation and the issue of strengthening Soviet defense. Voroshilov began by stating an opinion identical to that of Lenin, saying, "[The state belonging to us workers and peasants must not be complacent in its acquired full self-defense capabilities against aggression.]" He emphasized the fact that the Soviet government has always adhered to a steady and open peace policy, with no ambition to conquer others. Voroshilov declared amidst a full house of applause, "[To make the pursuit of peace more stable, we must] seek the strengthening of industry and the development of agriculture. We need a strong army. Our existing army is worthy of this description, well-organized, with modern and precise weaponry, and completely aligned with the steps of workers and peasants and the steps of socialism." Voroshilov continued, "[Our country is deeply gratified to have good diplomatic relations with some of our western neighbors through the mutual signing of non-aggression treaties. The signing of these treaties with Poland and France is especially important. Although our country has a relatively secure international position with our western neighbors, we must continue to pay close attention to the Far East. Certainly, Sino-Soviet relations have recently been restored, and Japanese-Soviet relations are also normal, but we must consider the fact that within Japan's political circles, and especially within Japan's military circles, there are prominent figures who openly declare that Japan has the possibility of going to war with the Soviet Union, and even the necessity of going to war. Our country pursues a policy of peace and non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries in the Far East, just as it does in other regions, a policy of seeking to improve diplomatic relations with all neighboring countries. A year ago, our country proposed to the Japanese government the mutual signing of a non-aggression treaty, and we have reiterated this proposal again and again. There is no shortage of citizens within Japan who desire peace and seek to improve Japanese-Soviet economic and other relations, but the Japanese government clearly disregards the opinions of these citizens, and one-sidedly emphasizes the opinions of imperialists who instigate war. In the end, they rejected our country's proposal. Therefore, we must do our utmost to deal with this unstable situation, especially the need to increase defense on the Far Eastern border.]" Regarding the successes of the Red Army's military equipment and technology, Voroshilov specifically mentioned the contributions of the Communist Party Central Committee and Stalin. Voroshilov said, "[We have long had an excellent army, and in the last four years, we have made rapid progress in modern technological equipment. We are confident that the Red Army's excellent organization and superior technology, coupled with the efforts of workers and peasants and the bravery of soldiers, will make any interventionist attempt impossible," he said.

<h3>Sun Ke's Remarks in Nanjing</h3>
<p>The People Should Prepare to Resist Aggression</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Sun Ke returned to Nanjing on the morning of the 22nd and spoke with reporters about the affairs of the Sun Yat-sen Culture and Education Center. He said that the Central Political Council had already approved a monthly subsidy of 50,000 yuan for the project on the 22nd, and that the founding meeting would be held at the Mausoleum on March 12th. The significance of the center lies in expounding on the Premier's legacy and academic spirit, operating in parallel with various academic organizations, and, depending on the amount of funding and the importance of the project, studying cultural and educational projects that academic organizations are unable to undertake and that are in line with modern times. The proposed projects include: (1) Education, (2) Art History, (3) Social Problems, (4) Land Problems, (5) Premier's Industrial Plan, (6) Premier's Psychological Suggestions, (7) History of Philosophy, (8) Geography, (9) Local Systems, (10) International Problems, (11) Establishment of Libraries and Museums, and (12) Establishment of Sun Yat-sen Scholarships. The initial work includes: (1) Organizing field investigation teams, (2) Establishing scholarships and grants, (3) Commissioning or acquiring and translating books, and (4) Establishing specialized researchers. (Central News Agency dispatch of the 22nd) (Nanjing) Sun Ke told reporters on the 22nd that the Sino-Japanese situation has reached a point of extreme tension. Our only way out is through resistance. After the report was announced, many people in the country felt pleased, but in reality, preparations are insufficient. The League of Nations is not to be relied upon. It is rumored that Japan will blockade our seaports. The people should prepare for a rainy day, ensuring military supplies and civilian food, and making preparations early. Public sentiment is high everywhere, but relying on empty words will not help in reality. It is hoped that planned preparations will be made to resist aggression. I would rather be gloriously defeated in war than seek compromise. With Japan's massive military spending, domestic unrest will inevitably arise in five or ten years, and the empire will collapse as a result. Final victory will certainly belong to us. He then spoke about the constitution and the National Political Council, saying that one should be cautious in all matters in order to set a good example. There is no discussion yet of hiring foreign advisors. Moreover, while Britain and the United States advocate individual freedom, and Soviet Russia advocates class dictatorship, which is extreme nationalism, neither is suitable for our national conditions. Only the Three Principles of the People nurture the spirit of democracy and contain socialism. He then spoke about the draft organizational law and representative election law of the National Political Council, most of which have been completed. As for which system to use for electing representatives, the draft will be sent to the Central Standing Committee for approval and then to the Legislative Yuan for review because the organizations of villages and towns are not yet ready. Finally, he mentioned the Administrative Regulations Review Committee, which was convened by Dai Jitao, but has not yet met. However, the regulations of various agencies are extremely inconsistent, but this matter has less to do with the Legislative Yuan. (Central News Agency dispatch of the 22nd)</p>
<h3>External Affairs Ministry Denies</h3>

<p>(Nanjing) Reports that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has recalled its ambassador to Japan are incorrect.

<h3>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs Resolves Not to Accept the Absurd Ultimatum of the Puppet Regime</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Foreign news reports that the puppet organization will deliver a final ultimatum to our government on the 22nd, demanding the withdrawal of troops stationed in Rehe within a time limit, otherwise it will be resolved by force. According to the reporter's investigation, as of the afternoon of the 22nd, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had not yet received this absurd ultimatum, but we have decided not to accept this ultimatum. If the puppets and Japanese invaders invade Rehe, we will resolutely deal them a head-on blow. (Central News Agency dispatch of the 22nd)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Foreign news reports that the Japanese government will issue a proposal to us on the 22nd, demanding the withdrawal of the Rehe troops and the establishment of a neutral zone inside and outside the Great Wall. The government has not received this absurd document. According to a government spokesman, Rehe is our territory, and we have the right to station any troops there, which is not for others to comment on. If the Japanese army invades us, we will thoroughly resist. As for the neutral zone, it is a great insult to us and intends to sow discord. At a time when the whole country is united to resist the enemy, how can there be a reason for fighting in one place and neutrality in another? Moreover, the Eastern Provinces are our territory, and although Japan has occupied them by force, we are determined to recover them. How can a neutral zone be established inside and outside the Great Wall? Therefore, if Japan sends such an absurd document, we will resolutely reject it. (Central News Agency dispatch of the 22nd)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) As of this afternoon, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has not received the so-called "Manchukuo" ultimatum. According to a spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, it would be ridiculous if "Manchukuo" were to send a final ultimatum to the Chinese government. If the ultimatum is delivered, the Chinese government will refuse to accept it and will return it in the same way as it returned Xie Jieshi's ultimatum last year. (Reuters dispatch of the 22nd)</p>

<p>Facing Enemy Invasion, We Shall Fight to the Death, Other Considerations are Secondary</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, Song Ziwen, the Acting Premier and Minister of Finance of the Executive Yuan, recognizing the severity of the situation in North China, traveled north on the 10th of this month to meet with North China authorities to discuss important matters and to devise financial solutions. Subsequently, due to the tense situation in Jehol, he, along with Zhang Xueliang and others, went to express their support. He returned to Shanghai via Pingjin (Beiping and Tianjin) by train the day before yesterday. Yesterday morning at 10 a.m. at his private residence on Qiqi Road, he met with reporters from various newspapers to report on his trip to North China and the future situation regarding resistance against Japan. Here is a record of his remarks, dispelling rumors worthy of scorn. According to Song, before he left Shanghai for the north, he repeatedly heard rumors from various sources that Jehol generals had already reached an understanding with the Japanese puppet authorities. The embassy even questioned him about this. These rumors were not worth a knowing smile. He recalled that during the January 28th Incident last year, the Japanese side had also repeatedly fabricated rumors, hoping to sow discord. Now they were employing the same old trick. After he arrived in Pingjin, what he heard and saw quickly confirmed that the rumors were groundless, without any need for investigation.</p>
<p>Regarding Military Expenses: After arriving in Pingjin, he immediately discussed the financial problems of North China with the financial community of Pingjin and achieved substantial results. It was decided to issue 20 million yuan in National Salvation Bonds. The issuance of these bonds has been approved by the central government and will be issued soon. The details of the issuance will be announced later. As for the planning of military expenses in North China, arrangements have been made for the months of March, April, and May. Plans will continue to be made to ensure that the soldiers have no worries about starvation. The generals and officers in North China are extremely indignant about the Japanese invasion and are determined to fight to the death. They only ask for enough food and have no other requests. Even when the troops are deployed, they have no expectations. The people of North China are sincere and enthusiastic. Some say that the people of the north are slow and serious and less patriotic than the people of the south. Now it can be proven that this is not true. The patriotism of the northern people is no less than that of the southern people.</p>
<p>Unification of Organizations: There are many patriotic organizations among the people in various parts of North China, but they lack coordination and centralized strength. Because there are many organizations but no coordination, those who donate funds often do not know where to go. This point must be reformed immediately. Therefore, he had gathered with celebrities from all walks of life in Pingjin and representatives from Shanghai local associations, Huang Renzhi, Du Chongyuan, Mu Ouchu, Yang Zhixiong, etc., to discuss a unified organization. It has been decided to organize the [Northeast Jehol Relief Association]. With the enthusiastic participation of all circles and centralized organization, it will definitely obtain extremely effective assistance.</p>
<p>Wartime Propaganda: Resistance against the enemy is the biggest event facing the whole country right now. We should make the people of the whole country understand the reasons for the war. Wartime propaganda is especially important. He, recognizing this, has discussed the organization of wartime propaganda with the school authorities in Pingjin. It has also been decided to organize the [Central Wartime Propaganda Team] to go to the front lines to spread propaganda, so that armed soldiers and local people all know about the atrocities of the Japanese invasion and our responsibility to defend the country. At the same time, it should make the people of North China understand that the central government is determined to resist Japan. The wartime propagandists are all students, regardless of gender, in order to boost the morale of the front lines. The morale of the people in North China is currently very high, which is truly gratifying.</p>
<p>Only Fight to the Death: The central government and Chairman Chiang's attitude toward resisting Japan are extremely resolute. There are rumors that Japan will be reckless to the end after withdrawing from the League of Nations, and if they cannot conquer Jehol, they will surely disrupt Pingjin and the coastal areas along the Yangtze River. He is not considering this matter at the moment. He only knows that the central government and Chairman Chiang are determined to fight to the death when the enemy comes, and other considerations are secondary. When Song said this, his voice and expression were stern, and a kind of激昂 attitude was fully revealed in his words.</p>

<p>Unified Organization: According to the Central News Agency,</p>
<p>He Jingwu, Chairman of the Pinghan Railway</p>
<p>Management Committee, established the National Air Force Founding Association. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek greatly appreciated this matter, but because the names of aviation national salvation organizations in various places were not unified, he ordered him to consult with Wu Tiecheng, the Mayor of Shanghai, to find a way to unify the names of national civil aviation national salvation movement organizations. A Central News Agency reporter visited Mayor Wu at the municipal government yesterday to inquire about the method of unifying aviation national salvation organizations. According to Mayor Wu, at present, the people in various parts of the country feel the necessity of aviation equipment, and have successively established aviation national salvation organizations, and the intentions are very good, but if a unified organization is not sought immediately, then each will seek its own way, and the power will be scattered. A good result must not be produced. Chiang Kai-shek was aware of this, so he ordered the unification of the names and organizations of national civil aviation national salvation organizations across the country. It has now been decided to establish branches and sub-branches throughout the country under the organization of the Aviation Association, in order to concentrate forces and take uniform steps under the same goal. The efficiency will be doubled and the actual results will be easily obtained.</p>
<p>Tragedy at the Zhengtai Rubber Factory</p>
<p>Aftermath of More Than One Hundred Worker Deaths and Injuries</p>
<p>The Court Inspects Eighty-One Male and Female Corpses</p>
<p>The Factory Holds a Buddhist Ceremony for the Souls of the Dead and Seven Articles of Aftermath Measures are Agreed Upon</p>
<p>The Social Affairs Bureau Reflects on the Pain and Believes That Factory Inspections Cannot Be Postponed or Delayed</p>
<p>The Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council Personally Visits to Express Condolences and Speaks on the Importance of Factory Law</p>
<p>The Zhengtai Rubber Factory No. 1 on Tangshan Road in Pudong exploded a rubber steaming cylinder due to an electrical fault in the motor line at approximately 9 a.m. the day before yesterday, destroying the entire factory and burning to death more than 100 workers and injuring more than 50 workers and staff. The factory's shareholders' meeting was held to discuss the aftermath measures. The Social Affairs Bureau sent officials to investigate thoroughly and released the details of the disaster. The details are as follows: Inspection of Six Corpses. Yesterday morning, a female worker, Gao Zhu, died of serious injuries. The Guangren Hospital notified the police, who sent detectives to carry the body to the body inspection office on Feilun Road. Then, the prosecutor of the First Special Court arrived at the office to confirm the cause of death. Gao Changfu, the son of the deceased, was summoned and questioned. He was instructed to collect the coffin for burial. Guo Jun was deeply concerned that there might still be remains in the rubble and had not been completely excavated. Therefore, he led the clerk Wang Zuyi, the forensic doctor, and the police to the scene of the accident to investigate. The firefighters and the Chinese and Western detectives of the Yulin Road Police Station in charge were supervising the workers to carry out excavation work. From early morning to near noon, four male corpses and one female corpse were successively excavated. All of them were incomplete. After repeated identification by the factory staff at the scene, it could only be speculated that the four male corpses were Ren Rongtang, Xue Dingde, Xu Shunjin, and Shen Yongxiang. After the accident at the factory, in addition to the injured who were sent to the hospital for treatment, there were also six male workers missing: Ren Rongtang, Xue Dingde, Xu Shunjin, Shen Yongxiang, Shen Guiming, and Su Ajiu. Therefore, it was suspected that these four male corpses were four of the six. However, it is still difficult to verify whether this is a misidentification or not. The other female corpse was even more impossible to know her name. Guo Jun inspected the male and female corpses according to the law and ordered Pushan Villa to temporarily collect them for burial. Guo Jun also instructed the Western police chief of the Yulin Road Police Station to continue to work hard. If any more corpses were found, they should be transported to the body inspection office on Feilun Road and reported for inspection. The police chief agreed. Guo then returned to the court with the clerk and others. In total, there were as many as 81 male and female corpses inspected by the court in the past two days, which can be said to be an unprecedented tragedy.</p>
<p>Factory's Aftermath: The Zhengtai Rubber Factory held an emergency shareholders' meeting the night before last, where manager Huang Jianqing reported the sudden change in the First Manufacturing Factory. It was decided on the spot: (1) to register the workers who were killed and those who escaped; (2) to give appropriate funeral expenses to the victims; (3) to ask Pushan Villa to handle the collection for burial; (4) to plan a public funeral at the Chang'an Cemetery; (5) to hold a Buddhist ceremony for the dead for three days starting on the 24th; (6) The second factory will stop work for one day on the 22nd to mourn. The factory also issued a temporary aftermath statement saying: This factory unfortunately suffered a disaster due to an electrical fire in the drying room at approximately 9 a.m. on the 21st of this month. The workers on duty could not escape in time, resulting in this disaster, which is deeply regretted. In order to seek the aftermath, the factory immediately convened a shareholders' meeting to formulate measures, which are listed below: (1) Injured workers and families of the victims are requested to register with the designated victim registration office of the factory within three days for future reference. (2) The factory will give appropriate burial expenses to the families of the deceased who can identify the bodies of the deceased and collect them for burial themselves. (3) For the bodies that cannot be identified and those who are unwilling to collect them for burial themselves, the factory will prepare coffins and bury them in the Chang'an Cemetery in Minhang. (4) All injured persons will receive appropriate medical expenses from the factory according to the severity of their injuries. (5) The factory will discuss and negotiate compensation fees for the families of all the deceased after verifying the number of people. (6) A Buddhist ceremony will be held for the dead on the 24th of this month for three days, with the address at the first factory. (7) The second factory will stop work for one day on the 23rd in memory of the workers who were killed in the first factory.</p>
<p>Registration of Missing Persons: Since the accident at the factory, a temporary registration office has been set up at No. 566 Zhengtai Fang, Dalianwan Road. Whether it is an escape or a disaster, it must be registered. The reporter learned from the investigation yesterday that out of 153 male workers, six have been identified as missing: Xu Shunjin, Su Ajiu, Ren Rongtang, Shen Guiming, Shen Yongxiang, and Jiang Dingde. Out of 277 female workers, 122 were missing. Of the remaining 155 workers, 69 had not been found as of last night and were reported missing. The names are as follows: Mao Wenmei, Chen Jufeng, Yang Shi, Shen Xiaomei, Zheng Xingzhi, Xu Yinxiu, Qi Yangsan, Zhang Sanmei, Wang Xiaomei, Li Ximei, Chen Suoxi, Zhang Xiuying, Zhao Xiaomei, Jiang Fengdi, Sun Sanquan, Xu Xiuying, Yang Rendi, Chen Aiying, Zhou Chenshi, Jiang Lanfen, Ding Fengdi, Qian Shi, Ling Dadi, Xu Sanmei, Zhang Baodi, Xu Erlang, Zhu Simei, A Er, Fei Jinlan, Zhang Wangshi, Xue Quanmei, Yu Dai Shi, A Er's wife, Hu Amei, Zhang Damei, Shen Jinlian, Jiang Jinmei, Xue Baomei, Xing Baobao, Wang Youdi, Huang Lianmei, Su A Er, Zhang Xiaoxu, Gao Qingxiu, Ding Amao, Zhang Yuzhen, Shen Fengzhen, Ji Awang, Zhu Zhangshi, Zhou Jinzhang, Chen Dongmei, Qian Meiying, Xie Ruifang, Zhang Lindi, Gao Qiaoyun, Qian Jinfeng, Shen Fuzheng, Chen Agen, Qiu Fengxian, Qiu Shuzhen, Qian Jinmei, Liu Bamei, Wang Xiuying, Pan Xiaomei, Shen Jinfeng, Liu Abao, Shen Lindi, Xu Gendi, Ding Yuqin, etc.</p>
<p>Investigation of the Injured: The day before yesterday, after the accident, a total of 21 seriously injured people were sent to the hospital. However, as of yesterday, one person, Gao Zhu, died at Guangren Hospital. There are now only 20 people. The list is as follows: (Guangren Hospital) Qian Shengshi, Qingyang, Wang Jinda, local, Ding Chenshi, Wuxi, Zhang Zhaodi, details unknown, foreign; (Renji Hospital) Zhao Jinying, local, Jiang Hongmei, Jiangyin, Wang Guizhen, local; (Tongren Hospital) Shen Hanren (male); (Zixin Hospital) Cai Chenshi, Nantong, Yang Wushi, Changzhou, Qian Xueshi, Qingyang, Chen Xingzhen, local, Shen Ajin, local, Chen Chenshi, local; (Sanatorium) Shun Jun, Ningbo, Zheng Guijin, Dongting, Xu Yuejin, Qingyang, Hou Jinfu (male).</p>
<p>Municipal Government Investigation</p>
<p>The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, due to the explosion of the Zhengtai Rubber Factory, which resulted in the burning to death of more than 100 workers, specially sent Tian Heqing, Zhu Guilin, Li Shude, and others from the Third Section to rush to the scene yesterday morning to investigate the truth and inspect the safety equipment of the factory in order to review the case. According to Tian Heqing, director of the inspection section of the Third Section of the Bureau, after the disaster occurred at the factory, the Bureau immediately sent personnel to investigate. According to the factory personnel, the cause of the accident was an electrical fault in the motor line, which caused the cellulose in the coating room to burn. The steaming room and the coating room were adjacent to each other, and the temperature in the steaming cylinder rose sharply, causing the air pressure in the cylinder to increase suddenly, resulting in an explosion. This is reasonable. However, it is impossible to confirm whether the cellulose in the coating room was caused by an electrical fault in the motor line. As for the allowances and pensions that workers should receive for death and injury due to work, Article 45 of the Factory Law has detailed provisions: (1) For workers who are temporarily unable to work due to injury or illness, in addition to bearing their medical expenses, they shall be given a daily allowance of two-thirds of their average wage. If they have not recovered after six months, their daily allowance may be reduced to one-half of their average wage, but it is limited to one year. (2) For workers who become disabled due to injury or illness and permanently lose all or part of their ability to work, they shall be given a disability allowance. The allowance shall be based on the severity of the disability, but shall not exceed three years of the average wage or be lower than one year of the average wage. (3) For deceased workers, in addition to a funeral fee of 50 yuan, their families shall be given a pension of 300 yuan and two years of the average wage. The factory should follow these regulations to emphasize humanity and comply with the law. The Bureau has always paid close attention to factory safety during the implementation of factory inspections. This tragedy further proves that factory safety equipment cannot be ignored. However, the factory is located in the Public Concession, and the Bureau has not been able to conduct inspections of factories in the Concession due to the obstruction of the Concession authorities. Seeing the tragedy today, I deeply feel the importance of factory inspections, and it is even more necessary to conduct factory inspections in the Concession as soon as possible. Disasters in factories harm not only workers, but also cause significant losses to the factory. Therefore, when the factory's safety equipment matters are guided and improved by the Bureau's inspectors, they should be followed at any time to avoid the recurrence of similar tragedies. I wonder what the factories in the Concession think about the current obstruction of inspections by the Concession authorities.</p>
<p>Chairman's Condolences</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, Pei Er, Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, and Sai Ye, an official from the Information Office of the Shanghai Municipal Council, went to the scene of the disaster to inspect. Seeing many charred and unrecognizable corpses being recovered from the rubble, they were saddened and speechless. Pei Er represented the Shanghai Municipal Council to express deep condolences to the victims and also expressed the views of the authorities, saying that the Factory Law in the Concession is a very important matter. Although the Shanghai Municipal Council did not believe that this tragedy was caused by the lack of a Factory Law, it said that it is unheard of in the world to set up the boiler room and coating room downstairs in a factory that employs hundreds of people. This kind of tragedy can only be remedied by an appropriate Factory Law. If the local authorities could implement factory safety regulations as soon as possible, the workers would benefit greatly, and the tragedy of yesterday would not be seen again.</p>
<p>Sent Police to Guard</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, at the entrance of Zhengtai Rubber Factory at the intersection of Tangshan Road and Dalianwan Road, the Yulin Road Police Station sent Chinese and Western patrol officers to cordon off the area with ropes, prohibiting vehicles and pedestrians from passing through. The registration office on Dalianwan Road, the entrance of the first factory on Tangshan Road, and the burned factory were guarded by Chinese police officers sent by the police station, prohibiting idlers from entering.</p>
<p>Another Report on the Accident</p>
<p>Currently, the traffic near the factory has not been fully restored. In addition to the records in this newspaper, there are also additional details about the brief history of the factory's establishment and the cause of this accident. The Zhengtai Rubber Factory No. 1 is located at No. 1025 Tangshan Road, a two-story factory building divided into front and rear sections. It has been open for four years. The largest shareholder is Liu Yongkang (号善斋), a Jiangyin native who resides in Ximen. The initial capital was 120,000, but it has since increased to 180,000. The front section of the factory is used as the office for staff, and the rear downstairs is the male workers' workshop, and the upstairs is for female workers, specializing in making rubber overshoes and boxes. There are four oil pots in the downstairs workshop. The cause of the accident is said to be that the oil poured into the pot for frying was not evenly heated. At 9 a.m. the day before yesterday, one pot exploded first, and another pot exploded after that. The building collapsed after these two huge shocks. The electrical wires in the building were destroyed immediately, and then a fire broke out. The female workers upstairs fell to their deaths as the house collapsed and were mostly buried in the fire, unable to escape, and suffered this tragedy. Also, the Luxun Foreign Firm warehouse on Jiangxi Road next door to the left of the factory was almost completely burned due to the fire. The China Tobacco Company on the right next door suffered less damage. Water insurance prices are likely to rise.</p>
<p>Preliminary Procedures for Insurance Companies</p>
<p>According to the Damei Evening News, after the clouds of war gathered over Jehol, insurance companies in this port engaged in water insurance have temporarily cancelled the war risk clauses in all insurance policies. It is reported that this move occurred last Saturday, in response to the London Lloyd's action of cancelling the war risk clauses in water insurance policies to and from the China-Japan route. Yesterday (21st), many people from various insurance companies came to inquire about the news, but business was slow, and the current water insurance rates have not increased. It is said that this move is a preventive measure, so that the premium can be temporarily increased in the event of an emergency. According to a certain person in the insurance industry, the increase in water and insurance fees on coastal routes will depend entirely on the future development of the situation. The current water insurance rate is about one in 1,600 of the insured amount. In the event that Japan prevents merchant ships from navigating, the London water insurance rate may soar to 2% or 3%, which is also unknown. The water insurance rate in Mubu is mostly increased or decreased based on London, but if London soars to 3% or 4%, then the port will examine the situation and exercise its own discretion. It is reported that during the Shanghai war last year, the water insurance rate had risen to 50/1000 or 75/1000, even reaching 1%.</p>
<p>Washington's Birthday</p>
<p>American Nationals Celebrate Grandly Yesterday</p>
<p>Yesterday was the anniversary of the birth of Washington, the first President of the United States. American nationals in this port all hung flags and celebrated. In addition to all public and private agencies and organizations taking individual days off, American Consul General Ke Yinhahn held a military ceremony at the Jing'an Temple Racecourse at 8:30 yesterday morning, which was directed by American naval officer Moss.</p>

<p>Insurance Policyholders in the Disaster Area</p>
<p>Petitioned the Municipal Government Yesterday</p>
<p>More Than 300 People</p>
<p>Traveling in Many Cars</p>
<p>Led by a Large Bamboo Cloth Banner</p>
<p>Each Person Holding Burning Incense</p>
<p>Fire insurance policyholders in the disaster area of Zhabei in this port have been negotiating for years on the issue of compensation, but have not achieved any results. Therefore, the Association of Progress was convened on the 19th, and it was decided to convene all policyholders to petition the municipal government.</p>
<p>Rushing to the Municipal Government: At 8 a.m. yesterday, the Association of Progress convened more than 300 policyholders at the Charity Group on Datong Road in Zhabei, gathered them, and drove in more than a dozen moving trucks to Xietu Road. The Security Office, after hearing the news, immediately sent soldiers to protect the parking place in order to maintain order. After the petition group got out of the car, they immediately formed a team and walked to the open space in front of the municipal government. Two people led the way, holding a large bamboo cloth banner with the words [Shanghai Disaster Area Fire Insurance Policyholders Petition Group]. The other people held burning incense and carried a large number of bread to show their persistence.</p>
<p>Petition Situation: Then, Mu Yuelin, Wang Zhixiang, Zheng Shaojin, Ma Rugen, Wang Weigong, Situ Yi, Cai Tonghua, and others were selected as representatives to present the petition to the mayor. Secretary-General Yu Hongjun received them. The representatives stated their intention and asked the municipal government to find a way to resolve the compensation issue as soon as possible. Secretary-General Yu explained the matter in detail in terms of law and fact and expressed the municipal government's deep concern for the affected households. He said that the municipal government would find a way to contact the other party as soon as possible to resolve the issue as soon as possible, and promised to convey the contact situation to the representatives of the disaster area in a week. The representatives were satisfied and reported to the entire petition group before returning to the car and leaving.</p>
<p>Petition Memorandum: Stealing a look at the fire insurance compensation negotiation in the Zhabei war zone, it has been nearly a year since then. The method of Chinese businessmen issuing bonds as compensation has not yet been implemented. The foreign insurance company relies on the concession as a talisman, and firmly adheres to the unfair unilateral rules as an excuse, and has no sincerity in expressing this compensation. The general public who has suffered disasters has suffered from hunger and cold and has called for help all day long. The situation was known by the government. Now, the policyholders have to kneel and beg the government to give them effective relief measures so that the disaster area compensation can be resolved immediately. They cannot wait to be ordered.</p>
<p>Wang Xiaolai</p>
<p>Will Host a Banquet for Various Leaders Today</p>
<p>To Discuss Insurance and Business Tax</p>
<p>Mr. Wang Xiaolai, Chairman of the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, was requested by the Zhabei Disaster Area Fire Insurance Compensation Committee to mediate with the foreign insurance companies in this port. Therefore, Mr. Wang is scheduled to host a banquet again for consuls from various countries and compradors of foreign insurance companies at the Qiaoshi Chamber of Commerce in Tianhou Palace at 2 p.m. today to discuss a solution. The matter of the concession holding a business tax will also be discussed at the same time. It is reported that Mayor Wu, Yu Qiaqing, Lin Kanghou, and others have all been invited to attend the meeting.</p>
<p>Heard about the Water Cut Yesterday</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council is Currently Studying the Opinions of All Parties</p>
<p>Disputes Occur Between Bureau Households and Taiping Faucets</p>
<p>According to the Dalu News, regarding the issue of tap water fees in the Public Concession, the Shanghai Municipal Council is carefully studying the opinions and positions of the Real Estate Association and the Water Company, and is cooperating with the Chinese Directors to find a compromise solution that can be accepted by both parties. Although a practical solution has not yet been obtained, it is heard that the principle of lower water prices for lower rents and higher water prices for higher rents is being used as a guideline for the work. It is also heard that the Water Company has sent out several solutions, and the Shanghai Municipal Council is carefully studying one of the plans that is most easily accepted by both parties.</p>
<p>According to the Guowen News Agency, the residents of Jingxingli, Dongyouheng Road, have been without food and drink since the water pipes were cut off. On the 20th of this month, they sent representatives to visit Mr. Pei Er, the chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, along with representatives from Sanxingfang and Jingyuli, to request the opening of water in order to maintain people's livelihood. It was said that Mr. Pei Er agreed to open the Taiping faucet when necessary for food and other purposes. According to the words of Mr. Pei Er, the supervisor of Jingxingli opened the Taiping faucet on the road at 9 a.m. yesterday for the residents of the lane to use. Unexpectedly, the patrolman caught sight of him and believed that opening the Taiping faucet without permission violated the police regulations and took the supervisor to the police station for custody. After Wang Yaozeng, the representative of the tenants in Xingfang, went to the Shanghai Municipal Council and met with He Dekui to handle the matter, he repeatedly stated that this move was based on the instructions of the chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council and was not illegal, and he also signed a letter to the police station to bail out the arrested supervisor. It is expected that the police station did not receive this order from the Shanghai Municipal Council, so this dispute occurred. The representatives then negotiated with the Water Company. According to Mr. Locke, the manager of the company, the Water Company is not responsible for supplying water to the Taiping faucets, but in consideration of the residents without water, it has to deal with it from the right. Residents can notify the company by telephone when necessary, and the company will immediately send someone to open the water. However, according to the person who opens the water in the company, the Taiping faucets in the nearby three miles can be opened as much as possible, day and night, so that the residents can use them.</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Requests the Municipal Government</p>
<p>To Relieve the Disaster Area of Wusong</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce presented a document to the Municipal Government yesterday, saying: "According to a letter from the Wusong Branch of the Association, after the Wusong business suffered from the January 28th war, the entire town was destroyed. After the local government took over, it gradually gathered refugees to make a living. I had to reluctantly resume business, but in fact, the number of people who could clean up the stove and start business was less than 40%. Most of the businesses that have been restored are also sluggish and difficult. The reasons for the decline are: one is that after the war, the trauma has not been restored, and the purchasing power of the people has not been sufficient, which is one of the reasons. However, there are other reasons that are enough to hinder the revival of Wusong business. The reasons are four: (1) After the war, the Municipal Works Bureau expanded the streets and houses, and the base changed, and the rent increased greatly. Those who are thin and self-审 have stopped and stayed in other ports. (2) The Municipal Works Bureau did not allow the disaster-stricken merchants in the disaster area to borrow a little for construction materials. The project was too real. Although the Wusong area was incorporated into the modern city of Shanghai, it was no different from the inland towns. Moreover, the Wusong area was in the midst of this unprecedented catastrophe. It is already not easy to seek an immediate life, and it is not possible for the disaster-stricken merchants with short capital to follow the modern urban-style buildings, which is enough to hinder the opportunity for the revival of the disaster area. (3) Wusong business has always been the most prosperous period for the entire year in the spring fishing season and the autumn cotton market. The Niu Tou cars come and go like weaving, and they are on the way. Since the Financial Bureau has collected the car donations, the villagers are coming to avoid the fines. Therefore, the commercial decline in the autumn flower market is due to this. (4) The decrease in population is also the reason for the failure of business. Based on the above reasons, the decline of Wusong's business is not unreasonable. For the sake of the disaster area's revival, the actual situation of the difficulty will be reported to Junhui for insight. I respectfully request you to appeal to the Municipal Government on behalf of the people, based on the principle of rescuing and reviving the disaster area, and give relief to the above-mentioned painful situation, so the disaster-stricken merchants are very fortunate." According to this, the various points of the Zhengtai Branch Office's statement that the commercial downturn in the war zone, or the municipal government and the rich bureau are improving the urban area and want to be bound by urbanization, which has led to a sharp increase in land prices and rents, which cannot be borne by small merchants after the war. Or the excessive collection of the Niu Tou car donation has caused the abandonment of trade and transactions between the countryside. In addition, the factories have stopped working, the schools have been suspended, and the population has been drastically reduced, and the commerce will decline. The nuclear facts are the real situation of the merchants after the robbery. For the sake of the disaster area's revival, appropriate relief should be given. It is appropriate to present the facts as a request, and I respectfully request the government to review and approve the relief plan after deliberation by the bureau.</p>

<h3>War Debts and the World Economic Conference: Washington Actively Planning</h3>
<p>Roosevelt Receives French Ambassador</p>
<p>US-French War Debts to be Discussed Soon</p>
<p>New York, 21st [of the Republic] – French Ambassador Claudel paid a visit to President-elect Roosevelt here today. Afterwards, it was reported that the United States will not only formally discuss war debts with France, but will also soon begin a campaign in Washington to convene a World Economic Conference as early as possible.</p>
<p>According to friends of Roosevelt, today's meeting with the French Ambassador was part of his plan to gather information about the economic conditions of other countries, especially the relationship between economic conditions and war debts. It is said that Roosevelt may abandon the current government's policy of not discussing war debts with France before it makes supplementary payments for the December overdue debt installment. Roosevelt believes that delaying discussion of the war debt issue is not in France's interest either, so he wants to know when they can make supplementary payments in order to determine his plan for reorganizing the entire war debt structure. After meeting with Claudel, Roosevelt also received Canadian Minister Herridge. It is rumored that their discussions were about general economic matters, with their focus also on the economic conference. Although Roosevelt has not expressed anything about the two plans – war debts and the economic conference – financial circles here believe that Roosevelt, after yesterday's meeting with British Ambassador Lindsay, has received sufficient encouragement and is preparing to launch both matters as soon as possible. Therefore, it was announced today that Hull will be appointed Secretary of State and Woodin as Secretary of the Treasury, so that the two can openly begin preparations. It is now expected that the two will informally discuss these two major issues with the British and French ambassadors and other diplomatic representatives within this week. As for the current Secretary of State Stimson, it is said that he not only agrees with this move, but it is also his long-held desire.</p>
<p>Anglo-American Cooperation</p>
<p>London, 21st (Reuters) – Outgoing US Ambassador to Britain Mellon gave a farewell speech at a banquet at the Pilgrims Society tonight, saying that the cornerstone of American foreign policy is the continued friendship and close cooperation with the British people. In the eyes of the American people, England is still a country that can enchant the heart. Even in this difficult and changing era, Britain has proven that its ancient greatness has not left it, and it remains a barrier to humanitarianism. Many of the British and American elites present at the banquet heard Mellon's statement and stood up to cheer.</p>
<p>London, 21st (Reuters) – Foreign Secretary Simon received a telegram today from the British Ambassador to the United States, Lindsay, reporting on his recent meeting with Roosevelt. It is now believed that further exchanges of views are needed before British representatives go to the United States to discuss the war debt issue.</p>
<p>Michigan Banks Reopen</p>
<p>Detroit, 21st [of the Republic] – The Governor of Michigan has ordered all banks in the state to reopen tomorrow, but operations will be subject to restrictions. In most cities, depositors will only be allowed to withdraw 5% of their deposits.</p>
<p>Appointment of Important Cabinet Members in the New US Government</p>
<p>Hull as Secretary of State</p>
<p>Woodin as Secretary of the Treasury</p>
<p>New York, 21st [of the Republic] – US President-elect Roosevelt announced today that Senator Hull will be appointed Secretary of State of the new government and Woodin as Secretary of the Treasury. Hull's appointment as Secretary of State has long been expected, while Woodin's name only recently emerged as a candidate for Secretary of the Treasury. His appointment today was quite unexpected. It is rumored that Roosevelt initially intended to appoint Senator Glass, who served as Secretary of the Treasury under President Wilson, to the position of Secretary of the Treasury, but Glass was unwilling to take the job, so he asked his close friend, Woodin, a progressive Republican, to take on the role.</p>
<p>The positions of Secretary of State and Secretary of the Treasury are the most important cabinet members in the US government, no less than the President's right and left hands. Therefore, Hull and Woodin will become central figures on the international political stage in the next four years, and will have a particularly important relationship with the Far East. The people of the country will be eager to know about their life ambitions and actions. Hull is one of the cornerstones of the Democratic Party and has long been known within the party as "a philosopher." Although he only entered the Senate after 1931, it has been a while since he served as a member of the House of Representatives. Throughout his life, he has worked as a lawyer, judge, state legislator, and leader of the Democratic Party in his state, and has held public office and has always been known for his familiarity with foreign affairs. From 1921 to 1924, he served as chairman of the Democratic National Committee. Later, in the House of Representatives, he drafted the income tax and estate tax laws. When he entered the Senate, he was recognized as an authority on international affairs. In recent years, Democratic and Republican leaders often consulted Hull on diplomatic matters. In his recent speeches, he advocated reducing tariff barriers to promote world trade, and proposed that the United States first reduce tariffs by 10% to set an example, and urged other countries to follow suit as soon as possible. On December 5 last year, Hull expressed his views on war debts, stating that many relief measures to revitalize world trade should be implemented first before discussing war debt reductions. Regardless of the nature of war debts, before various countries seek consideration from the US for their debt reduction requests,</p>
<p>Another Bomb</p>
<p>Mailed to Roosevelt</p>
<p>Chicago Mayor's Condition Worsens</p>
<p>(Washington, 22nd Reuters) According to the Washington Post, a bomb mailed to President-elect Roosevelt was discovered at the post office today. A small package suddenly fell out of a mailbag and broke open, and upon inspection, it was found to have been sent from a New York naval base. It contained a bomb tightly wrapped in scrap iron wire. According to experts, the explosion of this bomb would not be fatal, but could cause significant damage.</p>
<p>(Miami, 22nd Reuters) Chicago Mayor Cermak's condition has deteriorated, with a temperature of 101 degrees and a pulse of 108. It is said to be caused by enteritis. The perpetrator, Zangara, was sentenced to eighty years in prison by the court yesterday, and his lawyer has decided not to appeal.</p>
<p>They should first show their attitude towards a broader and more fundamental plan. It is now expected that Hull's views will be in line with Roosevelt's. Woodin has never been known in the political world, but he is heavily involved in manufacturing and financial businesses. He is an old friend of Roosevelt for many years. During Roosevelt's tenure as Governor of New York, he would consult him on financial matters. Before this election, Woodin was a staunch Republican, but according to Morey, his fiscal policies have long been in line with Roosevelt's and Democratic leaders. Woodin became the Vice President of a major manufacturing business at the age of 27. Later, he was involved in many industrial enterprises, and he was also skilled in art and music. His songs have been performed by various countries. Although many Democratic politicians were shocked by the news of his appointment as Secretary of the Treasury, the US financial community welcomed it, believing it to be a guarantee of continued stable monetary policy.</p>
<p>Pittman, Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee</p>
<p>Swanson, Secretary of the Navy</p>
<p>Washington, 21st Reuters – Senator Swanson will be the Secretary of the Navy. It was previously said that he would be appointed Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Now that he will be the Secretary of the Navy, the chairmanship of the Foreign Affairs Committee may be given to Pittman, who advocates the use of silver. Someone who visited Hull informed him of his appointment as Secretary of State. Hull is suffering from the flu and is bedridden. He claimed that he had accepted the position some time ago and had begun to deal with the problems facing the world and especially related to the United States. Woodin recently discussed economic issues with Roosevelt.</p>
<p>Washington, 21st [of the Republic] – According to reliable sources, Senator Walsh has accepted the position of Attorney General, and Farley has accepted the position of Postmaster General. It is believed that the entire list of the new cabinet will be announced within a few days, because Roosevelt said that he wanted all cabinet members to participate in solving all problems.</p>
<p>Austrian Arms Case Resolved</p>
<p>Italian Government Agrees to Return</p>
<p>London, 21st Reuters – The Austrian arms case can now be considered to have been concluded. This afternoon, Foreign Secretary Simon stated in the House of Commons that the Italian Ambassador informed him that the Italian government was prepared to agree to return the arms that were transported to Austria to Italy. The Ambassador also said that some of the arms had been returned from Austria to Italy, and the Austrian authorities had certified that the rest would soon be shipped.</p>
<p>Rome, 21st [of the Republic] – According to highly reliable sources, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini will personally attend the Parliament this week to explain the Hindenburg arms case. Mussolini is likely to announce an important declaration on Italian diplomacy in his speech. The declaration is broad in scope and will cover not only the general diplomatic situation, but also the relations between Italy and France, the relations between Italy and the Entente countries, and issues such as the Central European Little Entente.</p>
<p>Vienna, 22nd (Havas) – Part of the Central European arms smuggling has been returned to the original owners, and the rest will also be returned, and will be certified by Austrian customs officials. The Austrian government, while not formally satisfied with the intelligence of Britain and France, has actually satisfied them.</p>
<p>Germany's Factional Strife Rages</p>
<p>Hitler's Party Members Run Rampant Everywhere</p>
<p>Berlin, 22nd [of the Republic] – Last night, the election meeting of the Catholic Center Party in Krefeld was disrupted by the National Socialist Party and dispersed. Today, Hitler issued a stern declaration, denouncing this act, saying that it must have been done by well-meaning people posing as members of the National Socialist Party. All members of the National Socialist Party should refrain from such actions. Members should strictly abide by discipline. Our efforts are now focused on overthrowing Marxism. If the leaders of the Center Party argue with our party in the election campaign, I will deal with them personally.</p>
<p>Berlin, 22nd [of the Republic] – Last night, when the Catholic Center Party held an election meeting in Krefeld, chaired by Stegerwald, the former cabinet minister and the party's most famous leader, many members of the National Socialist Party's stormtroopers mixed into the meeting with fake tickets, and covered up their uniforms with plain clothes. When Stegerwald was speaking, members of the National Socialist Party threw paper firecrackers from the audience, causing a conflict. Stegerwald and many of the attending priests rose up to intervene and were all beaten. The police later dissolved the meeting. The leaders of the Center Party sent a telegram to the Minister of the Interior, lodging a protest. The Minister has not yet responded. A total of five people died and twenty-two were seriously injured in political conflicts in various places last night. Among the dead, one was from the National Socialist Party, and two each were from the Social Democratic Party and the Communist Party.</p>
<p>Berlin, 22nd (Reuters) – National Socialists and left-wing parties fought during the night, resulting in two deaths and many injuries. Across the country, five people died and many were seriously injured.</p>
<p>Berlin, 21st [of the Republic] – The German parliamentary elections are less than two weeks away, and preparations are becoming increasingly tense. According to the Election Supervision Bureau's announcement today, the number of political parties that have registered candidate lists has decreased significantly this time, with only eight parties. During the November elections last year, there were a total of eighteen parties. During the May elections the year before, there were as many as twenty-five parties. This is because all the small parties are attached to the large parties to avoid wasting votes. The registered parties, in order of strength, are (1) the National Socialist Party, (2) the Social Democratic Party, (3) the Communist Party, (4) the Catholic Center Party, (5) the newly formed Nationalist Front Black, White, and Red Party (the National Rights Party and the Steel Helmet League both belong to it), (6) the Bavarian People's Party, (7) the newly formed Christian National Group (including)</p>
<p>The German People's Party, the Christian Social Party, the German Farmers' Party, and the Farmers' Party), and (8) the newly established Hutenburg Farmers' Party. As for the small parties in the previous parliament, such as the National Party, they are attached to the Social Democratic Party, and the Economic Party is united with the Center Party. In addition, there is a newly formed Socialist Front Party, which the authorities regard as a communist organ and have not approved, but other political circles believe that the party is the core of closer cooperation between the Social Democratic Party and the Communist Party, and stands in opposition to the union of the National, Social, and National Rights parties.</p>
<p>Colombia Breaks Relations</p>
<p>Guayaquil, Ecuador, 21st [of the Republic] – The Colombian Minister to Peru lowered his flag and returned home. It is said that although there is no declaration of war between Colombia and Peru, real war is already underway. At this time, the people of Peru are quite agitated. When he left Peru, a mob broke into the Colombian embassy, ​​seized items from the embassy and left. Peruvian officials watched from the sidelines and did not interfere. Also in Callao, a mob looted items from the Colombian consulate, and the police did not interfere either. Peruvian troops are being transported by plane to the vicinity of Leticia. The two sides' troops have been fighting sporadically in several places along the border. Currently, Peruvian people aged 21 to 45 have been drafted into the army.</p>
<p>Another Statement by the Chinese Representative to Japan (1)</p>
<p>The Spirit of the Treaty of Portsmouth</p>
<p>Four</p>
<p>The Japanese representative's memorandum denies China's faithful fulfillment of treaty obligations, and claims that "the cause of the current disputes and China's difficulties with other powers lies in China's failure to fulfill the treaty provisions." Japan has continued to disregard the League of Nations Covenant, the Kellogg-Briand Pact, the Nine-Power Treaty, and the Executive Yuan's resolutions of September 30 and December 10, 1931. There is no need to answer its accusations against China. It should be known that the current situation in Manchuria is entirely caused by Japan's disregard for international obligations and its determination to carry out its traditional policy of invading and developing the Asian continent. The reason why the League of Nations feels difficulty with this is because Japan is unwilling to fulfill its promises to withdraw its troops and stop actions that aggravate the situation. Japan has not only established "Manchukuo" to facilitate its land invasion plan, but has also recognized it despite world opinion. The chairman of the Executive Yuan expressed regret over this latest act of violating international treaties at the meeting on September 24. The Japanese representative claimed at the special meeting on December 6 that Japan was a loyal member of the League of Nations. On the other hand, Japan also claimed that the reason why it did not seek help from the League of Nations was because the League of Nations, with its current organization and scope, could not be expected to provide prompt and effective protection. From this, it can be seen that Japan has deliberately violated the Covenant and is unwilling to abide by the true provisions.</p>
<p>Most of the Japanese representative's speech alluded to the point of war, hoping to arouse the audience's sympathy for Japan's military policy. He said</p>
<p>"The United States of America, a great power on the west coast of the Pacific Ocean, has not yet joined the League of Nations, nor has Soviet Russia. Japan's neighbor is the huge China, and its situation is so worrying. May I ask, if the various countries were Japan, what action should they take?"</p>
<p>We know a lot about the true spirit and true purpose of the United States' diplomatic policy in the Pacific. In its possible future development, it can be decided that it will not cause serious fear. As for the situation in China, it is not a threat to peace in the Far East. The reason why this situation is terrible is due to Japan's policy of obstructing China's unification in order to fulfill its ambition to develop the continent (to be continued).</p>
<p>Resident in Wuhu</p>
<p>Japanese Consul Convened a Meeting</p>
<p>Japanese Naval Sailors Wander Ashore from Time to Time</p>
<p>Wuhu Correspondence: Japanese merchants operate businesses in Wuhu, giving them an important position on the Yangtze River. Taking the toys of the Yan Gang foreign firm as an example, they amount to 100,000 yuan in a single quarter during the Lunar New Year. Other things can be imagined. Important Japanese commercial agencies include Mitsubishi Corporation, Nippon Yusen Kaisha, Nissin Corporation, Yan Gang Foreign Firm, and Shintian Hotel. There are often about 100 Japanese men and women. There are two Japanese elementary schools. Therefore, Japanese warships are often stationed in Wuhu without interruption. Since the September 18th Incident, Japanese warships on the Yangtze River have become more active. Recently, there are the destroyer Kashi and the gunboat Fushimi on the Wuhu River, and other warships come and go frequently. For days, sailors from various ships have been wandering ashore from time to time, and plainclothes officers and Japanese expatriates follow them, with arrogant attitudes. Passers-by look askance, and they carry cameras to take pictures in places such as Yuzha Hill. The authorities are limited by the treaty and can only send security teams and police to follow them for protection. Yesterday, 46 sailors and officers from the two ships landed at the Mitsubishi Corporation pier and toured various places along North Ping Road, and then went to the Japanese Elementary School under Yuzha Hill for lunch. At 2 pm, they went to Ouxiangju Shintian Hotel to gather and have fun. The Public Security Bureau specially sent security teams and plainclothes police to patrol near the road to provide protection. At 4 pm, the Japanese consul in Wuhu, Shirasaki Shiro, convened a meeting of all officers, soldiers, and Japanese expatriates at the Nissin Corporation on the riverside. All circles in Wuhu attach great importance to this (20th).</p>
<p>Songjiang Land Survey New Songjiang Society Buys Land</p>
<p>People from all walks of life in this county believe that Songjiang still lacks a proper</p>
<p>A place of entertainment. Therefore, we have united comrades to organize the New Songjiang Society and are planning to build a clubhouse. The scale is grand. Since soliciting members, those who have joined have been very enthusiastic. The society has found a vacant land near Changqiao South Street on the Songwei County Road to build a garden, and has also purchased more than 20 acres of wasteland in the rear of the Yuyingtang at No. 60 Ye, No. 41 Bao, from the Shatian Bureau. The work is currently very intense. However, the local gentry, seeing the countless tombs on the land, some with owners and some without, each occupying half, have asked Minister Niu of the Ministry of Personnel to request the Ministry of Finance to set aside five or six acres of land from the land purchased by the two organizations to be used as a public cemetery, so that both public friendship and private feelings can be taken care of. The Provincial Department of Finance ordered the county to handle it. After receiving the document, County Magistrate Shen has already requested the Song Jinqing Shatian Bureau to set a date to jointly measure the address for reporting.</p>
<p>Wuxi is Building a Large Bridge</p>
<p>The Project is Progressing Rapidly</p>
<p>The river channel of Beili Bridge (also known as Lianrong Bridge) has been actively dredged by the River Works Committee since hiring workers. The section in front of the Wang Yuanlai Oil Company has been completed, while the section along the river of the sesame seed cake shop has not yet been completed. Only a few workers are removing the soil on both sides, and it can be completed in about one or two days. The revetments and docks on both sides have also been automatically dismantled and repaired by the merchants. As of yesterday, they have been completed one after another, looking brand new. The Municipal Engineering Office of the Construction Bureau sent personnel to measure the river works yesterday, and the inspection and acceptance can be done soon. All the bridges were originally planned to be slightly repaired, but because they were too damaged, the River Works Committee repeatedly held meetings to raise funds and reorganized. The original foreman Lu Jinhe contracted to build bridge protection frames in the bridge hole to avoid danger. At the same time, construction was started and the east and west bridge approaches on the south side of the bridge were demolished and deepened, and wooden stakes were driven in and watered with cement. Construction is currently underway. The bridge surface of the bridge is still strong, and the committee advocated not repairing it. This is because of funding. The center of the river has been completed, and the total depth has been dug to more than ten feet. In the future, after the dam is opened, ships will be able to come and go with great convenience.</p>
<p>Suzhou Business Community Raises Funds to Buy an Airplane</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Chamber of Commerce Federation held a joint meeting of directors and supervisors in Suzhou this time. After the general meeting was held on the afternoon of the 21st, the Wuxian County Chamber of Commerce hosted a banquet in the evening, and the committee members stayed at the Dongwu Hotel. At 8:00 am on the 22nd, they took three motorboats to Dengwei Mountain in Guangfu to explore the plum blossoms, and took the opportunity to discuss ways to raise funds to purchase an airplane. It is said that the proposed plan is to raise 200,000 yuan. The funds will be raised separately by the chambers of commerce of various counties in Jiangsu Province to purchase an airplane first. The name is Susang. The association will send letters to the chambers of commerce in each county to carry out fundraising. The committee members can return to Suzhou at 7:00 pm and are scheduled to return home separately that day.</p>
<p>Changzhou Shanghai Women's Hairdressing</p>
<p>Branch Opening</p>
<p>The Shanghai China Women's Hairdressing Vocational Society sent personnel to Changzhou last year to prepare for the organization of a branch.

<p>The First Offender in the Disturbance at the Changshu Theater Has Been Taken into Custody</p>
<p>After the Xiaoyao You Theater was destroyed by more than 200 people from the District Security Regiment on the night of the 15th of this month, some local people came forward to mediate in order to avoid the expansion of the incident, and planned to order each district of the third, fourth, and seventh to collect 100 yuan in foreign currency to compensate the theater for its losses. However, the Chief Regiment Commander Tan Yigui made no expression. Because someone filed a complaint with the province, the reports also expressed dissatisfaction with Tan. Tan then ordered Shen Zhi Qiao, the instructor of the third district, to be sent to the county government on Sunday. The trial was conducted by the trial officer, the chief of the security regiment, and the director of the office. As a result, it was impossible to find out because the public was prohibited from attending. However, the three interrogated Shen Zhi Qiao for three hours about whether he had instructed him, and then immediately took him into custody. A telegram was sent to the province for instructions. Yesterday, according to Tan Yigui, the chief regiment commander and county magistrate, the incident caused by the security regiment was a great disgrace to the entire group.</p>
<p>Zhenjiang Land Price Tax Extended Again</p>
<p>The second installment of the land price tax and reed tax in Zhenjiang County in the 21st year</p>
<p>The tax was due within two months of this year, and a surcharge of 10% was required. Subsequently, due to severe wind and snow and traffic obstructions, the Finance Bureau submitted a request for a one-month extension, and penalties would be imposed again by the 20th of this month. It has been approved by the Department of Finance and announced on record. Now, because the extended period coincides with the Lunar New Year, it is difficult to eliminate the accumulated habits of the townships and towns. In addition, continuous rain and snow have made the roads difficult to travel back and forth. In order to take care of the people's livelihood, the Provincial Department has been requested to continue the extension for eight days. The overdue penalty will be imposed at the end of the period to show consideration and emphasize tax collection.</p>
<p>Station Staff Assassinated</p>
<p>Qi Ziqing, a native of Qishuyan, Changzhou, is in his forties and works as a ticket checker at Zhenjiang Railway Station. He has been serving for several years and is diligent in his work. At about 2:00 pm the day before yesterday, he went out on business and did not return all night. Yesterday morning, his body was suddenly found in the Jinshan Temple North River. His head was cut in five places. The local security reported it to the Fourth Precinct of the Fifth Branch. After Pan, the patrol officer of the precinct, went to inspect it, he reported it to the court. Prosecutor Gu Chang led forensic police to inspect it. The inspection revealed that there were five knife marks on the head, confirming that he was injured and killed before his death. After the inspection, the stationmaster Tang Quanxian temporarily took possession of the body and telegraphed his family to claim it. The cause of the assassination is currently unknown.</p>
<p>Nantong Xiangshui Estuary Tax Police Transferred to Tongzhou</p>

<h3>Detainees in the Local Court Detention Center Stage Another Major Riot</h3>
<p>Dissatisfied with Prison Food and Token Issues</p>
<p>The Riot Was Loud and Was Suppressed Before It Could Get out of Hand.</p>
<p>The number of inmates in the Shanghai Local Court Detention Center ranks first in the country, making it particularly difficult to manage. Since Warden Wang Tingqi took office, there have been previous incidents of mass riots and disturbances. Unexpectedly, yesterday after 11:00 AM, during mealtime, the inmates once again staged a collective riot with great intensity. It is said that the reasons for the riot were dissatisfaction with the prison food, family visits, and the inconvenience of having to exchange money for tokens. After strong suppression by the detention center, the riot was quickly quelled.</p>
<p>City Police Department</p>
<p>Solves Murder Case Stemming from Adultery and Revenge</p>
<p>Xu Rongrong, residing at No. 1 Yanjia House, Jiangwan Sports Association Road, had dinner with Zhang Genbao (aka Tang Genbao) and Wang Shengtiao, both from the same village, at the home of Tang Xiaodi, Zhang's father-in-law, in Lujiazhai, on the afternoon of the 17th day of the fourth lunar month of the previous year. After dinner, around 8:00 PM, Xu Rongrong, Zhang Genbao, and Wang Shengtiao planned to return home separately. Just as they reached an open field near the entrance, Zhang Genbao shot and killed Xu Rongrong with a pistol. He then threatened Wang Shengtiao, saying, "Xu Rongrong and I had a grudge, and I killed him. You can go home and don't say anything." Afterwards, Zhang Genbao forced Lu Akun, a Chongming laborer, to help move the body and throw it into the Dagang River. The next day, Zhang Genbao's wife, Zhang Tangshi, went to Wang Shengtiao's house to thank him and pleaded with him not to reveal the matter, saying that the body had been entrusted to a Chongming person to be thrown into the Dagang River. Later, Wang Shengtiao, seeing that the deceased's mother, Xu Cai, and daughter-in-law, Xu Cai, were searching for Xu Rongrong without success, felt deeply saddened. Wang then told them the details of the murder. Xu Cai and her daughter-in-law then filed a lawsuit with the Shanghai Local Court. After investigation by the prosecutor, the facts were verified. The body of Xu Rongrong was handed over to the Red Cross for burial, and Xu's family claimed it for burial. At that time, the murderer Zhang Genbao fled and disappeared. Only Lu Akun and Zhang Tangshi, who helped dispose of the body, were arrested. After interrogation, they confessed without hesitation. The court sentenced both of them to three months of imprisonment and issued a warrant for the arrest of the fugitive Zhang Genbao for legal action, but he was never apprehended. It is now reported that the City Police Department encountered the murderer Zhang Genbao at the intersection of Jiangxi Road and Avenue Edward VII in the Public Concession the day before yesterday. He was arrested on the spot and taken to the police station for detention. The next day, he was sent to the First Special Court for interrogation and handed over to detective Lu Hexiang for further investigation. Yesterday morning, after interrogation, the suspect Zhang Genbao confessed, "[Xu Rongrong and I lived in the same village and knew each other. Since the outbreak of the January 28th Incident in Zhabei last year, he knew that I worked at Ruichang Iron and Copper Factory of Sassoon Company. Because the factory was very large, he asked to take refuge with me. I took him to the factory to live with my wife and others. We shared the daily expenses with Xu. After the ceasefire, we moved back and lived separately. Unexpectedly, Xu Rongrong had a human face but the heart of a beast. He repeatedly came to my house to seduce my wife, and sometimes invited me to go out to Shanghai to play, or invited friends to trick me into playing cards. Xu took the opportunity to sneak back to my house, intending to commit adultery with my wife. After being secretly informed by a friend, I began to pay attention to investigate. One day, Xu Rongrong and I came to Shanghai to gamble in a small club. Xu said to me, 'I have lost all my money. I am going to borrow money from a friend. I will be back soon.' I pretended to agree. I knew he would definitely go to my house again to commit adultery. It was midnight, and it was raining heavily. I hired a car and went home. After getting out of the car, I overheard Xu Rongrong in my room, begging my wife for sex. I immediately went to my father-in-law's house and returned home with my father-in-law, Tang Xiaodi. Xu Rongrong was still hiding in the attic and was discovered by me. He then pulled out a pistol and said to me, 'Do you want your life?' At that time, my wife, seeing the situation, quickly snatched Xu's pistol and hid it. Xu then went out and apologized to me. The next day, he came to my house again to ask my wife for the pistol, and threatened her. Because I could not return the gun, I pretended to ask Wang Shengtiao to borrow the pistol from Xu, saying that I wanted to fight someone. I hid it on my body. Until the evening of the 17th day of the fourth lunar month of the previous year, after finishing dinner at my father-in-law's house, Xu Rongrong asked Wang Shengtiao for the gun to harm me, so I shot and killed Xu."</p>
<p>Transfer of Evidence in the Case of Liang Youguang</p>
<p>The Director of the City Police Department, Wen Hongen, previously arrested Liang Youguang, an accomplice in the case of the communist leader Chen Duxiu, at No. 1044 East Siven Lane, Xinzha Road. After interrogation by the Third Division of the City Police Department, Liang confessed that he was an inspector sent by Chen Duxiu to various provinces and had just returned to Shanghai from Guangxi. This case was transferred by the Nanjing Military and Political Department to the Jiangsu High Court for trial. After repeated trials, Liang's testimony was evasive. Therefore, Judge Lin sent a letter to the City Police Department yesterday, requesting that the evidence obtained in the case of Liang Youguang be transferred to the court for legal action.</p>
<p>Chen Tugen Sentenced to Seven Years</p>
<p>Lu Akun, a native of Ximenwai, helped move the body and throw it into the Dagang River. The next day, Ren Lingjiannan was killed by Wang Wencai, a detective who had been dismissed from the Public Security Bureau, and a mob. At that time, many celebrities in the Chinese community were involved, and the murderer Chen Tugen was mistakenly released from the detention center and then re-arrested, causing major disputes. It is now reported that the judgment in this case was handed down yesterday. The accomplice Chen Tugen was sentenced to seven years of imprisonment. The civil lawsuit will be tried by the Immigration Court. Huang Zicheng and others were found not guilty. Continued Interrogation of the Zhenru Gambling Case</p>
<p>Yang Miaogen Not Involved, Boss Wu Tongxing on the Run</p>
<p>It was reported that Yang Miaogen was the boss of the Zhenru gambling case that the Public Security Bureau recently cracked, and that he was an unemployed vagrant. After investigation, it has been found that Mr. Yang is actually the captain of the second team of the Pengpu District Defense Corps and is very enthusiastic about local public welfare. He has been engaged in the local goods business for many years and has operated the Shunxing Local Goods Store on Suzhou Road for more than ten years. He is indeed a respectable merchant. At that time, he was mistakenly arrested while visiting a friend. After investigation by Director Wen of the Public Security Bureau, it was found that he was not involved, and he was immediately released. The boss, Wu Tongxing, is still on the run. Only his wife, Wu Li, has been detained. The eighty gamblers were all tried by the local court on the 18th of this month and fined 18 yuan each as a warning.</p>
<p>Wu Huaichun Accused</p>
<p>The Case of Raping the Sisters Concluded</p>
<p>The Second Special Court Scheduled to Pronounce Sentence</p>
<p>Shi Chen, a woman from Changshu, and her eldest daughter, Jinghua, retained a lawyer in the autumn of last year and filed a complaint with the Second Special District Local Court, accusing Wu Huaichun, a Suzhou native residing at No. 24 Jiwu Lane, Ximen Road, French Concession, of raping her underage daughter, Lingyu, who was under sixteen years old, causing her illness and death, and of raping her eldest daughter, Jinghua, while Lingyu was ill, and then abandoning her. They also accused Wan Guilin, the owner of No. 2 Zengrong Lane, Aigel Road, of inducing Lingyu to commit adultery with others, leading to her death. The defendants also retained lawyer Xu to defend them. The court has held four hearings, the details of which have been reported in previous newspapers. Yesterday, the court held another hearing. At 3:00 PM, Judge Li Changnian presided over the first criminal court and summoned the plaintiff mother and daughter and the two defendants to court. After asking about their names, ages, native places, addresses, and occupations, the judge asked Shi Chen and her daughter, "You have already stated the case against Wu Huaichun and others in the previous hearings. Is there anything else you want to say now?" Shi Chen and her daughter replied, "We have nothing else to say. We ask the judge to severely punish them." The judge then asked Shi Chen and her daughter what they were accusing Wu and others of, and asked them to briefly state the facts again. Shi replied that he raped her youngest daughter, Lingyu, causing her death, and raped and abandoned her daughter, Jinghua. "The last time Wan Guilin's concubine, Ms. Weng, insulted my sister in court, and now I want to sue her as well." The judge asked Shi and her daughter to state the facts of their accusation against Wu and others again, and asked whether they would state it themselves or have their lawyer state it for them. Shi and her daughter replied that they would like their lawyer to state it for them. The lawyer, Wu Peng, then stood up and stated in detail the circumstances of Lingyu being deceived by Wan Guilin to a brothel after coming to Shanghai, being raped by Wu Huaichun and falling ill, and being raped and abandoned by Jinghua. He also verbally requested to additionally accuse the third defendant, Wan Weng. After the statement, the court summoned the people from Wuling Apartment to testify, but they did not arrive yesterday. The plaintiff's lawyer, Hu Jue, stated that the people from Wuling Apartment were important witnesses and should be summoned for questioning. The judge asked Wan Guilin who opened the brothel at No. 2 Zengrong Lane. He replied that it was opened by Ms. Weng. She first opened it in Taihe Lane and then moved to No. 2 Zengrong Lane three or four years ago. The judge asked if Weng also came forward to report the donation to the Public Works Department. He replied that it was Ms. Weng who opened it, so of course Ms. Weng came forward. The judge said that after investigating with the Public Works Department, the reply was that a Mr. Wu came forward to report the donation. The judge then asked Wan Guilin if Ms. Weng had any other surnames. He replied that he did not know. The court then sent the Public Works Department's reply to the lawyers on both sides for review. At this point, Pan Chenge, the lawyer for the defendant Wu Huaichun, argued with the plaintiff's lawyer that two letters were missing from the evidence submitted by the plaintiff. The judge then asked Wu Huaichun if the letters were written by him. He replied that he asked a Mr. Shi to write them, and he stamped them with his seal. The judge held up a photo of Wu and Jinghua together and asked, "Why are Wu and Jinghua photographed together?" He replied, "Jinghua asked me to accompany her to take a photo. After she took a photo of herself, she asked me to take a photo with her as a souvenir for her unmarried concubine's sister." The judge then asked if the fan was this one. He replied, "No, there is another fan that was given to Jinghua." The judge asked, "What is your relationship with Lingyu and Jinghua?" He replied, "I have no physical relationship with either of them. I only met Lingyu and her mother at No. 2 Zengrong Lane when she was sick. Seeing her suffering in her illness, I took pity on them and helped them rent a house and get medical treatment. Later, I lent them 300 yuan to return to their hometown. After her death, her mother said she would give her to me as a concubine, but only as an unmarried concubine." The judge asked, "What do you mean by addressing Jinghua's fiancé as 'brother-in-law' in your letter to him?" He replied, "It is a polite way to address a friend." At this point, the judge asked both parties a question, and then ordered the opening of arguments. Lawyers Hu, Wu, and He for the plaintiff and lawyers Pan and Zhu for the defendant debated for a long time. The court announced the end of the arguments and scheduled the pronouncement of the sentence.</p>
<p>Fang Junnian's Family Dispute</p>
<p>Half Siblings Request Financial Assistance for Tuition and Living Expenses</p>
<p>The late Ningbo tycoon, Fang Dingfu, was a prominent figure in the sugar business in Shanghai during his lifetime, with renowned establishments such as Yuansheng Sugar Company on Taigu Road and Lianyi Sugar Company on Yangxing Street. Other ventures included Renheng Exchange and Ningbo Hefeng Rice Company, amassing substantial wealth. In his later years, his business was affected by war, but he still had assets of over 100,000 yuan, making him a reputable merchant. Early in his life, Dingfu took Xu Zhenzhu, a woman from his hometown, as his concubine, and she bore him one son and two daughters: Kangnian, Xiuzhen, and Xiuqing. Dingfu passed away in 1920, when Kangnian was still an infant. Ms. Xu endured hardship to raise her children, who have now grown up. The two daughters are of marriageable age, and Kangnian is about to come of age. However, Dingfu also had an eldest son, Junnian, who is now fifty years old. Relying on his father's legacy, he also enjoys a good reputation in the business world. After his father's death, he personally managed all the property rights and neglected his half-siblings. Ms. Xu is a traditional woman who deeply believes in the three obediences, and Junnian and his wife colluded to bully her. She endured without complaining, and they neglected to provide for her, relying entirely on her private savings to make ends meet. The mother and her orphaned children have suffered in silence. In recent years, as the cost of living has increased, her savings have long been depleted, and they are on the verge of starvation. Therefore, she explained her difficulties to Junnian in detail, hoping to receive support, but Junnian refused to listen. Friends and relatives tried to persuade him, but to no avail. Ms. Xu, unable to endure any longer, entrusted lawyer Li Zuyu to file a lawsuit. Junnian retained lawyers Zhang Shizhao and Wang Chuanbi to file a defense, arguing that Ms. Xu was not his father's concubine. Later, Zhuang Baoru and Wu Runfu testified in court, proving that Fang Dingfu and Ms. Xu rented a house together and had children. Kangnian's appearance was also identical to Dingfu's portrait. Based on this evidence, Judge Zhu Ganxuang ruled that Kangnian, Xiuqing, and Xiuzhen were indeed Dingfu's children. Ms. Xu, due to financial difficulties, forced Kangnian to drop out of school and work as a merchant. However, Kangnian and his sisters were eager to pursue their education. The siblings went to their elder brother to request assistance with living expenses and tuition, but they were all rejected. Kangnian and others, feeling that Junnian was so ungrateful, retained a lawyer to file a petition with the court to preserve their inheritance rights.</p>
<p>Anti-Japanese Member</p>
<p>Tian Siwei Accused of Raping a Dancer</p>
<p>Xia Pan, a woman from Huzhou residing at No. 101 Maigen Road, accused Tian Siwei, an anti-Japanese member residing at No. 25 Shanle Lane, Julai Road, French Concession, of seducing her 14-year-old daughter, Aibao, who dances at the New New Dance Hall, and forcibly raping her in Room 102 of the Great Shanghai Hotel in January of last year, and then abandoning her. The mother and daughter retained lawyers Wu Kaisheng, Ye Xiaobai, and Ma Hongyuan to file a criminal complaint with the Second Special District Court, accusing Tian of disrupting the family and requesting legal action, as well as filing a civil lawsuit to recover 20,000 yuan in compensation. The court accepted the complaint and held a hearing, but the defendant did not appear, so the case was postponed. The original complaint has been reported in previous newspapers. Yesterday afternoon, another hearing was held. Due to the large number of cases, Judge Wang presided over the first criminal court to continue the hearing until 6:00 PM. The defendant arrived with his defense lawyer. Because the case involved public morals, spectators were prohibited. The defendant denied the rape. The court ordered the defendant to provide a guarantee to be available whenever summoned, and the case was postponed for another hearing. New House Foundation Not Solid</p>

<p>Transferred from Wuxian County, Second Special District</p>
<p>The notorious robbers Li Wenming, Wen Bingrong, and Shen Hesheng robbed the Fulaide Electric Material Store on Chanmen Avenue, Suzhou, in broad daylight last month, obtaining stolen goods and fleeing to Shanghai. The Wuxian County Public Security Bureau offered a reward for their arrest, but they were not apprehended. After arriving in Shanghai, these bandits gathered their accomplices and stormed the Huasheng Electric Material Company on Yingda Road, Xiangfen Lane, at noon on the 23rd of last month, robbing 450 yuan with weapons and fleeing with the stolen goods. After a while, they were caught by detectives from the General Patrol Room and sent to the First Special District Local Court. After interrogation, Wen Bingrong was sentenced to six years of imprisonment, Li Wenming to thirteen years, and Shen Hesheng to nine years. During the sentencing on the day before yesterday, Cao Anchang, the captain of the detective team of the Wuxian County Public Security Bureau, brought Wen to the court, requesting that he be transferred. The judge ordered that since the two criminals Wen Bingrong and Shen Hesheng had committed similar robbery cases in the French Concession, they should be handed over to the French Patrol Room detectives to be interrogated first, and ordered the captain to go to the Second Special District Court to apply for the transfer. As for the criminal Li Wenming, he was allowed to be taken back to Suzhou by Captain Cao for interrogation. Therefore, Captain Cao took the criminal Li back to Suzhou by afternoon train yesterday and will prepare a document to come to Shanghai again to request the Second Special District Court to transfer Wen and Shen for joint trial.</p>
<p>Smuggling Opium Sentenced to Eight Months</p>
<p>Wang Jinsheng, an opium trafficker from Jiangyin, was surrounded by several Japanese ruffians at the entrance of Baifu Lane near Yad Road on Broadway Road around 2:00 PM on January 20th because he was carrying 18 pounds of opium hidden on his body. Patrolmen Nos. 1955 and 1990 rushed to the scene upon hearing the alarm and were also hindered and restrained by the crowd. In self-defense, Patrolman No. 1990 fired several shots, hitting Li Caifu, a Ningbo native, in the left arm, causing him to fall to the ground. Wang Jinsheng was arrested, and the opium was seized and taken to the Hongkou Police Station for detention. The injured person was sent to the hospital for treatment by the police. The next morning, the criminal Wang was sent to the First Special District Court for interrogation, and the details have been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Xiao Xiexuan continued the hearing in the third criminal court. Li Caifu had recovered from his injuries and was tried together with Wang. Lawyer Zhang Tianyin of the police station stated the previous events and said that during the detention, Wang Jinsheng claimed that the opium was sent by a person named Li Aji to hire a rickshaw to deliver to a certain place, or perhaps the second defendant Li Caifu was also involved. Wang Jinsheng was questioned, and his confession was vague. He insisted that the opium was not his and that he did not know Li Caifu, asking for judgment. Li Caifu testified that he saw many people surrounding the two Chinese patrolmen and went forward to watch, when he suddenly heard a gunshot hitting his left arm. He turned to flee, but his arm was hit again and he fell to the ground in extreme pain. He did not know anything about the opium and retained a lawyer to defend him. Judge Xiao sentenced Wang Jinsheng to eight months of imprisonment and a fine of 200 yuan. If he could not pay the fine, he would be imprisoned for one day for every three yuan. The number of days of detention would be deducted. Li Caifu was found not guilty.</p>

<h3>Establishment of a Joint Committee of Rice Transport Merchants</h3>
<p>A communiqué from Da Gong She reports that, in response to rice merchants and measuring officials applying heavy measures, rice transport merchants from both the northern and southern parts of the city have declared a strike. On the other hand, the measuring officials, due to the rice shops implementing a system of nested measures, are also requesting government relief. Yesterday at 4 PM, the striking transport merchants established a joint committee, sending telegrams to the Ministry of Industry in Nanjing and local party and government agencies, requesting a strict order to abolish the use of heavy measures. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Formation of the Joint Committee: Rice merchants, since declaring the strike, in order to concentrate their efforts and unanimously oppose the measuring officials' use of heavy measures and to implement fair measures with funnels, held a joint meeting of various guilds yesterday at 4 PM. Representatives from over forty guilds, including Nan Jiao, Qing Jiao, Bei Shi Pu, Xi Tang, Chong Gu, Zhang Yan, Kunshan, Wuxi, Changshu, Fengjing, Pingwang, Shengze, and Tongli, totaling more than sixty people, including Wu Fuhai, Zhang Fusheng, Ding Genhe, Dai Genbao, Jin Weixiang, Xia Tianhai, Qu Jinsheng, Jin Genda, and Li Genxiang, elected Chen Zhiqiang as chairman. The Joint Committee of Rice Transport Merchants was immediately established, and Chen Zhiqiang, Qu Jinsheng, Ren Jinquan, Wu Fuhai, Xia Tianfu, Zhang Fusheng, Dai Genbao, Jin Ada, Wang Asan, Zhang Liushou, Zeng Afu, Niu Guifu, Zhang Aqiu, Ding Genhe, Jin Weixiang, Lü Junwen, Shen Xiaowu, and Yao Zengda, a total of nineteen individuals, were elected as committee members and announced the committee's establishment on the same day.</p>
<p>Telegram to the Ministry of Industry: After the establishment of the committee, a telegram was immediately sent to the Ministry of Industry, stating: "To Minister Chen of the Ministry of Industry in Nanjing, we respectfully report that rice shops and measuring officials have been exploiting rice transport merchants with heavy measures for years, causing untold suffering. Last year, we jointly petitioned the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee and the Bureau of Social Affairs, requesting strict prohibition, but so far, no suitable measures have been taken. Rice transport merchants, under the heavy oppression of both merchants and measuring officials, find it impossible to survive. We are the fish and they are the knife, at their mercy. Therefore, the transport merchants, having reached the end of their patience, have no choice but to resort to this strike as a last resort, seeking fair criticism and determined to abolish heavy measures and implement fair measures with funnels. In addition to petitioning local party and government agencies for handling, we specifically telegram Your Ministry, urgently requesting prompt prohibition to alleviate the people's suffering and eliminate malpractices. The Joint Committee of Rice Transport Merchants bows in urgent expectation."</p>
<p>Petition to the Party and Government: The committee also submitted documents to the party and government agencies, stating:</p>
<p>"Regarding the petition for strict orders to promptly prohibit the use of heavy measures by rice shops and measuring officials, and to implement fair measures with funnels, in order to alleviate the people's suffering and eliminate malpractices. We respectfully report that rice shops and measuring officials have been exploiting the blood and sweat of transport merchants with heavy measures for years. Last year, we detailed this to Your (Ministry) (Bureau), requesting strict prohibition, and Your (Ministry) (Bureau) jointly mediated and prohibited this. However, the measuring officials are only concerned with their own selfish desires and disregard the suffering of the transport merchants, continuing to use heavy measures. When negotiated with, they even used force to suppress us. Therefore, our rice transport merchants, under the oppression of both merchants and measuring officials, have no justice to speak of, and have no choice but to resort to this painful strike. The committee is entrusted with the mission of the transport merchants. In addition to publicizing the malpractices of the measuring officials to the public, we are specifically submitting this urgent request to Your (Ministry) (Bureau), requesting strict prohibition for the public good. Respectfully submitted to the Municipal Party Committee and the Bureau of Social Affairs." Regarding the measuring official issue, after the rice merchants declared a strike, the rice shops also switched to using nested measures, resulting in the measuring officials being unable to profit and facing the possibility of losing their livelihood. Therefore, representatives were sent the other day to petition the Bureau of Social Affairs for relief. Zhou Minggang and Zhu Guilin from the Third and Fourth Sections were dispatched to mediate. Because the rice shops could not use the supervised measuring procedures, they decided to switch to the previously used nested measures. However, the measuring officials, not only losing their profits but also incurring heavy losses, opposed the switch to nested measures. The two sides' opinions diverged and were difficult to reconcile, so the mediation ended without result. Yesterday, Zhou Minggang, the person in charge of the Fourth Section of the Bureau of Social Affairs, once again advised both sides and investigated the truth of the rice merchants' strike in detail in order to handle the situation. Furthermore, according to Liu Longxiang, a standing committee member of the Measuring Officials' Union, who spoke to a reporter from Xin Sheng She yesterday, the measuring officials are in a difficult position regarding this dispute. Heavy measures will arouse the opposition of the transport merchants, while light measures will require the rice shops to demand compensation from the measuring officials. If the workers are unemployed, the rice shops will still make things difficult for them. The workers requested the rice shops to supervise the measuring, but this was opposed. As for nested measures, the measuring officials take the rice in measured baskets to each shop for a second measuring, but the nature of rice changes greatly with dryness and humidity, expanding and contracting significantly. The shop owners want nested measures, so the measuring officials have to measure the rice and retain some, but this is opposed by the merchants. If funnels are used, the workers will lose their livelihood, so the workers are determined to oppose funnels.</p>

<p>Pudong Native Place Association Solicitation of Charitable Donations</p>
<p>The Pudong Native Place Association has been soliciting donations to aid the Northeast Volunteer Army and refugees, collected by the Pudong Bank on its behalf. From July 16th of last year to January 15th of this year, a total of 13,633.18 yuan was collected. After remitting 13,600 yuan in seven installments, a balance of 33.18 yuan remained. From January 16th of this year to February 20th, an additional 505 yuan and five jiao in small foreign currency were collected, bringing the total, including the previous balance, to 538.18 yuan and five jiao in small foreign currency.

<p>Letter from the National Goods Factory United Association</p>
<p>Requesting Monthly Donations from All Factories to Aid the Volunteer Army</p>
<p>National Goods Exhibition to be Held in Jia District on Schedule</p>
<p>The Shanghai National Goods Factory United Association issued two letters to all member factories yesterday, as follows:</p>
<p>"To all workers, regarding donations to the Volunteer Army: Since the fall of Yu Pass and the subsequent loss of Jiukou, the Japanese bandits' ambition to seize Rehe is imminent, with heavy troops pressing the border. The Northeast Volunteer Army, fighting bloodily and sacrificing themselves one after another, is truly resisting with all their might. We, the people in the rear, are closely connected and cannot sit idly by. In January of this year, the Executive Committee of this Association decided to urge each factory to donate one day's wages per month, starting from January until the recovery of the lost territories in the Northeast. The factory should also donate an equal amount to match the total amount donated by the workers to aid the anti-Japanese forces in the Rehe area. This decision has been recorded and announced. However, as the end of the industrial and commercial year approaches, only a few factories have responded. The Executive and Supervisory Committees discussed this matter at a meeting on the 7th of this month and decided to send another letter to urge implementation as soon as possible. Therefore, we are writing to your esteemed factory again, requesting you to refer to the previous and current letters, and to urge and negotiate with the workers as soon as possible to ensure the implementation of this monthly donation. We eagerly await your reply.</p>
<p>"To all national goods factories, regarding the National Goods Mobile Exhibition: Regarding the proposal to hold a National Goods Mobile Exhibition in the six counties of the old Jia district, representatives of various national goods factories, Lu Xingzhuang and Ma Jisheng, were elected at a meeting on the 15th of this month to go to Jiaxing to discuss all matters. On the 20th of this month, representatives of the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association of the six counties of Jia district held a joint meeting in Jiashan, attended by Lu and Ma. It was officially decided to name the event the Old Jia District National Goods Mobile Exhibition and to hold the opening ceremony in Jiashan on March 7th, the opening ceremony in Jiaxing on March 21st, the opening ceremony in Haiyan on April 4th, and the opening ceremony in Pinghu on April 17th. The exhibition period for each county is tentatively set at ten days, with the aim of promoting national goods and regaining economic rights. It is now scheduled to convene the second representative meeting of various national goods factories at 2:00 PM on Friday, the 24th of this month, to elect directors for each division and to discuss all preparatory procedures. Therefore, we are writing to your esteemed factory, requesting you to refer to this letter, assign a responsible representative to attend the meeting on time, and hope that factories willing to participate will register with the Association as soon as possible to prepare. We eagerly await your response."</p>

On that day, the People's Corps and all schools will be closed, and Japanese residents will hang mourning flags to comfort the souls of the deceased.</p>
<p>British Consul General to Return Home on Schedule</p>

In addition, Baron Cornebray, the German Consul General in Shanghai, has also applied for leave to return to Berlin and will depart with his wife on March 2nd.</p>
<p>Summary of Shaanxi Disaster Relief</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese Jisheng Association, recognizing the extreme severity of the Shaanxi disaster, is currently operating a porridge kitchen in the provincial capital of Shaanxi. The Association has allocated 5,000 yuan and 300 sets of cotton clothing. Mr. Lu Hefu, the president of the Shaanxi Jisheng branch, is leading relief workers in setting up and operating the kitchen. The disaster situation in Wugong County, Shaanxi, is particularly severe. The Association has allocated 5,000 yuan in two installments to open a shelter, initially accommodating 200 people and later increasing the capacity to 1,000 people for a period of four months. According to reports, due to the extraordinary disaster in Wugong, funds were allocated for shelter, and either the number of art trainees could be increased, additional shelters established, or relief grain distributed. After consultation with colleagues, it was agreed that the disaster in Wu was even more severe than the previous year, with every household suffering from hunger and every family awaiting rescue. Children are abandoned on cliffs, daughters are drowned in rivers, beggars line the roads, and food has run out in villages. The number of people dying of starvation is countless. Those who survive are emaciated and groan with every step, exhausted to the extreme. Although receiving a few ounces of grain per day is helpful, how much can be saved? It is only possible to temporarily set up shelters to select good and extremely poor children, initially accommodating several hundred. Currently, the price of food, such as oats, is 1.5-1.6 yuan per dou, weighing 22-23 jin. Each person requires approximately 2 yuan per month. Relief for four months will last until the wheat harvest. Elderly, experienced, and virtuous individuals are invited to teach, provide daily instruction, and manage food and accommodation, to nurture the children and avoid mistakes. The location has been selected near Yanghua Garden in Beiguan and the original art training center, and it is scheduled to open on the twelfth day of the first lunar month in the twenty-second year of the Republic. As additional relief funds were received, extremely poor children will be added at any time for education and care. However, with disasters occurring year after year, countless people are starving to death. Once announced, the shelter will be overwhelmed, and people will arrive in droves, crying at the door from morning till night, lying on the ground and refusing to leave. Although colleagues are strong, they are deeply saddened and helpless. It is difficult to provide relief. The difficult situation should be understood. It is now known that grain prices are lower in the Nanshan area near Shaanxi. The disaster-stricken children sheltered in Wugong could be moved to eat, doubling the number of people who could be supported. It is unknown if this can be done. The Shaanxi Relief Association has no relief funds for both winter and spring relief. The Shanghai Chinese and Foreign Relief Association raised 30,000 yuan and transported 3,000 shi of grain, instructing the establishment of several shelters, each receiving 500 yuan or 1,000 yuan per month for a period of six months. Mr. Zhang Xianzhu and Lou Xiangqing from Tianjin raised funds for disaster-stricken children in Fufeng to operate a porridge kitchen. Mr. Lu Hefu, the president of the Shaanxi Jisheng branch, discussed with Wang Youlao and raised 15,000 yuan to establish a porridge kitchen in each of the three counties of Qian, Li, and Mei. If each kitchen is limited to 1,000 people, approximately 5,000 yuan will be needed until the wheat harvest. In Mei County, Mr. Tang Mufen and Rao Pingqing raised 5,400 yuan and sent Mr. Yang Shuzhi from Ping to Shaanxi to investigate and verify. Other counties have exhausted all options. Now, at the time between harvests, the disaster victims await rescue like waiting for rain clouds. The situation in Wugong is even more unspeakable. It is requested that the Association consider providing urgent assistance. The Association should answer how to provide shelter properly, as well as moving people to eat, with the goal of saving as many lives as possible. Flexible measures are acceptable. However, with the disaster situation so severe, the Association and various charities have limited funds. A drop in the bucket is not enough to save many. It is hoped that charitable individuals, with the spirit of compassion, will provide more assistance to save lives and create blessings, reducing the disaster to the greatest extent possible.</p>

<p>Letter to the Editor</p>
<p>Dear Editor, We are writing on behalf of our client, Li Yamin, who claims that he is the head of the reception and delivery section at the Shanghai Local Court Detention Center. On September 24th of last year, the Shanghai Local Court Criminal Division sentenced the gambling offender Chen Tugeng to a fine of 15 yuan, which was issued by the Procuratorate and handed over to the Detention Center for execution. On October 5th of the same year, his term of imprisonment in lieu of payment of the fine expired. At 9:00 AM on the 6th of that month, Bao Fuchen, the head of the registry section of the center, handed the execution warrant of said offender to our client. Coincidentally, there was another Chen Tugeng with the same name detained in the center for the crime of causing the death of Ling Jiannan through injury. Our client was careless for a moment and mistakenly identified the Chen Tugeng in the death by injury case as the Chen Tugeng in the gambling case who was serving imprisonment in lieu of payment of the fine and submitted him to the director of the same center, Bao Fuchen, who also released the offender without examination. On October 9th, when Wang Dexun, the warden, was requested to release the gambling offender Chen Tugeng who had not been released, the aforementioned error was discovered. After the Chief Prosecutor issued an investigation and indictment, the Criminal Division of the Local Court sentenced our client and others to imprisonment and detention of two months or 30 days, respectively, on January 10th of this year, in accordance with Article 172, Paragraph 2 of</p>

The team, led by Captain Wang Fengqi, arrived in Shanghai yesterday and reported on their work to the municipal party and government agencies and various public organizations, seeking guidance. Captain Wang Fengqi and team member Liu Keyou, among others, presented the team's official letter to the Liaoning-Jilin-Heilongjiang-Jehol Volunteer Army Support Association, reporting on their work.</p>
<p>Labor-Contractor Dispute at Yongchang Wharf in Pudong</p>
<p>Establishment of a Mediation Decision</p>
<p>Shanghai dockworkers have long suffered from the extra exploitation of deduction by contractors, making their lives difficult. They have repeatedly petitioned the dock business office to remove the deduction by contractors and allow workers to elect representatives to implement a self-accounting system. There have been several such cases. It has been investigated that in the case of workers at Yongchang Wharf in Pudong requesting self-accounting, the office has repeatedly convened both labor and contractor parties on the 11th and 18th of this month, and representatives from local party and government agencies were dispatched to the scene for mediation. As a result, a decision with thirteen articles was formally established. The most important content is that the workers elect four representatives, and the business office designates two people to be responsible for handling accounting and other matters free of charge, canceling the empty position of the accounting contractor and the bad practice of deducting five copper coins per package of goods unloaded, and adding the money to the workers' wages. Both the contractor and the workers at the wharf are very satisfied, and the result is satisfactory (the text of the decision is omitted). It is also reported that the office will follow this precedent to continue to resolve other dock-related accounting disputes.</p>

<h3>Reader's Advisory</h3>
<p>Where is the Way Out?</p>
<p>丨丨 Letter from Mr. Huang Rucheng of Wujin丨丨</p>
<p>Editor: I have a very serious dilemma that I would like to trouble you to answer. The details are as follows: Suppose a person, in a desperate situation, wants to abandon a family that they are unwilling and unnecessary to stay in for long, and travel far away. However, this person is young and inexperienced. After leaving home, they want to find a place to live, but they are at a loss and do not know where to go. This person has various accounting skills, but they are troubled by the fact that no one wants to hire them. This person also has a strong body and wants to join the army!!! Preferably to join the volunteer army to kill foreign enemies!! To serve on the battlefield, but they are troubled by the fact that there is no way to achieve this goal. This person also has a lot of strength and wants to become a worker, but they are also troubled by the fact that there is no way to achieve this goal. Even if there is a way to find work, people will definitely refuse to hire them because they have never done this kind of work before. What other paths are there for this person besides begging and suicide? Editor, I am now about to become this person. I must leave this family no matter what. But where is the way out? I have spent several days racking my brains, exhausting my efforts, and thinking about this difficult problem, but I cannot solve it. I have been reading your newspaper for a long time and know that your newspaper and your column are guides for social progress. Therefore, I cannot help but ask you to solve this serious dilemma! Please do not ask why I want to abandon this family, nor ask what kind of desperate situation I am in; just answer whether there is a place to live after leaving the family 丨丨 a place to solve the problem of food, clothing, and shelter 丨丨 that is: [Are there any accounting jobs 丨丨 that provide room and board 丨丨? Is there a way to join the army 丨丨 that provides room and board 丨丨? Is there a way to become a worker 丨丨 that provides room and board 丨丨? ·····Are there any other paths?] with a concrete answer to solve my very serious dilemma.</p>
<p>Answer: The writing in your letter is clear and powerful, which shows that you are a diligent and ambitious young man. To answer your question, let us first give a simple answer: There are accounting jobs, there is a way to join the army, there is a way to become a worker, and there are all kinds of other paths. But one thing: although there are all kinds of paths, you cannot simply step onto them as soon as you go outside; first, you must have a spirit of adventure, be bold, and first leave that cage 丨丨 family 丨丨 and then we can talk; second, you must also have a firm determination, otherwise, if you suffer a little setback, you will complain and sigh, or you will not be able to withstand the pressure of the environment and suddenly have suicidal thoughts. If you do not think you have this kind of ambition, then do not try it lightly. The reporters of this column can only contribute their views based on the situation of society and theoretical grounds. Unfortunately, we are not a job placement agency, nor are we a base for recruiting soldiers, let alone a factory that accepts hired workers, so it is difficult to give a real "concrete answer."</p>

<h3>National Products Forum: The Rural Problem in the National Products Movement</h3>
<p>— Pan Yang'an</p>
<p>Where do the raw materials for national products come from?</p>
<p>Where is the vast market for national products?</p>
<p>In this national products movement, we cannot fail to pay attention to these two issues, and the only answer is that because two-thirds of China's land is rural and 85% of the people are farmers, the national products movement, which is mainly based on industry and commerce, cannot ignore the countryside and farmers!</p>
<p>However, when we look back at the current rural areas in our country, because of natural disasters, man-made disasters, banditry, and epidemics, they have been severely ravaged. From the frequently devastated Northwest to the so-called paradise of Jiangnan, where is not full of scars! In Henan and Shaanxi, there is no smoke for hundreds of miles, and the organization of rural areas has been completely destroyed. How is it possible to produce raw materials for national products from these places? Even cotton and wheat have to be bought in large quantities from foreign countries. If we want to promote national products in these trampled rural areas, the number of farmers with purchasing power in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, which are not far from Shanghai, has gradually decreased, and in Anhui, Jiangxi, Hunan, and Hubei, they have become as rare as phoenix feathers and unicorn horns. Therefore, in this national products movement, coinciding with the decline of rural areas to an extreme degree, we cannot but pay attention to the rural problem and the problem of rural economic recovery for the sake of raw materials and a vast market.</p>
<p>Because national products made from foreign raw materials (except for chemical products without substitutes) are not the national products we need: moreover, because if there are no rural areas that can be sold to, overproduction will also befall this budding stage of the national products production industry. This has indeed formed a serious situation, which not only makes our national products production industry have to pay attention to, but also makes us have to jointly seek remedies for ourselves and for others!</p>
<p>Recently, Mr. Zhang Gongquan said: "The problem of supporting rural areas is more urgent than the problem of supporting industry and commerce today!" The attention of the financial community to the rural problem is evident from this. But do our national products industrialists and businessmen allow the source of these raw materials and the sales of goods to naturally decline and disappear?</p>
<p>Discussion</p>
<h3>A Crucial Issue That Should Be Paid Attention to First in the National Products Year</h3>
<p>— Chen Datang</p>
<p>Promoting national products is not enough to just shout slogans; we must replace foreign goods with our own goods to be effective, which is known to everyone. Our own goods, agricultural products from the fields of our country, and manufactured goods from the factories of our country, need no detailed discussion. However, our country's industry is young, production is backward, and factories have not yet been established everywhere. There are only a few trading ports, and Shanghai is the most important of these trading ports. Therefore, Shanghai, as a single place, is the center of the national industry, and its prosperity or decline affects the economic activity of the whole country. Therefore, I believe that the first thing that should be paid attention to at the beginning of this National Products Year is not to open more national products exhibitions, nor to publish several more national products special issues in newspapers, nor to invite several celebrities to give speeches, but to address the issue of the survival of Shanghai's national products factories after the January 28th Incident.</p>
<p>Looking back at Shanghai's national products factories, during the European War, they had a brief period of prosperity due to a temporary opportunity. After the war, they gradually declined. In the past two or three years, they have been attacked by the world economic crisis and suffered from internal natural disasters and man-made disturbances, so not only has there been no progress, but there has also been an increase in decline. For example, there were more than 110 silk factories in the city, but at the end of 1931, only a few were able to operate, which is the most obvious example. Moreover, when the January 28th Incident occurred last year, the war zone happened to be in the Zhabei, Wusong, and Jiangwan areas, where our national products factories were concentrated. As a result of the bombing and fires, almost none of the factories in the war zone survived. According to Mr. Tian Heqing's speech published in the "Current Affairs News" on December 31st of last year, "Factories in the Changan Road area of Zhabei, except for stray bullets, did not suffer other losses. For example, factories in Baoshan Road, Yokohama Road, Yongxing Road, Zhonghua Road, Tiantong'an Road, as well as Jiangwan, Wusong, and other places, are almost all bankrupt, totaling more than 400 factories. Among them, the Commercial Press alone suffered a loss of 50 million yuan, and the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company also suffered a loss of about 10 million yuan. The remaining cotton cloth factories, yarn factories, and other departments suffered a loss of at least 200 million yuan. After the end of the war, for several months, although some of these more than 400 factories still tried their best to reorganize, they were too badly damaged to reorganize easily. Therefore, there were very few factories that resumed operations after the war. Can you not be alarmed by this? However, this is only in the war zone. If you add the business interruption and indirect losses suffered outside the war zone, how can the losses be counted? If there is an accurate statistical survey, I am afraid that all the essence of our national industry has been cut off. If you don't believe me, please check the various industries again. For example, in the first half of 1931, the number of spindles stopped in the yarn industry was no more than 490,155. In the first half of last year, it increased to 2,338,536. As of mid-October, only 45 silk factories had resumed work, and by the end of November, only two Shuang Gong silk factories in the country, Fulun and Honglun, had announced their closure. The tobacco industry was reduced from 64 to 60. The rest of the smaller national products industries, such as toothbrush factories, match factories, soap factories, hat factories, enamel factories, cosmetic factories, condiment industries, rubber industries, etc., as mentioned in the 4th issue of the 5th volume of the China Bank Monthly, are either in poor business, or have financial obstacles, or plan to reduce their scope, or prepare to close down. All of this clearly shows the decline of the national products industry. Promoting national products requires the supply of national products, but the factories that supply national products have been defeated to this point after the Shanghai war. If we do not provide relief, what will we use to meet the needs of the people when promoting national products? Therefore, at the beginning of this National Products Year, I specially propose the "Survival of Shanghai's National Products Factories After the January 28th Incident," a crucial issue, to tell all of you who are promoting national products that the revival of Shanghai's national products factories is a prerequisite for promoting national products, and I hope that we can work together to seek development in this direction. Written on January 3rd at the National Shanghai College of Commerce.</p>
<p>New Industry Introduction</p>
<h3>Introduction to Domestic Cement</h3>
<p>— He Kou</p>
<p>Cement is currently the most important and common material in construction. Recently, the invention of reinforced concrete has made it exceptionally strong, so the use of cement is becoming increasingly widespread. Countries in Europe, America, and Japan have a long history of cement manufacturing. Because of the lack of scientific development and the lack of industrial and commercial prosperity in our country, it only began in the 27th year of Guangxu. Fortunately, the founders worked hard, and the successors continued to advocate for it. Today, the products are of excellent quality and the results are remarkable. Most of the cement used in domestic construction is now taken from domestic sources, which is a good phenomenon. Here, I would like to introduce the cement factories run by Chinese people and their products:</p>
<p>(1) Qixin Cement Company: Founded in the 27th year of Guangxu, it is the pioneer of self-operated cement factories in our country. The factory is located in Tangshan, Hebei Province, with convenient transportation. It has a capital of four million taels. The annual output is 1.3 million barrels (375 pounds per barrel). The trademark is the Horse brand. It is transported and sold to northern China, Shanghai, Fuzhou, Hong Kong, and the Nanyang Islands, and is the most developed cement factory in China today.</p>
<p>(2) Huaji Hubei Cement Company: Established in the second year of Xuantong, it started operations in four years and suffered heavy losses, so it was merged into Qixin Company. The factory is located in Hubei Daye, with an annual output of 550,000 barrels. The trademark is the Pagoda brand. It is transported and sold to central China, Jiujiang, Anqing, and Shanghai, with a capital of one million taels.</p>
<p>(3) China Cement Company: Organized in the tenth year of the Republic of China and started operations in the thirteenth year. The initial capital was 10,000 yuan. Now it is very large, with both dry and wet factories. The factory is located in Longtan Town, Jiangsu Province, with extremely convenient transportation. The annual output is 750,000 barrels, ranking second in China's cement manufacturing industry. The trademark is the Taishan brand. It is transported and sold to the Yangtze River area, as well as Shanghai and Guangzhou.</p>
<p>(4) Guangzhou Cement Factory: Located in the east of Guangzhou City, on the south bank of the Pearl River, it was established in the 34th year of Guangxu by the Qing government. After the founding of the Republic of China, it was transferred to the Guangdong Provincial Government. There are now new factories being added, and the scale is gradually increasing. The total annual output is 550,000 barrels. The trademark is the Five Rams brand. It is transported and sold to southern China.</p>
<p>(5) Haihe Cement Company: Located in Longhua, Shanghai, it has convenient transportation by water via the Huangpu River and by land via the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway. It was established in the seventh year of the Republic of China, with a capital of two million yuan. The trademark is the Elephant. The annual output is 500,000 barrels; it is transported and sold to the eastern provinces of our country. It is the first factory after Qixin and China.</p>
<p>(6) Jinan Cement Company: Located in Jinan, Shandong Province, it is very small in scale, with a capital of only 200,000 yuan. It produces approximately 100,000 barrels per year, which is only enough to supply local and nearby counties. (7) Taihu Cement Company: Prepared in the tenth year of the Republic of China, the factory is located in Wuxi, with a capital of 1.5 million yuan. It can produce 400,000 barrels per year. Details are unknown.</p>
<p>The above seven are all companies run by Chinese people. The total annual output of the country is 4.15 million barrels. Other Shandong Cement Company in Qingdao, Kowloon Cement Company in Hong Kong, Qingzhou Cement Company in Macau, and Haiphong Cement Company in Annam, although their factories are located in our country, are not operated by our people, so they are not included here.</p>
<p>Interview Record</p>
<h3>The Huasheng Electric Appliance Factory and Mr. Ye Youcai (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Qia Cheng</p>
<p>In backward China, there is actually a company engaged in the manufacture of electrical appliances, and it can manufacture generators and electric fans by itself. This news may be exciting for us! The intelligence and intellect of the Chinese people are not inferior to others. The success of Huasheng Electric Appliance Factory and Mr. Ye Youcai is not accidental, but only due to the perseverance and spirit of 15 years of struggle.</p>
<p>Mr. Tianran mentioned in the previous issue Mr. Yang Jichuan, who invented the electric fan as an apprentice in a foreign cloth shop, and who is one of the founders of Huasheng. After he and Mr. Ye Youcai made two electric fans from ideal to reality, they felt that domestic electrical appliances at that time were all foreign goods, and Mr. Ye felt even more so because he was working at the Weiling Foreign Company, which was the first to sell electrical appliances. Therefore, they founded the Huasheng Factory with Mr. Yuan Zongyao, laying the foundation in January of the fifth year of the Republic of China at Yokohama Bridge on North Sichuan Road. The initial Huasheng Factory only rented a few rooms and employed six or seven workers. Due to cost and talent considerations, it could only manufacture electrical limit tables, electrical ammeters, and electrical voltmeters. The three founders of Huasheng, Mr. Ye, Mr. Yang, and Mr. Yuan, all operated themselves. However, the factory that is now known as China's first electrical appliance manufacturing industry was tested and planned in this small-scale organization. Before Huasheng Factory manufactured electric meters, the market was full of foreign goods, and the price was more than ten taels. After Huasheng opened, it adopted the principle of low price and good quality, and the price per piece was only five taels, so sales were very good, and the factory gradually expanded after half a year, from six or seven workers to forty or fifty people. However, in commercial competition, the dumping policy of foreigners is very vicious. Because of the good sales of Huasheng electric meters, foreign goods also competed at low prices, to the point where electric meters were sold below the cost of two taels. This was indeed a poisonous scheme by foreign merchants to suppress China's emerging industries. In the fierce commercial warfare, Huasheng, which was in its infancy, felt somewhat困顿 due to cost considerations. However, this is where one must admire Mr. Ye's perseverance and spirit. They were not only squeezed out by foreign goods, but instead began to manufacture generators and transformers.</p>
<p>This was the beginning of China's self-made generators. Because Huasheng adhered to its consistent policy of low price and good quality, the machines that foreign goods sold for 2,000 taels at that time only cost 1,000 taels at Huasheng. The market that foreign goods thought they could monopolize was once again hit. Foreign electrical appliance merchants naturally resisted as always, and repeatedly reduced prices to fight, even selling machines that cost 2,000 taels for 600 taels. This was the second time Huasheng and foreign goods fought a bloody battle.</p>
<p>Although electric fans were the organizational motivation for the Huasheng Factory, and Mr. Ye Youcai and Mr. Qingchuan continued to explore and modify them every year, they were not launched until after the successful test in the 12th year of the Republic of China. After the Huasheng electric fan was launched, 1,000 units were sold in the same year. Later, because its own products guaranteed its reputation, the number sold last year reached more than 25,000 units. The price is only one-quarter of that of foreign goods, and it can be used for a long time without breaking down, so the Huasheng electric fan has completely overcome foreign countries in the domestic market, and the trade volume has reached a ratio of nine to one. This is certainly the success of Huasheng and the success of Mr. Ye Youcai, but at a time when national products are everywhere suppressed by foreign goods, Huasheng can raise its eyebrows and exhale for the national products production industry, which is really commendable. Moreover, from the development history of Huasheng, we have been given a lesson that with the perseverance and spirit of struggle, there is always the possibility of success!</p>
<h3>National Products News: The National Products Movement in the Women's World</h3>
<p>— Qia Cheng</p>
<p>Since Mr. Yang called out repeatedly in this journal, the enlightened women of Shanghai have risen up and worked hard for the national products movement. When I drove to participate in the family friendship meeting hosted by the Home Renovation Association of the Family Daily News Association, although I felt daunted because I was participating in social interaction for the first time, I was still very excited to visit the women's movement in the National Products Year.</p>
<p>I was the first person to arrive and sat in the corner watching Zhu Wang Huanqing personally arrange the venue. I was also the last person to leave and stood by the door watching groups of participants leave the venue. Therefore, this friendship meeting, which was based on the family as a unit, was engraved in the mind of this loner.</p>
<p>If I were to describe the venue, the reception room of Shangxian Hall was filled with pairs of couples and their offspring. The long table was filled with bowls of candy, coats and hats were hung on the walls, and the fire in the stove melted the hearts of everyone in the room. There was no arguing, only laughter. The ladies and gentlemen were chatting with their friends, and the friends were happily eating candy.</p>
<p>The speakers refused to give up their positions. Liu Wang Liming spoke about birth control, and Wang Zhixin spoke about family economics, narrating important issues in a humorous tone. After everyone had tea and snacks, they talked about the main issues of national products and frugality, and everyone decided on four covenants:</p>
<p>(1) All families who join this association must use national products for daily necessities such as clothing and food. (2) All families who join this association must use national products for dishes and dishes when hosting banquets, and the cost per table must not exceed ten yuan. (3) All families who join this association must be frugal in seasonal gifts, celebrations, condolences, and New Year's money for children, and it is best to use gift certificates from national products companies, and the amount should not exceed one yuan. (4) All families who join this association must establish a budget and final account, and first investigate and strictly examine the needed supplies. If it is found that there are still non-national products, efforts should be made to find national products to replace them.</p>
<p>Afterwards, the association printed the full text of this covenant and distributed it to the people in each family, using the method of督促 by the gentry to establish several exemplary national products families. This may be the light of a star, but it is the beginning of light. With the efforts of many enthusiastic housewives and ladies, this warm friendship meeting will naturally have the hope of being promoted and carried forward. Therefore, in the drizzle, I walked on the street and embarked on my way home, still holding warm hope.</p>
<h3>Minimum Requirements for National Goods Store Staff</h3>
<p>— Ai Wu</p>
<p>1.  Treat all customers, regardless of the size of their purchase, their wealth or status, their age, gender, or appearance, as if they were providers of food and clothing, and serve them with utmost diligence. Even if the price of the goods does not meet the customer's expectations and the transaction cannot be completed, do not show any signs of displeasure. Hope that they will come again next time.</p>
<p>2.  Be lively and generous in demeanor, neither slick nor dull, so that customers do not feel uncomfortable.</p>
<p>3.  When encountering rude customers, still use a humble approach to move them, and never argue with them.</p>
<p>4.  Be very familiar with the raw materials, manufacturing advantages, and other aspects of all kinds of goods, and be able to carry out practical, concise, and effective promotion at any time and in any place.</p>
<p>To achieve the above four basic requirements, it is natural to start with training. Then, supplementary education for store staff is of utmost urgency. I advise the managers of national goods stores to have a long-term vision. The improvement of store staff's knowledge, abilities, and morality will directly affect service efficiency. Spending a small amount of money on supplementary education for store staff now will bring great benefits in business in the future.</p>

<h3>How Should National Goods Survive Under Heavy Oppression? (5)</h3>
<p>— Du Chongyuan</p>
<p>In the horizontal aspect: (1) Factories must improve and use scientific management methods to rationalize production. This is the best method for factory facilities recognized by all advanced countries in the world. Not only can production be increased and products refined as a result, but also costs can be reduced. The Soviet Union has rapidly changed from an agricultural country to an industrial country. They also adopted this method of rationalizing production in factories, completing their five-year plan ahead of schedule. (2) Eliminate jealousy among peers and carry out industry alliances. In today's era of extreme political and economic pressure from imperialists, the whole country should unite as one to have strength against the outside world. In particular, industries have a relationship of shared weal and woe, and they should work together in harmony. Furthermore, not only should they eliminate jealousy among peers, but also take a further step: each industry must organize a cooperative to handle all matters related to this industry, both external and internal. For example, joint procurement can reduce costs, joint sales can balance prices, and joint research institutes can be organized to jointly study equipment improvement and product improvement based on the conditions of each factory. In terms of raw materials, domestic products should be used as much as possible, and the most important thing is to pay close attention to the social situation and whether one's own actions are appropriate.</p>
<p>There is also one point that must be paid special attention to: Chinese farmers account for more than 80% of the country's population, so the sales of national goods must rely on farmers. However, since the economic penetration of imperialists into rural areas, the rural economy has been declared bankrupt. In addition, major disasters have followed one after another. For example, last year's floods affected a total of 16 provinces and regions, with a population of over 50 million people affected. Even in the southeastern provinces, which are known for their wealth, rice riots occurred several times in Wuxi, the most prosperous industrial area in Jiangsu, in May and June of this year. Furthermore, in the previous two or three months, farmers in Yangzhou County, Jiangsu Province, gathered and crowded into the county government to protest against taxes, showing the intensification of the rural economic panic. However, on the other hand, in provinces such as Yunnan, Guizhou, Sichuan, and Xinjiang, due to inconvenient transportation, large quantities of food and raw materials are burned every year, while several southeastern provinces suffer from food shortages every year and purchase large quantities of food and raw materials from foreign countries. The number of imports increases significantly every year. For example, the import volume of rice in 1931 was 63,805,931 customs taels, which was the highest number of rice imports in history. Although the southeastern provinces were fortunate enough to have a bumper harvest last year, rice prices plummeted, and the value of the output from one mu of land was not enough to cover the cost of fertilizer. At this time, the government still purchased large quantities of food from foreign countries. Under this abnormal state, how can they even take care of their own stomachs, let alone care whether consumers are using foreign goods or national goods? Of course, they only seek cheapness. Last year, the boycott of Japanese goods was carried out vigorously, but according to the Japanese Ministry of Finance, the import volume of Japanese goods still reached 258,046,000 yen, which was worth more than 500 million yuan in national currency at the exchange rate at that time. Some money that remained in the broken rural areas also moved to the cities; but what about the cities? The cities are also in panic. Taking Shanghai, the center of the country's financial system, as an example, on Nanjing Road, the most prosperous commercial street, banners with blood-red and large characters such as [Great Bargain] [Great Auction] [Great Sacrifice] flutter in our eyes all year round. Isn't the pathological state of urban economic panic fully displayed in front of us? Therefore, if we really want national goods to embark on a path to survival, we should fundamentally understand that a one-sided approach can never achieve the goal, and we must start from many aspects. That is, to make national goods sell well, we must increase the purchasing power of the people, and to increase the purchasing power of farmers, we must relieve the rural areas. According to this theory, manufacturers and financial capitalists should unite. On the one hand, they should provide assistance to the rural economy and organize rural consumer cooperatives to reduce the burden of exploitation by merchants. On the other hand, they should transport out the raw materials and food that are stagnant in the rural areas. They should also take on the responsibility of improving rural areas, improving farmers' education, and instilling in them all kinds of scientific farming methods. They must know that directly helping rural areas is indirectly helping themselves. This is the real way out for national goods, the real way out for Chinese national industry, and the real way out for the Chinese nation.</p>

<p>National Goods Talk</p>
<h3>Pitiful Leak of These 500 Million Taels</h3>
<p>— Qia Cheng</p>
<p>How many men and women in Shanghai are dominated by foreign goods, so that some weak-willed shop assistants do not hesitate to shamelessly speak of the benefits of foreign goods. How shameful this is! After the September 18th Incident, someone loudly called out that using enemy goods is equivalent to using bombs, but the term "foreign goods" still has not left the mouths of Shanghai people.</p>
<p>The airplanes and cannons of the January 28th Incident, large batches of foreign goods arrived in Shanghai. The scarred remains of Jiangwan, Zhabei, and Wusong are all the taste of foreign goods; this inexplicable and bitter taste is naturally the specialty of foreign goods. Have the people of Shanghai perhaps tasted enough? Some people lament the huge losses of the Shanghai war, but in the customs trade report, these foreign goods, which are constantly on the lips of modern women and beautiful shop assistants, have long been drawing 500 million taels from our country's economy, which is on the verge of blood loss, every year; who will pay attention to this bloodless killing method!</p>
<p>Please try foreign goods, the bloodstains and sparks of the January 28th Incident, the cannon fire of Shanhaiguan, and the leak of 500 million taels every year!</p>
<p>Phenomena in the Voice of National Goods Jiang Zhong ·</p>
<p>Our She County · is in the midst of thousands of mountains, but the culture is not very backward. I am just a primary school student and do not have the qualifications to publish opinions in this publication; but at this point, I cannot help but say a few words:</p>
<p>[Promote National Goods] [Down with Japanese Goods] [····] [···]</p>
<p>Most of these are said and written by public officials. In particular, they (referring to public officials) eat Japanese goods and wear Japanese goods: just say that when they hold memorial meetings, they insist on using Dongyang paper to write slogans, print declarations, smoke foreign cigarettes, wear foreign suits, ····</p>
<p>As long as their wives and young ladies open their mouths, no matter what kind of enemy goods they are, they will find a way to defend them. Alas, how pitiful, how lamentable.</p>
<h3>National Goods Introduction Center and Production and Sales Cooperation</h3>
<p>— Zhou Chengxun</p>
<p>The National Goods Introduction Center was created as a consequence of the Production and Sales Cooperation Association. Although the progress made in the past few months has not yet shown significant results, judging from its own organization, significance, and steps, it is not far from the true effectiveness of [Production and Sales Cooperation].</p>
<p>In order to address the unreliability of traditional brokers and the impossibility of factories widely establishing distribution agencies, the National Goods Introduction Center began to be established based on the principle of [Production and Sales Cooperation]. In order to explain the mission it bears and expect its success, the following points of principle are worth paying attention to: (1) Receive the benefits of division of labor and cooperation. With national goods introduction centers in various ports, factories can offload some of their energy used in business promotion to the National Goods Introduction Center, and focus on reforms and progress in their work. Isn't this more convenient and simple than the increased personnel expenses of factories establishing their own distribution offices everywhere? (2) Exchange commercial information and market conditions at any time. As mentioned above, it is impossible for factories to establish distribution agencies everywhere, so it is extremely difficult to know the sales trends and consumer changes in various places based on the mouths of brokers or the addition of goods in letters. The National Goods Introduction Center recruits thoughtful talents, organizes a sound system, and takes a completely cooperative pace with factories, so that it can often exchange information and report situations. The factories then have a direction to choose.</p>
<p>(3) Conscious advertising and publicity. Most of the commercial firms in various places are engaged in business for profit, not to develop national goods. Therefore, the recognition of national goods by the people in the inland is really shallow. The National Goods Introduction Center shoulders this heavy responsibility and strives to inject the image of national goods into the minds of the people in a concrete way, using thoughtful methods to reform the inherent bad habits of old-fashioned commercial firms. (4) Eliminate all bad debt losses. In the current commercial arena, bad news of the closure of certain groups or the debts owed by certain groups is often heard, making all factories regard granting credit to brokers as a dangerous path. Although, on the side of the commercial firms, there are indeed many reasons that cannot be recovered by human effort, but the irrationality of the business policy and the lack of careful observation are also sufficient to promote this phenomenon. The commercial firms themselves suffer losses, and the factories are also affected by bad debts. The National Goods Introduction Center is fundamentally different from ordinary commercial firms. It has a close chain relationship with the factories. It uses flexible methods and has sound and accurate methods to avoid the invasion of bad debts, and it is not comparable to the ordinary commercial firms that only seek profit and recklessly grant credit. Factories have one more guarantee, and the markets in various places are also indirectly stabilized.</p>
<p>Of course, there are many other principles related to the National Goods Introduction Center that can promote [Production and Sales Cooperation]. I have not thought of them, but from the perspective of a national goods factory and the National Goods Introduction Center working together for several months, I feel that the above points are enough to be effective.</p>
<p>There are very few National Goods Introduction Centers established in various places at present. We hope that in the near future, we can see the sign of the National Goods Introduction Center erected everywhere.</p>
<p>National Goods News</p>
<h3>Guangzhou Exhibition</h3>
<p>In order to develop municipal facilities and promote the improvement of industry and commerce, Guangzhou held the Guangzhou Exhibition from February 15th of this year. The honorary chairman is Lin Yunkai, and the chairman is Liu Jiwen. The conference paid special attention to the collection of national goods. Factories in Shanghai have received letters requesting exhibits. It is reported that well-known national goods factories in Shanghai, such as China Chemical Industry Society, Huasheng Electric Appliance Factory, Zhonghua Enamel Factory, and Wuhe Weaving Factory, have dispatched personnel to Guangdong to display their products. The following is an excerpt from the declaration: Guangzhou is located on the coast and has four major rivers. The railway lines branch out, and the agricultural and industrial products are abundant. The water and land transportation is even more convenient. Therefore, for domestic commercial trade, Guangdong goods circulate in various provinces and cities. For world economic contact, this city is the national pioneer. According to the economic history of this city, the navigation of the Portuguese to Macau began in the thirty-sixth year of Jiajing in the Ming Dynasty, and the establishment of the [Cohong] in Guangzhou City had already begun before the Opium War. This long history is created by the superior economic geography. From the perspective of the economic status of this city, among the 106 commercial ports in the country, which are summarized in 49 customs, the Yuehai Customs representing Guangzhou often ranks second or third in the total tax revenue of imports and exports every year. The reason for this is that, in addition to the direct trade between the three rivers in the east, west, and north of this province and the commercial cities in the south, and the coastal and Yangtze River provinces, there are special economic contacts with countries such as Hong Kong, Macau, the American Philippines, the British Australia, and the four French, Siamese, British, and Dutch islands of Nanyang, and Japanese Taiwan and Korea (others not directly connected are not included). This city already has this excellent economic environment, so the creation of a special status is not accidental. As for the local products in various parts of the province, such as silk from Shunde, oil from Conghua, tobacco from Heshan, iron from Qujiang, coal from Lechang, indigo from Beihai, ceramics from Shiwan, straw mats and sugarcane from Dongguan, pottery and tea from Chaozhou, tin from Huiyang, Baoan, Dongguan, Lechang, and Lianxian, and bismuth and manganese from the East, West, and North Rivers, the abundance of their output is enough to be surprising. Therefore, it is not an exaggeration to say that our Guangdong has a natural treasure house.</p>
<p>Now that our Guangdong has these abundant products and this city has a superior position, the prosperity of foreign trade can be expected. However, since the beginning of the Republic of China, the number of import surpluses in the international trade of this city has always reached 40 to 50 million yuan. Although the reasons for this may be due to the impact of the Industrial Revolution in Europe and the United States, and the encroachment of capitalism, the lack of perseverance and poor planning of those who run industries are also the reasons for their failure. In the world of commercial warfare, combatants are workers and merchants, and combat equipment is machinery and various goods. A country that can refine these combatants and improve this combat equipment can survive in the world; otherwise, its country will rarely be eliminated. We are in awe of this meaning, so we want to gather agricultural and industrial products such as agricultural tools, animal husbandry, planting, silk, field materials, agricultural products, dyeing and weaving, chemical, food and beverage, machinery, electrical appliances, handicrafts, medicine, and industrial materials, regardless of whether they are products of the city or products of the country, in one place to see which are good, which are inferior? Which should be improved? Which should be refined? Which should be operated by the state? Which should be organized by the people? We must make this conference a treasure house of industrial knowledge, sufficient for the practical experience and research of operators, so that we can achieve the effect of observation and reach the period of development. This is also the intention of this conference. Sun Yat-sen said: [Developing wealth is better than revitalizing industry]. He also said: [Guangzhou is not only the commercial center of southern China, but also the largest city in China. Until modern times, Guangzhou was the largest city in the Pacific Ocean and the commercial center of Asia]. We cherish this meaning, so we organized the Guangzhou Exhibition Preparatory Committee to collect items for presentation, and will open the meeting in Yuexiu Mountain on February 15th next year, to establish a model for revolutionary construction and seek the target for the improvement of goods. The prosperity of this capital, the prosperity of industry and commerce, and the promotion of the revolution can be expected. We hope that enthusiastic patriots and industrial magnates will send us goods and show us the itinerary, so that the government can have resources, things can be learned from, and there will be no wasted materials and no secrets hidden in the land. It will not only be the glory of this city, but also the benefit of China.</p>
<p>Editor's Note</p>
<p>Promoting Local Products Today in China, advocating for national goods, everywhere feels stretched, looking as if one cannot be self-sufficient. So, called promoting national goods, there are times one cannot help but sell foreign goods instead. Thus, some people advocate [Rather than promoting national goods, better to promote local goods.] Mr. Liu Wanong sent a letter hoping this publication would dedicate a special column to introducing [local goods], an idea the editor greatly agrees with, hoping for many contributions from readers.</p>
<p>National Goods Balloon Rubber balloons have traditionally been enemy goods, and there are two kinds: one with a blowing nozzle, commonly called a "foreign bubble," and one filled with light gas, tied with string at the bottom, able to rise into the air, which is a light gas balloon. Both are cherished items for children during the New Year. According to customs records, annual imports can reach 120,000 yuan. The gifts given at the opening of the China National Goods Company this time are domestic goods, self-made by the Jinxing Craft Factory on Sichuan Road. However, everyone should be careful, the ones printed with [Great China Fuchang] are said to be inferior goods.</p>
<p>Homespun Cloth After this publication previously carried a description of the benefits of homespun cloth, some readers enquired. One, Zhu Shisheng, living at No. 10 Dadian Lane, Julu Road, sent a letter, requesting this publication to introduce him to talk with Shan Yan. According to Zhu, he has an extremely effective method for promoting homespun cloth. This is very good news. I think it would be good to introduce Mr. Huang to contact Zhu, and any who are engaged in the homespun cloth business are also welcome to contact him.</p>
<p>Remembering Mr. Xiang Mr. Xiang Songmao, manager of Wuzhou Pharmaceutical Company in the national goods field, has been missing for over a year. All who admire Mr. Xiang are foolishly hoping that he escaped and returns to serve the national goods field together. However, the news remains silent, truly sigh-worthy. Yesterday, at the desk of his son, Mr. Xiang Shengwu, I saw a self-encouraging couplet that Mr. Xiang wrote before his disappearance, extremely generous and open-minded, unexpectedly becoming a lament, causing me to put down my pen and sigh three times. The couplet says: In ordinary times, one should reduce desires and nourish life; in great crises, one should understand life and entrust destiny.</p>
<p>To manage a home, one must measure income and spend accordingly; to sacrifice for great righteousness, one should regard thousands of gold as mere mustard seeds.</p>

<p>Geng Funds Payment Delayed</p>
<p>Affects Tsinghua Funding</p>
<p>Adds Electrical and Mechanical Engineering Departments, Stalling if Government Subsidy is Insufficient (Beiping, 22nd) Tsinghua President Mei Yi-qi said that since the suspension of Geng funds payment in March last year, the school's funding has been very tight. Although the government has provided some subsidies, it is far from enough. Now, the school is adding electrical and mechanical engineering departments, and the equipment costs are extremely high. If the Geng funds payment is suspended again and the national subsidy is insufficient, the school's foundation will be shaken. We hope that this will not become a reality, so that more than 900 young students at the school will not be suspended.</p>
<p>Jiangsu Education Department Reviews Music Scores</p>
<p>And Plans to Compile and Distribute Music to Schools</p>
<p>Zhou Fohai, Director of the Jiangsu Education Department, has always attached great importance to music. However, the music teaching materials used in various schools and social education institutions in Jiangsu Province are extremely uneven. There are many excellent works, but also many mediocre, shallow, and vulgar songs. Director Zhou believes that the main function of music scores is to promote the national spirit, excite national sentiments, and cultivate the upward spirit of the people. It has a significant impact on young people. Therefore, he has ordered the compilation and review office to draft a detailed plan, first to review the music teaching materials in various schools and other places, and give awards, suppressions, deletions, and retentions. The second step is to hire music experts and well-known writers to compile and distribute song scores suitable for various schools and other places, so that the soft and weak style can be changed to an impassioned and stirring atmosphere. Recently, various schools and other places have submitted music teaching materials to the department one after another, and they are actively engaged in review work, strictly screening them.</p>

<p>Organizes Educational Experimentation and Research Association</p>
<p>Defines the Work of Experimental Research</p>
<p>The Third Section of the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Education is in charge of the Bureau's testing, experimentation, statistics, and compilation matters. In terms of the experimental stock, a special experimental primary school is set up, like an experimental work ground in education. An Elementary School Education Experimentation Research Association is also formed to promote the interest and efficiency of elementary school education experimentation research. This kind of organization is actually a good system for the academicization of educational administration. Since Director Pan took office, he has paid special attention to educational research. It is reported that the research work recently carried out by the experimental stock of the Section is as follows: 1. Define the outline of the work of each group of the Elementary School Education Experimentation Research Association; 2. Define the outline of the health education experimentation research of each group of the Experimentation Research Association this semester; 3. Collect, organize and study the scoring methods of each primary school; 4. Revise the scoring methods for primary and secondary schools, the promotion and retention grades, and the graduation standards. 5. Organize the Kindergarten Primary School Curriculum Compilation Committee. 6. Formulate curriculum compilation methods; 7. Collection and compilation of central teaching materials; 8. Hold the Elementary School Education Experimentation Research Association; 9. Search and compile reference materials on elementary school education experimentation problems; 10. Solicit difficult problems from municipal primary schools for research; 11. Plan to organize a reading club for elementary school teachers. In addition, the testing stock of the Section is currently engaged in compiling the intelligence test scale for kindergartens and lower grades of primary schools, using the material from Bode's village in the United States. This work is expected to be completed within half a year. After the intelligence test standard is obtained in the future, it will not only be convenient for the application of each primary school in this city, but it will also make a considerable contribution in academics.</p>

<h3>City Education Bureau Adds Newspaper Reading Stands for the Public in the City</h3>
<p>A Total of 167 Locations Throughout the City</p>
<p>For the sake of promoting social education, the City Education Bureau has specially erected public newspaper reading stands in various thoroughfares of the city, so that the people may all have the opportunity to read newspapers, and thus gain a clear understanding of the actual situation of politics and society. In total, 156 stands were set up throughout the city. Since the outbreak of the January 28th Incident, 33 newspaper reading stands in the war zones of Zhabei, Jiangwan, Yinxiang, and Wusong were destroyed by artillery fire, and 5 were damaged. In other areas, such as South Shanghai, Pu Song, Caojing, Tangqiao, and Yangsi, 17 stands were damaged due to wind and rain erosion and years of disrepair. This year, the damaged newspaper reading stands in various areas of South Shanghai have been successively surveyed, repaired, and reinstalled. Furthermore, considering that the population of the South Shanghai area has increased since the war, there is a need to add more newspaper reading stands. Four stands have already been added. The business environment in the war zone has gradually recovered, and most people have moved back. There is also an urgent need to repair the newspaper reading stands. Staff have been dispatched to survey the environment and geographical conditions, and designs and plans have been drawn up. A total of 34 stands will be repaired and installed in the Zhabei district, 5 stands will be repaired in the Jiangwan district, 3 stands will be repaired in the Yinxiang district, and 3 stands will be repaired in the Wusong district, for a total of 45 stands. It is now estimated that there are a total of 167 newspaper reading stands in the city.</p>
<p>Opening Ceremony of the National Shanghai College of Commerce</p>
<p>The National Shanghai College of Commerce on Avenue Joffre was almost completely destroyed by the violent Japanese. However, thanks to the efforts of the college's faculty and staff, academic progress has been rapid. Graduates have achieved excellent results and have been praised by people in society. The internal facilities have been renovated by President Xu, and the atmosphere is becoming more vibrant. A make-up opening ceremony was held recently, and teachers and students gathered together in a dignified and solemn atmosphere, which was quite pleasant. First, President Xu reported on several points as follows: (1) Regarding the college's facilities: The college was almost completely destroyed by the violent Japanese. Thanks to the efforts of the college's faculty and staff, recovery has been swift. In terms of books, in addition to donations, cash purchases have reached 20,000 yuan within half a year. Calculating machines and typewriters required for the statistics and accounting programs have all been purchased, which is sufficient for current use. Sports and military education supplies have also been actively replenished after planning by Director Jiang Xiangqing and Instructor Song. Therefore, all of the college's facilities have been restored to a considerable extent. Regarding the college buildings, President Xu Peikun has already submitted a plan for restoration to the college affairs meeting and discussed the allocation of additional funds with Minister of Education Zhu Jiahua, who agreed to find a way. Therefore, there is great hope for expansion in terms of funding and facilities. The specialized programs that have been established for many years are also being vigorously reorganized and expanded. (2) Except for one or two faculty members who voluntarily resigned or requested leave, all faculty members remain the same, and several new faculty members have been hired. The list is as follows: Wu Yugan, Zhang Sumin, Shen Liren, Jiang Xiangqing, Song Chongjiu, Liu Siye, Wang Zhixin, Kong De, Xiong Baosun, Huang Zongyu, Li Juegui, Zhang Ruizhen, Shen Hongchen, Sun Lan, Yang Bingxun, Ji Xinde, Wang Xiaowen, Zhu Zhongming, Yu Songhua, Xue Weizengpei, Wu Huirong, Zhou Yangwen, Zhao Junhao, Shen Xirui, Shi Bohang, Sun Enlin, Shen Zouting, Xiong Dahui, Wang Danhua, Du Tingxuan, and Shen Dashi. This semester, national treasures such as Ge Zulan, Cai Zhengya, Cui Yuzhen, Zhu Sihuang, Fu Huancan, Bai Yu, and Cao Jingyuan and other experts have been hired as professors. (3) The status and educational policy of the College of Commerce: The college's education has always emphasized rigor and has also focused on the simultaneous development of moral, intellectual, and physical education. In the past two years, due to the influence of the environment and trends, the college's education has been negatively affected. However, as the college is an educational institution, I (Xu, referring to himself) will work with my colleagues to promote the academicization of the school and the implementation of scientific education. Politicization and modernization are definitely not the goals of the college's teaching, and we should all eliminate them. Subsequently, Director Wu, Director Shen, Director Zhang, and others all gave speeches. The meeting ended at one o'clock.</p>
<p>Record of the Opening Ceremony of the Shanghai College of Commerce</p>
<p>The Shanghai College of Commerce in the downtown area of Shanghai University held its opening ceremony last week. Recently, a supplementary opening ceremony was held in the hall diagonally opposite the college site. More than 400 faculty, staff, and students attended. First, rituals were performed, and three minutes of silence were observed for those who died in the national crisis and war. Then, President Liu gave a speech, roughly stating that during the national crisis, he hoped that the students would (1) work hard, (2) practice work-study, and (3) focus on diligence and honesty to cope with all difficult environments. Later, he elaborated on the college's development, such as increasing the number of scholarships, implementing vocational guidance, and conducting an industrial and commercial research department. Finally, Secretary-General Shen Wei reported on academic affairs, and Professor Bi Yisi spoke on the true meaning of education, and Bing Zhi spoke on biology.</p>
<p>Upon the Invitation of Shanghai Girls' High School</p>
<p>The Shanghai Girls' High School in the Nanshi area of Shanghai invited Dr. Bing Zhi, Director of the Institute of Biology of the Science Society of China, to give a lecture on biology during the memorial week last Thursday morning. He briefly stated that elementary schools in European and American countries initially focused on Latin and Greek, because Latin and other languages are the foundation of Western literature. However, teaching was difficult, and because it was boring and tasteless, the results were minimal. Therefore, Latin and other languages have now been abolished and replaced with biology. Elementary school students love beauty by nature and can all enthusiastically study. As a result, they benefit greatly. Because biology covers a wide range of topics, engaging in research, whether in intellectual, physical, or moral education, is of great benefit. Moreover, biology is greatly related to agriculture, medicine, industry, chemistry, physics, statistics, sociology, philosophy, and so on. Biology is a phenomenon of life, and there is everything in it. Therefore, learning biology is a shortcut to studying other sciences. Other sciences have things that can be sought and things that cannot be sought, but biology is something that everyone, regardless of age, wealth, or poverty, can obtain. In addition, Mr. Zhang Dongmin, the principal of Tonghui Middle School, spoke about ants and students.</p>
<p>Recent News from the Girls' Department of Huadong Middle School</p>
<p>The Girls' Department of Huadong Middle School, located at the western end of Xieqiao, Beile Road in this city, has strict teaching management on weekdays, which is highly praised by people in society. Since it was approved and registered by the Shanghai Education Bureau last year, its reputation has grown even more. This semester, new students have come to study in unusually crowded numbers. Currently, the number of students in primary and secondary schools has reached more than 300. Starting this semester, due to the large number of new students, the training and education matters should be more stringent. Each grade is assigned a full-time teacher as a grade-level mentor to take special responsibility for training and education, so as to achieve the effect of integrating education and training. It is heard that the requests from new students to enroll are still coming in an endless stream. The school has specially increased the number of students in the first-year spring semester and the first and second-year autumn semesters of junior high school, as well as the first and second-year of the regular and normal courses of senior high school, in order to meet the demand.</p>
<p>Opening of the White Goose Painting Tutoring School</p>
<p>The White Goose Painting Tutoring School, registered with the Ministry of Education and registered with the Shanghai Education Bureau, officially opened on the 15th. The face-to-face department is personally taught by famous artists Chen Qiucao, Fang Xuegu, etc. Mr. Pan Sitong, the director of the correspondence department, is also making every effort to restore all matters related to correspondence painting. Preparations are now complete, and long-term enrollment advertisements will be published in newspapers in early February. Many scholars from various places have sent letters to join. Everyone believes that there is no such institution in China that has been operating for many years and has sufficient experience in handling a complete painting correspondence department. It is heard that the school, in view of the needs of society, has specially opened an intensive applied art class every morning, which has already started on the 15th. In a period of six months, it can complete various practical painting applications. The subjects are divided into four types: sketching (cartoons, caricatures, advertising paintings, decorative paintings, etc.), coloring (book cover paintings, advertisements, and various decorative paintings), patterns (color, war color, craftsmanship, and decorative patterns, etc.), and art writing (various Chinese and Western art writing methods). Fang Xuegu is personally responsible for teaching. Detailed and beautiful chapters are available. A four-cent stamp must be attached for requesting by mail. The school address is No. 724, a foreign-style house at the intersection of Avenue Edward VII and Avenue Carde.</p>

<p>Appropriate Material Can Assist Sports Administration Facilities and Teaching Training</p>
<p>For the sake of promoting sports, the Shanghai Qinfen Bookstore has invited national sports experts to co-author the "Sports Series," of which more than 30 titles have been published. They are essential books for educational institutions, sports teachers, students, and athletes across the country. Minister of Education Zhu Jiahua has praised the series highly. Now, Chen Bulei, Director of the Zhejiang Education Department, comments, "The series has appropriate material and can assist sports administration facilities and teaching training."</p>
<p>Preparation for the Capital's Shuttlecock Kicking Competition</p>
<p>The Standing Committee of the Ministry of Education's Sports Committee has decided to hold a shuttlecock kicking competition on March 26th in cooperation with the Beijing Municipal Social Bureau. According to a certain sports expert from the Beijing Municipal Social Bureau, since this competition is jointly organized by the Ministry and the Bureau, it is best for the two parties to jointly form a preparatory committee in order to prepare in advance. It is heard that although the Ministry of Education's Sports Committee has formulated competition regulations, they are too specific and not comprehensive enough. Because this competition is open to all sectors, regardless of gender, age, or age, the number of people is bound to be large. If the number of people is large, it is necessary to divide them into groups. Otherwise, if each person kicks for a few minutes in one place, the time will definitely be insufficient. The weight and length of the shuttlecocks should be pre-determined to ensure uniformity. The venue must also be carefully selected. Because shuttlecock kicking is affected by strong winds, an open area is inconvenient. In rainy weather, it must be held indoors. All of this must be planned in advance. It is also heard that the Beijing Municipal Social Bureau had planned to hold a shuttlecock kicking competition last year, and various regulations had been carefully formulated. However, it was interrupted midway due to the January 28th Incident. The Bureau has now sent the detailed regulations that it formulated for reference to the Sports Committee of the Ministry of Education. For the sake of actively preparing in advance, the Ministry and the Bureau will contact each other to engage in preparation work.</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Violet Musings</h3>
<p>— Shou Juan</p>
<p>On the night of February 19th, I returned to Shanghai from Suzhou. In the light, drizzling rain, I hurried to my residence on Avenue Lafayette, feeling extremely tired. As I got out of the car, I accidentally dropped my small black leather wallet, which had been with me for ten years. The next morning, when I woke up from a dream, I realized what had happened. I was immediately alarmed and at a loss, because in addition to my own commonly used crystal seal, there were also one or two important items that others had entrusted to me. If they were lost, how could I face them? And there was also a manuscript from my Suzhou friend Zhu Qingyun, which he had personally given to me with great solemnity, asking me to publish it in this column. This was the crystallization of his hard work, and I would feel very sorry if it were lost. There was nothing I could do at the moment, so I ran to see my old classmate Zheng Yaonan, drafted an advertisement, and asked him to publish it on my behalf, declaring the loss on one hand and hoping for the one in ten thousand chance that it would be returned on the other. Who knew that on the day the advertisement was published, I received a pleasant surprise from out of the blue early in the morning, signed with the three characters "Fang Gengshan." It said that he had picked up the wallet and, because he cherished morality all his life, he was eager to return it to its owner, and asked me to meet him immediately at the Dafang Trading Company in the Garment Exchange Building. I was overjoyed and hurried to see him. I went in and saw a kind-looking elder in his forties, wearing a neat Western suit, who came up to shake my hand. It turned out that he was the "morally minded" Mr. Fang Gengshan. After a brief exchange of pleasantries, I learned that he was from Ningbo and had been doing business in Burma. After returning to China, he founded the Dafang Trading Company, dealing in camel hair. All his life, he had been a vegetarian and a Buddhist, and he was committed to moral conduct. In view of the degenerate state of the world, he was very willing to promote social morality. That night, he was returning from a social engagement at a relative's house. As he passed Avenue Lafayette on his way back to his residence on Route Sayzo, he inadvertently picked up the small wallet. After returning to his residence, he opened it and found my business card, so he wrote to me. He then took the wallet out of the safe and handed it back to me item by item, without any errors, and refused any reward, only wishing to be a permanent friend with me. At that time, I was extremely moved and had to thank him sincerely. Mr. Fang even saw me to the door before shaking hands. It is truly commendable to be a moralist, so I hurriedly recorded it to encourage the world.</p>
<h3>Stubborn Wife and Bad Son</h3>
<p>— Baihe</p>
<p>丨How to Deal with It丨</p>
<p>An unpromising son spends all day and night mixing outside, fighting, and stealing. It seems a bit unworthy to have the victim teach him a lesson with a solid fist. Moreover, it seems that there is no explanation for the faces of his parents. But if it goes on like this, it won't work in the end. So I had to go to his parents. The parents had no way to think, so they only posted a notice to expel the bad son, severing the father-son relationship, letting him starve to death, be beaten to death, or be sent to the Public Security Bureau for legal action.</p>
<p>A shrewish woman does dishonorable things outside. When her husband finds out, of course he will rebuke her or restrict her freedom. But the more shrewish a woman is, the more she will act. Often the husband puts on a smiling face to persuade her, but she slaps the table and benches, crying and shouting injustice. If the husband's heart hardens and ignores her, she will lie straight in bed and go on a hunger strike. If this trick still can't scare the husband, then, without being polite, he will untie his trousers and hang them on the bed frame, crying and pretending to be hanging himself. At this point, the husband, fearing that it will come true, will give in and admit that he is wrong.</p>
<p>In the League of Nations' handling of the Northeast case, China has been pacing slowly, following the path of civilization, step by step. Although she has suffered losses, she has never turned blue in the face and argued with the opponent, but regarded the opponent as someone else's stubborn son and shrewish wife, and negotiated with the League of Nations, which is in the position of father, elder brother, or husband. The opponent is indeed shrewish, refusing left and right, tears and snot, just acting coquettishly. Now they are preparing to withdraw from the League of Nations. It is said that this is their third trick.</p>
<p>At this point, all the affected affectations have come to an end, and the last minute has arrived. But I don't know if the League of Nations is prepared to give in with pity and affection, or to expel the bad son with great fanfare? The day is gradually approaching, and everyone is watching.</p>
<h3>A Head-on Blow to Heartless Men and Women</h3>
<p>— Ren</p>
<p>People have a key, and this key can greatly change a person's heart. That is, when a person is successful, they can forget the previous kindness, righteousness, love, and even the future life will not be considered.</p>
<p>Especially in the field of love, it can be confirmed that the above is indeed the case. He and she were initially inseparable. Once his or her status increases, it is easy to forget the other party, abandon the old and love the new, creating the tragic scene of "seeing the new people laugh, but not hearing the old people cry."</p>
<p>Many young people often lose their original ambition in order to lose their partner, or even commit suicide to escape this troublesome world. It is sad to say!</p>
<p>I heard that the latest sound feature film "Disappointment in Love" from Mingxing Film Company takes this idea as its theme. It is starred by former movie queen Zhang Zhiyun, which makes the performance particularly tragic. I think this film is indeed a head-on blow to the heartless men and women of the world.</p>

<p>Financial Silver Price Increase Proposal Difficult to Pass Temporarily</p>
<p>Benchmark Prices Accelerate, Rising to 11.3 Taels. According to foreign dispatches yesterday, London's spot and forward contracts both rose by 25, but the exchange rate plummeted by 1.9375 and 2.875. New York's silver price remained unchanged, while forward silver prices edged up by 0.065. American cotton also declined. Bank private cables showed a decrease of 0.0625, opening directly at 772 taels, reaching 1.2 taels. Foreign reports indicated that all proposals to raise silver prices in the United States were unlikely to be deeply discussed immediately due to President Hoover's imminent departure. Morale was high. Major players like Hengxing immediately entered the market, and the exchange market also improved steadily. HSBC quoted a shilling down by 0.125, and the US dollar down by 0.375. Although there were minor fluctuations, the price was briefly driven up to 777 taels, because the May US dollar exchange rate reached 9 yuan, already tightening by 0.125 compared to the initial rate. Afterwards, the gold market banks became calm and gradually retreated to around 4 taels, as the domestic market also hardened slightly by 0.0625. Finally, due to reduced trading, market conditions were extremely quiet, closing at 774.7 taels. The morning was strong, followed by a quiet afternoon, with eager buyers. "Cooked Red" (smuggled silver) plummeted due to obstructed outbound routes, calculated to add 15 taels. Swap rates also decreased accordingly, with two to three-month rates offered to longs at only 2.5 taels, and three to four-month rates at only 5 taels. Spot firms all came to swap out. Overall, gold prices rebounded sharply, while swap rates and "cooked red" both saw a drastic drop, truly unpredictable. The market conditions for half a day are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Half-Day Process: The morning opened at 772 taels, jumping up 8.6 taels from the previous close. Spot goods opened at 1.6 taels. At this time, the market conditions were extremely chaotic, once falling to 1.2 taels. The exchange market opened well too. Hengxing, Yuanmaoyong, and others first rushed in, rising to 3.5 taels. The foreign report that all proposals to raise silver prices in the United States were temporarily unable to pass saw a slight decline. Later, buyers surged in, with Hengxing continuously making aggressive purchases, Fuyu, Bingxing, and Fuchang all , and reaching 4.8 taels. Spot goods all came to hedge out, gradually retreating to 3 taels. The exchange market was also good. Citibank bought the May US dollar at 9.1875 yuan, Hengyu came in, gradually rising to 5 taels. Ananda and HSBC continued to buy the same month at 0.0625, Yuanmaoyong entered further, and it was driven up to 6.1 taels. Shen Da sold slightly, at around 5 taels. Yuanmaoyong continued to enter to above 6 taels. The April US dollar at 8.875 yuan was sold by Huabi to Sassoon, but they were still willing to cover. Hongli came to sell, then fell to 4 taels. Yuan Cangyong bought again, although seeing 4 8, but because Citibank also sold the April US dollar at 875, it remained at 4 taels. HSBC's listing was also announced at this time, calculating a shilling down by 0.125, and the US dollar reduced by 0.175, which was not satisfactory. Due to banks taking in the June US dollar at 25, it rose to 5 taels. Dadecheng sold off, briefly declining. Huabi suddenly bought the March US dollar at 875, brokers also wanted it. Yuanxiang first entered, Yifeng, Yongfuchang, and Fuyu all entered to above 6 taels, Huabi bought the June US dollar at 1875. When Huabi again took in the May dollar at just 9 yuan, it stopped at 7 taels. Banks' appetite also calmed, and spot goods Ruikang came to sell, gradually retreating to 5.3 taels. At this time, very few transactions occurred, and the market conditions were very calm. Maijia Li ate the June US dollar at 1875, Wanxing came to enter, at 6 taels. Shunli, Yingfeng, and Heng came to sell later. Hongli and Hongxing came to enter, thus contending at around 6 taels. Huabi sold the April US dollar at 9375, coupled with frequent retail sales, Hengyu also sold, reaching 4.1 taels. Zhifeng and Yongtongyi came to buy, at 4.9 taels. At this time, it was close to the noon close, and very few transactions occurred, so only saw a few cents rise and fall. The final closing was 774.7 taels. After the close, buyers were active, and the atmosphere was also good, and it continued to rise to above 5.5 taels, so spot goods were bid up to 5.5 taels at the close. Looking back, the market conditions for half a day were extremely good, the highest price was 777 taels, and the lowest price was 771.2 taels, with a difference of 5.8 taels. The result was an increase of 11.3 taels compared to the previous time.</p>
<p>Listed Price and Allocation The listed price was allocated because the US exchange rate was reduced by 0.375, calculated at 8.25 yuan, equivalent to a gold benchmark price of 849.56 taels. According to the closing price, approximately 74 taels were pledged, with little difference compared to the previous close. This month's registered amount was 784 taels, March's registered amount was 780 taels, April's registered amount was 775 taels, and the water supplement was 779 taels.</p>

Guangbang Hengxing entered more than 200, Shengda slightly sold.</p>
<p>Central Bank Opens Cash Trading Light Although the Central Bank continued to open cash trading, it seemed less tense than in the past, so the market was quite indifferent to it. Spot firms seemed to tend to stillness, only heard that Hengxing had opened and entered 385 articles on its behalf, all priced at 5 taels.</p>
<p>"Cooked Red" Prices Fall "Cooked Red" prices fell today because a certain firm's private export was intercepted by customs the previous day, and the outbound route was cut off, calculated to add 15 taels. Initially, Yingfengheng sold to Dafengheng about 300, followed by Dade Kua coming to seek goods, sold 35 articles by Hankou bang Shencheng, also at 15 taels. Although the price fell, the situation was relatively flat.</p>
<p>Swap Premium Lower Swap rates tended to be lower due to "cooked red" relations. Yingfengheng aggressively swapped out three to four months.</p>
<p>The premium was lowered, with the shorts offering a premium of 5 taels. Dadecheng offered a premium of 364 articles to Yingfengheng, Huixiang also offered a premium of 49 articles to Yingfengheng, Yongfeng offered 2.5 taels to Qianchangxiang for February and March, calculated at 18 articles, Yuanmaoyong offered 5 taels to Yingfengheng for March and April, calculated at 56 articles, Dingchang offered 14 taels to Runchangyong for February and April, calculated at 18 articles, Runchangyong again offered 13 taels to Tongfengheng for February and April, calculated at 18 articles (but this item) or may not have been done today).

A Good Phenomenon Amidst Securities Foreign Aggression</p>
<p>Debenture Empty Covering Rises This Month</p>
<p>Except for 96, all uniformly good 0.4 to 1 yuan plus</p>
<p>Yesterday, at the Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange, the debenture market, because this month's trading was only this day, and the amount of account storage was still huge, the market was dominated by the diplomatic situation, as the standard for advances and retreats by both long and short sides. Yesterday, because there were no significant changes in the diplomatic situation, the market, because the recent market price of the disarmament bonds was particularly small, so the empty covers, such as No. 47 and retail investors, had quite a bit of buying, and suddenly raised 1 yuan and 4 jiao, and the morale was also improved. After this, various types, due to the needs of each gang, also improved by several jiao. Most were afraid of squeezing the empty, so retail investors and No. 47 still had supplements in the secondary market, but the rise became weaker and weaker, from 6 to 7 jiao down to 1 to 2 jiao, and the salt tax even fell by 1 jiao, the trend was entirely due to the different entry and exit of the long and short sides. When the afternoon market opened, there were rumors of the fall of the North Ticket, and the market price returned slightly, the disarmament bonds fluctuated the most, falling by 7 jiao alone, and the rest also fell by 1 to 2 jiao to 3 to 4 jiao, while the salt tax, due to more shorts, rose back by 5 fen to 1 jiao. At the close, the current month still had empty covers, and continued to rise by 3 to 4 jiao, and the disarmament bonds also rose by 5 jiao alone. The trend, because this month is too short, shorts who have no goods to deliver have to cover, so there is this phenomenon, which has nothing to do with the entire rise and fall of the bond market. As a result of the market price, compared with the previous day, except for 96, all uniformly rose by 4 to 5 jiao to more than 1 yuan, among which the 19th customs this month rose the most by 1 yuan and 6 jiao, followed by the disarmament bonds this month also rising by 1 yuan and a half, but the comparable price of the whole 6 spot goods, because it has been separated for a long time, fell by as much as 3 yuan and 6 jiao, the total number of transactions totaled 929.2 thousand yuan, of which only the whole 6 spot goods traded 2 thousand yuan, futures still accounted for the majority of the unified salt tax, a total of 4.11 million, disarmament bonds 1.4 million, and the rest were less than 1 million, the 18th customs only 140,000, the whole 690,000, and 96 only 5,000. Transactions are still dominated by the March period.</p>
<p>New York Stock Market Still Hovering</p>
<p>Xinfeng Foreign Firm reported that on Tuesday (21st) the New York stock market was still hovering. It was quite stable in the early morning, but because the financial turmoil in Michigan was still not optimistic, and other various bad news, the market trended towards weakness. American Telephone and Telegraph fell by 1 yuan, because the New England Telephone Company reduced dividends, and the district of A'er Basin was brewing an investigation into telephone price lists. The American joint-stock wireless electricity was weak, because the court ruled that General Electric Company and Westinghouse Electric Company would distribute all the shares of wireless radio companies to shareholders as dividends, and these people sold them on the market. Although Qiu Sai Wo Hao Chi Road announced that dividends would be paid as usual, railway stocks also trended downstream in the end. The day's trading was very light, with a total of 690,000 shares traded. Also, the New York Stock Exchange was closed for one day on the 22nd for Washington's Birthday.

<p>Yarn and Flower Standard Yarn Flowers Suddenly React</p>
<p>Yarn's rebound is stronger than flowers</p>
<p>After several days of continuous decline in the yarn market, a sudden gust of wind rose, because a part of the Sichuan gang purchased spot yarn, totaling 1,5600 packs, which made the people's hearts firmer, and retail investors offset. At the same time, there were still rumors in the business community, saying that yarn factories have a theory of reducing work, so the market atmosphere is even higher, but the overseas cotton industry situation is still in decline, the future is still based on actual sales for expansion and contraction.</p>
<p>This month's yarn recovered well one or two six people bid on the previous market, with foreign cotton trending down, but gold prices soared</p>

<p>Yesterday, the source in Hu Nan was still the boatmen's dispute, which has not yet been resolved. Only the No. 45 wheel tug boat has arrived, and the town and country guests are few, and the package stomach is sluggish, but because the source is completely absent, the market is better. The price of the Su Tong gang is one dime higher, and the price of the Chang gang Zhongguan goods is also a dime higher. The price of Qingjiao Bo Rice is fixed due to the sluggish package stomach. The price of Nan Gang and other rice has also improved. Du Yang's sharp has no honor or disgrace, the exchange of yuan is stagnant, and the price is a dime higher. The exchange of yuan is still available, but the number is small, and the market is not noisy.</p>
<p>Hebei gangs have no lines to boats, the white japonica shop stomach is weak, there is no exchange in the four townships, and the high goods are fixed. The medium-second trend is weak, and the thin japonica early rice arrives with less flat sales, and the price trend is weak. Sheep Du Bu sharp source is slightly available, the de-stocking is sluggish, and the price is down by several fen. The guest sharp is also soft, and the exchange of yuan is still lacking, although there are no few arrivals of white yuan, but the stomach dissolution is minimal, resulting in a further decline in prices.</p>
<p>Jiangbei Xianxin Arrived in Batches</p>
<p>Red rice continues to rise</p>
<p>Yesterday's Ke Xian market conditions, both arrival and sales were active. In addition to Xiang's various Xian, there was also a new batch of Jiangbei Ke Xian, and the goods were still acceptable, so the whole street completely took them away, and the price was 7 yuan, 6 jiao and a half. Fuzhou gang's appetite is still strong, and the street also continues to inquire, but the machine is late, etc. There are too many arrivals, the market is flat and soft, and only the machine red and red rough files, because the stock in the market is insufficient, the number of arrivals is limited, and the appetite of this customer is good, and they are mutually competing in the market, and the price has suddenly risen by more than one jiao, and the total market is exchanged from the Min gang to Hunan red rough 1,770 packs, the price is 7 yuan and 2 jiao, and then 6 yuan and 9 jiao and a half, this street exchanges 500 packs of Xiangji red rice, the price is 7 yuan, 3 jiao, 2 fen to 7 yuan and 1 jiao, Jiangxi machine is expected to open 2,500 packs, of which 200 packs are exchanged by the Min gang, and all of them are taken in by the street, the price is 8 yuan Wang Jiao 8 fen to 8 yuan 3 jiao.</p>
<p>Later Market Biao Powder Gradually Improves</p>
<p>Yesterday's flour market, the morning was initially stable and continued, the price of Yangmai reported an improvement of about 1 or 2 jiao, so at the initial opening, people's hearts were quite shaken, better than the previous day by 5 li to 79 li and a half, etc. In the following rounds, because of the slight transactions of the Ke gang in the current month, the market remained stable, and the distant period buying was more lonely, which seemed to be slightly flat and soft, but when the afternoon market opened, the months gradually showed a firm appearance, because Shandong and Hunan gangs had a very strong appetite, especially the purchases in February and March were even stronger, so although the transactions in each round were not smooth, the market price was gradually better, but Huafeng continued to de-stock 3 to 40,000 packs for the current month due to the surplus, otherwise the increase in the current month would not be the case, and from now on, if the sea trade is as usual, the source is strong, it seems that there is little hope for improvement, and as a result, the current month has increased by 1 fen 2 li half compared with the previous day, March has increased by 2 fen half, April has increased by 1 fen, May has increased by 1 fen 2 li half, June has increased by 1 fen, and July has increased by 7 li half.</p>
<p>Period Wheat Near Fall Far Flat</p>
<p>Yesterday, the afternoon market opened after the period wheat morning, and each month presented a near-fall and far-flat image. The opening price in the current month has turned flat, and the afternoon to the closing, it is even more unstable, because the longs are all laymen, and have no ability to receive goods, and the delivery is near, so they have to get rid of the settlement, so the closing price has fallen to 3 yuan, 2 qian and 6 fen, which is 3 fen lower than the previous day. The far months, roughly hovering, do not enter or leave much, and as a result, March is better by 1 fen compared to the previous day, April is not moving, May and June are not open, July is slightly lower by 1 fen, 21st Chicago electricity, wheat first fell due to the Liverpool market report being small, and then rebounded due to the poor situation of winter production, and the previous day's transaction was 10 million bushel, and the Dow Jones Index is as left.</p>
<p>Closing Price Compared to Previous Day</p>
<p>May period 48.000 rises 0.625</p>
<p>July period 48.625 rises 0.375</p>
<p>September period 49.875 rises 0.500</p>
<p>Yellow Beans Sales Move Market Firm</p>
<p>Yellow bean factory stomach is lively, the market sees an increase, and yesterday the market traded seven cars of train beans, and the future is expected to continue to rise, but the cake sales are slightly loose due to the factory's delayed delivery, which is afraid of making the bean fall light, and the market conditions will inevitably become soft. Red grain has recently arrived with new goods one after another, and the route is moved by zero households in the interior, so the market is flat and tired. The oil market is weak due to the continuous source and the flat sales, so the market is weak.</p>
<p>Sugar Market Chao Qing Sugar Shop Disc Falls Slightly</p>
<p>Although the sugar market had a rebound in the gold standard yesterday, the transactions were still rare, and as the spot goods entered by the 24 coarse sand white industries could be shipped out of the warehouse, the transactions in the Association's disc were even more sparse, which further increased its fatigue, and the Unified City only had a transaction of 200 packages, the price was 15 yuan, 4 qian, 5 fen, 20 medium sand white 15 yuan, 2 qian and a half, and 890 Dutch red called 12 yuan, 123 qian, all less affected, and the Chao gang number family continued to open a batch of Chao Qing, calculating the spectrum of 600 packs, the price was 9 yuan and a half to 9 yuan, a drop of money, and opened more than 50 packs of full ice, the color and taste were excellent, and it could have risen slightly, but the Yang sugar dropped step by step, and it still opened at 16 yuan. Because the inventory of Jianbing was short, although there were continuous arrivals the previous day, the number was not large, so the crowd was tired and alone, and the retail openings rose by 1 or 2 qian, and the trend was stable.</p>
<p>North-South Goods Fungus Rise is Quite Strong</p>
<p>Fungus has recently risen again in the local market. According to the letter from Hankou, the current market price of high goods is 54 taels, and the second is 523 taels. Adding all external expenses, it costs 645 taels to open a shop here, and the rise in the price of passenger goods here is even higher. The high Sichuan fungus is opened to 67 taels, which is another 3 taels higher than before. At the same time, although the price has risen in the industry, it has not been able to pass too high. Benpai fungus has been sold at 62 taels, and ordinary goods have been sold at 60 taels, which has also increased by 2 or 3 taels. If sales turn out to be smooth in the later market, they will inevitably continue to rise.</p>
<p>Silk Tea European and American Silk Sales Unlikely to Turn Around</p>
<p>Yesterday, the silk market in foreign houses in this port still lacked the hope of turning around. The reason is that the sales of Japanese goods in Yokohama and other places are strong and the prices are declining. European and American silk weavers have a thick stock of silk in their hands, and the period silks have no appetite for entering, so the silk electricity is not transferred.</p>
<p>More Than 200 Boxes of Rayon are Transported to Yantai and Qingdao</p>
<p>In the past two days, the export of rayon in this port has suddenly been strong. Yesterday, An Sheng and other wheels shipped from Shanghai, and the Lu silk merchants had a total of 260 boxes of rayon to Yantai, Qingdao, Weihaiwei and other ports. The current and futures sales of the market association this month are still not lonely, and the Yangtze River gang, etc. have also entered 32 boxes of medium-sized goods, and the price is still firm.</p>
<p>More Than 100 Pieces of White Silk Heads are</p>

<h3>The Landlord</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>At this time last year, when the Japanese invaders' field artillery and tanks were orchestrating the "Symphony of Blood Flowers" in Zhabei, the head of the shelter that housed our family of three, my old aunt's husband, would always tell us many stories at a fixed time each day, like a storyteller; among them was this tragic and fervent folk anecdote. The origin of this anecdote is Chongming! A lone island with the most precarious situation outside the mouth of the Yangtze River, and a national defense fortress voluntarily abandoned by our Chinese government. The time was probably during the Daoguang or Tongzhi years of the former Qing Dynasty. As for exactly which year, month, and day, I can't report it; fortunately, it doesn't have any major relationship with the story itself, so let it remain vague!</p>
<p>The setting sun cast a blood-red light, turning the green leaves of a distant willow forest purple; a clear pool of water outside the forest reflected the light, appearing like a blood-filled channel.</p>
<p>Beyond the forest was a river, and within the forest was hidden a huge manor.</p>
<p>At this time, on a wide open space between the forest and the manor, six fierce dogs with deep yellow fur and sharp claws were chasing and fighting each other, constantly emitting a roar common to beasts, drowning out the voices of the people in the courtyard; in one corner of the space, next to a large stone dumbbell used for martial arts practice, lay a mangy, piebald dog, its long, pale red tongue lolling out as it panted heavily, its eyes wide open, watching its companions' martial arts practice with great interest, but it was unable to participate itself.</p>
<p>"Brother Zhao, go back and rest well!" Two people walked out of the house. In front was a young farmer, but his waist was already bent like a bow, and he had to rest after every two steps, looking as frail as an old man of sixty; behind him, seeing him off, was an old man whose body stood as tall as a mountain, his foot-long white beard looking like an ornament. Although he was also wearing coarse cloth trousers and a shirt, without any gorgeous robes draped over him, people naturally felt a sense of respect and awe towards him, especially his pair of bright, piercing eyes, which were enough to make someone suffering from a guilty conscience flee upon seeing him.</p>
<p>"Landlord! I really don't know how to repay your kindness!" Zhao Erge, suffering from tuberculosis, said slowly in a trembling voice, "You still haven't come to collect what I owe you after all these years, and I feel too embarrassed myself! ... Now, I only hope ... that my illness can gradually lessen ... I will definitely ..."</p>
<p>The landlord used an arm like an iron bar to support Zhao Erge as they walked towards the open space.</p>
<h3>Excerpts from a Japanese Resident</h3>
<p>— Yi</p>
<p>| On the Chinese Invaders |</p>
<p>The Japanese militarists are blindly confident in force, engaging in reckless aggression, no different from Germany before the war! However, the Japanese people do not necessarily completely sympathize with the invasion of China; many oppose it. There is a Japanese resident in Shanghai who opposes the invasion of China, and I indirectly heard many words from one of his Chinese friends. He said: "The government (Japan) is adopting an exploitative policy towards China, willing to sacrifice everything and advance at risk; however, the thoughts of the Chinese residents are not 'exploitation' but 'peaceful residence and stable livelihoods'. Before September 18th, the residents were all peacefully residing and living in stability, but after September 18th, they became very uneasy; the January 28th Incident, in addition to the loss of life and property suffered by the residents during the war, also created many unemployed people, who have not been able to recover to this day, and are in unspeakable pain. Therefore, the residents do not hope for exploitation, and fundamentally do not hope for it, because even if exploitation succeeds, the people will not receive any benefits. The people in the interior have not encountered any personal harm, and are only confined to a narrow, vain nationalistic ideology, so they echo the government's exploitative policies." He also said: "The government initially wanted to find a way out of the extreme recession, and used force against the Three Eastern Provinces; the international dissatisfaction was expected long ago; but unexpectedly, the security of the Three Eastern Provinces could not be quickly restored, and they were even more angered by American intervention, so the military decided to go all the way, preparing to fight to the death with the United States. Recently, the whole country, from top to bottom, has been holding onto a single copper coin and gambling for ten yuan, the meaning of which is that the United States is a powerful naval nation, repeatedly frustrating Japan, acting as an obstacle to the invasion of China. If they fight to the death and win, the hegemony of the Pacific Ocean will be in Japanese hands, and all problems will be solved; even if they lose, and the opponent is the United States, then even defeat is glorious." These are the words of a Japanese, which can be used to glimpse the true psychology of Japanese merchants and the Japanese militarists' blind belief in force, inciting the people's war sentiments.</p>
<h3>Odds and Ends</h3>
<p>— Zhu Lu</p>
<p>Spring in Guangfu</p>
<p>Although the spring environment of Guangfu is still shrouded in a low, dark gray realm; the climate is still so cold, and the wind is still so surging, yet when the sunlight shines out with warm light through the cracks in the clouds, the grass has gradually turned tender and green, and the plum blossoms have also unfolded from tiny red beans into charming red flowers. Yes, spring has quietly returned to the earth. So, a group of elegant scholars and poets, especially the great men of the party and the state who are planning resistance plans, with plenty of leisure from their official duties, make mutual appointments for "plum blossom viewing tours." In the town of Guangfu, which is famous for its plum blossoms, one often sees the traces of great men and their retinues, and the travels of gentlemen and ladies.</p>
<p>Ancient Cypress Trees at the Situ Temple</p>
<p>Because of the title bestowed by the abdicated Qing Emperor, the "peculiar and ancient" cypress trees at the Situ Temple have become nationally renowned antiquities. However, there are actually seven ancient cypress trees at the Situ Temple, all with gnarled branches extending and green leaves soaring into the sky, but only four are famous as "peculiar and ancient." It really makes people puzzled. My friend Zuizhu told me that this is probably because the Qianlong Emperor visited the Situ Temple, saw these seven ancient cypress trees, and said to himself, "These cypress trees are indeed peculiar and ancient." So a group of sycophantic adults and gentlemen forcefully sealed four of them, to commemorate the Emperor's visit; the other three, because the Emperor's words only had four characters, which were not enough to allocate, became unknown heroes who were never recorded. Zuizhu's words may not be logically sound, but judging from the unequal treatment, there must be one or two points of reason!</p>
<p>Plum Blossoms on Dengwei Mountain</p>
<p>Plum blossoms are everywhere in the town of Guangfu. The vast flat forests, with flowers everywhere you look, connect villages and shelter all, forming a sea of fragrant snow. Passing the Zhiyan Ridge, the mountains and fields are full of plum forests. However, Dengwei Mountain, because of the hermit life of Han Dengwei, has been rendered into its own distinct category by a group of idol-worshipping believers. In fact, the most admirable plum blossoms in the town of Guangfu are in the village of "Tianjing." The plum blossoms there are all bonsai that are artificially tied and shaped; with double petals that are colorful and dazzling, and branches and trunks that are gnarled and curved, they are like girls from the era of eyebrow painting and hair perming, having undergone delicate artificial cosmetic surgery, they are indeed beautiful and eye-catching, although they are only decorations in the garden and cannot generate profits. Although a pavilion called Xiang Xue Hai (Sea of Fragrant Snow) has been built on the banks of Wanbu Pond, mulberries are more abundant than plum blossoms, and it has become a hermit who is purely stealing fame.</p>
<p>Loquat from Yaoshang</p>
<p>In addition to plums and waxberries, loquats are also very famous among the fruits produced in Guangfu. The white sand loquats produced in Yaoshang, with small seeds and thick flesh, fresh, sweet and delicious, are even more outstanding fruits. That kind of loquat is not very large, and when the slightly yellow skin is peeled off, it turns into a crystal ball as round and smooth as jade. Unfortunately, its production is not large, so people who love to eat it still cannot taste the genuine product even if they offer a huge price. As for the red sand loquat, there is more of it, but the taste is not as sweet and delicious as the white sand.</p>
<p>Bamboo on the Stone Wall</p>
<p>The Stone Wall is another name for Pan Chi Mountain. The Stone Wall Wu on the south side of the mountain, and the Stone Terrace outside the Wu, go straight into Taihu Lake. When climbing up and looking out on a clear day, the hazy light and shadows in Taihu Lake, the sand gulls and sailing boats, all fly onto the tables, truly a pleasure of touring. There are many bamboos on the mountain, with tall bamboos lining the road, greening the sleeves, and tourists mostly carve their nicknames on the bamboo. In a Ci poem by Yihong Lake, there is a line: "The mountain teaches to carve lone bamboo, cherish the clear tour and record the nickname." Writing here, I can't help but feel the emotion of Huang Lu.</p>
<p>Aftermath</p>
<p>The town of Guangfu is about sixty li away from Suzhou. The mountains Dengwei, Xuanmu, Tongbing, and Shi bi are guarded on the left and right. The 36,000 hectares of Taihu Lake are even more like a mirror spread out in front. The scenery is secluded and charming, and the products are abundant, truly a scenic area. It is a pity that in recent years, silkworm and mulberry farming has been unfavorable, and the fruits have also suffered from the harm of the weather, reducing the internal production. Therefore, the villages have gradually felt the recession, and coupled with the bandits of Taihu Lake, robbing and plundering, coming and going unpredictably, a group of villagers with a little savings have gradually moved to live in the town, so the atmosphere of that lovely scenic village has gradually increased with a strong component of desolation.</p>

<h3>["Two-Faced"]</h3>
<p>— Tu Yangci</p>
<p>["Two-Faced"] is the secret to the Chinese way of dealing with people, and a good recipe for handling the world. As long as a person can do things smoothly and not offend people on either side, even if someone deliberately makes things difficult for them occasionally, they will still greet them with a smile and show goodwill. Naturally, no one will come out to oppose them. This is the success of ["Two-Faced"], and also the victory of being a well-rounded friend. The gentlemen who have both fame and fortune today all know the essence of this.</p>
<p>National affairs are like personal affairs, and national affairs are precisely personal affairs. ["Two-Faced"] is a secret for a person to deal with people and a good recipe for handling the world, so naturally it can also be used in handling national affairs. Otherwise, being blindly upright will ultimately lead to losses. Fortunately, the current dignitaries understand this thoroughly and are particularly skilled in its use. Therefore, although the national crisis is becoming increasingly urgent, China can finally survive in the world.</p>
<p>Putting aside other things, just looking at this Sino-Japanese negotiation, our government has truly done its best to be ["Two-Faced"]. For example, when the Northeast Incident first broke out, on the one hand, it appealed to the League of Nations that Japan was being unreasonable, as if it were an enemy country, and on the other hand, it exchanged messages with Japanese envoys, courteously discussing its diplomacy. Although the Japanese army's shells destroyed the entire Northeast, our authorities never once turned their faces. Many people think that the authorities' attitude is uninspiring, but in fact this is the application of the ["Two-Faced"] policy.</p>
<p>The outbreak of the ["January 28th"] Incident saw the stubborn Japanese army destroy the prosperous Shanghai. The number of people who died under the iron hooves of the Japanese army is countless, and the property lost under the bombing of Japanese aircraft is countless. At this time, our government hurriedly moved to Luoyang to take refuge, while clenching its fists and [preparing for long-term resistance], it also enjoyed wine and conversation with Japanese diplomats, eventually leading to ["peaceful completion"], turning big things into small things. This is another application of the ["Two-Faced"] policy.</p>
<p>Currently, the Japanese army is launching a general offensive on Rehe. The news has spread, and the whole country is angry! However, while the government is [negotiating on one hand and resisting on the other], it seems that some people are still advocating continuing to sign the Chinese Commercial Treaty, which is about to expire. And they are even talking about ["mutual benefit"]! This is another application of the ["Two-Faced"] policy.</p>
<p>The completely national quintessence of ["Two-Faced"] has such great use. In this era of storms and torrential rain, the old and large China can still survive in East Asia, all thanks to the proper application of the ["Two-Faced"] policy by the great adults and gentlemen!</p>
<h3>The Beauty of Remote Imagination</h3>
<p>— Jia Shu</p>
<p>Is everyone in such a situation?</p>
<p>When in a foreign land, encountering a good day or a festive occasion, one will involuntarily feel lonely, think of home, and emit a wisp of leisurely poetic feeling!</p>
<p>Some of these wisps of poetic feeling are triggered by the scenery, with some associations; some are travelers missing home, thinking of the loveliness of their hometown, with some aspirations.</p>
<p>Many examples of such poetry of aspiration have been revealed by the ancients in beautiful lines of poetry! For example:</p>
<p>["In the middle of the third fifth night, the color of the new moon, the heart of an old friend two thousand miles away"]!</p>
<p>Seeing the clear moon, one will remember a friend two thousand miles away.</p>
<p>["Alone in a foreign land as a stranger, one thinks of relatives all the more on every festive occasion"]!</p>
<p>Living alone in a foreign land, seeing all the scenes of the festive season, one will involuntarily think of one's parents: these are all associations and memories. Those in the situation, because they feel a kind of poignant taste, are able to chant such lines of poetry.</p>
<p>If the ["poets"] who wrote these two lines of poetry had achieved their wish to return home at the time, they might not have felt so satisfied. When they hum these two lines of poetry again, they might not find it as tasty as when they were aspiring to their hometown in a foreign land. ["When unseen, preparing thousands of words; when met, all turn into short sighs and long lamentations!"]</p>
<p>This is from experience, showing the melancholy after the disillusionment of ["the beauty of remote imagination"].</p>
<p>This kind of ["beauty of remote imagination"] is the most poetic emotion of mankind.</p>
<h3>Visiting Prison</h3>
<p>— Li Huiying</p>
<p>[Looking for someone?]</p>
<p>[Yes.]</p>
<p>[Who are you looking for? Do you know their number?]</p>
<p>[Looking for Wu XX, number fifty XX.]</p>
<p>[What's your name? Where are you from?]</p>
<p>[My name is XXX, I'm from Jiangsu.]</p>
<p>[A relative?]</p>
<p>[A friend.]</p>
<p>[Okay, wait a moment.]</p>
<p>Following the guard's instructions, I walked into the gatehouse of XX Prison. Before I could even open my mouth to ask questions, the gatekeeper started asking me one question after another. I had no choice but to answer according to his questions, one by one. He looked to be about thirty years old, with a nose, eyes, and mouth on his head like everyone else; and hands and feet on his body. But there was one thing I felt was different about him from others, and that was his demeanor. Really, even after he finished asking me all those questions, his demeanor, which was different from even that of officials, was still present. Involuntarily, I suddenly felt that this place didn't seem to belong to the world at all.</p>
<p>[Got something? Let me take a look.] He looked at the paper bag I was holding and asked.</p>
<p>[Some books.]</p>
<p>[Books have to be left here for inspection first, can't just send them in.]</p>
<p>Naturally, I followed his instructions. Then, after leaving my name in the ledger, I followed him into the courtyard. This courtyard, which had not yet separated from the Earth, was opening its stern mouth at me, as if waiting to swallow me whole. Especially those armed prison guards, really frightened me: if I hadn't already stepped onto the platform, I really would have asked that gatekeeper, [Sorry, not feeling well, I won't visit today.] But I finally walked into the first department.</p>
<p>Then, to the second department. The faces of the people in this room were all extremely serious and fierce, and completely beyond what the gatekeeper and the gate guards could compare to. This suddenly reminded me of the painted faces and fanged clay statues I saw in temples when I was a child. The only difference between them was the height of their bodies and their clothes.</p>
<p>A square, paneled room, the size of which could only accommodate two people standing side by side at most, I was led by the prison guard to the front. Standing there, facing a round opening that connected to the inner room, a place that could only fit one person's face, I understood the position I was in, knew that this was where I would visit XX and speak a few words. [This is the place, don't move.] The prison guard ordered me, then turned to look at the blue-bottomed, white-lettered slogans written for the prisoners to see on the opposite wall.</p>
<p>Why would I move? Why would I move here? Wouldn't I bump into the paneled wall if I stretched out my hand?</p>
<p>From the crack in the panel, I could vaguely see two people standing on the inside of the round opening. I understood what they were doing.</p>
<p>The sound of shackles, gradually approaching and getting louder, naturally the sound of shackles. At the round opening, after the sound stopped, XX's face appeared.</p>
<p>[XX!] he exclaimed in surprise, as if he hadn't expected that I would come to see him at this time. His eyes were red. He bit his teeth, as if biting away all the pain, he stuttered, [You...are you...well?]</p>
<p>[I'm fine, are you okay? Do you need anything? Don't worry, the injustice will be cleared up one day. We are still trying to figure out a way for you. Do you have any letters from home?] I said all in one breath, and after that, I didn't know what to say, no, I couldn't say anything at all! Before coming here, I had prepared some words, but at this time I had forgotten them completely, and I couldn't remember them no matter how hard I tried. I did hear him say a lot of things. He wanted us not to worry too much about him, now there were more than just him wrongly imprisoned, this was something that couldn't be explained. He also said that things were still okay in prison, and we should definitely not let our friends worry about him, and he said other things, and later, two tears clearly squeezed out of his big eyes.</p>
<p>[You're fatter than before.] Having nothing to say, in order to avoid his sadness, I said this after a while. [I brought a few books this time, after they're inspected, you'll see them in a few days.] I remembered the books.</p>
<p>[Ah, that's great...]</p>
<p>[Alright!] Before he could finish speaking, the prison guard said fiercely and dragged him away. I didn't see his face clearly again, only heard the sound of shackles and his last words, [Goodbye then].</p>
<p>At this time, I didn't know what to do. Regardless of whether XX heard it or not, I shouted urgently across the partition, [Okay, we'll see you again.]</p>
<p>He left, and there was no sound at all. At this time, the prison guard who was looking at the slogans turned around. Although he didn't issue any orders, I could see from his eyes that he was urging me to leave. So, under the surveillance of the prison guard, I slowly walked out of the prison gate. [What exactly did he do, a young man who isn't even twenty years old?] Looking at the high prison walls, and thinking of the two tears squeezed out of XX's eyes and the sound of the shackles, I couldn't help but feel doubtful. I didn't understand, I couldn't explain it, but I knew deeply that in modern times, there were countless millions of people suffering from the same inexplicable things!</p>
<h3>The Adventures of the Black Girl in Her Search for God (9)</h3>
<p>— Written by George Bernard Shaw, Translated by Yi Xian</p>
<p>"Come down," said the little black girl. "You ought to know that gudgeons are only to be found close to the river. I was only trying a experiment. Come down."</p>
<p>"How can I come down?" said the shortsighted man, trembling. "I shall break my neck."</p>
<p>"How did you get up?" said the little black girl.</p>
<p>"I don't know," he replied, almost weeping. "It is enough to make one believe in miracles. I could not have climbed that tree; but here I am, and I can never get down again."</p>
<p>"A very interesting experiment, isn't it?" said the little black girl.</p>
<p>"A cruelly wicked experiment, you malicious girl," he groaned. "Please consider that you are endangering my life. Think how you can subject a delicately strung physiological organism like me to a violent shock without producing a simply fatal reaction on the heart. I shall never be able to sit on wood again as long as I live. Though I cannot count my pulse, I believe it is quite abnormal; and if I let go this bough, I shall fall like a stone."</p>
<p>"If you can dissect half a dog's brain without making it even wink, you needn't be afraid," she said composedly. "I think African magic is more powerful than your guessing from dogs. I said a word to you, and you climbed up a tree like a cat. You admit that was a miracle."</p>
<p>"Could you say another word to make me get down safely, you black sorceress?" he pleaded.</p>
<p>"That I could," said the little black girl. "There is a tree snake sniffing at the back of your neck."</p>
<p>The shortsighted man was on the ground in a twinkling. He landed prostrate; but he scrambled up at once, protesting "Don't suppose you have taken me in. I was not taken in. I knew perfectly well that you were inventing a snake to frighten me."</p>
<p>"But you were as frightened as if it had been a real snake," said the little black girl.</p>
<p>"I was not frightened," said the shortsighted man indignantly. "Not in the least."</p>
<h3>Random Jottings from Qu Lu</h3>
<p>— Zi Zhan</p>
<p>(7) Mr. Zhang Taiyan’s Madcap Philosophy</p>
<p>After Mr. Zhang Taiyan was released from prison in Shanghai, he immediately went to Japan, where he was warmly welcomed by the anti-Manchu revolutionaries, and was invited to be the chief editor of the *Min Bao* newspaper. Mr. Zhang described his life and aspirations at the welcome meeting, which was recorded in the sixth issue of the *Min Bao*. One passage on madness and neurosis is extremely insightful, although Mr. Zhang was merely trying to excuse himself. The text is in vernacular Chinese:</p>
<p>[Generally, when people are called mad by others, they definitely refuse to admit it, except for those carefree individuals like poets and painters who enjoy nature; they are a special case. Everyone else is the same. Only I, your brother, admit that I am mad and that I have a nervous disorder. Moreover, I am particularly happy to hear that I am mad and that I have a nervous disorder. Why is that? Generally speaking, extraordinary and bizarre arguments cannot be conceived by people without nervous disorders. Even if they could conceive them, they wouldn't dare to say them. After saying them, when faced with difficulties and hardships, only people with nervous disorders can persevere and insist on their own way. Therefore, great scholars and accomplished individuals in ancient times must have had nervous disorders to achieve their goals. Look at the Greek philosopher Socrates; wasn't he neurotic? And Rousseau, who proposed civil rights and freedom, jumping over a river to retrieve a dog—that was really neurotic. The founder of Islam, Muhammad, according to today's religious scholars, suffered from hypochondria. As for us Han Chinese, Xiong Tingbi of the Ming Dynasty had unparalleled military strategies in ancient times, but judging from his temperament, it was said that Xiong Tingbi was a madman. In modern times, Zuo Zongtang, though protecting the Manchu slaves and massacring his own people was not worth mentioning, his ingenious and victorious strategies were admirable. The strange stories of Zuo Zongtang's youth at Yuelu Academy are well known. Furthermore, Bismarck once shouted at a waiter in a hotel, and when there was no response, he started shooting. What kind of temperament is that? Looking closely, the talents, etiquette, achievements and careers of these six men all flowed from their nervous disorders. For this reason, I admit that I have a nervous disorder, and I also hope that all my comrades have some measure of nervous disorder. Recently, some people have said that so-and-so has a nervous disorder, and so-and-so also has a nervous disorder. In my opinion, I am not afraid of having a nervous disorder, but I am afraid that when wealth and fame appear before them, their nervous disorder will immediately be cured—that is truly undesirable! For those slightly higher, the tonic of wealth and fame may not cure their nervous disorder, but the poison of hardship and difficulty can still cure it. This is because their foundation is not solid, and they cannot achieve anything significant. I have tasted this poison the most. Counting from the year of Xu (dog), I have been investigated and arrested seven times. I was not caught six times, and I was only caught on the seventh time. The first three times were due to involvement in other matters, or a general arrest of new party members, not specifically for me. The last four times were all for expelling the Manchus and seeking independence. But I have not had a trace of regret in this whirlpool of hardship and difficulty. No matter what kind of poison you use, this nervous disorder cannot be cured. Perhaps you respect me because of this. If someone says that if everyone has a nervous disorder, things will be chaotic and there will be no order, but the nervous disorder I am talking about is not crude, reckless, random hitting and jumping. It is about loading meticulous and detailed thoughts into the nervous disorder. For example, if thought is cargo, then the nervous disorder is a steamship. Without thought, the empty nervous disorder is useless. Without a nervous disorder, can this thought move automatically?]</p>
<p>This speech was not included in Zhang Taiyan's book of vernacular writings, for reasons unknown. Thirty years ago, Mr. Zhang was a completely new figure, not only willing to write in vernacular Chinese, but also holding certain views that would likely shock even the current officials and powerful revolutionaries if they heard them today.</p>

<h3>A Worthy Death</h3>
<p>— Tian Fang</p>
<p>The newspaper reported the other day that a rickshaw puller, about forty years old, was pulling his rickshaw when he arrived near Sanpailou in this city. He parked his rickshaw on the side of the road, then sat on the footrest with his eyes closed, looking as if he were resting quietly. Unexpectedly, he breathed his last breath and died. Passersby noticed and reported it to the police station in charge. The reporter added the title: "Rickshaw Puller Dies in a Peculiar Way."</p>
<p>[Death] is actually a very ordinary thing. All living things cannot escape this stage. What is peculiar is not dying in Baolong Hospital or a mansion, but on the footrest of a rickshaw. But upon reflection, this is also very ordinary. In this day and age, no one can guarantee their life tomorrow. For example, if I say something wrong today, my head might be moved to another place tomorrow, or I might have a transparent hole pierced through my chest. Like our colleague Liu in Zhenjiang, he received the chairman's [governor's] favor and was sent to the list of historical figures. Who could have expected that? This is a small matter. Look at the newspaper reports that young girls in Gansu, seventeen or eighteen years old, don't even have pants to wear, and millions of people in the two Hunan provinces are victims of disaster. Who can guarantee their lives? In this era of cannibalism, everyone has the chance to be eaten. Of course, that doesn't include people. Like this old compatriot in his forties, although he had the strength to pull a rickshaw, he had lived for more than forty years and had not yet become a titled official, but only pulled a rickshaw for others. This is obviously a sign of weakness. Now, thanks to the [vast grace of the people], he is allowed to remain in the world, doing the labor of cattle and horses, and is granted a complete corpse, so that he is not eaten by others. This is already a great favor. Although dying on the footrest of a rickshaw might seem a bit peculiar to others, to say something comforting, it can also be said to be [dying in his own bed], which is far better than having one's head chopped off in some random [movement]. If this old man had any awareness, he should be able to rest in peace.</p>
<p>Alas, those who work diligently can die peacefully on a rickshaw, but those who attack with words and pens, will they not die without a proper place?</p>
<p>Literature and Art</p>
<p>The newspaper reported the other day that a Westerner named Norris, working for a shipping company, risked driving through dense fog to send a sick child to Shanghai for treatment. The child survived, and Chinese and Western newspapers competed to report the event, praising his benevolence and chivalry. Therefore, I wrote four five-character quatrains to praise him (Pei Jiesan). Riding the wind and rain, the whale exhales, filling the air. Obstructing the sky, choking the air, forcibly landing on the Wan River. The child suffers from a terrible illness, madness wants to devour him. Delaying until dawn, there is no way to return his soul. Benevolence originates from Heaven's decree, without distinction of race or class. Where can a savior be found? The father of Jesus has come back to life. The fog is heavy, obscuring the way, birds cannot fly in the sky. Driving the plane to rescue the sick child, he deserves widespread praise.

<h3>Drama</h3>
<p>— Hong Shui</p>
<p>Our school has decided to put on a play on the ninth.</p>
<p>H is naturally very thin and his appearance is particularly ugly. Coincidentally, Lao Wang is a burly man with a fat head and a snow-white, sturdy body. Almost every performance, they have become indispensable characters. The students all laugh at them as a naturally suited pair of Eastern Laurel and Hardy!</p>
<p>Indeed, they are not here to study, but to pursue enjoyment. Especially the general female actors (naturally female students), they are quite clever and can get by without even opening a book. Because of the principal's favor and the teachers' affection, passing the semester exams is not a problem at all.</p>
<p>It was a sunny afternoon after a long rain when they began rehearsing the script.</p>
<p>[Ladies and gentlemen! The Northeast has fallen, and only the loyal and brave volunteer army is recovering our territory, fighting a desperate battle with the Japanese devils! It is pitiful that they have little supplies of winter clothing and food, and not enough bullets to kill the enemy! How can they fight the violent Japanese invaders? Alas! Please donate some money to help them, this concerns the final fate of the Chinese nation's survival!] H plays the role of a donation team leader, dressed very plainly, standing in a restaurant, sincerely exhorting a young couple.</p>
<p>[Um!] The man makes a gesture of unwillingness to donate. He glances at the woman, then slowly shifts his gaze to H, only uttering an [Um].</p>
<p>[Although the donation is small, everyone's generous contributions will make a tower of sand!]</p>
<p>[Ah? What are you doing with him late at night?] The woman pretends to be annoyed and pulls on the man's sleeve. [You modern ladies have no concept of patriotism in your heads! You are willing to spend your money on powder, lipstick, and high heels, flowing into the pockets of foreigners; you are doomed to be immersed in a life of luxury and promiscuity, you are truly future slaves to the nation! Ah, you slaves to the nation!]</p>
<p>[·····] Funnily enough, after H cursed the women on stage who only knew how to enjoy themselves and had no national consciousness, she actually cried softly and coquettishly.</p>
<p>[Hey! Miss Jin, why are you crying? Hahaha.] Mr. Wang, assuming the role of director, asked with a loud laugh.</p>
<p>[I'm not doing it anymore, absolutely not!]</p>
<p>[What does it matter? This is just exposing the weaknesses of women in modern society, so that the general audience can be awakened...]</p>
<p>[I won't... who wants to be a slave to the nation?] She still sobbed: [I am a citizen of the great Republic of China, I am willing to die to seek survival for her...]</p>
<p>[I'm sorry, Miss Jin, although this is an emotional reaction, it shows that you are not as absurd and decadent as the women in the play! In short, I apologize for not considering your personality before rehearsing.] [I will never participate in performances again!]</p>
<p>[Er! Let's go have coffee and see a movie after the rehearsal.] In the end, Director Wang had to coax her with a smiling face.</p>
<p>[Let's go together.] Lao Wang chimed in.</p>
<p>[Let's all go together!]</p>
<p>H saw Miss Jin revealing a slight smile on her rosy cheeks, which were covered with tears, and then he took a deep breath of the cold air he had been holding for a long time!</p>
<h3>Perilous as a Candle in the Wind</h3>
<p>— Qing Mu</p>
<h3>Spring</h3>
<p>— Yi Ping</p>
<p>Although it is drizzling outside the window, the atmosphere of spring has already arrived in the world.</p>
<p>The unknown small flowers in the yard are budding; a row of evergreen holly trees are also secretly sprouting tender green leaves. The rainy weather creates a suffocating atmosphere, as uncomfortable as the plum rain season. Miss S stares out the window, through the misty haze, at the city's buildings, or perhaps Muning says she is dreaming beautiful dreams. Suddenly, she straightens her delicate, weak waist, lowers the window curtain, and subconsciously walks towards the dressing table.</p>
<p>A late spring girl is revealed in the mirror? She tidies her messy hair and thinks about her past romantic life. A girl surrounded by erotic temptations, relying on her youth, wins the passionate pursuit of many men and uses her social skills to play with them. Every day, before she gets out of bed, the reception room is already filled with flattering young men. Whoever's request Miss S grants today will consider it an unparalleled honor. Therefore, wherever her feet go, there is always a handsome companion, following her like a puppy.</p>
<p>With each change of spring, she stares blankly at her fading youth in the mirror, tightly knitting her brows, as if hating where her youth has gone. Sometimes, she deliberately tightens the edge of her pajamas, raises her right leg, and her left leg takes the opportunity to rotate halfway on the floor. Her plump back, set against the swaying pajamas, makes her confident that she still has some enchanting magic. So she thinks of the [little brother] she used to play with. She hopes that the [little brother] will throw himself into her arms again, which would be an unparalleled honor.</p>
<p>She imagines it contentedly, her heart feeling like it is floating in the air, and her limbs also seem to be rising with her body. Suddenly, two blushes fly to her temples, as if she has caught the answer to where her youth has gone. As she smiles slightly to herself, the maid pushes open the door and says: [Mr. Xiao called to say that he will pick up his friend who is returning from abroad today...]</p>
<p>The wrinkles on her forehead hide her slight smile. She knows that youth can never return, but can't it give her a moment of pleasure again? Two drops of water slowly hang from her eyelashes; her heart greedily flies back to the scene from a few years ago.</p>
<p>Although it is drizzling outside the window, the atmosphere of spring has already arrived in the world.</p>
<h3>XX Battle XX</h3>
<p>— Yong Qing</p>
<p>Old Zhang ran past Yiyuan. He saw that the ticket booths on both sides were packed with people. The loud cries of sports commentators in red and green, and the long line of cars, immediately made him realize:</p>
<p>Oh! Today is Saturday, isn't there a fierce soccer game?</p>
<p>The 21st Road public bus was doing good business, filling car after car with passengers, stopping in front of Yiyuan, and then scrambling to get off and squeeze to the front of the ticket booths. There were also quite a few young soccer fans running breathlessly from the Xiahfei Road area!</p>
<p>On the north and south grandstands, rows and rows of heads were quickly increasing. In less than two hours, it was already packed without gaps.</p>
<p>They were excitedly waiting for the [battle] to begin. Old Zhang lowered his head and crawled into his small and dirty office, constantly thinking: [Why are there so many people going to the games? Look at them, they are not afraid of the expensive ticket prices, one yuan, two yuan! Is Shanghai in an economic panic after all?</p>
<p>Our Northeast Volunteer Army is fighting desperately on the front lines, and our compatriots in the Northeast are fighting desperately on the front lines! Why is it always so difficult to raise donations in the rear?!! When will there be such enthusiastic generosity, when will there be such enthusiastic scrambling!</p>
<p>The more Lao Zhang thought about it, the more uncomfortable he felt, and the more confused he became. He wanted to open the Shen Bao to relieve his boredom, but he saw:</p>
<p>The large headline in the sports news was: [East China battles Agal]</p>
<p>The small headline in the domestic news was: [Volunteer Army battles Japanese cavalry]</p>
<p>Alas!! Are the Chinese youth really living in a drunken dream? No, no, they are saving the country without forgetting entertainment!</p>

<p>Clerk Correspondence</p>
<h3>Uneasy Conscience</h3>
<p>— Wu Jiang</p>
<p>Editor:</p>
<p>I don't know how to speak politely, but I am sure you will not refuse to answer my question because I am not polite. What I am asking is:</p>
<p>Last year, I unintentionally fell in love with my cousin and proposed to her. Because of a temporary misunderstanding, she quickly used [already betrothed] as an excuse to reject me. At that time, I undoubtedly suffered a major blow, felt life was meaningless, and wanted to commit suicide. However, my parents, who live in the countryside, found out and quickly arranged a marriage for me. At that time, I was in a confused state, so I vaguely agreed. Until January of this year, my cousin, dissatisfied with her blind marriage arranged entirely by her parents, broke off the engagement. At the same time, she began to realize my feelings and confessed to me. My heart is wavering again, and I want to cancel the engagement I have already agreed to; however, my conscience feels uneasy, because if she had the same single-minded intention as I had for my cousin, and heard this unfortunate news, wouldn't she suffer a mental blow just like me, and perhaps even...? If I don't cancel the engagement, then my lifelong happiness will be sacrificed entirely! I am in a dilemma, and I hope that you will generously give me your advice and use a space in your newspaper to answer me in detail. Wishing you progress! From Wu Jiang.</p>
<p>Editor's Note: After reading Mr. Wu's letter, I feel that his heart is a bit too wavering. From the letter, at least the following three points can be assumed. (1) When Mr. Wu proposed to his cousin, the reason she rejected him was mostly because she was [already betrothed]; at this time, she did not have a proper understanding of Mr. Wu; at the same time, she had not found sufficient reason to strongly reject the fiancé arranged by her parents for her. In order to avoid trouble, she simply rejected Mr. Wu, making him give up and find another way out; this attitude is very aboveboard. (2) Her motive for breaking off the engagement with her fiancé this time was entirely because she was dissatisfied with this blind marriage, and it had nothing to do with Mr. Wu; however, after breaking off the engagement, when she started choosing a good match, she recalled the previous situation. (3) His current fiancée, although not as pleasing to him as his cousin, causing his heart to waver, she should not be absolutely incompatible, because after all, he agreed to it. Therefore, we believe that Mr. Wu may as well use the words [already engaged] to reject his cousin [treating her in the same way she treated him], there is nothing wrong with that; moreover, this can also make her give up and find another lover. As for the above three assumptions, the first one will not be wrong at all. As for the second one, Mr. Wu's cousin, perhaps because she did not know that Mr. Wu was [already engaged], so her breaking off the engagement has something to do with Mr. Wu. But this is her wishful thinking, how can she reject someone and not allow them to find another way out? As for the third one, even if his fiancée is unfortunately too bad, but because he has already agreed to it, he has a temporary obligation to endure it in law and morality.</p>

<h3>A Scholarly Family (Continuation 17)</h3>
<p>— Wang Zhongxian</p>
<p>Ruo Hua fixed her eyes, looked at Dai Qiu, and asked sadly: [Good girl, haven't you always hated him? How come...]</p>
<p>Dai Qiu answered resolutely: [Yes, I have always hated him, I hate him for falling in love with you. Now he has sworn that after loving me, he will never love anyone else, so I don't hate him anymore!]</p>
<p>Ruo Hua listened in stunned silence, still unwilling to let go of her hand.</p>
<p>You Zhong desperately wanted to break free. Ruo Hua, seeing that she could not hold on, started to shout madly: [This is the murderer who killed my son-in-law! Help!]</p>
<p>You Zhong warned her in a low voice:</p>
<p>[You are the evil woman who murdered my brother! If the police come, no one will benefit. I advise you to let go!]</p>
<p>Ruo Hua disregarded everything and continued to shout for help. Suddenly, many footsteps came from outside. You Zhong panicked and kicked her lower abdomen fiercely. She felt the pain, clutched her stomach, and sat on the ground. You Zhong pulled Dai Qiu out, running into the family's servants, who had heard the cries for help and came to see what was going on. You Zhong said to them:</p>
<p>[Madam has taken ill suddenly, the young lady and I are going to see a doctor.]</p>
<p>You Zhong deceived the family and flew out the door with Dai Qiu. Who knew that when they ran to the wall gate, they were grabbed by the leg by a small child, who lay on the ground and refused to let go. You Zhong lowered his head and recognized him as Xia Maosheng, the adopted son who was driven out of the house by Ruo Hua. You Zhong, annoyed that he was blocking the way, picked up his suitcase and slammed it repeatedly on his head. He burst into tears on the ground. Sang Aqiang and Ali rushed up together, saying that You Zhong was bullying Ali's brother, and they grabbed You Zhong. You Zhong tried to break free with force. The tailors and clerks all put down their needles and threads and surrounded him. Before long, the police came and arrested You Zhong and Dai Qiu together.</p>
<p>Once You Zhong entered prison, there was no hope of escape. Maosheng actually hired a lawyer and accused You Zhong of having an affair with Ruo Hua, causing his father, Zhongnan, to be missing and his life in danger, requesting justice. As a result of the trial, neither You Zhong nor Ruo Hua could escape the law. The deeply devoted Dai Qiu, because the root of the disaster originated from herself, was willing to go to jail with You Zhong and confessed that she was also one of the instigators in the murder of Zhao Jialian. Zheng Jiping was naturally released. Maosheng returned to the Xia surname and was considered the heir of Xia's second branch.</p>
<p>Before Maosheng was driven out of the house, Boss Sang knew that he would be profitable in the future, so he secretly kept him in his care. It happened that the Xia family had a series of internal strife, and Aqiang took advantage of the situation and promoted this worthless bastard to be the legitimate heir. The Xia family had a total of five branches. Both Bodong and Bei had descendants, but these two were useless cowards, and when they heard about the changes in the second branch, they dared not ask for information. They all adopted a [turtle-head strategy].</p>
<p>Maosheng inherited the family property, but the real power was in Sang Aqiang's hands. If Maosheng wanted to use money, he had to withdraw it from Ali. They also forced Maosheng to write a mortgage deed for all of the property and allowed him to go out to prostitute, gamble, and smoke. In a few years, he returned to being a vagrant, and the scholarly family of the Xia surname was reduced to a garment shop managed by merchants. There was still a large signboard of Sangqiangji hanging at the door. (The End)</p>
<p>Announcement: Mr. Wang Zhongxian's famous novel [A Scholarly Family] will be followed by Mr. Ting's translation of the long novel [Readers please note.] from tomorrow onwards.</p>

<p>Movie Special</p>
<h3>The Story of the Tomboy, Cora Sue</h3>
<p>— Written by Xing Zhi</p>
<p>Before Cora Sue went to Hollywood, she lived in New York with her mother. She was only five years old at the time. Her mother took her to see [The Champ] last year. After returning home, she imitated the expressions and mannerisms of Jackie Cooper on the screen. Her mother found it amusing and told her stories about Jackie Cooper. When she heard that Jackie Cooper was very famous and earned a lot of money in Hollywood, she insisted on going to Hollywood. Her mother asked her what she would do there, and she replied that she would do what Jackie Cooper did. Her mother tried to dissuade her, but she just kept demanding to go. After a few days of her nagging, her mother had no choice but to take her to Hollywood.</p>
<p>They lived in Hollywood for two months. Although Cora Sue's mother firmly believed that her daughter had Jackie Cooper's talent, she couldn't find an opportunity. One day, she ran into an old girlfriend on the street. After chatting, she learned that her friend worked at Universal Studios. She asked her friend if the film company hired children of five or six years old. By chance, Universal Studios was looking to hire child stars. So, she asked her friend to introduce Cora Sue. After contact, she was hired by Universal Studios.</p>
<p>On her first day at Universal, Cora Sue began co-starring with comedians ZaSu Pitts and Slim Summerville in [The Unexpected Father]. Without much instruction, she seemed like an experienced actress. Her performance on the first day shocked all of Hollywood.</p>
<p>After [The Unexpected Father] was completed, Cora Sue acted just like Clara Bow, and she earned the nickname "Tomboy," rivaling Jackie Cooper's "Champ."</p>
<p>After finishing [The Unexpected Father], Paramount borrowed Cora Sue from Universal to star in [The Strange Case of Clara Deane]. The director told her to play an orphan, and she did so, portraying a pitiful orphan perfectly.</p>
<p>Then, MGM offered a large sum of money to borrow Cora Sue from Universal to co-star with Norma Shearer and Clark Gable in Smilin' Through. At this time, although she had only been in the film industry for two months, she was already working with world-renowned stars.</p>
<p>Before MGM's film was finished, Warner Bros. wanted to hire her to star in Edward G. Robinson's Silver Dollar.</p>
<p>Cora Sue had a special talent: she was good at crying realistically. Edward G. Robinson's character in Silver Dollar died in the final scene, so they needed a child who could cry well. It was hard to find anyone other than Cora Sue for that role. On the day of filming the scene, Edward died, and Cora Sue cried bitterly, moving everyone to tears. After the scene was filmed, Edward jumped up, ready to go home. Cora Sue took Edward's hand and said, "Goodbye, Mr. Edward, but I'm very upset because you died!" Edward and Bebe Daniels were speechless with laughter.</p>
<p>Audience Opinion</p>
<h3>On [City Nights]</h3>
<p>— Sent from Suzhou by Ying</p>
<p>City Nights is the latest masterpiece from the Lianhua No. 1 Film Studio. I was fortunate enough to see it early at the Da Guangming Cinema in Suzhou.</p>
<p>The acting of the lead actors, Ruan Lingyu (the daughter) and Jin Yan (the son of a wealthy family), has already been praised by society, so there is no need to introduce it again. Secondly, Li Keng (the little brother) is also a rising new child star. Liu Jiqun (the cousin) is passable. The coolie, Ji, although very ill, does not appear ill on his face. He is still quite plump, and the makeup seems to be lacking consideration.</p>
<p>Regarding the technical aspects, the lighting seems a bit dim. There are too many night scenes, but it's still okay.</p>
<p>The screenwriter's skill is truly ingenious. He doesn't let go of any detail of the subject he wants to depict, showing the contrast between rich and poor everywhere. He can highlight the disparity between classes in small places, with the oppressed crying out.</p>
<p>In addition, regarding the director, there is indeed not a single flaw to be found from beginning to end. In particular, before the coolie and his daughter arrive home, the house has already collapsed due to the rain, and the youngest son hides under the table laughing. This not only makes the audience feel the child's humor but also makes the viewers shed tears of sympathy.</p>
<p>The entire film is about 1,200 feet long and depicts a fragment of the two different lives of the rich and poor classes. Considering everything about the film, it has surpassed previous records. Although it cannot be compared with the best works in Europe and America due to environmental limitations, it is enough to overwhelm many imported films.</p>
<p>This year is the year of national goods, and everyone should promote domestic films, especially since this domestic film is worth promoting.</p>
<h3>Talking About [The Wickham Mystery]</h3>
<p>— Guo Shenghong</p>
<p>The Sherlock Holmes series of masterpieces by Clive Brook is a thrilling detective film mixed with romance, while The Wickham Mystery, shown by Carlton, is also a detective masterpiece, but it is even more thrilling than the Sherlock Holmes series, and as terrifying and unbearable to watch as Frankenstein.</p>
<p>The plot briefly describes five bizarre murders occurring in a row in a sleeping car, leaving people in a fog, difficult to grasp. Later, relying on a clue from a small cigarette, a newspaper reporter and the police investigate and solve the case one by one.</p>
<p>The director of [The Wickham Mystery] is indeed very clever. He can direct the actors in the plot as he pleases. When it comes to the actors, of course, the most experienced one, Henry Ainley, should be mentioned. The plot is originally terrifying and tense, touching the heart. Now, with the addition of Henry Ainley's experienced performance, [The Wickham Mystery] is much more colorful. As for the supporting roles, Beatrix Thomson is quite commendable, allowing Henry Ainley to fully develop his great talent.</p>
<p>The sound recording and dialogue are very clear. The set design can be considered the essence of the entire play. When it comes to the murders occurring one after another in a speeding train, it does indeed make the audience's emotions tense and vibrate along with the minds of the characters in the play.</p>
<p>[Adored] is a French-language operetta romance film produced by Ufa. Its French name is Le vainqueur. We already recognized the female lead, Käthe von Nagy, in the film [The Girl and the Film]. The image shows a scene from the film, which will be released soon at the Nanjing Grand Theater.</p>
<h3>Violette to Come to Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Xia</p>
<p>Ms. Violette was originally a very famous singing and dancing star in Hong Kong. Her performances on the screen for us were only in two Lianhua films, one is [Two Stars in the Milky Way] and the other is [The Overseas Orphan]. At that time, they received good reviews in various newspaper supplements. But there have been no works since.</p>
<p>Recently, I received a letter from someone in Guangdong, stating that after Violette returned to Guangdong, she married a Mr. Long from that area. Recently, Long became acquainted with a woman surnamed Mou and neglected Violette. Although Violette tried to persuade him in every way, Long was stubborn and wouldn't wake up. Recently, they often resorted to violence at the slightest disagreement. Violette, unable to bear the abuse, hired a lawyer to sue the court for divorce. The court has now ruled in favor of her request, and it is said that Violette told people that she will go to Shanghai to resume her film career.</p>
<h3>Warner Bros.' Giant Film</h3>
<p>— Rong</p>
<p>[42nd Street]</p>
<p>[42nd Street] is a new film being produced by Warner Bros. The content completely depicts the inside story of the film industry and many miniature figures of the film industry. The director is Lloyd Bacon, son of the late Frank Bacon.</p>
<p>Warner Bros. originally planned to have a full cast of talent participate in the film. Such as Warren William, Bebe Daniels, George Brent, Keeler, Dick Powell, and Warner Oland etc. were all on the list of approximately nine people, but because many actors had slight conflicts during production, they had to be replaced by others, and Warner Baxter was borrowed from Fox to replace Warren William, and Bebe Daniels replaced Ruby Keeler. After many important actors were decided, a lot of effort was also put into finding talent for the singing and dancing aspects. Out of more than 400 women, only 100 beautiful ones were selected to serve as dancers. In addition to Bebe Daniels, there are two singing stars who are worth mentioning. One is Ruby Keeler, who is making her debut, and is the wife of the great singer Al Jolson. The other is Busby Berkeley, who has performed many times in Eddie Cantor's musical films.</p>
<p>In order to urge their efforts, manager Warner gathered many dancers together to give a speech, saying: "We will start filming this film tomorrow, and we plan to complete it within six weeks." At the same time, he also encouraged them, saying that they should dance until they can't move before resting. It can be seen that this performance is very serious.</p>
<h3>Introducing [Wild Torrent]</h3>
<p>— Jiang Qing</p>
<p>Although the Star Film Company has given us many brilliant and successful works in the past, there are still some shortcomings in terms of consciousness and skill. [Wild Torrent] is a new work that director Cheng Bugao considers to be his most successful, and it is also a work that marks the era of Star, so how can we not pay special attention to it?</p>
<p>[Wild Torrent] is set against the backdrop of the Yangtze River flood that occurred in our country the year before last, expressing the suffering of the peasant masses. They struggle against the raging torrents and fight against the evil forces of local tyrants and landlords, mixed with some love stories between men and women.</p>
<p>The director's skill is very commendable. The flexible use of the camera is also admirable. The female lead, Hu Die, works very hard, and Gong Jianong and Xia Peizhen are also suitable for their characters.</p>
<p>In terms of set design, in one scene, hundreds of extras抢着築堤in the floodwaters, and although it is an artificial set, it is probably not much different from the real thing. In addition, the vast expanse of water is a rare real scene.</p>
<p>In summary, [Wild Torrent] is a rare masterpiece in domestic films, and it really shows a change in the style of Star Film Company.</p>
<h3>After Seeing the Bright Moon Opera Company</h3>
<p>— Kai Xiu</p>
<p>Since the Bright Moon Opera Company began performing at the Beijing Theater, it has been quite praised by the audience. So, I also thought it was necessary to appreciate it. Ms. Wang Renmei had already become popular for her singing and expressive features after the release of the film [Wild Rose]. Now that she is performing on stage in person, it is even more amazing. Ms. Li Lili was originally a star with a healthy physique and deep expressions, so the song [Five Minutes Rest] that she squeezed out from her pearly throat in [The Wedding Night] was especially moving. Ying Yin's solo performance was also good, but the song [In the Night Garden] was too 평평한, and there was no way to bring out her high-pitched singing voice. Hu Jia and others' synchronized dance was neat and spectacular. As for the singing aspect, it was also very good. Especially in the [Wild Rose] drama, the little girl who played the role of the maid really sang no less well than Wang and Li. Although the music is simple, the harmony and charm of the piano and violin ensemble are also very harmonious and charming, earning the audience's praise.</p>
<p>In short, I had a very good impression after watching the Bright Moon Opera Company this time. At the same time, in culturally naive China, such progress in singing and dancing is indeed very promising for the future. (Proceeds donated to aid the Northeast Volunteer Army)</p>
<p>Film Novel</p>
<h3>Street Beauty Hunting Record Walking Down Broadway (9)</h3>
<p>— Yu Qing</p>
<p>After a while, Millie and Mona came in and saw Punchie lying on the bed in a daze, knowing that Punchie must have been bullied. Millie understood in her heart that she was sorry for Punchie. Mona was a heroine among women. She quickly ran to the room where James and Mark lived and said to James, "I won't agree to you bullying that poor girl. You must take out money to support her." Mark laughed loudly beside him. He said to James, "Didn't I tell you? These women are not easy to mess with. You still say Punchie doesn't want your money." Before Mark finished speaking, Mona punched him in the face, knocking him unconscious. She said, "You bastard, this is all your doing. You better be careful. If he doesn't take out the money, I'll ask you. You can only fool that idiot. I don't think of you as anything great." She said and left.</p>
<p>After a while, Millie hurried over again. Mark said to James, "See? They're coming one by one." But Millie was relatively easy to deal with. She saw James and admitted that what she said yesterday was completely a lie, and Punchie was completely a good person. Before she could say anything further, Mark picked her up and pushed her out the door. Millie was yelling and闹着 outside the door. James and Mark ignored her, and she left after a while of闹着.</p>
<p>After Millie left, Mark patted James on the shoulder and advised him not to be angry because of unworthy women. He said, "Tonight is Christmas Eve. We should go out and enjoy ourselves." James initially refused, but then Mark put his hat on for him, put his coat on for him, and pushed and pulled him out. James had no choice but to go out with Mark. But halfway there, James saw Mark's many disreputable friends, looked down on Mark very much, and discovered that Mark had been deceiving his friends, so James parted ways with Mark and wanted to go home alone.</p>
<p>James was alone on the road, heading back to his residence. As he passed in front of Punchie's house, he felt quite reluctant. He looked up at Punchie's window, imagining that she must also be sitting alone in her room, spending her lonely Christmas Eve. Suddenly, he heard a loud explosion from the house where Punchie lived. Suddenly, a cloud of black smoke and flames shot straight out of the roof. Something exploded, and a fire broke out. James initially leaned against the streetlight pole in front of the house, lost in thought. The explosion shook the iron pole of the streetlight, waking James up. James rushed upstairs, disregarding his own safety. He didn't remember what happened after that. (To be continued)</p>
