<h3>法德關係之推移與世界經濟恐慌之强</h3>
<p>— 英·</p>
<p>自意大利倡議基本改組國聯而歐洲各國外交使者倥偬活動秘密接治。奔走馳驅。往來如織。頓覺歐局之壁壘。格外森嚴矣夫大陸各國之截爲兩橛。由來已久。於今尤烈。一則以維持現狀爲原則。一則以打破現狀爲有利。屬於前者爲法比波捷諸國。屬於後者則有德意諸國。獨英國則屈伸進退。因時變化。之抑揚輕重於二者之間。而其關键。則又以法德兩强對立關係之如何發展爲轉移焉。</p>

<p>法國立場。自始至終。極爲明顯。其唯一企圖。只在乎構成包圍德國之陣線而尤以結合中歐與國成一反德大集團爲基調。遠如小恊約國之聯結近如法俄不侵犯條約之成立固皆爲英意漸與離異以後之代用品而自德意沆瀣一氣以來。法國對於中東諸同情國之關係。尤形親密如本月羅捷兩外長在加斯丘之談話。旣確認國聯之不可侵犯。日昨法捷兩外長在巴黎之會晤則包羅尤廣。綜其要點。約有四端。（一）法不對單獨談話（二）德國不得復置軍備。（三）軍縮會議不得在日内瓦以外舉行。（四）修改盟約須有滿塲一致之决議。用意已甚明瞭。且法外長彭古。傳將於最近期間出游捷克羅馬尼亞波蘭諸國。甚至俄都莫斯科。亦爲其預擬游行之目的地。則其包圍德國之策劃更覺照然若揭雖欲緩立法俄親善關係。以圖暫掩跡象。亦不可得矣　　夫法德對立關係。旣臻如此緊張之程度而其根本　結實由於法德堅持歐洲統治領導權之鬭爭。更爲世界經濟恐慌日深之自然結局蓋各國資本主義制度發展至於今日。生産過剩之恐慌愈。甚則市場分割之鬭爭愈烈彼法德之爭。相激相盪捭縱横。以形成歐洲政局隂霾密布呈山雨欲來之勢者。豈有他哉。亦爲世界經濟恐慌之一角之反映而已。於此之時所最足以引起世人極大之注意者。則爲歐洲政局之動盪愈甚。即蘇聯之外交地位愈形重要。法之於俄。固早已締結相當關係。意之於俄。近亦力圖接近俄德關係曾經調和。卒告失敗。此爲法國之所稍可安心者。近法國航空部空特氏於其論日蘇關係之際。謂蘇聯之空軍力量。足以使荒木躊躇顧慮其意蓋爲蘇聯之所以力能攝服鄰邦左右時局地位日形重要者。無非由於空軍建設之勝利。則蘇聯地位爲各國所重視。不可想見哉。</p>

<h3>閩浙邊境接觸聲中滬閩電報仍通　惟商報因擁擠較前延緩</h3>
<p>新聲社云、鄰近浙邊之閩北浦城建寗等處、前傳閩方所謂人民革命軍、已與中央軍開始接觸說、但上海福州間有線電報仍通行無阻、該線即經過浙江之江山、越仙霞嶺、而經浦城建陽建甌（即建寗）者、倘雙方正式接觸、電線勢必中斷也、惟滬閩間商報頗延、往往有逾二小時以上者、據電報局消息、該路電線、本以一線專供滬閩間直達通報之用、餘爲經過各地區間通報之用、因近日江山浦城建寗等處、報極擁擠、原有電線、不敷應用、故時將直達線移作區間線用、以爲調劑、致福州往來商報較前延緩云、</p>
<h3>前缐接觸在卽　　閩軍紛向霞浦推進</h3>

<h3>察綏分設自治區府</h3>

<h3>此次運動謡言自破</h3>
<p>黄氏繼稱、本人在内蒙勾留、達兩閲月、該處氣候雖寒、但因空氣乾燥之故、並不如想像之嚴寒、内蒙同胞、均係遊牧生活、早來夕往、居處不定、五人之築居、尤不多見、行政敎育等等設施、根本上還談不到、此次要求自治運動之動機、非常純誠、謠傳有如何背景云云、今當不攻自破、</p>

<p>新任菲律濱副總督漢敦夫婦、於昨日下午五時、乘坐大來公司胡佛總統號輪、由美抵滬、漢氏爲美國密歇根大學董事、並曾在該校担任政學敎授多年、對於政治學極有研究、故被推爲世界政治之威權者、漢氏並擅長演説、本埠密歇根大學問學會、特於昨晚、在香港路銀行公會、設宴歡迎、并請漢氏演説、聞漢氏今晨仍乘原輪赴菲履新、</p>

<p>昨據國際貿易局局長何炳賢·及指導處主任季澤晋、發表國貨在南洋不能暢銷之原因云、中國國貨近年以來、已日見發達、各項日用品類、漸能仿造歐美、行銷國内、惟於南洋各處、當地僑胞、雖愛用國貨、而官廳與人民、對於中國國貨、雖非常贊許、祇以種種關係、國貨之行銷該地、未能發逹、最近據當地領事報告、其困難原因、大抵如下、（一）因國内工廠、尙在萌芽時期、不能作大規模之生産、故成本尙高、加以運費等等開支、其價格多在日貨之上、而不能與之競爭、（二）因國内工廠對海外定貨人、不能予以較長時期之經濟活動、貨物一　、須以現欵提貨、常因經濟週轉不靈、而瞠目無法及之、日貨則不然、定貨人欲定若干貨物、儘能源源寄來、至於貨價、則可於六個月後匯付、（三）因國内尚無輪船直達南洋、故運費高昻、（四）因南洋尙無華人自辦之銀行以週轉金融、有此數因、故經營國貨之人、常因無利可圖、中途放棄是誠國貨前途之障碍、而不能與人競爭之原因云、</p>

<h3>請願目的</h3>
<p>爲籲請迅卽制止税務署及省税局違章、重徴七省特區域内福建土烟葉刨製之烟絲、</p>
<p>以免糾紛、而恤商艱事、</p>
<h3>經過事實</h3>
<p>竊敝會會員經營之福建皮絲烟、大部份産自閩西永定、因地利關係、由汕頭或厦門運輸而來、自鈞部施行七省土烟葉特税新章以還、</p>
<p>福建方面一部份業着手舉辦、（附呈土烟葉完税照、）惟永定尙有一部份因剿匪關係、迄未實行、故舊有之烟酒税、則仍照舊徴收、·九月間運入本區域内之烟絲、税務署仍勒令補納土烟葉特稅、嗣經敝會陳明事理、反復解釋、始訂定暫行補税退税辦法四條、斯時敝會以事屬暫時、忍痛退補、不意税務署得寸欲尺、近忽變本中厲、藉閩省政變秩序混亂爲詞、令於本年十二月七日起、進口烟絲、須照非特區運入特區論、勒逼重徴特税、竟將以前訂定税補税辦法四條、完全推翻、</p>
<h3>制止理由</h3>
<p>閩省旣經钧部明令劃人七省特區、自應照特税徴收章程第七條之規定、一刨成烟絲、供人吸用者、暫免徴收烟絲税、一至謂政局變亂、此係地方問題、决不能因一時局部爭執、率爾變更國家所定重大之税章、且敝業連所内受變亂頻仍之影響、外遭洋烟盛行之打撃、内外交迫、民不聊生若再層層榨取、則數十萬所恃區區國貨謀生之災黎、勢將束手待斃、基上理由、敬陳節略如右、迫候面示祇遵云云、</p>
<h3>金晳家屬　　昨請法捕房負責索回　　金現仍押滬是否將解日不定日領如再延宕决申訴於國際</h3>
<p>歐亞社云、自由警在法租界非法逮捕已入華籍之韓人金晳案發生後、本埠各公團及金氏親屬、以此事關係我國主權甚巨、爰一致聲請市政府與駐滬法領、向日領嚴重交涉、從速釋回、截至現在、日領仍無切實答復、昨歐亞社記者、因聞外僑方面消息、謂日領將於日内、派警解押金晳送歸該國裁判、特走訪金氏親友陳陽李世昌兩氏、詢以一切、兹將所得詳情分誌如下、</p>
<h3>金尙押滬難免解日</h3>
<p>首據金氏親友陳李兩君答稱、金氏現仍覊押在本埠崔氏因徇其函索、親送日用物品、曾見金氏、面容較憔悴、惟日警監視甚嚴、不准交談一語、但按日本法律、領事館覊押人犯、不得超過二十九日、如逾期不釋、卽行解往本國辦理、故本人等自金氏於上月二十二日被捕覊押以來、深慮其死難卜、爰一再請求中法當局力予營救、並得樓允梅·徐傑·駱肇新·諸律師、電請各公團、羣起力爭、最近更電請蔣委員長分令交涉、務使金哲得早復自由、脱離險境</p>
<h3>金父昨函請法捕房</h3>
<p>金哲父金永鐸昨具函請求法捕房負責向日領索回、原函云、（上略竊鄙人曁于哲、早於民國十八年歸化中國、執行有國籍許可證書、並在法租界居住多年、憶去年鄙人父子曾遭日領署之非法逮捕、嚴辭鞫訊、其横蠻兇惡之態、及今思之、猶令人不寒而慄、曾幾何時、而鄙人之子金晢、又於本年十一月二十二日、被貴捕房助同日領署、無端逮捕、轉解日領事署、非法覊押、迄逾兩旬、生死莫卜、雖經鄙人委托代表、提示國籍許可證書、趨前交涉、乃貴捕房諉稱、當時金晢在捕房供稱明鮮籍、以致有此誤會云云、查鄙人與子之已轉入華籍、於去年被捕時交涉有案、而中西報紙、更宣載甚詳、此次被捕、斷不致再稱朝鮮籍、其爲貴捕房諉過卸責亳無疑義、且現經鄙人提出國籍歸書、則本件事實、已臻明瞭、誤會全釋、應由貴捕房負責索回、乃迭經要求、一味諉延、顯屬故意蹂躪、按照關於上海法租界内設置中國法院之協定、貴捕房應負濫行警權之責、而此後租界居民失所保障、亦非貴捕房所以保護之至意、鄙人旣居住法租界、而金晢之被捕、又出貴捕房之協助、則於事實證明、無辜被捕之金晢、貴捕房自應負責索回、相應具函奉達、至乞俯賜察核、照辦爲禱、（下略）</p>
<h3>最後申訴國際公裁</h3>
<p>又據金晳家屬代表陳陽、李世昌·等又語歐亞社記者、謂此次日領非法逮捕金晳、不惟有損我國主權、且實違反租界協定及國際公法、雖經我政府當局嚴重交涉、但仍置之不理、如日領猶藐視如故、金氏家屬方面、决將電訴各國聲請國際公裁、尚望我全國上下、共同力爭、以期獲最後之勝利而維持國家之威信云云、</p>
<h3>各公團將組織金會</h3>
<p>繼陳氏復對歐亞社記者云、金晳自被捕以來、計已二十七日、前途險象殊多、倘不再接再厲、向日領嚴重交涉、則金晳釋回之問題、必不可樂觀、現聞納税華人會等團體、有提議組織援金委員會、果屬事實、本家屬方面、當卽參加、並極力協助云、</p>

<p>、江浙兩省内地各縣鎭稱爲内河民信局、專送商店個人之函件寄滙銀行等、信用卓著、故營業漸臻擴充、迄今已有一百數十年之歷史、殆後國營郵政局設立後、爲實施限制民信局營、業將外河信局先增收過鎊費、初爲每鎊民信繳納郵局三角二分、繼增至六角四分、至民國二年、又改爲每鎊九角六分、本年上月間又由九角六分增至一元二角六分、外河民信受此嚴格限制後、民信事業、已無形淘汰、相繼停業、信差船夫失、業者達數千餘人、最近交通部又將内河民信局施行限制、第一步公布掛號領照營業辦法、第二步亦同様增收信件過鎊費、每鎊一元二角八分、故内河民局無利可圖、羣情異常恐慌、</p>
<h3>郵局扣留民信</h3>

<p>交通部郵政管理局昨批覆民信局云、原具呈人内河民信業代表印源通呈一件、爲瀝陳内河民信局營業實情、懇請展期過磅、並酌减郵資由呈悉、查民信局收寄郵件、照章均須封作總包、交由郵局寄遞、並按總包重量繳納郵費、已較按件黏貼郵票低廉特多、所請展期過磅及酌减郵費、應毋庸議、此批、兼代局長唐寳書、</p>

<h3>與衆不同庸子</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>最新式一、自然是够受人歡迎的。但，「復古」，也一様的受人嘖嘖讚許。「新」與「古」、本只是時代的不同，我們可不用大</p>
<p>驚小怪，目爲不合邏輯，因爲「最新式」與「復古」所含的成分中，具備着一個質量相同的分子，——「與衆不同」。</p>
<p>在一大羣穿着旗袍的太太，姑娘中，有一二位在旗袍之外，再套上一件没人穿過的外套，或披肩之類，無疑地是將被人稱許爲最新式的了。可是在這一羣中，若有一二位穿着裙兒樸兒，一様的因了行動的婀娜婷，而可以得人的羨慕。猶諸在這女子競尙剪髮的潮流中，把頭髮燙成哈叭狗兒式，是「最新式」，但有些太太們、却把已剪的青絲　　養長了梳成髮髻，也未始不别有風趣。</p>
<p>所以每天吃慣家常便飯的，偶然接得了一份紅帖兒、送了兩大元人情、去叨擾一餐魚翅海參的豐餚盛鐉，真够味。但是到了大小月底，經濟擱淺了，上老虎灶去三個燒餅、一壺開水，也會覺得燒餅之香，開水之甘。這踓然不是「最新式」與「復古」，但也是「與衆不同」的生活之一。　　近代的文學巨擘，寫出來的文章，能够嵌進幾句西方名作家的原文的，才有資格稱爲文藝界的權威者。但是會得哼絶律古風，拼四儷六的、一様的可以自尊斵輪老手’而出足風頭。惟有左逮於「新」’右不於「古」説科道白’隨俗沉浮的便只得一世的而已而而已。</p>
<p>在大都市裏’一座一九三四年式的十八層大厦行基奠　’可以引到大高貴紳士’閨閣名媛’來參加盛典。但是在同一都市裡’當十八世紀宫殿式的建築物落揭幕時也會得車水馬龍、極一時之盛。原因是「一九三四年式」與十八世紀宫殿式」’同様是「與衆不同」的。明乎此’人們便可以認識應該走的路。</p>
<h3>談稱謂</h3>
<p>— 仕庚</p>
<p>谁都知道’我們這大中華是文明古國’禮義之邦’而綱常「倫瑾」之道’尤其是我們這古國中數千來奉爲天經義的「國梓」。你看’我國對於親戚間的關係和謂’分别得多少清楚：凡讀過「尺牘」的人’想來都很知道有。至於洋鬼子’究竟是「蠻夷戎狄」之類’對於「人倫」方面’大抵不很重視。例如「伯母」’「叔母」「姑母」’「舅母」’「姨母」’英文統稱曰Ａunt’法文统稱曰Ｔante：「伯父」’「叔父」’「姑父」’「舅父」’「姨丈」’英文統稱曰Ｕncle’法文統稱曰Ｏncle：實在遠不如我們中國文字來得一目了然。</p>
<p>但中國文字中間也有許多稱謂是很含糊的。例如一個「姨」字’便有好多用法；外甥稱母親的姊妹呌做「姨母」’姊丈（或妹丈）稱妻子的姊妹呌做「内姨」’一般人稱小老婆呌「姨太太」’妓女稱鴇母呌「姨娘」’主人稱傭婦呌「娘姨」。</p>
<p>又如「兄弟姊妹」，在日常交際上差不多隨處都應用得到。儘管是兩個素昧平生的陌生人’見過了一兩次面以後’便馬士是「仁兄」。異性方面’最初當然是「先生」「女士」’但到了某種時期’可以一躍而爲「哥哥」’「妹妹」。在這「四海」之内皆兄弟也」的趨勢中。在對於自已的親兄弟。親姊妹當然要和其餘的「同胞」有一些區别’於是乎便産生了「胞兄」’「胞弟」’「胞姊」’「胞妹」的稱呼。</p>
<p>有人爲「稱謂合理化」起見。主張採用法律名詞。如「直系尊親’」「旁系尊親」’「一親等」’「二親等」等等’但恐怕這様「混而統之」的稱呼’對於我們這文明古國的民族性有些不適合吧？</p>
<h3>故鄉的野菜</h3>
<p>— 王娵女士</p>
<p>提起浙東的野菜’怕已誰都知道了吧！這緣故’是因爲周豈明先生曾在「雨天的書」裏談起過’豈明先生是蓄今的大散文家’雖是鄙野的小草’一經品題’也覺得身價十倍了。</p>
<p>野菜中’最普通的是草紫和紫雲英。</p>
<p>二者都播種田内’用作肥料’兼可食’豈明先生已曾説過’這且不在話下。但豈明先生似乎草紫也當作紫雲英一例看待’其實並不如此。現在姑就所知’談談它們的分别。</p>
<p>草紫滬語呌做草頭’花小如桂’色黄莫名的惆悵。、因名金花菜’也就是野苜蓿。葉是由三瓣倒卵形小葉所合成’莢作螺旋形’有剌。據説北方有開紫花的苜蓿’在浙東是看不見的。</p>
<p>紫雲英的葉是由多數小葉合成的。花形像蓮花’約有銅元那麽大’色紅紫’間有白者’入藥。結實成莢。就其形狀而論’和草紫顯然不同’而且也較草紫爲賤。</p>
<p>豈明先生以爲草紫通稱紫雲英’在我鄉（自然也是浙東）實際並不如此。不但草紫依舊呌做草紫’便連紫雲英也不呌紫雲英而呌片花。紫雲英三字不過是文人筆頭的點綴品’在鄉村是並不通行的　　這二種以外’還有馬蘭頭和薺菜’薺</p>
<p>菜也呌花臉菜’雖不及馬蘭頭清香’伹煑來也頗可口。它們生長在差不多的時</p>
<p>候。而且隨處都有’是農民大衆的飯菜。每當早春時節’寒冷寂寞的田野裏’常可看見鄉村的小姑娘’三五成羣’蹲在畦隴邊’採取嫩緑的野菜：伊們跳着</p>
<p>唱着’尋找着大自然爲伊們預備下的佳餙。</p>
<p>自已在幼少時候’也曾跟着去採剪過’跳跳跑跑’這種活潑的景况總不容易忘記。昨天偶然從市場裏買來些薺菜’不覺就引起對於從前的回憶’因而想到這些薺菜不知是那一個村裏那一個姑娘採取來的’心裏怪難過。吃了以後’覺得味道不及從前好’於是又加上了一層莫名的惆悵。</p>
<h3>寒宵獨白</h3>
<p>— 幸生</p>
<p>農村破産了—「到都會去」’「到都會去」。——人們都從農村或小城市集中到都會來：誰都想’這便是無憂之鄉。</p>
<p>上海：是中國第一個大都會’也是全世界上的一個特殊形態的大都會。</p>
<p>上海：在某一種社會裏是一個不夜之城’在某一種社會裏’却是個不見天日的地獄。</p>
<p>一個輝煌燦爛的軀壳’包藏着破碎頽敗的靈魂：這正是資本主義社會的特徴　　新近’明星影片公司沈西苓導演的新片「上海二十四小時」’我覺得真是上海社會一張最清晰的寫照。它告訴你上海最淫靡的生活的一面’它也告訴你上海最黑暗的生活的一面。它告訴你：上流社會的人們的心理是如何卑鄙齷齪’而下流社會的人們的精神却怎様光明磊落’富於同情心。</p>
<p>「上海二十四小時」’這一晝夜裏面。你試想像：會發生多少悲歡離合的情節’多少又驚又喜的故故’多少狗苟蠅營的活劇。</p>
<p>「上海二十四小時」’你試計算每一小時當中：勞働者要流去多少血汗’金融資本界有多少金錢流動’有閑的紳士淑女們要揮霍去多少的金錢？要是有統計的話’那是怎麽個驚人的數目—</p>
<p>國際間風雲日緊’而内亂又起’黨爭未已。在這様狂風暴雨的時代’歌台舞謝’楚館秦樓’却永遠是狂歡徹夜’一派昇平景象。「商女不知亡國恨’隔江猶唱後庭花」：想不到唐人詩句’竟爲今日醉生夢死的人羣冩照。</p>
<h3>東北四連長</h3>
<p>— 張恨水</p>
<p>第二十回　卜吉有期老人連日笑　剷愁不盡舊雨對門居</p>
<p>他説到這裏’就望丁桂枝笑道’天一天二的’我要到城裏去一趟的。這就看你的運氣’若是我賬收得多呢’我另</p>
<p>外還要打幾様首飾’還替你買一點貴重的衣料。桂枝也不置可否’只是低了頭來笑着。趙翁道：真的’我這様一大把年紀’能怎麽様’就説到怎麽様’决不騙你的。江氏就揰嘴笑道：不是老太爺疼我這丫頭。我們這兩家的親事’也許還攀結不成功呢’誰能説老太爺會騙他呀！趙翁又呵呵的笑了。談了一陣子’他看到桂枝總是羞人答答’坐在裏外房交界的所在’心裏這就想着’這又是我不體諒人了。人家大姑娘只爲難’我爲什麽老當他的面説喜事呢？人家要不知道’例真説我做上人的不正經了。他如此想着。立刻板住了面孔告辭走了。桂枝低聲笑道：你瞧’這碍着他什麽事’這老頭子整日整夜的樂着。他手扶了門框’驗靠在手上’望了門外出神。看他那笑嘻嘻的神氣’未嘗不在歡喜呢。江氏道：你要到了我們這様一大把年紀’心裏也就明白了。上了歲數的人’没有什麽可想的’作官’謀財’圖名’圖利’那都隨便’就是兒子滿堂的這個念頭’比什麽還濃。若像我守半輩子寡的人’又没兒子’兩代兩個女的’只瞧着别人家熱閙哄哄’難受只好擱在心裏啦。有了姑爺’眼前添了半個兒子’這就好像有倚靠多了。再要添個把外孫：：江氏站在他面前’正説的有滋味呢’桂枝就用手推着他母親道：説啦得啦’越説越不像話了。江氏向後退了一步’笑道：這丫頭越慣的不成様子了’倒用手來推我。桂枝撅了嘴道：誰敎你説這些個呢？我不愛啦。（二七一）</p>

<p>（子已三十二歲）馬氏心中很不快樂’向法庭提出離婚。第一審判詞：一義理的母親’與其子一日接吻兩次’是應當的’然而因爲其不知次數’常常接吻’就提出離婚’理由尙欠充足。」馬氏不服’控告於大理院’結局大理院最終的判詞：「説義理母子關係’雖然一日不知次數的’可以接吻’不過不能犯父親的怒’過去的事不必追究’今日以後’應當順從夫意’不能時時與子、接吻。一</p>

<p>自由談牛鬼蛇神  吳溪　　一個在賣汽車的洋行裏做事的朋友、有一天告訴我説’要買車子’最好還是買舊的。爲什麽呢？因爲舊車子様式雖不新’但堅實耐用’價值比新式的貴一點’東西是靠得住的。新車子’是外面光的’様式新’好看’價錢不高’但是不耐用。　　爲什麽歡喜不耐用’祇要形式上好看的車子呢？聽了這位朋友的話’我很是懷疑。他説’這要從買車子的人心理方面看。現在世界上這様的不景氣’有錢的人’經商的人’誰都没有把握説他還可以支持多久。也許八個月後就會破産’也許最近就要停業。經久耐用’是想不到的；他們所想得到的’是眼前旣可以少付出一些錢而形式又惹人注意。幾個月後’車子是否依舊屬於自已不可知’有什麽耐用可講呢？　　這様的心理’同様的是反映在電影方面。祇要稍稍回想’就可以使我們想到’除開香艷肉感的片子’牛鬼蛇神的出品’近來是從外國運來如此的多。你要看神怪、那麽就有「死光」「僵屍」等等來滿足你的慾望。你要看驚心動魄的獸片’那麽就有「匃京春夢」’「金剛」等等來給你享受。就是在牛鬼蛇神的形式之下’而含有若干意義的’如「豹姑娘」之類’大家也不會把他當理想的作品看’依舊是作爲神怪片來使自已享受的。這類片子’公然映了的’已是不少’以後’當然還會繼續的來。　　如此的心理’和買汽車是共同的’有着一致性的。新奇様式的汽車’是特别受人歡迎：牛鬼蛇神的片子’每當公映的時候’也是特别的賣座。一面是怕極了’恐怖極了’一面却不得不搶先的’甚至號召友朋們同來看。雖然看電影與買汽車是兩件事’但這一班人要求的總結’到底是要求新奇的剌激’要求刹那間的亨樂’合理與不合理’在麻木了的神經上’已經是再没有力量判斷了。　　牛鬼蛇神的片子’所以日新月異的原因’其主要的我想是在此。爲什麽走向這様的境地呢？’我不是舊心理學家’我不能解釋着是由於人類具有好奇的本能所致。這不是由於好奇的本能’而是疲乏了的神經要求着新的激剌’而是忙迫的使人透氣來的現代生活下的一種必然的刹那的新奇的享樂的要求：再向根底裏説’這完全是瘋狂了的世界在從瘋狂走向絶滅的過程中一種没落的瘋狂心理的具現。我的解釋中如此。悼朱湘先生  余文偉　　朱湘先生是新文學界頗有名氣的文學家之一。他不獨對於西洋文學’具有極深的研究’並且對於中國文學’也有相當的素養。他在清華大學讀書時’與梁實秋聞一多等’同様的名聞一時。梁聞出國後’清華大學有著名的三子’聞子沅（朱湘）子離（饒孟侃）子惠（楊子惠）’都是當時北京的詩人。徐志摩在北京晨報創辦詩刋的時候’他們都是台柱。那時朱饒都在我們所辦的適存中學敎書’除掉朝夕聚首’數年來友誼更深以外’並且我還從他們談話中得着許多文學上的知識。前年朱湘由美歸國後’我們又商請前安徽大學校長王撫五先生聘爲敎授’從此同事一堂’無論在學問上或人格上都得着不少的砥礪和鼓舞。這是我一生中所最不能忘的一年。後來安大發生風潮’乃各奔一方’竟不料一别便成永訣了—當我聽到他的死訊的一天’終日精神’爲之不安’旣悲悼他的際遇’更憐恤他的才學。他的死’可説完全是受社會的逼迫。固然’他的性情’不免孤僻’這是他的一般明友所共知：不過生活的不安’社會對他的漠視’都是他自殺的近因。他不知道現在社會’只認得金錢’只認得勢利’只認得權力’天才的詩人’貧苦的文士’那在它的眼下—朱湘先生他旣不會蠅營狗苟’又不懂得爭權奪利’所以在這黑暗社會中’只得犧牲一生了。我恐怕現刻在社會的壓迫下’度着困苦的生活’同他一様境遇的’還不知道有多少呢？　　朱湘先生之自殺’正是現代社會黑暗的反映’也正是現代社會不能尊重文人的表現。我想’不獨我們一般朋友’爲之傷感’任何智識階級的人’也都要灑一掬同情之涙的—、　　最後’我更盼望和朱湘先生同學且同是研究文學的聞一多和饒孟侃兩君’能將朱湘先生的詩文’完全蒐集起來’彚編成册’以供研究’而慰死者。母親  李輝英　　冒着端陽節邊的小雨’走完了八里路’我當真回到家裏了。　　見到母親’盡力地抱着’驗上流滿了歡快與哀傷的熱涙。　　足足有五年多没有見到她了’在夢中也都少有看見她的時候’但想念她的心情’却時時在滋長着。　　她也在兩只昏花的眼中’倘出來了幾滴熱涙。　　「英’真是你？你真回來了？」　　像有些不相信我真會回來似的。然後、擦乾了我的眼涙’鬆開我的手’驤我上炕换了被雨澆濕的衣服。　　「媽’你老了。」　我細年她’老多了’臉上滿現着皺紋’頭髮全白了。　等我換好衣服’她倚着炕沿就抱住我’傷心設説：　　「我就是想你呢’我能不老麽’夜裏常常睜着眼睛一直到天亮。」　　隨後’她轉過話頭問我説：　　「你打那兒來的？道上好走麽？」　　我就把一路情形告訴了她’告訴她從上海坐船到大連’又坐火車到吉林’又坐大車到ＸＸ屯’然後’就冒雨走了回來。　　她聽完歡喜極了’但又吃驚地問：　　聽説大連日本人檢查學生呀’你没有讓日本人查到麽？」　　我又解釋給她怎様上的岸’遇到怎様的盤詰’她不再往下問’突地攀起我的臉’狠狠地親了一口’親完又細細端詳着：　　「你比從前瘦了’臉長了一點。」「不’人長大了。」　　因爲怕並看出我的臉瘦傷心’就這麽説。其實自已瘦’何嘗不知’幾年來在外面没有一定的住宿’東西流浪’人的身體’自然不會好的。　　外面的雨’仍然下着’像在替我哭述幾年來在外面生活的隠痛似的。妹妹打着傘’摘菜回來’她長得高高的’如其不是母親替我們介紹’我真想不到就是五年前以玩皮著稱的妹妹。　　我同母親繼續談着話。　　我問母親去年鄉間紛亂的情形’她問我上海戰爭的情形’兩方全是遭到變亂的’全是落到大冬天没有被頭蓋。她們是讓一帮胡匪搶光了’我是遭訓了日本帝國主義砲火的洗劫。這’不由地我就説：　　「你們太苦了’媽。」　　「你　不是也　一麽。」母親説　様的話回答了我。　　這以後’母親問我幾年來在外面過活的狀况’我起先真覺得無從説起’並且還不能把真情都告訴她’那她一定會更傷心的。但我又不能不説’就亂七八糟地編了一大套’可是’這已經够使她不安了。不過她這幾年來’從困難的實生活中’從巨大的變動中’多多少少嘗味到了一些多角形的人生實况。也稍稍認識了一點複雜的世面’這就加强了她的勇氣’她憤憤地向我説着下面的話：　　「没有什麽’這年頭’軟的欺負硬的怕’看來真要自已起來幹幹了。」　母親是隨着歷史的車輪’轉變成一個新的階段上的人物了’這使得我更比從前尊重她’愛護她。　　我再緊緊地抱着她笑了’外面的雨點’也在諮着我們狂笑起來。納蘭成德的詩論一  陳梁　　　一　　稍稍涉獵舊籍的人’大槪是没有不知道清代詞人納蘭成德（容若）’和他的「飲水詩詞」的。但他的隨筆集「渌水亭雜識」’却很少有人提到’原刋本也不易於訪求。這一部隨筆’對於研究他詩詞的人’關係非常重大：因爲這其間’可以説’是收了他的全部的詩論。書裏一共有隨筆約三百條、前有短的自序’序文是：　　癸丑病起’披贖經史’偶有管見’　　書之别簡。或良朋蒞止’傳述異聞　　’客去輒録而藏焉。踰三四年’遂　　成卷’曰「渌水亭雜識」’以備説家　　之瀏覽云爾。　　「渌水亭雜識」雖僅一卷’所涉及的範圍是極廣的’約略的説’自政治’經濟’軍事’一直到天文’地理’歷史’風俗’名勝’人種’以至於科學’藝術（包括文學’戲劇歌舞）’佛學’禮制’神怪’裝飾’遺聞’軼事’花卉’菓木’幾於無所不談’而大部分亦談無不精。或問題的’當然也有’如説「日本之外有一面’彼人謂之東京」’在現在看來、自是可笑’但當時人對於國際間的知識’却可由此想見。這裏’根據他論韻文的一部分’加以相當的整理’成「納蘭成德的詩論」篇。（未完）兩兄弟六三  莫泊桑著李維克譯　　七　　坐在四輪馬車裏回來的時候’除關哲安’其餘的男子都假寐着。博齊汝和羅蘭每隔五分鐘便倒在他們旁邊的人的肩上’那被壓的人把肩頭一摇推去了他們。於是他們便竪直身子’停止鼾呼’睜開眼睛’咕嚕道’「天氣真好啊’」但差不多話才説完又立刻向另一方面倒去了。　　等到回到哈佛爾的時候’他們兩人竟睡得那様深沉’别人費了狠多的力量才把他們摇醒’而博齊汝甚至拒絶到哲安家裏去吃那在等着他們去吃的茶點。大家祗好讓他在他自已家裏的門口下了車。　　這青年律師今晚第一次要在他的新居睡覺了：他能够恰巧在今晚把他未婚妻不久就要來往的房子指示給她看’因此他突然感着一種狂喜’一種稍稍稍稚的狂喜。　　女僕已經走了’羅蘭媽媽説過她自已來燒水’並且自已來服事客人’因爲她不願讓僕人守夜’恐怕火燭。　　除掉她’她的兒子和工人之外’没有任何人進來過’爲的好使别人突然看見這様漂亮的房子時感到異常驚異。　　哲安請大家在進口處等着。他要去把燭和燈點燃’於是將陸太太’他的父親和他的哥哥留在黑暗中’隨後他呌道：「來呀！」把門向兩邊大開着。　　那嵌着玻璃的過道裏燃着一球吊懸的燭台’和許多盞隠藏在棕橺樹’橡樹和花裏面的五光十色的玻璃燈’　然看去簡直像是一個戲台的佈景似的。刹時間’大家有點目瞪口呆的様子·被這種富壓所驚撼的羅蘭老爹喃喃地説道：「媽的’」簡直想要拍起手來讚美了。　隨後大家走進第一個客廳’面積不大’壁上裱着泥金的綢料’椅子也是用同様的綢料做的·那大家會議室陳設狠樸質’壁和椅都用着一色淡紅色绸料’現得非常堂皇。　哲安坐在他那滿列着書籍的辦公桌前的靠椅裏’以一種莊嚴的’稍嫝做作的語調説：　　「是啦’太太’明顯的法律條文使我剛才接受了你的委託’並使我絶對相信我們現在所商議的事’不到三個月便可獲得圓滿的解决。」　　他瞧着陸醉米太太’她則望着羅蘭媽媽微笑：而羅蘭媽媽抓着她的手’緊握着。　　哲安神采奕奕’像中學生一様手舞足踏起來’呌説道：　　「嚇’你們看在這房子裏説話多麽響亮呀！這客廳是最適於辯護的。　　他開始高聲陳述起來：　　「假使單是人道’單是我們對於一切苦痛所感着的自然的好意’也可以成爲我們向諸位所」要求的赦免的原因的話’我們將訴之於你們的惻隠之心’法官先生’訴之於你們的父親之心和人之心：可是我們還有法律相助’我們現在要在你們面前提出的祗是這法律的問題：：：　　筆爾瞧着這所本來要成爲他所有的住宅’對於他弟弟這種頑皮的舉動不禁感着償慨’他覺得他確乎狠儍並且没有多少頭腦。　　羅蘭媽媽把右邊的一張門開了。　　「這是臥室’」她説。</p>

<p>談言拉  曲辰　　　做人的藝術’有「推」與「踼」’這已有前人論過。推踢之外更有所謂「拉’」去未經人道及。　　然而這一種事實正充遍了社會。　　不多幾時前’報上就曾閙過一回ＸＸ公司强拉罷工工人上工的事。而一般夜行朋友’走在馬路上’一個不小心’也有被野雞拉去的機會。看目前的形勢’這個「拉」的運動’似乎更將活躍’更將擴展開去。　　至於「拉」的意義呢？那就是江湖上賣技朋友所説的：「幫幫塲子。」　　原來一切把戲’不論「雙脚」「獨脚」’都少不了幫塲子的。　　我們常在廣塲上看到江湖賣技的朋友’赤着膊’打了「趟拳’或是變了一套戲法’於是拱拱手向站在旁邊的觀衆説上一大遍「在家靠父母’出外靠朋友」一類的話’結論總是這一句：「請諸位幫幫塲子’不要走。」果真有幾個不走的呢’接下去他就再打拳’要變把戲起來了。　　我們又嘗進戲館’每逢名伶登塲’台下彩聲大作’人是坐得擠擠的’於是所謂「名伶」也者’也演得更起勁’唱的更響亮’於是「好戲」演成’名伶也出了名。這都是「幫場子」者的功效。否則光桿子賸名伶一個人在台上自拉目唱’自演自家看’那末這「好戲」包管是演不出的’正如變把戲的不願在寂無一人的廣場上大變其把戲一様。　　但「幫場子」的不一定是「心悦誠服」的願幫場子’這其間或者還夾雜一點其他的要求’如本來無事’借此消遣’或是想吃名伶的一頓酒菜也未可知。　　故單從字面講’「拉」的意義’頗有「親善」之意’與「推」「踢」等顯有野蠻之風不同。其實骨子裏也不無含有一點勉强’用中國舊話説起來’就是不十分「王道」。「拉伕」「拉上工」等的與推踢同屬「覇道」’且不去説他’單舉「食色性也」的一例’譬如走在馬路上的朋友’見了妓女’並不能像如魚得水’如雀歸林的去追隨她’而必須由她來「拉」’顯見横互在各人胸中的還是二付孤立的心’故即使一拉成功’而春風一度’到得天明時還是勞燕分飛。這在觀劇與看變把戲時也有同様之感。等到好戲一演完’把戲也變好的時候’所謂「幫場子」的朋友’就走的走’散的散’廣場還是一片廣場’空臺仍舊是一隻空臺而已！想再熱閙起來時’那就得再拉。　　每個人都會演他的好戲’每個人都得要「幫場子」的人’於是你拉我的拉下去’就變成一個極熱閙的世界了。幽默與沉默  劍仁　　德哥派拉據説頗以「幽默」見稱’譽之者或竟比之蕭伯訥。德氏到上海是上月二十九日’法文協會邀過茶話會歡迎過他。當日茶座上德氏確曾流露出他的「天才」：不過’他到底不是蕭’他不能引人注意’大家對這位貴客不能不是淡淡然的’但是’也没閙出亂子’　　後來聽説這位小説家到了南京’遊了許多名勝’吃過行政院’鐵部特備的華宴’看過不少南國名援’以後’就説他到北平去了。　　以不談政治’避涉蘇聯’反對共産’專講女人’工吃喝的這位名作者’應該到處受到歡迎’嘗到中國酒菜的罷！不想’在北平却遇到了「女界智識份子」的反對’以德氏幽默中的中國女子’不是真正的今日中國女青年’實含侮辱’聞擬對德氏下一警告云。還有一位所浪漫作家潘君英女士’發表了一篇堂哉的話談’在替中國女士們伸冤。可見’在這年頭兒’然是只談女人喫喝’也是會遇到人家的抗議的’幽默到底還比沉默要危險’要想真的使人歡喜’你還是做啞子的好！想來’這是非德氏意料所及的罷！？　　話説回來’德氏這回的罪狀是因德氏説過：「余對中國的特殊感想’就是</p>
<p>中國的摩登女子’美不可言’穿的衣服如同裹在身體上’臉是平平的。「據説「其實法國女子穿的衣服亦是裹在身上’何以獨譏諷中國女子。中國女子素尙禮義’不能供不知禮義之人信口雌黄。」</p>
<p>其罪」。　　「余理想的目的人’是幽默而富有</p>

<p>史實。過去的融化外來影響的努力已經完全了’但新的外來的力量又重復君臨於中國的建築界之上。西洋風的建築系統現方征服了全世界’中國的建築界應該步着先民後塵’以傳統的特長點爲主體’思所以融化這勢力日益强大的外來的侵襲’這在目前的中國建築界確是主要的新任務之一。建造園林事業之未來觀（下）  孟暉　　（二）田園都市　　田園都市’權興於英人之間’最初’公司爲都市職工而設立宿舍者’爲其起因。如道路’溝渠’建築空地’庭之植栽等’均樹一定之方針’以發揮　市之美。　　田園都市’本由一公司經營’更進</p>

<h3>Imminent War Clouds in Northern Fujian</h3>
<p>Patrol Contact Has Been Ongoing; Formal War Imminent; Red Bandits Attempting to Attack Keng-tei; 19th Route Army Moves Northward</p>
<p>(Hangzhou) Confirmed news: Patrol skirmishes in northern Fujian have been ongoing; formal war is imminent (18th dispatch). (Hangzhou) The Air Navigation Bureau dispatched planes to scout northern Fujian on the morning of the 18th. Upon returning in the evening, they reported that several thousand rebel troops in Gutian were moving northward toward Songxi. Approximately three to four thousand rebel troops in Songxi and Zhenghe are concentrating toward Shouning, showing signs of advancing. (18th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hangzhou) According to a telegram from Taishun to the Zhejiang Provincial Security Office, Keng-tei reports that over a thousand Red bandits have arrived at Guantianchang. The villages of Toufoji have been looted and there are attempts to attack Keng-tei. It is also reported that the Red bandits in Shouning are rampant. Yu Jishi has telegraphed orders to strengthen defenses. (18th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hangzhou) Yu Jishi received a telegram from Liu Heding today stating that there has been contact between front-line patrols. As they have not received a formal order for suppression, they have not launched a forceful attack. The vanguard of the Fujian rebels is composed of Red bandits with inadequate equipment and no combat capability, and can easily be wiped out. (18th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hangzhou) The person in charge of the Zhejiang Provincial Security Office stated that the Fujian Provincial Security forces are concentrating from Zhenghe and Songxi toward Shouning. Red bandits in Shou territory are attempting to break through to Keng-tei and Xixi. These two locations are 20 li from Shouning, and 90 and 40 li from the Zhejiang border towns of Yuantai and Taishun, respectively. (18th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hangzhou) According to sources close to government officials, reports of formal contact on the front lines in northern Fujian are not true. However, the outposts are on high alert and are very close to the rebel forces. Occasional clashes between patrols are unavoidable. (Central News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) An official said that Chen, Li, and others in Fujian are indeed using orders from the "puppet government" to attack the Zhejiang border. However, the Central Government has established strong defenses on the Zhejiang border. If the enemy advances, they will be met with a severe blow. Even if there is a possibility of contact, the Central Government will not issue an order for suppression. There are other methods to eliminate the rebellion invisibly in the near future, without resorting to large-scale attacks. (18th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanchang) Intelligence reports that the puppet Fujian Military Commission has appointed Zhu De as the commander-in-chief of the Second Front Army. Military affairs in northern Fujian are managed by Deng Shizeng. If necessary, Chiang Kai-shek and Cai Tingkai will personally go there. Fujian's air defense covers the eastern routes of Chuanshi, Mawei, and Changmen; the southern routes of Putian and Quanzhou; the western routes of Shuikou and Yanping; and the northern routes of Sandu and Shouning. (18th dispatch)</p>
<p>Cai Tingkai Returns to the Province from Longyan</p>
<p>(Fuzhou) Headquarters reports that Cai Tingkai returned to the province after going from Zhangzhou to Longyan. (17th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Xiamen) Former Governor of Guangxi, Wang Xianggu, as a representative for Li and Bai, arrived at Zhangzhou. It is said that Cai will accompany Wang to the province within a few days. (18th dispatch)</p>
<p>Fujian Authorities Inspect Ship Regulations</p>
<p>(Fuzhou) The Provincial Public Security Bureau has announced regulations for inspecting passenger ships along the river. Those with export permits will be released upon verification. However, each person is not allowed to carry more than 100 yuan in cash. Imports will be thoroughly inspected. The bureau will conduct a new census and implement the "joint responsibility system" at the same time. (17th dispatch)</p>
<p>Fujian Province Expedites the Construction of the Fuzhou-Yanping Highway</p>
<p>(Fuzhou) The puppet provincial government has ordered the Provincial Highway Bureau to expedite the construction of the Fuzhou-Yanping Highway. (17th dispatch)</p>
<p>Xu Youchao Will Return to the Philippines</p>
<p>(Xiamen) Xu Youchao has decided to decline the position of Governor of Longyan and will return to the Philippines by ship. (18th dispatch)</p>
<p>Headquarters of the Garrison in Zhangzhou Dissolved</p>
<p>(Xiamen) The headquarters of the 19th Route Army garrison in Zhangzhou has been dissolved and replaced by a garrison office, with Xie Dongshan as the director. (18th dispatch)</p>
<p>Zeng Yangfu Returns to Hangzhou from Jiangshan</p>
<p>(Hangzhou) Zeng Yangfu, the Director of Construction, returned to Hangzhou from Jiangshan on the morning of the 18th. (18th dispatch)</p>
<p>The Jiangpu Highway is Completely Finished</p>
<p>(Hangzhou) According to Engineer Li of the Highway Bureau, the highway from Jiangshan to Pucheng has now been completed and is scheduled to officially open to traffic at the end of this month. Construction on the section from Pucheng to Jian'ou is scheduled to begin within days. (18th dispatch)</p>

<p>Nanning: Zhang Ji, Ma Chaojun, Chen Zhaoying, and Wang Luyi left Guixian at 7:30 AM on the 17th, stopped briefly in Binyang after 10:00 AM, and arrived in Nanning at 2:00 PM. Li Zongren, Bai Chongxi, Huang Xuchu, Ye Qi, and members of the provincial government including Lei Peihong, Wang Gongdu, Su Zimei, and Sun Shaoyuan welcomed them at the station. They went to headquarters for tea. Li and Bai gave a brief report on Guangxi's construction projects and the implementation of self-government and militia training, inviting Zhang and others to visit Guilin and Liuzhou. Zhang expressed admiration. Afterwards, they went to the Yiyuan on Zhongshan Road to rest. In the afternoon, Li and others took the four representatives to the provincial party headquarters for talks lasting nearly two hours. Li and Bai both expressed concern about national affairs, hoping that the central government could quickly determine a method. They were in agreement on the need for unity to save the nation. A banquet was held at headquarters at 6:00 PM, where they continued to exchange views. Zhang, Ma, and others are scheduled to leave Guangxi on the 19th. (18th New Voice Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>Nanning: The headquarters hosted a banquet for the four representatives on the evening of the 17th, with provincial committee members in attendance. The atmosphere was convivial. Bai Chongxi spoke on his views on the current situation, focusing on the eight words: "resist Japan, suppress the communists, be friendly with neighbors." Li Zongren spoke on the urgent need for unity and hoped that the central government would take responsibility and quickly determine a method. The southwest committee members have not yet met and have not exchanged any specific ideas. It is undecided whether they will go to Beijing to attend the plenary session. (18th New Voice Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Zhang Ji and others are scheduled to leave Nanning for Guangdong on the 19th and return north to Zoulu via Hong Kong. Zou Lu will return to the province on the 19th. (18th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Political News: Since the Fujian Incident, the nation has been paying close attention to Hu Hanmin's attitude. To thoroughly express his views on the current situation, he issued a declaration on the 15th, absolutely opposing the rebellion of the Fujian province against the Kuomintang, and proposing eight measures to resolve the current political situation. The full text of this declaration was telegraphed to Beijing the day before yesterday. The Central Government believes that the eight measures proposed by Hu are indeed essential for consolidating the foundation of the party and the country and saving the critical situation, and is showing support. However, they are studying concrete ways to implement them and do not wish to reply for now. Once there is a result, they will telegraph Zhang Ji, Ma Chaojun, and others to convey it to Hu. In addition, because the Kuomintang is a council system, the eight measures proposed by Hu, no matter how pertinent and feasible or how good a plan to save the nation, must go through the council procedures legally and under party rules. It is planned to invite Hu to attend the Fourth Plenary Session to explain the proposal, so that it can be passed and implemented. As it stands now, it is just the opinion of an individual member of the Central Committee. This has been telegraphed to Zhang Ji and others to convey to the southwest committees. (18th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) An official said that the Central Government has not yet presented Hu Zhantang's declaration on the current situation issued in Hong Kong for discussion. Because Hu's declaration takes consolidating the party and the country as its position and is a good strategy for saving the critical situation, the Central Government will likely agree with it. Rumors that Sun Ke, the President of the Legislative Yuan, will go south again are not true. After the four representatives of the Central Government arrived in Guangdong, all measures were thoroughly explained. The Southwest committees should be able to fully understand. In recent days, the peaceful atmosphere between the Southwest and the Central Government seems very strong. (18th dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese and Puppet Troops</h3>
<p>More Than Ten Li from Chicheng; No Conflict with Liu's Troops Yet; Japanese Planes Scout Guyuan and Other Places; The Ping Authorities Decide to Negotiate with Japan and Order Troops Stationed in Chahar to Defend Their Original Locations</p>
<p>(Beiping) Zhangjiakou telegram: Liu Guitang's representative visited Song Qin at 10:00 AM on the morning of the 18th to report on the situation at the front. Japanese and puppet troops are now only ten li from Chicheng, where Liu's troops are stationed. There has been no conflict yet. Japanese and puppet troops in Guguan, Heihe County are beginning to withdraw. A small number of Japanese and puppet troops remain stationed at Xifengkou. He is requesting instructions on where to move the defenses and how to respond. The Japanese and puppet troops used the pretext of suppressing bandits to advance and have now withdrawn. The are concentrating toward Dolon. (18th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Song Zheyuan telegraphed He Yingqin tonight stating that over a thousand Japanese and puppet troops that invaded eastern Chahar are still in the area of Xifengzhai and Hongshicha, without any movement. The Japanese and puppet troops in the rear have also not advanced. (18th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Over a thousand Japanese and puppet troops that invaded eastern Chahar are still in the area of Dagugezhen, Hongshicha, and Xifengzhai, without any movement. Yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, two Japanese planes flew from Chengde to the area of Guyuan, Dushikou, and Shitouchengzi to scout for a while before flying back. (18th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Regarding the incident of the Japanese and puppet troops invading eastern Chahar, the authorities have decided to negotiate with Japan through diplomatic channels, and have ordered the troops stationed in Chahar Province to defend their original locations and maintain local security. (18th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The actions of the Japanese army in southeastern Chahar are more akin to demarcating the border between Rehe and Chahar than suppressing bandits. Officials here in Japan said that a certain village within "Manchukuo" had three hundred soldiers. The Japanese side believes that these are miscellaneous troops who will endanger the peace of the border, so they sent troops to suppress them. Now that the work of the Kwantung Army is complete, the main force of the Japanese-Manchu army has already withdrawn, leaving a small part to protect the border. Japan has absolutely no intention of crossing this border. This matter can now be considered closed. (18th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>The Chahar Authorities Adopt a Calm Approach</p>
<p>(Beiping) As of the evening of the 17th, the puppet troops in eastern Chahar are still stationed outside Xifengzhai, with no signs of advancing or moving. The number of troops is confirmed to be over a thousand, carrying two light steel cannons and several machine guns. Song Zheyuan is taking a calm approach to this matter. On the one hand, he ordered the troops stationed in eastern Chahar to monitor the actions of the Japanese and puppet troops. On the other hand, he sent a senior official to the front to investigate the truth, so that he can report it to the authorities for negotiations. A senior official in Peiping has sent a staff to contact the Japanese side and ask the Japanese and puppet troops to withdraw as soon as possible, so as not to cause other misunderstandings. The government said that it is a local issue and is waiting for the Chahar authorities to report on the handling of the situation and the truth before negotiating with the Japanese side. As of the 18th, they are still taking a calm approach. (18th Central News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Song Zheyuan telegraphed Beijing stating that four to five thousand Japanese and puppet troops and five or six airplanes, under the pretext of suppressing bandits, suddenly moved toward Guyuan and Ningfeng in eastern Chahar. An official said that there was indeed a small contact east of Guyuan, but the situation is not serious. The Peiping Political Council is negotiating with the Japanese side for their withdrawal. The claim of suppressing bandits is purely fabricated, as there are no bandits in that area. There are only the troops of Liu Guitang. The Japanese side is likely using this as a pretext to advance troops. (18th dispatch)</p>
<p>Song Zheyuan Appointed Commander of Bandit Suppression</p>
<p>(Beiping) He Yingqin has appointed Song Zheyuan as the commander of bandit suppression in Chahar Province. The personnel of his headquarters will be concurrently filled by the personnel of the 29th Army headquarters, without a separate budget. (18th dispatch)</p>

<p>(Beiping) Qin Decheng, Liu Ruming, and Zhang Zizhong arrived in Zhangjiakou last night and talked with Song Zheyuan for a long time, reporting on their visit to He to ask for instructions. Xiao Zhenying, Guo Zhihan, and others were also present. It was decided to telegraph the Peiping authorities to quickly negotiate with the Japanese side for the withdrawal of the Japanese and puppet troops from eastern Chahar, and to order the troops stationed in eastern Chahar to move to the area of Dushikou, Chicheng, and Longmensuo to monitor the actions of the puppet troops, so as to avoid misunderstandings. According to official news, the Japanese side stated that the purpose of this invasion of eastern Chahar by the Japanese and puppet troops was to suppress bandits on the border between Rehe and Chahar, and they would withdraw to Chengde soon. According to sources close to the Japanese side, the total number of Japanese and puppet troops entering eastern Chahar this time is no more than a thousand, carrying two machine cannons and dozens of machine guns. It is hoped that the Japanese side will take into account its own reputation and avoid escalating the situation. The mission is paying close attention to the eastern Chahar incident and plans to form an inspection team to inspect the border of Chahar if necessary. (18th dispatch)</p>
<p>Beijing Has Not Yet Received Confirmation</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Recently, the Japanese military used the pretext of suppressing bandits to send troops to scout the east, resulting in conflict with our stationed troops of Liu, Ma, and others. Beijing has not yet received confirmation. If Japan violates the Tanggu Truce and disturbs eastern Chahar, the Peiping Political Council will be ordered to negotiate nearby. (18th Central News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) An official said that the Central Government has not received a report on the sudden occupation of eastern Chahar by Japanese and puppet troops. It is difficult to guess the purpose. Telegrams have been sent to the chief officers stationed in Peiping to inquire about the details, so as to provide guidance. (18th dispatch)</p>

<h3>Chen Jitang's Car Trip Encountered Danger</h3>
<p>Police Squad Opened Fire Due to Misunderstanding; Chen Suffered Minor Injuries; He Is Resting in Zengcheng</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Chen Jitang and his wife took a car trip to Luogang Cave on the morning of the 17th. As they drove to the Kantou area, they were shot at by the Panyu police squad. Chen's car sped away to escape, but the car's vibrations caused a minor injury to Chen's mouth. The reason for the incident was that the area near Longyandong and Lianhexu had a tradition of robbing new grooms. The police squad mistook the car for kidnappers and set up an ambush to intercept them. Chen's car happened to pass by, leading to the misunderstanding. At the same time, Du Meihe and Wang Lesheng, employees of the Provincial Bank, and a prostitute, Hua Yunxian, were also shot and wounded while traveling in a car. Hua died shortly after. After the incident, Chen Jitang sent multiple armored vehicles to Lianhexu to investigate and strictly prohibit such customs. Traffic in the area near the village was temporarily cut off. Furthermore, when Chen Jitang encountered danger, his bodyguards returned fire, but most of them were scattered. When Chen Jitang arrived in Zengcheng, he only had one guard left. Chen Jitang immediately called Miao Peinan and ordered him to send troops to the scene to investigate. As of the afternoon of the 18th, Chen Jitang was still in Zengcheng and had not returned to the province. (18th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Guangzhou) Two shooting incidents occurred in the suburbs of Guangzhou this afternoon. The first incident involved Chen Jitang's guards. It is said that after Chen inspected Fengzhen, he was returning to the province by car when the local militia, due to a misunderstanding, fired into the air and ordered the car to stop. Chen's guards then responded with handguns, but fortunately no one was injured. Chen arrived safely in the province. The second incident occurred on the avenue leading to Maojiadun. A car sped by, and the military police mistook the passengers for bandits and opened fire. A young woman was walking on the road and was killed by a stray bullet. Two others were seriously injured, including Du, the chief auditor of the Guangdong Provincial Bank. (18th Reuters dispatch)</p>

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>The Evolution of Franco-German Relations and the Intensification of the World Economic Panic</h3>
<p>By - British</p>
<p>Since Italy proposed a fundamental restructuring of the League of Nations, European diplomats have been scurrying around, engaging in secret negotiations, rushing back and forth, and shuttling to and fro. One suddenly feels that the barriers of the European situation are especially stark. The division of the continental countries has been long-standing and is even more intense today. One side adheres to the principle of maintaining the status quo, while the other benefits from breaking it. The former includes France, Belgium, Czechoslovakia, and other countries, while the latter includes Germany, Italy, and other countries. Only Britain advances and retreats, changes with the times, and weighs the relative importance of the two sides. Its key lies in how the confrontational relationship between the two strong nations of France and Germany develops.</p>
<p>The Franco-German dispute has become increasingly dangerous since Germany withdrew from the League of Nations. Last month, Germany made the following three major demands to France: (1) that it be allowed to have a military force of 300,000 men; (2) that it be allowed to possess the weapons that other countries possess; and (3) that the Saar region be returned without waiting for the plebiscite to be held in 1935. Furthermore, Italy, with its Italian-style multifaceted diplomacy, attempted to achieve Russo-Italian amity, German-Russian compromise, restructure the League of Nations, and separate Britain and France. Thus, the Franco-German opposition became even more acute.</p>
<p>France's position has been clear from beginning to end. Its sole intention is to form a line of encirclement against Germany, especially by uniting Central European countries into a large anti-German group as its foundation. Distant connections such as the Little Entente and recent developments such as the Franco-Russian non-aggression treaty are all substitutes for Britain and Italy gradually drifting apart. Since Germany and Italy have colluded, France's relationship with the sympathetic countries of the Middle East has become even closer. For example, the meeting between the foreign ministers of Romania and Czechoslovakia in Gastchu confirmed the inviolability of the League of Nations. The recent meeting between the foreign ministers of France and Czechoslovakia in Paris was even broader in scope. In summary, there are four main points: (1) France will not engage in individual talks; (2) Germany must not restore its military; (3) The disarmament conference must not be held outside of Geneva; (4) Amendments to the covenant require a unanimous decision. The intention is very clear. Furthermore, it is said that French Foreign Minister Pang Ku will soon travel to the Czech Republic, Romania, Poland, and even Moscow, the capital of Russia, is a planned destination. Thus, its plan to encircle Germany is even more obvious, although it seeks to slow down the Franco-Russian relationship to temporarily conceal traces. It is impossible to do so.</p>
<p>The Franco-German confrontational relationship has reached such a tense level, and its fundamental source is the struggle between France and Germany for the dominant leadership in Europe, which is also a natural consequence of the deepening world economic panic. As the capitalist system in various countries develops to this day, the panic of overproduction becomes more severe, and the struggle for market division becomes more intense. The struggle between France and Germany stirs and clashes, forming a dark cloud over the European political situation, presenting an ominous storm. Is there any other reason? It is merely a reflection of a corner of the world economic panic. At this time, what is most worthy of the world's great attention is that the more turbulent the European political situation, the more important the Soviet Union's diplomatic position becomes. France has long established a considerable relationship with Russia. Italy has also recently sought to approach Russia. The German-Russian relationship was once reconciled, but ultimately failed. This is something that France can feel somewhat reassured about. Recently, the French aviation minister, Kong Te, said in his discussion of Japanese-Soviet relations that the Soviet Union's air force strength is enough to make Araki hesitate and worry. The meaning is that the reason why the Soviet Union has the power to subdue neighboring countries and influence the situation is simply due to the success of its air force construction. Therefore, the importance of the Soviet Union's position has been valued by all countries and is unimaginable.</p>
<h3>Wang Jingwei's Report at the National Government Memorial Week: The Premier's Teachings are the Only Way to Survive</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) President Wang reported at the National Government Memorial Week on the 18th, briefly stating that he was ordered by the Chairman to report on the political work of the past week. The government's policy is to eliminate the communist bandits as a short-term solution and to promote production and construction as a long-term solution. Now, at a time when internal and external troubles are pressing, we are striving forward in accordance with this policy. Suddenly, the likes of Chen and Li rebelled in Fujian. The government's policy will certainly not be affected by the rebellion of Chen and Li, and there will be no wavering. However, it is inevitable that it will be hindered in various ways and unable to proceed vigorously, which is very painful. Chen, Li, and others want to overthrow the central government, willingly uniting with the communist bandits. To unite with the communist bandits, they are willing to abandon the Kuomintang and reject the Republic of China. They say that hanging the Premier's portrait and reading the will is a religious ritual. However, when we gather comrades today with the same faith, the same purpose, and the same actions, and respectfully read the Premier's will before the Premier's portrait, it is by no means comparable to a religious ritual. The Spring and Autumn Annals state that King Fuchai of Wu wanted to avenge the Yue king's killing of his father, so he had people ask "Has Fuchai forgotten the Yue king's killing of his father?" whenever he entered or left the court. The answer was, "I dare not forget." This went on for three years. It seems extremely complicated, but it is not complicated at all. Fuchai never forgot to avenge his father, so he thought this way in his heart, he had to hear this with his ears, he had to see this with his eyes, he had to say this with his mouth, and he would definitely be able to do this in his actions. Only with this purpose and determination could he constantly remind himself to pay attention. Although he heard this sentence every time he went to court, he did not feel it was complicated within three years, and he was finally able to avenge his father within three years. Once the father's revenge was avenged, this kind of questioning was eliminated. Then Xi Shi came, and all the habits of extravagance and debauchery were adopted. The spirit of striving for good governance completely disappeared. The Yue king, with ten years of accumulation and training, finally caused Fuchai to follow his father to his demise. Today, from the time the Premier died until now, although the unification of China has been superficially completed, how much of the realization of doctrines and policies has there been? The so-called unification can only be said to be the unification of China in the name of the party, and by no means the unification of China by the party's doctrines. Reading the Premier's will respectfully for only one day a week and silently recalling the Premier's struggles for China during his lifetime are far less effective than what King Fuchai of Wu did. At that time, he constantly reminded himself. Even holding two or three meetings and respectfully reading the Premier's will each time is far less effective than what Fuchai did that day. Fuchai was only concerned with the revenge of his father's death, which was engraved in his mind and he dared not forget it, and yet he was like that. How should we, who bear a major historical mission, bear the major task of completing the national revolution, and bear the major responsibility of seeking freedom and equality for the Chinese nation, be? Therefore, holding memorial weeks and respectfully reading the will is not so much a religious ritual as it is based on revolutionary determination, based on revolutionary personality, and not forgetting revolutionary goals, and sincerely practicing it. We feel the pressure of internal and external troubles, we feel that the communist bandits have not been quelled, and Chen, Li, and others have once again instigated chaos in Fujian. Every time we meet, every time we have a memorial week, and every time we respectfully read the Premier's will, we feel even more the necessity of implementing the Premier's teachings, and we feel even more the courage to strive forward with these teachings. The above only addresses Chen, Li, and others' attacks on the respectful reading of the will as a religious ritual. In fact, it is not even a matter of ritual. They have fundamentally abandoned the doctrine long ago. Those who defend them say that they want to implement a land policy, and You Ren even exaggerates it, saying that they want to implement "implementing a land policy," which is naturally a very inflammatory slogan.</p>
<p>However, what we should pay attention to is not a beautiful and empty slogan, but the content contained in the slogan regarding the actual situation of the present society and the results it causes. The earliest advocate of the land policy was none other than the Premier. No one observed the social and economic situation more thoroughly than the Premier. In the Principle of People's Livelihood, the Premier's advocacy of land to the tiller is extremely clear and detailed. From the Premier's teachings, we know that the Premier adopted revolutionary means for political propositions, and peaceful methods and gradual steps for economic issues. Because the Premier saw through the current social and economic situation in China, the conditions for economic transformation were not yet in place. If it is done too hastily or too radically, it will only shake it and hasten its collapse. Only by using peaceful methods and gradual steps to make all the conditions available can social and economic problems be solved one by one, and only then can society evolve from the old economic system to the new economic system. Politics is a sudden change, and economics is a gradual process. This is a principle that no social scientist can deny. If it is forcibly implemented by swallowing it whole, it will only hasten the total collapse of the entire society. This kind of painful experience has been clearly demonstrated in the two lakes in the past sixteen years and in Jiangxi in the seventeen years since. The Communist Party advocated its so-called land policy in the two lakes by means of swallowing it whole. The result was murder, arson, and social unrest, which made the comrades in Wuhan determined to split with the Communist Party. The Communist Party implemented its so-called land policy in Jiangxi by means of swallowing it whole. The result was a land of red and the people living in misery, which made the comrades who bear military and political responsibility today do their best to curb the communists. Those who advocated purging the party in Nanjing in the morning have now forgotten the past and united with the communists. Those who suffered pain in Wuhan and were determined to split with the communists have now willingly abandoned themselves and recognized the thieves as friends. Those who went deep into the bandit areas and personally experienced it are now willing to turn Fujian into a bandit area for personal gain.</p>
<p>Looking back on the past, I cannot help but feel sorrow. Why does the Communist Party's practice of forcibly implementing the land policy by swallowing it whole only hasten the total collapse of the entire society? Because its implementation must involve slaughter. Initially, it incites poor farmers to slaughter in order to seize land from landlords. Then, it drives poor farmers to compete for land and slaughter each other. They borrow the French and Russian Revolutions as a defense. However, during the French and Russian Revolutions, although there are no precise statistics on the number of victims, according to the History of the Great Revolution written by Kropotkin, from the establishment of the Revolutionary Tribunal on October 17, 1793, to June 11, 1794, 2,607 people were killed in fourteen months. From June 11, 1794, to July 27 of the same year, only 151 people were executed by the same tribunal in just one month and sixteen days. The most noteworthy thing is that only one-seventh of those killed had titles and property, and the rest were poor people. The Russian Revolution was also largely the same. The concentration of land in China today is far from what it was in France and Russia at that time, and there are no nobles and landlords like in France and Russia. In France and Russia at that time, a very small number of nobles occupied a huge amount of land, and in addition to exploiting the labor of farmers to support one person, they only engaged in hunting and debauchery. Today, there are very few real large landlords in China. The vast majority are small and medium-sized landlords. Small and medium-sized landlords are everywhere, and their number is thousands of times greater than that of the French and Russian nobles. In addition to owning land, small and medium-sized landlords also engage in industry, commerce, or other social occupations. Therefore, when the Communist Party incites poor farmers to seize land and slaughter small and medium-sized landlords, the number of people killed is thousands of times greater than during the French and Russian Revolutions, and the degree of terror is thousands of times more cruel than in France and Russia. After the small and medium-sized landlords are killed, the only small-scale industry and commerce in society are destroyed, and the entire social economy collapses. Poor farmers seize land, but the land has become a wasteland and cannot be cultivated, which means they have no way to make a living. They then follow them and engage in murder and arson, which is exactly one way to "force them to Liangshan." Is it effective? It depends on the early and late stages. In the early stage, due to temporary excitement, a small number of poor people are incited to rebel with the Communist Party. In the late stage, after the social economy is collapsed, industry and commerce decline, and cultivation cannot be started. In order to seize land, they plot to overthrow the landlords and carry out large-scale slaughter. Now, they have no choice but to slaughter each other. During the Wuhan period, the Communist Party decided in Puqi that anyone with more than fifty yuan in property was a petty bourgeois. Originally, "bourgeoisie" and "petty bourgeoisie" were formed when social classes were differentiated to a considerable extent. In Europe and the United States, class differentiation is obvious, and each class has a certain meaning in society. The degree of class differentiation in Chinese society is different from that in Europe and the United States. The Communist Party uses this term in China, and can only arbitrarily set its standards. Since more than fifty yuan is defined as a petty bourgeois and is subject to being overthrown, then a耕牛 is worth more than fifty yuan. The 耕民 are extremely poor, and at least they have a 耕牛. Therefore, the farmers themselves are subject to being overthrown. No wonder more than six million people have been slaughtered in Jiangxi today. The evil content and tragic consequences of implementing the land policy can be seen. It is pitiful that the so-called proletarian literary publications still say that this kind of murder and arson policy is implemented for the benefit of the people and can win the support of the people. Some people even think that the slaughter in the two lakes and the slaughter in Jiangxi are not enough and want to promote it in Fujian and promote it in China. There is nothing more outrageous than this. Only traitors who disregard the destruction of the country and the extermination of the race would do this. The Communist Party's propaganda of the land policy in the late stage is purely the face of Zhang Xianzhong and Li Zicheng. Their murder and arson are the inevitable results of the method of swallowing it whole. The policy that the Communist Party, quasi-Communist Party, and even the tools of the Communist Party promote is</p>
<p>the same as the way imperialists deceive colonies: it is a poison with a sugar-coated surface and a bitter heart. We must never allow a fragmented China to collapse again, and we must never allow poisonous snakes and ferocious beasts to remain in the world for a day. We must not let the world know the evil content and tragic consequences of the land policy promoted by the Communist Party, the quasi-Communist Party, and the tools of the Communist Party. The destruction of the Communist Party is not enough to shake our fundamental beliefs, and the rebellion of the quasi-Communist Party and the tools of the Communist Party is not enough to disturb our hearts. The deeper the internal troubles and the more severe the external troubles, the more we feel that our responsibility is great, and the more we feel that the Premier's teachings are the only way to survive today. Only by working hard with a unified determination, taking unified steps, and marching towards a common goal, eliminating the communist bandits as a short-term solution, and promoting production and construction as a long-term solution, can we open up a path of equality and freedom for the Chinese nation.

<h3>Central Party Headquarters Memorial Week Report: Fang Juehui...Reviving the Nation and the Race</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central Government held the 109th</p>
<p>Memorial Week at 9:00 a.m. on the 18th. About 500 people, including Ye Chucang, Ju Zheng, Fang Juehui, Ji Liang, Wang Qi, Li Zonghuang, Li Ciwen, Dai Kuisheng, and staff, attended. Ye Chucang presided over the meeting, and Fang Juehui reported, briefly stating that at this time of internal and external troubles, we should all bear the responsibility of reviving the nation and the race, and should not be depressed or slack. We should follow the path of national salvation and strive together. After the European War, the spirit of Germany's revival and the spirit of nation-building in Italy, Turkey, and Poland are all our examples. Since the September 18th Incident, the national crisis has become increasingly serious. The reasons for this are that, on the surface, there are disturbances from communist bandits and rebels. However, the influx of foreign goods, the stagnation of agricultural products, and the bankruptcy of rural villages are the greatest hidden dangers. All of these can endanger the country and should not be ignored. The Premier has clearly indicated the strategy of saving the country and building the country in his teachings. We can only follow this strategy to cultivate national strength, revive China, eliminate selfish and self-interested mentality, and not be depressed or decadent, let alone engage in empty talk. We should embrace the spirit of struggle and sacrifice and overcome all difficulties. (Central News Agency telegram on the 18th)</p>
<h3>Chen Weishan Cables that Dita and Other Cities are Peaceful: Muslims Support Sheng Shicai</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Chen Weishan, the administrative officer of Tacheng, Xinjiang,</p>
<p>cabled the Beijing Office of Xinjiang Province from Baketu, Soviet Union, saying that Ma bandit He Ying led thousands of people from Afanta a month ago, and the situation was very rampant. Fortunately, reinforcements arrived and the siege of Tacheng was lifted. The bandits fled to Suilai and were wiped out by the provincial army. At present, Dita is safe and Asan and Yili are all right. (Special telegram on the 18th)</p>
<p>Baketu received news from Tacheng that the military and civilians there</p>
<p>were firmly working to support the Dihua government and eliminate the rebellion of Zhang Bohuang (transliteration), the superintendent of Ningyuan. The Hui people, who account for the largest majority of the population of Xinjiang Province, have sent representatives to Dihua to declare to Superintendent Sheng Shicai that they are willing to defeat Zhang's troops and the Hui army led by Ma Zhongying. Kaji Niye, the leader of the Hui people, declared that he would send troops to Ningyuan. (Tas News Agency telegram on the 17th)</p>
<h3>Mongolian Autonomy Plan: To Be Submitted for Discussion This Week</h3>

<h3>Confirmation of Tibetan Troops Invading Xikang: Liu Wenhui Cables Beijing for Help</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The government confirms that the Tibetan troops on the west bank of the Jinsha River are taking advantage of Liu Wenhui's internal war and the lack of supplies and equipment to advance into Xikang under the pretext of assisting the lamas of the Da Jin and Qing Ke monasteries in returning to their temples, violating the agreement. Although the government sent a telegram to stop them, the Dalai Lama's reply was evasive, and in fact, the military operations have not stopped. Liu Wenhui sent another telegram yesterday asking for help and requesting supplies. It is reported that the authorities have sent another</p>
<p>telegram to Liu Xiang, asking him to assist nearby. The Qinghai-Tibet border is currently very peaceful because the province has deployed considerable forces in the Yushu area, which is sufficient to deal with everything. The area is located in the upper reaches of the Jinsha River and forms a triangle with Qamdo on the west bank of the Jinsha River and Derge on the east bank. If the Tibetan troops invade eastward, the troops stationed in Yushu can intercept them at any time. The Tibetan troops will definitely not dare to attack "Derge" and "Ganyu" eastward on one side and provoke the Qing army on the other. When necessary, the Tibetan side may ask the Qing province authorities to abide by the Yushu Agreement and ease the threat from the north. Rumors that the Qinghai-Tibet border defense is tight are not taken seriously here. What is being paid attention to is finding an effective way to resolve the disputes between Xikang and Tibet. As for the Qinghai-Tibet border defense, the order is only to avoid misunderstandings. (Special telegram on the 18th)</p>
<h3>Guizhou War Comes to an End: Che Wuyi's Troops Withdraw from Putian, Wang Jialie's Situation Improves Again</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Beijing side obtained the latest truth about the Guizhou War. The original text said that the Guizhou War has become increasingly fierce since the eastern route reopened fire. On the Allied Forces side, Lei Wujiu occupied Sinan from Songtao, and Yang Qichang of Yinjiang also attacked into the area of Mijiachang in Jiangkou. Che Mingyi took the opportunity to attack Zhenyuan from Qingxi Yuping. After more than ten days of bitter fighting, Wang Jialie, suffering from the oppression of the Yunnan army, was unable to take care of the western route of Huajiang River and the eastern route. As a result, Liao Huaizhong's isolated army was cut off from aid and retreated to Shiqian, and Pi Depei, the deputy commander of the first division, died in the fall of Zhenyuan City. Pi was the commander of the seventh division during the Zhou Cheng era and is now the deputy commander of He Zhiren. Surrounded on all sides, Guiyang was shaken. Yu Jialie changed his attitude towards Liu Mingjie and sent Bai Huizhang, the commander of the second division, and three regiments including Li Niansun to the east to besiege for seven days. Che's army was defeated, and Che himself withdrew from Putian, 20 miles away from Zhenyuan. Hundreds of people who died in artillery fire and arson died with their families. Mao Guangyao, who was supported by the Allied Forces, was shot and killed by Hou Zhi, because his representative Chuan Changmin. Qiu Yunchang also disappeared in Shanghai after a conflict with Zisheng. A special express telegram was sent to the Allied Forces generals, expressing a negative statement that he would never open or read letters and telegrams from all parties again. As a result, the Allied Forces suddenly lost their support and were not easy to unite. Wang Jialie's situation improved. (Special telegram on the 18th)</p>

(Special telegram on the 18th) (Nanchang) Zixi Xingxing and Yihuang have been occupied by bandits for a long time, and farmers have been displaced. The Rural Cooperative Society has assigned personnel to run farmers' lending offices. (Special telegram on the 18th)</p>
<p>The bandits entrenched in the city of Zixi County were fiercely attacked by the Xing Division for a day and a night. The bandits suffered heavy casualties and fled into Guangze territory.

There were many deaths. The Central Army has occupied Yuancun and Dongshan. (Central News Agency telegram on the 18th)</p>
<p>(Nanchang) In the battle of Yuancun, the bandits set up an ambush in the deep mountains, seemingly trying to lure the Central Army deep and attack them fiercely. Unexpectedly, the advance of the □□ Regiment was rapid and the momentum was too strong. The Li□□ Regiment advanced to Baogai Peak and entered the vicinity of Yuancun. The bandit army was unable to counterattack, so they gathered the pseudo-Third Army and besieged it with the 456th divisions, stubbornly resisting. The two regiments of the Central Army fought hand-to-hand and charged. The fierce battle lasted until Shenshi (3-5 pm). Because it was close to dusk, the □ Regiment occupied the heights of Cuodouzhai and built fortifications to hold on. Although the bandits launched a fierce attack at night, they were unable to succeed. At dawn on the 13th, the Central Army launched a full-line attack and the bandits collapsed and retreated to Dongshan and Xiong Village. In this battle, more than 2,000 bandits were killed. In the early morning, our army cleared the position and found more than 1,100 bandit corpses and more than 100 abandoned wounded bandits, and captured 12 heavy machine guns and 542 rifles. (Central News Agency telegram on the 18th)</p>
<p>(Nanchang) According to official reports, the bandits who fought in the battle of Yuancun were the 456th divisions of the pseudo-Third Army Corps, the 13th Division of the pseudo-Fifth Army Corps, and the 24th Division of the pseudo-Seventh Army Corps. After a day of fierce fighting, they charged back and forth, and more than 1,000 bandits were killed on the spot. Our left-wing division seized more than ten heavy machine guns and hundreds of rifles from the bandits. The Zhao Regiment seized more than 500 heavy machine guns, submachine guns, and rifles from the bandits, and captured many trophies such as the regimental flag of the 11th regiment of the pseudo-Fourth Division.

<p>(Nanchang) Chairman Chiang Kai-shek ordered that salt transportation during the blockade must be escorted by the military. He also ordered all departments to rectify discipline. If there are cases of setting up bureaus to collect donations, occupying civilian property, privately transporting salt, and intercepting tax money among the departments, which are bad habits of warlords, the officers in charge should be ordered to investigate and deal with them severely.

<h3>Matsuoka's Declaration: Destroy the Party to Save the Country! Dissolve Political Parties, Preserve Patriotic Associations, Stop the Struggle, and Cooperate Nationally: Aim to Overcome Difficulties in Five Years</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Matsuoka Yosuke gave his first opinion in Tokyo on the 17th after withdrawing from the Seiyukai, advocating the establishment of a one-nation-one-body principle and the immediate dissolution of political parties. The title of his speech was "Telling the People in Extraordinary Times." The speech lasted for four hours. His opinion on the dissolution of political parties is as follows: Party politics is something borrowed from foreign countries. Japan has learned from the experience of the past fifty years that its political progress is not as smooth as that of Britain and the United States. However, the theory of dissolving political parties that we advocate does not deny parliamentary politics. Even without political parties, the parliament can exert its functions. The existing political parties are organs for contending for political power, but they are only groups of many people who have come together for the sake of ensuring common interests. The purpose of Japanese politics is to build parliamentary politics, not to make party politics the goal. However, it is ridiculous that the number of party members in the parliament determines the outcome of the vote. If political parties can be dissolved, then everyone can freely express their opinions. I strongly advocate that Japan, in the next five years, stop all class struggles and struggles between political parties, and that the people should cooperate with one accord to deal with the domestic and foreign difficulties.

<h3>A Glimpse of the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic</h3>
<p>(Moscow, November 16, Tas News Agency) Before the revolution, 70% of the population of Byelorussia was illiterate. Now, all children are enrolled in school, and there are almost no illiterate adults. The area has 4 million hectares of arable land. This year, 2,000 cultivators are working, and mixing machines are being used for the first time. There are 56 electrified collective farms in the country, dozens of cultivator stations and repair workshops, 14 electrified state-owned farms, about 100 electric harvesters, and 138 mobile power machines. Before the revolution, the republic had almost no industry, but the industrial output in the first three quarters of this year has reached 72 million rubles. Investment in industry this year has reached 12 million rubles. The Kremlikovichi artificial building materials factory has just started construction, the Gomel Mechanical Research Institute is under construction, and the Minsk Institute of Technology will open soon.</p>
<h3>France's Attitude is Firm: Extremely Opposed to Changing the Status Quo, Avenol Arrives in Paris from England</h3>
<p>(Paris) Secretary-General Avenol arrived here from London for a week's stay, so discussions on the future of the League of Nations have also moved here with Avenol. Today, Avenol has visited French Prime Minister Doumergue and will also meet with President Lebrun and Foreign Minister Boncour. The French government is now eagerly awaiting the arrival of British Foreign Secretary Simon, but it is expected that although Simon will be good at persuading, he will definitely not be able to make France change its extremely opposed attitude towards Germany's rearmament or any fundamental reform of the League of Nations.

<h3>Britain is Unwilling to Take the Initiative in Reforming the League of Nations: MacDonald Opposes Forming a Committee</h3>

<h3>The League of Nations' Crisis Lies in the Failure to Implement Key Treaty Articles</h3>
<p>(Paris) The French League of Nations Support Association held its annual meeting today at the International Institute for Intellectual Cooperation. At the beginning of the meeting, it unanimously passed a resolution stating that the League of Nations' illness does not lie in the Covenant itself, as its original provisions can be amended. The root cause of the illness is the failure to fully implement the main provisions of the Covenant. The Association decided to study various plans to improve international organizations and to seek the unification of European countries. The association is also willing to support direct talks between governments, but believes that the results of such negotiations should not go beyond the scope of the League of Nations. (Havas dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The French League of Nations Support Association today invited the Greek Ambassador to France, Mr. Politis, to give a lecture at the International Institute for Intellectual Cooperation on the issue of non-aggression treaties. Mr. Politis said that the Locarno Treaty is a model for non-aggression treaties, and such treaties only arise after international unrest, so they can be seen as a result of the volatile situation. Mr. Politis then praised the Soviet Union's proposed "definition of aggression," saying that since the establishment of the definition of an aggressor, the use of provocation by other countries as an excuse to engage in war, as in the past, is no longer tenable. He also said, "The efforts of the Balkan Peninsula towards peace have been considerable. Since the signing of the non-aggression treaty between Romania and Turkey on October 17 this year, the countries of the Balkan Peninsula, which used to be a source of conflict, have now joined hands and are gradually changing their narrow, local nature of the old Balkan region." Mr. Politis finally said that the small countries have great faith in the future of the League of Nations, but it is strange that some countries demanding equal rights want to restrict the rights of small countries and fundamentally transform the League of Nations. After Mr. Politis finished speaking, the Secretary-General of the League of Nations, Mr. Avenol, gave a speech, saying that the crisis of the League of Nations is one aspect of the world panic. If the world panic stops, then the crisis of the League of Nations will also disappear. (Havas dispatch, 17th)</p>
<h3>France and Italy Should Be Friendly Italian Cabinet Member Gives Speech in Paris</h3>
<p>(Paris) Italian Minister Without Portfolio Count Volpi is scheduled to give a speech tomorrow on Franco-Italian friendship and its future. Today, he gave a long interview to a Havas reporter, repeatedly explaining the reasons why France and Italy must be close, saying that the people of France and Italy are of the same race, have the same culture, and fought together during the European War for many years. Their mutual union is natural. Pan-nationalism, in its own sense, wants to make countries responsible for both domestic and foreign affairs. The Italian government, based on this concept of responsibility, has signed treaties of compromise and cooperation with the other three major powers. This concept has been recognized by the League of Nations, because the countries that signed the Four-Power Pact are all permanent members of the League of Nations Council. In Count Volpi's view, the fundamental weakness of the League of Nations lies in the United States' failure to join. Although President Wilson was the founder of the League of Nations, the Treaty of Versailles was rejected by the U.S. Senate, resulting in the founder being excluded from the matter. In addition, the Soviet Union's unwillingness to join, and the successive withdrawal of Japan and Germany from the League, have made the League of Nations even weaker, which we should be clear about. However, we cannot say that we do not trust the League of Nations just because we point out its weaknesses. Count Volpi then briefly explained how the reforms carried out by Italy in accordance with corporatism have been effective, and said that if this corporatism can be universally implemented, it will be of great benefit to solving the world panic.

<h3>Italian Newspaper Criticizes the Treaty System Countries Advocates Accepting Germany's Demands</h3>
<p>Rome Recently, the disharmonious tones in the European situation, on the one hand, are the mediation negotiations between the great powers, and on the other hand, the opposition of the Little Entente countries to the revision of the treaties. This situation has once again aroused the Italian newspapers' criticism of the League of Nations. The Italian People's Daily said that their "die-hard" faction against the reorganization of the League of Nations mostly consists of countries that were produced or expanded by the treaty, and that the most serious criticism of the League of Nations now is that the nest of peace doves has been collapsed by the weight of various military and political special treaties between member countries. The tone of the Sara Daily is roughly the same as that of the People's Daily, saying that the political situation in Europe is like "upside down." The newspaper also congratulates the willingness of Germany and Italy to conduct negotiations side by side, and says that Italy wants to see the tension between France and Germany reduced, and that Italy deeply feels that a country like Germany should never be permanently shackled. Therefore, for the sake of today, concentrating various forces to agree to Germany's most urgent needs is the best guarantee for long-term peace in Europe. (National News, 17th)</p>
<h3>The German Reichstag Fire</h3>
<p>Becomes a Major Suspicious Case Demonstration by British Communists</p>
<p>(London) Two hundred communists held a demonstration near the German Embassy to protest the German Supreme Court's trial of the Reichstag fire case. The communists once broke through the police cordon. The police used batons to beat them, resulting in a conflict, and many people were arrested. Although the communists were repelled, they refused to give in and caused disturbances again. Police reinforcements arrived and prevented the demonstrators from approaching the embassy, but allowed union secretary Thomas to submit a petition to the embassy, which stated, "The Reichstag fire case is a fabricated act. All the defendants are falsely accused. The people of the London trade union movement and thousands of workers demand their release and have sent a delegation to request an audience." When the communists caught sight of a group of pan-nationalists in the crowd, another conflict broke out. Mounted police rushed back and forth to drive away the people, causing minor injuries to many people. The demonstrators were finally dispersed, and the police guarded the embassy area all night.

<h3>Romain Rolland Appeals to Germany</h3>
<p>To Release Defendants in Reichstag Fire Case</p>
<p>(Paris) French writer Romain Rolland published a public letter requesting the release of the four communist defendants in the German Reichstag fire case: Georgi Dimitrov, Blagoy Popov, and Vasil Tanev. Rolland told Germany, "The great German nation is admired by the world. It must urgently protest against this fabricated political prosecution. The German people and we all know that Dimitrov, Torgler, Popov, and Tanev are innocent. We hope that Germany can recognize the absurdity of this accusation against four political enemies of the current authorities. At the same time, after the verdict, it should protect their lives, because Germany should be responsible for their lives in front of the world." (TASS, 16th)</p>
<p>(London) Today, about two hundred communists, including women, marched in formation from the West End of London, broke through the police cordon near the German Embassy, and demonstrated at the German Embassy against the trial of the Reichstag fire case. The police, with the assistance of mounted police, used batons to attack the crowd, and the demonstrators dispersed. Many people were arrested. Finally, a demonstrator was allowed by the authorities to submit a petition to the German Embassy requesting the release of the defendants in the arson case. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<h3>Roosevelt's Recovery Movement</h3>
<p>Is Almost Spent Production and Sales Continue to Decline Gold Purchase Policy Has Little Effect (Washington) The National Industrial Council's November report stated that production and sales continue to decline, department store sales are lower than before, and the number of workers employed in factories has decreased for the first time since March. The sharp drop in industrial production is especially severe in the automobile and steel industries. However, the electricity, public works, and bituminous coal industries are still in good shape. Car loadings are down 11%. The difference between farmers' income and the prices they pay is 41% lower than the pre-war average. The standard of living is 3% lower, the first decline since April. Commercial bankruptcies increased by 26%. The decrease in employment in several large industries cannot be offset by the increase in employment in other industries. (Reuters, 17th) (Washington) Today, the most informed sources here mostly believe that the U.S. government wants to devalue the gold price to 50%, but the method used may be changed, because the current gold purchase plan of the Financial Relief Corporation, although it looks like a victory, has little practical effect. (National News, 17th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Secretary of Commerce Roper issued the Department of Commerce's annual report today, saying that there were signs of resisting contraction in the first quarter of 1933. In the second quarter, the trend of contraction had indeed subsided, because the government's firm actions greatly strengthened public trust and greatly activated transactions. By the end of the fiscal year, there should be substantial progress. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Secretary of Commerce Roper recently submitted his annual report to President Roosevelt, saying that if the world's economic problems are to be finally resolved, it must rely on international consultations and concrete actions to eliminate obstacles to business recovery. The world's businesses are now showing signs of recovery, but excessive trade restrictions, chaotic financial situations, heavy debt burdens, unstable exchange rates, and commercial downturns are all factors that delay the recovery of various important businesses. Regarding the domestic economy, he said that President Roosevelt's actions have strengthened credit, stimulated business, and partially resolved the unemployment problem. (Havas, 18th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Recovery Administrator Johnson announced today that the automobile industry code, originally scheduled to expire at the end of this month, has been granted a six-month extension at the request of the American Automobile Association.

<p>(Washington) The most authoritative American economist, Brooklyn College, stated in a report written by its famous financial expert, Bassie Voulsky, that the U.S. gold policy cannot be relied upon to restore prices and may be a powerful cause of hindering recovery. It also said that the overseas Chinese professor's gold theory is completely inapplicable to the complex new world, and even with the National Recovery Act, it will not be effective. The price level does not correspond to the increase in gold prices. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<h3>Weaknesses of the U.S. Navy Construction Director Feels Lack of Funding</h3>
<p>(Washington) Today, the annual report of the Director of Naval Construction of the United States, Lante, was released. According to the report, the United States, in terms of the navy, strives to be equal to other countries and not inferior to others, but if no additional budget is allocated in the future, by the end of 1936, it will still be far below the treaty limit. According to the navy, the U.S. auxiliary ships are far below the proper limit. These auxiliary ships, from the Eagle boats built by Ford during the war, to oil tankers and crane ships, etc., are all included. Although they were not strictly limited in the London Treaty, there are currently only eighty ships that can be actively used. In addition, Lante also deeply regretted the lack of funding in his office, which resulted in many warships stationed at home and abroad not being repaired for years. (National News, 17th)</p>
<h3>Pan-American Conference Cheers Loudly Congratulating the Satisfactory Resolution of the Colombia-Peru Dispute Next Conference to be Held in Lima, Peru</h3>
<p>Montevideo Today, the Pan-American Conference decided that the next conference will be held in Lima, the capital of Peru. When Colombian representative Lopez announced that the next conference site would be in Lima, it would be a great commemoration of the satisfactory resolution of the Leticia dispute between Peru and Colombia. All the representatives congratulated each other and cheered loudly. Leticia is a small town in the Amazon River basin with only 500 residents, located near the border of Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Brazil. In 1928, Peru gave Leticia to Colombia in exchange for other land. Last September, unofficial Peruvian troops suddenly took advantage of the opportunity to occupy the town, and the Peruvian government assisted them, which led to war in February this year. Later, the League of Nations and other peace organizations helped to peacefully resolve the conflict and agreed on a treaty. (National News, 17th)</p>
<h3>Paraguayan Military Reports Victory Occupied Six Bolivian Forts in Ten Days Captured Over 10,000 Officers and Soldiers</h3>
<p>Asunción Today received the good news from the Chaco area. The Paraguayan army took advantage of the victory and advanced, and has already occupied the extremely important Bolivian fort. This is the sixth Bolivian fort occupied in the past ten days. Therefore, the good news spread and the whole country celebrated. The Chief of Staff of the Army declared that the war situation has shifted, and Paraguay can be expected to win a complete victory in a short period of time. Since the 7th of this month, it has captured a total of 250 Bolivian officers and more than 10,000 soldiers. However, since Paraguay has repeatedly won victories in the past two weeks, its government leaders today seem unwilling to discuss peace proposals hastily. Therefore, although the Paraguayan and Bolivian governments have tried to agree to the peace proposals of the Pan-American Conference and the League of Nations, the representatives of the two countries and the representatives of neutral countries will peacefully negotiate all disputes. The Pan-American Conference has also elected a subcommittee to handle the matter, but the Paraguayan representatives may attempt to delay the convening of this meeting. (National News, 17th)</p>
<h3>Gunfire in the Cuban Capital Famous Newspaper Destroyed Four Dead and Six Seriously Injured</h3>
<p>Havana Today, mobs in the Cuban capital destroyed the El País newspaper again, firing hundreds of shots, killing four people and seriously injuring at least six. At the same time, there were shootings and snipings throughout the city. There were no less than twenty shooting battles near the newspaper. El País is one of the famous newspapers in Cuba, and it is very opposed to President San Martín, so it is deeply resented by some people.</p>

<h3>British House of Lords Reform Plan Reduce Number of Members Increase Power</h3>
<p>(London) The House of Lords will submit the House of Lords Reform Plan tomorrow, proposed by the Marquess of Salisbury. It is expected that the first reading can pass the outline, without discussing the details, in order to solicit opinions. However, it is heard that the Marquess of Salisbury will propose that the number of members of the House of Lords, except for the Princes of the Blood, the Law Lords, and the religious leaders, should be reduced from seven hundred to five hundred. The House of Lords should have the power to delay legislation pending the consent of the people, and form a joint committee with the House of Commons on the approval of monetary bills. The government is now closely monitoring the trend of public opinion, because the cabinet members believe that the government should handle the reform of the House of Lords during this parliamentary term.

<h3>New Spanish Government Completely Relies on Royalist Support</h3>
<p>Madrid The Spanish cabinet today completely relies on the support of the Royalists, which is the first time since the establishment of the republic. The Roman Catholic Popular Party has reportedly accepted the republican system on the advice of the Pope and on the condition of deleting the anti-religious clauses in the constitution. The extreme Royalists are therefore very angry and denounce Robles as a traitor. However, in order to avoid forcing the new Prime Minister Lerroux to rely on the Socialist Party, the mixed government can be guaranteed not to split. The Socialist Party has threatened that if it tries to undermine the constitution, the party will carry out a national revolution. Today, the police searched an organization in a certain building here and copied out many documents. Therefore, it is known that the scope of the recent anarchist revolution is as wide as the whole country, and several people have been arrested, including a famous doctor and two beautiful girls. It is now believed that they are the masterminds of the conspiracy. (Reuters, 18th)</p>

<h3>Chinese and Japanese Representatives Meet in Tianjin to Discuss Taking Over Shanhaiguan</h3>
<p>Both sides set a date to arrive in Tianjin. The Japanese side is determined to forcibly occupy the pseudo-organs in Dongluocheng and will not withdraw.</p>
<p>Beiping Communication: Due to the Japanese side creating extra problems in the issue of taking over Shanhaiguan, it was decided to hold another meeting to negotiate everything in order to resolve it as soon as possible. The day before yesterday, Tao Shangming came to Beiping from Tianjin to meet Huang Fu and make some requests. That afternoon, he visited Shibayama, the military attaché of the Japanese embassy, and agreed to convene a meeting in Tianjin immediately to invite Iga, the chief of the Japanese special service agency stationed in Shanhaiguan, to attend the meeting in Tianjin. Shibayama sent a telegram to Iga to seek consent. This morning (16th), Iga replied to Beiping, agreeing to arrive in Tianjin tomorrow night (17th). After receiving the telegram, Shibayama informed our side that our representatives Tao Shangming, Zhu Shiqin, etc., decided to go to Tianjin with Shibayama at 4 pm tomorrow (17th) to hold a meeting in Tianjin immediately to discuss the detailed rules for the takeover. The attendees at the meeting on our side will be Tao Shangming, Zhu Shiqin, and Yuan Tai, the magistrate of Linyu County. On the Japanese side, there will be Iga, Shibayama, and Umezu, the commander of the North China Garrison Army. Whether the issue of taking over Shanhaiguan can be concluded after this negotiation is still questionable. Although the Japanese side has agreed in principle to return Shanhaiguan, it has created many difficulties and side issues. For example, the Japanese side is determined to occupy Dongluocheng outside the east gate of Yucheng and the first and fifth districts under the county for a long time, citing that the two districts are outside Shanhaiguan and should be the territory of the puppet state. At the same time, the puppet state organs in Shanhaiguan originally promised to move out of the customs and build houses in Dongluocheng for relocation. However, recently, the Japanese side has again cited that there are no suitable houses outside the customs, requiring to stay in Yucheng and borrow land to work. The action is quite ridiculous. Judging from the situation in all aspects, it is difficult to predict whether the takeover issue can get a good result at this Tianjin meeting. According to Shibayama, the military attaché of the Japanese embassy, "The Shanhaiguan takeover incident is still in progress these days. There is no problem in principle. Dongluocheng is outside Shanhaiguan and is naturally a territory of 'Manchukuo'. It cannot be mentioned in the same breath as Shanhaiguan. The 'Manchukuo' organs in Shanhaiguan City cannot be moved temporarily because there are no suitable houses outside the customs, so they borrow the place to work. After the Shanhaiguan takeover, they will absolutely not interfere in your country's (referring to China) local administration. The local maintenance association organized by the Shanhaiguan merchants will be abolished immediately. The two regiments of Japanese troops stationed there, about 300 people, can also be withdrawn outside the customs after the takeover," and so on. (December 16)</p>
<p>Another report says that due to numerous side issues, it is difficult to take over Shanhaiguan this year. At the earliest, it can be handled in January next year. However, the Japanese side recently advocated that we can restore the special public security bureau first. The authorities are considering this carefully. It is said that when taking over Shanhaiguan in the future, they will avoid talking about the Dongluocheng issue. According to relevant sources, although the Japanese side has not formally proposed the request to assign Dongluocheng to the pseudo-territory, in fact, the Japanese side had already changed Luocheng and the first and fifth districts of Linyu into the "assumed ninth and tenth districts of Suizhong County" on November 2, and set up the "Suizhong County Ninth and Tenth Districts Office" in Luocheng. The Japanese have already regarded Luocheng and the first and fifth districts of Linyu as pseudo-territories and forcibly occupied them without making a request to our side. Secondly, the Japanese side has no intention of withdrawing the pseudo-customs, the pseudo-border police team, and the pseudo-telephone bureau outside the south gate of Shanhaiguan, wanting to stand against our organs after the takeover and make it difficult for us in administration. Then the Shanhaiguan that is taken over is an empty city in fact and in form. Tao Shangming, the Administrative Inspector of the Luanyu District, has set a date to go to Tianjin again to contact the Japanese side. Tao said, "In the future, we plan to take over Shanhaiguan first, and the trivial issues will be handled in order after the takeover. I visited Chairman Huang on the 15th and discussed the specific opinions of our side on taking over Shanhaiiguan. Then, on the 16th, I went to Tianjin to wait for Iga to discuss the takeover procedures. If Iga does not come, I will wait for Director Yin (Yin Rugeng) to return to Tianjin and make some contacts on the points related to the takeover of Shanhaiiguan and the opening of traffic, and then go to Shanhaiguan to meet with Iga, hoping to take over Shanhaiiguan in a short period of time. "Yin Rugeng, the Administrative Inspector of the Jiyu District, went to Tianjin a few days ago to visit Yu Xuezhong and ask for instructions on everything. The morning before yesterday, he took a car to Tong County and returned to Beiping that night. Yin made the following remarks, "The Tong County Confucian Temple has now been repaired and completed. It has been decided to formally establish the public office on the 18th of this month and start work. Today, we have issued an order to the county magistrates of the ten counties in this district to gather at the public office on the 21st of this month to hold a meeting, and invite Wei Yonghe, the captain of the Second Security Brigade, to attend the meeting to discuss the administrative reorganization of this district. On the 24th and 25th, I will set off to inspect the counties. The Japanese side has already returned the local administration of Gubeikou. However, our security team has not yet entered. When I was on patrol, I went to Gubeikou in person to contact the Japanese garrison commander and prepared to implement the takeover in January next year." (16th)</p>

The lawyers for the defendants, Lu Longxiang, Wu Chengbi, Lu Liang, Zhang Chongding, etc., appeared in court. The court summoned Wang Ayue, the teahouse waiter of the Jiuhua Hotel, to testify, stating that he had gone to Hangtou with Captain Yang to capture the accomplices but failed. Then, the defendants such as Xie Weisheng were summoned for re-interrogation. The defendants still denied it. The judge ordered the start of the debate and invited the prosecutor to the court. Prosecutor Zhu stated the circumstances of the defendants' crimes, the intention to prosecute, and according to Xu Guanxiang's original confession, half a month before the incident, Xie Weisheng, his wife and concubine, and Jiang Ahe discussed it at the Jiuhua Hotel.

The bandits put it in their arms and ran away, shouting and screaming.</p>
<h3>Boundary Dispute over the Construction of a Dam at the Junction of Wuxi and Chengjiang</h3>
<p>At the junction of the Seventh District of our county and the Thirteenth District of Jiangyin, there is a newly built dam, which was built by the Thirteenth District of Jiangyin by recruiting workers. It has been several years. Recently, Yan Genxiang and other farmers from Zhaimen in the Seventh District of our county have submitted a petition to the Second District Commissioner's Office because the newly built dam has blocked the source of field water and affected farmland water conservancy, requesting the Commissioner's Office to send personnel to investigate, dismantle, and rebuild the bridge. After receiving the petition, Commissioner Cai immediately ordered the county governments of Wuxi and Chengjiang to investigate and reply, and appointed Chief Officer Hong Changyi to come to Wuxi to investigate thoroughly. Hong arrived in Wuxi the day before yesterday afternoon and transferred to a car to go to the Jiangyin County Government for contact first. The Jiangyin County Government sent personnel to accompany Chief Officer Hong and jointly commissioned the Wuxi County Government to go to the countryside to conduct an on-site investigation. It is scheduled to return to Changzhou this morning to report.</p>

When they reached the vicinity of the First Teahouse, six or seven thugs suddenly sprang out from the roadside, shouting them to stop. They rushed forward and snatched 17 bolts of blue cloth from Wang Zhongda's shoulder. They also searched and robbed Tang Changgen's five bolts of gray striped cloth and the silver yuan on his body. Seeing the bandits going away, Wang Zhongda and others ran to the nearby public security station to report. The station immediately sent a team to pursue the bandits, but they had already fled far away.</p>

The double doors were tightly closed. The waiter knew something was wrong and pried open the door to see that he had died. A piece of prescription paper and a pawn ticket were left on the pillow. There was a lot of fresh blood spit out in the痰盂 in front of the bed. The inn immediately reported to the court for an examination. The examination revealed that the corpse had injuries to the waist, the skin was peeling off, and the whole body was purple-blue. It was verified that he had been beaten before his death and died on the way home.</p>
<h3>Qingpu</h3>

<p>Zhang Axiao, a notorious bandit from Shidang in this county, was a bandit under the command of Taibao Ashu. After being captured by the Second Detachment of the First District of the Qingpu Waterborne Provincial Public Security Bureau, his subordinates ran away to the east and west. On the 14th of this month, the police team received a report saying that Yang Axiao, the little boss of bandit leader Zhang Axiao's subordinates, was hiding near Xicen and had assassinated water police detective Bao Liansheng two years ago. After receiving the report, Captain Li Xiaotang checked the report and found that it was the same as what bandit leader Zhang Axiao had confessed in the detachment headquarters. The next morning, he sent Patrol Officer Zhou Gongda, etc., with informants, to search and arrest them. Yang Bandit was captured in Xicen Marsh.</p>

<h3>Oil Ship Sinks After Touching Anchor</h3>
<p>The Dasheng Oil Depot in Xiannvmiao, the east township of the county, recently used barges to transport oil from Zhenjiang to Xian. When passing through Jianggia Bridge in the town, it happened that two old fishing boats of Xuyuanji were moored there and anchored in the river without setting up anchor buoys, causing the bottom of the ship carrying oil in Dasheng to be damaged by the anchor teeth. River water invaded, and people on the boat cried for help. Fortunately, neighboring boats went to the rescue and transported the goods to other boats, avoiding losses. The oil ship contacted Xuyuanji and negotiated a settlement through Renji mediation.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou</h3>
<p>The Security Bureau Executes Red Pill Criminals: The Zhejiang Provincial Security Bureau, according to the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway Inspection Team, sent three individuals, Si Zhenghong, Jiang Sidi, and Zheng Chaoyun, who were carrying red pills. There were 110 bags of red pills, weighing a total of 772 taels. They requested interrogation and handling. Upon investigation, it was found that Si Zhenghong and Jiang Sidi were soldiers of the Ninth Division, and Zheng Chaoyun was a retired military officer of the Sixth Division. The red pills were being sold by Zheng Chaoyun, and Si Zhenghong and others were escorting them. They intended to transport them to Shangrao, Jiangxi, to sell them.

They were discovered and sent to the bureau. After interrogation and conviction, they were sentenced to death according to the law. Yesterday, on the 18th, at 8:00 AM, officials were dispatched to verify the identities of Si Zhenghong, Jiang Sidi, and Zheng Chaoyun, and they were taken to the No. 1 Wharf in Jianggan to be executed by shooting.</p>

<h3>Sun Ke and Wife to Depart Shanghai for Hong Kong and the Philippines Tonight: He Declares Before Departure That This Trip is a Christmas Vacation and Not Politically Motivated; Informs Chiang Kai-shek by Telegram Before Leaving; May Visit Hu Hanmin in Hong Kong for a Day Before Returning to Shanghai by the Original Ship</h3>
<p>Sun Ke, President of the Legislative Yuan, who came to Shanghai, is scheduled to leave Shanghai with his wife on the Great Eastern Shipping Company's ship "President Hoover" at 10:00 PM today, bound for Hong Kong and then the Philippines, for a sea voyage. Mr. Sun will take the last small ferry across the river at 8:45 PM today to Pudong to board the ship and depart. Various parties concerned in this port plan to go to the wharf to see him off at that time. Mr. Sun's trip has attracted considerable attention from the outside world because the Central Government had intended to invite Mr. Sun to go south to Hong Kong and Guangdong. However, Mr. Sun stated yesterday that this trip has nothing to do with politics and is purely a Christmas vacation. This is because Mrs. Sun has recently been suffering from insomnia, and the doctor has instructed Mrs. Sun to take a sea voyage to restore the function of her nervous system. Therefore, Mr. Sun is taking advantage of the year-end holiday to go to the Philippines for a Christmas vacation. He plans to rest for a day or two after arriving in Manila and then return to Shanghai on the original ship "President Hoover," arriving in Shanghai around January 1st. It is expected that during this trip, he may also take the opportunity to meet with Mr. Hu Zhantang (Hu Hanmin) in Hong Kong if he has time. It is heard that Mr. Sun, in order to prevent misunderstandings about his trip, has already telegraphed Chiang Kai-shek, Chairman of the Nanchang Military Council, to inform him of this trip.</p>

<h3>Shanghai-Fujian Telegrams Still Open Amidst Reports of Contact on the Fujian-Zhejiang Border; Commercial Reports Delayed Due to Congestion</h3>
<p>The New Sound News Agency reports that in Pucheng and Jianning in northern Fujian, near the Zhejiang border, there were previous reports that the so-called People's Revolutionary Army of Fujian had begun contact with the Central Army. However, wired telegrams between Shanghai and Fuzhou are still unimpeded. This line passes through Jiangshan in Zhejiang, crosses Xianxia Ridge, and passes through Pucheng, Jianyang, and Jian'ou (i.e., Jianning). If the two sides formally engage, the telegraph line will inevitably be interrupted. However, commercial reports between Shanghai and Fujian are quite delayed, often exceeding two hours. According to news from the Telegraph Bureau, this line was originally used exclusively for direct communication between Shanghai and Fujian, with the remainder being used for communication between local areas. Due to the recent extreme congestion in Jiangshan, Pucheng, Jianning, and other places, the original telegraph lines are insufficient. Therefore, the direct line is sometimes used as a local line for adjustment, resulting in commercial reports between Fuzhou being delayed compared to before.</p>
<h3>Contact Imminent on the Front Line: Fujian Troops Advance Towards Xiapu</h3>
<p>The New Sound News Agency reports that, according to official sources in this city, contact has occurred on the front line in northern Fujian. This has not yet been officially confirmed. However, according to various intelligence reports, the Mao Weisou unit of the 19th Route Army is indeed advancing step by step towards northern Fujian, namely Xiapu, south of the Fengshuiguan Pass in the Wen district of Zhejiang Province, hoping to spy on Zhejiang. Therefore, contact with the Central Army may not be far off. Yue Fang's ambition to invade Zhejiang has gradually become apparent. He has already handed over southern and western Fujian to the Communist bandits for takeover. At the same time, he has used approximately several thousand troops and bandits, combined them with Tan Qixiu's unit, and concentrated them in Gutian to prevent the Central Army's Liu Heding unit from directly taking the Fujian provincial capital. In total, more than 17,000 Communist bandits are participating in Fujian's military operations. Therefore, Fujian's alliance with the Communists can no longer be concealed.</p>
<h3>Huang Shaoxiong Discusses His Trip to Mongolia: Autonomous Region Governments Established in Chahar and Suiyuan Except for Provincial Jurisdiction; He Will Report to Chiang Kai-shek in Gan After Returning to Beijing</h3>
<p>Huang Shaoxiong, Minister of the Interior, was previously ordered by the Central Government to go to Inner Mongolia to promote autonomy. He has now completed his mission and returned south the day before yesterday, passing through Beijing to Shanghai. Yesterday morning, he met with reporters from various newspapers at his residence on West Aixiangs Road and gave the following talk.</p>
<h3>Autonomous Region Governments Established Separately in Chahar and Suiyuan</h3>
<p>Mr. Huang first stated that the method of Inner Mongolian autonomy has now been decided to establish autonomous regions in Chahar and Suiyuan provinces respectively. The establishment of these two autonomous regions does not conflict with the provincial regions. Their nature is like that of Jiangsu and Shanghai City. All administration is subject to the Central Government. The organizational regulations of the autonomous regions are still awaiting the decision of the Central Political Council and passage by the Executive Yuan and the Legislative Yuan. The location of the autonomous region government has not yet been determined. It will likely be established in a place with a concentrated population within each region. As for the candidates for the autonomous region governments, Mongolians will be the main candidates. However, at the beginning of the organization, the Central Government will definitely send personnel to guide them. However, whether the Central Government will permanently send personnel to reside there has not yet been determined. It is recently heard that the princes of Inner Mongolia are extremely grateful that the Central Government has agreed to grant autonomy and provide practical guidance. At present, the princes plan to send representatives to Beijing to pay their respects to the central authorities to express their gratitude and make some requests.</p>
<h3>Rumors About This Movement are Self-Defeating</h3>
<p>Mr. Huang continued, "I stayed in Inner Mongolia for over two months. Although the climate there is cold, it is not as severe as imagined due to the dry air. The Inner Mongolian compatriots are all nomadic, coming early and leaving late, and their residences are not fixed. It is rare to see five people living together. Administrative and educational facilities are fundamentally out of the question. The motivation for this autonomy movement is very pure and sincere. Rumors that there is some background, etc., will now be self-defeating."</p>
<h3>Written Report to be Completed Soon</h3>
<p>Mr. Huang also said, "I was ordered to go there this time, and the results obtained were extremely satisfactory. The written report to the Central Government is mostly completed and will be finalized within the next week. The content is divided into two aspects: one aspect is to report on the process, and the other is to make suggestions. Most of it can be published in the future."</p>
<h3>Sun Dianying's Troops to Stay in Baotou for the Winter</h3>
<p>Regarding the transfer of Sun Dianying's troops to Qinghai, Mr. Huang said that due to the severe weather, the Central Government has ordered that Sun's troops temporarily stay in Baotou, Wuyuan, and Linghe for the winter, and continue to move forward later.</p>
<h3>The Situation in North China is Still Relatively Stable</h3>
<p>Regarding the Japanese army's invasion of Chahar and the rumors arising from Zhang Xueliang's return to China in North China, Mr. Huang told reporters that he had only seen reports about the Japanese army attacking Chahar with heavy troops and attacking certain units. He had not heard of it when he returned north. Whether Zhang's motive for returning to China was in response to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's telegram is unknown. However, the situation in North China is still relatively stable, and the various rumors are not credible. Furthermore, on the way back south, he went to Taiyuan, Shanxi, to meet with Mr. Yan Xishan to discuss the autonomy of Inner Mongolia, but he was not ordered to represent the Central Government to urge Mr. Yan to come to Beijing to attend the Fourth Plenary Session.</p>
<h3>No Intention to Go South, Returning to Beijing Tonight</h3>
<p>Finally, when reporters asked whether he would follow Zhang Puquan and others to Guangdong and Guangxi to mediate the situation, Mr. Huang answered in a humorous tone, "I have traveled to and from Beiping four times and Inner Mongolia and Suiyuan five times. The total journey has reached 50,000 miles. I would be miserable if I wanted to go south again. I am afraid I have no intention of going south." He added that he would take the overnight express train back to Beijing tonight and then go to Gan to meet Chairman Chiang.</p>
<h3>Temporary Special Martial Law Imposed in the City for Three Days: Due to Strict Precautions, it is Peaceful as Usual</h3>
<p>The Central News Agency reports that the Municipal Public Security Bureau previously received a confidential report that reactionary elements would infiltrate the Chinese concession from the 17th to the 19th of this month to carry out sabotage. After receiving the report, the bureau secretly submitted it to its superiors and announced a temporary special martial law for these three days. More armed police were assigned to protect various agencies. The Municipal Public Security Bureau's former street and front street also had security teams stationed at the entrances and exits. Traffic was cut off at night from 10:00 PM to 5:00 AM. Therefore, the past two days have been peaceful as usual.</p>
<h3>Lin Zhiyuan Returned to Shanghai from Japan the Day Before Yesterday and Will Go to Gan to Meet Chiang Within Days</h3>
<p>Lin Zhiyuan, a member of the Fujian Provincial Government, secretly fled to Taiwan with He Xianzhu, chief of staff of Chen Guohui's unit, and Chen Weiyuan after the coup in Fujian Province broke out. They then went to Japan. He and Chen took a ship from Japan to Shanghai, while Lin went to Tokyo to meet with Chiang Tso-pin, China's ambassador to Japan, with whom he had a previous relationship. Recently, upon receiving a telegram from Chairman Chiang, he came to Shanghai from Japan on the Nagasaki Maru the day before yesterday. After resting for a while, he will go to Beijing and then to Gan to meet Chairman Chiang and report on the Fujian coup.</p>
<h3>Shao Lizi Went to Beijing Last Night to Return to Shaanxi</h3>
<p>Shao Lizi, Chairman of the Shaanxi Provincial Government, was previously invited by the Central Government to come south to discuss the Northwest Development Plan and to return to his hometown of Shaoxing to bury his parents. He then went to Gan to meet Chairman Chiang and report on everything. Now that everything is done, he has returned to Shanghai. He originally planned to return to Shaanxi after attending the Fourth Plenary Session, but since the Fourth Plenary Session was postponed, he took the night train to Beijing last night. After meeting with President Wang in Beijing, he will return to Shaanxi immediately.</p>
<h3>US-Philippine Deputy Governor General Hutton Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday and Took the Original Ship to the Philippines This Morning to Take Office</h3>
<p>The newly appointed Deputy Governor General of the Philippines, Mr. and Mrs. Hutton, arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon at 5:00 PM on the Great Eastern Shipping Company's ship "President Hoover" from the United States. Mr. Hutton is a director of the University of Michigan in the United States and has served as a professor of political science at the university for many years. He has a great research on political science and is therefore regarded as an authority on world politics. Mr. Hutton is also good at giving speeches. The University of Michigan Alumni Association in this city held a banquet in the Hong Kong Road Bankers' Association last night to welcome him and invited Mr. Hutton to give a speech. It is heard that Mr. Hutton will still take the original ship to the Philippines this morning to take office.</p>
<h3>Huang Naishu Departs Today: To Attend the American Postal Conference in the Capital of Egypt, Cairo; Tang Baoshu Serves as Acting Director General</h3>
<p>Huang Naishu, Director General of the Postal Administration, was appointed to go to Cairo, the capital of Egypt, to attend the American Postal Conference. He decided to take the first voyage of the Great Eastern Steamship Company's "President Garfield." Those traveling with him include advisors Huang Zengyue, K. Lide, M. Lun Da, and attendants Han Xiyuan, Mei Ding, and others, totaling six people. Because he is about to leave the country, Mr. Huang made a special trip to the Postal Administration yesterday afternoon to bid farewell to all the staff. During Mr. Huang's absence, the Ministry of Communications has ordered Tang Baoshu, Director of Postal and Remittance, to serve as acting director general. Mr. Huang completed the handover of postal affairs on the fourth of this month, and Acting Director General Tang reported to the bureau for work the next day. However, due to the busy affairs of the Postal and Remittance Bureau, he can only report to the Postal Administration after 3:00 PM every day.</p>
<h3>Reasons Why National Products Cannot be Sold Well in Southeast Asia: High Cost and Freight; Cannot Compete with Japan; Unsound Financial Turnover; Cash Payment Required at the Time of Delivery</h3>
<p>Yesterday, He Bingxian, Director of the International Trade Bureau, and Ji Zejin, Director of the Guidance Department, announced the reasons why national products cannot be sold well in Southeast Asia. In recent years, Chinese national products have become increasingly developed, and various daily necessities can gradually imitate Europe and the United States and be sold domestically. However, in various places in Southeast Asia, although local overseas Chinese love to use national products, and government officials and people greatly appreciate Chinese national products, due to various reasons, the sale of national products in that area has not developed. Recently, according to reports from local consuls, the reasons for the difficulties are roughly as follows: (1) Because domestic factories are still in their infancy and cannot produce on a large scale, the cost is still high. In addition, with freight and other expenses, the price is mostly above that of Japanese goods and cannot compete with them. (2) Because domestic factories cannot give overseas orderers a longer period of economic activity, goods must be paid for in cash upon delivery, which often makes them unable to cope due to unsound financial turnover. Japanese goods are not like this. Orderers can order as many goods as they want, and they can be sent continuously. As for the price, it can be remitted six months later. (3) Because there are no Chinese-owned ships directly to Southeast Asia, the freight is high. (4) Because there are no Chinese-run banks in Southeast Asia to circulate funds, due to these reasons, those who operate national products often give up halfway because they cannot make a profit. This is truly an obstacle to the future of national products and the reason why they cannot compete with others.</p>
<h3>Record of People's Whereabouts</h3>
<p>Kong Xiangxi, Huang Shaoxiong, Chu Minyi, and Zou Lin all took the 11:00 PM special express train last night and returned to Beijing together.</p>
<h3>The Yuji Wheel Ran Aground on a Reef in Wenzhou Waters: The First and Second Holds Were Flooded by 15 Feet; All Crew and Passengers Were Safe</h3>
<p>The Yuji Wheel of the Shanghai Yuda Company ran aground on a reef on the 1st of this month while carrying goods from Yingkou, passing through Yantai, and going to Quanzhou and Xiamen to unload, and then to Fuzhou to load a large number of fruits to Shanghai. The ship loaded all the goods and passengers in Fuzhou on the 17th and set sail for Shanghai. It was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai this afternoon to unload, but it ran aground on a reef in the waters off Wenzhou, causing major damage to the ship's hull.</p>
<h3>The Donggua Mountain Touched a Submerged Reef</h3>
<p>The Yuji Wheel sailed from Fuzhou, and the weather was very good along the way. At about 12:00 AM that night, the ship arrived at the Donggua Mountain sea area in Wenzhou waters, at 120 degrees 57 minutes east longitude and 27 degrees 38 minutes north latitude. At that time, the wind was calm and the waves were gentle, and it should not have been an accident. However, it was heard that it was high tide that day, and the captain and first and second mates were all Japanese. Under the pressure of the tide, the Yuji Wheel went out of the navigation line and went to Donggua Mountain and ran aground on a submerged reef. The ship's hull was immediately broken.</p>
<h3>The Bottom of the First and Second Holds Cracked</h3>
<p>The first and second holds of the ship hit the reef first, so the bottom of the holds was immediately broken, and seawater poured in, flooding the holds to a depth of 15 feet. Fortunately, the engine room and the rear hold were not broken, avoiding a tragic sinking. It was a great fortune in misfortune. However, the front half of the ship's hull was affected by the flooding, and the ship's hull has already sunk, while the rear half has not been damaged. After the accident, the crew and passengers all gathered on the rear deck to take temporary refuge.</p>
<h3>The Ship Owner Sent a Telegram for Help</h3>
<p>After the accident, the ship owner, Japanese Abe Totaro, immediately sent a telegram to Shanghai for help. At 1:30 AM yesterday morning, the Shanghai company received the ship's alarm, which briefly stated that the ship was stranded on Donggua Reef in the waters off Wenzhou, and the crew and passengers were safe. The first and second holds have been flooded by 15 feet, and the engine room is well. After receiving the telegram, the company urgently discussed rescue plans. On the one hand, it notified the insurance company, and on the other hand, it telegraphed the Naval Headquarters to send warships to protect it to prevent accidents.</p>
<h3>Number of Passengers and Goods Loaded</h3>
<p>The ship was loaded with all fruits in Fujian, including oranges and olives, totaling 10,000 pieces, worth tens of thousands of yuan. A total of 110 passengers took the ship from Xiamen and Fujian to Shanghai. Now the goods in the first and second holds have been submerged in water, and the passengers on the ship gathered on the rear deck after the accident, waiting for the ship sent from Shanghai to rescue them. As of the time the reporter was writing, the company continued to receive the ship owner's third telegram, which still stated that the passengers were safe.</p>
<h3>Sending Ships to Rescue Passengers</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, the company had consulted with the local Jardine Matheson and hired a large tugboat to sail from Shanghai to the site of the Yuji accident in Donggua Mountain in Wenzhou waters to rescue the passengers on board, first transferring all of them to Shanghai, or still sending them to Fuzhou, which the passengers could decide for themselves temporarily. The company also contacted the Shanghai Chang'an Company, asking it to send personnel to go with the tugboat to handle the rescue of passengers, because the Yuda Company entrusted Chang'an to handle passenger affairs in Fuzhou. The Jardine Matheson tugboat had already set off from Shanghai last night at 7:00 PM and is expected to arrive at Donggua Mountain this afternoon.</p>
<h3>The Navy Sent Warships to Protect It</h3>
<p>The Yuda Company telegraphed the Naval Department, asking it to send warships to protect it, to prevent the accidental danger of the Yongxing Wheel being robbed by bandits last time. In the afternoon, it received a notice from the Naval Department that it had ordered the warship Chuguan and Jiangyuan to sail from Sanduao to the waters off Wenzhou for protection.</p>
<h3>The Amount of Ship Insurance</h3>
<p>The Yuji Wheel was originally a Norwegian ship built in 1901. The ship's hull is still good. The gross tonnage is 1,283 tons, and the net tonnage is 774 tons. It has 120,000 taels of peace marine insurance in the local Lianbao Insurance Company. After the accident yesterday, the company has forwarded the ship owner's telegram to the insurance company.</p>

<p>At 6:30 PM yesterday, a bizarre shooting occurred on Route Mère de Dieu in the Semi-Concession. The victim was Yu Chengbin, the cousin of Yu Huiguan, a Shanghainese woman who was killed on Wangzhi Road. He was shot once in the left chest and died on the spot. Details are recorded below:</p>
<h3>Brief Biography of Yu Chengbin</h3>
<p>Korean Yu Chengbin, 49 years old, had great ambitions. Grieved by the demise of his motherland, he engaged in the revolutionary movement at a young age. Decades ago, he fled to China alone and actively participated in the Korean independence movement. Due to the confidentiality of the matter, he was once arrested by the Japanese authorities in this city ten years ago and sent to Nagasaki, where he was sentenced to five years in prison. After being released, he returned to Shanghai. At that time, he was introduced by a friend and joined the Political Department of the French Concession Police as officer No. 54. He has been in this position for four years.</p>
<h3>Transferred to the Police as a Translator</h3>
<p>Since joining the police force, Jin has worked diligently and has been trusted by the police authorities.

<h3>Casual Talk at Yu's Friend's House</h3>
<p>At 6:00 PM yesterday, Yu left the police station after work and went to the home of his Korean friend, Jin Haishan, at No. 153 Route Mère de Dieu, for casual talk. Jin runs a Korean ginseng business and has a very good relationship with Yu. Yu often goes to Jin's place for a chat during his spare time, which has become a daily routine. Yu stayed for about an hour. At 6:45 PM, Yu said goodbye. Jin ordered his cousin, Kong Zhouxian, to send Yu out the back door. As soon as Yu reached the center of the street, a disaster suddenly struck.</p>
<h3>He Fell to the Ground When the Gun Sounded</h3>
<p>Jin's cousin, Kong Zhouxian, saw Yu out the back door and was about to close the door when he suddenly heard a gunshot. Knowing that something had happened, he turned around and appeared with Jin Haishan. But he saw Yu lying in a pool of blood. After asking him again and again, Yu could not speak. He gestured with his hand. Jin ran to report to the police station. The police chief heard the news and immediately sent a large number of patrolmen to investigate. He urgently used a car to send Yu to the Aurora Hospital on Jin Shenfu Road. After a doctor examined him, the bullet entered from the left chest and hit the heart. There was no way to save him. As expected, he died in less than half an hour.</p>
<h3>Family Members Wept Over the Body</h3>
<p>At the same time, Yu's family members heard the alarm and rushed to the hospital, but he had already died. The whole family wept over the body, and the scene was very tragic. It is heard that the deceased has not been naturalized in China, so the funeral will be presided over by the Japanese consulate. After hearing the news last night, the Japanese consul sent personnel to the French Concession Police to discuss solutions.</p>
<h3>Flour Millers Held a Representatives' Meeting Yesterday: Resolved to Request Exemption from Import Tax on Purchased Foreign Wheat; Organized a Petition Group to Go to Beijing to Petition the Ministry of Finance</h3>
<p>The Flour Millers' Association of this city, because of the Ministry of Finance's announcement that it would levy import taxes on foreign rice, wheat, and flour from the 16th of this month, requested that the foreign wheat purchased before the announcement be exempted from the tax. It had previously sent a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to forward to the central authorities, requesting exemption to alleviate the difficulties of merchants. So far, no approval from the Ministry of Finance has been received. Manufacturers from all over the country convened a joint meeting on the second floor of the Fuxin Flour Company on Jiangxi Road at 2:00 PM yesterday.</p>
<h3>Attending Representatives</h3>
<p>The representatives attending from various factories included Gu Xinyi, Chen Meisong, Zhu Yunchang, Fang Shanshen, Li Beitao, Sun Beihu, Bian Xiaoqing, Sun Zhongliang, Gu Yuxun, Wang Shixin, Fan Zhenlang, Zhou Huiyi, Pu Qiguan, Shi Fuhou, Wang Yinqiao, Jin Mingfu, Wang Yaochen, Zhou Yaxuan, Wang Yuqing, Lu Furen, Chen Ruqing, Zhao Xianzhi, Li Mengkun, and others, totaling 29 people. Gu Xinyi was elected as chairman.</p>
<h3>Chairman's Report</h3>
<p>After performing the ceremony, the chairman reported, saying that if the tax announced by the Ministry of Finance was the key to rescuing our country's bankrupt rural areas, it would be unknown. Because of the government's lack of wheat in our country, manufacturers had previously ordered a large amount of foreign wheat from foreign merchants. According to the current tax rate and surcharges after the implementation of the new tax, the losses would not be low. Because of this, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce was asked to forward a request to the central authorities to exempt the foreign wheat imported before the announcement. However, no reply has been received so far. Our colleagues should quickly find a way to save the situation.</p>
<h3>Resolutions</h3>
<p>After the report, the following resolutions were immediately discussed: (1) Organize a petition group to request the government to exempt the foreign wheat purchased before the announcement of the tariff from import tax to benefit manufacturers. (2) Elect Gu Xinyi, Sun Zhongli, Wang Yaochen, Shi Fuhou, Li Beitao, Sun Binnan, Bian Xiaoqing, Wang Shixin, Gu Yuxun, and other nine people as petition representatives. (3) Choose a date to go to Beijing to carry out the petition. The date will be decided by the nine representatives. The meeting adjourned at 6:00 PM.</p>
<h3>The Silk Market is Extremely Depressed; All Silk Factories Have Stopped Operating: The Number of Unemployed Workers Reaches 60,000; The Silk Workers' Union Petitions for Relief</h3>
<p>The Dagong News Agency reports that the country's silk industry is being affected by the dumping of Japanese silk in Europe and the United States, and overseas business is declining day by day. All 65 silk factories in this city have stopped operating. The number of unemployed workers has suddenly increased to more than 60,000. The workers' side has petitioned the local party and government organs, requesting them to forward the request to the central government for rapid relief. Details are as follows:</p>
<h3>All Factories Have Stopped Operating</h3>
<p>There are a total of 65 silk factories in the city. Recently, due to the sharp drop in silk prices, accumulated inventories, and the inability to maintain operations, more than 50 factories have stopped operating successively from September to November. There are still 11 factories that are struggling to operate normally. However, due to the slump in the silk market and huge losses, all 11 factories that were still operating have announced the closure of operations from this month. Only the Fulun Shuanggong Factory and Yongheng Silk Factory at the end of Tianbao Road in the Hongkou District are still struggling to operate, but they are afraid that it will be difficult to maintain it for long.</p>
<h3>The Workers' Side Regularly Petitions</h3>
<p>The Third, Fourth, and Sixth District Unions of the silk reeling industry in this city believe that various silk factories have been affected by the dumping of Japanese silk, prices have plummeted, making it difficult to maintain operations, and all factories have stopped operating. The number of unemployed workers has suddenly increased to more than 60,000, and their livelihoods are worrying. If this continues, it will have a great impact on social stability. Therefore, it was decided to unite with the representatives of the workers of various factories within days to petition the local party and government organs on a large scale, requesting them to forward the request to the central government for relief to maintain the livelihood of the workers.</p>
<h3>The First Batch of American Wheat Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday: Imported at 4:05 PM, with a Value of Approximately 600,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>The first batch of American wheat loan was delayed until yesterday afternoon due to fog encountered by the ship carrying it on the way. Details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Imported in the Afternoon</h3>
<p>The British ship "Alejandro Venk" loaded the first batch of American wheat and transported it to Shanghai, totaling 8,940 tons. It takes 24 days to arrive in Shanghai from the United States as usual. However, this time, the ship was delayed due to fog twice on the way, extending the voyage by six days, for a total of 29 days. It safely arrived at Wusong at 4:05 PM yesterday afternoon. It was dispatched to guide it into the Huangpu River, so it was after 5:30 PM when it arrived in Shanghai. It was originally scheduled to anchor at No. 16 River Pier, but because other ships were stopping there, it was changed to anchor at No. 4 River Pier.</p>
<h3>Today's Unloading</h3>
<p>The first batch of American wheat arrived in Shanghai, with a total value of over 600,000 yuan. It was imported by Fuxin and Fufeng companies, so the delivery method was changed to shipside delivery. Yesterday, the Cotton and Wheat Management Office issued a notice to the recipients, designating barges to the side of the ship, and the unloading will start today. The barges will load the cargo near the No. 4 river tube at the Gonghexiang Wharf and transport it to the warehouses of the flour mills along the Suzhou River, which is extremely convenient.</p>
<h3>Returning to America with Cargo</h3>
<p>The second batch of American wheat, 8,000 tons, has been loaded onto the "Alegen" vessel and is expected to arrive in Shanghai for delivery on Sunday or Monday of next week. After unloading its cargo, the "Alegen Fobeink" vessel will load export goods to America. The China Merchants Bureau has already secured the freight contract, and as soon as the wheat cargo is cleared, the vessel will be loaded for export. X X X X X X</p>
<h3>Guangdong Merchants and Cargo Carriers Refuse to Load Taikoo Ships – Grain Merchants Publicly Announce to Fellow Merchants via Telegram</h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Grain and Oil Cake Trade Association issued a public announcement to fellow merchants yesterday, stating, regarding the matter of the announcement, according to a letter from Shenshoutang, it has just received two telegrams from Guangzhou Hongyuantang, a fellow merchant, briefly stating, concerning the Taikoo ship's crew strike in Guangdong, our fellow merchants have suffered extremely heavy losses. Our association, together with the Guangzhou Chamber of Commerce, is negotiating with Taikoo for compensation. However, the Taikoo Seamen's Union and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce suddenly resolved the issue with Taikoo, leaving our merchants with a loss of over 500,000 yuan without any recourse. Now, we can only seek self-rescue urgently. Do not ship goods to any port on Taikoo ships. This concerns our lifeblood, and we must persist to the death. We will telegraph the whole country again to ask for their earnest assistance, hoping you will comply immediately, etc. Upon investigation, our association members have suffered losses of hundreds of thousands of yuan in the Taikoo seamen's strike in Guangdong. For the past month, Guangzhou Hongyuantang, together with the Chamber of Commerce, has been seeking compensation from Taikoo. Now, according to the telegram from that association, the losses are completely unaddressed, and we cannot but seek self-rescue urgently. Our association has resolved that all of our members, regardless of whether the goods are grains or not, whether shipping to Hong Kong or Guangdong, shall not load Taikoo ships. Even if it is someone else's goods, if they arrive at the port on Taikoo ships, our members shall not purchase them. It is recorded on file for special notification. I hope you will take note of this matter, etc., upon arrival at the association. We should reveal the situation based on the facts and hope that all fellow merchants will take note as one body. This is hereby announced.</p>
<h3>The Negotiation of the Case of Building Roads Beyond the Border: Both Parties Seek New Approaches – Continued Consultations are Extremely Smooth</h3>
<p>Regarding the Municipal Government's recovery of roads built beyond the border, since the Japanese made unreasonable demands for police power, negotiations were suspended due to the excessive distance, lasting for several months. In order to seek a swift resolution, both parties resumed consultations and sought new approaches. British Minister Sir Meyrick Hewlett also expressed his hope that the case would be resolved as soon as possible to the Municipal Government authorities and promised to expedite the process on behalf of the Public Works Department. As a result, both parties have been actively negotiating the case in recent days. A reporter from the Peace News Agency inquired about the progress from all parties yesterday. It is said that the negotiations between the two parties are extremely smooth and have made good progress compared to before. If they can continue to actively proceed according to the current situation, then the resolution of the entire case is very hopeful. It is heard that continued consultations will be needed within days to ensure everything is perfect.</p>
<h3>Northeastern Righteous Army – Zhu Fohai's Representative, Fan Cheng, Goes South</h3>
<p>Fan Cheng, the representative of Zhu Fohai, Commander-in-Chief of the Northeastern Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army, telegraphed the Shanghai Liaison Office yesterday. According to Councilor Lu Tiemin, Fan's trip south will involve negotiations with various important figures of the National Government. He is expected to come to Shanghai in about two weeks to investigate the truth of various liaison offices before going to Nanchang to meet Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and report everything.</p>
<h3>Representatives of the Shredded Tobacco Industry Petitioned Minister Kong Yesterday – Secretary Li Met on His Behalf and the Reply Was Extremely Satisfactory</h3>
<p>The Shredded Tobacco Trade Association, regarding the Tax Administration and Jiangsu Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Bureau's illegal and heavy taxation of shredded tobacco produced from Fujian native tobacco leaves within the special area of the seven provinces, the industry, recently overwhelmed, publicly appointed representatives Lu Yunwu, Lai Zhenhuan, Su Jichuan, and dozens of others yesterday afternoon to petition Minister Kong of the Ministry of Finance at his private residence on Route Gustaves de Saussine. As Minister Kong was out, there were no results. They then went to the Central Bank, where Secretary Li Nachuan met them. The representatives first stated their intentions and presented a petition. Then, each representative expressed their opinions. Secretary Li accepted the petition and promised to forward it to Minister Kong for review and decision. The reply was extremely satisfactory, etc. The full text of the petition is transcribed below.</p>
<h3>Purpose of the Petition</h3>
<p>To urge the prompt cessation of illegal and heavy taxation by the Tax Administration and Provincial Tax Bureau on tobacco shreds produced from Fujian native tobacco leaves within the special area of the seven provinces, so as to avoid disputes and alleviate the hardships of merchants.</p>
<h3>Past Events</h3>
<p>The Fujian tobacco shreds operated by our association members are mostly produced in Yongding, western Fujian. Due to geographical advantages, they are transported from Shantou or Xiamen. Since your department implemented the new regulations for the special tax on native tobacco leaves in the seven provinces, some businesses in Fujian have started to implement it (attached is a native tobacco leaf tax payment certificate). However, a portion of Yongding has not yet been implemented due to bandit suppression, so the old tobacco and alcohol tax is still collected as before. In September, the Tax Administration ordered that a special tax on native tobacco leaves be additionally paid for tobacco shreds imported into this area. After our association explained the situation and repeatedly explained, four temporary measures for additional tax payment and tax refund were established. At that time, our association thought the matter was temporary and reluctantly made additional payments. Unexpectedly, the Tax Administration became more aggressive. Recently, it suddenly changed its approach, citing the chaotic situation in Fujian due to political changes, and ordered that starting December 7 of this year, imported tobacco shreds must be treated as if they were transported from a non-special area to a special area, forcing heavy taxation of special taxes, completely overturning the previous four measures for tax payment and tax refund.</p>
<h3>Reasons for Ceasing</h3>
<p>Since Fujian Province has been clearly designated by your department as a special area of the seven provinces, it should be in accordance with Article 7 of the special tax collection regulations, which stipulates that tobacco shreds that have been shredded for smoking should be temporarily exempt from tobacco shred tax. To say that the political situation is chaotic is a local issue, and it is impossible to rashly change the major national tax regulations due to temporary local disputes. Moreover, our industry has been repeatedly affected by internal disturbances and attacked by the prevalence of foreign cigarettes from the outside. Besieged from both inside and outside, people are unable to live. If further layers of exploitation are added, then hundreds of thousands of disaster victims who rely on the meager domestic goods for a living will be helpless and will die. Based on the above reasons, we respectfully submit a brief summary as above, anxiously awaiting your instructions.</p>
<h3>Jin Xi's Family – Requested the French Concession Police Yesterday to Take Responsibility for Recovering Him – Jin is Still Detained in Shanghai, Whether He Will Be Sent to Japan is Uncertain – If the Japanese Consulate Continues to Delay, We Will Appeal to the International Community</h3>
<p>According to Eurasia News Agency, after the free police illegally arrested the Korean Jin Xi, who had already naturalized as a Chinese citizen, in the French Concession, various public organizations in this port and Jin's relatives believed that this matter was of great importance to our country's sovereignty. They unanimously requested the Municipal Government and the French Consul in Shanghai to seriously negotiate with the Japanese Consul to release him as soon as possible. As of now, the Japanese Consul has not given a concrete reply. Yesterday, a reporter from Eurasia News Agency heard from foreign sources that the Japanese Consul would send police to escort Jin Xi back to his country for trial within days. He specially visited Chen Yang and Li Shichang, relatives and friends of Jin, to inquire about everything. The details obtained are recorded as follows.</p>
<h3>Jin is Still Detained in Shanghai, but Deportation to Japan is Difficult to Avoid</h3>
<p>According to Jin's relatives and friends Chen and Li, Jin is still detained in this port. Because Mr. Cui knew of Jin's troubles and made a special delivery of his daily necessities, he saw Jin, whose face was haggard. However, the Japanese police were very strict in their surveillance and did not allow any conversation. However, according to Japanese law, the consulate's detention of a criminal must not exceed twenty-nine days. If he is not released after the deadline, he will be sent to his country for handling. Therefore, since Jin was arrested and detained on the 22nd of last month, we have been deeply concerned about his death. We have repeatedly requested the Chinese and French authorities to make efforts to rescue him, and we have received lawyers Lou Yunmei, Xu Jie, Luo Zhaoxin and other to telegram various public organizations, calling on them to fight together. Recently, we telegraphed Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to issue an order for negotiations, so that Jin Zhe could regain his freedom and escape danger as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Jin's Father Wrote to the French Concession Police Yesterday</h3>
<p>Jin Zhe's father, Jin Yongduo, sent a letter to the French Concession Police yesterday, requesting them to take responsibility for recovering him. The original letter stated, (omitted above) I and Yu Zhe naturalized as Chinese citizens as early as 1929, and executed a nationality permit, and have lived in the French Concession for many years. I recall that last year, my father and son were illegally arrested by the Japanese Consulate and severely interrogated. Their barbaric and vicious attitude still makes me shudder to think about it. It has not been long, and my son Jin Xi was arrested by your police force assisting the Japanese Consulate on November 22 of this year and transferred to the Japanese Consulate for illegal detention for more than two weeks. His life or death is unknown. Although I entrusted a representative to present the nationality permit and negotiate, your police force claimed that Jin Xi stated in the police station that he was of Mingxian nationality, which led to this misunderstanding, etc. I have been arrested and interrogated when my son and I transferred to Chinese nationality last year, and the Chinese and Western newspapers have also reported on it in detail. This time's arrest will not cause him to claim Korean nationality again, and it is undoubtedly your police force's attempt to deny responsibility. Now that I have submitted the nationality document, the facts of this matter have become clear, and the misunderstanding has been completely resolved. Your police force should be responsible for recovering him. I have made repeated requests, but you have repeatedly delayed. It is obviously deliberate trampling. According to the agreement on the establishment of Chinese courts in the French Concession of Shanghai, your police force should be responsible for the abuse of police power, and the loss of protection for residents of the concession thereafter is also not the true intention of your police force to protect. Since I live in the French Concession and Jin Xi's arrest was assisted by your police force, then in fact it proves that the innocent Jin Xi, who was arrested, should be responsible for recovering by your police force. I hereby submit a letter for your review and handling (omitted below).</p>
<h3>Final Appeal to International Arbitration</h3>
<p>According to Jin Xi's family representatives Chen Yang, Li Shichang, etc., they told the Eurasia News Agency reporter that the Japanese Consulate's illegal arrest of Jin Xi not only damaged our country's sovereignty, but also violated the Concession Agreement and international law. Although our government authorities have seriously negotiated, they still ignore it. If the Japanese Consul still disregards it, Jin's family will file a complaint with various countries to request international arbitration, hoping that our entire country will fight together to win the final victory and maintain the prestige of the country.</p>
<h3>Various Public Organizations Will Organize the Jin Society</h3>
<p>Chen also told the Eurasia News Agency reporter that Jin Xi has been arrested for twenty-seven days. There are many dangerous signs in the future. If we do not continue to make efforts to negotiate with the Japanese Consul, the problem of Jin Xi's release will not be optimistic. It is now heard that the Taxpayer's Chinese Association and other groups have proposed to organize a Jin Relief Committee. If this is true, our family will immediately participate and do our best to assist.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Communications Restricts the Business of Private Postal Bureaus – Implementing Additional Fees for Letters Exceeding Weight – Private Bureaus Petition to Retract the Order, but Were Not Granted – Postal Bureau Detains Unweighed Letters – Inland River Postal Bureaus Will Convene a Conference</h3>
<p>In order to restrict the business of domestic private postal bureaus, the Ministry of Communications previously announced five provisional measures for registered licenses. All private postal bureaus must obtain a license to operate. Starting last month, additional fees were implemented for letters exceeding weight. Because their business was at a dead end, all inland river private postal bureaus fought to abolish the fees, which resulted in the postal bureau detaining their letters. The details are recorded as follows.</p>
<h3>Collecting Overweight Fees from Private Postal Bureaus</h3>
<p>The private postal bureau business was founded during the Xianfeng era of the Qing Dynasty. Its business scope is divided into inland and outer river groups. The coastal areas and along the Yangtze River are the outer river private postal bureaus. The inland counties and towns of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces are called the inland river private postal bureaus. They specialize in sending letters and remittances for shops, individuals, and banks, etc., and their credibility is outstanding, so their business gradually expanded. It has a history of more than one hundred and thirty years. After the establishment of the state-run postal bureau, in order to restrict the operation of private postal bureaus, the outer river private postal bureaus were first charged an overweight fee. Initially, each pound of private postal mail paid 3.2 cents to the postal bureau, then increased to 6.4 cents. In 1913, it was changed to 9.6 cents per pound. In the last month of this year, it increased from 9.6 cents to 1.26 yuan. After the outer river private postal bureaus were strictly restricted, the private postal bureau business was virtually eliminated. They closed down one after another, and thousands of letter carriers and boatmen lost their jobs. Recently, the Ministry of Communications also implemented restrictions on inland river private postal bureaus. The first step was to announce measures for registered licenses. The second step was to similarly increase the overweight fee for letters, at 1.28 yuan per pound. Therefore, the inland river private postal bureaus had no profit to be made, and the public was extremely panicked.</p>
<h3>Postal Bureau Detains Private Postal Mail</h3>
<p>The inland river private postal bureaus believe that the Ministry of Communications' implementation of increased overweight fees for private postal mail will make it impossible to maintain business, and the crisis of bankruptcy and closure is imminent. Therefore, they insisted on unanimously refusing overweight fees and petitioned the Ministry of Communications to retract the order. At the same time, they sent representatives to the Postal Administration to petition and state their pain in order to maintain the livelihoods of tens of thousands of inland river postal bureau employees. However, the postal authorities were acting on orders from above and could not change them. Therefore, at the end of last month, the postal bureau dispatched personnel to cooperate with the local police to detain all the unweighed letters of the private postal bureaus in Zhabei, Nanshi.</p>
<h3>Petition to Exempt Weighing</h3>
<p>The representative of the private postal bureau submitted a document to the Ministry of Communications, stating, regarding the matter of the license having just been implemented, and weighing being difficult to comply with, please review the matter. I believe that my private postal industry is in a dead end today and is in its twilight years. The facts are obvious and known to the world. It is difficult to escape your keen insight. With tragic defeat and fragmentation, those who manage it are all old and mediocre, with no profession to change. In the autumn of collapsing agriculture, declining commerce, and dying industry, even those who are strong, intelligent, and capable still lack positions, let alone the disabled who change careers. Moreover, the postal development of Shanghai is progressing rapidly, and there is no place for the private postal industry to stand. After the Shanghai War, business is even more depressed, and various expenses have increased proportionally. It is truly precarious. However, since the registration license has been issued by your department, our industry can only accept it while enduring the pain. The license was obtained at the end of last month, and before ten days have passed, we will be ordered to weigh the letters. This is a talisman that will put our industry to death. In fact, business is getting lighter and lighter, and the remaining profits are getting smaller and smaller. It is truly a matter of a mere fly's head or the tip of an awl. We are already struggling to make ends meet. Now that we are depriving even this small amount, we can only sit and wait for death. Stopping business and changing professions are both unemployment. There are countless people, both directly and indirectly, who depend on this for a living in various ports. Why does your department begrudge even a small amount of grain in the granary to save the lives of these countless ants? Moreover, since the post office was established to this day, my private postal industry has fulfilled its obligations for forty years as if it was one day. Those who know the history of the post office can say it. Our industry does not dare to claim credit, but in recalling the hard work, your department should also leave this ray of hope to save and pity them. For this reason, we have fully stated the difficult situation and petitioned your department to examine and take pity on the hardship of being unable to maintain. We ask that the weighing of the letters be exempted. We are immensely grateful. Respectfully presented by Yin Yuantong, the general representative of the private postal bureau industry.</p>
<h3>The Postal Bureau Rejects the Petition</h3>
<p>The Postal Administration of the Ministry of Communications replied to the private postal bureau yesterday, stating, "The original petition was filed by Yin Yuantong, representative of the inland river private postal industry, regarding the stating the actual business situation of the inland river private postal bureau, and requesting an extension of the weighing period, and a reduction in postal fees. The Postal Administration has learned that all mail sent by private postal bureaus must be sealed as a general package and delivered by the post office in accordance with regulations, and postal fees must be paid according to the weight of the general package, which is much cheaper than affixing postage stamps on a per-item basis. The request for an extension of the weighing period and a reduction in postal fees should not be discussed." This approval was issued by Tang Baoshu, the acting director.</p>
<h3>Convening a General Assembly</h3>
<p>The inland river private postal bureaus in more than 100 counties in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, including Shanghai, Wuxi, Hangzhou, Suzhou, Kunshan, Quzhou, Jiaxing, Xiashi, Qingpu, etc., in view of the Ministry of Communications' gradual restriction of private postal business and the stipulation that the collection of mail will be completely stopped at the end of 1934, petitioned to retract the order but were not granted. In order to protect the 100-year-old business and maintain the livelihoods of thousands of employees, they decided to hold a general assembly in Shanghai in mid-March to discuss remedial measures.</p>

<h3>The Market is Depressed and Rents are High – The Citizens' Association Asks to Launch a Rent Reduction Campaign</h3>
<p>To alleviate the burden on citizens and maintain social stability, according to Ta Kung Pao, the 27th branch of the first special district of this city, because the number of bankrupt factories and shops in the recent depressed market is increasing every day, and the most threatening burden on citizens is the high cost of rent, submitted a petition to the Citizens' General Association yesterday, requesting that it lead the branch associations in various districts to jointly launch a rent reduction campaign in order to maintain social stability. The original text is recorded below: The purpose of this petition is to request that all district branch associations be ordered to engage in a rent reduction campaign to alleviate the burden on citizens. The economic panic has spread throughout the world, and the lives of the masses are becoming increasingly difficult. Taking Shanghai as an example, factory closures and store closures have been frequently heard of in recent years, and with the great changes of January 28, the market has become even more depressed. Therefore, the lives of the absolute majority of residents have reached the point where they cannot be maintained. Today, the high cost of rent is the greatest threat to the lives of citizens. Often, a small room costs several tens of yuan per month. Recently, all food, clothing, and daily necessities on the market have gradually decreased in price in response to social conditions. Only the housing problem, which is indispensable to the lives of citizens, remains as expensive as before, and newly built houses are even more expensive. In this depressed society, how can the majority of residents bear it? I believe that the organization of the Citizens' Association is for the benefit of the citizens, and it is its duty to pay serious attention to the housing price problem, which is a great threat to the lives of citizens, and to vigorously carry out a rent reduction campaign to reduce the burden on citizens and maintain social stability. It is requested that your association quickly order all district branch associations to unanimously devote themselves to this urgent work, pooling their efforts to achieve it. The citizens are fortunate. Respectfully presented by the Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Association.</p>
<h3>Cao Zilai Invented a New Type of Diving Suit – Cao is a Native of Nantong, Studied it After Witnessing a Sunken Ship – The Manufacturing Design Has Been Submitted to the Research Institute for Testing</h3>
<p>Cao Zilai, a native of Nantong, recently invented a new type of diving suit. A few days ago, he specifically brought the manufacturing design to Beijing to request material assistance from the Navy, Army, and Ministry of Communications in order to achieve success. It is learned that Mr. Cao has completed his affairs and returned to his hometown via Shanghai. A reporter from Ta Tung News Agency, who is currently staying at the Huishang Hotel, specially visited Mr. Cao yesterday to inquire about everything. Mr. Cao was out at the time. According to a fellow villager, Mr. Cao is teaching at a school in Chongming. He witnessed the sinking of the Da Yun merchant ship near the Baochen port. The company attempted to salvage it twice, but both times failed, resulting in a loss of 20,000 yuan. This prompted him to study it and invent eleven methods for salvaging sunken ships: (1) Buoy Method, (2) Submarine Method, (3) Semi-Submarine Method, (4) Sub-Diving Method, (5) Floating Tide Method, (6) High Tide Floating Method, (7) Semi-Submerged Floating Method, (8) Pulley Method, (9) Cabin Sealing Method, (10) Cabin Sealing Buoy Method, (11) Pulling Away Method. In addition to the salvage methods, he also invented a new diving suit as an auxiliary tool for salvage. The method uses two layers of high-quality native cloth from Tongzhou, coated with rubber in the middle, equipped with rubber bands, copper frames, glass, screws, air tubes, etc., so that one can open their eyes to see in the water without leaking water. The mouth and nose are equipped with two air tubes of different sizes for floating and sinking and absorbing air. The feet are attached with lead-bottomed cloth shoes, weighing ten pounds. The shoes also contain copper towns that can be freely increased or decreased. The inside of the clothing is made with a zinc-copper outer cage to protect the head and neck. In the future, gradual improvements will be made and telephone mechanisms will be installed to communicate with the shore. Through this research, it may be possible to open up another source of human life in the water world. The design and manufacturing method have now been submitted to the Central Research Institute for testing.</p>
<h3>Robbing Rent and Injuring the Gatekeeper – The Gatekeeper Was Injured and Bravely Resisted the Robber – One Robber Was Caught and the Rent Was Not Robbed</h3>
<p>The houses in You Deli, Tokyo Road, Putuo Road, West Shanghai, are leased by attorney Che Bingrong. On the 2nd and 17th of each month, rental collectors are sent to collect rent. On the 17th of the day before yesterday, at 2 pm, attorney Che sent rental collector Fang Wengui to You Deli as usual, accompanied by gatekeeper Shi Lansheng, to collect rent from door to door. They first collected 294 yuan in cash, put it in a cloth bag, and carried it by Shi to No. 35 You Deli to count the cash. As soon as they entered the house, two robbers suddenly followed them in. One robber pulled out an axe and chopped Shi several times, causing injuries to his head, face, fingers, and other parts. The robber also tried to rob the cloth bag, but Shi managed to grab the axe while shouting for help. Tao Jinsheng, who lived at No. 18, was playing in the alley at the time and heard the alarm. He entered the room to help arrest the assailant.</p>
<h3>Ma Chongxian Suspected of Reactionary Activities</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Second Branch of the High Court secretly interrogated Ma Chongxian, whose courtesy name is Shaopu, a staff officer of Xie Gangzhe's Northeast Fleet, and forbade public attendance. The result of the interrogation was that the Municipal Public Security Bureau was allowed to transfer him. Ma had come to Shanghai this time and was staying in Room 41 of the Far East Hotel on Beihai Road. It was said that his mission was to contact the Haiqi, Haishen, and Zhaoche three ships of the fleet that had previously acted independently and bring them back to the team. However, the municipal authorities, having learned that Ma still had reactionary intentions, ordered detectives to cooperate with the Public Concession Police to arrest Ma and bring him to the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court. The court approved a bail of 1,000 yuan for him to be released pending trial, as previously reported. Yesterday morning, Yu Ye, the head of the Criminal Division of the Second Branch of the High Court, together with Judges Jiang and Zhou, held a session to continue the trial. Ma Chongxian, accompanied by his defense lawyer Fan Gang, arrived to be questioned. Judge Yu, considering the case related to politics, announced that public attendance was prohibited. He then questioned Ma Chongxian for a long time, but the content was unknown. After the interrogation, the debate began. First, Ma's lawyer, Fan Gang, spoke, generally arguing that the defendant had no reactionary behavior and requested that he not be transferred. Next, Zhan Jifeng, the legal advisor of the Public Security Bureau, stated that the defendant, taking advantage of the unrest of the times, secretly reported the actions of the warships stationed by the Central Government outside Wusongkou to other parties, leaking military secrets and seriously suspected of acting outside the bounds. Even if he had not committed any crime, as a soldier, he should know that obedience to orders is the only duty of a soldier. Since the Central Government wanted the defendant to go to explain and report on the intention of the warships' actions, he should immediately respond to the call and go. The fact that the defendant wanted to resist the order by relying on the concession showed that he was afraid of his crime and was indeed guilty. He requested the court to rule that the defendant be handed over to the Public Security Bureau to be taken back and transferred to the Central Government for interrogation. Li Zhishan, the lawyer representing the工部局 Municipal Council, also stated that he had no objection to the transfer. Judge Yu then ruled in court that Ma Chongxian should be handed over to the Public Security Bureau to be taken away for interrogation, and his bail money should be returned and the bond canceled. Upon hearing the ruling, Ma said that he was a current official and requested that the Public Security Bureau be notified to give him better treatment. Judge Yu approved the request and instructed lawyer Zhan to inform Director Wen of the Bureau of the defendant's wishes. Then, detectives took Ma out of the court and took him to the Public Security Bureau.</p>
<p>One thief was caught, but the other thief escaped through the back door. The case was reported to the Putuo Road Police Station, which dispatched Chinese Detective Huang Yongji, Inspector Bao Deshou, and Detective Bao Yang Chengjie to bring the captured thief, along with a hatchet and a bag of silver dollars, to the police station. After questioning, the thief was identified as Ke Guisheng from Hubei. His accomplice was named Li Shugen. He was ordered to be detained, and the injured Shi Lansheng was sent to the hospital for treatment. Yesterday morning, the case was sent to the First Special District Court. Wang Yaotang, the police lawyer, stated the case, saying that the defendant was being prosecuted under Article 348 of the Criminal Law and requested an extension to arrest his accomplice. According to Shi Lansheng's complaint, after receiving the rent yesterday, he went home to count it. The defendant followed him in, took out a hatchet, and attacked him, trying to rob the bag. He resisted with all his might, seized the axe, and shouted for help. Tao Jinsheng arrived and helped arrest him. His head and face were also injured by the hatchet. He only saw the defendant alone. Tao Jinsheng also testified about the circumstances of the arrest. The defendant Ke Guisheng confessed that Li Shugen had lived with the plaintiff and knew that the 2nd and 17th of each month were the dates for collecting rent. One afternoon, at the entrance of the Fuxin Flour Mill No. 8 on Moshi Mountain Road, he discussed with him the intention to rob Shi. It was agreed that they would meet at Li's house yesterday afternoon. Li first struck Shi on the head with an iron rod and handed him a hatchet. Shi was injured and screaming, so he held him down while Li escaped through the back door. After reviewing the confessions, Judge Wu Tingqi ordered the defendant to be detained for a rescheduled hearing next Friday. The stolen silver dollars were returned in advance.</p>

<h3>Ma Chongxian Suspected of Reactionary Activities 丨丨 The Second Branch of the High Court Secretly Interrogated Him Yesterday and Forbade Public Attendance 丨丨 The Result of the Interrogation Was That the Municipal Public Security Bureau Was Allowed to Transfer Him 丨丨</h3>
<p>Ma Chongxian, whose courtesy name is Shaopu, a staff officer of Xie Gangzhe's Northeast Fleet, came to Shanghai this time and was staying in Room 41 of the Beihai Road</p>
<p>Far East Hotel. It was said that his mission was to contact the Haiqi, Haishen,</p>
<p>Zhaohe three ships of the fleet that had previously acted independently and bring them back to the team. However, the municipal authorities, having learned that Ma still had reactionary intentions, ordered skilled</p>
<p>detectives to cooperate with the Public Concession Police to arrest Ma and bring him to the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court. The court approved a bail of 1,000</p>
<p>yuan for him to be released pending trial, as previously reported. Yesterday morning, Yu Ye, the head of the Criminal Division of the Second Branch of the High Court, together with Judges Jiang and Zhou</p>
<p>held a session to continue the trial. Ma Chongxian, accompanied by his defense lawyer Fan Gang, arrived to be questioned. Judge Yu, considering the case related to politics</p>
<p>declared that public attendance was prohibited. He then questioned Ma Chongxian for a long time, but the content was unknown. After the interrogation, the debate began.</p>
<p>First, Ma's lawyer, Fan Gang, spoke, generally arguing that the defendant had no reactionary behavior and requested that he not be transferred. Next, the Public</p>
<p>Security Bureau's legal advisor, Zhan Jifeng, stated that the defendant, taking advantage of the unrest of the times, secretly reported the actions of the warships stationed by the Central</p>
<p>Government outside Wusongkou to other parties, leaking military secrets and seriously suspected of acting outside the bounds.</p>
<p>Even if he had not committed any crime, as a soldier, he should know that obedience to orders is the only duty of a soldier. Now that the Central Government wants the defendant to go to explain and report on the intentions of the warships' actions, he should immediately respond to the call and go.</p>
<p>The fact that the defendant wants to resist the order by relying on the concession shows that he is afraid of his crime and is indeed guilty. He requested the court to rule that the defendant be handed over to the Public Security Bureau to be taken back and transferred to the Central Government for interrogation. The lawyer representing the工部局 Municipal Council, Li Zhishan, also stated that he had no objection to the transfer. Judge Yu then ruled in court that Ma Chongxian</p>
<p>should be handed over to the Public Security Bureau to be taken away for interrogation, and his bail money should be returned and the bond canceled. Upon hearing the ruling, Ma said that he was a current official and requested that the Public Security Bureau be notified to give him better treatment. Judge Yu approved the request and instructed lawyer Zhan to inform Director Wen of the Bureau of the defendant's wishes.

<h3>Communist Criminal He Long's Wife and Others Sentenced - The Defendants All Refuse to Accept and Must Appeal -</h3>
<p>Ma Shaowu, also known as Lv Keqin, the late inspector of the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau, learned in April of this year that Wang Xiangshi, also known as Xiang Yuangu, a woman from Hunan living in the Mei Rui Li on Jiaxini Road in the French Concession, was the wife of He Long, the commander of the Communist Red Army, and was secretly dispatched by He to Shanghai to manage the economic responsibilities of the Communist Party in Shanghai. He reported this to the political department of the French Police Station and requested assistance in arresting and extraditing her for interrogation. The political director dispatched Chinese and Western detectives to arrest her at the address and seized five people, including Xiang and men Wang Wenmin, Wang Ruiqing, Xiong Yuwu, and Xiong Kanwen, all from Hunan. They also seized Xiang's gold seal and bank deposit slips and took them back to the police station to be transferred to the Third Branch of the Jiangsu High Court for questioning. The defendants hired lawyers such as Shi Liang, Wang Shizong, and Tang Hao to defend them, saying that Xiang was indeed He's concubine before, but had broken off relations and remarried to a Wang, etc. While the case was under trial, a woman from Hunan, Zhu Huiwu, visited the defendants at the court and sent food. The detective saw it and, fearing that Zhu was a member of the same party and also suspected of committing a crime, she was arrested and tried together. Later, after investigation by the police station, as the defendants had no direct evidence of committing crimes in Shanghai, they opposed the Public Security Bureau's request for transfer. The Third Branch of the High Court ruled that the transfer was not allowed, and the case was accepted and tried by this court. The political department of the French Police Station filed a public prosecution in accordance with the Emergency Law for Punishing Crimes Endangering the Republic of China, as briefly reported previously. The High Court transferred the case to the Hunan Provincial Government for investigation. According to the reply, except for Xiong Kanwen and Zhu Huiwu among the defendants, the rest participated in reactionary work in Hunan. Wang</p>
<p>Wenmin, also known as He Ganchen, is He Long's brother, etc. After several court hearings and final statements, at 3:00 pm yesterday, Judge Guo, accompanied by Judges Fan and Sun and Prosecutor Zhang, held a court session and sentenced them. The charges were endangering the Republic of China, disturbing public order, or organizing groups, etc. Wang Xiangshi and Wang Wenmin were sentenced to twelve years of imprisonment and deprivation of public rights for life. Xiong Yuwu was sentenced to eight years of imprisonment and deprivation of public rights for ten years. Wang Ruiqing was sentenced to two and a half years of imprisonment. Xiong Kanwen and Zhu Huiwu were found not guilty. After the sentencing, the guilty defendants were transferred to the detention center. Xiong Kanwen and Zhu Huiwu, who were not guilty, were granted bail of 600 yuan each by the court pending appeal. It is reported that the defendants all intend to appeal.</p>

<h3>Di Yang Brand Woolen Yarn is Verified to be a Genuine Domestic Product - The National Goods Promotion Association Notifies All Sectors to Sell and Use It</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Citizens' National Goods Promotion Association previously received a letter from the Consumption Cooperative of the Bank of China asking whether the newly sold Di Yang brand woolen yarn in Shanghai was a domestic product. In order to clarify the truth, the association decided to send letters to the Tianjin Chamber of Commerce, the place of origin of the product, and Wang Wendian and Zhou Yongze, members of the Nanyang Tobacco Company and Shengxifu Hat Factory stationed in Tianjin, to investigate and reply for verification. Soon, the Tianjin Chamber of Commerce and others replied separately, confirming that it was a domestic product and providing responsible proof. The 14th second joint meeting of the executive supervisors of the association decided to reply to the society based on the situation and notify all members and send letters to public groups across the country, requesting them to promote and adopt it. The original letter is recorded as follows: (Above omitted) The case investigates your society's letter, which is for the Di Yang brand woolen yarn produced by the Dongya Woolen Textile Company. It is rumored that it is a shoddy product pretending to be a foreign product, and it is imported by a certain large bank in their country. Please investigate and reply so that we can make a decision. We sent letters to the Tianjin Chamber of Commerce, members of the association, Wang Wendian, the representative of Nanyang Tobacco Company stationed in Tianjin, and Zhou Yongze, the representative of Shengxifu Hat Factory, to investigate and reply in detail. The two representatives of the members replied successively, stating that the company is located at No. 15 Road, Tianjin Yi Concession, covering an area of 20 mu, with a capital of 800,000 yuan. It was founded by patriotic youths Lu Shang Song Feiqing, Song Xiafei, Zhao Zizhen, Song Xianyong, and Zhao Shuzhen. The capital and manpower have no foreign relations. Most of the raw materials are also made of domestic wool. It spins more than 4,000 pounds of four-strand wool yarn day and night. The products are excellent and can resist all foreign goods such as Honeybee Bachelor and Sparrow. It is the most complete woolen factory among Chinese merchants. Checking the various evidence preparation books is very clear, and there are no traces of dealings with foreign merchants. The knowledge and evidence show that it is a pure domestic product without any doubt. All kinds of rumors circulating in Shanghai are completely inconsistent with the facts. They are willing to be responsible for proving and recommend joining your association to hope to support and dispel rumors. They also attached a product investigation form and 13 pieces of various evidence to the meeting. The 14th second joint meeting of the executive supervisors of the association decided that the products of the company have been investigated and replied by the Tianjin Chamber of Commerce and members of the association and are confirmed to be domestic products. After reviewing the various evidence, they are all consistent. We should reply to the Consumption Cooperative of the Bank of China to promote sales and allow them to join the association as a factory member. According to the actual standard of domestic goods, it is proved that it is a second-class domestic product and should be reported to members and sent to public groups and people across the country to unanimously promote sales to maintain domestic goods. The records are kept on file. In addition to complying with the discussion and handling them separately, the corresponding reply hopes to be checked for compliance (below omitted)</p>

<h3>Shanghai Goat Milk Company has Excellent Quality - Health Authorities Translate it as Exceeding Standards</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Goat Milk Company was founded by health experts, well-known veterinarians, and industrialists in Shanghai. Since its preparation, it has been in business for eight months. In order to strive for complete equipment and excellent products, the founders did not rush to sell milk. It has recently been heard that it has started business since last month. The goat milk produced by the company has been tested by the Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau and the Boundary Health Office. The results show that it is not only qualified but also exceeds the standard. It is known that the milk quality is pure, nourishing, and hygienic. Goat milk is not only rich in fat and protein, but also contains abundant vitamins and does not contain tuberculosis bacteria. It is the best nourishing beverage in modern times. Therefore, since the company started operations, purchasers have been flocking to it, and there is a great demand for it. In order to meet the needs of the society, the company has continued to purchase a large number of high-quality dairy goats from Switzerland, which have recently arrived. However, those who have fixed orders are still constantly ordering, and it is feared that they will not be able to allocate the milk. Therefore, the company plans to order more dairy goats from Switzerland to avoid the feeling of regret for those who have fixed orders. The company's concession office is now located at No. 15 Museum Road, with telephone number 11454.</p>
<h3>A WOMAN HAS TWO PARAMOURS RESULTING IN TRAGEDY</h3>
<p>Chen Ziwen, a worker at the Huasheng Silk Weaving Factory on Ximen Xieqiao Road, aged 29, from Hangzhou, had been having an affair with his fellow townsman, Madam Shang Chen, for over three years. Recently, she also became romantically involved with his friend, Luo Jiafu, aged 38. Luo worked as a worker at the Fulilai Silk Weaving Factory at No. 7 Sanxingfang, Tangshan Road, also from Hangzhou. Madam Shang Chen cohabited with Luo at No. 20 near the factory.

Another worker, Chen Jiaokui, dashed out to report to the nearby police stations No. 2023 and No. 1284. Two Chinese constables arrived and arrested Chen, bringing him and the axe to the Huishan Police Station. The head constable ordered him to be detained. He also dispatched Detective Huang Fugen to take the injured Madam Shang Chen and Luo Jiafu to Guangren Tongren Hospital for treatment. Yesterday morning, the police station escorted the suspect Chen to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District.

Luo Jiafu had suffered minor injuries and was present for questioning. The murder weapon was presented for inspection and the case was adjourned for further investigation. Luo Jiafu continued, stating that he had known the defendant for many years and that he had brought him to Shanghai from their hometown to work in the silk factory. He had no relationship with Madam Shang Chen. Jiang Hualin and Lu Jiaokui also testified to what had happened. When questioned, the defendant confessed that he had been having an affair with Madam Shang Chen for a long time and that Luo Jiafu should not have taken his mistress, so he was angry and injured them with an axe. He asked for leniency. Judge Xiao Xiefei ordered him to be remanded in custody, pending another hearing after Madam Shang Chen's recovery.</p>

<h3>SHIPPING ASSOCIATION NOTIFIES MEMBERS TO SEEK OPINIONS ON PARTICIPATING IN JOINT TRANSPORTATION, TOTALING SIX ITEMS, REPLY REQUESTED WITHIN FIVE DAYS</h3>
<p>The case of privately-owned shipping companies striving to participate in water and land joint transportation was decided by the Ministry of Communications and the Ministry of Railways. The authorities were instructed to handle it according to the decision. The Shipping Association notified its members yesterday, seeking their opinions, and requested a report within five days. It was decided to telegraph the Ministry again to request a change of method. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>MINISTRY OF RAILWAYS APPROVAL</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Railways approved the petition of Yu Hede, Chairman of the Shipping Association, saying that it presented a petition and a telegram, pleading for the private shipping industry to participate in sea-land combined transport, in order to give equal treatment and relieve business difficulties. The petition No. 81 and the telegram of October were fully understood. The purpose of the state-owned railway to create sea-land combined transport is to develop transport and facilitate passengers and merchants. There is no prejudice against whether the shipping industry is state-owned or private-owned. However, at the beginning of the creation, the clues were intricate, so we had to adopt a gradual approach to lay the foundation. In order to allow private shipping companies to participate in the combined relocation, the Ministry has jointly with the Ministry of Communications formulated the following measures for private shipping companies to participate in sea-land combined transport: (1) Chinese private and state-owned shipping companies may participate in sea-land combined relocation, but only those who have been operating on various routes on a regular basis since November 22 and have their own wharves and warehouses. (2) Private shipping companies that intend to participate in sea-land combined transport must first apply to the Ministry of Communications and the Ministry of Railways for approval. (3) Each shipping company participating in sea-land combined transport shall set up a joint office for sea-land combined transport, and its expenses shall be shared proportionally according to the tonnage of combined transport goods loaded by each company. (4) The distribution of combined transport goods shall be based on the proportion of the current regular ships of each company, but this shall not apply if the equipment is inadequate and passengers and merchants are unwilling to report for transport. (5) Each shipping company participating in combined transport shall abide by the contract operating rules separately signed by the Railway Ministry's Combined Transport Department and the various Railway Bureaus with the state-owned China Merchants Bureau. (6) Before the establishment of the joint office of the private and state-owned shipping companies, the contract and operating rules separately signed by the Railway Ministry's Combined Transport Department and the various Railway Bureaus with the China Merchants Bureau shall be implemented as scheduled. In the future, all shipping companies intending to join the railway sea-land combined transport may handle the matter according to the above-mentioned measures. In addition, the case of China United Shipping Company and Shanghai Dazhen Shipping Company applying to participate in sea-land combined transport is the same and should be merged into an order to comply with and inform them. This approval, Minister Gu Mengyu.</p>

<h3>ASSOCIATION NOTIFICATION</h3>
<p>The Shipping Association issued a notice yesterday, saying, "Dear Sirs, regarding the case of private shipping companies requesting to directly and simultaneously undertake sea-land combined transport, this association and Chairman Yu have separately and repeatedly asked the authorities to appeal. Yesterday, we received Approval No. 2700 from the Ministry of Communications and Approval No. 1435 from the Ministry of Railways, which opened six items of agreed measures, allowing private shipping companies to participate simultaneously, etc. Now, the approval and meeting minutes of the two ministries are copied and sent for your review. This association submitted this case to the twentieth executive committee meeting for discussion yesterday. According to the principle of the measures discussed by the two ministries, only those who have been operating on various routes on a regular basis since November of this year and have their own wharves and warehouses are allowed to participate. Therefore, although private participation is allowed, it is still strictly restricted. It is found that only a small number of private companies meet this qualification in terms of the number of companies, and it is still not a public and equal distribution method. The association should telegraph the two ministries again, revealing two points: (1) Only those who can regularly operate on each route shall be the standard; (2) Companies that are willing to undertake combined transport, if wharves and warehouses are indeed necessary, can add them and should not be limited to those who have already set them up. Please change it." At the same time, opinions are solicited from various companies by sending letters for the following items, A) Are you willing to participate in sea-land combined transport, (B) If you are willing to participate in sea-land combined transport, which route are you determined to operate on a regular basis, (C) If you are determined to operate on a regular basis on a certain route, how many ships are you willing to add to the joint office for joint transport, (D) Are you willing to share the expenses of the combined transport office proportionally according to the tonnage of goods loaded in accordance with the third item of the ministerial meeting, (E) If the determined route needs to add wharves and warehouses, are you willing to bear the construction costs and recurring costs of the ships carrying goods and combined transport goods on the route on a per-ship basis, (F) If the designated ship carries combined transport goods, can it bear full responsibility for all compensation for the goods, and the guarantee of responsibility, please ask each company to reply to this association in writing and be responsible for each item within five days, and then convene all companies willing to participate to discuss other detailed measures in public before presenting them to the ministry for participation. It is found that your company cannot meet the qualifications of the first item of the ministry's decision-making measures, but this association has the ambition to unite the industry, so in addition to requesting the two ministries to change the restrictions, it is urgent to follow the resolutions made by the executive committee and send a special letter to you. We hope that your company will reply to the association in writing and be responsible for each of the six items of A, B, C, D, E, and F within five days of receiving the letter. The matter is important, please do not delay it. If no reply is received, it will be regarded as unwillingness to participate, and please pay attention to it."</p>
<h3>MUGEN ROAD CARGO STATION LOADING AND UNLOADING WORKERS ELECT FOREMEN XU DEYOU AND SONG KAIXIANG ARE ELECTED AND PLAN TO ESTABLISH A WORKERS' OFFICE</h3>
<p>The loading and unloading workers at Mugen Road Cargo Station were originally scheduled to register first from August 13th to 15th, and then elect a chief foreman to organize an office. At that time, the workers did not register, and the case was suspended for a long time. On November 25th, the loading and unloading workers at the station voluntarily submitted a petition to the bureau, willing to abide by the temporary regulations of the Mugen Luo Cargo Station Loading and Unloading Workers' Office stipulated by the Central Party Headquarters and the Ministry of Railways. The Railway Bureau replied on the 4th of this month, requesting that the former Railway Ministry and the Central Party Headquarters send personnel to guide them. On the 7th of this month, the Mass Movement Guidance Committee of the Central Party Headquarters sent Director-General Li Renzhu, and the Ministry of Railways sent commissioners Yang Ge and Committee Member Guo Zhongxing to Shanghai to supervise the bureau's Deputy Director Yuan Bohou of the General Affairs Department and Director Zheng Bao of the Vehicle Affairs Department to handle the registration of workers on the 9th and 10th of this month. The election was officially held on the 12th. In addition to the special commissioners of the Central Party Headquarters and the Railway Ministry, representatives of the two-way party headquarters Cheng Shi, Zou Zhengjian, and Chen Pin, and the two-way trade unions Luo Tinghan and Han Dejun were also present.

The chairman, in accordance with the election rules, designated Yu Jun贵 and Chen Wenlun, as ticket writers, and Mei Jiahe and Peng Zhaokai as ballot counters from the fifteen foremen of the loading and unloading workers at the station. Subsequently, under the supervision of representatives of various agencies, the votes were opened. As a result, Xu Deyou and Song Kaixiang were elected as chief foremen with 513 votes each. Once the Railway Bureau approves the record, the office will be officially established and negotiate a contract with the Vehicle Affairs Department, it is said.</p>

<h3>Being Different by Yongzi</h3>
<p>---</p>
<p>The latest styles are naturally popular. But, "retro" styles also receive praise. "New" and "old" are simply products of different eras; we don't need to be alarmed or consider it illogical, because "latest styles" and "retro" styles contain a molecule of equal quality: "being different."</p>
<p>In a large group of ladies and girls wearing qipaos, one or two who wear a coat or shawl that no one else is wearing over their qipao will undoubtedly be praised for being the most fashionable. But in the same group, if one or two wear a skirt and top in a traditional style, they can still be admired for their graceful movements. Similarly, in this trend of women cutting their hair, perming it into a poodle style is the "latest," but some ladies who have already cut their hair are growing it long again and styling it into a bun, which can also be quite charming.</p>
<p>Therefore, those who are used to eating home-cooked meals every day find it quite a treat when they occasionally receive a red invitation card, give a two-yuan gift, and enjoy a lavish feast of shark fin and sea cucumber. However, at the end of the month when money is tight, going to the public stove for three sesame cakes and a pot of hot water can also make the sesame cakes seem fragrant and the hot water seem sweet. While this is not "latest styles" or "retro," it is still a form of "being different." In modern literature, authors who can insert a few lines of original text from Western masterpieces into their articles are qualified to be called authorities in the literary world. However, those who can write classical poetry and prose can also be respected as experts. Only those who are bound by "new" and "old," speaking common platitudes and following the crowd, will only live an ordinary life.</p>
<p>In a metropolis, laying the foundation for an 18-story building in the 1934 style can attract noble gentlemen and ladies to attend the grand ceremony. But in the same city, when an 18th-century palace-style building is unveiled, it can also attract a large crowd. The reason is that "1934 style" and "18th-century palace style" are both "different." Understanding this allows people to know which path they should take.</p>
<h3>On Titles by Shi Geng</h3>
<p>Everyone knows that our Great China is an ancient civilization and a land of etiquette and righteousness, and the "Three Bonds and Five Constant Virtues" are especially the "national essence" that our ancient country has revered for thousands of years as divine principles. Look at how clearly our country distinguishes the relationships and titles between relatives. Anyone who has read "Epistolary Manuals" should know this well. As for the foreign devils, after all, they are "barbarians," and they generally don't value "human relations" very much. For example, "paternal aunt," "paternal uncle's wife," "paternal aunt," "maternal aunt," and "maternal aunt" are all called "Aunt" in English and "Tante" in French. "Paternal uncle," "paternal uncle," "paternal aunt's husband," "maternal uncle," and "maternal uncle's wife" are all called "Uncle" in English and "Oncle" in French. This is really not as clear as our Chinese characters.</p>
<p>However, there are also many ambiguous titles in Chinese characters. For example, the character "姨" (yí, aunt) has many usages: a nephew calls his mother's sister "姨母" (yímǔ, maternal aunt), a sister's husband calls his wife's sister "内姨" (nèiyí, inner aunt), people generally call a concubine "姨太太" (yítàitài, concubine), prostitutes call a madam "姨娘" (yíniáng, auntie), and masters call female servants "娘姨" (niángyí, nanny).</p>
<p>Also, "brothers and sisters" is almost universally applicable in daily interactions. Even if they are two strangers who have never met before, after meeting once or twice, they immediately become "仁兄" (rénxiōng, benevolent brother). In terms of the opposite sex, initially, of course, it's "先生" (xiānshēng, Mr.) and "女士" (nǚshì, Ms.), but at a certain point, it can jump to "哥哥" (gēgē, older brother) and "妹妹" (mèimei, younger sister). In this trend of "all within the four seas are brothers," there must be some distinction between one's own brothers and sisters and the other "compatriots," so the titles "胞兄" (bāoxiōng, full older brother), "胞弟" (bāodì, full younger brother), "胞姊" (bāozǐ, full older sister), and "胞妹" (bāomèi, full younger sister) were created.</p>
<p>Some people, for the sake of "rationalizing titles," advocate using legal terms, such as "direct ascendants," "collateral ascendants," "first degree of kinship," "second degree of kinship," etc., but I'm afraid that this kind of "mixing and unifying" titles is not suitable for the national character of our ancient civilization, right?</p>
<h3>Hometown Wild Vegetables by Ms. Wang Ju</h3>
<p>Speaking of the wild vegetables of Eastern Zhejiang, I'm afraid everyone already knows about them! The reason is that Mr. Zhou Qiming mentioned them in "Rainy Day Book." Mr. Qiming is a great modern essayist, and even a humble weed seems to have its value increased tenfold after being appraised by him.</p>
<p>The most common wild vegetables are alfalfa and purple clover.</p>
<p>Both are sown in the fields for fertilizer and can also be eaten. Mr. Qiming has already mentioned this, so I won't repeat it. But Mr. Qiming seems to treat alfalfa and purple clover as the same, but they are actually not. Now, I will talk about their differences based on what I know.</p>
<p>Alfalfa is called "草头" (cǎotóu) in the Shanghai dialect. The flowers are small like osmanthus, and the color is inexplicably melancholic. It is also called "金花菜" (jīnhuācài, golden flower vegetable), which is wild alfalfa. The leaves are composed of three obovate leaflets, and the pods are spiral-shaped and have thorns. It is said that there is alfalfa with purple flowers in the north, but it cannot be seen in Eastern Zhejiang.</p>
<p>The leaves of purple clover are composed of many leaflets. The flowers are lotus-shaped, about the size of a copper coin, and are reddish-purple, with some white ones. They are used in medicine. The fruit forms pods. Judging from its shape, it is clearly different from alfalfa and is also cheaper than alfalfa.</p>
<p>Mr. Qiming believes that alfalfa is commonly called purple clover, but in my hometown (which is naturally also Eastern Zhejiang), this is not the case. Not only is alfalfa still called "草紫" (cǎozǐ), but even purple clover is not called purple clover but "片花" (piànhuā, petal flower). The words "purple clover" are just a decorative touch for writers; they are not commonly used in the countryside. In addition to these two, there are also "马兰头" (mǎlántóu, Chinese aster) and "荠菜" (jìcài, shepherd's purse). "荠菜" (jìcài) is also called "花脸菜" (huāliǎncài, painted face vegetable). Although it is not as fragrant as "马兰头" (mǎlántóu), it is also quite delicious when cooked. They grow around the same time and are found everywhere, making them a staple for the masses of farmers. Every early spring, in the cold and lonely fields, one can often see village girls in groups of three or five squatting by the ridges, picking tender green wild vegetables. They jump and sing, searching for the delicacies that nature has prepared for them.</p>
<p>When I was young, I also followed them to pick and cut, jumping and running. It's hard to forget those lively scenes. Yesterday, I accidentally bought some "荠菜" (jìcài) from the market and couldn't help but recall the past, which made me wonder which village and which girl picked these "荠菜" (jìcài), and I felt strangely sad. After eating it, I felt that the taste was not as good as before, so I added another layer of inexplicable melancholy.</p>
<h3>Soliloquy on a Cold Night by Xing Sheng</h3>
<p>The countryside is bankrupt—"Go to the metropolis," "Go to the metropolis." ——People are all concentrated from the countryside or small cities to the metropolis: Everyone thinks, this is the land of carefree.</p>
<p>Shanghai: It is the first metropolis in China and also a metropolis with a special form in the world.</p>
<p>Shanghai: In a certain society, it is a city that never sleeps; in a certain society, it is a hell that never sees the light of day.</p>
<p>A brilliant and splendid shell, containing a broken and decadent soul: This is precisely the characteristic of a capitalist society. Recently, the new film "Shanghai 24 Hours" directed by Shen Xiling of Mingxing Film Company, I feel is really the clearest portrayal of Shanghai society. It tells you one side of Shanghai's most lewd life, it also tells you one side of Shanghai's darkest life. It tells you: How despicable and filthy the psychology of people in the upper class is, and how bright and upright the spirit of people in the lower class is and full of sympathy.</p>
<p>"Shanghai 24 Hours", in this day and night. You try to imagine: How many episodes of joys and sorrows will happen, how many surprises and happy events, how many petty and opportunistic farces.</p>
<p>"Shanghai 24 Hours", you try to calculate in each hour: How much blood and sweat workers have to shed, how much money flows in the financial capital world, how much money idle gentlemen and ladies have to squander? If there are statistics, what an astonishing number that would be—</p>
<p>International winds and clouds are getting tighter day by day, and internal unrest has risen again, and party strife has not ended. In this era of storms, the singing stage and dancing pavilions, and the brothels and entertainment venues, are always rejoicing all night long, and there is a scene of peace and prosperity. "A merchant girl does not know the hatred of the fall of her country, and still sings 'Backyard Flowers' across the river": I never thought that the Tang poet's words would be a portrait of today's drunken and dreamlike crowd.</p>
<h3>Northeast Fourth Company Commander by Zhang Henshui</h3>
<p>Episode 20: Auspicious Day Ahead, Old Man Smiles Daily; Unending Sadness, Old Friends Live Across the Street</p>
<p>As he said this, he looked at Ding Guizhi and smiled, "In a day or two, I'll have to go to the city. It all depends on your luck. If I collect a lot of debts, I'll buy some more jewelry and some expensive clothing material for you." Guizhi neither agreed nor disagreed, but just lowered her head and smiled. Zhao Weng said, "Really, at my age, what can I do? I'll say whatever I think, and I'll never lie to you." Jiang Shi interjected with a smile, "If it weren't for the old man being so fond of my girl, our two families' marriage might not have been successful. Who can say that the old man would lie to him!" Zhao Weng chuckled again. After talking for a while, he saw that Guizhi was always shy and sitting at the intersection of the inner and outer rooms. He thought to himself, "I'm being inconsiderate again. The young lady is just embarrassed, so why do I keep talking about the wedding in front of her? If people don't know, they might really say that I, as an elder, am being improper." Thinking this, he immediately put on a serious face, bid farewell, and left. Guizhi said in a low voice with a smile, "Look at him, what's it to him? The old man is happy all day and all night." She held the doorframe, leaned on her hand, and stared out the door in a daze. Seeing his grinning expression, it wasn't that he wasn't happy. Jiang Shi said, "When you get to our age, you'll understand. People of our age don't have much to think about. Becoming an official, making money, seeking fame, seeking profit, it's all the same. But the idea of having a house full of sons is stronger than anything else. If, like me, you're a widow for half your life and don't have any sons, just two daughters in two generations, it's hard to watch other families bustling with excitement, but you can only keep the sadness in your heart. With a son-in-law, it's like having half a son more in front of you. It's like having more to rely on. And then to have a few grandchildren..." Jiang Shi was standing in front of her, speaking with relish, when Guizhi pushed her mother with her hand and said, "Stop talking, stop talking, you're saying more and more nonsense." Jiang Shi took a step back and laughed, "This girl is getting more and more spoiled. She's even pushing me with her hand." Guizhi pouted and said, "Who told you to say these things? I don't like it."

<p>World Oddities by Chuyu</p>
<h3>Dishes and Patriotism</h3>
<p>Recently in Paris, France, a young couple held a wedding at a large hotel. After the wedding ceremony, the guests took their seats for a joyous banquet. Some of the dishes contained German ingredients.</p>
<p>A guest noticed this and immediately shouted for the hotel owner to come, scolding him as a traitor. The guests at the table also echoed loudly, surrounding and beating the owner while simultaneously rebuking the bride and groom, smashing all the plates and bowls. By the time the police arrived and managed to mediate, the guests dispersed in anger. As a result, not only did the hotel suffer a great loss, but the bride and groom also suffered greatly.</p>
<h3>The Blind Also Have a Way Out</h3>
<p>In cities with frequent traffic, it is very dangerous for the blind to go out, but if they don't go out, they will surely starve to death. In Madrid, the capital of Spain, there are a thousand blind people. They have come up with a way to avoid danger and earn a living, which is to form groups of seven each day, led by a sighted person, to sell lottery tickets in a specific area. As a result, sales are very brisk, and each person's earnings are enough to support a family.</p>
<h3>The First Female Minister</h3>
<p>The world's first female minister was Miss [Margaret] Bondfield of England. She served as the Minister of Labour in the Labour Cabinet from 1929 to 1931 and is an internationally known figure in the labor community. She is known for her fairness and insight and is one of the most respected figures in international women's labor groups worldwide.</p>
<h3>Lawsuit Involving Mother and Son Kissing</h3>
<p>Johan Maher, a famous wealthy man in Vienna, already sixty years old, remarried a fifty-year-old woman. The old woman was single and had no children. Longing for a child, she, upon arriving at Maher's house, kissed Maher's son (who was already thirty-two years old) an unknown number of times each day.</p>
<p>Maher was very unhappy in his heart and filed for divorce with the court. The first trial verdict: "A mother in law, kissing her son twice a day is appropriate, but because she doesn't know the number of times and often kisses, filing for divorce, the reason is not sufficient." Maher refused to accept this and appealed to the High Court. The High Court's final verdict: "Saying that the relationship between mother and son in law, even kissing an unknown number of times a day, is permissible, but one must not offend the father's anger. Past events do not need to be pursued, from today onwards, one should obey the husband's wishes and not kiss the son often.</p>
<h3>Village of Gold</h3>
<p>Within the territory of Yugoslavia are the three major rivers of Jucolasv, the Democ, Mulapa, and Pech.</p>
<p>The muddy water in the rivers all contains placer gold. The farmers in the nearby river basin have traditionally collected placer gold as a side business. The method of collection involves driving dozens of sheep into the river, causing the placer gold in the river water to attach to the sheep's wool, and then driving the sheep ashore and washing the placer gold out of the wool. This method has a history of centuries. Recently, experts in the country investigated the riverbed and found huge amounts of placer gold deposits. Using electric dredging machines to gradually extract the gold, the nearby farmers feared losing their jobs, causing widespread panic and collectively stopping the work. Later, after the government explained the reasons, stating that the dredging did not affect their side business of grazing sheep, the situation calmed down.</p>
<h3>Sparrows Make a Big Fuss in the Chimney</h3>
<p>The chimney of the Richmond City Hall in Virginia, USA, is filled with the corpses of tens of millions of sparrows every spring and autumn.</p>
<p>The people managing the hall are unable to deal with the sparrows.</p>
<p>The city authorities, in order to thoroughly eliminate the sparrow pest, ordered the hall to cover all the chimneys with wire mesh every spring and autumn, so that the sparrows could not get close. As a result, the flocks of sparrows have all flown elsewhere this year.</p>

<h3>Education News</h3>
<p>Outlying Areas: Zhejiang Province's Education Funds Independent - First Implementation Yesterday</p>
<p>Zhejiang Province's educational funding has had arrears annually, leading to difficulties in running schools. Subsequently, the principals of various provincial schools jointly petitioned the authorities, proposing that educational funds be managed under special appropriations to comply with ministerial orders. The provincial government decided in a meeting to designate stamp taxes and surcharges on tobacco and alcohol to be used as the source of funds. Now, the Department of Finance has remitted 90,000 yuan from stamp taxes and notified the Department of Education. After the Department of Education approved the remittance, it immediately opened the amount to be issued for the November education funds yesterday and requested the Department of Finance to instruct various schools to collect the funds by a specific date. It is said that the funds issued to each school this time will account for 75% in cash. The remaining 25% will be supplemented by a payment notice issued by the Department of Finance.</p>
<h3>Belgium Stipulates New Regulations to Restrict Foreign Students Due to Too Many Students Going to Belgium</h3>
<p>According to reliable information from the Belgian Embassy, in recent years, too many students from various countries have gone to Belgium to study. The Belgian government has specially stipulated new regulations to restrict them. The new regulations are translated as follows: Article 1. All foreign students going to Belgium to study must go to the Belgian embassy or consulate to process passport visa procedures and must bring a valid passport for one year and the student's admission request letter (addressed to the principal of the university the student intends to enter). The admission request letter must state the intended major. In addition, the following documents must be attached: (A) Official certificate, certified by the local official authorities that the student is indeed going to Belgium to study. (B) Certificate of good conduct. (C) Academic certificate. (D) For students studying in Belgium, if there are no provisions in their own country's laws to revoke the nationality of people who avoid military service, the government of that country should prepare a formal statement stating that the student is allowed to return home at any time, even if the student has once lost their stateless status, it should be handled in this way. Those who have already acquired Belgian nationality are not subject to this restriction. (E) If there are no restrictions in the student's country's laws on the export of currency, the government of that country should prepare a formal statement stating that the money necessary for the student's living expenses and tuition fees should not be hindered when taken abroad. (F) A guarantee letter issued by the student's parents or guarantor proving that they will be able to prepare the funds specified in item E. The Belgian embassy or consulate should verify and sign whether this guarantee letter is accurate and whether it complies with the regulations. To prevent students from forging the proof documents. Article 2. Before a student goes to Belgium to study, the Belgian embassy or consulate should examine whether the student has a sufficient level of French or Belgian (i.e., Flamand) and must notify the student that one of the above languages must be tested before formal admission. The Belgian Minister of Education attaches great importance to this language test and has ordered the four Belgian universities to conduct this exam in a very strict manner. Article 3. The Belgian embassy or consulate must add a comment or opinion to the student's application for admission, paying particular attention to the level of French or Belgian. After commenting, the application is returned to the student. Article 4. The student sends the application for admission directly to the intended school. Article 5. Before a student enrolls, the Belgian embassy or consulate should inform the student of the following points and urge them to pay attention: (A) The university will conduct an examination of general science to verify the level of each subject listed in the academic certificate. If the level is insufficient, admission will not be granted. (B) The registration procedure ends entirely on October 30 each year. (C) The registration fee for the four national universities is stipulated to be from 600 million to 750 million. (一) Students going to Belgium, in any case, must wait until the university has vacancies before they can enroll. (E) Students who fail the exam after entering the university will be sent back to their country, but this does not apply to those who fail the exam due to special circumstances. After graduating, it is extremely difficult for students to find a job in Belgium. Once graduated, they must return to their country and must not stay in the country by means of delaying tactics. Students studying in Belgium are not registered in the population register and are not issued residence permits. Article 6. A university's admission permit must be presented for verification when signing the passport, otherwise, a visa will not be granted. Because Belgian universities have been filled with students with poor grades in recent years, and in view of the fact that various countries have strict measures to restrict studying abroad, new regulations have been stipulated, which will be strictly implemented to restrict unqualified foreign students.</p>
<h3>This City's Education Bureau Urges Reporting of Student Registration Information from Various Schools</h3>
<p>The Municipal Education Bureau orders 15 schools, including the China Vocational Middle School, to report to the bureau within 10 days of receiving the document.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau yesterday issued an order to fifteen schools, including the Private China Vocational Middle School, stating: "It has been found that the registration information of new students and transfer students admitted by your school this semester has been repeatedly ordered to be submitted within a time limit, but the school has not yet submitted it after a long period of time. Such negligence is extremely inappropriate. As this semester is about to end, we are issuing a final reminder. You must comply with the repeatedly issued review of student registration procedures and report to the bureau within 10 days of receiving this document. Otherwise, the registration information of all students admitted this semester will not be recognized, and you will be severely punished." The schools include: China Vocational Middle School, Yuqing Middle School, Aurora College Affiliated Middle School, Xuhui Middle School, McTyeire School, Zhende Junior Middle School, Zhengshi Middle School, Cihang Midwifery School, Guohua Middle School, Liangjiang Women's Physical Education Teachers School, Southeast Women's Physical Education Teachers School, East Asia Physical Education Teachers School.</p>
<h3>Municipal Education Bureau Orders All Schools to Assist in Showing Educational Films, Both Receiving the Benefit of Gradual Influence and Avoiding the Temptation of Bad Films</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau yesterday issued an order to all levels of schools in this city, stating: "It is reported by the Shanghai Branch of the China Educational Film Association that since the association is implementing educational films for the first time, it is short of funds and has no way to support itself. It was once entrusted to each school to collect screening fees from students, but since most schools have already started classes, the procedures are cumbersome and difficult to handle. As a compromise, it was decided to collect a screening fee of ten yuan each time the film is shown again, and the order was submitted to the bureau for approval. Since the implementation of this plan, some results have been achieved. However, there are many schools in Shanghai, and while many have shown the films on a regular basis, there are still many who are waiting to see. This has prevented widespread promotion. It seems that the reason for this is that some schools find it difficult to bear the financial burden, which is also the actual situation. In order to promote educational films, the association has decided that from December 1st, when going to each school to show the films again, in addition to collecting the transportation fees for the film projector and films, and the printing costs for the explanatory materials, the screening fees will no longer be collected. It has also been decided that each school will show the films twice a month, and a schedule will be prepared for implementation on a regular basis. This will allow schools to reduce their burden, and students will be able to watch the films for free. In addition to classroom lectures that are full of theory and explanation, students will be able to connect with real-world things at any time, and they will surely benefit more from the assistance of direct visual education. It will both receive the benefit of gradual influence and avoid the temptation of bad films, which will undoubtedly be of great benefit to education. Therefore, the association is promoting educational films with sincerity, seeking to achieve its original intention, and willing to accept any sacrifice. We believe that the sincerity will be approved by the education community, and we also believe that the bureau will be happy to support the implementation. For this reason, we are submitting a document along with two copies of the measures for each school to show educational films and a table of transportation costs, requesting that you issue an order to all levels of schools in the city to assist in implementation earnestly, to stop waiting and see, and to achieve the effect of educational films in all schools in Shanghai in the shortest possible time, and to lay the foundation for the cause of educational films. We respectfully request your review." Attached are two copies of the measures for each school to show educational films and a table of transportation costs. Based on this, in addition to approving the document and issuing separate orders, we are submitting one copy of the aforementioned table for your information.</p>
<h3>Education Groups in the French Concession Request Taxpayer Association to Increase Representation</h3>
<p>Private School Federation and Second District Education Association to Hold Joint Meeting to Discuss Methods</p>
<p>The Shanghai French Concession Chinese Taxpayers Association is about to hold a delegate conference to re-elect Chinese directors and committee members. The Shanghai French Concession Private Primary and Secondary School Federation and the Second District Education Association and other organizations, considering that the Chinese Taxpayers Association is extremely important to the entire French Concession residents and is closely related to the development of education within the concession, have investigated that the association's delegate quota is set at forty-five people, with commercial groups accounting for twenty-four people and citizens accounting for twenty-one people, while education groups have no representatives participating. This seems unfair. Therefore, they have jointly requested that the association increase the number of education group representatives participating in this delegate conference to demonstrate impartiality, and will convene a joint meeting to discuss implementation methods.</p>

For more than two hours, Ren Mengxian from the Merchant Marine School said that teaching mathematics is to cultivate students' perseverance and patience. To make students interested in learning mathematics, teachers must first be interested themselves. Teachers should be interested in studying the errors of the worst students and correct them. Zhu Fenghao said that errors in practice books are best discovered by students themselves, and students should be tested to see if they can truly understand the principles. Zhang Zhonghuan said that in teaching mathematics, teaching materials should focus on practical applications and the exercise of thought, six methods of self-study, many opportunities for practice, and rotating explanations. The attending mathematics teachers all expressed their opinions. The length of the speeches is omitted. Finally, Beixin Bookstore gave away middle school textbooks on algebra, geometry, trigonometry, and arithmetic, requesting comments and corrections.</p>

Before this strong enemy, Is Also had few opportunities to get close to the basket and only scored from long shots. At the beginning of the game, Zheng Zhifang opened the record first, but in a moment, Mailing took the lead with 11 to 4. Mailing transferred a new general to the field, and the situation changed. Zheng Zhifang and Tao Shaosheng scored two goals in a row, but soon Mailing's edge was revealed again. In this high-pitched enemy flame, Is Also's Guan Jinlin shot from a distance like Jiang Miaozhi, hitting three out of three, and the situation was invigorated. At the end of the first half, Mailing took the lead with 36 to 19. In the voice of the war, Mailing still fought with new generals, so the situation was average and the competition was quite fierce. Is Also once chased to 36 to 51, but after that, Mailing's old generals went off the field again, and Is Also's Tao Lesheng and Wang Huating were successively fouled four times and left the field, and they fell into disrepair.

<h3>Hu Zhengqu, an All-Around Athlete from the United States, Arrives in Shanghai Today</h3>
<p>Famous Overseas for Basketball, Baseball, American Football, etc., Highly Respected by Foreigners</p>
<p>Recently, a Chinese sports star, Mr. Hu Zhengqu, a Canadian overseas Chinese, is proficient in various sports. People in Canada call him "all-around athlete" and admire him very much, which is a great honor for our overseas Chinese students. Mr. Hu telegraphed Jiang Kanghu and Huang Jingwan yesterday to report that he had taken the Empress of Canada ship and arrived in Shanghai on the 19th (that is, today), asking them to receive him. The following is a brief history obtained from his girlfriend, Ms. Wu Yunwen. Mr. Hu is from Enping, Guangdong, and is the second son of Mr. Wu Changqi, a wealthy businessman from Guangdong. He is intelligent and physically strong. Since childhood, he has received the cultivation of new education. In addition to being proficient in various academic studies, he has a special understanding of sports. He studied at McGill University for two years and studied Chinese with Dr. Jiang Kanghu (then the president of the Chinese Academy). He repeatedly represented the school in various competitions and returned with honors. Americans sighed that he was a rare genius. Mr. Hu's English name is William, and people often call him Willie. He is proficient in basketball, ice hockey, baseball, and American football, and is recommended by his teammates as the captain. When he was in senior primary school, he showed his athletic talent and was regarded as one of the outstanding athletes. After that, he actively trained and his skills improved greatly. When summer baseball began, he participated in the Monte League baseball league. In the fall, he served as the vanguard of the American football team of the Four Sports Association. He also had superhuman skills in passing. In each season, he was selected as a player for the McGill University team and participated in hockey competitions as a defensive guard and was regarded as a tough defender. Mr. Hu is especially famous in basketball. Four years ago, he and his teammates began to join the youth championship. Finally, he was the representative team of the Central YMCA, and repeatedly won the eastern Canadian youth junior and intermediate championships. Last year, he left the YMCA and represented the residents of Monte City (NDC) team to participate in the senior competition. As a result, unexpectedly, he won the first place. Mr. Hu served as a forward and threw his skills for the entire team, and the team was able to win the championship thanks to Mr. Hu's efforts. Mr. Hu is not only good at sports himself, but also has coaching ability. Last year, he trained the youth team of the Central YMCA, which made them fight back and forth, won the provincial championship, and returned triumphantly. In recent years, considering the non-national affairs and the weakness and depression of the people, Mr. Hu, as a brave and promising young man, is willing to fulfill his responsibility as a citizen and serve the sports world with his superb sports skills, train young people, and hope to wash away the shame of the sick man of East Asia. His ambition is commendable. Mr. Hu arrives in Shanghai today. I hope that the athletes on the sea will welcome him and work together to strengthen the nation.</p>

<p>Free Talk on Demons and Monsters Wu Xi</p>
<p>A friend who works at a foreign firm selling automobiles once told me, "If you want to buy a car, it's best to buy a used one." Why? Because although the style of a used car may not be new, it is sturdy and durable, and its value is slightly higher than that of a new model. You can rely on it. New cars are shiny on the outside, have a new style, look good, and are not expensive, but they are not durable.</p>
<p>Why do people like cars that are not durable and only look good in appearance? After hearing what my friend said, I was very suspicious. He said, "This must be viewed from the perspective of the buyer's psychology. In today's world of economic recession, no wealthy person or businessman can be sure how long they can last. Maybe they will go bankrupt in eight months, or maybe they will have to close down soon. Durability is not something they can think about; what they want is to spend less money in the short term and attract attention in appearance. Who knows if the car will still belong to them in a few months? What's the point of talking about durability?"</p>
<p>This kind of mentality is similarly reflected in movies. Just think back a little, and we can recall that, apart from erotic and sensual films, many demons and monsters movies have recently been imported from abroad. If you want to see supernatural creatures, there are "Death Ray," "Zombies," and so on to satisfy your desires. If you want to see thrilling animal films, there are "Gai Jingchun Dream," "King Kong," and so on for your enjoyment. Even if there is some meaning under the guise of demons and monsters, such as "Leopard Girl," people still won't see it as an ideal work, and still treat it as a monster movie for their enjoyment. Many of these films have been publicly shown, and of course, more will continue to come in the future.</p>
<p>This mentality is the same as buying a car, and they have consistency. Cars with novel styles are particularly popular; movies with demons and monsters are also box office hits whenever they are released. On the one hand, people are extremely afraid and terrified; on the other hand, they can't help but rush to see them first, and even call on friends to watch together. Although watching movies and buying cars are two different things, the bottom line for these people is that they want novel stimulation and momentary pleasure. In their numb nerves, they no longer have the strength to judge what is reasonable and unreasonable.</p>
<p>I think that the main reason why demons and monsters films are constantly evolving is because of this. Why are we heading down this path? I am not an old psychologist, so I cannot explain that this is due to humans having an innate curiosity. It is not due to an innate curiosity, but rather the demand for new stimulation from tired nerves, and a necessary momentary enjoyment in the busy and oppressive modern life: to get to the root of it, this is entirely a manifestation of a decadent and crazy mentality in a crazy world on its way to extinction. This is my interpretation.</p>
<h3>In Memory of Mr. Zhu Xiang Yu Wenwei</h3>
<p>Mr. Zhu Xiang was one of the more famous literary figures in the new literary world. Not only did he have an extremely deep understanding of Western literature, but he also had considerable knowledge of Chinese literature. When he was studying at Tsinghua University, he was as famous as Liang Shiqiu, Wen Yiduo, and others. After Liang and Wen went abroad, Tsinghua University had the famous Three Talents: Wen Ziyuan (Zhu Xiang), Zi Li (Rao Mengkan), and Zi Hui (Yang Zihui), who were all poets in Beijing at the time. When Xu Zhimo founded a poetry journal at the Beijing Morning Post, they were all pillars. At that time, Zhu and Rao were both teaching at the Shicun Middle School that we ran. Besides being together day and night and deepening our friendship over the years, I also gained a lot of literary knowledge from their conversations. After Zhu Xiang returned from the United States the year before last, we asked Mr. Wang Fuwu, the former president of Anhui University, to hire him as a professor. From then on, we worked together, and I gained a lot of edification and encouragement in both scholarship and personality. This was the most unforgettable year of my life. Later, when turmoil occurred at Anhui University, we went our separate ways. I never expected that this separation would be our last. On the day I heard the news of his death, I felt uneasy all day long, grieving for his fate and pitying his talent. It can be said that his death was entirely due to the oppression of society. Of course, his personality was inevitably eccentric, which was known to all his friends. However, his insecure life and the indifference of society towards him were the immediate causes of his suicide. He didn't know that today's society only recognizes money, only recognizes power, only recognizes influence; a talented poet and a poor writer are nothing in its eyes. Mr. Zhu Xiang neither knew how to be a sycophant nor how to fight for power and profit, so in this dark society, he had to sacrifice his life. I am afraid that there are still many people suffering under the oppression of society, living a difficult life in the same situation as him.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhu Xiang's suicide is a reflection of the darkness of modern society, and also a manifestation of modern society's inability to respect literary people. I think that not only will our friends feel sad about this, but anyone in the intellectual class will shed a tear of sympathy.</p>
<p>Finally, I hope that Mr. Wen Yiduo and Mr. Rao Mengkan, who were both classmates with Zhu Xiang and also studied literature, can completely collect Mr. Zhu Xiang's poems and essays and compile them into a book for research and to comfort the deceased.</p>
<h3>Mother Li Huiying</h3>
<p>Braving the light rain on the eve of the Dragon Boat Festival, I walked eight miles and finally returned home.</p>
<p>When I saw my mother, I hugged her tightly, and joyful and sad tears streamed down my face.</p>
<p>It had been more than five years since I had last seen her. I had rarely even seen her in my dreams, but my longing for her grew constantly.</p>
<p>A few tears also welled up in her dim eyes.</p>
<p>"Ying, is that really you? You've really come back?"</p>
<p>She seemed a little disbelieving that I would really come back. Then, she wiped away my tears, released my hand, and urged me to get on the kang and change out of my rain-soaked clothes.</p>
<p>"Mom, you've gotten old."</p>
<p>I looked at her closely. She had aged a lot. Her face was covered with wrinkles, and her hair was completely white.</p>
<p>After I changed my clothes, she leaned against the edge of the kang, hugged me, and said sadly:</p>
<p>"I've been missing you so much, how could I not get old? I often keep my eyes open all night until dawn."</p>
<p>Then, she changed the subject and asked me:</p>
<p>"Where did you come from? Was the road easy to travel?"</p>
<p>I told her about my journey, how I took a boat from Shanghai to Dalian, then a train to Jilin, then a horse-drawn cart to XX Village, and then walked back in the rain.</p>
<p>She was extremely happy after hearing this, but then asked in surprise:</p>
<p>"I heard that the Japanese in Dalian check students. Did you not get checked by the Japanese?"</p>
<p>I explained to her how I got ashore and what kind of questioning I encountered. She didn't ask any further questions and suddenly grabbed my face and kissed me hard. After kissing me, she looked at me closely:</p>
<p>"You're thinner than before. Your face is a bit longer."</p>
<p>"No, I've just grown up."</p>
<p>I said this because I was afraid that she would feel sad if she saw that my face was thin. In reality, how could I not know that I was thin? I have been living outside for several years without a fixed place to stay. My things have been drifting around, so my body naturally wouldn't be good.</p>
<p>The rain outside was still falling, as if it were crying out for the hidden pain of my life outside over the past few years. My younger sister came back with an umbrella, carrying vegetables. She had grown tall. If my mother hadn't introduced us, I wouldn't have thought that she was the mischievous younger sister from five years ago.</p>
<p>My mother and I continued talking.</p>
<p>I asked my mother about the chaos in the countryside last year, and she asked me about the war in Shanghai. Both sides had suffered from turmoil and had no quilts to cover themselves in the dead of winter. They had been robbed by a bunch of bandits, and I had been bombarded by the artillery fire of Japanese imperialism. I couldn't help but say:</p>
<p>"You've suffered too much, Mom."</p>
<p>"You haven't had it easy either." My mother replied in the same way.</p>
<p>After that, my mother asked me about my life outside over the past few years. At first, I really didn't know where to start, and I couldn't tell her the whole truth, or she would be even more sad. But I couldn't help but tell her, so I made up a big, chaotic story. However, this was already enough to make her uneasy. However, over these past few years, she had tasted a multifaceted reality of life to some extent through a difficult real life and tremendous changes. She also gained a little understanding of the complicated world, which strengthened her courage. She said to me angrily:</p>
<p>"It's nothing. In this day and age, the weak are bullied and the strong are feared. It seems that we really have to stand up and do something ourselves."</p>
<p>My mother had transformed into a new stage of person along with the wheels of history. This made me respect and cherish her even more than before.</p>
<p>I hugged her tightly and smiled again. The raindrops outside also seemed to be laughing wildly with us.</p>
<h3>Nalan Chengde's Poetics 1 Chen Liang</h3>
<p>One</p>
<p>Anyone who has dabbled in old books probably knows Nalan Chengde (Rongruo), a Ci poet of the Qing Dynasty, and his "Drinking Water Poetry and Ci." However, his essay collection, "Lushui Pavilion Miscellany," is rarely mentioned, and the original edition is not easy to find. This collection of essays is very important for studying his poetry and Ci, because it can be said to contain all of his poetics. There are about three hundred essays in the book, with a short preface in front. The preface reads:</p>
<p>When I recovered from an illness in the Gui Chou year, I opened and read through the classics and histories, and occasionally had some insights,</p>
<p>So I wrote them down in a separate volume. Or when good friends came to visit and recounted strange news,</p>
<p>I would always record them and store them away after the guests left. After three or four years,</p>
<p>The volume was completed and called "Lushui Pavilion Miscellany," for the browsing of those who like to talk about the past.</p>
<p>Although "Lushui Pavilion Miscellany" is only one volume, the scope it covers is extremely broad. Roughly speaking, from politics, economy, and military affairs to astronomy, geography, history, customs, scenic spots, races, to science, art (including literature, drama, dance), Buddhism, etiquette, legends, anecdotes, flowers, and fruits, it almost covers everything, and most of it is discussed with great insight. Of course, there are also problematic points, such as saying that "there is a side outside of Japan, which the people there call Tokyo." Looking at it now, it is naturally laughable, but one can imagine what people at that time knew about international affairs. Here, based on the part where he discusses rhyme, I have organized it into a "Nalan Chengde's Poetics" article. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Two Brothers Sixty-Three Guy de Maupassant, Translated by Li Weike</h3>
<p>Seven</p>
<p>On the way back in the carriage, except for Chezanne, the other men were dozing. Boitrel and Roland kept falling onto the shoulders of the people next to them every five minutes, and the person being leaned on would shake them off. Then they would straighten up, stop snoring, open their eyes, and grumble, "Nice weather, isn't it?" But almost as soon as they finished speaking, they would immediately fall to the other side again.</p>
<p>By the time they returned to Le Havre, the two of them were sleeping so soundly that it took a lot of effort to wake them up. Boitrel even refused to go to Chezanne's house for the refreshments that were waiting for them. Everyone had to let him get out of the carriage at his own doorstep.</p>
<p>This young lawyer was going to sleep in his new home for the first time tonight. He was able to show his fiancée, who would soon be visiting, the house just now, so he suddenly felt a kind of ecstasy, a slightly childish ecstasy.</p>
<p>The maid had already left. Mother Roland had said that she would boil the water herself and serve the guests herself because she didn't want the servant to stay up all night, afraid of candles.</p>
<p>Apart from her, her son, and the workmen, no one had been in to see the place, so that others would be surprised when they suddenly saw such a beautiful house.</p>
<p>Chezanne asked everyone to wait at the entrance. He went to light the candles and lamps, leaving Mrs. Le Miler, his father, and his brother in the dark. Then he called out, "Come in!" and threw the doors wide open.</p>
<p>In the glass-paneled hallway, a chandelier hung, and many colorful glass lamps were hidden among the palm trees, oak trees, and flowers, making it look like a stage set. For a moment, everyone was a little stunned. Father Roland, shocked by this wealth, muttered, "Damn," and almost wanted to clap his hands in praise.</p>
<p>Then everyone walked into the first living room. It was not large, and the walls were covered with gold-trimmed silk, and the chairs were also made of the same silk. The conference room was furnished very simply, with walls and chairs all covered in light red silk, making it look very grand.</p>
<p>Chezanne sat in the armchair in front of his desk, which was full of books, and said in a solemn, slightly pretentious tone:</p>
<p>"Yes, Madam, clear legal provisions have just led me to accept your commission, and make me absolutely confident that the matter we are now discussing will be resolved satisfactorily in less than three months."</p>
<p>He looked at Mrs. Le Miler, who was smiling at Mother Roland, while Mother Roland grabbed her hand and held it tightly.</p>
<p>Chezanne was radiant, flailing his arms and legs like a middle school student, shouting:</p>
<p>"Ha, you see how loud it is to speak in this house! This living room is perfect for arguing a case."</p>
<p>He began to declaim loudly:</p>
<p>"If only humanity, if only our natural goodwill towards all suffering, could be the reason for the pardon we seek from you, we would appeal to your compassion, Judge, appeal to your father's heart and the heart of man: but we also have the law to help us, and what we want to present to you now is only this legal question:..."</p>
<p>Philippe looked at this house that was originally going to be his and couldn't help but feel a sense of regret for his brother's playful behavior. He felt that he was indeed very silly and didn't have much of a brain.</p>
<p>Mother Roland opened a door on the right.</p>
<p>"This is the bedroom," she said.</p>

<p>Commercial News: Financial and Gold Markets Extremely Idle, Hovering Within the 700 Yuan Mark; Futures Silver Exchange Rate Slightly Drops 2 Yuan 3 Jiao</p>
<p>The gold market slightly declined yesterday, but the fluctuations throughout the day were minimal, and the market was extremely idle. The outlook for the market is the same. In the early morning, although the overseas silver market in the UK and the US shrank, the distant silver prices on the Five Metals Exchange rose by 5 Hao to 3 Li. The exchange rate was also fearful, with London spot gold falling by 3 pence, the US official gold buying price remaining unchanged, stock prices falling by 1 Yuan 8 Jiao 9 Fen, US cotton falling by 9 pounds, and US wheat rising and falling. The opening price for rough gold was reduced to 698 Yuan, but due to more short-covering activity, it rose to over 700 Yuan, but the morning opening price still retreated to 700 Yuan supply. The HSBC exchange rate remained unchanged, so the gold price lacked special changes. In the morning session, the price only fluctuated by 1 Yuan 6 Jiao, and it was always difficult to cross the 700 Yuan mark. In the afternoon session, the market sentiment was calm and tired. The opening was still stable, but the gold price slightly declined due to the loosening of the domestic market. It was found that the day was extremely mediocre, and the standard price was 1076 Yuan. The swap spread for the current period was around 9 Yuan. Today, the market situation will be recorded below:</p>
<p>The opening price in the morning was 699 Yuan 8 Jiao, down 2 Jiao from last Saturday. The material price opened at 700 Yuan. The exchange rate opened with the near-term selling price of the British exchange rate at 1 shilling 3 pence 625, and the US exchange rate at 33 and a half Yuan. Although the base price was drawn for the April US dollar at half a Yuan, it was difficult to sell shortly afterward. Yuan Mao Yong repeatedly came to supply, retreating to 8 Yuan 2 Jiao.

<h3>Incident at the Jiaotong University vs. Jinan University Soccer Game</h3>
<p>China's Quan Jun's Confession</p>
<p>Respectfully, on the 16th of this month, during the soccer game between our school, Jiaotong University, and Jinan University, an unfortunate incident occurred due to a dispute over a ball, resulting in an assault on the referee. Our school is currently investigating the matter. However, the "Shishi Xinbao" newspaper suddenly published on the 17th that Shen Guoquan, the Director of Physical Education at Jiaotong University, supposedly stated that the penalty for that ball was unwarranted. I, in fact, did not make such a statement. I directly inquired with the referee, Mr. Shen, and he also denied that such words were spoken. As a physical education instructor who always emphasizes sportsmanship, I sent a letter requesting a correction. Unexpectedly, your newspaper also published the same statement today. I solemnly declare to your newspaper that I did not say those words and request that you correct the record. As for other trivial matters, public opinion will judge what is right and wrong, and I do not wish to argue. Respectfully submitted to the "Shenbao" Newspaper, Shen Guoquan, December 18th.</p>
