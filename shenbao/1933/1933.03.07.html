<p>自錦義相繼淪於敵手。北滿僅餘義軍。困戰年餘。東北三省遍被敵騎蹂躪。而交通工具。完全握諸敵人掌中。自打虎山至通遼。錦州至北票兩支線。尤關重要。蓋日軍在北可以循遼河西上。進扼「開魯」。在南可以由北票襲朝陽。故熱河之危。不自今日始。亦不自今年始。乃自錦義失陷。北滿不守而即已顯著。此種情勢。當局者豈不知之。况扼守熱河。在軍事上小之足以接濟義軍。會議僞國政權動摇不定。大之如我國以武力收回東北。亦可以奇兵直搗背。然而年餘以來。我東北當局。毫無布置。一旦敵軍來攻。相繼潰退。週間竟棄熱河如遺。</p>
<p>負華北軍事總責者。乃缷過於義勇軍。責其不發一彈。其實義勇軍之本質。原非正面應敵之正式部隊。而爲游擊性質。盡人皆知。矧近代國際戰爭。必有整個計劃。彼東北義勇軍。無餉無衣。忍饑耐寒。持少數腐窳器械。以與兵精糧足之敵相抗。在困苦萬狀中。勉强撑持年餘。所憑者僅有血肉。縱未能盡數殉國。其志亦已可嘉。其行亦甚可佩。逈非平日擁兵自大敵至望風而逃之湯玉麟可比。湯固不足責。而付湯以守熱河之責者誰耶。</p>
<p>日軍侵略東北　原欲借此以解决其當前經濟之恐慌。重新求得經濟的平衡。然於其囊括東三省之後。内在矛盾。愈形展開、於是更進而襲占熱河。以東北煤鐵等儲藏之富。旣無濟於日本之經濟恐慌。熱河之羊毛。又烏能止日本之貪慾。况敵方利誘方法。層出不窮。又挾精銳武器。以爲後援。是以承德失陷之後。灤平相繼不守。古北口且有被侵之虞。恐今後問題。喜峯口冷口。尙爲其小焉者耳。正面危險。恐在平津。而側面受敵。將在多倫也。</p>
<p>縱使日閥顧彼國力。暫不盲進。或以爲平津關係複雜。日軍未必敢輕於挑衅。致惹國際糾紛。殊不知今日之英美各國。無不精疲力竭。呻吟於經濟恐慌狂潮之中。美國之金融恐慌。由「米西干州開始。今已遍被乎全美。美國新政府欲克復此次恐慌。已甚不易。尙何暇顧及遠東。故我今日而仍欲依恃他人。爲外交上之折衝。緩和日兵之盲進。則甚於緣木求魚。飲鴆而止渴也。爲民族生存計。應立即抛棄一切空想。從事於實力的戰爭。以鐵拳開血路。勿灰心。勿餒氣。奮勇猛進。方有生存餘地。</p>

<p>解救金融危機美禁金出口</p>
<p>實際已放棄金本位制全世界市塲均蒙影響</p>
<p>總统下令銀行休業至星期五授政府以管理全國通幣特權並召集特别議會製定救濟案</p>
<p>（紐約）羅斯福總统今日下令、以絶對管理全國金供給之權授予政府、該令並宣布禁止金銀出口、禁止撥金付外國、及全中國銀行休業至星期四日後、（六日路透電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）美總统羅斯福今夜宣布全國銀行悉行停市至星期五、並命各銀行暫停支付所存黄金及其他貨幣、此舉蓋欲统一各州狀况、以便總统與其顧問人員及國會議員等澈底研究時局、制定救濟法案也、至國會新衆議員將於星期四宣誓就職、大約星期五即可考慮總统與國會領袖所提出之議案、（五日國民電）</p>
<p>（紐約）　羅斯福總統今日下令除禁止金銀出口外、准頒佈關於發行清算所票據之條例、及禁止右幣之窖藏、此令於今晨一時實施有效、銀行界認此爲美國取銷金本位之舉、但僅以銀行休假期爲限、查銀行休假期、將終止於星期四日、此間某重要銀行家今日稱羅總統此舉甚爲適當、美國金幣近亦流出　甚多、此令旣可使金幣不復流出、且可使國會從容製定較有永遠性質之救濟案云、同時各銀行現準備發行清算所票據數萬萬元、加以目前流通之通幣、當可使充分商業在此吃緊時期中進行無礙、財政部長伍定伸説總統之意、謂美國並未放棄金本位、凡認爲取銷金本位者、實鑄大錯、此僅爲一種管理的通幣之狀態、瑞士爲金本位國、但亦禁止現金出口云、（六日路透社電）</p>
<p>（紐約）　美國已放棄金本位、而根據有效的方法、採用一種管理的通幣、其期限無定、財長伍定雖切實否認放棄金本位、然實際確爲放棄、不過此或爲臨時辦法耳、銀行休假期滿後、外國在美存欵之地位如何、現爲衆所猜測之事件、據財政專家意見、美國一時不能容許自由提取現金、非行停止國内現金付欵、則銀行將不能開門照常營業、故現金出口似將受限制、暫時現金似未可自由輸出也、羅斯福總統警告窖藏家之言論、含有日後對於藏金徵收特稅之意、此種恫嚇言論、能否倕現金復入銀行、尙不可必、衆料金融潮中將來結果之一、將爲政府嚴密監督下銀行制度之組織、以代目前龐雜發生之多數銀行、一航市塲中之反響、將視尋常銀行業恢復前所取之最後行動而定、物品市塲現尙未受政府、公布之影響、但星期二日能否開市、雖尙示决定、而仍屬疑問也、外匯市塲似將正式停閉、但此間及外處私作交易者或有之、如美國果最後、</p>
<p>决定放棄金本位、則已感困難之世界市塲、將遇有另一有力之竟爭家、其結果將擾亂市塲、惟此種發展、視美幣低落之程度而定、各種物品所受之影響、亦未能預定、例如棉花可望漲價、惟漲至何種程序、須視不可預料之發展而定、至於進口物品生絲等、其会位如何、亦難預定、絲價或將因日幣並美匯價漲起、而亦漲價、絲價旣漲、則其銷路將減、此種發展、亦將使日本感受一種貿易上之逆勢、（六日路透電）</p>

<p>（華盛頓）　美全國銀行中四百萬萬元存欵、今日以羅斯福總統一舉筆而悉成呆欵、商業往來須用票據清理所小票、交易在星期五以前、不准有一金元流出銀行、美國銀行家違此禁令者、將受十年以下之監禁與一萬元以下之罰金、</p>

<p>羅氏此舉頓成爲美國金融界之狄克推多、握有戰時所賦總統之狄克推多權力、查美國關於金融之法令、向無如此嚴　者、亦足見局勢之嚴重矣、命令内雖規定總統與財長得對於各個銀行特弛禁令、但料在此短時期間、未敢開此特例也、</p>
<h3 id="c26">財長否認棄金本位風潮可望即息 <a href="#c26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>現總統正與其顧問人員準備提出國會之方案、財長則於發表此令後、立即宣稱、美國並未放棄金本位、保證金融潮不日即可平息、早復繁榮之境、總統亦説明其握此金融特權之理由、謂外國之收回存欵與國内之提欵、實造成此全國緊急狀態、故不得不加以限制云云、</p>
<h3 id="c27">禁令適用全美銀行屬地酌量變通 <a href="#c27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>今此禁令適用於本國與屬地之一切銀行·信託公司·及建築與貸欵會社·經營變相銀行業務之公司等、惟對於屬島之銀行、財長得酌量情形、准其在續奉命令以前、照當營業、現聞斐島方面已向財部保證該島銀行力能應付存户合理之提欵、請其特許照常營業、此外又規定本國内流動金特别豐富之銀行、亦可由財部酌量情形、准其照常營業、按此令效力、不啻一最嚴厲之禁金出境、不僅禁止支付或輸運現金、即將現金加以標誌、作爲某項賬户所有物、亦在禁阻之列、質言之、各銀行所有現欵概須存儲原處、即由此銀行送往彼銀行、亦所不許、但在　内如有願以現欵存入銀行者、則可另開特别賬户、此欵當另行存儲、存户仍得隨時提取、不受限制、又按照命令、財長得於　時查明各銀行現欵及其營業狀况、决定何時可以安全、許甚復業、</p>
<h3 id="c28">小票發行另訂條例財長有監督權 <a href="#c28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>再對於票據清理所小票之發行、財長亦有監督之權、此項小票須由各城鎭銀行完全担保、但僅得於財部對於該地銀行流動金總數認爲可以滿意担保時、始得發行、目下財部正草擬發行條例、將由財政監督於上、各區聨邦儲備銀行直接管理於下、其票在目前雖作現欵使用、但將來不能兌現、祗可送回銀行、作爲存欵、又各銀行亦須决定其所收存欵總宅之百分之幾、領用小票、然後將此成數通知存户、俾存户可預行支配其營業用欵與生活費、至關於證劵與物品交易所之開市與否、雖未加限制、但財長聲稱、料在屋期五以前未必開市云、（六日國民電）</p>

<p>（馬尼刺）　今日菲律濱各銀行拒銀接受美國各銀行支票匯票、但聲稱、此不過臨時辦法、大半由於美國金融狀况消息稀少所致、逆料美國於星期一開市後、時局當可澄清、惟此間絶無驚惶之象、一般執有美匯票者皆願靜待、菲總督羅斯福昨夜與本島官東及銀行家會商後宣稱、菲島銀行狀况絶佳、（六日國民電）</p>

<p>會辦何德奎接見談無結果</p>
<p>明日工部局董事會將討論</p>

<p>請願情形　該會請願代表、於昨日上午十時許、向工部局當局請願、由會辦何德奎延見、各代表陳述斷水後之痛苦、要求向水公司交莎、即日開水、據答復云、現各方正在討論之中、已有相當成效、俟星期三董事會提出討論後、即有處置辦法云云、該代表等以此種言論、早已見諸報端、要求總辦親自答復、因總辦不見、遂無結果而散、</p>
<p>請願呈文　謹呈者、查滬東各里坊、被英商自來水公司以斷水手段、希圖勒收、以表計算、激成鉅額之水費後、住户無以爲炊、生命岌岌可危、本會職責有關、特派邱嘉樑·陳寳世·陳心田·瞿清華·王堯增·高挹羣·等晋謁總辦、面呈苦况、務乞飭令水公司速即恢復供水、並拒絶按户裝用水表制、以救民生、無任感荷、</p>
<p>公司表示　據可靠消息、水費自有關係方面調停後、據水公司表示、住户用水、須有限制、每人每日以七介倫爲度、譬如每一幢屋中、以十六人計算、每月需用水三千三百六十介倫、每千介倫六角四分計算、合洋二元零八分、如超過以上需數、則照例收費、現由有關方面力爭、以每人每日最少須廿三介倫供給、（因歐美亦有限制每人每日用二十三介倫爲限）其水費按房租十分之一計算、現正在商洽中、如有結果、即提交明日（星期三）工部局董事會討論决定云、</p>
<p>求同待遇　滬東楊樹浦路周家牌路順成里、自遭一二八戰事後、情形十分蕭條、業主鑒於商人之痛苦、故即自動减租、該處店面、每幢每月租金僅三十元、自去年六月後、並减收八折、故賓主間甚爲相安、順成里房屋、與其同一業主、而待遇不同、因此引起房客之不滿、特組織自治會、要求業主一視同仁、八折减租、無如業主遷延迄今、並不履行、此次又受斷水之痛、於前日召開自治會議决、將最近應付房租、存入中國銀行信託部、以促業主之覺悟、期達到减租之目的云、</p>

<p>丨丨古英君訊丨丨</p>
<p>我的生命，我的未來底幸福，我的一切。丨現在都飛在狂風般的環境中；我有時感覺到悲哀，但有時也會有　理想使我感覺到興奮。我自己的人生觀，一向是飄飄無定丨丨這因爲是環境的關係丨丨所以我時常念到我自己「人生何歸宿」？啊！我年紀漸漸大了，我是已經十七歲的「人」了，我的意志，我自信也足能對付我的環境，但我「自己」所具有的學問，因爲在幼時家庭的經濟，是非常束縳的，說來也眞可憐，我至今還及不到一個小學畢業的人，但因爲在失學的數年中，每天在公共閱報的地方，讀着報紙，這便是唯一的嗜好，所以也稍受着了一些應用的智識。但我到了現在，我感覺到「人生的歸宿」底悶鬱，所以，我每天都在理想中過生活。但我覺悟了，記者先生，我把我將要求所得的東西，告訴先生。　我自信我的個性，是適合於研究哲學的，但我對於社會科學和自然科學都發生興趣，尤其對於文藝的研究，美學的鑑賞。記者先生，我的意志，我將來的歸宿，都在上述的區區數字之中解剖得很清明了。所以我現在做一個問題來請先生答覆我：我進學校當然是可能的了，所以我對於研究哲學社會科學自然科學以及文藝美學的門徑，當然惟有自修的一條路了。但我的意志是非常糢糊的，自修的門徑，應該「怎樣走呢」？記者先生，你不要以爲可笑；我雖没偉大的天才，但深信我的志願告訴我，「我將要做一個哥德）Ｊ.W.Goethe）第二」·！記者先生你覺到可笑嗎？我將怎樣讀畢上面所述的各科書籍？雖然書是讀不完的，但這是我另一個見解，請先生的答覆我。於後，我想請先生替我解决一個青年的通常病戀愛，戀愛雖是青年的所最需要的東西，但我按之現在的環境，對於戀愛却還很懐疑呢。戀愛是妨礙讀書的麽？怎樣能避去，不談戀愛？怎樣才配談到戀愛？不是拜金主義的戀愛，是彌羅（Ｍirl）式的戀愛。爲了時間的侷促，所以寫的個個是非常拙劣而且十足矛盾的，所以這一點要請先生鑒諒。</p>
<p>答：來書讀罷，答覆如左：（一）讀書不一定要進學校（這自然是不得已的辦法），在公共閱報所可以讀書，在流通圖書館也可以讀書，並且這樣地讀書是在生活的奮鬭中進行的，這種讀書才是活讀書，不是死讀書。你要學哲學，你可先讀一讀法：「社會科學根本問題」李達譯（心弦書店），「歷史的唯物論」（現代書局），「辨證法經典」（亞東）；讀了以上三書；你自然會找到你所欲研究得各種科學的門徑。（二）你「要做一個哥德第二」，我勸你不必。自然是十八世紀的哥德是值得我們景仰的，然而我們景仰自然科學家與文學家的哥德，至多也只得和我們景仰自然科學家與哲學家的康德一樣他倆都不是勞苦大衆的代言人，哥德後來且成了貴族。現代的我們用不着哥德第二，因爲他不能代表我們反抗帝國主義的呼聲，他不能鼓盪我們與惡勢力奮鬭。我們用不着哥德第二，我們至少需要高爾基第二，巴比塞第二，辛格萊第二，願足下勉之！（三）戀愛不是絶對有害的，然而在一個性情輕躁，血氣未定，閱歷少而年齡未達二十以上的青年，是絶對地有害、至少是害百分之九十九，所謂「害多而利少」！要想避去牠没有善法，無已，只有你下决心去研究學問：、</p>
<p>，如果你對於文學，藝術，或哲學與其牠歷史科學，眞正用一番工夫，自然發生奇趣，那時或則你的精神有所繫屬，不會鎭日價談纞愛。最後，我還要請敎，記者對於戀愛很少留心，足下所謂「彌羅Ｍril式的戀愛」見何書，幸賜敎。</p>

<h3 id="c183">從諷刺到幽默 <a href="#c183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>— 何家幹</p>
<p>諷刺家，是危險的。</p>
<p>假使他所諷刺的是不識字者，被殺戮者，被囚禁者，被壓迫者罷，那很好，正可給讀他文章的所謂有敎育的智識者嘻嘻一笑。更覺得自己的勇敢和高明。然而現今的諷刺家之所以爲諷刺家，却正在諷刺這一流所謂有敎育的智識者社會。</p>
<p>因爲所諷刺的是這一流社會，其中的各分子便各各覺得好像刺着了自己，就一個個的暗暗的迎出來，又用了他們的諷刺，想來刺死這諷刺者。</p>
<p>最先是說他冷嘲，漸漸的又七嘴八舌的說他謾駡，俏皮話，刻毒，可惡，學匪，紹興師爺，等等，等等。然而諷刺社會的諷刺，却往往仍然會「悠久得驚人」的，即使捧出了做過和尚的洋人或專辦了小報來打擊，也還是没有效，這怎不氣死人也麽哥呢！</p>
<p>樞紐是在這里：他所諷刺的是社會，社會不變，這諷刺就跟着存在，而你所刺的是他個人，他的諷刺倘存在，你的諷刺就落空了。</p>
<p>所以，要打倒這樣的可惡的諷刺家，只好來改變這社會。</p>
<p>然而社會諷刺家究竟是危險的，尤其是在有些「文學家」明明暗暗的成了「王之爪牙」的時代。人們誰高興做「文字獄」中的主角呢，但倘不死絶，肚子裏總還有半口悶氣，要借着笑的幌子，哈哈的吐他出來。笑笑旣不至於得罪别人，現在的法律上也尚無國民必須哭喪着臉的規定，並非「非法」，蓋可斷言的。　　我想：這便是去年以來，文字上流行了「幽默」的原因，但其中單是「爲笑笑而笑笑」的自然也不少。</p>
<p>然而這情形恐怕是過不長久的，「幽默」旣非國産，中國人也不是長於「幽默」的人民，而現在又實在是難以幽默的時候。於是雖幽默也就免不了改變樣子了，非傾於對社會的諷刺，即墮入傳統的「說笑話」和「討便宜」。</p>

<p>— 艾蕪</p>
<p>兩　個閒得無聊的朋友，眞討厭，竟尋起我的開心來了。偏把一個毫不相干的小女人，聨在我身上，硬派爲我的愛人；他們兩張嘴巴一齊說，全不由我分辯。結果，我生氣了，連不十分人耳的話，也回警了過去。不過平心靜氣地想想，他們的無理取閙，也不是憑空飛來的。因爲我一聽到那小女人唱着悽惋的歌曲，總不知不覺地，在臉上，口上，流露出悲惻的心情。</p>
<p>這可笑而又可惱的事，是發生在印度洋岸邊的仰光　Lockup裏面；我同兩個朋友都因犯了印度政府的第X條法律，上據說是犯了危害當地政府的罪，被英帝國主義請了進去。那時正是一九三一年的初間。Lockup内的房間，滿漂亮的，電燈和西式毛厠通不缺少，同我在仰光郊外亞弄區住的緬甸屋子一比，無論如何，我的物質生活，總算是大大地跨高了一級的。不過住久了，也討厭，何况又缺少生活的要素丨自由呢？大概因爲三個中國人都是政治犯的原故吧，一進去就同别的囚徒隔開；於是一間屋子，便成了我們三個人佔有的世界了。而三個人，在外面，就彼此怪熟悉的，因此，處在進個無聊的世界裏，便簡直找不出一點新鮮的有趣的故事，拿來掛在嘴上。大家只有卽景生情地在對於方的身上，栽誣一點令他笑也不是氣也不是的趣話。我們就這樣地把整天整天的好時光，全放在互相打趣的游戲裏了。另外還有一點高興的事情，就是每天午飯後，看守的印度鬍子把鐵欄門打開，讓我們到屋後一條露天的過道上散散步，仰頭看看藹然可親的藍空，總是喜歡得高舉兩臂，想把鮮美的空氣，完全吞進肺裏。有時望見一隻不知名的飛鳥，閃着黑的翅子，在晴明的空中掠過，我們的飄渺的遐思便好像給牠的雙　載去了，寂寞的心地上跟着泛起淡淡的鄉愁。過道對面，排立着些較小的房間，簷頭垂着疎疎朗朗的綠葉籐，門上掛着Female　Cage　的黑漆木牌，這，打動了我們好奇的心，每次散步時，總要悄悄地立在窗下一會兒，打算看看裏面的女囚徒。但每一　都是陰沉沉的，只裝滿了冷寞，没有半個人影。</p>
<p>有一夜，忽然Female　Cage那邊傳來了女人的歌聲，正坐得乏味的我們，便一齊給歌聲擒了住屏着氣，聽下去。</p>
<p>「·················」</p>
<p>呵，我認清了你們是誰呀！</p>
<p>把我丈夫殺在芒果林裏的，</p>
<p>可不是你們這些毒蛇嗎？</p>
<p>茅屋也給你們放火燒了，</p>
<p>如今又把我捉拿，</p>
<p>請，要打就打，要殺就殺，</p>
<p>你們這些毒蛇呀！</p>
<p>·············」</p>
<p>一個印度鬍子大聲喝止着，歌聲如同胡琴斷了弦一般，立卽停止了。</p>
<p>「眞是一個可憐的女人呵！」這嘆息像給彈簧一彈，突地從我心裏跳了出來。兩個朋友雖不十分懂得這緬語的歌曲，但那女性聲調的哀婉和悽慘，却也穿透了他倆的心靈；因爲，他倆的眉宇間，登時浮動着一脈的憫惻的同情。夜深，腰部帶着一大串鎖匙的印度鬍子，走到鐵欄門前查看的時候，我們就找些話問及那唱歌的女囚徒。從他那不高興回答的嘴裏，也打探不出什麽，不過約略知道那有着哀婉歌聲的女人，確是從達拉瓦底縣捉來的「强盜婆」。誰不知道達拉瓦底縣是一九三０年十二月緬甸農民暴動的發源地呢？那女人，無疑地是一位反帝戰士的妻子了。於是在我那對她有着哀憫的心上，不知不覺地又添上了莊嚴的敬意。並且由那女人歌裏的意思，我就懂得暴動的農民爲什麽要用那樣奇怪的旗幟了。在我被捕之前，曾看見英政府從農民那邊奪回來的旗子，是一幅三角形的白布，繪着一條遍身鱗甲的大蛇，給一位威風凜凜的神人踏在地上掙扎。那神人有着一付雷公嘴，頭上頂着小尖塔，手肘上長着一對翅子；左手緊揑着蛇尾，右手的刀作着快要砍下的姿勢丨這顯然是一幅英緬鬭爭的剪影，巨蛇不正是象徵着毒害全緬的帝國主義嗎？</p>
<p>一九三一年的緬甸，正在開始咆哮的時候，每天鐵欄門前陰森森的過道上，總有一隊龐雜的足聲，伴着鐵鍊的噪響，刮耳地流了進來。我們把眼睛嵌在鐵條縫裏就看見椎髮文身，着有紅綠布裙的農民的影子，帶着愁苦的棕黄的瘦臉，一個個晃了過去。間或還有披着黄色袈裟裸露半臂的僧人，埀着光濯濯的頭，也同他們一塊兒被押着走。但這些犯人，通關不上一二天，就都又配到仰光中央監獄去了。留在這個Lockup内的，只是一些案情不重的囚徒。至於那個會唱歌的「强盜婆」，却拘在這兒比較久些，也許就因爲是女人的原故吧？（未完）</p>

<p>— 蕭伯訥作　宜閑譯</p>
<p>「（鐵開）是什麽？」　亞拉伯人說，一面將他長袍整一整，使摺紋服帖些。</p>
<p>「是值三辨士的角子」術士說。「這爲什麽　造的呢？因爲闊的人們不好意思被人家看見，給我銅子，又以爲六辨士太多了。」</p>
<p>「人們待我這樣子，我是不高興的，」那亞拉伯人說「多也有着要傳達的使命啦。我的民衆，如果不管他們呢，他們就會伏地禮拜那個　頭上的各種造像的。如果什麽造像也没有呢，他們也會禮拜石頭的。我的使命就是惟那獨一無二的光榮偉大的上帝纔有着威嚴和權力。他的像從來是誰也不敢造的；如果有誰試犯這種罪呢，我就會忘却上帝仁慈，克服我的軟弱，簡直親手來殺那個人的了。在肉體的形式上，誰想像得到上帝的偉大？便是阳好的馬的造像也不能將他的美，他的偉大傳達出一點神氣來的。哪哪，我告訴他們這話的時候他們也請我變戲法，我對他們說，我是同他們一樣的人，對他們說，上帝自己也不能違犯自己的法的丨丨如果想像得到他做着什麽不法的事的話，那時候，他們就走開去，宣傳我行着奇跡了。他們却也信仰着，因爲如果他們疑惑呢，我就使那些信仰的人將他們殺掉了。你也應當這麽幹纔是，朋友。」</p>
<p>「我所傳達的使命却是他們不應當自相殘殺」術士說。「人得有團結的精神。」</p>
<p>「就他們私人的爭閙說來，」這是一點不錯。」那亞拉伯人說。「然而我們却必須將那些不適於生活的人殺掉纔行。我們在園地上澆水固然要緊，拔草也一樣的要緊」</p>
<p>「誰來做我們的適於生活問題的裁判者呢？」術士說。「最高的政府要人們，帝國的總督們，以及高級的祭司們覺得我是不適於生活的。大約他們是不錯的罷。」</p>
<p>「關於我自己呢，他們下了正是一樣的决斷。」那亞拉伯人說「我不得不逃走了。我一直躱避到我說得壯健的青年們丨丨人數儘夠多子丨丨相信他們的長者們是誤解了我：其實，眞理不是那樣子啦。於是我同那些壯健的青年們回來，在園地上拔草了。」</p>
<p>「我佩服你的勇氣和實際的靈敏」術士說。「但是我却没有生得這樣。」</p>
<p>「這等性質你用不着佩服的，」亞拉伯人說。「這我覺得有些慚愧啦。凡有沙漠上的言長。不是都將這些性質表顯得出色的麽？我對於自己所看重的是在我的心靈的超越，這是使我成爲神的靈感的媒介的。你可曾著過書？」</p>
<p>「没有」術士悲哀地說。「我巴不得自己有這能力，那就我錢賺得多，儘可以脫離這個討厭的十字架少將我的使命刋印出來，傳布於全世了。然而我却不是什麽著作家。我編過一種簡易的祈禱文，其中，我想也許有着各種的精華罷。然而神給我的却是講話的靈感，不是著作的靈感。」一</p>
<p>「著作這事情是有用的」亞拉伯人說。「我得了靈感，將上帝的話冩了許多章，他的名眞得頌揚呀！然而這個世界上却也有一班人，要望上帝費心來照顧他們，是辦不到的。他的話對於他們没有什麽意義；因此每逢我不得不對付他們的時候，我就不復受到靈感，只得得依靠我自己的發明和我自己的機智了。我爲他們寫種種可怕的故事，有的關於最後審判日，有的關於作惡者在那裏要永遠受苦的地獄。我將這些恐怖對照着爲遵行上帝的意志的人們而設的天堂的勝景。就是會引誘他們的這一種天堂，你懂得罷！就是有着花園呀，芳香呀美女呀的天堂。」</p>

<p>掉期亦因期標跌風猛烈、同業舉止失措、無　暇關心、是以少有　、式成交、惟有盈豐恒曾貼予大德成七十條、價計十五兩、（一四月）誠屬意外、三月份條額至四日止、尚剩一千五百十九條、</p>

<p>某一次，我奉公差遣。，往江北某縣去走了一遭。從上海辦公處出發。共計利用過電車，火車、馬車，過江的渡輪船，汽車人力車，内河小輪，獨輪小車，軲渡船，划子船等十種交通工具。末了，從划子船上岸，雇了一乘三個圓顱方趾的人，輪流着抬走的綠呢小官轎，一路　　喝喝地進城，路人都避讓不遑，側目而視。我安坐轎中，目空一切，十分威武。</p>
<p>生天拐着二條孤拐兒，不拘風霜雨雪，在辦公處與亭子樓住宅的距離間，在上千上萬的人叢裏擠的我，想起了那一回利用了十一種不同時代的交通工具物質的享用，雖然這已不是簇嶄新鮮的一回事，也不得不刳出我的心香一瓣，謳歌着上下古今數千年，南北東西數萬里之内的一切科學家，廢寢忘餐的發明，一切大匠們，辛苦勤勞地，製造出這許多交通工具來，給我們享用。而同時呢，對於努力保存國粹兼愛採用洋貨的純中國種同胞，更感激得屁滾尿流。假使中國不是中國的話，二十世紀的人們，恐怕很少能夠在三四天内，很有秩序的享用這許多物質文明，因爲有許多東西，西方文明國人，早已廢棄不用了。這一點，或許誰都不能笑話的。因爲發明飛機的大科學家，或許還一世比不上我那一遭所坐的種類的之多，雖然我從來滑搭乘過賴以救國的飛機。</p>

<p>那年大通航業公司「新大明」遭日本商船「厚田」丸誤行航綫故意撞擊，聽說罹難的接江，有七八人之多，他們本可以爲避逸意外危險，相率不登輪遠走數十里去接客，可是爲了營業競爭，依然在水上搶着解决麵包問題。</p>

<p>— 張恨水</p>
<p>第一回　推食殷勤偏邀貧女憶　人們慷慨别具武夫雄</p>
<p>到了天快黑的時候，甘家的聽差，就拿了一個瓷鼓子來，站在院子外呌道：老太，你們家小米粥熬得了嗎？我們二爺，讓我們盛稀飯來着。江氏心裏可就納悶，我們家熬稀飯，怎麽他都會知道了？便答道：熬得了，來盛了去罷。早由老姑娘接着瓷鼓子到屋子裏來，滿滿的盛上一鼓子稀飯，雙手捧着送了出去。江氏在裏面，聽到伊還輕輕的道：這稀飯是我自己打水洗的米，很乾凈的，我不知道你們二爺要吃鹹的還是吃甜的，没有給買鹹菜。江氏如此聽着，就知道今天下午所以家裏突然熬稀飯的原由了。老姑娘進屋來了，江氏只當不知道，點上一盞燈，放在坑頭邊一張桌子上，依然作伊的事，老姑娘道：媽，你不吃稀飯吧？我給你撑一碗麵條吃罷。江氏道：煑了稀飯，爲什麽做麵吃？老姑娘道：因爲我知道你不愛喝小米粥。江氏道：你旣然知道我不愛喝小米粥爲什麽又熬上這樣一大鍋呢？這樣一說，不駁得老姑娘無辭可措的了，只是微笑着。伊忙着將爐子上的鍋端下來，又把爐子送進坑眼裏去，盛着兩碗稀飯，把抽屜裏一碗冷的鹽水疙疸絲兒。一齊都放在桌上，然後將一把破椅子，拖得靠了桌子，扶起筷子，先夾了兩根疙疸絲兒在嘴裏慢慢的咀嚼着。江氏道：你也不愛喝小米粥不是？若是給甘二爺熬着，就别熬那麽些个。老姑娘低了頭，手端着粥碗就了嘴唇，慢慢的呷着。江氏覺得這一句話，或者有些令女兒難堪，便道：天下事眞是難說，闊人家吃膩了鷄鴨魚肉，倒想喝小米粥，我們這吃膩了小米粥的人家，想吃一頓包餃子都吃不着呢。正說到這裏，聽到外面院子裏有脚步響，問了了吏誰？就有人笑道：是我，没什麽事，和你們家道謝來了。說畢，他已走了。這就是甘二爺說的。江氏笑道：老是這麽着，一提就到。幸而我們没有說。二爺什麽壞話，要說什麽壞話，讓人聽見了，眞會生出是非來。老姑娘道：甘二爺倒不是那種人，不會記掛什麽小事的。江氏因女兒這樣的說着，旣不和女兒閙什麽意見。這話也就不必說了。</p>

<h3 id="c260">泰山頂上觀日出小記 <a href="#c260" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e260" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">260</a></h3>
<p>— 萍草</p>
<p>泰山頂上觀日出，是我很久以前聽慣了的美量；泰頂日出的實際情形，是我去年纔得到的經歷，秋天的九月中旬，我同一位友人費了半天的氣力，終於在日落的時候爬到山頂了。周圍的荒凉，使你會疑心是走進了一座鬼門關的死鎭。陰風峭急，捲着陣尖銳的呌嘯。在烟霧朦朧崗巒起伏中，露出幾座廟宇的殷紅尖頂，他有間斷的幾聲寺鐘，纔告訴你這山頂上還有一種隱僻的人類。</p>
<p>我們對着那個最大的殷紅尖頂。又爬了約有一里的路程。纔到那座廟宇的旁邊，登上了幾層石階，可以看見大門樓壁上「碧霞宫」三個大字。向裏望去，窕然一洞深黑，最裏面有盞燈光，淡黄的光，照耀着一個綉花的帷幔，兩邊站一些牛頭鬼怪的金人。香爐内飄着裊裊的烟。門檻，棟壁，都現出隱的輪廓，這是一個神殿。我們看着這種陰森的景物，彷彿置身在山鬼精靈的巢穴。一陣冷風吹來，不禁毛髮爲豎，懍然戰慄。我們正在躊躇的當兒，忽地裏邊竄出一頭狗，汪汪地呌了幾聲，隨後跟了一個僧人向我們打招呼，我們緩算鬆過一口氣來。</p>
<p>國爲一天爬山的疲乏，吃過僧人預備的齋飯，吩咐了僧人明早到看日出的時候喚醒我們後，便怱怱睡了。</p>
<p>第二天天還没明，我們都醒了，没等到僧人喚，就起來向日觀亭走去。雲雪漫漫，對面不能見人，循石路以登，大風刮得使人喘不過氣來。足下黑雲密布，頭頂上閃着幾顆寒星。東邊的雲層，忽然一線彩色，慢慢染成彩霞，在霞光閃耀中，裂出一道紅痕，愈放愈大，立刻變成弓形，像掙扎似地霍霍跳了幾下，猛可的跳出來一個圓滿龐大的赤輪，下面的紅光，倐起倐落，摇晃了一陣，慢慢的見彩色殘退了。據說紅光是東海裏的海水，太陽是從海中洗澡出來的。這固然是神話式的傳說，但伊那種清潔鮮艶的形態，的確很像一個充滿熱情的出浴美人。</p>
<p>赤輪升起，雲霧漸消，只有風還是照樣地狂吹。日觀亭上的石碑，已隱隱可辨，摩挲讀之，知係清乾隆的御碑。雖年代不遠，而星霜剥蝕，風雨摧殘，字襄行間，大半已不能認識。我們仍照舊路歸來，過玉皇頂，觀李斯的封禪碑。日觀亭附近的古跡，青帝宫，元君宫，東嶽廟，孔子廟，桃花洞，魯班洞等處，都一一涉歷。回到碧霞宫時，僧人已經擺上早晨的齋飯。在吃飯的時候，他談了不少山中的情形。最使他感慨的，是近幾年游山的人减少，他廟裘香火錢的减收，比從前相差一倍，而當地政府，又按期征發香火捐。我們給過食住錢臨走的時候，日影正掛在殿前一株蒼松的樹梢。</p>

<p>電通七日東京電　中島商相接到美國禁金出口之報、語記者曰、日美匯市、聞日本暗盤、已到二十六美金、則漲至三十美金、爲意中事、結果對輸出入、影響必大、美國如脫離金本位制、德國姑作别論、法國必難維持金本位制、荷蘭亦然、若全世界禁金出口、則國際貿易、必置於特殊關係之上、目下惟有靜觀事態之推移、其一時的實行禁金出口、恐將繼續相當期間、</p>
<p>電通七日東京電　關於美國金融恐慌及於日本紡織業之影響、日清紗廠社長宫島清次郎語人曰、日本紡織業、雖因美國禁金出口、受甚大之影響、然大局的無用悲觀、日幣暴騰、棉花跌價、誠受捐失、然乃一時的、且爲額不大、日匯暴漲誠足阻止輸出、然競爭國之英國、磅價必漲、故無悲觀之必要、</p>

<h3 id="c304">爲湯玉麟呼寃　吾 <a href="#c304" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e304" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">304</a></h3>
<p>「承德失陷，湯玉麟不戰而逃」像這樣的特號大字，在報紙上刺入了我們的眼　，一般愛國志士，誰不捶胞跥足，誰不想將他抓將過來，碎屍萬斷，甚至以「不抵抗主義」而聞名天下的張同志，也不免大發雷霆而「下令緝捕湯玉麟，如果就逮，必加槍决，以正國法」。果然義正詞嚴，堂皇正大，於是我們老百姓便不能不相信張少帥同志果然是「抗日先鋒」，果然是「國家柱石」，免不了更要「節衣縮食」，「毁家紓難」，將自己財産的萬分之一，努力輸將的電匯到順承王府，而懇求他爲國捐軀。從此聚腋成裘，抗日成功，大有希望。將來還有做香烟廣告之可能。</p>
<p>湯玉麟老混蛋也就是打聽清楚了只要「宣言」抗日便有馬卡馬卡的進賬，於是在做了一年　多宣統駕下的王公大臣之餘，也說是要「戰鬥到底」了。但是日帝主義竟不肯由他脚踏兩邊船，而老走狗當然也不願弄假成眞，於是低頭一想，計上心來，立刻打疊細軟，綑載上車，而報紙上所謂之「不戰而逃」，在他却是捐讓主人了。</p>
<p>由此觀之，他的「宣言抵抗」和「不戰而逃」，本是救國大計中所規劃得清清楚楚的，大花面進一步，小花臉便退兩步，早已在舞台後面商量得明明白白的，何况他是「不抵抗主義」之嫡系承繼者，當然得恪守家風。然而國人竟不能原諒，丢開提線的不駡而駡木頭人。張同志可以將東北三省送給爺爺做禮物，反成爲黨國要人，而湯玉麟僅僅是效法前人送了一省，便要「逮捕」「槍决」，眞是太媽媽的了。</p>
<p>然而湯玉麟之該死，總是毫無疑義的囉，何况張同志亦於捫心自問之後而說他該遭槍斃，所以他的罪大惡極，也就可想而知。同時我們現在總算又多得了一次嚴重的敎訓；要懇求這般軍閥大爺來替我們反帝國主義，那眞是有如請盜禦盜，而且爲了徹底反帝起見，必須以我們大衆自己的力量，將這般狗東西完全肅清，然後才能在反帝的民族革命戰爭中得着最後的勝利。</p>

<p>— 冷梅</p>
<p>從前，我在本刋中看見過一篇「天然漆」，因而聨想到這重要的「人造漆」。人造漆之主要原料爲桐油。歐美各國，從前在未有　桐油輸入以前，每用胡麻子油爲原料，但其産品較桐油製成之人造漆爲不堅固與不易乾。以桐油爲原料而製成之人造漆，其質地旣佳，又甚堅固易乾，且能防水。與天然漆不相上下。</p>
<p>（一）種類丨人造漆之種類甚多。大概可分三種：（甲）陽性人造漆“Ｌong　oil”Varnish其中桐油成分較多。（乙）中性人造漆“Ｍediun　Oill”Varnish其中桐油之成分居中。（丙）陰性人造漆“Ｓhort　Oil　Varnish其中桐油之成分較少。以上三種，各有　其特殊之用途。陽性人造漆爲室外之用。中性人造漆爲地板之用。陰性人造漆爲室内之用　。</p>
<p>（二）原料丨陽性，中性，陰性三種人造漆之原料配合量如下：</p>
<p>甲，陽性人造漆</p>
<p>樹脂　一百磅如用松香一百磅須加石灰十磅。）</p>
<p>桐油　三十五加侖</p>
<p>醋酸銅　三磅半</p>
<p>醋酸　　一磅</p>
<p>松節油或礦油　五十加侖</p>
<p>乙，中性人造漆</p>
<p>樹脂一百磅、</p>
<p>桐油　十八加侖</p>
<p>醋酸鉛　二磅</p>
<p>醋酸鈷　半磅</p>
<p>松節油　三十三加侖</p>
<p>丙，陰性人造漆</p>
<p>樹脂一百磅</p>
<p>桐油十二加侖</p>
<p>醋酸鉛　一磅</p>
<p>醋酸鈷　四分之一磅</p>
<p>松節油　二十七加侖</p>
<p>桐油　，樹脂爲人造漆之主要原料，醋酸鉛及醋酸鈷爲助乾劑。松節油或礦油爲稀薄劑。</p>
<p>（三）器具丨祇需漆鍋與脂缸二座。漆鍋須以鍋製，容量約一百加侖。鍋底須裝以進退自如之活動輪。脂缸，用桐樹製成，高三尺，直徑尺半。</p>
<p>（四）製造丨先將樹脂溶化，（其溶點需於華氏四百度之下）與桐油同置於漆鍋中，用猛火加熱至五百度，保持數小時，待得適宜之固結度，纔後熄火。至熱度降至三百度時，即加松節油等稀薄劑稀薄之。</p>
<p>樹脂之溶點如超過四百度時，須先將樹脂與小量之桐油溶於脂缸，然後與其餘之桐油混合，此油亦須先燒至五百度。</p>
<p>（五）檢騐丨檢騐人造漆之佳劣，可置漆一小滴於玻璃片上·如呈透明，即能顯示桐油與樹脂已完全和合，以手指延之成線，此線約長一尺，最佳者，能伸長二三尺。</p>

<p>— 克夫</p>
<p>二房東的亭子樓空了，租給了一位大學畢業學士頭的人物，他除了有了文憑没有職業之外，還有一個如花般美的妻。他們的租房子是打破了上海的記錄，租半個月。</p>
<p>這也是那位慈悲的二房東太太的好心，因爲這樣漂亮的西裝人物說：</p>
<p>「······我想在上海謀事，如果再半月没希望，我們要回家了，所以只想租半個月！」</p>
<p>「是啊！出門人總有　困難；那麽就這樣吧，一月七塊錢租金，半月算了四塊錢吧！」</p>
<p>「······」他便摸出一塊定洋。</p>
<p>下午搬進了，這是一個學士的妻，是上海最時式樣子的紅衣女郎！</p>
<p>夜晚了，亭子樓裏充滿了調笑的聲浪。</p>
<p>「先生丨這位是······」二房東推開亭子樓門問。</p>
<p>「她啊，她是我的内人！」</p>
<p>「哦！多好！先生睡了，請把電火」熄了！「曉得」！他說「坐坐去吧」！二房東太太便退了出來說「不！你們好自在了」！</p>
<p>第二天早晨，那紅衣女郎去了，晚上没有回來。那學士一人在樓上裏的打汽燈上燒飯。</p>
<p>「先生！你的少奶奶什麽今天這時還不回來呢」？二房東又推進去問。</p>
<p>「喔！她哪！她是在ＸＸ中學讀書，今夜住在校裏了！這學士如此說：</p>
<p>「晤！原來是這樣啊」！</p>
<p>「·················」</p>
<p>「眞是新人物」！二房東太太退了出來自言自語的樓下去了。</p>
<h3 id="c308">學校中的處世藝術 <a href="#c308" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e308" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">308</a></h3>
<p>— 漫</p>
<p>前幾天看見貴刋上的「處世藝術」，我們在學校裏的小夥子，不免心養養地，也來談談我們學校中的「處世藝術」。，「交遊廣闊」可以算我們學校裏處世藝術的天經地義：就是你要無論和上中下三級先生（上級：如校長，訓育主任，及自己授課的先生等。中級：如體育指導。下級：如庶務會計之輩。）上中下三級學生，（上級：那些活像紅頭阿三，黑臉，穿燈籠袴子的運動員。中級：那些足不出户，考第一名的書獃子。下級：那些低級裏的水鬼。）直至校内的茶房，和外面那些小店裏的老板娘止，你得都要和他們親近親近；至於親近的方法，却不外乎「風」「馬」「牛」三種最高的處世藝術。譬如：你要親近那些敎員，就得請他們吃棹酒席，或是送上幾只銀盾；假如那位先生歡喜吸烟，就得買上幾罐三五牌至少要茄力克。總之要有孔必䟎，隨其所即的送上。如果要和那些運動員親近，就得跟他們戴上同樣的紅帽子，穿上燈籠袴，你覺到你臉上不黑，可以抓把泥望臉上一抹；閒時請幾匣美麗牌，或是添幾只菜。至於要親近那些用功的，（）凡用功學生窮者佔多數你就得吹得天花亂墜，譬如你姓蔣，你就說蔣主席是你的爺叔，看看不大像，至可你總要說是我本家，畢業後可以給他們找事，至少也是個縣長，無條件的他們自會同你親近。還有你如果有一技之長，你非大大的賣弄不可，譬如你會踢足球，就得穿上足球鞋，站在操塲上頑幾脚，你會演說，時常就得辦出你的口才。或是你會寫點大作，就得辨張壁報。如果你一樣不會，而只命吃飯的話，你每頓必得吃七八碗，緊管你肚子漲得要破，你總要落個「吃飯大王」的名氣，呌大家注意你。</p>
<p>如果你照這樣做到了「交遊廣闊」之後。其中的好處自不必說；譬如你和那些先生親近之後，逢到大考的時候，你就考得不大好的話，他總會給你個七十分；如果你嫌飯廳上菜不好，怒氣冲天的摜了幾只碗，當然訓育先生也不會看見了就記過。和體育指導親近，也可以來個什麽球，或什麽隊，出出風頭。和戴紅帽子的親近、可以和人打架、可以耀武揚威。和書獃子親近，可以呌他在考試的時Ｐass，自己却可以去睡覺。和小鬼們親近，可以呌他們替你做來，和老板娘親近，放假時可少　還幾塊錢······</p>
<p>總之在學校裏懂得學校裏的處世藝術的人，可以做大享，可以打人······不懂得學校裏處世藝術的人，祗能做小鬼。</p>

<p>— 潘敏愼</p>
<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>表妹某，年未二十，而文君新寡；無所出，翁姑而外，尚有伯叔三人。夫族家道小康，但尚未析産，妯娌相處，積不相能，大有不堪同居之慨。現在翁姑在世，尚可勉强維持，一旦兩老物古，勢必全無依靠，母族又非富有，正所謂後顧茫茫，來日大難。照新人物看來丨如此情形，當然改嫁可耳。但她的四週，與他自己本身，都是受過舊禮敎洗禮的人，所以這改嫁兩個字，她絶對不會想到；匹夫不可奪志，傍人也就不能啓齒了。現在她因爲想到前途的黑暗，終日愁眉不展，玉容消門；叨在至戚的我，實在覺得不能再袖手旁觀了。請問孀媳對於舅姑的財産，有没有要求分析之權：她的妝奩首飾，現在已入翁姑之手，可不可以要求返還？先生，上面的問題、似乎出了店員通訊範圍以外，但我的確是一個店員呀丨請你賜個答復罷，（下略）　潘敏愼謹上</p>
<p>ＸＸＸＸ</p>
<p>編者按：人之所以異於禽獸者，因其須過精神生活也；一個人單有了物質的亨用，决不會感到滿足的；他必定同時需要精神上的慰藉。潘君的表妹，丈夫是死了，夫婦之愛，倡隨之樂，當然無望；並且因爲没有子女的緣故，也不能像其他寡婦一樣，將全部精神，移轉到母性愛上頭去。在這種情形之下；即使他物質方面，已有相當解决，我們也不能不勸她改嫁；何况她來日大難呢丨所以我們還勸潘君轉勸她，終以改嫁爲是。匹夫不能奪志，誠然是不差的；不過在勸的程度，還没有到强的程度，是談不到奪字的呀！你又何必不能啓齒呢</p>
<p>現行法令，規定家長財産，子女不得要求分析；但有特别情形者，許其通融。如「寡媳之於舅姑，嫡子之於庶母，其已情同陌路，勢難强合者，准其析産分居」。現在潘君的表妹，與舅姑相處，看來尚不至「情同陌路，勢難强合」的程度；但伯叔妯娌之間，倘有確實證據，足以證明有急謀日後生活保障之必要者，也可提出析産之要求。至於妝奩首飾，爲她私有財産，絶對有要求返還的權利。</p>

<p>但現在新紐蘭，紐約和其他銷售硬煤的中心市塲暴發了燃料競爭之後，立刻就發生了影響。硬煤的礦廠每星期只有三天或四天的工作了。洗煤所及露天煤坑都被停工了，機器也都不動了。很多的工人都感覺到現在的情况還不如幹拾煤，劈木柴運煤的工作好呢。</p>
<p>同時，經理和上頭愈發地苛刻而傲慢了。每天在包脫斯凡里的總公司中發下新的命令，如裁員，减少木料，實行作工而不給工錢的「死工」，舊時不履行的規則，現在都逐一地實行了，如吸烟，領工錢後的翌日請了假，或是向工頭辯答，都犯了開除的嚴規了。</p>
<p>「煤賤」的呼聲普遍了各地。「我們現在必須對煤油和軟煤競爭。」經理這樣的說。「礦工一定要和我們合作，克服這競爭，恢復我們已失的市塲。那是我們公共的鬥爭丨釀我們實行那訂明在契約中「合作及效力」的方針丨每一個人盡他的一部分力量來挽救這硬煤事業······」</p>
<p>許多銷煤的城市中正在舉行會議：在那裏出席的各地礦經理和工會代表，都贊成減少礦廠的開支。他們帶着高領，繫着寛大的領結，穿着禮服，表示他們在旅館中生活的敵意：他們說很流利的話，預言那過了長久的和平必會恢復硬煤的威信。礦廠的經理們主張：「我們一定不可再罷工，我們一定要堅守我們的市塲丨工人和公司職員一定要一致地注意公共利益。」</p>
<p>聽了這些話後，那班工會代表丨貧苦出身而現在還不脫他們那種微賤神氣的代表，很肯定而奸滑的回答說」全部的事業似乎都有些可疑吧。」</p>

<p>— 草</p>
<p>寳座被奪，葛雷泰其速歸來！</p>
<p>葛雷泰嘉寳歸赴瑞典之初，好萊塢誰曾聽到過凱絲玲海濱Katharene　Hepburn的名字；「棄夫」没有正式公映之前，美國人雖曾意料到會有這麽一個偉大的「新發現」;如今「棄夫」已當選爲十大鉅片之一，凱絲玲海濱的成績與約翰擺里摩亞同躋於榮譽的尖端，誰還不知道這新發現，「美國嘉寳」凱絲玲海濱？</p>
<p>這麽個綽號是這麽得到的：當「棄夫」試映的時候，那班見到她的高縱的顴骨，以及富於情感的面貌，活像離去的嘉寳同一模型中製造出來的一般；同時，</p>
<p>她亦富有神秘性，害怕說話，更害怕觀衆們的追逐，因此，神經過敏的新聞記者們，像給祖國發見了新大陸一般喧傳着說他們已發現了國貨的嘉寳！</p>
<p>其實，牠不僅在人多時害怕說話。在涉足好萊塢的第一天，這位新的神秘女郎便和嘉寳一般在電影記者們之追逐下，百計的逃避一般攝影機的射照，便是雷電華公司的宣傳部也總得不到一些代牠宣傳的資料，還是從别處查悉：牠是二十四歲，是富家之女。</p>
<p>葛雷泰嘉寳所以號稱神秘，就因爲不肯宣佈自己的一切，如今嘉寳「神秘」的寳座已被她所奪。但，這這位年青的，淺棕色頭髮的少女，却另有自創的座位，像十二月份的電影雜志Ｍotion　Pioture公舉她爲明星時的讚語說：</p>
<p>我們認爲她是偉大的明星丨</p>
<p>因爲她是一九三年明星的忠實典型　青年，富有天才與經騐而有煥然燦爛的個性。因爲她是富寳的後裔，演　　　　爲她愛好，不是必需的。因爲她是銀幕上從來未見的温雅女性。因爲她曾受舞台的訓練以及最高學府的敎育。因爲她是「創作」的，不模仿銀幕上任何人的扮相。</p>
<p>美國嘉寳凱絲琳海嬪在「棄夫」（Ａ　　ill　　　Ｄivorcement）中表演之一斑</p>

<h3 id="c314">評「春風楊柳」 <a href="#c314" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e314" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">314</a></h3>
<p>— 玉虹</p>
<p>在這金錢萬能的宇寅中，就是號稱神聖的男女「變愛」，雖說是無條件，無目標的；但實際也逃不出金錢的範圍。不過金錢是否足以維持永遠的愛情？這是一個問題。「春風楊柳」也就是根據此</p>
<p>點而作。述一個迷信金錢的女子，以金錢爲愛情的目標，曾三易其夫，兩棄其子，終乃落花無主，猶如楊柳之折於春風，其立意及取材，都有可取之處。不過事實是太乖巧，而太嫌虛僞了，有爲事實所不能之處，</p>
<p>關於表情方面都是很生冷的，飾債主的桑秀英，簡直在那作導演的傀儡戲，不過朝蘭根雖是一個滑稽配角，但尚很可取，言語方面，也很牽强，除了楊耐梅外，都是捲了舌尖硬撇，於大學中行畢業禮的一幕佈景也太簡單了。</p>
<p>最後說到發音問題，因爲這是結果好尚，不過我們不能就此滿意，還希望竺清賢先生繼續努力，總要能超過舶來</p>
<p>品才好。</p>
<h3 id="c315">我對於「狂流」的批評 <a href="#c315" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e315" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">315</a></h3>
<p>— 紅</p>
<p>轟動一時的「狂流」·終於和我們見面了。它運用現實的題材，把前年中國各省的大水災，作爲描寫的背景，寫出了農民羣衆的被壓逼，與劣紳的罪惡。但是，我們覺得編劇者在這「狂流」中，硬嵌進這麽一個戀愛的故事，實在是太無謂了。因爲這麽一來，不但是减少了「狂流」的力，而且使人對這個故事的現實，起了懐疑。</p>
<p>導演者在「狂流」中，雖然有很多新的技術供戲，但，有幾個應該着力描寫的地方，却悄然放它過去，實在是可惜很很；水災的景，雖則是剪接得很不錯，但到底是太多了。舞場的穿插，似乎有些畫蛇添足。</p>
<p>在這「狂流」中的人物，龔稼農的劉鐵生，是成功的。夏佩珍的素貞，祗有當她在告訴傅秀娟，劉鐵生收留她的經過時的回述，幾個鏡頭做得最好。胡蝶傅秀娟，在上半部很好，下半部的表情未免太過火。王獻齋的李和卿，雖然没有譚志遠的傅柏仁那樣大的火氣，却也很夠了。</p>

<p>— 趙鵬</p>
<p>日本的映畫會社，（影片公司）都由外務省供給巨額的津貼。他們所攝的影片，像下列幾種：（一）國家體面的映片，像日本飛機隊，日本陸戰隊，海軍兵艦，海軍會操等映片，這些都是表現他們國家的强盛，和威嚴。（二）民間生活的映片，像日本現在的産業工塲，敎育，運動等映片，都表示他們國家各種事業的發達。（三）國際性的映片。這些映片最可惡，他們派了許多攝影員到中國來，將各地的風景地勢暗地　拍去。故意僱了許多演員，扮出中國許多内戰的情形，編成英法各國的文字！分送世界各國，暗示中國是無組織的國家。國聨調查團經過日本的時候，特别攝製了許多日本文武官員招待調查團的影片，使各國對他們表示相當的好感。其他像滿洲國的各項事業，他們都攝製了影片，放送到各國去。除了以上的各種影片以外，關於愛情，社會，新聞，等影片，都要經過官廳嚴密的檢查和取締。綜而言之，日本的各種影片，都含有　宣傳的成分。</p>

<p>她已明白了丨一切的希望都消滅了丨忽然妮塔嘉飲聲忍氣地走進屋子，對她唱唱地說：「陛下，上帝决不讓他死的！」</p>

<p>妮塔嘉抱住她一會兒，於是私語着：</p>
<p>「王后，我請了拉斯蒲丁來了······他在外面等候。他是能救他的。」</p>
<p>「拉斯蒲！」這名字在一種顫震的喘聲裏發出。便是王后也聽見過關於這人的謀叛的報告而恐懼。可是現在，再也顧不得什麽了。「快帶他進來，」她輕輕地說：</p>

<h3 id="e1">Fierce Battle Occurs Outside Xifengkou <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Wan Fulin Orders a Full-Scale Counterattack</p>
<p>The Main Force of the Japanese Army Advances Towards Luanping</p>
<p>Enemy Planes Bomb Xifengkou and Other Places</p>
<p>(Beiping) A telegram from Gubeikou reports that the enemy's Hattori Detachment, consisting of over 5,000 men, and the rebel troops of the puppet Cheng Guorui and Shao Benliang, each a regiment, launched a fierce attack on our Sanjiazi on the 5th at noon, covered by eight aircraft. They engaged in fierce fighting with our troops under Yu Zhaolin and Shen Ke at Sidaoyingzi. Wan Chengma commanded from the front. The enemy's artillery fire and bombs were extremely fierce. Although our army was threatened on three sides, they calmly fought back until late at night. Due to insufficient ammunition, they temporarily concentrated in Kuancheng. Wan's warhorse was killed. (6th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Wan Fulin ordered a full-scale counterattack this afternoon. The front line has advanced towards Dashihuiyao. Japanese planes have been bombing Xifengkou, Kuancheng, and Pingquan for several days. (6th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The vanguard of the Japanese Army's Kawahara Regiment is pressing towards Kalahetun and Qingshiliang. Today at 3 p.m., three Japanese planes bombed the highway near Kalahetun. The main force of the Japanese army is advancing towards Luanping. A major battle is expected to occur tomorrow. This afternoon, Japanese planes flew to Gubeikou for reconnaissance. Zhang Zuoxiang's troops are stationed near Gubeikou. (6th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Confirmed information: (1) Sun Dianying's detachment in Chifeng is retreating towards Weichang. (2) Chengde was abandoned yesterday (the 5th) at 10 a.m. The enemy only had over ten armored vehicles. The Rehe army never issued pay, leading to a lack of fighting spirit among the soldiers and deep resentment among the people. Therefore, they retreated without a fight. (3) Zhang Zuoxiang retreated to Gubeikou. The Central Army has already passed through Tongzhou and will join forces to launch a counterattack. (4) Zhang Xueliang invited General Zhu Ziqiao to sit in Chengde and was about to depart when he received news of the fall of Chengde. He still wanted to go but was dissuaded by his colleagues. He now plans to go to Gubeikou. The rumor that Zhu was detained is unfounded. (6th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Zhang Zuoxiang telegraphed Generals Sun Dianying, Feng Zhanhai, Cui Xingwu, and Liu Zhendong to actively reorganize and prepare for a counterattack. (6th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The enemy's Hattori Cavalry Brigade, consisting of approximately 300 men, launched an invasion from Chengde to the new position of our army at Qingshiliang, 20 li outside Gubeikou, starting at 2 a.m. this morning. They made contact with the 107th Division under Sun Zhengfang, and fierce fighting ensued. The enemy army is advancing south in successive waves, putting pressure on our army. The enemy rushed reinforcements and a tank convoy from Chengde. Fierce fighting continued at around 4 a.m. At the same time, enemy traces were discovered at Gongjiangying and Huangcaoding. The situation outside Gubeikou is extremely tense. Our army has constructed solid fortifications in Kalahetun, 20 li north of Gubeikou, and in Huangcaoding and Changshanyu, south of Pingquan. All units have been fully deployed on the front line. When the enemy invades south again, a decisive battle will continue to be fought with them outside Gubeikou. He Yingqin has decided to go outside Gubeikou within the next few days to inspect and personally direct military affairs to boost morale. (6th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Our army units in Sanjiazi retreated to the new positions at Baishilazishan, Kuancheng, and Xifengkou. Wan has arrived at Xifengkou and is commanding his troops to intercept the enemy advancing south. Fighting occurred at Baishilazi and Dajigou at 1 a.m. this morning. We have built solid fortifications northeast of Xifengkou, which Wan continues to defend and command, continuing the resistance. Over ten Japanese planes conducted reconnaissance in the Xifengkou, Kuancheng, and Qingshiliang areas yesterday afternoon and dropped bombs. Fortunately, we suffered no casualties. (6th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A telegram from Gubeikou reports that the enemy's Kawahara Regiment, consisting of over 1,000 men, with over ten armored vehicles, is threatening our Gubeikou front from Luanping along the Pingquan-Rehe highway, starting at 4 a.m. The vanguard has engaged in fierce fighting with our army in the Qingshiling and Huangtuling area. At 8 a.m., two Japanese planes flew over our Daomaguan defense line outside the pass for reconnaissance. The main force of the enemy army, consisting of approximately 3,000 men, and the rebel army of Shao Benliang, a regiment, are currently concentrated in Luanping, Jinjiagou, and other places, preparing for a major invasion. Our army is currently strictly defending at Chuizishan and other places in Gubeikou. The two brigades of Yu Zhaolin and Ding Xichun, consisting of over 2,000 men, have retreated from the Sanjiazi area and arrived near Gubeikou via side roads. Wan has sent a telegram to Peiping reporting that a fierce battle occurred between our army and the enemy outside Xifengkou last night and is continuing this morning. (6th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) There have been no major changes in the Rehe situation in the past 24 hours. Official reports from the front indicate that there is still fighting in the Xifengkou area and between Chengde and Gubeikou, but these are all rearguard actions. Japanese planes continue to engage in bombing, aiming to prevent Chinese troops from entering the Chengde area. It is reported that Wan Fulin, accompanied by three officers, was riding between Pingquan and Xifengkou this afternoon when a Japanese plane dropped a bomb, which exploded 20 yards away. Wan's mount and the three accompanying officers were killed. Wan only suffered a fright and was not injured. It is now heard that Tang Yulin did indeed appear near Gubeikou. Upon hearing this, the authorities dispatched troops to arrest him, but he has vanished without a trace. (6th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Tang Yulin's troops, numbering three to four thousand, are now gathered west of Luanping, and they still have machine guns and mortars. (6th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) There is still fighting on the Rehe front today. The Chinese army in Rehe is currently retreating in three directions: one is retreating west from Chifeng into Dolun in Chahar Province, one is concentrating in Gubeikou from Chengde, and one is retreating to Xifengkou from Lingyuan. These Chinese troops are threatened by Japanese planes during their retreat, so the troops are moving extremely quickly. At the same time, Japanese planes are preventing Chinese troops from advancing towards Chengde, because the number of Japanese troops in Chengde is still small. The Japanese troops who entered Chengde yesterday received reinforcements from the Suzuki Brigade in the afternoon. Although Zhang Xueliang's army has suffered many casualties, they still have fighting spirit. They may fight fiercely again in Chengde and Gubeikou. The 60,000 Chinese troops currently concentrated in Gubeikou have been ordered to advance to a point 20 miles inside Rehe Province, and the Chinese troops retreating from Rehe are also building new positions there. This time, 20,000 of Zhang Xueliang's direct lineage troops participated in the Rehe battle. Most of these troops are now missing. Tang Yulin's troops are currently retreating in a disorganized manner, and there are many ammunition boxes that have not yet been opened or unloaded, which are being transported back by camel teams. (6th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to this morning's official announcement, Wan Fulin has established his headquarters in Kuancheng and has ordered a counterattack on Pingquan. The news of Japanese planes bombing Gubeikou and flying to Xifengkou has been confirmed. (6th Reuters Telegram) Part of the Japanese army has reached Lengkou.</p>
<p>(Beiping) Part of the enemy's Hattori Detachment has reached Lengkou. Our army is strictly defending in the Lulong and Qian'an area. (6th Special Dispatch) Yu and Ding's Brigades suffered heavy losses.</p>
<p>(Beiping) Yu Zhaolin and Ding Xichun's brigades suffered losses of three-fifths in the fierce fighting in Shaomaoshan, Lingnan, and other places for four days. The remaining 2,000 men have arrived on the Qingshiliang front to join the battle. (6th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>He and Zhang Discuss Plans to Recover Lost Territory</p>
<p>Zhang Xueliang Issues an Order to Arrest Tang Yulin</p>
<p>(Beiping) Minister of Military Affairs He Yingqin telegraphed the National Government, requesting that Tang Yulin be stripped of his post and investigated. The original telegram read: "To the National Government of the Republic of China, Executive Yuan, Military Affairs Commission: The Japanese army's invasion of Rehe has aroused nationwide indignation. For several days, although Chaoyang and Kailu were captured due to their prominent terrain, the officers and soldiers at the front have been determined to resist and have not retreated in the slightest. Upon my arrival in Peiping today, I immediately heard that Tang Yulin, Chairman of Rehe Province and Commander of the 5th Army Corps, fled west on the evening of the 3rd, while the front line was still engaged in fierce fighting and Chengde had not been attacked at all, lightly abandoning Chengde to the enemy. This not only affected the battle situation but also brought shame to the international community. If he is not severely punished immediately, how can we enforce discipline and boost morale? I implore you to immediately order Tang Yulin to be stripped of his post and severely investigated, and also request that the Control Yuan, together with the Military Affairs Commission, send personnel to thoroughly investigate to determine punishment, clarify rewards and punishments, and benefit military operations. How is this? I humbly await your instructions for implementation. He Yingqin respectfully kowtows. (Central News Agency Telegram, 6th)"</p>
<h3 id="e4">The Executive Yuan Will Discuss This Today <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) After receiving Minister He's telegram from Peiping, the Central Government was extremely indignant at Tang's abandonment of territory and harming the country. It was decided that the National Government would issue an order to arrest him and severely punish him as a warning to those who do not resist. The Executive Yuan meeting on the 7th may propose and pass a resolution to issue a clear order. As for measures to salvage the situation, the Central Government has already held thorough discussions. This concerns military affairs and cannot be announced at this time. (6th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e5">Chiang Entrusts Full Authority to He Yingqin <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Military news: Chairman Chiang Kai-shek was extremely furious upon receiving the telegram regarding the loss of Chengde. He telegraphed He Yingqin to investigate and reply so that he could severely punish the guilty. Chiang's original plan was to order the troops in North China to firmly defend Rehe on the one hand, and to clear the remaining bandits in Jiangxi Province within one or two months, end the bandit suppression military operations, and then transfer troops north to personally supervise the anti-Japanese war. However, Tang fled without a fight, affecting the overall military situation and making the original plan impossible to implement, with enormous impact both domestically and internationally. It is heard that in addition to his indignation, Chiang, in order to salvage the Rehe situation and facilitate military planning at the front, has entrusted He Yingqin with full representative authority, allowing him to be stationed in North China to negotiate everything with Zhang in the vicinity, striving for a counterattack to recover the lost territory as soon as possible. He himself will wait until the bandit suppression is concluded, and if necessary, he can personally go north. (6th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e6">Tang Bears Full Responsibility for the Loss of Rehe <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) A certain committee member said that the reasons for the defeat in Rehe this time are numerous, but the crux of the matter lies in Tang Yulin's lack of determination to resist Japan, his peacetime mentality of preserving the territory and protecting the people, and his lack of the courage to kill the enemy for the country. Therefore, there were already rumors at that time that Tang was compromising with Japan. In order to understand the truth and encourage his anti-Japanese spirit, the Central Government sent Song and Zhang to Chengde to meet with Tang and discuss everything. At that time, Tang expressed his oath to defend the territory to the death and not lag behind others. Therefore, the Central Government believed that although we were not sure of victory in the Rehe war, we could hold it firmly, and the Japanese invaders would not easily succeed. Now, Tang abandoned the city and fled before the enemy arrived, causing the overall military situation to be affected. Tang should bear full responsibility for this defeat. (6th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>Continuing to Resist the Japanese Army</p>
<p>Telegraphing and Hoping the Central Government Will Find a Way to Rescue Them</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Sun Dianying telegraphed Nanjing at Shen time (3-5 p.m.) on the 5th, stating, "Our army arrived near Chifeng today. Before deployments were settled, the situation suddenly changed. In addition, a certain Righteous Army unit was unrighteous, and friendly forces were not friendly, resulting in a hasty encounter in battle, with enemies on three sides. Fortunately, the officers and soldiers fought desperately, and were still able to recapture the key locations of Cheshuipo, Jianchangyingzi, and others in an isolated and dangerous environment, engaging in hand-to-hand combat. Now that Chengde has been lost and Lingyuan and Jianping are in imminent danger, supplies of grain and ammunition have been cut off, and the isolated army is facing the enemy, threatened from all sides, but the officers and soldiers show no fear in spirit, cheering and enthusiastically killing the enemy. And for four days, wind and snow have been raging, sometimes sweating profusely, sometimes with ice covering the whole body. Without bullets, we can still engage in hand-to-hand combat; without food, it is indeed pitiful. In short, if Heaven preserves China, it will surely preserve Rehe; if Heaven preserves Rehe, it will surely preserve our army. If the officers and soldiers have not all sacrificed, then Rehe has not been completely lost. Those who surrender to the enemy are not human beings; those who assist the rebels have the hearts and livers of birds and beasts. Your brother swears this to himself, and also uses this to comfort the people of the country. However, given the current environment of this army, I sincerely hope that the Central Government will find a way to rescue us. If only we have food, we will definitely resist to the death to fulfill our duties and comfort the people of the country, etc." (6th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Sun Dianying reported from Chuizishan that on the morning of the 6th, he led the Ding and Liu Brigades to move from Weichang to the Chuizishan area, continuing to fight against a part of the Japanese Army's Mogi Cavalry Brigade. The Japanese are using aircraft and armored vehicles to assist in the battle, and the artillery fire is fierce. Two regimental commanders, someone and someone, were killed in action. (6th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The person in charge of Sun Dianying's office in Nanjing said that Sun's troops, numbering over 30,000, are currently retreating west of Chifeng and are in strict formation awaiting orders for a counterattack, and will definitely not retreat easily. Because Sun's army participated in the anti-Japanese war voluntarily, requesting permission from the Central Government and the North China Military Affairs Branch, and although they have fought bloody battles with the Japanese, their strength has not suffered any major losses. Since Kailu, Lingyuan, Chaoyang, Chengde, Chifeng, and other places have successively fallen, after Tang Yulin retreated without a fight, the entire army has been trapped in an enemy encirclement on three sides, but they are still waiting in strict formation. If the Central Government orders a counterattack and at the same time dispatches troops to assist, then they will definitely fight to the death with the enemy. What is most needed at present is the supply of armaments and provisions. (6th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Sun Dianying's troops are still defending Weichang and seizing opportunities to counterattack. The authorities in Peiping have taken measures to provide assistance. (6th Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e14">Lament for the Gloom of Rehe <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>Since Jinzhou and Yi County successively fell into enemy hands, only the Volunteer Army remained in northern Manchuria, fighting a difficult war for more than a year. The three northeastern provinces have been ravaged by enemy cavalry, and the means of transportation are completely in the hands of the enemy. The two branch lines from Dagushan to Tongliao and from Jinzhou to Beipiao are particularly important, because the Japanese army in the north can follow the Liao River westward to control Kailu, and in the south, it can attack Chaoyang from Beipiao. Therefore, the danger of Rehe did not begin today, nor did it begin this year, but was already evident after the fall of Jinzhou and Yi County and the failure to defend northern Manchuria. How could those in authority not know this situation? Moreover, defending Rehe is militarily small enough to provide supplies to the Volunteer Army, and to shake the unsteady authority of the puppet state, and large enough for our country to use force to recover the Northeast, and can also directly attack the back with a surprise force. However, for more than a year, our Northeast authorities have made no arrangements. Once the enemy army came to attack, they retreated in succession, abandoning Rehe like an old shoe in a week.</p>
<p>The person responsible for the overall military affairs of North China has shifted the blame to the Volunteer Army, blaming them for not firing a single shot. In fact, the essence of the Volunteer Army is not a regular force that directly confronts the enemy, but a guerrilla force, which everyone knows. Moreover, modern international warfare must have a complete plan. The Northeast Volunteer Army has no pay, no clothing, and endures hunger and cold, holding a small number of corrupt and dilapidated weapons to fight against an enemy with superior soldiers and sufficient food. In extreme hardship, they勉強撑持 for more than a year. All they rely on is flesh and blood. Even if they have not all been able to die for their country, their will is commendable and their actions are admirable. They are far from comparable to Tang Yulin, who usually boasted of his troops, but fled at the sight of the enemy. Tang is not to blame, but who is it that entrusted Tang with the responsibility of defending Rehe?</p>
<p>The Japanese army's invasion of the Northeast originally intended to solve its current economic panic and seek a new economic balance. However, after it encompassed the three northeastern provinces, internal contradictions became increasingly apparent. Therefore, it further invaded and occupied Rehe. With the wealth of coal, iron, and other reserves in the Northeast, it has not helped Japan's economic panic. Rehe's wool cannot stop Japan's greed. Moreover, the enemy's methods of enticement are endless, and they also use elite weapons as support. Therefore, after the fall of Chengde, Luanping was also abandoned successively, and Gubeikou is in danger of being invaded. I fear that the problem in the future is that Xifengkou and Lengkou will be small. The danger on the front is probably in Peiping and Tianjin, and the enemy on the side will be in Dolun.</p>
<p>Even if the Japanese leaders consider their national strength and do not blindly advance, or think that the relationship between Peiping and Tianjin is complicated, the Japanese army may not dare to provoke lightly, causing international disputes. But everyone knows that the countries of Britain and the United States today are exhausted and moaning in the midst of the economic panic. The financial panic in the United States began in Michigan and has now spread throughout the United States. It is already very difficult for the new American government to overcome this panic. How can it care about the Far East? Therefore, if we still want to rely on others to mediate diplomatically and缓和 the Japanese army's blind advance, it is even more futile than climbing a tree to catch fish or drinking poison to quench thirst. For the survival of the nation, we should immediately abandon all illusions and engage in a real war of strength, opening a bloody path with iron fists. Do not be discouraged, do not be discouraged, and bravely move forward, only then will there be room for survival.</p>

<p>America Bans Gold Exports to Resolve Financial Crisis</p>
<p>De Facto Abandonment of the Gold Standard Affects Markets Worldwide</p>
<p>President Orders Banks to Close Until Friday, Grants Government Special Powers to Manage National Currency, and Convenes Special Congress to Draft Relief Bill</p>
<p>(New York) President Roosevelt today issued an order granting the government absolute control over the nation's gold supply. The order also announced a ban on gold and silver exports, a ban on gold payments to foreign countries, and the closure of all banks in the United States until Thursday. (6th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(Washington) U.S. President Roosevelt announced tonight that all national banks will be closed until Friday and ordered all banks to suspend payments of stored gold and other currencies. This move is intended to unify the situation in various states so that the President, his advisors, and members of Congress can thoroughly study the situation and formulate relief legislation. The new members of the House of Representatives will be sworn in on Thursday, and it is expected that the proposals submitted by the President and Congressional leaders will be considered on Friday. (5th Guomin News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>(New York) In addition to banning gold and silver exports, President Roosevelt today ordered the promulgation of regulations regarding the issuance of clearinghouse certificates and the prohibition of currency hoarding. This order took effect at 1 a.m. this morning. Banking circles believe this is a move by the United States to abolish the gold standard, but only for the duration of the bank holiday. The bank holiday will end on Thursday. A prominent banker here said today that President Roosevelt's move was very appropriate. The United States has recently experienced a significant outflow of gold coins. This order can prevent further outflow of gold coins and allow Congress to calmly formulate more permanent relief measures. At the same time, banks are now preparing to issue tens of millions of dollars in clearinghouse certificates, which, together with the currency currently in circulation, should allow sufficient commerce to proceed smoothly during this difficult period. Treasury Secretary Woodin said that the President's intention is that the United States has not abandoned the gold standard. Anyone who believes that the gold standard has been abolished is making a big mistake. This is merely a state of managed currency. Switzerland is a gold standard country, but it also prohibits cash exports. (6th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(New York) The United States has abandoned the gold standard and is using a managed currency based on effective methods, with no set term. Although Secretary of the Treasury Woodin has firmly denied abandoning the gold standard, it is, in fact, an abandonment, but perhaps only as a temporary measure. What will be the status of foreign deposits in the United States after the bank holiday ends? This is currently a matter of speculation. According to financial experts, the United States cannot allow free cash withdrawals for the time being. Banks will not be able to open and operate as usual unless domestic cash payments are suspended. Therefore, cash exports will likely be restricted, and temporary cash will not be freely exportable. President Roosevelt's warning to hoarders implies a special tax on hoarded gold in the future. Whether this kind of threatening rhetoric can force cash back into banks is still uncertain. The overall forecast for the financial tide is that one of the future results will be the organization of a banking system under strict government supervision, replacing the current complex and numerous banks. The reaction in the market will depend on the final actions taken before the ordinary banking industry recovers. The commodity market has not yet been affected by the government's announcement, but whether it can open on Tuesday is still undecided and remains in doubt. The foreign exchange market is likely to be formally closed, but private transactions may occur here and elsewhere. If the United States finally decides to abandon the gold standard, the already troubled world market will encounter another powerful competitor, which will disrupt the market. However, this development depends on the extent to which the U.S. currency depreciates. The impact on various commodities cannot be predicted. For example, cotton is expected to rise in price, but the extent of the increase depends on unpredictable developments. As for imported goods such as raw silk, it is also difficult to predict their position. Silk prices may rise due to the appreciation of the Japanese yen and the U.S. exchange rate. If silk prices rise, sales will decrease. This development will also give Japan a trade disadvantage. (6th Reuters dispatch)</p>

<p>(Washington) Four hundred million yuan of deposits in U.S. national banks suddenly became non-performing assets today with President Roosevelt's stroke of a pen. Commercial transactions must use clearing house small denomination notes. No gold yuan is allowed to flow out of banks before Friday. American bankers who violate this ban will be subject to imprisonment of up to ten years and fines of up to ten thousand yuan.</p>

<p>Roosevelt's move has made him a financial dictator in the United States, wielding the wartime dictatorial powers granted to the President. The United States has never had such strict financial laws, which shows the severity of the situation. Although the order stipulates that the President and the Treasury Secretary may specially relax the ban on individual banks, it is expected that this special case will not be opened during this short period.</p>
<h3 id="e26">Treasury Secretary Denies Abandoning the Gold Standard; Crisis Expected to Subside Soon <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>The current President and his advisors are preparing to submit a plan to Congress. The Treasury Secretary immediately declared after issuing the order that the United States has not abandoned the gold standard and promised that the financial crisis would be resolved soon and prosperity would be restored. The President also explained the reason for wielding these financial powers, saying that foreign withdrawals and domestic withdrawals have created this national emergency, so they must be restricted.</p>
<h3 id="e27">Ban Applies to All U.S. Banks; Territories Make Appropriate Adjustments <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>This ban now applies to all banks, trust companies, and building and loan associations in the country and its territories, as well as companies engaged in disguised banking businesses. However, for banks in the territories, the Treasury Secretary may, at his discretion, allow them to continue operations until further orders. It is reported that officials in the Philippines have assured the Treasury Department that the island's banks are able to meet reasonable withdrawals by depositors and have requested that they be allowed to continue operations as usual. In addition, banks in the country with particularly abundant liquidity may also be allowed to continue operations at the discretion of the Treasury Department. According to this order, it is equivalent to a most stringent ban on gold exports, not only prohibiting the payment or transport of cash but also prohibiting the marking of cash as the property of a particular account. In other words, all cash held by banks must be stored in its original location. Even transfers from one bank to another are prohibited. However, those who wish to deposit cash into a bank within the country may open a special account, and this money will be stored separately, and depositors may withdraw it at any time without restriction. Also, according to the order, the Treasury Secretary may, at any time, check the cash and business conditions of each bank to determine when it is safe to allow it to resume operations.</p>

<p>The Treasury Secretary also has supervisory power over the issuance of small denomination notes by the clearing house. These notes must be fully guaranteed by banks in each town, but may only be issued if the Treasury Department considers the total amount of liquid funds of banks in that area to be a satisfactory guarantee. At present, the Treasury Department is drafting issuance regulations, which will be supervised by the Treasury Department from above and directly managed by the Federal Reserve Banks in each district below. Although the notes are currently used as cash, they will not be redeemable in the future but can only be returned to the bank as a deposit. Banks must also decide what percentage of their total deposits to issue small denomination notes for and then notify this percentage to depositors so that depositors can pre-allocate their operating funds and living expenses. Although there are no restrictions on whether securities and commodity exchanges are open or not, the Treasury Secretary stated that they are unlikely to open before Friday.

However, optimists believe that although the Japanese yen will appreciate, it will not exceed 25 U.S. cents, so there is no reason for excessive pessimism. (6th Reuters)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The impact of the U.S. financial panic on Japan is more serious than leaving the League of Nations. Exchanges across the country have uniformly closed for two days, and the silk market has closed for four days. At the same time, the Ministries of Commerce and Industry, Agriculture and Forestry, Foreign Affairs, and Finance have all convened ministerial meetings to discuss countermeasures closely. Japanese Finance Minister Takahashi Korekiyo invited Bank of Japan Governor Hisashi Hijikata and Yokohama Specie Bank President Kenji Kodama to the ministry to participate in the discussion. Financial circles are deeply concerned that the U.S. panic will ruin the Japanese exchange rate market and trigger a domestic agricultural panic. It is rumored that the result of the meeting of key financial figures is that if the U.S. ban on gold exports becomes a practical implementation, Japan's foreign trade will be most severely affected. Foreign yarns, white sugar, and various commodities will be imported in large quantities, and Japanese industry will inevitably be pressured. To prevent the inflow of foreign goods and coordinate foreign trade, the Japanese government must promptly use exchange rate management laws to prevent the appreciation of the Japanese yen. On the one hand, it should raise tariffs to prevent the inflow of foreign goods into Japan. (6th China United Press dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Tokyo exchange banks held an emergency meeting at the Marunouchi Bank Assembly Hall at noon today. As a result, it was decided to suspend exchange business on the 7th as well. Osaka will also imitate this suspension. (6th Denstu Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Central Japan Silk Industry Association convened a joint meeting today. Irie, Director of the Sericulture Department of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, and others attended the meeting to discuss countermeasures to deal with the U.S. financial panic. Japan's exports to the United States in 1932 totaled 444,514,700 yuan, of which silk accounted for 306,014,900 yuan, or 80 percent. Once the U.S.-Japan exchange rate changes, Japanese farmers will fall back into a tragic hell. Therefore, the Japanese Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry is particularly concerned about the future of the U.S. panic and is working closely with trade associations to study countermeasures. Currently, because the United States itself has not yet made a decision, Japan naturally cannot decide on countermeasures in advance. (6th China United Press)</p>

<p>(London) At a meeting in the House of Commons this afternoon, a member questioned the arms embargo imposed on China and Japan. Foreign Secretary Simon replied that currently, various countries have not expressed a unanimous agreement on this matter, which has placed Britain in a position where it cannot continue to proceed. He and the Prime Minister will first handle this matter in Geneva this week, but before departing for Geneva, he intends to contact other countries first. Simon also answered a question from Labour Party leader Lansbury, saying that the decision last week was of a temporary nature, pending the expression of other countries' attitudes. The British government has always believed that a unanimously accepted approach is the permanent solution. (6th Reuters dispatch)</p>

<p>At the National Government Memorial Week</p>
<p>Recalling Impressions of a Small Banquet During His Trip to Japan</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The National Government held a memorial week at 9 a.m. on the 6th. Yu Youren, Dai Chuanxian, Niu Yongjian, Jing Hengyi, Zhou Zhenlin, Zhu Jiahua, Wang Yongbin, Chen Shuren, Liang Hancao, Chen Shaokuan, He Yaozu, Huang Musong, Chen Yi, Lu Chao, Wei Huai, and more than 500 National Government staff members attended. Chairman Lin led the ceremony. Dai Chuanxian reported, stating that the recent resolution of the League of Nations has made it clear that Japan is invading us and that right and wrong have been clearly distinguished by the world. However, Japan has been attacking with increasing ferocity in the past two weeks. From before the September 18th Incident until now, the Japanese clearly know that their actions are illegal and violate justice, but they still act recklessly. If a determination on legality and justice could make Japan realize its errors, there would not be today. I remember in 1927, I was ordered to go to Japan and stayed in Tokyo for more than 60 days, giving more than 80 public speeches. After each speech, I debated with the audience and eventually made most of the anti-Japanese people deeply understand that our party and our ideas were very legitimate and deeply admired them. When I was about to leave Japan, I heard that the Revolutionary Army had recovered Nanjing, and at this time, the Japanese military authorities suddenly invited me to a banquet. During the banquet, the host gave a toast, saying that he greatly admired Mr.'s advocacy and the Kuomintang's principles. Now that your country's revolutionary regime has been placed on the international stage, there is still one thing to say: the prosperity of a country does not depend on talking but on having the strength to do it. Japan's achievements today are entirely due to what it has done. Please drink a glass to wish you hard work and so on. The tone and demeanor were extremely ferocious and cold. This feeling and impression have never been forgotten by me. At that time, their performance had already foreshadowed the fact that they would invade our country today. Now, the whole world has made it clear who is right and wrong in Japan's invasion of us. If we want this judgment to be effective, only the Chinese themselves can make thorough efforts to achieve this goal. Especially in the last two weeks, we have suffered such violence. It is not good for me to say anything, so I bring up the impression of the small banquet in Japan at that time to let you know the intentions of the Japanese and their views on right and wrong, based on their own responsibilities and their future path, which are very clear. I hope that you comrades will be vigilant. The ceremony ended at 10 o'clock. (6th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>Denies Rumors of Resigning Due to Illness</p>
<p>Encourages Colleagues to Persevere and Endure Hardship</p>
<p>(Nanjing) On the morning of the 6th, at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Memorial Week, Minister Luo made the following remarks on the Rehe incident: I have been at the ministry since January 28th of last year, and it has been a year since then. I am grateful to my colleagues for their assistance and hard work. It is undeniable that the recent military setbacks have affected diplomacy. From now on, those who handle diplomacy should not blame fate or others, but should raise their spirits and fight to the end. The difficulties ahead may be greater than the present or greater than the past few decades. However, the more difficulties there are, the more we must fight. The Rehe incident should be observed as a normal event, not as an accident, and we should not be discouraged. How to recover lost territory depends on how we fight. A Shanghai newspaper on the 5th reported that "Luo Wengan resigned due to illness," which is purely a rumor and absolutely untrue. Today, I read in the Jingbao newspaper that "Foreign Minister Luo is in pain and wants to die." Pain and anger are certainly present, but the desire to die is not. It is possible to be killed by the enemy, but it is impossible to die of illness. There is illness, but no claiming to be ill. I will certainly resign when times are comfortable, but I will not resign when times are difficult. No matter how difficult the situation is, I am determined to do my best. The more difficult things are, the more they must be done. I hope my colleagues will work hard, persevere, and endure hardship for ten or several decades. The failure of the Rehe incident this time is mostly due to the hearts of the people. Colleagues must change this atmosphere and abide by the ancient saying "Give my all until my heart stops beating" and work hard. (6th Central News Agency dispatch)</p>

<p>Trial Expected Within a Week or So</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The period during which Chen Duxiu and Peng Shuzhi were not allowed to receive visitors has passed. A reporter, with the consent of Warden Luo and Chen Peng, was led into the prison by Warden Luo. Chen and Peng were in room number two. After the prison guard opened the door, the two men greeted them with smiles, saying that they had last met in Nanjing a few months ago. The room contained two beds, a square table, rattan chairs, a bookshelf, a back chair, and other items. There was a stove in the room, and the air was warm. There were many books on the shelves, including thread-bound books such as The Analects, The Book of History, and The Book of Poetry, as well as dozens of books from the Complete Library on "Anthropology," publications from the International Law Anatomy Academy, and more than a dozen German books. Both men were wearing leather robes, cotton pants, and cotton shoes. The living conditions were still very good. Chen said that since coming to Nanjing, his body has become stronger, and his appetite has also improved. His stomach problems have been cured, and his face has become plumper. In prison, in addition to reading, he also had a set schedule for getting up, living, and walking. Mr. Cai Yuanpei, Yang Xingfo, and Jiang Menglin all came to visit last year, but there has been no correspondence recently. The trial date is still unknown. Even his defense lawyer has not received notification. The lawyers hired are Zhang Shizhao, Peng Wangye, and Wu Zhiping. Who will be the main defender will be decided by them. It is likely that Zhang Shizhao will take the lead. As for the public trial in Nanjing, his opinions will be detailed in the defense statement. Peng Shuzhi's statements were roughly the same as Chen's and did not want to say more. Judging from his expression, it seemed that he had a feeling of repenting for his past actions. (6th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) There is still no definite date for the trial of Communist leaders Chen Duxiu, Peng Shuzhi, and others. However, the judge handling the case will come to Nanjing in a few days. Chen's case has been handled by the Criminal Division of the Jiangsu High Court. The progress of the litigation cannot be investigated here, but the trial period should not exceed a week or so. Chen and others live comfortably in prison, and their expressions are better than when they were imprisoned. (6th Central News Agency dispatch)</p>

<p>Dai Chuanxian's Report</p>
<p>National Revival Depends Entirely on Struggle</p>
<p>(Nanjing) At 8 a.m. on the 6th, the 68th Memorial Week of the Central Government was held. Ye Chucang, Chen Lifu, Dai Chuanxian, Ju Zheng, Zhang Ji, Zheng Zhannan, Li Ciwen, Hong Ludong, Miao Peicheng, Wang Qi, and more than 400 staff members attended. Ye Chucang presided over the meeting. Dai Chuanxian reported that the national crisis has reached its most dangerous time. In the past, we hoped that the League of Nations would take action, but as a result, although it failed to achieve actual sanctions, right and wrong have been clarified. This shows that justice and fairness have not been extinguished. However, whether justice can ultimately prevail still depends on solving the problem of our own efforts. We must rely on our own struggle. Only by following the Prime Minister's last words, "If you cannot succeed, you must become benevolent," can we save the country from danger. Those in the battlefield should be like this, and comrades in the rear and the people of the whole country should also embrace this spirit and maximize their abilities in their duties or professions to actively assist us. If we cannot do this, even if the League of Nations can uphold justice, it cannot turn our country's critical situation into safety. Hardship revitalizes the nation, which has been proven by historical facts. We cannot estimate the time of our national salvation efforts. Perhaps it will take months or perhaps years. Currently, we only know how to fight and should not have other concerns. (6th Central News Agency dispatch)</p>

According to Li, he came to inspect the military situation in the North regarding Japan and to discuss plans against Japan with Yan. He will depart for Xinxiang in two or three days. There is also a rumor that Feng Yuxiang will come to Taiyuan to meet with Yan within seven days. (Special dispatch, 6th) (Beiping) Huang Shaogu arrived in Zhangjiakou on the 5th to visit Feng Yuxiang, reporting on his negotiations with Chiang and the Central Government in Nanjing and Jiangxi. According to Feng's remarks to others, he will not go to Nanjing for the time being because the situation after the fall of Chengde is different from that a month ago. The Central Government and Chiang hope he will go south to discuss major anti-Japanese plans. However, with Beiping and Tianjin in turmoil and Chahar and Suiyuan under pressure, a strong enemy is approaching. The nation only has the strength to resist, seize opportunities, and there is no room for empty talk about resisting Japan. Currently, the only option is to concentrate the nation's forces in North China. He Yingqin has already come north. There is talk that the Central Party Headquarters office may move from Xinxiang to Beiping. It is rumored that Chiang will also go north soon. If there are consultations, they can be met in North China. It is also rumored that Feng will go to Shanxi to meet Yan Xishan and Li Liejun, but this is not yet determined. Li telegraphed Feng only saying he was going north to meet and did not invite Feng to Shanxi. (Special dispatch, 6th)</p>

<p>Wang Faqin Issues Statement</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Preparations for the Central Government's North China Office have been completed. Zhang Ji is scheduled to depart at 7 PM on the 6th, transferring from the Jinpu Railway to the Longhai Railway, to Xinxiang to hold a meeting as scheduled on the 8th and announce the formal establishment. Wang Faqin, Fang Juehui, Miao Peicheng, Ji Liang, Wang Luyi, and others are traveling with him. Chen Lifu plans to depart tomorrow due to other matters. This reporter met with Zhou Zhenlin, the newly appointed inspector for the Rehe and Chahar-Suiyuan districts, on the morning of the 6th and asked when he would go north. He said that given the current chaotic situation, the urgent task is how to save the nation. It is difficult to predict when he will go north to establish the inspector's office. (Central News Agency dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Wang Faqin stated that the Japanese invasion of China has received fair judgment from the world. Although the League of Nations has not implemented sanctions against the brutal Japanese, China can rightfully use force to recover lost territories. However, the generals guarding the territory retreated without a fight and allowed Rehe to fall into enemy hands. This not only results in frequent loss of territory but also has a significant international impact. How can we talk about resistance after this? Those who have the responsibility of defending the territory, how will they face the people of the nation? This is a truly painful matter. Feng Huanzhang may soon leave Chahar for Shanxi to discuss anti-Japanese measures with Li Xiehe and Yan Baichuan. After Li left Nanjing and went north, it was originally planned that if Feng did not go to Taiyuan, Li would go to Zhangjiakou to meet him. Given the recent situation, Feng may leave Chahar for Shanxi, so his trip to Xinxiang will be delayed by a few days. Fang Juehui stated that the loss of Chengde is heartbreaking for the entire nation. However, what is gone is gone, what about the future? This is the time for the whole nation to rise up and save itself. Passivity is not the way to save the nation; active resistance is the only way out. How to resist in the future depends on the efforts of the people of the nation. He needs to go to Shanghai soon, so his trip north will be delayed by a few days. After going north, he will inspect the Rehe and Suiyuan areas. Although the North China Office is about to be established, whether there will be difficulties in implementation is still difficult to predict at this time. (Special dispatch, 6th)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The Beiping City Executive Committee telegraphed Zhang Xueliang on the 6th, saying that the brutal Japanese have been plotting against Rehe for more than a year. The local authorities made no preparations in advance. When the war broke out, Tang Yulin telegraphed and vowed to defend to the death. The people of the nation rushed around and called for assistance. Unexpectedly, without any contact, Rehe collapsed without a fight, and Tang even went back on his vow. He should be arrested and sent to the capital for public punishment. A large army is gathered on the Rehe border and should be ordered to counterattack immediately and recover the territory within a time limit. If you continue to hesitate and look around, how can you face the people of the nation? The Incident of the Three Northeastern Provinces can be attributed to the suddenness of the event, but the Rehe war has been brewing for a long time. The authorities have repeatedly expressed their determination to resist, but the result is a great disappointment to the people of the nation, which is extremely painful. You have long been entrusted with the important military task of defending North China and protecting the territory from foreign aggression. There is no room for shirking responsibility. It is time to mend the fold after losing the sheep. If you continue to delay and make mistakes, you will not only be abandoned by the people of the nation, but also become a sinner for all generations. What to do and where to go, please choose.

<p>Breaks Pivotal Position of Catholic Centre Party</p>
<p>Hitler's Arduous Struggle Finally Succeeds</p>
<p>Expected that Anti-Red Movement Will Become More Severe in the Future</p>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, 6th The election was a great victory for Hitler, and the methods he used have worked. The people mostly trust him. The National Socialists now not only occupy 288 seats in parliament, but also with the assistance of the two right-wing parties, namely the German National People's Party and the German People's Party, they can obtain a majority of about 23 seats in parliament, thereby breaking the long-standing deadlock in parliament.</p>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, 6th According to the official report released by the Electoral Commission today, with the help of the National People's Party and the German People's Party, the National Socialist Party will have a majority of 47 seats in the new parliament. The new parliament has a total of 647 seats. The National Socialist Party occupies 288 seats, the National People's Party occupies 52 seats, and the German People's Party occupies 7 seats, for a total of 347 seats. Those who oppose Hitler, namely the Socialist Party and the National Party, occupy 125 seats, the Communist Party 81 seats, the Centre Party 73 seats, the Bavarian People's Party 19 seats, plus another 2 seats, for a total of 300 seats.</p>
<p>National, Berlin, 6th It can be said that the German parliament has entered a new era today. The government has gained the support of the majority of the country and can now consolidate its position and implement administrative and constitutional changes, which are necessary to begin its national policy. The first effect of Sunday's development will likely be that the government's anti-red movement will be even more severe than before in order to eradicate the communist scourge. This is one of the goals announced by Hitler. Hitler has become a national hero today. Tracing back to the beginning of his rise, the people of the country all laughed at his foolishness, but Hitler was not deterred by it. Relying on his inner self and perseverance, he promoted his doctrine, and first had hundreds of followers, then increased to thousands, then tens of thousands, then hundreds of thousands and millions. He exhausted himself and tasted hardships. After thirteen years of thorns, he finally reached Kangzhuang and became the leader of 70 million people, holding the key to the gate of saving the country. It can be said that where there is a will, there is a way.</p>
<p>Havas, Berlin, 6th Goering, the Minister of the Interior of Prussia, issued a notice, saying that "[yesterday, the nationalist front achieved a great advantage. Since the Bismarck era, the Centre Party has always occupied a pivotal position in the political situation, but now it has been destroyed. This is really the first time. In addition, it is noteworthy that in the southern states, the National Socialist Party has an even greater advantage. Therefore, the governments of the southern states have no right to continue to represent public opinion to govern the states, because public opinion has already attached itself to Hitler," etc. This is probably the first declaration issued by the leaders of the National Socialist Party after the election, which was directed at the governments of the southern states, with the intention of advising the governments of the states to find ways to adapt to the policies adopted by the federal government and Prussia in politics.</p>

<p>Stormtroopers' Armed Parade - Berlin Resembles Wartime State - Berlin, 5th (Havas Dispatch) - Today's House of Representatives election saw a large number of voters. The weather was fine, so voters were very enthusiastic. Until 4:00 PM, no major incidents occurred. The atmosphere was calm in the morning, but became tense in the afternoon. The main streets in and around central Berlin were thronged with people, making Berlin resemble a city occupied by troops. This was because the Nazi stormtroopers and Stahlhelm members were parading everywhere in uniform. 35,000 Stahlhelm members gathered in southwestern Berlin and marched from the Brandenburg Gate to Unter den Linden in central Berlin until 4:00 PM. The sidewalks on both sides were packed with people. The flags carried by the various private armies were similar to the military flags of the imperial era. When these flags passed, the crowd sang the national anthem, and the people followed the Stahlhelm troops with great interest. In general, the Stahlhelm party was more prevalent in the center of Berlin. They appeared to not carry weapons. In the areas surrounding the city, the Nazi stormtroopers were more numerous. Since this morning, the Nazi troops have been converging on Berlin from various locations by train or truck. Many of them wore armbands with the words "Auxiliary Police" and patrolled everywhere with pistols and batons. Even Nazi troops who were not part of the auxiliary police carried pistols or weapons. The Nazi troops used police express trucks used by the police. The police cars have been under their free control. The Nazi troops had gathered near Berlin beforehand and only arrived in the city today. The entire police force was mobilized, carrying pistols, rifles, and machine guns while patrolling the streets. Cars equipped with extremely powerful searchlights accompanied them.</p>
<p>Berlin, 5th (Havas Dispatch) - During the German election, German expatriates residing abroad participated in voting for the first time today.

Many German expatriates in Vienna, Tyrol, and eastern Austria have also returned to vote. It is estimated that more than 10,000 people have returned from Denmark to vote.</p>

<p>Berlin, 6th (Reuters) - The National Socialist Party is unusually jubilant about the victory in this election. It is widely expected that the National Socialist Party may arrest all communist members so that they do not have to rely on the assistance of friendly parties and can hold an overwhelming majority in Parliament. The National Socialist Party is still pursuing its policy of eliminating political enemies. All newspapers of the Socialist Party in Thuringia have been banned from publication twice. The power of the Socialist mayor to manage police affairs has been stripped. Furthermore, the General Association of German Jews in Thuringia has been disbanded. The National Socialist Party has taken over the police administration of the Free City of Hamburg by order of Interior Minister Dr. Frick because an anti-National Socialist coalition holds power there.</p>

<p>Hamburg, 5th (Havas Agency) - The Free City of Hamburg has, until now, held an opposing attitude towards the National Socialist Party. Tonight, the National Socialist Party forcibly seized the administrative power of the city. Two to three hundred Nazi stormtroopers entered the city government around 10 PM and occupied it. The Nazi party leader in Hamburg, Gauleiter Kaufmann, gave a short speech on the balcony of the city government. Other party leaders were also present at the scene. Federal Interior Minister Frick ordered the local police to immediately hand over the administrative power of the Free City to Senator Liesche, a member of the Nazi Party and a member of the Hamburg Senate. Although the Hamburg Senate protested, they had no choice but to obey in fact. Mayor Petersen has already resigned.

<p>Miami, 6th (Reuters) - Chicago Mayor Cermak, who was shot in the abdomen on the 16th of this month when someone attempted to assassinate President Roosevelt, died today due to ineffective treatment at the age of 59. Cermak was born near Prague, and moved to the United States when he was just one year old. From the age of twelve, he worked in factories and mines while studying at night school. Later he studied law and eventually became a judge. In 1931, he was elected mayor of Chicago and was renowned for clearing up long-standing abuses and severely punishing local tyrants. The criminal Zangara has been sentenced to 80 years in prison. Now that Cermak is dead, the criminal will be charged with murder, which will result in the death penalty.</p>
<h3 id="e93">Chaos in Northern Manchuria Under the Iron Heel of the Japanese Army <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>Songhua River Puppet Army Defects and Resists Japan</p>
<p>Gambling dens abound along the Chinese Eastern Railway</p>
<p>British goods entering Manchuria are all excluded</p>
<p>Harbin, 25th (Special Correspondence of the North-China Daily News) - In the past two weeks, the Japanese army has been frequently mobilizing in the Songhua River area. Before the 14th, 700 people had been traveling down the river in long-distance buses. It is now known that the leading scout car, which was about 500 yards ahead of the main convoy, carried ten Japanese soldiers, one White Russian driver, and one assistant. It was supposed to stop at a location 40 miles from Sanxing Gorge (near Yilan), but suddenly disappeared. The area is located at a river bend and has a high hill. When the main convoy passed, guns fired from the hill, causing many Japanese soldiers to be killed or injured. Seven cars were then used to carry the wounded back to Harbin. The cars were too badly damaged to be used again. Three days ago, the Japanese military authorities again requisitioned 20 long-distance buses to transport troops downstream, but the Chinese and Russian drivers refused to drive. The Japanese army then intercepted 20 long-distance buses on the street, expelled the passengers, and forced them to drive downstream. Two of the drivers, realizing the purpose of the requisition, jumped off and escaped. The Japanese then ordered the company to find replacements. The company could not comply and excused itself by saying that it could not find reliable drivers. No one knows what the true situation is downstream of the Songhua River. It is said that the troops of the "Manchukuo" in Fujin and along the river have mostly defected and joined the anti-Manchu army because there are still many armed forces resisting "Manchukuo" in that area. Another report claims that 432 Japanese expatriates who went to develop the lower reaches of the Songhua River last year were attacked by anti-Manchu troops. Japanese troops from Harbin were dispatched to protect the Japanese expatriates. However, regardless of the truth of either statement, this situation shows that there is no peace and order in many areas of northern Manchuria. Furthermore, since the original Japanese troops stationed there have been moving south in large numbers in the past few days, there may soon be more anti-Manchu battles. Currently, vehicles coming east along the Chinese Eastern Railway are often filled with refugees from the border areas. Passenger cars that can carry 40 people often carry as many as 85. This shows that the Chinese people in the area anticipate war soon and are fleeing in large numbers. This is another evidence of the unrest in eastern Jilin. In the past, the Harbin authorities could boast of strictly enforcing the ban on gambling. If a gambling den was discovered, the police would immediately seal it off and severely punish the owners. Now, however, gambling dens abound in Chuandian and the major cities and towns along the Chinese Eastern Railway, sucking up the people's money. These gambling dens have special areas for people of all three social classes. There are even places set up specifically for rickshaw pullers to gamble with a few copper coins. Most of the gambling den owners are White Russians. It is said that there are currently more than 500 gambling dens in the Chuandian district alone. They often set up gambling dens in public places and gamble openly. According to a Western newspaper, the authorities collect gambling taxes, ranging from 200 to 1,000 yuan per month per establishment. They are also closely monitored, and the tax amount is increased as soon as their income increases. At present, larger cities and towns along the Chinese Eastern Railway, such as Anda, Ang'angxi, Hailar, and Manchuria, are all covered in gambling dens. It is no wonder that the number of people committing suicide is increasing day by day, there are groups of beggars on the streets, and robbery cases occur every day. The "Manchukuo" customs often create difficulties for foreign imports by unreasonably levying taxes. Recently, a batch of pure British wool fabrics arrived in Dalian, and the customs officers forcibly claimed that the goods contained 2% artificial silk, imposing a heavy tax of 45% ad valorem. These goods had been frequently transported to Manchuria in the previous five years, and their quality was sufficient to prevent rain. It is ridiculous that the Japanese claimed that they contained artificial silk. Therefore, it can be considered that the Japanese want to block the import of British goods. In addition, incidents of obstructing foreign trade are even more frequent. The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs has repeatedly stated that Manchuria is open. Now, its door is obviously only open to those going to Manchuria, but it is not easy for those coming to Manchuria to enter the country. In the past, British insurance companies did well in Manchuria, but now not only must all government offices insure with Japanese insurance companies, but those who insure with European insurance companies will also be regarded as spies, and their property may be confiscated. In short, in any industry that the Japanese can operate, they exclude Westerners. Foreigners in Manchuria can only sell goods that the Japanese cannot counterfeit.</p>
<h3 id="e94">The Japanese Consul in Tianjin Protests Unreasonably <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>Muzzling Claiming That Stationing Troops in Muzhuangzi Violates the Treaty</p>
<p>The Provincial Government Did Not Reply Because It Was Not a Fact</p>
<p>The Boxer Protocol Should Be Mutually Observed</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence - The Japanese Consul General in Tianjin, Kazue Kuwashima, recently claimed that Chinese troops were stationed in Muzhuangzi, violating the Boxer Protocol's stipulation that "no troops are allowed within 20 li of Tianjin." He protested to the Hebei Provincial Government a few days ago. The Provincial Government did not reply, believing that the Consul's claims were completely untrue. Yesterday, Chairman Yu of the Provincial Government stated that Japan often invokes the Boxer Protocol to restrict our activities, but does not know that this treaty does not only concern China and Japan, and the obligation to abide by it is a responsibility that all parties concerned should jointly bear. Even the Japanese army's occupation of Yuguan has violated the dignity of the treaty, but they are still sophistical and evasive. Recently, they have made three consecutive protests to our Provincial Government. The reason for the first protest was to oppose the deployment of our troops. The excuse for the second protest was that our troops were building forts in Dagu. The third protest was the so-called stationing of troops in Muzhuangzi. The first two protests have been replied to, as they were all based on misunderstandings and relied on the Boxer Protocol to make demands. The claim that forts are being built at Dagu is completely inaccurate and can be easily proven by the facts. Digging trenches is only a temporary exercise and does not conflict with any of the provisions of the treaty. As for the Japanese army in Tianjin's previous statement that it will jointly supervise the Chinese local government to fulfill its obligations with the consuls of the other Boxer Protocol signatory countries, namely Britain, France, and Italy, the Provincial Government has not officially heard of this matter. However, it is confident that the Chinese government is always abiding by the treaty, but it also hopes that the relevant countries will exercise their power in case of emergency and impose severe sanctions on those who violate the treaty. Furthermore, more than 100 Japanese soldiers who invaded Rehe have been transported back to the rear for treatment due to frostbite. The Japanese military authorities have publicized that this was caused by a poisonous gas attack by the Chinese army, which is purely to confuse international public opinion. "Frostbite" and "poisoning" can be distinguished by their symptoms. Since the Japanese have created this atmosphere, it is important to pay attention to whether they intend to use poisonous gas to attack the Rehe army. (March 4)</p>

<p>Xifengjia Village, Eighth District, Robbed</p>
<p>Two Bandit Boats Discovered in the River off Xujiaqiao, Xiaokunshan Last Night - The villagers of Da Lou Township, who first discovered the bandit boats, sounded the gongs to alert others. The neighboring villages followed suit, and the sound of the gongs filled the sky. The bandits did not dare to act and fled west. However, more than ten bandits landed in Xifengjia Village, within the territory of Tianma Mountain. Carrying two pistols and speaking in a mix of local dialects, they rushed into the Zhao family to rob. However, the villagers of the village had heard that Xiaokunshan had been robbed many times and were prepared. Every night, someone patrolled. When the bandits were robbing in the Zhao family's house, they were suddenly startled by the villagers sounding the gongs and shouting to catch them. They fled west. Fortunately, the Zhao family did not suffer any losses.</p>

<p>Construction of the Xijing Road</p>
<p>Feng Junyan, Chief of the Sixth District, and Zhao Yingqiu, Chief of the Seventh District, are raising large sums of money to build the Xijing Road for the sake of facilitating transportation. The road starts from the Tangtou Bashiqiao in Dongbeitang and ends at Zhangjingqiao, with a total length of 14 miles. The original road was narrow and unusable, and it is now planned to be widened to nine feet. The entire road project requires approximately 14,000 workers. The former Construction Bureau has already sent personnel to the countryside to survey the road and mark it with lime. Construction was originally scheduled to begin on the first of this month, but the project has been delayed until now due to continuous cloudy and rainy weather. Construction will begin as soon as the weather clears and warms. All construction procedures have been prepared.</p>

<p>Opening a Coffin for Autopsy in a Private Murder Case - Jiang Cairong, a villager from Liuducun near Liyuncun in the Ninth District of Wuyi County, injured and killed Shen Yinbao, a beggar, during a wax sacrifice last year. Jiang Cairong was released on bail by the Eighth Sub-bureau of Public Security and privately settled the case without reporting it. Yang Kongyi, the chief prosecutor of the county court, heard about the incident and went to the countryside to open the coffin for autopsy the day before yesterday. That night, he stayed in the Yunxun Village Inn and interrogated Shen Chen, the mother of the deceased, and Miao Nuying, the village chief, as well as Ma Jusheng and others who mediated the private settlement. Shen Chen and others requested that the coffin not be opened for autopsy. The village chief sent his son to the scene. The next morning, Prosecutor Yang went to the Nanyi Yizhong Cemetery to open the coffin for autopsy as prescribed by law. Jiang Cairong and others avoided coming to the scene. The autopsy revealed that the corpse had been injured on the left cheek before falling into the water and drowning. He ordered the corpse to be reburied. After returning to the court, Prosecutor Yang ordered the relevant parties to be interrogated.</p>

<p>Dayun Temple Town, located at the intersection of Jiaxing and Jiashan, was robbed by bandits on the afternoon of February 16. More than ten men and women were kidnapped. The authorities of the two counties considered the case to be serious and sent water and land police to rescue the kidnapped people and pursue the stolen goods. However, many days passed without catching a single thief. Some of the more than ten kidnapped people have been released by the bandits. Cao Yueshan, Cao Diguan, Shen Shunqiu, Yao Lanqing, Bao Hushi, Liu Zhanggao and other six people are still in danger and their whereabouts are unknown, making it impossible to rescue them. It is reported that the provincial government is paying close attention to this case and has set a deadline of ten days for the Water Police District Chief of the Second District to solve the case. District Chief Zhao believes that since Jiangsu and Zhejiang have announced joint defense, bandits can be pursued regardless of provincial boundaries. Therefore, he has personally taken his troops to patrol the areas where Jiangsu and Zhejiang intersect.</p>

<p>Che Qifeng's mother, from Chejiatang, Shili Village, on the northern outskirts of this county, was kidnapped by bandits on the night of May 30 of the year before last. A large sum of money was extorted, and three days later, she was brutally murdered and her body was abandoned in the western suburbs. The county government conducted an autopsy. In July of that year, Water Police Inspector Sun Meizhang arrested a bandit named Wang Wenbiao and sent him to the county for legal action. On September 7 of that year, the stationed troops successively arrested Wang Chuanren and Wang Ruming. Wang Wenbiao was summoned for questioning, and all confessed to the details of the case. The Pacification Superintendent's Office and the Provincial Security Office sentenced them to death. However, the bandit Han Zhulin had heard of the incident and fled far away. He returned to the urban area last winter and colluded with local ruffians to plot wrongdoing. After someone informed on him, he could not escape. The county government sent Detective Pan Jie to Wangjiayuan, in the back of the county, on the morning of the 4th to arrest Han Guilin. He was taken back and reported to the team. He was severely interrogated and handed over to the county for strict handling according to the law.</p>

<p>A reporter from the New Voice News Agency specifically interviewed a certain member of the banking community in this city to inquire about how the Chinese banking community is dealing with the current financial disaster in the United States. The reply was, "The domestic recession in the United States has reached its extreme in recent years, so even though it is known as the 'Yellow Gold' country, it is still inevitable. The occurrence of this crisis has significantly affected countries in Europe and the United States. In the Far East, Japan has closer financial ties with the United States, and has suspended foreign exchange starting today. The exchange has also announced a temporary suspension. The severity of the situation is truly rare. As for our country, because the financial relationship with the United States is relatively shallow, in terms of debt, we only owe money to the United States.

It was initially rumored that the market would be temporarily suspended due to the excessive decline. However, although the discussion had not yet concluded by 4:30 PM, there was no accurate news of a market shutdown. Therefore, the market will still open as usual today.

<p>The "Ta Mei Evening News" reports that although American banks have suspended operations, the four American banks in this city are operating as usual today (the 6th). Furthermore, American Express and Thomas Cook are also operating as usual. However, there are some difficulties concerning the exchange of U.S. dollars due to the lack of exchange rates. Traveler's checks and money orders are being cashed as usual. The only difference today from usual is the difficulty in determining the price of U.S. dollars. Therefore, some banks have set temporary prices, while others pay in silver first and then settle the difference later. For example, Citibank and Chase Bank are handling U.S. dollar accounts and customers in this way. American Foreign Insurance Association and American Oriental Bank, which operate Far Eastern trade, both have their headquarters in Shanghai and are not affected by the suspension of American banks, are now also adopting the same procedures. Some shipping companies are crediting U.S. dollars first and settling later, while others are calculating according to temporary exchange rates. The prices offered by various Chinese small money shops vary from four yuan and eight jiao to four yuan and six jiao, while the purchase prices vary from four yuan and one jiao to four yuan and two jiao. It is said that there has been little trading.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Bean and Rice Trade Guild submitted a report to the Shanghai Municipal Government yesterday, stating: "Regarding the rice merchants from southern Shanghai who are obstructing transportation under the pretext of heavy measures and using this as a means of coercion, we respectfully request strict orders to arrest and apprehend them and, at the same time, to permit the abolition of volume measures and the adoption of weight measures in order to quell disputes and eliminate hidden dangers. It is humbly submitted that measuring instruments have been used in society for a long time. Guild members have been trading in and out of rice measures (shi) with the custom of being filled to the brim, and there has never been a dispute over heavy measures. Boatmen from Wuxi, Changshu, Songjiang, Qingpu, Jiaoli, Pinghu, Xincang, Jiaxing, Xindi, Zhujing, Sijing, Fengjing, Suzhou, Beizha, Lili, Zhouzhuang, Tongli and other ports have been transporting back and forth like shuttles, and merchants have been getting along without any differences. Recently, however, a so-called Alliance Association of Rice Merchants from Southern Shanghai has been nitpicking at the measurers on the pretext of heavy measures. When their intentions are not fulfilled, they obstruct transportation as a means of coercion. The old tricks that they used last September and October are being re-enacted today."</p>

<p>In addition to telegraphing the Chicago Exposition to retain the Chinese Pavilion, the Products Association sent Zhou Guanhong to visit Andrew Roth, the U.S. Commercial Counselor in China, at 10:00 a.m. yesterday to request its retention and explain the reasons. It was decided that a banquet would be held for Andrew Roth at the Taolechun Sichuan Restaurant on Sanma Road at 7:30 p.m. today. Andrew Roth cabled the U.S. city of Mei (transliteration) last night, stating: "Mr. Alberdi from Washington to Chicago, the China Products Association wishes to retain the name of the Chinese group and voluntarily participate in the Chicago Expo. The previously authorized Chinese venue area, measuring 20,000 square feet, is still hoped to be granted to the Products Association. The venue construction costs can be undertaken for 50,000 yuan. With the exhibition period approaching, a reply is urgently requested."</p>

<p>After the Products Association nominated fifteen directors, He Bingxian, Cai Wuji, Zhang Xianglin, Miao Zhongxiu, and others sent letters to the Products Association yesterday, resigning from their positions as directors. They wrote: "Regarding participation in the Chicago Exposition, after reading today's newspaper, we learned that your Association has nominated Bingxian and others as officers, and we dare not disobey. However, Bingxian and others were originally members of the Preparatory Committee and were appointed by the government order. We are now under orders to expedite the winding-up process and are unable to participate in the Association. We earnestly request that other capable individuals be nominated to avoid delaying the process. If there is anything we can do to help, we will wholeheartedly support it in our individual capacities to live up to your earnest friendship. We hereby respectfully decline and hope for your understanding. We would be grateful beyond measure."</p>

<p>Urgently Devise Plans to Redeem Himself</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce telegraphed Zhang Xueliang yesterday, stating: "To Zhang, Acting Chairman of the Beiping Military Branch: The disaster in Rehe, in less than ten days, has completely fallen into enemy hands. Recalling your clever telegrams, they have become a joke. The international community laughs, and the country is in pain and anger. From now on, the Japanese warlords will increasingly treat our generals as if they were incompetent and slaughter us at will. Tang Yulin was your old subordinate, greedy and fond of profit, and unpopular. After the fall of Shenyang, the key to the northern gate, how could you entrust it to the wrong person? You should have secretly reported to the Central Government long ago to deal with it. Even if you were hesitant to harm the rat for fear of breaking the vase, fearing that this move would strengthen his heart to flee to the barbarians, you should have selected elite troops early to assist in military preparations and not allowed the cowardly Rehe army to be deployed on the front line, giving the enemy an opportunity. Since you separately appointed a commander, it was early knowledge that Tang was difficult to bear the sole command. Why is it that the so-called commander-in-chief has not yet personally arrived at the front line? In this time of crisis, he is still leisurely staying in the safe rear of Peiping. It is Tang who has harmed Rehe, and it is you who have brewed Tang's harm of Rehe and harm of the country. The situation in the borderlands has deteriorated to this point. You should quickly devise plans to redeem yourself, send out all elite troops, and separately appoint a commander to go to the front line to recover the territory, so that the enemy cannot sit securely in Rehe and plot to spy on Chahar to the west and Hebei to the south. This is the urgent task today. If you only station troops at Gubeikou and Xifengkou, you are abandoning all of Rehe, and Hebei and Chahar will also follow in its footsteps. Please consider this carefully. The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce respectfully."</p>
<p>"To all of you: The violent Japanese planned a deception, broke faith and abandoned their neighbors. They have already usurped the eastern provinces and are now forcibly invading Jin and Yu, committing heinous crimes and losing famous cities one after another. All Chinese people are filled with pain and hatred. Now that the foreign disaster is deepening and imminent, the officers and soldiers defending the territory should have the determination to die for the country and eliminate the enemy. Now, news has come that Chengde has fallen again. Gu Yulin, who held the important responsibility of defending the border and was responsible for the front, is now the hope of the whole country. How could he have imagined that his failures would come in a single morning, leading to retreat, unable to defend or fight, losing territory and harming the country, causing the disaster in Rehe and allowing the enemy to drive straight in? This is something that both gods and men resent and that heaven and earth cannot tolerate. We should urgently request your association to issue a general order for strict arrest and immediately execute him by shooting, so that the national law can be rectified and the morale of the army can be encouraged. With Rehe already fallen, Peiping and Tianjin are even more urgent. The only plan now is to use the last breath to fight for life and death in an instant. We humbly implore Chairman Chiang to go north immediately to turn the crisis around, preside over the overall situation, pull us out of the fire and water and return the rivers and mountains, seize the passes and subdue the fierce rebels. We pledge to save the country, avenge our shame, and seek survival. This is the moment to speak frankly and respectfully, hoping that you will understand. Shanghai General Labor Union."</p>

<p>Sent a telegram to the Central Party Headquarters and the National Government yesterday, stating: "Reports indicate that Tang Yulin seized military vehicles to transport private property, leading a brigade and a regiment to retreat, allowing 120 Japanese soldiers to enter as if there were no one there and occupy Chengde. This is not only a loss of important passes, but it seems as if he is guiding the Japanese, delaying military opportunities more than anything else. If he is not severely punished, how can the national law be upheld and morale boosted? We hereby send a telegram requesting your headquarters (government) to quickly issue a clear order to arrest him and execute him by law to serve as a warning to others."</p>

<p>The General Bureau Has Not Received a Report from the Tianjin Bureau</p>
<p>The Suspension of Sending is of a Temporary Nature</p>
<p>After news of the fall of Chengde reached Shanghai, the Parcel Office of the Shanghai Postal Administration suspended the acceptance of parcels destined for all parts of Rehe starting yesterday morning. Letters are still being accepted, but there are very few. As of yesterday afternoon, the General Bureau had not yet received a report from the Tianjin Post Office regarding postal services in Rehe Province. Therefore, the General Bureau has not issued a circular regarding the suspension of mail to Rehe. The suspension of sending those parcels is only a temporary measure. In the future, regarding mail to Rehe, what should be suspended and what should be accepted will be determined after the report from the Tianjin Bureau arrives in Shanghai. Furthermore, according to Kang Yong, a standing committee member of the Postal Workers' Union, regarding the safety of postal workers in various parts of Rehe, the union has telegraphed the Beiping Workers' Union to find ways to evacuate them in batches, and there should be no danger.</p>
<h3 id="e123">Zhu Jiqing's Circular Telegram <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>"Today, there is either the enemy or me; either me or the enemy.</p>
<p>To seek national survival, only iron and blood will do."</p>
<p>The Shanghai Liaison Office of the Northeast National Salvation Army Command Headquarters received a rush telegram from Zhu Jiqing yesterday, stating: "To be distributed to all newspapers for the information of all compatriots: From the day this army was organized, it has been determined to fight the violent Japanese to the death. Even though we are surrounded by a strong enemy and bombarded by artillery fire, we dare not be timid or retreat. As long as there is a breath of life, this determination will not waver. Now, the enemy's atmosphere is intensifying day by day, and Rehe cannot be defended. This is the autumn of our nation's crisis and survival, and it is also the day when our people struggle for the nation. In the past, when the country was not well-established and internal strife was frequent, it could still be attributed to personal struggles for power, which had nothing to do with the common people. Now, however, the survival of the nation is at stake. To be masters or slaves is a matter of utmost urgency. Our ancestors braved thorns and established a great land for us descendants to live and thrive on. How can we sit idly by and allow it to be slaughtered by foreign races? In the past, during the September 18th Incident, we lost the three eastern provinces due to non-resistance. Now, although we are barely resisting, we are passive everywhere. The enemy gains the upper hand and we have no time to defend ourselves. We collapse without fighting. Moreover, there are still some generals who usually consider it their ability to withhold salaries and disturb the people, and at the critical moment, they panic and lose their composure. The enemy has not arrived, but they flee first, causing the entire army to be affected. Our people should request the government to inspire the hearts of the soldiers, strictly enforce military law, turn defense into offense, and fight to the death with the enemy. We must know that in today's situation, there is either the enemy or me; either me or the enemy. To seek the survival of the nation, only iron and blood will do. We hope that our people will all tremble at the crisis of the nation and rise up to urgently plan for it. Zhu Jiqing, rush."</p>

<p>French Postal Company Cables That He Will Arrive in Shanghai on the 17th</p>
<p>The French Postal Shipping Company received a cable from its headquarters in France yesterday, stating that Wang Jingwei, the President of the Executive Yuan of China, has taken the company's postal ship Aramis back to China and is expected to arrive in port around the 17th of this month.</p>
<p>Now, obstruction of transportation is not enough, so it is followed by blocking navigation. Blocking navigation is not enough, so it is increased by acts of violence. Minhang and Huangdu have both been blocked. However, this city is not a rice-producing area, and the food for the citizens depends on supplies from the interior. Now that the Alliance Association has obstructed transportation for more than half a month, fortunately, there are stocks of goods from Hunan, Anhui, and Jiangxi provinces to trade with, so no panic has occurred. If the problem is not resolved for a long time and at the same time rice merchants also disregard the overall situation and adopt a go-slow approach, then the danger of a shortage is imminent. At this time when the national crisis is pressing, the order in the rear is suddenly disrupted, and who will be blamed? I believe that the way to solve the problem is to deal with it fairly. The focus of the Alliance Association's dispute is the accusation of heavy measures. Then, it is possible to abandon volume measures and adopt weight measures. In the past, imported rice and domestic Hunan, Anhui, and Jiangxi rice have all been packaged and weighed for sale, and there has been no objection since trading. Some people may think that volume measures are used in the interior, and weight measures are used in Shanghai. It is inconvenient to use volume measures for entry and weight measures for exit. However, if the rice merchants in the interior all have the concept of heavy measures as claimed by the Alliance Association, then they will certainly be happy to express their sympathy for the abolition of volume measures and the adoption of weight measures. From now on, packaging and weighing should be used for all transactions, and there is no need to seek convenience. Some people may think that the counting of weights may not be accurate. However, valuable items such as silkworm cocoons are bought and sold entirely by weight, and we have never heard of them being abandoned due to inaccuracy. And the purchase and sale of rice measures worth eight or nine yuan is the only concern because it is feared that they are not accurate, which is also unreasonable. Some people may think that rice has moisture and that transportation takes time. If weight measures are used, the loss is difficult to predict. The moisture of rice is a matter of quality. The quality is good or bad, and there is a market price to distinguish it. Weight measures are used to calculate the quantity of rice, and what does it have to do with moisture? Moreover, the time it takes for imported rice and Hunan, Anhui, and Jiangxi rice to be transported to Shanghai is the same as in the interior. However, we have never heard of anyone complaining about the weight measures due to the moisture of rice. The above-mentioned rice purchases and sales should be changed to weight measures, which is fair for entry and exit and leaves no room for doubt. Therefore, since the Alliance Association accused the use of heavy measures and obstructed transportation, the association believes that the most straightforward and fair way to resolve this dispute is to abolish volume measures and adopt weight measures. If we abandon this and use a funnel, the Shanghai Bureau of Weights and Measures has conducted a trial, and according to the results of the trial, it is considered to be inconvenient in many ways. It takes 18 seconds to measure each measure with a funnel, while it only takes 3 seconds with a basket. It is estimated that the daily rice trade in this city is about 13,000 measures, and it is not allowed by time to measure rice with a funnel. This is an indisputable fact in the report of Director Zhou. Now the Alliance Association is still crying as if it is impossible not to use a funnel, and it is really unclear what they intend. Now, the Alliance Association has obstructed transportation for more than half a month. If we do not take urgent action, the food supply for the citizens of this city will be in danger of panic. Therefore, we are urgently and fully appealing for your review, and quickly send official letters to the Shanghai County Government where Minhang is located and the Jiading County Government where Huangdu is located. On the one hand, strictly order the Municipal Public Security Bureau to send police to go to the respective county police officers to strictly arrest and punish the lawless thugs who are obstructing rice navigation. On the other hand, allow the abolition of volume measures and the adoption of weight measures, and order the Alliance Association to resume navigation as soon as possible to maintain law and order and to protect people's food. We cannot but await your orders in trepidation. Respectfully submitted to Mayor Wu of the Shanghai Municipal Government."</p>

<p>The Dagong Agency reports that the Municipal Party Headquarters and the Social Affairs Bureau conducted a final decision on the selection of leveled measures, funnels, and the adoption of weight measures at 2 p.m. yesterday. However, because the rice industry groups are complex and opinions are divided, the original plan has been completely changed. It is planned to formulate another compromise solution and convene rice industry groups again on the 9th of this month for public discussion.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Recruitment Team of the China Aviation Association has already begun recruiting members. The results of each team have progressed rapidly. Yesterday, it was reported that Cheng Yujie, the leader of the 343rd team of the association, hosted team members at the Hongyun Restaurant to discuss the progress of the work. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e127">Team Leader's Report <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>"Everyone, today I, as an individual, invite you all here for a reason. That is, to burden you with a great and glorious cause. Some of you may be aware of it. Your kind attendance not only makes me personally happy, but also shows the spirit of our national unity. On March 2nd, I was appointed by Wu Tiecheng, the Mayor of Shanghai and the leader of the Shanghai Recruitment Team of the China Aviation Association, as the leader of the Shanghai Recruitment Team of the China Aviation Association. I feel that I am talented and weak and unable to shoulder this important responsibility. However, I think this matter is an important plan for saving the country. Every man has a responsibility, and it is our duty to do so. Everyone knows that the violent Japanese have ambitious intentions and are in a position to take an inch and make an ell. It is not enough to seize our three provinces, and they are still invading Rehe and disturbing Peiping and Tianjin. The relationship is far above the January 28th Songhu incident. The life of our country and nation is tied to this move. At this critical moment, we can only implement the slogan of 'soldiers do not hesitate to die, and people do not hesitate to spend money' to do the actual work of saving the country. Mayor Wu told us, 'Empty talk about saving the country is of no use. Now you have a practical opportunity. Please save expenses and donate to purchase airplanes, and please join the China Aviation Association as a member. The front-line troops are fighting desperately, and we must fight together. We cannot take up guns to fight, but we should do our best to donate money to buy airplanes to help them fight. Everyone, get up and help buy airplanes!' We must know that the help that Mayor Wu said is not helping Mayor Wu personally, but helping the Republic of China. In other words, it is helping us."</p>

<p>Countries Are Too Busy to Take Care of Themselves and Cannot Afford to Help Others</p>
<p>Hoping That the People Will Wake Up, Rise Up, and Save Themselves</p>
<p>Kong Xiangxi, the special envoy sent by the National Government to Europe and the United States to investigate industries, went abroad in mid-September last year and traveled to various countries in Europe and the United States for half a year. Yesterday, at 7:30 p.m., he took the Italian postal ship Conte Verde to return to Shanghai. After Kong landed, he went straight to his private residence to rest and meet with reporters from various newspapers to talk about his impressions of his travels in Europe and the United States. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e129">Welcome at the Port <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>Around 6 p.m. yesterday evening, those who went to the Hongkou Gonghexiang Pier to welcome him included Mayor Wu Tiecheng, Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan Chu Minyi, Mrs. Sun Yat-sen Soong Ching-ling, former Vice Minister of Industry Zheng Hongnian, Zhao Jinqing, Jianghai Customs Superintendent Tang Hai'an, Secretary Tang Zhaoshi, former Foreign Minister Wang Zhengting, Director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau Wen Hongen, Secretary Zhao Tiezhang of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Office in Shanghai, Dean Song's wife, Ms. Zhang Le Yi, as well as Kong's wife Soong Ai-ling, and Soong Zi-liang, Soong Zi-an, National League of Nations Transportation Commissioner Qi Ya Long, as well as former colleagues of the Ministry of Industry, totaling more than 100 people.</p>
<h3 id="e130">Arrival in Shanghai <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>The Italian ship Conte Verde, on which Kong was traveling, entered Wusongkou at 5:30 p.m. yesterday and docked at the Gonghexiang Pier on East Broadway at 7 p.m. After the gangway was set up, Mrs. Kong, accompanied by Soong Ching-ling and Soong Zi-liang, was the first to board the ship. Then, the welcomers also followed each other up. Kong's secretaries Xu Jianping and Customs Superintendent Tang Hai'an received them. The welcomers entered the first-class cabin hall to meet with Kong. Kong shook hands with Sun Yat-sen's wife, Wang Zhengting, Wu Tiecheng, Chu Minyi, and other dignitaries, as well as other welcomers, and exchanged pleasantries. He then disembarked at 7:40 p.m. and took a car with Mrs. Kong back to his residence on West Ams Road in the French Concession to rest.</p>
<h3 id="e131">Report to Chiang <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>Those who came with Kong were still the three secretaries who went with him: Zhu Maocheng, Xu Jianping, and Li Tang. In addition, Zheng Yanfang, the secretary of the Chinese delegation sent by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to attend the League of Nations conference in Geneva, also came on the same ship as Kong. After landing, Zheng took a car to the hotel to rest. After Kong and others arrived at the residence, Song Ziwen, the Acting President of the Executive Yuan, had already arrived. They talked for a while and telegraphed Chairman Chiang to report that he had returned to Shanghai safely.</p>
<h3 id="e132">Impressions of Traveling Abroad <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>Kong then met with reporters from various newspapers at his residence and first described his impressions of his trip to Europe and the United States. The deepest impression I got from this trip to Europe and the United States was that although all countries are in extremely difficult situations, they are still able to work together to find solutions. Take the United Kingdom as an example. The war debt issue, the unemployment issue, and the Irish issue are pressing down layer upon layer. However, the United Kingdom is still able to overcome all difficulties and deal with them in an unusually thorough manner. Take Germany as an example. After the European War, Germany was almost bankrupt. Unemployment was everywhere. Not only did university graduates have no way out, but even those with specialized skills could not find a place to make a living. Although Germany was in this desperate situation, it still made every effort to cope. The reason why Hitler was able to gain the belief of a small number of people in this election was that the German people hoped that Hitler could concentrate power in the central government to save Germany from its predicament. Take Italy as an example. Italy was divided and chaotic in the past few decades. Even the trains were often delayed for four or five hours. However, since Mussolini came to power, Italy has become a new emerging power. The Italian ship that I took today takes only 25 days from Europe to the East, and its speed is unmatched by other countries' ships. In short, there have been many changes in European countries after the war, but they are all urgently seeking self-rescue and have no time to pay attention to the East. Although the League of Nations has passed reports, it is unlikely to make further substantive sanctions. The same is true for the United States. It is indeed well-disposed towards us, but it cannot shed blood and fight for us. In short, now that the national crisis has reached this point, we can only work together to save ourselves. As for the results of my investigation into the industries and economy of Europe and the United States, I will disclose them all at a later date."</p>

<p>Kong continued, "While I was on the ship, I heard the news of the fall of Chifeng and Chengde and felt even more indignant. When I was in Europe, there were many people in various countries who upheld justice and expressed sympathy, but because of various difficult problems, they could not give us substantive assistance. Heaven helps those who help themselves. The Chinese people should be aware of this. People from all countries are also asking why China does not unite against foreign countries in the midst of national disasters, but instead hopes that other countries will take up their grievances. It is known that relying on others is unreliable, and Japan is even carrying out various insults and national propaganda in Europe and the United States to confuse international public opinion. How should our country unite from top to bottom and defend against insults with strength to show our country's determination to resist the violence of others? Otherwise, we can only sit and listen to being slaughtered."</p>
<h3 id="e134">To Nanjing Via Japan <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>Kong said at the end, "When I passed through Hong Kong this time, I made an appointment with Mr. Hu Zhantang, but because of the urgency of time, I was unable to meet with him. I plan to go to Nanjing via Japan in the next few days to report everything to the Central Government." After Kong finished speaking, someone asked if he would be going to the post of Minister to Italy. Kong resolutely replied, "Now is not the time to be a Minister. We must rush to the border and join the front line to fight the enemy to the death!"</p>
<p>"We Chinese citizens are our own. Today, I am grateful to all of you who are present, although you are my personal friends, but you all have great prestige in the military, political, business, academic, and other circles in this city. I know that you are very enthusiastic about the cause of saving the country. So today, I sincerely invite you to be members of our team. The letters of invitation will be sent separately. I also hope that you will give us more guidance today, either on the recruitment of members of the Aviation Association, or on the current serious situation. I would like to raise a glass of clear wine to wish you good health and to work hard to carry out the 'aviation to save the country' movement and complete the great cause of 'aviation to save the country.'"</p>

<h3 id="e141">Geneva Newspaper Editor William Martin Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>To Investigate the Situation in China and Give Lectures</p>
<p>Short Stay Before Traveling to Other Places</p>
<p>William Martin, editor-in-chief of the Geneva Newspaper, held firm to justice after the Northeast China Incident between China and Japan, and repeatedly published articles in his edited newspaper, criticizing the rampant behavior of violent Japan, which has attracted the attention of world public opinion. Martin believes that the importance of the Sino-Japanese Incident is actually related to the peace of the whole world, and in order to seek the truth, he set off from Geneva last month to come to China to conduct on-the-spot investigations of everything. He arrived in Shanghai on the Italian ship Conte Verde at 7 o'clock last night. The Central News Agency reporter met him on the ship. According to his talks, he came to China this time to investigate the situation in China on the one hand, and also planned to give several lectures, mainly on the world peace issue and the Sino-Japanese issue. He plans to stay in Shanghai for a short time before traveling to other places. However, since he is new to China, he is not familiar with everything. At this time, he has not been able to predetermine the itinerary. He deeply hopes that all parties here will give guidance. He also said that when he left Geneva, the report of the Nineteen Committee had not yet been passed, but the attitude of the League of Nations in upholding justice was quite clear. Although it is impossible to predict how the situation will develop in the future, China has actually won a moral victory. The reporter also asked for his opinion on the Rehe incident, and he said that when the Rehe incident occurred, he was on the road and had very little information, so he could not express any opinion.</p>

<p>After 7:30 Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>Passing Through Qishuyan Station</p>
<p>Derailed Due to Incorrectly Switched Points</p>
<p>At 7:35 yesterday morning, the Jinghu Railway's northbound freight train No. 335 derailed at Qishuyan Station because the pointsman at the station mistakenly switched the points, causing the locomotive to derail and sink, crushing two steel rails and two sleepers. Traffic was completely blocked. The stationmaster immediately sent an urgent telegram for help. Subsequently, senior staff from the railway's Changzhou-based traffic, engineering, and machinery departments supervised workers, dispatched a rescue train, and went to repair the line. The main line was temporarily reconnected at 11:30 am to allow trains to pass, but trains could not cross, and the speed had to be reduced. The derailed locomotive was put back on the track at 1:45 pm, and then both the main and branch lines were repaired, and the work was completed at 6:10 pm. Therefore, yesterday's north- and southbound trains on the Jinghu Railway were delayed by several hours.</p>

<p>Tagged and Sealed by the Executive Yuan in the Afternoon</p>
<p>Iron Net Constructed All Around Under Strict Martial Law</p>
<p>The Guowen News Agency reports that 1,054 boxes of antiquities from the Palace Museum in Beiping were transported to Shanghai the day before yesterday and stored at the former site of Renji at 26 Tianzhutang Street. The entire storage process was not completed until 8 pm the night before. At that time, the authorities of the Chinese and French concessions dispatched police to guard and protect the site. All warehouse doors were sealed with seals from the Executive Yuan. Yesterday, the reporter returned to the site and saw Secretary Wu Ying and his staff affixing Executive Yuan seals to each box and assigning numbers. At 11 am, Song Ziwen, acting President of the Executive Yuan, and Li Zongdong, Secretary-General of the Museum, personally went to the warehouse to inspect the antiquities. Not long after, Liu Hongsheng, manager of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, also arrived to visit. Song left after staying for about 20 minutes. According to Secretary Wu Ying, the date for the shipment of the second batch of transported antiquities has not yet been set. Secretary-General Li Zongdong will not go to Beijing today. The antiquities are related to the national essence, so they were escorted from Peiping to Shanghai. In addition to a portion of the staff remaining in Beijing, eight staff members, including Yi Xianmo and Na Zhiliang, led by me (Wu referred to himself), have come here to manage the antiquities temporarily. No management office or similar name will be set up downstairs. Only one room will be opened as a dormitory for care. After the conversation, the reporter departed and saw that an iron net had been constructed around the warehouse. Wooden posts had also been erected along the open space on the side of Tianzhutang Street to build an iron net, but a pit was dug in the middle, presumably for guards to stay. A small house was built on the northeast corner of the platform on the sixth floor for observation. The entrance was guarded by Annamese police. There was a guard at every door inside, so the protection was very strict.</p>

<p>Opposing Foreign Interference with China's Authority</p>
<p>Statement to be Issued and Meeting Scheduled with Various Sectors</p>
<p>The China Factory Inspection Association held an interim meeting yesterday afternoon at the Eight Immortals Bridge Public Welfare Association. Thirty-odd members attended, including Shen Risheng and Wang Rangcheng. Tian Heqing was the chairman, and Li De was the recording secretary. First, the chairman reported the purpose of the meeting: (1) Major tragedies have occurred successively in the Zhengtai and Yonghe rubber factories in the city, and people from all walks of life feel the importance of factory safety. The association plans to prepare a periodical to disseminate safety knowledge; (2) The follow-up measures for disasters in factories are not entirely consistent with laws and regulations. Should the association make any statement? (3) The authorities in the Shanghai Special Zone have repeatedly obstructed the Chinese government from sending personnel to inspect factories in the Special Zone, and there are many obstacles to the progress. This move by the authorities in the Special Zone has no legal basis, but it has a huge impact on both factories and workers. The association is more aware of the situation and should explain it to all parties. After the report, the discussion began. (1) Regarding the association's periodical, it was resolved to postpone publication due to economic reasons; (2) Regarding the follow-up measures for the disasters in the Zhengtai and Yonghe rubber factories, it was resolved that since there are clear provisions in the Factory Law, the association does not need to make a statement for the time being; (3) Regarding how the Shanghai Special Zone authorities should be made to stop obstructing the Chinese government from sending personnel to inspect factories, it was resolved that: A. The association should issue a statement explaining the process of the Special Zone authorities obstructing factory inspections and the reasons why it is inappropriate to seize factory inspection authority; B. The association should regularly invite the local press and invite industrial and commercial groups to discuss everything; (4) Regarding establishing a Chinese factory inspection system, it was resolved that a request should be submitted to the central government to quickly establish a Chinese factory inspection system so that it can be implemented in various places as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Deputy Commander Xu Jingde has Arrived to Await Him</p>
<p>Xu Discussed the Bitter Battle Against Japan in Heilongjiang Province</p>
<p>The Central News Agency reports that since General Ma Zhanshan left Heilongjiang for Russia, all of General Ma's troops have been under the command of Xu Jingde, Deputy Commander of Heilongjiang Province. Xu recently heard that General Ma will return to China soon, so he came to Shanghai via Heilongjiang to await General Ma's arrival before returning to his defense area to plan the recovery of the lost territory. The Central News Agency reporter visited Xu at his residence yesterday and asked about the recent situation in Heilongjiang Province. He was pleased to be interviewed and answered in detail as follows.</p>
<h3 id="e154">Experience of Bitter Battles <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>According to Xu, I am from the Northeast and belong to the military. Since the September 18th Incident, Chairman Ma Zhanshan took charge of the Heilongjiang government and engaged in anti-Japanese work. I was involved in the Jiangqiao and Daxing battles. On the 4th of last month, Chairman Ma went to Heihe to re-establish the provincial government. Not long after, he personally led troops. At that time, he ordered me to be the commander of the Heihe garrison and acting deputy commander, staying behind to coordinate all routes. For several months, along the upper and lower reaches of Heihe, for defense, China advanced and occupied Nenjiang to the south to spy on Nehe, and advanced and occupied Luobei to the east to plot Suibin. The enemy repeatedly attacked the two routes in the middle but were repelled. Suibin, the fundamental place, was once recovered. The defense was consolidated. However, Heihe is known to be barren, and the people's food and various materials are extremely lacking. Bullets, the only necessary military item, have no source. Troops and volunteers from all routes requested pay and ammunition, causing me to feel exhausted. It took great effort to cope for several months, and Heihe became increasingly empty. At this time, Chairman Ma was stationed in Nehe, planning to attack the Harbin station, and urged the Su and Zhang armies in Hailar and Zhalantun to take action. He also went to discuss strategy, hoping to make unified progress and restore the provincial capital. Unexpectedly, the situation changed after Chairman Ma arrived in Zhalantun. Because he was isolated and unable to return, Chairman Ma withdrew into Russian territory via Manchuria, hoping to return to China and plan a major campaign.</p>
<h3 id="e155">Waiting for an Opportunity to Act <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>However, after resolving the Hailar-Manzhouli issue, the enemy concentrated its forces to attack Heihe. I originally planned to concentrate the troops and defend the Xing'an Mountains, fighting the violent Japanese to the death. However, the pay and ammunition were too scarce. Although I had the determination to die, I had no means to fight the enemy. As a last resort, I handed over the various units under my command to Chief of Staff Wang and the brigade commanders to maintain order and secretly gave them instructions to temporarily lie dormant in the various counties, totaling 16,000 people. I instructed them to wait for an opportunity to act. In addition, there were commander Pu Bingshan's army, Cai Hongyou's army, Nan Tingfang's army, Zhang Xishi's unit, and Xu Haiting's unit, totaling 50,000 to 60,000 people, who were all out of ammunition and food, thinly clothed, and unable to fight. They were lying dormant in various counties. Army Commander Xu Haiting, due to his old age, fought bitterly in the Laha station and Nehe area for several days. His arm was affected by rheumatism and he has already come to Shanghai for medical treatment. Army Commander Zhang Xishi is said to have also arrived in Beiping, requesting assistance.</p>
<h3 id="e156">Ma's Impending Arrival in Shanghai <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>I have heard that Chairman Ma [Likely refers to a prominent figure named Ma, potentially relating to political or military leadership] is soon to arrive in Shanghai. He will discuss a comprehensive plan for recovering lost territories with the central government and military authorities in North China. He disguised himself and changed his name, detouring through Vladivostok to Shanghai. He is currently suffering from heart disease due to the overwhelming stimulation. He intends to rest and recuperate in Shanghai for a while. After Chairman Ma returns to the country, he will follow him again, jointly deliberating on measures to save the situation. However, I, as a soldier, bear heavy military responsibilities. I failed to defend even a small corner of pure land on the border, leading to the retreat of the Heilongjiang provincial government. I am filled with shame. This time, I left with tears and intense grief. Therefore, I am unwilling to express myself much to the press. Since you have inquired, I must briefly recount my experiences. Chairman Ma has already left Vawkas. He should arrive in Shanghai in the shortest possible time.</p>

<h3 id="e162">The Shanghai East Refusal to Cut-Off Water Association Petitioned the Municipal Council Yesterday <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>Commissioner He Dekui Received Them, but Talks Were Unfruitful</p>
<p>The Municipal Council Board Meeting Will Discuss It Tomorrow</p>
<p>The Shanghai East Refusal to Cut-Off Water Joint Committee dispatched six representatives yesterday morning to submit a petition to the Municipal Council, requesting it to promptly order the water company to resume water supply immediately to protect people's lives. The details of the petition are as follows:</p>
<p>Petition Situation: The petition representatives of the association petitioned the Municipal Council authorities at approximately 10:00 AM yesterday. Commissioner He Dekui received them. The representatives described the suffering after the water cut-off and requested the water company to hand over water meters and resume water supply immediately. The response was that discussions are currently underway among all parties, and significant progress has been made. After the matter is submitted to the board meeting on Wednesday, a resolution will be made. The representatives felt that such statements had already appeared in the newspapers and requested the director-general to respond personally. Since the director-general was unavailable, they dispersed without any results.</p>
<p>Petition: Respectfully submitted. It is found that the British-owned Shanghai Waterworks Company has been using water cut-offs in the eastern districts of Shanghai to coerce the collection of a huge sum of water fees calculated according to the water meter. As a result, residents have no water to cook with and their lives are in imminent danger. This association's responsibility is related, so Qiu Jialiang, Chen Baoshi, Chen Xintian, Qu Qinghua, Wang Yaozeng, and Gao Yiqun have been specially sent to visit the director-general to present the difficult situation in person. We earnestly request that the water company be ordered to restore the water supply immediately and reject the household water meter installation system to save people's livelihoods. We would be eternally grateful.</p>
<p>Company Statement: According to reliable sources, after mediation on the water fees by relevant parties, the water company stated that there must be restrictions on residents' water use, with a limit of seven gallons per person per day. For example, in each building, calculated with sixteen people, the monthly water usage needs 3360 gallons. Calculated at six jiao and four fen per 1,000 gallons, the total is two yuan and eight fen. If the above quota is exceeded, fees will be charged as usual. It is now being strongly argued by relevant parties that at least 23 gallons per person per day must be supplied (because there are also restrictions in Europe and the United States with a limit of 23 gallons per person per day). The water fee is calculated as one-tenth of the rent. Negotiations are currently underway, and if there are results, they will be submitted to the Municipal Council board meeting tomorrow (Wednesday) for discussion and decision.</p>
<p>Seeking Equal Treatment: The Zhoujia Pai Road and Shuncheng Li on Yangshupu Road in eastern Shanghai have been very desolate since the January 28th Incident. In light of the suffering of businessmen, the landlords have automatically reduced rents. The monthly rent for each store in that area is only 30 yuan, and since June of last year, it has been reduced by 20%. Therefore, the relationship between landlords and tenants is very harmonious. The housing in Shuncheng Li belongs to the same landlord, but the treatment is different. This has caused dissatisfaction among the tenants. They have organized an autonomous association to request that the landlord treat everyone equally and reduce rents by 20%. However, the landlord has procrastinated until now and has not fulfilled this request. Suffering again from the pain of the water cut-off, an autonomous association meeting was convened the day before yesterday and resolved to deposit the most recent rent due into the Trust Department of the Bank of China to promote the landlord's awareness and achieve the goal of rent reduction.</p>
<h3 id="e163">Zheng Xitang's Fatal Record <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>The Coffin Will Be Sealed Tomorrow at the China Funeral Parlor</p>
<p>Zheng Xitang, a giant in the aviation industry, was kidnapped by local bandits at the Xintai Wharf in the South City on the afternoon of the eleventh of last month. He struggled to escape but was shot in the back of the head, and his Russian bodyguard, Sadif, was killed. Zheng Jin died in the hospital from illness. After Zheng was injured, he was taken by car to Shanghai Hospital and then to the Red Cross Hospital in Hongkou, where he was placed in Room 15. Western doctors attempted to remove the bone fragments and shrapnel from the edge of his skull and gave him pain-relieving medicine. His condition improved, and his appetite was reduced, and he could eat milk and thin porridge. However, his bowel movements were blocked, requiring a machine to extract them. After two weeks, the wound became inflamed again, and his old kidney problems were triggered, causing his fever to increase daily. The doctors were helpless. Finally, his friend Lu Bohong (a director of the Red Cross Hospital) accompanied a well-known Western doctor to the hospital to examine his condition and attempt to save him. Upon examination, although Zheng's brain had not been damaged by the bullet, fragments of Zheng's hair had become embedded in his brain, making it impossible to remove them. The hair fragments caused inflammation in the brain, making him difficult to save. He passed away at 11:40 PM on the fifth night. His body was taken by car to the China Funeral Parlor at 670 Haig Road. The coffin will be sealed at 2:00 PM on the eighth (tomorrow). Zheng was 41 years old and had four sons and two daughters. The eldest son, Yinian, has entered the business world and inherited his father's business. Zheng had a wide circle of friends. While he was in the hospital, friends in Shanghai came to visit, and his secretary, Xu Wanli, and others handled the reception. There will certainly be many mourners at the sealing of the coffin tomorrow.</p>
<h3 id="e164">The Butler's Dream of Wealth <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>Stealing His Master's Diamond Ring and Cash</p>
<p>Traveling to Tiger Hill and Returning to Shanghai</p>
<p>Enjoying Harlots All Day at the Hotel</p>
<p>Being Arrested One Day, Joy Turns to Sorrow</p>
<p>Zhang Acai, from Ningbo, is 30 years old. He has been working as a butler for a Frenchman named Maitai (transliteration) at No. 603 Haig Road, French Concession. From the 3rd to the 27th of last month, he successively stole five diamond rings worth 16,500 francs and 851 yuan in cash from his master's room. After absconding in private, the victim discovered the theft and reported it to the police for arrest. After Zhang committed the theft, he and his friend Chen Aming (24 years old) each had a stylish pair of jodhpurs made, as well as new robes and clothing. Each wearing a diamond ring, they acted like wealthy young men, traveling to Suzhou together. They stayed at a hotel at night, touring scenic spots such as Tiger Hill during the day. One day, they happened to pass in front of a photography studio on Xin Xian Qian Street, where they saw a woman idly gazing outside. Zhang and others immediately went forward to tease her. (According to reports, the woman's surname is Liu, named Zhifen, 18 years old, and is a foster daughter-in-law of the photography studio.) The woman thought Zhang and others were handsome young men, each wearing dazzling diamond rings, mistaking them for wealthy young masters. She was moved, so she did not refuse and even struck up a conversation with them. She was soon lured to the hotel and slept with them for several nights. Later, they encountered a prostitute named Wang Xiuying at the same place. After talking, they felt like they had met late in life. Then, on the 3rd of this month, Zhang and others brought Wang Xiuying and Liu Zhifen to Shanghai, staying in Room 376 of the Dongfang Hotel on Xizang Road. Soon after, they became acquainted with Wang Fengbao, a prostitute at No. 280 Huile Li, and gave each prostitute a diamond ring. The prostitutes were overjoyed to have met such generous customers, and they accompanied them all day, never leaving their side. The sound of laughter reached outside. Unexpectedly, sadness came from within. The matter was discovered by detectives Kang Guangfu and Bao Tan Gu Mingzhou of the French police. They rushed to the Dongfang Hotel the day before yesterday and arrested all the above people, seizing the original stolen diamond rings and other items. Yesterday, they were escorted to the Second Special Court Criminal Division II. First, the police lawyer Gu Shouxi explained the case, stating that the case still needs to be investigated and requesting a rescheduling of the hearing. Judge Zhang Renkan questioned each defendant and then ordered Zhang and Chen to be returned to custody. Wang Fengbao was released on bail. The two women, Wang Xiuying and Liu Zhifen, were sent by the police to the Suzhou Public Security Bureau for disposition. The case was rescheduled for the 13th.</p>
<h3 id="e165">Oversupply of Doctors in Shanghai <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>Income Does Not Cover Expenses, and Living is Difficult</p>
<p>According to Zhu Dianxuan, president of the Rural Medical Improvement Society, the society recently conducted a survey of doctors in Shanghai and discovered the alarming oversupply of doctors in the city. There are 413 Western doctors and 2018 Chinese medicine doctors (not including unlicensed doctors). More than 80% of them have incomes that do not cover their expenses, and living is very difficult. As a result, various unethical behaviors arise. In fact, there is not a nationwide oversupply of doctors. Currently, there are approximately 400,000 doctors in China, which means there is one doctor for every 1,000 people, similar to the ratio in England. Therefore, it has not reached a truly excessive level. The reason is that in recent years, the rural economy has collapsed, and farmers' lives are mostly unable to support themselves. When they are sick, they often have no ability to seek medical treatment, relying on the natural changes of the disease. As a result, rural doctors are forced by life to run to the cities. The increase in the number of Chinese medicine doctors in Shanghai in the past three years alone shows the tendency of doctors to move to the cities. There were 436 more in 1920, 375 more in 1921, and 605 more in 1922 (last year). This trend is enough to further exacerbate the rural medical famine, which is the biggest crisis for the nation's future. Therefore, the mutual academic attacks in recent years between the Chinese and Western medical communities are meaningless. The fundamental problem is the high national population mortality rate and how to lower it, how to provide relief to the more than 20 million sick and suffering patients, and how to ensure the livelihoods of the majority of unemployed doctors. These are all urgent problems that the medical community itself needs to solve and are the only way to actively save the country.</p>
<h3 id="e166">Yesterday's Meeting of the United Association for the Murder of Chinese by Vietnamese Police, Resolving to Petition the Municipal Government Tomorrow and Requesting Assistance from Du Yuesheng in Negotiations <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>The case of the Vietnamese police officer of French Concession Police Station No. 427 shooting and killing a Chinese person has aroused public outrage from all sectors. Various organizations have formed a United Association for Aiding the Victims, appointing responsible personnel to conduct negotiations. The association held its first meeting yesterday, resolving several important matters. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Collective Discussion of Response: Yesterday afternoon at 3 PM, the United Association for Aiding the Victims of the French Concession Tragedy, convened its first committee meeting at the fourth floor of the Ningbo Native Place Association. Attendees included Zheng Zhengqiu, Qu Zhenhua, Cao Zhigong, Jiang Junyi, Zheng Ziliang, Dong Xinfang, Gu Wensheng, Wu Mai, and over ten others. Chairman Zheng Zhengqiu reported on the previous day's contact with Du's residence and read aloud the draft letter to Du Yuesheng requesting assistance in negotiations. Then, the meeting commenced with discussions on: (1) The matter of publicly appointing persons responsible for drafting various letters and telegrams. It was resolved to appoint Cao Zhigong and Zhang Shenzhi as the responsible persons. (2) The matter of publicly appointing representatives to the Municipal Government to request serious negotiations. It was resolved to appoint Zheng Zhengqiu, Jiang Junyi, Zhang Shenzhi, Qu Zhenhua, Ye Xianggao, and five others to go. (3) The matter of researching and estimating the losses of the bereaved families. It was resolved to publicly appoint six lawyers, Wu Kaisheng, Tu Zhenhu, Cai Xiaobai, Guo Qimin, Dai Jinghuai, and Qu Shao Yi, to conduct research. In addition to sending letters, each fellow-villagers association will separately contact the respective lawyers to investigate the situation of the families of the victims tomorrow morning. At 5 PM, they will meet at the Ningbo Native Place Association to discuss compensation methods, draft them in writing, and leave them to representative Zhang Shenzhi to take to the Municipal Government. (4) It was decided to hold the second committee meeting at 5 PM on Wednesday, at the same address at the Ningbo Native Place Association. The meeting adjourned.</p>
<p>Letter to Du Yuesheng: The Association sent a letter yesterday to Du Yuesheng, Chairman of the Chinese Ratepayers Association of the French Concession, stating: "Respected Sir, On the 25th of last month, the case of the Vietnamese police officer of French Concession Police Station No. 427 indiscriminately shooting and killing multiple people has caused deep indignation among the citizens. Not only should the victims be assisted, but it also concerns the safety of all citizens in the concession thereafter. Various organizations in this city especially convened a meeting yesterday at the Ningbo Native Place Association to discuss response measures. It was resolved to organize the Shanghai United Association for Aiding the Victims of the French Concession Tragedy to manage the proceedings. The demands are as follows: (1) In accordance with Chinese law, the murderer must be severely punished and executed locally. (2) Generous compensation should be given to the deceased and medical treatment provided to the injured. (3) Assurance must be given that the same unfortunate incident will not occur again in the future. (4) The police station must show respect. (5) Vietnamese police officers should be replaced to avoid further incidents caused by language barriers and ignorance of local customs. (6) The practice of two people riding in one vehicle should be abolished, and reference should be made to the methods used in the Chinese and Public Concessions. Those who are mistakenly arrested should be handled flexibly, considering the circumstances. Zheng Zhengqiu, Jiang Junyi, Zhang Shenzhi, Tu Zhenhu, Cao Zhigong, Qu Zhenhua, Tong Lizhang, and others have been nominated as representatives to visit your office to request that you uphold justice and actively negotiate. Your immediate attention to this matter is urgently requested. It is hoped that you will provide assistance in negotiations, and actively proceed to uphold justice and ensure protection. This would be greatly appreciated."</p>

<p>The weather in this city has been very cold recently, with temperatures dropping close to zero degrees. Yesterday was especially severe, with the northwest wind howling incessantly. Pedestrians on the roads were all huddled up. Around 4 AM, it even snowed in spring. Upon waking up in the morning, the roofs were all white. The cold wind during the day was bone-chilling, and it was necessary to light a stove indoors to ward off the cold.</p>
<h3 id="e168">The Municipal Council Replied to Two Important Letters from the Ratepayers Association Yesterday <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese Ratepayers Association received two reply letters from the Public Concession Municipal Council yesterday. Excerpts are recorded below:</p>
<p>Discussion of Tap Water: The Ratepayers Association previously received a letter from the Shanghai Citizens Federation stating that the water bills had increased due to the use of meters for tap water within the concession, and suggested solutions. They forwarded the letter to the Municipal Council for handling. The council replied yesterday, stating, "Your esteemed letter of February 20 is acknowledged. Regarding the water price issue, this council is currently consulting with the Real Estate Association and the Tenant Federation. The opinions expressed by the two associations have been taken into consideration in the hope of reaching a satisfactory solution as soon as possible. This letter is for your information." After receiving the letter, the association forwarded it to the City Federation for their information.</p>
<p>Robbery of Watch Store: The Ratepayers Association previously received a letter from the Shanghai Watch Industry Association regarding the robbery of watch stores and forwarded it to the Public Concession Municipal Council for handling. The council replied yesterday, stating, "Your esteemed letter of February 20 is acknowledged, regarding the letter from the Shanghai Watch Industry Association about the robbery of watch stores. Upon investigation of the Police Department's records, it is found that the claim of robbers especially targeting watch stores in recent years is not supported by facts. From July 1 of last year to February 20 of this year, only two cases occurred in the areas under the jurisdiction of the Lao Zha and Central Police Stations. Considering the large number of watch stores within the concession, these cases are relatively few. Considering the valuable and easily targeted nature of the goods in watch stores, the thoroughness of police protection is evident. In the above-mentioned two cases, one was on Fuzhou Road and the other was on Nanjing Road. The police sentries were only sixty yards and less than twenty-five yards away from the scene of the incident, respectively. The victims did not report the robbery at the time but only called for help after the robbers had fled. Within the above-mentioned time, the Lao Zha Police District alone had fifty-three robbery cases, and eighty-three people were arrested by the police, seventy-one of whom have been sentenced. The effectiveness of the police in dealing with robbers is evident. This letter is for your information." The association has forwarded the letter to the Watch Industry Association for their information.</p>

<p>At the Shanghai Municipal Bede Elementary School at No. 1197 Route Lafayette in the French Concession, a young man dressed in a long gray cloth gown, basketball shoes, and tortoise-shell glasses, with a tall and sturdy build, suddenly barged into the school around 1 PM yesterday, holding several bank notes and throwing them on the doorman's table. When the doorman asked him why, the man replied, "Take it for expenses," and then left the school heading east. The doorman immediately reported the incident to Principal Wang Dingcheng, who reported it to the Baojian Road Police Station by telephone. Detective Gao Chaozhen was dispatched to the school to take the money to the police station so that the young man's family could identify and claim it.</p>
<h3 id="e172">Chen Xianglin's Nationality Issue <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>Arrested by the Public Security Bureau for Promoting Communism and About to be Handed Over, He Suddenly Claimed to be of Japanese Nationality, Unexpectedly, the Japanese Consulate Was About to Arrest Him, and Chen Then Claimed to Have Escaped from a Revolution in Taiwan to Shanghai</p>
<h3 id="e173">As a Result, Chen Was Temporarily Handed Over to the Municipal Council for Detention <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>Chen Xianglin, a Taiwanese, also known as Weng Zesheng, Weng Guosheng, and Li Guoliang, was sentenced to one year in prison by the court in 1919 for promoting communism in Shanghai. Later, on appeal, the sentence was reduced to three months. After serving his sentence, Chen had also been wanted in Taiwan and Hong Kong for promoting communism after he escaped from the island. The Japanese Consulate and the British and French Concession Police Stations in this city all had his photograph and notification. On the afternoon of the 4th of this month, detectives from the Public Security Bureau, acting on orders to arrest him for promoting communism, apprehended him on the way to Wenjian Master Road and escorted him to the police station. On Sunday morning, he was escorted to the High Court Second Branch for questioning. Lawyer Zhan Jifeng represented the Public Security Bureau, requesting that he be handed over for questioning. According to Chen's confession, he was originally from Fujian and denied the alleged promotion. Judge Yu Yeting ruled in court that the defendant be handed over for further investigation. Unexpectedly, after the court's ruling, the defendant suddenly claimed that he was originally from Taiwan and should not be subject to the Chinese court, declaring his opposition. He also claimed that the Japanese Consulate could prove that he was Taiwanese. The police then dispatched Deputy Detective Mao Yiwen to the Japanese Consulate for investigation. It was then learned that the Japanese Consulate was also wanted to arrest him, and the police station also had a record of his case. At 3 PM in the afternoon, Judge Yu held another court session at the Criminal Division One of the High Court. Secretariat Officer Masayuki Hashizume and Mr. Minsan Maeda, who had previously worked at the Taiwan Governor's Office for twenty years, appeared in court on behalf of the Japanese Consulate. According to Masayuki Hashizume, the defendant's original name was Li Guoliang, who was born in Taiwan and was wanted by the authorities for promoting communism. Therefore, he fled to Hong Kong, where he was deported for ten years and then came to Shanghai. Because he came to Shanghai secretly, he has no passport or other documents to verify, but Minsan Maeda, who has worked at the Taiwan Governor's Office for many years, can recognize him. Then, Minsan Maeda said that the defendant was born in the Taipingcho area of Taipei without error. Lawyer Gan Jingxian representing the police stated that now that the defendant has been proven to be of Japanese nationality, he should be handed over to the Japanese Consulate. Lawyer Zhan Jifeng, representing the Public Security Bureau, stated that the defendant had previously been punished by the Chinese court and had not claimed to be of Japanese nationality. Even at the beginning of today's trial, he did not mention his Japanese nationality until the court approved the transfer. Since the Japanese Consulate can prove that he is Taiwanese, the defendant may have dual nationality. Therefore, he requested the court to handle the case according to the law, or temporarily detain him to investigate his nationality before further action. At that time, the defendant suddenly claimed that he had revolted in Taiwan and escaped to Shanghai. Therefore, he opposed the transfer by the Public Security Bureau and the Japanese Consulate and demanded immediate release. The court ordered that he be temporarily handed over to the Municipal Council for detention.</p>

<p>Zhou Changsheng, a 44-year-old local from No. 236 Pinlang Road, worked as a laborer in the weaving section of the Tongxing Yarn Factory at No. 1443 Gordon Road. At around 2:00 PM the day before yesterday, the machine belt suddenly came off the shaft. Zhou then climbed to a height of fifteen feet above the ground to reattach the belt, but lost his balance and his left hand was caught in the belt. He fell to the ground in extreme pain, injuring his head, hands, and other parts. He immediately fainted. Another worker, Li Xiaodi, saw this and immediately reported it to the factory staff, who in turn reported it to the Putuo Road Police Station, ordering detectives to send the injured man to Baolong Hospital for treatment. He died soon after despite the treatment. The body was taken to the Fei Lun Road Coroner's Office. Yesterday morning, the First Special District Court was requested to send Prosecutor Guo Wei to the office to examine the body, take the stand, and record the case. According to the testimony of Li Xiaodi, Zhou was reattaching the belt that day but accidentally attached it to another shaft, causing his left hand to be crushed and him to fall. According to the statement of Zhou Zhou's wife, she requested compensation from the factory. According to the statement of the factory representative, Japanese national Iwabayashi Takeo, the deceased was indeed a worker in the factory. Now that he died on duty, they would give compensation. After receiving the statement, Guo ruled that Zhou Changsheng died from injuries sustained during the fall, and the body was released to his wife Zhou Zhou, who made a written guarantee to take it back for burial.</p>
<h3 id="e175">Flower Gambling Den Cracked Down in Maigen Road <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>Recently, Li Taijin, Xu Anzhi, Wu Yukai, Wang Ali, Xiong Sihai, Liu Xiaokouzi, and others set up a flower gambling den in Shundeli, Maigen Road, Shanghai West. The houses in the neighborhood were newly built, and the house numbers had not yet been assigned. In order to avoid the attention of police detectives, they adopted a modern office-style interior, making it difficult for outsiders to recognize it as a gambling den. However, the detectives Wang Chengying and Liu Chunshu of the Gordon Road Police Station discovered it. Therefore, they rushed to investigate and arrest them the day before yesterday just as the gambling was about to start. They arrested Li Taijin and others, and seized gambling funds, abacuses, and flower gambling notes. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the First Special District Court for questioning. Lawyers Li Zhishan and Zhang Shizhu of the police station came to court and explained the various harms of flower gambling, requesting severe punishment. Judge Liu then interrogated each defendant and sentenced them to punishment according to the circumstances of the crime.</p>

<p>丨Liu Huisheng Accidentally Enters Boiling Water and Scalds to Death丨</p>
<p>Liu Huisheng, a 50-year-old from Jiangbei, was a stone barge boatman. On the 24th of last month, his boat passed through Minhang and he stopped there. He went ashore to take a bath at the First Bathhouse. Unexpectedly, he accidentally entered the boiling water pool. By the time he felt the pain and stood up, the lower half of his body was already red and swollen and the skin had peeled off. He immediately left the bathhouse and collapsed outside, unable to move. He was rushed to the hospital for treatment, but he had been poisoned by the heat and there was no good medicine. He finally died yesterday. Because he had no family members, the township chief reported to the local court for a coroner's examination. Prosecutor Yang An and others were appointed to examine the scene and determined that he had died from scalding. They ruled that if no family members arrived, the bathhouse would arrange for the burial.</p>

<p>We have received a letter from the representative of Hengfeng Company, stating: "We have read with great surprise in your newspaper an article about our company privately importing fire liquor of enemy goods. Since the September 18th Incident, our company has long eliminated enemy goods, and we dare not lag behind others in our patriotic zeal. We do not know where this news came from. In addition to inquiring with the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and publishing advertisements, we have entrusted a letter to your newspaper, hoping that you will investigate and make corrections to avoid confusion."

<p>丨丨From Gu Yingjun丨丨</p>
<p>My life, the happiness of my future, everything about me, is now flying in a storm-like environment. Sometimes I feel sad, but sometimes ideals make me feel excited. My own outlook on life has always been aimless, because of my environment. Therefore, I often think to myself, "Where is the destination of my life?" Ah! I am gradually getting older, I am already a "person" of seventeen years old. I am confident that my will is enough to deal with my environment, but my own knowledge is limited because of the economic constraints of my family in my childhood. It is really pitiful to say that I have not yet reached the level of a primary school graduate. However, because I have been reading newspapers in public reading places every day during the years I have been out of school, this is my only hobby, so I have also gained some practical knowledge. But now, I feel the depression of "the destination of life." Therefore, I live in ideals every day. But I have realized, Mr. Reporter, I will tell you what I will ask for. I am confident that my personality is suitable for studying philosophy, but I am also interested in social sciences and natural sciences, especially in literary research and aesthetic appreciation. Mr. Reporter, my will and my future destination are all clearly dissected in the above-mentioned few points. Therefore, I am now asking a question for you to answer: It is of course possible for me to enter school, so of course, there is only one way for me to study philosophy, social sciences, natural sciences, and literary aesthetics, and that is self-study. But my will is very vague. How should the path of self-study be taken? Mr. Reporter, don't think it's ridiculous. Although I don't have great talent, I firmly believe that my ambition tells me, "I will become a second Goethe (J.W. Goethe)!" Mr. Reporter, do you find it ridiculous? How will I finish reading the books of the above-mentioned subjects? Although books can never be finished, this is another opinion of mine. Please answer me, sir. After that, I would like to ask you to solve a common disease of young people: love. Although love is the most needed thing for young people, I am still very suspicious of love in my current environment. Does love hinder reading? How can I avoid it and not talk about love? How can one be worthy of talking about love? Not the love of mammonism, but the love of Mirl. Due to the urgency of time, everything I wrote is very clumsy and contradictory, so I hope you will understand this.</p>
<p>Answer: After reading your letter, my reply is as follows: (1) Studying does not necessarily require going to school (this is naturally a last resort). You can read books in public reading places and in circulating libraries. Moreover, studying in this way is carried out in the struggle of life. This kind of studying is living study, not dead study. If you want to study philosophy, you can first read the following books: "Fundamental Problems of Social Science" translated by Li Da (Xinxian Bookstore), "Historical Materialism" (Modern Bookstore), "Classics of Dialectics" (Yadong). After reading the above three books, you will naturally find the path to the various sciences you want to study. (2) You "want to be a second Goethe," I advise you not to. Naturally, the 18th-century Goethe is worthy of our admiration. However, at most, our admiration of Goethe as a natural scientist and writer is the same as our admiration of Kant as a natural scientist and philosopher. Neither of them are spokespersons for the working masses. Goethe later became an aristocrat. We modern people do not need a second Goethe, because he cannot represent our call to resist imperialism, and he cannot inspire us to fight against evil forces. We do not need a second Goethe. We at least need a second Gorky, a second Barbusse, a second Sinclair. May you strive for this! (3) Love is not absolutely harmful. However, it is absolutely harmful to a young person who is frivolous in nature, unstable in blood and qi, has little experience, and is under the age of twenty. At least it is 99% harmful, the so-called "more harm than good"! There is no good way to avoid it. You can only make up your mind to study knowledge. If you put in real effort into literature, art, or philosophy and other historical sciences, you will naturally find it very interesting. At that time, your spirit may be attached to something, and you will not talk about love all day long. Finally, I would like to ask, the reporter rarely pays attention to love. What book did you see about the "Mirl-style love" you mentioned? Please teach me.</p>

<h3 id="e184">From Satire to Humor <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>— He Jiagan</p>
<p>A satirist is dangerous.</p>
<p>If what he satirizes are the illiterate, the slaughtered, the imprisoned, and the oppressed, then that's great. It just gives the so-called educated intellectuals who read his articles a chuckle. It makes them feel even braver and more intelligent. However, the reason why satirists today are satirists is precisely because they satirize this group of so-called educated intellectuals.</p>
<p>Because what is satirized is this group of society, each member feels as if they have been stabbed themselves, so they each come out secretly and use their satire to try to stab the satirist to death.</p>
<p>First, they say he is cynical, and gradually they say he is scolding, wisecracking, venomous, hateful, an academic bandit, a Shaoxing lawyer, and so on. However, the satire of society often remains "amazingly long." Even if they bring out a foreign monk or start a tabloid to attack, it is still ineffective. How can this not infuriate people!</p>
<p>The crux is here: what he satirizes is society. If society does not change, this satire will continue to exist. What you stab is him personally. If his satire exists, your satire will fall flat.</p>
<p>Therefore, to overthrow such a hateful satirist, one can only change this society.</p>
<p>However, social satirists are dangerous, especially in an era when some "writers" openly and secretly become "the king's claws." Who is happy to be the protagonist in a "literary inquisition"? But if they don't die completely, there will always be a breath of resentment in their stomach, which they want to spit out with a chuckle, using laughter as a guise. Laughter does not offend others, and there is no provision in the current law that citizens must wear a mourning face. It is not "illegal," so it can be asserted.</p>
<p>I think this is the reason why "humor" has become popular in writing since last year. However, there are naturally many who are simply "laughing for the sake of laughing."</p>
<p>However, this situation will probably not last long. "Humor" is not a domestic product, and the Chinese are not a people who are good at "humor." Moreover, it is really difficult to be humorous now. Therefore, even humor is bound to change its appearance. It either leans towards social satire or falls into traditional "jokes" and "seeking cheap advantages."</p>

<p>— Zhou Leshan</p>
<p>The book "Hu Shih and Guo Moruo," which was heavily advertised in 1932 and published in February 1933, is three inches thick, truly a "massive" work unprecedented. I plan to spend a month of evenings reading it. Tonight, I begin to open the cover. The first page features a portrait of the copyright holder, Mr. Tan, to verify the book's copyright.

<p>— Bo Fu</p>
<p>One</p>
<p>Matsuoka Yosuke told reporters that China's boycott of Japanese goods and purchase of military supplies is tantamount to suicide (see yesterday's newspaper). I suppose Japan is killing China because it doesn't want to see China commit suicide?</p>
<p>Two</p>
<p>Yesterday's newspaper reported that a blind fortune teller fell in love with a blind woman who already had a husband while telling her fortune, and they had a physical relationship. Is love truly blind?</p>
<p>Three</p>
<p>A certain boring publication carried a letter from a reader to Mr. Li Lieh-wen, editor of "Free Talk," calling Mr. Zeng's "lyrics" (?) an immortal work. In fact, Mr. Zeng has already clearly told us "Now it's possible," so why should the reader flatter him excessively?</p>
<p>Four</p>
<p>During the initial period of the Fourth State, one could still hear people singing "Little Sister, I Love You," but it hasn't been heard for a long time now. Perhaps men have all realized that "Little Sister, You Love Me" is the right way, right?</p>
<h3 id="e187">My Lover <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>— Ai Wu</p>
<p>Two idle and bored friends, how annoying, actually started making fun of me. They linked a completely unrelated little woman to me, stubbornly assigning her as my lover; both of them speaking at once, not allowing me to explain at all. As a result, I got angry and retorted with even some unpleasant words. But calmly thinking about it, their unreasonable teasing didn't come out of thin air. Because whenever I heard that little woman singing mournful songs, I would unconsciously reveal a sad mood on my face and in my words.</p>
<p>This laughable and annoying incident happened in the Lockup on the shore of the Indian Ocean in Rangoon; my two friends and I were imprisoned by British imperialism for violating Article X of the Indian government's law, supposedly for committing crimes endangering the local government. It was in early 1931. The room inside the Lockup was quite nice, with electric lights and a Western-style toilet, nothing was lacking. Compared to the Burmese house I lived in in the Alon area outside Rangoon, in any case, my material life could be considered to have greatly stepped up a level. But living there for a long time became annoying, especially since it lacked the essential element of life: freedom. Perhaps because the three Chinese were all political prisoners, we were separated from the other prisoners as soon as we entered; thus, one room became the world occupied by the three of us. And the three of us were quite familiar with each other on the outside, so in this boring world, we simply couldn't find any fresh or interesting stories to talk about. Everyone only created interest by fabricating stories about each other that were neither funny nor annoying. That's how we spent the entire day playing games of teasing each other. There was also one other happy thing, which was that after lunch every day, the Indian guard with the mustache would open the iron gate and let us take a walk on an open-air corridor behind the building, look up at the kind blue sky, and always happily raise our arms, wanting to completely swallow the fresh air into our lungs. Sometimes, seeing an unknown bird flashing its black wings across the clear sky, our fleeting thoughts seemed to be carried away by its wings, and a faint homesickness followed in our lonely hearts. Across the corridor, a row of smaller rooms stood, with sparsely drooping green vines hanging from the eaves, and a black lacquered wooden sign hanging on the door that read "Female Cage." This aroused our curiosity, and every time we took a walk, we would quietly stand under the window for a while, planning to see the female prisoners inside. But every time it was gloomy, filled only with loneliness, without a single figure.</p>
<p>One night, suddenly a woman's singing came from the Female Cage side, and we, who were sitting listlessly, were all captivated by the singing, holding our breath and listening.</p>
<p>"·················"</p>
<p>Ah, I recognize who you are!</p>
<p>Wasn't it you venomous snakes</p>
<p>Who killed my husband in the mango grove?</p>
<p>You burned down my thatched hut,</p>
<p>And now you've arrested me,</p>
<p>Please, if you want to beat me, beat me, if you want to kill me, kill me,</p>
<p>You venomous snakes!</p>
<p>·············"</p>
<p>An Indian man with a mustache shouted loudly to stop her, and the singing stopped immediately, like a broken string on a Chinese violin.</p>
<p>"What a pitiful woman!" This sigh sprang suddenly from my heart as if ejected by a spring. Although my two friends didn't quite understand this Burmese song, the sadness and misery of the female voice also penetrated their hearts; therefore, a pulse of pity and sympathy immediately floated between their eyebrows. Late at night, when the Indian guard with a large bunch of keys on his waist walked to the iron gate to check, we found some things to ask about the female prisoner who sang. From his reluctant mouth, we couldn't find out much, but we roughly knew that the woman with the mournful singing was indeed a "robber woman" captured from the Tharrawaddy District. Who doesn't know that the Tharrawaddy District was the origin of the Burmese peasant riots in December 1930? That woman was undoubtedly the wife of an anti-imperialist warrior. Thus, in my heart, which had pity for her, a solemn respect was unconsciously added. And from the meaning of the woman's song, I understood why the rioting peasants used such a strange flag. Before I was arrested, I had seen a flag seized from the peasants by the British government, a triangular piece of white cloth, depicting a large snake covered in scales, struggling on the ground under the feet of a majestic god. The god had a thunder god's mouth, a small pagoda on his head, and a pair of wings growing on his elbows; his left hand tightly grasped the snake's tail, and the knife in his right hand was in a position to chop it down - this was clearly a silhouette of the British-Burmese struggle, and the giant snake was not exactly a symbol of imperialism poisoning all of Burma?</p>
<p>In 1931 Burma, which was just beginning to roar, a mixed team of footsteps, accompanied by the noise of iron chains, scraped harshly into the gloomy corridor in front of the iron gate every day. Embedding our eyes in the cracks in the iron bars, we saw the shadows of peasants with shaved heads and tattoos, wearing red and green cloth skirts, with worried, brown-yellow, thin faces, passing by one by one. Occasionally, there were also monks wearing yellow kasayas and bare half-arms, drooping their shiny heads, being escorted along with them. But these prisoners, passing through in no more than a day or two, were all reassigned to the Rangoon Central Prison. Remaining in this Lockup were only some prisoners with less serious cases. As for the singing "robber woman," she was detained here for a relatively long time, perhaps just because she was a woman? (To be continued)</p>

<p>— By Xiao Boren, translated by Yi Xian</p>
<p>"What is a 'tie kai'?" the Arab said, smoothing out his long robe to make the pleats lie flat.</p>
<p>"It's a three-cent coin," said the magician. "Why was this made? Because wealthy people are embarrassed to be seen giving me copper coins, and they think that six cents is too much."</p>
<p>"I don't like being treated like that," the Arab said. "Much also has a mission to convey. If my people are left to their own devices, they will prostrate themselves before all the images on the head. If there are no images, they will worship stones. My mission is to convey that only the unique, glorious, and great God has majesty and power. No one has ever dared to make an image of him; if anyone tries to commit such a crime, I will forget God's mercy, overcome my weakness, and simply kill that person with my own hands. Who can imagine the greatness of God in a physical form? Even an excellent image of a horse cannot convey a bit of his beauty, his greatness. Well, when I tell them this, they also ask me to perform magic tricks, and I tell them that I am the same as them, that God himself cannot violate his own laws. If he can imagine doing something unlawful, then they go away and proclaim that I am performing miracles. They also believe, because if they doubt, I have the believers kill them. You should do the same, friend."</p>
<p>"The mission that I convey is that they should not kill each other," said the magician. "People must have a spirit of unity."</p>
<p>"As far as their private disputes are concerned," this is true, the Arab said. "But we must kill those who are not fit to live. It is important to water the garden, but it is also important to pull weeds."</p>
<p>"Who will be the judge of our fitness to live?" said the magician. "The highest government officials, the governors of the empire, and the high priests all think that I am not fit to live. Perhaps they are right."</p>
<p>"As for myself, they made the same decision," said the Arab. "I had to flee. I kept hiding until I told the healthy young men - enough people - that their elders had misunderstood me: in fact, the truth was not like that. So I came back with those healthy young men and pulled weeds in the garden."</p>
<p>"I admire your courage and practical cleverness," said the magician. "But I was not born that way."</p>
<p>"You don't need to admire such qualities," said the Arab. "I feel a little ashamed of this. Aren't all desert elders expressing these qualities well? What I value about myself is the transcendence of my soul, which makes me a medium for divine inspiration. Have you ever written a book?"</p>
<p>"No," the magician said sadly. "I wish I had that ability, then I would earn a lot of money and be able to escape this hateful cross and publish my mission to spread it throughout the world. But I am not a writer. I have compiled a simple prayer, in which, I think, there may be various essences. But God has given me the inspiration to speak, not the inspiration to write."</p>
<p>"Writing is useful," said the Arab. "I was inspired and wrote many chapters of the word of God, may his name be praised! But there are also people in this world who want God to take care of them, but it is impossible. His word means nothing to them; so whenever I have to deal with them, I am no longer inspired and have to rely on my own inventions and my own wit. I write all sorts of terrible stories for them, some about the Last Judgment, some about the hell where evildoers will suffer forever. I contrast these horrors with the paradise prepared for those who do God's will. It is this kind of paradise that will tempt them, you understand! It is a paradise with gardens, fragrances, and beautiful women."</p>

<p>The Provincial Zhenjiang Library in Taiping Bridge, Zhenjiang City, was opened on the 5th. The library has a newspaper reading room, a magazine reading room, and two book reading rooms. The newspaper room has dozens of newspapers from the provincial capital, Beijing-Shanghai, Ping-Han, and English and Japanese newspapers. The magazine room has four or five hundred kinds of Chinese and foreign periodicals of various subjects, all displayed on shelves for people to read. The reference shelves in the book reading room also have dozens of kinds of dictionaries and reference books of various subjects. The card catalogs are full of monthly record cards, arranged by category, making it extremely convenient to check. Those who borrow books fill out forms, and the borrowing procedures are very fast. There is also a survey form for statistics. There are instructors in the room to guide the inspection methods and the use of reference books at any time, which is very thoughtful. The library currently has 30,000 to 40,000 books, and many more are ordered from Pingguang and foreign countries but have not yet arrived. However, the library's location is currently rented, and the location is also relatively remote. It is heard that they are currently planning to build their own building. If a new-style library building can be built in a suitable location, it can become the cultural center of the provincial capital. Yesterday was the first month of opening. According to afternoon statistics, there were more than 300 readers in the newspaper and magazine reading rooms, and about 100 to 200 readers in the book reading room. The books read were mostly in literature and social sciences. The library is open as usual on Sunday mornings and afternoons, and is closed on Monday for holidays. In order to facilitate civil servants, it is also open for two hours every evening from Tuesday to Saturday.</p>

<p>Tsinghua Female Students Sew First Aid Kits; Yenching University Purchases Ten Thousand Steel Helmets</p>
<p>Elementary and Secondary School Students Donate Two Thousand Dollars; Peking University and Normal University are Quiet</p>
<p>(Special dispatch from Beiping) Among the four national universities, seven ministry-run universities, twelve private universities, five private college-level vocational schools, nine municipal middle schools, fifty private middle schools, fifty-eight municipal elementary schools, one hundred and fourteen private elementary schools, twenty-two social education institutions, twenty-four municipal people's schools, and thirty-five private people's schools, a total of 248 schools and institutions with more than 130,000 students, Peking University has always been known as a leading school. During the past May Fourth Movement and the March 18 Massacre, its students suffered the most sacrifices. Since the September 18th Incident, National Tsinghua University, Normal University, the Law School of Peiping University, and private Pingmin University and Yenching University have emerged as rising stars, successively engaging in anti-Japanese movements and being more enthusiastic than Peking University. However, Peking University students are also unwilling to lag behind, so their demonstration southward is different in meaning from the petitions of other universities. However, recently, with the crisis in Rehe, Peiping and Tianjin are in danger, not only Peking University students have not expressed anything, even the Law School, Normal University, and Pingmin University, which were rising stars, have not had any spectacular patriotic movements, only Tsinghua University and Yenching University in the city of Peiping are doing practical anti-Japanese work. The students of municipal and private elementary and secondary schools are younger and are mostly guided by teachers. This time, the fundraising for anti-Japanese donations is also temporarily assisted by the principals and teachers of various schools. Outsiders suspect that with the tension in Rehe, the students of various universities in Beiping are quiet, and the reporter has specially investigated the reasons for the students' silence in various universities and the anti-Japanese work of Tsinghua and Yenching Universities and the donation situation of elementary and secondary school students, as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e198">Peking University and Normal University are Silent <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>Students at various universities in Peiping,</p>
<p>except for Tsinghua and Yenching</p>
<p>Universities, mostly remain silent. The</p>
<p>reasons are five: (1) Peking University has</p>
<p>been embroiled in a school principal expulsion</p>
<p>storm since last year due to the issue of delaying</p>
<p>tuition fees. As a result, several student</p>
<p>representatives were expelled. Three months ago,</p>
<p>forty-odd male and female students were arrested for holding an anti-Japanese</p>
<p>meeting. Later, the anti-Japanese association of</p>
<p>the school virtually came to a standstill due to</p>
<p>differing opinions among students</p>
<p>regarding the direction of anti-Japanese activities. (2) The reason for</p>
<p>Normal University is that there has been no principal for ten</p>
<p>days. There was once a large principal riot. After</p>
<p>the September 18th Incident, students also</p>
<p>petitioned southward one after another. All student</p>
<p>leaders and central figures in the principal riots</p>
<p>were expelled from school by the principal three</p>
<p>months ago under the order of the Ministry of</p>
<p>Education. Since then, the student union</p>
<p>committee has been scattered and no one is</p>
<p>advising the patriotic movement. (3)</p>
<p>The famous professors welcomed by students at</p>
<p>the University of Technology, Ma Zemin, Hou Wailu, and De Heng,</p>
<p>were arrested on suspicion of being Communists, and</p>
<p>as many as forty-five students were arrested in succession.</p>
<p>The remaining students also stood by indifferently, and even dared</p>
<p>not become leaders of anti-Japanese associations.</p>
<h3 id="e199">Tsinghua Female Students Sew Kits <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>The Tsinghua University Student Union's Anti-</p>
<p>Japanese National Salvation Association received five</p>
<p>thousand emergency first aid kits. The</p>
<p>entire school of female students and professors' wives</p>
<p>began sewing them. They work daily</p>
<p>in the Gongzi Hall.</p>
<p>Each female student and professor's wife sew non-stop,</p>
<p>sewing densely. Among them, someone said,</p>
<p>With the Rehe situation being critical, frontline soldiers</p>
<p>are sacrificing themselves for the country. Women should</p>
<p>do their best to contribute at this time of crisis,</p>
<p>to express their condolences. Also, students from</p>
<p>the school's engineering school, ten</p>
<p>students, organized</p>
<p>a wireless radio association, which facilitates practice,</p>
<p>and once they will apply scientific capabilities to</p>
<p>national defense preparations, for scientific</p>
<p>national salvation. The association has already been established,</p>
<p>electing Jiang Baozeng as president,</p>
<p>Sun Ruiliu as the reporting director,</p>
<p>Zhu Songwei as the machine affairs director,</p>
<p>Bao Xinian as the accounting director,</p>
<p>and Ding Zhengyi as the secretary director.</p>

<p>The steel helmet movement at Yenching University</p>
<p>has become a reality since the student</p>
<p>side ordered one thousand helmets,</p>
<p>and the faculty and staff side has ordered</p>
<p>three thousand nine hundred helmets,</p>
<p>bringing the total, with the student side, to</p>
<p>four thousand nine hundred helmets. The remaining</p>
<p>purchasing method is either by donation,</p>
<p>or by order. As for the first batch</p>
<p>of one thousand steel helmets ordered,</p>
<p>they will be completed and in stock within a week.</p>
<p>It is heard that the goal of the school</p>
<p>is to raise enough to purchase ten thousand steel</p>
<p>helmets. The anti-Japanese association has</p>
<p>decided on six principles for distributing steel</p>
<p>helmets: (1) Troops currently fighting against</p>
<p>Japan; (2) Armies previously organized with discipline;</p>
<p>(3) Armies capable of fighting;</p>
<p>(4) Armies currently in critical war zones;</p>
<p>(5) Personally delivered to the front by the student</p>
<p>anti-Japanese association; (6) Carefully and evenly distributed.</p>

<p>Liu Facheng, a worker at Yenching University, deeply concerned about the lack of food supplies at the front lines and the difficulties in transportation, and moved by the sight of soldiers fighting on empty stomachs, has voluntarily initiated a "Big Pancake Movement."  These pancakes are "as big as a wok, about one foot in diameter and three inches thick, each weighing about ten catties and costing about seventy cents."  He appeals to the public to emulate this donation and send them to the front lines for the soldiers to eat. Mr. Liu has a large pancake, the Yenching University Student Anti-Japanese Association has one, and he requests that donations be quickly initiated. The association will hang the pancake high, display it downstairs in the building, and set up a donation box, asking students to donate freely. It is planned to move it to other places for display in the coming days to solicit donations from all sides. From 4:00 PM to 5:00 PM every day, responsible staff members Tan Haiying and Zhang Desheng will be in charge of receiving donations at the Anti-Japanese Association office, so that this glorious and majestic classroom will have one more large pancake on display.</p>

<p>Students from public and private primary and secondary schools in Beiping have eagerly and voluntarily raised funds since receiving donor registration books from the Education Association, achieving remarkable results.  The amount of donations is highest from Pei-Man Girls' High School, as it is a school with many aristocratic young ladies. The donations from faculty and staff of municipal primary and secondary schools are deducted from their salaries by the Social Affairs Bureau and submitted to the Donations United Association for delivery to the Education Association.  The student donations alone total 2,188 yuan, 7 jiao, and 2 fen.</p>

<p>The Municipal Education Bureau yesterday issued an order to all primary and secondary schools in the city, stating that sanitation and physical education are essential for the strength of young children’s bodies and the health of their minds.  Schools should pay close attention to them and implement them diligently, as previously ordered. However, having adequate sanitation and sports facilities will greatly facilitate implementation.  Schools should add as many of these as possible within the possible range of operating expenses to facilitate teaching and learning. This order is hereby issued for compliance.</p>
<h3 id="e204">Military Song (Three) by Luo Jialun <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>(Dedicated to the Anti-Japanese People of the Northeast)</p>
<p>China's three northeastern provinces,</p>
<p>Have the most fertile land.</p>
<p>Black earth is black,</p>
<p>Sorghum is tall,</p>
<p>The north wind rises and the horse herds are proud.</p>
<p>Changbai Mountain is covered in white snow,</p>
<p>The Yalu River surges and roars.</p>
<p>Our ancestors toiled diligently to develop this land.</p>
<p>Who dares to invade and occupy it?</p>
<p>Let him first try my blade.</p>
<p>If a man is born without courage to kill the enemy,</p>
<p>Even in death, he cannot be considered a hero!</p>
<p>At this time when the national war for survival has begun, there should be inspiring and passionate military songs to strengthen the morale of the army and encourage the spirit of the people. However, what has been heard in recent years has mostly been decadent music, which causes me deep concern. Therefore, I have written several military songs. Mr. Tang Xueyong, a music expert, saw them and praised them, promising to compose music for them. Thus, I, despite my humble talents, present them to the world. The inadequacy of the lyrics is truly due to the surging national consciousness that I cannot restrain myself. The music for the first song has already been composed and will be printed after correction. The music for the second and third songs is being prepared and will also be printed soon. Because many people have written to Mr. Tang requesting the sheet music, it is planned to print these three songs together with the lyrics into a small booklet for distribution. Those who need it can write directly to the Publishing Group of Nanjing Central University to request it. Domestic writers should feel the same at this time of deep crisis and urgent disaster. If we can use this opportunity to cultivate a magnificent and powerful literary sound to express the great spirit of the Chinese nation, this is truly what I sincerely pray for. My humble work is insignificant. Luo Jialun respectfully notes.</p>

<p>Jiangwan Xinmin Middle School used to be very developed and was one of the best-run private schools in Shanghai. During the January 28th Incident last year, the school moved to the concession to hold classes. All the equipment and books in the Jiangwan school were looted, and part of the school building was destroyed, resulting in a huge loss. Last autumn, the school moved back to the Jiangwan site to hold classes, but many students hesitated to come because they listened to rumors, so the number of students was not large. Now, after more than half a year of rectification, the school has gradually returned to its former glory, and the number of students has increased to more than 200. In order to actively expand, the school has scheduled a board meeting around the 20th of this month to discuss everything.

<p>Today at 5:30 PM</p>

<p>The Western League Football Association will hold a referee meeting today at 5:30 PM in the hall of the Royal Asiatic Society at No. 6, Museum Road. All referees are expected to attend.</p>
<h3 id="e222">Tonight's Second Act of the Wan Guo Basketball Tournament: Both Chinese Men's and Women's Teams to Appear <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>6:30 PM: China vs. League (Women)</p>
<p>7:30 PM: China vs. Korea (Men)</p>
<p>8:30 PM: America vs. Jewish (Men)</p>
<p>Tonight is the second act of the Wan Guo Basketball Tournament, starting at 6:30 PM at the Chinese Basketball Hall on Route Father Laoshen. The Chinese men's and women's teams will perform in two important games. The American men's team will also make their first appearance tonight. The situations of the three games are described below:</p>
<p>(1) China vs. League (Women), 6:30 PM, Referee: Huo Er</p>
<p>(2) China vs. Korea (Men), 7:30 PM, Referee: Wu Jiatang</p>
<p>(3) America vs. Japan (Men), 8:30 PM, Referee: Li Zuqi</p>
<p>...In the first women's game, the League team showed its brilliance in the battle with the British team a few days ago. Although they lost, their skills were praised by knowledgeable people. As for the Chinese team, their victory over the United States last time can be said to be a successful work. Today, facing the League team, if they can maintain their previous prestige, they may be able to win again. The strength of both sides can be said to be average, and there will be a fierce battle at that time.</p>
<p>...In the second game, China's men's team faces Korea. China has been the owner of the championship for many years, and Korea has never been known, so it is far from being China's enemy. It is hoped that the Chinese team will make a good rehearsal in preparation for dealing with the United States.</p>
<p>...The finale is the American team, which has won the championship for two consecutive years, against the Jewish team. The American team is based on the Xiqing team, the champion of the upper group, with Mai Ling as a fresh force. Its strength is beyond imagination. The Jewish team is the champion of the B Division of the Shanghai Basketball Association. Although their skills are considerable, they are not the opponents of the United States. However, how the American team performs is worthy of our attention, because this can give us a glimpse of the situation in the Sino-American finals in the future.</p>

<p>The Nanxing Basketball Team of Jiaotong University sent a letter inviting the Eagles team to a friendly game at the school's gymnasium. In the first half, the Eagles team was unfamiliar with the terrain, so Nanxing took the lead by three points, the score being 19 to 16. In the afternoon, under the leadership of Kong Guangyi, Lin Zequn and others, the Eagles team made repeated efforts to counterattack, and finally won with a score of 38 to 29.

<p>The Yueqing Basketball Team has made even more progress since returning to Shanghai from its expedition to the Soviet Union. Last Saturday, it met Qingzhong by appointment at the school's gymnasium at Fanwangdu. Qingzhong had won the championship of the Zizi Group of this year's China Youth Basketball League, and Yueqing had only lost to Qingzhong once, ranking second. Therefore, the battle the day before yesterday was nothing short of a dragon-tiger fight. As a result, Yueqing won against Qingzhong with a score of 35 to 29. In terms of skills, both sides are in good condition. One is good at short passes, and the other has flexible forwards. Qingzhong lost to Yueqing, could it be that they were unfamiliar with the field? In the first half, Yueqing scored 14 points, and Qingzhong scored 15 points.</p>

<h3 id="e227">American Basketball Expert Talks About the Situation of Basketball Spreading to Countries Around the World <a href="#e227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>Twenty Million People Around the World Play Basketball for Men and Women</p>
<p>America Will Send a Team to Perform at the Next Olympic Games</p>
<p>(Lawrence, USA, 6th) American basketball expert Forrest C. Allen, Chairman of the American National Basketball Coaches Association and member of the Olympic Committee, talked about the benefits of basketball competition and the situation around the world. According to statistics, the number of men and women in the public who play basketball today has reached 20 million, and almost every country is actively promoting this competition.</p>
<h3 id="e228">Countries Where Basketball Has Spread <a href="#e228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>The countries where basketball competition has become popular are France, Italy, China, Japan, Persia, India, Sweden, the Philippines, Portugal, Czechoslovakia, Turkey, Greece, Mexico, Canada, Poland, Russia, Germany, Britain, and various countries in South America, all of which have basketball competition.</p>
<h3 id="e229">The Process of Spreading to Europe <a href="#e229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>The International YMCA has of course spread this competition from the Americas to various countries for a long time, and after the European War, the American Army's teaching of basketball in Europe was a major reason for popularizing it in Europe. In 1900, the American Army taught basketball to the Philippines. In 1918, after the European War, the American Army that occupied Germany taught basketball to the Germans. In 1919, the American, French, and Italian Allies held a triangular championship in Paris. The United States won easily. After the signing of the peace treaty, the two American teams, at the invitation of the British government, performed in the British zone of the war zone. The British were happy to learn it.</p>
<h3 id="e230">The Olympic Games Did Not Adopt It <a href="#e230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>Almost all countries in the world use the American basketball rules as the standard, because the United States is the mother country of basketball, so they all follow it. At the Olympic Games held in Los Angeles last autumn, Allen proposed to the committee to use basketball competition as a performance. All countries expressed their support and interest, but the Americans did not pay attention to it and support it. As a result, the committee, due to economic income, changed to using American football as a performance. People in various countries knew less about it and paid less attention to it.</p>
<h3 id="e231">International Interest Is Growing <a href="#e231" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c231" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">231</a></h3>
<p>With the widespread adoption of basketball competition, it is likely to be adopted at the Olympic Games to be held in Berlin in 1936. The recent visit of the Mexican team and the Meiji University basketball team of Japan to the United States proves that international interest is growing. Both teams were warmly welcomed and successful in the United States. According to a letter to Allen from the coach of Waseda University in Japan, if there had been basketball at the Olympic Games last autumn, Japan would have sent participants. A common opinion is that at the next Olympic Games, the United States should select two teams to perform once, because the subtle techniques of the United States in this field are truly beyond the reach of other countries.</p>
<h3 id="e232">Enthusiastic Participation in Heated Pool Swimming <a href="#e232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>Shi Xinglong Appointed as Full-Time Instructor</p>
<p>Since the Chinese Swimming Research Association established a heated swimming pool within the Huang Ke Gymnasium on Seymour Road and began recruiting members, over 300 people have already registered. However, many have not yet completed all the procedures. To conclude the recruitment and complete the process as soon as possible, we urge all those interested to complete the procedures promptly. Otherwise, once the quota of 300 is filled, no exceptions will be made. Furthermore, regarding member Yu Binqi's request to hire a dedicated instructor, he traveled to Beijing the day before yesterday to discuss the matter of instruction with Mr. Shi Xinglong, a national swimming champion. After discussions, Mr. Shi was very willing to take on the role. Ladies in this city who wish to join the association can still register at the association's office on the third floor of the China Industrial Company at No. 9, Sanma Road.

<p>Unprecedented Plunge in the Gold Market</p>
<p>The United States Will Abandon the Gold Standard, Prohibiting Cash Exports</p>
<p>The Market Suddenly Lost Its Normal State, and People Fell into Absolute Terror</p>
<p>The Opening Plunge Was Forty-Nine Taels and Seven Mace, at 698 Taels</p>
<p>The Lowest Point Reached 660 Taels, Showing Long-Distance Fluctuations</p>
<p>Falling Madly by Sixty-Six Taels and Seven Mace at a Difference of Forty-Three Taels</p>
<p>Recently, the gold market has been favorable to short sellers, but it seemed that there was a need to hover for a while. Who would have known that after Roosevelt took office as president, the financial turmoil suddenly expanded? The call to abolish the gold standard became even louder, and countries stopped all dealings with US exchange rates, fearing unexpected drastic changes. People were in a state of absolute panic. The Gold Exchange originally planned to open after the HSBC US exchange rate was posted, so it was delayed until after 9:30. When HSBC's posting was revealed, the telegraphic transfer rate remained unchanged, but the US exchange rate had no price. The Gold Exchange suddenly opened, and the calling prices were chaotic, at 698 taels, already breaking through the 700 taels mark, plunging more than 40 taels. However, people's panic had reached its peak, and sellers were still numerous. The decline was rapid, and in an instant, it plunged 38 taels, sharply dropping to 660 taels. Afterwards, because there were still many short covering, it rose by ten, but there were occasional long-distance fluctuations. The US exchange rate saw transactions at this point, and it was bound to be much looser than the previous close, and there was no time to consider it. Telegraphic transfer rates in the market were also good, and there were quite a few people covering shorts at low prices in the market. However, large long positions such as Hengxing and Fuchang remained silent because they did not acknowledge the opening price. Buyers were hit hard, and the gold price once rebounded more than 40 taels, reaching 703 taels. However, the market price changed extremely quickly, with large ups and downs. Banks' appetite was not good, all hoarding US dollars, and the trend was still downward. Furthermore, because Reuters reported that US officials had formally announced the abolition of the gold standard, it fell further to 695 taels. The noon close was 682.5 taels. The afternoon opening saw a horizontal plunge, to 676 taels, and then to 84 taels. The United States formally announced a ban on the export of gold and silver, and it fell to 70 taels, but there was still an eight-tael rebound. The exchange rate was still strong, falling to 64 taels, and then leveling off. In reality, short sellers took advantage of the low price to maintain their positions, so it was pulled up. It was extended to the close at 681 taels. Looking at the trend throughout the day, although it plunged, it was not excessive, because large long positions had disputes and did not take action, and there were very few short covering, which maintained the price. Among them, because the news was not good, there were many declines. As for the spot future business, there was no time to mention it, so there were few transactions, only calculated at 13 taels added to the price, with a discount of more than ten taels. The market situation during the day is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The morning opening was extremely chaotic, at 698 taels, lower than the previous Saturday's opening by 47.9 taels. Sellers were more numerous than buyers, and this price was extremely difficult to obtain, with only a few transactions by Futaiheng and Dadecheng. The price of goods opened at 680 taels, a huge difference of 18 taels. Short covering of goods was sold off, and Zhifeng, Yongheng, and Yushunli all came to sell. In an instant, it plummeted more than 30, like a river rushing straight down, sharply dropping to 660 taels. Dadecheng and Wanxing advanced to 15 taels. Retail investors sold in large quantities, and it went to 80 taels. Hongxing, Qianchangxiang bought again, to 90 taels. Bingxing and Dadecheng bravely bought in, and sharply broke through from 88 taels to 702 taels. Bingxing suddenly came to sell, and it fell back to 692 taels. Yuanmao and Yongjin bought again outside 700 taels, but there was a degree of turbulence. Yuanmao, Yongqingfa, and Yong continued to buy in, and it continued to rise, reaching 703 taels. Zhifeng Yong came to sell, and news of a plug on the June US dollar at 33 yuan was spread, and it fell to within 690 taels. Foreign telegrams said that the United States had formally abandoned the gold standard, and a decline occurred. Zhifeng Yong, Daxing Yong, Yuanmao Yong all sold their positions and fell to within 80 taels, to 78 taels. However, because of the rush to cover shorts, the market price was erratic, rising five or six taels in an instant, to 84 taels. However, because supply exceeded demand, another wave arose. Large accounts such as Fuyu and Yuankangxiang continued to sell, and broke 80 taels. Ruixing also came to sell, and it fell further to 75 taels. Chunyuan Yong and Qianchangxiang bought at low prices, and it was pulled to outside 80 taels. Daxing Yong and Wanxing also entered, reaching 86 taels. The exchange rate continued to be strong, and banks' appetite was inclined to hoard, but there was a lack of opponents. At this time, Zhongfu plugged the May US dollar at 32.5 yuan, and Huabi also offered the June dollar at 34 yuan, all of which were accepted by the Dalian gang, while Shunli came to offer, and Fuyu also sold, falling to 80 taels. However, because the exchange rate was high, banks tended to accept it. Zhongfu later picked up the April US dollar at 33.625 yuan, and rose to 84. Yuanmao Yong, Wanxing, and Fuyu all sold, and although it fell to within 80 taels, to 78 taels, the confidence was still good, and there were still many buyers, and the trend seemed flat. Retail investors and goods all bought, and gradually rose. Western merchant Xiang Meng had picked up the April US dollar at 33.5 yuan, and it rose further to 84 taels. Before long, the noon close was 682.5 taels, and goods were auctioned at 83 taels at the close. Demand seemed to be high, and it was once as good as five taels.</p>
<p>The afternoon opening suddenly fell to 676, with goods opening at 83, with the greatest possible changes. Market prices rose and fell, uncertain. After the opening, demand suddenly surged, and retail investors pushed up the price from the middle. In an instant, it broke through to outside 80 taels. Goods even surged, reaching 84 taels. Reuters sent a telegram that the United States had formally announced that it would stop the export of gold and silver altogether, and that the method for overseas accounts would be resolved on Thursday. For a time, waves were surging, and sellers were extremely excited. It had to plummet another 14 taels, dropping to 670 taels. Qianchangxiang came to enter, a good eight taels, to 78. Pan Gen offered the June US dollar at 35 yuan, and Fuyu and Dadecheng came to sell, falling to 73 taels. Daxing Yongzhao Fengchang slightly entered and saw a return. Fuyu sold again and Zhongfu also plugged the May US dollar at 34.5 yuan, and then it retreated to within 70 taels, to 9 taels. It was difficult to obtain. By the time it was available, Yuanmao Yong came to offer, and retail investors, who were originally mostly long, began to raise prices, quoting 75 taels. Retail investors saw a profit and exited, and with the exchange rate trending strong, the June rate of 35 yuan and the current month rate of 33.5 yuan all had sellers. Qingfayong came to sell, and Zhifengyong also sold, retreating to 70. Qianchangxiang then entered, and because Fushun sold positions, it began to hover. Yuan Daxingda all sold, but Yifeng Yong suddenly entered strongly, rising to four taels. Runchang Yu slightly exited, and Fuyu's selling interest was unabated, selling to 70 taels. Shanghai sold the current month's US dollars to the four banks at 34 yuan. Hengyu Deng Yuan Yong also sold. For a time, buyers lacked strength, and the decline began again, with no one knowing the reason. Zhongfu offered the June US dollar at 35 yuan, and Qianchangxiang also came to sell positions, and it fell to 64 taels, probably because the June US exchange rate of 35 yuan was not asked about. The news that the United States decided to abolish the gold standard within two days was only released in the market at this time, but because the price of gold had fallen, it rose again. Chunyuan Yong came and it was good at eight and a half taels, and shortly thereafter it retreated, by three taels plus, the June US dollar 25 yuan 25 HSBC picked up. Yuankangxiang Fuyu came to buy, exiting at 70 taels, to 72 taels. However, because Qingfayong dumped, it still fell back to 67 taels. Fushun Dade, Fuyu came to accept, and then to 70 taels, and suddenly jumped up, such as Huabi picking up the April US dollar at 34.375 yuan, and it was very good to 80 taels. However, because of the relationship between Holland and Citibank doing the June rate at 34.5 yuan, people's hearts were still empty. Zhifeng Yong sold first, and Chunyuan Yong also saw a high price and came to sell, and it plunged eight taels, to 72 taels. Hengchang Yong suddenly entered frantically, and Yuanmao Yong also accepted it, at around 78 taels. Furthermore, because Qianchangxiang Yifeng Yong entered, it reached 80 taels. Yuanmao Yong entered again and the closing price was 681 taels. Goods were sold at the same price. The highest price for the day was 703 taels, and the lowest price was 660 taels, a difference of 43 taels. As a result, it fell sharply by 66 taels and seven mace compared to the previous Saturday.</p>
<p>The quoted price had no standard because the HSBC US dollar was not on the market. It is said that some used customs gold, and others used the London gold pound price, but neither was formally determined. The current month's accounting was 686 taels, April 683 taels, morning make-up water 686 taels, afternoon 684 taels.</p>
<p>The market was extremely chaotic. It is estimated that Zhifengyong Nei Xing Ruixing Heng Yu Lifu Fushun You Yuan Yong and others sold, and Dadecheng Hongxing Qianchangxiang Yifeng Yong Hengchang Yong Yuankangxiang Yuanmao Yong Yichang and others bought. The Dalian gang sold as soon as Shunli opened, and there were not many entries and exits afterward. Wanxing entered first and then exited. The Cantonese gang did not take action. In the market, those who were dissatisfied with the Gold Exchange opening (because there was no US dollar standard), such as Hengxing, Fuchang, and Jiuheng, did not take action. As of the 4th, the amount of April positions totaled 25,228.</p>
<p>In March, Rende Cheng redeemed 49 public contracts, Yingfeng Heng 70, Qianchangxiang 56, Yong and others 7. Runchang Yu collected 63, Runchang Yong 49, Hengxing 15, Tongfeng Heng 14, Renshun 14, Dafeng Heng 7, for a total of 182.</p>
<p>The spot situation was not good. Because the future trend was extremely bad, there was no interest in buying or selling. It is known that the price was only 13 taels. Previously, because the situation in the United States was chaotic, the customer group was willing to sell their inventory. The Tianjin group was even more anxious, and asked for buyers everywhere, and were willing to sell at a reduced price. More cash shops collected them, totaling more than a thousand taels.</p>
<p>Due to the sharp decline in future markets, colleagues were overwhelmed and had no time to pay attention, so there were few transactions. Only Yingfeng Heng once gave Dadecheng 70 (1-4 months), priced at 15 taels, which was unexpected. As of the 4th, 1,519 March positions remained.</p>
<p>The Gold Exchange had two announcements yesterday: (1) Due to the very abnormal fluctuations in the US exchange rate, the opening of the market will be temporarily delayed until the HSBC US exchange rate is announced, and then the market will open as usual. (2) From today onwards, in addition to closing transactions, a special margin of 35 yuan will be charged for new buying and selling positions, bringing the total margin to 75 yuan.</p>
<p>Most long positions believed that, according to the first announcement, the market should not be opened to avoid losses for both parties, or to wait until the special margin was collected before trading. Therefore, there was a tendency to disapprove of today's market price, resulting in refusal to pay the difference. As a result, the market was uneasy, even more than panicked.</p>
<h3 id="e233">Exchange Market: Sterling Tight, US Dollar Loose <a href="#e233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>New York Telegraphic Transfer and Silver Market Suspended, the Situation at the Port Was Unusually Chaotic</p>
<p>US Dollar Exchange Rate Not Quoted, Private Transactions Down More Than 39</p>
<p>According to foreign dispatches yesterday, London telegraphic transfer near and far were at 0.0625. The New York silver price was suspended. British exchange rate to US exchange rate did not even happen. The intensity of the financial turmoil in the United States can be imagined. Therefore, the opening of the local exchange market yesterday morning priced near sterling exchange rate, and US dollar exchange rate there was no price because the gold market had not opened. HSBC whether to have a price or not, was not yet certain, and people were unusually chaotic. It was only after the HSBC quotation was revealed that the sterling exchange rate did not move, but the US dollar exchange rate was not quoted. The gold market traded after a long time when it first opened, but the transfers out were extremely chaotic, without a certain standard. Foreign exchange companies had settlements. Banks poured out their strength to sell. Dalian Gang in the gold industry took over. In the afternoon, banks were doing more interbank business. Mitsui HSBC Sassoon all picked up sterling exchange rate. Holland Zhejiang then sold. Zhongfu sold. Xiangjin Dongyang Lines solicited buys. Other businesses had some appetites, without much with the other businesses.

<p>Yesterday the market was with the extending period of the current specified standard price, and was still not yet balanced with the silver dollar adjustments.

Thus, the market was slow, the transaction turned to be less, and the market price did not rise or fall.</p>

<p>Securities Debt Market Storm Was Intense</p>
<p>The Result Was Still Flat, Each Bond Only Fell by Three to Four Jiao</p>
<p>Total Transactions Were 10,047,700 Yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday, a major change occurred in the situation of bonds on the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange. The loss of Chengde in Rehe and the increasingly serious situation in North China, coupled with the intensifying financial turmoil in the United States, caused the margin market in this port to be almost impossible to bid on, with private trading falling by more than 100 taels. The public debt market was also shocked, with the northern help selling No. 20 and No. 47 as soon as the market opened, and retail investors following suit. Although No. 11 and No. 38 and others still had a good appetite, the forces were too far apart, and the market price fell uniformly by about one yuan. The second round was still depressed, but at the same time, a certain giant account absorbed quite a bit, so the continued drop was only three or four jiao. The 19 Customs and salt tax futures even raised one jiao, and people's hearts suddenly became dazed. In the afternoon, the situation changed abruptly, and although many of No. 2 and No. 47 were sold, the market price could not be lowered. The market prices of each bond increased by several jiao. The 20 Customs even rose by one yuan, and the closing price of demobilization rose by nine jiao. The market price reversed so quickly, or it was said that because of the change in Rehe, it was feared that a drastic change would occur in the market, and a certain official maintained it from the middle. Speculators used the previous situation as a warning from the past, so the change of wind was also extremely fast, so there was an image of rabbits rising and falcons falling. At the moment, the most important thing is to hope that North China does not get caught in the whirlpool, otherwise the future of the market price is unimaginable. The result of yesterday's market price was still flat, with only a drop of three or four jiao, and demobilization only fell by five jiao, and reorganization rose by five fen. The total transaction volume was relatively large, totaling 10,047,400 yuan, of which spot trading accounted for four types, totaling 14,000 yuan, and futures salt tax made 1.57 million, and demobilization and unified tax each made 2.07 million, and the rest only made tens of thousands.</p>
<p>Yarn, Raw Cotton and Cotton Yarn</p>
<p>The Process Is Complex</p>
<p>The Morning Market Suffered From the Impact of Gold Waves and Fell</p>
<p>The Afternoon Market Rose With the Stimulation of US Telegrams</p>
<p>The yarn market situation is extremely chaotic. Because there are many rumors, people's hearts are not stable. In the morning, the price of gold plummeted, and the cotton market was unstable. The yarn market fell accordingly. In the afternoon, it was heard that the Tianjin Gang bought three or four thousand pieces of inferior yarn, and the price also rose by about two or two taels. There were many statements that the United States would abandon the gold standard, and prices would rise. Therefore, the buying trend rose suddenly, but the actual needs were still quiet. At present, in this gold wave, the yarn and cotton market conditions are increasingly lacking in grasp.</p>

<p>The Man-Made Textile market opened this morning, and the people in the market were panicked. The price of gold fell by sixty taels, and most retailers panicked. Each month fell five, six, and seven qian. The market opened flat in the afternoon. The second and third rounds suddenly rose. It was rumored that raw cotton was expected to rise sharply, and buyers increased. Each month rose seven, eight, and nine qian. The total transaction volume was 35,600 packages. It was found that Dafu sold 1,700 packages, Yukang 1,200 packages, Gengfeng 1,000 packages, and Yichang 2,250 packages. Gengfeng bought 850 packages, Tongfu 900 packages, total decline of 1,500 packages, Dacian owed 1,250 packages, Senkang 600 packages, and Dachangcheng 1,400 packages, Chunji 600 packages, Hengchang 650 packages.

<p>The liquidation of existing yarn remains sluggish. It was found that all gangs bought a total of 410 packages throughout the day. Prices fell by five qian to one or two taels in the morning, and rose by five qian in the afternoon. The amount bought by each gang is as follows:</p>
<p>Nanjing 10 Wuhu 49 Mainland 180 Changsha 10 Peers 15 Datong 5</p>
<p>Guangdong 30 Shantou 58 Ningbo 23 Fujian 5 Luzhou 21</p>
<p>The cotton market initially fell and then rose, with a complicated trend. The US government banned the export of gold and silver due to financial panic. The abandonment of the gold standard may be realized, and the US exchange rate will undergo major changes, and the price of cotton will also be significantly affected. Therefore, people were panicked for a time, and selling increased. Unexpectedly, it suddenly rose in the afternoon. There were many statements that US prices were expected to rise sharply, and that US cotton was expected to rise sharply. Therefore, the platform suddenly tightened, and buyers crowded, so the market rose. However, it is difficult to grasp in this chaotic state. The US cotton market will be held on Thursday.</p>

<p>At the beginning of last week, the market was firm due to rain in Gokak and Broach, but later weakened as the damage was not severe. The cotton market trended weakly due to unfavorable overseas news and selling by European and Japanese shippers. Cotton inventories were higher than the same period last year, but frequent low prices hindered arrivals. Currently, although major buyers are scarce, offerings are also small. Export inquiries are insignificant. Factories are making great efforts to reduce production. The weekly statistics are appended below (in units of 1,000 bales):</p>

<p>Grains: Rice Market Sales Stagnant and Further Weak</p>
<p>(South Shanghai) Due to the boatmen's strike which has lasted for ten days, even with the authorities' mediation, the issue of the funnel (漏斗) versus the peck (斛) has not been resolved, resulting in no new supply. Consumption remains normal, so the market has not been affected by the shortage of goods, but has instead become sluggish. Asking prices continue to fall, with varying amounts. Only the goods in godowns and small accumulated goods from Puxi are being transacted.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, No. 23 steady rice (穩二三號) arrived from Xiaogang in the lower reaches of the river. Sales of white glutinous rice were sluggish, leading to a further market weakening. Sales of thin glutinous early rice were scarce, with prices down 20 cents. Dujian rice was down a small amount, while Buke rice was stable. Yangjian rice showed a slightly softening trend. Yinyuan and Baiyuan rice prices weakened by almost 10 cents.</p>
<h3 id="e245">Fujian Merchants Enthusiastically Purchase Hunan-Jiangxi Late Indica Rice <a href="#e245" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c245" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">245</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the situation in the late indica rice market turned active. High-quality goods were tight, while mid-grade and lower-quality goods were stable. This was because purchases from local firms had not stopped recently. However, purchases varied in quantity, with activity fluctuating between local and out-of-town merchants. When local firms were active, out-of-town merchants observed; when out-of-town purchases were strong, local sales were weak. This up-and-down pattern only allowed the market to maintain a balanced level. Yesterday, purchases by local firms were not strong, but a small amount of trial purchases by inland firms suddenly occurred, and Fujian merchants enthusiastically made purchases, with total transactions reaching over 5,000 bags. The market also turned surprisingly brisk. However, continuous arrivals of various Hunan and Jiangxi indica rice types meant that only high-quality goods were slightly tighter, while mid-grade and lower-quality goods remained stable and soft. Throughout the day, over 2,000 bags of Jiangxi machine-milled late rice were sold, priced from $8.64 to $8.23. Also, 100 bags of machine-milled early rice were sold at $7.55. Hunan machine-milled oil rice was priced from $8.40 to $8.23. Also, 100 bags of white unpolished rice were sold at $7.15, and 120 bags of early unpolished rice were sold at $6.75. Among these, 100 bags of machine-milled early rice were for trial purchases by inland firms. Local firms only purchased over 500 bags each of machine-milled late rice and machine-milled red rice. The remainder was purchased by Fujian merchants.</p>

<p>| Price Differences Among Different Months Vary Greatly |</p>

<p>After trading began yesterday morning, the market for each month showed an initial rise followed by a decline. The quotation for foreign wheat, particularly Canadian wheat, rose by 50 cents, which caused people's sentiment to become briefly firm, with prices increasing by approximately 5 cents. However, in subsequent trading sessions, the market gradually weakened due to a rare drop in the gold market, which was expected to lead to a significant increase in exchange rates. Additionally, some factories followed the trend and sold off holdings, causing prices for various months to fall again, from 1.5 to 2 cents. When trading began in the afternoon, market sentiment was initially flat, but later improved because, although there were no large-scale disposals of spot goods, sales were very brisk. Therefore, various merchants opened higher prices, showing signs of improvement. Given the current situation, if there are no problems at sea, and with the sharp fall in the gold market and the rise in exchange rates, there is concern that sellers of foreign wheat will come in an endless stream. This also requires attention. As a result, the current month was 5 li better than the previous week, April remained unchanged, May was 5 li better, June and July were slightly better by 2.5 li, and August was slightly better by 5 li.</p>
<h3 id="e248">Wheat Market <a href="#e248" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c248" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">248</a></h3>
<p>When trading began in the morning, the market for each month showed signs of improvement. The near-term price of Canadian wheat rose by 50 cents, and due to the severity of the international situation, people's sentiment became optimistic. Prices for each month opened 2, 3, or 4 cents higher than the previous day. However, when trading began in the afternoon, near-term sentiment weakened again because the flour market had risen and then fallen in the morning, and the gold market had sharply declined while the exchange rate had risen. People inevitably became concerned. March and April fell back by 2 to 4 cents, but longer-dated months saw continued buying interest as selling interest was low, leading to a trend of market expansion. As a result, the current month remained unchanged, April fell slightly by 1 cent, July rose by 2 cents, and August rose by 4 cents.</p>

<p>Fearing Supply Disruptions... Uniform Optimism</p>
<p>Having been in a depressed state for a long time, the oilseed cake market yesterday saw uniform optimism due to concerns about supply disruptions. Soybean sentiment was poor, so the situation was relatively stable. However, the oil market rose rapidly, causing anxious buying in the market, with over 2,000 pieces transacted at a price increase of 3-4 mace. Soybean cake prices had been aggressively suppressed by the factories, but the market yesterday encountered both positive sentiment and strong sales, causing it to improve by 3-4 cents. Sales were strongest to the Xinghua merchants, followed by merchants from Wenzhou, Taizhou, and inland regions, with total transactions reaching an estimated 15-16,000 pieces. If sales to out-of-town merchants can continue, the market will not necessarily weaken again.</p>
<p>Sugar Market: 1,800 Tons of Futures Coarse White Sugar Traded</p>
<p>Anticipating Lower Exchange Rate Combined Prices</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market was very weak due to a sharp fall in benchmark gold. The guild set the price of ordinary grade No. 24 coarse granulated white sugar at 15 taels and 3 mace, but there were no transactions. High-grade RA mark Zhaga was priced at 15 taels, 5 mace, and 7.5 fen, a drop of 2.5 fen from the previous day. Over 100 bags of Dutch Red No. 8 were transacted at a price of 10 taels and 8.5 mace, down 5 fen from the previous day. Chang Yu offered 1,000 bags of spot Dutch red sugar at a price of 4.075 Dutch guilders, plus tax. Futures No. 24 coarse granulated white sugar was traded at 1,800 tons, because the firms believed that the future exchange rate combined price would be low. Dachang offered 200 tons for April delivery at a price of 4.2 Dutch guilders, and 500 tons for June/July delivery. Shunquanlong offered 400 tons at 4.325 Dutch guilders. Liji offered 300 tons for May/June delivery, and Shuixing offered 200 tons at 4.3 Dutch guilders. Changxing also offered 200 tons of road cargo at 4.325 Dutch guilders.</p>
<p>North-South Goods: Longan and Dried Lychee Offering Prices Continue to Rise</p>
<p>(Dried Longan) The various firms have recently been actively selling dried longan. Yesterday, over 300 pieces were offered at a price of 26 taels. (Jinshan Dried Lychee) Several hundred more pieces of Jinshan dried lychee were offered yesterday. Because the firms' buying interest was very high, prices rose by another 1-2 taels, and the market price also tightened accordingly. (Dried Cinnamon) Over 200 more boxes were offered yesterday. Due to the small quantity, prices remained firm, with the asking price rising by another 2 taels.</p>
<p>Silk and Tea: American Bank Turmoil</p>
<p>New York Silk Telegrams Not Transmitted</p>
<p>Lyon's Actual Sales Sluggish... Silk Sales Almost Come to a Halt</p>
<p>Yesterday, the silk market for foreign firms in Shanghai almost came to a standstill because the American banking turmoil spread widely, the New York commercial market was sluggish, and silk telegrams were not transmitted. Lyon's actual sales were becoming increasingly sluggish. Chinese silk merchants were also very passive. Yesterday morning, none of the foreign firms conducted negotiations. Only in the afternoon did Xiangli buy eight bales of middle-grade head-of-nest yellow coarse silk at a price of 305 taels.</p>

<p>Hangzhou merchants' purchased white factory silk in Shanghai is being shipped in batches due to the urgent need for weaving spring silk.

<p>Yesterday, some Morocco-bound telegram inquiries were received for Zhenmei and Zhenmei Needle green tea produced by local tea factories. British firms such as Quejiang, Xiehe, and Tongfu purchased small amounts. The entire city transacted over 240 boxes, but Zhenmei opened at an offering price as low as 28 taels, down another 3-4 mace from last week. The main reason is that drastic changes have occurred in overseas finance, and the impact of hot wars has made people eager to sell off their holdings. The tea market trend is still one of decline with no rises.</p>

<p>Spring Chills, Thin Woolen Fabric Sales Turn Stagnant</p>
<p>The arrival of winter-like cold in spring has greatly impacted the business of woolen fabric stores. The spring and thin fabrics purchased previously have experienced a sudden slowdown in sales. Sales on the street are not as brisk as ten weeks ago. Among out-of-town merchants, only inland merchants continue to have demand. North-bound merchants from Tianjin and Hebei have no inquiries. Previous occasional small purchases, except for those sent out by parcel post at the time, are being unilaterally notified to return the new goods that have not been sent out, because the tense situation has caused most to reduce their scope to avoid losses.</p>

The quality is dry and pure, and it dissolves without residue. It is the highest-grade domestically produced white sugar. We have not seen this grade of goods for over a dozen years. It is said that sugar production will increase in the future and may reappear. "Packaging Method": Packaged in baskets, covered with cloth bags and tied, or in double burlap bags.</p>
<p>"Quanzhou White" is produced in Quanzhou, Fujian. The color is slightly inferior to "Tribute Powder," and the quality and aroma are also lower. However, the sweetness is similar. (Packaging Method) Double burlap wrapped and tied.</p>
<p>"Xinghua White" is produced in Xinghua Prefecture, Fujian. The color is like Quanzhou White, but the quality is coarser and the sweetness is adequate. (Method of Use) Same as above.</p>
<p>"Zuojiang White" is produced in Zuojiang, Guangxi. The color is as white as TaiKoo's Three-Temperature-and-a-Half Sugar, the texture is fine and clean, and it also has aroma and adequate sweetness. (Packaging Method) Same as above.</p>
<p>"Yangli White" is produced in Yangli, Guangxi. What is now called Nali White is this type. The color is similar to Zuojiang White, with slight variations. The sweetness is adequate, but the aroma is less. (Packaging Method) Same as above.</p>
<p>"Qinzhou Second White" is produced in Qinzhou. It is like light wine, slightly fermented. It is soft in texture and adequately sweet. (Packaging Method) Same as above.</p>
<p>"Hui'an Second White" is produced in Hui'an. The color is slightly lighter than Qinzhou goods. It has no aroma, is drier, and is adequately sweet. (Packaging Method) Same as above.</p>
<p>"Mianhu White" is produced in Chaozhou. It is white in color and excessively sweet. It is divided into five types, with the highest grade being "Zu San Jian" (足三肩). The color is as white as TaiKoo's Four-Temperature Sugar, and the sweetness surpasses it. The texture is neither dry nor wet and is fine. (Function) If you would use 10 catties of foreign sugar, this grade requires only 8 catties. The next grade is "Zu Bing" (足冰). The color is as white as TaiKoo's Three-Temperature-and-a-Half Sugar, and the other characteristics are the same as above. The next grade is "Binghua White" (冰花白). The color is as white as TaiKoo's Three-Two-Five Sugar, and the other characteristics are the same as above. The next grade is "Shuang Gai" (雙蓋). The color is like TaiKoo's Three-Temperature Sugar, the texture is slightly coarser, and the other characteristics are the same as above. The lowest grade is "Dan Gai" (單蓋). The color is like light-colored brown sugar, and the texture and sweetness are the same as above. (Packaging Method) Inner bamboo basket, outer cloth wrap, tied with rope.</p>
<p>"Huizhou White" is produced in Huizhou. The color is white, similar to upper Bing, but the aroma is slightly inferior, the texture is fine, and the sweetness is adequate. (Packaging Method) Double cloth wrap, tied with double rattan.</p>
<p>"Qiongzhou White" is produced in Qiongzhou. The color, taste, texture, and packaging method are all the same as above.</p>
<p>"Huizhou Foreign" is produced in Huizhou. The color is as white as TaiKoo's Three-Temperature Sugar, the sweetness is adequate, and the texture is soft and glutinous. (Packaging Method) Same as above. In Summary, The Sweetness and Aroma of These Various Types of Domestically Produced White Sugar All Far Surpass Imported Goods. It's a Pity that Production is Limited, and Some Have Not Been Available for a Long Time. Now That Foreign Sugar is Becoming Expensive, Domestically Produced Sugar Has Room to Move, so Efforts Should Be Made to Promote It.</p>

<p>| No. 4 of World Customs and Ballads |</p>
<p>The natives have long resided in the South Seas islands, and love to collect antique jars as rare treasures. They are scattered like stars, never too many, and stacked like beds and houses, still feeling it's too few. Ask them how much property they have? Just count the jars to answer. The value of one jar can be a thousand gold pieces. One jar broken means a thousand gold pieces broken. Every spring and autumn, they host feasts for guests, and have a grand gathering of antique jars. They arrange rows of jars and urns, and among the layers, which is the most precious? Antique jars, antique jars, not all the same. Some are suitable for facing forward, some are suitable for facing sideways. The white ones have patterns like the belly of a fish, and the speckled ones can have colors like dragon scales. All kinds of colors are provided for guests to view, and red silk decorations are added everywhere. Praises rise, and the guests are happy. The host is delighted and has face. What is the pleasure of showing off? It is difficult for a king in the south to change this. If the guests are not satisfied, and think it is not enough to entertain their eyes, any sound of seeking flaws and finding fault is a great humiliation to the host. The distinction between honor and disgrace lies in a jar. Everyone loves to play with the jars and urns. Even if they go bankrupt, what does it matter? If the jar is good, its name crowns the crowd. Don't you see the South Seas village chief with his head held high? Ruling a village like a country. The people whisper in the streets, "This is the great king of antique jars." | Note: In wealthy South Seas families, no expense is spared to collect many fine jars. One need only be publicly recognized as the great king of antique jars, and that person has the hope of being elected as the leader of a village.</p>

<p>— Yongzi</p>
<p>| Only I Am Supreme |</p>
<p>Once, I was sent on official business to a certain county in northern Jiangsu. Starting from the Shanghai office, I used a total of ten modes of transportation: tram, train, horse carriage, ferry boat, automobile, rickshaw, inland steamboat, wheelbarrow, roll ferry, and sampan. Finally, after disembarking from the sampan, I hired three round-headed, square-footed people who took turns carrying a small green-draped official sedan chair, entering the city with loud calls to clear the way. People avoided me, looking askance. I sat comfortably in the chair, looking down on everything, very majestic.</p>
<p>Considering that I, who have two crooked legs and brave wind, frost, rain, and snow, am squeezed in the distance between the office and the pavilion-style residence, and in the tens of thousands of people, I remember using eleven modes of transportation from different eras. Although this is not a brand new experience, I must carve out a piece of my heart to sing praises to all the scientists of the past and present, from ancient times to the present, from north to south, east to west, who have invented these many modes of transportation, neglecting sleep and food, and to all the great craftsmen who have labored hard to manufacture these many modes of transportation for us to enjoy. At the same time, I am even more grateful to my fellow Chinese compatriots who strive to preserve the national essence while also loving and adopting foreign goods. If China were not China, people in the 20th century would probably rarely be able to enjoy so many material civilizations in an orderly manner within three or four days, because many of these things have long been abandoned by people in Western civilized countries. This point, perhaps no one can laugh at. Because the great scientist who invented the airplane may not even match the variety of modes of transportation I sat on that time in his whole life, even though I have never taken the airplane that is supposed to save the country.</p>
<p>This eclectic situation, like ox urine and horse dung, or broken drum skin, perfectly symbolizes the Chinese national character. Classics must be zealously protected, slang is equally welcomed. Remaining loyal to one's husband is worthy of praise, while open marriage needs to be promoted urgently.</p>
<h3 id="e257">Wharf Pickup <a href="#e257" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c257" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">257</a></h3>
<p>— Yunshi</p>
<p>| On-Water Operations |</p>
<p>In every commercial port's inn for travelers, there is a special class of servant, different from the usual tea room staff, called "wharf pickup (接江)"; they don't rely on lighters (躉船), and travelers who are not used to it often think that this kind of operation has a bit of risk. As soon as they hear the steamship's whistle in the distance, they rush to their work as if flying. In ports like Shanghai, ships usually enter during the day, but in Zhenjiang, Nantong, Jiangyin, and other ports, ships often dock in the pitch-black night. Every time I go to Shanghai, before the ship docks, I see small sampans like floating gulls swarming to kiss the steamship, a group of so-called "wharf pickup" personnel. As soon as they touch an iron railing of the ship, or any place on the outer hull where they can put their feet, they climb up, as nimble as monkeys. In an instant, their shouts rise together, "Want to go to XXX?" "Want to go to XX?" shaking the entire ship. It is said that they are responsible for taking passengers back to the hotel, but they don't care about the trivial operations. Like the wharf pickup personnel operating along the Shanghai-Yangzhou line, their operations are even more laborious. If it is a traveler disembarking at Longwoko, they board the ship at Tianxingqiao on the river to pick up passengers. They also serve as both wharf pickup and drop-off personnel because these ports do not have lighters (躉船); passengers get on and off relying entirely on a number of sampans. If you are carrying a little luggage and don't have wharf pickup or drop-off personnel, you can't get on and off. Getting off the ship at these ports is often late at night. They brave wind and cold, eat in the rain and snow, cautiously take care of the passengers' luggage, and help them off the ship. When we accidentally pass by once, we always cry out in bitterness! They do this every day, making a living in this vast river. I once saw a wharf pickup personnel jump up when he was still five feet away from the ship, and the passengers all criticized him for taking such a risk. He calmly replied, "I'm used to it to get ahead of the others and pick up passengers." I couldn't help but sigh! "Nothing in the world is as difficult as earning a living!"</p>
<p>That year, the Datong Shipping Company's "New Daming" was deliberately rammed by the Japanese merchant ship "Atsuta" Maru for straying off the shipping route, and it is said that seven or eight wharf pickup personnel were killed. They could have avoided accidental dangers, not boarding the ship and walking dozens of miles to pick up passengers, but for business competition, they still scrambled to solve the bread problem on the water.</p>

<p>— Zhen</p>
<p>Commander Su Gong Tie'an, a famous anti-Japanese general, was a refined and elegant Confucian general with peerless achievements in both poetry and literature. His poem "On Recalling the Past at Forty" has been echoed by many at home and abroad, and it has been praised as a masterpiece in literary circles. He and General Ma Zhanshan once fought against the violent Japanese with an isolated army in a remote area, and when the ammunition and supplies ran out, they retreated into Soviet Russia, and then his singing fell silent for a long time. Last year, he sent a letter to Cai Gong in Lingnan, containing four poems expressing his feelings at the end of the year, which were passionate and high-spirited, echoing through the heavens. His ambitions have not been fulfilled, alas, alas. I now record them below, when he was still stationed in Hailar. The beacon fires fill the sky and have not yet stopped. How many are drunk and how many are awake? I will use my iron blood to save the world, and occasionally write about my pure heart to nourish my soul. The snow covers the lonely city, and the reed pipes are blown hoarsely. The stars entwine the desert, and the sword light is bloody. (Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang have fallen one after another, and it is fortunate to be able to survive outside the Xing'an Mountains. Leaning on my sword and singing, I cannot help but feel melancholy.) Looking back on the events of the past twenty-five years, I have lost my youth and my temples are gray. (He left home and joined the army twenty-five years ago.) The banners shine brightly on the camp of ten thousand men. The old horses neigh sadly all night long. I still hope to repay my long-cherished wish to resist the enemy, and I cannot bear to let down the common people in securing the border. The war clouds pass by in the blink of an eye, leaving thousands of miles empty. The game of chess is sad, and another game is lost. Reining in my horse and looking from a high point in the western mountains, where is the Great Wall? The crane's warning consumes effort in strategic planning. I compete to see the pillar standing firm in the middle of the current. The sword energy flies up to the heavens, and the military sound is awakened, shaking the Dipper constellation. Righteousness has the song of Wen Songrui, and devotion to the country has the Marquis of Wu. (He admired Marquis Wu and Wen Songrui the most in his life.) Studying green history by the light of a lamp at the end of the night, who can compare with the ancients in all ages? Snowflakes like palms press on the saddle, and the watchman's clapper is desolate, and another year ends. For two years, we have been gnashing our teeth in the same hatred. (In the defense against Russia, Generals Han and Wei were killed in action. On the second anniversary, he specially sent Chief of Staff Wang to cross the border to the tombs of the two generals to represent him in paying respects, recalling their loyalty and mourning their deaths.) I entrust the three borders again alone with my liver and guts. Clouds lie across the ancient fortress, and the lonely smoke is straight. The wind rolls the clear sand, and the setting sun is cold. I carry the heavy burden of home and country on one shoulder, and I do not have time to rest morning and night. (Moved to help the Northeast Volunteer Army.)</p>

<p>Chapter 1: Pushing Food With Attentive Solicitude, He Specifically Invites a Poor Girl to Recall; People Are Generous and Uniquely Possess the Heroism of a Warrior</p>
<p>When it was almost dark, the servant of the Gan family stood outside the courtyard and shouted, "Old Lady, is your millet porridge ready yet? Our Second Master told us to get some porridge." Madam Jiang was puzzled, "How would he know we're cooking porridge?" She replied, "It's ready. Come and get some." The elder daughter quickly took the porcelain pot into the house, filled it full of porridge, and held it out with both hands. Madam Jiang, inside, heard her say softly, "I washed the rice for this porridge myself, and it's very clean. I don't know if your Second Master wants it salty or sweet, so I didn't buy any pickles." Hearing this, Madam Jiang knew the reason why the family was suddenly cooking porridge this afternoon. The elder daughter came back into the house, and Madam Jiang pretended not to know anything. She lit a lamp and put it on a table by the bedside kang, continuing to do her work. The elder daughter said, "Mom, you don't want to eat porridge, do you? I'll cook a bowl of noodles for you." Madam Jiang said, "Why are you making noodles when you've already cooked porridge?" The elder daughter said, "Because I know you don't like to drink millet porridge." Madam Jiang said, "Since you knew I didn't like to drink millet porridge, why did you cook such a big pot?" Saying this, she left the elder daughter speechless, only smiling faintly. She busily took the pot off the stove and put the stove back into the kang opening. She served two bowls of porridge and put a bowl of cold salted turnip shreds from the drawer on the table. Then she dragged a broken chair close to the table, picked up her chopsticks, and slowly chewed two turnip shreds in her mouth. Madam Jiang said, "You don't like to drink millet porridge either, do you? If you're cooking it for Second Master Gan, don't cook so much." The elder daughter lowered her head, held the porridge bowl to her lips, and slowly sipped it. Madam Jiang felt that these words might be somewhat embarrassing to her daughter, so she said, "The affairs of the world are truly hard to say. Wealthy families are tired of eating chicken, duck, fish, and meat, and want to drink millet porridge. We people who are tired of eating millet porridge can't even get a meal of dumplings." Just as she was saying this, she heard footsteps in the courtyard outside, and someone asked, "Who is it?" A man laughed and said, "It's me. I don't have anything to do. I've come to thank your family." After saying this, he left. This was Second Master Gan speaking. Madam Jiang laughed, "It's always like this. He shows up as soon as you mention him. Fortunately, we didn't say anything bad about Second Master, or there would have been trouble if he had heard it." The elder daughter said, "Second Master Gan isn't that kind of person. He wouldn't hold a grudge over small things." Madam Jiang, because her daughter was saying this, didn't argue with her. So, she didn't say anything more.</p>

<h3 id="e261">A Short Account of Watching the Sunrise on the Summit of Mount Tai <a href="#e261" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c261" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">261</a></h3>
<p>— Pingcao</p>
<p>Watching the sunrise on the summit of Mount Tai has long been a beautiful scene I've heard of; the actual experience of the sunrise at the summit of Tai is something I only experienced last year. In mid-September of autumn, a friend and I, after exerting ourselves for half a day, finally reached the summit at sunset. The desolation all around makes you suspect you've entered a dead town at the gates of hell. The piercingly cold wind carries with it a sharp whistling sound. Amidst the misty, undulating hills, a few vermilion pointed roofs of temples are revealed. The intermittent sound of temple bells tells you that there is still a kind of reclusive humanity on this mountain top.</p>
<p>We climbed towards that largest vermilion pointed roof for about another mile before reaching the side of that temple. Climbing a few stone steps, we could see the three large characters "Bixia Palace" on the wall of the gate tower. Looking inside, it was a deep, dark cavern. Deep inside, there was a light, a pale yellow light, illuminating an embroidered curtain, with golden figures of ox-headed monsters standing on both sides. Wisps of smoke floated from the incense burner. The threshold, pillars, and walls all revealed faint outlines. This was a sacred hall. Looking at this kind of eerie scene, we felt as if we were in the lair of mountain ghosts and spirits. A gust of cold wind blew, and we couldn't help but feel our hair stand on end, trembling with cold. Just as we were hesitating, a dog suddenly darted out from inside, barking a few times, followed by a monk who greeted us, and we slowly breathed a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>Because of the fatigue from climbing the mountain all day, we ate the vegetarian meal prepared by the monk, instructed him to wake us up tomorrow morning when it was time to see the sunrise, and then went to sleep hastily.</p>
<p>The next day, it wasn't even dawn when we both woke up. Without waiting for the monk to wake us, we got up and walked towards the Sun Viewing Pavilion. Clouds and snow were everywhere, and we couldn't see people on the opposite side. We climbed up along the stone path, and the strong wind made it difficult to breathe. Dark clouds were densely packed under our feet, and a few cold stars twinkled above our heads. Suddenly, a line of color appeared in the clouds in the east, slowly dyeing into a colorful glow. In the shimmering light of the glow, a red trace cracked open, growing larger and larger, and immediately turned into an arc shape. It jumped a few times, as if struggling, and then suddenly a full, huge crimson wheel jumped out. The red light below rose and fell suddenly, shaking for a while, and then slowly the colors faded. It is said that the red light is the seawater in the East Sea, and the sun emerges from the sea after bathing. This is certainly a mythological legend, but its clean and bright form is indeed very much like a passionate, just-bathed beauty.</p>
<p>As the crimson wheel rose, the clouds and mist gradually dissipated, only the wind was still blowing wildly as before. The stone tablet on the Sun Viewing Pavilion was faintly discernible. After touching and reading it, we learned that it was an imperial stele from the Qianlong period of the Qing Dynasty. Although the era was not far off, it was eroded by time, and ravaged by wind and rain, and most of the characters between the lines were no longer recognizable. We still returned along the same route, passed the Jade Emperor Peak, and viewed Li Si's Feng Chan Stele. The ancient sites near the Sun Viewing Pavilion, such as the Qingdi Palace, Yuanjun Palace, Dongyue Temple, Confucius Temple, Peach Blossom Cave, and Luban Cave, were all visited one by one. When we returned to Bixia Palace, the monk had already laid out the morning vegetarian meal. While eating, he talked a lot about the situation in the mountains. What made him most sigh was that in recent years, the number of people visiting the mountain had decreased, and the reduction in incense money for his temple was half of what it used to be, while the local government still levied incense donations on schedule. After giving the money for food and lodging, as we were about to leave, the sunlight was hanging on the treetop of an old pine tree in front of the palace.</p>

<p>(Peiping) It is heard that Tang Yulin once drove from Gubeikou towards Peiping because he did not know the attitude of the inland towards him, but later he heard that the Peiping authorities had ordered his arrest, so he took another route or will enter Chahar through Duolun. Tang's residence in Peiping has been closed by the police today. Several suitcases and cars belonging to Tang have been intercepted in Gubeikou. (7th Reuters)</p>
<p>(Peiping) Tang's two sons, Tang Zuorong and Tang ZuoFu, have fled to Dalian. His family in Peiping, including Tang's mother and seven concubines, a total of 113 people, carried more than 300 boxes of property and opium and fled to the British Concession Xingye Bank in Tianjin on the morning of the 5th. The Peiping-Rehe Provincial Government Office and Tang's residence have been sealed off. (7th Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Peiping) Sun Dianying sent a telegram from the front, saying: "To all newspaper offices, I have learned that our army was ordered to go to the ChuiZi Mountain Weichang area to assemble and await orders. As soon as we arrived, we received reports that Kailu and Suidong had fallen. I immediately led Ding's Brigade, three regiments, and rushed to Chifeng overnight. We arrived in the city late the next day. The Winter and Early troops retreated one after another. The enemy troops tracked and pursued us. Gunshots rang out near Chicheng. More than ten enemy planes dropped bombs. Kuiyuan pacified the friendly troops, chose a place to the rear to accommodate them, and supervised the team to fight back. The enemy launched a fierce attack with tanks, infantry, and cavalry. After a day and night of bloody battle, we recaptured the villages and towns of Jianchangyingzi, Sashuipo, Caiyuanzi, Liangdian, and Hala Kun'an northeast of Chicheng, killing four or five hundred enemies. Kuiyuan personally led the regimental commanders, three officers were killed in succession, two officers were wounded, and nineteen officers were wounded, and more than one hundred and seventy soldiers were wounded or killed. We were planning to telegraph the Weichang troops for reinforcements, but all the telegraph lines were out of order, and the radio station was also bombed. Chicheng is about three hundred miles away from Weichang. We ordered the reinforcement troops to be transferred, and just as they were setting out from Weichang, they were attacked by the enemy again. The fighting was mixed for two days and nights in both Chicheng and Weichang. Suddenly, we heard that Pingquan and Chengde had fallen one after another, and the rear was cut off. Both supplies and ammunition could not be delivered. Kuiyuan personally led the three infantry regiments, which had neither cavalry nor artillery, and were short of food and ammunition. In addition, they were in an area surrounded on all sides, so we were determined to fight a desperate battle with our troops northwest of Weichang. We launched an attack on Gongye Mansion through Lengquantang Xindian in the early evening, and drove back the enemy in the area and the area around Shizhizi Xiaozhaofang. We have joined forces with our Liu Brigade. Just as we were sending a telegram, we received reports that a large part of the three routes of Chifeng, Jianping, and Ningcheng were attacking us fiercely. The front team has already made contact. Kui is still leading the team to meet the attack in order to achieve the final effect. The province has fallen, and Yuguan has fallen. Our officers and soldiers have long had the determination to never coexist with the Japanese bandits. Therefore, in the midst of ice and snow, with frozen and hungry bodies, we fought against the enemy's steel, with blood flying everywhere, and never discouraged. However, the terrain in the Rehe area is vast, and the strength of one army cannot take care of the overall situation. We are very sad. I hope you will pay attention to our small sincerity. Kuiyuan, Commander of the 41st Army, bows. Yin Chen Yin, 7th Dispatch"</p>

<p>The Volunteer Army Consists Mostly of Cavalry, and Defending Dangerous Places is Not Their Strength</p>
<p>Subsequent Transportation is Convenient, Easy to Contact, and Can Be Defended for a Long Time</p>
<p>Since the fall of Chengde, eight or nine out of ten parts of Rehe Province have fallen into the hands of the enemy, causing a national shock. A reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency specially visited Mr. Xiong BingSan at his residence this morning to inquire about the future of the situation in the north. Mr. Xiong replied as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e275">North China Can Still Be Supported <a href="#e275" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c275" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">275</a></h3>
<p>The stationed troops within the territory of Rehe are complicated, the command cannot be unified, and the transportation is extremely difficult. Its failure has been expected for a long time. However, the report that we will defend Gubeikou and Xifengkou is not accurate. The south of Chengde and Luanping, and the north of the Great Wall are all mountainous areas with very dangerous terrain, bordering Hebei Province. Transportation is more convenient, and the education and deployment of the troops are very different from those in Rehe Province. It is possible to defend it and not retreat to the mouths of the Great Wall, Xifeng, and Gubei.</p>
<h3 id="e276">The Volunteer Army is Mostly Cavalry <a href="#e276" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c276" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">276</a></h3>
<p>As for the saying that the Volunteer Army did not participate in the war, causing the fall of Chengde, it is far from the truth. However, the troops of the Volunteer Army Feng ZhanHai and Li HaiQing are mostly cavalry, and their function is to divide and harass. Now the Rehe war is to defend dangerous places and defend with trenches, which is the strength of the infantry, not the cavalry. Therefore, the effect is very small. Even Tang Yulin's troops are mostly cavalry, and their orders are not unified, and they have no training at all. Therefore, it is not enough to resist the Japanese bandits.</p>
<h3 id="e277">Our Army Lacks Artillery <a href="#e277" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c277" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">277</a></h3>
<p>In the Rehe war, in terms of military equipment, the enemy's strength is very different from ours, and we rely entirely on the terrain, just like the 19th Route Army's response to the war in Shanghai. The enemy attacked with planes and artillery, and we could not respond. We relied on trench warfare for infantry and cavalry charges, but the mountains are mostly stony and difficult to dig trenches. We used heavy artillery to defend, but our army lacked artillery, so it was difficult to defend.</p>
<h3 id="e278">The Volunteer Army Will Retreat to Chahar <a href="#e278" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c278" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">278</a></h3>
<p>In recent days, there have been many rumors that the Volunteer Army has retreated to Gubeikou, and General Zhu Ziqiao has been ordered to personally command, which is ridiculous. Because the Volunteer Army was previously stationed in the Kailu Suidong area, if Kailu and others are not defended, they will retreat to the vicinity of Chifeng. Now that Chengde has fallen, how can the Volunteer Army fly over the Japanese military garrison and go to Gubeikou? Those who know the situation in Rehe can see that it is absurd. The Volunteer Army can only retreat from the Linxi area to the Duolun area of Chahar Province. As for Mr. Xiong himself, he plans to return north within the second time.</p>

<h3 id="e280">US Gold Export Ban Impacts the Entire World <a href="#e280" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c280" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">280</a></h3>
<p>British Exchange Rates in a State of Near Shutdown</p>
<p>France Also Trending Towards Abandoning the Gold Standard</p>
<p>Japanese Stock Exchange Decides to Open Today</p>
<p>India's Purchasing Power Increases Demand for Silver in Our Country</p>
<p>Reuter's, London, 6th - A key figure in the London financial market commented on the impact of the US financial crisis, saying that the problem is extremely significant and that no one can answer it. Britain, apart from the US dollar, is currently conducting foreign exchange trading as usual, but transactions are limited. Generally, people want to wait and see how things develop. Some expect the situation to improve, and the appreciation of the pound is expected. However, efforts are currently being made to prevent the pound from rising too much.</p>
<p>Reuter's, London, 6th - The British government has not criticized the US financial crisis, but is observing the steps taken by the US to deal with its domestic difficulties with sympathetic attention. Banking circles in the Netherlands and France both expect the United States to abandon the gold standard, believing that this is the natural outcome of the financial crisis. Parisian bankers expect a large amount of French capital to be transferred from the United States back to France, as it is considered safer there. Italian financial circles regard the US ban as an unexpected move. The Roman market has now suspended foreign currency trading. Silver and gold brokers in Bombay expect demand for silver from China to increase and India's purchasing power to increase accordingly. Americans traveling in Cairo, Egypt, today could exchange one US dollar for 20 piastres, whereas on Friday one US dollar could be exchanged for 27 Egyptian piasters.</p>
<p>Reuter's, London, 6th - As European capitals speculate about the repercussions of the US banking crisis, a prominent Roman banker published an article stating that even if the United States abandons the gold standard, Italy will not. Opinions in Paris generally do not oppose France's ban on cash exports. The French newspaper "Debate" advises the Bank of France not to transport cash to countries that have abandoned a stable currency, and says that the British Exchange Equalisation Account will no longer be able to control the US dollar, and will now focus all its efforts on the franc and absorb the large amount of cash in France.</p>
<p>Denstu, Tokyo, 7th - Upon receiving news of the US ban on gold exports, Minister of Commerce and Industry Nakajima told reporters that the Japan-US exchange rate in the Japanese grey market had reached $26 USD, and it was expected to rise to $30 USD. As a result, imports and exports will inevitably be greatly affected. If the United States abandons the gold standard, Germany can be considered separately, but France will find it difficult to maintain the gold standard, as will the Netherlands. If the whole world bans gold exports, international trade will inevitably be placed on a special relationship. At present, we can only wait and see how the situation develops. The temporary implementation of a ban on gold exports may continue for a considerable period.</p>
<p>Denstu, Tokyo, 7th - Regarding the impact of the US financial panic on the Japanese textile industry, Seijiro Miyajima, President of Nisshin Spinning, said that although the Japanese textile industry has been greatly affected by the US ban on gold exports, there is no need to be pessimistic overall. The soaring Japanese yen and the falling price of cotton are indeed losses, but they are temporary and not significant. The sharp rise in the Japanese exchange rate is indeed sufficient to prevent exports, but the pound price of competing country Britain will inevitably rise, so there is no need to be pessimistic.</p>
<p>Japan League, Tokyo, 7th - After the US ban on gold exports was announced, private gold traders in Japan estimated that the US exchange rate would rise sharply. On the 6th, they planned to sell cash to the Bank of Japan. As a result of discussions yesterday afternoon between Vice Minister Kuroda of the Ministry of Finance and Director of the Finance Bureau Tomita, it was decided to consult with the Bank of Japan authorities on the 7th to stop the government from purchasing cash.</p>
<p>Havas, Paris, 6th - The US banking crisis has not had a significant impact in France. Among the currencies of various countries, only the French franc, the Dutch florin, and the Swiss franc can currently be exchanged for cash. In terms of finance, France has not had cash reserves in the United States for a long time, and France's trade with the United States was previously a surplus, but this is no longer the case. As for French people buying US securities, it is generally said that given the wealth of the United States, these securities will soon be able to recover their original value. Therefore, today the situation of the French stock exchange and various banks is still the same as before. Foreign rumors that the Bank of France is preparing to assist the US Federal Reserve Bank are actually inaccurate.</p>
<p>Havas, London, 6th - With the banking crisis in the United States, internationally, efforts are now being made to salvage the situation. Today, the Bank of England, the US Federal Reserve Bank, and the Bank of France exchanged information to consider the issue of the US dollar resuming pricing. However, the extent to which the US ban on gold exports will extend beyond what is expected, and whether the price of the US currency will fall as a result, is still unknown to the general public. Britain previously had a system for regulating exchange rates to prevent excessive fluctuations in the pound. After the US ban on gold exports, the regulatory fund must adapt to the new situation. Some people say that it is not appropriate for the pound to rise against the US exchange rate now, so they advocate stabilizing the pound price as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Havas, London, 6th - According to news from New York, the local stock exchange has decided to continue operations, and the opening time will be determined later. US bankers expect the authorities to use all kinds of methods to maintain the gold standard. The "Commercial Daily" reported that some financial officials in France, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Switzerland are prepared to help the United States maintain the gold standard.</p>
<p>Havas, London, 6th - At the close of the stock exchange, the pound rose slightly. The French exchange rate was 88 francs and 30 centimes. There was no market for the US exchange rate.</p>
<p>Denstu, Tokyo, 7th - Yesterday afternoon, the Ministry of Finance invited Vice President Fukai of the Bank of Japan and Director General Kodama of Yokohama Specie Bank to the Ministry of Finance to exchange views on the US financial panic. They all believed that the content of Roosevelt's countermeasures was not very clear, and it could not be determined whether it would develop into a suspension of the gold standard. It was unanimously advocated that we could only wait and see how the situation develops and then dispersed. These kinds of meetings will continue to be held in the future.</p>
<p>China League, Tokyo, 7th - The Nagoya Cotton Yarn Exchange held a meeting this morning and decided to open immediately. Upon hearing the news, the Tokyo Commodity Exchange also convened an emergency meeting. As a result of discussions, it was said that the impact was not significant, and it was decided to open. The situation after the opening was stable. The stock exchanges that have been suspended will open simultaneously tomorrow.</p>

<p>In the Past, Over a Thousand Soldiers Could Control Vietnam</p>
<p>Now, Maintaining Order Requires 10,000 Soldiers</p>
<p>Reuter's, Geneva, 6th - This afternoon, the General Affairs Committee of the Disarmament Conference discussed overseas troops. German representative Nadolny hoped that Germany would be regarded as one of the related countries. French representative Sarraut claimed that certain countries that do not have colonies now will soon participate in the work of countries with colonies in order to develop continents such as Africa. Sarraut is the French Minister of Colonies. People were quite surprised that he made this statement. Before long, the French side issued a formal explanation, saying that Sarraut was referring to Germany's participation in public works, such as building an airport in North Africa. Sarraut continued to discuss the development of colonial nationalism at a non-public meeting of the committee, saying that colonies are now extremely difficult to administer. Taking Vietnam as an example, when he was the Governor-General of Vietnam, he could maintain order with 1,500 soldiers. Now, 10,000 soldiers are needed. It is heard that German Deputy Prime Minister Papen and Foreign Minister Neurath will travel together to Geneva, arriving there at about the same time as British Prime Minister MacDonald and Foreign Minister Simon.</p>

<h3 id="e284">A Study of the Issue of Severing Diplomatic Relations with Japan <a href="#e284" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c284" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">284</a></h3>
<p>Opinions of a Certain Legal Expert</p>
<p>Seven Points Should Be Carefully Considered</p>
<p>Since the Japanese army invaded Rehe, there have been many calls from outside for severing diplomatic relations with Japan. On the 5th, a Central News Agency reporter specifically visited a certain legal expert to inquire about his opinions on severing diplomatic relations with Japan. He was kind enough to express his views from a legal perspective. The following is a summary:</p>
<h3 id="e285">The Consequences of Severing Diplomatic Relations <a href="#e285" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c285" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">285</a></h3>
<p>There are no clear provisions in international law regarding the legal consequences of severing diplomatic relations. Fauchillo's "Treatise on International Conventions: The Resolution of International Disputes" divides international disputes into two types: peaceful methods and coercive methods. Coercive methods can be further divided into retaliation, revenge, detention, severance of diplomatic relations, peacetime blockade, and other types. Fauchillo's writings state that [the severance of diplomatic relations between two countries due to one country destroying the other's property rights does not necessarily lead to a state of war between the two countries]. Hershcy's "International Law" states that the severance of diplomatic relations is a form of protest and is generally used to indicate an unusually tense relationship between the two countries. It may not be difficult to follow up with a war after the severance of diplomatic relations. Lawrence's "Principles of International Law" states that [a country may temporarily sever diplomatic relations with another country for major reasons. However, this kind of behavior is a significant insult and constitutes a sign of rupture, which is very close to a formal war and can actually lead to a formal war]. The opinions of the above-mentioned scholars differ. However, based on historical facts, the severance of diplomatic relations does not necessarily lead to war. The following are some examples: (1) In 1892, Greece and Romania severed diplomatic relations due to the Shi Bo Incident, but the two countries did not engage in war afterwards. (2) In 1903, several countries expressed dissatisfaction with the assassination of King Alexander and severed diplomatic relations with Serbia, but diplomatic relations were soon restored. (3) In 1906, France and Venezuela severed diplomatic relations. In 1913, the two countries signed a protocol to restore diplomatic relations. The protocol stipulated that various demands should be resolved by legal and arbitration methods. (4) During the European War, ten countries including Brussels and Bolivia were only in a state of neutral diplomatic relations with Germany and did not declare war.</p>
<h3 id="e286">The Methods of Severing Diplomatic Relations <a href="#e286" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c286" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">286</a></h3>
<p>There are various ways to terminate diplomatic relations. (1) Complete rupture, giving passports to the diplomatic representatives sent by the country with which diplomatic relations have been severed. (2) Notifying the government of the country concerned of the severance of diplomatic relations and recalling the ambassador to its own country. (3) Notifying the governments of related countries of the termination of diplomatic relations and recalling the minister to its own country. (4) Recalling the minister to its own country and embassy staff and notifying a third country to act on behalf of its interests. (5) Recalling the minister to its own country and leaving a certain member of the embassy to act on its behalf.</p>
<h3 id="e287">The Issue of Severing Diplomatic Relations <a href="#e287" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c287" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">287</a></h3>
<p>If China implements the severance of diplomatic relations with Japan, there are several issues that must be considered. (1) Japan's diplomatic representatives should be given passports and sent back to their country. However, if Japan's diplomatic representatives move to the Shanghai Concession and do not return to their country, putting us in a difficult position, what should we do? (2) After the severance of diplomatic relations, can Japan's concessions in China be taken back? Can all other treaty relations between China and Japan be abolished immediately? (3) If Japanese warships still sail in our territorial waters or dock at our ports, what methods can we use to stop and ban them? (4) Can the Japanese troops stationed in our territory be deported? (5) The severance of diplomatic relations cannot immediately be regarded as an act of hostility or the first step in a declaration of war. However, if the violent Japan is unreasonable and interprets it as such, uses it as an excuse, implements retaliation, withdraws overseas Chinese, and expands its aggression, how will we resist? Because in the League of Nations, we have promised not to take actions to expand the situation. However, if the League of Nations believes that it is an action to expand the situation after the severance of diplomatic relations, what will happen? Furthermore, if Japan or a member of the League of Nations Council or Committee raises the issue of the severance of diplomatic relations and says that it is a step towards engaging in war, will our country's position be affected? (7) It is said that if China wants to invoke Article 16 of the Covenant, it must first sever diplomatic relations with Japan. Otherwise, on the one hand, it wants to ask the powers to implement an economic blockade, while on the other hand, the two countries themselves are still holding friendly talks, which is very contradictory. However, after the severance of diplomatic relations, will various countries immediately be able to assist our country in invoking Article 16 of the Covenant? The above-mentioned issues are all issues that must be carefully considered before severing diplomatic relations with Japan. (Central News Agency)</p>
<h3 id="e288">He Yingqin Passes Through Jinan and Has a Candid Conversation with Han <a href="#e288" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c288" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">288</a></h3>
<p>Han Talks About the Peacefulness of the Shandong Coast</p>
<p>He Says He is Working Hard to Plan Resistance Against Japan</p>
<p>According to a person from Jinan, Minister of Military Administration He Yingqin and Minister of Interior Huang Shaoheng took a train north the other day. When they passed through Jinan, Governor of Shandong Province Han Fuqu, Director of the Department of Civil Affairs Li Shuchun, and Director of the Department of Education He Siyuan, etc., all went to the station to welcome them. He got off the train and shook hands with Han and others to exchange greetings. He then invited Han to board the train for a meeting. After boarding the train, He asked if any news from the front had been received here. Han replied that newspapers had reported that Chifeng and Lingyuan had been lost. He said that he had received a telegram from Yang Gengguang yesterday saying that Chifeng had not been lost and that Sun Dianying's army had arrived, but the situation was still critical. He also asked how the Shandong coast was. Han replied that it was still peaceful, but there was talk that Japanese women and children in Jinan were preparing to return to their country. Qingdao, Yantai, Longkou, and the Jiaoji Railway line were all fine. While they were talking, He received another telegram from Yang Jie saying that Lingyuan had been recaptured and that Sun Dianying's army in Chifeng was pursuing the enemy. Han said that the two ministers must have good plans for going north and that their strength could be equivalent to hundreds of thousands of soldiers. He replied that he would do his best to help Hanqing plan everything. In the future, Hanqing may have to go to the front line to command, and he would also have to ask Xiangfang (Han's character name) for help. Han said that national affairs were not a matter of helping each other. If it was necessary, he would go all out, but he did not want to be fragmented and divide his forces. He was willing to get 30,000 elite soldiers and take charge of one side alone. The supply of food and fodder to the hundreds of thousands of soldiers at the front was the most urgent matter, and the central government had to plan for this. He replied that plans had already been made. He had not been to Jinan for 20 years and saw that many chimneys had been added. He thought it had made great progress. Because when he came to Jinan in the second year of the Republic (1913), there was only one chimney in the electric light company. Han replied that there were now many small factories and three new spinning mills, so there was no need to use foreign goods in the future. He also said that the ministers had a major task. Otherwise, they could get off the train and stay for a while. He replied that when he returned to Beijing, he would get off the train and take a look. The Shandong coast was also very important, and Xiangfang's responsibility was also heavy. They had a candid conversation for about half an hour before Han took his leave and He and others continued north on the same train.</p>

<h3 id="e290">Anhui Province to Convene County Magistrate Conference <a href="#e290" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c290" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">290</a></h3>
<p>To Discuss the Political Infrastructure of Various Counties</p>
<p>and Delineate the Organizational Structure of Various County Governments</p>
<p>Anqing Communication: Wu Zhongxin, Chairman of the Anhui Provincial Government, is striving to reform the politics of the entire province. He plans to convene a conference of county magistrates from the entire province in the near future. The main purpose of this conference is divided into two points: (1) The provincial government believes that the anti-Japanese military situation is becoming increasingly tense. Anhui Province is located in the Jianghuai area, and the situation is particularly important. The political infrastructure of various counties and the maintenance of order should be considered in light of the times and necessary preparations should be made. (2) The finance, education, construction, and public security bureaus under the county governments in Anhui Province were previously ordered by the provincial government to be changed to sections. To date, some have been reorganized in accordance with the order, some are still following the old system, and some have changed their names but the actual organization is no different from before. In order to facilitate administration, the provincial government should unify the organization. The provincial government's standing committee recently discussed and decided on the organizational principles of the county governments. Except for the education bureau, which will temporarily retain the old system due to historical reasons, and the finance bureau, which should be changed to a county finance committee in accordance with the regulations of the Three Provinces Bandit Suppression Headquarters, the remaining construction and public security bureaus will all be changed to sections and directly subordinate to the county government. At this moment, the provincial government has drafted the organizational regulations of the county government in accordance with the above-mentioned principles. Once the provincial government's standing committee passes them, they will be implemented separately. In addition, in order to understand the actual situation of county administration for assessment purposes, Director of the Department of Civil Affairs Luo Liangjian also plans to visit various counties in southern and central Anhui Province for a thorough inspection. He is currently handling all matters in order to start his journey within days. (March 5)</p>

<p>(Reuter's Singapore Communication, March 2) Overseas Chinese born in Southeast Asia are now paying great attention to the study of the Chinese National Language. Therefore, many National Language schools have been established recently. Most of those studying in them are adult overseas Chinese. People in general business circles feel it difficult to travel to the East due to language barriers, especially when traveling along the Chinese coast. Now they are flocking to schools to learn the National Language. Tang Liu, the Chinese Consul-General in Singapore, has launched a National Language competition. Those, whether adults or children, who can speak the National Language fluently can receive prizes.</p>
<h3 id="e292">The Gold Market Crisis is Gradually Stabilizing <a href="#e292" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c292" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">292</a></h3>
<p>The Market Situation Rose Slightly This Morning, Seeming to Have a Turning Point</p>
<p>Banking Circles Say Our Country Has Not Been Affected</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the financial crisis in the United States, coupled with rumors of the abolition of the gold standard, has had a severe impact on the financial markets of various countries. The financial market in this city was also affected yesterday, with the price of gold plummeting and people's hearts shaken. As of this noon, the decline has not slowed down slightly. This morning's market situation opened at 682 taels, then fell sharply to 677 taels. Then, due to news that the United States was maintaining the gold standard, it gradually turned around and rose to 692 taels. Looking at the market situation this morning, the ups and downs in an instant reached a difference of more than ten taels, which is indeed an unprecedented change in the financial world. It is expected that there will still be drastic changes in the afternoon. The reporter of China Central News Agency revisited a senior official in the banking world this morning and asked whether the US order banning cash exports would affect the banking world in our country. According to the answer, US President Roosevelt ordered a ban on cash exports and announced that various banks would suspend operations for several days in order to resolve the financial crisis during this period. The ban on cash exports has absolutely no impact on the country, and it is predicted that the sharp drop in the price of gold will be very short-lived.</p>
<p>According to New Voice News Agency, yesterday's sharp drop in the price of gold was due to the fact that the US exchange rate was priceless and the gold market could not open, which led to inquiries to the gold trading industry. Therefore, the gold trading exchange held a meeting all night yesterday to discuss solutions. Fortunately, this morning's gold market opened at 82 taels, the lowest was 76 taels, and the closing price was 92 taels. The crisis seems to have subsided.</p>

<h3 id="e296">Entire Communication in Rehe Suspended Today <a href="#e296" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c296" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">296</a></h3>
<p>The Administration Officially Ordered All Bureaus This Morning to Cease Acceptance</p>
<p>The Telegraph Department of Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, and Rehe Ordered a Halt to Dispatching</p>
<p>The Datong News Agency reports that since the fall of Chengde, all news from Rehe has been cut off. Postal and telegraph services to Rehe originating from Shanghai have been temporarily suspended as of this morning. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Entire Communication in Rehe Suspended　The Shanghai Postal Administration's Parcel Office has already announced the suspension of accepting parcels for Rehe since yesterday morning. As of 8:00 AM this morning, the Shanghai Bureau Management Office issued a formal notice to temporarily suspend the acceptance of ordinary letters and parcels destined for Rehe Province. All subordinate branches were instructed to comply. The notice stated: "To whom it may concern, we hereby relay Postal General Bureau torpedo number 84. In addition to reiterating previous instructions, all mail and parcels for various locations within Rehe Province should be immediately suspended from acceptance and dispatch." We hereby inform you for your information and compliance. Mail Management Office, March 7th.</p>
<p>Postal Workers Advance and Retreat with the Troops　According to a statement from a General Bureau official, the Tianjin Postal Bureau has not yet provided any reports regarding postal services in Rehe. Therefore, a procedure for handling Rehe mail has not yet been established. The previous temporary suspension of acceptance was merely a provisional measure. As for postal personnel in Rehe, although they are in dire straits, there is no need for evacuation. The current situation in Rehe is merely a temporary wartime disorder, unlike the explicitly blockaded Northeast provinces. Now that the central government has strictly ordered the army to counterattack, the postal bureaus and personnel in that region should advance and retreat with the troops. There is absolutely no need for evacuation.　Suspension of Telegrams to Four Provinces　The Shanghai Telegraph Bureau also received an order from the Ministry of Communications yesterday, instructing that telegrams to Liaoning, Jilin, Rehe, and Heilongjiang be suspended from acceptance. According to an official at the Telegraph Bureau, telegrams to the Northeast regions were still being accepted and dispatched by the bureau last week, but very few were able to reach their destination, and some could not be delivered at all. Only yesterday afternoon (March 6th) did the Ministry of Communications send a telegram instructing that telegrams to Rehe, Heilongjiang, Liaoning, and Jilin be temporarily suspended from acceptance and dispatch. Therefore, the bureau has officially ceased accepting telegrams to the aforementioned regions starting today.</p>

<p>Name Change Is Also Not True</p>
<p>Since the Postal General Bureau began collecting the parcel tax, it has been repeatedly opposed by all parties. The Ministry of Communications has issued an order to suspend it. However, because it has already been implemented, it is inconvenient to stop it. There were rumors that the name would be changed. This morning, a Datong News Agency reporter visited Huang Naishu, Director-General of the Postal General Bureau. Mr. Huang was out on official business. According to those around him, the Bureau has decided to comply with the order and exempt the parcel tax. The rumors of a name change are also untrue.</p>

<h3 id="e302">Stole Older Brother's Handgun for a Friend <a href="#e302" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c302" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">302</a></h3>
<p>Liu Peide Was Young and Inexperienced</p>
<p>Xu Fengbin Was Daring and Reckless</p>
<p>Zhang Jinhai and Xu Fengbin, natives of Tongzhou, were unemployed and staying at room 132 of the Hongyun Hotel at number 1009 Hainin Road. They had pawned all their clothes and were unable to make a living. A Cantonese friend, Liu Peide, 16 years old, was studying at a certain school and lived at number 77, Tongchangli, on the same road. (His older brother, Liu Ruoqun, was a special constable and carried a handgun.) Liu visited the hotel and Zhang and Xu asked for his help, saying they were penniless and it was difficult to make it. They claimed there was an opportunity to get money but they didn't have a handgun to accomplish their goal. Zhang Juryong, a native of Zhenjiang, opened a flower gambling den at number 318 nearby and was making good money. If Liu had a handgun, they could impersonate police officers and borrow dozens of silver dollars from him. They asked if Liu could borrow a handgun and begged him to help. Liu readily agreed. He returned home while his brother was out, found the key hidden in the drawer where the handgun was kept, and took it. He carried it with him and went to the hotel again at [divination] time yesterday morning. He showed them the handgun and said it was ready to go. Zhang and Xu were overjoyed and went to Zhang Juryong's house and falsely claimed they were there to catch gamblers. They pointed to Liu Peide and claimed he was an investigator from the HSBC police and that if they paid ten silver dollars, they would be fine. Zhang Juryong panicked and gave Xu a cloth coat to pawn. Xu went to the Shunli Pawnshop near the North Jiangxi Road and Laobazi Road and got only six silver dollars. He gave Zhang Juryong a pawn ticket and one silver dollar and asked Zhang Juryong to make up the remaining money. They agreed on a date to pay. Liu and the other two returned to the hotel and Zhang Juryong secretly reported it to the Hongkou police, accusing them of extortion and intimidation, practically robbery. Detectives Zhang Faxiang and Wang Runhe secretly went to the hotel and arrested Liu and the other two. They found five silver dollars on Xu. They were taken into custody along with Tao Xiaohai, a native of Tongzhou who was also suspected. Upon questioning, Liu said the handgun was at his home in the drawer and locked. The detectives went to his brother and explained the case. They took the handgun as evidence. This morning, they were sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin detailed the case and stated that Liu Peide's brother was completely unaware that his brother had stolen the handgun. The police did not prosecute him and the handgun was returned to him. Zhang Hua, the wife of Zhang Juryong, testified. Liu Peide said the handgun was his brother's and that Xu and Zhang asked him for help. He did not receive any money. Lawyer Ye Shaoying defended him. Xu and Zhang claimed that because the plaintiff opened a flower gambling den and a large gambling den, they were destitute and borrowed money from him. The court ordered them to be remanded in custody and set a date for sentencing. Tao Xiaohai was released.</p>
<h3 id="e303">Verdicts Delivered Separately This Morning in the Kidnapping Case of Sun Yangru <a href="#e303" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c303" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">303</a></h3>
<p>Three Convicts Sentenced to Death</p>
<p>Other Sentences Varied</p>
<p>Sun Yangru, a 47-year-old native of Anhui, served as the manager of Tongfeng Company at number 25 Renji Road. On December 4th of last year, at 4:00 PM, Sun was driving his private car to visit a friend at number 67 Xieqiao Road, Jing'an Temple Road, when he was suddenly met by several kidnappers armed with weapons, who kidnapped Sun and demanded a large ransom. Sun's family, after Sun was kidnapped, proceeded with the procedures for preparing the ransom for his release, without reporting to the police. Subsequently, Lu Liankui, Chief Detective of the General Investigation Division of the Public Concession Police, received a report from an informant and immediately began an investigation. As a result, the location of the hostage was discovered. He supervised detectives Liu Shaokui, Feng Zhiming, Shao Jingfan, etc., and rescued Sun safely at a foreign house number 5, Yideli, Raul Road in the French Concession. At that time, the kidnappers Lu Ge and Wang Yaohua tried to escape over the roof. Lu fell to the ground and died on the spot, and Wang was seriously injured and arrested. Subsequently, the kidnappers Yang Baofu, Tang Jinsheng, Ma Lisang, Gao Shanqing, Wang Weichuan, Wu Anwen, Guo Yusheng, Wang Chunshan, Jia Jinshan, Wang Jingtang (former captain of the Municipal Public Security Bureau's Water Patrol Team), Li Xitang (Sun Yangru's brother-in-law), Chen Chenshuo (director of the Jiangdu Poor Children's Home), women Wu Wangshi and Wang Dingshi were arrested one after another. A handgun, more than 30 bullets, and a car number 6335 used for kidnapping were confiscated. Wang Jingtang's private car number 11624 was also confiscated. Police lawyer Ru Baoyi filed a public prosecution with the First Special Court in accordance with the Regulations on the Punishment of Bandits. The Special Court repeatedly interrogated and concluded the case. The details have been published in this newspaper. This morning, Qian Hongye, President of the Criminal Tribunal, ascended to the Criminal Tribunal One and announced the verdicts. Yang Baofu, Tang Jinsheng, and Wang Yaohua were each sentenced to death. Ma Lisang, Gao Shanqing, and Wu Anwen were each sentenced to life imprisonment, and each was deprived of their civil rights for life. Guo Yusheng and Wang Chunshan were each sentenced to fifteen years of imprisonment. Wang Weichuan, Jia Jinshan, and Chen Chenshuo were each sentenced to seven years of imprisonment. For all defendants other than those sentenced to death or life imprisonment, the number of days detained before the determination of the judgment was offset against the imprisonment by two days for one day of imprisonment. Wu Wangshi, Wang Dingshi, and Li Xitang were all found not guilty. The handgun, bullets, and car number 6335 were all confiscated. After the verdict, the court adjourned.</p>

<p>"Chengde Falls, Tang Yulin Flees Without Fighting" Such large headline characters stabbed into our eyes in the newspaper. Which patriotic person did not beat their chest and stomp their feet? Who didn't want to grab him and tear him into pieces? Even Comrade Zhang, famous throughout the world for his "non-resistance policy", couldn't help but thunder and "order the arrest of Tang Yulin, and if caught, he will be executed to uphold the law of the land". How righteous, how grand, how just. Therefore, we ordinary people cannot help but believe that Young Marshal Zhang is indeed a "vanguard against Japan", indeed a "pillar of the nation", and we cannot help but "tighten our belts and economize", "destroy our homes to relieve the nation's difficulties", and diligently wire one ten-thousandth of our property to Prince Shuncheng's mansion, begging him to sacrifice himself for the country. From then on, accumulating little by little will lead to success in resisting Japan. There is great hope. In the future, there is even the possibility of doing cigarette advertising.</p>
<p>The old rascal Tang Yulin also found out that as long as he "declared" resistance against Japan, he would have money coming in. So, after being a prince and minister under the reign of Xuantong for more than a year, he also said that he would "fight to the end". But the Japanese imperialists refused to let him play both sides, and the old running dog was naturally unwilling to make it real. So, after thinking for a moment, a plan came to him. He immediately packed his belongings, loaded them on a car, and the so-called "fleeing without fighting" in the newspaper was actually a donation to the master.</p>
<p>From this point of view, his "declaration of resistance" and "fleeing without fighting" were clearly planned in the great plan of saving the country. The painted face takes one step forward, and the small painted face takes two steps back. They had already discussed it clearly behind the stage. Moreover, he is the direct successor of the "non-resistance policy", so of course he has to abide by the family tradition. However, the people of the country cannot forgive him, and they scold the wooden puppet instead of the one pulling the strings. Comrade Zhang can give the three northeastern provinces to his grandfather as a gift and become an important figure in the party and state, while Tang Yulin is only imitating his predecessors by giving away one province, and he is to be "arrested" and "executed". How very very much indeed.</p>
<p>However, Tang Yulin's deserving to die is beyond doubt. Moreover, Comrade Zhang also said that he should be shot after questioning his conscience. Therefore, his heinous crime is imaginable. At the same time, we have now learned another serious lesson: to beg these warlord grandpas to resist imperialism for us is like inviting a thief to guard against thieves. Moreover, in order to thoroughly resist imperialism, we must use the power of our masses to completely eliminate these dogs, and then we can achieve the final victory in the anti-imperialist national revolutionary war.</p>

<h3 id="e307">Artificial Lacquer Oil Varnish <a href="#e307" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c307" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">307</a></h3>
<p>— Leng Mei</p>
<p>Previously, I saw an article about "Natural Lacquer" in this publication, which reminded me of this important "Artificial Lacquer." The main raw material for artificial lacquer is tung oil. Before tung oil was imported, European and American countries used linseed oil as raw material, but its products were less durable and did not dry as easily as artificial lacquer made from tung oil. Artificial lacquer made from tung oil is of good quality, very durable and easy to dry, and waterproof. It is comparable to natural lacquer.</p>
<p>(1) Types 丨 There are many types of artificial lacquer. Generally, they can be divided into three types: (A) Positive Artificial Lacquer "Long oil" Varnish, which contains more tung oil. (B) Neutral Artificial Lacquer "Medium Oill" Varnish, which contains a moderate amount of tung oil. (C) Negative Artificial Lacquer "Short Oil Varnish, which contains less tung oil. The above three types have their own special uses. Positive artificial lacquer is for outdoor use. Neutral artificial lacquer is for flooring. Negative artificial lacquer is for indoor use.</p>
<p>(2) Raw Materials 丨 The raw material ratios for positive, neutral, and negative artificial lacquers are as follows:</p>
<p>A. Positive Artificial Lacquer</p>
<p>Resin 100 pounds (If rosin is used, 10 pounds of lime must be added.)</p>
<p>Tung oil 35 gallons</p>
<p>Copper acetate 3.5 pounds</p>
<p>Acetic acid 1 pound</p>
<p>Turpentine or mineral oil 50 gallons</p>
<p>B. Neutral Artificial Lacquer</p>
<p>Resin 100 pounds</p>
<p>Tung oil 18 gallons</p>
<p>Lead acetate 2 pounds</p>
<p>Cobalt acetate 0.5 pounds</p>
<p>Turpentine 33 gallons</p>
<p>C. Negative Artificial Lacquer</p>
<p>Resin 100 pounds</p>
<p>Tung oil 12 gallons</p>
<p>Lead acetate 1 pound</p>
<p>Cobalt acetate 0.25 pounds</p>
<p>Turpentine 27 gallons</p>
<p>Tung oil and resin are the main raw materials for artificial lacquer, and lead acetate and cobalt acetate are drying agents. Turpentine or mineral oil is a thinning agent.</p>
<p>(3) Equipment 丨 Only two things are needed: a lacquer pot and a resin tank. The lacquer pot should be made of iron, with a capacity of about 100 gallons. The bottom of the pot should be equipped with adjustable moving wheels. The resin tank is made of tung wood, 3 feet high and 1.5 feet in diameter.</p>
<p>(4) Manufacturing 丨 First, dissolve the resin (its melting point should be below 400 degrees Fahrenheit), and place it in the lacquer pot with tung oil. Heat it with a fierce fire to 500 degrees, maintain it for several hours, and wait until a suitable degree of solidification is obtained before extinguishing the fire. When the temperature drops to 300 degrees, add thinning agents such as turpentine to thin it.</p>
<p>If the melting point of the resin exceeds 400 degrees, the resin must first be dissolved with a small amount of tung oil in the resin tank, and then mixed with the remaining tung oil. This oil must also be burned to 500 degrees first.</p>
<p>(5) Inspection 丨 To inspect the quality of artificial lacquer, place a small drop of lacquer on a glass slide. If it appears transparent, it shows that the tung oil and resin are completely combined. Extend it with a finger to form a line. This line should be about 1 foot long. The best ones can be extended to 2 or 3 feet.</p>

<p>The second landlord's pavilion room was empty and rented to a university graduate, who, in addition to having a diploma but no job, also had a wife as beautiful as a flower. Their renting the house broke Shanghai's record: renting for half a month.</p>
<p>This was also due to the kindness of the compassionate second landlady, because this handsome man in a Western suit said:</p>
<p>"······I want to find a job in Shanghai. If there is no hope in another half month, we will go home, so I only want to rent for half a month!"</p>
<p>"Yes! People who go out always have difficulties; then let's do this. The rent is seven yuan a month, and half a month will be four yuan!"</p>
<p>"······" He then took out a silver dollar.</p>
<p>They moved in that afternoon. This was a scholar's wife, a red-dressed girl in the most fashionable style in Shanghai!</p>
<p>It was night, and the pavilion room was filled with teasing laughter.</p>
<p>"Sir! This is······" the second landlord pushed open the pavilion door and asked.</p>
<p>"Her? She is my wife!"</p>
<p>"Oh! That's great! Sir, when you go to sleep, please turn off the light!" "Understood!" He said, "Sit down for a while!" The second landlady then retreated and said, "No! You enjoy yourselves!"</p>
<p>The next morning, the red-dressed girl left and did not return at night. The scholar was upstairs cooking on a gasoline lamp.</p>
<p>"Sir! Why hasn't your young mistress come back even at this time today?" The second landlord pushed in again and asked.</p>
<p>"Oh! She! She is studying at XX Middle School and is staying at the school tonight!" The scholar said.</p>
<p>"Oh! So that's how it is!"</p>
<p>"·················"</p>
<p>"Truly new people!" The second landlady retreated and went downstairs muttering to herself.</p>
<h3 id="e309">The Art of Getting Along in School <a href="#e309" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c309" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">309</a></h3>
<p>— Man</p>
<p>A few days ago, I saw "The Art of Getting Along" in your publication. We young people in school can't help but be eager to talk about our "art of getting along" in school. "Wide social connections" can be regarded as the sacred and inviolable truth of the art of getting along in our school: that is, you must be close to all three levels of teachers (upper level: such as the principal, the director of student affairs, and your own teaching teachers, etc. middle level: such as sports instructors. lower level: such as clerks and accountants, etc.) and three levels of students (upper level: those athletes who look like Red Indians, black faces, and wearing lantern pants. middle level: those bookworms who stay at home and get first place. lower level: the ghosts in the lower grades) up to the tea room in the school and the proprietress of those small shops outside, you have to be close to them all; as for the methods of getting close, they are nothing more than the three highest arts of getting along: "wind", "horse", and "cattle". For example: if you want to get close to those teachers, you have to invite them to a feast, or send them a few silver shields; if that teacher likes to smoke, you have to buy a few cans of Three-Five brand, or at least Cavenders. In short, you have to take advantage of every opportunity to send them what they like. If you want to get close to those athletes, you have to wear the same red hats and lantern pants as them. If you feel that your face is not black, you can grab a handful of mud and smear it on your face; ask for a few boxes of Beauty brand cigarettes in your spare time, or add a few dishes. As for getting close to those hard-working students, (most of the hard-working students are poor) you have to exaggerate, for example, if your surname is Jiang, you say that Chairman Chiang is your uncle, if it doesn't look like it, at least you must say that he is from my family, and you can find them a job after graduation, at least as a county magistrate, and they will naturally be close to you unconditionally. Also, if you have a skill, you must show it off greatly. For example, if you can play football, you have to put on your football shoes and kick a few times on the playground. If you can give a speech, you often have to show off your eloquence. Or if you can write some great works, you have to prepare a wall newspaper. If you can't do any of these things, and you only know how to eat, you must eat seven or eight bowls at every meal, even if your stomach is so full that it is about to burst, you still have to get the reputation of "King of Eating" and get everyone to pay attention to you.</p>
<p>If you do this after "wide social connections", the benefits are self-evident; for example, after you are close to those teachers, when you don't do well on the big exam, they will always give you a 70; if you hate the food in the dining hall and smash a few bowls in anger, of course the student affairs teacher will not see it and record a demerit. Being close to the sports instructor can also give you the opportunity to play a certain ball or be on a certain team to show off. Being close to the red-hatted ones allows you to fight with people and show off your power. Being close to the bookworms allows you to ask them to Pass during the exam while you can go to sleep. Being close to the little ghosts allows you to ask them to do things for you, and being close to the proprietress allows you to pay a few less yuan during the holidays······</p>
<p>In short, people who understand the art of getting along in school can be big shots and beat people······People who don't understand the art of getting along in school can only be little ghosts.</p>

<p>Thursday, February 16th, Sunny</p>
<p>Today, everything is unfavorable, hitting walls everywhere. Because of a friend's affairs, I got another slap in the face. Among animals, humans are perhaps the most lacking in compassion. The most cruel means mostly occur among the so-called "most intelligent" humans: jealousy, satire, adultery, robbery, struggle, slaughter… bizarre and absurd things are all human-to-human specialties. I say: humans are inferior to dogs. At least, a dog's loyalty and honesty are ten thousand times greater than that of humans.</p>
<p>Friday, February 17th, Sunny</p>
<p>In the eternal and imperishable universe, the time occupied by a human life is but a fleeting moment. On the vast and boundless earth, the position occupied by an individual is truly a drop in the ocean. Yet, is it worth engaging in such cutthroat competition for fame and profit? Even at the cost of sacrificing one's life. Today, news came from Bo Tao that Hua An, who was usually as silent as a saint, committed suicide. The reason is unknown. Divine and enlightened deity, laugh at this, laugh at such insignificant people!</p>
<p>Saturday, February 18th, Cloudy</p>
<p>Women, women, all the world's disputes are caused by your red lips and seductive eyes. If there were no such glamorous women among humans, it would be like a windless ocean, calm and peaceful, at least reducing some ridiculous things. Hua An's suicide, it is said, was for a woman, truly laughable! In fact, our frontiers need this kind of worthless head to clash with the enemy. Hua An, if you had died in the right place, you might have earned the title of martyr. Why didn't you think it over beforehand?</p>

<h3 id="e312">Great Difficulty Ahead <a href="#e312" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c312" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">312</a></h3>
<p>— Pan Minshen</p>
<p>Editor Sir:</p>
<p>My cousin, Miss Mou, is not yet twenty years old, and a young widow. She has no children. Besides her parents-in-law, she also has three uncles-in-law. Her husband's family is well-off, but they have not yet divided the property. The wives of the brothers-in-law do not get along well, and there is a strong desire to live separately. Now that her parents-in-law are alive, they can still barely maintain the situation, but once the two elders pass away, she will have no support at all. Her maternal family is not wealthy either, truly a situation of bleak prospects and great difficulty ahead. From the perspective of modern people, in such a situation, of course, remarriage would be the proper course. However, those around her, and she herself, have all been washed by the old moral teachings, so she would never even think of the word "remarriage." One cannot deprive a common person of their will, and others cannot even broach the subject. Now, because she thinks about the darkness of the future, she frowns all day long, her beautiful face fading. As her close relative, I really feel I cannot stand by and do nothing. I ask, does a widow have the right to demand a division of her in-laws' property? Her dowry jewelry is now in the hands of her in-laws. Can she demand its return? Sir, the above questions seem to be outside the scope of "Communication from Shop Employees," but I am indeed a shop employee! Please give me a reply. (The following omitted) Sincerely, Pan Minshen.</p>
<p>XXXX</p>
<p>Editor's Note: What distinguishes humans from animals is that they need to live a spiritual life. A person cannot feel satisfied with material enjoyment alone; they also need spiritual comfort. Pan's cousin's husband is dead, and the love of a couple and the joy of companionship are of course hopeless. And because she has no children, she cannot, like other widows, transfer all her energy to maternal love. In this situation, even if her material aspects have been adequately resolved, we cannot help but advise her to remarry, especially since she faces great difficulty ahead! Therefore, we still advise Pan to persuade her to remarry. One cannot deprive a common person of their will, which is certainly true; however, the degree of persuasion has not yet reached the level of coercion, so there is no question of depriving her of her will! Why can't you broach the subject?</p>
<p>Current laws stipulate that children may not demand the division of parental property, but exceptions are allowed in special circumstances. For example, "If a widow and her in-laws, or a legitimate child and his stepmother, have become estranged and it is difficult to force them to live together, they may be allowed to divide the property and live separately." It seems that Pan's cousin's relationship with her in-laws has not yet reached the point of "estrangement and difficulty in forcing them to live together." However, if there is concrete evidence between her uncles-in-law and brothers-in-law's wives that is sufficient to prove the urgent need to secure future livelihood, they can also file a request for property division. As for the dowry jewelry, it is her private property and she absolutely has the right to demand its return.</p>

<h3 id="e313">Coal Mountain (Continued) <a href="#e313" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c313" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">313</a></h3>
<p>— By Ep Falkowski, Translated by Zhixiang</p>
<p>VI</p>
<p>But now, after the outbreak of fuel competition in New Newland, New York, and other central markets selling hard coal, the impact was immediate. Hard coal mines were only working three or four days a week. Coal washing plants and open-pit mines were shut down, and machines were idle. Many workers felt that the current situation was not even as good as picking coal, chopping firewood, and transporting coal.</p>
<p>At the same time, managers and superiors became increasingly harsh and arrogant. New orders were issued daily from the head office in Pottsville, such as layoffs, reductions in timber, implementation of "dead work" (working without pay), and previously unenforced rules were now strictly enforced, such as smoking, taking leave the day after receiving wages, or arguing with the foreman, all of which were grounds for dismissal.</p>
<p>The cry of "cheap coal" was widespread. "We must now compete with kerosene and soft coal," the managers said. "Miners must cooperate with us to overcome this competition and restore our lost markets. This is our common struggle - it requires us to implement the "cooperation and efficiency" policy stipulated in the contract - each person contributing their part to save the hard coal industry..."</p>
<p>Meetings were being held in many coal-selling cities: managers of mines from various regions and representatives of labor unions were in attendance, all agreeing to reduce mine operating costs. They wore high collars, wide bow ties, and formal attire, indicating their hostility towards living in hotels: they spoke fluently, predicting that the long-awaited peace would restore the prestige of hard coal. Mine managers argued: "We must not strike again, we must defend our markets - workers and company employees must all pay attention to the common good."</p>
<p>After listening to these words, the labor union representatives - of humble origins and still retaining their lowliness - replied firmly and slyly, "The entire industry seems somewhat dubious."</p>

<p>— Cao</p>
<p>The throne has been seized, Greta Garbo should hurry back!</p>
<p>When Greta Garbo first returned to Sweden, who in Hollywood had heard the name Katharine Hepburn? Before "A Bill of Divorcement" was officially released, Americans had anticipated such a great "new discovery"; now that "A Bill of Divorcement" has been selected as one of the ten greatest films, and Katharine Hepburn's achievements are on par with John Barrymore at the forefront of honor, who doesn't know about this new discovery, "American Garbo" Katharine Hepburn?</p>
<p>This nickname was obtained in this way: when "A Bill of Divorcement" was screened, those who saw her high cheekbones and emotional face looked as if they were made from the same mold as the departed Garbo; at the same time,</p>
<p>She also possessed mystery, fearing to speak and even more fearing the pursuit of audiences. Therefore, the neurotic journalists, like discovering a new continent for the motherland, proclaimed that they had discovered a domestic Garbo!</p>
<p>In fact, she fears to speak not only in crowds. On her first day in Hollywood, this new mysterious woman, like Garbo, evaded camera shots in every possible way under the pursuit of film reporters. Even the publicity department of RKO could not obtain any information to promote her. It was only from other sources that they learned that she was twenty-four years old and the daughter of a wealthy family.</p>
<p>The reason why Greta Garbo is called mysterious is because she refuses to disclose anything about herself. Now, Garbo's "mysterious" throne has been seized by her. However, this young, light brown-haired girl has created her own seat. As the December issue of Motion Picture magazine praised her when it nominated her as a star:</p>
<p>We believe she is a great star –</p>
<p>Because she is the loyal model for a 1933 star - young, talented and experienced, and possessing a brilliant personality. Because she is a descendant of the wealthy, acting is her hobby, not a necessity. Because she is a gentle woman never seen on screen. Because she has received stage training and the highest level of education. Because she is "creative" and does not imitate the appearance of anyone on screen.</p>

<h3 id="e315">Review of "Spring Breeze and Willow Branches" <a href="#e315" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c315" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">315</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Hong</p>
<p>In this universe where money is almighty, even so-called sacred male-female "love", although said to be unconditional and without purpose, cannot escape the scope of money. However, is money sufficient to maintain eternal love? This is a question. "Spring Breeze and Willow Branches" is based on this point. It tells the story of a woman who is superstitious about money, taking money as the goal of love, changing her husband three times, abandoning her children twice, and finally ending up without a master, like willow branches broken in the spring breeze. Its intention and material are commendable. However, the facts are too clever and too hypocritical, with places where it is impossible for the facts to be,</p>
<p>The expressions are very stiff. Sang Xiuying, who plays the creditor, is simply acting like a puppet of the director. However, Chao Langen, although a comical supporting character, is still commendable. The language is also far-fetched. Except for Yang Naimei, they all curl their tongues and speak stiffly. The setting for the graduation ceremony at the university is also too simple.</p>
<p>Finally, regarding the pronunciation issue, because this is the result of preference, we cannot be satisfied with this and hope that Mr. Zhu Qingxian will continue to work hard and eventually surpass imported products.</p>
<h3 id="e316">My Criticism of "Torrent" <a href="#e316" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c316" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">316</a></h3>
<p>— Hong</p>
<p>The sensational "Torrent" has finally met with us. It uses a realistic theme, using the great floods in various provinces of China in the previous year as the background of the depiction, writing about the oppression of the peasant masses and the evils of the local bullies. However, we feel that the screenwriter has forcibly inserted such a love story into "Torrent," which is really unnecessary. Because in this way, not only does it reduce the power of "Torrent," but it also makes people doubt the reality of this story.</p>
<p>Although the director used many new techniques in "Torrent," it is a pity that he quietly let go of several places that should have been heavily depicted; although the scenes of the flood were edited very well, there were still too many. The interlude of the dance hall seems a bit like adding legs to a snake.</p>
<p>Among the characters in "Torrent," Gong Jianong's Liu Tiesheng is successful. Xia Peizhen's Suzhen, only when she tells Fu Xiujuan the story of Liu Tiesheng taking her in, are a few of the shots done best. Hu Die's Fu Xiujuan is very good in the first half, but the expressions in the second half are a bit too much. Wang Xianzai's Li Heqing, although not as fiery as Tan Zhiyuan's Fu Boren, is still very good.</p>

<p>— Zhao Peng</p>
<p>Japanese film companies are all subsidized with huge sums of money by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The films they shoot are like the following types: (1) Films that show the dignity of the nation, such as Japanese air force teams, Japanese marines, naval warships, naval exercises, etc. These all show the strength and majesty of their country. (2) Films of civil life, such as Japanese current industrial factories, education, sports, etc., all show the development of various industries in their country. (3) International films. These films are the most hateful. They sent many photographers to China, secretly filming the scenery and terrain of various places. They deliberately hired many actors to play out many internal war situations in China, and compiled them into English and French! They were sent to countries around the world, implying that China is an unorganized country. When the League of Nations investigation team passed through Japan, they specially filmed many films of Japanese civil and military officials receiving the investigation team, so that various countries showed considerable goodwill towards them. Other projects such as the Manchurian state, they have all filmed and broadcast to various countries. In addition to the above types of films, films about love, society, news, etc., must undergo strict inspection and banning by government agencies.

<p>— Xin</p>
<p>The global recession may be the main reason why American movies cannot create new box office records. Since the record of "Cavalcade" at the Roxy was established, it has been proudly unshaken for two years, until recently, when it was broken by "State Fair." "State Fair" is a film that Fox has painstakingly produced for a year, because MGM filmed "Grand Hotel" and it caused a sensation. So Fox also gathered all the famous stars of the company, such as Janet Gaynor and Will Rogers, and spent 1.5 million dollars to make a better film. Now their goal has been achieved. The box office of "State Fair" in the first five days of its initial release reached 115,822 people, exceeding the record of "Cavalcade" by more than 5,000 people.</p>

<p>Seeing that Lianhua Company has published "Lianhua Pictorial," in order not to fall behind and to expand publicity, Mingxing Company will issue a "Mingxing Monthly" at the beginning of next month. Currently, articles are being solicited from male and female stars and employees of the company.</p>

<p>— Luo Xiu</p>
<p>Nils Asther recently had a dispute with his wife Vivian Duncan over the future custody of their beloved daughter, which led to a lawsuit in court and a divorce was declared. However, the result was a victory for Vivian, who obtained custody of the girl.</p>
<p>Having failed, Niels followed in Charlie Chaplin's footsteps and asked the court to amend two points. First, the child may not leave Los Angeles without the permission of the parents and the court. Second, the child may not be involved in the film industry or on stage until the age of thirteen.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, both of these requests were rejected by the judge for trial.</p>

<h3 id="e322">Rasputin (10) <a href="#e322" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c322" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">322</a></h3>
<p>— Shi</p>
<p>She understood - all hope was extinguished. Suddenly, Neitaga walked into the room, whispering quietly, and said to her: "Your Majesty, God will never let him die!"</p>
<p>The Queen held her hand, begging: "Neitaga, please say it again! Only you give me hope!"</p>
<p>Neitaga held her for a moment, then whispered:</p>
<p>"Your Majesty, I have invited Rasputin… He is waiting outside. He can save him.”</p>
<p>“Rasputin!" The name was uttered in a quivering gasp. Even the Queen had heard the rebellious reports about this man and was afraid. But now, nothing else mattered. "Bring him in quickly," she said softly:</p>
<p>"Let me pray for the little prince." Rasputin said as he walked in, and the Queen felt all hope had vanished again.</p>
<p>"Clergymen all over the country are praying - none can save him!" She protested.</p>
<p>"I am not a clergyman, girl," Rasputin said solemnly: "I am an ordinary man, a man who believes deeply that God will answer your sincere request."</p>
<p>"We are grateful for anyone's prayers..." The Queen smiled bitterly, her hand making a gesture to ask him to leave. "Please go to the church to pray. They are all over there."</p>
<p>"God is not only in the church," Rasputin said slowly: "The sincere request of an ordinary man can move God more than all the hymns and recitations in the world. Only if you truly believe!"</p>
<p>"I truly believe!" The Queen said urgently: The mysterious power of this man had touched her.</p>
<p>"You do not truly believe, otherwise your hand would not be trembling like this!" Rasputin smiled benevolently. "And your tears would not be so contained in your eyes… If you truly believed like a child, then you would say: My son will be healed, because you are sent by God.”</p>
<p>"You are sent by God," the Queen said slowly, following his words:</p>
<p>"Now I will go see him," Rasputin suddenly became very mysterious: his arm raised, his voice becoming joyous. "Your son will live," he shouted.</p>
<p>"My son will live…" The Queen seemed to have been entranced by him, and walked along, shouting.</p>
