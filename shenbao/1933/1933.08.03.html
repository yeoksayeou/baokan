<h3>不可忽視之川患</h3>
<p>信。</p>
<p>四川自鄧劉發生衝突。　兵於崇灌間後以交通阻隔。消息不明。然此一問題。早已引起全國人民之注意。但仍無以止鄧劉之爭。且在此弭戰聲中。又加入劉湘。而成爲二劉二次之爭鬥。惟二劉此次之爭。與前次略有不同。前次之戰爲爭川中盟主。爭自流井鹽税爭下川南一帶之肥美防地。今則劉文輝非特無盟主之力。亦無主盟之心。意惟在圖暫時生存略略開拓地盤而已故首先向實力較弱内部渙散之鄧錫侯挑戰。不意鄧軍尙能强勉支持。劉文輝軍不能迅速奏效。於是影響牽...連。而四川混戰之局。乃一發而不能收拾。</p>
<p>此事之最可憂慮者。爲竄逃於川陜間之共匪不僅潛伏城市。暗布農村。作種種下層之運動。且已公然縱兵掠奪致通江南江巴中等縣。相繼失陷。而川省中下級社會。爲捐税所壓迫受兵役之騷擾。即易爲共黨所誘惑。盲目相從者。比比皆是。故以彼窮促無聊之部衆。乃得縱横千里搶州奪縣而無所忌憚也川省據地自豪之徒。素常僅有土皇帝思想。惟知竊據弄兵。於民。本無絲毫關係。剿共之説。宣騰已久。其初共匪竄踞。僅在川省極北彈九之地。彼軍閥不從事於淸剿而反挾爲多加捐税之機會。殊不料共黨即乘此逐漸蔓延。</p>
<p>迄今田頌堯一部分兵力。竟有難與抵抗之勢。不得不在此戰雲瀰漫中。唱聯合圍剿之説矣。</p>
<p>吾人根據四川過去之歷史默察當前糾紛之形勢。設使中樞無嚴厲之督促。人民無一致堅决之表示。則川局前途。殊未可樂觀也。第一。四川之防區制。爲時已久在今日之川閥。視其屬下之土地。已同於古代之封域。糧税捐卡。各自設制。財政行政。亦各獨立。現時七雄對立之局。劉存厚雖侷處一隅。但尙可運用其省内外交。勉强圖存。鄧錫侯經此次戰爭而後。質力已弱。田頌堯猶不如鄧。楊森之力。且在鄧田下。劉文輝擁兵十萬尙堪一戰。不過經二劉與劉鄧兩次交戰後。力量亦不如前。現惟有劉湘兵精械利。據富庶之區。握交通之便。大有指揮如意領袖羣雄之概然欲其統一四川以餘力掃盪匪禍。則亦無此希望也。第二人民對川閥。怨毒已深。中屬分子。雖甚憎惡黨。欲保持固有之秩序。然對川閥之過分剥削。軍隊之到處滋擾。亦無好感。至於失業之農民。流浪之苦力。原無一定之依歸。佔山爲寇，聚衆行兇。自古有之。彼又缺之相當之辦别知識。更何愛惜於國家。準此形勢。民怨愈積於内。而川局愈不可問矣。第三。緊隣川北之陜甘兩省。一則旱災奇重。二十六縣之人民。並靑草樹皮。亦不得食。挺而走險之舉。難保不影響於川境。次則鄂西大患。現方平服。地方秩序。尙未完全恢復。而殘匪根株。尤未盡絶。且賀段之流。又熟悉川邊情况。其侵擾川境。亦堪憂慮。　　有此三端。以如此複雜之軍隊剿匪。已恐其難於勝任。况今日之剿匪問題。非僅僅單純的軍事勝利。即可秦效。且須於政治上能得適當之解决。國民經濟有穩定之可能。社會安寗。有建立之希望。而後剿匪乃得而成功也。今日四川之内部若此。若欲起而收拾。必中央有整個的政治計劃。先解决川局之畸形狀態。遏止川軍閥之暴行。然後指派軍事大員。統率彼散漫之衆。馴奏剿撫之功川局庶乎其有望歟。</p>

<p>徐家匯天文台消息、本埠適當一猛烈大颶風之衝、其中心方吹過東海、向西北方徐徐進行、距滬不過三百哩、苟非突遇高壓、使颶風臨時變更方向、則本埠恐將難逃暴風之厄、惟觀察昨晨氣象、此種高壓一時尙無降臨之象、故該台業已發廣播無缐電、警告海上及港内船舶戒備風力十度之猛烈旋風雨、此項旋風雨、蓋爲颶風之先驅、至颶風過境期、尙不能預先斷定、或者其中心將在星期五抵滬、昨日、本埠所遇風向屢變之大風、即係颶所產生、故上海業已入於颶風區域、即昨日揚子江口之風浪交作‘雷電乍現、亦係颶風之先聲、蓋此次颶風、勢殊猛烈、設其中心逕襲滬埠、恐船舶與陸地所受損失、當不在小也、</p>

<p>立法院長孫科、前應汪蔣電召、參與廬山會議、茲已公畢、昨晨八時由京乘夜快車返滬、各報社記者、昨日上午、訪晤之、於寓次、據孫談稱、察事决不用武力解决、廬會侮討論軍政各問題、未及外交云、昨晨十時五十分、孫氏驅車訪李烈鈞談半小時、始行辭出、各情分誌如次、</p>
<h3>廬會内容</h3>
<p>孫氏昨晨於接見記者時首稱、此次廬山會議、未談及外交問題、所討論之範圍、爲政治諸重要問題、及軍事技術問題、關於政治者、如新疆事變之善後、已擬有確定辦法、且該省新委亦經行政院通過、至察事之解决辦法、已詳見汪蔣聯名之儉電、至其他諸點、亦經汪蔣商妥辦法、</p>
<h3>貫澈和平</h3>
<p>在廬山會議前、中央曾採軍事行動、向察省推進、促宋哲元返任、接收察省行政、但各對此、均方和平、用政治方法解决、中央爲免釀成以抗日始内亂終、决定採納此項意見、暫停軍事行動、今廬會已定有原則、馮如同意、再進行商結束軍事辦法、如地方善後、及部隊之安插諸問題、中央軍之入察、并非不滿馮氏抗日、因察哈爾爲中央省區、中央軍隊之推進、接收察省行政、統一軍權、自不受任何限制也、至收復四省失地、决非以察省一隅之力所能任、必充實全國力量、一致行動、始有此望、</p>

<p>事、古來已數見不鮮·至於傳新疆將劃分三省云云、據本人所知、新省面積較大於東此三省、雖有分省而治要、但地廣人稀、居民僅二百萬、若實行分省、則財力不及、勢必　增加人民負擔、故一時難以實現、</p>

<h3>訪李烈鈞</h3>

<h3>芝加哥當局唱西廂記</h3>
<p>— 瞻廬</p>
<p>只道今年「天開裸運」，誰知又到處受着挫折、香港沙田的裸運，大大的不景氣，頗有「王小二過年，一年不如一年」的景象；其他·哈爾濱裸運，上海裸運，也不能得到社會上熱烈的歡迎。大多數的人説：「羞惡之心，人皆有之，衣冠文物之邦，本不該有此怪現象。」但是醉</p>
<p>心裸運者，都在頻頻太息地説：「倮蟲三百六十，人爲之長，見於孔氏家語，人爲倮蟲，何用深諱。一披上衣冠，便把人　　蔽了；提倡裸運，不但，有益身體，而且，可以恢復固有的人格，爲什麽要反對呢？」　　新大陸人民的思想，當然新於舊大陸人民了，「不掛一絲」的主義，不能行於舊大陸，合該行於新大陸了；然而，事實上却不然。芝加哥地方，有人發起在某公園，圈地一方，四周設立木栅，俾容裸體者萬人在内作日光浴。但，芝加哥當局對於這木栅條陳，嚴行拒絶。事後告訴人，很帶些，幽默論調；他説·「木栅作園牆，依舊有被人窺浴的可能；若要斷絶窺浴，除非木栅高與天齊。」咦！芝加哥當局竟唱起西廂記來了。　　張生釘着　　的梢，「只有那一步遠，」　　人内去了，張生望不見伊，便唱一句「粉牆兒高似靑天。」粉牆兒任　築的高，總不能高似靑天，張生未免過甚其詞吧；不料芝加哥當局也有這般理想，假使築起了天一般高的木栅，那便呌做「木栅兒高似靑天」了。有了這插天的木栅，許多美國張生見了，不要唱着：「望將穿，涎空嚥」麽？</p>
<p>裸運不能盛行，便是爲着有一垜高與天齊的無形牆垣在那裏做屏障。這牆垣呌什</p>
<p>麽？呌做「羞惡之牆」。打不倒這「羞惡之牆」，那麽倮「蟲世界」便無實現的可能；看來「</p>
<p>「天開運動」的日子，不是旦夕間的事吧，醉心裸運者，快快收拾起「一絲不掛」的主義，待過數年或</p>
<p>十年，再作主張吧。�</p>
<h3>小城池的夏夜</h3>
<p>— 耘殮</p>
<p>都市的夏夜，給玩筆竿兒的同志們，淋漓盡致的寫得太多了；農村的夏夜，我没福享受；雖然暫避了都市的　囂，而低能的都市縮影，依然掩映到眼簾；小城池城隍廟有露天的電影塲，有電燈·有小遊戲；縣黨部要給民衆們明瞭東北抗日血戰的悲烈慘狀！運到幾部軍事影片，没有戲院，便假城隍廟露天開映，廣大無邊的天井，居然滿坑滿谷，男男女女，大開眼界；總算給他們瞧過一回「影戲」了，至於抗日不抗日？並不在話下，所以這般擁擠，據説：第一是不化錢看白戲，第二是見到如許的神秘「活鬼影」，認爲生活史開了新紀元；月夜裏的揚州班，也是唯一消遣的所在，揚州班又敎做「邵伯童子」；江南人稱蘇州話敎吳儂軟語，江北人便把揚州話當做首選，這邵伯戲，就打着揚州話，唱彈詞式的戲詞，一樣有人伴黄臉婆子，帶夜點心，作盡夜的歡娛；可是給老頭兒老婆子聞風知曉，要抿着嘴，搖着頭，當做新聞談個不了咧。</p>
<p>兵崩，兵崩，兵兵崩，這是賣「道情」沿街期待顧客的一個暗示，滴搭，滴搭，又是一種「敲盤子」的賣歌者，再有一種江湖賣藝的敎做「間壁戲」，「唱道情」和「敲盤子」，是比較高等些的乞丐，他們不沿門討化；捲着腿兒揎起膀臂納凉的人們，聽到這類聲調，便有好事者挺身出來做發起人，某一種的賣藝者，自然很歡欣地高着嗓子唱他的拿手傑作，一曲甫終，發起人便向圍滿的聽衆，高聲喊着：「衆人帮一人」，請觀衆慷慨解囊，各掏出一二枚銅元，老年人聽到兒孫也學哼着道情調兒，立刻便要下令道：「道情學不得」，學會了二十二月，就逃不了要走一回江湖，據説這是相沿下來的一句治家格言，敲盤子賣唱，似乎只盛行内河輪船上，唯有這間壁戲，的確是一種口技，頗具藝術的風趣，王　子賣膏藥，李瞎子磨荳腐，最博聽衆的擊賞，能仿南腔北調，能肖雞鳴犬吠；可惜兵崩兵崩，滴搭滴搭的聲調，在納凉的人們聽了儼然是五音連彈，十樂齊秦，能引起無限的歡娛：其實不過鴉片紅丸！在那兒掙扎出來的一些呐喊罷了。</p>
<h3>蜜蜂的刺</h3>
<p>— 醉痴生</p>
<p>開設一家「電影院」；其感動人們的效力，比開設一個「學堂」來得大。</p>
<p>「交易所」與「跳舞塲」，「看似不相關，却有幾分相　。交易所是迷於「金錢，」跳舞塲是迷於「肉感。」</p>
<p>男女是永遠不會平等的；女人赤了脚，説是「摩登，」是「時髦。」男子赤了脚，便説是「下流社會，」是「赤脚人。」</p>
<p>床帳裏有一個「蚊子，」褲子裏有一個「蚤虱，」可以使你通宵不眠。社會上有個「不良份子，」其破壞秩序與安甯，爲害正是一樣。</p>
<p>社會有兩種自殺的人：一種是有形的自殺，一種是無形的自殺。有形的自殺，可以用急救法。無形的自殺，實在無藥可治。</p>
<p>要實現「世界大同，人類平等，」的眞諦，惟有提倡「裸體運動。」　　船上的江北人，倒是主張「裸體運動」最力之人。你看他們的「小三子，」「小鴨子」，都是整日的赤裸裸一絲不掛，很自然的跳躍着。</p>
<h3>談談上海的公寓</h3>
<p>— 瘦鷗</p>
<p>衣食住行，雖説是人生四大要素，缺一件就不能過日子，然而生活費用像這樣無限制的增加上去，人們要維持這四件東西，委實不是容易的事情。尤其是在上海，在上海尤其是住的問題更難。</p>
<p>我在上海已住了整整的十個年頭了，搬來搬去，雖是總因獨自一家租一幢屋子的緣故，未管受過什麽二房東的氣，可是環境總還不曾跳出弄堂，旣在弄堂之内，四周少不得就有許多高鄰，這些高鄰都不是你自已所能選擇的，於是往往會碰到澈夜開無線電音樂鑑賞家，和那些叉麻雀夜夜非叉到天亮不可的好賭先生。弄得你欲生不能，欲死不可，結果祇能另行高遷，偏是遷居又是一椿最麻煩的事情。那未，惟有硬着頭皮挺下去啦！</p>
<p>最近，我又逢到了這樣尷𠆷的局面，�</p>
<p>想之再三，無法解决，後來，我就决意一個人去住公寓。公寓在上海，大約可分爲兩種。一種是旅舘式的，男女可以同住；一種是宿舍式的，專收孤男寡女，連異性的訪問，也是限制得很嚴格的，可是淸靜却淸靜得多了。這種宿舍式的公寓，據我所知道，在上海有四處。一處是靑年會，一處是儉德會，一處是四行儲蓄會所辦的虹口公寓，還有一處是中國銀行虹口分行樓上。這四處中，創辦最早的是靑年會，房價最廉的是儉德會，房屋最考究，價錢最貴的是中國銀行。虹口公寓是介乎三者之中，一切設備和定價，都和水平線一樣的平。於是我就遷進了虹口公寓，準備渡過一個夏天再走。</p>
<p>這四家公寓的章程，我都看過，他人對於寓客的批評，都有盡量容納的表示。據我看來，别的也還無關緊要，倒是夏天不備蓆子，敎中國寓客也學着外國人一般的睡很厚的Ｓheet，似乎太洋化了。這一點我很願他們的管理人加以注意。）儉德公寓備有蓆子（</p>
<h3>東北四連長</h3>

<p>第十二回　寒賤苦從戎病夫落伍　犧牲甘解甲戰士多情</p>
<p>將來説成了，也許辦喜事的那天，他也抽不開身來呢，那不是一件笑話嗎？好在這兩天，他們趙家人也没有來提起婚事，麻麻糊糊的，能混一天，就混一天，混到了十天半個月，我老不開口，趙家也許知道我們是不樂意，那麽，以後他就不會提了。江氏想了這樣一個笨主意，自第二日起，不但是不肯作一點表示，而且也不大向後面院子裏去。頭兩三日，趙翁還不介意，到了一個星期之久，趙翁知道事情不妙了。這天趙自强回來，趙翁只告訴他，楊家没有提到婚事，過兩天再説也不要緊。趙自强也不疑到事情有變坦然的回營去了。，</p>
<p>過了兩天，他再回來，趙翁口裏啣了旱煙袋，躺在睡椅上，只管抽着，許久，才道：楊老太的意思，我是看出來了，他覺的你是個軍人，不能常在家裏待着的。他只這個姑娘，他總望姑爺常常在眼面前。你有公事在身的人，這怎樣能辦的到，所以他很淡淡的。趙自强在這半個月之中，本來十分的厭倦軍人生活，聽説楊家姑娘，不願許配軍人，不但不嫌楊家反悔，而且覺得人家這態度是應當的。於是低了頭在他父親對面椅子上坐着，半天没有作聲。趙翁嘴裏啣了煙袋咀子，吧吸吧吸抽着煙響。許久，他才道：你看這件事怎麽樣？攀親戚總要兩方面願意，一點也勉强不得。現在楊家老太太和他姑娘都不願意，我們勉强着人家的意思來凑合成功，到了將來，那要是大家不順心的，這又何必呢？趙自强依然是低了頭坐着，説不出他心裏所要説的那番話。很久的時候，他半昂着頭，却歎了一口氣。）一四七（</p>
<p>逰踪所至</p>
<h3>鄕村一日記</h3>
<p>— 張一蘋</p>
<p>太陽剛從東方探起頭來，我們的小船已搖了一陣路。表弟在船首撑篙，我在船尾搖橹，望着那鏡也似的河面，被小船的前進打的破碎：同時太陽光的倒影，像無數的金蛇要湧出水面來。</p>
<p>爲了昨晚乘凉時的一句戲語，今天絶早表弟堅决租了一條船到鄉下去。其實在船上的兩個，都不熟水路，更不知村和鎭的所在，我們僅沿着官河，一篙一橹的前進。漸漸地與城牆隔離，兩岸儘是倒塌的牛棚，或者有幾椽茅舍，像油盡中一般靜靜地安放在那裡：前面是靑的天，和水面接連在一處。難得有上城的鄉人走過，就是在橋頭田岸間的草狗，也倦了似的躺着。這裡是安寗，悠間，我們停止了工作，各自在船首船尾坐地，船隨着上潮把兩岸送向後面去。一條來往城裡的脚划船，趕過我們前面，它們張着巨大的篷，像奔上天去一樣。</p>
<p>「順風順水哩！」船首的開口。</p>
<p>我没有回答。我注視着一個走近前來的鄉人。我在船後站起身來，放大了聲音喊：「噲，請問一聲，這裡是什麽所在？」</p>
<p>那鄉下人像受驚似的趕前幾步，我也看淸了他的面目，是我家墳上的管門人。</p>
<p>「阿發，連我家的墳不遠了嗎？」我假聰明的問。</p>
<p>「哈，少爺，下鄉有什麽事？上墳要在那邊收港的。」他説着向我們後面一指「前邊是六橋灣，我剛從家裡出來。」</p>
<p>「好，就到阿發家去吧！」船首的表弟喊了起來。</p>
<p>於是阿發下了船，轉進了一條小河，就望見了一個小小的村落，我們的船停在六橋灣的小橋邊。這時太陽已正中，鄉下人早已吃過飯，許多赤了上下身的孩子，都圍在橋邊，一個小的孩子喊出外國人來了。</p>
<p>阿發的妻子殷勤地送上兩盆面水，我們洗過了身，把船上帶來的食糧，都搬上橋頭的牛棚。裸着上身，抬起了脚，狼呑虎嚥地吃一個飽，把餘多下來的分給圍攏來的孩子。</p>
<p>一陣陣的風從四面送來，或將不信酷毒的太陽曬在我們頂上。田中的稻，已有半人那未高，隨着風東披四倒，好似怪好看的浪花。「就是在這裡坐一天一晚，也不虚此一行了。」我想。</p>
<p>阿發説：「六橋灣」一共二十多家人家，城裡來的脚划船也在這裡停一停的，所以這鎭也很出名，前面的茶舘，就是爲了附近各鎭乘船的人而設的。」他指着那最高的樓。</p>
<p>當然，如發現了名勝古蹟一般，我們穿着了衣服到那茶舘去觀光；踏上樓梯，幾乎把喝茶的鄉下人嚇呆了，因爲我們穿着四裝，阿發忙搶在前面説：「老虎，城裡的少爺啦，泡壺淡的。」</p>
<p>被呌做老虎的忙拖過條抺布，把桌子凳子都擦了個乾凈，給我們節了兩杯茶，就立在一邊。</p>
<p>靠着窗口，面前儘是半人高的稻田，一條河像枝枒似的横在正中，河面最闊的大概是官道了，我對表弟説：「來時怎不見小港呢？」自已都覺得好笑起來。</p>
<p>兩個坐在船頭，望着暮色籠罩了大地，明月掛在頭頂，像催眠一般地歸來。</p>

<h3>靑年與服用國貨</h3>
<p>— 仰葊</p>
<p>項康原君，爲提倡國貨之實行家，思想極敏’而行事尤果敢‘嘗謂養成國民服用國貨習慣’當始自學校，而小學敎師責任，更爲重大。從死的敎育，變杨活的敎育，從消極的節約，變爲積極的科學的消費，實爲今日最重要之工作。如果不從根本着想，則國貨事業，只有來路，没有出路，將見愈提倡而使資金愈呆，此種不是正本淸源之道，前途極多危險，環顧全國比較見識高，眼光遠，而最具愛國思想者，當以敎育家爲首屈一指，負有訓練全國靑年子弟，使人人有服用國貨習慣者，當然非敎育家不可。苟如目下情形，人人以舒服美觀爲事，衣食住行，大有非用舶來品不可之意，則敎育愈發達，國貨界厄運愈多，敎育之結果，功歟，罪歟，可深長思也。項君旣以一元救國之議，正在積極計畫，最近在中華國貨產銷合作恊會，根據所有主張，提出靑年服用國貨奬勵會之辦法，並謂如果各方贊同，實行此舉，假定以十萬元爲標準，項君願以子女敎育基金五千元加入爲之倡。熱心毅力，在座同人，俱爲動容。其辦法之大概，略爲紹介如左·</p>
<p>）旨趣（養成各級學校學生服用國貨習慣，爲提倡國貨之最澈底辦法。</p>
<p>）二（證明自小學以迄大學各級學生，無論應任何考試，須憑學校校長，出具確係服用國貨之證明書，方得應試。</p>
<p>）三（奬學金規定奬勵優良學生學額·）一（小學三百名，）二（中學一百名，）三（大學三十名。</p>
<p>）四（任用各廠需用人才，及職業介紹所推蒍人才，均就此項考取得奬之學生，儘先任用。此外各廠各公司毎年所用之練習生，亦均就此項學生中選拔。</p>
<p>）五（合作社廣設消費合作社，在各地各校都有同樣消費合作社之組織。所售貨物須嚴加審查，悉屬眞正國產</p>
<p>）六（經費先行籌集基金，即以利息爲本會經費。並商得熱心國貨工廠之同意·以純益金百分之二爲本會基金，以便逐漸推廣，事業日以擴大。此項辦法，極爲切要，極有效力，希望敎育家實業家共同商榷，折衷至當，力贊其成，以求早日成爲事實，亦國貨年中，値行紀念之一事也。</p>
<p>國貨談話</p>
<h3>結緍的快樂</h3>
<p>— 詩典</p>
<p>結緍是人生最快樂的一回事。</p>
<p>「洞房花燭夜，一宵値千金。」自稱</p>
<p>爲道學先生的古代人。尙且有這種風流的思想和行動；我們現代人當然不能例外。所以，未緍的童男，一到婚期將近，便歡呼雀躍心馬意猿，天天盻望佳期之到臨；未嫁的處女，逢到嫁的時候，外表上似乎很沉靜，羞人答答，但她底内心的愉快而熱烈地期待着，自然也不容否認的。</p>
<p>緍期將屆，雙方的家長，喜悦若狂。男邊忙着置備簇新的家具什物，女邊忙着豐厚的嫁妝。這大概是有兩種意義：一方面是爲着父母愛護兒女情切，乘此所謂大喜的機會，多買些東西給他她們，作爲慈親的紀念。他方面是包蘊着希望他她們結合後，能夠多獨立生活的寓意。</p>
<p>這是一回値得頌贊的舉動。但結婚之能否永允享受快樂的大問題，却就在這一回値得頌贊的舉動上。</p>
<p>原因是這：我國人大半有一種傳統的崇拜外貨習，認爲外貨總是美麗的，耐用的，可靠的。因此。在採辦嫁妝時，便不惜重價去搜羅　　外貨　尤其是那所謂價廉物美，輕巧耐用的東洋貨，吏爲他們所歡迎。同時，我國人的。習慣，結緍的嫁妝豐厚不豐厚，認爲有關家庭名譽。往往盡耗家中所有之財，甚至出重利向人借錢以購備，亦所不惜，所以，這筆給外人賺去的金錢，煞中大呵！</p>
<p>外國人賺着這筆大欵子，决不感謝我們；反而把這錢去整軍經武，打進我們在國來。現在日本人掠奪我們東三省，熱河，威迫我們平津，便是鐵一般的事實表現。</p>
<p>敵人鐵騎一天天的進迫過來，説不定我們馬上會做亡國奴。亡國奴便永不會再享受到結婚的快樂了。這裏我先把事實來做證明：</p>
<p>［韓國男女，不到四十五歲，不准結婚，結婚之前，第一步先買緍書，價値百元，第二步買到婚書後，再調查本人職業，如無職業，仍不得結緍，第三步有職業而不通日語者，須學習三年，查該男女有志氣有精神，則雖三年期滿亦難卒業，必續讀三年。］</p>
<p>根據五月九日新聞報—</p>
<p>這樣的結緍，煞是活受罪！尙何「快樂」之可言！</p>
<p>現在我們應該乘這敵人鐵騎還没有踐踏到本身頭上來的最後五分鐘，快快用國貨，制敵人以經濟上的死命，還可以繼續大享受「結緍的快樂」。</p>
<p>否則，敵人鐵騎一到，我們怕不會和韓國人一設，馬上要「結緍的。不快樂」了嗎！</p>
<p>住在現實象牙之塔裏的醉死萝生人們呵！現在是我們覺　的最後機會了。</p>
<p>這是我願意的提出兩點中心的主張出來，買獻給大衆，以維護我們中華民族之永恒的「結婚的快樂」。</p>
<p>）一（未結婚的童男處女，要享受「結婚的快樂」，應該快快用國貨！</p>
<p>）二（結婚的紳士老爺少奶奶老婆婆們，希望子子孫孫享受「結婚的快樂」，應該快快用國貨！</p>
<p>國貨討論</p>
<h3>推銷國貨到鄉村去？</h3>
<p>已經有大半年不回家了，這次回鄉的六七天，所給我印象，祇是悲觀；别的且不談，單就國貨一項來説吧！眞是可怕得很，他們不知道什麽呌「國貨」？要他們去應用「國貨」，當然更談不到了；在他們遲鈍而蠢愚的腦筋裏，祇有「洋貨」「來路貨」「外國貨」「西洋」「東洋」…等的名字，在鄉村裏除了農產土貨外，到處充斥着洋貨；就是有少量的國貨，他們也目爲洋貨，説來又好笑，又好氣；當然不能怪他們，這是敎育程度的關係。</p>
<p>有人説；洋貨的推銷員，是都市裏的摩登的女子，和靑年，販賣洋貨的又是都市裏的商人，所以要推銷國貨須在都市裏，因此國貨展覽會也就都開幕在都市裏，我並不是反對這樣做去，不過我們要知道，這是互爲困果的，國貨愈不到鄉村裏去，就愈同鄉人隔膜，得到鄉人的信仰也愈渺，愛用的人也愈少；而給洋貨侵入的機會就愈多，鄉人也隨着愈信洋貨而不信任國貨，這樣循環的互爲因果，所以國貨速宜推銷到鄉村裏去，打破這個循環的因果。</p>
<p>我們把眼光放大些看來，我國是向來以農立國的，在四萬萬的同胞中，有三萬萬四千萬是農人，再加上幾百萬的小工小商人，合占全國人民百分之八十五以上，以平均每人用洋貨一角，不是有幾千萬錢要流到國外去嗎？再以此數和都市裏流去的洋貨錢來比較，看到底孰多孰少？我們爲挽回從鄉村裏流去的幾千百萬元起見，也须把國貨推銷到鄉村去。</p>
<p>推銷國貨到鄉村去！</p>
<p>國貨介紹</p>
<h3>介紹國貨脚踏車</h3>
<p>— 宜菊</p>
<p>脚踏車一物，我國極少自製，大抵由國外輸入，近年來吾國内地交通，日臻便利，脚踏車之需要，亦因之而增加，故每年外貨脚踏車輛之輸入，爲數甚大，惟國人鮮有加以注意者，此非計之得也。</p>
<p>虹口密勒路大興車行，爲首先製造國貨脚踏車之公司，自問世以來，頗得國内人士之贊美，故其銷路，亦甚優勝，深盼各界人士，有以注意之。</p>
<p>該廠自造最新式之行李車，聞能母需傢具，可自由裝卸，置於方不及三英尺之箱盒中，舟車携帶，頗爲便利，誠爲國貨脚踏車之新發明也。</p>
<h3>雜感</h3>
<p>— 添影</p>
<p>一（提倡國貨與洋文）</p>
<p>吾眞不懂，爲什麽中國人信仰外人的心理是這樣的深刻？凡事都以帶幾分洋氣爲榮顯。你看；國貨公司，國貨商埸，國貨ＸＸ…，其中的貨物，當然是十足的國產品，但是很多的出品上的商標，廠名，廠址，連説明紙上的使用法等，完全用着洋文；即使有幾個漢字，也只在遮隱的匣背，匣底或貨物的内層：若不是陳列在「國貨ＸＸ」之中的話，大有榮）？（冠「來路貨」的資格，難道非這樣國貨不足以提倡嗎？</p>
<p>）二（提倡國貨與廣告）</p>
<p>提倡國貨的高調，唱着已有很久的歷史了，但是回顧各國貨工廠出品的銷路，遠不如外貨來得廣且速，這原由當然很是複雜；其中「廣告」之於出品的銷路，可説占着很重要的力量。倘若有一件新出品，不用廣告來宣傳，民間根本就不知道有這樣東西的存在，雖然牠使用便利，又很經濟，有誰來注意呢？作者希望名國貨工廠，莫惜區區的廣告費，而應響及國貨的銷路！（作者並非爲報舘兜攬生意）</p>
<p>）三（提倡國貨與裝璜）</p>
<p>裝璜之於出品，猶如衣衫之於人，雖然只是一種浮表的形式，好像於實際無關；但是，譬如一個上等的商買，穿了檻褸的衣衫，雖然他爲人誠實可靠，不會有人信任他的。貨品也是一樣的要外表，俗語説「買相」，没有「買相」，任你的貨品質高價廉，也不會受人歡迎。</p>
<p>國貨中對於裝璜不注意的很多，因裝璜不良而應響及貨品銷路的，實不在少數！</p>
<p>四（提倡國貨與抵貨）</p>
<p>要使國貨能暢銷，抵貨也是一種消極的辦法。但是加顧過去的抵貨成績，眞要令人昨舌。抵貨原是要各廠商自動的實行·因爲顧客很容易爲「改頭換面」的欺騙。目今旣然仍有喪心狂的奸商，乘Ｘ貨傾銷時，儘量批買，不顧國貨銷路的牽制，那麽除了各國貨廠「改良出品」，「薄利多銷」之外，竟無法與之抗爭了。</p>
<p>總而言之，提倡國貨，並非單靠顧客來提倡，各廠商都應該用相當的方法，使自已的貨品，能受一般人的歡迎，而樂意購用！</p>
<h3>綢緞的風光</h3>
<p>— 劉曾慰</p>
<p>我國自古以來，穿綢着緞，是認爲出風頭的事，綢緞的生意，當然也不壞。不料海禁開通之後，外國貨源源而來，我國綢緞一業亦給外國的怎樣紗怎樣縐打倒了。於是乎一匹一匹的綢緞無人顧問，只得冷淸淸的在櫉窗裏挨日子。　　綢緞的主人，眼見生意不興，不禁着急起來。因此，着意改良，把那綢緞大加修飾，顏色暗淡的，使它鮮明。花樣難看的，使它雅緻。費了一番苦心之後，比外國貨的怎樣紗，怎樣縐，也不見多讓了。</p>
<p>主人又高興起來，把那些改良的綢緞，陳列出來，開了一個展覽會。屆時，來了許多士女，大家來觀光。那些綢緞，也鮮艷奪目，出了一番風頭，而那來賓的讚美，似乎更使那綢緞美觀起來，大可超外國的怎麽怎麽而上之了。</p>
<p>那展覽的數天，的確熱鬧非凡。但這不過一時的熱鬧，我們提倡綢緞，决不是就止於此了。我們極誠懇的希望，從此以後，提倡綢緞者，更要努力的提倡。而一方面，製造者，更宜努力的改良。要做到綢緞的價格，比外國貨的怎麽紗，怎麽縐廉，而品質，色澤，花樣，要比它們好。到了那時，非但綢緞色澤鮮明，美觀雅緻，大可一出風頭，並且把一種國貨實業的基礎打好，一定可以挽回利權不少呀。</p>

<h3>舊事</h3>
<p>— 小雪</p>
<p>葉夢得「石林避暑錄話」上，載了一則蝗災的故事。在旱年，如臯縣有了蝗災，鄰近的泰興縣令乃大得意，報郡將説：「我們這裡没有蝗。」不久，泰興的蝗災也起了，郡將質問縣令，縣令説，我們這裡本來没有蝗，蝗是從如臯飛來的。並且行公文到如臯，要他們「嚴捕蝗，無使侵鄰境。」這時的如臯縣令是錢穆甫，看到這一公文，忙提筆在後面寫道：　　「蝗虫本是天災，卽非縣令不才。旣自敝邑飛去，郤請貴縣押來」。　　不久，這故事德到了郡下，大家竟引爲笑談。由於宋代的蝗虫，我想到現代的老鼠。二十世紀老鼠也畢竟不同了。據上月各報所載，安徽發現大批老鼠，不但擾害田禾，而且兼食牲畜，尤奇的，是食貓食牛，甚至結隊前進，渡江而南，累得各報記者，如報告偉人起居般的，大打其專電。可是，老鼠雖然跑過了縣境，縣令彼此間竟没有起糾紛。於是、我意識的。</p>
<p>想至，現代人究竟聰明的多，知道天災不要自已負責任，也就不做相煎的優事。　　現代人雖説聰明，糊塗一時的事，也還不能避免。我知道，在齊盧之戰時，有一個笑話。在南京，司令部每天送出捷報，我軍進展若干里。戰事開始幾天以後，有一個大學生把進展的里數統計了一下，他駭得把舌頭伸了出來，因爲這進展的里數如果眞確，兩軍是正在大海洋中相戰，陸地早已進展完了。去年，在報上，讀霍邱縣令反攻縣城的公電，那縣令説，敵軍人數甚多，我軍很少；敵軍在城上，佔優勢，我軍在城下，殊難應敵，故結果是，敵軍死傷無算，我軍毫無損傷而退郤。讀此「毫無」二字，眞令人起「刀槍不入」之感。　　像這樣又聰明又糊塗的事，眞不知有多少，祇要你留心讀報，每天總可發現一些。這且放在一旁，再回到老鼠説向豺狼吧。中央社鄭州七月二十九日電，説嵩豫縣三區車村里一帶，二十五六兩日突發現大批豺狼，白晝成羣，逢人便咬，居民傷亡極多。各報很珍視這一新聞，大都把它排成一塊豆腐干的形式，外加方框，以惹起讀者注意。其實我看是大可不必的，老鼠旣已横行，豺狼怎能不當道？豺狼旣已當道矣，則「逢人便咬，居民傷亡極多，」乃是必然的事，慣常的事，又何必如此驚奇？若並此而驚奇，而必加上方的花框，那麽，毎一條新聞，如果不經嚴密的考核，將都有加框的必要，試問記者先生，各報館安得有如許花框乎？　　車若水「脚氣集」説，「偶步瓜園，見有惡蜂，捕一絡緯，上用口咬，下用毒釘，不堪其若。天地职如何得知，何所赴訟？爲之情懷不佳者數日」蜂傷絡緯，已令若水「情懐不佳者數日，」此老若生於日，我眞不知其又將如何也？無可奈何，恐怕也只能效東坡居士，「呵呵」幾聲罷！</p>
<h3>辯證法與江湖訣</h3>
<p>— 古飛</p>
<p>早幾天，看見某先生發表了關於觀察的意見，隨後他在另一篇文章裹，又説到一切的問題是觀察的方法的問題。把創作者和客觀現實間的關係僅僅简單地放在「觀察」作用上面，直截了當固然直截了當，但那已經把「辯證法」的戰鬥性洗刷得干干凈凈了。但奇怪的是，某先生一面替辯證法去勢，一面又和做金字塔詩一樣，把一些術語，如「積極性」啦，「革命的主題「啦，「契機」啦，搬到一塊·使讀的人好像跑到孔明底八卦陳裏去了一樣。</p>
<p>但我現在並不想批評他底理論，因爲在這樣小的篇幅裏做不到，而且他所批評的作品我還没有讀過。我現在想説的是史特克在「關於辯證法的卑俗化」裏所提到的一個故事。</p>
<p>有一個「辯證法的唯物論者」用「辯證法」來研究遠東的漁業經營，説「現在那還是停留在自已的『生成』生誕的初期階段裏。那還是剛剛表現出來」。於是，他從魚是用翅子運動的這件事立論，接着寫道：</p>
<p>魚—在漁區特别是解了禁的漁區裏的魚族，與其説是徹底的力學的（Dynamic)對象，還不如用哲學的言語來表現。從它所有的範疇來看，是運動的過程。漁業經濟之古典的辯證法的明確性正在這裏。　　諸位想一想，還有比這更奇怪更好玩的『辯證法』麽？但我們不要忘記，這樣的「辯證法」正在一天一天地多起來，而且還有人正想用這作口實來剷除辯證法的戰鬥任務。</p>
<p>還連想起來了一件事情。早前不久，一位朋友因爲平日好作直論，被人迫食學校當局把底敎職革掉了，他因此感到現在做人太難，没有逃避之所。想來想去，想出了一個最安全的辦法：用「辯證法」來整理中國醫學！當他告訴了我他底這個大願以後，我不禁失聲地笑了起來。他馬上正色地説，「笑什麽？爲什麽不能用辯證法來整理醫學呢？」　　是的，爲什麽不能用「辯證法」來整理醫學呢？</p>
<p>我想，也許有一天時裝公司會用「辯證法」來裁剪時裝的。</p>
<h3>見得多</h3>
<p>— 徐懋庸</p>
<p>高爾基的一個短篇「秋天的一日］」（Ｕnjour　d,automne)的法文譯本上，在題目下面，有這麽一行附註：</p>
<p>「一箇見得多的人的記述」（Ｌier,ecitd,um　homme　qui　a　beaucoup　vu)　　在好幾種中文譯本上，似乎都没有這一句。</p>
<p>「見得多」這三箇字，實在是高爾基的作品的泉源，也就是他的偉大的成因。</p>
<p>并且，這不獨於高爾基爲然，一切偉大的作家何莫不然。</p>
<p>要見得多，端頼游歷，但這是極受限制的。能夠暢快地游歷的人，只有兩種，一種是足於川資的富者，他能夠在上層社會見得多。另一種是絶無川資的Ｖagabond,　他能夠在下層社會見得多。至於小有川資的中間層，則大抵游而不能快，見而不能多。</p>
<p>最爲國人所知的蕭伯訥和高爾基，是兩種快游者的現成的例子。</p>
<p>中國的作家，多半出身於中間層。有的雖然出過洋，自以爲「行萬里路」了，但所見的也無非自已一階層内的而且限於自已身邊的人和事，其他方面，即曾見到，也不過皮毛。因此我們的文壇中，雖也有擬資產階級的文學的文學，但是往往「畫虎類狗」，只成就些「風花雪月，　戀愛，接吻」。他方面，我們的「無產階級文學」也完全是「純溫室底的」。</p>
<p>不過，我們曾有在農村見得多的幾個作家，例如魯迅，因此，我們還能有「呐喊」和「彷徨」等作品。</p>
<p>要是我們的中間層的作家，還要寫作品，而且想使他的作品有生命，那麽總得見得多些，　好在還有　　　大　資的地方可以讓你游歷，就是農村。切莫永遠自已禁錮在都會的亭子間裏。</p>
<h3>一天</h3>
<p>— 艾霞</p>
<p>一大早，被我的外甥吵醒了，在床上朦朧想到的，第一就是今天怎麽辦？昨天晚上只買了四個燒餅，算是晚餐，米是老早没有了…　　在三天前，也是米快完了的那一個晚上，所剩的米只夠煮粥，菜是全吃完了，我就問那個小的外甥菱兒：</p>
<p>「今天晚上没有菜，吃粥好不好？」</p>
<p>他不回答，表示了不顧意。</p>
<p>時常斷糧惯了的我，對此也不覺得怎樣，幾年來的漂泊生活，已經把我磨練得一點也不在乎了。</p>
<p>晚餐的桌子上是擺着一塊白醬豆腐，六個銅子的花生米，還有四碗稀稀的粥。</p>
<p>小孩子們看見桌上的花生米，很歡喜地笑了。</p>
<p>「媽呀，菱弟挑了大的花生米吃，他不吃粥</p>
<p>。」</p>
<p>［快吃吧，别鬧了。明天還不知道怎麽過呢？」</p>
<p>靑兒給弟弟告狀，反遭了他母親説，不高興地低下頭去吃粥，心裏想着媽媽老是偏心，袒護弟弟。</p>
<p>大家都靜靜的，菱兒吃完了兩碗還要添，我姐姐禁止他：</p>
<p>「别吃了吃多了晚上要起來撒尿。」</p>
<p>天生怕向人開口借錢的我，情願找了衣服去當，但是能當的衣服老早已經送進當舖了。就是我最心愛的，頂歡喜穿的那件葱綠色的旗袍，也已經在兩個月前送進當舖去，付那拖欠了兩個月，不能再欠的房租一個月。</p>
<p>第二天十點鐘，就跑到老陳那裏，希望拿一點稿費來救急。但當我想到上次他預借的稿費，出乎我意料的是同那中篇小説所應得的稿費差不多時，也就不願意開口，祇好頽喪地走了出來；雖然我知道家裏是揭開鍋蓋等著米。</p>
<p>心理煩燥，如上太陽烤在背上，熱汗順着額臉往下流，又癢又有一點疼，手不停地抺着臉上的汗，渾身直昌熱氣，脚底下的柏油路，好像有意的把鞋用力地拖住，使我的步代沉重到異樣地難以移動。一輛汽車飛也似地在我身邊馳過，把灰土全都捲起來。</p>
<p>「混賬！」</p>
<p>我不覺恨恨地駡了一聲。</p>
<p>帶着疲倦回到家裏，看見靑兒同菱兒用着希望的眼睛望着我，使我很難過。</p>
<p>這一天是把洋瓶子賣了六十三個銅子，第二天又把報紙賣了四十五個铜子度過的，兩天全　是買了五個銅子的芝麻醬，及一斤半的切麵，拌拌吃了，晚上就吃大餅。</p>
<p>「媽呀怎麽這兩天不吃飯，就吃一頓麵」？　　「唉！」</p>
<p>没有回答，只用一聲悠長的嘆息代替了。</p>
<h3>平凡的事（三十）</h3>
<p>— 澹果孫</p>
<p>之光聽見眞喜極了，跑到伯唐跟前，左手抓住右肩，右手抓住右手，對着他歇司蒂利亞似地喊道：</p>
<p>「這是那裏來的動力，伯唐！我也要把我那部機器自行車，捐給他們，多少也可以有點用處！」</p>
<p>「自然！</p>
<p>「我們怎樣通知廠裏的人呢？」</p>
<p>「我們可以就打電話告訴他們，呌他們明天早上來商量交割方法。」</p>
<p>他説完就跑着先打電話，之光和佩萸也跟在後面穿房出户，佩萸還一面説：</p>
<p>「只要你不亂跑，接濟東西我也不來阻擋…」</p>
<p>伯唐還没有走到電話跟前，電話的鈴子忽然狄伶伶地嚮個不住，伯唐回頭向他們説：</p>
<p>「這時候，快有十點鐘，一定是」爺老爺］的電話···］</p>
<p>説到這裏他已經摘下了話機了：</p>
<p>哈洛…就是我，姚伯唐…那一位？…啊，文卿兄，久違了…不出去，不出去，　…很好，很好…我在家裏拱候…很好，很好，一會兒再見。］</p>
<p>佩萸瞧見他掛上了話機就問：</p>
<p>［那個文卿？］</p>
<p>馬文卿，在法巡捕房做總繙譯的···他説有要緊的事就來看我，這倒呌我猜不着是甚麽事？…不用管，我們先給廠裏的人打電話要緊。」</p>
<p>接着他又摘下話機了。這一回，他費了好兩分鐘才通到南市，轉到廠裏；又費了好兩分鐘，才把要找來的代表找了過來。來了，他简單説了幾句呌對方聽到很滿意，約他們明天上午十二點鐘過來商量。</p>
<p>這個問題的談判，算是已經解决只候如何執行了，之光自然或以抽身，然而伯唐却留他多蹲一會兒，聽一聽文卿的消息，以後再呌阿明放車送他回去，因爲文卿和他們都是在巴黎相識的，而所謂緊要的事，也許與戰事有關。於是之光就在伯唐書房的烟榻上暫時躺下。</p>
<p>他醒來的時候，一瞧，文卿和伯唐正坐在烟榻左邊一張長靠椅上。他們大概已經已經談了好一會兒了，於是之光連忙起身和文卿周旋；不久文卿又接着那個談起了的問題談下去：</p>
<p>「那末，老伯還是昨天到這裏來的！」</p>
<p>「昨天；」伯唐説，「今天他老人家還没有來過。」</p>
<p>「現在可有法子找得着老伯？」</p>
<p>「這大概不容易，他老人家今天還没電話來。」</p>
<p>「老伯的公館在那裏？」</p>
<p>「馬斯南路。」</p>

<p>昨日粉市以洋麥報價、芝加哥回漲一元六角半、坎拿大漲二元八九角左右、故開價時人心曾見堅穩、惟以後各盤、因大小廠家均有出檔、數約十萬包左右、且以各處米價、顺早熟及秋收、預測均占大有、致市價步步鬆軟、因此做投機心思亦未免轉活、故洋麥雖漲、市况反呈平疲也、觀察後步、當看實銷如何、再定究竟、結果本月份較小二厘半、各月份好五厘、十月份好三厘半、十一月份小二厘半、餘無出入云、</p>

<h3>兩個「五十萬」</h3>
<p>— 小之</p>
<p>打開報來，相繼在「本埠新聞「裏和「國个新聞」裏發現了兩個「五十萬」的大標題新聞。是啊，「五十萬）５００，０００（該是多長多大多夠注意與驚人的數目！！</p>
<p>這數目，一個產生在咱們的中國，這當然便是「發財致富唯一機會」的「航空獎劵」的頭獎「五十萬」大洋錢！而另外一個則產生在咱們太平洋對岸的美國，這便是羅斯福總統的「復興計畫」實行後「五十萬」失業者有工作。　　關於咱們「發財」的事，咱已談了好多次，不再説了！現在只把美國的消息大略抄錄一些，好拿來與「咱們」做個比較：</p>
<p>）紐約（調查美國全國情形，下星期一實施全國實業總業規後，至少有五十萬賦閒者將在星期一淸晨（小之按：恰與咱們的「發財票」頭獎號碼公布日同一時間）可得工作，其工資最低者每星期平均可得十四元…工作時間每星期减爲三十五小時…』</p>
<p>在這裏我們便可以找着兩個絶大的不同點來：「咱們」閙的是洋錢，人家幹的是麵包；咱們只有一個幸運兒從此捧着「五十萬」大洋錢獨自開口張牙打哈哈，人家已有「五十萬」個人肚子從此不再打鼓般的呌了，脱去悉眉苦臉而飛着愉快的微笑！但，事實上大家同樣不能粉飾和逃避的是在這「星期一」以前：「咱們」方面差不多有五十萬人（按：這次發行的「獎券」總額有五十萬號）在日夜做夢祈禱着想得這「五十萬」的頭獎，因爲這將近五十萬的人都没有發財，都没有安樂舒服的生活：美國方面有五十萬以上的人没有工做没有麵包果腹，這都是像鐵一般的事實！而由於這些事實，我們可以看見這個社會已經走到了一個不景氣的極尖端而大有轉灣的傾向和必需了！所以，這裏無論他們怎樣的拿「五十萬」大洋錢給一個人「發財」給一個人享受安樂，自然是不能掩避，但是在這一世界上另一角落裏或竟在那同一個地方，還有十百於「五十萬」的失業者，他們没有工作，没有飯吃，他們有的失了知覺便在呻吟，然而這呻吟之聲已震得世界都有些動搖！他們有的在怒吼甚至於像瘋狂了！因爲事實上他們的確飽得太不像樣子了！</p>
<p>啊，「五十萬」，東西兩個［五十萬］）５００，０００（！好一個多長多大多夠注意與驚人的滑稽的數目啊！</p>

<h3>字典的妙用</h3>
<p>— 國榮</p>
<p>英文字典的功用似乎在出版各式字典的幾家書店的廣告上已登載得盡盡絶絶，從作文求解以至餽贈親友無不相宜；而用的人呢，抱着字典從翻譯大班的命令一直到拼凑洋文情書中的生字也無不各盡其妙用了。然而昨天我讀報之餘</p>
<h3>“三個和尙没水吃</h3>
<p>，却還給我發現了一種更偉大更神妙的用途，這用途是發現在七月二十九日的某報。</p>
<p>「蕭老師訪記」·噢·好大一問題</p>
<p>目｜粗看又當了是那位幽默祖師蕭伯訥的訪記，誰知一看下去，却是國貨的蕭老師。不錯，自已糊塗：今年國貨年，這蕭老師當然也是國貨的蕭老師囉。蕭老師者，上海宗敎硏究社乩壞之主持也。這壇上不用扶乩，安黄布一方，蒲團千餘：偳釋道耶回五敎敎主均降臨。問事者，坐蒲團上澄心觀幕，得現各種神光。那位晶報記者去「觀光」，左看右看却看見了幾個羅馬字，據説這是基督的暗示，因爲這記者曾受過洗禮。</p>
<p>聽好，妙文來了：「蕭云，十載前，曾於神光中見若干羅馬字母，殊不解。乃購英文大字典，焚於壇前；明日耶穌降壇，神光照耀，幕上現英文一篇。令善速記者錄取一通，譯成漢文，亦不外勸勉語也，」　好了，好了，妙文妙事，敬抄止此。</p>
<p>嗚呼，夫字典之爲用多矣，而能召救主耶穌者，則未之聞也，可是小子平生並無半點仙骨仙氣，所以字典竟能召耶穌降懂這一件事足足想了一晝一夜不曾得個究竟。耶穌而會　到中國乩壇上來，這件事本身已夠得上稱一聲自耶穌降生一千九百三十三年來宗敎上第一次發現的大秘密。而字典之能有和辰州符同　差神遺鬼的効力，更屬奇蹟中的奇蹟。噢，我噢了。耶穌是猶太人，根本不懂英語，更不懂現在坊間字典中所載的現代英語；而蕭老師左右的善速記者却也懂不提希伯萊語言。所以買了本英文字典一燒（不知是不是韋勃司脱大字典），耶穌拿到了字典，連夜翻字典把希伯萊語譯成英語，隔夜預備，此其所以等到「明日降壇」。或者蕭老師想上海的猶太富商哈同入了英籍，所以推論到耶穌也入了英籍？所以不買法文字典，不買德文字典，不買俄文字典，而買英文字典。英文字典可召耶穌，大概王雲五大辭典可召孔老夫子矣！乘商務書館各式字典預約特價的時候，勸諸位多買兩本，庶幾五大敎主隨時可召。</p>
<p>末了還有一點要請敎蕭老師的就是「神光」中耶穌敎所用的何以竟是羅馬數目字？耶穌旣不是亨得利史惟記老　，何以單單看中了鐘錶面上的羅馬字？大</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>概蕭老師以爲羅馬字者，羅馬時代羅馬人之語言也；而不知那時羅馬人用的却是拉丁文！</p>
<p>在這個年頭，再希奇些的把戲原也不足爲奇：不過今天竟有許多人打電話寫信去問蕭老師的法駕所在，可見的確有不少人受了蕭老師的吸引。在表面上看來，這原是一件不值得識者一笑的趣劇；然而仔細一體味這件事中所顯示的中國中上層社會的淺薄和無識，我祇能像看了諷刺人生的蕭伯訥的戲劇一樣地苦笑！</p>

<h3>病中絮語</h3>
<p>— 炳</p>
<p>我本是深信科學的西醫的，而於神而明之的玄學式的西醫，素來有點讓疑·但，幾經病魔的光顧，却使我發生了相反的信念，西醫我不絶對的信了</p>
<p>，　覺得　　實在有發掦光大的必要。</p>
<p>因爲病勢不輕，所以我愼重的車往ＸＸ著名醫院診治，在廣大的候診室裏足足坐了兩個鐘頭，才呌到五十八號的我，爬了兩道扶梯，拜見了醫生老爺。）醫生們實在應呌聲老爺（</p>
<p>「你有什麽毛病」？他目不轉珠地問　　「道頸上有些痛」！我用食指指着右頸上的痛處。</p>
<p>「幾天了」？</p>
<p>「兩天了！」</p>
<p>「是淋巴腺！進裏房去包紮，另外給你吃點瀉藥，没有效，過日來開刀，」！他已接過來另一位病人的看病證了，我睜着眼，放着哀求的光芒，嘴唇顫抖着想要求他爲我仔細地看看，爲的是我不僅頸上痛，實在還有其分更重要的毛病。但他是向我不耐煩的投了一眼，我只有識相點移進裏房去。</p>
<p>我想起了兩件往事。</p>
<p>去年四月我就上過一次天大的當，分明是白喉，分明不是毫無診救的病，但ＸＸ大醫院的博士醫生是診繼了我的存亡，一塊錢掛號，只赢得這麽兩句金言：「你害的是猩紅熱，這兒不收容，火急點往工部局醫院去吧！」於是我惘然了，我打量着死後的一切，因爲經過了這麽一個有名醫院的醫生的診繼，旣是無藥可治的猩紅熱，自然只有等候死了。但當時護送我的朋友，却硬裝着腔，終於把我送到了工部局醫院·結果也還是從白喉病裏撈回了我現在的性命。那著名的醫院，那博士醫生，至今，也許永遠使我不會遺忘的。</p>
<p>其次便是一位朋友生個背疽，這病請西醫診，無異議的要開刀，這也就使我得了一個深刻的認識·刀開過了，病却越益重起來，再看，是説還要開刀，理由是這樣：「前次開刀時，有些毒質散開了，所以又集中作祟·」一直開到五次，我那朋友才算從輾轉呻吟之中恢復了健康，感謝醫士的神明，在床上僅睡了兩個月，　花了多少白洋錢，更不用綢查了。</p>
<p>這番，我又要開刀，眞使我戰悸着起了絶大的懷疑：我這病到底是不是淋巴腺？唯一的診斷是不是開刀？一星期以來，頸上的痛處是漸見消散了，只是整個的身軀，還浸落在萎靡，暈沉，不思飲食的病魔裏，這又顯然可以證明我的病又被診斷錯了，你去申請吃服淸理藥，醫生老爺是這樣回答：「頸上的毒氣旣散開了，其他和毛病過日就會好的。」</p>
<p>我想西醫爲什麽這樣不興，壞就壞在一般醫生老爺，他們除了看要人名流的鼻涕傷風賣力討好外，看一般病人的病是馬虎極了，病人的生命隨時可以了結。若是中醫呢，盤問，探脈，醫案，醫方都來得　重·醫藥的各方淸通，也似乎要比西醫的牙縫裏出血便給你一杯水去嗽口，要高明可靠。</p>
<p>不過，過去的中醫是太缺乏科學精神了，希望從事發掦國醫，光大國醫的人注意這點而努力邁進。</p>

<h3>紅綠燈下（四十三）</h3>
<p>— 禧林</p>
<p>『有錢的人也有恨東洋人的啊；ＸＸ的紗廠倒閉，還不是因得東洋人搶去了生意吗？』這個男子抓住了這個简單的理由來反對，那個男子想要説的話似乎都是碍口的，祇得緘默着了。於是一齊看那邊人堆，準備看取那事的結果。這引得石喬有走進那個人堆裏去了。</p>
<p>那人堆裏，一個巡捕拉住一個人，那人却是長發。</p>
<p>石喬仔細認淸楚確然是楊介夫家的用人。</p>
<p>巡捕一手拿着一把印刷品，　一手用一個食指點着長發的鼻子。説：　　『頼，頼，你還頼嗎！這些是什麽，不是傳單是什麽？前方正打得緊，你們却在後方來搗亂，ＸＸ當道是有要國家的嗎！亡了國有什麽好處。」</p>
<p>『有要國家的有是我們窮人！我死也没有加入ＸＸ黨，到了捕房，大家自然明白的。』原來長發過去因當楊介夫走狗的時候，爲了要捉工廠的激進份子，與捕房裏的來往是很密切的，現在旣然和楊介夫鬧翻了，便也不願説明他過去的實在地位。確不料李石喬從人業中擠出來，挺身爲之保證道：</p>
<p>『弄錯了，他是楊介夫家裏的人，我是楊先生的親戚，所以常常看到他，他呌長發，我担保就是。』</p>
<p>那巡捕聽到楊介夫的名字，自然是怪熟耳的。只覺得這李石喬是個靑年學生模樣，而且怎的凑巧也在這難民收容所，一時委决不下，祇好膛目以視，李石喬領會了那目光的意思，便從衣中袋中抽出一張自已的名片，邊上刻着ＸＸＸＸ　團體聯合會常務委員的頭銜，並且説：</p>
<p>『我是代表聯合會來這兒慰問難民同胞的。這個人一定不是ＸＸ黨，或者是有人寃枉他。』</p>
<p>果然生了效，那巡捕連忙點頭道：</p>
<p>『啊，是，是，李先生，請以後呌他謹愼些好了。』</p>
<p>於是人堆散開來，小孩子們在大人的腿間先攢着走。</p>
<p>『…究竟説來，這傢伙也有些話説得不錯哇！『一人説·</p>
<p>『不過，打倒東洋人總是第一要緊：』一人感慨地答。</p>
<p>這邊，李石喬將長發領了出來。</p>
<p>『謝謝你，李先生·不過…請不要將這事告訴楊老爺。李先生怎麽也到這兒來的，是不是也來發…』原來長發在楊介夫家裏的時候早已懷疑石喬也是和他現在一樣的這個，事實上長發還不過是ＸＸ黨臨時買來做這工作的。</p>

<h3>影場新添一段佳話</h3>
<p>— 斯民</p>
<p>明月團　星光隱約</p>
<p>香衾綺膩消息迷離</p>
<p>這幾天在大光明演的「明月香衾『裡面的兩位主角，一個是雷門諾代羅，一個是茂娜洛漪。</p>
<p>現在據説他們已經秘密結婚了。或者他們還未結婚，而祇僅僅秘密訂婚。有人將這問題向茂娜探聽的時候，茂娜却是言語支吾，羞人答答的否認。當然她否認儘管否認，但是女子們忽然害起羞來，尤其是這般慣於做作的女明星們，難道説一些事情没有嗎？况且以前有許多女前星，和人家私婚了；等人家問的時候，還要强辯。可是她們芳心蕩漾的時候，面色上已經洩露了秘密。不等你説，人家早就知道。後來眞相亦居然發現了，和測騐一些不差。大概這回雷門諾伐羅和茂娜洛漪的事，亦是這麽一回事吧。</p>
<p>這樣説來，茂娜洛漪爲什麽要守秘密呢？或者這是雷門諾代羅的意思。他現在正在歐洲游歷，無從加以質問。但他卽使在好萊塢的話，新聞記者一定亦探聽不着什麽消息的。雷門諾伐羅是向來不和人談論愛情的事的。亦許他們婚絪的要守秘密，是茂娜的意思，因爲她向來關乎她的私事是極端神秘的。她在好萊塢許多年，從來没有人説過她和任何人發生過愛情。並且她從前説過，她結婚的時候，决不要什麽宣傳。或者這就是她實踐她主張的地方。</p>
<p>茂娜洛漪生平的脾氣，係很孤僻的。雖然有許多男明星，曾經向她表示熱心，但她從來没有表示接受過。一切公衆地方跳舞塲等，她去的時候很少。有人説她在好萊塢前後已經十一年，但是她厠身公衆娛樂的時候，還不過三十次之譜，並且她的男伴，亦從來没有一個人伴她好幾次的。</p>
<p>爲什麽她的脾氣這樣古怪呢？據説她亦是情場失意的過來人。她曾經愛過一個使君有婦之人。茂娜在銀幕上雖然看來很熱情浪漫，但她却不是勾引男子破壞人家家室的人。所以他就忍痛離開了他，並且矢口不提這事，以致外間知道這一段軼事的很少。</p>
<p>茂娜和雷門偌伐羅的愛情經過，並很深長的歷史。可以説他們愛情的進展，係差不多完全以「明月香衾」一片爲張本的。當「明月香衾」開拍的頭一天，有人替他們互相介紹了一下。介紹完畢之後，茂娜就回到她的化妝室去誦讀脚本了：這係她的照例文章。她從來和人演戲，演完了就回化妝室，很少留連於攝影塲内的。但是這回她和雷門合演「明月香　」，她居然漸漸改變了態度；她漸漸於拍完戲之後，留在攝影塲上和雷門並肩坐着談話。他們的態度很密切；分們的音調很綿綿。他們漸漸從公司裡飯廳的同餐，而跑到離攝影塲幾十里的地方去吃飯了。他們並且揀了僻靜的角落裏，兩個人吃着談着。後來他們晚飯亦同在一處吃了。並且他們於吃完晚飯之後，又同去看舞台劇。他們互相發現了對於音樂的共同嗜好。雷門的歌聲係大家所佩服者，或者最後的愛情一幕，就是雷門用他的情歌，一直打到茂娜心坎中最深的地方了。</p>
<p>但是雷門在没有遇見茂娜之前，已經和歐洲訂了合同。他不久以前到歐洲去了。這是一件無可奈何的事。但是雷門諾伐羅在山邊新造的住宅，現在是茂娜住在裡面了。雖説中茂娜向雷門租的，但是雷門大概决不等茂娜的租金吧。茂娜不時打開窗户，騎檻而坐，臨風懷想，諒亦不無盼念違人之感吧。</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3>評「一夕荒唐」</h3>
<p>— 伊文</p>
<p>ＡＬITTLE　ＳIDESLIP｜國泰演</p>
<p>這是一篇烏發最近的片子。是屬於專談風月的片子。烏發最近的製片方針。我想讀者也屢見及，更不必我來多述吧。</p>
<p>全片充滿了gag冷氣中時時有着淺淺的笑聲。當然是觀客在發着滿意的表情。</p>
<p>在這片子中，我們很可以知道一些德國上流社會的氲氤氣。一個很美滿的家庭，自然是要追求精神上的滿足，自然會流露出更細膩的情緒：但滿足是没有止境的，所以往往因爲些微的事故，造成了巨大的誤會。在夫婦的感情上霎時顯露了裂痕｜這片便是在這種地方取的題材。</p>
<p>在導演的技術上，所能給與我們一</p>
<p>些參考的，並不多｜在我的印象中覺得他在幕與幕的連接上，很有一些妙處。他時用音響效果來連接，例如這方唱歌的歌聲，在同樣的情調下連接到另一方的歌聲。書面雖則變了調，但仍能使你感到這片是有着Ｒhytdm的。不像我國的有聲片，幕與幕間，用着淡入淡出。使觀衆感到一種間斷的感覺。此外我是不知道了。</p>
<p>演員方面，實在是配置得很適當的。我不懂德文，在簡單的英文字幕之外，而能使我感到時時的好笑，這自然是徐來女士近影｜其處女作［殘春］現正攝竣，不日卽可公映</p>
<p>演員的動作上給我的印象。不能不説他們是對於這個戲是忠實的了。</p>
<p>演完了。我擠在紳士淑女間，自覺也紳士氣十足。歸，遂捉筆記之。</p>
<h3>評「夜世界」Ｎight　Ｗoild</h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>看了Ｈobart　Ｈerley的［夜世界］</p>
<p>使我們連想到但杜宇的「淸白」。他們同樣以社會黑暗面爲題材，同樣在紙醉金迷的黑影中穿揰一個戀愛的故事。</p>
<p>舞塲夜女人，謂，酒，使人沉醉，也使人憤恨。「夜世界」所人要盡情的暴露這些醜惡，無疑義導演何伯漢萊是懷着濃厚的憤恨心情，本來，假如我們不否認這些醜惡，全是現社會的病態，那末藝術家因之而引起其憎惡的心情，當然也是他們份内的事。雖然僅僅是憎恨或是咒駡，並不是對這些現狀最後的處理，然而在他們能夠將這些虚心的不留</p>
<h3>江西人鋸碗—自顧自</h3>
<p>復西</p>
<p>麗琳泰許門雖不是中國人，她却像我們的江西人—據説江西人都是鋸碗的—不，鋸碗的都是江西人（恐怕亦不見得，但我却没有實地調查過）祇曉得「自顧自」。麗琳在戯院裏看戱，纔好玩呢。她看了兩個鐘頭的戯，眼睛看在戯台上的，却不到十五分鐘。餘下的時間，她總是打開她的旅行美容室，拿著鏡子看自已。她忽然整理整理頭髪，忽然擦些粉，忽抺些臙脂，忙得不亦樂乎。　　她每次看戲，總是如此。戲台上的一班演員氣極了。他們有一天在閉幕之前，大家都拿了一個化妝匣子，在台上弄頭髪，擦脂抹粉，想要對麗琳泰許門示一下子威，呌她不要像江西人鋸碗—自顧自了。或是他們一番心血亦是白用的，因是麗琳在那個時候，頭亦没有擡一擡。</p>
<p>餘地的暴露出來，也不能不是較爲有意義的事了。</p>
<p>就「夜世界「的主題説，很明顯的，作者是在經濟基礎上來處理一切。夜總會，歌舞，喝酒，紳士淑女們的狂歡，大腿，肉的抖顫，戀愛，偷情，爭風吃醋，暗鬥，殺人，惡徒，大盜，這些這些，當然不是「美德」而是所謂「世風日下」。所以在這裏作者很眞實的告訴我們，他們都是爲了錢，於是現社會所以會有如此現狀發生，我們不難知道是這經濟機構的不合理。</p>
<p>導演説明了這些，同時也把握了這些。這是用不着舉例的，反正整個的便是在這解釋之下而進展。他在前面將整個的輪廓强調的介紹出來，然後便细膩的説明這一故事的骨容。鏡頭角度的美妙，證明他手法的嫻熟。無論如何，在形式上正和，内容恰好的完成。不過嚴格的説來，表演方面是不大好看的，也不是和一般影片同樣的誇張。反之，雖然不曾使這作品更增進他的價值而成爲盡善盡美，但是他們演員還能夠克盡厥職，也是我們不能否認的了。</p>
<p>然而那個父親死於母手的少年，和和</p>
<p>那舞女的戀愛，到底是没有必要，雖然那少年在劇中很有力量。特别是他們將被殺於大盜之前而來一個接吻，那種欣然就死的表顯究竟是很可笑的。這是演員的無力，也是導演的疏忽。　　最後我不想將這「夜世界」和」淸白」比較一下，固然在二者之間，自内容以至形式都有不少的差異。</p>
<p>附帶的説一句，也許這是一張舊片子，但因爲這是Ｕniversalpicture中不易多得的作品，所以也就約略評之如上</p>
<h3>天一本年代表作</h3>
<p>— 武生</p>
<p>天一公司謂一九三二年出品的代表作「蘭谷萍踪」，我們已認識過了。該公司最近拍竣的「掙扎」已正式宣言爲該公司一九三三年出品的代表作，該片意識健全，導演演出的技巧，亦臻完善。茲將片劇情簡單地介紹於後：　　馮大昭，與子根發，務農爲業，根發與同村女郎許小蘭相戀，小蘭早失怙恃，依叔父許榮以居。大昭因欠租事遭地主耿道毆打，根發因與理論，亦遭豪奴之毆。適小蘭至，大道　見，驚其美，欲納爲妾。許榮固勢利小人，欣然允之。是晚大昭意不起，根發揮淚葬父，哀慟欲絶。小蘭得知乃叔之將　已‘急奔告根發，遂偕遞至滬。光陰迅速，根發與小蘭同居已二年，且舉一子，時大道來滬，偶遇根發小蘭，乃探得其居地，遂嗾許榮控根發誘拐。於是根發被判徒刑，小蘭由許榮領回。其子則由育嬰堂代爲撫養。許榮旣得小蘭，卽以之爲大道妾。粘蘭謀殺大道。因佯作歡顏，勸大道飲，及醉，攫刃刺之，不中，刃爲大道奪去。掙扎多時，小蘭竟死刃下。根發期滿出獄，家破人亡，茫無所歸。時國難方作，卽從戎去。一日，根發見敞人襲擊難民，乃發槍斃敵，孰料所救者卽仇人大道。根發欲槍殺之，但忽又轉念，殺敵之槍，不應假之以復私仇，竟捨之。後根發終死於戰地云。</p>

<h3>Military Affairs Committee Watches Feng's Telegram</h3>
<p>Recognizing that Feng Still Lacks Sincerity for Peace</p>
<p>Traffic on the PingSui Railway is Interrupted, Extreme Vigilance in the Xuanhua Area</p>
<p>(Beiping) Feng Yuxiang issued a circular telegram yesterday. The Military Affairs Committee held its routine meeting this morning. The telegram was circulated among the generals for their review. Now, a telegram has been sent to He Yingqin in Nanjing and Jiangxi seeking instructions on how to respond. Sun Liangcheng is currently maintaining extreme vigilance in Xuanhua. It is rumored that the righteous army leader Deng Wen was executed by Feng by gunfire because Deng intended to lead his troops to return to the central government. The train on the PingSui line only reaches Shacheng. (2nd Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Military Affairs Committee held its routine meeting this morning to discuss the situation in Chahar, and discuss military education and barracks construction, among other issues. (2nd Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Gao Shuxun's troops of Feng's forces and Lei Zhongtian Yu's advancing army of Sun Liangcheng's forces are currently constructing fortified positions between Xuanhua and Xinzhuangzi. Ji Hongchang's troops are all deployed south of the railway line. (2nd Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Traffic on the PingSui Railway is interrupted. Only the 30-li stretch between Shacheng and Xuanhua is open. Train service between Xuanhua and Baotou continues as usual. Passengers between Ping and Bao are subject to severe inspections and must walk 30 li between Shacheng and Xuanhua. Mail is being delivered as usual. (2nd Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Lushan conference has made concrete decisions on how to resolve the Chahar situation. Huang Shaohong will depart for Beiping immediately to discuss handling the matter with He Yingqin and Huang Shaohong. (2nd Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Beiping Military Affairs Committee held a routine meeting at 10:00 am on the 2nd. Qin Dechun, Men Zhizhong, Wei Yisan, Jiang Bocheng, Xiong Bin, Wan Fulin, Shang Zhen, He Yingqin, and more than ten others attended. Song Zheyuan was absent due to illness. Chairman He, in addition to discussing internal reorganization matters, also circulated Feng Yuxiang's circular telegram of the 31st. The meeting adjourned at noon. (2nd Day Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to reliable information from Zhangjiakou, after Feng Yuxiang declared himself Commander-in-Chief in Zhangjiakou, he indiscriminately recruited bandits and miscellaneous troops and forcibly reorganized the righteous army, intending to expand his power without regard for the burden on the local area and the people. In the past two months, he has appointed no fewer than sixty or seventy army commanders and division commanders. Just yesterday, he appointed Geng Jizhou as the commander of the 35th Army and Zhou Juemin as the deputy commander. However, it is said that the army commanders and division commanders appointed by Feng have only three to five hundred soldiers under their command, and at most eight to nine hundred. (2nd Day Central News Agency Telegram) (Beiping) A spokesperson for the Military Affairs Committee stated that since the cessation of hostilities in North China, most of the frontline armies have been restored. Song Zheyuan's troops stationed in Chahar have also been ordered by the local military and political authorities to return to defend Chahar. The Military Affairs Committee's order was issued on June 17th, with the main points as follows: "The 29th Army and the 40th Army are ordered to relocate to Chahar Province." The Political Affairs Committee's instruction was also issued on the same day, with the original text as follows: "Having investigated that the chairman (Song Zheyuan) was previously in charge of military affairs, the duties were temporarily handled by Jian Yong, the Director of the Civil Affairs Department. Now, given the importance of provincial affairs, the chairman should be ordered to return to his post immediately to fulfill his duties. Jian Yong need no longer act as chairman and should report the date of his return for investigation. This order must be followed." The documents are available and can be reviewed. The authorities concerned have always insisted on Song's return to Chahar to preside over provincial affairs. This is consistent with the remarks of Feng's representative reported in various Japanese newspapers, who said that the current focus is still on hoping that Song will return to Chahar to preside over everything, and that there is no question of Feng's troops withdrawing. If Feng truly hopes that Song will return to Chahar with sincerity, then why not cede Xuanhua and Zhangjiakou earlier, and instead allow his recruited miscellaneous troops and bandits to occupy the Zhangjiakou and Xuanhua area, making Song feel unable to exercise his authority and delaying his return to office? Feng's representative also said that his actions in Chahar are not a secession. However, Feng has occupied Chahar Province, declared himself Commander-in-Chief, and indiscriminately appointed dozens of commanders and division commanders. He has arbitrarily changed the organization of the provincial government, recruited bandits, and imposed heavy taxes. If this is not considered a secession, then it must be like the pseudo-organization's occupation of the Northeast before it can be called a secession. Recently, Feng has also taken advantage of convening military conferences to lure Deng Wen and others to Zhangjiakou and execute them by gunfire. He has forcibly dispersed and reorganized Deng's troops. Li Zhongyi is also being secretly monitored by Feng. With life and death so unpredictable, which of the righteous army generals in Zhangjiakou would not be terrified and fearful? And how would those who usually advocate for public justice, patriotism, and the defense of unity dare to approach him? The order for Song Weifeng to return to Chahar to administer the government cannot be immediately implemented, and this is one of the most important reasons. Feng still wants to quibble and cover up his faults, and he probably lacks sincerity for peace in the Chahar situation. (2nd Day Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to well-informed Chinese sources, the situation in Chahar turned for the worse today. Feng published a reply to Wang Jingwei and Chiang Kai-shek's telegram, without changing his attitude. It is said that he declared in the telegram that he would still engage in resistance against Japan. This morning, He Yingqin convened a meeting of the Military Affairs Committee to discuss the situation in Chahar. All important military leaders attended the meeting. The results were kept strictly confidential. However, it is said that the attendees all expressed the sentiment that the Chahar situation should be resolved as soon as possible. This afternoon, according to Chinese newspapers, there are reports that there has been a misunderstanding between the central government troops and the Chahar troops. This information has yet to be verified. (1st Day Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Feng Yuxiang is extremely busy preparing for war. The Zhangjiakou arsenal is working day and night to produce bullets. The only train repair factory on the PingSui line has now been converted into a military factory. Furthermore, 140 freight cars and 14 locomotives have been detained. The PingSui line is open to Shacheng, and communication with Baotou continues on six sides. (2nd Day Japanese Union Telegram)</p>

The inspector of this road will be sought again. (2nd Day Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Japanese Army Fiercely Attacks the Righteous Army</h3>
<p>(Shenyang) Since the second attack on the triangular area, Li Chunrun, who was lurking near Fenghuangcheng and colluding with Zhang Xueliang's faction in Beiping, joined forces with Li Cheng and others, and concentrated about 600 righteous soldiers near Longwang Temple. The Lianshanguan unit of the Independent Garrison and two battalions of the [Manchukuo] army launched a joint attack.

<h3>Sun Tonggang Flew to Ji'nan</h3>
<p>Ten Thousand People Emptied the Streets of Ji'nan to Welcome Him</p>
<p>Father and Son Meet, Tears Streaming Down Their Faces</p>
<p>(Ji'nan) At 11:30, Sun Tonggang flew from Xuzhou to Ji'nan. Ten thousand people emptied the streets to welcome him at the airfield. After Sun landed, he met with his father and brothers. Sun's father was overjoyed and saddened, with tears streaming down his face like threads. After stopping</p>
<h3>Sun Tonggang Photographed Taking off in Beijing</h3>
<p>For a moment, he took off again and flew around the city three times. The citizens applauded and cheered under the fluttering national flags. The grand occasion was unprecedented. After half a point, he returned to the airfield and landed. Military music played loudly, and applause roared. Sun got out of the plane and exchanged greetings with the welcomers one by one. The whole group took a photo together. Sun told reporters that this time when he returned to China, he felt that the construction was a little better than when he went abroad, but it was not unified and the national defense was empty, especially the air defense was nonexistent. The enemy could come at any time and drop bombs on our heads, which was extremely dangerous. The premier said that saving the country through aviation cannot be delayed. His family is in Ji'nan and he plans to stay for a long time. After repairing the plane, the second step is to fly around the country again. Because there are many welcomers in various places, he met Chiang in Jiangxi. Chiang was very polite. The first time they met, Chiang said that we must first seek domestic unity and then talk about national defense. In the evening, Chiang invited him to dinner, with only one person left, but talked about his experience in Germany. Yesterday when he was about to reach _, he encountered thunderstorms and turned back to Xuzhou. The weather is still not good today. He flew at an altitude of 1,700 meters in the clouds and did not see Mount Tai passing over the Yellow River. He descended from the cloud cave and turned back. At this time, Sun was busy shaking hands with the welcomers and was surrounded by photographers. At 1:00 p.m., he walked out of the airfield. Zhan Shutang, the division commander of the 81st Division, sent eight companies of soldiers to send him off. All the brigade commanders and below stood at attention and saluted. After walking about one mile, he took a car back to his residence. The family and father and son gathered together and had a casual lunch. Then, he visited Han. Han gave him comfort and encouragement. When Sun got off the plane, he brought three bouquets of fresh flowers and gave them to his mother and two sisters-in-law. (2nd Day Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Taiwanese Provocations in Xiamen</h3>
<p>Two Assault on Police Cases Occur</p>
<p>Datong Road Experiences a Market Strike</p>
<p>(Xiamen) Two cases of Taiwanese assaulting police occurred in Xiamen City on the 2nd. In the first case, on Siming East Road, armed police stopped Taiwanese from surrounding and beating a peddler. They were surrounded, beaten, and their guns were seized unsuccessfully. Then Japanese police arrived to stop and disperse them. When the armed police went to Siming South Road, they were intercepted and beaten by a large group of Taiwanese. Police officers Yan Zhenhai and Qiu He were seriously injured. The group dispersed. In the second case, at the Tao Yu store on Datong Road, Taiwanese beat a buyer. Police went to rescue him and were beaten. Armed police rushed to the scene, and the Taiwanese hid in the store. Nearby shops closed temporarily. No one was arrested in either place. The Taiwanese seem to be acting intentionally. The whole of Xiamen is uneasy about this. On the 2nd, Japanese Consul Tsukamoto called on the municipal government and the Public Security Bureau to express his apologies for the Taiwanese assault and looting of the 19th Route Army quartermaster officer, promising to arrest the murderers and deal with them severely, and strictly forbade the dispatch of military force thereafter.

<p>The Censor's Opinion on the Jiangsu Provincial Government's Defense</p>
<h3>Believing There is No Need to Respond</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) After the Censorate impeached Zhao Qilu and the Jiangsu Provincial Government re-issued its defense, a certain official of the Censorate said that the Censorate should exercise its powers and automatically impeach, but due to financial reasons, it is difficult for committee members to personally visit various places for investigations, as the travel expenses, accommodation, and all expenses are difficult to bear. Therefore, we have to rely on people's complaints. This also has its own unavoidable difficulties. However, after receiving the people's complaints, we must also send personnel to re-investigate and carefully deal with the matter, so as to avoid wrongful imprisonment and excessive leniency. How can it be said that there is no basis? Since this matter has been impeached, we should wait for the punishment committee to deal with it. There is no need to respond to the Jiangsu Provincial Government's defense. (2nd Day Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Huang Musong Hosts the Capital Press</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) On the evening of the 2nd, Huang Musong hosted the press at the World Hotel and invited personnel from relevant border affairs agencies to accompany him. More than a hundred people attended. Huang reported on his visit to Xinjiang for the comfort mission. Since the Japanese consul was hosting a banquet at the same time, he left early, and his staff member Chanhui Aysha reported on the situation in Xinjiang in great detail. The meeting lasted for an hour and a half. (2nd Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Huang Musong hosted a banquet for reporters on the evening of the 2nd, with more than eighty people attending. During the banquet, Huang delivered a speech, saying briefly that he was ordered to fly to Dihua and saw that the situation was serious and people were panicked. The Xinjiang issue is the most important in southern Xinjiang. The office sent Ma Zhenghai and other five people to Yanqi, Aksu, Kashi, and Hotan in southern Xinjiang, and hired Hami Prince Nez尔 as a senior consultant to personally comfort Turpan and Hami. Unfortunately, there was a second political change in the Governor’s Office, the shooting of Tao Yue, the Secretary-General of the Provincial Government, Chen Zhong, the Chief of Staff of the Military Camp, and Li Xiaotian, the Chief of the Aviation Office. Although Dihua was spared the scourge of war, the entire southern Xinjiang and Hami in the northeast, and the Altai in the north, are still in a state of separation. Even other aspects have not been able to truly cooperate. After the second political change, all parties have more doubts, and the future is even more worrying. Those who care about Xinjiang affairs and national defense should pay close attention. Xinjiang has always been a land of peace and abundance, as recorded in history. If the people of the country exert all their efforts to develop it, its benefits will be immeasurable. In this era of aerial competition, it now takes only four days to fly from Dihua to Berlin. If we can take advantage of the situation and develop Xinjiang, which is close to European culture, first, border defense can be expected to be permanently consolidated. Then the staff member Chanhui Aysha gave a speech. Aysha is a local Uyghur from Xinjiang and is proficient in Chinese studies, especially rich in national thought. He described how the Uyghurs were oppressed by White Russians and Jin Shuren, which led to the outbreak of incidents. Jin initially used the White Russians, and then signed unequal treaties with Soviet Russia. When he learned that the central government had sent personnel to comfort the people, the people's sentiments became more inclined towards the central government. He then described the importance of Xinjiang's status. Britain, France, Russia, and Japan all harbor desires, but the people of the country are indifferent. He hoped that the press would promote the rapid development of the northwest so that Xinjiang would not be reduced to a foreign land. (2nd Day Central News Agency Telegram)</p>

<h3>The Sichuan Disaster That Cannot Be Ignored</h3>
<p>Letter.</p>
<p>Since Deng and Liu clashed in Sichuan, with fighting between Chongning and Guanxian, transportation has been cut off and news is unclear. However, this issue has long drawn the attention of the nation. Yet, it has been unable to stop the conflict between Deng and Liu. Moreover, amidst calls for a ceasefire, Liu Xiang has also joined, turning it into a second struggle between the two Lius. However, this struggle between the two Lius is slightly different from the previous one. The previous war was to compete for the position of leader in Sichuan, for the salt tax of Zigong, and for the fertile defense lands of southern Sichuan. Now, Liu Wenhui not only lacks the strength to be a leader but also has no intention of leading. He only intends to survive temporarily and slightly expand his territory. Therefore, he first challenged Deng Xihou, who had weaker strength and internal disunity. Unexpectedly, Deng's army was able to barely maintain its position, and Liu Wenhui's army could not achieve rapid success. Thus, the effects spread and the chaotic situation in Sichuan became impossible to control.</p>
<p>The most worrying aspect of this matter is that the communist bandits fleeing between Sichuan and Shaanxi not only lurk in cities and secretly spread into rural areas, conducting various grassroots movements, but also openly loot and plunder, causing Tongjiang, Nanjiang, Bazhong, and other counties to fall one after another. The middle and lower classes of Sichuan Province are oppressed by taxes and harassed by conscription, making them easily seduced by the communists. There are many who blindly follow them. Therefore, this poor and desperate group is able to roam freely for thousands of miles, seizing prefectures and counties without fear. The local warlords of Sichuan, who take pride in their territory, have always had the mentality of local emperors. They only know how to seize power and engage in warfare, and have no regard for the people. The talk of suppressing the communists has been proclaimed for a long time. In the beginning, the communist bandits were entrenched only in the extremely northern and remote areas of Sichuan. The warlords did not engage in suppression but instead used it as an opportunity to increase taxes. Little did they expect that the communists would take advantage of this and gradually spread.</p>
<p>Up to now, a portion of Tian Songyao's forces even find it difficult to resist, and they have had to propose a joint encirclement and suppression amidst the pervasive war clouds.</p>
<p>Based on the past history of Sichuan and observing the current state of affairs, if the central government does not provide strict supervision and the people do not express a united and resolute stance, then the future of Sichuan is far from optimistic. First, the defense zone system in Sichuan has been in place for a long time. Today's Sichuan warlords regard the land under their control as feudal domains in ancient times. They independently establish systems for grain taxes and levies. Finance and administration are also independent. In the current situation of seven rival powers, although Liu Cunhou is confined to a corner, he can still use his provincial diplomacy to barely survive. Deng Xihou's strength has weakened after this war. Tian Songyao is even weaker than Deng. Yang Sen's strength is below Deng and Tian. Liu Wenhui has 100,000 troops and can still fight, but after two battles between the two Lius and Liu and Deng, his strength is also not as good as before. Currently, only Liu Xiang has elite troops and advanced equipment, occupies a prosperous area, and has convenient transportation. He has a general appearance of commanding and leading the others. However, there is no hope that he will unify Sichuan and use his remaining strength to sweep away the bandit scourge. Second, the people have deep resentment towards the Sichuan warlords. Middle-class elements, although they hate the Communist Party and want to maintain the existing order, also have no good feelings towards the excessive exploitation by the Sichuan warlords and the harassment of the troops everywhere. As for the unemployed farmers and the wandering laborers, they originally have no fixed allegiance. Occupying mountains as bandits and gathering crowds to commit crimes has existed since ancient times. They also lack the necessary knowledge to distinguish right from wrong and have no love for the country. Based on this situation, popular resentment is accumulating internally, and the situation in Sichuan is becoming increasingly unpredictable. Third, the two provinces of Shaanxi and Gansu, which are adjacent to northern Sichuan, are suffering from severe drought. The people in twenty-six counties cannot even find grass and tree bark to eat. Acts of desperation are likely to affect the Sichuan border. Furthermore, the major disaster in western Hubei has just been pacified. Local order has not been completely restored, and the remnants of the bandits have not been completely eliminated. Moreover, the likes of He and Duan are familiar with the situation on the Sichuan border, and their invasion of Sichuan is also a cause for concern. With these three factors, it is already feared that it will be difficult to successfully suppress the bandits with such a complex army. Moreover, today's bandit suppression issue is not just a simple military victory. It must also be resolved appropriately politically, with the possibility of stabilizing the national economy and the hope of establishing social order. Only then can bandit suppression be successful. If the internal situation in Sichuan is like this today, if one wants to rise up and put things in order, the central government must have a comprehensive political plan, first resolve the abnormal state of Sichuan, curb the atrocities of the Sichuan warlords, and then appoint military officials to lead the scattered masses and gradually achieve the success of suppression and pacification. Only then can the situation in Sichuan be hopeful.</p>
<p>Obstacles to the Restoration of Diplomatic Relations Between the United States and Russia Eliminated</p>
<h3>Roosevelt Convenes a Meeting at Hull's and Morgenthau's Residence to Discuss</h3>
<p>A Formal Announcement on Policy Towards Russia Is Forthcoming</p>
<p>The Selection of an Ambassador is Under Careful Consideration</p>
<p>(New York) (Today's reliable sources indicate that when Secretary of State Hull meets with President Roosevelt next Sunday, the issue of restoring diplomatic relations between the United States and Russia will be the main topic of discussion. Hull will return from England and arrive in New York on Friday or Saturday morning. He will then go directly to Hyde Park to meet with the President. It is expected that Undersecretary of the Treasury Morgenthau will also come to discuss the matter together. It is anticipated that the results of the deliberations will lead to an early decision on the policy towards Russia. It is said that what the US President wants to know most at this time is whether the Soviet Russian representatives in London, in their meeting with Hull and Coulondre, provided sufficient guarantees to quell the opposition voices in the United States against recognition. According to the US government's view, the reasons for opposing the recognition of Soviet Russia during the previous administration have mostly disappeared at this time. For example, regarding the fact that Soviet Russia has not yet recognized the old debts of the Tsarist and Kerensky eras and has not expressed a willingness to repay them, since there is now more than just Soviet Russia that is delinquent in payments and refusing to repay debts, it can no longer be a reason to oppose recognition. Moreover, the opposition arguments of former Wilson administration Secretary of State Colby and current Chief Justice Hughes, based on the grounds that Soviet Russia's national planning and economic system are incompatible with the republican government system and that trade with it would be difficult, are no longer sufficient because the United States also has a planned and controlled economic system today. As for concerns about the propaganda of communism and the Soviet system, the US government now believes that there is no need to worry about them. It is also heard that the US President is considering candidates for the position of ambassador to Russia after recognition. Philip Litell, formerly a secret reporter for Rothstein in Europe, is one of the candidates under consideration. Litell is a well-known journalist who was the first American to guarantee that the Soviet Union would establish a permanent political system. During the European war, he served as President Wilson's secret reporter in Europe. It is also heard that any differences of opinion between Hull and Morgenthau regarding the London meeting have been completely resolved. There is no longer any talk of Hull resigning, and it is said that Hull and Morgenthau are in agreement on the issue of Soviet Russia and may submit a joint proposal as early as Monday.)

<p>The Key to Peace or War Between Japan and Russia</p>
<h3>The Military Advocates for a Second War Between Japan and Russia to Break the Deadlock</h3>
<p>Financial and Political Circles Want to Find a Way Out Through the Economy</p>
<p>(Tokyo) (The Japanese business and industrial circles and the government are very pessimistic about the future of the domestic economy. According to observations of the feelings of various countries towards Japan, it seems that various countries are adopting a gradual economic blockade policy towards Japan. If peaceful means are used, it may be difficult to break through the deadlock. Many military officers, led by a major general, advocate for a second war between Japan and Russia, using the large consumption of war to postpone the crisis in domestic commerce and industry. The Japanese military estimates the attitudes of the various imperialist countries, saying that in a separate war between Japan and Russia, the countries would not help in the war. At least France could provide spiritual support to Japan. Under this unilateral decision, the Japanese warlords are vigorously promoting war opportunities. Because Russia is avoiding war, the Japanese warlords only sigh that there is no place for their talents. Officers of the General Staff even openly declared that the opportunity for war is around October this fall, provoking Russia as much as possible. However, the financial and political circles tend to avoid war. War would shorten the lives of the financial magnates and lead to the demise of politics. Therefore, they try to avoid war as much as possible. The two sides are in their final struggle. The method planned by the financial and government circles to break through the deadlock is to maintain the existing strength of trade. To maintain the status quo, Japan will ask various countries to sign new commercial treaties based on reciprocal tariff systems and equal numbers of imports and exports. The tariff law will adopt a dual tax system to levy heavy taxes on countries without treaties in order to achieve its retaliatory purpose. However, the military still takes a different approach, single-mindedly pursuing its war policy. Whether the Far East will have peace depends on whether the Japanese warlords repent and renew themselves.) (Second Day, China United Press)</p>
<p>Observations from Russian Newspapers</p>
<h3>The Characteristics of International Diplomacy</h3>
<p>Imperialism Secretly Conducting Groups</p>
<p>Advancing Towards a Return to Pre-War Strategies</p>
<p>France's Occupation of the Coral Islands Truly Starts the Beginning of a Future Great War</p>
<p>(Moscow) (The Communist Party's mouthpiece, "Pravda," believes that the obvious results of the Geneva and London world conferences are the restoration of "old diplomacy" and pre-war strategies (not post-war strategies). The newspaper stated that Geneva has produced a slogan of "repeating the adoption of old diplomatic policies." At present, the restoration of secret diplomacy and the creation of groups and alliances has been openly resumed. Fascist Germany is dreaming of its European group. British imperialism is seeking the unity of various parts of the empire at a frenetic pace. And American imperialists are arming their means with economic nationalism. Various groups are in the process of formation, and various alliances are the object of frenetic pursuit, and secret diplomacy will be the method for creating various groups. "The newspaper concluded," The era of peace conferences and negotiations is over. We have entered a "period of quiet and intense preparation for the most chilling conflicts and wars in the imperialist world. Imperialists are no longer hiding this kind of preparation. The contradiction has exceeded all limits. We are indeed living in a pre-war period again.") (First Day, TASS)</p>
<p>(Moscow) (Today, Pravda, in commenting on the situation in the Far East, pointed out that the actions of imperialists are becoming more active and that the struggle for the Chinese market is becoming more profound. And this kind of struggle has now begun to take on a particularly sharp way. The newspaper said, "The struggle over controlling China and dominating the Pacific is mainly occurring between Japan and the United States. However, the deepening of this struggle has prompted other imperialist powers to strengthen their activities. British imperialism is the backer of Japan's opposition to the United States in the Pacific. French imperialism is now also very obvious in the Far East struggle." Pravda, after pointing out France's recent occupation of several coral islands off the coast of Indochina and the United Press's report that France and the United States had reached an agreement on this matter, declared that "the struggle in the Far East is constantly expanding, and the current events are indeed a prelude to a great war.") (First Day, TASS)</p>
<h3>Japan Confronts Britain and the United States</h3>
<p>We and the League of Nations Cooperate Technically</p>
<p>Japanese Warlords Again Exaggerating Their Words</p>
<p>(Tokyo) (The Japanese military today issued another opinion on the cooperation between the League of Nations and our country. The content of the talk is very long. The outline is extracted as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Song Ziwen will visit the United States again and is scheduled to return to China on September 5. The Sino-Japanese problem will worsen again at this time. (2) The Japanese government and public believe that Song Ziwen's activities in Europe and the United States are focused on borrowing money. According to news obtained by the military, Song Ziwen's work is to cooperate on a global scale and win over Britain and the United States as backers to oppose Japan. (3) Some people believe that Song Ziwen's campaign was not very successful. According to news obtained by the military, Song Ziwen's diplomacy has indeed achieved unexpected success. (4) The current situation has become a Sino-Japanese confrontation. The Japanese government and public have recognized that Song Ziwen's return to China has entered the final stage of a global confrontation between Britain, Japan, and the United States. Under this recognition, they are preparing everything. (5) The policy towards China has entered the stage of a global policy towards the world. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs should consider the policy towards China from the standpoint of world policy. (6) After Song Ziwen returns to China, the boycott of Japanese goods will become more intense. A part of the Japanese government and public believes that Song Ziwen and Chiang Kai-shek will soon clash. This expectation is completely unreliable. Chiang Kai-shek will definitely accept Song Ziwen's policy towards Japan, and the pro-Japanese faction in North China may have no place to stand. Therefore, the Japanese military and civilians must realize this as soon as possible.</p>
<p>The Japanese warlords, based on the above reasons, demand that the Japanese people rise up and force the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to take necessary steps.) (Second Day, China United Press)</p>
<p>The Pseudo-Organization Implements a Centralized System</p>
<h3>In Fact, It Is Japan's Annexation Plan</h3>
<p>All Forty-Odd County Magistrates Replaced</p>
<p>(Changchun) ([Manchukuo] has decided to reform local administration and is currently considering concrete laws. The first step is to replace the county magistrates, that is, to replace all the county magistrates of more than forty counties, and transfer the power to appoint county magistrates to the central government to establish a centralized system.) (Second Day, Japan United Press)</p>
<p>(Changchun) (Since the Japanese Kwantung Army occupied our four eastern provinces, its control has only extended to the railway lines. In order to control the entire territory, the Japanese army has decided to transfer the county magistrates of more than forty counties. From now on, all local officials must be directly appointed by the central government in order to achieve the goal of centralization. In the past, they held county administration in the name of participating officers or instructors. From now on, they will appoint Japanese as county magistrates to directly control the politics of each county.) (Second Day, China United Press)</p>
<h3>Zhang Xueliang Visits British Military Exercises</h3>
<p>Leaving No Mustache, Weight Gained</p>
<p>Claiming to Be Completely Different</p>
<p>Especially Interested in Studying Fascism in Rome</p>
<p>The Italian Prime Minister Specially Appointed Experts for Consultation</p>
<p>(London) General Zhang Xueliang today visited British military exercises in Aldershot. (Second Day, Havas)</p>
<p>(London) Today, Zhang Xueliang told a Reuters reporter that this trip has been very beneficial to him. His weight has now increased by twenty-eight pounds compared to when he first left China, and his body is also stronger than before. At the same time, he has also shaved off his mustache. Zhang claims to be completely different. Those traveling with him include his two sons, private secretary Mr. Li, and advisor Donald. They may fly to Berlin on August 12 and then go to Norway and Sweden. The only purpose of Zhang's travels is to inspect modern aviation and naval and army equipment. Zhang's two sons will stay here for tutoring in order to prepare for admission to Oxford University. Zhang will come to London in November with his wife and daughters, who are now in Rome. Zhang said that he would very much like to live in London because London's parks, squares, and the ease and freedom of the people have given him a very good impression. No wonder Britain was the first to break away from the world's economic pressure. Zhang and his sons like London more than other parts of Europe. (Second Day, Reuters)</p>
<p>Reuters, Rome, July 1. Since arriving in Europe, Zhang Xueliang has been traveling and inspecting with great interest. When he arrived at Brindisi by boat, the Italian government specially prepared a car to take him to Rome. The Italian government has been very hospitable, making him feel at home. Zhang has rented a house here with a swimming pool and a tennis court. Zhang leads his family to live in this country. Now, after several months, Zhang is swimming and playing tennis, focusing on exercise. However, he does not often play golf because he feels that the green golf course here is very strange, unlike the stone-paved road of the Beiping racecourse. Zhang has visited various dignitaries here and has met with the Italian Emperor and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini for a long time. The Italian Prime Minister is very interested in the events currently taking place in China, and Zhang himself has expressed a special interest in the fascist system. The Italian government has specially appointed experts to provide him with consultation and to inform him of the organization and operation methods of fascism. Zhang is, of course, also very interested in naval, land, and aviation events. He has visited the Air Force Command many times and has also inspected the airfield with Italian Aviation Minister General Balbo. He is now studying Italian military administration. In late this month, Zhang will travel to England and France to inspect military affairs, but he also wants to conduct comparative studies of the government systems of various countries, and especially pay attention to the experiments currently being carried out in several Central European countries. Zhang hopes to travel to Turkey to observe its new policies and plans to visit Germany and Russia. Zhang sees that the methods of handling affairs in China and abroad are very different, and he is deeply impressed. The European roads especially touch Zhang's heart. Zhang recently traveled by car between Rome and Paris, driving hundreds of miles. The roads are flat. Except in cities and towns, he travels seventy miles per hour. The scenery along the way is very good. Zhang looks around and enjoys it. Sometimes he drives himself for two hundred miles. One day, he drove about five hundred miles, traveling in sunny areas. It is truly enjoyable. Zhang flew from Paris to London for a few days, staying for a few days, paying attention to the military performances of Wellington and Aldershot, but he did not have time to browse the British scenery because he had to talk to Song Ziwen. Zhang is in excellent health and has gained weight. His face is round and his body is strong, similar to his appearance ten or twelve years ago. His diet and daily life are also moderate. News reporters often want to get his interview, but Zhang does not want to talk about the Chinese political situation, nor does he want to get close to any Chinese political party, so as to avoid disputes. But Zhang is very interested in the development of recent events in China, and he also often receives letters and telegrams urging him to return home immediately.</p>

<h3>The Great Economic Revolution in the United States</h3>
<p>700,000 Employers Nationwide Accept Industrial Codes</p>
<p>The Government Further Seeks to Expand the Scope of Bank Lending</p>
<p>Child Labor Abolished Itself Due to Increased Wages</p>
<p>Havas, Washington, one day. The Chairman of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, with the approval of President Roosevelt, issued a letter to the banks, advocating that bank funds should be lent to private individuals instead of being stored in the treasury, stating that only by expanding the policy of lending can work be increased and prosperity restored. He also said that the Reconstruction Finance Corporation has lent $710,000,000, which has now been repaid in full.</p>
<p>Guomin News Agency, Washington, one day. Child labor, which the US Congress had been deliberating on for twenty-five years but failed to abolish, now has no place to stand because the US President has stipulated the minimum wage in the Industrial Code. From today onwards, it is practically a relic of history. Most of the credit for this abolition should be given to the wife of Pennsylvania Governor Pinchot. Mrs. Pinchot has been advocating the abolition of child labor for ten years. She has collected the tragic conditions of child laborers enslaved in Pennsylvania textile factories and called on women in other states to jointly demand the abolition of child labor. Now she has prepared a report and submitted it to US President Roosevelt, who decided to abolish child labor. However, if a federal law is made, it will be difficult to implement due to conflicts with the Constitution. Therefore, the minimum wage stipulated in the Industrial Code has been revised, which is enough to prevent employers from using child labor, making it abolish itself. As for the suffering of child laborers, according to reports received by the Industrial Recovery Administration, they often work 50 to 75 hours a week, and their weekly wages are only from 63 cents to 5 yuan, which is vastly different from the minimum wage of 12-13 yuan stipulated this time. They are often beaten in the factory. Often, young girls are dismissed because of resentment over being beaten.</p>
<p>Havas, Washington, two days. Although some employers have resisted the voluntary Industrial Code and some strikes and disturbances have occurred in some places, the initial results of the implementation of the Industrial Code seem to be very satisfactory. The government can be said to have achieved its wishes. There are currently 700,000 employers, representing one-sixth of American industry, who have participated in the National Industrial Recovery Act proposed by President Roosevelt in various ways. By the beginning of September, there will be about 6 million employees who can reduce working hours and increase wages at the same time. The blue eagle logo of joining the "National Industrial Recovery Program" is posted everywhere. In New York, there are 6,000 factories and stores that have posted this logo on their doors and windows. President Roosevelt has appointed 600 people to direct the recovery movement, engage in publicity, and urge employers to join. In addition, those who refuse to comply will have their goods boycotted. However, General Johnson, the drafter of the Economic Recovery Plan, does not want to implement boycotts at this time so that employers who refuse to comply can reflect. If they still do not comply by the second half of June, they will be boycotted. This is because some employers are taking advantage of existing production conditions to compete in trade, until the last moment, while some employers, who initially accepted Roosevelt's application to reduce hours and increase wages, are unable to compete with them as a result. Therefore, it is necessary to take boycott measures against those who refuse to comply. The areas where resistance to this concept of economic policy is most obvious are New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, Vermont, and Maine.</p>
<p>Havas Agency, New York, one day. The implementation of the Industrial Code from today onwards can be called a real economic revolution, especially because economic freedom is an essential element of American life. Now, all economic forces in agriculture, industry, and commerce, with a total capital of hundreds of millions, are concentrated in a heated struggle to restore economic prosperity. In principle, business people are free to accept or reject the code. However, if they do not accept it, they will be classified as undesirable elements and will inevitably encounter major difficulties with their workers, and even major social disturbances may occur. The characteristics of the code are to reduce working hours, that is, 35 hours per week, increase wages, and prohibit child labor. This measure increases costs and also raises selling prices. Some industrialists are already worried that their products will be too expensive to sell. Therefore, the result of this experiment will depend on the prosperity of each industry. If the commercial recovery phenomenon before President Roosevelt's plan continues to advance, then the code plan will succeed through the natural trend of economic forces. Otherwise, major difficulties may occur. However, President Roosevelt, on the one hand, is given broad freedom of action by Congress, and on the other hand, is cheered by the people, so he is very hopeful that his plan will achieve results.</p>

<h3>Expansion of Miners' Strike in the US</h3>
<p>A dispatch from Reuter's in New York on the first reports that the mining strike within the state of Pennsylvania is becoming increasingly serious. In the city of Ening, strikers clashed with police, with both sides opening fire, resulting in six injuries. In Big Stone City, two people were injured, and another two were affected by tear gas released by the police. Governor Binshaw summoned the chairman of the coal mining company and representatives of the workers for negotiations, but the chairman refused to attend. In Brown City, there are 20,000 unemployed workers, and there is a risk of the mining strike expanding. In addition, a milk industry strike in New York State has led the authorities to dispatch troops to various villages and towns to maintain order. A dispatch from Reuter's in Brownville, Pennsylvania, reports that a case occurred today in the coal mining area between striking picketers and the deputy district chief, resulting in sixteen people being sent to the hospital due to the effects of tear gas. The strike, which was initiated for the strict recognition of labor unions in the anthracite coal region, is gradually spreading, with 30,000 miners participating. It is feared that several more mines will soon go on strike. The center of the disturbance is currently the Fayette district, where an armed conflict occurred several days ago, resulting in one death and ten injuries. As a result, the governor has declared martial law, and 300 defense soldiers with rifles and machine guns are maintaining order in the area.</p>

The entire population of Toulon will participate in the exercises to test the effectiveness of passive defense. (Dispatch from Reuter's on the second)</p>
<h3>Japanese Government Is Paranoid</h3>
<h3>Ministry of Foreign Affairs Cracks Down on Foreign Spies</h3>
<p>Since Japan's withdrawal from the League of Nations, the issue of foreign spies has suddenly emerged. Recently, suspicious foreigners have been buying secret documents, photographing fortress zones, or attempting to learn about air defense exercise plans in various parts of Japan, irritating the authorities. Mr. Urasla, the father of Claus, the third secretary of the embassy of a certain country who caused problems last time, and the director of the St. Luke's Hospital in the United States, has recently sailed his own yacht back and forth in the fortress zone of the third district of Hayama several times. Despite repeated warnings from the Japanese authorities, he ignored them and continued to sail. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has decided to issue a serious warning and take decisive measures. This afternoon at 2 o'clock, the chiefs of the European and American, Chinese, Soviet, and American sections held an important meeting to discuss appropriate measures.

<h3>After Mahatma Gandhi's Arrest</h3>
<h3>Escorted to Pune</h3>
<p>Comrades Deeply Concerned that Gandhi Will Fast Again</p>
<p>Authorities Take Precautions, Only Minor Disturbances in Various Places</p>
<p>)Government Issues Statement Explaining Reason for Arrest(</p>
<p>Whether Gandhi will undertake a final fast to death to achieve the beauty of martyrdom is the question of the day. Many of Gandhi's comrades fear that he will take this action after his arrest. Aside from small-scale boycotts in Bombay and Ahmedabad, there have been very few disturbances elsewhere. This may be partly due to the strict precautions taken by the authorities, but it also proves that people within the National Congress generally do not approve of Gandhi's recent challenge to the government, believing that he is deliberately entering prison and a political dead end. Some newspapers criticize Gandhi's new plan of individual non-violent resistance to the government, calling it "national suicide." It is possible that someone will organize a new national organization and attempt to use constitutional procedures to counter the Indian National Congress. Gandhi has now been escorted to Pune and will likely be released there, but with restrictions on his stay in Pune. It is expected that Gandhi will not comply, and if he does not, he will be subjected to a public trial and potentially sentenced to two years of ordinary political imprisonment. Today, the Indian government issued a statement explaining the reasons for Gandhi's arrest and cited Gandhi's own words to prove his attitude towards non-violent opposition. The government believes that there is no difference between mass resistance and individual resistance, and that Gandhi's desire to implement individual non-violent resistance will inevitably lead to mass non-violent resistance, and the unfortunate consequences of the past will likely be seen again.

<p>Last night in the waiting room of the train station in Rotterdam, Holland, hundreds of Chinese people clashed. Initially, a certain German film company hired 250 Chinese people as actors to film the Sino-Japanese conflict incident and transported them to Berlin on a special train. Other Chinese people attempted to dissuade their hired compatriots with patriotic sentiments, resulting in arguments, followed by fights, with both sides using chairs to strike each other, causing serious injuries to two people. After police intervention, order was restored, and four people were arrested. The train was still able to depart on time. (Dispatch from Reuter's on the second)</p>

<p>The French Ambassador, Wei Lidun, came to Nanjing this morning to discuss the Sino-French Vietnamese Commercial Treaty. The treaty was signed in the 19th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1930], but has not been implemented due to numerous minor issues that have not been resolved. One of the more difficult points is the issue of tariff rates, which should follow the most-favored-nation treatment. However, now that our country has implemented new tariff rates, negotiations have become even more difficult. This matter will be the focus of discussion. (Special Dispatch on the second)</p>

<h3>Japan's Guiding Principles for India Conference</h3>
<p>(Dentsu, Tokyo, 2nd) In order to determine the final countermeasure for the Japanese-Indian conference held in Simla, India, the first six-chiefs meeting was held at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at 10:00 a.m. today. The attendees included Kurisu, Director of the Trade Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Sawada, Representative, Kuriyama, Director of the Treaty Bureau, Minister Kawashima, Nakajima, Director of the Tax Bureau of the Ministry of Finance, Takeuchi, Director of the Public Works Bureau of the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, Terauchi, Representative, and other relevant officials from the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Takuwumu Communications. Director Kurisu reported on the negotiations between the British and Japanese authorities, explaining that it would be difficult for the British and Indian representatives to have diplomatic negotiating powers, and that the situation would require substantive conflict in Simla, followed by final attestation in London. In particular, the British argument for the abolition of the British-Japanese Treaty of Commerce has now emerged, so the situation is extremely serious. Afterwards, each province expressed its opinion, and the meeting adjourned at 2:00 p.m. After the adjournment, Director Kurisu released the results of the report as follows: The results of the negotiations with the British and Indian governments will be reported to the six-province meeting, and in the future, either a full meeting of the six chiefs will be convened, or each province will consult separately to collect the opinions of the government. Whether the British government will grant diplomatic negotiating power to the Indian representative is still unanswered by the British side, so this meeting did not discuss it.</p>
<p>(Dentsu, Tokyo, 2nd) As a result of repeated consultations between the Textile Federation Chairman Kawabe and Director Kamisaka regarding the Japanese-Indian and British-Japanese Association Meetings, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Commerce and Industry, it was decided that the British attitude was ambiguous in the British-Japanese consultation, and it was impossible to prejudge. However, it can no longer be delayed. It was decided to send four representatives, Miyake Okada, Miura Kawaguchi, from Yokohama to the United States on the 11th via the Chichibu Maru. As for the Japanese-Indian conference, there is still considerable time until the 24th of the representatives' departure. Depending on the selection of British representatives, Japan will also decide to send leading figures in the industry if necessary.</p>

The scope of negotiation is limited to cotton, silk, and cotton cloth, which must be determined by number.

If the Private Association Meeting requires the assistance of the two countries, the government will be happy to provide assistance, but its decisions cannot bind the freedom of the government.</p>
<h3>Russia Detains Another Japanese Fishing Boat</h3>

<h3>Japanese Bureaucrats Fight for Territory</h3>
<p>(China United, Tokyo, 2nd) The Japanese Seiyukai and Minseito parties have recently been fiercely competing over the issue of colonial official transfers. The two parties have long been fighting for territory in the colonies. Whenever a governor is transferred, his main subordinates are also transferred at the same time. The officials in each colony, in order to be loyal to their masters, do their best to exploit the people's wealth in their territory and contribute to the political parties to which they belong. The Seiyukai is even more so. In August of last year, when Minister of Colonial Affairs Nagai wanted to transfer a senior official in Taiwan, the Seiyukai made a big fuss with the government. In order to take care of the overall situation, Saito ordered Minister of Colonial Affairs Nagai to suspend the transfer, and the political dispute subsided. This time, he wants to transfer a senior colonial official again, which has caused a head-on conflict between Minister of Communications Nanti and Minister of Education Hatoyama and Minister of Colonial Affairs Nagai. Each is supported by his own party, and the conflict is gradually intensifying. How Saito will deal with it is a fact that is worthy of attention.</p>
<h3>Unsettled Situation in Cuba</h3>
<p>(National, Santiago de Cuba, 1st) (Telegram from Cuba) It was hoped that the situation in Cuba could gradually stabilize after the opposition party and the Cuban government opened a meeting under the mediation of the U.S. Ambassador, and all political prisoners were released a few days ago. However, the disturbances of the opposition party in various places in the interior continue unabated, and today there are communist disturbances in the large southern towns. It turns out that there are quite a few communists among the released political prisoners. When these people returned to their villages, the communists welcomed them enthusiastically and wanted to hold a demonstration. The soldiers and police stopped them, and a conflict arose. Today, a 17-year-old girl here was shot and killed. She had just been released from prison. When the communists heard of her death, they were very angry and feared that there would be further disturbances.</p>
<h3>Hungarian Prime Minister Announces</h3>
<h3>Results of Talks in Rome</h3>
<p>)National, Buda, 2nd( Hungarian Prime Minister Sposi recently gave a broadcast speech, which is now published in various newspapers. His main points were the equality and revision of treaties, saying briefly: "The Hungarian government has made great achievements in political domestic affairs. The Hungarian issue is now attracting the attention of European countries. Hungary is no longer despised and now occupies an important position in European policy. This visit to Rome, Berlin, and Vienna not only created valuable economic relations and benefited the Hungarian market, but also greatly contributed to Hungary's foreign policy and its demands for treaty equality and revision. Italian Prime Minister Mussolini's great achievements in European peace will not only be praised by historians, but are already praised by everyone in the world." Later, he mentioned Germany, saying, "He personally strongly advocates establishing amicable relations with Germany."</p>

<h3>Rampant Kidnappings in the US</h3>
<h3>Authorities Confer on Eliminating Methods</h3>
<p>Havas, Hyde Park, New York, USA, 1st - President Roosevelt and Deputy Secretary of State, Professor Moller, today conferred on methods to stop kidnapping and extortion. Mr. [Moller] is a crime expert. People here attach great importance to the meeting of Roosevelt and the three. It is heard that President Roosevelt intends to establish a federal police bureau, whose organization is similar to the British "Scotland Yard" (ie, the London Police Department) and closely cooperates with the police authorities of various states.</p>
<p>Reuter, New York, 1st - The authorities are quite concerned about the recurring kidnappings in the country. New York Governor Lehman today recommended to the state legislature that families who privately pay money to redeem hostages be severely punished. The police authorities in Baltimore have requested the police authorities in Maryland to conduct a thorough investigation of two suspicious vehicles, as the two vehicles seem to be related to the case of the kidnapping of a young woman in Baltimore. The name of the young woman has not yet been released. The oil tycoon, Mr. Hill, who was recently released from the bandit's den, returned to Oklahoma City today. He had been trapped in the bandit's den for nine days and is in good condition, but he is unwilling to talk about being kidnapped. Regarding the case of kidnapping John O'Connell, a man named Stirle was arrested today pending trial because he had negotiated ransom matters with the kidnappers on behalf of John's family. It is heard that John's ransom was 140,000 US dollars.</p>
<h3>Research on Animal Sleeping Habits</h3>
<p>Reuter's, Nice, France - The sleeping habits of various animals are different. Mackerel continue to swim while sleeping. Ants open their eyes, yawn, and stretch, just like humans. Robins sing even while sleeping. Elephants sleep standing up, first leaning on one foot, and then changing to the other foot. A certain French naturalist has studied this for many years and knows a lot about the sleeping habits of animals. The above are just a few examples.</p>
<h3>War Zone Takeover Personnel Actually Controlled by Japanese Troops</h3>
<p>Reaching</p>
<p>Every move is restricted by the Japanese army</p>
<p>Hope for the takeover of Yuguan, Dushan, and Xinglong is lost</p>
<p>Special dispatch from Beiping: Since the start of the war zone takeover, most of it has been in name only. The takeover is declared complete, but in reality, it is restricted by the Japanese army everywhere, as if there had been no takeover. Apart from the puppet troops entrenched in various counties, the Japanese army has not withdrawn from Luan East and North Hebei. The Japanese army in Luan East, regarding our takeover personnel, has not only put forward all kinds of unreasonable demands under the guise of protecting the country but also refused to take over Yuguan. The takeover personnel were forced to retreat, only taking over Haiyang Town, which the Japanese pointed to as the location of the Linyu County Office. They refused to take over everything east of the Shi River, all the way to Yuguan. Yin Tong and others traveled between Beiping and Tianjin, running between the authorities and the Japanese garrison commander, negotiating without any progress. The county magistrate of Linyu County can only live in peace in one corner of Haiyang Town. The old city of Linyu County, with Guanshan in sight, is occupied by squatters, and restoration is nowhere in sight. The two counties of Miyun and Huairou in the northern route took great pains, and finally, they were taken over separately the day before yesterday. However, all actions are under the control of Suzuki, the commander of the Japanese army brigade stationed in Miyun. The facts are as follows: 1) The handover of the old and new county magistrates was supervised by Suzuki's personnel. 2) The police chief's pistol was confiscated by the Japanese army on the pretext of not being reported. 3) The number of police officers and guns were all inspected by the Japanese army. 4) The newly appointed Miyun County magistrate, Sun Shutang, was ordered by Suzuki to live in his headquarters, and Japanese military police followed him in and out, ostensibly for protection, but actually for surveillance. 5) The county government's employment of personnel must be approved by the Japanese army, and all urban and rural administrative personnel cannot be freely changed. Observing from the above situation, what exactly is being taken over in this so-called takeover? Although these administrative personnel are nominally dispatched by our side, how are they different from being puppets of the Japanese army? This is the case in Miyun, and it is the same in all other counties where the Japanese army is stationed. The authorities are currently negotiating with the Japanese side on this matter, hoping that they will respect the spirit of the truce agreement and not interfere in administration. It is still difficult to predict what will happen in the future. As for the two counties of Xinglong and Dushan, most of them are outside the Great Wall, and there is no hope of takeover. Qian'an is also occupied by mixed puppet troops, and it is difficult to take over for a while. The counties of Zunhua and Jixian are still in the process of negotiation for takeover. Although the county magistrate of Jixian has already gone there, he has still not been able to take over.</p>
<p>Although the Japanese army within the Luan East and North Hebei war zones has stated that they will withdraw to the Great Wall line in accordance with the truce agreement, Suzuki stationed in Miyun and Hattori stationed in Shanhaiguan have recently said that most of the troops can be withdrawn, but in order to monitor the Chinese side's implementation of the truce agreement, a small number of troops will be stationed in important areas in Miyun and Luan East for monitoring. If so, the Japanese army in the war zone has not withdrawn at all, and the disputes within the war zone in the future will be endless. (August 1st)</p>

<h3>Heavily Defeat Bandit He in Western Hubei</h3>
<p>Wuyangguan recaptured in bloody battle</p>
<p>Bandit Reds in Eastern Hubei have collapsed and retreated</p>
<p>Correspondence from Hankou: Since Xu Yuanquan ordered the total suppression of the remaining bandits of He Long in western Hubei, they have been gradually unable to hold on after more than ten battles, large and small. Hefeng and Wufeng have been successively recovered by Xu's army. Xu's plan for suppression was originally divided into three stages: the first stage was to attack Hefeng to gain a geographical advantage; the second stage was to attack Wuyangguan to directly attack the bandit's nest; and the third stage was to eliminate the scattered bandits to completely eliminate the remaining evils. With the occupation of Hefeng, the first stage of the mission was completed. Xu then issued the second general attack order. The various important places such as Shihuiyao, Hongtuxi, Ximaping, and Guanyinping were also captured separately by the various troops of Zhang Gang, Jiang Zuojun, Xu Jiwu, and Pan Shanzhai. The battle of Ximaping was especially fierce, and the pseudo 7th Division was almost completely wiped out. The various armies took advantage of the victory to encircle and suppress He's bandit's nest, Wuyangguan. He's bandits were extremely anxious due to the loss of most of their main force, so they vented their anger on Ye Guangji, the commander of the pseudo 7th Division, for his ineffective combat, and shot him dead. Lu Dongsheng was appointed to succeed as the division commander, but Lu was also killed for the defeat at Ximaping, and the morale of the bandits became more and more scattered. Those who guarded Wuyangguan were only He's bandits themselves, and the pseudo-army commander Xia Zhi, and his trusted guard regiment, while the rest fled elsewhere. Because the pass was steep, they were still able to hold on. Xu Yuanquan regarded this place as the main nest of He's bandits and strictly ordered the various armies to recapture it within three days. On the 27th of last month, the various troops of Zhang, Jiang, Xu, and Pan jointly launched a fierce attack on the pass, fighting fiercely with He's bandits in the pass for two days and two nights. On the 29th, Xu Jiwu's brigade fought hard and broke through the pass, bravely being the first to ascend. The bandits' solid fortifications were completely destroyed by artillery fire. He's bandits knew that they could no longer defend, so they broke through to the northwest with Xia Zhi and retreated to Jiaoliuping. The various brigades of Xu and Zhang set out overnight. According to a telegram from the 1st, Jiaoliuping has been surrounded. The areas originally occupied by He's bandits are all famous and dangerous places, and the area also accounts for two-fifths of western Hubei. Jiaoliuping is not recorded on the map, and it is certainly not as dangerous as Wuyangguan. Judging from the situation, they are likely to break through again and flee into the border areas of Sichuan and Hunan, otherwise, if they are trapped in an isolated army, they will inevitably be annihilated. According to reports, there are two reasons why He's bandits have repeatedly occupied western Hubei: 1) They take advantage of their familiarity with the terrain, making it easy to resist the government troops; 2) They take advantage of the people's ignorance, making it easy to call on the masses. There are also two reasons for this failure: 1) After a long period of blockade, materials are extremely scarce, and there is no place to replenish weapons and ammunition; 2) They are severely treated and the people are scattered, and many lower-level cadres do not listen to He's bandits' commands, and the coerced and foolish people are even more eager to extricate themselves in time. The collapse in one battle is not accidental. The remaining bandits in eastern Hubei have been suppressed by the various troops of Liang Guanying, Sun Lianzhong, Peng Zhenshan, Shangguan Yunxiang, and Hao Mengling in various ways for several days. The pseudo 25th Army suffered the most damage. The pseudo 24th and 28th Armies also simultaneously knew that the border areas of Henan and Anhui were defeated by the National Army. There is no detailed report on the remaining strength, and the number of people who fled to eastern Hubei is no more than 4,000. In addition to dividing the area and assigning the various armies to encircle them separately, Liu Zhenhua recently appointed Gu Ying, Yi Benying, and Zheng Jiankui to serve as the guerrilla commanders of the first, second, and third routes in the border area, respectively, to carry out guerrilla warfare. Liu is also concurrently promoting politics. The Huangchuan Conference was convened to plan for the aftermath of the bandit area. The conference opened on the 28th of last month and closed on the 30th. Fan Xiji, the director of the Hubei Security Office, Cheng Ruhai, the administrative commissioner of the fourth district, Gu Renfa, the administrative commissioner of the third district, Hua Wenxuan, the county magistrate of Huangpi, and Jiang Zhangji, the county magistrate of Lishan, returned to Hankou on the 1st of this month. According to Fan, the meeting decided on three major policies regarding the aftermath of the bandit area: 1) Relieving the refugees, setting up shelters for them, and providing emergency relief; 2) Reforming the captured bandits, making them repent, and turning the bad into good; 3) Arming immigrants, implementing land distribution, and the third item is especially important, because the reason why the bandits call on the masses is the issue of land distribution, and this is a targeted remedy. A land distribution method has been formulated, roughly based on the local farmers who have already armed themselves, such as the volunteer team, the security team, and the militia team, to form the "Revival Rural Defense Team," with one hundred people as a team and five hundred people as a brigade, under the command of the border area commander-in-chief. The work steps are: 1. Assisting the army in clearing the bandits; 2. Harvesting the grain in the bandit area; 3. Building bunkers and fortified villages to strengthen self-defense. Then, according to the land distribution method, land is distributed according to the number of people, and reclamation is implemented, in order to cure both the symptoms and the root causes. After Fan arrived in Hankou, he attended the provincial government meeting on the same day, reported on the Huangchuan Conference, and raised the issue of education in the bandit area. The provincial government decided that the education department should draft a plan to reform education in the bandit area and convene a meeting of the county magistrates of eastern Hubei on the 2nd to discuss the aftermath of the bandit area, reform education, and unify government orders. In addition to Cheng Ruhai, the county magistrate of Huang'an, Hua Wenxuan, the county magistrate of Huangpi, and Jiang Zhangji, the county magistrate of Lishan, Zhu Zhishan, the county magistrate of Huanggang, and Zheng Zhong, the county magistrate of Macheng, were also telegraphed to come to the province to participate. Zhang Qun, the chairman of the provincial government, Meng Guangpeng, the director of the civil affairs department, and Fan Xiji, the director of the security office, will also attend and give instructions at that time. The meeting is scheduled for one day, and may be extended if necessary. (August 1st)</p>
<h3>Important People and Celebrities of Guling</h3>

<p>Restoring the Bailudong Academy</p>
<p>Correspondence from Guling: The climate this year is relatively hot, and there are many tourists. The meeting closed a few days ago, and many important people from various parties have not yet gone down the mountain.

Wang Yitang and others signed up to initiate the proposal, with the main purpose of promoting culture, organizing academics, and revitalizing national spirit. Finally, Huang Ying from the Propaganda Committee of the Central Committee of the Kuomintang, accompanied by a photographer, produced a moving picture film to record the grand event.

<p>Correspondence from Anqing: In the second district of Dongxiang, Qianshan County, Anhui Province, more than ten miles away from the county seat in Fengjiagang, a large ancient city was discovered in early last month. A shepherd boy accidentally saw a small hole and probed it with his shepherd's whip, which fell down. He found it very strange and probed the bottom with a long pole, which also fell down, and there was a hollow sound, as if it was connected. Even stranger, he stirred up the nearby residents, who all went to dig with hoes. Suddenly, it collapsed, and the opening of the hole was about eight square feet. Those who were curious climbed down a ladder to explore the truth. The city wall was clearly visible, and the doors were wide, and four or five people could walk in and out side by side. The scale of the building was even more exquisite than modern times. It is said that brick marks have been exposed around the ground for a long time, but no one paid attention to it before it was discovered. After careful observation inside and out by ordinary people, it is obviously a large city. According to the county chronicles of the county, it is recorded that this place was where Cao Cao stationed troops during the Three Kingdoms period. When asked about the residents of the area, what they said was the same as the county chronicles, and they also said that a large knife was found five years ago and still exists. This proves that it must be a magnificent building in the past. The Provincial Library, according to a letter from Sun Jun and others from the academic circles of the second district of the county, specially requested the Education Department to handle it. The Education Department has already telegraphed the county magistrate of the county, Huang Xinyan, to go to the place as soon as possible, investigate in detail and report it, and immediately send people to protect it properly, and do not allow the people to excavate it privately, and report it within three days of the arrival of the document, so that it can be investigated and decided.

<h3>Feng Ziyou's Letter to the Sun Yat-sen Culture and Education Center</h3>
<p>Discussing Matters of Soliciting Biographies</p>
<p>Historical Materials Should Be Collected First</p>
<p>So That Those Who Respond to the Solicitation Have a Standard</p>
<p>News from Beijing: Feng Ziyou, a member of the Legislative Yuan, wrote a letter to the Sun Yat-sen Culture and Education Center, saying: "To the Directors of the Sun Yat-sen Culture and Education Center, I have read in the newspapers that you have recently offered a reward for soliciting biographies of Sun Yat-sen. The grand plan is deeply admired. However, this matter is of great importance. As far as I know, Sun Yat-sen's life and career, whether big or small, are deeply related to the revolution and saving the country. The places planned were not in one place, and the comrades who participated were not one person. If the relevant people who were present in each battle are not gathered together to share what they know and verify each other, it will be difficult to become a credible history. There are about three kinds of books published in recent years that can be used as a reference for the biography. One is Mr. Hu Zhan's Complete Biography of the Prime Minister, the second is the History of the Kuomintang compiled by the Minzhi Bookstore, and the third is my own History of the Revolution Before the Founding of the Republic of China. The Complete Biography only records correspondence and does not describe the facts. The History of the Kuomintang is a hodgepodge of books with many errors. My book contains materials mostly taken from my notes of following Sun Yat-sen for thirty years and old drafts from the China Daily in Hong Kong. Only the upper and middle volumes have been published so far, and the lower volume still needs to be collected and verified before it can be published. Now, what will you use as a blueprint for this move? Is it that the books that have been published now are sufficient for full material and there is no need to collect them? This is indeed a question worth studying. Looking at the Compilation Committee of Party History of the Central Committee of the Kuomintang, it has been established for many years, and the number of authors recruited cannot be said to be small, and the collection of historical materials cannot be said to be weak, but the results obtained are few. It is said that last year there was an attempt to edit the Prime Minister's Chronology. The first draft was printed and distributed not long ago, and it was criticized by various old comrades. Mr. Hu Zhan even made a fierce criticism in the Three People's Principles Monthly. As a result, the chronology has not been published to this day. This is also what you should pay special attention to. In my humble opinion, before the historical materials are ready, we should first collect them, and then publish them to the world after we have collected them, so that those who respond to the solicitation have a standard, which is enough to verify the facts and spread them permanently. If we rush to write a biography at this time, I am afraid that we will miss a lot of things, which will be counterproductive, and it is definitely not possible to complete this masterpiece in this short period of time. This move is a grand event for your Museum to start a career. Please consider it carefully and avoid repeating the mistakes of the first draft of the Chronology. I cannot express my hope enough." It is heard that after receiving the letter, the Museum immediately replied, saying, "This biography is not compiled by the Museum itself, so except for those who conflict with the principles or have factual errors, the rest can be free from restraint."</p>
<h3>Shantou Financial Panic Again</h3>
<p>Due to the Cancellation of Expired White Tickets</p>
<p>Exchange Rate Discount of Forty Yuan per Thousand Yuan</p>
<p>Correspondence from Shantou: Before the Dragon Boat Festival this year, Shantou's financial situation once caused a major panic. More than one hundred pawnshops and large shops went bankrupt, owing more than 2 million yuan in debts. Bankruptcies of large shops in the Chaoshan and Meizhou counties have also been heard from time to time. The reasons are roughly as follows: 1) Due to the sluggish situation in Southeast Asia, fewer overseas Chinese remit money back to the country, and the purchasing power of rural people is weak, so the Chaoshan and Meizhou trade is sluggish. 2) Due to the endless stream of exorbitant taxes and levies, the government allocates various public bonds, voluntary bonds, road construction fees, and security team expenses, which are endless, and the people are extremely exhausted and unable to bear the burden. 3) The place is not peaceful, and the effectiveness of the law is weak. It is difficult for industry and commerce to develop. Government-run businesses cannot easily gain the trust of the people and give them assistance. Overseas Chinese are even less willing to invest in the motherland. 4) Domestic goods and local products are destroyed by taxes and additional burdens, and foreign goods take the opportunity to flow in and dump them. Last year, the Shantou Customs statistics showed that imported goods exceeded four million taels. The money earned by the people's sweat and blood flows out continuously, year after year, how can it not be exhausted? Based on these four reasons, the extremely panic financial situation of today has been created. For the sake of temporary emergency relief, the Shantou City Chamber of Commerce Exchange Silver Industry Association formulated a method to uniformly collect half and transfer half of the due deposit slips, and also issued two kinds of joint guarantee white tickets and property guarantee white tickets from various banks, which were used as cash and used in the market. In the past two months, almost the entire city has become a world of white ticket banknotes. At that time, the interest rate had been stipulated by the Chamber of Commerce for the silver industry to be 15% per day, and for miscellaneous industries to be 20%. Because there was no interest to be gained, unscrupulous merchants secretly smuggled cash out of the country, and the methods were very clever. In order to maintain the financial situation, the City Chamber of Commerce asked the government to strictly prohibit the export of cash, and each person leaving Shantou was not allowed to carry more than twenty yuan in their luggage. At the same time, the Provincial Bank and the Bank of China implemented mortgage loans to facilitate circulation. Because of this, land prices in the city plummeted. Those that were formerly worth 10,000 yuan in the commercial district have fallen to 6,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Those outside the city have fallen to 7,000 or 8,000 yuan. At that time, the Provincial Bank issued a large number of banknotes, and on the one hand, transported the absorbed cash to the Guangzhou head office for storage. The Silver Industry Association filed a complaint with the City Chamber of Commerce and questioned the Provincial Bank. According to the bank's reply, due to the excessive amount of silver stored, it was ordered by the head office to transport it to the provincial treasury for storage. At that time, it was very profitable to transport cash to other ports, and unscrupulous merchants secretly exported it, such as the seventeen boxes seized by the Public Security Bureau last year, all of which were transported to the province and confiscated, worth about 100,000 yuan. Usually, the total amount of cash circulating in Shantou City is about 6 million yuan. According to the investigation this month, excluding the Bank of China and the Provincial Bank, only more than 1.5 million silver coins are circulating in the city, supplemented by more than 4 million banknotes. Because the city imports a lot of goods, cash must be remitted to pay the bills. Since cash cannot be taken out, and banknotes are not circulated in other ports, the exchange rate has increased sharply. The discount for every thousand yuan remitted to Shanghai was at most 10 to 20 yuan in the past, but now it costs 40 yuan. Recently, the property guarantee white tickets and the joint guarantee white tickets have expired (originally scheduled for two months, about 1.5 million yuan), and the call to cancel the white tickets is very strong. If they are cancelled, a huge amount of cash must be prepared. Now the commercial market is sluggish, property prices are falling, and the economy is stagnant. It is really not easy to prepare this sum of more than 1 million cash. Therefore, the financial market has shown extreme panic again in recent days. Also, a part of the merchants are secretly carrying out a rent reduction movement. There are already more than 300 participants, and they plan to submit a request to the Eastern District Appeasement Office and the Municipal Government, asking the landlords to reduce rents in order to maintain business. The landlords are also largely united. If the tenants propose rent reduction conditions, the government's voluntary bonds and the monthly rent donations and police donations allocated in the middle of the year should be fully borne by the landlords. This memorial is also being drafted. This financial panic will inevitably cause a major dispute between the city's tenants and landlords.</p>
<p>The Yellow River Water Level in Shandong Province is Still Rising</p>
<p>—River Works Not Optimistic—</p>
<p>Correspondence from Jinan: The situation in Lishengdun in the upper reaches of the Yellow River was dangerous two days ago. Zhang Lianjia, the director of the River Affairs Bureau, has telegraphed Shi, the county magistrate of Juye County, to purchase 200,000 catties of materials within five days and hand them over to Chen Wenmo, the chief of the upper reaches section, for emergency protection. Sun Xifeng, the counselor of the Provincial Government, inspected and accepted the materials on the 31st. Although the situation there has not changed in the past two days, according to a telegram obtained by the River Affairs Bureau on the 31st, the water level in the Lishengdun River has risen by another 1.3 cm, the source is still strong, and the water is high and flowing fast. However, the middle and lower reaches are falling.</p>

<p>[Songjiang&gt; Reviewing the Case of Encroachment on Sun Yat-sen Forest</p>
<p>The Yuhuangge area in this city was originally a piece of wasteland. In the past, it was decided by local public opinion to open it up as Sun Yat-sen Park. In previous Tomb-sweeping Days, various agencies planted trees here. In the past, the Construction Bureau circled the location and designated it as Sun Yat-sen Forest, with drawings on file. Recently, the Shatian Bureau sold a lot of land in the area, which was heard by the county government. The agricultural extension office manager was instructed to thoroughly investigate the forest land encroached in the forest farm, verify it correctly, draw detailed maps, and report it for review. The manager has reported it to the county, and today it was submitted to the county government meeting to discuss how to deal with it. It was decided to convene all parties involved in the relevant cases of the seventh administrative meeting to discuss the handling method on a scheduled meeting.</p>

<h3>Lawsuit Involving Cloth Store Partners Settled</h3>
<p>The Chengdai and Yuanshun cloth stores in the east gate of this county have been well-known establishments for over a hundred years. Since the lawsuit involving the partners began, it has attracted much attention from the community due to the extremely complex details. The case was recently heard by the Yin County District Court. The plaintiff, shareholder representative Yan Rui (Shen Luolan), sued manager Wang Hanzhi for the return of 5,000 silver dollars embezzled from the store and for the handover of store affairs. The reasons stated were sufficient, while the defendant, Wang Hanzhi, claimed that the money was special compensation that he deserved and did not provide concrete evidence. The precedents cited from former managers Zheng and Zhu also lacked factual proof. Therefore, the defendant was ordered to return the full amount, hand over his duties, and bear the litigation costs.</p>
<h3>Guard Steals Huge Sum of Money</h3>
<p>Yesterday (the 31st), Xu Huanqi, a lieutenant quartermaster of Zhang Luanji's 45th Brigade stationed in Wufu, and a guard came to Ningbo to withdraw over 20,000 silver dollars from a certain bank to purchase 2,000 bags of flour. He instructed them to deliver them to the Ningbo Station for transport. The remaining amount, about 10,000 silver dollars, was stored in a leather suitcase. In the afternoon at 4:00 p.m., Xu and others took a car back to Wufu. After Xu got on the bus, he leaned back and fell asleep since he had a guard with him. The guard saw the situation, suddenly had malicious intent, pried open the suitcase, stole five bundles of banknotes, totaling 5,000 silver dollars, and took the opportunity to escape. By the time Xu and others realized this, they urgently reported it to the military and police agencies for arrest, but there was no trace of him. The Ningbo military and police agencies received this telegram and conducted a thorough search when the 7:30 p.m. night train arrived at the station.</p>

<h3>Hurricane Approaching Shanghai</h3>
<p>If it Does Not Change Direction, Shanghai Will Bear the Brunt</p>
<p>Observatory Warns All Sectors on Land and Sea to Be Alert</p>
<p>According to the Shanghai Xujiahui Observatory, Shanghai is in the path of a severe hurricane. Its center is passing through the East China Sea and moving slowly northwest, only 300 miles from Shanghai. If it does not encounter high pressure that causes the hurricane to change direction temporarily, Shanghai may not be able to escape the disaster of a storm. However, observing this morning's weather, there is no sign of such high pressure descending for the time being. Therefore, the observatory has broadcasted a radio warning, alerting ships at sea and in the harbor to be prepared for strong cyclone rain with a force of 10. This cyclone rain is a harbinger of the hurricane. The time when the hurricane will pass through cannot be predicted in advance, but its center may reach Shanghai on Friday. The frequent changes in wind direction and strong winds encountered in Shanghai yesterday were caused by the hurricane. Therefore, Shanghai has already entered the hurricane zone. The wind and waves in the Yangtze River Estuary yesterday, and the appearance of lightning, are also precursors to the hurricane. This hurricane is very strong. If its center directly hits Shanghai, the losses suffered by ships and land could be significant.</p>
<p>The Xujiahui Observatory issued a strong wind warning yesterday morning. Various shipping companies in Shanghai have also notified their ships at sea via radio to pay attention. According to observatory statistics, 11 hurricanes have occurred this year, but none have hit Shanghai. Only on July 24th, the area of Tongzhou in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River was affected, but it passed quickly.</p>
<h3>Sun Ke Returned to Shanghai Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>Decided to Resolve the Situation Peacefully</p>
<p>Sun Negotiated with Li Liejun Yesterday</p>
<p>Feng Kewang Accepts Four Principles</p>
<p>Sun Ke, the President of the Legislative Yuan, returned to Shanghai yesterday morning at 8:00 a.m. on the night express train from Nanjing, in response to telegrams from Wang Jingwei and Chiang Kai-shek to participate in the Lushan Conference. Reporters from various newspapers interviewed him at his residence yesterday morning. According to Sun, the situation in Chahar will be resolved peacefully. The Lushan Conference discussed military and political issues, but not diplomatic issues. At 10:50 a.m. yesterday morning, Sun drove to visit Li Liejun and talked for half an hour before leaving. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Contents of the Lushan Conference</h3>
<p>Sun stated to reporters yesterday morning that the Lushan Conference did not discuss diplomatic issues. The scope of discussion included important political issues and military technical issues. Regarding political issues, a definite solution was proposed for the aftermath of the Xinjiang incident, and the province's newly appointed official was approved by the Executive Yuan. As for the solution to the Chahar situation, detailed information can be found in the joint telegram from Wang and Chiang. Other points were also agreed upon by Wang and Chiang.</p>
<h3>Implementing Peace</h3>
<p>Before the Lushan Conference, the Central Government took military action, advancing towards Chahar Province to urge Song Zheyuan to return to office and take over the administration of Chahar Province. But all parties are peaceful and use political methods to solve it. The Central Government, in order to avoid a situation where resistance against Japan ends in internal strife, decided to adopt this opinion and suspend military action temporarily. Now the Lushan Conference has established principles that Feng agrees to. Continue to discuss the end of military methods, such as the problems of local rehabilitation and the placement of troops. The Central Army's entry into Chahar is not because it is dissatisfied with Feng's resistance against Japan. Because Chahar is a central province, the Central Army's advance to take over the administration of Chahar Province and unify military power is not subject to any restrictions. The recovery of the lost territories of the four northeastern provinces will definitely not be accomplished by the strength of Chahar Province alone. It must fill the national strength, and only with concerted action can there be this hope.</p>
<h3>Reducing Provinces</h3>
<p>The issue of reducing provinces was not raised for discussion at the Lushan Conference. This cannot be realized in a short period of time. A detailed discussion should be added. The priority question should first pay attention to geography, human relations, and economics, so that after the province is reduced, the defense is consolidated, and political implementation increases strength, and the effect is immediately apparent without any drawbacks. Sun also said that the change in the provincial system is a very ordinary</p>
<p>thing. It has been seen many times in ancient times. As for the rumors that Xinjiang will be divided into three provinces, according to what I know, the area of ​​Xinjiang is larger than the three northeastern provinces. Although it is necessary to divide the provinces for governance, the land is vast and sparsely populated, with only 2 million residents. If the division of provinces is implemented, the financial resources will be insufficient, which will inevitably increase the burden on the people, so it will be difficult to implement it for a while.</p>
<h3>French Occupation of Nine Islands</h3>
<p>When asked how the Central Government will deal with the French occupation of the nine small islands, Sun said that according to the French authorities, the longitude of the location of the nine small islands does not match the Xisha Islands claimed by our country. Therefore, whether it is our territory is still questionable. However, considering its orientation and location, it is very similar to our Xisha Islands. Therefore, it is necessary to conduct on-site investigations to determine whether France deliberately misrepresented and forcibly occupied our land. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is currently conducting investigations. If it is found that it is indeed the Xisha Islands, we must protest to France to protect our territory.</p>
<h3>Visiting Li Liejun</h3>
<p>At 10:50 a.m. yesterday morning, Sun drove from his residence to Masnan Road to visit Li Liejun to discuss the Chahar situation. They talked for about half an hour before leaving. According to Li, Sun's visit was to discuss with me how to resolve the Chahar situation. It has now been decided that the intermediaries of both sides will conduct peaceful consultations, which should lead to a satisfactory solution. As for whether I will go north, it depends on the outcome of this negotiation. According to another source, Feng Kewang accepted four principles. It is reported that Sun will take a steamer to Qingdao in the next day or two to serve his mother.</p>

<h3>Yesterday's Public Farewell Banquet for Commander Dai</h3>
<p>Representatives of Three Groups Delivered Farewell Speeches Separately</p>
<p>Yu Qiaqing, Mu Ouchu, and Others Gave Speeches One After Another</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 7:00 p.m., the City Chamber of Commerce, the Local Association, and other groups held a grand farewell banquet for Commander Dai, who is taking office as the Director of the Civil Affairs Department of Fujian Province, on the grass of the Local Association on Jing'an Temple Road. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Guests of Honor</h3>
<p>The attendees included Garrison Commander Dai Ji, Chief of Staff Zhang Xiang, Secretary Xu Yiheng, and others, accompanied by Shi Liangcai, Du Yuesheng, Gu Xinyi, Huang Renzhi, Yu Zuoting, Mu Ouchu, Lin Kanghou, Yu Qiaqing, Chen Songyuan, Lu Wenshao, Ye Jiayu, Zha Liangzhao, Xu Kecheng, Tao Leqin, Nie Lusheng, Pan Xusheng, Pei Yunxiang, Yan Fuqing, Zou Bingwen, Lao Jingxiu, Zhang Xiaolin, Ma Jiliang, Li Zuzu, Fang Jiaobo, Hu Yunqiu, Zhao Ziqing, Lu Bohong, Ma Shaoquan, Li Zushen, Chu Huiseng, and others.</p>
<h3>Speech by the Chamber of Commerce</h3>
<p>Lu Wenshao of the City Chamber of Commerce gave a farewell speech first, saying: "Since the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-95, Fujian has lost all of its defenses except for Taiwan and Penghu, and has long been coveted by the Japanese. Therefore, the Qing Dynasty first had a covenant of non-cession. When the Twenty-One Demands were presented in the fourth year of the Republic (1915), our country yielded to the lewd power and included in the exchange of notes that Fujian was not allowed to operate shipyards and military ports by foreigners. The Taiwanese people who were asked for relied on their power to breed incidents. This is the foreign trouble. As for the internal affairs of Fujian Province, since Li Houji was in charge of Fujian, he has suffered from military redundancies and many bandits. Chen Guohui, Gao Yizhi and others occupy one side, collecting levies and lewdness. The people of Fujian have groaned under the lewd power for 20 years. The past Fujian Province is really no different from being in a situation of foreign troubles and internal worries, facing enemies on all sides. In terms of Fujian's geographical advantages, it produces sugar cane, camphor, and is rich in coal and iron. The Fujian people who live in foreign countries and become rich in business are also countless. Therefore, Fujian is rich in natural resources and does not lack capital. If the right person can manage it well, Fujian can shield the southeast and become an important town. Since the government took Chiang Kai-shek as the chief commander of the Fujian government, it has disbanded miscellaneous troops and wiped out bandits. It has improved compared with recent years. Recently, it has also recruited overseas Chinese to plan construction. This has aroused the jealousy of the Japanese. To resist foreign aggression, we must first settle the internal affairs. At this time, when the Tanggu Truce Agreement has just been signed, the generals who have contributed to the Anti-Japanese War have a sense of flesh regeneration. Since the Shanghai pseudo-inter-city special zone has experienced the January 28th Incident, the people have also temporarily stopped their military hearts. You are sitting in this town, and you actually feel quite relaxed. The government has been working with Chief Commander Jiang for many years. They are in harmony with each other. The transfer to the head of the Fujian Provincial Department of Civil Affairs will surely bring about the effect of harmony and mutual benefit. From now on, how to purify the officialdom and how to remove the harsh taxes depends on your planning. We wish the politics of Fujian Province to shine brightly in the shortest possible time. Although Shanghai has lost a virtuous envoy, Fujian has added a main defender. For the sake of the overall situation of the country, our association dare not indulge in the worldly so-called [blank] The selfishness of lying down on the tracks. I would like to express my deep wishes at the time of relying on the loading and waiting for departure. In the future, when the most returned report comes to Shanghai, we will have a cup of wine to express our parting feelings."</p>
<h3>Speech by the Association</h3>
<p>Shi Liangcai of the Local Association gave a speech, saying: "Today, the three groups are giving Commander Dai a farewell, and I have many feelings. After sending off Mayor Zhang, we are now sending off Commander Dai, which is really related to the Shanghai War last year. Commander Dai has been in Shanghai for more than a year, but he has been so simple that the citizens hardly know that there is a garrison headquarters and Commander Dai. The citizens have not forgotten him, because he has not insulted the citizens. Today's farewell shows that the citizens have not forgotten him. I hope that Commander Dai, the head of the Fujian Civil Affairs Department, will still let the people forget and not forget, not forget and forget. Last year, the 19th Route Army resisted Japan in Shanghai. Almost everyone knew Chiang and Cai, but not Commander Dai. In fact, Chiang and Cai killed the enemy in front, and Commander Dai directed behind. Their achievements are inseparable. Commander Dai's strength lies in the eight characters of 'not much to do when nothing happens, and not negligent when something happens'. Now Shanghai has lost a good commander, and Fujian has added a civil affairs director. This is what is called losing here and gaining there. In fact, there is nothing wrong with it. Therefore, I wish Commander Dai good health."</p>
<h3>Speech by the Banking Industry</h3>
<p>Pei Yunqing of the Money Industry Association delivered a farewell speech, saying: "The banking industry heard about Commander Dai's move, and urgently requested to participate to express their respect. They are also honored to be able to attend this grand event. I wish Commander Dai good health."</p>
<h3>Commander Dai's Reply</h3>
<p>Commander Dai replied, "I am very grateful and honored to receive the farewell from the City Chamber of Commerce, the Local Association, and the Money Industry Association. I have been in Shanghai for 20 months and have not made any achievements. I am very ashamed and dare not take on more compliments. I will never forget the assistance of your association and others during the Anti-Japanese War of the 19th Route Army. Although I am going to Fujian, I hope to provide assistance to make up for the deficiencies and borrow a cup to wish you all good health."</p>
<h3>Speeches by Yu and Mu</h3>
<p>)1( Yu Qiaqing said, "Because of the Shanghai War of the 19th Route Army, the world was shocked, and even the Japanese were convinced. According to a book written by a Japanese scholar of international law, there were 48 battles in the Shanghai War, and the Chinese side won 28 times. The last battle was the most amazing. Commander Dai has been stationed in Shanghai for 20 months and has not disturbed the people at all. It is really commendable. )2( After Yu finished his speech, Mu Ouchu took over. Just as he was about to start praising Commander Dai, it rained. He asked Commander Dai to also give the people rain when he was the Minister of Civil Affairs of Fujian. Later, Lin Kanghou and others gave speeches one after another, but the words are omitted.</p>
<p>German Pocket Cruiser</p>
<h3>The Cologne Sails to the Far East and Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>The Captain Pays a Visit to Local Chinese and Foreign Authorities</p>
<p>Mayor Wu is Scheduled to Host a Banquet on the 9th</p>
<p>Reporters Were Invited to Visit Yesterday</p>
<p>The Public is Welcome to Tour Next Monday</p>
<p>After the World War, Germany's military was restricted by the treaty, and naval restrictions were even stricter. The largest cruiser could not exceed 10,000 tons. In recent years, the German government has built "pocket cruisers." Four ships have been completed successively. The first ship, the Emden, arrived in Shanghai last year. Now the fourth ship, the Cologne, has also arrived in Shanghai. The captain of the ship invited reporters from Chinese and Western newspapers in Shanghai to visit the ship, and the captain also visited our municipal government authorities and naval leaders. It is now scheduled to leave Shanghai on the 14th and return home. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Sailing to the Far East</h3>
<p>The German government has built pocket cruisers, and there are currently (1) Emden, (2) Konsoloe, (3) Knespanl. The fourth ship is the Cologne. The ship was completed in the winter of last year. On November 8th, it was incorporated into the fleet. On December 8th, it was ordered by German President Hindenburg to depart from Germany and sail to the Far East, one to practice the Far East voyage, and one to connect with various countries. When Cologne left Germany, it was designated by the President to first go to Spain, then to Italy, through the Egyptian Mediterranean to India, then to the Dutch East Indies to Australia, then through the South Pacific Islands to Tasmania to Japan, then to Qingdao and then to Shanghai. It arrived in Shanghai at 9:00 a.m. yesterday and berthed in front of the Yangshupu Blue Road Pier.</p>
<h3>Visiting Guests in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Before Cologne arrived in Shanghai, it telegraphed the German Consul General in Shanghai to visit our country's authorities. Therefore, when the Cologne arrived in Shanghai, its captain, Lieutenant Colonel Schniewend,</p>
<p>Accompanied by his adjutant, took a small wheel ashore to visit Mayor Wu Tiecheng at the Municipal Government on Fenglin Bridge with the German Consul. After a brief conversation, the captain left to visit the Director of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Shanghai Office, Yu Ming. When Yu was out, Captain Xue left a name card and went out. He then went to the Navy Department in Gaochang Temple to visit our naval authorities. Finally, he visited Chairman Bell of the Public Works Bureau and returned to the ship at 11:00 a.m. Mayor Wu, accompanied by Secretary Tang Shixuan, drove to the Yangshupu riverside at 4:30 p.m. and boarded the ship's special welcoming boat to return the visit. The captain cordially received him and they talked for half an hour before leaving. It was also learned that Mayor Wu plans to host a banquet on the afternoon of the 9th of this month to entertain the captain, at which time he will invite German officers stationed in Shanghai to participate to strengthen the relationship.</p>
<h3>Reception and Tour</h3>
<p>The cruiser "Königsberg" yesterday at 2:50 PM, dispatched a small steamboat from the Customs Wharf on Yangshupu Lanhua Road to receive visitors to the ship. The German Consul-General had previously invited reporters from Chinese and Western newspapers in the city to the ship and sent Mr. Jiao Shanfu, the consulate secretary, to take care of everything at the wharf. At 2:50 PM, over twenty Chinese and Western guests arrived and boarded the small steamboat to the ship. The ship's captain, Lieutenant Colonel Schneidewind, personally came out to receive them. The German Consul, Mr. Barendes, also came to the ship to engage with the guests. First, the captain gave a detailed account of the ship's long voyage, saying, in brief, that he was delighted that the ship had come to Shanghai and met with the reporters, and had seen the three million Chinese people of Shanghai. He had originally intended to visit Nanjing from Shanghai, but due to the short time, he feared he would not be able to go. He hoped that the naval cadets and students would all gain some experience from this trip, and he hoped for guidance from all sectors, etc. After the speech, champagne was raised, and mutual good health was wished, and the ship's deputy captain, Mr. Stiger, was introduced. Several officers were also assigned to receive and answer questions from everyone. At 3:30 PM, the deputy commander led the group on a tour of all parts of the ship.</p>
<h3>Ship Equipment</h3>
<p>The Königsberg cruiser has a displacement of 6,000 tons, a length of 176 meters above the waterline, and 169 meters below the waterline, a width of 15 meters, and a draft of 5.5 meters. The construction is of the latest type, with a very small width, so that the target can be reduced when the enemy inspects it. The ship's engine has 65,000 horsepower, so it can travel 32 nautical miles per hour. The ship is equipped with 17 gun positions, including nine 15 cm caliber guns, three each at the bow, stern, and midship, and eight 8 cm caliber guns. The upper eight large guns can be moved for high-angle fire, and four powerful electric searchlights are placed in the middle of the upper deck, two facing forward and two facing aft. The entire ship is built with steel plates, and the bridge and other locations are very well connected. Sound tubes for issuing orders are installed everywhere, which is very thoughtful.</p>
<h3>Naval Officers and Men</h3>
<p>The Königsberg has a total of 580 officers and men, including 30 officers of various ranks, and 76 graduates of the German Naval Academy. This time, they were dispatched to the ship to practice sailing, so they also accompanied the ship here. Yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, the sailors were ordered to go ashore freely for sightseeing. Six public buses were hired by the German Consulate to transport the soldiers to various places on Nanjing Road for everyone to enjoy, shop, visit friends, etc. They were required to return to the ship at 7:00 PM that night.</p>
<h3>Stay in Shanghai Schedule</h3>
<p>The Königsberg cruiser's stay in Shanghai is scheduled for two weeks. Due to the urgency of time, they will not be able to visit our government authorities in Nanjing. Yesterday afternoon, in addition to receiving reporters, the German expatriates in Shanghai held a grand welcome party at the club in the evening and went to the ship to view it. Today, the German Consulate-General is hosting the officers and men of the ship, and Mayor Wu and others are also invited. Tomorrow, the German Consul-General will invite the ship's officers to a dinner at the consulate. On the 5th, the officers and men will visit the German school on Great Western Road. The 6th is a Sunday holiday. In the afternoon of the 7th, from 3:00 PM to 6:00 PM, it will be open to the public, and Chinese and Western people in Shanghai are welcome to visit.</p>
<h3>Ship History</h3>
<p>The cruiser Königsberg was originally a German large cruiser. At the beginning of the European War in 1914, it fought against the British fleet and was sunk. At that time, the German government urgently built a second cruiser, also named Königsberg. After its completion, it was incorporated into the fleet and fought against the Allied navy and sacrificed for the country again. The current Königsberg was built after the signing of the peace treaty, but it is actually the third Königsberg. There are now two new 10,000-ton ships completed in Germany, but they will not come to Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Departure Date from Shanghai</h3>
<p>The ship is scheduled to depart from Shanghai on the 14th of this month. From here, it will pass through Little Luzon, Singapore, the Mediterranean, and India to the German naval port of Wilhelmshaven. It is roughly estimated to arrive on December 12th. This long voyage will last exactly one year, and the return voyage will follow the original sea route when coming to Shanghai.</p>
<p>The Money Trade Association Cables the Ministry of Finance</p>
<h3>Increase the Amount of Silver Coin Minting</h3>
<p>Failure to Exchange Fully Leads to Financial Stagnation</p>
<p>Or Devise Other Good Ways to Remedy and Facilitate Circulation</p>
<p>To the Shanghai Money Trade Association: Yesterday, a telegram was sent to the Ministry of Finance in Nanjing: "To the esteemed Ministry of Finance in Nanjing, we humbly believe that since the proposal to abolish the tael and replace it with the yuan was raised, our association has mostly advocated for gradual implementation. This is because silver taels have traditionally been used more in various places, while silver coins are in the minority. If the tael is abolished suddenly, the silver tael will be useless, and the silver coin will be insufficient for circulation, which may cause stagnation in finance. However, since the Ministry resolutely abolished the tael, silver taels from various places have gathered in Shanghai, accumulating more and more. Although it has been explicitly stipulated that the silver taels should be exchanged for silver coins at the Central Bank of China and the Bank of Communications to facilitate circulation, the mint currently produces only 100,000 yuan of national currency per day, which is insufficient for full exchange, leading to financial stagnation and difficulty in turnover. If this continues, the social economy may be directly affected. Therefore, we specifically telegram the Ministry, urging the mint to increase the amount of minting or devise other good ways to remedy and facilitate circulation. We eagerly await instructions. The Shanghai Money Trade Association."</p>
<p>Yu Hongjun Talks About Local Autonomy</p>
<h3>Mayor Wu Has Drafted a New Plan</h3>
<p>Implement the Urban Area First to Become a Model Area</p>
<p>Regarding the implementation of local autonomy in this city, it has not been possible to realize it immediately due to various reasons. According to a statement issued by Yu Hongjun, Chairman of the Local Autonomy Preparatory Committee, after the central government issued a general order for local authorities to promote local autonomy, this city immediately began preparations. All preparatory work was based on central laws and regulations, but each locality has its own special circumstances, and the central laws and regulations are formulated with reference to the national situation. If there are places in this city that are not very applicable, although the work of preparing for local autonomy in this city has lasted for two years, it has not been possible to see any results. This city was originally planned to be divided into 40 districts, each with a district head, and several instructors. The cost is estimated to be around 250,000 yuan, which is difficult for this city to bear with its current financial resources. Moreover, the circumstances of each district in this city are very different. For example, the urban area is very developed in industry and commerce, while everything in the rural area remains stagnant. If local autonomy is implemented in the same way, it will inevitably lead to the disadvantage of taking care of one thing and neglecting the other. Therefore, Mayor Wu recently intends to re-plan the implementation plan of local autonomy, first implementing it in the urban area to become a model area, and then gradually promoting it to the entire city after it has been successful, and absolutely breaking the bad habit of official rule over autonomy. The candidates for district heads must have knowledge and experience in local autonomy and have legitimate occupations. In the past, some people ridiculed the autonomy of this city, saying that the Autonomy Preparatory Committee was a matchmaking agency, and the district offices would become restaurants. Mayor Wu is deeply disturbed by this, so he plans to develop a new plan to reduce the autonomous area, increase the autonomous funding for each district, and raise the powers of the district heads so that citizens of each district have a sincere understanding of local autonomy.</p>
<p>All are able to participate automatically in the cause undertaken by the local autonomy. The reason why this city starts with the urban area is because</p>
<h2>Page 12</h2>
<p>Citizens in the urban area are more advanced in knowledge and richer in financial resources. Various people's organizations have now been legally established one after another. If we further assign them to matters, the results will be easier to achieve. In the future, each rural area can successively promote based on the acquired experience, which can avoid various difficulties and eliminate various malpractices, etc.</p>
<p>Lawyers' Association Attacks</p>
<h3>City Public Security Bureau Violates the Law</h3>
<p>Failure to Send Wang Shuchiao to the Judicial Organ for Trial</p>
<p>Submit to the Ministry Ordering the Municipal Government to Order the Bureau to Handle According to Law</p>
<p>The Shanghai Lawyers Association submitted a document to the Ministry of Justice regarding the case of Lawyer Wang Shuchiao being detained by the City Public Security Bureau, stating, "Submitted regarding the City Public Security Bureau illegally detaining a lawyer, requesting the submission to the Executive Yuan ordering the Municipal Government to order the Bureau to send the case to the court for investigation and trial. We have received a letter from the Shanghai Legal Society stating that Lawyer Wang Shuchiao is a member of our society and also a member of your association. This time, the public concession police authorities arrested him based on the confession of the criminal Zhou Zhizhang, who stated that Wang was suspected of being involved in the assassination of Zhao Tieqiao. However, according to the results of the trial by the Shanghai First Special District Local Court on July 16, Zhou Zhizhang confessed in court that the confession was obtained by torture. The fact that Lawyer Wang was falsely accused is obvious, and there is no other evidence to prove that Lawyer Wang has committed any illegal acts. Criminal procedure adopts the principle of direct trial, with the discovery of evidence as a prerequisite. Since there is no active proof of criminal suspicion, he was strictly released on bail according to law. It is against the law for the Municipal Public Security Bureau to suddenly apply to the court for transfer, saying that according to the confessions of criminals Long Lin and Tang Ming, Lawyer Wang Shuchiao is also suspected of being involved in the assassination of Song, and requesting a questioning session within three days. However, according to reports, the results of the questioning only stated that Long and Tang knew Lawyer Wang, and immediately considered him to have a significant suspicion, which is a completely arbitrary judgment. There is also no evidence related to the assassination of Song. It has been nearly ten days, and we have not heard that the City Public Security Bureau has sent the case back to the court. Although the defense lawyer has protested, it has been ineffective. Article 8, paragraph 2 of the Provisional Constitution of the Republic of China stipulates that if a person is arrested or detained on suspicion of a crime, the organ executing the arrest or detention shall transfer the person to the judicial organ for interrogation within 24 hours at the latest. The actions of the City Public Security Bureau violate the decision of the receiving court and do not comply with the Provisional Constitution, indicating that it has other purposes. Lawyer Wang Shuchiao has been abiding by the law since he began practicing law and does not participate in external affairs, which is deeply recognized by his colleagues. This time, he was groundlessly accused and involved in a fabricated case. The detention not only greatly impairs Lawyer Wang's personal freedom and his duties but also makes all members feel uneasy. Your association leads the masses and upholds justice, with the aim of upholding the national laws and the legal interests of all members. You should provide legal assistance to Lawyer Wang and immediately protest to the judicial authorities, limiting the City Public Security Bureau to send Lawyer Wang back to the court for continued trial in order to maintain the rule of law. Not only will Lawyer Wang be grateful, but our association will also benefit greatly." Article 227 of the Criminal Procedure Law stipulates that the Director of the Public Security Bureau, who has the same power to investigate crimes as the Prosecutor, shall transfer the arrested criminal suspect to the competent Prosecutor for interrogation within three days, except in necessary circumstances. The legal authority of the Director of the Public Security Bureau for investigating crimes is only in a subsidiary position in law, and he shall not transfer the suspect after three days unless there is evidence that will be immediately destroyed, or the accomplice will immediately escape, or it is necessary to bring the suspect to conduct a search, or the suspect suddenly suffers from a serious illness, or traffic is obstructed, etc., as clearly defined in Interpretation No. 306 of the Judicial Yuan. After Lawyer Wang Shuchiao was transferred to the case and detained by the Shanghai City Public Security Bureau, regardless of whether he has criminal suspicion, the Bureau did not send Lawyer Wang Shuchiao back to the original court for another investigation within the deadline set by the Shanghai First Special District Local Court, nor did it have the necessary circumstances under the proviso of Article 227 of the Criminal Procedure Law. It failed to transfer Lawyer Wang Shuchiao to the prosecutor in the jurisdiction to perform investigative duties within the statutory period prescribed by the same article. It has illegally detained him for more than ten days, resulting in a loss of credibility with the Shanghai First Special District Court, which will lead foreigners to believe that the judiciary is in darkness. Internally, the spirit of the Provisional Constitution and the judicial system are trampled upon, causing the public to suffer great pain. The Executive and Supervisory Committee of the Association decided to submit a request to the Ministry, requesting the submission to the Executive Yuan for prompt order to the Shanghai Municipal Government to strictly order the Public Security Bureau to immediately transfer Lawyer Wang Shuchiao to the court for investigation and trial in accordance with the law for public convenience."</p>
<p>The Standing Committee of the Fourth District Cotton Textile Workers' Union</p>
<h3>Huang Zhaohui Kidnapped</h3>
<p>Shenxin No. 5 Factory Opposes Organizing a Union</p>
<p>The Union Calls for a Petition Today</p>
<p>Xin Sheng News Agency reports that the dismissal of workers by the Shenxin Textile Factory No. 5 in Gaolang Bridge has been resolved, but the Union's Standing Committee member was suddenly kidnapped and disappeared the night before. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Resolution of Dismissal Dispute</h3>
<p>Shenxin No. 5 Factory has more than 2,600 male and female workers, and there has never been a union. Now, Wang Zhending and others are organizing the Fourth District Cotton Textile Workers' Union, which is about to be established, but it is opposed by the factory. The factory has repeatedly dismissed workers such as Li Fuqing, Wang Laowu, and Zhang Asan. After reporting to the Party and government organs, the Social Affairs Bureau summoned both parties for questioning yesterday morning and conducted mediation. The dispute over workers Wang Laowu and Zhang Asan was resolved by the employer paying one month's dismissal pay.</p>
<h3>Union Standing Committee Member Kidnapped</h3>
<p>At 11:30 PM the night before, Huang Zhaohui, a Standing Committee member of the Fourth District Cotton Textile Workers' Union, and the cook Li A'er were passing by the gate of the Ruitie Factory on Yangshupu Road. Because it was late at night and there were few pedestrians, more than ten strong men suddenly appeared, three of whom were holding pistols. They kidnapped Huang Zhaohui, the Standing Committee member of the Union, into a white-plated car parked by the side of the road and drove away quickly. Later, the cook returned to the Union to report. After the Union investigated separately, there is still no trace of him.</p>
<h3>Organizing a Petition Meeting</h3>
<p>After the incident, the Union convened a joint meeting of the Executive and Supervisory Committees. As a result of the discussion, it was decided to organize a petition meeting, setting up three groups: propaganda, general affairs, and investigation, to handle the negotiations. It was also decided to petition the Municipal Government, Social Affairs Bureau, Municipal Party Committee, and the General Labor Union this morning. According to the person in charge of the Fourth District Cotton Textile Workers' Union, who spoke to the Xin Sheng News Agency reporter, since Mr. Huang has no assets and is not enough to attract the attention of villains, and he has never done anything wrong to others, the only possibility for his kidnapping is that he has displeased someone by organizing a union and uniting workers.</p>
<h3>Flourishing Remittance Business of Jincheng Bank</h3>
<p>Jincheng Bank in this city, one of the four joint banks of Chinese merchants, has an outstanding reputation and prosperous business, and is deeply trusted by all sectors. Recently, the bank's domestic remittance business has been particularly developed. For any amount of money entrusted to the bank for remittance to major trading ports such as Peiping, Tianjin, and Qingdao, the remittance fee is waived, the procedures are simple, and the remittance is fast. General customers consider it convenient, which is in line with the bank's mission of serving society.</p>
<p>Dispute at Shuang Gong Silk Factory</p>
<h3>Resolved Yesterday Through Mediation</h3>
<p>All Wages Increased by Three Cents Starting in August</p>
<p>All Workers Scheduled to Resume Work on the Morning of the 5th</p>
<p>The dispute at the Fulun Heng Shuang Gong Silk Factory on Tianbao Road in this city, caused by the failure to restore the old treatment, was later mediated by the Social Affairs Bureau after several negotiations between the two parties due to differing opinions. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Origin of the Dispute</h3>
<p>Since the dispute at the Dan Gong Silk Factory was decided by the Party and government to restore wages from 45 cents to 50 cents, and to increase two days of work per month, the female workers at the factory requested the factory to follow the Dan Gong Factory's method, uniformly increasing wages by five cents, and increasing two days of work. The factory considered that the situations of the Dan Gong and Shuang Gong factories were different and it was impossible to accept. Therefore, all the female workers automatically went on strike on July 12. The Fourth District Silk Reeling Industry Union negotiated several times, but there were no results.</p>
<h3>Reporting to the Party and Government</h3>
<p>Since the negotiations between the two parties were ineffective after the strike, each reported the details of the situation and the reasons they held to the Party and government, requesting prompt mediation to avoid the prolongation of the dispute and cause losses to both labor and management. At the same time, the workers at the Honglun Shuang Gong Silk Factory on Liuying Road also continued to request the same and submitted a request for mediation.</p>
<h3>Mediation Result</h3>
<p>After receiving the report, the Social Affairs Bureau was deeply concerned that the trend would expand. It immediately summoned representatives of labor, Chen Xiu Pu and Le Xiao Rong, and representatives of capital, Shen Zu Pei and Zhu Wei Xuan, on the second day of yesterday, July. Zhu Gui Lin, Chief of the Third Section of the Social Affairs Bureau, presided. First, the Chairman advised both parties to understand each other and make concessions within the possible scope, so that the dispute could be resolved as soon as possible. After both parties explained their reasons, three settlement methods were decided as follows: 1) The female workers of the Fulun Heng Shuang Gong Silk Factory will uniformly restore an increase of three cents to their existing wages, which will be implemented starting in August. 2) Three months later, if the silk market declines, it may be temporarily reduced by one cent. If it is the same as the current situation, it may continue. 3) All female workers will be allowed to enter the factory and resume work on the morning of the 5th of this month. Both parties expressed agreement, and the settlement was reached.</p>
<h3>Honglun Dispute</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Honglun Factory did not send a representative to attend. The Chairman personally ordered the person in charge of the Sixth District Silk Reeling Industry Union to follow the Fulun method and negotiate a settlement with the factory first. If the settlement fails, the Social Affairs Bureau will convene a mediation, etc.</p>
<p>Sender Pays News Telegrams Between China and the United States</p>
<h3>Still Acceptable</h3>
<p>The paid telegrams from China and the United States to the recipients were originally scheduled to be discontinued for all political and news telegrams from August 1. The news should be sent by the sender paying the fee. According to the news from the International Telegraph Office in this city, news telegrams have been restored from August 2, and the method of the recipient paying the fee can still be handled. It is reported that the Bureau has posted notices to inform the public, and has notified all telegraph offices and radio stations.</p>

<p>Municipal Chamber of Commerce</p>
<h3>Regarding the Re-Struggle for the Mortgage Rights of the Arsenal Land</h3>
<p>Chairman Wang Yansong to Personally Meet Chairman Chiang</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, for the case of re-fighting for the Shanghai Arsenal land as mortgage for debt, has appointed Standing Committee Member Wang Yansong to go to Kuling to personally meet Chairman Chiang for a petition. He is also carrying a petition document, as follows: Presented as a petition matter: Upon investigation, after the end of the Jiangsu-Zhejiang War in the 13th year of the Republic of China, the authorities of the Ministry and the Province entrusted the former Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce to borrow commercial funds from banks and money shops on behalf of the government, for the purpose of paying for the demobilization of defeated soldiers and for providing supplies and transportation. The former Ministries of Finance and Army of Beijing jointly signed and stipulated that the arsenal base would be used as collateral, with formal official documents and receipt stamps issued. It was stipulated that when the factory relocation was implemented and the factory land was sold, all proceeds from the land price would be used to repay the advanced funds first. At that time, the factory had already stopped manufacturing machinery, and the former General Chamber of Commerce was entrusted with its safekeeping by order of the executive authority. All safekeeping expenses were also included in the aforementioned advanced funds. Subsequently, the factory relocation was not implemented, and the aforementioned mortgaged base was unsold indefinitely, leaving the principal and interest suspended. The former General Chamber of Commerce itemized the details into a detailed list and, in September of the 17th year, requested the Ministry of Finance and the Military Affairs Commission to arrange for repayment. Subsequently, the Ministry of Finance issued a directive ordering that the receipts for various loans and allocations listed in the list be copied and submitted one by one for verification, and also ordering that the two loans listed in the list, namely the 30% of the arsenal land price that Jiangsu Province should receive and the Welfare Company land price as collateral, be included in the scope of provincial funds and repaid by Jiangsu Province. The loss of foreign exchange was to be deducted immediately. The former General Chamber of Commerce, on February 21st of the 18th year of the Republic of China, complied and submitted the printed receipts and bills for various loans for verification, and also complied with deducting foreign exchange losses and separately requesting repayment from the provincial government for the two debts included in the scope of provincial funds. Since the scope has been divided, the principal and interest of those listed in the bill and falling within the central scope totaled 888,012 yuan, 3 jiao, 2 fen, and 3 li up to November 30th of the 17th year. On March 4th of the same year, the Ministry of Finance issued Directive No. 7842, stating that these advanced loans for military rehabilitation were related to local security at the time and should be transferred for handling after the establishment of the Internal and External Debt Consolidation Committee. In May of the same year, the three chambers of commerce were merged and reorganized, and the Merchants' Reorganization Committee acted on behalf of its functions. Upon hearing that the Internal and External Debt Consolidation Committee had been established, the case of the former Shanghai South Chamber of Commerce advancing funds on behalf of the government for military and police expenses was also copied and submitted, requesting the Ministry of Finance to handle it in conjunction with other cases. On September 26th of the same year, the Ministry of Finance issued Directive No. 9265, stating that the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Finance had previously submitted a case for the former Shanghai South Chamber of Commerce's advance payment for military and police expenses, and had already instructed the province to handle it independently. It was requested that direct contact be made with the department, etc. A long time has passed, and the various commercial firms that borrowed the funds at that time have repeatedly inquired. At that time, the affiliated association had also been organized and established, succeeding the Commercial Reorganization Committee in inheriting the debt claims and liabilities of the former Chamber of Commerce. On November 23rd of the 19th year, it also requested the Ministry of Finance to send the aforementioned loan case files and bills to the Internal and External Debt Consolidation Committee for review and consolidation as soon as possible. Subsequently, on December 18th of the same year, the Ministry of Finance issued Directive No. 11571, stating that the funds had been approved to be included in the consolidation plan, and that a detailed list had been compiled and would be transferred to the Internal and External Debt Consolidation Committee for handling in the near future. It is estimated that the total principal and interest of the various advanced loans approved to be included in the consolidation scope has reached 1,112,877 yuan, 9 jiao, 5 fen, and 7 li as of December of the 19th year. However, the two debts under the name of the former General Chamber of Commerce that were included in the scope of Jiangsu Province's independent management, as well as the former Shanghai South Chamber of Commerce's advance payment for military and police expenses, are still firmly denied by the provincial government. There are inquiries to the Ministry for instructions, and in January of the 20th year, the affiliated association submitted a request to the Ministry of Finance to determine responsibility and avoid mutual evasion, but no approval has been received to date, and it remains an outstanding case. This is a rough overview of the situation encountered in the past.) [Slight Omission] (Since the "January 28th" Incident, the relocation of the Shanghai Arsenal has been repeatedly reported, and the lawyer Zhang Tuzhao, commissioned by the factory, formally informed the affiliated association that, in order to protect creditor's rights, it submitted two inquiries to the Ministries of Finance and Military Affairs on March 15th and May 18th, requesting that the contract be fulfilled and that funds be allocated first to repay the advance payment after the factory property was sold. On June 16th, the Ministry of Military Affairs issued Directive No. 1569, stating briefly that the Shanghai Arsenal is a central property under the jurisdiction of the Ministry, and no local civil or military officials are allowed to dispose of it or allocate it as security for loans, which is an illegal measure and cannot be easily recognized, etc. The affiliated association then submitted a report to the Executive Yuan, stating that the factory property was used as security for advance payments with the approval of the Ministries of Finance and Army at the time, and the Ministry of Army also had a guarantee letter as evidence. The so-called illegal measure is a misdirected statement when applied to the Ministry of Army. National loans are also acts under private law, and once a contract is established, it is equally bound by civil law and cannot be easily denied by administrative order. After receiving this document, the Ministry of Military Affairs sent a letter to the chairman of the affiliated association, stating briefly that creditor's rights and interests should be maintained, but what should be deliberated is whether central property should be used as collateral for private feuds of warlords. The matter concerns the authority of the two ministries and has been submitted to the Executive Council for resolution, etc. During the era of warlords in power, were the bonds and treasury bills they issued not used for military purposes? Was the use of customs duties as a domestic debt fund not a mortgage on central property? After the national government established its capital in Nanjing, it continued to fulfill the various debts guaranteed by customs duties of the Beijing government. Why is there sudden doubt about the debts secured by factory property? Moreover, since it is said that creditor's rights and interests must be maintained, then the need for future debt repayment, no matter what kind of funds, will inevitably come from central property. All of this is difficult to understand. Both belong to legal acts, and only the court of jurisdiction has the right to judge whether the mortgage contract is valid or not. The state is also one of the parties to the contract, and to resolve the existence or termination of the contract by the Executive Council is no different from the debtor unilaterally declaring the mortgage contract invalid. For the sake of protecting the rule of law, for the sake of protecting creditor's rights, and for the sake of protecting the responsibility of the intermediary lender, the affiliated association has no choice but to openly and frankly state the facts to the authorities. In addition to publicly electing Standing Committee Member Wang Yansong and Standing Committee Member Lu Wenshao at the 43rd Standing Committee meeting on July 14th, and drafting a presentation to the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Military Affairs, and the Executive Council, earnestly stating the case so that the legally established mortgage contract would not be shaken, the creditors are now very eager to be repaid because the arsenal base is about to be disposed of. Therefore, Standing Committee Member Wang Yansong is re-elected to reiterate the previous situation and personally present a written request for your examination and approval, and to humbly request that you issue a directive to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry to continue to fulfill the original contract, maintain creditor's rights, and strengthen national credibility, which would be in the public interest.</p>
<p>Jiangsu-Zhejiang Fisheries Joint Office</p>
<h3>Yesterday's Telegram Requesting the Abolition of Fisheries Construction Fees</h3>
<p>The Joint Office of the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Fisheries Trade Association believes that President Wang and Chairman Chiang are using US cotton loans exclusively to assist farmers and must not be used for other purposes. Their concern for the people's livelihood is particularly profound. However, the Jiangsu-Zhejiang fisheries industry has been involved in disputes over the collection of construction fees. Repeated mediation has failed to resolve the issue, leading to Jiangsu-Zhejiang fishermen and fish merchants suffering daily from the harassment and extortion of the collection office personnel, and living in poverty and hardship with no one to turn to. Following the bankruptcy of the agricultural villages, the fisheries industry is now facing bankruptcy. The production industry is already in a state of economic depression. Therefore, a meeting of initiators was convened the day before yesterday, and it was resolved to send a telegram to President Wang and Chairman Chiang, detailing the past and present state, and immediately abolish the fisheries construction fees to alleviate the suffering of the people of Jiangsu. The office corrected and sent the telegram yesterday. The text of the telegram is as follows: Nanjing Executive Yuan President Wang, Nanchang Headquarters Executive Office Chairman Chiang, for your consideration: The Jiangsu-Zhejiang Fisheries Improvement Committee's case of collecting fisheries construction fees has caused oppression and harassment since the establishment of the collection office several months ago. Fishermen and fish merchants in both provinces are unable to bear it and have been running around appealing and submitting telegrams to the central government requesting a stop, but have not been approved. Having read your telegram on frugality, you have formulated comprehensive plans for the national economy and the people's livelihood, using the cotton and wheat loans exclusively for the major plans of agricultural and industrial construction. Your state-building plan is admired by China and foreign countries alike, and all people with blood and energy are encouraged. Considering China's geography, apart from the highlands, the coastal rivers and waters are mostly inhabited by fishermen. Just in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, there are no less than millions of fishermen and fish merchants engaged in this occupation, especially in Ningbo, Wenzhou, and Taizhou in Zhejiang Province. These fishermen live on boats, risking their lives in turbulent waves to obtain their catch. The hardship of their lives is even greater than that of farmers and workers. Moreover, in recent times, foreign ships have been rampant on the seas, and sea bandits are rampant, leading to the bankruptcy of the fisheries industry. Saving lives is already difficult enough, and there is no surplus clothing, let alone the strength to plan for construction. Even as the association claims to take from the fisheries and use for the fisheries, it is appropriate to raise large sums of money for relief during this period of fisheries decline. How can we cut flesh to heal sores, weakening the original vitality? Moreover, the association is not organized by legitimate groups in various fishing areas and fish markets. It is only using this name to profit from it. This is why fishermen find it difficult to recognize the collection of construction fees. As for fish merchants, those who sell dried and salted seafood and shellfish in the interior are called fish merchants. This is a transaction between merchants and merchants and is not a direct transaction with fishermen. According to the principles of collection, it is clearly stipulated that it should be taken from the fisheries and used for the fisheries. It has nothing to do with fish merchants. The collection office knows that it is difficult to collect directly from fishermen, so it uses the term "collecting on behalf of" and adds it to the fish merchants, forcing the merchants to pay taxes first and then deduct the price from the fishermen. Even products from other provinces and imported goods, such as salted seafood, etc., that have already been taxed by customs are all included in the collection list. Think about whether merchants can deduct this fee from fishermen in other provinces and countries? This is even more unheard of in the world. Furthermore, Article 35 of the Fisheries Law stipulates that the taxation of fisheries products is limited to one time. However, the association has established seven collection branch offices in the two provinces, and each district has more than ten small branch offices, which are more thorough than the previous customs posts. The greed of the collection personnel is even greater than that of the customs inspectors. At present, evidence of violations has been found everywhere, piled up in bundles. It is called one percent tax value, but from the starting point of the place of origin to the end point of military goods, each layer is taxed repeatedly, not just five or ten percent. Such a method is adding additional taxes to the merchants' business tax. This illegal and harsh tax is why fish merchants cannot collect construction fees on behalf of the government. In short, collecting this fee from fishermen is unkind, and collecting it from fish merchants is unjust. We have always admired your plans for the people's livelihood, your benevolence and righteousness, and your heart for the relief of farmers and workers. The book says, "If one man is not at peace, the responsibility lies with me." Millions of fishermen and fish merchants are all citizens, and their economic bankruptcy is greater than that of farmers and workers. You must be able to treat them equally and bestow grace upon them. We humbly request that you withdraw a few percent of the cotton and wheat loans for fisheries construction fees, and instruct the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to earnestly prepare construction projects, and immediately order the abolition of the current collection office, in line with the National Government's order of March 28th of the 20th year to exempt all fish taxes and fisheries taxes. Hereafter, no matter what organization is allowed to collect this tax under a different name. Collecting this construction fee not only violates the central government's laws and regulations, but even if it is allowed to collect illegally, the annual income is only several hundred thousand, and such a collection method will inevitably lead to the death of fishermen and the closure of merchants. For a few individuals, it is indeed beneficial, but it is harmful to the national foundation. If collected according to the law, the statistical income of the two provinces is only two to three hundred thousand per year. After deducting expenses, even if it is all turned over to the government, it is only a small amount. What construction can be talked about? Therefore, whether it is for public or private reasons, there is no need to collect it. Therefore, we have poured out our heartfelt feelings and humbly request your consideration and implementation. Jiangsu and Zhejiang would be fortunate.

<h3>Feng Yuxiang's Telegram Explaining His Aims</h3>
<p>Feng Yuxiang sent a telegram to the world today, stating his position on President Wang's and Chairman Chiang's telegram on frugality, saying that since the start of the expedition on the day of last month, all the generals and soldiers have been extraordinary and selfless, and within ten days, they have captured Kangbao and Guyuan, and fought a bloody battle in Duolun for five days and nights. Not only has the territory been recovered and justice been shown, but also their declaration that "guns will never be pointed inward" has become an ironclad proof in reality. He did not expect that, despite the existence of facts, there are those who will understand the country. Respectfully announce the situation, hoping for enlightenment, etc.</p>

<h3>Yu Huiguan's Family Background Was Ordinary</h3>
<p>Yu Huiguan, Chairman of the Foci Pharmaceutical Factory, was attacked by thugs at 11:30 PM on the 1st at the intersection of Wangzhi Road and Beile Road in the French Concession, and was fatally wounded and died on the spot. The details were reported in yesterday's newspaper. According to reports, Yu Huiguan was originally from Kunming, Yunnan. His ancestors once served in Korea, so he was registered as Korean. When Korea was annexed by Japan, he was indignant and returned to China, recovering his Republic of China nationality and obtaining Nationality Recovery Certificate No. 3 from the Ministry of Interior. Later, he came to Shanghai to engage in commerce, serving as a compradore at the American Ewo Yang Line at 35 Renji Road. In the autumn of the 19th year, he and Zheng Pingshu, Chen Yuzhang, Yang Wenyong, Feng Mingzheng, and others organized the Foci Pharmaceutical Factory Co., Ltd. to improve Chinese medicine, registered with the Ministry of Industry and Commerce of the National Government, and obtained Registration License No. 29. Yu was elected chairman of the board of directors, and the factory's progress was rapid due to his detailed planning. Yu was also quite active in revolutionary work and social undertakings, serving as a standing committee member of the 21st Branch of the Second District of the Kuomintang Shanghai Municipal Party, an executive committee member of the Shanghai Second Special District Citizens' Union, a director of the Zhabei Defense Corps, and a standing committee member of the National Goods Promotion Association. Yu lived at 164 Tongji Road and Qingyun Road intersection in Zhabei. He was 42 years old. His brother, Yu Huibin, is an investigator in the Political Department of the French Concession police, known as "Old Gao Long". He is originally from Kunming, Yunnan. His father did business in Korea. The deceased grew up in Korea and obtained Japanese nationality. He married a Korean woman and had children. Later, he came to Shanghai to do business and recovered his Chinese nationality, becoming a member of the Yunnan Association. In the 16th year of the Republic of China, he married Feng Peilan from Hangzhou in Shanghai, and had three children.</p>
<h3>The Body Was Transported to Fumin Hospital</h3>
<p>After being murdered the night before last, the French Concession police, based on the report of his brother and son Yu Rentai, stated that the deceased was Korean and, according to regulations, notified the Japanese Consulate to send personnel to examine the body. However, the deceased's wife, Feng Peilan, opposed the examination by the Japanese Consulate because the deceased had recovered his Chinese nationality. At the same time, the Second Special District Citizens' Union (where the deceased was an executive committee member) reported to the Municipal Government and the Municipal Party Department, proposing negotiations. The Political Department of the French Concession police had approved the request of the deceased's brother and son to allow the Japanese Consulate to transport the body away. The body had been moved from the autopsy room to the car, and just as it was about to leave, the Criminal Department of the French Concession police stopped the transportation and moved the body back to the autopsy room, following Chinese regulations, and reported to the Second Special District Local Court Prosecutor's Office at noon, requesting that Prosecutor Wang Ren and a forensic scribe come to the scene to examine the body and ascend the court. According to the request of the deceased's wife, Feng Peilan, to claim the body for burial, the Local Court Prosecutor interviewed</p>
<h3>Chen Baosheng Appeals</h3>
<p>Premeditated Murder is Not the Same as Conspiracy to Murder</p>
<p>Determined That the Original Judgment's Sentencing Lacked Deliberation</p>
<p>Chen Baosheng, the assistant compradore of the Xin Renhe Steamer, was arrested and sentenced to ten years of imprisonment by the Local Court. However, Prosecutor Zhang Zi believed that Chen Baosheng was clearly identified by the defendants' testimonies as the initiator of the crime, and the original charge was premeditated murder under Article 284, but the judgment was changed to conspiracy to murder, and the sentencing lacked deliberation. Therefore, he filed an appeal based on his authority and notified the defendant of the reasons for his defense yesterday.</p>
<p>Hooligans Demand a Ransom</p>
<h3>Actually Trying to Force a Decent Woman into Prostitution</h3>
<p>Zhu Yihong Shamelessly Sells His Cousin</p>
<p>Liao Xiaoyi Violently Snatches Another Man's Wife</p>
<p>Wang Naifen, a woman from Changzhou, is 21 years old. Her father died early when she was young, and she was raised by her mother. Around the 17th year of the Republic of China, Naifen's cousin, Zhu Yihong, was a hooligan who saw that his cousin was in her prime and beautiful, and had bad intentions. He pretended to come to Shanghai for sightseeing and took Naifen to Shanghai, selling her as a prostitute in the private brothel opened by Liao Xiaoyi at 33 Baxianfang, Baxianqiao in the French Concession. All the money for her body, 500 foreign dollars, was taken by Zhu Yihong, who disappeared without a trace. When Naifen realized this, she was trapped in a fire pit, alone and helpless in a foreign land, with no one to turn to. She had to endure the humiliation and engage in this life of a goddess, forced by the madam to go to the Great World and other entertainment venues every night to secretly prostitute herself. However, Liao Xiaoyi and others were also violent and ruthless. Usually, if she slightly displeased them or did not receive guests at night, she would be whipped and subjected to various abuses, which were unbearable. Fortunately, she had a good fortune. In November of last year, Naifen met a sincere customer named Liu Yaoming, who is 28 years old and from Wuxi. He works as a manager in the Shengyuan Medicinal Materials Store in Dongjie, Dōngmén. He felt sorry for Naifen's plight and negotiated with the madam and others, willing to pay 400 foreign dollars to redeem her. The madam and others took it as a rare opportunity to make a huge profit and demanded 800 dollars from Liu to redeem her. Although negotiations were held several times, they still insisted on 800 dollars. For the sake of love, Liu had to agree and paid 400 dollars to rescue Naifen from hell in March of this year, and they lived together at 3 Maoyifang, Xiyao Lane in the city. Later, he paid another 100 dollars, but was still short of 300 dollars, and agreed to pay the rest later. However, Liao Xiaoyi and others still refused to return the bill of sale to Naifen and declared that they would only return the bill after the remaining amount was paid in full. Liu Yaoming did not care about Liao and others because they were all hooligans. Unexpectedly, both attempted suicide by hanging but coincidentally survived.</p>
<h3>The Great Harm of Flower Gambling</h3>
<p>Flower gambling is more harmful than floods and fierce beasts, a fact long known to all. Now, there is Chen, the 29-year-old wife of Zhang Yitian, a villager from Fan Lane, Fan Huang Du, west of Shanghai. Recently, she became addicted to flower gambling, staking everything on a single throw, accumulating significant debts. Fearing her husband's discovery, she secretly borrowed from relatives. Day by day, the debt piled up, and her clothing and jewelry were almost entirely pawned. Now, unable to repay, she conceived the idea of ending her life. The day before yesterday afternoon, she seized an opportunity to hang herself with her belt, attempting suicide. Fortunately, she was glimpsed by someone entering, who rushed forward to save her, allowing her to be reborn. As the neighbors spread the news and rushed to witness the scene, a neighbor named Jin, hearing of Chen's suicide attempt, hurried home to tell his wife, Wang, to go and see. By coincidence, as the saying goes, misfortune never comes singly, his wife, also deeply in debt from flower gambling, was also contemplating suicide. She had dressed herself in new clothes and was about to place the hemp rope around her neck when her husband rushed in. Seeing her condition, he was shocked and furious, and slapped her cheeks, snatching the rope away. A commotion ensued, with everyone exclaiming about the double suicide attempt, marveling incessantly, and attracting an endless stream of onlookers.</p>
<p>[L 128,000 Yuan Robbery Case]</p>
<h3>Continued Capture of Big Luo Song's Concubine</h3>
<p>Stolen silver dollars amounting to two thousand found under the tiles</p>
<p>A total of seven male and female suspects captured and brought to justice for interrogation</p>
<p>On the morning of June 16th, a major robbery of 128,000 yuan occurred on Yong'an Street in the French Concession. The Huazi (Chinese) Concession police apprehended three robbers in the Public Concession of this city, as well as in Jiaxing and Pudong, recovering some of the stolen silver dollars. Details were reported in this newspaper multiple times. After one of the fleeing accomplices, Jiang Gaiyuan (nicknamed Big Luo Song), a native of Shandong, was arrested in Tianjin, his concubine, Jiang Qin (also known as Jiang Damei), aged 23, carrying some of the stolen money, sought refuge at the home of her biological father, Qin Songhua, aged 46, at No. 18 Zhangjiazhai in Pudong. However, their plans were discovered by Dong Zhaojian, the director of the Third Section of the Third District of the Pudong Municipal Public Security Bureau, who reported the information to Bureau Chief Wen Hongen. The night before last, Wen ordered Inspectors Shang Heming and Xu Yaoting, along with plainclothes detectives from the First Squad of the Police Corps, to collaborate with armed police officers Cai Xueqin and Li Changfa from the Third Section. Around 9 p.m. the night before last, they went to the address and apprehended Jiang's parents-in-law, Qin Songhua and Qin Zhang (aged 45), Jiang's concubine Jiang Qin (i.e., Damei), and her younger sister, Qin Cuizhen (aged 16), in a melon field near Zhangjiazhai. They also found 2,000 silver dollars, all banknotes, hidden under tiles behind the bed in the house. During interrogation, Jiang Qin confessed that the silver dollars were sent to the Qin family for safekeeping by Jiang's younger brother-in-law, who lived at No. 6 Zhonghe Lane, Pingliang Road, Yangshupu, Hongkou. The officers then took the four suspects and the 2,000 silver dollars to the bureau. After Bureau Chief Wen interrogated them, he ordered the head of the Detective Team, Lu Ying, to dispatch detective leader Chen Guangyan, along with detectives Li Maoxuan and Zhang Kun, escorting the female suspect Jiang Qin, to work with Chinese and foreign detectives from the Huishan Police Station. At 3:30 a.m. yesterday, they secretly went to No. 6 Zhonghe Lane, No. 9 Taihe Lane, and No. 12 Rende Lane, Pingliang Road, Yangshupu, and successively apprehended the Qinggang members Ma Yongchang and Ma Yongdong, brothers, and Ma Fan. They were taken to the police station, where they were separated and detained. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Zhang Tianyin, the police station's lawyer, detailed the previous events. After the judge clarified the case, the location of the incident being in the French Concession, French Concession Police Chief Jin Jiulin arrived and requested that the suspects be transferred to their jurisdiction for legal proceedings. It is said that the Municipal Public Security Bureau has agreed to transfer the arrested suspects for legal proceedings.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Liao Xiaoyi suddenly learned that Liu Yaoming had gone to Hangzhou to handle goods. He instigated thugs Li Caifa, Wang Heshang, and Ding Baosheng to go to Mao Yi Lane, find Naifen, and force her to return to the Liao family and resume her prostitution until Liu had paid off the 300 yuan he owed. Naifen firmly refused, leading to a conflict. Wang Dongfu, the guard at the sixth post there, heard the commotion and arrived, arresting Li Caifa and the other two. He took them to the Third Section of the First Battalion. After preliminary interrogation by Section Chief Jin, considering that the case involved forcing a woman into prostitution, he ordered a formal document to be prepared and sent to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for investigation.</p>
<p>Inheritance of Over 300,000</p>
<h3>Entirely Managed by the Eldest Brother</h3>
<p>Wu Huigen sues his cousin Huiju</p>
<p>Requests the delivery and accounting of the inheritance</p>
<p>Wu Huiju, a wealthy businessman from Dinghai, is 58 years old. He currently resides in Dongchang'an Lane, Wusong Road, and owns assets worth hundreds of thousands. His biological son, Deshan, died at the age of seven or eight, leaving him without an heir. He then spent money to buy two children from Jiangbei and Shandong as adopted sons, naming them Defeng and Deniao. They are now thirteen or fourteen years old and attend school. Recently, his cousin, Wu Huigen, hired lawyer Zhang Shewo to file a lawsuit in the First Special District Local Court, accusing him of embezzling inheritance documents and requesting a judgment ordering him to deliver and account for the inheritance. Wu Huiju and Wu Huigen's grandfather, Wu Laoyi, had three sons: the eldest, Baoshan, who was Huiju's father; the second, Shuangbao, who was Huigen's father; and the youngest, Amu, who never married. Laoyi started his career in the sand business and left an inheritance of over 100,000 upon his death. Because the brothers Baoshan and Shuangbao had a deep bond, they did not divide the inheritance. All the assets were managed by Baoshan, who oversaw their operation and growth without interference. Shuangbao, meanwhile, worked as the chief foreman of the Taikoo Wharf, earning a substantial monthly income, which he also gave to his elder brother. By the time Shuangbao passed away, the Wu family's wealth had increased to over 300,000. However, at that time, Huigen was still in his infancy, while Huiju was already in his thirties. Therefore, after Baoshan's death, Huiju took over his father's position and managed the family fortune, handling all income and expenses. Over the years, Huigen grew up and resented his cousin for not providing him with education in his youth or arranging his marriage in his adulthood, and for seizing the inheritance, intending to swallow it whole. He filed a lawsuit in court, and the court has scheduled a hearing for this morning.</p>
<h3>Record of Interrogation of Female Bandit Leader Wang Bamei</h3>
<p>The two major robbery cases in Ganpu and Dianshan Lake</p>
<p>Wang Bamei firmly denies participating in either</p>
<p>Chen Zhou claims to have rowed to Minhang to gather information</p>
<p>On the night of the ninth day of the second lunar month of last year, eight wealthy families, including Yang Bangfan (Zijian Shi), a former director of the Shanghai Arsenal and chief of staff to Sun Chuanfang, and Sun Zhenqiu (the wealthy owner of the Si Quan Xiang Ju with assets of 300,000), hired boats to transport their families and belongings to Shanghai to escape the Sino-Japanese war, which was raging fiercely and causing panic in the rear. On the way, they were robbed by bandits in Dianshan Lake. Wang Yushan, the deputy director of the transportation department of the 19th Route Army, was on one of the boats and was shot dead on the spot by the bandits for resisting with a gun. After the female bandit leader Wang Bamei was captured in Shanghai, she was transferred to the Bandit Suppression Command in Jiangsu one evening and interrogated yesterday (the 2nd). The following is a record of her photo and confession: Wang Bamei confessed that she was 28 years old and from Pinghu, Zhejiang province. She had been living with Shi Lianyuan for about three years and was engaged in smuggling salt. Shi Lianyuan and Kongtou A-liu (i.e., Wang Youru) were in the same gang. When Ganpu town in Haiyan County, Zhejiang, was robbed, I was in Songjiang and did not go. Shi Lianyuan went. After the Ganpu robbery, because of the tense situation outside, I broke up with him and lived in Xinqiaotou, Songjiang, where I became acquainted with a battalion commander surnamed He. I saw two people from Shanghai called Jiangbei Xiaomanzi (i.e., Chen Yousheng, who is in custody at the Bandit Suppression Command) and Shen Jinsheng (i.e., Shen Hebao, who has been executed by the Bandit Suppression Command). They were heading south. Many people went to that robbery, such as Gao Guiyou Fang Mazi (i.e., Fang Ruihe), Wang A-liu, Shen Jinsheng, Shi Lianyuan, etc. Although I didn't go to this robbery, I had two rifles that Lianyuan took and used. I also had two Mauser pistols, but Gao Guiyou knew where they were hidden and took them. These guns were all used when smuggling salt. As for the confession of the bandit Lu Xingyuan, who was captured in Fengxian County, that I robbed and kidnapped in Ganpu town, I really didn't go. Gao Guiyou and others said that I went with them, but please investigate. As for the robbery of the Wuxi-Shanghai boat in Dianshan Lake and the shooting of the transportation director of the 19th Route Army, I was sick at the time. Qi A-xiong, Qi A-you, etc., who have also been captured by the Bandit Suppression Command, said that I went with them to rob the steamboat in Yuhuitang, but I really don't know Qi A-xiong and the others, and I didn't rob it either.</p>
<p>The two rifles that Shi Lianyuan took have reportedly been taken by others. Chen Zhou confessed that she was 41 years old and from Jiangbei. Her husband's name is Chen Yousheng, i.e., Jiangbei Xiaomanzi. They lived by smuggling salt and selling ginger. As for Gao Guiyou and others robbing Dayun Temple in Pinghu and Mocheng town in Changshu, I don't know about that. Because Chen Yousheng and Chen A-si were arrested in the first district of Minhang, I rowed to Minhang to gather information and was arrested. All of them are extremely cunning. The bandit Xue Xiaomingzi, who was in custody, was also interrogated. According to his confession, Wang Bamei ordered the assembly at Jinshan Bay for the robbery of Ganpu town. More than 90 people went in total, and they robbed five or six hundred silver dollars, which were used for food. They kidnapped more than 30 hostages, and the remaining 18 were released. The rest were rescued by Battalion Commander Fan's troops in Taihu Lake. They were all sent to prison together.</p>

<p>Gu Family Town</p>
<h3>Major Conflict Between Police and Civilians</h3>
<p>Banning the performance of puppet shows</p>
<p>Gunshots at midnight</p>
<p>A stray bullet kills a watermelon vendor</p>
<p>The branch office is destroyed</p>
<p>Gu Family Town (originally named Gujiazhai) in Baoshan County, about two miles northeast of Donglu Village, experienced a major conflict between police and civilians the night before last. The reason was that the villagers there wanted to put on a puppet show. First, the village chief, Hu Guoquan, submitted a request to the Third Branch of the Second Branch of the Baoshan County Public Security Bureau, asking Inspector Zhang Ming'an to report to Bureau Chief Gao Xichang, who then submitted it to the county government. The request was rejected on the grounds that mixed-gender performances were detrimental to public morals. Unexpectedly, the villagers insisted on performing the show. The responsible Public Security Bureau, together with the Baoan Tuan (Security Corps), went to dissuade them. However, the villagers did not listen, so the police took several puppets with the intention of taking them back to the office to report to the bureau chief for instructions. On the way, they were chased by hundreds of villagers who demanded their return. The police and security corps had no choice but to return all the puppets and urge them to stop. Unexpectedly, the villagers included complex elements, with a few troublemakers shouting and hitting. The villagers chased after them again, surrounding the police. A portion of the unruly elements armed themselves with iron bars, wooden sticks, benches, and other weapons. The number of people was large, and their momentum was strong, making it impossible for the police and security corps to stop them. They fired several shots into the air in an attempt to scare the crowd and escape the encirclement. Although many of the villagers were frightened and retreated, some, knowing that the shots were blanks, became bolder and swarmed forward with their weapons. The police fired several more shots, and a watermelon vendor who was trying to make a small profit was hit in the stomach by a stray bullet, bleeding and falling to the ground. At this point, the crowd retreated, and the police and security corps scattered and fled. Shortly after, more than a hundred people rushed to the Second Branch of the Gu Family Town and began beating people indiscriminately. Police Chief Ni Baoyuan was tied up and taken away, subjected to violent assault. A pistol that the police chief had on his person, as well as Russian-style rifles in the station, were lost. The contents of the branch office were completely destroyed. Yesterday, after the reporter learned of the incident, he immediately rushed to investigate and saw that the injured police chief had been taken back to Baoshan to examine his injuries, barely breathing, and in danger of losing his life. The deceased (i.e., the watermelon vendor) had already been examined by the county government, which sent Inspector He Cheng and a coroner to the scene. The deceased was identified as Zhang Yu, also known as Xiao Bao A-mao, 28 years old, with a bullet wound to the abdomen above the navel. The bullet did not exit the body. The deceased's family includes a grandmother in her seventies, younger siblings, and a wife who had been recently married and had an eight-month-old daughter. The family consisted of ten people in total, who usually relied on the deceased for their livelihood. At the time, the gunshots were like an enemy invasion. The deceased, Zhang Yu, was killed by a stray bullet, and it is unknown which gun fired the fatal shot. The matter still needs to be investigated. Police Chief Ni Baoyuan was tied up with wire and released after being beaten. Several other police officers sustained minor injuries and were not sent to the county. It is also known that Gu Family Town is about six li away from Liuhang. The Second Branch of the Public Security Bureau is located in Liuhang, and Gu Family Town has only one branch office. Bureau Chief Gao Xichang believes that the area cannot be without protection for even a day, so he went to the branch office yesterday to reorganize it.</p>
<p>Report from the Temporary Cholera Prevention Office</p>
<h3>Number Two</h3>
<p>Shanghai Temporary Cholera Prevention Office Announcement No. 2, August 2nd, 1933: (1) Although cholera has not yet been discovered in Shanghai this year, it sometimes appears as late as August. For example, in 1931 (the 20th year of the Republic), the first case was discovered on August 8th. However, even if it does become prevalent, it will be mild and will certainly not be as rampant and widespread throughout the country as last summer. This is what we dare to assert. (2) The first confirmed case of cholera this year was discovered in Wuchang on July 24th. The patient was a Chinese man, 50 years old, admitted to the Wuhan Provincial Hospital. He had obvious symptoms of cholera, and his stool was bacteriologically tested and confirmed to be cholera. (3) In addition to this confirmed case of cholera, there are also unconfirmed cases with clinical symptoms of cholera. They are listed below: Shanghai, cholera-like diarrhea, 15 cases; gastrointestinal problems, 317 cases; Suzhou, 1 case (authenticity being investigated); Guangzhou, 1 case (authenticity being investigated); Hangzhou, 6 cases; Shantou, 2 cases; Tianjin, 1 case; Qinhuangdao, 1 case; Yantai, 2 cases; Hankou, 2 cases; Zhenjiang, 5 cases. (4) To standardize the bacteriological diagnostic criteria for cholera, the subcommittee of this office has formulated diagnostic guidelines, which have been distributed to health authorities in various outer ports. Anyone conducting bacteriological diagnosis of cholera should follow the procedures below to confirm it: (A) Cholera vibrio should be found in stool smears; (B) A reliable cholera serum should show an agglutination reaction (with physiological saline as a control); (C) The cholera red test should be performed. (5) Although there is no real epidemic in Shanghai, the number of vaccinations has increased sharply. The three municipal authorities have achieved very good results. The number of vaccinations as of the end of July is listed below:</p>
<p>July Total Up to June 30th Total</p>
<p>Shanghai City 152,885 226,811 379,696</p>
<p>Public Concession 63,594 122,777 186,371</p>
<p>French Concession 18,554 42,958 61,522</p>
<p>Total 235,033 392,546 627,579</p>
<p>Although cholera has not occurred this year, the general public is more enthusiastic about vaccination than last year. All citizens who have not been vaccinated are encouraged to be vaccinated to prevent the epidemic. (6) The public has many doubts about the quality of tap water, but the water quality of the three major water companies has been tested and found to be very clean. In June, 42 samples of water from the Shanghai Water Company were tested (32 samples from ordinary taps and 10 samples from public taps). According to reports from the Shanghai and French Concession municipal authorities, the tap water in each concession also meets the same clean standards. Tap water in the city is safe to drink, but those who are suspicious often boil or filter it before drinking. It has also been observed that hotels, restaurants, and ice cream parlors in the city consume large amounts of ice water and tap water without any special treatment, but no adverse effects have been seen. (7) This year is a year of bumper watermelon crops, and one yuan can buy ten watermelons. Other melons and fruits are also unusually abundant. If you wash them before buying or eating them, cut them fresh, there will be no accidents. Bacteria cannot penetrate the skin of the melon or enter it through the roots. (8) The weather in July was similar to last year. After June, it was exceptionally hot, but not as humid as the same month last year. The highest temperature was 99.5 degrees Fahrenheit on July 16th. The highest temperature last year was 101.5 degrees on July 14th. The average temperature this month was 83.7 degrees, and the humidity was 82.3 degrees. Last year, the average temperature was 82.6 degrees, and the humidity was 88.4 degrees. As for the reason why cholera has not been discovered this year, it certainly cannot be explained solely by the weather. There must be other reasons. (9) The water samples studied by the epidemiological research group of this office from Yangshupu, Hongkou, Suzhou Creek, Xujiahui, and the Huangpu River were found to contain vibrio (non-cholera vibrio). The number was low in April, high in May, and almost 100% in June and July. Of the 22 samples tested from wells and ponds in Zhabei, 20 contained vibrio. Also, five water samples from wells and rivers in Ningbo were found to contain vibrio. Therefore, it can be concluded that the water tested that is not tap water contains non-agglutinating aquatic vibrio. This bacteria is different from the agglutinating cholera vibrio found in the feces of cholera patients. According to a report from Mr. Cheng of the Shanghai Municipal Health Laboratory, of the 302 stool samples tested, four cholera strains were found that could be confirmed by sugar testing, but they had a hemolytic reaction. The Public Works Department's bacteriological laboratory found as many as 20 strains of non-agglutinating vibrio after studying many stool samples. (10) For publicity work, methods such as leaflets, slogans, news broadcasts, lectures, and movies are used. The general public in Shanghai is now aware of the dangers of these summer diseases and is willing to abide by the prevention methods promulgated by the health authorities. The Chinese and foreign press have been helpful in promoting the message.</p>
<p>Public Works Department Board of Directors</p>
<h3>Discussion of Factory Inspection Case Yesterday</h3>
<p>No results yet</p>
<p>Scheduled for further discussion</p>
<p>Negotiations on the inspection of factories in the concession, after several consultations between Municipal Secretary-General Yu Hongjun and Public Concession Public Works Department Director Feixin Dun, a solution has been drafted. Mr. Fei submitted this solution to the Public Works Department Board of Directors regular meeting at 4:30 pm yesterday. After some discussion, no results were achieved and it will be discussed further at the next regular meeting (September 6th).</p>
<p>In the Li Guojie Case</p>
<h3>Huang Jusu's Trial Suspended</h3>
<p>Li Guojie, general manager of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, was sentenced to three years in prison by the local court for borrowing foreign debts and engaging in malfeasance. Li appealed, and the High Court changed the sentence to three and a half years. He is now appealing to the Third Instance. Huang Jusu, a former Zhongshan County magistrate and member of the committee, and Wang Yunzhang, Li's foreign language secretary, are also implicated in the same case, either as accomplices or co-conspirators. Therefore, the prosecutor filed a public prosecution against them for dereliction of duty. However, the Criminal Court ruled to suspend the trial proceedings because the defendants were not present, and ordered a warrant for their arrest. The case will be concluded after they are apprehended.</p>
<h3>Three Hundred Japanese Marines Suffer from Dysentery</h3>
<p>The Osaka Asahi Shimbun reported on the 29th that since the start of the infectious disease season, 300 marines in Shanghai have contracted dysentery. Among them, three non-commissioned officers under the jurisdiction of the Wu Naval Base died on the 27th of last month. The marines are now working hard to prevent the spread of the disease.</p>

<p>Second Special District Vegetable Market Stallholders Association</p>
<h3>Approved by the Municipal Party Department for Organization</h3>
<p>—Registered with the French Consul General's Office Yesterday—</p>
<p>There are over ten vegetable markets within the French Concession of this city. The number of vegetable stall vendors is approximately five to six thousand. However, most of these vendors have limited education and knowledge, and lack a sense of unity, resulting in extreme disorganization. Zhang Shaofu, Wu Ren, Zhao Zhixiang, Yu Zude, Pan Lianyuan, Yu Kaitang, Chen A'jiao, Sun Jingyuan, Zhu A'san, Wu Guanda, Song Xiaomao, Pan Lanyun, Yin Caifu, Chen Yunqing, Jin Yongkang, Gu Gensheng, Zhu Qingheng, Wo Zhiqing, Hu Deyi, Zhu A'zhong, Yao Linggen, Shi Zhongxin, Guo Yongfa, Xu A'hua, Zhu Yuhai, Xu Guanming, Xu Jintang, Zheng Kexiang, Sheng Jinfa, Yuan Jiaxiang, and Li A'fu—thirty-one vendors from the Eight Immortals Bridge Vegetable Market, Benping Bridge Vegetable Market, and Julei Road Vegetable Market—are clear-headed, enthusiastic about their work, and trusted by all the vegetable vendors. They jointly signed and stamped a petition to organize the Second Special District Vegetable Market Stall Vendors United Benefit Association, submitting it to the Municipal Party Department for approval. The Municipal Party Department has now approved the request, issuing License No. 153. Upon receiving the license, Zhang Shaofu and others will immediately convene the original initiators to begin preparations. It is reported that each vegetable market will organize a branch, electing a number of representatives to attend meetings. From these representatives, executive and supervisory committee members will be elected to form the Second Special District Vegetable Market Stall Vendors United Benefit Association as the central hub. The names of the branches will be such as the Eight Immortals Bridge Vegetable Market branch, to be called the Second Special District Vegetable Market Stall Vendors United Benefit Association Eight Immortals Bridge Branch. Furthermore, it is understood that the association yesterday followed the concession regulations, submitting a document to the French Consul General's Office in Shanghai for registration.</p>
<h3>Record of the Meeting of Merchant and Vendor Representatives on Jiangyin Street</h3>
<p>Representative Yan is Respectable for Not Being Lured by Personal Gain</p>
<p>Notice to All Merchants and Vendors: Strictly Prevent Sabotage</p>
<p>The Committee for Maintaining the Original Site of the Vegetable Market by Merchants, Residents, and Vegetable Vendors on Jiangyin Street held its ninth representative meeting yesterday. Fourteen representatives attended, and Du Jinbao was publicly elected as chairman, with Zhou Gengsheng as the recorder. After the formalities, the chairman reported that recently, a scoundrel named Yuan Sanmei attempted to undermine the unity of the committee by suddenly approaching Representative Yan Hongxiang, urging him to resign from his position and join their pseudo-organization, presenting a deceptive petition to the authorities, requesting approval to build a vegetable market on Chezhan Road to profit from it. He offered a bribe of three hundred yuan as an incentive for Yan to resign. Fortunately, Representative Yan was not lured by personal gain, recognizing the serious impact on the livelihoods of the masses. He sternly rebuked the scoundrel, who, failing in his scheme, fled in disgrace. We should express our respect for Representative Yan's noble character and protection of public interests. At this point, all the representatives stood up to pay their respects to Yan Hongxiang. The chairman then stated that since the scoundrel was intentionally trying to sabotage, it was necessary to guard against further deceitful schemes and disturbances. It was resolved that all merchants, residents, and vegetable vendors should be vigilant and strictly prevent further incitement and sabotage. Any discoveries should be reported to the five chief representatives for handling. The chairman also proposed that the committee had previously petitioned the authorities to withdraw the decision, and the Public Works Bureau had replied, stating that a letter had been sent to the Finance Bureau to convene a committee to discuss the construction of the vegetable market. However, the Finance Bureau had not yet responded, causing anxiety among the vendors who were eagerly awaiting the cancellation of the construction. It was decided to prepare a document petitioning the Finance Bureau to expedite the approval and cancellation of the construction to reassure the public. The meeting adjourned after the discussion.</p>

Upon discovering the fire, the factory staff immediately called the Songshan Road Fire Brigade, which rushed to the scene to extinguish the flames. The fire was extinguished after more than half an hour. The entire second floor was burned down, along with a large number of machines and woolen goods, resulting in losses estimated at over ten thousand yuan.</p>

<h3>Wang Zhichang Dies Tragically</h3>
<p>At around 10:30 AM yesterday, near the railway track approximately two hundred paces north of the Zhongshan Road bridge on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway, an elderly man of about sixty years old was walking south when a passenger train speeding from Shanghai to Hangzhou struck him from behind.

<p>Liangyao Shui Soliciting Exchange for 2,000 Boxes</p>
<p>Following a family-inherited ancient formula for treating epidemic diseases, Mr. Zhang Zhenlu invited famous Chinese and Western doctors to appraise and personally supervise the production of "Liangyao Shui," which has accumulated miraculous effects and spread widespread praise. However, due to Mr. Zhang's inability to give it away widely, he limited annual production to 10,000 boxes, with 20 bottles per box, to be exchanged according to the original method, priced at one yuan each. This year, in addition to the old customers who have exchanged them over the years, there are still over 2,000 boxes remaining, which are still being exchanged by the Liangchen Haoyou Company at the intersection of Shanghai Road and Zhejiang Road.

<h3>The Chicago Authorities Sing the Western Chamber</h3>
<p>— Zhan Lu</p>
<p>I only thought that this year would be the "year of open nudism," but who knew that there would be setbacks everywhere. The nudist movement in Shatin, Hong Kong, is very depressed, and there is quite a scene of "Wang Xiaoer celebrating the New Year, each year is worse than the last"; other nudist movements in Harbin and Shanghai have also failed to receive a warm welcome from society. Most people say: "The sense of shame is innate to everyone. The land of clothing and culture should not have this strange phenomenon." But those who are keen on nudism are sighing frequently, saying: "There are three hundred and sixty naked insects, and humans are the longest among them. This is seen in the Family Sayings of Confucius. Why should humans hide the fact that they are naked insects? Once clothed, people's nature is obscured. Promoting nudism is not only beneficial to the body, but also can restore inherent personality. Why oppose it?" The thinking of the people of the New World is of course newer than that of the people of the Old World. The "not wearing a thread" doctrine cannot be practiced in the Old World, and it should be practiced in the New World; however, in fact, it is not so. In Chicago, someone proposed to enclose an area in a certain park, set up wooden fences around it, to allow 10,000 naked people to sunbathe inside. However, the Chicago authorities strictly rejected the proposed wooden fence. Afterwards, they told people with a bit of humorous tone; he said: "The wooden fence as a park wall still has the possibility of being spied on while bathing; if you want to cut off spying, unless the wooden fence is as high as the sky." Hey! The Chicago authorities are actually singing the Western Chamber. Zhang Sheng is nailed to the top of the stake, "Only that step away," the person went inside, and Zhang Sheng couldn't see her, so he sang the line "The pink wall is as high as the blue sky." No matter how high the pink wall is built, it can't be as high as the blue sky. Zhang Sheng is inevitably exaggerating; unexpectedly, the Chicago authorities also have this kind of ideal. If a wooden fence as high as the sky is built, it will be called "The wooden fence is as high as the blue sky." With this sky-high wooden fence, many American Zhang Shengs would see it and wouldn't sing: "Looking until through, swallowing saliva in vain"?</p>
<p>Nudism cannot prevail because there is an invisible wall as high as the sky there acting as a barrier. What is this wall called? It's called the "wall of shame." If you can't knock down this "wall of shame," then the "naked insect world" will have no possibility of realization; it seems that the day of the "open movement" is not a matter of dawn or dusk. Those who are keen on nudism should quickly put away the "not wearing a thread" doctrine, and wait a few years or ten years before making a decision.</p>
<h3>Summer Nights in a Small Town</h3>
<p>— Yun Lian</p>
<p>The summer nights of the city have been written too exhaustively by comrades who play with pens; I have no blessing to enjoy the summer nights of the countryside; although I have temporarily avoided the noise of the city, the low-energy urban microcosm still reflects in my eyes; the Chenghuang Temple in the small town has an open-air cinema, lights, and small games; the County Party Department wants the people to understand the tragic and fierce situation of the bloody battles against Japan in the Northeast! Several military films were transported, and since there was no cinema, they were shown in the open air of the Chenghuang Temple. The vast and boundless patio was actually full of men and women, opening their eyes; at least they had seen a "shadow play" once. As for resisting Japan or not? It's not the point, so this crowd, it is said: the first is to watch a free show without spending money, and the second is to see so many mysterious "living ghost shadows," and think that a new era has opened in their life history; the Yangzhou troupe in the moonlit night is also the only place for entertainment. The Yangzhou troupe is also taught to be "Shaobo boys"; the people of Jiangnan call the Suzhou dialect Wu Nong soft words, and the people of Jiangbei regard the Yangzhou dialect as the first choice. This Shaobo opera uses the Yangzhou dialect, singing ballad-style lyrics, and there are still people who accompany yellow-faced women, bring late-night snacks, and make the most of the night's enjoyment; but when the old men and wives hear about it, they will purse their lips, shake their heads, and talk about it as news.</p>
<p>Soldiers collapsed, soldiers collapsed, soldiers collapsed, this is an implication of selling "Taoist love songs" along the street waiting for customers, drip-tap, drip-tap, is another kind of "knocking plates" singer, and there is another kind of Jianghu street performer taught to be "next door opera." "Singing Taoist love songs" and "knocking plates" are slightly higher-class beggars, they don't beg from door to door; people who are rolling up their legs and sleeves to cool off, hearing these kinds of sounds, there will be good people who stand up as initiators, and a certain kind of street performer will naturally happily sing his masterpiece at the top of his voice, and as soon as a song is finished, the initiator will shout loudly to the surrounding audience: "Everyone help one person", please viewers generously donate, each taking out one or two copper coins. Old people, hearing their children and grandchildren also learn to hum the Taoist love song tune, will immediately order: "Taoist love song can't be learned", if you learn it in the 22nd month, you can't escape going on the Jianghu, it is said that this is a family motto passed down, knocking plates to sell songs seems to only prevail on inland river ships, only this next-door opera is indeed a kind of ventriloquism, quite artistic, Wang sells plaster, Li grinds tofu, which is the most appreciated by the audience, can imitate southern and northern accents, can imitate the sounds of chickens crowing and dogs barking; unfortunately, the sound of soldiers collapsing and dripping, drip-tap in the ears of cooling people is like a five-tone continuous play, ten music Qi Qin, can cause endless joy: in fact, it is nothing more than opium red pills! Some shouts that struggled out of there.</p>

<p>Opening a "movie theater" has a greater effect on moving people than opening a "school."</p>
<p>"Stock exchanges" and "dance halls," "seem unrelated, but have some similarities. Stock exchanges are obsessed with "money," and dance halls are obsessed with "sensuality."</p>
<p>Men and women will never be equal; if a woman takes off her shoes, it is said to be "modern" and "fashionable." If a man takes off his shoes, it is said to be "lower class" and "barefoot."</p>
<p>A "mosquito" in the bed net and a "flea" in the pants can keep you awake all night. A "bad element" in society has the same effect on disrupting order and peace.</p>
<p>There are two kinds of suicides in society: one is tangible suicide, and the other is intangible suicide. Tangible suicide can be treated with first aid. Intangible suicide is really incurable.</p>
<p>To realize the true meaning of "world harmony, equality of mankind," the only way is to promote the "nude movement." The Jiangbei people on the boat are the most vocal advocates of the "nude movement." Look at their "little ones" and "little ducks," who are all naked and unclad all day long, jumping naturally.</p>
<h3>Talking About Apartments in Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Thin Gull</p>
<p>Food, clothing, shelter, and transportation, although said to be the four major elements of life, without one, one cannot live, however, the cost of living is increasing without limit like this, it is really not easy for people to maintain these four things. Especially in Shanghai, and in Shanghai especially, the problem of housing is even more difficult.</p>
<p>I have lived in Shanghai for a full ten years, and moving around, although always because I rented a house alone, I have never been angered by any landlords, but the environment has always not jumped out of the alley, since it is in the alley, there are inevitably many high neighbors around, these high neighbors are not something you can choose yourself, so you will often encounter music connoisseurs who turn on the radio music appreciation all night, and those gambling gentlemen who must play mahjong until dawn every night. It makes you wish you could neither live nor die, and the result can only be to move again, but moving is the most troublesome thing. Then, the only thing to do is to bite the bullet and stick it out!</p>
<p>Recently, I have encountered such an awkward situation again. After thinking again and again, there is no way to solve it, so later, I decided to live in an apartment by myself. Apartments in Shanghai can probably be divided into two types. One is the hotel type, where men and women can live together; the other is the dormitory type, which only accepts single men and women, and even visits by the opposite sex are restricted very strictly, but it is much quieter. As far as I know, there are four such dormitory-style apartments in Shanghai. One is the YMCA, one is the Jiande Association, one is the Hongkou apartment run by the Four Lines Savings Association, and the other is upstairs of the Hongkou branch of the Bank of China. Among these four places, the earliest to be founded was the YMCA, the cheapest rent was the Jiande Association, and the most exquisite houses and the most expensive prices were the Bank of China. Hongkou Apartment is in between the three, and all the equipment and pricing are as flat as the horizontal line. So I moved into the Hongkou apartment, ready to spend a summer and then leave.</p>
<p>I have read the regulations of these four apartments, and they all have expressed a willingness to accommodate criticisms from guests. In my opinion, other things are not so important, but not preparing mats in the summer and teaching Chinese guests to sleep on very thick sheets like foreigners seems too Westernized. I would very much like their managers to pay attention to this point. ) Jiande Apartment has mats (</p>
<h3>Four Northeast Company Commanders</h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 12: Poor and Humble Join the Army with Suffering, Sickly Husband Falls Behind, Sacrifice is Willing to Give Up Military Service, Many Affectionate Soldiers</p>
<p>If it's said to him in the future, maybe on the day of the happy event, he won't be able to get away. Wouldn't that be a joke? Fortunately, in these past two days, the Zhao family has not mentioned the marriage. Vaguely, if we can muddle through one day, we'll muddle through one day. If we muddle through ten days or half a month, and I don't open my mouth, maybe the Zhao family will know that we are unwilling. Then, they won't mention it in the future. Madam Jiang thought of such a stupid idea. From the second day onwards, not only did she refuse to make any expression, but she also didn't go to the back yard much. For the first two or three days, Old Man Zhao didn't mind, but after a week, Old Man Zhao knew that things were not good. When Zhao Ziqiang came back this day, Old Man Zhao only told him that the Yang family had not mentioned the marriage, and it wouldn't matter to say it again in two days. Zhao Ziqiang didn't suspect that things had changed and went back to the camp frankly.</p>
<p>After two days, he came back again. Old Man Zhao had a dry tobacco pipe in his mouth and was lying on a sleeping chair, just smoking. After a long time, he said: I can see Mrs. Yang's meaning. She feels that you are a soldier and can't often stay at home. She only has this daughter, and she always hopes that her son-in-law will often be in front of her eyes. You are a person with official duties, how can this be done, so she is very indifferent. Zhao Ziqiang, during this half a month, was originally very tired of military life. Hearing that the Yang family's daughter was unwilling to marry a soldier, he not only did not dislike the Yang family's repentance, but also felt that the other party's attitude was appropriate. So he lowered his head and sat on the chair opposite his father, and didn't say anything for a long time. Old Man Zhao had a pipe in his mouth and smoked loudly. After a long time, he finally said: What do you think of this matter? It always takes both parties to be willing to climb relatives, and there can be no compulsion. Now Mrs. Yang and her daughter are unwilling. If we force their will to succeed, then if everyone is unhappy in the future, then what's the point? Zhao Ziqiang was still sitting with his head lowered, unable to say what he wanted to say in his heart. After a long time, he half-raised his head, but sighed.) 147 (</p>

<h3>Countryside Diary</h3>
<p>— Zhang Yiping</p>
<p>The sun had just peeked its head from the east when our small boat had already been rocking for a while. My younger cousin was punting at the bow, and I was sculling at the stern, watching the mirror-like river surface shattered by the boat's progress. At the same time, the sun's reflection looked like countless golden snakes about to surge from the water.</p>
<p>Because of a casual remark made while enjoying the cool evening air last night, my cousin was determined to rent a boat and go to the countryside this morning. In fact, neither of us was familiar with the waterways, nor did we know where the villages and towns were. We simply moved forward along the official canal, one punt, one scull at a time. Gradually, we were separated from the city walls, and the banks were filled with collapsed cowsheds, or perhaps a few thatched cottages, quietly nestled there like dying lamps. Ahead was the blue sky, connected to the water's surface. Rarely did villagers heading to the city pass by, and even the stray dogs in the fields by the bridge seemed tired and lay down. Here was peace and tranquility. We stopped working and sat down, each at the bow and stern, the boat carried backward along the shore with the rising tide. A foot-powered boat going to and from the city overtook us. They hoisted huge sails, as if soaring into the sky.</p>
<p>"Smooth sailing!" the cousin at the bow exclaimed.</p>
<p>I didn't answer. I stared at a villager approaching. I stood up at the stern and shouted loudly, "Hey, please tell me, where is this place?"</p>
<p>The villager took a few steps forward as if startled, and I clearly saw his face—it was the gatekeeper of my family's graveyard.</p>
<p>"Afa, is it not far from my family's graves?" I asked, pretending to be clever.</p>
<p>"Ha, young master, what brings you to the countryside? To visit the graves, you need to dock over there," he said, pointing behind us. "Ahead is Liuqiaowan. I just came from home."</p>
<p>"Good, let's go to Afa's house!" my cousin shouted from the bow.</p>
<p>So Afa got off the boat and turned into a small river. We saw a small village, and our boat stopped by the small bridge in Liuqiaowan. By this time, the sun was directly overhead. The villagers had already eaten, and many half-naked children were gathered around the bridge. A small child shouted, "Foreigners are here!"</p>
<p>Afa's wife warmly brought out two basins of water for us to wash ourselves. We took out the food we had brought on the boat and moved it to the cowshed by the bridge. Stripped to the waist, we raised our feet and devoured our fill, giving the leftovers to the surrounding children.</p>
<p>Gusts of wind blew from all directions, or relentlessly shone the sun upon us. The rice in the fields was already half a person tall, swayed by the wind, looking like beautiful waves. "Just sitting here for a day and a night would not be in vain," I thought.</p>
<p>Afa said, "Liuqiaowan" has a little more than twenty households. The foot-powered boats from the city also stop here, so this town is quite famous. The teahouse ahead is for people traveling by boat to nearby towns." He pointed to the tallest building.</p>
<p>Of course, as if discovering a famous historical site, we put on our clothes and went to the teahouse for sightseeing. Stepping onto the stairs, we almost startled the tea-drinking villagers, because we were wearing Western suits. Afa quickly stepped forward and said, "Tiger, these are young masters from the city. Brew a pot of light tea."</p>
<p>The one called Tiger busily dragged a rag, wiped the tables and stools clean, poured us two cups of tea, and stood aside.</p>
<p>Leaning against the window, in front of us were fields of rice half a person tall. A river, like branches, ran through the middle. The widest part of the river was probably the official canal. I said to my cousin, "Why didn't we see any small harbors when we came?" I couldn't help but laugh.</p>
<p>The two of us sat at the bow, watching the twilight envelop the earth, the bright moon hanging overhead, and returned as if hypnotized.</p>

The election has now been completed, and the ballots have been returned successively. The ballots were counted at 2:00 PM on the 1st of this month in the Society's Biler Hall. Cai Yuanpei supervised the director ballots, and Shen Xinqing supervised the councilor ballots. The results are as follows:</p>
<p>The elected directors are: Huang Renzhi (80 votes), Qian Xinzhi (69 votes), Wang Rutang (36 votes), Wang Yiting (34 votes), Xu Jingren (22 votes). The alternates are: Jiang Wenyu (19 votes), Zhang Gongquan (13 votes), and Zhu Ziqiao (13 votes).

<p>The elected councilors are: Wang Yunwu (504 votes), Pan Gongzhan (346 votes), Guo Bingwen (338 votes), Gu Yinting (338 votes), and Pan Xulun (307 votes). The alternates are: Liao Maoru (285 votes), Gao Jian (245 votes), Ou Yuanhuai (192 votes), Xu Qiufan (122 votes), and Chen Jicheng (110 votes). The councilors whose terms have not expired are: Cai Yuanpei, Zhu Jingnong, Tao Zhixing, Liu Zhanen, Wang Zhihua, Chen Binhe, Du Chongyuan, Guo Bingwen, Zhang Gongquan, and Jia Furu. The China Vocational Education Society has always attached great importance to research work. Mr. Chen Xuan shan was in charge of this department. Now that Mr. Chen has been hired by the Chinese Education Office of the Ministry of Industry as the deputy director, the Society has specially hired Mr. He Qingru to succeed him, and also serve as the editor-in-chief. Mr. He has a Ph.D. in philosophy from the United States, specializing in vocational education. He has written many books on vocational guidance, personnel management, and other subjects. Recently, he served as the registrar of National Tsinghua University. Because of his close relationship with the Society, he resigned from Tsinghua University and came to Shanghai to take the job.</p>

<h3>Expansion of East China Girls' High School</h3>
<p>East China Girls' High School on Xujiahui Road, Belle Road, in this city, has been established for two years. School directors Wang Yansong, Wang Yunwu, Wu Kaixian, Zheng Hongnian, Zhou Feicheng, and Principal Ma Jiazhen and others, plan and manage the school with tireless efforts. The school takes equal emphasis on intellectual, moral, and physical education as its governing policy, hoping to cultivate healthy citizens with noble morals, strong physique, and excellent knowledge. In addition to the ordinary junior and senior high school courses, the school offers a normal school course. Starting this semester, a business course will be added and first-year students will be recruited. The curriculum of the school's normal school course is taught by people who have researched and have rich experience in primary school education, which is very suitable for the needs of scholars. Therefore, the students of this subject have a unique understanding. This semester is limited by the Ministry's order to suspend the recruitment of first-year students, but it will still recruit transfer students for the subject. However, their qualifications must meet the regulations of the normal school regulations. It is also learned that the number of students has increased sharply in the past year, and the original school buildings are not enough to use. Many new bungalows have been added to be used as dormitories and classrooms. It is also reported that the school directors Wang Yansong and others are determined to develop the school into the most complete girls' high school in Shanghai, and plan to build school buildings within a year. Principal Ma Jiazhen has prepared a proposal and submitted it to the school board for approval, and then will actively proceed.</p>
<h3>Regulations for Free Tuition at Zhaohe Middle School</h3>
<p>Since the establishment of Zhaohe Middle School, considering the current economic depression of society and the urgent need to alleviate the burden of schooling for young people, in addition to a special reduction in tuition fees (20 yuan for high school and 15 yuan for junior high school), regulations have been established to provide preferential treatment to the descendants of martyrs who founded Zhaohe and other revolutionary and anti-Japanese martyrs. Furthermore, a set of regulations for reducing or waiving tuition fees for ordinary students has been formulated, with the content roughly stipulating the following: 1) Orphans from impoverished families with no support who are striving for progress; 2) Those who have experienced war zones in previous wars since September 18th, whose families have suffered devastation, and who are unable to afford schooling (the situation in Shanghai's January 28th Incident is similar); 3) Those recommended by the school board of directors for special requests for tuition reduction or waiver; 4) Those with excellent character and academics, with exceptional grades (requiring continuous grades of 90 or above for more than one year); 5) Others approved by the school board of directors may obtain a request form for tuition reduction or waiver from the principal's office one month before the start of the semester, and have it certified and recommended by local government officials or at least two reputable merchants. The form is then submitted to the school's tuition reduction/waiver review committee, which forwards it to the principal for approval of the reduction or waiver. The levels are divided into approximately four grades, which will be determined based on the applicant's circumstances. Detailed regulations can be obtained by sending a stamped self-addressed envelope. The school's second examination period is scheduled to be held at 9:00 AM on the 10th of this month.</p>
<p>[P Qinghua Middle School Establishes a Girls' Division &gt;</p>
<p>Recently, due to a surge in female students, the private Qinghua Middle School will establish a girls' division starting from the autumn semester, exclusively admitting female students in all grades of junior high school. The school has been established for seven years and is known for its excellent performance. In the upcoming term, a committee system will be adopted, with committees established for each department: academics, guidance, general affairs, middle school, girls', and elementary school, each responsible for their respective duties. The school adopts a combined training and education approach for guiding students. The library and reading room of the school have been specially expanded to two large rooms on the second floor. Since the elementary school department was registered with the Municipal Education Bureau, the majority of students participating in the joint examinations have graduated. A grading system will also be adopted in the upcoming term, and classes will be held as usual on Saturday afternoons. The school's collection of tuition fees and other items are generally based on fixed regulations, ensuring that parents do not incur any additional burdens beyond what is required to be paid. Detailed regulations can be obtained by writing to the admissions committee of the school at Meibaige Road, Racecourse.</p>
<h3>Chenguang Vocational School Receives Equipment</h3>

<h3>Lost to Saint Thomas University 1-3</h3>
<p>(Minala Dispatch) Our country's sports are increasingly developing abroad. Football has a firm grip on the reins of East Asia, conquering the south and west with its valiant prowess. Now, volleyball and basketball teams are also rising up to become stronger, showing great promise. Therefore, the calls for expeditions are also rising following the football team, truly a good phenomenon in the country's sports world. The Fudan University volleyball team on Jiangwan Road in Shanghai has dominated the Jiangnan region for more than ten years. It has previously ventured domestically to the northeastern provinces and even Japan, with excellent results. The players are not complacent and seek to learn from others. Taking advantage of the summer vacation, they organized a volleyball tour team to the south. This time, they will compete along the ports of Fujian and Guangdong. On the 22nd of this month, they boarded the President Bias ship in Hong Kong, taking the route to Minala en route to Singapore. The team of eighteen arrived in Minala at 7:00 PM on the 24th. The secretary of the Chinese consulate and many Chinese and foreign reporters boarded the ship to welcome them. After Secretary Ye completed the disembarkation procedures, the entire team took cars to visit Consul-General Kuang at the consulate. Consul-General Kuang and Mr. Lin Zhuguang hosted a banquet for the entire team at the Pinfang Restaurant at 11:00 AM.</p>
<p>According to the leader of the team, Chen Bingde, the main focus of this trip is on volleyball. As for the basketball team accompanying the expedition, it is organized by the volleyball team members and is not the entire team of Fudan University. It is simply a single organization of some players from the volleyball team. In the competition in Xiamen, the volleyball team won 3-1 against Luguang, 3-1 against Jianqun, 3-1 against Zhangzhou, and 3-1 against Xialian. The basketball team lost all five games. In Xiamen, for ten days before and after, the basketball team had a record of two wins in three games in Shantou, first defeating the Shantou Sports Association and then Yinghua Academy, losing only to the Shanghua team. The volleyball team won one game against Tuojiang and then defeated the Shantou Sports Association again.</p>
<p>The team did not practice when passing through Hong Kong. To relax from the life on the ship, upon landing, they entrusted the local sports community to arrange a friendly competition with various Filipino friendly teams, each in basketball and volleyball. They obtained the agreement of the Saint Thomas University team, which won this year's Philippine volleyball championship, to compete at the Youth Association Sports Field at 4:00 PM in the afternoon. However, due to rain, it was changed temporarily to the Philippine Student Youth Association. The referee was Mr. Li Feiyun, the Shanghai Nanshang coach. At 5:30 PM, Referee Li summoned the captains of both teams.</p>
<p>After making the choice of the field, they divided into bases and set up formations. With the sound of the silver whistle, a battle of dragons and tigers began. Saint Thomas University is the volleyball champion of this year's Philippine Group A, with five volleyball stars of the Far East. With mature cooperation, and taking advantage of their rest, they were active from the start, pressing forward in every section. Fortunately, Fudan's front and rear guards coordinated well in defense. In the first game, Fudan won 22-20.</p>
<p>In the second game, the Filipino team repeatedly used its front-row center's spiking and the second-row right's smashing to win 16-21. In the third game, the Filipino team won again 22-20. The last game was a matter of life and death for both teams, and the battle became even fiercer. The Filipino second-row right consecutively scored four points, throwing our formation into chaos. The opponent took advantage of the situation to win easily 14-21.</p>
<p>In all fairness, the Fudan team only landed yesterday, had not practiced, and faced such a strong opponent. To achieve such a result is commendable. The basketball team also lost to the Chinese Youth Association.</p>

<p>Zhou Jieming, Mei Fenxi (Below), Zhou Zhiman (Above)</p>
<p>Qiu Guangxie, Chen Bocai (Below)</p>
<p>Regarding the expenses of this trip, the team leader announced to the press that in addition to the school's donation of 500 yuan, each person paid 100 yuan. The expenses of this trip are extensive, so there is still a shortage. The income from the competition in Singapore will be used to make up for the shortfall in Fudan's trip to the south. Therefore, if there are good results in Singapore, they will decide to return to the country via Minala, at which time they can make a longer stay.</p>

<h3>Youth and Using National Goods</h3>
<p>— Yang An</p>
<p>Mr. Xiang Kangyuan is a practitioner of promoting national goods, with keen ideas and resolute actions. He once said that cultivating the habit of using national goods among the people should start from schools, and the responsibility of elementary school teachers is even more important. Transforming education from rigid to lively, and from passive thrift to active and scientific consumption, is the most important task today. If we do not think from the root, the national goods business will only have a way in but no way out, and we will see that the more it is promoted, the more stagnant the funds will become. This is not a way to get to the root of the problem, and the future is full of dangers. Looking around the country, the most knowledgeable, far-sighted, and patriotic are the educators, who are responsible for training the youth of the country and making everyone have the habit of using national goods. If the current situation continues, where everyone prioritizes comfort and beauty, and feels that they must use foreign goods for clothing, food, housing, and transportation, then the more developed education becomes, the more misfortunes the national goods industry will face. Whether the result of education is meritorious or sinful is a matter for deep reflection. Mr. Xiang's proposal for saving the country with one yuan is actively being planned. Recently, at the China National Goods Production and Sales Cooperation Association, he proposed a method for a National Goods Reward Association for Youth, based on all his ideas. He said that if all parties agree and implement this measure, assuming a standard of 100,000 yuan, Mr. Xiang is willing to add 5,000 yuan from his children's education fund to initiate it. His enthusiasm and determination moved everyone present. The outline of the method is briefly introduced as follows:</p>
<p>1) Purpose: To cultivate the habit of using national goods among students of all levels, from elementary school to university, as the most thorough way to promote national goods.</p>
<p>2) Certification: Students of all levels from elementary school to university, regardless of the examination they are taking, must have a certificate from the school principal certifying that they are using national goods in order to take the examination.</p>
<p>3) Scholarship Regulations: Stipulate the number of scholarships to reward excellent students: 1) 300 elementary school students, 2) 100 middle school students, 3) 30 university students.</p>
<p>4) Employment: When employing talents needed by various factories and referring talents by employment agencies, priority will be given to the students who have obtained awards in this examination. In addition, the trainees used by various factories and companies each year will also be selected from these students.</p>
<p>5) Cooperative: Establish consumer cooperatives widely, with the same consumer cooperative organizations in various places and schools. The goods sold must be strictly reviewed and all be genuine domestic products.</p>
<p>6) Funding: First, raise a fund, using the interest as the association's funding. Also, negotiate with enthusiastic national goods factories to agree to use 2% of the net profit as the association's fund, in order to gradually expand and make the business grow day by day. This method is extremely important and effective. It is hoped that educators and industrialists will discuss it together, reconcile it to the most appropriate point, and strongly support its success, so that it can become a reality as soon as possible, and it is also a matter worth commemorating in the National Goods Year.</p>
<p>Talking about National Goods</p>
<h3>The Joy of Marriage</h3>
<p>— Shi Dian</p>
<p>Marriage is the happiest thing in life.</p>
<p>"The wedding night in the bridal chamber, one night is worth a thousand gold." Even the ancient people who called themselves moralists had such romantic thoughts and actions; we modern people are of course no exception. Therefore, unmarried young men, as soon as the wedding date approaches, cheer and jump, longing for the arrival of the auspicious day; unmarried virgins, when they are about to be married, seem very calm on the outside, shy and speechless, but the joy and enthusiastic expectation in their hearts is naturally undeniable.</p>
<p>As the wedding date approaches, the parents of both parties are ecstatic. The groom's side is busy preparing brand new furniture and belongings, and the bride's side is busy preparing a generous dowry. This probably has two meanings: on the one hand, it is because parents love their children and are eager to take this so-called happy occasion to buy more things for them as a memorial to their parents' love. On the other hand, it contains the implication of hoping that they will be able to live more independently after they are married.</p>
<p>This is a praiseworthy act. But the big question of whether marriage can always allow enjoyment of happiness lies in this praiseworthy act.</p>
<p>The reason is this: most Chinese people have a traditional habit of worshiping foreign goods, believing that foreign goods are always beautiful, durable, and reliable. Therefore, when purchasing a dowry, they do not hesitate to spend a lot of money to search for foreign goods, especially the so-called inexpensive, good-quality, lightweight, and durable Oriental goods, which are even more welcomed by them. At the same time, in Chinese customs, the size of a wedding dowry is related to the family's reputation. They often spend all the family's money, even borrowing money from others at high interest rates to purchase it, which is a huge sum of money earned by foreigners!</p>
<p>Foreigners who earn this huge sum of money will never thank us; instead, they will use this money to build up their military and invade our country. The fact that the Japanese are now plundering our Northeast, Rehe, and threatening our Tianjin and Beijing is ironclad.</p>
<p>The enemy's iron cavalry is approaching day by day, and we may become slaves of a fallen country soon. The slaves of a fallen country will never enjoy the joy of marriage again. Here, I will first prove the facts:</p>
<p>[Korean men and women are not allowed to marry until they are 45 years old. Before marriage, the first step is to buy a marriage certificate, which costs 100 yuan. The second step is to investigate the person's occupation. If they have no occupation, they are still not allowed to marry. The third step is that if they have an occupation but do not speak Japanese, they must study for three years. If the man and woman have ambition and spirit, it will be difficult to graduate even after three years, and they must continue studying for three years.]</p>
<p>According to the May 9th News</p>
<p>Such a marriage is really a living hell! How can there be any "joy"!</p>
<p>Now, we should take advantage of the last five minutes before the enemy's iron cavalry tramples on our own heads, quickly use national goods, and kill the enemy economically, so that we can continue to enjoy the "joy of marriage".</p>
<p>Otherwise, once the enemy's iron cavalry arrives, we may not be like the Koreans, and we will immediately have a "marriage of unhappiness"!</p>
<p>People who live in a realistic ivory tower and live in drunken stupor, now is our last chance to wake up!</p>
<p>This is what I am willing to propose two central propositions to contribute to the public in order to maintain the eternal "joy of marriage" of our Chinese nation.</p>
<p>1) Unmarried young men and virgins, if you want to enjoy the "joy of marriage", you should quickly use national goods!</p>
<p>2) Married gentlemen, masters, young ladies, and old ladies, if you want your children and grandchildren to enjoy the "joy of marriage", you should quickly use national goods!</p>
<p>Discussion of National Goods</p>
<h3>Promoting National Goods to the Countryside?</h3>
<p>I haven't been home for more than half a year. The six or seven days I spent back home this time only gave me a pessimistic impression. Leaving aside other things, let's just talk about national goods! It's really terrible. They don't know what "national goods" are? It's even harder to get them to use "national goods". In their slow and foolish minds, there are only names like "foreign goods," "goods from elsewhere," "foreign goods," "Western," "Eastern," etc. In the countryside, except for agricultural products and local goods, foreign goods are everywhere. Even if there are a small amount of national goods, they also regard them as foreign goods. It's funny and annoying to say it. Of course, we can't blame them. It's a matter of education level.</p>
<p>Some people say that the salesmen of foreign goods are fashionable women and young people in the city, and the merchants who sell foreign goods are also in the city. Therefore, to promote national goods, it must be done in the city, so national goods exhibitions are also opened in the city. I am not opposed to doing this, but we must know that this is mutually causal. The less national goods go to the countryside, the more estranged they are from the villagers, the less faith they get from the villagers, and the fewer people who like to use them. And the more opportunities foreign goods have to invade, the more the villagers believe in foreign goods and distrust national goods. This cyclical mutual cause and effect is why national goods should be promoted to the countryside as soon as possible to break this cyclical cause and effect.</p>
<p>If we look at it from a broader perspective, our country has always been based on agriculture. Among the 400 million compatriots, 340 million are farmers, plus millions of small workers and small businessmen, accounting for more than 85% of the national population. If each person uses one jiao of foreign goods on average, wouldn't tens of millions of yuan flow abroad? If we compare this number with the foreign goods money flowing out of the city, which is more or less? In order to recover the tens of millions of yuan flowing out of the countryside, we must also promote national goods to the countryside.</p>
<p>Promote national goods to the countryside!</p>
<p>Introduction to National Goods</p>
<h3>Introducing National Goods Bicycles</h3>
<p>— Yi Ju</p>
<p>Bicycles are rarely made in our country. Most of them are imported from abroad. In recent years, domestic transportation in our country has become more and more convenient, and the need for bicycles has also increased as a result. Therefore, the number of imported foreign bicycles each year is very large, but few Chinese people pay attention to them, which is not a good plan.</p>
<p>Daxing Bicycle Shop on Miller Road, Hongkou, is the first company to manufacture national goods bicycles. Since its introduction to the market, it has been praised by people in the country, so its sales are also very good. It is hoped that people from all walks of life will pay attention to it.</p>
<p>The factory manufactures the latest type of luggage car, which can be freely loaded and unloaded without furniture and can be placed in a box of less than three feet square, which is very convenient for transportation by boat and car. It is truly a new invention of national goods bicycles.</p>
<h3>Random Thoughts</h3>
<p>— Tian Ying</p>
<p>1) Promoting National Goods and Foreign Languages</p>
<p>I really don't understand why the Chinese people's belief in foreigners is so deep? Everything is considered glorious with a bit of foreign style. Look; National Goods Companies, National Goods Shopping Malls, National Goods XX..., the goods in them are of course 100% domestic products, but the trademarks, factory names, factory addresses, and even the instructions for use on the products are all in foreign languages; even if there are a few Chinese characters, they are only on the hidden back of the box, the bottom of the box, or the inner layer of the goods: if they are not displayed in "National Goods XX", they have the glory of being qualified as "goods from elsewhere", is it that national goods are not enough to be promoted without this?</p>
<p>2) Promoting National Goods and Advertising</p>
<p>The high-sounding words of promoting national goods have been sung for a long time, but looking back at the sales of products from various national goods factories, they are far less broad and fast than foreign goods. The reasons for this are of course very complicated; among them, "advertising" accounts for a very important force in the sales of products. If there is a new product that is not advertised, the people will simply not know that such a thing exists. Even if it is convenient to use and very economical, who will pay attention to it? The author hopes that the famous national goods factories will not begrudge the small advertising fees, but should affect the sales of national goods! (The author is not soliciting business for newspapers)</p>
<p>3) Promoting National Goods and Decoration</p>
<p>Decoration is to products as clothing is to people. Although it is only a superficial form, it seems to be irrelevant to reality; however, for example, if a high-class merchant wears ragged clothes, even if he is honest and reliable, no one will trust him. The same is true for goods. They need an appearance. As the saying goes, "buy an appearance." Without "buying an appearance," no matter how high the quality and low the price of your goods are, they will not be popular.</p>
<p>Many national goods do not pay attention to decoration, and there are many cases where poor decoration affects the sales of goods!</p>
<p>4) Promoting National Goods and Resisting Goods</p>
<p>To make national goods sell well, resisting goods is also a passive way. But looking back at the past achievements of resisting goods, it is really shocking. Resisting goods was originally intended to be implemented voluntarily by various manufacturers, because customers are easily deceived by "changing faces." Now that there are still unscrupulous merchants who have lost their conscience, taking advantage of the dumping of X goods, they buy them in bulk, regardless of the restraints on the sales of national goods, then in addition to the "improvement of products" and "small profits but quick turnover" of various national goods factories, there is no way to fight against them.</p>
<p>In short, promoting national goods is not only up to customers to promote them. Various manufacturers should use appropriate methods to make their products popular and willing to be purchased by the general public!</p>
<h3>The Splendor of Silk and Satin</h3>
<p>— Liu Zengwei</p>
<p>Since ancient times in our country, wearing silk and satin has been considered a way to show off, so the silk and satin business was naturally not bad. Unexpectedly, after the opening of the sea ban, foreign goods poured in, and our country's silk and satin industry was defeated by foreign "what-not" yarn and "what-not" crepe. As a result, no one cared about silk and satin piece by piece, and they had to spend their days coldly in the shop windows.</p>
<p>The owners of the silk and satin shops became anxious when they saw that business was not booming. Therefore, they focused on improvement, greatly embellishing the silk and satin. They made the dull colors bright and the unattractive patterns elegant. After putting in a lot of effort, they were not much inferior to foreign "what-not" yarn and "what-not" crepe.</p>
<p>The owners became happy again and displayed the improved silk and satin, opening an exhibition. When the time came, many gentlemen and ladies came to visit. The silk and satin were also bright and eye-catching, showing off their splendor. The praise of the guests seemed to make the silk and satin even more beautiful, surpassing foreign "what-not" and "what-not."</p>
<p>The exhibition was indeed very lively for a few days. But this is just a temporary excitement, and our promotion of silk and satin should definitely not stop here. We sincerely hope that from now on, those who promote silk and satin will work harder to promote them. On the other hand, manufacturers should work harder to improve them. We must ensure that the price of silk and satin is cheaper than foreign "what-not" yarn and "what-not" crepe, while the quality, color, and pattern are better than theirs. When that day comes, not only will the silk and satin be bright in color, beautiful, and elegant, showing off their splendor, but also a solid foundation for a national goods industry will be laid, and a considerable amount of rights and interests can definitely be recovered.</p>

<h3>Old Stories</h3>
<p>— Xiaoxue</p>
<p>Ye Mengde's "Shilin Bishu Luhua" contains a story about a locust plague. In a year of drought, when Rugao County had a locust plague, the magistrate of the neighboring Taixing County was very proud and reported to the prefect, saying, "We don't have locusts here." Soon, a locust plague broke out in Taixing as well. The prefect questioned the magistrate, who replied that they originally did not have locusts, but the locusts flew in from Rugao. He even sent an official document to Rugao, asking them to "strictly catch the locusts and not allow them to invade neighboring territories." At this time, the magistrate of Rugao County was Qian Mufu. Seeing this official document, he hurriedly picked up his pen and wrote at the end: "Locusts are a natural disaster, not due to the magistrate's incompetence. Since they have flown away from our county, please ask your county to send them back." Soon, this story reached the prefectural government, and everyone regarded it as a laughing stock. Because of the locusts in the Song Dynasty, I thought of the rats of today. The rats of the twentieth century are, after all, different. According to the reports in various newspapers last month, a large number of rats were found in Anhui, not only disturbing the crops but also eating livestock. What was even stranger was that they ate cats and cattle, and even advanced in teams, crossing the river to the south, tiring out the reporters of various newspapers, who reported it with special dispatches as if they were reporting the daily life of a great man. However, although the rats ran across county borders, the magistrates did not have any disputes with each other. Therefore, I realize that modern people are much smarter after all, knowing that they should not take responsibility for natural disasters themselves, and thus do not engage in the sad business of mutual recrimination. Although modern people are said to be smart, they cannot avoid being confused sometimes. I know that there was a joke during the war between Qi and Lu. In Nanjing, the headquarters sent out victory reports every day, saying that our army had advanced a certain number of miles. A few days after the war began, a college student calculated the number of miles advanced. He was so shocked that he stuck out his tongue, because if the number of miles advanced was accurate, the two armies would be fighting in the vast ocean, and the land would have long been conquered. Last year, I read in the newspaper the public telegram of the magistrate of Huoqiu County counterattacking the county seat. The magistrate said that the enemy troops were numerous, while our troops were few; the enemy troops were on the city walls, occupying a superior position, while our troops were under the city walls, making it difficult to resist the enemy. Therefore, the result was that the enemy troops suffered countless casualties, while our troops retreated without any injuries. Reading the two words "without any," I felt a sense of "invulnerability to swords and spears." There are really countless things like this that are both smart and confused. As long as you pay attention to reading the newspaper, you can always discover some every day. Let's put this aside for now and return to talking about rats and jackals. A Central News Agency dispatch from Zhengzhou on July 29 stated that a large number of jackals suddenly appeared in Checun Village, an area in the third district of Songyu County, on the 25th and 26th. They formed groups in broad daylight and bit people whenever they encountered them, causing many casualties among the residents. Various newspapers cherished this news and mostly arranged it in the form of a small tofu square, with a border added to attract readers' attention. In fact, I think it is completely unnecessary. Since rats are rampant, how can jackals not be rampant? Since jackals are already rampant, then "biting people whenever they encounter them, causing many casualties among the residents" is an inevitable and common occurrence. Why be so surprised? If even this is surprising and must be framed with a square border, then every piece of news, if not rigorously verified, will need to be framed. May I ask, Mr. Reporter, where will the newspaper offices find so many frames? Che Ruoshui's "Jiaoqi Ji" says, "While walking in a melon garden, I saw a vicious bee. It caught a cricket, biting it with its mouth and stinging it with its venomous stinger, making it unbearable. How could heaven and earth know, and where could it go to sue? I felt unwell for several days." The bee hurting the cricket already made Ruoshui "feel unwell for several days." If this old man were alive today, I really don't know what he would do. Helpless, I am afraid he could only imitate Su Dongpo and say "Hehe" a few times!</p>
<h3>Dialectics and the Jianghu Secret Formula</h3>
<p>— Gu Fei</p>
<p>A few days ago, I saw a certain gentleman publish his views on observation. Later, in another article, he said that all problems are problems of the method of observation. Simply placing the relationship between creators and objective reality on the function of "observation" is straightforward, but it has already washed away the combativeness of "dialectics" completely. But what is strange is that while Mr. So-and-so castrated dialectics, he also piled up some terms, such as "proactivity," "revolutionary themes," and "opportunities," like making a pyramid poem, making the reader feel as if he had run into Kongming's Bagua Formation.</p>
<p>But I don't want to criticize his theory now, because I can't do it in such a small space, and I haven't read the works he criticized. What I want to say now is a story that Sterk mentioned in "On the Vulgarization of Dialectics."</p>
<p>A "dialectical materialist" used "dialectics" to study the fishing industry in the Far East, saying that "it is still in the initial stage of its 'generation' and birth. It is just beginning to manifest itself." Thus, he based his argument on the fact that fish move with their fins, and then wrote: Fish - in the fishing area, especially in the fishing area after the ban is lifted, is not so much a thorough mechanical (Dynamic) object, but rather should be expressed in philosophical language. From all its categories, it is a process of movement. The clarity of the classical dialectics of the fishing industry economy lies here. Think about it, is there any more strange and fun "dialectics" than this? But let us not forget that such "dialectics" are increasing day by day, and some people are even trying to use this as a pretext to eliminate the combat tasks of dialectics.</p>
<p>I also thought of something else. Not long ago, a friend of mine, because he was usually fond of making direct comments, was forced by the school authorities to dismiss him from his teaching post. He felt that it was too difficult to be a person now and that there was no place to escape. After thinking about it, he came up with the safest way: to use "dialectics" to organize Chinese medicine! When he told me his great wish, I couldn't help but laugh out loud. He immediately said sternly, "What are you laughing at? Why can't we use dialectics to organize medicine?" Yes, why can't we use "dialectics" to organize medicine?</p>
<p>I think, maybe one day fashion companies will use "dialectics" to cut clothes.</p>
<h3>Seen a Lot</h3>
<p>— Xu Maoyong</p>
<p>On the French translation of Gorky's short story "A Day in Autumn" (Un jour d'automne), below the title, there is a footnote:</p>
<p>"The description of a man who has seen a lot" (Le recit d'un homme qui a beaucoup vu)</p>
<p>In several Chinese translations, this sentence seems to be missing.</p>
<p>The three words "seen a lot" are really the source of Gorky's works and the cause of his greatness.</p>
<p>Moreover, this is not only true for Gorky, but for all great writers.</p>
<p>To see a lot, one must rely on travel, but this is extremely limited. There are only two types of people who can travel freely. One is the rich who have enough money for travel, who can see a lot in upper-class society. The other is the vagabond who has no money for travel, who can see a lot in lower-class society. As for the middle class who have a little money for travel, they are mostly unable to travel quickly and unable to see a lot.</p>
<p>Xiao Bowen and Gorky, who are best known to Chinese people, are ready-made examples of two types of fast travelers.</p>
<p>Chinese writers mostly come from the middle class. Some of them have been abroad and think they have "traveled ten thousand miles," but what they have seen is nothing more than people and things within their own class and limited to those around them. Other aspects, even if they have seen them, are only superficial. Therefore, in our literary world, although there is also bourgeois literature, it is often "drawing a tiger but resembling a dog," only achieving some "romantic sentiments, love, and kissing." In other aspects, our "proletarian literature" is also completely "purely greenhouse literature."</p>
<p>However, we have had a few writers who have seen a lot in the countryside, such as Lu Xun. Therefore, we can still have works such as "Nahan" and "Panghuang."</p>
<p>If our middle-class writers still want to write works and want to make their works have life, then they must see more. Fortunately, there are still great and vast places where you can travel, namely the countryside. Don't always imprison yourself in the pavilion of the metropolis.</p>
<h3>A Day</h3>
<p>— Ai Xia</p>
<p>Early in the morning, I was awakened by my nephew. The first thing that came to my mind while lying in bed was, "What to do today?" I only bought four sesame cakes last night for dinner, and the rice has been gone for a long time… Three days ago, on another night when the rice was almost gone, the remaining rice was only enough to cook porridge, and all the vegetables were finished. I asked my younger nephew, Linger: "There are no vegetables tonight. Is it okay to eat porridge?" He didn't answer, expressing his unwillingness. I, who am used to running out of food, didn't feel anything about it. Years of wandering life have tempered me so that I don't care at all. On the dinner table was a piece of white tofu in soy sauce, six copper coins worth of peanuts, and four bowls of thin porridge. The children were happy to see the peanuts on the table and smiled. "Mom, Linger picked out the big peanuts to eat. He doesn't eat porridge." "Eat quickly, don't make a fuss. We don't know how we'll get through tomorrow." Qing'er complained about her younger brother, but was rebuked by her mother. She lowered her head unhappily to eat porridge, thinking in her heart that her mother was always partial and protective of her younger brother. Everyone was quiet. Linger finished two bowls and wanted more, but my sister stopped him: "Don't eat anymore. You'll have to get up to pee tonight." I, who am naturally afraid to ask people to borrow money, would rather find clothes to pawn, but the clothes that could be pawned had already been sent to the pawnshop long ago. Even my most beloved, favorite cheongsam, had already been sent to the pawnshop two months ago to pay for one month of the rent that was overdue for two months and could no longer be owed. At ten o'clock the next day, I ran to Old Chen's, hoping to get some manuscript fees to help us out of our immediate needs. But when I thought that the manuscript fee he had prepaid last time was almost the same as the manuscript fee I should have received for that novella, I didn't want to ask and had to walk out dejectedly, even though I knew that my family was waiting for rice with the pot lid open. I was mentally agitated. The sun was baking my back, and hot sweat flowed down my forehead, itchy and a little painful. My hands kept wiping the sweat on my face. My whole body was hot, and the asphalt road under my feet seemed to be deliberately dragging my shoes forcefully, making my steps so heavy that it was unusually difficult to move. A car sped past me, stirring up all the dust. "Bastard!" I couldn't help but curse bitterly. I returned home tiredly and saw Qing'er and Linger looking at me with hopeful eyes, which made me very sad. This day was spent by selling sixty-three copper coins worth of glass bottles. The next day, I sold forty-five copper coins worth of newspapers. For two days, we all bought five copper coins worth of sesame paste and one and a half pounds of sliced noodles, mixed them and ate them, and at night we ate flatbread. "Mom, why haven't we had rice for the past two days and only eat one meal of noodles?" "Sigh!" I didn't answer, but replaced it with a long sigh.</p>
<h3>Ordinary Matters (30)</h3>
<p>— Dan Guosun</p>
<p>Zhi Guang heard this and was overjoyed. He ran to Bo Tang, grabbed his right shoulder with his left hand and his right hand with his right hand, and shouted at him in a Hysteria-like manner: "Where did this motivation come from, Bo Tang! I also want to donate my motorcycle to them, which can be of some use!" "Of course!" "How do we notify the people in the factory?" "We can just call them and tell them to come tomorrow morning to discuss the delivery method." After saying this, he ran to make a phone call first. Zhi Guang and Pei Yu also followed behind him, going in and out of the house. Pei Yu also said, "As long as you don't run around, I won't stop you from helping others…" Bo Tang hadn't even reached the phone when the phone suddenly rang incessantly. Bo Tang turned his head to them and said, "At this time, it's almost ten o'clock. It must be Old Master's call…" As he said this, he had already picked up the receiver: "Hello… it's me, Yao Bo Tang… Who is it?… Ah, Brother Wen Qing, long time no see… No, I'm not going out… Very good, very good… I'll be waiting for you at home… Very good, very good, see you in a while." Pei Yu saw him hang up the phone and asked: "Which Wen Qing?" "Ma Wenqing, the chief translator in the French Concession Police… He said he had something important to see me about, which I can't guess what it is… Never mind, let's call the people in the factory first, that's the most important thing." Then he picked up the phone again. This time, it took him a good two minutes to get through to Nanshi and connect to the factory. It took him another good two minutes to find the representative they were looking for. When he came, he said a few simple words that made the other party very satisfied and arranged for them to come over at twelve o'clock tomorrow morning to discuss it. The negotiation of this matter can be considered resolved, and it only remains to be seen how it will be executed. Zhi Guang naturally wanted to leave, but Bo Tang asked him to stay a little longer to hear the news from Wen Qing. Later, he would ask A Ming to drive him back, because Wen Qing and they had all known each other in Paris, and the so-called important matter might be related to the war. So Zhi Guang temporarily lay down on the opium couch in Bo Tang's study. When he woke up, he saw Wen Qing and Bo Tang sitting on a long armchair to the left of the opium couch. They had probably been talking for a while. So Zhi Guang quickly got up and greeted Wen Qing. Soon, Wen Qing continued to talk about the problem they had been talking about: "So, Old Master only came here yesterday!" "Yesterday," Bo Tang said. "The old man hasn't been here today." "Is there any way to find the old man now?" "That's probably not easy. The old man hasn't called today." "Where is the old man's residence?" "Masnan Road."</p>

<h3>The Rise of Finance, Prices, and Stocks, and the Subsiding of the Speculation Craze Yesterday</h3>
<p>—A Midday Drop of Eight Dollars and Four Cents—</p>
<p>After rising for consecutive days, the gold market began to fall back yesterday. At the beginning of the morning, British and American gold and silver prices fell. Although British and American exchange rates shrank by .75, and the American and British exchange rates fell by .04, the forward silver price on the metal exchange only shrank by 0.035, which was already a rebound from the opening. In addition, the American cotton price rose by 0.39 pounds, the American wheat price rose by 0.0725, and the American stock price rose by more than 2 dollars, so people's minds were tired. The opening price fell as soon as it opened, and then it fell with the exchange rate. There were quite a few who bravely went short, but it was still mediocre after the general exchange rate hedging. Soon, HSBC listed a British increase of 1.25, while the US dollar did not move, and the situation was difficult to improve. It was hovering and uncertain. The Zhongfu Bank also had a supply. There was news from the foreign electricity that the American president had asked the people to buy stocks, and there was a slight setback, but there was no special stimulus. The banks' appetite was inclined to accept, so that the market atmosphere was weak, but there was a lot of circling. According to reports, the United States issued banknotes, but the number was small and it was difficult to have an impact. The range of rise and fall in the morning was not large, but there were many rounds. The bare price was increased by 165 yuan. The market conditions in the morning will be recorded now.</p>
<p>The morning opening was 860.8 yuan, a decrease of 5.4 yuan compared to the previous close. The near-term price opened at 1 shilling, 3 pence, and .06 pounds, or 27.875 yuan, a solid 1.25 yuan increase compared to the previous close. Shunli, Hengyu, Wanxing, Yifeng, Yongqing, Fa, Yongda, Decheng, and Zhengchang all sold. When the time came, it was reduced from 1.2 yuan to 56.5 yuan. McGary bought 3.125 US dollars worth of October, and Dongya Shanghai accepted another 0.5 yuan worth of November. Bingxing and Dachangxiang both bought. Although Ruixing sold, but Zhengchang and Hengyu also were and rose back to 62 yuan. Huabi blocked 0.25 US dollars worth of October, Hengtai, Zhaofeng, Chang, Yifeng, Yongzhi, and Fengyong also lost. The silver company blocked 0.375 US dollars worth of October. It was learned that HSBC listed a British increase of 1.25, but the US did not move, and it fell back to 55.8 yuan. Sumitomo ate 0.375 US dollars worth of October and rose. Mitsui blocked 3.125 US dollars worth of October and still fell, hovering between 78 yuan. After entering, Fuyu, Wanxing, Daxing, Yongyuan, and Heng all sold. The bank did 0.375 US dollars for October, and the peers wanted to block it but failed, and it fell to 54 yuan. Shanghai even accepted 4.375 and 3.75 US dollars for October. Zhejiang accepted another 3.75 and 3.125 US dollars for the same month. The Dalian gang then sandwiched the speculation premium, and the situation rose again. Tongtaichang, Hongxing, Qianchangxiang went further. Mitsui pulled 0.5 US dollars for November, and then rose to 61.5 yuan. Hengyu, Yongfeng, goods, and Hengyu sold again, falling to 37 yuan. Sumitomo blocked 3.125 US dollars for October and 0.125 US dollars for September. Shunli bought a little and slightly pulled it up. After entering, Huabi sold 4.375 US dollars for October, and Zhaofeng Chang, Fuchang, and sold and fell to 54.5 yuan. Zhifeng Yong Hongli entered, gradually raising the price. Mitsui still blocked 3.75 US dollars for October, and there was a slight struggle in the middle. After entering, Daxing Yong Zhifeng Yong Shunli went further to 9 yuan. Shanghai Huabi accepted 3.75 US dollars for October, and McGary accepted 0.5 US dollars for November. Fuyu sold it, and Huabi sold 0.125 US dollars of US dollars for September to the silver company, and still fell back to 6.7 yuan. The afternoon close was 857.8 yuan, and the goods were auctioned for 8 yuan. The highest price in the morning was 862 yuan, and the lowest price was 854 yuan, with a difference of 8 yuan. As a result, it fell back 8.4 yuan compared to the previous close.</p>
<p>The quoted price of the exchange rate bank's US exchange rate remained unchanged at 27.5 yuan, and the combined premium price was 872.73 yuan. According to the closing price, it was about 15 yuan, which was 8 yuan more than the previous closing. The registered amount for this month was 863 yuan, and for September it was 858 yuan. The morning supplementary water was 863 yuan, and the surplus bare price was increased by 165 yuan. 150 taels were sold by Yingfeng Heng in the market, and the calculated premium was increased by 170 yuan. The market conditions were slightly stable. 777 August notes remained.</p>
<p>The transaction in the market was mediocre. Exchange rate hedging was on the buying side, and people's minds were not uplifted. Therefore, the situation in the morning was hovering. In total, the Dalian Gang, Shunli, Wanxing, Hengxing, Dachangxiang, Tongtaichang, Hongxing, Hongli, Qianchangxiang, Yuanfengyong, etc., were on the buying side, while Daxing Yong Hengyu Bingxing Ruixing Hengtai Yifeng Yong Yuanheng Yongfeng Fuyu Zhaofeng Chang, etc., were on the selling side. Da Decheng Zhengchang Qingfa Yong came out first and then entered. Bingxing Hengyu advanced first and then came out. The Dalian Gang Wanxing collectively entered more than 1,400 notes, and about 700 notes were entered. Shunli entered more than 700 notes, and only about 400 notes were issued. The transaction of the Guangdong Gang Hengxing was extremely small. In total, there were 16,499 chips in September.</p>
<h3>British and American Exchange Rates Unanimously Eased</h3>
<p>According to yesterday's telegraph, the near and far terms of the London Da Tiao shrank by 0.125, the US bank dropped by 0.25, the British to US shrank by 0.75, the US to British shrank by 0.04, and the forward silver price on the metal exchange fell by 0.035. Compared with the opening, it had already formed a long return. In addition, with the sharp rise in prices and stocks, people's minds returned to fatigue. The opening near-term selling price was calculated at 1 shilling, 3 pence, and .0625 pounds for the British exchange rate, and 27.875 yuan for the American exchange rate, a solid 1.25 increase compared to the previous close. After the opening, the banks all climbed, while the gold industry blocked. HSBC's listed British rose by 1.25, while the US did not move, and the situation hovered and was uncertain. Chinese banks such as Shanghai and Zhejiang all climbed. McGary, Citibank, Central, and Holland were all on the buying side. The Japanese Bank, Sumitomo, accepted while Mitsui blocked. Huabi Silver Company blocked first and then climbed. The process was mediocre. By the afternoon close, the near-term selling price was 1 shilling, 3 pence, and .0625 pounds for the British exchange rate, and 28 yuan for the American exchange rate, with a solid 1.25 increase for the British and a 0.25 easing for the US compared to the previous close.

<h3>Guangjiao Beans Continue to Rise Vigorously</h3>
<p>—Prices Are Pushed Higher and Higher—</p>
<p>In recent days, Guangjiao beans have seen vigorous exports due to sales by the Guangdong merchant guild, and although there is ample spot stock on the market, those with available goods have a manipulative mindset. Therefore, market prices are rising steadily, with a significant increase of six to seven yuan in five weeks. Yesterday, prices were pushed up by another two yuan, exceeding the 80 yuan mark.

<h3>Bullish Sentiment Emerges in Securities and Public Bonds</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange market remained uncertain. Due to ambiguous statements by Mr. Feng, rumors arose in the market, and investor sentiment gradually weakened. Large investors continued to sell, with most being bullish investors exiting the market. Short selling by northern traders remained strong. At the opening in the morning, large bullish investors exited the market, and retail investors sold more than they bought, causing prices to fall across the board. Among them, the current month's 20-roll bonds fell the most, by eight jiao, because they had risen by three and a half jiao the previous day. Relatively, the decline in unified salt tax bonds was smaller. At the close, retail investors continued to sell, with the previously listed demobilization and troop reduction bonds falling slightly by two or three jiao. Starting from the 19-- distant futures, such as numbers 32 and 47, saw buying interest, and the market trended stronger again, rebounding by one or two jiao to three or four jiao. The overall trend, however, remained a mixed and chaotic situation. As a result, market prices continued to decline by two or three jiao to five or six jiao, with demobilization bonds falling the most, by eight jiao.

<h3>"Wet" Stocks in New York Trend Towards Buying</h3>
<p>According to a report from New-Fong Foreign Firm, on Tuesday (the 1st), the New York stock market was sluggish all day. In the last few minutes, however, it was generally believed that the liquidation of "wet" stocks was nearing completion, and people rushed to buy them, causing "wet" stocks to rise by about six yuan. The market situation became increasingly firm, and there is a possibility of further gains tomorrow. The total volume of transactions for the day was 1,780,000 shares. Due to poor crop conditions and a lack of rain and frost, wheat was widely purchased, resulting in a sharp increase of over eight fen. Trading in American cotton was quiet, with a shortage of sellers. Manufacturers bought slightly more, and the market rose by thirty or forty points. The Dow Jones Index is listed below:</p>

<p>Yarn and Cotton</p>
<h3>Mark Yarn and Cotton Advance in the Morning, Decline in the Afternoon</h3>
<p>The yarn market rose in the morning and fell in the afternoon, with the situation remaining weak. This is because there is still no news of a reduction in yarn stocks in warehouses. According to a partial survey, there are still 36,815 bales, most of which are Dragon Boat picking cotton yarn. The sales of this cotton yarn are currently very sluggish. A certain cotton industry organization has a large amount of hedging, but spot yarn sales are still good. In the afternoon, the Sichuan merchant guild sent a telegram to stop loading and handling goods because banditry was rampant in that area, and inferior goods were being dumped, causing the market to decline.</p>
<h3>Yarn Belt Softens in Color</h3>
<p>At the opening of the man-mark market, prices rose by five jiao to one yuan for each month due to the increase in American cotton, prompting short covering. In the afternoon, the Sichuan merchant guild sent a telegram to Shanghai to stop handling goods, causing investor sentiment to suddenly change, and prices fell by four or five jiao for each month. The total trading volume for the day was 28,100 bales. It was found that Suilong sold 1,250 bales, Changfeng sold 1,650 bales, Yuantai sold 1,350 bales, Yuanda sold 750 bales, and Chunji sold 600 bales. Yakang bought 1,000 bales, Tongfu bought 600 bales, Dafeng bought 600 bales, and Gengfeng bought 700 bales. The closing prices are as follows:</p>

<p>Yunnan 400 Shantou 80 Xiamen 30 Ningbo 0 Anqing 17 Fellow Traders 40 Guangdong 320 Northern Traders 25 Fujian 5 Inland 65</p>
<p>The flower market initially rose and then fell. Due to the increase in American cotton, investor sentiment was lifted, and the Ningbo merchant guild made large purchases. However, inland merchants, seeing favorable weather conditions, still tended to short sell when prices rose. Furthermore, the American cotton purchased by the National Government at a slightly lower price was sold to foreign merchants for 4,000 bales, for delivery in Shanghai in August and September. A large batch is expected to arrive in Shanghai later, but some still bullishly view American cotton with a small long position. As for the sellers, they believe that the domestic economy is weak, and the prices of all goods are falling, while cotton prices are still high, so they are watching for a decline.</p>
<h3>Mark Flower Rises Only Slightly</h3>
<p>At the opening of the Zheng mark market, prices rose along with the external market, with each month rising by two and a half to three and a half jiao. In the afternoon, it was heard that the National Government's American cotton would soon arrive in Shanghai in large quantities, causing investor sentiment to weaken again, and the market atmosphere suddenly loosened. Prices fell by one and a half to two jiao for each month. The total trading volume for the day was 84,300 picks. It was found that Xiesheng sold 3,100 dan, Yuanda sold 3,400 dan, Yuantai sold 2,300 dan, Yulian sold 2,200 dan, Hengde sold 3,000 dan, Xincheng sold 2,600 dan, and Ruiyuan sold 2,100 dan.

<h3>First Estimation Report of National Cotton Production in the 22nd Year</h3>
<p>Published by the China Cotton Industry Statistics Association at 5 PM on August 1st</p>
<p>The China Cotton Industry Statistics Association announced the first estimation of national cotton production in the 22nd year at 5 PM on August 1st as follows:</p>
<p>Cotton Field Area 39,157,446</p>
<p>Ginned Cotton Production 10,734,451</p>
<p>The above estimation is based on (1) reports from eleven provinces, including Hebei, Shandong, Shanxi, Henan, Shaanxi, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang, as well as Shanghai and Tianjin; (2) the condition of cotton crops before July 25th; (3) losses from disasters suffered by cotton crops in various provinces before July 25th are included in the calculation; (4) cotton fields are measured in Chinese mu, and cotton production is measured in dan (100 jin per dan). The first estimation of this year is compared with the cotton field area and production of previous years and the three estimations published each year for the past two years as follows:</p>
<p>Cotton Field Area (mu) Ginned Cotton Production (dan)</p>
<p>Year 8 33,037,881 9,028,390 Year 9 28,327,297 6,750,403 Year 10 28,226,168 5,429,220 Year 11 33,460,595 8,510,355 Year 12 29,554,003 7,144,642 Year 13 28,771,577 7,808,880 Year 14 28,121,027 7,534,351 Year 15 27,349,727 6,243,585 Year 16 27,610,176 6,702,108 Year 17 21,926,311 8,839,274 Year 18 33,811,233 7,387,021 Year 19 37,393,012 8,809,567 Year 20 30,468,352 6,793,241 First Estimation</p>

<p>The condition of national cotton production this year is generally good, especially in the northwestern provinces. In northern cotton planting, rainfall during the sowing season is crucial to cotton fields and harvests. This year, there was sufficient rain during the sowing period, leading to an increase in cotton fields. Except for the northeast river area in Hebei, which decreased due to banditry, the rest increased slightly. Shanxi saw the largest increase, and Henan and Shaanxi also saw increases as the political situation was relatively stable, and grain prices were low. Timely rainfall in early summer also contributed to the increase in cotton fields. In Hubei, after the great flood in the 20th year, followed by banditry, cotton fields were greatly reduced. This year, banditry along the Yangtze River was suppressed, and not only were most of the old cotton fields restored, but also the new cotton fields increased significantly due to low grain prices and high cotton prices. Jiangsu Province also saw progress in cotton fields, due to the relationship between cotton and grain prices, and the slight drought in Tongru at the end of spring also contributed to the increase in cotton fields. Only Shandong Province saw a slight decrease. The total area of cotton fields in the eleven provinces is 39,157,446 mu, the highest in the recent decade, an increase of 2,057,646 mu compared to the 21st year. The condition of cotton production is good in most areas, except for a very few regions, especially in the north. Except for Shandong, which decreased slightly due to the Cao district, the rest are more abundant than last year. Shanxi, Henan, and Shaanxi received rain at the time of sowing, and the weather was also favorable after germination, so the growth was very lush. The quality of cotton production in Shaanxi is the best in recent years. Many estimate that each mu can yield 200 jin of seed cotton. Cotton fields in Henan are similar to last year, but the harvest has increased several times. The soil and climate in the northwest are suitable for cotton planting, but they are prone to drought. This year, there was sufficient rainfall, so the growth is naturally good. The weather was very good in Hubei during sowing, but along the Yangtze River, it was difficult to drain water due to the flooding river, and there were some flooded areas, but the rest were good. The situation in Hunan is similar. The season for cotton planting in Jiangsu was also favorable, but there was slightly more rain later, and recently it has been too dry. Zhejiang is also quite similar. Overall, the national cotton production is expected to be abundant. The estimated production of ginned cotton in the eleven provinces is 10,734,451 dan, an increase of 2,628,814 dan compared to the actual harvest in the 21st year, and equal to the first estimation on August 20th in the 21st year. According to the current situation, the cotton-producing areas in the north and south are slightly suffering from drought, especially in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Henan, and Shaanxi, so the estimation has been slightly reduced. If a suitable amount of rainfall can be obtained, the harvest will improve further. According to this estimation, the national average yield of ginned cotton per mu is 27.2 jin, second only to 27.7 jin in the 17th year in the recent decade. It was 21.8 jin in the 21st year, 5.4 jin more this year. The first estimations of cotton field area and ginned cotton production in each province in the 22nd year are listed below:</p>
<p>Cotton Field Area Ginned Cotton Production</p>
<p>Hebei 5,872,170 1,476,007 Shandong 5,472,220 1,537,826 Shanxi 1,532,594 519,607 Henan 3,126,770 984,950 Shaanxi 1,702,173 606,457 Hubei 8,310,240 2,329,400 Hunan 819,239 212,937 Jiangxi 202,400 62,526 Anhui 1,079,382 199,227 Jiangsu 9,682,922 2,290,759 Zhejiang 1,556,335 515,055 Total 39,157,446 10,734,451.</p>
<h3>American Cotton Consumption Not Weak</h3>
<p>—Rise of Thirty or Forty Points—</p>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton saw vigorous purchases due to the approach of New Year's Day and large consumption. The market was firm and active, resulting in a spot price increase of forty points and a futures price increase of thirty to thirty-nine points. The Liverpool cotton market saw a spot price decrease of ten points and a futures price increase of up to ninety points. Egyptian cotton fell by ten points, and the Bombay cotton market was closed.

<h3>Flour and Foreign Wheat Diverge</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market was quoted based on foreign wheat prices, with Chicago rebounding by 1.65 yuan and Canada rising by about 2.89 yuan. Therefore, investor sentiment was initially stable when the opening prices were announced. However, in subsequent trading sessions, large and small factories were offering sales, totaling around 100,000 bags. Moreover, due to the expected abundance of early-maturing and autumn harvests of rice in various places, market prices gradually softened. As a result, speculative sentiment inevitably became active. Therefore, although foreign wheat prices rose, the market situation was flat and weak. The future trend will depend on actual sales. As a result, the current month was lower by two and a half li, each month was good by five li, October was good by three and a half li, November was lower by two and a half li, and there were no other changes.</p>
<h3>Foreign Wheat Promotes Rebound in Wheat Futures</h3>
<p>—Wheat Factories and Distributors Hold Back and Move Little—</p>
<p>After the opening of the wheat futures market yesterday morning, prices rebounded for each month. Foreign wheat prices were quoted, with Chicago rising by 1.65 yuan and Canada rising by 2.89 yuan. Furthermore, the market was dominated by traders with bullish positions, with a substantial amount. Inland wheat prices also held steady. There were few sellers on the market, so investor sentiment held high hopes. However, considering the weakening rice prices and the impending import of borrowed wheat, although the market has been stabilized, it may be difficult to avoid the disaster of being eroded in the future. As a result, the current month was better by four fen compared to the previous day, September rose by six fen, October was better by four fen, and November was better by six fen. The spot wheat market remained stable, with most wheat factories and distributors holding back and moving little. The opening price for Bengbu wheat was 3.86 yuan, Suqian wheat was 3.81 yuan, second-grade was 3.75 yuan, Yaowan wheat was 3.77 yuan, Qingjiang wheat was 3.71 yuan, second-grade was 3.66 yuan, Gaoyou wheat was 3.63 yuan, second-grade was 3.57 yuan, Jiangbei wheat was 3.57 yuan, and Wusong wheat was 3.45 yuan. Fuxin handled 5,000 bags, and Xinda handled 2,000 bags.</p>
<h3>Yaowan New Mung Beans Launched Yesterday</h3>
<p>Yaowan new raw mung beans were launched yesterday, totaling 115 bags. This year's product is of higher quality than in previous years, but sales are slow, so it is difficult to get a good price. Yesterday, the Wenzhou merchant guild purchased them at a price of 4.68 yuan.</p>
<p>Silk and Tea</p>
<h3>Shandong New Yellow Silk Samples Available</h3>
<p>Hangzhou Autumn Silkworms Will Be Hibernating In Hangzhou's counties and townships, silkworm farmers, who found it difficult to profit from the spring and summer cocoon harvests, are raising autumn silkworms. The weather has been good after hatching, and the silkworms are growing well. The early-batch silkworms in Linping and other places will be hibernating soon, and the later-batch silkworms in the upper four townships are also turning green.</p>
<p>Shandong New Yellow Silk Arrives in Shanghai This year's cocoon production in Laisu, Shandong is still good. The new yellow silk has been packed into thirty-two boxes and arrived in Shanghai yesterday. The color is better than last year. It is currently being distributed to various printing shops for sampling.</p>
<p>Artificial Silk Sales Clear, Prices Rise Recently, the foreign exchange rate has been shrinking frequently, and the price of artificial silk has been increasing. Customer sales are sparse. Yesterday, only the Jiangsu and Zhejiang merchant guilds imported current and futures goods from carbon rock and other brands such as Miss Knight and Flying Horse, totaling thirteen boxes. The price ranged from 175.25 yuan to 160.75 yuan. Net clearance.</p>
<h3>Needle Eyebrow and Gongxi Tea Transactions Still Strong</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the incoming needle eyebrow and Gongxi green teas from various tea estates saw brisk sales to English and Indian traders. Goods were sold as soon as they arrived. The top price for needle eyebrow was 107 yuan, and the top price for Gongxi was 90 yuan, unchanged from the past few days. There was high demand for Pingshui pearl tea from French traders, and the selling price was firm. However, Zhenmei tea remained quiet, and the ordinary market price continued to show a downward trend. The remaining stock of Qining black tea is only several thousand boxes, and judging from the current situation, it should be cleared within the year.</p>
<p>Dried Goods</p>
<h3>Daylily and Pickled Mustard Sales Both Smooth</h3>
<p>The sales of new golden needle vegetables have been smooth recently, and the number of offers is tight. The higher prices have reached 18 yuan.

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>Two "Five Hundred Thousand"</h3>
<p>—Xiao Zhi</p>
<p>Opening the newspaper, I successively discovered two headline news items with the large title of "Five Hundred Thousand" in the "Local News" and "National News" sections. Yes, "Five Hundred Thousand (500,000)" must be a lengthy, huge, noteworthy, and amazing number!!</p>
<p>This number, one originated in our China, and of course it is the first prize of the "Aviation Lottery," the "only opportunity to get rich," which is "Five Hundred Thousand" silver dollars! And the other originated in the United States, across the Pacific Ocean from us, which is "Five Hundred Thousand" unemployed people having jobs after President Roosevelt's "Recovery Plan" was implemented. We have talked about our "getting rich" matter many times, so I won't talk about it anymore! Now, I will only briefly copy some of the news from the United States to compare with "ours":</p>
<p>(New York) After surveying the situation across the United States, after the implementation of the National Industrial Recovery Act next Monday, at least 500,000 unemployed people will be able to get jobs on Monday morning (Note by Xiao Zhi: coinciding with the day the winning numbers for our "get rich ticket" are announced), with the lowest wages averaging fourteen yuan per week... Working hours will be reduced to thirty-five hours per week..."</p>
<p>Here, we can find two huge differences: "We" are dealing with silver dollars, while they are dealing with bread; only one lucky person will hold "Five Hundred Thousand" silver dollars and grin from ear to ear, while "Five Hundred Thousand" people will no longer have their stomachs rumbling like drums, and they will replace their frowning faces with joyful smiles! However, the fact that everyone cannot gloss over or escape is that before this "Monday": "We" have nearly 500,000 people (note: the total number of "lottery tickets" issued this time is 500,000) dreaming and praying day and night to win the "Five Hundred Thousand" first prize, because nearly five hundred thousand people have not become rich and do not have a comfortable life: in the United States, more than five hundred thousand people do not have jobs and do not have bread to eat. These are ironclad facts! And due to these facts, we can see that this society has reached an extreme point of recession and has a great tendency and necessity to turn around! Therefore, no matter how they give "Five Hundred Thousand" silver dollars to one person to "get rich" and enjoy comfort, it cannot be concealed that in another corner of this world, or even in the same place, there are tens of hundreds of "Five Hundred Thousand" unemployed people who have no work and no food to eat. Some of them have lost consciousness and are groaning, but the sound of this groan has shaken the world somewhat! Some of them are roaring and even going crazy! Because in fact, they are starving too much!</p>
<p>Ah, "Five Hundred Thousand," two [Five Hundred Thousand] (500,000)! What a lengthy, huge, noteworthy, amazingly comical number!</p>

<h3>The Wonderful Use of Dictionaries</h3>
<p>—Guo Rong</p>
<p>The function of English dictionaries seems to have been fully and completely publicized in the advertisements of several bookstores that publish various dictionaries, from writing and problem-solving to giving gifts to relatives and friends, all are suitable; and the people who use them, holding dictionaries from translating the orders of the big bosses to piecing together the unfamiliar words in foreign love letters, all use them in their own wonderful ways. However, yesterday, while reading the newspaper</p>
<h3>"Three Monks Have No Water to Drink"</h3>
<p>, but it still allowed me to discover a grander and more miraculous application. This application was discovered in a certain newspaper on July 29th.</p>
<h3>"Interview with Teacher Xiao" · Oh · What a Big Question</h3>
<p>Initially, I thought it was an interview with the humor master George Bernard Shaw, but upon closer inspection, it turned out to be Teacher Xiao of the national goods movement. Indeed, I was confused: this year is the year of national goods, so this Teacher Xiao is naturally also the Teacher Xiao of national goods. Teacher Xiao is the host of the spirit writing activities at the Shanghai Religious Research Society. This altar does not use planchette writing. Instead, a square of yellow cloth is placed, along with over a thousand futons. The leaders of the five religions of Confucianism, Buddhism, Taoism, Christianity, and Islam all descend. Those who seek guidance sit on the futon, clear their minds, and observe the screen, where various divine lights appear. A reporter from the Jingbao newspaper went for "sightseeing" and, after looking left and right, saw several Roman numerals. It is said that this was a Christian hint because the reporter had been baptized.</p>
<p>Listen closely, the wonderful writing is coming: "Xiao Yun, ten years ago, saw some Roman letters in the divine light, but did not understand them. So, he bought an English dictionary and burned it in front of the altar. The next day, Jesus descended upon the altar, the divine light shone, and an English article appeared on the screen. He ordered a skilled stenographer to record it and translate it into Chinese, which turned out to be nothing more than words of encouragement." Okay, okay, marvelous writing, marvelous event, I respectfully stop copying here.</p>
<p>Alas, the uses of a dictionary are many, but the ability to summon the savior Jesus has not been heard of. However, I have no trace of immortal bones or aura in my life, so the fact that a dictionary can summon Jesus to descend has puzzled me for a whole day and night. That Jesus would come to a Chinese spirit writing altar is in itself enough to be called the greatest religious discovery in the 1,933 years since Jesus's birth. And that a dictionary could have the same efficacy as the magical charms of Chenzhou in commanding gods and dispatching ghosts is an even greater miracle. Oh, I'm oh-ing. Jesus was Jewish and didn't understand English at all, let alone the modern English found in today's dictionaries. And the skilled stenographer around Teacher Xiao also doesn't understand Hebrew. So, after buying and burning an English dictionary (I wonder if it was Webster's Unabridged Dictionary), Jesus got the dictionary and translated Hebrew into English overnight to prepare for the next day's descent. Or perhaps Teacher Xiao thought that the wealthy Jewish businessman Hardoon in Shanghai had become a British citizen, so he inferred that Jesus had also become a British citizen? That's why he didn't buy a French dictionary, a German dictionary, or a Russian dictionary, but bought an English dictionary. If an English dictionary can summon Jesus, then perhaps Wang Yunwu's Great Dictionary can summon Confucius! While the Commercial Press is offering special pre-order prices for various dictionaries, I advise everyone to buy a few more, so that the leaders of the five major religions can be summoned at any time.</p>
<p>Finally, there is one thing I want to ask Teacher Xiao: Why does the Christian teaching use Roman numerals in the "divine light"? Since Jesus is not a Henley &amp; Son clockmaker, why did he only fixate on the Roman numerals on the clock face? Perhaps Teacher Xiao thinks that Roman numerals are the language of the Romans in the Roman era; but he doesn't know that the Romans at that time used Latin!</p>
<p>In this day and age, even stranger tricks are not surprising. However, today many people are calling and writing letters to inquire about the whereabouts of Teacher Xiao's presence, which shows that quite a few people have been attracted by Teacher Xiao. On the surface, this is just a funny little play not worth the smile of an expert; however, after carefully considering the shallowness and ignorance of the Chinese upper and middle classes displayed in this event, I can only laugh bitterly like watching a play by George Bernard Shaw that satirizes life!</p>

<h3>Ramblings While Ill</h3>
<p>— Bing</p>
<p>I was originally a staunch believer in science and Western medicine, and I was somewhat skeptical of the mystical and metaphysical aspects of Western medicine. However, after several visits from the demon of illness, I developed the opposite belief. I no longer absolutely trust Western medicine, and I feel that Traditional Chinese Medicine really needs to be developed and promoted.</p>
<p>Because my illness was not light, I carefully went to a famous XX hospital for diagnosis and treatment. I sat in the vast waiting room for a full two hours before my number, fifty-eight, was called. I climbed two flights of escalators and paid my respects to the doctor, (Doctors really should be called lords.)</p>
<p>"What's your problem?" he asked, his eyes fixed elsewhere. "I have some pain in my neck!" I pointed to the painful area on my right neck with my index finger.</p>
<p>"How many days?"</p>
<p>"Two days!"</p>
<p>"It's lymphadenitis! Go to the inner room for bandaging. I'll also give you some laxatives. If it doesn't work, come back in a few days for surgery!" He had already taken the examination card of another patient. My eyes widened, with a pleading light, and my lips trembled as I wanted to ask him to examine me carefully, because I not only had pain in my neck, but also other more important problems. But he gave me an impatient glance, and I had no choice but to move into the inner room.</p>
<p>I was reminded of two past incidents.</p>
<p>Last April, I was terribly deceived. It was clearly diphtheria, clearly not a disease without a cure, but the doctor with a PhD from XX hospital misdiagnosed my survival. A dollar for registration, only to earn these two golden words: "You have scarlet fever, we don't accept it here, hurry to the Public Concession Hospital!" So, I was at a loss. I pondered everything after death, because after being diagnosed by a doctor from such a famous hospital, and since it was incurable scarlet fever, I could only wait to die. But the friend who escorted me pretended to be confident and finally sent me to the Public Concession Hospital. In the end, I was still rescued from diphtheria and now have my life. That famous hospital, that doctor with a PhD, to this day, perhaps forever, I will never forget.</p>
<p>Secondly, a friend of mine had a carbuncle. When this disease is diagnosed by a Western doctor, surgery is undoubtedly required, which gave me a deep understanding. After the surgery, the disease became more severe. Upon seeing the doctor again, he said that another surgery was needed, with the reason being: "During the previous surgery, some toxins were dispersed, so they have now concentrated again." After five surgeries, my friend finally recovered his health from continuous groaning, thanks to the doctor's brilliance. He only slept in bed for two months and spent a lot of silver dollars, not to mention silk checks.</p>
<p>This time, I was going to have surgery again, which made me tremble with great doubt: Is my disease really lymphadenitis? Is surgery the only diagnosis? For a week, the pain in my neck gradually subsided, but my whole body was still immersed in languor, dizziness, and lack of appetite. This clearly proves that my disease has been misdiagnosed again. When you ask for a cleansing medicine to be prescribed, the doctor replies: "Now that the toxins in your neck have been dispersed, the other problems will get better in a few days."</p>
<p>I think the reason why Western medicine is not popular is that most doctors are terrible. Apart from trying their best to please important people and celebrities with a runny nose or a minor injury, they are extremely careless when treating the illnesses of ordinary patients, and the lives of patients can be ended at any time. If it is a Chinese medicine practitioner, the questioning, pulse taking, medical records, and prescriptions are all taken seriously. And the clarity of the various aspects of medication seems to be more reliable and superior than Western medicine, where they give you a cup of water to rinse your mouth when you bleed from your gums.</p>
<p>However, past Chinese medicine practitioners lacked scientific spirit. I hope that those who are engaged in promoting and developing Traditional Chinese medicine will pay attention to this point and work hard to move forward.</p>

<h3>Under the Traffic Light (43)</h3>
<p>— Xilin</p>
<p>"Rich people also hate the Japanese; wasn't the closure of the XX yarn factory caused by the Japanese taking away the business?" This man seized on this simple reason to refute, and the words that the other man wanted to say seemed to be stuck in his throat, so he had to remain silent. So, they all looked at the crowd over there, preparing to see the outcome of the matter. This led Shi Qiao to walk into the crowd.</p>
<p>In the crowd, a police officer was holding a person, and that person had long hair.</p>
<p>Shi Qiao carefully recognized that it was indeed the servant from Yang Jiefu's house.</p>
<p>The police officer held a handful of printed materials in one hand and pointed at Changfa's nose with an index finger. He said: "Lie, lie, are you still lying! What are these? What are these if not leaflets? The front line is fighting fiercely, but you are causing trouble in the rear. Does the XX Party want the country? What good is it to lose the country?"</p>
<p>"The ones who want the country are us poor people! I have not joined the XX Party even if I die. When I get to the police station, everyone will naturally understand." It turned out that Changfa used to be a lackey of Yang Jiefu and had very close dealings with the police station in order to arrest radical elements in the factory. Now that he had fallen out with Yang Jiefu, he was unwilling to explain his true position in the past. Unexpectedly, Li Shiqiao squeezed out of the crowd and stood up to vouch for him, saying:</p>
<p>"You've made a mistake. He is from Yang Jiefu's house. I am a relative of Mr. Yang, so I often see him. He is called Changfa, I guarantee it."</p>
<p>The police officer naturally knew Yang Jiefu's name very well. He only felt that this Li Shiqiao looked like a young student, and how could it be a coincidence that he was also in this refugee shelter? For a moment, he couldn't make a decision and could only stare blankly. Li Shiqiao understood the meaning of that look and took out his business card from his pocket, on which was engraved the title of Standing Committee Member of the XXXX Association, and said:</p>
<p>"I am here on behalf of the Federation to express my condolences to the refugee compatriots. This person must not be a member of the XX Party, or someone is falsely accusing him."</p>
<p>Sure enough, it worked, and the police officer nodded quickly and said:</p>
<p>"Ah, yes, yes, Mr. Li, please tell him to be more careful in the future."</p>
<p>So, the crowd dispersed, and the children scurried among the adults' legs.</p>
<p>"…In the end, this guy has some good points," one person said.</p>
<p>"However, defeating the Japanese is always the most important thing," another person replied with emotion.</p>
<p>Over here, Li Shiqiao led Changfa out.</p>
<p>"Thank you, Mr. Li. But… please don't tell Mr. Yang about this. How did Mr. Li come here too? Is he also here to distribute…" It turned out that Changfa had long suspected that Shi Qiao was the same as him when he was in Yang Jiefu's house. In fact, Changfa was just temporarily hired by the XX Party to do this work.</p>

<h3>A New Romance Added to the Movie Set</h3>
<p>— Si Min</p>
<p>Bright Moon Troupe, Starlight Dimly Visible</p>
<p>Fragrant Quilt, Exquisite News Confusing</p>
<p>These days, the two main actors in "Fragrant Quilt with Bright Moon" being performed at the Grand Cathay Theatre, one is Ramon Novarro, and the other is Myrna Loy.</p>
<p>It is now said that they have secretly married. Or perhaps they have not yet married, but are only secretly engaged. When someone asked Myrna about this, Myrna hesitated and denied it shyly. Of course, she denied it as much as she did, but when women suddenly become shy, especially female stars who are used to acting, can one say that nothing has happened? Moreover, many female stars have secretly married people in the past; when people asked, they still insisted on denying it. But when their hearts were swaying, their faces had already revealed the secret. Before you could say anything, people already knew. Later, the truth was discovered, and it was not far off from the guess. Perhaps the matter between Ramon Novarro and Myrna Loy this time is the same.</p>
<p>If that's the case, why is Myrna Loy keeping it a secret? Or perhaps it's Ramon Novarro's intention. He is currently traveling in Europe and cannot be questioned. But even if he were in Hollywood, reporters would definitely not be able to find out any news. Ramon Novarro has never talked about love with people. Perhaps the secrecy of their marriage is Myrna's intention, because she has always been extremely secretive about her personal affairs. She has been in Hollywood for many years, and no one has ever said that she has had a romance with anyone. And she said before that when she got married, she would not want any publicity. Perhaps this is where she is putting her ideas into practice.</p>
<p>Myrna Loy's temperament in life is very solitary. Although many male stars have expressed enthusiasm for her, she has never shown acceptance. She rarely goes to public places such as dance halls. Some people say that she has been in Hollywood for eleven years, but she has only been to public entertainment venues about thirty times, and none of her male companions has accompanied her several times.</p>
<p>Why is her temperament so strange? It is said that she has also been through romantic setbacks. She once loved a married man. Although Myrna looks very passionate and romantic on the screen, she is not someone who seduces men to destroy other people's families. So, she painfully left him and swore not to mention it, so that few people outside know about this anecdote.</p>
<p>Myrna and Ramon Novarro's love story does not have a very long history. It can be said that the progress of their love is almost entirely based on the film "Fragrant Quilt with Bright Moon." On the first day of filming "Fragrant Quilt with Bright Moon," someone introduced them to each other. After the introduction, Myrna returned to her dressing room to read the script: this is her usual routine. When she acts with someone, she always goes back to the dressing room after acting, and rarely lingers on the set. But this time she co-starred with Ramon in "Fragrant Quilt with Bright Moon," she gradually changed her attitude; she gradually stayed on the set after filming and sat next to Ramon talking. Their attitudes were very close; their tones were very gentle. They gradually went from dining together in the company's dining hall to eating tens of miles away from the set. And they chose quiet corners where the two of them ate and talked. Later, they also ate dinner together. And after they finished dinner, they went to see stage plays together. They discovered their shared love for music. Ramon's singing is admired by everyone, or perhaps the final scene of love was when Ramon used his love song to hit the deepest part of Myrna's heart.</p>
<p>But Ramon had already signed a contract with Europe before he met Myrna. He went to Europe not long ago. This is a helpless thing. But the house that Ramon Novarro built in the mountains is now where Myrna lives. Although it is said that Myrna rented it from Ramon, Ramon probably will not wait for Myrna's rent. Myrna often opens the window, sits on the window sill, and looks out into the wind, presumably not without feeling the sense of missing her lover.</p>
<p>Film Review</p>
<h3>Review of "A Little Sideslip"</h3>
<p>— Yi Wen</p>
<p>A LITTLE SIDESLIP｜Cathay</p>
<p>This is one of Wu Fa's recent films. It belongs to the type of film that focuses on romance and pleasure. Wu Fa's recent film production policy. I think readers have seen it many times, so I don't need to describe it further.</p>
<p>The whole film is full of gags, and there is often light laughter in the air. Of course, the audience is showing a satisfied expression.</p>
<p>In this film, we can know some of the atmosphere of the German upper class. A very happy family naturally wants to pursue spiritual satisfaction, and will naturally reveal more delicate emotions: but satisfaction has no end, so often because of slight accidents, huge misunderstandings are created. Cracks suddenly appear in the couple's feelings｜this film is based on this kind of theme.</p>
<p>In terms of the director's technique, there is not much that can give us some reference｜in my impression, I feel that he has some wonderful things in the connection between scenes. He sometimes uses sound effects to connect, such as the singing sound here, connecting to the singing sound on the other side in the same mood. Although the format has changed, it can still make you feel that this film has Rhythm. Unlike our country's sound films, there is a fade in and fade out between scenes. It makes the audience feel a sense of interruption. Besides, I don't know.</p>
<p>In terms of actors, the configuration is really appropriate. I don't understand German, and in addition to the simple English subtitles, I can feel funny from time to time, which is naturally Ms. Xu Lai's recent photo｜Her debut film [Remnant Spring] is now being completed and will be released soon.</p>
<p>The impression given to me by the actors' actions. I can't help but say that they are faithful to this play.</p>
<p>After the performance. I squeezed in among the gentlemen and ladies, and felt very gentlemanly myself. Returning, I wrote it down.</p>
<h3>Review of "Night World" Night Woild</h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>After watching Hobart Henley's [Night World]</p>
<p>It reminds us of Du Yu's "Innocence". They both use the dark side of society as the theme, and both string together a love story in the shadows of lavish extravagance.</p>
<p>Dance halls, nightlife, women, wine, make people drunk and resentful. [Night World] wants to fully expose these ugliness, and undoubtedly director Hobart Henley is holding a strong resentment. Originally, if we do not deny that these ugliness are all the morbid state of the current society, then the artist's resentment caused by it is naturally also their duty. Although only hating or cursing is not the final solution to these realities, it cannot be said that it is not a more meaningful thing to expose these deceptions without reservation.</p>
<p>In terms of the theme of "Night World", it is very clear that the author is dealing with everything on the basis of economic foundation. Nightclubs, singing and dancing, drinking, the revelry of gentlemen and ladies, thighs, the trembling of flesh, love, adultery, jealousy, infighting, murder, villains, thieves, these, these, of course, are not "virtues" but the so-called "decline of morality". So, here the author very truthfully tells us that they are all for money, so we can easily know that the reason why the current society has such a status quo is the irrationality of this economic institution.</p>
<p>The director explained these and also grasped these. This does not need to be exemplified, anyway, the whole thing is progressing under this explanation. He emphasized the entire outline in the front, and then explained the details of the story's backbone. The beauty of the lens angle proves his skillful technique. In any case, the form and content are completed perfectly. However, strictly speaking, the performance is not very good-looking, nor is it as exaggerated as in ordinary films. On the contrary, although it did not make this work more valuable and become perfect, it is undeniable that their actors were still able to do their best.</p>
<p>However, the love between the teenager whose father died at the hands of his mother and the dancer was not necessary after all, although that teenager was very powerful in the play. Especially when they kissed before being killed by the bandits, the expression of happily dying was really ridiculous. This is the powerlessness of the actors and also the negligence of the director. Finally, I don't want to compare this "Night World" with "Innocence", although there are many differences between the two in terms of content and form.</p>
<p>As an aside, perhaps this is an old film, but because this is a rare work in Universalpicture, I have briefly reviewed it as above.</p>
<h3>People from Jiangxi Sawing Bowls—Minding Only Themselves</h3>
<p>Fu Xi</p>
<p>Although Liliane Haid is not Chinese, she is like our people from Jiangxi—it is said that people from Jiangxi are all sawing bowls—no, people who saw bowls are all from Jiangxi (I'm afraid that's not true, but I haven't done any field research) who only know how to "mind only themselves." It's only fun to watch Liliane watch a play in the theater. She watched two hours of the play, but her eyes were on the stage for less than fifteen minutes. For the rest of the time, she always opened her travel beauty salon, looked at herself in the mirror. She suddenly tidied her hair, suddenly rubbed some powder, and suddenly smeared some rouge, busy and happy. She always watches plays like this. The actors on the stage were extremely angry. One day, before the curtain call, they all took a makeup box and did their hair, rubbed rouge, and smeared powder on the stage, wanting to show Liliane Haid their power, telling her not to be like people from Jiangxi sawing bowls—minding only themselves. Or their hard work is in vain, because Liliane didn't even lift her head at that time.</p>
<h3>Tianyi's Representative Work of the Year</h3>
<p>— Wusheng (Martial Arts Actor)</p>
<p>We are already familiar with the Tianyi Film Company's 1932 representative work, "Traces of Orchid Valley." The company's recently completed "Struggle" has been officially declared as its representative work for 1933. This film possesses sound consciousness, and its directing and acting techniques have reached perfection. A simple introduction to the plot is provided below: Feng Dazhao and his son, Genfa, are farmers. Genfa is in love with Xu Xiaolan, a girl from the same village. Xiaolan lost her parents early and lives with her uncle, Xu Rong. Dazhao is beaten by the landlord, Geng Dao, due to rent arrears, and Genfa is also beaten by the landlord's henchmen for arguing with them. Xiaolan arrives at this moment, and Dadao sees her, marveling at her beauty and wanting to take her as a concubine. Xu Rong, a man driven by profit, readily agrees. That evening, Dazhao dies of grief, and Genfa buries his father with tears, in inconsolable grief. Xiaolan learns of her uncle's plan and rushes to tell Genfa, and they flee together to Shanghai. Time passes quickly, and Genfa and Xiaolan have been living together for two years and have a son. Dadao comes to Shanghai and happens to encounter Genfa and Xiaolan. He finds out their residence and incites Xu Rong to accuse Genfa of abduction. As a result, Genfa is sentenced to imprisonment, and Xiaolan is taken back by Xu Rong. Their son is cared for by an orphanage. Once Xu Rong has Xiaolan, he gives her to Dadao as a concubine. Xiaolan plots to kill Dadao. She feigns happiness, urging Dadao to drink. When he is drunk, she grabs a knife and stabs him, but misses, and the knife is taken away by Dadao. After much struggle, Xiaolan dies under the knife. Genfa is released from prison after serving his term, his family is ruined, and he has nowhere to go. At this time, national crisis is brewing, so he joins the army. One day, Genfa sees the enemy attacking refugees and shoots the enemy dead. Unexpectedly, the person he saved is his enemy, Dadao. Genfa wants to shoot him, but suddenly has a change of heart. He realizes that a gun for killing enemies should not be used to avenge personal grudges, and so he relinquishes it. Later, Genfa eventually dies on the battlefield.</p>
<h3>Soviet Russia's Great Film Factory</h3>
<p>— Rujun</p>
<p>According to the recent Moscow Weekly, the Soviet Union, due to the increasing use of film for educational purposes, has decided to establish a factory to manufacture film. A large-scale film factory is currently being built in Kazan. It is projected to produce 150 million meters of film annually, which is approximately one-sixth of the world's total output. The manufacturing design is quite meticulous, ensuring that the produced film will be free from any dust or small spots, as these small spots are particularly unsightly when magnified on the silver screen. Every morning, workers must shower before entering the factory and change into silk outerwear. The factory is surrounded by gardens. The nearby streets, alleys, and open spaces are all paved with asphalt. The factory floor is waxed, and the walls are painted. All designs adopt the latest styles to avoid dust mixing with the air inside the factory.</p>
<h3>Film Novel "Peg O' My Heart" (4)</h3>
<p>— Guzhang (Lone Palm)</p>
<p>Isolde, upon hearing the signal, jumped up, thinking that Creighton was waiting for her in the garden, or that he had already divorced his wife. Isolde was in disarray, not daring to look him directly in the eye, and asked him to wait until tomorrow to declare their marriage. At that moment, the low signal sounded again in the garden. Derid invited her to take a walk in the garden. Isolde became even more flustered, saying that she would not go today, but would wait until tomorrow. She gave him a kiss and ran upstairs.</p>
<p>Derid stood watching Isolde run up the grand staircase like a goddess, disappearing around a bend. He picked up his hat to leave, but turned around and saw Pang, radiant, standing at the door, and stopped. He haltingly approached Pang. When she saw him, her eyes shot out triumphant gleams. She secretly rejoiced that the signal she had fabricated had unexpectedly worked. Now Isolde had been scared away by her jeers, and he was face to face with her.</p>
<p>Derid took her hand and praised her immensely. Pang said that he, her father, and her white dog were her only confidants in this life. He felt that she was even more charming in her new clothes. She would surely captivate many men, just as he had been captivated by Isolde. Pang said that since he had brought her here, her aunt had taught her to speak, Isolde had taught her to read and walk, and Alaric—she smiled at this point and didn't continue. Derid asked her what Alaric was like. Pang said that Alaric was a very good boy and hoped to take him to see her father. Alaric had also taught her to ride a horse. Derid smiled and picked up his hat to leave. Pang immediately changed her expression and asked him if he was going home now. She wanted to walk with him. She walked with him to the corridor and said softly that the beautiful moonlight had captured her heart. She also asked him softly if he had ever been in love with a woman. She heard him say that he was currently in love with a girl, and her heart suddenly jumped.</p>
<p>She added that she had heard people say that Englishmen often did not immediately declare their love when they fell in love with a woman. In Ireland, it was different. As soon as a young man was interested in a girl, he would immediately tell her the truth. Derid said that he had already said a lot, but asked her not to tell anyone. Pang said that she would definitely hide his words in the depths of her heart. He reached out and took her hand, and she said disappointedly, "Goodbye." (To be continued)</p>
