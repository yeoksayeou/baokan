<h3>時評　晋省人民義務服役都</h3>
<p>晋省當局最近制定人民義務服役章程。通令各縣遵照實行。吾人取而覽之。竊有不能已於言者。敢貢愚見。用備採擇。</p>
<p>第一。吾人欲問晋當局制定此項章程。其動機果何在乎。就章程開宗明義所標示。謂在增進社會榮發展公共事業也。此兩問題胥入建設範圍。當局以全力求其推進。固屬無可非議之事。然建設事業之推進。是否必待於人民之義務服役。則猶爲甚大之疑問。論職掌有專司其事之官廳。言欵項有特予規定之經費。賦工有現成之匠人。恊助多失業之游民。奚事必欲迫全省之人民。弛固有之職業。操生澀之工事。爲義務之服役哉。且以素乏經騐之市民。驅令築路與造林。於何收發展之效能乎。懔於當前之敎條。或將結羣而思遷。於何圖社會之繁榮乎。</p>
<p>第二。章程中規定服役人民。限於十八歲以上四十九歲以下之男子。惟現役軍人與公務員得與敎員學生同在除外之列。此外不問其爲職業勞働。爲游離分子。殆皆網羅無遺。服役期限。每年雖祇有十三日。然在有職業之人民亦且儘感無法應付之苦。在此十三日中。對於原有職務。將聽其停頓乎。抑别謀補救乎。服役期中自備膳食。在中級以上之人民。原屬不妨。其有藉一日之勞動。謀全家之糊口者。連續十三日使無工資。將感妻孥槁餓之不足。已復枵腹以從公。情所難堪。理無可通。當局亦曾計及於此乎。至公務人員。原應爲厲行之表率。兵工築路。久已著他省之成績。今皆使之除外。尤將何以服全省人民之心乎。</p>
<p>上述兩兩點。猶只言其窒碍難行。若就背面立論。則流弊所曁。貽害更烈。如地方工作之分配。疾病免役之證明。在在使吏胥有上下其手之機。而殷實人家。憚於服役。又難免有頂名替代之事。使好事者得持以爲敲詐之資。故此舉實行而後。恐地方上不能無所非議也。</p>
<p>吾人不敏。以爲今日人民。實有一種義務應當加以强迫者。其意義蓋在鍜鍊體格。雖非推進建設。而實立一切建設之根基。我國人向不以體格爲重。病夫之謚。久已騰詬世界。際兹國難之日迫。彌覺孱軀之可恥。强迫訓練。遂爲必要。顧在施行之初。應策周全之方。以不抵觸個人職業爲原則。以不妨害細民生活爲前提。更應上下一致。蔑有例外。以蔚爲一時之風氣。而間執反對之藉日。同時復宜廣事曉喻。曲加解釋。使人民瞭然於體格之必須資重於訓練。而當局非有他意之存在。夫然後趨從者衆而收效自廣。救國之原在是。增加一切建設之精神力量亦在是。較之以義務服役爲標榜。爲道不旣弘　歟。</p>

<h3>籌開　京漢間特快輪　上水祗三十二小時　下水僅需廿四小時</h3>
<p>招商局計劃開闢長江綫京漢特别快輪、與各鐵道啣接、此事在峨輪未觸礁時、即着手籌備、頃湖北建設廳航政處對於京漢特别快輪、認爲亟須開航、特擬具辦法與招商局接洽、規定派三船行駛、業經招商局接受其計劃業由船舶科着手規劃辦理、各情查誌如下、</p>
<p>增航理由鄂建廳航政處長張延祥君所提議之京漢快輪、其理由係現時鐵部已與招商局訂立水陸聯運合同、則長江船上下水貨必較他公司輪爲多、貨物運輸、裝卸費時、　長江各埠往來旅客、必爲同航路洋商輪船攬奪、利權外溢、與國輪客帮營業頗有重要關係、故必增航特快班輪、以資挽救、</p>
<p>縮短行程六公司現行長江船、如以南京爲起點、而上水至漢口、最快者必須五十二小時至於從漢口開出、下水東航、以順流之故、自較迅速然平均核計、各江輪在下行班亦必三十六小時、若改航京漢特快輪後、一面將無關重要碼頭、會不靠停、規定京潯漢三埠爲正式停泊埠、則上水船祇須三十二小時便可到遠、下水更速、僅二十四小時即可到埠、每次往來、可縮少行程、至三十餘小時、</p>
<p>車輪聯接京漢特快班輪、在南京開船、規定上午十時可接聯津浦與京滬之符快車至九江在下午、更能聯接南潯路快車、翌日抵漢、更可與武長特快車啣接、在漢留一宵、次早九時開、又可與平漢與湘鄂之特快車聯絡、至回航到京、又可與滬平特快、京閘聯快車啣接、現湘鄂平漢等路、已經接治、一經開班、旅客當必擁擠也、</p>
<p>規定三輪查京漢特快輪、鄂建廳與招商局磋商、須請派調長江輪三艘行駛、方足供應需求、每船往來一班、連停泊時間、約需四天、比較現在長江輪每往來一班、須八日至九日者、則水脚收入、自可增多、以三輪供行、可望每日開駛一輪、而京·漢兩地、逐日均有特快班輪來去、</p>
<p>票價擬定鄂建廳航政處並擬定特快輪上下水客票價分爲三等、一等室上艙面二十四元、下艙面二十元、又舖位上艙三十六元、下艙三十元、二等上艙十四元、舖位二十四元、下艙十二元、舖位二十元、三等上艙八元、舖位十二元下艙七元、舖位十元、</p>

<h3>成事不說</h3>
<p>— 拾玖</p>
<p>「成事不說」，乃是聖訓。這句話深人人心，足足已有數千年了。别事且不諒，小防打架是數見不鮮的。張家阿毛給李家招弟打了一頓。自然囉，阿毛要一把鼻涕，一把眼涙，奔回去告訴給姆媽聽的。那姆媽將怎樣呢？伊固不免有些肉痛，可是一想到「金鄕鄰，銀親眷」，心裏的氣也祇好强忍下來了；况兩家又是貼鄰，素相往來丨李家大嫂朝朝同上小菜塲，夜夜同游大世界丨難道爲了這區區小事，兩下就此翻臉不成，便是阿毛的爸爸，從洋行裏回來得知此事，也要稱讚他老婆能力持大體不置。其理由是因爲兩下打架已成事實，旣成事實，就是眇駡也無益，反不如放開肚皮，免傷和氣。這就是聖訓深入人心所致。</p>
<p>「中一和三字，爲我國修齊治平之本。「中也者，天下之達道也；和也者，天下之大本也」。這是間接的聖訓。「中二和」的效力有這樣大，故中國所以能安而復危，危而復安，未始不因百姓具著這種美德所致。這雖似越說越遠，然苟一細譯「成事不說」之旨，則豈非與「中」「和」若合符節？外國小孩兩下打起架來，他們的姆媽怎樣處置，我因没福娶過外國老婆，并且也没有出過洋，所以不敢妄斷。不過外國人的德性總及不來我國人的中和。據此推測，外國「阿毛」的姆媽或者不肯干休，亦未可知。這，在我國人看去，固然要譏伊們不識大體；然而我們要原諒，因爲伊們不曾讀過「成事不說」的聖訓啊。</p>
<h3>一些感想</h3>
<p>— 錢健</p>
<p>在熱閙的靜安寺路上，摩托卡像風馳電掣的駛動，不斷地駛動。轆轆的電車，隨着軌道蠕行，往復地蠕行。而機汽脚踏車的劇烈聲響，摩托卡的汽笛聲和各種聲音的噪雜，顯示出十二分的歡樂，愉快，繁榮。</p>
<p>人行道的一邊，一扇烏黑的門懶洋洋地半開半閉着。從門口走向裏去，有兩行高大的楓樹被秋風吹的狂呌起來，葉子一片一片地飛到甬道上和十字架的墓地上。而和藹的愛神，伊手裏拿了長形的葉片，確表示異常的沉悶，孤寂，冷酷。丨丨原來這是外國墳墓的所在地。十字架滿佈四處，參差的矗立。同時，有各種異色的花朶也觸到眼簾裏來：這已經證明他們（或者伊們）沉默寡言，與世長辭了。</p>
<p>有一角，大理石和鐵欄圍着他的四週，石上發出晶亮的反射光。愛神和藹地侍在他的兩旁。墓中的碑上，刻着一行一行的金字，上面載他生前的歷史和死前死後的年月日及所享的年齡，並且，碑上嵌着他面龐豐潤氣概昻昻的磁照。而美麗的花朶，擺在他的靈前，發出馥郁的香味，來安慰他的靈魂；蒼翠的樹木，環繞他的四週，放出新鮮的空氣，似乎來舒適他的身心。唔！他們何等的榮華呢？</p>
<p>在另一角，祗有烏黑的木製十字架歪斜着，蓬斷草枯的墓前，佈滿了破瓶的碎片和零亂的瓦屑。甚而，一堆草叢，也表示死者靈魂的寄託地。唔！他們何等的寂寥和悽凉呵！</p>
<p>從這樣看來，墓上有精美的設備，我們可以推想到死者生前的榮華與享樂：同時，假如祗有荒塜做幽魂的寄託處，那末我們也可以推想出死者以前的貧窮與受苦。</p>
<p>唉！榮華的人死後也榮華的，享樂的；貧窮的人死後也貧窮的，受苦的。</p>
<p>唉！假如死後有靈的話，那末，一般已死的窮人，或許要涕泗長流吧！</p>
<h3>信不信由你</h3>
<p>— 金笳</p>
<p>依着一般說，凡是在世界上做出大事業的人，往往不是那些幸運之神的寵兒，倒反是那些「没有機會」的苦孩子。</p>
<p>你的成就之大小，永遠不會超出你的自信的大小。</p>
<p>談話的精粗，優劣，最足以顯示出你的敎育程度，與身價的高低。</p>
<p>經濟窘迫，事業慘淡，生活艱難；這是「眞正的人」獲得最大的長進的時候。</p>
<p>一個人假使常常以爲自已能力不足以成功，則他决無成功之理。</p>
<h3>從怕老婆說起</h3>
<p>— 戀戀</p>
<p>大概一個人之所以會對成某一件事物或某一種情形發生怕的觀念，至少爲了對方有足以畏懼和威脅自已的動機在·而怕之是否會必然發生，還得視自已膽略勇氣而定·但可笑娶了老婆而不怕的男子，據說却是很少很少·</p>
<p>我有很多同學，在未曾結婚以前，都是十足的英雄主義青年，無論說一句話，做一件事，總是高昻激烈，惟我獨尊，偶而談到女人問題，他們都不屑研究似的笑笑·至於說男子會怕老婆，他們就一百二十個不信，他們會說「我輩堂堂男子漢怕什麽？在女人面前雌伏，還配做大丈夫嗎」！他們的話未嘗不是說得漂亮乾脆，可是當他們結婚過了之後，我再去問問他們，他們都噤若寒蟬，什麽話也不再多說，只淡淡地說：（世界上不怕老婆的男子有幾？」</p>
<p>本來，英雄難過美人關，前人早已言之·但不知道在外國，昔日的拿破崙，今日之希特勒，對他們老婆的態度又如何？</p>
<p>「河東獅吼」，原是怕老婆者形容老婆聲勢之壯的語調·獅爲百獸之王，其慴服羣獠，也只在一聲怒吼，不過，把老婆比做獅子，自身願作從臣，其可憐可笑的態度，已經畢露無遺了·</p>
<p>可是說正經話，在今日中國女權高張的氣象下，一個女子能認清自身地位而起來做一番偉舉，其成功的機會和希望，硡確實要比男子多，獅子是象徵中國的，獅而能醒能吼，未來的希望未始没有，可是牠睡得四平八穩，什麽知覺都没有，至於河東獅，也只有在屋子裏吼吼，所謂女權也者，如此而已，要像林語堂所謂「讓娘兒們來幹一下」，那末，爲河東獅者，應該别轉頭來，跨出屋子去吼一下子才是·</p>
<h3>霜打菜</h3>
<p>— 金羊</p>
<p>這兩天的老正興館裏，該是炒菜心當令的時候了！不論肉片炒，開陽炒，……或者戰是暈油清炒，我想誰都會讚美這菜心滋味長的。</p>
<p>菜要到立冬以後，方漸漸地好喫起來，原因是很簡單的，因爲霜已經開始給颷颷的寒風吹降到地面。它濳入了菜的心，它飄滿了菜的葉。霜打過了的菜，才糯，才甜。</p>
<p>霜是普遍地廣被於地面的一切的，它打着菜，同樣的也打着人！</p>
<p>那些每夜非到三四時不得回家的夜的勞働者；那些每天在月亮還没西沉已經三五成羣的走着，或一堆一堆擠滿在單輪的小車上推動着，從隱匿在都市另一角的貧民窟裏奔向工廠的烟突進行，比「日出而作」還要辛勞好許的男女廠工們，他們都是慣受風雨摧殘，飽經霜露侵凌的「生之苦」者：</p>
<p>他們的感覺，當然遠不及吾們的詩人那樣銳敏，但終究未曾完全麻木吧？在他們每一個簡單的腦筋裏，每一個微弱的心底裏，該湧起些什樣的情緒？在又是風緊霜露重的初冬的深夜！初冬的黎明！</p>
<p>更正星期日「蟹特刊」「蟹脚」篇第十七行「詩人陳龜蒙」句「陳」字係「陸」氏之誤，特此更正。</p>
<h3>東北四連長</h3>
<p>— 張恨水</p>
<p>第十九回　欲卽欲離同車憶往事　半哭半笑倚枕病殘秋</p>
<p>及至上了車子以後，想到積之對於自已，便是一個泛泛之交的舊街坊，如何可以當着許多人，和他握手。幸是這車上，並没有一個熟人，要不然，這話傳到海甸去，那還了得？，他心裏想到了這一層，使不由得砰砰亂跳。可是積之那裏明白這一層緣故？這車裏的坐凳，乃是靠了兩邊的車壁，拉長了兩條木板子。買票的人，擁着上了車，早就把座位擠得一些空當都没有。積之早是預備了這一着棋，把身子斜斜的坐着，伸開了兩隻腿，佔住板凳一些地位。桂之站在車中間，正没有主意，積之連忙坐了下來，極力的擠着，騰出車角落裏一隙空位，手就連連拍着道：坐下罷，坐下罷！桂枝站在這裏，一些辦法没有，有人空出地位來請坐下去，怎好不坐？只得一挨身子坐了下來。可是正當坐了下來的時候，心中立刻生了一個感想？自已和積之感情極好的時候，也不曾這樣的坐在一處，如今是有了丈夫的人了，倒是這樣親親的和他擠在一處坐着，這不是一種意外的事情嗎？也許他是有心這樣做圈套的，可不要上他的當。然而已經是坐下來了，又没有可以站起來的理由。要不然，這樣長的路程，自已有位子不坐，站在汽車裏，人家不會說我進個人瘋了嗎？於是就身子一偏，將背對了積之那邊。車開了，車子上的人，也開始談着話。積之心裏，也就想着，從前和桂枝最親密的日子，也不曾這樣挨肩疊背的坐在一處。現在呢，他身上有一種暗藏的脂粉香氣，若有若無的向人鼻子裏面送了來。聞到之後，令人說不出所以然的，有一種快感（二五二）</p>
<p>人物小誌</p>
<p>— 金孑</p>
<h3>鄭律師酒</h3>
<p>酒眞是一件雅俗共賞的東西，而且是有史以來，就有牠的踪跡，我們看列國志，便不難發現許多酒字，和許多跟酒有最密切關係的醉字；秦漢以後，酒的勢力越發擴張了，淳於髠，劉伶之輩，竟因善喝酒而名揚四海，萬古流芳，他們的令德令聞，至今還在一班酒鬼的口角上掛念着。還有那些會寫文章的朋友，如李太白歐陽修之流，也因旣能寫文章，又會吃老酒而相得益彰，享盛名於千載。不過他們固然是受了酒的襯托，受惠非淺；但是酒也虧得仗他們這樣一宣傳，頓時提高了身價，使後世之名流學者，咸知酒之可吃，而得不爲道學家所禁絶，至民國，遂有羅文幹鄭天錫二先生同長法曹，同嗜花彫白蘭地之韵事。</p>
<p>羅文幹先生的酒量如何，酒癮如何，小子却不曾知道，未敢代吹，但聞羅先生前次患目疾，雙目盡赤，醫生敎他千萬不要再渴酒，但是他祇守了半天的戒，晚上又照例的大碗大壺的灌起來了。於此可見一斑。如今言歸正傳，單說鄭天錫先生，鄭先生是一個大胖子，從前曾在上海當律師，據說他無論律務忙到怎樣，下午打過六點鐘，便非喝酒不可了，什麽事情他也不肯再顧問，一味低斟淺酌，到晚方休。可是他是怎樣歡喜喝酒，却有三種值得佩服的好習憤：第一他從不喝得酩酊大醉，第二他非萬不得已，不喝外國酒，第三每天所喝的從不超過定量；因爲他雖然天天和酒在那裡做淘伴，竟從不曾亂過性。</p>
<p>鄭先生對於的辨别力極强，是好是壞，一上口就知道。他因爲是王寶和同志主顧的緣故，有一次，他竟徵得了店主東的許可，把他們店裡所有的酒，逐種逐種的試嘗過去。嘗到末了，鄭先生便指出某一種酒實在是無價的珍品，店主東聽了，歡喜不盡，他說鄭先生眞是能吃酒的人，才配吃這種酒，從那一天起，他便知照了跑堂的，凡逢鄭先生去喝，准予把那一種特製美酒供給他。其時鄭先生還在當律師，於是店主東和跑堂的便稱那一種酒曰「鄭律師酒」，以資紀念。</p>
<h3>黃局長飯</h3>
<p>吃飯是人生唯一大事，也是唯一常事，何足希罕。但是現任京滬滬杭甬鐵路局局長黃伯樵先生的吃飯，却實在不是一件平常的事情，烏可不記。</p>
<p>黃局長在好幾年前，就害了糖尿病，不但生育絶望，而且外强中乾，動不動就要躺倒。於是他就聽了醫生的囑付，實行吃飯的定性和定量。所謂定性就是規定飯的性質。他所規定的是極簡單的幾種：第一是黑麵包，（又名麩皮麵包）略塗牛油；第二是黃米飯。菜是着重流質的，而且太鮮的也不吃，多小粉質的也不吃，所吃的祗是極少的幾樣。至於定量呢，就是規定所吃的麵包和飯的分量，所以不論他自已請人家吃飯，或是人家請他吃飯，他所需要的祗是一盆湯而已。到吃的時候，他先說了一聲請，故從自已的衣袋裡，掏出二三塊由他夫人替他稱好分量，切就後用白紙包好的黑麵包來，慢慢地咀嚼着。如果在他家裡，那末他吃的必然是一○也由他夫人替他親手種過的黃米飯，大概多一粒也是不會的。</p>
<p>以上的情形，據說他已實行了五六年之久，雖然糖尿病不曾全愈，精神確比從前好了。</p>

<h3>第三屆公展杯第一日　中華高占優勢　四比一勝西人　本屆雪恥有望</h3>
<p>昨晚六時、第三屆國際手球賽公展杯、在西青開幕、前往作壁上觀者中西人士數十餘、我華隊本屆仍由中青代表、五組單打、獲勝四塲、奪得四分、西隊雖極强幹、然祇因華隊雪恥志决、平日苦練、卒能旗開勝利倘今日仍繼續努力、則本屆錦標、大有希望、</p>
<p>第一組國手朱寛、名符其實、連勝兩局、二十一比八、二十一比十四、態度從容、舉止安逸、對方察氏、右手殺球之凶猛、稱西青之冠、但一經交手、高下立分、朱寛出神入化之技藝、博得滿室采聲、察氏敗於英雄、亦五體投地、認爲生平唯一之勁敵、</p>
<p>第三組孫道勝對馬盧夫、一中一西、均有十數年悠久之歷史、孫氏左右兩手、擊殺咸能、策略見長、股力欠足、馬氏長於久戰、深悉地理、獨右手不及左手之佳妙、其連敗兩局、無反抗餘力者、蓋其弱點、早爲孫氏窺破、始終運用心機、攻人之短、控制全局、戰勝强敵、或謂此乃孫氏年來得意之作也、</p>
<p>第五組洪汝霖少年英俊、素以靈巧見長、對手卜金絲、係其歷屆勁敵、此次又相見一塲、洪氏抱必死之心、奮勇作戰、第一局雖負、相差尚近、第二局則全在卜氏手掌之中、比數距離甚遠卜氏在昔曾稱雄一時、兹以年老、乃屈居於第五位、其藝術固猶非常人所及、</p>
<p>第七組嚴兆容富於股力、長於殺擊、在本届中青會員等級賽、卽爲突入前十位置、至今尚猛進未已之唯一人物、昨勝喜爾、如囊中取物、無足介意也、</p>
<p>第九組陸夢聲二比一勝尉特、第一局之失敗、大意之故、第二局陸氏左右兼施、隨心所欲、第三局尤縱横一時、鋒芒無比、蓋其才能、固在對方之上也、</p>

<h3>昨晚西青籃球　約翰敗於南星　丨四十三比二十四丨　乙組東吳勝初級四二比十三</h3>
<p>昨晚西青籃球重要節目爲南星與約翰之戰、南星球藝、與日俱進、傳遞聯絡、投籃美妙、包新弟周怒安及劉景峯、尤爲出色、約翰係新起勁軍、血氣方剛、不幸於開賽後五分鐘内、主將誠景星傷脚退塲、實力大遜、致被南星以四十三比二十四勝、又乙組東吳對初級、毫無藝術可言、東吳以四二比十三勝、</p>
<p>東吳勝初級（乙）七時半開賽、初級名副其實、球藝平庸、東吳控制裕如、穩操勝劵、惟局勢混亂、進退無序、加以不時調人、益使比賽進行弛緩、興趣全無、上半時十九比六、結果四十二比十三、東吳勝、</p>

<p>南星勝約翰（甲）開賽接觸、南星前鋒、卽大施活動、周怒安與包新弟如兄如弟、心手相應、極有聯絡霎時間、已得六分、約翰力圖反抗、不料誠景星傷脚甚重、遽爾離場、調以張元吉、士氣大衰、陶祖柟還中一球後、南星包圍二將、連連射中、如同串珠、約翰陣容散温、一籌莫展、加以南星劉景峯等、戒備嚴密、無隙可乘、上半時南星由包周二君各得十分、約翰僅五分耳、再戰聲中、約翰氣熖如熾周學賢馬芳粹、大爲活動、吳幼良陶祖柟保駕有功、南星雖勇、不敢造次、分庭抗禮、互有得失、局勢異常緊張、形勢反趨平衡、且約翰時佔上風、一度成三十一比二十一、約翰僅落後十分、但自此以後、南星鋒芒又盛、前鋒二將之傳遞投籃、美妙非凡、使約翰顧此失彼、疲於奔命、最後結果、南星以四十三比二十四勝、包新弟與周怒安各得十八分、爲南星之二大功臣、</p>

<p>江南田徑隊、爲準備明年在菲舉行之遠東運動會起見、本年冬季、擬繼續不斷、加功練習、此爲發下戰書、向白虹挑戰、擬於本星期六作一對抗比賽、（地點請白虹定）、藉此雙方得以練習、查白虹於上星期與日俄僑作三角比賽、興緻勃勃、惜日俄僑缺乏能手、成一面倒之形勢、使白虹諸健强將、英雄無用武之地、今有此機會、當無不歡欣鼓舞、以此本星期六又將有田徑比賽參觀、</p>

<h3>全黑籃球努力勝白光</h3>
<p>全黑與白光兩籃球隊前晚作友誼賽於中華籃球房、查日光係東亞體專之精華、身高力大、全黑則短小精悍、爲業餘球隊中之佼佼者、故一時慕名來觀者數百人、七時半、由王華庭君担任裁判、銀笛一聲、白光三數傳遞、張芳梅首開記錄、不久凌順坤還他顔色、入後全黑利用短傳、更以瞿錫麟出没敵陣、致使白光心寒、錯悮時見、上半時以十二對十六落後、檸檬後、白光曾造成二十對二十三之機會、但全黑究非弱者、賈幼良周智等均有優美之表演、使白光無超出之能力、結果以三十對三十八敗北、聞此賽係瞿錫辦在滬最後一戰、故不啻全黑與瞿氏分手之臨别紀念云、全黑位　犯分　白光位　犯分</p>

<h3>專件中國　近代敎育思想概觀（九）　舒新城講述孫育才筆記　女子敎育思想</h3>
<p>女子敎育思想、在全部敎育思想史上、自有它的相當地位、現在只能暫時先講它變遷上的幾種名稱、詳細須參考著作、賢母良妻主義敎育思想、女國民敎育思想、男女平等敎育、女子敎育、三十多年來的女子敎育思想、雖然枝節很多、但大體上總可分爲以上四條主幹、這四種思想能産生、不是偶然的、是有共同的原因、特殊的背景的、前者是社會組織的變更、後者是家族思想、國家思想、人權思想、科學思想的激盪、不過女子敎育、要和另子爲同樣的發展、仍不可不本科學的女子敎育思想方針、特别努力、</p>
<h3>今後敎育上的新途徑</h3>
<p>要定今後中國敎育思想的傾向、第一要知道敎育是人類活動底一部份、絶不能離其他活動而獨立、社會政治經濟各方面的理想與事實、都足以支配敎育、所以敎育的改造、絶不只是一個敎育的問題、而是社會政治經濟各方面的問題、我們在此地雖然以研究敎育問題當作中心、但萬不可預存偏見、以爲敎育萬能、或敎育無效、我們所當注意的、只是敎育是人類活動中的一部份的事實、牠雖然不能離他種活動而獨立、但牠底改造、却也影響及於他種活動、因此我們要指示今後敎育途徑、應當看清社會政治經濟各方面的情形、建立一個可以達到目的的康莊、其次、中國現在的情形很特殊、世界潮流、旣然從各方面逼迫她向工商業制度的路上走、而她底舊組織可從各面丨交通阻滯、兵匪横行牽掌制着、不許她向那而走、在這過渡的時候旣不能保留舊的、也不能全用新的、應得斟酌於二者之間、另闢一條新路、</p>
<p>現在中國政治不上軌道、社會兵匪横行、無秩序無組織、經濟頻於破産、而兩橛的社會生活現象、又仍然如故、中國所以弄到這樣地步、有兩個總因、第一是列强底壓迫、第二是國民對於國事中了「不在其位不謀其政的儒家政治思想底毒、</p>
<p>自從「九一八」而後、國際間的所謂正義和平、已由事業昭示我們、不足盡信、自洛桑會議、軍縮會議無結果以來、更顯示所謂列强的經濟無出路、戰爭不可避免、蘇俄五年計畫的成功又復暗示我們經濟和民智、對於建國力量的偉大、此後我們要求中華民國獨立於世界之中、中華民族永存於大地之上、惟有努力自强、努力建設、在自强建設的過程之中、敎育自然愈益顯其工具的重要、</p>
<p>我們明白中國的癥結所在、那麽今後敎育新的途徑、究是什麽呢、這有左列幾種、就是我已講過的、一·生産敎育、二·鄕村敎育、三·民衆敎育、四·民族復興敎育、</p>
<p>我們深深地希望敎育界同志、努力於生産敎育、鄕村敎育、民衆敎育、民族復興敎育、更望敎育者注意敎育以外的政治、經濟、社會各方面、以謀敎育上的恊調、而共同担負着建國設家、復興民族的責任、（完）</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<h3>著作生活與奴隸</h3>
<p>— 唐弢</p>
<p>從來靠著作來維持生活，總是很清苦的。所以當巴東（ＢernadBarton）要脫離銀行的職務，專事著作的時候，闌姆（ＣharlesLamb）便寫信去阻　止他？呌他安心坐在銀行的辦公室裡。信裡曾這麽說：</p>
<p>「如果仰承書賈的鼻息，絞取你的腦汁去換一壺麥酒，幾塊羊肉，使你自由的思想和流連的詩句變做買賣工作，那簡直是奴隸生活，壞過於一切奴隸的生活。」</p>
<p>「保持著你的銀行罷，那銀行便會維持你，不要去理會世俗人；如果要講究正人君子們所顧慮的身份之類，那你就難免要弔死，餓死，溺死你自已。」</p>
<p>蘭姆先說著作生活的苦處，並不像理想那麽高尚安閑；而且想藉此來維持生活總覺得靠不住，所以大可不必捨了性命去追求世俗人所拘拘的身份之類。他雖說著作生活困苦得像奴隸，而實際還不是眞的奴隸。</p>
<p>中國人掛賣文的招牌，在從前並不多見。可是靠文字吃飯，郤是「由來已久」了。考狀元，中舉人，奪紅藍頂子，總要會寫一篇「歌頌聖德」的妙文，看得皇上「龍顔大悅」；於是妙文傳誦，好官到手，而生活問題也於以解决。</p>
<p>這麽着，一部中國文學史，正如郁達夫先生所說，成了一部十足的「奴隸史」了。</p>
<p>我怕這種妓隸倒是眞的，但也没有甚麽大關係。因爲奴隸在中國，並不像在外國那樣可惡。中國似乎不大會有蘭姆。傳統的觀念告訴我們，做有身份的奴隸是件光榮而且可以享樂的事；問題倒並不在於生活。所以你萬一去阻止别人，是免不了要得罪的。</p>
<p>洎乎近世，賣文的招牌一塊塊豎起來了。生活是還得生活的，我們終不能勸每個作家都去做Ａmateur，所以寫文章拿稿費，業經明文規定，果眞不必「追究」的。但問題自然是爲了生活。如果是生活以外的享樂，光榮，發財，有身份的奴隸等等，那可不在此例了。</p>
<p>但古法畢竟是不該廢除的。奴隸而有身份，「世人皆優爲之」。</p>
<h3>京戲鑑賞家</h3>
<p>— 繩夫</p>
<p>我不常看京戲，但我並不是梁漱溟先生的信徒，以爲白相了一次梅郎，就會感到内心的不安。自然，不是自已對藝術有更深的見解，看不起京戲，所以不願到戲院去。我之不常看戲，倒是因爲自已没有閒暇，同時缺乏做一個京戲鑑賞家的天才。</p>
<p>京戲鑑賞家，我是十分佩服的，據說大概可分爲三種丨</p>
<p>一種，其實還不能算是眞的「家」，就是指我這類戇大，平日不大進戲院，偶一光臨、却是一位臺前的「讀戲者」，對於臺而的熱閙，十分關心；對於扮作諸葛的是誰？她或他的她處怎樣？以及花樓上還有一些什麽樣的才子，佳人？却連意識也未意識到，祇是獃頭獃腦的在看戲，一齣一齣的看完了就了事。</p>
<p>一種，是較深刻的鑑賞家，他雖然也坐在臺前，却很少把眼睛注視到臺面，我們祗見他的活動，一會兒上了花樓，一會兒走入幕後，他們口裏忙着享受「口香糖」，「冰其淋」，手裏也許還拿了一張小刊物，總之，他是忙着，是在活動，似乎並不是看戲。可是，他比你獃頭獃腦的「讀，」還要深刻，他不僅能背誦劇情，扮演劇中的人物，他還知道她或他的一切秘密，私事；甚或那些東西本是不可對人言的。他爲什麽這般深刻呢？因爲他注意的是後臺，是扮演的人，不是在「戲」上，他們知道「戲」不是眞的，不過是唱來騙人嘻笑，騙人流涙罷了。他畢竟要高人一等，雙料的可稱一聲鑑賞家。</p>
<p>還有一種，我却祗在北平遇見過。這是一些入了三昧的鑑賞家。他們的尊齡大概都到「知天命」了。自已有三四十年鑑賞的歷史。有時也還做過戲，敎過學生的。所以，他們到戲院來，簡直用不着眼睛，我們祇見他們坐在遠遠的兩廂内，閉着雙眼喝「香片」，隨着裊裊的弦音，送着他的靈魂到另一世界中去。他們眞的入了三昧。自然，他們不上後臺，也不注意臺面的臉像，但是戲園老閭從不敢得罪他們，因爲他們有批判的權威，他們說出來的話，是不由你不承認的。</p>
<p>聽說北京改爲北平後，市面是蕭條了。最近又傳聞北平的京戲班中出了一派新進的人物到南方去組織了一個舞臺，正在廣徵昔日的名伶，羅致新進的後輩，預備再復興北京京戲昔日之勝。又據說，觀衆不愛看「狸貓換太子」了，這舞臺預備排演一些合於大衆口味的戲。近日以來，各地愛好京戲的人，都不免有點心爲之動，因爲傳聞的戲目，實在太新穎了，與舊調子的距離隔得過遠了。我是個對京戲無機緣的人，不想來批評這一張新的劇目，我不過在懷疑着，在擔心這幾位素以「狸貓換太子」著名的名角，會不會在這次新劇的排演中仍然現出狸貓的尾巴來。</p>
<h3>關於李後主</h3>
<p>— 尹川</p>
<p>後主李煜的遺聞軼事，散見於各家記載者甚多，若果下一番搜集工夫，很可以發現許多關於他的重要史料。就我所曾見到而還記得的，在宋孔平仲的「談苑」裏，是記着韓魏公藏有後主的畫竹，說上面有很多的題跋。明陳眉公的「珍珠船」裏，說「後主留意筆梮，所用澄心堂紙，李庭珪墨，龍尾硯，三者爲天下冠。」陸友仁的「研北雜志」說「袁伯長有李後主所用玉筆管，上有鐫字，文鏤甚精。」而「珍珠船」的另一紀載，簡直把他的軼事神話化了，原記說：</p>
<p>李後主得青石硯，墨池中有黃石如彈丸，水常滿，終日用之不耗，每以自隨。後歸朝，陶榖見而異之。硯大不可持，乃取石彈丸去。後主拽其手，振臂就馬。後主請以寶玩爲謝，陶不許。後主曰；惟此硯能生水，他硯皆不可用。陶試數十硯，水皆不生。後主索之良苦，陶不能捨，曰，要當碎之。石破，中有小魚跳出地而死。自是硯無復潤澤。</p>
<p>這些，是都足以帮助我們了解後主的生活情形，雖不能說是怎樣的重要材料。惟宋袁褧「楓窗小牘裏所記的一則，却是異常寶貴的，是記後主的題跋。後主的散文，是很不容易找到，忽得此文，眞是如獲重寶。原記云：</p>
<p>余嘗見内庫書「金樓子」，有李後主手題云：「梁孝元謂王仲宣，昔在荆州，著書數十篇，荆州坯，盡焚其書，今在者一篇，知名之士咸重之。見虎一毛，不知其斑。後西魏破江陵，帝亦盡焚其書曰：文武之道，盡今夜矣，何荆州坯焚書二語先後一轍也？詩以慨之曰：牙籤萬軸裏紅綃，王粲書同付火燒。不是祖龍留面目，遺篇那得到今朝？」書卷皆薛濤紙所抄，惟「今朝」誤作「金朝」，徽廟惡之，以筆抹去。後書竟如讖入金也。</p>
<p>後主詩文，在這短記裏，全都使我們見到，而「今朝」誤作「金朝」也可謂奇巧之至。在「研北雜志」裏，不僅有關於後主的記載，也有關於中主的畫像的事。其一是說，李伯時有雅第圖，後經王明清氏斷定正坐者，爲南唐李中主像。另一則則謂，「江南李中主，兄弟四人，圍棋，屏上書樂天詩，紙上着色人，皆如生。」是此畫且有關於李後主矣。今不知此畫流落何所，抑是否尚在人間也。因紀後主，一并及之。</p>
<h3>窮孩子</h3>
<p>— 徐轉蓬</p>
<p>媽媽剛偎了病着的小弟弟睡去，那一早就上禾塲去玩的七歲的孩子漲紅了臉趕回家了。</p>
<p>他突出那雙小而圓的褐藍的眼睛，尖起嘴巴向母親說：</p>
<p>「媽，賣竹頭百節蛇的討飯麻子又來了。」</p>
<p>「呵，」這鬼迷的傢伙，他會拐賣孩子，快關了門，躱在屋角里去……」</p>
<p>母親板起面孔，假正經的，這般恫嚇他。她知道孩子見了討飯麻子就要買他的竹頭百節蛇玩，就得化錢。</p>
<p>七歲的孩子已懂了一些事，他看見他的同伴個個都歡喜討飯麻子，看見他便快樂。他們跟在他後面，從街頭到街尾，從這條衖堂穿到那條衖堂，好像不肯放他走……討飯麻子看見孩子們也老是笑着臉的。</p>
<p>「媽，你騙我。我要買百節蛇玩……」孩子扯住母親的褲脚管，繞着母親的脚旋轉。在有鷄糞的地上打滾，用哭來要挾母親。</p>
<p>「下次再買吧，媽今天没有錢了。」</p>
<p>母親温文的話是没效的。孩子的哭臉，在没有得到百節蛇以前是不會變成笑臉的。</p>
<p>「小三子和五弟，他們都買了……」</p>
<p>「他們是有錢人家的孩子，你比不上他們……你來世投生到有踐人家去吧……」</p>
<p>七歲的孩子，没有懂得自家的貧窮，就是買一盒自來火的二個銅子也没有呵！他只看見同伴們要他也要。</p>
<p>討飯麻子跟着孩子們的哭聲走，這時，他立在她家門口了。</p>
<p>「買一隻給孩子玩玩，五個銅子小事，孩子哭傷了大事……」</p>
<p>有孩子的母親們，都厭惡他，正如一個魔鬼。他來到村上，孩子們特别多哭了。</p>
<p>「去，去！没有人要買你的百節蛇，别走到我家門口，下次不准走進我們村坊里來……」</p>
<p>就是暴風雨一般的謾駡，也不能趕走他的。他仍舊站立着，他要賣去他的貨色。</p>
<p>孩子看見要得到的東西没有上手，更任性的哭。</p>
<p>「好，討飯麻子，那末買你一隻，錢今天没有，下次來帶……」</p>
<p>「嘿！你想欠討飯鬼的賬？賣百節蛇的窮鬼倒不掛賬的……」</p>
<p>於是討飯麻子蔑視的投了一眼，唾一口痰在地上，走到别家門口去了。</p>
<p>做母親的受了委屈，帶着怒意，毆打孩子出氣。這時，母親要用打來阻止孩子的哭了。</p>
<p>「打死你這小混蛋，也不痛心……飯都没得吃，那兒來的閒錢買百節蛇玩……」</p>
<p>這一天，村上的孩子們特别多哭，許多母親打了他們的孩子……</p>
<h3>兩兄弟（四十三）</h3>
<p>— 莫泊桑著　李維克譯</p>
<p>於是他又慢慢地把昨晚在堤岸上，在汽笛的呼聲中使得他心痛的一切推想，一樣一樣地回想到了。他越想，越覺得這事毫無可疑。他覺得他被自已的邏輯向那使人難堪的事實引去，正像被一隻拖人且絞人的手引着一樣。</p>
<p>他口渴，他熱。他心跳着。</p>
<p>他立起身想打開窗户呼吸一下，但當他站着了時，隔牆傳來了一種輕微的聲響。</p>
<p>哲安寗靜地睡着，且在輕輕地打着鼾。他睡着，他！他什麽都没有預料到，什麽都没有猜測到！一個認識他們母親的男子把他所有的財産留給了他。他拿了錢，覺得這事是正大光明的，自然的。</p>
<p>他睡着，富足而又滿意，却不知道他的哥哥在苦悶欲絶。於是筆爾對於這没憂慮的，滿足的酣睡者發生了一股怒氣。</p>
<p>如果是在昨晚的話，他會去打他的門，走了進去，坐在他的床前，他會對那突然醒來而吃驚着的他說：一哲安，你不應當接受這筆遺産，這事會使别人懷疑到我們的母親，並因此損壞她的名譽。」</p>
<p>但是今天他再不能講了，他不能對哲安說他絶不相信他是他們父親的兒子。現在他得保着他這可恥的發現，把安理在心裏，他得把他瞧見的污點隱藏起來，不讓任何人發覺，卽使是他的弟弟，尤其是他的弟弟。</p>
<p>他現在已再不想到那不相干的與論的毁譽。他寗願大家都誹謗他母親，祇要他知道她是無辜的就行了，祇要他一個人知道就行了。他怎能每天和她一塊生活呢，看着她的時候便得想到她曾在一個陌生人的撫弄之下孕育了他的弟弟，這事他怎能忍受呢？</p>
<p>可是她是怎樣的寗靜而又爽朗啊，她現得怎樣的問心無愧啊！難道像她這樣的一個女人，一個有着純潔的靈魂和正直的心的女人，也會墮落，受着熱情的引誘，而以後却一點也不現出懊悔，現出曾經受着良心的責備嗎？</p>

<h3>糧食　期粉恐成套頭局面</h3>
<p>粉市昨日上午開盤後、各月份市面、大都平穩、以洋麥報價、仍然續小芝加哥又小二角零、坎拿大小五六角故開價時、人心見好、較之前日、近期見軟、遠期平定、旋以抛户見稀、買户反增、故市氣復轉穩態、迨至下午開盤、本月份局面忽見大變、因交易祇有一二日、業外多頭、均步步出籠、並聞回籠貨棧單、套頭均須交出、多頭則無此力量、所以步步傾跌、成殺多之象、遠期各月份、亦較上午帶落一二分、觀察後情、恐須仍造成套頭局面也、結果本月份跌三分半、十二月份跌一分半、一月份跌七厘半二月份跌二厘半、三月份跌五厘、四月份好二厘半云、</p>
<h3>期麥露盤旋之狀　丨丨本麥高貨步步提高丨丨</h3>
<p>期麥各月份市面、大致呈盤旋之局、以洋麥報價、雖見續小二角至五六角不等、惟本月份已經過去、遠期則以洋麥報小、雖無十分關係、但人心終須顧及、並因洋麥加稅、照所傳之數、合之目下市間、亦少帶動、因在事前已經提高、故目下反形若無事也、上下午盤旋之中、略轉軟檔、祇十二月份較小一分、餘則均無上落、現麥市面、見交甚少、惟高貨則步步提漲、如南宿州麥已開至四元三角、五河麥四元二角半、計七百包、由信大華豐辦去云、</p>

<p>（滬南）昨日到各帮米船七八十號、（近萬石）其中晚稻亦未見稀、（五六千石）其初市氣非常懈淡、及後賣方跌價、客家方始出手、又聞北洋班水脚將漲價、遂又競擬趕辦出運、市形復見踴躍、計天津青島烟台等帮、先後納進五千餘包、惟行情究以吃盤苛刻、仍難挽回、步跌尺外耳、本街店　較前爲旺、祇因到源尤湧、市况猶軟、計常帮蘇同帮南港等粳及杜洋尖、市價俱跌角砠、隂變元、酒户胃呆、續疲、</p>
<p>（滬北）河下各路到船五十三四號、市上各種去路尚佳、市形新粳、早市平疲、晚市轉定、羊杜、埠客秈平定之局、早薄稻帶緊數分、隂元價小二角、白元略削數分、</p>
<h3>粤帮乘客秈滯銷試辦　丨閩帮仍在觀望中</h3>
<p>昨日客秈市况、因數日來本客停頓、存底漸多、閩變尚有廣大趨勢、人心一致看小中、閩帮胃口雖活、乃被該地時局與經濟變化之影響、未克暢辦、因此市面逐步下趨、雖以産價高昂、成本甚大、然　因消滯趨軟、昨閩帮與本街均主擯守、惟粤帮趁此疲擋到市試辦若干、故一部份人心稍爲望好、計辦去湖南機紅米一百八十包、價七元零五分、南京機秈米二百包、價六元二角八分、比之上週售開之價各小三角左右、惟人心稍爲安定、倘粤帮再爲崵辦、閩帮重復向津、則市面亦易於轉機也、</p>
<h3>黃豆市價略回小</h3>
<p>昨市黃豆走銷略衆、出口仍觀望、廠家辦進碭山豆八百包、價扯三元六角、内地辦去河南歸德豆二百餘包、價售三元六角三分、本街成交正陽關豆二車、價開三元七角半至三元七角、又成交蚌埠豆二車、價爲三元五角半至三元五角、市况比較前日見挫四五分不等、</p>
<h3>南北貨厦圓肉號盤轉鬆</h3>
<p>厦門生晒圓肉、圖來到存均稀、但各方銷胃亦甚稀少市價不振、反見小跌、昨聞號貨業已開通、比前小去一二元、陳貨原價亦無續開、號存尚有、後市或須轉鬆、碼生晒肉以價高銷路更少、聞地價已回跌不少、故乏續開云、</p>
<h3>糖市五福白氷小去一角</h3>

<h3>絲市交易同歸沉寂　丨不論人造天然丨</h3>
<p>人造絲棉毛織品上市人造絲客銷益無起色、昨祇本埠綱廠進飛馬美女劉海等牌現貨十五箱、價自一百七十八元二角半至一百六十一元七角半　盤、</p>
<p>洋莊絲海外生絲市場、存厚銷滯、日絲跌勢仍銳、滬埠洋莊絲市益形萎靡、歐美各莊鑒于海外絲價與華絲商成本相差十元四五、故無絲電發出、市氣之呆滯達於極點、昨祇印莊進粗黃白絲經十二日價益趨疲、</p>
<h3>油市浙西新桕油開盤　祗百來件交易</h3>
<p>桕油當新貨將旺之際、市情日有變遷、近因浙邊軍事風雲陡起、金蘭一帶地處密　、商務影響、亦較顯明、而蘭桕油産數本在日增、見新時蘭行收價始定每砠十六元、旋增至十七元、乃自閩變發生、浙防吃緊、銀根爲商務之命脈、百物咸被掣肘、據近日蘭訊桕油市面亦受打擊·日見鬆跌、恐將回復十六元之原狀、浙西嘉興等處本車桕油、以上週漲屬最　、　　　　　　　　之、聞前昨兩日有内地車客到申、售開百來件、價格爲每担二十一元、較最鋒時已跌去一元左右、惟據今庚子價高昂、成本須在二十一元之外、此次雖因時局關係而見貶、然尚非售者所願、故後市似無續跌之望、但漢荆油依然疲弱滬上行家南北均可採辦、所以對於浙桕、取棄須依據合算與否、如不合則可舍南而就北也、因此每有交易、並無多數、蓋亦係受漢市之掣肘耳、</p>
<h3>五金五金市場中之鋒俏品</h3>
<p>二十六號白鐵瓦現貨、昨市　行告缺、標準以此凌空上升至每担十六元、如欲　一二十担、仍然　　十　　　　等候二三個月也</p>
<p>棋子鋼昨市估盤、每担竟能開至二百八十七元、比前好二元、調查現貨仍屬不多、頗有哥滙之希望、</p>
<p>粗鉛絲八號十號十二號等、昨日軍用方面有採辦、聞成交數達六七百担（聞此貨爲裝軍用電話之用）、故現貨頗形寥落、</p>

<h3>靜觀種種</h3>
<p>— 立齋</p>
<p>杜撰簇新的名詞和術語，顯然可以算是我們東鄰「友邦」的特長之一種。恐慌襲來，「友邦」名之日「不景氣」，胡佛緩債，又名之日「胡佛景氣」；内田上臺，我們就有機會領敎「焦土外交」，廣田出馬，我們又在領敎「理性外交」了。此外，最囂然於近頃「矮文」書報之中的，又有「靜觀」種種。對「支那排外運動」，採「靜觀主義」，現在對美俄復交，又要「靜觀」其未來展開了。</p>
<p>對於「靜觀」種種，不但「國貨」之中，並不缺乏，就是「國人」之中，也不乏「登峯造極」之士。所以，如果對於「友邦」的「靜觀」竟至羨而且歎者，那不是未嫻於「國學」，就是「儍」天下之大「瓜」！</p>
<p>在中國故事和成語之中，如「卞莊剌虎」「鷸蚌相持，都是以「靜觀主義」爲骨髓的。又如「三思而後行」，也是具有很濃厚之「靜觀的意味。「三思」之者，就是要「前」無危險，「後」無隱患，而「現在」有好處可以「不賖不欠」。這種水磨工夫，若非「靜」而「觀」之，如何做到？</p>
<p>至若「脚踏兩邊船」，「看風使舵」，更是「靜觀主義」之千古不刊的「經典」，而「國貨」的「政治家」或「貿易家」，對於此道，尤其是允稱「絶技」！</p>
<p>「靜觀主義」，對於個人的好處，是無往而不利的，若干「革命領袖」或慈善家」們之大發其財，實至名歸，無一不是從「靜觀」中得來。然而這種「先天下之利而利」的「靜觀」，對於民族國家，却往往是凶多吉少。所以，兩晋的「靜觀」之士太多，結果是請了王胡的異族來替中國造成一百多年的黑暗歷史，南宋的「靜觀」之士議論未定，金兵已經渡河。而現在，中國的「靜觀主義者」的數量和質量，更是極空前之大觀，然則我們的民族國家究將何往？這不看别的，只看看飄揚於長城各口的異國旗幟和一部分頭二三等的貴人們紛紛在上海「大英」或「弗蘭西」地界購置别野，裘英或地産，就可以依稀想是其未來了。</p>
<h3>輪下</h3>
<p>— 餘生</p>
<p>冬天的日子是特别的短，還不到六點鐘天就黑了。今天一交黃昏，又下着霖霖的細雨，所以這僻靜的馬路，更顯得分外的凄凉！</p>
<p>「嗚！嗚！」馬路旁的一個紗廠在拉回聲了，道間斷了的兩聲是表示着九點三刻鐘，將要換班的信號。</p>
<p>不到一刻鐘，這死寂的馬竟復活了起來，尤其是紈廠的門口；提着籃子呌賣的小販；閑　白相的「馬路英雄」門；拿着油鞋雨傘在等候着放工的工人的家屬：以及源源而來的上夜工的男女工人，將這短短的一叚馬路幾乎塞了個水泄不通。</p>
<p>紗廠大樓上的時鐘，一分一分他向前移動着，這活動而嘈雜的人羣也隨着時間的轉換而更形紊亂。</p>
<p>「嗚！」遠遠的一輛汽車馳來了。</p>
<p>「察！」當牠闖進這人堆中心的時候，突然發生了一聲巨嚮，每個人的臉上立時淨現　緊張，和用耳目來　　究竟的　帶。</p>
<p>「媽……救……命呀！」一種異樣慘厲和哀楚的聲浪，打破了這一刹那間的沉寂空氣丨丨</p>
<p>「汽車壓壞人了！」有人在大聲的喊着。</p>
<p>人羣立時騰沸起來，都不自覺地烏雲遮天似的捲了攏來，迅速地將汽車緊緊圍住。</p>
<p>引擎還未煞住，汽車夫想開足了馬力，就此一逃了事。</p>
<p>「拍！」汽車前廂的玻璃早被一個大塊頭的工人打破了一塊。</p>
<p>「媽的！停住，還想跑嗎？」好幾個同聲地喊着。</p>
<p>「打！」「打！」大衆狂喊。</p>
<p>「拍！」「拍！」「拍！」汽車上的玻璃接連又破了三塊。</p>
<p>「阿根！將車煞住呀！」坐在汽車後廂的紳士在對他的車夫發命令。</p>
<p>「呀！救……命呀！」已經啞了的聲音由汽車底下發出。</p>
<p>「人要死了，快點拖出來看看！」站在最前面的聰明的長子一句話提醒了大衆，人羣中立時鑽出三四個好好先生，一捲袖開始就拖。</p>
<p>「哎呀！……」痛極的慘號。</p>
<p>「車輪壓了左膀，汽車向後退。」</p>
<p>汽車夫將車向後緩緩地退了約莫五寸光　。</p>
<p>「好！」從大家的一聲好中由車輪縫裏拖出一個十七八歲的小姑娘來，馬路的污　和鮮紅的血塗滿了他的衣衫，頭髮，和嘴臉，急促的呼吸和着孱弱無力的呻吟，　邊還　　血，一只左　吊任背後。</p>
<p>「媽的！坐車的豬羅！還不滾出來！」人羣中尖銳的呌聲。</p>
<p>車門開了，從車廂　鑽出一個又矮又　有紳士，穿着一套很講究的西服，外面罩着全毛的花呢大衣，奸滑的臉上戴着一副眼鏡。樣子是那樣的狼狽，却故意裝出着很鎭靜的神氣。</p>
<p>「還好吧！没有壓壞吧！」紳士的口吻多少帶着幾分做作，音波微微地顫動着。</p>
<p>「媽的！人快要死了！還没有壓壞！」大個子憤地駡着。</p>
<p>「拍！」紳士的右臉上早着了一記耳光，半邊紅得像豬血。</p>
<p>「放文明點吧！横豎歸我負責！」紳士屈服了。</p>
<p>「乒！」腰上又挨了兩下，這是矮子打的，他的拳頭還揑緊着不肯放鬆，好像「仍須努力」的樣子。</p>
<p>「大家不要打吧！倒是先救人要緊！」聰明長子最關心被壓的人，一句話提了大衆，於是全體的目光重新移轉到那不幸的小姑娘身上，解了紳士的重圍。</p>
<p>「是呀！馬上送到醫院裏去，坐我的汽車，阿根！快下來扶他上車。」最會看風轉舵的紳士如得了一道赦旨，但他向着車夫發命令時，還保持着主人的尊嚴。</p>
<p>躱在汽車前廂角落裏的車夫阿根，被他的主人從惡夢中喊醒，他兩手托着小姑娘，的腰向前就推。</p>
<p>「不！我的飯盒呢？」道可憐的小姑娘，在他將要垂斃的時候，還記掛着他的生命丨丨飯盒！</p>
<p>「呵！眞的，大家帮他找來吧！」長子在發命令了，經過幾分鐘的忙亂，從距離汽車兩三丈遠的小溝裏發現了一隻鉛製的飯盒，本來是長方形的盒子，却變成六角式，飯是潑光了，由「派司」的方式很迅速地從人羣外面遞到了小姑娘的面前，他憑着車夫和三四個工人將他扶進了後霜，雪白褥墊上被他染遍了污泥和血。</p>

<h3>現代名人書畫</h3>
<p>巴叔海先生名成舉安徽歙縣人</p>
<p>「嗚！」人羣如火山爆發似的分開了一條裂縫，汽車從這裂縫中小心地通過後，就像臨刑的罪犯逃出了刑塲一樣，向前狂奔，終於消失在四濺的泥花和暗淡的燈光之下。</p>
<h3>統制經濟和計劃經濟</h3>
<p>— 素</p>
<p>統制輕濟一名詞，最近在中國智識份子的口中，時常聽到，都覺得在這農村經濟破産的今日，非實行統制經濟不能復興農村，所以中央已有經濟委員會的組織，其中聯係各種統制委員會、使一切生産在各個統制之下，能有適當的供應。</p>
<p>與統制經濟同時出現的，有所謂計劃經濟，有人說這就是統制經濟，又有人說這是統制經濟中的一部分，這都是錯誤的，現在分别說明如後：</p>
<p>統制經濟和計劃經濟都是經濟政策中的一種，兩者的内容，逈不相同，統制經濟是没有一定計劃的，僅在經濟發現病態時加以改正，如在生産不足時使牠增加，過剩時使牠減少。而計劃經濟却有一定的計劃，一切經濟抽活動，都依照一定的計劃進行，牠偏重在生産方面，從事大量的生産。</p>
<p>並且實行統制經濟的國家，承認私有財産的存在，不過加以相當的限制罷了。但實行計劃經濟的國家，决不許私有財産，因私有財産是妨礙計劃輕濟的進行的。</p>
<p>從上面可以知道：統制經濟注意於消費，而計劃經濟注意於生産，前者爲顧着現在，而後者爲打算將來，雖然兩者的形式，似乎不同，但最後的目的，都是使生産和消費保持均衡，不致有過剩或不足的現象。</p>
<h3>業餘信箱離婚决不是一件值得　提倡的事情</h3>
<p>編者先生</p>
<p>我的好朋友，一年前，由父母之命，媒妁之言，嫁於一個素不相識的男子。未婚前的她，曾在某某銀行辦事，平時總存着自立的志望；但是她不幸生在舊式腐舊的家庭中，以爲女大當嫁，當她只有十八歲的時候，不由她不願意，在父母的威嚴之下，就送進了一個繁雜的家庭中去了。結婚後不久，就死去了她的婆婆；上面雖没有大人，但是他的姊妹弟兄很多。他們倆的感情，亦由着意見不同，日趨惡劣。現在結婚雖祇一年，雙方竟决意脫離，對方並願意貼她的贍養費。但是她的母家，是陳舊的家庭，並且他倆都未到自立的年齡，這二種難解的問題，請</p>
<p>編者先生答復施佩珍謹上</p>
<p>編者按：離婚决不是一件值得提倡的事情，結髮夫妻，中道仳離，遺有子女的，其痛苦自不必說，即使没有子女的，其精神上所受的創傷，也是至深且烈。我們對於世間怨偶，爲着使他們比較的能享受幸福起見，自不能不許其合議離婚。但這種事件，好像一個人生了惡瘡，勢不能不施用刀圭；但對於病人的元氣，究竟是有害的。我們應該做一個社會病理家，探求這種怨偶的成因，大聲疾呼的同社會警告，求這種幸事件，能消滅於無形。</p>
<p>施君的女友，與其丈夫間的感情，業已破裂，譬諸惡瘡已成，直截離異，自屬正辦。至於父母頑固一層，倒可不成問題，就依頑固的說法，女子第一嫁當由父母作主，第二嫁就可以自决了；充其量以後得不到父母的助力罷了。至於尚未成年一節，法律上規定，已婚男女，不論他已未成年，均以有行爲能力論，自可不必顧慮。不過事　上年齡過水，不免易於受愚；這一次　成大錯，還可抱怨父母，日後再有差池，更屬於人無尤了。不離則勢難終日，離則茫茫人海，前途飄渺，是則有恃於至好之隨時提挈矣。</p>
<p>他們夫婦間的惑情，所以會如此决裂，據我們看來，原因雖甚複雜，但是最重要的一點，恐怕要算「大家庭制度」了。以一個平日身價自高的女子，處在許多叔伯妯娌姑樟之間，意見横生，自不能免。我們提議某女士等暫時不妨先生另組小家庭，意見的根原一斷，琴瑟重調，亦可能事也。試而無效，再離不遲。不知此項建議，能有幾分實現的可能性耳？</p>

<h3>上海（六）</h3>
<p>— 張老三</p>
<p>（十一）都市姑娘</p>
<p>我的對面是一羣上海典型的姑娘，聽她們無秩序的笑話，也是赴講經大會去會，大約像參加國貨展覽會，穿幾件土布旗袍，在名媛，皇后的恭維聲中出出風頭，也來一下茹素誦經。</p>
<p>她們都是一色打扮，一種灰色的絲織品，薄薄的一襲夾衫遠不及我們老布罩袍厚，短的袖子，硬的領頭。我的朋友說過一句乾脆話：「上海的姑娘，祇要時髦，什麽都肯幹，如其大人物倡辦模特兒選舉，她們一定剥了褲子趕來」</p>
<p>小黃在失戀後說出這樣的話，朋友們嘲笑他太没有勇氣，我却同情他這話也有一部份理由。因爲相起了這一類的話，我多幣了她們幾眼：她們也似乎注意到我。她們開始竊竊私議，我自知身上的，老布棉袍，在這車廂太不合時代了；不能做幾件挺硬的西裝，也須得硬領頭窄腰身的長袍，然而一半也是我自已的過失，不應敢多幣她們幾眼。偷望窗外，徐家匯將近，就不理會她們的訕笑，重展開報紙，避去她們的視線。</p>
<p>徐家匯今天像靜安寺的香汛，汽車接連地駛來：踏下電車，更有出人意外的一尋黃包車圍上來，我衝出重羣，向方外别墅走去，那一羣都市姑娘，忽然節省幾個銅子的黃包車錢，運動她們坐慣汽車美而不健的腿，一路笑語鶯鶯跟隨在我的後面，亦步亦趨，顯然以我這土老兒爲談話的中心。你們大概以爲我是維恭維敬赴大慈善家徐炳南的講經大會，自問是不合時代的人物，但是在上海以爲摩登的「講經大會」，也不應有我的份。你們以摩登之心，度土老兒之腹，這對於我的侮辱太大了。我返身恨恨地釘了她們一眼，她們反縱聲大笑，都市的姑娘啊！玩弄天天追隨在你們摩登旗袍下的公子哥兒吧，對我這土老兒開玩笑，你們的勝利，太不值一笑了！</p>
<p>（十二）萍弟是你</p>
<p>第一個昻首進方外别墅的來賓，都有一塊特製的徽章作護身符。我雜在人叢中被門房攔住，他不屑的稜起三角眼，向我衣襟上打量之後，</p>
<p>「幹什麽」！上司對下屬的專利口吻。</p>
<p>「可以見徐炳南先生嗎」！</p>
<p>我知道閻王好見，小鬼難當，廉和的問。</p>
<p>「今天不見客」！</p>
<p>我本想說明徐炳南是我的舅舅，一望身上的老布棉袍，誰都不信大慈善家徐炳南有這樣下流的外甥吧；於是我授了名片，還是卑躬的說：</p>
<p>「煩你進一張名片」。</p>
<p>不提防我聽過的笑聲，又從背後送來，那一羣女孩子正立在我的背後，爲首的一個，拍着手跳過來喊：</p>
<p>「萍弟，是你」！</p>
<p>我怔了一怔。那門房已站得像橱窗中的木人兒一樣顫聲的說：「小姐，回來了」。我纔知道是我從力打破她的金魚玻璃缸，哭了整天的表姊徐慧琴。她返身對那羣姑娘說：</p>
<p>「没有認錯啊」！她像賭博勝利似的再笑了」，你們在前廳等我，我引萍弟去見爸爸」。</p>
<p>「小姐，老爺在二姨太太房裏」。</p>
<p>門房可憐的望着我，他不料一個穿棉布袍的鄕曲，由小姐的弟弟。殷勤的說出老爺在二姨太太房裏，一半是率承小姐，還希望我在老爺面前不要說他待慢的話。我們不合時代的後生，碰二爺的釘子是隨處可以舉例的。看他們眼珠望天的態度，可恨自已爲什麽多讀幾年書，竟不及一個二爺的威風：但見了摇尾乞憐的苦臉，反而同情他們的環境。我善意的看他一眼，表姊不明白他的意思，恨恨的　他「我知道」！</p>
<p>後來探悉是表姊不滿意於每位姨太太的緣故。</p>

<h3>中國電影藝人訪問記（二十三）續十一月十四日</h3>
<p>— 沙基</p>
<p>（十）「都會的早晨」導演蔡楚生（上）</p>
<p>這又是一位極有希望的青年電影作家。他今年才二十七藏，在外國人的文學作品中，像他這樣年齡的人，恰好被稱爲怪可愛的孩子。可是他在「都會的早晨」中，已經有了不起的成就。</p>
<p>我想這决不是一時的讚揚，在他的作品中所表現出來的，誰也得承認他有着藝術的天才。而且我也並不是一個捧角周郎，我又幹嗎耍捧人呢？古時候，就有許多青年，對將軍們期望過高，眼巴巴的等他上台來治國平天下，於是乎大捧其場。誰知將軍們上台之後，一變而爲青獠牙的二花臉，大殺一通，從前曾經捧過塲來的，一個個在屠刀之下刴成肉醬。想起當年事，到如今總覺胆戰心驚，安敢捧場乎？</p>
<p>閒話少提，却說我在一天晚上，我從隂氣森森的延平路，走近了聯華二廠的攝影塲。在二樓的走廊，我看見以反派角色著名的袁叢美穿着挺漂亮的夜禮服，面如冠玉，唇若塗朱，尚冠武也對着鏡子在整理那剛剛粘上去的小鬍子。心領神會，我知道他們在打扮整齊又要走上銀幕了。</p>
<p>不久，蔡先生從下面走上樓來。我說「哈嘍囉」，他也說「哈囉」，於是相將而入導演室。在那裏，我看見在「如此英雄」和「清道夫」中領敎過二次的譚瑛在紙上藪藪作響的寫信。然而我不敢過於煩擾她，說一句天理良心話，我祇簡單的問了一句：</p>
<p>「譚瑛女士近來演了什麽戲？」</p>
<p>「風」，他說：「吳村先生導演的……」以下便聽不清楚了，我只得跟着點點頭。其實，對於女明星如此冒昧，已經很夠了。至於以女明星爲「大衆的愛人」的先生們，那却不可同日而語也。</p>
<p>不久，蔡導演自大衣荷包裏掏出一包口香糖來，我嚼着一片，軟柔而甜蜜蜜。只聽得他說：</p>
<p>「好了，現在茶，烟，糖三色俱備，談話可以開始了。</p>
<p>「我想還是請你隨便談談罷。」我說。</p>
<p>「可是你敎我說什麽好呢？」他說：「在這大變亂的年頭，說話眞是不易。我有好幾次想給貴報做一點文章，但因種種關係，我也只得「金人三緘其口」了。這是一　方面。另一方面，當電影還停留在鴛鴦蝴蝶派手裏的時候，我到還敢寫一點東西，可是現在許多前進的文學家都來注意電影了，我就不敢拿筆寫東西了。我讀書不夠，淺薄，不懂得理論，假如我也來寫點什麽，不簡眞是班門弄斧麽？所以我想還是請讀者在我的作品中來認識我。」</p>
<p>讀者諸君一你們看見他是多麽自廉啊。其後禁不了我的催促，他到底長篇大論的說起來了。</p>
<p>「中國電影，到現在總算有了一二年的歷史，可是到現在是否就担負它應有的使命呢？這還是一個大疑問。一方面固然是經濟拮据，然而到現在已經慢慢的消失了那種危險的嚴重性，所以現在最需要的到是健全的人材。</p>
<p>「說到電影人材，那眞是不容易造就。譬如說做一個導演，就要是各方面的學問。電影是綜合的藝術，文學，戲劇，繪畫，雕刻，建築，音樂等等，以至於人情世故，對於社會的體念，都需要有深刻的修養和認識。可是檢查一下中國的電影人材，那可以說自有歷史以來，從來没有一個完全的。同時各人從事電影的動機也非常複雜，也有本來就不懷着好的動機而來的。因爲這個原故，要中國電影走上健全的大道，至少在目前没有可能。（未完）</p>
<h3>影片談評　「玫瑰别墅」</h3>
<p>— 評摩爾</p>
<p>“ＡtTheVillaRose”</p>
<p>偵探影片的社會根據，是和武俠影片同樣的，我們本來用不到多說：我們只要一問所謂「偵探」，是替什麽人服務，就可以知道了！</p>
<p>因爲通俗小說「歇洛克福爾摩斯」銷路的廣大，全世界人都知道了英倫的偵探手腕，所以對於英國偵探片「玫瑰别墅」，在情節上，我們是多少存些希望的。</p>
<p>但是這希望，終於打破了。偵探片的長處，自然全在「疑陣」，換一句話說就是情節的離奇，不過無論多少「疑陣」，多少離奇，結果總是讓觀衆漸漸的明瞭的。但是這張「玫瑰别野」，完全不是這樣。本事的最後一節，很簡單的叙述了影片的後半部：</p>
<p>「……其結局殊有出人意表者，兇手誰屬非至最後之一刹那，吾人猶在暗中摸索也」。自　像「玫瑰别墅」那樣方法，是可以使觀衆格外感到奇特的。但是觀衆的感覺，一定感到太奇特，因爲中間没有一點可尋的線索。</p>
<p>導演者處理偵探影片原是最難的，因爲把故事表現得明瞭了，觀衆旣感到平凡；把故事弄得過於離奇，觀衆們又感到奇特，而不合理。所以，偵探片的導演，第一應該有極精密的科學頭腦，第二應該富有暗示手法，因爲這樣纔能不使影片過理想化，同時也可以使影片不致於平凡，「玫瑰别墅」的導演，是没有做到這二點的。</p>
<p>本來，偵探影片，首先就要合理，他的所以使人們因驚奇而感到興趣的完全爲了在事實的眞相之上，有某種東西遮蔽着。所以高明的偵探家，一定第一套手續，就是把這些遮蔽的東西劈開，那末，偵探影片的製作者，無疑的也應該一步步的把不相干的疑陣壁開，終於使眞相大白，而觀衆也因爲一步步的接近故事的中心，而一步步的緊張起來。</p>
<p>同時，偵探家的所以能夠破案，不外根據一些線索，所以偵探片的製作者應該隨處有暗示的方法，表現一些線索，這樣，主角自然可以破案，而不會不合理，敏感的觀衆也會因了這線索而推測，假使事有出乎意料之外，而還是合理的，那觀衆一定更嘆爲觀止了。所以「玫瑰别墅」的缺點，是一般偵探片中應該注意的地方！</p>

<h3>西席地密爾談　怎樣選擇新進人才</h3>
<p>— 黃影呆</p>
<p>新進的明星，我們用怎樣的方法去選擇他們，這的確是一個有研究價值的問題。大導演西席地密爾，祇須一幣之下，便可選拔他們。現在他仍舊用這種方法。他用一種實地試騐的方法，使演員一試，或拍攝一卷影片，但在這影片中，祗須一刹那間，他便可决定去捨了</p>
<p>他過去的發現都根據於一瞥眼間。他在史璜遜未做他演員之前，也祇有一次在一齣表演沐浴的喜劇中，看見了她在銀幕上。亦祇在一瞥之間他看見了一個黑瘦的女子，靠在門口。「她的身段，她靠在門口的姿態，我已深信這女子有充足的能力」西席地密爾說，「在她没有工作之前，我便尋出了她的名字，喊她來看我。」這樣史璜遜的銀幕工作開始了。</p>
<p>琵琵黛妮兒也是另外的一個，由西席地密爾一瞥之下而選定的。那時，有一天，她拍攝一張兩卷長的趣劇，羅克導演的，西席地密爾走到攝影塲上去，祗看了八尺長的片子，琵琵黛妮兒在表演他便一力提拔她，帮助她，琵琵黛妮兒以後在銀幕上的成功，就在這時候開始的。</p>
<p>這是西席地密爾的主見，他從來不喜歡演員去訪他。他說：「個人訪問時的印像，不能作選擇演員的凖標。他們在銀幕上與銀幕下，一切的一切，每有絶端的不同。在一張影片，或一度實地試騐中，我們可以看見他們的個性是如何，印象是如何。我相信開麥拉的忠信，來作取捨的標凖，結果是没有一次受到欺騙的。」</p>
<p>然而他的選拔演員的條件。但關於亞麗絲德萊，却是例外了。幾年之前，她在西席地密爾的剪片室中工作。這間剪片室和他的辦公室離得很近，每次他從辦公室到剪片室中，看看這個年青的美人，在怱忙的工作。他從不想使她到銀幕上去。直到有一天，一個演員，在半中的時期走開了，她祇拍一小部分，他馬上要找個人來替代，否則要耗費許多光隂。他派一個人到剪片室裏去，調她來代替。在這短片中，她的表演很好，這樣一來，她便永久不回剪片室去了西席地密爾用這種方法，選擇演員，似乎太不審愼吧？但他從來没有受過騙。</p>

<h3>電影小說爲國爭光（四）</h3>
<p>— 謝月笙</p>
<p>隆…隆…隆…拍…拍…拍…這一陣熱烈的砲聲，把一二八的大戰爆炸了。敵兵似潮水般的湧進中國來。我們土地，保障，生命，財産，妻子，愛人，父母，子女，給他們侵佔的侵佔，屠殺的屠殺了。一陣悲慘的戰聲，喚醒了天雄的愛情迷夢。他毅然地召集了愛國的同志籌備着救國工作。</p>
<p>爲着國家爭光而戰！爲了民族生存而戰！在隆隆地砲火聲裏，天雄，紅玉，率領着熱血健兒，向着車站出發了。聰明的雪芳，專誠做了一個一爲國爭光的徽章，贈給天雄，祝頌他們努力殺敵，爲國爭光。</p>
<p>殺…殺…殺…天雄指揮着健兒，加入前線拚命地殺敝。他們這樣地在戰壕裏，殺了半個多月，勇敢的天雄，因爲奮勇殺敵而受傷了。</p>
<p>雪芳得到了天雄受傷的消息，立刻趕到醫院裏來探視。她很小心地親來看護，不上幾天，天雄的傷勢全愈了。她由欽佩而起了敬愛。</p>
<p>「我們得了你受傷的消息眞急死了，」她扶着微跛的天雄，蹣跚地走到一條石糧旁邊，很誠懇地說。</p>
<p>「謝謝你，可是爲了國家就是一死也是應當的」天雄微笑着回答說，他們彼此感到一種内心的愉快。</p>
<p>中華民國的國民，人人都應該似天雄這樣。蘇容帶着督促地勉勵自已。他覺得雪芳和天雄倆的愛苗，是從天雄奮鬥愛國中收穫來的。他聽見雪芳和天雄說的把紅玉介給他的話，正和侮辱他一般，頓時感到一陣慚愧。他决定了去參加抗敵的工作了。</p>
<p>戰事的區域逐漸擴大了。天神般的大刀隊，奮勇地向敵軍進攻。蘇容指揮着健兒，殺得敵軍跪地求命。我軍繼續地佔領了敵軍陣綫，終於達到最後的勝利。</p>
<p>停戰恊定把戰爭告一斷落。蘇容陣亡的消息傳到後方來，給於國民一種鼓勵振刷愛國的精神，和值得人們欽佩敬仰的同情。這消息又其使紅玉和雪芳倆威到鼻酸流涕。</p>
<p>一輪剩殘的夕陽，倒掛在西天一角，已消失了它固有的强烈了。噹…噹…噹的晚鐘聲，從古塔裏送了出來，含着慘楚而悲哀的餘音。</p>
<p>嶄新的烈士忠魂碑前，站着一對青年伉儷，和一個素衣少女，在憑弔這位已故烈士的忠魂，從寂靜的墓碑裏，隂約地傳出來一陣…長期抵抗…收復失地的聲音（完）</p>

<h3>Zhejiang Troops Adopting an Attitude of Treating Fujian as a Vassal; The Central Government Orders All Zhejiang Divisions to Concentrate in the Border Area Within a Specified Time; All Aircraft of the Aviation Administration Prepared and Awaiting Orders to Depart; Major Naval Vessels on Alert in the Coastal Areas of Fujian and Zhejiang; The Central Government Prepares to Blockade the Fujian Sea Approaches at an Appropriate Time</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) According to information from the Aviation Administration's Beijing office, following the outbreak of the Fujian Incident, the Administration immediately received orders to, in addition to dispatching reconnaissance aircraft to the Zhejiang-Fujian border daily, make preparations to its entire fleet of aircraft and await orders to depart. Currently, the aircraft donated by the Administration and various sectors are sufficient for the emergency. The Third and Fourth Squadrons, as well as the Bomber Squadron, which are currently in Jiangxi responsible for suppressing bandits, will not be transferred. The Central Government has ordered all Zhejiang divisions to mobilize and concentrate within a specified time [text missing], adopting an attitude of surveillance towards Fujian. The Central Air Force will also dispatch teams to garrison two locations and has ordered the local governments to expedite the construction of airfields for their use. (Special dispatch, 28th)</p>
<h3>All Documents to be Stopped from Being Sent to Fujian</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Following the outbreak of the Fujian Incident, in addition to ordering the army, navy, and air force to launch separate offensives, and rigorously enforcing economic blockade, the Central Government has ordered that all documents being sent from the Central Government to Fujian be stopped. (Special dispatch, 28th)</p>
<h3>Central Government Announcement to Overseas Compatriots</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) After the Fujian Incident, overseas compatriots have sent numerous telegrams to the Central Government, requesting the government to severely punish the rebellious party and swiftly quell the rebellion to assuage the anger of the overseas Chinese. The Central Propaganda Department has drafted an announcement to overseas compatriots. The general content is similar to the announcement to compatriots nationwide, but emphasizes arousing the patriotic, party-loving, province-loving, and hometown-loving zeal of overseas compatriots, maintaining the glorious history of the revolution, and unanimously condemning the rebels. (Central News Agency dispatch, 28th)</p>
<h3>The Central Government Will Send a Note to Friendly Nations</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) An official from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that, in handling the Fujian Incident, besides having dispatched troops to defend against it, the Central Government will also send notes to friendly nations stating that the Chinese government will not recognize any loans or agreements made with the Fujian puppet organization. At an appropriate time, the Navy will completely blockade all sea ports of Fujian Province. Simultaneously, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will notify all countries according to international law to cease all direct relations with Fujian Province on any matter and cut off all maritime supplies. (Special dispatch, 28th)</p>
<h3>Chen Shaokuan Denies Upcoming Inspection Tour</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Naval Chief Chen Shaokuan stated that more than ten major warships of the Navy have successively departed from Shanghai and are being deployed on alert in the coastal areas of Fujian and Zhejiang. Torpedo Guerrilla Fleet Commander Wang Shouting also departed yesterday aboard a warship to patrol the waters near Sanduao. Training Fleet Commander Chen Xunyong is currently under orders to anchor his fleet outside Wusongkou and await orders. First Fleet Commander Chen Jiliang is temporarily remaining in Shanghai due to the importance of Shanghai's coastal defense, but will depart with his fleet if necessary. Rumors that Chen Shaokuan himself will be departing on an inspection tour are not true. Chen continued, stating that the maritime situation in Fujian is currently calm. The deployment of naval vessels under orders is simply a contingency measure. After the Navy's installations in Mawei were forcibly occupied by the Fujian side, the losses amount to three million yuan. The Jingxing, Qingyun, and Haiou warships are indeed being held in Mawei and have not yet escaped danger. Mawei Naval Port Commander Li Mengbin is temporarily stationed in Sanduao and awaiting orders, however, this location is very close to Fuzhou and the Fujian side is sending aircraft to reconnoiter the situation daily, creating a tense situation. Resistance will be mounted when necessary. The Navy's installations in Xiamen, including the Naval Port Command and four or five other offices, are still operating as usual and reporting the situation by telegram. A decision regarding a move southward will depend on the circumstances. (Special dispatch, 28th)</p>

<p>(Beiping) Lu Diping and Liu Xiang recently telegraphed He Yingqin and others, saying that the national crisis is as thin as a thread, and there is no time to offer assistance. However, a group of rabble has dared to incite chaos in Fujian. The rebel party is traitorous and unpatriotic. We are loyal and diligent and uphold discipline. We swear to exert all our efforts to eliminate the chaos and evil. (Central News Agency dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>(Hankou) The Wuhan Municipal Anti-Rebellion Mass Meeting will be held on the 30th. Cao Haosen, He Chengjun, and Zhang Qun are invited to be the chairmen. (Special dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>(Hankou) The Hankou Citizens' Anti-Rebellion Assembly will convene on the 4th at the New Market. The Pinghan Railway Workers' Union has telegraphed all railway workers to be the backbone of the government in suppressing the rebellion. Railways in Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo, Jiaoji, Xiang-E and other areas have replied by telegram to take unified action. (Special dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Overseas compatriots have continuously telegraphed the Central Government in recent days, requesting the prompt issuance of a clear order to suppress the Fujian rebels. The Central Government received more telegrams on the 18th. (1) The Siam General Branch and overseas Chinese organizations telegraphed, saying that Li, Cai, and other rebels harbor evil intentions, destroying the party and the country. Please issue a clear order to suppress them in order to uphold the law of the country. (2) Ye Feng, representative of the general branches in South Africa, India, Siam, French Annam, etc., telegraphed, saying that Chen, Li, and other rebels are accommodating communists and colluding with Japan, and that the rebel party is betraying the country and organizing a puppet government in Fujian to ruin the nation's vitality. Their crimes are heinous and they should be punished by issuing a clear order to suppress them in order to eliminate the evil, etc. (Central News Agency dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>(Hangzhou) Liu Heding, Zhang Luanji, and Zhou Zhiqun telegraphed Chairman Chiang on the 26th from Jianning, Fujian, and sent a telegram to the entire country, vehemently condemning Chen Mingshu and others for betraying the party and the country. They also requested an early attack, regardless of the benefits to the party and the country. We who live near the rebel party are indignant and willing to be the vanguard to eliminate them like a morning meal. Zhejiang and Shandong received the telegram and have replied, expressing their deep appreciation. (Central News Agency dispatch, 28th)</p>
<h3>Ye Chucang's Speech; Hoping Fujianese Quickly Quell the Rebellion</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Ye Chucang gave a speech on the 27th at the Capital's Anti-Rebellion Expanded Commemorative Week, saying that the Fujian Incident is not a local incident, but only a few rebel parties are creating chaos there. Its content is complicated and will not succeed. It will inevitably be eliminated in the shortest possible time, which is undoubted. These rebel parties, according to the national will of Fujian and the social forces, will not be allowed to exist for long. A few years ago, the Communist Party disturbed Guangzhou, killing and setting fires. In less than two days, an extraordinary force unknowingly emerged in Guangzhou, eliminating the Communist Party. This is the healthy force of society. The healthy force of society in Jiangxi is not as strong as Guangzhou, so the Communist Party occupied it for many years. The healthy force of society in Fujian is no less than Guangzhou. It is not easy for these rebel parties to create chaos there. I hope that Fujian compatriots will eliminate this rebel party as soon as possible. Currently, newspapers across the country are verbally attacking and strongly condemning the Fujian Incident, which shows that the people of the country have recognized the Central Government's policy of suppressing bandits and resisting Japan, and expressed their sympathy. It will definitely have the strength to eliminate the Fujian rebellion, but we must not be lazy and relax. We cannot let the Fujian Incident affect our work. Chairman Chiang said, "Although there is a rebellion in Fujian, we must continue to suppress bandits and never relax our bandit suppression because of the Fujian rebellion," which is the reason why, etc. (Central News Agency dispatch, 28th)</p>

Around the time the U.S. Asiatic Fleet arrived in Xiamen, 12 American soldiers landed. It is also heard that recently, the United Kingdom, the United States, and France are said to be selling a large number of aircraft to the new government. (Dentsu dispatch, 28th)</p>

Yang concluded that the suppression of the Red Army in Southern Jiangxi will not be affected. Yang met with Chiang. After the results are available, he will return to Guangdong to report back.

<h3>He Jian Returns to Hunan; Reports the Truth About the Fujian Incident</h3>
<p>(Changsha) He Jian went to Guangdong on the 21st to consult with Chen Jitang on important matters. He returned to the province on the evening of the 26th. On the 27th, he attended an expanded memorial week at the Zhongshan Hall and reported that the last time the ten bandits under Peng Dehuai entered Fujian, Cai Tingkai's troops were surrounded and unable to hold out. Chen Mingshu reached an agreement with the Communist Party's puppet central party headquarters in Shanghai, which was then forwarded to the Third International, and a military agreement was established. The condition was that Peng Dehuai would withdraw his troops and relieve the siege of Cai. Fujian would provide salt and cloth to the Communist Party. Therefore, important Communist Party figures such as Peng Zexiang and Zhang Bojun participated in this incident. Chen Mingshu also lobbied pro-Japanese people and reached an agreement with the Governor of Taiwan, and received a subsidy of three million yuan from the Communist Party. The Japanese are prolonging China's internal strife to permanently occupy the Northeast provinces. Chen in Guangdong, under the support of the Central Government, will absolutely cooperate with Hunan to suppress the bandits. Li Bai in Guangxi has always stood on the side of eliminating the Communist Party and is absolutely consistent. Li Jishen was not aware of the situation beforehand when he went to Fujian. Many within the 19th Route Army are also unwilling to sacrifice the glorious history of resisting Japan and suppressing bandits in the past, and do things that betray the party and the country by uniting with the Communists and Japan. The internal situation will collapse. He expected that at present, not only would no provinces respond, but the elements participating in the Fujian Incident would also change, and it would not expand.

<h3>Wang States He Has No Intention of Going to Jiangxi</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) President Wang told a reporter from the Central News Agency on the morning of the 28th that the news report that I was going to Jiangxi to meet Chairman Chiang was purely a misreport. Recently, I have no intention of going to Jiangxi. At the Central Plenary Session to be held in Nanjing next month, the Central Committee comrades are extremely eager for the Central Committee members in the Southwest to travel to Nanjing together to participate and discuss the countermeasures to deal with the national crisis. After the Fujian Incident, the Central Government had a proposal to send people to Guangdong, Hong Kong, and other places to consult with the Central Committee members residing in those places on various important policies. However, the selection of candidates is currently under consideration and a decision should be made within a few days. (Central News Agency dispatch, 28th)</p>

<h3>Current Commentary: The Obligatory Service System for the People of Shanxi Province</h3>
<p>The authorities in Shanxi Province recently formulated regulations for obligatory service for the people, issuing an order to all counties to comply with them. We have taken it and reviewed it, and we cannot help but express our opinions. We dare to offer our humble views for consideration.</p>
<p>First, we would like to ask the Shanxi authorities what their motivation is in formulating these regulations. As indicated in the opening remarks of the regulations, it is to enhance social honor and develop public undertakings. These two issues fall within the scope of construction, and it is justifiable for the authorities to devote their full efforts to promoting them. However, whether the promotion of construction undertakings must rely on the obligatory service of the people is still a major question. In terms of duties, there are government offices specializing in this matter. In terms of funds, there are specially designated expenses. In terms of labor, there are existing artisans. Assistance is often given by unemployed vagrants. Why is it necessary to force the people of the entire province to abandon their original occupations and engage in unfamiliar construction work for obligatory service? Moreover, driving citizens who lack experience to build roads and plant trees, how can they achieve development effectiveness? Fearing the current dogmas, they may gather in groups and think of moving away. How can they achieve social prosperity?</p>
<p>Second, the regulations stipulate that the people required to perform service are limited to men between the ages of 18 and 49. However, active military personnel, civil servants, teachers, and students are exempted. Besides these, regardless of whether they are employed laborers or vagrant elements, almost all are included. Although the service period is only thirteen days each year, people with jobs will still find it difficult to cope. During these thirteen days, will they allow their original jobs to be suspended, or will they find other remedies? People in the middle class and above can afford to provide their own meals during the service period, but those who rely on a day's labor to feed their families will feel insufficient if they are without wages for thirteen consecutive days. It is difficult to endure and unreasonable to force them to do public service with an empty stomach. Have the authorities taken this into account? As for civil servants, they should be models of rigorous implementation. Soldiers have long been used for road building with achievements in other provinces. Now that they are all excluded, how will they convince the people of the entire province?</p>
<p>The above two points only address the difficulties in implementation. If we argue from the opposite side, the malpractices will be far-reaching and the harm will be even greater. For example, the allocation of local work and the proof of exemption from service due to illness will give officials opportunities to manipulate things. Affluent families, fearing service, will inevitably have people stand in for them. This will allow those who are fond of trouble to use it as a means of blackmail. Therefore, after this measure is implemented, there may be no lack of criticism in the local area.</p>
<p>We humbly believe that there is a kind of obligation that the people should be forced to perform today. The meaning lies in forging physical fitness. Although it does not promote construction, it lays the foundation for all construction. The Chinese people have never placed importance on physical fitness. The title of "sick man" has long been a source of rebuke in the world. At a time when national crisis is imminent, we feel all the more ashamed of our weak bodies. Forced training is therefore necessary. However, at the beginning of implementation, we should plan for comprehensive measures, based on the principle of not conflicting with individual occupations, and on the premise of not harming the lives of ordinary people. Moreover, all levels should be consistent, with no exceptions, to create a trend of the times. While curbing objections based on the excuse of illness, we should also widely inform and explain in detail, so that the people understand the necessity of physical fitness and the importance of training, and that the authorities have no other intention. Only then will more people follow and the effectiveness will be widely expanded. The origin of saving the country lies in this. The increase in the spiritual strength of all construction is also in this. Compared to taking obligatory service as a banner, is this not a more significant path?</p>

<h3>Advice from Overseas Chinese Who Have Returned to the Country to the Officers and Soldiers of the 19th Route Army</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Association of Overseas Chinese Expelled Who Returned to the Country and Stayed in Beijing sent an express telegram for the Fujian Incident. The original text reads, "Chen Mingshu, Li Jishen, and other rebels have seized Fujian, suddenly raised a false banner, betrayed the party and the country, destroyed the law and disrupted discipline. They have also colluded with the Red bandits and the Japanese warlords, raised meaningless slogans, and destroyed social organizations, selling the country and harming the people. Their crimes are unforgivable. At a time when the national crisis is severe and the bandit scourge has not been eliminated, it is proper for all levels to be united and to defend against foreign insults. However, Chen and other rebels are hurting their hearts, acting perversely, and reversing the trend. The shocking news has spread and aroused anger in the masses. We urge the central government to severely punish them and publicly execute them. However, the officers and soldiers of our 19th Route Army have repeatedly achieved extraordinary results in the Northern Expedition, the anti-rebellion campaign, and the anti-Japanese wars in Shanghai. They have always had the reputation of being an iron army. They have been loyal to the party and the country and have brought glory to our nation. Their historical records are brilliant and worthy of cherishing. We hope that you will not be bewitched by a few troublemakers, lest you ruin your reputation and plunge the country into eternal destruction. The more we love you, the more we expect from you. We offer our sincere advice and hope that you will rein in at the edge of the precipice, and immediately distinguish between obedience and rebellion. We also hope that compatriots at home and abroad will unite to support the central government and quell the rebellion to save the country. This is a one-time event. In the face of the telegram, we cannot help but be terrified and angry. The Association of Overseas Chinese Expelled Who Returned to the Country and Stayed in Beijing bows in apology."

<h3>Shanxi Generals Express Unwillingness to Participate in Civil War; Ji Liang Arrives in Beijing from Shanxi</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Ji Liang, a Shanxi-born member of the Central Committee, arrived in Beijing from Shanxi on the morning of the 28th. According to him, since the September 18th Incident, Yan has believed that it is extremely important to unite due to the severity of the national crisis. Therefore, he is unwilling to hear about any political changes from the outside. Regarding the current Fujian Incident, the generals in Shanxi have expressed their intention to devote their full efforts to the internal construction of Shanxi and not participate in any civil war. The rumor that Feng Yuxiang came to Shanxi in disguise to discuss the Fujian Incident with Yan is untrue. He came here to participate in the Fourth Plenary Session of the Central Committee and has no other mission. As for whether Yan will come to Beijing to attend the plenary session, it is unknown.

<h3>Feng Yuxiang Expresses in Mount Tai that He Will Not Engage in Political Activities; Claims to Have No Contact with Fujian</h3>
<p>(Jinan) Feng Yuxiang, who is now in Mount Tai, sent his secretary, Chen, to tell reporters that he is reading books in the mountains, and not only is he not engaged in political activities, but he also never talks about them. Yesterday's banquet for local people proved that he has not left Mount Tai because he has nowhere to go and no way to avoid people's attention. Regarding the current situation, he believes that the opinions of the masses are the true opinions and must be respected. To save the country and survive, there is no contact with Fujian, and no one has come. The report that there is a Feng in Fujian is because it was not officially announced by Fujian, so it has not been corrected. He does not know Yu Xinqing either. However, Feng will express his sympathy to those who truly resist Japan. He has not telegraphed Beijing to inquire about the measures to deal with Fujian, and no one has talked about any titles. He is now ill and lives in the Sanyang Guan. Feng's guards are guarding the station and repairing the road up the mountain. Feng gives a lecture every week, encouraging them to resist Japan.

<h3>Qing and Red Gangs Fight for Docks at Lianyungang, Longhai Railway, Railway Brigade Mediation Ineffective</h3>

<p>(Tokyo) In order to avoid the crisis between Japan and the United States in 1935, Foreign Minister Hirota held a Japan-America informal meeting at his official residence at 7:30 PM on the 27th. On the Japanese side, Foreign Minister Hirota, Vice Minister Shigemitsu, Director of the European and American Affairs Bureau Togo, Director of the Information Bureau Amau, and Chief of the First Section of the Asian Affairs Bureau Morishima attended. On the American side, Ambassador Grew, Counselor Nibel, and four correspondents stationed in Beijing attended. Foreign Minister Hirota first proposed that the relationship between Japan and the United States is full of dangerous air, and the following issues should be resolved first in order to hope that the air will be eased: (1) Expanding and strengthening the Pacific Defense Restriction Agreement; (2) In order to remove the uneasiness of the two peoples and enhance friendly relations, the two countries should exchange goodwill envoys and determine effective measures to achieve this goal; (3) The issue of the Japan-US naval arms race. Then, each person freely expressed their opinions as much as possible, but the content was strictly kept secret and could not be ascertained. (United News Agency dispatch on the 28th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japan-America official-private informal meeting initiated by Foreign Minister Hirota was held at the Foreign Minister's official residence at 7:00 PM yesterday. On the American side, Ambassador Grew, Counselor Levinoel, New York Times correspondent Bayes, Mainichi Shimbun Far East Manager Vian, Asahi Shimbun correspondent Babb, and Japan Edward Company President Fliesh attended. On the Japanese side, Foreign Minister Hirota, Vice Minister Shigemitsu, Ambassador Yoshida, Director of the Information Bureau Amau, Vice Chairman of the Japan-America Association Count Kabayama, and others attended. After dinner, Foreign Minister Hirota gave a speech. Opinions were exchanged on issues such as the prevention of the naval arms race, immigration issues, the Manchuria-China issue, and others. At the meeting, the American side explained its position on the naval construction plan as follows: The expansion of the American navy is a traditional policy, only to protect commerce. If it is said that the Second Washington Naval Treaty in 1935 will jointly pressure Japan with the United Kingdom, it is a misunderstanding of the Japanese view. Even if the United States agrees to the Japanese slogan of equality in naval construction ratios, whether Japan must have the same naval power as the United Kingdom and the United States for its national defense is difficult to understand in this regard. (Dentsu dispatch on the 28th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Foreign Minister Hirota entered the palace at 2:00 PM today to pay his respects to the Emperor and report on the issues of Japan-India trade, the resumption of diplomatic relations between the United States and Russia, and the Fujian issue, as well as the recent situation in China and other various diplomatic issues. He left after about one hour and twenty minutes. (Dentsu dispatch on the 28th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Tokyo Newspaper reported an American telegram stating that, due to Ambassador Debuchi's return home, the Japanese Foreign Ministry will replace the ambassador to the United States. American newspapers predict that the new ambassador will be Viscount Kikujiro Ishii because Ishii has a very good private relationship with Roosevelt, and both Japan and the United States need a new diplomatic outlet to maintain peace between Japan and the United States. After the resumption of diplomatic relations between the United States and Russia, this atmosphere is even stronger. If Ishii is sent to the United States, the United States and Japan will seek a way out through an arbitration treaty. However, the attitude of the Japanese army and navy and the feelings of Americans towards Japan after the September 18th Incident have not yet recovered, and the result is still difficult to expect.

<h3>Sugimura's Southward Advancement Theory: Destroying the Power of Overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia</h3>
<p>Osaka Consul General Sugimura Yotaro arrived in Kobe this morning at 7:30 AM aboard the Fusang Maru from Taiwan. At 1:30 PM, he took the Tsubame Limited Express to Tokyo. He told reporters that relations between China and Japan are gradually becoming satisfactory. After inspecting Taiwan, he feels that South China and Southeast Asia are important areas for the development of the Japanese nation. Taiwan is Japan's base for southward advancement. If Japan actively advances into Southeast Asia, the power of overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia will soon disappear. Therefore, the mandated islands in Southeast Asia must be maintained with national strength. (Hualian dispatch on the 28th)</p>
<h3>French Senator Presents Report on Visit to Russia: Praises the Perfect Organization of the Red Army and the Progress of Military Technology</h3>
<p>(Paris) Mr. Salin, a French senator who accompanied Herriot on a visit to the Soviet Union, has now reported on the trip to the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Senate. His report has been printed into a pamphlet. In his report, Mr. Salin pointed out the achievements of Soviet agriculture and especially emphasized the progress of collective farms and their increasingly prosperous situation. He made complimentary comments on the several factories and the vast development of electrification and aviation he saw in Moscow and Ukraine, as well as the complete disappearance of unemployment. When the report mentioned the attitude of the people, it especially emphasized the enthusiasm of the masses for creation, their loyalty to the Soviet government and the Communist Party, and the significant increase in national happiness compared to pre-revolutionary standards. The report finally detailed the organization of the Red Army, its modern technical equipment, and its high combat effectiveness. In conclusion, Mr. Salin discussed the establishment of normal diplomatic relations between the United States and the Soviet Union as clear evidence of the Soviet Union's increased international importance and advocated that France should develop and consolidate friendly relations with the Soviet Union. Subsequently, Senator Berenger, representing the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Senate, thanked Mr. Salin for his important and unbiased report. (TASS dispatch on the 25th)</p>

<h3>Young Chinese Man Walks Around the World: Arrives in London via Tibet, India, and Persia</h3>
<p>(London) A young Chinese man named Mr. Peng, 21 years old, from Henan Province, recently arrived in London today after walking through Tibet, India, Persia, and other places over a period of three years. Mr. Peng's source of income comes partly from the assistance of friends and partly from working along the way. The photo album he carries is full of small photos of famous people he has met along the way. When he set off, several other young Chinese men accompanied him, but they all left along the way, so only Mr. Peng was left when he arrived in the British capital. He now wants to travel to Ireland and Scotland before returning home via the Americas. (Reuters dispatch on the 27th)</p>

<h3>Amidst the Increasingly Urgent International Situation, Major Powers Plan for National Mobilization, Learning from the Lack of Preparation During World War I, They Have Been Working Tirelessly for More Than a Decade</h3>
<p>The World News Agency reports that modern warfare is not just the mobilization of the army and navy, but a "war of national strength" involving all the facilities of national society. Since World War I, the major powers have been working hard for more than a decade to plan for national mobilization. The following is an outline of the content of the investigation for reference:</p>
<h3>France</h3>
<p>(A) The organization is divided into central and local agencies.</p>
<h3>Central Organs</h3>
<p>Central organs serve as the supreme advisory body for national mobilization. In 1921, a High National Defense Council was established, with the Prime Minister as Chairman and the Ministers of Foreign Affairs, Interior, Finance, Army, Navy, Public Works, and Colonies as members. Under this council were two subordinate bodies: (1) a Research Committee, composed of vice ministers from relevant ministries and representatives from each ministry, tasked with reviewing issues discussed by the High National Defense Council; and (2) a Permanent Secretariat, directly under the Cabinet, tasked with selecting issues, collecting discussion materials, and drafting proposals for submission to the aforementioned Research Committee. In addition, each ministry had subordinate organs of the High National Defense Council, each serving in the preparation of total mobilization.</p>
<h3>Local Organs</h3>
<p>Army districts, industrial mobilization districts, and local administrative districts were governed by general mobilization districts, harmonizing the three major elements of military affairs, economy, and administration. Various necessary organs were established under these general mobilization districts.</p>
<p>(B) Legislation</p>
<h3>National General Mobilization Bill</h3>
<p>This bill, the foundation for national general mobilization, was approved by both houses of parliament in 1928, but has yet to be promulgated. It stipulates that French citizens, regardless of age or gender, are obligated to participate directly or indirectly in national defense efforts during wartime. The government has the authority to forcibly acquire resources when needed. For the purpose of preparing for and implementing mobilization, and to undertake measures concerning central and local economic organization, to meet the needs of the military, and to supply essential goods for the livelihood of the people, the government has the authority to engage in extensive economic controls.</p>
<p>(C) Procedures for Preparatory Measures</p>
<h3>Setting of General Mobilization Plans</h3>
<p>In addition to the obvious Army and Navy departments, other relevant ministries each create necessary and concrete general mobilization plans regarding industry, transportation, finance, banking, food, resources, etc., which are filed with the aforementioned Permanent Secretariat. After discussion by the Research Committee, they are submitted to the Supreme National Defense Council.</p>
<h3>Outline of Facilities</h3>
<p>(1) Education of government officials and reserve officers in general mobilization duties; (2) Military Supplies Industry Advisory Committee, established within the Army Department, composed of military officers, government officials, business leaders, technicians, and knowledgeable individuals from the private sector, to create plans for wartime factory conversion, factory production resource allocation, and expansion; (3) Establishment of industrial mobilization districts, currently divided into thirteen districts nationwide, with the commander of the army district serving as the district commander, responsible for preparing concrete industrial mobilization plans; (4) Preparation of raw materials: advance preparations for wartime supply of necessary raw materials for military supplies, especially those with insufficient domestic production; (5) Preparation of fuel: the National Fuel Bureau was established in 1929, adopting a fuel import permit system and stipulating mandatory storage obligations to increase domestic fuel reserves. It also protected and encouraged the development of fuel resources and research on alternative fuels, while promoting conservation of consumption. Especially for liquid fuels, a national fuel system was established, mandating the mixed use of gasoline and alcohol and employing other methods to ensure the supply of fuel resources; (6) Preparation of food: considering the supply of food during wartime, especially the production of fertilizers, preparations are underway, as fertilizer is one of the basic raw materials in rural areas and also a raw material for gunpowder; (7) Factory mobilization preparation: factories manufacturing military supplies each create mobilization plans, preparing for factory conversion, machinery replenishment and delivery, and staffing.

<h3>French Military Installations in the Pacific: Plans to Establish Naval and Air Bases; New Harbor Can Accommodate Large Ships; Fortifications to Be Built Along the Coast</h3>
<p>(London) According to a correspondent for the Brisbane Daily Review, the French are studying procedures for constructing seaplane and submarine bases in French territories in the Pacific. Plans are being prepared for a new harbor capable of accommodating large battleships. Fortifications will also be built along the coast. Japanese ships are reportedly frequently surveying terrain in remote locations in the Pacific. It is noted that the French are not bound by the 1930 London Naval Treaty, which prohibits the United States, Great Britain and Japan from increasing fortifications in the Pacific. (Reuters, 28th)</p>
<p>(London) A correspondent for the London Guide in Brisbane reports that several Australian merchants have recently returned to Australia from various Pacific islands. They claim that France is building naval and air bases on various islands within the New Caledonia archipelago in the Pacific, protected by strong fortifications. Similar war preparations are underway on other isolated French islands in the Pacific. In the opinion of the newspaper, France's sudden action is likely due to Japan's recent activities in the Pacific and rumors of an impending German-Japanese alliance. (National Telegram, 28th)</p>
<h3>Issue of Japanese Trusteeship of Pacific Islands: United States to Issue Important Statement</h3>
<p>(Washington) U.S. State Department officials are remaining completely silent regarding the notion that Japan's withdrawal from the League of Nations means it will no longer attempt to reclaim the mandated islands, only stating that a declaration will be issued at the appropriate time. The United States has never recognized Japan's mandate over these 1,600-plus small islands and, in theory, still demands a share. Therefore, there is much speculation in Washington as to whether the U.S. government will make demands when Japan finally withdraws from the League of Nations. State Department officials deeply believe that acquiescing to Japan's continued trusteeship or not is a policy issue concerning naval and political stability in the Pacific. These islands are militarily significant enough to control traffic between the United States and the Far East, so few believe that the Japanese will be willing to relinquish them. However, no one dares to predict how this matter will be resolved if Japan finally withdraws from the League of Nations. These islands are scattered across 100,000 square miles of ocean, with a total area of only 700 square miles, the largest being over 600, but they serve as Japan's first line of defense against eastern attacks. The islands have many natural harbors, suitable for submarines, torpedo boats, and destroyers, forming an encirclement around Guam, which the United States has promised not to fortify.

<h3>World's Deadliest Poison Gas: Ordinary Masks Ineffective; Manufacturing Plan in the Hands of the British Government</h3>
<p>(London) Lieutenant General Crozier stated in a speech here today that the British government possesses a plan for manufacturing the world's deadliest gas. A certain major power also has this plan. Scientists have not yet been able to develop a mask to resist this new gas. (National Telegram, 27th)</p>
<h3>Australia Intensifies National Defense: The Whole Nation Supports the National Defense Council; Government to Propose Increased Spending Bill</h3>
<p>Sydney News: In view of the future Pacific war, Australia is bound to be invaded by Japan, and Australians are now joining the Hughes-initiated Australian National Defense Council. Almost every town in Australia enthusiastically supports the Council, and newspapers unanimously report and promote it. Australia has been anxious about "Japanese invasion" for years, and its enthusiasm for the national defense movement has been greater than ever. Ostensibly, in order to maintain trade with Japan, there has been no public call for anti-Japanese sentiment. However, the leaders of the National Defense Council, who hold important positions in political, business, military, and naval circles, are warning that "Australia will fall into war." Australia's national defense is extremely weak, with only four cruisers in the navy (two in reserve), six destroyers, two naval ports, and a total of 3,000 personnel. There are no battleships or submarines. The army has 27,000 officers and soldiers, and the air force has only 28 aircraft. It is expected that the Federal Government will request an additional five million gold dollars in the next budget to supplement national defense. (World Press)</p>
<h3>Japanese Air Force Conducts Attack and Defense Drills</h3>
<p>Osaka: The Japanese Army is intensifying training in aerial tactics. The Akeno Flying School and the Hamamatsu Air Regiment began aerial attack and defense exercises today. This morning at 5:00 AM, five Type 88 bombers flew from Hamamatsu to Akeno for aerial bombing exercises. The Akeno Air Force fighter planes intercepted and ground troops fired with anti-aircraft guns, ceasing at 7:00 AM. It is reported that this exercise will continue until the 30th.

<h3>Cuban Situation Clarified: Opposition Party Compromises with San Martin; Efforts of Uruguayan Envoy; New U.S. Ambassador to Take Office Next Month</h3>
<p>Havana: It is learned that the Cuban authorities, through the mediation of the Uruguayan envoy, have put aside their differences with the opposition factions, including the most powerful ABC group, and are working together to form a stable government. Although final approval is still a few days away, the parties have agreed to cease hostilities. According to the agreement, President San Martin must release all political prisoners and immediately elect representatives to a constitutional convention. (National Telegram, 27th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Former U.S. Ambassador to Cuba, Welles, took a train to Miami today and will fly back to Havana. Because some people in Cuba have threatened not to allow Welles to land in Havana, the travel arrangements are being kept secret. The new ambassador, Caffery, is expected to take office in mid-December. (National Telegram, 28th)</p>

<h3>British Parliament Discusses European Situation: Disarmament Debate Does Not Benefit Peace; Fundamental Plan to Revise Treaties; Baldwin Argues that Italy, France, and England Should Negotiate Directly with Germany</h3>
<p>(London) During today's session of the British Parliament, several members made important speeches concerning the European situation. Conservative member Walter-Wickham declared that the best policy today is to forget the debate on disarmament and attempt to eliminate the root of the problem. We must now undertake to revise the treaty, and Europe will never enjoy peace until this is done. The problems of the Polish Corridor, the Hungarian border, and the Saar region should be addressed. The British government should not ignore these matters, as if mentioning them would grant Germany a major diplomatic victory. In fact, we should first reach out to Germany and freely discuss the points that Germans feel harm their national honor. Former Prime Minister Baldwin then spoke on behalf of the government, saying that Great Britain does not believe that any country can be forced to remain permanently inferior in terms of armaments. Anyone familiar with history will recall that after the Battle of Jena, Prussia, though forced to limit its military power, had a strong and well-equipped army by the Battle of Leipzig. Germany has domestic problems such as unemployment that need to be resolved, so it needs peace. England, France, and Italy should work together to negotiate directly with Germany and seek a path to progress in this way. (National Telegram, 21st)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Amidst the clamor here for direct negotiations between Germany and France, another newspaper has published a very important essay that has attracted the attention of the general public. One is the Bavarian government's organ, the Bayerischer Kurier, which today published an article stating that various reports from France show that the people of France are willing to live peacefully with the people of Germany. However, obstacles that prevent the two countries from joining hands still exist. These obstacles do not arise from the intention of the French people, but from a very small number of politicians who benefit from disrupting the rapprochement between Berlin and Paris. The French people today, like the people of Germany, are tired of all the disputes of war. The French people do not want to see a recurrence of 1914 today. The borders of France already have strong armaments and fortresses to adequately protect them, and there is no reason to provoke Germany. The second essay appeared in the Freiheit newspaper, stating that the French and Poles are just as inclined to peace as the Germans. We now extend our hands to them so that we can walk the path of peace together. But we hope that you will not be incited by others to make things difficult for us. Do not believe the unscrupulous words of rascals, who are merely mercenaries of warmongers. But remember Hitler's words, war can create indescribable tragedies, and all nations of the world will suffer, and the small things we hope to gain are very small compared to the loss of life and property.

<h3>British Ships Transporting Narcotics from Persia to Manchuria: Labour Party Raises Questions; Simon Claims It Is False</h3>
<p>(London) Today, Labour Party member Davies raised questions in the House of Commons, saying that some British ships were loading opium from Persia to Manchuria, and the authorities of British ports and British territories that the ships passed through provided considerable facilitation. Foreign Minister Simon replied that Davies' questions were completely unfounded. The Sino-Japanese Committee of the League of Nations passed a communique to all governments stating that the provisions of the International Opium Convention should apply to the transportation of opium in Manchuria and Rehe. The Advisory Committee of the League of Nations also recommended that opium and all narcotics should not be transported to "Manchukuo" without satisfactory certification as specified in the 1925 Geneva Opium Convention, in order to avoid violating the provisions of the Convention. Foreign Minister Simon stated that British authorities and British territories will fulfill their international obligations and the responsibilities of the League of Nations recommendations. (Reuters, 27th)</p>
<h3>Motion of Censure Against the Government Rejected</h3>
<p>(London) The Labour Party's amendment to the address to the King, censuring the government for its mishandling of domestic and foreign affairs, was rejected today by a vote of 424 to 53. (Reuters, 27th)</p>
<h3>Report on British-Russian Trade Situation</h3>
<p>(London) Parliamentary Secretary to the Board of Trade Burghley stated in the House of Commons today that in the first nine months of 1933, Russian goods imported into England totaled 11,090,000 pounds, while British goods exported to Russia totaled 3,685,000 pounds. Conservative member Knox stated that if the Russian side sells us so many goods and we sell so few goods to Russia, then negotiations on the trade agreement between the two sides will require considerable time. (Reuters, 27th)</p>
<h3>League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol to Visit England</h3>
<p>(London) League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol recently went to Rome to attend the funeral of former Italian representative to the League of Nations Council, Schanzer. It is now heard that Avenol plans to come to London in early December for official reasons, taking the opportunity to meet with British authorities. It is also heard that Avenol's trip was decided before he went to Rome. (Havas, 27th)</p>
<h3>Time-Consuming and Wasteful: Where Is the Achievement of Disarmament? 920 Meetings Large and Small; Over One Million Swiss Francs Spent</h3>
<p>(London) Labour Party member McGovern asked in the House of Commons today about the number of meetings and expenses of the Disarmament Conference. Foreign Minister Simon replied that including the meetings of the subcommittees, there were a total of 920 meetings, including 18 plenary sessions, 81 meetings of the General Committee, and 54 meetings of the Steering Committee, costing a total of 1,124,000 Swiss francs, all allocated from the League of Nations budget. The League of Nations also paid Disarmament Conference Chairman Henderson 73,271 francs, not including the expenses of his secretary and banquets. (Reuters, 27th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The secretariat of the Disarmament Conference notified the various technical committees to continue their work, in order to show that the Disarmament Conference has not completely stopped. Therefore, two technical committees met in Geneva today, one for the Committee on Armaments and one for the Disarmament Supervision Committee. (Havas, 28th)</p>
<h3>Chautemps Cabinet of France Holds First Meeting; Mitigating Financial Plan to Avoid Repeating Failure; New Socialist Party Declares Refusal to Cooperate; It Is Expected That the New Cabinet's Life May Not Be Long</h3>
<p>(Paris) The Chautemps government held its first cabinet meeting this morning, deciding that the new cabinet will meet with the National Assembly on December 2, at which time it will discuss some financial proposals. The debate on the financial plan will begin on December 7. (Reuters, 28th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Political and market circles are pessimistic about the possibility of the new government lasting long. However, new Premier Chautemps hopes to delete the civil servant pay cut from the financial proposal in order to avoid failure, and intends to extract 100 million francs from tax evaders without reducing the special allowances of civil servants. It also plans to reduce income tax refunds, increase road transport donations, and continue lottery donations to increase revenue. The above proposals will begin debate on the 7th of next month. (Reuters, 27th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The new cabinet in France under the leadership of Chautemps, from the perspective of its current organization, is merely a reorganized product of the previous Sarraut cabinet, with only four of the eighteen internal ministers not listed in the previous Sarraut cabinet. Moreover, the majority that the new cabinet can control in parliament has become increasingly narrow, as the figures in the new cabinet are almost all extremists. At present, Chautemps can only rely on about 200 seats, and the rest depends on whether he can move the moderate parties to maintain neutrality. However, the so-called New Socialist Party, under the leadership of Renaudel, has expressed its refusal to cooperate with the new cabinet, as the party has adopted a new policy that is clearly different from the old Socialist Party. From this point of view, it is expected that the Chautemps cabinet will not last long. In addition, it is heard that former Prime Minister Herriot has declared his support for the new cabinet. He said that although he is physically unable to take on arduous tasks, he is willing to serve as a diplomatic supporter of the new government at the League of Nations or other countries when necessary. (National Telegram, 27th)</p>
<p>Former French Prime Minister Herriot arrived in this city from Paris at 5 pm, keeping his movements secret, and also refused to make a statement on the political situation. (Havas, 27th)</p>
<h3>Hungarian Prime Minister Arrives in Austrian Capital for Trade Agreement Negotiations</h3>

<h3>German Soldiers Who Died on the Austrian-German Border Given State Funeral; Hitler Attends in Person; Hindenburg Offers Wreath</h3>
<p>(Berlin) One German soldier who died on the Austrian-German border this month was given a state funeral this afternoon in the presence of Premier Hitler and Defense Minister General von Blomberg. Blomberg also placed a wreath on behalf of President Hindenburg. Hitler gave a speech at that time, calling the soldier a martyr for Germany. (Reuters, 27th)</p>
<h3>Turkey and Yugoslavia Sign Arbitration Treaty</h3>
<p>Belgrade: After the successive establishment of agreements between Turkey, Greece, Turkey, Romania, and Turkey and Yugoslavia, a treaty of friendship and arbitration between Yugoslavia and Turkey was signed today. The treaty stipulates that all disputes between the two countries will be resolved by peaceful means. At the same time, a permanent arbitration committee consisting of five people will be formed, with Turkey and Yugoslavia each sending one person, and the remaining three people filled by personnel from other neutral countries.

<h3>Roosevelt's Monetary Policy: Diverse Domestic Debates; Opposition Forces Increase; Authorities Proceed Slowly with Gold Experiment; Raising Huge Sums to Cope with Maturing National Debt</h3>
<p>(Washington) It is learned that the U.S. government will continue its current monetary policy. Although it has been attacked in recent weeks, the government does not intend to fight it hard, but wants to quietly observe the strength of the opposition to see the national reaction to the current policy and its criticisms. (National Telegram, 27th)</p>
<p>(New York) Former financial advisor to the U.S. delegation to the World Economic Conference, Warburg, today attacked President Roosevelt's monetary policy again, and advocated an Anglo-American monetary truce. Warburg sent a letter to Senator Borah urging him to abandon the deliberate depreciation of the dollar and the attempt to treat the dollar as a commodity, and said that it is only possible to work with the United Kingdom to re-establish the value of the dollar early based on the new gold bar standard. This matter concerns all countries using the pound, and the best way to achieve this goal is an Anglo-American monetary truce. Public meetings are being held across the country, speeches are being given, and letters are being distributed, with endless debates on whether to agree or disagree with President Roosevelt's monetary policy. The authorities are now proceeding slowly with their gold experiment and are eager to prepare to raise huge sums using ordinary methods to cope with the $727 million in national debt that is due on December 15. The New York Telegraph reported that the price of gold has not changed, indicating that the price of gold will remain unchanged while the government examines public opinion. It is expected that many bills on the restoration of silver coinage will be submitted to Congress early. At the same time, Senators Harrison, Thomas, and Smith are now studying a plan to set the price of silver at 75 cents per ounce and to use one ounce of silver and 25 cents of gold as a reserve for issuing silver certificates.

<h3>Achievement of American Recovery: Unemployment Reduced by Three Million; Roosevelt Signs Movie Industry Regulations</h3>
<p>(Washington) President Green of the American Federation of Labor claimed that in the six months ending at the end of September, unemployment was reduced by a total of 3,600,000. According to the American government, of the $3.3 billion in public works funding, $2.0049767 billion has been allocated for use. Soon tens of thousands of people will be able to get work because the government is using this money. This allocation averaged $136,651,139 per week over the past fifteen weeks. It is stated that the U.S. government made this announcement because outsiders had criticized the Public Works Administration for failing to make the same progress as the Recovery Administration and the Rural Rehabilitation Administration. (National Telegram, 27th)</p>
<p>President Roosevelt signed more than 20 recovery industry regulations today, including the film industry. (Reuters, 27th)</p>
<p>Administrator Johnson of the American Recovery Administration announced that the long-drafted film industry regulations have been signed by the President. The "excessive salaries" clause, which has been in dispute across the country, will be implemented later, pending further investigation and verification. Some people in the film industry enthusiastically agree with this clause, while others oppose it. The opposition believes that the industry regulations should only stipulate the minimum salary, and there is no need to limit the maximum salary. Supporters believe that after this implementation, events such as when actress Constance Bennett once received a salary of $30,000 per week will not happen again, because the salaries of Hollywood stars are often far more than the salary of the President of the United States, so some people think it should be restricted.

<h3>Deng Mingjie Discusses the Situation of Bandit Suppression in Sichuan | Hopes the Central Government will Provide Funds |</h3>
<p>Deng Mingjie, the representative of the Sichuan Pacification Commissioner stationed in Shanghai, went to Sichuan last month on official business. He passed through Hubei and Beijing and returned to Shanghai the night before last. Yesterday, the reporter interviewed Mr. Deng to inquire about the situation of bandit suppression in Sichuan. Mr. Deng said that around the 20th of last month, due to the ineffective operations of Yang Sen's troops, Yingqu and Liang counties were lost. Subsequently, Liu Cunhou's troops collapsed without a fight, and Suiding fell into the hands of the bandits. At that time, Sheng and Zhang indeed felt a momentary threat. Later, the 21st Army changed to the front line, and the situation changed. From then until now, after more than 20 battles of various sizes, the bandits gradually retreated, and casualties were also high. There are currently about 40,000 guns in the hands of the bandits in Sichuan, but this is not enough to be feared. Given time, they can certainly be eliminated. Commissioner Liu is now proceeding to gradually reduce the bandit area from the military aspect, seeking to completely resolve this group of bandits within the scope of the province and prevent them from disturbing neighboring provinces. However, he feels extremely difficult in raising military expenses and local post-war funds. It is well known that the burden on the people of Sichuan is heavy. At this time, if we seek other income in the province, it is bound to increase the burden on the people, and the people are really unable to bear it after this disaster. What's more, the bandits are using heresies to bewilder the people, and it is absolutely inappropriate to give them more excuses. Therefore, regarding this expense, we still cannot help but hope that the central government will find a way to provide sufficient relief. The bandit suppression in Sichuan is different from the situation in Jiangxi. In Jiangxi, most of the troops are transferred from other provinces, while in Sichuan, they are purely local troops. Sichuan has many mountainous areas, and the troops are well-trained in mountain climbing. The bandit cadres come from other provinces and lack this ability, so the bandits in Jiangxi can only rely on the mountains, while the bandits in Sichuan are at a disadvantage in the mountains. Furthermore, the peasants in Sichuan are not easily threatened by bandit propaganda due to various reasons. This is another weakness of the bandits in Sichuan. Mr. Deng also showed a telegram from Liu Xiang to Chuan Zhenwu and Deng, saying that someone named Qian is falsely using the name of my representative to swagger around Hong Kong and Guangdong. After investigation, there is no such person as Qian among the representatives of our army. He hopes to make a statement to all parties to avoid confusing the audience. (Guowen News Agency)</p>
<h3>A Sightseeing Record of Xiangfan by Ren An, a Special Correspondent of the Newspaper from Jiangxi, Anhui, Hunan, and Hubei</h3>
<p>Xiangfan Correspondence: From Zaoyang to Xiangfan, the car galloped along a 200-li journey, mostly on winding mountain roads, with few people. Occasionally, two or three villages could be found, with clustered houses, each numbering over a hundred, surrounded by deep earth walls and trenches, resembling small towns. Otherwise, it would be impossible to live there for a day. It is said that this area has suffered from repeated disasters of bandits and drought, and recently even bloodshed. Although small villages have been merged into large villages to avoid remote mountains and live in the plains, the population is still small, the livelihood is difficult, and the social atmosphere is particularly bleak. The car was carrying goods, and there was only enough space for four passengers. Among them was a sickly-looking person, thin and pale, wearing ragged clothes, who looked to be only fourteen or fifteen years old. He was riding for free. When asked about his background, he said, "My name is Xiao Shitou, my surname is Wang, and I am from the Shihuyao in Xiangyang. In June of the lunar calendar, there was a garrison withdrawing to Hankou, and they sealed my family's blue mule, worth 42 yuan, saying that they would pay for grass and feed every day. My mother was reluctant to let it go, so she ordered me to follow them. When we arrived in Hankou, the brigade took a boat to Nanchang. Because I had no money to go home, I stayed in Hankou for two months. I couldn't communicate with my family. When I recovered a little, I began to beg my way back. Tonight, I will be able to see my mother." As he spoke, tears streamed down his face. The reporter happened to have a few loose coins and politely offered them to him. He initially refused firmly, but later only kept one coin to pay for the ferry across the Han River. The car crossed the Tangbai River, passed Zhangjiawan, where ships and warehouses were piled high with cotton, like a cotton collection place. Another 15 li brought us to Fancheng. It was still early, so we crossed the Han River and stayed overnight in Xiangyang.</p>
<p>The so-called Xiangfan refers to Xiangyang and Fancheng. The Han River flows south from here and suddenly bends eastward, meeting the Tangbai River, and then flows south again. The current gradually becomes turbulent, but in this bay, it is very slow. The river surface is even wider than the entrance to the Yangtze River in Hankou by more than twice. Anchoring here can avoid the north wind. The two cities sit facing each other across the Han River's bend, with Fancheng on this side and Xiangyang to the south, about a li apart. The ferry takes 20 minutes. They form a strategic stronghold. The Xianghua, Xiangsha, and Xiangyun motor roads intersect here. In ancient times, it was a strategic place for military campaigns in the north and south. Today, it still retains its important geographical significance. Xiangcheng is named after the Xiang Canal in the southwest. The canal is Tanxi, where it is popularly believed that Mr. Liu jumped across on his horse. The Han River from Xiangyang to Hankou is also called the Xiang River. It is a common mistake that Xiangyang is named after the river, but this is not the case.</p>
<p>The streets of Xiangfan are paved with stone, and are relatively wide and tidy, but not clean. Mud and tiles obstruct the way, and piles of feces, grass, and urine are everywhere, emitting a foul odor. The houses are very short, built in the northern style to prevent wind and snow in winter. They are all fitted with ceilings, and each courtyard has a pit for water drainage. Rainwater accumulates and has no way to drain out, only waiting for natural evaporation and underground absorption. In addition, the fuel used is mostly wheat straw, sesame stalks, sorghum stalks, cotton stalks, and other things. The food is especially fond of deep-fried dough cakes and the like. The smoke and oily smell is unbearable everywhere. With the air so unclean, it is no wonder that many people in the city suffer from eye diseases, with red and rotten eyelids, groping their way along. In the countryside, there are also many people with scabby heads. Old men are bald, and children's heads are covered with scabs, accounting for five or six out of ten. These two diseases are very contagious, especially in the countryside, where people like to use other people's towels and clothing, which is especially harmful. If local people do not actively promote hygiene and passively improve bad habits, what can be said about the impact on the future of health in the entire area? In other places, such as the so-called Shijingchong area, where nine out of ten farmers suffer from abdominal distention, gradually becoming emaciated to the point of death, the number of widows is no less than in the extremely tropical southern India. People attribute it to poor water and soil, and the hard work of the men in the fields. This may or may not be true, but the failure to pay attention to hygiene and prevent infectious diseases is undoubtedly the main reason.</p>
<p>Xiangfan is connected to Henan and Shaanxi in the north, and the livestock industry is quite prosperous. Before the Ping-Han Railway was opened, leather from the south mostly converged here. Although it is no longer what it used to be, there are still many residents engaged in making leather goods. However, due to the long-term blockade of the Han River by bandits, products such as leather trunks, sesame, sesame oil, glutinous rice, and Xiang sugar (that is, glutinous rice candy, whose name is similar to Xiaogan sesame candy) used to sell well in Wuhan, but are now gradually declining. Cotton is still mostly collected and loaded here, and transported in large quantities to the south. However, the clothing and cloth worn in this area are all shipped from Wuhan. The price of cotton is low (only 20 to 30 cents per foot), and the price of cloth is high. In addition, industrial consumables are small in quantity and expensive in quality. Cheaper car transport is the reason why it can fully enter the villages and towns and is a major economic leak for the people of this county. Recently, there has been a proposal to set up a cotton yarn textile factory locally, which is very pertinent. If it can become a reality, it will not only make business flourish.</p>
<p>Nitrate is the most abundant mineral, and rabbits are famous for being produced here. Nitrate can be found everywhere in the sandbars of Xiangcheng, just by looking down. As for the rabbit, a friend told the reporter when he was about to come here from Wuhan to be wary of rabbit bites. At the time, I thought it was a joke, or a coded phrase for bandit robbery, and I didn't believe it at all. Now, seeing that the villagers mostly sell rabbit meat, buying a head for only half a dime, I suddenly remembered my friend's advice and asked the tea servant. According to his reply, "It is not a false rumor that rabbits bite people." I was shocked to hear this. When I asked for the reason again, he continued, "For years, there have been severe droughts in Shaanxi and Henan, and the rabbits have no food to find, so they have gone south in groups, numbering thousands. Northern Xiangyang bears the brunt of this, and in that area, within hundreds of miles, bandits run rampant, and there are no people. The huts are deserted, and reeds grow everywhere, all becoming rabbit dens. They breed and multiply, much more than usual. In the morning and evening, solitary travelers are rarely disturbed. Even shepherds only ten li from the city have been harmed. Now, children in the northern countryside are scared to hear the frightening saying, 'The rabbits are coming to drag people away,' clutching their heads and running away in panic, even crying out loud, because the lessons of the past are enough to serve as a warning." I asked others again, and the answer was the same. This is not only a strange thing, but also a tragedy.</p>
<p>In terms of education, there is only one northern Hubei library for social education, located exclusively in Xiangcheng. It was founded by the former Northwest Army when they were stationed in Xiangyang. There are books and newspapers, and the management is good and the order is excellent. As for school education, there are provincial No. 3 Normal School, No. 5 Middle School, No. 12 Elementary School, and commercially run elementary schools. Among them, the No. 12 Elementary School has the best results. The rest need to be reorganized due to insufficient funding and lack of teachers. The political organs are the Commissioner's Office and the Xiang County Government. The administrative characteristic is in the prohibition of opium, but the exercise of power is always in conflict with the Hubei Special Tax Anti-Smuggling Office (each with a branch in Xiangfan at the ferry, facing each other across the river). Commissioner Liu Ji has achieved remarkable results in the orphanage and nursing home affairs of the Commissioner and is well-known to the people.</p>
<p>Famous scenic spots include Longzhong, the Dropped Tears Monument, the Wenxuan Terrace, the Haoran Pavilion, the Sheep-Du Temple, and Zhenwu Mountain. Among them, Longzhong is the most famous. In the 21st year of the Republic, Commander-in-Chief Chiang Kai-shek came to Xiangyang and visited the area. Seeing that the buildings had not been repaired for many years and the scenic spots were dilapidated, he couldn't bear to hear of them being submerged again. Therefore, he allocated funds for repairs and built a motor road to connect it. It is thirty li from the city. I once visited it with friends. The highway is only for special vehicles, and tourists still have to walk or hire a donkey to travel. Leaving the west gate of the city, passing under Zhenwu Mountain, reaching a high slope, seeing an ancient stele "Grave of the Wronged People Zhang Xingfa" and the "Rest Pavilion" repaired this time, with the Qunshan mountains standing in front, the shape of the pyramid-like Longzhong is now clearly in sight. Fifteen or sixteen li from here, the mountain slopes undulate like waves, the road is rugged, and there is no forest scenery, which greatly reduces the tourist interest. A friend joked, "The road to Longzhong is so difficult to walk, no wonder when Han Zhaolie (Liu Bei) visited Kongming (Zhuge Liang) three times, Zhang Fei couldn't bear the hard work and asked to drag him with a rope made of grass." Before long, we suddenly entered a dense and beautiful forest, treading on fragrant grass, searching for secluded paths. Thus, the Three Visit Hall, the Thatched Cottage Stele, the Ancient Cypress Pavilion, the Farming Field, the Liangfu Rock, the Hugging Knee Stone, the Old Dragon Cave, the Small Rainbow Bridge, the Yeyun Hut, the Half-Moon Creek, and other ten scenes were all viewed in order in the green bamboo and verdant pines, and a kind of noble and quiet air dispelled the worries of the world. Other things, such as the Zhongzheng Hall's incremental construction and the many clean and elegant inscriptions in the Wuhou Temple, are interspersed with the words "Responding as Resonantly" and the use of Taoist priests with queues to serve incense and candles. The meaning of this is probably nothing more than the appreciation of both the refined and the vulgar.</p>

<h3>Various Counties in Southern Anhui Province: Telephoning Requests to Exempt Salt Tax Increase: Taxing 17 or 18 Yuan per Load: Now Taxing an Additional One Yuan per Load</h3>
<p>Huizhou Correspondence: The salt quotas of the counties in Huizhou Prefecture in southern Anhui Province have always belonged to Zhejiang Province, while the salt quotas of Wangjiang, Susong, Taihu, Qiupu, Zhide, and other counties in central Anhui Province have always belonged to Huaibei Province. In recent years, due to the increase in tax rates, the food households have already suffered from increased burdens. In remote counties such as Jixi County, salt costs seventeen or eighteen yuan per hundred catties, which is one-third higher than ten years ago. Recently, the salt in the counties of Huizhou Prefecture and central Anhui Province was ordered to increase by one yuan in tax per load. The food households in Huizhou Prefecture are suffering from years of disasters, famines, and banditry, and the people are in extreme hardship. Now, the sudden increase in such taxes makes it difficult for transporters and the public to obtain food. They have telegraphed overseas hometown associations to send separate telegrams to the Ministry of Finance, the Salt Affairs Administration, and the Zhejiang Salt Transport Envoy, requesting consideration of the people's difficulties and granting exemptions. They have also sent letters to public organizations in various counties to strive together to achieve results. The Chambers of Commerce of Zhide and other counties in central Anhui Province have also telegraphed the provincial government, earnestly requesting that the Ministry of Finance and the General Inspectorate of Salt Affairs be forwarded to withdraw the established case of adding one yuan of salt tax to Wangjiang, Susong, Taihu, and other counties to alleviate the people's difficulties. It is reported that the provincial government, after receiving the telegram, has consulted the Ministry of Finance to investigate whether the order to increase the salt tax by one yuan in Wangjiang, Susong, and Taihu counties by the Datong Salt Affairs Weighing and Release Office was issued with permission from the Ministry and whether it was notified in advance to avoid doubts and requested verification and reply.</p>
<h3>Anhui Province: Jianghuai Main Embankment Project: Economic Commission Replies That No Funds Can Be Allocated: Construction Department Instructs Counties to Collect Labor for Handling</h3>
<p>Anqing Correspondence: The Jianghuai main embankments within Anhui Province were repaired with government relief after the flood in the twentieth year of the Republic of China but could not be fully completed. In August of last year, they were transferred to the Engineering Office of the National Economic Commission for handling. Due to tight funding, not much supplementation was added. During the major flood this year, there were many dangerous spots. The Construction Department sent personnel to protect them in sections, and no major disaster occurred. However, there were many places where the embankments needed to be heightened and thickened, or the embankment line retreated and extension dams added. Moreover, after being washed away by the flood, many sections were eroded and collapsed. The situation was the same on the Huai embankment. The Construction Department repeatedly received requests from the people and forwarded them to the National Economic Commission, urging them to handle it quickly. Recently, the commission replied that the funds allocated to the Engineering Office of the commission to take over the unfinished projects of the Flood Relief Committee have already been fully distributed. There are no more funds to allocate for the embankment projects that should be repaired in the Jianghuai region of Anhui Province. They should be handled on their own. The department has already ordered the counties along the Jiang and Huai rivers to handle it themselves as soon as possible. However, since this is a major project, it may be difficult to achieve the desired results by relying solely on the counties. Therefore, it replied to the Economic Commission to negotiate and requested that a bureau be established to carry out the construction and requested the provincial government to send a telegram to urge it. At the same time, it quickly sought its own solutions to avoid delays. It plans to assign the project to the counties for labor collection and have the province send personnel to supervise and guide them in sections. If the Economic Commission establishes a bureau for construction, these personnel stationed in sections can assist. If they do not come to handle it or only agree to provide some funding for labor, these personnel are even more indispensable. Therefore, it has drafted measures for supervising the repair of the Jianghuai main embankments based on the actual situation, dividing the Jiang embankment into twelve sections and the Huai embankment into six sections, totaling eighteen sections. There will be one general inspector for the Jiang and Huai rivers and twenty supervisors. The work will last for six months from December 1 of this year to the end of May next year. Except for the general inspector, who will be rotated by the department without additional expenses, the total cost of supervision will be 12,880 yuan, which will be forwarded to the provincial government for approval to be paid from the remaining funds of 50,000 yuan from the original flood prevention funds for this year, with the Finance Department allocating it monthly.

<h3>Jiangsu Province: Water Police Reorganization Completed: Six Districts Changed to Four Districts</h3>
<p>Zhenjiang Correspondence: The Jiangsu Provincial Government has decided to reorganize the water police in the entire province, reducing the original six districts to four. It ordered each district to uniformly reorganize all its teams. According to the district chiefs of the fifth and sixth districts, Gong Guoliang, regarding the reorganization of the water police, the following is recorded:</p>
<p>Gong said that Jiangsu Province originally had six water police districts, governing twenty-five teams. The first, second, and third districts each governed five major teams, the fourth district governed three teams, the fifth district governed four teams, and the sixth district governed three teams. There was also a guerrilla team directly under the department, stationed around Suzhou, and a special service team under the jurisdiction of the fourth district, stationed around Nantong. Now, the four major districts have been merged, with the first and second districts merged into the first district, stationed in Minhang, the third district changed to the second district, stationed in Suzhou, the fourth district changed to the third district, stationed in Nantong, and the fifth and sixth districts merged into the fourth district, stationed in Guazhou. The teams under the jurisdiction of each district include four major teams in the first district, six major teams in the second district, four major teams in the third district, and five major teams in the fourth district. The guerrilla team and the special service team have been canceled. All soldiers and guerrillas have been merged into the second district, and the special service team has been merged into the third district. The reorganization of the major teams in each district has been completed. ▲ The chiefs of the four districts have been appointed. After receiving the order to reorganize, Gong ordered all subordinate teams to rush to complete all procedures by the 28th. After the reorganization, the organization and consolidation work continued. The leaders of the four districts have been appointed, with the leader of the fifteenth team concurrently held by Gong himself in accordance with the department's order, the leader of the sixteenth team being Shen Hualong, the leader of the seventeenth team being Wu Zhishan, the leader of the eighteenth team being Zhang Liyou, and the leader of the nineteenth team being Li Panming. The budget for this reorganization was originally more than 104,000 yuan, but the provincial treasury was insufficient, and only enough was issued to pay the remaining salaries for June, July, August, and September to those who left their posts, as well as the salaries for October and November. The salaries of those who were taking their place have not been paid. (28th)</p>
<h3>Yu Surname Family in Songjiang East Outer Suburb Startled After Robbery</h3>
<p>Yu Henian's family in Dongwai is quite famous for its wealth. At the end of this month, bandits robbed them of more than 400 yuan in cash and jewelry, but the case has not yet been solved. Since the original police force in Dongwai was insufficient, a squad from the county police team was dispatched to station there. On this day (28th) at around 1:00 PM, three people wearing Western suits and Zhongshan suits with accents entered and closed the gate, barging straight into the accounting room and forcibly borrowing travel expenses, making a lot of noise. The family members, knowing that something was wrong, immediately telegraphed the Fourth Precinct Station to send the police, who detained the three people. Upon questioning, they identified themselves as Liu Guoping, Li Guokai, and Yang Jun, all from Hunan. Nineteenth Route Army badges were found on them. They claimed to be veterans of the Nineteenth Route Army passing through and borrowing money for travel expenses without any other intention. They tore up the documents on their persons and threw them into the toilet. Outside the gate, two Jiangbei people, Hu Weiming and Chen Dehan, who were selling herbs, were also arrested and taken to the bureau for interrogation.</p>

The defendants continued to provide cunning confessions as before. However, Jin Ayue, a waiter at the Jiuhua Hotel in Shanghai, who was a key witness in the case, was absent due to illness, so the trial was adjourned for further questioning.</p>
<h3>Expansion of Suzhou Vegetable Market Dispute</h3>
<p>The dispute in the vegetable market west of the city, where the Public Security Bureau forced vegetable vendors, triggering a brief strike by shops inside Xumen, was reported in yesterday's newspaper. Yesterday (28th) at 5:00 AM, Inspector Li Yin of the Fifth Precinct and Inspectors Tang Liu and Li of nearby precincts led long police squads. The Second Bureau dispatched a flying team, and the Public Security Bureau dispatched three inspectors to guard all entrances in the Daoqian Street and Yuyuxiang areas, prohibiting vegetable vendors from carrying vegetables into the alley and ordering them to carry them to the Xilikucai vegetable market for business. At that time, chefs from Wang Yiji Sauce Garden in Yuyuxiang and Daji Cloth Shop and other places purchased large quantities of vegetables, fish, and meat from other places for meals, but they were also prevented from entering the alley. In addition, Xie Fuyuan Cake Shop also sold salted fish due to sluggish business, which was also interfered with. Representatives from various shops, including Ye Yinping (Wang Yiji), Wang Jiasheng (Daji), Zhang Linsheng (Xie Fuyuan), and Feng Xunfu (Lao Wannian Silver Shop), and nine others went to the Public Security Bureau to petition, but the result was unsatisfactory. They then went to the county government with the aim of requesting freedom of business and convenient transportation. By that time, it was 10:00 AM. Meanwhile, the vegetable vendors, after this disturbance, had not sold the vegetables they had carried. They gathered forty or fifty people and went to the county government, claiming to sell to the county magistrate, and throwing radishes and other things into the gate of the county government, resulting in a conflict with the police guarding the gate. Four vegetable vendors, including Zhang Ada (female, only fourteen years old, living at No. 3 Cailian Alley nearby) and Wu Baofu, were injured by the police. Later, Secretary Wang of the county government persuaded the representatives of the shops and sent them away, and Zhang Ada and others were sent to Guangmin Hospital for treatment. At 1:00 PM, shops in Daoqian Street, Yuyuxiang, and other places gathered to discuss organizing a joint association and appointed representatives to continue to request attention from the Chamber of Commerce and the County Party Department at around 2:00 PM. If there was no result by night, they prepared to submit a report to the provincial government and call for help.</p>
<h3>Female Worker at Wuxi Yarn Factory Dies Tragically</h3>
<p>Wu Asi, a female child worker, aged sixteen, from Yancheng, at the Zhenxin Yarn Factory outside Ximen, was transferring yarn from the fine yarn section to the cloth machine section upstairs at around 4:00 PM the day before yesterday. Asi took the elevator up, but Asi, being young and playful, stuck her head out of the elevator. Unexpectedly, in a split second, the elevator had risen close to the floor, but Asi did not notice and continued to stick her head out, causing her head to be crushed between the floor and the elevator. Brain matter splattered instantly, and she died immediately. The corpse fell from above, covered in blood and flesh, a tragic sight. Later, the factory notified her mother, Wu Zhang, who came to the factory and mourned loudly. Yesterday morning (28th), Pan Yunzhang, the head of the factory, reported the incident to the County Court.

Therefore, it should be strictly prohibited. Yesterday, a joint announcement was issued to all industries and people in the county, informing them that if any difficulties arise in various industries in the future, they may submit a written request or send representatives to state their case, and there will be proper channels for resolution. Those who dare to violate this will be dealt with severely.</p>

Therefore, all counties in Yangzhou Prefecture whose livelihoods depend directly or indirectly on salt are extremely panicked. In addition to sending representatives to run around in Beijing and Shanghai and seeking to save the situation, yesterday, local groups visited Wang Boling, a member of the Central Committee, to ask for help in reversing the situation.

The responsibility for the rise and fall of the nation cannot be escaped. At this critical moment of national affairs, we should speak out the common voice of the people.

<h3>Du Xigui Leads Students to Nanjing on the Same Ship Last Night; The Sanbei Wanxiang Ship Will Pass Through the Capital Tomorrow; The Ships Stationed in Shanghai Will Sail to Sanduao to Assemble</h3>

<h3>Passing Through Beijing Tomorrow</h3>
<p>The Sanbei Company's Wanxiang ship, after changing to the Shanghai-Hankou route, was originally scheduled to set sail from Shanghai to Hankou at 8 p.m. last night.

However, according to the Sanbei Company's ship office news last night, the goods transported from Fujian to Shanghai were unloaded at 3 p.m., and the loading of goods transported from Shanghai to Hankou began. It is feared that it will not be finished by 12 p.m., so it is expected that the Wanxiang ship can definitely depart no later than 6 a.m. this morning and pass through Xiaguan in the capital tomorrow.</p>

<p>The Guowen News Agency reports: Duan Qirui has been living in Shanghai for a long time, no longer involved in politics. He was once critically ill last month, but after receiving a blood transfusion from a Western doctor and his nephew Duan Honggang, he has recently recovered to his original state. Yesterday, Duan was invited by Chen Jiliang, Commander of the First Fleet of the Navy, to visit the Jiangnan Shipyard. Therefore, at 10:30 a.m., Duan, accompanied by Wu Guangxin (current member of the Pingzheng Council), Liang Hongzhi (former Secretary-General of the Presidential Palace), Zeng Shiyuan, and Duan Honggang (current member of the Supervisory Yuan), and others, totaling more than ten people, traveled in four cars to the Gaochangmiao Naval Headquarters first, and then to the shipyard. After a short rest, Chen Jiliang and Chen Zaofan, Deputy Director of the Shipyard, accompanied them to the machine shop, wooden model shop, foundry, rail steel yard, and electrical power plant for a tour. They then went to the riverside to inspect the docks and the Pinghai and other ships under construction. Finally, they went to the Naval Aircraft Manufacturing Office at the West Fort, where Director Zeng Yijing led them to visit the aircraft manufacturing plant. The visit ended at 11:45 a.m., and they returned by car. Yesterday, Duan wore a silk blue robe and a black jacket, his hair was graying, but his spirit was very good. He walked through the various workshops for five or six miles on foot. When the reporter asked him for his opinion on the current situation while Duan was resting at the aircraft office, he replied that he had been living at home and had not been involved in politics for a long time, so he had no opinion to express on the current situation. When asked about the purpose of his visit, he replied that it was purely a visit, because the Jiangnan Shipyard is the only shipbuilding institution in the country, but it has no historical connection with him personally. When talking with Duan, his voice was quite low, and he seemed to be hard of hearing, but his face was dark, which added to his age. Later, people around him told the reporter that Duan had been receiving artificial sunlight treatments at the Hongen Hospital in West Shanghai every morning for the past month since he recovered from his illness, and he had not stopped.</p>
<h3>Another Civil War Breaks Out in Guizhou; Shanghai Students Interrogate Qiu Yunchang, but Qiu Denies Representing Mao Guangxiang</h3>
<p>In Guizhou Province, the war between Mao Guangxiang and Wang Jialie has been going on for years, and the people have been suffering greatly. Last year, You Guocai, Jiang Jiazhen, and others fought fiercely with Wang Jialie several times, and were finally defeated by Wang and retreated to the border of Sichuan and Yunnan. After Wang designated eight counties in Panjiang as You's defense area, You also expressed his willingness to lead his troops to leave Guizhou and participate in the war against Japan, seemingly maintaining temporary peace. Now, the changes in Jiang's troops in Xiamen have also failed. Recently, a mixed war between the Mao and Wang factions has broken out again within Guizhou Province. Mao Guangxiang has also sent his confidant Qiu Yunchang (Wenbo) to Shanghai with a large sum of money to seek to regain control of Guizhou Province. The Guizhou students in this city are heartbroken by the tragedy of their hometown being ravaged by civil war for years, and on the morning of the day before yesterday, they went to Qiu Yunchang's residence on Bai'erbu Road to interrogate Qiu, expressing their opposition. Qiu said that the news of him carrying a large sum of money to Shanghai was fabricated by others, and that he was not entrusted by Mao. The civil war of the Guizhou warlords has nothing to do with him. He can publish an announcement in the newspaper the next day to clarify. The interrogators at that time said that the news of Qiu's activities in Shanghai had been published in newspapers for more than ten days, and it was not credible to make a clarification at this time. Moreover, the recent war in Guizhou has become more and more fierce, and the extreme opposition between Wang and Mao, and Mao's actions to overthrow Wang, have been detailed in newspapers, which is known to everyone. Anyone who participates in or plots the civil war of the Guizhou warlords should be responsible for the innocent people in Guizhou who have been ravaged. The two sides argued for several hours before leaving. The Guizhou youth in Shanghai also plan to issue a declaration opposing the ongoing and expanding civil war in Guizhou.</p>
<h3>Preparing to Open a Special Express Ship Between Beijing and Hankou; 32 Hours Upstream, Only 24 Hours Downstream</h3>
<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company plans to open a special express ship on the Yangtze River line between Beijing and Hankou, connecting with various railways. This matter was started before the E Ship ran aground. Recently, the Hubei Construction Department's Navigation Administration Office believes that the special express ship between Beijing and Hankou urgently needs to be opened, and has specially formulated measures to contact the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, stipulating that three ships should be dispatched. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has accepted its plan, and the shipping department has begun to plan and handle it. Details are checked and recorded as follows.</p>
<p>Reasons for Increasing Flights: Zhang Yanxiang, Director of the Navigation Administration Office of the Hubei Construction Department, proposed the Beijing-Hankou Express Ship because the Railway Department has now signed a water-land joint transportation contract with the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. The amount of goods transported by the Yangtze River ship upstream and downstream will be more than other companies' ships. Cargo transportation and loading and unloading take time. Passengers traveling to and from various ports on the Yangtze River will definitely be taken away by foreign merchant ships on the same route. The transfer of profits is closely related to the business of domestic passenger transport, so it is necessary to increase the number of special express ships to save it.</p>
<p>Shortening the Journey: The current Yangtze River ship of Six Companies, if Nanjing is the starting point, the fastest time to reach Hankou upstream must be 52 hours. As for sailing downstream from Hankou, due to the favorable current, it is faster, but on average, each Yangtze River ship must also take 36 hours in the downstream flight. If the Beijing-Hankou Express Ship is changed, the unimportant docks will not be stopped, and the three ports of Beijing, Xun, and Han will be designated as official berthing ports. Then the upstream ship only needs 32 hours to reach the distance, and the downstream is faster, only 24 hours to reach the port. Each trip can shorten the journey by more than 30 hours.</p>
<p>Connecting Trains and Ships: The Beijing-Hankou Express Ship departs from Nanjing and is scheduled to connect to the Jinpu and Jinghu express trains at 10 a.m. It can also connect to the Nanxun Road express train at Jiujiang in the afternoon. The next day, it arrives in Hankou and can connect to the Wuchang express train. After staying in Hankou for one night, it departs at 9 a.m. the next morning and can connect to the Pinghan and Xiang'e express trains. The Xiang'e Pinghan and other roads have already been connected. Once the flights are opened, passengers will definitely be crowded.</p>
<p>Three Ships Specified: The Hubei Construction Department and the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company consulted and requested that three Yangtze River ships be dispatched to meet the demand. Each ship travels once, and it takes about four days including berthing time. Compared with the current Yangtze River ship, which takes eight to nine days for each trip, the water income can naturally increase. With three ships, it is expected that one ship can be opened every day, and both Beijing and Hankou will have special express ships going back and forth every day.</p>
<p>Fares Determined: The Navigation Administration Office of the Hubei Construction Department also plans to divide the passenger fares for the upstream and downstream special express ships into three classes: first class, 24 yuan for upper deck cabin, 20 yuan for lower deck cabin, 36 yuan for upper deck berth, 30 yuan for lower deck berth; second class, 14 yuan for upper deck cabin, 24 yuan for berth, 12 yuan for lower deck cabin, 20 yuan for berth; third class, 8 yuan for upper deck cabin, 12 yuan for berth, 7 yuan for lower deck cabin, 10 yuan for berth.</p>

<h3>Jiangsu Fellow Villagers Association Holds a Meeting to Deal with the Fujian Incident; Decides to Telegraph the Central Government to Attack Chen and Li; Publishes a Proclamation to All Fellow Villagers in the Province</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Fellow Villagers Association in Shanghai, due to the seriousness of the Fujian incident, specially convened a meeting of fellow villagers from all counties in Shanghai at the Municipal Party Department hall at 10 a.m. yesterday to discuss countermeasures.

<h3>Resolutions</h3>
<p>After the formalities, He Yuanming reported on the matter, and then began the discussion. Everyone believed that the Fujian incident was serious and should be expressed in order to extend the stop justice. It was decided that: (1) A proclamation to all fellow villagers in the province should be issued (2) A telegram should be sent to Chairman Jiang to send troops to attack as soon as possible in order to quell the source of the chaos (3) A telegram should be sent to the Central Party Department and the National Government to strictly order all military and political authorities to jointly attack the rebellious Chen Mingshu, Li Jishen, and other rebellious elements (4) A letter should be sent to all fellow villagers to participate in the Citizens' Anti-Rebellion Assembly convened by the Municipal Party Department. The meeting adjourned.</p>
<h3>Proclamation to Fellow Villagers</h3>
<p>To all newspaper offices for urgent transfer to all fellow villagers in the province: Ever since the violent Japanese invaded and occupied the Northeast, all people in the country have been working together to avenge the humiliation. Education and development in various periods have been aimed at ten years, hoping to stabilize internally and resist externally, and reverse the dangerous situation. Unexpectedly, Chen Mingshu, Li Jishen, and others, disregarding the consequences, have abandoned the Republic of China founded by Sun Yat-sen, seized the question province, established their own country, and arbitrarily determined the national flag. They have gathered reactionaries in one furnace and plunged the people into dire straits, colluding with Red Russia and the Japanese寇. Wherever the poison gas is spread, it turns into倒懇 (a term for something bad turning into something even worse). Alas, what have the common people done to deserve such poisoning? If we do not launch a large-scale attack, the nest will be in danger. All our elders in the province understand the great righteousness. We hope that everyone will unite and urge the government to immediately issue a proclamation. When the righteous flag is raised, the thieves will be frightened. This association is afraid of the responsibility of every individual and dares to contribute a small suggestion. All people in Jiangsu Province, please take note. Jiangsu Fellow Villagers Association in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>The Jie Sheng Ship Returned to Shanghai from Fujian Yesterday</h3>
<p>After the Fujian incident, Chinese merchant ships in Shanghai, such as Huaan, Taishun, and Wanxiang, have stopped sailing one after another. Currently, only the British Jardine Matheson's Jie Sheng ship and the Japanese Osaka Company's Changsha Maru, Fujian Maru, and Shengjing Maru are sailing between Shanghai and Fuzhou. As for the Nisshin Company's Nanhua ship, it only goes to Hong Kong and Guangdong and does not sail to Fujian, Xiamen, or Shantou. The Jie Sheng ship arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong yesterday afternoon. According to passengers on the ship, the Fujian authorities have started sealing and detaining merchant ships in Fujian ports since the 26th for military use. All Chinese merchant ships docked in Fuzhou that can be used at sea have been detained and are not allowed to leave the port. Fortunately, the Sanbei Wanxiang ship left Fujian on Saturday and sailed out a day earlier, so it was not sealed and detained. However, foreign merchant ships entering and leaving are not detained due to diplomatic relations, so they can still sail as usual. As for the Chinese merchant ships in Fujian, they all have to change to new flags. Yesterday, the Jie Sheng ship came to Shanghai. According to the crew, there was no sealing of ports in Fujian and Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>The Fujian Salt Affairs Branch Office Operates as Usual; Manager Lu Wenlan Is Replaced by Deng Ruiren; Overdue Foreign Debts Are Still Returned on Time</h3>
<p>After the political changes in Fujian Province, most of the central government's tax collection agencies in Fujian have been confiscated by the Fujian People's Government one after another. The Far East News Agency reporter asked whether the salt affairs tax revenue was also affected. Yesterday, he specially visited Zhu Tingqi, Director of the Salt Affairs Audit Office, and Fei Gongyan, the secretary sent to the office, met in his place.</p>
<p>Only the Manager Changed: Fei answered the reporter's question, first saying that after the Fujian Provincial Political Changes became a reality, this office was deeply afraid of suffering misfortune. However, things were unexpected. Except for Lu Wenlan, the Fuzhou Branch Manager and Manager, who was replaced by Deng Ruiren, the rest of the internal personnel did not move. The office is still operating as usual under the supervision of Ruiston, the British Assistant Manager.</p>
<p>Foreign Debt Is Still Remitted: He continued that the income of the Fuzhou Branch Office, in addition to the foreign debt, can be allocated on time. There has never been any surplus remittance to the head office, because the monthly income of the branch office is only more than 400,000 yuan, while the expenditure requires more than 500,000 yuan. The income is not enough to cover the expenditure, so there is no surplus to remit. Now the Fujian side has agreed to return the overdue foreign debt to the branch office on time, so the salt affairs tax revenue has not been affected in reality after the Fujian changes.</p>
<p>Lu Has Gone to Hong Kong: He also said that Lu Wenlan, the Fujian Salt Transport Envoy and Manager of the Fuzhou Branch Office of this office, reported that he had arrived in Shanghai from Fujian, which is not true. Lu originally planned to come to Shanghai directly from Fujian, but because he could not wait for a ship, he first took a boat to Hong Kong a few days ago. This office once sent a telegram to inquire about his whereabouts. According to the reply, he will take a boat to Shanghai from Hong Kong in the next few days and report everything to the Ministry of Finance in Beijing.</p>

<h3>China Aviation Company's Shanghai-Guangdong Line's Aircraft No. 17 Departed on Time Yesterday; The Mail Left Over from the Previous Flight Was All Taken by the Aircraft; A Telegram Said That It Had Safely Arrived in Guangzhou at 5:50 p.m.</h3>
<p>Since the official opening of the China Aviation Company's Shanghai-Guangdong route, it carried mail for one month and began to carry passengers on the 24th of this month. Unexpectedly, due to bad weather and dense fog, Aircraft No. 16 crashed into a mountain and fell into the sea near Zhoushan Island in Hangzhou Bay, resulting in injuries to all nine passengers and pilots. Aircraft No. 16 was also completely destroyed and could not be salvaged. Yesterday was the scheduled flight for the company's Shanghai-Guangdong route southbound. The reporter of the Dagong News Agency inquired about the flight situation. Mr. Liang Jingzhao of the company's business group told the following:</p>
<h3>Departing on Time</h3>
<p>According to Mr. Liang, Aircraft No. 17 was piloted by chief pilot Ge Situo and co-pilot Wu Te. It still took off from Longhua Airport on time at 6 a.m. this morning (i.e., yesterday morning). All the mail left over from the previous flight was taken by the aircraft. The scattered Guangdong mail was all completely recovered and also taken by the aircraft.</p>
<h3>Number of Passengers</h3>
<p>There were a total of seven passengers, five of whom got off in Fuzhou, and the other two went all the way to Guangzhou. However, when Aircraft No. 17 arrived in Fuzhou, there were five more passengers on board, two of whom went to Xiamen, two to Shantou, and the remaining one all the way to Guangzhou.</p>
<h3>Arrived Safely in Guangdong</h3>
<p>After Aircraft No. 17 departed from Shanghai, the company received a radio telegram from the aircraft, saying that it arrived in Shantou at 2:25 p.m. It departed from Shantou at 2:55 p.m. At 5:50 p.m., it received another telegram, saying that it had safely arrived in Guangdong.</p>

The treatment is progressing very well. Although the co-pilot, the American Aimo, has both legs broken, it can be assured that there is no danger to his life.</p>
<h3>Eurasia Company to Employ Chinese Pilots – News of Ma Zhongying's Capture of Dihua is Inaccurate</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, regarding the report that Ma Zhongying's troops in Xinjiang had captured Dihua, the Central News Agency reporter inquired with the Eurasia Aviation Company and was told that it was inaccurate. It was also learned that because all the pilots of the company are foreigners, which is inconsistent with the fundamental purpose of promoting aviation in the country, the company has decided to hire Chinese pilots. However, since the pilot's relationship with passengers is very important, strict selection is required in terms of technology before they can be employed.</p>

<h3>Reasons for the Drop in Standard Yarn Prices</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, since the Cotton Control Association took measures to stabilize yarn prices in order to relieve yarn mills and promote sales, yarn sales have been smooth. Unexpectedly, the price of November standard yarn on the Yarn Exchange suddenly dropped by six yuan at the last moment, surprising everyone. The truth is tentatively explored as follows: The standard yarn samples stored by the Cotton Control Association at the Yarn Exchange are of too low quality, giving manufacturers the opportunity to submit inferior yarn. The validity period of these standard yarn samples is due to expire at the end of this year. For emergency purposes, the Ministry of Industry is requested to instruct the exchange to suspend the acceptance of new yarn submissions in November and December to reduce harm to the yarn industry. The exchange, being a speculative market, then had some people organize a bull company, buying November and December standard yarn, unaware that the yarn prices in the Yarn Exchange in November and December were only sufficient to replace a batch of accumulated inferior yarn. The bull company, unaware, raised the price, causing the standard price to exceed the current selling price of inferior yarn on the market by four or five yuan. Who knew that on the last day of bidding for November standard yarn, the bull company suddenly disintegrated for some reason, selling all of its more than ten thousand pieces of goods in one day, resulting in a sharp drop of six yuan in standard yarn prices. Now, starting from December, standard yarn prices have stabilized and are equal to the current spot prices on the market.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Finance and Tax Administration Cancels Ban on Rice and Wheat Exports; Bran Cannot Be Handled Similarly</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Flour Milling Industry Association previously stated that the excessive surplus of agricultural products in various regions directly affected prices. To seek relief, they requested the Tax Administration to allow the export of wheat flour. The Tax Administration has now approved the request. The original approval is recorded below. The case of banning the export of wheat flour was originally due to domestic disasters and insufficient food supply at the time, and this Ministry was ordered to handle it. Now the situation of excessive surplus of agricultural products in various regions is the opposite of the previous situation. The request to allow the export of No. 2, 3, and 4 wheat flour can be approved. However, wheat flour is not subject to customs duties. The current tax is still a special tax, which is clearly different from other grains that are subject to customs duties. It should not be completely exempt from tax. The special tax on wheat flour should still be collected according to the regulations. After export, half of the actual tax amount should be refunded to comply with the regulations and encourage exports. As for bran, it is mostly an industrial product, with large annual exports, and has never been banned. Its nature is different from that of grain, so it is difficult to grant the same tax exemption. Moreover, the Association submitted a request for tax exemption on bran exports in July of this year, which was disapproved by this Ministry. It should be handled accordingly. In addition to forwarding the report and issuing orders, this approval is for your information.</p>
<h3>Gu Xin-yi and Others Send Another Letter to Representatives of Nine Provinces and Cities to Discuss the Formation of Grain Production and Sales Organizations; Meeting to Discuss on December 6 in Shanghai; Shanghai Representatives Plan to Send Another Letter Urging Attendance as Scheduled</h3>
<p>The grain production and sales organizations of nine provinces and cities were previously decided by the grain conference of eight provinces. Wu Xingru, a representative from Shanghai, drafted seven articles of an outline for grain production and sales cooperation methods, which were submitted to Chairman Chiang for approval and responsible for preparation. Representatives from Shanghai, Wu Huanru and others, have drafted a plan to convene representatives from various provinces and cities in Shanghai on December 6 to discuss implementation methods. However, after sending the letter, the provinces have not yet responded. According to Zhou Minggang of the Social Affairs Bureau, the provinces of Zhejiang, Anhui, and Jiangxi have replied, but there has been no concrete indication regarding the raising of previously stipulated share funds. Now, representatives from Shanghai, Gu Xin-yi, Wu Huanru, Zhou Minggang, etc., plan to send another letter urging representatives from various provinces to attend the meeting as scheduled. The case concerns the relief of the rural economy, and it is expected that representatives from various provinces will bravely participate in the meeting. The original letter from Gu Xin-yi and others to the governments of Hunan, Hubei, Zhejiang, Fujian, Hebei, Anhui, Jiangxi, Guangdong, and other provinces and representatives of the rice industry is recorded below: We, Xin-yi and others, were ordered to prepare for the grain transportation and sales organization. Previously, we drafted an outline of cooperation methods for grain production and sales, which was submitted to Chairman Chiang of the Military Affairs Commission for instructions. We also sent a letter to you to solicit the opinions of grain merchants in your province and quickly raise the shares to be subscribed. We have received Order No. 387 from the Nanchang Camp of the Chairman, which states that the proposed outline of cooperation methods for grain production and sales in seven articles, with a capital of one million collected by local merchants and another million borrowed by the government at interest, is feasible. It is also specified that the one million yuan allocated by the central government should be guaranteed in principal and interest by the merchants, which can be approved. Please follow the various regulations of the outline and earnestly organize the organization, and quickly collect and report the one million yuan of merchant shares to this camp to request the government to designate a bank to borrow or overdraft the full amount, so as to provide assistance. The outline is available for reference. In view of this order, we are now witnessing the arrival of new grains and a continuous decline in grain prices. Adjusting surpluses and deficits and raising grain prices are now urgent tasks. Organizing grain transportation and sales organizations is an essential plan.

<h3>Fisheries Administration to Close at the End of the Month; Establishment of a Fish Market Difficult to Realize for the Time Being</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, after the central government approved the temporary closure of the fisheries administrations in various regions, the Jiangzhe District Fisheries Administration in this port received instructions from the Ministry of Industry a few days ago to handle the closure. It is understood that the reason for the closure is related to the collection of fisheries construction fees. After the closure of the bureau, all its work will be handled directly by the Ministry of Industry. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Deadline for Closure: After receiving the order to close the Jiangzhe District Fisheries Administration, the director of the bureau, Yuan Ji, ordered all staff to handle the closure. The Ministry order originally limited the bureau to close at the end of the month. Now the deadline is approaching, and most of the work can be completed. For other trivial matters that cannot be completed in time, a small number of staff will be temporarily retained to continue handling them.</p>
<p>Reasons for Closure: According to Wu Huanru, a member of the Fisheries Improvement Committee, speaking to a reporter from the Central News Agency, although fisheries construction is important, there are many businesses to be developed, and it is difficult to achieve them due to limited funds. As for the collection of fisheries construction fees, if implemented, it would be difficult to use them all for fisheries construction. The authorities had promised that after collecting fisheries construction fees, all ship donations and other miscellaneous donations in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shanghai would be waived. The three provinces and cities of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shanghai would need to allocate more than 100,000 yuan from the fisheries construction fee revenue to compensate for the exemption of fishing boat donations. In addition, after deducting expenses such as ocean protection, the remaining tens of thousands of yuan would be insufficient to develop the fisheries construction industry. Therefore, the central government decided to close the Fisheries Improvement Committee and the Fisheries Construction Fee Collection Office, as there was no need to establish them. The business and expenses of the Fisheries Administration could not be planned, and it was decided to temporarily suspend them.</p>
<p>Future Plans: Wu also said that the Ministry of Industry will continue to handle the passive aspect of ocean protection and plans to jointly establish a fish market between the central government and the city. The Ministry of Industry and the Shanghai Social Affairs Bureau have sent personnel to Nagasaki, Japan, and Qingdao, China, to visit fish markets for reference. They have recently returned to Shanghai and will submit a detailed report. Whether the government will operate it or whether it will be jointly operated by the government and merchants has not yet been determined. Recently, a preparatory committee will be organized to plan everything. The market will be located in the coastal area of the city, with a capital of more than one million yuan. However, there is no funding for the capital yet.</p>
<h3>Farmers in Gaoqiao District Petition for Permanent Tenancy Rights in Jiangxinsha</h3>
<p>More than 700 acres of land in Daxi Dang, Jiangxinsha, Tu 27, Gaoqiao District of this city, were invested in by farmers from Chongming around 1924 and obtained permanent tenancy rights. After years of hard work, the land was finally cultivated, and they divided the harvest with the landlord at a ratio of 4:6, living in peace. Unexpectedly, the landlord, Hu Rongcao of Daxingzhuang, suddenly sold all the cultivated land in the area to Lever Brothers, a British company, this autumn to build an oil field, earning hundreds of thousands of yuan and disregarding the lives of hundreds of farmers in the area. He even threatened to demolish the thatched huts and expel them. The farmers in each morning took their lives, and since they had obtained permanent tenancy rights, they decided not to let the landlord sell it privately. At 2:00 yesterday afternoon, they jointly sent representatives from the entire area, including Huang Zhirong, Shi Tingtong, Geng Xinggao, Jin Genggen, Song Dalang, Ding Wangfu, Dong Ergou, Huang Youcai, Zhang Qiaofu, and more than 40 others, to the city party headquarters and the city council to petition. Lu Yinchu, a cadre from the Civil Training Section of the City Party Headquarters, received them and promised to investigate and handle the matter. Yu Zhenhui, a member of the Standing Committee of the City Farmers Association, received them and promised to handle the matter together with the City Party Headquarters in accordance with the law. The representatives were satisfied and left.</p>

<h3>Increased Water Transport Costs Due to River Closure in North China</h3>
<p>The weather in North China has been severely cold recently, and Yingkou and Tianjin have already had snowfall. After the Taikoo steamer "Daming" sailed to Niuzhuang last Saturday, the shipping companies in this port will no longer send ships to Yingkou this year due to the impending freezing. As for Tianjin, the date of river closure is also approaching. Starting from December 1st, the shipping companies in Shanghai to Tianjin have already publicly discussed increasing the water transport costs for the ice river yesterday. For foreign cloth and cotton yarn, an additional 1% will be charged according to the fixed rate, and for various groceries, an additional 20% will be charged according to the original amount. However, whether to increase the cost for flour has not yet been decided. Yesterday, the companies notified the customers in North China to take note.</p>
<h3>Li Delie Returns to Australia</h3>
<p>According to the China Mail, the Australian Li Delie came to China 47 years ago and initially served in the Jiujiang Church. The current Western residential area of Guling was purchased and developed by Li on that day. In 1900, he joined the Shanghai Brunner Mond &amp; Co., Ltd. At that time, annual sales were less than 200 tons, but by the time Li left the company in 1919, it had increased to more than 40,000 tons. From 1904 to 1906, he served as a director of the Shanghai Municipal Council. In 1912, the Wuchang Uprising broke out, and then Wu Tingfang and Tang Shaoyi of the North and South factions negotiated a peace. Li mediated between them, and the meeting place was Li's residence on Gordon Road. After all matters were agreed upon, a public meeting was held at the old council hall on Nanjing Road, where the conditions were signed, and Puyi abdicated. After leaving Brunner Mond &amp; Co., Ltd., Li served as the first Australian Commercial Commissioner to China for two and a half years. Later, the position was abolished, and Li lived in New South Wales, but still occasionally came to China for short trips. He recently returned to Shanghai and, tired of traveling, will return to Australia with his wife today (the 28th). Li recently celebrated his 70th birthday.</p>

<h3>Animal Hibernation, City Zoo Opens Greenhouse, Hibiscus Competition Registration Closes Tomorrow</h3>
<p>The Municipal Zoo of this city, due to the gradually colder weather and animal hibernation, has opened the greenhouse. The registration for the Hibiscus Competition will close tomorrow. The details are recorded separately as follows:</p>
<h3>Animal Hibernation Starts Using Greenhouse</h3>
<p>The zoo, considering that the weather is getting colder and the animal hibernation season has arrived, such as reptiles and amphibians, have all stopped moving. Therefore, the hot water radiator laid by the zoo has been used every night starting yesterday to keep the temperature in the animal house moderate to maintain their lives. If the weather gets colder, the greenhouse will be used day and night.</p>
<h3>Hibiscus Competition Registration Deadline</h3>
<p>Since the start of soliciting, the Hibiscus Competition held by the zoo has received enthusiastic registrations from Chinese and Westerners. Registration will close on the 30th of this month. It is estimated that more than 70 people and more than hundreds of hibiscus will participate in this event. The number of German species and Chinese species is equal, followed by British species and Dutch species, and mixed species. In total, foreign species are more numerous than domestic species.</p>
<h3>Scheduled Opening to Invite Reporters</h3>
<p>The Hibiscus Competition is scheduled to open on December 10th. The judges have already been hired. In order to expand publicity and encourage the breeding of songbirds, the zoo will specially invite reporters from various newspapers to visit and conduct public reviews on the opening day. In order to limit the number of spectators, admission tickets will be charged.</p>
<h3>Crowds of Tourists Vie to See Large Tortoises</h3>
<p>Since the zoo purchased a large tortoise from the Philippines and displayed a pair of bats, the number of tourists has doubled in recent days. However, the circumference of this tortoise is less than one square foot, which is quite different from the reported three feet long and two feet wide (Shanghai News Agency).</p>
<h3>China Foreign Famine Relief Association Holds Yellow River Disaster Relief Near News</h3>
<p>The Shanghai office of the China Foreign Famine Relief Association at No. 49 Nanjing Road, Public Concession, received a telegram from the Beijing General Association yesterday, reporting that at the 124th Executive Committee meeting held on the 22nd of this month, a resolution was passed to send personnel to the Yellow River flood disaster areas in various provinces to start agricultural relief work and allocate all current donations.</p>
<h3>Inspector of the Yellow River Disaster Relief Committee Reports on the Situation of Providing Congee in Shandong</h3>
<p>The disaster relief group of the Yellow River Flood Relief Committee previously sent an employee, Shi Xuan, to inspect the disaster and relief work in Hebei, Shandong, and Henan. The committee received Shi Xuan's report yesterday on the inspection of the investigation office and the operation of the congee factory in Shandong. It generally stated that the work of the investigation office was carried out in a very organized manner and the external impression was also very good. There are currently seven congee factories set up, established in areas with a relatively large number of victims. Each factory provides congee for 2,000 people. The congee provision is divided into two methods: (1) distribution under normal circumstances; (2) distribution of relief grain. The second item is a flexible method based on the situation. Because many victims prefer to receive congee and grain at home and cook it with taro and beans at any time, it is more filling and convenient than going to the factory to eat or receiving congee at home, especially when the weather is cold and the road is far away. Therefore, those who are allowed to receive dry food will receive it once every ten days, calculated on a daily basis, and the congee and grain will be paid to them for self-cooking. The factory can also save a lot of fuel, and the remaining money will be used to purchase rice and grain to increase the number of eaters. A complaint box is also set up for eaters to contribute their opinions. The congee provided is requested by health personnel to inspect nearby at any time to avoid unsanitary and other malpractices.</p>
<h3>Charity Federation Raises Funds for Winter Shelters</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Charity Federation held a meeting at 4:00 PM the day before yesterday. Attendees included Wang Yiting, Huang Hanzhi, Wang Xiaolai, Chen Liangyu representing Pushan Villa, Wu Shutian representing Shanghai Charity Group, Wang Zhongfu representing Guangyi Shantang and China Relief for Women and Children Association, Huang Juntang representing Weizhong Shantang, Weng Yin first representing Lianyi Shantang and Lianyi Branch, Chen Wenkui representing Shanghai Disabled Persons' Hospital, Sun Yishan representing Hunan Zishan Society, Zhang Junkang representing Shanghai Orphanage, Qi Taofu representing Baoan Nursing Home, Fang Zhijun representing Renji Shantang, Chen Kaifeng representing Renji Infant Nursery, and Huang Hanzhi representing Xinwei Relief Society. Chairman Wang Yiting first reported that the association has been setting up temporary winter shelters every year to accommodate civilians. Now that winter is approaching and severe cold is coming, at this time when rural areas are bankrupt and all industries are depressed, the number of civilians who are hungry, cold, displaced, and unable to support themselves must be greater than in previous years. Winter shelters should be opened earlier. The Social Bureau has also sent a letter urging us, but the funds for the winter shelters are not specific and rely entirely on temporary fundraising. In the current social situation, fundraising is not guaranteed. Each charity group has annual donations, and this year's situation is more difficult, especially hoping for efforts to donate to cope with it. It was decided that the economic conditions of each charity group have been difficult in recent years, and assistance should be provided for the funds of the winter shelters.

The amount was considerable. It has been two years, and the Chamber of Commerce has once urged the authorities to reimburse the funds, but they have not been returned. Now, with the Wusong area's market depressed and the year-end approaching, they hope for reimbursement as eagerly as for rain. Several businesses are waiting for these funds to be repaid to settle debts. After the Wusong Eighth District Party Department sent a letter to the Chamber of Commerce, the Chamber yesterday sent a letter to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce requesting it to find a way to allocate the funds before the end of the year to alleviate the merchants' difficulties.</p>

<h3>Cigarette Paper Shop Exchanges Counterfeit Silver Coins, Fang Zhengwu Wrongly Detained for One Day</h3>
<p>Fang Zhengwu, who resides at No. 5 Yongxiangfang, Tongfu Road and works in a foreign firm, recently passed by Fuyou Road in the city and exchanged five yuan in banknotes for one yuan in silver coins at Qingchengfeng Cigarette Paper Shop at No. 419. He received four yuan in silver dollars, six double coins, and fifteen copper coins. He took them elsewhere. When passing Xiaonanmen, he needed change and exchanged one silver dollar for coins at a cigarette paper shop there. Unexpectedly, it was discovered to be a counterfeit silver dollar. Fang immediately argued that it was exchanged at Fuyou Road. The shop did not believe him and searched him, finding another counterfeit silver dollar among the remaining three yuan. Accused of using counterfeit silver dollars, the police from the post detained him in the First District and First Precinct for investigation. Fortunately, Fang knew Chief Hong of the Second Section and was able to prove his innocence and was released, but he had been wrongly detained for one day. Yesterday at 5:20 p.m., Fang used a five-yuan transit ticket, with a secret mark of the character "Lu" on the ticket, and went to Qingchengfeng Cigarette Paper Shop to exchange for coins again. The shop still gave him two yuan in counterfeit silver dollars, two yuan in good silver dollars, six double coins, and fifteen copper coins. As soon as Fang saw the counterfeit silver dollars, he immediately questioned the shop, but the shop denied it, saying it was a switch. Therefore, Fang called Fan Delin from the 17th post to come. Because there was no evidence, he immediately called the precinct to report the matter and asked for a team to come and search. Unexpectedly, at this moment, the shop owner and others escaped in the meantime. Only two shop assistants were arrested. Patrol Captain Li Fuyi found thirty-five silver dollars (the counterfeit silver dollars among them were difficult to identify), twenty-eight yuan in banknotes, seventy-one cents in coin tickets, seven hundred forty-four good double coins, six hundred thirty-two Shantou coins, seventy new coins, one hundred seventy-four private plates, eighteen lead coins, thirty-two single coins, and twenty damaged single coins in a wooden comb box in the shop. They were all detained for investigation. According to Liu, the precinct chief, the defendant, Zhang Lixuan, 19 years old, from Shaoxing, a clerk at Qingchengfeng, and another named Chen Nian, 35 years old, from Shaoxing, who left Qingchengfeng shop, claimed that the boss had fled and they did not know anything about the shop. They were sent to the Shanghai Public Security Bureau for legal action.</p>
<h3>How Did Female Worker Bian Zhaoyou Die? The Court Must Find a Way to Re-examine</h3>
<p>Bian Yonggen, 30 years old, from Shaoxing, residing at No. 43 Wuhuali, Huade Road, Hongkou, works as a carpenter for a living. He has a niece named Bian Zhaoyou, 16 years old. Because of the hard life in the countryside, she came to Shanghai last spring and was introduced to work at the Shenxin Yarn Factory in Zhoujiaqiao, West Shanghai. For the convenience of going back and forth, she lived in the boarding house opened by her fellow villager Zhang Qian at No. 71 Shenxin Workers' Quarters near the factory. The girl could earn more than ten yuan a month. After deducting the cost of food, she could save several yuan a month. She had been working diligently for more than a year and a half. Unexpectedly, the day before yesterday, her uncle Bian Yonggen suddenly received a report that his niece Zhaoyou had been abused and beaten to death by the owner of the boarding house, Zhang Qian, and had been dead for several days and had not yet been placed in a coffin. Bian was shocked and immediately rushed to the scene. Sure enough, he saw that his niece's body was still there. Bian then twisted the owner of the boarding house, Zhang Qian, to the Chenjiadu Sixth District Police Station, and transferred her to the Sixth District, accusing her of murdering someone. After receiving the report, District Chief Tan ordered the map and land guard to report to the local court for an examination. Yesterday, the court appointed Inspector Yang to inspect the scene. It was examined that the female corpse had been dead for about ten days. The skin was swollen and another method was needed for detailed examination. Therefore, he returned to the court without examining. Then, District Officer Xing interrogated and recorded the statement of the plaintiff Bian Yonggen, and also the statement of the defendant Zhang Qian, 32 years old, from Shaoxing, who runs a boarding house in Shenxin Workers' Quarters. She said that after the girl Zhaoyou lived in the boarding house last year, she treated her very well. Now she suddenly died of a sha disease. She had asked Chinese and Western doctors in the factory to diagnose her and take medicine, and there was no abuse or beating. After getting the statements, the district officer temporarily detained her because the case involved a life. After the investigation is clear, and the court re-examines, it will be handled after verification.</p>
<h3>Concurrent Record of Two Corpse Examinations</h3>
<p>(1) At the entrance of Shanyuan Lane, Ju'an Street, Lao Beimen, at 1 p.m. yesterday, a female corpse suddenly appeared. She was about 30 years old, wearing blue cloth clothes, with a pockmarked face, resembling a domestic servant. The police saw her and touched her chest, which was still warm, but soon she died of breathlessness. Judging from the situation, it was obvious that she had been thrown out by her residents when she was critically ill. He reported to the First Precinct of the Second District, ordered to investigate which family threw her out, and ordered Jia Jiang Pingyang to report to the local court for an examination. Inspector Yang and others came to the scene and verified that she had died of illness, and ordered the hall to collect her body for investigation and verification. (2) A nameless male corpse was found in Taiping Lane, Nanshi Wai Ma Road, yesterday morning. He was about 30 years old, wearing a tattered cotton-padded jacket made of black cloth, blue cloth pants, and tattered cloth shoes. The patrolling police reported to the First Precinct Police Station and sent Jia Lu Yongde from the Sixteenth Pupu to report to the local court for examination. Afterwards, the inspector verified that he died of illness and the hall collected his body.</p>
<h3>Investigation and Detention for Selling Counterfeit Cigarettes</h3>
<p>Lu Changsheng, the chief detective of the interview department of the French Concession Police Department, received a secret report the day before yesterday, stating that Wang Binghe (26 years old), a native of Yong, who lives at No. 69 Hongyuan Lane, Huade Road, Hongkou, has recently been privately manufacturing counterfeit "Dazhongnan" and "Fairy" brand cigarettes and selling them to famous cigarette paper shops for profit. At noon today, Wang carried cigarettes to various cigarette paper shops near the Great World to sell them. The detective immediately accompanied detective Chen Yishan and the informant to wait at the entrance of the Great World. At 12:30 p.m., Wang was seen walking slowly with a paper bag. He was immediately detained and the paper bag was opened. Inside were fifty packs of "Dazhongnan" and "Fairy" brand 20-cigarette packs, totaling one thousand cigarettes. He was taken to the police station. According to Wang's confession, the manufacturing facility was located at his home at No. 69 Hongyuan Lane, Huade Road. The detectives then took Wang to the Yulin Road Police Station to report the incident and asked for detectives to go with them to search. Xia Shuxiang, a native of Zhenjiang who co-owned the business with Wang, was seen working on rolling cigarettes in the back room of the reception hall. He was immediately arrested and 5,000 counterfeit cigarettes, about 3,000 sheets of cigarette paper, about ten kilograms of tobacco, three seals used on cigarette packs (Dazhongnan and Fairy, both in Chinese and Western characters), and items used for rolling cigarettes were confiscated. They were all brought back to the police station and sent to the Second Special District Court yesterday. At 3 p.m., Judge Sun Pengxian tried the case in the Eighth Criminal Court.

<h3>Assassination of Candle Shop Owner; Accomplices Escorted from Ningbo to Shanghai for Trial</h3>
<p>Chen Chukui, 29 years old, a native of Ningbo and the owner of Qianfengtai Candle Shop at No. 51 and 52 Xinqiao Street in the French Concession, was shot in the throat by thugs on April 29th of this year at about 8 p.m. when he returned to the store from outside and detoured to the small alley next door. At the same time, Chen Qiancheng, the manager of the store, heard the sound and went out to rescue him, but was also injured. (According to reports, the two thugs borrowed two pistols from Wang Liutang, a tenant in Chen's pavilion room, and went downstairs. They happened to meet Chen in the alley and questioned him. The thugs, fearing that things would go wrong, took out their guns to resist, resulting in a major disaster.) Later, the French Concession Police Department arrested the murderer Zhu Quanxing, a native of Wuxi (20 years old, living at No. 40 Shungui Lane, Father Du Road, the younger brother of Luo Zhutourong, a member of the flower club), and found two pistols and several bullets in the grass pile in the cemetery of the Siming Guild Hall outside the back door of No. 7 Yuqing Lane, Baliao Bridge Road. He was sent to the Second Special District Court for prosecution. Zhu was sentenced to 15 years in prison for murder. Zhu refused to accept the original judgment and appealed to the Third High Court. The case is currently being heard. According to Zhu, his accomplice Chen Jinlan, a native of Yong, nicknamed Snake Skin, 31 years old, had been investigated by the police department and found to have fled to the Ningbo countryside. A warrant was specially issued by the Second Special Court, and a document was sent to the Ningbo Public Security Bureau, requesting assistance in the arrest. Chen has now been arrested by the local Public Security Bureau, and the French Concession Police Department has been notified to send detectives to Ningbo to escort him back. He arrived in Shanghai by steamer yesterday morning and was brought to the police station. He was immediately transferred to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special District.

One of them, an acquaintance, stepped forward to argue with him. After a disagreement, he showed a sharp blade and stabbed him in the left shoulder, two stabs in the left waist, and one stab in the left arm. Blood was flowing non-stop. Chen Zhiming cried for help after being injured. The murderers fled in a panic. The patrol police heard the alarm and rushed to the scene and arrested one accomplice on the spot.

<h3>Young Woman Abducted and Sold into Prostitution by Villains</h3>
<p>Zhu Hongbao, a woman, is now 20 years old, from Wuzhen, Zhejiang Province. She has a beautiful appearance and is extremely promiscuous. Two years ago, in August, she married Lu Ada, who worked as a barge operator, through a matchmaker. Lu made a living by boat, and due to life problems, he could not often accompany his beautiful wife to enjoy the fun of the boudoir. Therefore, he often made Hong sell the empty boudoir and stay alone, lamenting her bitter fate. Soon Zhu became acquainted with a Lu Abao. Lu was in his prime and was able to win Zhu's heart, living together like a couple. In the summer of this year, Lu Abao lured Zhu with sweet words, saying how prosperous Shanghai was and that it would be good to take a trip. If she could marry a wealthy husband, she would not have to worry about eating for the rest of her life. The woman was tempted by his words and came to Shanghai with him, staying at the Sihai Hotel on Tianjin Road. Unexpectedly, Lu had bad intentions and secretly discussed with Wang Caiying, a procuress at No. 507 Zhejiang Road, to sell Zhu. She was sold for 210 yuan. From then on, Zhu fell into the fire pit. Wang forced her to go out to pick up customers every night and ordered a maid, Fu Li, to supervise her. Zhu suffered all kinds of abuse and could not bear the suffering. Sometimes business was slow, so she had to be whipped by Wang. She tried to jump out of the fire pit, but had no chance. Last night, Wang ordered Chuan Li to accompany Zhu Hongbao to pick up customers. Suddenly, Wang Hailin, a Chinese detective from the Lao Zha Police Station, and Chinese police officer No. 1266 passed by. Zhu reported to the detectives. The police arrested Chuan Li and went to arrest Wang Caiying. They also found Wu Zhaodi, a 16-year-old girl. According to Wang, she was bought from Wu Zhang, an old woman at No. 715 Tiantong Road. Zhaodi was her daughter. Due to economic pressure, she sold her to her. The detectives then arrested Wu Zhang and took them back to the police station. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the First Criminal Court of the First Special District. Police lawyer Zhang Shizhu stated the previous situation and requested that they be punished according to Article 257 of the Criminal Law. Wang and the women then separately filed complaints about falling into the fire pit. When questioned, the defendant claimed that Zhu Hongbao was purchased from Lu Abao, and Wu Zhaodi was a mortgage and not sold completely. Feng Shide, the head of the Criminal Court, verified the confession and ordered that the case be sentenced next Tuesday. The defendants were taken back into custody. Zhu Hongbao and Wu Zhaodi were temporarily handed over to the Jiliang Institute for foster care.</p>
<h3>Madman Accuses Mother | Full of Nonsense, Unreasonable to Describe |</h3>
<p>Jiang Zongchao, the son of Jiang, a wealthy man in Kunshan, was originally a well-educated scholar, hence the nickname "bookworm". Last year, his second wife suddenly had an affair and took away his tuition fund and fled, and finally resolved the matter with a divorce. Jiang suffered a major blow from this, and was extremely sad and indignant. He became mentally ill and often destroyed things. The family could not bear the pain and sent him to a mental hospital. He threatened to go on a hunger strike, and had no choice but to take him back home. Then he fled to Shanghai alone, drifting like a beggar. After receiving the letter, he entrusted relatives to capture and detain him nearby, but he escaped again. After escaping, he actually wrote a complaint, accusing his mother and relatives. He held the complaint and went straight to the local court and the prosecutor's office the day before yesterday. The judge was entangled, and then the bailiff waved him down and ordered him to go to the dispatch office to hand in the complaint. After the prosecutor verified the complaint, he ordered Shuangchuan Fang to come to the court for questioning yesterday morning. Jiang was full of nonsense and incoherence and did not know what he was talking about. The interrogating officer asked his mother, only to find out that he was a madman. He was handed over to his mother and others to be taken back for custody. However, Jiang roared and yelled and was unreasonable, so the family requested that he be sent to the Xinpuyu Hall Mental Hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3>Flower Club Collection Officers Sentenced Separately</h3>
<p>Lu Laoqi, the huge gangster woman of the Flower Club who was repeatedly wanted by the Fahua police authorities, and Ma Pi Ajin, Dai Yunqing, etc., were aware of the severe situation and planned to develop in the public concession, sending out many collection officers to collect money and secretly open barrels in various places in the public concession. Lu Liankui, the Chinese superintendent of the General Inspectorate, found out about this and ordered Chinese detective Feng Zhiming, detective Zhou Honglin, and Baotan Zhang Changgui to investigate in four directions. Then, Detective Feng and others arrested a Chen Shanfu, who confessed that the main criminals were Lu Laoqi and others, and sent Chen to the First Special Court for interrogation and detention. The case has been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning was the day for the follow-up hearing. Police lawyer Qian Xunjiu said that the police had gone to arrest him several times in this case, but they had all heard the news and fled far away, so they could not be arrested.

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>Dear Editor, I have just read a news item in the "Local News" column of your newspaper on the 28th of this month about a false fire alarm, which stated, "Up and down, I have no choice but to be crowded, and the door is narrow, and I am crowded. More than a dozen workers with weak strength were crowded and fell to the ground and were trampled, etc." After investigation, the roads, Zhou gates and households in our factory are extremely wide, and have been approved by the concession engineering bureau and the fire brigade, pointing out that they meet the factory building. The narrow door and so on in your newspaper are probably rumors. For this reason, please correct it. Sincerely, Shanghai Guangdong Brothers Rubber Manufacturing Company General Distributor, November 28.</p>

<h3>No Point in Discussing What's Done</h3>
<p>— 19</p>
<p>"No point in discussing what's done" is a sage's teaching. This saying has been deeply rooted in people's hearts for thousands of years. Leaving aside other matters, preventing fights is a common example. Ah Mao from the Zhang family got beaten up by Zhao Di from the Li family. Naturally, Ah Mao would run back with snot and tears to tell his mother. What would his mother do? She would inevitably feel sorry for him, but thinking of "golden neighbors, silver relatives," she would have to suppress her anger. Moreover, the two families were neighbors, always visiting each other. Mrs. Li went to the market with her every morning and visited the Great World entertainment center every night. Could they fall out over such a small matter? Even Ah Mao's father, returning from his foreign firm and learning of this, would praise his wife's ability to maintain overall harmony. The reason is that the fight has already happened. Since it's a done deal, even scolding is useless. It's better to let it go and avoid hurting the relationship. This is the result of the sage's teachings deeply rooted in people's hearts.</p>
<p>"Moderation and Harmony" are the foundation of cultivating oneself, managing one's family, governing the state, and bringing peace to the world in our country. "Moderation is the universal path; harmony is the great foundation of the world." This is an indirect sage's teaching. "Moderation and Harmony" have such great power, so China has been able to turn danger into safety and safety into danger, not least because the people possess this virtue. This may seem to drift further and further away, but if one carefully examines the meaning of "no point in discussing what's done," doesn't it conform to "moderation" and "harmony"? How do foreign mothers deal with their children fighting? I haven't had the good fortune to marry a foreign wife, nor have I been abroad, so I dare not make assumptions. However, the virtues of foreigners can never match the moderation and harmony of our people. Based on this, perhaps the mother of a foreign "Ah Mao" would not let it go. To us Chinese, this would be criticizing them for not knowing the big picture. But we must forgive them because they have never read the sage's teaching of "no point in discussing what's done."</p>
<h3>Some Thoughts</h3>
<p>— Qian Jian</p>
<p>On the bustling Jing'an Temple Road, motorcycles sped by like lightning, constantly moving. The rumbling trams crawled along the tracks, going back and forth. And the intense sounds of motor vehicles and bicycles, the horns of motorcycles, and the noise of various sounds showed full joy, pleasure, and prosperity.</p>
<p>On one side of the sidewalk, a black door was lazily half-open. Walking from the door to the inside, two rows of tall maple trees, blown by the autumn wind, screamed wildly, their leaves flying piece by piece onto the pavement and the cemetery with crosses. And the amiable god of love, with a long leaf in his hand, did show unusual depression, loneliness, and coldness. || It turned out that this was the site of a foreign cemetery. Crosses were scattered everywhere, standing unevenly. At the same time, various colorful flowers also caught the eye: this has already proven that they (or she/they) are silent and have passed away.</p>
<p>In one corner, marble and iron railings surrounded his perimeter, the stone emitting a bright reflection. The god of love amiably stood by his side. On the tombstone, lines of gold letters were engraved, listing his life's history, the dates of his death, and the age he enjoyed. Moreover, a magnetic photo of his plump face and昂昻气概 was embedded on the tombstone. And beautiful flowers were placed before his spirit, emitting a rich fragrance to comfort his soul; lush trees surrounded his perimeter, releasing fresh air, as if to comfort his body and mind. Alas! How glorious they are!</p>
<p>In another corner, only a black wooden cross stood askew, the grave overgrown with weeds and withered grass, covered with fragments of broken bottles and scattered tiles. Even a clump of grass indicated the resting place of the deceased's soul. Alas! How lonely and desolate they are!</p>
<p>From this, we can imagine the glory and pleasure of the deceased's life from the exquisite equipment on the grave. At the same time, if there is only a desolate grave as the resting place for the ghost, then we can also imagine the poverty and suffering of the deceased before.</p>
<p>Alas! The glorious are glorious and enjoy themselves after death; the poor are poor and suffer after death.</p>
<p>Alas! If there is a soul after death, then the generally dead poor may have to weep bitterly!</p>
<h3>Believe it or Not</h3>
<p>— Jin Jia</p>
<p>Generally speaking, those who achieve great things in the world are often not the darlings of the goddess of fortune, but rather those "without opportunity," the poor children.</p>
<p>The extent of your achievement will never exceed the extent of your self-confidence.</p>
<p>The refinement or coarseness, superiority or inferiority of your conversation best reveals your level of education and social worth.</p>
<p>Economic distress, business failure, and difficult living are when "real people" make the greatest progress.</p>
<p>If a person often thinks that they are not capable enough to succeed, then there is no reason for them to succeed.</p>
<h3>Starting from Fearing One's Wife</h3>
<p>— Lian Lian</p>
<p>Generally, a person develops a fear of something or a situation because the other party has the motivation to be feared and threatened. Whether or not the fear will inevitably occur depends on one's courage and bravery. However, it is said that there are very, very few men who marry a wife and are not afraid of her.</p>
<p>I have many classmates who, before they got married, were fully heroic youths. Whether they said a word or did something, they were always high-spirited, intense, and self-centered. When they occasionally talked about women, they smiled dismissively, as if they were unworthy of study. As for saying that men are afraid of their wives, they didn't believe it one hundred and twenty percent. They would say, "What are we men afraid of? Are we worthy of being great men if we cower before women?" Their words were certainly beautiful and straightforward, but after they got married, when I asked them again, they were all silent. They didn't say anything more, just said faintly: "How many men in the world are not afraid of their wives?"</p>
<p>Originally, heroes have difficulty getting past the beauty trap. The ancients had already said this. But I don't know how Napoleon in the past and Hitler today treated their wives in foreign countries.</p>
<p>"Hedong Lion's Roar" is originally the tone used by those who fear their wives to describe the wife's mighty power. The lion is the king of beasts, and its subjugation of the wolves is only in one roar. However, comparing one's wife to a lion and willingly becoming a follower completely exposes one's pitiful and laughable attitude.</p>
<p>But speaking seriously, under the current atmosphere of high Chinese women's rights, a woman who can recognize her own position and rise up to do something great has a better chance and hope of success than a man. The lion symbolizes China. If the lion can wake up and roar, there may be hope for the future. But it sleeps soundly, without any consciousness. As for the Hedong Lion, it only roars in the house. So-called women's rights are only like this. To be like Lin Yutang's so-called "let the women do it for a while," then the Hedong Lion should turn around, step out of the house, and roar once.</p>
<h3>Frost-Bitten Vegetables</h3>
<p>— Jin Yang</p>
<p>These days, the Old Zhengxing Restaurant must be serving stir-fried vegetable hearts! Whether stir-fried with sliced meat, stir-fried with dried shrimp... or even just simply stir-fried in oil, I think everyone will praise the long taste of this vegetable heart.</p>
<p>Vegetables only gradually become delicious after the Beginning of Winter because frost has begun to be blown down to the ground by the gusty cold wind. It enters the heart of the vegetable, it covers the leaves of the vegetable. Vegetables that have been frost-bitten are glutinous and sweet.</p>
<p>Frost is universally spread over everything on the ground. It beats the vegetables and also beats people!</p>
<p>Those night workers who can't go home until three or four in the morning every night; those men and women factory workers who walk in groups of three or five every day before the moon has set, or huddle in piles on single-wheeled carts, pushing and running from the slums hidden in another corner of the city to the chimneys of the factories, working harder than "working at sunrise"; they are all accustomed to being ravaged by wind and rain, and are "bitter" sufferers of frost and dew:</p>
<p>Their feelings are certainly not as sensitive as our poets, but they have not been completely numb, right? What kind of emotions should surge in each of their simple minds, in each of their weak hearts? In the late night of early winter when the wind is tight and the frost and dew are heavy! At the dawn of early winter!</p>
<p>Correction: In the Sunday "Crab Special" "Crab Legs" article, the 17th line "Poet Chen Guimeng" should be corrected because "Chen" is a mistake for "Lu". We hereby correct it.</p>
<h3>Fourth Company Commander of the Northeast</h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 19: Desiring to Leave and Desiring to Stay, Remembering Past Events in the Same Car; Half Crying and Half Smiling, Leaning on the Pillow, Sick in Late Autumn</p>
<p>When she got into the car, she thought that Ji Zhi was just an old neighbor, how could she shake hands with him in front of so many people? Fortunately, there wasn't a single acquaintance on the bus, otherwise, what would happen if this got back to Haidian? Her heart pounded at this thought. But how could Ji Zhi understand this reason? The seats in this bus were two long planks attached to the walls on both sides. People with tickets crowded onto the bus, and the seats were already so packed that there wasn't any space. Ji Zhi had prepared for this move, sitting diagonally, stretching out his legs, occupying some space on the bench. Gui Zhi stood in the middle of the car, at a loss. Ji Zhi quickly sat down, squeezing hard, and making a small space in the corner of the car. He patted it with his hand and said, "Sit down, sit down!" Gui Zhi had no choice standing there. When someone offered her a seat, how could she not sit down? She had to squeeze in and sit down. But just as she sat down, a thought immediately arose in her mind? Even when she and Ji Zhi were very close, they had never sat together like this. Now that she was a married woman, she was sitting so close to him, wasn't this an unexpected thing? Maybe he was deliberately setting a trap, she couldn't fall for it. But she was already sitting down, and there was no reason to stand up. Otherwise, for such a long journey, she would have a seat and not sit, standing in the car, wouldn't people say she was crazy? So she turned her body to the side, facing away from Ji Zhi. The car started, and the people on the car began to talk. In Ji Zhi's heart, he was thinking that he had never sat so close to Gui Zhi, shoulder to shoulder, in the days when they were closest. Now, she had a hidden fragrance of powder on her body, sending it to people's noses faintly. After smelling it, there was an inexplicable sense of pleasure (252)</p>
<p>Character Sketches</p>
<p>— Jin Zi</p>
<h3>Lawyer Zheng's Wine</h3>
<p>Wine is truly something enjoyed by both the refined and the vulgar, and it has traces since the beginning of history. If we look at the biographies of various countries, we can easily find many "wine" characters and many "drunk" characters that are most closely related to wine. After the Qin and Han dynasties, the power of wine expanded even more. People like Chun Yukun and Liu Ling became famous throughout the world for their ability to drink, and their names were passed down through the ages. Their exemplary virtues and reputations are still remembered by a group of drunkards. There were also those friends who could write, such as Li Taibai and Ouyang Xiu, who complemented each other because they could both write and drink good wine, enjoying great fame for thousands of years. However, they were indeed flattered by the wine and benefited a lot. But the wine also owes it to them for promoting it like this, immediately raising its value, so that the famous scholars of later generations knew that wine could be drunk and would not be prohibited by moralists. By the Republic of China, there were the elegant stories of Mr. Luo Wengan and Mr. Zheng Tianxi, both serving as Ministers of Justice, and both fond of Huadiao and Brandy.</p>
<p>I don't know how much Mr. Luo Wengan could drink, or how addicted he was to wine, so I dare not boast on his behalf. But I heard that Mr. Luo had eye disease last time, his eyes were all red. The doctor taught him not to drink wine again, but he only kept the fast for half a day, and in the evening, he still poured down large bowls and pots as usual. From this, we can see a glimpse of it. Now, let's get back to the main topic and talk about Mr. Zheng Tianxi alone. Mr. Zheng is a big fat man who used to be a lawyer in Shanghai. It is said that no matter how busy he was with legal affairs, he had to drink after six o'clock in the afternoon. He would no longer consult about anything, but just sip and sip slowly until he rested in the evening. But he had three admirable good habits about how he liked to drink: First, he never drank himself drunk; second, he would not drink foreign wine unless he had to; third, he never drank more than the fixed amount every day; because even though he spent time with wine every day, he never lost his temper.</p>
<p>Mr. Zheng had a very strong ability to distinguish wine. He knew whether it was good or bad as soon as he tasted it. Because he was a regular customer of Wang Baohe, he once obtained the permission of the owner to try each type of wine in their store. At the end of the tasting, Mr. Zheng pointed out that a certain wine was really a priceless treasure. The owner was overjoyed when he heard this. He said that Mr. Zheng was really a person who could drink wine and was worthy of drinking this kind of wine. From that day on, he informed the waiter that whenever Mr. Zheng went to drink, he was allowed to provide him with that special wine. At that time, Mr. Zheng was still working as a lawyer, so the owner and the waiter called that wine "Lawyer Zheng's Wine" to commemorate it.</p>
<h3>Director Huang's Meal</h3>
<p>Eating is the only big thing and the only common thing in life, what is so rare about it. But the eating of Mr. Huang Boqiao, the current director of the Beijing-Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Bureau, is really not a normal thing, how can it not be recorded.</p>
<p>Director Huang suffered from diabetes several years ago, not only was he hopeless to have children, but he was also externally strong but internally weak, and he would lie down at any time. So he listened to the doctor's advice and implemented qualitative and quantitative eating. The so-called qualitative is to specify the nature of the food. What he stipulated were a few very simple types: The first was black bread (also known as bran bread) with a little butter; the second was yellow rice. The dishes emphasized liquids, and he didn't eat anything that was too fresh, nor did he eat anything that was too starchy, and he only ate a very few kinds. As for the quantitative, it was to specify the amount of bread and rice to be eaten. Therefore, whether he invited people to dinner himself or people invited him to dinner, all he needed was a basin of soup. When it was time to eat, he first said "please", and then took out two or three pieces of black bread that his wife had weighed and cut into pieces and wrapped in white paper from his pocket, and chewed them slowly. If he was at home, then what he ate would definitely be yellow rice that was also grown by his wife, and he probably wouldn't eat even one extra grain.</p>
<p>It is said that he has been implementing the above situation for five or six years, and although his diabetes has not been completely cured, his spirit is indeed better than before.</p>

<h3>Educational News: The Ministry of Education Orders Universities and Colleges to Accept Students from Ningxia Without Examinations</h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 28th) The Ministry of Education, according to the Ningxia Provincial Department of Education, requested an order to all universities and colleges to accept one to three students from the province each year without examinations. In addition to approving the department to submit a document before the start of each school term, a special order was issued to the presidents of all universities and specialized colleges to handle it in accordance with Articles 3 and 4 of the Regulations on the Treatment of Mongolian Students.</p>
<h3>Student Unrest Erupts Again at Shandong First High School: Students Unite to Expel Sun Weiyue, Banners and Leaflets are Bizarre</h3>
<p>(Jinan Correspondence) In recent years, education in this province has been straightened out, educational funding is never in arrears, and normal education, secondary education, vocational education, and rural education are all thriving. However, the provincial First High School has experienced repeated student unrest in the past two years, causing social criticism. Last year, the Department of Education, under orders, held the first entrance examination. Senior high school students and students of the school took the lead in opposing it. Principal Sun Weiyue was not good at handling it, which led to the expansion of the student unrest and even resulted in the absurd drama of beating the provincial supervisor Ma Rumei. Fortunately, the Department of Education decisively put down the unrest. For the past year, Sun has been derelict in his duties as before, and the head of the education department Hu Ganqing and the head of student affairs Wang Xintang have colluded with Sun, which has made the students even more dissatisfied. Thus, they brewed a student movement to expel Sun. Yesterday was Saturday, and due to a certain incident, the student unrest suddenly broke out. Numerous banners and leaflets were found throughout the school, with the words "Down with Sun Dongsheng (Sun Weiyue's nickname)", "Hu Ganqing", "Wang Xintang", and various bizarre terms such as "Expel the Bastard Sun Dongsheng". Some teachers left the school when they saw the sudden outbreak of student unrest. Therefore, yesterday passed hastily in a disorganized manner. It is not yet known whether classes will be held tomorrow, which is a holiday. It is faintly heard that the students are determined to expel Sun and will not stop until they achieve their goal.</p>

<h3>Overview of the Chinese Institute of the University of Paris</h3>
<p>Liu Hou, the Chinese government representative of the Chinese Institute of the University of Paris, recently reported the overview of the Chinese Institute of the University of Paris to the Chinese Ministry of Education. The original report is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) History In the autumn of the eighth year of the Republic of China, Mr. Wu Zhihui published a proposal for overseas emigration, advocating that the funds for establishing universities in the country should be transferred to establish universities overseas, so that the country's universities could create teachers in a better environment. Mr. Li Shizeng and Wang Jingwei were in France at the time and immediately agreed with his statement, which led to the establishment of the Sino-French Institute of the University of Lyon. At the same time, Mr. Ye Gongchuo was investigating in Europe and wanted to spread Oriental culture to France. He planned to have the Ministry of Communications fund the establishment of a Chinese Institute within the University of Paris, where Chinese academics would teach French people. Together with Mr. Han Rujia, he consulted Mr. Ban Lewei, the former Prime Minister of France, a scholar and statesman, on this idea. Mr. Ban strongly agreed and agreed to preside over the matter. On March 22, in the ninth year of the Republic of China, a society was established called the Chinese Institute. Its purposes were fivefold: (1) to help organize a mechanism for studying new and old advanced Chinese knowledge within the University of Paris, (1) to establish a Chinese library, and to train Chinese library specialists and translators, (3) to organize and encourage all Chinese-French institutions that can enable French people to study advanced Chinese knowledge, or Chinese people to study advanced French knowledge, (4) to assist in the establishment of the Chinese Academy of Sciences Academie Chinoise Des Sciences as a supplement to the old Chinese "Academy" and the preparation for the development of Western science in China, (5) to publish various publications, organize various special research associations and lectures, and issue prizes and subsidies. This society was recognized by the French government on December 12, in the tenth year of the Republic of China, and was affiliated with the University of Paris on March 17, in the eighteenth year of the Republic of China, and was named the Chinese Institute of the University of Paris.

<h3>Students of Gongshi Middle School Transferred to Qiaoguang Middle School and Daozhong Women's Elementary School Free of Charge</h3>
<p>The private Gongshi Middle School in this city was originally founded by Mrs. Cai Gongshi in memory of her late husband's martyrdom. It was first located on Shanzhong Road and later moved to Wangjiasha Garden Lane on Kader Road. However, from the beginning of the school's operation, the person in charge was not the right one, and the results were not good. In June of this year, it was closed by the court due to debt relations. Although Professor Huang Shenzhi of Jida University took over the school, it was impossible to rectify it due to the school's long-standing habits. The Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau has submitted a request to the Municipal Government to order the school to be closed and order students to transfer to nearby Qiaoguang Middle School and Daozhong Women's Elementary School. After passing the entrance examination, they will be placed in the appropriate grade. If they pass the examination, they will first be considered as auditors, and after passing the winter vacation examination, they will be officially enrolled. All tuition and miscellaneous fees for this semester will be temporarily waived, but board and lodging fees will be paid monthly according to regulations.</p>
<h3>Recent Status of Qinghua Primary and Secondary School</h3>
<p>Qinghua Primary and Secondary School in Zhangjiabang, Racecourse, has been established for seven years and has been highly praised by people from all walks of life.

Recently, it was heard that the school had hired Zheng Hongnian, a leader in the education field and president of Jinan University, as a school director. In the future, with Mr. Zheng Hongnian's enthusiastic promotion and encouragement, the development of school affairs will be even faster. Therefore, all students of the school are scheduled to hold a grand amusement fair on December 3rd to welcome Director Zheng. At the same time, a parent-teacher conference will be held, with programs such as national martial arts, dramas, magic, and chemistry demonstrations. Moreover, the school's vibrant scouts will maintain order on the scene to show solemnity.</p>
<h3>Grand Opening of the Shanghai Yancheng Huiling Alumni Branch</h3>
<p>There are quite a few alumni of Yancheng and Huiling Middle Schools in Suzhou living in Shanghai. Because there are few opportunities to contact each other on weekdays, they initiated the organization of the Shanghai Yancheng Huiling Alumni Branch. The association has been preparing for a long time and finally held its inaugural meeting at the Shanghai University Alumni Association in the Continental Commercial Building last Sunday afternoon. More than 80 people attended that day, including Yancheng Principal Chen Zichu, Huiling Principal Wang Meie, and alumni. The meeting was held as scheduled, and the association's charter was adopted, and Dai Yizhang, Zhang Chunjiang, and others were elected as executive committee members. The founders of the two schools and Principals Chen and Wang delivered speeches. A dinner was held that evening to celebrate the establishment of the association and to welcome the principals of the two schools who came to Shanghai from afar to participate. Teachers and friends gathered together in a very lively atmosphere.</p>
<h3>Jie Ru Elementary School Expands School Buildings</h3>
<p>Jie Ru Elementary School on Ganshidong Road in the French Concession was founded by Ms. Tang Jieru. It has been seven years since its establishment, and the school's affairs have been developing rapidly. The students' self-government has the organization of the municipal government. The library has added a collection of children's literature and other books, and there are wall newspaper groups, ping-pong teams, small football teams, and speech competitions, with experts to guide them. The kindergarten students have added seesaws and other sports equipment, so the school buildings have long been insufficient. As a result, a new school building has been added opposite the school building to be used exclusively as a classroom. A part of the original school building has been divided into dormitories. It is heard that the school plans to recruit boarding students starting next semester.</p>

<h3>Argentina Builds Great Sports Field to Prepare for World Games</h3>
<p>Twelfth Session May Be Held in Argentina</p>
<p>(Reuters, Buenos Aires, November 27) Buenos Aires is preparing for the World Olympic Games to be held in Argentina in the future. After the government approves the Argentine currency of 6 million (equivalent to £470,000), the construction of the national sports field will begin immediately. This field can accommodate 100,000 seats and has large-scale track and field events and international football games. The law for the construction of the sports field was passed in 1921, but its final construction plan has only recently been approved. The track of the athletic field is half a mile.</p>
<p>The future World Olympic Games, or the twelfth session, may be held here if it is in Argentina.</p>
<h3>The Third Public Exhibition Cup Day 1: Chinese Occupy Advantage; Win 4-1 Against Westerners; Hope for Revenge in This Session</h3>
<p>Yesterday at 6:00 PM, the third International Handball Competition Public Exhibition Cup opened in Xiqing. Dozens of Chinese and Westerners went to watch. The Chinese team was still represented by the Chinese Youth Team in this session. In the five singles matches, they won four games and scored four points. Although the Western team was very strong, it was only because the Chinese team was determined to avenge their shame and practiced hard on weekdays that they were able to win the first battle. If they continue to work hard today, there is great hope for winning the championship in this session.</p>
<p>Zhu Kuan, a national player in the first group, lived up to his name, winning two games in a row, 21-8 and 21-14, with a calm attitude and easy demeanor. The opponent, Mr. Cha, is known as the champion of Xiqing for his fierce right-handed kills, but once they played, the difference was immediately apparent. Zhu Kuan's superb skills won full applause, and Mr. Cha, defeated by a hero, was also completely convinced and regarded him as the only strong enemy in his life.</p>
<p>Sun Daosheng vs. Maluf in the third group, one Chinese and one Westerner, both have a long history of more than ten years. Mr. Sun can kill with both left and right hands, and his strategy is his strong point, but his strength is insufficient. Mr. Ma is good at long battles and knows the terrain well, but his right hand is not as good as his left hand. He lost two games in a row without any resistance because his weakness was discovered by Mr. Sun early on, and he used his mind to attack people's weaknesses and control the overall situation to defeat the strong enemy. Some say that this is Mr. Sun's best work in recent years.</p>
<p>Hong Rulin, a handsome young man in the fifth group, is known for his agility. His opponent, Bukins, is his strong enemy in previous sessions. This time they met again, and Mr. Hong fought bravely with a determination to die. Although he lost the first game, the difference was still close. The second game was completely in Mr. Bu's hands, and the score difference was very large. Mr. Bu was once a champion, but now he is in fifth place due to his age. His art is still beyond the reach of ordinary people.</p>
<p>Yan Zhaorong in the seventh group is full of strength and good at killing. In the current Chinese Youth Team members' ranking competition, he is the only person who has broken into the top ten and is still making rapid progress. Yesterday's victory over Hill was like taking something out of a bag, and there was nothing to worry about.</p>
<p>Lu Mengsheng in the ninth group won 2-1 against Weite. The failure in the first game was due to carelessness. In the second game, Mr. Lu used both left and right hands as he wished, and the third game was even more wild and unparalleled in sharpness, because his talent was indeed above the opponent's.</p>

<h3>Last Night's Xiqing Basketball: John Loses to Nanxing [43 to 24]; Dongwu Wins Against Junior in Group B 42 to 13</h3>
<p>Last night's important program in Xiqing Basketball was the battle between Nanxing and John. Nanxing's basketball skills are improving day by day. The passing and connection and shooting are wonderful. Bao Xindi, Zhou Nu'an, and Liu Jingfeng are particularly outstanding. John is a rising force, full of vigor, but unfortunately, within five minutes of the start of the game, the main player Cheng Jingxing was injured and left the field, greatly reducing his strength, causing him to be defeated by Nanxing with 43 to 24. Also, in Group B, Dongwu vs. Junior, there was nothing artistic to speak of. Dongwu won 42 to 13.</p>
<p>Dongwu Wins Junior (Group B) The game started at 7:30. Junior lived up to its name, and its basketball skills were mediocre. Dongwu controlled the situation with ease and was sure to win. However, the situation was chaotic, the advance and retreat were disordered, and the frequent changes of personnel made the game slow and uninteresting. The first half was 19 to 6, and the final result was 42 to 13. Dongwu won.</p>

<p>Nanxing Wins John (Group A) At the start of the game, Nanxing's forwards immediately launched their activities. Zhou Nu'an and Bao Xindi were like brothers, and their minds and hands corresponded very well. They scored six points in an instant. John tried to resist, but unexpectedly Cheng Jingxing was seriously injured and left the field suddenly, replaced by Zhang Yuanji. The morale was greatly reduced. After Tao Zunan returned a goal, Nanxing surrounded the two generals and shot one after another, like a string of beads. John's lineup was scattered and helpless. In addition, Nanxing's Liu Jingfeng and others were strictly guarded, and there was no gap to take advantage of. In the first half, Nanxing scored ten points each by Bao and Zhou, and John only had five points. In the midst of another battle, John's momentum was fierce. Zhou Xuexian and Ma Fangcui were very active. Wu Youliang and Tao Zunan made meritorious service in protecting them. Although Nanxing was brave, they did not dare to act rashly, and they stood on an equal footing, with mutual gains and losses. The situation was extremely tense, and the situation turned to equilibrium, and John even took the lead at one point, reaching 31 to 21. John was only ten points behind, but from then on, Nanxing's sharpness became stronger again. The passing and shooting of the two forwards was wonderful, making John take care of one thing and lose sight of another, and was exhausted. In the end, Nanxing won 43 to 24. Bao Xindi and Zhou Nu'an each scored 18 points and were the two major contributors to Nanxing.</p>

<h3>Jiangnan Track and Field Team Issues Challenge to Baihong</h3>
<p>The Jiangnan Track and Field Team, in preparation for the Far Eastern Games to be held in the Philippines next year, plans to continue to practice hard this winter. This is to issue a challenge to Baihong, proposing to have a confrontational competition this Saturday (please Baihong determine the location) so that both sides can practice. Baihong had a triangular competition with the Japanese and Russian overseas Chinese last week, and they were very interested, but the Japanese and Russian overseas Chinese lacked strong players, forming a one-sided situation, making Baihong's strong players have no place to use their heroism. Now that there is this opportunity, they should be happy and excited. Therefore, there will be another track and field competition this Saturday to visit.</p>
<h3>Ziyan Cup Ping Pong Semifinals Tonight</h3>
<p>The Ziyan Cup Ping Pong Tournament, which has been held for several days without a final decision, now needs to be replayed because the four teams have wins and losses and the scores are equal. Starting at 7:00 PM tonight, the semifinals will still be held in the Jian De Savings Association Ping Pong Room. In order to limit the number of people, temporary admission tickets are available, each for two cents. No tickets will be sold when full. We hope that everyone who comes to visit will come early. The reason for selling tickets for this cup is really a last resort. According to the situation of the first day of the semi-finals, when no tickets were sold, the audience was piled high, which really hindered the progress of the competition and was very dangerous. We hope that all sectors will forgive us. The amount of ticket revenue will be donated to the Jian De Savings Association. The replay sequence for this week is listed below:</p>
<p>(November 29th) Zexin vs. Guangdong, (December 1st) Post Office A vs. Zexin, (December 2nd) Guangdong vs. Zhongzao.</p>
<h3>Quanhei Basketball Works Hard to Beat Baiguang</h3>
<p>The Quanhei and Baiguang basketball teams had a friendly match at the Zhonghua Basketball Hall the night before. The Sunlight team is the essence of the Dongya Institute of Physical Education, with tall bodies and great strength. The Quanhei team is short and sharp and is the best among amateur teams. Therefore, hundreds of people came to watch, attracted by their reputation. At 7:30, Mr. Wang Huating served as the referee. At the sound of the silver whistle, Baiguang passed the ball three times, and Zhang Fangmei opened the scoring first. Soon, Ling Shunkun returned the favor. Afterwards, Quanhei used short passes, and Qu Xilin frequently appeared in the enemy's camp, causing Baiguang to be timid and make mistakes from time to time. In the first half, they were 12 to 16 behind. After the lemon, Baiguang had the opportunity to make it 20 to 23, but Quanhei was by no means weak. Jia Youliang and Zhou Zhi and others had excellent performances, making Baiguang unable to exceed their abilities. As a result, they lost 30 to 38. It is heard that this game was Qu Xilin's last battle in Shanghai, so it was nothing less than a farewell memorial to Quanhei and Qu's parting. Quanhei Position Foul Baiguang Position Foul</p>

<h3>Special Article: A General Overview of Modern Chinese Educational Thought (9) - Lecture by Shu Xincheng, Notes by Sun Yucai: Thoughts on Women's Education</h3>
<p>Thoughts on women's education occupy a considerable position in the entire history of educational thought. Currently, we can only temporarily discuss several names related to its evolution. Detailed information requires consulting specialized works. These include: the "Good Mother, Wise Wife" educational ideology, the female national education ideology, gender equality education, and women's education. Although there have been many variations in the thoughts on women's education over the past thirty years, they can be broadly divided into the four main strands mentioned above. The emergence of these four ideologies is not accidental; they share common causes and specific backgrounds. The former arises from changes in social organization, while the latter is driven by the agitation of family values, national ideologies, human rights principles, and scientific thought. However, for women's education to develop in the same way as men's education, it is still necessary to adhere to the scientific principles of women's education and make special efforts.</p>
<h3>New Paths in Education Going Forward</h3>
<p>To determine the direction of Chinese educational thought going forward, first, it must be understood that education is a part of human activity and cannot be separated from other activities. The ideals and realities of society, politics, and economics all play a role in governing education. Therefore, the reform of education is not simply an educational problem but involves social, political, and economic factors. Although we are focusing on studying educational problems here, we must not hold preconceived notions and assume that education is all-powerful or ineffective. What we should pay attention to is the fact that education is a part of human activity. While it cannot be separated from other activities, its reform also affects those other activities. Therefore, to indicate future paths for education, we should clearly understand the situation in society, politics, and economics and establish a clear path to achieve our goals. Secondly, China's current situation is very special. Global trends are pushing it towards an industrial and commercial system from all sides, but its old organizational structures are hindering its progress due to transportation obstacles and the rampant presence of soldiers and bandits. In this transitional period, neither the old nor the new can be fully adopted; a new path must be developed by considering both.</p>
<p>Currently, China's politics are not on track, society is plagued by soldiers and bandits, lacking order and organization, and the economy is on the verge of bankruptcy. The phenomenon of a divided social life remains unchanged. There are two main reasons why China has reached this point: first, the oppression of the great powers; second, the population has been poisoned by the Confucian political thought of "not holding a position, not planning its policies" regarding national affairs.</p>
<p>Since the "September 18th Incident," the so-called justice and peace in the international community have been shown to be untrustworthy. Since the Lausanne Conference and the disarmament conference yielded no results, it has become clear that the so-called great powers have no economic way out, and war is inevitable. The success of the Soviet Union's Five-Year Plan has also reminded us of the greatness of economy and popular intelligence in building a nation. In the future, if we want the Republic of China to stand independently in the world and the Chinese nation to exist forever on the earth, we must work hard to strengthen ourselves and build our country. In the process of self-strengthening and construction, education will naturally show its importance as a tool.</p>
<p>Now that we understand the crux of China's problems, what are the new paths for education going forward? There are several, which I have already mentioned: 1. Production education; 2. Rural education; 3. Popular education; 4. National rejuvenation education.</p>
<p>We deeply hope that our colleagues in the education field will work hard on production education, rural education, popular education, and national rejuvenation education. We also hope that educators will pay attention to politics, economics, and society outside of education to achieve coordination in education and jointly shoulder the responsibility of building the nation and the home, and revitalizing the nation.

<h3>Literary Life and Slavery</h3>
<p>— Tang Tao</p>
<p>From the beginning, making a living through writing has always been difficult. That's why when Barton (Bernad Barton) wanted to leave his bank job to devote himself to writing, Lamb (Charles Lamb) wrote to discourage him, telling him to sit safely in his bank office. The letter said something like this:</p>
<p>"If you rely on booksellers, squeezing your brains to exchange for a pot of ale and a few pieces of mutton, turning your free thoughts and lingering verses into commercial work, it's simply a slave's life, worse than any slave's life."</p>
<p>"Keep your bank; the bank will sustain you. Don't pay attention to worldly people. If you insist on the kind of status that gentlemen are concerned about, you will inevitably hang yourself, starve to death, or drown yourself."</p>
<p>Lamb first spoke of the hardships of a literary life, not as noble and leisurely as one might imagine. And trying to make a living this way always feels unreliable, so there's no need to give up your life to pursue the kind of status that worldly people are so concerned about. Although he said that a literary life is as difficult as slavery, it's not really slavery.</p>
<p>Chinese people hanging out signs to sell articles were rare in the past. But making a living by writing has "long been the case." To pass the imperial examination, become a successful candidate, and win the red and blue official hats, one had to be able to write a wonderful article "praising the sage's virtues" that would make the emperor "delighted." Then the wonderful article would be circulated, a good official position would be obtained, and the problem of livelihood would be solved.</p>
<p>In this way, the history of Chinese literature, as Mr. Yu Dafu said, has become a complete "history of slavery."</p>
<p>I'm afraid this kind of slavery is real, but it doesn't matter much. Because slavery in China is not as hateful as it is in foreign countries. China doesn't seem to have many Lambs. Traditional ideas tell us that being a slave with status is glorious and enjoyable; the problem is not about life. So if you try to stop others, you will inevitably offend them.</p>
<p>In recent times, signs for selling articles have been erected one after another. Life must still be lived, and we cannot persuade every writer to become an amateur, so writing articles and receiving royalties has been clearly stipulated and should not be "pursued." But the problem is naturally about life. If it's about enjoyment, glory, getting rich, being a slave with status, etc., outside of life, that's not covered by this rule.</p>
<p>But the ancient method should not be abolished after all. Slavery with status is "admired by all the world."</p>
<h3>Peking Opera Connoisseur</h3>
<p>— Sheng Fu</p>
<p>I don't often watch Peking Opera, but I'm not a follower of Mr. Liang Shuming, believing that I would feel uneasy inside if I saw Mei Lanfang once. Of course, it's not that I have a deeper understanding of art and look down on Peking Opera, so I don't want to go to the theater. The reason I don't often watch opera is that I don't have the leisure and lack the talent to be a Peking Opera connoisseur.</p>
<p>I admire Peking Opera connoisseurs very much. It is said that they can be roughly divided into three types:</p>
<p>One type cannot really be considered a "connoisseur." It refers to fools like me, who don't usually go to the theater. But when I occasionally visit, I'm a "play reader" in front of the stage, very concerned about the excitement on the stage. Who is playing Zhuge? What is her or his situation? And what kind of talented men and beauties are in the boxes? I don't even realize it, just watching the opera stupidly, one scene after another, and that's it.</p>
<p>Another type is a more profound connoisseur. Although they also sit in front of the stage, they rarely focus their eyes on the stage. We only see their activities: going up to the boxes for a while, going backstage for a while. They are busy enjoying "chewing gum" and "ice cream," and may even be holding a small publication. In short, they are busy and active, seemingly not watching the opera. However, they are more profound than you dull "readers." They can not only recite the plot and play the characters in the play, but also know all the secrets and private affairs of her or him; even those things that should not be told to others. Why are they so profound? Because they pay attention to the backstage, the actors, not the "play." They know that the "play" is not real, but just singing to deceive people to laugh and cry. After all, he is one level higher, and can doubly be called a connoisseur.</p>
<p>There is another type that I have only encountered in Beiping. These are connoisseurs who have entered samadhi. Their age is probably all "knowing destiny." They have thirty or forty years of connoisseurship history. Sometimes they have also acted in operas and taught students. Therefore, when they come to the theater, they simply don't need their eyes. We only see them sitting in the distant side boxes, closing their eyes and drinking "fragrant tea," sending their souls to another world with the curling sounds of the strings. They have truly entered samadhi. Of course, they don't go backstage or pay attention to the faces on the stage, but the theater boss never dares to offend them, because they have the authority to criticize. The words they say cannot be denied.</p>
<p>It is said that after Beijing was changed to Beiping, the market was sluggish. Recently, it was rumored that a new group of people in the Peking Opera troupes of Beiping went to the south to organize a stage, actively recruiting former famous actors and recruiting new younger generations, preparing to revive the past glory of Beijing Peking Opera. It is also said that the audience doesn't like to watch "The Substitute Prince," so this stage is preparing to stage some plays that suit the public's taste. In recent days, people who love Peking Opera in various places can't help but be a little moved, because the rumored repertoire is really too novel, and the distance from the old tunes is too far. I am a person with no connection to Peking Opera, and I don't want to criticize this new repertoire. I'm just wondering and worrying whether these famous actors who are famous for "The Substitute Prince" will still show the tail of the raccoon cat in this new play.</p>
<h3>On Li Houzhu</h3>
<p>— Yin Chuan</p>
<p>Anecdotes and stories about Li Yu, the Later Lord of Tang, are scattered in various records. If one puts in some effort to collect them, one can discover many important historical materials about him. From what I have seen and remember, in Kong Pingzhong's "Tan Yuan" of the Song Dynasty, it is recorded that Han Weigong had a painting of bamboo by Li Houzhu in his collection, saying that there were many inscriptions on it. Chen Meigong's "Pearl Boat" of the Ming Dynasty said, "Li Houzhu paid attention to writing instruments. The Chengxintang paper, Li Tinggui ink, and Longwei inkstone he used were the best in the world." Lu Youren's "Yanbei Magazine" said, "Yuan Bochang had a jade brush holder used by Li Houzhu, with engraved characters on it, the engraving being extremely fine." And another record in "Pearl Boat" simply mythologizes his anecdotes. The original record says:</p>
<p>Li Houzhu obtained a green stone inkstone. In the ink pool, there was a yellow stone like a pellet, the water was always full, and it was used all day without being depleted, and he always carried it with him. Later, when he returned to the court, Tao Gu saw it and was surprised. The inkstone was too big to hold, so he took the stone pellet away. Li Houzhu grabbed his hand and swung his arm onto the horse. Li Houzhu asked to thank him with treasures, but Tao refused. Li Houzhu said, "Only this inkstone can produce water, other inkstones cannot be used." Tao tried dozens of inkstones, but none produced water. Li Houzhu asked for it back very bitterly, but Tao could not bear to part with it and said, "I will have to break it." When the stone broke, a small fish jumped out of the ground and died. Since then, the inkstone has never been moist again.</p>
<p>These are all sufficient to help us understand Li Houzhu's life situation, although they cannot be said to be important materials. However, a note recorded in Yuan Qi of the Song Dynasty's "Maple Window Small Records" is extremely valuable, and it is a record of Li Houzhu's inscription. It is very difficult to find Li Houzhu's prose, and to suddenly obtain this article is like finding a treasure. The original record says:</p>
<p>I once saw a book in the inner library, "Jin Lou Zi," with a handwritten inscription by Li Houzhu saying, "Emperor Xiaoyuan of Liang said of Wang Zhongxuan, 'When I was in Jingzhou, I wrote dozens of books. When Jingzhou was destroyed, all the books were burned. Now there is one book left, which famous scholars all value. Seeing a hair of a tiger, one does not know its spots.' Later, when Western Wei broke Jiangling, the emperor also burned all the books, saying, 'The way of literature and martial arts ends tonight!' Why are the two phrases 'Jingzhou was destroyed and the books were burned' the same before and after?" He sighed in poetry: "Tens of thousands of axes of ivory tags are inside the red silk, Wang Can's books are also sent to the fire. If it were not for Emperor Zu Long leaving a face, how could the surviving chapters reach today?" The scrolls were all copied on Xue Tao paper, but "today" was mistakenly written as "Jin Dynasty." Emperor Huizong disliked it and erased it with a pen. Later, the book became a prophecy and entered the Jin Dynasty.</p>
<p>Li Houzhu's poetry and prose are all seen in this short note, and the fact that "today" was mistakenly written as "Jin Dynasty" can be said to be extremely clever. In "Yanbei Magazine," there are not only records about Li Houzhu, but also about Emperor Zhongzhu's portrait. One says that Li Boshi had a picture of Yadi, and Wang Mingqing determined that the person sitting upright was the portrait of Li Zhongzhu of the Southern Tang Dynasty. Another says, "Li Zhongzhu of Jiangnan, four brothers playing chess, the screen is written with Le Tian's poems, the colored figures on the paper are all lifelike." This painting is also related to Li Houzhu. Now I don't know where this painting has gone, or whether it is still in the world. Because I am recording Li Houzhu, I am also mentioning it.</p>
<h3>Poor Child</h3>
<p>— Xu Zhuanpeng</p>
<p>The mother had just coaxed her sick little brother to sleep when the seven-year-old child, who had been playing at the threshing ground early in the morning, came home flushed.</p>
<p>He stuck out his small, round, brown-blue eyes and said to his mother in a high-pitched voice:</p>
<p>"Mom, the beggar with the bamboo centipede is here again."</p>
<p>"Oh, that bewitching fellow. He'll kidnap children. Quickly close the door and hide in the corner..."</p>
<p>The mother put on a serious face and threatened him like this. She knew that when the child saw the beggar, he would want to buy his bamboo centipede and that would cost money.</p>
<p>The seven-year-old child already understood some things. He saw that all his companions liked the beggar and were happy when they saw him. They followed behind him, from street to street, from this alley to that alley, as if they didn't want to let him go... The beggar always smiled when he saw the children.</p>
<p>"Mom, you're lying to me. I want to buy a centipede to play with..." The child grabbed his mother's trouser leg and spun around her feet. He rolled around on the chicken-droppings-covered ground, trying to force his mother to give in by crying.</p>
<p>"I'll buy it next time. Mom doesn't have any money today."</p>
<p>The mother's gentle words were ineffective. The child's crying face would not turn into a smiling face until he got the centipede.</p>
<p>"Little Sanzi and Fifth Brother, they all bought one..."</p>
<p>"They are children from wealthy families. You can't compare to them... May you be reborn into a wealthy family in the next life..."</p>
<p>The seven-year-old child didn't understand his family's poverty, not even two copper coins to buy a box of matches! He only saw that his companions wanted one, so he wanted one too.</p>
<p>The beggar followed the children's cries, and at this moment, he was standing in front of her house.</p>
<p>"Buy one for the child to play with. Five copper coins is a small matter; it's a big deal if the child cries and hurts himself..."</p>
<p>Mothers with children all hated him, like a devil. When he came to the village, the children cried especially loudly.</p>
<p>"Go, go! No one wants to buy your centipede. Don't walk to my door. Next time, you're not allowed to come into our village..."</p>
<p>Even a storm of abuse couldn't drive him away. He still stood there, wanting to sell his wares.</p>
<p>The child saw that he couldn't get what he wanted and cried even more willfully.</p>
<p>"Okay, beggar, then I'll buy one from you. I don't have any money today. I'll bring it next time..."</p>
<p>"Hey! You want to owe the beggar money? Beggars who sell centipedes don't give credit..."</p>
<p>Then the beggar cast a contemptuous glance, spat on the ground, and walked to another house.</p>
<p>The mother, feeling wronged, vented her anger by hitting the child. At this moment, the mother wanted to use hitting to stop the child from crying.</p>
<p>"I wouldn't feel bad if I beat you to death, you little bastard... We don't even have enough to eat, where would we get the extra money to buy a centipede to play with..."</p>
<p>That day, the children in the village cried especially loudly, and many mothers beat their children...</p>
<h3>Two Brothers (43)</h3>
<p>— Guy de Maupassant, translated by Li Weike</p>
<p>Then he slowly reviewed all the conjectures that had made his heart ache last night on the embankment, amidst the sounds of the steam whistle. The more he thought about it, the more he felt that this matter was beyond doubt. He felt that he was being led by his own logic to that unpleasant fact, just like being led by a hand that dragged and strangled him.</p>
<p>He was thirsty, he was hot. His heart was pounding.</p>
<p>He stood up to open the window to breathe, but as he stood up, a slight sound came from the wall next door.</p>
<p>Jean was sleeping peacefully and snoring softly. He was sleeping, him! He had not anticipated anything, had not guessed anything! A man who knew their mother left all his property to him. He took the money, feeling that this was righteous and natural.</p>
<p>He was sleeping, rich and satisfied, but he didn't know that his brother was in torment. So Pierre felt a surge of anger towards this carefree, satisfied sleeper.</p>
<p>If it had been last night, he would have gone to knock on his door, walked in, and sat in front of his bed. He would have said to him, suddenly waking up and surprised, "Jean, you shouldn't accept this inheritance. It will make others suspect our mother and thus damage her reputation."</p>
<p>But today he could no longer speak. He couldn't tell Jean that he absolutely didn't believe he was their father's son. Now he had to keep this shameful discovery to himself, keep the secret in his heart. He had to hide the stain he had seen so that no one would notice, not even his brother, especially his brother.</p>
<p>He no longer thought about the irrelevant praise or slander of public opinion. He would rather everyone slander his mother, as long as he knew she was innocent, as long as he alone knew. How could he live with her every day, looking at her while thinking that she had conceived his brother under the caresses of a stranger? How could he endure this?</p>
<p>But how peaceful and cheerful she was, how innocent she seemed! Could a woman like her, a woman with a pure soul and a righteous heart, fall, be seduced by passion, and then not show any remorse, not show that she had ever been troubled by her conscience?</p>

<h3>Financial Matters: American Silver · Exchange Rates · Commodity Prices Downstream · Standard Gold Price Rebounds 14.6 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the gold market saw the price of American official gold remaining stable, while London spot gold plummeted one shilling, two pence and ten and a half farthings. This led to mainland China covering short positions, a sudden contraction in exchange rates, and a sharp drop in far-term silver prices at the Five Metals Exchange, falling by amounts ranging from 1.15 to 1.22 fen. American cotton fell 10 points, American wheat contracted by 0.875, and stocks fell by 3.51 yuan. The wool market opened at 17-18 yuan and gradually rose to over 20 yuan. After the opening, a Reuter's dispatch reported that commodity prices in America were falling, and that the Finance Department’s report indicated signs of financial stability, strengthening investor confidence and driving prices upward. However, due to bank closures and supplies from Sassoon &amp; Co., the domestic market hardened and prices stabilized again. Western merchant La Lai sold forward contracts, fluctuating around 20 yuan. The afternoon market opened flat. A Reuter's dispatch reported that a certain doctor in Colombia, America, was advocating for the restoration of the gold standard, causing another price increase. Ultimately, this dispatch had little impact, and the gold price retreated again. In the end, there were no special changes, and the market was quite stable. However, with supply trending toward abundance, the situation became more hesitant. Clam shell price was 1,100 yuan. Here is a record of the day’s market conditions:</p>
<p>The morning opening was 719.8 yuan, up 13 yuan from the previous close. Goods opened at 9.5 yuan. The foreign exchange market opened with spot selling prices of British exchange at one shilling, three pence and three-seventy-five farthings, and American exchange at 32.9375 yuan. Shun Mao supplied, retreating from 20.03 yuan to 19.1 yuan. Zhengjin continuously bought American dollars for February at 5.5625 yuan and 0.5 yuan, and March at 7.5 yuan. Da Decheng, Zhi Fengyong, Da Xingyong, Yi Fengyong and others continued to push prices up, reaching around 23 yuan. Yuan Maoyong and Tong Xingyong sold at under 2 yuan. However, with Hengyu entering and advancing again, it was known beforehand that HSBC was quoting British exchange at par and American exchange shrinking by 0.0625. The Dalian group, Tong Taichang, and Da Decheng continued to buy and push the price up to 3.8 yuan. Citibank covered American dollars for February at 0.375 and 0.125 for February. Hengyu and Hongli divested, retreating again to 1.5 yuan. Shortly thereafter, because Zhengjin picked up American dollars for March at 0.0625, Huixiang, Fuyu, Da Decheng and others bought heavily again, pushing the price up to 3.8 yuan. Hengxing then came up and sold aggressively, retreating to around 2.5 yuan. Anda ate American dollars for March at 0.0625. Da Decheng's appetite was still strong, and the situation remained stable. Under the force of Sassoon &amp; Co.'s covering, the domestic market hardened. Zhengjin sold to Hua Bi American dollars for March at 0.06875 and February at 0.04375. Sassoon wanted to cover but could not. Tong Taichang, Zhi Fengyong, and Shunli sold forward contracts one after another, dropping to 0.02 yuan. Although Hengxing advanced, Yuan Shengyong worked hard to sell forward contracts. Tong Taichang and Shunli continued to sell, and Hua Bi came out with American dollars for January at 0.025, breaking the 20 yuan mark and falling to 19.3 yuan. Da Decheng and Hengtai bought at the lower price, and then rose to 0.09 yuan. Hua Bi covered American dollars for February at 0.5 yuan and March at 0.08125. Yuan Shengyong and Hongli also sold, retreating again to 18.6 yuan. After fluctuating, the noon close was 719.5 yuan, and goods were auctioned at 19.7 yuan.</p>
<p>The afternoon market opened at 720 yuan, and goods opened at the same price. Although Bingxing and Tongyi advanced, Da Xingyong came to sell, struggling around 20 yuan. HSBC ate American dollars for February at 0.05625, revealing firmness. Because American dollars for March at 0.075 were difficult to settle, Bingxing, Yuan Maoyong, Hengyu, Tongyi, Tian Fengyong and others bought heavily, rising to 22.8 yuan. Datong covered American dollars for January at 0.01875. Zhengjin was cold to February at 0.04375 and 0.5 yuan. After the Dalian group, Hongli, and Yi Dayong divested, it dropped to 0.03 yuan. Goods buying was still able to rebound. Later, because Hengyu and Da Decheng sold heavily, it fell to 19.2 yuan. Hengxing came to advance, rising again. Hengyu also bought, rising to 21.2 yuan. Datong covered American dollars for January at 0.025. Wanxing supplied contracts, falling by 1 yuan. Because Tian Fengyong bought, investor confidence was unstable, rising again to 2.2 yuan. Maijia Li covered American dollars for March at 0.06875. Yuan Shengyong sold again, retreating to 0.05 yuan. Bingxing set a limit price to advance, and Hengtai also bought. The closing price was 721.4 yuan. Goods were auctioned at 0.08 yuan. Bingxing still advanced, and the closing was very flat. Examining the day's high and low, the highest was 723.8 yuan and the lowest was 718.6 yuan, a difference of 5.2 yuan. The result was an increase of 14.6 yuan from the previous close.</p>
<p>Because HSBC Bank's American exchange quotation shrank by 0.0625 to 32.375 yuan, the standard gold price was 741 yuan. According to the closing price, it was about 20 yuan less, not much different from the previous close. The registration price for this month was 734 yuan, December was 726 yuan, and January was 720 yuan. The morning make-up was 734 yuan, and the afternoon make-up was 735 yuan. The clam shell price retreated to 1,100 yuan due to the sharp drop in London spot gold. The highest price in the early market was 1,103 yuan, and the lowest was 1,100 yuan. The Tianjin group sold about 500-600 taels to counterparts. In the afternoon market, foreign groups continued to sell, lacking buyers. The Tianjin group sold 300 taels to Yingfeng Heng, dropping to 1,094 yuan. There were still 1,225 forward contracts remaining for this month and 4,508 contracts for December.</p>
<p>Trading in the market was quite flat. In summary, Shunli, Yuan Shengyong Fuchang, Hongxing Hengtai, Yuan Maoyong, Da Fayong, Yi Dayong, Yuanmao, Richang, Qian Changxiang, Shengda, and Hengxing were on the selling side. Bingxing, Ruikang, Da Xingyong, Yuan Xingyong, Da Decheng, Shenkang, Da Changxiang, Tong Taichang, and Tian Fengyong were on the buying side. Yi Fengyong, Hongli, and Da Xingyong advanced first and exited later. Tong Xingyong, Zhi Fengyong, and Hengyu exited first and advanced later. The Dalian group and Shunli jointly traded about 4,000, netting out over 600 contracts. Wanxing jointly traded over 3,000, netting out with little advance or exit. The Guangdong group Shengda sold over 100 contracts. Hengxing issued about 400 contracts and advanced over 300 contracts. The total number of chips for January was 22,645 contracts.</p>

Compared with the previous close, British exchange was loose by 0.0625, and American exchange was tight by 0.0625. After the opening, although the banks covered, they remained tight. HSBC's quotation revealed that British exchange was flat and American exchange shrank by 0.0625. At this time, it was very popular. Shortly thereafter, because Sassoon tended to supply, the situation returned to loosen again. The afternoon market fluctuated, and the process was slightly better. Western merchants Xiang Meng and Qiao Zhifu covered. By the closing, the spot selling prices of British exchange were one shilling, three pence and three-one-two-five farthings, and American exchange was 32.9375 yuan. Compared with the previous close, British exchange was flat and American exchange was tight by 0.0625. In the banking world, Zhengjin, Citibank, HSBC, Datong, Maijia Li and others all covered.

<h3>Banks Lack Clearing Funds · Call Loan Rates Suddenly Rise Sharply ·丨Actually Opening at 1.2 Fen丨</h3>
<p>Yesterday, call loan rates suddenly rose sharply. Both the morning and afternoon markets opened at 1.2 fen, which was 0.2 fen higher than the previous day. Clearing funds and overnight money were also quite high, with a rate of 1.34 fen, which was 0.12 fen better than the previous day. According to industry insiders, the end of the month was approaching, and banks lacked short positions. Fellow traders generally wanted to clear in, so the market price suddenly rose sharply. In the call loan bill market, morning transactions transferred over 5.2 million, and new transactions were over 600,000. Afternoon transactions were 4-500,000. Transactions in the small general association were over 700,000.

<h3>Securities: Government Bonds Show New Low Prices Again 丨Except for Reorganization Bonds丨</h3>
<p>Yesterday at the Chinese Commercial Securities Exchange, the situation in Fujian Province did not develop significantly. However, the situation in Fujian and Zhejiang appeared more serious. War clouds were gathering, and a storm seemed imminent. A war seemed unavoidable, and there were rumors that Commander Chiang would personally lead an expedition to quell it. The situation in Guangdong Province was markedly one of watching from the sidelines. In the government bond market, speculators were hypersensitive, and short selling started again. Market prices continued to plummet. All bonds, except for reorganization bonds, hit new lows. 1929 Customs Bonds were not traded and are not included in this situation. The future trend was unknown, but the prices of various bonds had largely retreated to nearly 50% of their face value. If investors were to start buying and trigger short covering, there might be a larger rebound. In the morning opening, retail investors sold the most, and northern traders slightly covered short positions. Market prices still fell by 0.1-0.5 yuan. After this setback, investor confidence became more depressed. In the secondary market, large traders also sold, but No. 53 bought and No. 38 also slightly covered. However, because there were more sellers, market prices could not be maintained and mostly fell another 0.3-0.4 yuan. Entire lot Six Bonds fell by 0.8 yuan, and two or three other types hit new lows. In the afternoon, only one round of trading was done. The situation on the trading floor remained weak, and bulls continued to exit. Nos. 11 and 53 bought quite a bit, but not as much as the selling by retail investors. Market prices fell another 0.3-0.6 yuan. In summary, the results for the day were declines of 1-1.35 yuan, with Entire lot Six Bonds falling by as much as 1.7 yuan. Based on their market prices, all bonds, except for reorganization bonds, had hit new lows. The situation was still not optimistic. The total trading volume was 15,274,000 yuan, including 4,000 yuan in cash and 6,460,000 yuan in futures, including 1,900,500 yuan in Unified Salt Tax Reorganization Bonds, 1,790,000 yuan in 1929 Customs Bonds, 2,580,000 yuan in 20 volume 20 Customs Bonds, 1,760,000 yuan in gold and Entire lot Six Bonds. The remainder ranged from over 100,000 to 2-300,000 yuan. Today is the settlement date for November futures, and the market is closed for one day.</p>
<h3>New York Stock Market Trades Slightly Active After a Sharp Fall</h3>
<p>A report from Xinfeng Foreign Firm on the 27th stated that the New York stock market had fallen sharply by 1-6 yuan, and trading was slightly active. This was because the US dollar rose sharply, perhaps due to European short covering. The reason why European shorts covered US dollars was because, based on recent developments, some believed that the US government might seek a new path for monetary policy. However, the reasons for this statement were insufficient. At the same time, the industrial and commercial sectors opposed expansion, strengthening the US dollar. It was generally expected that the government's fundraising in December could follow the usual path without encountering difficulties. In other words, there was no need to implement monetary inflation. The total daily trading volume was 1.56 million shares. The steel company reported that the steel workload was 26.8%. Silver fell by over 0.01 yuan, partly due to the increase in global silver production. "Wheat" bulls continued to close positions, and later rose due to government purchases of spot goods. "Cotton" trading was quiet, with small fluctuations. It fell due to the impact of exchange rates and the closing of long positions. Factories were the main buyers, and the technical position gradually improved. The price of gold purchased by the Financial Relief Agency was 33.76 yuan per tael and remained unchanged. The Dow Jones indices are listed below:</p>
<p>Closing Price　Compared to the Previous Day</p>
<p>30 Industrial Stocks　95.77　Down 3.51</p>
<p>20 Railroad Stocks　37.92　Down 1.62</p>
<p>20 Utility Stocks　23.73　Down 0.87</p>
<p>40 Bonds　80.25　Up 0.35</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cloth: Yarn Prices Could Not Be Maintained · Yesterday's Market Price Fell Sharply · Turning to Self-Preservation Amidst Irreversible Torrent</h3>
<p>The downward trend in the yarn market continued to advance. The situation was very weak. Due to the poor overseas business conditions and sluggish domestic demand, stockpiles were difficult to reduce. It was also heard that some parties who had previously maintained prices had released all their holdings, and that some had turned from long to short positions. As a result, the market price plummeted, and the near-term four-month period once broke through the 80 yuan mark.</p>
<h3>Cotton Futures Fall Again by One Yuan</h3>
<p>In the morning opening of cotton futures, the market atmosphere was still flat, and the selling trend was still strong. Each month fell by 0.3, 0.5, and 0.7 yuan. In the afternoon, the downward trend became stronger, with large bulls closing positions, and each month fell by 1.3, 0.5, and 0.6 yuan. The total daily trading volume was 62,900 bales. Rongxing sold 4,050 bales, Ruida sold 4,550 bales, Changyu sold 2,050 bales, Shenji sold 2,350 bales, Dachang sold 3,950 bales, Changfeng sold 1,450 bales, and Hengchang sold 1,800 bales.

<p>Total　221,050</p>
<h3>Yarn Sales Are Less Than 300 Bales</h3>
<p>The movement of current yarn is quite sluggish. Statistics show that all groups purchased only 280 bales throughout the day. The market price fell by over 0.05 yuan. The purchase amounts of each group are listed below:</p>
<p>Inland 206　Ningbo 7　Haizhou 5　Jiangxi 5</p>
<p>Northern 5　Guangdong 42　Changsha 5　Yunnan 5</p>
<h3>Although Cotton Prices Fell, They Were Still Better Than Cotton Yarn 丨Because the Base Is Exhausted丨</h3>
<p>The cotton market was still flat. Because general cotton merchants believed that its base had been exhausted, they bought and went long. The downward trend was not as severe as that in the yarn market. Overseas cotton markets trended lower, and sales of current cotton still failed to improve. Stockpiles in production areas continued to grow. Because yarn sales were not smooth, factories did not dare to process raw materials smoothly. In short, judging from the overall situation, the future was still bleak.</p>
<h3>Zhengzhou Standard Continues to Fall Slightly by 0.02 Yuan</h3>
<p>In the morning opening of Zhengzhou Standard, the market atmosphere was still rising. Due to bulls adding positions, each month only fell by 0.005 yuan.

<h3>American Cotton Prices Fall Again</h3>
<p>Yesterday's American cotton market situation fell due to a lack of major buyers, selling by foreign firms, and weakness on Wall Street. As a result, spot goods fell by 20 points, and futures fell by 20-24 points. Liverpool cotton spot goods fell by 4 points, and futures rose by 1-2 points. Egyptian cotton spot goods fell by 3 points. The Bombay cotton market fell due to the closing of long positions. As a result, Pingjiaer fell by 2.75 rupees, Aomula fell by 4.25 rupees, and Bailuoxi fell by 2.5 rupees.

<h3>Grains: Futures Flour Feared to Become a Trapped Situation</h3>
<p>After the flour market opened yesterday morning, the markets for each month were mostly stable. Because the quotation for foreign wheat continued to be small, Chicago was also small by 0.02 yuan, and Canada was small by 0.05-0.06 yuan. The opening price was good in sentiment, softer for the near term compared to the previous day, and stable for the far term. Because the number of sellers was scarce, the number of buyers increased, so the market atmosphere turned stable again. Until the afternoon opening, the situation for this month suddenly changed drastically. Because there were only one or two days left for trading, many outside bulls exited one after another. It was also heard that the returning warehouse receipts and the need to deliver on hedges required everyone to release their stocks, but the bulls did not have this strength, so they gradually fell, creating a situation where many bulls were killed. The far-term markets for each month also fell slightly by 0.01-0.02 yuan compared to the morning. Observing the later situation, it was feared that it would still create a trapped situation. As a result, this month fell by 0.035 yuan, December fell by 0.015 yuan, January fell by 0.0075 yuan, February fell by 0.0025 yuan, March fell by 0.005 yuan, and April improved by 0.0025 yuan.</p>
<h3>The Price of Wheat Futures Remains Hesitant 丨The Price of High-Quality Local Wheat Rises Step by Step丨</h3>
<p>The markets for each month of wheat futures generally showed a hesitant situation. Although the quotation for foreign wheat continued to be small by 0.02-0.06 yuan, this month had already passed, and although the price of foreign wheat was small for the far term, there was no significant impact, but the overall sentiment still needed to be considered. Due to the addition of taxes on foreign wheat, the number transmitted was consistent with the current market prices, but there was little movement. Because the price had already increased beforehand, it seemed as if nothing had happened at the moment. In the midst of the ups and downs in the morning and afternoon, there was a slight turn to a soft tone. Only December was smaller by 0.01 yuan, and there were no ups and downs for the rest. Very little current wheat was seen traded in the market, but the price of high-quality wheat rose step by step. For example, Nansu wheat had opened to 4.3 yuan, and Wuhe wheat was 4.25 yuan, a total of 700 bales, handled by Xinda Huafeng.</p>
<h3>Northern Traders Heavily Handle Southern Rice 丨Arrivals Too Strong, Grain Prices Still Fall丨</h3>
<p>(South of Shanghai) Yesterday, there were 7-80 rice boats arriving at each group, (nearly 10,000 shi) among which late rice was not seen to be scarce (5-6000 shi). Initially, the market atmosphere was very lax, but after the sellers dropped prices, the traders finally started buying. It was also heard that the shipping costs of the Beiyang group would rise, so they competed to rush the goods out. The market situation revived. It was estimated that the Tianjin, Qingdao, Yantai and other groups successively bought over 5,000 bales. However, because the acceptance of the market was harsh, it was still difficult to recover, and the price gradually fell by 0.10 yuan. The shops in this street were busier than before, but because the sources were still surging, the market situation was still soft. The market prices of Chang Group, Sutong Group, Nangang and other japonica rice and Duyang Tip rice all fell by some cents, and the negative variation was yuan. The wine merchant was stagnant and continued to be tired.</p>
<p>(North of Shanghai) There were 53-54 boats arriving from various routes in Hexia. The various outlets in the market were still good. The market price of new japonica rice was flat and tired in the morning market and turned stable in the evening market. The price of Yangdu, Budao japonica rice was flat and stable. The early thin rice was slightly tight by a few cents, the negative yuan price was 0.02 yuan small, and the white yuan was slightly reduced by a few cents.</p>
<h3>Trial Run of Selling Stale Guangdong Rice Amidst Passenger Stoppage; Fujian Merchants Still Hesitant</h3>
<p>Yesterday's passenger rice market saw an increase in stockpiles due to the suspension of passenger transport for several days. Fujian merchants still see a large potential trend, and sentiment is unanimously leaning towards a slight decrease. Although Fujian merchants have active appetites, they have been unable to operate smoothly due to the influence of the local situation and economic changes. As a result, the market is gradually trending downward. Although production costs are high, the market is trending soft to clear inventory. Yesterday, Fujian merchants and local businesses were mainly conservative, but Guangdong merchants took advantage of this weakness to try out some transactions in the market. Therefore, a portion of the market sentiment is slightly optimistic. A total of 180 bags of Hunan Jigong red rice were traded at a price of 7 yuan and 5 fen, and 200 bags of Nanjing Jigong rice were traded at a price of 6 yuan and 2 jiao and 8 fen. These prices were about 3 jiao lower than the selling prices of last week. However, market sentiment has stabilized somewhat. If Guangdong merchants continue to actively trade and Fujian merchants resume shipping to Tianjin, the market may easily turn around.</p>
<h3>Slight Rebound in Soybean Market Prices</h3>
<p>Yesterday, soybean sales were slightly higher. Exports are still being observed. Factories purchased 800 bags of Dangshan beans at a price of 3 yuan and 6 jiao. Inland areas purchased more than 200 bags of Henan Guide beans at a price of 3 yuan, 6 jiao, and 3 fen. Local businesses traded two carts of Zhengyangguan beans at a price of 3 yuan, 7 jiao, and 5 fen to 3 yuan and 7 jiao. Also traded were two carts of Bengbu beans at a price of 3 yuan, 5 jiao, and 5 fen to 3 yuan and 5 jiao. The market situation was down by 4 to 5 fen compared to the previous day.</p>
<h3>Dried Longan Prices in Southern and Northern Goods Shops Ease</h3>
<p>Freshly sun-dried longan from Xiamen is scarce in both arrival and inventory, but sales are also very limited, and market prices are sluggish, showing a slight decline. Yesterday, it was heard that the price has already dropped by one or two yuan compared to before. There is no continued pricing for old stock, but the shop has some inventory and the market may need to ease. Freshly sun-dried longan from the docks has even fewer sales due to high prices. It is said that local prices have fallen quite a bit, so there is no continued pricing.</p>
<h3>Five Fortunes White Crystal Sugar Drops by One Jiao</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market saw a slight decrease in customs gold, and trading was rare. The trend is weak. The guild priced No. 24 coarse granulated white ordinary goods down by 5 fen to 20 yuan and 1 jiao. British goods were priced at 20 yuan, 1 jiao, and 2 fen. No. 20 medium granulated white was traded, around 19 yuan and 8 jiao. No. 8 or 9 Dutch red ordinary was 15 yuan, 6 jiao, and 5 fen, and high-quality goods were 15 yuan and 9 jiao. Taikoo Sugar B Mark was 20 yuan and 4 jiao, and CW Mark was 2 jiao and 5 fen. Zhenji No. 1 cotton white was still 19 yuan, and the rest remained the same. Chaozhou shops continued to offer prices ranging from 15 yuan to 14 yuan and 7 jiao. Jianbang Dalaihua offered 200 boxes of standard Five Fortunes white crystal sugar at a price of 18 yuan and 2 jiao per box, which was 1 jiao lower than the previous price.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Warehouses Hold Over 22,000 Piculs of Dry Cocoons, Enough for Over 2,000 Bales of Filature Silk</h3>
<p>The Shanghai foreign firm silk market, facing a thousand-foot drop in overseas silk prices, has seen silk factories with piled-up inventories, unable to sell. Most of the silk in stock is mortgaged to the financial sector, and the amount of unreeled dry cocoons in warehouses is substantial, totaling 21,444 piculs, calculated at 500 catties each. This is enough to produce over 2,000 bales of white filature silk.</p>
<h3>Silk Market Transactions All Quiet Down, Whether Artificial or Natural</h3>
<p>The market for artificial silk cotton and wool fabrics is seeing no improvement in artificial silk sales. Yesterday, only local Hong Kong factories imported 15 cases of Feima, Meinu, Liuhai, and other brands of spot goods, priced from 178 yuan, 2 jiao, and 5 fen to 161 yuan, 7 jiao, and 5 fen.</p>
<p>In the foreign firm silk overseas raw silk market, there is high inventory and slow sales. The decline in Japanese silk is still sharp. The Shanghai foreign firm silk market is increasingly depressed. European and American firms, seeing a difference of 14 to 15 yuan between overseas silk prices and the cost of Chinese silk merchants, have not sent any silk orders. The market atmosphere is extremely stagnant. Yesterday, only Indian firms imported coarse yellow and white silk at increasingly weak prices after twelve days.</p>
<h3>Tung Oil Market: New Zhejiang West Tung Oil Opens, Only About a Hundred Transactions</h3>
<p>As the new tung oil season approaches, the market situation changes daily. Recently, the sudden rise of military unrest in Zhejiang, especially in areas around Jinhua and Lanxi, has significantly impacted business. The production volume of Lanxi tung oil was originally increasing. When Lanxi firms initially set the purchase price at 16 yuan per picul, it was soon increased to 17 yuan. However, since the Fujian Incident occurred, Zhejiang's defense has tightened, and credit, the lifeblood of commerce, has been restricted, affecting all goods. According to recent Lanxi news, the tung oil market has also been hit, with prices steadily declining, possibly returning to the original price of 16 yuan. Zhejiang West, including Jiaxing and other places, saw the highest price increase last week. It is said that over the past two days, merchants from inland carts have arrived in Shanghai and sold about a hundred pieces, with prices at 21 yuan per dan, about 1 yuan lower than at its peak. However, due to high interest rates, costs are above 21 yuan. Although the decline is due to the current situation, sellers are unwilling to lower prices. Therefore, there is no expectation of further declines in the future. However, Hanjiang tung oil remains weak. Merchants in Shanghai can purchase from both the north and south, so the decision to buy Zhejiang tung oil depends on whether it is cost-effective. If not, it is possible to abandon the south and go for the north. Therefore, each transaction is not for a large amount, also restricted by the Hankou market.</p>
<h3>Hardware Market: Highly Sought-After Items in the Hardware Market</h3>
<p>Spot goods of No. 26 galvanized iron sheets are currently out of stock. The price has risen sharply to 16 yuan per dan. If you want to purchase 10 to 20 dan, you still have to wait two to three months.</p>
<p>The market price of chess steel yesterday was as high as 287 yuan per dan, 2 yuan better than before. An investigation shows that spot goods are still scarce, with hopes of monopolizing the market.</p>
<p>For coarse lead wires No. 8, No. 10, No. 12, etc., the military made purchases yesterday. It is said that the transaction volume reached 600 to 700 dan. (It is said that this goods are used for military telephones), so spot goods are quite scarce.</p>

<p>Conversations</p>
<h3>Observing Various Things</h3>
<p>— Lizhai</p>
<p>Inventing brand new terms and jargon is clearly one of the specialties of our Eastern neighbor, the "friendly nation." When panic strikes, the "friendly nation" calls it "economic recession." When Hoover deferred debt payments, they called it "Hoover recovery." When Uchida came to power, we had the opportunity to learn about "scorched earth diplomacy." When Hirota took office, we were again learning about "rational diplomacy." In addition, the most clamorous in recent "dwarfed writing" newspapers is "quiet observation" of various things. Adopting "quiet observationism" towards the "anti-foreign movement in China," they now want to "quietly observe" the future development of the resumption of diplomatic relations between the US and Russia.</p>
<p>Regarding "quiet observation" of various things, it is not only not lacking among "domestic products," but also among "domestic people," there is no shortage of those who have "reached the pinnacle." Therefore, if one envies and sighs at the "quiet observation" of the "friendly nation," then one is either unfamiliar with "national studies" or a "fool" of the "big melon" world!</p>
<p>In Chinese stories and idioms, such as "Bian Zhuang stabbing the tiger" and "the snipe and clam fighting, the fisherman benefits," all have "quiet observationism" as their core. And like "think thrice before acting," it also has a very strong "meaning of quiet observation." Those who "think thrice" must ensure that there is no danger "before," no hidden trouble "after," and that the "present" has benefits that can be obtained without owing anything. Without "quietly" "observing," how can this painstaking effort be achieved?</p>
<p>As for "straddling two boats" and "watching the wind to steer the rudder," they are even more timeless "classics" of "quiet observationism," and "domestic" "politicians" or "traders," especially those who can be called "consummate skills" in this way!</p>
<p>"Quiet observationism" is always advantageous for individuals. Some "revolutionary leaders" or "philanthropists" who have made great fortunes are well-deserved, all obtained from "quiet observation." However, this kind of "benefiting the world before benefiting oneself" "quiet observation" is often more ominous than auspicious for the national nation. Therefore, there were too many "quiet observation" gentlemen in the two Jin dynasties, resulting in the invitation of Wang Hu's alien races to create more than a hundred years of dark history for China. The "quiet observation" gentlemen of the Southern Song Dynasty had not yet reached a conclusion, and the Jin soldiers had already crossed the river. And now, the quantity and quality of "quiet observationists" in China is an unprecedented spectacle, so where will our national nation go? This does not require looking at anything else, just looking at the foreign flags fluttering at the mouths of the Great Wall and some of the first- and second-class dignitaries busily purchasing villas and property in the "British" or "French" concessions in Shanghai, one can vaguely imagine its future.</p>
<h3>Under the Wheels</h3>
<p>— Yüsheng</p>
<p>Winter days are especially short, and it's dark before six o'clock. This evening, it's drizzling again, so this quiet road seems especially desolate!</p>
<p>"Woo! Woo!" A yarn factory beside the road is sounding the return echo. The two interrupted sounds indicate the 9:45 signal that the shift is about to change.</p>
<p>In less than a quarter of an hour, this dead road came back to life, especially at the entrance of the yarn factory. Peddlers carrying baskets and shouting; the idle "road heroes" lingering around; the family members of workers waiting for work to end with their oil shoes and umbrellas: and the endless stream of male and female workers going to the night shift, almost blocking this short stretch of road.</p>
<p>The clock on the yarn factory building moved forward minute by minute, and the active and noisy crowd became even more chaotic with the passage of time.</p>
<p>"Woo!" A car came speeding from afar.</p>
<p>"Bang!" When it broke into the center of the crowd, there was a sudden loud noise, and every face immediately showed tension, and they were using their ears and eyes to find out what had happened.</p>
<p>"Mom... Save... Me!" An unusual, tragic, and mournful sound wave broke the momentary silence.</p>
<p>"A car has run someone over!" Someone was shouting loudly.</p>
<p>The crowd immediately boiled over and flocked together like dark clouds covering the sky, quickly surrounding the car.</p>
<p>The engine had not yet stopped, and the driver wanted to step on the gas and escape.</p>
<p>"Bang!" The front window of the car had already been broken by a large worker.</p>
<p>"Damn it! Stop, do you still want to run?" Several people shouted in unison.</p>
<p>"Hit!" "Hit!" The crowd shouted wildly.</p>
<p>"Bang!" "Bang!" "Bang!" Three more windows on the car were broken in succession.</p>
<p>"Agen! Stop the car!" The gentleman sitting in the back of the car commanded his driver.</p>
<p>"Ah! Save... Me!" The already hoarse voice came from under the car.</p>
<p>"Someone is dying, quickly drag them out to see!" The eldest son, who was standing at the front, reminded everyone with a smart word, and three or four good men immediately emerged from the crowd, rolling up their sleeves and beginning to drag.</p>
<p>"Ouch!..." An extremely painful cry.</p>
<p>"The wheel has crushed the left arm, the car should be moved backward."</p>
<p>The driver slowly backed the car about five inches.</p>
<p>"Good!" Amidst everyone's approval, a young girl of seventeen or eighteen was dragged out of the wheel seam. The dirt on the road and fresh red blood covered his clothes, hair, and face. He was breathing rapidly with weak groans, still bleeding at the corners of his mouth, and his left arm was hanging limp behind his back.</p>
<p>"Damn it! You pigs in the car! Why don't you get out!" A sharp scream from the crowd.</p>
<p>The car door opened, and a short and fat gentleman came out of the car, wearing a very elegant Western suit, covered with a full-wool tweed coat, with a pair of cunning faces wearing glasses. He looked very embarrassed, but deliberately pretended to be very calm.</p>
<p>"Are you alright! It didn't crush you, did it!" The gentleman's tone was somewhat contrived, and the sound waves trembled slightly.</p>
<p>"Damn it! People are dying! And you say it didn't crush you!" The big man cursed angrily.</p>
<p>"Slap!" The gentleman's right face had already been slapped, half of it as red as pig's blood.</p>
<p>"Let's be civilized! Anyway, I'll take responsibility!" The gentleman surrendered.</p>
<p>"Ping!" He was hit twice in the waist again, this was done by a short man, his fists still clenched and unwilling to relax, as if he still needed to "continue to work hard".</p>
<p>"Everyone, don't fight! It's important to save people first!" The intelligent eldest son was most concerned about the person who had been crushed, and a word reminded everyone, so everyone's eyes shifted back to the unfortunate girl, releasing the gentleman from the siege.</p>
<p>"Yes! Send them to the hospital immediately, take my car, Agen! Come down and help him into the car." The gentleman, who was best at watching the wind, had received a pardon, but he still maintained the dignity of the owner when giving orders to the driver.</p>
<p>The driver, Agen, who was hiding in the corner of the front compartment of the car, was awakened from his nightmare by his master. He held the little girl's waist in both hands and pushed her forward.</p>
<p>"No! Where's my lunch box?" The poor little girl, when he was about to die, still remembered his life – the lunch box!</p>
<p>"Oh! Really, let's help him find it!" The eldest son was giving orders. After a few minutes of confusion, a lead lunch box was found in a small ditch two or three zhang away from the car. The originally rectangular box had turned hexagonal. The rice was spilled, and it was quickly passed from outside the crowd to the little girl's front in a "pass" manner. He was helped into the back seat by the driver and three or four workers. The snow-white cushion was covered with mud and blood.</p>

<p>Mr. Ba Shuhai, named Chengzhi, from She County, Anhui Province</p>
<p>"Woo!" The crowd split apart like a volcanic eruption, and the car carefully passed through the crack, like a criminal about to be executed escaping from the execution ground, speeding forward, and finally disappeared under the splashing mud and dim lights.</p>
<h3>Controlled Economy and Planned Economy</h3>
<p>— Su</p>
<p>The term "controlled economy" has been frequently heard in the mouths of Chinese intellectuals recently. They all feel that in today's bankrupt rural economy, the rural area cannot be revived without implementing a controlled economy. Therefore, the central government has established an economic committee, which is related to various control committees, so that all production can have a proper supply under various controls.</p>
<p>The so-called planned economy appeared at the same time as the controlled economy. Some people say that this is the controlled economy, while others say that this is a part of the controlled economy. Both are wrong. The following explains them separately:</p>
<p>Both controlled economy and planned economy are types of economic policies, but their contents are very different. A controlled economy does not have a specific plan, and only corrects the economic condition when it becomes morbid, such as increasing production when there is insufficient production, and decreasing production when there is too much. However, a planned economy has a specific plan, and all economic activities are carried out according to a certain plan. It focuses on production, engaging in a large amount of production.</p>
<p>Furthermore, countries that implement a controlled economy recognize the existence of private property, but only impose appropriate restrictions. However, countries that implement a planned economy never allow private property, because private property hinders the implementation of a planned economy.</p>
<p>From the above, it can be known that a controlled economy pays attention to consumption, while a planned economy pays attention to production. The former takes care of the present, while the latter plans for the future. Although the forms of the two seem different, the ultimate goal is to maintain a balance between production and consumption, so that there is no excessive surplus or shortage.</p>
<h3>Amateur Mailbox: Divorce is Never a Matter Worth Promoting</h3>
<p>Editor</p>
<p>My good friend, a year ago, married a man she had never met before by the order of her parents and the words of a matchmaker. Before marriage, she worked at a certain bank, and always harbored the ambition of independence; but she was unfortunately born in an old-fashioned and corrupt family, which thought that when a woman grows up, she should marry. When she was only eighteen years old, she had no choice but to enter a complicated family under the authority of her parents. Not long after the marriage, her mother-in-law died; although there were no elders above her, she had many sisters and brothers. Their feelings also deteriorated day by day due to different opinions. Although they have only been married for a year, both parties have decided to separate, and the other party is willing to pay her alimony. However, her mother's family is an old family, and they are not old enough to be independent. I request</p>
<p>Editor to reply to Shi Peizhen.</p>
<p>Editor's note: Divorce is never a matter worth promoting. A married couple who separates in the middle of their lives, not to mention the suffering of those who have children, even those who do not have children suffer deep and intense mental trauma. For the sake of enabling them to enjoy comparative happiness, we cannot but allow consensual divorce for couples who are unhappy. However, this kind of event is like a person developing a malignant sore, and it is imperative to apply a knife; but for the patient's vitality, it is harmful after all. We should be social pathologists, exploring the causes of these unhappy couples, and shouting loudly to warn society, so that this unfortunate event can disappear into nothingness.</p>
<p>Miss Shi's friend's relationship with her husband has already broken down, like a malignant sore that has already formed. Direct separation is the right thing to do. As for the stubbornness of her parents, it is not a problem. According to the stubborn argument, the first marriage of a woman should be decided by her parents, and the second marriage can be decided by herself; at most, she will not get help from her parents in the future. As for the fact that she is not yet an adult, the law stipulates that married men and women, regardless of whether they are adults or not, are deemed to have the ability to act, so there is no need to worry. However, those who are too young are prone to being deceived; if this mistake is a big one, they can still blame their parents, but if there are any mistakes in the future, they are no one to blame. If they do not divorce, it will be difficult to live day by day, and if they do, the future is bleak in the vast sea of ​​people. Therefore, they have to rely on their best friends to help them at any time.</p>
<p>In our opinion, the reason why the relationship between the couple has broken down so badly is complex, but the most important point is probably the "extended family system." It is inevitable that a woman who is usually highly valued will have horizontal opinions when she is in the midst of many uncles, aunts, cousins, and aunts. We propose that the lady and others may as well try to form a small family separately. Once the root of the opinion is cut off, the qin and se may be readjusted. If it does not work, it is not too late to divorce. I wonder how likely this suggestion is to be realized?</p>

<h3>Shanghai (6)</h3>
<p>— Zhang Laosan</p>
<p>(11) City Girls</p>
<p>Across from me was a group of typical Shanghai girls. Listening to their nonsensical chatter, it was as if they were also going to the preaching conference. It probably felt like attending a national goods exhibition, wearing a few homespun cheongsams, and basking in the compliments of socialites and "queens." Maybe they were even going to dabble in vegetarianism and scripture chanting.</p>
<p>They were all dressed alike, in a kind of gray silk fabric. Their thin lined jackets were nowhere near as thick as our old cloth robes, with short sleeves and stiff collars. A friend of mine once said bluntly, "Shanghai girls, as long as it's fashionable, they'll do anything. If some big shot sponsored a modeling contest, they'd strip off their pants and rush to join."</p>
<p>Little Huang said these words after a heartbreak. His friends laughed at him for being too cowardly, but I sympathized with him, thinking there was some truth in his words. Because of this thought, I glanced at them a few more times. They seemed to notice me too. They began to whisper among themselves. I was aware that my old cloth cotton robe was out of place in this carriage. Even if I couldn't afford a stiff Western suit, I should at least have a long robe with a stiff collar and a narrow waist. However, it was also partly my fault for daring to glance at them too much. Stealing a glance out the window, I saw that Xujiahui was approaching, so I ignored their snickers, reopened my newspaper, and avoided their gaze.</p>
<p>Today, Xujiahui was like the incense fair at Jing'an Temple, with cars arriving one after another. Stepping off the tram, even more surprisingly, a swarm of rickshaws surrounded me. I pushed my way out of the crowd and headed towards the "extraterritorial villa." That group of city girls suddenly saved a few coppers on rickshaw fare, using their beautiful but unhealthy legs, accustomed to riding in cars. They followed behind me, chattering and giggling, clearly making this country bumpkin the center of their conversation. You probably think I'm respectfully attending the preaching conference of the great philanthropist Xu Bingnan. I know I'm an unfashionable person, but even for Shanghai's so-called "modern" preaching conferences, I shouldn't belong there. You're judging a country bumpkin by your modern minds, which is too much of an insult to me. I turned around and glared at them angrily. They burst out laughing even louder. City girls! Go play with the young masters who follow under your fashionable cheongsams every day. Making fun of a country bumpkin like me, your victory isn't worth a laugh!</p>
<p>(12) Pingdi, it's you!</p>
<p>The first guests to enter the extraterritorial villa with their heads held high all had a special badge as a talisman. I was mixed in with the crowd when the doorman stopped me. He looked me up and down with disdain, his triangular eyes scanning my clothing.</p>
<p>"What do you want?" The proprietary tone of a superior to a subordinate.</p>
<p>"Can I see Mr. Xu Bingnan?"</p>
<p>I knew that even the King of Hell was easier to see than his underlings, so I asked politely.</p>
<p>"He's not receiving guests today!"</p>
<p>I wanted to explain that Xu Bingnan was my uncle, but looking at my old cloth cotton robe, no one would believe that the great philanthropist Xu Bingnan had such a low-class nephew. So I handed over my business card and said humbly,</p>
<p>"Please trouble you to present my card."</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, the laughter I had heard before came from behind again. That group of girls was standing behind me, and the leader clapped her hands, jumped forward, and shouted,</p>
<p>"Pingdi, it's you!"</p>
<p>I was stunned for a moment. The doorman was already standing like a wooden figure in a shop window, trembling and saying, "Miss, you're back." Only then did I realize it was my cousin Xu Huiqin, who cried all day because I accidentally broke her goldfish bowl. She turned back to the group of girls and said,</p>
<p>"I didn't recognize him wrongly!" She laughed again like she'd won a gamble. "You wait in the front hall, I'll take Pingdi to see Papa."</p>
<p>"Miss, the master is in the second concubine's room."</p>
<p>The doorman looked at me pitifully. He didn't expect a country bumpkin in a cotton robe to be the young lady's brother. He eagerly said that the master was in the second concubine's room, partly to please the young lady and partly hoping that I wouldn't say anything about his slow treatment in front of the master. We unfashionable young people can find examples everywhere of bumping into the nails of the "second masters." Seeing their attitude of looking down on us, I hated myself for studying so many years, not even having the prestige of a "second master." But seeing their groveling faces, I felt sorry for their circumstances. I gave him a kind look. My cousin didn't understand his meaning and glared at him angrily, "I know!"</p>
<p>Later, I learned that my cousin was dissatisfied with each of the concubines.</p>

<p>Film Special</p>
<h3>Interview with Chinese Film Artists (23) Continued from November 14th</h3>
<p>— Sha Ji</p>
<p>(10) Cai Chusheng, Director of "Morning of the Metropolis" (Part 1)</p>
<p>This is another very promising young filmmaker. He's only twenty-seven this year. In foreign literature, people of his age are often called "endearingly strange children." But in "Morning of the Metropolis," he already has remarkable achievements.</p>
<p>I don't think this is just temporary praise. Everyone must admit that he has artistic genius in his works. And I'm not just a "corner-boosting" Zhou Lang. Why would I want to praise someone? In ancient times, many young people had overly high expectations for generals, waiting anxiously for them to come to power and govern the country, so they enthusiastically supported them. Who knew that after the generals came to power, they would transform into fierce, blue-faced demons, launching a great slaughter. Those who had previously supported them were chopped into mincemeat under the butcher's knife. Thinking back on those events, I still feel frightened. How dare I support anyone?</p>
<p>Enough digression. I was walking along the gloomy Yanping Road one evening and approached the Lianhua Second Factory's studio. In the corridor on the second floor, I saw Yuan Congmei, famous for playing villainous roles, wearing a rather beautiful evening dress, her face like jade and her lips like vermilion. Shang Guanwu was also tidying up the newly glued-on mustache in front of the mirror. Understanding dawned on me. I knew they were getting dressed up to appear on the screen again.</p>
<p>Soon, Mr. Cai came up from downstairs. I said "Hello," and he also said "Hello," so we went into the director's office together. There, I saw Tan Ying, whom I had learned from twice in "Such a Hero" and "The Street Cleaner," writing a letter, rustling the paper. However, I didn't dare to bother her too much. In all conscience, I simply asked:</p>
<p>"Ms. Tan Ying, what plays have you been in recently?"</p>
<p>"Wind," he said. "Directed by Mr. Wu Cun..." I couldn't hear the rest clearly. I had to just nod along. In fact, it was already quite presumptuous to be so forward with a female star. As for the gentlemen who consider female stars "lovers of the masses," that's a different story altogether.</p>
<p>Soon, Director Cai took out a pack of chewing gum from his coat pocket. I chewed a piece, soft and sweet. I heard him say:</p>
<p>"Alright, now that we have tea, cigarettes, and candy, we can start talking."</p>
<p>"I think you should just talk freely," I said.</p>
<p>"But what should I say?" he said. "In these turbulent years, it's really not easy to speak. I've wanted to write something for your newspaper several times, but due to various reasons, I had to keep my mouth shut like a golden man. That's one aspect. On the other hand, when movies were still in the hands of the 'Mandarin Ducks and Butterflies School,' I dared to write a little something. But now that many progressive writers are paying attention to movies, I don't dare to write anything. I haven't read enough, I'm shallow, and I don't understand theory. If I were to write something, wouldn't it be like showing off in front of a master carpenter? So I think it's better for readers to get to know me through my works."</p>
<p>Dear readers, you see how modest he is. Unable to resist my urging, he finally spoke at length.</p>
<p>"Chinese cinema has finally had a history of one or two decades, but does it fulfill its proper mission now? That's still a big question. On the one hand, it's certainly due to economic constraints, but that dangerous severity has slowly disappeared. So what's most needed now is sound talent.</p>
<p>"Speaking of film talent, that's really not easy to cultivate. For example, to be a director, you need knowledge in all aspects. Cinema is a comprehensive art, encompassing literature, drama, painting, sculpture, architecture, music, and even human relationships and understanding of society. You need deep cultivation and understanding. But if you examine the Chinese film talent, you can say that since its history, there has never been a complete one. At the same time, the motivations for people to engage in film are also very complex. Some come with bad intentions. Because of this, for Chinese cinema to embark on a sound path, it is at least not possible at present. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Film Review "Rose Villa"</h3>
<p>— Ping Moer</p>
<p>"At The Villa Rose"</p>
<p>The social basis of detective films is the same as that of martial arts films. We don't need to say much. We only need to ask who the so-called "detective" serves to know!</p>
<p>Because of the widespread sales of the popular novel "Sherlock Holmes," the whole world knows about the detective skills of England. Therefore, we naturally have some hope for the British detective film "Rose Villa" in terms of plot.</p>
<p>But this hope was finally shattered. The strength of detective films naturally lies in "red herrings," in other words, the bizarreness of the plot. However, no matter how many "red herrings" and how bizarre, the audience will always gradually understand the result. But this "Rose Villa" is not like that at all. The last section of the film simply narrates the second half of the film:</p>
<p>"...the ending is particularly unexpected. Who the murderer is remains a mystery until the very last moment." Naturally, using a method like "Rose Villa" can make the audience feel especially strange. But the audience's feeling must be that it's too strange, because there is not a single clue to be found in the middle.</p>
<p>It is most difficult for the director to handle detective films, because if the story is presented clearly, the audience feels it is ordinary; if the story is made too bizarre, the audience feels it is strange and unreasonable. Therefore, the director of a detective film should first have an extremely precise scientific mind, and secondly, should be rich in suggestive techniques. Because this can prevent the film from becoming overly idealized, and at the same time can prevent the film from becoming ordinary. The director of "Rose Villa" has not achieved these two points.</p>
<p>Originally, detective films must first be reasonable. Their ability to make people feel interested because of surprise is entirely because there is something covering up the truth of the facts. Therefore, a brilliant detective must first and foremost split open these coverings. Then, the maker of a detective film should undoubtedly gradually split open the irrelevant red herrings, and finally reveal the truth, and the audience will gradually become tense as they approach the center of the story step by step.</p>
<p>At the same time, the reason why detectives can solve cases is based on some clues. Therefore, the makers of detective films should have suggestive methods everywhere and express some clues. In this way, the protagonist can naturally solve the case and will not be unreasonable, and sensitive audiences will also speculate because of these clues. If things are unexpected but still reasonable, the audience will definitely be even more amazed. Therefore, the shortcomings of "Rose Villa" are things that should be paid attention to in general detective films!</p>

<h3>Cecil B. DeMille on How to Select New Talent</h3>
<p>— Huang Yingdai</p>
<p>How do we select new stars? This is indeed a question worth studying. The great director Cecil B. DeMille can select them with just one glance. He still uses this method. He uses a method of practical testing, having the actors try out, or shooting a reel of film, but in this film, he can decide whether to keep or discard them in just a moment.</p>
<p>His past discoveries have all been based on a glance. Before Swanson became his actor, he only saw her once on screen in a bathing comedy. He also saw a thin, dark woman leaning against the door in just a glance. "Her figure, the way she leaned against the door, I was deeply convinced that this woman had ample ability," Cecil B. DeMille said. "Before she had work, I found out her name and called her to see me." This is how Swanson's work on the screen began.</p>
<p>Bebe Daniels was another one, selected by Cecil B. DeMille in a glance. At that time, one day, she was shooting a two-reel comedy directed by Rockett. Cecil B. DeMille went to the studio and only watched eight feet of film. He promoted and helped her as soon as Bebe Daniels performed it. Bebe Daniels' subsequent success on the screen began at this time.</p>
<p>This is Cecil B. DeMille's opinion. He never likes actors to visit him. He said: "The impression of a personal visit cannot be used as a standard for selecting actors. They are completely different on and off the screen. In a film or a practical test, we can see what their personality is like and what their impression is like. I believe in the integrity of the camera as a standard for selection, and the result has never been deceived."</p>
<p>However, his conditions for selecting actors are an exception when it comes to Alice Terry. Years ago, she worked in Cecil B. DeMille's editing room. This editing room was very close to his office. Every time he went from his office to the editing room, he saw this young beauty working in a hurry. He never thought of putting her on the screen. Until one day, an actor walked away in the middle of filming. She only shot a small part. He had to find someone to replace her immediately, otherwise it would waste a lot of time. He sent someone to the editing room to transfer her to replace her. She performed very well in this short film. As a result, she never returned to the editing room permanently. Does it seem too imprudent for Cecil B. DeMille to choose actors in this way? But he has never been deceived.</p>
<h3>Seeking Chinese Translation of "The Cherry Orchard"</h3>
<p>Someone wants a copy of the Chinese translation of "The Cherry Orchard." This book was originally written by the Russian Chekhov and compiled into the Russian Drama Selection by the Commercial Press, seemingly as the ninth volume. The book is now out of print. If anyone is willing to sell or temporarily lend it, I am prepared to pay a considerable price as compensation. Please send letters through Ling Hejun of this publication.</p>
<h3>Film Novels for National Glory (4)</h3>
<p>— Xie Yuesheng</p>
<p>Boom… boom… boom… clap… clap… clap… This burst of fierce gunfire exploded the January 28th battle. Enemy soldiers poured into China like a tide. Our land, security, lives, property, wives, lovers, parents, and children were either occupied or massacred by them. A tragic battle cry awakened Tianxiong's love dream. He resolutely gathered patriotic comrades to prepare for national salvation work.</p>
<p>Fight for national glory! Fight for national survival! In the rumbling of gunfire, Tianxiong and Hongyu led the heroic youths toward the station. The clever Xuefang specially made a badge for "National Glory" and gave it to Tianxiong, wishing them to work hard to kill the enemy and win glory for the country.</p>
<p>Kill… kill… kill… Tianxiong commanded the soldiers and joined the front line to desperately kill the enemy. They fought in the trenches like this for more than half a month. The brave Tianxiong was injured for bravely killing the enemy.</p>
<p>Xuefang received the news of Tianxiong's injury and immediately rushed to the hospital to visit him. She carefully took care of him. In just a few days, Tianxiong's injury was completely healed. She developed love and respect out of admiration.</p>
<p>"We were so worried when we got the news of your injury," she said sincerely, supporting the slightly lame Tianxiong as he stumbled to a stone grain mill.</p>
<p>"Thank you, but it is right to die for the country," Tianxiong replied with a smile. They felt a kind of inner joy.</p>
<p>The citizens of the Republic of China should all be like Tianxiong. Su Rong was urging and encouraging himself. He felt that the seedlings of love between Xuefang and Tianxiong were harvested from Tianxiong's patriotic struggle. He heard Xuefang and Tianxiong's words introducing Hongyu to him, and felt ashamed as if he had been insulted. He decided to participate in the work of resisting the enemy.</p>
<p>The area of the war gradually expanded. The divine broadsword team bravely attacked the enemy. Su Rong commanded the soldiers, killing the enemy soldiers and begging for their lives. Our army continued to occupy the enemy's lines and finally achieved the final victory.</p>
<p>The ceasefire agreement put an end to the war. The news of Su Rong's death in battle spread to the rear, giving the people an encouraging spirit of patriotism and inspiring respect and admiration. This news made Hongyu and Xuefang feel sad and weep.</p>
<p>A round of residual sunset hung upside down in the corner of the western sky, and it had lost its inherent intensity. The evening bell of Dang… Dang… Dang was sent out from the ancient pagoda, containing a miserable and sad aftertaste.</p>
<p>In front of the brand-new Monument to the Loyal Souls of the Martyrs, stood a pair of young couples and a girl in plain clothes, mourning the loyal soul of this deceased martyr. From the silent tombstone, a voice vaguely came out… long-term resistance…recover lost land… (End)</p>
