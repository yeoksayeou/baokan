<p>孫軍屯墾青海事件之初期。吾人亦可認爲當局進行安内工作之一種活動。蓋當六月間張北風雲緊急時。孫殿英以五萬之衆。夾處懷來沙城一帶。倘使捲入漩渦察局形勢。自必更加嚴重。給以開拔之費。使西開青海屯墾。亦不失爲改善局勢之適宜處置。然其後孫軍旣實行西開。甘青方面。亦起而作相對之表示。另一方面之不安。逐漸形成。疏解而消弭之。實爲當局彼時必不可緩之工作。乃遷延三月。坐使差可稱安之地。增長其不安形勢。九月下旬十月初旬之間。孫部先遣隊設兵站於寗夏境。寗夏省政府在主席馬鴻逵領導下全體辭職。作和平之拒絕。甘青當局。亦取一致動作。此際幸而孫馬尚知顧全大局。各表示待决於中央耳。否則新疆紛爭之局勢。不難再見於此一方面。西北又多一不可解决之糾紛矣。此相持之局勢。最近似可暫維現狀。昨日本報北平電訊。稱軍分會已令孫軍暫駐五原臨河一帶待命。俟明春天暖後。再商入青辦法。而孫軍代表在北平之表示。亦謂限於天氣。事實上亦只好暫駐五原包頭。待春暖再候命西開。然此種現狀之維持。僅能使不安形勢。暫勿擴大。疏解消弭。則仍不容稍緩也。</p>
<p>青海地廣二百二十九萬四千餘華方里。大於江浙七倍左右。而人口不足百萬。較之浙江之二千餘萬。江蘇之三千四百餘萬。成二十。三十之比例。孫軍五萬人開入此地曠人稀之區域。可以開發地方。可鞏固邊陲理論上實至適當。然一觸及事實。則有經費之問題。有各方勢力衝突之問題。吾人讀朱紹良馬麟馬鴻逵等呈中央電。以糧食缺乏及主客之爭爲詞。請令孫部從緩西移。或予另調。癥結所在。顯然可見。當局其將如何利用此從冬待春之數月時間。就此癥結。消弭不安現象。而使孫軍得達赴青屯墾之志願乎。</p>
<p>自六月間孫軍赴青之令發表。至九月間寗夏邊境兩方相持。歷時三月餘。當局已因遷延而造成此一方面之不安形勢。自今日至來春三月。爲時更較久長。大有將不安形勢疏解消弭之餘裕。當局其勿一誤再誤使此問題成不了之局。吾人逆料當局對此顯然之癥結。並非不能明瞭。特苦於其他更重大事件之應付。精力有不及耳。然旣以安内爲揭　則毋使此差可稱安之地。更成重大之不安。實屬必要。當局苦心勞力以應付之新疆紛爭。其當前之敎訓也。</p>

<h3 id="c238">頭上的時裝 <a href="#c238" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e238" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">238</a></h3>
<p>— 有行</p>
<p>就像上海的建築物一樣，上海的時裝雖然比房屋翻造得快，却始終還没有得到一個「自有的」型式！上海人都忙極了，大家覺得營造廠家和時裝店舖有增無已亦就認爲滿意了。</p>
<p>自然，上海的地位關係，在生活上各方的需要是無法拒絕外來的影響，因而所謂「自有的」種種極容易消滅而難得新生的，但是那高領口高開叉的旗袍不是稱作上海時裝麽？現在就來談談這種時裝：</p>
<p>原來就没有戴帽子的習慣，又有一頭盪捲的美髮，小姐太太們是不怕日曬風吹的，上海時裝便少去了一半創造的工作！旗袍本身的變化逃不出領口，身長，袖長，開叉的加高减低，長些短些，再加一點鈕扣的編排滾邊的寬窄而已，上海時裝又省去不少的裁縫工作！於是衣料的好壞就直接影響着時裝的美醜；而衣料上的花樣選擇竟更重要於裁製！小姐太太們不都是親身到大公司或綢緞店去揀選最時行花色的衣料，回到家喊裁縫拿去做麽？</p>
<p>這樣談法並不是存心挑剔上海時裝而是願望上海仕女對此問題加以注意：要不要戴帽子？時行的剪裁法有無缺點？怎樣去修改？衣料的選擇應當用什麽標凖？談話的本意在試行舉出一些問題敬請上海仕女用揀選衣料花樣的功夫亦親身去創造或建設新的剪裁法，更望抽出空閑時間去研究「頭上的時裝」（蓄髮？梳髻？戴帽子？打結子？……）不必要採用歐美時裝的型式却不妨效法她們對時裝的努力研究，由此而得着，像市府新厦在建築方面，比較是「完美的」，「自有的」上海時裝。</p>
<h3 id="c239">時裝及其經濟之影響續 <a href="#c239" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e239" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">239</a></h3>
<p>— 許弢</p>
<p>奇特的志趣　狂亂的裝飾</p>
<p>時裝之平民化</p>
<p>在物質上，因裝飾品的過度用耗，幾乎把一切有益的鳥獸都毁滅了，因爲有幾類的皮毛，在那滅跡，於是想用人工方法來養鳥獸或以獵取規律來限止保護。例如近代歐美女子的鞋子，手提袋，皮夾等物，都愛用鰐魚的皮，聽說在南美洲這些動物幾乎完全絕跡了。</p>
<p>現代的工業經濟，對於出品日趨平民化；時裝當然逃不了這個圈子。從社會問題上看，確是很可注意的事。因爲由這樣的趨向，繼可造成偉大的消費量和成本的滅輕，使得大工業的存在。在工業上，由這樣需要的原因，不得不製造廉價的貨品。目前的時裝不但專爲華富的女子，同時要使社會上一切的女子都能穿得入時。要曉得，無論誰都願他的女人和子女，穿得美麗；或許還想更穿得好點呢！</p>
<p>還有帶着環境，地區，風俗色彩的服裝，與歷史其實有很大的價值；不過近年來，因了時裝的一致普遍，已漸漸的日趨消滅了。同時對於國境，或許也將完全打破，例如目前國内男女的服裝急烈的洋化；竟有非洋不衣不用之趨勢。</p>
<h3 id="c240">最近女裝變動消息　編者報告 <a href="#c240" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e240" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">240</a></h3>
<p>以前因爲旗袍衣义，開得很高的關係，所以除了夏季裸腿以外，其餘都穿很長很鮮艷綢料的大脚管褲子，褲脚管上還綴着很漂亮的花邊；但是最近因爲旗袍衣义，突然减短。只開八寸，所以那些長褲子又被打倒，而改穿短褲子了。</p>
<p>上期編者曾報告襯絨的旗袍，夾裘上下擺已不釘花邊；但是在這一個星期中，留心在交際塲中看到許多摩登女士的襯絨旗袍，夾裘的顔色，十人倒有九人是用的淡湖色小紡，而且與袍面是完全縫住，不像上半年的樣子了。（上半年的袍子夾裘是不和袍面縫牢的）</p>
<p>含有戰士色彩的銅鈕子花呢女大衣，去年本由電影女明星譚雪蓉女士所獨創，而大家仿製，遂流行一時；但是今年最摩登的女士，又把大衣略略改變了一些。鈕子改用比大衣料顔色較深的絲螺鈿的；大衣下擺比去年更寬大；腰帶也用比大衣料顔色較深的呢來做；領圈上也連綴着與腰帶同顔色同質料呢製的圍巾，可以向後圍着。</p>
<p>據皮貨商方面消息，去年流行大衆化的三角黑皮女大衣，恐怕今年已不流行；因爲今年已有許多摩登女士，買獾皮做大衣，（或者與獾皮相紡的皮）而另外用黑西耳的狐形圍巾，圍在頸項裏。</p>

<p>最近有人用深色純紆縐，製爲旗袍，兩袖口綴以荷葉邊色之糺縵縐，衣領衣襟及下擺均鑲玄色一扁滾，而下擺五寸半高處，綴一闊糺縵邊，衣又則仍開二尺高。旗袍外加穿美氅緞之短披肩，蓋覺堂皇富麗。</p>

<p>— 凌雲</p>
<p>老友李顯煌，是個大胖子，立夏那天，他府上闔第秤人，别人都是好好的秤着，有的七十斤，有的八十斤，一會兒也就完事了，獨自輪到他過磅的時候，秤鈕繩斷了兩回，始終没有秤成功，他夫人一時智生，揀了根粗鉛絲，絆住了麻繩，牢牢吊在秤上，纔勉强把這件事執行終了，可是秤錘一直向秤梢上推出去，直到一百四十三斤那幾點星的地方，　煌頭頂上的一根秤桿，才水平似的趟着。</p>
<p>他因爲身體肥胖的緣故，走起路來，十分累墜，要是從下面走到三層樓上，至少要休息兩分鐘，那一股喘着的氣，方始平復過來，他因爲覺得長衫馬褂，穿着不方便，而且肚子一大，長袍子章華毛羢紡織廠全景</p>
<p>的中部，便常常圓溜溜的隆起一團，好像夏天放在檯上的西瓜，上面覆了一塊毛巾，兩面下垂，中間高挺着，煞是不雅觀，所以顯煌，平時總穿西裝，一來經濟，二則便利，他逢着朋友，總是很高興的　别人穿西裝，不過在他的介紹詞中，附帶着有兩個條件，就是做褲子的時候，腰身必定要做得寛舒些，尤其是臂部前後不可做得太窄，若是被介紹的也是個胖同志，他就老實的勸他做兩條褲子。</p>
<p>我和顯煌差不多是三天兩頭遇見的，記得去年冬天，有一次吾見他上身穿的是藏青嗶嘰西裝，下面的褲子却是灰華達呢的，我便問他，什麽你又穿兩色裝了，他道，不要說起。「吾這一套嗶嘰衣裳，穿上不過三個月，褲擋裏又出毛病了」，說着，便翹起腿來，指示吾那破碎的地方，我道，這當然是太緊窄的關係罷，他說「我的褲子，十條倒有九條是這樣的毛病，」他說的時候，嘴裏不時的嘆氣，接着道，「穿西裝便利是便利的，可是這一關打不破，大塊頭未免是太不經濟，還希望洋鬼子加緊改良，爲胖人造福，」說完了，大家哈哈一笑！</p>
<h3 id="c243">時裝在蘇州張一鵬滑稽演說 <a href="#c243" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e243" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">243</a></h3>
<p>— 莉莉</p>
<p>近年來蘇州女子的服裝，漸漸地上海化，所以上海新流行的時裝，往往不到幾天，便流行到蘇州。但是蘇州自從北局的士邱，一個個剷平，而變成歌樓劇塲，以及自從護龍街觀前街闢爲馬路以後，一切的流行品，都緊萃於此，以前閶門的繁華，逐漸地衰落，所以閶門一帶的服裝，與觀前一帶的服裝，也逐漸地稍有分野，閶門還保存着原有的文采，而觀前却十分地發皇，成爲雛形的海化了。</p>
<p>最近上海美亞織綢廠，與蘇州的乾泰祥同仁和兩家綢緞局，假蘇州青年會的大禮堂，開了三天國産綢緞時裝表演大會，因爲在蘇州還是創舉，所以鬨動了全城。有些太太奶奶小姐們，在上午十一時，便帶了麵包乾點心，趕到會塲，情願坐候到下午兩點鐘才開幕的表演。青年會會塲内，本來只有四百餘座位，但是每塲均擠滿了七八百人，還有許多擠在場外，不能進塲的人很多很多。</p>
<p>張一鵬在開幕的一天，在臺上演說，最激昻慷慨，他把國貨綢緞，比諸於自巳的子女，自己的老婆，他說：「我們對於自己的子女，不管他是否生得俊秀，讀書是否用功，比别人的子女，總格外地十分疼愛，那是因爲是自己的子女；對於老婆，不問她長得是否美麗，是否能幹，處理家政，總也十分的愛她，因爲她是我自己的老婆，所以國産綢緞是中國人自己的原料，自己來織造，便應該愛穿，何况像美亞廠這麽好的綢緞，怎麽敎人不愛用呢？」張一鵬先生鬚髮巳白，而談吐風生，所以引得全場的拍手歡笑，</p>
<p>在會塲中，很有許多美麗的女郎，早已着到塲内陳列的各種綢緞，便立刻買了回去，製成新裝，而到會再來參觀的，大概純紓縐一種，男女穿得最多，糺縵縐也多，用美氅緞製成大衣的也不少。</p>
<p>起初有人懷疑所表現的時裝式樣，不過表示新奇，此外一無作用，嗣經有人在臺上，把每一件時裝詳細說明，縐的部份是爲了什麽，短蓬袖是何功效，鑲一荷葉邊是何理由，以及配色有關時令節序，没有一點没有講究，大家才明瞭時裝的確適合時季，年齡，身材，環境，完全是合理化的衣裝，並不是專門炫奇鬭勝。</p>
<p>在没有表現之前，也有人誤會了他到會參觀的目的，是看登臺表演的幾個女星，但是張一鵬也說明表現的人，不過是因爲提倡國貨的關係，而犧牲她的色相，做一面衣架，大家也十分明瞭了。</p>

<h3 id="c244">音量調節法 <a href="#c244" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e244" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">244</a></h3>
<p>— 李元慶</p>
<p>收音機的音量，當然求其愈大愈好，但是在下述的情形之下，却不能不施以相當的節制：</p>
<p>（一）欲得不失眞的聲音。</p>
<p>（二）在公共居處或人烟稠密的地方。</p>
<p>（三）深夜及清晨。</p>
<p>調節音量的方法，固然很多，但是能夠適合各種條件的，却是很少。本篇詳述各種調節的方法，並酌加簡單的批評。</p>
<p>增減燈絲電壓，調節音量的大小，這是最簡單而又最經濟的方法。（見第一圖Ａ）不過一方面增减燈絲電壓，一方面屏壓依舊保持常數，那麽，燈絲上發射出來的電子，不是太多，便是太少，結果，得到的聲浪就不免失眞。（此法在交流收音機内不適用，因交流眞空管燈絲熱度，增減極遲。）</p>
<p>天線電露中並聯一可變電阻，（如第一圖Ｂ），調節音量，確可避免失眞。不過在鄰近有强力播音台的地方，不用天地線也能收聽時，便不能適用。</p>
<p>栅路内添一可變電阻，也可調節音量。（如第一圖Ｃ，Ｄ）不過配諧部份内加入許多電阻後，在選擇性方面，便有很大的影響。</p>
<p>增减再生力的大小，有時也可調節音量。（如第一圖Ｅ）不過轉動的地位有限，使用時很不方便。過小則聲息全無，過多便容易發生振蕩，擾亂正音。</p>
<p>增減屏極電壓，調節音量，頗能令人滿意。（如第一圖Ｆ）ＢＰ爲傍路電容器，加入後可避免雜聲。</p>
<p>在簾栅極線路内串聯一可變電阻，要算是最普通而又最完美的方法了。現在市上出售的收音機，有許多都是採用這種方法。（如第一圖Ｇ）（未完）</p>
<h3 id="c245">怎樣用直流電壓表測交流電壓 <a href="#c245" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e245" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">245</a></h3>
<p>— 一知</p>
<p>我們知道直流電壓表祗能測直流電壓，倘欲測交流電壓，必需一交流電壓表，但現有一個簡法，可將直流電壓表用作交流電壓表。一表兩用，可少買一只交流電壓表。</p>
<p>直流電壓表能測交流電壓，係利用電極流電壓之接欲測交</p>
<p>整流的原理，其製法很是簡單，接線法如圖所示，用件除已有的直流僅需一個兩極或三極式的眞空管，此管的燈絲電源，或用乾電池，蓄電池及交流電供給之。用時電表上讀出的電壓數，應以巳核定的某電壓倍差率數（即交流電壓與直流電壓相差的倍數，此數依眞空管的屏流，屏阻及電表的耗阻而定，因所用的電表與眞空管不同，故其電壓倍差率數，第一次須先核定）乘之，其積數即爲交流電壓值。</p>
<p>作者有Ｗeston　Model　５０６，o_15　Volts直流電壓表一只，曾用２８o整流管照上圖連結之，以測交流電壓，其電壓倍差率爲２.７若用２０１管，則其電壓倍差率當爲３.３o例如，用２８o整流管司整流，以測某交流電路，電表上讀數爲８弗，則此交流電路的電壓爲８Ｘ２.７＝２１.６弗（約）</p>
<p>電壓的倍差率，與電表的靈敏度成反比，電表愈靈敏，則其倍差率愈小，而其正確度則愈大，故欲測交流電路内之正確電壓值，直流電表最好用靈敏之高耗阻的，此點有附帶聲明的必要，故述之。</p>
<h3 id="c246">發射機的高週率放大　（續） <a href="#c246" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e246" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">246</a></h3>
<p>— 明襄</p>
<p>Ｂ類放大無激勵時無屏流（當然亦無栅流），巳如上述，今將振盪級開啓，使與放大級成極疏交連，則輸入的激勵電壓極小，以曲線Ａ表之（圖見前期）此時放大級有極小屏流，但栅流仍爲零，因激勵電壓較小於原有的栅負位。曲線Ｂ表示激勵電壓的最高值，適等於栅位負電壓，此爲栅電流即將開始流行的一點：如交連史密，可使激勵電壓超過Ｃ電壓，而産生栅流（在曲線Ｃ隂影一部份時），栅流流入Ｃ電池，無異使Ｃ電池充電，栅流表的指數，即爲其充電率；如在Ｃ電池線路内，接一電阻，當栅流流過時，此電阻兩端，必産生電壓降，此電阻即著稱的栅漏Ｇ.L其作用可帮助供給栅負位，如僅以栅漏的電壓降供給栅負位，而不用Ｃ電不能得到眞實的Ｂ類放大，因激勵移去的，栅流停止，栅漏當然不能産生電壓降，以使屏流完全截止：最後的問題爲Ｂ類放大的栅Ｅ</p>
<p>負位，究須若干？可以公式栅負位－丨Ｐ</p>
<p>求之，Ｅb爲屏電壓，ц爲眞空管放大係數（可在眞空管特性表上查得之）；巳知栅負位，再求栅漏的電阻，可依歐　　　　　　Ｅ</p>
<p>姆定律：栅漏＝丨爲栅負位，Ｉ即栅　　　　　　Ｉ</p>
<p>流表所指示的電流。</p>
<p>放大級的調整及平差法，巳見本刊「短波發射機之調凖法及其步驟」一篇，故不另贅。（完）</p>

<p>— 微言</p>
<p>丨丨國内播音界之現狀丨丨</p>
<p>南京</p>
<p>但是在事實上南京還是有許多聽衆以收到滬杭各處的播音爲樂，這又是什麽緣故呢？因爲：（一）「喜新厭舊」是人類的常性。譬如南京扳鴨，固然肥美可口，但是多吃了也會覺得淡而無味。口與耳同屬五官，同樣，聽慣了一種聲音，也要生厭的。</p>
<p>（二）該台直隸中國國民黨，爲黨治下唯一的宣傳機關，立塲與地位，與普通商業化或是私人研究用的播音台，絕對不同。因此，對於節目的選擇與趨向，自有相當的範圍。</p>
<p>（三）南京係政治區而非商業區，娛樂場所，爲數不多，搜集娛樂節目，非常困難。</p>
<p>現在祗就可能範圍内，提出二點，謹向該台作蒭堯之獻：</p>
<p>（一）利用無綫電提倡體育，在國内確以該臺爲嚆矢。不過每晨播送國術或早操時，微嫌刻板與枯燥。作者今夏曾聽到上海一家外人設立的播音臺，播送早操時，並有輕微美妙的西樂。聽衆一方面聽到Ｕp,down,left,right等口號，一面又聽到幽揚悦耳的樂聲，確乎可以感覺到無上的愉快。該臺如能仿照此種辦法，當可格外增加聽衆的興趣了。</p>
<p>（二）許多人在飯後都需要一種相當的娛樂，以調劑他們日常機械般的生活，所以該臺每日十二時至一時的音樂節目，最爲聽衆所歡迎。同樣希望該臺每晚六時至六時三十分的音樂節目，也能酌量延長些時間。</p>
<p>聽說該臺爲實充節目起見，久有在京滬間敷設專線之議，因爲設備經費太大，一時不克實現。將來此項計畫，如果能成爲事實，那麽在節目方面，必有一番特殊的貢獻了。</p>
<h3 id="c248">常識 <a href="#c248" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e248" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">248</a></h3>

<p>（十七）眞空管概說（一）</p>
<p>（一）概說：眞空管之於無線電，宛如心臟之於人體，其地位之重要，人盡知之。無眞空管之發明，則無線電之發達無以至今日之極盛。今日眞空管之製造日新月異，初則由二極而三極，繼則由四極而五極，以至於最近所出之種種新式管，花樣翻新，五花八門，其類之多，大有使吾人應接不暇之勢。兹將其種類及内容一一略述於次。</p>
<p>（二）二極眞空管：如上圖所示，（a）爲二極眞空管之通用符號，（b）爲其斷面圖形。該管在高眞空玻璃管内裝有燈絲（Filament）與屏極（Ｐlate）兩極。燈絲又稱隂極（Cathode），如通電於燈絲，則燈絲因受熱而發射具有負性之電子（Electron）。屏極又稱陽極（Anode），其功用爲吸收電子。如屏極接有正電時，則能吸收由燈絲所發射之電子，同時即有電流（俗稱屏流）由屏極向燈絲流入。如屏極接有負電時，則不能吸收電子，因此電流亦無由流通。使用於交流收音機之整流管係利用此理而製成者。故二極眞空管可司整流作用，亦可作檢波之用，但以二極管作檢波遠不若以三極管作檢波之靈敏，故今日殆無有用二極管以檢波者。</p>
<p>（三）三極眞空管：上圖（c）爲三極眞空管之通用符號，（d）爲其斷面形。其所異於二極管者，乃在於前者多一栅極（Grid）。如圖所示，栅極位於燈絲與屏極之間，其功用爲限制屏流入燈絲，即由栅極之電壓變動，可使屏流增减也。且供給栅極之電壓雖少，電流雖微，但屏流之變化則相當增大，是即由於眞空管之有放大作用，可應用於高週率與成音週率之放大。此外三極管之功用其主要者爲，整流，檢波，振盪，調幅等。</p>

<p>咦！中國也會有飛機三千餘架，高射大砲一千餘門麽？大概我看錯了，把那十字看做了千字吧。但，抹了抹眼睛，明明是三千餘架，一千餘門，明明是飛機與高射大砲，報紙上旣没有誤植鉛字，我也不曾目迷五色。好了！好了！廣州市一隅之地，所有飛機和高射大砲，巳有這可驚的數字；全國的都會，姑作十個廣州市計算，便該有飛機三萬餘架，高射大砲一萬餘門，那麽，中國的空軍是世界第一，中國的防空力量也是世界第一，國際地位可以一躍萬丈，擦着鼻頭道一句文言，「不亦樂乎」？啊「不亦樂乎」？</p>
<p>可是，子細一看，看出毛病來了；原來，我看報忽略，漏去了幾個字。報紙上載：「各界紥作飛機三千餘架，紥作高射大砲千餘門。紙燈紗燈約千餘種，各燈皆寫有空防救國四字」。原來如此，又是紗糊紙紥的東西。</p>
<p>我曾在本欄說過，中國科學不落後，只有「巧玲瓏」紙紥舖中的漿糊博士出風頭；廣州市各界空防救國提燈大會，也無非是漿糊博士出風頭罷了。今歳蘇滬各地，都在隂雨之夜度中秋，廣州市的中秋之夜，旣是月白風清，却又舉行此如火如荼地三千架飛機千餘門高射砲的提燈大會，正應了一句蘇滬俗語，「月下提燈空掛明」。丨丨明與名諧音。</p>
<h3 id="c250">臺灣外紀 <a href="#c250" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e250" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">250</a></h3>
<p>— 烟橋</p>
<p>夏中王佩諍兄問我，見過一部像蟫史一般的文言章回體小說臺灣外紀没有？我說没有，並且查過幾種關於小說考證的書，也不見這書名，因此就許他是一部孤本小說。他的朋友化掉七十塊錢買了九本（缺一本）去，不算寃枉</p>
<p>最近偶然翻閱文明書局出版的筆記小說大觀，在第四輯裏，發見了臺灣外紀了。和佩諍兄所說的一般面目，是福建珠浦江日昇所作。據康熙甲申（四十二年）㞾源陳祈永的序說：「余司鐸南詔，的乙丑（康熙二十四年）春獲交江子東旭，蓋循循然重厚博物君子也。嗣出其所輯臺灣外紀三十卷。……專爲鄭氏而作。……是書以閩人說閩事，詳始末，廣搜輯，逈異稗官小說，信足備國史採擇焉。」那末這部書，已出世了二百二十多年，並且書中常有按語，證明他所說的確實可信，大概作者一方面想把這三十七年海外殖民的偉蹟，普及到民間；一方面還是要取信見容於士大夫，所以寫成了特殊的體裁。不過有一個疑竇，在他寫這部書的時候，康熙還没有死，不應該稱他聖祖，或者陳序是僞託。</p>
<p>從他的按語，知道日昇的父親美鰲，從永勝伯鄭彩隨侍弘光督師江上，後署龍驤將軍印，至丁己歸誠清朝。那麽他也是一個遺少，所以不敢眷念故主，只好寄戀於孤島英雄。但是文字之間，已經琢磨得的溜滾圓，處處是順民的表示了。</p>
<p>全書三十卷，每卷有七字回目，對仗並不工緻，如「施將軍議留臺灣，大清國四海太平」。可見他對於章回體小說的作法，不甚熟溜，所以連欲知後事如何須聽下回分解這一類的收煞都不用。</p>
<p>中國有幾個譯音字，有的從英文來的，如「赤般」說是般名，大約就是Ｓhip，如嗶吱，哆囉呢等，還有說及日本人怕沿海的唐人，甚至把大小船隻去舵，不許「不肖倭人出洋作反」。曾幾何時，那辛苦得來的臺灣，竟拱手送給「不肖倭人」。不但如此，還要添上一個「四海太平」的「大清國的老窠，我們看了這部書，怎的不憤懣欲絕呢？</p>
<p>我以爲這部書倒值得給他穿一套新裝，而加以翻印，比空喊着收回失地，夠味得多。</p>
<h3 id="c251">詩人與酒 <a href="#c251" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e251" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">251</a></h3>
<p>— 詠文</p>
<p>因了「酒可陶吾性，詩可述吾懷」的緣故，所以自古來詩人除了不識「詩酒韻事」的王安石以外，大都是終日沉湎於麫藥之中，過其「一春長費買花錢，每日花邊一醉眠」「醉時睡足醒時飮；不狂圖甚」？的「詩酒疏狂」生涯。</p>
<p>詩人祗要一見有酒，便露出「道逢麴車口流涎」的釀樣兒，巴不得「今朝有酒今朝醉，且盡樽前有限盃」，雖幸辱皇帝伯伯的寵召，也自顧自吟其「天子呼來不上船，自稱臣是酒中仙」自然以「酒仙」的身份而違旨了。故詩人心目中但願「三百六十日，日日醉如泥」，就百事不管，還說：「醉裏乾坤大」「一月二十九日醉，勝於世人二十九日醒」呢！</p>
<p>詩人的「酒慾」，眞是演透。你看送别要飮酒：「樽酒慰離顔」；留别要飮酒：「欲行不行各盡觴」；談談天又要飮酒：「把酒話桑麻」；甚致作客戚友家之久否，也以有酒無酒爲目標：「但使主人能醉客，不知何處是他鄉」！其他登山玩水諸事，更是非要「會須一飲三百盃」「先拚一飮醉如泥」不可了。</p>
<p>詩人類多工愁善感，所以要發「此身飮罷無歸處」牢騷了。因此好飮「鵝黄」，也或是假以忘懷憂愁的一種表現！不然什說：「何以解憂？惟有壯康」？又什會作出「五花馬，千金裘，呼兒將出换美酒，與爾同銷萬古愁」「泛此忘憂物」「一醉解千愁」，和「杯裏分社都是淚」·如何送淚入愁腸」的詩來呢？</p>
<p>詩人中飮酒最有名的，誰都知要首推李白。不信請看酒肆中所懸「太白遺風」的横額，就可以知道太白飮酒的洪量了。但是身後願人題他的墓曰：「梁故酒徒陳君之神道」的陳宣，與作「酒德頌」的劉伶，序「飮酒詩」的陶潛諸酒徒，烟量也都是不弱呀！</p>
<p>短訊　程硯秋此次以應全運會之約赴京、京中邵元冲曹纕蘅，冒鶴亭諸名流，以散原老人亦適來京，特於舊歷重九作登高雅集，擇定在掃葉樓舉行。聞在都名流，被邀者達六十餘人，一時稱盛。聞散原老人擬贈詩禦霜，老人以疾廢詠事頗久，是尤足爲藝林佳話，程卽於次日首途來滬矣。</p>

<p>第十七回　孰能無情家思灰士氣　兵不厭詐豪語壯軍心</p>
<p>現在營長提到讓他回海甸去抓車，他心裏忽然一動，這豈不是回家去一個絕好的機會。縱然營裏有什麽事躭誤了，自己因公出去的，也就可以推諉了。如此想着，就向寳營長道，這樣說，我就到海甸去找一趟試試瞧罷。反正四隻腿的牲口找不着，兩條腿的人，還有什麽找不着嗎？寳芳笑道，你也一功而兩得，回去瞧瞧你那未婚夫人，不比自個兒抽功夫回去好的多嗎？其實你也别那樣儍自己找去。你帶幾名弟兄，再呌司務長跟着，你讓他們出去找，你在家裏和老爺子談上幾句，然後找着你們那位夫人到乳茶舖子裏坐着，一吃一喝，一談，有個兩三小時，東西全有了，你再大大方方的回營來，那豈不日個樂子？趙自强苦笑着道：營長，你以爲這還是個樂子嗎？寳芳笑道：你不用說什麽閑話了，趕快的回去罷。趙自强經過了這番考慮之後，巳覺得歸心似箭，旣然營長都來催促，自己還躭誤什麽，於是回得連部去，呌司務長帶了幾名弟兄，就一同到海甸來。今天他經過那個曠野時，也不知道寂寞，也不知道悲痛，自然更没有了快樂，就這樣糊裏糊塗的向前走着，到了街上時，指給了司務長幾條門路，讓他去找車，自己却一個人單獨的走回家來。當他向家裏走的時候，自然是開了大步子向前，可是當他到了大門口，兩條腿忽然軟綿綿的，提抬不起。門是關的，自己正要伸手去敲門環，離着還有四五寸遠，就把手縮回來，他想着，見了父親，什麽話都好說。見了這位新岳母，對他說是要出發向喜峯口去了，這不是向人家兜胸打上一拳嗎？見了她的面，還是瞞着不說吧？他這樣的想着，站在門口，就少不得有些猶豫。（二二五）</p>

<h3 id="c277">中國文與中國人 <a href="#c277" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e277" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">277</a></h3>
<p>— 余銘</p>
<p>最近出版了一本很好的翻譯：高本漢著的「中國語和中國文」。高本漢先生是個瑞典人，他的眞姓是珂羅倔倫（Ｋarlgren）。他爲什麽「貴姓」高？那無疑的是因爲中國化了。他的確對於中國語文學有很大的供獻。</p>
<p>但是，他對於中國人似乎更有研究，因此，他很崇拜文言，崇拜中國字，以爲對中國人是不可少的。</p>
<p>他說：「近來丨按高氏這書是一九二三年在倫敦出版的丨某幾種報紙，曾經試用白話，可是並没有多大的成功；因此也許還要觸怒多數定報人，以爲這樣，就是諷示著他們不能看懂文言報呢」！</p>
<p>『西洋各國裏有許多伶人，在他們表演中，他們幾乎隨時可以揷入許多「打諢」，也有許多作者，濫引文書：但是大家都認這種是劣等的風味。這在中國恰好相反，正認爲高妙的文雅而表示絕藝的地方。』</p>
<p>中國文的「含混的地方，中國人不但不因之感受了困難，反而願意養成它。」</p>
<p>可是，高先生自己却因此受夠了侮辱：「本書的著者和親愛的中國人談話，所說給他的，很能完全瞭解；但是，他們彼此談話的時候，他幾乎一句也不懂」。這自然是那些「親愛的中國人」在「諷示」他不懂上流社會的話，因爲「外國人到了中國來，只要注意一點，他就可以覺得：他自己雖然熟悉了普通人的語言，而對於上流社會的談話，還是莫名其妙的。」</p>
<p>於是他就說：「中國文字好像一個美麗可愛的貴婦，西洋文字好像一個有用而不美的賤婢。」</p>
<p>美麗可愛而無用的貴婦的「絕藝」，就在於「揷諢」的含混。這使得西洋第一等的學者，至多也不過抵得上中國的普通人，休想爬進上流社會裏來。這樣，我們「精神上勝利了」。爲要保持這種勝利，必須有高妙文雅的字彙，而且要豐富！五四白話運動的「没有多大成功，」原因大抵就在上流社會怕人諷示他們不懂文言。</p>
<p>雖然，「此亦一是非，彼亦一是非」！丨我們還是含混些好了。否則，反而要感受困難的。</p>

<p>— 曹聚仁</p>
<p>美國有一位科學家Ｓlosson，他打一個鬼算盤、說「Electric」這一個字，要是首創的人就給他個簡單的拼合，二個字母或三個字母，那不知要省下多少鋼筆，多少墨水，多少寫字工夫，多少排字工夫。而我們的陶徒然先生，他却替我的貴姓擔憂，只怕寫成「曲日曹」，少了一筆，就失了什麽尊嚴似的。凡是文字改革，出來反對的總是自命識一些方塊字的知識分子；這無非怕一般人獲得運用文字的機會，而自己的唯一的技倆，全般失去效用，用得重新學習過，又怕重新學習過。嘲笑青年寫别字的下意識，和寳貴文字的心理是相一致的。（土耳其實行文字改革時，知識分子反對最烈；反對國語字音及羅馬字母者亦多知識分子：多識方塊字，爲知識分子唯一財産，故患失之心最重。）</p>
<p>Ｗhitney敎授說：『文字不是屬個人的，是屬社會的各員的。……我們各人所欲說的話，不至他人都採用的時候不能成爲語言文字。語言全部的發達，開端的雖是個人，而完成的却是社會。』所以文字是通用的貨幣，倒閉了的銀行，牠的鈔票决不會有人願意使用的。讀别字寫别字並不是一種偶然的現象，往古來今，上中下各色人等無不如此；我們若不順趨勢以謀補救，如徒然先生所主張隨時加以指正、則「說文淫」下曰；「浸淫隨理也。」此浸淫字。「媱」下曰「私逸也。」奸下曰：「犯媱也。」此貞媱字。」請問徒然先生能執每個讀書人而告之曰：「淫當寫作媱」嗎？錢塘江中流的七里瀧，此「瀧」應讀作「雙」：請問徒然先生能執過往人等而告之曰「瀧應讀作雙」嗎？清嘉慶中，某言官疏稱『京師宣武門，人皆稱順治門：正陽門，人皆稱前門；崇文門，人皆稱哈達門，宜責令改正」。上令其自某日始，至前門逢人辨正。徒然先生熱心指正别字，我倒想鈔此成去請逢人辨正一番！（如「這個」當作「者個」，「徒然」的「然」字，即「燃」字，不當另用「燃」字，「小丑」的「丑」字，當寫「爨」字。）</p>
<p>寫别字讀别字，並不没有規則的。其中十之七八，有聲音上的關係，或同子音，（半雙聲或雙聲）或同母音；如「别字」作「白字」，「别」，「白」雙聲，「爨」作「丑」，「爨」，「丑」雙聲。其餘十之二三，則有字形上的關係，大抵從簡化；如「豆腐」寫作「豆付」，「牛一頭」寫作「牛一豆」，「隂陽」寫作「阾易」，「毫釐」寫作「毛厘」。順着前一個趨勢，可以把中國文字完全改造爲新形聲字；順着後一個趨勢，可以把中國文字完全改造爲簡字。社會的讀别字寫别字，正是改造中國文字的先導，我所以還得張目一下</p>
<p>至於學理上的討論，我將另有一篇長文，寫請徒然先生指敎。（將刊濤聲第七十五期）</p>
<h3 id="c279">孫淵如與黄仲則 <a href="#c279" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e279" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">279</a></h3>
<p>— 朱霞</p>
<p>黄仲則生平的交游甚廣，孫淵如也是一個。往年，讀淵如的『澄清堂稿』，在他爲仲則所寫的諸詩作之中，看到他們彼此間的友誼很是親密，其間，有關於仲則歷史的材料也不少。統計起來，有下列各詩；（一）題黄二所藏黄山圖，（二）潤州舟次偕黄二景仁作，（三）偕楊三（倫）洪大（亮吉）黄二（景仁）放舟看荷至平山堂，（四）黄二景仁由黄山歸索贈長句，（五）答洪大醉後之作兼懷黄仲則，（六）洪大屬題雲溪一曲圖並有黄大景仁影。就在這詩題上，我們也可獲得一些材料。在這些詩歌之中，「黄二景仁遊黄山歸索贈長句」一首，包含史料最多，這詩雖不免是應酬之作，但很可以作爲仲則南遊的結論。仲則的性格，際遇家庭，以至和淵如的交情，南遊歸後的得意，是全都可以看到的。其他詩中，如「看荷至平山堂」中的「一子扣舷二子歌，我手不放金叵羅」，如「兼懷仲則」一詩内的「人生快意如石火，别後相思淚空墮，」如「洪大屬題」詩内的「不憂紫鹿損白祫，但恐鏡沼非紅顔，」以至如「黄山圖」詩中所說，「黄生去後山色死，清水白石哀潺潺。竦身指點舊遊處，出入高下窮艱難，」也都可以作爲仲則歷史參證的資料。</p>

<p>— 異岑</p>
<p>一個從前很要好的朋友，相别數年，不曾能寠消息了，昨天忽然接到他一封信，他說：很羨慕我登在這個天堂似的大都會，料想我是度着很寫意的生活。他還要我不要忘記了他，並託咐我替他介紹工作。</p>
<p>我把這封信讀過一遍後，不覺的苦笑了一陣。我本應馬上回他一封信的，但我實在没有這勇氣。因爲回信應該在信紙上寫些什麽話好呢？我要是把我的近况如實相告吧，他若肯相信我的話時，恐怕會要使得這位多年不見的好友大大的失望。或還要替我生出些不是份内的悲哀來。要是不相信時，那又怕反要使他對我發生些誤解。說我些閒言。處在這麽兩難之中，經過幾番思索，終於决定信還是回。但信上僅僅把當年和他在一塊兒的情景，與許多往事用着生動的字句，描寫一遍，我說：我這一生中，恐怕祗有過去的那個時節才夠得上你所說的「很寫意的生活」。因爲那時剛入社會，世故淺，閱歷少，生的一切艱難，還不十分懂得啊！</p>
<p>我又寫着：你羨慕我登在這個天堂似的地方嗎？不錯，這兒眞是和天堂一般，有高大的洋房，寬廣的馬路。而且馬路上時刻可以看見來往不絕横衝直撞的汽車，裏面坐着一些外國的紳士，貴婦。他們是憑有飛機砲艦作保護，運來各種新奇的物品，騙取了中國人的數不清的金錢，在享樂着。</p>
<p>汽車裏還坐着有特殊階級的本國人，也同樣的威風華貴。因爲他們是憑着本身，或爺老子的機會，會榨取，會刮削，發了盈千累萬的大財！</p>
<p>這兒還有有增無減的靠出賣肉體來生活的女人，面上塗着香粉，身上穿着綢衣，婀娜肉感得迷死人！</p>
<p>還有應時而起的投機家，他們善於體貼人意，迎合時尚，廣設戲院，舞塲，…許許多多說不勝說的誘人的銷金窟！</p>
<p>至關於他所想像底天堂似的地方，另一些人的生活，我始終没有告訴他。因爲我知道另一面的情景寫出來時，一定不及正面的熱鬧。反正同是生在這個時代中的人，難道說還怕不會有領悟的時候嗎？</p>

<p>十分鐘後，他們在樓下那間小飯廳裏用着晚餐。</p>
<p>起初大家都不響；但，過了一會兒，羅蘭老爹又對於公證人的訪問重新發生了疑問。</p>
<p>「究竟他爲什麽不寫信來，而要親自來呢？」</p>
<p>筆爾覺得這事很自然。</p>
<p>「這一定是因爲立刻要一個答覆；並且他也許有些秘密條欵要告訴我們，而這事人家是不大歡喜寫信的。」</p>
<p>可是羅蘭一家四個人還老是在揣測着這事，並且四個人心裏都覺得不該把這不相干的女人邀來晚餐，使得他們不便爭辯並决定一切。</p>
<p>當使女報說公證人到了的時候，他們剛回到二樓的客廳裏。</p>
<p>羅蘭連忙跑近去。</p>
<p>「晚安，親愛的大師（Ｍaitre）。」</p>
<p>他給勒卡魯先生以這「大師」的尊稱，這字原是連接在一切公證人姓名底下的。</p>
<p>陸醉米太太站起身說：</p>
<p>「我回去了，我非常疲倦。」</p>
<p>大家稍爲挽留了一下；但她决意不肯，於是她便一個人走了，不像平時一樣，三個男子裏面總有一個人陪送着。</p>
<p>羅蘭太太急忙走近新來的客人：</p>
<p>「請用一杯咖啡好嗎？」</p>
<p>「不，謝謝你，我剛吃過飯來。」</p>
<p>「那麽，喝一杯茶好嗎？」</p>
<p>「我不說不要，可是稍爲慢一點，我們先來談論事務罷。」</p>
<p>公證人說出這兩句話後，大家便寂然無聲，祗聽到時鐘的有節奏的擺動，和樓底下使女洗刷鍋子的聲響，這使女是蠢到連在門外偷聽都不會的。</p>
<p>公證人再開口說：</p>
<p>「你們在巴黎認識一個呌做瑪賴沙的先生嗎，一個呌做雷恩，瑪賴沙的？」</p>
<p>羅蘭夫婦發出那相同的含着驚歎的答語：確是有的！</p>
<p>「這是你們的一位朋友嗎？」</p>
<p>羅蘭說道：</p>
<p>「最好的朋友。但這一位巴黎狂；他從來不肯離去巴黎的大街。他在財政部當司長。我自從離開京城以後，便没有再看見過他。並且我們早就連音信都斷了。你懂得啦，當彼此離得狠遠……」</p>
<p>公證人便嚴重的說道：</p>
<p>「瑪賴沙先生已經去世了。」</p>
<p>男子和女人都有着這小小的悲傷驚詫的動作，這動作不論是假裝的或眞實的，但當一般人接到這類消息時，總會立刻表現出來的。（未完）</p>

<p>住在上海的三百多萬市民的生活手段，是梯子式的。那層次的多而且濫，實在遠駕乎還未建築完功的四行大厦之上！有人說娼妓所過的是地獄生活，其實，在這生活層次太懸差的上海，娼妓生活，還要算許多層地獄生活的中下層！</p>
<p>現在讓我們摩仿「步步高陞」的方式，把上海人的生活從最低一層開始，一步一步地倒數而間或加以平列地展覽一番：</p>
<p>起碼點以下，自然要數那在街頭巷尾，口裏發出慘厲的呼號，或用磚瓦敲着自己的肉體，或牽着狗沿門下跪，或運着殘斷的肢體滿街打滾，拼着幾滴血和力竭聲嘶的呼號换銅板的乞丐。其他敲着夾板，油鼓筒，沿門唱討的，又略爲「高」一點。至若呌化頭，應該算是在乞丐層裏「住閣樓」的，因爲他下面還有兩三層呢。</p>
<p>再「高陞」一級，應推流氓無産者。在這一個籠統的名詞之下，又要分許多的等級。最起碼，是徘徊於馬路街簷，從菜色的面孔上勉强掛出凄慘的笑容，討索各包飯作的冷菜剩飯的「畢三少爺」。「以上」，有扒手小偷；有以四馬路爲大本營的春宫的販賣者；有出没於北四川路，愛多亞路等處的燕子窩，磨鏡子，羅宋堂子，「清水姑娘」的「嚮導」；有坐茶館，講斤頭的低級白相人，有各種游移不定的小販，有雄據一街的「大亨」。由「大亨」這一條線再逐步高陞上去，「九轉還丹」，幾經修鍊，可以一直陞到陞到ＸＸ，</p>
<p>再右於流氓無産者，就是正式的無産者：有經常把水門汀當作「席夢思」把蔴布口袋當作「外套」的苦力，有黄包車夫，有以「吃生活」倒夜壺爲「中心任務」的徒弟，有小工；有手工業工人，有産業工人。到了工頭和員司，却就完全變質，成爲資本家的「爪子層」，非無産階級矣。</p>
<p>再「高」一點，是店員。由徒弟，大司務，出店，跑街，門市部，賬房等等，其中最高級的，生活不在中等的自由職業者之下，最低的又比工人一樣的苦。</p>
<p>比店員再「高」一級，是中小商人。其中又分若干等級：由大餅油條店，荳腐店的老板，而小烟紙店，雜貨舖，挨次按資本的數額遞升上去。到了公司經理或有巨欵存放銀行，就得另行「銓叙」等級，不得再以「老板」目之了。</p>
<p>另有一級，是自由職業者。從每月拿六元或八元「束修」的小學敎員，薪水十五元到三十元的書記錄事算起，而數字易米的作家之羣，而各機關團體的技術人員……一直依次上升，直到月撈三萬兩萬的「名醫」和「大律師」爲止。這一籠統的名詞之内的層次，又有四倍於「五花肉」的複雜！實在說來，拿標凖以下之薪資的敎員和低級職員，以及經常枵腹，拿腦汁替書買市儈製造財産的無名作家，應該一概名之爲「長衫工人」，他們的經濟地位與生活痛苦，是與工人大衆「二五等於一十」的。最當紅的名醫和大律師，往往兼營地産或據有股票，是道地的資産階級。最苦悶而常不免「打腫了臉充胖子」的，是介乎「長衫工人」與上述那些「兼差」的資本家之間的一大羣：老是載沉載浮，患得患失地在人生的旅程中盤旋着。</p>
<p>再往上昇，就是買辦，官僚，産業或金融的資産階級之羣，如果長袖善舞，再往上爬，就會「偉」了起來而列名於京滬「冠蓋往來」的起居註之中了。同時</p>

<p>(Beiping) Huang Shaoxiong, Zhao Pilian, and others departed from Beiping this afternoon. Huang and his party are divided into military, political, and economic groups to handle affairs. The military group's task is to pay attention to national defense and security; the political group's work is to investigate the past and present situation of Mongolia, and the status of division between flags and counties; the economic group investigates the economic situation of Mongolia. Various League and Banner princes gathering in the Bailingmiao area telegraphed yesterday to Beiping to welcome Huang and Zhao, and sent Bao Yueqing, Temuer Bona, Du Jiayun, and Sulu Dai to Suiyuan to greet them. Wu Heling is traveling with Huang and Zhao. Huang and Zhao plan to stay in Zhangjiakou for a day or two to exchange views with Mongolian banner representatives in Zhangjiakou. Wu will go straight to Suiyuan to make some deployments before Huang and Zhao arrive. The Inner Mongolian personnel accompanying Huang and Zhao this time include Chief of General Affairs Li Songfeng, Secretary of the Xingyuan Zhuo Hongmou, Military Group Leader Liu Puchen, Yang Junli, Cen Weiqiu, Zhang Gengjin, Chi Zhongkuan, Political Group Leader Kong Qingzong, He Yangling, Yang Wenqi, E Qiguang, Ruan Yumin, female secretary Tan Tiwu, Economic Group Leader He Yangling, Kong Qingzong, Xu Xiaolin, Yang Wenxin, Zhao Wenru. (27th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Huang Shaoxiong and Zhao Pilian will first arrive in Zhangjiakou, stop briefly to meet with Mongolian princes and dukes, then go to Suiyuan to meet with Fu Zuoyi, and then proceed to Bailingmiao to discuss the issue of autonomy with Prince Yun, Prince De, etc. The journey will take about a month. After the matter is completed, they will return to Beiping and then to the capital. (27th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Zhangjia visited Huang Shaoxiong today to discuss Mongolian issues, talking for about half an hour. Zhang's entourage, Li Jianzhang, said that Zhangjia felt the dangerous situation of Mongolia after the September 18th Incident. Zhang attended the National Crisis Conference held in Beijing earlier. Subsequently, it was passed by the Plenary Session of the National Government, but the organizational law and outline of the Xuanhua Envoy's Office were not issued to Mount Wutai until September of this year. Because the Mongolian affairs are complicated, Zhang sent personnel to investigate last winter, hoping to turn major issues into minor ones, and minor issues into nothing. Recently, due to the emergence of the autonomy issue, he again sent the chiefs of the general affairs and propaganda sections to Inner Mongolia for inspection a few days ago. Zhangjia decided to go to Inner Mongolia after the personnel return to Beijing and report. Rumors that Zhangjia is obstructing Inner Mongolian autonomy are purely provocative. It should be known that Zhangjia is a religious leader and has no political involvement, so how could he obstruct autonomy? (27th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Panchen Lama sent representatives to Suiyuan to welcome Huang and Zhao. The Panchen is in Bailingmiao, preparing to welcome them. Huang is scheduled to stay in Datong for three days, waiting to meet with Yan to discuss methods of pacifying Inner Mongolia and the Mongolia-Suiyuan region. (27th Special Telegram)</p>

<p>(Beiping) The reorganization of the Chahar province is mostly completed. The Tang's troops stationed in the Chicheng Dushikou area nominally consist of one division, three infantry brigades, and one cavalry brigade. Tang requested full incorporation, but the issue of military pay has not yet been agreed upon. The authorities believe that due to the financial difficulties in North China, even after the downsizing of various armies, the monthly income and expenditure are still significantly insufficient, making it difficult to increase additional expenses. Therefore, the incorporation of Tang's troops has not yet begun. The number of people to be incorporated in the future will be based on the number of people present with firearms during the roll call. Tang's own title has been determined as Commander of Bandit Suppression in Western Chahar. Once the issue of military pay is resolved, it can be announced. (27th Special Telegram)</p>

<p>(Beiping) Yu Xuezhong told reporters that the suppression of bandits in eastern Luan County is proceeding smoothly with our security team's encirclement and suppression, and it will not be difficult to eliminate them in one fell swoop. However, bandit leader Lao Haozi suddenly sought help from the Japanese army, causing Endo, a staff officer of the Japanese army stationed in Yuguan, to hope that we would incorporate them, saying that prolonging the situation would only cause suffering. Previously, we sent Su Yuqi to negotiate with the Kwantung Army, agreeing that if bandits surrendered, they would be disarmed and sent back to their hometowns, and would never be incorporated. Because the security team cannot carry heavy weapons, it cannot limit the date of elimination. I have sent staff officer Zhang Xiguang to Yuguan on the 27th to ask Endo not to interfere with bandit suppression. Su is scheduled to go to Yuguan on the 27th night to ask Endo not to overturn the established plan. Liu Zuozhou, the battalion commander of Li Jichun's troops, also hopes to incorporate Lao Haozi, but I have refused. After the reorganization of the 1,000 troops stationed in Yutian, they have been living in peace. The September military pay will be sent within days. Fucheng County was still in the hands of bandits on the 27th, and the security team did not enter the city. (27th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) After the bandits occupying Fucheng County requested pacification, the security team began to make way on the eastern route to allow refugees to escape first, and then negotiate disarmament and resettlement. The county's public security personnel have arrived in Changli and will soon proceed to take over. After this encirclement, most of the large bandit groups in Fucheng City have fled, and the small groups are negotiating pacification methods. The two sides are still in a standoff, and the security team has not entered the city either. (27th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>Changli Since the start of bandit suppression in eastern Luan County, the progress has been quite tortuous due to the special circumstances in eastern Luan County, so the future cannot be viewed with optimism. In order to facilitate the command of bandit suppression, Zhang Xiguang plans to move the General Headquarters to Changli. Zhang went to Yuguan on the 27th to meet with Staff Officer Endo. If the Japanese side has no objection, it will be moved to Changli within days. The front is still silent. It is reported that Japan has sent more than 100 soldiers to Funing. The bandits in Funing fired two shots at our security team in the afternoon, but no one was injured. County Chief Liu of Funing arrived in Changli in the morning and led the various bureaus to Liushouying in the afternoon. According to people from Fucheng, the bandits' attitude has changed from panic to calm, and they are building fortifications, apparently receiving considerable assistance. (27th Special Telegram)</p>

<p>(Nanchang) According to today's news, after a brief clash between the National Army and the Communist Army, fierce fighting has begun between the two armies in Lichuan, Nanfeng, and Guangchang in eastern Jiangxi, and in Ruijin and Huichang in southern Jiangxi. The Communists are resisting stubbornly, causing heavy casualties on both sides. The details of the battle are unknown. Recently, a tax police regiment of 5,000 people has arrived, carrying 15 field guns, 60 machine guns, 50,000 rifles, 5 armored vehicles, a number of mortars, and 2,000 boxes of hand grenades. It is reported that Chairman Chiang Kai-shek has telegraphed Chen Jitang and Jiang Guangnai, ordering them to move out to the southern route immediately to take concerted action with the Central Army.

<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Finance reorganized the provisional salt tax rate table for various regions. The original plan stated that the reorganization of salt tax emphasizes balance. In the past, local governments in various parts of China collected surcharges to raise funds, resulting in inconsistent tax rates, with some being too high and others too low, leading to cross-border sales and reverse dumping. In the 19th year of the Republic, the National Government ordered the unified collection and reorganization of local surcharges by the Ministry. After the reorganization, a plan to reorganize the tax rates in various production areas was drafted and passed by the Central Conference for implementation last year in May. For a year, tax revenue has increased, and the results have become increasingly apparent. However, the imbalance of salt tax has existed for a long time, and it is impossible to achieve uniformity in one fell swoop. The reorganization of tax rates implemented last year was only a preliminary reorganization of those that were too disparate. It is necessary to observe the situation at any time and gradually improve it. The tax rates that are uneven and the areas where the tax rates are vastly different between adjacent areas will be increased or decreased separately and properly determined. There are two points that need to be clarified: 1. The increase in tax rates in the light tax areas listed in the table will take a gradual approach; 2. The tax reduction areas listed in the table will adopt a method of counting the population and providing food to determine their sales volume. If the sales volume exceeds the quota, the original tax rate will still be charged and must be followed. (27th Special Telegram)</p>

<h3 id="e15">The Issue of Sun's Army Moving Westward <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>— Zi</p>
<p>The theory of "internal pacification must precede resistance against external aggression" has ended its theoretical exploration due to the actual situation. We will now take the facts as a basis and observe national affairs along the path of internal pacification. It seems that the authorities may not have fully exhausted the methods of internal pacification. The so-called methods of internal pacification are, on the one hand, to enable those who are uneasy to return to peace, and on the other hand, not to allow places that can be called peaceful to give rise to unrest. We will not discuss the former for the time being, but the latter can be illustrated by the issue of Sun Dianying's army moving westward.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the incident of Sun's army settling in Qinghai, we can also regard it as a kind of activity of the authorities to carry out internal pacification work. When the situation in Zhangbei was urgent in June, Sun Dianying, with 50,000 troops, was located in the Huailai Shacheng area. If it were to be drawn into the vortex, the situation in Chahar would inevitably become more serious. Giving them funds to enable them to move westward to Qinghai for settlement is also an appropriate measure to improve the situation. However, after Sun's army actually moved westward, Gansu and Qinghai also rose up to make relative representations. Unrest on the other hand gradually formed. To ease and eliminate it was the work that the authorities could not postpone at that time. However, it was delayed for three months, allowing the area that could be called peaceful to increase its unrest. Between late September and early October, Sun's advance team set up a military station in Ningxia. The entire government of Ningxia Province, under the leadership of Chairman Ma Hongkui, resigned in a peaceful rejection. The authorities in Gansu and Qinghai also took concerted action. Fortunately, Sun and Ma still knew to consider the overall situation, and each expressed that they would wait for the decision of the central government. Otherwise, the situation of the Xinjiang dispute might not be difficult to see again on this side. The northwest would have one more unsolvable dispute. This stalemate seems likely to be temporarily maintained. Yesterday's Beiping telegram in this newspaper stated that the Military Affairs Commission had ordered Sun's army to temporarily station in the Wuyuan Linhou area to await orders, and to discuss the method of entering Qinghai after the weather warms in the spring. The representatives of Sun's army in Beiping also stated that due to the weather, they had no choice but to temporarily station in Wuyuan Baotou and wait for orders to move westward after the spring warms. However, maintaining this status quo can only prevent the expansion of unrest, while easing and eliminating it is still not allowed to be delayed.</p>
<p>Qinghai has a vast area of 2,294,400 square li, which is about seven times larger than Jiangsu and Zhejiang. However, the population is less than one million, which is 20 or 30 times less than the 20 million in Zhejiang and the 34 million in Jiangsu. Allowing Sun's army of 50,000 people to enter this sparsely populated area can develop the local area and consolidate the borders. In theory, it is very appropriate. However, when it comes to facts, there are problems of funding and conflicts of interests from all sides. We read Zhu Shaoliang, Ma Lin, Ma Hongkui, and other telegrams presented to the central government, citing the lack of food and the dispute between hosts and guests, asking Sun's troops to move westward slowly or to be transferred elsewhere. The crux of the matter is clearly visible. How will the authorities use the next few months from winter to spring to address this crux, eliminate unrest, and enable Sun's army to achieve its desire to settle in Qinghai?</p>
<p>From the time the order for Sun's army to go to Qinghai was issued in June to the time when the two sides on the border of Ningxia were in a standoff in September, more than three months passed. The authorities had already caused unrest on this side due to the delay. From today to March of next year, the time is even longer, providing ample opportunity to ease and eliminate unrest. The authorities must not err again and again and make this problem an unsolvable situation. We anticipate that the authorities are not unable to understand this obvious crux, but are troubled by the handling of other more significant events, and their energy is insufficient. However, since internal pacification is the goal, it is necessary to prevent this area that can be called peaceful from becoming a major unrest. The Xinjiang dispute, which the authorities are painstakingly dealing with, is a lesson before them.</p>

The pseudo-Ministry of Industry is currently speeding up efforts to prevent the complete bankruptcy of farmers, who account for 85 percent of Manchuria's population. (27th Reuters Telegram)</p>

<p>(Dalian) According to the report of the Local Sanitation Department of the South Manchuria Railway Company, from September to mid-October, there were 311 cases of typhoid fever in major towns along the South Manchuria Railway. Changchun, Shenyang, and Andong are the most affected. The Sanitation Department is making every effort to prevent the spread of this epidemic. The plague in central and western Manchuria has not yet subsided. The epidemic prevention team is still working hard to control it, hoping to end it in November. Dr. Kawakami of the Sanitation Department of the South Manchuria Railway Company returned from the epidemic area and stated that if the epidemic is not eradicated by the end of November, its labor will be further expanded. The main difficulty encountered by the epidemic prevention team is that people do not report infections and go deeper inland to escape the interference of sanitation workers. If it is not eradicated before the arrival of winter, it will be difficult to control. (27th Reuters Telegram)</p>

<p>(Changchun) The Jilin Righteous Army in various places is still resolutely resisting Japan this autumn. The Japanese and puppet troops often fail and return when they go to suppress them. The reason is that the Jilin provincial police officers, although serving in pseudo-positions, have particularly strong patriotic hearts. When they learn that the Japanese and puppet troops are going to suppress them, they secretly inform the Righteous Army to escape in advance, so that the Japanese and puppet troops do not see the shadow of the Righteous Army when they go to suppress them with large forces. Small units that go out never return. The Japanese police authorities hate the patriotic actions of the pseudo-police very much and have sent Section Chief Urashima of the pseudo-Police Department to various counties to investigate and arrest the pseudo-police who are in communication with the Righteous Army. It is said that there is great panic in the pseudo-police circle. (27th Hua Lian Telegram)</p>

<p>(Harbin) According to the local police station of "Manchukuo", 710 White Russians and 400 Red Russians left Harbin between August and September. The average number of people leaving the country this month is 40 per day. Most of them go to China and Japan, and some go to Europe. Most of the White Russians have left, and those who have not left are also preparing to leave. The reason seems to be fear of a conflict between Japan and Russia. In the past, those who left Harbin were all poor people who went to other places to find food, but this time, those who left Harbin are mostly landlords or wealthy businessmen. As for why the Soviet Russian people are leaving the country, the authorities here firmly believe that it is being drafted by the Soviet Russian government to return home for military service.

<p>(Moscow) Soviet Foreign Affairs Commissar Litvinov, accompanied by several staff members, departed for America on the Paris express train tonight. However, the port of embarkation and the ship they will sail on are being kept strictly secret by the government. Mrs. Litvinov did not accompany him tonight, but it is said that she will follow shortly. Narmansky, the head of the Soviet government's information department, also departed on the same train, but he insisted that he was going to Madrid to attend an international parliamentary conference and not to the United States. It is also rumored that External Secretary Divolkovsky will also go to the United States, but whether he accompanied them tonight has not been announced. When Litvinov and his party boarded the train, security was tight, and the departure was kept secret, for reasons unknown. Previously, when Mr. Litvinov visited various European countries, his itinerary was always announced in advance and was not secret at all. Therefore, some quarters are quite surprised by today's situation. Afterwards, the government only announced that the Foreign Affairs Commissar had departed for Washington to negotiate with President Roosevelt on the restoration of US-Soviet trade and diplomatic relations, and said nothing else.</p>

<p>(Washington) The US President today issued an executive order authorizing government mints and assay offices to purchase newly mined gold on behalf of the Finance Rehabilitation Corporation. Today's gold price is set at $31.54, an increase of $0.18 from yesterday. According to official sources, it is hoped that the price of gold can gradually reach a stable level, but for an indefinite period, it will continue to be slightly higher than the world market price. The order issued on August 29, which allowed the Treasury Department and the Finance Rehabilitation Corporation to accept newly produced gold for export abroad at a fixed price, has been revoked, but gold ornaments and gold-plated utensils may still be exported in accordance with the regulations of the Treasury Department. Jones, the general director of the Finance Rehabilitation Corporation, stated that the company will pay for the gold with new 90-day bonds, with an annual interest rate of 0.25%. The purchased gold stored in the mints and government assay offices will be used as collateral for the bonds, which will be redeemed in cash upon maturity, or may be discounted with the Federal Reserve Bank in advance. The price of gold will be announced daily thereafter. However, Jones did not mention the quantity of gold that the United States will purchase. According to other officials, the government will allocate 1 billion dollars for this purpose, and will ask Congress to increase this amount if necessary. (National Telegram, 26th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Although the majority of Congressmen believe in the necessity of currency inflation, it is expected that the House of Representatives in the next Congress may not necessarily demand drastic inflation. After Grenetley inquired about the opinions of Congressmen, among those who responded, 53% favored slight inflation, but the majority still wanted to give the President's new monetary policy a trial opportunity. They are still satisfied with it so far, so they are willing to wait and see the results. The number of those who admitted to wanting drastic inflation was very small. In addition, 26% opposed all inflation, and 20% said they were still studying and had not yet decided on the merits and demerits of currency inflation. Judging from the trend of the answers, the power of the inflationists seems to be gradually weakening. The general opinion is to wait and see the progress of the new gold purchase plan.

<p>(Paris) Sarraut completed the formation of the new cabinet late today and will begin preparing a policy statement to be delivered to the parliament. Sarraut will concurrently serve as Minister of the Navy. Boncour will retain the post of Foreign Minister, former Premier Daladier will serve as Minister of War, and Petry will head the Colonial Ministry. Most other ministers are expected to retain their positions. The new Premier acknowledged that the new government is facing a serious financial situation. Taxpayers are now organizing groups to demand a large reduction in burdens, while members of parliament are opposing the proposals to reduce salaries and cut staff, creating a situation where the government is being attacked from all sides. As for foreign policy issues, they are currently secondary. According to reliable sources, the attitude towards disarmament will remain the same, and the war debt issue will be allowed to run its course. The most important issue at present is balancing the budget and increasing government revenue, but this move will inevitably encounter some opposition, so tonight no one dares to guarantee that the new cabinet will have a better chance of overcoming the difficulties. (National Press Agency Dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The main points of the policy of the new French Premier Sarraut were announced at a party meeting today as follows: (1) Anglo-French amity, (2) Continuation of the traditional Radical Party foreign policy and disarmament conferences, (3) No direct negotiations with Germany, (4) Distrust of the Four-Power Pact, (5) Regarding financial policy as the basis for the survival of the cabinet. The new government will implement a "new resolute policy" for finance, advocating tax cuts to increase revenue, and will strictly crack down on tax evaders, and will propose public works projects.

<p>(Geneva) The main leaders of the Disarmament Conference met tonight and decided to postpone the conference until November 9 so that the representatives could consult with their home governments. Japanese representative Sato stated that the recent discussions at the Disarmament Conference have mostly been related to European issues, and the Japanese representatives have not been heavily involved. On October 12, the situation suddenly changed due to Germany's withdrawal from the League of Nations. However, Europe is still the focus of everyone's attention. These issues must be resolved first before a general discussion can be held, so Japan will continue to remain inactive, waiting for the fundamental and necessary resolutions on European issues. The General Committee has accepted the recommendation of the main leaders to postpone the conference until December 4, and all procedures will be determined by the main leaders. At that time, British representative Eden made an important statement, saying that Germany's withdrawal has made it impossible for the work of the Disarmament Conference to proceed in order. However, the British government believes that while the withdrawal is regrettable, the work of disarmament cannot be stopped and should continue as usual. Stopping eating because of choking is not appropriate. The British government is willing to cooperate with all countries at any time and will determine how to achieve the goals of the conference. The representatives of Czechoslovakia and Turkey, while criticizing the absence of certain relevant countries from the main leaders, all supported the decision to postpone the conference.

<p>Havana The Cuban political situation is deteriorating rapidly. It is generally believed that the government will eventually collapse. The left wing of the ABC party is clearly in control of the situation and has submitted a request to President Samartín in the form of an ultimatum, in order to control the government and reorganize all administrative agencies. Army Chief of Staff Colonel Batista and Galbo, the executive committee member of the former revolutionary committee, have agreed with the left wing of the ABC party to declare a general strike of a revolutionary nature, with a time limit of no more than 48 hours, in order to reorganize the government. There is no certainty as to whether the entire army will be loyal to Batista and Galbo, but there is no other way than to try to use the military. The National Confederation of Labor agrees with the ABC party's position on causing the political crisis. Representatives of the National Confederation of Labor and the Pan-American Federation of Labor, totaling 500 people, have recently resolved to strike, but have not announced the date. The authorities have ordered the arrest of many people as a precaution. The police claim that the ABC party intends to launch a coup in November in conjunction with radical soldiers. Workers from the Havana Tramway Company are expected to join the strike movement. It is generally believed that the only way to resolve the situation at this point is for President Samartín to resign. However, whether the President resigns or not, maintaining local security remains a major problem. Political figures believe that the restoration of security must be achieved through American intervention. However, no one in Cuba is willing to take responsibility for requesting American intervention, and the United States is unwilling to intervene unless it receives a direct request. This is clearly visible. (Havas Dispatch, 26th)</p>

<p>(Chongqing) Liu Xiang believes that the loss of Xuanhua and Suiyuan was due to a surprise attack by bandits taking advantage of Liu Cunhou's lack of preparation, and that they do not have any real strength. He has specifically ordered the commander-in-chief of the Fifth Route Army to recover Xuanhua and Suiyuan by a specific date, and ordered all armies to advance simultaneously and destroy the bandit strongholds, ensuring that they are completely wiped out before being allowed to return. Those who procrastinate or are intentionally timid will be reported to the central government for punishment without leniency. (Central News Agency Dispatch, 27th)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The two administrations of the Nanjing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou Railways are currently striving to repay their debts. As of the end of last year, one debt totaling over 476,400 yuan has already been successively paid off. Another debt, related to material arrears, amounted to over 903,690 yuan, of which over 721,540 yuan had been repaid by the end of September this year. There are still substantial outstanding debts owed to the British &amp; Chinese Corporation. These debts are being repaid through deductions from daily operating income, with a certain percentage allocated for this purpose. The Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway also allocates 10 percent, approximately 50,000 yuan per month. However, starting from June of this year, this has been increased to 20 percent, approximately 100,000 yuan per month. The Nanjing-Shanghai Railway originally allocated 5 percent, also approximately 50,000 yuan per month, but from October 1st, this was increased to 7.5 percent, approximately 70,000 yuan per month. Therefore, the two railways will now jointly repay foreign debts at a rate of 170,000 yuan per month, which may be further increased in the future. The full repayment of outstanding debts to the British &amp; Chinese Corporation should not be far off. (27th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Hankou) He Jian arrived in Hankou at 8 PM on the 27th via the Jiang'an vessel, coming from Xun. Important figures from the Wuhan military and political circles went to the pier to welcome him. After disembarking, He went to the Fourth Route Army's office in Hankou for rest and met with He Chengjun, Zhang Qun, and others for several hours. According to He's statement to reporters, he reported to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek in Jiangxi about his inspection of western Jiangxi and presented a plan for clearing and pacifying the west in the future. All points related to the north and south routes have been specified. The central government currently subsidizes 100,000 yuan per month for the military expenses of suppressing bandits in the west, which is far from sufficient. Chiang promised to find ways to increase it in the future. The suppression of bandits north of Jiangxi is proceeding very smoothly, and the future looks optimistic. One million dan of surplus grain from Hunan is being transported to Guangdong in batches. Construction of the Hongbin light railway can proceed because the central government has approved the issuance of 10 million yuan in public construction bonds by the province. Regarding the issue of selling American cotton and wheat after their arrival in China, although various provinces have requested allocations for construction, it is not yet under discussion due to difficulties in sales. Some people believe that the location for establishing a steel and iron factory in Zhuzhou is not suitable and is still under study. He is scheduled to cross the river on the 28th to visit Zhang Qun for further detailed discussions, and then return to Changsha by special train on the 29th. He Hao Ruo and Zhang Kailian returned to Hankou from Jiangxi on the same ship as He. (27th Central Telegram)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The Guide Huai River Committee is seeking to borrow 8 million yuan from the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Committee to manage the waterways around Shaobo and Huaiyin and to construct dams in both locations. However, the repayment of interest and principal can only be guaranteed after the project is completed. During the initial two years, which will be the construction period, there will be no source of funds for interest payments. Because the Boxer Indemnity Committee requires a formal guarantee of interest and principal from the Ministry of Finance before allocating funds, the matter has been shelved. The Committee has consulted with the Ministry of Finance several times. The Ministry of Finance intends to provide a limited-term guarantee, and once the Shaobo, Huaiyin, and Jiangbei active dams are completed, it will transfer shipping tax revenue to repay the interest and principal. A draft agreement is currently being discussed. (27th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The Military Affairs Commission has requested the Central Government to transfer the Aviation Administration from the Ministry of Military Administration to its direct jurisdiction. After deliberation by the Central Political Council, the decision was made to review the request after the organizational law of the Military Affairs Commission is passed. According to the person in charge of the Aviation Administration, this proposal has been under discussion for a long time. Because the authorities of the Military Affairs Commission are currently in a period of bandit suppression, direct jurisdiction is necessary for convenient mobilization. Furthermore, the duties of the Aviation Administration encompass both military and administrative matters, which is slightly different from the nature of the Army Administration. The Military Affairs Commission is responsible for military orders throughout the country, so it is natural for the Aviation Administration to be under its jurisdiction. (27th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) On the evening of the 26th, five bandits broke into the Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company, brandishing pistols. Coincidentally, there was a large leather bag on the table containing miscellaneous documents. The bandits mistakenly thought it was filled with cash, seized it, and fled. A tea boy reported to the police, and the bandits dispersed and fled through the east side door. The chief of the Fourth Precinct of the Second Police Bureau, located across from the company, dispatched all personnel and arrested Li Qingxin, one of the bandits carrying the stolen bag and wearing the badge of the Executive Yuan. The rest escaped without a trace. Shortly after, Gu Shouchang, Xia Yuwan, Ren Wenshi, and Wu Yingfu, four staff members from the National Government's Directorate-General of Budget, Accounts and Statistics, were mistakenly arrested by the police because they were going to Lao Wanquan for a wedding feast. Chen Qicai, the Director-General, personally went to the police station to explain the situation, and they were released. The bandit Li Qingxin, a native of Guizhou, is 29 years old and formerly served as a battalion commander in the 10th Army of the National Revolutionary Army. He is currently unemployed and resides at No. 59 Liji Alley. He was wearing a serge suit when arrested and appeared calm, with a badge from the Executive Yuan, No. 106, pinned to his chest, making him look like a government employee. After taking his statement, the judicial department dispatched detectives to search the location provided by Li. The location was a two-story single building. Li and his fellow villager Yang Fang lived upstairs, while Yang's fellow villagers, a husband and wife named Yang Gang, lived downstairs. When they went to search, Yang and the others had already fled with their belongings. Only a maid was arrested and taken to the police station for questioning. (27th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Since the September 18th Incident, the Beining Railway has been cut into two sections by the Japanese and their puppets at Shanhaiguan. The section outside the pass has been renamed the Fengshan Railway, preventing direct traffic between Ping and Yuan for a long time. A spokesperson for the Ministry of Railways stated that although the Railway Administration has repeatedly negotiated with the Japanese and their puppets, the conditions set by the puppet state are extremely harsh, and they are unwilling to allow the Beining Railway Administration to resume traffic. This has led to no results for both sides. Recently, the Ministry of Railways appointed Yin Tong, a former member of the Beining Railway Reception Committee, as the Director of the Beining Railway Administration. Yin has taken office and begun negotiations with the Japanese and their puppets to resume traffic under conditions that do not conflict with the rights of both parties. There are rumors that the Beining Railway will open international trains as a buffer, but there is currently no such proposal. (27th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Tianjin) Yin Tong went to the Beining Railway Bureau on the morning of the 27th to take office, handing over from Deputy Director Lao Mian. He then summoned all the staff to speak, saying that since the September 18th Incident, the business of Beining has been greatly affected, and we should all be enthusiastic to maintain it to the end. He said he was determined not to employ private individuals, and would not easily change the old people, hoping that each would serve with peace of mind. Yin told reporters that the issue of direct train service to Shenyang was still under study. Our attitude is that we believe that train service should follow the inherent route of Beining under the principle of not recognizing the puppet state, but absolutely prevent puppet Fengshan railway vehicles from entering Guan Nei.

<h3 id="e95">Ethnic Groups in Xinjiang's Troubled Situation: Approximately 2.5 Million in the Entire Province, with the Hui People Holding the Greatest Influence <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>Dihua Correspondence: Xinjiang has a vast area and a sparse population, with a particularly complex mix of ethnicities. Historically, issues in the northwest border region have often stemmed from this complex ethnic makeup, and the current unrest in the province is no exception. The importance of the relationships between these ethnic groups is self-evident. According to a survey conducted in 1922, the total population was approximately 2.5 million, though this figure is unreliable. In recent years, there have been no accurate figures, so it is impossible to know how the population has increased or decreased. Among the various ethnic groups, the Hui people wield the greatest influence, including various groups such as the Inner and Outer Sart, Turkic, Kazakh, Burut, and Gansu Hui. Other groups, such as Han, Manchu, and Mongol, constitute a very small portion of the population. The following is a survey:</p>
<p>Hui People: They are a powerful ethnic group in the province and are quite complex. The Sart, also known as the Kashgar people, are more numerous and reside in the southern region of the Tianshan Mountains. They are of Turkic origin. The Turkic people, also known as the Tajik, and the Kazakh and Burut, mostly reside in the northern region of the Tianshan Mountains.</p>
<p>Han People: They mostly live in Dihua and originate from various inland provinces. They are primarily merchants.</p>
<p>Manchu People: They mostly live in the Yili region and are descendants of those who were relocated there in the past.</p>
<p>Mongol People: They are scattered in the northeastern region and mostly practice Lamaism. Some also follow Islam.</p>
<h3 id="e96">North China's Diplomacy with Japan: The War Zone Issue Is Gradually Being Resolved; Yoshi's Presence in Beiping is Highly Notable <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>Beiping Correspondence: The complex and intricate diplomacy in North China is currently being resolved. Regarding various issues in the war zone, those of a local nature are being discussed by officials from the North China authorities and the Japanese Kwantung Army. For example, bandit suppression in eastern Hebei has been agreed upon. The fact that the security forces were twice obstructed can be seen as an admission by the instigators themselves. They have now been allowed to proceed eastward after reaching a so-called understanding. They have been suppressing bandits for days, and the area near the railway has been pacified. The bandits in Funing are also surrounded and in dire straits, requesting to be incorporated. The return of the various passes along the Great Wall, as well as customs and postal services, is also being discussed. The Japanese Kwantung Army originally intended to send Okamura Yasuji to Beiping again for negotiations, but this plan was temporarily suspended to avoid outside attention. However, in order to understand the situation in Beiping and discuss certain issues, they specially sent a plane from the puppet state's Manchuria Railway Company to Beiping to pick up Shibayama, the military attache of the Japanese embassy, and take him to Changchun for discussions. Shibayama has been gone for two days and has not yet returned to Beiping. The puppet state's Manchuria Railway Company plane has arrived twice, once to pick up Kita Kiyoshi and once to pick up Shibayama. The repeated dispatch of this plane to Beiping by the Japanese is intentionally or unintentionally significant. Tracing back to before the Yuguan Incident, a puppet flag was first hung on a train on the Fengshan Railway, which then proceeded directly to Yuguan. Then, under the pretext of train operations, they occupied the station buildings and raised a puppet flag at Yuguan. Subsequently, they dispatched puppet state police to occupy Yuguan by force. Past events are clear and can be reviewed. The repeated dispatch of the puppet state plane to Beiping, allowing the bizarre and dazzling puppet flag to first appear over the ancient capital, has a purpose that can be inferred.</p>
<p>Since local issues are being discussed with the Japanese Kwantung Army, various issues related to overall diplomacy are also being studied to find solutions. When Japanese envoy Yoshi arrived in Beiping, he stayed indoors to show that he had no role in Beiping. However, the day before yesterday, he met with the authorities, and yesterday, under the guise of recreation, he moved to the Summer Palace to facilitate discussions. Yoshi's main task here is not to solve practical problems but to explore ways to solve them. In reality, if Japan does not abandon its policy of aggression, it will be difficult for our country to achieve good results even through negotiations. (October 26)</p>
<h3 id="e97">Peng Dehuai's Raids on Xiaoshi Suffer a Crushing Defeat; Economic Panic in Bandit Areas Leads to Roadblocks and Forced Donations; Chiang Orders Commendation of the 3rd Security Regiment <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: Xiaoshi is the main route to Lichuan. To defend Lichuan, Xiaoshi must be secured. After the recapture of Lichuan, the headquarters immediately telegraphed the entire Huang Division to station there and take charge of security. Many guerrillas and scattered bandits were captured one after another. After bandit leader Peng Dehuai learned of this, he personally led the entire 37th and 25th Corps, as well as a part of the 5th Corps, numbering about 30,000 to 40,000, with about half of them armed, and besieged Xiaoshi on three sides, hoping to cut off the traffic between Nanchang and Lichuan. From the 9th, a portion of the bandits occupied Hongmenshi behind Xiaoshi, another portion cut off communication with Xinfeng, and the main force of the bandit army launched a three-sided encirclement attack on the division's positions. Peng's bandits set up command in a temple on a mountain opposite the town. The Huang Division responded calmly, ordering all officers above the rank of sergeant to perform internal duties and instructing them not to attack until the bandits were within a certain distance. From the evening of the 10th, the bandits launched four or five assaults every night. The Huang Division waited until they were close before opening fire, killing countless bandits. On the night of the 14th, the bandits set fire to the mountains and forests, using the flames to disturb the morale of our troops. Then, Peng personally led a charge. The entire Huang Division fought back. By dawn, the 1st Regiment of the Huang Division broke through and surrounded the right wing of the bandits, killing a bandit army's puppet regimental commander. The bandits' order was greatly disrupted. Peng knew that the situation was hopeless and retreated in panic, abandoning a large number of weapons and ammunition. In summary, the division's defense of Xiaoshi involved five days and nights of hard fighting, resulting in the death of over 1,000 bandits and the capture of over 400. According to the captured prisoners, the number of wounded and escaped bandits was over 2,000. Over 200 rifles and over 1,000 rounds of ammunition were seized. The division also lost one company commander and suffered over 50 casualties among officers and soldiers. Currently, there are no bandit traces in the Hongmenshi and Xiaoshi area.</p>
<p>Military News: According to refugees who recently escaped from bandit areas, the bandits, due to economic panic, have set up checkpoints at various key land and water crossings in the bandit areas and forcibly collect taxes. All goods are subject to taxation. The tax rates are: 2 yuan per 100 jin of tea oil and salt, 8 jiao per shi of rice, and 5 jiao per bolt of cloth. Recently, they also forcibly issued 500,000 yuan in puppet government bonds. All so-called "rich peasants" have their houses, land, and household goods confiscated and are expelled from the area.</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang, upon receiving reports that the 3rd Security Regiment and the Lichuan Guerrilla Force bravely suppressed bandits in the Zuofangwei area near Jinxi, killing many and seizing a large number of firearms and ammunition, issued an order of commendation to encourage them. Yesterday, he specifically telegraphed Chairman Xiong and the general commanders of various routes, instructing them to inform all subordinates. The telegram stated: "Chairman Xiong of Nanchang, General Commander Chen of Xingan, General Commander Zhao of Guangxin: Regarding the recent attack by the 7th Bandit Corps on the 3rd Security Regiment of Jiangxi and the Lichuan Guerrilla Force in the Zuofangwei area near Jinxi, these units bravely fought back, killing many bandits and seizing rifles, machine guns, and other items. They should be commended to encourage them. It is imperative that all subordinates be informed accordingly. Signed: Chiang Kai-shek." (October 24, Datong News Agency)</p>
<h3 id="e98">Four Counties in Western Shandong Appeal for a Swift Plugging of the Changyuan Breach and Request to Be Designated as Extremely Severe Disaster Areas; Representatives from the Four Counties Arrive in Jinan and Will Travel to Beijing and Tianjin <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Representatives from the disaster-stricken areas of Puyang, Fanxian, Shouyang, and Yanggu counties in western Shandong, Jiang Mingqian, Liu Qingxi, Zhang Jianling, Tan Xuezhi, Liu Xuting, and others, arrived in Jinan by boat along the Yellow River this morning (25th). They are scheduled to meet with Han Fuju tomorrow to report on the recent disaster situation in these counties and request that he telegraph Yu Xuezhong, the chairman of the Hebei Provincial Government, to promptly plug the breach at Changyuan. They also plan to go to Nanjing to present their case to the Yellow River Disaster Relief Commission and finally go to Tianjin to meet with Yu Xuezhong to request the plugging of the Changyuan breach. The representatives are also carrying a petition to the provincial government. According to the representatives, the recent disaster situation in western Shandong and the purpose of their visit to Jinan can be summarized as follows: "We have come to Jinan to request two things: (1) To request the prompt plugging of the breach at Changyuan. Since the project to close the breach at Xiaopangzhuang has already begun, if the breach there is closed, the Yellow River water upstream will flow entirely into Puyang, Fanxian, Shouyang, and Yanggu counties, and our counties will suffer even more severe disasters. Since the frost season has already arrived, the water level has slightly decreased, making the Changyuan breach easier to plug and allowing for twice the result with half the effort. If we wait until the winter flood or spring flood season, the river water will gradually rise, making it difficult to plug. Although the people of the four counties are currently in the disaster area, they can still escape by boat. However, if it freezes in the severe winter, it will be difficult for the disaster victims to escape. If the authorities do not promptly plug the breach now, the four counties may become the new course of the Yellow River in the future. Our visit to Jinan is to meet with Chairman Han, requesting that he telegraph Chairman Yu of Hebei Province, instructing the Hebei River Affairs Bureau to promptly plug the Changyuan breach. (2) The water level in Puyang, Fanxian, Shouyang, and Yanggu counties has not yet receded. The other counties have already planted wheat seeds and can maintain their livelihoods next year. Puyang, Fanxian, Shouyang, and Yanggu counties have not been able to plant wheat seeds, so there will be no harvest next year, and the disaster victims will have no way to maintain their livelihoods. Although our counties have been classified as Class A disaster areas by the Relief Association, the disaster situation is more severe than in other counties, so we specifically request to be classified as extremely severe disaster areas. We will meet with Chairman Han tomorrow, and after obtaining satisfactory results, we will go to Beijing and Nanjing to present our case to the central government and the Yellow River Water Disaster Relief Commission and the Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission. After returning to Jinan, we will go to Tianjin to meet with Chairman Yu, requesting that the Changyuan breach be plugged this autumn."</p>
<p>The Petition from the Representatives of the Four Counties to Han Fuju: (1) "Regarding the urgent plea for the rapid blocking of the Yellow River's breach on the north bank to avert a great catastrophe and save the disaster-stricken people. Since the Yellow River breached the north bank of Changyuan County in Hebei Province, the water has poured out, inundating various counties in western Shandong, resulting in an unprecedented and terrible disaster. Fortunately, we have received repeated relief, allowing us to survive. All disaster victims are grateful. However, we recently heard that the construction to block the breach has already started on the south bank, but has not yet begun on the north bank. The disaster victims in the flooded area are eagerly hoping for rescue, and they are greatly disturbed. Now that the frost season has arrived, the water level has slightly decreased. If we take advantage of this opportunity to block the breach, we can achieve twice the result with half the effort, benefiting both the economy and time. If we wait until next year to start construction, after the breach on the south bank is blocked, the river will inevitably flow north, and in the future, during the winter and spring floods, the river water will surge, making it more difficult to manage the breach. If the Yellow River changes its course, the golden dike collapses, and the raging waves surge directly into Tianjin and Beijing, the devastation would be unimaginable. After much deliberation, the people have once again elected representatives to come and present their case, appealing to Your Excellency to quickly find a way to block the breach in Changyuan County to avert a great catastrophe and save the disaster-stricken people. We await your command with utmost supplication." (2) "Regarding the extremely severe disaster situation in Puyang, Fanxian, Shouyang, and Yanggu, where planting is impossible and we appeal for extraordinary relief to save future generations and avoid starvation. The four counties are located in low-lying areas in the middle of the river bend. When the Yellow River breached at Shitou Village in Changyuan this time, the water flooded into the province. At that time, the water depth in the flat areas was more than one zhang. Now that the frost season has arrived, the water is receding, but the water depth in the flat areas of the four counties is still more than five chi, forming a vast expanse of water, like a lake. There are more than 1,400 villages, and over 400,000 disaster victims are still living in the midst of the floods, with no hope of planting and no way to make a living. Among the disaster-stricken counties in western Shandong, this is the most severely affected area. We have received repeated emergency relief, which has allowed us to survive, but it is ultimately a drop in the bucket, only temporarily saving us. Soon it will be freezing winter, and transportation will be cut off. If we do not make plans soon, there will be starvation. Therefore, the representatives of the disaster victims earnestly appeal to Your Excellency to consider classifying Puyang, Fanxian, Shouyang, and Yanggu counties as special disaster areas, providing extraordinary relief to save the hungry and drowning and avert a great catastrophe. We await your command with utmost gratitude." (25th)</p>
<h3 id="e99">Director Zhao of the Jiangsu Finance Department Discusses Relief for Rural Finance; First Borrowing 2 Million Yuan from Various Banks; Government Will Purchase Food or Handle Storage and Pledging <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Government regards the relief of rural finance as the only important political matter at present, and thus established a Rural Finance Relief Committee. According to Zhao Dihua, the director of the Finance Department, the progress of rural financial relief is as follows: It is planned to temporarily raise 2 million yuan by borrowing from banks using a portion of the old land tax arrears from before 1931 as collateral, with 1 million yuan each for Jiangnan and Jiangbei. It will be implemented first in counties with convenient transportation and important towns. The method will be for the government to purchase food, or for banks to handle storage and pledging and establish warehouses. As for the warehouse buildings, existing warehouses and government-owned buildings will be used. Orders have been issued to various counties to quickly investigate and report. Regarding the management of the warehouses, the Finance Department, the county government, and the lending bank will jointly send personnel to be responsible for safekeeping. In addition to the chairman and the heads of the Finance and Construction Departments serving as ex-officio members, the remaining members will be responsible for design and must be experts in rural economics, numbering between nine and eleven people. They are currently being selected and are expected to be officially established around the first of next month. The internal staff will be drawn from the government departments to save money. Although there will inevitably be many difficulties in the implementation of this matter, for the sake of relieving the rural areas, we should design it carefully in order to avoid problems.</p>

He paid two yuan for the room. At around 11 p.m., he went to sleep. At around 10 a.m. yesterday, the waiter Wang Quanlin became suspicious because he had not seen the guest get up for a long time and called out to him without getting a response. He peeked through the window and saw Zhou lying on the bed, his face pale, with black liquid flowing from his mouth. He knew that he had taken poison and immediately reported it to the clerk Zhang Taifei, who broke down the door and entered, only to find that Zhou had already died.

The department delegated an investigation to the county, and all involved parties unanimously denied the accusations. Furthermore, the accuser, Ji Shangying, was unable to provide evidence for each accusation. Therefore, the provincial committee replied that the accusations were untrue, and the Department of Civil Affairs ordered former County Magistrate Wu to investigate Ji. Wu then detained Ji in the county, placing him in shackles and imprisonment. Subsequently, Ji's family requested a transfer of jurisdiction. After much delay, Wu had already left office.

<p>Misunderstanding over conscription in Shangyu leads to a market strike.</p>
<p>On the morning of the 25th, the county government received a telegram from the Department of Civil Affairs, ordering the recruitment and transport of 100 soldiers to the province for deployment to the war zone. At approximately 12:00 PM on the same day, the county defense force's core team and the Public Security Bureau's military police were ordered to begin conscription in the city center. The sudden disorder led to a misunderstanding among the merchants, who believed that this action would greatly affect business as the Autumn Industry and Commerce Recreational Fair on the twelfth day of the ninth lunar month (according to the old calendar) was fast approaching. They gathered at the county chamber of commerce, demanding appropriate guarantees. As Chairman Liu Jie'an and Vice Chairman Zhu Songsan were away in Shanghai for business, the executive committee members Fang Boliang, Fu Ruming, Zhao Qingbao, and Xu Xinifu were publicly elected to go to the county government to request County Magistrate Chen Daxun to stop the conscription. County Magistrate Chen, citing the urgent orders received, was unwilling to abandon the effort for minor issues, lest he delay military affairs. He agreed to allow the release of anyone with a profession who had been wrongly conscripted on bail. As the representatives were about to leave, a soldier of the county defense force's core team, named Jia, refused to release conscripted merchants at the marketplace after repeated requests from the public, and instead lashed out with a whip, provoking public outrage. This led to a market strike. Later, the county magistrate personally persuaded the merchants to open their shops and guaranteed that there would be no more conscription in the city center, and the market then returned to normal.</p>

<p>After Song Ziwen tendered his resignation, the Central Government decided to earnestly persuade him to stay. A financial solution is being negotiated, and Song's resignation may be withdrawn. Song Meiling had visited Shanghai and flew to Jiangxi yesterday morning. Song's associates indicated yesterday that Western newspapers' reports are largely speculation.</p>
<p>Rumors of Finance Minister Song Ziwen's passive resignation have repeatedly surfaced and been denied. Recently, the rumors have resurfaced, although Song's associates have tried to dispel them, they have not been quelled. Yesterday morning, reporters from various newspapers visited Song but did not meet him. Song sent a representative to meet with them, who again denied the resignation news reported by the North-China Daily News, claiming it was pure speculation and not information released by the Ministry of Finance. However, various sources confirm that Song's resignation was submitted to the Central Government on the 25th. The Central Government immediately and earnestly urged him to stay, and it is hoped that the resignation will be withdrawn. The following is a summary of various reports:</p>

<p>Central Government’s Persuasion May Lead to Withdrawal</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, reporters from various newspapers visited Song's residence. There were many visitors at the time, so they submitted written inquiries about Song's intentions to retire. Song sent Qin Yingchun, a counselor from the Ministry of Finance, to meet with the reporters, who stated, "The report in the Western newspapers about resigning from the position of Finance Minister is mostly speculation and not accurate information from the Ministry of Finance." There was no clear statement regarding the resignation. The reporters then asked Qin to inquire with Song about "resigning or not resigning," but Qin declined, citing "the Minister is busy" and "the Minister has not made a clear statement and instructed the reporters not to answer without authorization." Reporters from this newspaper inquired from various sources yesterday. Song felt that there were no solutions to the financial problems and that the expenses for suppressing the Red Army were enormous and difficult to manage. Therefore, he submitted his resignation to the Central Government on the 25th, requesting to be relieved of all his positions. The Central Government has earnestly urged him to stay, and it is hoped that Song will withdraw his resignation.</p>

At 3:30 PM, Shanghai Mayor Wu Tiecheng was received by a counselor. It is reported that Li Shizeng and Wu Tiecheng came to persuade Song, asking him to persevere despite the difficulties and promising that solutions to the financial problems would be found. Song's resignation has become a problem.</p>

<p>Previously, when rumors of the resignations of Chiang, Wang, and Song were circulating, Madam Chiang Song Meiling hurriedly came to Shanghai, drawing more attention from the public. Today, Madam Chiang hurriedly flew from Jiangxi to Shanghai. After Song personally visited Chiang's residence on Jailier Road on the evening of the day before yesterday, Madam Chiang went to Hongqiao Airport at 8:30 AM yesterday and returned to Jiangxi by Sikorsky aircraft. According to general speculation, Song Meiling came to Shanghai to convey messages between Chiang and Song due to Finance Minister Song Ziwen's resignation.</p>

<p>Wang Kemin Will Return North Tomorrow</p>
<p>At 11:00 AM yesterday, Wang Kemin visited Song and then left. Reporters asked him about the outcome of the discussions on the financial situation in North China. Wang stated that the financial situation in North China is now being handled by the Ministry of Finance, so all details should be inquired from the Ministry of Finance for more information. There seemed to be something he was reluctant to explain. When asked when he would return north, Wang replied that he would wait until his affairs were completed and then decide to leave Shanghai the day after tomorrow (i.e., the 29th), first going to Nanjing and then returning north. Subsequently, Hu Bijang, President of the Central South Bank, left. When asked about Song's resignation and the Ministry of Finance's recent negotiations with Shanghai banks for loans, Hu stated that there had been no recent borrowing from the banking community. Regarding Song's resignation, Hu still denied it, saying that Song's resignation was unlikely to happen so quickly. It was also reported that Song's intention to retire this time was indeed not without cause, but it is expected that during this time of national crisis, the Central Government relies heavily on Song, such as the progress of the Economic Commission for the Unified National Economy and technical cooperation with the League of Nations, all of which require Song to jointly plan and preside over. Therefore, no matter what, efforts will be made to persuade him to stay and not allow him to retire. Moreover, Song has always been willing to take responsibility and serve the country. After the Central Government persuades him to stay and finds appropriate solutions to the financial problems, it is hoped that he will withdraw his resignation.</p>

<p>Zhang Zhenhua Discusses the Situation of Overseas Chinese in Siam: Four Revolutions Succeed Bloodlessly; Overseas Chinese Control Most of the Country's Commerce</p>
<p>Siam is an independent country in Asia. It has recently experienced four revolutionary trends. As the international situation is urgent, all countries are paying attention to it. Recently, Zhang Zhenhua, a prominent overseas Chinese figure in Siam, returned to China for business. Yesterday, he arrived in Shanghai by ship. A reporter from the Min Yan News Agency met with Zhang at his residence and discussed Siam's domestic and foreign affairs and the situation of overseas Chinese. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e121">四次革命兵不血刃 <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>Four Revolutions Without Bloodshed</p>
<p>There have been four revolutions in Siam. The reasons for the revolutions are that Siam's politics are corrupt and society is dark. A group of passionate young people raised the banner of rebellion, and the whole country responded. The revolutions succeeded without bloodshed. However, because the revolutions were not thorough, they were overthrown after being established. This time, the Siamese prince led a large army to Bangkok. Although there was a conflict, the revolutionary army quickly retreated, so the people did not suffer any major losses.</p>
<h3 id="e122">外交政策傾向日本 <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>Foreign Policy Leans Towards Japan</p>
<p>The Siamese prince studied in England. Since returning to the country and taking office, he has modeled many political affairs after England. However, due to environmental factors, he is bound by Japan everywhere. All agencies have Japanese advisors, so although there are only 300 Japanese in Siam, they have considerable influence in politics. Even the Siamese king has almost become a puppet. The last time the Siamese king traveled to the United States, he passed through China, but due to Japanese surveillance, he did not go ashore. The last time the League of Nations sanctioned Japan for invading Northeast China, the Siamese representative gave up the right to vote due to this relationship. Most of the current revolutionaries are students who studied in France and are trying to overthrow Japan's potential influence. This time, when the prince led his army to Bangkok, there were also Japanese advisors participating in military affairs.</p>

<p>Overseas Chinese Education is Relatively Developed</p>
<p>The total population of Siam is 20 million, and overseas Chinese account for about one-sixth, totaling 3 million. Overseas Chinese have founded hundreds of schools in Siam. There are 53 schools in Bangkok. The highest institutions of learning are the Zhonghua Middle School and the Overseas Chinese Middle School founded by the General Chamber of Commerce. Overseas Chinese children who continue their studies to seek further education return to China to enter Jinan University, Guangdong's Zhongshan University, and Lingnan University. However, in recent years, Siam has planned to incorporate Chinese people into Siamese nationality, so all schools are forced to learn Siamese, and at a certain age, they must undergo military service.</p>

<p>Overseas Chinese Control Most of the Country's Commerce</p>
<p>Siam produces abundant rice, and tens of millions of stones are exported to various countries every year. Most of the rice mills in Siam were founded by Chinese. Other timber mills are almost entirely operated by Chinese. Very few Siamese engage in commerce. However, China and Siam have no commercial treaty, so overseas Chinese in Siam have become stateless nationals and are oppressed everywhere. They are subject to various taxes, such as business income tax, head tax, and immigration tax, to extract money from overseas Chinese. Moreover, all business ledgers are required to be in Siamese. Although China has repeatedly negotiated with the country for the past twenty-two years to urge the signing of a commercial treaty, no treaty has been signed to date, leaving 3 million overseas Chinese in Siam without the protection of their home country.</p>

<p>Caring for the Motherland, They Often Donate Large Sums</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese in Siam are often oppressed by foreigners, so they are deeply concerned about the situation in their home country. During the great floods in China in 1931, even though the local government ordered them not to donate to disaster relief, most still secretly carried out the donation and transported it to China, amounting to millions. They were particularly enthusiastic about donating to the volunteer army. Unfortunately, China has had many events over the years, and the political situation is not good, so it has failed to protect overseas Chinese who care about their home country. Zhang concluded by saying that his return to China this time is to follow the wishes of the overseas Chinese and urge the government to earnestly negotiate a commercial treaty with Siam, so that 3 million overseas Chinese can receive the benefits of their home country as soon as possible.</p>

The committee has sent letters to domestic experts, urging them to take on the task of setting the topics.</p>

<p>According to the Da Mei Evening News, today (the 27th) is United States Navy Day, commemorating the Continental Congress's approval of the construction of the first warships in 1775 and the birthday of former President Roosevelt, who laid the foundation for a major expansion of the modern navy. Therefore, naval vessels in various parts of the United States held celebrations.

<p>Five Patrol Ships of the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Fisheries Bureau Departed Yesterday to Protect Fishing; Reiterate Previous Orders Not to Solicit Ocean Protection Fees</p>
<p>In order to promote the development of fisheries, the Ministry of Industry established the Fisheries Improvement Association this spring. To implement the construction, the original fishing tax, license tax, and ocean protection fee were abolished and replaced with a construction fee. The intention was to use the construction fee revenue to carry out construction, but due to the opposition of merchants, it did not achieve much results. Therefore, the original plan could not be realized. Now is the autumn fishing season, and the Ministry of Industry is afraid that things will be delayed for a long time, so it ordered the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Marine Fisheries Administration not to solicit license tax and ocean protection fees, and notified fishermen that there is no need to pay. The bureau's ocean protection patrol ships Haihu, Haihong, Haiying, Biaohai, and the newly prepared Qing'an, a total of five ships, departed yesterday to protect fishing. In addition to Biaohai patrolling various areas, the remaining four ships will be stationed at their original locations.</p>

<p>Revised Method of Inter-Railway Transportation of Materials; Ministry of Railways Orders Bureaus to Comply</p>
<p>The Shanghai-Nanjing-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administration received instructions from the Ministry of Railways stating that the 16th National Intermodal Transport Conference discussed and resolved the proposal to change the method of charging for inter-railway transportation of materials. The Intermodal Transport Department proposed changing the method of charging for inter-railway transportation of materials in principle. After the Intermodal Transport Department revises all the changed articles, they will be issued to various railway bureaus for trial implementation. The record is on file. The revised text is that the freight rate for inter-railway transportation of materials is calculated at 9 cents per ton per kilometer. All car rental and late fees for inter-railway transportation of materials, track-crossing locomotives, and vehicles will be handled in accordance with the regulations stipulated in this chapter. For inter-railway damaged locomotives and vehicles, the freight will be collected at 4.5 cents per ton per kilometer based on the actual weight of the car body. It should be approved for implementation. In addition to separate orders, it is hereby ordered to comply with this order. This order has been forwarded by the bureau to the Car Department for compliance.</p>

<p>The memorial service for Mr. Lin Huanting, a pioneer of the party and the country, is scheduled to be held tomorrow at 10:00 AM in the auditorium of the Hubei Society on Guizhou Road, Beijing Road. The Central Government has specially sent Ye Chucang to Shanghai to offer sacrifices. The National Government has sent a telegram appointing Mayor Wu as its representative. A reporter from the Central News Agency learned from the preparatory office of Mr. Lin's memorial service yesterday that more than two or three thousand elegiac poems and eulogies have been sent from various parties. The following is a summary of the key points:</p>

<p>Collection of Tributes</p>
<p>(1) Chairman Lin of the National Government personally wrote the four characters "Loyalty and Integrity"; (2) Chairman Chiang wrote a memorial couplet, "One elder not spared, party history praises glory. Should erect a sheep stele facing the mountain, all sides are facing many difficulties, meritorious officials pass away, doubles the sorrow of the Lu Palace losing its spirit"; (3) Premier Wang wrote a eulogy, "Bao Pu has a saying, ice and frost are pure qualities of a clear person. Only you, sir, firmly uphold this virtue. What you have created for our party is equally important. Believe in the experience of old age in planning the country and always take the model of being close to the people. Why wither away in so much worry? It is appropriate to forever lament the people"; (4) Hu Hanmin wrote a poem, "It is difficult to know the Dao when writing history, suddenly surprised by the lightning, it is unbearable to see. Tears are shed for you in loneliness, the actions are ordinary, and it is safe to see. Ping Zhong is still good at socializing in the party, Jie Tui resigned from his position and had no official title. Surely the stomach and intestines are surrounded by Zhongshan, and the mausoleum is dry but the tears have not dried"; (5) Dai Jitao wrote a memorial couplet, "Half a lifetime of meritorious service to build the country, a thousand years of career to renew the people"; (6) Yu Youren wrote a memorial couplet, "He is the one who created the achievements of our party, from presiding over the sea defense to serving the mausoleum. Believing in the typical model of old age, shining and imperishable, taking the revolutionary predecessors as cultural mentors"; (7) Wu Zhihui wrote a memorial couplet, "Mentor of the people, pioneer of the party, the country mourns the meritorious, people mourn the old age"; (8) Sun Ke wrote a memorial couplet, "One heart, one mind, throughout the beginning and end, that is, you can work hard in your career and duty. Still in the spirit of heaven, the spirit is compatible, the same spirit and the same voice, without betraying the request. Suddenly, the obituary came from the Bund, wanting to ask if you are well, the wind and rain are ahead of autumn", and wrote a eulogy, "Great is Mr., our party's pioneer, profound knowledge and clear understanding, based on childhood, planning can help, donating wealth without stinginess, early affiliated to the Alliance, Fei Ying Meng Jin, late obeying the legacy, strict and careful, responsibility is not resigned, glory and profit are not competitive, the mausoleum is the process, the people's wisdom is used, deep silence and thunderous sound, good at socializing for a long time, reputation is high, all flows admire, the world is waiting to be governed, why is heaven unwilling, still thinking of his life, passionate and inspired, more than thirty years, dedicated to the revolution, the old model, the hero who saves the world, the deep waves of Yuehai, the high peaks of Wushan, the party history is long and fragrant, the moral heart asks"; (9) Feng Yuxiang wrote a memorial couplet, "Pointing to the granary to distribute gold and cherishing great virtue, autumn wind and river water send mourning thoughts"; (10) The Overseas Chinese Association in Vietnam wrote a memorial couplet, "The revolution has been hard, the success of building the country shines on the Han people, the philosopher sadly withers, and tears are shed in the Shenjiang to summon the soul".</p>

<p>Lin's Deeds</p>
<p>When we read Li Xing's epitaph for Yang Shu, the descriptions of his conduct and Taoist techniques have not been like those of my best friend, Mr. Huanting. The epitaph says that Duke Yang inherited the high style of bravery and integrity, had a good grasp of scale, and was kind and benevolent, just like Mr. Lin's early education at home, knowledge of the country's history, pain over the nation's demise, and following the lead of a mentor, joining the alliance in Yinghai, presiding over the alliance in Vietnam, vowing not to change, and not resting until success, and being upright in mind and gentle in manner, similar to him. The epitaph also says that his ideals and actions were outstanding and not ordinary, that he roamed in mystery and silence, promoted Taoism, and was knowledgeable in the arts, which is even more like Mr. Lin's inherent learning, love of righteousness, and respect for virtue. Mr. Lin connected talents at home and abroad, cultivated voice and strength, assisted the late Premier, gave advice, never changed, and never tired. After Zhennan, and after the establishment of the Republic of China, he never stopped working and never complained, and he never failed to help. It is said in the epitaph that he met the revolution and had a great style, held civil and military power to gather great power, which is indeed the case. However, Mr. Lin did not receive a rank or salary, and only modestly took it as his responsibility to promote party principles and culture, which is different from Shu Zi's career. The epitaph also says that he declined the reward of a great country, disarmed his troops, and declined credit and position, to be carefree in his original good intentions, which is similar to his original aspiration. What we know is that Mr. Lin's scriptures and latitude were precise, the transfer and reception were orderly, the equipment was prepared, and the benefits were transported. The plan was meticulous and never leaked. Since the founding of the country, he has still been in charge of the Department of Civil Affairs, not only not enriching himself, but also not living a comfortable life. He always took every penny to contribute to the overall situation. Looking at his life, his family was bare, with only a few shelves left to recognize Mr. Lin's life. He was exhausted by the party's affairs, not to mention having no time to calm his family, and even his life was never taken into account. He can smile and see the late Premier in the high sky of darkness. The inscription on the epitaph says, "Do without owning, ambition surpasses the clear sky," which is enough to recite for Mr. Lin. Colleagues are not resigned, only follow the shape on the right, the rest is fully biographical, not prepared to write.</p>

<h3 id="e141">After the Resolution of the Jardine Matheson Stevedore Strike, New Changes Arise: Company Accepts Terms...Compardores Firmly Refuse to Sign...Workers' Morale Surges...A Second Strike Imminent <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>The stevedores of various ships belonging to the British firm Jardine Matheson previously demanded a pay raise, which yielded no results for a long time. On the 21st of this month, they initiated a strike, simultaneously presenting three conditions. Following negotiations by the Preparatory Committee of the Chinese Seamen's Union, the company immediately agreed to accept the conditions. Work resumed the next day, as previously reported. It is now learned that although the company has accepted and acknowledged these terms, and instructed the compradors to handle the matter, the compradors, due to their own vested interests, have refused to sign. The workers are extremely indignant, and a second general strike is about to materialize. The situation is extremely dire. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e142">Company Accepts Three Conditions <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>On the 21st of this month, after the strike began, the Seamen's Union Preparatory Committee immediately negotiated with Jardine Matheson based on the three conditions proposed by the workers, and promptly invited the company's taipan (chief) to acknowledge them. Therefore, the Seamen's Union Preparatory Committee issued an emergency order that evening, instructing all workers to resume work. The workers unanimously obeyed the order and resumed work the next day. This was the situation at the time of the strike. However, the signing of the conditions was to be executed by the compradors, as the workers were directly employed by them, to comply with procedures. Therefore, the Preparatory Committee originally scheduled to co-sign with the compradors on the 25th of this month. However, the compradors, citing that the wages provided by the company were too low and insufficient to cover expenses, firmly refused to sign on the due date and requested the union to renegotiate and change the conditions. The already resolved labor dispute has thus experienced renewed turbulence.</p>
<h3 id="e143">Compradors Obstruct and Refuse to Sign Agreement <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>However, the Preparatory Committee holds a firm attitude, believing that the compradors' excuse is purely to maintain their own interests and harm the workers. Furthermore, the company has already indicated that the increased wages provided to the compradors are sufficient to accept the workers' conditions, making it clear that the compradors are deliberately obstructing. The committee then questioned the company again. To assume responsibility, the company's taipan, signed a letter to the Seamen's Union Preparatory Committee, stating, "Our company deeply appreciates your association's mediation in the recent dispute between our company's compradors and stevedores. Our company will certainly acknowledge and accept the following requirements (three conditions) and has informed each of our ship compradors to resolve them according to the above articles. Otherwise, please notify our company again."</p>
<h3 id="e144">Workers' Indignation: Another Strike Imminent <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>Upon receiving the above letter from the company, the Seamen's Union Preparatory Committee, in addition to informing the workers to work with peace of mind, continued to urge the compradors to proceed with the signing. However, the compradors consistently used the excuse of limited income and insufficient funds, hoping to shirk responsibility and achieve their goal of changing the conditions. Upon hearing the news, the workers were filled with indignation. Yesterday, they gathered at the union to request instructions, preparing for a second general strike to express their strong opposition and further urge the compradors to realize the situation. However, the union, considering that this matter is of great importance and to avoid escalating the turmoil, issued an emergency notice to the company and the shipping mutual aid association yesterday afternoon at 5:00 PM, hoping that they would come to the union to sign the agreement before 12:00 PM this morning to resolve the dispute. Otherwise, the compradors will be fully responsible for any incidents that occur.</p>
<h3 id="e145">The National Postal Workers' General Union's Statement on the Dismissal of a Postal Clerk in Hankou <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>The Hankou Postal Workers' Union has been established for over a year and has been registered with the Hankou Municipal Party Headquarters. Last month, the Hankou Postmaster provoked unrest by refusing to recognize the union. The National Postal Workers' General Union dispatched Lu Jingshi and Zhao Shusheng, and the Ministry of Communications sent Yu Senwen, Director of the Labor Affairs Committee, to mediate and establish seven solutions that were accepted by both parties. Recently, the Hankou Postmaster suddenly dismissed postal clerk Li Liqiang (the current executive member of the Hankou Postal Workers' Union), causing a serious labor dispute. According to responsible persons of the National Postal Workers' General Union yesterday, this incident was caused by the postmaster's illegal actions, which the union resolutely denies. They also showed drafts of telegrams sent to the Hankou Post Office and the Ministry of Communications, which are recorded below for public understanding. The telegram to the Hankou Post Office states: "To Postmaster Liu and Deputy Postmaster of the Hankou Postal Administration, we have investigated that your office punished postal clerk Li Liqiang under the pretext of borrowing the postal staff music team and subsequently dismissed him for disobeying transfer orders. Our association, based on the following reasons: (1) The music team was organized through fundraising by the staff and is not postal property. Therefore, its management is outside the scope of postal regulations. Li Liqiang borrowed the team as a staff member and a long-time member of the team, which is his right. Even if it does not comply with regulations, there is no responsibility in postal administration. Your office's dismissal and demotion based on the regulations is illegal. (2) Executive and supervisory committee members of the postal workers' union cannot be transferred during their term. This was one of the conditions agreed upon with your office in the presence of Mr. Yu Senwen, the special envoy of the Ministry of Communications, when resolving the Hankou postal labor dispute. Li Liqiang is the current executive member of the Hankou Postal Workers' Union. Your office's transfer violates the agreement and is suspected of obstructing union affairs. (3) Li Liqiang was unfairly punished, and your office did not allow him to state his reasons or take leave, even after repeated requests from the union. When Li Liqiang was sent to Shanghai to appeal based on the union's resolution, your office proceeded to dismiss him. Such suppression is procedurally flawed and unacceptable. Based on the above three points, the facts are clear. Our association believes that your office's actions are illegal, deprive employees of their interests, and hinder the progress of union affairs. This is an unfortunate development in the joint effort to save the postal service. Our association deeply regrets this. We deny the above illegal actions of your office and solemnly reserve the right to restore the legitimate rights of our workers that have been deprived. If any disputes arise as a result, your office will bear full responsibility. Sincerely, National Postal Workers' General Union." The message to the Ministry of Communications and the Postal Administration is similar and therefore omitted.</p>
<h3 id="e146">After the Dyeing Industry Stops Dyeing, Capitalists Ask the Silk Industry to Fulfill the Old Agreement; The Union Asks for Settlement of this Month's Liquor Allowance, Which is Not Agreed Upon <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>The silk and cotton dyeing workers have been refusing to dye customers' goods due to the dispute over liquor allowance, which has lasted for almost a week. The labor side requested that this month's liquor allowance be distributed first, and it was heard that a certain workshop had set up a new branch in Kunshan, which may lead to the smuggling of goods for dyeing. It was decided to send personnel to investigate and stop it this morning. Yesterday, the capitalists sent a letter to the Silk Industry Association, requesting that the dyeing fee be settled according to the old agreement, and also stipulated the size. They also replied to the labor side that the distribution of this month's liquor allowance would be postponed. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e147">Stop Private Dyeing <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>Since the silk and cotton dyeing workers refused to dye customers' goods, a panic occurred due to economic difficulties. They sent a letter to the capitalists requesting the payment of this month's liquor allowance to maintain their livelihood. It was also heard that a certain workshop had recently set up a branch workshop in Kunshan, and it was feared that the original goods of the customers would be shipped to Kunshan for dyeing. Therefore, it was decided to send representatives Shen Shuangxi, Shen Dayi, Tan Borong, Jin Aisheng, and others to investigate and take measures to stop it this morning.</p>
<h3 id="e148">Letter to the Silk Industry <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>The Dyeing Industry Business Improvement Association sent a letter to the Silk Industry Association yesterday, requesting the price to be given according to the original agreement and stipulating the size. The original letter said, "Dear Sirs, We have investigated that the silk and cotton dyeing workers of our dyeing industry have requested to separate the liquor allowance and restore the rights of the old agreement, resulting in a strike. Our association is planning measures to resume work as soon as possible. According to the reply from the silk and cotton dyeing office of the Labor Dyeing Industry Vocational Union, they stated that they will not resume work until the purpose of separating the liquor allowance and restoring the rights of the old agreement is achieved. The attitude is firm, and the situation is serious, with the potential for escalation. The cause of this strike is that many colleagues in your association have not fulfilled the dyeing price agreement signed by the Municipal Government Agriculture, Industry, and Commerce Bureau before 1927, and the unit price of various products of the new Ding Di Pi agreed in 1930. This has caused our industry to painfully cut dyeing prices, which is not enough to compensate for the cost of materials such as pigments, coal, tap water, and labor, resulting in huge losses. This has made it difficult to provide the liquor allowance included in the dyeing price, causing repercussions from the workers. Moreover, your colleagues are inconsistent in settling dyeing prices, resulting in uneven silk prices, disrupting the market, and causing the phenomenon of business decline. In addition, the dyeing price includes the liquor allowance, and there is no fundamental obstacle in the dyeing price agreement for deciding whether to mix or separate. The labor side has the benefit of autonomy. Your association should be clear about this meaning, and immediately separate the liquor allowance and amend the agreement to eliminate labor-capital disputes once and for all. If this strike is not resolved, our association will be torn apart between labor and capital, and the situation will force your industry into a vortex, and we will feel the impact together. Therefore, we request your association to adopt the following conditions and promptly convene a meeting of your colleagues to properly restore the dyeing price agreement of the former agreement and the promised prices of various new products newly ordered, and to earnestly settle the price and fulfill it. At the same time, discuss the provisions of silk feet slightly to maintain costs. If there is any consultation during the meeting, please provide the date of the meeting in advance so that we can send representatives to attend the meeting for consultation and seek a solution as soon as possible and resume work as soon as possible. We would be most grateful."</p>

<p>In addition, the same industry replied to the union letter, "Dear Sirs, We have received your letter of the 26th of this month, stating that all the workers of your office are in great need of daily expenses during this period, and we request that the liquor allowance be distributed before the 30th of this month, etc. We have approved this. We have investigated that many of our colleagues have not settled their dyeing accounts in the silk industry, and they have not paid for pigments, coal, and other goods. The current economic situation is extremely difficult. Moreover, with the occurrence of this strike, business has been suspended, and the source of economic income has been cut off. The factories have difficulty providing food, and there is a danger that even the cleverest housewives cannot cook. In this state, it is hoped that your workers will understand that the request to distribute the liquor allowance before the 30th of this month is both time-constrained and difficult. Our colleagues have the heart to cut meat to give to others, but they lack the strength. Labor and capital are in this kind of painful environment together and cannot fulfill the request. It is hoped that your office will inform the workers to deeply understand and temporarily suspend their demands. Sincerely."</p>

<p>China's customs service has always valued talent in its personnel administration, deeply believing that to improve customs affairs, it is essential to have individuals with extensive experience, outstanding abilities, and excellent knowledge to manage them effectively. Therefore, the government has always spared no effort in cultivating customs talent. In recent years, in view of the rapid progress of the world and the ever-changing customs policies of various countries, greater attention should be paid to observation to learn from others. Therefore, the General Commissioner of Customs has been instructed to select senior Chinese customs officers with excellent performance each year, undergo rigorous examinations, and send them to various European and American countries to inspect customs administration. So far, four batches of inspectors have returned to China. In 1929, Pan Xueyu and Li Pengshou were sent to the United States, and Wang Huamin and Jiang Chensheng were sent to the United Kingdom. In 1930, Fang Du and Zhou Bide were sent to France, and Wang Wenju and Zhong Dazhong were sent to Japan. In 1931, Shi Kun and Fan Hao were sent to Germany to inspect customs administration and anti-smuggling systems, and Zhuang Zezhong and Zhang Jiabao were sent to the United States to specialize in the country's anti-smuggling system. In 1932, Liu Qi and Yuan Fuchang were sent to the United Kingdom to specialize in the country's customs appraisal system, and Zuo Zhangjin and Li Baotian were sent to the United States to specialize in the country's customs appraisal system. The four individuals selected this year, Lu Bin and Liu Bingyi, will sail to the United States today on the McKinley. Mr. Lu will inspect the customs and anti-smuggling systems of the United States and Canada, and Mr. Liu will inspect the United States customs statistics system. Xia Tingyao and Ye Yuanzhang will also depart for Europe within days. Mr. Xia will inspect the customs and anti-smuggling systems of the United Kingdom and Germany, and Mr. Ye will inspect the customs statistics system of France. It is said that the four individuals leaving this time are all deeply respected and have been serving in the customs service for nearly 20 years, holding key positions as deputy commissioners in various customs offices. The government and customs authorities have high expectations for this overseas trip, and it is believed that they will return home with honor in the future and make a contribution to China's customs administration. It is also heard that each customs inspector must prepare a report on their findings every three months and submit it to the General Commissioner of Customs, who will then forward it to the Customs Administration of the Ministry of Finance for review. Therefore, each member sent in the past has been able to work diligently and conscientiously while abroad, conducting on-site inspections, and their work has been very demanding. Their achievements have long been praised by domestic and foreign authorities, and they have been able to live up to the government's expectations.</p>

<h3 id="e153">The Liquor Industry Federation Asks for Exemption from Registration for Door-to-Door Sales of Local Liquor, and Exemption from Tax Refund and Supplementary Tax Procedures to Stabilize Business <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai-Nanjing-Suzhou Liquor Industry Association Federation telegraphed the Taxation Department of the Ministry of Finance and the Jiangsu Stamp Tax and Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Bureau yesterday, stating: "We have recently received a document from Chen Xikang, Han Xingwei, Cen Guangqing, and others, the standing committee members of the Shanghai Soy Sauce and Liquor Industry Association, stating that we have heard rumors that merchants' liquor stocks will be inspected in the coming days, and that registration and tax refund and supplementary tax procedures will be required. Although the authorities have not formally notified our association, most of our members have come to the association to inquire about the truth and stated that inspection, registration, and tax refund and supplementary tax procedures are not necessary for door-to-door sales stores. We have excerpted several reasons below: (1) Local liquor merchants can actually be renamed local liquor door-to-door sales merchants. Because no matter what kind of local liquor, once it enters the liquor and soy sauce stores, it must be opened, mixed, and sold retail. Although there may be sales in the original tank, it is only about one or two out of a thousand, which is the same as the nature of a tobacco shop. It is not dedicated to selling the original tank of local liquor. One should pay attention to this. (2) Soy sauce and liquor stores are engaged in door-to-door sales, so their inventory is naturally limited. There are more than 3,000 soy sauce stores in Shanghai, and the stores are of different sizes. Some stores have only four or five tanks in stock, or ten or more tanks, and at most less than a hundred tanks. If registration is required, the procedures will not only be cumbersome, but the quantity will also be difficult to accurately determine. Because they sell daily and the goods enter and exit irregularly, it depends on the prosperity or decline of the door-to-door sales business. Would it not be unnecessarily troublesome and add nothing to the facts? One should pay attention to this. (3) Tax refunds and supplementary taxes. If these procedures are handled for soy sauce and liquor stores, it will inevitably cause major disputes. Because tax refunds must match the receipt, but soy sauce and liquor stores only have a stamped receipt and no joint slip during the public sales era. In addition, if the white liquor is unloaded, there is no receipt at all. In fact, no tax is evaded. If they are ordered to pay, how can merchants willingly comply? Moreover, the same taxpayer and the same government office, the facts are all there, which can be investigated. How can merchants be forced to suffer this huge loss? If the past is traced, the government office that handled the public sales should share the responsibility, so that justice can be served. Otherwise, soy sauce and liquor merchants will vow not to admit it. One should pay attention to this. (4) The government's method is to eliminate corruption and return every drop of profit to the public. Legitimate merchants who comply with regulations and pay taxes should be given sympathy and not be harassed, so as to stabilize business and cultivate tax sources. Now, the branch bureau measures and affixes stamps, and a special bureau is set up along the way to check and prevent fraud. Is this not thorough enough? Why must the inventory be inspected at door-to-door sales stores? This will only cause merchants to suffer endless harassment. Moreover, Shanghai is a special situation. Will the concessions be inspected at the same time? Where is the so-called fairness? One should pay attention to this. In summary, the situation is very urgent. Therefore, we earnestly present the above and hope that you will forward it to the Taxation Department and the provincial bureau for prompt approval regarding soy sauce and liquor merchants' door-to-door sales of local liquor, and exemption from registration and tax refund and supplementary tax procedures to stabilize business." Upon receipt of this document, in addition to sending a separate telegram, we are sending this express mail for your approval and instructions, so that you can inform us for public convenience. Zhang Dalian, Chairman of the Shanghai-Nanjing-Suzhou Liquor Industry Association Federation.</p>

<p>Valley Lyon, Harbor Master of the Jianghai Customs, issued Notice No. 18 yesterday for the periodic dredging of the Huangpu River, stating: "Sections 7, 8, and 9 of the Huangpu River now need to be dredged. This project is scheduled to begin on the 26th of this month and will continue until a separate notice is issued to suspend work. It will be carried out in two steps, first on the south side of the above locations, or in the Pudong waterway. During the project, the waterway where the dredgers are moored will be closed to traffic day and night. As for the construction procedure, the buoys Nos. 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11 will be removed first. Once the removal is completed, the south waterway will be closed and work will begin. When the project there is completed, the buoys Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 will be removed, and all ships will travel on the south waterway, while the north waterway will be closed to navigation and dredging will begin. All shipping companies should pay special attention to the position of the dredgers (two or more) and the anchors thrown out into the navigable waterway. The dredging work is only within the closed waterway and has clear anchor position markers. All ships should be extremely cautious when approaching the berths on the closed waterway, especially the sides where the dredgers are working properly. Diagrams of this project can be obtained from this department, the Pilotage Association, or the Engineering Office of the Huangpu River Dredging Bureau. All shipping companies are hereby notified."</p>

<p>The Japanese-owned Huafeng Yarn Factory in Wusong Yuncaobang West, which suspended operations before the Battle of Shanghai, moved all the remaining goods, foreign yarn, important items, and even waste cotton stored in the factory to the Shanghai Rihua Yarn Factory for storage. Although the war ended later, the factory has not yet started work. Until yesterday, a recruitment notice was suddenly posted at the back gate of the factory, stating that the factory will open on November 6 (Monday), and from today onwards, male and female workers will be recruited. Many unemployed male and female workers came to sign up, but very few were accepted. It is said that General Manager Takayama (Japanese) is now planning to change his approach. Although the factory is scheduled to open on Monday, only a small part of the machines will be started, and then they will be added gradually, with a period of three months for all the machines to be started, so that male and female excellent workers can be selected gradually.</p>

<p>It was previously reported that Gu Dingji, an employee of the Shanghai Bank, was missing. It has now been heard that he was found in the hospital the day before yesterday. He has now recovered from his illness and can be discharged from the hospital today. It turned out that he suddenly fell ill on the way to the factory on the 16th and was admitted to the hospital for treatment. He entrusted someone to make a phone call to report to the bank. Later, he was unconscious for several days and could not write a letter. Unexpectedly, the bank did not receive the phone call, so it was mistakenly reported as missing. When he saw the report in the newspaper, he immediately notified the bank again, and the truth was revealed.</p>
<h3 id="e159">Zhao Hanqing Will Re-Enter Prison to Serve Out His Unexpired Sentence <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>Zhao Hanqing, a native of Xiaoshan County, Zhejiang Province, once belonged to the political circles and served in the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau. In December of the year before last, he was found by the military police to be privately selling opium raw opium in Zhejiang Province. After being sent to the court for investigation, Zhao was found to be a well-known opium merchant. The Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway and the Qiantang River land and water transportation were often frequented by him. Not only did he undermine the opium prohibition in Zhejiang Province, but he also belonged to those who were not afraid of the law. He should be severely punished and sentenced to ten years of imprisonment and sent to prison. When he was imprisoned until May of last year, Zhao begged for bail on the grounds that he was not used to prison life. The court approved the request and ordered a joint guarantee of 8,000 yuan in cash. Therefore, Zhao Jiyun, Zhao's brother, asked Zhang Boliang, a compradore of the Alice Foreign Company at 261 Sichuan Road in Shanghai and a native of Hangzhou, to write a joint guarantee, and he was bailed out. It has been a year and a half since then. However, Zhao Hanqing has since remained at large, and he has not thought about restraining himself from the unexpired sentence. Recently, the Zhejiang Provincial High Court found that both guarantors were at sea, so it sent a letter to the Shanghai First Special District Local Court to assist in bringing the guarantors to justice and strictly ordering them to hand over Zhao for investigation. The two guarantors knew it was difficult to shirk their responsibility, so they truthfully revealed the whereabouts of Zhao, and the court issued an arrest warrant and sent it to the French Concession, together with the French police, to rush to No. 20, Lane 280, Longpo Race Road, to arrest Zhao Hanqing and bring him to court for violating the arrest warrant. The responsibility of the two guarantors was then released. Yesterday morning, Judge Wu Tingqi of the First Special Court interrogated him. Wang Yaotang, the lawyer of the police station, stated that the Public Works Bureau had no objection to the transfer of the Zhejiang Provincial Court, and Zhao also wanted to make a statement. Judge Wu then ordered that this was an assistance case and the court would not conduct an inquiry, and immediately ruled that Zhao Hanqing would be detained and await a letter requesting the Zhejiang Provincial High Court to send personnel to take him.</p>

<p>According to the Guidance Office of the International Trade Bureau yesterday, China has suffered frequent floods and droughts in recent years, the rural economy has collapsed, and the people's food and farming have become increasingly desolate. The rice production is not enough to meet the demand and relies entirely on large-scale imports of Siamese rice for supply. The statistics for the recent seven years are listed below, and the numbers are quite alarming.</p>
<p>1927: 10,425,818 dan</p>
<p>1928: 8,672,322 dan</p>
<p>1929: 4,750,812 dan</p>
<p>1930: 5,037,201 dan</p>
<p>1931: 8,020,774 dan</p>
<p>1932: 6,437,428 dan</p>
<p>1933 (until September): 6,166,952 dan</p>
<p>Observing the above table, the quantity of Siamese rice imported into China in the past seven years was the largest in 1927. As of September this year, the number has already exceeded 6 million dan. Compared with 1927, the total is expected to be no less than that year.</p>

<p>Lu Ying, Captain of the City Public Security Bureau Detective Team, dispatched detectives Fang Lin'gen, Zhang Kun, Shi Chunlin, Cheng Peizhang, Gu Rusheng, and others, along with district police officers, to conduct inspections of pedestrians in the vicinity of Fangxie Road and Diandang Lane in Nanshi. They noticed a man loitering in the area, whom they suspected of being a troublemaker. The detectives approached him for questioning. The man claimed to be "Zhao Niaochuan from Nantong, intending to visit his friend Lu Linyi at No. 2 Diandang Lane." They knocked on the door, brought the man inside for questioning, but found many inconsistencies in their accounts. Both men appeared anxious and uneasy. In the kitchen, under a floorboard in Lu's bedroom, and inside an empty box, they discovered a total of eleven tins of red pills. Zhao Niaochuan (age 32) and Lu Linyi (age 21) were taken into custody along with the drugs. Zhao confessed to purchasing red pills from Lu, and Lu admitted to running a red pill distribution network. The district authorities, considering the case to involve the sale of narcotics in violation of prohibitions, ordered the two suspects, Zhao and Lu, along with the evidence, to be sent to the General Bureau for further investigation according to the law.</p>

<p>Mr. Tai Kuan, a trainer of seals at the Haijingbo Circus and a key figure in the troupe, is currently receiving medical treatment after being attacked by a well-trained seal. His right arm is covered in deep tooth marks, reaching the bone, causing him considerable pain. He is being treated by Dr. Lai Nan. However, he is still able to perform on schedule. The incident occurred the night before last after a performance, when Mr. Tai Kuan led the seal to the arena for practice. After the practice, one of the animals began to bark loudly, refusing to leave the arena. Mr. Tai Kuan insisted on its departure, taking a firm stance. Suddenly, the animal attacked, biting his right arm. Fortunately, he was able to fight it off and seek medical attention. According to the troupe's manager, Mr. Shi Huit, starting from Wednesday, November 1st, they will be introducing an entirely new program with elements rarely seen in ordinary circuses, including an aerial performance where the entire cast dances at the top of the stage. Additionally, a Chinese acrobatic troupe will be joining, allowing the audience to compare Chinese and Western acrobatic arts. In these sixteen new acts, Mr. Masiss's fourteen Bengal tigers will feature renewed routines with more technical performances. The entire clown troupe will be particularly focused, preparing many local-themed gags to appeal to both Chinese and foreign audiences.</p>
<h3 id="e163">Lack of Funds Hinders Progress of Industrial Materials Testing Laboratory <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese Engineering Society, recognizing the gradual development of industry and commerce in our country and the lack of an industrial materials testing institution, initiated the organization of an Industrial Materials Testing Laboratory in 1924 to support the progress of industry and commerce. After years of preparation, some progress has been made, but due to financial constraints, it has not been possible to achieve completion soon. The Society hopes that enthusiastic individuals from all walks of life will provide substantial assistance to facilitate its early establishment. The Society's recent news is detailed below:</p>
<p>Fundraising: Since the establishment of the Industrial Materials Testing Class, people from all walks of life have enthusiastically donated funds. As of August 20, 1929, a total of over 17,147 yuan has been received. Although this is far from the projected fundraising goal, it has been temporarily suspended due to various reasons. However, to expedite its completion, it still relies on the substantial assistance of people from all walks of life.</p>
<p>Allocation of Funds: The operating expenses of the laboratory, excluding the already purchased land, are tentatively set at 150,000 yuan, with 30,000 yuan for constructing the laboratory building and 120,000 yuan for purchasing various instruments used for testing. Currently, apart from the funds already raised, along with donated materials, totaling approximately 40,000 yuan, there is a shortfall of about 110,000 yuan, which needs to be raised continuously.</p>
<p>Future Work: The future work plan of the laboratory is tentatively divided into two areas: (1) systematically collect and research domestic industrial raw materials; (2) conduct tests on various manufactured products or materials for institutions and manufacturers. Institutions or manufacturers that provide substantial support to the laboratory may, within a certain scope, enter into long-term contracts for long-term testing and various research projects.</p>
<p>Testing and Research: The laboratory's planned testing and research scope covers both mechanical and chemical departments. Upon sufficient funding in the future, electrical, physical, and other departments will be added, and the existing departments will be expanded.</p>

<p>Recently, certain individuals from Wuxi, in collusion with Japanese national Qing Yicilang, established the Dayuan Company in Yangjiadu, Nanshi. They purchased a Japanese ship, the "Hong Kong Maru," renamed it the "Dachang Wheel," intending to operate on the Shenchong Haiqi and other routes. Individuals Wang and Shen, believing that the company, though managed by Chinese, is actually capitalized by Japanese and seeks to seize inland navigation rights by using a Chinese front, have jointly reported this to the Ministry of Communications and other agencies, requesting a stop to it. We have excerpted and submitted the document to the Ministry as follows: Submitted to the Ministry: Acting as a Japanese accomplice, harming navigation rights, requesting the dispatch of personnel for thorough investigation and requesting the court to detain and prosecute the case. It has been learned that certain individuals, originally from Wuxi and residing in Shanghai, failed in business and were in dire straits. Recently, they suddenly had a whimsical idea and, with Japanese national Qing Yicilang, organized the Dayuan Company in Yangjiadu, with a certain individual acting as the front. They purchased the Japanese Qing Company's "Hong Kong Maru," slightly repainted it, and renamed it the "Dachang Wheel," vaguely applying to the Ministry of Communications Navigation Bureau for registration to operate on the Shenchong Haiqi route. This is about to be carried out, with the maiden voyage imminent. Qing Biao and others, witnessing the madness of certain individuals acting as accomplices to the tiger, cannot help but think that the Japanese national has ulterior motives. Feeling endangered, they cannot remain silent. Therefore, they specifically submit this document detailing the circumstances of the organization of the Dayuan Company by certain individuals and the Japanese national, requesting review and approval to dispatch personnel for thorough investigation, and requesting detention and prosecution.</p>

<p>A group of thirteen Buddhist pilgrims from countries including France, Germany, Italy, and Belgium, including Bhikkhu Apollo, Sitibuddha, Ubaro, Anubangkajika, Patilafa, Ufaba, Sasipu, and Darubi, arrived in Shanghai on July 25th. They immediately went to the residence of their teacher, Zhao Kong, on Daxi Road to study Buddhist rituals and the general principles of various scriptures. According to information gathered by a reporter from Heping News, the thirteen, led by their teacher Zhao Kong, decided to go to Qixia Temple on Qixia Mountain in Nanjing on the first day of next month to receive full ordination from Master Ruoshun. In addition to providing a letter of introduction, the Chinese Buddhist Association of this city has specially assigned a student studying in Germany, Mr. Qin, to accompany them to act as an interpreter. On the day of departure, Wang Yiting, Huang Hanzhi, Guan Jiongzhi, and others personally went to the North Station to see them off.</p>

<p>Zhao Pinhou and Zhao Guoting, prominent dye merchants, reside at Nos. 2 to 4 Maigen Road, Kangnaotuo Road, West Shanghai. The residence is elaborately decorated, with pavilions, terraces, and scenic gardens. Recently, the Zhao family has been involved in a inheritance lawsuit, which has been adjudicated by the court. Surprisingly, yesterday morning around 9:30, a large bomb was suddenly discovered at the gate of the residence. Fortunately, before it could explode, it was noticed by the gateman, who quickly filled a water container and submerged the bomb to prevent the explosive power from detonating. He immediately reported it to the police station, who dispatched detectives to investigate and report back to the station. The meaning of this bomb remains unclear. It is rumored that the Zhao family has commercial dealings with a certain foreign national, and it is feared that it may be the work of a patriotic organization. This is noted for future observation.</p>

<p>Our country's match industry is still in its infancy. Since the dumping of foreign matches, business has been even more dismal. According to news from the local match industry, the majority of foreign match factories in China are established by Japanese merchants, with six factories including Suisheng. Japanese matches are sold in all provinces of the country, significantly impacting the domestic match industry. This month, another large shipment of Japanese matches, weighing 800 tons, was shipped from Kobe, Japan, to Shanghai, actively attempting to dump them.

<p>The Ningbo Old Jiang Bridge Fundraising Office held a preparatory meeting yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM at the Ningbo Shanghai Fellow Association on Xizang Road. Attendees included Yu Qiaqing, Qin Runqing, Xu Maotang, Yu Zuoting, Sun Hengfu, Qin Shanbao, Le Zhenbao, Zhang Jiguang, Jin Tingsun, Yu Baosan, Wang Gaosun, Jiang Bingsheng, Zhang Shenzhi, and over twenty others. Yu Qiaqing, as chairman, reported that preparations for the construction of the Ningbo Old Jiang Bridge had been underway for a long time, and the raised funds had reached a significant amount. The blueprints for the new bridge, drawn by American engineers, have been reviewed and completed. He urged continued efforts to raise 700,000 yuan in a short period to commence construction. Zhang Jiguang reported on the progress of fundraising, with a total of over 500,000 yuan raised. A reporter from Heping News learned that there was only one donation ledger, with a gold-lettered cover that was quite beautiful. The minimum donation amount in the ledger was 50 yuan, setting a new record for donation ledgers. Over 500,000 yuan has been fully collected, with the largest donation being 50,000 yuan donated solely by Xu Qingyun's son, Maotang. The main points of discussion were that construction would only commence after 700,000 yuan was raised. The new bridge will be constructed entirely of steel and concrete, and will be a drawbridge, allowing ships to pass through. The construction site will be located from Houtang Street in Jiangdong to Banbian Street in the west, which differs from the original bridge site.</p>
<h3 id="e169">Famous Work on Chrysanthemums <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>The history of chrysanthemums in China is very long. Since ancient times, there have been hundreds of works on chrysanthemums, focusing on artistic depictions, but generally simplifying cultivation methods and seed selection. As a result, old varieties gradually degenerate, and new varieties are rare. In recent years, chrysanthemum enthusiasts in various provinces have spent exorbitant amounts of money purchasing new varieties. The huge sums spent are truly astonishing. Huang Junshu's book, "Chrysanthemum Mirror," is based on practical experience. Its rich content and detailed records mark a new era for the chrysanthemum-growing community.

<p>Cai Yuchao (also known as Hexiao), the owner of Cai Tongde Drugstore, has a beloved daughter named Jufen, who is three years old. On the morning of the 19th of this month, at 10:00 AM, she was taken out shopping by the young servant Xie Baogen, but neither returned. Despite extensive searching, there was no sign of them. After several days, Cai suddenly received a threatening letter signed Xiaoshandong, stating that the child was being held by them and that 35,000 yuan was required for her release. He subsequently received four more similar letters. Cai realized his beloved daughter had been kidnapped and reported it to the Xinzha Police Station. Head Constable Zhao Hehai and Cui Chengke were dispatched to Cai's residence at No. 11, Lane 698, Baike Road, to await news. It so happened that Cai's nephew, Cai Tongqiu, who lives at No. 2 Qiu'an Lane, Changan Road, Zhabei, and is currently unemployed, visited his uncle every day after Cai's daughter went missing to offer condolences. On the 21st, Cai Tongqiu volunteered to contact the kidnappers. The two detectives, seeing his suspicious behavior, detained him and found two notes on him. The handwriting was identical to that of the ransom letters. They were immediately taken to the police station, and Cai Jufen and Xie Baogen were found at his home, along with Cai's wife, Shao. All were taken to the police station and handed over to the First Special Court for interrogation and detention. As reported in this newspaper, yesterday morning, Judge Wu Tingqi of the First Special Court continued the trial in the Eighth Criminal Court. Cai Yuchao hired Attorney Gu Gongbing to represent him, and Cai Tongqiu hired Attorney Jiang Baoli for his defense. Police Attorney Wang Yaotang stated that after the case was adjourned, the police handwriting expert Mei Yu identified that the note on the defendant matched the handwriting in the threatening letter. When questioned, Cai Tongqiu confessed that he wrote the five letters and claimed that he initially had no such evil intentions but was overcome by a sudden bad thought and fell into the trap of the law, begging for leniency. Cai Shao denied pre-planning with her husband. The court, seeing that the facts were clear, ordered the commencement of arguments. Police Attorney Wang stated that the defendant did not engage in kidnapping at the time of the crime but only in enticement, and then wrote a letter demanding ransom. Therefore, he had committed the crime of enticement under Article 257 of the Criminal Code and the crime of extortion under Article 370 of the Criminal Code. According to the Criminal Procedure Law, he should be punished for the more serious crime. Attorney Jiang Baoli defended the defendant, stating that the defendant's actions were the result of economic pressure caused by the plaintiff. The plaintiff, owning hundreds of thousands of dollars, not only did not find a suitable job for his unemployed nephew, but even when the defendant borrowed money from the plaintiff, it was only three or five yuan. Therefore, he asked the court to consider the circumstances and give a warning and lenient punishment. Judge Wu then declared the arguments concluded and set the sentencing for October 30.</p>

<h3 id="e176">Ningbo Fellow Association Writes to Jianghai Customs Yesterday to Exempt Fish Tax, Fresh Fish Industry Sends Representatives to Seek Assistance <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>After the Jianghai Customs in this city detained fresh fish shipped from Ningbo to Shanghai, demanding tax payment, representatives of the fresh fish industry, Shen Xianlu and Shen Daqing, went to the Ningbo Shanghai Fellow Association to seek assistance. After receiving the letter, the Association wrote to Tang Haian, the superintendent of Jianghai Customs, requesting the prompt release of the detained fresh fish and exemption from tax as per previous practice. A reporter from Heping News has excerpted the original letter as follows: Respected Sir, We recently received a letter from the Ningbo Fresh Fish Industry Association, stating that the industry transports fresh fish between Shanghai and Ningbo to adjust the supply and demand in both places and circulate domestic goods. Ships are loaded daily and rushed to the dawn fish market. Any obstruction will cause the fresh fish to rot. Therefore, customs declaration has been avoided in the past to save procedures. Since the Qing Dynasty Guangxu and Xuantong years, for decades, all Customs Superintendents and Tax Commissioners have known the special difficulties of transporting and selling fresh goods and have been kind, not wanting to impose harsh laws. On the fourth day of this month, Jianghai Customs detained our industry's fresh fish, causing a great impact on our industry. The following is a brief summary of the events: (1) Due to limited resources, fishing boats operating along the coast are old-fashioned sailing ships. With no machines, they rely entirely on wind power. When the south wind blows, they sail to Shanghai; when the west wind blows, they sail to Ningbo. The boats gather together with the wind, so the need for fresh fish in both places is often excessive or insufficient. Too much will easily rot and become waste, and the national nutrition will be lacking. Our industry adjusts the quantity, loading from Ningbo to Shanghai or from Shanghai to Ningbo, circulating domestic goods so that the people always have fresh fish for nutrition. (2) The fish tax has already been exempted. In February of the twentieth year, the National Government issued a general order to exempt all fish and fishing taxes. In the future, no matter what kind of organization, it may not establish new items and collect this tax, in order to comply with the government's intention to eliminate cumbersome procedures and protect the fishing industry. (3) Fishermen risk their lives at sea, mostly Ningbo people from Zhejiang. They rely entirely on the fish market to maintain their livelihoods. The Ningbo Customs is familiar with the local situation, so it has long understood the difficulties of fresh fish transportation. It has not collected this fishing tax to date. (4) Fresh fish is a very perishable item, and its selling time is limited to the moment just before dawn. If this moment is delayed, no one will bother with it, and it will be regarded as waste. Therefore, when the ship docks, these fresh fish must be quickly transported to the fish market. If customs declaration and inspection are required, all procedures are more complicated, and the customs personnel are numerous and may not fully understand the difficult situation. Any delay will affect the future of the fishing industry. (5) Slightly omitted, requesting clarification and transfer to the authorities that when ships transport fresh fish barrels at the Shanghai and Ningbo wharves, the old practice of not adding any additional fees should still be followed. It is learned that Ningbo Fresh Fish Industry representatives Shen Xianlu and Xin Lianqing also visited the Jianghai Customs Superintendent yesterday with a letter of introduction from the Ningbo Fellow Association, stating the difficulties in person.</p>
<h3 id="e177">Qian Yizhang Buried Yesterday <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>Qian Yizhang (alias Huang Yonghua), former Standing Committee Member of the Special Committee of the Chinese Seamen's Special Party and former Director of the Special Affairs Section of the Shanghai Public Security Bureau, was targeted by the Communists for his work in special affairs. On the evening of August 25th, he was suddenly shot and killed by thugs as he left the Xinxin Hotel. As previously reported in this newspaper, in addition to jointly pursuing the murderers, the city's agencies had Qian's body transported by his family to the China Funeral Home for coffin preparation. The burial was held yesterday. The funeral was prepared in advance by the funeral committee, so many people from all walks of life went to pay their respects. At 10:00 AM, the procession left the China Funeral Home and was buried in the Yong'an Cemetery on Overseas Chinese Road. Armed police officers from the Municipal Public Security Bureau escorted the procession along the way. Plain cars and white horses were prepared with the utmost sorrow. However, Qian's life after death was bleak, so the family plans to request preferential treatment.</p>

<p>The commercial properties in Yuqing Lane, located west of Baliqiao Road on Avenue Edward VII in the French Concession, are owned by Zhou Lianji and managed by accountant Jiang Wanping. This spring, due to the economic downturn and sluggish business along the Avenue Edward VII, the shop tenants gathered to negotiate a reduction in rent. They appointed representatives including Yao Zhaoji of Chungiang Hotel, Jin Hongdong of Guohua Electric Company, Hong Yongyu of Brothers Socks Factory, Zhang Huiqiao of Meifeng Silk Store, Shen Yongkang of Yongkang Sauce Garden, Jiang Maotang of Ruyi Restaurant, and Wang Yongkang of Xie Kangcheng, totaling nine people, to send letters to the landlord and the management, requesting consideration of the difficult economic situation and a reduction of the rent. These representatives personally went to the landlord to petition and negotiate back and forth. The landlord has now accepted the conditions and instructed the representatives to negotiate with accountant Jiang. The following terms have been agreed upon: (1) the original rent will be reduced by 10%; (2) the reduction will take effect from July of this year; (3) the rent reduction period will be two years, after which the rent may be increased if the economy recovers. The representatives convened all tenants yesterday to report on the negotiation process. All tenants approved the agreement and resolved to abide by the above conditions. The representatives will send letters of thanks to the landlord and accountant Jiang, and request a letter to the French Municipal Council to amend the property tax receipts.</p>
<h3 id="e179">The Family Industrial Society Establishes a Children's Dental Hospital <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>During the Children's Memorial Day in April of this year, the Municipal Education Bureau, Public Security Bureau, and Health Bureau jointly organized the Municipal Children's Welfare Committee to establish ordinary and labor nurseries and to formulate all measures for the "Children's Year." Their work is currently underway. The Family Industrial Society has always paid close attention to social welfare. Recognizing the importance of children's dental health, and the fact that Chinese people generally neglect children's dental care, almost 99 out of 100 children have completely decayed teeth. Poor dental health means food cannot be properly chewed and digested, leading to nutritional deficiencies and weakened bodies, posing a great threat to the nation's future generations. The reason for this is that dental equipment is expensive, making dental fees higher than other medical costs. Children often have a dozen or twenty decayed teeth, and the cost of repairing them, even at a minimum of 100 yuan per person, is a burden that many families cannot afford, forcing them to neglect their children's dental health. Since its inception, the Family Industrial Society has aimed to defeat Japanese "King Kong Lion" toothpaste with its "Invincible" brand face powder, which has disappeared from the market. Later, it introduced "Pure White" toothpaste to compete with imported brands, demonstrating its deep commitment to dental health. Therefore, it has resolutely decided to sacrifice a large sum to establish a children's dental hospital. All surgical machinery is designed and manufactured by the Family Industrial Society itself, adhering to the principle of using purely domestic products. The designs were created jointly by Chen Xiaodie and Li Xinfu of the society, with guidance from the Health Bureau, led by dental doctor Su Jielang. Dr. Su, with his extensive knowledge and experience in dentistry, has generously sacrificed personal gain to help the Family Industrial Society carry out its work and serve the community. The hospital will charge each child a fee of two jiao, concerned that offering completely free services might deter those in the upper class from seeking treatment.</p>

<h3 id="e184">Unreasonable Questions from Shantou Citizens Rejecting the Levy of Tax on Foreign Rice Ignored by the National Federation of Commerce <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>According to Shiye News Agency, the National Federation of Commerce, recognizing that low grain prices harm farmers and cause widespread poverty, telegraphed the Executive Yuan, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Finance, and Ministry of Industry of the National Government in July, requesting that import taxes on foreign rice be levied as soon as possible to alleviate people's hardship and safeguard the nation's foundation. The Ministry of Industry replied that the tax levy was temporarily suspended due to Guangdong Province's dissenting opinion. The Federation telegraphed the Guangdong Provincial Government again in early September, requesting its joint support. Provinces such as Anhui, Hunan, Henan, and Hubei, considering the levy of foreign rice tax as an urgent task for rural relief, also unanimously supported and responded. The central government is currently drafting tax regulations and has decided to implement them on New Year's Day next year. It is reported that since the implementation of tax levies in provinces such as Guangdong and Fujian, rice prices have been declining daily. Old rice in rice-producing areas such as Anhui, Hunan, and Guangxi is also being sold, indicating that our country does not lack rice. The levy of tax on foreign rice is an effective measure to protect domestic rice. However, the Federation received a letter yesterday from Chen Jingchu and others of the Shantou Citizens' Association, opposing the levy of foreign rice tax and raising five questions requesting answers. The Federation considers these questions absurd and unworthy of a response and plans to ignore them.</p>

<p>▲Novel Advertising Invention: The success of a business relies heavily on advertising. Well-designed advertising is both effective and fast. Recently, Mr. Lin Anshou has carefully researched a unique form of advertising never before seen: advertising inside rental cars. This has been praised by both Chinese and foreign authorities. The plans are ingenious, original, elegant, and beautiful. They are clear during the day and can be transparent and luminous at night, attracting attention. Many major merchants in Shanghai have contacted him to place advertisements, reaching over a hundred vehicles. He has agreements with Xiang Sheng, Lili, Yellow, and other major car companies, granting him exclusive installation rights. The office is located at No. 20 Museum Road and is called the Public Car Advertising Company.</p>
<p>▲Baofang Company Offers Low-Priced Gifts: Since the launch of Baofang Company's annual big sale and gift promotion at its Dongxinqiao and No. 4 Road Henan Road branches, the stores have been very crowded with customers.

For example, buying a phonograph gets you six Gaoting records as a gift. Buying three records gets you a box of Gaoting needles as a gift. Buying other goods for over three yuan gets you a bottle of the company's specially made record and machine oil. This annual low-price gift promotion is a great opportunity for everyone to purchase phonographs and records.</p>

<p>▲Dalu Factory Invents Embroidered Glue: Recently, Shanghai Dalu Chemical Factory has invented a new "Victory" brand embroidery glue, available in dozens of colors. The quality surpasses imported products, and the price is low. This glue can be used for embroidery painting instead of embroidery, but it is superior in every way. It not only saves money and labor, but also looks more stylish and beautiful. Although embroidery is a superb Chinese craft, it has lost its appeal in the trend. Therefore, modern people mostly use painted embroidery instead. However, most of the raw materials used are purchased from overseas. Therefore, this factory spared no effort and painstakingly researched, succeeding after hundreds of chemical experiments. It is now distributed by Dahua Trading Company, located at 617 on the 6th floor of Dalu Mall on Nanjing Road. The company has hired a specialist to provide free instruction in the secrets of embroidery painting, and is also recruiting managers for other locations to expand operations. It is said that this glue can be applied to any silk fabric, as well as porcelain, copper, jade, and all kinds of utensils. The colors are bright, the adhesion is strong, and the colors never fade.</p>

<p>To the Editor,</p>
<p>I am writing on behalf of Mr. Rongchangxiang, who claims that your newspaper published an article on the 26th with the headline "Drug Case Involving Zhang Wanrong, Zhang Claims Real Name is Wanrong, Used Zhang Surname to Exchange Certificate, Court Still Needs to Investigate." This is not true. My client's business owner is Wanrong, not Zhang Wanrong. The case is currently under investigation by the police and has not been prosecuted. The truth will soon be revealed. Therefore, I have been instructed by my client to request that your newspaper correct the record to clarify the matter. I hope that your newspaper will publish this letter in the "Letters to the Editor" section.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>To the Editor,</p>
<p>I am writing regarding the news article "Development of Zhonghua Xinyin Dyeing Due to Workers' Strikes in the Dyeing Industry" published in your newspaper's local news section today (October 27th). There is a slight inaccuracy. The sentence "all merchant gangs have switched to Huaxin Company" should be followed by "producing Huajin fabric." We are afraid this will cause misunderstandings, so we are writing to request that you publish this letter.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

<h3 id="e202">A Letter Regarding Education in Jiangyin <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>A certain gentleman in the education field, yesterday sent a letter from Chengjiang to a member of the editorial department of this newspaper, detailing the state of education in Jiangyin in recent years, which was quite incisive. We are now publishing it for the attention of those responsible for improving education. The letter reads:</p>
<p>Jiangyin is a place you have visited before and know well. May I describe the current state of education in Jiangyin? I wonder if you will have a sense of comparing the present with the past? In Jiangyin, in addition to Nanjing Advanced Normal School, there are county-run schools such as Jiyang (also known as Liyan) Academy, Xijiao Academy, and Liangfeng Academy. Although the assets of these academies cannot compare with Nanjing Advanced Normal School, the larger ones have thousands of acres of land, and the smaller ones have no less than five or six hundred acres. As for the number of charitable schools and literary societies, and the abundance of public funds for scholars, it can be said to be unique in the entire province. The land assets of each charitable school and literary society are at least dozens of acres, and many are two or three hundred acres. These assets provide funding for successful candidates in the imperial examinations, tribute students, and for the expenses of successful candidates and public funds for scholars, as well as providing accommodation for students taking the county and prefectural examinations. In addition to the land for public funds, there are also assets for the two examination halls in the southeastern and western countryside. In total, the assets for education in the county amount to no less than 20,000 acres in the Cao and Sha areas. Combining this with the educational surtax on land and the donations collected from students in recent years, Jiangyin should have no concerns about the lack of funding for education. However, those who collect land taxes are all skilled in fraud. They take advantage of the frequent changes in the names of collection agencies and the lack of unified authority. Coupled with years of poor harvests and low grain prices, they invariably claim that the people are in arrears and massively embezzle the educational surtax on land that should have been collected over the years, amounting to more than 300,000 yuan. Is it truly the people who are in arrears? The school land has been seized and divided by powerful individuals in various towns and villages. Some have hidden it as their own private property, some have sold it and diverted the funds, and some have converted it into the foundation for private schools. The collected land rent is neither reported nor audited, and no one dares to inquire about it. If provincial inspectors come to request the account books for inspection, the cunning ones will invariably use the excuse of fearing that the funds will be taken over by the county for unified management, and delay submitting them, as if they can dispose of public funds without the government being able to inquire. The submitted rental registers are mostly copies, and accounts of tenants who have not paid rent are everywhere. Among them, there are one or two people managing thirty or forty acres of school land and receiving more than three hundred yuan in rent per year. Comparing this with the others, are the so-called arrears really in arrears? The people handling the funds only care about their own well-being. It is no wonder that the annual budgeted income of more than 200,000 yuan is not enough to cover the annual expenditure of 140,000 yuan and still feels insufficient, resulting in arrears of six or seven months of funding for various schools and halls. Those who control the school land in the towns and villages not only profit from it but also control the appointment and dismissal of principals and teachers within their sphere of power. Those who are not of their kind are not allowed to join them, as their embezzlement is easily exposed. As a result, unqualified individuals are allowed to muddle through, and unqualified teachers fill the schools. With such management, it is difficult to talk about results. Therefore, although there are no fewer than 350 schools in the county, with more than 400 classes, the number of children enrolled should reach 20,000 to 30,000. However, most of the village schools have few students and are nominal. The summer vacation has not been shortened, and there are no measures for make-up classes. As soon as they hear that a provincial inspector is coming to the county, they rush to report false holidays, giving the provincial inspector the cold shoulder. They think they have succeeded, but how can they not feel guilty about delaying the children's education? Is this how teachers should behave? Alas, to run education in this way, it would be better not to run it at all! (Below omitted) October 25th.</p>

<p>(Nanjing, 27th) Lei Zhen, director of the general affairs group of the National Games, said that the accounts of this Games are still being settled, and the numbers circulating outside are not yet the confirmed numbers after settlement. It is estimated that the expenditures of this Games should be around 110,000 yuan. The Executive Yuan has agreed to retroactively approve 39,000 yuan, which, combined with the original budget of more than 79,000 yuan, will total more than 118,000 yuan, which should be sufficient. The expenses for transportation and accommodation were the highest for this Games, accounting for about 50,000 yuan, nearly half of the total budget. Staff salaries and equipment accounted for another 20,000 yuan, and the rest was for temporary miscellaneous expenses.</p>

The schools participating in this year's league include Shanghai High School, Guanghua, Jinan, Chizhi, Daxia, Fushi, and Pudong, a total of seven schools. Each school has two singles players and one doubles team. The competition uses a knockout system, with a best-of-three match format to determine the winner. Yesterday's matches were very evenly matched. Except for Guanghua vs. Shanghai High School, where Guanghua won one singles and one doubles match, eliminating Shanghai High School (2 to 1), the other match between Fushi and Chizhi saw each team win one singles match and one doubles set. The third set was stopped due to darkness when Chizhi was leading 3 to 2. This match, along with the unfinished match between Pudong and Jinan (each winning one singles match and one doubles set), will be continued at the original venue starting at 1:30 PM this afternoon. The winners of these matches will then compete against Guanghua and Daxia in the quarterfinals at 2:30 PM. The results of yesterday's matches are recorded below:</p>

<p>The China Race Walking Association originally planned to hold the third men's and women's open race walking competition on the 29th of this month. However, considering the short amount of time and insufficient preparation, the committee decided to postpone it to November 12th, as previously reported. A full-course practice will still be held tomorrow, Sunday morning at 7:00 AM, to give participants more opportunities to practice. The women's one-mile race will also have ample time for practice. Recently, there has been an enthusiastic response to registration, with over a hundred men and groups such as Chenguang, Huxi, and Sanduo, and over thirty women. However, there are still unregistered participants not included in this count. It is expected that both the men's and women's groups will have fierce competition. If there are any good race walking practitioners who are not familiar with the technique, they can inquire at the association at Moore Memorial Church on Xizang Road. Groups can send a letter requesting to send someone to guide them. As for the prizes that have been received, Mayor Wu of this city has awarded a large silver shield each for the men's and women's champions. Director Yang of the Security Department has donated a large silver shield for the winner of the China Race Walking Association. Shaonian Yongpin Gongyingshe has awarded a large silver cup each for men and women. Biaozhun Yundong Qiju Gongsi has awarded a large silver cup each for men and women. Qinfen Shuju has awarded a full year's subscription to the men's and women's Tiyu Yuebao. Shangwu Yinshuguan's Wang Yunwu has awarded a thick volume of the dictionary. In addition, race walking seniors Zhang Daoxin and his wife have awarded a large silver cup each for men and women. Aijieke has awarded an elderly cup. It is said that there are more prizes being rushed to be made.</p>

<p>Sixteen people participated in this China Youth Handball Tournament. In the blink of an eye, one week has passed. Zhu Kuan, Sun Daosheng, and Hong Yukui still maintain their first, second, and third place positions. Sun Baoqi also remains unchanged, holding ninth place. However, Huang Kesu has made rapid progress, advancing two levels, and Gao Zishou and Hua Fenggang have each risen one level. Their skills seem to have improved significantly compared to before. Yan Zhaorong participated in this competition for the first time this year and has been steadily improving from sixteenth place. As for Hong Rulin, Cheng Zhenhua, Lu Mengsheng, and Yu Guanghan, they all encountered strong opponents and dropped one position. Overall, the players in this competition have gained considerable benefits in terms of spirit and technique. If they can work harder, they will definitely be able to avenge their past defeats in this year's international competition.</p>

<h3 id="e237">Fashion on the Head <a href="#e237" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c237" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">237</a></h3>
<p>— You Xing</p>
<p>Just like the buildings in Shanghai, although Shanghai fashion changes faster than houses are rebuilt, it has never achieved its own unique style! The people of Shanghai are extremely busy, and everyone feels satisfied if the number of manufacturers and fashion stores keeps increasing.</p>
<p>Naturally, due to Shanghai's position, it is impossible to reject foreign influences on life in all aspects. Therefore, the so-called "own" characteristics are easily eliminated and difficult to regenerate. But isn't the cheongsam with a high collar and high slits called Shanghai fashion? Now let's talk about this kind of fashion:</p>
<p>Originally, there was no habit of wearing hats, and there was also a head of wavy, beautiful hair. Ladies and women were not afraid of sun or wind, so Shanghai fashion lacked half of its creative work! The changes in the cheongsam itself could not escape the collar, length, sleeve length, and the raising or lowering of the slits, longer or shorter lengths, plus a little arrangement of buttons and the width of the edging. Shanghai fashion also saves a lot of tailoring work! Therefore, the quality of the fabric directly affects the beauty of the fashion; and the choice of patterns on the fabric is even more important than the tailoring! Don't all ladies and women personally go to large companies or silk shops to choose the most fashionable fabrics and then go home and ask a tailor to make them?</p>
<p>This way of talking is not intentionally criticizing Shanghai fashion, but rather hoping that Shanghai ladies will pay attention to this issue: Do we need to wear hats? Are there any shortcomings in the popular tailoring methods? How to modify them? What standards should be used for choosing fabrics? The purpose of this discussion is to try to raise some questions and respectfully ask the ladies of Shanghai to put the effort they put into choosing fabric patterns into personally creating or building new tailoring methods, and to take the time to study "fashion on the head" (growing hair? wearing a bun? wearing a hat? tying a knot? ...). It is not necessary to adopt the styles of European and American fashion, but it is possible to imitate their efforts in studying fashion. From this, we can obtain, like the new City Hall building in architecture, a relatively "perfect" and "own" Shanghai fashion.</p>
<h3 id="e238">The Impact of Fashion on the Economy, Continued <a href="#e238" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c238" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">238</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Tao</p>
<p>Peculiar Interests, Frantic Decoration</p>
<p>The Popularization of Fashion</p>
<p>In terms of materials, due to the excessive consumption of decorations, almost all beneficial birds and animals have been destroyed, because some types of fur are becoming extinct. Therefore, there is a desire to raise birds and animals artificially or to limit and protect hunting through regulations. For example, modern European and American women's shoes, handbags, wallets, etc., all love to use crocodile skin. It is said that these animals are almost completely extinct in South America.</p>
<p>Modern industrial economics are making products increasingly popular; fashion certainly cannot escape this trend. From a social perspective, this is indeed a matter of great concern. Because this trend can lead to a large volume of consumption and reduced costs, which allows large industries to exist. In industry, the need to create cheap goods is necessary. Current fashion is not only for wealthy women, but also to allow all women in society to dress fashionably. Everyone wants their women and children to dress beautifully; maybe they even want them to dress better!</p>
<p>Also, clothing with environmental, regional, and custom colors has great historical value; however, in recent years, due to the uniformity and universality of fashion, it has gradually disappeared. At the same time, national borders may also be completely broken down. For example, the clothing of men and women in the country is rapidly becoming Westernized; there is a trend of only wearing and using Western things.</p>
<h3 id="e239">Recent News of Changes in Women's Clothing - Editor's Report <a href="#e239" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c239" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">239</a></h3>
<p>In the past, because the slits of the cheongsams were very high, except for bare legs in the summer, women wore long and brightly colored silk trousers with large leg openings, and the leg openings were decorated with beautiful lace; but recently, because the slits of the cheongsams have suddenly been shortened, only opening eight inches, those long trousers have been overthrown and replaced with short trousers.</p>
<p>In the previous issue, the editor reported that quilted cheongsams and fur-lined robes no longer had lace on the hems; however, in the past week, many modern ladies seen in social settings were wearing quilted cheongsams and fur-lined robes in a light lake blue color, and the lining was completely sewn to the outer fabric, unlike the first half of the year. (In the first half of the year, the lining of the robes was not sewn to the outer fabric.)</p>
<p>The copper-buttoned tweed overcoat with military colors was originally created by movie star Tan Xuerong last year, and everyone imitated it, making it popular for a while; however, this year, the most modern ladies have slightly changed the coat. The buttons have been changed to silk inlaid with mother-of-pearl that is darker than the color of the coat fabric; the hem of the coat is wider than last year; the belt is also made of wool that is darker than the color of the coat fabric; and a scarf made of the same color and material wool as the belt is also attached to the collar, which can be wrapped around the back.</p>
<p>According to news from fur merchants, the popular mass-market black leather triangle coats of last year are probably no longer popular this year; because this year, many modern ladies have bought badger fur to make coats (or leather woven with badger fur), and have used black silk ear-shaped fox scarves around their necks instead.</p>

<p>Recently, some people have used dark-colored pure wrinkled crepe to make cheongsams, with lotus-leaf-edged silk crepe on the cuffs, and the collar, lapels, and hem are inlaid with a black flat piping, and a wide silk edge is attached five and a half inches above the hem. The slits are still open two feet high. A short cape of satin is added to the cheongsam, which feels grand and luxurious.</p>

<p>My old friend Li Xianhuang is a big fat man. On the day of the Beginning of Summer, his whole family was weighed. Everyone else was weighed properly, some seventy catties, some eighty catties, and it was done in a while. Only when it was his turn to be weighed, the scale button rope broke twice, and he never succeeded in being weighed. His wife came up with an idea, picked up a thick lead wire, tied the hemp rope, and hung it firmly on the scale, so that the matter could barely be carried out. However, the weight kept pushing towards the scale tip, until the star marks at one hundred and forty-three catties were reached, and the scale bar above Xianhuang's head was level.</p>
<p>Because he was obese, he was very tired when he walked. If he walked from the bottom to the third floor, he had to rest for at least two minutes before his panting subsided. Because he felt that the long gown and mandarin jacket were inconvenient to wear, and his belly was big, the middle of the long gown often bulged roundly, like a watermelon placed on the table in summer, covered with a towel, drooping on both sides, and towering in the middle, which was very unsightly. Therefore, Xianhuang usually wore Western-style clothes, first because they were economical, and second because they were convenient. He was always very happy to meet friends. When others wore Western clothes, he always added two conditions in his introduction: the waist of the trousers must be made looser, especially the front and rear of the hips must not be too narrow. If the person being introduced was also a fat comrade, he honestly advised him to make two pairs of trousers.</p>
<p>I met Xianhuang almost every other day. I remember last winter, once I saw him wearing a navy blue serge suit, but the trousers were gray gabardine. I asked him, "Why are you wearing two colors again?" He said, "Don't mention it. I've only worn this serge suit for three months, and the crotch is broken again." As he spoke, he raised his leg and pointed to the broken place. I said, "Of course, that's because it's too tight." He said, "Nine out of ten of my trousers have this problem." He sighed from time to time as he spoke, and then said, "It's convenient to wear Western clothes, but if this hurdle can't be broken, big guys are too uneconomical. I hope the Western devils will step up their improvements to benefit fat people." After he finished speaking, everyone laughed!</p>
<h3 id="e242">Zhang Yipeng's Humorous Speech on Fashion in Suzhou <a href="#e242" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c242" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">242</a></h3>
<p>— Lili</p>
<p>In recent years, the clothing of women in Suzhou has gradually become Shanghai-ized. Therefore, new fashions in Shanghai often become popular in Suzhou in just a few days. However, since the demolition of the soil hills in the North Bureau of Suzhou, which have been transformed into singing halls and theaters, and since the opening of Hulong Street and Guanqian Street as roads, all popular items have been concentrated here. The prosperity of Changmen in the past has gradually declined, so the clothing in the Changmen area and the clothing in the Guanqian area have gradually become somewhat different. Changmen still retains its original literary talent, while Guanqian is very prosperous and has become a budding Shanghai-ized area.</p>
<p>Recently, the Shanghai Meiya Silk Weaving Factory and the Gantaixiang and Tongrenhe silk and satin shops in Suzhou held a three-day domestic silk and satin fashion show in the auditorium of the Suzhou YMCA. Because it was a first in Suzhou, it caused a sensation throughout the city. Some ladies and women brought bread and pastries as early as 11:00 AM to rush to the venue, willing to wait until the 2:00 PM opening of the show. The YMCA auditorium originally had only 400 seats, but each show was packed with 700 to 800 people, and there were many more people crowded outside the venue who could not get in.</p>
<p>Zhang Yipeng gave a speech on stage on the opening day, which was the most passionate and慷慨激昂. He compared domestic silk and satin to his own children and his own wife. He said, "We love our own children more than other people's children, no matter whether they are born handsome or whether they study hard, because they are our own children; we also love our wives very much, no matter whether they are beautiful or capable in managing the household, because she is my own wife. Therefore, domestic silk and satin are our own raw materials made by the Chinese ourselves, so we should love to wear them. What's more, how can people not love to use such good silk and satin from the Meiya factory?" Mr. Zhang Yipeng's beard and hair were already white, but his conversation was vivid, so he drew applause and laughter from the entire audience.</p>
<p>In the venue, many beautiful ladies were already looking at the various silks and satins displayed in the venue, and immediately bought them back to make new clothes and then came to the show again. Pure wrinkled crepe was probably the most worn by both men and women, and silk crepe was also popular. Many people also used silk satin to make coats.</p>
<p>At first, some people suspected that the fashion styles displayed were only meant to show novelty and were of no other use. Later, someone on stage explained each piece of fashion in detail, explaining why the crepe part was for what, what the effect of the short puff sleeves was, what the reason was for attaching a lotus leaf edge, and how the color matching was related to the seasons and festivals. There was no point that was not carefully considered. Everyone then understood that the fashion was indeed suitable for the season, age, body type, and environment, and was completely rationalized clothing, not just for showing off.</p>
<p>Before the performance, some people also misunderstood the purpose of coming to the show, which was to see the few female stars performing on stage, but Zhang Yipeng also explained that the performers were only sacrificing their appearance as a clothes rack because of the promotion of domestic goods, which everyone also understood very well.</p>

<h3 id="e243">Volume Adjustment Method <a href="#e243" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c243" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">243</a></h3>
<p>— Li Yuanqing</p>
<p>The volume of a radio is, of course, better the louder it is. However, in the following circumstances, it is necessary to apply appropriate restraint:</p>
<p>(1) To obtain undistorted sound.</p>
<p>(2) In public residences or densely populated areas.</p>
<p>(3) Late at night and early in the morning.</p>
<p>There are indeed many ways to adjust the volume, but very few are suitable for all conditions. This article details various adjustment methods and adds simple comments.</p>
<p>Increasing or decreasing the filament voltage to adjust the volume is the simplest and most economical method (see Figure 1A). However, on the one hand, increasing or decreasing the filament voltage, and on the other hand, keeping the screen voltage constant, then the electrons emitted from the filament are either too many or too few. As a result, the resulting sound waves are inevitably distorted. (This method is not applicable in AC radios, because the filament temperature of AC vacuum tubes increases or decreases very slowly.)</p>
<p>Connecting a variable resistor in parallel with the antenna circuit (as in Figure 1B) to adjust the volume can indeed avoid distortion. However, it cannot be applied in areas near strong broadcasting stations where it is possible to listen without an antenna.</p>
<p>Adding a variable resistor in the grid circuit can also adjust the volume (as in Figure 1C, D). However, adding many resistors to the tuning section will have a significant impact on selectivity.</p>
<p>Increasing or decreasing the amount of regeneration can sometimes also adjust the volume (as in Figure 1E). However, the range of rotation is limited, making it inconvenient to use. Too little and there is no sound, too much and it is easy to oscillate, disturbing the original sound.</p>
<p>Increasing or decreasing the screen voltage to adjust the volume is quite satisfactory (as in Figure 1F). BP is a bypass capacitor; adding it can avoid noise.</p>
<p>Connecting a variable resistor in series in the screen grid circuit is considered the most common and perfect method. Many radios sold on the market now use this method (as in Figure 1G) (To be continued)</p>
<h3 id="e244">How to Use a DC Voltmeter to Measure AC Voltage <a href="#e244" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c244" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">244</a></h3>
<p>— Yizhi</p>
<p>We know that DC voltmeters can only measure DC voltage. If you want to measure AC voltage, you must have an AC voltmeter. But now there is a simple method that can be used to use a DC voltmeter as an AC voltmeter. One meter for two purposes can save you from buying an AC voltmeter.</p>
<p>The reason why a DC voltmeter can measure AC voltage is that it uses the principle of rectification. The manufacturing method is very simple. The wiring method is shown in the figure. In addition to the existing DC voltage, only a dual- or triode vacuum tube is needed. The filament power supply of this tube can be supplied by dry batteries, storage batteries, or AC power. When in use, the voltage reading on the meter should be multiplied by a previously verified voltage multiplication factor (that is, the multiple of the difference between AC voltage and DC voltage. This number depends on the screen current, screen resistance, and meter impedance of the vacuum tube used. Because the voltmeter and vacuum tube used are different, the voltage multiplication factor must be verified for the first time). The product is the AC voltage value.</p>
<p>The author has a Weston Model 506, 0-15 Volts DC voltmeter. He used a 280 rectifier tube to connect it according to the figure to measure AC voltage. The voltage multiplication factor is 2.7. If a 201 tube is used, the voltage multiplication factor should be 3.3. For example, using a 280 rectifier tube for rectification to measure a certain AC circuit, the reading on the meter is 8 volts, then the voltage of this AC circuit is 8 X 2.7 = 21.6 volts (approximately).</p>
<p>The voltage multiplication factor is inversely proportional to the sensitivity of the meter. The more sensitive the meter, the smaller the multiplication factor and the greater the accuracy. Therefore, if you want to measure the correct voltage value in an AC circuit, it is best to use a sensitive and high-impedance DC meter. This point needs to be stated incidentally, so I will describe it.</p>
<h3 id="e245">High-Frequency Amplification of Transmitters (Continued) <a href="#e245" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c245" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">245</a></h3>
<p>— Ming Xiang</p>
<p>Class B amplification has no screen current when there is no excitation (of course, there is also no grid current), as mentioned above. Now, the oscillation stage is turned on, so that it forms a very loose coupling with the amplification stage. Then the input excitation voltage is extremely small, represented by curve A (figure see previous issue). At this time, the amplification stage has a very small screen current, but the grid current is still zero, because the excitation voltage is smaller than the original grid bias. Curve B represents the highest value of the excitation voltage, which is equal to the grid bias voltage. This is the point where the grid current is about to start flowing. If the coupling is firm, the excitation voltage can be made to exceed voltage C and generate grid current (when the shadow part of curve C). The grid current flows into the C battery, which is equivalent to charging the C battery. The reading on the grid current meter is its charging rate. If a resistor is connected in the C battery circuit, when the grid current flows through it, a voltage drop will inevitably occur across this resistor. This resistor is known as the grid leak GL. Its function is to help supply the grid bias. If only the voltage drop of the grid leak is used to supply the grid bias, and the C battery is not used, true class B amplification cannot be obtained. Because when the excitation is removed, the grid current stops, and the grid leak will of course not be able to produce a voltage drop to completely cut off the screen current. The last question is: How much grid bias is required for class B amplification? It can be calculated using the formula grid bias = 丨P/ц丨, Eb is the screen voltage, and ц is the vacuum tube amplification factor (which can be found on the vacuum tube characteristic table). After the grid bias is known, the resistance of the grid leak can be calculated according to Ohm's law: Grid leak = 丨E/I丨, where E is the grid bias, and I is the current indicated by the grid current meter.</p>
<p>The adjustment and compensation method of the amplification stage has been seen in this journal in the article "Adjustment Method and Steps of Shortwave Transmitters", so I will not repeat it. (The End)</p>

<p>— Micro-thoughts</p>
<p>丨丨The Current State of Broadcasting in the Country丨丨</p>
<p>Nanjing</p>
<p>But in fact, there are still many listeners in Nanjing who enjoy receiving broadcasts from Shanghai and Hangzhou. What is the reason for this? It is because: (1) "The love of the new and the dislike of the old" is a common human trait. For example, Nanjing pressed duck is certainly fatty and delicious, but eating it too much can make it feel bland and tasteless. The mouth and ears both belong to the five senses, and similarly, people get tired of listening to the same sound all the time.</p>
<p>(2) The station is directly under the Chinese Nationalist Party and is the only propaganda organ under party rule. Its stance and position are absolutely different from ordinary commercial or privately researched broadcasting stations. Therefore, it has a considerable range for the selection and direction of programs.</p>
<p>(3) Nanjing is a political rather than a commercial area. There are not many entertainment venues, making it very difficult to collect entertainment programs.</p>
<p>Now, within the possible scope, I would like to put forward two points as a humble offering to the station:</p>
<p>(1) Using radio to promote sports was indeed initiated by this station in the country. However, the broadcasting of national martial arts or morning exercises every morning is somewhat rigid and monotonous. This summer, the author heard a broadcasting station established by foreigners in Shanghai, which included light and beautiful Western music when broadcasting morning exercises. Listeners heard slogans such as "Up, down, left, right" on the one hand, and melodious and pleasant music on the other, which certainly made them feel supremely happy. If the station could imitate this approach, it would greatly increase the interest of the audience.</p>
<p>(2) Many people need some kind of entertainment after dinner to adjust their daily mechanical lives, so the station's music program from 12:00 to 1:00 pm is most welcome by the audience. Similarly, it is hoped that the station can also appropriately extend the duration of the music program from 6:00 to 6:30 pm every night.</p>
<p>It is said that the station has long considered laying special lines between Nanjing and Shanghai to enrich the program, but this has not been realized for the time being due to the high cost of equipment. If this plan can become a reality in the future, it will certainly make a special contribution in terms of programming.</p>
<h3 id="e247">Common Sense <a href="#e247" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c247" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">247</a></h3>
<p>— Huang Jiancun</p>
<p>(17) Overview of Vacuum Tubes (1)</p>
<p>(1) Overview: Vacuum tubes are to radio as the heart is to the human body. Everyone knows how important they are. Without the invention of the vacuum tube, the development of radio could not have reached its current peak. Today, the manufacture of vacuum tubes is constantly changing. First, there were diodes and then triodes, followed by tetrodes and pentodes, and then all kinds of new tubes that have recently appeared, with innovative patterns and a wide variety of types. There are so many types that we are almost overwhelmed. Here is a brief description of their types and content.</p>
<p>(2) Diode Vacuum Tube: As shown in the figure above, (a) is the general symbol for a diode vacuum tube, and (b) is its cross-sectional view. The tube is equipped with two electrodes: a filament and a plate, inside a high-vacuum glass tube. The filament is also known as the cathode. When electricity is applied to the filament, the filament emits negative electrons due to heat. The plate is also known as the anode, and its function is to absorb electrons. If the plate is connected to a positive charge, it can absorb the electrons emitted by the filament, and at the same time, a current (commonly known as plate current) flows from the plate to the filament. If the plate is connected to a negative charge, it cannot absorb electrons, so no current can flow. The rectifier tube used in AC radios is made using this principle. Therefore, diode vacuum tubes can perform rectification and detection. However, the sensitivity of using a diode for detection is far less than that of using a triode, so almost no one uses diodes for detection today.</p>
<p>(3) Triode Vacuum Tube: The above figure (c) is the general symbol of a triode vacuum tube, and (d) is its cross-sectional shape. The difference between a triode and a diode is that the former has an additional grid. As shown in the figure, the grid is located between the filament and the plate, and its function is to limit the flow of plate current into the filament, that is, the change in the grid voltage can increase or decrease the plate current. Moreover, although the voltage supplied to the grid is small and the current is weak, the change in plate current is considerably increased. This is because the vacuum tube has an amplification effect and can be used for high-frequency and audio-frequency amplification. In addition, the main functions of triodes are rectification, detection, oscillation, and amplitude modulation.</p>

<h3 id="e248">Carrying a Lantern Under the Moon <a href="#e248" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c248" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">248</a></h3>
<p>— Zhan Lu</p>
<p>It's not me talking nonsense. The Guangzhou Municipality's National Air Defense and Rescue Lantern Parade was held on a moonlit night during the Mid-Autumn Festival. More than sixty groups, with about five or six thousand people, actually had more than three thousand airplanes and more than one thousand anti-aircraft guns parading together. This is a vivid record in the Guangzhou newspapers.</p>
<p>Huh! Does China even have more than three thousand airplanes and more than one thousand anti-aircraft guns? Maybe I misread it and saw the character "ten" (十) as "thousand" (千). But, after rubbing my eyes, it's clearly "more than three thousand airplanes" and "more than one thousand guns." It's clearly "airplanes" and "anti-aircraft guns." The newspaper didn't misprint the type, and I wasn't seeing things. Okay! Okay! A corner of Guangzhou has this amazing number of airplanes and anti-aircraft guns. If we calculate ten Guangzhous for all the cities in the country, then there should be more than thirty thousand airplanes and more than ten thousand anti-aircraft guns. Then, China's air force is the best in the world, and China's air defense force is also the best in the world. Its international standing can leap ten thousand feet. Just wipe your nose and say in a classical style, "Isn't that delightful?" Ah, "Isn't that delightful?"</p>
<p>However, after looking closely, I found the problem. It turns out I overlooked a few words in the newspaper. The newspaper wrote: "Various groups crafted more than three thousand airplanes and more than one thousand anti-aircraft guns. There were about one thousand kinds of paper lanterns and gauze lanterns, and each lantern was written with the four characters 'National Air Defense and Rescue'." So that's how it is, more things made of paper and paste.</p>
<p>I have said in this column before that Chinese science is not backward. Only the paste doctors in the "exquisite" paper shops are showing off. The Guangzhou Municipality's National Air Defense and Rescue Lantern Parade is nothing more than a paste doctor showing off. This year, Su and Hu areas spent the Mid-Autumn Festival on rainy nights. Guangzhou's Mid-Autumn Festival night was moonlit and clear, but it held such a grand lantern parade with three thousand airplanes and more than one thousand anti-aircraft guns. It perfectly corresponds to a Su and Hu slang saying, "Carrying a lantern under the moon, shining in vain." 丨丨 The "shine" (明) is a homophone for "name" (名).</p>
<h3 id="e249">Unofficial Records of Taiwan <a href="#e249" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c249" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">249</a></h3>
<p>— Yan Qiao</p>
<p>In the middle of summer, my friend Wang Peizheng asked me if I had seen a classical Chinese historical novel like the "History Hidden in Bookshelves" called "Unofficial Records of Taiwan." I said no, and I checked several books on textual research of novels, but I didn't find this book title, so I assumed it was a unique copy. His friend spent seventy dollars to buy nine copies (missing one), so it wasn't a bad deal.</p>
<p>Recently, I happened to browse through "A Compendium of Notes and Novels" published by Civilization Book Company, and I found "Unofficial Records of Taiwan" in the fourth series. It had the same appearance as described by my friend Peizheng. It was written by Jiang Risheng from Zhupu, Fujian. According to Chen Qiyong's preface written in the year of Jia Shen, Kangxi (42nd year): "I, the priest of Nanzhao, met Jiang Zidongxu from Jiaojiang in the spring of Yichou (24th year of Kangxi). He was a gentle, honest, knowledgeable gentleman. Later, he published his compiled 'Unofficial Records of Taiwan' in thirty volumes. ... It was written specifically for the Zheng family. ... This book uses Fujianese people to talk about Fujianese affairs, detailing the beginning and the end, widely collecting materials, and differing from unofficial novels. It can certainly be used for historical selection." So, this book has been published for more than 220 years, and the book often contains annotations, proving that what he said is indeed credible. Presumably, the author wanted to popularize the great achievements of overseas colonization in the past thirty-seven years to the people, and on the other hand, he wanted to gain the trust and acceptance of the scholar-officials, so he wrote it in a special style. However, there is one doubt: when he wrote this book, Kangxi was not dead yet, so he should not have called him the "Holy Ancestor." Or perhaps Chen's preface is fake.</p>
<p>From his annotations, we know that Risheng's father, Meiao, followed the Earl of Yongsheng Zheng Cai to serve as a supervisor on the river with Hongguang, and later served as a general with the seal of Longxiang. He returned to the Qing Dynasty in the year of Dingji. So he was also a remnant of the Ming Dynasty, so he did not dare to miss the former master, so he had to miss the heroes of the isolated island. However, between the lines, it has already been polished smoothly and roundly, and everywhere is an expression of a compliant subject.</p>
<p>The entire book has thirty volumes, and each volume has a seven-character chapter title. The parallelism is not neat, such as "General Shi discusses leaving Taiwan, and the Great Qing Dynasty has peace in the four seas." It can be seen that he is not very familiar with the writing methods of chapter-style novels, so he does not even use conclusions like "If you want to know what will happen next, listen to the next chapter."</p>
<p>There are several transliterated words in Chinese. Some come from English, such as "赤般" (Chiban), which is said to be a ship name, probably "Ship." Others include "哔吱," "哆囉呢," etc. It even mentions that the Japanese were afraid of the Tang people along the coast and even removed the rudders of large and small ships, not allowing "unfilial Japanese people to go abroad to rebel." How long ago was it that Taiwan, which had been hard-earned, was handed over to the "unfilial Japanese people." Not only that, but it also had to be added to the "old nest of the Great Qing Dynasty" of "peace in the four seas." How can we not be indignant when we read this book?</p>
<p>I think this book is worth giving a new look and reprinting. It's more meaningful than just shouting slogans to recover lost territory.</p>
<h3 id="e250">Poets and Wine <a href="#e250" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c250" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">250</a></h3>
<p>— Yong Wen</p>
<p>Because of the saying "Wine can delight my nature, and poetry can express my feelings," poets since ancient times, with the exception of Wang Anshi, who did not understand the "poetic and wine affair," have been immersed in alcohol all day long, living their "one spring spends a long time buying flowers, and every day I sleep drunk next to the flowers," "I sleep when I'm drunk and drink when I'm awake; what's the point if I'm not crazy?" life of "poetic and drunken extravagance."</p>
<p>As soon as poets see wine, they reveal the appearance of "drooling at the sight of a wine cart on the road," wishing they could "get drunk today if there is wine today, and empty the limited cup in front of me," even if they are fortunate enough to be summoned by the emperor, they still recite "The emperor calls me, but I won't get on the boat. I claim to be a wine immortal," naturally disobeying the imperial edict in the identity of a "wine immortal." Therefore, in the eyes of poets, they only hope "three hundred and sixty days a year, drunk as mud every day," ignoring everything else, and still saying, "The universe is vast in drunkenness" and "Getting drunk for twenty-nine days a month is better than being awake for twenty-nine days for the world!"</p>
<p>The "wine desire" of poets is truly fully expressed. Look, they drink wine for farewell: "A cup of wine comforts the parting face"; they drink wine for leaving: "Wanting to go but not going, let's empty our cups"; they drink wine while talking: "Talking about mulberry and hemp with wine"; even how long they stay at the homes of relatives and friends is determined by whether there is wine or not: "But if the host can make the guest drunk, he doesn't know where his hometown is!" Other things such as climbing mountains and playing in the water, they must "drink three hundred cups" and "first try to get drunk as mud."</p>
<p>Poets are mostly prone to melancholy, so they want to express the complaint of "There is nowhere to go after drinking this body." Therefore, drinking "goose yellow" (yellow wine) is also a manifestation of trying to forget their worries! Otherwise, why say: "How to relieve worries? Only with strong wine"? And why would they write poems like "A five-flower horse, a thousand-gold fur coat, call the boy to take it out and exchange it for fine wine, and drink it with you to dispel all the sorrows of eternity," "float this thing to forget worries," "a drunken solution to a thousand sorrows," and "Tears are separated in the cup, how to send tears into a sorrowful heart?"</p>
<p>The most famous wine drinker among poets, everyone knows, is Li Bai. If you don't believe me, look at the horizontal plaque "Legacy of Taibai" hanging in the wine shop, and you can know the great amount of wine Taibai drank. But Chen Xuan, who wished people to inscribe his tomb after his death with "The Spirit Path of Chen Jun, the Former Wine Friend of Liang," and Liu Ling, who wrote "Ode to Wine Virtue," and Tao Qian, who prefaced "Drinking Poems," were not weak in their alcohol consumption either!</p>
<p>Short News: Cheng Yanqiu is going to Beijing this time due to the invitation from the National Games. Shao Yuanchong, Cao Xiangheng, Mao Heting and other celebrities in Beijing, as the old man Sanyuan also happened to come to Beijing, held an elegant gathering on the Double Ninth Festival of the old calendar, chosen to be held in the Saoyelou. It is said that more than sixty celebrities in the capital were invited, which was a grand occasion for a while. It is said that the old man Sanyuan intends to give a poem "Resistance to Frost." The old man has abandoned the matter of chanting poems for a long time because of illness. This is especially a good story for the art world. Cheng immediately set off to Shanghai the next day.</p>

<p>Chapter Seventeen: Who Can Be Heartless? Home Thoughts Gray the Morale; Soldiers Despise Not Deception, Brave Words Boost the Army's Spirit</p>
<p>Now that the battalion commander has mentioned letting him go back to Haidian to find a car, his heart suddenly moved. Isn't this an excellent opportunity to go home? Even if something in the camp is delayed, he can use the excuse of going out on official business. Thinking like this, he said to Battalion Commander Bao, "In that case, I'll go to Haidian and try to find one." Anyway, if I can't find a four-legged animal, is there anything I can't find among two-legged people?" Bao Fang smiled and said, "You can kill two birds with one stone. Going back to see your fiancée is much better than squeezing time to go back yourself, right? Actually, don't be so stupid and go looking for it yourself. Take a few brothers with you, and have the quartermaster follow along. You let them go out and look, and you stay at home and talk to the old man for a few words. Then, find your lady and sit in the milk tea shop, eating, drinking, and talking for two or three hours. Everything will be ready, and you can return to the camp in a grand manner. Wouldn't that be fun?" Zhao Ziqiang smiled wryly and said, "Battalion commander, do you think this is still fun?" Bao Fang laughed and said, "You don't need to say anything else. Hurry back." After this consideration, Zhao Ziqiang already felt eager to return home. Since the battalion commander was urging him, what was he delaying? So, he went back to the company headquarters, called the quartermaster to take a few brothers, and they went to Haidian together. Today, when he passed through that wilderness, he didn't know loneliness, and he didn't know sorrow. Naturally, there was no joy. He walked forward in such confusion. When he arrived on the street, he pointed out a few ways to the quartermaster and asked him to find a car. He walked home alone. When he walked toward his home, he naturally strode forward, but when he arrived at the gate, his legs suddenly felt weak and he couldn't lift them. The door was closed. He was about to reach out to knock on the door knocker, but when he was four or five inches away, he retracted his hand. He thought that he could say anything to his father. But if he met this new mother-in-law and told her that he was about to leave for Xifengkou, wouldn't that be like punching her in the chest? When he saw her face, he should hide it and not say it, right? Thinking like this, standing at the gate, he couldn't help but hesitate. (225)</p>

<h3 id="e258">Securities and Bond Markets Still in Turbulent Storms. Initial Covering of Short Positions Sees Slight Recovery. Large Investors Dump Stock, Leading to a Sharp Decline. Pre-Closing Rally Improves Market Price Again. The Result is Still a Drop of Around One Yuan. |The Future is Still Cloudy| <a href="#e258" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c258" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">258</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Securities Exchange only traded November futures for one month. Because rumors were rampant, trading remained extremely active, and market prices fluctuated constantly. The middle two sessions were the most turbulent. Numbers 33 and 50 were sold continuously from morning to evening, with number 50 being sold the most. Small investors followed the trend, blindly panicking, which further fueled the decline, as if a major disaster was imminent. Upon closer examination, there were no cracks in any aspect. The resignation of Finance Minister Song, whether true or not, was limited to personal issues and would not affect public debt funds. Creating waves out of nothing will only disturb ordinary people. Observing the situation on the floor, it was clear that both large and small investors were leaning towards short positions. Further declines in market prices will trigger investment based on fundamental value. The short positions' defense becomes increasingly strong, and any slight movement will lead to a strong reaction. Although rumors in the market are not credible, they are easily believed due to their vivid and detailed descriptions. It was also heard that new salt tax treasury bonds were being issued, but there was no confirmation of these rumors. Yesterday morning, the market opened with a slight recovery as some short positions were covered. The prices of various leading issues rose by several jiao to one yuan. However, starting from the 20th, number 50 began to sell off, and the market's confidence was already weak. Consequently, the market turned downward again, with a slight decline of several jiao. In the next session, the market uniformly declined, and number 50 sold even more aggressively, as if fearing that market prices would rise. Gold plummeted by 1.4 yuan, and other issues also fell by 7-9 jiao. The atmosphere turned negative again. In the afternoon session, number 50 continued to sell aggressively, and market prices continued to fall by one yuan. However, salt taxes were relatively stable. As the closing time was late, the evening news reports differed. On the trading floor, short positions were suddenly covered, and number 50 was surrounded by long positions. Market prices suddenly rebounded by several jiao to 1.2-3 yuan, fluctuating constantly. The future trend is still uncertain. The market price ultimately fell by several jiao to 1.1 yuan. The total trading volume was approximately 20 million. December futures will start trading on the 31st, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e259">New York Stock Market Declines <a href="#e259" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c259" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">259</a></h3>
<p>A report from the New Eastern Trading Company stated that on the 26th, the New York stock market declined because the government's gold price increased by only 1.8 jiao compared to the previous day, which disappointed those who hoped for inflation. However, all sell orders were absorbed by buyers, and the trading volume was not large, suggesting a potential rebound soon. The total trading volume for the day was 1,220,000 shares. "Wheat" initially declined due to weak buying power and negative news from Liverpool, but later rebounded strongly. "Cotton" weakened due to the stock market downturn, unfavorable exchange rates, and increased hedging from the South. Cotton prices are expected to depend on gold prices, and higher gold prices are anticipated. The spot market for cotton is very stable, and the gray cloth market is gradually improving. The "Silver" market is uncertain, with stable closing prices and an unpredictable future. The US Treasury's gold price is 31.54 yuan per ounce. The Dow Jones Index is listed below:</p>

<p>The yarn market is trending upward, and the situation is quite strong because a certain association is making efforts to purchase. They have bought 7-8 thousand bales this month, and all floating goods have been almost completely collected. At the same time, actual demand is growing, boosting confidence. Short positions are being covered in large quantities. However, as the market closed, this month was the last session. The price was called out at 3.4 yuan, but the association raised the price to 5.5 yuan to absorb as much as possible. Therefore, the price was fixed at 5.5 yuan. It is said that the association collected a total of over 20,000 bales.</p>

<p>The cotton market remains strong, but American cotton is weak and sluggish. Nevertheless, sentiment is firm, and some short positions are being covered. However, inventories from all sources are becoming increasingly abundant, so Japanese traders are also bearish. Spot cotton business is relatively brisk, so the market rebounded at closing. The future situation lacks certainty.</p>

<p>Yesterday's American cotton market lacked major buyers. Wall Street was weak, and long positions were closed, leading to a decline.

Egyptian cotton spot prices rose by three points. The Bombay cotton market initially rose due to purchases by Japanese traders, but later fell as some long positions were closed.

<h3 id="e267">Grain: Imported Wheat Quotes Lead to Decline in Marked Flour <a href="#e267" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c267" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">267</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the flour market opened in the morning, prices for all months uniformly showed a declining trend. The quotes for imported wheat from Chicago fell by 8-9 jiao to 1 yuan, and those from Canada fell by around 5-6 jiao. Therefore, sentiment became unstable immediately after the opening. The continuous rise in prices in recent days seemed to be largely driven by foreign markets. Now that foreign markets have fallen, it is difficult for the market to remain strong. Opening prices were already 2 fen lower than the previous day, and prices continued to fluctuate. By the time the afternoon market opened, the current month was still showing weakness. However, due to indications of purchases by mills, the decline was weaker. November and December saw less of a decline due to fewer offerings. However, prices for January and later months fell sharply because a certain mill had been gradually offering stock, and it was rumored that Australian wheat prices were favorable, at around 4.5 yuan. Observing the subsequent trend, if imported wheat quotes decline, the market is expected to remain weak. Otherwise, a stable situation is expected. As a result, the current month fell by 3.25 li compared to the previous day, November fell by 2 fen, December fell by 1.75 li, January fell by 4 fen, and February and March fell by 4.25 li.</p>
<h3 id="e268">Distant Month Wheat Follows Imported Wheat Decline. Current Month Uniquely Strong Due to Delivery Products Being Purchased by Mills <a href="#e268" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c268" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">268</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the forward wheat market opened in the morning, all months showed a decline. The quotes for imported wheat from Chicago fell by 8-9 jiao to 1 yuan, and those from Canada fell by 5-6 jiao. Therefore, sentiment was uniformly unstable after the opening, and selling pressure was quite strong. Prices for all months fell by 2-3-4 fen compared to the previous day. By the time the afternoon market opened, sentiment for the near term suddenly improved greatly. Because the current month was the last day, the opening price was only 3.8 yuan, but it secretly increased by 5 fen in the afternoon, and then continued to improve. It was heard that the month-end delivery products will be purchased by major mills, greatly boosting sentiment. November also rose as a result. The distant months were still flat. At closing, the current month rose by 3 fen, November rose by 2 fen, December fell slightly by 1 fen, January fell slightly by 2 fen, and March fell slightly by 1 fen. The spot wheat market saw brisk trading. High-quality wheat was also offered at 2-3 fen higher. Qingjiang wheat opened at 3.92 yuan, Qintong wheat at 3.87 yuan, Wuhu wheat at 3.68 yuan, followed by 3.65 yuan, and Zhenjiang wheat at 3.57 yuan. Wuxi wheat was at 3.52 yuan. Fuxin went to 2,000 bags, and Fufeng went to 1,000 bags.</p>
<h3 id="e269">Kiln Mid-Grade Paddy Rebounds by a Few Jiao <a href="#e269" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c269" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">269</a></h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, there were over 40 sources, with approximately 5,000 shih of goods. The bulk and retail sales were relatively large. There were 1,100-1,200 packages of kiln mid-grade paddy, and 4-5,000 shih of new premium from various shops and gangs. Kiln mid-grade paddy and similar grades have become scarcer recently, and the market has turned around, with prices rebounding by a few jiao. Broken glutinous rice is still weak and sluggish. Du Yang premium rice has been arriving in large quantities, leading to oversupply and a price decline of a few jiao. New shade-dried Yuan rice has limited sales and is also weak.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, 35-36 sources arrived from various locations downstream, and sales were sluggish. New glutinous rice, Yang premium rice, and Port premium rice are in tight supply. Broken glutinous rice, White Yuan rice, Shade Yuan rice, Du premium rice, Kiln grade rice, Mid-Grade rice, Old thin paddy, and Traveler premium rice are all stable.</p>
<h3 id="e270">Japanese Traders Repatriate Foreign Rice Arriving in Fujian, Quanzhou Gang Suspends Handling Guest Xian Rice <a href="#e270" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c270" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">270</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the guest Xian rice market was originally seeing limited arrivals and expensive Xiang Xian rice due to high costs. High prices were set for sales, and distress sales were not seen. As Japanese small exchanges were also withdrawn, there was a need to boost sentiment and the market. However, yesterday the Quanzhou gang followed the Fuzhou gang in suspending the handling of guest Xian rice. Due to this blow, the market softened. The reason for the Quanzhou suspension was that the repatriated small exchanges that Japanese traders intended to transport to Shanghai for sale had been properly negotiated with the Min gang (Fujian gang). Most of them were transported to Fujian, with the first and second batches already arriving in Fujian with a large number. Some say 25,000 bags, others say 50,000 bags. Fuzhou had already slowed down and was even withdrawing. The Quanzhou gang also suspended yesterday. All gangs from Spring and other southern provinces, as well as Wen and Yong, unanimously stopped. The market showed a downward trend. Fortunately, the goods owners were unwilling to sell cheaply, so the market was weak but stable. The total domestic sales for the day included 30 bags of Xian rice, 220 bags of coarse rice were sold to Beijing from the local street, and Fuzhou perfunctorily purchased 51 bags of Hunan machine-milled Jing rice and 268 bags of Anqing Xian rice. Prices were similar to the previous market.</p>
<h3 id="e271">Soybean Sales Turn Slow <a href="#e271" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c271" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">271</a></h3>
<p>The soybean market had been quite firm recently due to active sales. However, train-delivered beans are rarer than ship-delivered beans because fewer trains are loaded. Yesterday, sales suddenly slowed down, and factories also stopped handling them, causing general sentiment to soften. Market prices fell slightly by 2-3 fen. The total sales in the city were over 400 bags of ship-delivered goods and 3-4 cars of train-delivered goods, which were sold to local streets and inland. The market for remaining Shazhou yellow soybeans also softened. Du soybeans were not being received, so the market was relatively stable.</p>
<h3 id="e272">Silk and Tea: Overseas Silk Prices All Rise <a href="#e272" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c272" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">272</a></h3>
<p>Lyon Factory Reports Clear and Secret Price Increases. Although actual sales have not yet started in the Lyon raw silk market, silk prices have been increasing both openly and secretly. Recently, over the past three to four days, the French franc exchange rate has gradually decreased, and the price of Chinese silk has sharply increased. The Shanghai White Factory A-grade had previously fallen to 810 yuan but rose to 840 yuan yesterday. B-grade had previously opened at just over 740 yuan but opened at 770 yuan yesterday, an increase of 30-40 yuan per bale.</p>
<p>35 Pieces of Tin Factory Silk Shipped to Shanghai. The Wuxi manufacturers have only offered a limited amount of forward silk this month, so shipments to Shanghai have been scarce. With only three or four days left until the end of this month, 35 pieces of White Factory silk under the Moon Rabbit brand and others were shipped to Shanghai yesterday in preparation for month-end delivery.</p>
<p>Rayon Market Exchange Rate Weak, Price Increases. In recent days, both domestic and foreign exchange rates have decreased, and the price of rayon has sharply increased. Customer sales are increasingly clear. Yesterday, only Hangzhou silk merchants purchased 20 boxes of spot goods from Green Goldfish, Flying Eagle, and Three Star brands, with prices ranging from 175.5 yuan to 169.25 yuan net.</p>
<p>Shanghai Port Silk Sales Still Difficult to Improve. Since the US government implemented price increases, New York raw silk prices have risen with the stock market. In addition, the exchange rate has decreased, and hoarders have taken the opportunity to raise prices, resulting in a sharp increase in silk prices by 40-50 yuan in recent days. European and American firms in Shanghai port are eager to cover short positions, but the opening price is still over 100 yuan different from the cost of Chinese silk, making it difficult to complete transactions. Yesterday, only Xinfu and others purchased 50 bales of Huangbai Factory silk, with prices trending upward.</p>
<h3 id="e273">Tea Market Transactions Sparse <a href="#e273" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c273" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">273</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, in the foreign-owned tea market, only Xiehe, Tongfu, Yongxing, and other firms purchased needle eyebrow pearl tea and other varieties, totaling 170 boxes. Needle eyebrow sales ranged from 36 yuan to 50 yuan, and pearl tea sold for 62 yuan, with no increases or decreases from the previous few days. As for Lüzhuang Zhenmei green tea, it was heard that Yihua, Baochang, and other firms have new negotiations, but no deals have been completed.</p>
<h3 id="e274">Sugar Market: Wufu White Ice Opens at Over 200, 18.4 Yuan <a href="#e274" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c274" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">274</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, despite the increase in Customs Gold Units, the sugar market remained sluggish, with no signs of improvement. The guild quoted 24 coarse-grained white ordinary sugar, with Changxing firm offering 200 bags at a price of 21.15 yuan. The 20 medium-grained white sugar and Dutch Red Factory white sugar were all quoted at the original price and no transactions were made. Dalaihua firm offered over 200 boxes of standard Wufu white ice sugar at a price of 18.4 yuan.</p>

<p>Hailing Pong is currently selling even better. Those who make Western suits all choose this material. Evergreen, camel gray two colors are selling well. A survey of the current inventory in and out of the city shows that there are not many goods. Buyers are competing to buy, and sellers generally regard them as rare goods, making the market situation better. Selling prices are gradually increasing. Most of the goods around 5 yuan and 6 yuan are out of stock. Yesterday, the lowest price sold was 6.25 yuan, still without bristles. Higher-end bristle-colored goods wholesale are rising and selling at 7 yuan. The Lin Nan brand number one is 8 yuan, and number two is 7.5 yuan, it is said.</p>

<h3 id="e276">Chinese Writing and the Chinese People <a href="#e276" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c276" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">276</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Ming</p>
<p>Recently, a very good translation was published: "The Chinese Language and Chinese Writing" by Bernhard Karlgren. Mr. Karlgren is a Swede. His real name is Karlgren. Why is he "surnamed" Gao? That is undoubtedly because he has become Sinicized. He has indeed made great contributions to Chinese philology.</p>
<p>However, he seems to have more research on the Chinese people. Therefore, he admires classical Chinese and Chinese characters, believing that they are indispensable for the Chinese people.</p>
<p>He said: "Recently [note: Mr. Gao's book was published in London in 1923], some newspapers have tried to use vernacular Chinese, but they have not been very successful; therefore, perhaps they will also anger most subscribers, believing that this is implying that they cannot understand classical Chinese newspapers!"</p>
<p>"In Western countries, there are many actors who can insert many 'jokes' at almost any time during their performances, and there are also many authors who overuse literary quotations; but everyone recognizes this as an inferior style. In China, the opposite is true; this is considered a high-level elegance and a display of exquisite skill."</p>
<p>The "ambiguity of Chinese writing not only does not cause difficulties for the Chinese people, but they are willing to cultivate it."</p>
<p>However, Mr. Gao himself has suffered enough humiliation because of this: "The author of this book can fully understand what is said to him when he talks with dear Chinese people; but when they talk to each other, he hardly understands a word." This is naturally those "dear Chinese people" "implying" that he does not understand the language of the upper class because "foreigners who come to China only need to pay attention to one point, and he can feel that although he is familiar with the language of ordinary people, he is still confused about the conversations of the upper class."</p>
<p>So he said: "Chinese writing is like a beautiful and lovely noblewoman, and Western writing is like a useful but ugly servant."</p>
<p>The "exquisite skill" of the beautiful, lovely, and useless noblewoman lies in the ambiguity of "inserting jokes." This makes the best Western scholars at most equal to ordinary people in China, and they cannot hope to climb into the upper class. In this way, we have "spiritually triumphed." In order to maintain this victory, we must have a sophisticated and elegant vocabulary, and it must be rich! The "lack of great success" of the May Fourth vernacular movement was largely due to the upper class fearing that people would imply that they did not understand classical Chinese.</p>
<p>Although, "This is one right, and that is another right!" [We] might as well be more ambiguous. Otherwise, we will suffer difficulties instead.</p>
<h3 id="e277">Look Again |Continuing to Talk About Wrongly Written Characters| <a href="#e277" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c277" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">277</a></h3>
<p>— Cao Juren</p>
<p>An American scientist named Slosson once calculated that if the person who first created the word "Electric" had simply combined it with two or three letters, he did not know how much he would save in pens, ink, writing effort, and typesetting effort. But our Mr. Tao Tiran is worried about my surname, fearing that writing it as "Curved Sun Cao," missing a stroke, would lose some dignity. Whenever there is a reform of writing, it is always intellectuals who claim to know some square characters who come out to oppose it; this is nothing more than fearing that the general public will gain the opportunity to use writing, and that their only skill will completely lose its effectiveness and have to be relearned, and they are afraid of relearning. The subconscious mind of mocking young people for writing wrongly and the psychology of cherishing writing are consistent. (When Turkey implemented writing reform, the opposition from intellectuals was the strongest; there were also many intellectuals who opposed the national phonetic alphabet and the Roman alphabet: knowing more square characters is the only property of intellectuals, so the fear of loss is the greatest.)</p>
<p>Professor Whitney said: "Writing does not belong to individuals, but to each member of society... What each of us wants to say cannot become language and writing until everyone adopts it. The entire development of language begins with individuals, but is completed by society." Therefore, writing is a common currency. No one will be willing to use the banknotes of a bankrupt bank. Reading wrongly written characters and writing wrongly written characters is not an accidental phenomenon. In the past and present, people of all colors, high, middle, and low, have done so. If we do not follow the trend to seek remedies, such as constantly correcting them as Mr. Tiran advocates, then the "Explanation of Characters" states: "Immersion follows reason." This immersion character. "Lecherous" states: "Private abandonment." Adultery states: "Committing lechery." This chaste lecherous character. "May I ask, Mr. Tiran, can you grab every scholar and tell them, 'Lecherous should be written as lecherous'?" The Qi Li Long in the middle of the Qiantang River, this "Long" should be pronounced "Shuang": May I ask, Mr. Tiran, can you grab passersby and tell them, "Long should be pronounced Shuang"? During the Jiaqing period of the Qing Dynasty, a certain official stated that "the people in the capital call Xuanwu Gate Shunzhi Gate, Zhengyang Gate Qian Gate, and Chongwen Gate Hada Gate. It is appropriate to order them to correct it." The emperor ordered him to start correcting them from a certain day at the Qian Gate when he met people. Mr. Tiran is enthusiastic about correcting wrongly written characters, and I want to copy this and go to correct them when I meet people! (For example, "this one" should be "zhe ge," the "ran" in "tiran" is the "burn" character, and the "burn" character should not be used separately; the "clown" character "chou" should be written as the "cuan" character.)</p>
<p>Writing wrongly written characters and reading wrongly written characters is not without rules. In 70-80% of cases, there is a relationship in sound, either the same consonant (partial alliteration or alliteration) or the same vowel; such as "wrongly written character" written as "blank character," "wrong" and "blank" are alliterative, "hearth" is written as "ugly," "hearth" and "ugly" are alliterative. In the remaining 20-30% of cases, there is a relationship in the shape of the characters, mostly simplification; such as "tofu" written as "dou fu," "one head of cattle" written as "one bean of cattle," "yin yang" written as "yin yi," "a hair's breadth" written as "a hair's width." Following the first trend, Chinese writing can be completely transformed into new phono-semantic characters; following the second trend, Chinese writing can be completely transformed into simplified characters. The social reading of wrongly written characters and the writing of wrongly written characters is the precursor to reforming Chinese writing, which is why I have to look again.</p>
<p>As for theoretical discussions, I will write another long article and ask Mr. Tiran for guidance. (To be published in the 75th issue of Tao Sound)</p>
<h3 id="e278">Sun Yuanru and Huang Zhongze <a href="#e278" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c278" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">278</a></h3>
<p>— Zhu Xia</p>
<p>Huang Zhongze had extensive social interactions during his life, and Sun Yuanru was one of them. In the past, after reading Yuanru's "Cheng Qing Tang Drafts," I saw in the poems he wrote for Zhongze that their friendship was very close, and there was also a lot of historical material about Zhongze. Statistically, there are the following poems: (1) On Huang Er's Collection of Huangshan Mountain Paintings, (2) Composed with Huang Er Jingren during a Boat Trip in Runzhou, (3) Boating with Yang San (Lun), Hong Da (Liangji), and Huang Er (Jingren) to See Lotuses at Pingshan Hall, (4) Huang Er Jingren Returned from a Trip to Huangshan Mountain and Requested a Long Poem as a Gift, (5) Answering Hong Da's Work After Being Drunk, Simultaneously Thinking of Huang Zhongze, (6) Hong Da Asked for a Title for a Painting of Yunxi Melody, Along with a Shadow of Huang Da Jingren. From these poem titles alone, we can obtain some material. Among these poems, the one about "Huang Er Jingren's Return from a Trip to Huangshan Mountain and Requesting a Long Poem as a Gift" contains the most historical information. Although this poem is inevitably a social obligation, it can very well serve as a conclusion to Zhongze's southern travels. Zhongze's character, circumstances, family, and even his friendship with Yuanru, as well as his satisfaction after returning from his southern travels, are all visible in it. In other poems, such as "Seeing Lotuses at Pingshan Hall," which contains the line "One child knocks on the side of the boat, two children sing, my hand does not release the golden goblet," and the poem "Thinking of Zhongze," which contains the lines "The joys of life are like sparks of flint, after parting, tears fall in vain," and the poem "Hong Da Asked for a Title," which contains the lines "Not worried about the purple deer damaging the white fur coat, but only afraid that the mirrored pool will not reflect a beautiful face," as well as what is said in the poem "Huangshan Mountain Paintings," "After Huang Sheng left, the mountain colors died, clear water and white stones sadly trickled. Standing up straight, pointing out old places of play, entering and exiting, high and low, exploring difficulties," all of these can also be used as reference materials for Zhongze's history.</p>
<h3 id="e279">Words from Paradise <a href="#e279" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c279" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">279</a></h3>
<p>— Yi Cen</p>
<p>A very good friend from the past, after several years of separation, I hadn't received any news. Yesterday, I suddenly received a letter from him. He said he envied me living in this paradise-like metropolis and imagined I was living a very carefree life. He also told me not to forget him and asked me to introduce him to a job.</p>
<p>After reading this letter once, I couldn't help but smile bitterly for a while. I should have replied to him immediately, but I really didn't have the courage. Because what should I write on the letter in reply? If I truthfully told him about my recent situation, if he believed me, I was afraid it would greatly disappoint this friend I hadn't seen for many years. Or it might even cause him to feel some undeserved sadness for me. If he didn't believe me, then I was afraid it would cause him to misunderstand me and spread some gossip about me. Caught in such a dilemma, after some deliberation, I finally decided to reply to the letter. But the letter only described the scenes of being together with him in the past, and many past events, in vivid words. I said: In my life, I am afraid that only the past time was worthy of what you called "a very carefree life." Because at that time, I had just entered society, and I was naive and inexperienced. I didn't fully understand all the difficulties of life!</p>
<p>I also wrote: Do you envy me living in this paradise-like place? Indeed, this place is truly like paradise, with tall Western-style houses and wide roads. And on the roads, one can constantly see endlessly flowing, recklessly driving cars, inside which sit some foreign gentlemen and ladies. Relying on the protection of airplanes and warships, they transport all kinds of novel goods, cheat countless amounts of money from the Chinese people, and enjoy themselves.</p>
<p>There are also some special class of locals sitting in the cars, who are equally imposing and luxurious. Because they rely on their own abilities, or the opportunities given to them by their fathers, to exploit and plunder, and have made huge fortunes!</p>
<p>There are also women here whose numbers are constantly increasing, who live by selling their bodies, with faces covered in fragrant powder, wearing silk clothes, and being so charming and sensual that they bewitch people!</p>
<p>There are also speculators who arise in response to the times, who are good at understanding people's intentions, catering to fashion, and establishing numerous theaters, dance halls, ... countless alluring money pits!</p>
<p>As for the lives of other people in the paradise-like place he imagined, I never told him about it. Because I knew that when the other side of the situation was written out, it would definitely not be as lively as the front. Anyway, we are all people born in this era. Is it possible that there will never be a time when he understands?</p>
<h3 id="e280">Two Brothers (11) <a href="#e280" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c280" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">280</a></h3>
<p>— By Maupassant, Translated by Li Weike</p>
<p>Ten minutes later, they were having dinner in the small dining room downstairs.</p>
<p>At first, everyone was silent; but after a while, old man Roland began to question the notary's visit again.</p>
<p>"Why didn't he write a letter and come in person?"</p>
<p>Pierre found this very natural.</p>
<p>"It must be because he needs an answer immediately; and perhaps he has some secret clauses to tell us, and people don't like to write letters about this."</p>
<p>But the four people in the Roland family were still speculating about this, and all four felt in their hearts that they shouldn't have invited this irrelevant woman to dinner, making it inconvenient for them to argue and decide everything.</p>
<p>They had just returned to the living room on the second floor when the maid announced that the notary had arrived.</p>
<p>Roland hurried over.</p>
<p>"Good evening, dear Master (Maitre)."</p>
<p>He gave Mr. Lecarre the honorific title of "Master," which was originally attached to the names of all notaries.</p>
<p>Mrs. Lusuimi stood up and said:</p>
<p>"I'm going back, I'm very tired."</p>
<p>Everyone tried to persuade her to stay a little; but she was determined not to, so she left alone, unlike usual, when one of the three men would always accompany her.</p>
<p>Mrs. Roland hurriedly approached the new guest:</p>
<p>"Would you like a cup of coffee?"</p>
<p>"No, thank you, I just had dinner."</p>
<p>"Then, how about a cup of tea?"</p>
<p>"I won't say no, but a little later, let's talk about business first."</p>
<p>After the notary said these two sentences, everyone was silent, and only the rhythmic ticking of the clock and the sound of the maid washing pots downstairs were heard. This maid was so stupid that she wouldn't even eavesdrop outside the door.</p>
<p>The notary spoke again:</p>
<p>"Do you know a Mr. Marais in Paris, a Mr. Rene Marais?"</p>
<p>The Roland couple made the same exclamation of surprise: Indeed, they did!</p>
<p>"Is this a friend of yours?"</p>
<p>Roland said:</p>
<p>"A very good friend. But this is a Paris fanatic; he never wants to leave the streets of Paris. He is a director in the Ministry of Finance. I haven't seen him since I left the capital. And we haven't had any news for a long time. You understand, when we are very far apart..."</p>
<p>The notary said seriously:</p>
<p>"Mr. Marais has passed away."</p>
<p>Both the man and the woman had this small gesture of sorrow and surprise, which, whether feigned or real, people always immediately show when they receive such news. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e281">The Ladder of Life <a href="#e281" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c281" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">281</a></h3>
<p>— Li Qi</p>
<p>The means of livelihood for the more than three million residents of Shanghai are like a ladder. The layers are so numerous and excessive that they far surpass the Four-Bank Warehouse, which has not yet been fully constructed! Some people say that prostitutes lead a hellish life. In fact, in Shanghai, where the layers of life are so disparate, the lives of prostitutes are still considered to be in the middle and lower layers of many layers of hell!</p>
<p>Now, let's imitate the way of "climbing step by step" and exhibit the lives of Shanghai people, starting from the lowest layer, counting down step by step, and occasionally displaying them in parallel:</p>
<p>Below the basic point, one must naturally count those beggars who emit miserable cries in the streets and alleys, or strike their own bodies with bricks and tiles, or lead dogs to kneel at doors, or roll around the streets with mutilated limbs, risking a few drops of blood and hoarse cries in exchange for copper coins. Others who knock on clappers and oil drum buckets and sing from door to door are slightly "higher." As for the "Jiao Hua Tou," they should be considered to be "living in the attic" of the beggar layer, because there are still two or three layers below him.</p>
<p>One level "higher" should be the lumpenproletariat. Under this general term, there are also many levels to be divided. The most basic is the "Bi San Young Master," who wanders on the streets and eaves of houses, barely hanging a miserable smile on their sallow faces, begging for cold leftovers from various catering establishments. "Above," there are pickpockets and thieves; there are vendors of erotic paintings who take the Fourth Road as their base; there are "guides" for "swallow nests," "mirror polishers," and "Russian halls" ("clear water girls") who haunt North Sichuan Road and Aidoa Road; there are low-level rogues who sit in teahouses and haggle over prices; there are various nomadic peddlers; there are "tycoons" who dominate a street. Going step by step from the "tycoon" line, "Nine Turns Reviving Elixir," after several cultivations, you can keep rising to XX.</p>
<p>To the right of the lumpenproletariat are the formal proletarians: there are coolies who often treat cement as "Simmons" and burlap sacks as "coats," there are rickshaw pullers, there are apprentices who take "eating a living" and emptying chamber pots as their "central task," there are small workers; there are handicraft workers, there are industrial workers. Once they reach the foreman and clerk, they completely change their nature and become the capitalist's "paw layer," no longer proletarians.</p>
<p>One level "higher" are shop assistants. From apprentices, senior clerks, leaving the store, traveling salesmen, storefronts, accounting rooms, etc., the highest level of which has a life no less than that of middle-class freelancers, and the lowest level is as miserable as workers.</p>
<p>One level "higher" than shop assistants are small and medium-sized merchants. They are also divided into several levels: from the owners of sesame cake and fried dough stick shops and tofu shops, to small cigarette paper shops and grocery stores, rising in order of capital amount. When they reach company managers or have huge sums of money deposited in banks, they must be "evaluated" separately and not regarded as "bosses" anymore.</p>
<p>There is another level, which is freelancers. Starting from elementary school teachers who receive six or eight yuan a month in "stipends," clerks who earn fifteen to thirty yuan a month, the group of writers who sell words for rice, and the technical personnel of various organizations... rising in order, until "famous doctors" and "great lawyers" who earn thirty thousand or twenty thousand taels a month. The layers within this general term are four times as complex as "streaky pork"! In fact, teachers and low-level clerks who receive salaries below the standard, as well as nameless writers who are often hungry and use their brains to create wealth for book merchants, should all be called "long-gown workers." Their economic status and life pain are "two fives equal ten" with the working masses. The most popular famous doctors and great lawyers often also operate real estate or hold stocks, and are genuine bourgeoisie. The most depressed and often "pretending to be fat when their faces are swollen" are a large group in between "long-gown workers" and the above-mentioned capitalists who "moonlight": always rising and sinking, circling in the journey of life, worrying about gains and losses.</p>
<p>Going further up are the compradors, bureaucrats, and industrial or financial bourgeoisie. If they are good at dancing with long sleeves and climb further up, they will become "great" and be listed in the daily life notes of "officials coming and going" in Beijing and Shanghai. At the same time,</p>
