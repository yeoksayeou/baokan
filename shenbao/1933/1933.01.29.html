<p>㈠段芝泉氏南來</p>
<p>外寇日深。内爭未息。一載以還。東北三省同胞。仍呻吟於日本帝國主義鐵蹄之下。我政府雖明知國聯之無力解决此問題而尙希冀其能有最　之覺悟。稍持公理。敵方則得尺進丈。匪特目無國聯仗其兵力運用最野蠻極横暴之帝國主義政策。作成所謂（滿洲（傀儡）政府。）今且進而侵占榆關。刼制熱河威脅平津矣。尤有甚者。彼利用東北傀儡之餘。更挑撥關内動亂。收買舊時親日派諸人爲其爪牙冀在我華北造成第二滿洲。近月以來。傳説紛紜。而吉田梅津駒井諸人。或則以外交資格。公開往來。　則運用軍事秘密活動其目的何在。詭謀何在。凡我國人。應皆洞悉其用意。在乎　裂我民族之反日戰線。意圖樹立受日本帝國主義者指揮之另一政治組織。固無待煩言者也。在此種隂謀之下。段芝泉氏實爲日方認爲最適當之人物。而段氏此次竟奮共衰病之身。毅然南下。打破日人利用之詭謀。表現其個人之態度。吾人於此。不能不表示充分之同情。以其能不失匡救國難之良好機會。同意於我國民奮自力以求更生也。</p>
<p>㈡在鬭爭中訓練國人</p>
<p>果能精誠團結。（共赴國難。）固爲打破當前危機之一大動力。然而僅有最上層領導。論兵員僅止於招募補充論財力僅止於政府之搜索。乃欲與强敵爭疆塲之勝敗。烏可得乎矧日本軍問亦巳確知現代戰爭。非集全國民之力。利用一切科學上之設萬難制勝。故日本自發動侵略吾國以來。即高倡國難臨頭。激起其國民。而右傾團體。亦在軍部領導指揮之下。到處活躍。我國近年以來。政府與人民。固尙不免有所間隔。而社會上多數人得過且過之苟安心理。不能奮力有爲。確係今日之最大病根。設使多數人民亟起努力。對外固可制服强敵。内亦自可納政治於正軌矣。</p>
<p>今日之事。政治上之領導。應速圖穏固健全。僅以少數領袖之團結。殊不足以應付當前之危難。須以大衆集體實力爲基幹。奮全國民之偉力與强寇相鬥爭。乃能在死中求生。乃能克服内外交迫之矛盾。</p>
<p>我國國民性習尙和平。以致外宼升堂入室。猶自雍容揖讓。泰然處之。現以備受欺凌。漸自覺悟。今後尤當整刷精神。竭力奮搏。現代戰爭决定勝負之點。併不全撃疆塲上三五百萬兵員之砲火戰鬭。而國民支撑力。實爲勝負之重心。我國際此時期。應於鬭爭中訓練一般大衆。且必集大衆之力。方有抵抗力可言。否則失其團結一致之機能。烏能與强敵一拼。是故當局者應乘此千鈞一髮之時機。盡量啓發國民合羣之本能。集勞苦大衆爲國獻身之精力。立脚於對日鬭爭。對内整理。無論爲政治的經濟的。以至日當生活。皆當鑑於東北已往覆轍。勇往邁進。爭取最後之勝利。</p>

<p>我軍在新立屯附近之戰利品</p>
<p>日兵渡邊章彦日記一册、乃服務東北義軍之某君所寄贈、據云本月九日十日、新立屯附近我軍與日軍有激戰、日軍大濱、此册卽從渡邊章彦死體身上覓得者、</p>
<p>封皮爲黄色布質、正面印黑紅兩色鋸齒線、下有（　）字、零印（昭和七年軍隊日記）及（櫻　忠温監修）等字、底面有籃墨水笨所書（村井旅·團騎兵第二小隊四分隊渡邊章彦）字樣字頗汗漫、</p>
<p>日記起自昭和七年十二月十七日、止於八年月八日、共二十三日、合日記托頁上所書的共二十四　、記文雜用鉛筆藍墨水筆所書、鉛筆字漆草糢糊、頗難辨認、茲擇其字迹較明晰、意義較重大者、如日記册托頁上之文字及去年十二月二十三·二十六·本年一月五日之記事、譯錄如左、</p>
<p>綜觀渡邊之日記全文、其　惡兵役、長　怕　及不願與華人作戰之情、充滿於字裏行間、甚且諸責其政府之讀武政策、深感·生　乏味、其境可憫、其情可嘆、一渡邊如此、多數日兵想亦相同、於此吾人可得二義、</p>
<p>一·比年以年、日本國内武人專横、政治紊亂、經濟恐慌、思想激鑾、　者早知其危機四伏、的途堪　而日本軍隊仍不知省察、反窮兵讀武、加緊優略　邦、我國、冀以轉移其國民視綫、保持私人之地位、豈知彼所恃以侵略鄰國之軍隊、其思想亦巳大變、非復曩昔之一味盲從、甘作工其可　、苟我國人能誓死自衛、澈底抵抗、則日本人民之覺悟、可立而待、</p>

<p>日記托員上書之文字　　　們的敵人不最中國、滿洲之野、並不是我們的戰塲、我們的敵人、與其説是中國、莫若説是日本、日本國　　該從自尊心　覺悟起　、從人道道　覺悟　　、現在敵國支那、巳　由我們支　之下漸漸的變化了、也許變成比我們更　　的國民、爲什麽我們要與這樣的敵人去戰呢、</p>
<p>十二月二七日人夜、知道出動的事有確實性了、中隊幹部的忙碌、非言語所能形容、宿營院中已裝設了電燈、</p>
<p>十二月十八日準備出動、會商者甚多中有渡邊君、發表出征兵的姓名、我的姓名也在内、入衣發給被賬等類、</p>
<p>十二月十九日·被編成爲動員中隊、與馬别　正午、母親、仁志與四郎等來會、連涙都没流的母親的堅强心理使身受者竊喜、衣　爲要安慰留守者之心、反苦於對坐</p>
<p>十二月二十日奘　甚忙、一時起檢查軍裝、師團長及旅團長來訓諾、略謂（不久將成我們支配下的屬民、所以你們去殺了一個人、康該流些哀傷之　、諸　對於身體　係重）等　、並攝影以　臨别紀念、對軍旗御眞影作拜别敬禮、上林叔父來會、　以不要紀念著母親、提燈便有好幾組入營門來祝送、</p>
<p>十二月二十一日　午前一時半起床、三時半自　營地出發、愛馬精神很好、氣亦萬昻、五時半裝載完畢、向車站前進、八時出發、在瀨戸有籐原的母親及　君來送别、在岡山逢到家兄　忠、橘木先生等、三時半在宇品下車、</p>
<p>住了一夜、是宿於國土上的最後的一夜、睡也睡不着、過了一點鐘以後、才稍稍睡着、</p>
<p>十二月二十二日六時半、將馬匹裝於吳淞丸　　自己　　一步、　是别離日本陸地的一刹那、雖然没有流出涙來、總覺不大自在、三時開船、歡送的軍艇與我們的船並行着駛、對於他們喊（萬歲）的　音、想答亦答不出、傍人喊着萬歲的時候、惟　我是閉口無言、但是我很遺憾、我没有必定要死的决心、</p>
<p>十二月二十三日停泊於下關、最討厭的是碼頭上的商人、還以高價向將與故國死别的我們、　　他們的商品、甚至便我感覺到爲保護這此人們的國家、眞没有去死的必要、四時半、祖國的影子漸從我們眼稴簾喪失去了、夜裘海浪甚大、身心都覺不自如、</p>
<p>十二月二十四日過了十點鐘的時候、看見朝鮮半島了、發給防寒具、着在身上、像煞墅斯基毛人似的、有人還嘲笑、誰也想不到我們是這樣裝束、我穿上這種服裝、不勞動也會出汗、一入黄海、海水變成黄色、使人吃驚、人生像是很長似的、其實很短、在這短　期内、還有等待着開人類之花的、將來還不知道成就如何的偉大人物哩、</p>
<p>十二月二十五日衝破黄海的波浪、船巳漸趨安靜、望大連行駛、左弦將滿的月亮高懸碧空、像是在無言襄爲　儕前途祝福、在甲板上不穿防寒背心站着、覺得很寒冷氣候是如此差　、時間要比國　慢一點鐘、由此等事實推之、不得不預知這就是已經遠離故國、將　到達目的地點、十二月二十六日（抵大連）豋甲板、看白渡逐天、巧妙從島的中問濳進、將入大連商港、七時半、雖開始豋岸、而我站在小野一等兵的步哨那邊、心中感到人生乏味、嗣與中田事務長談話、並被飲以洒餚、始略得些人生意義、我想、交友無非止有此　　一點半起、　街游玩、爲盡覽大連名勝起見乘坐汽車游覽、好在敵影尙未見着十二月二十七日九時集合、與坊　同到（用度　）十二時離家、五時在大連市街及　頭等地、輿同胞們在　　趨游、夢　曾游祖國、</p>
<p>十二月二十八日（抵奉天）到　奉天是七時半　氣溫是零上十三度五分、也没有什麽受不了的事情、並將馬集合於奉天醫科太　的院裏、相起　愛馬嘴上蓓着冰鬚、身上塗着日霜、在露天北屬襄過了一夜、心衷生出一種異樣的心理、牽馬開拔、聽到五月來作戰的談話、也是纒綿悱惻的事、</p>
<p>十二月二十九日　昨日（西盛號）被隣人天村君　折　左腿、實是可憐、好容易養到二十歲、萬事皆成了、現在丢了一匹馬、一個人的騎兵隊、前進更不知如何了、</p>
<p>十二月三十日　七點半集合、八點半方全體　起來其情狀可知、乘　敎　、　　、憲風所侵、不斷的長鳴、嘴頭上的冰溜尾上的霜、誰能想念及此呢、從母親手襄　來的錢不翼而飛了、反正錢總歸會没有的、這也没有什麽大不了的意裝、算了罷、</p>
<p>十二月三十一日　方在睡深的四點時候起床、六時完了出發準備、向奉天車站前進、因昨夜被便衣隠所破壞的　路正在修理、故延長至午後一時向打虎山出發、説到大年底、連　飯　没得吃將校們都爲軍　發悉、向西北前進、五點　起、三列車　成不能前進之勢、十二時始得到遂打虎山車站、就　機在敵人之前停留着、我走馬棚値班、於　在滿洲之野、站着、　過　年、</p>
<p>一月一日睡的時候、和像要凍死似的那樣戰慄抵抗、臥在　橱裏、靜待天明六點鐘的時候、才吃到似是微發來的半熟的早餐、在打虎山下、向東　列中隊　隊、齊　　代之歌、立於敵人之前一作　種靜　的集合、不算代　　　　的事　　車站有二　　　的　　、　　　一具　　、　　中　三　、　　　有三　　　、巳　　成家　了、　　、亦　以　　昨日的戰門了、</p>
<p>一月二日　午　十時、佔領一所中國　　良民的大住　在　空了的房屋裏、　　了我們的身體、　舉的中國人很勸蓄的　我們勞動、實在使我們數　、（　　　）、但　是在嘴裏　吃看、也没有什麽　　、</p>
<p>一月三目　正午擠到旗　長的命令、知道黑山　有馬　　　、故卹刻思發、馳　於曠野之間、跟着矢野尾斥候作　道僨察中、覺見一列車、懇着民口口旗織和白旗、漸次接近面來、我即　回去報告、豈知來者是一美國親察嗣、將校們很緊張　持着槍、如　如風的豋上車去、而彼撃正在　宴用　、不覺浮氣而返、</p>
<p>一月四日　到達縣城、未見馬該、只見城外的電綫桿上、高縣着四個　　、　許是是馬該的頭、看去是並没有馬賊來襲的模嫌、本擬卽　、但以虚實不明、且家大狺吠、前找到一個大家院落還夜、以待天明、遂雄糾糾鞭策駒馬、馳　道上、毫無所獲而返、在途中曾用機關槍作試騐射撃、</p>
<p>一月五日　没有敵人、硬作假想敵人的演習、此中悲哀、有誰知道呢、如果有人知道的話、則將嘆息此種演習爲毫無意　的舉動、午前乘馬集合、在高打樸鄒（譯音）附近作戰門下馬、</p>
<p>一月六日　五時起床、向八道礦方面移動、吾們小隊、押着大行李、安步前進、有七里之路、今日北風甚　、手足寒冷、不由的生出眷懷故鄕之念、四時到達、有英國人支配的大發電所、其房屋内部布置的蔡然、殊　令人驚異、</p>
<p>一月七日　五時半起床、向新立屯前進、各種東西皆稀少、無足驚奇者、四時到達、進駐以前張學良的軍隊曾經住過的大房子裏、這樣我們不戰而得占　新天地、大和男子的氣象、向誰去値提誇張、</p>
<p>一月八日　今天是陸軍創立紀念日、在站前的大廣塲上、騎馬舉行分列式、中午吃的是中菜、喝的是日本酒、</p>

<p>各界均有沉痛表示</p>
<p>大中華公司昨播音</p>
<p>本市各界航空救國宣傳週昨爲第二日、原定由史量才姜懷素等播音演講、嗣史氏因事改期、姜仍如期至大中華公司播音、茲將演詞略誌於下、</p>
<p>姜懷素演講</p>
<p>關於航空救國宣傳週的意義、昨天吳市長巳經講過、各位大槪都巳明白、九一八事件發生以後、（杭日救國）可以説是全體民衆一致的主張、然而要有具體的計劃、方能見到效力、第一要審察事實眞相、目前中國的軍隊很多、同時精神亦很好、但是在國防上還没有相當的建設、（抗日救國）的工具、還没有積極的補充、只靠赤手空拳、和敵人去拼、結果一定是失敗的、所謂（抗日救國）的工具、其最重要的、當然要算是飛機了、吳市長説、（將來空軍是勝敗的主力）、這是很有意義的、去年一二八之役、雖然我們有忠勇的十九路軍和第五軍、犧牲着血和肉來保衛國土、但因缺乏空軍的援助、受到了重大的損失、試看閘北江灣一帶的一片焦土、我們應當何種的感想、一二八以後、大家都知道空軍的重要了、因爲中國科學落後、不能自造、而且中央財政困難、無力購買、因此空軍的力量、簡直無法充實、然而我們如果有這决心、對於中央應當盡力給予正當援助、經濟的援助、戰鬥飛機的種類、有偵察轟炸驅逐三種、每架平均價格約爲十五萬元左右、這價格看來似乎很大、然我們計算一二八損失的總數、是十五萬萬元、可以得到一萬架飛機、要是中國有一萬架的飛機、來建設空軍、充實國防、非但上海的一二八不會發生、也許東三省亦還在我們手中哩、世界空軍力量最大的法國、飛機在六千架以上、小小的日本、亦在二千架以上、惟有我們中國、還説不出個數目、很可痛心、現在我們旣有（抗日救國）一致的决心、就應盡我們的力量、來帮助政府建設空軍、要知（抗日救國）不祇是政府的一、亦是我們民衆的責任、（國家興亡匹夫有責）、　是這個意思、現在上海有航空協會的組織、入會費每人二元、把會費收入所得、完全購買戰鬥飛機、我們希望此次運動所得結果、自（一二八）號（上海）號以至（滬商）號（滬工）號等等繼續奮起、日前市敎育會已决集資捐助（滬校）第一號）一架、區區此數、尙不足以救國、深望富有資産者、大批捐助、最近期内、完成我們的使命、否則暴日再寇上海、我們那時恐怕連認捐的機會都要没有了）、</p>
<p>航空協會覓定會所</p>
<p>本月二十二日下午四時、中國航空協會爲擴大宣傳起見、在八仙橋靑年會招待各界、到中央監察委員吳稚暉等百餘人、由史量才主席、即席决議到會人員全體加入協會、現中國航空協會已覓定極司斐而路九十九號爲會所、積極進行佈置、并定於二月一日起遷入、正式辦公、并擴大微求會員、茲錄是日招待各界主席史量才及林我將吳稚暉薛篤弼褚民誼吳市長等演詞如下、</p>
<p>史量才致辭</p>
<p>略謂、本會今日邀請各界、開此茶話會、承各界人士惠然蒞臨、無任欣感、本會今日召集此會之意義、則以航空救國、巳爲今日刻不容緩之國、但航空應如何計劃、如何發展、始可達到救國之目的、則有待於集思廣益共同討論、切望今日到會諸君、各抒所見、用資指導、吾人加憶（一二八）日人飛機轟炸之慘、猶覺憤慨、以後吾人應以航空爲第二生命、急起直追、期以有保障吾人之生命財産、使彼强暴者無所施其技、本會成立伊始、當務之急、則在如何籌欵以購買飛機、希望各界踴躍匡襄、至購得飛機之後、應作何用途、始可貫澈吾人之本旨、亦非常重要、本來吾人所以不恤勢神費財、以謀航空之發展者、其目的在鞏固國防、如以吾人竭力經營得來之飛機、恐有作對内之用、此乃過慮之意、其實國難日急、稍有人心者、當努力以救國、絶無所謂對内、祇有一致對外、不爲國民之罪人、此爲本會應嚴重申明注意者、現在吳市長已極力倡導、使市府全體職員、下至警士以及保安隊兵士、同時加入本會、希望今日到會諸君、亦皆加入本會、并隨時隨地、分向各界宣傳、使人民明瞭航空之重要、共同加入本會努力、本會前途、實利賴之、至本會成立經過、現請林我將先生向各位報告、</p>
<p>林我將報告</p>
<p>略謂、自（九一八）瀋陽事變以來、及（一二八）淞滬戰事之後、國人均覺空防之重要、各地黨部及地方團體以及海外僑胞、紛紛向國民政府呈遞請求書、請求組織航空救國會、使民衆共同努力、以救國難、國府將此類報告書發交軍政部、轉令航空署、歸納各方意見、擬具辦法、嗣由航空署派我將來滬、輿各界領袖接洽、當經各領袖熱烈贊成、於是開始航空救國會之籌備、旋蒙國民政府聘王曉籟先生等二十二人爲本會理事、并承吳市長極力襄贊、本會遂於本月一日正式成立又以航空國防、須持之恒久、救國會之名義、有臨時應付之意、似不妥治、經政府將此意委吳市長　各籌備員磋商、遂改定名爲（中國航空協會）、此本會成立經過之大槪情形也、</p>
<p>吳稚暉演講</p>
<p>剛纔聽史量才先生演講、使我非常感觸、我國自甲午一役、給日本敎訓一下、即有救國的口號、差不多近四十年了、上年一二八我們又受到敎訓了、有人説、人與人爭、先要把人與物争這層爭過、方能人與人爭、我從前説馬達救國、航空就是用馬達的、現在中國航空協會成立的宗旨、同我的馬達救國主義一樣、所以我非常贊成的、總要使人人腦筋裏有馬達思想、才能彀喜歡研究、人才也多了、科學也昌明了、切不可説我是外行、就不理會、要知凡事總是外行成爲内行的、人人都成了内行、然後方可人與人爭、决不能抱着不抵抗主義、再把人家來敎訓、這是來不及了、我國四萬萬人若講到募集、眞如九牛一毛、但是有人説、人民貧苦已極、好像負担不起、可知牛是瘦了、這一毛容易拔的、所以我勸國人、先要把這思想變換、趕快培植人才、大家利用馬達救國主義、這就是發展航空救國了、</p>
<p>薛篤弼致詞</p>
<p>略謂、貴會名爲航空協會、僅願就（協）字言之、吾國有一諺語云、（一木難支大厦、）又諺語、（衆志誠城、）前者即云獨持則勢微、後者乃言衆　即易舉、吾國數十年來、日被侵凌、即由於萬衆萬心、而不能合力協濟之故、今見貴會成立、係由於政府與民衆團體合力促成、由此足證朝野均有最大之覺悟、澈底了解、同心禦侮之必要矣、今後但願由此一字之誠、以打破吾國當頭之危局、</p>
<p>褚民誼演説</p>
<p>方纔吳稚暉先生演説中國航空協會集欵的辦法、是很容易的、但是總要有一個集中的辦法、或是每團體捐一機、成個人損一機、全國趕緊設立分會、一致進行各人分頭微求、多多</p>
<h2>Page 12</h2>
<p>益善、自然能夠達到我們所希望的程度、這航空救國、就可以實行了、</p>
<p>吳鐵城演講</p>
<p>剛才吳稚暉先生説過、（我國在甲午受日本重創後、國人即發出救國口號、一但迄今將近四十年、國仍不救、且危險益甚、前年九一八横逆之來、竟至無法抵杭、可勝痛心、要知救國須重實際、决非如以前虚文空話所能見效、設仍如是、則雖至吳先生年躋期頣、仍聽一輩子亂　救國、究於救國之實際有何絲毫裨　、當今救國之實際工作、厥惟建設國防、無論各界民衆士農工商、都應痛下决心、都以建設國防的中心事業、倘能努力進行、則五年十年後、自有成效可觀、否則以個人觀念爲中心、决無效力、藉曰有之於國家有何益處、去年滬上一二八之創鉅痛深、實非任何人事前夢想所及、於此可見防空之如何重要、目今空軍、成力之大、當推法國爲最、法人會有數句鐘　竟數分鐘内可以炸燬倫敦全市之豪語、以前對待陸軍有坦克車、對待海軍有潛水艇等、現在殺人利器、愈形厲害、有了空軍轟炸以後、非得有防空設備不可、我人旣受九一八及一二八嚴重敎訓之後、應當澈底覺悟、以建設國防爲一切事業之中心、但茲事體大、須由全國人民、協力同心做去、才能成功、兄弟有鑒於此、所以巳勸令本府全體職員及保安隊警士等數千人、一體加入航空協會、以爲　率、上海全市約計有三百萬人、即以每人年納普通會費二元計、每年就有六百萬元之收入、可購買或制造飛機數十架了、俄法日各國之國防、均靠人民自動建設、我國倘欲抗日救亡、何獨不然、所以我希望全上海市民、一體加入航空協會、推而至於全省全國、都能如是、那未我們國防自有辦法、不患無復讐雪恥之日全</p>

<p>租與雙琴居住　　其自己則閒時一來、嗣後被告卽與其妻之外甥女同出同歸、關係不明、人言嘖嘖、對雙琴日便疏冷、至本年七月間、被告所有國富門路一百三十號出租之屋、因租期届滿、由雙琴搬入、被告竟由疏冷而入於棄置不顧、迨雙琴親赴其宅探問、始猶周旋、後竟不理、投函相訽、亦置不答、經雙琴委律師去函詰問、被告乃委其友牛門面託俞素畦女士、向雙琴調解、願給三千元、解除關係、當經雙琴答以受驅失身、豈金錢所能了事、惟念</p>
<p>雙琴良家閨女　　素承家敎、不幸家與被告爲鄰、竟受其騙、始亂終棄、事實昭彰、雙琴恨之切骨、泣訴無門、乃被告實犯刑法第二五七條第一項之和誘罪及第三一零條第一項之遺棄罪、請求依法論罪云云、嗣經法院傳達被告、被告延裘汾齡律師提出答辯云、查刑法二五七條和誘略誘之搆成、以和誘未滿二十歲之男女脱離享有親權人之監護人或保佑人爲要件、按自訴人嚴雙琴、現年二十五歲、據自訴人狀稱、至民國十九年始相與</p>
<p>同居於棘斐坊　　云云、是雙琴當時年巳二十、自不能適用前條之規定、已有十七年解字第二二四號解釋例解釋於前、至於本案事係雙琴勾引被告、而非被告略誘雙琴、彼時雙琴與被告同居於同里、一則爲小家之女、浪漫成性、一則係世家之子、書生本色、雙琴羨被告翩翩多金、始則目送神移、來相勾引、繼復親筆來信、約地求晤、情緻纒綿、不堪卒讀、</p>
<p>被告正値靑年　　終被顚倒、來函猶在、豈容諱飾、（來函有十一封之多）况辣斐德路房屋、係雙琴託其姊夫鄭士樊（現因綁架浦文汀等案業已判處無期徒刑）、代爲租賃、故民對於該屋地址、初尙不知詳細、有雙琴來函可證、則所謂脱離享有親權之人云云、更屬不能成立、今雙琴對於被告旣從未取得家屬身份、被告</p>
<p>即無贍養義務　　惟被告宅心仁厚、亦曾陸續給予金錢、有何遺棄之可言、且雙琴年纔二十五歲、旣非老幼、又無殘疾、刑法上之遺棄責任、更難成立、總之自訴人等砌詞誣訴、誠屬别具用心云云、此案昨日下午四時、經王綱煦庭長在刑一庭審理、先向自訴人等詢問一過、詰之被告供、年三十六歲、民人與自訴人相識、實於民國十九年間、並非六年前相識、所有租房屋、實由雙琴自己託姊夫去租賃、今年七月間、雙琴未徵民人同意、擅自遷入國富門路、惟民人與雙琴</p>
<p>感情并未喪失　　爲因其親戚有犯綁票案、經民人勸其脱離不肯、故此疏冷、但民人於二月之間、尙給其用費一千數百元、并無不顧贍養云、自訴人代理律師則稱、被告與雙琴相姦、實有六年之久、今有被告親筆字據、并有其朋友牛門及俞素畦女士可證、繼由證人俞女士素畦上堂、證明被告曾託牛門向吾説明雙方相識六年之言、嚴雙琴稱、辣斐坊房屋、實由被告給我一千元呌我去租的、訊至此、時已下午六點半矣、王庭長諭被告交隨傳隨到保、着雙方出外試行和解、改期再訊、</p>

<p>｜沈亦民君來函｜</p>
<p>朱嬰先生答復我上次討論生産合理化的函件，（見一月二十三日本欄）根本上並没有什麽不</p>
<p>同，朱先生所説的生産合理化，自然是指現社會卽資本主義社會的生産合理化，牠「的結果」自然「使你一天精疲力盡而得不著一飽，」「這句話」云「可以成立」，是不成問題，我並没有反對。我所以爲朱先生更進一解者，因爲有些人，尤其是一些勞動者,往往因爲身受資本主義生産合理化的痛苦、便對於生産合理化本身的價値深惡而痛絶之，遂不暇思索生産合理化這種經騐對於將來社會主義的經濟組織有什麽意義。因就朱先生大文而推廣之，非盡對於朱先生之言根本上有所不滿也。再者朱先生今日所言，在我看來，也還有商量之處：（一）朱先生説：「沈君説話的根據，便是「蘇聯的計劃經濟，也就是透露此一端倪，」換句話説，便是蘇聯的經濟組織，也是實行「生産合理化。」」實則朱先生有點誤會，我只説「蘇聯的計劃經濟，便是透露此一端倪，」並没説蘇聯已經實行了「生産合理化。」（二）朱先生説：「不論在聯蘇似乎還没有　到這個名詞，就令將來眞呌做「生産合理化，」然資本主義的自由平等與社會主義的自由平等，是截然兩樣的。）對呀，是截然兩樣的。但是這個「截然兩樣，」不是在生産合理化的機構，而是在牠的社會關係，換句話説，就是在社會主義的生産合理化的目的與運用生産合理化的主體以及牠的運用的範圍。我在前信中説得很明白：「…在這種社會中（卽社會主義的社會中。亦民）生産已經不是爲商品而生産，乃是爲生産者自身的消費而生産，」而申報讀者顧問的編輯先生在答語中説得更明顯：（……生産合理化本是商品生産社會的生産方法的最高表現，但是這一最高的生産方法到了一定程度，便與牠所從來的生産關係不相容，結果牠就替這一生産關係所形成的社會組織掘下了墳墓，「諸君入囊，便從他的母胎囊破框而出，做了更高階段的社會組織的「寗馨兒。」」因此，我敢説一句，蘇聯的「五年計劃）的内容，便是資本主義社會之生産合理化的經騐與技術的（更高的表現，）雖然牠没有標明生産合理化的名詞，雖然牠還没有把牠的内容十分充實的表現出來。至於（名詞）倒是次要的問題。一個新建立的開社會主義道途上走的國家。無處不要利用並學習資産階級國家的可賢貴的經騐與技術並且要全盤承　他的偉大的遺産。譬如，美國的杜威和哈烈Ｈall等等的德模克拉西的敎育學及敎授法、在資本主義的美國的社會中是一個意義，但是一被蘇聯所採用，則完全成爲另一意義，也未聞有人以蘇聯未曾標明德模克拉西的敎育而遂否認蘇聯曾經採取美國的敎育方法。一個唯物論辨證法的研究者應當在具體的問題上去追求，不應徒追求其（名詞）之有無也。因朱先生一信，我又率爾妄發議論，幸朱先生及讀者恕其狂愚而有以敎之、（一月二十三日夜）</p>

<p>昨晚上海籃球會四組比賽、興趣集中於靑年健華之戰、健華一路佔先、頗爲順利、不料靑年之能後來居上、反敗爲勝也、華東夏光、陣容不固、頗少精神、觀者寥寥、不免大爲減色、今晚比賽仍四塲、甲組爲鷹隊對眞茹、鷹隊旣有林澤羣孔廣益等名將、實力自有可觀、日前與華東一戰、已窺鋒芒、眞茹卽曁南大學、其球藝早爲一般人所賞議、是以今晚會師、當可有良好表演、今晚秩序如下、</p>

<h3 id="c171">從鐵鳥説到麻雀 <a href="#c171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>— 瞻廬</p>
<p>誰都知道撲天雕似的轟炸機，是世間最可怖的東西，這一兩年内的同胞犧牲於敵人鐵鳥下的生命財産，倘使一一的總計起來，可算得驚人紀錄，可算得永遠深刻着的創痕。</p>
<p>鐵鳥固然可怖，麻雀的可怖也不在鐵鳥之下！昔人説的：「三鳥害人鴉鴇雀」，其實鴉片的害，老鴇的害，都不是普徧的，三害之中只有麻雀的爲害最大！論它爲害的程度，非但超過了鴉鴇二鳥，而且，超過了號稱鐵鳥的轟炸機！只爲，鐵鳥爲害在特殊情形之下，麻雀爲害在普徧情形之下，犧牲於鐵鳥下的生命財産是偶然的犧牲於麻雀下的生命財産是常然的；你們瞧吧！普通家庭中要覓一册本國地圖，這是十家九不有的；惟有麻雀牌却是家庭常備軍！你們聽吧！普通社會中講幾句喚醒痴頑的言論，這是難得聽聞的；普通社會中講幾句有聲有色的麻雀賭經，無論街頭，巷尾，茶坊，酒肆，處處都可以聽得！</p>
<p>有人説：麻雀牌不是曾經輸運出口，盛行於新大陸麽。可見外國人也愛玩這東西，何必專責本國人呢？其實不然，美國人玩麻雀，並非賭博性質，祇不過當做團體游戲的一種。每逢宴會時，按照來賓人數組成麻雀戲若干局，打過一次以後，延請各局中的勝利者合成一局或多局，再作複選式的比賽以决勝負，凡是第一次落伍的人祇可作壁上觀而不許再爲馮婦；如是這般的由勝利者繼續决賽，最後必有奪得錦標的一人，專角心思而不賭物質，這是多麽的高尙咧！</p>
<p>世人只知道「橘逾淮而化枳」，不知道「枳逾淮而也化爲橘」；麻雀並非高尙的游戲，飛到了美洲，便會高尙起來；這不是枳逾淮而化橘麽？</p>
<h3 id="c172">鴉片趣劇 <a href="#c172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>— 羅村人</p>
<p>｜公賣以後的事實｜</p>
<p>假使鴉片是個宗敎，再把其餘敎的信徒，來和鴉片敎的信徒比一比，我想世界上的大宗敎，也要到我們中華的這鴉片敎了，你看宣敎師和信敎徒如此之多啊！且拿我的家鄕説，居民不過四五十家，而烟館即有四五家之多，我親眼看到這樣的事實：</p>
<p>丈夫像失去靈魂似的，對他的妻子喊道：「你把我剛買的鴉片藏到甚麽地方去了，快拿來吧！」妻子乞憐地回：「留給我過癮吧，我幾天没吃了。」</p>
<p>這時他們的一個貧血的四歲男孩，已餓得不能彈動了，他做手勢，敎他的母親捧泥土到鍋裏煮飯吃。</p>
<p>隔壁的窮叔子，聽到他的姪兒姪媳吵嘴，過來大駡一頓，並把烟具，烟土婦一槪搜去，以示懲戒。</p>
<p>叔叔把姪兒子烟土，拿家來閉門獨抽，原來他也是個没錢買土的老鬼子呀。唉！鴉片敎的中國！</p>
<h3 id="c173">歌謠與兒童 <a href="#c173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>— 中言</p>
<p>｜告爲人父母者｜</p>
<p>好的歌謠能於無形中將兒童的性情改善，不好的歌謠也能於無形中將兒童的性情改惡；歌謠對於兒童的關係非常重大，所以爲人父母者對於能和兒童接觸的歌謠，不得不加以選擇和改正。</p>
<p>好的歌謠固然很多，不好的却也不少。在敝縣（山東福山）有一個最盛行的歌謠：</p>
<p>小胖孩，上窗臺，偷他爹（一）的小洋　　錢；他爹打，他媽拉（二）。</p>
<p>一個兒童若從幼就習唱這類的歌謠，腦中便得了一個偷的印象，將來還能成個良善的國民嗎？像這類的歌謠恐怕各地都有幾隻，所以我奉勸爲人父母者千萬不要忽視了它。</p>

<p>— 天方</p>
<p>在我所居的鄰近，有一所古廟，裏面住着幾個苦修的和尙。每天淸早，「閣閣」的木魚聲，很有節奏地傳到你枕上，常使我帶着悲憫的情緒去想像他們的生活。這些可憐的自私者，全上了印度黑炭的當，滿懷着成仙成佛，白日飛昇的願望，却還累贅着一副臭皮囊，需要人間物質的供養。到頭來，兩眼一閉，一坯黄土，成仙成佛且由他去命名，生命的結束，還不是和常人一樣。「學佛」與「等死」，究竟有何分别？若説是祈生西天樂土，但假如他知道他所企求的「天竺」，就是紅頭阿三的故鄕，那蜜蜂的針</p>
<p>九門口大戰，北平的大學校的校花們，兀是在溜冰滑雪，幹伊們及時的樂事。伊們的行爲，恐怕比了唱後庭花的商女，還有些比不上。</p>
<p>要人的狗失踪了，要豋報招尋；日本的狗被戝了，要開會追悼；以前外國公園，係（華人與狗），同等待過的，現在看來，却有些人不如狗了。</p>
<p>法租界的顧家花園，租界當局是呌做（顧家花園），然而上海人民却衆口同聲，呌他做（法國公園）。眞和呌英租界的大英地界，一般的使初到上海的人；感到剌耳！（殺羽）</p>
<p>（二爺回來了），紅葉的阿姪，在門口站着。</p>
<p>紅葉來不及回答，急急往裏走。跨上堂沿，父親躺在堂前籐榻上。瘦削的兩頰，一頭長亂的白髮，長久不修剪，愈顯憔悴，没有穿襪，兩脚彷彿腫得要裂開來，手背和兩腮，也都浮腫。見紅葉進來現出一絲笑容。</p>
<p>（啊！紅葉回來看我了）！</p>
<p>（爹·····）</p>
<p>喉嚨口鎖住了，説不出第二句話。母親哥哥，引他到房裏，低低告訴他城裏的郎中，已經没有辦法了。昨天有人舉薦Ｘ醫生，他是Ｙ縣很紅的醫生，來Ｃ城出診一趙，要一百塊錢。非大面子介紹，還不一定肯出來。今天烏天亮，就派長年拿了間壁張老伯的片了，搭長途汽車去請，不曉得肯不肯賞光？</p>
<p>紅葉又知道父親自從回家，差不多Ｃ鄕的名醫，一個個都輪流請敎過，每一個醫生的處女方吃下去，照例是夜眠較安，浮腫略减。可是三四帖藥一吃，又恢復原狀。Ｃ鄕的名醫，很具君子風。自巳看不好的病，便薦賢以自代。甲薦於乙，乙薦於丙。最後的一位儒醫，實在薦不出不曾看過父親的病的醫生來了，便太息　蹙，握着紅葉哥哥的手，戚然若有割股之意。（尊公的病，心血巳枯，恐非人力所能挽回。老夫今晚替你們恭請佛祖降壇，判示吉凶，你自已來壇前叩問）。</p>
<p>紅葉的哥哥，戰戰兢兢，爬在壇前，磕了三個頭。壇諭是（祿命已盡）四個字。那一位儒醫，便不辦交代而絶跡不至。</p>
<p>吃中飯的時候，父親仍躺在籐榻上，忽然指指桌上的烤蝦；（這裏的魚蝦，是外頭所吃不到的，紅葉，可以多吃一些）。　　二十年依依嚴父膝下的紅葉，可算從不曾聽過這類慈母的口吻。如雪亮的銀針，剌入心窩深處！除（啊）了一聲外，再也吃不下飯。腦海裏旋風般轉着Ｃ鄕的信條：</p>
<p>（生病的人，切忌改變脾氣）。</p>
<p>三名轎夫，吆吆喝喝，居然把Ｙ縣的大紅大紫的Ｘ醫生招來了。紅葉隨着哥哥，衣冠整肅，迎入書房。原來是個蹺脚黑鬍鬚的矮子。望問切脈之後，提起筆，　　　一口氣開了七張八行花箋的脈案。眞是倚馬萬言，若有宿慧。</p>
<p>（阿彌陀佛！這郎中一定是你父親的救星了！那裏聽見過開方子開七八張信紙）？母親聽了紅葉不斷地一張一張往上加的報告。直寫到第十一張半上，才是樂味，第一味是蛤蜊一對。</p>
<p>（這蛤蜊，恐怕這裏小藥店裏配不出，你們要上日城去買）。（四）</p>

<p>— 林亨</p>
<p>風是尖刀般的快，雪是鵝毛般的大，窮人們胃寒奔波，富人們　鑪賞雪，</p>
<p>富人們坐在裝着熱水汀的洋房裏，溫暖如春，隔着玻璃窗望望雪景，多寫意，多有趣！出來的時候，皮袍外面，再加上皮大衣，坐的是轎式汽車，西北風休想吹動他的一根毫髮！</p>
<p>我不是富人，當然没有住洋房坐汽車的資格。一條長得望不見底的霞飛路上，行人是晨星般的稀少。我立在畢勛路口，冒着風雪，等了一刻多鐘，纔有一輛自西徂東的電車經過，我不敢怠慢，一等車停。便跳上三等車廂，車中人很少，極容易找到座位，我剛坐定，忽聽有人喊道：（老林！你到那兒去？）我定睛一看，原來是有電影迷的。同學陳君。便答道：）我到華龍路朋友家裏去，你此刻到那兒去？）陳君道：（看電影去。）我道：現在東北義勇軍冒雪抗日，你到有興致冒雪觀影？）陳君道：（你别挖苦我，電影雖然是一種娛樂，可是有意義的電影，很有益於社會敎育，像（東北二女子）的抛撇私情，同赴國難。（孽海雙鴛）的打破遺産制，提倡富人以財産舉辦公益。如果我國同胞，人人能像（東北二女子）中的兩位女了，（孽海雙鴛）中的那位富翁，恐怕東北義勇軍，早已把失地收回了。）我道：好了，好了！總算你看電影的有理由，但是像我没錢看電影的，又怎麽呢？）這時電車已到了華龍路站，我便和陳君説聲：（再見）！忽忽下車。</p>
<h3 id="c176">關於西洋歌劇 <a href="#c176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>自家不甚懂得西洋歌劇。但那些著名的古劇本，倒大槪談過或知道的。可是在上海，縱然算是東方的巴黎，却不易瞧見太平洋西岸的歌劇，開展在舞台上。實在，中國民衆根本就不需要這些藝術，並且也未必瞭解這些藝術；就是旅行在中國的西洋人，大部份是大肚皮的洋行賣辦，或敎會裏的牧師，未必就眞正懂得哥行的（情　）。費爾地譜樂的（茶花女）·而且偶然上海公演西洋歌劇，也只是周遊世界的意大利劇團，演一兩星期便走了。他們用着意大利語言，唱着道白和詩，不要説中國人容易懂，單單以英譯本來解釋的英法國人，也同樣不能獲取劇中内在的豐富的情調。····就是十足的意大利人，也很少有會心的知音的。</p>
<p>然而，幾天來卡爾豋戲院正唱演着（杉卡羅劇團）的世界名劇，不因爲以上的緣故，使戲院子（門可羅雀），反而生意鼎盛，大有（滿座知音）之槪。在那裏，各國各民族的人都有，從舉動和服裝上可以看得出來；連中國男女也不少。｜决不諱言，我也跟着音樂師胡景熙氏去鑒賞過百年前Ｍurger著的ＬaＢoheme（音譯爲婆漢迷，是説浪漫的或流浪的藝術家的意思·）</p>
<p>那只是一個情節簡單的關於藝術家在貧窮生活襄慘戀的一幕悲劇。分四幕：㈠一八三○年時之巴黎㈡巴黎的瑪瑪酒館㈢巴黎城門，㈣和第一幕同。在這喪，正像不曾習練過京戲的江南人，聽聲調陌生的梅蘭芳的快板戲一樣，我並不瞭解意大利語言。但從他們的聲浪，舉動，表情看來，我正像看影戲一樣的明晰，尤其因陪奏的音樂給人以不少暗示，我能很舒服地體會着曾經讀過的婆漢迷的劇本。（淘）</p>
<p>麽他定不願生到印度去做亡國奴的後代了。放着一切，且不管他仙佛的有無，就算他白日飛昇，湼槃常住，不是荒誕的故事，但從（生）到（湼槃）（羽化），凡去到仙佛的過程中間，不能不需要人間世的供養。待到（功行圓滿），成仙成佛去了，却父母不識，六親不認，更不要説是衣食我的農工，敎誨我的師友，這呌做（公修得，婆修婆得），　情盡棄，豈不是社會上一個絶大的捲逃者嗎？幸而我佛不靈，並没有人人上當。到今天，人類這一族，還是林林總總，衣食無虞，世界還没有被野獸佔去。否則，（人類）這一名詞，豈不是早已滅絶了嗎？</p>

<p>— 無畏</p>
<p>那天在南貨店裏聽到了這一句：（要吃魷魚不要問）的話後，我回味着（不要問）三字，覺得這三字是處世藝術的一種。</p>
<p>（不要問）就是（不要管閒事）的意思，確然，不痴不聾不作阿翁，在這樣的年頭兒還是多吃飯少開口爲妙。。</p>
<p>所謂ＸＸ團等，現在是冰消瓦解了，但·不久以前這類的團體，不是東也在警告好商，西也擲炸彈麽？但是奸商依舊在進貨，長江一帶敵貨進口還是在激增，而幹這事的熱血靑年早身罹法網，所以熱血靑年們，還是儘量壓制你們底熱血吧！抱着。（不聞不問）的主義是最逍遙自。，憂國傷時的纔是傻子呢　　總之祗吃飯不開口不聞不問無論日人打到熱河也好，打到平津也好，即打到南京也是不管，人家問你爲什麽無動於中，你儘管這樣回答好啦，我們有政府存在着。，政府還泰然的在信仰着國聯。，要我們小百姓管什麽閒事。，皇帝不急倒急煞太監。。</p>
<p>最近監察委員Ｘ彈劾某某二人，於是引起了什麽責問等。，眞是無事尋煩惱。，大槪Ｘ委員不懺這處世的藝術吧。？</p>
<p>况且凡事你要仔細地問起來，眞是煩不勝煩，一件暗殺案，也許就有着許多背景，祗是你瞞着我，我瞞着你，要是不識相，你去問管閒事，準討一個没趣。。</p>
<p>譬如到洋貨店去買布，祇要價廉物美就買。，要是你詳細地問起來。，所得的結果未見得完滿。，反而碰到一個頂子（我們非國貨不賣的）也許你看見了伙計的尶𡯓面孔。，天良發現，那麽便宜貨便買不成了。</p>
<p>所以總而言之開宗明義的第一句話，就是（不要問　）朋友！這一種處世藝術你願意學嗎？不過我寫雖寫，但，希望一個也不願學這一種藝術，那纔不背我的眞意。</p>

<h3 id="c196">人造橡皮之製法 <a href="#c196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>— 爾明</p>
<p>橡皮之爲用，今之人無有不知之者，蓋因橡皮具有一種軟而不易致壞之特質，故吾人日常用品之中以橡皮製者頗不少見，惟此項製品需要橡皮之景甚微，天産这橡皮已足供應用，迨汽車之製出，其車輪皆以橡皮，由是橡皮之需要陸增，天産之不足以供人用，遂有一般科學家起而研究人造橡皮，以補天産之不足而應人類之需求，現人造橡皮盛行於世，惟其製造之法·恐知之者甚鮮，故將其重要者述於下，以資普及，有心研究者尙望另查製造專書，以明其中幽遂。</p>
<p>欲使人造橡皮得與天然橡皮競爭。</p>
<p>必所製出人造橡皮之價値較賤於天然橡皮，而且其質地與之相等或有以勝之，凡諸種種問題之解决，必以研究製造人造橡皮之原料着手，今限於篇幅，恕不能述及。</p>
<p>製造人造橡皮之最要原料爲Ｉsoprene，然與此相類之碳氧化合物如四碳雙烯Ｂutadiene等亦可用之，製造人造橡皮之法不外重合Ｉsoprene而已，其法不過將Ｉsopene或其他原料置於閉封之皿中，溫至相當之時間，即可成橡皮，溫度之高低則當視所用之原料而異也。</p>
<p>㈠用石油精（ＰetroleumＳpirit）製造取適量石油精（石油精含五碳烷Ｐentanes使與氧氣化合成氯化五碳烷基（ＰntylＣhloride），將氯化五碳烷基再與已炙之石灰接觸，取去氯化氫，再將所得之碳氫化合物五碳烯（Ａmylene）與氯化氧混和，此中經過之化學作用僅一個參一碳烷基二碳烯（Ｔrimethylethylene）分出，則變爲２一碳烷基２氯化四碳烷（２Ｍethyl2Ｃhlorobutane），若再以　氯化之，則得２一碳烷基２，４雙氧化四碳烷（２Ｍ）與２一碳烷基２，３雙氯代四碳烷（２Ｍethyl２，３dichlorobutane），將最後所得之兩化合物加鹼石灰則得Ｉsoprene。</p>
<p>㈡用澱粉製造其法先以澱粉溶於沸水中使膠發Ｇelatinize，然後使其發酵，成正四碳醇（ＭormalＢutylalcohol）與三碳酮（Ａcetone）之混合物，再將此混合物用蒸溜法分去三碳酮，取正四碳醇加氯化氧使變　化四碳烷（Ｂutylchloride），再加氯氧變爲３，４雙　代四</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>碳烷（１，４dichlorobutane），其沸點極低，設使之經過於燒紅之鹼石灰上則立即變爲四碳雙烯，四碳雙烯極易化氣，故必冷之使成液體，其法即以凝固之二氧化碳與醚（ether）包護凝結器之外也，四碳雙烯旣得則以氯化一碳基（Ｍethylchliride）使與化合而Ｉsoprene成矣，由此法所得之橡皮雖不能與天然橡皮無稍差異，然其質實有勝之者。</p>
<p>（三）用煤製造將煤與石灰置電爐中燒之，則得碳化鈣，碳化鈣加水二碳炔（ＡcetyleneＩ）氣立即放出，若再將二碳炔與水化合以高汞化氮（ＭercuricＣhloride）爲加速某，可成二碳醛（Ａcetaldehyde），氧化之則變醋酸，醋與　基化鈉（Ｓoanride）起化學作用可以使變爲三碳酮化鈉（ＳodiumＡceone），加二碳炔氣於三碳酮化銅可得一碳烷基四碳炔醇（Ｍetfylbutiol），由一碳烷基四碳炔醇再變爲一碳烷基四碳烯（Ｍethylbutenol），將此最後所得之一碳烷基四碳烯醇與硫酸鎂（ＭagnesiumＳulfate）接觸可盛sopeneo</p>
<p>㈣用木屑製造即將木屑乾蒸溜之取得其中所含之三碳酮，然後用鍋憑原之使變成鋁鹽與ＩsoＰroＰenol，水化之得鋁與Ｐinacol，將Ｐinacol取去二個水分子可以得雙一碳烷基四碳雙烯（ＤimethylＢutadiene），重合雙一碳烷基四碳雙烯即得橡皮，以蕃薯發酵而製三碳酮亦嘗採用焉。</p>
<p>ＭethylrubberＷ之製造，乃將液體之雙一碳烷基四碳雙烯置於雙壁皿中，升溫度至攝氏七十度，如此經過五個月後，皿中所含之雙一碳烷基四碳雙烯則變爲一種固質靑黄色之橡皮，Ｗ爲德文Ｗeich之簡寫，其意爲軟，蓋此種人造橡皮適合於製造軟質之器具也。</p>
<p>ＭethylrubberＨ以其質硬故名，其製法亦不外將雙一碳烯基四碳雙烯貯於薄壁之錫皿中，然後升溫度至攝氏三十度，經過三個月之時間，而白色多孔之凝結體成矣，此種橡皮逈異天然橡皮然其用則甚大也。</p>

<p>—</p>
<p>一喂！老張！後操塲全凍了冰了、我們到雪地上打球去，）素來不愛打球的老陳　今天怎然高興起來，他一面自動地剥下絲綿袍，一面喚着隔壁坐在書桌　　備化學　老張，</p>
<p>（好的，横豎明天没有考試）</p>
<p>他們興冲冲地來到後操塲，見老程老檀等在那裏巳打得很起勁，</p>
<p>（哦！眞吃不消，我巳滑了五六交了），老檀一見他們來，首先張開他那狗嘴汪汪的亂呌起來，原來老檀的綽號呌做阿黄，</p>
<p>（我想不打球也好，但是玩什麽呢？滑永又没有鞋子，）老陳改變了他的初衷，</p>
<p>其時老張發現了一件東西，便狂喊起來：那東西是一張破壞的書桌，横倒着臥在雪地上，</p>
<p>（來啊！推雪車吧，多年不玩這玩意兒了，）</p>
<p>（好的）老程連忙趕到樓上宿舍間，取了縛行李的繩子來，</p>
<p>大家分功合作，終於雪車推成了，　　（多麽有趣啊！一文不化狠坦然的坐雪車，）這是五分鐘後，老陳坐在車上説的，同時老程在前面用繩背着，老張和老檀在後面推，還有另外幾個同學在旁邊嘻笑着，</p>
<p>但是樂極總要生悲的，討厭的訓育員來了，</p>
<p>（喂！你們爲什麽要破壞公物？）訓育員走過來，拉着繩子，硬要呌他們同到訓育處去，</p>
<p>（你説什麽？桌子本來是壞的，）老陳見受了寃屈，首先從桌子上跳下來和訓育員交涉，</p>
<p>（你爲什麽要拉我的繩子這又不是校中的　老程向來是</p>
<p>（我要你們到訓育處去），訓育員也不肯示弱，</p>
<p>（賠你的桌子好了，幾塊錢？算在我們的賬上，豎我們每人有二元的賠償準備金，）老檀也怒了，</p>
<p>（到訓育處去？就跟你去，）老張説的，</p>
<p>（我要你放下繩子），老程使出如牛的氣力，將繩子從訓育員手中奪下，</p>
<p>（你們敢打人嗎）？訓育員簡直弄得無可奈何，而説出這句硬撑塲面的話，　　（我們要打你？到訓育處去好了，）反是老張要去，</p>
<p>到了訓育處，訓育主任因着他們是班次狠高的學生，記過是狠難爲情的，結果訓了一番，四個人公賠桌子，共是大洋六元，</p>
<p>放寒假了，每人接着一封警告書，他們笑着説：這是推雪車所得到的酬報呀，）天不怕地不怕的一個，至此怒髮冲冠了，</p>

<p>（這里滿淸爽，請坐。）在ＸＸ劇場裏的富有交際手腕的女招待汪，眼見兩個年輕游客興步走近始來，她忙的招呼。</p>
<p>（兩位先生坐下吧！）她的話語停了，接着那靈活的眼波梭射着他們一眼，并顯出得意的微笑。她更用着柔和的手指輕輕在他們肩膀上一推，送下椅裏。向抱享樂主義的陸，這時便順勢的滑在椅上；情不自禁的也格格的粗聲大笑。　　（茶？紅茶，綠茶，還是菊花茶？）　　（什麽的茶都勿要。）莊因爲曾經在游戲場裏吃過一次虧，他知道這塲所敲竹槓的事，眞是層出不窮。雖則一杯茶，憑你飲一杯起碼貨的白開水，算賬也要兩個角子。</p>
<p>（菊花茶喜歡不？啞唷，先生，揩把臉吧！）她終於送上兩杯菊花茶，并且擠了兩把熱烘烘的手巾。</p>
<p>（先生，帮帮忙，你們化幾個錢是不在意下的，謝謝。）她慇懃地招待着。她有波浪似的頭髮，烏油油眼珠，桃色的臉蛋，殷紅的嘴唇，凡此都能引起陸的一顆心兒的燃燒。於是他拿出全副勇氣來開始和她閒談。</p>
<p>（你們一天能有多少生意可做？）</p>
<p>（好些一天工夫可賣百來杯茶，但是賬房裏要對拆的呢。）</p>
<p>（唔！每天能賺五六元不等。）</p>
<p>（事很苦的，晝夜的忙東忙西。）</p>
<p>（那末你爲何不另謀較好的工作呢。）</p>
<p>（話是不錯。先生，如果抛棄現有的事而不幹的話，如何維持生活？社會可以給我們較好的事嗎？當然又是一個問題。尤其在現實的社會，女子謀業更難。）</p>
<p>（當眞你到這里的動機在那裏？倒要來瞎問問哩。）</p>
<p>（老實説呵！我的家鄕遠在瀋陽，當九一八事變初起，我們的長官不抵抗，把國土｜｜也就是我們的故鄕，拱手奉送暴日，遂同老母逃來上海。弟弟呢，眼看國土淪亡未復，他想爲我民族爭回一線人格，業已加入義軍去了！）她的態度非常憤怒悲壯。（話又説回來，因爲不能把耗費白米的嘴吧暫擱不用，托盡親友千方設法，才留職在此地。）　　莊聽到她的話，特别的是（他想爲我民族爭回一綫人格）的一句話，他頓時生出慚顔無地的心理，他想，榆關現已失陷，日本急急侵佔熱河，又呈嚴重的狀態中，回復想到東北忠勇的義勇軍，正在冰天雪地與暴日作殊死戰，他們没有寒衣披體，没有兵力增援……於是他心靈上又起了一種無名的傷感！他，莊，再不有心緒聽戲了，很懊怒似的扯著陸的衣裳説：</p>
<p>（回去！把兩杯菊花茶付了錢回去！）</p>
<p>他們離開了歌聲囂攘的游戲塲，從鴿籠式的電梯乘了下來。</p>

<p>編者先生：自從（店員通訊）誕生後，很想把我的問題，提出來請先生賜敎；但是因爲才疏學淺的緣故，使我没有勇氣動筆，終於求知慾勝過了羞恥心，今天我就老着面皮寫這封信給你：倘有不通或别字，還望恕我是一個小學還没有畢業的人，加以指正。</p>
<p>我今年已二十歲了，論理是正在奮發有爲的時代：可是因爲受了不良家庭的影響，和惡劣環境的壓迫，使我不得不悲觀而消極。</p>
<p>我的慈母；在十年以前，就離我而長逝；後來的繼母，兇悍異常。幼年時所受的痛苦，余也不忍再述，現在她雖然哭臉相向，但是暗裏却正在設法擺布我呢！</p>
<p>男大當婚，女大當嫁，這當然是人生必經之路。不料她竟異想天開，硬要我與她的甥女結婚。在普通説來，表姊妹成爲夫婦，是再好没有的；但是她主張此説，却其中另有作用呢！她現在自己生了四個小孩，最大的才五歲：眼見年逾花甲的父親，是不能始終包庇她們，所想出這法子來束縛我。</p>
<p>現在她娘家很好，　父等在上海很有面子；我目下的生意，全在他們掌握之中。她料我不敢與飯碗使性，所以堅持她這個鬼計；怕我娶了别個女人，旣不能同她合作，而且假使女家也有勢面的話，那末我的生意，可以不靠她的弟弟了。</p>
<p>現在我想脱離家庭及　父等的範圍，但是在這勢利的社會裏，前途也很渺茫：萬一謀事不成，豈不成了（要爭氣，氣不爭）嗎？先生，像我這種情形，還是忍耐下去好呢？還是自尋出路好呢？希望你及早給我一個指導。（下略）余堃夫謹上。</p>
<p>···············</p>
<p>編者按；余君的來信，驟讀之下，似乎包括婚烟與擇業兩問題。但一經詳細研究，他所以要拒絶與他表妺結婚，以及急於要脱離他母舅的緣故，無非爲要擺脱他後母的籠絡，所以這純粹是一個後母問題。</p>
<p>當余君的生母棄養的時候，算來他父親年已五十以外，而余君則才及十齡，倘使没有他後母來主持家政的話，那没他父親顧了職業，就顧不到子女；顧了子女，就顧不得職業。我們不得不認爲她是余君家庭裏的功人。鷄皮貼不上鴨身，余君對之，雖不能視同己母，但終不能視同陌路。現在她爲了日後生計問題，委屈求全，心亦良苦，夫子之道，忠如而已，余君似乎也應當盡釋前嫌，待之以禮，以博他父親的喜悦。至於婚烟問題，余君當然有自决權，但是須要以對方的品性學問爲前提，萬不可有其他成見雜乎其中。我們還以爲倘使能與這後母的甥女結婚，倒也可以避免一般社會上所看見的姑媳爭閙，未始非余君終身之福。</p>
<p>至另謀高就一節，那末應當視現在的位置，有没有希望面定。面且爲了妥當起見，最好採用（騎馬找馬騎）的方法。正不必因爲目前的位置，是後母的弟弟所荐的緣故，抱一種（一日不可居）的觀念。</p>
<p>西方人有一句諺語，説（帶了藍眼鏡望去，一切都是藍的）。余君對於後母的觀念，怕也中了這句話的情形；因此覺得後母的一切，甚至與後母略有開係的一切，都比毒蛇猛虎還可怕。希望趕快能把這藍眼鏡除下，心平氣和地與你後母相處。</p>

<p>㈢有了她眞能多活幾年</p>
<p>黛秋小姐|若華的女兒|不識不知的隨嫁到夏家來，因夏仲　並無親生子，便頂了夏姓。女孩子長得伶俐活潑，除夏太太外，合家都很歡喜她，仲南更將她像掌珠般愛着，入門後，立刻送她去上學，直到仲南卸任回鄕，剛離學校生活。</p>
<p>仲南的大太太！性情固執，氣量窄狹，完全是舊式女子的典型。她本來就有一種肝氣痛的毛病，發作得厲害時，便會痛得昏厥過去。從前不過每年發一兩次病，自從若華進門以後，她發病的次數便漸漸的增多了｜雖然仲南和若華都不敢去侵犯她，却是她自己想像出來的氣惱。</p>
<p>仲南受那拖油瓶小姐，夏太太看見了也是很妒忌的，往往在下人面前駡她是野種，下人在大太太面前，只准呌黛秋的名字，不許人喚她小姐。茂生本非大太太所喜，但因要與黛秋鬥勝，便故意的表示鍾愛，把他棒得極高。利用了這一對小兒女，她就可以打鷄駡狗的夫蹧蹋若華。若華屢次要想反抗，都被仲南按捺住。</p>
<p>大太太捧茂生以抑黛秋，偏偏茂生是一個不爭氣的東西：非但讀書不敵黛秋聰　，並且常做出許多下流事來，弄得下人們都瞧不起。大太太爲了這兒子也常常的氣得發肝胃氣病。</p>
<p>五老爺幼中隨着哥哥在任上讀書，若華知道仲南最愛這位小兄弟，她便格外待他親熱，呵寒問暖，無所不至，幼中心裏十分感激，當着哥哥的面曾對若華説</p>
<p>（長嫂如母，二姨嫂雖不是長嫂，但愛護我的心眞同我的慈母一樣。）</p>
<p>（五弟説話，眞要折殺我哩！我們都是一家人，又是千里迢迢的出門在外面，應當要互相照應才是道理，你年紀輕輕一個人在外頭用功，將來有了出息，也是我們夏家的光榮，做哥嫂的不照應，難道去敎外人照應不成？五弟説這此客氣話倒不像自己人哩！）</p>
<p>（我有了她呵···）仲南坐在沙發上，笑着對幼中説道；（有了她眞能多活幾年。一切家務，什麽事都不用我煩心，我没有想到的事，她早就替我辦妥了。敎人精神上舒服！）</p>
<p>（二姨嫂，可惜了！）若華與仲南都向幼中一怔，聽他繼續説道：（可惜好是一個女子！否則，大有省長之才。</p>

<p>一九三二年之上海汽車註册數業巳揭曉。其數目較之往年頗有增加。是以汽車商人不以去春之戰事。及商業蕭條而減少其樂觀。此項增加之數目。雖不能與營業最盛之年相比擬。但一九三二年十二月三十一日止。公共租界與法租界之汽車註册數共達一五·三六五輛。軍用汽車尙不計内。較之往年實增五百四十四輛之多。自一九三二年十月十日滬杭公路開幕以來。海上汽車商於預計一九三三年之營業時。目爲異常滿意。滬杭公路包括通達南京之國道在内。可供駕駛所用者共長三百五十英里。據中國汽車俱樂部稱。第二次鋪路業將竣工。而於五月一日。定能通過重車也。杭州附近又有四百英里之汽車道。日常供人使用。此路之成。雖不能令本埠汽車陡然增加。但公路沿途及附近各地車行。購用上海市上之舊車者。數亦不少。</p>
<p>邇來滬上用車者。對於汽車之標準。較之一年前。其程度業已提高。因之市上敝舊之汽車。巳不多見矣。風行一時之流線化車輛。於此亦足多也。輕便車輛近來頗爲盛行。因其買價較廉。而每月費用。亦殊便宜。其所有之汽油滑潤油等。以親大車。相去蓋遠矣。此項車輛。以英國廠家所造者爲最著。法蘭西·日耳曼及意大利亦殊不弱。</p>
<p>一九三二年滬上汽車註册數。仍以福特之一·三九九輛。榮居班首。福特之英廠所出者亦包括在内。馬律斯車此次越過别克而居亞軍地位。其註册數計爲一千零九十四輛。别克則爲一千零八輛。雪佛蘭處第四位。計八百二十五輛。粤司汀居第五。計六百六十八輛。司蒂倍克數稍弱計五百六十二輛。飛霞脱爲大陸製造之汽車。居第七位。註册數爲五百四十一輛。其他各牌汽車之多寡。可由下表觀之　　一九三二年十二月三十一日上海汽車統計</p>

<p>去年底。據正式統計示。市上之運貨汽車。計共三千二百八十九輛。一九三一年十二月三十一日則爲三千三百七十輛。兩兩相較。計少去八十一輛。考慮此種數字時。有一端必須注意者。即凡運貨汽車一輛。運用時須在兩處註册納費。統計時往往因重疊之故。而生糾紛也。公共租界之運貨汽車註册數。由一·九三五輛减爲一·八二三輛。計减去一百十二輛。法租界則增加三十一輛。其數目爲一·四三五輛比一·四六六輛。此數可表示法租界運貨汽車之增加。但在公共租界亦未必一定减少。因有數車主在法租界者。或不將公共租界之車照更新。但法租界之運貨車業。殊有增加耳。福特及司蒂華兩種。視前稍有遜色。鐵玲司蒂文斯車之增加。則可覘公共汽車事業之發達也。</p>

<h3 id="c204">史丹達新車之驚人成績影呆 <a href="#c204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>｜九月間行路二千里｜</p>
<p>史丹達新車。最近製造方面。倍見優美。是故時有驚人之成績。最近有一四六匹馬力之新式轎車。在毛糙之道上駛行。於九日之間。竟行路二·○○○哩。駕車者爲英國自由車及機車聯合會華爾丁君。此種新車。據可靠消息。謂業已到滬。陳列於中國汽車公司樣子間。言其優點。則行駛旣速。機件又復耐久。蓋機件之堅强。器物之耐久。乃史丹達車必具之優點。而新車必更有進步也。</p>
<p>更有一事。足爲讀者一述者。即以事實而言。史丹達車。自發動而後。以至到達目的地爲止。在任何環境之下。絶無窒碍發生。蓋此次華爾丁試車之時。在九日之者也。最後駛入克林哥境内。在蘇格蘭區内。該處或爲最危險之地點。而一般行旅之人。皆難以行經該處也。然在最近幾年之中。當局用大無畏之精神。在艱難困苦之下。建成高原道路一條。於是始有些少之旅客。行經其間。然有時仍不免有危险發生也。</p>
<p>在奥格斯得及愛維納斯之間。駕車之人。不得不向羅治納斯之南邊駛行。格倫多昔日爲一可怖之山崗。駛車之人。旣抵此山。十九必在恐怖之心也。回憶數之前。有輕便汽車多輛。駛行於山道之中。在是高之處。均須用人力推進。而此次史丹達車。則絶無困難發生。安然行駛。即在險阻之處。亦僅用第二擋排。沿途地質鬆軟。空氣新鮮。對於駕車之人。分外適宜。山道曲折。河道紛歧。水雲相間。林村並立。種種景色。不堪以筆墨描繪也。愛維圖中二噸六汽缸雪鐵龍卡車。係法商水電公司新購自霞飛路四二四號法大汽車公司用以修理天空電線者。</p>
<p>中。行路二·○○○哩。而所過之地。道路凹凸不平，設行駛之車輛，無相當之成績，必不能到達目的地，同行者有汽車多輛，而行駛結果，史丹達新車之成績。竟爲最優，實不能不令人贊美也，且當行車之時，减熱器中。即一滴之水。亦並未加過。他如機件方面。並未發生一次之弊病。而使汽車停頓者，即用最高之速率。行駛於最劣之道路上。並無過度之熱力。是故雖在寒冷之處。停車多時。發動之時。亦絶無窒碍，此種成績。在普通汽車之中。實不易多觀也。</p>
<p>此次駛車之時。九日之行程。言之頗有趣味。第一日行至華斐德爾。在勃賽爾及克德爾佛之中途。汽車機車。及自由車形成一線、行駛其中。乃爲最危險之區域。過克德爾佛後。路面較平。危險性亦較爲减少。駕車之人。自較爲安穏矣。其後經克克比。丹達芬。亞爾斯當。自賽華斯至曼羅斯，中經奥德伯及琪得保。已入蘇格蘭境内。於是地面較平。可用安全之速力矣。</p>
<p>當行車之時。駛行於脱威特河濱，及曼羅斯境内之際。是日天忽下雨。而是時在雨中行車，史丹達車車身之優美。使乘車者安坐車中。絶無苦感也。更見顯著矣。晚間駛抵卡爾羅。雨勢更甚。市中百業停頓。已有阻止前行之槪。然史丹達車。因有完美之車頂。防風阻雨。儘可安全行駛也。再隔二日，行抵愛維納斯。經奥祥恩。過愛維蘭爾。旣而又達格林奥治。亦爲粗毛之道路。然沿途景色之優美。委爲罕見納斯爲高原路中之都市。乃試車之時。視爲中心地點。行駛凡兩日之久。旣而因環境關係。向南部駛行。抵波爾斯。該處則爲新築之道路也。（未完）</p>

<p>(I) Mr. Duan Zhiquan's Arrival in the South</p>
<p>Foreign enemies are encroaching daily. Internal strife has not ceased. For over a year, the compatriots of the three northeastern provinces have continued to groan under the iron heel of Japanese imperialism. Although our government knows that the League of Nations is incapable of resolving this issue, it still hopes that it can have a modicum of awareness and uphold justice slightly. The enemy, on the other hand, takes an inch and wants a foot. Not only does it disregard the League of Nations, but it also relies on its military strength to employ the most barbaric and tyrannical imperialist policies, creating the so-called "Manchuria (puppet) government." Now, it has gone further to invade and occupy Yuguan, coerce Rehe, and threaten Beiping and Tianjin. What's even worse is that it uses the remnants of the Northeast puppet regime to incite internal unrest and buy off former pro-Japanese figures as its pawns, hoping to create a second Manchuria in our North China. Rumors have been swirling for months, and figures like Yoshida, Umezu, and Komai either openly travel back and forth under the guise of diplomatic qualifications or engage in secret military activities. What are their purposes? What are their schemes? All our countrymen should be aware of their intentions, which are to break up our nation's anti-Japanese front and attempt to establish another political organization under the command of Japanese imperialists. This goes without saying. Under such conspiracies, Mr. Duan Zhiquan is indeed considered by the Japanese side to be the most suitable figure. However, Mr. Duan has now defied his declining health and resolutely traveled south, shattering the Japanese scheme to exploit him and expressing his personal attitude. Here, we cannot but express our full sympathy, as he has not missed a good opportunity to save the country and agrees with our people's struggle to seek regeneration through their own efforts.</p>
<p>(II) Training the People in Struggle</p>
<p>If we can truly unite in good faith and "face the national crisis together," it will be a great driving force for breaking the current crisis. However, merely having leadership at the highest level, relying solely on recruitment and replenishment for soldiers, and relying solely on the government's search for financial resources will not be enough to compete with a powerful enemy on the battlefield. How can we win? Furthermore, the Japanese military has also clearly realized that modern warfare cannot be won without gathering the strength of the entire nation and utilizing all scientific facilities. Therefore, since Japan launched its invasion of our country, it has been loudly proclaiming that the national crisis is at hand, inciting its people. Right-wing groups are also active everywhere under the leadership and command of the military. In recent years, in our country, there has been some separation between the government and the people, and the majority of people in society have a complacent mentality of getting by, unable to exert themselves. This is indeed today's greatest malady. If the majority of the people rise up and strive, they can certainly subdue the powerful enemy externally and bring politics back on the right track internally.</p>
<p>Today's matter requires the political leadership to quickly seek stability and soundness. Merely the unity of a few leaders is not enough to cope with the current crisis. We must take the collective strength of the masses as the foundation, exert the great power of the entire nation to fight against the powerful enemy, and only then can we find life in death and overcome the contradictions of internal and external pressures.</p>
<p>The national character of our country favors peace, so that foreign enemies enter the house and still act with composure and calmness. Now that they have been bullied and humiliated, they are gradually waking up. From now on, they should even more refresh their spirits and strive to fight. The point of deciding victory or defeat in modern warfare is not entirely the artillery battle of three to five million soldiers on the battlefield, but the national support is the center of gravity of victory or defeat. During this period in our country, the general public should be trained in struggle, and it is necessary to gather the strength of the masses in order to have resistance to speak of. Otherwise, the function of unity will be lost, and how can we compete with a powerful enemy? Therefore, those in power should take advantage of this critical moment to enlighten the national instinct of cooperation as much as possible, gather the energy of the working masses to devote themselves to the country, and stand on the basis of fighting against Japan and reorganizing internally. Whether it is political, economic, or even daily life, we should all learn from the past mistakes of the Northeast, move forward bravely, and strive for the final victory.</p>

<p>Only Striving for Internal Development, Not Interfering in Other Countries' Affairs</p>
<p>Japan Refuses to Sign Non-Aggression Pact: What Exactly Are Their Intentions?</p>
<p>Moscow: Molotov, Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars of the Soviet Union, reported to the All-Union Central Executive Committee on the Soviet Union's national economic plan for 1933 and also discussed the situation in the Far East, stating roughly: The League of Nations' futile actions regarding the Far Eastern situation are now known to all. For over a year, the League of Nations has done its best to try to reach a resolution on the Manchurian issue in the Far East. It has repeatedly set deadlines to implement its resolutions and sent an investigative team to conduct on-site research. The investigative team returned to Europe long ago, and only then did it publish its report. The committees generate endlessly, but no resolution has been reached, and the event remains as it was. The League of Nations' actions have only produced one result, namely, revealing its incompetence to the world. The Soviet Union has never placed any hope in the League of Nations and its committees, but the various issues in the Far Eastern international relations have a close relationship with the Soviet Union. About a year ago, after the situation in the Far East arose, the Soviet government proposed to Japan the signing of a non-aggression treaty. In the current situation, this proposal cannot be ignored for its political importance. However, the Japanese government recently notified the Soviet Union that it refused to sign this treaty at this time. Molotov said that he dared not commend the motives that led Japan to reject this treaty. He also said that although the Soviet Union wanted to regard this rejection as temporary, it could not ignore the facts. Regarding the situation in the Far East, the Soviet Union has always maintained a policy of non-interference and absolute neutrality. For the sake of peace in the future, the Soviet Union will continue to strictly adhere to this position. However, certain facts and the attitude of some people in Japan towards the Soviet Union have recently attracted the Soviet Union's attention. Recently, the Japanese military published fabricated and provocative rumors in its press releases regarding the Soviet government and the future Soviet embassy in China. Although the Soviet Union denied them, Japanese Foreign Minister Uchida reiterated these absurd stories in parliament on January 21. Now, the Soviet Union does not intend to pay any more attention to them, because the Japanese are defeating their own schemes. As for the restoration of diplomatic relations between China and the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union believes that it has nothing to do with others and should not cause anyone's happiness or anger. In this move, the Soviet Union only affirms its maintenance of the foundation of ordinary peace. Regarding what Japanese Foreign Minister Uchida said in parliament, that since the Manchurian Incident occurred, because the Soviet government has adhered to a (cautious position), no incident has occurred between Japan and the Soviet Union, Molotov said that what should be pointed out here is that the Soviet policy is not only cautious but also exceptionally rational, because the Soviet government's attitude is still based on maintaining international peace. In the future, the Soviet government will more resolutely implement its purpose of maintaining peace with all countries, regardless of any interpretation by other countries' governments. Molotov concluded that the international situation made the Soviet Union feel the need for strict precautions again. This kind of precaution must be reflected in the entire effort of the Soviet Union, that is, the entire construction, because this is the foundation of the Soviet Union's economic and political strength.

<p>Rushing to Build a Large Number of Warships and Adding Air Squadrons</p>
<p>Total Expenses Require 460 Million Yen</p>
<p>Nanjing: The Naval Minister admitted in the National Assembly yesterday that next year's naval economic budget is 370 million yen, of which 87 million yen is the first installment of the so-called "second program of naval replenishment" by the Ministry of the Navy. It is learned that the funds required to complete this program total 460 million yen, to be allocated over four years. It is reported that under this program, the Ministry of the Navy plans to build two cruisers weighing 8,500 tons each, one aircraft carrier weighing 8,000 tons, seven destroyers weighing 1,400 tons each, six various submarines, one mine-laying ship weighing 5,000 tons, and several minesweepers and torpedo boats. The above-mentioned ships will be used to replace various old ships that have reached or are about to reach their age limit. The total cost of the new construction is about 360 million yen. The remaining 10 million yen will be used to add five naval air squadrons. If this move is realized, Japan will have a total of thirty air squadrons. (Reuters dispatch on the 24th)</p>

<p>Fearing Loss of Trusteeship's Right to Govern</p>
<p>Secret Military Deployments</p>
<p>Arising Concerns from All Sides</p>
<p>The League of Nations Administrative Council Will Submit for Discussion</p>
<p>Tokyo: According to diplomatic sources here, even if the League of Nations invokes Article 15, Paragraph 4 of its charter, Japan will not withdraw from the League of Nations, because once Japan withdraws, the right to govern the South Pacific Islands will inevitably be taken back by the League of Nations. According to the South Pacific Islands, if they are taken back by the League of Nations, Japan's power to wage war against the United States will be greatly reduced. Japan dares to openly provoke the United States in the Pacific, relying entirely on its submarine fleet based in the South Pacific Islands. Therefore, when the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs heard that the League of Nations had decided to invoke Article 15, Paragraph 4, it not only dared not express fierce opposition, but also telegraphed the Japanese representative not to declare withdrawal. It only ordered the Japanese representative to return home, but still expressed participation in the disarmament conference and the world economic conference convened by the League of Nations. Japan's move is to implement the strategy of obtaining its rights but not fulfilling its obligations, in order to wait for the self-destruction of the international community. (China United Press dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<p>London: The British Daily Express published a message on its front page today about Japan secretly building naval bases in the Pacific Islands. The newspaper's Geneva dispatch stated that reports on this matter will be submitted to the League of Nations Administrative Council this week. When the Japanese representative was questioned in a closed-door meeting of the Trusteeship Committee, he denied the news, but ultimately could not dispel the doubts about the events now discovered in the Mariana and Palau Islands. After repeated interrogations, the Japanese admitted that they had spent more than 100,000 pounds in British gold on naval bases and would continue to do so. According to reports, Palau Island was sold to Germany by Spain in 1899 and occupied by Australia in 1914. The Treaty of Versailles stipulated that this island be entrusted to Japan for administration. The Mariana Islands consist of fifteen islands of various sizes, originally owned by Spain. Among them, the largest island, Guam, was ceded to the United States in 1898, and the rest were sold to Germany the following year. In 1914, it was seized by Australia, and later Japan was also entrusted with trusteeship. (Reuters dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<p>London: (Daily People's Voice) received a message from the newspaper's correspondent in Geneva, saying that there are rumors that Japan is establishing naval bases in the Pacific. The Administrative Council of the League of Nations will consider this news within this week. At a certain meeting, the Japanese representative was questioned in detail. The Japanese representative firmly denied this news, but people still worry about the situation in the Macao and other islands in the Pacific entrusted to Japan's rule. (Daily People's Voice) also stated that the earliest news about this matter came from the United States. Americans are extremely worried because if naval bases are built in the islands in the Pacific entrusted to Japan, it would not only violate Article 22 of the League of Nations Covenant, but also be greatly contrary to the Washington Four-Power Treaty. (According to Article 22, Paragraph 5 of the League of Nations Covenant, the entrusted state shall not build fortresses and naval and military bases within the territory of the trusteeship. The Washington Four-Power Treaty was signed by the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and Japan at the Washington Conference in 1921, and it is related to the Pacific Islands entrusted to Japan's rule.)

<p>Both the London Labour Party's Daily Express and the Liberal Party's News Review discuss the importance of the League of Nations' drafting of a report on the Sino-Japanese dispute. The Daily Express stated, "The situation is serious, so the League of Nations must carry out its work with firmness and courage, but not with recklessness. The timidity and hesitation of last year resulted in nothing. This lesson still exists. If we merely approve the Lytton Report and attach a very vague narrative, and make hollow suggestions that China and Japan should seek an agreement based on the methods proposed by Lytton et al., then we are simply shirking responsibility. The League of Nations Assembly cannot use the Lytton Commission as a shield. The League of Nations will proceed, or should proceed, to what extent? This is an event that should be decided with an extremely calm mind. However, what we expect from the League of Nations is that the international community must have a practical and final determination not to wash its hands of this matter. Whatever the League of Nations can do, the League of Nations must not give up." The News Review stated, "Geneva has taken a sharp turn in the right direction. The League of Nations has only now launched its first initiative. To let the two parties handle the truth themselves is to allow them to start a war that endangers the world. Any war or war crisis is an event related to the League of Nations. This is a recognized doctrine. If the League of Nations abandons this doctrine, it would be very sad. Until yesterday, we did not dare to believe that the League of Nations would not abandon this doctrine. Now, it has determined its position, and the British government has clearly shown the world that Britain is a friend of the League of Nations. We do not want it to fight, nor do we want it to blockade Japan, but we want it to announce that no country is allowed to achieve its goals by methods that the world regards as intolerable." (Reuters dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<p>London: The Times commented today on the final steps in the Manchurian problem, saying that those who criticize the League of Nations for hesitating and indecisive forget that changing with the times is sometimes the best policy among all policies. The Times quoted a letter from the daughter of former Prime Minister Asquith, published in the newspaper, saying that the League of Nations is not a supreme state, but a mechanism for passive or active joint policies. The Times also stated that there is indeed no necessary condition in the Sino-Japanese dispute case for the League of Nations to act, so the League of Nations can only draft what it considers possible and fair solutions, and the solutions must be sought along the outline of the Lytton Report. Unfortunately, Japan has rejected it with a completely unreasonable attitude, using this report as the basis for a solution. To make a moral judgment on any member is not the duty of the League of Nations membership. Japan is an important member of the League of Nations. If it understands the difficult position of the League of Nations and undertakes to abide by the recommendations of the League of Nations, then Japan can hope to restore its lost sympathy.

Navy Minister Osumi also replied that those involved in the incident were now sincerely repentant, and immediately read out the confession of one of the defendants in the May 15th incident. The content is as follows: (In the future, to achieve the goals of this era, such as destroying current means and methods, is not what should be done by those who idealize national life and strive for ideal improvement. This is tantamount to castles in the air and mirages. If one does not have a firm footing and relies on one's actual life, even if it is any transformation movement, it is merely an emptiness away from reality and a pest to national life. Therefore, thinking about it now, I deeply feel the foolishness of blindly rushing forward. I was wrong, I was wrong. In the past years, singing the protection of great compassion, is that not great compassion?)</p>

<p>Washington, National News Agency, 23rd, a movement has now been launched in the US Congress with the aim of adopting the plan proposed by Briand 36 years ago, re-establishing silver as currency, and simultaneously reducing the price of gold dollars to promote economic progress. Senator Werner declared today that he will propose a plan to re-coin silver at a gold-silver ratio of sixteen to one in order to urge Congress to discuss the silver issue. His plan will be used as an amendment to the Glass Banking Reform Act so that it can be considered sooner, as the Glass Act is already under consideration in the committee and will be scheduled in the Senate earlier than any new bill. At the same time, Senator Borah advocated reducing the price of gold dollars, claiming today during the discussion of the balanced budget issue that the budget balance cannot be discussed until taxpayers themselves balance their income and expenditure. Today, because the government insists on maintaining the gold standard, the economy has been greatly affected. Not only has it lost foreign markets, but domestic markets have also been seized by low-cost goods from countries that have abandoned the gold standard, resulting in the decline of people's livelihoods. Furthermore, all economic problems between countries should also be resolved. There is the possibility of adjusting trade conditions, but it must be through the joint efforts of all countries.</p>

<p>Berlin, National News Agency, 23rd, although the Nazi Party's parade held a few days ago did not cause any accidents, rumors of an imminent cabinet reshuffle are rampant again. It is said that the current Schleicher government will resign, and will be succeeded by a mixed cabinet of distinctly right-wing and extremist nature. After that, it will reverse the policies of the Schleicher cabinet, absolutely not cooperate or reach an understanding with the Catholic Center Party, and will disregard the interests of the masses behind the Center Party and the left wing. The reason for this political change is that Schleicher has expressed a stubborn and unyielding attitude, contrary to the expectations of the various right-wing parties. Therefore, the various right-wing parties are now working hard to connect separately and organize the situation of restoring parliamentary government.</p>

<p>Chengde Telegram: Shenbao and 　 distinguished gentlemen, according to the report from Tang, the commander of the Third Army, the violent Japanese bandits are resorting to extreme measures, seizing debts and causing resentment. Recently, they have intensified their efforts, and after seizing Shanhaiguan, they have occupied Rehe Province, acting like wolves and disregarding public justice. As soldiers, we have an unshirkable responsibility. Previously, in Eastern Liaoning, we gathered comrades in Huanren and raised the banner of righteousness in Tonghua. Zhang Zongzhou, the director of the Huanren Public Security Bureau and concurrently the commander of the county's Public Security Corps, led his troops to assist in driving out the enemy. He was appointed as the commander of the Self-Defense Army and supported Xinbin. In Andong, Kuandian, and other counties, he contacted the Japanese army more than a hundred times, fought fiercely dozens of times, and killed more than a thousand enemies. Until October of the previous year, the Japanese army 　killed our people and launched a land and air siege, again and again. He was forced to hold out as an isolated army with exhausted ammunition and no reinforcements. Ju Wu painfully reorganized the troops, placing Vice Commander Zhang Zongzhou in command. He went to Beiping alone to seek instructions. The Vice Commander went into hiding, fearing that the lonely army would fight hard and only lose its strength. Kuandian Tianqiaogou and other places, and ordered Zhou Fuchen, the commander of the Zhou Detachment, to lead a team of more than 1,200 people to retreat to Huanren and Panhuangling in Goryeo, totaling more than 10,000 people, waiting for an opportunity to rise up. The Vice Commander also lacked ammunition and weapons, so he divided the troops among the officers and commanders and 　came to Beiping to appeal for help. There is also Ying Ruoyu, the commander of the Fifteenth Route Army, who reported the same reason in Beiping. Commander Ying's more than 16,000 troops are now hiding in Huadian, Antu, Dunhua, Emu, and other counties. Wang Fengguan, commander of the Nineteenth Route Army, has more than 10,000 troops in 　Han and Linjiang. The above units are 　waiting for assistance. Apart from those who were wronged and remained in their original places, the total number of troops hiding and accumulating strength is over fifty to sixty thousand. These troops have fought hard for years, and in this freezing weather, they lack clothing and food, but their anti-Japanese spirit has not diminished. If the people of the country provide them with assistance, so that they have clothing and food and do not lack weapons and ammunition, they are a usable force in the Far East. Ju Wu has now gathered troops and is heading to the Rehe border to work desperately. With a little assistance, they can continue their previous efforts. I hope that you will appreciate the spirit of hard fighting in the past, and inform the people at home and abroad of the truth, and allow patriotic gentlemen to provide assistance within their means. All assistance and donations will be given to General Zhu for forwarding, etc. It has been found that the area controlled by this department is strategically important, and the Japanese army attacked it fiercely for a reason. Although forced by circumstances, tens of thousands of people are hiding in various counties in Eastern Liaoning and can still inflict considerable punishment on the enemy at the necessary time. Recently, there have been fierce battles with the enemy in Qingyuan Nankouqian and Jinchuan Gannanjiaan. Tang Jun is also on the Rehe border, gathering the old troops totaling six to seven thousand people, planning to go to Eastern Liaoning at the appropriate time and restore the old territory. Their ambition is very strong. I hope that you will give them strong assistance so that they can achieve their goals. 　The Jilin-Heilongjiang People's Support Association is extremely grateful.</p>

<p>Japanese Navy Warships</p>
<p>The total tonnage of the navy is 1,259,000 tons, 356 ships (this is the number Japan notified the League of Nations in September of the previous year). The number of active fleets is about 850,000 tons, 251 ships. The actual number cannot be published. As for the organization of the fleet: (1) First Fleet - First Battle Squadron, Second Battle Squadron, Third Battle Squadron, First Torpedo Squadron, First Submarine Squadron, (2) Second Fleet - Fourth Battle Squadron, Fifth Battle Squadron, Second Torpedo Squadron, Second Submarine Squadron, First Aviation Squadron, (3) Third Fleet stationed in Shanghai, First Overseas Fleet stationed in Shanghai, Second Foreign Fleet stationed in North China, Training Fleet for ensign candidates distant 　sea use.</p>
<p>Restricted Defense Areas in the Pacific</p>
<p>United States: Philippines, Guam (south of the Macoa Islands), Samoa, Aleutian Islands</p>
<p>Britain: Hong Kong, Borneo</p>
<p>Japan: Kuril Islands, Ogasawara Islands, Amami Oshima, Ryukyu, Taiwan, Penghu Islands</p>
<p>(Note) Honolulu and Singapore are exceptions.</p>
<p>It is reported that since 1927, the ports in the islands under Japanese mandate in the Pacific have increased threefold compared to the original. The United States believes that this port reconstruction violates the League of Nations' mandate treaty, as Japan is reconstructing the island bays into fortresses as bases for the army and navy in preparation for war. Therefore, at the meeting of the Mandate Committee last November, the committee members raised serious questions to the Japanese representative Ito Shushi. Recently, the diplomatic circles in Geneva have paid close attention to this issue, believing that Japan's solid defense of the South Pacific islands will endanger the transportation between Honolulu and the Philippines, and also worry that if Japan withdraws from the League of Nations, it will have strong facilities in the Pacific. It is rumored that the US government has telegraphed its ambassador to Rome to raise the issue to the chairman of the committee, Dadley. However, the US State Department denied the matter.</p>
<h3 id="e86">Enemy Attempts to Attack Rehe Fail <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>Forces Will Cross the Shi River to Capture Luanzhou</p>
<p>Then Attack Rehe from Lengkou and Xifengkou</p>
<p>Disturbances Around Tianjin and Beiping Intensify</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: The silence on the Shi River and Shimen front lines has lasted for over ten days. Enemy aircraft bombings continue between Kailu and Fuxin, where tens of thousands of righteous soldiers are holding strategic positions with the support of Rehe troops, sufficient to cope with the situation. However, the enemy at Nanling Chaoyang Temple has attempted several attacks without success. The enemy planned to deploy six traitorous armies (two each under Yu Zhishan, Cheng Guorui, and Zhang HaiPeng) as the vanguard for attacking Rehe. Unexpectedly, many in the traitorous armies, deeply aware of righteousness, could not bear to kill their compatriots and deserted with their weapons, especially Cheng Guorui's troops, which are almost completely disbanded. This is because Cheng's troops are mostly composed of armed civilians from western Liaoning who were forced into service due to the oppressive environment and are not willing to betray their country. The enemy's unreliability of the traitorous armies has dealt a blow to their plans to attack Rehe. Recently, they have been digging trenches and building fortifications with electric fences in the Beipiao, Chaoyang Temple, and Nanling areas, indicating a shift to a defensive posture and the search for new, quicker routes to attack Rehe. According to a military expert, Japanese soldiers are extremely arrogant. Due to the Northeast Army's policy of non-resistance, they see the Northeast Army as mere deadwood. After occupying Shanhaiguan, they thought it would be like occupying Jinzhou, with the Northeast Army retreating and the matter being over. However, the soldiers and civilians of North China share a common hatred of the enemy, and international sentiment cannot be entirely exploited by the Japanese. The Japanese militarists seem unwilling to make too many enemies, so they only talk about taking Rehe as a problem of the puppet Manchurian state, temporarily setting aside Beiping and Tianjin, because Rehe has no American or European residents or businesses, which would not cause the intervention of the powers. As for their planned attack on Rehe, they have divided it into several routes. The three routes of attacking Kailu from Tongliao, Suidong from Zhangwu, and Fuxin from Xintun have already failed. The attack on Chaoyang from Nanling is also facing difficulties. Currently, only the route of attacking Lingyuan from Suizhong has not been tried. They are transporting munitions and food to Suizhong for a desperate attempt. If this route also proves difficult, they will inevitably cross the Shi River westward, attempting to seize the line of the river, and attack Chengde and Jianchang from Lengkou and Xifengkou. However, the Chinese army has already established defenses west of the Shi River, and it is doubtful whether the enemy will succeed. According to an observation by a certain important person, the enemy wants to seize the key areas of Rehe and will provoke incidents in Beiping and Tianjin to disrupt our rear defenses. Recently, Major General Umezu, Chief of Staff Koishihara, Colonel Doihara, and Advisor Sakahara have arrived in Tianjin and are the main figures planning disturbances in Beiping and Tianjin. It is said that the Tianjin plainclothes teams are still under the responsibility of Doihara. Since Hao Peng, the commander of the puppet North China People's Autonomous Salvation Army, was arrested in Beiping, a group of remaining cadres has held several secret meetings and, after reorganization by Doihara, have been reorganized into groups of ten, each group with a Japanese person as the leader, and every ten groups forming a team, with two Japanese people as the leader and deputy leader, directing everything. It is widely rumored that they plan to launch an incident in Tianjin on the anniversary of the January 28th Incident in Shanghai, with Beiping responding in support, but this news may not be reliable.</p>

<p>The diary starts from December 17th, Showa 7th year and ends on August 8th, Showa 8th year, totaling twenty-three days. Combined with what is written on the flyleaf, there are twenty-four entries. The diary is written in pencil and blue ink pen. The pencil writings are blurred and difficult to read. Here are selected the clearer and more significant entries, such as the text on the flyleaf and the entries from December 23rd and 26th of last year and January 5th of this year, translated as follows:</p>
<p>Looking at Watanabe's entire diary, his resentment of military service, his constant fear of death, and his unwillingness to fight against the Chinese are evident between the lines. He even criticizes his government's militaristic policies and deeply feels that life is tasteless, his situation pitiable, his emotions lamentable. If one Watanabe feels this way, many Japanese soldiers probably feel the same way. From this, we can gain two insights:</p>
<p>1.  Over the years, the militarists in Japan have been tyrannical, the politics chaotic, the economy in panic, and the ideology radical. Those with insight have long known that crises lurk everywhere, and the path is dangerous. Yet, the Japanese army still does not reflect, but instead engages in militarism and intensifies its invasion of neighboring countries, hoping to divert its people's attention and maintain its own position. Little do they know that the army they rely on to invade neighboring countries has undergone a great change in thought and is no longer blindly obedient and willing to be exploited. If our people can vow to defend themselves to the death and thoroughly resist, then the awakening of the Japanese people can be expected soon.</p>
<p>2.  The Japanese militarists, intoxicated by the victories of the Sino-Japanese War and the Russo-Japanese War, often boast to the world about the "imperial martial spirit" and the "power of the imperial army," as if the bravery and skill of the Japanese army are truly invincible. Now, after reading this diary and witnessing the Shanghai Incident, we know that the so-called "imperial martial spirit" and "power" are limited, and their fear and cowardice are even greater than others. Therefore, those with lofty ideals should deeply consider their responsibilities of resisting Japan and saving the nation, and only by fighting to the death can we achieve victory. Attached is an excerpt of the diary from January 21st.</p>
<p>Diary Excerpts:</p>
<p>Text on the Diary's Flyleaf: Our enemies are not the Chinese. The fields of Manchuria are not our battlefields. Our enemies are not so much the Chinese as they are the Japanese, the Japanese people should awaken from their self-respect, awaken from humanism. Now, the enemy country of China is gradually changing under our support, perhaps becoming a more powerful nation than us. Why should we fight against such an enemy?</p>
<p>December 27th: Tonight, I learned that the deployment is certain. The officers of the company are busy beyond words. Electric lights have been installed in the camp.</p>
<p>December 18th: Preparing to move out. There are many discussions, including with Watanabe-kun. The names of the soldiers going on expedition are announced, and my name is also on the list. Clothes, blankets, and other items are distributed.</p>
<p>December 19th: Assigned to the mobilized company. Mother, Hitoshi, and Shiro came to see me off at noon. My mother's strong mind, without shedding a tear, secretly pleases me. To comfort those left behind, I find it difficult to sit opposite them.</p>
<p>December 20th: Very busy with preparations. We inspect our military uniforms at one point. The division commander and brigade commander come to give instructions, roughly saying, "Soon they will become subjects under our rule, so if you kill someone, you should feel some sorrow. Pay attention to your health," etc. We also take a photo as a farewell memento. We bow and pay our respects to the military flag and the portrait of the Emperor. Uncle Uebayashi comes to see me off. I tell him not to worry about Mother. Several groups of people carrying lanterns come to the camp gate to send us off with cheers.</p>
<p>December 21st: Wake up at 1:30 AM. Depart from the camp at 3:30 AM. My horse is in good spirits and full of energy. Loading is completed at 5:30 AM. Head to the station. Depart at 8:00 AM. At Seto, the mother and friend of Fujiwara come to see me off. In Okayama, I meet my older brother Tadashi and Mr. Tachiki. Get off at Ujina at 3:30 PM.</p>
<p>Stayed for one night, the last night on home soil. I couldn't sleep. I only fell asleep a little after one o'clock.</p>
<p>December 22nd: At 6:30 AM, load the horses onto the "Goso Maru." I take one step at a time. It is a moment of departure from the Japanese land. Although I didn't shed tears, I still felt uneasy. The ship departs at 3:00 PM. The welcoming military vessels are sailing alongside our ship. I wanted to respond to their shouts of "Banzai," but I couldn't. While others were shouting "Banzai," I remained silent. But I regret that I don't have the determination to die.</p>
<p>December 23rd: Anchored at Shimonoseki. The most annoying thing is the merchants on the pier who are selling their goods at high prices to those of us who are about to part with our homeland. It even makes me feel that there is no need to die to protect the country of these people. At 4:30 PM, the shadow of our homeland gradually disappears from our eyes. The waves at night are very big, and I feel physically and mentally uncomfortable.</p>
<p>December 24th: After 10:00 AM, I see the Korean Peninsula. I receive cold-weather gear and put it on. I look like a fur-clad Russian. Some people even laugh. No one would have thought that we would be dressed like this. Wearing this clothing makes me sweat even without working. Once entering the Yellow Sea, the seawater turns yellow, which startles people. Life seems long, but it is actually very short. Within this short period, there are still those who await to bloom like a flower of humanity, and the great people of the future still do not know how they will achieve their greatness.</p>
<p>December 25th: Breaking through the waves of the Yellow Sea, the ship gradually becomes calm. We sail towards Dalian. The almost full moon hangs high in the blue sky, silently blessing our comrades' future. Standing on the deck without wearing a cold-weather vest, I feel very cold. The climate is so different. The time is one hour slower than in the homeland. From these facts, I cannot help but foresee that we have already left our homeland and are about to reach our destination.</p>
<p>December 26th (Arrive in Dalian): I get on the deck and watch the white birds gradually fly in from the middle of the island, entering Dalian Commercial Port. At 7:30 AM, the landing begins, but I stand by the outpost of Private Ono, feeling that life is tasteless. Later, I talk to the secretary Nakata and am given sake to drink, which gives me some meaning in life. I think that making friends is nothing more than this. I start playing in the streets at 1:30 PM, taking an automobile to see all of Dalian's famous sights in order to get a good look at them. It is good that no enemy figures have been seen yet.</p>
<p>December 27th: Gather at 9:00 AM. Go to the (Expense Section) with Fang. Leave home at 12:00 PM. From 5:00 PM, I stroll through the streets of Dalian and the piers with my comrades, as if I were touring my homeland in a dream.</p>
<p>December 28th (Arrive in Fengtian): Arriving in Fengtian at 7:30 AM. The temperature is 13.5 degrees above zero, and there is nothing unbearable. We gather the horses in the courtyard of the Fengtian Medical University. Seeing my beloved horse with icicles on its muzzle and frost on its body, spending the night in the open air in the northern suburbs, a strange feeling arises in my heart. Hearing talk of leaving to fight in May after opening the horse, it is also a touching matter.</p>
<p>December 29th: Yesterday (Xisheng Hao) was crippled in the left leg by my neighbor, Tenmura-kun. It is truly pitiful. He had worked hard to reach the age of twenty, but all his affairs were ruined. Now that he has lost a horse, how will a cavalryman advance?</p>
<p>December 30th: Gathered at 7:30 AM. The whole company only rose at 8:30 AM. Its situation is known. Ride in the train. The cold wind invades, constantly howling. Who can think of the icicles on the muzzle and the frost on the tail? The money I brought from my mother disappeared. Anyway, money will eventually be gone. It doesn't matter, let it be.</p>
<p>December 31st: I wake up at 4:00 AM when I am sleeping soundly. Prepare for departure at 6:00 AM. Head to Fengtian Station. Because the railway destroyed by the plainclothesmen last night is being repaired, we extended our departure to 1:00 PM and departed for Dahushan. Speaking of New Year's Eve, we don't even have dinner. The officers are all concerned about military affairs. Moving northwest, we start at 5:00 PM. The three trains are unable to move forward. At 12:00 PM, we finally arrive at Dahushan Station, occupying the station before the enemy. I go to the horse stable on duty, standing in the fields of Manchuria, spending New Year's Eve.</p>
<p>January 1st: While sleeping, I tremble and resist as if I am about to freeze to death, lying in the cabin, quietly waiting for the dawn. At 6:00 AM, I eat a half-cooked breakfast that seems to be slightly spoiled. At the foot of Dahushan, the companies form a line and sing the New Year's song together, standing before the enemy in a quiet gathering. It is not an anniversary event. There are two or three families living in the station, and also three or four prostitutes. It has already become a family. Also, I am already thinking about yesterday's battle.</p>
<p>January 2nd: At 10:00 AM, we occupy a large house inhabited by good Chinese civilians. We rest our bodies in the empty house. The local Chinese politely urge us to work, which really makes us feel ashamed. But we eat in our mouths and don't say anything.</p>
<p>January 3rd: At noon, I receive the order from the flag leader and know that there are bandits in Black Mountain. So I think and move quickly, rushing in the wilderness, following the scout Yano, doing reconnaissance. I see a train, earnestly carrying folk flags and white flags, gradually approaching me. I immediately go back to report, only to find that the visitor is an American inspector. The officers nervously hold their guns, rushing onto the car like the wind, while they are holding a banquet, and I return in disappointment.</p>
<p>January 4th: Arrive at the county town. I don't see the bandits, but I see four heads hanging high on the telephone poles outside the city. Perhaps they are the bandits' heads. It doesn't seem like bandits are attacking. I originally planned to go, but the situation is unclear, and the dogs are barking loudly. I find a large courtyard to spend the night and wait for dawn. Then I vigorously whip my horse, rushing down the road, returning without any gains. On the way, I use a machine gun to do a trial shooting.</p>
<p>January 5th: There are no enemies, but we are forced to do exercises against imaginary enemies. Who knows the sadness in this? If anyone knows, they will sigh that this kind of exercise is a meaningless act. In the morning, we gather on horseback and do a dismounted battle exercise near Gotabuko (transliteration).</p>
<p>January 6th: Wake up at 5:00 AM and move towards the Badokou Mine. Our squad pushes large luggage and moves forward slowly. It is seven miles away. Today, the north wind is very strong, and my hands and feet are cold. I can't help but miss my hometown. Arrive at 4:00 PM. There is a large power plant controlled by the British. The interior layout of the house is splendid, which is very surprising.</p>
<p>January 7th: Wake up at 5:30 AM and move towards Xinlitun. Everything is scarce, and there is nothing surprising. Arrive at 4:00 PM, and we move into the large house where Zhang Xueliang's army used to live. In this way, we occupy new territory without fighting. To whom should we boast about the spirit of the Yamato man?</p>
<p>January 8th: Today is the anniversary of the founding of the army. We hold a parade on horseback in the large square in front of the station. We eat Chinese food and drink Japanese sake for lunch.</p>
<h3 id="e88">Bloody Tragedy of the Hankou City Election <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: The Hankou Special City Party Department has been reorganized by central government officials for three years but has not yet been formally established. Recently, it was finally decided to elect members of the Executive and Supervisory Committees to establish the Party Department. The election date was originally scheduled for the 20th of this month. However, the central election supervisors, Zeng Kuoqing and Fang Juezhen, were traveling from Nanjing on the Xinxing Lun when it ran aground in Jiujiang. The election was temporarily changed to the 21st. There are over 4,500 party members in Hankou City. They were designated to vote in ten districts. The venues had been arranged in advance, and military and police personnel were requested to maintain order. Zeng and Fang arrived in Hankou on the 20th and held an emergency meeting at the City Party Department. They instructed the reorganization committee members of the City Party Department on two matters: (1) all party membership cards are invalid. Only those who have a certificate from the City Party Department are allowed to enter the venue. (2) Party membership cards without a stamp or with insufficient stamps must be stamped to be valid for entry. On the 21st, at 9:00 AM, as snow fell, party members from each district voted at the designated locations. In addition to personally inspecting the venues, Zeng and Fang also sent Cai Shuzhong, Rao Zhenchang, Zhou Xiaoxi, Fang Chengyan, Zhou Jietian, Tong Hua, Zuo Zhenxin, Chen Minjian, Chen Zhiguang, and Du Shusi to supervise the elections in each venue. Because there were many candidates, there were many instances of coercion of voters and forced proxy voting on the spot, which led to disputes. Except for Districts 1, 3, 4, 5, 9, and 10, violent incidents occurred in Districts 2, 6, 7, and 8. Most party members in District 2 voluntarily withdrew from the meeting. In District 7, three people were injured in beatings. In District 8, one person was injured in beatings. Because the order was disrupted, the election was stopped and the ballot boxes were broken. Zeng and Fang immediately decided to stop the election altogether. They sent the injured party members Liu Fangying, Ding Xianben, Xia Dengxun, and Tang Xigen to the hospital for treatment. They also telegraphed the situation to the central government for instructions. It is rumored that this election will be completely invalid and will be rescheduled after the central government sends Liu to take charge. (January 21st)</p>
<h3 id="e89">Guangdong Province Strengthens National Defense <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>Ordering Large Quantities of Military Equipment from Foreign Merchants</p>
<p>Especially Active in Anti-Aircraft Defense Arrangements</p>
<p>The Shanghai-based English newspaper, the "North China Daily News," reported on the 16th, via their Hong Kong correspondent, that foreign merchants engaged in the arms trade are not experiencing an economic downturn. The military authorities in Guangzhou recently ordered several field guns, some of which were delivered today. Since the Japanese occupied Manchuria, the Guangzhou military authorities have been ordering large quantities of rifles, mortars, and machine guns from Hong Kong foreign merchants to prevent a second Shanghai Incident by the Japanese. Recently, the authorities have also realized the importance of field guns and artillery in national defense and have ordered several more. It is reported that they will be installed at the Yantang Army University for officer training. The university's principal, General Chen Jitang, concurrently holds the position, so there are sufficient funds to make the school one of the key fortresses in the Southwest. Therefore, Hong Kong merchants who have dealings with European arms factories, especially Czech arms factories, are enjoying booming business. A British merchant in Hong Kong has secured an order for six anti-aircraft guns, but the buyer is surprisingly the Guangzhou Municipal Government. Mayor Liu Jiwen fears that Japanese aircraft will disrupt Guangzhou, so he purchased these to defend Guangzhou City. Half of the funds came from public donations, and the other half was allocated from the city's coffers. Japan has only one 900-ton gunboat stationed in Shamian in Guangzhou and has no naval or army troops stationed there. It seems that there is no fear of a Japanese military invasion. However, the Cantonese people are on guard against a surprise aerial bombardment of Guangzhou by the Japanese, so they are preparing in advance. Aircraft carriers have also been coveted by naval officers in Guangzhou. Recently, a group of officers came to Hong Kong to visit the British aircraft carrier Hermes, which sailed to the sea to conduct flight exercises for them. General Weng Zhaoyuan, who valiantly defended Shanghai's Baoshan County during the January 28th Incident last year, has returned to Hong Kong after visiting the Philippines. General Weng studied aviation in France and has superb flying skills. This time, he raised a large amount of air defense funds from overseas Chinese in the Philippines, which will be used to establish an air force team for the 19th Route Army. The Hong Kong overseas Chinese specially held a grand banquet to welcome him. Weng gave a speech on the situation of the Japanese army bombing Wusong at that time, which made the listeners resentful.</p>
<h3 id="e90">Guangdong Province Establishes Industrial Bureau in Hainan <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>Presiding Over the Development of Industries in Hainan Island</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: The communist bandits in Hainan Island have been gradually suppressed. The island's forests and marine products are abundant and urgently need to be developed to create profits. The Department of Construction recently petitioned the provincial government to establish a Hainan Island Industrial Bureau to manage the affairs. The provincial government has approved the establishment and appointed Zhu Chini as the director of the bureau. Zhu has already taken office and traveled with the staff to handle the matter. It is said that the Industrial Bureau is directly under the provincial Department of Construction. The internal organization includes technicians, engineers, and assistant technicians, each in a certain number, to be responsible for various technical affairs. Depending on the complexity of the affairs, additional staff may be added, and local experienced industrial experts may be hired as design consultants. If necessary for the development of industries, agricultural and forestry reclamation farms, animal husbandry farms, various industrial manufacturing plants, and various exhibition halls may be established. The matters to be handled by the bureau are defined as follows: (1) matters related to industrial administration, (2) matters related to the development of fishery and salt mines, (3) matters related to the improvement and promotion of agriculture, industry, commerce, and related matters, (4) matters related to the investigation, design, management, and planning of all industries, (5) matters related to assisting the development of domestic products and improving industries. As for the industries that should be developed first: (1) increase food production and improve seeds, (2) increase livestock production and improve quality, (3) improve fishing and manufacturing, (4) trial planting and improvement of cotton and hemp, (5) extensive planting and improvement of local specialties such as rubber, coconuts, betel nuts, jackfruit, and coffee, (6) manufacturing of various agricultural and industrial products, (7) salt manufacturing. The director of the bureau is responsible for all the above-mentioned management and operation matters. The director has two departments under him, each with two section chiefs and several staff members, who carry out their duties under the director's orders. (January 18th)</p>
<h3 id="e91">Air Defense Equipment in Fujian Province <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>Weng Zhaoyuan Arrives in Fujian to Discuss Organizing Volunteer Army</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: The Pacification Commissioner's Office in Fujian Province previously recruited over one hundred retired air force officers and generals from Guangdong to come to Fujian to establish an aviation squadron in the province. However, Fujian only has seven small aircraft, which are mainly used to transport important people and are difficult to use in actual warfare. A month ago, Weng Zhaoyuan and Zou Minchu were specially sent to British and American colonies in Southeast Asia to promote aviation to save the nation and raise funds to purchase fighter planes. Now Weng has completed his mission and returned to the country. He arrived in the province from Shanghai the other day and reported to Jiang Guangnai and Cai Tingkai about the promotion situation in the American colonies. He said that the trip was very successful and received great sympathy from overseas Chinese. In various ports of the Philippines, twenty-six aviation associations were organized, with over 12,000 members, raising over 700,000 Philippine pesos, which can be used to purchase fifteen fighter planes. The funds are temporarily deposited in local banks by the associations. He is currently negotiating with Cai Tingkai to organize a volunteer army to go north to resist the Japanese. It is reported that Weng asked Cai to select two elite brigades from the 19th Route Army, and Weng will also gather the old troops of the volunteer army he trained in Suzhou and Wuxi last year, forming another brigade, obtaining a total of 15,000 men to lead to the border to fight the enemy. The detailed plan is under discussion. As for the province's anti-aircraft defense plan, according to an aviation team officer, the important commercial ports of Fujian Province, such as Fuzhou, Xiamen, Quanzhou, Xinghua, and Sandu, are all located along the coast, close to Taiwan, and are subject to the threat of enemy aircraft at any time. It is estimated that the value of buildings in each port averages no less than 50 to 60 million yuan, which is the essence of the province. If they are bombed by enemy aircraft, they will be instantly turned to dust. Therefore, building air defenses is the most urgent task for Fujian Province at present. As for the steps, the first is to purchase more anti-aircraft guns to prevent enemy aircraft from approaching, and the second is to equip fighter planes so that they can counter the enemy. However, the most urgent task is still to place more anti-aircraft guns. Roughly speaking, five ports need around 250 anti-aircraft guns to be useful. The 250 anti-aircraft guns are worth about 7 million yuan. The government may have difficulty raising this large amount of money at once, so it hopes that the people will raise the money themselves in the short term, while the government focuses on purchasing fighter planes. With division of labor and cooperation, it will be easy. (January 19th)</p>

<p>Relief for Rural Areas and Military Reclamation</p>
<p>Nanning Correspondence: The Guangxi province has made significant progress in developing roads, rigorously training the militia, and strictly enforcing bans on gambling and opium. These efforts have already been realized. Recently, they have also launched relief programs for rural areas and military reclamation projects. The general situation is as follows: (1) Rural Relief: Guangxi's rural areas have been less affected by external influences and have not yet fallen into bankruptcy. However, the local government is concerned that various construction projects may increase the burden on the people. In addition to reducing the number of standing soldiers to alleviate the financial burden and relieve the people, the government has decided to allocate a certain percentage of income from military and political circles each month, starting this year, to be specifically deposited as funds for lending to farmers and providing relief to rural villages. This income donation method only involves a portion of the military budget, and it is estimated that approximately 100,000 yuan can be obtained each month, and over 1 million yuan each year. The distribution procedures will be managed by the Guangxi Provincial Bank's branch offices. (2) Preparing for Military Reclamation: Guangxi has a relatively sparse population and a large amount of wasteland. In order to increase production and reduce the burden of military expenses, the local government has decided to adopt a system of military land reclamation, starting this year. They are currently drafting implementation rules and regulations and are initially selecting land in Guilin, Liuzhou, and Longzhou to build houses and purchase seeds and farming tools, with the aim of starting operations in the shortest possible time. This matter is of great importance to the future of agriculture, so all sectors are eagerly anticipating its success. (January 17th)</p>

<h3 id="e98">Chunze Company Robbed <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>At approximately 7 p.m. on the 20th, two bandits suddenly broke into the Chunze Reclamation Company in Xiaojie, east of Yucheng, and stole all the cash reserves in the safe, amounting to several thousand yuan. Another bandit used scissors to injure the head of Ah Zhao, a worker from Gongzhai Street, who was in the company, and looted him of 60 yuan. At that time, the merchant militia stationed in the Chamber of Commerce had already heard the alarm and rushed to the He Bridge, dozens of steps away from the company, and fired shots to intimidate the bandits. The two bandits then successively fled and escaped. Two bandits were captured. Afterwards, the company checked the losses and found some of the stolen cash left behind by the bandits in the store, leaving a shortage of 1,380 yuan. The weapons and grenades belonging to the bandits were made of mud and coated with paste. They were abandoned on the ground as they fled. As for the captured bandit, he confessed that his name was Wang Chuanfa, and his accomplice who escaped was named Wang Asan. The two men confessed that the robbery was initiated by Wang Asan. Since the incident, all businesses have been wary and closed early.</p>

<p>The former residence of Zhang Jingda, a high-ranking official of the Qing Dynasty, located opposite Longmen Lane on West Street in the city, was vast in scale and had numerous buildings. It is currently occupied by the rear service office of the Third Army, with the rear building being the residence of Li Weichuan from Fengtai County. At 10 a.m. on the 12th, a fire broke out in Li's residence due to carelessness while warming himself by the fire. The fire spread to the front building. The gasoline stored by the Third Army ignited, causing the fire to spread rapidly. The rear service office immediately moved the military supplies and reported the incident by telephone to various agencies. County Magistrate Wang, the Public Security Bureau Chief, and the Chief of the Inspection Office, Dong, immediately ordered a large number of soldiers and police to supervise the fire hoses to put out the fire. It was not until 1 p.m. that the fire was extinguished. Three five- or six-story buildings were burned down, resulting in losses of approximately tens of thousands of yuan. When the fire was at its height, the post office next door was affected. At that time, because of the urgency of the situation, there was chaos. Work was suspended for half a day on the afternoon of the 12th.</p>

<p>Duan Talks About Striving for Self-Salvation, Patriotism Has No Division</p>
<p>Temporarily Staying in Shanghai, Will Travel to Hangzhou When the Weather Warms</p>
<p>Duan Qirui, who has been residing in Tianjin, has accepted the invitation of Chiang Kai-shek, Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission, and resolutely traveled south. After arriving in Nanjing, he received a warm welcome from all sides. The night before last, he took the overnight express train from Nanjing to Shanghai and arrived at the North Station at 8:02 a.m. yesterday morning. Over a hundred representatives from various sectors in Shanghai went to the station to welcome him. After disembarking, Duan went to the World Academy Residence on Fooking Road to rest. At noon, Mayor Wu hosted a reception at the Academy. Last night at 7 p.m., Sun Ke hosted a banquet at his private residence on Columbia Road. Various organizations have scheduled a public banquet at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce on the 27th at noon. When Duan met with reporters from this newspaper yesterday morning, he stated that the only way to save the country is through self-salvation and that patriotism is shared by all, regardless of faction. Details are reported below.</p>
<p>Temporary Security at the North Station Before Duan's arrival, the North Station area was heavily guarded by security teams and police from the Fifth District, with patrols stationed at key points and platforms. The security was particularly tight when Duan's train arrived. Passengers were temporarily prevented from disembarking and all idlers were prohibited from entering the station. Traffic within the platform only returned to normal after Duan and his party left the station.</p>
<p>Warm Welcome from All Sectors Those from the military and political circles in Shanghai who rushed to the North Station yesterday morning to welcome him included Mayor Wu Tiecheng, Lin Jin (representative of Garrison Commander Dai Ji), Yang Hu (Director of the Security Department), Wen Hongen (Director of the Public Security Bureau), Chen Jianru (representative of Central Committee member Sun Zhesheng), Chen Boquan (eldest son and representative of Chen Tiaoyuan), Chen Qicai, Du Yuesheng, Zhang Xiaolin, Wang Yiting, and others. Representatives from various organizations included Wang Xiaolai and Yu Qiaqing from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Hu Bijiang, Lu Xuepu, and Chen Zheqing from the banking sector, and Duan's old friends Ye Gongchao, Zhang Shizhao, Zheng Hanxiang, Li Sihao, Liang Hongzhi, He Qigong, Chu Huiseng, Fei Baoyan, Tan Daonan, representatives from the Anhui Shanghai Association, Luzhou Association, Satin Trade Association, and Gan Ningqing and citizen representative Zhang Qinghua, who flew to Shanghai from Nanjing, totaling two hundred people. The Municipal Government also sent a military band to play music at the platform to welcome him, creating a very enthusiastic atmosphere.</p>

<p>Duan is Energetic Duan was traveling in a special carriage attached to the Beijing-Shanghai overnight express train. He arrived at the station at exactly 8:02 a.m. Those who came to welcome him boarded the carriage to greet him. Xu Shiying, who accompanied him to Shanghai, introduced them one by one. Duan shook hands and thanked them repeatedly. Then, supported by Wu Guangxin and Xu Shiying, he disembarked and boarded the car that had been prepared on the platform. Amid the lively music of the military band, he drove directly to the World Academy Residence at No. 383 Fooking Road to rest. Hundreds of people stood on both sides of the North Station to admire Duan's demeanor. Duan is now sixty-nine years old and has graying hair, but he is energetic and walks as normally. When he arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning, Duan wore a dark wool hat, an otter collar coat, a blue silk fur robe, and a black satin jacket. Although old, his heroic spirit is still undiminished. Duan lives a simple life, getting up at 6 a.m. every morning to chant scriptures for two hours. He also goes to bed early and chants scriptures for two hours before going to sleep. Those who came to Shanghai with Duan yesterday included Wu Guangxin, Wei Zonghan, Duan's nephew Honggang, Duan's nephew Chen Xiangfu, Zhong Bojie, and Xu Shiying and Zhang Qun, specially dispatched by the Central Government to accompany him to Shanghai, totaling eight people.</p>
<p>Duan Speaks to Reporters After arriving at the World Academy, Duan went to the guest room on the second floor to rest. He was then introduced by Xu Shiying to meet with reporters from various newspapers. Duan stood up and spoke first, saying that he was old, had been in retirement for many years, had not read newspapers for a long time, and was completely a commoner, not involved in national affairs. This trip south was to visit his younger sister in Nanjing and his second daughter in Shanghai. He was grateful for the warm reception he received from the authorities in Nanjing. As for his opinions on saving the country, he had contributed them to the Central Government to the best of his ability for consideration. He now plans to stay in Shanghai for a while and then travel to Hangzhou when the weather warms up, immersing himself in the famous mountains and appreciating the beauty of the mountains and rivers. When asked about the North China issue by a reporter from this newspaper, Duan replied that the Japanese had reached a point where they were impervious to reason or emotion. The only way for our country to respond is for everyone to be united and work together for self-salvation. As the saying goes, it is better to seek help from oneself than from others. If the whole country is actively prepared and works together, then even ten Japan's would not be fearsome. Our country is facing the consequences of its lack of preparation. Duan concluded with an impassioned speech, saying that patriotism is shared by all and that the only way to save the country is through self-salvation.</p>
<p>Important Figures Visit Yesterday morning at 10 a.m., Duan first met with Sun Ke, President of the Legislative Yuan, followed by Dai Ji, Garrison Commander of Songhu, Ye Gongchao, Qian Xinzhi, Zhang Shizhao, Yang Shuzhan, Huang Yingbai, and others. Those who visited in the afternoon included Wang Zhengting, Wu Tiyun, Zhang Ji, Fu Zongyao, Deng Hanxiang, Yu Jiegao, Zhang Ming, Wei Zongxin, Li Liejun, Yang Yongtai, Cheng Qian, and others.</p>
<p>Wu and Sun Host Banquets Mayor Wu Tiecheng hosted a banquet at the World Academy yesterday noon to welcome Duan. Important figures from Shanghai were invited to accompany him. At approximately 7 p.m., he attended a banquet hosted by Sun Zhesheng, President of the Legislative Yuan. Many other invitations were declined. In addition, various organizations, such as the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Shanghai Local Association, the Taxpayers Association, the French Concession Taxpayers Association, the Citizens Federation, the Anti-Civil War League, the Aviation Association, the Northeast Refugee Relief Association, the Volunteer Army Support Association, the Bar Association, the Accountants Association, the General Labor Union, the Education Association, the Zhejiang Provincial Association, and the Exchange Federation, have jointly scheduled a reception at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce at 12 noon on the 27th. On the same afternoon, Chu Minyi, Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan, will host a reception at his residence to welcome Duan.</p>
<p>Duan Has One Son and Four Daughters Duan has one son and four daughters. His son, Hongye, manages the family affairs in Tianjin and will come to Shanghai soon to serve him. His eldest daughter, Shibin, is married to Zhang Daohong, who works at the Salt Affairs Office in Hankou. His second daughter, Wuquan, is married to Fu Lin and currently lives in Shanghai. She is slightly ill. Fu is a student who studied in the United States and once served as Xu Shiying's secretary. His third daughter is married to a nephew of Yuan Shikai and lives in their ancestral home in Henan. His youngest daughter is married to Xi Lun and lives in Qingdao. Duan Honggang, who came with him, is Duan's younger nephew.</p>
<p>First Visit to Shanghai Since the Republic Xu Shiying told reporters yesterday that Duan plans to stay in Shanghai for a while, and his trip to Hangzhou and other places will be postponed until the weather warms up. He recalled that Duan came to Shanghai once after returning to China from Germany in the 29th year of the Guangxu reign. This is the second time, with a gap of more than thirty years. In the sixth year of the Republic, he visited Nanjing once, which was also more than a decade ago.</p>
<p>Wu Guangxin Clarifies Rumors Regarding Duan's visit to the south, it was rumored yesterday that Duan's trip was to suggest direct negotiations between China and Japan to the Central Government. When interviewed by reporters yesterday, Wu Guangxin said that the Japanese rumors are not worth refuting. Duan's character and his history, such as the Constitutional Protection Movement, the campaign against the restoration of the monarchy, and the participation in World War I, prove his integrity. This trip south is to contribute his opinions to the Central Government for their consideration. Duan himself has no preconceived notions.</p>
<h3 id="e102">Aviation to Save the Nation Propaganda Week, Day Two <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>Expressions of Deep Sorrow from All Sectors</p>
<p>Dahua Company Broadcasts Yesterday</p>
<p>The Aviation to Save the Nation Propaganda Week for all sectors in this city was yesterday, the second day. It was originally scheduled for Shi Liangcai and Jiang Huaisu to broadcast speeches. Later, Mr. Shi rescheduled due to personal matters, but Mr. Jiang still arrived at the Dahua Company as scheduled to broadcast. The following is a brief record of his speech:</p>
<p>Jiang Huaisu's Speech</p>
<p>Regarding the significance of the Aviation to Save the Nation Propaganda Week, Mayor Wu has already spoken about it yesterday, and everyone probably already understands. Since the September 18th Incident, "Resist Japan and Save the Nation" can be said to be the unanimous call of the entire populace. However, to see results, there must be a concrete plan. First, we must examine the true facts. Currently, China has a large army, and their morale is also very good, but there has not been substantial progress in national defense. The tools for "Resisting Japan and Saving the Nation" have not been actively replenished. Relying solely on bare hands to fight the enemy will inevitably lead to failure. Among the tools for "Resisting Japan and Saving the Nation," the most important is, of course, airplanes. Mayor Wu said, "In the future, the air force will be the main force in determining victory or defeat." This is very meaningful. During the January 28th Incident last year, although we had the loyal and brave 19th Route Army and the 5th Army, sacrificing blood and flesh to defend our homeland, we suffered significant losses due to the lack of air force support. Just look at the scorched earth of Zhabei and Jiangwan. What should be our feelings? After the January 28th Incident, everyone knew the importance of the air force. Because China's science is backward, we cannot build our own, and the central government's finances are difficult, making it impossible to purchase them, so the strength of the air force simply cannot be strengthened. However, if we have the determination, we should do our best to provide proper assistance to the central government, economic assistance. There are three types of combat aircraft: reconnaissance, bomber, and fighter. Each one costs an average of about 150,000 yuan. This price seems very high, but if we calculate the total losses of the January 28th Incident, it was 150 million yuan, which could have bought 10,000 airplanes. If China had 10,000 airplanes to build its air force and strengthen its national defense, not only would the January 28th Incident in Shanghai not have happened, but perhaps the three northeastern provinces would still be in our hands. France, with the largest air force in the world, has more than 6,000 airplanes. Even small Japan has more than 2,000. Only we in China cannot even give a number, which is very distressing. Now that we have the unanimous determination to "Resist Japan and Save the Nation," we should do our best to help the government build the air force. We must know that "Resisting Japan and Saving the Nation" is not just the government's responsibility, but also the responsibility of our people. "The rise and fall of the nation is the responsibility of every citizen." That is the meaning. Now, Shanghai has the organization of the Aviation Association. The membership fee is two yuan per person, and all the membership fee income will be used to purchase combat airplanes. We hope that the results of this movement, from the "January 28th" airplane to the "Shanghai" airplane, to the "Shanghai Merchant" airplane, to the "Shanghai Worker" airplane, and so on, will continue to rise up. The other day, the Municipal Education Association decided to raise funds to donate the "Shanghai School No. 1" airplane. This small amount is not enough to save the nation. We deeply hope that those with wealth will make large donations. Complete our mission in the near future, otherwise, if the violent Japanese invade Shanghai again, we may not even have the opportunity to pledge donations.</p>
<p>Aviation Association Finds a Location</p>
<p>At 4:00 PM on the 22nd of this month, the Chinese Aviation Association, in order to expand publicity, invited people from all walks of life to the YMCA of the Eight Immortals Bridge, including Central Supervisory Committee member Wu Zhihui and over a hundred others. Chairman Shi Liangcai immediately decided that all attendees would join the association. The Chinese Aviation Association has now found a location at 99 Avenue Joffre to be its headquarters and is actively making arrangements, planning to move in and officially begin operations on February 1st. They will also expand their solicitation of members. The following are the speeches given on that day by Chairman Shi Liangcai, Lin Wojiang, Wu Zhihui, Xue Dubi, Chu Minyi, Mayor Wu, and others:</p>
<p>Shi Liangcai's Speech</p>
<p>Briefly stated, "Our association invited people from all walks of life today to hold this tea party. We are grateful for the gracious attendance of people from all sectors. The significance of our association calling this meeting today is that aviation to save the nation is a matter of utmost urgency today, but how should aviation be planned and developed to achieve the goal of saving the nation? This requires collective wisdom and joint discussion. We earnestly hope that all of you present today will express your opinions to guide us. We still feel indignant when we recall the tragedy of the Japanese airplanes bombing us on January 28th. In the future, we should regard aviation as our second life, quickly catch up, and aim to protect our lives and property so that those bullies have nowhere to use their skills. At the beginning of the establishment of our association, the urgent task is how to raise funds to purchase airplanes. We hope that all sectors will actively assist. It is also very important to consider what use we should make of the airplanes after we purchase them to implement our original intention. Originally, the reason why we spare no effort or expense to seek the development of aviation is to consolidate national defense. There is concern that the airplanes we painstakingly obtain may be used for internal purposes. This is an overthought. In fact, as the national crisis becomes more urgent, anyone with a conscience should work hard to save the nation. There is absolutely no such thing as internal affairs. There is only unity against external enemies, so as not to become sinners of the nation. This is what our association should seriously declare and pay attention to. Now, Mayor Wu has strongly advocated that all staff members of the municipal government, from policemen to security guards, and soldiers, should join our association at the same time. We hope that all of you present today will also join our association, and at any time and place, disseminate information to all sectors to make the people understand the importance of aviation and jointly join our association to work hard. The future of our association really depends on it. Regarding the establishment process of our association, I now invite Mr. Lin Wojiang to report to everyone."</p>
<p>Lin Wojiang's Report</p>
<p>Briefly stated, "Since the 'September 18th' Incident in Shenyang and the 'January 28th' Battle of Songhu, the people of the country have realized the importance of air defense. Party headquarters, local groups, and overseas Chinese have submitted petitions to the National Government, requesting the organization of an Aviation to Save the Nation Association to allow the public to work together to save the nation. The National Government sent this type of report to the Ministry of Military Affairs and the Political Department, which transferred it to the Aviation Administration, summarized the opinions from all parties, and drafted measures. Later, the Aviation Administration sent me, Wojiang, to Shanghai to contact leaders from all sectors. The leaders enthusiastically supported this, and the preparations for the Aviation to Save the Nation Association began. Subsequently, the National Government appointed Mr. Wang Xiaolai and twenty-one others as directors of our association, and Mayor Wu strongly supported us. Our association was officially established on the first of this month. Moreover, because aviation national defense must be sustained for a long time, the name 'Aviation to Save the Nation Association' implies a temporary response, which seems inappropriate. After the government entrusted this idea to Mayor Wu and the preparatory members for consultation, the name was changed to 'Chinese Aviation Association.' This is a general overview of the establishment of our association."</p>
<p>Wu Zhihui's Speech</p>
<p>"Just listening to Mr. Shi Liangcai's speech has moved me very much. Since the Jiawu War, after Japan taught us a lesson, there has been a slogan for saving the nation for almost forty years. Last year, on January 28th, we were taught another lesson. Some people say that if people fight against each other, they must first fight against things before they can fight against people. I used to say that motors save the nation, and aviation uses motors. Now, the purpose of establishing the Chinese Aviation Association is the same as my motor to save the nation doctrine, so I very much agree with it. We must make sure that everyone has motor thinking in their minds in order to like research. There will also be more talents, and science will flourish. Do not say that I am an amateur and ignore it. You must know that everything always starts with amateurs becoming professionals. When everyone becomes a professional, then you can fight against others. You must not embrace non-resistance and then have others teach you a lesson. It is too late. If the 400 million people in our country talk about raising funds, it is really like a drop in the bucket, but some people say that the people are extremely poor and cannot afford it. You should know that even if the cow is thin, this hair is easy to pull out, so I advise the people of the country to first change this way of thinking, hurry up and cultivate talents, and everyone use the motor to save the nation doctrine. This is developing aviation to save the nation."</p>
<p>Xue Dubi's Speech</p>
<p>Briefly stated, "Your association is named the Aviation Association. I would just like to speak on the word 'Association.' There is a Chinese proverb that says, 'One tree cannot support a tall building.' Another proverb says, 'United will is an impregnable stronghold.' The former means that holding on alone weakens the momentum, while the latter means that the crowd makes things easy to lift. For decades, our country has been invaded because tens of thousands of people and tens of thousands of minds could not unite and cooperate. Now, seeing the establishment of your association, it is due to the joint efforts of the government and public organizations. This is enough to prove that the government and the public have the greatest awareness and thoroughly understand the need to work together to resist the enemy. From now on, I hope that this one word of sincerity will break the current crisis facing our country."</p>
<p>Chu Minyi's Speech</p>
<p>"Just now, Mr. Wu Zhihui spoke about the method of the Chinese Aviation Association raising funds, which is very easy, but there must be a centralized method, or each group donates one airplane, or each individual donates one airplane. The whole country should quickly establish branches and proceed in a unified manner, with each person soliciting individually. The more the better, naturally we will be able to achieve the degree that we hope for, and aviation to save the nation can be put into practice."</p>
<p>Wu Tiecheng's Speech</p>
<p>"Just now, Mr. Wu Zhihui said that 'After our country suffered a heavy blow from Japan in the Jiawu War, the people of the country issued a slogan for saving the nation, but almost forty years have passed, and the country has still not been saved, and is even more dangerous. The unexpected arrival of the September 18th Incident the year before last was so overwhelming that there was no way to resist it, which is very painful. We must know that saving the nation must focus on reality, and it is definitely not as effective as the empty words of the past. If we continue in this way, then even if Mr. Wu reaches the age of seventy or eighty, he will still be listening to a lifetime of chaotic talk about saving the nation. What benefit will it have to the actual saving of the nation? The actual work of saving the nation today is to build national defense. Regardless of all sectors of the public, whether they are scholars, farmers, workers, or merchants, they should all make a painful decision and take the construction of national defense as the central undertaking. If they can work hard, then after five or ten years, there will be considerable results to see. Otherwise, if you take individual concepts as the center, there will be no effect. What benefit will it have to the country? The deep wounds and deep pain of the January 28th Incident in Shanghai last year were really beyond the imagination of anyone beforehand. From this, we can see how important air defense is. At present, the power of the air force is greatest in France. The French have said arrogantly that they can destroy the entire city of London in a few minutes. In the past, there were tanks to deal with the army, and submarines to deal with the navy. Now, weapons of murder are becoming more and more powerful. After having air force bombing, it is necessary to have air defense equipment. After we have received the serious lessons of the September 18th Incident and the January 28th Incident, we should thoroughly awaken and take the construction of national defense as the center of all undertakings. However, this matter is important and must be done by the people of the whole country, working together with one heart, in order to succeed. My brother has seen this, so I have advised all staff members of the government, as well as security guards and police officers, etc., numbering in the thousands, to join the Aviation Association as an example. Shanghai has about 3 million people in the entire city. Even if each person pays an ordinary membership fee of two yuan per year, there will be an annual income of 6 million yuan, which can purchase or manufacture dozens of airplanes. The national defense of Russia, France, and Japan all relies on the automatic construction of the people. If our country wants to resist Japan and save the country, why is it any different? Therefore, I hope that all the citizens of Shanghai will join the Aviation Association, and that the entire province and the entire country will be like this. Then our national defense will have a solution, and we will not have to worry about not having a day to seek revenge and avenge our humiliation."</p>
<h3 id="e103">The City Chamber of Commerce Leads the Propaganda <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce leads the city's business community to carry out aviation to save the nation propaganda. It has now been decided that the fifth day of the propaganda week, namely the 27th of this month, will be the business community's propaganda day. It is heard that the City Chamber of Commerce, in addition to issuing a declaration, will also distribute slogans to be posted in shops throughout the city. At the same time, notices will be sent to various trade associations to convene meetings on this day to carry out widespread propaganda. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e104">A Letter to Merchants <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce issued a letter to merchants throughout the city, saying, "The Songhu Anti-Japanese War lasted thirty-four days. The officers and soldiers were loyal to the country, and the citizens provided support for the army. It was not that we did not work together with all our strength to defend Shanghai, but why were the factories reduced to ashes and the city transformed into ruins? More than hundreds of thousands of residents throughout the city suffered losses, all because of the bombings by a few airplanes and the fact that our air defense equipment was non-existent, allowing them to enter unchallenged. When the incident first occurred, merchants generally discussed taking out war insurance to compensate for the losses, but insurance companies consulted their headquarters, worried that the risk was too great, and all refused to underwrite. Therefore, very few people had war insurance during this battle, and the unexpected losses were irreparable. This is probably the most unforgettable thing for our merchants. As the saying goes, 'It is better to ask oneself than to ask others.' It is better to prepare for a rainy day than to dig a well when thirsty. Today, if a country wants to stand in the world, a prosperous city must first have air defense equipment to deal with emergencies. Moreover, the situation in our country is like a bird's nest on a dangerous curtain, constantly facing the possibility of being attacked. We should not be slack and unprepared. Now, the price of combat airplanes is about 100,000 yuan each. Public funds are tight, and although there are annual purchases, it is not easy to become a spectacle. If the merchants do not raise funds and donate them, then our country's fledgling air force will remain immature forever. If something happens one day, how can we defeat the enemy? During the Songhu battle, the Japanese airplanes gathered at the front line, including both naval and military aircraft, totaled only one hundred or so, according to the newspapers at the time. If our merchants can raise 20 million yuan, we can purchase 200 airplanes. Although we dare not say that we can dominate the airspace, we can consolidate Shanghai's defenses. This 20 million yuan is only one-tenth of the losses from the Shanghai war. The international situation is becoming increasingly dangerous, and future wars, relying on the renewal of their weapons, will only tend towards expansion. If we continue to delay, then the losses in the future may be ten or a hundred times more than after the Songhu battle. Once this opportunity is lost, it will be too late to regret it. Therefore, to put it bluntly, the people's cry for aviation to save the nation can be said to be the only way for merchants to save themselves, and its effect is a million times better than war insurance. Only when our merchants rise up together can we achieve it."</p>

<p>Yesterday, the association sent letters to various trade associations and the Citizens' Federation throughout the city, distributing aviation to save the nation slogans and forwarding them to various stores to be posted inside glass windows from today onwards, in order to arouse the public's enthusiasm for aviation to save the nation.</p>
<h3 id="e106">Gathering of Executive and Supervisory Committees <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>The City Chamber of Commerce notified various trade associations that since our country's air force is extremely immature and the national crisis is urgent, it is necessary to reinforce the sheepfold as soon as possible. January 27th has been designated as the business community's propaganda day. It is planned to invite various trade associations to convene industries on this day to publicize aviation to save the nation in order to inspire people's hearts so that the cause of saving the nation can be carried out universally. The association will also convene a joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees in the afternoon to proceed in unison.</p>

<p>One-Two-Eight Frugal Meal Plan</p>
<p>Fly Flags at Half-Mast and Stop Entertainment</p>
<p>The Shanghai Citizens' Federation notified all members yesterday, "The January 28th Bloody Battle is the most tragic history of Songhu. The anniversary is approaching. How can we not feel heartbroken when we recall the hatred of the past? In order to make a profound commemoration and express our condolences, our association has launched a 'Frugal Meal' initiative to transfer funds to help the army, killing two birds with one stone. What could be better? A slogan has been printed, which must be posted at the entrance, and efforts must be made to publicize the frugal meal donation. Our association has sent a letter to the Bankers' Association to forward it to member banks, and to establish a separate item for collecting 'frugal meal donations' in the donation book for the Northeast Volunteer Army. We hope that you will quickly calculate the population and how much should be donated, generously help as much as possible, and send it directly to major banks. This matter concerns saving the nation and is a matter of urgency. Please do not be indifferent. Please fly the flag at half-mast and stop entertainment on this day, and reflect on the pain while eating frugally. We hope that you will take care of it."</p>
<p>Another letter to the Bankers' Association states, "Respectfully, it has been one year since the Japanese army bombed Songhu. Our association has launched a frugal meal to help the army in response to the needs of the Northeast Volunteer Army. We have long admired your association's patriotic enthusiasm, and we have always been brave in doing so. We deeply admire you. The funds for this frugal meal have been sent to members, and all frugal meal donations will be sent directly to major banks for collection. We hope that your association will inform member banks and establish a separate item for 'frugal meal donations' in the donation book for the Northeast Volunteer Army, which can be used for statistics in the future. This is a matter of saving the nation, and we hope that you will agree with it. We hope that your association will forward it to colleagues in the banking industry to encourage them to eat frugally and help the army, thereby setting an example for merchants. We are deeply grateful. We hope that you will check and handle it."</p>
<h3 id="e109">The Antique Dealers Association Supports Frugal Meals to Help the Army <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Antique Dealers Association and other trade associations support the January 28th Commemorative Frugal Meal to Help the Army. Yesterday, they specially sent a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to lead and promote it, and notified member stores to handle it. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce states, "Respectfully, the Japanese army's invasion on January 28th opened up a tragic record that has never been seen before. Time flies like a shuttle, and the anniversary has arrived. A commemoration of this kind of extraordinary humiliation should be expressed in an essential way. For example, advocating frugal meals is also a unique way to commemorate it, and it is intended to remind the people to be vigilant while eating less, and to think of the glorious anti-Japanese volunteer army of the Chinese nation, which is fighting in the icy and snowy land for a long time, so that everyone can do their best to contribute to our sacred and beloved anti-Japanese armies. At this time when commerce is depressed and merchants are deeply stimulated, their righteous indignation fills their chests, and everyone wants to kill the enemy to save the situation. The merchants of our country, those who are loyal and patriotic, certainly have the idea that their heads can be cut off, but their will cannot be moved. They originally wanted to vigorously promote domestic goods to control enemy goods in order to wipe out the shame, but some ruthless and ungrateful merchants who sell enemy goods, change their brands or add embellishments, only use the slogan of domestic goods to make ten times the profit, only care about profit, and put patriotic ideas behind their heads. Their crime is unforgivable. Your association is the leading group of merchants in this city. Punishing evil and promoting righteousness to show the determination to save the nation is what our association deeply prays for. At this time when Yuguan has fallen and Rehe is in danger, we can only economize on food and clothing and transfer funds to help the army. Therefore, we will hold the first event on January 28th. Please notify all industries in the city in the spirit of striving to save the nation to implement it uniformly in order to achieve the effect of easy success. The operation of our industry is based on the market as the standard. Since the January 28th Incident, it has not been easy to maintain business. Other industries can eat rice, but our industry can only eat porridge. At this time when the country is in trouble, although our industry is suffering infinitely, how dare we lag behind in our patriotism? We are now advocating frugal meals to help the army. Even the money for eating porridge should be transferred to the bank and remitted to the Northeast. This concerns patriotism and commemoration. We hope that everyone will abide by it. We also attach slogans such as Aviation to Save the Nation, which we hope will be posted for publicity. Please handle it.</p>
<p>Advice to Members states, "Notice: Japan is destroying East Asian peace and implementing a continental aggression policy, taking an inch and wanting a mile, making progress step by step. All six countries are righteously indignant. The Songhu bloody battle of January 28th last year bombed and destroyed tens of millions of our essence, resulting in a sharp decline in commerce. Our antique industry, with its special circumstances, has been transferred from the market. Since suffering from the January 28th trauma, it has not been easy to maintain business. Other industries can eat rice, but our industry can only eat porridge. At this time when the country is in trouble, although our industry has suffered infinitely, how dare we lag behind in our patriotism? We are now advocating frugal meals to help the army, which will be held on the January 28th Commemorative Day. Even the money for eating porridge should be transferred to the bank and remitted to the Northeast. This concerns patriotism and commemoration. We hope that everyone will abide by it. Also attached are slogans such as Aviation to Save the Nation, which we hope will be posted for publicity. Please handle it."</p>

<p>The General Assembly of the Great Alliance to Abolish Internal War telegraphically sent messages to the Central Government and the Executive Yuan yesterday, saying, "The Nanjing National Government Military Affairs Commission, Executive Yuan, and Ministry of Military Affairs: Although the Sichuan War has ended, the Guizhou rebellion has not yet stopped. Recently, members of the Guizhou Association in Shanghai reported that the war in the province is still ongoing between Guiyang and Longli, and the conflict has not been resolved. It is not known that the heavy army once occupied Tuyunguan, but was repelled by You's troops. Now Wang Jialie is contacting the troops of Wang Zhongyun and You Yujiu to besiege Anshun, and is still using artillery to bombard the city. The people have been greatly harmed, and the local rice has increased to 25 yuan per stone. We cannot help but feel compassion. We beg your government, your Yuan, and your ministry not to forget the remote areas, and quickly send strict telegrams ordering both sides to immediately stop military action, and send senior officials to handle Guizhou affairs, and implement partition governance to save the people from their suffering. We eagerly await your response. The Great Alliance to Abolish Internal War, General Assembly, respectfully."</p>

I hope you will give me your opinions to correct my shortcomings. I send a special reply and wish you well. Wu Peifu pays respects, January 10."</p>

<h3 id="e116">Miao Zhongxiu Discusses China's Silk Industry <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>Since being affected by the global economic downturn, China's silk industry has gradually declined, leading to the closure of silk factories in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, and the unemployment of workers, accumulating to tens of thousands. The impact not only affects the silk industry itself but is also the most pressing economic problem for our country today. Yesterday, a reporter specifically visited Mr. Zhongxiu, the Director of the Raw Silk Inspection Department of the Commodity Inspection Bureau of the Ministry of Industry. According to him, last year's exports of Shanghai raw silk totaled 40,513 bales (including 17,847 bales of Jiangsu-Zhejiang factory silk), a decrease of 21,430 bales compared to 1931, a decrease of 34,542 bales compared to 1930, and an even greater decrease of 74,217 bales compared to 1929. Guangzhou's exports last year totaled approximately 31,870 bales (estimated 2,000 bales in December), a decrease of 14,700 bales compared to 1931 and a decrease of 28,600 bales compared to 1920. Compared to 1929, the decrease was 32,360 bales. The disastrous decline in China's raw silk foreign trade is as described above. However, Japan's raw silk exports last year totaled approximately 545,521 bales (estimated 50,000 bales in December), a decrease of only 8,077 bales compared to 1931, but an increase of 71,641 bales compared to 1930. In terms of US consumption, last year's usage of Japanese silk was 518,794 bales, not only not decreasing compared to 1911 but actually increasing by 13,014 bales. Consumption of Chinese silk was only 22,047 bales, a decrease of 44,118 bales compared to 1931. From this, it can be seen that China's silk industry, after being hit by the global economic downturn, has continued to decline, while Japan, since 1920, has been making vigorous progress and has restored its inherent prosperity. This is based on the cooperation of all levels of society in Japan, but also due to the preparations of the silk industry itself. What is this preparation? It is the scientific and rationalization of the entire silk industry. This preparation cannot be achieved in a day or two, nor can it be created by the efforts of one party. It is the result of decades of cooperation between the government, merchants, and experts. The biggest shortcoming of China's silk industry is that there is too little silk of the same grade. Jiangsu-Zhejiang factory silk has some that are above 90 points and some that are below 70 points. The production is small, and the grades are complicated. What the United States needs is a large quantity of raw silk of the same grade, which is the opposite of the production situation of Chinese raw silk. It is enough to see that the sales of Chinese silk in the United States are decreasing daily. It is hoped that the government will actively promote it, merchants will work hard, and use the wisdom of experts. With the joint cooperation of these three forces, China's silk industry may have hope.</p>

<p>The Municipal Council Abandons its Claim of Consent</p>
<p>The Chinese Taxpayers' Association Expresses Gratitude</p>
<p>The Shanghai Concession Chinese Taxpayers' Association sent a letter to the Municipal Government yesterday, stating, "In response to your government's Public Letter No. 1435, regarding the US Consul General's letter on the addition of two Chinese members to the Land Committee, our leading consul sent a proposal to the Municipal Council on July 27th and approved it in the large letter of October 13th. The letter from the Chinese Taxpayers' Association expressed opposition to the proposal that the selection of the two Chinese members in the proposal should be subject to the consent of the Municipal Council and the Chinese Taxpayers' Association, and the Municipal Council and the Chinese Property Owners' Association. The opinions stated by the Association are very sincere, and their claims are extremely reasonable, etc. The Municipal Council has been requested to consider these opinions. Now, we have received a letter from the Director of the Municipal Council, stating that after further consideration, the Municipal Council believes that the resolution of the last Western Taxpayers' Annual Meeting can be implemented if item (A) is retained. Item A was included in the letter sent to the Western Chinese on July 27th, namely (A. One of the two newly added Chinese members of the Land Committee must be appointed by the Chinese Taxpayers' Association, and the appointee must not be a property owner or representative of property owners; the other member shall be appointed by the Chinese Property Owners' Association), etc. If the Chinese members are appointed separately by the Taxpayers' Association and the Property Owners' Association as per the above method, the Municipal Council is quite willing to withdraw the limitation stated in item (B) of the previous letter, which requires the consent of the Municipal Council. However, as stated in the Taxpayers' Association's letter relayed in the letter of October 13th, the Municipal Council has already answered the wishes of the Taxpayers' Association. It is hoped that your Mayor will provide written confirmation agreeing to the revised proposal of the Municipal Council. If there is a need to change the Yangjingbang Regulations, we can present our opinions to the Diplomatic Corps. We are sending this letter for your reference and reply. We are doing this, etc. We have received this, and this case was previously reported to us. Now, we have received the previous report and are sending this letter to you for your reference, hoping to receive your reply. We find that the Shanghai Public Concession Municipal Council is quite willing to withdraw the limitation stated in item (B) of the previous letter, which requires the consent of the Municipal Council. Regarding the selection of Chinese members of the Land Committee, our Association expresses our gratitude for the fairness of the Council's treatment of this case. As for the amendment of the Yangjingbang Regulations, since there is a precedent for the Council to join and increase the number of Chinese Directors, we should request your government to submit it to the National Government for approval, and have the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the representatives of the relevant countries confirm it by diplomatic note. We are sending this letter for your review and implementation, and we hope for your continued friendship. This is addressed to Mayor Wu of the Shanghai Municipal Government."</p>

<p>Gu Lanji, a member of the Shanghai Real Estate Association and a rental agent, sent a letter to the Shanghai Real Estate Association yesterday, stating, "Since the water dispute occurred, it has been several months, and it is still unresolved. I am now copying the water bills for December of last year, selecting those with significant differences, as follows: (Monthly water included) Wuzhou Road, Wuling Village, 106 yuan, 3 jiao, 3 fen; Wuzhou Road, 73 yuan, 7 jiao, 4 fen; Disiwei Road, Lanwei Lane, 73 yuan, 6 jiao, 4 fen; (Water meter readings) Wuzhou Road, Wuling Village, 319 yuan, 7 jiao, 5 fen; Wuzhou Road, 402 yuan, 5 jiao; Disiwei Road, Lanwei Lane, 251 yuan, 5 jiao, 6 fen. Comparing the above figures, the first increase is close to threefold, the second increase is close to sixfold, and the fourth increase is close to fourfold. Such a method is really beyond the ability of landlords to bear. Now I am reporting the recent facts to your association to provide reference materials and also to understand the truth. As for the progress of your association's negotiations with the water company and what the future holds, I also hope to be informed in detail." The Association immediately replied, "In response to your letter of January 17th regarding the water bill situation calculated by meter, we have received all the information. What we can tell you now is that before a solution is reached, the water bill can be paid informally at the old price, and the three parties will also consult. We are sending this letter for your information."</p>

<p>The Bureau of Social Affairs Plans to Start Work Next Month</p>
<p>The Concession Authorities' Handling Does Not Comply with Regulations</p>
<p>There are many factories in this city. The management and inspection of all factories have been actively carried out by the Bureau of Social Affairs, which is in charge of these matters in this city. The inspection of various factories opened in the Chinese area will be completed within the month. The planning and implementation of the inspection of various factories opened in the Concession is also underway. However, it was reported in the newspaper the day before yesterday that Mr. Fessenden, Director of the Shanghai Public Concession Municipal Council, will propose at the special meeting of taxpayers to be held in April to amend Article 34 of the attached rules of the Yangjingbang Regulations so that the Concession authorities have the power to manage and inspect factories within the Concession and has hired Ms. Cynthia to handle industrial matters. However, if this matter is implemented, it will inevitably conflict with the policies of the Chinese government. A reporter from the Central News Agency specifically visited the person in charge of the Bureau of Social Affairs about this matter. According to him, the municipal government has already formulated a complete plan for factory inspection. The inspection work in the Chinese area has come to an end. As for the Concession area, it is planned to start work next month. It is heard that the current handling of factory inspection matters within the Concession by the Public Concession is inconsistent with the provisions in the Yangjingbang Regulations. If obstacles arise in the progress of the Bureau's factory inspection work in the Concession in the future, the municipal government will submit a negotiation to the Concession Bureau.</p>
<h3 id="e121">Yu Qiaqing's Mediation of the Wusong Ship Case Yields No Results <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>The Company's Attitude is Strong, Yu is Hesitant to Go Again</p>
<p>The Coordination Association Shelves the Matter Temporarily Due to Difficult Cooperation Between the Two Parties</p>
<p>Regarding the case of the Wusong Ship expelling workers, Chinese Director Yu Qiaqing negotiated with the company's manager yesterday, but there were no results due to the company's firm attitude. Whether the Coordination Association will be established is still undecided. Details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Support Meeting. The support meeting for the Wusong Ship tragedy was held at 2:15 PM yesterday at the Zhongcang Guild Hall at No. 36 Jiuxiaochang Road. Thirty-nine representatives from various ships attended. Chuan Xiaoting chaired the meeting, and the following resolutions were passed: (1) It is proposed to request the Party and government authorities to continue mediation. (2) If this case is not resolved in the near future, it is decided to send personnel to Beijing to petition the Central Party Headquarters. (3) For the two sailors, Ma Qiaogen and Wu Ruiqing, who were arrested and escorted to Shanghai, apart from Ma, who has been released, the authorities will try to rescue Wu and release him.</p>
<p>Uncertain Resumption of Work. Wei Biansheng, a clerk recruited by the donation department of the Wusong Ship Tragedy Support Association, told a reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency yesterday that it is currently difficult to predict whether this case can be resolved immediately. The anger of the workers is inevitable. However, with the supervision of the various committee members, no out-of-bounds actions will occur. All ships have given their sympathetic assistance, which is very appreciated. The company's firm attitude, it is thought that justice will never be bent to its will. As for whether Chinese Director Yu Qiaqing will go to negotiate today (i.e., yesterday), no notice has been received from Mr. Yu. There are outside rumors that Zhang Xianming, the newly appointed compradore of the Wusong Ship, sent personnel to negotiate the resumption of work and that there will be a full resumption of work after three shifts, but these are not true.</p>
<p>Association Not Established. Initially, it was proposed that the Mutual Aid Association and the Zhongcang workers jointly form a Coordination Association. The Mutual Aid Association had requested the prior release of the compradore Jing Chunhua and accountant Hu Henian, who were arrested in Hankou, as a condition for cooperation. After investigation, it was found that Hu and the others were still bailed out by the Mutual Aid Association themselves. The Party and government authorities were concerned that the Mutual Aid Association would not be able to cooperate, so they started discussions at the Seafarers' Special Party Headquarters at 3:00 PM yesterday. Wang Xianqing, Director of the Mediation Section of the Bureau of Social Affairs, Zhou Lianze, Chief Executive of the People's Training Section representing the Municipal Party Headquarters, Yu Jiayong, Standing Member of the Seafarers' Party Headquarters, and Secretary Xu Shiqi attended. According to Xu Shiqi's remarks to a reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency, whether the Coordination Association is established depends on whether the labor and management can cooperate. If the association is established but the opinions are different, then the establishment of this association is worthless. Therefore, it is difficult to announce whether it will be established now. In short, the Party and government authorities are still entrusting the Mutual Aid Association to be responsible for mediation.</p>
<p>Mediation Hopeless. According to Chinese Director Yu Qiaqing, the labor and management in the Wusong Ship case entrusted mediation last time. The meeting was not held because the Taikoo manager was away from home the day before yesterday. At 10:00 AM yesterday, Mr. Yu went to meet with the manager, Hote (transliteration). After a long conversation, the manager's attitude was very firm, and there was no room for mediation. The manager also said that the dismissal of the tea servers was for the convenience of the passengers. The Wusong Ship now only employs more than 30 Western waiters. In the future, the name "tea server" may be abolished. Among the tea servers on each ship, some are good, but many are bad, etc. It is heard that Mr. Yu said that the company's attitude is so strong that the future is hopeless, so he expressed that he has no intention of serving as a mediator again.</p>

<p>The Opinions, etc., were submitted to the next Board of Directors meeting for remedy.</p>
<p>The Labor Union Resolved to Stop Petitioning and Await a Solution</p>
<p>Yesterday, the laid-off employees of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company petitioned the Board of Directors again. Directors Du Yuesheng and Yang Zhixiong received them and promised to submit the written opinions to the Board of Directors meeting on February 2 for review and to take responsibility for resolving them. They also advised them to maintain order. Details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Petition Again. After the disturbance caused by the petition the day before yesterday, the laid-off employees resolved at a general meeting that evening to petition the Board of Directors again at 11:30 AM yesterday, led by union representatives Yu Xianting, Chen Shijun, Xue Yinda, Xue Xingbiao, Li Angqing, Fu Zhiyang, Shan Xishou, etc., together with all the laid-off employees, requesting reinstatement or, if not, severance pay for one year and stating their opinions. After receiving the report, the general patrol room of the Public Concession immediately sent Chinese and foreign detectives to maintain order.</p>
<p>The Directors' Reply. Standing Director Du Yuesheng and Director Yang Zhixiong ordered the union to nominate representatives to meet. Yu Xianting, Fu Zhiyang, Bei Xichou, and others were then nominated to pay their respects and state their reasons. Du Yuesheng and others then replied that they would submit the written opinions to the eleventh meeting of the Board of Directors at 4:00 PM on February 2 for discussion and then decide on a fair remedy. As for increasing severance pay, a concrete solution has now been agreed upon and will be announced after being approved by the Board of Directors. Directors Du and Yang will be responsible for resolving the matter. They dispersed at 12:30 PM.</p>
<p>Decision to Wait. The laid-off employees held a general meeting at the Jinli Wharf Labor Union at 2:00 PM yesterday. Yu Xianting reported on the process and then began discussions, resolving: (1) To accept Director Du Yuesheng's advice, stop continuing to petition, and wait for the reply from the Board of Directors meeting on February 2. (2) If the reply is unsatisfactory at that time, they will decide to hold another general meeting to decide on a final plan. (3) To temporarily refuse to receive two months' severance pay and double pay for December.</p>
<h3 id="e123">Verdi, Director General of the French Municipal Council, Issues a Statement Regarding the Cross-Border Road and Telephone Case <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>According to the Continental News, Verdi, Director General of the French Municipal Council, stated the truth to a reporter from this newspaper yesterday (23rd) because of a report that Chen, the Chief of the Shanghai Public Utilities Bureau, said that the cross-border road construction and telephone case was delayed due to the sudden objection from the French Concession authorities. Verdi said that the French Concession Public Works Bureau had long agreed to the terms of the contract completely, but disagreed with the implementation method set by the Public Concession Municipal Council. Although the contract has not been signed, the representatives of the Shanghai Telephone Company, the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau, and the two Concession authorities have all agreed. At this time, the unresolved dispute lies only in the implementation aspect. The contract stipulates that the Shanghai Telephone Bureau will be reimbursed 60 yuan per telephone installed along the roads built across the border in the northern district each year and 12 yuan per telephone installed along the roads built across the border in the western district each year. The Municipal Council proposed that this increased cost be borne by all users, while the French Municipal Council thought that this was one of the inconveniences for those living outside the Concession and should not be borne by users living within the Concession. However, this method of bearing the cost is not stipulated in the contract, so this matter is only a point of contention between the two Concession authorities and is unrelated to the contract itself. Now, the Municipal Council proposes that all users bear this cost for only one year. If there are similar burdens in the future, they will be borne by users living outside the Concession. After the telephone company solves this case, the increased income may make it possible for the company to appropriately reduce telephone charges after one year. Therefore, the French Concession authorities are not very persistent now and may agree to this temporary measure. This matter will be submitted for discussion at the regular meeting of the Board of Directors of the French Municipal Council next Monday. If it is agreed, the cross-border road construction telephone contract can be signed on a scheduled date.</p>

In order to collect widely, Xu Bingxiang, leader of the collection team, team members Xu Wuyan, Chang Baisen, etc., were first sent to Shanghai on the 20th, along with more than one hundred large boxes of goods. They have organized a resident office in the Chinese Arts and Crafts Society and started work. It is also heard that the director of the exhibition is Yu, Director of the Business Department of the Ministry of Railways. Director Yu specifically came to Shanghai on the night train on the 21st and went to the resident office of the exhibition in Shanghai the next morning to inspect for a week. He was very satisfied with all the arrangements and returned to Beijing that night.</p>

All particularly busy circuits between Shanghai and various ports, such as Shanghai-Hankou, Shanghai-Fuzhou, Shanghai-Xiamen, Shanghai-Tianjin, Shanghai-Guangzhou, Shanghai-Qingdao, and Shanghai-Shantou, etc., will soon adopt an automatic transmission and reception system to increase the speed of telegrams. It is expected that the transmission time of each telegram in the future will be no more than three or four minutes. In addition, the method of replacing the recipient's address with a telephone number is now being accelerated in the compilation of the telephone number directory, which will be implemented on February 1. The method of transmitting and receiving telegrams by telephone in the city is also being actively prepared and will be implemented soon. In the future, it will greatly facilitate public communications.</p>

<h3 id="e129">Bravery of Police Officers in Capturing Thieves in an Armed Robbery on Shiqing Road, All Culprits Apprehended <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>Thieves Refuse Arrest from Upstairs, Both Sides Exchange Fire Over 20 Rounds</p>
<p>One Thief Accidentally Shot and Killed by an Accomplice, Succumbs to Severe Wounds</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, a robbery occurred at the residence of Mr. Pan, a native of Huzhou, located at No. 1, Lane 285, Shiqing Road, Zhabei. Pan's eldest daughter seized an opportunity to rush to the local police station to report the incident and request immediate arrest. Patrol Officer Gao Ziqiang led several armed officers to the scene and successfully apprehended three thieves, while one thief died. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Background of the Victim: Mr. Pan, a resident of No. 1, Lane 285, Shiqing Road, Zhabei, resides in a new three-story building. Pan is over sixty years old and has been employed as a credit officer at a silk shop for more than ten years. Diligent and thrifty, he is highly trusted by the shop owner. Pan has two sons and three daughters. His eldest son is married and also works at the silk shop, while his second son works at a silk shop in Xiaodongmen. The family lives harmoniously.</p>
<p>Four Thieves Rob: At 9:30 a.m. yesterday, four robbers dressed in luxurious silk robes suddenly knocked on the side door of Pan's residence. The maid, unaware of their intentions, opened the door and let them in. The robbers falsely claimed to be from the defense corps searching for opium. Two of the robbers brandished pistols to intimidate, while the other two went upstairs to rob. Pan's eldest daughter, Qingfen, seized the opportunity to rush to the Shiqing Road police station to report the incident and request immediate arrest. Patrol Officer Gao Ziqiang, upon receiving the report, immediately led officers Wang Zhejing and Zhao Jinzhong to the scene. They bravely stormed into Pan's residence and forcefully subdued two robbers downstairs, disarming them.</p>
<p>Accidental Killing: As the two robbers were struggling, the two robbers upstairs heard the commotion and, realizing the situation was unfavorable, hid at the top of the stairs and opened fire to resist arrest, putting up a strong defense. Both sides exchanged fire, creating a scene reminiscent of a major battle, with more than twenty rounds fired. As a result, the robbers upstairs accidentally shot one of their accomplices in the head. The bullet entered the left side of his face and exited the back of his head, causing him to fall to the ground immediately, his brains splattered.</p>
<p>Recovered Loot: At that time, more than ten patrol officers from the Fifth District Headquarters, hearing the alarm, rushed to surround the area. Soon, one robber jumped down from the back room and was captured. The police found $100 yuan on his person, and under the bed in the living room, they found</p>
<p>All Culprits Apprehended: One robber was hiding under the bed upstairs. The officers pulled him out by his legs and apprehended him, seizing a pistol and six bullets. In total, the four wounded robbers were taken to the district headquarters. According to their confessions, one robber was named Li Changting, 26 years old, from Haimen, residing at Room 317, Da Zhonghua Hotel, Xizang Road; one robber was named Wang Zailin, 22 years old, from Chongming; and one robber was named Huang Ziwen, 24 years old, from Wuxi, residing at No. 19, Gongping Inn. The wounded robber was unable to speak. According to the three robbers, his name was Xu Afu, from Haimen. District Chief Jin Gong hired workers to take the wounded robber to Baolong Hospital for treatment, but he succumbed to his injuries due to excessive blood loss at around 2:00 p.m. yesterday. The remaining three robbers were sent to the Third Section of the Municipal Public Security Bureau for legal processing.</p>

<p>Suffered Mental Disorder After Wife's Death</p>
<p>Committed Suicide by Poison After Business Closed</p>
<p>Tao Hongshu, a native of Wuxi and an employee of Fuxin Flour Mill in this city, is 36 years old. He has an elderly father over seventy years old and one brother each. His brother, Guanlun, once served as the chief of the public security bureau in Songjiang and Baoying counties. His brother, Xingsheng, is currently employed at a flour mill in Tianjin. Hongshu married a virtuous woman named Zhu. The couple was deeply in love. Last winter, Zhu gave birth to a daughter. However, Zhu contracted an illness after giving birth and, despite medical treatment, died tragically. Since then, Hongshu suffered a mental disorder, often writing in the air and muttering to himself. Unexpectedly, at the end of last year, the Fuxin factory also closed Hongshu's business, further stimulating Hongshu's nerves and leading him to contemplate suicide. He secretly took sedative water at home the night before. After being discovered by his family, he was sent to the hospital for treatment, but it was too late. Before taking the poison, Hongshu wrote several letters, which were left to his elderly father, brothers, and factory employees. The words were sad and touching, unbearable to read.</p>

<p>Commendable Diligence of the Police Detectives</p>
<p>Thieves Should Know to Exercise Restraint</p>
<p>Since the beginning of winter, robberies have been rampant, occurring several times a day. In view of this, Public Concession Police Criminal Division Chief Detectives Lu Liankui and You A'gen issued special instructions to all Chinese detectives in each police station to patrol their respective jurisdictions in groups, day and night, to prevent crime. At 11:30 a.m. the day before yesterday, the Huasheng Electric Appliance Store at No. 484, Yixin Lane, Xiangfen Lane, Nanjing Road, was suddenly invaded by five robbers. After searching and looting for a long time, they obtained $450 yuan and fled in different directions. Among the robbers, Wen Bingrong, a native of Wuxi, and Li Wenming, a native of Hebei, were seen by Huang Fusen, a Chinese detective from the General Patrol Department, while patrolling the street. Suspecting their behavior, he followed them. Seeing them enter the Da Zhonghua Hotel on Xizang Road, he was about to apprehend them when the two men came out again. Huang continued to follow them to the Jiangsu Automobile Company on Guizhou Road. The two robbers were about to call a car to Hongkou. Seeing that the situation was urgent, Huang immediately called Zhao Ziren, a Chinese detective chief, and Bao Yutang, a policeman, from the Lao Zha Police Station to assist in arresting Wen and Li. They were taken back to the police station. After questioning, Yao Gengsheng, a native of Shanghai, was arrested in Room 526 of the Da Zhonghua Hotel, and Li Yunxuan, a native of Wuxi, Weng Linsheng, a native of Shanghai, Zeng Xiangsheng, a native of Shanghai, Ping Genlin, a native of Suzhou, Shen Hesheng, a native of Huzhou, and Li A'da, a native of Chongming, were successively arrested in Room 3, Anle Hotel, Baoyu Lane, Edward Road. A pistol, 194 bullets, and stolen money of $136.5 yuan were seized and taken to the police station. In total, the case was solved in just one hour from the time it occurred to the time of arrest, which is extremely fast. Yesterday morning, the case was transferred to the First Special Court's Criminal Division One. The police lawyer, Ru Baoyi, prosecuted Wen Bingrong, Li Wenming, Yao Gengsheng, and Li Yunxuan under Article 348 of the Criminal Law. The other defendants were detained for further investigation. Zeng Xiangsheng hired Fan Gang as his lawyer. Presiding Judge Qian Hongye briefly questioned the defendants and ordered them to be remanded in custody for further questioning at a later date.</p>

<p>Cao Jiaorong Accuses Master of Rape Resulting in Pregnancy</p>
<p>Judge Suggests Best to Settle Out of Court</p>
<p>Tao Dahai, a professional foreign goods broker, rented a house with his concubine Tao Wangshi (named Wang Laosan) at No. 1, Liangshan Lane, Pingji Road, last autumn. They schemed to drug Cao Jiaorong, a 21-year-old maid from Ningbo, with wine, and then raped her. Unexpectedly, this one encounter resulted in a secret pregnancy. As the maid was a widow, it was difficult for her to face her in-laws with a pregnancy. Therefore, she hired lawyer Wu Peng to file a rape lawsuit in the First Special District District Court against Tao Dahai, Wang Laosan, and the introducer Lu A'xiang (also known as He Xiang). The lawsuit also included a civil suit, requesting the court to order the defendants to pay alimony of $25 yuan per month. The lawsuit stated that the plaintiff, due to the death of her husband, had only one remaining aunt-in-law and two young children to support. Forced by livelihood, she left her aunt-in-law and children to seek a living in Shanghai. On July 24, she was introduced by her fellow villager Lu A'xiang to work as a maid at Tao's house for a monthly salary of $6 yuan. Later, because the Tao family had another girl who also needed care, the salary was increased by $4 yuan. On the second day of her service, Tao and Wang paid her $20 yuan in advance, saying that they were issuing it in advance because of her poor family circumstances. The plaintiff was grateful for the consideration of the male and female masters and did not know that they had other intentions. Unexpectedly, on the evening of August 1, Tao and Wang colluded to set up a situation, preparing wine and dishes, and treating her with good intentions, even drugging the plaintiff and making her unable to resist. They committed rape. After sobering up, she was filled with sorrow and despair. Tao consoled her in bed, and Wang Laosan also used inducements and threats, saying that because she had no children, if she conceived, she would be heavily rewarded and made the main wife. She was subsequently raped several times. Unexpectedly, after Tao's lust was satisfied, he became tired of her. Although she was already pregnant, he broke his promise and, together with Wang Laosan, began to abuse her. Wang had an opium addiction and needed $5 yuan a day to satisfy it. She repeatedly used a opium needle to stab the plaintiff all over her body. On October 28, she was forced to leave and could not return to her hometown. The defendants' actions were obviously illegal. Therefore, she filed a lawsuit in accordance with Articles 240 and 244 of the Criminal Law and Article 337, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Procedure Law, requesting that they be punished as they deserve and also filing a civil lawsuit to deter illegal acts and protect women's rights. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Qian Wenji opened the trial. Only Wang Laosan was absent due to illness. Tao and Lu both surrendered to the court with lawyers Fan Gang for questioning. According to Cao Jiaorong, after she became pregnant after being raped, Tao Dahai was extremely happy. In addition to making silk clothes for her, he ordered his concubine Wang Laosan to accompany her to Dr. Chen Xiaobao's clinic at Yimiao for diagnosis and to take miscarriage prevention medication. However, Tao Dahai completely denied the allegations. Lu A'xiang only admitted to introducing the plaintiff to work at Tao's house and did not know about the other matters. Later, Xia, a neighbor of Tao, testified that another maid who had been dismissed by Tao's family said that Cao Jiaorong was a servant during the day and a wife at night. This was hearsay, and whether it was true was not known. Judge Qian believed that it was best to settle this type of case privately, so he ordered the case to be rescheduled and instructed both parties to mediate outside the court.</p>

<p>The opium addiction treatment center established by the Xinwei Relief Society was decided by the eighth board meeting to be closed at the end of 1932. However, at that time, there were still opium addicts in the center who had not been able to break their addiction, so an extension of one month was approved. The patients who are currently in the hospital have all been discharged one after another. Various documents and utensils of the center have also been numbered and registered.

<p>Ancient Bell of Mingxin Temple is One of the Few Antiquities</p>
<p>Invigorate National Spirit and Reform Laziness</p>
<p>The Shanghai County Bureau of Education suggested to the County Government yesterday that the ancient bell of Mingxin Temple in Beiqiao be designated as a work and rest bell. The document stated that the chief of the Zhuanqiao Farmer Education Center, Zhang Yi, reported that the ancient bell of Mingxin Temple in Beiqiao is one of the few antiquities in our county. The county chief and people from all walks of life initiated and sponsored the collection of funds to repair the bell. The preservation of antiquities will rival Tang sculptures. At a time when foreign disasters are imminent and customs are lazy and extravagant, awakening the vigilance of the people and invigorating the national spirit is an urgent task for today. This year's center has a plan to set up an alarm bell. Recently, reading a newspaper report that the Department of Education ordered each county to set up a work and rest bell to invigorate the national spirit and reform folk laziness, I feel the necessity of setting up the bell even more. The ancient bell of Mingxin Temple in Beiqiao is large in shape and loud in sound, making it most suitable for use as a work and rest bell. In addition to preparing funds to equip the center with its own work and rest bell to supplement the inadequacy of the ancient bell of Mingxin Temple, I respectfully submit this document to the director of the bureau, suggesting that the County Government designate the ancient bell of Mingxin Temple in Beiqiao as a work and rest bell to warn and save the nation. This is in the public interest.</p>

<p>The end of the year is the accounting period for the business community. The near-sea ships in Shanghai also agreed to take a break for a few days within these few days. The ship bureaus had already agreed that the Shanghai-Taiwan, Tongyang, and other ships would first suspend their voyages starting on the 23rd. The suspension dates have been verified and recorded by this newspaper. Unexpectedly, the shipping companies on the Shanghai-Ningbo route suddenly received a telegram from the Ministry of Communications, stating that the lunar new year has long been clearly prohibited by the central government. Shipping is related to transportation and should not be suspended. The China Merchants, Sanbei, Ningshao, and other companies were ordered to continue to operate as usual and not to suspend operations. Yesterday, China Merchants, Ningshao, Sanbei, and others had to cancel the planned suspension dates. The Ningbo-bound ships continued to operate as usual, and a notice has been issued to inform passengers. However, the New Beijing ship of Taikoo, because it is a foreign merchant, is not subject to the orders of the Ministry of Communications, so it will suspend operations twice according to the agreed dates.</p>

<p>Hand-in-hand at Cafes, Restaurants, Movie Theaters</p>
<p>Enticed and Forced into Losing Her Virginity at the Cangzhou Hotel</p>
<p>| Unexpectedly Turning Hostile and Taking Each Other to Court |</p>
<p>Sheng Yuchang, the eldest grandson of the late Qing Dynasty Grand Guardian Sheng Xingxun, is being sued for adultery and abandonment by Yan Minghan, a local resident, his wife Yan Qu, and their daughter Yan Shuangqin, who are represented by lawyers Dong Yu and Zhang Zhirang, at the Second Special District Court. The essence of the lawsuit states that Yan Shuangqin is the daughter of Yan Minghan and Yan Qu. The Yans have lived in Shanghai at Jin Situ Temple Alley No. 2, Kang'nou Road, with their children and grandchildren all residing together. In 1927, the defendant, Sheng Yuchang, also lived in the same alley. Yan Shuangqin had to pass by the defendant's door on her way to school, thus the defendant saw her. At that time, Shuangqin was under the age of nineteen, and the defendant, seeing that Shuangqin was not bad in appearance,</p>
<p>conceived illicit thoughts. He often instructed his accountant, Ms. Xue Hanyun, to deliberately visit the Yans' residence and get close to Shuangqin, and invited her to play at the places she worked. The Minghan couple were old, frail, and often ill, and burdened with family affairs, so they did not notice Ms. Xue's ill intentions. In the autumn of that year, Shuangqin accompanied her mother to Wing On Company for shopping, and they met the defendant on the way. They also went to Wing On Company, and the defendant bought a delicate watch and a bottle of perfume, along with the invoice, and placed them in front of Shuangqin before leaving. Afterwards, the defendant took advantage of Shuangqin's acquaintance with Ms. Hanyun to entice Shuangqin to go to cafes for snacks. A few days later, he lured her to watch a movie. One day, he invited Shuangqin to take a drive in his car, and at mealtime, they</p>
<p>went to the Cangzhou Hotel. Shuangqin, young and ignorant, thought the hotel was just a place to eat, but unexpectedly, she was led into a room and subjected to all sorts of enticements and deceits. Shuangqin sternly refused and tried to escape, but the door was locked, and the defendant claimed that he was currently in a divorce lawsuit with his wife, and as soon as the lawsuit was over, he would marry Shuangqin. Shuangqin, through his deception and coercion, was forced to lose her virginity. To this day, she thinks of it with deep hatred. Afterwards, he occasionally invited her out, sometimes to eat, sometimes to watch movies, or to go to hotels. This went on for over a year. In the winter of 1928, the defendant was accused of a criminal offense and fled. In May 1930, he saw Shuangqin again and employed the same old tricks,</p>
<p>renting the house at No. 32, LaFayette Road, LaFayette Lane, for Shuangqin to live in. He himself would come occasionally in his free time. Later, the defendant began to go out and return with his wife's niece, their relationship unclear, and people gossiped. He became increasingly cold towards Shuangqin. In July of this year, the defendant's rented house at No. 130, Guofu Road, was due to expire, and Shuangqin moved in. The defendant went from being cold to completely abandoning her. When Shuangqin personally went to his house to inquire, he initially evaded her, but later ignored her. When she sent letters to question him, he also did not reply. Shuangqin hired a lawyer to send a letter of inquiry, and the defendant commissioned his friend Niu Menmian to entrust Ms. Yu Suqi to mediate with Shuangqin, willing to give 3,000 yuan to terminate the relationship. Shuangqin replied that being seduced and losing her virginity could not be settled with money alone. She only thinks that</p>
<p>Shuangqin, a girl from a good family, had always received a good upbringing. Unfortunately, her family was neighbors with the defendant, and she was deceived by him, seduced and abandoned. The facts are clear, and Shuangqin hates him to the core and has no way to seek justice. The defendant has committed the crime of seduction under Article 257, Paragraph 1, and the crime of abandonment under Article 310, Paragraph 1, of the Criminal Law, and requests that he be punished according to the law. Subsequently, the court summoned the defendant, and the defendant hired lawyer Qiu Fenling to present a defense, stating that the elements of seduction or abduction under Article 257 of the Criminal Law require that the seduction be of a man or woman under the age of twenty, separating them from their parent or guardian who has parental rights. According to the plaintiff Yan Shuangqin, she is now twenty-five years old. According to the plaintiff's statement, she only began to</p>
<p>cohabit in LaFayette Lane in 1930. Shuangqin was already twenty years old at that time, and the provisions of the aforementioned article cannot be applied. There is already Interpretation Example No. 224 of the Seventeenth Year to interpret this. As for this case, it was Shuangqin who seduced the defendant, not the defendant who abducted Shuangqin. At that time, Shuangqin and the defendant lived in the same neighborhood. One was a girl from a small family, naturally romantic, and the other was the son of a prominent family, a scholar by nature. Shuangqin admired the defendant for being handsome and wealthy. Initially, her eyes followed him, moving her spirit, and she began to seduce him. Later, she wrote letters in her own hand, asking to meet him in a certain place. The sentiments were tangled and impossible to finish reading.</p>
<p>The defendant was at the prime of his youth and was eventually overturned. The letters are still there; how can she deny it? (There are as many as eleven letters.) Moreover, the house on LaFayette Road was rented by Shuangqin through her brother-in-law, Zheng Shifan (who has already been sentenced to life imprisonment for kidnapping Pu Wenting and others). Therefore, the defendant did not initially know the details of the house address, as evidenced by Shuangqin's letters. The so-called separation from those who have parental rights is even more untenable. Now that Shuangqin has never acquired the status of a family member of the defendant,</p>
<p>the defendant has no obligation to support her. However, the defendant is benevolent and has given her money from time to time. How can there be any abandonment to speak of? Moreover, Shuangqin is only twenty-five years old, neither old nor young, and has no disabilities. The responsibility of abandonment under criminal law is even more difficult to establish. In short, the plaintiffs are fabricating accusations and have ulterior motives. This case was heard yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM by Judge Wang Gangxu in the Criminal Court No. 1. He first questioned the plaintiffs and then the defendant, who stated that he was 36 years old and that he met the plaintiff in 1930, not six years ago. The rented house was rented by Shuangqin herself through her brother-in-law. In July of this year, Shuangqin moved into Guofu Road without the defendant's consent. However, the defendant's feelings for Shuangqin</p>
<p>were not lost. It was because her relatives were involved in a kidnapping case, and the defendant advised her to break away from them, but she refused, hence the estrangement. However, the defendant still gave her over a thousand yuan for expenses in February and did not neglect to support her. The plaintiff's lawyer claimed that the defendant had been committing adultery with Shuangqin for six years. There is now written evidence from the defendant himself, and his friends Niu Men and Ms. Yu Suqi can testify. The witness Ms. Yu Suqi then testified in court, proving that the defendant had entrusted Niu Men to explain to her that the two had known each other for six years. Yan Shuangqin claimed that the house in LaFayette Lane was rented by her with 1,000 yuan given to her by the defendant. The questioning continued until 6:30 PM. Judge Wang ordered the defendant to provide bail and be available at any time and directed both parties to try to reconcile privately, adjourning the hearing to another day.</p>

<p>Public Security Bureau:</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau, under Director Wen, recently stated that defense is important during the winter defense period, and there will inevitably be more violations of police regulations during the Lunar New Year. Yesterday, he specifically instructed all section and department staff to arrive at the bureau on time every day. Even on Lunar New Year's Day, they must be at their desks to handle official business to avoid delaying important matters. He also ordered the section and team leaders in each district to increase patrols day and night during Lunar New Year's Eve and New Year's Day to strengthen defenses.</p>
<p>Police Station:</p>
<p>Today is Lunar New Year's Eve. Although the business community has implemented the Gregorian calendar, many still use the old lunar calendar. It is customary to close accounts and collect debts everywhere. The Shanghai Municipal Police, deeply concerned that thieves and bandits will take the opportunity to be active, has strictly ordered all police stations under its jurisdiction that all Chinese and Western police officers on duty are not allowed to leave the police station and must be on standby. All Chinese and Western detectives will be fully armed and patrolling everywhere, and a car patrol team will be formed to drive motorcycles and inspect the roads. The Gordon Road reserve team will also be fully deployed. In addition to the original posts, double posts will be added to each road, and plainclothes detectives will be stationed in each secluded place. Armored vehicles equipped with machine guns will continuously patrol key areas to prevent petty criminals from being active.</p>

<p>| Is It Right To Eat Zhao Yanru Et Al's Flesh? |</p>
<p>Zhao Yanru, a native of Anhui who previously worked in a certain army, was dismissed from his post for some reason. Idling and addicted to sensuality, he found it difficult to make a living. Recently, under the pretext of providing relief to the Northeast Volunteer Army, he had cards and receipts printed, falsely claiming to be a staff member of the relief team of that organization. He colluded with his friend Gao Xianchang, also from Anhui, to solicit donations from shops and residents in the Chinese area. He spent the funds and stayed in a room at the Dale Hotel at No. 6, Hongyuan Lane, Huade Road. At 7:20 AM the day before yesterday, Chinese constable Hao Yigu, detective Wu Shoushan, and Western constable Mai Kai of the Yulin Road police station went to the hotel to check for hidden bandits. They found Zhao's room, No. 35, and saw him in a flustered state. A small leather suitcase was placed on the bed. They asked him to open it. Zhao initially refused, but knowing that it was unavoidable, he opened it with trembling hands. Inside, they found five receipt books and a box of cards. When Constable Hao questioned him, Zhao suddenly became assertive and claimed that he was a staff member of a formal organization and that they should not interfere too much. The Chinese and Western detectives arrested him and took him, along with his friend Gao Xianchang and the suitcase, to the stairway of the hotel. Zhao, in desperation, knelt down and begged Constable Hao to release him, saying that he had been helping but failed. They were all detained in the police station. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin stated the previous situation and claimed that the first defendant, Zhao Yanru, claimed at the police station that he had an accomplice named Chen Zhonghe, who was indeed a staff member of the relief team and with whom he had contact. He had been fraudulently soliciting donations, totaling 130 yuan, from December last year to January this year. The money was all spent on a prostitute named Chen Juan in the French Concession. A photo of the prostitute has been copied. The victims included the Dafeng Coal Store at No. 595, Peng Road (2 yuan, with a receipt). The remaining cases will be investigated in detail. The police station has filed a public prosecution based on Article 364, Paragraph 1, of the Criminal Law for fraud and obtaining property. The second defendant, Gao Xianchang, is a well-known rogue on Huade Road and helped to defraud the money. If the two defendants were not caught, they would have gone to Suzhou to do the same thing. All the confiscated evidence will be submitted for inspection. Then, Chinese constable Hao Yigu and Chinese and Western detectives Jin Ming recounted the circumstances of arresting the two defendants. The owner of the Dafeng Coal Store on Peng Road, Wang Yongqing, testified that the defendant Zhao Yanru came to solicit a donation of 2 yuan on the 19th of this month and gave a receipt. When questioned, the two defendants stammered. After Judge Zhao Linyu verified the statements, he ordered them to be remanded in custody and rescheduled the hearing for further investigation.</p>

Zhongkan tossed and turned in bed, and upon hearing the news, he felt immense pain and resentment, which led to his illness and death on November 25 of last year. Now, his father, Mr. Zhu, has entrusted the Gongming Law Firm to sue Wu Xunqing and his daughter Wu Huilian for abandonment in the Special District Court.</p>

The stationmaster sent police to take care of the matter and notified the local bailiff to report the incident. They also looked for the deceased's family to identify the body and arrange for a coffin. Later, because the deceased was poor, they requested the railway bureau to provide compensation for the coffin, amounting to 20 yuan, to prepare a coffin for burial.</p>

<p>Reader's Advisory</p>
<h3 id="e152">Further Discussion on "Production Rationalization" <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>｜Letter from Mr. Shen Yimin｜</p>
<p>Mr. Zhu Ying's reply to my previous letter discussing production rationalization (see this column, January 23rd) is fundamentally not</p>
<p>different. What Mr. Zhu is talking about is naturally the production rationalization of the current society, i.e., capitalist society. Its "result" will naturally "make you exhausted all day and unable to get enough to eat." The statement "This sentence can be established" is not a problem, and I did not object to it. The reason why I thought Mr. Zhu should explain it further is that some people, especially some laborers, often deeply resent and abhor the value of production rationalization itself because they suffer from the pain of capitalist production rationalization, and they do not have time to think about what significance this kind of experience of production rationalization has for the future socialist economic organization. Therefore, extending from Mr. Zhu's article is not entirely dissatisfaction with Mr. Zhu's words. Furthermore, in my opinion, what Mr. Zhu said today still has room for discussion: (1) Mr. Zhu said: "Mr. Shen's saying is based on 'the planned economy of the Soviet Union, which reveals this clue,' in other words, the economic organization of the Soviet Union also implements 'production rationalization.'" In fact, Mr. Zhu has misunderstood a bit. I only said that "the planned economy of the Soviet Union reveals this clue," and did not say that the Soviet Union has already implemented "production rationalization." (2) Mr. Zhu said: "Whether or not the Soviet Union seems to have reached this term, even if it is called 'production rationalization' in the future, the freedom and equality of capitalism and the freedom and equality of socialism are completely different.)" Yes, they are completely different. But this "completely different" is not in the institution of production rationalization, but in its social relations, in other words, in the purpose of socialist production rationalization, the subject of its application, and the scope of its application. I said very clearly in my previous letter: "...In this kind of society (i.e., socialist society, Yimin), production is no longer for the sake of commodities, but for the consumption of the producers themselves," and the editor of the Shanghai News reader's consultant said even more clearly in his reply: "...Production rationalization is the highest expression of the production method in a commodity-producing society, but when this highest production method reaches a certain level, it becomes incompatible with the production relations from which it came. As a result, it digs the grave for the social organization formed by this production relationship, and 'you all enter the bag, and then break out of his mother's womb and become the 'blessed child' of a higher stage of social organization.'" Therefore, I dare to say that the content of the Soviet Union's "Five-Year Plan" is the (higher expression) of the experience and technology of production rationalization in capitalist society, although it does not mark the term production rationalization, and although it has not fully expressed its content. As for the (term), it is a secondary issue. A newly established country on the road to socialism must use and learn the valuable experiences and technologies of bourgeois countries everywhere and inherit its great heritage in its entirety. For example, the democratic education and teaching methods of Dewey and Hall in the United States have one meaning in the capitalist society of the United States, but once they are adopted by the Soviet Union, they become completely another meaning. No one has ever denied that the Soviet Union has adopted American education methods because the Soviet Union has not marked democratic education. A researcher of materialist dialectics should pursue concrete problems, not just pursue the existence or absence of (terms). Because of Mr. Zhu's letter, I rashly expressed my opinions again. I hope Mr. Zhu and the readers will forgive my madness and foolishness and teach me. (Night of January 23rd)</p>

<h3 id="e158">Cai Yuanpei Praises University and Middle School Entrance Examination Guidance <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>Students Taking Entrance Exams Should Not Miss This</p>
<p>Mr. Lu Shaoji, the director of the Normal Department of Jiangsu Provincial Shanghai Middle School, has a considerable research in education. He has a very rich experience in guiding students to higher education. His recent books "University Entrance Examination Guidance" and "Middle School Entrance Examination Guidance" are noteworthy. "University Entrance Examination Guidance" explains the purpose, methods, procedures, and economic prospects of going to university and vocational schools, providing detailed guidance. It also collects the names, addresses, and content of universities and vocational schools across the country for selection. "Middle School Entrance Examination Guidance" guides elementary school students to enter middle school and middle school students to transfer schools. It provides detailed explanations of middle school education regulations, the content and nature of middle schools in various places, middle school expenses, examination rules and methods, and future prospects. The above two books were introduced by Mr. Cai Yuanpei to students across the country who are taking entrance exams to universities and middle schools, praising them as "indeed guidance for those who aspire to higher education." Therefore, we specially publish them for those taking entrance exams.</p>
<h3 id="e159">Preliminary Proposal for Reorganizing the National Normal School System (Part II) Luo Tingguang <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>3. Both normal schools and rural normal schools should be established independently. The length of study should be three years for normal schools and two or three years for rural normal schools (depending on local conditions). Both should enroll junior high school graduates. When necessary, rural normal schools may enroll senior elementary school graduates and provide them with a period of training.</p>
<p>4. In order to meet the needs of temporary teachers, normal schools may establish special normal departments and kindergarten normal departments, with a length of study ranging from one to two years.</p>
<p>5. Normal schools, rural normal schools, special normal departments, kindergarten normal departments, etc., should not charge tuition fees, and the government should provide food and lodging as a principle. Regarding the item of loan fees for normal school students, there are still many who disagree. They may say that normal schools are not charitable organizations after all, and the treatment of normal school students should not be different from that of ordinary middle school students, or that once normal schools are free, general poor students will flock to them, resulting in the loss of the original meaning of normal education, or that this will inevitably lead to the dependence of normal school students, etc. However, it is not known that normal education has a special purpose, so strict recruitment of new students to provide special training is also its fixed principle. The fact that normal schools do not charge tuition fees and that the government provides food and lodging as appropriate is one to show preferential treatment to normal school students, encourage them to study diligently, and strengthen their lifelong commitment to education, and the other is to strictly set standards to select suitable talents for training. This has achieved remarkable results in old normal schools. The state establishes political schools to train political workers, Party affairs schools to train Party affairs talents, and normal schools to train normal school talents. Political schools and Party affairs schools all achieve great results with free education. Why should there be doubts about free education for normal school students?</p>
<p>6. Normal universities and normal colleges of universities (i.e., current education colleges) are the orthodox institutions for cultivating secondary school teachers. In general, normal universities and normal colleges of universities have two missions: one is to cultivate secondary school teachers, and the other is to study education science. Otherwise, they are not worthy of the name of normal (university) and university (normal) (or (education)) college (Note 4). However, speaking separately, the two also have their differences. Normal universities are independently established institutions that can absolutely divide and train various teachers according to needs. Normal colleges of universities, because they are adjacent to other colleges, must earnestly connect with other colleges and cooperate to achieve the effect of division of labor. The detailed plan will be explained separately.</p>
<p>7. The establishment of normal schools should adopt a zoning system. Each province should be divided into several normal education zones according to actual conditions (Jiangsu is divided into six zones). Each zone should have at least one normal school. The whole country can also be divided into several higher normal education zones, each with at least one normal university or normal college of university. Normal schools or normal universities or normal colleges of universities, in addition to cultivating teachers, are also responsible for guiding and improving general education in their respective zones.</p>
<p>8. In order to meet the current urgent needs, normal universities and normal colleges of universities may establish advanced normal specialty departments, with a length of study of two or three years, to be determined according to actual conditions.</p>
<p>9. Normal universities, normal colleges of universities, and normal specialty departments do not charge tuition fees, and the government provides food and lodging as appropriate.</p>
<p>10. The service regulations for normal school students must be strictly stipulated. Those who do not comply will be disqualified and their expenses will be recovered. The reason why the service regulations for normal school students in the past were equivalent to mere formality was actually because the government authorities did not strictly implement them. In the future, efforts should be made to reform them, and they can be implemented in accordance with Article 6 of the Third Plenary Session Resolution (see above).</p>
<p>11. The future of normal school students should have a definite guarantee. Training should be carried out according to actual needs to ensure adequate supply so that normal school graduates have jobs to serve, or serve them to the best of their ability, or change their careers midway and leave. Various methods can be used (such as certifying teachers, improving teacher treatment, and guaranteeing education funding, etc.) to give them definite guarantees.</p>
<p>12. All levels of normal education institutions should have affiliated schools or experimental schools for normal school students to practice and research (Note 5).</p>
<p>13. The management and training of normal schools, normal universities, or normal colleges of universities should uniformly adopt strict principles, with the aim of cultivating teachers who are hardworking and able to endure hardship, love the country and love the group, and correcting the past accumulated malpractices of depression or selfishness.</p>
<p>14. Basic education and professional training should be equally emphasized in teaching. In addition to the educational knowledge they receive, normal school students should be roughly familiar with the content of the subjects they want to teach and be proficient in their teaching methods (Note 6).</p>
<p>15. Those who are not from a normal school background but want to be elementary and secondary school teachers must be certified and registered by the government. The regulations for certification and registration will be formulated separately.</p>
<p>(Note 1) In "The Advantages and Disadvantages of Merging Normal Schools and My Personal Opinions on This Issue" (China Education Circle, Volume 17, Issue 2), Luo Tingguang has investigated the reasons of all parties one by one, and ultimately does not approve of this system.</p>

<h3 id="e161">Sino-American Military Basketball Game Military Academy vs. McLeans Tonight at 8 PM at West YMCA <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>Tomorrow Night Military Academy Will Play Pirates Again</p>
<p>The Central Military Academy basketball team will play its fourth game in Shanghai tonight against McLeans at the West YMCA, starting at 8 PM. McLeans lost twice to the Military Academy on their previous trip to Beijing. Judging from the Military Academy's recent three performances, the Military Academy should win without a doubt. However, McLeans is good at attacking, so they should not be taken lightly. The Pirates again. The West YMCA Pirates have agreed to the Military Academy's request and will play their second game on the evening of the Lunar New Year on the 26th at 8 PM, but the venue is still the West YMCA basketball court. Judging from the results of the first game between the two teams, the Military Academy only lost by four points. Success or failure depends on luck. It is not that the Military Academy cannot beat the Pirates. In order to prevent crowding, the West YMCA will reserve seats on the balcony for that evening, priced at two yuan per seat. Reservations can be made at the large counter on the West YMCA balcony. One corner of the balcony will be reserved for members' seats, and the other two sides will be sold for one yuan each, without reservation. The referees will still be Zhang Guoxun and Shu Hong.</p>
<p>Military Academy Banquet Last night, the Military Academy basketball team hosted a banquet at the Weiya Restaurant to entertain reporters and friends. During the banquet, team leader Du Tingxi gave a speech, stating that he had gained a lot of experience from this trip to Shanghai, and was satisfied to learn about the methods and performances of Shanghai's strong teams, and hoped for further guidance. He then stated the purpose of the Military Academy's promotion of sports, which is to cultivate talents who will promote sports as entertainment in the future army, and to pay more attention to sportsmanship, never to boast about victory or defeat, or to use the team for promotion. He also reported on the Military Academy's sports facilities, saying that the construction of the basketball court and swimming pool will begin soon, costing more than 200,000 yuan, and he hopes that they will be completed in October, and he plans to invite Shanghai teams to compete in the future.</p>

<h3 id="e162">Youth Turns Defeat into Victory; Jianhua and Huadong Victorious <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>Youth 37... Jianhua 33</p>
<p>Huadong 43... Xiaguang 41</p>
<p>｜Eagle Team Expected to Have a Dramatic Battle Tonight｜</p>
<p>Last night at the Shanghai Basketball Association, the four group matches saw interest concentrated on the Youth vs. Jianhua game. Jianhua led for most of the way, seemingly smoothly, but unexpectedly, Youth was able to come from behind and turn defeat into victory. The Huadong vs. Xiaguang game lacked fixed formations and spirit, attracting few spectators and thus proving less exciting. There are still four games tonight, with the Group A match being Eagle Team vs. Zhenru. Eagle Team has renowned players like Lin Zequn and Kong Guangyi, so their strength is considerable. Their previous match against Huadong already showcased their talent. Zhenru is Jì'nan University, and their basketball skills have long been appreciated, so their meeting tonight should provide a good performance. The schedule for tonight is as follows:</p>
<p>Yu Guang vs. Yi Team, Group B3, 4:40 PM, Chen Fuzhang</p>
<p>Mei Gong vs. Liangxi, Group B1, 5:30 PM, Zhang Peter</p>
<p>Junior vs. Law School, Group B1, 6:30 PM, Zhang Wugao</p>
<p>Eagle Team vs. Zhenru, Group A2, 7:30 PM, Qu Hongren (Note) Today's Quanguang vs. Huafeng match has been postponed. The Eagle Team vs. Zhenru match has been changed to 7:30 PM. The Jiangju vs. Mailing match on the 26th has been postponed. The Qingguang vs. Nanxing match on the 27th has been changed to February 1st at 8:30 PM.</p>
<p>Youth Turns Defeat into Victory In the second Group A1 match last night, Youth vs. Jianhua, the teams were evenly matched. Jianhua led most of the way, with Youth trailing behind. The Youth team is a combination of the Yohannan University and Middle School teams, and their movements were clean and crisp. In the first half, Jianhua won 17-13. In the second half, Youth still lagged behind. Despite intense attacks, there was no improvement. Furthermore, the pillar of their defense, Wu Youliang, was ejected for committing four fouls and replaced by Zhang Peixin. The situation suddenly improved. At that time, Jianhua still led by a score of 27-23. Youth surrounded and attacked, repeatedly probing the basket. Zhang Peixin and Tao Zunan repeatedly scored points. Cheng Jingxing and Zhou Xuexian made excellent corner shots, leveling and exceeding the score. Their momentum was immense. At this time, Jianhua's morale was greatly reduced. Focusing on strict defense, they turned victory into defeat, falling behind 29-35. Despite further efforts, they only added two points, and Youth ultimately turned defeat into victory by a margin of four points, with a final score of 37-33.</p>
<p>Huadong Wins with Difficulty The main event was the Group A match between Huadong and Xiaguang. Both sides had lost their inherent edge, with scattered formations and disordered advances and retreats, making the situation lax and greatly reducing interest. Huadong initially won 12-2. Xiaguang caught up, scoring five consecutive points to tie the score at 12-12. The situation became slightly tense, but the brilliance was still lacking. Huadong then regained momentum. Chen Xianglong and Xia Zeren scored 11 consecutive points. Yang Linyu also made a shot. At the end of the first half, Huadong led 26-15. The situation suddenly became tense in the second half, and the competition was fierce. Qian Dingshen of Huadong was unlucky, missing every shot. Xiaguang gradually caught up, exceeding Huadong twice with a score of 41-39. With little time remaining, Yang Linyu made a brilliant shot to tie the score at 41-41. In the ensuing scramble, with only four seconds left, it seemed like the game would end in a tie and go into overtime. However, Huadong had good fortune, and Chen Xianglong made a final shot to secure the victory, with a final score of 43-41.</p>

<p>The Shanghai-Hong Kong football tournament will be held in Hong Kong tomorrow afternoon, set to cause a sensation in Hong Kong. Before February, when the Hong Kong team came to Shanghai, the result of the tournament was a 3-4 defeat for Shanghai. This time in Hong Kong, Shanghai has little hope of victory.</p>
<p>Little Hope for Shanghai The Hong Kong team's defensive line is the same as last time, but the forwards have added Da and Xiao Gaosannu, doubling their strength compared to last time. The Shanghai team's forwards are too weak, and there is no center forward. Parker could not go due to other commitments, and Li Yichen was selected as a replacement, but Li declined. The captain, Zhá Xǔ, will make a temporary decision, choosing one of the substitutes, Jack or Basilie. The carelessness of the arrangements is such. The two sides' lineups are listed below:</p>

The Hong Kong side is already in the process of organizing a team and stepping up training. The holding of this event is sure to encourage the development of basketball skills nationwide. At the same time, it is hoped that the National Sports Association can invite the top basketball teams from Tianjin and Beiping to Shanghai to participate, so as to promote mutual improvement and increase interest. It is also hoped that it can be held annually in the future, so as to improve national basketball skills and avenge the shame of the defeat in the Far East Games, achieving tangible benefits.</p>

<h3 id="e171">From Iron Birds to Sparrows <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>— Zhan Lu</p>
<p>Everyone knows that bomber planes, like soaring eagles, are the most terrifying things in the world. In the past year or two, the lives and properties of compatriots sacrificed under the enemy's iron birds, if totaled up, would be an astonishing record, a wound etched forever.</p>
<p>Iron birds are indeed terrifying, but the terror of sparrows is no less than that of iron birds! As the ancients said: "Three birds harm people: crows, bustards, and sparrows." In fact, the harm of opium and that of old bustards is not widespread. Among the three harms, only sparrows cause the greatest harm! In terms of the extent of their harm, they not only exceed crows and bustards, but also exceed bombers, which are called iron birds! This is because iron birds cause harm under special circumstances, while sparrows cause harm under widespread circumstances. The lives and properties sacrificed under iron birds are accidental, while the lives and properties sacrificed under sparrows are constant. Look! In ordinary families, it is difficult to find a copy of a national map; however, mahjong tiles are a common sight! Listen! In ordinary society, it is difficult to hear a few words that awaken the foolish and stubborn; in ordinary society, a few vivid and colorful mahjong gambling guides can be heard everywhere, whether on the streets, in alleys, in tea houses, or in taverns!</p>
<p>Some people say: Mahjong tiles have been exported and are popular in the New World. This shows that foreigners also like to play this game, so why blame only the people of this country? In fact, this is not the case. Americans play mahjong not as a form of gambling, but as a kind of group game. At banquets, mahjong games are organized according to the number of guests. After one game, the winners of each game are invited to form one or more games to compete in a rematch to determine the winner. Those who are eliminated for the first time can only watch from the sidelines and are not allowed to compete again. In this way, the winners continue to compete in the finals, and in the end, there must be one person who wins the championship. Focusing on the game and not betting on material things, how noble is that!</p>
<p>People only know that "oranges turn into trifoliate oranges when they cross the Huai River," but they do not know that "trifoliate oranges also turn into oranges when they cross the Huai River." Mahjong is not a noble game, but when it flies to America, it becomes noble. Isn't this the trifoliate orange turning into an orange when it crosses the Huai River?</p>
<h3 id="e172">Opium Comedy <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>— Luo Cunren</p>
<p>｜What happened after public sales｜</p>
<p>If opium were a religion, and we compared the followers of other religions with the followers of this opium religion, I think the great religions of the world would have to come to our Chinese opium religion. Look at how many missionaries and believers there are! Take my hometown as an example. There are only forty or fifty households, but there are four or five opium dens. I saw the following with my own eyes:</p>
<p>A husband, as if losing his soul, shouted to his wife: "Where did you hide the opium I just bought? Bring it here quickly!" The wife pleaded: "Leave it for me to enjoy! I haven't had any for days."</p>
<p>At this time, their anemic four-year-old boy was so hungry that he could not move. He gestured for his mother to fetch mud and cook rice in the pot.</p>
<p>The poor uncle next door heard his nephew and niece-in-law quarreling, came over and scolded them, and confiscated all their opium paraphernalia and opium to show his punishment.</p>
<p>The uncle took his nephew's opium home and smoked it behind closed doors, because he was also an old addict who had no money to buy it. Alas! Opium's China!</p>
<h3 id="e173">Songs and Children <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>— Zhong Yan</p>
<p>｜A Warning to Parents｜</p>
<p>Good songs can imperceptibly improve children's temperament, and bad songs can also imperceptibly worsen children's temperament. Songs have a very important relationship with children, so parents must choose and correct the songs that children can come into contact with.</p>
<p>There are many good songs, but there are also quite a few bad ones. In my county (Fushan, Shandong), there is a very popular song:</p>
<p>Little fat boy, climbs on the windowsill, steals his father's (1) silver dollars; his father beats him, his mother pulls (2) him.</p>
<p>If a child learns to sing this kind of song from a young age, he will get the impression of stealing in his mind. How can he become a good citizen in the future? I am afraid that there are such songs everywhere, so I advise parents not to ignore them.</p>
<p>(1) Father, (2) pleading on his behalf.</p>
<h3 id="e174">The Roll-aways of Society <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>— Tian Fang</p>
<p>Near where I live, there is an old temple inhabited by several ascetic monks. Every early morning, the rhythmic sound of the wooden fish, "ge ge," reaches your pillow, often causing me to imagine their lives with pity. These pitiful selfish people have all been fooled by Indian black charcoal, full of the hope of becoming immortals or Buddhas and ascending to heaven in broad daylight, yet they are still burdened by a stinking skin that needs the support of human material offerings. In the end, when they close their eyes, a mound of yellow earth. Let others name becoming immortals and Buddhas. Isn't the end of life the same as ordinary people? What is the difference between "studying Buddhism" and "waiting to die"? If it is said to be praying to be reborn in the Western Paradise, but if they knew that the "India" they seek is the hometown of the red-headed Indians, that honey bee's needle</p>
<p>During the great battle at the Nine Gates, the campus beauties of Beiping's universities were still ice skating and skiing, enjoying their timely pleasure. Their behavior is probably even worse than the singing girls of the Hou Ting Hua.</p>
<p>When a person's dog goes missing, they want to publish a notice to find it. When a Japanese dog is stolen, they want to hold a memorial service. In the past, in foreign parks, (Chinese and dogs) were treated equally, but now it seems that some people are not as good as dogs.</p>
<p>The French Concession's Gujia Garden is called (Gujia Garden) by the concession authorities, but the people of Shanghai unanimously call it (French Park). This is just like calling the British Concession the Great British Territory, which makes people who come to Shanghai feel jarred! (Sha Yu)</p>
<p>"(Second Master is back)," Hongye's nephew stood at the door.</p>
<p>Hongye didn't have time to answer, and hurried inside. Stepping over the threshold, his father was lying on a rattan couch in the hall. His thin cheeks, a head of long, messy white hair, which had not been trimmed for a long time, looked even more haggard. He wasn't wearing socks, and his feet seemed to be swollen to the point of bursting. His hands and cheeks were also swollen. When he saw Hongye coming in, a smile appeared on his face.</p>
<p>"(Ah! Hongye has come back to see me)!"</p>
<p>"(Dad...)"</p>
<p>His throat locked up, and he couldn't say a second word. His mother and brother led him into the room and told him in a low voice that the doctors in the city were already out of options. Yesterday, someone recommended Doctor X, who was a very famous doctor in Y County, to come to C City for a consultation, which would cost 100 yuan. Without a big favor, he might not even be willing to come. Today, at dawn, the foreman was sent to take a note from Old Zhang next door and take the long-distance bus to ask him to come. He wondered if he would give them the honor.</p>
<p>Hongye also knew that since his father had returned home, almost all of the famous doctors in C Township had been consulted in turn. After taking each doctor's virgin prescription, his sleep was usually more peaceful at night, and the swelling was slightly reduced. However, after taking three or four doses of medicine, he would return to his original state. The famous doctors in C Township were very gentlemanly. If they couldn't cure the disease themselves, they would recommend a worthy person to replace them. A would recommend B, and B would recommend C. The last Confucian doctor, having truly been unable to recommend a doctor who hadn't seen his father's illness before, sighed and frowned, holding Hongye's brother's hand, as if he was about to cut off a piece of his own flesh. "(Your father's illness, his heart's blood has dried up, and I am afraid it cannot be recovered by human power. Tonight, I will respectfully invite the Buddha to descend to the altar and judge the good or bad fortune for you. You yourself can kneel before the altar and ask)."</p>
<p>Hongye's brother, trembling with fear, crawled before the altar and kowtowed three times. The altar's message was the four words "(Life has ended)." That Confucian doctor then left without explanation and never came again.</p>
<p>When eating lunch, his father was still lying on the rattan couch. Suddenly, he pointed to the grilled shrimp on the table; "(The fish and shrimp here cannot be eaten elsewhere, Hongye, you can eat more)." Hongye, who had been under his strict father's knee for twenty years, had never heard this kind of loving tone before. It was like a bright silver needle piercing deep into his heart! Besides saying "(Ah)," he couldn't eat any more. The C Township creed was swirling in his mind:</p>
<p>"(People who are sick should not change their temper)."</p>
<p>Three sedan chair bearers, chanting, actually brought the famous Doctor X from Y County. Hongye followed his brother, dressed in formal attire, to greet him into the study. He turned out to be a short man with a black beard and crossed legs. After looking, asking, feeling the pulse, he picked up a pen and wrote out a pulse diagnosis in one breath on seven or eight sheets of flowered stationery. He was truly like a thousand words written while leaning on a horse, as if he had innate wisdom.</p>
<p>"(Amitabha! This doctor must be your father's savior! Where have you ever heard of a prescription being written on seven or eight sheets of stationery)?" His mother heard Hongye's report, adding one sheet after another. It was only on the eleventh and a half sheet that the taste of joy came. The first ingredient was a pair of clams.</p>
<p>"(I'm afraid this clam cannot be found in the small pharmacies here, you have to go to Richeng to buy it)." (Four)</p>
<p>Zhe Yu Yi</p>
<h3 id="e175">Statements from a Snow-Viewing Spectator <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>— Lin Heng</p>
<p>The wind is as sharp as a blade, the snow as large as goose feathers. The poor rush about with cold stomachs, the rich enjoy the snow around a warm brazier.</p>
<p>The rich sit in Western-style houses with hot water radiators, warm as spring. They look at the snowy scenery through glass windows, so leisurely, so interesting! When they go out, they add a fur coat on top of their fur robes, and sit in sedan-style cars. The northwest wind can't even move a hair on their heads!</p>
<p>I am not rich, so of course I don't have the privilege of living in a Western house or riding in a car. On Avenue Joffre, which seems endless, pedestrians are as rare as morning stars. I stood at the intersection of Rue Pichon, braving the wind and snow, and after waiting for more than a quarter of an hour, a tram finally passed from west to east. I dared not delay, and as soon as the tram stopped, I jumped into the third-class carriage. There were very few people in the carriage, and it was easy to find a seat. As soon as I sat down, I suddenly heard someone shout: "Old Lin! Where are you going?" I looked closely and saw that it was my classmate, Mr. Chen, a movie buff. I replied: "I'm going to a friend's house on Avenue Hua Lung. Where are you going at this hour?" Mr. Chen said: "I'm going to see a movie." I said: "Now the Northeast Volunteer Army is braving the snow to resist Japan, and you are in the mood to brave the snow to see a movie?" Mr. Chen said: "Don't satirize me. Although movies are a form of entertainment, meaningful movies are very beneficial to social education, like '(Two Daughters of the Northeast)' abandoning personal feelings and going to the national crisis; '(A Double Tragedy in a Sea of Sin)' breaking the inheritance system and advocating that the rich use their wealth to organize public welfare. If our Chinese compatriots could all be like the two daughters in '(Two Daughters of the Northeast)' and the rich man in '(A Double Tragedy in a Sea of Sin),' I'm afraid the Northeast Volunteer Army would have already recovered the lost territories." I said: "Alright, alright! I suppose you have a reason for seeing movies. But what about those of us who don't have money to see movies?" At this moment, the tram had arrived at the Hua Long Road station, and I said goodbye to Mr. Chen! and hastily got off the tram.</p>
<h3 id="e176">On Western Opera <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>I myself don't know much about Western opera. But I have generally discussed or know about those famous ancient scripts. However, in Shanghai, even though it is considered the Paris of the East, it is not easy to see Western opera performed on stage on the western shore of the Pacific Ocean. In reality, the Chinese people fundamentally do not need these arts, and they may not even understand them. Even the Westerners traveling in China are mostly fat-bellied compradors of foreign firms, or pastors in churches, who may not truly understand the (essence) of opera. Verdi's "(La) Traviata" ... Moreover, when Western opera is occasionally performed in Shanghai, it is only by Italian troupes traveling the world, who perform for a week or two and then leave. They use the Italian language, singing dialogues and poems. Not to mention that Chinese people can easily understand it, even the English and French who interpret it with English translations cannot obtain the rich emotional tones within the play. ... Even full-fledged Italians rarely have appreciative confidants.</p>
<p>However, for the past few days, the Carlton Theatre has been performing world-famous plays by the "(San) Carlo Opera Company." Not because of the reasons above, the theater is not (empty enough to catch sparrows), but rather business is booming, giving the impression of (an audience filled with appreciative listeners). There, people of all countries and ethnicities are present, as can be seen from their actions and clothing; even many Chinese men and women. | I will not hesitate to admit that I also went with the musician Hu Jingxi to appreciate La Boheme (transliterated as Pohanmi, meaning romantic or wandering artists) by Murger a hundred years ago.</p>
<p>It is only a simple tragic scene about artists' tragic love in a life of poverty. It is divided into four acts: ㈠ Paris in 1830 ㈡ Cafe Momus in Paris ㈢ The gates of Paris ㈣ Same as the first act. In this, just like a Jiangnan person who has never practiced Peking opera listening to Mei Lanfang's fast-paced opera with unfamiliar tones, I do not understand the Italian language. But from their voices, actions, and expressions, I understand it as clearly as if I were watching a shadow play, especially because the accompanying music gives many hints, I can very comfortably experience the script of La Boheme that I have read. (End)</p>
<p>Then he would definitely not want to be born in India to be a descendant of a subjugated people. Putting everything aside, regardless of whether immortals or Buddhas exist, even if they ascend to heaven in broad daylight and attain permanent Nirvana, if they are not absurd stories, then from (birth) to (Nirvana) (ascension), all the processes of going to immortals and Buddhas cannot but require the support of the human world. By the time (merit and practice are complete), they become immortals and Buddhas, but they do not recognize their parents, do not acknowledge their relatives, and even more so do not acknowledge the farmers and workers who clothe and feed me, and the teachers and friends who teach me. This is called (each one cultivates and each one attains), abandoning all affection, isn't that a huge escapee from society? Fortunately, my Buddha is not effective, and not everyone is fooled. To this day, the human race is still diverse and has no worries about food and clothing, and the world has not been occupied by wild beasts. Otherwise, wouldn't the term (humanity) have long been extinct?</p>
<p>Writing this article is to advise those who are stepping on the earth but whose souls are flying beyond the heavens.</p>

<h3 id="e177">The Financial Gold Market is Too Heavily Burdened to Recover <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>A Tragic Fall of Thirteen Taels and Three Mace</p>
<p>The economic conference, war debts, and reparations all cast an unfavorable and depressed atmosphere over the gold market. Bulls find it difficult to break free, and the downward trend is unstoppable. According to yesterday morning's foreign cable, London's long-term bill increased by 0.0625, the British-American exchange rate rose by 1.25 points, the American-British exchange rate rose by 8.125, plus American silver increased by 0.25, and the forward silver price rose by more than 3% to 4.5%. The bank's private cable also increased sharply by 0.375. The opening bid was 784 taels. Da Xing Yong sold more than 200 bars, but because the opening price was too low, buyers rushed in. HSBC quoted British bills at 1.25 and American bills at 0.25. The foreign exchange market once trended favorably. Citibank once bid for April US dollars at 28.5625, but it rose to 787.7 taels. However, due to weak confidence, large accounts dumped one after another, and foreign exchange bills were issued vigorously in the same industry. Although the bank's appetite was still healthy, it was difficult to reverse the wild run. Although the April US dollar was lowered to 28.625 yuan, it could not be sold, and the gold price saw a tragic fall again. Chang Sheng Yong and Heng Yu competed to sell first, and Guangbang Yifeng set an example later. In the morning, it fell to 81.4 taels and was slightly stable. In the afternoon, it continued to fall downstream. In addition, foreign cables reported that the general psychology in the New York market was optimistic about prices, and sellers became more diligent as a result. The gold industry vigorously stuffed US dollars, but no hedging strips were seen, so the price could not be supported. The April US dollar loosened to 28.9375 yuan, then broke 80 taels again and fell to 774.8 taels before the falling trend stopped. Finally, it closed at a price of 777.6 taels. It can be seen that the downward trend was fierce in one day, and there was an unstoppable trend. The main reason is the international relations, such as the economic conference, war debts, reparations, etc. Among them, war debts are particularly pertinent. Although the exchange rate has soared for several days, if the war debt conference is as requested by the debtor countries, then there is no doubt that the exchange rate will continue to soar. Large accounts cannot grasp it and are selling off one after another. In addition, the market situation is extremely depressed, and it is not easy to sell strips. It is difficult for general bulls who want to sell off to advance or retreat. The Central Bank once opened 252 spot bars in the morning, but only dozens in the afternoon, which was done by the spot numbers Tong Feng and Heng. The maximum price was 87 taels, and the minimum was 76 taels. The swap spread was 1 tael, and the transaction was not much. Now, the situation during the day will be recorded separately below.</p>
<p>The opening price fell by 6.9 taels to 784 taels, which was 6.9 taels lower than the previous closing. It was sold by Da Xing Yong, totaling about 200 bars. It was then 3.8 taels. The bank's opening prices were 1 shilling, 8 pence, 0.1875 for recent British exchange and 28.375 yuan for US dollars, but US dollars were firm at 0.125. Although the opening price was low, buyers rushed in even more. Heng Yu first entered at 85 taels. The opening price of goods was 786 taels, so hedging also came to enter strips, rising to 6 taels. Yifeng and others slightly purchased to 7 taels. Dade Cheng sold to within 7 taels. Yuan Mao also sold to about 6.5 taels. Dade Cheng sold again, then retreated in order to 6 taels. Heng Xing also issued more than 100 bars for 5.5 taels. Da Xing Yong sold again and saw 5.1 taels. Banque Sino-Belge entered March US dollars at 0.5 yuan. Tian Feng Yong, Wan Xing, and Qian Chang Xiang all came to enter strips, adding to 7 taels. HSBC quoted British bills at 0.125 and American bills at 0.25, which seemed appropriate, and the price also stabilized. Heng Yu issued strips, falling a few cents. Dade Cheng also slightly sold out at 82.1 taels. Although Wan Xing entered to 7 taels, Yong Feng sold, with slight concessions. Heng Yu and Wan Xing continued to purchase, and it was then to within 7 taels. Citibank took in April US dollars at 28.5625. Bing Xing came to enter, and it rose to 7.7 taels. The goods' selling plate was small at 1 tael. Qing Fa Yong came up to enter strips, reaching 7.7 taels again. Zhi Feng Yong sold to within 7 taels. April US dollars at 28.5625 had no one wanting them and were at 5.8 taels. Qian Chang Xiang came to enter, coaxing to 6.6 taels. At this time, people's hearts were still stable, and the falling trend had not yet appeared. After lingering for a long time, Chang Sheng Yong came to issue, returning to within 6 taels. Heng Yu also sold to 5 taels. April US dollars, even at 28.625, could not be sold. Heng Yu and Chang Sheng Yong scrambled to sell, and it fell to 3 taels. Zhao Feng Chang also issued, but could still support it. When Guangbang Yifeng suddenly came to commit a blockage, it was only to 2 taels. Dade Cheng and others came to replenish, circling to 3 taels. However, Yifeng continued to sell, and retail investors followed the trend to sell off, falling to 81.4 taels. After entering, it was close to closing. Dade Cheng still came to add strips, then to 2.5 taels. Finally, the afternoon closed at a price of 782.2 taels. Goods were auctioned at 82 taels, showing a slight suppression.</p>
<p>The low peak was 74.9 taels. The afternoon opened immediately low at 781.5 taels. The spot number Ying Feng Heng came to sell, but the number was not large, but due to the retail investors' suppression of the price, it then fell to within 81 taels. Qian Chang Xiang and Zhi Feng Yong sold out at 80 taels, because the gold industry was still continuing to block. Heng Xing slightly bought foreign exchange bills for 79.5 taels. Before long, it still issued outside 80 taels. This month's US dollars were already at 28.5 yuan, which was 0.125 firmer than the afternoon closing. Hongli and Yuan Mao Yong sold to about 79 taels. Heng Yu and Yuan Heng issued vigorously for 78 taels. Dade Cheng also issued for 7 taels. April US dollars at 28.875 could not be sold. Heng Xing came to sell, retail investors followed the trend, and 75.5 taels were seen. Banque Sino-Belge took April US dollars at 28.875. Yong Feng entered strips for 77 taels. Wan Xing also purchased, then issued outside 8 taels, and for 8.3 taels. Zhao Feng Chang also entered strips at this time, and the price then stabilized slightly. May US dollars were already at 29 yuan. Although there were buyers, people's hearts were tired. Circling and small. January US dollars at 28.625 were definitely settleable. Yuan Mao Yong and Da Xing Yong sold to within 76 taels. Hongli also issued, and in addition, there were buyers who were willing to issue May US dollars at 29 yuan in the same industry, and it fell to 74.8 taels. After this, buyers became slightly active, and the selling trend also stopped, and there was more circling, between 75.5 taels and 76 taels. Then Zhi Feng Yong's spot number Da Feng Heng came to enter. The Central Bank had the act of opening spots, but not much. April US dollars at 28.9375. Banque Sino-Belge and others all took them, which were sold by the gold industry's Fu Chang and the Dalian Gang. The price then circled and rose to outside 77 taels. Transactions gradually became dull. After entering, Tongtai Chang came to enter, and in addition, goods were active, rising to outside 78 taels. At this time, it was pressing close to closing. The long and short sides suppressed and raised each other, sometimes rising and falling by a few cents. Finally, it was still raised to close at 777.6 taels, with a dangerous act of double closing price. Goods were also raised to close at 78.8 taels. It can be seen that the highest price during the day was 787.7 taels, and the lowest price was 774.8 taels, with a difference of 12.9 taels. As a result, it fell tragically again by 13.3 taels compared to the previous closing. The posted price suppressed 6 taels weakly. The posted price was 28.8 yuan because the US exchange rate HSBC quoted a long price of 0.25, and the combined bid price was 857.14 taels. In terms of the closing price, it was about 79 taels, more than 6 taels weakly suppressed compared to the previous closing. Because the strip amount in January had been cleared, it was not recorded. February was 784 taels. March recorded 782 taels. The supplementary water was 782 taels in the morning and 778 taels in the afternoon.</p>
<p>There was a sound of selling off in the market. Transactions were oversupplied. Statistics show that Yifeng, Ruikang, Zhi Feng Yong, Dade Cheng, Yong Feng, Chang Sheng Yong, and Zhao Feng Chang were all sellers. Bing Xing, Qian Chang Xiang, Heng Yu, Wan Xing, Yuan Heng, Rui Xing, Tian Feng Yong, Zhen Chang Xiang, and Qing Fa Yong all entered. Among them, Yong Feng, Zhao Feng Chang, Dade Cheng, and Heng Xing issued first and then entered. Hongli sold more in the afternoon. The spot number Ying Feng Heng issued. Tong Feng Heng and Da Feng Heng entered slightly. Bing Xing squeezed in more than 600, of which 630 strips were drawn to Chang Sheng Yong and Shen Kang. Guangbang Yifeng issued more than 400. Heng Xing issued more than it entered in the morning, and entered more than it issued in the afternoon, generally balancing out. The Dalian Gang Wan Xing always entered strips. Shunli entered a small amount slightly. The strip amount in March up to the previous day totaled more than 18,700 strips. There was a price but no transaction for cooked red. Yesterday's cooked red market was extremely deserted. Neither buyers nor sellers were seen to take action. The silver shop gang was especially absent due to the year-end closing of accounts. Only the price was known in the market, but no transaction was seen. The price was generally calculated according to the addition of 10 taels and 5 cents. Because the spot numbers were also closing down tomorrow, there was not much profit, so they also did not take action.</p>
<p>In the swap market, the short side pasted 1 tael. Yesterday, the swap for February to March was 1 tael pasted by the short side Yuan Xin Yong to Dade Cheng, totaling 77 transactions. No other transactions were heard. In the afternoon, Yong Feng and Heng Xing only did 35 drawing account strips for February, which were solved by Yong Feng on behalf of. The spot price in January was flat. The strip amount in February up to the previous day still had 3,325 strips remaining.</p>

<p>Yesterday's foreign cable London long bill was long at 0.0625. The exchange rate rose by about 1 point, so the opening price of British exchange was 1 shilling, 8 pence, 0.1875, the long silver price of American silver was 0.25, the bank's private cable rose by 0.375, the forward silver price was long by 3% to more than 4%, and American cotton was also large. The opening was then firm. The recent opening price of US dollars was 28.375 yuan. It was known in advance that HSBC quoted British long prices at 0.125 and American long prices at 0.25. The bank's appetite was still strong, and it was once seen tight, but because there was room for reversal in the war debt issue, the exchange rate was expected to continue to be long. Large accounts in the gold industry sold off, and the exchange bills were blocked, and the momentum was urgent, so the trend was loose. Citibank and Banque Sino-Belge absorbed vigorously. Although it was loose in the morning, it could still maintain the initial opening price. In the later market, foreign cables reported prices, and the New York market had the intention of seeing higher prices. The gold industry was still vigorously issuing, and the gold price and the foreign exchange market had an unstoppable trend. April US dollars were traded at 28.5625 yuan in the morning and to 28.9375 yuan in the afternoon. The trend of looseness was regrettable. Gold companies such as Fuchang, Taikangrun, and the Dalian Gang Hongli sold off unanimously, which was quite a large amount. About 600,000 in the morning and about 500,000 in the afternoon, totaling more than 1 million. Banks such as Citibank, Banque Sino-Belge, Mercer &amp; Co., and Toyo Menka Kaisha all accepted. In addition, they all entered more than they issued. Shillings were slightly issued by the bank. There was a 0.1875 (shilling) and 0.375 (US dollar) rise and fall during the day, but the result continued to be firm. British exchange was 0.1875 firmer than the previous closing, and US dollars were 0.4375 firmer. British-American exchange was traded for the forward price, with May at 3.39 and June at 3.395. The banks sold shillings and entered US dollars, all of which were done by the same industry. Now the price of both sides entering and exiting during the day is recorded on the left.</p>
<p>(British exchange) The recent opening price in the morning was 1 shilling, 8 pence, 0.1875, which was flat with the previous closing. Although British silver rose, it had already been done the previous day. Citibank sold to Banque Sino-Belge for May at 1 shilling, 8 pence, 0.3125. Banque Sino-Belge then sold to Yokohama Specie Bank for January at 0.1875. The afternoon closing price was from 1 shilling, 8 pence, 0.25 to 0.3125. The entry price was from 0.3125 to 0.375. In the afternoon, Anjin sold to Banque Sino-Belge for May at 0.5 pence. Mercer &amp; Co. also issued the same month at the same price. Afterwards, American Express also blocked out May at 0.5 pence. The closing price for January was 1 shilling, 8 pence, 0.375. The entry price was 0.4375. February was the same. March was 0.4375. The entry price was 0.5 pence. April was the same.</p>
<p>(US exchange) The recent opening price in the morning was 28.375 yuan, which was 0.125 firmer than the previous closing. The gold industry always blocked it out. Banks such as Banque Sino-Belge first took March at 28.5 yuan, and then entered Yin Gong Si for April at 0.625. Citibank peeled April at 0.5625. Mercer &amp; Co. also entered the same month at the same price. Banque Sino-Belge and others successively entered April at 0.625 many times. The afternoon closing price was from 28.375 yuan to 0.625. The entry price was from 0.4375 to 0.75. The looseness was abnormal in the afternoon, because the gold industry was still vigorously dumping. In addition, foreign cables boosted the momentum. Citibank first took May at 29 yuan. Banque Sino-Belge, Mei Feng, and Sumitomo all took April at 0.875. Anta Datong peeled May at 0.9375, and then it was seen firm again. Mercer &amp; Co. and Mitsui both purchased May at 29 yuan. Finally, Banque Sino-Belge and others peeled April at 0.9375. The closing price was from 28.6875 to 0.875, and the entry price was all added 0.0625. One US dollar equals silver 3 taels, 5 mace, 7 fen, 1 li, 4 hao, 3 si.</p>

<p>Copper coins returned to a long 14,000... Silver dollars were busy settling accounts.</p>
<p>Yesterday was the small New Year's Eve of the old year. All kinds of silver and money industries were extremely busy settling accounts, and the procedures for handing over and receiving were extended in turn. According to people in the industry, they must work all night tonight and tomorrow. Therefore, all kinds of silver dollar settlements are temporarily suspended from recording. The market price of silver cents in the early market was 7 mace, 1 fen, 3 li. The noon market changed by 0.25 cent, to 7 mace, 1 fen, 2 li, 7 hao, 5 si. The transaction of exchange transfer bills was 1.65 million in the early market and 848,000 at noon. Banknotes were 65,000 in the early market and 20,000 at noon. Outside market banknotes were 135,000 in the early market and 65,000 at noon. Checks were 55,000 in the early market and 15,000 at noon. Bank trading was 1.25 million in the early market and 1 million at noon. The silver interest rates in both the early and noon markets were the same at 5%, which was 0.03 better than the previous day. The drawing head was still white drawing. The small money house traded more than 500,000. The early market for Jiangnan small silver coins was 6 mace, 1 fen, 2 li. The noon market decreased by 0.025 cent, to 6 mace, 0 fen, 9 li, 5 si. Only 2,000 jiao were traded in the early market, and 5,000 jiao were traded at noon. Guangdong small silver coins plummeted.

<h3 id="e181">Silk and Tea: The London Tea Market Plummets <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>According to news from British merchant firms, the tea market in London has been extremely sluggish recently. Indian and Sinhalese tea merchants, seeing that the inventory is large, are all competing to sell. Chinese Keemun black tea is also mostly stranded due to the impact of cheap competition from Indian and Javanese tea, resulting in the price of each tea market falling again and again. Since January, the selling price has been 0.03 or 0.04 lower per pound than the average last year, which is equivalent to about 20 taels lower per dan of Huayin tea.</p>
<h3 id="e182">Retrospect of the Yarn Flower Market in the Past Year (II) <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>The sales market for native yarn also promotes spring sales. The Cantonese people have a strong sense of patriotism and are actively involved in handling native yarn. Many other ports also participate. According to statistics, this port exported 44,182 bales of cotton yarn in January, 19,690 bales in February, and 8,526 bales in March. The outbreak of war in February and March caused a sharp decline in exports. Although the Shanghai battle had ceased in the summer, the domestic economy was bankrupt and the silk industry was declining, resulting in weak demand. In addition, the financial sector cautiously released loans, concentrating silver dollars in Shanghai, causing the foreign exchange rate to fall to within 70 cents (approximately 68 cents). Since inland sales were denominated in foreign currency, while Shanghai sales were usually in taels of silver, the price of each yarn piece was implicitly reduced by about one or two taels of silver. This situation was very unfavorable for yarn sales, and yarn prices also suffered a discount due to actual sales, leading to a drop in prices. The yarn exports for April were 12,433 bales, 44,885 bales in May (yarn market opening), and 19,592 bales in June. Since the autumn season, due to the adverse weather conditions for American cotton, the Bureau of Agriculture had theories of hoarding and insect pests. The Cantonese merchants first searched the market as much as possible, and pre-purchased yarn for the months of August, September, October, November, and December. As a result, the market was stimulated and prices soared. The spot price of 20-count "Ren Zhong" yarn rose from 152 taels to 164 taels and 5 mace. In one month, the spot transaction volume reached a huge 80,312 bales, setting the highest transaction record of the year. Afterwards, the market entered a calm state. In August, exports were only 27,869 bales, and in September, 23,427 bales. Japanese merchants resumed dumping tactics, competing for sales at low prices in the Yangtze River region. 20-count yarn was often more than ten taels cheaper per piece, and 42-count yarn was more than twenty or thirty taels lower. The north was the first to be invaded by them. Those who transported native yarn to the north were all occupied by Japanese merchants, leaving no room for insertion. Tianjin had a large amount of yarn in stock, and urgently sought a way out, even selling in Shanghai. In addition, American cotton also experienced a sharp price drop, and civil strife broke out in Shandong Province. Sichuan was originally a major sales area for our country's yarn, but unexpectedly, the two Liu's suddenly engaged in a fierce battle, the impact of which need not be stated. Exports were 24,709 bales in October, 22,789 bales in November, and 14,123 bales in December. The total transaction volume for the year was 362,482 bales, a decrease of 177,583 bales compared to the previous year. It is observed that the Shanghai cotton yarn firm industry is gradually being eliminated. Since the establishment of the exchange, all the achievements of the yarn market have been attributed to the futures market. Therefore, the power of yarn firms has been declining. For example, the retail stores in the Nanshi district and the wholesale yarn firms north of the Suzhou River have extremely limited business. Therefore, there are few new yarn firms established in recent years. Yarn factories such as Shenxin and Wing On see foreign yarn rampant in various provinces. In order to seek a way out, they have set up distribution and wholesale offices in major yarn sales areas across the country to compete with foreign yarn. There is also China Textile Corporation, which buys cotton and sells yarn at cotton producing ports in various provinces. The company is like the Japanese merchant's Dongmian Corporation. In addition, the larger yarn firms with larger import and export volumes, such as Yida and Fuji Hongxing, are all attached to the exchange (the yarn firms of various groups have been recorded in previous reports). The following is a list of the spot transaction amounts of various merchant groups in the 21st year for reference:</p>

<h3 id="e194">The Art of Not Asking <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>— Fearless</p>
<p>That day, after hearing the phrase "(If you want to eat squid, don't ask)" in a provisions store, I savored the words "(don't ask)" and felt that these three words are a kind of art of living.</p>
<p>"(Don't ask)" means "(Don't meddle in other people's business)". Indeed, one should pretend to be ignorant and deaf, and it's best to eat more and talk less in these times.</p>
<p>The so-called XX groups, etc., have now melted away, but not long ago, didn't these kinds of groups warn merchants in the east and throw bombs in the west? But the treacherous merchants are still stocking up, and the import of enemy goods along the Yangtze River is still increasing, while the passionate youths who did these things are already caught in the net of the law. Therefore, passionate youths, you should try your best to suppress your passion! Embrace the principle of "(Don't listen, don't ask)". It is most carefree, and those who worry about the country and grieve about the times are fools. In short, just eat, don't talk, don't listen, don't ask, no matter if the Japanese invade Rehe or Peiping-Tientsin, or even Nanjing, don't care. If people ask you why you are indifferent, you can just answer like this: We have a government in place, and the government is still calmly believing in the League of Nations. What business is it of us ordinary people to meddle in? The emperor isn't worried, but the eunuch is getting anxious.</p>
<p>Recently, supervising committee member X impeached so-and-so, which caused some questioning, etc. It's really looking for trouble for no reason. Perhaps committee member X doesn't understand this art of living?</p>
<p>Moreover, if you ask about everything carefully, it's truly annoying. A murder case may have many hidden backgrounds, and it's just that you hide it from me, and I hide it from you. If you don't know what's good for you and you go ask and meddle, you're sure to be rebuffed.</p>
<p>For example, when going to a foreign goods store to buy cloth, just buy it if the price is low and the quality is good. If you ask in detail, the result you get may not be satisfactory. Instead, you might encounter a "top" (we don't sell non-domestic goods), and maybe you'll see the clerk's awkward face. Your conscience will be pricked, and then you won't be able to buy cheap goods.</p>
<p>Therefore, in conclusion, the first thing to say is "(Don't ask!)" Friends! Are you willing to learn this art of living? However, although I write it, I hope that no one will want to learn this art, that's not against my true intention.</p>

<p>Severe cold, wind, rain, and snow spread, year after year, the year ends again. Looking up at the mountains and rivers, I grieve for the chaotic world, indeed, advancing or retreating is always difficult.</p>
<p>The country is like a melon, divided by powerful figures. The sores and wounds are all caused by the three dukes. Stealing life makes one envy the soldiers, dying on the battlefield is a good end.</p>
<p>The sound of the flute arises everywhere with sad songs, brave men march far away, pillows on spears at night. They fight to throw their heads once, relying on iron and blood to restore the country.</p>
<p>Ashamed to hide in the utopian Peach Blossom Spring, though survival is good, it's lamentable to be passive. Lying on firewood still performs demonic dances, saddened that my divine land is full of drunken people. (In response to assisting the righteous army)</p>

<h3 id="e196">Manufacturing Methods of Artificial Rubber <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>— Erming</p>
<p>Nowadays, there is no one who does not know what rubber is used for. This is because rubber has a soft and not easily damaged characteristic. Therefore, quite a few of our daily necessities are made of rubber. However, the demand for rubber products is very small, and the natural rubber is enough to supply the application. Until the production of automobiles, the wheels are all made of rubber. Therefore, the demand for rubber has increased rapidly, and the natural products are not enough to supply people's needs. So, a general scientist stood up to study artificial rubber to supplement the insufficiency of natural products and meet the needs of human beings. Now artificial rubber is popular in the world, but there are very few people who know how to make it. Therefore, the important ones are described below for the purpose of popularization. Those who are interested in research may also wish to check special manufacturing books to understand the mystery.</p>
<p>To make artificial rubber compete with natural rubber,</p>
<p>The value of the manufactured artificial rubber must be cheaper than natural rubber, and its quality is equal to or better than it. To solve all kinds of problems, one must start by studying the raw materials for manufacturing artificial rubber. Now, limited to space, I am sorry that I cannot describe it.</p>
<p>The most important raw material for manufacturing artificial rubber is Isoprene, but carbon oxides similar to this, such as Butadiene, a tetracarbon diene, can also be used. The method of manufacturing artificial rubber is nothing more than polymerizing Isoprene. The method is nothing more than placing Isopene or other raw materials in a sealed dish and warming it to a considerable amount of time to make rubber. The height of the temperature should vary depending on the raw materials used.</p>
<p>㈠ Manufacturing with Petroleum Spirit. Take an appropriate amount of petroleum spirit (petroleum spirit contains pentane) and use it to combine with oxygen to synthesize pentyl chloride. Then contact the pentyl chloride with roasted lime to remove hydrogen chloride. Then mix the obtained hydrocarbon pentene with oxygen chloride. The chemical reaction that occurs is only one trimethyl ethylene is separated, then it becomes 2-methyl-2-chlorobutane. If chlorinated again, 2-methyl-2,4-dioxy-tetracarbon alkane (2M) and 2-methyl-2,3-dichlorobutane (2M) are obtained. Add alkali lime to the last two compounds obtained to obtain Isoprene.</p>
<p>㈡ Manufacture with starch. First dissolve the starch in boiling water to gelatinize it, and then ferment it to form a mixture of normal butyl alcohol and acetone. Then use distillation to separate the acetone and add oxygen chloride to the normal tetracarbon alcohol to turn it into butyl chloride. Then add chlorine and oxygen to become 3,4-</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>Tetracarbon alkane (1,4-dichlorobutane), its boiling point is extremely low, if it is passed through red-hot alkali lime, it will immediately turn into a tetracarbon diene. Tetracarbon diene is extremely easy to gasify, so it must be cooled to become a liquid. The method is to use solidified carbon dioxide and ether to protect the outside of the condenser. Once tetracarbon diene is obtained, methylchliride is used to compound it and Isoprene is formed. Although the rubber obtained by this method cannot be completely different from natural rubber, its quality is actually better.</p>
<p>(Three) Manufacturing with coal. Place coal and lime in an electric furnace and burn it to obtain calcium carbide. When calcium carbide is added to water, Acetylene gas is immediately released. If acetylene is combined with water and mercuric chloride is used as an accelerator, Acetaldehyde can be formed. Oxidation will turn it into acetic acid. Acetic acid and Sodium Soanride undergo a chemical reaction to become Sodium Acetone. Adding tetracarbon acetylene gas to copper ketonide can obtain Metfylbutiol. Changing Methylbutiol to Methylbutenol, contact the final methylbutenol obtained with Magnesium Sulfate to produce sopeneo.</p>
<p>㈣ Manufacturing with wood chips. Dry distill the wood chips to obtain the acetone contained therein, and then use a pot to change it into aluminum salt and IsoProPenol. Hydration yields aluminum and Pinacol. Removing two water molecules from Pinacol can yield Dimethyl Butadiene. Polymerizing dimethyl tetracarbon diene yields rubber. Fermenting sweet potatoes to produce acetone is also often used.</p>
<p>The manufacturing of Methylrubber W is to place liquid dimethyl tetracarbon diene in a double-walled dish and raise the temperature to 70 degrees Celsius. After five months, the dimethyl tetracarbon diene contained in the dish will turn into a solid, greenish-yellow rubber. W is the abbreviation of German Weib, which means soft. This type of artificial rubber is suitable for manufacturing soft utensils.</p>
<p>Methylrubber H is named for its hardness. Its manufacturing method is also to store dimethyl tetracarbon ene in a thin-walled tin dish, and then raise the temperature to 30 degrees Celsius. After three months, a white, porous coagulum is formed. This kind of rubber is very different from natural rubber, but its use is very large.</p>

<p>"Hey! Old Zhang! The whole back playground is frozen and icy. Let's go play ball on the snow," Old Chen, who never liked playing ball, suddenly became excited today. He automatically took off his silk cotton robe and called out to Old Zhang, who was sitting at his desk preparing for chemistry.</p>
<p>"Okay, anyway, there's no exam tomorrow."</p>
<p>They excitedly came to the back playground and saw that Old Cheng, Old Tan, and others were already playing vigorously.</p>
<p>"Oh! I really can't take it, I've slipped five or six times," Old Tan said as soon as he saw them, opening his dog mouth and barking wildly. Originally, Old Tan's nickname was Ah Huang.</p>
<p>"I think it's okay not to play ball, but what should we play? Skating without shoes," Old Chen changed his original intention.</p>
<p>At that time, Old Zhang discovered something and shouted wildly: it was a broken desk, lying upside down on the snow.</p>
<p>"Come on! Let's push a snow sled, I haven't played this for many years."</p>
<p>"Okay," Old Cheng hurried to the dormitory upstairs and took the rope for tying luggage.</p>
<p>Everyone worked together, and finally the snow sled was completed. "How interesting! An uncultured person is sitting on the snow sled with peace of mind," this was said by Old Chen five minutes later while sitting on the sled. At the same time, Old Cheng was carrying it with a rope in front, Old Zhang and Old Tan were pushing in the back, and several other classmates were laughing beside them.</p>
<p>But happiness always leads to sorrow, the annoying disciplinarian came.</p>
<p>"Hey! Why are you destroying public property?" The disciplinarian walked over, grabbed the rope, and insisted on calling them to the disciplinary office together.</p>
<p>"What are you talking about? The desk was already broken," Old Chen, feeling wronged, jumped off the desk first and negotiated with the disciplinarian.</p>
<p>"Why do you want to pull my rope? This is not from the school." Old Cheng has always been</p>
<p>"I want you to go to the disciplinary office," the disciplinarian was unwilling to show weakness.</p>
<p>"We'll pay for your desk, how much? Put it on our account, anyway, each of us has two yuan of compensation reserve," Old Tan was also angry.</p>
<p>"Go to the disciplinary office? I'll go with you," Old Zhang said.</p>
<p>"I want you to put down the rope," Old Cheng used the strength of an ox to snatch the rope from the disciplinarian's hand.</p>
<p>"Are you guys dare to hit someone?" The disciplinarian was simply helpless and said this to save face. "We want to hit you? It's okay to go to the disciplinary office," instead, Old Zhang wanted to go.</p>
<p>When they arrived at the disciplinary office, the disciplinary director felt that it would be very embarrassing to give them a demerit because they were students with high grades. As a result, they were lectured, and the four people jointly compensated for the desk, which totaled six yuan.</p>
<p>Winter vacation has begun, and everyone received a warning letter. They laughed and said: This is the reward for pushing the snow sled, a fearless person, at this point, his hair stood on end in anger.</p>

<p>"It's very clean here, please sit down." The resourceful waitress Wang in the XX Theater saw two young tourists approaching and hurriedly greeted them.</p>
<p>"Please sit down, gentlemen!" Her words stopped, followed by her flexible eyes darting a glance at them and showing a smug smile. She used her soft fingers to gently push them on their shoulders, sending them into the chairs. Lu, who embraced hedonism, took advantage of the situation and slid into the chair; he couldn't help but laugh loudly and roughly. "Tea? Black tea, green tea, or chrysanthemum tea?" "Don't want any tea." Zhuang had suffered a loss in the amusement park once, and he knew that the place was full of scams. Even if you drink a cup of the cheapest plain water, you will be charged two cents.</p>
<p>"Do you like chrysanthemum tea? Oh, sir, wipe your face!" She finally brought two cups of chrysanthemum tea and squeezed out two hot towels.</p>
<p>"Sir, please help, you don't care about spending a few dollars, thank you." She warmly entertained them. She had wavy hair, shiny black eyes, a peach-colored face, and rosy lips, all of which could ignite Lu's heart. So he mustered all his courage and started chatting with her.</p>
<p>"How much business can you do in a day?"</p>
<p>"Quite a bit, we can sell hundreds of cups of tea in a day, but we have to split it with the accounting department."</p>
<p>"Oh! We can earn five or six yuan a day."</p>
<p>"It's very hard work, busy day and night."</p>
<p>"Then why don't you look for a better job?"</p>
<p>"That's right. Sir, if I abandon my current job, how can I maintain my life? Can society give us a better job? Of course, that's another question. Especially in today's society, it's even more difficult for women to find jobs."</p>
<p>"What's your real motivation for coming here? I want to ask blindly."</p>
<p>"To be honest! My hometown is far away in Shenyang. When the September 18th Incident first started, our officers did not resist and offered the land || that is, our hometown, to the violent Japanese with both hands. So I fled to Shanghai with my old mother. My younger brother, seeing that the lost land has not been recovered, wants to win back a bit of personality for our nation, and has already joined the righteous army!" Her attitude was very angry and tragic. "Speaking of which, because I can't leave my rice-wasting mouth idle, I have exhausted my relatives and friends and tried every means to keep my job here." Zhuang heard her words, especially the sentence "(He wants to win back a bit of personality for our nation)", and he suddenly felt ashamed and without a place to stand. He thought, Yuguan has now fallen, and Japan is urgently occupying Rehe, which is also in a serious state. Recalling the loyal and brave volunteers in the Northeast, they are fighting a desperate battle with the violent Japanese in the icy and snowy land. They have no warm clothes to wear, no reinforcements... So a nameless sadness arose in his heart again! He, Zhuang, no longer had the heart to listen to the opera, and pulled Lu's clothes angrily and said:</p>
<p>"Go back! Pay for the two cups of chrysanthemum tea and go back!"</p>
<p>They left the noisy amusement park and went down from the cage-like elevator.</p>

<p>— Jin Huan</p>
<p>On a snowy night, there were no people on the road, only the cutting cold wind, fluttering goose-feather-like white snow, shrouded around me. At this time, I braved the wind and snow, courageously moving forward, while admiring the dignitaries and wealthy people, who were warming themselves by the fire.</p>
<p>"Friend! Friend!" These two short and urgent sounds suddenly stunned me. Looking closely, I suddenly found a big man blocking my way, and several heroic figures also窜ed out of a dark and narrow alley next to me. My heart suddenly became anxious, but then calmed down, preparing to be pig-skinned once! "Friend: Be sensible!" a young man in an overcoat said to me!</p>
<p>"Friend: Since you are a friend, please help me!" I answered like this:</p>
<p>"What! I want you to be sensible, but you want me to help you!"</p>
<p>"I'm sorry! The robe is borrowed, and you can take the four cents in my pocket to buy a cigarette."</p>
<p>"Joke: You underestimate us too much, we are not thugs!"</p>
<p>"What joke! I really don't have money!"</p>
<p>"Don't pretend to be stupid, we're going to be rude!"</p>
<p>"Friend, then wait for me to untie it and let you search, okay?"</p>
<p>"Joke! What do you take us for? To be honest: don't get the wrong idea, this is not for us to use!" Then who is it for?</p>
<p>"Haha: I'm donating on behalf of the Northeast Volunteer Army!"</p>
<p>"Then I've donated several times already!"</p>
<p>"Sir, you are enthusiastic and patriotic, please spend some money this time!"</p>
<p>Before long, the hat, scarf, robe, and watch were all transferred in one breath in the midst of enthusiastic patriotic voices, and everyone dispersed in a hoot of laughter, saying "(Come and get the receipt tomorrow)!"</p>

<h3 id="e201">The Stepmother Problem (II) <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>Dear Editor: Since the birth of (Clerk Communication), I have wanted to raise my question and ask for your advice; but because of my lack of talent and knowledge, I did not have the courage to write. Finally, the desire for knowledge overcame my shame. Today, I will write this letter to you shamelessly: If there are any incomprehensible or wrong characters, I hope you will forgive me for being a person who has not even graduated from elementary school, and give me corrections.</p>
<p>I am twenty years old this year, and logically it is an era of striving for progress: but because of the influence of a bad family and the oppression of a bad environment, I have to be pessimistic and negative.</p>
<p>My loving mother passed away ten years ago; the subsequent stepmother was extremely fierce. I can't bear to recount the suffering I suffered in my childhood. Now, although she faces me with a crying face, she is secretly trying to arrange me!</p>
<p>Men should marry and women should marry when they are old enough, which is of course the inevitable path in life. Unexpectedly, she came up with a strange idea and insisted that I marry her niece. Generally speaking, cousins becoming husband and wife is the best thing; but she advocates this saying, but there is another effect in it! She has now given birth to four children, the oldest of whom is only five years old: seeing that my father, who is over sixty years old, cannot always protect them, she came up with this method to bind me.</p>
<p>Now her family is very good, and my maternal uncle and others have a lot of face in Shanghai; my current business is all in their hands. She expects that I dare not be willful with the rice bowl, so she insists on her ghost plan; she is afraid that if I marry another woman, I will not be able to cooperate with her, and if the woman's family is also powerful, then my business may not depend on her brother.</p>
<p>Now I want to break away from the scope of the family and maternal uncle, etc., but in this snobbish society, the future is also very bleak: in case I fail to find a job, wouldn't I become (want to be successful, but can't be successful)? Sir, in my situation, is it better to endure it? Or is it better to find a way out? I hope you can give me guidance as soon as possible. (The following is omitted) Respectfully, Yu Kunfu.</p>
<p>···············</p>
<p>Editor's note; Yu Jun's letter, at first glance, seems to include two issues, marriage and career choice. But after detailed research, the reason why he refuses to marry his cousin, and is eager to break away from his maternal uncle, is nothing more than to get rid of his stepmother's control, so this is purely a stepmother problem.</p>
<p>When Yu Jun's biological mother abandoned her, his father was already over fifty years old, and Yu Jun was only ten years old. If his stepmother had not come to take charge of the family affairs, then his father would not have been able to take care of both his career and his children; if he had taken care of his children, he would not have been able to take care of his career. We have to recognize that she is a contributor to Yu Jun's family. A chicken's skin cannot be glued to a duck's body. Although Yu Jun cannot treat her as his own mother, he cannot treat her as a stranger after all. Now she is seeking perfection for the sake of future livelihood, and her heart is also very bitter. The way of Confucius is loyalty, Yu Jun also seems to should let go of his previous grievances and treat her with courtesy in order to please his father. As for the marriage issue, Yu Jun certainly has the right to decide for himself, but it must be based on the other party's character and knowledge, and there must be no other prejudice mixed in. We also believe that if he can marry the niece of this stepmother, it can also avoid the general conflicts between mothers-in-law and daughters-in-law seen in society, which may not be Yu Jun's lifelong blessing.</p>
<p>As for finding another job, then it should be determined based on whether there is hope in the current position. Moreover, for the sake of prudence, it is best to adopt the method of (riding a horse while looking for another horse to ride). There is no need to hold the concept of (cannot live here for a day) simply because the current position was recommended by the stepmother's brother.</p>
<p>Westerners have a proverb that says (everything looks blue when viewed through blue glasses). Yu Jun's view of his stepmother may also be in this situation; therefore, he feels that everything about his stepmother, and even everything that is slightly related to his stepmother, is more terrifying than poisonous snakes and fierce tigers. I hope you can quickly remove these blue glasses and get along with your stepmother in a calm and peaceful manner.</p>

<p>— Wang Zhongxian</p>
<p>㈢ Having her can really prolong life by a few years</p>
<p>Miss Daiqiu | Ruohua's daughter | unknowingly followed her to Xia's family as a dowry. Because Xia Zhongnan had no biological son, she took the Xia surname. The girl grew up smart and lively. Except for Mrs. Xia, the whole family liked her very much. Zhongnan loved her like a pearl in his palm. After entering the door, he immediately sent her to school until Zhongnan stepped down and returned to his hometown, just leaving school life.</p>
<p>Zhongnan's first wife! Her temperament is stubborn, and her heart is narrow. She is completely a typical old-fashioned woman. She originally had a liver pain problem, and when it flared up severely, she would faint from the pain. In the past, she only fell ill once or twice a year, but since Ruohua entered the door, the number of times she fell ill has gradually increased - although Zhongnan and Ruohua did not dare to invade her, she imagined the annoyance herself.</p>
<p>Zhongnan pampered that stepdaughter, and Mrs. Xia was also very jealous when she saw it, often scolding her as a bastard in front of the servants. In front of the first wife, the servants were only allowed to call Daiqiu's name, and no one was allowed to call her Miss. Maosheng was not liked by the first wife, but in order to compete with Daiqiu, she deliberately showed her love and praised him extremely highly. Using this pair of children, she could vent her anger and insult Ruohua. Ruohua wanted to resist many times, but Zhongnan restrained her.</p>
<p>The first wife praised Maosheng to suppress Daiqiu, but Maosheng was an unpromising thing: not only was he not as smart as Daiqiu in studying, but he also often did many nasty things, making the servants look down on him. The first wife was also often angered by this son and developed liver and stomach problems.</p>
<p>The fifth master followed his brother in reading while in office. Ruohua knew that Zhongnan loved this younger brother the most, so she treated him especially warmly, caring for him in every way. The fifth master was very grateful in his heart and said to Ruohua in front of his brother:</p>
<p>(The eldest sister-in-law is like a mother, and the second sister-in-law is not the eldest sister-in-law, but her heart in caring for me is really the same as my loving mother.)</p>
<p>(Fifth brother's words are really killing me! We are all one family, and we are also far away from home, so we should take care of each other. You are young and studying hard outside. In the future, if you are successful, it will also be the glory of our Xia family. If the elder brothers and sisters-in-law don't take care of you, do we teach outsiders to take care of you? Fifth brother's polite words are not like one of our own!)</p>
<p>(Having her, ah...) Zhongnan sat on the sofa and said to Youzhong with a smile; (Having her can really prolong life by a few years. I don't have to worry about everything in the family, and she has already taken care of things I didn't think of. It makes people feel comfortable in spirit!)</p>
<p>(Second sister-in-law, what a pity!) Both Ruohua and Zhongnan stared at Youzhong, listening to him continue: (What a pity she is a woman! Otherwise, she would have the talent of a governor.)</p>

<p>Related to the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway</p>
<p>The 1932 Shanghai car registration numbers have been announced, and the number has increased compared to previous years. Therefore, car dealers are not discouraged by the war last spring and the economic downturn. Although this increase cannot be compared with the years when business was booming, the total number of car registrations in the Public Concession and the French Concession reached 15,365 by December 31, 1932, excluding military vehicles. This is an increase of 544 vehicles compared to previous years. Since the opening of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway on October 10, 1932, car dealers in Shanghai have been very satisfied with their 1933 business forecasts. The Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway, including the national highway leading to Nanjing, has a total length of 350 miles for driving. According to the China Automobile Club, the second road paving project will be completed, and heavy vehicles will be able to pass through by May 1. There are also 400 miles of motorways near Hangzhou that are used daily. Although the completion of this road will not lead to a sudden increase in the number of cars in this city, many car dealerships along and near the highway have purchased used cars from Shanghai.</p>
<p>Recently, car users in Shanghai have improved their standards for cars compared to a year ago. As a result, there are fewer old and dilapidated cars on the market. Streamlined vehicles, which were once popular, are also plentiful here. Light vehicles have been quite popular recently because they are cheaper to buy and have lower monthly expenses. The amount of gasoline and lubricating oil they use is far less than that of larger cars. Vehicles manufactured by British factories are the most famous, but French, German, and Italian ones are also quite good.</p>
<p>In 1932, Ford still ranked first in Shanghai car registrations with 1,399 vehicles, including those manufactured by Ford's British factory. Morris surpassed Buick this time to take second place with 1,094 registrations. Buick had 1,008 vehicles. Chevrolet was in fourth place with 825 vehicles. Austin was fifth with 668 vehicles. Studebaker was slightly weaker with 562 vehicles. Fiat, a car manufactured in mainland China, ranked seventh with 541 registrations.

<p>According to official statistics at the end of last year, there were a total of 3,289 freight vehicles in the city, compared to 3,370 on December 31, 1931, a decrease of 81 vehicles. When considering these figures, one point must be noted: a freight vehicle must be registered and taxed in two places when in use. Statistical disputes often arise due to overlapping. The number of freight vehicle registrations in the Public Concession decreased from 1,935 to 1,823, a decrease of 112 vehicles. The French Concession increased by 31 vehicles, with numbers of 1,435 compared to 1,466. This number may indicate an increase in freight vehicles in the French Concession, but it may not necessarily be a decrease in the Public Concession, as some car owners in the French Concession may not renew their Public Concession vehicle licenses. However, the freight vehicle business in the French Concession has indeed increased. The Ford and Studebaker brands have slightly declined compared to the past. The increase in Thornycroft Stevens vehicles indicates the development of the public transportation business.</p>

<h3 id="e204">Astonishing Performance of the New Standard Car <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>Two Thousand Miles of Travel in Nine Days</p>
<p>The latest Standard cars have been greatly improved in terms of manufacturing. Therefore, there are often astonishing results. Recently, a new 46-horsepower sedan was driven on rough roads, traveling 2,000 miles in nine days. The driver was Mr. Walding of the British Automobile and Motorcycle Association. According to reliable sources, this new car has already arrived in Shanghai and is on display in the showroom of the China Automobile Company. Its advantages are that it is fast and the parts are durable. The strength of the parts and the durability of the materials are essential advantages of Standard cars, and the new car must have even more improvements.</p>
<p>Another matter worth mentioning to the readers is that, in fact, from the moment the Standard car starts to the moment it reaches its destination, there are no obstacles whatsoever under any circumstances. When Mr. Walding tested the car, he drove it for nine days. Finally, he drove into Clingoe territory, in the Scottish region, which is perhaps the most dangerous place, and it is difficult for ordinary travelers to pass through there. However, in recent years, the authorities have built a highland road with a spirit of fearlessness, under difficult and arduous conditions. Only then have a few tourists traveled through it, but sometimes dangers still occur.</p>
<p>Between Augustus and Inverness, the driver had to drive south of Lochness. Glen Doe used to be a terrible mountain. When the driver reaches this mountain, he will inevitably feel terrified. Recalling several years ago, many light cars were driven on the mountain road. At that high place, they all had to be pushed by manpower. This time, the Standard car had no difficulties and drove safely. Even in dangerous places, it only used second gear. The soil along the way was loose and the air was fresh, which was especially suitable for the driver. The winding mountain roads, the crisscrossing rivers, the intermingling of water and clouds, and the villages standing side by side, all kinds of scenery cannot be described in words. In Inverness, a 2.6-ton six-cylinder Citroen truck, newly purchased by the French Water and Electricity Company from the French Da Automobile Company at 424 Avenue Joffre, is used to repair overhead wires.</p>
<p>In the journey of 2,000 miles, the roads passed were uneven. If the vehicle driving did not have considerable performance, it would not be able to reach its destination. There were many cars traveling together, and as a result of the journey, the performance of the new Standard car was the best, which is truly admirable. Moreover, when the car was running, not a single drop of water was added to the radiator. In other aspects of the parts, there were no defects that caused the car to stop. Even when driving at the highest speed on the worst roads, there was no excessive heat. Therefore, even in cold places, after stopping for a long time, there were no obstacles when starting. This kind of performance is not easy to see in ordinary cars.</p>
<p>The nine-day trip was quite interesting. On the first day, he traveled to Whafedel, which is halfway between Brough and Coldfell. Cars, motorcycles, and bicycles formed a line and drove through it, which was the most dangerous area. After Coldfell, the road surface was flatter and the danger was reduced. The driver was more at ease. After that, he passed through Kirkby, Tan Hill, and Alston, and from Saltaire to Melrose, he passed through Otterburn and Jedburgh and entered Scottish territory. Then the ground was flatter and a safe speed could be used.</p>
<p>When driving along the River Tweed and within Melrose, it suddenly rained that day. When driving in the rain, the beauty of the Standard car's body made the passengers sit comfortably in the car without feeling any discomfort. It was even more remarkable. In the evening, he arrived in Carlow. The rain was even heavier. All industries in the city were shut down. There was already a plan to stop moving forward. However, the Standard car, because of its perfect roof, could prevent wind and rain and drive safely. Two days later, he arrived in Inverness, passing through Aviemore and Grantown-on-Spey, and then reached Granton-on-Spey, which was also a rough road. However, the beauty of the scenery along the way was rare. Inverness, as a city in the Highlands, was regarded as the center point during the test drive. He drove for two days. Then, due to environmental reasons, he drove south and reached Ballater, which was a newly built road. (To be continued)</p>
<h3 id="e205">Record of Three Car Accidents in One Week <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>

<p>There were a total of eight car accidents this week. Among them, one boy died from serious injuries. One man, one woman, and one girl were seriously injured. One man had a broken leg. Two men had minor injuries. There was one collision.</p>
<p>▲Correction: The Chrysler six-cylinder double-use bulletproof armored vehicle is still the first of its kind in Shanghai. A photo of the new car was published in the previous issue of this publication. However, the owner of the new car is Mr. Yu Zhendong, Chairman of the Board of Jiangnan Bank and Chairman of the Board of Shanghai Printing and Dyeing Company. The previous issue mistakenly identified him as Mr. Xia. This is hereby corrected.</p>
