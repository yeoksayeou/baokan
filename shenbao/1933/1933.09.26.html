<h3 id="c23">美蘇復交與蘇日近勢實 <a href="#c23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>美國與蘇聯恢復尋常國交之説。在去年民主黨與共和黨競争選舉期中。即已喧騰於世。其所以未能見諸事實者。則以美國與帝俄時代之债務關係與其不欲冒險直接投資於蘇聯之故。然自一九三一年胡佛總統發表延期支付賠欵戰債而後。世界經濟。㣲特無來蘇之望。歐洲情勢。反愈惡劣。德國賠欵。固已無力支付。英法諸國對美戰儥。亦已瀕於擱淺。（英雖在目前勉强照付。伹已表示以後碍難繼續。法則已公言不付。）於是美國在海外凍結之資本其數非區區帝俄時代借欵與少數油田股票可比。况蘇聯僅不還舊債耳。其於新債。則從未失信。均能如期償付。因此美國一般投資家。對之皆具好感。此即美蘇後交之先機。而亦即美蘇兩國間五千萬美金棉麥借欵開始提議之要因也。</p>
<p>美蘇兩國在經濟上本少絶對衝突。而最近四年來。資本主義經濟。日見衰退。以歐洲諸國之先進國家。尙且無力付債則其他各國可知。然而今日之美國。絶不能不開拓海外市塲。發展海外投資。而拘於閉關自守。今蘇聯雖爲美國銀行界所不願交往之國家。而處此情况之下。自不能不在海外讯　一出路。是以美蘇商務關係。遂由疏還而漸趨接近。由接近而漸圖恢復國交矣。美蘇國交之恢復。非特在經濟上爲趨勢所必然。即在政治上時機。亦將届成熟蓋太平洋上之競争。遠東市塲之奪取。爲今日世界第一注目之問題。北美合衆國無論如何和平。决不肯任日本之獨霸。更不肯就此抛棄其在遠東之利益。然而美國决無實力以制止日本之發展。雖有龐大之海軍。亦難橫渡五千餘浬而對日作戰。在此嚴重對立形勢中。美國在東方。不能不尋求一有力之同盟者爲助。一面打開其經濟上之難局。一面圖脫其政治上之險境。此則除對蘇復交外。殊無第二途經可尋。</p>
<p>蘇聯在此時期正努力於國内之建設。孕育其國力之成長。故雖屢受極度之欺凌。亦惟有暫時忍受。而不肯輕啓釁端。不過其忍受究有一定限度。自中東路問題發生。蘇聯已再三讓歩。而日軍則强力進逼。於是口舌之争執。筆墨之肉搏。已至山窮水盡。昨日蘇聯政府公報「伊斯維斯太報」對中東路問題揭發日人之陰謀。其措詞之强硬。世界驚爲從來所未有。是亦可見蘇聯已至忍無可忍之時。於此而言美蘇復交。蘇政府當然樂於接受矣。</p>
<p>斯時之日本則何如彼自退出國際聯盟以後。外交早成孤立。經濟亦走上絶路。自以爲救急之法。惟有軍事上之猛進。使東北四省完全在日本軍事勢力統制之下。則對美不患無辦法。對蘇亦有强固之根據。是以一面圖擾我關内。一面即唆令滿洲傀儡。急急攫取中東路。同時擴大宣傳蘇聯移兵防邊。以刺激其麻醉中之民衆。近於所謂充實軍備以外。不惜破毁華府條約。實行増加常備兵四個師圑。此四個師圑。即將常駐於束三省境内。借口所謂日滿軍事業定書。實際乃置重兵於東三省中蘇交界之邊境。此種情勢之所趨。試問國際間將成何景象。我國寗能不預爲凖備耶。</p>

<p>（日内瓦）　國聯行政院主席挪威首相摩温克今日在大會開會時對於世界經濟會護與軍縮會議發表明白直率之言論、謂兩個大會在比較上皆屬失敗、其理由或可得而言之、集許多國家而欲其一致同意、獲一協定、其事本實困難、新曙光或可發現、而解决之穏健基礎或可覓得、但實在結果迄未成就、其所以然者、因事前未能貝有堅决力量之各國間植立合作基礎也、此種有力量之國家如不同意、决不能獲得圓滿結果、如經濟會議中穩定幣價之争執、即斯證也、此言亦可適用於軍縮會議、軍縮會之失敗、致引起如軍縮會一事無成而遽结束、則國聯威望是否損多一益少之問題云、</p>
<p>提及遠東、主席又言及遠東争執、謂國聯雖屢做誠摰的努力、但終未能造成較好之局勢、此種事實、確未能在世人心目中鞏固國聯之地位、且將引起較歐洲情勢所産生者尤爲惡劣之感想、戰後十五年、吾人覺趨向谋取各國人民間較好的諒解、較清朗的空氣及較穩健的心理之進歩、依然極微、此實吾人之恥也、不獨進歩極㣲、而戰争可能性之思想、且常留戀於吾人腦海中、彌漫於各國、視爲將來之大患焉、國聯前爲世人寄其極大希望之圑體、今若是、世人責備國聯、不獨勢所必至、且亦理所當然云、（二十五日路透電）</p>
<p>改選主席、大會繼乃選舉主席、投票結果、出於意料之外、南非洲代表華特竟在五十三票中獲得三十票當選、至前所預擬之墨西哥代表拿傑拉則僅得二十票　現知英國各海外自治領地及斯坎第那維亞半島各國、至最後時間始爲南菲代表作運動、故有上項結果云、華特最近數月中會屢次發表演説、攻擊日本干預東北事務、以此見稱於時、德氏當選後、就主席座、當向各國代表致謝、並聲明願以公平態度出之、</p>
<p>通過議程、至是大會稍憇後復開、通</p>
<p>過議事日程、决定成立五種委員會、令於午後分頭開會、各自推舉主席、至大會本身、則定於午後五時三十分繼續開會、選舉副主席、（哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>虐猶問題、照今日形勢、似德國對待猶太人問題、將在會塲内引起劇烈争辨、捷克與波蘭今春即欲脅迫國聯大會討論少數民族條約普遍適用問題、使德國猶太人獲有亞利安族日爾曼人同等待遇之保障、今各地猶太人已紛紛請願國聯干涉德國之排斥猶太人、設法人之與盟國家再欲推波助瀾、頓可成極端劇烈之争辨、惟照今日會中情形、似將僅此一事足使空氣緊張而已、（國民電）、</p>

<p>美麥尙未裝運已電美商减價</p>
<p>經濟委員會改組下週可成立</p>
<p>華北財政有辦法宋暫不北上</p>
<p>財政部長宋子文、前日由京來滬、接洽要公、將於下週返京、昨日下午二時、宋氏在寓、接見各報社記者、對美棉麥之推銷、經濟委員會擴組、華北財政等重要問題、發表談話如次、</p>

<p>宋氏談、首批美棉、最近即可到滬、此後分批絡續運華、出售已定有辦法、係委託中央銀行經理、另延人推銷、負經濟責任、隨賣隨解、非直接售與廠商、此事旣係商業性質、至日商採購、自亦不能禁止、而政府與廠商完全合作、外傳美棉將免征關税、及貶價出售、盡係謡言、總之、政府於購進售出、求兩不吃虧而已、今後售出棉價、視國内棉花産最及紗市如何而定　至美麥價高、會要求美方略予貶價、已有允可趨勢、現尙未裝船、遲數月始可來華、</p>

<p>— 慎言</p>

<p>（摩登）　究竟是怎麽個「天經地義」，可就有些不很容易懂。千金小姐，整天的裏在衣服裏，躲在閨閣裏，把嬌容纖手「養得雪白，説是「落伍」了。熱帶上的女子，終年裸身赤足，除了前後二陰，一絲不掛，把渾身皮膚，曬得烏黑了，又説是「未進化」。惟有冬季裏裹着大衣，躱在家裏烘火爐，水汀，夏季裏赤着胳膊，露着大小腿，才算是「摩登」。那麽，「摩登」，似乎有些「既落伍，又野蠻」的意義。</p>
<p>專説中國話，似乎不漂亮。專说外國話，似有甘爲洋奴，不愛祖國的嫌疑。若能在十句中國話之間，雜上一句二句外國話，或雜上三個五個外國字，那麽，又漂亮，又愛國，十足「摩登」。所以「摩登」似乎又有「不純粹與混亂」的氣味吃「大饒饝」，「棒子麵」，那是「山東老鄉，」就只夠在馬路上使刀，弄棒，賣解，變戲法。吃「麥糊」，「麥栖飯」，那是「臭郷下人」，不登大雅的。但若從伙食公司裏去買了「麥片」，或是麥做的「麵包」當飯吃，不用説得是黄種人中少有的「摩登人物」。那麽，「摩登」似乎又可作爲「盲從」解。</p>
<p>男女結合，丽須花紅六禮，明媒正娶，已一致承認是「迂腐」的了。不用花紅六禮，不須大媒大妁，男女相悦而同居，意見不合而分拆，又是「下流」的，名爲「軋姘頭」。若是男女相悦而實行非「軋姘頭」而又非「正式結婚」的「同居」，却是最「摩登」的方式。那麽，「不尷不尬」，似乎也可算是「摩登」。　　「上吊」，「吞火柴頭」，「吞金」，「服生雅片」等「自殺政策」，谁都知道是十九世紀式的了。「服安神藥片」，「跳黄浦」等玩藝兒，這一程子，也不怎麽博得人們擁護了。惟有從飛機上跳下來自殺，才算是一九三三年的秋季自殺法，中再也「摩登」不過的。所以「摩登」的定義、似乎也可以説是「殘忍」。</p>
<p>「希奇古怪」，算是「摩登」，「不近人情」也是「摩登」，但我終於找不出一條「摩登」的「天經地義」來。</p>

<p>— 程兆翔</p>
<p>我們四個人静静地蜷伏在東港海灘邊矮小的漁舍裏，等候那陰歷八月十四夜的夜潮。缺一邊的月在東海盡頭升起，灰色的雲停住在天空，海水砰湃地向東追去，浪嘯着，細草的灘，一直就在寂莫的漁舍下伸展開去。淦立起身開了臨海灘一面的小門，望望天外，又不耐煩似的踱回來在黄沙土的屋地上打轉，敏和銓斷續地談着獵的經騐，我獨自一個靠門坐着，月亮漸漸地照進屋裡來、海面上像有無數的銀蛇在舞動，隱約看見遠處的帆船成一黑點。大家等着潮之來臨，好獵取隨潮浮進來的雁。</p>
<p>暫時忘了城市的繁思，來到這孤寂的海濱，好似做了個出世的高僧，這光明超脱了另一世界！輕的海風吹過蘆葦，蕭蕭的，有一種爽的情感浮上心頭。</p>
<p>水草浸没在祗剩有梢的時候，知道潮水已經來了，我們起勁起來、四人分做兩隊，我和淦合做一起，躱在漁舍後的屋簷下，敏同銓赤脚背着槍和彈藥離開漁舍七八十步岸盡頭一堆蘆葦裡藏着，各自約定吹唇爲信號，誰先看見鴈，夠得住發槍誰就先發槍。</p>
<p>其實鴈這類鳥最有團結力，只要你有一點點聲音給它們聽見，它們就得一聲嘯飛了去！不容易等候它們再近來，它們起初只有一隻守望者到岸邊來探視，探視到没有東西侵害他們的了，纔敢招呼它的同類成羣的浮進來，但是很難得浮近岸來的，這次所以我們分爲二隊，也是怕它們不浮進來而預伏一枝槍在岸外呀！</p>
<p>時間一分一分的過去，鴈却不見來，我和淦都有點不耐煩起來，蹲在屋的暗處，重露濕了頭髪，身上有點寒意，潮一聲聲打在岸上，却不見半隻鴈影，好不心焦！</p>
<p>突然，淦的目光注意到很遠的海面上，一大羣的鴈飛過了！有好幾隻住了下來，然而離岸很遠，却不浮進來，糟！這時我們槍的射程决不能射到這樣遠的鴈身上，只好耐着，耐着，</p>
<p>希望它們浮近來，我想敏那邊總看見了吧？</p>
<p>這當兒，我們很焦急，恐怕它就這樣的不進來，不就糟了麽！正想着，忽然喳喳地又飛來了三隻，離岸四十密達光景，撲通一聲還没住定，接着那面蘆葦裡拍的一聲，很清脆的震盪在空的海面，回聲過來重又揚開了去。其餘的鴈突然驚得撲起重的翅膀，掉身飛去，不容你再有續發槍彈的機會，一隻傷的鴈在水面上打旋轉。</p>
<p>我和淦歡呼着奔了過去，敏坐在蘆葦裏褪彈聲，銓問我們「現在鴈是打着了，却怎樣將它弄到岸上來！灘水很深誰下去呀！却怎麽好」？</p>
<p>終於敏答應下去，他不怕水，他會游泳，他用了很多的氣力纔將鴈弄上岸，回到漁舍裡，相助他擦乾了背，穿上夜服，体息了一會，離開了寂寞的漁舍。…………</p>
<p>一路談着，很快活，明月在頭上追隨我們。風悄悄的吹過郊野，楓林，露水在頭髮上凉，衣服上濕而重，秋的草，没有聲，没有息，給露水浸着。</p>
<p>四個人連同那隻鴈，在八月十四的中夜明月下趕路。</p>

<h3 id="c245">論「女學生」 <a href="#c245" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e245" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">245</a></h3>
<p>— 許欽文</p>
<p>現在一般報紙的社會新聞上，常常載着「女學生」這個名詞。讀書的呌做「學</p>
<p>生」，讀書的女生呌做「女學生」，好像没有什麽問題。不過讀書，從前士農工商的四民中，只有士才做這件事情，所以一經讀過書，便永遠可以稱做「學生」了。在實行普及教育的地方，個個人都讀過書，因此「學生」這名詞，就限用於正在學校裏讀書的人·，否則未免太寛泛，同「人」的稱呼一樣籠統了。由此説來，「女學生」當是正在學校裏讀書的女子。然而事實不然，報紙上所稱作「女學生」的，竟有從未讀過書的太太。有一個朋友告訴我，他的嫂子一個字也認不得，也被報紙稱作了「女學生」。考查她被這樣稱呼的原因，無非是短髮，革履和長統襪的關係。可見這種所謂「女學生」，只是服裝新式的少女的意思。　　據説稱她作「女學生」的那個記者，固然不會同她談過話，也没有探聽明白她的身世，只是遠遠的望見了她一下，就去做起新闻來。這雖然只是一件事情，但這種事情未必限於一件，總是目前報紙情形的一種了。　　本來，老太婆是過去的「女學生」，小姑娘是未來的「女學生」只用「女學生」這三個字，根本有點不妥當。新聞記者喜歡多用這個名詞，大概也是爲着迎合一般讀者的心理。如今所謂「女學生」的，好像都有着兩條粗壯的腿，會拍網球，打排球，還會在水中游來游去·，會髙聳着小嘴巴唱歌，又會飄動着旗袍跳舞。在禁欲主義的舊禮教的環境中生長的男子，多少總有點色情狂，看了這樣的「女學生」，難免骨頭發鬆，魂不附體了。伹在只因爲遠遠望見了短髮革履和長統襪就認作「女學生」的，這樣神經過敏，可知對於眞正的「女學生」實在來得疏遠·，老婆和娘都是黄脸小脚婆，也是無疑的了。</p>
<h3 id="c246">讀「南遊記」 <a href="#c246" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e246" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">246</a></h3>
<p>— 小雪</p>
<p>「南遊記」一卷，清太原孫嘉淦（懿齋）著，張邁刊本。據張跋，這是「文定公生平快意之作」，曾經「善化賀公輯入經世文」，但「經世文」所載的差不多删節過半，他怕此文「闕佚」，所以據文定公原稿「重寫付梓」。計正文二十九頁，跋一頁，每頁十一行，行二十一字。在開始，作者首先説明他南遊的動機是·，已亥之夏，以母病告假歸省，其秋遂丁母艱。罔極未報，風木餘悲·，加以荊妻溘逝，稚子夭殘，不能鼓缶，幾致喪明。學不貞遇，爲境所困。欲得寄跡山水这間，聊以不永懐而不永傷焉。詩云··駕言出遊，以寫我憂，此之謂也。</p>
<p>孫嘉淦的出遊，完全是流覧景物，「以寫我憂」，因此，這一部紀遊文，它的優勝處，也就在簡鍊的景物叙述方面了。他這一回的南遊，經過的地方很多，路線也很長。從北京出發，首先是遊山東。他叙述泰山的一段，頗有些令人神往。他寫的是··</p>
<p>途中矯首欲望東嶽，而適微雨。雲山歷亂，時於雲外見高峯，以爲是矣。曾不數里，又有高者。午後見一峯甚高，怪石突起，烟嵐擁護，謂必是矣。已而川勢東開，山形北轉，遠而望之，更有高者。蓋予從泰山之北來，午前見背，午後見臂，至泰安州，始當其面。而又值雲封，故望而未之見也。</p>
<p>遊過了山東各重要的地方，他繼續着旅程，就到了江蘇。經過揚州，鎭江，玩過天方，金焦諸山，到蘇州，這個地上的天堂。但是，他所得到的印象是怎樣呢？在日記裏，他寫道·。</p>
<p>姑蘇控三江，跨五湖，而通海關門内外。居貨山積，行人水流，列肆招牌，燦若雲錦。語其繁華，都門不遠。然俗浮靡，人誇詐，百工士庶，殫智竭力，以爲奇技淫巧，所謂作無益以害有益者也。</p>
<p>蘇州給他的印象，是不很好。於是他遊過了名勝，太湖，就「南出吳江，由藍溪到浙東嘉杭之間」，這一帶，他是滿意的，他的印象，和在蘇州得到的，是完全的相反·。</p>
<p>其人善蠶，地皆種桑。家有塘以養魚。村有港以通舟。麥禾蔚然，茂於桑下。静女提籠，兒童晒網。風物清幽，與三吳之繁華又别矣。</p>
<p>他爲什麽不滿意蘇州，而在這樣環境裏感到滿意，在這兩節對比的描寫裏，是很容易看到，一是由於作者的思想的，原因，一是由於作者的田園詩人的情趣較濃厚罷。由此到杭州，在西湖上大大的玩了一回，就繼續作衢州行。這一帶景物的叙述，較之湖上生活的描寫，我覺得是優勝得多。他寫的是·。</p>
<p>自杭州溯浙江至於富陽。富陽之山，雄壯似燕秦諸塞，而青翠過之。富陽以南，川勢漸窄，兩山對峙，一水中流，羣峯倒影，上下皆青。出橦梓關，勢漸開。遠近布列，山皆妍媚。桐君山陡立江岸，其南内拓開一平原。石壁環峙，如天生城闕，則桐廬也。阻山臨水，居民在山水之間。瓦青牆白，纎塵不染。其清華朗潤。令人神往。</p>
<p>經過浙江，到江西，由江西往湖南，到廣東。後由廣東回至湖南，取道河南向北京。這一次的南遊，據作者自已説，是「四海濱其三，九州歷其七，五嶽睹其四，四瀆見其全」，在交通不便的時代，可以説是一大壯遊。他是··</p>
<p>二月出都，河北之地草芽未生。至吳而花開，至越而花落。入楚而栽秧，至粤而食稻。粤西返棹，秋老天髙，至河南而木葉盡脱，歸山右而雨雪載塗。轉盼之間，四序環周。　　這一部遊記，描寫景物，頗有優勝之處。惟篇中若干議論部分，却無往而不顯出腐行的道學氣分，令人感到不快。舟中無俚，讀此遣時，燈下復寫此記，也眞呌閒得無可奈何矣。</p>
<h3 id="c247">秋溪上 <a href="#c247" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e247" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">247</a></h3>
<p>— 石非</p>
<p>何處去尋秋？只有到清溪上的蘆花深處去··那兒年年總是深深地刻着秋的足跡。</p>
<p>在某一天夜裏，那溪上景色更加可愛··風静波平，好似剛用絨布揩過的玻璃。閃爍的星，晶瑩的月，一行兩行的飛鴻，都在水上印下牠們的影子。微風拂來，玻片似的水面皺了，化作𥻘𥻘的�</p>
<p>細波。兩岸的荻蘆，戴着銀白色的花，臨風搖曳着，像一個龍锺衰叟，獨立蒼茫，點着白髮蓬鬆的頭，在那兒品賞秋色。半枯的蘆葉，互相敲擊着發出輕微的沙沙的聲音，有似情人的切切私語這時候，有一位詩人，走出了他的象牙之塔，散步到這秋溪上來。他打算用靈感採取這裏的景物，豐富他的詩的收穫。</p>
<p>他捉住蘆花的私語，鎖住清溪的微波，籠住星月的光輝，停住長空的飛雁··一一放到他的詩中去。於是那詩從第一行至最末一行，都充滿了秋聲秋意。他以爲秋溪上的景色，已盡入他的網羅了·。鄭重地挾了诗篇掉頭歸去，不屑再對溪上一暼。</p>
<p>忽然，一聲欵乃傳來。詩人不自覺的回頭一望，却見溪灣深處搖來了一隻小舟。碧流拍着船舷，冷月曬着横槳，那坐在船頭上的一個剛被飛鴻喚醒的漁夫，衣襟上還沾了因風吹落的蘆絮。「大自然」把這溪上安排成了一幅頂玲瓏的畫圖，一片有生命的詩境。詩人，愕然的站住了。</p>
<p>「能陶醉於溪上的秋意的不是詩人，却是那睡眼朦朧的漁夫·，能描繪出溪上的秋色的不是詩篇，却是那「大自然」不可捉摸的妙腕！」詩人這樣想着，他的詩篇便從他的手中落下，一任那清風吹去，絶不惋惜的讓他零亂的飛散。這時，詩人的心上，才第一次感到一種不能寫在紙上的詩意與秋思。</p>

<p>二、查票</p>
<p>查票，大家當然都知道是怎麽一回事，但船上的查票，可就有點兩樣，因爲每一次查票，便好像是特意串演一齣悲劇，使你不忍看，又不忍不看。</p>
<p>這悲劇的演出是這樣的··一個船員。領着幾個船役，另外遠有幾個武裝而並不雄糾糾的「同志」跟着，和獵人搜索獸類一樣，邊走邊嚷··「查票呀，查票呀！」當然哪，這悲劇的主角决輪不到大菜間的紳士們和貴婦人們，也輪不到官艙裡的買辦先生們，就是房艙這一中間堦層的旅客們，也不常輪得到，主演這一悲劇的，十分之十是統艙裏的衣衫襤褸，面有菜色，從都市裏失望歸來或是從農村懷着金色的幻夢到都市去的一羣。</p>
<p>查票者從大菜間而官艙，而房艙，聲音愈喊愈大，他們知道對待某一堦層是該適用某一種口吻，某一種態度。一到統艙，「查票呀」，那已經不是喊聲，簡直像是狂怒的咆哮了，船役和握有特殊力量的「同志」們，都抖擻精神，準備着，經騐告訴他們這裏準有許多的可憐蟲給他们實施　力，做他们椰揄，捉弄，開頑笑的對手。這時候，在這面有菜色之羣中，幸而有票的當然是謹愼地把票子從袋裏摸出來，没有票子的便會驚惶無措，頭低着，一聲不響，等待不可避免的禍事之到來。</p>
<p>「票子！」船役像霹靂一般的呌。「没……有，」一聲細微的嗫嚅着的答覆。</p>
<p>「猪　，没有票子好趁船，走，賬房去！」於是便有一個英雄像老鷹捉小雞一樣捉住那襤褸的衣領推向賬房去，順便，也許還可以聽得到一記清脆的掌聲。</p>
<p>「票子！」對另一個人問，那是戴着一頂灰帽，或是披着一件破灰衣的「退伍同志。」但摸出來的可不是票子，而是一張「放行條」。</p>
<p>這事情，可就輪到我們的「武裝同志」了，於是一位「同志」走進一步，「你爲什麽不買票？」「没有錢，銷差回家。」答語也是低低地。「賬房去！」結局照例是這樣。這樣，一個，兩個，賬房門前便擠滿了一大羣‘丨一羣静待判决的囚犯。</p>
<p>這兒，我們的賬房先生和班長同志便該出台了，照例，也是一個五個的問··「爲什麽不買票？」答語則是千篇一律，「没有錢。」</p>
<p>「没有錢好趁船嗎？」賬房先生狰獰地冷笑，班長先生大聲地喝駡，這可憐者之羣，總是静静地，誰也不作聲。</p>
<p>「搜！」賬房先生發出命令。幾個船役便捉住一個，剝開衣服，仔細地搜索，但搜索的報告，總是一文没有，有的也不過是幾枚銅子。（未完）</p>

<p>今天偶爾的翻開一本外國雜誌，上面載有一篇「林肯成總統的機會」一文，覺得頗有意思，他的叙述大概是這樣的··</p>
<p>這位歷史上有名的大總統林肯有一個兒子名勞勃脱林肯。他本來是在伊利諾州司不林斐爾特做書記官，在一八五九年往東方去投考哈佛大學。結果這位仁兄的程度實在太欠，一共考了十六門功課倒有十五門没有及格。他的父母不願意他再回到司不林斐爾特去，遂把他送往斐列潑中學去補習一年。在那裏他的成績倒很可滿意，不遇老林肯先生恐怕他兒子再要名落孫山，爲穏妥起見，遂决計往東方去看他一次。</p>
<p>那時他們家庭的經濟是很不寛裕的，老林肯先生遂不得不在各處演講以補旅費之不足。他在可不聯合會講的一次講演很引起了紐約城領袖人物驚奇的注意，發現了他的才幹。</p>
<p>起先在一八六０年總統競選的時候，最有把握的要算威廉西華特了。如果依了西華特方面的計劃，在星期四的下午投票，則其勝利必已屬於西華特無疑。然而因爲印刷所没能把選舉票簽凖時送到，遂不得不改在星期五的上午舉行。就在那個晚上林肯和開慕倫兩方的勢力講和了，於是林肯就在星期五的早上當選了總統。</p>
<p>後來，勞勃脱還時常很幽默的對人説··他父親的所以得被選爲總統實在都是他的力量。如果他没有這末許多門功課不及格，他父親决計不會到東方去的。如果他不到東方去，他就决不會被選。　　的確，這到是實在的，如果没有他兒子那次的失敗，林肯或許就默默無聞的終老故鄉了。那裏想得到他兒子的失敗，就給了他成爲總統·成爲歷史上一赫赫人物的機會。天下事竟是這樣的神妙得不可測的。</p>
<p>吾因之要勸勸吾可愛的青年同胞了，你們現在如果有什麽事情失敗，請你們千萬不要灰心，因爲你們的失敗或許正是你們父兄或你們自已成大人物大事業的機會。不過，反過來説，如果你們遭到了一件很得意的事情，請你們也不必過份的趾髙氣揚，目空一切，因爲你們這次的僥倖或許也就是你們父兄或你們自已將來身敗名裂的階礎。天下的事情實在是奇妙的！就像吾今天曾於無意中翻到這一段文字，使吾多轉了一個念頭，或許也曾和吾將來的命運有什麽關係，所以倒也不可説它是偶然的呢丨</p>

<p>幹嗎哭得這麽厲害？後房裏一大箱的玩具還不夠？還希罕甚麽？不　　的小東西丨</p>
<p>麻臉奶嬸嬸這時便説··「這原是席先生自已去引他的，小哥兒倒並不一定希罕甚麽丨…………」</p>
<p>「嘻丨小東西，你壓根兒没有看清了人頭丨…………」</p>
<p>在這樣的情勢之下再要問「主人在家嗎？」那可太不識趣了，這種聰明老席是有的。雖然，那樣嘴臉不是老席所忍受得下，然而老席也只有忍受了，躡手躡足出門去，氣白着臉回到家裏，不免咬齒拍桌嚷了一會，罰誓説從此再也不到「惜抱小築」了。</p>
<p>然而（再也不到「惜抱小築」了），僅是氣頭上的話。那「相當的機會」是老席所不能放棄的，壓根兒妻先不答應他放棄。</p>
<p>妻以爲以後再到「惜抱小築」去的時候，應當先要聯絡那「小家伙」的感情才好。</p>
<p>不幸的是老席竟至窮得連買可以聯絡「小家伙」感情的「好東西」的錢都没有。</p>
<p>女兒波波有一尊很大的「無鍚名產」的泥人，還是去年一個住在無鍚的表叔寄來給她的。因有波波没有像人家「後房裏一大箱的玩具」，這個「金頭紅臉」的泥人便成爲她唯一的愛若　寳的東西了。她給牠穿起了衣裳，戴起了帽子，她整天玩着弄着，牠是波波惟一的好伴侣。</p>
<p>妻的念頭忽然轉到波波的這個唯一的伴侣的上面··「把波波的那個泥人帶去哄那小傢伙吧丨」</p>
<p>「唔，？……」老席是不能同意妻的主張的，他愛波波，正和天下的父母愛他們的孩子一樣……。</p>
<p>「…………………」</p>
<p>「唔，也只有這樣吧．」老席也終於同意了妻的主張．</p>
<p>「………………」波波抱着那個泥人似理解非理解地瞪着小眼望他的爸爸和媽媽。．</p>
<p>妻向老席丢了眼色，又撅了撅嘴，顧自講别的了。</p>
<p>晚上波波睡着時，妻偷偷地拿了這個泥人裝進方盒子，放在一邊。</p>
<p>第二天，波波發現她親愛的泥人被竊了，兩頰急得紅紅的，問爸爸，爸爸答説不知道，问媽媽，媽媽説是不曾見見，波波悲哀地哭泣　　做媽媽的　　地勸慰着，爸爸呢，買了一個銅子的糖來塞在波波的口中，波波也就　然。做爸爸的　上了　衫，　了　　方盒出去了，説是替波波去買一好東西，波波高興得雙脚直跳··老席在離家的好　十步的途中，還聽見小波波快樂的呌着··「爸爸早些來丨」</p>
<p>冰琪琳的清凉鎭定了老席不安的情绪，他站起來重向「惜抱小築」走去。</p>
<p>他想，今天那小傢伙總該不會再　擾我了吧？那個麻臉的婆子總該不會再講冷話了吧？…啊，那麽好看又是那麽大的「無鍚阿福」……波波一定還在哭呢丨……不，我如果有了事，一定替波波買十隻……老谷今天總該有好回音給我……</p>
<p>老席想得心花怒放了，他彷彿看見谷太太歡迎的微笑，他彷彿覺得他已坐在一張紅木的辦公桌的前面了，説時　，那時快，老席異常鎭静地跨進了惜抱小築的前門。</p>
<p>一眼望見的就是那隻披髮的擺耳狗和奶嬸正在跟着他們的小主人在階沿下面玩。</p>
<p>老席輕輕的走近了他們，那孩子照例立刻歛起笑容哭嚷起來·，</p>
<p>「媽丨獃子又來了丨」</p>
<p>麻臉婆子撅起了嘴看别的，擺耳狗也發作了狂吠。然而老席今天倒並不感到窘迫，他不慌不忙地打開了紙盒，拿出金頭紅臉的「阿福」高高地托住空中··　　·别嚷，乖哥兒，今天帶了好東西來了！」</p>
<p>孩子馬溜溜地證着小眼睛，他馬上破递爲笑。甩飛跑到老席的臂膀下，拉着老席的長衫，</p>
<p>「什麽？什麽？給我！給我！」</p>
<p>老席微笑地將泥人交給了孩子，孩</p>
<p>子笑了，孩子的髙興，使狗和奶嬸轉變了態席，孩子的高興使老席覺得心頭掠過一陣光明。</p>
<p>孩子捧了泥人，高聲嚷着飛也似的奔向裏面母親，那裏去·。</p>
<p>「媽媽，好看的泥人！你看！」</p>
<p>砰的一聲，不知怎的，孩子絆跌了，泥人給打得粉碎，碎片嵌進了孩子的額角，額角殷然出血了，孩子哇的哭了出來。</p>
<p>「怎麽一回事？好端端的又絆交了」？做母親的斗的從裏面跑出來，「唔，奶嬸嬸丨誰又給他這個撈什子？他怎麽可以拿這個的……。」</p>
<p>老席的心頭突然沉下了一塊巨石，壓得他全身發抖。…………</p>

<p>因爲把這問題，作爲一個比較，這是多麽有趣的一回事啊丨伹是在下並不是食譜專家，他不是西菜廚師。所以未必一定能把這問題完全寫出，祗是把所知的詳細分析起來，作一個簡略的報告罷了！</p>
<p>又因爲各國的食，晚餐比較來的稍爲豐富而復雜一點，所以特把它作爲代表其他了。</p>
<p>美國從前在酒禁時間，餐室中或食堂裏都没有酒可喝·，所以除却多量的小菜和水果外，衹可喝些濃烈的牛奶茶或咖啡而已。可是在我們中國人所開的餐館裏，把茶壷盛着酒，偷偷摸摸地喝着·，因此中國人開設的餐館，在當時是極得美國人所歡迎的。伹是酒禁解了，他們也不必到中國人的餐館去了。至於他們所食的成分，多是牛酪，肉類，蛋白與澱粉質，和些糕餅之類。</p>
<p>英國則和美國差不多，不過他們的餐室裏多是没有酒的。</p>
<p>俄國和德國大致相同　，他們都是一盆湯，和兩盆或三盆的菜蔬和肉類。意大利則除湯外，祗有肉類兩類，而且是狠少，雖然是把它吃得精光，也是不能飽的。但他們的一盆湯中，不常也夾雜少許的食肉在内。兼且他們嗜食酸質的原故，所以三盆菜中都喜歡加入些醋。麵食也是常有的，此外，每一個星期中，還有吃米飯一次。</p>
<p>西班牙和葡萄牙，除郤一盆湯外，還有四種肉食，兼有冰類與糕餅，餅更特佳，水果也特别的多。匈牙利的湯中，帶雜肉類、頗具我們中國的風味，挪威則因爲地理上的關係，午餐常常没有的。晚餐則滿堆冷葷餅類於桌上，任由客人自取的，並没有限制·，堂倌衹有招待客人茶和咖啡而已。瑞典除湯及小菜</p>
<p>外，祗有一盆肉，但是蔬菜郤狠多，如果對於蔬菜不大喜歡的人，衹靠一盆湯和一盆肉，那是不夠吃飽的，但其中也有海鮮的滋味嘗試。</p>
<p>日本素廉儉的國家，他們晚餐和午餐是没有分别的。他們的飯量也是極少，普通除食飯一小碗外，小菜祗有一塊鹽醃蘿蔔，和一小碟的靑菜，上中的人家也不過多加半塊生魚肉罷了。至於其他肉類非有盛大的宴會時，絶不多見的。</p>
<p>可是在我們中國就和日本成一反比例。凡在中等以上的人家，午餐和晚餐所費的，數元，數十元，甚至數百元也不算冷奇。這筆令欵確足驚人。</p>
<p>通常各國的晚餐，恒在七時至入時。但西班牙常在八時半後·，德國在七時</p>
<p>晚餐，也是不常見的。因爲他們三時午餐，而晚餐不得不因此延遲了。我們中國人食無定時，公子少爺和姨太太們則早餐在十一二時，午餐郤變爲午後點心，而晚餐因延至八九時後。到了夜半一二時，還要吃一頓半夜飯纔去睡覺。這是一般的有間階級　有衛生的習慣·，在我們看來郤不足爲奇，而在外國人眼光觀之，没有不覺得詫異的啊！</p>

<p>立在××大學收欵處的前面，從腰裏摸出一百三十塊的鈔票的時候，我的手在索索的抖了。我的心裏發痛·，這是我父親汗血的錢啊！</p>
<p>拿了那張收條，我便想去注册了。不能，還要二十塊錢的制服費。我摸摸衣袋，衹有十五塊大洋，但這是我的書籍費。天哪，怎麽辦呢？可以免繳嗎？不可以。能夠緩繳嗎？可以是可以的，不過等到明天來注册，便要開始罰金了，二元錢一天！</p>
<p>没有辦法，繳了費，書是不能不讀的。於是，我跟中流着涙，馬上到住在上海的親戚家裏去借了。當我把這二十塊大洋的制服費繳進去的那時候，我的手又在索索的抖了。</p>

<p>校長··是，是，這幾天正是吃緊的關頭。對國家對民衆都要他負責任，所以……機要秘書……對呀，這幾天簡直忙不過來。</p>

<p>校長··能夠使日方諒解，已經是極大的功績的。不過就我個人的觀察，總以爲應當繼續抵抗。就目前的中國地位而言，我們對於這種嚴重的局面，只有三條路可走。一，直接交涉，二，收復失地，三，誓死抵抗。現在一般的人民，對於日本的仇恨，可以説是無以復加，所以現在的直接交涉，人民是極端反對，這是無容諱言的。……這不是説政府對於停戰的進行，處置失當，而是説人民過於義憤罷了。就收復失地而言，那末在軍械上和經濟上都没有充分的凖備，簡直是無所談起。機要秘書··對呀，是極，别人有飛機有坦克車有一切犀利的武器。我們什麽都没有，我們憑什麽來收復失地呀？只有那些完全没有軍事常識的人，才來唱收復失地的高調。</p>

<h3 id="c258">演員的技巧和導演編劇以及自已的環境 <a href="#c258" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e258" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">258</a></h3>
<p>— 炳颺</p>
<p>電影演員的技巧問題，如十五日本刊黄君如君所提出的。誠然是一椿重要的事情。因爲在攝製一部影片的時候，如果忽略了它，那變成新聞片了。</p>
<p>黄君希望批評者和觀衆們對這問題加以注意，這是很好的。可是在這之外，我以爲最主要的關鍵，還是在於導演者的才幹和經騐。</p>
<p>在拍取一部影片的時候，演員是受着導演者的指揮，這是盡人皆知的事實。一個平庸的演員，在一個幹練的導演指揮之下，可以表現出很好的成績··反之，一個天才的演員在一個蹩脚的導演底下，却往往埋没了他的本色。在好萊塢選拔演員的軼事中，這種的例子我們可以找到很多。</p>
<p>其次，在攝影塲上的許多其他條件也會影響到演員的技巧。比如以攝影爲例。在一個演員對於某一動作（臂如大笑）尙未盡情發揮之際，突然由導演那裏傳來一聲Ｃut，當然結果必定是出乎演員意料之外的圓滿。</p>
<p>除開如上所述的演員與導演的關係之外，那末演員與編劇之間也有着必要的鏈鎖，</p>
<p>在一般的情形之下，假如編劇者不從空想出發，而盡量提供生動的事實·，假如編劇者不從主觀的幻想出發，而能意識地懂得演員的種種實况·，那末這對於演員是有着極大的輔助的。想反，如果依照呆笨的脚本作出許多不必要的動作來，結果不但是演員被批評者與觀衆指摘，就是導演者也無可如何。</p>
<p>第三種條件也是必要的。即演員的環境問題。中國演員的環境不必説了，就説好萊塢演員們的吧。因爲電影事業是以追求利潤爲目的的，所以結局，演員不是當作「人」來使用，而是當作「機器」來消耗的。三年或五年的合同期滿了，你儘可滾蛋。在這種條件下的演員，唯一的希望就是多拍幾部影片·多得一些金錢。試想，在這種情况之下，他們還那裏有充裕的時間去研究脚本，揣摩動作，洞察心理？他們更那裏有充裕的時間去作遠大的藝術的深造？結局除去少數的爲藝術而犧牲者之外，恐怕多數都只成了導演者的應聲虫而已。　　以上拉雜地提出了三條意見。我的意思並不是要呌批評者和觀衆對於演員的技巧多少給與原諒·，我的意思是在指明一部影片未曾製就前，這幾個條件是非常重要的，否則單就演員的成績來批評演員，而忘了决定演員技巧的其他先决條件，我認爲是不公允的。</p>

<p>— 仲琴</p>
<p>費斯鮑文Ｆaith　Baldwin　是美國的藝術專家，好萊塢的影片藝術科學研究院請他做評判顧問，他的生活，天天在戲院中過，他對於演員的批評，無不中肯，以下就是他寫給各演員們的一些座右銘。</p>
<p>凱弗蘭茜絲··你是最多情的女子中一個，尤其在「情聖」中可以看出，但是，你的對白太勉强了，冷静一些，或者帶着小孩的態度是最適合你的。</p>
<p>埃第康泰，你是影界的主要人物，但是你的笑語是不自然的發抖的聲音，你的前途大有造就，希望你留意。</p>
<p>羅克·，無疑地，你同卓别麟的笑料是二類的，但是，卓别麟的作品處處含蓄着無限的意義，這似乎他比你高，請你注意。</p>
<p>卓别麟·，你近來的作品是鳳毛麟角了，我希望你再多做幾部，不要因爲做了富翁而賴於辛苦的工作。</p>
<p>加雷古伯·，你講的話音節拖得太長。我知道你没有脱去意大利土音之故，請多加練習。</p>
<p>弗利特立馬區·，你在「羅宮春色」之中，是恰到好處，但是我希望你不要摹倣巴里摩爾，他是他的作風，你不能學的。</p>
<p>凱絲玲海蓬··你的「棄夫」中的巍大是無需我的鼓吹，伹是我也看過你許多無台劇，我覺得你很能做一個諷刺的演員，所以我希望你不要再做棄夫中一類的角色，要發展你諷剌的作風。</p>
<p>愛麗莎蘭地··你切不要做妖艷的角色，你是個恬静和柔的女子，應當做恬静的角色，你也要太忠實了。</p>
<p>曼麗特蘭漱··你是極適合於運用慈心使大家同情，你在中間也很可以穿插，詼諧的笑料。</p>
<p>海倫海絲··好萊塢是很稱贊你美麗的，但是你的演影劇不是完全靠面貎的，這一點你應當認清。</p>
<p>散蘇畢茨··你工作的時間大多，以致生病，我很替你担心，我希望你以後不要工作許多片子，你可以注全力於一片，比多演又省力，又容易精，史都漢先生説你是悲劇家，我很同意，你如果可能，演一次悲劇試試，但是你在喜劇片中給大衆的印子太深了，或者你的面貎要改一改，化裝後拍，但是恐怕很費事。</p>
<p>克萊拉寶，你仍不脱天眞的熱，我希望你做一個少婦般的熱來描摹狂放不覊的天性，你年紀大些了，這是需要的，不能再學淘氣的小孩。</p>
<h3 id="c260">蓓妮泰漢的感傷語 <a href="#c260" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e260" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">260</a></h3>
<p>— 羅芬</p>
<p>英國明星蓓妮泰漢曾向人説··「電影界裏的人物，要希望成名，除了到好萊塢去是没有别的方法的。在倫敦，在巴黎，在伯林，在維也納，都不夠。凡是有才幹的，要不埋没他自已的天才，祗有到好萊塢去。」</p>
<p>蓓妮泰漢説這話是什麽意思呢？她並不是贊美好萊塢也不是因爲她在好萊塢受了美國人的重用而恭維牠。她説這話是很感傷的，現在先拿她以前所遇的環境説一説，就可以明瞭了。</p>
<p>蓓妮泰漢生長在英國勃立斯都。她的父親是一個律師，蓓妮桼漢自小總敏，從中學畢業後，她就入了音樂學校。後來又入倫敦的皇家戲劇學院。畢業之後，就在倫敦演舞台劇。</p>
<p>蓓妮泰漢在舞台劇界中，很不得志。於是别尋機會了。她在倫敦看到影界似可以一試，但是她到了影界中，因爲没有什麽聲名，所以結果同舞台上一般舞二，許久仍是一個極小的無名演員，她看英國的影界過於守舊，新進的人才是没有機會的。因此她又决定離開英國去找機會。</p>
<p>蓓妮泰漢初次出國，到了巴黎，她也是同在倫敦一樣，鬱鬱不得志。她離去巴黎而抵伯林，在伯林她起初没有機會跨入影界，及後考入烏發，因爲薪給很小，不久就辭職。她後來到了奥國京城維也納她也没有順利的一天，最後她又回到倫敦。當她遊歷各國的時候她聽見了不少關於好萊塢影業的話，所以，她决定要到好萊塢去，碰一碰機會。</p>
<p>果然她到好萊塢紅起來了，遂了她的志願，她在好萊塢，現在是第一流的外藉明星，她初到好萊塢，就在米高梅公司的Clear　all　Wires　一片中做了主角。她歎息着以前的遭遇，所以才有「祗有到好萊塢去方能成名」的感傷語。</p>
<h3 id="c261">影界中的美人標準 <a href="#c261" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e261" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">261</a></h3>
<p>— 炳</p>
<p>歐美各國的人，論到美人，大約分爲二種。一種黄金公頭髮，白晳面色的稱爲Blone　一種是頭髮棕黑色的稱爲Brunett</p>
<p>好萊塢的許多電影明星，不外乎這二大種標準。但是這二類標準美人曾有許多幸與不幸的變遷，當好萊塢影業最與旺的時代，所謂金髮美人占據了影界是最紅的地位，殆後機髮的女子又興盛一時而奪了金髮女子的地位。大約在六年之前，各影片公司，不論那一家都以椶髮美人爲選取明星的標準。那時的金髮女子都請美容家把她們黄金的頭髮變成椶髮色。</p>
<p>但是最近影界中的標準美人又以金髮占優勢了。據派拉蒙公司的報告，在有一部新片中拍攝一段夜總會的跳舞，所用的演員倒有五十個女子是金髮的。椶黑色髮膚的女子，只不過十人而已。　　據調查的結果，最近的五年中，金髮美人和椶髮女子，在影界中始終保留着平衡的地位，間有出入，但並没有十分的上下。這原因是很簡單的，因爲現在的化妝術精妙得很，可以使金髮美人及椶髮的女子隨意變化也。</p>

<p>派拉蒙公司著名的摜沙帽朋友賈克歐凱，他是一個最不服氣的人。他在派拉蒙公司常因爲待遇的關係而賭氣，因爲他的嗓子很好，並且他的電影藝術不差，所以他在派拉蒙公司中很受一般辦事人員的另眼看待。上次他在派拉蒙公司中攝「大學生的幽默」一片時，因爲有一天没有到派拉蒙方面要他賠償損失。他就立刻表示辭職。後來還是公司方面軟了下來。賈克雖然喜歡摜沙帽，然而他在平時很替公司方面出力，這次他擔任了派拉蒙的新片Too　Much　Harmony中的主角，因爲缺少一個老太婆的配角，公司方面十分因難，但是賈克歐凱從他的家裏拿他的母親拖了出來，介結他的母親擔任，因爲她在劇中演的恰巧是賈克的母親派拉蒙試騐之後，成績十分優異，所以正式聘請了她擔任，薪給方面因爲她是賈克的母親，不能比賈克小，所以按照賈克的薪給，在電影界中，有兄弟姊妹或夫婦同時在一部影片中合演，至於母子在一片中合演，則賈克歐凱母子二人尙屬創見云。</p>

<p>[P鏡花水月Three-Cornered　	Moon（二）&gt;</p>
<p>伊麗莎白想勃魯克林這種塵囂的地方，是與高雅的藝術家不相宜的·，但是將他安置在寓所裏最高的一層，屋子裏有那露體女子的油畫，窗外正對海濤，大概還可以對付過去。或者偶然的還有些意外的奢侈，以及家庭間的安適，足以使他忘懐於兇暴的房東太太，小飯店裏的汚穢布，以及廚房裏的蟑螂等等。伊麗莎白想起從前龍那德所受的種種磨折恥辱，很代他扼腕，並且希望從此之後，在她卵冀撫育之下，能成全了他的大志。</p>
<p>林柏加的家庭裏，正在亂得一團糟。遠是永久是這樣的，但是這次更特别些。林柏加太太，在她自已臥房的浴室裏洗她的頭髮，肥皂頭髮弄得一榻糊塗。留聲機器開得震耳地響。島格拉斯在大着衣鏡前空手學着剌劍。肯納斯在電話裏和他的愛人吵着嘴。還有那位小兄弟藹弟，身上還穿了昨夜的晚餐服，在箱子裏翻尋衣服，東西摔得一天世界，到處都是。伊麗莎白在樓上看了，歎了一口氣。</p>
<p>可是龍那德的房間裏，冷静得多了。打字機已經打開放在樓上。小説稿子，擲得滿床都是。伊麗莎白站在他的房門口。龍那德望着她，但她知道他並没有看見她，他所看見的是下一段小説中的情節，「急風暴雨，雷聲隆隆」之類的傑構，她很想坐在他房裏看着他，但她已往的經騐告诉她，雜人的吵閙是要使他的思想上起㣲妙的化學作用的。下面這般大孩子們吵閙着，留聲機器軋軋震着耳鼓，但是聲音忽然停止了。伊麗莎白下樓去看着到底是什麽事。祗見林柏加太太整理着她的濕頭髮，衆孩子們大家圍攏着看一張電報。林柏加太太喃喃自語道「什麽呌押證金·，那經紀人説還要多添些押證金呢？」肯納斯且不理她。他説「你們聽着，電報上説倘到今天下午兩點半鐘没有回音，你的户額就代爲結束了。母親，這到底是怎麽一回事？」林柏加太太很安閑地説··「連我還不知道呢。」肯納斯又喊道··「又是一個電報，上面説「至今没有接到你的回音，你的户頭已經賣掉了。」林柏加太太説，「這是最後的電報。」衆位孩兒們面面相覷着，齊聲問這··「到底是怎麽一回事？」　　林柏加太太雙手抱着大肚子，鄭重其事的點着頭説道··「這就是説從今以後我們要另尋生路吧了。」肯納斯手裏抓着電報紙。怒氣勃勃地向着他母親道「你爲什麽從來没有和我們提過？母親，我們眞的家產蕩然了嗎？我們還有股票没有？」（未完）</p>

<p>(Beiping) After Ji Hongchang arrived in Huairou, there was another military conference where a decision was made to disrupt the Pingjin (Beiping-Tianjin) area on a large scale. Fang's army was designated as the left column and Ji's army as the right column. The banners they raised included "Punish the Traitors United Army" and "Punish the Traitors and Save the People Army." Fang's forces advanced southward from Huairou, launching a sudden attack on Beiping. If they failed, they would flee back to the Yangcun, Wugou, and Sanhe areas to join up with Lao Haozi's bandit forces and attempt to cut off Pingjin transportation. Ji's forces, from the western district of Miyun, would attack Changping via Huailai and then move toward Beiping. Another part would attack Yixian from Huailai, attempting to cut off Pinghan (Beiping-Hankou) transportation. At the same time, many disgruntled military personnel in Tianjin were plotting to form the East Asia Alliance Army. (25th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Fang's and Ji's forces have been moving toward the Niulanshan area for several days. Now, there is a momentum of invading Shunyi County from various locations in Niulanshan. Fang's southward escape seems inevitable. Someone is planning to use the pretext of suppressing Fang and others to send a large army back into the war zone and, in disguise, cover Fang's advance, thereby instigating our internal war to carry out a major conspiracy to disrupt North China. The authorities are paying close attention to this and are prepared to deal a heavy blow if Fang's forces cross the war zone boundary at Shunyi and other places. (25th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Fang's infantry and cavalry, numbering about three to four thousand, arrived in Niulanshan yesterday afternoon. Fang himself also moved with the United Army Headquarters to that location. The soldiers are stationed in the Shawo and Lianghe areas near Niulanshan, where they are digging trenches and building fortifications, seemingly preparing to fight there. Several gunshots were heard north of Gaoliying last night and the night before, reportedly caused by sentries firing their weapons. Ji's forces have all entered Dashuiyu. On the 23rd, a large portion was still stationed in dozens of villages north of Huairou. Ji himself was at Gaojia, south of Huairou, where the United Army's left column headquarters was set up. About a thousand soldiers of Ji's Fourth Division are stationed in the vicinity. On the 23rd, they took over defenses at Qiaozicun, preparing for defense. Currently, there are no troops in Huairou city, only the remnants of Fang's battalion, which are being gradually moved out. It is estimated that from the 20th, when Fang's forces arrived, until the 24th, the local supply of provisions and fodder reached over 20,000 yuan in cash. The Huairou County Magistrate, Xu Wenquan, and the Public Security Bureau Chief, Wang Yunkui, were both replaced by Fang, who appointed a certain Liu as the county magistrate and Li Zhi as the Public Security Bureau Chief. Both Liu and Li are from Huairou and were previously under Fang's command. It is said that Liu Guitang's forces are outside Dashuiyu and will continue to enter Hebei Province. Fu and Tang's forces, numbering over four thousand, fled from Yongning to the border of Changping. This morning, refugees fleeing along the PingSui (Beiping-Suiyuan) Railway were incessant. (25th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Gaoliying reports that about fifty to sixty of Fang's and Ji's plainclothes troops were discovered near the north and south of Shicao, Gaoliying, last night. They fired over a dozen pistol shots and then fell silent. Ji's army has established three lines of defense south of Huairou: Beishicao is the first line, Qiaozicun is the second line, and Fengshan is the third line. (25th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Gaoliying reports that Colonel Yoshida, a representative of the Japanese Kwantung Army Headquarters, arrived in Miyun by plane from Chengde at 10:30 AM on the 24th. A Chinese national accompanied him. After entering the city, Yoshida immediately visited the representative of the Japanese garrison. (25th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Beiping) At 10:00 AM this morning, the No. 102 Beining (Beiping-Ningbo) train arrived in Beiping from Tianjin, carrying twenty Japanese soldiers with carrier pigeons. After disembarking, they went to the Japanese barracks. For the past week, a batch of armed Japanese soldiers has been arriving in Beiping from Tianjin every morning, numbering several hundred in total. (25th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Beiping) A regiment of Japanese troops has arrived in Miyun. It is the 23rd Regiment, complete with cavalry, infantry, and artillery. A large amount of ammunition was also transported with them. Many civilian houses and shops in the city have been occupied. The county magistrate, Sun Yutang, has been strictly ordered to provide provisions and fodder.

<p>(Beiping) A certain important person said that the authorities are aware of Fang and Ji's plot to disrupt Pingjin. Although Fang and Ji are using the cover of the demilitarized zone, preventing our army from advancing to suppress them, adequate preparations have been made. If Fang and Ji do indeed attempt to flee south, they can be annihilated in one fell swoop. There is absolutely no danger in the Beiping area. As for the rumor that Shang Zhen has been appointed as the commander-in-chief, it is not accurate. Because Fang and Ji are a motley crowd and not worth a major military advance, there is no need for a large-scale military campaign. (25th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Beiping) Regarding the resolution of the Fang and Ji problem in Huairou, after our side refused the Japanese side's request to send troops alone to drive away Fang and Ji's forces, the Japanese Kwantung Army sent a reply telegram to Beiping yesterday, still insisting on their original position: the Japanese side will be responsible for suppressing the bandits. Today is the deadline for Fang and Ji's forces to leave the war zone according to the Japanese side's order. It remains to be seen what action Fang and others will take and how the Japanese side will act. (25th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Beiping) Residents of western and northern Beiping are afraid of being affected by the war and are fleeing to Beiping in large numbers. Starting today, the police and military police in Beiping City have stepped up security. The east and west railway stations are conducting extremely strict inspections of passengers to prevent criminals from sneaking in and causing disturbances. Therefore, although Fang and others have the ambition to attack Beiping in the coming days, the authorities have made thorough arrangements, and there is absolutely nothing to worry about. (25th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Although news of Fang Zhenwu's army attacking Beiping has been received here, the people of Beiping have not shown any signs of wavering. The city gates of Beiping have now been reinforced with security teams and public security teams. All those entering and exiting must undergo serious checks, as it is feared that plainclothes troops from Fang's army may infiltrate the rear and cause trouble. Therefore, the number of patrols in the city has also been greatly increased, and pedestrians are subject to body searches at any time at night. (25th Japanese Allied News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Beiping) After Mi Dexin's forces of Fang's Fourth Army occupied Niulanshan, they immediately began building defensive fortifications in the vicinity. At 5:00 PM yesterday, Fang sent his guard brigade, numbering over a thousand, to Niulanshan. Currently, there are about three thousand of Fang's forces there, but their firearms are incomplete and they have no provisions, and they are extorting them from Fang. Long-distance telephone and telegraph lines between Beiping and Miyun are now damaged, so no news from Miyun has been reported to Beiping. (25th Special Dispatch) (Beiping) Shunyi reports that about a thousand more of Fang's bandit troops arrived in the Niulanshan area yesterday afternoon. Their firearms are incomplete, their clothing is disheveled, and they are harassing the area everywhere, causing great suffering to the residents. At 10:00 AM this morning, a Japanese plane came to conduct reconnaissance for a week and then flew southeast. (25th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Beiping) Fang's attempt to attack Beiping has been blocked by the Central Army's 25th Division, 2nd Division, and 117th Division, totaling 40,000 troops, south of the demilitarized line centered on Shunyi. There is no hope of success, and under the pressure of the Kwantung Army, they will inevitably flee east and join forces with bandits in Luan Dong. As a result, the demilitarized zone under the ceasefire agreement will become an increasingly concentrated area for bandits in the future. (25th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Beiping) The strength of Fang Zhenwu's forces: Wang Zhongfu, formerly of the 1st Army, a regiment of officers and soldiers who defected from Bao Gang's command, numbers over 900, with about 500 various types of rifles and 4 mortars. Mi Wenhe's 4th Army is composed of 10 bandit gangs, totaling over 700 men, with over 400 miscellaneous rifles. The commander of the 4th Division, Wang Xiangcheng, has about 500 men and over 200 rifles. The independent cavalry division, led by Li Xiru, has over 300 men and over 200 horses. Previously, when Fang was in Zhangjiakou, they called themselves the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Army. Now, they call themselves the Punish the Traitors United Army to the Japanese side and use the name of the Northwest Anti-Japanese Army internally. The strength of Ji Hongchang's forces: the cavalry division, led by Zhou Yixuan, has about 500 men and horses each, with over 300 rifles. The 2nd Infantry Division, led by Xu Fuzhong, has over 900 men, with over 500 miscellaneous rifles. Xu is a communist element who has been to Soviet Russia.

Xuan is a well-known communist element who once served as Sun Dianying's secretary-general and has long had communist connections, from whom he was expelled. (25th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) A spokesperson for the Army Ministry stated today that the Japanese garrison in North China and the Kwantung Army will severely deal with intrusions by the Chinese government army or irregular forces into the demilitarized zone stipulated in the Tanggu Agreement. According to news from Beiping, a Kwantung Army plane flew over Huairou and Shunyi on the 23rd to scout Fang's army's movements. Another report says that this morning at 10:00 AM, a plane flew low over Beiping for half an hour, dropping a large number of leaflets warning Fang Zhenwu's troops and others to withdraw from the demilitarized zone by midnight on September 26th, otherwise they will be dealt with by force.

<p>(Tianjin) According to reliable Chinese sources, the forces of Fang, Ji, and others, known as the Anti- [*text missing*] United Army (or Northeast United Army), are currently divided into five routes: (1) The first route, under the command of Ji Hongchang, has a strength of about 6,000 and is currently in Huairou. (2) The second route, under the command of Tang Yulin, has a strength of about 8,000 and is currently in Chicheng.

Therefore, the various armies have united and begun their offensive. The first phase of operations is to concentrate our forces in the area south of Shunyi and then attempt to capture Beiping. Our army's actions are a matter of life and death for the Republic of China. Therefore, I hope that you will adopt the spirit of friendly neighbors and take a bystander attitude, not interfering in our internal affairs. I deeply regret reading the telegram from the Japanese military commander on the 22nd, setting a deadline and demanding withdrawal. We have no choice but to temporarily station our troops here in preparation for war. I hope you will understand. Otherwise, it will not only be the misfortune of your country and your people.

Chinese sources also claim that although the Japanese army in Miyun has been reinforced, it is still watching Ji Hongchang's army occupy the two southwestern counties of Miyun and the surrounding areas.

<h3 id="e24">The US-Soviet Restoration of Diplomatic Relations and the Recent Trends in Soviet-Japanese Relations <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>The talk of the United States and the Soviet Union restoring normal diplomatic relations was already rampant during the Democratic and Republican election campaigns last year. The reason why it has not materialized is because of the United States' debt relationship with the Imperial Russian era and its reluctance to risk direct investment in the Soviet Union. However, since President Hoover announced the postponement of reparations and war debt payments in 1931, the global economy has shown no signs of recovery. The situation in Europe has only worsened. Germany is already unable to pay reparations, and Britain and France are on the verge of defaulting on their war debts to the United States. (Although Britain is currently making payments with difficulty, it has indicated that it will be difficult to continue in the future. France has already publicly stated that it will not pay.) As a result, the number of US capital frozen overseas is not comparable to the small amount of Imperial Russian loans and a few oil field stocks. Moreover, the Soviet Union only defaults on old debts, but has never broken its promise on new debts and has always been able to repay them on time. Therefore, American investors generally have a good impression of them. This is the first opportunity for the US and the Soviet Union to restore diplomatic relations, and it is also the key factor in the proposal to start a $50 million cotton and wheat loan between the two countries.</p>
<p>The United States and the Soviet Union have few absolute conflicts in economic terms. In the past four years, however, the capitalist economy has been in decline. Even the advanced countries in Europe are unable to pay their debts, so it can be imagined what the situation is in other countries. However, today's United States cannot help but open up overseas markets and develop overseas investment, rather than being confined to isolationism. Although the Soviet Union is a country that American banks are unwilling to deal with, it cannot but seek a way out overseas under these circumstances. Therefore, the commercial relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union has gradually moved from estranged to closer, and from closer to trying to restore diplomatic relations. The restoration of diplomatic relations between the United States and the Soviet Union is not only a trend that is inevitable in economic terms, but also in political terms the time will come when it matures. The competition on the Pacific Ocean and the capture of the Far Eastern market are the most watched problems in the world today. No matter how peaceful the United States is, it will not allow Japan to dominate alone, and it will not abandon its interests in the Far East. However, the United States has no real power to stop Japan's development. Even with a large navy, it is difficult to cross more than 5,000 miles and fight against Japan. In this serious and confrontational situation, the United States cannot but seek a powerful ally in the East for assistance, on the one hand to open up its economic difficulties, and on the other hand to try to escape its political dangers. There is no other way to find it except to restore diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>During this period, the Soviet Union is working hard to build its country and nurture the growth of its national power. Therefore, even if it has been repeatedly bullied to the extreme, it can only endure it temporarily and is unwilling to start a war lightly. However, its endurance has a certain limit. Since the Middle East Road problem occurred, the Soviet Union has repeatedly made concessions, while the Japanese army has strongly pressed forward. As a result, the verbal disputes and the ink-and-paper battles have come to an end. Yesterday, the Soviet government's newspaper "Izvestia" revealed the Japanese conspiracy on the Middle East Road issue. Its strong wording has surprised the world as never before. It can also be seen that the Soviet Union has reached a time when it can no longer endure it. In this context, the Soviet government will certainly be happy to accept the restoration of diplomatic relations between the United States and the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>What about Japan at this time? Since it withdrew from the League of Nations, its diplomacy has long been isolated and its economy has also gone to a dead end. It believes that the only way to save the situation is to make rapid military advances, so that the four northeastern provinces are completely under the control of the Japanese military forces. Then it will not be afraid of the United States and will have a strong basis against the Soviet Union. Therefore, on the one hand, it is trying to disturb our Guannei, and on the other hand, it is instigating the puppet of Manchukuo to quickly seize the Middle East Road. At the same time, it is expanding the propaganda that the Soviet Union is moving troops to defend the border in order to stimulate its hypnotized people. In addition to so-called strengthening military preparations, it is not hesitating to destroy the Washington Treaty and implement an increase of four divisions of regular troops. These four divisions will be permanently stationed in the territory of the three northeastern provinces, under the pretext of the so-called Japan-Manchukuo military business agreement. In reality, it is placing heavy troops on the border between the three northeastern provinces and the Soviet Union. What kind of scene will this trend lead to in the international community? How can our country not prepare in advance?</p>
<h3 id="e25">Bandits Enter Funing City, Changli Also Reports Crisis <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>Japanese Police Threaten County Magistrate to Hand Over</p>
<p>County Magistrate Liu Xingpei Retreats to Changli</p>
<p>Yin Tong's Negotiations with Chaishan Yield No Results</p>
<p>Changli: Since the self-defense team of Wucheng was reinforced on the 22nd, the bandits have slightly retreated. However, since the night, they have resumed their encirclement of Wucheng. On that night, a Japanese named Kunihiro Ryoichi, claiming to be a border police officer, entered the city, wanting to mediate and make peace between the two sides. County Magistrate Liu sternly refused, and Kunihiro left shamefully. The next day, the bandits turned to using heavy artillery to bombard the city. At that time, our police force was weak and reinforcements had not yet arrived, so the situation was extremely tense. Fortunately, one person was equal to a hundred, and they fought bravely. The day passed peacefully. Continuing, the bandit forces received a large number of supplies and launched a full-scale counterattack on the morning of the 24th. The situation worsened in the evening, and local traitors took the opportunity to become active, secretly electing the vile gentry Zu Guoqin as the temporary county magistrate, using the name of protecting the people. There was a lot of coercion. The fighting in the front was intense at night. Our police team, in order to echo the city, first deployed a unit of elite troops to defend Zijin Mountain, and the general headquarters temporarily ordered them to hold on to it. In the city, County Magistrate Liu, together with Public Security Bureau Chief Wu and the police team, strictly defended the area. However, at that time, the situation in the streets was already chaotic, and the people were extremely panicked. Refugees were fleeing westward one after another, and there was no way to stop them. The telegraph bureau then withdrew at 9:00 PM. County Magistrate Liu and the heads of the various bureaus withdrew at 10:00 PM. Before leaving, they communicated with Changli to explain the situation. They have now left Fu, and since then, communication has been cut off and the situation is unknown. That night, the weather was gloomy and the stars and moon were dark. The people of Fucheng, supporting the old and carrying the young, calling for their mothers and searching for their children, left Fu in an endless stream, reaching as many as 10,000 hungry people. After leaving the city, fearing that the bandits would know, they walked secretly in the dark. The road was rugged at night, and they stumbled one after another, daring not to hold fire. They rushed forward and jostled each other along the way. It is not known how many people were lost. They passed through Yanghe, wading through the water. The situation was tragic. On the morning of the 25th, they arrived in Changli, with muddy feet and dirty faces, weeping silently. At this time, County Magistrate Liu and the heads of the various bureaus had arrived in Changli. The police team in the front temporarily explained the situation because the county magistrate had left the city. They had no choice but to obey the order to transfer defenses and leave Fucheng. Chang County heard the news in the morning and the whole city was in an uproar. At the same time, the local defense groups guarded the city gates, and refugees carrying large amounts of goods were not allowed to enter the city. The situation became increasingly tense, and panic arose in the streets. Shops resumed transporting goods westward, and schools were all closed. County Magistrate Liang then temporarily convened a meeting of local gentry to discuss ways to defend the city, but there were no concrete results. The Chamber of Commerce then continued to meet. At 10:00 AM, an employee of the Emergency Relief Association suddenly came from Fu to Chang to report that as of 6:00 AM, the bandits had not yet entered the city, and other situations were unknown. Subsequently, the reports received one after another all stated that the bandits had not entered the city. In the afternoon, at 5:00 PM, Liu planned to lead his troops east because the situation in the front was very tense, but it did not happen for some reason. In the evening, a confirmed report was received that the bandits had entered the city on the morning of the 24th at 9:00 AM. They fired at the city once before entering, knowing that there were no police in the city. Moreover, the city sent people to welcome them, so they entered the city openly. After entering the city, they robbed and looted on a large scale. Chang City was on strict guard at night, and there was no one in the streets. At 10:00 PM, a report was received that the bandits were only twenty miles away from the city. Funing County Magistrate Liu and the heads of the various bureaus returned to Tianjin to report everything to the provincial authorities. Changli is in a state of tension. (25th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) At noon on the 24th, when bandits rushed into Funing City and were engaged in fierce fighting with the security team, suddenly, the Japanese police captain, Kunihiro Ryoichi, led more than ten Japanese policemen into the city. The bandits then stopped their attack and suddenly summoned traitors to form an autonomous association, and threatened the county magistrate to handle the handover. The security of the city would be maintained by the association. County Magistrate Liu Xingpei then fled to Changli with the Public Security Bureau Chief. For several days, more than 10,000 refugees have fled from Fu, looking disheveled and miserable. The situation is extremely tragic. Yin Tong has already seriously negotiated with Chaishan in Beiping, but nothing has been heard of the result. Yin also sent representative Su Yuqi to Tianjin at 7:00 PM to report to Yu on the progress of the negotiations. (25th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Beiping) A reporter met with Ying Bingxun on the 25th. According to him, the central government previously considered the situation in Chahar unstable and no one was taking responsibility. Therefore, he was appointed as the Commander of Bandit Suppression in Chahar Province. Now that the Chahar situation has been resolved and someone is taking responsibility, he has already declined the post of Commander of Bandit Suppression in Chahar Province to Chairman He. Chairman He still insisted that he reluctantly take on the task because the Chahar situation has not yet been consolidated. However, he believes that bandit suppression is a soldier's duty, and he should work hard even without a title, without wasting national money by giving another title. He is still firmly declining to accept. His army is actively training and implementing downsizing in accordance with the central government's established organizational methods. (Central News Agency dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Hebei Provincial Party Headquarters held a memorial week at 10:00 AM on the 25th. Central Committee member Zhang Lisheng, 40th Army Commander Pang Bingxun, and more than 60 other provincial party committee staff members attended. Pang Bingxun gave a speech, saying that during the recent Great Wall Resistance, people generally believed that weapons were inferior to those of the enemy. However, the root cause was the lack of principles. The Party advocates governing the army with the Party's principles. If this principle can be implemented, there will be no easy defeats. Before the Meiji Restoration, the corruption of Japanese soldiers was no less than that of Chinese soldiers. However, after the Meiji Restoration, Japanese soldiers had principles, which led to today's achievements. Currently, many of our country's troops are privately owned. How can they defend the country and save the people? If the army lacks principles, even with good equipment, the result will still be failure. Therefore, only by implementing governing the army with the Party's principles can we become strong. He hopes that comrades will work hard at the grassroots level in the army.

<p>Illegal Arrest of Russian Personnel Russia Issues Strong Protest to Japan</p>

<p>(Tokyo) According to a telegram from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Sokolnikov invited Ambassador Ota to the ministry on the 21st and delivered the following protest: "[Manchukuo]" is attempting to reduce the powers of the Director-General under the pretext of reforming the Chinese Eastern Railway. This violates the 1924 agreement. Furthermore, it is reported that "[Manchukuo]" officials are plotting to arrest Soviet employees of the Northern Railway, which infringes upon Soviet interests. The Soviet government believes that the aforementioned illegal actions of "[Manchukuo]" are instigated by the Japanese government and therefore protests to the Tokyo government. Ambassador Ota immediately retorted that "[Manchukuo]" is an independent state, and the Japanese government cannot interfere in the actions of "[Manchukuo]". Therefore, the Soviet protest is completely misdirected, and Japan has no reason to accept such a protest. In particular, the issue of the Director-General's powers is a long-standing issue, and it is believed that the reform of the Northern Railway does not violate the 1924 agreement. As for the arrest of Soviet employees, it is an exercise of "[Manchukuo]'s" judicial power and not Japan's responsibility. (Dentsu dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(Harbin) Regarding the alleged incident involving four Russian employees of the Chinese Eastern Railway, Consul-General Vlasov visited Shi Fuben, the Special Envoy for Foreign Affairs of "[Manchukuo]," at 2:00 PM yesterday and lodged a strong protest, saying that the arrest of the Russian employees was an illegal detention and demanding their immediate release. Shi replied that it was not an illegal detention, rejected the Soviet protest, and decided to ignore it. (Dentsu dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(Harbin) The investigation into the "[irregular]" incident of Russian cadres of the Chinese Eastern Railway has been expanded.

(Dentsu dispatch, 29th)</p>
<p>(London) The detention of four important Russian employees of the Chinese Eastern Railway by "[Manchukuo]" and the strong protest from Moscow have drawn the attention of the British public back to the tense situation in the Far East. For example, the Daily Telegraph published an editorial considering the possibility of conflict in the Far East, stating that "[Soviet Russia has used all its diplomatic efforts to resemble European countries. Now, the western border of Soviet Russia, from Europe to Central Asia, has security guarantees. ] Therefore, it has freedom of action in the Far East." However, the newspaper believes that conflicts are unlikely to occur in the near future. The conclusion is that "[Military action in Siberia is impossible during the winter months, but the tension of the situation does not therefore ease. Soviet newspapers are almost openly threatening Japan, which is difficult for the Japanese to endure given their current state of mind. Therefore, it is inevitable that the situation will become more serious." Similarly, the Socialist Daily Herald published an article by the party's economist, Williams, stating that Japan is spending vast sums of money on military actions and preparing for war, and its economy and finance are on the verge of bankruptcy. He also stated that Japanese Finance Minister Takahashi's recent advice to the military to save national funds has been ineffective. Japan will fully utilize the planned devaluation of the yen as a way to save itself, but its dumping of goods to various countries will inevitably lead to retaliatory measures, and Japan may be affected. Williams concluded that the Japanese budget deficit for 1934 will reach as much as 10 billion yen. (Havas dispatch, 25th)</p>

The total strength of the Russian forces currently gathered in the Far East is about 140,000, many of which are newly equipped units, and the number of aircraft has reached 300. However, according to recent intelligence received by the Japanese military, the Russian troop movements to the Far East seem to have come to an end. Although the Russian side admits to the movement of some of the newest equipment units to the Far East, it explains that the movement of other units is related to training and has no other meaning. It is rumored that the Russian government intends to move troops westward again due to the recent tense political atmosphere in Germany. (Japan Allied News dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to a statement from the Japanese military, Russia has mobilized 140,000 troops and 300 aircraft, all equipped with the latest weapons, and mostly mechanized units.

<p>(Tokyo) What kind of tariff policy Japan will implement in the midst of the fierce tariff wars among countries around the world is attracting the most attention. The Ministry of Finance previously planned to add 35% to the specific duties that are being studied in order to balance the ad valorem taxes. The future trade policy will be to conduct individual reciprocal trade with various countries, without changing the overall tariff rates for the time being. According to a conversation with Finance Minister Takahashi, Japan is accumulating and promoting sales channels, so it should conclude commercial treaties with counterpart countries separately, and change tariff rates for the types of goods that should be imported at any time. There is currently no intention to change the overall tariff. (Japan Allied News dispatch, 25th)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) The British-Indian-Japanese trade conference in Shimla opened at 10:00 AM this morning. All Indian representatives attended except for the Trade Commissioner, Poorian, who was ill. Only the opening ceremony was held today. The meeting is scheduled to reconvene on the 27th. It is said that the new Foreign Minister, Hirota, attaches great importance to this conference. He not only plans to start overall diplomatic negotiations with Britain from an economic standpoint, but also from a political standpoint, urging the Trade Bureau to study countermeasures. It is said that the following policy has been decided: (1) The Indian government's cancellation of the India-Japan trade treaty, although said to be for the purpose of protecting domestic products, is actually manipulated by Britain in the middle, and the intention is to protect British industries, which is not based on India's own economic reasons. For example, if India does not produce rayon, Britain will still make the rayon issue an important issue for discussion. Japan will never discuss this issue. (2) If Britain and India only acknowledge the cancellation of the current treaty and are unwilling to enter into a new treaty, Japan is willing to treat them as countries without treaties and will never give in. (3) Japan wants to insist on the principle of the most-favored-nation clause. (4) If Britain does not reflect on its policy towards the Far East, Japan will give up its cooperation stemming from the Anglo-Japanese alliance and take necessary actions.

<p>(Geneva) The 14th Ordinary Session of the League of Nations Assembly opened today, hoping to steer the League of Nations, which suffered three major failures last year – the Sino-Japanese dispute, the disarmament conference, and the economic conference – safely through the reefs of the stormy seas. The representatives gathering here today all acknowledge that the League of Nations, which has existed for thirteen years, is now going through a seriously dangerous period. Its future authority and dignity depend entirely on whether the member states can reaffirm their commitment to fulfilling their obligations under the Covenant in the coming weeks, or whether they will sink and break on the rocks of international suspicion.

<p>(Geneva) The 14th session of the League of Nations Assembly opened this morning. The number of attendees is not as large as in previous years. Among the representatives are German Propaganda Minister Goebbels and Austrian Chancellor Dollfuss. Czech Foreign Minister Benes, Yugoslav Foreign Minister Yevtich, and Romanian Foreign Minister Titulescu are holding a meeting of the Little Entente countries in Silesia, Romania, and were unable to attend the League of Nations Assembly. In the French delegation's seating area are Foreign Minister Pongou, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee Bérenger, and Hubert Delbos. (Havas dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e45">Opening Speech <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>(Geneva) Norwegian Prime Minister Mowinckel, Chairman of the League of Nations Council, made a clear and straightforward statement on the World Economic Conference and the Disarmament Conference at the opening of the Assembly today, saying that both conferences were comparative failures. The reasons for this may be explained: it is difficult to gather many countries and have them unanimously agree and reach an agreement. A new dawn may be discovered, and a solid foundation for resolution may be found, but in reality, the results have not yet been achieved. The reason for this is that a basis for cooperation between countries with strong forces has not been established beforehand. If such powerful countries do not agree, satisfactory results cannot be obtained, as evidenced by the dispute over stabilizing currency prices at the Economic Conference. This statement can also be applied to the Disarmament Conference. The failure of the Disarmament Conference has led to the question of whether the League of Nations' prestige is more harmed than benefited if the Disarmament Conference ends abruptly without achieving anything.</p>
<p>Referring to the Far East, the Chairman also spoke of the dispute in the Far East, saying that although the League of Nations has made sincere efforts many times, it has ultimately failed to create a better situation. This fact has certainly not solidified the League of Nations' position in the eyes of the world, and will evoke feelings even worse than those produced by the situation in Europe. Fifteen years after the war, we feel that the progress towards seeking better understanding, a clearer atmosphere, and a more stable mentality among the peoples of all countries is still extremely small. This is our shame. Not only is progress extremely slow, but the idea of the possibility of war often lingers in our minds, permeating all countries, and is regarded as a major future problem. The League of Nations was once a group in which the world placed great hope. Now, the world blames the League of Nations, which is not only inevitable, but also reasonable. (Reuters dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>Election of Chairman The Assembly then elected a chairman. The result of the vote was unexpected. South African representative Walter won with 30 votes out of 53, while the previously expected Mexican representative Najera received only 20 votes. It is now known that the British overseas territories and the Scandinavian countries began to campaign for the South African representative at the last minute, resulting in the above results. Walter has repeatedly given speeches in recent months attacking Japan's interference in Northeast affairs, which has made him famous. After Mr. Walter was elected, he took the chairmanship seat and thanked the representatives of all countries, declaring that he would treat everyone with fairness.</p>
<p>Adoption of the Agenda The Assembly then adjourned briefly and reconvened, adopting the agenda and deciding to establish five committees, which were instructed to meet separately in the afternoon and elect their respective chairmen. The Assembly itself is scheduled to reconvene at 5:30 PM to elect vice-chairmen. (Havas dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e46">Seating Arrangement <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>(Geneva) The seating arrangement of each representative in the venue is arranged according to the French alphabet. Therefore, the representatives of the German and Austrian governments, who are currently in opposite positions, happen to be seated side by side in the first row. German Chief Representative Goebbels did not arrive until the last minute before the meeting began. Six men in plain clothes were guarding him. German journalists and onlookers welcomed him and gave the Fascist salute.</p>
<p>Reconvenes in the Afternoon After electing the chairman at this morning's meeting, the meeting adjourned at 1:20 PM and will reconvene at 5:00 PM this afternoon. It is expected that non-permanent directors will be elected at that time to replace Ireland, Guatemala, and Norway, whose terms have expired. (National News Agency dispatch) Behind-the-Scenes Negotiations The agenda of this session of the Assembly is unusually bland, with no major issues. The general debate of the representatives in the first week will likely reiterate dissatisfaction with last year's achievements and suggest ways to save the League of Nations from destruction. The most important developments during the session often do not occur in the Assembly hall, but in the lounges and hotels, where the representatives often make startling proposals during private discussions on the League of Nations and major European issues. (National News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>The Jewish Question Given today's situation, it seems that the German treatment of the Jewish people will cause fierce debate in the Assembly. The Czech Republic and Poland attempted this spring to force the League of Nations Assembly to discuss the universal application of minority treaties, so that German Jews would receive the same treatment as Aryan Germans. Now, Jews everywhere have petitioned the League of Nations to intervene in Germany's rejection of Jews. If legal persons from countries allied with the League want to add fuel to the fire, it can turn into an extremely fierce debate. However, given the current situation in the Assembly, it seems that only this matter is enough to make the atmosphere tense. (National News Agency dispatch)</p>

<p>(Geneva) Today at 5 PM, German Minister of Propaganda, Mr. Joseph Goebbels, arrived here by plane from Frankfurt on the Main River. Among those welcoming him at the airfield were the German Permanent Deputy Secretary to the League of Nations, the German Consul in Geneva, the representative of the German National Socialist Party in Switzerland, and several German journalists. Afterward, Goebbels accompanied German Foreign Minister Neurath to the Carlton Hotel. It is said that the two gentlemen, Goebbels and Neurath, will reside here for an extended period during the disarmament conference. (National Telegram, 24th)</p>
<p>(Paris) French Foreign Minister Paul-Boncour and the American Special Representative, Mr. Davis, departed for Geneva last night. According to newspapers, French Premier Daladier may also personally go to Geneva. Furthermore, according to a report from the Geneva "Volksbund," Germany is prepared to conduct extensive propaganda in Geneva. Therefore, French public opinion believes that France should immediately launch an attack on Germany's disarmament plan. (National Telegram, 24th)</p>

<p>(Geneva) This afternoon, British Foreign Secretary Sir John Simon and American Representative Davis played golf together as recreation. Afterward, the two continued to discuss political affairs for a long time. Italian Undersecretary of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Suvich, arrived here this afternoon, which was unexpected. This also demonstrates that the Italian Prime Minister places great hope in the reopening of this disarmament conference. Mr. Suvich's presence in Geneva will place him in the intermediary position between the Italian Prime Minister and the Italian chief representative. The Italian chief representative, Baron Aloisi, is too busy with his duties in Geneva to return to Italy frequently to report everything. Mr. Suvich will travel between Rome and Geneva, conveying and communicating opinions between the two parties. This evening, Sir John Simon met with Austrian Chancellor Dollfuss, discussing matters related to Austria's domestic politics and the Austrian loan. (National Telegram, 24th)</p>

<p>(Washington) A US government official stated today that communists trained in Moscow have established communist organizations throughout Cuba. Reports of armed communists in several locations in Cuba confiscating food without compensation are increasing anxiety in Washington political circles. There are increasing concerns that the unrest will intensify, making it necessary for the United States to send troops to land. Commanders of US warships stationed off the coast of Cuba have received instructions to deploy sailors ashore if necessary. At the same time, in diplomatic circles, it is believed that US intervention may hinder the success of the Pan-American Conference. This conference will be held in December in the capital of Uruguay. It is reported that President Roosevelt hopes to establish a closer diplomatic and commercial relationship between the United States and the Latin American republics at this conference to compensate for the United States' loss of trade with Europe. Diplomatic circles also believe that Japan will compare the United States' intervention in Cuba to Japan's invasion of Manchuria. Regarding the situation in Cuba, it is important to note that the Platt Amendment, which states [the United States should return the governing power of the island of Cuba to its people], also includes the following provisions: (1) Cuba shall never enter into any treaty that could impair its independence or allow any foreign power to station troops there. (2) Public debt should be limited to regular income. (3) Cuba shall permit the United States to intervene to preserve Cuba's independence and maintain a government sufficient to protect life, property, and individual liberty, and to fulfill the obligations of the Cuban government under the Treaty of Paris. (4) All actions taken during the US military occupation shall be deemed valid, and the rights obtained thereby shall be recognized. (5) Sanitation plans for Cuba's cities must be implemented to prevent the recurrence of epidemics and protect commerce. (6) The Isle of Pines is not within the territory of the Cuban Constitution. Ownership of the Isle of Pines will be determined by treaty in the future. (7) To enable the United States to maintain Cuba's independence, land needed for establishing naval stations may be sold or leased, as agreed upon with the Cuban President. (8) The above clauses must be included in the treaties concluded between Cuba and the United States. (Reuters Telegram, 24th)</p>

<p>Archduke Otto Openly Demands the Throne and Vigorously Attacks National Socialism</p>
<p>Vienna Archduke Otto, son of the late Austrian Emperor Charles, publicly demanded the throne today while accepting honorary citizenship from three Austrian cities, indicating that the Austrian monarchist movement has openly commenced. The three cities are Hainfeld, Mürzzuschlag, and Judenburg, and their county executives presented the honorary citizenship to the Archduke here today. The Archduke, who is currently nineteen years old and residing in Switzerland, sent a representative to accept the honor, accompanied by a handwritten letter guaranteeing that with God's blessing, the time for him to lead Austria again is not far off. He believes that the laws restricting the activities of the Habsburg royal family will soon be repealed. Without these unfair laws, he will occupy the position that the people desire and that his duty requires. Finally, he declared that the methods of National Socialism are not suitable for Austria and that accepting them blindly would be tantamount to treason. Since Dollfuss formed the new cabinet last week, monarchists in Austria have been celebrating, believing that the time for restoration is drawing near, and the possibility of restoration is now being openly discussed by the people.

<h3 id="e52">White House Financial Conference <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>Government Plans to Exert All Efforts to Release Frozen Loans, Large-Scale Encouragement Campaign to Begin Next Month</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 25th The White House held an important conference last night to discuss financial matters. Afterward, the President's Secretary stated that the purpose of the meeting was to study the current financial situation, with particular attention to making credit available to industry and commerce, but there was no intention to immediately adopt new inflationary measures. It is generally believed that this statement indicates that, in any event, there will likely be no direct currency inflation measures taken in the near future, and it indicates that the government will make every effort to circulate the stagnant deposits of closed or restricted banks. It is reported that the discussion at the meeting focused on the difficult problem of releasing these stagnant deposits. Secretary of Agriculture Wallace stated today that if Americans do not want to adopt a world trade policy suitable for creditors, then the United States must eliminate the production of 400,000 acres of excess farmland that were cultivated before the war. He believes that managing production is essential.</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 25th General Johnson, the administrator of the Recovery Act, plans to launch a large-scale campaign on October 1st to encourage people to buy promptly in order to stimulate the circulation of money. The government's new plan seeks to coordinate the efforts of four government agencies to release stagnant deposits and place banks on a sound footing. The Financial Rehabilitation Society will purchase preferred securities to activate bank capital. The Agricultural Loan Bureau and the Domestic Loan Office will repay mortgage assets with immediately saleable bonds (in effect, guaranteeing mortgages). The Mortgage Guarantee Society will guarantee the deposits of new depositors.</p>

<p>National, Hanover, 24th This morning, the German Steel Helmet League held its annual meeting here. More than 50,000 participants, wearing gray uniforms and swastika armbands, mostly veterans of the European War, were reviewed by Chancellor Hitler and the league's commander, Labor Minister Seldte. This review is sufficient to indicate the close integration of the Steel Helmet League and the National Socialist Party, and the Steel Helmet League's loyalty to its leader and to Hitler. The past grudges between veterans and the National Socialist Party can therefore be eliminated.</p>

<p>National, Turin, 25th The shroud in which Jesus's body was wrapped after being taken down from the cross, known as the Holy Shroud by Christians, is the most precious relic in the religion. After being transported from the East to Europe, it was treasured by the royal families of France and Austria. Two hundred years ago, it came into the hands of the Italian House of Savoy, where it has been carefully stored in the cathedral here. A separate chapel has been built to house it. After the Italian princess married the Belgian prince in 1930, it was opened for viewing once. This year marks the 1,900th anniversary of Jesus's ascension, and it was opened for public viewing starting today, scheduled to last until October 15th. When the public viewing ceremony was held today, all the princes and princesses of the House of Savoy currently residing in Italy personally attended the church. All the civil and military officials of the city participated devoutly. The grandeur and solemnity of the ceremony were unparalleled.</p>

<p>Li Yuying: Reviving Agriculture; Sun Ke: The Principle of People's Livelihood</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central Government held its 97th Memorial Week at 8 AM on the 25th. Attendees included Central Committee members Li Ciwen, Li Yuying, Chu Minyi, Wang Qi, Zheng Zhan'nan, Xiao Zhongzhen, Chen Lifu, Li Jingzhai, Li Zonghuang, Miao Peicheng, Ma Chaojun, and all staff members, totaling 500 people. Chu Minyi chaired the meeting, and Li Yuying gave a report, stating that China is an agricultural country, so agricultural issues are very important. The Premier's teachings are full of instructions on revitalizing agriculture and reviving rural areas. At present, rural areas are already bankrupt, and solving this problem is the top priority. Recently, the people of the country have also paid attention to this, and there have been designs, research associations, or discussion groups on reviving rural areas, or the establishment of various experimental villages. There are already more than 30 such places across the country. Regarding rural relief, it should involve projects such as water conservancy, land reclamation, and industry. To make rural areas sound, it should involve rural autonomy, self-defense, education, and economics. This year, when Mr. Zhang Jingjiang and I attended the Zouping Rural Discussion Conference, we carefully studied the issue and felt that increasing agricultural production is the foundation of rural relief. If production is not increased, and only the education and living standards of farmers are raised, their desires will increase, their production power will decrease, and farmers will have a tendency to take off their short shirts and put on long shirts. Therefore, my conclusions are: (1) Follow the Premier's teachings and focus on agriculture. (2) Reviving rural areas should start with increasing agricultural production. (3) Focus on practical work and do not engage in empty talk. The meeting adjourned at 9 AM. (Central News Agency Telegram, 25th)</p>

Chairman Lin led the ceremony, and Sun Ke reported on the importance of the Principle of People's Livelihood, stating that as the arrogance of the Red Bandits increases daily, it is even more evident how important the Principle of People's Livelihood, created by the Premier, is. The most important thing is to start with a controlled economy to achieve the goals of regulating capital and equalizing land ownership. If the problem of people's livelihood is solved, then the Red Bandits will collapse on their own. (Central News Agency Telegram, 25th)</p>

<p>Oppose He Zhizhong's Request to Claim Relief Funds</p>
<p>(Nanjing) You Guocai and others from Guizhou telegraphed the Central Government, stating that the autumn harvest last year was poor, and there were floods in the spring and summer, urgently requiring relief. The reason why the disaster situation in Guizhou is so severe is partly due to the turmoil in Guizhou, which has not yet subsided, and partly due to the provincial government forcing the issuance of 2 million yuan of irredeemable paper money and various kinds of harsh levies. Now, Division Commander He Zhizhong has been sent to Beijing on behalf of the province to request relief funds. If this were truly for the sake of the people, it would be what the people of Guizhou longingly pray for. However, after He Zhizhong went to Beijing, he whitewashed the aftermath and deceived the Central Government. The province is also trying to fabricate reasons to swindle 5 million yuan of cotton and wheat funds to pay for a large batch of weapons and ammunition ordered in Hong Kong. The people of Guizhou have already telegraphed to expose their falsehoods. Now it is heard that they are requesting relief funds, and it is inevitable that they will be diverted to military expenses, increasing the disasters in Guizhou. You Guocai and others, whose hunger and suffering have not been alleviated, feel deeply responsible and dare to present the facts, requesting that the relief funds allocated to Guizhou be directly sent to the affected areas by personnel, so as to prevent the people from receiving the empty name of relief but suffering the disasters of war.

<p>(Fuzhou) The remaining bandits in northern Fujian have been severely attacked by our forces in recent days and have been greatly defeated. Knowing that they could not succeed due to the pursuit by our army, they gathered the bandits from Yangkou on the evening of the 21st and launched a fierce attack on the Tang regiment in Shunchang. After a night of fierce fighting, the bandits suffered more than a thousand casualties. The next morning, due to the fierce bombardment of our artillery and machine guns, the bandits dug tunnels to try to sneak into the city and cause trouble. Our troops had prepared an ambush in advance and launched a surprise attack in the tunnels, annihilating all more than 400 remaining bandits who had sneaked into the tunnels, and capturing more than 400 rifles. Previously, the bandits failed to attack Yanping and changed to attacking Shunchang, where we killed more than a thousand bandits and captured more than ten heavy and light machine guns and more than 300 pistols and rifles. The bandits suffered heavy losses, and after the failure to attack Yanping, infighting broke out, and more than a thousand people dispersed. Many also surrendered to us. After suffering this setback, the bandits were terrified and completely routed. (Central News Agency Telegram, 24th)</p>

Mao Zedong also held a meeting in Yangkou, eyeing the provincial capital. The 19th Route Army's troop strength is insufficient to be allocated. Suppressing the communists lies in surrounding them on all sides so that they will defeat themselves. If they are allowed to gain power in Fujian and satisfy their desires, what will become of the overall situation? Please quickly send capable troops to encircle and suppress them from the Zhejiang-Jiangxi border day and night, and order the Chaozhou-Meizhou-Guangdong armies to advance to western Fujian to assist in the encirclement and suppression. Also, the Fujian Provincial Party Department repeatedly telegraphed Beijing and Lushan, stating that Nanping and Jian'ou are in extremely critical situations. The Beijing Fellow Townsmen Association replied that it had telegraphed Chairman Jiang in Lushan and Commander-in-Chief Chen in Guangdong, requesting them to quickly dispatch capable troops to rush to the rescue and encircle and suppress the bandits. It also telegraphed Chen Jitang in Guangdong, stating that Fujian's troop strength is limited, and the provincial capital is in imminent danger. If Fujian is not protected, Guangdong will also be unsafe. Please join forces to encircle and suppress the bandits, so that the 30 million people of northern Fujian can all benefit from your great virtue. It also telegraphed Jiang Guangnai, stating that the red bandits are rampant, and the disaster-stricken people of northern Fujian are crowded in the provincial capital, requesting that you find a way to accommodate and provide relief.

<p>Collected Land Tax Surcharges in Installments and Averaged</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Finance, in order to consolidate land tax surcharges, consulted with various ministries and commissions to formulate measures, which were submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval and circulated for compliance. Currently, the amount of land tax surcharges collected in each installment in various localities is inconsistent. Generally, the amount of surcharges in the first installment is much higher than in other installments. Even most of the surcharges are collected under the first installment of land tax. At that time, farmers have no large-scale harvest, and ordering them to pay huge amounts of taxes is not in line with the principle of measuring taxpaying ability when collecting taxes. Moreover, farmers' capital is attached to the harvest. In the past, when farmers were farming and irrigating, they urgently needed funds, and collecting more than half of the annual land tax surcharge caused a shortage of funds for production, which had a significant impact on agricultural production and farmers' economy. It is a universally recognized principle that taxes should be collected at the most convenient time. Now, collecting huge amounts of taxes during the busy farming season is completely contrary to this principle. At a time when the rural economy is on the verge of bankruptcy, and the central and local governments are jointly seeking relief, land tax surcharges should be corrected as soon as possible and collected in installments within the prescribed limits. If the land tax was originally collected in two installments, each installment should collect half of the surcharges. If it was previously collected in three installments, each installment should collect one-third of the surcharges. The timing of collection should not violate agriculture. This is a point that requires special attention in consolidating land tax surcharges, and it is also closely related to rural revitalization. Yesterday, a special instruction was given to the finance departments and bureaus of each province and city to instruct the counties to comply and report the handling situation to the ministry for inspection.

According to Chen Yansheng, a confidant of Chen, the Five-Colored Flag was the national flag that Chen had supported throughout his life, and the flags on both sides are the flags of the Zhi Gong Party. The "well" character represents "farmers owning their land." Chen was the leader of the Zhi Gong Party, so the party flag should be hung after his death to show respect. The blue cloth on the coffin is a sign of anti-filial piety because Chen still has a 13-year-old mother. In short, the layout of the spiritual hall is strange and colorful, and indescribable.

<p>Japanese Troops Planned to Invade Beiping, Japanese Military Planned to Send Eighth Division to Drive Out Fang's Troops</p>
<p>Our Side Refused Japanese Troops to Enter War Zone, Japanese Planes Flew Over Ping, Dispersing Warning Leaflets</p>
<p>Beiping Special Dispatch, Fang Zhenwu's troops suddenly entered the war zone of Huairou County from the Chahar-Rehe border on the 20th, a bolt from the blue, shocking all parties. The authorities have been negotiating with the Japanese side to find a solution to prevent future troubles. The Kwantung Army Headquarters issued a warning, limiting Fang's troops to completely withdraw from the war zone by the 26th. Details are recorded below:</p>
<h3 id="e94">Fang's Troops Fled into War Zone <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>Fang Zhenwu, after meeting in Dushikou with representatives of Ji Hongchang, Zheng Guilin, and Tang Yulin, Liu Guitang, Li Shouxin, etc., decided to change their flags and jointly organize, left Dushikou and fled east, detouring through the Fengning County territory on the Rehe border, and entered the war zone, invading the Great Wall through Changyuankou. On the morning of the 20th, the vanguard of four to five hundred cavalry arrived in Huairou County. The security team in the city only had one hundred and twenty people, with weak strength. Furthermore, they had only recently arrived in Huairou to garrison, and the people's hearts were not attached. Fang's troops went straight to the city, the security team closed the city gate, preparing to defend. Local gentry and merchants, fearing that the area would be devastated if Fang's troops attacked if the city was not opened, asked the county magistrate Xu Wenquan and the security team leader to open the city to welcome the enemy. Fang's troops then occupied the county seat.</p>

<p>After Fang's troops' vanguard cavalry entered the city, the remaining troops arrived one after another. Fang himself also entered the city on the 21st, setting up a headquarters in a certain prison shop in the city, with the banner "Punish XX Allied Army". Fang's troops who arrived in Huairou include one guard battalion with more than one hundred and fifty men, one cavalry division with more than eight hundred men, and three infantry brigades with more than one thousand two hundred men. In addition, there are attached training corps. Although the organization is extremely large, there are only two thousand people. Less than two-thirds of the troops have firearms, and most of them are pistols. The strength is extremely weak. The guard battalion is currently stationed in the city, and the cavalry and training corps are stationed in Jiao Xiaocun. The infantry is stationed in Diaoyutai and Shichang villages. There are about six to seven hundred plainclothes soldiers inside and outside Huairou City. When Fang's troops first entered the city, they set up outposts to defend and cut off traffic, allowing people to leave but not enter. From Huairou to the south, sentries were placed in Qiaozicun and Nanshicao in the sixth district of Shunyi County, extorting supplies and cash from merchants and residents. A support bureau was established in the city to handle military affairs. Slogans were posted all over the streets and important places, mostly with the meaning of defending the local area and resisting the central government. After arriving in Huairou on the 21st, Fang convened a military-civilian conference. Fang and his entourage all gave speeches in public and distributed many leaflets. After the military-civilian conference, military conferences were held continuously to discuss the plan to flee and disturb the area. According to reports, their first step was to invade Beiping. Fang's troops would go south from Huairou, and Ji Hongchang, Liu Guitang, Tang Yulin, and Zheng Guilin's troops would go south from the Nankou area. The second step, if the attack on Beiping failed, would be to turn to Luandong and join forces with the bandits in Luandong to make a major move. After deliberation, it was decided that after Ji, Liu, Tang, Zheng, and other troops arrived, they would begin their first step of the plan. At the same time, they would also establish contact with Luandong.</p>

<p>On the 21st, two Japanese military vehicles carrying forty to fifty Japanese soldiers and three or four officers, carrying two machine guns, arrived at the east gate of Huairou from Miyun and spread out, preparing to shoot. Then, one Japanese officer entered the city and went straight to Fang's headquarters, holding talks with Fang's troops for a long time. The content is unknown. After the talks, Fang sent personnel to escort him out of the city, and he led the soldiers back north in the original military vehicles. At the same time, a Japanese plane came to Huairou and Shunyi to scout. After our side made representations, the Japanese side issued a warning to Fang's troops, limiting them to withdraw from the war zone by the 26th. In the past few days, Fang's troops have been extensively extorting from merchants and residents in Huairou. The supplies and other items obtained have been loaded onto large carts and moved outside the city, appearing to be fleeing elsewhere. It is said that Fang, with limited strength, does not dare to flee south and may flee to Luandong to join the bandits and seek a major move.</p>
<h3 id="e97">Authorities' Countermeasures <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>After receiving the report that Fang's troops had fled into the war zone, the authorities immediately convened military, political, and diplomatic officials to study countermeasures. All agreed that Huairou is close to Beiping and is located in the war zone. Sending troops to suppress them would require the consent of the Japanese side. After discussion, it was decided: (1) According to the agreement made at the time of the ceasefire agreement, our side could send troops to the war zone to suppress bandits when necessary with the understanding of the Japanese side, make representations to the Japanese side and seek the consent of the Japanese side to send troops to suppress them in order to avoid future troubles. (2) Because Huairou is close to Beiping and Changping and other places, make necessary arrangements at the connection points to prevent Fang's troops from fleeing and disturbing the area.</p>
<h3 id="e98">Situation of Negotiations with Japan <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>After the authorities decided on the countermeasures, they made the necessary arrangements while sending Yin Tong and Liu Shisun to negotiate with the Japanese side. Yin and others visited military attache Chiba at the Japanese embassy on the previous day (21st), explaining our side's intentions and seeking the Japanese side's consent for our side to send troops to suppress them to avoid future troubles. Chiba telegraphed the Kwantung Army to ask for instructions. Yesterday (22nd) at 5:00 PM, Chiba visited He Yingqin at Jurentang, saying that he had received a reply from the Kwantung Army. In order to maintain the spirit of the ceasefire agreement, it was decided to issue a serious warning to Fang Zhenwu, limiting him to withdraw from the war zone by the 26th, otherwise drastic measures would be taken. He also declared that the Kwantung Army believed that Fang's troops had communist elements and planned to send a part of the Eighth Division into the Great Wall to suppress Fang's troops. The reason he gave was that the Japanese army had new-style weapons such as airplanes and tanks, which would facilitate the rapid elimination of Fang's troops. The authorities, considering that the war zone is our country's territory, and suppressing Fang's troops did not require the Japanese side to act on their behalf, rejected it based on the agreement and put forward three reasons: (1) If the Japanese army that had already withdrawn according to the agreement were to re-enter the war zone, countries around the world would definitely become suspicious of Japan, and it would also increase the difficulties for both sides when Japanese soldiers later returned. (2) If the Japanese army entered the war zone to drive out Fang's troops in order to quickly suppress them, using airplanes to bomb and artillery to bombard, the innocent people in the war-torn Huairou area would inevitably be affected, which would not be conducive to taking care of the local area. (3) Fang's troops are weak and will not flee south. If they are helpless, they will inevitably flee to various parts of the war zone. If the Japanese army tracks and pursues them, the entire war zone will inevitably be devastated. It is hoped that the Japanese side will follow the spirit of the agreement and let our side send troops to suppress them alone. Chiba promised to consider it and telegraphed Tokyo and Changchun for instructions. Our side is currently waiting for the Japanese side to reply before determining the policy.</p>
<h3 id="e99">Japanese Planes Suddenly Fly Over Ping <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>While negotiations between our side and the Japanese army to resolve the Fang troops had not yet been settled, Japanese planes suddenly flew over Ping and distributed police leaflets. This morning (23rd), a Japanese plane took off from Miyun and flew south along Huairou, Niulanshan, Shunyi, and Gaoliying to Ping. At 10:20 AM, it was discovered over Andingmen and flew south along Dongsi Pailou, distributing leaflets along the way. The flight was extremely low, and the sound shook the roofs, causing panic among the citizens. When it flew to the Japanese barracks in Dongjiaomin Lane, it dropped a communication tube and circled once over the city of Ping before flying north. The original text of the leaflet that was distributed is recorded below: "Warning to Fang Zhenwu and the armies allied with him, on May 31, Showa 8 (1933), the Kwantung Army and the Beiping Branch of the Military Affairs Committee of the National Government negotiated a ceasefire. At that time, both sides agreed and signed that the Chinese army must not advance to the area north of the line connecting Yanqing, Changping, Gaoliying, Shunyi, Tongzhou, Xianghe, Baodi, Lintingzhen, Ninghe, and Lutai. However, the allied army commanded by the current Army Commander Fang Zhenwu is active in the area north of that line. The Kwantung Army will absolutely not tolerate this action no matter what the reason. Army Commander Fang must immediately begin to withdraw to the area south of the agreed line and completely withdraw by the evening of the 26th. After the 27th, not a single soldier is allowed to remain. This is a strict requirement. If the withdrawal is not fully implemented by the deadline, the Kwantung Army will immediately send troops to suppress it decisively. Declaration, September 22, Showa 8 (1933), Commander of the Great Japanese Army."</p>
<h3 id="e100">He Yingqin's Talk <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>He Yingqin told reporters this morning that Fang Zhenwu's actions had gone beyond the norm. Tang Yulin, Ji Hongchang, Liu Guitang, and others had reportedly not participated. Fang's mask had been torn off, and Tang and others would not willingly support him as their leader. There are suspicious points in Fang's troops gaining passage through Rehe territory to flee into the war zone. However, the Japanese side yesterday made every effort to express that there were communist elements mixed in Fang's and Ji's troops, and the Japanese side was determined to expel them and would absolutely not allow them to stay in the war zone. From this point of view, Fang's troops would not be difficult to resolve, and the overall situation in North China would not be affected. In Huairou, Fang's troops only had Wang Zhongfu's troops of more than two thousand people, with only six to seven hundred guns, a weak force. After obtaining the Japanese side's consent, sending troops to suppress them would be very easy to eliminate. Negotiations are currently underway with the Japanese side. Fang originally had a considerable position, and for the sake of settling matters peacefully, a considerable margin is still being left for him to open a path to self-renewal. As for the small number of bandits of "Old Rat" who fled to Sanhe County, there seems to be no connection with Fang, but because they are more than a hundred miles apart, it is easier to collude. Currently, all the diplomatic and aftermath matters in North China are pending. All parties are eagerly awaiting the return of Chairman Huang (Fu) to the north, and I have also telegraphed him to urge him. I received a reply yesterday, saying that he would go north after completing the "two incidents." Everything will be easier to handle after Chairman Huang arrives. (23rd) Da Songjiang</p>

<p>A man surnamed Gao from Xiatang, Bencheng County, works at a bank in Shanghai. His concubine lives in Songjiang. Two years ago, they bought a girl, initially as an adopted daughter, but later changed her status to a slave. The slave girl is eight years old. For some unknown reason, she was abused by the concubine, with her whole body covered in wounds. The fingertips of both hands were burned and scalded, with obvious burn holes at the fingertips. The most unbearable thing was that she was forced to eat her own excrement. If she disobeyed slightly, she would be severely beaten. The matter was heard by a neighbor surnamed Zhang, who tried to rescue her from the fire pit and asked someone to discuss with the Gao family about letting the girl be adopted, slightly compensating for the cost of food and clothing spent over the years. They have already taken her back to raise her. Thus, this cruel and inhumane abuse has gradually spread. According to the case of Jiang Wang's abuse of her adopted daughter Tangying, which was reported by the hall directors, the court has already punished her.</p>

<p>Suqian County Magistrate Cui Qingshan embezzled public funds and acted illegally, which was reported by someone. The Civil Affairs Department sent Cui to the Jiangsu Higher Court. The first instance sentenced him to two years in prison and fined him 1,000 yuan. Cui refused to accept the verdict and appealed to the Supreme Court, which sent the case back for retrial. The retrial has been concluded, and the verdict was pronounced yesterday (25th), sentencing him to one year and four months in prison and fining him 600 yuan. Cui still expressed his dissatisfaction and planned to file an appeal, requesting to suspend the detention in court. The presiding judge agreed to wait for a ruling.</p>

<p>Qin Heduo, a villager in the Qin Gengshang area of the 442nd Tu, about a mile away from Anzhen in the eighth district of the county, was 54 years old. His wife, Ni, was about the same age. On the evening of the 28th day of the seventh month, after Ah Duo had dinner, he suddenly had a quarrel with his nephew He Sanmei about the redemption of the house. At that time, both sides had drunk a little wine with dinner and were slightly drunk. In a moment of passion, they fought each other. Ah Duo was old and weak and was knocked to the ground by Ah San. His right waist happened to hit the threshold of the back door of Mei Gen's house. It was heard that Ah San also pressed on Ah Duo, causing Ah Duo's waist to be injured, his breath faint, and his breathing unceasing. Afterwards, he was bedridden and in extreme pain. He died of exhaustion the day before yesterday afternoon. The 16th Public Security Bureau of the jurisdiction sent police to detain and arrest the murderers Qin Ah San and Qin Meigen for questioning. The Tu Zheng Qin Fengming (the deceased's brother) was ordered to report to the county court yesterday with the deceased's wife, Ni. The investigating prosecutor held a hearing, and Tu Zheng provided the same information. The deceased's wife requested to waive the autopsy, but the judge refused and ordered them to return. It was decided that the police officers would take the Changshu small wheel to the village for the autopsy at 7 am today to verify the case.</p>

<p>The local party and government organs, in order to aid the rural economy, commissioned Xue Chan and Sun Ren, the district chief of the 11th district, to go to Shanghai to discuss with Zou Bingwen, director of the rural loan department of the Shanghai Bank, to set up a warehouse at the original site of Qingyang Town's Junda Hall, modeled after the Xiaoxian method. Both parties negotiated and agreed to establish it, trying it out for one year, with the opening scheduled for October 15th, starting with agricultural warehouses and commodity storage and mortgage, promoting various production cooperative enterprises, and aiming to revitalize the countryside. If the local environment does not create problems, the cotton cooperative in Shazhou can be established first.</p>

<p>Yesterday at about 3:00 PM, a grass-picking woman in the Boxian Park, on a small path halfway up the mountain that leads to the small wharf, saw a pile of messy grass ahead and immediately went forward to pick it up. Unexpectedly, as soon as she brushed the grass aside, a corpse suddenly appeared before her eyes. The woman was shocked and screamed wildly. The incident was heard by the park office, which immediately ordered the local baojia to report to the court for an autopsy and notified the local public security bureau to send personnel for inspection. The deceased was about twenty years old, with a small, thin build and his face facing the ground. He was wearing a gray-striped spring gown, striped pongee trousers, and square-toed black silk shoes, looking like a small businessman. A black artificial silk trouser belt was wrapped around his neck several times, presumably causing his death.</p>

<p>The entire body of workers in the thread-making industry of Zhenjiang, including Li Jinyong, etc., previously, because the capital side of the industry began implementing a 30% reduction in wages on the 19th of this month, the labor side, in order to avoid disputes, continued to work for three days. On the one hand, they requested the capital side to maintain the original wage rate, and on the other hand, they submitted a petition to the party and government organs requesting mediation, and also expressed their grievances. They stated that even at the original wage rate, they felt that their lives were still difficult, and if it were changed to a 30% reduction, the danger to their lives would be even more precarious, etc. Subsequently, because the capital side did not provide a satisfactory response, the labor side temporarily went on strike yesterday, awaiting the party and government organs to send personnel to mediate, it is said.</p>

<p>Since the beginning of summer this year, there has been little rainfall in the four townships. The highland fields in the northwest two townships have suffered from drought, resulting in no harvest. The villagers in the area have reported to the district head in charge, who has forwarded the reports to the county government for disaster relief. They have also requested that personnel be sent to conduct a re-inspection. County Magistrate Ma, upon receiving the report, intends to personally inspect the area as a basis for submitting a report to the provincial government to request exemption from land taxes.</p>

The disaster victims, supporting the old and carrying the young, rushed to the city to petition the county government and district office to quickly block the breaches and provide relief. The authorities agreed to do so, and the disaster victims left. A total of more than 2,000 households were affected by this disaster, with extremely heavy losses.</p>

<p>The case of Tao Sijin, a female student at the West Lake Art Academy, brutally killing her classmate Liu Mengying was remanded by the Supreme Court to the Higher Court for retrial. The judgment was that Tao Sijin was sentenced to life imprisonment and Xu Qinwen was acquitted. Tao has expressed her acceptance of the verdict. However, the prosecutor believes that the sentence is too lenient and has appealed to the Supreme Court again. Additionally, suspecting that Xu Qinwen and Tao Sijin have joined the Communist Party, a separate case was filed against Xu and Tao for endangering the Republic of China. The Higher Court concluded the trial, and yesterday (the 25th) at 10:00 AM, Judge Fu Guanhua of the Second Criminal Tribunal ordered the bailiffs to bring Tao from the military prison and detention center separately. Xu was in shackles, wearing a dark blue serge suit and black leather shoes. Tao wore a white short shirt and black skirt. Both were quite composed. After the judge questioned them about their age and origin, the judgment was announced: Xu Qinwen was acquitted of the charge of endangering the Republic of China by organizing a group, but knowing that Liu Mengying and others were communists, he continuously harbored and concealed them without reporting, and was sentenced to five years of imprisonment. Tao Sijin was acquitted of the charge of using writing for treasonous propaganda, but was sentenced to five years of imprisonment for the crime of endangering the Republic of China by organizing a group. The number of days in custody before the judgment is confirmed will be deducted from the imprisonment at a rate of two days for one day of imprisonment. If they do not agree, they can appeal within ten days. The judge then ordered Xu Qinwen and Tao Sijin to be taken back into custody.</p>

<p>The Zhejiang Provincial Security Department, based on a confidential report that Zheng Bingquan, a notorious bandit from Sheng County, had fled to Shanghai, dispatched detectives to Shanghai to arrest him and bring him to justice. After questioning, it was confirmed that Zheng Bingquan was Chen Zhongxiao, also known as "Old Thin Knife." He confessed that in April of the lunar calendar last year, he had colluded with others to kidnap Xu Rongqing, the son of Xu Gengchan of Shanggang Village, and Lin Zhangsen of Changpan Village, extorting money and sharing the loot. He also admitted that he used the name Chen Zhongxiao to extort money from two unnamed families in Songjiadun, and then fled to the Shanghai Concession to hide. He denied other cases of murder, arson, and robbery, attributing them to other bandits. He admitted to the kidnapping and extortion of Xu Rongqing and the letter of intimidation. He was sentenced to death according to law. Yesterday (the 25th) at 8:00 AM, personnel were dispatched to the military prison to identify Zheng Bingquan, confirm his identity, and escort him to an open space outside Qingbo Gate for execution by shooting.</p>

<p>American Wheat Price Reduced Before Shipment</p>
<p>Economic Committee Reorganization Expected Next Week</p>
<p>Finances of North China Resolved, Song Not Traveling North for Now</p>
<p>Minister of Finance Song Ziwen, who arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing a few days ago to discuss important official matters and will return to Nanjing next week, met with reporters from various newspapers at his residence at 2:00 PM yesterday. He made the following statements on important issues such as the promotion of American cotton and wheat, the expansion of the Economic Committee, and the finances of North China.</p>
<h3 id="e115">Entrusting the Central Bank with the Sale of American Cotton <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>Song said, the first batch of American cotton will arrive in Shanghai soon, and subsequent batches will be shipped to China in succession. A plan for selling the cotton has been determined, which is to entrust the Central Bank to manage it, and other people will be hired to promote the sales and bear the economic responsibility. The cotton will be sold and the proceeds will be remitted immediately, not sold directly to manufacturers. Since this matter is commercial in nature, Japanese merchants are also not prohibited from purchasing it. The government and manufacturers will fully cooperate. Rumors that American cotton will be exempt from tariffs and sold at a reduced price are all false. In short, the government seeks to neither lose nor gain from the purchase and sale. The future selling price of cotton will depend on the domestic cotton production and the state of the yarn market. As for the high price of American wheat, he has requested the American side to reduce the price slightly, and there is a tendency to agree. The wheat has not yet been loaded on ships and will not arrive in China for several months.</p>
<h3 id="e116">Economic Committee Focuses on Talent <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>The National Economic Committee was originally headed by Mr. Chiang Kai-shek as chairman and me as vice chairman. It has now been decided to reorganize the committee, abolish the chairman system, and replace it with a standing committee consisting of the heads of the Executive Yuan and Legislative Yuan, as well as myself. The committee was established two years ago and usually focuses on practical work, without engaging in publicity. The expenses are also extremely economical. Mr. Chiang has always emphasized the use of technical talent in personnel matters, seeking people based on their skills and not assigning people to positions for which they are not qualified. The committee strives to recruit technical talent from all over the country to dedicate themselves to technical work and aims to detach itself from political relations. It is hoped that the committee organization can be maintained permanently and that the staff can serve with peace of mind. Furthermore, the future Cotton Industry Control Committee or other committees to be established by the Economic Committee will have more participation from people in society and less participation from government personnel. The central government will play a guiding and assisting role. As for the issue of technical cooperation with the League of Nations, people like Rajchman are purely in the position of guest advisors, assisting in the process, and the sovereignty over all facilities remains in our hands. Furthermore, the organizational regulations of the committee have been passed by the Legislative Yuan and were originally scheduled to be reorganized and established within the next few days. However, because I am busy in Shanghai this week and unable to leave, I must return to Nanjing next week, at which time it can be formally established.</p>
<h3 id="e117">Song Himself Will Not Travel North for Now <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the financial problems of North China, before I went to Lushan, I had already discussed a solution with Huang Yingbai, the chairman of the Peiping Political Affairs Reorganization Committee. The most important point now is to save all expenses. As the saying goes, "If you cannot increase revenue, then reduce expenses." The military expenses of North China have now been reduced to the amount during Zhang Hanqing's time in Peiping, which is 4.5 million yuan per month. The amount will be further reduced depending on the situation. In the future, the finances of North China will be directly handled by the Ministry of Finance to avoid any obstacles. As for the rumor that I will travel to North China with Chairman Huang (Fu) to thoroughly reorganize the finances of North China, I have never had such an intention. Currently, there are many affairs in Nanjing and Shanghai, and I cannot spare the time to go elsewhere. Furthermore, since there is already a plan for the finances of North China, there is no need for me to go north.</p>
<h3 id="e118">Imposing Tariffs on Foreign Rice Will Proceed Step by Step <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>Song then discussed the issue of imposing tariffs on imported foreign rice, saying that the imposition of rice tariffs is related to the livelihood of the people of the whole country and is not merely a matter of financial revenue. My opinion on this matter is that the first step is to eliminate the transit tax on domestic rice and at the same time order all provinces to abolish the rice permit tax and all other surtaxes, so that domestically produced rice can circulate freely within the country. This has already been implemented in Jiangsu and Anhui provinces. The second step is to impose a certain restriction on foreign rice, observing the rise and fall of rice prices at any time to verify the surplus or deficiency of domestic rice. If so, then the import of foreign rice can be taxed when it reaches a certain price, and exempted from tax when it exceeds this price. When I proposed this plan, the method was very suitable for regulating domestic food supply, but politicians spread rumors, saying that Guangdong Province relied entirely on rice from Siam and Saigon for maintenance, and that the government's proposal was a poisonous plan to make the people of Guangdong eat tribute rice. As a result, the government was unwilling to cause political disputes over the food issue and did not fully implement it, only discussing it separately with each province. Now that Guangdong has suddenly implemented the collection of foreign rice tax, it proves that the collection of foreign rice tax is necessary to regulate domestic food supply. Now that Guangdong has also felt this point, it is gradually maturing and the method can be fully implemented. As for foreign wheat and flour, the same will be done and will be discussed in detail in the Economic Committee.</p>
<h3 id="e119">Increasing Production in the Lianghuai Reclamation Area <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>I have submitted a proposal to the Executive Yuan for the reclamation of wasteland in the Lianghuai reclamation area. This matter originally belonged to the Ministry of Finance, but because it is related to various agencies, it will be transferred to the National Economic Committee for handling in the future. The motive for my proposal is entirely because the Lianghuai salt area occupies a very large area, and it is a pity to leave it barren. Therefore, we should find a way to have the government advance a huge amount of capital to plan for reclamation. After the budget plan is implemented, it can increase the people's production by 100 million yuan per year. Although it is not directly beneficial to the government, it is a matter of national economy and people's livelihood and should not be delayed, he said.</p>

<p>More Than 11,000 Bales to Arrive in Shanghai on the 29th</p>
<p>The first batch of cotton purchased by our country from the United States with borrowed funds has already been shipped and is on its way and is about to arrive in Shanghai. The details of the arrival and transit of the goods are reported as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e121">Exact Number of Cotton Bales <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>The total number of cotton bales purchased by our country from the United States with borrowed funds is more than 220,000. The first batch was shipped from New Orleans by the Dodwell &amp; Co.'s S.S. "Asia Maru" on August 15th, via the Panama Canal to our country. The exact number of cotton bales loaded on the ship is 11,350. In addition to the cotton, the ship also carried a batch of kerosene for the Texaco Company, which was also shipped to Shanghai for unloading.</p>
<h3 id="e122">No Stopping in Japan <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>The ship was originally scheduled to stop at Kobe, Japan, for two days before coming to Shanghai. However, because the ship was eager to come to Shanghai, Dodwell &amp; Co. telegraphed the shipowner, instructing the ship not to stop when passing through the East Sea and to proceed directly to Shanghai in order to arrive as soon as possible. Yesterday, the shipowner telegraphed that the ship would proceed directly to Shanghai from the Pacific Ocean without stopping en route. However, when the ship entered the Pacific Ocean, it encountered a hurricane. For the sake of safe navigation, the ship dropped anchor to avoid the storm. As a result, the arrival date in Shanghai was later than originally scheduled.</p>
<h3 id="e123">Loading Situation <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>This time, the American cotton purchased by our country is in the name of the national government as the consignee, and the bill of lading lists "Chinese Government Agency." The cotton shipped from the United States is done by a cotton purchasing organization established by our country in the United States, generally using the "Chinese-American Cotton Office for Economic Construction," with the following original English name: Order Reconstruction Finance Corporation Notify Chinese-American Cotton Syndicate.</p>
<h3 id="e124">Exact Date of Arrival in Shanghai <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>The ship is scheduled to arrive at Wusong on the 29th and can enter the port on the morning of the 30th. After arriving in Shanghai, the cotton is scheduled to berth and unload at the China Merchants' Wharf. If another ship is berthed at the wharf, it will be diverted to the Yangtze Wharf.</p>

<p>The newly appointed Soviet Russian Consul General in Shanghai, Mr. Spitvanik, departed from Tokyo the day before yesterday and arrived in Shanghai on the Dollar Line's President Adams yesterday morning at 8:30 AM with his wife and daughter. After landing at the Jianghai Customs Wharf, Mr. Spitvanik went to the Consulate General at No. 1 Huangpu Road to visit the Russian Ambassador Bogomolov and inspected the renovations of the office. It is roughly decided that the Russian Consulate will officially open for business on the first day of next month. It is said that Mr. Spitvanik served as a counselor at the embassy when Karakhan was the ambassador to China during the Beijing government era. After Karakhan returned to his country, Mr. Spitvanik served as the acting ambassador. When China and Russia severed diplomatic relations, he was transferred to Japan. Now he is reappointed as the Consul General in Shanghai and is quite familiar with the situation in China.</p>

<p>Since the outbreak of war in North China, the losses suffered by the people in the war zone are incalculable. After the Tanggu Truce was signed, the government allocated funds for relief, but due to financial difficulties, it was difficult to meet the needs. Therefore, various places have raised funds to assist the government in saving the victims. The municipal government has launched a fundraising campaign, which is currently underway. The Executive Yuan telegraphed the municipal government a few days ago, saying, "Shanghai Municipal Government, I have received your telegram. If the relief funds for the refugees in the North China war zone are raised successfully, please remit them immediately. Premier of the Executive Yuan, Wang Zhaoming." After receiving the order, the municipal government immediately informed the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau.</p>

<p>He Bingxian, the director of the International Trade Bureau of the Ministry of Industry, stated that the sales channels of Chinese silk overseas are becoming increasingly narrow and that it is necessary to find ways to improve it so as to compete with the products of other countries. He has specially scheduled a meeting of leaders of silk industry manufacturers to discuss this matter. Yesterday, he sent letters to Cai Shengbai, Wu Daqiang, and other owners of 17 factories, including Mei Ya, Jinyun, Meiwen, Guohua, Zhenye, Meifeng, Yutong, Jinlong, Baohua, Damei, Tianyi, Qingshi, Dawei, Xingye, Xingya, Shixin, and Jiuxia, inviting them to attend. The original letter stated, "Dear Sirs, Chinese silk has always occupied an important position in foreign trade. In recent years, the products of other countries have been constantly innovating and competing fiercely. Not only are the designs novel, but the prices are also low, which has caused the sales of Chinese silk to decline sharply overseas. If we do not find ways to improve and compete with them as soon as possible, the overseas trade of Chinese silk will gradually disappear. The bureau is aware of this and has scheduled a meeting of Shanghai silk industry leaders on the 29th of this month (Friday) at 3:00 PM at the bureau on the fourth floor of the Jianghai Customs on Hankou Road to discuss the improvement of silk exports.

<h3 id="e133">Fire Insurance Claims Association Demands Compensation from Jardine Matheson. Representatives Injured and Sent to Hospital for Treatment <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, the Fire Insurance Claims Association of the Zhabei Disaster Area publicly elected representatives to demand compensation from foreign firms such as Jardine Matheson and Butterfield &amp; Swire. As a result, they were driven away by the police, resulting in injuries to the representatives. The association has decided to continue to send representatives to proceed today, and the situation is likely to escalate.</p>
<h3 id="e134">Resolution to Demand Compensation <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>The household representatives' meeting believes that foreign firms such as Butterfield &amp; Swire and Jardine Matheson have not yet expressed their views on the compensation issue and has resolved to go to demand compensation and ask for an effective response.</p>
<h3 id="e135">Election of Representatives <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>At 9:00 AM yesterday, the association publicly elected Fang Xi, Wang Zhixiang, members Wang Weigong, Xu Zaikang, Zheng Shaojin, Ma Rugen, and more than 360 household representatives, each wearing the Fire Insurance Claims Association badge, to depart from Baoshan Road. The association prepared food for the representatives when they departed. The order along the way was still good. They first went to the insurance department of Butterfield &amp; Swire to demand compensation. Seven representatives, including Wang Zhixiang, went to the office. The firm said that the Westerner in charge of the insurance department was not there and asked them to contact them again later. The representatives then went to Jardine Matheson at No. 1 Guangdong Road.</p>
<h3 id="e136">Negotiations Fail <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>After 10:00 AM, the representatives went to Jardine Matheson and were also represented by seven people, including Wang, Ma, Zheng, and Xu, to negotiate with the insurance department of the firm. Wang and others submitted a written statement requesting an immediate response. Chen Songyuan, the comprador of Jardine Matheson, said that the matter involved the entire insurance industry and could not be expressed by one insurance firm alone. They must wait for the public to discuss and agree on a solution before they could discuss the solution with the policyholders. Therefore, he showed them his reply. The representatives, unable to get any substantive results, informed the household representatives who came with them. The crowd said that this matter could not be won with words, so fifty or so representatives, including men, women, old, and young, went to the outside of the writing room inside Jardine Matheson and sat down to wait for a solution.</p>
<h3 id="e137">Police Intervention <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>Jardine Matheson believed that dozens of male and female policyholders sitting on the second floor of the writing room were not elegant and hindered the flow of traffic, so they advised them to leave. The representatives refused to leave because they had not received a definite solution. Everyone also carried food, and there was a situation of sitting down outside. The firm immediately telegraphed the police to send officers to come. The officers arrived and persuaded them to leave peacefully. At 11:40 AM, a large team of Chinese and Western police officers rushed to the entrance of the second floor of Jardine Matheson and ordered everyone to leave. The representatives insisted on not agreeing. The Western police officers then ordered the Chinese police officers to forcibly drive them away. The Western police officers even dragged everyone down the stairs. During the commotion, four people were injured and sent to the hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3 id="e138">Representatives Injured <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>Policyholder representative Feng Qibiao, 22 years old, refused to leave when the Western police officers drove them away, and was dragged down from the second-floor stairs by a Western police officer and thrown to the lower level, seriously injured and unable to move. Four other representatives, Zhang Ziming, Cai Tongshan, Lu Yaoquan, and the woman Lin Gen, were either bumped or fell, and were also slightly injured. Each of the remaining people was dragged out by a Chinese police officer, causing the atmosphere on Guangdong Road Bund to suddenly become tense at around 10:00 AM. The injured were sent to the Second Branch of the Red Cross Hospital by the association's vehicles for treatment.</p>
<h3 id="e139">Emergency Meeting <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>After this incident occurred, about 300 household representatives who were waiting for news in the area of ​​Sichuan Road and Wuma Road were notified by Wang Zhixiang, the chairman of the association, and others to return to the association on Baoshan Road to hold an emergency meeting to discuss countermeasures and aftermath matters. For a time, the road was crowded. Jardine Matheson was protected by police officers to prevent a recurrence.</p>
<h3 id="e140">Agreed Solution <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>The reporter received the news and rushed to the association by car to investigate the situation. At that time, the meeting was being held. According to the spokesperson of the association, although the demand for compensation from Jardine Matheson today was frustrated, the association is determined to persevere and continue to fight. In addition to sending a letter to the Chinese Ratepayers' Association of the Concession, requesting that it uphold justice, and issuing a declaration seeking assistance from people in the community, they will decide to send representatives to the firm again tomorrow to negotiate and demand fire insurance compensation, until the goal is achieved. The injured members have been treated in the hospital, and the association is determined to send eight people tomorrow if four people are injured today. Therefore, it is expected that there may be another unfortunate incident today.</p>
<h3 id="e141">Submit Documents to the Party and Government <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>The document is submitted to the authorities requesting strict negotiations regarding the repeated assault on disaster victims by the police and to quickly determine a solution. The association is in the disaster area, and the fire insurance compensation in the disaster area has been negotiated for a long time, but there is no solution. The association continues to demand compensation in order to find a solution. However, since the compensation has continued, the insurance firms have not refused, and the insurance association has been unanimously entrusted to be responsible for the solution. However, in the process of demanding compensation, the police have repeatedly failed to understand the suffering of the disaster victims and have intervened arbitrarily, resulting in the incident that the previous compensation committee member Song Liangcai was violently beaten and injured by a Western police officer. The association has already reported this case. Unexpectedly, this morning, disaster victims went to Jardine Matheson on Wuma Road to demand compensation. Dozens of Chinese and Western detectives from the police station suddenly came and arbitrarily beat the disaster victims who were demanding compensation, which was extremely tyrannical and inhumane. Among those seriously injured were Feng Qibiao, Zhang Ziming, Cai Tongshan, Lin Gen, Chen Zhaotang, and others. They have been sent to the Red Cross Hospital for treatment. However, the police are so disregarding of justice that the agency should negotiate with the authorities. However, the long-term dispute in this case is ultimately not a social blessing. Therefore, we respectfully ask the agency to review and approve and quickly determine a solution to protect the lives of the policyholders and maintain social security. We are extremely grateful. The submission is omitted below.</p>

<p>The rise and fall of Chinese tea is closely related to the market, rescuing the African market and resisting the oppression of Japanese tea.</p>
<p>This is the most important and urgent task at present.</p>
<p>The sales situation of Chinese tea in Africa, according to Ji Zejin, the director of the Guidance Office of the International Trade Bureau, said yesterday:</p>
<h3 id="e143">Our Country's Tea Leaves <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>Each year, the amount sold to foreign countries is approximately 400,000 to 500,000 dan (a unit of weight). Green tea accounts for about three-quarters of the total. Among these, the export of Chun Mee and other varieties to French Africa reaches over 150,000 dan annually, with a total value exceeding ten million yuan. This trade has traditionally been</p>
<h3 id="e144">Handled by Foreign Merchants <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>for resale. Because there has been no direct relationship between tea merchants and African tea merchants, the mediation of foreign merchants has led to fraudulent practices such as coloring and adulteration.</p>
<h3 id="e145">Japanese Tea Competition <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>Japanese merchants have exploited this weakness in our country. In the past three years, they began competing with Chinese tea in the African market. Based on the principle of direct sales, they conducted vigorous propaganda to undermine Chinese tea, such as distributing various explanatory documents pointing out that Chinese tea contains toxic pigments, is adulterated, and is manufactured in a dirty and unsanitary manner. They boasted that Japanese green tea is purely the natural color of tea leaves, without any coloring or adulteration, and that it has been proven by famous medical professionals to contain large amounts of vitamins, and so on. Since our country has no direct agency stationed in Africa, we have been unable to refute these claims. Africans, failing to investigate, have taken our silence as tacit approval. Thus, they initially felt doubt, then trust. The sales of Japanese tea in Africa have increased rapidly. In three years, the import of Japanese tea into Africa has grown from six tons to two thousand tons, accounting for a quarter of the total tea imports. The urgency and danger facing the future of Chinese tea is evident.</p>
<h3 id="e146">Investigation by Authorities <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>The result of this aggressive dumping by Japanese tea and the real situation of coloring and adulteration of Chinese tea have attracted the attention of the French African colonial government. In order to understand the truth, they have sent a document to the French Indochina colonial government, specially dispatching tea expert Mr. Goubeaux to conduct an on-site investigation in both China and Japan. According to Mr. Goubeaux, his visit to Japan will focus on the organization of tea exporters and whether they have political backing. In China, he will focus on the cleanliness and hygiene of manufacturing procedures and the real situation of coloring and adulteration.</p>
<h3 id="e147">Relief Measures <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>Since our country's black tea market has been seized by Indian, Ceylonese, and Javanese black teas, only green tea exports remain considerable. Among green tea exports, only sales to Africa are the largest. Aside from Russia, the rest are all small and scattered. Therefore, the African market is the lifeline of our country's foreign-traded tea, and its rise and fall are most critical to our country's tea market. If Africa is lost, millions of tea farmers in our country will be forced into banditry. Therefore, saving the African tea market and resisting the oppression of Japanese tea is currently the most important and urgent task. After the African government amends the import regulations for colored tea this year, it will give Japanese tea more convenient sales opportunities. The tragic defeat of Chinese tea in the United States in the past is about to be repeated today. Although our country's government has regulations for tea inspection, because there is no direct sales organization, the regulations are ineffective. Even if they are勉强 enforced to comply with the import regulations of the African government, foreign merchants will further tighten tea market prices for profit, making it impossible for Chinese tea manufacturers and tea farmers to sustain themselves, leading to bankruptcy. Therefore, the government should send special personnel with all tea merchants on the sea to Africa to investigate the situation in detail, resist the propaganda of Japanese tea, and establish the first step of direct relationship between African tea merchants and sea tea merchants. At the same time, inland manufacturers should unite and collaborate. When the opportunity matures, take the second step of direct sales. And when the production and sales cooperatives of tea farmers in various places have a complete organization, take the third step, the final step of direct sales. Otherwise, Chinese tea will continue to be manipulated by foreign merchants, and in the not-too-distant future, it will disappear overseas.</p>
<h3 id="e148">Japanese Coal Dumping Causes Domestic Coal Prices to Fall <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>The Domestic Coal Relief Association is Discussing Relief Methods</p>
<p>According to coal market news, the price of domestic coal has fallen by about 30 cents per dan. The decline is more significant for coal from the Kailuan Mining Administration. The reason is the dumping of Japanese coal in China. The method of Japanese coal dumping is that purchasers do not need to pay cash. Therefore, a group of unscrupulous merchants are competing to purchase coal for profit and waiting for a shortage of coal on the market to raise prices. Domestic coal is more difficult to transport and is also squeezed by the dumping, causing sales prices to fall. The Domestic Coal Relief Association is currently discussing relief methods.</p>

However, the Finance Bureau, due to current financial difficulties, hopes that the committee will reduce the original budget to the minimum. Therefore, the budget should be resubmitted for discussion today. (2) On the day of the inauguration ceremony, there will be a review of Boy Scouts, Security Teams, Defense Corps, Police Brigades, and Fire Brigades in the city center. (3) The eighth meeting of this committee discussed and decided to hold the National Day celebration and the inauguration ceremony at the same time. Because of the national crisis, all celebrations have been suspended, and there is no need to submit a request for instructions again. Committee Member Chen Jun reported on the financial difficulties of the city. Sun Yongyi reported that the chrysanthemum exhibition decided last time could not be held because the chrysanthemums would not be in bloom at that time. Committee Member Wen Yiru reported that it was difficult to transport the large number of Security Team and police personnel for the parade in the city center. Committee Member Zhang Binghui introduced Mr. Ye Weiyi, an official in charge of the National Goods Exhibition, who reported that the National Goods Association planned to hold an automobile parade and perform entertainment in the city center on October 10. However, if the Municipal Government Auditorium could not be used, the National Goods Association would not have enough funds to build a shed for the entertainment show. He also proposed seeking ways to use airplanes to distribute National Goods leaflets. (B) Discussion Items: (1) Re-discuss the budget for the inauguration ceremony.

<p>Will be Held in Beijing as Scheduled</p>
<p>A telegram from Nanjing states that the Shanghai Merchant Ship Drivers Association has requested to extend the period for the seafarer certification examination and move it to Shanghai. The Ministry believed that the reasons stated were not without merit and should be considered for future adoption. However, this certification examination is not a widespread event and has already been notified to the seafarers who are required to take the examination. It is not appropriate to change it, so it has been decided to hold the examination in Beijing as scheduled.</p>
<h3 id="e151">A Record of the Typhoon and Flood Disaster in Chuansha and Nanhui <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>On September 2nd, a hurricane passed through Shanghai, and the seawalls in the coastal areas of Chuansha and Nanhui counties in Pudong were mostly destroyed. Fields and houses near the sea were almost completely washed away. The most severely affected areas were Hengsha, Neigaodun Township, Xinsha Township, and Yuanyuansha in Chuansha. There were refugees everywhere, sleeping in the open and eating in the wind. Local officials and gentry were urgently repairing and providing relief, but their efforts were a drop in the bucket. Realizing the severity of the disaster, our newspaper specially sent Li Zunyong to take photographs, and Shen Zijian, in his capacity as a member of the Pudong Fellow-Villagers Association, went to survey the disaster. They agreed to travel together. When they arrived at Laogang, which belongs to Nanhui County, they encountered the second typhoon and flood on the 18th. Seeing the disaster situation, they felt even more saddened. Now, we have organized the diary and written a survey report, along with seventeen early photographs. From our newspaper, we went to Dongjiadu, took the Southbound bus to Zhoupu, and transferred to a small vehicle. It was a Sunday, and passengers with party membership and teachers wearing party badges were exempt from fares. At 6 PM, we arrived at Nanhui. We visited County Magistrate Yuan, who explained the current situation in the disaster area and the route of the inspection in detail. He also summoned Yang, the First District Chief of Nanhui, to the office to report on the disaster situation. We also visited Xu Shinai, who said that this time, the sea tide was fortunately a northeast wind, so the submerged areas were flooded with fresh Yangtze River water. If it had been a southeast wind and the floodwater was salty, not only would there be no hope for the autumn harvest, but it would probably not be possible to cultivate the land for two or three years. That night, we stayed in a hotel. At 10 AM the next morning, we went to Laogang. When we set off, there was already wind and rain. The boat was small, and Zijian and Li huddled in the cabin. When we arrived at Laogang Town in Wanggongtang, our clothes were soaked. We changed to a rowboat and went to Ligongtang, which is the port of Laogang. We saw that the cotton, soybeans, sweet potatoes, and other crops planted in the fields were submerged in water. There was a coffin, of unknown origin, floating by, and no one cared about it. (With photograph) At that time, the northeast wind was howling, and the rain was pouring. The farmers in Ligongtang, mindful of the ferocity of the first typhoon and flood, were fleeing in groups. (With photograph)</p>
<h3 id="e152">(Floating Coffin, Photographed by Li Zunyong) <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>While in the rowboat, Zijian's umbrella was broken by the wind. (With photograph) Climbing up Ligongtang, he was almost blown over. Unable to withstand the wind, he abandoned the umbrella and stood on the embankment. Looking into the distance at the collapsed embankments north of Laogang, he saw farmers in the remaining thatched huts carrying their belongings and fleeing to Wanggongtang. Ligongtang is near the sea and about four li from Wanggongtang. He had visited the embankment construction project in previous years. Seeing the port of Laogang, it was different from before. He asked the locals, who said that Ligongtang had collapsed several times, receding dozens of zhang.</p>
<p>The rivers between Wanggongtang and Ligongtang were crisscrossed and evenly spaced, looking like the Chinese character 田. The riverbanks were very low, only about a foot above the water surface, making it easy for them to be flooded during high tide. After the hurricane on September 2nd destroyed the seawalls, the cotton, soybeans, and other crops planted in the fields were submerged in water for three to five days. Some of the plants had mud clinging to their leaves, and the entire plants died. But many of the crops still had one or two chances of survival. This month, however, they were hit by a second typhoon and flood, completely destroying them. According to the town chief, more than 250 corpses and more than 1,300 people, big and small, were in the affected area.</p>
<p>The farmers outside Wanggongtang are from Tongzhou and Haimen, while the farmers inside the embankment are mostly from Chongming. They have lived inside for decades. The farmers inside and outside the embankment are all tenant farmers. The landlords, in addition to Widow Relief, Infant Nurturing, and Universal Relief Halls, are all local landowners. The rent ranges from five yuan to five jiao.</p>
<p>Zijian stood on Ligongtang, almost blown away by the strong wind and rain, and went to the foot of the embankment. He entered a farmer's house, where the chicken coop was under the table and the pigsty was connected to the bed. People and animals lived together. But to avoid the wind and rain, it seemed like a mansion. Li braved the rain to photograph the collapsed embankment. (With photograph) It was said that the collapsed embankment stretched for more than 200 zhang from Laogang to Erzaohong. We returned to Laogang Town in a rowboat, changed clothes at the inn, which was just a low house made of reed mats and plastered with lime. The rain leaked through the roof. We originally planned to start from Laogang Town and go north to Wutuan and Chuansha. The inn had a south-facing window with glass, and looking out at the wind and rain made people shudder. The merchants in the town said that with this wind, the sea tide would probably be even worse than the previous one. They were all planning to evacuate. The people on the street all covered their heads with burlap sacks. The innkeeper was an old woman. (With photograph) Knowing that we had come to survey the disaster, she treated us cordially, drying our wet clothes and serving hot tea. She said that transportation in Laogang Town was extremely inconvenient when it rained. So Li and I decided to take the original boat back to Nanhui. The wind and rain were even heavier on the way. When we arrived in the city, it was already 7 PM. We still stayed in the hotel, and all our clothes were wet. We wrapped ourselves in a woolen blanket, and the lamp flickered on and off until it went out completely at 11 PM. That night, there was a strong wind and rain, and some walls in the city collapsed. Outside the West Gate, a female worker was blown into the river while holding an umbrella and drowned. On the 19th, the Nanhui Land Passenger Wheel, all suspended operation. At 9:30 AM, the Chuansha Passenger Wheel, came from Sandun, through here. Since Li's clothes were completely wet and he had caught a cold the day before, he could not go. In the afternoon, the wind and rain eased slightly, and we visited Xiangguang Tower, where Dong Qichang studied. (With photograph) That day, we were staying in the Anju Hotel, and we heard that Laogang Town had been submerged. The inn where we had planned to stay the night before was already in the water. On the 20th, County Magistrate Yuan sent Director Ling to accompany us to Wutuan. We took a boat to Zhuqiao Town, and the Public Security Bureau sent police officers and police to escort us. (With photograph) We surveyed from Panjia Hong to Wangjia Hong, belonging to Wutuan and Liutuan. That section of Ligongtang had not been destroyed, but one-tenth of the shore shed outside the embankment (i.e., the weir built by the businesses) was destroyed. Farmers were afraid and slept in the open on the embankment. (With photograph) When we were at Panjia Hong, some farmers heard that we had arrived and came in groups to ask for food, kneeling on the ground and pulling us so that we could not move. We were saddened by this, and the police officers persuaded them kindly before they let us go. (With photograph) We walked on the weirs that had not been destroyed, for about a mile, and locusts flew around us and attached themselves to our bodies. The weirs in Qiujia Road in Liutuan were not destroyed, but the weirs in Nijia Road, Shijia Road, and Zhangjia Road were all destroyed. At Majia Road, there was a large fishing boat stranded at the foot of Ligongtang. When asked how it got there, they said that it was washed in by the tide and could not be moved. Walking north along Ligongtang, we only saw disaster victims on the embankment, setting up bamboo and wooden shelters for lodging, and hanging wet clothes and quilts on bamboo poles to dry. From a distance, it looked like a market or temple fair in the north. Downslope of the embankment, there were piles of messy rice straw, broken tables, wooden beds, pots and stoves, and broken wood and bamboo, etc., for 30 or 40 miles along Ligongtang, with no place untouched, which were floating homes, blown by the northeast wind, parked at the bottom of the embankment. When farmers look for their possessions and cannot identify them, there are often disputes. By the time we surveyed Qituan, it was late, so we went to Jiangjia Road. The police officers and police returned to Zhuqiao, and we and Director Ling went to Chuansha to visit County Magistrate Li. County Magistrate Li had just returned from surveying the weirs in Batuan and Jiutuan. We talked in the office. His secretary, Mr. Shen, was the son of Shen Yugang and He Jing, who was an old friend of us. That night, we stayed at Zhiyuan Hall.</p>
<p>On the 21st, we surveyed from Changtang in Chuansha and saw that the slope of Ligongtang was planted with locust trees. (With photograph) And the Ligongtang in the boundary of Nanhui did not have this protection. We asked, and it was planted by the Chuansha Farm. The fields below the embankment belonged to the Chuansha County Education Bureau. The disaster situation outside the embankment was no different from that of Liutuan and Qituan. When we arrived at Sanjiagang, we saw three tile houses that had not collapsed. (With photograph) Looking at their foundations, they were filled about four feet higher than the ground. During the high tide, water entered the house and did not submerge the walls. Thus, we knew that all the thatched houses outside the embankment from Wutuan to Qituan to Shisantuan that had not collapsed also had higher foundations. When we arrived at Liujia in Batuan, a man named Zhao Xiaogou and his entire family of five were crushed to death by a washed-away house, and the head embankment was destroyed. (With photograph) Li's photographic materials were used up, so he took the Shangchuan bus from Bailongjiang to Xiaowan and returned to the newspaper.</p>
<p>Early on the 22nd, we took the Shangchuan bus from Xiaowan to Bailongjiang, took the patrol boat of the Chuansha County Government, and crossed Hengsha. Before entering the harbor, we saw a corpse floating in the sea. At 3 PM, we arrived at the Sixth District Office in Wenyu Town. We were accompanied by the local Public Security Bureau chief to inspect the old weir. We saw a woman, about twenty years old, arranging wet clothes on the Shencang weir. When asked her name, she seemed shy and refused to answer. An older woman, about fifty years old, came out from a reed mat next to her, answering politely. We knew that she was a member of some family, from the upper class, still living in the open. We could know the rest by analogy. There were Chen Xie and his shop giving porridge in Wenyu South Street, and dozens of people came to eat. (With photograph) Hengsha suffered even more severely due to its geography. It was beyond the power of my clumsy pen to describe. That night, we stayed at the District Office.</p>
<p>Nanhui and Chuansha face the sea on the east. Outside, there are Qinchanggong Tang, Wanggong Tang, and Ligong Tang, which protect the embankment and are all in a straight line. Outside Ligong Tang, there are still people's weirs. What was destroyed was only more than 200 characters of Ligong Tang and the people's weirs in each group. Hengsha is isolated in the sea, facing the sea on all sides. The owners enclose weirs on the ground, summon tenants, and collect rent. The tenants are also from Chonghai. The rent ranges from five yuan to 36 cents.</p>
<p>Early on the 23rd, we departed from the District Office and surveyed from Wanzhi Township to Houde Township and Wengqing Township. We saw that the uncollapsed houses were completely submerged in water. People traveled back and forth with round wooden tubs or bamboo rafts. (With photograph) The carcasses of dead livestock still had a lot of stench. Each township has weirs with weir workers, which are called weir cuts in the Hengsha dialect. We traveled to the weir cuts, and the farmers fought to carry us on their backs. A man named Xuelang followed us for several miles, carrying us three times. Dear compatriots, suffering such a catastrophe, how can we not be moved by compassion?</p>
<p>We returned from Houde Township and arrived at Gaodun Township, when we heard a loud gong. The Public Security Bureau chief who was traveling with us sent police to inquire and learned that they wanted to ask for exemption from land rent. We told them that we were busy with emergency relief these days, so how could we have rent? Fearing that they were taking the opportunity to incite unrest, we ordered them to be taken to the District Office, and they were released that night. When we arrived at Gaodun Weir, we encountered two French priests who were also inspecting and providing relief. (With photograph) We rested in the warehouse of the Education Public Group in Fengle Town. The farmers heard that we had arrived and came in groups to request emergency relief. People without clothes, food, or shelter could not last long with only three or four days of grain. The people who traveled with us told them that the Chuansha County Government had allocated 200 shi of relief rice, 100 of which were purchased and transported from Shanghai and would arrive within two days. We also pointed to us and said that the Pudong Fellow-Villagers Association had sent us to inspect and that the great philanthropists of Shanghai had contacted various organizations to raise relief funds, hoping that everyone would temporarily be quiet and not be agitated. First, the warehouse of the Education Public Group had selected tenants to repair the weir as a form of work-for-relief and urged them to work quickly and not rely solely on relief grain. The farmers gradually dispersed. That night, we stayed in the warehouse. (Note: Due to space limitations, we could not publish all of the above organizations.) On the morning of the 24th, we hired a sampan and originally planned to detour around Yuanyuansha and enter the Wusong Estuary. It happened to be a southeast wind, so we thought that the journey would be quick. Unexpectedly, when we exited, it was very difficult to steer the boat because it was large and the port was small, costing about an hour. When we arrived at the east of Yuanyuansha, we calculated the journey. If we lingered in Yuanyuansha, we would have to wait for the tide outside the Wusong Estuary tonight. Our companions advised us not to go ashore, saying that the disaster situation in Yuanyuansha had been reported to the Chuansha County Government and that the situation was similar to that of Hengsha. We had no choice but to look at the beach from a distance and saw only one or two thatched sheds. When we arrived outside the Wusong Estuary, we saw that the stone embankment on the west beach had also been destroyed. We took the Shanghai-Nanjing train and saw that the cotton and rice in the Wusong area were also submerged in water. We arrived at the newspaper at 7 PM.</p>

<p>The Judicial Yuan Clearly Explains the Instruction Received by the Municipal Government</p>
<p>The Municipal Government yesterday issued an instruction from the Executive Yuan, stating: "It is found that the Ministry of Interior has previously submitted a report stating that the Civil Affairs Department of Zhejiang has submitted a report requesting an explanation of the ambiguities in the execution of cases successfully mediated by the district, township, and town mediation committees. The report was forwarded to the Judicial Yuan for explanation. The Ministry of Judicial Administration also submitted its opinion on the case, requesting consideration and implementation. The case was then merged and forwarded to the Judicial Yuan for explanation. Now, we have received Advisory Letter No. 961 from the Judicial Yuan, stating that the Legal Interpretation Meeting of the Court has resolved that civil cases that have been legally mediated by the court before litigation have the same effect as a final judgment, as stipulated in Article 15 of the Civil Mediation Law. In accordance with Article 4 of the Civil Procedure Execution Rules, compulsory execution can be enforced. As for the mediation conducted by district, township, and town mediation committees, since there is no clear stipulation that it can be used as a basis for execution, if one party does not comply with the mediation agreement, in addition to filing a lawsuit with the local court to confirm the establishment of the mediation and ordering payment, execution may not be requested." In light of this, in addition to issuing separate orders, the original reports of the Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Judicial Administration are hereby copied and issued, so that you may be informed and instruct your subordinates to be informed. This order is attached, briefly.</p>

<p>Further Trial of the Xu Leqing Kidnapping Case, Wu Youshan, et al.</p>
<h3 id="e156">Wu Cites a Buyer for an American Insurance Company as a Witness, Saying That He Was on His Way to Discuss a Mortgage When the Incident Occurred <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>Xu Said in the Hospital That the Kidnappers in Western Suits Were Extremely Handsome</p>
<p>Xu Leqing, a broker at the Shanghai Stock Exchange, left his residence at 167 Yu Yuan Road at 9:25 AM on the 1st of this month to go to the Exchange to conduct business. He was about to take a public bus on Haig Road in Jing'an Temple when two kidnappers suddenly threatened him with guns, intending to force him into a car, number 6669, which had been parked by the side of the road. Because Xu refused, he was shot, causing his death. The kidnappers fled. Later, Chief Inspector Lu Liankui, Detectives Liu Shaokui, Feng Zhiming, Dong Zhaobin, Song Bingzheng, and others of the General Inspection Office successively apprehended eight kidnappers in the British and French Concessions, Wu Youshan, Dong Zilian, Wu Ziqiu, etc., and sent them to the First Special District Court to give false confessions. This has been reported in our newspaper. Yesterday afternoon, the further hearing of the case was held. The defendants hired lawyers Zhang Shizhao, Xiang Xun, Ye Fukang, Hong Shihao, etc., to defend them. First, the Detective Bureau's lawyer, Wang Yaotang, stated that during the previous hearing, a Western ticket inspector from the public bus company, Ago Gos, had pointed out the first defendant, Wu Youshan, as being at the scene at the time. However, Wu's defense was that on the morning of September 1st, he had gone to the American Insurance Company at 17 The Bund to</p>
<h3 id="e157">Visit the Buyer, Yu Jinman <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>The Detective Bureau sent Detective Liu Shaokui and Western Detective Chief Kalerber to the American Insurance Company to investigate. According to Yu, he could not remember the incident. However, Yu has also come to court today. Wu also stated that Lu Jinlun, an employee of the Yongyu Yarn Factory on Xiaoshadu Road, lives at 8 Lane 316 of Kexuesi Road in the French Concession. Lu is the nephew of Lu Gongwang and has left Shanghai for Weihaiwei, so no results were found. At this point, Ye Fukang, the lawyer representing the defendant Dong Zilian, stated that Dong has been operating a Samsung Watch Company on Fourth Avenue for many years and has joined the Watch Industry Association. The Watch Industry Association has already</p>
<h3 id="e158">Sent an Official Letter to the Court as Proof <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>When questioned, Wu Youshan stated that he works at the Far Eastern Petroleum Company. From 9 to 10 AM on September 1, he went to the American Insurance Company on the Bund to find Yu Jinman. Yu is the manager of the American Insurance Company, so they talked in the manager's office. At that time, there was only a female clerk watching. He and Yu had occasional contact due to business relations. On that day, his fellow villager Lu Gongwang had entrusted him a month earlier to mortgage antiques for 50,000 yuan, so he went to the American Insurance Company to discuss it with Yu. In the end, it was unsuccessful, but Yu agreed to consider it further and they dispersed. Yu Jinman then claimed to be from Guangdong and a manager at the American Insurance Company. He and Wu Youshan had been colleagues in Zhejiang, so they discussed it. He went to my office to ask about it. There was an occasion because of Far East</p>

<p>Yesterday, the Japanese-language Mainichi Shimbun in this city reported that the Japanese chief Monbetsu Mitsuzo (39 years old) arrived in Shanghai on the Changsha Maru, imported from Keelung, Taiwan. He is the Director of Lectures at the Ainu Research Institute in Asahikawa, Hokkaido, Japan, and is traveling to various places to give lectures under the orders of the Ministry of Education. He wears Daizō eyeglasses, a mustache, and a Western suit. At first glance, he looks like a gentleman and bears no resemblance to an Ainu. He has completely changed his original appearance. He and his wife, daughter, and younger sister are currently staying at the Yifengli Inn on Kunshan Road, towards Japan.</p>

<p>The reporter published a statement as follows: "My trip is at the behest of the Ministry of Education, with the purpose of explaining the situation of the Japanese barbarians. I have researched their life from the Stone Age three thousand years ago to the present day, and the changes in their national concepts and thinking during that time. Last year, I went to Manchuria and Korea to give lectures on this topic. This September, I departed from Tokyo for Taiwan, touring the entire island and giving seven or eight lectures every day. Now I have arrived in Shanghai and am also giving lectures on the situation of the Japanese barbarians, so that all parties may understand. It is also heard that after his lectures, he and his family will perform unique folk songs and dances."</p>

<p>I once contacted them about insurance business; this was five or six months ago. In the last three or four weeks, Wu came to me again about an antique business, wanting to mortgage for 50,000 yuan, but I did not agree. Furthermore, according to the testimony of witness Guo Yonglian, I am a chemist, residing at No. 302, Jiaozhoufang, Jiaozhou Road. This morning, because I wanted to go to the company at No. 257, Henan Road to handle some business, I first hired a rickshaw to the public bus station at Jing'an Temple Road and got off, intending to transfer to a public bus. The time was 9:15 a.m. Because it was still early and the public bus had not arrived at the station, I stepped into the nearby Happy also Barber Shop to rest for a while. Before I entered the shop, I saw two people grabbing and arguing. One was wearing a Western suit, with a thin face and tall stature</p>
<h3 id="e163">Facial Features are Quite Fierce <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>The other was wearing Chinese clothing, with a round face and shorter stature than the one in the Western suit. I thought it was an ordinary quarrel, so I did not pay attention at first. When I stepped into the shop, I suddenly heard a gunshot outside. I was so frightened that I fell to the ground. Then I saw the person in Chinese clothing also fall to the ground, unable to get up. The person in the Western suit was nowhere to be seen. Judge Wu Tingqi ordered Guo to identify in court whether there were any kidnappers present at the time. After Guo examined, he replied that he could not recognize them clearly. Furthermore, according to the testimony of witness Xu Rangqing, I am from Ningbo, engaged in the silk business. The deceased, Xu Leqing, was my brother. He has two sons, named Ruifu and Gencai. When the incident happened, I did not know about it. After Xu was sent to the Red Cross, I went to visit him. At that time, his robe had already been taken off. Because he was dizzy, he did not say anything. The next day, I went to visit him again, and Leqing told me about the kidnapping, saying that</p>
<h3 id="e164">The Kidnappers Were Dressed in Western Clothing <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>They looked very elegant, like merchants. He didn't say much more. Furthermore, according to Feng Maoda, I work at the gauze exchange. Xu Leqing is my cousin. At around 10 a.m. this morning, I heard people at the exchange say that Xu Leqing had been kidnapped and injured. Because of our kinship, I immediately took a car to Xu's house, and then went to the Red Cross to visit him. Leqing told me about the kidnapping situation. His testimony was generally the same as Xu Rangqing's. Judge Wu, upon questioning this, deemed it necessary to reschedule the investigation of this case, and ordered that this case be heard again on the afternoon of October 5th. The defendants were still remanded in custody.</p>
<h3 id="e165">A Humorous Episode of a Bride Eloping <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>Twice the Car Arrived but She Refused to Come; The Old Man was Ashamed and Angry and Even Wanted to Throw Himself into the River</p>
<p>The Groom Sees the Father-in-Law to Negotiate Extensively; Intensifying the Search and Temporarily Not Litigating</p>
<p>Shu Fanglai of Yangzhou, living above the Luoyang Shoe Store on the Bund, French Concession, has a son named Kaike, who is 24 years old. Since childhood, Shu Fangzhang relied on four matchmakers who were friends, Wang Zhengkun, Mrs. Shu Zhai, Mrs. Wang Xie, and An You, to betroth to him Ji Juyuan's daughter, Xiaolianzi (now 17 years old), from the same village, as his daughter-in-law. Over the past week, both parents, because Kaike and Xiaolianzi have both come of age, are suitable for marriage, so the original matchmaker, Wang Zhengkun, and others, travelled between the two families to discuss the bride price, totaling 160 yuan. However, Shu has always been a shoemaker and lacks savings at home. How could he come up with such a large amount of silver at once? Although he tried his best to ask his relatives and friends for help, he still failed to collect the money. Therefore, he asked the matchmaker Hu to go to the bride's home again to explain that the previously agreed bride price of 160 yuan should be cancelled, but the bride's clothes and ornaments, and all the equipment in the new room, should be prepared by the groom's family, so the bride's family need not prepare a dowry. Ji also agreed at the time, and then chose the 24th of this month to hold the wedding. However, Ji's daughter, Xiaolianzi, because the groom's family still wanted to temporarily change the agreed bride price of only 160 yuan and could not come up with it, which showed how poor the family was, and thinking that after she married into the family in the future, her daily life would be unimaginable, she asked her father to carry out the cancellation of the marriage. However, Ji refused because this matter was related to his reputation. Seeing that her father did not agree, Xiaolianzi was unhappy all day long. In the blink of an eye, the auspicious day (the day before yesterday) had arrived. Because Shu's house was small, he rented the Dahonglou Restaurant on Wuma Road, hanging lanterns and decorations, and making great preparations. Guests filled the door, and it was very lively. When it was time for the wedding in the evening, Shu sent a car he had prepared to the bride's house at No. 7 Youche Wharf, Nanshi, to pick up the bride. Unexpectedly, even after going twice, the bride was not brought back. All the guests were greatly suspicious, and there was much discussion. Shu, because his face had been completely lost, wanted to throw himself into the Pubin River to commit suicide. After the groom Kaike and others repeatedly persuaded him, he stopped. On one hand, he immediately forced the original matchmaker Zheng Kun to go straight to the bride's house by car at about 2 a.m. yesterday morning to question his father-in-law Ji Juyuan and ask where the bride had gone and why she refused to get into the car (the wedding car). At this point, Ji had to apologize again and again, and explained that Xiaolianzi had privately escaped last night (the 23rd). Even now, although he had searched everywhere, there was still no trace of her. When the new groom heard this, he thought that the bride's family intended to renege on the marriage, and grabbed his father-in-law, demanding to hand him over to the police officer Tian Xiaoquan of the 25th Precinct. The police officer then brought him to the First District, First Precinct, where the director preliminarily interrogated him. Shu Kaike suddenly agreed to his father-in-law's request, giving him a period of time to intensify the search. As soon as the girl was found, he would immediately send her to his home, so he did not want to litigate anymore. The director, because both parties did not pursue the matter further, ordered them to leave the precinct and resolve the matter amicably. A humorous episode of a bride eloping thus came to a temporary end.</p>

<p>A Stinking Negotiation Led to a Death; An Arrest Warrant Issued and the Woman Commited a Great Disaster</p>
<p>Cui Laosan, a Chongming native, 45 years old, lived at No. 22, Bao'an Division Road, Hujia Muqiao, Hongkou. A tenant, A'er, lived in his house. A'er was a night soil collector. At about 2 p.m. the day before yesterday, he went out to dump the night soil. The night soil cart was parked in front of the iron shop opened by Chen Yang, and the foul smell spread everywhere, directly hitting people's noses. Chen was furious and ordered the cart to leave. A conflict broke out between the two sides. Cui Laosan passed by and tried to mediate, but Chen continued to roar. Cui then said that there was no need to argue with this shrew, and to wait for her husband to return home to settle the score. Chen thought that Cui's words were disrespectful, so she stepped forward and slapped Cui Laosan in the face. Cui suffered this great humiliation. In his mind, a man slapped in the face by a woman was extremely unlucky. He refused to let the matter rest. Neighbors mediated, and Cui went home with his head lowered. He immediately collapsed on the bed. Unexpectedly, at about 8 p.m., Cui Laosan died of anger. His family reported that he had died from being beaten, so they reported to the Third Precinct of the Fifth District and had Chen arrested. Yesterday, they ordered the Baodi Li A'er to report to the Temple Court for an autopsy.</p>

<p>They Initially Entered an Agreement to Live Together Intimately</p>
<p>But Suddenly Abandoned Her as if She Was a Stranger</p>
<p>Chen Hailun Came to the Door to Demand Alimony</p>
<p>She Was Grabbed and Brought to the Station by a Gatekeeper</p>
<p>Chen Was Furious and Planned to File a Criminal Lawsuit</p>
<p>The dancing girl, Chen Hailun, when she went to the Paris Cinema to watch a movie last winter, was introduced by another dancing girl, Xue Meimei, to Xu Qizhong, the son of Xu Guannan, a prominent family in Wuxian. Xu saw Chen's beautiful appearance and was amazed by her. From then on, he followed her every day, and often went to Chen's residence at Nianwu Village, Fuxu Road, to invite Chen out, either to the cinema or to the dance hall, and was very intimate. On May 5th of this year, Chen and Xu, because of their close relationship, went to the law firm of Yan Luqing together to sign a cohabitation agreement, stating that if Xu terminated the agreement in the future, he would have to pay 30,000 yuan in alimony. Unexpectedly, on the afternoon of the third day of the previous month, Xu invited Chen to the Da Guangming to watch a movie as a pretext, and took the opportunity</p>
<p>to return home and took all of his belongings away. By the time Chen found out and went home, it was too late. After that, Xu disappeared. Therefore, Chen often went to Xu's house at No. 61, North Zhejiang Road, to demand that the contract be fulfilled, a total of six or seven times. However, Xu not only refused to fulfill the contract, but often greeted her with closed doors. Later, Xu sent a mediator to resolve the matter, but the amount discussed was too far apart and could not be resolved. Until the day before yesterday (the 24th), Chen, because this matter had been delayed for a long time and Xu still ignored it, and because Chen was facing financial difficulties and had pawned all her clothes and ornaments, had no choice but to go to Xu's house with her mother, He, and her grandmother, Zheng, that morning to ask for money. When Chen entered the door, she was immediately met by the gatekeeper, who was fierce and grabbed Chen's mother, beat her, and blew a whistle to summon Chinese and Western police officers, who brought Chen, her mother, and her grandmother to the police station. The police chief questioned the gatekeeper, and the gatekeeper admitted that his master had ordered him to beat them. After the police chief questioned them briefly, he dismissed them. Chen had no choice but to support her mother and hire a car to go home. Chen felt that Xu's actions were too deceptive and was determined to hire a lawyer to file a criminal injury lawsuit with the court.</p>

<h3 id="e177">A Young Woman Hanged Herself, or Was She Strangled by Her Husband? <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>The Court Autopsied and Determined that She Died by Hanging Herself, but Her Mother and Brother Insisted that She Was Strangled by Her Husband</p>
<p>The Landlord Stated that the Couple Often Argued</p>
<p>Wang Rongkun, the second son of Wang Fuda, the owner of Wang Taifeng Department Store at the intersection of Guangdong Road and Fujian Road, Changzhou native, is currently working in the insurance department of the British-owned Willie Yang Company, and is only 23 years old. In October of the year before last, he married the daughter Quanfeng of Fang Xushi, a fellow villager, through a matchmaker, and rented a pavilion room above the Xiangtaichang Clothing Store at No. 602, Dongyouheng Road. On the night of the 6th of this month, Quanfeng suddenly hanged herself. Rongkun reported it to the police station in charge, who carried the body to the autopsy room on Feilun Road. The next morning, they transferred it to the First Special District Local Court, and the prosecutor of Wancheng Hall and the forensic doctor went to the room to examine it. It was determined that she had committed suicide by hanging herself. An order was issued to the deceased's husband, Wang Rongkun, to sign a guarantee to claim the body and coffin for burial. Now, the deceased's mother, Fang Xushi, and brother, Fang Xianggen, have jointly hired a lawyer to file a criminal lawsuit against Wang Rongkun in the First Special Court, saying that Quanfeng did not hang herself, but was actually strangled to death, requesting that he be punished for murder under Article 284, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Code. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Xiao Xiefei opened a court hearing. The plaintiffs, Fang Xushi and her son, appeared in court and stated separately that about two weeks before Quanfeng's death, they suddenly received a letter from Rongkun saying that Quanfeng was critically ill, so Fang Xushi rushed over from her hometown. However, after arriving in Shanghai, she saw that Quanfeng was not sick, and that Rongkun should not have done this. However, the letter has now been lost. As for the incident, Xianggen did not arrive at the scene of the autopsy because he returned to his hometown to call his mother. Judge Xiao then said to the plaintiffs, "According to the autopsy by the prosecutor and forensic doctor, it was determined that she died by hanging herself, and only her left leg and foot had slight injuries. Now you claim in your lawsuit that there were fingernail marks on her neck and bruises on her waist, and that she was strangled to death. This judge has already asked the forensic doctor who performed the autopsy in detail, and they all said that they examined it very carefully at the time, and that there was no such phenomenon at all. Prosecutors, forensic doctors, and scribes are all civil servants, and their examinations are extremely accurate and fair. You only say that she was strangled to death, which is hardly credible. So, what evidence do you have?" The plaintiff, upon hearing this, still had no concrete answer, and only said that the second landlord had also witnessed it. Therefore, the second landlord, Luo Shurong, was summoned for questioning. According to his statement, "I am related to both parties in this case. The defendant Wang Rongkun and his wife moved into the pavilion room upstairs in April.</p>
<p>They often argue. On September 6th, at 7 p.m., Rongkun returned home and went upstairs, and a quarrel started immediately. I heard the man and woman cursing each other very loudly. There were no other sounds besides that. After a long time, it was silent. At 8:45 p.m., I heard the sound of the second landlord calling. I went upstairs and saw the deceased lying on the cement floor, her hands and feet were cold and she had no breath. I performed first aid. I started to find that there was a belt around her neck. At the knot, one end was four inches long and the other end was more than a foot long. Rongkun was squatting on the bed wearing pants. He got out of bed to untie the belt when he heard me speak. Four days before the incident, Rongkun kicked his wife in the butt because she was watching gambling 麻雀 and did not go upstairs." When questioned, the defendant Wang Rongkun testified, "I have been married to Quanfeng for three years and have never had a quarrel. Only on the night of September 2nd, I quarreled with her because she was watching gambling, but I did not kick her. I don't know how the injuries to her left leg and foot were caused. On September 6th, I returned to my apartment at 7 p.m. and had dinner at 8 p.m. There was no quarrel. Then I went to sleep. At 9:30 p.m., I woke up and my wife was not in bed. I turned on the light and saw that she was</p>
<p>lying on the ground. Because my hand has been ill for some time, I had no strength to support her, so I called out to the housemates, about five or six people, who all heard the sound and entered the room and lifted her onto the bed. I then saw that there was a silk belt around her neck. This belt originally belonged to me, but because I didn't wear it, I placed it on the bed, which caused her to take it and hang herself from the vertical top of the iron bed. Later, because the belt broke, she fell to the ground." The plaintiff's lawyer then requested that the coffin be reopened for re-examination and that the defendant be released on bail. The defendant's lawyer then requested that additional witnesses be summoned. The court then ordered the defendant to pay 500 yuan bail and rescheduled the hearing for the afternoon of October 6th.</p>

<p>Bian Shou'an from Yangzhou, 49 years old, operates a brothel at 4 Shengji Lane, Chujia Bridge, in the French Concession, with five or six prostitutes. The business is quite prosperous. Chen Songfu, a young man from Changzhou residing at 85 Qianjiatang, French Concession, 20 years old, is a frequent patron of Bian's brothel. At 0:30 AM on the 24th, Chen and five friends went to prostitute Cai Bao's room at Bian's house to "have tea" (as they call sitting in a room). They played around for about an hour and left after paying four yuan. For unknown reasons, Chen and his companions became displeased. About five minutes after leaving, they returned to Bian's house, each armed with an iron ruler. Without inquiring, they assaulted everyone they encountered and destroyed everything in sight. When Bian came out to reason with them, he was beaten so severely that his head was broken, and blood flowed profusely. By the time the police arrived, the assailants had already fled. Only Chen was apprehended and taken to the Xiafei Road police station. After questioning by the police chief, Chen was ordered to be detained. The police also sent Bian to the hospital, where doctors bandaged him up before sending him home to recover. Yesterday afternoon, the police escorted Chen to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special District. According to the police lawyer Yuan Jiahwang's statement of the case, he was charged under Article 294 of the Criminal Code. He also stated that the police still needed to investigate the case and arrest the accomplices at large, requesting that the defendant be temporarily detained and the matter investigated and questioned again at a later date. Following this, the victim, Bian Shou'an, recounted the experience of being assaulted. Judge Xiong Huicui verified the confession and ordered the defendant to be remanded in custody for another hearing on the 30th.

<p>Zhang Cai, a woman from Yangzhou, 45 years old, and her husband Zhang Yunsheng, who works as a laborer on ships, lived together at 156 Rulianwan Road. However, Zhang's wages were very meager, leading to constant economic hardship. Because of this, Mrs. Zhang felt resentful after contemplating her situation the day before, and a pessimistic thought emerged. Alone in the bedroom, she found a rope and hanged herself from the beam. Later, her neighbor, Wang Shaodi, caught a glimpse of the scene and was horrified. She immediately called for several men, who managed to bring her down, but it was too late to save her. She had already died. After investigation by the police, they immediately reported to the Yulin Road police station, who dispatched detectives to investigate. The body was then taken to the Fielun Road mortuary. Yesterday morning, Prosecutor Guo Wei from the First Special District Local Court arrived at the mortuary to examine the body. After taking a statement from Wang Shaodi, Mr. Guo pronounced that the deceased, Zhang Cai, had indeed died by hanging herself. The body was handed over to her husband, Zhang Yunsheng, who signed a guarantee to take it back for burial.</p>

Yesterday morning, Ding Laowu and others were escorted to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District. Judge Wu Zehan presided over the hearing. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin stated that the defendants had conspired with others on the morning of the 8th of this month to commit armed robbery at the Yitai Money Exchange at 997 Broadway Road, stealing 170 yuan in cash, which they divided and spent. Although Wang Xiaoerzi did not participate in this robbery, he was involved in another robbery on Jiaxing Road and should be detained. He requested that the court issue a writ to the Public Security Bureau to transfer Wang Huang for a joint trial. Defendant Ding Laowu confessed that he was invited to participate in the robbery by Zhou Xingfu, and that the pistol was held by a "small nose" (Zhang Xiaosanzi), who was still at large. He stated that the gun and bullets found at Wang Huang's house belonged to Ma Pi Zhao Jisheng. They used ninety yuan from the Broadway Road robbery to buy a pistol and thirty bullets, which were stored at Wang's house for future robberies.

The Yuxing Company's plot to kill peddlers is one matter, and the discovery of theft on the Jufeng Company's Baofeng Wheel by the Provincial Public Security Team on the water is another matter. One occurred before May, and the other was discovered within ten days. The facts are clear and cannot be confused. However, the association did not know about the theft beforehand and let it run rampant. After the Xin Renhe plot to kill five peddlers caused an uproar at home and abroad, they repeatedly and tirelessly added the theft cases that occurred afterward to the five peddlers who unjustly drowned at the bottom of the sea, so that their wronged souls in the afterlife still bear an unclean name. Our association is as concerned about the safety of passengers as you are about suppressing theft. We have already applied to the authorities to handle the matter strictly according to the law. However, for the sake of maintaining humanity, we will never allow the arbitrary framing of innocent people, so that timid and isolated travelers are given a bad name by those who plot to kill for money, which would allow the murderers to escape the law. Moreover, the victims are clearly five people, but the association suddenly claims four, as if another person on the Xin Renhe Wheel committed theft and drowned themselves, so that the company would not be responsible, and the defendants convicted by the court would not be subject to legal sanctions at all. In order to uphold justice and prevent confusion, this association hereby sends this letter, hoping that your newspaper will correct it. Furthermore, this case has lasted for five months, and the eighteen elderly and young victims are dressed in rags and live like beggars. As the weather is gradually getting colder, our association is unable to provide assistance beyond food and lodging. When the Xin Renhe resumed its voyages, the victims privately demanded clothing and food from the company. After being notified by the authorities, our association feared that there would be excesses, so we sent staff in a special car to stop them, waiting for a legal resolution. However, your newspaper's report on the disturbance when the Xin Renhe resumed its voyages stated that "upon careful observation, their appearance was no longer that of the plaintiffs who stood in court the other day," which is also untrue. We respectfully request that this be corrected as well, to clarify the truth and prevent expectations from being dashed. Sincerely, The Xin Renhe Steamboat Tragedy Relief Association, September 10, addressed to the chief editor of the Shen Bao.</p>

<h3 id="e222">Regulations for Reviewing Student Status in Secondary Schools <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>Notice from the Municipal Education Bureau on Key Points</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau issued a notice yesterday to all secondary schools in the city stating that the regulations for reviewing the student status of new and transfer students admitted each semester by the schools have been revised and ordered to be followed since the last semester. As this semester has already begun, the previously issued regulations should still be followed. However, to further improve administrative efficiency, the following changes and points of attention are listed separately: (1) Except for transfer students in the second grade or above, whose credentials must be verified, the graduation certificates (or certificates of completion) of all first-year students in senior and junior high schools need not be verified. Instead, the documents can be directly submitted to the bureau for review to save time. (2) In the replies from various schools verifying credentials last semester, some used formal reports while others used letters, which made the review process cumbersome and prone to omissions. In the future, all replies should be submitted as formal reports to facilitate the review process. (3) The newly issued regulations for reviewing student status last semester stipulated that the credentials of transfer students from other locations should be sent directly to the original school's highest educational administrative organ for verification. However, some schools failed to comply strictly, directly sending inquiries to the students' original schools, which was not in accordance with the procedures. This should be strictly observed in the future, and the regulations should be followed to avoid errors. To facilitate the verification of credentials for transfer students from other locations, a separate list of the highest educational administrative organs in various provinces and cities is provided below for your attention. (4) All official documents for verifying credentials should clearly state the details, such as "Student 000, admitted to the 0th grade of senior or junior high school, 0th semester, in the 0th academic year of this school," to facilitate verification by the relevant authorities. (5) The last paragraph of Article 6 of the newly revised regulations for reviewing student status in the last semester stated that "For students transferring from other schools in this city, a student status form should be filled out and submitted to the bureau for record, and there is no need to fill out a student status card." Now, the student status form is being issued, and you are required to follow this procedure and submit it together with the graduation certificates of new students and the student status cards of new students and transfer students from other locations to the bureau before October 10th without delay. (6) All credentials that need to be verified must be sent out for verification no later than October 15th without any delay. You are required to comply with these instructions separately.</p>
<p>Attached is a list of the highest educational administrative organs in various provinces and cities:</p>
<p>(1) The following are provincial education departments: Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan, Guizhou, Hunan, Hubei, Anhui, Fujian, Jiangxi, Shandong, Shanxi, Henan, Hebei, Shaanxi, Sichuan, Gansu, Xinjiang, Ningxia, Qinghai, Suiyuan, Chahar, Xikang.

<h3 id="e224">Introducing Xu Siyuan's New Book <a href="#e224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>"Human Nature and the Destiny of Man"</p>
<p>The philosophical writings of Chinese scholar Xu Siyuan have been circulating overseas and have long been highly regarded by prominent figures in the contemporary intellectual world. For example, the great philosopher Santayana said that the author possesses a special talent in inner analysis, and the great Eastern poet Tagore said that the author's writings have profound wisdom, enough to enlighten many readers to understand the true meaning of life. In recent years, the author has written a book based on his personal experiences of life, published in English, entitled On The Nature and Destiny of Man. According to the author's preface, the book's content draws heavily from the teachings of Western philosophers Plato, Kant, and Nietzsche, and remotely coincides with the doctrines of the Confucian school before the Qin Dynasty. After publication, first-class scholars abroad who read the book expressed great admiration, which is a rare honor in China's intellectual world. Excerpts from various reviews are translated below: (1) German writer Thomas Mann (Nobel Prize winner in 1929): "The publication of this book will surely make the author's intellectual genius noticed by the world." (2) German philosopher Driesch: "This book gave me great interest and inspiration. The author's analysis of the ethical theories of Kant and Schopenhauer is simply amazing. I agree with every point." (3) Austrian poet and writer Van Fowler: "From this book, I have come to know the philosophy of the soul, the philosophy of life, and especially the philosophy of the artist, which is by no means a set of dry and tasteless theories. In short, it is a philosophy that can melt the intellectual products of Europe over the past centuries with the ancient Eastern wisdom." (4) British Poet Laureate Masefield: "I read this book with great interest and admiration, and I am confident that this book will transmit the light of wisdom to millions of readers." (5) British playwright (president of the Drama Association) Bax: "I am largely sympathetic to the thoughts expressed in the solemn and quiet words of this book. In this era, it is truly heartening to find an author who is more concerned with the permanent problems of humanity than with the noisy disputes of politics and economics." (6) British biologist and philosopher (one of the founders of evolution) Morgan: "It is very pleasing and valuable to read this book in old age." (7) Irish poet Shaw: "Concise and clear, very sufficient to express the author's ideals." (8) French writer Gide: "Reading this book in the midst of illness, depression, and loneliness, my spirits were immediately refreshed." (9) American philosopher and writer Santayana: "This book is full of reason and elegant sentiments, enough to imagine the cultural origins of ancient countries. Even the concepts adopted by the author from the West, such as the concept of 'pure love,' seem to be able to blend with their own ideas without separation." It is heard that the sales agents for this book are Shanghai Kaiming Bookstore and Nanjing Zhongshan Bookstore.</p>

<p>Foreign Money Markets See Slight Increase… Discounts Also at Three Cents</p>
<p>The financial sector showed a sluggish trend again last week, but the abundance of bank collections and distributions early this week suggests a potential for renewed activity. However, with the financial markets dried up, those in control of finances remain unwilling to supply fully, hindering any prospect of relaxation in the market. Although it is currently the peak season for autumn goods, the inability to circulate funds freely hinders trade. The market atmosphere yesterday appeared lively on the surface but remained trapped in a dry state. Consequently, the foreign money market saw no major fluctuations, with both morning and afternoon rates at five cents, a slight improvement of two cents from the previous day. Discounts added water at three to four cents. In the discounted bills market, over 4.8 million yuan was transferred in the morning session, with over 1.1 million yuan in new transactions. The afternoon session saw over 300,000 yuan, and the small clearing house saw over 600,000 yuan. In terms of bank collections and distributions, foreign banks collected and distributed over 2.56 million yuan in bills and over 3.78 million yuan in foreign currency. Special collections and distributions amounted to over 3.45 million yuan. Various goods, exchange rates, mortgages, and miscellaneous collections and distributions amounted to over 5.3 million yuan in domestic currency and over 6.4 million yuan in foreign currency. Deliveries from warehouses amounted to 400,000 yuan in domestic currency and 700,000 yuan in foreign currency. Chinese banks collected and distributed over 3.9 million yuan in bills. Special collections and distributions in foreign currency also amounted to over 3.9 million yuan. Various goods, tax, mortgage, and miscellaneous collections and distributions amounted to 6.56 million yuan. Deliveries into warehouses amounted to 600,000 yuan. Japanese banks deposited 500,000 yuan into warehouses and withdrew 800,000 yuan in foreign currency from warehouses. Due to the 25th day being the deadline, private money houses' foreign currency public orders for collection and distribution appeared slightly higher than usual, totaling over 43 million yuan. There were not many collections and distributions for foreign currency discounts, only 7.5 million yuan, which was several million less than at the beginning of last week. Inward remittances from various routes amounted to over 800,000 yuan, and cash collections amounted to 780,000 yuan. New foreign currency mortgage transactions totaled over 700,000 yuan, and redemptions totaled over 1.3 million yuan, for a total of over 2 million yuan. Banknote collections and issuances totaled 2.56 million yuan. The sources for various routes included 100,000 yuan each in banknotes and cash, 250,000 yuan in new currency withdrawals, and 100,000 yuan in banknotes. Also, the total number of exchanges at the city's clearing house on the 25th was 7,055,539.83 yuan, including 3,055,374.34 yuan in silver dollars and 3,805,165.49 yuan in exchange remittances in silver dollars.</p>
<h3 id="e229">Copper Coins Decrease Slightly, Angular Coins Remain Stable <a href="#e229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>Due to more buying than selling in the copper coin market in recent days, the circulating inventory is small, with no room for maneuvering. Therefore, the market price is gradually decreasing. In a week, it has decreased by as much as 4,000 to 5,000, with yesterday showing a decrease of another 500 coins, resulting in a low price of 310,500 coins, a new low for this month. A total of 35,397 strings of transactions were made, for a total price of 11,400 yuan in foreign currency. Jiangnan small foreign currency was at 834.50 yuan in the morning and 834.70 yuan in the afternoon, a difference of 20 cents between the two sessions, showing a slight fluctuation. A total of 9,000 angular coins were transacted in the morning session and 7,500 angular coins in the afternoon session.

<p>National News Agency, London, 25th dispatch: The recent major strip decreased by 0625, totaling 18 pence and 4375. The distant rate remained unchanged, still at 18 pence and 9375. The British-American exchange rate opened at 4 yuan, 71 cent and 25 points.</p>
<h3 id="e231">Sudden Decline in Securities and Public Bonds <a href="#e231" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c231" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">231</a></h3>
<p>Northern Gangs Sell Short, Bulls Exit</p>
<p>Various Bonds Decline, The Later, the More Severe</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Securities Exchange market suddenly experienced a sharp decline due to the serious situation in North China and numerous rumors. Short sellers and bulls exited the market, creating a sudden sense of tension. During the morning opening, Northern gangs sold vigorously, mostly shorting distant contracts, while bulls exited recent contracts. Disbandment distant contracts declined by 85 cents, while recent salt tax contracts declined by only 25 cents. This was because there were many short sellers in salt tax, so they compensated when the price fell slightly. In the second session, numbers 21 and 46 were also sold off, but those covering short positions were also quite strong, showing a struggle to rebound. However, due to the large number of sellers, the price failed to stabilize and continued to decline by about 12 cents. During the afternoon opening, there was confirmation that the "96 Reorganization" rumor was false, causing a sudden decline of about half a yuan. The other variables showed no signs of recovery and continued to decline by 5 to 23 cents. At the closing, the decline had not subsided. The aforementioned varieties continued to decline by 23 cents, with the trend weakening the later it went. Unified tax fell by 35 cents, and the salt tax fell especially sharply, plummeting by 70 to 90 cents. It was rumored that the news from the front lines was bad, and the market participants were hesitant to buy, causing the decline to accelerate. The final result was a uniform decline, ranging from 40 cents to 1.60 yuan. Among them, the entire 6 fell the most, at 1.60 yuan, followed by the 96, falling by 1.30 yuan to 1.60 yuan, and the salt tax falling by 1.15 yuan to 1.55 yuan. There is only one day left for this month's futures, and the market price changes will undoubtedly be substantial. The total transaction volume was 18,446,000 yuan, including 6,000 yuan in spot goods and 6,230,000 yuan in combined futures for unified salt tax. Disbandment accounted for 1,960,000 yuan, 19 customs duties for 1,900,000 yuan, 20 volumes and 20 customs duties for 3,315,000 yuan, 96 accounted for 2,225,000 yuan, the gold short and entire 6 totaled 1,163,000 yuan, and the rest ranged from tens of thousands to over 1.4 million.</p>

<p>Xinfeng Foreign Company reported that the New York stock market on the 24th was in good condition due to strong goods, especially cotton, which rose to 3.60 yuan per bale, rising by 5 points. There were many speculators, so transactions were not smooth, but there should be no unexpected bad news. Further uncertain recovery is expected next week. The total number of transactions for the day was 1,000,000 shares. The cotton market rose because of reports that the U.S. President would have large plans to increase cotton prices and suppress inflation, that is, the government would give farmers public bonds worth one dime per pound of cotton if farmers could comply with the government's plan to reduce cotton production for two years. If this plan can be implemented, the effect may make the cotton market look better and better. Wheat opened very vigorously, and then news of Washington bulls settling past positions caused it to continue to rise, and buying was very profitable. Silver prices opened very firmly, and then fell at the close due to speculative trading. The Dow Jones index is listed below.</p>

<p>The gauze market has turned downward again, with a slight decline appearing. Reports indicate that the situation in North China is gradually becoming serious, with attempts to disturb Tianjin and Tanggu, causing people's hearts to be disheartened. Therefore, the market has declined, and short sellers are scrambling to sell. However, a certain yarn factory is still absorbing large quantities, and the number of package deals is increasing. As a result, the market has been slightly tightened. However, the surrounding environment is deteriorating, and the prices of all commodities are declining, so it is difficult for the gauze market to rise significantly.</p>
<p>Human Standard Reveals Weakness Again. The pre-market opening for Human Standard showed a sluggish atmosphere, with a slight selling trend. However, major players continued to buy, but the downward trend was still difficult to reverse. Prices for various months fell by six, eight, nine cents to one dollar and ten cents. In the afternoon, bulls continued to buy and increase their positions, rising by one, two, and three cents. The total transaction volume for the day was 46,200 packages. The sales were: Tongfu 1,700 packages, Dafeng 1,800 packages, Zhenda 900 packages, Taixing 2,150 packages, Xiesheng 1,300 packages, and Guangfeng 900 packages. The purchases were: Rongxing 3,650 packages, Dada 1,050 packages, Senkang 1,450 packages, and Yihe 1,850 packages. The closing prices are listed below:</p>
<p>Human Standard Closing Prices (Rise/Fall)  Inventory Count  December 186 (Fall 9)   63,800 September 1818 (Fall 3)  25,450 January 1866 (Fall 7)   73,350 October 1833 (Fall 5)  63,000 February 1873 (Fall 6)   39,400 November 1846 (Fall 9)   73,300 Total   338,350</p>
<p>Gauze Sales Strong at 1,000 Packages. The amount of spot gauze purchased by various gangs today was higher than yesterday. The total for the day was 1,045 packages, with market conditions similar to the previous day. The purchase amounts for each gang are listed below: Yunnan 0, Nanjing 5, Guangdong , Ningbo 5, Wuhu , Suzhou 15, Inland 140, Shantou 85, Changsha 64, Sichuan 53, Fellow Traders 15.</p>
<h3 id="e234">Continuous Autumn Rains Damage Cotton Bolls; Buying Activity in Standard Cotton Flowers is Particularly Strong <a href="#e234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>Cotton prices are trending firmer due to continuous rains for three days, coupled with a rise in imported cotton. According to a partial survey, it is currently the peak period for cotton boll opening, but continuous cloudy and humid weather may damage the cotton bolls. As a result, buyers are very active. The Ningbo gang's supply is reduced due to cloudy weather. Another theory is that the Ningbo Hefeng Yarn Factory is said to be resuming operations. Therefore, the gang has been heavily shorting in recent months, with approximately 20,000 dan or more. The market has been stimulated and prices have risen, but the future lacks certainty.</p>
<p>Zheng Standard Trending Slightly Higher. The pre-market opening for Zheng Standard saw prices for various months rise by two or three cents due to adverse weather. Later, although U.S. cotton rose, gold prices fell, and the Japanese cotton market was sluggish, the market declined. As a result, the current month rose by five to ten cents, and the distant months fell by five to ten cents. In the afternoon, short sellers covered their positions, and the weather still showed no signs of clearing up. Prices for various months rose by one or two cents again. The total transaction volume for the day was 113,300 dan. The sales were: Xincheng 5,200 dan, Chunji 3,800 dan, Taichang 2,100 dan, Hengfeng 2,700 dan, Guangfeng 4,100 dan, and Mingde 2,300 dan. The purchases were: Shenchang 5,600 dan, Deji 3,400 dan, Yuanxingchang 8,400 dan, and Yifeng 2,400 dan, Yuanda 2,200 dan. The closing prices are as follows:</p>

However, retail demand was slightly weaker, but overall, the limited arrivals strengthened people's confidence. There were a total of over one thousand packages available.

According to statistics, the prices of various types of thick japonica and aged/new Duyang pointed rice rose slightly by several cents. South Port thick rice jumped by 20-30 cents due to a lack of goods. Various types of thin rice rose by more than a foot. Shady Yuan also rose by more than 10 cents.

<p>After the opening of the flour market this morning, prices for various months initially showed a flat trend, followed by a decline. Due to the quoted price of imported wheat, Chicago rebounded by 90 cents, and Canada rose by around 20 cents. Therefore, the market atmosphere was still stable at the time of opening. Later, due to actual sales returning and fears arising from the situation in Tianjin and Tanggu, the quoted price of Tianjin flour fell by two cents. As a result, the sentiment of both near and distant months was unfavorable, and selling pressure gradually increased. When the market opened in the afternoon, rumors were rampant, claiming that communist bandits had infiltrated the Zhejiang border and that martial law had been declared in Zhejiang. Major factories also slightly reduced their offerings, causing people's hearts to become extremely weak. Given the accumulation of spot goods in the current month, if speculative buying is not strong, the future may see a significant decline. As a result, the current month fell by 1.5 cents compared to the previous week, October fell by 1.75 cents, November fell by 2 cents, and December and January fell by 1.5 cents, and February fell by 1.75 cents.</p>
<p>After the wheat market opened this morning, prices for various months initially showed a brisk trend, followed by a decline. Due to the quoted price of imported wheat, there was a rebound of around 90 cents or 20 cents. Therefore, after opening, the current month opened at 90 cents, and the distant months were also better by 1-2 cents. After entering, the market became flat and tired due to the lack of buyers and the decline in the flour market. Prices for various months fell by 2-3 cents or more. When the market opened in the afternoon, the market uniformly softened due to the continued small decline in the flour market and the widespread dissemination of rumors about the situation. As a result, people were panicked and frequently sold. As a result of closing, the current month fell by 4 cents, October fell by 3 cents, November fell by 5 cents, December fell by 6 cents, January fell by 7 cents, and February fell by 5 cents. The spot wheat market is slightly weak, and prices are stable. Hankou wheat opened at 3.475 yuan, followed by 4.2 yuan. Qintong wheat was 3.875 yuan, with a total of over 4,300 packages, purchased by Shenda and Fufeng Xinda.</p>
<h3 id="e237">New Guest Indica and Fujian Demand Increasing <a href="#e237" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c237" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">237</a></h3>
<p>| Central Customs Rice Generally Increasing |</p>
<p>Yesterday, the demand for Guest Indica from Fujian Province became even stronger. In addition to Fuzhou and Quanzhou, Xiamen also newly emerged as a brisk buyer. Fuzhou was particularly eager. The Ningbo gang paid attention to foreign rice, only dealing with 300 packages of Kunshan Guan pointed rice. After the Yong gang's continuous brisk buying of foreign brown rice and small twisted grains, their appetite was temporarily satisfied and they needed to slow down before buying again. Due to the urgent local demand in Fujian Province, the foreign rice that used to be transshipped from Hong Kong and Guangdong could not be as convenient as in the past due to tax disputes. Therefore, the demand for Indica rice in this city was getting better. The market was originally looking soft due to the Ningbo gang stopping buying yesterday, but it stood up again as it was being bought briskly by various gangs from Fujian. The Central Customs goods were generally increasing, and special high-quality goods could also be sold at a good price. It was estimated that 320 packages of new Jiangxi machine early rice were sold at a price of 6.7 yuan, 120 packages of Hunan machine Jing rice were sold at a price of 7.3 yuan, 343 packages of Yan rice were sold at a price of 6.7 yuan, 948 packages of brown rice were sold at a price of 5.9 yuan, 3,500 packages of Beijing factory Indica rice were sold at a price of 7.1 yuan, 1,000 packages of Che Indica rice were sold at a price of 7 yuan, 278 packages of brown rice were sold at a price of 6.2 yuan, 110 packages of Xi Indica rice were sold at a price of 7.3 yuan, and Kunshan Yang pointed rice opened at 6.66 yuan, with medium and lower qualities priced separately. The later trend still looked stable.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the Zhenjiang gang transported ten packages of new Yantai peanuts, ten packages of Yantai peanut kernels, and twenty-two packages of Qingdao peanut kernels. It is said that this year's yield and its products are better than last year's. However, the body color is still soft due to the new goods relationship. The batch was distributed by this street the same day. Peanuts opened at 8.8 yuan, and peanut kernels were priced at 12 yuan. According to industry insiders, the selling price of the second batch may be difficult to emulate at this price.</p>
<h3 id="e239">Sugar Market: Raw Sugar and White Sugar Become Tired with the Customs Gold <a href="#e239" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c239" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">239</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market suddenly became tired as the Customs Gold fell slightly. The guild set the price of ordinary No. 24 raw sugar and white sugar at 21.8 yuan, but there were few buyers. The price of new Dutch red MKG plus A mark sugar was 16.8 yuan, and the price of old goods was 16.5 yuan, but no deals were made. Taikoo sugar B mark was 21.7 yuan, down five cents. CW mark was 21.55 yuan, down ten cents. DY mark had no goods. HX mark was 20.85 yuan. The top grade of the factory's own cotton white sugar, China Guohua, opened at 20.9 yuan, No. 1 at 20.7 yuan, No. 2 at 20.5 yuan, No. 3 at 20.3 yuan, and No. 4 at 20.1 yuan. Zhenji No. 1 was 20.7 yuan, down five cents from before. Nos. 2, 3, 4, and 5 were priced according to the discount. China's own rock sugar, No. 1 was 24.1 yuan, No. 2 was 23.9 yuan, and No. 3 was 23.1 yuan. Crystal Yong was 25.6 yuan. The Chao gang opened up over 200 packages of Chaoqing, with higher ones at 15.7 yuan, followed by 15.15 yuan, and then 14.8 yuan to 7.5 yuan. Zhenxing Ben Cotton White previously offered dozens of packages at 19.5 yuan. Yesterday, they wanted to increase the price, but the firm still held the original price, so no transaction was made.</p>

<h3 id="e240">In the Metropolis <a href="#e240" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c240" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">240</a></h3>
<p>— Shen Yan</p>
<p>In the metropolis (of course, I am not just referring to Shanghai), the dense growth of the population is directly proportional to the collapse of the countryside. The black line on the statistical table always shows a significant rise every six months. However, what exactly are these countless people doing in the metropolis? I feel that it is more accurate to say that they are engaging in hand-to-hand combat rather than settling down and prospering. Therefore, those who intentionally want to occupy a considerable position in the metropolis and share some material enjoyment must have at least the following two skills:</p>
<p>(1) Lack of a Sense of Shame: In the metropolis, the most taboo thing is to be afraid of embarrassment, and the most suitable thing is to be thick-skinned. When necessary, you should not blush even after being slapped in the face. You must put on a smile, a very natural smile, not even a bitter smile. Whether this slap is received in front of one person or in front of a thousand people, as long as the person who gives you the slap can bring you considerable benefits, you must endure it. If you think there is a need for further contact, you may kneel down and recognize him as your godfather, regardless of whether he is older or younger than you. When you encounter a foreign master, after being slapped, although you cannot recognize him as your godfather, you must say a few words of "Yes, Sir!" This way, you can be invincible.</p>
<p>(2) Maximum Westernization: As long as the money in your pocket is willing to help, in the metropolis, the first thing you must do is wear Western-style clothes, and leather shoes are of course indispensable. Even if you don't have enough money, old Western-style clothes and old leather shoes are absolutely necessary. If you like to smoke, it is best to smoke a pipe. When speaking, you must include a foreign word in every three sentences, especially in public places. If you have the opportunity to make a couple of foreign friends (it doesn't have to be British or American, even Portuguese or Russian people are fine, and Japanese people are of course even better), don't miss it. You must spare no expense to curry favor with them. Once he is willing to walk with you on the street, then your face will be greatly enhanced! When walking, when taking a public bus or streetcar, and in the library, don't forget to bring a copy of a foreign newspaper or carry a Western book in the original version, even if you don't understand it. You must pretend to understand it and don't be afraid of your arms getting tired. In short, when a person is in the metropolis, the first priority is to imitate foreigners in everything, whether it is walking, eating, dressing, or going to the toilet... You must try to Westernize as much as possible and be thoroughly Westernized.</p>
<p>Friends, when you are in the metropolis, don't forget to study these two skills, otherwise you are incorrigible!</p>
<h3 id="e241">Achievements <a href="#e241" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c241" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">241</a></h3>
<p>— A Jie</p>
<p>Whether male or female, living in this world, it is nothing more than making some "achievements." Is inventing new principles and new things an achievement? No. Is establishing virtue, establishing words, and establishing merit achievements? No. Is making money, opening a store, and acquiring property achievements? No. What I say is the "achievement" of life, is the crystallization of love, (children).</p>
<p>The Flower Name Treasure Scroll says: "Thirty without children is mediocre, forty without children is lonely, fifty without children is not respected, sixty without children severs kinship. It is really bitter to be without children in old age, like Coptis chinensis, which is extremely bitter." This idea of ​​ancestral succession is deeply imprinted in the minds of our countrymen. In fact, it is all Mencius's fault. He said: "There are three unfilial acts, and having no offspring is the greatest." So today, three wives and four concubines are not uncommon, and rough manufacturing and declining products are common. If there were not this theory, our country's citizens would not be so numerous. The population would not be excessive, unemployment would naturally be reduced, and it would certainly not affect the country's governance. Therefore, to save China, the first step is to stop making "achievements." Speaking of personal suffering, the reason also lies in the indiscriminate making of "achievements." Sniveling Ah Da, scabby Ah Er, mangy Ah San... children surround the knees, and grandchildren fill the hall. People congratulate and say, "What a blessing!" In fact, there is "energy," but it is difficult to say "blessing." Poor people are especially good at finding poor fun and strive to create "achievements." Children cry and women wail, which is exceptionally lively. Living expenses, education expenses, medical expenses... make them complain endlessly. Is this not the retribution for finding too much poor fun?</p>
<p>In the current situation, it is difficult for gentry gentlemen to talk about enjoying the blessings of children, and friends from Jiangbei already know the burdens of children. Economic burdens are the inherent duty of the father, and there is no complaint. As for reputational burdens, we can only use the motto "One mother gives birth to nine children, and the mother has ten hearts" to defend ourselves. With anger in the belly, where can we seek redress? We can only regret that we did not find a proper way to have fun at the time, and we made such unlucky "achievements." It is also useless!</p>
<p>At the exhibition, "achievements" are not useless, especially when you, old man, return to heaven. Obituaries, coffins, and spirit curtains are important times and applications for "achievement" exhibitions. At other times, the effectiveness of "achievements" is very, very small. However, because you, old man, worked diligently during your lifetime, you earned a lot of inheritance. Then, your achievements, A, B, C, and D, will naturally fight each other at that time. Although you want to reach out from the coffin and slap your world brother twice, it will be too late!</p>

<p>When officials swear in, there are three no-ism: no use of personal people, no waste of public funds, and no acceptance of bribes. There are often also three no-ism in military declarations and communiqués: the muzzle is directed outward and not inward, people do not offend me, I do not offend people, and enemies attack, and there is no resistance. Aunts also have three no-ism: they are not allowed to be close to their master and the big woman, they are not allowed to interfere with their physical freedom, and they are not allowed to hinder their romantic life.</p>
<p>Modern youths have three aesthetic principles: love beautiful girls, sensuous curvaceous beauty, and decorative beauty and goodness. Modern girls have three joys: to like lovers in suits and shoes, cars with electric wind, and colorful banknotes. General fashionable young grandmothers have three expenses: expenses for fashionable clothes and cosmetics, expenses for watching movies and playing mahjong, and alimony during divorce.</p>

<p>Chapter 16: Heartbreak When Current, Still Blessings; Military Affairs When Hurry, Army Suddenly Transfers in Secret</p>
<p>When Gan Jizhi's hand pressed on the table, and he was looking outside, there happened to be a rickshaw puller from Haidian who was familiar with him, dragging his rickshaw past the shop entrance. Jizhi suddenly had an idea, immediately raised his head and called out to the outside, "Zhang San." Zhang San stopped and looked inside, saying, "Isn't this Second Master Gan? Where are you making a fortune?" Jizhi paid the bill for the wine and food, walked out, and said to him, "Zhang San, I want to go into the city, can you pull me for a ride?" Zhang San said, "Why not do business? Please get in the car." Jizhi said, "You haven't said how much you want." Zhang San said, "For Third Master's business, there's nothing wrong with saying it. Just send you to the city, and whatever money you give will be enough. I'll take it even if you give me a copper coin." Jizhi listened to him being so polite, so he had no choice but to get in the car without mentioning the price. Zhang San was a person who liked to talk, so he continued to pull the car, panting, and asked, "Second Master, I haven't seen you in a long time, are you making a fortune in the city?" Jizhi smiled and said, "I don't live in the city. And I can't talk about making a fortune." Zhang San said, "Don't you go to the Gan family's house in Haidian?" Jizhi said, "That's my brother's house, I don't go. Are the neighbors still the same as before?" Zhang San said, "There have been some changes. The Li family in the east, their old man died. Wu Laosan, who was next to you, has moved, and now a merchant lives there. The Yang family across from you is still very good. Now a company commander has moved in. Their old girl is now fashionable, and she also talks about freedom. She and that Company Commander Zhao are talking about free love. Haha!" Saying that, he burst out laughing. Jizhi's heart thumped a few times, he calmed down and asked, "What do you mean by free love? I don't understand." Zhang San said, "Don't make me laugh. You don't even understand the four words 'free love'. To put it bluntly, she will marry that Company Commander Zhao of her own accord." (197)</p>
<h3 id="e244">Modern <a href="#e244" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c244" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">244</a></h3>
<p>— Hua Ling</p>
<p>(Modern) Exactly what is "natural justice" is a little difficult to understand. Young ladies spend all day wrapped in clothes, hiding in boudoirs, keeping their delicate faces and slender hands "nourished snow-white," which is said to be "outdated." Women in the tropics spend the year naked and barefoot, except for the front and rear genitalia, without a thread, tanning their whole bodies black, which is said to be "unevolved." Only those who wrap themselves in coats in winter, hiding at home to heat the stove, and those who bare their arms and legs in summer are considered "modern." So, "modern" seems to have some meaning of "both outdated and barbaric."</p>
<p>Speaking only Chinese does not seem beautiful. Speaking only foreign languages seems to be in danger of being a foreign slave and not loving the motherland. If you can mix a sentence or two of foreign language, or mix three or five foreign words, between ten sentences of Chinese, then it is both beautiful and patriotic, and completely "modern." So "modern" seems to have the flavor of "impurity and confusion." Eating "Da Rao Mo" (large steamed buns) and "cornmeal" is for "Shandong villagers," who are only enough to use knives, sticks, sell explanations, and perform magic tricks on the street. Eating "wheat paste" and "wheat porridge" is for "stinky villagers," who are not presentable. But if you buy "oatmeal" or wheat-made "bread" from a catering company and eat it as food, there is no need to say that you are a rare "modern figure" among the yellow race. So "modern" seems to be interpreted as "blind following."</p>
<p>The union of men and women, requiring betrothal gifts and six rites, and formal marriage has been unanimously recognized as "pedantic." Without betrothal gifts and six rites, without matchmakers, men and women who love each other and live together, and who separate when they disagree, are also "vulgar," called "dating." If men and women love each other and practice "cohabitation" that is neither "dating" nor "formally married," that is the most "modern" way. So, "neither awkward nor awkward" seems to be considered "modern."</p>
<p>"Hanging," "swallowing match heads," "swallowing gold," and "taking raw opium" are all well known to be nineteenth-century "suicide policies." This kind of "taking tranquilizer pills" and "jumping into the Huangpu River" has not won people's support for a while. Only suicide by jumping out of a plane is considered a "modern" of autumn, 1933. So the definition of "modern" seems to be able to be said to be "cruel."</p>
<p>"Rare and bizarre" is considered "modern," and "unreasonable" is also "modern," but I finally couldn't find a "natural justice" of "modern."</p>
<h3 id="e245">Hunting Geese <a href="#e245" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c245" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">245</a></h3>
<p>— Cheng Zhaoxiang</p>
<p>The four of us crouched quietly in a small fisherman's hut on the beach of Donggang, waiting for the night tide of the fourteenth night of the lunar August. The waning moon rose at the end of the East China Sea, gray clouds stayed in the sky, the sea surged eastward, the waves roared, and the fine grass beach stretched out under the lonely fisherman's hut. Gan stood up, opened the small door facing the sea beach, looked at the sky, and then paced back impatiently and turned around on the yellow sand floor of the house. Min and Quan talked intermittently about hunting experiences. I sat alone by the door, the moonlight gradually shone into the house, and the sea seemed to have countless silver snakes dancing. We faintly saw distant sailboats as black dots. Everyone waited for the arrival of the tide to hunt the geese that floated in with the tide.</p>
<p>Temporarily forgetting the city's complex thoughts, coming to this lonely seaside is like being an aloof monk, and this light transcends another world! The light sea breeze blew through the reeds, rustling, and a refreshing feeling floated up to my heart.</p>
<p>When the water grass was submerged, leaving only the tops, we knew that the tide had arrived, and we got excited. The four of us divided into two teams. Gan and I were together, hiding under the eaves behind the fisherman's hut. Min and Quan, barefoot and carrying guns and ammunition, left the fisherman's hut and hid in a pile of reeds at the end of the shore, seventy or eighty steps away. Each of us agreed to use lip whistling as a signal. Whoever saw the geese first and was close enough to fire a shot would fire the shot first.</p>
<p>In fact, geese are the most united birds. As long as they hear even a little noise, they will fly away with a whistle! It is not easy to wait for them to come closer again. At first, only one sentry comes to the shore to scout. Only when they have scouted that there is nothing to harm them do they dare to call their kind to float in in groups, but it is rare for them to float close to the shore. The reason why we divided into two teams this time was also because we were afraid that they would not float in and we had prepared a gun hidden outside the shore!</p>
<p>Time passed minute by minute, but the geese did not appear. Gan and I became a little impatient. Crouching in the dark corner of the house, the heavy dew wet our hair, and there was a bit of coldness on our bodies. The tide hit the shore with a whoosh, but we didn't see half a goose. How anxious!</p>
<p>Suddenly, Gan's gaze noticed a large flock of geese flying over on the far sea! Several of them stayed down, but they were far from the shore and did not float in. Damn! At this time, our guns' range definitely could not shoot such distant geese. We had no choice but to endure it, endure it.</p>
<p>We hoped that they would float closer. I thought Min must have seen it, right?</p>
<p>At this moment, we were very anxious, afraid that they would just not come in, wouldn't that be terrible! Just as I was thinking, suddenly three more flew in with a chatter, about forty meters from the shore. Before they could settle down with a splash, there was a crisp sound from the reeds on the other side, reverberating crisply on the empty sea surface, and the echo returned and spread out again. The rest of the geese were suddenly startled and flapped their heavy wings, turned around and flew away, not allowing you any chance to fire more bullets. A wounded goose was spinning in circles on the water.</p>
<p>Gan and I cheered and ran over. Min sat in the reeds, unloading the bullet. Quan asked us, "Now that the goose has been shot, how are we going to get it ashore! The beach water is very deep, who will go down! What should we do?"</p>
<p>Finally, Min agreed to go down. He was not afraid of water. He could swim. It took him a lot of effort to get the goose ashore. Back in the fisherman's hut, we helped him dry his back, put on his night clothes, rested for a while, and left the lonely fisherman's hut. …………</p>
<p>Talking all the way, we were very happy, and the bright moon followed us above our heads. The wind quietly blew through the countryside, maple forest, and dew was cool on our hair and wet and heavy on our clothes. The autumn grass was without sound, without breath, soaked in dew.</p>
<p>The four of us, together with that goose, were on our way in the middle of the night of the fourteenth of August under the bright moon.</p>

<h3 id="e246">On "Female Students" <a href="#e246" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c246" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">246</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Qinwen</p>
<p>Currently, social news in newspapers often carries the term "female students." Calling those who study "students," and female students "female students," seems to present no problem. However, in the past, among the four classes of society—scholars, farmers, artisans, and merchants—only scholars engaged in studying. Therefore, once someone had studied, they could forever be called "students." In places where universal education is practiced, everyone has studied, so the term "student" is limited to those currently studying at school. Otherwise, it would be too broad, like the general term "person." Thus, "female student" should refer to women currently studying at school. However, the reality is different. Newspapers even refer to housewives who have never studied as "female students." A friend told me that his sister-in-law, who cannot recognize a single character, was also called a "female student" by the newspaper. Investigating the reason for this title, it is merely due to her short hair, leather shoes, and long socks. It is clear that this so-called "female student" simply means a young woman with modern attire.</p>
<p>It is said that the reporter who called her a "female student" certainly did not talk to her or inquire about her background. He merely glanced at her from a distance and then started writing the news. This is just one instance, but such cases are not limited to one. It generally reflects the current state of newspapers.</p>
<p>Originally, old women are "female students" of the past, and little girls are "female students" of the future. Simply using the three words "female student" is somewhat inappropriate. News reporters like to use this term, probably to cater to the general reader's psychology. Nowadays, so-called "female students" seem to have two strong legs, can play tennis and volleyball, and even swim in the water. They can sing with pursed lips and dance in fluttering cheongsams. Men who grew up in the environment of old moral teachings of abstinence are often somewhat lecherous. Seeing such "female students," they inevitably feel weak and entranced. However, to recognize someone as a "female student" simply because one sees short hair, leather shoes, and long socks is to be overly sensitive, showing a distance from the real "female students." The wife and mother are undoubtedly women with yellow faces and bound feet.</p>
<h3 id="e247">Reading "A Southern Journey" <a href="#e247" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c247" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">247</a></h3>
<p>— Xiaoxue</p>
<p>"A Southern Journey," in one volume, was written by Sun Jiagan (Yizhai) of Taiyuan, Qing Dynasty, and published by Zhang Mai. According to Zhang's postscript, this is "Duke Wending's most delightful work in his life," which was once "compiled into the 'Essays on Governing the World' by He Gong of Shanhua." However, the "Essays on Governing the World" almost halved the original text, so he feared that this article would be "incomplete." Therefore, he "rewrote and printed" it based on Duke Wending's original manuscript. It contains twenty-nine pages of main text and one page of postscript, with eleven lines per page and twenty-one characters per line. At the beginning, the author first explains his motivation for the southern journey: in the summer of Ji Hai, he took leave due to his mother's illness and returned home. In the autumn, he suffered the loss of his mother. He was unable to repay her boundless kindness, leaving him with lingering grief. Moreover, his wife suddenly passed away, and his young child died prematurely. Unable to sing and play music, he almost lost his sight. His studies met with misfortune, and he was trapped by his circumstances. He wanted to find a place to settle among the mountains and rivers, to avoid perpetual remembrance and sorrow. As the poem says: "I go out on a journey to express my sorrow; this is what it means."</p>
<p>Sun Jiagan's journey was entirely for sightseeing, "to express his sorrow." Therefore, the merit of this travelogue lies in its concise descriptions of scenery. On this southern journey, he passed through many places and traveled a long route. Starting from Beijing, he first toured Shandong. His description of Mount Tai is quite captivating. He writes:</p>
<p>Along the way, I craned my neck to look towards Mount Tai, but there was a light rain. Clouds and mountains were in disarray. Occasionally, I saw high peaks outside the clouds and thought they were it. Before I had traveled even a few miles, there was another taller one. In the afternoon, I saw a peak that was very high, with strange rocks jutting out, surrounded by mist and haze. I thought it must be it. Then the river channel opened to the east, and the mountain shape turned to the north. Looking from afar, there was an even taller one. It turned out that I was coming from the north of Mount Tai. In the morning, I saw its back; in the afternoon, I saw its arm. It was not until Taian Prefecture that I faced it directly. Moreover, it was covered by clouds, so I looked but did not see it.</p>
<p>After touring the important places in Shandong, he continued his journey to Jiangsu. He passed through Yangzhou, Zhenjiang, and visited Tianfang and Jinjiao Mountains, arriving in Suzhou, this earthly paradise. But what impression did he get? In his diary, he writes:</p>
<p>Suzhou controls three rivers, spans five lakes, and connects the sea inside and outside the gates. Goods are piled up like mountains, and people flow like water. The rows of shop signs are as brilliant as clouds and brocade. Speaking of its prosperity, it is not far from the capital. However, the customs are frivolous, and people boast and deceive. All artisans and commoners exhaust their wisdom and energy to create strange techniques and licentious crafts, which are said to be doing what is useless to harm what is useful.</p>
<p>Suzhou did not give him a good impression. So, after visiting the scenic spots of Taihu Lake, he "went south out of Wujiang and arrived between Jiuhang in eastern Zhejiang." He was satisfied with this area, and his impression was completely opposite to what he got in Suzhou.</p>
<p>The people are good at sericulture, and the land is planted with mulberry trees. Each household has a pond for raising fish, and each village has a canal for boats. Wheat and rice are lush, growing under the mulberry trees. Quiet girls carry baskets, and children dry nets. The scenery is clear and serene, different from the prosperity of the three Wu regions.</p>
<p>Why was he dissatisfied with Suzhou but felt satisfied in such an environment? It is easy to see in these two contrasting descriptions that it is due to the author's thoughts and his strong pastoral poetic sentiment. From there, he went to Hangzhou and enjoyed himself on the West Lake, then continued to Quzhou. I think the description of the scenery in this area is much better than the depiction of the life on the lake. He writes:</p>
<p>From Hangzhou, I went upstream along the Zhejiang River to Fuyang. The mountains of Fuyang are as majestic as the fortresses of Yan and Qin, but they are greener. South of Fuyang, the river channel gradually narrows, with two mountains facing each other, and a river flowing in the middle. The peaks are reflected upside down, and everything above and below is green. Leaving Tongzi Pass, the scenery gradually opens up. Mountains are arranged in the distance, all beautiful and charming. Mount Tongjun stands steeply on the riverbank, with a flat plain opening up to its south. The stone walls surround it like a natural city, which is Tonglu. Blocking the mountains and facing the water, the residents live among the mountains and rivers. The green tiles and white walls are spotless. Its clearness and brightness are fascinating.</p>
<p>After passing through Zhejiang, he went to Jiangxi, from Jiangxi to Hunan, and then to Guangdong. Later, he returned from Guangdong to Hunan and took the road to Henan towards Beijing. According to the author himself, this southern journey "covered three of the four seas, traveled through seven of the nine provinces, saw four of the five sacred mountains, and witnessed the entirety of the four great rivers." In an era when transportation was inconvenient, it can be said to be a grand tour. He said:</p>
<p>I left the capital in February, when the grass sprouts in Hebei had not yet grown. When I arrived in Wu, the flowers were blooming; when I arrived in Yue, the flowers had fallen. When I entered Chu, rice seedlings were being planted; when I arrived in Yue, rice was being eaten. Returning from western Yue, the autumn was old, and the sky was high. When I arrived in Henan, the leaves had all fallen, and when I returned to Shanxi, rain and snow covered the ground. In the blink of an eye, the four seasons circled around.</p>
<p>This travelogue is quite good at describing scenery. However, the argumentative parts of the article reveal a moralistic tone of conservative Confucianism everywhere, which is unpleasant. While on the boat and having nothing to do, I read this to pass the time. Writing this note under the lamp is truly a case of being idle and helpless.</p>
<h3 id="e248">On Autumn Creek <a href="#e248" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c248" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">248</a></h3>
<p>— Shi Fei</p>
<p>Where to find autumn? Only in the depths of the reeds on the clear creek... There, the footprints of autumn are always deeply engraved year after year.</p>
<p>On a certain night, the scenery on the creek is even more lovely... The wind is still, and the waves are calm, like glass that has just been wiped with velvet. The twinkling stars, the glistening moon, and the lines of flying geese imprint their shadows on the water. A gentle breeze blows, and the glassy surface wrinkles, turning into shimmering ripples. The reeds on both banks, wearing silvery-white flowers, sway in the wind, like a decrepit old man, standing alone in the vastness, nodding his white, disheveled head, appreciating the autumn colors. The half-dried reed leaves knock against each other, making a soft rustling sound, like the intimate whispers of lovers. At this time, a poet walks out of his ivory tower and strolls to this autumn creek. He intends to use inspiration to capture the scenery here and enrich his harvest of poetry.</p>
<p>He seizes the whispers of the reeds, locks in the ripples of the clear creek, cages the radiance of the stars and moon, and stops the flying geese in the long sky... placing them one by one into his poems. Thus, the poems, from the first line to the last, are filled with the sounds and moods of autumn. He thinks that the scenery on the autumn creek has all been captured in his net... Carefully holding his poems, he turns to leave, disdaining to glance at the creek again.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a single oar stroke is heard. The poet involuntarily looks back and sees a small boat rowing from the depths of the creek. The blue water laps against the hull, the cold moon shines on the oar, and the fisherman, who has just been awakened by the flying geese and is sitting on the bow, still has reed catkins clinging to his collar from the wind. "Nature" has arranged this creek into a picture of exquisite beauty, a poetic realm full of life. The poet stops in astonishment.</p>
<p>"It is not the poet who can be intoxicated by the autumn mood on the creek, but the sleepy-eyed fisherman; it is not the poems that can describe the autumn colors on the creek, but the elusive, wonderful hand of 'Nature'!" Thinking this way, the poet's poems fall from his hand, letting the clear wind blow them away, not regretting their scattered flight. At this moment, the poet feels for the first time a poetic feeling and autumn thoughts that cannot be written on paper.</p>

<p>— Tianma</p>
<p>Two, Ticket Inspection</p>
<p>Everyone of course knows what ticket inspection is, but ticket inspection on a ship is a little different, because every time there's a ticket inspection, it seems like a tragedy is being deliberately staged, making you unable to bear to watch it, but also unable to bear not to watch it.</p>
<p>This tragedy is staged as follows: a crew member leads a few deckhands, with a few armed but not majestic "comrades" following from a distance, searching for beasts like hunters, shouting as they walk: "Ticket inspection, ticket inspection!" Of course, the protagonists of this tragedy will definitely not be the gentlemen and ladies in the grand dining room, nor the compradors in the staterooms, and even the passengers in the mid-level cabins don't often get a role. The actors in this tragedy are mostly the poorly dressed, sallow-faced people in steerage, returning disappointed from the city or going to the city from the countryside with golden dreams.</p>
<p>The ticket inspectors shout louder and louder as they go from the grand dining room to the staterooms and then to the cabins. They know that they should use a certain tone and attitude when dealing with a certain class. Once they get to steerage, "Ticket inspection!" is no longer a shout, it's simply a furious roar. The deckhands and the "comrades" with special powers brace themselves, because experience tells them that there will definitely be many pitiful insects here for them to exert their power on, to tease, make fun of, and joke with. At this time, among this group of sallow-faced people, those who luckily have tickets of course cautiously take them out of their pockets, while those without tickets are flustered, heads down, silent, waiting for the inevitable misfortune to come.</p>
<p>"Tickets!" the deckhand shouts like thunder. "N-no..." a faint, murmuring reply.</p>
<p>"Pig, trying to sneak on board without a ticket. Go, to the purser's office!" Then a hero grabs the ragged collar like an eagle catching a chick and pushes him to the purser's office, and incidentally, you might even hear a crisp slap.</p>
<p>"Tickets!" he asks another person, a "retired comrade" wearing a gray hat or draped in a tattered gray coat. But what he takes out is not a ticket, but a "pass."</p>
<p>This is where our "armed comrades" get their turn. A "comrade" steps forward. "Why didn't you buy a ticket?" "I don't have money, I'm going home after being dismissed." The answer is also low. "To the purser's office!" The ending is usually the same. Like this, one, two, the purser's office is crowded with a large group – a group of prisoners quietly awaiting judgment.</p>
<p>Here, our purser and squad leader comrades should come on stage. As usual, they ask five at a time: "Why didn't you buy a ticket?" The answer is always the same: "I don't have money."</p>
<p>"Trying to sneak on board without money?" The purser sneers fiercely, and the squad leader shouts loudly. The group of poor wretches is always quiet, no one makes a sound.</p>
<p>"Search!" the purser orders. Several deckhands grab one, strip off his clothes, and search carefully, but the report is always that he has no money, or only a few coppers. (To be continued)</p>

<p>— Translated by Kang Sitan Ding. Feier Zuolin</p>
<p>He spoke enthusiastically about the Martin-type open-hearth furnace factory, just like yesterday at the earthworkers' meeting. In that moment, he was no longer a student at the literacy eradication center, and this room in the technical department where the literacy eradication center was located no longer felt like a classroom. The students were all adults, almost all working at the open-hearth furnace construction site. They all understood what Dingga was saying at this moment. If someone were to run into the classroom at this time, they would never think that they were in a literacy eradication center class. They would definitely think that they were holding a meeting of the open-hearth furnace factory, like those being held everywhere on the construction site, discussing how to complete the construction of the factory within the deadline, so that the first open-hearth furnace could be put into operation on May 15th, and planning how to continue if possible... a gathering of the majority of people on many other issues. Maria Fotrovna was no longer a female teacher, no, she was just an attendee at the meeting, only able to speak in order of发言。. "This deadline cannot be said to be absolutely correct," someone said. "It's absolutely correct," another said. "Let's start the lesson," Maria Fotrovna said slowly. "Don't waste our time on irrelevant matters."</p>
<p>"After 10 o'clock," when Dingga and Kobedkin went outside, Kobedkin said, "Dingga, are you trying to overthrow me? I read the newspaper, and you read the newspaper," saying that, he laughed. "You're right, the newspaper is indeed easy to read, but I can also read books now. If you don't believe me, read it to me." "I don't mean that," Dingga said. "I don't want to overthrow you." Maria Fotrovna caught up with them.</p>
<p>"Teacher Comrade," Dingga said. "Not being able to read and write makes us suffer a lot, the suffering is truly indescribable. There are only two people editing the newspaper, but our work is too much for even five people to write. Can you help us revise the manuscripts?"</p>
<p>"Yes," Maria Fotrovna said.</p>
<p>"Please." "Okay."</p>

<h3 id="e251">The Wonderful Opportunity of Lincoln <a href="#e251" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c251" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">251</a></h3>
<p>Today, I happened to flip through a foreign magazine, which contained an article titled "Lincoln's Opportunity to Become President." I found it quite interesting. His narrative is roughly as follows:</p>
<p>This famous president in history, Lincoln, had a son named Robert Lincoln. He was originally working as a clerk in Springfield, Illinois, and in 1859, he went east to apply to Harvard University. As a result, this brother's level was really too lacking. He failed fifteen out of sixteen subjects. His parents did not want him to return to Springfield, so they sent him to Phillips Academy for a year of remedial studies. There, his grades were quite satisfactory. However, Mr. Lincoln was afraid that his son would fail again, so he decided to go east to see him once for safety's sake.</p>
<p>At that time, their family's finances were not very good, so Mr. Lincoln had to give speeches everywhere to supplement his travel expenses. One of his speeches at the Cooper Union attracted the attention of the leading figures in New York City, who discovered his talent.</p>
<p>Initially, during the 1860 presidential election, William Seward seemed to be the most assured candidate. If Seward's plan of voting on Thursday afternoon had been followed, his victory would have undoubtedly belonged to Seward. However, because the printing house failed to deliver the ballots on time, it had to be changed to Friday morning. That very night, the forces of Lincoln and Cameron reached an agreement. As a result, Lincoln was elected president on Friday morning.</p>
<p>Later, Robert often said humorously to people that his father's election as president was really due to his efforts. If he had not failed so many subjects, his father would definitely not have gone east. If he had not gone east, he would never have been elected.</p>
<p>Indeed, this is true. If it were not for his son's failure that time, Lincoln might have quietly lived and died in his hometown. Who would have thought that his son's failure would have given him the opportunity to become president, to become a prominent figure in history? The world is so wonderfully unpredictable.</p>
<p>Therefore, I want to advise my beloved young compatriots, if you fail at something now, please do not be discouraged, because your failure may be the opportunity for your fathers, brothers, or yourselves to become great figures and achieve great things. However, conversely, if you encounter something very successful, please do not be overly arrogant and conceited, because your good fortune this time may also be the foundation for your fathers, brothers, or yourselves to be discredited and ruined in the future. The world is truly wonderful! Just like I happened to flip through this passage today, which made me turn over a thought, perhaps it also has something to do with my future destiny, so it cannot be said to be accidental!</p>

<h3 id="e252">A Clay Figure (Continuation) <a href="#e252" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c252" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">252</a></h3>
<p>Why are you crying so hard? Aren't the toys in the big box in the back room enough? What else do you want, you little brat!</p>
<p>The pockmarked nanny said at this time: "This was originally brought by Mr. Xi himself, the little master doesn't necessarily want anything..."</p>
<p>"Heh! Little thing, you didn't even see the person clearly!..."</p>
<p>In such a situation, asking "Is the master home?" would be too tactless. Old Xi had this kind of cleverness. Although he could not bear such a face, he had no choice but to endure it. He tiptoed out the door, returned home with a pale face, and could not help but grind his teeth and slam the table for a while, vowing never to go to "Xibao Xiaozhu" again.</p>
<p>However, (never go to "Xibao Xiaozhu" again) was just a statement made in anger. Old Xi could not give up that "considerable opportunity." His wife would never agree to him giving it up.</p>
<p>The wife thought that the next time they went to "Xibao Xiaozhu," they should first try to build a relationship with that "little fellow."</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Old Xi was so poor that he didn't even have money to buy something that could build a relationship with the "little fellow."</p>
<p>His daughter, Bobo, had a large clay figure, a "Wuxi Specialty," which her cousin who lived in Wuxi had sent her last year. Since Bobo didn't have "a big box of toys in the back room" like others, this "golden-headed, red-faced" clay figure had become her only beloved treasure. She dressed it up, put on a hat, and played with it all day long. It was Bobo's only good companion.</p>
<p>The wife's thoughts suddenly turned to Bobo's only companion: "Take Bobo's clay figure to coax that little fellow!"</p>
<p>"Hmm...?..." Old Xi could not agree with his wife's idea. He loved Bobo, just like all parents love their children....</p>
<p>"…………………"</p>
<p>"Hmm, that's the only way, I guess." Old Xi finally agreed with his wife's idea.</p>
<p>"………………" Bobo looked at her parents with wide eyes, hugging the clay figure, seeming to understand and not understand.</p>
<p>The wife winked at Old Xi, pouted, and started talking about something else.</p>
<p>When Bobo was asleep at night, the wife secretly took the clay figure, put it in a square box, and placed it aside.</p>
<p>The next day, Bobo discovered that her beloved clay figure had been stolen. Her cheeks turned red with anxiety. She asked her father, but her father said he didn't know. She asked her mother, but her mother said she hadn't seen it. Bobo cried sadly. The mother comforted her gently, and the father bought a penny's worth of candy to put in Bobo's mouth, and Bobo immediately stopped crying. The father put on his shirt, picked up the square box, and went out, saying that he was going to buy something good for Bobo. Bobo jumped up and down with joy. As Old Xi walked away from home, about ten steps away, he could still hear little Bobo happily shouting: "Come back soon, Daddy!"</p>
<p>The coolness of the ice cream calmed Old Xi's restless emotions. He stood up and walked back to "Xibao Xiaozhu."</p>
<p>He thought, surely that little fellow won't bother me again today? Surely that pockmarked woman won't say cold words again? ...Ah, such a beautiful and large "Wuxi Afu"... Bobo must still be crying!... No, if I get the job, I'll definitely buy ten of them for Bobo... Surely Lao Gu will have good news for me today...</p>
<p>Old Xi's heart was bursting with joy. He seemed to see Mrs. Gu's welcoming smile. He seemed to feel that he was already sitting in front of a mahogany desk. In an instant, Old Xi walked into the front door of Xibao Xiaozhu with extraordinary calmness.</p>
<p>The first thing he saw was the disheveled Bair dog and the nanny playing with their young master under the steps.</p>
<p>Old Xi walked quietly towards them. As usual, the child immediately stopped smiling and started crying.</p>
<p>"Mom! The fool is here again!"</p>
<p>The pockmarked woman pouted and looked away. The Bair dog also started barking wildly. However, Old Xi did not feel embarrassed today. He calmly opened the cardboard box, took out the golden-headed, red-faced "Afu" and held it high in the air: "Don't cry, good boy, I brought something good today!"</p>
<p>The child stared with his small eyes, and immediately smiled. He ran under Old Xi's arm and pulled on Old Xi's long gown.</p>
<p>"What? What? Give it to me! Give it to me!"</p>
<p>Old Xi smiled and handed the clay figure to the child. The child smiled, and the child's happiness made the dog and the nanny change their attitude. The child's happiness made Old Xi feel a burst of light in his heart.</p>
<p>The child held the clay figure and ran towards his mother inside, shouting loudly.</p>
<p>"Mom, a beautiful clay figure! Look!"</p>
<p>With a thud, somehow the child tripped. The clay figure was shattered, and pieces were embedded in the child's forehead. Blood flowed from the forehead, and the child wailed.</p>
<p>"What's going on? Why did you trip again?" The mother ran out from inside, flustered. "Hmm, Nanny! Who gave him this junk? How could he take this..."</p>
<p>Suddenly, a huge stone sank into Old Xi's heart, making him tremble all over.…………</p>
<p>1921, night.</p>
<h3 id="e253">The Different Ways the World Eats Dinner <a href="#e253" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c253" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">253</a></h3>
<p>How interesting it is to compare this question! However, I am not a culinary expert, nor am I a Western cuisine chef. Therefore, I may not be able to write about this issue completely; I will simply provide a brief report based on the detailed analysis of what I know!</p>
<p>Also, since the meals of various countries are comparatively richer and more complex at dinner, I will specifically use it to represent the others.</p>
<p>In the United States, during the prohibition era, no alcohol was available in restaurants or dining halls. Therefore, besides a large number of appetizers and fruits, one could only drink strong milk tea or coffee. However, in the restaurants opened by us Chinese, wine was surreptitiously served in teapots. As a result, Chinese restaurants were extremely popular among Americans at that time. But once the prohibition was lifted, they no longer needed to go to Chinese restaurants. As for the components of their meals, they mostly consisted of cheese, meat, protein, starch, and some pastries.</p>
<p>England is similar to the United States, except their dining rooms often do not serve alcohol.</p>
<p>Russia and Germany are generally the same. They have a bowl of soup and two or three plates of vegetables and meat. Italy, besides the soup, only has two types of meat, and very little at that. Even if you eat it all, you still won’t be full. However, their soup often contains a small amount of meat. Moreover, because they enjoy eating sour foods, they like to add vinegar to all three dishes. Pasta is also common. In addition, they eat rice once a week.</p>
<p>Spain and Portugal, besides a bowl of soup, have four kinds of meat, as well as ice cream and pastries, especially good cakes, and a lot of fruit. Hungarian soup contains meat, which is quite similar to our Chinese style. Norway, due to geographical reasons, often has no lunch. Dinner, on the other hand, features a table piled high with cold cuts and pastries, which guests can take as they please without any restrictions. The waiters only serve tea and coffee. Sweden, besides soup and appetizers, only has one dish of meat, but a lot of vegetables. If you don't like vegetables much, relying only on a bowl of soup and a dish of meat won't be enough to fill you up, but you can try some seafood.</p>
<p>Japan is a naturally frugal country, and there is no distinction between their dinner and lunch. Their rice portion is also very small. Usually, in addition to a small bowl of rice, the side dishes are only a piece of salted radish and a small plate of vegetables. Even middle-class families only add half a piece of raw fish. As for other meats, they are rarely seen except during grand banquets.</p>
<p>However, in our China, it is the complete opposite of Japan. For families above the middle class, the expenses for lunch and dinner are several yuan, tens of yuan, or even hundreds of yuan, which is not considered unusual. This expenditure is indeed astonishing.</p>
<p>Typically, dinners in various countries are usually between 7:00 PM and 8:00 PM. However, Spain often eats after 8:30 PM, and Germany at 7:00 PM.</p>
<p>Dinners are also not common [in Germany]. Because they have lunch at 3:00 PM, dinner has to be delayed accordingly. We Chinese eat at no fixed time. Young masters and concubines have breakfast at 11:00 AM or 12:00 PM, lunch becomes afternoon tea, and dinner is delayed until after 8:00 PM or 9:00 PM. By midnight, 1:00 AM or 2:00 AM, they still eat a midnight snack before going to bed. This is a common unhealthy habit of the upper class. We don't find it strange, but foreigners are always surprised when they see it!</p>

<p>Standing in front of the payment counter at ×× University, my hand trembled as I pulled out one hundred and thirty dollars from my waist. My heart ached. This was my father's hard-earned money!</p>
<p>After taking the receipt, I wanted to register. I couldn’t. I still needed twenty dollars for the uniform fee. I felt my pocket, and I only had fifteen dollars, but this was my book money. Heaven, what to do? Could I get an exemption? No. Could I pay later? I could, but if I registered tomorrow, I would have to pay a fine, two dollars a day!</p>
<p>There was no way around it. I had to pay the fee. I couldn't afford not to study. So, with tears in my eyes, I immediately went to my relatives in Shanghai to borrow the money. When I handed in those twenty dollars for the uniform fee, my hand trembled again.</p>
<p>Under the dim dormitory electric light, I wrote a letter home. After reporting this matter to my father, I said: This time, I was deceived.</p>

<p>Headmaster: Yes, this weather... Hahahaha! (The military authority appears on the balcony with the young master, followed by the wife.)</p>
<p>Wife: Well, since there are guests, why don't you go see them? Military authority: Ai! Why don't you understand this? This is the secret of us officials. (To the young master) Look! The red gourd on the roof, how red it is! It looks very good. Young master: That's right, it looks like a severed head.</p>
<p>Headmaster: Is Chairman Yu not here? Confidential secretary: No, he is here. But he is dealing with an extremely important matter. He will come out in a while.</p>
<p>Headmaster: Yes, yes, these days are the critical moment. He must be responsible to the country and the people, so... Confidential secretary: That's right, these days we are simply too busy.</p>
<p>Young master: Can you teach me to play cards now? Military authority: What are you saying? I'll teach you to play cards? And am I not very busy now? How can I have time to teach you to gamble?</p>
<p>Wife: I think you should play with him for a while; he is always bothering me all day long.</p>
<p>Headmaster: Recently, the armistice talks, I heard, are proceeding very smoothly, is that so? Military authority: Hmph, this is too much! This little child wants to learn to gamble. Go, pour me a glass of brandy inside. (Young master enters.)</p>
<p>Confidential secretary: How smooth can we say? But after many efforts from our side, now both sides are getting along very well. Especially the Japanese side has a fundamental understanding of us. This point can be gratifying to the people.</p>
<p>Headmaster: Being able to make the Japanese side understand is already a great achievement. But from my personal observation, I always think we should continue to resist. In terms of China's current position, we have only three paths to take in the face of this serious situation. One, direct negotiations; two, recovery of lost territories; three, resistance to the death. Now, the hatred of the general public towards Japan can be said to be unparalleled, so the current direct negotiations are extremely opposed by the people, which is undeniable... This is not to say that the government's handling of the armistice is inappropriate, but that the people are too indignant. As for recovering the lost territories, we are simply unprepared in terms of armaments and economy, so there is nothing to talk about. Confidential secretary: That's right, it is very true. Others have airplanes, tanks, and all kinds of sharp weapons. We have nothing. What do we rely on to recover the lost territories? Only those who have no military knowledge at all sing the high tune of recovering lost territories.</p>
<p>Military authority: (Drinks a glass of brandy from his son's hand. Looks at his watch again.) Hmph, I want a full ten minutes. Now I'll go see him. (Enters)</p>

<p>The issue of film actors' skills, as raised by Mr. Huang Junru in the 15th issue of this publication, is indeed an important matter. Because when making a film, if it is ignored, it becomes a newsreel.</p>
<p>It is good that Mr. Huang hopes that critics and audiences will pay attention to this issue. But beyond that, I think the most important key lies in the talent and experience of the director.</p>
<p>When shooting a film, the actor is directed by the director, which is a well-known fact. An ordinary actor, under the direction of a capable director, can show good results. Conversely, a talented actor under a mediocre director often buries his true colors. In the anecdotes of Hollywood's actor selection, we can find many such examples.</p>
<p>Secondly, many other conditions on the filming set can also affect the actor's skills. Take photography as an example. When an actor has not fully expressed a certain action (such as laughing loudly), a "Cut" suddenly comes from the director, and of course the result will definitely be unsatisfactory to the actor.</p>
<p>In addition to the relationship between the actor and the director as described above, there is also a necessary link between the actor and the screenwriter.</p>
<p>Under normal circumstances, if the screenwriter does not start from fantasy and tries to provide vivid facts, and if the screenwriter does not start from subjective imagination and can consciously understand the various realities of the actor, then this is of great assistance to the actor. On the contrary, if many unnecessary actions are made according to a dull script, the result is not only that the actor is criticized by critics and audiences, but also the director is helpless.</p>
<p>The third condition is also necessary, namely the actor's environment. The environment of Chinese actors need not be said. Let's talk about the Hollywood actors. Because the film business aims at pursuing profits, actors are ultimately not used as "people" but consumed as "machines." After a three- or five-year contract expires, you can get lost. Under these conditions, the actor's only hope is to shoot more films and get more money. Just imagine, under these circumstances, where do they have enough time to study the script, ponder the movements, and understand the psychology? Where do they have enough time to make great artistic in-depth studies? In the end, except for a few who sacrifice for art, I am afraid that most of them have only become the director's echo bugs.</p>
<p>I have put forward three opinions above in a scattered manner. My intention is not to ask critics and audiences to give actors some leniency for their skills. My intention is to point out that these conditions are very important before a film is made. Otherwise, it is unfair to criticize the actor based solely on the actor's performance, forgetting the other prerequisites that determine the actor's skills.</p>
<p>Film World Random Talks</p>
<h3 id="e260">Faith Baldwin's Advice <a href="#e260" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c260" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">260</a></h3>
<p>— Zhongqin</p>
<p>Faith Baldwin is an American art expert. The Hollywood Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences hired him as a judge and consultant. He spends his days in theaters. His criticisms of actors are always pertinent. The following are some mottos he wrote for actors.</p>
<p>Katherine Francis: You are one of the most affectionate women, especially in "The Playboy," but your dialogue is too forced. Be calmer, or a childlike attitude is most suitable for you.</p>
<p>Eddie Cantor: You are a major figure in the film world, but your laughter is an unnatural trembling sound. You have a great future, and I hope you pay attention to it.</p>
<p>Rock: Undoubtedly, your jokes are in the same category as Chaplin's, but Chaplin's works are full of infinite meaning, which seems to make him better than you. Please pay attention.</p>
<p>Chaplin: Your recent works are rare. I hope you will make a few more. Don't rely on hard work because you have become a rich man.</p>
<p>Gary Cooper: You drag out the syllables of your words too long. I know you haven't gotten rid of the Italian accent, please practice more.</p>
<p>Frederic March: You are just right in "The Royal Family of Broadway," but I hope you don't imitate Barrymore. He has his own style, and you can't learn it.</p>
<p>Katharine Hepburn: Your greatness in "A Bill of Divorcement" doesn't need my publicity, but I have also seen many of your stage plays. I think you can be a satirical actor, so I hope you don't play roles like "A Bill of Divorcement" again, and develop your satirical style.</p>
<p>Elissa Landi: You must never play glamorous roles. You are a quiet and gentle woman and should play quiet roles. You are also too honest.</p>
<p>Myrna Loy: You are very suitable for using compassion to make everyone sympathize. You can also insert humorous jokes in the middle.</p>
<p>Helen Hayes: Hollywood praises your beauty very much, but your acting is not entirely based on your appearance, which you should recognize.</p>
<p>ZaSu Pitts: You work too much, which has caused you to get sick. I am very worried about you. I hope you don't work on so many films in the future. You can focus your energy on one film. It is more energy-saving and easier to be refined than acting in many films. Mr. Stuart Hemsley said that you are a tragedian. I agree. If possible, try acting in a tragedy, but the public impression of you in comedies is too deep. Or you have to change your appearance, film after makeup, but I am afraid it will be very troublesome.</p>
<p>Clara Bow: You still have innocent enthusiasm. I hope you will use a young woman's enthusiasm to describe your unrestrained nature. You are older, which is needed, and you can't learn from naughty children anymore.</p>
<h3 id="e261">Bebe Daniels' Sentimental Words <a href="#e261" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c261" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">261</a></h3>
<p>— Luofen</p>
<p>British star Bebe Daniels once said to people: "If people in the film industry want to become famous, there is no other way but to go to Hollywood. London, Paris, Berlin, and Vienna are not enough. Anyone who has talent can only go to Hollywood to avoid burying their own talent."</p>
<p>What does Bebe Daniels mean by this? She is not praising Hollywood, nor is she flattering it because she has been reused by Americans in Hollywood. Her words are very sentimental. Let's talk about the environment she encountered before to understand.</p>
<p>Bebe Daniels grew up in Bristol, England. Her father was a lawyer. Bebe Daniels was always precocious since she was a child. After graduating from middle school, she entered a music school. Later, she entered the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London. After graduating, she acted in stage plays in London.</p>
<p>Bebe Daniels was very frustrated in the stage play world. So she looked for other opportunities. She saw that the film industry in London seemed worth a try, but when she got into the film industry, because she didn't have any reputation, the result was the same as on the stage. For a long time, she was still a very small, unknown actor. She saw that the film industry in England was too conservative, and newcomers had no opportunities. So she decided to leave England again to look for opportunities.</p>
<p>Bebe Daniels first went abroad to Paris, where she was as frustrated as she was in London. She left Paris and arrived in Berlin. In Berlin, she initially had no opportunity to enter the film industry. Later, she was admitted to Ufa, but because the salary was very small, she resigned soon after. Later, she arrived in Vienna, the capital of Austria, where she didn't have a smooth day. Finally, she returned to London. When she traveled to various countries, she heard a lot about the Hollywood film industry, so she decided to go to Hollywood to try her luck.</p>
<p>Sure enough, she became popular in Hollywood, fulfilling her wish. In Hollywood, she is now a top-tier foreign star. When she first arrived in Hollywood, she played the leading role in MGM's "Clear All Wires". She sighed about her previous encounters, which is why she had the sentimental words: "Only by going to Hollywood can you become famous."</p>
<h3 id="e262">Beauty Standards in the Film World <a href="#e262" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c262" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">262</a></h3>
<p>— Bing</p>
<p>When it comes to beauty, people in Europe and the United States generally divide it into two types. One type, with golden hair and fair skin, is called Blonde, and the other type, with brown-black hair, is called Brunette.</p>
<p>Many movie stars in Hollywood are nothing more than these two major standards. But these two types of standard beauties have had many fortunate and unfortunate changes. During the most prosperous era of the Hollywood film industry, the so-called blonde beauties occupied the most popular position in the film world. Later, women with brown hair became popular and seized the position of blonde women. About six years ago, all film companies, no matter which one, used brown-haired beauties as the standard for selecting stars. At that time, blonde women all asked beauticians to turn their golden hair into brown hair.</p>
<p>But recently, blonde hair has regained its advantage in the film world's standard of beauty. According to Paramount Pictures' report, in a new film, the actors used to shoot a nightclub dance scene had as many as fifty women who were blonde. Only about ten women had brown-black hair and skin.</p>
<p>According to the results of the investigation, in the past five years, blonde beauties and brown-haired women have always maintained a balanced position in the film world, with occasional ups and downs, but no significant changes. The reason is very simple, because the current makeup techniques are very sophisticated, which can allow blonde beauties and brown-haired women to change at will.</p>
<h3 id="e263">Jacques O'Keefe and His Mother on Stage <a href="#e263" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c263" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">263</a></h3>
<p>— Bing</p>
<p>Jacques O'Keefe, the famous hat-throwing friend of Paramount Pictures, is a man who refuses to be easily subdued. He often sulks at Paramount over his treatment, but because of his good voice and decent acting skills, he is highly regarded by the general staff at Paramount. Last time, when he was filming "College Humor" for Paramount, he was asked to compensate for a day's absence, and he immediately resigned. Later, the company softened its stance. Although Jacques likes to throw his hat around, he usually works hard for the company. This time, he is playing the lead in Paramount's new film "Too Much Harmony." Because they were missing an old woman for a supporting role, the company was in great difficulty. However, Jacques O'Keefe dragged his own mother out of his home and introduced her to play the part. Because she was playing Jacques' mother in the play, Paramount auditioned her and the results were excellent, so they officially hired her. As for her salary, because she is Jacques' mother, it couldn't be less than Jacques', so it was set according to Jacques' salary. In the film industry, there are siblings or couples co-starring in the same film, but as for a mother and son co-starring in a film, Jacques O'Keefe and his mother are the first of its kind.</p>

<p>Elizabeth thought that a noisy place like Brooklyn was not suitable for a refined artist, but putting him on the top floor of the apartment, with the nude paintings in the room and the sea view outside the window, might be acceptable. Perhaps occasional unexpected luxuries and the comfort of a home could make him forget the ferocious landlady, the dirty cloths in the small restaurant, and the cockroaches in the kitchen. Elizabeth remembered the various torments and humiliations that Leonard had suffered in the past, and she felt sorry for him. She hoped that from now on, under her protective wings, he could fulfill his great ambitions.</p>
<p>The Limburger family was in a complete mess. It always was, but this time it was especially so. Mrs. Limburger was washing her hair in the bathroom of her own bedroom, with soap and hair everywhere. The gramophone was playing loudly. Douglas was practicing fencing with his bare hands in front of the dressing mirror. Kenneth was arguing with his lover on the phone. And the youngest brother, Eddie, still wearing last night's dinner suit, was rummaging through the suitcase, throwing things around, making a mess everywhere. Elizabeth looked at it from upstairs and sighed.</p>
<p>But Leonard's room was much calmer. The typewriter was already set up upstairs. Novel manuscripts were scattered all over the bed. Elizabeth stood at his door. Leonard looked at her, but she knew he didn't see her. What he saw was the plot of the next paragraph of his novel, a masterpiece of "raging storms and thunder." She wanted to sit in his room and watch him, but her past experience told her that the noise of others would cause subtle chemical reactions in his mind. The big children were making noise downstairs, and the gramophone was grinding in her ears, but the sound suddenly stopped. Elizabeth went downstairs to see what was going on. She saw Mrs. Limburger arranging her wet hair, and the children were all gathered around looking at a telegram. Mrs. Limburger muttered to herself, "What is margin money? The broker says we need to add more margin money?" Kenneth ignored her. He said, "Listen, the telegram says that if there is no reply by 2:30 this afternoon, your account will be closed on your behalf. Mother, what is going on?" Mrs. Limburger said calmly, "Even I don't know." Kenneth shouted again, "Another telegram, it says, 'We have not received your reply so far, your account has been sold.'" Mrs. Limburger said, "This is the last telegram." The children looked at each other, and asked in unison, "What is going on?" Mrs. Limburger hugged her big belly with both hands, and nodded solemnly, saying, "This means that from now on we have to find another way to make a living." Kenneth grabbed the telegram paper in his hand and said angrily to his mother, "Why didn't you ever mention it to us? Mother, is our family property really gone? Do we have any stocks left?"
