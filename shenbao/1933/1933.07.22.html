<p>時評</p>
<h3>世界經濟會議閉會以後實</h3>
<p>此次世界經濟會議。集六十六國代表一千五百餘人於倫敦。政治領袖外交名流學術專家。都爲全世界有名人物。不可謂非凡爾賽和約以來國際上最大之盛會。在當時與會各代表。固皆滿懷熱望。以爲經濟會議。必能打開當前之難局。挽救遍佈世界之經濟危機矣。而不謂開會之第三日。英美間即因戰債問題。發生不快之感。會塲情勢。頓顯不安。於是政治問題。擱置不談。德國胡根堡提議進攻蘇聯之說。己成過去。收回殖民地之言。亦等虚語。甚至實際問題中與經濟恐慌有密切關聯之通貨安定問題。原爲去年洛桑會議所擬議程中最主要之議題。亦以美國之急於提高國内物價。不肯放棄其通貨膨賑政策。致形成維持金本位國家如法比瑞士荷蘭等大陸國家。對美英日等非金本位國家。嚴重對立而無由解决。在英日兩國。以放棄金本位制時期己久國内市塲旣漸穩定。國際匯兌亦相當平穩。對法蘭西所主張之通貨安定。可表贊同。而對美國之經濟的國家主義。則不免懷疑。故開會迄今四十日。政治關係。固未能因外交詞令之妙而有所改善。復興經濟市面之希望。亦甚鮮少於是無期休會之說。不得不見諸實施矣。</p>
<p>然則各國果皆厲行國家主義。實行封鎖政策。努力於經濟的自給自足。其結果又將何如耶。法蘭西爲當今大藏金國之一。其現金準備達紙幣流通總額百分之九十八。彼爲保持其在歐洲之金融支配權力及維護其對外投資利息收回。之利益起見。雖一般物價。較之一九一四年跌落百分之二十二。亦不能不維持其金本位制。即令對外貿易。一時不能發展。但苟能維持原狀。亦可滿足。至失業問題。在官方統計爲三十一萬。此雖僅指受政府救濟。公認爲失業者而言。然至多恐亦不過百萬。故法國之困難。或可以歷史之擋持力。暫時克服。惟此經濟恐慌之醖釀。終不免受英美日及其他各國貶低貨幣平價之影響。則又不能不以加高關稅。爲最有效之武器。此所以經濟之危機。依然存在也。美國之國家主義。其主要意義。在提高物價。刺激産業界之奮起。無如消貨市塲狹小。國内消費力之增加。不及生産指數上漲五分之一。是以美國欲求解决此一千二百萬失業工人之職業問題。勢不能不從事於不生産之軍事工業。以求補救。英國之保守政策。在積極擴張大英帝國内之經濟聯盟。以求其國内之自給自足。此種辦法。救一時之急。固無不可。若欲以之克制世界之恐慌。挽回當前之厄運。則殊不敢必。至於日本横行東亞。欲藉飛機大砲之力以支配經濟。用純消費之軍事工業。以激剌産業界之景氣。是否於事實有補。凡稍有經濟常識者類能知之。吾人試觀日本歷年收支預算之不足。專恃公債爲塡補。過度之剥削。雖有軍閥之强壓。可以予取予求。然亦不能有濟於其國家社會之窮窘。與一般社會思想之恶化。三年以來。因政治關係而被捕入獄者在八千人以上。其内部之動搖可見矣。</p>
<p>歐美各國在世界經濟會議席上。旣不能求得共同合作之點。而復興經濟。又非閉關所能有效。故閉會以後世界之情勢。將如何演變。殊難懸揣。惟我中國之市塲。乃資本國家最好之消貨塲所。爲世界各國解决其經困難者所必爭。此後無論其爲聯合經營。抑爲戰獨競爭。我國均不易應付。將有何策以圖自全乎。</p>

<p>全體大會開會後、柯里恩宣讀美國提議、希望各國政府在休會時期中、以外交等途徑提出切實辦法、以試行大會所以召集之旨趣、同時美國建議以較諸現有者更爲確切之條件、延長關稅休戰（二十一日路透電）</p>

<p>非築高稅壁認爲不足應付競爭</p>
<p>日本促開印日通商交涉</p>
<p>電令松平向英接洽三項</p>
<p>（倫敦）今日午後下院動議休會時、曾討論日本絲貨棉貨競爭事、殖民大臣李斯特答復問話、承認殖民地所享之優惠待遇、不足應付此項競爭、欲求殖民地應付得宜、須將某某數種商品增高稅率至百分之二百、此次與日本之商務談判如遭失敗、則殖民地自將實施保護英國利益之步驟云觀此、英日間劇烈商戰之可能性、今愈趨愈近矣、（二十日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）昨日英下院開會時、保守黨議員勒維提出日本貨物在帝國境内競爭問題、謂係經濟上一種威脅在帝國歷史上所未經見者、即以棉絲兩業而論、日本貨物競爭、足使英國實業感受無窮之損害、苟欲避免此種損害、自非採取緊急手段不可、自一九三○至一九三二年兩年之中、英國絲織品出口數額减少百分之二十、同時日本絲織品之輸出則日益增加、在本年份較之一九三一年、將增加三十三倍之多、又在英國各殖民地境内、日本貨物亦極力推銷、而不購買回頭貨、去年日本曾以價値三十萬鎊之貨物售予英屬美洲雅買加島、而向該島所購之貨僅値三百六十鎊而己、至在棉織業方面、、其現象亦復相同、英國若不注意應付、恐將噬臍無及云云、殖民地大臣李斯特爵士答稱、全球各地日貨競爭情形確屬可畏、英日兩國實業界代表行將開會、討論此事、商務大臣倫西曼己向下院言之、李氏又謂、英國在帝國各屬所享受之優惠待遇、用以抵制法德美諸國貨物之競爭、綽有餘裕、但欲制止日貨競爭則嫌其不足、即以人造絲而論、日本貨物價値與英貨相較實低廉百分之百、李氏結論謂日本與英國各殖民地貿易極盛、若令各該殖民地將日貨進口稅增至百分之二百、未免不合情理、以渠所見、倫西曼商相現方與日本政府舉行談判、吾人當以全力援助之、俾克竟其全功云、云（二十一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（東京）關於印日通商問題、日政府要求英政府付與全權於印度政府、但英政府至今未有確答、且印度政府自八月十四日起至九月二十日、爲議會開會期亦不便接洽通商問題、若長此以進、至十月十日以前、通商問題恐無從解决、因此日商所受之損失不少、日外務省將電松平大使、向英政府接洽下列三事、（一）日印通商問題待議事項甚多、日望與議會並行開始交涉、（二）如不能並行交涉、則商約期限延至交涉成之日望英政府同意此種暫定辦法、（三）請英政府從速付與外交權於印度政府、否則、日政府不能派代表赴印交涉、（二十一日華聯電）</p>

<h3>環球美飛行家濮斯特百折不撓</h3>
<p>造成新紀錄之際突遇大霧</p>
<p>機身觸地損壞一俟修竣續飛</p>
<p>馬騰借俄機追踪而飛</p>
<p>國民社二十日范朋克電美飛行家濮斯特不幸於造成環球新紀錄希望將成事實之際、突遇大霧迷途七小時、致燃料告罄、被迫降落此間西方百哩許佛拉特村外坎坷不平之廣塲、機身觸地、損壞頗甚、差幸人未受傷、而濮氏亦雄心未衰、聲稱、一俟修竣立將續發赴紐約、</p>
<p>據濮言其機飛過路柏後、忽遇重霧迷途、霧勢之大、爲生平所未見、致在空中盲飛七小時、迨汽油告罄、飛機即下沉、乃設法使其滑飛而下、詎料下面爲坎坷不平之地、遂致機首觸地而覆、推進器爲之彎曲、據濮氏語往覓之飛行家、估計修理約須八小時、將自范朋克供給新推進器、按濮氏係今晨十時三十分過諾姆、下午一時卅分過路柏鎭其地在范朋克之西二百哩、、而其時機中所剩汽油尚可飛五百哩程、迨此油守候濮氏久久不至、飛行塲人員猶疑路柏所見者或爲測最阿拉斯加之飛機、不甚焦急旣而探測阿拉斯加之飛機抵此、據其駕駛員言、曾在此間西方一百七十哩處過濮斯特所來機、遂由其組織一搜尋隊始覓見濮氏及其破機云、</p>
<p>國民社二十一日范朋克電美飛行家馬騰由蘇俄飛行家李梵尼夫斯基自西伯利亞送回諾姆亦以汽油告罄被迫降落、諾姆附近一航空塲、今日馬濮兩人俱以油罄迫降此間、可謂無獨有偶矣、惟馬　所乘機、完好無恙、馬氏現將另假一機、繼續飛往紐約、馬係今日下午五時三十分降落、預計至早須至星期五晚始克成行、其抵紐約時間殆將與濮氏同時云、</p>

<p>塔斯二十日伯力電美環球飛行家濮斯特於今日下午十二點五十八分（當地時間）離北赴阿拉斯加之諾姆、未出發前彼謂、預期對於彼舊時八日十五小時五十一分之紀錄至少得超過二十四小時、並自信於十六小時内得到達諾姆、彼向塔斯社代表聲明、如坐待良好天氣、非於七月二十日而於二十一日離伯力、則彼僅能重襲一九三一年彼與加第氏所造之紀錄、故彼不顧天氣狀况之不適、决定不再逗留、彼並謂在彼自伯林飛赴伯力之行程中所遇之不良氣候、實摧挫彼長足改進一九三一年紀錄之機會不少也、當氏步入其温尼梅機之舵手室中時、對彼在飛行蘇聯程中所受之優渥待遇深致謝忱、彼謂彼在蘇聯停留各站俱受熱誠之歡迎、且接受各項彼所需要之技術援助云、</p>

<h3>編遣僞軍别訊</h3>
<p>日方亦望編遣早竣</p>

<h3>招商局闢瑞平新航路</h3>
<p>預計營業之利益</p>
<p>防止同業之競爭</p>
<p>招商局因温州輪廣濟號船身太小、不合行駛、决計另增海船、同時在温州綫内、開關新路、引起航界之競爭、記者特將此事情形、探誌如下、</p>
<h3>擴張航業</h3>
<p>上海至温州一路、滬上祗招商局有正班輪船兩艘行駛、一爲海晏一名廣濟、温州且有碼頭貨棧、客商最爲利便、顧滬上温州輪雖有多艘、而營業則以招商獨巨、近頃以廣濟輪船身極小、運貨無多、甚不合航行温州之用、局方己討論多次、决計在温州班内添加一千噸以上之海輪一艘、而替代小廣濟班次、實行擴張滬甌航業、此事己由該局營業科主任何墨林計議矣、</p>
<h3>開闢新綫</h3>
<p>浙東瑞安平陽與上海之往來貨物及旅客甚多、現在南市有輪局多家、專營此路航業者、如滬興之瑞平、新瑞平等、每五天開行一班今招商局以廣濟輪改行瑞安平陽、最爲合宜、船身吃水旣淺、而客位亦多、且可與温州聯接、此路開航定可獲利、因之總局特命甌分局長、親赴瑞平調查營業狀况、一面由局中計劃開班、刻己調查竣事、即將開航此新路云、</p>
<h3>營業狀况</h3>
<p>廣濟之經營瑞平航路、與他輪之路綫不同、蓋規定由滬先至温州、然後開赴瑞安之飛行江、就該處用駁船卸淸貨客、便順流開往平陽之鰲江停泊、瑞平兩地、並無海關分關、僅甌海關在兩處分設一稽徵處運裝貨物、多在温州關納稅後、至該兩埠、僅由稽徵處騐勘稅單也、現局方統計此新航路添行後、每次航行、除各種開支外、至少可餘一千元、</p>
<h3>同業競爭</h3>
<p>瑞安平陽等處、各商客辦理進出口貨者計有二十餘家、滬上同航路之各輪公司、得聞此訊、爲同業競爭計、己與各客家密訂包裝貨物之長期合同、爲業付該局新開航輪之抵制辦法、昨日温州分局、己發電來滬、報告總局、請速往疎通各客商、以免影響營業、現時各輪公司競爭瑞平航業、至爲激烈、</p>
<h3>熱河義軍領袖李海峯王藴萍來滬</h3>
<p>將招待新聞界報告抗日經過</p>
<p>熱河義軍領袖李海峯·王藴萍·兩氏、原任熱河省軍長官、自東北九一八事變發生、憤日暴行、即秘密聯絡軍隊及地方民衆、進行抗日工作、待錦榆之戰發生、熱河告急、湯玉麟正陰謀與日僞接洽叛國、即憤而組織熱河民衆抗日軍、在日軍開始進襲熱河時、親率所部、與日僞作戰、再捕俘關東軍代表石本權四郎、後熱省以湯逆之退遁而失陷、李等仍死守灤平一帶、扼險以據、迄今仍勢聲浩大、惟以與後方交通斷絶、音訊隔閡、在敵逆嚴重壓迫之下、彈盡援絶、因設法相伴潛至平津、日前又自平來滬、冀與各方取得聯絡、及徵詢後方同胞對今後抗日之指示、新聲社記者、昨特趨晤之於旅次、茲誌各情如下、</p>
<h3>領導民衆抗日</h3>
<p>李海峯氏、原供職北方軍界、屢任團旅長曁承德公安局長等職、九一八後、痛國土沉淪、即集合各方志士、秘密進行軍事抗日、聯合當地民衆、於錦榆之戰發生時、正式成立熱河民衆抗日軍、蓋東北民團、因頻年内亂之故、幾於每家備槍、當時熱省同胞、以處境急迫、均抱保國即所以保家之旨、一呼百應、加以各地民團之附和、湯玉麟部下矢志抗日者之參加、集合人數、最多曾超過三萬、但終係烏合之衆、各給養彈藥之困難、所部隨時增减無定、終不能擴大發展、即在於此、</p>
<h3>湯逆態度暧昧</h3>
<p>雖其到處受事實之限制、但李氏等仍始終抱定抗日到死之决心準備日僞如來犯熱、即予以迎頭痛擊、成敗固未計及、是尚爲去年此時之事、時湯玉麟對於國家之前途、猶存觀望、對中央旣不作懇切表示、一面復派員赴長春瀋陽、圖與日逆合汚、往返接洽、公然無忌、民衆處於湯玉麟之淫威下、因其態度噯昧、亦未敢有何表示、祇紛紛暗中三五成羣、投歸李部、</p>
<h3>捕石本權四郎</h3>
<p>去年舊歷七月十七日、湯玉麟與僞日之接洽、大致均己成熟關東軍司令本莊繁、即派高級參謀石本權四郎、正式携帶條件、乘坐專車來熱晤湯、李氏事先得到石本將來之消息、以爲如再不動手、則熱河完矣因集所部人員、討論應付辦法、後一致决議、派周營長率士卒十人、便衣携械、設法潛登石本專車、一面又預先埋伏大隊</p>
<h3>馬占山表示留察部隊對内</h3>
<p>馮果眞心抗日極表同情</p>

<p>自由談爲文化而競爭  華甫　　從接連出現於報端的小學敎科書廣告中，我辨覺到二種意義。　　第一種是爲文化而競爭。我們這國家，現在正被人譏嘲爲文化落後，有着百分之八十以上的人民是文盲。去年敎育部所發表的十八年的統計，顯示在全國的四一，四四一，○○○名學齡兒童中，祇有七，一一八，○○○名入初級小學，失學的在百分之八十二以上。這許多兒童的失學，没有錢繳費買書總是一個重要的原因。那麽把敎科書削了價向他們競賣，對於苦學的兒童便不失爲一種實惠。這樣的競爭對於文化當然不是無益的。　　在一家廣告所舉出的「特色」中，說他們的敎科書「絶非將舊書改頭換面充數」，「絶無一人包辦若干科之事」，似乎確實有他家是將舊書改頭換面充數，或以一人包辦若干科的。那麽，在原來商務，中華與世界三分「小學敎科書的天下」的局面下，今年有了開明與大東參加這事業，多出版幾部新的敎科書，供敎育界作自由的選擇，對於文化當然是有益的事。自然出版敎科書的人家多了便不免增多競爭，但如果競爭的結果能使敎育界多認識幾本好的新敎科書，那也不是無意義的。　　然而，在讀到了前天自由談上珠君的一篇文字後，我却覺到了敎科書競賣中的另一種意義，那就是所謂傾銷。「傾銷」，這個應用於市塲上商品競賣的名詞，爲什麽會轉用到敎科書這種「文化的工具」的銷行上來呢？起初我不解。接着，我想到了在美孚，亞細亞與德士古三分中國石油市塲的局面下，因光華的出現而引起的跌價競爭的現象。我恍然了，但我帶着一些顧慮。傾銷，這表示着單純的以資本的力量和營業的手段進行商品的競賣，如果這種競爭手段要被應用到敎科書的銷行上，那前面所講到的文化的意義就要被犧牲的。　　怎樣使敎科書的推行成爲純正的文化事業的競爭，而不流爲商品的傾銷，在目前確乎是重要的問題。出版家本身當然要負道德的責任，但是文化界的工作者，特别是敎育家，以至有知識的父母都應該負些責任的。珠君說，「不存私心的嚴正的批評」實屬必要，我覺得「不存私心」的誠懇的介紹是同樣地必要的。說窮途  徐懋庸　　在「有二百種之多」的全國定期刋物中，有一種「前途雜誌」，這名目引起了我一點點感想。　　就目前的事情說，集合了六十幾國的最偉大的政治家，在倫敦舉行着的世界經濟會議，前途就未許樂觀，「黄金的礁石」，把「堂堂大會」，觸得「只留軀殼」。夫以全世界最偉大的政治家之恊力，對於社會的基礎構造的經濟，尚不能諸坦途，可知現狀之下，其實並無什麽可希望的前途，有的只是嗣宗窮途，楊朱歧路」。　　一個朋友曾說··「什麽是前途！我以爲辦一圙窮途雜誌，倒會有超紀錄的成績。在普遍的窮途的悲哀中，作者定能産生眞實的人生的藝術，讀者定能發生眞誠的心靈的徐嗚。」　　當眞以「窮途」名的雜誌，雖然没有，但和這性質相同的刋物，實己不少，即所謂「許多幽默的刋物。」尚幽默，談風月，原是窮途的文人之所爲。社會的窮途，文人的窮途，産生了「幽默的刋物，」且風行一時。這些刋物，其實就是「窮途應雜誌。」　　然而，我輩靑年，將長此徘徊窮途，絶望而終乎？請記得故鄉的結語；　　「我想··希望是本無所謂有，無所謂無的。這正如地上的路；地上本没有路，走的人多了，也便成了路。」讀書瑣記  小雪　　（一）　　很多的作家，描寫具有革命性的人物，往往是忘却了他們和普通「人」一樣，有血有肉，有優點有缺點，而把它們寫成「天神」般的毫無缺陷。這完全是一種錯誤，說明作家對於「生活的辨正法」的不理解。這和綏拉菲莫維支，「鐵流」的著着，批評一部分蘇聯的作品一樣··好多作品都失之於單調，公式化···作者都忽略了生活的辨證法，把作品的主人公到革命的路上來的時候寫成走直路的。事實上一個充滿着内心矛盾的活人，到革命的路上來的時候，是走着很彎曲的路。有時主人公對革命不了解，有時躊躇，有時犯錯誤···在錯誤中去學習，在實際生活中去鍜鍊···經過了好多彎曲的路線才來到革命的路上。在作品裏邊要眞實的委曲婉轉的把這些轉彎的過程表現出來····在中國，如果翻開一九二八前後的作品來看，這樣的錯誤，是犯得最多的，小說中的革命人物，差不多有一定的「臉譜」，可以稱爲「臉譜主義」。在錯誤經騐的學習中，雖相當的克服了這種傾向，究竟還不能深刻的走向「生活的辨證法」的認識的路。旣然是强調的提起了「爲辨證法唯物論的創作方法而鬥爭」，那麽，我們是必須在這些地方不斷的努力！　　（二）　　在獨立評論五十一期陳衡哲的「定縣農村中見到的平敎會事業」裏，我看到如次的一節，是「保健所」的主任「王大夫的談話··」　　有一個小孩子去看眼疾，是眼上生　的毛病。王大夫呌他天天去，但他却是每三天去兩次。後來經過了一個月的施治，仍是一點效騐也没有。王大夫看他營養不夠，便問他吃的是什麽。他說，冬天吃糠皮，現在樹上發葉了，吃的是樹葉子。王大夫又問他，那掛號的兩大枚是那裏來的。他說，他家裏有三隻鷄，每三天一共下兩個蛋。他把那鷄蛋賣了方能去掛號看病，所以他祗能三天去兩次。　　這樣的事，比這更悲慘到十百倍的事，在新聞紙上，以及耳聞目見的，眞不知有多少。談政治，現在不是年頭，但說說在社會上發生的如此的事實，總相當的不至於有什麽意外吧。但是，我們很多的作家却仍舊是祗能談談「自邊瑣事」　　　　　　　　　　　　接　　了這　的作品，眞是不知人間何　」。把兩眼飛出人間，醉生夢死，所謂文學，所謂文學家，像這樣，究竟有什麽意義可言，算得什麽東西呢？答余文剪公  趙景深　　余先生··二十日自由談上你的「致趙景深先生」一文巳經看到。爲愛惜自由談的篇幅起見，許多不相干的話，暫且撇過一邊，我祗就與尊「剪」世界文學史有關的地方，給你回徐幾句··　　你說··「何以你看過了的原著者的書本，我就不許看呢？何以你引用過了的原人的材料，我就不能引用呢？」你這話是不是由衷之言？你見過原著是多大多厚麽？何以顏厚至此！試問，漢魏以來各作家的全集，至少也得有數百册，從數百册的大海中舉一勺水的例，何以你所舉的竟與我的完全一樣，甚至連批評的意見也是一字不差，好像是一個印版衷倒出來的呢？你還不承認你是文剪公麽？任何讀者只要有功夫，照我的對照表來檢查，我想没有一個人不要說你是窮賊的；你偷了北新，開明，商務，光華等書局及其著譯人的版權！此外，你所誇詡的社會說明，尤爲滑稽。你所舉的「兩漢之所以産生辭賦」，我翻遍了你的全書，找不到你的解釋。只找到一三八面第十行有這樣一名話；「中國的詩賦起於兩漢，當然不是偶然的。」究竟爲什麽不是偶然的呢？從此就没有下文。大約還當然不是偶然的「七個大字就是你的社會說明了吧？其次，你說「魏晋六朝作家之所以消極」，這完全是抄我的，竟也據爲己有，眞是厚顏！唐詩之所以特别發展」我也找不到你的解答。「宋之所以有詞，元曲之所以發生」，倒的確看到你在面七至八有這樣幾行話··　　到了宋時則有詞，詞是中國文學的特殊形式（外國没有這個東西，）這是由於中國　　商業責本始綫超越不過牠的命運，而配合了當時的兵連禍結的不安全的社會生活産生的。宋詞以外，亦有詩和散文和雜劇和傳奇；元朝却比較單純地發展着戲劇，這因爲元朝的商業資本勢力是特别大的原故。然而元朝亦傳奇，散文，詩等等。」　　這一段妙文當然是你的大作。宋朝也有雜劇和傳奇，可謂文學史上的大發現！元朝也有傳奇，也是同樣的滑稽！關於元曲之盛，你還引臧晋叔語，以爲由於以雜劇取士，其實他的話早己被人駁得不要駁了！我也曾看過曲苑等書，知道元劇之盛是由於漢人受異族壓迫，官職卑微，没有出路，便來弄劇曲，以洩不平之氣，如王　登樓一劇就是最好的表現。此外原因尚多，但决不是爲了元朝商業資本特别大，所以戲園子開得多！還有，「明淸章回小說之所以出現的原因」，也不過是引用淸人和近人的笨記罷了，現在算不得你的創見。並且你的解釋大都顯出斧鑿的痕跡，所以徒然表示出理由不充分和矛盾而己。此外如你相信李白撈月的謬說，李陵蘇武爲五言詩的起源，都可看出你的淺陋！最不應該的是你剪竊了鄭振鐸的文學大綱，還要自作聰明或掩耳盜鈴，把他的原文改錯。鄭氏原說莎孚的詩存於希臘詩選者一首，另一首是羅賽諦的；被你一删改，竟說兩首詩都是希臘詩選襄的了。至於把魯濱孫飄流記的著作年代從十八世紀提升到十六世紀（面一四○），更是意想中的錯誤。總之，上册襄的確有幾頁是你寫的，而錯誤也以你所寫的那幾頁爲最多！　　你希望方法論上的批評和批敎，我以爲你最好把你那部大著毁版，改編爲世界文學史文選，（雖然單只這名稱就很滑稽）！每篇一個題目，一一還他本來面目，依年代排列，這樣還算得光明正大，否則你這竊賊之名是不能除去的。　　更正　　昨日本刋所登落霞君之余慕陶的紙糊衛一文，第三十八行「間錯用趙景深氏和鄭氏的書····」第一「氏」字誤植爲「我」，特此更正。平凡的事（十九）  澹果孫　　劉家宅！那少尉像思索甚麽似地照樣說了一遍，「旣然你們幾位不是去上班，頂好是繞道走旁的地方走。這裡究竟不大····不大····便當···越走越不便當！」之光和那些代表們眼對眼地望着打商量，忽然又是必必八八響了五六下；於是他們不約而同地向那少尉點了頭，就旋轉了身軀，仍舊向南走····　　從彼此商議好了的結果，他們終於走到了閘北市尾的中山路上。這樣，他瘊可以先走一兩里光景的路，就由路西轉入陳家浜，到那衷去看長興廠衷那幾個留在閘北替軍隊做木工的工友；然後再回到中山路上，由北而東地轉八劉家宅。　　中山路的氣象和往常一樣，越向北走越是鄉村的··閘北的房屋，在市尾，還没有受到摩登意匠的束縛，完全守着兩層的或者一層的粉牆黑屋頂而排是比不甚密集的舊日作風，一由市尾北進，那些牆和那些屋又漸漸化而爲竹編的和草結的了，那種不甚密集的排比，也漸漸化而爲零零落落的了，這些零零落落的房屋，終於由路上散在樹木或田地之間。因此敵人是否在這一帶施過破壞行爲，之光一時也無從發見；他現在所發見的，是天空日影的灰白色，林木樹枝的紫黑色，以及麥苗散在田裡彷彿是一幅赭黄紙上點着的無數緑痕，一切都是靜的，行人，飛鳥，游行的家畜，都像是别有容身之所，僅僅乎遠處的矮屋上面浮動幾簇炊烟，可以、呌之光明白這一片平原上面還有些生命在暗中活動。可以呌之光明白自己不是向一幅圖盡上面矚目。偶爾，東北方面傳過來的淸晰的槍聲或者隱約的砲聲拂到他們的耳邊，他們就都屏息含着苦笑互相瞧了一下。這就更給之光證明了他的聽官和視官都是和現實世界相連的；然而這種現實世界究竟是一種甚麽樣的現實世界！　　之光忽然聽見人聲了，很淸晰的談話的人聲了。然而人呢？地方己經是曠野了，視官聽觸之處並看不見有人！　　於是大衆都不約而同地止步了。靜聽，細看；細看，靜聽。然後才明白那是從路東田邊的一座墳裏來的。這時候，那墳旁的一個缺口樣的東西裏面也爬出了兩個背插大刀的兵士。他們向他們端詳了一下，接著就互相招呼了一下，後來，一個兵士問··</p>

<p>春秋絲綢救國運動號  瘦鵑　　弁言我們上次出了三天中華國産絲綢專號，承諸同文珠玉紛投，給我們不少佳作，超過了我們的需要。事後再三檢讀，總覺得棄之可惜，因此趁本星期六與星期日兩天，再出一個絲綢運動號，希望國人對於絲綢救國這回事，除了舉行展覽表演遊藝以外，再做些救濟農村提倡蠶桑等實際的工作。農民截桑與國産絲綢前途  妙神　　近幾年來我國絲綢業的銷塲，眞一落千丈！這原因當然很多，求其犖犖大者，約有兩端··第一受外絲低價抛賣的影響；第二農人因絲繭賢不起錢，對着養蠶的前途，抱着無限的悲觀，相與襄足，以至出産低落。　　第一個原因，我們受外絲影響，這還屬於暫時的失敗，我們如有振興的方法和力量，便可與外絲頡頏。第二個原因，農人因絲繭不値錢，結果反而虧本，以致對於養蠶視爲畏途，並且把幾十年培植的桑樹，紛紛截去，作爲稻田，這現象與形勢，足使國産絲綢淪於萬刦不復之地，中國的絲綢業，從此一敗如灰！　　據記者所知，素以産絲着名的蘇錫一帶農民，把桑樹截去的己佔十分之二三；農民見議不遠，惟利是圖，他們忍痛把多年栽培的桑樹截去，確也有他們不得己的苦衷··我們知道農民的經濟，當裕者少，大都以今年的盈餘，作爲來年種植的資木，農民種桑，不外是自己養蠶，或自己不養蠶，把桑葉賣給别人。但是近年來因中國絲綢的不景氣，價格暴跌，絲繭不値錢，農民無利可圖，有時還要虧累些，於是誰願再去養蠶呢？蠶旣没有人養了，那末桑葉還有什麽用？農民觀望了三四年，以爲絲蠶的生意，再無振興之望，於是把無用的桑樹截去，作爲有用的稻田，倒可有些出息，作爲來年的資本，這苦難的情形，實在也難怪農民。　　記者於前月在蘇錫一帶各鄉神視察，知道農民對於養蠶的興趣，可稱淡薄到極點，並且印象也壞到極點。他們說現在養蠶，絲没有人要，桑葉也没有人要。我問何以見得絲没有人要？他們說聽說今年繭行也不開了，我告訴他們這完全是不確的事，他們說就是開，繭子也不値錢　結果虧本的多。足見現在農民對於養蠶一事，多少消極！再不謀救濟之道，養蠶將成爲大衆農民的畏途了！　　這幾年來農村的破産，政府視若無覩，農民因經濟的週轉不靈，紛紛把桑樹截去，政府也無救濟之方，坐看以農立國的大部農村，一天天的衰頽，和以絲綢嗚於世的唯一出産，打擊無餘，所以與其怪農民截桑的不該，何如責政的不去救濟的失資，來得得當。雖然，如政府着急，而人民袖手旁觀，也無濟於事，以後必須合政府與人民之力，上下合作，方有挽回這己倒的頽勢的希望。家庭主婦與國産絲綢  銀楓　　救國之道甚多，科學可以救國，航空可以救國，馬達可以救國，鐵血可以救國，甚至奬劵可以救國，娛樂也可以救國。不過現在的國病，己入膏肓，危險得不堪設想，力薄性慢的藥，决不能起死回生，卽使打幾針强心針，也是無濟於事，非有仙丹不可。上述種種的救國方法，只可當作普通藥和强心針，不能認做仙丹。「國産絲綢救國」才是仙丹。所謂「國産絲綢救國」，是要使中國人個個穿國産絲綢，不着舶來貨品。國産絲綢是本國出，本國造，全不假外人，我們費了一塊錢去買國産絲綢，這塊錢完全是本國人到手。金錢能夠不外溢，中國早己富强了。所以國産絲綢救國才是十足道地的救國仙丹。可是這服救國仙丹，要請全國家庭主婦們竭力提倡，否則所收效果難得宏大。　　家庭主婦是家政的主宰，握有無上大權。假使伊們肯擁護「國産絲綢救國」主義，竭力提倡，努力實行，不出一年，我國入超的數字，定會突然减少，外國偉大的工廠，定會大批關門。因爲每個家庭每年所費的衣服費，至少三分之一是進貢外國去。現在我們都穿國産絲綢，這個漏巵，能夠塡塞，其功不少。這個大功臣祇有家庭主婦們最有資格做。一家的衣的問題，大都要主婦解决的，從選擇衣料到製成衣服的一個階段中，絲毫没有伊的主旨，那便是例外」「反常」。伊勸丈夫穿國産絲綢，丈夫一定聽從，伊給兒童着國産絲綢，兒童一定歡喜；伊自己穿國産絲綢，還可影響及於鄒居親戚咧！所以說救國之道，在提倡服用國産絲綢；提倡‖國産絲綢救國」在家庭主婦。家庭主婦能個個提倡國産絲綢救國」，中國馬上富强。内地設立絲綢塲廠之管見  小英女士　　中國絲綢業的復興，决不在通商之地，無錫也無希望，因地價人工均貴，以内地而論，不要說起很遠，就以江南論，確實統計，丹陽南京之間·有山陂地五百餘萬畝之多··宜興慄陽一帶更不少，我們在京杭公路沿途所見，大都荒地，很宜蠶桑，這些地百之九十七八是公有，但大半爲册書地豪所據，公家若振頓之，自易明白，我們若出價買，也不過自一元至七八元一畝，則絲之成本可减至極輕，江北有無數的工人，可以利用，我們不要以非人待他們，則工作能率一定很大·　　我們要從技術上步步改良，項項注意到，從植桑到染色，均有很深的關係，爲了什麽三四十年的綿綢·能穿一世不褪色·不損壞，現在摩登的綿綢，成爲一星期的衣服，穿到第二星期，就黯然無色，儘有三五十年前留下的綢緞，遠比現行貨爲勝，我所以主張設塲廠於内地，以减輕成本，而專力於注意技術，國産絲綢才有救哩·引起西裝衣料的革命  庸子　　這些年絲綢業的不振，一部份的原因，是爲了世界經濟的衰落，一部份原因，是爲了市塲給毛織物侵佔去了。　　在下雖没有吃過絲綢廠家一頓飯，但是一日三餐，吃飽了黄糙米飯，「草堂午睡醒」，倒替絲綢業界，想得了一個「推銷國産絲綢」的「錦　妙計」，寫在下面。　　西方人穿的自然是「西裝」，「西裝」，自然是用「毛織物做的。這二句眞像「明天不下雨，必天晴」，一樣的「猶如未說。但若你不怕吃「外國火腿」，而去剥開「西裝」一看，「夾裏」和「襯衫」，十九是絲織品。呵呵，西洋人何嘗不受用「絲織品」，不過毛面慣了，不用毛織物做「面子」，像留　子的人，剃去孑　孑，似乎有些「說不出，話不出」。但是「夾裏」同「襯衫」，就顧不得許多，老實不客氣，用「絲織物了。　　「披荊斬棘」，難就難在「標新立異」的第一人。西方人明知‖絲織物」强似「毛織物」，但就難於没有肯穿了「絲織物西裝」，上街去提倡。若有人肯穿着「絲織物」做的「西裝」，上巴黎，紐約去赴夜總會，不消三天，整會絲織物西裝，風行全世界，而成爲一九ＸＸ年的摩登衣服。　　因這一種原因，我想我國的絲綢界中人，很可以請了「西式成衣」中的妙手，用「國産絲綢，替來華遊歷的西方名人，如卓别麟，范朋克，李頓，蕭伯訥等較有地位者，量了尺寸，製成西裝，每人奉送一套。他們回去時，人家一瞧，果然「嘸啥」，大家來一套，那麽，還怕絲綢業不發達麽？　　在這世界經濟衰落時期中，各國人民的購買力，自然是很薄弱，中國趁此銀價低落的好機會，把國産絲綢，運往海外去，西方人聽得價廉物美」的中國絲綢來了，與其去買高價的「毛織物」，還不如買廉價的「中國絲綢」，旣便宜，又時髦，來得合算麽？這麽一來，中國的絲綢，怕不要供不應求」了麽？　　這雖是「種起稻來煮飯」，遠水不濟近火，但是要振興中國的絲綢，我看，這倒是一個妙法。國産絲綢的科學  許宗傑　　我們總要穿衣服，那衣服的原料，不外棉織·蔴織·毛織·絲織四種。前兩種是屬於植物織維，所以抵抗力减少，不十分堅固。後兩種是屬於動物的自衛具，所以抵抗力增强，因此也堅韌耐用了。羊的毛，蠶的絲，他不怕水浸，不怕風吹，本來用以保護自己的。人類拿來做衣服，當然利用他的能力來保　身體。所以絲織品和毛織品，實是抵抗力最大而又最耐穿的東西。　　衣服與體重的比例，也有重大的關係，人類穿了體重十分之一的衣服，才能禦寒。犬貓以體重五十分之一的皮毛，卽能充分的抵禦寒冷。當然，衣服的重量大了，便有種種的損失。行路氣喘，作事不便，容易釀成鬰血症。而絲綢的重量，比任何衣料爲輕，禦寒的力量却大。一件絲棉袍子重祇二三斤，比了七八斤重的老羊皮袍子，還要温　。所以穿絲織品，輕　衞生，　種衣料所不及的。　　案外　對於人類的健康，是很重要的，不過據衛生家說··吸收過度，也正和海水浴時過　於日光中一樣的不快，而且於健康上也有害處的。人造絹及木棉，最能通過紫外線。天然絹絲和羊毛製品，吸收率最大。所以我們要調節紫外線的直射，也必須穿絲織品和毛織品。　　說起衣服，總不能忘記洗濯的事。因爲愛惜衣服而不常洗濯，那是很礙健康的。各種衣料中，最耐洗的，是天然絲。所以絲織品常常洗濯，也不易損壞。　　我們國産的絲綢，完全用天然絲製的，也合乎上邊所說的幾種條件。節儉的人，衛生的人，講經濟的人，都不妨提倡他。從國際貿易上觀察中國絲業的衰敗及其救濟  楊春綠　　我國自縲祖發明養蠶取絲的方法，卽有蠶桑之利，迄今己垂四千餘年·蠶絲出口，向爲全世界冠·惟近年以來，外受日絲人造絲的競爭，内以連所災禍的影響，不特繭量歉收，卽絲質亦不佳，以致蠶絲事業，一落千丈·民國二十年，生絲的出口，只有八千四百餘萬兩，爲近數十年來所未有；不知去年輸出生絲，僅三千二百餘萬兩，不及前年二分之一·銳减的情形如此，固出意外，殊堪痛心·爰將歷年來生絲輸出的數量與價値，列表如左··　　歷年來生絲輸出數値統計年份輸出數量（擔）輸出價値（兩）十一年一四三·四七八一三七·二一七·四九九十二年一三八·四二三一三八·九一五·一九五十三年一三一·二七三一０八·０五九·二六八十四年一六八·０一八一四０·三五七·八八０十五年一六八·五六三一四四·八二六·三五八十六年一六０·００二一二八·七０五·七三二十七年一八０·一八六一四五·四四三·四八一十八年一八九·九八０一四七·六六一·三三八十九年一五一·四二九一０九·一八一·一二四二十年一三六·一八六八四·六八０·四八二廿一年七八·一一九三二·九三二·二五０　　顧自日木絲業改良後，絲質光澤，均遠在華絲之上，歐美絲商多樂於舍此就彼·現今世界産絲之國，首推日本，占全世界産量百分之五十七，我國僅占百分之二十四，相去二倍以上·運往歐美各國，日絲年約三十萬擔，華絲僅當其六分之一·　　再加之近年人造絲的輸入，與中國絲業以一個很大的打擊·據關册統計，每年進口數量，總在十三萬擔以上·是故陳絲陳繭，積滯不銷，單就江浙兩省而言，民國二十年積存廠絲一萬六千二百三十七擔，繭十餘萬擔，約値二千餘萬兩·中國絲業的衰敗，於此可見·　　救濟辦法有二，設立蠶桑試騐塲與實行保護關稅是也··　　（一）設試騐塲我國江浙一帶，氣候睛和，土地肥沃，桑之種植旣便，育蠶更極適宜，年來所以日趨衰敝者，實因不事研究，不加改進所致·故於産絲區域，設立若干蠶桑試騐塲，聘請專家試騐，以求培育良好蠶種，改良絲質，增加産量·　　（二）關稅保護請求政府，實行保護關稅，各項生絲的出口稅之附捐，一律免微；而人造絲的進口，則科以重稅·庶幾華絲得暢銷國外，不致積滯，人造絲亦難以侵入我國市塲·如此，或能稍有轉機的希望，否則前途更不可收拾了·影響  波　　湖州是綢的産地，農人除了耕種，織綢也是他們的副業，但是也有專　織綢度日的。　　陳占風他是一個誠樸的老農，也住在湖州南門外，家中除了他的妻子外，尚有兩個兒子，一個女兒，兩個兒子在求實小學裏唸書。他家種了十來畝田，擺了二架綢機，一架是他的妻子終日辛勤地織的，尚有一架是陳古風早晚餘暇時織的，终年勤勞，一家人家倒也安安樂樂。　　近年陳古風只時時嘆氣，綢機也停了一架，尚有一架是斷續續的有時織有時停，他的大兒子問他的爸爸爲什麽天天不快活？陳古風告訴他兒子說··影響大極了，影響大極了，再不想法救濟，恐怕許多人都要不能生活了吧？　　他兒子聽了不大明白，他問··爸爸··我聽了不大懂，你把影響說給我聽聽吧！讓兒子也可知道父親心中的憂慮。　　他父親說··因爲近年來絲綢不景氣的緣故，你想；因育蠶者少，没有人要。絲行因綢價不善，少收貨色，於是，種桑者育蠶者，設繭行者，織機者，···都要間接受着大的影響，因之商業不振，農村破産！你想失業的人，一天多似一天，可怕不可怕呢？　　他兒子聽了他爸爸的一番話，他說··不錯！前天在校裏上課，恰是一課育蠶，先生說··我們中國人，老是守着舊法，不知把蠶種和育蠶的方法改良，所以鬧得農村蠶事破産，絲綢業也因爲許多摩登女子喜買洋貨，摩登靑年喜說洋話，再要執迷不悟，恐怕是不堪設想了吧！内中有一個學生立起來問··先生穿的西裝，爲什麽不用我國的絲綢做呢？先生紅了臉回說··我的西裝是一年前做的，以後就不做了。他的爸爸聽了他的話，只有唉！唉！的嘆息。</p>

<p>談言「生活的奴隸」  小之　　以前我們編輯室裏有一個兼夜工的同事，他日間在ＸＸ學會充「獨脚」幹事，據他說，他在那邊每月薪水百八十元，可是工作除了掃地抹台子泡開水三件事以外，從編譯出版一直到文書校對抄寫剪貼以及整理書櫉報紙雜誌等等都要他一手包辦的。因此我們便很同情而帶着憐憫的口吻忠告他··「日間如此辛勞疲乏地幹那沉重的工作，晚上是極需要充分的安靜的休息···」我們還責問他··「·····爲甚麽又把自己唯一的安息的時間挪用到這裏來而要絞上三小時的腦汁呢？要這些錢幹什麽？···」最後我們又似乎很關切地警告他··「像這樣牛馬的幹法，人是不經幹的」！但出乎我們意外的他的充血的白眼珠澎湃得將要爆裂，他的憤忿簡短的答話是··「這有甚麽辦法？我巳是做了生活的奴隸！」　　又比如說，自己本來最不會寫文章而且最不愛寫文章，但爲了「肚皮」　好聽些，說是「生活」，好在嘴巴裏還能夠不相干的哼兩句，於是也不論寫的像阿貓或是像阿狗，只是日夜拚了性命的寫；然而這究竟是爲着「肚皮」的條件而逼出來的東西，其好壞當然可以想見，所以送出去的稿子十篇就有七八篇做了字紙簍裏的俘虜，可是爲了「肚皮」，還不是仍然要日夜不斷地拚了性命的寫？因此，朋友們有的便在說，「他太可憐了！」有的却在笑，「生活的奴隸！」「時代的落伍者」！　　還記得在不久以前，報上本埠新聞裏載着，「小闆三」搶飯互毆斃命的事；昨天本報又載「兩馬夫本係好友，爭生意惡鬥出命案」的新聞。像這樣的事，當然要給高等的人拍桌大駡的「生活的奴隸！不出息不要臉的齷齪東西！」　　其實，這些，都是不相干的，人要生活，誰可以不吃飯？肚皮不得飽，當然就本能地出發去找所以能飽肚皮的事幹，不過在這大羣之中，有的觀點錯誤没有主義的弱者或是抱着個人英雄主義的野心家，便給好些莫明其妙的所謂「「工作至上主義」「讀書至上主義」以及好些「至上」的高等的人笑駡他們是「生活的奴隸，時代的落伍者」了；而另外的好些好些、都被判决成了土匪，强盜！······我在此不欲多講，我只問··「工作至上」「讀書至上」以及好些其他的「至上」，我們能不能把它們拿來放在嘴巴裏當飯嚼？能不能呑在肚皮裏養生命？「土匪」「强盜」以至於洪水猛獸，這究竟是在怎樣一個方式下形成出來的？·····我有些懷疑··而好些人更是莫明其妙！金絲籠中的百靈  蘋　　「姑娘醒來啦！」一個老婦人像等候了半天似的探進頭來。　　這間並不寛大的臥房，裝飾却很美麗，祇要你站在馬路上，仰起頭來，望見這室内的天花板上的一角，或者那圖案的窗飾，就能想像這室内的女主人是劃地爲牢　　停战协定你不准走出來！長城綫怎樣美麗的一位始娘！她己從床上半坐起身來，一頭鳥雲似的靑絲披在背後，襯在雪白的枕套上，或者我們要想起神話中的天女的類。她没有回老婦人話，舉起兩條藕也似的肉臂，打着呵欠，一列白潔的貝齒就顯示在我們面前。姑娘是那樣地乏力，似乎没有睡醒一般，但是床頭小凡上女神手中的金色小鐘鏜打了四下，她無可奈何的掀起被窩，跳出身來，綢質睡衣内的肉體，是那樣地迷人，姑娘自己也不自覺的對鏡痴立了一會，可愛的兩顆酒窩己在鏡中笑着哩；姑娘就像逃避什麽似向後房去了。　　姑娘的後房，除了那老婦人之外，就是讀者還没有見過面的王先生，也没有進去過。據老婦人告訴說，一間普通的化妝室而己；我們就不必偵探那神秘的後房。你們看哪，姑娘己換了一個人出來了。　　姑娘的秀髮，己不再那樣蓬亂，像波浪一樣有秩序地披在腦後，面上薄施脂粉，淸幽出俗，讀者或者不信姑娘的化妝術吧？這就是姑娘的後房不能公開的緣故。寢衣也換上了一襲時式的新裝　　不瞞讀者諸君說，我委實呌不出那是什麽料子。姑娘坐上就近的安樂椅，在高貴的烟盒中，取了一支細小的香烟，燃着後，她悠閑地望着從自己櫻唇中吹出來的烟圈，漸漸擴大，消散，像一個藝術的賞覽者。　　我們的老婦人又出玩啦，她附近姑娘的耳朶，說話是那末輕，如其你們太不留意，一定被那老婦人瞞過的。她說的是│王先生喊你早點回來。　　姑娘的雙眉鎖緊了，她丢了很長的烟尾，走到窗前來，一對不知名的小鳥正啁啾着從窗前飛過。牠們自由歡樂。姑娘似乎想起了自己，像一隻金絲籠裏的百靈，可是那小鐘太不識趣，己是六點鐘了。於是我們的姑娘在這問美麗的臥房中消逝；讀者請你們緊隨着我，我告訴你們姑娘的去處。　　那是個怪好玩的塲化，跳舞塲這名稱很熟悉吧。我們的姑娘就是這跳舞塲裏的皇后，她踏進這爵士的歌聲中，己被高貴的紳士們圍上了，姑娘點頭微笑，熟練的交際，投身在一個靑年懷中在光滑的地板上旋轉起來。　　今天的茶舞會，參加的紳士們都爲了瞻仰皇后的風采而來的。每一次的音樂聲起，姑娘己被包圍的人羣中一個攫爲己有了。讀者諸君，你們看淸楚了嗎，我們美麗的姑娘，是每天過着這樣的生活，她好像爲了人們的摟抱而生的；然而····　　十點鐘到啦，姑娘再不能跳下去了，她没有一分鐘休息過，她的胸脯是起伏的呼吸着·在某一次電燈熄的時候，我們的姑娘不見子；但是無論如何，姑娘逃不過我的耳目，我跟着她再到美麗的臥房，王先生眞再討厭没有，在臥房背後偷了姑娘的一個吻，姑娘却不在意的跑進後房去，我彷彿聽見後房的關門聲。　　讀者諸君，我現在要介紹這位王先生和你門見面了····什麽？他們的電燈熄啦，我什麽也瞧不見，你們呢？那金絲籠中的百靈啊！店員通訊目光如豆的商人　　編者先生··我現在有個問題，要請你指敎；但</p>

<h3>Feng's Troops Actively Deploy Defenses Between Zhangjiakou and Xuanhua</h3>
<p>The Ping Authorities Show No Response to the Chahar Situation</p>
<p>Awaiting the Lushan Conference to Decide on a Solution</p>
<p>A Soviet Ambassador Denies Aiding Feng's Troops</p>
<p>(Beiping) Ji Hongchang's troops and others, under Feng's orders, are gathering near Zhangjiakou. From Duolun to Dushikou, they are assigned to Liu Guitang for defense. Fang Zhenwu's troops are gathering near Xuanhua, and Sun Liangcheng's troops are deployed along the Ping-Sui Railway south of Xuanhua. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Zhangjiakou telegram: The Ji troops withdrawn from Duolun have mostly reached Zhangbei. A portion, about 2,000, remains in Guyuan, mixed with righteous soldiers. Guyuan is facing a shortage of food and salt due to repeated battles and the passage of large armies. Residents and young men are being conscripted as soldiers. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The authorities here have shown no response to the Chahar situation except for telegraphing the central government and Chiang for instructions. The Chahar situation must await the Lushan Conference to decide on a solution. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Chahar situation is awaiting the central government's final decision. The Ping authorities are proceeding according to the central government's instructions. Various parties still hope that Feng will realize his errors and awaken. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Although a peaceful resolution of the Chahar situation is unlikely, the authorities are still hoping for peace. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Due to strict inspections along the Ping-Sui Railway in recent days, the locomotives of passenger trains passing through Datong and Zhangjiakou are often detached, causing significant delays. The second train, scheduled to arrive in Ping yesterday at 3:00 PM, only departed from Shacheng around 11:00 AM today. If there are no further delays, it may arrive in Ping at 6:00 PM this evening. The first train, scheduled to depart from Ping at 11:10 AM this morning, has not sold tickets due to a shortage of carriages. Ticket sales will commence upon the arrival of the second train. There has been no report from the station regarding the Ping-Baotou express train scheduled to arrive today. The railway has issued a notice that all northbound freight trains are suspended. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Feng's recapture of Duolun was not a dramatic battle. Ji Hongchang did not leave Zhangbei. It was entirely Liu Guitang's operation. Liu now has about 10,000 infantry, cavalry, and bandit troops. His planned strategy was to first have Deng Wen and others withdraw from Kangbao, Baochang, and Guyuan, and then have Liu send troops to occupy them, declaring a revolt. At the same time, he has a secret agreement with the puppet army of Li Shouxin. Liu advances as Li retreats, in order to complete Feng's plan to recover lost territory and defend Chahar Province. Li Shouxin's and Cui Xingwu's troops, long unwelcome by the Japanese puppets, will also reportedly declare a revolt after withdrawing from Duolun. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Soviet Ambassador has issued a solemn denial regarding recent reports that the Soviet government is aiding General Feng Yuxiang. In this denial, he strongly asserted that such provocative rumors are systematically fabricated by the Japanese intelligence department in Tianjin and copied by the Chinese intelligence department in Beiping. (20th TASS Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Ping-Sui Railway has stopped running freight trains today, but passenger trains are still running to and from Ping, though with many delays. (21st Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to Chinese sources, Feng Yuxiang is now seeking peace again. It is generally believed that the authorities here must await the conclusion of the Kuling Conference to decide on severe actions against Feng. (21st Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Establishment of the North China War Zone Relief Committee</h3>
<p>Yu Xuezhong Arrives in Ping from Tianjin to Participate</p>
<p>(Beiping) The North China War Zone Relief Committee was established at 9:00 AM this morning at the Political Reorganization Council. The chairman and vice-chairman, Huang Fu and Yu Xuezhong, and committee members Zhou Zuomin, Tao Menghe, Zhang Boling, Tang Erhe, and 16 others were present. Huang Fu stated in his address that the first step to stabilizing North China is to strive for a ceasefire, and the second step is to provide relief to the war zone. He said that 5 million in relief funds is already secured. It was decided that the committee would be divided into three groups: agricultural relief, emergency relief, and finance. The full committee will meet once a month, and special meetings will be convened when necessary. After the meeting, Huang hosted a banquet at the Yanbin Hotel for the committee members and the banking community of Pingjin (Beiping-Tianjin). Starting at 2:00 PM, the three groups held separate meetings to discuss their respective tasks and to elect their directors. The meetings adjourned at 6:00 PM. Zhang Yuanshan was appointed director of the agricultural relief group, Yu Xuezhong of the emergency relief group, and Ka Baimei of the finance group. From now on, all work of the committee will be carried out separately by each group. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Yu Xuezhong arrived in Ping this morning on a special train with Wei Jian and over 20 staff and soldiers. After disembarking, Yu went to the former Ministry of Foreign Affairs to participate in the inaugural meeting of the War Zone Relief Committee. He returned to Tianjin in the same train at 8:00 PM that evening. Lu Muting came to Ping last night. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Yu Xuezhong said that he had received repeated telegrams from Chiang summoning him to Lushan to participate in the conference. He intends to make a substantial report on the military and political affairs of Hebei. He came to Ping today to participate in the War Zone Relief Committee and will return to Tianjin tonight. After making some arrangements, he will depart south. He plans to entrust the affairs of the provincial government to Wei Jian, the Director of the Department of Civil Affairs, and the affairs of the municipal government to Councilor Wang Tao. The affairs of the First Army Corps will be entrusted to Chief of Staff Liu Zhonggan. He expects to return to Tianjin in about ten days. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The North China War Zone Relief Committee, consisting of seventeen members, held its inaugural ceremony this morning, chaired by Huang Fu. He Yingqin, despite his illness, attended the meeting as a representative of the government and administered the oath of office to the committee members. The committee has already received one million yuan remitted from Nanjing and will issue four million yuan in public bonds in North China to fund relief efforts. (21st Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The North China War Zone Relief Committee has been established, divided into emergency relief and agricultural relief. Currently, emergency relief will be prioritized to restore the original state of the localities. The Executive Yuan has approved one million yuan for relief, which is expected to be remitted tomorrow or the day after. In addition, the Hebei provincial government will issue four million yuan in public bonds, with the salt tax surcharge as collateral. The regulations have been drafted and are expected to be approved at the Executive Yuan meeting next week. (21st Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Beiping) The problem of the puppet troops has been completely resolved. Disbandment and reorganization will begin on the 21st, and the war zone will also begin the takeover simultaneously. The takeover is expected to be completed within this month. The Tangshan negotiations involved representatives from Ping and Tang making five trips back and forth. The puppet troops initially demanded at least 480,000 for disbandment and reorganization costs, but this has now been finalized at 340,000. It is planned to incorporate 4,000 and disband 6,000 out of a force of 10,000. During the period of incorporation, if funding from a certain party is cut off, we will subsidize it. The current month's salary is 8,000 yuan. A portion of the disbandment and reorganization funds has already been remitted from Tianjin to Tangshan. The military and political authorities of Ping have jointly raised an additional 300,000, which Yin Tong will bring there soon. The puppet troops requested six months for the disbandment period, but we only allowed two months. It is planned to complete the reorganization within two months. However, the internal situation of the puppet troops is extremely complex, as they are scattered in more than ten locations. They are currently being concentrated, preparing for verification. It is still difficult to predict whether the reorganization can be completed within two months. Regarding the title of Li Jichun, Li stated that he is Chinese and that as long as he can come down from the stage, he does not care about the title. Shi Yousan's troops are currently on Qinhuangdao, totaling about 900, with 500 armed and 400 unarmed. Negotiations are underway for incorporation. Once there is progress, they will be transferred to Yutian concentration point for reorganization. The remaining officers and soldiers will be sent to the Beining Road in Shandong to facilitate the opening of traffic. After Shi's troops are transferred to Yutian, traffic can be restored. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) An agreement has largely been reached on the issue of incorporating the puppet troops. The takeover of the counties in the Luanhe area of northeast Beiping war zone has been decided to begin on the 23rd, and it is expected to be completed within this month. Because the takeover procedures have been negotiated and decided with Li Jichun, if there are no unforeseen problems, the county magistrates will proceed to handle it themselves. The takeover commissioners Yin Tong, Tao Shangming, etc., will not accompany them initially. They will provide assistance at any time if necessary negotiations arise. Liu Shisun is currently conducting negotiations in Qinhuangdao with Shi Yousan's Chief of Staff Hu regarding the incorporation of Shi's troops. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Political Reorganization Council received a telegram from Liu Shihao stating that he had contacted the magistrates of Luyu and Linuyu counties regarding the takeover event. Everything is ready in Luyu, and he has telegraphed Chairman Yin and the county magistrate to quickly lead the police to Luyu to take over. The takeover of the telegraph and telephone bureaus along the Tangshan, Luanzhou, Changli, Linyu, and Qinhuangdao lines has also been completed by the commissioner Peng specially appointed by the Ministry of Communications. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Shunyi telegram: At 10:00 AM yesterday, a Japanese aircraft flew from the northwest to the sky above the county town, circled once, and flew east. The situation in Niulanshan and the Sixth District is the same as before. Lutai telegram: The puppet troops along the railway line east of Lutai and west of Tang territory began to concentrate in Tangshan several days ago. Currently, except for a small number of garrison troops, most will be gradually withdrawn. The puppet troops in Ninghe have also begun to move east. A small number of troops are still stationed in the city and have not been withdrawn. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Xue Zhiheng and Lei Shourong telegraphed Yin Tong from Tangshan on the 21st evening, urging the payment of funds, stating that the disbandment deadline was not a problem. Yin consulted with members Yu and Tao on the 22nd morning. If it is not possible to handle it in the morning, it will be necessary to remit on the 24th. The county magistrates and public security bureau chiefs are scheduled to depart on the 24th. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Yu said that there has been progress in the reorganization of the puppet troops. It is decided that starting on the 23rd, the Public Security Bureau Chief of Tangshan, Song Diqian, and others will lead the public security personnel from the nearby counties to the counties. The county magistrates are scheduled to depart on different routes on the 25th to take over. 150,000 of the puppet troop reorganization funds have already been remitted to Tangshan yesterday, including designated funds for the reorganization of 600 soldiers at 20 yuan each, and 300 officers at 100 yuan each. Another 25,000 yuan has been allocated for living expenses for this month. Li Jichun is scheduled to begin the reorganization near Tangshan on the 23rd. Shi Yousan has left Qinhuangdao. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Yin Tong told reporters that the Political Reorganization Council has no objection to the funds for the reorganization and post-reorganization arrangements for Li's troops, and the private advances, as agreed upon in Tangshan. Li's title is Chairman of the Disbandment and Reorganization Committee, not Chairman of the Reorganization Committee, because the reorganization time cannot be too long, so it is hoped that it will be completed within two months. Yesterday afternoon, a telegram was sent to Tangshan, asking members Lei and Xue to convey this. As of 3:00 PM today, there was no reply, fearing that there are still objections. The only thing Li is arguing about at the moment is this point. If this point is resolved, the funds will be remitted immediately, and the reorganization will be implemented. Member Liu Shisun, together with Major Ohashi, a staff officer of the Japanese garrison in Tianjin, went to Qinhuangdao to negotiate with Shi Yousan's troops. Shi has escaped the vortex and handed over responsibility to someone named Hu, so the process is proceeding very smoothly. We recognize 1,000 men, and vehicles have been prepared on the Beining Road since the 22nd to transport them to Tangshan, where they will gather in Yutian, awaiting verification and distribution of supplies. After the Li's troops' matter is completed, the Hebei provincial government will formally incorporate them. Liu and Da will return to Tianjin on the 24th or 25th. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The 484,000 yuan in reorganization funds was the earliest demand made by Li. As a result of negotiations, it was finally decided to be 300,000 yuan. As for the 4,000 men who will be retained, based on the statistics for the current month's salary, about 48,000 yuan will be needed, totaling 348,000 yuan. It is planned to issue a reorganization fee of 20 yuan to each of the 6,000 men being disbanded, totaling 120,000 yuan, and 100 yuan to each of the 300 officers, totaling 30,000 yuan, totaling 150,000 yuan. It is rumored that 25,000 yuan for the current month's living expenses will be issued after arriving in Tangshan, and the reorganization will begin starting the day after tomorrow. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The authorities here originally planned to begin taking over the counties east of the Luanhe River today, but Li Jichun suddenly increased the amount of reorganization funds he demanded from 300,000 yuan to 480,000 yuan. After continued negotiations, they agreed to pay him 350,000 yuan. The Chinese authorities hope to be able to take over three of the eighteen counties occupied by the Japanese army by the 23rd of this month, and several counties each day thereafter, so that all counties can be recovered by the end of this month. However, the responsible parties believe that this move seems likely to prolong the process. (21st Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Sun Dianying Goes to Baotou</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Sun Dianying telegraphed his office in Ping this morning, saying that he is scheduled to travel to Baotou by train from Chaigoubu today. The rear of his troops already departed from Xinzhuangzi on foot to Huaian yesterday. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Lanzhou telegram: The Gansu-Suiyuan Provincial Government held a meeting to discuss the issue of Sun Dianying's Tuntian Army passing through Qinghai. The resolutions were: (1) The counties should provide supplies for Sun's army as it passes through, and the army will pay the price. (2) The army should proceed continuously during transit and maintain military discipline. (3) Prior contact should be made regarding the route to Lanzhou or Gansu into Qinghai. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Sun Dianying telegraphed his army representatives Hu Jiesan, Wang Shi, Xu et al. today, reporting that he had taken a military train to Baotou. Sun has appointed Deputy Army Commander Yu Shiming and senior staff officer Li Ming of the Military and Political Department to Chaigoubu to handle everything. The transportation should be completed within days. Sun previously telegraphed Zhang Zhenting and Hu Jiesan, negotiating for the allowance for August and September. The military sub-committee issued half a month's allowance for August last night, totaling 60,000, which has been claimed by the army office. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Wang Jingwei and Others Travel by Ship to Jiangxi to Attend the Lushan Conference</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Chiang summoned a conference in Lushan to discuss military and political issues and telegraphed Wang, president of the Executive Yuan, to participate. After receiving the telegram, Wang, due to the many complex political affairs in Nanjing, did not depart until 11:30 AM this morning on the Ninghai warship. Those accompanying him included Tie Gu, Hai Chen, and Zhu of the Ministry of Railways, and Tie's deputy Zeng Zhongming. Wang's wife, Chen Bijun, and Zeng Zhongming's wife also departed earlier on a China National Aviation Corporation plane. According to Wang before his departure, he is going to Lushan at Chiang's invitation to discuss and resolve various important current issues, and he will return to Nanjing in a few days. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to reliable sources in Lushan, this conference will not take any specific form. Rather, key military and political figures will simply meet to discuss their respective responsibilities in Lushan. Regarding the more important current issues, such as those relating to Sichuan, Xinjiang, the aftermath of the situation in North China, and how to deal with Feng in Chahar, everyone will agree on a unified viewpoint from the military and political sides, and then submit it to the Central Political Council for a decision. It is expected that after the meeting, there will be some supplements to the provincial governments of several provinces. As for Huang Fu, he will also pass through Nanjing to Lushan in the coming days to report on the progress of the takeover of the war zone and to present a detailed plan for the reorganization of political affairs in North China. It is rumored that the Lushan conference will not have a specific format for when to hold group review meetings or plenary sessions. The final consultation is expected to be around the 25th. (21st Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Qingdao Mayor Shen Honglie to Return to His Post</h3>
<p>Shen Has Already Gone from Weihai to Yantai</p>
<p>(Qingdao) Representatives who went to Weihai telegraphed that Mayor Shen has agreed to return to Qingdao and will arrive at 6:30 PM on the 22nd. Upon hearing the news, all sectors of the city are preparing a warm welcome. In addition to the staff of the municipal government bureaus and agencies, as well as more than 140 groups in the city, there will also be the poor people of Mahuwo and Nuozhuang, and all the staff of the Shanghai National Products Traveling Troupe. It is expected to be a grand occasion. It is also heard that Shen is leaving Weihai for Yantai today. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Shen Honglie's representative, Hu Jiafeng, was summoned to Jiangxi by Chiang, who inquired about the Qingdao situation. After this matter was completed, he left Jiangxi and arrived in Nanjing. According to reports, Chiang Kai-shek paid unusual attention to the Qingdao situation, especially Shen's departure from Qingdao and resignation as mayor. He was very concerned and issued a telegram to Shen, expressing his intention to retain him, hoping that he would endure the pain temporarily and that the central government would eventually have a satisfactory solution to the three escaping warships. Hu immediately telegraphed Shen according to his instructions, but Shen replied again, still expressing his negativity due to the excessive stimulation. Chiang Kai-shek is still planning to urge Shen to return to his post. Hu did not stay long in Nanjing and went north to meet Shen and report. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Qingdao) Mayor Shen Honglie will return here at 6:00 PM tomorrow evening. Various groups are now preparing a warm welcome for him.

If there is a convenient ship in Yantai, he plans to return to Qingdao by sea. (21st Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Military Tensions Rise in Sichuan as Tibetan Troops Invade Xikang</h3>
<p>The Dalai Lama Has International Backing</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Sichuan office in Nanjing received a telegram from Sichuan stating that Tibetan troops dispatched by the Dalai Lama in Xikang have taken advantage of the recent resumption of fighting in Sichuan. Although Liu Wenhui has withdrawn from Chengdu, the fighting in the Meijiang area is intense. The summer thaw of cold snow makes it easier for Tibetan troops to march, and they are seizing the opportunity to launch a large-scale invasion. The troops of Liu Yuanzhang, originally dispatched by Liu Wenhui to Xikang, are feeling their forces are weak and have repeatedly telegraphed for reinforcements. Liu Wenhui is unable to provide reinforcements due to the urgent situation in Sichuan. Dege and other places are about to be occupied by the Tibetan army. It is rumored that the Dalai Lama is relying on a certain country for assistance and has transported a large amount of funds and weapons, with the aim of occupying Xikang, Qinghai, and Tibet and organizing a puppet state.

<h3>Huang Musong Can Return to Nanjing in Days</h3>

<p>Gong and Peng to Depart on Schedule</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The office of the Commissioner of New Frontier reported that the plane to pick up Huang has flown to Dihua. If there are no changes, Huang can return to Nanjing the day after tomorrow. Peng Zhaoxian and Gong Bicheng, the special commissioners of the Xinjiang Provincial Party Affairs, have decided to take the plane west from Nanjing on the 25th, as the Eurasia plane can still reach Dihua directly, and there is no obstruction en route. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Ma Zhongying declared a counterattack on Dihua, and Sheng Shicai went to the front to supervise the battle. Liu Wenhui is stationed in the provincial capital. There are many White Russians in Ma's troops, and they are colluding with Mongolian bandits, issuing absurd declarations. Yang Qutong inspected the Longdong troops, and Yang's brigade will be expanded into a division. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Liu Xiang Has Arrived in Chengdu</h3>
<p>Generals to Confer on Bandit Suppression Measures</p>
<p>(Chengdu) Liu Xiang, who previously departed from Longchang for the province, did not arrive in the province until the 21st due to delays along the way. The entire model division also arrived with him. He appointed Liao Haitao, the deputy division commander, to temporarily serve as the Chengdu Garrison Commander. (21st Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Chengdu) Tian Songyao, in response to Deng Xihou's telegram invitation, came to Chengdu to meet Liu Xiang. He is scheduled to arrive in the province on the 22nd. A generals' conference will be held in the coming days to discuss the distribution of bandit suppression forces and joint suppression measures. (21st Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Chengdu) Liu Xiang plans to assume his new position as Commander-in-Chief of Bandit Suppression in the coming days. (21st Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) The new seal of office and commission of appointment for Liu Xiang as Commander-in-Chief of Bandit Suppression in Sichuan, issued by the central government, arrived in Chongqing on the 20th and will soon be transported to the province. (21st Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) Liu Xiang believes that the military affairs in Anchuan are coming to an end. He has instructed the staff and confidential sections to plan for bandit suppression funds and ammunition, and intends to select the most elite troops from each army, ten or eight brigades, as the vanguard for bandit suppression, and form another ten brigades as a rear support team, launching a large-scale attack to wipe out the bandits in one fell swoop. If Liu Wenhui's troops can obey orders, they will also be treated equally. (21st Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Chengdu) After Deng's army captured Chongning, the 24th Army became increasingly alarmed, with no fighting spirit. Liu Wenhui has ordered them to withdraw entirely to the west bank of the Minjiang River. Liu Xiang, believing that the war is coming to an end, is discussing with the generals to allocate a large portion of the troops to assist in bandit suppression, as well as issues concerning allowances, ammunition, and transportation. (21st Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Liu Wenhui telegraphed Wang and Chiang on the 18th, stating that the Yu army was pressing hard on the Minjiang River with all its strength. Division Commander Xia Shouxun reported that the Yu army launched a large-scale crossing to Jiading, Meizhou, and Pengshan from midnight on the 17th to dawn on the 18th, with artillery fire filling the sky. Our army resisted defensively, and after a fierce battle, sank countless boats and rafts before retreating to the other shore. It seems that he is resisting the central government, and in addition to ordering his subordinates to defend the river to the death, he is reporting this to the central government. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) A representative of the Sichuan army said that Liu Wenhui retreated from Chengdu to defend the Minjiang River and was repeatedly attacked by various armies. It is difficult to defend. It is heard that a part of his troops will retreat into Xikang, and another part will flee into Yunnan. Liu Xiang is concerned that he will still leave future troubles and advocates taking the opportunity to reduce his military power. If he still does not realize his errors, he will continue to pursue him. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<h3>The London Times Discusses Our Cooperation with the League of Nations</h3>
<p>Still Alleviating Japanese Suspicions</p>
<p>(London) The London Times commented today on the Chinese Committee held in Paris on July 18, stating that the only reason Japan and Russia did not attend was that both countries are currently not members of the League of Nations. However, the committee will not completely disregard their position and interests, as it is not the duty of the committee to enhance the interests of any one country or any number of countries. The existence of the committee is only to coordinate the work of various technical advisors employed by the Chinese government. Although China is plagued by bandits and hindered by warlords, it is still making progress and can at least maintain its credit, which is stronger than most debtor nations, which is commendable. The Times praised the achievements of Song Ziwen and Chiang Kai-shek and said that the appointment of Lehman as a representative to China to coordinate technical advisory work for a period of one year is a commendable appointment. The Japanese may not be without suspicion of this appointment, but Lehman's current position has nothing to do with politics. It is hoped that the efforts of British member Sattar and French expert Momet of the Economic Advisory Board to China at the invitation of Song Ziwen will not conflict with the direct representatives of the League of Nations. (21st Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Song Ziwen Arrives in Berlin</h3>

Those participating in the talks will include Bei Songsun, manager of the Bank of China in Shanghai, Wei Wenbin, secretary of the Ministry of Finance, Hu Shize, Chinese Minister to Switzerland, and Yang Guangzhu, Consul General in London. According to the Hamburg Freie Presse, Song Ziwen will strive to make Germany feel interested in China's economic construction during his talks in Berlin, and will then go to Hamburg for a visit.

<h3>Luo Wen'gan Discusses the Future of Sino-Soviet Diplomatic Relations</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Someone met with Luo Wen'gan and asked if there had been any new developments in Sino-Soviet diplomatic relations, which had been strained since the issue of selling the Chinese Eastern Railway arose. Luo smiled and replied, "The strain is there, and whether there are new developments depends on them. Today, the Soviet-puppet railway sale conference is intermittent. The Soviet government has clearly been in a disadvantageous position. If the Soviet Union immediately realizes this, cancels the sale agreement, and respects our national sovereignty, then Sino-Soviet diplomatic relations will be like old friends reuniting, harmonious as before. It all depends on the Soviet Union's good handling of it." (21st Dispatch)</p>
<h3>The Mexican Anti-Chinese Case</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Luo Wen'gan said that the government originally intended to send Li Jinlun and others to form an investigation team to go to Mexico for the anti-Chinese case. However, the inside story of this case is extremely complicated, and it is not possible for two or three people to thoroughly understand it in a short period of time. This idea has become a thing of the past. In order to enhance Sino-Mexican diplomatic relations, the government plans to send a full-time minister to investigate the truth of the case, and to contact the Mexican government so that it can respond at any time, in order to avoid this unfortunate incident from happening again.

Shi Yancheng's address stated that amidst internal and external troubles, they should improve politics and open a path to survival. Huang Shaoxiong's address said that they must establish confidence so that the people believe in the government. He Chengjun hoped to eliminate illegal donations and taxes, reduce the burden on the people, and cooperate with the commanders of various armies to suppress the Red bandits. Zeng Qingxi, Fang Benren, and Wang Xinggong successively offered kind words. Finally, Zhang Qun replied, saying that political measures are not in words but in actions, and should be effective. In the future, he will definitely find ways to stabilize the countryside and then seek economic construction. (21st Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>The Reality After the World Economic Conference Closed</h3>
<p>This World Economic Conference gathered over 1,500 representatives from 66 countries in London. Political leaders, diplomatic celebrities, and academic experts were all famous figures from around the world. It can be said to have been the largest international gathering since the Treaty of Versailles. At that time, the representatives attending the meeting were all full of hope, believing that the economic conference would definitely open up the current difficult situation and save the economic crisis that had spread throughout the world. However, no one expected that on the third day of the meeting, unpleasant feelings would arise between Britain and the United States due to the war debt issue. The situation at the meeting suddenly became uneasy. As a result, political issues were put aside. The German Hugenberg's proposal to attack the Soviet Union had become a thing of the past. Talk of recovering colonies was also just empty words. Even the issue of currency stabilization, which was closely related to the economic panic and was originally the most important item on the agenda proposed at the Lausanne Conference last year, could not be resolved due to the United States' eagerness to raise domestic prices and its refusal to abandon its currency expansion policy, resulting in a serious confrontation between gold standard countries such as France, Belgium, Switzerland, and the Netherlands and non-gold standard countries such as the United States, Britain, and Japan. In Britain and Japan, which had abandoned the gold standard for a long time, the domestic markets had gradually stabilized, and international exchange rates were relatively stable, they could express their support for France's advocacy of currency stability but could not help but be suspicious of the United States' economic nationalism. Therefore, after forty days of the meeting, political relations had not been improved through clever diplomatic language, and the hope of reviving the economy was very slim. As a result, the idea of an indefinite adjournment had to be put into practice.</p>
<p>So, what will be the result if all countries vigorously implement nationalism, adopt blockade policies, and strive for economic self-sufficiency? France is one of the largest treasuries in the world today. Its cash reserves account for 98% of the total currency in circulation. In order to maintain its financial dominance in Europe and safeguard its interests in recovering foreign investment, it has to maintain its gold standard even though general prices have fallen by 22% compared to 1914. Even if foreign trade cannot be developed for a while, it can be satisfied if it can maintain the status quo. As for the unemployment problem, official statistics show 310,000 people. Although this only refers to those who are receiving government relief and are recognized as unemployed, it is feared that it will not exceed one million at most. Therefore, France's difficulties may be temporarily overcome by historical resistance, but the brewing of this economic panic will inevitably be affected by the devaluation of currencies by Britain, the United States, Japan, and other countries, and it will have to use higher tariffs as the most effective weapon. This is why the economic crisis still exists. The main significance of American nationalism lies in raising prices and stimulating the rise of industry. However, the consumer market is small, and the increase in domestic consumption power is less than one-fifth of the increase in the production index. Therefore, if the United States wants to solve the employment problem of 12 million unemployed workers, it must engage in non-productive military industries to seek remedy. Britain's conservative policy is to actively expand the economic alliance within the British Empire to seek its domestic self-sufficiency. This method may be okay to relieve the immediate crisis, but it is not dare to be certain whether it can be used to overcome the world's panic and reverse the current misfortune. As for Japan's rampant behavior in East Asia, trying to use the power of airplanes and cannons to dominate the economy and using purely consumer military industries to stimulate the economy, whether it is helpful to the facts is something that anyone with a little economic common sense can know. If we look at Japan's budget deficits over the years, which are entirely dependent on public debt to make up for them, excessive exploitation, even with the strong pressure of the warlords, can be granted and demanded, but it cannot help its national and social poverty and the deterioration of general social thought. In the past three years, more than 8,000 people have been arrested and imprisoned due to political relations, which shows its internal turmoil.</p>
<p>Since European and American countries could not find a common point of cooperation at the World Economic Conference, and economic recovery cannot be effective by closing the country, it is difficult to predict how the world situation will evolve after the meeting. However, China's market is the best consumer market for capitalist countries and is a must-have for all countries in the world to solve their economic difficulties. Whether it is joint management or independent competition in the future, it will not be easy for our country to deal with it. What strategies will we have to protect ourselves?</p>
<h3>London Conference Resumes Indefinitely, International Economic War Will Intensify</h3>
<p>The United States Proposes a Free Trade Draft</p>
<p>Supplementing the Existing Tariff Truce</p>
<p>Economic Committee Held a General Meeting Yesterday</p>
<p>Considering the Reports of Various Subcommittees</p>
<p>(London) The issue of trade barriers has revived today. US Secretary of State Hull suddenly proposed a truce on international trade restrictions to supplement the existing tariff truce. (National Telegram, 21st)</p>
<p>(London) At the general economic conference this afternoon at 4:00 PM, a report of 34 pages will be considered, containing the reports of various shareholders' meetings and related to basic issues such as commercial policy, export bonuses, commodity origin identification, and production cooperation. Rapporteur Rensiman stated that, according to the debate, all countries unanimously recognized that reducing excessive tax rates was absolutely necessary. Therefore, there is reason to hope that once the special circumstances that may lead to the adjournment of the conference are eliminated, a gradual reduction of economic obstacles can be initiated along international boundaries. The representatives certainly did not hope to obtain practical agreements on the various products under consideration in a short period of time, but the important results that usually take several years to achieve have mostly been found.</p>
<p>After the plenary session opened, Curien read out the US proposal, hoping that governments would propose practical measures through diplomatic and other channels during the recess to try to implement the purpose of convening the conference. At the same time, the United States suggested extending the tariff truce with more precise conditions than the existing ones. (Reuter's Telegram, 21st)</p>
<p>(London) No one is willing to predict the date of the reconvening of the World Economic Conference. However, it is believed that the permanent foreign agency after the extension of the conference will be a meeting of major ambassadors, following the ambassadorial meeting method adopted after the war to monitor the implementation of the peace treaty. At the same time, the general opinion is that the temporary failure of the conference will have the effect that the conference originally wanted to eliminate. What is this effect? The intensification of nationalistic economic warfare. (Reuter's Telegram, 21st)</p>
<h3>Full Text of the Monetary Subcommittees' Report Published</h3>
<p>(London) The full text of the reports of the two subcommittees of the Economic Conference's Monetary Committee, one focusing on short-term solutions and the other on long-term solutions, was published this morning. These two reports are limited to describing the details of the work and listing the various resolutions that have been voted on. However, the differences of opinion that arose from the discussion results are also pointed out. For example, the report of the subcommittee on long-term solutions stated that "It is gratifying that an attempt to determine permanent principles for future monetary policy has made progress. In addition, complete agreement has been reached on several key points, and there is also unanimous support for the necessity of cooperation between central banks in various countries." It also stated that the subcommittee on long-term solutions fully recognized the importance of the future tasks of the Bank for International Settlements. Conversely, the subcommittee on short-term solutions believed that the conclusions of the previous meeting were too optimistic and replaced them with the following report, which stated that "Except for the debt issue, the various issues included in the agenda have not been fully discussed, and the result can only be to propose several major issues pending resolution. However, the subcommittee on short-term solutions is still prepared to continue working on it in the future." (Havas Telegram, 21st)</p>
<h3>Only Two Things Agreed Upon in the Economic Report</h3>
<p>Reiterating the Need to Reduce Tariffs</p>
<p>Various Issues Need to Be Negotiated Continuously</p>
<p>(London) Today, the secretariat of the conference also published a 15,000-word report drafted by the Economic Committee, detailing the results of six weeks of discussion. However, there were only two things on which unanimous agreement was reached: one was to declare the absolute necessity of reducing excessive tariffs, and the other was to continue negotiations on various economic issues. However, these two things were only a re-statement of long-known agreements. (National Telegram, 21st)</p>

<h3>Eight Countries Secretly Discuss the Silver Issue</h3>
<p>(London) Eight major countries secretly discussed the silver issue in the room of the US representative, Biddleman, today. It is heard that there are only a few words left to be revised regarding the agreement to limit sales and absorb excess production in designated treasuries. The secret meeting started at 12:30 PM. Representatives of the eight major countries went to Biddleman's luncheon and exchanged opinions at the table. After the banquet, they continued to discuss in Biddleman's room until 3:45 PM. It is said that they will hold another meeting at 3:00 PM tomorrow, hoping to reach a complete agreement at that time. The delay in negotiating the agreement was entirely due to the Canadian representative's unexpected opposition after each article of the draft agreement was passed. (Reuter's Telegram, 21st)</p>
<h3>The Wheat Agreement Encounters More Resistance</h3>
<p>(London) The hope that the wheat agreement can be reached at the end of the World Economic Conference is gradually diminishing today. The wheat shareholder committee formed this morning, chaired by the US representative Morganthau, which intends to mediate the differences of opinion between the parties, has considered a draft proposal containing five articles tonight. The first article stipulates that importing countries shall not increase wheat fields. This article has been agreed upon in principle, but the second article stipulates that tax rates should be reduced when wheat reaches a specified price. This article has encountered serious resistance, so the matter has now been returned to experts for review. The shareholders' meeting will reconvene tomorrow morning. It is reported that the representatives on this shareholder committee include representatives from exporting countries such as Australia, Canada, and Hungary, and representatives from importing countries such as France, Italy, and Britain.

<h3>Corsons Quietly Returns Home</h3>
<p>(London) The US representative, Corsons, returned to New York by ship today. Before leaving, he told people that the obstacles to the success of the conference were not only the issue of currency stability. We came here with the hope of the success of the conference, as the world knows. After we arrived here, we learned that the commerce of several major countries is currently in the process of recovery. The country is like a person, and when it feels that it is rising, it is always a little conceited. Therefore, its need for cooperation is not as urgent as before. (Reuter's Telegram, 21st)</p>
<h3>British-Japanese Trade War</h3>
<p>Britain is Planning Countermeasures Against Japanese Goods Dumping in Various Territories</p>
<p>It is Believed That High Tariff Walls Are Not Enough to Cope with the Competition</p>
<p>Japan Urges the Opening of Trade Negotiations Between India and Japan</p>
<p>Telegrams to Matsudaira to Contact Britain on Three Matters</p>
<p>(London) When the House of Commons moved to adjourn this afternoon, the competition of Japanese silk and cotton goods was discussed. Colonial Secretary Lister replied to the questions and admitted that the preferential treatment enjoyed by the colonies was not enough to cope with this competition. To enable the colonies to cope properly, the tax rate on certain commodities must be increased to 200%. In the event of failure of the commercial negotiations with Japan, the colonies will take steps to protect British interests. In view of this, the possibility of a fierce commercial war between Britain and Japan is becoming increasingly close. (Reuter's Telegram, 20th)</p>
<p>(London) When the British House of Commons met yesterday, Conservative MP Levey raised the issue of Japanese goods competing in the Empire, saying that it was an economic threat unprecedented in the history of the Empire. Taking the cotton and silk industries as examples, the competition of Japanese goods has caused endless damage to British industry. If you want to avoid this kind of damage, you must take emergency measures. From 1930 to 1932, the export of British silk fabrics decreased by 20%, while the export of Japanese silk fabrics increased day by day. This year, it will increase 33 times more than in 1931. In the British colonies, Japanese goods are also vigorously promoted and do not buy return goods. Last year, Japan sold goods worth 300,000 pounds to the British American island of Jamaica, while the goods purchased from the island were only worth 360 pounds. As for the cotton weaving industry, the phenomenon is the same. If Britain does not pay attention to dealing with it, it may be too late to regret it. Colonial Secretary Sir Lister replied that the competition of Japanese goods around the world is indeed terrible. Representatives of the business circles of Britain and Japan will hold a meeting to discuss this matter. Trade Minister Lonsiman has told the House of Commons about it. Lister also said that the preferential treatment enjoyed by Britain in various parts of the Empire is more than enough to resist the competition of goods from France, Germany, and the United States, but it is not enough to stop the competition of Japanese goods. Taking rayon as an example, the value of Japanese goods is actually 100% cheaper than British goods. Lister concluded that trade between Japan and the British colonies is extremely prosperous. It would be unreasonable to increase the import tax on Japanese goods to 200% in each of these colonies. In his opinion, Trade Minister Lonsiman is currently holding negotiations with the Japanese government, and we should do our best to assist it to achieve its full success. (Havas Telegram, 21st)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Regarding the trade issue between India and Japan, the Japanese government has requested the British government to grant full authority to the Indian government, but the British government has not yet given a definite answer. Moreover, the Indian government will hold parliamentary meetings from August 14 to September 20, which is also inconvenient to discuss trade issues. If this continues, the trade issue may not be resolved before October 10. Therefore, Japanese merchants have suffered a lot of losses. The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs will telegraph Ambassador Matsudaira to contact the British government on the following three matters: (1) There are many matters pending discussion on the trade issue between Japan and India. Japan hopes to start negotiations in parallel with the parliament. (2) If negotiations cannot be conducted in parallel, Japan hopes that the British government will agree to this provisional measure of extending the term of the commercial treaty to the date of the negotiations. (3) Please grant diplomatic power to the Indian government as soon as possible, otherwise, the Japanese government cannot send representatives to India to negotiate. (United Press, 21st)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese government recently ordered Ambassador Matsudaira in Britain to inquire with the British government about the extent to which Britain recognizes India's right to diplomatic negotiations with Japan. According to Ambassador Matsudaira's report to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the 21st, British Deputy Foreign Secretary Pencita sent a letter to Ambassador Matsudaira on the 20th, stating that after the British government canceled the trade treaty between India and Japan, in order to avoid India and Japan becoming countries without a treaty, it hopes that India and Japan will begin negotiations. The political department and relevant parties are currently negotiating, but the British government has not reached a definite opinion on the scope of the Indian government's right to diplomatic negotiations because the interpretation of the British constitution is quite difficult. Ambassador Matsudaira also reported on the negotiations with the British Secretary of State for India, Poas, saying that Poas's attitude was more rigid than that of the British Ministry of Foreign Affairs, advocating restricting the power of India's diplomatic negotiations. If the opinions of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Indian Affairs Department are not consistent, the British government's official reply to Japan will be delayed.

<h3>Investigation of the Tax Increase Issue</h3>
<p>There are Three Propositions for the Limit of Tax Increase</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The tax increase plan under investigation by the Japanese Ministry of Finance is divided into two types: one is to increase tax rates, and the other is to open new tax items. Those belonging to the first category are (1) corporate income tax (2) personal income tax (3) national debt interest tax (4) progressive income tax (5) capital interest tax (6) inheritance tax (7) liquor and beer tax, etc. Those belonging to the second category are (1) luxury tax (2) cosmetics tax (3) gasoline tax (4) property tax (5) commodity transfer tax, etc. There are also three propositions for the limit of tax increase, the contents of which are as follows: (1) The current expenditure must be paid with the current income, in which case the amount not paid will be about 70 million yuan, and the tax revenue must be increased to prepare sufficient funds. (2) The interest on the deficit public debt since September 18 must be paid with current financial resources, in which case the limit of tax increase must be raised year by year. (3) The expenses of the above two items must be paid with current financial resources. The amount required for the three propositions varies greatly. (China Federation Telegram, 21st)</p>
<h3>The Eastern Newspaper Bitterly Criticizes Britain and Russia</h3>
<p>Some Even Advocate Breaking Off Relations with Russia</p>
<p>The Tone Towards the United States Turns Flattering</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Japanese newspapers are now publishing remarks criticizing Britain and Russia, with extremely激烈的(ji lie de, intense) wording. The reason for opposing London is due to the increased import tax in India. As for Russia, it arises from opposing communism. In addition to newspapers and magazines denouncing Britain and Russia, leaflets have been discovered, bitterly criticizing London and demanding the severance of diplomatic relations with Russia. Foreigners are dealing with these newspaper comments calmly, believing that it is a common old habit of Japanese newspapers. For many years, Japan has been sparing no effort in attacking the entire United States and individual Americans. But today, since they do not like Britain and Russia, they have suddenly turned their tone and added flattery to the United States, which they usually dislike. It is expected that if the commercial negotiations with Seymour or London have a result and a satisfactory agreement is reached, Japan's anti-British propaganda will stop immediately. At the same time, whether Japan's current attitude towards Russia will continue depends on how the negotiations on the sale of the Chinese Eastern Railway progress. (Reuter's Telegram, 21st)</p>
<h3>Hull Denies that the United States and Japan Have Concluded an Arbitration Treaty</h3>
<p>It is Japanese Propaganda to Sow Discord</p>
<p>(Nanjing) It has long been rumored that the United States and Japan have concluded an arbitration treaty, but in fact there is no basis for it. According to reliable information from diplomatic circles, US Secretary of State Hull recently stated in London that he was not aware of any negotiations between the United States and Japan to conclude an arbitration treaty, nor was he aware of any other negotiations between the United States and Japan. The repeated rumors of the conclusion of an arbitration treaty between the United States and Japan are all propaganda carried out by the Japanese side, hoping to confuse the hearing and make Chinese and Westerners alike suspect that the United States, after agreeing to the League of Nations' fair judgment and guaranteeing that the United States will not act alone, is about to change its policy. In fact, Japan had firmly stated in the Executive Yuan that it opposed the general arbitration method, and Japan has never concluded a genuine arbitration treaty with any country until now. Therefore, this kind of propaganda containing the sowing of discord is a matter of pride for the Japanese, and all discerning people must not be confused by it.

<h3>Prospects for the British-Russian Commercial Treaty</h3>
<p>A Permanent Commercial Treaty is Unlikely to Be Established Before Russia's Debt to Britain is Resolved</p>
<p>(London) Today, Air Minister Londonderry stated in the House of Lords when discussing the Soviet-Russian commercial treaty that Britain and Russia will not be able to establish a permanent commercial treaty before Russia's debt to Britain is resolved. He also said that the issue of the Russian commercial delegation in London enjoying diplomatic privileges is currently under discussion. Two committees have now been established, one to consider a new commercial treaty and the other to deal with the special issue of trade payment differences between the two countries. The government's opinion is to resolve the issue of payment differences as soon as possible in order to remedy the situation, because so far, trade between Russia and Britain has been unfavorable to Britain.

<h3>U.S. Curbs Speculative Fluctuations</h3>
<p>Chicago Wheat Prices Plummet to Unprecedented Levels This Year</p>
<p>Board of Trade Halts Grain Futures Trading for One Day</p>
<p>British Plan to Swap Bonds</p>
<p>U.S. Dollar Exchange Rate Shows Improvement</p>
<p>Chicago: The Chicago Board of Trade has limited grain price fluctuations, with maximum limits set at eight cents for wheat, five cents for maize, four cents for oats, eight cents for rye, and five cents for barley, all per bushel. It also canceled weekly special trade privileges. The Minneapolis and Duluth markets have also announced price fluctuation limits as follows, per bushel: eight cents for wheat, eight cents for rye, five cents for barley, five cents for grain, four cents for oats, and fifteen cents for flaxseed. (20th, Reuters)</p>
<p>(New York) The Chicago wheat market experienced a panic today, with wheat prices plummeting to unprecedented levels this year, falling below one dollar per bushel. Closing prices were fourteen to seventeen cents lower than yesterday. Rye fell twenty-six cents, maize fell thirteen cents, and cotton futures fell seventy-two to eighty points. The exchange rate of the U.S. dollar against the British pound jumped sixteen cents, reaching four dollars and fifty-seven cents per pound sterling. This is widely believed to be due to the British Treasury's swap of gold bonds. British dollar bonds are in high demand, and market prices have soared, rising as much as nine pounds sterling. The New York stock market today also fell sharply, ranging from three to eleven pounds sterling. Some brewery stocks fell by twenty pounds sterling. It is estimated that approximately 8.12 million shares were sold today. (20th, Reuters)</p>
<p>Chicago: The Chicago Board of Trade decided tonight to halt all forward trading of grains and cereals tomorrow for one day, while spot trading will continue as usual. Cotton, securities, and other markets will also remain open. Earlier today, the Board ordered limits on the rise and fall of grain prices, with wheat and oats not allowed to fluctuate by more than eight cents per bushel, maize by five cents, and rye by four cents. These restrictions will be implemented after the opening of forward trading on Saturday morning. The Board of Trade stated that it would reinstate the policies of 1928 and 1919, temporarily halting trading after each technical adjustment. Due to the sharp drop in prices, sellers were extremely crowded, and market staff were very tired and needed a rest. In addition, relief personnel also needed an opportunity to organize relief efforts, so it was decided to suspend trading for one day. (21st, National News Agency)</p>
<p>(New York) The Minneapolis, Duluth, and St. Louis markets followed Kansas City today in suspending trading in miscellaneous grain futures. (21st, Reuters)</p>
<h3>Roosevelt Approves General Industrial Rules</h3>
<p>(Washington) The General Industrial Rules proposed by National Recovery Administration Director Johnson have been approved by President Roosevelt. These General Industrial Rules are a type of agreement between employers, and from August 31st to December 31st of this year, all employers should abide by the following conditions: not employing children under the age of fourteen; children aged fourteen to sixteen can work a maximum of three hours per day; employees' working hours should not exceed forty hours per week; factory workers' working hours should not exceed thirty-five hours per week. In any case, workers' working hours should not exceed eight hours per day. Stores' business hours should not be less than fifty-two hours per week. For stores employing only two people in cities with fewer than 2,500 people, the maximum working hours for employees and workers do not apply, but only in cities that are not in commercially prosperous areas. In addition, certain specialized industries are also exempt from this working hours restriction, but work exceeding the limit should be compensated with wages higher than normal. Employees' wages range from twelve to fifteen dollars per week, and workers' wages are fourteen dollars per week. The price at which each employer sells goods should not be higher than the price on July 1st, as exploiting consumers for excessive profits should be prohibited. These General Industrial Rules can be replaced by other rules proposed by industrialists and approved by President Roosevelt. (21st, Havas)</p>
<h3>British House of Commons Passes Gold Bond Swap Bill</h3>
<p>(London) Today, the House of Commons passed Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain's proposal by a vote of 131 to 22, approving the British Treasury's plan to swap 136 million U.S. dollars of 5.5% twenty-year gold bonds issued by the British government in the United States in January 1917. The U.S. dollar was most notable in the foreign exchange market, opening at four dollars and sixty-four cents, then four dollars and sixty-three cents, but soon fell to four dollars and seventy-two cents due to the large-scale sale of U.S. dollars by the United States and other foreign countries. The trend of gold coins is quite favorable to the British pound. (21st, Reuters)</p>

<h3>Authority and Organization of the Administrative Court</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Administrative Court President Mao Zuquan told reporters that the Administrative Court is to punish administrative agencies that disregard the rights and interests of the people. The former Beijing government had the "Pingzheng Yuan" (Administrative Council), which was similar in nature, with a slight difference: the Pingzheng Yuan also had the power to discipline civil servants. After the National Government established its capital, various legal codes were completed in order. The Litigation Law was promulgated in the 19th year of the Republic (1930), and the Administrative Court Organization Law and Administrative Litigation Fee Regulations were promulgated last year. The Administrative Litigation Law was officially implemented on June 23rd of this year, and the Court was established on the same day. An administrative lawsuit is filed with this court, with five judges forming a collegial panel, which conducts a written review and makes a judgment, which is binding on all related official agencies. No appeal or protest can be made against this judgment, but a retrial can be filed. The Court has two divisions, each with five judges. In addition to myself serving as a judge and division chief concurrently, there are also nine judges with "Simplified Appointment" status, one of whom is appointed as the division chief. The affairs of the Court are managed by clerks, with a chief clerk in charge of overall management. Currently, the Court has not yet heard any lawsuits, but everything internally is ready. Most of the judge list have been determined and submitted to the Judicial Yuan for submission to the National Government, which then handed it over to the Examination Yuan for qualification review, and will be announced by the National Government. They are expected to report to the Court for duty in the late part of this month. Currently, many cases have been received, but most of the procedures are not compliant. Cases that do not meet the required procedures will not be accepted, he said. (21st, Central News Agency)</p>

<h3>Global American Aviator Post Remains Undeterred</h3>
<p>Encountering Sudden Heavy Fog While Creating New Record</p>
<p>Fuselage Touches Ground and Is Damaged, Flight to Resume Once Repaired</p>
<p>Mattern Borrowing a Russian Aircraft, Following in Pursuit</p>
<p>Fanbenk, 20th, National News Agency: American aviator Post unfortunately encountered heavy fog, becoming lost for seven hours, just when the hope of creating a new global record was about to materialize. Running out of fuel, he was forced to land on an uneven square outside the village of Sheflat, about 100 miles west of here. The fuselage touched the ground and was quite damaged. Fortunately, no one was injured, and Post's ambition has not waned. He claims that once repairs are completed, he will immediately continue his trip to New York.</p>
<p>According to Post, after his plane flew over Ruibao, he suddenly encountered heavy fog and became lost. The fog was so thick that he had never seen it before in his life, causing him to fly blindly in the air for seven hours. When the gasoline ran out, the plane sank, so he tried to make it glide down. Unexpectedly, the ground below was uneven, causing the nose of the plane to touch the ground and overturn, bending the propeller. According to aviators who went to find Post, the estimated repair time is about eight hours. He will be supplied with a new propeller from Fanbenk. Post passed Nome at 10:30 this morning and Ruibao Town, which is 200 miles west of Fanbenk, at 1:30 PM. At that time, the gasoline remaining in his plane could still fly 500 miles. Waiting for Post for a long time, the personnel at the airfield suspected that the one seen in Ruibao might be a plane measuring Alaska and was not very anxious. Later, the plane measuring Alaska arrived here. According to its pilot, he had seen Post's plane 170 miles west of here. He organized a search team and found Post and his broken plane.</p>
<p>Fanbenk, 21st, National News Agency: American aviator Mattern, who was sent back to Nome from Siberia by Russian aviator Levanevsky after running out of gasoline, was also forced to land at an airfield near Nome. Today, both Mattern and Post were forced to land here due to running out of gasoline. It can be said to be a coincidence. However, Mattern's plane is intact. Mattern is now borrowing another plane to continue flying to New York. Mattern landed at 5:30 PM today and is expected to be unable to leave until Friday evening at the earliest. His arrival time in New York will almost coincide with Post's.</p>
<p>Nome, 20th, National News Agency: American aviator Post flew over Nome at 10:30 this morning. Marie, who crashed in northeastern Siberia during a global flight a few days ago, also set off for Alaska with the famous Russian aviator Levanevsky. Today, almost all residents here went to the Sulumen airfield outside the city to welcome Post, but Post sped past and could not even fly around once or twice in the sky, intending to proceed quickly in the hope of creating a new record. Not long after, another wireless message was received that American aviator Mattern, who crashed in Anadyr in early July, is also on his way here to meet Post in Nome and congratulate him on his success. The Soviet Aviation Administration has dispatched its famous aviator to drive the best aircraft for Mattern to use.</p>
<p>Reuters, 20th, New York: American aviator Post passed through Nome, Alaska today without landing there. He is currently crossing the Arctic Ocean to Fanbenk. According to news issued by Post himself, he is currently extremely tired, but he does not mind and still seeks to increase his flying speed. When Post departed from Boli, his record had exceeded the previous record by 15 hours and 46 minutes, so if Post can maintain his current speed, the result will definitely create a new record for circumnavigating the world. It is expected that after arriving in Phia Bank, he will make a 1,400-mile direct flight to Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, and then make a 2,100-mile flight to New York.</p>
<p>Tass, 20th, Boli: American global aviator Post left for Nome, Alaska at 12:58 PM (local time) today. Before departing, he said that he expected to exceed his old record of 8 days, 15 hours, and 51 minutes by at least 24 hours, and he was confident that he would reach Nome within 16 hours. He declared to the Tass News Agency representative that if he waited for good weather, and did not leave Boli on the 20th of July but on the 21st, he would only be able to recreate the record he and Gadi created in 1931, so he disregarded the unsuitable weather conditions and decided not to stay any longer. He also said that the poor climate he encountered on his journey from Berlin to Boli greatly undermined his opportunity to significantly improve the 1931 record. When he stepped into the pilot's room of his Winnie May aircraft, he deeply thanked him for the generous treatment he received during his flight through the Soviet Union. He said that he received warm welcomes at all the stations he stopped in the Soviet Union and received all the technical assistance he needed.</p>

<h3>Germany's Anti-Jewish Movement Intensifies</h3>
<p>Over Two Hundred Arrested</p>
<p>London Jews Demonstrate</p>
<p>(Reuters, Berlin, 20th) This morning, the Nazi Party in Nuremberg launched a large-scale arrest of Jews, with over two hundred people arrested, mostly merchants and shopkeepers. They were then escorted by the Stormtroopers, paraded through the streets, and finally sent to local barracks. The local Nazi Party stated that this action was aimed at Jewish associations. However, it is not yet known whether this action was authorized by senior party officials or whether the Stormtroopers acted on their own. It is also reported that a Jewish meeting held in a church in Nuremberg last night was dispersed by the police, and all those present were arrested.</p>
<p>(Reuters, Berlin, 20th) The Berlin Jewish News Agency was shut down by the police today, and all its equipment was confiscated. The agency is now prohibited from publishing news.</p>
<p>(Havas, London, 20th) This afternoon, approximately 50,000 Jewish merchants and employees in London's East End, who had participated in the European War, held a demonstration against the anti-Jewish actions of the German Nazi government, advocating a boycott of German goods. Catholics were also allowed to join this demonstration. Jews from various districts of London also came to participate in solidarity.</p>
<p>A continuous stream of people arrived on the road. A large number of police were densely packed along the roadside to monitor the movement until Hyde Park. However, when the demonstrators marched in formation, they were orderly and unafraid.</p>
<h3>Henderson Meets with Hitler</h3>
<p>To Visit Paris to Meet with French Authorities</p>
<p>(National News, Munich, 20th) Disarmament Conference Chairman Henderson's car broke down twice on the way from Prague to Munich, causing him to arrive later than scheduled. However, upon arriving in Munich, Henderson went directly to the Regina Hotel to meet with German Chancellor Hitler and Foreign Minister Neurath, who had been waiting for him. The conversation began at 8 p.m. and lasted about an hour. All the issues that had not been discussed in Berlin previously were discussed today. Regarding Henderson's suggestion of a meeting between the leaders of Germany and France, according to Henderson, this matter is still feasible, but both sides must first make careful preparations before it can be hoped to become a reality.</p>
<p>(National News, Berlin, 21st) After an hour of talks with German Chancellor Hitler, Henderson briefly toured the area before heading to Paris at noon.</p>
<h3>Hitler's Party Members Secretly Conduct Military Training</h3>
<p>(Havas, Copenhagen, 20th) According to reliable sources returning from Germany, in a voluntary work camp managed by the Nazi Party in a certain place along the Baltic Sea in northern Germany, the work team members, numbering eighty to one hundred, have the following work schedule and conditions: They rise at 6 a.m., dig soil to drain swamps for three hours, followed by two hours of gymnastics. This gymnastics is actually practice in arranging formations, handling weapons, and is no different from military training. In the afternoon, the team members practice in the open fields, using firearms and gas masks. From 4 p.m. onwards, the team members can move freely until roll call at 10 p.m. Sometimes, military drills are also conducted in secluded places at night. When it rains, the team members receive theoretical education to cultivate their military spirit. This training period lasts for three months. The most experienced members are given military ranks in the Nazi Stormtroopers. It is also reported that the number of voluntary work camps managed by the Steel Helmet organization is even larger than those managed by the Nazi Party, with stricter discipline, more complete military equipment, and more capable instructors. There are currently as many as 300,000 voluntary work team members throughout Germany.</p>
<h3>Papen Discusses the Importance of the Concordat</h3>
<p>And the Four-Power Pact Both Have Historical Significance</p>
<p>(Havas, Berlin, 20th) Vice-Chancellor Papen, currently in Rome, made a statement to a special correspondent of the Hamburger Abendblatt, explaining the importance of the Concordat between Germany and the Holy See. He said that when the liberal faction was in power in Germany, disputes often arose between the state and the church, resulting in no benefit to either side. The new government reversed this course and resumed cooperation with the church, the benefits of which are self-evident. Furthermore, this is also in line with the principles currently followed by Italy and Germany. Papen also said that the Concordat provides various guarantees to Catholics, and now the Catholic Church hopes that the Protestant Church can also enjoy the same guarantees. Papen also firmly stated that the Holy See and Germany negotiated and signed the agreement because they firmly believed that this agreement would be of great benefit in the fight against atheism and extremism. Papen then compared the Concordat with the Four-Power Pact, saying that these two documents of historical significance, both signed in Rome, have symbolic value. The governments of Italy and Germany are both under the command of a single leader, rather than governments of parliamentary parties, which is of great importance for the construction of Europe.</p>
<h3>Tokyo Entirely Dark</h3>
<p>Air Defense Drill Begins Last Night</p>
<p>(Dentsu, Tokyo, 21st) The Tokyo air defense drill began last night. At 9:35 p.m., as soon as the city-wide siren sounded, the air raid alarm was urgently reported from the surveillance posts in Suzaki and Murayama to the surveillance headquarters within the Metropolitan Police Department, spreading to the entire city through the police stations and branch offices in just one minute and twenty-two seconds. In the areas of Kojimachi and Kanda, the houses all extinguished outdoor lights and covered windows with black cloth, while turning on indoor lights, creating complete light control in the dark night. At that time, two assumed enemy planes attacked from the west of the capital, dropping flares on Tokyo Station and other important buildings, while searchlights on the ground were used to track them. After a few minutes of actual combat simulation, at 9:42 p.m., the enemy planes flew away in the dark sky, and the alarm bells of various buildings reported the lifting of light control. The city of Tokyo returned to being a city that never sleeps. Once the light control drill began, Tokyo Garrison Commander Lieutenant General Hayashi, along with his adjutants and staff, inspected the inside of the town of Kojimachi. The Kojimachi Defense Corps, as in wartime, realistically simulated from sunset onwards, fire drills and stretcher rescues.</p>
<p>(Dentsu, Tokyo, 21st) The large-scale air defense drill, centered on Tokyo, the capital, for three days starting on August 9th, has been reported in detail in previous dispatches. The military will take this opportunity to complete the capital's defense facilities. Therefore, a fundraising campaign from the private sector for 2.5 million yen is underway. Mitsui and Mitsubishi have reported that they will each donate 500,000 yen, to be donated over five years, with annual donations of 100,000 yen.</p>

<p>(Havas, Athens, 21st) A new trade agreement between Greece and Yugoslavia was signed yesterday.</p>
<h3>The German Government Seeks to Reform Modern Women's Psychology Through Clothing</h3>
<p>(National News, Berlin, 20th) The German government has recently established a women's fashion bureau, headed by the wife of the current Minister of Propaganda and Culture, Goebbels. The bureau is now actively working to ensure that German women's clothing styles can be independent. The bureau announced today that it will open a clothing material exhibition in mid-August. The purpose of the exhibition is to enable clothing manufacturers, style designers, and fabric weavers to cooperate closely from now on. If style designers can understand the broad characteristics of domestically produced fabrics, new styles will naturally arise from them. And if tailors can contribute to the color, style, texture, and edges of clothing, production will be easier to sell. It is said that this kind of attempt is actually to reform the psychology of modern women, arouse the characteristics of the German nation, and hope to advance in parallel with the new German trend.</p>
<h3>Japan Tries Hard to Reduce Imperial Household Expenses</h3>
<p>(Dentsu, Tokyo, 21st) The Imperial Household Ministry is currently urgently compiling the budget for the next fiscal year. Due to reduced income, it is still adhering to a tight policy. The total amount of the budget is roughly the same as this year, about 22.3 million yen. However, regarding the increase in academic incentive funds and social welfare subsidies, it has been decided to compile according to the imperial decree policy.</p>
<h3>Communist Bandits Re-Enter the Fujian Border</h3>
<p>One Group Flees to Guangze, One Group Flees to Jianning, the Fujian Army is Launching a Large-Scale Interception</p>
<p>(Fuzhou Correspondence) The communist bandits in northern Fujian, after being repeatedly encircled and suppressed by the army, have gradually become impoverished and have been surrounded in the four counties of Chong'an, Guangze, Jianning, and Ninghua. External communications are completely blocked. Cai Tingkai originally planned to first recover Changting in western Fujian to overthrow the communist base in Fujian, and then advance from Changting to Ninghua, to join forces with the Shaowu army to attack Guangze. At the same time, he requested the Jiangxi army to advance from Nanfeng to Jianning. With the three routes advancing simultaneously, the communist forces in northern Fujian would not be difficult to wipe out in one fell swoop. Unexpectedly, just as Cai recently went to Zhangzhou from Longyan to supervise the attack on Changting, the communist bandits in the counties of Yihuang, Nan..., Cheng, Lichuan, and Nanfeng in eastern Jiangxi, due to the fierce attack by the central army, suffered more than half of the casualties, and their food and ammunition were exhausted. They withdrew from Yihuang and Nancheng and fled through Lichuan to Guangze and Jianning on the Fujian border, temporarily gathering a crowd of 20,000. However, the food in the bandit areas was originally extremely scarce after being blockaded by the army. With the addition of this large group of bandits, they were bound to run out of food, so they went out to seize food everywhere. One group in Guangze, led by the bandit leader Huang Ligui, invaded Shaowu in early this month and began to make contact with the Zhou Zhiqun unit of the Fourth Independent Brigade stationed on the Shaowu-Guangze border. The Zhou brigade only had two regiments, and the bandit forces were vast and could not win, so they were temporarily caught in a bitter battle. Later, the Jiang Yan brigade of Liu Heding's division joined the front-line operations from Shaocheng and Yanping and launched a large-scale counterattack. The bandit forces were unable to withstand it and began to retreat into the Guang border from the Gushansi Mei area around the 9th and 10th. The Zhou and Jiang brigades are taking advantage of the victory to pursue them. The group in Jianning, led by the bandit leader Peng Dehuai, first invaded Tai'ning and then turned to Jiangle, having already fled to Wan'an. Fortunately, Liu Heding's division stationed there had extremely solid defenses, and the bandits could not succeed, so they changed direction and switched from Tai'ning to the defense area of the newly編第二師 second division Lu Xingbang's unit, first attacking Mingxi and then fleeing to Qingliu after looting. They are currently engaged in a fierce battle with Lu Xingrong, the brigade commander of the fourth brigade of Lu's unit, in the Luo Kou Ansha area on the route from Qingliu to Yong'an. The artillery fire has been extremely intense for days. Lu's division has now concentrated the teams stationed in Yong'an and Shaxian in the defense area at the junction of Mingxi and Qingliu, preparing to meet the attack. The agricultural, industrial, commercial, and student groups of Shaxian and Yong'an jointly sent a telegram to the provincial government and the Pacification Headquarters yesterday, requesting the immediate dispatch of teams to reinforce them. The authorities are currently coordinating the military operations against the bandits in northern Fujian. Furthermore, after this bandit disturbance in northern Fujian, the number of refugees has greatly increased again. Shaowu County alone has gathered more than 10,000 people. The county government has telegraphed the province for relief. (July 14th)</p>

<h3>The Reorganization of the Puppet Army Issue Resolved</h3>
<p>Reorganization Expenses Increased to 480,000 Yuan</p>
<p>The Reorganization of Shi Yousan's Troops Awaits Further Negotiation</p>
<p>The War Zone Relief Committee Will Be Established Immediately</p>
<p>(Special Dispatch from Beiping) The puppet army issue has been resolved after several contacts and negotiations. Since the Dalian meeting, the focus of the dispute between the two sides has only been on the amount of reorganization expenses. The puppet army side, seeing the general trend, could no longer resist stubbornly. The goal was to extort more money for distribution. The puppet army organization may look very large on the surface, but in reality, there are more officers than soldiers, and more soldiers than guns. In total, there are about 10,000. After the incorporation of 4,000, there are only 6,000 remaining. Calculating at 20 yuan per discharged soldier, it is less than 130,000 yuan. In order to extort more money, the puppet army side came up with various pretexts, demanding resettlement fees and advances in addition to the dismissal fees, totaling 500,000, several times more than the proper dismissal fees. Xue Zhiheng and others negotiated several times, but the puppet army was very insistent. Therefore, Li Zeyi, Yin Tong, and others came to Ping twice to ask for instructions. Regarding the issue of money, the authorities initially insisted on the amount of 300,000, and then compromised for the sake of the overall situation, slightly accommodating. Li Zeyi rushed to Tangshan with a Japanese military officer the day before yesterday. Yesterday (the 19th) at 3 p.m., a meeting was held in Li Jichun's puppet headquarters. In addition to Xue Zhiheng, Li Zeyi, and Li Jichun, Chaisan also participated. After three hours of negotiation, the reorganization expenses were determined to be 140,000, the resettlement fees 200,000, the private advances 75,000, plus the salary of 4,000 police officers for this month 48,000, and the salary of 6,000 dismissed soldiers 21,000, totaling 484,000 yuan. Once the money and uniforms are distributed, the formal reorganization will begin. Li Jichun was appointed as the chairman of the war zone military reorganization committee. The office will be located in the Jiaotong University in Tangshan, reorganized from the existing puppet headquarters, with monthly expenses of 8,000 yuan, paid by the Hebei Provincial Government. The 4,000 puppet army soldiers will be reorganized into two corps. With the important issues such as the reorganization expenses resolved, the rest can be easily solved. After the meeting, Li Zeyi left Tangshan and rushed back to report. He arrived in Tianjin last night to meet with Yu Xuezhong for consultations. This afternoon, he came to Ping with Qian Zongze to separately visit He and Huang, report on the progress, and ask for instructions on everything. The authorities were very pleased that the puppet army issue had been resolved and agreed to everything, and ordered active preparations for the takeover. The date of the takeover was originally set for the 21st, but due to the rush, it has been changed to the 23rd, still following the original procedure, divided into two routes, led by special commissioners Tao Shangming and others, to lead the takeover personnel to take over the war zone. The puppet army's internal factions are extremely complex. Li Jichun is nominally the leader, but the real power is in the hands of Zheng Yanhou and others. Zheng was originally obstructing this reorganization, but has gradually succumbed due to environmental pressure. After the incorporation, it has been decided that Zheng will serve as the commander of the First Security Corps, divided into four or six teams, with Zhao Lei and others serving as team leaders. The Second Corps will be organized by our side. The reorganized puppet army will be stationed in Luanxian and Fengrun. Today, the puppet army east of Lutai and in the Ninghe area have been gradually concentrated in the Tangshan-Luanxian area, awaiting reorganization. The nature of Shi Yousan's troops is different from that of Li Jichun's puppet army. Regarding the number of reorganizations, Shi requested the incorporation of 1,000 people, but our side only agreed to 5,000, which still needs to be negotiated.</p>
<p>The opening of the Beining Railway and the resolution of the puppet army issue could have been realized, but the section east of Lutai is currently temporarily managed by the Kwantung Army, and the Japanese side still has other demands, which are currently being negotiated. Whether it will be unconditionally recovered in the future remains a question.</p>
<p>The War Zone Relief Committee is now ready and will be formally established at the Political Affairs Committee tomorrow (the 21st) at 9 a.m., without holding a ceremony. Of the 5 million in relief funds, the central government has promised to allocate 1 million, and the central government's telegram has arrived. The committee will be able to remit the funds after formulating relief measures. The Hebei Provincial Government has drafted regulations for the 4 million public bonds, and the banks have also been contacted, and it is hoped that the issuance will not be hindered. The war zone disaster victims are in urgent need of relief. After its establishment, the committee plans to actively carry out relief operations. (July 20th)</p>
<h3>Other News on the Reorganization of the Puppet Army</h3>
<p>The Japanese Side Also Hopes for an Early Completion of the Reorganization</p>
<p>Yin Tong Does Not Want to Be an Inspector</p>
<p>Yu Xuezhong Talks About Taking Over the War Zone</p>
<p>(Special Dispatch from Tianjin) In addition to the reorganization expenses, Li Jichun's troops suddenly demanded 450,000 yuan in resettlement fees (the previous report of 260,000 yuan was not accurate), and also requested that Zheng Yanhou be appointed as the Luan Dong Garrison Commander or Bandit Suppression Commander. The committee members negotiating in Tangshan could not make a decision and sent a telegram to ask for instructions. It was also difficult to explain in detail, so Lei Shourong and Li Zeyi went to Ping to ask for instructions. Li Zeyi and Yin Tong arrived in Tianjin last night (the 18th) at 8 p.m. after asking for instructions in Ping. Lei Shourong arrived in Tianjin at 12 p.m. This reporter visited Yin at the Beining official residence in the Special First District. According to his statement, Chairman Huang was very dissatisfied with Li's demands. In addition to the reorganization expenses, another 60,000 yuan will be given, totaling 300,000 yuan, and no more. Zheng Yanhou is Li's subordinate and can only be placed in the two reorganized corps, without giving him another title of commander. In addition, there is also Pan Yugui (Liansheng), known as Fifth Master Pan, who is often stationed in Tianjin and is the most active person in handling diplomacy for Li and Zheng. This time, the military affairs are over, and Pan must be given a considerable position. In fact, Pan does not want to be an official, but only wants to get a share of the pie in the resettlement fees. The plan discussed in Dalian called for the complete completion of the reorganization issue in July. This was proposed by Kwantung Army representative Kita. The Japanese side attaches great importance to it, believing that it is Japan's established national policy to end military operations, so they are urging our side to complete it as soon as possible. The two commissioners, Lei and Li, went to Tangshan this morning (the 19th) at 9:45 a.m. The Japanese Embassy military officer, Colonel Chaisan, also went along to help Kita in the negotiations and resolutions. Lei and Li do not seem to have much confidence in this trip, but since the Japanese side hopes to complete it by the end of this month, and there are only ten days left until this deadline, if Li still does not comply by the 25th, we can only ask the Japanese side to understand and take the necessary measures to resolve it. The North China Political Affairs Reorganization Committee plans to send Tao Shangming and Yin Tong as war zone administrative inspectors after the reorganization and takeover are completed. Their powers are similar to those of the early prefects. It is not yet clear whether Tao will accept the position, but Yin has stated that he will not. Yin told reporters that he had served in the military in the past, and after resigning, he went into business in Qingdao. Because he had many friends in both the Japanese military and political circles, Huang Yingbai invited him to help this time, and he could not refuse out of friendship. He went to Changchun to negotiate with Mutō for the 휴전협정 armistice agreement and signed the agreement. He was one of the representatives at the Dalian meeting. The merits and demerits can only be left to public opinion. He has been idle for a long time and is not used to the life of an official. He hopes that the reorganization and takeover will be completed as soon as possible so that he can return to Qingdao. He is not capable of being an administrative inspector and has firmly declined. Because after the war zone is over, although the political power will be taken over by us, more than a dozen counties in Luanxi and east of Luanxi have become special areas, and trouble is inevitable in the future. There are Japanese Kwantung Army at each pass along the Great Wall line, and Japanese garrison troops along the Beining Railway, starting from Yu Guan, forming a scissors shape. Li Jichun is also stationed in Tangshan, and the labor movement of the Kailuan miners and the Tang-Yu section needs to be properly restricted, otherwise there will be more trouble. However, the workers have simple knowledge and are easily swayed by emotions. How easy is it to restrict the labor movement? Therefore, the candidates for inspectors must be experienced and capable, and he feels that his own talents are limited and it is difficult to take on this important task.</p>
<p>Provincial Chairman Yu Xuezhong told reporters that the reorganization event is handled by the 政整會 Political Affairs Reorganization Committee, and the takeover event is handled by the Provincial Government. The travel expenses and office expenses of the committee members are paid by the Provincial Government's special funds (交酬酢 entertainment), and the 政整會 Political Affairs Reorganization Committee is responsible for this. He believes that as long as the reorganization event is completed, the takeover can be carried out at any time, without the need to organize a takeover committee or special police. It is only necessary to appoint responsible people to handle the affairs separately, and to eliminate and reorganize the existing police in each county, and train the militia in each county to take on the responsibility of bandit suppression. In this way, a lot of expenses can be saved. However, some people oppose this, saying that without organizing a takeover committee, it will be impossible to handle any negotiations or obstacles. Without organizing special police, the militia will be unable to cope with large groups of bandits. This is certainly reasonable, but in fact, except for the county towns where the Japanese puppet army has withdrawn, which have been successfully taken over, the county towns where the puppet army is stationed cannot be taken over, and negotiations are impossible to carry out. Now, more branches and leaves are being added, and the organization is becoming more and more complete, but in reality, it is not very useful, but only to place a few more people. The special police are scheduled to have 4,600 people, in two corps, each corps with 2,300 people. The selection of the corps commander is still being considered. The number of special police has been prepared, and they can be formed into teams at any time when needed, roughly after the takeover. The 政整會 Political Affairs Reorganization Committee believes that the Japanese side has no problems based on the resolutions of the Dalian meeting and has urged the dispatch of personnel to take over the political power as soon as possible, so it is scheduled to depart on the 21st. In fact, although the Japanese side has no problems, the puppet army still has problems. Judging from the current situation, it is not possible to depart on the 21st. Even if they depart, the county towns where the puppet army is stationed cannot be taken over. The reorganization issue can be easily resolved as long as the Japanese side can put some pressure on Li Jichun, otherwise there may be more problems. Li Jichun sent his secretary-general Wen Jizuan to Tianjin last night, staying at the Huizhong Hotel. He went to the Provincial Government this afternoon to meet with Chairman Yu. It is said that Wen's mission is because Li intends to recommend several county magistrates, requesting that the Provincial Government approve them, and to establish the War Zone Military Reorganization Commander's Office in Tangshan, asking for Yu's understanding. Wen is scheduled to return to Tangshan tomorrow to report back. (July 19th, Yaori)</p>
<h3>&lt;External, Not Internal P]</h3>
<p>Mr. Ma stated that the remaining troops to be inspected number approximately seven thousand, with those under Deng Wen's command being the majority. Li Zhongyi's unit was originally part of the Jilin army and not part of the Heilongjiang provincial army. Furthermore, Li Zhongyi's unit had poor discipline and had repeatedly been reprimanded by him personally. After the recent inspection incident, he had repeatedly instructed Deng Wen to take extreme care to avoid internal conflicts. Therefore, the remaining troops are solely for external defense and absolutely not for internal suppression. Moreover, Deng Wen is currently stationed near Dolon, far from the central government's troops, and there is no possibility of any conflict occurring. As for the gradual approach of the central government's troops and Feng's forces, conflict is feared to be unavoidable, and he is quite apprehensive about this matter.</p>
<h3>Views on the Chahar Incident</h3>
<p>Mr. Ma continued to express his views on the Chahar incident, stating that if Mr. Huanzhang is truly sincere in resisting Japan, then it is truly commendable, and he expresses extreme sympathy. However, if he has other intentions, then he inevitably loses the faith and expectations of the general public. It is regrettable that our country's affairs have come to this point, solely due to this. Yet, even now, they still cannot yield to each other, resulting in ridicule from both domestic and foreign observers. If this continues, even if the country does not perish, it will be difficult to avoid falling into communism. At that time, it will be too late to regret. Moreover, what I do not understand is, at this time, what is it that everyone cannot forgive each other? Therefore, if we have no national concept, then so be it; otherwise, we should quickly awaken and understand the current difficulties of the central government, giving it a chance to recover. I deeply believe that the central government will ultimately live up to our expectations. Otherwise, simply leaving it alone would also be acceptable. In my opinion, Feng's resistance to Japan seems somewhat late. When the central government and the Japanese were fiercely fighting in Shanhaiguan, why didn't Feng send troops to Dolon to create a pincer movement?</p>
<h3>Resist Japan, Don't Just Talk</h3>
<p>Mr. Ma then spoke about the issue of resisting Japan, stating that he has consistently adhered to his original intention. However, resisting Japan cannot be achieved by empty talk; it should start with practical preparation. Otherwise, mere sacrifice is of no benefit. I deeply believe that the central government will not immediately abandon the Northeast. If we can give it an opportunity to reorganize and prepare, then the goal can ultimately be achieved. At that time, those Chinese who possess true patriotic sincerity may as well dedicate their efforts.</p>
<h3>Departing Shanghai Tomorrow or the Day After</h3>
<p>Regarding the matter of going to Mogan Mountain for recuperation, Mr. Ma stated that he has largely decided to leave Shanghai by car tomorrow, Sunday, or the day after, Monday. The only companions will be Zhou Weitai, the former Director of the Civil Affairs Department of the Heilongjiang Provincial Government, and Zhang Dianjiu, the Deputy Commander of the Northeast People's Anti-Japanese National Salvation Army, and a few others. The rest will temporarily remain in Shanghai, he said.</p>
<p>Near Chaoyang Temple, in front of a dilapidated temple on the railway, on the night of July 17th, Ishimoto's special train indeed arrived. At that time, the ambushing troops raised their guns and attacked the train. Battalion Commander Liu personally captured Ishimoto on the train, forcing him to stop the train, and then took this envoy of the Japanese Empire away. At that time, Ishimoto originally had a guard of over seventy people, but because they were unsure of the situation and suspected that Tang Yulin was not sincere, they did not resist.</p>
<h3>Secret Treasonous Conditions</h3>
<p>After Ishimoto's capture, the Japanese invaders and Tang both panicked greatly. Among the documents found on Ishimoto, it was learned that the traitor Tang and the Kwantung Army had already drafted conditions, namely, the Kwantung Army would return Tang's property in Shenyang, valued at 50 million yuan, and Tang would simultaneously agree to: (1) place the Beipiao coal mine under the management of the Fengshan Railway Bureau; (2) incorporate the entire province of Rehe into the puppet state of Manchuria, raising the puppet state's flag from July 21st; and (3) allow the Japanese army to freely station troops in Rehe and have the Japanese army appoint one instructor in each county. However, these conditions ultimately failed to materialize at that time due to Ishimoto's capture; otherwise, the overall situation in Rehe would have been realized a year ago.</p>
<h3>Holding Strategic Locations and Defending to the Death</h3>
<p>In addition, Mr. Li also obtained many schemes of the Japanese army against the entire North China region, which ultimately led to the Japanese army launching a major advance into China. When the hot war began, Mr. Li led his troops to resist with all their might, fighting bloody battles in the Chaoyang Temple and Guyuan areas. The extent of the losses and the number of deaths were impossible to estimate at that time. Although the fighting lasted only a few days, Tang Yulin retreated without a fight. Seeing that the overall situation could not be salvaged, Mr. Li, with his isolated army insufficient to resist the major enemy, led his troops to retreat and defend the strategic passes of Hushiha, Chuanlinggang, Yugou, and Baimaguan in western Rehe. These places are all towering mountains, and Mr. Li's troops are all native people who are deeply familiar with the local geography. They hid deep in the mountains and engaged in guerrilla contact with the enemy.</p>
<h3>Recent Confrontational Situation</h3>
<p>Later, after discovering that there were very few Japanese troops invading Rehe and that they were mostly concentrated in the cities, Mr. Li and Mr. Wang led their troops to formally occupy counties such as Wanping, Pingning, Fuxin, and Tanghekou, and formed a maintenance association with local police and administrative agencies, confronting the enemy to this day. According to Mr. Wang Yunping, the Japanese troops in Rehe who are closest to our forces and form a confrontation are only the Suzuki Cavalry Brigade and the Motegi Infantry Division. With the outbreak of the Chahar war, those two units have also moved slightly. If we can have a concrete plan at this time, then counterattacking is the right opportunity, and recovering Rehe should also not be impossible. The purpose of this visit is solely to report what has been heard to the compatriots in the South and to request practical guidance from all parties. It is planned to invite the press in the near future to give a systematic account.</p>
<h3>Huang Musong Awaits a Plane to Return to the Capital</h3>
<h3>Accompanying Staff Returning to Shanghai Arrived at the Port on the 27th and 28th of This Month</h3>
<p>Since the second Xinjiang incident occurred, the central government believed that the mission of Huang Musong, the envoy to Xinjiang, had been completed, and telegraphed Mr. Huang to immediately return to the capital to report on everything, and separately dispatched Gong Bicheng and Peng Zhaoxian, special commissioners for party affairs in Xinjiang, to enter Xinjiang to investigate the truth of this incident and to mediate with all parties nearby. The Dagong News Agency reporter obtained reliable information from relevant parties in this port yesterday that Mr. Huang Musong recently sent a telegram urging the dispatch of an aircraft to Xinjiang to take him back. The envoy's office in the capital has negotiated with the Eurasia Aviation Corporation. All personnel who accompanied Mr. Huang into Xinjiang and those en route have also separately taken ships from Vladivostok to Shanghai and are expected to arrive at the port on the 27th and 28th of this month. The news is recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Mr. Huang's Telegram</h3>
<p>Mr. Huang sent a telegram to Lin Weihou, Director of the Envoy's Office, from Xinjiang the day before yesterday, stating: "Your telegram has been received. After receiving Director Wang's telegram, I will immediately conclude the affairs of this office and await the aircraft to return east. I hope you will urge the aircraft to come directly so that I can take it back to the capital. Brother Huang Musong kowtows with respect."</p>
<h3>Accompanying Staff Returning to Shanghai</h3>
<p>The accompanying staff, advisors, and senators who accompanied Mr. Huang to Xinjiang, except for Gao Changzhu and others who arrived in Dihua, Xinjiang, in advance to prepare for the establishment of the envoy's office, all traveled by water and land routes. When the second incident in Xinjiang occurred, the staff were still en route, so the envoy's office telegraphed them separately, urging them to return immediately. It is learned that Wang Zengshan, Yang Huchen, Zhang Jianxuan, Wang Ruji, and four others who traveled by sea have arrived in Vladivostok. After receiving the report from the capital, they boarded a ship on the 18th of this month and left Vladivostok for Shanghai. They are expected to arrive at the port on the 27th and 28th of this month. Qiu Jingxing, Luo Jing, Guo Dingchen, and others who had already set off have arrived at Xiezhu, a border town in Soviet Russia bordering Xinjiang. After receiving the telegram, they immediately stopped their journey. In addition, staff members Xia Zhongyi, Ji Huaying, and Zhang Cheng arrived in Xi'an by plane from Suzhou the day before yesterday and are currently staying there for matters. They will also await a plane to return to the capital in the coming days.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Finance Remits One Million to Relieve Ping Disaster Victims</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance sent a telegram to the Beiping North China War Zone Relief Committee stating: "To the Beiping North China War Zone Relief Committee: It is reported that your committee will be established soon. This ministry is allocating one million yuan, remitted to Mr. Zhou Zuomin for transfer. We hope you will receive it and use it to relieve the disaster area and ask for a reply." The seal of the Ministry of Finance.</p>

<h3>Second Batch of Five Aircraft Ordered by the Aviation Association Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday, Named After Ningbo Compatriots, Shanghai Merchants, and Shanghai Workers, Still Requiring Performance Testing According to the Order Contract</h3>
<p>In May of this year, the Chinese Aviation Association requested the Military Affairs Commission to entrust Mr. Kong Xiangxi as a representative to order eighteen 700-horsepower Curtiss Hawk fighter planes from the Intercontinental Aviation Corporation of New York, USA. The first aircraft arrived in Shanghai in mid-May and was named the "Shanghai City" at the Jiangwan Racecourse on the 1st of last month. It has been sent to the Aviation Administration for integration into the unit. The second batch of five aircraft of the same type, shipped by the Grand President of the Dollar Steamship Company, arrived in Pudong at 2:00 PM yesterday and will be unloaded from the shore this morning.</p>
<h3>Named After Organizations</h3>
<p>The Aviation Association has decided to name this batch of aircraft after the organizations that have paid off their donations. The total price of the eighteen aircraft is 400,086 US dollars, with each aircraft costing 22,224.50 US dollars, which is equivalent to about 78,000 silver standard dollars at yesterday's market price. Those already decided are the "Ningbo Compatriot" of the Ningbo Shanghai Compatriot Association, the "Shanghai Worker" of the General Labor Union, and the "Shanghai Merchant" of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. The remaining two aircraft have not yet been decided.</p>
<h3>Continued Performance</h3>
<p>According to the aircraft purchase contract, when the first batch of three aircraft arrived in China, Intercontinental Aviation Corporation should send personnel to drive and test them, flying to an altitude of 5,000 feet, opening full throttle, descending vertically, and then rapidly flying up again. In addition to the "Shanghai City" aircraft, which Major Doolittle performed various amazing techniques at the naming ceremony, the second batch of aircraft will still need to perform test flights.</p>
<h3>Dai Ji May Return to Shanghai Next Week</h3>
<h3>The 128 Memorial Hall of the Garrison Department Will Hold an Opening Ceremony in Two Weeks</h3>
<p>Dai Ji, Commander of the Songhu Garrison, since being transferred to the position of Director of the Civil Affairs Department of Fujian, Mr. Dai himself is still staying in Jiangxi and has not returned. According to news from the Longhua Command yesterday, there is no definite date for Mr. Dai's return to Shanghai. At the latest, it should be in the middle of next week. The 128 Memorial Hall of the Garrison Department is currently actively preparing and arranging. It is expected that the opening ceremony will be held within two weeks. At that time, Mr. Dai will personally attend and participate in the ceremony to leave a memorial before going to Fujian to take office.</p>
<h3>The Hai Gong Preparatory Committee Reports on the Incident of the Tunam Being Hit</h3>
<h3>Yesterday, Shanghai Press Was Invited to Hear About How the Changchun No. 9 Went Off Course</h3>
<p>After the China Seamen's Union Preparatory Committee learned that the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Tunam ship was sunk by the Changchun Maru, it invited the press yesterday evening to report on the handling process and to send more people to negotiate with the headquarters for the sailors' compensation. The situation is recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Negotiating Compensation</h3>
<p>The China Merchants Bureau handled the compensation for the Tunam ship disaster in accordance with maritime law, issuing one year's salary, with the Jun'an Association supplementing each person with 500 yuan. The sailor management department has already received the compensation. The cargo department issued 500 yuan per person through the compradore, which has also been received. However, the stoker, middle cabin, and catering departments refused to receive it. The Follow-up Committee sent three staff members, Zhang Huiming, Cui Xiqiao, and Zeng Shanren, to the China Merchants Bureau at 3:00 PM yesterday to propose eight conditions. The General Manager Liu Hongsheng met with them. Regarding the proposed conditions, he agreed to first hand them over to the executive director for review and then submit them to the board of directors for discussion, requesting instructions from the Ministry of Communications before responding.</p>
<h3>Inviting the Press</h3>
<p>The China Seamen's Union Preparatory Committee invited reporters from various newspapers to the Atlantic Western Restaurant at 6:00 PM yesterday afternoon. First, the Standing Committee Member Zhang Jianbai reported on the handling of the Tunam ship disaster, saying: "After the news came that the China Merchants Bureau's Tunam ship was sunk by the Japanese ship Changchun Maru off Chengshanjiao in Shandong Province, north of Sheshan Island, we were extremely saddened. Our association encountered this major incident at the beginning of its establishment, which is extremely unfortunate. We are extremely grieved about the occurrence of this tragedy. Because it is our duty, we are responsible for handling all the follow-up matters for the disaster-stricken employees. The handling process of this case has been reported to the central government and the Ministry of Communications. As for the detailed situation, we will omit it."</p>
<h3>Responsibility Issues</h3>
<p>The China Seamen's Union issued a statement saying: "In order to clarify the details of the accident, we have specially drawn a map and explained it. The China Merchants Bureau's Tunam ship was sailing from Yantai to Shanghai, while the Japanese Changchun Maru was sailing from Qingdao to Dalian. Their routes formed an 'I' shape. Unexpectedly, the Changchun Maru took a shortcut and did not follow the prescribed route. When it reached the lighthouse near North Sheshan Island, it used an echo to warn the Changchun Maru to turn east to avoid danger. At this time, the Tunam ship was passing from north to south and was cut off at the waist, leading to the accident. It is known that the Japanese ship should bear full responsibility for this case. If the Changchun Maru had followed the prescribed route, the Tunam ship would never have suffered this tragedy." The handling of this case by our association can be divided into two major steps: (1) regarding the follow-up issues, we will discuss and handle them with the China Merchants Bureau; (2) we will urge the diplomatic authorities to negotiate seriously with the Japanese government, so as not to repeat the mistakes of the Xin Daming tragedy negotiations.</p>
<h3>The Clearance Office of the Russo-Asiatic Bank Submits Another Protest Against the Sale of the CER</h3>
<h3>Resolutely Opposing the Infringement of Creditor Rights and Interests</h3>
<p>The Clearance Office of the Russo-Asiatic Bank in China, because the Soviet Union sold the Chinese Eastern Railway (CER) and negotiations began in Japan, in order to protect the bank's creditor rights, specifically based on the provisions of Section 4 of Article 9 of the Beijing Agreement signed between China and Russia on May 31, 1924, as the holder of the CER stock certificates, protested separately to the Soviet Ambassador to China, Bogomolov, and the Japanese Minister to China, Ariyoshi Akira, stating that any sale or other circumstances of the CER would not be recognized as valid. After the protest was filed, in addition to the Japanese legation's reply stating that the protest had been forwarded to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of their country for handling, there has been no formal reply from either side to date, nor has there been any indication of the CER Clearance Office's creditor rights. Recently, the situation of the CER sales meeting has been extremely quiet, and it seems to have been shelved due to price issues. However, according to general observations, the illegal sale of the railway will eventually be successful in the future. The Soviet authorities have planned to use the proceeds from the sale of the CER to expand new railway lines domestically in order to compensate for the losses suffered by the Soviet Union after the sale of the CER and to reverse the decline in Far Eastern operations. According to news from the CER Clearance Office, because the Japanese and Russian sides have not responded to the protests filed, it is not known whether the CER creditor rights will be taken into account during the negotiations. However, the CER must maintain its claims in order to maintain the interests of its creditors, so it is difficult to remain silent. The liquidator Zhu Puquan issued a second protest yesterday, which was sent to the Japanese and Russian legations separately. The general idea was that the CER must protect those creditor's rights and interests. CER must not disregard the creditor rights and interests of CER, and CER must resolutely oppose any treaties and contracts arising from CER transactions.</p>
<h3>Baoshan County Villagers Petition to Repair the Beitshidong Seawall</h3>
<h3>Promptly Order the Department of Construction to Send Personnel to Investigate and Estimate</h3>
<h3>Use Old Owed Grain to Offset the Loan</h3>
<p>Yan Fenglou and other villagers in the Fifth District of Baoshan County stated that the Beitshidong Yanchi north seawall was damaged by mold rain, and the soil collapsed. The autumn flood tide is imminent and cannot be resisted. Therefore, they submitted a petition to the Jiangsu Provincial Government, requesting prompt repairs. The original petition is recorded below:</p>
<p>To the Jiangsu Provincial Government Chairman:</p>
<p>The Beitshidong Yanchi north seawall in the Fourth District of Baoshan County, which is 125 zhang long, was telegraphed in September and October last year to request the dispatch of personnel to investigate, estimate, and allocate funds for repairs. The reply from Your Excellency's office No. 19228 stated that the Department of Construction has been ordered to review the matter. In addition, it was noted in the newspapers on October 29 that Your Excellency's office decided at the meeting on the 28th to have the counties concerned raise funds for the emergency repair of the Baoshan Beitshidong Yanchi north seawall. Fengxi and others were deeply gratified to hear this good news. However, the project is complex and requires a large sum of money, and it may not be easy for the counties to raise funds on time. In late March, a hurricane struck for days, causing even more damage and creating a dangerous situation that could change at any moment. Therefore, we telegraphed Your Excellency's office again in April, requesting the allocation of funds as soon as possible to start repairs to avoid accidents. Later, we received a notice from the county government relaying Your Excellency's order that the project would still have to wait for the counties to raise funds before a decision is made and a comprehensive plan is drawn up for repairs. We secretly investigated that the seawall section is adjacent to Beitshidong and is located in a key area. The water is originally turbulent during the northeast wind. The repairs were not completed for a long time during the emergency repairs 20 years ago, and they were eroded and uprooted by huge waves last spring. Continuing the repairs last year, the soil has collapsed due to recent mold rain, and the seawall surface is crumbling and in imminent danger. If repairs are not urgently planned, how can we resist the imminent autumn floods? Fengxi and others are extremely alarmed to witness this situation, so we are making a fifth request, begging Your Excellency's office to quickly order the Department of Construction to send personnel to investigate and estimate, and to order the Department of Finance to quickly raise a large sum of money from the banking sector using the old owed grain from the counties to ensure completion within a time limit. Otherwise, not only will the people of the entire county bury themselves in the belly of the fish, but the fields, houses, and lives of the people in nearby counties will also be affected. Since the local people have fulfilled their obligation to pay taxes, they should have the right to protect their lives and property, so we make another urgent appeal, begging for prompt approval and implementation. Baoshan County Fifth District Huiyuan Township Head Yan Fengqi and all the villagers kowtow together.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Notifies All Industries to Advocate for Domestic Goods and Incorporate Them into Industry Regulations</h3>
<h3>Resisting Investigations Will Be Punished Separately</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce issued a notice yesterday, saying:</p>
<p>To whom it may concern,</p>
<p>At the current meeting of member representatives, the joint meeting of directors and supervisors discussed a proposal to implement the previous resolution to promote domestic goods, starting with an investigation and punishing those who violate the resolution according to the circumstances. The internal affairs of this proposal state that in June of last year, when this association held the third meeting of member representatives, it was resolved that the task of this association from now on should be concentrated on promoting domestic goods in order to find a way out for merchants. From the perspective of merchants and from the perspective of the industries of the members of this association, there are producers and distributors, and merchants engaged in production are also consumers, such as the raw materials used by factories. If merchants in this association who manufacture domestic goods work hard to produce, but merchants who are distributors prefer to order cheap foreign goods for sale, and if manufacturers need raw materials, but there are clearly domestic goods that can be ordered, but they do not purchase from merchants who are distributors, then the purpose of promoting domestic goods will still be difficult to achieve. Therefore, the so-called promotion of domestic goods must be carried out by all merchants with one heart and one mind. If there is any slack in any part, the entire plan will inevitably be abandoned. The reason why the promotion of domestic goods has not been effective in the past year is due to this problem. Among the members, it is necessary for this association to have precise statistical investigations into the content of each industry in order to understand who is strictly abiding by the resolutions and who is superficially compliant. This matter is stipulated in Article 3, Section 6 of the Chamber of Commerce Law and belongs to the duties that the Chamber of Commerce should perform. Moreover, the second meeting of member representatives of this association also resolved to carry out commercial statistics as soon as possible. Based on the above circumstances, the implementation of commercial investigations should not be delayed any longer. Now, the investigation methods are proposed as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Instruct the Commerce Department to prepare detailed forms, supervise the various trade associations to handle the investigation and statistics separately, and assist in the process with the Commodity Exhibition Hall and the Committee for Promoting Domestic Goods of this association, list the commodity components of the factories and firms in each industry obtained from the investigation in the statistics, and announce them to all sectors so that consumers know what to choose.</p>
<p>(2) Those who resist the investigation of this association or are found to have acted in violation of the resolution to promote domestic goods after the investigation will be regarded as violating the resolution of this association and hindering the reputation and credit of this association and will be punished separately in accordance with Articles 12 and 19 of the constitution of this association, and all economic relations with them may be severed with notice to all industries.</p>
<p>(3) All those who should be expelled for violating the promotion of domestic goods will be authorized by the meeting of member representatives to the Executive Committee for handling, and will still be submitted to the next meeting of member representatives for ex post facto recognition.</p>
<p>(4) This association should notify all industries to incorporate the two levels of promoting domestic goods and obeying the investigation of this association into the industry regulations. Those who violate them will be punished by the penalty rules for violating the industry regulations, and the relevant associations will propose methods for punishment and submit them for approval.</p>
<p>The above methods are intended to make the resolution to promote domestic goods of the previous session easier to implement and take effect. Should this be appropriate, please have the meeting of member representatives decide on the matter, and the Paper Industry Association proposes that the Municipal Chamber of Commerce promote various industry associations to organize inspection teams from various industries as soon as possible to carry out work.</p>
<p>The Copper, Iron, and Machinery Industry Association of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, proposed that as Japanese goods are selling well, merchants should know their shame and reflect on themselves, and requested the conference to discuss methods and seek solutions. All three cases were merged for discussion and resolved to be handed over to the Executive Committee for handling. The 10th Executive Committee meeting decided to hand them over to the Committee for Promoting Domestic Goods to proceed according to the original methods proposed by the joint meeting of directors and supervisors. The 16th Committee for Promoting Domestic Goods decided to notify all industry associations of the third and fourth items of the original proposed methods for separate reference and handling. The corresponding case is recorded and relayed, and it is hoped that your association will refer to it and handle it accordingly.</p>
<h3>The National Federation of Chambers of Commerce Submits a Petition to Amend the Partnership Provisions of the Civil Code</h3>
<h3>Should Restore the Original Habit of Sharing According to Shares</h3>
<p>The National Federation of Chambers of Commerce telegraphed the Legislative Yuan, requesting an amendment to Article 681 of the Civil Code, which reads:</p>
<p>To the Legislative Yuan in Nanjing:</p>
<p>Recently, a letter was received from the Shanghai Grain, Oil Cake, and Allied Trades Association, stating that after the promulgation and implementation of the Civil Code and the Civil Code Implementation Law on May 5, 1930, regarding the partnership provisions, Article 681 of the Civil Code stipulates that when the partnership property is insufficient to pay off the debts of the partnership, the partners shall be jointly and severally liable for the insufficient amount. This completely overthrows the original habit of sharing partnership debts according to shares and makes the partners face the danger of sacrificing all their property due to the failure of one part of the business. This association believes that this legal restriction affects the prosperity of commerce and is not a trivial matter. It has jointly proposed to the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce to request that the Legislative Yuan amend the case. However, this case is too important. If it is not amended, the partnership organization will disappear in the market, and if we investigate to the extreme, the entire commerce will be plunged into a desperate situation. It is extremely necessary to send a letter to your association and request a joint request for amendment. Having examined this, the operation of partnership is based on the size of capacity, recognizing the amount of shares, and distributing profits and losses according to the shares. Rights and obligations are equal, and society has become a fair habit. Now, according to the Civil Code, profits are distributed according to the shares, but losses are jointly and severally liable, which violates the principle of equal rights and obligations. What the association has stated is that it affects the future of commerce and is extremely true. It is reasonable to telegraph to Your Yuan for review and approval, and sincerely ask that Article 681 of the Civil Code be amended so that partnership debts are shared according to the shares in order to maintain the inherent fair habit.</p>
<p>The President of the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce, Lin Kanghou.</p>
<h3>Antiques Will Be Unpacked and Inspected Next Week</h3>
<h3>The Interim Supervisory Committee Will Be Established Tonight</h3>
<h3>The Shanghai Branch May Need to Be Established</h3>
<p>After the antiques of the Palace Museum were transported to Shanghai, they were damp during the journey. With this midsummer heat, there are concerns about mold and insects, so it is planned to unpack and inspect them. In order to seek prudence, the acting director Ma Heng came to Shanghai to organize an interim supervisory committee to supervise the progress of this matter. The committee has set the establishment ceremony for 6:00 PM today, and the unpacking and inspection of the antiques will also be carried out next month. The news is recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>The Supervisory Committee Will Be Established Tonight</h3>
<p>The Interim Supervisory Committee is jointly formed by six agencies, including the Executive Yuan, the Military Affairs Commission, the Academia Sinica, the Municipal Council, the Local Court, and the Palace Museum. Only the Palace Museum has two members, and the rest send one member each. After the acting director of the Palace Museum, Ma Heng, arrived in Shanghai, he notified the agencies to send representatives to participate. As for the Executive Yuan and the Military Affairs Commission, it is heard that they have not yet sent representatives to Shanghai, but it is expected that representatives will arrive in Shanghai today, because the committee has scheduled the formal establishment ceremony for 6:00 PM today at the Palace Museum office on Albert Road.</p>
<h3>Unpacking and Inspection Next Week</h3>
<p>As for the issue of inspecting the antiques, it can be held next week. Today's supervisory meeting will determine the date of unpacking and inspection. At that time, the Interim Supervisory Committee will send representatives to participate in the supervision in order to show prudence. The Interim Supervisory Committee will also be disbanded after the inspection is completed. According to Mr. Ma, this unpacking inspection will only take the items out of the boxes for sorting. If they are to be sun-dried, it may not be possible to realize this due to the limited space.</p>
<h3>The Case of Yi Peiji's Embezzlement</h3>
<p>Regarding the case of Yi Peiji's embezzlement, according to Mr. Ma Heng, he does not know. The reporter from China East News also learned from another source that the case is being investigated by the board of directors. Even if the Kyoto court opens a trial, it will have to wait for the board of directors to collect evidence for the court's reference before opening the court for questioning.</p>
<h3>Exhibition Cannot Be Realized</h3>
<p>The unpacking and inspection of the Palace Museum's antiques will be supervised by the Interim Supervisory Committee. After the inspection is completed, they will still need to be packed and placed in boxes. People at sea have requested a public exhibition to satisfy the eyes of the Shanghai people. According to confirmed information, this matter cannot be realized due to the lack of funds and space.</p>
<h3>Remarks by Acting Director Ma</h3>
<p>The reporter from China East News visited the Acting Director Ma Heng yesterday. According to him, this trip to Shanghai is to organize an interim supervisory committee. In the future, he will still have to go to Peiping. The official appointment of the director of the Palace Museum will have to wait for the approval of the Palace Museum Board of Directors. He is a representative in nature. As for the establishment of a branch in Shanghai, it will also have to wait for the approval of the Board of Directors, but it can largely be realized, because the best items have already been transported to Shanghai.</p>
<h3>The Eleventh Batch of Refugees from Mexico Talk About Their Hardships</h3>
<h3>The U.S. Government Will No Longer Subsidize</h3>
<h3>Telling the Government to Quickly Find a Way</h3>
<p>The eleventh batch of refugees from Mexico arrived in Shanghai on the Grand President of the Dollar Company at 1:30 PM yesterday. However, due to cabin space, only Chen Shou and Cao Ren arrived. The Overseas Chinese Association and the Refugee Maintenance Association sent representatives to the port to take care of them. They were taken to the association's office on Guizhou Road at 2:00 PM. According to Chen Shou, the refugees who fled from Mexico to the United States were sent back to China by the U.S. government, with transit expenses from Nogales to San Francisco by train and meals costing 50 U.S. dollars (requiring three and a half days), and about 45 U.S. dollars for the ship from San Francisco back to China. Therefore, each person needs a subsidy of 100 U.S. dollars. At present, the U.S. has reached more than 400,000 U.S. dollars in this subsidy, and it is difficult to estimate those who come later. Therefore, they are negotiating with Mexico on the one hand, not allowing Mexican overseas Chinese to flee to the U.S. again, and on the other hand, they plan to stop subsidizing refugees who have fled to the U.S. Therefore, refugees staying in the U.S. are in a dilemma. If our country does not quickly increase relief efforts, the future will be unimaginable. Chen and Huang are both from Taishan, Guangdong. It is heard that they returned to the original ship after dinner and returned to Hong Kong this afternoon to return to their hometown.</p>

<p>Educational News Highlights: Ministry of Education Sets Deadline for Rectification of National Peking University; Female Students Force President Gu to Resign</p>
<p>(Special Dispatch from Beiping) Regarding various issues at National Peking University, the Ministry of Education has set a deadline for complete execution within the summer vacation. The school sports activities for various colleges and high school students could have been concluded, but fearing prolonged complications and the resurgence of student unrest, Xu Songming, the acting president of National Peking University, finds himself in a dilemma. He hopes for a swift resolution to the student unrest. Details from various perspectives are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Ministry of Education's Stance on National Peking University</p>
<p>According to Wang Mansa, an educator arriving in Beiping from Nanjing today (the 20th), the Ministry of Education is determined to fully execute the rectification of various pending cases at National Peking University during the summer vacation. The rectification plan is based on two directives from the Ministry of Education, and the future trends are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The College of Arts will be completely closed during this summer vacation. All students in the college will be issued graduation certificates for two or three-year specialized courses. Those unwilling to transfer will be allowed to remain, while those wishing to transfer can submit a request to the Ministry of Education for assistance. The Music Department can transfer to the Women's College of Arts and Sciences of National Peking University or the Shanghai Conservatory of Music. The Western Painting, Chinese Painting, and Applied Arts Departments can transfer to National Central University and the West Lake Art School respectively. The Drama Department has a small number of students, and the director, Xiong Foxi, is not in Beiping, so it will be considered later.</p>
<p>(2) Regarding the gradual closure of the high school, the Ministry of Education originally insisted on no compromise. However, due to the strong advocacy of Xu Songming, the acting president of National Peking University, Minister Wang has agreed to consider it.</p>
<p>(3) The merger of the Women's College of Arts and Sciences is inevitable. The original Department of Philosophy will be renamed the Department of Philosophy Education. The Department of Chinese Literature, Department of English Literature, and Department of History and Geography will be merged into the Department of Literature and History. The Department of Social Sciences will be renamed the Department of Economics. The Department of Music will be renamed the Specialized Music Course, and the same applies to the Department of Physical Education. These two departments will recruit junior high school graduates, who will enter a two-year preparatory class before advancing to a three-year specialized course, totaling five years of study. Students are angered by the department mergers, and the Ministry of Education is aware of this and expects a resolution soon.</p>
<p>(4) The Department of Politics in the College of Law and the College of Commerce will suspend enrollment for one year, limited to one year. The College of Commerce can resume enrollment next year without any problems.</p>
<p>(5) The Ministry of Education pays close attention to the curriculum of the Colleges of Agriculture and Engineering.</p>
<p>(6) The Ministry of Education advocates for expanding the facilities of the College of Medicine, but funding is a challenge.</p>
<p>Female Students Oppose Gu Cheng</p>
<p>Gu Cheng, the president of the Women's College, returned to Beiping with Bai Pengfei, the president of the College of Law. After arriving at the school, she immediately convened a meeting of the student union executive committee and a general assembly to explain the department mergers. The students firmly rejected her with an anti-Gu attitude, deeming further discussions unnecessary. They issued a declaration to drive out Gu and sent a letter urging her to resign.</p>
<p>High School Representatives Visit Li Zheng</p>
<p>Six representatives from the High School Protection Committee visited Li Zheng, the president of the National Normal University, at ten o'clock this morning. The content of their conversation is as follows:</p>
<p>After meeting Li, the student representatives first asked about the recent news that President Xu of National Peking University had contacted the National Normal University to merge the high school of National Peking University into the affiliated high school of National Normal University. They inquired about the accuracy of this information. Li replied that Xu had come to discuss this matter twice, but he had not agreed. He frankly stated that the National Normal University has many problems of its own and is unwilling to take in students from National Peking University and increase unexpected disputes. He stands in a position to support their efforts to protect the school and hopes that their work will be successful soon to avoid wasting their youth. They should not worry about this aspect, and even if they transfer to the affiliated high school of National Normal University, National Peking University would have to provide funding, which is no different from a gradual closure. Why bother with this? The student representatives also elaborated on the reasons for not being able to merge into the affiliated high school of National Normal University. Finally, they expressed that if the proposal to transfer to the affiliated high school of National Normal University becomes a reality, the students will resolutely resist to the death. Xu Songming also received representatives from the Parents' Association of High School Students, Liu Tiancheng and Chen Dawang, and teacher representatives Hong Yanqiu, Li Liyue, and Zhao Xifu at nine o'clock this morning, stating that the high school issue is being actively addressed and should be resolved soon.</p>
<p>Half of Beiping Universities Temporarily Difficult to Relocate to Xi'an</p>
<p>The Executive Yuan Secretariat received a letter from the Ministry of Education, stating that the Xi'an Preparatory Committee's proposal to relocate half of the universities in Beiping to Xi'an to form a complete university is temporarily unfeasible. However, the construction of the Northwest Agricultural and Forestry College should be actively prepared. The letter was forwarded for consideration.</p>

<p>(Jinan, 21st) In order to improve rural education, the Shandong Education Department convened principals from eight provincial normal schools in Jinan today to discuss key points, including curriculum standards and training issues.</p>
<p>Kyoto University Student Unrest to Be Resolved</p>
<p>(Japanese United Press, Tokyo, 21st) Matsui, the president of Kyoto University, visited law faculty professors on the afternoon of the 20th to report on the progress of negotiations with the Ministry of Education to resolve the student unrest at Kyoto University. He hoped that the professors would remain in their original positions. As a result, all but one or two professors confirmed their retention. Thus, the Kyoto University incident that caused a sensation will soon come to an end.</p>
<p>Wuxi Reassigns Large Number of Principals and Reviews Teachers</p>

<p>Zhejiang Education Department to Establish New Provincial Experimental Agricultural School Next Year</p>
<p>The Location Is in Tangya, Jinhua County</p>
<p>Recommend Lan Jin to the Provincial Government as Principal</p>
<p>The Zhejiang Education Department, recognizing the severe decline in the current rural economy of the province and the outdated knowledge and skills of farmers, believes that actively promoting agricultural education is essential to improve agricultural production and revitalize rural areas. Therefore, it plans to open a provincial-level junior agricultural vocational school in the 22nd academic year. This proposal has been approved by the Provincial Government Committee. Subsequently, personnel were dispatched to survey the site of the original county-run Dongzhen Primary School in Tangya, Jinhua County, as the school site. Experts were also invited to discuss the establishment of the school. After detailed research, it was generally agreed that the past performance of Class A and B agricultural schools had rarely produced practical benefits for improving agriculture, and few graduates independently operated farms. The main reason is that the subjects taught in schools are not relevant to the actual situation in rural areas. Therefore, the school's name was designated as the "Provincial Experimental Agricultural School" to indicate its focus on practicality and experimentation. The following guidelines were established as the management principles:</p>
<p>(1) The purpose of establishing the school is to enable students to independently operate farms in rural areas after graduation and to guide farmers in the same and neighboring villages to jointly increase production.</p>
<p>(2) The school will primarily recruit children from farming families who have graduated from primary school and have experience in agricultural labor. Tuition fees will be waived, and part of the meal expenses will be reduced to promote enrollment opportunities.</p>
<p>(3) The guidance policy will focus on cultivating strong physiques and diligent spirits. Year-round practical work will be implemented, without winter or summer vacations or weekly holidays.</p>
<p>(4) The curriculum should be tailored to local needs, focusing on practical application and emphasizing the organization and improvement of China's inherent agricultural technologies, as well as the collection and research of local agricultural problems.</p>
<p>(5) The duration of study is three years. In the first year, students will learn general principles. In the second year, a portion of the time will be allocated for students to independently practice, with guidance from teachers. In the third year, students will be assigned to specialized practical work based on their individual abilities, strengths, and family circumstances.</p>
<p>(6) An agricultural extension director and instructors will be appointed to work closely with nearby farming families and student families to connect the school with the rural community. All rules and regulations and all ongoing matters will be formulated separately based on these guidelines. On Friday, the draft of the school's organizational outline was submitted to the 596th meeting of the Provincial Government Committee for approval. At the same meeting, the Provincial Government decided to appoint Lan Jin as the school principal. Lan, styled Mengjiu, is 31 years old, from Peng'an County, Sichuan. He graduated from National Peking Agricultural University, interned at the agricultural experiment station of the Japanese Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry for two years, and studied agricultural chemistry at the graduate school of the Faculty of Agriculture at the Imperial University of Tokyo for three years. He has served as a tutor at the Shandong Rural Reconstruction Research Institute and as a professor of soil and fertilizer science at the College of Agriculture of National Peking University. He is knowledgeable and experienced, and especially rich in the spirit of enduring hardship and respecting reality.</p>

The intention is excellent. It is now heard that the school and the program have continued to hire Professor Zeng Zuozhong, Li Shicen, Guo Yicen, and Zheng Baoning from Jinan University; Zhang Qi, a member of the National Defense Committee; Professor Zheng Xiaocang from Zhejiang University; Professor Chen Xuan Shan from Great China University; Tao Baichuan, the chief writer of the Morning Post; Chen Heqin, the head of the Chinese Education Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council; Chen Chengzhi, the former army division commander; Xu Yunzhi, the current principal of Pudong Middle School; Wu Yanyin, a section chief of the Ministry of Education; and Tang Jicang, the former director of the Jiangsu Provincial Shatin Bureau, and others to give special lectures on topics such as national defense education, production education, new European education, child education, and early childhood education, all of which are wisdoms that primary school teachers must possess.</p>

Zhu Zhongshou, the principal of the Municipal Jiangjing Primary School, initiated the establishment of a public letter writing service to benefit illiterate people and drafted simple rules and submitted them to the Municipal Education Bureau for approval. The Municipal Education Bureau believes that in addition to being unable to write, illiterate people also urgently need explanations, guidance, support, and encouragement on other issues in their daily lives.

<p>Commercial News, Financial Markets: Gold Prices Rise Sharply</p>
<p>Continued Rise of 13.7 Yuan and 7 Jiao</p>
<p>U.S. Plans to Issue Paper Money Causes Temporary Decline</p>
<p>After the gold market broke through the 800-yuan mark from the previous dynasty, overseas silver markets in England and the United States fell yesterday morning. The British-American exchange rate fell by 8.75 points. The American-British exchange rate fell by 1.75 jiao. The forward silver price on the Five Metals Exchange shrank sharply by 2 fen. Stocks fell by more than 7 yuan. American wheat dropped by 1.5 jiao, and American cotton was also cheap at 80 pounds per unit. The opening price for the hair market was 817-818 yuan, followed by 815-816 yuan. Bingxing and Hengyu immediately made strong advances. Yuanmao and Hongli also purchased and rose sharply. China United Bank also made purchases. After the opening, it initially hovered, then broke through 30 yuan due to the listing of the HSBC Bank (Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation) at "British par, American decline of 1 yuan." Furthermore, because bank sales seemed insatiable, prices rose even higher. People's minds were not firm, and they took advantage of the high prices to supply continuously. Banks also felt discouraged, and the gold market declined miserably. However, a commercial telegraph stated that the U.S. government was planning to issue 300 million in paper money. The subsequent market saw Bombay telegraph reporting an increase of one anna, and the exchange market hardened. Before the opening, there was a decline. After the opening, the Guangbang (Guangdong businesses) sold off extremely aggressively, pushing the trend downstream. However, there were occasional struggles. Bombay's second small return of one anna was insignificant. As the market closed, speculator Mr. Wu released stock, and although the U.S. exchange rate was high, it remained low. The situation throughout the day was peculiar. In the afternoon, Reuters reported that the exchange rate had plummeted because England had sold gold to redeem bonds. The price of these bonds, if converted into exchange rates, would be about 3.5 yuan (today's exchange rate is 4.67 yuan). The market should have been bullish, but there was little impact. The net red price initially increased by 230 yuan. The market situation for the day is recorded as follows:</p>

Hongli and Richang advanced to 7 yuan but still declined. Then, Daxingyong, Yuanmaoyong, and Dadecheng competed to buy, with rumors that HSBC was listing at "British par, American decline of 1 yuan." People's minds were shaken, and prices rose to 31.5 yuan. Bingxing, Yuanxingyong, and Dadecheng sold off, retreating to 27 yuan. Hongli limited purchases and stabilized. People's minds were not firm, and major players such as Bingxing, Yifengyong, and Hengyu advanced. After struggling for a long time, Citibank snatched U.S. dollars for October at 43.75 yuan. Yuankangxiang, Renfayong, Shunli, Yuanchun, Bingxing, and Zhifengyong advanced further, rising to 33 yuan. Goods were sold, falling by 2.5 yuan.

When it was difficult to sell U.S. dollars for October at 32.25 yuan, Zhifengyong, Hongli, and Zhengchang sold at 28.3 yuan. Huabi bought the same month at 3.75 yuan, and there was still room for recovery. Afterwards, people's minds were tired again, and they sold off one after another. Although the bank occasionally snapped up settlements, the market situation hardened. Hengyu, Shunli, Fuyu, Zhifengyong, and Runchangyu sold to 6 yuan. Shenkang advanced orders, pulling up more than 2 yuan. Ruixing, Shunli, Zhifengyong, Qianchangxiang, Richang, Fuchang, and Hongxing continued to sell. U.S. dollars for October were at 6.25 yuan, but there were few buyers, and they gradually retreated to 1.5 yuan. Yuanmaoyong advanced to 4 yuan, and U.S. dollars for October at 6.875 yuan also seemed difficult to sell, retreating to 20.07 yuan. Huabi bought U.S. dollars for October at 0.75 yuan. Zhaofengchang and Bingxing advanced to 3.5 yuan again. In the afternoon, the price was 822 yuan. Goods were sold at 1.5 yuan.</p>
<p>In the post-market trading, the opening price was 817.9 yuan, and goods opened at 817.5 yuan. Fengfayong, Hengyu, Dadecheng, and Daxingyong all sold.

Chunyuanyong and Yuanchun also purchased, rising to 9.5 yuan, due to banks seeking to settle. U.S. dollars for October at 8.75 yuan were not obtained. Bingxing suddenly supplied in the market, and Dachangxiang and Yuanmaoyong sold on their behalf but failed. Ruixing also came to sell. Huabi sold U.S. dollars for October at 8.75 yuan. Speculator Mr. Wu also came to settle. The closing price retreated to 814.5 yuan. Goods were sold at 4 yuan. After the market closed, Bingxing and Fuchang came to supply, indicating a further decline. The highest price of the day was 835.5 yuan, and the lowest was 814 yuan, a difference of 21.5 yuan. The final result was a continued increase of 13.7 jiao from the previous close.</p>
<p>The indicative price was reduced by 1 yuan to 28.5 yuan due to the HSBC Bank's U.S. exchange rate listing. This corresponded to a gold price of 842 yuan. According to the closing price, it was about 27.5 yuan strong. Recently, it was less than 7 yuan, a difference of 14.85 jiao more than the previous close. The registered price for this month was 834 yuan, for August it was 827 yuan, and for September it was 822 yuan. The morning supplemental price was 834 yuan.

In the market, only Taikangrun sold 70 taels of the Jinfu brand, for an increased price of 255 yuan, paid by small money shops. The average selling price was about 250 yuan.</p>
<p>Transactions in the market were uncertain and fluctuating, indicating differing sentiments.

<p>British-American Exchange Rates Plunge, Exchange Market British Hardens and American Tightens.</p>

Although banks occasionally bought in, the underlying trend was still hard at the close of the morning session. In the post-market trading, Bombay initially telegraphed an increase of one anna, and the market situation tended to harden. The situation was peculiar and uncertain.

<p>Silver Money Business Settlement Slightly Complicated</p>
<p>Call Money Market Price Remains Unchanged</p>
<p>Recently, due to the oppressive heat, most people are too lazy to engage in activities, greatly diminishing the commercial scene. The market atmosphere is desolate. Therefore, the call money market price has remained constant for a long time. Yesterday, it still opened at 5 points, the same as the previous day. There was no rise or fall in the early and late markets. The practice of adding water to overdrafts still had 2 to 3 points of action in the previous few days, but it was entirely white yesterday, showing the market is easy. Call money transactions: early market transfer of 5 million plus, new transactions of over 2 million, late market of over 500,000, small bank transactions of 700,000 to 800,000. Bank settlements: yesterday's market felt slightly complicated. Foreign banks' settlement of bills and drafts totaled 1.67 million in silver yuan, 2.45 million in foreign yuan, special settlement of over 1.9 million in silver yuan, and various goods, exchange, pledge, telegram, and other settlements totaled 5.1 million in silver yuan and 3.34 million in foreign yuan. 400,000 in silver yuan and 500,000 in foreign yuan were withdrawn from the warehouse.

<p>Auxiliary Currency is Consistently Stable</p>
<p>Yesterday, Jiangnan small foreign currency was consistently 842 yuan in the early and late markets, slightly lower than 2 yuan from before. The situation was weak, and transactions were scarce. Minor transactions: 7,500 jiao in the early market and 4,000 jiao in the late market.

<p>Securities and Public Bonds Experience Drastic Reaction</p>
<p>Long Positions' Defenses are Shaken</p>
<p>Consolidated 6 Bonds Suffer the Most Severe Decline</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market at the Chinese Securities Exchange suddenly experienced a major disturbance, with a severe decline. After a long period of brewing, the reaction was even more drastic. The long positions had built up prices on prices. This type of reaction, however, was only a minor setback. Currently, due to rumors in the market, people's minds were uneasy. At the opening of the morning session, various gangs sold off, and those exiting long positions were like rising winds and surging clouds. The defenses of the long positions were clearly shaken. Although there were still some retail buyers in the market, they were like a drop in the bucket and could not help the situation. From beginning to end, the market price declined along a straight line, declining by approximately 8 to 9 jiao to 1.5 yuan. Consolidated 6 public bonds, having risen the most, also fell the most. The second round of liquidation saw a slight rebound, but the Military Reorganization Bonds remained sluggish, and the decline was not diminished, declining by approximately 3 to 5 jiao to 8 to 9 jiao. Among these, the "No. 16" bond required 20 open, so the "20" deferred bond rebounded by 2 jiao in an unusual manner. The Consolidated Tax Bond also improved accordingly, but although the Consolidated Salt Tax Bond also improved by 1 to 2 jiao, the difference between the near-term and deferred bonds was too large, and there was no sign of a firm rebound. This was merely due to a temporary buy-in by short positions. The future decline likely cannot be stopped. It seems that the situation is no longer limited to a local event. If the situation expands, it may inevitably lead to a trend of squeezing out long positions. In the end, the market price uniformly declined, declining by several jiao to 1.6 to 1.7 jiao. Short-term Financial Bonds declined by 1.9 jiao. Consolidated 6 bonds declined by 2.12 jiao. The "96" bonds also declined by more than 1 yuan. The total transaction volume was 16,023,300 yuan, including 13,300 yuan in spot goods and 4,990,000 yuan in futures for Consolidated Salt and Tax Bonds, 2,080,000 yuan for Military Reorganization Bonds, 1,930,000 yuan for "19" Consolidated Customs Bonds, and 2,925,000 yuan for "20" Consolidated 20 Bonds.</p>
<p>New York Stock Market Plunges Further</p>
<p>The Xinfeng Jinghang reported that on Thursday (the 20th), the New York stock market plunged further. Various stocks declined by 4 to 23 yuan. Transactions reached 8.12 million shares. The morning was still flat, but in the afternoon, "damp" stocks continued to weaken, and wheat declined due to fears that the government was about to investigate speculation and because John Ho declared that if prices continued to rise falsely, the future would be unimaginable. The decline intensified, and the market situation turned miserable. Looking at the magnitude of the two-day decline, a technical reaction is expected to be not far off. Wheat continued to decline by 1.5 jiao, and brokers scrambled to sell off, with chaotic conditions not seen since October 1929. The trend of settling positions is likely not yet over, but the reaction should be imminent. American cotton weakened due to government concerns about the proportion of consumption and the influence of other markets. Silver prices declined by 2 fen, and rubber declined by 80 pounds. The Dow Jones indices are listed on the left:</p>

<p>40 Bonds 88.07 Down 0.97</p>
<p>Yarn and Cotton Yarn Did Not Fall Sharply with American Cotton</p>
<p>Pull of Surging Gold Prices</p>
<p>Yarn Market Tends to Firm, Situation Gradually Improves. Because 4,000 bales of old goods this month have already had a considerable solution, it is generally said that the factory is taking in, shipping to other ports, and selling. Thus, people's minds were shaken, and short positions covered. However, the general sellers' thoughts were to watch for lower prices, and they did not actively buy back short positions. There is talk of receiving goods this month.</p>
<p>Before the opening of the Renbiao (Yarn Exchange), many said there was a risk of decline, because American cotton had plummeted and gold prices had surged, but the calculation of silver prices had not changed. Moreover, there was still a shortage of short positions to deliver this month, so there were increases of 1, 3, 5, and 7 jiao. The total transaction volume for the day was 26,300 bales. It was found that 1,400 bales of Jifeng were sold, 1,000 bales of Yichang were sold, and 1,050 bales of Xinhua were sold. 1,750 bales of Hengchang were bought, 950 bales of Yuantai were bought, 700 bales of Senkang were bought, 650 bales of Yuanda were bought, 850 bales of Chungi were bought, and 650 bales of Yuda were bought. The closing prices are listed below:</p>

<p>Yarn Sales are Okay</p>
<p>Sales of current yarn are better. The statistics for the whole day show that various gangs bought 655 bales, and the market price increased by 5 jiao. The purchase amounts for each gang are listed below:</p>
<p>Guangdong 205, Peer 55, Changsha 50, Mainland 290, Nanjing 10, Anqing 4</p>
<p>The cotton market is calm, but the long-stable American cotton continues to decline, and the decline is quite strong. However, silver prices have shrunk sharply, and gold markets have surged, so the calculation of silver prices has not fallen sharply. Moreover, there is still a shortage of short positions to deliver this month, and the inventory in the market is thin, so buyers firmly refuse to release the amount of old cotton they have absorbed. However, there are many sellers of new cotton, and the future situation lacks certainty.</p>
<p>Zheng Biao Increases and Decreases Slightly</p>
<p>Before the opening of the Zheng Biao (Cotton Exchange) in the pre-market trading, people's minds were uneasy, because American cotton had plummeted and exchange rates had shrunk sharply, so there were still few new sellers in the market. The increases and decreases for each month were 5 fen. The total transaction volume for the day was 43,400 dan. It was found that 4,800 dan of Yuanda were sold, 1,700 dan of Tongji were sold, 1,900 dan of Suilong were sold, 1,400 dan of Taichang were sold, and 1,700 dan of Changhe were sold. 3,200 dan of Changji were bought, 1,100 dan of Rongxing were bought, 1,000 dan of Tongxing were bought, 1,800 dan of Dachang were bought, and 1,000 dan of Shenji were bought. The closing prices are listed below:</p>

<p>Total 18,200</p>
<p>Spot Sales Stagnate</p>
<p>Spot cotton business is stagnant. It is estimated that there are 900 bales of Yao cotton.</p>
<p>American Cotton Long Positions Settled, Plunging 80 Pounds</p>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton long positions were forced to settle due to the Wall Street situation. The market situation was extremely weak. As a result, spot goods fell by 80 pounds, and futures fell by 72 to 80 pounds. The Liverpool cotton market saw spot goods fall by 8 points, and futures were slightly firmer by 1 point, with some unchanged. Egyptian cotton saw spot goods fall by 5 points. The Bombay cotton market was bleak. As a result, Pingar fell by 7.5 jiao, Ormulla fell by 2 robis, and Bairuxi fell by 2 robis and 2 jiao.

<p>Food: River Rice Arrivals Scarce, Continued Increase of Several Jiao</p>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, there were over a dozen sources. Although the initial impact was flat, ultimately the arrivals were not many, and the market situation was generally favorable. Packaged rice was still the Zhu Kai brand. Prices for thick japonica rice, thin dao rice, and Du Yang sharp rice rose by several jiao. Yin yuan remained stable. Yuan goods were scarce and tight.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, there were 17 or 18 ships arriving from various rivers. Self-japonica rice departures were flat, and the market situation was stable. Thin dao rice arrivals were small, and sales were active, with prices tight and close. Early rice also showed signs of tightness. Yang Du sharp rice was slightly tight. Customer port sharp rice was flat and correct. Bian yuan showed signs of weakness. Foreign customer sen rice sales were increasingly strong.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign customer sen rice market turned stronger. Because the arrivals of river rice have been small recently and prices have been high, it is difficult to select goods. Therefore, the local street has been more active in buying foreign customer sen rice. 2,200 bags of Xigong aged Chen rice and new rice were sold at 8.1 and 8 yuan. Also, 1,300 bags of Jiangxi machine late rice were sold at 7.5 to 7.25 yuan. 400 bags of Hunan machine oil were sold at 7.62 to 7.25 yuan. The Ningbo gang also went to Hunan machine oil for over 500 bags. The total market transaction was over 4,400 bags of foreign customer sen rice. The local street bought 90% of it. After the slow sales of foreign customer sen rice in Fujian and Zhejiang, it has shown a small trend. Now, the local street is buying up more and more, and the post-market trading also has signs of building.</p>
<p>The Vermicelli Market May Be Difficult to Stabilize</p>
<p>Influence of Overseas Market Fluctuations</p>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the vermicelli market, the prices of various months showed another sharp decline due to foreign wheat quotations. Canadian wheat fell by about 3 yuan, and Chicago wheat fell by a huge 4.57 to 5 yuan. It is said that this sharp decline was partly due to the failure to properly resolve the world's economy and partly due to large-scale speculators in that country selling off, resulting in a steep decline that was unexpected. As for the local market, although the opening price had already shown fluctuations, it had a strong tendency to follow the world trend, so at the lowest time, it had also fallen by 2, 3, and 4 fen. However, because factories still had hedges for the near term and large-scale players were holding onto long positions and not selling, prices were not killed, and although people's minds were agitated, the decline did not become too violent. However, the foreign trend has already changed, and the market situation is likely to be turbulent again. As a result, this month's price fell by 1 fen and 2 li, August's price fell by 1 fen and 5 li, September's price fell by 2 fen and 2 li, and the prices from October to December fell by 2 fen and 7 li.</p>
<p>The Industry's Long Positions Hold Onto Expectations for Wheat.</p>
<p>Although Foreign Wheat Declined Slightly, Retailers Covered Short Positions</p>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the futures wheat market, it immediately showed a weak decline, because the quotation for foreign wheat fell sharply again by 3 to 4.57 or 5 yuan. This month's price was as low as 3.66 yuan, and deferred orders also fell by 3 to 5 fen. However, although the market had already fluctuated, the majority of the large-scale players were long positions and from the industry, so they had to temporarily hold firm in this environment, because foreign wheat was not yet able to come up. By the afternoon, because so many had sold off, and non-industry short positions went against the market and made advances, the market rebounded. Such abnormal behavior may result in setbacks and cannot be avoided. As a result, this month's price fell by 2 fen, August and September's prices improved by 1 fen, October's price improved by 2 fen, November's price improved by 1 fen, and December's price declined slightly by 1 fen. The spot wheat market was silent. With the sharp decline in foreign wheat, factories stopped, and industry players were unwilling to cheaply sell off, resulting in a stalemate. Only 200 bags of Gaoyou rice were brought in at 3.67 yuan.</p>
<p>New Soybeans Fall Across the Board</p>
<p>New yellow soybeans were unstable. As the number of arrivals increased and demand decreased, the various new soybeans that arrived yesterday could not be sold off completely. Only 437 bags of Jiujiang Chengmen soybeans were sold at 5.15 yuan, a reduction of 5 fen compared to before. 194 bags of Hankou white-green soybeans were sold at 4.9 yuan, a decline of 1.5 jiao.</p>
<p>Silk and Tea: Foreign Firms' Silk Sales Remain Quiet</p>
<p>(Hangzhou and Shaoxing New Cocoon Clothing Shipped to Shanghai) Since the appearance of new Hangzhou and Shaoxing cocoon clothing, the cocoon clothing collected by general silk merchants is now being shipped to Shanghai in batches. As of yesterday, a total of 535 pieces have been loaded and are waiting to be sold in warehouses.</p>
<p>(Man-made Silk Customer Sales Clear) As foreign exchange has shrunk, the price of man-made silk has become firm, and customer sales have become clear. Yesterday, only Jiahuzhou silk merchants advanced 33 boxes of unbleached Shuangque brand and other brands of July and August futures, with a price ranging from 175 to 160.75 yuan net.</p>
<p>(Foreign Firms' Silk Market Remains Stagnant) Although the exchange market has improved, the</p>
<h3>The Critical Situation in Chahar</h3>
<p>Japanese and Puppet Troops Actively Mobilizing to Attack Dolon</p>
<p>The Ping-Sui Railway Bridge That Was Destroyed Has Been Repaired</p>
<p>Sun's Troops Are Slow to Depart, Most Have Not Left Chahar</p>
<p>A special dispatch from Beiping: In order to fulfill Feng [Yuxiang]'s declaration of resisting Japan and protecting Chahar, he launched troops to recover Dolon, thereby showing the people of the country that it was not just empty words. However, after Feng's troops recovered Dolon, the Japanese army had an excuse to launch a large-scale invasion of Chahar. In recent days, in addition to the puppet troops of Zhang Hai-peng and Cui Xing-wu, who have been actively concentrating in preparation for a counterattack on Dolon, the Japanese army's Mogi cavalry has advanced to the area between Weiyang and Guojiatun. The Eighth Division stationed in Chengde is also advancing toward Weichang and Fengning, and a large-scale attack on Dolon and Guoyuan is imminent. The situation appears quite tense. The Japanese army has three excuses for preparing to invade Chahar this time: (1) Feng's troops are communist; (2) they threaten the border of the puppet Manchuria and violate the truce agreement; and (3) they damage the dignity of the Imperial Army. In recent days, the Japanese army has been releasing smoke screens to mislead public opinion and achieve its sinister schemes.</p>
<p>After Li Xin returned to Beiping to convey Feng's opinions, the authorities ignored them, and the peace movement came to a standstill. Deng Zhexi and Li Xin successively left Beiping for Tianjin. Song Zheyuan and Qin Decun also took an extremely cold attitude. The barely audible calls for peace thus came to an end. It's like dark clouds gathering without rain, we can only quietly wait for it to develop.</p>
<p>The central government troops entering Chahar have all arrived at the appropriate locations, awaiting orders to advance. The vanguard is temporarily stationed at Xiahuayuan. Feng's troops, Sun Liangcheng and Fang Zhenwu, have deployed defenses in the Xuanhua and Xinzhuangzi areas, with the two sides less than twenty li apart, forming a de facto confrontation. The other day, at about 5 p.m. on the 18th, a central government armored train suddenly passed through Xiahuayuan, and Feng's troops had a misunderstanding and demolished the No. 104 iron bridge attached to Xinzhuangzi, and the Ping-Sui Railway was temporarily blocked. After the Railway Bureau telegraphed Sun Liangcheng to inquire and learned that it was a misunderstanding, Sun replied that Mr. Feng had previously stated that the anti-Japanese army would never hinder traffic. Since it was a misunderstanding, traffic should be restored immediately. The Railway Bureau then sent an engineering vehicle to repair it, and it was not until 1:30 a.m. yesterday morning that the Ping-Sui traffic was restored and could continue to be maintained. However, the railway is extremely delayed due to the congestion of military vehicles, and the Railway Bureau has no certainty as to how long traffic can be maintained. Sun Dianying's troops have given up their defense areas in Huailai, Shacheng, and Xiahuayuan, etc., and are heading to Qing, but due to the lack of vehicles and the failure to allocate all the funds for departure, the movement is extremely slow. Except for a part of the troops that have arrived at Baotou Chaigoubao and other places, most of them are still in the Huai'an area of Chahar. Sun himself arrived in Chaigoubao the other day on the 18th. Today, there is a telegram to Beiping expressing his dissatisfaction with the authorities' failure to fulfill their previous promise to allocate five or six installments of military pay and the September living allowance. Although Sun strongly denied the rumors of "shooting a halberd at the gate," it is also questionable whether his troops can leave happily. The authorities have decided to proceed with the Chahar affairs according to the new plan, but because Sun's troops have not yet left, they are waiting slightly. Today, the 20th, Fang Zhenwu, Ji Hongchang, Tong Linge, Sun Liangcheng, Liu Guitang, Qiu Shanning, Deng Wen, Li Zhongyi, and other generals of the Anti-Japanese Allied Army sent a joint telegram to Beiping, advocating that the authorities recover Luandong and that the Anti-Japanese Army march eastward, otherwise they would go their separate ways. The telegram also stated that the bullets of the Allied Army would never be sacrificed in internal wars. The article is more than 700 characters long and extremely blunt. Judging from the situation in all parties, the Chahar affair has reached a critical juncture. How to proceed should not be far off. (Dispatch dated July 20)</p>
<h3>Communist Bandits in Southern Shandong Annihilated</h3>
<p>Communist Bandit Leaders Executed on the Spot</p>
<p>A dispatch from Jinan: When the Black Flag Society bandits in Yishui and Juxian, southern Shandong, were rampant a month ago, there were actually communist bandits manipulating them from behind. After the bandit society was resolved, the communist bandits fled to the Tancheng area on the border of Jiangsu and Shandong to harass the area. In addition to burning, killing, and raping, their only goal was to collect guns from the local militia and Lian Zhuang Hui in order to expand their power and attempt to occupy the mountainous area of southern Shandong as a base. Han Fuqu, chairman of the provincial government, attached great importance to this. Therefore, immediately after the bandit society was resolved, he appointed Zhan Shutang as the commander of the Qingxiang in ten counties of southern Shandong to search and suppress the bandit society and communist party, and sent several political propagandists to go deep into the countryside to persuade the people not to be tempted by the communist bandits and bandit society. After Zhan received the order, he decided to advance on both military and political fronts. On one hand, he actively handled the Qingxiang, and on the other hand, he personally led Tang Bangzhi's brigade and the division's directly subordinate battalion companies, together with Li Zhanbiao's brigade of the Twenty-second Division, to Tancheng to encircle and suppress the bandits. As of now, it has been completely resolved. Zhan's division was ordered to transfer to Jinan for training, and southern Shandong was defended by Li Zhanbiao's brigade. This morning at 10 o'clock, Zhan arrived in Jinan from Linyi. After getting off the bus, he immediately went to the provincial government to meet with Han Fuqu to report everything. Zhan said that the communist bandits in southern Shandong were only four or five hundred people, and they occupied the Cangshan area, six or seven li away from Zhaocheng Village, Tancheng County. They actively collected guns in the countryside, attempting to make a big move. Their Southern Shandong Third Guerrilla Detachment Headquarters was set up in Cangshan, with various pseudo-organizations such as standing committees, secretariats, and propaganda departments. Yu led the Tang Brigade and the division's directly subordinate battalion companies to rush to Cangshan to surround and annihilate the bandits. None of the four or five hundred people escaped. Guo Yunfeng, the pseudo-standing committee member, general secretary, and propaganda minister, and the leaders Liu Zhiyan and Yan Chengchun were completely captured. According to the chairman's telegram order, they were executed on the spot. The communist bandits in southern Shandong have been completely eradicated, and the Qingxiang in the ten counties has also been completed. The people of southern Shandong can be carefree from now on. This division was ordered to transfer to Jinan for training. Yun Qichang's entire brigade, Tang Bangzhi's brigade's first regiment, and the division's directly subordinate battalion companies have already arrived in Jinan, and the remaining troops will arrive within a few days. The abandoned defense area will be stationed by the Twenty-second Division, and arrangements have been made, etc. (20th)</p>
<h3>Songjiang Finance Department Approves Penalties for Overdue Acreage Tax</h3>
<p>Li Zuhua, director of the Songjiang County Public Funds and Public Property Management Office, and others submitted a case to the higher authorities requesting that the 1% penalty for overdue acreage tax be temporarily suspended. On the 17th of this month, they received a supplementary telegram from the Ministry of Finance, No. 1566, which read, "Songjiang County Public Funds and Public Property Management Office, I have read the telegram. The request to consult the Jiangsu Provincial Government for the collection of penalties for overdue surcharges on acreage tax was previously reported to the Ministry by the Jiangsu Provincial Government. Penalties for overdue payments should be limited to the regular tax. The additional acreage tax and other items are paid along with the regular tax, so there is no need to collect penalties again. If it is said that education funds are in urgent need of compensation due to the impact of the tariff cuts, the amount of losses should also be verified and appropriately allocated under the business items of each county. The establishment of business tax was originally intended to compensate for local tariff cut losses," etc. The Jiangsu Provincial Government will be consulted again and ordered to correct this. You must be informed immediately.</p>
<h3>Rickshaw Pullers Strike Demanding Rent Reduction</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the rickshaw pullers in this city went on strike because the road police maintained road traffic and cracked down on rickshaw pullers soliciting customers, resulting in conflicts. While the rickshaw companies were trying to mediate, it was suddenly heard that the rickshaw pullers were taking this opportunity to demand a reduction in rent. Fearing that the combination of rickshaw pullers would be related to public order, the authorities sent Chen Shuliang, the chief inspector of the Public Security Bureau, to convene all the rickshaw pullers at the Guanghua Temple open space at 10 a.m. today to explain the importance of maintaining order. The director of the Public Security Bureau also convened representatives of rickshaw companies and rickshaw pullers to discuss rent reduction methods. It was found that the daily rickshaw rent was 36 cents, and the rickshaw pullers demanded a reduction to 30 cents. The difference was too great, so a compromise could not be reached for a while.</p>
<h3>Suzhou Electric Plant Transmitting Electricity to Wujiang</h3>
<p>The Wujiang County Government, the Chamber of Commerce, and various public organizations, because the electric lights in the county were dim and unclear, specifically negotiated with the Suzhou Electric Plant to transmit electricity from Suzhou City to the county, and the negotiations have been successful. The county officials and merchants signed a contract with the Suzhou Electric Plant to transfer the electrical business area of the first district of the city, stipulating that within six months, materials would be raised, construction would begin, poles would be planted, and lines would be laid to transmit electricity. Currently, the electric plant has decided to immediately add poles and wires from the Mud渡 Bridge area directly to Wujiang County to transmit electricity. Yesterday (21st), it was submitted to the county government to be forwarded to the provincial government for record.</p>
<h3>Wuxi Appeals for Exemption from Business Tax</h3>
<p>At the members' congress of the County Chamber of Commerce, the Rice and Bean Industry, Timber Industry, Bamboo Industry, and Wine and Sauce Industry Associations proposed that the County Business Tax Bureau disregard laws and regulations and arbitrarily extort money. They ordered various industries to report the total annual business volume of the tobacco and alcohol industries that have clearly stipulated to already be paying license taxes and not be within the scope of business tax. As for the brokerage firms, they neither collect taxes according to the first step procedure and charge the original tax rate, nor do they collect taxes according to the second step procedure and change the original tax rate to collect business tax. They repeatedly collect taxes and make endless demands. Moreover, it is found that Jiangsu Province is close to the capital and is the root of the central government. In recent years, the economy has gone bankrupt and its vitality has been greatly damaged. Arbitrary exploitation will not result in much revenue for the government, but the merchants and people cannot bear it. Yesterday, the County Chamber of Commerce submitted a document to the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Industry, the Provincial Government, and the Department of Finance, requesting that, based on the Business Tax Law, the tobacco industry that has paid tobacco and alcohol licenses and the brokerage firms that have paid brokerage tax be exempted from business tax in order to maintain national credibility and relieve merchants from difficulties.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang and Other Counties in Jiangsu Have Average Harvest of Wheat and Barley</h3>

<h3>Yangzhou-Zhentai Ferry Suspends Operations Due to Dispute</h3>
<p>Due to rising water levels, the small embankments are subject to the scouring effects of the waves generated by small ferries. Recently, the various companies operating the Zhentai ferry service, in view of the fact that the Jiangtai ferry was attacked by farmers on both banks of the river in the vicinity of Zhangjiawei in the sixth district on the 19th, with bricks and stones thrown at the vessel, wounding passengers within, and preventing the vessel from proceeding, have suspended all operations as of the 20th, pending negotiations with the local authorities, causing much inconvenience to passengers.</p>
<h3>Jiangyin Embezzlement of Military Farms, Department Commissions Survey</h3>
<p>The Military Commission, based on a complaint by Jiangyin resident Zhou Xinglu, alleging that the Wangfu Fortress Grand Training Ground in the Eastern Outer Third Food Township originally had 305 mu of military farms, which were privately transferred and embezzled by the deceased wealthy merchant Qian Jiangxiang in collusion with the former Fortress Commander Gao Baoheng between 1919 and 1920, with each mu only paying 20 to 30 yuan, and to prevent outside knowledge, all flower households were registered as Liji, etc., the military department specially sent Commissioner Xuan to Cheng yesterday (19th) to conduct a survey together with the District Chief of the Second District. Some of the military farms were occupied by residents and some were sold off. After the survey, they will return to the capital to report.</p>
<h3>Nantung Qi'an Massacre Case Sentenced</h3>
<p>The Qi'an massacre case, which caused a sensation in the county, involved two girls seeking justice for their dead father, Liu Jinquan.

<h3>Small Fire Outside South Gate of Ningbo</h3>
<p>Ding Asan, a Taiwanese overseas Chinese, lives outside the South Gate of Ningbo, near Yongchun Bridge. The other night (18th), his sister-in-law accidentally started a fire while cooking rice, which burned the firewood. If it had not been for the various fire brigades rushing to the scene to put out the fire, it would have been extinguished immediately. A total of two thatched houses were burned, with losses of about 100 taels of silver.</p>
<h3>French Naval Commander Leaves Ningbo</h3>
<p>The French Naval Commander in China, Pei Delu, visited Ningbo for two days this time and was hosted by Bishop Dai of the Catholic Church in Ningbo North. Yesterday (19th) at 8 a.m., Pei left for Dinghai on the original warship to join the large warship stationed there and return to Shanghai together.</p>
<h3>Tourist Suicide at Hangzhou West Lake Hotel</h3>
<p>Sun He, a tourist from Guangdong, 23 years old, booked a room in Hangzhou Hubin Road West Lake Hotel No. 16. After opening the room, he remained silent and wrote at his desk. At 4 p.m., two friends came to visit, and Sun immediately left the hotel by the back stairs. The friends knew something was wrong and checked the desk, where they found a suicide note addressed to the West Lake Hotel. The content roughly stated that he was emotionally moved and had the thought of ending his life, and borrowed a place in the hotel to commit suicide, etc. The letter was taken back by the friends, and they asked the bellboy to pay special attention if he came again. Then they went out to look for him and met him in Hubin Park. Sun's mind had changed. The two friends hired a car to take him to Gongji Hospital for treatment. It was diagnosed that he had taken sleeping pills, and five remaining pills and a photo of a girl were found in his pocket. It is speculated that the reason may be lost love or a change in love.</p>
<h3>Letter Received</h3>
<p>To whom it may concern: I have read that in the Nanjing special dispatch published in your newspaper on the 15th of this month, regarding Jun's report on Chahar, etc., the facts do not match and are quite surprising. Jun's visit to Beijing this time was purely for private affairs. All the conversations did not involve military or political affairs, nor did they mention Chahar. I am sending this special letter to inform you and hope that you will check and make corrections. Sincerely, Tao Jun, July 20, 1937.</p>

<h3>China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Opens New Route to Ruiping</h3>
<p>Estimated Profit of Operation</p>
<p>Preventing Competition from Other Companies</p>
<p>Because the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Wenzhou vessel Guangji is too small and unsuitable for navigation, it has decided to add another seagoing vessel and open up new routes on the Wenzhou line, causing competition in the shipping industry. The reporter has specially investigated and recorded the details of this matter as follows:</p>
<h3>Expanding Shipping</h3>
<p>On the route from Shanghai to Wenzhou, only the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has two regular liners, one called Haiyan and the other called Guangji. Wenzhou also has docks and warehouses, which are most convenient for passengers and merchants. Although there are many Wenzhou vessels in Shanghai, China Merchants Steam Navigation Company is the largest in terms of business. Recently, because the Guangji vessel is extremely small and carries little cargo, it is not suitable for sailing to Wenzhou. The company has discussed it many times and decided to add a seagoing vessel of more than 1,000 tons to the Wenzhou line to replace the small Guangji service and implement the expansion of the Shanghai-Ou shipping industry. This matter has been planned by He Molin, head of the company's business department.</p>
<h3>Opening Up New Routes</h3>
<p>There is a large volume of goods and passengers traveling between Ruian and Pingyang in eastern Zhejiang and Shanghai. Currently, there are many shipping companies in Nanshi that specialize in this route, such as Huxing's Ruiping and Xinruiping, etc., which operate once every five days. Now, it is most appropriate for the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to use the Guangji vessel to travel to Ruian and Pingyang. The draft of the vessel is shallow, and there are many passenger seats. It can also be connected to Wenzhou. Opening this route will definitely be profitable. Therefore, the head office specially ordered the Ou branch director to go to Ruiping to investigate the business situation. On one hand, the company is planning to open a route. The investigation has now been completed, and the new route will be opened soon.</p>
<h3>Business Situation</h3>
<p>The Guangji's operation of the Ruiping route is different from the routes of other vessels. It is stipulated that it will first go from Shanghai to Wenzhou, and then to the Feiyun River in Ruian, where it will use barges to unload cargo and passengers, and then sail downstream to the Ao River in Pingyang to dock. There are no customs sub-branches in Ruiping. The Ouhai Customs only has a collection office in two places to transport and load goods. After paying taxes at the Wenzhou Customs, the tax bills are only inspected by the collection office when they arrive at the two ports. Now, the company has calculated that after adding this new route, each voyage, in addition to various expenses, can earn at least 1,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Competition Among Companies</h3>
<p>There are more than 20 merchants and passengers in Ruian and Pingyang who handle import and export goods. The various shipping companies on the same route in Shanghai, after hearing this news, have secretly signed long-term contracts with various passengers for packaged goods for the sake of competition among companies, as a measure to resist the company's newly opened route. Yesterday, the Wenzhou branch sent a telegram to Shanghai, reporting to the head office and requesting it to quickly reach out to various passengers to avoid affecting business. The competition among shipping companies for the Ruiping shipping industry is currently very fierce.</p>
<h3>Li Haifeng and Wang Yunping, Leaders of the Rehe Volunteer Army, Come to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Will Host a Press Conference to Report on Anti-Japanese Experience</p>
<p>Li Haifeng and Wang Yunping, leaders of the Rehe Volunteer Army, were originally military commanders of Rehe Province. Since the September 18th Incident in the Northeast, they have been indignant at Japan's atrocities and have secretly contacted troops and local people to carry out anti-Japanese work. When the Jin-Yu Battle occurred and Rehe was in urgent need of help, Tang Yulin was plotting to collude with the Japanese puppet regime and betray the country. They angrily organized the Rehe People's Anti-Japanese Army. When the Japanese army began to attack Rehe, they personally led their troops to fight the Japanese puppet regime and captured the representative of the Kwantung Army, Ishimoto Kenjiro. Later, Rehe Province fell due to Tang's retreat and defection. Li and others still firmly defended the Luanping area and held the danger to defend it. To this day, their momentum is still strong. However, because the communication with the rear is cut off and news is blocked, and under the severe pressure of the enemy, ammunition is exhausted and reinforcements are cut off, they tried to accompany each other and secretly arrived in Pingjin. A few days ago, they came to Shanghai from Pingjin, hoping to establish contact with all parties and solicit instructions from compatriots in the rear on the future anti-Japanese war. The Xinsheng News reporter specially met them at the hotel yesterday and recorded the details as follows.</p>
<h3>Leading the People to Resist Japan</h3>
<p>Li Haifeng originally worked in the Northern military, serving as regimental and brigade commander and director of the Chengde Public Security Bureau. After the September 18th Incident, he felt the pain of the country's downfall and gathered patriots from all sides to secretly carry out military anti-Japanese activities. During the Jin-Yu Battle, he formally established the Rehe People's Anti-Japanese Army. Because of the frequent internal turmoil, almost every household in the Northeast had guns. At that time, the compatriots in Rehe Province, because of the urgency of the situation, all embraced the purpose of protecting the country as a way to protect their families. They responded to the call with a hundred responses. With the support of local militias and the participation of those in Tang Yulin's troops who were determined to resist Japan, the number of people gathered at most exceeded 30,000. But in the end, it was still a mob, and the difficulty of supplying various supplies and ammunition meant that the troops increased and decreased at any time, and ultimately could not expand.</p>
<h3>Tang's Ambiguous Attitude</h3>
<p>Although he was restricted everywhere by the facts, Li and others still firmly adhered to the determination to resist Japan to the death and prepared to give the Japanese puppet regime a head-on blow if they invaded Rehe. Success or failure was not taken into account. This was still the case at this time last year. At that time, Tang Yulin still watched the future of the country. He did not make earnest expressions to the central government, and on the other hand, he sent personnel to Changchun and Shenyang to collude with the Japanese invaders, making round trips and openly without scruples. The people were under Tang Yulin's lewd power, and because of his ambiguous attitude, they did not dare to make any expression. They secretly gathered in groups of three or five and joined Li's troops.</p>
<h3>Arrest of Ishimoto Kenjiro</h3>
<p>On the seventeenth day of the seventh month of the lunar calendar last year, Tang Yulin's contact with the pseudo-Japanese regime was largely complete. The commander of the Kwantung Army, Honjo Shigeru, sent a senior staff officer, Ishimoto Kenjiro, to formally bring conditions and take a special train to Rehe to meet Tang. Li had received news in advance that Ishimoto was coming and thought that if he did not act again, Rehe would be finished. Therefore, he gathered his personnel and discussed countermeasures. Later, a unanimous resolution was made to send Battalion Commander Zhou to lead ten soldiers in plain clothes and carry weapons to secretly board Ishimoto's special train. On the other hand, a large number of troops were ambushed in advance.</p>
<h3>Ma Zhanshan Expresses Leaving Troops in Chahar Only for External Defense, Not Internal</h3>
<p>Feng's Sincere Anti-Japanese is Greatly Appreciated</p>
<p>If There Are Other Plans, People's Faith Will Be Lost</p>
<p>The changing situation in Chahar has attracted the attention of people at home and abroad. Part of the troops of General Ma Zhanshan, a veteran of the Anti-Japanese War, are still in Chahar. The Xinsheng News reporter therefore went to meet Ma to inquire about everything. Ma expressed that his troops only know how to defend against external enemies and will never fight internally. At the same time, he advised the people of the country to appreciate the difficulties of the central government and not to make outsiders laugh. As for the matter of going to Moganshan for recuperation, it has been scheduled to take place the day after tomorrow. The details are recorded as follows.</p>
