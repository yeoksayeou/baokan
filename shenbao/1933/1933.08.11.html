<p>日來日本關東地方以東京巿爲中心之防空大演習。實不啻世界第二次大戰之一陰影也。日本軍閥旣中風狂走。欲與世界列國爲敵。乃因其國地勢之缺點。一遇戰爭。即易受敵方飛機之空襲。於是作此大規模之空戰試演。以增益其空軍將士之實際經騐。並訓練其人民。此亦黷武國所應有之行爲。惟吾曾受日本空事轟炸。而至今空中防衛。一無可言之中國人民。見强梁隣國此種有聲有色之表演。不能不增其恐怖與感慨耳。</p>
<p>日本此次防空演習。採用兩原則。一爲以攻爲守。進擊敵軍之根據地。先毀其攻擊力。一爲於敵機飛到東京時。以對陣作戰。在空中擊滅敵軍。依吾人觀察。此兩條原則。實於其本身。先天的含有必然失敗之性質。蓋日本今日心目中之假想敵。爲美俄兩國。而美國對日作戰之空軍根據地在夏威夷。戰事旣作。夏威夷航空隊。必向菲律賓移動。以迎日機於海面。同時美國更必利用其大隊航空母艦。載飛機以威脅日本沿海各地。日空軍欲攻距離甚遠之夏威夷。及行動迅捷之美國航空母艦。似不可能。俄國則早已以「練成如大羣蝗蟲之飛行隊。於數小時毀滅帝國主義者之都巿」。向世界示威者。使日俄可戰之時機一至。海參威俄空軍根據地。恐不易爲日飛機所能接近。此其第一原則之無用也。至於敵機旣至東京上空。而欲將其擊滅。尤爲妄想。試問敵機旣向東京爲有計劃之空襲。豈有不配備完妥。以防日機之迎擊者。吾人豫料。茍美俄之空軍能至東京上空。必以一部分對付日機之出陣。而另一部分任轟炸工作。出陣之日機。或能毀壞若干之敵機。而東京之犧牲。决不因此有所减少。此其第二原則之無用也。總之。日本之易爲他國空軍所扼。乃地勢使然。日軍閥不於補救其他勢缺點上着想。一味依普通空戰原則。欲以攻爲守。此非萬全之策也。</p>
<p>雖然。東京此次之防空大演習。一方面使其空軍當局明白空戰發生時東京之危險。而知所預防。一方面使其巿民受切實之訓練。於萬一受敵軍空襲時。可以减少犧牲。其作用殊不可輕視。吾人斷不能以隔海觀劇之態度。徒稱之爲偉觀。尤不應因日本軍閥之黷武而忽略其此舉對我之敎訓。今日吾國人民。正需要此種訓練也。</p>

<p>國聞社云、昨據華商紗廠方面消息、中國棉花、向感供不敷求、是以不時發生棉荒、而</p>
<p>採購美棉補充、已成慣例、卽如去年中國產棉八百萬担、（據中華棉業統計會之調查）而紗廠方面之需用、已達九百萬担、（據華商紗廠聯合會之調查）此外如棉衣內套入之棉花、估計約四百萬担、此項不敷之數、當然採外棉以供給、至於</p>
<p>進口棉花二十年爲四百八十萬担、二十一年爲三百八十萬担、今年因供求兩抵、不足約五百萬担、且華商紗廠、因一二八戰事影響之餘、經濟之周轉不靈、外匯復</p>
<p>金價太昂國內又棉貴紗賤、相差二十元之譜、於萬不得已中、遂使許多紗廠、暫時停頓、此次宋子文部長、以出席世界經濟會議之便、並徇國內紗廠之請、乃向美政府商假棉麥、惟美棉以美政府</p>
<p>維持得力物量雖已過剩、價格未至低落、以現時困苦艱難之華商紗廠、能否因政府購得大宗美棉而開工、則仍須視成本之輕重以爲斷、至於政府購得美棉、轉以出售日商、在華商紗廠方面、僅於</p>
<p>表示惋惜而已蓋華商與日商紗廠、原處於勢不兩立之地位、彼日商需要美棉、儘可向美安福家安利等洋行、直接訂購、價亦較廉、今反轉手於人者、實以嫉華商之購用、使仍感棉荒之痛苦、以减巿場勁敵耳、故日商之購買、非因需要、而</p>
<p>出於競爭之手段而已、華商紗廠、固不敢反對政府、復無法反對日商、然政府資華紗巿塲之勁敵、未免不智、恐亦貽笑於人、華商紗廠、固仍冀所傳非確、或宋部長國外歸來、對於此種形勢、深明洞悉、易轍改絃、一本</p>
<p>救濟華商之初衷、而謀低利貸之辦法、要亦意中事也、然預料日商亦决不願儘數購買、而其爲競爭所購去之少數美棉、亦無害於華商也、至於華商紗廠、對於政府借棉之舉、並不反對、而所最關懷、則爲</p>
<p>欵之用途蓋人民爲製衣而購布、紗廠爲織布而紡紗、美安等洋行爲紡紗而代定美棉、質言之、卽人民爲製衣而造成此一重漏巵、今政府代購美棉、雙五年淸償本息之故、茍善於運用、則不寗减輕漏巵、而兼能藉此生利、夫棉價爲兩萬萬元、爲期又五年之久、政府茍將此欵、用於建設事業、僅須提出百分之一以植棉、則其效近而功宏、出產可以劇增、棉價立見持平、寗非莫大善策、非然者、棉欵</p>
<p>不知去向五年以後、又須人民擔負償還、無異使人民以一衣而納兩衣之費、此所以鰓鰓過慮者也、現政府固未向紗廠有所表示、而紗廠是否有力購買此中價之棉、而紡低價之紗、亦尙不敢預定、總須待宋子文部長返國後、視其救濟之辦法如何、而定採用之程度云、</p>

<p>中大敎授張其昀講</p>
<p>子陶記</p>
<p>第三講中小學之國防敎育</p>
<p>這次所講、偏重於敎學法方面、分爲故事、模型、會操、鄕約四項、依次說明於後、</p>
<p>㈠故事中小學是兒童敎育、大學是成人敎育、敎授兒童當以感官的具體的事物爲宜、高深的抽象的理論實非所宜、兒童聽入講故事、或看小說、覺津津有噴水　、凡良好的小說、都是多舉例證、力灦玄虛、以類相聚、願序漸進、但在許多具體事實之中、仍有普通原理一以貫之、故中小學的國防敎育、可利用故事法、使學生對於國防的基本觀念、有潛移默化之效、水到渠成之功、例如講坦克車的重要、可寓於嫩江戰役的故事裏、編入東三省地理敎科之中、當初馬占山將軍以嫩江爲第一道防線、曾將逃昂路江橋、折斷數處、後日本以債權爲理由、向我交涉、日人聲明、日軍除掩護修橋外、並不作軍事行動、並要求我方退出江橋十五里、我方以國聯大會定於十一月十六日開會、不慮有他、聽其修橋、橋成日軍坦克車重砲皆遇河、突然向我攻擊、加以此時東北土地凍結、緊燥爽適、頗良於行、日軍坦克車及重砲、縱橫疾馳、無法抵禦、據軍事專家觀察嫩江之役、中國若有坦克車與飛機、其結果當不至如此、又如歷史科講述歐洲大戰時、可插入德國魯登道夫將軍一段話、他說、「我軍於一九　八年、茍有相當坦克車以供軍用、則事尙有爲也、」又曰、「余深知坦克車之戰鬥力、惜軍事最高機關、則每漠然視之、科致一敗不可收拾、」又德國次維耳將軍（Von　Zwehl）也說、「我們非敗於福煦將軍之天才、乃敗於坦克將車呢、」坦克車在戰塲上的地位、於此可見一般、敎材與敎法之孰輕孰重、頗難定奪、或以爲敎材離開敎法、基本身的價値卽將失去、或以爲敎法可隨機應變、但如無有良好敎材以充實之、則不免流於空虛、要之、二者不可偏廢、現在我國學校多採用敎科書爲敎本、如何選擇國防敎材、頗費研究、敎本以外、尙須編輯多種兒童讀物、以極淺近生動的文字、敘述國防上各種事實、而能適應各級學生之程度、以供課外閱讀之用、</p>
<p>㈡模型這裏的講的模型、係廣義的、包括手工圖畫、此類的成績、兒童常想製造東西、故手工有列入課程之必要、一切玩具可令學生自作之、以期訓練學生之心思與才力、例如坦克車是什麼模樣的東西呢、它是一種特殊的汽車、其內部構造多與汽車相同、車外包有鋼鐵甲、以避免槍砲子彈的危險、車之本身裝備機關槍大砲、實爲、一種裝甲大汽車之變相、其特異之點、在廢除車之四輪、而代以兩鏈軌、各節鉸鏈依次相連、成爲鏈條、故坦克車又名鏈條車、坦克車藉鏈軌以行駛、有登山越嶺之功、所向無阻、非常可畏、此種新式戰具、學校可設法製一模型、再令學生倣造、俾學生得親自觀察、以滿足其求知之慾、至少亦應備有照片或畫片、使學生得到明顯的印象、又如關於軍港或要塞工程、可藉竹頭木層的錯落布置、粗具規模、表示形勢、此類手工能令學生想見其地、其效力有非言語文字所能代替者、大抵良好軍港都是門戶森嚴、附近山嶺重疊、便於扼守、有天險以資屏障、敵艦不能自海上直接攻擊、口門內外則建有砲台及船塢等、可以有恃而無恐、軍港雖非商船出入衝要口岸、但對內地段有交通孔道、俾物資易於萈集、糧食燃料等供給較爲便利、若在陸運不便地點、徒特港口形勢、甚非所宜也、要說明軍港的種種條件、最好就用靑島港的模型來表示一切、凡圖畫手工一類的良好成績、以及各種飛機模型、防毒面具等、可陳列於學校博物館中、供人參觀、以爲灌輸軍事知識之一助、語云、「百聞不如一見、」自利用電影爲敎育的工具、更能使學生得到深刻的印象、例如美國軍部所製海軍活動電影、頗爲精美、足以煥發美國人民重視海軍之心理、觀此片後、殊無異身臨其境、恍然大悟、吾國業影片者、亦宜師法此意、攝製有關國防之影片、因其具有敎育上之價値、應商請軍事家與敎育家之指導、以期盡善盡美、又如假期作業、爲實施設計敎學法的良好機會、敎員預先定一目的、擬一計畫、令學生去執行、最後則加批評、其執行手續可分爲調查、採集、旅行、實習、演講、參觀各項、要之、使學生自己活動、由自己的經騐中、以獲得確實的知識、</p>
<p>㈢會操會考制度最近已經實行、鄙意尙可厲行會操、會操爲實施國防敎育的極大利器、如捷克國的率國會、卽其明證、捷克爲歐洲大陸中一個新興的國家、其國民富有朝氣、生機蓬勃、團結力之强、尤爲人所稱道、捷克所以能獲得自由者、實由於率國會之訓練、捷語「率國」（Sokol）意謂島中之鷹、取其捷也、是會於一八六二年的創立、其宗旨在發展靑年體育、建樹獨立精神、今捷克國人口一千五百萬、率國會員在七十萬以上、競技塲在國都布拉格（Prague）效外、設備可容十五萬人、其建築費需金百萬元、完全由會員自行募集、當比賽之時、有十萬靑年男女、魚　入塲、其音樂之壯美、秩序之嚴明、令人發生無限之感慨、僑居國外之會員、在歐洲固無諭、卽遠在美洲者、亦跨涉萬里、踴躍參加、不惜犧牲時間金錢、努力以擁護國家之光榮、是會雖爲一種競技運動、其精神的鍜練、實偉大無比、所謂臥薪嘗膽、萬衆一心、故卒能養成健全之國民性、以脫難奧地利之羈絆、捷克國開國偉人馬肅烈氏（Massaryk）卽係率國會中之一人、捷克國面積略等於中國之河北省、人口不及河北省之半數、我國如採取會操制度、可視交通便利奧否、暫以舊府屬或遵屬爲單位、又如歐洲之瑞士國、雖最小之村、亦有射擊之演習、體育之賽會、而其舉行之式甚莊嚴、競爭之情甚激烈、此種精神深可效法、</p>

<p>美草地網球會在審查中</p>
<p>因流言謂梵將成職業家</p>
<p>（紐約通訊）美國草地綱球會業餘規則委員會主席卡路塞今日宣稱、美國綱球錦標手梵恩斯之業餘資格、因外間四播之流言、謂與職業界有所往來、刻正在審查之中、梵恩斯在得此消息後、謂此意甚佳、正可澄淸流言、惟僅得報酬確數之、</p>
<p>後、未有其他繼續接洽、</p>
<p>在最近過去中、曾有流言謂梵將於室外季節完畢後、計劃成職業家、與鐵爾登偕同出遊、在實際上、非正式之報告、謂梵已同意接受十萬美金之報酬作九個月之職業合同、但此說從未證實有詢新近組成之奧勃林提倡運動公司之主要人物奧勃林、奧承認曾與梵恩斯進行談判、奧亦流露謂梵曾要求十萬元之交換條件、奧謂余儕準備付十萬元之代價、但梵必須保持今年之全美錦標、否則將此數减少、</p>
<p>一般人相信謂梵去秋卽將變成職業網球家、但報酬不及此數、故未成事實、但梵流露如報酬能有相當數目、則可同意云云、奧勃林之幕後實力鐵爾登、去年願報酬二萬元之數、但梵因方勝柯顯、血氣方足、未曾接受、</p>
<p>鐵爾登柯壽路同伴出遊之實數凈得、約爲二十一萬元之數、公司主人得十一萬八千元、十一日中十次比賽、卽得此數、如果梵成職業家、號召力遠勝柯路百倍、雖付十萬元之代價、盈餘所得、必倍於此也、（八月八日）</p>

<p>— 葉聖陶</p>
<p>丨關於國語課本丨</p>
<p>今天看見余敏先生對於我的「開明國語課本」的指摘，謹答如下：</p>
<p>余敏先生說我寫着「馬托車」，這三個字照「國音」念起來，「無論中西南北的人都不會懂得這是什麼東西。」其實，同樣情形的名物詞正多，如「方棚」，「德律風」，只須其人曾經傳習，就會懂得這是什麼東西。况且，「馬達」兩字不是差不多「寫定」了嗎？「馬達」的「馬」就是「馬托」的「馬」呀。但是我願意接受余敏先生的指摘，把「馬」字改爲「摩」字，使他切近原音。</p>
<p>余敏先生指出的第二點却是他的「偶然的失檢」。我的詩歌開頭說：「牆上開朶小紅花。牆下蝸牛去看花。」末了說：「無數花開朶朶紅，一齊笑臉歡迎他。」</p>
<p>」余敏先生便說：『白話文法習慣，似乎「開朶」是「開着一朶」的意思；何以下文又變了「無數花」呢？』其實，在末了兩語之上，有着「爬爬歇歇三天半，纔到牆頂看到花」兩語呢。起初只開得一朶，經過三天半的時光，牆頂的花便開遍了：這正是我的用心所在。不料被余敏先生忽略了。</p>
<p>「窮人和富翁」本是老寓言。我因其含有「人當征服自然以爲生，而不當佔取人家的勞力之所得」的意思，所以取作敎材，與前一課「風和水」聯絡。余敏先生作另一看法，以爲後面須補充一課，說窮人「眞的去種田，耕地，鑿石，伐木，但是半空中跳出了地主等類的人，要他交租，向他算賬。他又上一次當。他再去請敎富翁的時候，富翁會告訴他：『我是耕種我自己的田地，誰敎你自己沒有地等等的呢！』」這意思很好。我的思想走了前面所說的路，就沒有走這一條路。但是，敎者如善於運用的話，我想即使不補充，也不至於敎讀者上當。</p>
<p>××××××</p>
<p>前幾天又有吳鼎第先生一文，對於我的「對於文體的收納，我主張兼容博采，而且各篇須是各體的模式」的話有所指敎。現在附帶奉答如下；</p>
<p>我所謂文體，係指記狀，敘述，解釋，議論等基本體式而言。我們用語言文字表情達意，就離不了這些體式。國語課本怎能不把這些體式都收納進去？我所謂文體，又指便條，書信，電報，廣告，章程，意見書等實用文的體式而言</p>
<p>。這些體式都是日常需用，隨時隨地會接觸到的。國語課本怎能不示一些模式</p>
<p>？前此我說了「兼容博采」，又不曾具體說明文體二字何所指，致引起吳先生的懷疑；今見此節，吳先生當可釋然。</p>
<h3 id="c232">一場變文官司 <a href="#c232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>— 何如</p>
<p>最近文壇上有一塲變文官司，以不了了之，此一趣聞也，不可不述。</p>
<p>此一塲官司，原告爲吳世昌。新月四卷六期發表吳先生批評鄭振鐸著插圖本中國文學史，頗多指摘，尤以論變文起源一節，攻擊最兇。鄭先生說：</p>
<p>最早的變文，我們不知其發生於何　　時，但總在開元天寶以前吧。（頁　　五八九）</p>
<p>佛敎經典的翻譯日多，此新體便爲　　我們的文人學士們所耳濡目染，不　　期然而然的也會擬仿起來了。（頁　　五八八）</p>
<p>此鄭先生關於變文發生時代及其原因之說也。吳先生則反之，以爲變文起於佛家之唱導。何謂唱導？梁慧皎高僧傳唱導第十䟦論云：</p>
<p>唱導者，蓋以宣唱法理，開導衆心　　也。昔佛法初傳，於時齊集，止宣　　唱佛名，依文致禮。至中宵疲極，　　事資啓悟，乃別請宿德，升座說法　　，或雜序因緣，或傍引譬喻。：：：</p>
<p>又云：</p>
<p>若夫綜習未廣，諳究不長，旣無臨　　時捷辯，必應遵用舊本。然才非已　　出，製自他成，吐納宮商，動見紕　　繆。其中傳寫論誤，亦皆依而宣唱　　，致使魚魯淆亂，鼠璞相疑。</p>
<p>揣吳先生之意，以爲佛家說法，中宵疲極，事資啓悟，而唱導生焉；唱導之時，或雜序因緣，或傍引譬喻，而變文生焉。又據高僧傳，慧遠實爲導首，彼生於三三三ＡＤ，卒於四一六ＡＤ，以爲唱導之起，遠在第四紀中葉，其唱導之本子，即變文也。</p>
<p>被告方面，鄭先生亦提出抗辯，有致葉公超君一函，載新月四卷七期。關於變文發生之時代，鄭先生仍堅持原說，以爲現在所見之變文，大多數是唐末寫本，最早之寫本，及有著作年月可稽者，皆不出開元天寶時代。關於變文起於唱導之說，鄭先生根本否認。以爲唱導文是齋後所唱者，變文不在齋後開講，而爲佛寺僧人開講之正塲，並非尾聲。且引廣宏明集卷十五所選梁簡文帝唱導文，王僧孺唱導發願文等爲證，以爲是即唱導文，因而斷定變文與唱導文爲不相同之二物。未知吳先生閱此文後，能心服否。鄙見則以爲似未必然。鄭先生所舉之唱導文，似爲唱導伊始，發願禮佛之文，非即唱導文之本身。至唱導文之本身，或雜序因緣，或傍引譬喻，吳先生釋譬喻爲故事，未嘗不是。且慧皎云：</p>
<p>爾時導師則擎爐慷慨，含吐抑揚，辯出不窮，言應無盡。談無常則令心形戰慄，語地獄則使怖淚交零，徵昔因則如見往業，覈當果則已示來報，談怡樂則情抱暢悅，叙哀戚則灑淚含酸。於是闔衆傾心，舉堂惻愴，五體輸席，碎首陳哀，各各彈指，人人唱佛。</p>

<p>吾於鄭吳，皆非素識，絕無偏袒之見存乎其間。即論此一塲變文官司，亦不敢居於裁判者之地位，第略抒拙見，就正方家而已。至吳先生爲文態度，似在陵轢他人，軼出討論學理範圍，雖所言未嘗無中肯綮之處，亦爲客氣所掩，無怪乎鄭先生不願針縫相對，以全副精神爲有精彩之答辯，致此一塲官司，以不了了之，甚矣批評家之易爲而實不易爲也。</p>

<p>— 胡忱</p>
<p>三公公拍着肚帶裏的幾十個銅子，大聲的說：「就剩這一點，其餘的都被那般忘八拿去了！」</p>
<p>我只是呆呆的聽着，對於這位從鄰村逃來的老者，發生了興趣，同時也有點憐憫。</p>
<p>三公公慢慢的抽了口旱烟，眼望着從嘴角裏溜出來的白烟出神。隔了一會，又繼續着說：「起先只是土匪，我們窮人家還不致受累，後來兵來了，借着趕土匪爲名，放了把火，連我們的牛棚都燒去了。一輕輕的搖了兩下頭，他終於嘆了口氣。</p>
<p>「初八那天晚上，本來就平靜了，昨天土匪搶刦的事，也隨着太陽一齊落到山背後去了。可是在半夜裏，忽然聽見有人打着鑼狂喊强盜，後來才知道是城裏來勦土匪的兵。</p>
<p>「帶兵的自稱是什麼連長，一共有二三十個人，十多支槍，一到就問土匪那裏去了，見說是昨天就去了，這才安下心，住在土地廟裏。</p>
<p>「第二天早上，就有兩個人來說，要我們每天送一担米去，並且每戶要捐半塊錢，算是軍餉。他又說，地方是你們的地方，我們替你保護了，這一點小義務是你們應該盡的。當時水生在旁邊插了一句不相干的嘴，就被他打了幾皮鞭，用蔴繩幼樹到連部裏去。下午，全體的兵都來了，說要推戶的搜查土匪，把居民統統趕到空塲上，他們却進去翻箱倒籠的搜，結果搜完了，家裏比較値錢的東西也跟着他們去了。</p>
<p>「後來，又因爲聽說有土匪藏在村中的緣故，把牛棚草堆空屋等全放火燒了。</p>
<p>「家鄕有什麼住頭呢？種幾畝苦田，還不夠出捐欵，：：：」他又連搖了幾下頭。</p>
<p>我望着他那多紋而又枯黃的臉，也順着搖搖頭，心裏不禁黯然的想：中國的農民究竟要往那裏去討生活呢？</p>

<p>— 秋風</p>
<p>宣傳已久的「母性之光」終於在南京大戲院開映了，我對這片子，抱着滿懷熱望，　　趕到南京大戲院，早已人滿滿的將告滿座，這也可證明滬上的紳士淑女們，對於這片子和我同樣地有着熱望吧！當然無目的而來的也不在少數丨新聞片過後，正片開始了，兩小時的流光中，引出了我無限的同情與感動。</p>
<p>自從戀愛至上主義，唯美主義的浪花，散潑到東亞以來，不少才從黑暗中，摸索出來的知識婦女，沉醉於唯美主義中，犧牲於戀愛至上主義下，直到現在，尙陶醉於愛美的迷團中的不知有多少！愛與美，不過人生的一角，不能使牠支配了全生命。「母性之光」是描寫愛美主義下的一個俘儢丨也是惑於物質享樂下的可憐蟲，這悲劇的下塲，因導演的得法，演員的努力，在國產影片中，可說是不可多得的，當然不能說絕對沒有缺點，不過我不是影評專家，不敢嘵舌，這裏我要說的，是看了「母性之光」</p>
<p>後的一點感慨罷了。</p>
<p>「母性之光」給與我的印象是：凄惋感傷，與在無可奈何中，找到了一條出路丨離婚退而辦託兒所而已。</p>
<p>未來的是狂風暴雨的世界，不要生存在這世界則已，要生存在這世界，應當如何地勇敢，精强，才不致爲人所奴。優柔寡斷，盲目憧憬，都不是生路。「母性之光」的光，我覺得太微弱了，牠啟示我們的只有柔弱的母性愛，缺少勇氣與魄力。雖然最後母女倆雙雙脫離了牢籠似地家庭生活，來辦託兒所，這只可說在不得已中找出來的一條狹小的生路；因爲社會整個組織不完備，靠兩三個貧窮人來倡辦託兒所，事實上也是很困難的。所以「母性之光」的最後結局，使我們感到他們丨母，女，前父丨都是一些淸高者，是遯世的隱士，不是現世的戰士，他們沒有給與我們「力」的啟示。</p>

<p>「這樣一個數目，固然是他們的最後希望，但是我却沒有代你答復下來，並且他們還附帶條件」。</p>
<p>「還有附帶的條件」！伯唐略略帶着興奮的神情說，「還有甚麼呢，文卿」？</p>
<p>「還有付欵的條件，伯唐」，文卿懇摯地說，「欵子在事前不必先交一文，到了果眞破案的時候，你只要預備一個代替的人，一半現欵知一半期條，一同送去，就可以「調包」了！」</p>
<p>「這眞費了你的心」，伯唐慨然說，「我明白你的用意周到，我就這樣照辦了，只要老人家不吃眼前虧」！</p>
<p>「這是我應當盡力的：並且，倘若你在三點鐘之前能遇見老伯，那就一文都不要花了。」</p>
<p>「這當然更好，然而還是承你的關切！現在就請你依了條件替我答復他們罷！現在就請你依了條件替我答復他們罷！文卿，千萬費心，我：我：：：一面趕緊籌畫欵子！」</p>
<p>「不要灰心，伯唐，」文卿說，「事情旣然到了一個地步！籌畫固然要緊，找老伯的消息」</p>
<p>尤其要緊，我也一面派些人去尋，不過我只能　在車子的牌號上注意。」</p>
<p>伯唐望着文卿灣著那個粗大的身子鑽進車子以後，立刻就找人到外面去弄錢。唉！一半現欵，五千，一半期條，也是五千，這樣一個數目，在這樣一個時候，儘管都有來源可尋，但是要在幾點鐘之內集中，確也不是三言兩語所能了結的事，所以結果還是他尋了許多票據親自出去張羅，留了之光在家裏調度一切。</p>
<p>不久，外面的電話接三連二地打過來，這都是那些親友們得了叔晋之流的通告以後，倒反而來打聽消息的，因而又呌伯唐家裏起了一種新的騷亂，添了一種新的事情，直到叔晋在外面撲空地兜了一個圈子回來，佩英才請他坐在電話跟前專司答復電話的職務。叔晋剛好坐下去之後，忽然有一個姓名聽不十分眞切的人，在電話裡面找伯唐，說是「今天晚飯務請必到。」這種來源不甚眞切的電話，一時更呌他們心慌了，有人認爲「行裏」對於那件案子也許起了甚麼變遷，有人認爲行外對於那件案子也許得了甚麼消息，總而言之，看來事體是愈弄愈趨複雜了；連之光也不敢遽加論斷。</p>

<h3 id="c236">風景區域漏與汽車 <a href="#c236" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e236" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">236</a></h3>
<p>— 瞻廬</p>
<p>蘇州人對於城中駛行汽車，心理上冷熱不同，冷的，冷到冰點以下，熱的，熱到沸度以上。冷的說：「城內可以駛行汽車的道路，只有一條半；打不轉圈子，出不來風頭，有什麼趣味可尋。利是沒有，害是很多，將來巿虎橫行，總不免要犧牲着許多生命！城內本是很太平的，不要自尋煩惱吧。」熱的說：「城巿地方，本有駛行汽車的必要，務須在短期內，拆除四周城垣，開拓一切的街道，汽車神聖，萬無阻止的道理。」</p>
<p>一冷一熱的論調，須得調和一下子，調和的方法，便是先從風景區域通行汽車，然後，推及於城巿。這麼一下子，蘇州的風景，便可以吸引着四方的遊人，雖然比不上杭州西湖，但是，至少可以挨着西湖的肩；西湖風景是大哥哥，我們蘇州風景是二哥哥。</p>
<p>說也慚愧，「上有天堂，下月蘇杭；」杭州的風景區域有汽車，蘇州的風景區域沒有汽車，杭州確乎是天堂，蘇州便不成其爲天堂了。每逢春秋佳日，我們蘇州人去游西湖風景的，絡繹不絕；至於我們蘇州著名的太湖石湖，東西洞庭，光福玄墓，一年到底能有幾個遠來的遊人呢？休說遠人，便是城圈子裏的人，曾經遊過這幾處的風景所在，也是少數。唉！枉算是天堂，一步步的落後，以至農村破產，造成一個不景氣的如此天堂！</p>
<p>假使，虎邱至光福，光福至石湖，築成了「邱福」和「福湖」兩條汽車路；那麼，蘇城名勝和風景區域，都可以聯絡一氣。便在該兩路上行駛汽車，寬曠之區，當然可以减少巿虎囓人的危險；而四方遊人的交通利便，一年至少可以吸引外來數萬的遊客，附近農村中人，可以經營負販，推銷出產品，生計旣多，當然可以振興農村，變荒涼爲熱鬧之區，所有失業之人，也可以從中討取生活，不至淪爲匪類；眞呌做「一舉而數善備」了。</p>
<p>要是，專在城圈子裏踵事增華，所有風景，由它去埋没，所有農村，由它去衰落；凡是四鄕八鎭的財主，都集中在城巿裏面，坐汽車，吃大菜，看電影這不是個好現象啊。</p>

<p>— 任培初</p>
<p>星期六的夜晚，我拐進了屋頂花園，先在各個塲子裏拐了一週，覺得京戲塲裏太鬧；說書塲裏太淸；羣芳會不合胃口；大鼓調聽之不懂。找着樓梯，拐上去，拐上去，拐進了露天影戲塲，這天，映的是：卓別林；羅克；勞來哈台的「滑稽大會串」，雖然都是舊片，但我還沒有看過，於是坐了下來。</p>
<p>第一張片是羅克的「罵鄕鄰」，笑得肚皮發痛，可惜太短，一回兒就完了，完了，又要接第二張片子當兒，銀幕上忽</p>
<p>照着「謹防扒手」，我便摸了一摸袋，再向左右一瞧，就在這一瞧之間，一位美人，彷彿跟着我的視線而走了過來，坐在我的身邊。我從銀幕上反射下來的微弱的光芒裏向伊望去，心裏不禁暗暗評論着：「美麗，時髦，富有肉感」。</p>
<p>可是我還沒有投之以游詞。倒先報我以微笑。一窘之下，急忙把眼光移上銀幕：卓別林正被一個胖婦人打一記耳光　　不防伊嘴裏噴出一口濃濃的捲烟來，</p>
<p>直射到我的臉上，幸虧我也是吸捲烟的老手，當然不必避讓，况乎又是美人嘴裏出來的東西！</p>
<h3 id="c238">喫開口飯 <a href="#c238" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e238" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">238</a></h3>
<p>— 阿絜</p>
<p>人體因爲不是實心的，所以不得不喫飯，不撤屎。撤屎毌須「藝術「和「方法，」這是人們天賦的本領，不必談起，只要「內急」便「撤」好了。唯有吃飯，却非有「藝術」和「方法」不可，不如撤屎的容易。你看世上的人，吃飯藝術的神化，方法的奇妙，便可以證明吃飯不是容易的事了！譬如官僚的吃飯，是靠着吹牛和拍馬；呌貨店夥計的吃飯，鎭日價跳跳躍躍，自吹自擂；敎書匠的吃飯，堊筆之外，全靠一張嘴吧；唱戲，唱文明戲，說書的朋友，當然非嘴吧</p>
<p>，沒得吃飯。除了黃包車夫靠兩腿吃飯，妓女靠×××飯的傢貨，十分之九，是靠嘴吧的。所以，唱新戲，說書的，俗名呌做「吃開口飯，」其實，天下的人</p>
<p>，大都是「吃開口飯」的，敎書匠尤其是最顯的例子。</p>
<p>敎書匠之在昔日，何等尊嚴，天、地，君親·師，坐了第五把的交椅。所以「老夫子」「西席」「夫子大人」等尊稱，敎書匠受之並沒覺得汗顏。敎書匠之在今日，甚麼大學敎授，講師，敎師，幾個鍍金的「都看透，Doctor也是受之不愧。其實，都是」喫開口飯，」有甚麼希罕。在常見鍍金的「都看透，」兼了幾只大學中學的敎師，挾了皮包，栖栖皇皇，奔波終日，Ｘ大學呌丨不是「敎」的別字丨了一回，急忙忙地跑到Ｙ大學，又來呌了一回，拔脚便跑。往往「呌本」弄到破爛，書裏的文字，熟極而流。學生的進步却少，敎師的進步却多，這不是很像「吃開口飯」的拿手好戲，堂會很多嗎？</p>
<p>同時，我又得着一箇發明。便是；「吃飯的傢貨是口，所以要吃飯的傢貨，也便是口。」何以呢？請你老人家做一統計，世上善吃飯的人，不是都會說話的嗎？見人說人話，見鬼說鬼話，見高於我者說拍話，見低於我者說吹話，厚其面皮，掀其唇吻。鼓其長舌，發其話匣，輕重抑揚，旁敲側擊，高低徐疾，流利木訥，口的藝術越多，飯的數量越大。試看社會上抖起來的人，不妨閉着「良心」，却不可閉着「嘴吧，」不是明證嗎？</p>
<p>不懂「處世藝術」的人却不然，心裏很明白，口裏却不說。人家見他啞吧模樣，旣聽不到你老人家骨酥肉麻的拍話，又聽不到你老人家自衒的本領，莫測高深，當然難以請敎。唉！世界上只有「吃開口飯，」沒有「吃閉口飯，」你老人家要吃飯，快快速開其口吧！</p>
<p>大腿上被伊扭了一下，雖然覺得痛，但我明白這是打情罵俏的一類動作！</p>
<p>伊和我開口了，要我到伊家裏去坐坐，這是美人靑眼啊！伊站起身來，似乎焦急地等待着我，然而不識抬舉的我，還是老坐着不動。伊催促了若干次，終於又坐了下來。</p>
<p>週圍的電炬放了光，我才知道電影完了。坐位間發生了一陣紛成。我就在紛亂的人羣裏失了踪。</p>

<p>這孩子出世時，恰巧是去年的正月十五日不是麼？當我從電影院回來，穿過院子，一庭月色，搖曳着的竹影，這時從樓上傳來幾聲小孩子的哭聲，哦！安姨娘分娩了，我想着便上樓去。</p>
<p>安姨娘戴着睡帽，頭下墊着枕兒，蒼白了臉，合着眼，躺在床上，顧媽坐在旁邊呆着眸子，小孩子呢？被裹在一條安姨娘穿舊了的棉衣內，躺在他母親的足邊閉着眼死勁地啼哭！</p>
<p>我說：「安姨娘！這是罪過的，不管這孩子是男是女，總是你親生的，今天是十五日，女孩子在十五日出世是好命！別瞧不起伊，讓伊在身體旁邊煖一煖吧！可憐的小生命！」顧媽低低地勸說。安姨娘還是搖着頭，眼中滴下偌大的淚珠來。</p>
<p>這孩子委實太不幸了，安姨娘是熱望生個男孩子，好把自己的地位檯高來，偏偏是個女孩子，這一下給了安姨娘一個致命傷，孩子哭得夠傷心！好像已懂得自己的身世了，唔！怨誰呢？怨這因襲的社會吧，母親也伏在枕上低泣，像是同情這孩子，又像在傷感自己。</p>

<p>「這種年頭兒還養孩子出來幹麼？地上的出產這麼不値錢，大麥二塊多錢一擔，養出來給他吃什麼丨喝西北風？」</p>
<p>他這樣忿怒地默想時，他的兒子阿大已經跑出來，告訴爹爹母親已經生了一個妹妹。</p>
<p>於是他跟了他的兒子踏進房裏，隔壁的銀嬸子正在替那個新孩子在脚盆裏洗着身子。女人在床上呻吟着，也沒有一個人去照料伊。</p>
<p>忽地李小毛身上一挺，踏上幾步把銀嬸子一手推開，自個兒挾着那脚盆向外跑了。那小孩在裏面幽弱地哭，打滾，他全不在心上。把脚盆放在房外，自己沒頭沒腦地到竃下扒了一竹箕的灰，裝得滿滿的。他拿了這回到了原處，牙關咬一咬緊，提起那竹箕對準那小孩的口鼻沒命的倒，不多一刻，便聲息完全沒有啦。</p>

<p>「癩頭女，娘總說是好的！」這是一個顚撲不破的鐵律。人類多有這一種通病，就是苛責別人，寬恕自己，透視得到別人的壞處，却反省不自己的不是。</p>
<p>太太口裏的丫頭，十個準有九個是壞的，比如少奶把自己的洋囝丟失了，先生的絲帕分明遺棄在跳舞塲，這災星却必然的要丫頭擔當，好像見到過一樣，說是她偷去變買香瓜吃了，對自家的人是不會想及的，更不會查究。</p>
<p>就是衖堂裏常演的孩子互毆劇，結果總雙方的大人出面大鬧一塲；有些固也責備自家的孩子幾聲，或者竟打了自己小孩一頓使氣棒，「自賺的，呌你不要同他們去混！」這語味顯然是進一步的責備對方。</p>
<p>資本家，工廠廠長，是止知道工人是十足的壞蛋，眼見在這「失業恐怖尖銳化」的時代裏，有工做，還不足心，要改良什麼待遇，請願沒有結果，更要鼓勵工潮，罷工搗亂，試問若是把工廠關門，看你們有什麼生路？全不想及廠方的困苦，所以，絕對的，資本家是不會發覺自己榨取行爲的不對。</p>
<p>自己的任性的尋花問柳，但一見妻子或你與間壁的灶司務搭談幾句，立即就會擺出正經的面孔：「你這　污×不檢點些，別怪老子手辣！」這時候，當然的不會憶念自己的淫行。</p>
<p>幾個朋友聚攏來，談長論短，誰都會指摘別人的不是處，而且振振有詞，從不見有抉發自己的壞處的招供。</p>
<p>一般的知識份子，更其玩弄這策應，彷彿知識越增長，倒把自己掩護得越益乾凈了，</p>
<p>老學究能頭頭是道的指出靑年的缺點，說得出語體文原是說話一樣的平常</p>
<p>。却發覺不出自己已成了「進化」程中的疣物，做出的文章不但不切事實。而且文法都不通，使人一看就要頭暈。</p>
<p>更有多少文人，如俗語所說：「自己的老婆總比別人的醜，文章却總比別人的好。」專門尋別人算賬，對自己唯恐捧不上天，永垂不朽。隨便打開一種雜誌來看，這樣的文人與文章總有若干個若干篇。</p>
<p>一般靑年同胞，更是責人恕已的忠實楷模，比如拿生活來講，自己已擠上了中等水準，天天在跳舞塲，影戲院，飲冰室，咖啡座，食品店裏衝撞沉淪，却還口口聲聲只顧替自己呌屈，歸咎社會，歸咎別人，絲毫不想一想在街邊撈包飯作的空飯桶的也是人，也在生存。</p>
<p>這樣的行徑，確是人類的缺陷，所以我要高呌一聲：「檢舉自己！」</p>

<p>丨一段意外的戀愛史丨</p>
<p>現在又是夏天了。</p>
<p>一別三季的夏天，現在又回來了，我覺得歡喜。一年四季，我最愛夏天，夏是偉大的，夏是莊嚴的，夏是自然的，夏是富於詩意的；到了夏，寂寞的人間才點綴起熱鬧；到了夏，冷酷的社會才有了生氣；夏暴露了大自然的美麗，夏消散了人世間的冷酷。風光明媚的春天，是公子小姐談愛情的時令，沒有我們的份；天高氣爽的秋日，是聞人雅士論風月的佳日，也沒有我們的份；至於冷酷的冬天，在書夠了人世冷酷的我們，也實在是平凡得很，最能給我們普遍地貼切地享受季候的特性的，只有這夏天，所以我愛夏天。</p>
<p>現在，夏天來了，所以我歡喜。</p>
<p>在夏天裏出現的細語營營的蚊姐兒是多麼的可愛啊！她們無間朝夕，總是在人們的身畔徘徊，唱歌，季少爺的愛</p>
<p>人的珠喉有這樣婉轉麼？王公子的「心肝兒」的情意有這樣纏綿麼？我每天從工作的地方回到自己寢室裏，她們馬上就成羣結隊親密地飛到我底身邊，當我脫去了汗衫要沐身，她們就搶着上前帮你吮吸那汗漿；當我頹然地倒在帆布榻上憇臥着，她們就過來到我底耳畔歌唱，有時鑽入我底懷抱，有時爬伏到我底手臂項頸間。天眞的蚊姐兒有時還和我呵癢，我時常會給她呵得跳起來，她這才嘻嘻營營的跑開了。我生成了一付易怒的脾氣，當我同她們玩厭了的時候，我常要打她們，他們中的狡滑的固然是撒嬌似的營營地飛跑了，柔弱的就常給我撲殺了，可憐善歌善舞的她們經不得我這巨掌的一撲，就都變成美麗的血般的紅漬了，這紅漬就點綴了我底白夏布帳子，殘紅斑斑，眞是一幅美麗嬌艷的圖畫啊！</p>
<p>我愛那畫家而兼詩人的蚊子姑娘，我更愛夏天。我願那蚊子姑娘永遠在我</p>
<p>的身邊，我願夏天長在人間。</p>
<p>讓那般達官貴人闊紳富豪永遠的在「沒有夏天」的莫干山上住着吧，讓我們盡量地長久地享受這夏天的偉大，莊嚴，美麗。</p>

<p>— 賢</p>
<p>午後，漫長如年的夏天。</p>
<p>三小姐午睡初醒，案頭的電扇，將她如雲的秀髪儘覆到面前來，她好像嬌慵無力，把頭髪攏向耳畔之後，伸起兩手，挺了挺蛇一般的細腰，一雙轉動在修長細眉下的眼珠，那樣惺忪地回憶着甜蜜的夢境，忽然想起了什麼似的喚她的婢女阿翠。</p>
<p>阿翠沒有預料到三小姐這末早就會醒來，她正坐在汽車間裏打情罵悄，小姐的喚聲更是那樣低炻小奶望着臥房門口，還不見阿翠進來，就從皮沙發上跳起，背對着電扇，吹了一陣，綏懶懶地慢步到穿衣鏡前，面上的香粉已被汗珠凝成一片。「阿翠」她大聲地喊了。</p>
<p>阿翠從汽車間中被蔡媽喊來，說小姐在樓上生氣，她以爲被小姐發見了自已的秘密，懷着沉重的心，輕步上樓，三小姐眞不耐氣哩，「死到那裏去了，快拿兩瓶汽水來！」</p>
<p>阿翠拿了汽水，重回樓上，三小姐　　又橫在沙發上，含着烟出神似的想着某一件事，阿翠倒了滿滿的一杯汽水，放在小茶几上也沒有注意，阿翠祗好呆呆地站在一邊。暫時房內寂寞得深秋的早上，兩顆心沉思着兩件不同的事。</p>
<p>烟捲燒上三小姐的尖尖的手指，回顧頭來，見阿翠呆呆地站着。</p>
<p>「老站着做什麼！」</p>
<p>「小姐，汽水。」</p>
<p>「知道了，去放水！」</p>
<p>「小姐洗澡？」</p>
<p>「不洗澡幹甚！」三小姐今天總是大聲大氣地。</p>
<p>她舉起玻璃杯，喝了一口汽水。「冰的」自語着到洗澡間去。</p>
<p>她去了綢質的睡衣，一個迷人的少女肉體豁現在鏡中，三小姐像被人偷瞧似的跳進浴盆，她重想起那甜蜜的夢境，「阿翠」她喊了。</p>
<p>阿翠旋了旋門。沒有進來，原來門不了鎖，就笑着隔門說，聲音却沒有剛才大聲大氣：</p>
<p>「下樓去聽着電話，阿翠，別給太太聽見！」</p>
<p>阿翠微笑自己的懷鬼胎，小姐那裏會知道自己的秘密；更想着意外的進欵，下樓時脚步輕了許多。</p>
<p>阿翠再上樓來，三小姐已化妝告畢，右腿架着左腿，安坐在沙發上，但是她的心並沒有這樣寗靜，可以從她轉動的眼珠中瞧出來。</p>
<p>阿翠俯着在小姐耳畔，低低地說了一陣，小姐僅是微笑點頭，站起身來，對着鏡重照照自己前後的身軀，跳着狐步舞一樣地走了。</p>
<p>阿翠似乎失望，趕到房門口，對小姐說：「要汽車嗎？」</p>
<p>三小姐投了她一個眼波，明白什麼似的從手提集袋中授給她一張鈔票，「阿翠，太太醒來，說六小姐約我又麻將，晚上還要看影戲去，不必放汽車來接！」三小姐故意高聲地喊。</p>
<p>「曉得，小姐。」阿翠的聲調也高起來。</p>

<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>我是一個普通店員，蒙貴欄敎益，已屬不少，幾日不見店員通訊欄的通信，似乎非常納悶·貴刊的店員通訊欄，大約不致於似讀者顧問一樣的停止，茲我又有一事相煩，務乞撥冗代爲一答·</p>
<p>我已婚，父母俱全，有弟四人，俱未娶，最幼者僅十四歲，尙在求學，餘均就業，進益甚微。父年五十餘，精神尙健，在鄕設一小店，糊口維艱。在往年，上海巿面繁盛，我之進益還好，家用我負相當責任，尙能維持過去。自上海戰事以來，商業不景氣，農村破產，相繼而來，貨價日益下跌；吾號吃虧不少；尤其是吾號專做外埠批發，生意一落千丈，幸敝東調度得宜，不致牽動大局。但吾等夥友，向賴年終號中盈餘派得花紅挹注；今一旦花紅希望斷絕，平時又無相當儲蓄，勢不能維持原有局面。故於去年即令內人到申進工廠作工；所入雖菲，然亦不無小補也。不料內人又將生產，屆時不免又有一筆支出；且將來生產以後，勢不能赴廠工作；爲此思維再三，沒有安全法子。素仰先生熱心敎導，故敢不厭煩凟，具字請敎；務望勿却是禱。此請撰安晚潘敏愼謹上（八月三日）</p>
<p>×××××</p>
<p>編者按：本欄自去年問世以來，謬負各界人士，獎嘉備至，敢不竭盡知能，以求有助於我親愛的店員們於萬一。前幾天因爲編者家有要事，怱促難申，並且沒有請人代疱，以至中斷了一星期以上，有勞讀者垂詢，實在抱歉得很；以後仍當照舊繼續也。</p>
<p>在目今生活艱難的時候，「生之者少，食之者衆，一是斷乎不行的。尊夫人進廠作工一事，倒是很合時代的；决不要被可怕的「面子」兩字所惑，而介介於心。照我們看來，足下的家庭，實在很可以自誇一句「沒有吃死食的人」了。除了未成年的幼弟外，都可以自食其力；即使年已五十以外的令尊令室，至少也還在那裏爲生活而掙扎。在你們方面，已經可以說是「竭其全力」了，但是結果，還免不了恐慌；這是社會經濟，分配不均的惡果。這也是因爲有人在中間剝削的結果呀。</p>
<p>尊夫人在不久的將來，即將生產；臨時的費用，事後的影響，處處使足下感到經濟的壓迫。在一班半新不舊的人聽了，少不得會來埋怨你，說你不自量力，爲什麼不採行「節制生育」的辦法。他們這種話，照編者的見解，以爲是絕對不通的。你看世界任何一種禽獸，都可以悠遊歲月的生活着，蕃殖着；難道忝爲萬物之靈的人，反而終歲勤勞的結果，只能苦度一生，連天付的傳種慾都要强自抑　嗎？而且在大體上說起來，全中國的人民是窮困的，那末難道我們可以提倡全國「節育，」以自絕於人類嗎？我們以爲我們的出路，只有聯合被剝削者，向剝削者進攻，收回我們應有的權利。譬如像女工生產問題，我們就可以起來要求廠方，在產前產後，照給工資。我們將整個的一生，出賣於資本家，凡是我們爲了生活所必需的要求，誰都不能斥爲越軌。</p>
<p>上面的辦法，是一個根本辦法，决不能在短時間內，一蹴即就；潘君或不免要斥爲「高調。」消極的方法，在臨產的時候，可以去求慈善機關（如平民產科醫院等）的帮助；生產以後，不妨將小兒送給人家撫養。我們不一定要將自已的兒子，自己撫養；只求在這世界上，有我的子生活着，就可以算爲滿足了「傳種慾」了。</p>

<p>— 禧林</p>
<p>　（二十七）這是中國翻身的徵候</p>
<p>石喬站在街角上正拿着信激動得發呆的時候，忽祗聽得爆竹聲由遠而近，漸漸好像那爆竹聲燃發了。引線似的，登時全巿都嚮應着。他起初還帶一種戰爭時恐怖的心理想探問這爆竹聲的原因，但是不及他問，祗看見前面有一大隊人，高舉着國旗，潮水似的湧上來，聲音獅吼起來：</p>
<p>『中華民國萬歲，大中華勝利萬歲！』</p>
<p>『因接着四週的喊聲包圍着！』</p>
<p>『白川死了呀，×××將軍到上海！』</p>
<p>『收復眞茹呀，攻取閘北！』</p>
<p>到處都是歡呼聲與爆竹聲混雜着，嚮震天地。小孩子們，婦女們，老頭子們全者跑到馬路上來了，誰都是歡天喜地的走出來，誰都忘記了把自己的屋門帶上，但誰都不會走進去偷竊的，這時候，只要是中國同胞，大家分外親切些，心地光明些。婦女們站在馬路邊向那些走着喊口號的羣衆不斷地搖着手帕，小孩子們在大人腿間攢來攢去，被撞倒了爬起就走，從不罵一聲人的。老頭子捻着鬍鬚，笑着摸着孫兒的頭頂，他生來六七十歲從沒有看見過這種歡欣鼓舞的盛况。石喬登時祗不曾笑得口裂開來，兀是合不攏。他沿路問着消息，問石川如何死的，×××將軍什麼時候到的。大家都肯高聲地回答他，一方面因爲路上喊聲不色，不高聲便聽不見。有的告訴他說：石川是給我國將士亂槍刺死的，有的說是大砲打死的，有的說是敵軍開慶祝會時給中國某女勇士暗殺的，這個女勇士的日本帝大畢業的留學生，會說日本話，化裝爲日本舞女，混進慶祝會正對中石川擲下炸蛋炸死那厮的，再則說×××將軍於人不知鬼不曉中領帶策略軍一仗打敗敵軍的，眞茹已告收復，瀏河一仗打死敵衆數千人，奪飛機三架，大砲六座，獲得戰利品無數。石喬走到霞飛路時，那裏的熱鬧情形更會有一番氣象，兩邊的店舖，無論南貨店，烟紙店，水菒店，綢緞店，藥舖，洋貨店，百貨公司：：：：全都電燈盡量扭亮着，輝煌得炫人眼目，全都高掛着國旗，一排望去，拉成紅藍色的直線，整齊得怪好看的，店員們站在門口，搶着燃放爆竹，劈劈拍拍，千聲萬和，紅色的火燄，到處開着花，更有許多從樓上把爆竹擲下來，或用長竹桿吊起來燃放。在下面走的人潮，一時散開來，一時笑着又走攏。火藥氣味濔漫着。馬路當中的電車裏擠滿了人，電車窗中盡探出的是人頭，手搖着，口喊着。一霎眼，又是一電車的人搖喊着馳來，他們更高唱起國歌，路邊的人和應着。來往的汽車更如羣魚一般成羣結隊地風馳電掣，上海所有汽車行的車子，怕不租洗一空了的。每一輛汽車上都有國旗，甚至有赤身大漢站在車頂上做着壯烈的手勢，高喊殺死×××，全身筋肉露出有力的輪廓，那種健美的姿態，直象徵着强大的中華民族，車箱裏面用力敲着鑼鼓。許多小孩子乘機爬上汽車邊上附着，或攀在車後附輪上，有的跌了下來，又爬第二輛。一隊一隊步行的人，也是敲着鑼鼓的，國旗的纛前後嚮擁着，看啊！久被擠壓着的民族的憤怒，久被潛伏着的世紀的鬱悶，一旦用獅吼的，咆哮的聲音，從大地的深胸裏爆發出來了啊！</p>

<h3 id="c250">德國文化電影史（下） <a href="#c250" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e250" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">250</a></h3>
<p>— 侯楓</p>
<p>「電影局」對於一般優良的影片之獎勵，有着這樣的二種方法：一，規定凡影片需「電影局」認爲適合於敎育上的目的，才能於各學校開映。二，具有標準價値的影片得開映於普通電影劇塲，對其娛樂稅也給與减少或豁免。德國的電影觀覽稅、普通規定爲票價百分之十五。然受過電影局的檢閱通過之影片，得受優異的待遇而獲得減免。</p>
<p>「拉品委員會」即「電影局」的人員，大部份爲政府系的官吏所占有，其內容包含有文化部，農務部，衛生部的代表。其主要財源一部份爲徵收電影檢閱費，其他的一部則由於發行准許證的收入。同時該會又問訊處的設立，爲應一般製造者，分配者，及民間之有力者，對於藝術電影，敎育電影，文化電影等問題之訊問。該會雖不能自己攝製，或分配影片，但因爲要矯正偏頗之弊，又訂立了指導攝製者的攝影方法，並於影片攝製前，預先檢查其脚本，同時并努力使敎師，學校管理者了解文化電影之價値。使能領導學生賞鑑優良的電影，於是又出版了敎授大綱，并實施敎師的電影技術養成所，和敎育電影的分類。　　所謂德國電影聯盟，是負有管理將影片及映機租借或售賣於各加盟學校的責任，在德國境內，牠擁很多的支部。同時牠和中央電影局又保持着密切的關係。德國的學校總數，約達八萬所，而實際施行電影敎育的共有二萬之多。　　像上述的一樣，德國的文化電影政策，可說是距離成功之途下遠了，然按之實際，則是未容樂觀的。瓦魯登魯·傑登魯在他的「死的德國敎育電影」中有這樣的說過：「德國的經濟不景氣是太深刻化了。德國敎師的加入學校電影聯盟，一方雖是有着經濟基礎做背景，但在他方却又不能否認他們是受着名譽心的驅使。有的學校的敎師，還在咒咀着他們的勸誘自己的家庭以助長學校的游戲，妨害自己的兒童：：：：：。同時我們再從敎育電影的基礎理論的立塲觀察，爲要達到繼續活動的目的，是應該先研究各種的方法和階段的。然現在的德國已經連最少數的「金」也沒有了，所以學校中只能夠將「父兄會」的贈金作爲開映電影的費用。而在警察方面，却有極大的列於禁令規定的權限，他們查閱許可證是那一種，出入口如何，室內光線如何，放映機應如何位置等規定的禁令。於是敎師爲了自己安適，便不能不拱避三舍了。：：：」</p>
<p>整個的德國文化電影和敎育電影的歷史，是一個充滿艱難困苦的過程。是一冊充滿血污的紀年表。然而自本年三月有希特拉掌握政權之後，即風傳着國社黨已在製造政治的宣傳電影。而德國的文化電影，也遭逢到重大的歷史上轉移了。（完）</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3 id="c251">評「神秘美人」 <a href="#c251" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e251" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">251</a></h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>The　Gril　in　419</p>
<p>吉姆斯頓是一個很難賺錢們的明星，這大槪是不成問題的。因此，製片家决不會錯過這種好機會，祗消事實上有可能，吉姆斯頓總得主演各式各樣的新片。關於他的作品，我們大槪不會忘記和沙麗受鸞所出演的「桃花運。」在這一影片中，我們可看出對於喜劇的演出的，確很是擅長，而且別饒風味。至於像「體貼入徵」等，終於是平淡無奇，毫無特色、雖然並不使人覺着難堪。</p>
<p>在這些作品中，我們很明顯的可以找出他的技藝上的特點；差不多每一個他的作品都是一樣，他所飾的角色常是樂觀的佻達的靑年。當然，個別的影片內容多少總有一點兒不同，然而他所飾的劇中人，却機乎是在同一個模型鑄出來的。如前所述「桃花運」的導演很聪明抓住了他的特點，使他在一個胡調水手的條件之下盡情的發揮。至於後者丨「體貼入徵」等片的作者，固然是爲了他而編製劇本，但是他不能較爲嚴肅的劇情中得着成功。</p>
<p>「神秘美人」是屬於後者一類的，他只是譜着他的老調，說不上成功，充其量是可以過得去罷了。所以在這裏我們可知道，以明星號召觀衆，固然是電影企業家最後的法門兒，可是明星的成績，並不一定令人完全滿足。</p>
<p>就整個的劇來說，這裏導演所有的能力，也祗是將一單調的故事故意使他稍形曲折的演述出來。但是分幕的繁亂，編輯的零碎，却使每一個塲面都是敘述劇情，而不是很好的演劇。這種零亂斷續的短畫面的凑合，當然不能抓緊觀衆的心情而使本劇獲得成功。</p>
<p>然而最主要的失敗還是故事的無味。爲明星的編劇本，本來就是一椿很無味的事，何况又祗能在同一的內容中翻花樣。故事中敘叙述一個醫生在愛了一個看護之後，又偶然愛上了一個盜黨的女病人，照例的才子佳人總得成爲眷屬，於是乎這一個警察局醫院的醫生便假公濟私的爲這一住在四一九號房間的女郎開脫。甚而至於因此對大盜亦徇私情。結果再來一個冤冤相報的方法，使大盜死於另一醫生之手，但這正顯出無政府的可笑。也許有人說，這就是他們自身的暴露。然而這也是幼稚的見解，因爲前進的藝術家决不是這樣似是而非的胡鬧吧。</p>

<p>— 尼秋</p>
<p>在意識上這是一部描寫一般爲金錢而藝術的人們的作品，它諷刺女人的虛榮心，和所謂藝術家的金錢慾，可謂淋漓盡致。</p>
<p>本片的演員都很努力，陳燕燕演一個受了虛榮洗禮的少女，態度很自然。　　黎灼灼的作風變得很好，可惜前半部缺少機會、表演不免重複些、她對於小梅的行爲很能做出做母親的苦在肚裏，當她聽到家瑚述及苦役的情形時，一種內心的憐愛表演，完全被她做到了。　　多燄在本片的作風，很像諾伐羅在Ben　Hur一片裏的表演，革命的熱情充滿全身，遇到小梅時一種隱在背後的父愛，演來也很眞誠。</p>
<p>其他幾位配角也都合身份，劉繼羣，韓蘭根，殷岑秀三人的一點穿插像拍手，脫帽，擲花藍等都很新頴。</p>
<p>導演的努力在本片裏是更顯著的，幾個鏡頭像鄒先生忍住淚別了小梅而去，在出門的地方摸出手帕來。劉，韓，殷三人的看報，及當母親登輪出洋去看女兒的時候，碼頭上祗有父親在送等都很能予觀衆以深刻的印像。</p>
<p>字幕在本片裏確實爲本片生色勿少，如寄梅問鄒先生在南洋是否發了財回來，鄒先生的回答說出了世界經濟的不景氣，以及今日華僑在海外的地位和所受的壓迫等，確是很有意義。</p>
<p>其他如最後的一支歌收音還好，攝影是比「除夕」好，黃紹芬的技術，確也有十足的進步。</p>
<h3 id="c253">「母性之光」觀後感 <a href="#c253" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e253" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">253</a></h3>
<p>— 羅平</p>
<p>在這樣一個病態的社會裏，受了經濟的壓迫，一個沒了丈夫的女人帶了孩子去再嫁別人是很普遍的事實。</p>
<p>當然，這個再嫁的理由不一定是爲虛榮和享樂，而是爲了自身的生存，也爲了孩子的生存才這樣的。假使說慧英爲了享樂和虛榮而再嫁，那末她很可以丟掉她的孩子，這一點我們可以看出母性所特有的愛來。</p>
<p>慧英的這一顆心永久繫住在小梅身上的，然而，她的女兒受了父親的敎養，同時她自身受了物質和虛榮的迷惑，定要嫁給有錢的人作妻子，對於母親的親切的愛却絲毫不能領會到。但當她臥病在南洋時，她的母親還特地設法了錢，隻身趕到南洋去看她，這又可以顯出了一種母性所特有的偉大的愛來。</p>
<p>在現實社會裏，男女間的「愛」在一些人的嘴巴上，是神聖不可侵犯的，在一些人的字面上，就是他們的生命，然而實際上女人只是被公子哥兒當做玩具，黃書麟的遺棄小梅是這個社會制度下必然的現象。因此，在小梅揭穿了有錢人的假面具和生了兒子以後，她就會確實地領會到男女之愛和母性之性，誰是神聖的，偉大的，親切的。所以「母性之光」不但不爲封建說敎，而且還淸楚地說明了這個社會裏的一切。</p>
<h3 id="c254">談談「母性之光」 <a href="#c254" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e254" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">254</a></h3>
<p>— 湘</p>
<p>「母性之光」的演員方面，陳燕燕飾小梅，表演有驚人的進步，一舉一動都能適合劇中人的身份，得到了相當的成功。黎灼灼飾小梅的母親，改變了作風，雖然有些地方過於呆板，但也算不錯。金燄飾的家瑚，表演也很深刻，可是魯史飾的寄梅，却太嫌做作。何非光，李君磐，　瑛等也都不錯，在大體上，演員們還算能適合劇中人的個性和身份。</p>
<p>在劇情方面，小梅灌的唱片雖然家誦戶曉，但我想决不會連老頭子和女傭都跟着音樂舞蹈，這是太過分而非現實的描寫了！</p>
<p>黃書麟南洋的住宅裏的女傭，裝束似乎不應該像上海的女傭一樣，這點我以爲也是一個很小的毛病。</p>
<p>在攝影方面，有些地方光綫欠柔和，但也有好幾個鏡頭很使人滿意的。</p>
<p>其他如劉繼羣，韓蘭根，殷秀岑的滑稽穿插，小梅的女兒蓮絳，由一個活潑可愛的幼孩演出，托兒所內孩童的天眞爛漫，末段美麗的小鳥唱的「母性之光」等，都能使這片子增加精彩。</p>
<p>總之，這張片子，顯露出母性之愛的偉大，實可稱爲不可多得的國片。</p>

<p>他想何必拒人於千里之外，亦無妨助以一臂之力。於是他就答應非答應的和伊蘩深切的交談起來。後來海傑斯就很有意思要向意士頓或西摩保薩摩保薦她一下。</p>
<p>這時候忽然走進來一位金髪的女郎。他氣槪得很，那些坐公事房外面的許多人，都不在她的眼中。她進來了，一直就往裏走。伊蘩一面問着「這是誰」？一面估量着她，覺得這女子驕傲虛浮。那女子走過海傑斯的面前，海傑斯很恭敬地站了起來，向她鞠躬，但她不過似睬不睬的點了點頭。意士頓的助手西摩先生自已出來迎接着那女子進去了。伊蘩很不耐煩似的再問着那海傑斯到底那個女子是誰，他會不會作戲。海傑斯告訴她道：「好是麗妲華儂。當然她會作戲的。」可是海傑斯說話的神氣，是冷冷的。他又說道：「她有表演的天才，可是運氣亦太好了。她的前程是很遠大的，可惜太驕傲容縱了些」。</p>
<p>在那公事房的裏間，那驕縱慣了的麗妲華儂正在那裏向意士頓頒佈着命令；而著作家薛立丹呢，明知他和麗妲華儂的意見很深，所以躱在公事房旁邊的浴室裏。照他的意思是不情願麗妲華儂加入他排的戲，不過爲了意士頓的緣故，他不便堅决地反對，而意士頓呢，亦並不怎樣佩服麗妲華儂，不過覺得她還有些號召力。現在所排演的「靑天」，是不能不讓　妲華儂作主角的了。但薛立丹總希望在他最近翻譯摩那所著的「金枝」裏，能夠覓得一個相當的主角，那他就可以一舉成名了。他儘可讓「靑天」給麗妲華儂去作主角，但將來「金枝」排演的時候，他萬萬不能再讓步了。</p>
<p>但是這還不過係薛立丹一己的空想。他還沒有聽見麗妲華濃向意士頓指導下　的哀的美敦書呢。她向意士頓提出的條件是：她現在接收「靑天」主角的地位，但此後「靑天」完結了，再排什麼戲，去什麼角色，應由她自己選擇·意士頓沒有法子，祗好答應了她。他想「靑天」排演還要費不少日子。到後來排演「金枝」的時候，再想別的法子好了。他將那主角送走了，深深歎了一口氣。</p>
<p>麗妲華儂出去了，意士頓連忙請薛立丹出來；但是薛立丹脚剛走出浴室的門，麗妲又進來了，弄得薛立丹進退維谷，很難爲情。（未完）</p>

After Deng arrived in Zhangjiakou, Feng talked to Deng about planning to order him to lead his troops to station south of Zhangjiakou to deal with the Central Army. Deng immediately resolutely stated that the guns would never be pointed inward. Feng was unable to refute him on the surface at the time, but secretly hated Deng very much.

<p>(Tianjin) Tianjin City is located at the estuary of various rivers in the Hebei border area. The weather has been cloudy and rainy in recent days, and the river water has been rising. Flood control in the city is extremely important. The Public Works Bureau has specially joined forces with the Provincial Public Security Bureau, Tianjin County Government, North China Water Conservancy Association, Haihe Remediation Committee, and various agencies to organize a flood control association to ensure safety. The city government has allocated 7,000 yuan to carry out repairs. According to relevant sources, there are no major problems with the river embankments in the city.

<p>(Nanjing) According to a certain agency, the government intends to pool national income and change the Ministry of Finance to the Ministry of Economic Affairs, taking overall control of the nation's economy and carrying out large-scale construction.

<p>(Nanjing) Hunan Province made an agreement with Shanghai banking circles for a ten million loan to build the Hongjiang-Taohuaping light railway. The people of Hunan feel very uneasy. A reporter met with He Yaozu and Tang Shengzhi, members of the Hunan Provincial Committee, on the tenth to inquire about the truth. They said that they did not oppose building roads, but they opposed unplanned waste. The Hongtao Road is definitely not something that can be done with ten million. If it is abandoned halfway, the money will be wasted. Although it is called a ten million loan, after removing old debts and large rebates, there will be only four million left, and the annual interest of 600,000 will increase the burden on the people. Moreover, railways are nationally owned in order to be systematic. If the province acts on its own, the consequences will be disastrous. (10th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>Britain and Spain Ask the US to Be Responsible for Protecting Overseas Chinese</p>
<p>(New York) President Roosevelt issued a document urging Cuba not to engage in political disputes. This document is a warning, issued to the Cuban ambassador to the United States. The document states: The problems of popular starvation and economic decline are of utmost importance at the moment. Even if there are political problems, they should be dealt with in a patriotic spirit, with the aim of improving various situations in the shortest possible time. Unofficial circles believe that this document is intended to satirically order Machado to give way if he cannot govern the country peacefully. It is generally believed that President Roosevelt is now planning emergency measures to restore order in Cuba, but there is absolutely no indication of wanting to intervene by force. Telegrams are constantly being exchanged to learn all the details of the situation. Dr. Sinda, the Cuban ambassador to the United States, has now left Washington and gone to New York.

<p>The British and Spanish Diplomatic Representatives in Cuba</p>
<h3 id="e27">Submit a Protest to the US <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>Complaining About the Losses Suffered by Overseas Chinese</p>
<p>According to the Supplementary Clause of the US-Cuba Treaty</p>
<p>The US Should Be Responsible for Protecting Foreigners</p>
<p>It Is Nothing More Than Urging the US to Intervene Quickly</p>
<p>Havana News tonight from reliable sources: The British and Spanish diplomatic representatives protested to the US Ambassador Wells about Cuban strikers destroying the property of overseas Chinese from their respective countries, and that both sides of the Cuban political strife were mistreating overseas Chinese from their respective countries. It is said that the purpose of this protest is to believe that due to the existing relationship between Cuba and the United States, the United States should be responsible for maintaining order and law in Cuba. When the Cuban government cannot protect foreigners, the United States should protect them on its behalf. Most observers here believe that the protest is indeed true, believing that this move is nothing more than the European powers re-expressing their recognition of the rights of the United States in Cuba. That is to say, Spain, which once possessed Cuba, and the United Kingdom, which has huge investments in Cuba, will welcome US intervention. This policy of the two countries has a long history. It not only recognizes the existence of the Monroe Doctrine, but also wants to rely on the United States to protect its overseas Chinese, so the United Kingdom had the same move when the Nicaraguan turmoil was raging some time ago. Moreover, this move also strictly abides by Rodd's interpretation of the Platt Amendment to the US-Cuba Treaty. Rodd once said that the European powers would certainly not question the intervention of the United States in accordance with the Platt Amendment, especially the intervention of the United States in accordance with Article 3 of the said amendment. Article 3 stipulates that the United States reserves the right to intervene if Cuba raises public debt that is not repaid by unusual income. In addition, the other articles require Cuba to maintain order. Now that Cuba's unusual income is no longer able to repay the debt, and the country is in turmoil and unable to maintain order, the United States can intervene in accordance with the amendment. However, President Roosevelt, like his predecessor President Hoover, is still hesitant to intervene in Cuba, fearing that any action will affect the relationship between the United States and Latin America. At present, diplomatic representatives from various countries here are closely watching the situation, waiting for a statement from Washington. It is reported that Cuban Ambassador to the United States Sinda discussed with the US President for a long time, and then telephoned the Cuban President with the results. Also, Cuban Secretary of State Forara met with several revolutionary leaders in New York and Miami, and suddenly returned to the capital today. After landing, he declared that the revolutionary crisis had passed, and then went to see the President. It is generally believed that these two events are sufficient to show that Washington has made a definite proposal for the Cuban President to step down. However, Cuban President Machado signed an order immediately after seeing Forara, declaring that the country has entered a state of war (i.e., martial law), and that the Cuban federal army will take over all police affairs, because the police are no longer able to maintain law and order. It is generally believed that this order is Machado's response to the proposal to step down. The strike wave is still going on today. The rumors that thousands of people would return to work last night have proved to be untrue. Machado's application to immediately resume work in order to preserve sovereignty and avoid US intervention has not taken effect. As for the American overseas Chinese here, there were two claims a few days ago. One faction believes that the Cuban government is no longer able to maintain order, and advocates immediate intervention in accordance with the Platt Amendment to the US-Cuba Treaty. The other faction believes that according to the spirit of the supplementary articles, the United States can only intervene when Cuba falls into a state of anarchy or is invaded by a foreign country. However, today, in view of the fact that the US investment of 1.75 billion yuan in Cuba will be in danger due to economic collapse, the latter faction also advocates intervention.

<p>(Washington) The US Ambassador to Cuba, Wells, again reported the situation in Cuba to the State Department by telephone this morning, saying that the situation is worse than before, and Machado is still refusing to resign. The representatives of the State Department still oppose any form of intervention, but it is generally believed that if Machado hinders all solutions, President Roosevelt may allow intervention, but it is not known. At present, the closest US warships to Cuba are one cruiser and two destroyers within the Panama Canal Zone. Roosevelt's cousin, the assistant secretary of the Navy, is currently somewhere in the Pacific Ocean, not far from the Panama Canal. The only US Navy ship in Cuban waters is a tugboat.

<p>(Washington) U.S. Army and Navy officials tonight stated that plans for the military occupation of Cuba in an emergency have been prepared for many years. With the help of the two naval coaling ports leased by the United States in Cuba, it would not be difficult to control major cities within 24 hours. If the United States decides to intervene, the first to launch the action may be the Marine Corps, which Cuban President Machado says he is happy to deal with.</p>
<p>As for the State Department's attitude towards the U.S. President, there has been no expression. It only stated that when the U.S. President met with Cuban Ambassador Cintas at Hyde Park, he told him that Cuba should stop political disputes to avoid driving the whole country into famine. This statement by the U.S. President has been delivered to the Cuban President. However, according to what has been heard outside, the U.S. President is indeed willing to avoid intervention, but he is gradually becoming impatient. If peace is not restored in Cuba, some drastic action will soon be taken, and this action is currently under consideration. As for the U.S. President's statement to the Cuban Ambassador, there was no hint that Machado should step down. (10th National Telegram)</p>

<p>President Machado has issued an order declaring a state of war throughout Cuba. Troops have been deployed to guard all key locations.

<p>(New York) The possibility of American intervention in Cuba has increased compared to before, as the situation has not progressed. President Machado will decide today whether to accept the informal suggestion of the American ambassador. The American ambassador believes that the Cuban president should take a long leave of absence and appoint a proxy; otherwise, disaster will strike, order will disappear, and the United States will inevitably intervene. Yesterday, military police at the presidential palace opened machine-gun fire on the public, killing 20 people and injuring hundreds. This incident has aroused public outrage. Today, the president still refuses to resign and is adopting strict measures to maintain his position, which has further inflamed public resentment. Today, riots broke out in the streets of the Cuban capital, and more bloodshed occurred. In clashes between police and the public, two police officers were shot and seriously injured, and are expected to die. Two others were slightly injured. Inland transportation is blocked, and there are reports of disturbances and several deaths. (9th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Havana) Foreign Minister Fan Riera returned here this morning and immediately met with President Machado. Machado's adoption of a tough stance seems to be due to a misrepresentation by Cuban Ambassador Cintas in the United States regarding President Roosevelt's true intentions. U.S. Ambassador Welles has asked the Cuban President to respond to the memorandum he sent within a certain period. He has also asked Cintas to convey Roosevelt's views on Welles' actions to Machado within a certain period. Stable officers in the Cuban army believe that armed resistance is close to madness, but the literary figures around Machado, because the president's staying or leaving is related to their life and death, seem to believe that force is still effective. Politicians with a longer-term perspective hope that Foreign Minister Fan Riera can persuade Machado to understand the truth. (9th Havas Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) One aircraft that attacked Tokyo last night and whose whereabouts were unknown was found today within the territory of the hypothetical enemy. The engine of this aircraft was damaged, and it was forced to land. The second day of air exercises began at 8:30 this morning. At that time, aircraft attacked Tokyo again, and sirens and alarms sounded all at once. Shortly afterwards, the sound of anti-aircraft guns and machine guns on high rooftops was heard everywhere, announcing the progress of the aerial warfare. Soon, enemy aircraft appeared in the sky above the center of Tokyo, and at the same time, explosions and smoke indicated the locations where bombs had been dropped. (10th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Last night, the first day of the Kanto air defense exercises, at 8:17, two enemy aircraft suddenly attacked the sky above the imperial capital from the direction of Miura. Upon receiving the alarm, lights were immediately controlled. The imperial capital suddenly became a dark world. At the same time, the anti-aircraft guns installed everywhere began to fire fiercely from their positions. The enemy aircraft retreated in a panic. They attacked again at 10 p.m. Because of the skillful Japanese air defense tactics, they could not use their skills and gave up bombing empty-handed. Therefore, the results of the first day of the exercises were very good. (10th Dentsu Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) On the second day of the air defense exercises in the imperial capital, an enemy fleet with aircraft carriers appeared in the sea west of Ogasawara Island this morning before dawn. Upon receiving this first report, the entire city became very tense. At 8:15, enemy aircraft attacked from north of Mito, and the air battle began. At 9:27, three enemy aircraft flew over the headquarters of the Defense Command, and poison gas bombs rained down. Commander Hayashi and others wore gas masks, and the anti-aircraft machine gun teams all began firing. At 10:20, after fierce fighting, the enemy aircraft were repelled. At 11:19, fifteen enemy aircraft attacked again, and the imperial capital was in a dangerous state. The main buildings on the ground were covered with smoke to confuse the enemy aircraft. At that time, air defense aircraft also took off. As a result, after a fierce attack, the enemy aircraft were completely repelled by 1 p.m. (10th Dentsu Dispatch)</p>

The current position of the U.S. will weaken its power to demand the maintenance of the current ratio, and in view of the current world situation, which is already buried with explosives, there is even more need for large-scale shipbuilding.

<p>Internal Government Factions in Opposition</p>
<p>Leadership Wants to Seek Participation in Technical Cooperation</p>
<p>Hardliners Advocate Implementing Original Policy</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs is paying close attention to Song Ziwen's actions. Foreign Minister Uchida telegraphed Ambassador Debuchi to investigate the content of the Song-Luo meeting, but no accurate report has been received so far. It is said that opinions within the Japanese government are divided into two types regarding our technical cooperation with the League of Nations, namely, the opinions of the government's leadership, such as Uchida and Araki, and the opinions of the military and foreign affairs hardliners on China. The claims of the two factions are listed below: (A) The government's leadership's China policy: (i) To launch a second Manchurian Incident against China is definitely a foolish move given the current state of Japan's finances and economy. (ii) If we act recklessly regardless of the pros and cons, it will definitely trigger a war between Japan and the world. No matter how excellent Japan's military equipment is, it will definitely not be able to win on the battlefield. (iii) Although Song Ziwen's diplomacy in the United States was successful, his campaign in Europe, according to news received by the military and foreign affairs departments, is that although Britain, France, Italy, and Germany did not accept Japan's protest, the authorities of each country have reportedly proposed to Song Ziwen to persuade China to tolerate Japan's participation in technical cooperation, but Song Ziwen has not indicated acceptance of this proposal. Since the internal situation in European countries is like this, we can still use diplomatic means to participate in cooperation. Therefore, at present, it is still wise not to provoke European countries with military action. (iv) Song Ziwen's background is in the capitalists of Jiangsu and Zhejiang. The capitalists of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, like Japanese capitalists, are tired of war. Therefore, Song Ziwen may not dare to adopt a diplomatic policy of military resistance against Japan after returning to China. Based on the various reasons listed on the left, the Japanese government's leadership wants to adopt a peaceful policy to deal with China, but the young military officers of the military, the young and middle-aged factions of the military system of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the civilian fascists advocate using tough measures. The reasons they advocate are listed on the left: (i) The capital power of European and American countries is expanding in China, which is detrimental to Japan's future China policy (the so-called continental policy). (ii) In China, which is currently experiencing extreme financial difficulties, if we do not make China submit at this time, a good opportunity will be lost, and it may be difficult to get such an opportunity again in the future. (iii) At a time when European and American strength is insufficient and we must avoid war, it is an excellent opportunity to eliminate European and American forces in China. Japan should use this opportunity to force peace through war and prevent European and American investment in China. (iv) Even if Japan participates in technical cooperation, the result is still to help China expand its military equipment. We may be able to seek temporary peace at present, but the world situation in three years will definitely be unfavorable to Japan. The young officers of the army oppose the government's policy for the reasons mentioned above and collude with the news section of the Ministry of the Army and various newspapers and news agencies to vigorously promote that Japan will not hesitate to stage a second Manchurian Incident to achieve its established China policy. This is the internal situation of the Japanese government's China policy. (10th Hualian Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e42">The Tokyo Air Defense Exercises • Zi <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>The recent air defense exercises in the Kanto region of Japan, centered on Tokyo, are nothing short of a shadow of World War II. The Japanese warlords are acting like madmen, wanting to be enemies with the countries of the world. Because of the shortcomings of their country's topography, they are easily attacked by enemy aircraft in the event of war. Therefore, they are conducting this large-scale air combat rehearsal to increase the practical experience of their air force generals and soldiers and to train their people. This is also the behavior that a militaristic country should have. However, we, the Chinese people who have suffered from Japanese aerial bombardment and who have nothing to say about air defense to this day, cannot help but increase our terror and emotion upon seeing such a lively performance by a powerful neighboring country.</p>
<p>The Japanese air defense exercises this time adopt two principles. One is to defend by attacking, attacking the enemy's base and destroying its attacking power first. The other is to engage in combat when enemy aircraft fly to Tokyo, destroying the enemy in the air. According to our observations, these two principles inherently contain the nature of inevitable failure for themselves. Today, Japan's imaginary enemies are the United States and Russia. The air force base for the United States to fight against Japan is in Hawaii. Once the war starts, the Hawaiian Air Force will definitely move to the Philippines to meet Japanese aircraft on the sea. At the same time, the United States will inevitably use its large fleet of aircraft carriers to threaten various coastal areas of Japan. It seems impossible for the Japanese air force to attack Hawaii, which is very far away, and the fast-moving American aircraft carriers. Russia has long declared to the world, "Training a flight team like a large swarm of locusts to destroy the cities of the imperialists in a few hours." When the opportunity for Japan and Russia to fight arrives, the Russian air force base in Vladivostok may not be easily approached by Japanese aircraft. This is the uselessness of their first principle. As for wanting to destroy enemy aircraft after they have arrived in the skies above Tokyo, it is even more wishful thinking. May I ask, if enemy aircraft are conducting a planned air raid on Tokyo, would they not be fully equipped to defend against Japanese aircraft attacks? We predict that if the air forces of the United States and Russia can reach the skies above Tokyo, they will definitely use a portion to deal with the Japanese aircraft taking off, while the other portion will be responsible for the bombing work. The Japanese aircraft that take off may be able to destroy some enemy aircraft, but Tokyo's sacrifices will definitely not be reduced as a result. This is the uselessness of their second principle. In short, Japan's susceptibility to being strangled by the air forces of other countries is due to its topography. Japanese warlords should not think about remedying other shortcomings and blindly rely on ordinary air combat principles to defend by attacking. This is not a perfect strategy.</p>
<p>Although, the air defense exercises in Tokyo this time, on the one hand, allow the air force authorities to understand the dangers of Tokyo in the event of air combat and to know what to prevent, and on the other hand, allow its citizens to receive practical training so that they can reduce sacrifices in the event of an enemy air raid. Its role should not be underestimated. We must not take a theatrical attitude from across the sea and call it a spectacle. Furthermore, we should not ignore the lessons for us from this move due to the militarism of the Japanese warlords. Today, the people of our country are in need of this kind of training.</p>

<p>Japanese Businesses Severely Affected</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to information obtained by the Nanyo Kyokai (South Seas Association), extreme anti-Japanese sentiment has recently arisen in the Dutch East Indies. Traders involved in South Seas relations are very angry because the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Bureau of Commerce has abandoned its responsibility. When the Dutch East Indies, under the guise of protecting domestic industries, imposed extreme import restrictions on cement imported from Japan, limiting the import volume from 600,000 barrels last year to 300,000 barrels this year,</p>
<p>Related traders had called the attention of the Bureau of Commerce and requested appropriate countermeasures. However, the Bureau of Commerce stated that the Dutch East Indies Governor's restrictions only applied to cement imports and did not affect other commodities. It was said that adopting a tough stance at this time would be unfavorable, and the matter was dropped. Subsequently, the Dutch East Indies Governor implemented general and broad import restrictions, and there was a move to pass the import restriction order through the National Assembly. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Bureau of Commerce stood by and watched, without thinking of a way to deal with it. It can only be said that it was a mistake. The Japanese goods most severely affected by the import restrictions are cotton yarn and beer. Cotton yarn imported from Japan accounts for 70% of the total import volume of 18,560,000 guilders. The Nanyo Kyokai does not trust the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Association Director Iizumi Ryosaburo is rushing there on the Chiyoda Maru to promote trade. (10th DenTsushin Dispatch)</p>
<p>The Second to Last Stop on the Return Trip</p>
<h3 id="e77">Italian Air Fleet Arrives in Lisbon <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>Only One of Twenty-Four Aircraft Lost, Performance Can Be Considered Satisfactory</p>
<p>The Azores Islands Need to Establish an International Airport</p>
<p>▲Reuters, Lisbon, 9th: The Italian air fleet arrived in Lisbon this afternoon, the second-to-last stop on its return trip from America to Italy. Upon arriving in Lisbon, it was escorted by 14 Portuguese aircraft and two destroyers, and thousands of people gathered on the hills, waiting for their arrival, shouting cheers. The first aircraft landed on the river at 2:30 PM (Greenwich time), and by 3:45 PM, all the aircraft had arrived in succession. When General Balbo reviewed the guard of honor, the last three aircraft also arrived, and then flew around the parade ground above the Black Horse Square. All the pilots, in memory of Scagliaglia, who died in a plane crash during takeoff in Horta, may refuse all banquets and entertainment.</p>
<p>▲Havas, Lisbon, 10th: After the Italian Minister of Aviation arrived here, he took a short rest and then summoned reporters in the evening to discuss the flight in detail. Referring to the seaplane that crashed in the Azores, he said that this incident did not detract from the success of the flight. Flying across the Atlantic with 24 aircraft and returning to Lisbon with 23 aircraft, the performance cannot be considered bad. General Balbo also said that Lieutenant Scagliaglia's remains would be transported to Lisbon by an Italian warship. He must wait until the lieutenant's funeral arrangements are completed before he can depart and fly back to Ostia, passing through São Miguel in Portugal, Gibraltar, the Balearic Islands in the Mediterranean Sea, and the Strait of Bonifacio (between Corsica and Sardinia). General Balbo praised the achievements of the French pilots Codos and Rossi, saying that the Italian air fleet members met them in New York. This flight was too risky, and if it were an Italian pilot, he would not have allowed it. When someone asked him about the aviation plan he adopted, Mr. Balbo replied, "In aviation issues, one must have a broad vision and be quick." He also said, "The Azores Islands can be used as an international air traffic station, so there should be facilities for seaplanes to land." However, the convenience of this air traffic should be enjoyed equally by all countries and should not be monopolized by one country. Mr. Balbo meant that the cost of building a seaplane landing base could be negotiated by various countries and shared together. After completion, it should be opened so that all commercial airlines can use it. The main reason for Lieutenant Scagliaglia's accident yesterday was that the Azores Islands did not have seaplane landing facilities. "The Italian air fleet's seaplanes are large and heavy, making it not easy to fly as desired. The Azores Islands should build a port several kilometers long as a base for seaplanes to take off and land," and so on. It is now known that the damage to the front of the crashed seaplane is not significant, and the broken part has been completely repaired.</p>

<p>Short-term Debt Converted into Long-term</p>
<p>Control of Circulation Under Study</p>
<p>▲Kokumin, Washington, 9th: It is currently believed here that rumors that the U.S. government will take action on currency soon are due to the fact that President Roosevelt previously instructed Yale University Professor Rogers and Cornell University Professor Warren to design a plan to convert federal short-term debt into long-term debt, which is about to be completed.</p>
<p>▲Havas, Washington, 9th: The United States wants to establish a policy of controlling currency circulation. Treasury Secretary Woodin is currently studying the necessary conditions before this policy can be established. Mr. Woodin is focusing on economic statistics that indicate rising prices and wants to determine the relationship between rising special prices and the purchasing power of American consumers. President Roosevelt is eager to obtain information on this issue to avoid sudden ups and downs in the economic market that hinder the nation's economic recovery. The prices of raw materials have risen to the level of 1910 to 1914. President Roosevelt is satisfied that the rise in special prices has this result, but the standard of living has not obviously increased. However, the President's hope is not limited to this. He intends to bring the special prices back to the level of the years after the Great War, but he has not mentioned how to achieve this goal.</p>

<p>▲Reuters, Berlin, 9th: Today, the Brunswick government announced that after two days of large-scale arrests, 250 communists have been arrested, including seven women. The reason for this arrest is that it was heard that the communists were plotting to restore the communist party. At the same time, party members were actively engaged in communist propaganda, so the police, in cooperation with members of the National Socialist Party, arrested them. Sixty people have already been sentenced to a total of 45 years of imprisonment, with sentences ranging from one month to six months. Those who have not yet been sentenced may also be punished in the same way.</p>
<p>▲Havas, Berlin, 9th: Today, someone said that university students who worship Marxism and anti-nationalism should be immediately expelled from all universities in Prussia. Each university will have a student organization committee of three people per committee to assist the president in implementing this measure. Another matter that can also lead to expulsion is participation in peace groups. The National Socialist Party regards the peace movement as a kind of treason.</p>

<p>Sever All Relations with the British Crown</p>
<p>Necessary Steps to Declare a Republic</p>
<p>Clash Between Blue Shirts and Authorities Inevitable</p>
<p>▲Reuters, Dublin, 9th: Three motions containing important amendments to the Constitution of the Irish Free State were presented to the Irish Free State Parliament today. One will transfer the functions of the British Crown's representative to the Executive Yuan, one will abolish the British Crown's representative's right to refuse to approve motions, and one will terminate the right to appeal to the Privy Council. If these three motions become law, the result will ultimately be the abolition of the post of Governor-General and the cessation of all contact with the British Crown. If the current organization of Parliament remains unchanged, these motions will inevitably become law within a few months. It is generally felt that this is the first necessary step to declare a republic. It is now expected that Chairman de Valera will order a ban on the Blue Shirts from assembling and marching on Sunday. A clash between the Blue Shirts and the authorities seems inevitable. The severity of the clash will depend on the number of Blue Shirts. According to their leader, General O'Duffy, there may be 30,000 marchers on that day.</p>

<p>▲Reuters, Dublin, 10th: Since entering Parliament in 1927, Southern Ireland's Executive Leader de Valera was hooted for the first time today. After four hours of parliamentary debate on the economic panic and the status of unofficial troops, de Valera intended to stand up and speak, but the sound of "You are destroying the country, you are too weak to deal with any situation" suddenly erupted in the chamber. De Valera was greatly angered and loudly defended himself, but legislators hurled abusive language at each other incessantly. Although the Speaker tried to stop it twice, it was ineffective. The Speaker later declared that if there was any more noise, the meeting would be adjourned immediately, and the chamber was slightly quieter. However, as soon as de Valera made a few remarks, the noise started again. Parliament adjourned at 2:15 PM until September 27th. De Valera was ultimately unable to have the opportunity to explain the government's attitude towards the Blue Shirt march on August 13th.</p>

According to experts, optical broadcasting has now reached a stage of maturity where it can be made public to the world, and all major technical problems have been solved one by one. For example, the Berlin Witzleben broadcasting station can already broadcast scenery daily using short-wave broadcasting machines, and the broadcasted scenery is very clear on days when the weather is clear, with a size of about 12 inches to 16 inches. It is expected that before long, all radio receivers can be equipped with a radio image receiver, so that the receiver can not only hear the sound but also see the situation.</p>

He Long is a native of Sangzhi, and there are still many scattered old troops, making it easy to rally. It is inevitable that he cannot forget this place. From western Hubei to western Hunan, Yuyang Pass is a crucial passage. He Long discovered that there were already heavy troops guarding the area and could not fly over. He also feared attracting the attention of the Hunan Army, so he feigned a retreat to Laifeng to show that he would enter Sichuan Province. However, he suddenly broke out of Yexiong Pass on the 7th and invaded Hunan Province. On the 8th, he concentrated in Longshan, attempting to capture Sangzhi and Yongshun to open up a new base. The bandit drama in western Hubei, which had lasted for seven months, was thus completely swept out of the province. The bandit areas in all counties were thus completely recovered. At the beginning of the suppression, Xu Yuanquan adopted a strategy of encirclement and annihilation, with no intention of harming neighboring areas. After taking office as the Commander-in-Chief of Bandit Suppression in the Hunan-Hubei Border Region, the planning became even stricter. Now that the bandits have fled to Hunan, he has specially dispatched elite troops to track and suppress them. At the same time, he telegraphed the Hunan Army to block them at key points. A part of the Hunan Army under Liu Jianxu was originally ordered to be transferred to Xu's command and had already been stationed at designated locations. He Jian, the Commander-in-Chief of Bandit Suppression in the Western Route, fearing that the strength was still insufficient, increased the dispatch of two brigades to meet the enemy and coordinate with Xu's troops. These newly dispatched two brigades were also requested to be commanded by Xu Yuanquan nearby. It is heard that the actual strength of He's bandits is no more than 3,000 people, and many of the lower-level cadres have disintegrated. It is expected that with the encirclement of the Hunan and Hubei armies, their demise can be expected soon. Xu Yuanquan was supervising the troops on the front line in Changyang a few days ago and returned to Yichang on the 9th. In addition to ordering the troops to continue their efforts to eliminate the remnant bandits, he also paid special attention to the issue of rehabilitation. It is heard that he has decided to convene a rehabilitation conference in Yichang in the near future, inviting county magistrates and local gentry from the counties in the Hunan-Hubei border region to discuss the details of the process. It is found that the counties of Shimen, Cili, Dayong, and Sangzhi in western Hunan, and Hefeng, Wufeng, Laifeng, Xuanen, Enshi, Changyang, and Badong in western Hubei have been ravaged by the bandits for five years. In the last two years, they have been entirely in western Hubei, occupying it three times in total. This time, they have occupied it for more than half a year, and the damage to the local area and the suffering of the people are far beyond what the counties in western Hunan can compare. How to rehabilitate is particularly important. Chairman Chiang has recently telegraphed the Hubei Provincial Government and the Security Department to be responsible for the preparations. The original telegram is as follows: "It is found that the counties of Shihe in western Hubei have been suppressed by Commander-in-Chief Xu leading troops, and bandit nests in various places have been recovered one after another. All matters concerning disaster relief in bandit areas, attracting refugees, organizing Baojia, restoring rural areas, and Qingxiang (cleansing the countryside) should be planned and implemented step by step by the Provincial Government and the Security Department to pacify the area and eliminate bandit troubles."

<h3 id="e88">Bandit Atmosphere in the Border Area of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui Disappears <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>West District Bandit Gang Has Been Defeated</p>
<p>Anqing Communication: Liu Zhenhua, the Commander-in-Chief of Bandit Suppression in the border area of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui, has recently been stationed in Huangchuan to supervise the suppression of bandit gangs. He was also serving as the Chairman of Anhui Province, and the position is temporarily held by the Director of the Department of Civil Affairs, Ma Lingfu. It has been two months since Liu went to Huangchuan. Regarding the true situation of bandit suppression, Liang Haiting, a counselor from the headquarters, arrived in the province from Huangchuan and had some discussions with the provincial government. According to him, the situation of bandit suppression in the border area was very detailed. He briefly said that the border area of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui includes the counties of Shangcheng, Gushi, and Huangchuan in Henan, Macheng and Huangzhou in Hubei, and Luan and Lihuang in Anhui. Each of these counties has long been an area occupied by bandits, and years of suppression have not eliminated them. Chairman Chiang then designated it as a bandit suppression area in the border area, giving Liu the special responsibility for handling it. After Liu arrived in Huangchuan, he arranged the suppression troops in a general way, and then accompanied Liu Maoen of the 11th Route Army and moved to the front line in Xiji. The four divisions of Liang Guanying, Hao Mengling, Peng Zhenshan, and the 64th Division (with Liu Zhenhua concurrently serving as the division commander) were the suppression troops, and the rest of the troops were the blocking troops. The general attack began on the 17th of last month. The 64th Division advanced south from Xiji, Liang Guanying's troops advanced east from Xuanhuadian in Luoshan, and Peng Zhenshan's troops advanced north from Huang'an to Tuanshugang. The pursuit troops engaged in fierce battles with the bandits. As a result, the 64th Division successively occupied Shuangshanmen, Wujiawan, Taipingzhai, Wangjiadawo, and other places, Liang's troops occupied Guojiahe, Guanyinshan, and other places, and Peng's troops occupied Taergang, Jianchanghe, and other places. Since then, the three-way pursuit, each division has completely achieved contact, and the road from Huang'an to Jingfujiugeng is unimpeded. At this moment, the bandits in the west district have been completely defeated. In order to prevent their resurgence, Liu specially ordered the 64th Division and the three divisions of Peng, Liang, etc. to be stationed in various places in the west district for strict search and suppression, and ordered the counties in the special district to organize armed civilians to move to the recovered area and plan to restore the countryside. At the same time, he ordered the troops to advance to the east district, and the military affairs are expected to end soon. Liu also prepared a rehabilitation plan and submitted it to Chairman Chiang for review and implementation. The content is to request an appropriation of 4.9 million yuan, with 1 million yuan for the relief of refugees and the remaining 3.9 million yuan for the needs of rural revival. Chiang has agreed to allocate funds for the relief of refugees in the headquarters. As for the funds for rural revival, it is planned to issue rehabilitation public bonds in the three provinces' border area. This level of handling is more difficult and is still under deliberation. What is currently being carried out is to take in refugees from the bandit area and provide immediate relief. At the same time, the armed immigration policy is used to prepare to organize 20,000 people from the militia in the border area, giving each person a gun, plus three bare-handed people, who will go with them, and 80,000 people can be obtained. They are opened into the bandit area, and those with guns are responsible for defense, and the bare-handed people are incorporated into the newly moved people in the bandit area. Funds are currently being raised and actively carried out. (August 9th)</p>

<p>Defeated Soldiers and Bandits Loot Huiliu Town</p>
<p>Henan Troops Arrive at Zhu Town and Come into Contact with Bandits</p>
<p>Zhengyang Pass Reinforces Defense, Local Area is Peaceful</p>
<p>Bengbu Communication: The defeated soldiers of Yang Yaode's troops in Henan Province, after fleeing into Anhui Province and mixing with the fierce bandits of Zhang Xueliang's gang in Yingzhou, have become increasingly rampant. It is heard that there are indeed more than 2,000 bandits, with 600 to 700 horses. A few days ago, they once approached the city of Fuyang, and the people were panicked. The security team in the city was on high alert, and residents also carried weapons and climbed the city walls to prevent any eventuality. The bandits did not open fire because the city was prepared and the Henan troops were following up and attacking. They only stayed outside the city for one day and night and then detoured around the city and fled to the southeast towards Huiliu Town and Xin Town. They burned, killed, raped, and looted along the way, extremely cruelly. According to the Fuyang Fellow Association in Bengbu, it received a telegram from the county's finance committee on the 8th, saying that the bandits are now occupying Nanzhao Town, and Commander Cheng Ziwang of Henan led three regiments of troops to arrive at Zhu Town and came into contact. The city gate of this county has not been opened and is still on alert. According to news from the Changhuai Water Public Security Bureau, Huiliu Town is located in the southeast of Fuyang, 35 miles from the city, and is on the north bank of the Ying River. It was looted by the bandits, and the local losses were very heavy. There are more than 40 corpses in the Ying River, floating in the water, flowing downstream. It is presumed that the residents were killed by the bandits, and the corpses were thrown into the river. Yunhe Town nearby was also looted by the bandits. Director Jiang Yi led a guerrilla team and set off on a gunboat and arrived at Zhengyang Pass yesterday. According to a long-distance telephone report, the Anhui Provincial Security Team's Ni Lingge Battalion has arrived at Zhengyang Pass to reinforce the defense, and the local area is as peaceful as usual. The Fengtai Security Team has set off upstream to join the troops in suppressing the bandits. Now the bandits have fled to Nanzhao Town. It is found that Nanzhao Town is located between the three counties of Fuyang, Yingshang, and Huoqiu, on the north bank of the Huai River, only separated from Sanhejian by a river. It is the most important town in the upper reaches of the Changhuai River. It was once looted by bandits two years ago, and the local area suffered heavy losses. If it is occupied by bandits now, it is feared that the bandits will have the intention of going down the Huai River to the east. According to reliable information, Director Jiang led the water police on a gunboat from Zhengyang Pass to Liuzikou this morning (9th) at 8 o'clock to prevent the bandits from fleeing east. At the time of the Henan bandits' disturbance, the people in Fuyang have been fleeing to Zhengyang in an endless stream for several days. The long-distance buses between Bengbu and Fuyang have been suspended for several days, but the gasoline boats on the Huai River can still sail to Fuyang, and water traffic is still unimpeded.

<h3 id="e90">Steep Drop in Yellow River Water Level in Shandong Province <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>丨But the Changyuan County, Hebei Province, breached丨</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: The Yellow River in Shandong Province has been in a serious situation since the beginning of the rainy season this year, unlike previous years. Initially, the water level fluctuated, but recently it has only risen without receding. The water level at Luokou in the middle reaches reached 30.36 meters, exceeding last year's highest water level by 2.6 inches. At the same time, all reaches reported tight situations, with dangers looming everywhere. At Linshengtun, Leikou, and other places in the upper reaches, dangerous engineering emerged, and the situation was critical. After receiving the report, the provincial government urgently ordered Zhang Lianjia, the director of the River Affairs Bureau, to go to the dangerous engineering sites in the upper reaches to supervise the defense and repair efforts. He was also ordered to report the water situation in the three reaches three times a day. After receiving the order, Mr. Zhang rushed to the upper reaches at noon on the 5th to supervise everything. After three days, all dangerous works were successively repaired and stabilized. Mr. Zhang went to inspect the Shilipu area yesterday (the 7th). It is reported that today (the 8th) he will go to the junction of Hebei and Shandong provinces to inspect the river water situation. Since the breach in Changyuan County, Hebei Province, the water level in Shandong Province has dropped sharply since yesterday (the 7th). Today (the 8th), heavy rain poured down from about 3:00 AM to about 3:00 PM, but the Yellow River water level still dropped significantly. The water level at Luokou dropped 5.8 inches yesterday, and the water level has dropped from over 33.3 meters to 29.7 meters. The dangerous period may be over. (8th)</p>
<h3 id="e91">Results of the Investigation into the Gold Digging Case in Wuchang <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>Report by the Investigation Committee on the Investigation Process</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: The case of Peng's theft of gold buried in the Kong residence in Wuchang has been under investigation by a committee organized by the garrison headquarters. After a month and eleven meetings, the committee has now concluded its investigation. Peng Younan, the main culprit in the theft, has been released on bail. On the 9th, a report on the investigation process and handling suggestions will be submitted to the garrison headquarters. This case will soon be finalized. The original report is divided into four parts: ㈠ The process of continuing the investigation. In addition to reporting the situation of each meeting in a timely manner, Zheng Rongtai, the owner of the cement project at the Peng residence, and Zheng Chouya, the shop owner, were summoned to the meeting. Their statements were consistent with those of the worker Tao Shaolian (Tao's statement has been reported earlier). Subsequently, both parties involved were summoned to supplement the facts. Peng Younan was placed under the guarantee of a reliable shop, and Kong Wenxuan was requested to hand over 385 silver ingots and 72 pieces of loose silver of various sizes for safekeeping, as originally agreed. Zheng Rongtai was still ordered to quickly hand over the fugitive excavator Li Changhe for thorough investigation. ㈡ Determination of the case. The site of the buried gold was confirmed to be within Kong Wenxuan's land after on-site inspection. According to Li Changhe and Tao Shaolian, the discovery was made when Li was excavating the Peng family's foundation wall adjacent to the Kong family's wall. Li was a worker for the Peng family and had no reason to excavate the Kong family's wall. Peng Younan's continued excavation had even less legal basis. Moreover, after the discovery, Peng drove away all irrelevant personnel and continued to excavate, which is even more suspected of theft. As for the stolen goods and their quantity, it is difficult to investigate. However, the area of the gold-filled site has been measured, and the volume of the second discovery can also be compared. Furthermore, Li testified that there were yellow strips and large "Ta Ta" (a unit of weight) in the site, which indicates that it was not purely small silver. ㈢ Opinions on Peng Younan's defense statement. 1. Peng stated that the location of the buried gold was not within Kong Wenxuan's land. However, the Kong and Peng walls are close together, making it impossible to hide so much gold. The gold-filled site is indeed in the Kong residence, and the silver excavated for the second time was also in a corner of the site, which was witnessed by everyone. 2. Peng stated that the wall was collapsing and not excavated by him, which is refuted by the testimonies of Li and Tao. 3. Peng stated that Li's testimony did not mention gold, but Li mentioned yellow strips, etc. Although it cannot be concluded that the yellow strips were gold, who can say for sure that they were not gold? ㈣ The opinions of all committee members on the handling of this case. Based on the above points, Peng Younan is considered to be highly suspicious. Now that he has been released on bail, other measures should not be considered. However, whether the excavated material is pure silver or mixed with gold, and what the quantity is, in addition to strictly urging the guarantor Zheng Rongtai to hand over Li Changhe for interrogation, it is requested that a person skilled in surveying and calculation be hired to compare the area of the original gold-filled site with the number of silver ingots discovered the second time, and their volume. If it is assumed that the entire gold-filled site is silver, an accurate calculation should be made, so as to strictly pursue the confiscation of the entire amount for local public welfare undertakings. Kong Wenxuan should also be ordered to hand over the silver discovered the second time in its entirety, so as to fulfill his high-mindedness of disregarding money. (9th)</p>
<h3 id="e92">Smuggling Case at Jiaozhou Customs <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>Forged Documents Used to Extract 1,500 Bags of White Sugar</p>
<p>Two Customs Officers Fled After the Incident</p>
<p>Qingdao Correspondence: Jiaozhou Customs has close cooperative relationship with the Port Authority of this city, and its procedures are strict. Therefore, cases of tax evasion and smuggling are rare. Unexpectedly, a major smuggling case was recently discovered where customs officers colluded with a customs broker to forge documents and illegally extract 1,500 bags of white sugar. After this case occurred, the parties involved were reluctant to announce the facts, so the truth could not be ascertained. It is said that two customs officers on duty that day fled after the incident. The evaded customs duties on the 1,500 bags of white sugar are worth about 9,000 yuan, which is a significant loss for the customs. The discovery of the tax evasion occurred roughly as follows:</p>
<p>On July 25th, when the calculation section of the Port Authority was sorting out the cargo request forms for the 17th of this month, it was suddenly discovered that there were two forms, numbers 575 and 576, requesting a total of 1,500 bags of white sugar. The numbers were repeated, and after checking the customs-stamped delivery slips, there were no items of white sugar extraction. After a detailed investigation, it was discovered that the customs broker had forged the name stamp of Li Xingyan, an employee of the calculation section, and bypassed the calculation section that checks the customs delivery slips. They calculated the wharfage fees themselves, paid the full amount at the collection office, and transported the white sugar out of the customs at about 5:00 PM that afternoon in 125 large carts. After the incident was discovered, in addition to strictly investigating whether any employees of the bureau were involved in the smuggling, the situation was reported to the customs for strict investigation. It has now been found that two customs officers on duty at 6:00 PM that afternoon went to work at 5:00 PM and used clever words to dismiss the previous shift's customs officers. They then secretly released the goods at this time. It is now reported that the customs officers have fled, so the customs is waiting to notify the Public Security Bureau to investigate the people involved in this case. If it is found in the future that employees of the bureau are involved in the smuggling, they will be punished according to the law. (August 7th)</p>
<h3 id="e93">Rampant Bandits in Jiaodong <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>Jiaosha Bus Robbed</p>
<p>Jiaoxian United Association Surrounded</p>
<p>Qingdao Correspondence: The counties in Jiaodong have been ravaged by bandits for years, and the suffering is unspeakable. Fortunately, each county has established a United Village Association, which owns firearms and hires strong men, who are trained during slack farming seasons to provide protection. The bandits have been slightly restrained. Since last year, when Han Fuqu, the chairman of Shandong Provincial Government, ordered the dissolution of all United Village Associations in the counties, the people have no armed forces, and bandits in various places have taken the opportunity to emerge. Kidnappings are heard every day. Now that the green gauze tents of summer have risen, the bandit forces are even more rampant, daring to openly confront the government army and even intercept Jiaosha buses, kidnapping no less than a hundred people, which is truly shocking. The recent bandit situation in Jiaodong is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>(Jiaosha Bus Robbed) At Beidu, where Jiaoxian and Pingdu are adjacent, the terrain is low-lying and covers more than ten acres. It is an area where bandits often appear. This summer, a large group of bandits, numbering about a hundred, with more than eighty Mauser pistols, wearing various colored clothes, and speaking local accents, has been discovered there. They are entrenched there and plundering in all directions. At the end of last month, two Jiaosha buses from Shahe to Jiaoxian were intercepted and surrounded by bandits near the area. They fired their guns as a warning and kidnapped more than thirty passengers. They also forced the two bus drivers to drive the buses to transport goods. After arriving at their destination, they interrogated the hostages one by one, asking about their family property, in order to bargain for ransom. According to those who escaped, the bandits have kidnapped no less than a hundred people before and after. Moreover, since robbing the buses, they have been using the buses to kidnap people. A few days ago, they kidnapped the father of the town chief of Longxing Town and three neighbors.</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>The bus drivers are said to have escaped in the meantime and reported the case to the Jiaoxian County Government. Upon receiving the report, County Magistrate Zhou Lisheng considered the case to be serious and went to the headquarters of the 86th Brigade stationed in Jiaozhou to consult with Brigade Commander Chen Dejian. Brigade Commander Chen immediately dispatched troops to join forces with the militia and the Public Security Bureau to encircle and suppress the bandits. Upon hearing the news, the bandits fled into Pingdu. The troops are currently still tracking them.</p>
<p>(Openly Confronting the Government Army) The bandits at the junction of Pingdu and Jiaozhou have not yet been suppressed, and another group of bandits, numbering about eighty, with fifty or sixty guns, has been discovered in the Qiaoge Zhuang and Zhang Zhuang areas at the junction of Jiaozhou. Upon receiving the report, Gong Zhipu, the head of the third district of Jiaoxian County, reported the case to the county government and requested that troops be dispatched to suppress the bandits. At the same time, he joined forces with the United Village Association of the district to encircle the bandits. On the 2nd of this month, they came into contact with the bandits and engaged in a fierce battle for several hours. Due to being outnumbered, seven members of the association were killed by the bandits. County Magistrate Zhou Lisheng has now accompanied Regiment Commander Zhang of the 86th Brigade, leading a battalion of infantry and several mortars, and is heading to the scene of the incident in armored vehicles to suppress the bandits. They disembarked at Lancun Railway Station and transferred to the scene of the incident to pursue the bandits. It is now reported that the bandits are entrenched in the Zhang Zhuang and Jiajia Lou areas, and sentries have been set up outside the villages, openly confronting the government army. The troops led by County Magistrate Zhou and others arrived in Xiaobu yesterday, only a few miles away from the bandits. They are now seeking an opportunity to advance and suppress the bandits.

<h3 id="e94">Resolution of the Bingtian (Soldier's Land) Case of Tonghai Kenmu (Reclamation and Animal Husbandry) Company <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>(The Executive Yuan Resolved to Waive Compensation)</p>
<p>Tonghai Kenmu Company was founded by Mr. Zhang Jian. Mr. Zhang worked hard, fighting against the tides for thirty years, finally transforming barren saline land into fertile soil and providing a livelihood for tens of thousands of people. When the company was established, the Su and Lang camps had 400 qing of bingtian. In the fourth year of Daoguang of the Former Qing Dynasty, it was decided that Zhang Nanting and Lu Yuhe would permanently lease the land, exert their efforts to enclose and reclaim it. By the twenty-seventh year of Guangxu, after eighty or ninety years, only 160 qing had been reclaimed. The Su camp had only collected rent on 99 qing and some odd acres, and the Lang camp had only collected rent on 61 qing and some odd acres. The remaining 239 qing and some odd acres were all low-lying mud flats that were most difficult to enclose. Only a portion was enclosed by the Zhang and Lu family tenants, which cost a lot of labor. However, the two hurricane tides in the twenty-eighth and thirty-first years of Guangxu washed away the dikes that had been built, as if they had not been enclosed. The seawater was extremely salty. Once it flooded in, even the reclaimed land would immediately turn into saline soil. The tenants were unable to repair it and were willing to include the two washed-down embankments and the unreclaimed mud flats into the company's management. The company would return more than 73,000 yuan in silver to the tenants as compensation for the tenant rights and labor costs. The unreclaimed wasteland was subscribed for shares by converting the silver taels paid by the two towns into standard taels for shares, with each share being 100 standard taels of silver. The Su camp was converted into 44 shares and the Lang camp into 8 shares. At that time, the two towns sent personnel to conduct on-site surveys, and the land was priced for shares. It was reported to the Former Qing Governor of Jiang and approved. After the founding of the Republic of China, the company also registered the land and paid taxes in accordance with regulations. It was also ordered by the Jiangxu Military Governor to transfer the shares of the two camps to the Qingjiang Congee Factory and the Poor People's Factory. The company was instructed to change the names of the account holders. In the seventeenth year of the Republic of China, the Ministry of Finance of the National Government issued a license to ensure credibility. However, some people coveted the high price of the land and concealed the hardships of the initial undertaking. They fabricated facts and initially filed a complaint with the Ministry of Finance, which was not approved. They then accused the company of bribing officials and insulting revolutionary officials, as seen in official documents. At the same time, they reported to the Ministry of Military Affairs that the company was encroaching on military property. After investigating and finding that it was untrue, the Ministry formulated five measures and presented them to the Executive Yuan, ordering the company to pay compensation for the land at the current price. The company believed that this was a private rights dispute and should be under the jurisdiction of the judiciary. It presented the case to the Supreme Court, which decided in August of the twentieth year that the case should be adjudicated by the Haimen County Government in accordance with the law. The Haimen County Government then ruled that the bingtian in question belonged to the company. Even according to the measures formulated by the Ministry of Military Affairs, the fifth item stated that the subscription of shares with the price paid by the two camps was not comparable to encroachment. The Executive Yuan instructed the Ministry of Military Affairs that the ownership of the bingtian reclaimed by the Tonghai Kenmu Company was not denied. The company's ownership of the bingtian was confirmed, and the former Qing and Republic of China governments all recognized it as correct. However, the original plaintiff accused the company of bribing its way through the process and defaming the dignity of the judiciary, as seen in official documents. It was found that the Su and Lang camps still had 160 qing and some odd acres. In the sixth year of the Republic of China, the General Bureau of Official Land in Taiwan estimated the value of the land and transferred it to the people at a price of 1.5 yuan per mu. In the seventeenth year, the Ministry of Military Affairs ordered these transferees to register in accordance with regulations and pay a handling fee of 3 cents per mu, without ordering them to pay the price again. However, the bingtian subscribed for shares was originally barren land. The combined value of the shares and the cost of recovering the tenant rights was more than 3 yuan per mu. Therefore, the company was not suspected of taking advantage of low prices. The company's entire reclaimed land, in addition to being used for public welfare funds, was completely distributed to the shareholders in the fourth and fourteenth years of the Republic of China. Since then, it has been sold and resold, and the ownership has changed hands many times. A small number of shareholders entrusted the company to manage the land on their behalf. The company was only responsible for partial agency responsibilities and had no right to control it under the law. Therefore, based on legal principles, the company had no reason to pay compensation, and it was impossible to pay compensation in fact. However, the original plaintiff still refused to give up the lawsuit. The case was suspended for four years, resulting in a stalemate. If the government were to enforce the compensation, the company would be on the verge of collapse, and the complete rural community would be destroyed. Mr. Zhang Xiaoruo has not been involved in the company's affairs in recent years due to the compilation of his ancestor Mr. Zhang Jian's biography. Seeing that the company was facing false accusations and was in danger of being destroyed, and that the company was the business painstakingly operated by his ancestor, and that the outcome of the case was related to his ancestor's lifelong reputation and the credibility of the entire Nantong business, he had to personally take charge. Based on the above legal principles and facts, he requested the Executive Yuan to withdraw the order for compensation. He also requested the Ministries of Military Affairs and Industry to give preferential consideration and forward the request to the Executive Yuan to withdraw the order for compensation in accordance with the law and the situation. Therefore, the Ministry of Industry's report to the Executive Yuan and the communication to the Ministry of Military Affairs cited Articles 91 and 92, Paragraph 2 of the current Company Law, stating that the case was far back in the Former Qing Dynasty, and the procedures for handling shares with property as capital were not exactly the same. However, the case was approved by the Former Qing Governor of Jiang and a license was issued by the Ministry of Finance of the National Government. Therefore, by comparing it with the current laws and regulations, it could be regarded as having gone through legal procedures and should be considered appropriate. No further compensation should be paid. The Ministry of Military Affairs also stated in its final reply to the Executive Yuan that it respectfully requested the Executive Yuan to review and instruct how to handle the case. After receiving the reports from the two ministries and the company, the Executive Yuan ordered the Ministries of Military Affairs and Industry to jointly review the case. During the review, Deng, a counselor of the Yuan, attended the meeting. Chen, the acting minister of the Ministry of Military Affairs, and Duanmu, the director of the department, attended the meeting. Pi, the section chief of the Ministry of Industry, attended the meeting. The representative of the Ministry of Military Affairs stated that there were no prejudices. The conclusion was then signed and submitted to the President of the Yuan and submitted to the 119th meeting of the Executive Yuan on August 8, which decided to waive the compensation. President Wang and others, in the spirit of democratic governance, believed that if the statutory property rights that had been established for a long time were not protected, the property rights of all citizens would be fundamentally shaken, and the social organization would be destroyed. It was not just a matter of the collapse of a rural community, so they had to protect it and withdraw the order for compensation. The long-pending bingtian case of the Kenmu Company was finally resolved.</p>
<h3 id="e95">Three Ships of the Bohai Fleet Incorporated into the Guangdong Sea Fleet <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>Directly Under the Command of the First Army Group Headquarters</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: After the three ships of the Bohai Fleet, Haiqi, Haichen, and Zhahe, were transferred to Guangdong, they were incorporated by the Southwest and handed over to the commander-in-chief of the First Army Group for proper organization. Chen Jitang initially planned to subordinate the three ships to the original Japanese Naval Headquarters. In the end, considering that the three ships were coastal defense ships and should not be under the same department as the Jiangfang (river defense) fleet of Guangdong Province, the three ships were incorporated into the Guangdong Sea Fleet. They would be under the command of the commander-in-chief of the First Army Group and not subject to the naval headquarters under the original Japanese Headquarters. After several consultations, it was decided to designate the three ships Haiqi, etc., as the "Guangdong Sea Fleet of the First Army Group of the National Revolutionary Army." Jiang Xiyuan was appointed as the Major General Commander of the Guangdong Sea Fleet in the name of the commander-in-chief of the First Army Group. Ran Hongpian was appointed as the Captain of the Haiqi ship with the rank of Colonel, Tang Jing as the Deputy Captain with the rank of Lieutenant Colonel, Guan Jizhou as the Captain of the Haichen ship with the rank of Colonel, Zhang Fengren as the Deputy Captain with the rank of Lieutenant Colonel, Yang Chaolun as the Captain of the Zhahe ship with the rank of Colonel, Li Baolin as the Deputy Captain with the rank of Lieutenant Colonel, and Zhao Zonghan as the Colonel Chief Instructor of the Guangdong Sea Fleet. The appointment letters for the above officers were brought back to Huangpu by Guan Jizhou, the Captain of the Haichen ship, at 8:00 AM on July 30 and announced to all officers and soldiers on the ship. It is reported that all officers and soldiers of the three ships will not be changed, only the Captains and Deputy Captains will be newly appointed. As for the headquarters of the Guangdong Sea Fleet, its organization is not much different from that of an ordinary fleet headquarters. In addition to the Chief of Staff, there are eight departments under the Commander: Military Supply, Ordnance, Military Medicine, Military Balance, Staff, Adjutant, Secretary, and Engineering. The position of Chief of Staff of the Guangdong Sea Fleet Headquarters has been appointed to Lu Tongyang. Mr. Lu is currently ill and has not yet reported for duty and the position is temporarily held concurrently by the Chief Instructor Zhao Zonghan. The candidates for the heads of each department have also been decided by Jiang Xiyuan, the Commander of the Guangdong Sea Fleet, and submitted to the Commander-in-Chief of the First Army Group for review and approval. Once approved, they will take office separately. The Guangdong Sea Fleet Headquarters is expected to be established this month. The headquarters will be located in Guangzhou, and the three ships will still be docked in Huangpu to consolidate the coastal defense. The total expenses have been greatly reduced and are expected to be over 90,000 yuan per month. (August 1st)</p>

<p>Yesterday, a floating corpse drifted into the Caochangbang area in the Upper Fourth District of the West Outer of this county. It was stranded on the beach. The local villagers spotted it and reported to the local police Zhou Wentao. They went to inspect the face of the corpse, but no one recognized it, so there was no way to find out its name or where it came from. They then reported to the county court. At 1:00 PM, Prosecutor Zhu returned to the countryside with the forensic officer Wang and police officers to examine the corpse. It was found that the deceased was about thirty years old, wearing a white short shirt, naked from the waist down, and the face was gradually decaying and difficult to identify. It was confirmed that he had drowned in the river. The local police were ordered to prepare a coffin and wait for an announcement for the family to claim the body.</p>

<p>Zhu Songting and Ji Hengfu, two villagers near Tangqiankou, are farmers and have a comfortable family life, so they have recently been targeted by bandits. At about 12:00 AM on the 8th, a boat carrying sixteen bandits, all speaking the Jiangbei dialect, suddenly docked near the area. Soon after, they went directly to the homes of Zhu and Ji to rob them, overturning boxes and cabinets and stealing a lot of clothes and jewelry, which were all wrapped in mosquito nets and bundles. Before leaving, they kidnapped Zhu Songting and Ji Hengfu's wife and three daughters. The families have reported to the Huangjing Public Security Branch to request strict investigation.</p>

<p>The case of You Bolu, the chief of the fifth district of Zhabei Public Security Bureau, shooting and killing a civilian, was appealed to the Supreme Court after the First Instance judgment of the Jiangsu High Court, which sentenced him to three years of imprisonment. The Supreme Court believed that the judgment was unclear regarding the shooting issue and sent it back to the High Court for retrial. Yesterday (the 10th) at 10:00 AM, Judge Si Wen of the Criminal Division opened the court. Police officer Lin Qingxiang and four others were present, and witnesses Shi Tifen and Zhao Ying were summoned to testify.

<h3 id="e100">Wuxi Silk Industry Requests Reduction of Freight Rates for Factory Silk <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>Wuxi is the richest silk-producing area in Jiangsu Province. In the most prosperous period of production, it produced more than 40,000 pieces per year. Recently, the silk market has been bleak, and production has also decreased. Previously, when exporting silk, it was always transported by train, and railway freight was also a large source of income. In recent years, freight transport between Wuxi and Shanghai has been fiercely competitive, and many factory silks have been switched to boat transport. Recently, the Railway Bureau is reducing prices to develop freight transport. Twenty or more factories, including Yongtai Dingchang Qiansheng, have jointly written to the Two-Route Administration and the Jinghu Route Traffic Department, requesting a reduction in freight rates for factory silk, in order to ensure that it is still transported by train. The reasons they cited are as follows: ㈠ The silk industry has been failing for years, and the government is trying to provide relief. The freight should still be charged at 2.7 yuan per piece, as before. ㈡ When silk prices were at their highest, each dan (a unit of weight) cost 1,700 or even 2,000 taels. Now that the tael has been abolished and replaced by the yuan, each dan has dropped to 700 or 800 yuan, and freight rates should be reduced accordingly. ㈢ Water transport between Shanghai and Wuxi is very convenient. Freight boats compete to reduce freight rates in order to attract customers, and they also offer various conveniences to shippers, such as deadlines for delivery. The Railway Bureau has sent personnel to investigate the silk transport volume over the years and the current situation in order to submit the findings to the traffic meeting for joint discussion.</p>

<p>Jiang Hanchen, the wanted criminal in the case of kidnapping Han Jiaotai, the chief of Xiexian Township in the third district, was apprehended in Beijing by his paternal uncle Lan Tang and handed over to the Provincial Police Department. Wuxi County Government dispatched Wu Rongsheng, a political police officer, to Beijing to escort him back. He arrived in Wuxi at 6:00 PM on the 9th and was handed over to the county government. That night, Yao Fusheng, the director of the review department of the county government, interrogated him and summoned Zhou Zhihe and Yang Abao, who were in custody, to the court for separate interrogation and then joint confrontation. The interrogation lasted for three hours. Jiang admitted that he and Chen Dabao, who had been released by the Shanghai Special Court, were responsible for guarding the hostages. After the interrogation, Jiang Hanchen was ordered to be imprisoned. His paternal uncle, Jiang Lantang, was also detained on suspicion of another case. The suspect Jiang is 19 years old and studied at a secondary school. Due to associating with bandits, he joined the bandit gang.</p>
<h3 id="e102">Resolution of the Rickshaw Fare Issue <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>The strike of rickshaw pullers in this county, after careful handling by the county government, ended with a full resumption of work on the 8th. The evening before, the Rickshaw Trade Association held its sixth preparatory meeting, following orders to prepare for re-election. The current preparatory committee members submitted a collective resignation to the County Party Headquarters, and it was resolved to send Yao Ganshi to the county government to discuss the rickshaw fare issue. At the same time, a report on the re-election process of the association will be submitted to the County Party Headquarters, the County Government, and the County Chamber of Commerce for record. Yesterday (the 10th), at around 9:00 AM, the county government invited representatives from the Party, government, commerce, and relevant parties to the county for discussions. Those present included County Magistrate Yan Shenyu, Xu Yongji from the County Party Headquarters, Qian Sunqing from the County Chamber of Commerce, Chen Zhandong from the County Property Department, Zhang Fulun from the Technical Office, Ji Zhongliang from the First District Office (representing Qian Xie Zeng), Yao Ganshi and Ren Shuying representing the Rickshaw Trade Association, and Shen Zaichuan and Yi Jingting representing the Yancheng Association, totaling ten people. First, County Magistrate Yan delivered a speech outlining the purpose of inviting the representatives to the government for discussions. Next, Yao Ganshi, representing the Rickshaw Trade Association, spoke about the difficulties faced by the rickshaw industry. He stated that the cost per rickshaw was eleven yuan per month. The previously set fare of 3.7 cents could still cover costs, but it was not implemented due to inconsistent rickshaw prices among businesses. This time, the restoration of the fixed price led to the rickshaw pullers' strike, resulting in significant losses and damaged rickshaws. He requested that the government severely punish the instigators who had been arrested. Then, Shen Zaichuan, representing the rickshaw pullers, stood up and spoke about the difficulties faced by the rickshaw pullers in making a living. He requested that the investors show understanding and reduce the rickshaw fare to maintain their livelihood. He also requested that the maximum rickshaw fare be set at 850 copper coins per rickshaw, and asked the government to leniently punish the rickshaw pullers. Finally, Qian Sunqing, representing the County Chamber of Commerce, expressed his views. Regarding the disputes between the rickshaw industry and the rickshaw pullers, he stated that the rickshaw industry should not stubbornly adhere to its views, and the rickshaw pullers should not be overly insistent. He pointed out that the rickshaws in Wuxi were inferior to those in other counties, with only 70% still usable, and the remaining 30% being dilapidated and difficult to pull. He requested that the authorities take action to address this. He stated that he was in a mediating position, and according to the cause of the case, which was due to administrative actions, he hoped that both sides would respect the county magistrate's intentions and persuade the industry to resolve the issue. The county magistrate did not favor either side and handled the matter impartially. After three hours of discussion, County Magistrate Yan summarized the opinions of all parties and decided on two points regarding the rickshaw fare standard: (1) For rickshaws in good condition, the maximum rental price would be 1,000 copper coins per day per rickshaw. (2) For dilapidated rickshaws, the minimum standard would be 850 copper coins. It was decided that the county government would issue a public notice on the 16th of this month for everyone to comply with. As for the dilapidated rickshaws, the Technical Office would immediately dispatch personnel to inspect each rickshaw company, and those that were too dilapidated would be banned, while those in good condition would be marked for rectification. The meeting adjourned at half-past noon.</p>

<p>Chen Jinpei, a villager from Fangqian Village near Tangqiao Town in the Fifth District of Wuyi County, had been rumored for days to have been murdered and his body destroyed to cover up the crime. The nearby Sixth Public Security Bureau and the County Court Procuratorate both sent personnel to investigate. On the 9th, the deceased's mother-in-law, Zhang Chen, and night watchman Wang Liansheng testified at the County Court, providing details about the murder. Subsequently, the County Court received a phone report from the Sixth Public Security Bureau stating that a body, hacked into multiple pieces, had suddenly surfaced in the Xinqiaotou River. Chief Prosecutor Yang Kong dispatched officials to Henglin by car, then hired a boat to proceed. Upon arriving at the crab weir near Xinqiaotou, they saw a foot floating and, after retrieving it, took it to a nearby corpse field. They found that the body had been hacked into nine pieces: one head, two hands, one foot, one lower abdomen, two thighs, and two buttocks. The body was not completely pieced together, missing parts such as the thighs. Everyone who witnessed this tragic scene was deeply saddened. Chief Prosecutor Yang also ordered the forensic officer to examine the deceased's head and found injuries from wooden objects and knife wounds on the back of the head. The corpse's relatives identified it as Chen Jinpei's body without a doubt. The Chief Prosecutor immediately ordered a thorough investigation and instructed the corpse's relatives to prepare a coffin for burial.

<p>A man surnamed Jin, a resident of Majia Lane in this port city, works in a certain agency. His son, Jin Wanhua, is 19 years old and studies at a certain school, not yet graduated. He is quite reserved and academically successful. Gao Yue'e, a 17-year-old girl from Jiangdu, who lives with relatives, is in the same class as Jin. Over time, they fell in love, and during their free time, they would often stroll together hand in hand. By the summer vacation, their passion had reached its peak, and they made a promise to be together forever. The girl had already obtained her family's consent, but Jin's father disapproved, hindering their relationship. The day before yesterday, Jin and the girl took a rickshaw to the Xiche Wharf. As it was still early before departure, they sat opposite each other in a small teahouse, chatting intimately. Before long, it was time, so they bought tickets and boarded the ship, transferring to Yangzhou. They stayed overnight. Yesterday morning, they took the first ship back to Zhenjiang. After boarding at Liuwei, they went to the cabin, still talking and laughing as usual. Unexpectedly, as soon as the ship started, they went out hand in hand to stroll around. When they reached the railing of the cabin in the middle of the journey, they embraced each other and jumped into the river. The ship stopped to search, but there was no trace of them. Only Jin's straw hat was hooked with a bamboo pole. When the ship arrived at the Zhenjiang port, the news spread throughout the city.</p>

<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Government, in order to investigate the local budgets of various counties for the 22nd year, had already organized a Local Budget Committee to review them in advance according to the resolutions of the Provincial Committee. Due to the large number of documents and the need for detailed calculations, the review has not yet been completed. The current fiscal year has already begun, and all local undertakings in various counties cannot be suspended due to the undetermined expenses. Therefore, the Provincial Government Committee decided that the Review Committee should be urged to expedite the review. Before the review is completed, the counties are temporarily allowed to spend at 80% of the amount listed in the original draft budgets they submitted. Except for cases that have not been approved, the levies to be collected should still be collected according to the established cases. After the budget is finalized, it will be handled according to the budget. The Provincial Government has already ordered the counties to comply with this.</p>
<h3 id="e106">Investigation of the Case of the Jiangyin Provincial Committee's Complaint Against the Party Committee <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>Chen Xiping, a standing committee member of the County Party Headquarters Executive Committee, and Huang Bingying, an alternate member and general affairs officer, mutually accused each other of fraud and perjury. The Wuxi Court held a trial on the 31st of last month. Huang Bingying suddenly went to the Party Headquarters to retrieve a mirror frame for oaths and compared the seals with Chen Xiping. Chen Xiping called County Magistrate Ruan via long-distance telephone in Wuxi and had Huang arrested and detained. Huang refused to accept the detention and filed an appeal. He also presented a statement to the Provincial Party Headquarters, requesting relief. Yesterday (the 7th), the Provincial Party Headquarters sent Xiong Yufang (from Guizhou), an officer from the Civil Training Department, to Cheng to investigate. In the afternoon, he went to the County Party Headquarters and summoned Shen Qinru, a staff member who witnessed Huang Bingying entering to retrieve the mirror frame on the evening of the 30th, as well as the servant Qian Laosi and the guard Yan Bingrong, to inquire about the situation at the time. The Provincial Committee suspected Huang of taking more than 80 case files, as it was unlikely that so many cases could have been accumulated in one week. If the completed case files were to be archived, Committee Member Chen Lan should be responsible for checking them and determining which case files were missing. The reporter went to the Provincial Committee's residence at the Jiangyin Hotel and asked for his opinion after the investigation. Xiong stated that he was unwilling to say much before reporting back to the Provincial Executive Committee. He added that Huang Bingying's procedure for retrieving the mirror frame for oaths as an alternate member was indeed illegal. From the Party's standpoint, he should be subject to Party discipline, but the matter was suddenly handed over to the judiciary without reporting to the Provincial Government, which was somewhat inappropriate. It is reported that the Provincial Committee will stay in Cheng for one day and then return to the province to report.</p>

In the 16th year of the Republic, she served as a secretary of the Provincial Party Provisional Executive Committee and later joined the Health Department as a staff member. Zhang was known for her social skills and had many male friends. Her husband, Shen Kuang, from Xiaoshan, is currently working at the Statistics Council of the Ministry of Railways in Nanjing. Zhang and her seven-year-old son lived together at No. 7 Guangfu Road. On the morning of the 9th, she requested leave from the Municipal Government to go home because she was feeling unwell and went to bed. She did not wake up by the evening, and the maid went to call her, finding Zhang's face pale and barely alive. A whole bottle of sleeping pills was left on the bedside. Knowing that she had taken poison, the woman living with her, surnamed Zhu, immediately called a doctor for emergency treatment. At around 8:00 PM, she hired a car to take her to the Municipal Hospital for treatment, where she was given more than 20 injections of stimulants.

<p>▲Letter Correcting</p>
<p>To the Editor:</p>
<p>I am writing to correct a news item published in your newspaper on the 5th of this month regarding the incident of salt police assaulting people in Lujiahui, Nanhui, leading to a market strike. The facts described are not in accordance with the truth. On July 29th, the tax police stationed in Lujiahui seized more than 200 catties of contraband salt at a tailor shop in the town. Xu Yiqun (also known as Xu Fuzhao), who is known for protecting smugglers, gathered a crowd to obstruct the seizure and incite opposition to the sale of government salt. They then destroyed the government salt distribution office in the town, assaulting the shop clerks, and instigated the local security corps to chase and fire at the tax police. At the same time, they incited merchants and residents to strike in order to drive away the tax police and abolish the government salt depot. Fortunately, the officers and soldiers of the tax police exercised restraint and avoided a major incident. Subsequently, Jin, the director of the Nanhui County Public Security Bureau, Wang, the inspector, and Zuo, the patrol officer of Hangtou, together with Chen, the district director of the First District of our bureau, persuaded the merchants and residents not to be fooled. By the evening of the 30th, order had been restored. Unexpectedly, Xu Yiqun fabricated facts and falsely accused the tax police, confusing the public. The incident is related to the reputation of the tax police of our bureau. In addition to clarifying the facts and reporting them, we have specially written this letter to correct the situation and request that it be published in the letters column to clarify the truth.</p>

The arrangement inside the hall was cautionary, and the atmosphere of the meeting place was solemn. The ceremony concluded at around 12:00 PM. Details are described below.</p>

<p>Starting at 8:00 AM yesterday, the Security Department deployed guards on Longhua Road. Inside the Garrison Headquarters, the Garrison troops were on special alert. Above the main gate, on both the east and west sides, hung horizontal banners that read "Inauguration Ceremony of the January 28th Memorial Hall." A large, colorful archway commemorating "January 28th" was erected at the entrance, with large crossed Party and national flags on both sides. Various cautionary slogans were posted along Longhua Road and inside the Garrison Headquarters. Four reception rooms were set up in the Garrison Headquarters office, where staff members of the headquarters served refreshments to the guests in a very thoughtful manner.</p>
<h3 id="e120">Arrangement of the Auditorium <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>The January 28th Memorial Hall was arranged very exquisitely. In the center hung the Party and national flags and the portrait and last will of Sun Yat-sen. Small Party and national flags were hung on all four sides of the hall. On both sides of the front were hung portraits of Chairman Lin of the National Government, President Wang, Chairman Jiang, and Minister He. On the four walls were hung portraits of anti-Japanese generals Chen Mingshu, Jiang Guangnai, Cai Tingkai, Dai Ji, Zhang Zhizhong, and senior officers of the 19th Route Army and the 5th Army, as well as portraits of fallen soldiers. Seven large and small oil paintings depicting anti-Japanese warfare were hung on the pillars on both sides of the hall, which were startling. There were also various statistical charts on participating in the anti-Japanese resistance, as well as framed couplets sent by various circles, which were also hung on the walls. What was most noteworthy was that the seating arrangement for the guests was in the shape of "128". Famous oil paintings, such as the 19th Route Army holding a military conference and the Japanese army attacking Wusong by sea and air, were displayed. Among them, one of the most startling paintings was the street battle in front of the Commercial Press on Baoshan Road in Zhabei. At a glance, one could immediately recall the old scenes of the January 28th battle last year, lingering in one's mind and unable to be erased.</p>
<h3 id="e121">Participating Guests <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>

<h3 id="e123">Chairman's Report <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>After the ceremony was conducted as prescribed, Garrison Commander Dai Ji, as chairman, reported: "Ladies and gentlemen, representatives from all circles, today is the day of the inauguration of the January 28th Memorial Hall of our headquarters. We are truly honored that you have come from afar to participate, despite the summer heat. However, preparations were too rushed, and there are too many imperfections. We hope you will point them out. The hospitality is also inadequate, and we hope you will forgive us. I will now report to you on the process of preparing this hall. The January 28th Incident is a day worth commemorating, and I believe that most of you share this sentiment, especially the people of Shanghai, who suffered deeply and should never forget it. After the January 28th battle, I wanted to create something to mark this everlasting commemoration, to prevent the people of Shanghai from forgetting this trauma, and to stimulate the people of Shanghai not to let their enthusiasm for revenge and wiping out the humiliation cool down. However, due to limited funds, the matter did not come to fruition. Later, when I saw Zhabei preparing to build a Tomb of Unknown Heroes, I felt even more that the Nanshi area should also have a building with the same purpose. It just so happened that the auditorium of our headquarters had been in disrepair for many years and was about to collapse. After the central government sent people to investigate, they allocated several thousand yuan for reconstruction. I took this opportunity to take advantage of this small amount of money to transform the auditorium and name it the January 28th Memorial Hall to serve as a permanent memorial to the January 28th Shanghai battle. Although it was built with limited resources, it was significant that the memorial hall was located in Longhua, where I had made decisions with Mr. Jiang and Mr. Cai before the war. So I opened up a barren land to the west of the hall, built a pavilion and planted trees, and erected a monument on the small hill as a record. The pavilion and garden are both named after January 28th to mark the everlasting commemoration. The entire project took less than two months from start to finish, and due to limited funds, I could only proceed with limited resources. Initially, the plan was to create eleven large and small murals in the hall and collect various January 28th publications, photographs, and war trophies for observation. However, due to funding issues, I reluctantly created one large painting and six small paintings. Also, because I was transferred to Fujian, I had to quickly complete it in a short period of time. The collection of items is not yet complete, and even the items from the 19th Route Army have not been sent. It is still far from what was initially planned. At this time, it is only a rough outline. How to enrich it and how to adorn it in the future depends on the assistance of my colleagues and gentlemen from all walks of life. Most of the items collected in this hall were donated by various agencies, bookstores, newspapers, and film companies. We have only slightly organized them, divided them into charts, and pasted them into albums for display. I should thank all the donors. The News, the Shih Pao, and the Times each donated the entire newspaper from the time of the burning of the Sanyou Society to the withdrawal of troops during the Shanghai battle. These are very rare and valuable souvenirs, and I am extremely grateful. Also, Mr. Zhang Yunqiao, who painted the murals for us, worked tirelessly and volunteered his services. He completed all the paintings in two weeks, and his spirit is admirable. This is something we are especially grateful for. Today, I would also like to express my gratitude for the many precious items that people from all walks of life have sent to enrich this hall. I will never forget these things. Today, I would like to express my gratitude for all of these things here. Finally, I have a few words to say. I have been in Shanghai for a long time, and twenty months have passed in a flash. In these twenty months, I have not done anything, but all of you gentlemen and people from all walks of life have always been helping me. I am very grateful for this kindness, and I also feel very ashamed. Fortunately, there have not been any major incidents in these twenty months, which has allowed me to fulfill my passive responsibilities. This is all thanks to the guidance and assistance, both tangible and intangible, of all of you gentlemen and people from all walks of life. I rarely have the opportunity to gather with you. Although it is not yet certain whether I will go to Fujian, I will be leaving Shanghai soon. Today, I would like to take this opportunity to say goodbye to you, and at the same time, I have a request to make of you. Even though I am leaving this place and leaving you, I still hope that you will give me your guidance and assistance at any time, just as if I were still by your side. I feel that what can be separated in life is the form, but the spirit will never be separated. What do you think? I think you will all agree to my request and help me achieve this hope."</p>
<h3 id="e124">Mayor's Speech <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>After the Chairman's report, Mayor Wu Tiecheng gave a speech, saying, "The late Premier Sun Yat-sen said that it is not necessary for a person to become a high official, but it is necessary to do great things." I believe that to do great things, one must first establish a goal and make a firm resolution in order to succeed in a lasting and immortal undertaking. Considering the four days before the January 28th Incident, which was January 24th, Commander Dai and General Commander Chiang Kai-shek, along with Military Commander Cai, held a meeting and made a firm decision to defend Shanghai to the death. This led to the January 28th Resistance against Japan, which added a page of self-respect and glory to the history of the Chinese nation. Today, the significance of Commander Dai's construction of the January 28th Memorial Hall is threefold: first, to commemorate the advance resolution of the January 28th Resistance against Japan warriors; second, to teach about shame and war, inspiring the citizens' awareness; and third, for our compatriots across the country to never forget the officers and soldiers who sacrificed themselves here when they see this January 28th Memorial Hall. Shanghai, as a corner, is the gateway to the capital, the barrier of the central hub for issuing orders, and the center of the national economy and the starting point for national undertakings. The safety of Shanghai is related to the national lifeline. With the meager forces of the 19th Route Army and the 5th Army, and with inferior equipment, we resisted the power of the Japanese navy, army, and air force, maintaining safety. The resolution of a few people has accomplished this great undertaking, which can truly be called a lasting and immortal achievement. We should never forget it. Today, as we come to attend the completion ceremony of the January 28th Memorial Hall, I would like to contribute and encourage myself to all compatriots across the country. All Shanghai citizens should especially not forget Commander Dai's great achievements. Now that Commander Dai is about to leave us, the citizens of Shanghai should express their gratitude to this key figure who stabilized Shanghai during the extremely difficult January 28th Resistance against Japan for more than twenty months."</p>
<h3 id="e125">Other Speeches <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>In addition to Mayor Wu, guest speakers also included Jiang Huaixu, representing the Municipal Party Committee; Ye Fei, representing the 88th Division; Huang Hechun, director of the 19th Route Army's Beijing Office; Yang Hu, head of the Security Department; and Zhu Qinglan, Lin Kanghou, and Sun Weifan. Jiang Huaixu expressed his hope that the day the January 28th Memorial Hall is demolished will be the day our country avenges its shame. Ye Fei expressed his hope that all compatriots across the country will mobilize and overthrow imperialism. Huang Hechun expressed his hope that the people of the country will continue to work hard, carrying forward the spirit of the soldiers and civilians who died in the January 28th Incident. Zhu Qinglan stated that the January 28th Memorial Hall is a memorial to: (1) the great spirit of the Chinese nation, (2) the determination of the soldiers to defend the country, and (3) the power of cooperation between the military and the people. Lin Kanghou briefly stated that those in power must like what the people like and hate what the people hate, so that cooperation can be effective and we can unite against foreign enemies. The January 28th Incident is an example of this, and so on.</p>

At the top of the mound is the memorial碑to the officers and soldiers who died in the January 28th Incident, covered with the party-state flag. After the completion ceremony, Commander Dai unveiled the party-state flag amidst the sound of music, and then paid his respects to the 碑. After the ceremony, the meeting was adjourned.</p>

<p>After the completion ceremony of the January 28th Memorial Hall yesterday, in order to allow people from all walks of life to understand the truth of the Songhu Battle, it was specifically decided to open it for two days, August 11th and 12th, for people to visit.

<h3 id="e130">Zhu Qinglan Cables Li Du <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>Requesting investigation of claims regarding the four-six split, etc.</p>
<p>Zhu claims all donations have receipts as proof</p>
<p>The public should be openly informed of any doubts</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of donations for resisting Japan and saving the nation, since Ma Zhanshan announced the detailed amount of donations he received, various organizations have been conducting investigations. On August 2nd, General Zhu Qinglan received a cable from General Li Du inquiring about the anti-Japanese donations. He immediately replied with an airmail cable, explaining the process of the donations. However, on the 8th, the "Jing Bao" newspaper in this city published a news article of an interview with General Li Du, which raised doubts about General Zhu. Zhu sent another cable to General Li Du on the 9th, requesting an investigation. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e131">Zhu Qinglan's Remarks <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, a reporter from this newspaper interviewed General Zhu Qinglan, asking about the points raised in General Li Du's cable. According to him, he did indeed receive Li's cable on the 2nd of this month and immediately replied by express airmail cable. However, upon recently reading the "Jing Bao" containing a record of an interview with General Li, there were claims of a four-six split of the donations and the establishment of a school with 500,000 yuan. These claims are completely untrue and he does not know what they are based on. He cabled Li yesterday to request an investigation, because personal reputation is a small matter, but the future of resisting Japan is of great importance. All the donations he handled were used according to the purposes designated by the donors, and the donors were informed separately. Reports were also made for donations without designated purposes. Those remitted through banks also have official receipts from the banks. The accounts of donations and payments received by the local Righteous Army Support Association, the Northeast Refugee Relief Association, and other organizations are reported every ten days and sent to the donors. The procedures are extremely clear. The public should be openly informed of any questions, and all have receipts as proof, etc.</p>
<h3 id="e132">General Li's Cable to Zhu <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>General Li Du's cable to General Zhu Qinglan reads: Since the September 18th Incident, compatriots at home and abroad have enthusiastically supported the Northeast Anti-Japanese Armies, donating generously. In reality, the various units of the Northeast Anti-Japanese forces received very few of these donations. During the intense fighting, patriotic heroes shed blood on the battlefield, and the elders and children were trampled under the iron hooves of the enemy. It was tragic and heartbreaking, until we were exhausted and the Northeast fell. It is said that Mr. Zhu has received more than 3.8 million yuan in donations. Who exactly did you assist? There are many misunderstandings among the various parties, saying that Mr. Zhu has been deceived. I hope you will publish in the newspapers the detailed amount and purpose of each donation you have received, to comfort the people of the country. This not only concerns personal integrity, but also concerns the kind people who have ruined their families to relieve the country's difficulties and the gentlemen who have generously rewarded the troops. If they know that the use is improper, they will lose faith. Who will still be willing to do what is right? This is of utmost importance to the future of the national crisis. I remember that you, sir, have long been admired by the people for rescuing the afflicted and helping the needy. This is precisely to maintain your good name, not because I personally have any dissatisfaction. I hope you understand. Li Du bows.</p>
<h3 id="e133">Zhu Cables Request for Investigation <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>General Zhu Qinglan sent another cable to General Li Du on the 9th, requesting an investigation. The original cable reads: Mr. Li Zhichu, Gu Ling Xun Jian: I received your cable and replied with a winter cable sent by airmail, which should have reached you long ago. Recently, I saw a news article in the Shanghai "Jing Bao" on August 8th, a record of an interview with General Li Du. The original article recorded your conversation with the interviewee regarding anti-Japanese donations, including the following paragraph: "We issue a receipt for 10,000 yuan, but actually only receive 6,000 yuan. The remaining 40% is taken by General Zhu to be used for anti-Japanese purposes, a four-six split. We alone take the credit for it. Also, General Zhu used 500,000 yuan of the donations to establish a school. Although running a school is also beneficial to the country, it seems to deviate from the original intention of the public's donations." The above is all without any factual basis. Reading it makes me feel particularly lost. In addition to sending you the original newspaper, I have specifically listed the following points to clarify the truth: (1) Is the conversation recorded in the newspaper actually true? (2) If the conversation is true, then there are the following two points: "Issuing a receipt for 10,000 yuan, but actually only receiving 6,000 yuan," please point out the facts and the person in charge. (3) What is the basis for the so-called "using 500,000 yuan of the donations to establish a school"? Also, in your conversation, you said, "I heard that the amount donated in Shanghai does not match the amount received." I do not know who you heard it from. What is the fact that they do not match? This matter concerns public trust and affects the future of resisting Japan. I cannot remain silent. I hope you will clarify it to correct the hearing. Sincerely, Zhu Qinglan bows. Qing.</p>

It then subsidized the Qinghai expedition to conduct actual cultural and educational surveys of the frontier regions of Suiyuan, Gansu, Ningxia, Xiaqinghai and other provinces. It is now heard that the center has recently decided to hire Zhao Ximeng as the center's Xinjiang investigation specialist, responsible for investigating the current situation in Xinjiang Province.

<h3 id="e139">Preparing to Name Five Aircraft <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>Preparatory Committee of Five Organizations Holds Third Meeting Yesterday</p>
<p>Lin Wojang to Report on Reasons for Delayed Assembly</p>
<p>Li Dachao to Report on Reasons for Changing Venue</p>
<p>Resolution to Form Groups and Report on Donation Receipts</p>
<p>The joint naming ceremony for five aircraft has been postponed due to the assembly in Hangzhou not being completed in time. The preparatory committee of the five organizations held its third meeting yesterday. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>(Reasons for Delayed Assembly) Attendees: Li Dachao (Chairman), Lin Wojang, Mao Heyuan, Zhou Nianhang (Secretary), Wang Enchi, Wang Xianggao, Wang Gang. First, Lin Wojang reported on his visit to Hangzhou to inspect the assembly of the five aircraft. He briefly stated that after the preparatory committee decided to hold the five aircraft naming ceremony on August 12th, he immediately telegraphed the Hangzhou Aviation Department and sent a letter to the American mechanic responsible for assembling the five aircraft to urge him. Because he did not receive a definite reply, he went to Hangzhou on the evening of the 6th to inspect. Because only one American mechanic, Mr. Guler, and two assistants were responsible for assembling the five aircraft, and the workers of the Aviation Department were not able to participate, only three aircraft have been assembled. Testing the engines and measuring all the machinery will also take a considerable amount of time. It is estimated that they will be assembled around the 20th of this month. He has already asked the Aviation Department to inform them by telegram when the time comes, etc.</p>
<p>(Reasons for Changing Venue) Next, Li Dachao reported that the naming ceremony was originally planned to be held at the Jiangwan Racecourse. After he and Secretary Zhang Tingrong of the Municipal Government contacted the Shanghai Amateur Sports Federation, they agreed to lend it to them. However, because the location was too small to accommodate the take-off and landing of five aircraft, he and the Aviation Association discussed and decided to change the venue to the Hongqiao Airfield to avoid any danger. For the comfort and safety of the attendees, appropriate arrangements and convenient transportation should be arranged in advance, etc.</p>
<p>(Resolution to Distribute Work) It was then decided to change the location to the Hongqiao Airfield. The date will be decided after receiving a telegram from the Aviation Department and convening another meeting. It was also decided to establish seven groups: Transportation, General Affairs, Reception, Arrangement, Security, Guard, and Publicity, to be responsible for handling the matters. The Municipal Government should increase the frequency of public buses to and from the arrangement and transportation aspects. The Municipal Government should rush to arrange it recently. The preparatory committee must go to inspect after the arrangement is appropriate. As for the fourth preparatory meeting, it should be convened temporarily when the time is right.</p>
<p>(Report on Donation Receipts) Then, Mao Heyuan reported that the Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association's aviation national salvation donations will be handed over to the Aviation Association in the next few days. If all the donations are more than enough to supply an aircraft, the surplus can be donated to the Ningbo No. 2 aircraft, etc. Wang Gang reported that the Boy Scouts Council handed over more than 20,000 yuan yesterday. Ye Xianggao reported that the General Labor Union had handed over 28,900 yuan yesterday. Finally, Zhou Nianhang reported that the General Team Leader's Office had received donations recently, including 16,085.20 yuan from the Shanghai Educational Association, 28,000 yuan from the Shanghai General Labor Union's Shanghai Workers' Aircraft Fundraising Committee, 3,000 yuan from the Shanghai Student Union of Secondary Schools, 9,500 yuan raised by Gu Jiatang, 4 silver dollars donated by Wang Desen, and 2 silver dollars donated by Gu Zhenyi, etc. The meeting then adjourned.</p>

<p>Decision in One Week</p>
<p>According to the National News Agency, the all-metal Tianchu fighter aircraft ordered by Tianchu Monosodium Glutamate Factory from the German Junkers Factory was damaged in a crash during a test flight. Because the aircraft has not been formally delivered, Tianchu Factory believes that the seller should be fully responsible. The Zenchhen Trading Company, which is managing the matter, believes that the test flight was insured at the time, so the insurance company cannot shirk its responsibility. The buyer, Tianchu Factory, has no responsibility whatsoever. The seller, Junkers Factory, the Zenchhen Trading Company, and the insurance company are currently studying the issue of responsibility. The procedures and methods for returning or replacing the aircraft can probably be decided within a week. However, Tianchu Monosodium Glutamate Factory believes that the deposit has been paid long ago, but the delivery has been delayed for various reasons. The interest on this large deposit should be moderately refunded by the seller to ensure fairness and avoid excessive losses. There has been no response to this point yet.</p>

<p>Cultural Relics from Four Institutions, Including the Museum, Stored in Shanghai</p>
<p>Total of 19,492 Boxes</p>
<p>Ma Heng, Director of the Palace Museum, and Zhuang Shangyan, member of the Provisional Supervisory Committee, entertained reporters from local newspapers at Yipinxian the day before yesterday. Yesterday, a reporter from the National News Agency, noting that although the museum had rented two warehouses to store the cultural relics relocated from the south, the exact number of boxes and their storage situation had never been announced, made a special trip to inspect them. The staff members Huang Pengxiao and Zhao Sijie received him. The confirmed number of boxes and the storage situation are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>(Confirmed Number of Boxes of Cultural Relics Relocated from the South) Cultural relics from the Palace Museum in Beiping, the Exhibition Hall of the Ministry of Interior in Beiping, the Summer Palace in Beiping, and the Imperial College were relocated to Shanghai for storage due to the situation at the time. There were a total of five batches, stored in two warehouses at No. 26 Tianzhutang Street and No. 32 Sichuan Road. The "First Batch" consisted of 2,118 boxes belonging to the museum: 452 boxes from the Antiquities Department, 602 boxes from the Library, and 1,064 boxes from the Archives Department. The "Second Batch" consisted of 1,490 boxes: 790 boxes from the Antiquities Department, 44 boxes from the Library, 436 boxes from the Archives Department, and 20 boxes from the Secretariat of the museum, plus 200 boxes from the Exhibition Hall. The "Third Batch" consisted of 3,860 boxes and 62 packages: 592 boxes from the Antiquities Department, 477 boxes from the Library, 1,240 boxes from the Archives Department, and 663 boxes from the Secretariat of the museum, plus 814 boxes from the Exhibition Hall and 74 boxes from the Summer Palace. The "Fourth Batch" consisted of 6,269 boxes and 2 packages, plus 5 items: 829 boxes from the Antiquities Department, 138 boxes from the Library, 133 boxes from the Archives Department, and 2,635 boxes and 2 packages from the Secretariat of the museum, plus 1,400 boxes from the Exhibition Hall, 223 boxes and 5 items from the Summer Palace, and 11 boxes from the Imperial College.

In total, the five batches of cultural relics consisted of 19,492 boxes, plus 72 packages and 8 items. Among them, 13,427 boxes and 64 packages belonged to the Palace Museum, and 6,065 boxes, plus 8 packages and 8 items, belonged to the Exhibition Hall, the Summer Palace, and the Imperial College.</p>
<p>(Storage Situation in the New and Old Warehouses) Regarding the storage of cultural relics, the old warehouse on Tianzhutang Street has seven floors, while the new warehouse on Sichuan Road only rents one floor out of two, the remaining floors being rented by other businesses. Because the protection is not very thorough, only 3,528 boxes of archives from the Archives Department of the museum are stored in the new warehouse, while the rest are placed in the old warehouse on Tianzhutang Street. The first floor stores 446 boxes and one package: 44 boxes from the Archives Department, 13 boxes and one package of cultural relics from the Secretariat, 376 boxes from the Exhibition Hall, 2 boxes from the Summer Palace, and 11 boxes from the Imperial College. The second floor stores 2,070 boxes: 1,525 boxes from the Secretariat and 545 boxes from the Exhibition Hall.

<h3 id="e142">Opinions of Chinese-owned Cotton Mills on American Cotton Loans <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>According to the National News Agency, sources from Chinese-owned cotton mills revealed yesterday that domestic cotton supply has consistently fallen short of demand, making the purchase of American cotton for replenishment a common practice. For instance, last year, China produced 8 million dan of cotton (according to the China Cotton Industry Statistics Association's survey), while the cotton mills' demand reached 9 million dan (according to the Chinese Cotton Mill Owners' Association's survey). Additionally, about 4 million dan are estimated for cotton clothing linings. The deficit is naturally covered by imported cotton.</p>
<p>In the past twenty years, 4.8 million dan of cotton were imported, and 3.8 million dan in the twenty-first year. This year, due to the balancing of supply and demand, the shortfall is about 5 million dan. Moreover, Chinese-owned cotton mills are experiencing tight cash flow due to the aftermath of the January 28th Incident (Shanghai Incident of 1932). The exchange rate is unfavorable,</p>
<p>gold prices are too high, and domestic cotton prices are high while yarn prices are low, a difference of about 20 yuan. In desperation, many cotton mills have temporarily suspended operations. Minister Song Ziwen, taking the opportunity of attending the World Economic Conference and complying with the requests of domestic cotton mills, negotiated with the U.S. government for cotton and wheat loans. However, despite the U.S. government's successful efforts in maintaining ample supply of American cotton, prices have not fallen. It remains to be seen whether distressed Chinese-owned cotton mills can resume operations due to government purchases of large quantities of American cotton, as it depends on the cost. As for the government purchasing American cotton and then selling it to Japanese merchants, Chinese-owned cotton mills can only</p>
<p>express regret. The Chinese and Japanese cotton mills are fundamentally in a mutually exclusive position. If Japanese merchants need American cotton, they can directly order from American firms like Anderson, Clayton &amp; Co. and Amcot, and the prices would be cheaper. The resale is actually done out of jealousy to prevent Chinese merchants from buying cotton and alleviate the cotton shortage, thereby weakening market competitors. Therefore, the purchase by Japanese merchants is not out of need, but</p>
<p>a competitive tactic. Chinese-owned cotton mills dare not oppose the government, nor can they oppose Japanese merchants. However, the government funding the market rivals of Chinese cotton mills is unwise and may be ridiculed. Chinese-owned cotton mills still hope that the rumors are untrue, or that Minister Song Ziwen, upon returning from abroad, will fully understand the situation and change course, adhering to the original intention of</p>
<p>aiding Chinese merchants, and seeking low-interest loan solutions. However, it is expected that Japanese merchants will not be willing to purchase all the cotton, and the small amount of American cotton purchased for competitive purposes will not harm Chinese merchants. As for the Chinese-owned cotton mills, they do not oppose the government's cotton loan initiative, but are most concerned about</p>
<p>the use of the funds. People buy cloth to make clothes, cotton mills spin yarn to weave cloth, and American firms like Anderson, Clayton &amp; Co. pre-order American cotton for spinning. In essence, people create a multilayered leak to make clothes. Now, the government purchases American cotton, requiring repayment of principal and interest over five years. If managed well, it can reduce the leakage and generate profits. The cotton price is 200 million yuan, with a term of five years. If the government uses this fund for construction projects, only needing to allocate 1% to cotton planting, the effect would be immediate and the benefit significant. Production could increase dramatically, and cotton prices would stabilize. Wouldn't this be a great policy? Otherwise, the cotton funds'</p>
<p>whereabouts would be unknown, and after five years, the people would have to bear the repayment, essentially making people pay the price of two sets of clothes for one set. This is why there is so much concern. Currently, the government has not indicated anything to the cotton mills, and it is uncertain whether the cotton mills have the ability to purchase cotton at a high price and spin low-priced yarn. Everything depends on Minister Song Ziwen's return and the relief measures he proposes before deciding on the extent of adoption.</p>
<h3 id="e143">Growing Unrest over Fixed-Quota Tax on Tobacco and Alcohol <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>Earth-yellow wine and Shaoxing wine industries have ceased production and transportation.</p>
<p>Soy sauce and rice wine industry decided to suspend operations after stocks are sold out.</p>
<p>Since the Ministry of Finance's Tax Affairs Department abolished the public monopoly on tobacco and alcohol and implemented a fixed-quota tax on July 1, despite consistent efforts by the tobacco and alcohol industries and chambers of commerce to seek relief, the earth-yellow wine industry has ceased production and transportation. The Shaoxing wine industry has decided to suspend operations after its inventory is sold out. The unrest is spreading. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Shaoxing Wine Transportation Halted. The Shaoxing Wine Industry Association stated that the public monopoly on tobacco and alcohol has been in place for twenty years. Now, the Tax Affairs Department has issued new regulations, abolished the public monopoly, and increased tax rates, causing members' Shaoxing wine shipments from Shaoxing, Zhejiang, to various places to be detained, resulting in irreparable losses. Forcing them to affix stamps and pay taxes is a disguised form of likin (internal transit tax). The association's repeated appeals were ineffective, making it impossible to operate. The association has decided to unanimously halt the transportation of Shaoxing wine from Zhejiang to various places and has reported the suspension to the United Association for assistance.</p>
<p>Earth-Yellow Wine Production Stopped. The Earth-Yellow Wine Industry Association stated that the Tax Affairs Department's new fixed-quota tax regulations require immediate stamping of all produced wine, increasing tax rates and severely impacting business. After repeated appeals were ineffective, they were forced to suspend production starting August 1 and reported the suspension to the United Association for assistance. As a result, all earth-yellow wine workshops in Pudong have closed, causing panic among winemaking workers. The Winemaking Workers' Union submitted a petition to the City Party Headquarters and the Social Affairs Bureau, requesting relief to prevent workers from losing their jobs.</p>
<p>Soy Sauce and Rice Wine Industry to Suspend Operations. The Soy Sauce and Rice Wine Industry Association issued a declaration stating that since the Tax Affairs Department abolished the public monopoly and implemented a fixed-quota tax, members of the soy sauce and rice wine industry have been uneasy. They were willing to reluctantly accept a slight increase in tax rates, but complicated procedures and frequent penalties have made merchants fearful. The fixed-quota tax is too idealistic and impractical. The authorities were aware that it could not be fully implemented and stipulated that implementing details would be separately formulated according to each province's situation as a remedy, proving that the fixed-quota tax regulations are not immutable. Furthermore, the Tax Affairs Department repeatedly stated that it would accommodate commercial interests and discuss the matter at length. Those handling tax collection should uphold the intention of higher ups, consider the circumstances, and benefit both tax revenue and commercial interests. It should not be handled with trickery to deceive the authorities. Unfortunately, the wrong people were used, and they acted unilaterally, inciting a few industry miscreants to disregard the public opinion of legitimate trade associations, leading to the unfortunate suspension of transportation and brewing by the Shaoxing Wine and Earth-Yellow Wine industries. The Earth-Yellow Wine industry's resolution is a painful one for the Soy Sauce and Rice Wine industry. After deliberation, the executive and supervisory committee decided to convene a members' meeting on August 4 to discuss the matter. After deliberation, it was resolved that, in addition to fully accepting the first point regarding storage and transportation issues, they would contact various wine industry groups to jointly fight for relief. If no effect is achieved and the source of wine is cut off, they would uniformly suspend operations and await a solution. It is believed that the intention of changing the tax regulations was to eliminate corruption and rectify tax revenue, and that they would not want one or two individuals to make a big mistake and disregard the livelihoods of millions of people. In the event that the unrest escalates and unfortunate incidents occur, affecting local security, they are willing to bear the responsibility and request that justice be upheld and that the people's lives be protected. Therefore, they hereby urgently inform all soy sauce and rice wine businesses in the city to immediately stop transporting all wine stored in various workshops. After selling off existing inventory, uniformly suspend operations to show their determination. This is the declaration.</p>
<p>Further Appeals. A reporter from the New Voice News Agency met with Zhang Dalian, executive director of the Soy Sauce and Rice Wine Industry Association, who stated that since the Tax Affairs Department implemented the new fixed-quota tax regulations, the Earth-Yellow Wine and Shaoxing Wine industries have been unable to bear the harsh taxes and have successively suspended production and transportation. The Soy Sauce and Rice Wine industry will be forced to suspend operations due to the interruption of supply. This is truly a last resort. In addition to requesting assistance from various sectors, they have decided to wait for Minister of Finance Song Ziwen to return to the country and then submit a petition to fight for relief, continuing until the goal of abolishing the fixed-quota tax is achieved to alleviate the difficulties of merchants and the people.</p>
<p>The Chamber of Commerce Federation Telegraphs the National Chamber of Commerce Federation Regarding the Harsh and Cumbersome New Regulations on Special Tobacco and Alcohol Taxes. Yesterday, it telegraphed the Ministry of Finance again, requesting the abolition of the regulations and the issuance of revised regulations. The original text is as follows: To the esteemed Ministry of Finance in Nanjing: It has come to our attention that the new regulations on special tobacco and alcohol taxes are harsh, cumbersome, and impractical. The association previously received telegrams from the Jiujiang City Chamber of Commerce in Jiangxi Province and the Siming County Tobacco and Alcohol Industry Association in Fujian Province requesting that the regulations be abolished and revised. The association telegraphed your ministry on July [blank] and [blank] of this year, requesting action. Today, we also received telegrams from the Wuxue City Chamber of Commerce in Hubei Province, the Shanghai Earth-Yellow Wine Industry Association, the Soy Sauce [blank] Industry Association, the Soy Sauce and Rice Wine Establishment Association, the Shaoxing Wine Industry Association, and the Liang [blank] Wine Trade Association.</p>
<p>In addition, representatives from various public organizations in Susong County, Anhui Province, came to the association and stated that the sales of local wine have been severely impacted by the dumping of American products and the interruption of the route to the Northeast. Farmers and workers who depend on it for their livelihoods are on the verge of collapse, and local wine is also affected by foreign wine, with business gradually declining. Now, the public monopoly has been changed to a special tax, and the tax rate has increased, even exceeding the selling price. Furthermore, they are ordered to pay the new tax on inventory that has already paid the old tax, making it impossible for merchants and the people to maintain their businesses. As a last resort, they have no choice but to suspend transportation and brewing to show their determination. They request that the goods that have already paid the old tax be exempted from the supplementary tax and that new regulations be revised. Upon receiving this, we found that the abolition of the old tax on the public monopoly of tobacco and alcohol and the issuance of new special tobacco and alcohol tax regulations were originally intended to unify the tax laws. Although the tax laws have been changed, the tax rates cannot be increased. Now, under the guise of changing tax laws, the reality is to increase tax rates. At this time when farmers, workers, and merchants are struggling with the precarious business of local wine, imposing heavier taxes that exceed the selling price is tantamount to cutting off their livelihoods. Moreover, the business of local wine is gradually declining due to the import of foreign wine, and what it relies on to survive is actually that its price is cheaper than foreign wine. Now that the tax rate has been increased and coupled with harsh and severe penalties, it seems that the government's intention to maintain commercial development has been lost. As for the goods that have already paid the old tax, ordering them to pay the new tax again violates the legal principle of not prosecuting past offenses. Moreover, before the new tax was issued, the old tax had already been paid, which means that the obligation to pay taxes has already been fulfilled. Due to sluggish sales, the goods have been accumulated to this day, and the warehouse rent and interest have already caused unbearable losses. If the new tax is levied again, it is a case of adding insult to injury. Because the association has witnessed the difficulties, we dare not hide them from the higher authorities. We hereby telegraph your ministry again to review the matter and request that the new regulations be abolished and revised, ensuring that both national plans and the people's livelihoods are considered. This is our earnest plea. Lin Kanghou, Chairman of the National Chamber of Commerce Federation, kowtows.</p>
<h3 id="e144">Declaration of Forced Workers of the Da Wan Bao <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>Dear compatriots, it is common in today's society for capitalists to oppress workers. Unexpectedly, the authorities of the Da Wan Bao are now using their insidious "discarding the bow after the birds are gone" tactics, wielding the power of capitalists, and seeking to put us to death. To fight for survival and justice, in addition to continuing to adhere to our consistent principles and fighting with the capital side based on reason, we can only make the general course public to society, and respectfully ask colleagues and the social sector to sympathize with us and provide strong assistance, so that weak workers and their families will not starve to death, and justice can be maintained. At that time, the authorities of the Da Wan Bao brought people to Tianjin, repeatedly stating how excellent the treatment of the Da Wan Bao was and how generous the wages were. Their sweet words and promises exhausted their ability to lure us with bait. Thinking of the desire and hope of the pitiful workers with weak knowledge and heavy burdens to "earn more money to support their families," the clever capitalists, the Da Wan Bao authorities, saw through the weaknesses of the poor and weak workers and took the opportunity to attack. Of course, who among us did not have hopes? And batches of us were caught on his hook and entered his snare, and successively left the work of the Tianjin Yong Bao and other newspapers, and came to Shanghai and joined the Da Wan Bao one after another. When we first arrived in Shanghai, it was when the Da Wan Bao was still under preparation, and it was also during the fierce "January 28th" Sino-Japanese war. We worked hard for the Da Wan Bao under the dangerous situation of rattling airplanes, booming artillery fire, and lives at risk in the morning and evening, never questioning. We ask ourselves if we have ever let down the Da Wan Bao authorities, but the world is full of people with unpredictable intentions, sinister means, and despicable actions, which, however, are shown by the well-dressed, so-called leaders of the press. The Da Wan Bao authorities, on the one hand, used the extremely tense period of the "January 28th" incident when people were eager for news, and on the other hand, tempted the workers to work hard, so that the newspaper took the lead in all Shanghai evening newspapers in less than a year. The Da Wan Bao's ability to develop so quickly and its plans to be so smooth are due to the efforts of the operators and, without being modest, mostly due to us workers! Suddenly, the Da Wan Bao authorities, for some unknown reason, suddenly declared to the factory on August 7 through manager Chen Yaozhu: "This newspaper is now in order to save expenses. From now on, the newspaper will be entrusted to the Shishi Xinbao for production. You workers who came to Shanghai from Tianjin at that time, there were three batches in succession. Now, according to the order of the authorities, the first batch will be temporarily retained here to be assigned to other affairs, and all the second and third batches of workers will be returned to Tianjin." What? What is this? Alas, the foundation of the Da Wan Bao is consolidated, the capitalist's pockets are full, the capitalists have no worries from now on, and they are deeply afraid that the workers will have any demands. Therefore, they implemented their preemptive poisonous plan and ignored the life and death of the workers. Who does not know that the Da Wan Bao and the Shishi Xinbao are two-in-one? Therefore, the newspaper authorities' insidious "discarding the bow after the birds are gone" tactics can be said to be a familiar trick, but this time it is applied to us who have traveled across mountains and rivers and have no way to retreat from our hometowns, which is even more ruthless and vicious. And their divisive tactics of temporarily retaining the first batch and dismissing the second and third batches are obvious. Now we can only fight with them at the cost of our lives. Our demands are not extravagant, we have no faults, but we only ask them to restore the original state and continue to work as usual. There is no need for the newspaper to save expenses. As for the coping strategies, if negotiations fail, we will inevitably find other appropriate ways to cope. However, workers have limited knowledge and weak strength, and during this struggle period, we hope that all colleagues and insightful people in society will take the warning of "the rabbit dies, the fox is sad" and give us practical and strong assistance, so that those who are dying will not die. The virtue of rebirth will be forever appreciated with endless gratitude. This is our declaration. The Committee of Forced Dismissal Workers of the Da Wan Bao weeps.</p>
<h3 id="e145">The Tax Affairs Department Explains the Fixed-Quota Tax Regulations for Local Wine <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>The Government's Rationale</p>
<p>Since the Ministry of Finance's Tax Affairs Department in this city changed to collecting fixed-quota taxes on local wine, the Shanghai Liang (Distilled) Wine Trade Association has repeatedly protested. The department yesterday issued an instruction to the Jiangsu Stamp Tax and Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Bureau, explaining in detail the seven points raised. The original instruction is recorded below: For the matter of instruction: It is reported that Huang Yuming, chairman of the Shanghai Liang Wine Trade Association, stated in his presentation that the changes in the public monopoly have harsh and cumbersome clauses that hinder commerce, requesting amendments or continued handling according to the old regulations, and attaching a detailed list of opinions. Based on this, it is found that the change to fixed-quota tax for local wine is for the purpose of consolidating the original fees and taxes of various provinces for unified collection. The method focuses on uniformity and simplifies procedures. All regulations on the fixed-quota tax for local wine have been submitted by the Ministry of Finance to the Executive Yuan and then to the National Government for the record, and have been announced and ordered to be followed. The provincial businesses, not understanding the regulations, have repeatedly submitted requests to postpone or amend them, and clear instructions have been issued and sent to the bureau for compliance. Now, after reading the chairman's presentation, there are still many misunderstandings. The first point regarding the procedures for large [blank] repackaging and affixing repackaging inspection certificates has already been separately regulated. Repackaging already taxed and affixed with certificates for retail sales in the local area does not require affixing another tax payment certificate, and this has also been clarified in a separate order, so there should be no difficulty, and there is no such thing as "one product, multiple taxes." The second point regarding taxation by weight has always been handled this way. The old regulations did not stipulate a starting point of 50 catties. If it were as stated in the presentation, then small [blank] and bottled wine produced locally and containing less than 50 catties could all be exempted, which is impossible. The third point regarding the scattered retail sale of small quantities, with irregular containers, and without sealing, the number of inspections is tight. If each piece were counted and certified, the procedures would be too trivial. Therefore, the new regulations change to checking and determining the number monthly, originally to accommodate business conditions. If this causes suspicion that when bulk sales are sluggish, they cannot be transported elsewhere, then all products can be packed into containers, sealed and certified, and a separate counter can be set up to open the seal for retail. Winemaking shops must not sell in bulk retail, so that they can be shipped out at any time. The fourth point regarding the time limit for transfer has been approved in the joint petition of the Shanghai-Nanjing-Suzhou Tobacco and Alcohol Industry Association, and the bureau will handle it at its discretion and submit it for approval. The fifth point regarding the starting point of 50 [blank] catties has no such provision in the regulations, as stated above. The sixth point regarding Article 23 of the new regulations, that those who temporarily stop brewing must seal the vats and stoves, and Article 24, that those who cease operations must destroy the ponds and stoves, the former refers to temporary suspension, and the latter refers to complete closure. The boundaries are very clear, and most provinces handled it this way under the old regulations. The chairman of the association, not having read the entire text of the new regulations, mistakenly believes that temporarily stopping brewing also requires destroying the ponds and stoves, no wonder it is difficult to implement. The seventh point regarding the fixed-quota tax rate is determined by consolidating the original taxes and fees of various provinces and collecting them uniformly. The old regulations for the public monopoly calculated the rate based on price, and market prices fluctuated constantly, easily leading to abuses. Therefore, it was changed to a fixed-quota tax based on quantity, specifically to facilitate merchants and is not comparable to increasing taxes. The Zhejiang vat tax is another item collected during the public monopoly era. In addition, there were also tobacco and alcohol donations, brewing household licenses, inspection fees, and other items collected at the same time, which have been in place for a long time. Since the new regulations were implemented, they have all been canceled, and only the fixed-quota tax is collected, simplifying the process, and the superiority of the new system lies in this. The presentation cites the weaknesses of the old tax as an excuse to hinder the new regulations, not only reversing the cause and effect, but also being ignorant of the facts. As for the new regulations, the product is collected at the place of production, and the import is collected at the place of entry, all collected at one point, and no longer taxed within the province, simplifying the process, which merchants should be happy to follow. The presentation states that the audit of wine shipped to Shanghai was stricter at the point of entry than at the point of exit, so how can the various local wines be prevented from infiltrating sales? The Shanghai local wine tax system has a long history of accumulated malpractices and has almost become a breeding ground for abuses. The special printed certificates are especially used as amulets to evade regulations. Since all locally produced and imported wines must be taxed and certified, unscrupulous merchants have lost their reliance and are resisting in every possible way, especially fighting for the special printed certificates. After repeated severe rebuttals, they have gradually complied. If, as stated in the presentation, we continue to follow the previous habits and handle them flexibly, we will not achieve the benefits of centralization and will only open the door to omissions. What benefit would there be? In short, national taxation values simplicity and fairness. The old regulations were confusing and cumbersome, which cannot be denied. The business community in various provinces has repeatedly requested amendments, so the new regulations were revised, hoping to benefit both the national treasury and business conditions. If there are difficulties in the procedures, we have broadly adopted public opinions and made changes to be as appropriate as possible. This department has been considerate of all businesses and is truly meticulous. Merchants who are not familiar with the regulations may have misunderstandings, which is understandable. The chairman, being in a leadership position in the association, should be well aware of the tax situation, yet he is still pointing out everything in detail, and his wording is especially inappropriate. It is inappropriate to request amendments or continue to handle things according to the old regulations. Regarding the aforementioned situation, order that each point be refuted and instruct the bureau to severely reprimand and instruct all businesses to comply with the new regulations and not to wait and see under any pretext. This is the order.</p>
<p>Commander of the American Asiatic Fleet</p>
<h3 id="e146">Admiral Hepburn to Arrive in Shanghai to Assume New Post <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>The Da Mei Evening News reports that the new Commander of the American Asiatic Fleet, Rear Admiral Hepburn, will arrive in Shanghai to assume his new post. He will arrive next Monday on the President Van Buren or next Tuesday on the President Jackson. The outgoing commander, Rear Admiral Taussig, will immediately return to the country after handing over the command, taking leave until about October and then retiring due to age. As the headquarters of the Asiatic Fleet is far from the home country and the political situation in the Far East is unstable, the position of commander is known as one of the most complex and responsible positions in the U.S. Navy. Therefore, his power is also uniquely large, exceeding that of other fleet commanders. Rear Admiral Hepburn is highly respected and previously served as the Director of Naval Operations in the Navy Department, his importance being second only to the Chief of Naval Operations. Due to the importance of the Far East, he was specially selected as commander. He arrived in Japan several weeks ago with his wife on the President Coolidge, where they met with Japanese officials and American expatriates. It is uncertain whether Mrs. Hepburn will accompany him to Shanghai or continue her tour of Japan.

<h3 id="e147">Issues 4 Million Yuan in Bonds <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>Has Been Filed with the Ministries of Finance and Industry</p>
<p>Currently in Negotiations with Banking Sector</p>
<p>For the purpose of developing its business, the Liuhegou Coal Mining Company in this city has specially submitted a request to the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry, in accordance with the Company Law, to issue 4 million yuan in company bonds in Shanghai. It is currently in negotiations with the banking sector in this city for underwriting, and it is expected that it will be launched on the market soon. The face value is divided into three types: 500 yuan, 1,000 yuan, and 10,000 yuan. The annual interest rate is set at 8%, and the principal and interest will be repaid in ten years. According to Gong Fengxiang, business director of the company, speaking to a reporter from the Xin Xin News Agency yesterday, the company's issuance of company bonds this time is entirely for its own business and is currently in progress. The company's mine is located in Henan, and it specializes in the production of bituminous coal. The entire workforce is approximately 5,000 people, and the average daily coal production is more than 2,000 tons. Unfortunately, since 1927, transportation on the Pinghan Railway has been hampered due to military influence, and the produced coal has been unable to be sold externally, causing the company's economy to be severely impacted. During these years, the authorities have made great efforts to maintain the livelihoods of the miners. Although transportation on the Pinghan Railway was restored in 1932, freight rates increased, so the accumulated losses were very large. The purpose of this bond issuance is to consolidate small amounts into larger amounts in order to settle some old debts.</p>

<p>Temporary Porridge Distribution by Police Stations</p>
<p>Seeking Public Places for Temporary Shelter</p>
<p>Instructing Local Leaders to Notify Disaster-Stricken Households to Register</p>
<p>Local Gentry to Request Construction of Low-Income Housing</p>
<p>Zhang Yigen, a native of Yancheng living at 76 Nancaonitang, Pudong, accidentally started a major fire while cooking the other day, causing an unprecedented disaster. Details have been reported in this newspaper. It is now learned that Yang Zhongquan, director of the Third District, First Precinct of the City Public Safety Bureau, considering that thousands of victims have been displaced after the fire, which is very pitiful, has instructed the police to purchase 12 shi (ancient Chinese unit of dry volume, equivalent to about 100 liters) of rice to provide porridge to all victims temporarily, maintaining the status quo. Regarding the aftermath, at 8:30 yesterday morning, Zhang Binghui, Section Chief of the Fourth Section of the Social Affairs Bureau, dispatched staff member Sui Zhao, along with Yin Guanzhi, Director of the Relief Division, and Zhang Boqin, staff member of the Household Registration Division, dispatched by Hong Qi, Section Chief of the Second Section of the City Public Safety Bureau, to investigate. Yang Zhongquan, director of the First Precinct of the Third District of Pudong, led them to inspect the area for a week and then returned to Shanghai at 12:00. Upon arriving at the Social Affairs Bureau, they consulted with Chen Lengseng, Director of the Relief Division, and others to discuss relief measures. It was decided that: 1) Director Yang should instruct local leaders to notify all disaster-stricken households to register their names and numbers of people first, and to temporarily maintain the situation while consulting with local gentry and dispatching police to find public places nearby, such as temples, for accommodation as much as possible; 2) If it is deemed necessary to build temporary shelters, then report to the Public Safety Bureau and the Social Affairs Bureau for approval. As for temporary relief measures, the Social Affairs Bureau will consult with Wang Yiting, chairman of the United Association of Charity Organizations, to find ways to provide relief, so as to prevent the victims from being displaced. It is reported that the local gentry in Pudong will submit a request to the city government to build low-income housing. Also reported, the fire in the Caotang area between Yangjiadu and Laobaidu in Pudong burned down more than 500 houses the day before yesterday. Because most of the residents there are poor people from Jiangbei, after the disaster, more than 2,000 people were displaced and were in a terrible state. The authorities have built shelters as temporary accommodation for the refugees, and the Dongtai Association of Fellow Townsmen in Shanghai is planning for the aftermath. Starting yesterday, they will first provide porridge and rice, and it is also heard that the meeting plans to convene various public organizations in Pudong to discuss the restoration of houses and various safety issues.</p>

<p>Likely the Wife of a Barber</p>
<p>Japan Dispatches Personnel to Shanghai to Investigate</p>
<p>A Teletype from Kobe on the 10th reports: Regarding the Shanghai Maru woman's corpse incident, the Hyogo Prefecture Criminal Investigation Division believes the crime is related to overseas Chinese and is conducting an investigation. The appearance of the corpse greatly resembles Qiao Ying (23 years old), the wife of Chen Chengyuan, a Chinese barber in Yamashita-cho, Yokohama City, who was sent back to Shanghai in the middle of last month due to bad behavior. Furthermore, the collection address for the luggage also reads Yokohama. A key to resolving the case may be found in this area. Therefore, the Kobe Maritime Police Department dispatched Criminal Investigation Department Head Lin on the Nagasaki Maru on the 12th to Shanghai.</p>
<p>A Teletype from Kobe on the 10th reports: Regarding the Shanghai suitcase corpse case, the Kobe Police Department's forensic report and documents, etc., were brought to Shanghai today by the Shanghai Maru. After arriving in Shanghai, await the activities of the consular police. As for the fingerprints of the Chinese woman's corpse, due to severe decay, extraction was difficult. Fortunately, the fingerprints of both hands have been completely extracted. However, the fingerprints of Chen Qiao Ying (23), the wife of Chen Yongyuan, a barber in Yokohama, who is suspected to be the corpse, are currently under investigation. Because Qiao Ying was a promiscuous woman, she was sent back to Shanghai on July 22nd, and it is known that she stayed at a certain hotel near Jiujiang Road at the end of last month, but her whereabouts are unknown since then.</p>

<p>Police and Thugs Engage in Fierce Gunfight</p>
<p>One-Eyed Robber Surrenders</p>
<p>A portion of the bridge surface of Zhongshan Bridge, No. 4 Zhongshan Road, Zhabei, is currently damaged. Therefore, the Municipal Works Bureau is currently trying to repair it as quickly as possible. All vehicles passing over the bridge must proceed slowly. Yesterday at around 1:00 PM, Dai Yougen, who grows flowers in Miaotou (i.e., Pengpu Town), was riding his own bicycle from east to west to Miaotou Garden for business. When the bicycle reached the end of the bridge, Dai got off and pushed the bicycle across the bridge to prevent damage to the bridge construction. Unexpectedly, after Dai crossed the bridge and had only walked a few steps, a person suddenly stepped forward to block his path, claiming that he was carrying private goods, and searched him thoroughly. Finding nothing, the thug, not wanting to leave empty-handed, pulled out a handgun and told Dai that he was sorry and wanted to borrow his bicycle, and warned him not to make any noise, otherwise he would use the handgun, etc. After speaking, he got on the bicycle and sped off towards the east. At that time, there were several plainclothes security team members nearby who inquired about the situation and blew their whistles wildly. Wang Shifu, the squad leader of the 4th District Public Security Bureau's detective team, along with detectives Fang Chaofu and others, were on patrol. Police officer Tian Xiancheng from the Tanziwan branch station also pursued one after another. The thug, realizing that things were not going well, panicked and fell off the bicycle, hitting his left eye corner on the bricks and stones, causing profuse bleeding. Seeing that the police and security team were close behind, he drew his handgun and fired wildly. The police officers also took cover by the roadside and returned fire several times. After a fierce battle lasting several minutes, the thug was apprehended and a White Langlin handgun, No. 61386, was seized. There were still three bullets in the gun. The detectives, considering that the location was under the jurisdiction of the Tanziwan branch station, handed him over to Officer Tian to take to the station and escort him to the 4th District for interrogation. According to the thug, his name was Yao Afu, 42 years old, from Haimen, and he lived in a small inn on Sixth Malu in the concession. The rest of his words were cunning. The interrogating officer, seeing that Yao's eye corner was injured, ordered him to be sent to Pushan Hospital for bandaging first. Unexpectedly, upon closer inspection, the thug's right eye was already blind. He was wearing a white short shirt, and his entire body was covered in blood. He is currently being held in the 4th District for interrogation.</p>

<p>The home of Cao Ximing, a local farmer at No. 3 Zhu Jia Bridge, Cao Jia Garden, Hejing Town, Longhua, suddenly caught fire at around 8:00 AM yesterday. In an instant, flames burst through the roof, spreading to neighboring houses. Fortunately, the nearby patrol police received the news, reported it to the station chief, who instructed the fire brigade to rush pump trucks to the scene to extinguish the fire. By 9:50 AM, the fire was extinguished, with more than twenty thatched houses destroyed. At the time, neighbors nearby were mutually moving clothes and belongings, causing great disorder. Station Chief Wu Zhengding led the police to the scene to maintain order and conducted a preliminary investigation. According to reports, the cause of the fire was arson by a carpenter seeking revenge. Therefore, the station reported this to the general bureau for record-keeping and is investigating the perpetrator for arrest and prosecution.</p>
<h3 id="e152">French Concession Authorities Actively Eradicating "Poison Pills" <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>Catching Those Who Catch Themselves, Selling Those Who Sell</p>
<p>Dispatching More Detectives to Strictly Enforce Day and Night</p>
<p>Recently, the sales of "red pills" in this port have been so widespread that, according to those familiar with the matter, the daily sales volume actually surpasses that of opium. However, upon examining its origins, the French Concession is the place where it all began. Among them, the most reputable and widely sold is the "No. 11" brand of red pills. These poison pills were originally created at No. 11 Yu Kang Lane, Route Pichon, in the French Concession. As sales increased, it was named after the location. Recently, the police authorities of the French Concession have been extremely strict in investigating and prohibiting red pills. Anyone caught manufacturing, selling, or consuming red pills is sent to court for severe punishment. The police have now discovered that these retail red pill sellers have been using Zilaihuo Street, Ruifu Lane, as their base. Like cunning rabbits, they change their hiding place several times a day, sometimes in the lane, sometimes in the middle of the road, as well as in cigarette shops and snack stalls. There have been daily arrests. Therefore, the patrol chief has dispatched more Chinese and Vietnamese patrol officers to patrol the area around Zilaihuo Street and Ruifu Lane day and night, and has also sent undercover agents to patrol the alleys at night to eliminate the toxic atmosphere.</p>

<p>Detective Was a Thief</p>
<p>Four Shots Fired, Injuries Very Serious</p>
<p>Hu Jili, detective No. 329 of the Huishan Police Station in Tilanqiao, suddenly received a tip at around 7:00 PM last night, claiming that thieves were hiding in a certain house in Jun'an Lane, Yuezhou Road, planning to commit robbery. After receiving the report, Hu reported to the patrol chief and dispatched the entire armed detective team to arrest them. Upon entering the house, they indeed saw eight or nine thieves gathered and talking. Upon seeing the detectives, they scattered like birds and beasts, trying to escape. The detectives then rushed forward and captured five of them on the spot, and also confiscated firearms and other items in the house. The other four thieves took the opportunity to escape through the back door. One of them, wearing a blue cloth shirt and trousers, ran barefoot along Yuezhou Road from north to south towards Zhoujiazui Road. Upon seeing this, Detective Hu immediately led the detectives in pursuit, blowing his whistle wildly to warn the patrol officers. At the same time, the detectives with guns fired at the thief. However, the thief was agile and dodged the bullets. Seeing that the pursuit was very close and whistles were blaring, he turned east from Zhoujiazui Road and fled towards Zhoushan Road. Detective Hu, disregarding his own safety, held his handgun and ran ahead, leading the pursuit. At this time, two Chinese patrol officers, No. 2144 and 1952, were on duty at the intersection of Zhoushan Road. Seeing a person in short clothes and a person in long clothes running towards them, with detectives chasing behind, whistles blowing frequently, and gunshots intermittent, they knew something was wrong and quickly prepared for action. When the two people ran up to them, they saw that Detective Hu was still tightly holding his handgun and running forward, about three or four feet away from the person in short clothes, but he never fired his gun. In Detective Hu's mind, he hoped to capture the thief alive. Unexpectedly, Chinese patrol officer No. 2144, seeing Detective Hu wearing long clothes and holding a handgun, running in front, mistakenly thought he was an accomplice of the thief. He pulled out his service pistol and fired four shots at the two people in front, two of which hit Detective Hu. As a result, Hu fell to the ground, bleeding profusely, and the thief still escaped. At this time, the detectives behind had already tracked them down and saw Hu lying on the ground, covered in blood. Believing that he had been attacked by the thief, they quickly unbuttoned his shirt, intending to first remove Hu's bulletproof vest. It was then that Chinese patrol officer No. 2144 realized that he had mistakenly wounded Hu. He quickly reported to the police station and sent a car to rush Hu to the patrol police hospital for treatment. After examination by the hospital, it was discovered that he had two injuries, one in the neck, which was very serious, and one in the right arm. Afterwards, four shell casings from the Chinese patrol officer's gun were recovered at the scene of the incident and are now being held in the police station. They will be interrogated after Detective Hu's injuries have healed. The five thieves who were captured are also being temporarily held in the police station while they wait to apprehend the other accomplices and handle the case together.</p>

<p>A Er and A San Conspire to Abduct a Married Woman</p>
<p>False Benevolence, Alas, the Heart of a Woman</p>
<p>Shen Shunfa, 25 years old, from Wuxi, used to make a living by farming in his hometown. With the encouragement of his parents, he married a woman surnamed Wang from Wuxing through a matchmaker. After she joined the family, the relationship between the couple was still harmonious. However, because Shen's family was not very wealthy, it was often difficult to solve the problem of firewood and rice. Therefore, not long after their marriage, Wang came to Shanghai alone in 1930 and worked as a maid for a certain family through an introduction, lasting for more than two years. Recently, she was laid off and temporarily resided in Wu Baoji's employment agency at No. 1147 Triangular Street, South City, and asked for an introduction to an employer. A man from Haimen named A Er, over 30 years old and not yet married, who worked as a cart driver in the Shangnanchuan Salt Guild Hall near the employment agency, often went to the agency to chat during his free time. He saw that Wang was young and beautiful, so he often made suggestive remarks and frequently tried to seduce her. Before long, the two of them became entangled in a scandalous affair. Unexpectedly, good things are often difficult to come by. Recently, Shen heard about the matter and rushed to Shanghai yesterday to Wu Baoji's employment agency to order his wife to return home. Wang firmly refused, and secretly discussed with A Er to temporarily appease her husband, and when Shen took her to the pier to board the ship, she would take the opportunity to escape to his house, and gave her two yuan for travel expenses. Wang was overjoyed with the plan, and returned to the shop, falsely claiming to Shen that she was now willing to return home. Shen then accompanied her to Lao Laji Bridge. A Er suddenly remembered that he had now secretly instructed Wang to escape to his house, but he did not yet know the address of his house. He quickly wrote a note, writing down the address of his house, and asked a female acquaintance from Wuxing, Yan Yangshi, to catch up and hand the note to Wang. He also ordered his younger brother, A San, to secretly follow behind Shen and others, waiting for an opportunity to lead Wang away. When Shen and others arrived at Lao Laji Bridge, they boarded the inland small steamer and waited quietly for departure. However, Shen suddenly felt that the weather was hot, and fearing that he would be thirsty on the way, he asked Wang to wait on the steamer, and he went ashore again to buy a watermelon nearby, and brought it back to the steamer, preparing to cut it in the middle of the journey to quench his thirst. Unexpectedly, when he returned to the boat, Wang had already disappeared. He searched everywhere, but there was no trace of her. It turned out that when her husband went ashore to buy a melon, Wang had been led away by A San. Shen recalled that Yan Yangshi had given Wang a note, which was very suspicious, so he returned to Yan Yangshi's place to question her. She told the truth, and Shen realized that Wang must have been abducted by A Er. He rushed to the Salt Guild Hall to inquire about A Er's whereabouts, but the hall replied that A Er had now returned to his hometown. Shen was anxious, and took Yan Yangshi to the First Section of the First Precinct to request a thorough investigation. The Section Chief conducted a preliminary hearing and ordered a written report to be submitted to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for interrogation.</p>

<p>At 10:22 PM last night, the rooftop terrace of the Yao Xu Company at No. 150 East Lane, Qingchang Lane, Avenue Edouard VII, suddenly collapsed, injuring three people. Qingchang Lane was built by Zhou Genji and is more than twenty years old. Therefore, although the houses in the lane appear solid on the outside, their interiors have long been dilapidated. The landlords have repeatedly said they would rebuild, but have not done so. There is a Kong family tenant at No. 150, named Shi Jun, 32 years old. His father suddenly passed away the day before yesterday. Therefore, relatives and others came to help with the funeral yesterday. Because the weather was extremely hot, Kong Shi Jun, his cousin Wang Cifu, 15 years old, and a relative surnamed Qiu, 41 years old, went up to the rooftop terrace to cool off after nightfall. Unexpectedly, the wooden pillars of the terrace, due to years of decay, could not bear the weight and suddenly collapsed towards the house. The three people desperately tried to escape, and their feet were all injured by the fallen wooden pillars. It was fortunate that they were not crushed and fell down with the debris. At that time, they were helped downstairs by housemates and reported to the nearby patrol officer No. 1949, who sent them to Tongren Hospital for treatment. Fortunately, they were only slightly injured, so they were bandaged and discharged from the hospital.</p>

Unexpectedly, because his swimming skills were not good, he sank to the bottom of the river and did not resurface for a long time, resulting in a tragic drowning. After being discovered, people urgently reported to his father, Shigen, who immediately hired workers to salvage the body. It took a long time to find it, but he had already been dead for a long time. Shigen was overwhelmed with grief. He reported to the Fourth District General Office.

<p>Escaped from Prison and Fled to Shanghai, Districts Ordered to Assist in the Arrest</p>
<p>The Cunning Rabbit Burrows Thrice, Two Women Deny It</p>
<p>The Municipal Public Security Bureau of this port recently received a secret telegram from the Tai'an County Government in Shandong, stating that Ma Hongfu, a notorious bandit chieftain from Shandong, had no fewer than several thousand followers and had been rampaging in various counties and villages in Shandong, robbing, burning, killing, and kidnapping for ransom. He had committed no fewer than dozens of major cases. Many of his followers had been arrested by various counties. Last spring, Ma was arrested by Tai'an County and imprisoned. Unexpectedly, within a few months, Ma led prisoners in the prison to take advantage of an opportunity to escape from prison. There were dozens of them in total. Since then, Ma has been at large and has been strictly wanted without success. Now, according to a secret report, Ma and his gang are hiding in Caojiadu, Shanghai. Please arrest them immediately, etc. Director Wen of the bureau ordered District Chief Tan of the Sixth District to investigate the matter quickly. District Chief Tan ordered Patrol Officers Gu Shao and Wei to conduct an investigation. After a week of investigation, they discovered on the night before last that Ma had three residences: Singapore Road, Connaught Road, and Jinsitu Temple. They immediately led more than ten officers, disguised, to secretly go to these addresses. They arrested two women at the three locations, one surnamed Ding and one surnamed Zhang (said to be Ma's wives or concubines, but both firmly denied it). They also arrested more than twenty suspects, including Mi Yingming, Yu Xinghan, and Mi Hongjun, and brought them to the district for interrogation.</p>

Upon opening them, they were lotus root starch. Inside was a handgun, loaded with five bullets. Accomplices Wang Shouxun, Liu Bukuan, Jing Yuhuai, Zhang Zhizhao, Gong Zhaofang, and a woman, Qian Qiushi, all from Jiangbei, were also arrested at No. 569 Yulin Road. Fifteen bullets were seized. All were taken to the police station and transferred to the First Special District Court yesterday morning. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin stated the case, requesting a postponement. After questioning the defendants, the judge ordered them to be detained for further investigation and interrogation at a later date.</p>

<p>Yin Hua, the 15-year-old daughter of Yin Xushi, a woman from Jiading, who resides at No. 196 Ximen Lane, Ximen Road, French Concession, went out shopping on the afternoon of the 6th of this month at 2:30 PM with Jiang Peiying, a 17-year-old girl from No. 59 in the same lane. Lu Zhengde, 26 years old, from Zhenjiang, who resides at No. 4 Yumin Lane, Route Prusse, and works in office No. 10 of the Jianghai Customs, and his friend Cai Lianbi, 23 years old, from this county, saw them and went forward to strike up a conversation. The two girls, because they were young and ignorant, were actually seduced and went to a movie theater to watch a movie. Later, they went to the Carde Hotel at No. 8 Fuxu Lane, Route Carde, in the British Concession and opened rooms No. 36 and 37. Lu Zhengde raped Yin Hua, and Cai Lianbi raped Xue Peiying. They separated at 11:00 AM the next morning. When Yin Hua returned home, her mother discovered the truth and wanted to investigate, but had no clue, so she temporarily endured it, waiting for an opportunity. Unexpectedly, Cai Lianbi missed his lover and went to Ximen Road to look for her the day before. Yin Xushi found out and reported it to the police, who ordered Detective Wang Yantian to arrest Cai and bring him to the police station. Yesterday, he was sent to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special Court. The police lawyer Chen first explained the case, and said that the defendant had committed the crimes of Articles 257 and 240 of the Criminal Law, and asked for a postponement to supplement the arrest of his accomplice, Lu Zhengde, for joint investigation. Judge Li ordered the defendant to be remanded in custody for a continued hearing at a later date.</p>

<p>Red Pill King "Little Shandong" was previously arrested by the French police and released on bail by the Second Special Court and escaped. After an order was issued for his arrest, "Little Shandong" secretly sent his henchman Zhang Amao to sell red pills in the Ruifu Lane area. Last month, Zhang was arrested by the police and brought to court for trial. "Little Shandong" then ordered his henchman Zhang Ziying to set up a red pill distribution operation in a large cigarette shop at No. 31 Zilaihuo Street. The French police found out about this and went to arrest Zhang, as well as the shop manager Yuan Runzhi and apprentices Qi Jinsheng and Xu Yuefeng, and confiscated account books and brought them to the police station. Yesterday, they were sent to the Second Special Court. The police charged them with Article 6 of the Anti-Smoking Law.

<p>American Cotton and Wheat Arrives in Shanghai</p>
<h3 id="e164">China Merchants Bureau Obtains Storage Rights <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>Our country has purchased cotton and wheat from the United States. The first large batch of cotton can be loaded this month on the 15th and arrive in Shanghai on October 1st. This newspaper has already reported on this. Here is a follow-up report:</p>
<p>The cotton and wheat will be shipped to Shanghai in eighty ships, divided into batches. The cotton will be carried by ships chartered by the American merchant Fulai Foreign Company in this port, using forty ships to transport it in succession. The first batch of more than 7,000 bales will be loaded by the company's Aishan Aaron and will leave the United States on the 15th of this month. Because it has to stop at San Francisco, Japan, and other places, it will arrive in port around October 1st. The remaining 220,000 bales of American cotton will be loaded within three months, and most of it will be unloaded in Shanghai. The American wheat, totaling about 250,000 to 300,000 tons, will be carried by about forty ships chartered by the Norway-Weillmore Olsen Shipping Company and will also be delivered in Shanghai.</p>
<h3 id="e165">Central Government Not Responsible for Storage <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, a reporter learned from someone familiar with the cotton and wheat loan incident that the cotton and wheat purchased by the Central Government from the United States this time is different from the wheat obtained from the first loan, which was distributed by the Water Disaster Relief Committee. This time, when the cotton and wheat arrive in China, there will already be sales merchants responsible for the sale. The Central Government will absolutely not be responsible for storage and other responsibilities. After the cotton and wheat arrive in Shanghai, they will be handed over to the sales merchants in batches, and the designated storage location. The unloading process is completed. The merchants will handle the subsequent delivery of goods. The Ministry of Finance does not want to ask about it.</p>

<p>This time, the large quantities of cotton and wheat must all be unloaded in Shanghai. Each warehouse is vying for the right to store it. As a result, the China Merchants Steamship Bureau obtained the storage rights for the large quantity of cotton and wheat. The bureau believes that the ships carrying the cotton and wheat to China are at least 8,000 to 9,000 tons, and among the five docks in the bureau, the Huazhan Warehouse in Pudong is the most suitable, with the largest warehouse capacity and docks that can accommodate giant ships. After Liu Hongsheng contacted the Ministry of Finance's Cotton and Wheat Shipping Department about storage matters, an agreement has been reached. The bureau will provide two large docks for storage. The first batch to arrive will all be unloaded at the Huazhan dock.</p>
<h3 id="e167">Expediting Repairs to the Yangtze Warehouse for Use <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>Since the Yangtze Dock was taken over by the China Merchants Bureau, its advantages in terms of ship docking, unloading, cargo storage, and transportation are even better than those of the Huazhan Warehouse in the bureau. Taking advantage of the large number of American cotton and wheat arriving in Shanghai, the bureau decided to allocate funds for repairs in order to store the cotton and wheat. Yesterday, Liu Hongsheng proposed a resolution to the board of directors to allocate funds for the repair of the dock to receive and store the cotton and wheat. It is said that it has been approved. The original proposal is recorded below: Estimated cost of repairing the Yangtze Dock for public resolution. Proposed by Liu Hongsheng, Standing Director and General Manager. The Yangtze Dock has been taken over by the bureau, but it is in a state of disrepair. Whether it is rented out or used for the bureau's own business, it must be repaired before it can be used. It is estimated that the necessary repairs to the dock will cost approximately 47,000 yuan. After the project is completed, if the bureau operates it itself, it can undertake storage after American cotton and wheat arrive in China. Compared to the conditions of the Huazhan, the net profit can offset the repair cost in a little over a year. If the American cotton and wheat are actively shipped out, the net profit will be enough to offset the cost in half a year. Please make a public resolution.</p>

<p>Representatives of the Capital Side Request an Extension</p>
<p>Affecting the Entire Factory, Rendering Work Impossible</p>
<p>The labor slowdown in the leaf sorting section of the British-American Tobacco Company in Pudong continued yesterday without resolution. Mediation was originally scheduled for yesterday morning, but the representatives of the capital side suddenly requested a change. The labor unrest is about to expand, and other sections have been affected. Details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Continued Mediation Fails. The Social Bureau continued the mediation from the afternoon before yesterday at 10 a.m. yesterday. The representatives of the capital side, including Mr. Li De Ke (Director of the Personnel Department) and translator Chen Cangzhou, and the representatives of the labor side, including Chen Peide and Liu Dehua, were present, with Wang Gang of the Social Bureau presiding. However, the representatives of the capital side suddenly proposed to the chairman that they could not represent the factory at the mediation today and would submit a formal written statement explaining the reasons before attending again. Wang Gang immediately announced that the mediation would be temporarily suspended today.</p>
<p>Slowdown Affects the Entire Factory. The leaf sorting section continued its slowdown yesterday, and the entire section was shut down. By the afternoon, other sections such as gluing and box making were gradually reducing work due to the impact of the leaf sorting section shutdown. However, the factory's attitude turned tough. During the mediation the day before yesterday, the factory had agreed to reinstate worker No. 146, whose dismissal had triggered the slowdown, but refused to pay wages for the day of the slowdown, resulting in no resolution. Yesterday, the factory refused to mediate.</p>

<p>Municipal Social Bureau</p>
<p>Draft Rural Revitalization Plan (Continued)</p>
<p>1.  It is appropriate to alleviate the poverty of the countryside. Farmers rely on cultivating land, but due to various reasons, their income cannot meet their expenses, and it is difficult to maintain a family livelihood. Those who have income that can offset expenses often lack agricultural operating capital, such as the purchase of fertilizers and seeds, and the use of draught animals. They are unable to afford them, so even if they have good farmland, they cannot obtain good harvests. The more the harvest decreases, the poorer the farmers become. Therefore, it is appropriate to provide relief first. Upon investigation, the Municipal Social Bureau has held poverty relief loans and agricultural loans for the poor in this city. Not only have the poor in the city benefited, but also farmers in 11 areas in the four rural areas have been able to turn around with loans. However, the amount that one person can borrow from this loan is extremely small and cannot be lent to the fullest extent. To alleviate the poverty of farmers is like pouring a cup of water on a cartload of firewood, which is of no avail. It is hoped that the municipal government can raise huge amounts of money, strive to expand the loans, and provide farmers with as much loans as possible, so that agricultural finance can be circulated, and the poverty of the countryside can be medically treated. 2. Suppression of high-interest loans: Rural economy is difficult, and farmers lack funds, so they have to borrow from wealthy households. The wealthy households deliberately raise their interest rates and exploit them heavily. Because farmers want to solve their immediate needs, they have to accept it painfully. There are four types of rural high-interest loans: money high-interest loans, livestock high-interest loans, land high-interest loans, and goods high-interest loans. As a result of the rampant high-interest loans in rural areas, the self-cultivating farmers lose their land due to debt repayment and become tenant farmers. Tenant farmers are unable to rent land due to debt repayment, and they become hired farmers. They change again to unemployment, starvation and cold, and take risks, disrupt society, and destroy the countryside. Therefore, the country should strictly suppress high-interest loaners. If the legal maximum interest rate is exceeded, the law should be strictly enforced. At the same time, the government should set up financial institutions to make funds flow smoothly. In this way, rural life can be stabilized, and rural revitalization can be expected. 3. Protecting agricultural products and raising prices: Regarding this point, regarding the feast of the national rural economy, the municipal government should be asked to suggest to the national government to quickly implement protective tariffs and impose heavy agricultural tax rates on foreign countries. At the same time, it is recommended that all domestic transportation agencies reduce agricultural transportation costs and eliminate taxes so that all provinces and cities can sell each other smoothly and without obstruction. Then, tangible and intangible means are sufficient to increase the price of agricultural products and increase farmers' income. In addition, the exemption of common donations and miscellaneous taxes to reduce the burden on farmers, and the reduction of tenant rents to increase income, are all important ways to relieve the countryside.

<p>Lecture by Professor Zhang Qiyun of Central University</p>
<p>Recorded by Zi Tao</p>
<p>Lecture 3: National Defense Education in Primary and Secondary Schools</p>
<p>This lecture focuses on teaching methods, divided into four aspects: stories, models, drills, and village compacts. They are explained in order below.</p>
<p>(1) Stories: Primary and secondary schools are for children's education, while universities are for adult education. Teaching children should focus on concrete things that appeal to the senses, not abstract and profound theories. Children enjoy listening to stories or reading novels, finding them fascinating. Good novels always provide many examples and avoid being too abstruse, grouping similar things together and progressing gradually. However, within many concrete facts, there are still general principles that run through them. Therefore, national defense education in primary and secondary schools can use the story method to subtly influence students' basic concepts of national defense, achieving a natural and effective result. For example, when explaining the importance of tanks, it can be incorporated into the story of the Nenjiang Battle, which is included in the geography textbooks of the three northeastern provinces. Initially, General Ma Zhanshan used Nenjiang as the first line of defense and broke several sections of the Taonan-Ang'angxi railway bridge. Later, Japan negotiated with us on the grounds of creditor rights. The Japanese stated that the Japanese army would not take any military action other than protecting the repair of the bridge and demanded that our side withdraw fifteen li from the Jiangqiao Bridge. Our side, considering that the League of Nations General Assembly was scheduled to be held on November 16, did not worry about other matters and allowed them to repair the bridge. After the bridge was completed, Japanese tanks and heavy artillery crossed the river and suddenly attacked us. In addition, at this time, the soil in Northeast China was frozen, tight, and dry, which was very suitable for travel. Japanese tanks and heavy artillery galloped back and forth, making it impossible to resist. According to military experts, if China had tanks and airplanes in the Nenjiang Battle, the result would not have been like that. For example, when the history class discusses the European War, a passage from General Ludendorff of Germany can be inserted. He said, "If our army had adequate tanks for military use in 1918, things could have been different." He also said, "I deeply know the combat power of tanks, but the highest military authorities always turned a blind eye to it, which led to an irretrievable defeat." General Von Zwehl of Germany also said, "We were not defeated by General Foch's genius, but by tanks." The status of tanks on the battlefield can be seen in general here. It is difficult to determine which is more important, teaching materials or teaching methods. Some believe that teaching materials lose their inherent value when separated from teaching methods, while others believe that teaching methods can adapt to circumstances, but if there are no good teaching materials to enrich them, they will inevitably become empty. In short, neither can be neglected. Currently, most schools in our country use textbooks as teaching materials. How to choose national defense teaching materials requires a lot of research. In addition to textbooks, we must also compile various children's reading materials, using extremely simple and lively language to describe various facts about national defense, and adapt them to the level of students at all levels for extracurricular reading.</p>
<p>(2) Models: The models discussed here are in a broad sense, including handicrafts and drawings. Children often want to make things, so handicrafts must be included in the curriculum. All toys can be made by the students themselves to train their minds and talents. For example, what does a tank look like? It is a special type of car with an internal structure similar to that of a car. The outside of the car is covered with steel armor to avoid the danger of guns and bullets. The car itself is equipped with machine guns and artillery, making it a disguised armored car. The special feature is that the four wheels of the car are removed and replaced by two chain tracks, with each section of the hinge connected in sequence to form a chain. Therefore, the tank is also known as a chain car. The tank travels by means of chain tracks and can climb mountains and cross ridges without any obstacles, making it very formidable. Schools can find ways to make a model of this new type of weapon and then have students imitate it, so that students can observe it personally to satisfy their desire for knowledge. At the very least, photographs or drawings should be available so that students can get a clear impression. For example, regarding naval ports or fortress projects, the staggered arrangement of bamboo and wood layers can be used to roughly represent the scale and show the situation. This type of handwork can allow students to imagine the place, and its effect cannot be replaced by language and writing. Generally, good naval ports have strict gateways and are surrounded by overlapping mountains, making them easy to defend. Natural barriers protect them, and enemy ships cannot directly attack from the sea. Gun emplacements and docks are built inside and outside the port, so there is nothing to fear. Although naval ports are not important ports for merchant ships to enter and exit, they have transportation routes to the interior, making it easier to gather materials. The supply of food, fuel, and other supplies is more convenient. If the location is inconvenient for land transportation, the port's situation alone is not suitable. To explain the various conditions of a naval port, it is best to use a model of Qingdao Port to represent everything. Good achievements in drawings, handwork, and various airplane models and gas masks can be displayed in the school museum for people to visit, as an aid to imparting military knowledge. As the saying goes, "Seeing is believing." The use of movies as an educational tool can give students a deeper impression. For example, the naval action movie produced by the US military is very exquisite and can inspire the American people to value the navy. After watching this film, it is as if one is on the scene and suddenly understands. Filmmakers in our country should also learn from this idea and produce films related to national defense. Because they have educational value, military experts and educators should be consulted to make them perfect. For example, homework during holidays is a good opportunity to implement design teaching methods. Teachers set a goal and make a plan in advance and then have students execute it. Finally, they add criticism. The execution procedures can be divided into investigation, collection, travel, practice, lectures, and visits. In short, students should be allowed to be active on their own and gain solid knowledge from their own experiences.</p>
<p>(3) Drills: The examination system has recently been implemented. I think it is still possible to vigorously implement drills. Drills are a great tool for implementing national defense education, as evidenced by the Sokol movement in the Czech Republic. The Czech Republic is a rising country in continental Europe, and its people are full of vigor, vitality, and strong unity, which is especially praised. The Czech Republic was able to gain freedom because of the training of the Sokol movement. The Czech word "Sokol" means "eagle in the island," taking its agility. It was founded in 1862, and its purpose is to develop youth sports and build an independent spirit. Today, the Czech Republic has a population of 15 million, and the Sokol movement has more than 700,000 members. The arena is located outside Prague, the capital, and its equipment can accommodate 150,000 people. Its construction cost 1 million yuan, which was entirely raised by members. During the competition, 100,000 young men and women swarm into the arena, and its music is magnificent and its order is strict, which makes people feel infinitely emotional. Members living abroad, not to mention in Europe, even those far away in the Americas, travel thousands of miles to participate enthusiastically, willing to sacrifice time and money to uphold the glory of the country. Although this movement is a kind of competitive sport, its spiritual training is infinitely great. The so-called "lying on firewood and tasting gall" and "millions of people are of one mind" can eventually cultivate a healthy national character and break free from the shackles of Austria. Massaryk, the great man who founded the Czech Republic, was one of the members of the Sokol movement. The area of the Czech Republic is roughly equal to that of Hebei Province in China, and its population is less than half that of Hebei Province. If our country adopts the drill system, it can be based on the old prefectures or sub-prefectures as units, depending on the convenience of transportation. For example, in Switzerland in Europe, even the smallest village has shooting exercises and sports meets, and the form in which they are held is very solemn, and the competition is very fierce. This kind of spirit is worth emulating.</p>

<p>Problems Arise</p>

<p>American Lawn Tennis Association Investigating</p>
<p>因流言謂梵將成職業家</p>
<p>Due to Rumors that 梵 Will Become a Professional</p>
<p>(New York dispatch) Carl Seawright, chairman of the amateur rules committee of the American Lawn Tennis Association, announced today that the amateur status of American tennis champion 梵恩斯 is under review due to widespread rumors that he has dealings with the professional world. Upon hearing this news, 梵恩斯 said that this was a good thing, as it would clarify the rumors, but he only received a confirmed sum of remuneration.</p>
<p>Later, there was no further contact.</p>
<p>Recently, there have been rumors that 梵 plans to turn professional after the outdoor season and travel with Tilden. In fact, unofficial reports say 梵 has agreed to accept $100,000 for a nine-month professional contract, but this has never been confirmed. When asked, Oberlin, a key figure in the newly formed Oberlin Sports Promotion Company, admitted to negotiating with 梵恩斯. Oberlin also revealed that 梵 had requested $100,000 as a condition. Oberlin said that they were prepared to pay that amount, but 梵 must retain this year's U.S. Championship, otherwise the amount would be reduced.</p>
<p>It is generally believed that 梵 was about to turn professional last fall, but the compensation was not enough, so it did not happen. However, 梵 revealed that he would agree if the compensation was substantial enough. Tilden's behind-the-scenes power, last year offered a reward of $20,000, but 梵, having just defeated Cochem, was full of vigor and did not accept.</p>
<p>The actual net income of Tilden and Cochem's joint tour is about $210,000. The company owner earned $118,000. Ten matches in eleven days yielded this amount. If 梵 becomes a professional, his appeal would be a hundred times greater than Cochem's, and even if a price of $100,000 is paid, the surplus would be more than double that. (August 8)</p>

<p>Financial Standard Gold Continues to Decline Slightly by Seven Yuan</p>
<p>(Due to the Rising Prices of Silver, Stocks, and Commodities)</p>
<p>The gold market yesterday was affected by the British bank's near-term contraction, while the American bank's was extended, the British-American exchange rate contracted, while the American-British extended. The forward silver price on the Five Metals Exchange rose by varying amounts from 1 to 3%. Stocks rose by $3.22, American wheat rose by more than 2 points, American cotton rose by 27 points. Private telegrams rose by 3125. People's morale was therefore weary. The initial gross offer decreased by $423, then further decreased to $67, but still declined. After the opening, the market stabilized due to the bank's appetite for acceptance, with little fluctuation. The situation revolved, and the market continued to rise at noon. Later, the market showed a soft trend. Transactions and fluctuations were limited. The first telegram from Mumbai said not to move, and the situation seemed weak. The exchange market was just banks doing business with each other, and the market became boring. After the close, a telegram from Mumbai said it had fallen by an Anna, and it rose slightly. It was found that the market situation was stable all day, with no special changes. However, because the bank's appetite was healthier, the gold market was finally able to support it. Although there were two rumors in the pre-market, they had no impact on the gold market, as they were completely unrelated. The 烚赤 price was increased by $190, and the market was slightly more active. The market situation for the day is recorded below:</p>
<p>The morning opened at $841.80, a decrease of $9.40 from the previous close. Goods opened at $1.50.

Heng Yu even sold to $2, but Huabi and others still accepted October U.S. dollars at 75. Zhi Feng and Yong Fu Chang advanced to $4.50. After the official announcement of the listed price, the exchange market hardened slightly. It was difficult to buy November at 29 yuan. Dade Cheng, Zhi Feng, Yong Bing, Xing Yifeng, Yong Shen Kang were all solid, and decreased to $40. Mai Jia Li cleared November at 29 yuan. Later, Huabi cleared the same month at 9375, and pulled to outside $2. Fu Chang smoothly sold, and fell to 02 points. Heng Xing took advantage of the low price to enter and stabilize. Zhi Feng Yong, Heng Yu, and Hong Xing scrambled to buy, rising to $4.50. The banks all cleared November U.S. dollars at 9375. Sumitomo came out with October U.S. dollars at 75 and retreated slightly. Yuan Mao entered, and the momentum struggled. There was not much buying or selling at this time, and the situation was peaceful. Dade Cheng, Daxing, and Yong went on the market and made progress, boosting people's morale. Datong ate November U.S. dollars at 9375, Pangen cleared October U.S. dollars at 6875. Rumors seemed good, and rose to $6.30. Meifeng stopped November U.S. dollars at 875. Mitsui came out with October at 6875, falling by $1.30, but this price was difficult to obtain afterwards.

The goods were accepted, and Fuyu also entered, rising to $4.50. Ruikang went on the market and supplied, and retreated to $3.10. Finally, the goods were strongly lifted, and Zhaofeng Chang and retail investors also bought, returning to $4.90. The close was $844.20. After the close, Shanghai cleared November U.S. dollars at 875, and Mumbai also fell by one Anna. Goods entered, rising to $5.50. Goods were auctioned at $4.50. The highest price of the day was $846.40, and the lowest was $840, a difference of $6.40. The result was a decrease of $7 from the previous close.</p>
<p>The revealed price was $857 due to the HSBC's US dollar listing price increasing by 25 to 28 yuan, which makes the standard gold price $857. Based on the closing price, the price is about $13 higher than the previous closing price. The monthly registered price for this month is $851, and for September is $846.

<p>Yesterday's financial situation was slightly complicated by the exchange rate, with money changers receiving and remitting over 48 million, while the collection and settlement of foreign exchange loans remained low at just over 7.8 million. However, the collection and settlement by banks seemed better than the previous day, mainly due to busy international exchange inflows and outflows, as well as goods imports and exports, naturally leading to more fund inflows and outflows. Foreign banks collected and settled over 1.8 million in banknotes, over 2.34 million in foreign currency, over 5.1 million in various goods exchange pledges, and over 5.34 million in foreign currency. Special collections and settlements amounted to over 2.8 million.</p>

<p>Government Bond Swap Transactions Dominate</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market of the Chinese Stock Exchange was still chaotic, with ups and downs, and most of the transactions were swaps, with more short swaps. The various goods sold by No. 46 were gradually becoming scarce. The northern gang has slightly replenished, but the big short positions have not moved much, and most of them are still watching. The opening in the morning was inconsistent with the ups and downs of the various gangs. There were both long and short swaps. Only a small number of short-term financial products were sold on No. 46, and the rest have stopped selling. The northern gang bought in slightly, and the price was slightly better by one to three jiao. However, the unified salt tax was still without spirit, and it was down by five points or one jiao. The second round of short swaps was more common, and the prices were mostly close to being weak. The selling of No. 46 was rare. The results of the market price were slightly up by one to seven jiao. However, the unified salt tax was relatively weak, down by one or two jiao. The long-term contracts for Jiu Liu and Zheng Liu were also down by five points to one jiao. Although the trend was chaotic, the number of deposits has been huge, and in the near future, mutual infighting will be inevitable. The total number of transactions was 7,631,000 yuan, including 6,000 yuan in spot goods, 2,700,005 yuan in unified salt tax futures, 530,000 yuan in disarmament, 675,000 yuan in 19 tariffs, 1,585,000 yuan in 20 volumes and 20 tariffs, 800,000 yuan in gold shorts, and the rest were tens of thousands to over 300,000 yuan.</p>

<p>New York Stock Market Advances Strongly</p>
<p>New Fung Yang Company Report, Wednesday (9th) New York Stocks, due to speculation about the continued devaluation of gold dollars, presented an optimistic picture, advancing strongly, with a total of 2,560,000 shares traded throughout the day. A reversal is likely tomorrow. Wheat rose due to flour mill purchases and strong spot prices. General expectations are that tomorrow's government report will benefit the bulls, so the market is stable. US cotton also rose by twenty-five points, with speculators considering the government's report to be inevitably excessive, and at the same time, the shorts did not dare to sell short due to fears of inflation rumors. Spot prices in Texas were slightly soft. According to the Steel Age report, steel production is still at 58%, but due to labor disputes in the Pennsylvania area, increased candle prices, and disruptions caused by the National Recovery Act, it is gradually shaking.

<h3 id="e219">Investigation of the Woolen Fabric Industry · Feng <a href="#e219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>The market for woolen fabrics was dominated by Western clothing 30 to 40 years ago, and the volume of transactions was not significant. After the change of clothing styles in the first year of the Republic of China, although Western clothing was not fully adopted, the woolen fabric business grew rapidly. More and more people wore Western suits, and the market for woolen fabrics became increasingly prosperous, leading to the present situation. The silk and satin business has declined daily, and the number of woolen fabric stores has increased. The industry originally had two main groups: Western clothing and general woolen fabrics. The Western clothing group was mostly located in the Hongkou area of Shanghai, while the general woolen fabric stores were mostly located in the Qipan Street area. In the last three years, the sales of woolen fabrics have increased even more. In cities, towns, and villages, all silk and satin and foreign goods stores now sell woolen fabrics. Most of the larger ones have set up separate woolen fabric sections. There are approximately 1,600 woolen fabric and Western clothing stores in Shanghai, both large and small. There are over one hundred formal stores that exclusively sell woolen fabrics (excluding those with established brand names). Therefore, it has become necessary to have a formal trade association, which is the Shanghai Woolen Fabric Trade Association. The following is a list of 75 member stores after investigation:</p>

<h3 id="e220">Yarn and Cotton Yarn Market Report: Weak and Unstable <a href="#e220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market opened flat in the morning and declined in the afternoon, showing signs of instability. Due to stagnant real demand and widespread financial difficulties, purchasing power felt particularly weak. Rumors circulated in the market that the Sichuan group had approximately 30,000 bales in stock and purchased an additional 5,000 bales of inferior futures yarn today. As a result, Chinese yarn was significantly affected, and panic suddenly gripped the market. Generally speaking, the future outlook is not optimistic.</p>
<p>(Yarn prices fell by 300-400 copper coins) The pre-market opening for human label yarn was characterized by a slight increase in American cotton and short covering, resulting in a stable market. Small increases of 10, 20, and 30 copper coins were seen across various months. In the afternoon, news broke that the Sichuan group had absorbed a large quantity of futures yarn, creating a weak market. Prices fell by 40, 50, and 60 copper coins across various months. The total volume of transactions for the day was 29,000 bales. Sales included 1,300 bales from Mei Ji, 1,850 bales from Da Feng, 1,100 bales from Ren Feng, 1,700 bales from Sen Kang, and 750 bales from Yong Da. Purchases included 1,300 bales from Tong Ji, 1,200 bales from Da Ji, 1,450 bales from Li Chang, and 2,400 bales from Tong Xing.</p>
<p>1,200 bales from Xie Sheng. Closing prices are as follows:</p>
<p>Human Label Closing Prices, Gains/Losses, Outstanding Accounts November 1913 Down 250, 950</p>
<p>August 1842 Down 338,750 December 1922 532,950</p>

<p>October 1896 468,900 Total 271,750</p>
<p>(Spot sales only 300 bales) Spot yarn sales were quite sluggish. Daily purchases by various groups totaled only 300 bales. Prices fell by 500 copper coins. Purchases by various groups are as follows:</p>
<p>Guangdong 90 Shantou 45 Ningbo 5</p>

<h3 id="e221">Cotton Flowers: August Contracts Rise on Short Squeeze <a href="#e221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>The belief that August futures contracts for old cotton can be squeezed is still strong. Some unscrupulous individuals are rumored to be selling to Japanese factories at low prices. On the one hand, they are squeezing purchases at the exchange, leading to short covering and a unique rise in the market. However, distant new cotton is cheap due to the low price of agricultural products, with cotton being the only expensive one. This year, there has been an increase in planted acreage, and the new cotton crop is expected to be bountiful due to favorable weather conditions. The number of inland merchants selling short is increasing daily, while yarn prices are low and factory losses are significant. How can they afford high-priced raw materials? If the weather continues to be favorable, a price decline is inevitable when the new cotton crop enters the market.</p>
<p>(Distant month cotton contracts have short sellers) The pre-market opening for Zheng Biao cotton was characterized by flat sentiment, despite the rise in American cotton and the fall in the gold market. However, bullish parties purchased more contracts, causing the near-month contract to rise by 150 copper coins and the distant month contract to remain flat. In the afternoon, the near-month contract rose by another 250 copper coins, while the distant month contract fell by 100 copper coins. The total volume of transactions for the day was 77,400 dan. Sales included 2,400 dan from Yuan Xing Chang, 2,000 dan from Yi Feng, 2,100 dan from Chun Ji, 2,200 dan from Yu Kang, 2,500 dan from Chang Feng, and 2,500 dan from Xin Cheng. Purchases included 3,000 dan from Da Chang, 2,100 dan from Geng Feng, 3,200 dan from Wei He, 6,200 dan from Da Feng, 2,700 dan from Yuan De, and 2,100 dan from Yuan Da. Closing prices are as follows:</p>

<p>Yesterday, American cotton prices fluctuated, initially falling due to favorable weather and then rising due to spot merchants buying land. As a result, spot prices rose by 24 points, and futures prices rose by 24 to 27 points. Liverpool cotton spot prices fell by 16 points, and futures prices rose by 13 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices fell by 12 points.</p>
<p>The Bombay cotton market rose due to short covering by European exporters. As a result, Bengal fell by 3.5 rupees, Oomra fell by 7 rupees, and Broach fell by 5.25 rupees. The following is a record of telegrams (dated the 9th):</p>

<p>(Good Autumn Silkworm Crop in the Four Townships North of Hangzhou) This year's autumn silkworm crop in the four townships north of Hangzhou is as good as the spring crop. The silkworms have developed well after hatching. During the second molt, the silkworms experienced some changes due to the weather, but the losses were minimal thanks to the efforts of the instructors. The silkworms are now in their third molt, and their condition is good. Barring any unexpected changes, a bountiful autumn cocoon harvest is expected.</p>
<p>(Sharp Fall in Lyon and Shanghai Factories) The Lyon raw silk market has been stagnant for a long time, and silk prices have been declining. According to reliable sources from French merchants, white silk prices in Lyon fell sharply the day before yesterday. Grade A silk was priced at only 97.5 French francs per kilogram, which translates to a decrease of more than 10 Shanghai silver dollars.</p>
<p>Grade B silk was priced at only 77.5 French francs, which translates to a decrease of more than 20 Shanghai silver dollars.</p>
<p>(Artificial Silk Sales Not Weak) Yesterday, the Yangtze River group continued to purchase 30 boxes of August and September futures contracts for brands such as Pai Da, Flying Eagle, and Blue Golden Bell at the exchange, with prices ranging from 174.25 to 163.75 yuan net.</p>
<p>(Foreign Firm Silk Grades Tend to Stagnate) The summer vacation for New York silk thread factories is nearing its end, and the factories are preparing to resume operations. However, silk inventories are substantial, enough to meet demand for more than a month. In addition, speculators are actively selling their holdings, so silk sales show no signs of recovery. Merchants in Shanghai are eager to sell, but European firms continue to suppress prices, and market sentiment remains sluggish. Yesterday, only Da Chang and others purchased 20 bales of white silk, and Xin Fu and others purchased 20 bales of Sichuan yellow silk. Prices remain flat and weak.</p>
<h3 id="e224">Needle Eyebrows Rise, Precious Eyebrows Fall <a href="#e224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, in the local foreign tea market, major foreign firms such as Ying Zhuang, Xie He, Yi He, Tong Fu, and Bao Chang continued to buy needle eyebrow green tea from Wuyuan and Tunxi. The market was especially strong for teas with tender, thin strips, which sold out as soon as they arrived. Sales prices rose by 3 to 4 yuan. However, the foreign firms showed little interest in precious eyebrow green tea, and prices for teas from Shexian and Suian have fallen below 100 yuan, a decrease of 4 to 5 yuan compared to before. The market conditions for other items such as pearl tea and tribute hee tea remained unchanged.</p>
<h3 id="e225">Grain Merchants Sell Distant-Dated Flour Futures <a href="#e225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>丨The decline is very sharp: exceeding three points丨</p>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market continued its downward trend. Although foreign wheat prices rose by 700-800 copper coins in Chicago and 300-400 copper coins in Canada, market sentiment remained weak. Spot flour sales were slow, and inventories continued to grow. Moreover, there was no longer any support from outside buyers. Manufacturers, recognizing the difficulty of reversing the trend, had to gradually unload their stocks. Buyers, seeing the opportunity, also gradually liquidated their positions. Therefore, the selling pressure was difficult to overcome. The near-month contract's decline stabilized somewhat as manufacturers covered their short positions (the lowest point reached was 2.225 yuan). The distant-dated contracts, however, fell more sharply as manufacturers sold short. Looking ahead, if sales do not improve, further declines are inevitable. As a result, the current month fell by 1 point compared to the previous day, September fell by</p>
<p>2.25 points, October fell by 2.5 points, November fell by 3 points, December fell by 3.25 points, and January fell by 3 points.</p>
<h3 id="e226">No Way Out for Flour, Wheat Prices Steadily Decline <a href="#e226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, wheat futures showed a declining trend. Foreign wheat prices had risen, and sentiment had temporarily stabilized. However, customers with goods in inland areas gradually sold short, and the market remained well-stocked. Manufacturers felt there was no way out for flour and were extremely lukewarm about buying wheat. This pressure was the main reason why the market could not hold its ground. Moreover, while the rise in foreign wheat prices could be temporarily dismissed, the wheat must eventually be replaced with Chinese wheat. The steady decline in prices for each month is therefore not surprising. As a result, the current month fell by 4 points compared to the previous day, September and October fell by 5 points, November fell by 6 points, December fell by 5 points, and January fell by 300 copper coins. Spot wheat, due to the lack of demand from manufacturers, was only being traded on a commission basis.</p>
<h3 id="e227">Rice Market Without Much Fluctuation <a href="#e227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, there were over twenty rice sellers. Both wholesale and retail sales were sluggish, and the situation was quiet. Rice merchants only purchased 600-700 bags. The prices for thick japonica, thin indica, and Du Yangjian rice varieties remained stable due to infrequent shipments. The value of secondary rice varieties improved, and prices rose slightly. The market price of rice from the Changdongxin factory remained unchanged.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, there were sixteen or seventeen boats carrying rice from various rivers. Sales of various types of rice in the market remained sluggish. The prices of top-quality white japonica rice were high and stable, while medium and lower grades rose by 60-70 copper coins. Du Jian rice showed signs of weakness. Early thin indica and Yangbu white rice varieties were stable. The price of rice from the Bendongxin factory did not change much.</p>
<h3 id="e228">Sugar Market: Jian Bing Hao Raises Prices <a href="#e228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market remained stable. The association set the price of common grade 24 coarse grain white sugar at 20.93 yuan, a decrease of one copper coin from the previous day. Dutch Red KNG brand was priced at 16.4 yuan, and new goods at 16.55 yuan. Taikoo Sugar B brand remained at 21.2 yuan, CW brand rose by 5 copper coins to 21.1 yuan, and DY and HX brands remained at the previous prices. The prices of refined white sugar from Zhonghua, Guohua, and Zhenji remained unchanged. Chao Gang Da Long Hao offered 36 boxes of high-grade light green sugar, with prices up 11 yuan. The price of top-grade ice white sugar was set at 21.5 yuan, up half a yuan from before. Jian Gang offered 58 boxes of Taiyuan ice sugar at 17.8 yuan per unit, up 6 copper coins from before. Unified hand-made ice sugar was priced at 16.2 yuan, and Five Blessing Standard White Ice remained at 18 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e229">North-South Goods: 400+ Crates of Lan Zhu Branches Opened <a href="#e229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, over 400 crates of Lan Zhu branches were opened. Top-grade branches were priced at 33-34 yuan, with lower grades priced accordingly. The market for high-quality goods was stable, while lower-quality goods were weaker. High-quality Wu Ye branches were priced at 20 yuan, with lower grades priced accordingly. Jinshan branches have fallen recently, while flat branches have risen by about 3 yuan. High-quality goods were priced at around 67 yuan. Raw dried Jinshan branches were of extremely high quality, dry, and brightly colored, priced as high as 85 yuan.</p>

<p>Peanut oil: The recent market is weak because the supply is still coming in, but sales are not smooth and dealers are accumulating inventories. Soybean oil is also sluggish. The inventory is not very thick, but the Dalian market is weak and transportation is possible. Therefore, the supply will inevitably surge, so people's hearts are weak.</p>

<p>— Ye Shengtao</p>
<p>丨Regarding the National Language Textbook丨</p>
<p>Today, I saw Mr. Yu Min's criticism of my "Kaiming National Language Textbook," and I would like to reply as follows:</p>
<p>Mr. Yu Min said that I wrote "馬托車" (mǎ tuō chē), and that according to the "national pronunciation," "people from all over the country will not understand what this is." In fact, there are many nouns with similar situations, such as "方棚" (fāng péng, awning) and "德律風" (dé lǜ fēng, telephone). As long as a person has heard of them, they will understand what they are. Moreover, haven't the words "馬達" (mǎ dá, motor) been almost "established" already? The "馬" (mǎ) in "馬達" (mǎ dá) is the same as the "馬" (mǎ) in "馬托" (mǎ tuō). However, I am willing to accept Mr. Yu Min's criticism and change the "馬" (mǎ) to "摩" (mó) to make it closer to the original sound.</p>
<p>The second point pointed out by Mr. Yu Min is actually his "accidental oversight." My poem begins with: "牆上開朶小紅花 (qiáng shàng kāi duǒ xiǎo hóng huā, A small red flower blooms on the wall). 牆下蝸牛去看花 (qiáng xià wō niú qù kàn huā, A snail goes to see the flower under the wall)." It ends with: "無數花開朶朶紅 (wú shù huā kāi duǒ duǒ hóng, Countless flowers bloom, each red), 一齊笑臉歡迎他 (yī qí xiào liǎn huān yíng tā, All smiling faces welcome him)."</p>
<p>Mr. Yu Min then said: "According to the grammar and habits of vernacular Chinese, it seems that '開朶' (kāi duǒ) means '開着一朶' (kāi zhe yī duǒ, blooming a flower); why does the following sentence change to '無數花' (wú shù huā, countless flowers)?" In fact, there are two sentences above the last two sentences: "爬爬歇歇三天半 (pá pá xiē xiē sān tiān bàn, Climbing and resting for three and a half days), 纔到牆頂看到花 (cái dào qiáng dǐng kàn dào huā, Only then did I reach the top of the wall and see the flower)." At first, only one flower bloomed, but after three and a half days, the flowers on top of the wall bloomed all over: this is exactly what I intended. Unexpectedly, it was overlooked by Mr. Yu Min.</p>
<p>"The Poor Man and the Rich Man" is an old fable. Because it contains the meaning of "people should conquer nature to make a living, and should not take the fruits of other people's labor," I chose it as teaching material, in connection with the previous lesson "Wind and Water." Mr. Yu Min took another view, believing that a lesson should be added after it, saying that the poor man "really went to farm, plow the land, chisel rocks, and cut trees, but landlords and others jumped out from the air, asking him to pay rent and settle accounts with him. He was deceived again. When he went to ask the rich man again, the rich man would tell him: 'I am cultivating my own land, who told you that you don't have land, etc.!'” This idea is very good. My thoughts took the path mentioned earlier, so I did not take this path. However, if the teacher is good at using it, I think even if it is not supplemented, it will not lead the readers astray.</p>
<p>××××××</p>
<p>A few days ago, there was also an article by Mr. Wu Dingdi, which made some suggestions regarding my words "Regarding the acceptance of literary styles, I advocate compatibility and extensive collection, and each article must be a model of each style." Now I will reply as an aside:</p>
<p>By literary styles, I mean basic styles such as description, narration, explanation, and argument. When we use language to express our emotions and ideas, we cannot do without these styles. How can a national language textbook not include these styles? By literary styles, I also mean the styles of practical documents such as notes, letters, telegrams, advertisements, articles of association, and opinions.</p>
<p>These styles are used daily and are encountered anytime, anywhere. How can a national language textbook not show some models</p>
<p>? I said "compatibility and extensive collection" earlier, but I did not specifically explain what I meant by the two words literary style, which caused Mr. Wu's suspicion; now that he sees this section, Mr. Wu should be relieved.</p>
<h3 id="e232">A Lawsuit about a Transformation Text <a href="#e232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>— He Ru</p>
<p>Recently, there was a lawsuit about a transformation text in the literary world that ended inconclusively. This interesting story should be told.</p>
<p>The plaintiff in this lawsuit was Wu Shichang. The sixth issue of the fourth volume of *New Moon* published Mr. Wu's critique of Zheng Zhenduo's illustrated *History of Chinese Literature*, which contained many criticisms, especially of the section on the origin of transformation texts, which was the most severely attacked. Mr. Zheng said:</p>
<p>We do not know when the earliest transformation texts occurred, but they must have been before the Kaiyuan and Tianbao eras. (Page 589)</p>
<p>As more and more Buddhist scriptures were translated, our writers and scholars were influenced by this new style and would imitate it unconsciously. (Page 588)</p>
<p>These are Mr. Zheng's views on the time and cause of the origin of transformation texts. Mr. Wu, on the other hand, believed that transformation texts originated from the Buddhist practice of singing and guiding. What is singing and guiding? The tenth chapter of Hui Jiao's *Biographies of Eminent Monks* states:</p>
<p>The purpose of singing and guiding is to proclaim the principles of the Dharma and guide the hearts of the masses. In the past, when Buddhism was first introduced, people gathered to recite the names of the Buddhas and perform rituals according to the scriptures. In the middle of the night, when they were tired and needed enlightenment, they would invite a virtuous elder to ascend the seat and preach the Dharma, sometimes interspersing it with accounts of causes and conditions or citing analogies.</p>
<p>It also says:</p>
<p>If one's knowledge is not broad enough and one's research is not deep enough, and one lacks the ability to improvise, then one must follow the old texts. However, if the talent is not one's own and the work is not one's own creation, then the pronunciation will inevitably be flawed. Moreover, any errors in transmission and writing will be followed and proclaimed, leading to confusion and doubt.</p>
<p>Mr. Wu's idea is that Buddhist preaching led to the practice of singing and guiding when the audience was tired in the middle of the night and needed enlightenment; that transformation texts arose from the interspersing of accounts of causes and conditions and the citing of analogies during the singing and guiding. According to *Biographies of Eminent Monks*, Hui Yuan was the leader, who lived from 333 AD to 416 AD, so the origin of singing and guiding was in the middle of the fourth century, and the text of the singing and guiding was the transformation text.</p>
<p>The defendant, Mr. Zheng, also presented a defense in a letter to Mr. Ye Gongchao, published in the seventh issue of the fourth volume of *New Moon*. Regarding the time of the origin of transformation texts, Mr. Zheng still insisted on his original view, believing that most of the transformation texts we see now are manuscripts from the late Tang Dynasty, and the earliest manuscripts with verifiable dates of authorship do not predate the Kaiyuan and Tianbao eras. Regarding the theory that transformation texts originated from singing and guiding, Mr. Zheng denied it outright, believing that singing and guiding texts were sung after meals, while transformation texts were not lectured after meals but in the main hall of Buddhist temples, and were not an epilogue. He also cited examples such as Emperor Jianwen of Liang's singing and guiding text and Wang Sengru's singing and guiding vow text selected in the fifteenth volume of *Guang Hongming Ji* as evidence, believing that these were singing and guiding texts, and therefore concluding that transformation texts and singing and guiding texts were two different things. It is unknown whether Mr. Wu was convinced after reading this article. In my humble opinion, it seems unlikely. The singing and guiding texts cited by Mr. Zheng seem to be texts for making vows and paying homage to the Buddha at the beginning of singing and guiding, not the singing and guiding text itself. As for the singing and guiding text itself, which sometimes intersperses accounts of causes and conditions and cites analogies, Mr. Wu's interpretation of analogies as stories may not be wrong. Moreover, Hui Jiao said:</p>
<p>At that time, the guide would hold a brazier and speak with eloquence and intonation, with endless arguments and limitless words. Talking about impermanence would make hearts and bodies tremble, talking about hell would cause fear and tears, asking about past causes would be like seeing past karma, verifying present results would be like showing future retribution, talking about happiness would make emotions joyful, and narrating sorrow would cause tears and grief. Thus, the whole assembly would listen attentively, the whole hall would be saddened, five bodies would be prostrate on the mat, heads would be broken in supplication, each would snap their fingers, and everyone would chant the name of the Buddha.</p>
<p>Reading this, we can imagine what kind of talent and attitude the guide must possess, what kind of materials must be used for singing and guiding, and what kind of effect singing and guiding can have on the audience. Are the singing and guiding texts cited by Mr. Zheng of this kind? Can they be of this kind?</p>
<p>I have no prior knowledge of either Mr. Zheng or Mr. Wu, and I have no bias in my opinion. Even in this lawsuit about a transformation text, I do not dare to assume the position of judge, but only offer my humble opinion for experts to correct. As for Mr. Wu's attitude in writing, he seems to be trampling on others, going beyond the scope of discussing academic principles. Although what he said may not be without pertinent points, it is obscured by his impoliteness. It is no wonder that Mr. Zheng was unwilling to engage in a point-by-point response and to devote all his energy to a brilliant defense, resulting in this lawsuit ending inconclusively. It is easy but not easy to be a critic.</p>

<p>— Hu Chen</p>
<p>Third Grandpa patted the few dozen copper coins in his pocket and said loudly, "That's all that's left. The rest were taken away by those bastards!"</p>
<p>I just listened blankly, becoming interested in this old man who had fled from the neighboring village, and also feeling a little pity.</p>
<p>Third Grandpa slowly took a puff of his dry tobacco pipe, staring blankly at the white smoke that escaped from the corner of his mouth. After a while, he continued, "At first, they were just bandits, and we poor people weren't affected. Later, the soldiers came, using the name of chasing bandits as an excuse, and set a fire, even burning down our cowshed." He shook his head slightly, and finally sighed.</p>
<p>"On the evening of the eighth, everything was calm. The banditry of yesterday had also fallen behind the mountains with the sun. But in the middle of the night, we suddenly heard someone beating a gong and shouting 'robbers.' Later, we learned that it was the soldiers from the city who had come to suppress the bandits.</p>
<p>"The leader of the soldiers called himself a company commander. There were a total of twenty or thirty people, with more than ten guns. As soon as they arrived, they asked where the bandits had gone. When they heard that they had left yesterday, they settled down and stayed in the temple.</p>
<p>"The next morning, two people came and said that we had to send a load of rice every day and that each household had to donate half a dollar as military pay. He also said, 'This is your place, and we are protecting you, so this small obligation is something you should fulfill.' At that time, Shui Sheng interrupted with an irrelevant remark, and he was whipped a few times and tied up with hemp rope to the company headquarters. In the afternoon, all the soldiers came and said that they wanted to search for bandits in each house. They drove all the residents to the open ground, but they went inside and ransacked the houses. As a result, after the search, the more valuable things in the house went with them.</p>
<p>"Later, because they heard that there were bandits hiding in the village, they set fire to all the cowsheds, haystacks, empty houses, and so on.</p>
<p>"What's there to live for in our hometown? Planting a few acres of hard-earned land isn't even enough to pay the donations. He shook his head a few more times.</p>
<p>Looking at his wrinkled and withered face, I also shook my head. I couldn't help but think sadly: Where are the Chinese peasants going to make a living?</p>
<h3 id="e234">After Seeing "The Light of Motherhood" <a href="#e234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>— Autumn Wind</p>
<p>The long-awaited "The Light of Motherhood" has finally premiered at the Nanjing Grand Theater. I held high hopes for this film and rushed to the Nanjing Grand Theater, which was already packed, nearly sold out. This also proves that the gentlemen and ladies of Shanghai, like me, have high expectations for this film! Of course, there were also many who came without a specific purpose. After the newsreel, the main feature began. During the two hours of cinematic flow, it evoked my infinite sympathy and emotion.</p>
<p>Since the waves of love-supremacy and aestheticism spread to East Asia, many intellectual women who had just emerged from the darkness became intoxicated with aestheticism and sacrificed themselves under love-supremacy. Even now, it is unknown how many are still immersed in the maze of pursuing beauty! Love and beauty are only a corner of life and should not be allowed to dominate the entire life. "The Light of Motherhood" depicts a prisoner of aestheticism, a pitiful creature deluded by material pleasures. This tragic ending, thanks to the director's skill and the actors' efforts, can be said to be a rare gem among domestic films. Of course, it cannot be said that it is absolutely flawless, but I am not a film critic and dare not prattle. What I want to say here is a bit of sentiment after seeing "The Light of Motherhood."</p>
<p>The impression "The Light of Motherhood" gave me is: sadness and melancholy, and finding a way out in helplessness – divorce and starting a nursery.</p>
<p>The future is a world of storms. Either don't live in this world, or if you want to live in this world, how brave and strong should you be so as not to be enslaved by others? Indecision and blind longing are not paths to survival. I feel that the light in "The Light of Motherhood" is too weak. It only inspires us with tender maternal love and lacks courage and determination. Although in the end, the mother and daughter both escaped their caged family life to start a nursery, this can only be said to be a narrow path to survival found in desperation. Because the entire social organization is imperfect, relying on two or three poor people to initiate a nursery is actually very difficult. Therefore, the final ending of "The Light of Motherhood" makes us feel that they—the mother, daughter, and former father—are all purists, reclusive hermits, not warriors of the present world. They did not give us an inspiration of "strength."</p>

<p>"Such an amount is indeed their last hope, but I did not give them a reply on your behalf, and they also attached conditions."</p>
<p>"There are also attached conditions!" Bo Tang said with a slightly excited expression, "What else is there, Wenqing?"</p>
<p>"There are also payment conditions, Bo Tang," Wenqing said earnestly, "The payment does not need to be made in advance. When the case is truly solved, you only need to prepare a replacement, half in cash and half in promissory notes, and send them together to 'swap'!"</p>
<p>"You really put your heart into it," Bo Tang said with emotion, "I understand your thoughtful intentions. I will follow your instructions. As long as the old man doesn't suffer a loss!"</p>
<p>"This is what I should do. Moreover, if you can find the old man before three o'clock, you won't have to spend a single penny."</p>
<p>"That would be even better, but I still appreciate your concern! Please reply to them on my behalf according to the conditions now! Please reply to them on my behalf according to the conditions now! Wenqing, please take care of it. I: I:: : I will quickly raise the money!"</p>
<p>"Don't be discouraged, Bo Tang," Wenqing said, "Since things have reached this point, raising money is important, but finding the old man's news is even more important. I will also send some people to look for him, but I can only pay attention to the license plate number."</p>
<p>After Bo Tang watched Wenqing, with his stout body, squeeze into the car, he immediately looked for someone to get money. Alas! Half in cash, five thousand, half in promissory notes, also five thousand. Such an amount, at such a time, although there are sources to look for, it is certainly not something that can be settled in a few words within a few hours. Therefore, in the end, he found many bills and went out to raise money himself, leaving Zhiguang at home to manage everything.</p>
<p>Soon, the outside telephone calls came one after another. These were all friends and relatives who had received notices from people like Shujin and instead came to inquire about the news, which caused a new disturbance in Bo Tang's house and added a new problem. Until Shujin returned after searching outside in vain, Peiying asked him to sit in front of the telephone and take on the task of answering phone calls. Just as Shujin sat down, suddenly a person whose name was not very clear on the phone was looking for Bo Tang, saying, "Please be sure to come to dinner tonight." This kind of telephone call with an unclear source made them even more panicked. Some people thought that "the industry" might have had some changes regarding the case, and some people thought that outsiders might have received some news regarding the case. In short, it seemed that the matter was becoming more and more complicated. Even Zhiguang dared not make a hasty judgment.</p>

<h3 id="e236">Scenic Areas Leaking to Automobiles <a href="#e236" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c236" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">236</a></h3>
<p>— Zhan Lu</p>
<p>The people of Suzhou have different psychological feelings towards automobiles driving in the city. Some are cold, cold to below freezing point, and some are hot, hot to above boiling point. The cold say: "There is only one and a half roads in the city where automobiles can drive; it is impossible to turn around and get out of the limelight. There is no benefit, but there are many harms. In the future, when city tigers run rampant, many lives will inevitably be sacrificed! The city is very peaceful, don't look for trouble." The hot say: "City areas should have the need to drive automobiles. It is necessary to demolish the surrounding city walls in the short term and open up all streets. Automobiles are sacred, and there is absolutely no reason to stop them."</p>
<p>The cold and hot arguments must be reconciled for a while. The method of reconciliation is to first allow automobiles to pass through scenic areas and then extend to cities. In this way, the scenery of Suzhou can attract tourists from all directions. Although it cannot compare to Hangzhou's West Lake, it can at least be close to West Lake's shoulder. The West Lake scenery is the elder brother, and our Suzhou scenery is the second brother.</p>
<p>It is embarrassing to say, "Above is heaven, below is Suzhou and Hangzhou." The Hangzhou scenic area has automobiles, and the Suzhou scenic area does not have automobiles. Hangzhou is indeed heaven, and Suzhou is no longer heaven. Every spring and autumn, our Suzhou people go to visit the West Lake scenery in an endless stream. As for our famous Taihu Lake Stone Lake, East and West Dongting, Guangfu Xuanmu, how many distant tourists can there be throughout the year? Not to mention distant people, even the people in the city circle who have visited these scenic spots are also a minority. Alas! It is in vain to be considered heaven, falling behind step by step, causing rural bankruptcy and creating such a gloomy paradise!</p>
<p>Suppose that "Qiufu" and "Fuhu" two automobile roads were built from Huqiu to Guangfu and Guangfu to Shihhu. Then, Suzhou's famous attractions and scenic areas can all be connected. Driving automobiles on those two roads, the wide areas can certainly reduce the danger of city tigers gnawing at people. The convenient transportation for tourists from all directions can attract at least tens of thousands of foreign tourists a year. People in nearby rural areas can engage in peddling and selling products. With more livelihoods, they can certainly revitalize the countryside, turning desolate areas into lively areas. All unemployed people can also make a living from it, without becoming bandits. It is truly called "one action and many benefits."</p>
<p>If you only add to the existing things in the city circle, let all the scenery be buried, and let all the rural areas decline. If all the wealthy people from the four surrounding towns gather in the city to sit in automobiles, eat big dishes, and watch movies, this is not a good phenomenon.</p>
<h3 id="e237">At the Movie Theater <a href="#e237" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c237" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">237</a></h3>
<p>— Ren Peichu</p>
<p>On Saturday night, I turned into the rooftop garden. I first strolled around each venue and felt that the Beijing Opera venue was too noisy, the storytelling venue was too quiet, the Qunfanghui was not to my taste, and I didn't understand the Dagudiao tune. I found the stairs, turned up, turned up, and turned into the open-air movie theater. This day, it was showing: Charlie Chaplin, Rock, Laurel and Hardy's "Comedy Mashup." Although they were all old films, I hadn't seen them, so I sat down.</p>
<p>The first film was Rock's "Scolding Neighbors." I laughed until my stomach hurt. Unfortunately, it was too short and ended in a moment. After it ended and was about to connect to the second film, the screen suddenly showed "Beware of Pickpockets." I touched my pocket and looked around. Just in that look, a beauty seemed to follow my gaze and came over and sat next to me. I looked at her in the faint light reflected from the screen and couldn't help but secretly comment, "Beautiful, fashionable, and sensual."</p>
<p>But I hadn't had a chance to make a move before she greeted me with a smile. Embarrassed, I quickly shifted my gaze to the screen: Charlie Chaplin was being slapped by a fat woman. Before I could react, she blew a thick puff of cigarette smoke out of her mouth and onto my face. Fortunately, I am also a veteran smoker, so of course I didn't need to dodge. Moreover, it was coming from the mouth of a beauty!</p>
<h3 id="e238">Eating with an Open Mouth <a href="#e238" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c238" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">238</a></h3>
<p>— A-Jie</p>
<p>The human body is not solid, so it has to eat and poop. Pooping doesn't require "art" and "method." This is a natural talent for people. There is no need to talk about it, just "urgently" poop. Only eating requires "art" and "method," not as easy as pooping. You see the deification of eating art and the wonder of methods in the world, which can prove that eating is not an easy task! For example, officials eat by bragging and flattering; shop assistants eat by jumping and leaping all day long, bragging about themselves; teachers eat by relying on a mouth in addition to chalk; friends who sing opera, sing civilized opera, and tell stories, of course, can't eat without a mouth. Except for rickshaw pullers who eat with their legs and prostitutes who eat with ×××, 90% rely on their mouths. Therefore, singing new operas and telling stories are commonly called "eating with an open mouth." In fact, most people in the world "eat with an open mouth," especially teachers.</p>
<p>In the past, how dignified were teachers? Heaven, earth, ruler, parents, and teacher sat in the fifth chair. Therefore, teachers received honorable titles such as "old master," "private tutor," and "master" without feeling ashamed. Today, whether they are university professors, lecturers, or teachers, a few gilded "Doctores" are accepted without shame. In fact, they are all "eating with an open mouth." What is so rare about it? In the common view, a gilded "Doctor" also holds a few teaching positions in universities and middle schools, carrying a briefcase, scurrying around all day long. He "barks" at X University, hurriedly runs to Y University, and "barks" again, then runs away. Often, the "lecture notes" become tattered, and the words in the book become so familiar that they flow out. However, the students' progress is small, but the teachers' progress is much greater. Isn't this very much like the masterpiece of "eating with an open mouth," with many performances?</p>
<p>At the same time, I got an invention. That is: "The tool for eating is the mouth, so the tool for eating is also the mouth." Why? Please do a statistic: Aren't those who are good at eating in the world all good at talking? Saying human words to humans, ghost words to ghosts, flattering words to those who are higher than me, boasting words to those who are lower than me, thickening the face, lifting the lips, drumming the long tongue, opening the talk box, with varying degrees of emphasis and intonation, subtly and forcibly, quickly and slowly, fluently and clumsily. The more artful the mouth, the greater the amount of food. Just look at the people who shake up in society, you might as well close your "conscience" but you can't close your "mouth." Isn't that a clear proof?</p>
<p>Those who do not understand "the art of life" are not the same. They are very clear in their hearts, but they do not speak out. People see him as a dumb, and they can't hear your honeyed flattery or your bragging skills, so they are unfathomable, and it is difficult to ask for advice. Alas! In the world, there is only "eating with an open mouth," and there is no "eating with a closed mouth." If you want to eat, quickly open your mouth!</p>
<p>I was pinched on the thigh, although it hurt, but I understood that this was a kind of flirting action!</p>
<p>She opened her mouth to me, asking me to sit in her house. This is a beauty favoring me! She stood up, seemingly anxiously waiting for me, but I, who did not appreciate the gesture, was still sitting still. She urged me several times and finally sat down again.</p>
<p>The surrounding electric lights shone brightly, and I realized that the movie was over. There was a burst of chaos between the seats. I disappeared into the chaotic crowd.</p>

<p>Zhao Ziqiang said, "I've also thought about it. There are two ways out. One is to be a surgeon, and the other is to do business." Guan Yaowu was still standing, looking at him, and said, "Old brother, are you crazy? How can you say such a thing?" After speaking, he sat down. Zhao Ziqiang didn't say anything and took a sip of his wine. Guan Yaowu said, "Old brother, we've been soldiers all the way to now. We've been through a lot and changed three hundred and sixty bones. If you say there's some good thing that lasts forever, it's okay to give this up to do it. But it seems like you yourself are confident. I don't know whether it's being a doctor or being a shopkeeper. If you want to be a surgeon, you have to be a bit of a showman. We can't speak that way to people. And without someone to introduce and support you, you might not even be able to hang up the sign. Being a doctor is not like conscripting soldiers. You can't conscript people who aren't sick to come and see you. If people who are sick don't trust you, you can't conscript them to come and see you either. I have a friend who is very knowledgeable in medicine. He hung up a sign, got a certificate, and rented a house. He made a lot of noise. He waited at home for three months, and no patients came to his door. And he was an internist, not to mention a surgeon. If you say you want to do business, what kind of business do you want to do? No matter what kind of business, you always have to put up capital first. I want to ask you, how much capital can you put up?" These words left Zhao Ziqiang speechless. He drank his wine and ate his food, and after a long time, he responded, "Everyone has their own views." Guan Yaowu said, "How does everyone have their own views?" Zhao Ziqiang said, "For example, you have a wife and children, but you can't even go back for a whole day throughout the year. You have a home but it's like having no home:::" When Guan Yaowu heard him say this, he couldn't help but laugh out loud. He said, "I thought you had suffered some great shock and had to give up your gun! From the looks of it now, you're doing it to marry a wife." Zhao Ziqiang picked up his wine glass and took another sip, and then laughed, "It's not quite like that." (155)</p>

<h3 id="e241">A Stream of Soothing <a href="#e241" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c241" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">241</a></h3>
<p>— Ms. Dingxiang</p>
<p>Closing the book and thinking quietly, the sorrows of the past and the discontented resentment float on my brow. I, on behalf of my sister who stood in the dark corner and wept, let out a stream of soothing.</p>
<p>Wasn’t it last year’s Lantern Festival when the child was born? As I came back from the cinema and walked through the courtyard, there was a courtyard of moonlight and swaying bamboo shadows. At this time, a few cries of a child came from upstairs. Oh! Concubine An gave birth. I went upstairs thinking.</p>
<p>Concubine An was wearing a sleeping cap, with a pillow under her head, her face pale, her eyes closed, lying on the bed. Gu Ma was sitting next to her with dull eyes. Where is the child? Wrapped in a cotton coat that Concubine An had worn before, lying at her mother's feet, crying hard with her eyes closed!</p>
<p>I said, "Concubine An! This is sinful. Whether the child is a boy or a girl, it is always your own. Today is the Lantern Festival, and a girl born on the Lantern Festival has a good life! Don't look down on her, let her warm up next to your body! Poor little life!" Gu Ma persuaded in a low voice. Concubine An still shook her head, and large tears fell from her eyes.</p>
<p>This child was really unfortunate. Concubine An eagerly hoped to have a son, so as to raise her status. But it happened to be a girl, which gave Concubine An a fatal blow. The child cried sadly! It seemed to understand her own life experience. Oh! Who is to blame? Blame this inherited society, right? The mother also sobbed on the pillow, as if sympathizing with the child, and saddened for herself.</p>
<p>The next morning, when I went to school, I didn't hear any crying. When I came back from school, I put down my schoolbag and looked for the child. In the corner of the house, on the floor, lay this unfortunate and sacrificed child.</p>
<p>This child was like a small flower on the green grass, quietly blooming in the spring breeze, and withering lonely in the spring breeze. No one knew, leaving only a stream of soothing.</p>
<h3 id="e242">In the Darkness <a href="#e242" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c242" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">242</a></h3>
<p>— Li Pengxiang</p>
<p>The farmer Li Xiaomao sat on the threshold of his thatched hut in the darkness, feeling dazed. He hated his wife for being too good at having children: this was already the sixth.</p>
<p>"What's the point of raising children in this kind of year? The output of the land is so worthless, more than two yuan for a load of barley. What will you give him to eat—drink northwest wind?"</p>
<p>As he thought angrily to himself, his son A-Da had already run out to tell his father that his mother had given birth to a younger sister.</p>
<p>So he followed his son into the room, where Granny Yin next door was bathing the newborn child in a footbath. The woman was groaning on the bed, and no one was taking care of her.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Li Xiaomao stiffened, took a few steps, pushed Granny Yin aside with one hand, and ran out with the footbath. The child was crying weakly inside, rolling around, but he didn't care at all. He put the footbath outside the room and went mindlessly to the stove to grab a bamboo basket of ashes, filling it to the brim. He took this back to the original place, gritted his teeth, lifted the bamboo basket, aimed it at the child's mouth and nose, and poured it in relentlessly. In a moment, there was no sound at all.</p>
<p>Granny Yin, who had been following him silently, was stunned. She looked at him inexplicably. Li Xiaomao's frightening expression scared her into immobility.</p>
<p>"What's wrong?"</p>
<p>She couldn't help but ask.</p>
<p>But he didn't answer, as if he hadn't heard. He poured the little thing into that bamboo basket. It didn't move at all, like a dead cat. So he took the bamboo basket, lit a lantern, carried the two things in both hands, ran out of the house, and walked away in the darkness along the narrow field path. Faintly, he could hear the barking of dogs in the village.</p>

<p>"A bald daughter, her mother always says she's good!" This is an unbreakable iron law. Human beings tend to have this common disease: being critical of others and forgiving of themselves, seeing the bad things in others but not reflecting on their own mistakes.</p>
<p>Of the maids in the mouths of wives, nine out of ten are bad. For example, if the young mistress loses her Western doll or the husband's silk scarf is clearly abandoned at the dance floor, the disaster star is sure to be blamed on the maid. It's as if they saw it, saying that she stole it to sell it for melon. They won't think about their own people, let alone investigate.</p>
<p>Even in the children's brawl dramas that often take place in the alleys, the adults on both sides always come forward and make a big scene. Some do scold their own children a few times, or even beat their own children to vent their anger, "It's your own fault. I told you not to mix with them!" This tone is clearly further blaming the other party.</p>
<p>Capitalists and factory directors only know that workers are complete bad eggs. Seeing that in this era of "intensified unemployment terror," it is not enough to have work. They want to improve their treatment. When petitions have no results, they encourage labor unrest, strikes, and sabotage. If the factory is closed, what way out do you have? They don't think about the factory's difficulties at all. Therefore, absolutely, capitalists will not realize that their exploitation is wrong.</p>
<p>They indulge in their own waywardness, visiting prostitutes and playing with women. But as soon as they see their wife or concubine chatting with the kitchen administrator next door, they immediately put on a serious face: "You filthy ×× be more careful, don't blame me for being ruthless!" At this time, of course, they won't remember their own lascivious behavior.</p>
<p>When a few friends get together, they talk at length, and everyone points out the faults of others, and they are eloquent, and they are never seen to confess their own bad habits.</p>
<p>The general intellectuals play this tactic even more, as if the more knowledge they grow, the cleaner they protect themselves.</p>
<p>Old scholars can point out the shortcomings of young people in a coherent way and say that vernacular writing is as ordinary as speaking. However, they cannot find that they have become a wart in the "evolution" process. The articles they write are not only not in line with the facts, but also grammatically incorrect, making people dizzy at first sight.</p>
<p>There are even more writers, as the saying goes: "One's own wife is always uglier than others', but one's own articles are always better than others'." They specialize in settling accounts with others, and they are afraid of not being able to praise themselves to the sky, to be immortal. Just open a magazine and look, there are always several such writers and articles.</p>
<p>The general young compatriots are even more loyal models of blaming others and forgiving themselves. For example, when it comes to life, they have already squeezed into the middle class and are constantly rushing and falling into dance halls, movie theaters, ice rooms, cafes, and food stores. Yet they keep shouting for themselves, blaming society and others, without thinking at all that those who are scraping for a living on the streets are also people and are also surviving.</p>
<p>Such behavior is indeed a flaw in human beings, so I want to shout loudly: "Report yourself!"</p>

<p>Now it is summer again.</p>
<p>Summer, after a separation of three seasons, has returned, and I feel joy. Among the four seasons, I love summer the most. Summer is grand, summer is solemn, summer is natural, and summer is full of poetic sentiment. It is when summer arrives that the lonely world is adorned with liveliness; it is when summer arrives that the cold society is imbued with vitality. Summer exposes the beauty of nature, and summer dissipates the coldness of the human world. The bright and beautiful spring is the season for young masters and misses to talk about love, which is not for us. The clear and refreshing autumn day is the perfect time for famous literati and elegant scholars to discuss romance and the moon, which is also not for us. As for the cold winter, we, who have had our fill of the coldness of the human world, are indeed very ordinary. It is only summer that can give us a universally and appropriately enjoyable experience of the characteristics of the season, so I love summer.</p>
<p>Now that summer has arrived, I am happy.</p>
<p>How lovely are the softly buzzing mosquitoes that appear in summer! They are constantly by people's sides, morning and night, singing. Is the young master Ji's lover's pearly throat so melodious? Is the Prince Wang's "darling's" affection so lingering? Every day when I return to my room from work, they immediately fly to my side in groups, intimately. When I take off my sweaty shirt to bathe, they rush to help me suck up the sweat; when I collapse wearily on the canvas cot to rest, they come to sing by my ear, sometimes burrowing into my arms, sometimes crawling on my arms and neck. The innocent mosquitoes sometimes tickle me, and I often jump up from the tickling. Only then do they giggle and buzz away. I was born with an irritable temper. When I get tired of playing with them, I often hit them. The cunning ones among them, of course, fly away buzzing as if they are pretending to be cute. The weak ones are often slapped to death by me. Alas, these good singers and dancers cannot withstand the swat of my giant palm, and they all turn into beautiful blood-like red stains. These red stains decorate my white summer cloth mosquito net. The scattered remnants of red are truly a beautiful and delicate painting!</p>
<p>I love that mosquito girl who is both a painter and a poet. I love summer even more. I wish that mosquito girl would always be by my side. I wish summer would last forever in the human world.</p>
<p>Let those dignitaries, wealthy gentry, and rich tycoons stay forever on Mogan Mountain, which "has no summer." Let us enjoy the greatness, solemnity, and beauty of this summer as long and fully as possible.</p>

<p>— Jian Xun</p>
<p>Cars sped down Jing'an Temple Road like arrows, the neat rows forming a gray line, silently and windingly advancing toward their magnet—"Vienna"—in the rustling rhythm of wheels on asphalt.</p>
<p>On the ruins of the Dahua Hotel, a soul-stirring kingdom has been built here. The brilliance of the "Yearly Red Lights" interweaves into a rainbow-like net, trapping "Vienna" and also trapping the longing of passersby outside "Vienna."</p>
<p>The aroma of beer and Luzon cigars fills the entire space. The gray-black bamboo fence marked "Vienna Common Garden Dance Hall" surrounds countless gentlemen and women in circles.</p>
<p>Here: there are fields and fields of the wealthy, that irregular area of golf; filled with tempting colors and patterns; red, green, square, slanted.</p>
<p>In the dance hall, pairs of young men and women dance embracing, smoothly gliding in fox trots on the glossy floor. The huge brass loudspeaker shines with golden light, illuminating everyone who is intoxicated in the light-green haze.</p>
<p>Jazz music plays intermittently, and the light melody of "Fan O Ling" is as beautiful as moonlight.</p>
<p>Here: one cannot hear the wailing of the 30 million compatriots in the Northeast under the iron heel of the imperial army, nor can one hear the sobbing of the hundreds of millions of hungry people scattered in our vast and rich land. Here, one only hears gold and flesh playing a magnificent symphony.</p>
<p>People all over the world, listen: Who says China is extremely backward in material things, and Chinese people are all coolies? Look! Isn't this place crowded with countless noble men and women enjoying all modern material comforts?</p>

<h3 id="e246">A Scene of Degeneracy <a href="#e246" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c246" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">246</a></h3>
<p>— Xian</p>
<p>Afternoon, a summer as long as a year.</p>
<p>Miss Three woke up from her afternoon nap. The electric fan on the desk covered her cloud-like beautiful hair over her face. Seeming languid and weak, she pushed her hair to her ears, stretched out her hands, straightened her snake-like slender waist, and with a pair of eyes turning under her long, slender eyebrows, she drowsily recalled a sweet dream. Suddenly, as if remembering something, she called her maid, A Cui.</p>
<p>A Cui did not expect that Miss Three would wake up so early. She was flirting and joking in the garage. The young lady's call was so low. Looking at the bedroom door, and still not seeing A Cui coming in, she jumped up from the leather sofa, blew on herself in front of the electric fan for a while, and slowly strolled to the dressing mirror. The face powder on her face had been condensed into a film by the sweat. "A Cui," she shouted loudly.</p>
<p>A Cui was called from the garage by Cai Ma, who said that the young lady was angry upstairs. Thinking that the young lady had discovered her secret, she went upstairs with a heavy heart. Miss Three was really impatient. "Where did you die? Quickly bring two bottles of soda!"</p>
<p>A Cui took the soda and went back upstairs. Miss Three was lying on the sofa again, holding a cigarette and thinking about something in a daze. A Cui poured a full glass of soda and placed it on the small tea table without paying attention. A Cui had no choice but to stand there blankly. For a while, the room was as lonely as a late autumn morning, with two hearts pondering two different things.</p>
<p>The cigarette burned Miss Three's pointed fingers. Turning her head, she saw A Cui standing there blankly.</p>
<p>"What are you standing there for!"</p>
<p>"Miss, the soda."</p>
<p>"I know, go run the bathwater!"</p>
<p>"Miss is taking a bath?"</p>
<p>"If not taking a bath, what else would I be doing!" Miss Three was always loud and bossy today.</p>
<p>She raised the glass and took a sip of the soda. "Icy," she muttered as she went to the bathroom.</p>
<p>She took off her silk pajamas, and a charming young girl's body was exposed in the mirror. Miss Three jumped into the bathtub as if she was being peeped at. She again thought of that sweet dream, "A Cui," she called.</p>
<p>A Cui turned the door knob. She did not come in because the door was not locked. She smiled and said through the door, her voice not as loud and bossy as before:</p>
<p>"Go downstairs and listen for the phone, A Cui, don't let Madam hear!"</p>
<p>A Cui smiled at her own guilty conscience. How would the young lady know her secret? Thinking about the unexpected extra money, her steps were much lighter when she went downstairs.</p>
<p>When A Cui came upstairs again, Miss Three had finished putting on makeup, with her right leg crossed over her left, sitting peacefully on the sofa, but her heart was not so calm, which could be seen from her rolling eyes.</p>
<p>A Cui leaned over to Miss Three's ear and whispered for a while. Miss Three only smiled and nodded, stood up, looked at her body in front and behind in the mirror, and walked away as if doing a fox trot.</p>
<p>Seeming disappointed, A Cui rushed to the door and said to the young lady, "Do you need a car?"</p>
<p>Miss Three gave her a meaningful look, took a banknote from her handbag, and handed it to her, "A Cui, if Madam wakes up, say that Miss Six asked me to play mahjong again, and I'm going to see a movie tonight, so there's no need to send a car to pick me up!" Miss Three shouted deliberately loudly.</p>
<p>"Understood, Miss," A Cui's tone also became louder.</p>
<p>Shop Employee Correspondence</p>
<h3 id="e247">A Female Worker's Production Tribulation <a href="#e247" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c247" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">247</a></h3>
<p>Editor:</p>
<p>I am an ordinary shop employee. I have already benefited quite a bit from your column's teachings. I feel very puzzled by not seeing any correspondence in the Shop Employee Correspondence column for several days. Your column is probably not stopping like the Readers' Consultant, is it? I have another matter to trouble you with. Please take the time to answer it.</p>
<p>I am married, my parents are both alive, and I have four younger brothers who are all unmarried. The youngest is only fourteen years old and still studying. The rest are employed, but their income is very meager. My father is fifty years old and still in good spirits. He runs a small shop in the countryside, barely making a living. In the past, when the market in Shanghai was prosperous, my income was still good, and I was responsible for a considerable portion of the household expenses, which I could still maintain. Since the war in Shanghai, the economy has been sluggish, and rural areas have gone bankrupt one after another. Prices are falling day by day. Our store has suffered a lot. Especially since our store specializes in wholesale to other places, business has plummeted. Fortunately, our boss has managed things properly, so the overall situation has not been affected. However, we employees have always relied on the year-end bonus from the store's profits. Now that the hope of a bonus is gone, and we have no savings, we cannot maintain the original situation. Therefore, last year, I ordered my wife to come to Shanghai to work in a factory. Although the income is meager, it is still a small supplement. Unexpectedly, my wife is about to give birth, and there will inevitably be another expense at that time. Moreover, she will not be able to go to work in the factory after giving birth. Therefore, after thinking about it again and again, there is no safe solution. I have always admired your enthusiasm for teaching, so I dare to bother you with this letter. I hope you will not refuse. I humbly ask you to write back. With best wishes, Pan Min, sincerely (August 3rd)</p>
<p>×××××</p>
<p>Editor's Note: Since this column was launched last year, it has been praised by people from all walks of life. I dare not spare any effort to help my dear shop employees in any way possible. A few days ago, due to important matters in the editor's family, it was difficult to explain hastily, and no one was asked to fill in, so it was interrupted for more than a week. I am very sorry to have troubled readers with inquiries. In the future, it will continue as before.</p>
<p>In these difficult times, "fewer people producing and more people eating" is definitely not going to work. The fact that your wife is working in a factory is very much in line with the times. Don't be misled by the terrible word "face" and worry about it. In our opinion, your family can really boast, "There is no one eating idle rice." Except for the youngest brother who is not yet an adult, everyone can support themselves. Even your parents, who are over fifty years old, are still struggling to make a living. On your part, you can already be said to be "doing your best," but the result is still inevitable panic. This is the evil result of the social economy and uneven distribution. This is also the result of someone exploiting in the middle.</p>
<p>Your wife will soon give birth. Temporary expenses and subsequent impacts put you under economic pressure everywhere. When a group of neither old nor new people hear about it, they will inevitably complain to you, saying that you are overestimating your abilities and why didn't you adopt the method of "birth control." In the editor's opinion, their words are absolutely wrong. Look, any kind of animal in the world can live and reproduce leisurely. Is it possible that humans, who are the spirit of all things, can only live a hard life after years of hard work, and even the God-given desire to procreate must be forcibly suppressed? Moreover, broadly speaking, the people of China are poor. Then, can we advocate national "birth control" to cut ourselves off from humanity? We believe that our way out is to unite the exploited and attack the exploiters, reclaiming our due rights. For example, regarding the issue of female workers' childbirth, we can demand that the factory pay wages before and after childbirth. We sell our entire lives to capitalists. Anything we need for life cannot be dismissed as out of line.</p>
<p>The above method is a fundamental solution, and it cannot be achieved in a short time. Mr. Pan may inevitably dismiss it as "high-sounding." A passive method is to seek help from charitable organizations (such as civilian maternity hospitals) when labor begins. After childbirth, you may as well send your child to someone else to raise. We don't necessarily have to raise our own children ourselves; it is enough to be satisfied with the "desire to procreate" if my child lives in this world.</p>

<p>▲Grateful thanks to Mr. Lu Shouyan, Acupuncturist Mr. Lu Shouyan is the son of Mr. Li Peiqing of Jiading Acupuncture. He has inherited the family's knowledge and completely conveyed the wonderful secrets. With divine acupuncture and moxibustion, he brings spring with his hands. I suffered from pain in my right arm two years ago, and my four young children's right fingers also felt stiff. All were cured by the doctor's acupuncture treatment. The method of acupuncture and moxibustion is the oldest way to treat diseases, and there are few researchers now, all because patients are always afraid of pain and dare not try it. The doctor's acupuncture method focuses on conditioning, so the needles are thin and short, and he knows the acupoints and meridians. The patient does not feel any pain at all, so those who seek treatment fill the courtyard. The doctor lives west of the Xiaocai Market in Baxianqiao. Sincerely, Zhang Shutong.</p>

<p>— Xi Lin</p>
<p>(27) This is a Sign of China's Revival</p>
<p>When Shi Qiao was standing on the street corner, holding the letter and stunned with excitement, he suddenly heard the sound of firecrackers from far to near, gradually as if the sound of firecrackers ignited. Like a fuse, the whole city immediately responded. At first, he wanted to inquire about the reason for the firecrackers with a kind of war-time terrifying psychology, but before he could ask, he saw a large group of people in front, holding up the national flag, rushing up like a tide, and the sound roared:</p>
<p>'Long live the Republic of China, long live the great Chinese victory!'</p>
<p>'Then the shouts from all around surrounded them!'</p>
<p>'Shirakawa is dead, General ××× has arrived in Shanghai!'</p>
<p>'Recover Zhenru, capture Zhabei!'</p>
<p>Everywhere was a mixture of cheers and firecrackers, resounding through the heavens and the earth. Children, women, and old men all ran to the road. Everyone came out happily. Everyone forgot to close their doors, but no one would go in to steal. At this time, as long as they were Chinese compatriots, everyone was especially kind and more upright. Women stood by the roadside and waved their handkerchiefs to the crowds shouting slogans. Children scurried between the legs of adults, and if they were knocked down, they would get up and walk away without cursing at anyone. The old man stroked his beard, smiling and touching the head of his grandson. He was sixty or seventy years old and had never seen such a happy and encouraging grand occasion. Shi Qiao only seemed to have split his mouth with laughter, but he still couldn't close it. He asked about the news along the way, how Ishikawa died, and when General ××× arrived. Everyone was willing to answer him loudly, partly because the shouting on the road was noisy and could not be heard unless they spoke loudly. Some told him that Ishikawa was stabbed to death by our soldiers with random guns, some said he was killed by artillery fire, and some said he was assassinated by a Chinese female warrior when the enemy held a celebration. This female warrior was a graduate student from the Imperial University of Japan who spoke Japanese. She disguised herself as a Japanese dancer, mixed into the celebration, and threw a bomb at Ishikawa, killing him. It was also said that General ××× led the strategic army in a battle that defeated the enemy in an unknown way. Zhenru has been recovered, and in the battle of Liuhe, thousands of enemy troops were killed, three airplanes and six cannons were seized, and countless spoils of war were obtained. When Shi Qiao walked to Avenue Joffre, the excitement there was even more spectacular. The shops on both sides, whether they were Chinese goods stores, cigarette and paper stores, fruit stores, silk and satin stores, pharmacies, foreign goods stores, department stores: : : : All the electric lights were turned on as much as possible, dazzlingly shining, and all were hung with national flags. Looking at a row, they formed a red and blue oblique line, neatly and strangely beautiful. The shop assistants stood at the door, competing to set off firecrackers, crackling and popping, thousands of sounds and harmonies, red flames blooming everywhere. Even more, many people threw firecrackers down from upstairs or hung them up with long bamboo poles to set them off. The crowds walking below scattered for a while and then gathered again with laughter. The smell of gunpowder permeated. The trams in the middle of the road were crowded with people, and the tram windows were full of heads, waving and shouting. In the blink of an eye, another tram of people came by, shaking and shouting. They even sang the national anthem, and the people on the roadside responded. The cars coming and going were like schools of fish, forming groups and speeding by. All the cars of Shanghai's car dealerships must have been rented out. Every car had a national flag, and some even had naked men standing on the roof, making heroic gestures and shouting to kill ×××. The muscles of their whole bodies revealed a powerful outline. That kind of healthy and beautiful posture obliquely symbolized the powerful Chinese nation. Inside the carriages, they were beating gongs and drums with all their might. Many children took the opportunity to climb on the sides of the cars and cling to them, or climbed on the rear wheels behind the cars. Some fell down and climbed onto the second car. Teams of people walking were also beating gongs and drums. The national flag was in the front and back. Look! The anger of a nation that has been oppressed for so long, the melancholy of a century that has been lurking for so long, has erupted in a roaring, roaring voice from the depths of the earth!</p>

<h3 id="e250">History of German Cultural Films (Part 2) <a href="#e250" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c250" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">250</a></h3>
<p>— Hou Feng</p>
<p>The "Film Bureau" has the following two methods of rewarding generally excellent films: First, it is stipulated that films must be deemed suitable for educational purposes by the "Film Bureau" before they can be screened in schools. Second, films with standard value may be screened in ordinary cinemas, and their entertainment tax will be reduced or exempted. The German film viewing tax is generally stipulated at 15% of the ticket price. However, films that have passed the inspection of the Film Bureau can receive preferential treatment and obtain reductions or exemptions.</p>
<p>The personnel of the "Review Board," namely the "Film Bureau," are mostly government officials, and its content includes representatives from the Ministry of Culture, the Ministry of Agriculture, and the Ministry of Health. Its main financial resources come partly from the collection of film review fees, and partly from the income of issuing permits. At the same time, the association also has the establishment of an inquiry office to answer the questions of general manufacturers, distributors, and powerful people in the private sector regarding art films, educational films, cultural films, and other issues. Although the association cannot produce or distribute films itself, it has established methods for guiding filmmakers in order to correct the evils of bias, and it also examines scripts in advance before films are produced. At the same time, it strives to make teachers and school administrators understand the value of cultural films so that they can lead students to appreciate excellent films. Therefore, it also published a teaching syllabus and implemented a film technology training institute for teachers, and the classification of educational films. The so-called German Film Association is responsible for managing the rental or sale of films and projectors to member schools. It has many branches within Germany. At the same time, it maintains a close relationship with the Central Film Bureau. The total number of schools in Germany is about 80,000, and the number of schools that actually implement film education is more than 20,000. As mentioned above, the German cultural film policy can be said to be not far from the road to success, but in reality, it is not optimistic. Waludenru·Jiedenru said this in his "Dead German Educational Films": "The German economic depression is too profound. Although the German teachers' joining the school film alliance has an economic foundation as its background, it cannot be denied that they are driven by a desire for fame. Some school teachers are still cursing their encouragement of their families to help the school's games, harming their children: : : :. At the same time, we can observe from the theoretical standpoint of the foundation of educational films that, in order to achieve the purpose of continuous activities, various methods and stages should be studied first. However, the current Germany does not even have the smallest amount of 'gold,' so the school can only use the donations from the 'Parents' Association' as the cost of screening films. On the police side, however, there is a great power to list prohibitive regulations. They check what kind of permits there are, what the entrances and exits are, what the indoor lighting is like, and how the projector should be positioned. Therefore, teachers cannot but avoid it for their own comfort. : : :"</p>
<p>The entire history of German cultural films and educational films is a process full of hardships and difficulties. It is a chronicle full of blood and filth. However, since Hitler seized power this year in March, rumors have spread that the National Socialist Party is already manufacturing political propaganda films. And German cultural films have also encountered a major historical shift. (End)</p>
<p>Film Commentary</p>
<h3 id="e251">Review of "The Mysterious Beauty" <a href="#e251" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c251" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">251</a></h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>The Girl in 419</p>
<p>Jameson is a star who finds it difficult to earn money, which is probably not a problem. Therefore, producers never miss such a good opportunity; as long as it is at all possible, Jameson always has to star in various new films. Regarding his work, we probably won't forget "Good Luck" which he starred in with Sally Shou Luan. In this film, we can see that he is indeed very good at comedy performances, and has a unique flavor. As for films like "Considerate," they are ultimately unremarkable and lack any characteristics, although they are not offensive.</p>
<p>In these works, we can clearly find his artistic characteristics; almost every one of his works is the same: the characters he plays are often optimistic and frivolous young people. Of course, the content of individual films varies somewhat, but the characters he portrays are almost cast from the same mold. As mentioned earlier, the director of "Good Luck" cleverly grasped his characteristics, allowing him to give full play to his abilities under the conditions of a funny sailor. As for the authors of the latter, such as "Considerate," although they wrote the script for him, he could not succeed in more serious dramas.</p>
<p>"The Mysterious Beauty" belongs to the latter category. He is just singing his old tune, and it can't be said to be a success; at best, it is passable. So here we can see that using stars to attract audiences is indeed the ultimate method for film entrepreneurs, but the achievements of stars do not necessarily fully satisfy people.</p>
<p>As for the entire play, the director's ability here is only to present a monotonous story with a slight twist. However, the confusion of scenes and the fragmentation of editing make each scene tell the plot, rather than acting well. This disjointed combination of short shots certainly cannot grab the audience's attention and make the play a success.</p>
<p>However, the main failure is still the tastelessness of the story. Writing scripts for stars is already a very tasteless thing, let alone turning tricks within the same content. The story tells of a doctor who, after falling in love with a nurse, accidentally falls in love with a female patient from a bandit gang. As usual, talented scholars and beautiful women must become a couple. Thus, this doctor from the police hospital abuses his power for personal gain to acquit the girl living in room 419. He even shows favoritism to the bandit because of this. In the end, a method of retribution is used, causing the bandit to die at the hands of another doctor, which reveals the ridiculousness of anarchy. Perhaps some people will say that this is their own exposure. However, this is also a naive view, because advanced artists will never engage in such seemingly right but actually wrong nonsense.</p>
<p>Audience Opinions</p>
<h3 id="e252">Talking About The Radiance of Motherhood <a href="#e252" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c252" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">252</a></h3>
<p>— Ni Qiu</p>
<p>Consciously, this is a work that depicts people in general who are devoted to art for money. It satirizes women's vanity and the so-called artists' desire for money, which can be described as incisive.</p>
<p>The actors in this film are all very hardworking. Chen Yanyan plays a girl who has been baptized by vanity, and her attitude is very natural. Li Zhuozhuo's style has become very good, but unfortunately she lacks opportunities in the first half of the film, and her performance is inevitably repetitive. She is very good at showing the suffering of a mother in her heart regarding Xiaomei's behavior. When she hears Jiahu describe the situation of hard labor, the inner compassion she displays is completely realized. Duo Yan's style in this film is very similar to Novarro's performance in Ben Hur. The revolutionary enthusiasm fills his entire body, and the paternal love hidden behind when he meets Xiaomei is also very sincere.</p>
<p>The other supporting actors are also suitable for their roles. The interweaving of Liu Jiqun, Han Langen, and Yin Cenxi's actions, such as clapping, taking off hats, and throwing flower baskets, are all very novel.</p>
<p>The director's efforts are even more evident in this film. Several shots, such as Mr. Zou holding back tears as he bids farewell to Xiaomei and leaves, taking out a handkerchief at the exit, and the scene of Liu, Han, and Yin reading the newspaper, and when the mother boards the ship to go abroad to see her daughter, only the father is seeing her off at the dock, are all very capable of leaving a deep impression on the audience.</p>
<p>The subtitles in this film are indeed a great enhancement to the film. For example, when Ji Mei asks Mr. Zou whether he has made a fortune in Nanyang and returned, Mr. Zou's answer reveals the global economic downturn, as well as the status and oppression of overseas Chinese today, which is indeed very meaningful.</p>
<p>Other aspects, such as the sound of the last song being well recorded, and the photography being better than "New Year's Eve," show that Huang Shaofen's skills have indeed made significant progress.</p>
<h3 id="e253">Impressions After Watching "The Radiance of Motherhood" <a href="#e253" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c253" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">253</a></h3>
<p>— Luo Ping</p>
<p>In such a morbid society, under economic pressure, it is a very common fact for a woman who has lost her husband to remarry someone else with her children.</p>
<p>Of course, the reason for this remarriage is not necessarily for vanity and enjoyment, but for her own survival and for the survival of her children. If Huiying remarried for enjoyment and vanity, then she could have abandoned her child. From this, we can see the unique love of motherhood.</p>
<p>Huiying's heart is permanently tied to Xiaomei. However, her daughter, influenced by her father's education, and seduced by material things and vanity, insists on marrying a wealthy man as his wife, and cannot comprehend the mother's heartfelt love at all. But when she is ill in Nanyang, her mother specifically finds a way to get money and goes to Nanyang alone to see her. This can also show the great love unique to motherhood.</p>
<p>In real society, the "love" between men and women is considered sacred and inviolable on the lips of some people, and their life in the words of some people. However, in reality, women are only treated as toys by playboys. Huang Shulin's abandonment of Xiaomei is an inevitable phenomenon under this social system. Therefore, after Xiaomei exposes the mask of the wealthy and gives birth to a son, she will truly realize who is sacred, great, and affectionate in the love between men and women and the nature of motherhood. Therefore, "The Radiance of Motherhood" is not only not feudal preaching, but also clearly explains everything in this society.</p>
<h3 id="e254">Talking About "The Radiance of Motherhood" <a href="#e254" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c254" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">254</a></h3>
<p>— Xiang</p>
<p>Regarding the actors in "The Radiance of Motherhood," Chen Yanyan, who plays Xiaomei, shows surprising progress in her performance. Every move and gesture is suitable for the character in the play, and she has achieved considerable success. Li Zhuozhuo, who plays Xiaomei's mother, has changed her style, and although some parts are too rigid, it is still good. Jin Yan's performance as Jiahu is also very profound, but Lu Shi's performance as Ji Mei is too contrived. He Feiguang, Li Junpan, and Ying, etc., are also good. On the whole, the actors can still fit the personality and identity of the characters in the play.</p>
<p>In terms of plot, although the record Xiaomei sings is well-known, I don't think even old men and maids would follow the music and dance. This is too excessive and unrealistic a depiction!</p>
<p>The maids in Huang Shulin's residence in Nanyang seem to not be dressed like maids in Shanghai. I think this is also a very minor flaw.</p>
<p>In terms of photography, the light is not soft enough in some places, but there are also several shots that are very satisfactory.</p>
<p>Other aspects, such as the humorous interludes of Liu Jiqun, Han Langen, and Yin Xiucen, the performance of Xiaomei's daughter Lian Jiang, from a lively and lovely young child, the innocent and unrestrained nature of the children in the nursery, and the beautiful little bird singing "The Radiance of Motherhood" at the end, can all add to the brilliance of this film.</p>
<p>In short, this film reveals the greatness of maternal love and can truly be called a rare domestic film.</p>

<p>— Ma Teng</p>
<p>He thought, why reject people from a thousand miles away? It wouldn't hurt to lend a helping hand. So he agreed to have an in-depth conversation with Yi Fan. Later, Hedges became very interested in recommending her to Eiston or Seymour Bossamore.</p>
<p>At this moment, a blonde girl suddenly walked in. She was very arrogant, and the many people sitting outside the office were not in her eyes. She came in and went straight inside. Yi Fan, while asking "Who is this?", assessed her and felt that this woman was arrogant and frivolous. The woman walked past Hedges, and Hedges stood up respectfully and bowed to her, but she just nodded as if she didn't care. Eiston's assistant, Mr. Seymour, came out himself to greet the woman and took her inside. Yi Fan asked Hedges again, as if impatiently, who that woman was and whether she could act. Hedges told her, "That's Rita Vernon. Of course, she can act." But Hedges' tone was cold. He also said, "She has a talent for performance, but she's also too lucky. Her future is very bright, but it's a pity that she's too arrogant and indulgent."</p>
<p>In the inner room of the office, the habitually arrogant Rita Vernon was issuing orders to Eiston; and the writer Sheridan, knowing that he had deep disagreements with Rita Vernon, was hiding in the bathroom next to the office. He didn't want Rita Vernon to join his play, but for Eiston's sake, he couldn't firmly oppose it. And Eiston didn't admire Rita Vernon that much either, but felt that she still had some appeal. The play "Blue Sky," which is now being rehearsed, has to let Rita Vernon play the lead role. But Sheridan always hoped to find a suitable lead role in his recent translation of Mona's "The Golden Bough," so that he could become famous in one fell swoop. He could let Rita Vernon play the lead role in "Blue Sky," but when "The Golden Bough" was rehearsed in the future, he absolutely could not give in again.</p>
<p>But this was just Sheridan's wishful thinking. He hadn't heard Rita Vernon giving Eiston the following ultimatum yet. The condition she put forward to Eiston was: she would now accept the lead role in "Blue Sky," but after "Blue Sky" ended, she should choose which play to rehearse next and which role to play herself. Eiston had no choice but to agree to her. He thought that "Blue Sky" would take a lot of time to rehearse. When it came time to rehearse "The Golden Bough" later, he would think of other ways. He sent the protagonist away and sighed deeply.</p>
<p>Rita Vernon went out, and Eiston hurriedly asked Sheridan to come out; but as soon as Sheridan's foot stepped out of the bathroom door, Rita came back in, putting Sheridan in a dilemma and making him very embarrassed. (To be continued)</p>
