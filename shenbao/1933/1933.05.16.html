<p>— 元</p>
<p>事急矣。日軍國主義顯然的將總攻平津矣。我國仍將如從前熱河諸役之不戰而退耶。或曰熱河諸役。未嘗不戰也。抵抗之劇烈。砲火之凶猛。將士死傷之鉅大。日見於報紙。烏得謂之不戰。然而彼進而此退。甲攻而乙不援以少數無計劃無聯絡之師。禦整個統一指揮裕如之敵。其戰也等於不戰其敗而退也。等於不戰而退。今之知識階級要人名流。皆認此種抗戰爲無意義之犧牲誠哉我國人亦共認其爲無意義也。然而有意義之犧牲將若何。則又囁嚅而應之曰。此一方案實在難開。嗚呼。時勢至此。病重至於九分九將因無特别有效之藥方而仍以此無意義之舊藥進。以聊盡人事耶。抑幷靳此無意義之犧牲而坐以待斃耶。</p>
<p>夫中國今日之病。非眞無有效之藥方也。今日知識階級要人名流所謂「此方案難開」者。亦非眞無方案也。有方案而不敢開耳。以我人料之所謂有效之方案有二。一則用溫和疏通之藥。冀以挽救目前暫時之危險。然而病根不去。仍有旦夕復發之虞。二則用猛烈攻瀉之藥。目前雖若危險暫時雖甚苦痛。然而病勢一轉。宿疾即瘳。從而滋補調養。原氣不難恢復不過前者雖若有連效。然究近於敷衍搪塞。恐病家反對。故一般知識階級要人名流。雖認其爲有意義而不敢開。後者則以危險太甚。恐病人不能忍受此苦痛。更不敢認其爲有意義。而貿然開此藥方。除此兩方案以外。實無其他神奇不可思議之妙藥。故此種少數人無計劃無聯絡之抗戰。雖明知其爲無意義之犧牲。然而究較不服藥而坐視其死者心可稍安。且可以尙在服藥之名。搪塞親戚故舊之責備。是以祇得認此無意義之犧牲爲抵抗强敵之唯一方法也。</p>
<p>然而事勢至急。豈尙有我人從容觀望之餘暇乎。無論如何棘手。總須確定一「有意義而多數同情」之藥方。欲得一有意義而多數同情之藥方。須將各醫所開之藥方。孰爲相宜。孰爲不相宜。公司討論。是否可用溫和疏通之藥。抑必須用猛烈攻瀉之藥。澈底考慮。自能得適當之方針。溫和疏通之藥。雖似有急效。而實甚危險。猛烈攻瀉之藥。雖似甚危險。而實有良效。在此病勢危殆急不能緩之際。主持醫藥者。自當廣集名醫之意見。權衡利害。速定一確實有效之良方。以挽救此九死一生之險象。倘若有有效之良方。不敢貿然嘗試。而仍用所謂「無意義犧牲」之舊方。明知其無效而姑爲是頭痛救頭之計。則誠無異於諱疾忌醫。將來平津之亡。眞所謂無意義之犧牲矣。</p>
<p>我國人旣知以前熱河諸役之抗日爲無意義。則今日亟應一致奮起爲有意義之抗日。盡我有意義犧牲之力以救平津質言之。除全國一致動員以抗戰外。又安有其他有意義之藥方哉。</p>

<p>五月十一日在青年會講</p>
<p>講到九一八，應該先講日本的對華政策。但是日本對華政策這題目前幾天蔡孑民先生已經講過了，我在這裏不多說了。</p>
<p>日本在明治維新以前，是一個封建的國家。明治維新時，從封建的體制轉向到資本主義的體制，從閉關時代轉向到帝國主義的擴張政策。日本在先進帝國主義的壓迫之下，形成了他的資本主義國家。</p>
<p>一八五三年，美國艦隊敲破了日本的門戶。日本的統治者不願把自己的國家淪爲列强的殖民地，就追從列强趕上資本主義的路上去。但是日本是個島國，資本主義一般的工業建設，在日本都有缺乏原料的困難。因此日本的統治者在明治初年確定了向外發展的二個政策丨一個是向南侵略的海洋政策，另一個就是北進的大陸政策。朝鮮就在大陸政策之下亡了，亡了以後便輪到我們的東北。日本侵略東北並不自九一八的時候起，而是遠在幾十年以前。從甲午的日清戰爭後，就衝破了我國東北的藩籬；日俄戰爭以後，更扼住了我國東北的生死線。幾十年來日本帝國主義者對於東北政治上經濟上的侵略，已種下了根深蒂固的勢力，使東北的山漒於無形中變了顔色！</p>
<p>我們現在講到九一八的事變，便應該知道日本爲什麽要發動九一八。發動九一八的動機第一是：日本帝國主義者自己是一個島國，他爲了要發展他資本主義的工業，原料的需要就很感迫切，這使他養成了掠奪殖民地的野心。近幾年來，整個世界的經濟恐慌，當然日本不能例外，受不景氣的影響，社會上星現種種不安的狀態；日本的統治者爲了要消滅國内社會上不安的現象，在另一方面又爲了要準備第二次的世界大戰，更需要原料的供給，與銷貨的市塲，所以他必須武力佔領我們的東北！第二是：日本帝國主義要防止美國的經濟力量侵入我國。日本資本的力量堂然不及美國資本的力量。他要阻止美國資本的力量深入我國，這就是帝國主義國家間的互相衝突。第三個是：日本帝國主義者看見蘇聯的五年計劃快要成功了，尤其是西伯利亞工業社會化有成功的趨勢，使日本感覺到不安。第四是：中國政治上的不安，更加之前年夏季水災的重大。第五便是東北軍閥的腐敗，具備了這五個原因，日本帝國主義者以爲在這時候攫奪東北是一個極好的機會，於是就在前年九月十八日的晚上十時發動了滔天的慘劇！</p>
<p>我們又應知道九一八以前的情形：前年七月一日的萬寳山事件，日本警察帮同了朝鮮農民搶奪中國農民的土地，中國農民不服就起來反抗，日本警察就開槍射擊中國農民。七月三日到八日，日本更有計劃的唆使鮮人作仇華的暴動，死了我國在朝鮮的僑民一百四十二人，傷了五百四十六人，財産損失到四百多萬日金。同時又藉口中村丨丨一個軍人，改了裝到東北的内地做偵探丨丨的失踪，做了發動九一八瀋陽事變的藉口！</p>
<p>九一八以後吉林黑龍江錦州也隨之被武力佔據了去；十一月八日和二十六日兩次天津事變；去年一二八上海事變：去年三月一日滿洲僞國成立；去年十二月八日日軍無端啟釁砲擊山海關，今年的一月一日又第二次的攻擊榆關，一月三日的下午榆關又失去了；二月二十五日以後進攻熱河，到三月三日熱河又失去了！</p>
<p>這是九一八以後幾件最大的事情。我們總還記得很清楚，所以不再詳細講了。</p>
<p>我們現在所得的感想：</p>
<p>第一是當九一八事變發生的時候張學良發明了極端無恥的不抵抗主義！張學良不能認識九一八事變的原因，九一八以後他曾經對人表示，說日本侵略東北是日本少數野心家的行動，不能代表日本整個的政策，所以他的主張便錯誤了。</p>
<p>我們知道亡國後的印度的甘地，他還作非武力的抵抗。張學良是個軍人却主張不抵抗。我們如果問張學良那時候要是國内别的軍人開兵到東北去，他會不會起來抵抗，我想他一定抵抗的！不但他不願人家搶他的地盤，就是他私人的東西也不願任意給人家拿去的。可是他臨走的時候還要帶去幾千萬現金，和借閱北平頤和園的古畫。這是九一八後一個痛心的感想</p>
<p>第二個感想是：所謂的「長期抵抗」。從不抵抗到長期抵抗，那裏有一點成績做出來。所謂「長期抵抗」實在是毫無準備而且没有整個計劃！這種長期抵抗是等於不抵抗！我們知道，錦州，是没有抵抗失掉的；榆關，是没有抵抗失掉的；熱河，也是没有抵抗失掉的。一二八的第十九路軍第五軍和東北的馬占山蘇炳文以及東北義勇軍，都是没有整個計劃的抵抗，都被日本各個擊破了。</p>
<p>我們還記得，甲午的日清戰爭過後，當時廣東的地方政府要求日本放還被俘虜去的軍艦，向日本軍事當局說：我們和這次戰爭是没有參加的，請他們放還廣東的軍艦。這件事給外人批評說日本不是同中國戰爭，而是同滿清政府戰爭：日本不是同滿清政府戰爭，而是同李鴻章一人戰爭！馬占山蘇炳文十九路軍東北義勇軍的抵抗，還不是日本同馬占山個人！同蘇炳文個人！日本同十九路軍一部分的軍隊戰爭罷！（未完）</p>

<p>— 玄</p>
<p>本月十日的報上有兒童書局的告白，聲明有人以「新兒童書局」的名義「影戤侵害法益」云云。這件事的法律解釋，非本文所要置喙，我們要注意的就是書業中人對兒童讀物的推銷也是競爭得非常厲害。</p>
<p>營業競爭的結果，理應是出品改良，然而我們往往只看見影戤，只看見粗製濫造。三十年前中國的兒童讀物僅只有「無貓國」等數册，現在除了專門出版兒童讀物有書局外，大大小小的書店都印行大批的兒童讀物，在「量」的一方面說，不爲不進步，但是「質」的一方面能夠呌人滿意麽？從前僅有「大姆指」「無貓國」等等童話的時候，倒還没有「連環圖畫小說」，因此那少數的童話倒是「獨佔」的；現在兒童讀物的數量多上幾千倍，却反不能防止「連環圖畫小說」的無孔不入，在這點上，新書業以及兒童讀物的作者應該痛自反省！</p>
<p>現在程度不等的兒童讀物光量也有一萬種罷，而「連環圖畫小說」至多不過百數十種，可是後者流通之廣，吸引力之大，遠非前者所能及；這種現象是可怕的。現在的兒童讀物，十之九是文藝性的；約可分爲三類：一是貓哥哥狗弟弟的簡單故事，或譯或著或取中國民間故事稍加改換；讀者對象是七八歲的兒童。二是較爲複雜的了，但題材大部分還是屬於第一類，偶有歷史傳說和神話。三是西洋文學名著的譯本，例如寳島之類。依這分類，我們就知道第一第二類雖有繁簡之别而並無本質上的差異，第三類則突然跳高，特别在文字上；如果第一二類適合於八歲乃至十歲的兒童，則第三類是適合於十四五歲的初中一二年生，因而十二三歲的兒童便簡直無書可讀。我以爲這是「連環圖畫小說」風魔了高小五六年生的原因之一。</p>
<p>其次，上述第一二類的讀物數量雖多，而質料却很單薄；不論是西洋故事或本國故事，同是那麽一點來滬，大家採用，結果就成爲内容雷同。所以卽使是七八歲的孩子也感到讀物的缺乏。「抄來抄去的幾隻故事啊！」七八歲的孩子對於新書不滿意了。於是他也學他哥哥的樣：看起「連環圖畫小說」來了。</p>
<p>所以就初級兒童讀物而言，現在的毛病不在書少而在書的内容輾轉抄襲，缺乏新鮮的題材。這是和高級兒童讀物的毛病恰恰相反的！</p>
<p>話再回到那兒童書局罷。兒童書局出書不多，可是以我看來，牠有一個特色：一百○一册的兒童科學叢書。在文藝性兒童讀物充斥市塲的現今，區區一百○一册的兒童科學叢書可算是九牛一毛，如果有人學樣，也從這方面來競爭，未始不是好事；只要他肯認眞請人編撰，而不是組製濫造，影射漁利。</p>
<h3 id="c230">掘地洞 <a href="#c230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>— 達伍</p>
<p>日機到了北平，我軍仍說「抵抗到底」，自然囉，百姓只好趕快逃命。平浦客車票，一天便較平常多賣出一倍，第二天賣出更多，車站擁擠不堪。這眞是生意興隆啊！</p>
<p>但也有不逃而掘地洞的。平市小學校爲謀學生安全起見，一面派代表赴社會局請願，一面停課半日，以便掘地窟。（申報十一日北平專電），請願内容，大約是想要求當局，把小學生附在裝箱待運的第五批古物内，搭車南下罷。可憐古物已經運到第五批，小學生却方纔挖地洞，準備鑽入地下逃命。和這日機還没有隨古物南下，就早有人手抄遺敎，銅箱石匣，建塔寳藏一事比較起來，我們的感想如何？</p>
<p>但我却想起早幾天日軍在灤東的撤退來。有人推測那撤退的原因，不出三種：一日軍兵力不厚，我軍防衛鞏固。二戰事迫近灤東外人利益，三變更戰略，改道威脅平津。而我自己却推測是矮子東施效顰，也要來「誘敵深入」。</p>
<p>但當時據說灤東的難民紛紛遷回，「亦漸恢復營業」（四月二十九日申報專電）而報上也大大小小的登着「擊破」，「驅逐」，「推進」，「克復」，「佔領」等使人色喜的字樣。眞像中國人已由苦命，走到好命，雖然是托庇外人，但也是我軍抗日奏效。</p>
<p>然而抗日大事是很難逆料的，報上明明是登着「克復」「佔領」，忽然「顯與事實不符」起來。原來我軍只是「僅有極少部隊開往囗囗等縣城維持地方秩序，行車安寗」的，幷未「對日軍加以攻擊」。於是乎敵一挑釁，就多倫失守，日機到平，小學生挖地窟，像兎子一樣，逃入地下。</p>
<p>如今正是航空救國的時候，有了飛機，自然逃走得快。但拉拉扯扯，帶着許多小學生，諸多未便，所以只好挖地洞，埋在地下，以便珍藏。日本人的炸彈雖狠，其奈中國人上窮碧落下黄泉的逃走一空，連古物也早已運得乾乾凈凈，只剩下地洞裏幾個毛頭小子，有什麽辦法？</p>
<h3 id="c231">煤 <a href="#c231" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e231" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">231</a></h3>
<p>— 周楞伽</p>
<p>黄浦江，混濁的江水整天不斷的在流。江畔的和平女神像皺着眉尖向下瞧望，一艘飛機母艦的砲位正向着她。</p>
<p>機器在喧豗，馬達在震動，運煤的小工作把一百二十斤重的一籮煤往肩上扛。</p>
<p>天是陰曇的，空氣裏充滿了水分，氣壓低降，使人呼吸不暢。</p>
<p>「杭育！杭育！」一陣壓榨出來的苦悶的呼聲，衝破了江畔陰鬱的空氣，幾條醬色的筋肉突出的胳膊向上一舉，一籮重重的煤便又壓到了阿福的肩上。</p>
<p>阿福，一個從農村裏擠出來的青年，到江畔來幹這運煤的工作，已經有兩個月了。</p>
<p>兩個月，成天價把煤從卡車上扛下來，帶着跑步的姿勢，運到那高大的江輪上去，煤籮重重的，壓得他的背脊向下鬱，壓得他的脇骨隱隱的作痛：但他還得扛，還得搬。</p>
<p>廣告牌上的女人，吸着烟，很暇豫的瞧着他笑，笑他儍。不錯，他是儍，可是不儍便没得吃。貧困的人類是活該把汗血壓榨出來換飯吃的。</p>
<p>汗在流，血在流，脇骨在作痛。没有人憐憫他，只有那一籮籮的煤，彷彿和他作對似的，不斷地由卡車運載到江畔來壓他的肩。</p>
<p>這世上，好像出産着無盡量的煤，終他的一生也搬運不盡一樣。</p>
<p>「嘿，眞混賬！一天四毛錢，得扛上百多籮煤，多偺總有一天把咱壓死啊！」有時他實在忍耐不住了，也會咕嚷着說上這麽幾句，可是一想到生活，一想到餓肚子的難受，終於只有咽一口涎沫，悄没聲兒的攢着勁，蹲下腰，等候同伴們把一籮籮的煤舉起，壓到他肩上來。他是知足的，他並不希望有什麽山珍海味到他口裏來，他只要一天不缺幾個大餅油條粢飯團就夠了。</p>
<p>他的夢魂是安適的，他並不希望有什麽女人抱在他懷裏，他只要有一個睡覺的地方，不論是貧民窟也好，是露天的水門汀也好，他都會倒下頭來酣睡。</p>
<p>可是，不平的事情，終於降臨到他身上來了。</p>
<p>一天，正當他帶着跑步的姿勢，把煤扛上江輪去的時候，他的脚怱然在江堤上踐着塊香蕉皮，滑了一個筋斗。於是，一百二十斤重的一籮煤，便倒下來，全壓在他背上，煤屑舖滿了他一身。這一壓的力量眞不輕，使他身體内部像被人扎了一刀似的，不自主的吐出一口血來。</p>
<p>他抬起頭來，向輪上瞧望。江輪的甲板上，正有一對青年男女，倚着欄干，在熱情地談話，一壁手裏剥着香蕉送進口去，好像不知道輪下有他們的手造的一幕慘劇一樣。</p>
<p>他不禁倒抽了一口冷氣，滿腔怒火直冒出來：</p>
<p>「媽的！咱老子眞得要死，倒給你們小兩口子尋開心！」</p>
<p>可是他並不敢跑上去打他們，報仇。他祇忍着痛爬回了他住的那所貧民窟裏。</p>
<p>這一夜，他痛得要命，把手撫着胸口呌喊着，流了一夜的眼淚。</p>
<p>第二天，當同伴們維續到江畔去照常做還煤工作時，不見了阿福的踪影，誰都不知道他到那裏去了。</p>
<p>一天，兩天，日子箭一般飛過了，阿福始終没有下落。祇有江畔的一切都依舊：和平女神在皺着眉尖向下瞧望，廣告牌上的女人在吸着烟微笑，江輪上的汽笛在吼呌，沙遜大厦的屋頂在閃耀着金光，别的運煤的小工依舊在曇的天陰鬱的空氣裏勞動。</p>

<p>（二十八）安内乎？攘外乎？</p>
<p>晚清當局，顢頇關茸。其於外交上不恤喪權辱國，而於内政上惟恐民權獲伸。一面力拒立憲派懇切之請求，一面予革命黨以殘酷之鎭壓。蠆若輩豫存「寧贈朋友，不與家奴」之私心，以爲安内重於攘外。其卒也，因外之不能攘，而内愈無以安，清社遂屋矣。予以爲明清之亡，如出一轍。晚明國政，敗於官邪。黨禍頻興，藉快私意：强宼不拒，議欵是圖。當滿洲兵之席卷華北，進逼江南也，南京小朝廷尙有安内攘外之爭，相持不下。姦黨馬士英阮大鋮輩，力主先事安内，討伐左良玉異已之師旅，江南兵力不足，至撤江北禦侮之兵以益之。時滿洲兵日南下，大理少卿姚思孝，御史喬可聘，成友謙，請無撤江北兵，亟守維揚。士英厲聲叱曰：「若輩東林，猶藉口江防，欲縱左逆入犯耶？北兵至，猶可議欵：左逆至，則若輩高官，我君臣獨死耳」。思孝等懼遭嚴厲之處置，不敢再議禦侮。淮揚備禦益弱，滿洲兵乃長驅直入，屠揚州，破南京，而擒福王矣。雖謂有明之亡，亡於專事内戰，不攘外宼，可也。安内乎？攘外乎？當局者迷，旁觀者清。吾人生於明清之後，而論明清之所以亡，又何患伸紙濡筆，無以置詞也哉？</p>

<p>亞伽特（續）</p>
<p>雷辟克差不多把麵包吃完了。亞伽特這次却不讓他搶先了。她竭全力注意着雷辟克，以至把其餘的人全忘記了，雷辟克家的冷然說道：</p>
<p>「亞伽特，你在幹什麽？」</p>
<p>這樣把麵提醒來。</p>
<p>「我在這裏，太太，」亞伽特回答。</p>
<p>她更加目不旁瞬地瞧着雷辟克。她想以她的慇懃來征服他，並努力使他注意自己</p>
<p>她没有錯過機會。</p>
<p>當雷辟克嚼着最後一口麵包時，她連忙跑到碗櫃那邊，拿來一個没有切開的，計重五公斤的環形麵包，很誠懇地獻給他，自己非常高興以爲猜中了主人的需要。</p>
<p>可是雷辟克把飯巾取下，離開食桌，戴上帽子往花園裏面抽烟去了。</p>
<p>當他吃完了飯時，他不會再吃的。</p>
<p>亞伽特抱着那計重五公斤的環形麵包，呆立在那裏，好像一個製造救命圈工廠的蠟人廣告一様。</p>

<p>「這事使你難受吧，」紅蘿蔔鬚對亞伽特說，當廚房裏祗剩下他們兩入時，「你可不要灰心，還有更難受的事情在後頭呢。你拿着這些洒瓶到那裏去？」</p>
<p>「到地窖裏面去，紅蘿蔔鬚先生。」</p>
<p>紅蘿蔔鬚說：</p>
<p>「對不起，地窖裏面是祗有我好去的。那樓梯壞透了，女人們踏不住脚，頸根都會跌斷的，而我却從能够走下樓梯的那天起，便取得大家的信賴了。我可以在那裏面分辨出酒瓶上的紅藍兩色商標。</p>

<p>— 贍廬</p>
<p>吳諺中對於人家的貶詞，有輕量的，有重量的！例如，譏人齷齪，單說齷齪兩字，這是輕量的貶詞；進一層便是齷裏齷齪，那麽成爲重量的貶詞了。笑人糊塗，單說糊塗兩字，這是輕量的貶詞；進一層便是糊裏糊塗，那麽成爲重量的貶詞了。由此類推，單說外行，曲氣，疙，囉囌，丨「註」都是輕量的貶詞；要是，加重了質量，便是外裏外行，曲裏曲氣，疙裏疙，囉裏囉囌，那麽都成爲重量的貶詞了。從這上面，我又得到一個公式：凡是形容字上面，重複一個字，再加着一個裏字，都是不滿意的批評，而不適用於滿意的批評。只有齷裏齷齪，没有乾裏乾凈；只有糊裏糊塗，没有清裏清爽；只有外裏外行，没有内裏内行；只有疙裏疙，没有爽裏爽氣；只有囉裏囉囌，没有簡裏簡括；可見常言俗語中，也有一定的文字法租。</p>
<p>滿意的批評，要把兩字形容，化爲四字形容，只有用一個疊字法。例如，乾乾凈凈，清清爽爽，爽爽氣氣，簡簡括括，都是由二而化爲四的形容字。這般的用法，便是不滿意的批評也適用的；旣可說齷裏齷齪，也可說齷齷齪齪；旣可說糊裏糊塗，也可說糊糊塗塗；其他，可以類推。丨齷齷齪齪，糊湖塗塗，也只是輕量的貶詞；和糊裏糊塗，齷裏齷齪的重量的貶詞，略有不同。</p>
<p>「註」俗稱言語支蔓，呌做囉囌；其實，只是絡索之誤，囉裏囉囌，便是給裏絡索；囉囉囌囌，便是絡絡索索。</p>

<p>— 庸子</p>
<p>「不怕兇，只怕窮，」窮人是世界上不及哈叭狗値錢的東西，不料居然有人怕，眞是做夢也不曾想到的光榮。</p>
<p>對啦，在滬戰時兇得不可一世的「皇軍」就給幾顆手溜彈打得「屢進屢退，」惟有做了一世窮光蛋的，一做了漢奸，便像六月裏的臭虫蚊子，使人望見了，毛髮悚然。</p>
<p>世界上見着窮人怕的例子正多咧。有一個大冷天，在下同一位朋友走過某馬路，突然有一位穿着拖一爿，掛一塊底夾袍子的窮人，跟着我那朋友稱老表。我那朋友雖矢口不承認，但終於挖了一下腰包。從此之後，便不敢再走某馬路，他說，怕再碰到那窮小子。</p>
<p>誠然，窮人窮到没路走，甚麽都幹得出來。軟的不來，硬的準行。先來一下嚇詐信，再來一下綁架勒贖，不怕挺胸突肚的大老關不怕。</p>
<p>無産階級，已沾上了七分窮氣。無産階級再失了業，那是初一月半都不打折扣的窮人了，窮人旁的都不吃香，惟有使人見着怕，才能頂着天而立着地。所以世界文明各國，不得不挖空心思，謀所以解决「救濟失業」之道。就是，們貴中華的民國，也正爲了農人窮得透了頂，大吹大擂地計劃「復興農村。」</p>
<p>「救濟失業，」「復興農村，」爲着甚麽來？打開天窗說亮話，不是怕「窮人」造反麽？</p>
<p>但是窮得可以使人怕，至少須有窮到不要驗，不要命的程度。像在下這麽雖會不要臉而說「窮話，」究竟還不肯不要命的幹。不肯不要命的幹，就没有人怕。讀者之中，想必有與在下旣要錢，又要命，志同道合者，便也一世莫想沾到「窮光，」而使人怕。</p>

<p>— 柯定盦</p>
<p>國難當頭的今日，我們一般大衆，想盡了種種方法來救國，像「航空救國」「軍事救國，」甚至還有：「跳舞救國」「娛樂救國」……等我以爲最切要的當以「國貨救國」爲最重大，而且是人人可以實行，不必有什麽預備和訓練，大衆祗須抱定自今以後：「非國貨不買」的固定宗旨，這樣的慢慢地由近及遠，一人行之，百人隨之，以及全國的大衆都照樣實行，然後國貨普遍全國，生産者不絕地生産，購用者不絕地購用，那時候我們經濟充實，一般外侮，自然會消滅得乾凈。</p>
<p>以國貨救國爲宗旨的中國國貨公司，因爲見到一般現代中心的人物，他們對於服裝，總是外貨是求，倘然不資以借鏡，以後外貨的銷路，還要有增無减，所以他們毅然來舉行一個震驚全滬的時裝表演大會，請了許多電影明星，如胡蝶，徐來，高情蘋，艾　，宣景琳，胡萍，顧海君：：等女士，來担任時裝表演，那三天會期中，來參與的全滬閨閣名媛，不下三萬餘人之多，眞所謂：「衣香鬢影，衆妙紛陳，」呢！</p>
<p>在那明星表演的時裝裏，他們的衣料的是分做，綢緞，呢絨，布疋來做成的，時裝的種類，有大衣，長袍，短大衣，馬甲，西服，以及别出心裁的各種服裝，最引人注意的，是胡蝶穿的玄色軟緞的短衣和半長褲，鑲以白紅色交互的花邊，領是用扯襟式，脚管也鑲同樣的花邊，腰際束一條紅白黑交色的絲帶，具有東方色彩，伊一出來，掌聲同雷樣地響了。</p>
<p>還有徐來穿的上面用紅白色柳條喬其紗懸成，下面用紅黄色大花的喬其紗做的，肩頭蓋有荷葉下埀式的披肩，腰際用大摺襇，走起來很能舒展脚底，就是用平常穿着，也很合宜，艾霞女士的長衣，以及短馬甲：顧梅君的細腰胸結袒肩的裝束，也能顯露天眞的美，宣景琳的白軟緞長衣，胡萍的淡綠印度綢袒肩短袖的服裝，都能表示伊們的個性。</p>
<p>這次的時裝大會，據說：「綢緞，呢絨，布疋，共製九十餘襲，費三千餘金，」我知道這樣偉大的宣傳，定能博得閨閣名媛的同情，不會再去購用外貨了。</p>

<h3 id="c261">戲劇化的敎育影片 <a href="#c261" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e261" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">261</a></h3>
<p>電影是第八種藝術，　之所以列在繪畫，音樂，舞蹈，戲劇，雕刻，小說，詩歌，之後者，因它的歷史比較其他藝術爲短，但它對於社會所發生的影響，比較任何藝術爲大。所以西洋各國，無不竭其全力以經營電影事業，像意大利，蘇俄，更利用電影，做各種新建設之推動機。</p>
<p>中國文化衰落，文盲充斥，這是無可諱言的事實。文盲不掃除，實爲建設新中國之大障礙，但是掃除文盲，不是短時期中可以辦到，欲求功近而收效速，祇有從電影入手。我相信電影是改造社會的利器，推進文化的工具。</p>
<p>從前電影從　者，視電影爲一種供人消遣娛樂的東西，所以只求迎合一般觀衆的低級心理。其實電影决不是僅僅供人消遣娛樂，必須在消遣娛樂之中，包含着敎育上文化上的意義。最近電影從業者，已覺悟到電影對於社會所負的使命，很是重大，已放棄營業可操左劵的「武俠」「神怪」等影片，來攝製反封建的，有革命性的影片，他們對於電影劇本的取材，無疑地有了顯著的轉變。</p>
<p>這次中國敎育電影協會工作計畫書中，對於電影所應負的使命，有一個具體的規定，它的綱目是：（甲）發揚民族精神。（一）顯露東方文化的優點；宣傳中國歷史的光榮：（三）表演民族革命的過程。（乙）鼓勵生産建設。（一）由都市而轉向農村；（二）宣傳已成的建設；（三）宣傳未完成的建設；（四）指示未開發的富源。（丙）灌輸科學智識。（丁）發揚革命精神。（一）發揚犧牲奮鬥的精神；（二）發揚刻苦耐勞的精神；（三）發揚服務創造的精神。（戊）建立國民道德。</p>
<p>他們工作計畫書中，又擬編製敎育影片劇本，一種是課本化的敎育影片，一種是戲劇化的敎育影片，但是因爲費用浩大，暫時難以施行。我以爲課本化的敎育影片，在事實上，電影公司或許不能攝製，至於戲劇化的敎育影片，電影公司儘可攝製。這敎育影片，仍是以發揚民族精神，研究生産建設，灌輸科學智識，建立國民道德爲原則，不是枯燥無味說敎式的影片。所以戲劇化的敎育影片，是要戲劇的趣味和敎育的意義並重。像最近天一公司有聲影片「生機」，便是一個例子。</p>
<p>「生機」描寫一個女子奮鬥的過程，充分地發揚「犧牲奮門」「刻苦耐勞」「服務創造」的精神，確是含着敎育意義，但是故事的動人，技巧的美妙，對於戲劇的趣味也是非常濃厚的（鳳舉）</p>

<p>憧憬都市，似乎是甜蜜的，可是走進都市，便如同入人苦海。都市，根據着社會學的原理，本來是一種畸形的組織，無用說，都市的一切。自然要呈露着畸形的狀態了。所以我們對都市有了這種認識，還得加以一番考察，丨丨究竟　樣可以使已在都市的人們改善起來？換句話　　　　的内層是什麽？</p>
<p>很可以瞧出，都市中有一角，爲環境壓追的女子，往往具着一顆純潔的心，預備進去社會去服務，謀生。可是結果呢？被誘惑，被遺棄，一身的汚辱，永永洗不了。婦女解放，職業平等，都給惡魔克制着，而都市中也就平添了一層烏黯，使全部變成漆黑一團。</p>
<p>我有不少的女同學，脫離了學校，就流入了這個途徑。理智不知那裏去？祗管享樂，直到人老殊黄，恐怕還不會覺悟罷！</p>
<p>昨偕女友往觀明星最近四達通聲片「脂粉市塲」一片。眞的出乎我的意外，覺得這片的意識，完全根據上述那幾點，積極的，樂觀的，很能使我們興奮，同時，也値得我在寫這篇的末了附帶述及和紹介。</p>

<p>— 吾</p>
<p>日帝國主義眞可謂胆大極了，在咱們中國屢次正式宣稱「敵如來攻我决抵抗」，而且是「一貫方針永不改變」的，如此强硬的態度之下，居然敢在佔領熱河與多倫之後，而明目張胆的派飛機來平擲彈，這一點固然可以證明日帝國主義的確實「暴行」，同時也使我們懷疑到咱們政府的「宣言」還不夠使敵人嚇得誠惶誠恐的貼貼服服。</p>
<p>十一日晨七時二十分左右，日機大槪確實是到北平偵察過一次，附帶的還要散散傳單，並且據中央社電：「經該處我軍用高射機關槍射擊」，所以「未敢下降」，甚而至於「因恐射擊，即向永定門逃去」。旣然是中央社電，當然很是可靠，而且我軍旣經「射擊」一通，更足以增加國威不少。但是據同日的路透社電，却又說「今晨天空顧客之疑團，現益增甚」，該電文内開：「唯日使署聲稱，日機是否曾臨平城天空，使署旣不能徴實之，亦不能否認之」。這一點我們當然不必相信日使署的誑話，不過「又當時高射砲一節，數方面所傳。亦不一其詞，而且是「外人之目覩者，亦未聞砲聲」。這一節眞使我們順天安命的老百姓們不惜爲之搖頭嘆氣，難道我軍連放幾聲大砲也要吹牛皮。幸而同一電文中又說：「按北平地面遼闊，一處發砲，他處未聞，此確爲可能事一，是以我們到底還是放心。加之「我防空司令部，以敵機竟敢來平肆擾，爲保護中外居民起見，對防空事宜，已積極佈置。同時外人方面，以平市係一城市，非軍事區域，對敵機任意偵察，深爲不滿，將向日方提出質問」，（以上見同日中央社電）這樣一來，北平的老百姓可以放心，而南方的老百姓更可放心何况以上各節，還可以十二日的電文證賽：</p>
<p>一敵機今晨再度飛平，「每遇敵機飛至街衢上空時，我高射砲機關槍與步槍，即集中以射」。而且居民都「出床仰視」，可作見證。</p>
<p>二「敵機高翔在二千米達以上，避我射擊。</p>

<p>[P貓&gt;</p>
<p>— 毓</p>
<p>我的妻子特别喜歡貓，自從我去年小病，那花貓溺死之後，她又討來一隻幾乎純白的貓。遍身雪白，僅僅在背上有二塊銅元大的淺灰色。她爲牠做了一付小被褥，平舖在特製的木箱中，每晚臨睡，她先迷迷的呼牠進來，輕輕地捉進木箱後，自己才能安睡。日後牠也知知了規定的時間，到時候不必呼喚，牠早已乖乖的安睡在木箱裏，頭，四肢，都曲在一起，背部微微的起伏，那一個淺灰色的圓形也怪好看的一高一低，妻者是拍着手說：一那貓眞好呵，人還没有牠聽話」！說後她側着頭瞧我的態度，好像你知道嗎，這句話是什麽意思？這時候大槪我正在寫字或者看書丨這我已成了習慣。晚餐後老是和同居的人家閒談，那貓睡進木箱，我才像發覺這是應敢寫字或者看書的時候了，這樣非到十一二點鐘是不肯安睡的；妻睡得很早，她見我不肯早睡，就俏皮的說我不及貓聽話；我見她側着頭得意的微笑，也故意的說：「人本來那裏有貓的聰明」！「是呀」！她以爲我没有知道她的俏皮，很快活的笑了。</p>
<p>這貓成了我們小家庭中的一員。</p>
<p>春風吹醒了大地，某一天晚上，那可愛的貓失縱了。妻各處找尋，呼喚，並不見牠的影子，她發急了說：「誰偷了我的貓，不得好死的」！</p>
<p>我知道她失了每樣心愛的東西，最後總是這樣說了才舒服，這夜她不則一聲的陪坐在我的寫字檯旁，意外的到一點鐘和我同睡，在床上還是像和誰生氣似的啋着嘴，我輕輕的吻上她的唇說：「幹麽」同時「迷……嗚」的呌聲從屋頂送來，妻推開了我坐起身來，</p>

<p>「是阿白」！她肯定的說。</p>
<p>她推開被想跨下床去，我捉住她的手說：「你爬上屋頂去嗎？明天牠自會回來的」！</p>
<p>「迷……嗚」呌聲漸漸近來，這怪難聽的「聲，妻傷醒悟了似的笑着重　進被來，我隨口說：「惱人的春天啊，女人的屁鼓也懶得去模了」！</p>
<p>我大腿上輕輕的着了一拳。</p>
<p>貓的肚子慢慢膨脹，妻忙着預備生産院。兩禮拜前牠産了二隻像母親同樣可愛的小貓，妻快活得什麽似的捧着阿白，那箱子也搬到我們床下，看牠哺乳，那二隻小貓也時常捧着玩，昨天我們從文廟公園歸來，二隻小貓不知被阿白搬到那裏去了，妻像哄小孩子似的對阿白說話，但是阿白倒底不及人聽話，始終迷迷的没有回答，晚上也没有睡到木箱來。我對妻說：</p>
<p>「你做了傀儡啊！牠有了兒女就把你忘了，還是不聽話的好罷！」</p>
<p>「呸！我明天一定尋牠回來」。</p>
<p>「迷…嗚」今天早上這呌聲又從屋頂送來。妻推開窗來望了望那阿白，失望似的呆了半晌。</p>
<p>「迷…嗚」從這屋頂送到那屋頂。</p>

<p>— 甘休</p>
<p>這是人們所謂‘Ｐaradise，的夜！</p>
<p>ＮeonＬight輝耀着它的炫目的勾人的紅綠光，在空間巍然聳立着光燦閃爍的建築物，柏油路上湧者滾滾的混濁人和車的潮，這許多人，大家像去趕要事似的擠着！一股股的汗珠直流着，溢出了那　鼻的臭味丨不顧一切地　　！</p>
<p>那神秘的彌慢着咖啡香的Ｃaberet，從門縫間溢出了高囂的笑聲：醇厚的Ｃocbtail的味兒；震蕩的華爾滋的旋律；於是一班馬路巡閱者翹着足窺探着，竊聽着，流着欣羨的嫉妒的神情，毫不倦怠的候着，直待那披上制服的巡捕用木棍來欵待他們！</p>
<p>外邊，那熙攘的人行道上，許多浮狂的少年蜂蝶似地跟蹤在每一位年輕的美麗的女性後面，口曲的吹嘯，熱情的挑逗，於是，那年輕的漂亮的姑娘們，，回擲他們一個輕俏的媚波，巧笑；成是低駡，佯詈！</p>
<p>此外在隱靜的建築物的陰影裏，顚倒地演繹着一種相反的悲慘的喜劇，看罷！每一個男性的後面，不拘是白髮的，成年的，孱弱的，强壯的，衫履的，短裝的男性的後面，總跟上了一個或一個以上的女性：石膏的面孔，呆滯的眼珠，僵硬的行尸般的軀體，後面老鴇暮氣沉沉地跟着；當一輛疾馳的汽車的弧光燈撂過她們的瘦臉時，每一個面兒都是無表情地呆着！</p>
<p>爲了要滿足老鴇們的貪壑，爲了要饜足男子們的獸慾，爲了她們自身的苟延微軀，才迫不得已地受着凌遲的極刑，没有快樂和安慰，她們的頭上盤旋着那厄運的石子，那些石子，隨時隨地打在她們的頭上：當她們消失了最後的青春的美麗時，那就是宣佈那厄運之石擊她們致命的一刻兒。</p>
<p>這時候，或許正有人在歌頌着大都市的偉大，而尤其是大都市的夜的偉大！</p>
<p>而適巧在這偉大的都市的夜的雰圍裏，掩藏着一部悲慘的殘忍的命運！</p>

<p>— 爾礎</p>
<p>還記得前幾天，曾有人在本刋上做了一篇「女學生在上海」可爲淋漓盡致。在下也僅了一篇「男學生在上海」，以資男女平等。效顰之機，自當難免。</p>
<p>「男學生」這名詞，多少會給人一種神秘的幻想；尤其是一般中學生，大學生。眞的，那穿的齊整的西服革履，脅下挾着幾英寸厚的原版西書，…啊！那一切，會迅速的隨着湧進腦來，</p>
<p>家長們出了巨資？將他們送進學校，國家殷殷的加以栽培，究竟爲的什麽？他們在學校裏到底幹了些什麽，能不負自己亦不負人的事？他們是否已認清了這動盪着的大時代？他們是否已負起了應負的當前的重大使命？</p>
<p>哼！說也痛心！大部份的男學生，却還在和自己搗蛋。不消說，自欺欺人。徒然靡費了多量的金錢，而其結果則一無所得，反染上了窮奢極侈的歐化惡習，還兼着一顆矜持的心。意志萎頽，精神渙散，始終這麽渾渾噩噩的沉醉着，麻木着，度日子，無異是一具活動的屍骸。無聯的時候，不是彈幾隻靡靡之曲，便是哼幾首肉麻的詩歌。電影院跳舞場的奔走忙碌，便是他們的日常生活。活的不耐煩了「就來幾下自殺的把戲，反正又可被稱爲「憂國自殺」，出出「死」風頭。至於什麽學問不學問，國難不國難，大可置之腦後，且待娛樂一下再談（？）好在日本鬼子還在老遠的北方哩！</p>
<p>有幾位好的漂亮的學生，也幹幹什麽「抗日會」的玩意兒，在講壇上演說了一篇；自然，理直氣壯，四座爲之震驚，口口聲聲「共赴國難」，「青年學生不可再事麻木」，…下得講壇，依然故我，晚上照常辦公，丨逛舞塲看電影丨他們直不愧　「電影救國」，「跳舞救國」的前導者（？）</p>
<p>偶然，該死的敎授要臨時測騐，那麽糟糕！眞把我們的少爺學生急壞了，暫時祇好做做劉備。但不妨，停一會在運動場上，可又是張飛了哩！</p>
<p>哦！學生是國家未來的主人翁？是收進社會的中堅份子。是領導民衆的領袖？是革新政治的先鋒隊？是………吁戲！偉哉男學生！我欲無言！</p>

<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>她朝床上望去，章大爺仍然睡得像猪似的。本來她應當走過去拿條被氈給他蓋上，但因爲懶得動顫，也就算了。</p>
<p>不知在什麽時候，章大爺到底醒來了，少不了對於睡在身邊的小美人要溫柔的體貼一番，自然說了不少糖似的貼心話，然而柳姑娘却不見如何感動，這一來自不免十分掃興。但是章大爺總是一番好意，最顯著的是决心要救她拔出這妓院的火阱。辦法是自己直到現在還只有一個結髮多年太太，照自己的身份來說，很應當討一個小星。那末柳姑娘自然很足以佔據這一地位。</p>
<p>柳姑娘很小心聽了一番熱情話，照理是値得興奮起來的，然而她却不肯具體的說明自己的意見，老是「哼哼哼」的應着。這樣一來，直使我們的章大爺摸不着頭腦。其後柳姑娘眼睜睜守着天亮，大槪是因爲失眠的原故，腦袋十分脹痛，她掙扎着起來喝了一杯冷茶，走着窗前望着灰暗的天空。她沉重的嘆了一口氣，心裏想：</p>
<p>「也好，就嫁給他罷。」</p>
<p>（九）在幸福之中</p>
<p>自那晚柳姑娘答應了章大爺的要求之後，經過他幾次的談判，柳姑娘居然嫁過來了。</p>
<p>據武貴的意思，柳姑娘對於這一次事並不見得如何了不起的高興，不過楊家鴇母却趁此機會發了一筆大財却是眞的，不說别的，單就身價而言，原來開價是一千二百元，章大爺只肯出六百，當然差得太多，其後總算是八百元成交了。不過還有章大爺送了鴇母的四色禮物不算在内：一件狐腿大襖，一雙大圈兒的金耳環，……雖然在章大爺都是現成的，只消在自己的當舖裏拿來就是，可是算起來也要値二三百元的。然而楊家鴇母每次和别人談起，總說是修心做好事，不願意糟塌年青的女兒，所以也就便宜脫手了。假如再留住幾年，她拿得準，還可以賺大錢的。</p>
<p>可是天下的事，也就眞有使人摸不着理由的。譬如章大爺這次討柳姑娘過門，花了這麽大的價錢，照理是應當痛得寳貝似的。然而事實上並不如此，他除了開頭的一個多月常時到她房裏睡睡以外，這一次上任做官便没有帶她去。固然章太太爲了這事吵過好幾次，聽說將那一座鑲玉的時鐘也忿氣打碎了：但是章大爺如果一定要柳姑娘也帶上任去，難道章太太又有什麽方法能夠阻擋得住，何况她現在已經快五十歲了，從來就没有生過一男半女，章大爺很可以以此爲理由，難道柳姑娘長年不和章大爺見面也能夠替章家傳家接代嗎？所以章大爺就没有將她整個的放在心坎上到是眞的。</p>

<h3 id="c271">電影鑑賞的小常識 <a href="#c271" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e271" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">271</a></h3>
<p>— 姚寅仲</p>
<p>電影之在今日，無疑地，已爲一般人狂熱地歡迎和愛好着，成了普遍的形勢；而國製電影事業之發達，也不讓外人，這尤是甚可欣慰的事。只可惜國人於鑑賞方面的常識，似乎還欠缺了些。我現不揣淺陋，就個人觀影所得經騐，貢獻給大家，以與大家商榷。</p>
<p>無論何片，其成立的條件均有四項，即：</p>
<p>（一）劇本電影的本質，原亦戲劇之一，它當然與其他戲劇同樣是需要劇本的；一片之有無價値，與劇本的優劣很有關係，所以要有優良的劇本，才有偉大的片子；這是不用說的了。至劇本的成立條件亦有二：一爲題材，二爲意識。題材是搆成劇本的要素，而意識却可說是它的骨𠏉。我們在這兒所要注意的，也就是這兩項。</p>
<p>（二）演員有了劇本，而無演員，便無從産生片子。而一張好的片子，亦需要好的演員去演奏；所謂好的演員，當然是要對電影有充分修養的了。我們在這兒所黨注意的，這個演員在片中所去的解色是否適合，演奏工夫，是否無疵；最要緊的，他們是否能將人物的個性充分表暴出來。</p>
<p>（三）導演有了劇本和演員，還須分配和佈排，並指示表演，這就是所謂「導演」者的職責了。他在片子的地位和權威之大，也就可以想見，有人比之軍隊的總司令，是再適切没有的了。所以一片之爲優爲劣，在在與有至密之關係；歐美的名貴鉅片，莫不由本領高超的導演所造成。我們這兒應注意的，當然是他對這片子全體的設計工夫；至於技巧和手法，也是同時應注意的。</p>
<p>（四）攝影劇本佈排妥了，演員分配好了，而且演奏了，以後就是把它們攝入鏡頭。工夫到了這層，才算完成；所謂「攝影技師，」就是在導演的節制之下工作的，他的職務包括片子的「光線」·「字幕」·「畫面」·「背景」·以及「人物。」而我們在這兒應注意的，也便是這些。</p>
<p>以外，現在是有聲片盛行的時代，對於它的「音樂」·「歌唱」·「對白」·方面，也應予以注意。我們要在上面這幾方面下功夫去鑑賞，决不可忽略了一二點；要是不然，就算不得盡了鑑賞的功夫。臨了，我還得向大家說的，就是要認明電影亦是藝術，而且是科學化的藝術。（却酬）</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3 id="c272">評「同途異轍」ＳtrictlyＰersonal <a href="#c272" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e272" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">272</a></h3>
<p>— 燕南</p>
<p>我對於派拉蒙公司的出品，的確有一種莫名的好感。雖然不敢說牠的每一張影片都是好的。但是多數總不甚惡劣。不及格的實在很少。「同途異轍」ＳtrictlyＰersonal雖然全片實在找不出什麽特别好的地方，同時却也不能說有什麽不好。一切都是緊沿着水平線走。</p>
<p>故事在美國片裏，應當算是上乘的了。這裏没有什麽黄金色的幻夢，只是一種社會裏很普遍的現象而已。不過如果不是編劇者有疏漏的話，那末導演者便應負其咎的。全片大致上，並没有什麽說不過去的地方，而小節上，却有若干的脫漏，本事上也有很糢糊的意識，前後好似不大連貫的。簡略的說，牠是述一雙老夫婦，因爲曾經入獄，逃出後頗知悔悟，帶了一個朋友的女兒在小鎭上設立一個小俱樂部。不料有一個土棍跑來，以告發逃獄事件爲要挾，打算侵佔這俱樂部，老夫婦没法，只好和他約定利益均分。那土棍不久就作了一件謀財害命的案子，移禍於那老夫婦，幸憑據不確，被釋，那土棍又引誘老夫婦的朋友之女，打算同赴墨西哥·到了飛機塲·土棍忽被槍殺。有一個少年記者本是愛慕女郎的，於是相偕而歸。</p>
<p>說明書譯得不切實，而劇義也缺少中心。演出時對白太多，有時許多廢話而談不到本題，例如土棍到底被誰殺的，終没有說明白，又如女郎的父親被釋，女郎投靠小俱樂部，一切演員的表演，都非常矛看，不近人情。</p>
<p>法庭對於命案，竟輕輕表過，實在是爲了遷就全劇的收束，竟不惜置法律精神於不願，還有形容美國記者的無聊，討厭，和窘態，眞入木三分，呌人又好笑又可憐。</p>
<p>說句時髦話，對白是很「幽默」的，……雖然没有一個是滑稽演員，但是笑料却不在少數，導演對於分幕上，表現上，也頗有盡責的地方，攝影，光線，收音，外景，佈置等……依照美國片的成績標準而論，僅僅是中等而已。</p>
<p>表演上老太婆瑪嬌麗蘭寳ＭarjorieＲambeau是主角，表情多優越可取，全片中成績却以桃樂賽喬鄧ＤorothyＪordan爲最好，很似一個不知世故的女孩子。</p>
<h3 id="c273">評「和平之花」小公司出品難能可貴了 <a href="#c273" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e273" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">273</a></h3>
<p>友聯公司自去年冬天停辦之後，多一半的演員職員，都已改進明星公司。不過從一九三○到三二夏天，兩年之中，所製成的影片，有十張之多。但爲了改組等等關係，都没有公映過。最近友聯公司清理處已着手結束，於是將所有影片，全數出清，以便歸清各股東的本利。「和平之花」就是那些存貸中的第一張。</p>
<p>友聯攝製「虞美人」，是一九三○冬天的事，亦是中國自製的第一部聲片。後來又以邇台大本的荒江女俠作號召。可是這張「和平之花」，一班有聲，二班武俠（？），居然改變了一個新的作風，故事也極新頴。其中影射之處很多。例如和平谷，顯明是代表了中國，金約代表某國軍閥；顧國思影指中國人民；符立是說溥儀…等。看過這影片的人，一定能很明瞭的。</p>
<p>本事的大略：和平谷不幸被强鄰金約來霸佔了。谷民有一個呌顧國思謀抵抗未遂。舊谷主的女兒，遊學在外，後來回到谷中，谷主已被殺。於是她聯絡同志誓報父仇。谷民推顧國思爲首，裏應外合，將金約殺死，將！切强徒驅出境外，而金約手下反正大將漢民，和舊谷主女兒遂成了多情眷屬。</p>
<p>演出時候很容易看出導演的技巧。分幕等等，都無怠可擊。在攝影上也有相當的成功。光線仍以外影爲多，所以完全利用日光。内中只有二小段，因鏡頭焦點，没有合適，所以人物照得太黑了一些。脫節疏漏之處很少。比較中小公司出品，難得如此。</p>
<p>烏發高蒙聯合出品「桃花村」的一幕，賈克霍蘭勃和遜尼海爾，正在向置琳哈蕙大獻慇懃，這是一部以大自然界爲背景的音樂歌唱艶趣片子，定於本星期三公映於南京大戲院，</p>
<p>很大的一個遺憾，導演偷襲了武俠影片的故智，弄巧成拙。穿揷了大段的亂打，眞和小孩子打架一樣。谷民三四十人，賊黨二三十人，所謂大隊人馬，如此而已，太兒戲了。比劍和戲台上全武行一樣，以扑跌擅長，可惜得很</p>
<p>表演全體平平。包古松略佳，葉娟娟少少兩幕也足動人，徐琴芳武功竄躊甚好，表情幼稚。自噲以下，更不足論。</p>
<p>這一張影片，旣是中國小公司出品，我倒情願介紹諸位去看一看。</p>
<h3 id="c274">値得介紹的「桃花村」 <a href="#c274" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e274" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">274</a></h3>
<p>— 馨甫</p>
<p>本星期三起映於南京</p>
<p>德英影業聯合作品的「春江花月夜」，已經轟動了全滬的中外影迷，現在這一部喧傳已久，烏發高蒙聯合出品的「桃花村」ＨappyＥverＡfter，又將于本星期三起，公映於南京大戲院了，這是烏發製片巨頭歐利克龐麥的最新作品，他所監製的片子，多少總有點特殊的地方·這部「桃花村」，當然也不能例外了·</p>
<p>它是一部描寫小資産階級生活片叚的片子·搆造是完全和「春江花月夜」不同的·因爲「春江花月夜」所介紹到銀幕上的，祇有悅耳的歌唱，悠揚的音樂，輕鬆的滑稽和柔麗的山光水色；而「桃花村」一片，除掉擁有上面的幾個條件外，對於故事的進展，表演的生動，更有非常的成功·</p>
<p>因「龍翔鳳舞」一片得名，給美國重金聘去的麗琳哈蕙，在這部片子裏，飾一位無家可歸的村女，倫敦新世紀報，說她的表演，從來没有像在這部「桃花村」裏那末動人·賈克霍爾勃和遜尼海爾，在這裏面飾一對小威利·一個是去年在卡爾登開映「歡喜緣」的主角；一個已經在「春江花月夜」裏和我們見過面了·並且各報都說他是表情最好的一個·這三位明星聚在一起·它的成績怎樣·我們也就可以猜想到了·</p>

<p>「約翰，約翰，」曼麗的聲音又復充滿着鼓勵前進的精神，「站立起來，鼓起你的勇氣，恢復你向來的精神！我們從前毫無指望的時候，還能奮鬥到底，博得勝利。我們前途的戰爭，比以前所經歷的，還要困難。但是我們二人，倘能齊心協力，向前奮鬥，勝利還是屬於我們的！」</p>
<p>「齊心協力！齊心協力！」約翰重覆地念着。他們二入從此以後，齊心協力地向前奮鬥着。一年又一年，直到名譽恢復重見天日。約翰的聲望，比從前還要大。約翰幾年來，已做了參議院的議員。但是，幾年以來，約翰因爲昕夕從公，所以伉儷之情反見生疏了。約翰明知曼麗心中早已藴藏着恐懼與痛苦，於是他就决定不再繼任參議員。願以殘餘之天年，補救愛妻的員失。</p>
<p>可是現在當前又生了障碍與仇敵。這些障碍仇敵，不是别人，就是他們自己的兒女。他們倚仗了父母一生奮鬥的結果，坐享安樂。父母年老了，他們還爲了自私自利之心，不放父母退休。所以約翰將他不再繼任參議員的意思宣佈了，一班兒女們爭吵着，抗辯着，反對約翰之脫離政界。約翰看了這種樣子，心中很生氣，他說：「你們眞使我們厭煩了」！</p>
<p>一班兒女，面面相覻，覺得驚奇的很。曼麗連忙向她的兒女解釋道：「孩子們，你們不要誤會你們父親的意思。我們幾十年和你們朝夕相共，怎能捨得你們呢。但是我們半生的靈魂，都用在你們身上，現在你們都長大成人，可以自立了，我們不能不要回我們的靈魂。」「母親」，那大兒子威廉說：「我簡捷不明白你說的話」。</p>
<p>「你們不會明白的。我們有我們的秘密」。約翰代曼麗答道。」</p>
<p>「秘密」？那第二個兒子羅伯警異萬分的說道。「對我們亦有什麽秘密的嗎」？</p>
<p>「不錯的，羅伯，」曼麗向他解釋道。「我們有我們的秘密，你們不會知道的。大槪夫婦之間，都有一種秘密，爲他人所不能明瞭的。你們的父親和我當然亦有我們二人的秘密。秘密的歡悅，秘密的愛慮，可愛的秘密，可痛的秘密。惟有你們父親和我可以共同消受牠」。「來罷」，約翰向着曼麗道。他們二人就携手進了他們的臥房人外面兒女們還是吵着喊着。但是約翰與曼麗，早已秘密籌備好，從秘密的暗門溜了出去，坐了汽車到一個秘密的所在去了。（完）</p>

Those traveling with him included He Qigong, Wang Kemin, and eight or nine staff members. Huang said on the train that the Beiping Political Reorganization Committee was established during a time of military rush, and its responsibility is naturally greater. Therefore, one must not avoid hardship and do one's best. It is rumored that after he arrives in Beiping, the situation in North China will be resolved. In fact, it is difficult to make a clear judgment on the safety of Beiping, Tianjin, and north of the Yellow River. I recently heard Premier Wang personally state that the government has established an overall policy on the Japan issue and will never change it. The government will never seek compromise by abandoning the League of Nations. If we talk about conditions under subjugation, then why wait until now? My views are difficult to convey. If preparations can be made after arriving in Beiping, I intend to hold the establishment ceremony on Friday. (Special Telegram, 15th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Chairman Huang Fu of the Beiping Political Reorganization Committee arrived in Nanjing by special train on the morning of the 15th. Premier Wang of the Executive Yuan, accompanied by Chief Secretary Chu Minyi, went to the Xiaguan Station at 7:30 AM on the morning of the 15th to welcome him. Subsequently, the stationmaster reported that the locomotive suddenly broke down near Changzhou due to the addition of multiple carriages, and it would not arrive until 9:15 AM. Upon receiving the report, Wang could not wait any longer because he had to attend the Legislative Yuan's memorial week, so he personally wrote a letter in the stationmaster's office, expressing his apologies for not being able to greet him in person, and handed it to Secretary General Chu Minyi to deliver in person. Liu Chu represented him at the station to greet him, and then went to the Legislative Yuan. In addition, hundreds of people from various agencies came to the station to welcome him, which was the most grand event in recent history. The seventh police bureau rushed to dispatch more than 30 policemen to the station to maintain order. Railway police and the military police team were also fully armed and guarded strictly. At a quarter past 9:00, the train entered the platform. Chu Minyi was the first to jump onto the special train and shake hands with Huang, reporting Wang's apologies for not being able to wait any longer due to the train delay. Huang also expressed his bitterness for not being able to come to Nanjing sooner. He then got out of the car and shook hands with the welcomers one by one, stepped out of the station, and immediately boarded the car specially prepared by the Executive Yuan and rushed to the Railway Department's official residence to pay respects to Wang. Huang made a simple statement, saying that the plans for reorganizing North China's political affairs are full of complexities, which cannot be discussed in this short amount of time, nor can they be drafted in an instant. Therefore, I must wait until after arriving in Beiping to conduct a detailed investigation of the situation in all aspects, and then formulate specific reorganization measures based on the policies shown by the central government. Currently, due to the tense military situation at the front, I can only start by stabilizing the morale of the people in the rear. Chairman Wang Kemin has consulted on North China's finances several times in Shanghai, and there are roughly some solutions. As for Chairman Zhang Ji's telegram requesting to resign, I am still unaware of the details. I now intend to go and pay respects to Premier Wang to ask for instructions on everything. The internal personnel must also be determined after meeting with Premier Wang. I am only bringing two staff members. Huang wore a worsted wool suit that seemed to have been made in previous years, so the style was very old, a white broadcloth shirt, a formal stiff bow tie, and a black and white striped tie. He carried a cane and walked quite solemnly, with a short mustache below his nose. Premier Wang, considering Huang's journey to be tiring, specially hosted a dinner at noon on the 15th at Premier Wang's residence No. 1 in the Railway Department to welcome Huang and discuss various plans for reorganizing North China on the spot. It is reported that Wang intends to invite the central committee members in Beijing to attend the dinner. After Huang met with Wang, they agreed that the Beiping-Pukou through train would head north on the night of the 15th, and Pukou Station has specially prepared it for Huang.

<h3 id="e28">How to Save Beiping and Tianjin <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>— Yuan</p>
<p>The situation is critical. Japanese militarism is clearly about to launch a general attack on Beiping and Tianjin. Will our country again retreat without a fight as it did in the previous battles in Rehe? Some might say that there were battles in Rehe. The intensity of the resistance, the ferocity of the artillery fire, and the huge casualties suffered by officers and soldiers were reported daily in the newspapers. How can it be said that there were no battles? However, they advanced while we retreated, A attacked while B did not assist, and a small number of unplanned and uncoordinated troops were used to resist the entire enemy with unified command and ample resources. Such a battle is equivalent to no battle, and such a defeat and retreat is equivalent to a retreat without a battle. Today's intellectuals, dignitaries, and celebrities all recognize this kind of resistance as a meaningless sacrifice. It is indeed true that our people also recognize it as meaningless. However, what about a meaningful sacrifice? They hesitate and respond by saying, "This solution is really difficult to implement." Alas, the situation has reached this point. The illness is so severe that it is almost certain to be fatal. Will we continue to administer this meaningless old remedy for the sake of fulfilling our duty, because there is no particularly effective prescription? Or will we even begrudge this meaningless sacrifice and sit still and await death?</p>
<p>The illness of China today is not truly without an effective remedy. What today's intellectuals, dignitaries, and celebrities call "this solution is difficult to implement" is not truly without a solution either. They have a solution but dare not implement it. In our opinion, there are two so-called effective solutions. One is to use gentle and soothing medicine, hoping to alleviate the current temporary danger. However, the root of the illness remains, and there is still the danger of relapse at any moment. The other is to use strong purgative medicine. Although it may seem dangerous at present and very painful temporarily, the illness will change and the old disease will be cured. Afterwards, with nourishment and conditioning, the original energy will not be difficult to restore. However, the former, although it may seem to have immediate effect, is ultimately close to perfunctory and evasive, and the patient may object. Therefore, the general intellectuals, dignitaries, and celebrities, although they recognize it as meaningful, dare not implement it. The latter, however, is considered too dangerous, and they fear that the patient cannot endure this pain. They dare not recognize it as meaningful and rashly prescribe this medicine. Apart from these two solutions, there is really no other magical and inconceivable remedy. Therefore, this kind of unplanned and uncoordinated resistance by a small number of people, although it is clearly recognized as a meaningless sacrifice, is still somewhat more comforting than not taking medicine and watching death, and it can still be used as a name for taking medicine to evade the accusations of relatives and old friends. Therefore, we can only recognize this meaningless sacrifice as the only way to resist a strong enemy.</p>
<p>However, the situation is so urgent, how can we still have the leisure to stand by and watch? No matter how thorny it is, we must determine a prescription that is "meaningful and has majority support." To obtain a prescription that is meaningful and has majority support, we must discuss which of the prescriptions prescribed by various doctors are suitable and which are not. We must thoroughly consider whether to use gentle and soothing medicine or strong purgative medicine. Only then can we obtain an appropriate direction. Gentle and soothing medicine, although it seems to have immediate effect, is actually very dangerous. Strong purgative medicine, although it seems very dangerous, is actually very effective. At this time when the illness is critical and cannot be delayed, those in charge of medicine should gather the opinions of famous doctors, weigh the pros and cons, and quickly determine a truly effective remedy to save this situation of nine deaths and one life. If there is an effective remedy, but we dare not rashly try it, and still use the old prescription of so-called "meaningless sacrifice," knowing that it is ineffective and only temporarily treating the symptoms, then it is truly no different from concealing an illness and avoiding medical treatment. In the future, the loss of Beiping and Tianjin will truly be a so-called meaningless sacrifice.</p>
<p>Since our people know that the anti-Japanese resistance in the previous battles of Rehe was meaningless, then today we should urgently rise up together for meaningful anti-Japanese resistance, and do our best for meaningful sacrifice to save Beiping and Tianjin. In essence, apart from national mobilization for resistance, what other meaningful remedy is there?</p>
<h3 id="e29">Sino-Eastern Railway Negotiations Shift to Tokyo <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>Morita's Negotiations with the Russian Side to Return Cars Yield No Results</p>
<p>Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Puppet Regime Takes the Plan to Tokyo from Changchun</p>
<p>Ostensibly, the Puppet Regime Will Purchase at a Price Determined by Japan</p>
<p>The Soviet Union Will Not Violate International Public Opinion by Recognizing the Puppet Organization</p>
<p>The Claim that Purchasing the Eastern Route Would Be Exchanged for Recognition is an Exaggerated Propaganda from the Japanese Side</p>
<p>(Changchun) Yesterday, Director Morita of the Puppet Railway Department of the Puppet Organization negotiated again with the Russian Director regarding the return of cars. The Russian side replied that the Sino-Eastern Railway issue is being discussed for sale between our government and the Japanese government. As for the so-called return of cars, I have not received any instructions and cannot respond. Morita angrily believed that Kuji was also useless and rushed back to Changchun from Harbin at night to ask for instructions from the Kwantung Army Headquarters. (15th, Hualian Telegram)</p>
<p>(Changchun) (Puppet) Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of Manchukuo, Ohashi Tadaichi, left Changchun at 9:00 a.m. today via Korea for Tokyo regarding the major talks between Russia, Japan, and Manchukuo. He carried the decision of Manchukuo and went to Tokyo, where he will begin important negotiations with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Soviet Ambassador to Japan. It is expected that the joint committee plan will be concretized, and the issue of purchasing the Sino-Eastern Railway will take a sharp turn and be resolved. The content of the highest policy of Manchukuo carried by Deputy Minister Ohashi is said to be roughly as follows: (1) In principle, the Sino-Eastern Railway will be purchased by Manchukuo. The purchase price and payment method will be decided upon careful negotiation between Japan and Manchukuo. (2) An agreement must be signed on the issue of the Joint Committee of Russia, Japan, and Manchukuo to prevent the danger of border conflicts between Russia and Manchukuo, but the opinions of the Soviet Union must be solicited and the borders of the Heilongjiang River, the borders of Man-Manli, and the borders of Suifen should be established. (3) Although the Russian side has proposed the signing of a non-aggression treaty, Manchukuo's policy towards Russia will not be changed. (14th, Dentong Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) A foreign telegram on the 13th reported that the Soviet Ambassador to Japan met with Japanese Foreign Minister Uchida and stated that if the puppet organization purchased the Sino-Eastern Railway, the Soviet Union would recognize it. According to observations from diplomatic circles, although the Soviet Union has made repeated concessions to Japan and sought complete compromise, and has in fact made various contacts with the puppet organization, the claim that the Soviet Union would use the recognition of the puppet organization as an exchange condition for the sale of the Sino-Eastern Railway is clearly an exaggeration by the Japanese side. After the League of Nations unanimously passed the non-recognition of the puppet organization, the Soviet Union would not violate the public opinion of the whole world by immediately recognizing the puppet organization. (15th, Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) After Russian Foreign Minister Litvinov announced that Russia was preparing to sell the Sino-Eastern Railway, our Ministry of Foreign Affairs submitted a serious protest on the 13th, which has not yet been answered. According to outside sources, Karakhan replied to Ambassador Yan on the 9th that Russia had no intention of selling the Sino-Eastern Railway. On the 11th, Li made a completely contradictory statement. The reason for this is that Karakhan and Li have different opinions. Li is not very clear about the situation in the Far East and the interests of selling the railway. Since Li made the statement about selling the railway, the dispatches and comments sent by the diplomatic personnel of various countries stationed in Russia on this matter have been detained by the Russian government. (15th, Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Harbin) In view of the fact that bandits are still rampant in the eastern section of the Sino-Eastern Railway, the Director of the Sino-Eastern Railway has instructed the Railway Bureau that night trains shall not be operated on that section in the future. Therefore, vehicles traveling to and from Suifen River are currently suspended at Hengdaohezi at night. (15th, Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Harbin) On the 8th, Manchukuo suddenly reassigned important Manchu officials of the Sino-Eastern Railway to refresh the lineup. The three directors, Jin Rongzhi, Shao Lin, and Deputy Director Zhong Mochun, were dismissed, and Zhang Xi and Dou Shulin were appointed as new directors, and Zhang Mingzhe was appointed as Deputy Director. After the Manchu side issued the order, a joint meeting of directors and supervisors was held to request the Russian side to agree to the latest reassignment. The number of officials reached 24. The future activities of the newly appointed officials are quite noteworthy. (Japanese United Press News)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) In response to inquiries from foreign newspaper reporters, the Soviet Ambassador to Japan, Yurenev, declared that the sale of the Sino-Eastern Railway is a minor issue. The Soviet proposal to sell the Sino-Eastern Railway should be regarded as a new proposal made by the Soviet Union to Japan to establish proper relations between Japan and Russia, and as an opportunity for the two countries to approach each other.

<p>For the Use of the Second Five-Year Plan, All Workers in the Country Must Subscribe</p>
<p>The Movement to Recognize the United States is Again in Full Swing, with Plans to First Conclude a Favorable Trade Agreement with Russia</p>
<p>(Moscow) The Central Executive Committee and the People's Committee of the Soviet Government issued an order today deciding to issue a public debt of 3 billion rubles to be repaid in ten years for the construction of the Second Five-Year Plan. (14th, Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Moscow) The Soviet government announced today that it will raise an internal debt of 3 billion rubles. According to the debt-raising regulations, all workers and state employees who receive salaries are expected to contribute at least three weeks' salary to the internal debt before the deadline of October 1. This debt is due on October 1, 1943, with an interest rate of 1%. However, it can also be repaid in advance through quarterly lotteries. It is said that this money will be used to expand the government's construction plans and enhance the government's credit. (14th, Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Washington) Although the issue of the United States joining the International Court of Justice has been temporarily shelved, the issue of recognizing Soviet Russia is currently being processed in the Senate. Since the news of the Soviet Russia raising an internal debt of 3 billion rubles reached the United States, the recognition issue has changed from dormancy to activity. Today, several Democratic senators anticipate that Senator Borah, who has been the strongest advocate for recognition, will submit a proposal to the Senate. According to his friends, the President is prepared to submit a recognition proposal before Congress adjourns. Experts within the State Department have also prepared a report on the possibility of trade with Russia in the next fiscal year. Recently, several lower-level officials of the State Department deeply believe that some of the internal debt raised by Soviet Russia may be used to purchase machinery in the United States. In the past, this type of trade was obtained by Britain and Germany, but in the future, it may be transferred to the American industrial sector. Therefore, the recognition issue has become more prevalent again due to the news of Soviet Russia raising debt. According to reliable sources, the American recognition movement was only delayed because of the recent signs of a break between Russia and Japan over the Sino-Eastern Railway. Borah has investigated the attitude of the senators and has a majority in favor of recognition, as long as a favorable trade agreement can be obtained before fully restoring diplomatic relations.

<p>Incompatible with Internal Opinions, Succeeded by Shigemitsu Mamoru, Who Was Mutilated</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Deputy Foreign Minister Arita suddenly submitted his resignation. The cabinet meeting today decided to appoint Shigemitsu Mamoru, the former ambassador to China, as his successor. (15th, Dentong News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Arita's resignation is said to be due to physical discomfort. As for the truth, it is said that after withdrawing from the League of Nations, his opinions on the diplomatic situation were incompatible with some hard-line factions within the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Not only could he not implement his own beliefs, but there was also an anti-Arita situation within the ministry. Remaining in office was very painful, so he resigned. Foreign Minister Uchida deeply understood this pain and recommended the ambassador to Turkey as his successor. However, Arita intended to rest and sever ties with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, so he rejected the Foreign Minister's consolation and expressed his resignation. (15th, Dentong News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The newly appointed Deputy Foreign Minister Shigemitsu told reporters today, "I only have one leg. Whether I can undertake the important diplomatic tasks of this extraordinary period is still questionable. But I will never grow another leg at any time. My life was once in danger. This time, I offer my life to the emperor and the country. I can be satisfied." (15th, Japanese United News Agency Telegram)</p>

<p>The London Conference is Bound to Fail | Sharp Observations from Russian Newspapers | Britain, America, and France Seem to Consistently Support Japan</p>
<p>(Moscow) The Pravda newspaper here published an editorial today titled "From Washington to London," discussing the recent conference held in Washington and the World Economic Conference to be held in London next month. The newspaper first stated that the United States' abandonment of the gold standard has knocked the tool of dumping out of the hands of the British Conservative Party. Therefore, on the eve of the Economic Conference, the economic war between Britain and the United States has already taken a sharp form. Since the Great War, the antagonism between Britain and the United States has not reached such intensity and sharpness. Currently, Britain has taken urgent steps to conclude business agreements with Germany, Denmark, and Argentina, with the purpose of ensuring the minimum amount of exports of British goods to these countries. At the same time, the United States uses the war debt issue as its most powerful weapon. The United States now needs allies to stabilize its power in Europe while dealing with the situation in the Far East. The antagonism between Japan and the United States in the Far East has taken a particularly sharp form. However, in the talks between Roosevelt, MacDonald, and Herriot, Britain's attitude towards the Far East issue seems to have consistently supported the aggressors. The newspaper went on to say that the future World Economic Conference will be the same as the Geneva Conference, that is, each side will use the words of pretended peace to cover up the fierce competition of their general staffs. In addition to economic infighting, the preparation of the British and American naval and military forces will also advance in competition. The newspaper concluded that the first act of the Washington Conference has failed. Now they have moved their conference to London, where they will use the fog of the British Isles to cover up their impending conflicts. However, the London Conference is unlikely to succeed. The result will only be an intensification of opposition and conflict. (14th, TASS Telegram)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Huang Musong, the Commissioner for Xinjiang, has decided to first send his entourage, Gao Changzhu and Ai Sha, by plane on the 16th. The New Aviation Company needs to transport gasoline to Lanzhou, which will not arrive until the 17th. Therefore, Gao and Ai have now been postponed to depart on the 17th and will also carry the orders of Chairman Lin and Director Wang. Huang Musong's own proclamation stated briefly that the new province is a barrier to the northwest, with a vast territory, obstructed transportation, and the people's sentiments cannot be conveyed to the upper levels. Misunderstandings have arisen and disputes have occurred. Among the local officials, some may not have been able to fully understand the Central Government's good intentions, and the measures taken have not been appropriate, leading to misunderstandings and the creation of disputes, which have ultimately led to the devastation of the local area and the suffering of the people. The Central Government is deeply concerned about this incident and has specially ordered Musong to comfort them. From the beginning of my appointment, I will carry out the spirit of love of the Premier and the peaceful intentions of the Central Government to resolve all disputes, eliminate bad politics, and bring the people out of the mire and onto the seat of comfort, without any more misunderstandings. At this time when the national crisis is urgent and foreign insults are pressing, if brothers quarrel, it will not only be a laughingstock to foreign countries, but it may also lead to the disaster of the destruction of the province and the country.

<p>The Convention on Limiting Narcotic Drugs to be Implemented on July 9, Establishing an International Mechanism to Supervise the Manufacturing of Each Contracting State</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Chairman of the League of Nations' Anti-Smoking Committee, Bourgeois, issued a memorandum stating that the prohibition of smoking is a difficult and arduous struggle because international private trafficking groups have strong forces. According to investigations, one of these groups was able to profit up to 150,000 pounds in less than half a year. The International Convention on the Limitation of the Manufacture of Narcotic Drugs is a new weapon. The purpose of this convention is not only to bind each country with mutual obligations, but also to organize a real international administration to supervise and supervise the economic relations between the contracting states. Limiting manufacturing includes three main issues: (1) stipulating the quantity of legitimate uses of narcotic drugs in various countries in the world; (2) allocating a certain amount of raw materials to manufacturing countries; (3) allocating to consuming countries according to the number of legitimate needs, and not exceeding the amount. The memorandum also stated that economic panic and the world's economic relations really need to be organized. The new convention on limiting the manufacture of narcotic drugs stipulates layers from raw materials to finished products and is the first model of the world's economic organization. We are thus reminded that the manufacture and sale of arms can also be modeled in this way. The League of Nations Secretariat will publish an important memorandum on this issue this week.

<p>At the National Government's Memorial Week</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The National Government held a memorial week for the Premier on the morning of the 15th. Ju Zheng, Chen Shaokuan, Lin Xiang, Wei Huai, Chen Jiliang, and other civil and military officials of the various Yuan, departments, and commissions attended. Ju Zheng, the chairman, led the ceremony as usual and reported on the Soviet Union's sale of the Sino-Eastern Railway. According to the Sino-Russian and Feng-Russian agreements, the Sino-Eastern Railway should be redeemed with Chinese capital. The future of the Sino-Eastern Railway can only be decided by China and Russia, and no third party is allowed to interfere. However, recently, Japan instigated the puppet state to make things difficult for the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union initially argued on the basis of reason, but recently it has recognized and directly negotiated with the puppet state, willing to sell the Sino-Eastern Railway for 80 million Japanese yen. China and Russia have only resumed diplomatic relations for a few months. The League of Nations is drafting a report on not recognizing the puppet organization, but the Soviet Union has disregarded the Sino-Russian agreement and sold the Sino-Eastern Railway. We cannot but regret this. The Soviet Union's diplomatic stance has always been against the imperialist policy of aggression. Now the puppet state is created by Japan alone, and no member state of the League of Nations will recognize it. The puppet state has not yet become an independent country in the international community. Now the Soviet Union is willing to abandon the original railway contract provisions and sell the Sino-Eastern Railway to a third party, even at the expense of tearing up its own position and joining hands with the imperialists. Its significance is very great. It has only been a short time since China and Russia resumed diplomatic relations, but the joy of diplomacy has become a heartbreaking illusion. But we must not be discouraged or disappointed. Our only way out is to work hard ourselves and not rely on others at all. Therefore, on the one hand, we should prevent the Soviet Union from selling the Sino-Eastern Railway according to the agreement. On the other hand, we should strive to become stronger, unite from top to bottom, and cure the weakness and stagnation ourselves. We must strive for self-reliance and never again make the illusion of relying on others to prolong our lives. Then our country may be saved. (15th, Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<h3 id="e47">Central Memorial Week: Shi Qingyang Reports on Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central Government held its 78th Memorial Week at 8:00 AM on the 15th. Ye Chucang, Wang Qi, Ma Chaojun, Li Ciwen, and approximately 600 other staff members attended. Chairman Ju Zheng presided, and Shi Qingyang delivered a report. He stated that, apart from the coastline, every region along China's borders, from the Three Eastern Provinces through Mongolia, Tibet, Xinjiang, Yunnan, and Guangxi, borders strong neighbors.  These regions lack national defense infrastructure and the people are poorly educated, creating a truly perilous situation.  Mongolia's political organization has distinct characteristics. It is governed militarily, with people of a certain age incorporated into banners under the command of a Zuoling (Captain) or Canling (Major), headed by a Zhasake-style chief administrator. Several banners form a "Jian" or "Bu," with a Jianzhang (Director) or Deputy Jianzhang to oversee them. "Menggong" (League Chiefs) are publicly elected, while banner chiefs are hereditary.  Tibet is governed by religion, with the Dalai Lama holding supreme power. Under him are four "Gabulun" (Cabinet Ministers) managing various affairs. Local areas are divided into sixty-eight "Zong" (districts), each with a "Yingguan" (Military Officer) managing general affairs. Major events in Tibet must be decided through conferences of the three major monasteries: Bipeng, Sera, and Gadan.  Mongol and Tibetan society is divided into monks, nobles, commoners, and slaves.  Virtually all Mongols and Tibetans are Buddhist.  Historically, Mongols and Tibetans valued plunder and warfare, rewarding warriors. Brave and intelligent men invariably became warriors.  Buddhist teachings prohibit killing, and the great virtues, scholarship, and profound understanding of eminent monks transformed these murderous and warlike warriors into compassionate and benevolent lamas.  Through the support of successive Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties, the Mongol and Tibetan peoples have become gentle and amicable.  The Qing dynasty's governance of Mongolia and Tibet was based on the principle of "respecting their religion, not altering their customs; standardizing their administration, not changing what is suitable." The Lifan Yuan (Court of Colonial Affairs) was established to oversee tributes and imperial ceremonies. Generals and governors were stationed in Mongolia to supervise the leagues and banners, while vice-resident ministers were stationed in Tibet to oversee major events.  Great lamas and princes were treated favorably to maintain their dignity.  Our Party and our late Premier taught that all domestic groups should be treated equally to create a single, great Chinese nation.  Therefore, the Central Government's policy toward Mongolia and Tibet emphasizes peaceful solutions, expanding opportunities for Mongolians and Tibetans to participate in government, encouraging their youth to study, and treating religious leaders and princes with respect, all aimed at supporting Mongolia and Tibet. The Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission, following these guidelines, is working on popularizing education, liberating slaves, improving the organization of leagues and banners to give people the opportunity to participate in politics, and establishing various production organizations to improve people's livelihoods and skills.  These plans have been under consideration for years, but progress has been limited due to funding issues.  However, within our means, we have sent representatives to comfort officials in the Chahar and Suiyuan Leagues. We have established a Tibetan Refugee Relief Association in Beiping, requested funds from the Central Government, and solicited donations from charities to help refugees returning from Outer Mongolia.  We have also consulted on halting the cultivation of banner lands, relocated the Beiping office to Zhangjiakou, promoted the establishment of a province in Xikang, and continued the peaceful resolution of the Tibetan issue. The situation in Mongolia and Tibet is extremely serious.  However, Qingyang believes that two points are even more serious: firstly, the gradual weakening of the old forces and the disunity of the new forces.  In recent years, due to the instability of the environment and life, and the agitation of new trends, not only have the respected princes gradually lost the sympathy of the people, but even the sacred and dignified lamas have gradually lost their faith.  Youth, except for a portion coming to Beijing and Beiping for study, mostly study in India and London in Tibet, in Turkey and the Soviet Union in Xinjiang, and in Inner Mongolia many youths flee to Outer Mongolia.  Due to their different educations, their views differ greatly upon their return. This is truly a concern for national defense. In the future, reforming the old forces and guiding the new forces will be the core of the Central Government's governance of the frontier.  Border defense requires stationing troops and building fortifications, but it is impossible to have a sound social organization without integrating the local people with the people of the interior, eliminating racial and regional prejudice, and fostering a sense of shared hatred towards the enemy, even elite troops will be useless. Furthermore, people in the border areas are prone to suspicion, so those managing border affairs should possess firm perseverance and great magnanimity, avoiding greed for quick gains and short-sightedness, and focusing on the country's long-term plan. Advancing in this way, one will inevitably face slander in one's lifetime, but one's achievements will be seen after death. This is what Qingyang offers to all comrades.

<p>(Nanchang) The Provincial Party Headquarters held an expanded Memorial Week this morning at 10:00 AM, attended by several hundred people including party, government, and military officials such as Xiong Shihui. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek gave instructions, stating that the violent Japanese are desperately attacking North China, and our soldiers are resisting with their blood and flesh. The fighting is extremely fierce. He asked how the entire country should rouse itself to jointly face the national crisis, especially as Jiangxi is still in the midst of intense communist suppression efforts. The support work should be done with utmost effort. The bandits have only six counties left, with an estimated fifty thousand people in each county, for a total of no more than three hundred thousand. After years of casualties and desertion, the remaining bandits number less than sixty thousand. Suppressing the communists is not a problem. It should be understood that suppressing the communists is an organizational and total war, with military force accounting for one-third and politics accounting for two-thirds. He hoped that all sectors would work hard and quickly overcome the national crisis and eliminate the communist bandits. (Special dispatch, 15th)</p>

<p>Papen Refutes British War Secretary's Remarks, Will Lodge Strong Protest with Austria, and Has Tariff Conflict with Hungary</p>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, 14th - Former German Prime Minister and current Deputy Prime Minister Papen gave a speech today at a joint demonstration held by representatives of the National Socialist Party and the Steel Helmet League in Meins, refuting the recent remarks made by British War Secretary Hailsham in the House of Lords. He said that it was outrageous for the War Secretary of a country to issue words about punishment. They personally congratulated him in Lausanne, believing that the delusion that military sanctions could force payment has already died. Now the War Secretary wants to impose sanctions in the League of Nations on a country that is only fighting against immoral treaties, while the League of Nations has taken no action against countries that resort to force and wage war. What hypocrisy! The War Secretary obviously does not know this. He, who still yearns for the political system of the French Revolution, does not know that the new Germany is actually opposed to the escapist's struggles, and should not be regarded as a desire to lean towards war. The escapist's writing wants to highlight the doctrine that those who die on the battlefield do not deserve their death. It should be known that a man's duty to go to the battlefield is like a woman's duty to be a mother. To gain eternal enjoyment, individual sacrifices are indispensable.</p>
<p>Reuters, Vienna, 14th - Germany will lodge a strong diplomatic protest with Austria because the Austrian authorities treated the National Socialist Party delegation led by Dr. Frank with disdain. When the National Socialist Party delegation arrived in Vienna, many people welcomed them, but Austrian officialdom did not welcome their arrival. Austrian Chancellor Dr. Dollfuss spoke strongly, saying that Austria would not accept foreign interference, and the police chief also clearly stated to the National Socialist Party representatives that their visit to Vienna was not genuinely desired by Austrian officialdom.</p>
<p>Havas, Vienna, 14th - Bavarian Minister of Justice Frank, who is visiting Austria, hosted representatives of the foreign press at the German embassy, excluding the French press. Frank declared that the German cabinet ministers had been insulted by the Austrian government upon their arrival in Vienna and would not remain silent. The German government will lodge a protest. Although Frank did not specify the nature of the protest, it is generally speculated that it will involve diplomatic action.</p>
<p>Havas, Vienna, 14th - Prussian Minister of Justice Kerl and other National Socialist Party representatives visiting Austria returned to Germany by plane today. Only Bavarian Minister of Justice Frank remained in Austria. Frank has now departed for the city of Graz in southern Austria.</p>
<p>Havas, Budapest, Hungary, 15th - A tariff conflict between Germany and Hungary is imminent. Germany previously imposed high protectionist taxes on grain, milk, livestock, eggs, vegetables, and fruits imported from Hungary, and is now implementing the same measures on Hungarian oils. This measure would effectively ban all Hungarian exports to Germany. Hungarian sources criticize this move, saying that Germany has granted various benefits to the Netherlands, Belgium, and the Baltic states, while discriminating against Hungary, which violates the most-favored-nation clause. Hungary has dispatched a delegation to Berlin to discuss this matter.</p>

<p>Over 20,000 Pounds of Milk Dumped on the Roadside, Police Use Tear Gas to Disperse the Crowd</p>
<p>"National" News, Milwaukee, 14th - Although Farmer Strike Federation Chairman Le Jiao had given an order to indefinitely postpone the strike, today countless farmers waited before dawn on the main roads outside the city, waiting for the milk trucks carrying large quantities of fresh milk from the milk market to come in a steady stream. They immediately held out their canes and intercepted each truck, dumping 25,000 pounds of milk on the roadside. When half of the milk had been dumped, the police arrived and fired tear gas, but because there were few tear gas grenades and many farmers, they were unable to stop them and had to allow the farmers to dump all the milk. When it was all dumped and the large police force had also arrived, the farmers dispersed one after another. Most of them had come in their own cars. It is reported that Rino had sent a telegram to twenty states on Friday, postponing the strike to give the government a chance to implement rural relief. So far, except for Milwaukee, the rest of the places have been able to obey the order.</p>

<p>United News Agency, Tokyo, 15th - At 7:00 PM on this day last year, young military officers and the Farmers' Death Squad assassinated key political figures. Therefore, right-wing groups wanted to take advantage of this opportunity to engage in unruly behavior. Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, similar leaflets were scattered on the roof garden of the Tokyo Mitsukoshi Department Store. The Metropolitan Police Department received the news and intensified its precautions against right-wing riots. Because of the strict security, everything remained peaceful as of this morning. However, the political and financial circles are indeed very tense. The Seiyukai's movement to overthrow the cabinet seems to have subsided somewhat. It is reported that people like Tokonami and Kuhara have recently distributed statements within their party, saying that the national crisis has not been resolved and the people should not be preoccupied with party strife. The military also criticized the degenerate behavior of party politicians and opposed coups. It is reported that the Japanese government wants to observe the trends in public opinion after the announcement of the May 15th Incident before deciding on its future course.</p>

<p>A Reuters dispatch from Paris on the 15th: It appears that Britain and France will follow Hitler's lead and issue an important policy statement on Thursday. Reuters learned today from responsible sources that the US representative, Davis, who is familiar with Britain's position, has discussed with French Foreign Minister Poncet the outlines of a joint US-British-French policy. This should not be seen as a plan to jointly resist Germany, as all three countries are now eager to find a way to bring Germany's views closer to those of other nations. However, the overall situation still contains the possibility of danger, so the other powers now have no choice but to adopt a defensive posture.</p>
<p>A National Daily dispatch from Paris on the 14th: US representative to Europe, Davis, returned to Paris last night from London. He expressed the opinion that the disarmament conference has passed its most critical crisis, and there is no immediate danger of it breaking down.</p>
<p>A Reuters dispatch from Geneva on the 14th: Because fourteen countries requested that the disarmament conference postpone the discussions of the General Committee, the chairman of the disarmament conference, Henderson, has postponed the meeting from Monday to Thursday. Because the German representatives returned home to participate in the parliament, the other countries are unwilling to make any responsible statements regarding disarmament before German Chancellor Hitler's speech in the parliament on the 17th of this month. It is heard that the Little Entente countries were the most forceful in requesting the postponement of the meeting.</p>
<p>A National Daily dispatch from Paris on the 15th: Herriot, in his speech at the Radical Socialist Party Congress in Marseille today, recounted his conversations with President Roosevelt during his visit to Washington. He said that the US president firmly insists that the Geneva Disarmament Conference must proceed according to the US disarmament plan. The US president agreed to manage armaments according to the suggestions put forward by France, using methods that are stricter than those stipulated in the British plan. After talking with the president, he knew the dangers that would be caused if Germany were allowed to possess the same types of weapons as other countries. If the disarmament conference shows signs of success, the US president intends to send an observer to the conference to listen to the definition of aggressor nations. If the United States agrees with the decisions made at the conference, then the United States will abandon its long-held neutrality and protect those who are attacked. Mr. Herriot earnestly stated that the US president's attitude on this matter is extremely important, because the League of Nations Covenant Article 16 is thus able to be implemented.</p>
<p>A National Daily dispatch from London on the 15th: Although Britain does not recognize Germany's declaration of its intention to rearm as a violation of the Treaty of Versailles, if Germany's future rearmament plans exceed the limits of the treaty, the British government will consider the sanctions of the Allies to be justified. As for the nature of such sanctions, it is heard that it is currently the objective of diplomatic talks in London and Paris.</p>
<p>A National Daily dispatch from Paris on the 14th: Le Matin published an article today studying the future progress of the disarmament conference, asking what methods would be most practical if it became necessary to implement sanctions. Le Matin's conclusion is that any sanction method is extremely complex. Even implementing Article 430 of the Treaty of Versailles, occupying all or part of the Rhineland area, is no longer a problem, because the implementation of this sanction method is now restricted and weakened by the Hague Conventions. Furthermore, countries that are at risk of being invaded can vigorously implement economic sanctions, but the procedures are also very difficult.</p>

<p>Roosevelt Intends to Open Difficult Situation, Congress Still Unwilling to Consider Delaying War Debt Payments</p>
<p>US Sends Politicians to Participate in Economic Conference</p>
<p>A Reuters dispatch from Washington on the 14th: Washington authorities are now closely watching the events in Geneva. It is widely believed that the Geneva events will be the key to the debt problem. If the Geneva Disarmament Conference has satisfactory results, then President Roosevelt will definitely take action with Congress before the European countries' debt payments are due in June. If a method of extending and delaying payments is indeed necessary for the success of the disarmament conference, then the US President is prepared to overcome opposition in Congress and request the necessary power to approve the extension of debt payments. However, France opposes repaying the debt due last December that was not paid without obtaining a guarantee of extending and delaying payments. And the US Congress is absolutely unwilling to consider extending the repayment period when the debt is not paid. This is a kind of difficulty encountered by President Roosevelt.</p>
<p>A Reuters dispatch from New York on the 14th reported that the US delegation to the World Economic Conference will have two politicians of established reputation, in order to ensure that political problems do not endanger the future of the World Economic Conference. Secretary of State Hull is satisfied with the current talks in Washington. He hopes that within a period of two months, a general agreement can be reached on common problems.</p>

<p>Paraguayan Representative Argues Declaration of War Did Not Violate Covenant</p>
<p>No Major Battles on Chaco Front</p>
<p>A Havas dispatch from Geneva on the 15th: The Council of the League of Nations met at 10:30 this morning to discuss the dispute between Bolivia and Paraguay. First, the chairman of the Council, Mr. Cerruti of Italy, reported on the process, and then the Bolivian representative, Mr. Reyes, stated that at this time, the Neutral Nations Committee was restarting reconciliation, but Paraguay actually declared war on Bolivia, causing the reconciliation process to be broken. He asked the Council to judge where the final responsibility lies. The Paraguayan representative, Mr. Pedoya, then reviewed the peace proposals put forward by the Paraguayan government on February 25 of this year, Bolivia's reply, and the intervention of the Washington Neutral Nations Committee. He said that Bolivia took every opportunity during the truce of negotiations to increase its military force and attack Paraguay. The Paraguayan representative then read out the notes from the governments of Argentina and Chile to Bolivia. Finally, he said that Paraguay did not initiate the war, and that the war had long existed in fact. Paraguay is now continuing to accept arbitration or legal resolution, and clarified that Paraguay has not violated the clauses of the League of Nations Covenant, so the sanctions of Article 16 of the Covenant cannot be applied.</p>
<p>A National Daily dispatch from the Paraguayan capital on the 14th: A communique from the Paraguayan Ministry of the Army stated that Bolivian troops attempted to carry out an encircling operation in the northern sector of the Chaco front. Their first attempt was repelled by the Paraguayan army. The south and central sectors of the front have not seen much fighting, but there have been signs of aircraft attacks. It is noted that the heat of the sun has slightly decreased and the rainy season has also passed, and the front line can begin a major battle. However, the Bolivian army only has small attacks, which is quite strange. Only because the Bolivian government has threatened to bomb the Paraguayan capital, the people here are still quite panicked.</p>

<h3 id="e93">Japanese Colonial Ministry's Immigration Plan Aims to Completely Colonize Manchuria <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>Jointly Operated Agricultural Development Company by Japan and Manchukuo, Mass Immigration with Capital of 20 Million Yuan, Implementing Group Indoctrination</p>
<p>Tokyo Nichi Nichi Shimbun reported on the 9th that the newly established immigration company, mainly for Manchurian immigrants, recently consulted with the leaders of the Colonial Ministry several times while Lieutenant General Shaoji, Chief of Staff of the Kwantung Army, was staying in Tokyo. The two sides have reached a consensus and decided that Japan and "Manchukuo" will jointly operate the Manchurian Agricultural Development Company with a fixed capital of 20 million yuan. The Colonial Ministry plans to exert the full power of the agricultural land company to massively transfer free agricultural immigrants and develop various industrial immigrants. The Management Bureau will formulate specific plans. The outline is to set 100,000 families, 500,000 people, in units of five-person families, and immigrate within 10 to 15 years. After immigrating to Manchuria, group indoctrination will be implemented under the supervision of the Kwantung Army. New immigrant training centers will be established in four places: Harbin, Fengtian, Gongzhuling, and Xiongyuecheng. The Kwantung Army Special Service Department, the Colonial Ministry, and the Governor-General of Korea, and other immigration-related authorities and technical officials discussed the immigration policy to Manchuria at the Special Service Department Conference Room in Changchun on the 7th, establishing specific plans. First, a joint immigration agricultural land investigation committee will be opened to discuss the problems of controlling and contacting immigrant organizations in Manchuria, the problem of distributing immigrants to Korea, the problem of defending immigrant areas, the establishment and investigation of the Manchurian Agricultural Land Development Company, etc. As a result, specialists will organize an immigrant investigation team, with the Colonial Ministry dispatching two people, and the Governor-General of Korea, the Kwantung Government, the Kwantung Army, Manchuria, and the South Manchuria Railway each dispatching one person to organize the first team, led by engineer Nakamura, to depart from Jilin northward on the 10th with the protection of the Jilin army to investigate. On the 12th, a second team, led by engineer Kato, was organized to depart to the south of Jilin Province. The third team will investigate the Fengtian area from the 20th.</p>
<p>Also, according to the Tokyo Asahi Shimbun, the current president of the South Manchuria Railway, Mr. Hatta, is currently secretly plotting with various parties in the Japanese government in Tokyo to carry out the immigration business to our four eastern provinces in order to achieve the complete colonization of Manchuria. Recently, Hatta has concluded discussions with the Colonial Ministry authorities on this issue and will meet with all parties to further discuss specific implementation plans. The main content of his plan is to organize a Manchurian Agricultural Land Development Company and set up an investment agency with capital of 30 million to 40 million yuan. The company will use 20 million yuan of capital to purchase farmland in Manchuria to await the free immigration of Japanese people. A system of self-cultivating farmers will be created through the fifteen-year installment method, requiring the accommodation of a total of 200,000 families, with an agricultural immigrant population of one million. The plan will be included in the Colonial Ministry's new business in next year's budget. The newspaper also reported that the Colonial Ministry's second armed immigrant trip to Manchuria has already selected 700 qualified people from 18 prefectures and counties throughout Japan, including Tohoku, Hokuriku, Chubu, and Kanto. Another exam will be given on the 15th of this month, and 500 people will be selected to be transferred to the army factory in Gunma Prefecture to implement emergency military training. It is scheduled to depart for Manchuria in early July. The Japanese call them the avant-garde immigrants.</p>

<p>Fierce Bloodshed at Nantianmen for Days, Heavy Casualties on Both Sides, Enemy Troops East of Luan River Have Crossed River to Invade West, Intense Fighting</p>
<p>Enemy Planes Bomb Everywhere, Disrupting Our Rear</p>
<p>A special dispatch from Peiping: The Japanese army is actively plotting to disrupt Tianjin and Peiping, scheming to shake our northern military base to achieve the first step of their dream of aggression, planning to occupy Miyun in the north and invade Luanzhou in the east, seizing the important areas around Tianjin and Peiping, and then using political methods to use traitors to launch riots in Tianjin and Peiping, responding from within and without, in one fell swoop to compensate for their long-cherished wish. Because of international relations, their method of invading Guannei cannot be the same as that of invading the three northeastern provinces, so they plan to use traitors to form another situation after occupying Tianjin and Peiping, adopting the method of using Chinese to control Chinese, so that China will once again become a north-south split situation, to reap the fisherman's benefit. To the international community, they will excuse it as Chinese people fighting among themselves and that it has nothing to do with them. Their means are truly unparalleled and cruel. They are currently carrying out the first step of their military plan, actively attacking our Luanxi and Nantianmen and other places. The fighting in various roads has been extremely fierce in recent days. Our soldiers are using their lives and fighting with the enemy, regardless of success or failure.</p>
<p>Since the enemy east of the Luan River occupied our Qian'an, Lulong, Funing, and Changli counties, there has been no active action on the railway front. They are purely using the method of flanking attacks, crossing the river upstream of the Luan River to invade the west, avoiding fighting along the Beining line to avoid causing international attention. Since the 11th, the Japanese puppet troops in Qian'an and Lulong have begun to advance into our Luanxi, using artillery, airplanes, and smoke bombs as cover to forcibly cross the river. One route sneaked across the river from the Dongzhai and Xizhai area near Qian'an to Renzikou and Gaotaizi. Another route built a bridge at night from the Xixiakou northwest of Lulong to cross the river. Our Wang Yizhe's troops, and He (Lizhong) and Weng (Zhaoyuan)'s divisions did their best to resist. The fierce battle lasted all day, and the enemy did not succeed. Until yesterday (12th), the enemy used more than 60 artillery pieces and more than 10 airplanes to bombard the position violently. A part of the enemy crossed the Luan River in the Renzikou area and advanced to Renzikou and Gaotaizi, and Wang Guanying, which is 80 miles away from Fengrun. At the same time, at 11:00 a.m. yesterday, more than 1,500 enemies in the Lulong area also used more than 30 artillery pieces and 5 large airplanes to violently bombard the covering infantry to forcibly cross the river and rushed to the Shaheyi area, which is 40 miles away from Luanzhou, and engaged in a fierce battle with our army. Gunfire was clearly heard in Leizhuang and Guye. At 2:00 p.m., Weng Zhaoyuan personally led reinforcements to repel the enemy.</p>
<p>This morning, fierce battles took place in Sunluozhuang and Wang Guanying, which are 60 miles away from Shaheyi. The enemy troops planned to divide into two routes to raid Luanzhou. This morning, our army sent a large number of reinforcements to block. As of press time, the battle is still going on. The situation in that area is extremely critical. The telegrams from Shen Ke and Wang Yizhe reporting the battle situation are recorded below. Shen's telegram (titles omitted): The enemy in the Dongzhai and Xizhai area is confronting a part of our army across the river. At night, the enemy's plainclothes team repeatedly sneaked across the river to Renzikou and Gaotaizi. This morning (12th) at dawn, the enemy used more than 60 artillery pieces and 6 airplanes to cover its infantry of about 5 to 600 people to forcibly cross the river to Renzikou and Gaotaizi. The two sides fought fiercely. A part of the enemy has been forcibly crossed the river and is now fighting fiercely with our Xie's troops. I have now sent powerful troops to vow to wipe out the enemy in one fell swoop. At the time of hearing, Shen Kewen (12th) printed. Wang's telegram (titles omitted): At 5:00 this morning (12th), the enemy launched a general offensive on the entire line and built a military bridge overnight at the Luan River ferry at Xixiakou on the front of our certain division. At dawn, the enemy armored vehicle attempted to cross and was destroyed by our artillery fire. The enemy still attempted to repair it. The two sides fought in artillery. At the same time, the enemy crossed the river from the Changlingfeng, Dongzhai, and Xizhai areas on the front of our left-wing friendly army's certain division. That side fell into chaos. Fortunately, our certain division's left flank was harassed and attacked by the enemy, and we sent powerful troops to defend it early. They are all in a bitter battle. I heard Yu Yizhe's article (12th) at noon.</p>
<p>On the Gubeikou side, since our army abandoned the Nantianmen position, the front line is at Daxiao Xinkailing, the right flank is at Daohuangyu, and the left flank is at Shangdianzi. The enemy army launched a general offensive on the 10th, dividing into routes from Nantianmen and Heilongtan to bombard our position with artillery and airplanes, followed by infantry charges. The fierce battle has been going on for days, with more than 2,000 casualties on both sides. Our Liu division suffered heavy losses, and one part was transferred back for reorganization, and another army was transferred to resist. The battle has been fierce day and night for the past two days, and has not stopped until last night. Last night, our left and right flank positions changed slightly, and the front also withdrew to Xiaoxinkailing, Beixiangyu and other places. Since our army abandoned the Nantianmen position, there are more passes in the mountains and the front line is too long, making defense more difficult. However, our army has built multi-angle battle lines at various passes and set up defenses step by step. The front line is very solid, and the enemy has not been able to succeed despite fierce attacks. In addition to artillery and airplanes, the enemy army has also transported more than ten tanks to assist the soldiers in attacking us. Our army calmly responded and still guarded the original position. Until last night, a part of the enemy rushed from the side to a place more than ten miles north of Shixia, and engaged in a fierce battle with our certain army. Our army bravely charged and killed the enemy and repelled them. This morning (13th), the two sides are still in a stalemate. The enemy army suffered heavy losses due to fierce attacks and needs to be replenished. The battle this morning was slightly calmer than the previous two days. However, the Japanese army has sent a large number of reinforcements to Gubeikou, and there may be a more fierce battle tonight or tomorrow morning.</p>
<p>Enemy planes have been fiercely bombing Yutian, Fengrun, Shixia, Miyun, and other places for days, dropping heavy bombs and incendiary bombs to threaten our rear. Our soldiers and civilians suffered heavy losses. In Peiping, one enemy plane came to reconnaissance and distribute absurd leaflets on the previous two days. Today, enemy planes did not come to Peiping, but only reconnoitered Niulanshan and Changping in northern Peiping. As for Miyun, Shixia, and Yutian, enemy planes were still flying back and forth dropping bombs today, which was very tragic (13th).</p>

<p>The incident occurred in No. 596, Beitou Lane, in the Second District (Jingyun City), only five or six miles from the city. There is a villager named Bao Shunsheng in the lane, whose wife Deng gave birth to three sons. The eldest son, Gui Fa, is over 30 years old, the second son, Jin Fa, is 27 years old, and the third son, Rong Fa, is 24 years old. The eldest and second sons are already married, but Rong Fa is not yet married. The three brothers divided the property in 1921. On the 11th of this month, Rong Fa had nothing to do and was suffering from sores, so he returned to his hometown to live. On the evening of the 12th, Rong Fa planned to borrow 10 yuan from Jin Fa, but Jin Fa refused. Rong Fa then demanded the return of the land deed he had lent to him before, which caused a dispute. Jin Fa became angry and punched Rong Fa. Rong Fa saw that the situation was not good and ran away. The matter subsided. Unexpectedly, at about 11:00 p.m. on the (13th) night before, Rong Fa had fallen asleep when Jin Fa suddenly sneaked into his residence, put a hemp rope around Rong Fa's neck, and strangled him hard. Rong Fa woke up and shouted for help. Jin Fa then struck his head several times with a long bench, killing him on the spot.</p>

<p>More than 1,000 workers were laid off from the Tangzha Dasheng Yarn Factory in Nantong this time. On the 12th, 8,000 registered male and female workers resumed work, causing those who were laid off to be unwilling to accept it and to cause trouble in Tangzha. On the afternoon of the 14th, the county police team arrested 17 leading figures, including Ji Degui, and escorted them to the county government. Thousands of male and female workers gathered in the city to petition the county government to release them. Military police tried to stop them without success. The workers then broke down the wooden fence that was closed on the west gate of the city and poured into the city, kneeling in front of the county government along the street. For a time, the order was in chaos, and shops on all roads closed their doors one after another. Subsequently, County Magistrate Ye persuaded them bitterly and immediately released the two elderly workers Xu Hong and Wang San who were in custody. The other 15 were instructed to be released by the trade union after submitting a guarantee. The workers then dispersed. At the moment, Tangzha is under special martial law due to the surging labor unrest.</p>

<p>Chen Desheng from Xinghua, 18 years old, was a soldier in the 4th Company of the 1st Battalion of the 1st Division of Jiangxi. He was expelled for bad conduct. He still has parents, brothers, sisters-in-law, and siblings at home. A few days ago, he was hospitalized for treatment due to illness. After the doctor examined him and found that he was not sick, he was sent away. Chen then walked to the Nanhe River outside the New West Gate and suddenly attempted suicide by drowning. Fortunately, someone caught a glimpse of him and tried his best to rescue him, preventing him from drowning. The police officer Fan Yingyu from the station then took Chen to the branch station in charge and transferred him to the branch bureau. After questioning by the Bureau Member Ding, he ordered him to change his clothes and instructed the police to send him to the ferry bureau to be transported back to his hometown.</p>

They consoled the injured civilians on the spot and expressed their apologies. They then went to various shops to persuade them to reopen, and most shops complied and opened their doors. However, near the Dongpo Bridge, someone threw bricks at the Dacheng Swimming Equipment store, and at the same time, the signboard of the Senmao store on East Street was taken away by a rogue, resulting in no resolution and the shops closing again. At 8 PM that evening, the county chamber of commerce held another meeting, with the majority advocating for immediate reopening. An urgent notice was immediately printed and issued, ordering all shops to reopen as usual at 6 AM (on the 15th). The chamber of commerce would be responsible for handling the aftermath.

<p>The Bengbu Military Police Inspectorate of the Jinpu Railway Garrison Command recently uncovered more than twenty reactionary organizations, reactionary elements, and suspects in Bengbu. After days of interrogation, it was discovered that the key leaders were retired soldiers Ma and Yansheng. Ma was appointed by a certain party as the chief of the first battalion of the People's Anti-Japanese National Salvation Army and concurrently served as the commander-in-chief. He appointed many squadron leaders, intending to commit illegal acts under the guise of national salvation, but in reality, he was a traitor. Fortunately, the Military Police Inspectorate received an early report and immediately uncovered the plot. It was learned that Ma and others confessed to organizing six battalions and planning to collude with other traitors in Bengbu to disrupt public order. Currently, the Inspectorate has approved the release of those with lighter suspicions on bail and has decided to prepare a document to transfer the key suspects, Ma Yansheng and others, to the Xuzhou Jinpu Railway Garrison Command for trial.</p>

<p>Expiration of the Sino-Japanese Tariff Agreement</p>
<h3 id="e110">New Taxes and Surcharges to Be Levied from Today <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>Significant Differences Between Using Customs Gold Units for Calculation, Surcharges Previously Exempted Now All Levied</p>
<p>The Sino-Japanese Tariff Agreement expired yesterday (May 15th). Starting today, all imported Japanese goods will be subject to the new tariff and two additional surcharges. Yesterday, the Jianghai Customs authorities received an order from the Ministry of Finance to implement the new tariff based on customs gold units and issued a notice to levy the surcharges starting today. Details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e111">Levy of New Taxes <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>The collection of new taxes begins upon the expiration of the agreement. The difference between the tariff rates promulgated on January 1st, 1931, and those maintained by the Sino-Japanese Reciprocal Agreement is significant. Furthermore, the old agreement was calculated in silver during its effective period, while our customs have long used customs gold units for tax collection. Japanese goods have uniquely benefited from silver-based calculations, with substantial profits. At the current silver price of $1.40 per yuan, the customs gold unit requires nearly two yuan. The difference in payment significantly differs. The change to collecting new taxes in customs gold units results in a difference of about double the benefits enjoyed under the tariff agreement.</p>
<h3 id="e112">Levy of Surcharges <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance previously ordered all customs offices to levy customs surcharges and disaster relief surcharges on imported and exported goods. Imported and exported goods from all countries were subject to these surcharges. However, the Sino-Japanese Tariff Agreement stipulated in Article 3 that various surcharges were to be exempted. Therefore, Japanese goods have been able to avoid paying these surcharges in recent years. With the expiration of the agreement, this exemption naturally becomes invalid, and starting today, all surcharges will be levied on Japanese goods in accordance with the regulations.</p>
<h3 id="e113">Order from the Ministry of Finance <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>The Jianghai Customs Supervisory Office received an instruction from the Ministry of Finance, stating that, in order to implement the matter, the surcharges collected by customs were originally stipulated to be levied on import and export taxes. When the surcharges were implemented in December 1931, the attached schedule to the Sino-Japanese Agreement was still in effect. Therefore, based on Article 3 of the original regulations, various items were exempted from surcharges. However, as the attached schedule to the Sino-Japanese Agreement expired on May 15th of this year, the basis for the aforementioned exemptions no longer exists. Starting May 16th, these imported goods should be subject to surcharges to ensure uniformity. The matter has been submitted to the Executive Yuan for record, and the Customs Administration has been ordered to handle it accordingly.</p>
<h3 id="e114">Customs Notice <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>Tang Haian, the Superintendent of Jianghai Customs in this city, and Robert, the Chief Inspector of Customs, jointly issued a notice yesterday, stating that starting today, all surcharges previously exempted will be levied, including those on goods stored in customs warehouses. The original text of the notice is as follows: "Notice regarding joint issuance. Now, in accordance with the government's order, all imported goods previously exempted from customs surcharges and disaster relief surcharges (see this customs' notice dated November 27th, 1931) must be subject to both of the aforementioned surcharges starting the 16th of this month. Goods stored in customs warehouses will also be subject to these surcharges without extension. All merchants are hereby notified."</p>

<p>Ministry Representatives Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday</p>
<p>Previously, due to disputes over the smuggling of fishing salt, the Ministry of Industry specifically requested the Ministry of Finance to send representatives to a meeting in order to thoroughly resolve the issue and facilitate fishermen. After discussion, four items were resolved. Except for three items concerning palliative measures, all were jointly implemented by the two ministries to quell the disturbances. The fundamental solution, namely the denaturing and promotion of fishing salt, was of great importance. The Ministry of Industry again convened a meeting in the ministry with representatives from the coastal provincial governments and the Ministry of Finance. After discussion, it was resolved to request the Ministries of Industry and Finance to jointly appoint experts to consult with fishery organizations to formulate implementation measures for reporting and verification. Now, the Ministries of Industry and Finance have dispatched experts Li Erkang, Chen Guochen, Ye Yu, and Lan Tianyu to the Dinghai fishing area in Zhejiang to purchase various kinds of fish catches. They will conduct denaturation tests on various drug-combined denatured fishing salts to determine the standards for denatured fishing salt and study its cost. The Ministry of Industry will separately consult with the coastal provincial and municipal governments to instruct the fisheries associations in each county and city to formulate opinions based on the Ministry of Finance's regulations on fishing salt and the methods for denaturing and discoloring fishing salt for selection. The experts have arrived in Shanghai yesterday and transferred to Dinghai for on-site testing.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the Northeast Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army Support Association received a telegram from Huang Shouzhong, the commander of the First Army of the Rehe National Salvation Army, and others, requesting that the central government be urged to immediately dispatch aircraft to the north to assist in battle. The original telegram reads: (Telegraph header) "Japanese troops are invading Rehe directly and advancing rapidly, causing the loss of thousands of miles of our national border and the complete removal of our protective screen. Although there are many reasons for the military setbacks on our side, the lack of air defense is the main reason. We have no way to detect enemy military intelligence to benefit our military operations, nor can we provide guidance to our main forces to destroy their vanguard. Instead, the enemy aircraft are able to understand our military strategy, bombard our military affairs, and control our advance and retreat. Our military morale is shaken, and the local area is devastated, causing the front line to collapse before the rear is even in panic. Moreover, the areas passed by enemy aircraft are littered with corpses and ruined homes, making the scene unbearable to witness. Recalling that the foundation of our national air defense has not been established is something that everyone knows, but the prototype of the air force has already been formed. The central government and various provinces have hundreds of military aircraft, and they have also demonstrated their considerable power in previous years of internal warfare and bandit suppression. Now, in the face of large-scale war against foreign aggression, we cherish them too much and are unwilling to send them to the front to assist the military. This is tantamount to hiding our strength and allowing ourselves to be slaughtered. Thinking of this, we are extremely heartbroken. The entire nation has felt that the creation of a large-scale air force must be pursued urgently, and organizations have been established throughout the country, running around and calling for action without leaving any effort. The people's concern for the country is evident. However, the government's failure to use its air force is causing doubts, especially among the brave soldiers fighting the enemy on the front lines. Your association leads the way in the effort to create an air force. A long-term plan must be prepared in advance, but the current urgent need cannot be delayed for even a moment. We earnestly request that your association telegraph the central government and the authorities of various provinces to quickly dispatch aircraft to the front to defend against the enemy and boost our military morale. Anti-Japanese national salvation depends on this. Your association's call to action will surely resonate throughout the land. We dare to express our urgent words with sincere hearts and await your consideration. Huang Shouzhong, Commander of the First Army of the Rehe People's Anti-Japanese National Salvation Army; Zhou Han, Commander of the Independent Seventh Detachment of the First Army Corps of the Northeast Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army."</p>
<h3 id="e120">French Community Celebrates Joan of Arc Day <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>France Still Commemorates the Patriotic Heroine Who Saved the Country 500 Years Ago</p>
<p>The day before yesterday was the French Joan of Arc Day, commemorating the French maiden who dedicated herself to saving the country. The French community in this city held a grand celebration. The origin of Joan of Arc Day dates back approximately 503 years ago. Most of France was occupied by British troops, and the country's situation was critical and its morale was low. The urgent situation was no less severe than our country's situation today. In the southern region of France, there was a small town called Orleans, which had been besieged for a long time. The soldiers in the town were exhausted. Just as it was about to fall, a maiden named Joan knew her duty as a woman and mourned the sinking of her country. Relying on her religious beliefs, she gathered soldiers, inspired them with loyalty and righteousness, encouraged them with divine destiny, dispelled their fear of the enemy and desire for temporary peace, and led more than 5,000 people with incomplete weapons to fight and win. The British army lifted the siege of Orleans. From then on, the French soldiers were determined to fight, their morale was greatly boosted, and they won consecutive battles, recovering most of the lost land. Unfortunately, Joan was deceived by traitors, captured by the British army, falsely accused of being a witch, burned at the stake, and martyred. However, from then on, France was finally able to reverse the declining trend and establish the foundation for its revival. The French people remembered her heroic deeds and designated the day of her martyrdom as a national memorial day, which is observed as solemnly as the Democratic Memorial Day on July 14th. At 9 AM the day before yesterday, the French Consul General Mei Liai, accompanied by the commander of the navy and army and representatives of the French community, held a flag-raising ceremony at the consulate square. Then, at around 10 AM, they went to the Catholic Church in Yangjingbang to hold a grand mass to commemorate this patriotic heroine with an extremely solemn ceremony.</p>

<h3 id="e124">Ministry of Industry Dispatches Personnel to Shanghai to Discuss Factory Inspection Rights Case with Municipal Government and Resolve Method <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>According to the Xin Xin News Agency, the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession is attempting to seize factory inspection rights by taking advantage of the amendment to Article 34 of the annex to the Yangjingbang Regulations by the Western Taxpayers' Special Assembly. The situation has become more moderate as the municipal government negotiates with the concession authorities. The Xin Xin News Agency reporter has specially inquired about the negotiation process from reliable sources as follows:</p>
<p>The consular body indicated that when the case began to be negotiated, the consular body initially refused to budge because we had no factory inspection agency. Recently, the Ministry of Industry decided to establish a central factory inspection office within July of this year and ordered all provinces and cities to establish branch offices. The American consul and leader of the consular body, Ke Yinhai, personally visited Mayor Wu Tiecheng and expressed his willingness to compromise and proposed two principles for negotiation: (1) Our side authorizes the concession authorities to handle the matter in a flexible manner within a fixed period (one or two years) and recovers the rights after the expiration date. (2) Our side executes the inspection duties, and the concession side sends personnel to participate.</p>
<p>Ministry Personnel Arrive in Shanghai: Since the case occurred, the Ministry of Industry has specially dispatched Bao Guohua, the section chief of the fourth section of the Labor Department, to Shanghai three times in order to understand the truth and conduct negotiations. The first time was to conduct an investigation. The second time was to formulate a response plan based on the facts and consult with the municipal government on implementation methods. The third time was to approve a telegram from the municipal government stating that it would hold a meeting with the concession authorities to negotiate a compromise method. He also came to Shanghai to discuss everything. Recently, the concession authorities have expressed their sincerity to compromise. The municipal government then telegraphed the Ministry of Industry again to report everything. After receiving the telegram, the Ministry of Industry specially dispatched Bao Guohua to Shanghai again to discuss resolution methods with the municipal government. Bao arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon. It is said that Bao is carrying the principles set by the Ministry of Industry as the basis for negotiation. The principle is that although the right of judgment belongs to them, the right of handling still belongs to us as the minimum limit.</p>
<p>It was rumored that Director Yu expressed a negative message. The reporter specially visited Yu yesterday to inquire whether the report was true. He was informed that the national affairs were in an emergency situation and that he would never be negative. He had suffered hardships for a long time and would do his best. He came to Shanghai due to a foot ailment. The past few days have been very good, and he will return to the capital as soon as he recovers slightly.</p>

<p>Due to transportation issues, postal mail to and from various border provinces in our country is inconvenient, especially in provinces such as Gansu, Qinghai, and Xinjiang. Huang Naishu, the Director General of Posts, realized that the postal affairs in the Northeast have been seized, resulting in a deficit of 4 million yuan. Therefore, on the one hand, he is tightening expenditures, and on the other hand, he is developing postal services in the border provinces. Mail service has already been opened between Xingxing Gorge (Gansu) and Hami (Xinjiang) in this postal area starting on the 11th of this month. The postal bureau in this city received a special telegram from the postal director of the area yesterday, so it has notified the postal bureaus nationwide to receive and deliver mail to the area.

<p>Request for Central Government Assistance, Mayor Wu Seeks Aid for Expelled Overseas Chinese</p>
<p>Recently, an anti-Chinese movement has occurred in Mexico. More than 4,000 overseas Chinese who have been expelled from Mexico and returned to the country have arrived one after another. At 10 AM yesterday morning, Peng Canguang, Lin Wenli, Fang Difai, Huang Zhulin, and other four people were specially dispatched as representatives to the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Fenglin Bridge to petition. Zhang Mengling received them. The representatives first stated the reasons and circumstances of the anti-Chinese sentiment in Mexico and then requested the Foreign Office to submit a serious negotiation to the Mexican authorities. Zhang agreed to submit the above-mentioned circumstances to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for verification. The representatives expressed satisfaction and then went to the municipal government to petition. Secretary-General Yu personally came out to receive them. The representatives requested the municipal government to forward the request to the central government for relief. Secretary-General Yu accepted the request, and the representatives were satisfied and left.</p>
<p>Shanghai Mayor Wu Tiecheng sent a letter to various organizations yesterday, stating: "Respectfully, recently, after the anti-Chinese movement occurred in Mexico, overseas Chinese have been returning to the country in succession. It has been found that all the properties of the refugees were confiscated by the Mexican government. The journey was hasty, resulting in empty pockets. The situation is extremely tragic. In addition to the previous reports from the representatives of the refugees, Li Kuan, and others, who successively went to the government to describe the expulsion process and the situation of more than 200 refugees in Shanghai awaiting assistance, this government has asked local organizations in this city to provide relief. It is now reported that 59 additional refugees, including Lin Huiyao, are in urgent need of assistance. It is believed that these refugees have been doing business overseas and have been generous in donating money whenever there were domestic disaster relief and defense issues. They were enthusiastic and patriotic overseas Chinese in the past. Now, they are being expelled and are having difficulty returning home. The various organizations have the welfare of these people at heart and are charitable. Remembering the past, they should rise up to provide relief to the refugees passing through Shanghai so that they can return to their hometowns. The kindness will be admired by overseas Chinese everywhere. Special delivery."</p>
<h3 id="e128">Japanese Initiates the Establishment of Foreign Residents' Association <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>Using Foreign Backgrounds to Fulfill Their Ambitions, a Free City as Its Ultimate Goal</p>
<p>According to China United News Agency in this city, our agency received a telegram from Tokyo last night, stating that the Japanese in Shanghai have organized a Foreign Residents' Association to use the backgrounds of foreign residents in Shanghai to echo the Japanese army in North China and re-raise the issue of a free city in order to fulfill their ambitions over the years. After receiving the news, our agency sent personnel to investigate the truth. According to a certain Japanese person, the mastermind of this organization is Tatsuo Funatsu. In order to save the situation in Hongkou, it is planned to designate Zhabei, Jiangwan, and Wusong as a transformed Japanese concession (free city) and recruit foreign residents from Britain, the United States, France, Germany, Italy, and the Netherlands to organize a Foreign Residents' Association. This group is to be the backing for the so-called free city plan. Yesterday, the organization's declaration, which consisted of 15 articles, was released. The main points are excerpted as follows: (1) The purpose is to maintain unity and cooperation among foreigners in Shanghai and promote the peace, security, and prosperity of this metropolis. Since last year, several foreigners have often met to discuss various issues that are closely related to the interests of the foreign community. (2) The opinions of the comrades have reached a consensus that there is no other way to effectively express the opinions of the foreign residents' organizations, chambers of commerce, and foreign residents in Shanghai except to organize this association. (3) According to the existing laws of the Public Concession, only 30% of the foreign residents have the right to vote. The remaining 70% have no opportunity to express their opinions on issues that are closely related to their interests. (4) The primary purpose of this association is to protect the interests of foreign residents in various countries. Any foreign resident residing in Shanghai who is over 18 years old can become a member of this association by paying an annual membership fee of only one yuan. (5) We often hear foreign residents say that there are issues that are deeply related to our interests but have no opportunity for consultation because there was no proper organization in the past. (6) The most important research topics of this association should be the interests of foreign residents in all parts of China and Shanghai, especially the administrative facilities of Shanghai and the promotion of peace, security, and prosperity. (7) The advantage of this association is that it can maintain close contact with existing organizations in various countries. When a certain organization in a certain country wants to request its government to take necessary actions for the benefit of its foreign residents, this association will be the backing to connect various organizations to assist in the implementation of its ambitions. (8) In order to ensure that the interests of Shanghai citizens are consistent, this association wants to work closely with the Chinese Taxpayers Association and other industrial and commercial organizations. (9) This association can submit opinions on issues related to the interests of foreign residents in Shanghai to the diplomatic corps, consular corps, and the League of Nations. Although no certain issues have occurred at present, they will always occur in the future. (10) Regardless of whether it is a local issue or an issue of general interest to foreign residents, it should not be considered from the sole position of one country. We should assess and study countermeasures from the perspective of the overall interests of foreign residents in Shanghai. Only by maintaining this principle can we maintain the common interests of foreign residents. (11) The temporary committee of this association will be initially nominated by organizations and chambers of commerce in various countries. (12) The current temporary committee will continue to perform its duties during this year. After the articles of association are drafted at the end of this year, the members will be asked for their consent. (13) The strength of this association depends entirely on the members and foreign residents in Shanghai. (14) The committee members of this association deeply believe that strength should come from unity. Therefore, we sincerely hope that foreign residents will provide strong assistance. (15) We hope that everyone who receives this letter will fill in their names on the membership certificate and send it along with the membership fee of one yuan to help the activities of this association. All donations are welcome. It is heard that the Japanese Civic Group will force all Japanese residents to join in order to manipulate the actual power. Another Japanese organization has been added to Shanghai.</p>

<h3 id="e130">International Labour Conference to Discuss Reduction of Working Hours <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>Preparatory Meeting Has Produced Draft Agreement Aims to Achieve a Forty-Hour Work Week</p>
<p>The Central News Agency reports that the International Labour Office broadcast the key agenda items of the upcoming 17th Labour Conference from 8:00 PM to 12:00 AM the day before yesterday via the Geneva radio station. Our local Transportation Ministry's International Radio Station monitored the broadcast, and our agency has translated the key points as follows:</p>
<p>The 17th International Labour Conference, hosted by the International Labour Office, is scheduled to open in Geneva on June 8th. The fifth item on its agenda is to consider the report on the reduction of working hours submitted by the preparatory meeting. The preparatory meeting was held in Geneva in January of this year, with representatives from 35 countries participating. The U.S. Consul in Geneva also attended as an observer, acting on instructions from Washington. The meeting conducted preliminary research on the reduction of working hours as a means to alleviate worldwide unemployment, with particular attention to the forty-hour work week plan. After the meeting, a report was drafted and sent to various governments on February 14th, requesting that they submit their opinions before April 15th. The Labour Office then compiled these opinions and drafted a grey-blue report for discussion at the conference. The report includes a draft agreement on the reduction of working hours, stipulating that the working hours of industrial, factory, mining, commercial, and other factory workers should be reduced by up to three hours per week compared to the maximum working hours stipulated in previous agreements, thus covering a wide range. Almost all workers are included except for agricultural and water transport workers. However, due to the different circumstances of various workers, it seems necessary to draft three types of agreement for selection. In general, the conference will first pass two types of agreement, with the third type only for discussion and the decision on whether to adopt it will be made at the next meeting. The draft regarding factory workers is largely based on the Washington Agreement, with an average of forty hours per week. The definition of "working hours" in the draft remains the same as in the 1930 agreement, namely the time during which employed workers are subject to the employer's direction. Detailed provisions are also included for the calculation of average working hours, with particular attention to methods of reducing working hours, employing new workers, and facilitating management. For work with special circumstances, special regulations are made for working hours and shift arrangements. However, in the event of unexpected or emergency situations, the limits on working hours may be temporarily lifted. The principle for limiting coal mine working hours is 40 hours per week, with the general provisions being the same as the 1931 agreement, namely a maximum of seven hours and forty-five minutes for daily underground work, and an average of thirty-eight hours and forty-five minutes per week, excluding Sundays and holidays. Several clauses of the three draft agreements are completely identical, such as the special provisions in the event of special emergencies. In summary, although the purpose of these agreements is to alleviate unemployment, they are independent of previous agreements and do not modify them. These agreements are temporary rather than permanent in nature. The draft also stipulates that the agreement will come into effect three months after ratification, but the duration of the agreement has not been specified, pending a decision by the conference.</p>

<p>Hopes That Our Country Will Unite in Sincerity to Effectively Resist the Manchurian Problem</p>
<p>The New News Agency reports that Haig Road Jiaotong University invited William Martin, editor of the Geneva newspaper, to give a lecture on China and the League of Nations in the Wen Zhi Hall at 11:00 AM yesterday. Approximately 400 faculty, staff, and students of the university attended. The President of the university, Li Zhaohuan, delivered a welcoming speech in English, followed by William Martin's lecture, the main points of which are as follows: The causes of the Sino-Japanese incident can be traced back decades, namely the Sino-Japanese War and the Russo-Japanese War. The so-called Manchurian problem had already attracted the attention of the Japanese government and public. At that time, the League of Nations had not yet been established, so the League of Nations after the September 18th Incident was not fully aware of the situation and could not offer much help. In addition, various countries were preoccupied with their own economic problems and had no time to worry about others. The key is that your country (referring to China) must unite in sincerity to effectively resist. If the League of Nations provides as much assistance as possible in a friendly manner, and if my own impressions from my observations in your country can be disseminated as much as possible, that will be helpful. The President then delivered a speech of thanks in English. The meeting adjourned at 12:30 PM.</p>

<p>The National Goods Movement Committee of the First Special District Citizens' Federation, after a resolution passed at the Fourth Congress of Representatives, will hold the Second National Goods Movement Propaganda Meeting at the Ningbo Fellow-Villagers Association at 1:00 PM tomorrow afternoon. Preparations have been completed. The notices are as follows: (1) Solicitation of Gifts: Greetings.

<p>The Commodity Inspection Bureau yesterday wrote to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce to explain its commodity inspection authority. The original letter stated: Greetings. We received your letter Shang Zi No. 306, which stated that the Intestine Industry Association had reported that members of the China Intestine Factory had complained that recently, meat inspectors from the Municipal Health Bureau had stopped shipments of pig intestines, forcing them to pay inspection fees according to the regulations for inspecting cured hams, but pig intestines have always been inspected by the Commodity Inspection Bureau. Therefore, they requested that you forward their request to the Municipal Health Bureau to instruct the meat inspectors to exempt pig intestines from inspection and fees. We are therefore writing to your bureau to request that you forward our request to the Health Bureau to stop duplicate inspections of pig intestines in order to comply with statutory authority and avoid extra burdens on intestine merchants. In response, Article 1 of the Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau's regulations for inspecting meat entering the city stipulates that the bureau shall notify our bureau to send personnel to inspect meat products sold abroad. Therefore, sausage casings manufactured in Shanghai and shipped abroad after inspection by our bureau are no longer inspected by the Health Bureau. However, whether pig intestines should be inspected when entering the city is within the authority of the Health Bureau. Please write directly to the Health Bureau to discuss this matter. We are writing to inform you for your information.</p>

<p>The Party and Government Authorities Summoned Contractors for Questioning Yesterday and Scheduled to Summon Labor Representatives for Questioning Today</p>
<p>The Municipal Dockworkers' Union, in order to implement the two-eight system, previously sent representatives to the Municipal Government and the Municipal Party Headquarters to petition, and then submitted a document to the Party and Government Authorities requesting its early implementation to maintain the livelihoods of the workers. It is now known that the Municipal Government and the Municipal Party Headquarters have received instructions from the Central Government to implement the dockworkers' labor-contractor two-eight system. Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, the Municipal Government, together with representatives from the Municipal Party Headquarters, convened a meeting with representatives from the contractor side in the Municipal Government Conference Room in Fenglinqiao and scheduled to continue convening a meeting with representatives from the labor side this afternoon to discuss a solution.</p>

<p>Further Preparations for Shanghai-Guangdong, Sichuan-Guizhou Routes</p>
<p>According to the National News Agency, China National Aviation Corporation has completed the entire Shanghai-Chengdu line and is adding Shanghai-Guangdong and Sichuan-Guizhou routes, as well as related news about the Haizhou, Nantong, and Qingdao airports. Secretary Li of the company gave reporters a detailed account yesterday, which is recorded below:</p>
<h3 id="e137">Confirmed Date for Trial Flight on Chongqing-Chengdu Route <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>After the company sent personnel to negotiate with the authorities in Sichuan on flying the Chongqing-Chengdu section, active preparations began. It was originally scheduled for a trial flight yesterday. Now, because the aircraft to be used for the trial flight has been decided to be the No. 12 Stinson land plane, it needs to be refitted with a specially made thick glass fuselage. Other radio materials also need to be purchased for installation on the plane in Chengdu. Therefore, the date has been delayed. It is now decided that the trial flight will take place on June 1st. If the results are good, the official opening will take place the next day without further delay.</p>
<h3 id="e138">Additional Shanghai-Guangdong and Sichuan-Guizhou Routes <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>Preparing the Shanghai-Guangdong route was originally a planned project of the company. However, the report from Hong Kong stating that the opening was scheduled for July 1st is not accurate. The company is currently actively completing the Chongqing-Chengdu section of the Shanghai-Chengdu line. Once that section is officially opened, the Shanghai-Guangdong air route will be implemented. The route will go from Shanghai via Wenzhou, Xiamen, etc., to Guangzhou or extend to Hong Kong. This section can use seaplanes and is easier to prepare. It can be realized around mid-August. The Sichuan-Guizhou route is from Chengdu to Guiyang, and the route passes through high mountains and ridges, making flying more difficult. It will generally be organized after the Shanghai-Guangdong route is completed.</p>
<h3 id="e139">Haizhou, Nantong, and Qingdao Airports <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>The Haizhou Airport on the company's Shanghai-Ping lines has completed the construction of station houses and gas stations. In Nantong, in order to prevent bad weather, it is planned to set up a reserve airport using civilian land, which has been approved by the Ministry of Transportation. Technical Assistant Yu Shipu has been sent to Tong to work with the county government. The electric poles and jetties around the Qingdao Airport that previously obstructed flight have been requested to be moved by the Qingdao Municipal Government and the Telephone Bureau, and they have agreed to implement this.</p>

<p>The Chinese Children's Welfare Association hosted leaders from all sectors of Shanghai at the Cathay Hotel at noon on May 15th. The host was Fei Meide, an executive member of the association who has been practicing medicine in Shanghai for over 40 years. The venue was elegantly decorated with child welfare charts hanging on all sides. Attendees included Kong Xiangxi, Wu Tiecheng, Zhu Ziqiao, Wang Zhengting, Zhao Jinqing, Li Ting'an, Xu Jianping, Mr. and Mrs. Guo Shun, Yan Sixiang, Mr. and Mrs. Ke Yinhang, Mrs. Li Jinlun, Fei Wusheng, Le Linsheng, Pei Si, and others, totaling dozens of people. First, the host</p>

<p>Delivered a speech, briefly stating that the Children's Welfare Association has had considerable success in the past. Soon, a model educational institution will be built in Nanjing. The construction costs have already been donated by Chairman Kong from the United States, and the land was allocated by the National Government years ago. Shanghai should also have a similar expansion, with at least one model children's welfare institution established. He has already discussed this matter with Mayor Wu, and the mayor believes that a good location can be allocated. The funding will certainly not be a problem because the association has Chairman Kong as its leader, as well as the support of Mr. Zhu Ziqiao, Mr. Wang Zhengting, Mr. Zhao Jinqing, and Mr. Guo Shun. It will certainly be easy to raise funds in the future. To this end, the association has scheduled a tea dance at the Yiyuan on May 25th, selling 2,000 tickets, which should yield approximately 10,000 yuan. Many valuable prizes have also been prepared, such as calligraphy and paintings by famous people, round-trip tickets to Hong Kong and Dalian, electric fans, electric clocks, and various gifts from major stores, which will be drawn by lottery with the tickets. This is not only a good opportunity to raise money but also to promote child welfare. Then the Chairman of the Association</p>

<p>Delivered a speech, briefly stating that the history, purpose, work, and plans of the association are already known to everyone. However, child welfare is the entire business of China, and one association cannot undertake everything. Therefore, the association attaches great importance to promotion, publicity, and communication, hoping that everyone will participate. Thus, the fundraising from holding this child welfare tea dance is a minor matter, and the real significance is to use this to promote the cause of child welfare. The Mayor then</p>

<p>Delivered a speech, briefly stating that China's population is 400 million, which is large in quantity but not high in quality. In the future, we must make all 400 million people excellent, starting from childhood. The Chinese Children's Welfare Association has already started working on this and has achieved results. Can we not follow up and complete this qualitative aspect of the entire nation? Then Dr. Wang Zhengting delivered a speech, briefly stating that everyone agrees with the cause of child welfare. The ancient saying goes, "Love the children of others as you love your own." Everyone is a child who has grown into an adult, and everyone has children. Therefore, everyone should do their best and work together to carry out the cause of child welfare and to be the backbone of the cause of child welfare. Then</p>

<p>General delivered a speech, briefly stating that the cause of the Chinese Children's Welfare Association already has a considerable foundation. We should build on this foundation and work hard to promote this cause to enrich the future life of the nation. This is not only enough to save us from danger but also to accumulate virtue and merit. Then, the U.S. Consul General Ke Yinhang was invited to give a speech, briefly stating that the cause of child welfare is the central cause in the process of world life. Anything related to world affairs cannot be separated from the cause of child welfare. I am deeply impressed by the fact that the Children's Welfare Association, which was established not long ago, has been able to achieve such results. I hope that everyone present will work even harder in the future so that the cause of child welfare can be popularized throughout the country and achieve the highest level of success. I will do my best to follow behind you. Finally, the manager of the British American Tobacco Company</p>

<p>Delivered a speech, briefly stating that promoting and making people aware of something is essential. The cause of the Chinese Children's Welfare Association must first be made known to many people so that everyone can sympathize and want to help. Therefore, today's meeting is to make people aware of the importance of the cause of child welfare. I firmly believe that those who know will be able to sympathize and provide practical assistance. Then the General Secretary of the Association</p>

<p>Reported the meaning and methods of holding the tea dance, and especially mentioned that the tea dance's program is excellent and the prizes are numerous, which have never been seen before. In addition to elegant music and delicious food, there will also be masterpieces from Dr. Mei Lanfang, Mrs. Du Yuesheng, and others. The guests and hosts were happy at 2:00 PM and took pictures to commemorate the event.</p>
<h3 id="e148">Ancient Tree Struck by Lightning <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday (May 15th), the weather was hot. Around 3:00 PM in the afternoon, dark clouds gathered and lightning flashed. A heavy rain poured down, and thunder rumbled. An ancient tree, over ten feet tall, in the Qitaitou area of Meizhou Road, Yangshupu, Shanghai East, was suddenly struck in two pieces during the thunderstorm. It was not until after 4:00 PM, when the rain stopped and the sky cleared, that the nearby residents discovered it. For a time, people gathered from far and wide to watch, almost like a human mountain. Someone suggested that there must be something strange about the tree being struck, and claimed that the wood from the struck tree could cure diseases. As a result, in an instant, the remaining wood of the tree was seized and emptied by the onlookers.</p>
<h3 id="e149">Aviation Film Script <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>The First Meeting Was Held Yesterday to Review the Script, Which Still Needs to Be Revised Before It Can Be Filmed</p>
<p>The participants in the film save-the-nation movement of the China Aviation Association include the Star, Lianhua, Tianyi, Jinan, Hensheng, Yueming, and Datong film companies. They plan to jointly film a movie, with the full film price donated to the Aviation Association to purchase a movie projector. The content of the film script is to depict the aviation enthusiasm of workers, peasants, merchants, students, and other sectors. Each company is responsible for filming a section, and each company also writes its own script according to the scope set. Pan Gongzhan, Hong Shen, Yao Sufeng, Zhang Tingrong, and Shen Gao were selected as script review committee members. The association held its first general meeting at the Municipal Education Bureau at 4:00 PM yesterday, reviewing the scripts of each company one by one. The members of the committee felt that the scripts of the companies lacked uniformity. It was decided that Hong Shen and Yao Sufeng should be commissioned to revise the scripts, which would then be submitted to the second general meeting next Wednesday for approval before filming begins.</p>
<h3 id="e150">Northern Sea Dried Fish Arrives Yesterday <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>Limited Goods, Many Customers, Sold Exclusively in Wusong</p>
<p>The Shandong Tao Luo sand boat Wang Changxing, loaded with northern sea dried fish, arrived in Song yesterday and was sold through the Cuisheng Fish Shop. Because of its immediate arrival, the shop opened the market immediately, selling it at twenty yuan per dan downstream. The holds were then opened and sold out in an instant. Because only 1,000 fish were obtained, not only were the Jiashan, Hangzhou, and other customer groups not assigned, but even the Shanghai group was not assigned. The 1,000 dried fish distributed to the Wusong salted fish shops were still not enough. According to the boatmen, the fish population was not strong this year and many ships in the ocean did not get any fish. However, the dried fish is extremely delicious. Its best-selling places are Suzhou, Jiaxing, Hangzhou, Linping, and other places, so purchasing agents from those places are waiting in Song.</p>
<h3 id="e151">Extortion Letters Belong to the Party Involved In Publishing An Advertisement To Express Sincerity <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>Those belonging to the category used money to put the telegram in the pole letterbox to inquire on behalf of the party concerned as agreed</p>
<p>The Extortionist And His Second Landlord Were Arrested</p>
<p>Zhu Panquan, a native of Suzhou, lives at No. 2, Lane 201, Tongfu Road. Last year, during the January 28th incident in Shanghai, he suddenly received a threatening letter from someone claiming to be Huang Hua, with rather激烈 words, hoping to extort 5,000 yuan. If he agreed to pay, Zhu was instructed to publish a reply in the newspaper. After receiving the letter, Zhu reported the information to the Jing'an Temple Police Station because he was running a light business and had economic difficulties. On the one hand, he published a reply in the newspaper. On February 13th of last year, he received another letter asking to contact him near the Great World on February 12th. Because the date had passed, it was not implemented. Unexpectedly, on May 2nd and 8th of this year, he received two letters in succession, and the amount of the request was changed to 1,000 yuan. If he agreed, he still had to publish an advertisement on the cover of the Xinwen Bao to express his sincerity. Zhu then acted according to the letter. On the 11th, he received a reply from Huang Hua, asking him to prepare the money and send it to the paper letterbox on the telegraph pole at the entrance of Songqing Lane, No. 80, Daokou Chong Alley, Zhuanwan, Jingtu Street, Xicang Street in the city at 11:00 PM on the 12th. A paper with the name Huang Hua seeking people was posted on the telegraph pole. If the money was placed properly, the paper bearing the name Huang Hua could be torn in half as a sign. Zhu immediately reported to the police station and ordered Detective Fan Defu, Detective Jin Yangwu, and other detectives from the Public Security Bureau to disguise themselves and go to the place to ambush. On one side, a representative, Zhu Yongquan, was sent to take the prepared newspaper in the style of banknotes and put it into the paper letterbox. Soon, Qian Hongsheng, a local man living at No. 10, Yixing Lane, Daokou Chong Alley, came slowly and put his hand into the paper letterbox to take out the paper package when he was arrested by the detectives. A rifle and 50 bullets were seized at his home, and Qian confessed without denying it. However, the detectives also seized the items used to write the letter, which were provided by the second landlord, Xu Haokun, and brought them into the Public Security Bureau on the 13th, returning to the police station. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Criminal Court of the First Special District Local Court for interrogation by Judge Wu Tingqi. The police station's lawyer, Li Zhishan, accused them of violating Article 2 of the Punishment of Bandits Ordinance and Article 370 of the Criminal Law, and said that the handwriting of the defendant still needs to be identified, so the five threatening letters cannot be presented as evidence and requested a postponement. Then Detective Fan reported the situation of the arrest. The plaintiff, Zhu Panquan, went to Su for important matters and entrusted his relative Wu Chengliang to represent him in court to explain the facts of the case. Zhu Yongquan also testified to prove everything. When asked, the defendant confessed that it was because of the impact of the January 28th incident, his family was destroyed, and because he was unemployed and had no foothold, he took this course of action. This matter was done by him alone and there were no accomplices. When Xu Haokun was questioned, he denied the charges. Judge Wu instructed that the case be rescheduled for further interrogation.</p>

The Commander-in-Chief led them out of the stadium and paraded through the streets. After the work of each group was completed, they were still lined up end-to-end and returned to the county from the Christian Church and dispersed. When working, party and government personnel all held brooms and swept the street garbage to both sides for accumulation. The streets were cleaned by the cleaners, so the streets were brand new. The masses participated in watching, and the road was blocked for a while.</p>

<p>The competition was most intense in the Machine Gun Cup. It is known that last Sunday (the 14th) was the day dedicated to the machine gun competition. On that day, players from various countries gathered at the shooting range to compete for victory. A total of twenty-two teams participated, each with four players. The course was an offensive type. The players were pre-positioned at the 500-yard mark. Upon seeing the target rise, they immediately carried their guns and sprinted forward to the 400-yard mark, where they fired forty shots in rapid succession. Then, they advanced to the 300-yard mark and fired another forty shots. The time limit from start to finish was two minutes. The Chinese team's second squad won, scoring 138 points, ranking first among the machine gun teams from various countries. As usual, they won the National Machine Gun Cup (the cup was a gift from the former Chairman of the Municipal Council, Mr. Rawlings, and is quite tall). The players were Ye Renqian, Ni Ruilong, Zhang Songyuan, and Wu Huaqi. Second place went to the Shanghai Light Artillery Team, with 117 points. Third place also went to the Chinese team, the sixteenth squad, with 105 points. The Chinese team has always been renowned for machine gun shooting, and this victory marks their third time winning, truly deserving of praise.</p>

<h3 id="e163">A Visit to the Caohejing Prison <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>Lawyer Dong Kang submitted a petition to the Ministry of Justice on behalf of the prisoners on the 12th of this month, requesting a thorough investigation of the Jiangsu Second Model Prison in Caohejing for deducting food rations and mistreating prisoners. The Ministry of Justice has not yet made a formal response to the case. The content is of concern to advocates of humanity. A reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency drove to Caohejing yesterday to investigate the situation. The details are not exhaustive in a glimpse. The following is a record of the visit:</p>
<p>The Warden's Attitude: When the reporter arrived at the Second Prison, he immediately met with Warden Tian Jinghua. According to him, he believed that there was no need to defend himself against lawyer Dong Kang's petition, and he welcomed all sectors and the press to investigate and visit at any time to prove the truth. Moreover, the Director and Section Chief of the Prison Department of the Ministry of Justice and the Section Chief of the High Court regularly inspected the prison, so the competent authorities also attached great importance to the lives of criminals in the prison.</p>
<p>Number of Inmates: He continued that there were more than 1,700 inmates in the prison, with criminal offenders accounting for more than 1,600, political prisoners accounting for more than 120, and two Western offenders. There were more than 1,500 male inmates and more than 180 female inmates. Among the female inmates, most were opium offenders.</p>
<p>Distribution of All Prison Cells: These more than 1,700 criminals, apart from the female prisoners who are housed in more than 40 separate cells, the rest are housed in 264 cells, divided into seven types: A, B, C, D, E, F, and G. The 60 G-type cells originally housed one person each, but due to overcrowding, they have been changed to house three people each. The remaining six types house a maximum of 14 people, with an average of 11 or 12 people.</p>
<p>Expenditure of 8,000 Yuan: The prison's monthly expenditure is allocated by the Military and Political Department and the Finance Department of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, totaling 8,000 yuan, including expenses for prisoner rations, clothing, medicine, and construction. Criminal prisoners' rations are one dime, and political prisoners' rations are one dime and five cents, with the remainder used for clothing, medicine, hygiene, and other expenses. However, there is always a slight surplus each month for expansion and subsidies. Up to now, the surplus totals 2,400 yuan, which is deposited in the prison for emergencies and the accounts are submitted to the Supreme Court for review.</p>
<p>Ration Supply is Ample: The actual need for one dime's worth of rations for criminal offenders and one dime and five cents' worth of rations for political prisoners is between 8.5 or 9 cents, with an average surplus of 1.5 cents. However, political prisoners receive better treatment than criminal offenders. For example, the price of tea provided is higher than that for criminal offenders. If we only talk about rations, the two sides actually come from the same pot and there is not much difference. The rice eaten by the prisoners is small-milled rice, and the side dishes are vegetables, taro, and beans.</p>
<p>Attention to Prisoner Hygiene: There were originally only two doctors in terms of hygiene. Since I took office in December last year, I have added a third. They are indeed extremely busy treating prisoners every day. Haircuts and shaves are held once a week. There is a bathhouse that can accommodate 20 people each time. Due to limited funds, the pool is small and there are many people, so they have to take turns every day. I have now submitted a request to the Ministry of Justice to expand the original bathhouse, hoping that it can accommodate 100 people each time, so that the nearly 2,000 prisoners can all bathe a dozen times a day.</p>
<p>Denial of Confiscation of Sent Items: As for the confiscation of prisoner items and work products, there is evidence to check and I can absolutely take responsibility. When family members send items, in addition to the prison issuing a formal receipt, the prisoners themselves also add their fingerprints. It is definitely not possible to confiscate them arbitrarily. In the future, it may be possible to ask the prisoners' families to review them.</p>
<p>Ordinary Prisoners Can Communicate: Stopping communication and withholding mail is based on the law. It is because political prisoners may have other destructive and propaganda actions, so this restriction only applies to political prisoners, not ordinary criminal prisoners. As for saying that lawyer Dong Kang's two prisoners, only Lu Zongduan is indeed in prison. There is no such person as Wang Jiaxiang. Lu Zongduan is one of the political prisoners. He was recently sent to Xin Puyu Hall for medical treatment due to illness. His accusation may have arisen at this time.</p>
<p>Lu Zongduan's Own Account: Afterwards, the warden brought Lu Zongduan to meet with the reporter. According to Lu's own account, he completely denied lawyer Dong Kang's petition to the Ministry of Justice and said that he was 31 years old, a native of Hubei. He was originally an editor at the Hubei Minbao newspaper. He was arrested in Shanghai in February of the 20th year of the Republic of China for a Communist Party case and sentenced to ten years in prison. He was given a three-year reduction in sentence during the amnesty. The treatment in prison is still good and he can eat his fill every meal. However, he denied going to Xin Puyu Hall for medical treatment. At that time, Lu was wearing a blue-gray short shirt and trousers with a black padded jacket. He was healthy and not in a state of despair.</p>
<p>Complete Inspection Once: After the warden's oral account, he guided the reporter to visit all the prisons at the reporter's request. The interior cleaning was still clean, but the air was not very circulating and the stench was unbearable. Although the rice cooked in the kitchen was rough, it was still edible. However, the side dishes cooked seemed not very well done and were half-cooked. The prison has various small handicrafts such as spinning, weaving, knitting, printing, typesetting, toothbrush making, and pasting paper boxes. The funds total 3,000 yuan. More than 1,100 people are working, and those who are not working are either political prisoners who want to engage in propaganda or are sick. The profit distribution is about one-quarter to one-fifth per prisoner, and each prisoner can get about 1.5 to 2 dimes a day. Inside the prison, apart from working hours, they get up at 6 am every morning, start working at 7:30 am, and go to sleep at 9 pm.</p>

<p>A Meeting Was Held by Participating Factories Yesterday</p>
<p>The Shanghai Citizens' National Products Promotion Association and the China National Products Maintenance Association, as the Yinxian National Products Exhibition Preparatory Committee, decided to postpone the opening to the 15th of next month because the free transportation reduction forms have not yet been issued and the construction of the venue has not been completed in time. It is reported that the entire plan, in particular, convened the Third Factory Representatives' Conference at the Association Hall in Jiumudi at 3 pm yesterday. Representatives from Xianshi Cosmetics Factory, Limin Dyeing and Weaving Factory, Zhenhua Manufacturing Factory, Yabu Er Electric Appliance Factory, etc., totaling 118 people, were publicly elected Chen Yiting as the chairman, and the ceremony was performed as usual. First, the chairman reported on the purpose of the meeting, stating that the association, in order to expand the national products movement and awaken the people in the interior, gather the power of national products to save the country, led the factories to participate in the Yinxian National Products Exhibition and sent personnel to Ningbo to repeatedly negotiate with the local presiding authorities and reach a compromise. The opening was scheduled for the 20th of this month, and all factories participated enthusiastically and actively prepared all the procedures that have been completed. Now that the General Assembly has resolved to postpone the opening to June 15, the future of the association is extremely important. The association serves the factories and all the progress is based on the will of the members. The preparatory committee considers this matter to be of great importance and should be discussed by the factory representatives. It is hoped that the representatives will provide long-term suggestions to jointly plan the progress. Then, Zhu Haichao and Yang Wangcheng, representatives to Ningbo, and Chen Peng, representatives to Dinghai, successively reported on the facts of the negotiation. Next, more than ten people from Tiansheng Ziwei Vegetarian Factory and Sanlian Weaving Factory expressed their opinions, saying that the preparations for each factory took a lot of time and energy, and that the postponement was too long and caused many difficulties. Moreover, it conflicted with the exhibition period of other national products exhibitions in the first half of the year, and the General Assembly should pay attention to the facts and shorten the postponement so as not to live up to the sincere enthusiasm of the participating factories. In the end, the chairman summarized the opinions of the group and resolved as follows: (1) Send a letter to the General Assembly requesting the opening to be advanced to June 1; (2) Publicly elect Zhu representative Haichao to go to Ningbo again to firmly request; (3) The Dinghai National Products Exhibition will be held in connection after the closing of the Ningbo Exhibition, with a term of only one week to preserve the original plan of other national products exhibitions; (4) Committee member Zheng Liankun will still be responsible for the construction of the venue; (5) Prepare oil tarpaulins and generators and allocate funds from the association's fund to the executive committee for quick handling.</p>

How to determine the method will be determined after the reply. Fortunately, the public should not be impatient. Ling Lingfu proposed that in order to protect the survival of our industry, a temporary joint association must be organized. Shen Youlai seconded and the whole body agreed.

<p>The report of the Commissioner of Public Health for April states that the death rate for foreigners this month was 13.10 per thousand, compared to 15.45 last month. The main reason for the decrease was the reduction in deaths from pneumonia. The death rate for Chinese this month was 10.30, compared to 130.6 last month. This report is not complete, but it is enough to show that the public health has improved. In terms of birth statistics, 39 births were reported for foreigners and 123 births were recorded for Chinese. Regarding the method of statistics, the Department of Statistics of the Lister Institute of Medical Research and experts from the London School of Hygiene in Shanghai have been asked to review it in order to improve it.</p>
<p>The infectious diseases prevalent among foreigners are scarlet fever, diphtheria, and tuberculosis, but scarlet fever has shown a decreasing trend. This is also due to seasonal factors. Among the Chinese, smallpox, tuberculosis, and cerebrospinal meningitis are more common. Cerebrospinal meningitis is also trending downwards. The discovery of mad dogs has increased recently. The public should pay more attention to the supervision of the dogs they keep. The number of vaccinations against smallpox this month was 8,111 handled by the motor vehicle team and 23,691 handled by the various health divisions, totaling 86,748 people vaccinated from the beginning of January to the end of April.</p>
<p>The production of milk this month decreased by 3.5% compared to March. The chemical analysis and microbial tests of milk were generally satisfactory. All A-grade milk met the standards. The work in the slaughterhouses was roughly the same as usual. The price of vegetables in the small vegetable markets did not fluctuate much. The inspections of bakeries day and night were generally satisfactory. The spring cleaning of food stores was carried out according to regulations and the situation was quite improved.</p>
<p>Mosquito eradication work started earlier this year. The first step is to clear the rivers and ditches, and do everything possible to eliminate all places where mosquitoes breed. The water accumulation in the open space opposite the Licha Restaurant has also been started to be removed.</p>

The hospital cures tens of millions of epidemic cases every year. The outpatient department is also very crowded, treating internal and external medicine, and the number of people seeking medical treatment reaches more than 400 every day. Over the years, the treatment results have been well-received and it is truly a valuable charitable organization in Shanghai. The hospital's expenses rely entirely on the continuous input of enthusiastic people from all walks of life and the efforts of the hospital directors to raise funds. Now that it is the summer season, it will cost even more to accommodate epidemic patients. It is heard that the funds for this year are about to be raised.</p>

<p>丨Drowned While Entering Xiaohama to Retrieve a Ball丨</p>
<p>Shi Yongqing, a 40-year-old man from Haimen who lived at No. 4, Huanglu Road, Jiangwan Road, is currently working as a shop clerk at the Jinye Exchange on Jiujiang Road with a monthly salary of 21 yuan. However, in addition to his wife, he also has four sons and four daughters, so his life is difficult. Therefore, Shi went to the Japanese Corefu Ball Field in Hongkou Target Field every morning at 9 am to retrieve balls, earning a daily wage of 2 dimes, which he used to supplement his household expenses. Yesterday morning at nearly 9 am, Shi went to the field to retrieve balls as usual. Suddenly, a ball rolled into the opposite Hama. A certain Japanese player ordered Shi Yongqing to enter the water to retrieve the ball. The Hama was about two or three zhang deep. After Shi entered the water, he drowned tragically. Then, someone salvaged the body and sent it to the Tongren Hospital for transfer to the coroner's office for examination.</p>

<h3 id="e185">Foreign Silk Store Suspected of Arson for Insurance Money <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>A Lot of Inflammable Materials Were Found in the Store, and the Austrian Manager and Others Were Detained</p>
<p>The Naowu Erde (transliteration) foreign silk store at No. 782 Jing'an Temple Road was founded by a British woman and hired a Russian named Boros as manager. On the 29th of last month, the manager and the British female store owner went to Yantai together for business. His managerial seat was temporarily replaced by Austrian Ou Sishi Tuolan Na sent by the Huizhong Bank. It happened that at more than 12:00 noon on the 3rd of this month, the store suddenly suffered a fire. At that time, thick smoke filled the air and the fire was blazing. After the firefighters drove to the scene to suck water and extinguish the fire, they also joined the West Patrolmen of the Jing'an Temple Patrol House to conduct a detailed investigation and learned that the store had insured a fire insurance of 52,000 taels of silver and found a lot of flammable materials in the store. It was suspected of arson for insurance money. Therefore, on Saturday last week, the acting manager Austrian Lanna and the store employees Russian Ivan Niko Huoxixuke Inwei Waste Stofski Huoxixuke (same name) and other five people were arrested and taken into the patrol house for detention. This morning, they were escorted to the Criminal Court No. 8 of the First Special District Court. The lawyer of the patrol house, Li Zhishan, stated that the defendants were arrested because they were suspected of arson, but the situation of the case was quite complicated and he requested that the defendants be allowed to be detained and specially interrogated on a later date. When he was asked, the defendant Lanna, an Austrian national aged 41, replied that because the store owner and manager went to Yantai together, he was temporarily replaced by the Huizhong Bank on May 3. The other four defendants (all store employees) left the store for lunch at 12:02 noon and locked the store door. When they returned to the store at about 2 pm, they saw that it was on fire and the firefighters put it out. He did not know how the fire started and he was an Austrian and the patrol house should not arrest him and send him to the Chinese court for trial, etc. He also hired a foreign lawyer to appear in court and apply for bail. In the end, lawyer Li stated that the Austrian consulate had allowed Lanna's detention and Austria had no extraterritoriality, so the court had the right to hear the case and he opposed the bail application because the patrol house was currently investigating the case. Judge Wu Zhuan ordered the case to be specially interrogated on a later date and the defendants were returned to custody.</p>
<h3 id="e186">Ministry of Railways Appoints Huang Zifang as Medical Advisor <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>Also Serves as Head of Health Section for Two Railway Bureaus</p>
<p>The health administration organization of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways originally had a medical director position established outside the Health Section of the General Affairs Department of the Management Bureau. The position of section chief was stipulated to be concurrently held by the medical director. The Health Section only had one administrative section, thus the responsibilities of medical technology and health administration were not clearly distinguished. Recently, the bureau changed its organizational structure, starting with the General Affairs Department, and enhanced the Health Section's organization. This was approved by the Ministry of Railways, changing the administrative section to a clerical section, and adding medical affairs and health care sections. The Ministry of Railways believes that the two railway lines have tens of thousands of employees, and their health is greatly related to work efficiency. Furthermore, the two railway lines have heavy passenger traffic, and the routes pass through many important cities, with the attention of both Chinese and foreigners. Therefore, the public health of all vehicles and stations is of utmost importance. Therefore, a few days ago, the ministry explicitly abolished the position of medical director of the railway lines, and the medical affairs were merged into the Health Section of the General Affairs Department. Dr. Huang Zifang, a medical advisor from the ministry, was appointed as section chief to actively reorganize the section. Huang studied in the United States, received scholarships from the Rockefeller Foundation several times, and served as a Class A medical officer in the Health Section of the League of Nations in Geneva. He has a high reputation in international medicine. Domestically, he has served as the director of the health bureaus of Hankou, Beiping, and other cities, and has rich experience in health administration. After being appointed, Huang has already visited the bureau once and met with Director Huang, Deputy Director Wu, and others. Deng Zhende, the original medical director and head of the Health Section of the General Affairs Department, has been reassigned by the bureau as the director of the Zhenjiang Hospital of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway, to allow him to fully utilize his talents.</p>

<h3 id="e188">Workers of the Da Zhong Rubber Factory Petition to Party and Government Agencies <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>The Da Zhong Rubber Factory on Singapore Road, Shanghai West, has over 300 male and female workers. The other day (13th), the factory, in order to oppose the workers' organization of a labor union, implemented a factory closure, preventing workers from entering the factory, causing a major dispute. The workers petitioned the Party, government, and Social Affairs Bureau to send personnel to thoroughly investigate. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>The Truth of the Dispute: According to the factory worker Gu Fengshan, speaking to a reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency, the workers of this factory and the Yi Yuan factory organized the Third District Rubber Union a month ago. The capitalists believed that once the union was established, the workers' interests would be protected and the capitalists would lose the opportunity to mistreat the workers. Therefore, a month and a half ago, Yi Yuan first implemented unjustified layoffs. Now, this factory is doing the same. On the morning of the 13th of this month, the factory closed its doors and posted a notice saying, "All departments temporarily suspend work." Then, it posted a notice dissolving all departments and urging workers to collect their wages. The workers believed that the factory's actions were actually meant to expel them and ignored the notices. The factory then stopped providing food and lodging for the workers. The workers, in this situation, had no choice but to request relief from the authorities.</p>
<p>Petition to the Party and Government: Yesterday morning at 10 a.m., the factory workers specially prepared a document and sent representatives Gu Fengshan, Qiu Haixiong, Chen Jianzhai, Xu Rongjia, Hu Jinbao, Shen Rongquan, Zhou Huihua, and over a hundred others, holding a banner that read "Petition Delegation of Da Zhong Rubber Factory Workers," first went to the Municipal Party Headquarters to petition, requesting that the factory be ordered to resume work immediately. Zhou Lianze, the chief of the civil training section, received them and promised to handle the matter together with the Social Affairs Bureau. Then, they went to the Social Affairs Bureau to petition, requesting immediate mediation to maintain the workers' livelihood. Wang Xianqing, a staff member of the Third Section, received them and promised to immediately send personnel to thoroughly investigate.</p>
<p>Sending Personnel to Thoroughly Investigate: The Social Affairs Bureau, considering that it was already May and to avoid the expansion of the situation, immediately sent Tan Peiyan, a staff member of the Third Section, at 1 p.m. to thoroughly investigate the truth and schedule a meeting between labor and capital representatives at the Social Affairs Bureau for mediation.</p>

<p>Social Affairs Bureau Mediation Yields No Result, Tobacco Workers Union Holds General Meeting Today</p>
<p>Over 7,000 workers from the No. 1 and No. 2 British-American Tobacco factories in Pudong are facing difficulty making a living because the factory has reduced work to only three days a week. Negotiations by the labor union have been unsuccessful. Last Thursday, all child laborers in the leaf tobacco department of the new Pudong factory stopped work. Workers from the No. 3 factory on Taopeng Road also crossed the river to petition. The Fifth District Cigarette Industry Union, fearing the expansion of the unrest, immediately reported the situation to the Party and government agencies, requesting mediation. The Social Affairs Bureau summoned representatives from both labor and capital to the bureau last Friday for negotiations. However, the factory's attitude was firm, and no progress was made. Yesterday (Monday), the new leaf workers had not yet resumed work. The foreign manager of the factory, "Lai Qisheng" (transliteration), directly consulted with the factory's representatives, but the workers were unwilling to work. The union believes that the situation is critical as both sides have taken extreme positions and has scheduled an emergency representative meeting for the 16th to discuss a solution.</p>

<p>Around 4 p.m. the day before yesterday, an unidentified male corpse, approximately 20 years old, was discovered in front of House No. 8 behind Kunshan Garden. The Hongkou Police Department was notified and dispatched Chinese and Western detectives to investigate. They found 76 silver dollars and reactionary documents on the corpse. The corpse was taken to the Feilun Road autopsy room, as previously reported. It is now known that the police found the address of the deceased's accomplices in the documents. Detectives went to No. 19 Matterhorn Road and arrested a suspect named Zhu Linqing, who was taken to the police station for temporary detention. Yesterday morning, Zhan Liangce, a prosecutor from the First Special District Court, was commissioned to conduct the autopsy. The autopsy confirmed that the corpse was the deceased, and Zhu Linqing was interrogated. Zhu Linqing confessed that he was from Anhui and did not know the deceased. He also stated that the house on Matterhorn Road was rented by his friend Lao Liu, whose name he did not know. He had only known Liu for a month. Liu had instructed him to live there, saying that a friend would come to him and ask him to take care of him, but he did not reveal the friend's name. Zhan deemed the confession credible and ruled that the unidentified male corpse died from injuries sustained from falling from a high place, resulting in head and leg injuries. As no relatives of the deceased could be found, the body was handed over to the Pushan Shanzhuang for burial.</p>

<h3 id="e199">Mr. Chen Binhe's Speech on National Humiliation Week: September 18th Incident <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>Speech given at the YMCA on May 11th</p>
<p>When talking about the September 18th Incident, we should first talk about Japan's policy towards China. However, Mr. Cai Yuanpei has already spoken about Japan's policy towards China a few days ago, so I won't say much about it here.</p>
<p>Before the Meiji Restoration, Japan was a feudal country. During the Meiji Restoration, it transitioned from a feudal system to a capitalist system, and from an era of isolation to a policy of imperialist expansion. Japan formed its capitalist country under the pressure of advanced imperialism.</p>
<p>In 1853, the American fleet broke through Japan's gates. The Japanese rulers were unwilling to let their country become a colony of the great powers, so they followed the great powers and embarked on the road to capitalism. However, Japan is an island nation, and general industrial construction under capitalism faces the difficulty of lacking raw materials in Japan. Therefore, the Japanese rulers determined two policies of external development in the early years of the Meiji era: one was the southward invasion marine policy, and the other was the northward expansion continental policy. Korea perished under the continental policy, and after that, it was our Northeast's turn. Japan's invasion of the Northeast did not begin with the September 18th Incident, but much earlier, decades ago. After the Sino-Japanese War in the Jiawu year, it broke through the barriers of our Northeast; after the Russo-Japanese War, it strangled the lifeline of our Northeast. For decades, the political and economic aggression of Japanese imperialists in the Northeast has planted deep-rooted forces, causing the mountains and rivers of the Northeast to change color invisibly!</p>
<p>When we talk about the September 18th Incident now, we should know why Japan wanted to launch it. The first motive for launching the September 18th Incident was: Japanese imperialists themselves are an island nation, and in order to develop their capitalist industry, the need for raw materials is very urgent, which has cultivated their ambition to plunder colonies. In recent years, the economic panic of the entire world has of course affected Japan, and various unstable conditions have appeared in society. In order to eliminate the unstable phenomena in the domestic society, and on the other hand, in order to prepare for the second World War, they need a supply of raw materials and a sales market, so they must occupy our Northeast by force! The second is: Japanese imperialism wants to prevent the economic power of the United States from invading our country. The strength of Japanese capital is of course not as strong as that of American capital. It wants to prevent American capital from penetrating our country, which is the mutual conflict between imperialist countries. The third is: Japanese imperialists saw that the Soviet Union's Five-Year Plan was about to succeed, especially the trend of successful industrial socialization in Siberia, which made Japan feel uneasy. The fourth is: China's political instability, coupled with the serious floods in the summer of the year before last. The fifth is the corruption of the Northeast warlords. With these five reasons, Japanese imperialists thought that it was an excellent opportunity to seize the Northeast at this time, so they launched the shocking tragedy on the evening of September 18th of the year before last!</p>
<p>We should also know the situation before the September 18th Incident: In the Wanbaoshan Incident on July 1st of the year before last, Japanese police helped Korean farmers seize the land of Chinese farmers. Chinese farmers refused and rose up to resist, and the Japanese police opened fire and shot Chinese farmers. From July 3rd to 8th, Japan even more planned to instigate Koreans to launch anti-Chinese riots, killing 142 overseas Chinese in Korea, injuring 546, and property losses amounted to more than 4 million Japanese yen. At the same time, they also used the disappearance of Nakamura, a soldier who disguised himself as a spy in the Northeast, as an excuse to launch the Shenyang Incident on September 18th!</p>
<p>After September 18th, Jilin, Heilongjiang, and Jinzhou were also occupied by force; the Tianjin Incident occurred twice on November 8th and 26th; the Shanghai Incident on January 28th of last year; the puppet state of Manchuria was established on March 1st of last year; on December 8th of last year, the Japanese army provoked trouble without reason and shelled Shanhaiguan, and on January 1st of this year, they attacked Yuguan for the second time, and Yuguan was lost again on the afternoon of January 3rd; after February 25th, they attacked Rehe, and Rehe was lost again on March 3rd!</p>
<p>These are some of the biggest things after the September 18th Incident. We still remember them very clearly, so I won't go into detail.</p>
<p>Our current feelings:</p>
<p>The first is that when the September 18th Incident occurred, Zhang Xueliang invented the extremely shameless non-resistance doctrine! Zhang Xueliang could not understand the cause of the September 18th Incident. After the September 18th Incident, he once expressed to others that Japan's invasion of the Northeast was the action of a few Japanese ambitious people and could not represent Japan's entire policy, so his claim was wrong.</p>
<p>We know that Gandhi in India after its fall still made non-violent resistance. Zhang Xueliang is a soldier but advocates non-resistance. If we ask Zhang Xueliang, if other domestic soldiers had sent troops to the Northeast at that time, would he have resisted? I think he would have resisted! Not only would he not want others to seize his territory, but he would not want others to take away his personal belongings at will. But when he left, he had to take away tens of millions of cash and borrow ancient paintings from the Summer Palace in Beiping. This is a painful feeling after the September 18th Incident.</p>
<p>The second feeling is: the so-called "long-term resistance." From non-resistance to long-term resistance, there is not a single achievement made. The so-called "long-term resistance" is really unprepared and has no overall plan! This kind of long-term resistance is equivalent to non-resistance! We know that Jinzhou was lost without resistance; Yuguan was lost without resistance; Rehe was also lost without resistance. The 19th Route Army and 5th Army in the January 28th Incident, as well as Ma Zhanshan and Su Bingwen in the Northeast, and the Northeast Volunteer Army, all resisted without an overall plan and were defeated by the Japanese one by one.</p>
<p>We still remember that after the Sino-Japanese War in the Jiawu year, the local government of Guangdong at that time asked Japan to return the captured warships, saying to the Japanese military authorities: We did not participate in this war, please return the Guangdong warships. This incident was criticized by foreigners, saying that Japan was not at war with China, but with the Qing government; Japan was not at war with the Qing government, but with Li Hongzhang alone! Isn't the resistance of Ma Zhanshan, Su Bingwen, the 19th Route Army, and the Northeast Volunteer Army just Japan fighting with Ma Zhanshan personally! With Su Bingwen personally! Japan is only fighting with a part of the 19th Route Army! (To be continued)</p>

<p>Gathering Strength to Assist the Government in Saving the Nation from Peril</p>
<p>Connecting the Middle School Education Community to Jointly Seek Appropriate Progress</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Middle School Teachers' Union yesterday issued a letter soliciting opinions from middle schools across the country on the organization of a National Middle School Teachers' Union. The original text is as follows: To the faculty and staff of middle schools across the country: Today's China is on the verge of destruction. Internally, the communist bandits are rampant in the southern countryside, collapsing without any remainder; externally, the Japanese invaders are swallowing up our Northeast, and the powerful nations are all coveting our market. The country is shattered like this, something never seen before in our history. The tidal wave of global economic panic will lead to the outbreak of a second World War. In this boiling cauldron, the nation's survival hangs by a thread, and yet many of our compatriots are still sound asleep. Although patriotic people are everywhere, they suffer from a lack of unity and are ultimately unable to shoulder the heavy responsibility of saving the country. They can only watch as the government struggles, internal worries become increasingly serious, and external troubles intensify. The Association is aware of this and believes that if our compatriots across the country rise up quickly to jointly avert the crisis, how can the country's future be considered? In particular, our colleagues in the education sector are outstanding members of the country. After ten years of recuperation and ten years of education, the responsibility of saving the country must be at the forefront. For more than ten years, the student community has been enthusiastic about the patriotic movement and has achieved some success, but our middle school teachers and staff have not made any statement. Shouldn't we feel ashamed? There are no less than a thousand middle schools across the country, and the number of middle school teachers and staff is even uncountable. However, we have never heard of any organization, let alone anything else. The rise and fall of the country is the responsibility of every citizen, let alone us outstanding intellectuals? Moreover, at this time of deep water and scorching fire, saving the country through education is a fundamental plan. In particular, secondary education connects the past and the future, and its mission is especially important. Seeing this, the unity of our middle school teachers and staff is an urgent task at present. In order to meet the urgent needs of the environment, the Association has initiated the organization of a National Middle School Teachers' Union in order to: 1. Gather strength to assist the government in saving the country from peril and strive to survive; 2. Connect middle schools across the country, which have no organization, to jointly seek the advancement of education. Colleagues of middle schools in various places who sympathize with this proposal are earnestly requested to come to the Association to jointly plan for unity and strive for survival.</p>

<p>Hoping Siam Treats Overseas Chinese Equally</p>
<p>According to the Kwok Man News Agency, the Siam Education Delegation, which came to China to investigate the state of education, arrived in Shanghai a few days ago. Yesterday (the 15th) at 8:00 AM, members of the delegation, such as Phya Wisutra, Secretary-General of the Siam Ministry of Education, Chen Wentian, President of the Siam Chinese-Language Kuo Min Jih Pao, and overseas Chinese businessmen Chen Yian, Lin Weilie, and Liu Lengqiao, and seven others visited Jinan University in Zhenru. Zheng Hongnian, the president of the university, and all the faculty and students warmly welcomed them. After the memorial service, they introduced Phya Wisutra, Chen Wentian, and Liu Lengqiao to speak about the significance of their visit to the country and the situation of overseas Chinese in Siam. Later, Yang Yufen, the secretary-general of the university, accompanied them on a tour of various parts of the university. The Siam Overseas Chinese Student Association and the Nanyang Cultural Enterprise Department of the university also held a tea party at No. 5 Yuntao Hall. President Zheng hosted a banquet at 12:00 noon on the third floor of the Guanshengyuan Restaurant on Nanjing Road, and invited reporters from various newspapers to attend. During the banquet, President Zheng delivered a speech briefly describing the close relationship between China and Siam in history, almost like brothers. He said that in the past ten years, Siam's politics have been on track and the country has made great progress in everything. China expresses its deep sympathy. The current Siamese government's increase in overseas Chinese donations and compulsory education regulations are actually detrimental to overseas Chinese in various ways. He hoped that the Siamese government would treat our overseas Chinese compatriots equally, and that our overseas Chinese compatriots would also be able to help the Siamese government to promote the progress of Siam. The friendship between the Chinese and Siamese peoples should be based on the communication of education and culture, and we should work hard from this point. Phya Wisutra replied in English, saying that he would report his good impressions of his visit to China to his government and request that it reduce the time for teaching Siamese in Chinese schools as much as possible, so that Chinese students can learn more Chinese.</p>

<p>Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday | Plans to Stay for Two Days</p>
<p>The Henan University Education Delegation set off from Kaifeng at the beginning of last month, passing through Dingxian, Beiping, Tianjin, Jinan, Zouping, Nanjing, Zhenjiang, Wuxi, Suzhou, and other places, and arrived in Shanghai last night. They are staying at Shanghai Middle School. There are a total of twelve male and female members, led by their professor, Dr. Tai Shuangqiu. The delegation has three goals: to visit school education, to investigate rural education, and to promote the local products movement. There are five aspects to their work: advocating local products to save the country, visiting famous schools, investigating practical education, investigating rural construction, and collecting rural economic research data. It is planned that after returning to Bian, they will conduct an experiment on an "education village" near Kaifeng, based on an economic perspective, and integrate education into economic construction. It is also reported that when Mr. Tai lectured on the local products movement in various places, the audience was very moved and many shed tears. In Wuxi, he also proposed that various places automatically organize "Nian Er Societies," with the aim of promoting local products, practicing social frugality, striving for social production, and working together to save the Chinese nation from danger and solve the people's livelihood from the 22nd year of the Republic of China. Comrades in various places are communicating and soliciting opinions. The general communication office is located at Henan University in Kaifeng.</p>

<p>Lin Meiyan, Chen Weiyi, Ye Guanqian, and others, in view of the current need for production education, invited like-minded comrades to establish the Dagong Industrial and Commercial Vocational School in Qiaojiabang, Nanshi, and hired Chen Guofu, Chen Lifu, Zhang Daofan, Wu Kaixian, Wu Xingya, Tao Baichuan, Wang Yansong, Tong Hangbai, Cai Tonghao, Gu Nanqun, Zhang Zaibo, Lu Jingshi, Jiang Huaisu, Shen Xingfan, and Huang Zhaoxiong as members of the school board. They have first established industrial and commercial departments and have been approved by the Municipal Bureau of Education to establish a school board. The First District Party Department has allocated a school building with a surrounding area of more than ten acres. Preparations are currently underway, and it is expected that classes will begin in August or September.</p>
<h3 id="e213">Xinya Middle School Moves to a New Location <a href="#e213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>Principal Min Ganghou and Xue Weiting of Xinya Middle School, located at No. 133-136, North Sichuan Road, near the Hengbang Bridge, have been carefully managing the school and its facilities, gradually achieving perfection. Now, because the original school building is insufficient and various facilities are often constrained, they have specially selected two Western-style buildings in the vicinity of the same road as the new school building. The location is quite spacious, with gardens and sports fields, which are extremely suitable for a learning environment. They are currently engaged in arranging the facilities and will be able to move in and start classes within this week.</p>

<p>No Less Than Five Hundred Water Enthusiasts</p>
<p>The Hongkou open-air swimming pool, established by the Shanghai Municipal Council, opened at 6:00 AM yesterday. The reporter arrived in time and saw a sea of heads (exposed on the water surface), no less than five hundred. Water enthusiasts such as Yin Yanjun, Yu Binqi, Wang Jianxin, and Bao Lengxue were as vigorous as in previous years, circling endlessly in the pool. Unexpectedly, the weather did not cooperate, with thunder and lightning and heavy rain. If it were any other sport, it would have ruined the fun, but in this case, there was no worry at all. They even regarded it as a fountain bestowed by heaven and instead increased the fun a lot. Ordinary water enthusiasts were even more active. The most ridiculous thing at this time was a drowned chicken that jumped in from the door. Although it had not yet swam, it was no different from those in the water, as these people had already received the grace of God halfway through. Today is Tuesday (according to the regulations, tickets are 50 cents each, and three tickets are one dollar, but on Tuesdays and Fridays, they are sold at a reduced price of 20 cents). It is expected that the number of people going to quench their swimming thirst will be several times more than yesterday.</p>

<p>Women's Team as Official Championship Adding 1000m Steeplechase and Women's Javelin, Deadline for Registration in All Countries is May 29th</p>
<p>The third Shanghai International Games have been decided to be held on June 3rd and 4th at the China Athletic Field. Yesterday, the Association convened a meeting of representatives from various countries at the YMCA. More than ten representatives from various countries were present, and Chairman Shen Siliang recorded the resolutions as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e231">Conference Dates and Registration Period <a href="#e231" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c231" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">231</a></h3>
<p>The conference dates were set for June 3rd and 4th. If it rains, it will be postponed for one week to June 10th and 11th. The registration deadline is May 29th, Monday, at 6:00 PM at the China Sports Association. When the date was decided, the German and Russian representatives said that it conflicted with the rowing association date, but because changing it later might be too hot, they expressed sympathy but could not agree.</p>
<h3 id="e232">Women's Team as Official Championship <a href="#e232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>In the past two years, the women's team was only an exhibition game. Starting this year, it will be an official championship competition with the same events, but adding the javelin event. There was an initial proposal to add the discus event, but the javelin was considered more suitable, so it was adopted. The events are 50m, 100m, 200m, relay, high jump, long jump, and javelin.</p>
<h3 id="e233">Add 1000m Steeplechase and Women's Javelin <a href="#e233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>The women's team will add the javelin event. In the men's team, there was an initial proposal to add the 1000m steeplechase, but it was finally decided to temporarily make it an exhibition game. Mike McKenna was recommended to plan everything because Mike has a lot of experience in this area. The exhibition date is June 3rd. Although the steeplechase is one of the world's Olympic events, it is rare for Chinese people to practice it.</p>
<h3 id="e234">Cancel Individual Participation <a href="#e234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>Cancel individual participation. All must participate on behalf of their country. Even one athlete can represent the country.</p>
<h3 id="e235">Prizes Not to Exceed 20 Yuan <a href="#e235" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c235" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">235</a></h3>
<p>The prizes for the Games are too extravagant and lose their true meaning. In order to promote true technical competition, it was decided that the silver cup for the first place should not exceed 20 yuan (the previous year was 50 yuan). The prizes for the second, third, and fourth places are medals.</p>

<h3 id="e243">Children Demand Novelty <a href="#e243" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c243" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">243</a></h3>
<p>— Xuan</p>
<p>The newspaper on the 10th of this month carried an advertisement from the Children's Bookstore, stating that someone was "infringing on legal interests" under the name of "New Children's Bookstore." The legal interpretation of this matter is not the focus of this article. What we should pay attention to is that the promotion of children's books in the book industry is also very competitive.</p>
<p>The result of business competition should be improved products. However, we often only see imitation and crude manufacturing. Thirty years ago, Chinese children's books only included a few volumes such as "The Catless Country." Now, in addition to bookstores specializing in publishing children's books, large and small bookstores are printing a large number of children's books. In terms of "quantity," it is undeniable that there is progress, but can the "quality" be satisfactory? In the past, when there were only fairy tales such as "Thumbelina" and "The Catless Country," there were no "comic strip novels," so those few fairy tales were "exclusive." Now, the number of children's books is thousands of times greater, but it cannot prevent the ubiquitous "comic strip novels." On this point, the new book industry and the authors of children's books should reflect deeply!</p>
<p>There are now perhaps 10,000 different kinds of children's books of varying levels, but "comic strip novels" number at most only a few hundred. However, the latter's circulation and appeal far exceed the former. This phenomenon is alarming. Most of today's children's books are literary. They can be roughly divided into three categories: one is simple stories about cat brothers and dog brothers, either translated, written, or adapted from Chinese folk tales; the target audience is children aged seven or eight. The second is more complex, but the themes are mostly still in the first category, with occasional historical legends and myths. The third is translations of Western literary classics, such as Treasure Island. According to this classification, we know that the first and second categories have differences in complexity but no essential difference. The third category suddenly jumps higher, especially in terms of language. If the first and second categories are suitable for children aged eight to ten, then the third category is suitable for first or second year junior high school students aged fourteen or fifteen. Therefore, children aged twelve or thirteen simply have no books to read. I believe this is one of the reasons why "comic strip novels" are so popular among fifth and sixth grade elementary school students.</p>
<p>Secondly, although there are many of the first and second categories of books mentioned above, the content is very thin. Whether it is a Western story or a domestic story, it is the same old stuff that everyone uses, resulting in identical content. Therefore, even seven or eight-year-old children feel a lack of reading material. "Just a few stories copied over and over!" Seven or eight-year-old children are dissatisfied with new books. So he also learns from his older brother and starts reading "comic strip novels."</p>
<p>Therefore, as far as elementary children's books are concerned, the current problem is not a shortage of books, but rather that the content of the books is repeatedly copied and lacks fresh themes. This is exactly the opposite of the problem with advanced children's books!</p>
<p>Returning to the Children's Bookstore. The Children's Bookstore does not publish many books, but in my opinion, it has one characteristic: the 101-volume Children's Science Series. In today's market flooded with literary children's books, the mere 101-volume Children's Science Series can be considered a drop in the bucket. If someone follows suit and competes in this area, it might not be a bad thing, as long as they are willing to seriously hire people to write and not crudely manufacture, imitate, and profit.</p>
<h3 id="e244">Digging Underground Shelters <a href="#e244" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c244" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">244</a></h3>
<p>— Da Wu</p>
<p>When Japanese planes arrived in Peiping, our army still said, "Resist to the end." Naturally, the people had no choice but to flee quickly. Tickets for the Pingpu Railway increased by more than double the usual amount in one day, and even more the next day. The station was extremely crowded. This was truly a booming business!</p>
<p>But some people did not flee and instead dug underground shelters. The elementary schools in Peiping, in order to ensure the safety of their students, sent representatives to the Social Affairs Bureau to petition and suspended classes for half a day to dig underground shelters (Shen Bao, Peiping Special Dispatch, 11th). The content of the petition probably wanted to ask the authorities to include the elementary school students in the fifth batch of antiques being packed and transported, and to take the train south. It is pitiful that the antiques have already been transported in five batches, but the elementary school students have only just dug underground shelters, preparing to burrow underground to escape. Compared to the fact that some people copied wills, copper boxes, stone boxes, built pagodas, and treasured things before the Japanese planes followed the antiques south, what are our feelings?</p>
<p>But I remembered the Japanese army's retreat from Luandong a few days earlier. Some people speculated that the reason for the retreat was one of three: first, the Japanese army's forces were not strong, and our army's defense was solid; second, the war was approaching foreign interests in Luandong; and third, the strategy was changed to threaten Tianjin and Peiping. But I myself speculate that the dwarfs were imitating Dong Shi, trying to "lure the enemy in deep."</p>
<p>But at that time, it was said that the refugees in Luandong were returning one after another, "and gradually resuming business" (Shen Bao Special Dispatch, April 29), and the newspapers also carried "breaking," "expelling," "advancing," "recapturing," and "occupying" and other joyful words in large and small characters. It was as if the Chinese people had gone from a miserable life to a good life, although under the protection of foreigners, it was also the result of our army's resistance against Japan.</p>
<p>However, the great cause of resisting Japan is difficult to predict. The newspapers clearly carried "recapturing" and "occupying," but suddenly it "clearly did not match the facts." It turned out that our army only had "very few troops going to 囗囗 and other county towns to maintain local order and safe traffic" and did not "attack the Japanese army." Therefore, as soon as the enemy provoked, Dolon fell, Japanese planes arrived in Peiping, and elementary school students dug underground shelters, like rabbits, escaping underground.</p>
<p>Now is the time to save the country through aviation. With airplanes, it is naturally quick to escape. But it is inconvenient to drag many elementary school students along, so we have to dig underground shelters, bury them underground, for safekeeping. Although the Japanese bombs are fierce, what can they do when the Chinese people escape into the sky and dive into the earth, and even the antiques have already been transported clean, leaving only a few young children in the underground shelter?</p>
<h3 id="e245">Coal <a href="#e245" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c245" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">245</a></h3>
<p>— Zhou Lengjia</p>
<p>The Huangpu River, the turbid river water flows continuously all day long. The Goddess of Peace statue on the riverside frowned and looked down. The artillery positions of an aircraft carrier were aimed at her.</p>
<p>Machines are roaring, motors are vibrating, and the small coal worker is carrying a basket of coal weighing one hundred and twenty pounds on his shoulder.</p>
<p>The sky is overcast, the air is full of moisture, and the air pressure is low, making it difficult to breathe.</p>
<p>"Hang yu! Hang yu!" A burst of depressed cries squeezed out, broke through the gloomy air on the riverside, and several tanned, muscular arms were raised upwards. A heavy basket of coal was pressed onto Afu's shoulders again.</p>
<p>Afu, a young man who was squeezed out of the countryside, has been working as a coal carrier on the riverside for two months.</p>
<p>For two months, he has been carrying coal from trucks all day long, carrying it in a running posture, to the tall riverboats. The coal baskets are heavy, pressing his back down and making his ribs ache faintly, but he still has to carry it, still has to move it.</p>
<p>The woman on the billboard, smoking, is leisurely looking at him with a smile, laughing at him for being stupid. Yes, he is stupid, but if he is not stupid, he will not have anything to eat. Poor humans are destined to squeeze out their sweat and blood to exchange for food.</p>
<p>Sweat is flowing, blood is flowing, and his ribs are aching. No one pities him, only those baskets of coal, as if they are against him, are constantly transported by trucks to the riverside to weigh down his shoulders.</p>
<p>It seems that there is an endless amount of coal produced in this world, and he will never be able to transport it all in his lifetime.</p>
<p>"Hey, what a mess! Four cents a day, I have to carry more than a hundred baskets of coal. One day, I'll be crushed to death!" Sometimes he really can't stand it anymore, and he will grumble a few words, but when he thinks of life, when he thinks of the pain of being hungry, he finally just swallows a mouthful of saliva and quietly gathers his strength, squats down, and waits for his companions to lift a basket of coal and press it onto his shoulders. He is content, he does not hope to have any delicacies in his mouth, he just needs a few big pancakes, fried bread sticks, and glutinous rice balls a day.</p>
<p>His dreams are comfortable, he does not hope to have any woman in his arms, he just needs a place to sleep, whether it is a slum or an open-air cement floor, he will fall asleep peacefully.</p>
<p>But, unfair things finally came to him.</p>
<p>One day, just as he was carrying coal onto a riverboat in a running posture, his foot suddenly stepped on a banana peel on the riverbank and slipped. As a result, a basket of coal weighing one hundred and twenty pounds fell down and pressed on his back, covering him with coal dust. The force of this pressure was really not light, making the inside of his body feel as if he had been stabbed with a knife, and he involuntarily spat out a mouthful of blood.</p>
<p>He raised his head and looked towards the boat. On the deck of the riverboat, there was a young couple leaning against the railing, talking passionately, while peeling bananas and putting them into their mouths, as if they didn't know that a tragic scene they had created was happening under the boat.</p>
<p>He couldn't help but take a breath of cold air, and a surge of anger surged:</p>
<p>"Damn it! I'm really going to die, just to make you two happy!"</p>
<p>But he didn't dare to run up and hit them, to take revenge. He just endured the pain and climbed back to the slum where he lived.</p>
<p>That night, he was in so much pain that he clutched his chest and cried out, shedding tears all night.</p>
<p>The next day, when his companions continued to go to the riverside to do the coal carrying work as usual, Afu was nowhere to be seen. No one knew where he had gone.</p>
<p>One day, two days, the days flew by like arrows, and Afu was never seen again. Only everything on the riverside remained the same: the Goddess of Peace was frowning and looking down, the woman on the billboard was smoking and smiling, the sirens on the riverboats were roaring, the roof of the Sassoon Building was shining with golden light, and other small coal workers were still working in the cloudy sky and gloomy air.</p>
<h3 id="e246">Ramblings from the Qu Cottage <a href="#e246" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c246" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">246</a></h3>
<p>— Zizhan</p>
<p>(28) Pacify the Interior? Resist the Exterior?</p>
<p>The late Qing authorities were ignorant and incompetent. In foreign affairs, they did not hesitate to cede power and humiliate the country, while in domestic affairs, they feared the expansion of civil rights. On the one hand, they strongly rejected the earnest requests of the constitutionalists, and on the other hand, they brutally suppressed the revolutionaries. The members of that group harbored the selfish desire to "rather give to friends than to family slaves," believing that pacifying the interior was more important than resisting the exterior. In the end, because the exterior could not be resisted, the interior became even more difficult to pacify, and the Qing Dynasty collapsed. I believe that the demise of the Ming and Qing Dynasties was the same. The national policy of the late Ming Dynasty was defeated by corrupt officials. Factional strife arose frequently, seeking to satisfy personal desires: strong enemies were not resisted, and making deals was the plan. When the Manchurian soldiers swept through North China and approached Jiangnan, the small Nanjing court still had disputes over pacifying the interior or resisting the exterior, and they could not agree. The treacherous officials Ma Shiying, Ruan Dacheng, and others strongly advocated prioritizing pacifying the interior and suppressing the rebellious forces of Zuo Liangyu. The military strength in Jiangnan was insufficient, so they even withdrew troops from Jiangbei to defend against foreign aggression to reinforce it. At that time, the Manchurian soldiers were advancing south day by day. Yao Sixiao, the Vice Minister of the Court of Judicial Review, and the censors Qiao Kepin and Cheng Youqian requested that the Jiangbei troops not be withdrawn and that Yangzhou be defended urgently. Shiying scolded loudly: "You Donglin, you are still using Jiang Defense as an excuse, wanting to let the rebellious Zuo invade? If the northern soldiers arrive, we can still negotiate a deal: if the rebellious Zuo arrives, then you high officials and our emperor will die alone." Sixiao and others, fearing severe punishment, dared not discuss resisting foreign aggression. The defenses of Huaiyang became weaker, and the Manchurian soldiers marched straight in, massacred Yangzhou, captured Nanjing, and captured King Fu. It can be said that the Ming Dynasty died because it specialized in internal warfare and did not resist foreign enemies. Pacify the interior? Resist the exterior? The authorities are confused, but the bystanders are clear. We were born after the Ming and Qing Dynasties, and when we discuss why the Ming and Qing Dynasties perished, why should we worry about having no words to write?</p>

<p>Lepique had almost finished his bread. This time, Agathe didn't let him get ahead. She focused all her attention on Lepique, forgetting everyone else, until Mrs. Lepique coldly said:</p>
<p>"Agathe, what are you doing?"</p>
<p>That's what reminded her.</p>
<p>"I'm here, Madam," Agathe answered.</p>
<p>She watched Lepique even more intently. She wanted to conquer him with her solicitude, and try to get his attention.</p>
<p>She didn't miss the opportunity.</p>
<p>When Lepique was chewing the last bite of bread, she rushed to the sideboard, took a ring loaf weighing five kilograms that hadn't been cut, and offered it to him very sincerely, feeling very pleased with herself for guessing the master's need.</p>
<p>But Lepique took off his napkin, left the table, put on his hat, and went to the garden to smoke.</p>
<p>When he had finished eating, he wouldn't eat any more.</p>
<p>Agathe stood there holding the five-kilogram ring loaf, as still as a wax figure advertising a life raft factory.</p>

<p>"This upsets you," Carrot Hair said to Agathe when only the two of them were left in the kitchen. "But don't be discouraged, there are even more upsetting things to come. Where are you taking those wine bottles?"</p>
<p>"To the cellar, Mr. Carrot Hair."</p>
<p>Carrot Hair said:</p>
<p>"I'm sorry, only I'm allowed to go into the cellar.

I can tell the difference between the red and blue labels on the wine bottles in there.</p>
<p>"I sell the small wine barrels we've used, getting a little extra money, and I sell the rabbit skins too. I give the money I make to Mum.</p>
<p>"Let's get this straight now, to avoid hindering each other later when we're working.</p>
<p>"In the morning, I let the dog out and give him breakfast. In the evening, I whistle to call him in to sleep. When he wanders around and comes back late, I have to wait for him.</p>

<h3 id="e248">Gold Swap Market Heats Up with Higher Bidding, Jumping to 0.3 Yuan <a href="#e248" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c248" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">248</a></h3>
<p>This Round of Swap Trading Opens with Bullish Side Pushing Forward by 0.12 Yuan</p>
<p>The gold market yesterday saw the swap trading market heated with short covering. Initially, the market was stable due to ample supply, with many speculators selling USD due to perceived lack of profit from swaps. Bidding was active. Towards the end, Ruixing, acting on behalf of Jewish merchant George Joseph, was most active in covering shorts, with news that a certain speculator bought heavily from Yifeng Yongyou. Market sentiment remained firm. In the morning, the market opened high due to a drop in overseas silver markets. The exchange market was initially stable, trending downwards, with HSBC initially quoting the British pound unchanged and the USD slightly lower at 0.0125. Subsequently, the market gradually rose. Fellow traders actively bought US dollars. Reuters reported that the Indian government planned to sell silver, causing market sentiment in Bombay and major trading centers to shift towards decline. Later, short covering activity increased, leading to repeated rises. HSBC's second quote saw both the British pound and USD rates lowered by 0.025, further firming the market. The market fluctuated with swap trading, with the premium unexpectedly rising from within 0.10 yuan to over 0.14 yuan, posing a significant threat to short sellers. Urgent short covering pushed the price through 0.80 yuan. Spot prices added 0.48 yuan. Forward trading of May/June swaps saw many transactions at 0.22 yuan. This round of premiums ranged from 0.08-0.09 yuan to 0.14-0.15 yuan. The market situation for the day is recorded below.</p>
<p>The morning opened at 964 yuan, up 5.4 yuan from the previous close. Goods opened at 0.038 yuan. The exchange market opened with tight British and American rates. The near-term selling price was 1 shilling 2 and 8125/10000 pence for the British pound and 24.5625 yuan for the US dollar. Maoyong came in selling, and Huabi filled June US dollars at 0.06875 for 0.025 yuan, but market sentiment remained stable. Fuchang and Hengyu both advanced, raising the price to 0.045 yuan. Meifeng continuously offered August US dollars at 0.00625. Bulk sales from the Dalian group continued to decline. HSBC again offered July US dollars at 0.00875. Hengyu and Fuyu sold again, retreating to 0.005 yuan. Mitsui bought September US dollars at 0.0025 and returned to over 0.02 yuan. HSBC quoted the British pound unchanged and the US dollar lowered by 0.0125. At the time of the announcement, the market hovered around 0.02 yuan. Although McCalle filled August US dollars at 0.0025 yuan, the purchase by Tongyi Ruixing caused a reversal and rise. Shortly after, Huabi bought August US dollars at 0.0025 yuan. Zhaofeng Chang, Yifeng Yong advanced to 0.049 yuan. Although Zhengchang Hengyu offered, Zhifeng Yong repeatedly advanced, keeping the market stable. Sanjing offered August US dollars at 0.0025 yuan, which was difficult to settle. Maoyong and Yuanxing Yong both advanced, causing a rise. Later, June US dollars at 0.05625 and August US dollars at 0.00875 were both difficult to settle. Richang Zhifeng Yong Fuyu continuously bought up to over 0.08 yuan. Although the market retreated due to sales from small accounts, Huabi suddenly took in August US dollars at 0.00875. Ruixing Yongfeng advanced to over 0.08 yuan. Huabi ate June half yuan. Fuchang further advanced to 1 yuan. Huabi offered July at 0.0625 for 0.078 yuan. Later trends were very firm. Anticipating that HSBC would announce a reduction of 0.025 for the British pound and US dollar, Dadecheng aggressively bought, pushing the price past 0.70 yuan. Huabi and Mitsui both ate August US dollars at 0.00375. Ruixing and Cuitai advanced to 0.72 yuan. Goods were sold to 0.005 yuan. Finally, Shenkang Fuyu advanced to over 0.03 yuan. Huabi offered August US dollars at 0.00625, pausing slightly. Because August US dollars at 0.00625 were difficult to settle, Zhifeng Yong Ruixing Yuanheng Yifeng Yong Qingfa Yong Hengyu all bought up to 0.78 yuan. Shortly after, the noon close was 977.8 yuan, and goods were bid at 0.075 yuan.</p>
<p>The afternoon market opened at 978 yuan, and goods opened at 0.078 yuan. Zhifeng Yong Hongli Xieheng Yong Richang all sold, dropping to within 0.06 yuan. Tianfeng Yong also sold off. Shortly after, Huabi filled July US dollars at half a yuan. Zhifeng Yong Hongli sold again, dropping to within 0.05 yuan. The exchange market trended looser. Shanghai Hefeng even offered August US dollars at 0.00625. Hengyu Shunli aggressively sold off, retreating to 0.025 yuan. Anda ate August US dollars at 0.06875, stopping the decline. September US dollars at 0.08125 were once difficult to offer and hovered around 0.03 yuan. Swap trading began, rising from 0.08-0.09 yuan to 0.10 yuan. Short covering led to a rise to 0.06 yuan. Thereafter, prices rose and fell with swap trading. Dadecheng aggressively offered. Mitsui again bought August US dollars at 0.06875, rising to over 0.08 yuan. Fuyu Xianghe Tongfeng Heng further advanced to over 0.80 yuan. Qianchangxiang advanced and then offered, retreating from 0.81 yuan to 0.787 yuan. Zhongfu bought July US dollars at half a yuan. McCalle again took in August US dollars at 0.0625. The exchange market was in urgent need of swaps, adding up to over 0.14 yuan, pushing the price to 0.817 yuan. Mitsui filled August US dollars at 0.06875. Wanxing sold off, and the Dalian group swapped in, with the premium once returning small and retreating to 0.791 yuan. Yuanheng Yongfeng came in buying, but the premium remained large. The closing price was 981.7 yuan. After the market closed, swap trading reached 0.15 yuan, with a shortage of bulls. The bulls once pushed the price to 0.86 yuan, returning to 0.84-0.85 yuan. This was due to urgent short covering by small accounts and pessimistic short sellers. Maoyong and others again advanced, raising the price of goods. The highest price of the day was 781.7 yuan and the lowest was 60.05 yuan, a fluctuation of 21.2 yuan. As a result, the price rose 23.1 yuan compared to last Saturday.</p>
<p>The listed price was reduced by a total of 0.0375 by HSBC's US dollar quote, calculated at 24 yuan. Gold price of 1,000 yuan was received according to the closing price, approximately 0.18 yuan lower, 0.0772 yuan less than the previous close. This month's ledger was 1006 yuan. June was 978 yuan. The morning top-up was 1006 yuan, and the afternoon was 1010 yuan. The scalded red price was added by 0.48 yuan. Taikang Run sold over 700 taels to Yingfeng Heng for spot trading, with delivery in approximately one week. It was heard that a large amount of spot goods arrived in port the day before yesterday.</p>
<p>Swap trading (May-June) from Futaiheng to Qianchangxiang was 210 contracts at a price of 0.22 yuan. This round (June-July) initially opened at 2:15 pm, with the bullish side calling for a premium of approximately 0.10 yuan. This was because HSBC's US dollar quote was approximately 0.22 yuan lower. Initially, Zhifeng Yong Dadecheng offered to the Dalian group in small quantities. At this time, the Dalian group pushed the bullish side forward, but the bearish side aggressively offered, so the price gradually rose from 0.09 yuan. Daxing Yong Dadecheng Hengyu Fuyu all came to offer. At this time, Shenkang Yuansheng Yong and others limited their trading, struggling at approximately 0.10 yuan. Hengyu Qingfa Yong Tianfeng Yong Fuchang offered up to 0.11-0.12 yuan. Dadecheng vigorously offered. Qianchangxiang also sought a bullish side. Wanxing came back to offer at 0.13 yuan. Yuanheng Yuanmaoyong advanced, slightly cheaper. However, Yifeng Yong Qianchangxiang offered again and rose to 0.135 yuan. Yuanxing Yongchang Shengyong advanced. The official opening was 0.122 yuan. Dadecheng and others aggressively offered, once rising to 0.143 yuan. Chunyuan Yong and others advanced, returning to 0.122 yuan. Finally, Fuyu offered at 0.14 yuan. After the market closed, the price continued to rise to approximately 0.15 yuan. In summary, the bullish side with the Dalian group Chunyuan Yong Yuanheng advanced the most. The bearish side with Qianchangxiang Dadecheng Hengyu Daxing were slightly the strongest. May contracts were still profitable (as of the previous day) at 3283 contracts.</p>
<p>Morning trading was strong, and afternoon trading was light. This was also due to swap trading. Short covering was still dominant. The largest inquiries were from Yicui Tai Ruixing Yifeng Yong Zhaofeng Chang Fuchang Yuanxing Yong Dadecheng Fuyu Zhifeng Yong Yuanheng Qingfa Yong Shenkang and others. Dalian group Shunli Hengxing Hongli Xieheng Yong Wanxing Runchang Yu Hengyu and others offered. Yongfeng Tongfeng Heng Dadecheng and others offered and then advanced. It was rumored that Yifeng Yong advanced on behalf of a certain speculator for a large amount. In fact, there were only over 400 contracts. Jewish merchant George Joseph (Ruixing) covered shorts for approximately over 1,000. The total number of June contracts (as of last Saturday) was 14,385.</p>

After opening, the market was initially flat and then tightened. Banks filled, but the gold industry aggressively bought, gradually softening the market. By the noon close, the market had tightened approximately 0.000125 (British pound) and 0.04375 (US dollar) from the opening. This was because the HSBC listing also reduced the British pound and US dollar rates by 0.025 each. There were not many transactions in the afternoon. By the close, the near-term selling price of the British pound was 1 shilling 2 and 6875/10000 pence, tighter by 0.00025 from last Saturday. The US dollar was 24.25 yuan, tighter by half a yuan.

<p>Short Sellers Too Numerous, Decline Light</p>
<p>Yesterday, the atmosphere in the Chinese Securities Exchange was quite tense. The precarious situation in Tianjin and Peking, along with the unfavorable circumstances in Luanxi, where Tangshan was also in danger and Miyun was under pressure, brought about a major change. However, after experiencing several dangers, people have become more aware of the changes in bonds. Bulls with inadequate capital were wary of following blindly. As a result, the "Run" (a type of bond) was easily calmed. Given yesterday's situation, a sharp drop was possible, but the initial selling by various groups only resulted in a small decline of 0.06-0.07 yuan. Although the second round continued with a small decline of 0.01-0.02 yuan, several groups managed to recover 0.02-0.03 yuan, as northern short sellers seized the opportunity to cover at lower prices, relying on their lifting power. When the afternoon market opened, short covering continued, with number 23 especially eager to buy, pushing the price up by around 0.03 yuan. The market closed due to news of a new emergency in Tangshan, and morale waned. The market was chaotic, with mixed gains and losses of 0.01-0.02 yuan. For many days, the closing price often showed inconsistent gains and losses, indicating the public's anxiety. Despite the extremely tense situation in Tianjin and Peking, the market price did not experience a major slump, mainly because there were too many short sellers. However, if the war in Tianjin and Peking were to break out, the panic of the bulls would be inevitable. The market price resulted in a slight drop of 0.02-0.03 yuan to 0.05-0.06 yuan. The total trading volume was 11.02 million yuan, including 27,000 yuan in spot goods, 2.27 million yuan in salt tax, 2.11 million yuan in disarmament bonds, 1.84 million yuan in consolidated tax, 1.12 million yuan each in 19-Customs and 20-Customs bonds, and the remaining amounts ranged from several tens of thousands to one hundred and twenty thousand. 200 shares of the Exchange were traded at a price of 45 yuan.</p>

<p>Xinfeng Foreign Firm Report: Last Saturday (13th), New York stock market usually saw bulls take profits on weekends, with major stocks falling by around 2 yuan. Half-day trading volume was 2,274,000 shares. Railroad freight for the week ending May 6 totaled 523,819 vehicles, a decrease of 11,857 vehicles from the previous week. The Bureau of Statistics announced that domestic cotton consumption in the United States in April was 470,658 bales, compared with 366,491 bales in the same month last year. Cotton exports from August last year to the end of April this year totaled 6,521,000 bales, compared with 7,397,000 bales in the same period last year, a sharp decrease in the Far East. According to the New York consignors and special financial institutions of this bank, the basis for the current stock market rise has shifted from expectations of inflation to the bright and optimistic prospects of commerce. However, fluctuations are inevitable during the upward process. As for cotton, due to the higher British exchange rate and the upcoming formal opening of the disarmament conference and the World Economic Conference, the market situation will be two-sided. However, since the harvest report has not improved in any way, and commerce is gradually brightening, there is no risk of decline. The Dow Jones Index is listed below:</p>

<p>The yarn market is trending firm, with a relatively high price. The cotton market is rising, causing the related yarn market to pick up. Some factories are willing to completely stop night work due to difficulties in storing yarn, so more people are taking bullish positions every day, and the buying sentiment is suddenly strong. Given the conditions in the cotton market, the yarn market is expected to continue to rise. However, due to the declining domestic social and economic situation, yarn sales are still difficult to develop fully.</p>

As raw cotton prices rose, the market atmosphere strengthened again, with each month rising by 0.08 yuan to 0.1 yuan. In the afternoon, it was reported that a certain manufacturer would collect and transfer the futures that he had thrown out, and people were nervous. At the same time, 1,200 bales of spot yarn were traded, with each month rising by 0.1 yuan to 0.12 yuan. The total trading volume for the day was 72,100 bales.

<p>The cotton market is rising, and the situation is very firm. Foreign cotton is difficult to obtain, and the rising gold price makes foreign cotton calculations more expensive. Therefore, speculators generally tend to buy and take bullish positions, and it is said that the inventory of domestic cotton is weak, and sellers do not have enough chips to deliver. Therefore, there are many buyers when prices fall. However, factories have a calm attitude.</p>

<p>(Wuxian) Suzhou's Hushu Pass, Hengjing, Mubin, Xukou, and other areas are famous silkworm breeding areas with numerous seed production farms. In recent years, although silkworm farming in neighboring counties has failed due to unfavorable weather conditions, Suzhou's silk production has not been too bad, thanks to the assistance and guidance of students from the Hushu Pass Girls' Sericulture School and the Suzhou Agricultural School. This year, many farmers are raising improved breeds. The number of silkworms being raised in Renqiao and Xincun areas, which have cooperated with the Suzhou Agricultural School, has increased compared to last year. The weather is sunny and warm, and development is smooth. The early batch of silkworms has been fed leaves for many days, and the late batch is still beginning to sleep. There is no market for mulberry leaves.</p>
<p>(Shangyu) In recent years, farmers have been discouraged by the failure of silkworm farming. This year, there is a panic in the rural economy, and there is no need to buy seeds. They have all borrowed funds from the township public offices to purchase improved breeds for breeding. However, the silkworms are not developing well. The number of silkworms being raised in townships such as Zhangzhen and Shangpu is relatively large. The early batch has been fed for three sleeps, and then released to eat leaves. The late silkworms are still in the second sleep. The mulberry trees in the four townships are producing abundant leaves, and the supply exceeds demand. The price of leaves is surprisingly cheap, only 0.3-0.4 yuan per load. In another week, all the silkworms will be ready to spin cocoons.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the Xiehe, Yihhe, Jinlong, Baochang, and other firms in Wenzhou, which sell low-grade Zhenmei green tea, all started selling. There was no increase or decrease in prices. The local Zhenmei tea from Huzhou, Xiaoshan, and other regions has a slight outlet. However, the market has fallen by 0.04-0.05 yuan. The market for Chun'an Zhenmei tea is even more sluggish. British trading companies rarely ask for prices. This situation is very similar to last year. Regardless of whether the quality of the tea itself is good or bad, it is difficult to sell at a high price. This is due to the global economic recession, and the competition from cheap Japanese tea is also a significant factor.</p>

<p>The market in Shanghai South, with 40-50 suppliers, is still weak for both retail and wholesale sales, with the situation seemingly collapsing. The bleak scene is unprecedented in recent months. Speculators are still watching from the sidelines, as if the market has not yet bottomed out. If they act, they will not be satisfied unless the price is lowered. The ideas of buying to cover the gap in supply are not well-prepared, and people's minds are not firm as the abandoned lunar New Year approaches. As for bulk purchases, although they continue to move, the number is still only a little over a thousand bags. Northern Ping-Peiping firms are buying high-quality Northern Qing, Xinghua, and Fuzhou, while other firms are buying mid-grade thin rice. As a result, high-quality materials are still able to hold steady due to a lack of supply, while mid-grade goods are subject to harsh eating habits, and the market price has fallen again. According to statistics, Sutong japonica and Nangang rice prices have softened by 0.01-0.02 yuan. The thin rice from Qingjiao, Songsi, Xilian, and other places is more expensive, while the inferior ones have been reduced by 0.02 yuan. Duyang pointed root japonica rice has a slight corner and is not affected by the shade change.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market in Shanghai North, with approximately 50-60 suppliers from Hexia, saw that the white japonica rice was lazy and stagnant. The price of thin japonica rice also fell by 0.01-0.02 yuan. Early rice was slightly cheaper by 0.02-0.03 yuan. The supply of Yangjian rice was also strong, with sluggish sales and prices slightly cheaper by nearly 0.01 yuan. There was a lack of customer-pointed rice, and the fatigue was nearly a corner.</p>

<p>Yesterday, after the flour market opened in the morning, the prices for each month fell consistently. Foreign wheat quotations fell by about 0.01-0.02 yuan. However, most people have paid attention to the harvest of domestic wheat. Recently, the weather has been good, and there was rain the other day. The estimated harvest rate in the areas of river south is about 80-90%, and the harvest rate of the 2nd grade wheat areas is about 70%. The situation in the north is getting worse and worse. The follow-up sales will inevitably be hit, so people's minds are not firm after opening, with the price falling one point compared with the previous day's closing price. By the time the afternoon market opened, the market atmosphere was still flat. The current month had once broken the 0.04-yuan mark. Initially, long-term prices fell sharply due to unloading by both small and large factories. Subsequently, prices saw a slight recovery due to some floating air compensation. However, given the current situation, if the wheat harvest is good, and the flour sales are not prosperous, the degree of decline may be inevitable. As a result, the current month fell 1.5 points compared with the closing price of the previous week, June fell 1.25 points, July and August fell 0.02 yuan, September fell 1.7 points, and October fell 0.02 yuan.</p>

<p>Yesterday, after the wheat market opened in the morning, the prices for each month showed a downturn. The prices of foreign wheat have declined, and the weather is excellent, with hopes of a bumper harvest of new wheat. The opening prices for July, August, and September were 0.02-0.03 yuan lower than the previous week. The opening price for October had less of an ups and downs.

<p>Since sesame has been actively traded through foreign firms, the market sentiment has been unusually lively, and the continued interest from foreign firms has made people feel even more anxious. Yesterday, the Bao Long Foreign Firm bought 200 tons at a price of taels 7.8, equivalent to $10.092 per unit, a rise of two mace compared to the previous day. The reason is that the net cargo inventory is low, so the market is still able to hold its ground. There is still trading of soybeans from inland mills, and the factory side is temporarily adopting a wait-and-see attitude. Fortunately, the source is not surging, and the market situation is still stable.</p>
<h3 id="e269">Sugar Market Raw Sugar White Surges Two Mace <a href="#e269" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c269" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">269</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market saw a slight rise in bid prices and an increase in customs duties. In addition, the prolonged stagnation in sales has created a turnaround situation, so the market is tight. The guild set the base price for 24 raw sugar white at $20.50, and later some transactions were made at $20.04, a sharp increase of two mace from the previous day. No price was set for the 20, but the market price should be around $19.80. 89 Dutch red was quoted at $16.40, and later some transactions were made at $16.03, but very few were sold, indicating a tight supply. The Taikoo refined white B mark was quoted at $21.85 to $21.90. The factory price was that Changxing Firm sold RA cotton Dutch white at $21.55, and a slightly inferior grade at $20.065. Guanghua Factory also offered the Lu character at $20.055 and the Shou character ground sand plus broad package at $20.08, which were eagerly received. In the afternoon, due to the rising customs duties, the guild set the base price for 24 raw flowers at $20.04, but few were willing to accept it. The factory prices for various sugars also tightened, with prices quoted up by two mace. Zhenji also offered a batch of No. 1 cotton white at a price of $20.02, an increase of three mace from the previous day. Guangshan gangs offered more than 200 pieces of Hainan red at prices ranging from $13.45 to $13.50. More than 100 packages of Zheng Mian red were priced at $15.12, and the inferior grade at $15. A Chaoqing gang offered around 200 packages of Zhuangqing, initially asking for $13, but later settled at $12.90, followed by $12 to $11.50.</p>

<h3 id="e270">Wu Proverbs: Casual Notes <a href="#e270" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c270" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">270</a></h3>
<p>— Shanlu</p>
<p>In Wu proverbs, derogatory terms for people have varying degrees of severity! For example, to criticize someone for being dirty, simply saying "dirty" is a mild derogatory term; going a step further is "dirty inside dirty," which becomes a severe derogatory term. To laugh at someone for being muddled, simply saying "muddled" is a mild derogatory term; going a step further is "muddled inside muddled," which becomes a severe derogatory term. By analogy, simply saying "amateur," "awkward," "clumsy," "long-winded," 「Note」 are all mild derogatory terms; if the intensity is increased, they become "amateur inside amateur," "awkward inside awkward," "clumsy inside clumsy," "long-winded inside long-winded," all becoming severe derogatory terms. From this, I have derived a formula: whenever an adjective is repeated with the addition of the character "inside," it indicates unsatisfactory criticism and is not applicable to satisfactory criticism. There is only "dirty inside dirty," not "clean inside clean"; only "muddled inside muddled," not "clear inside clear"; only "amateur inside amateur," not "professional inside professional"; only "clumsy inside clumsy," not "neat inside neat"; only "long-winded inside long-winded," not "concise inside concise." It is evident that even common sayings and idioms have certain textual rules.</p>
<p>Satisfactory criticism transforms a two-character adjective into a four-character adjective, using only a reduplication method. For example, "dry and clean," "clear and refreshing," "neat and tidy," "simple and concise" are all adjectives transformed from two to four characters. This usage is also applicable to unsatisfactory criticism; one can say "dirty inside dirty," and also "dirty dirty"; one can say "muddled inside muddled," and also "muddled muddled"; other cases can be deduced by analogy. 「Dirty dirty," "muddled muddled" are only mild derogatory terms; slightly different from the severe derogatory terms "muddled inside muddled" and "dirty inside dirty."</p>
<p>"Note" The common term for lengthy speech is "long-winded"; in fact, it is merely a mispronunciation of "intertwined," "long-winded inside long-winded" is equivalent to "intertwined inside intertwined"; "long-winded long-winded" is equivalent to "intertwined intertwined."</p>
<h3 id="e271">So Modern <a href="#e271" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c271" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">271</a></h3>
<p>— Yimei</p>
<p>The comedian Xu Zhuodai, signing his name to humorous and delightful works, resided in Hongxingfang, Zhabei, and thus called himself "Xu Gong of Zhabei," cleverly replacing the "city" character of "Xu Gong of the North City." Later, Zhuodai moved to Jiangwan, and Xu Bibo lived near Hengbang Bridge, so he ceded the title of "Master of Zhabei" to Bibo, also signing "Old Xu the Half-Old" and "Master of the Broken Night Kettle Room," all of which were enough to elicit laughter. Recently, he has even called himself "Modern Old Man," which is also quite wonderful.</p>
<p>In Suzhou, there is a village called Hengjing. The local people's pronunciation of "dong" is like "deng," "feng" is like "fen," and "tong" is like "teng." The maid hired by my family is from Hengjing. Coincidentally, the maid living opposite is also from Hengjing. Knowing each other in a foreign land, they are unusually close. This morning, I was still in bed, reluctant to get up, when I heard my family's maid talking to the maid living opposite in front of the door. I was upstairs, separated by a window, so I couldn't hear clearly what they were talking about. I only heard my family's maid opening her mouth to say "modern," and closing her mouth to say "modern." The maid living opposite also used "modern" in her sentences. I couldn't help but be greatly surprised, thinking that the word "modern" is the catchphrase of fashionable people. Could it be that these women from remote villages also understand the accents of fashionable people? Upon closer listening, I realized that it was not the case. It turned out that today the one who empties the chamber pots was on strike and did not come, causing the excrement to overflow and be difficult to dispose of. The maid was anxious about this and worked hard to solve the chamber pot problem. "Modern" is the Hengjing people's pronunciation of "chamber pot."</p>
<h3 id="e272">Poor Talk <a href="#e272" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c272" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">272</a></h3>
<p>— Yongzi</p>
<p>"Not afraid of ferocity, only afraid of poverty." Poor people are worth less than Pekingese dogs in the world. Unexpectedly, someone is afraid of them. It is truly an honor that one never dreamed of.</p>
<p>That's right. The "Imperial Army," which was fiercely invincible during the Battle of Shanghai, was defeated by a few hand grenades. Only those who have been poor their whole lives, once they become traitors, are like June stink bugs and mosquitoes, making people shudder at the sight.</p>
<p>There are many examples in the world of people being afraid of the poor. One cold day, a friend and I were walking along a certain road when suddenly a poor man wearing torn clothes followed my friend, addressing him as "old pal." Although my friend denied it vehemently, he eventually dug into his pocket. From then on, he dared not walk that road again, saying he was afraid of running into that poor kid again.</p>
<p>Indeed, poor people, having no other way to go, are capable of anything. If soft tactics don't work, hard tactics will. First comes a blackmail letter, then kidnapping and ransom, not afraid of the big shots with puffed-up chests and protruding bellies.</p>
<p>The proletariat has already been tainted with seven parts poverty. If the proletariat loses their jobs again, they will be completely poor without any discounts, making them fearful to others, thus standing tall and firm. Therefore, civilized countries around the world have to rack their brains to find ways to solve the problem of "unemployment relief." Even your esteemed Republic of China is loudly promoting plans for "rural revitalization" because farmers are extremely poor.</p>
<p>"Unemployment relief" and "rural revitalization" are for what? To be blunt, isn't it because they are afraid of the "poor" rebelling?</p>
<p>However, to be poor enough to make people afraid, one must at least be poor to the point of recklessness and disregard for life. Like me, even though I am shameless enough to talk "poor talk," I am still unwilling to risk my life. If one is unwilling to risk one's life, no one will be afraid. Among the readers, there must be like-minded people who, like me, want both money and life, so they should never dream of being touched by "poverty" and making others afraid.</p>

<p>Chapter Six: Sweet and Bitter Love Scene, Coldly Observing Both Sides, Treacherous Worldly Path, Secret Agreement for Three Years</p>
<p>Guizhi lowered her head, playing with the copper spoon, and said, "I feel I'm much more open-minded now. If it were two years ago, you could have killed me, and I still wouldn't have come to a coffee shop." Jizhi said, "Thank you, thank you, I'm glad you're willing to do me the honor, but I hope you'll do me the honor to the end." Guizhi said, "What do you mean by doing you the honor to the end?" Jizhi leaned his arms on the table, looked at her with a sincere expression, and said seriously, "It's easy to understand, it's about what I'm asking for…" Then he smiled and said, "That's not how to put it, it's about what I said earlier, the three-year agreement. What do you think about that? Please give me a definite answer. If you can wait, that would be wonderful. But if you say the worldly path is treacherous…" Guizhi raised her chin and said, "There! You're saying that again. If you're sincere, what does it matter if the world is treacherous? I'll just follow this path, cross the barriers when they come, and cross the bridges when they're there, and see where it leads. You haven't even started, and you're already afraid you can't get through? That won't do! Alright! I know what you mean." As she spoke, she stood up, pushed the bowl and copper spoon in front of her forward, and stood up, holding the table. Her face was tight, facing the door, as if she were about to leave. Jizhi quickly stood up, went to the door, and blocked her, saying, "Please don't be impatient, let's talk it over slowly." Guizhi said, "I've been out for so long, I'm afraid my mom will call me, I have to go back and check." Jizhi stretched out his hands and blocked the door, saying, "But we haven't made a decision yet. Can you sit down for five more minutes? Or have another cup of tea like that day?" Guizhi frowned and said, "I really have to go back, I can't delay. Didn't you say we'll talk it over slowly? That's easy, we'll talk it over slowly." Seeing that she was always facing outward, without turning around, and that blocking her way like this might make her think he was forcing her, Jizhi said, "If you have something to do, I won't insist, but we haven't finished talking today. Maybe tomorrow, maybe the day after, we can come here and talk again, what do you think?" Guizhi nodded and said, "Okay." (71)</p>
<h3 id="e274">Fashion of the Times <a href="#e274" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c274" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">274</a></h3>
<p>— Ke Ding'an</p>
<p>Today, when the nation is in crisis, we, the general public, are trying our best to find ways to save the country, like "saving the country through aviation," "saving the country through military affairs," and even "saving the country through dance" and "saving the country through entertainment." I believe that the most important and crucial thing is "saving the country through domestic goods," which everyone can practice without any preparation or training. The public only needs to hold the firm belief that "I will only buy domestic goods from now on." Slowly, from near to far, one person does it, a hundred people follow, and the entire nation practices it in the same way. Then domestic goods will become widespread throughout the country, producers will produce endlessly, and consumers will buy endlessly. At that time, our economy will be strong, and all foreign aggressions will naturally disappear.</p>
<p>The China National Products Company, which aims to save the country through domestic goods, has seen that people in modern centers always seek foreign goods for clothing. If this is not used as a lesson, the sales of foreign goods will only increase in the future. Therefore, they resolutely held a fashion show that shocked all of Shanghai. They invited many movie stars, such as Hu Die, Xu Lai, Gao Qingping, Ai Xia, Xuan Jinglin, and Hu Ping, Gu Haijun, and other ladies to perform the fashion show. During the three-day session, no less than 30,000 of Shanghai's noble ladies participated. It was truly "fragrant clothing and beautiful hairpins, and a myriad of wonders."</p>
<p>In the fashion shows performed by the stars, their clothing materials were made of silk, wool, and cloth. The types of fashion included coats, long gowns, short coats, vests, Western suits, and various original clothing. The most striking was the short black satin top and semi-long pants worn by Hu Die, trimmed with white and red interwoven lace. The collar was a pull-over style, and the pant legs were also trimmed with the same lace. The waist was tied with a red, white, and black interwoven silk belt, which had an oriental flavor. When she came out, the applause was like thunder.</p>
<p>Xu Lai wore a dress made of red and white willow pattern georgette on top and red and yellow large floral georgette on the bottom. The shoulders were covered with lotus leaf-style capes, and the waist was pleated. Walking around, she could stretch her feet very well. It was also suitable for everyday wear. Ms. Ai Xia's long coat and short vest, and Gu Meijun's fine-waisted, chest-knotted, bare-shouldered dress also revealed a natural beauty. Xuan Jinglin's white satin long dress and Hu Ping's light green Indian silk bare-shoulder short-sleeved clothing all expressed their personality.</p>
<p>It is said that this fashion show "used silk, wool, and cloth to make more than 90 sets, costing more than 3,000 yuan." I know that such great publicity will surely win the sympathy of noble ladies and will no longer buy foreign goods.</p>

<h3 id="e275">Dramatized Educational Films <a href="#e275" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c275" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">275</a></h3>
<p>Film is the eighth art. The reason why it is listed after painting, music, dance, drama, sculpture, novels, and poetry is that its history is shorter than other arts, but its impact on society is greater than any other art. Therefore, all Western countries are doing their best to operate the film industry. Italy and the Soviet Union are using films to promote various new constructions.</p>
<p>The decline of Chinese culture and the prevalence of illiteracy are undeniable facts. Eliminating illiteracy is a major obstacle to building a new China, but eliminating illiteracy cannot be done in a short period of time. To achieve quick results, one can only start with film. I believe that film is a powerful tool for transforming society and an instrument for promoting culture.</p>
<p>In the past, filmmakers regarded film as a form of entertainment for people to pass the time, so they only sought to cater to the low-level psychology of the general audience. In fact, film is not just for entertainment; it must contain educational and cultural significance. Recently, filmmakers have realized the great mission that film bears to society and have abandoned the "martial arts" and "supernatural" films that are guaranteed to make money, and have come to produce anti-feudal and revolutionary films. Undoubtedly, they have made a significant change in the selection of film scripts.</p>
<p>In the work plan of the China Educational Film Association, there is a concrete provision for the mission that film should bear. Its outline is: (A) Promote the national spirit. (1) Show the advantages of Eastern culture; promote the glory of Chinese history; (3) Show the process of the national revolution. (B) Encourage production and construction. (1) Shift from urban to rural areas; (2) Promote completed constructions; (3) Promote uncompleted constructions; (4) Indicate undeveloped resources. (C) Instill scientific knowledge. (D) Promote the revolutionary spirit. (1) Promote the spirit of sacrifice and struggle; (2) Promote the spirit of hard work and endurance; (3) Promote the spirit of service and creation. (E) Establish national morality.</p>
<p>In their work plan, they also plan to produce educational film scripts, one is textbook-style educational films, and the other is dramatized educational films, but because the cost is huge, it is difficult to implement them temporarily. I believe that in fact, film companies may not be able to produce textbook-style educational films. As for dramatized educational films, film companies can produce them. These educational films are still based on the principles of promoting the national spirit, studying production and construction, instilling scientific knowledge, and establishing national morality, and are not boring and tasteless didactic films. Therefore, dramatized educational films must emphasize both the fun of drama and the significance of education. The recent sound film "Vitality" by Tianyi Company is an example.</p>
<p>"Vitality" depicts a woman's struggle and fully promotes the spirit of "sacrifice, struggle," "hard work, endurance," and "service, creation." It does contain educational significance, but the moving story and the beauty of the techniques are also very rich in dramatic interest. (Feng Ju)</p>
<h3 id="e276">A Corner of the City <a href="#e276" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c276" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">276</a></h3>
<p>Yearning for the city seems sweet, but entering the city is like entering a sea of bitterness. According to sociological principles, the city is originally a malformed organization. Needless to say, everything in the city naturally presents a malformed state. Therefore, after we have this understanding of the city, we must conduct an investigation. How can we improve the lives of those already in the city? In other words, what is the inner layer of the city?</p>
<p>It is very clear that in a corner of the city, women who are oppressed by the environment often have a pure heart, ready to enter society to serve and make a living. But what is the result? They are seduced, abandoned, and their bodies are stained with shame that can never be washed away. Women's liberation and equal employment are restrained by demons, and a layer of darkness is added to the city, turning the whole into a pitch-black mass.</p>
<p>Many of my female classmates have left school and flowed into this path. Where has reason gone? They only care about enjoying themselves, and they probably won't wake up until they are old and haggard!</p>
<p>Yesterday, I accompanied my girlfriend to watch the latest Sida Tong sound film "Lipstick Market" by Mingxing. It was truly beyond my expectations. I felt that the consciousness of this film was completely based on the points mentioned above, and it was active, optimistic, and very inspiring to us. At the same time, it is also worthwhile for me to mention and introduce it at the end of this article.</p>

<h3 id="e277">Japanese Planes Flying Over Beiping and All Kinds of Things <a href="#e277" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c277" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">277</a></h3>
<p>— Wu</p>
<p>Japanese imperialism can be said to be extremely bold. In China, they have repeatedly formally declared, "If the enemy comes to attack me, I will definitely resist," and that this is a "consistent policy that will never change." Under such a strong attitude, they dare to openly send planes to Beiping to drop bombs after occupying Rehe and Duolun. This not only proves the "atrocities" of Japanese imperialism, but also makes us doubt whether our government's "declarations" are enough to scare the enemy into submission.</p>
<p>On the morning of the 11th, around 7:20, Japanese planes certainly did reconnoiter over Beiping once, and incidentally scattered leaflets. According to a Central News Agency report, "Our troops in the area used anti-aircraft machine guns to fire," so "they did not dare to descend," and even "fled towards Yongdingmen for fear of being shot." Since it is a Central News Agency report, it is certainly very reliable, and the fact that our troops "fired" a volley is enough to increase national prestige. However, according to the same day's Reuters report, "The mystery surrounding the clouds in the sky this morning has deepened even further." The report stated, "The Japanese Embassy claims that it cannot confirm nor deny whether Japanese planes have flown over the skies of Beiping." We certainly do not need to believe the Japanese Embassy's lies, but "the reports from various sources regarding the anti-aircraft artillery are also inconsistent, and even 'foreigners who witnessed it did not hear the sound of artillery.'" This really makes our peace-loving people shake their heads and sigh. Is it necessary for our troops to brag about firing a few cannons? Fortunately, the same report also said, "According to our Air Defense Command, in view of the fact that enemy planes dare to harass Beiping, it has actively deployed air defense measures to protect Chinese and foreign residents. At the same time, the foreign side is deeply dissatisfied with the enemy planes' arbitrary reconnaissance of Beiping, a city and not a military zone, and will raise questions to the Japanese side" (as reported by the Central News Agency on the same day). This way, the people of Beiping can rest assured, and the people of the South can rest even more. Moreover, the above sections can be confirmed by the telegram of the 12th:</p>
<p>1. Enemy planes flew over Beiping again this morning. "Whenever enemy planes flew over the streets, our anti-aircraft artillery machine guns and rifles concentrated their fire." And residents all "looked up from their beds" and can testify.</p>
<p>2. "Enemy planes flew at an altitude of more than 2,000 meters, avoiding our fire."</p>
<p>3. "A shell landed in the courtyard of the actor Zhu Qinxin, fired by our anti-aircraft artillery. A shell also landed on the roof of the Xiaoxia Daily, breaking the tiles."</p>
<p>4. As a result, the enemy planes gained nothing and even "retaliated once," scattering a round of "absurdly worded" leaflets before leaving.</p>
<p>Someone may ask, "Why did our troops only fire from the rooftops and not send up planes for a large-scale air battle?" Then this person is too confused. Didn't Zhang Xueliang go to Mussolini to study the secrets of fascism? Weren't his Ford airplanes given away as gifts? What else is there? Otherwise, there would be no need for Boy Scouts to engage in aviation fundraising on the streets in the sweltering heat.</p>
<p>[P Cat&gt;</p>
<p>— Yu</p>
<p>My wife especially likes cats. After our pet cat drowned last year when I was slightly ill, she got another almost completely white cat. It was snow-white all over, with only two shallow gray spots the size of copper coins on its back. She made a small quilt for it and laid it flat in a specially made wooden box. Every night before going to bed, she would drowsily call it in, gently grab it into the wooden box, and then be able to sleep peacefully. Later, it also knew the scheduled time. When the time came, it didn't need to be called. It would already be sleeping obediently in the wooden box, with its head and limbs curled up together, and its back rising and falling slightly. The shallow gray circle was also quite beautiful, rising and falling. My wife clapped her hands and said, "That cat is really good. People are not as obedient as it!" After saying that, she tilted her head to look at my attitude, as if saying, "Do you know what this means?" At this time, I was probably writing or reading – this has become my habit. After dinner, I always chatted with the people living in the same house. After the cat went to sleep in the wooden box, I realized that it was time for me to write or read. I wouldn't go to sleep until eleven or twelve o'clock. My wife went to sleep very early. When she saw that I wasn't going to sleep early, she said playfully that I wasn't as obedient as the cat. Seeing her tilting her head and smiling triumphantly, I deliberately said, "People are not as smart as cats!" "Yes!" She thought that I didn't know her playfulness and laughed happily.</p>
<p>This cat became a member of our small family.</p>
<p>The spring breeze awakened the earth. One night, the lovely cat disappeared. My wife searched and called everywhere, but she couldn't find it. She said anxiously, "Whoever stole my cat will die a horrible death!"</p>
<p>I knew that after she lost every beloved thing, she would always say that to feel comfortable. That night, she sat silently beside my desk. Unexpectedly, she went to bed with me at one o'clock. In bed, she was still pouting as if she were angry with someone. I gently kissed her lips and said, "What's wrong?" At the same time, a "meow..." sound came from the roof. My wife pushed me away and sat up.</p>

<p>"It's Ah Bai!" she said definitively.</p>
<p>She pushed away the covers, wanting to get out of bed, but I grabbed her hand and said, "Are you going to climb on the roof? It will come back on its own tomorrow!"</p>
<p>"Mew..." The cry gradually approached. This strangely unpleasant "sound" seemed to awaken my wife, who smiled and re-entered the covers. I casually said, "Annoying spring, I'm too lazy to even touch a woman's bottom!"</p>
<p>I received a light punch on my thigh.</p>
<p>The cat's belly slowly swelled, and my wife busied herself preparing a maternity ward. Two weeks ago, it gave birth to two kittens as lovely as their mother. My wife was overjoyed, holding Ah Bai as if she were something precious. The box was moved under our bed, and we watched it nurse. We often held and played with the two kittens. Yesterday, when we returned from the Confucius Temple Park, we didn't know where Ah Bai had moved the two kittens. My wife spoke to Ah Bai as if coaxing a child, but Ah Bai was ultimately not as obedient as a person, and remained confused, not answering. It didn't sleep in the wooden box at night either. I said to my wife:</p>
<p>"You've become a puppet! Once it has children, it forgets you. It's better not to listen!"</p>
<p>"Bah! I'll definitely find it tomorrow."</p>
<p>"Mew..." This morning, the cry came from the roof again. My wife opened the window and looked at Ah Bai, her face showing disappointment.</p>
<p>"Mew..." From this rooftop to that rooftop.</p>

<p>— Gan Xiu</p>
<p>This is what people call 'Paradise' Night!</p>
<p>Neon Lights illuminate its dazzling, seductive red and green lights. In the space, glittering buildings stand tall. On the asphalt road, a surging, turbid tide of people and cars flows. So many people are rushing as if they have important matters to attend to! Streams of sweat flow straight down, overflowing with that pungent odor! Disregarding everything!</p>
<p>That mysterious cabaret, filled with the aroma of coffee, emits loud laughter from the door seams: the mellow taste of cocktails; the vibrating melodies of waltzes. Thus, a group of street voyeurs crane their necks, peeping and eavesdropping, with expressions of envious jealousy, tirelessly waiting until the uniformed patrolman treats them with a wooden club!</p>
<p>Outside, on the bustling sidewalk, many frivolous young men, like bees and butterflies, follow behind every young and beautiful woman, whistling lewdly and flirting passionately. Then, the young and pretty girls return a flirtatious glance and a clever smile; or they curse softly, pretending to scold!</p>
<p>Moreover, in the shadows of quiet buildings, a contrasting tragedy is being enacted upside down. Look! Behind every man, whether white-haired, grown-up, frail, strong, well-dressed, or simply attired, there always follows one or more women: plaster faces, dull eyes, stiff, corpse-like bodies. An old madam follows them gloomily. When the arc lights of a speeding car flash across their thin faces, every face remains expressionless!</p>
<p>In order to satisfy the greed of the madams, to satiate the animalistic desires of men, and for their own survival, they are forced to endure the extreme punishment of being slowly sliced to pieces. There is no joy or comfort. The stones of misfortune circle above their heads, and those stones strike their heads at any time and any place. When they lose the last of their youthful beauty, that is the moment when the stone of misfortune strikes them fatally.</p>
<p>At this time, perhaps someone is praising the greatness of the metropolis, and especially the greatness of the metropolis at night!</p>
<p>And coincidentally, hidden within the atmosphere of this great city's night is a tragic and cruel fate!</p>
<p>This is what people call 'Paradise' Night!</p>
<h3 id="e281">Male Students in Shanghai <a href="#e281" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c281" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">281</a></h3>
<p>— Er Chu</p>
<p>I remember a few days ago, someone wrote an article in this journal called "Female Students in Shanghai," which was extremely thorough. I am simply writing an article called "Male Students in Shanghai" to promote gender equality. Mimicking others is inevitable.</p>
<p>The term "male student" evokes a mystical fantasy, especially among middle school and university students. Indeed, those neatly dressed in Western suits and leather shoes, carrying original Western books several inches thick under their arms... Ah! All of that quickly floods into the mind.</p>
<p>Parents spend huge sums of money to send them to school, and the nation cultivates them earnestly. What is the purpose? What exactly do they do at school to live up to themselves and others? Have they recognized this turbulent era? Have they shouldered the important current mission they should bear?</p>
<p>Alas! It is painful to say! Most male students are still fooling around with themselves. Needless to say, they are deceiving themselves and others. They waste a lot of money in vain, and the result is that they gain nothing. Instead, they become infected with the extravagant and wasteful Europeanized habits, and they also have a conceited heart. Their will is weakened, their spirit is scattered, and they remain drunk and numb, passing their days like walking corpses. When they have nothing to do, they either play a few decadent tunes or hum a few nauseating poems. Running around to movie theaters and dance halls is their daily life. When they can't stand living, they "commit suicide" a few times, and they can be called "patriotic suicides" and show off their "death." As for what they learn and what the national crisis is, they can put it all behind them and wait to have some fun before talking about it (?) because the Japanese devils are still far away in the north!</p>
<p>A few good-looking and beautiful students also do some "anti-Japanese association" things, giving a speech on the podium; of course, they are righteous and confident, and the audience is shocked. They say "go to the national crisis together" and "young students can no longer be numb"... After leaving the podium, they remain the same. They still go to the dance hall to watch movies in the evening. They are not ashamed to be the leaders of "saving the country with movies" and "saving the country with dancing" (?)</p>
<p>Occasionally, the damned professor wants to give a surprise test, which is terrible! It really worries our young master students. They can only pretend to be Liu Bei for the time being. But it doesn't matter, after a while, they are Zhang Fei on the sports field!</p>
<p>Oh! Students are the future masters of the country? They are the backbone of society? They are the leaders who lead the people? They are the pioneers of political reform? They are... Alas! Great male students! I want to be speechless!</p>

It is presumed that their intention is simply to hope to be published in the newspaper; however, a detailed analysis of the content of the problems does not have much to do with the general public. If we follow the instructions and publish them one by one, not only will readers inevitably lose interest, but there is no space to accommodate thirteen or fourteen letters per day. It is hoped that future letters will be handled in accordance with the regulations of this column, especially the address must be clearly stated, otherwise, we will not reply, please understand.</p>

<h3 id="e284">The Life of the Five Concubines (9) (Continued) <a href="#e284" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c284" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">284</a></h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>She looked towards the bed, Grandpa Zhang was still sleeping like a pig. Originally, she should have gone over to get a blanket to cover him, but because she was too lazy to move, she let it go.</p>
<p>At some point, Grandpa Zhang finally woke up. He was bound to give his little beauty sleeping next to him some gentle care, and naturally said a lot of sweet words, but Miss Liu did not seem to be moved in any way, which was naturally very disappointing. But Grandpa Zhang always had good intentions, and the most obvious was his determination to rescue her from this brothel's fire pit. The solution was that he himself only had a wife of many years, and according to his status, he should have a concubine. So Miss Liu was naturally sufficient to occupy this position.</p>
<p>Miss Liu listened very carefully to the passionate words. Logically, she should have been excited, but she was unwilling to specifically state her opinion, always responding with "Hum, hum, hum." This directly made our Grandpa Zhang unable to figure out what was going on. Afterwards, Miss Liu stayed awake until dawn. Probably because of insomnia, her head was very swollen and painful. She struggled to get up, drank a cup of cold tea, and walked to the window, looking at the gray sky. She sighed heavily, thinking in her heart:</p>
<p>"Alright, I'll just marry him."</p>
<p>(9) In Happiness</p>
<p>Since Miss Liu agreed to Grandpa Zhang's request that night, after several negotiations, Miss Liu actually married over.</p>
<p>According to Wu Gui, Miss Liu did not seem particularly happy about this matter. However, Mother Yang from the brothel took this opportunity to make a fortune, which was true. Not to mention anything else, in terms of her value alone, the original asking price was 1,200 yuan, but Grandpa Zhang was only willing to pay 600. Of course, the difference was too much. In the end, it was agreed that 800 yuan would be paid. However, there were also the four-color gifts that Grandpa Zhang sent to Mother Yang, which were not included: a fox fur coat, a pair of large gold earrings... Although they were all readily available to Grandpa Zhang, and he only had to take them from his own pawnshop, but calculated, they were also worth two or three hundred yuan. However, every time Mother Yang talked to others, she always said that she was doing good deeds and didn't want to ruin a young girl, so she sold her off cheaply. If she had kept her for a few more years, she was sure that she could have made a lot of money.</p>
<p>But there are really things in the world that make it impossible to understand the reason. For example, Grandpa Zhang spent so much money to marry Miss Liu this time, and logically, he should cherish her like a treasure. However, in fact, it was not so. Apart from sleeping in her room from time to time for more than a month at the beginning, he did not take her with him when he took office this time. Of course, Grandma Zhang had quarreled several times about this matter, and it was said that she had smashed the jade-inlaid clock in anger. But if Grandpa Zhang insisted on taking Miss Liu with him, what method could Grandma Zhang use to stop him? Besides, she was already almost fifty years old and had never given birth to a son or daughter. Grandpa Zhang could use this as a reason. Could Miss Liu pass on the family line for the Zhang family if she didn't see Grandpa Zhang for many years? So Grandpa Zhang really didn't put her entirely in his heart.</p>

<h3 id="e285">Basic Knowledge of Film Appreciation <a href="#e285" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c285" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">285</a></h3>
<p>— Yao Yinzhong</p>
<p>There is no doubt that film today is enthusiastically welcomed and loved by the general public, forming a universal trend; and the development of the domestic film industry is not inferior to that of foreigners, which is especially gratifying. It is only a pity that the general public's knowledge of appreciation seems to be somewhat lacking. I am now sharing my personal experience in watching movies with you, with the intention of discussing it with everyone.</p>
<p>Regardless of any film, its establishment conditions are four, namely:</p>
<p>(1) Script: The essence of film is also one of drama, it naturally needs a script like other dramas; the value of a film is very related to the quality of the script, so only a good script can have a great film; this goes without saying. The establishment conditions for a script are also two: one is the theme, and the other is the consciousness. The theme is the element that constitutes the script, and the consciousness can be said to be its skeleton. What we should pay attention to here are these two items.</p>
<p>(2) Actors: With a script, but without actors, there is no way to produce a film. And a good film also needs good actors to perform; the so-called good actors, of course, must have sufficient cultivation in film. What we should pay attention to here is whether the role played by the actor in the film is suitable, and whether the performance skills are flawless; most importantly, whether they can fully express the personality of the character.</p>
<p>(3) Director: With a script and actors, there is still a need to allocate and arrange, and to instruct the performance, which is the responsibility of the so-called "director." His position and authority in the film are also imaginable. Some people compare him to the commander-in-chief of the army, which is very appropriate. Therefore, whether a film is good or bad is closely related to him; the famous and expensive films in Europe and the United States are all created by directors with superb skills. What we should pay attention to here, of course, is his overall design skills for this film; as for skills and techniques, they should also be paid attention to at the same time.</p>
<p>(4) Photography: The script is arranged, the actors are assigned, and they have performed. After that, it is to capture them in the lens. Only when the work reaches this level is it considered complete; the so-called "photographer" works under the control of the director, and his duties include the "lighting," "subtitles," "pictures," "background," and "characters" of the film. And what we should pay attention to here is these.</p>
<p>In addition, now is the era of sound films, and attention should also be paid to its "music," "singing," and "dialogue." We must put effort into appreciating these aspects, and we must not ignore one or two points; otherwise, we cannot be considered to have done our best in appreciation. Finally, I must also tell everyone that we must recognize that film is also art, and it is also scientific art. (Thanks)</p>
<p>Film Review</p>
<h3 id="e286">Review of "Strictly Personal" <a href="#e286" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c286" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">286</a></h3>
<p>— Yan Nan</p>
<p>I have a kind of inexplicable fondness for Paramount's productions. Although I dare not say that every one of their films is good. But most of them are not bad. There are very few that fail. "Strictly Personal," although the whole film can't really find anything particularly good, at the same time, it can't be said that there is anything bad. Everything is just walking along the horizontal line.</p>
<p>The story in American films should be considered superior. There are no golden dreams here, only a very common phenomenon in society. However, if it is not a mistake by the screenwriter, then the director should be responsible. The film as a whole generally does not have anything that is unreasonable, but in the details, there are some omissions, and there is a very vague consciousness in the story, which seems to be not very coherent from beginning to end. Briefly speaking, it tells the story of an old couple who, because they had been in prison, were quite repentant after escaping, and set up a small club in a small town with a friend's daughter. Unexpectedly, a thug came and threatened to report the escape, intending to seize the club. The old couple had no choice but to agree to share the profits with him. The thug soon committed a murder case for money, and shifted the blame to the old couple. Fortunately, the evidence was not accurate, and they were released. The thug then seduced the old couple's friend's daughter, intending to go to Mexico together. At the airport, the thug was suddenly shot and killed. A young reporter who had been in love with the girl then returned home with her.</p>
<p>The instructions were translated inaccurately, and the meaning of the play lacked a center. There was too much dialogue during the performance, sometimes a lot of nonsense that did not address the topic. For example, who killed the thug was never explained clearly, and for example, the girl's father was released, and the girl took refuge in the small club. All the actors' performances were very conflicted and inhumane.</p>
<p>The court's treatment of the murder case was very light, which was actually to accommodate the ending of the whole play, and it did not hesitate to place the spirit of the law in the background. There was also a description of the American reporters' boredom, annoyance, and embarrassment, which was very incisive, making people laugh and pity.</p>
<p>To put it in fashionable terms, the dialogue is very "humorous"... Although there is not a single comedian, there are not a few jokes. The director has also done his best in terms of scene division and presentation. Photography, lighting, sound recording, location, and arrangement... According to the performance standards of American films, it is only average.</p>
<p>In terms of performance, the old woman Marjorie Rambeau is the protagonist, and her expressions are mostly superior and commendable. However, Dorothy Jordan's performance in the whole film is the best, very much like a naive girl.</p>
<h3 id="e287">Review of "Flower of Peace": A Small Company's Production Is Commendable <a href="#e287" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c287" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">287</a></h3>
<p>Since the closure of Youlian Company last winter, more than half of the actors and staff have switched to Mingxing Company. However, from 1930 to the summer of 1932, more than ten films were made in two years. But for reasons such as reorganization, they have not been publicly screened. Recently, the liquidation office of Youlian Company has started to close down, so all the films have been cleared out in order to clear the principal and interest of each shareholder. "Flower of Peace" is the first of those films in storage.</p>
<p>Youlian produced "Yu Meiren" in the winter of 1930, which was also the first sound film made in China. Later, it used Erde's great book "Wild River Heroine" as a selling point. But this "Flower of Peace," half sound and half martial arts (?), actually changed to a new style, and the story is also extremely novel. There are many allusions in it. For example, Peace Valley clearly represents China, Jinyue represents a certain warlord; Gu Guosi refers to the Chinese people; Fu Li is said to be Puyi... People who have seen this film will definitely be very clear.</p>
<p>The outline of the story: Peace Valley was unfortunately occupied by the strong neighbor Jinyue. One of the villagers, Gu Guosi, plotted resistance but failed. The daughter of the old village chief, who was studying abroad, later returned to the valley, and the village chief had been killed. So she contacted her comrades and vowed to avenge her father. The villagers pushed Gu Guosi as the leader, responding from the inside and outside, killing Jinyue and driving out all the bandits, and Hanmin, the general who defected from Jinyue's command, and the daughter of the old village chief became a loving couple.</p>
<p>It is easy to see the director's skills during the performance. The scene division, etc., are all impeccable. There is also considerable success in photography. The lighting is still mostly exterior, so it is completely using sunlight. There are only two small segments in which the characters are too dark because the focal point of the lens is not suitable. There are very few omissions and gaps. It is rare for a production of a small company to be like this.</p>
<p>A scene from the Wufa Gaomeng co-production "Peach Blossom Village," Jacques Hollander and Sunny Hale are courting Zerlene Harville, which is a musical and singing film with nature as the background, scheduled to be released at the Nanjing Grand Theater on Wednesday of this week.</p>
<p>A big regret is that the director raided the old tricks of martial arts films, which backfired. The insertion of large segments of chaotic fighting is really like children fighting. Thirty or forty villagers and twenty or thirty bandit gangs, the so-called large force, are just that, which is too childish. The sword fighting is the same as the full martial arts on the stage, specializing in falling, which is a pity.</p>
<p>The overall performance is mediocre. Bao Gusong is slightly better, and Ye Juanjuan's few scenes are also moving. Xu Qinfang's martial arts are very good, but her expression is naive. Below Zi Kui, it is even less worth mentioning.</p>
<p>This film is produced by a small Chinese company, so I would like to introduce it to everyone to see.</p>
<h3 id="e288">"Peach Blossom Village" Worth Introducing <a href="#e288" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c288" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">288</a></h3>
<p>— Xin Fu</p>
<p>Premiering this Wednesday in Nanjing</p>
<p>The De-Ying Film Company's joint production, "Spring River in the Flower Moon Night," has already caused a sensation among Chinese and foreign film fans in Shanghai. Now, this long-awaited film, "Peach Blossom Village" (Happy Ever After), jointly produced by Wufa and Gaumont, will premiere this Wednesday at the Nanjing Grand Theater. This is the latest work of Ulrich Promayr, the film production giant of Wufa. The films he produces always have something special. This "Peach Blossom Village" is certainly no exception.</p>
<p>It is a film depicting a segment of petty-bourgeois life. Its structure is completely different from "Spring River in the Flower Moon Night." Because "Spring River in the Flower Moon Night" only introduces to the screen pleasing songs, melodious music, lighthearted humor, and soft, beautiful scenery; while "Peach Blossom Village," in addition to possessing the above conditions, has achieved extraordinary success in the progress of the story and the vividness of the performances.</p>
<p>Lilian Harvey, who gained fame from "Dragon Soaring Phoenix Dancing" and was hired by the United States for a large sum, plays a homeless village girl in this film. The London New Century Newspaper said that her performance has never been as moving as in this "Peach Blossom Village." Jack Hulbert and Sonny Hale play a couple of silly young men here. One was the protagonist of "Happy Marriage," which premiered at Carlton last year; the other has already met us in "Spring River in the Flower Moon Night," and various newspapers have said that he is the one with the best expressions. These three stars gathered together. How good the result will be, we can already imagine.</p>
<h3 id="e289">Movie Novel Secrets (10) <a href="#e289" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c289" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">289</a></h3>
<p>— Cairo</p>
<p>John's hot tears were already streaming down, and he said, "This really makes me ashamed to the extreme, with no place to hide. But what about the future? My reputation is lost, I am rejected by society, and although you forgive me, my children will also despise their father."</p>
<p>"John, John," Mary's voice was again full of the spirit of encouraging progress, "Stand up, muster your courage, and restore your usual spirit! When we had no hope before, we were still able to fight to the end and win. The war ahead of us will be even more difficult than what we have experienced before. But if the two of us can work together and strive forward, victory will still belong to us!"</p>
<p>"Work together! Work together!" John repeated. From then on, the two of them worked together to strive forward. Year after year, until his reputation was restored and he saw the light of day again. John's reputation was even greater than before. John had been a senator for several years. However, for several years, because John was diligent in public affairs from morning till night, the affection between the couple became estranged. John knew that Mary had long harbored fear and pain in her heart, so he decided not to continue as a senator, willing to use the remaining years of his life to make up for the loss of his beloved wife.</p>
<p>But now there are obstacles and enemies in front of them. These obstacles and enemies are none other than their own children. They rely on the results of their parents' lifelong struggle, enjoying comfort. When their parents are old, they still do not allow them to retire because of their selfish and self-serving hearts. Therefore, when John announced his intention not to continue as a senator, a group of children quarreled, protested, and opposed John's withdrawal from politics. Seeing this, John was very angry and said, "You really annoy us!"</p>
<p>A group of children looked at each other, feeling very surprised. Mary hurriedly explained to her children, "Children, don't misunderstand your father's meaning. How can we bear to part with you, having been together with you day and night for decades? But we have used half of our lives' souls on you, and now that you are all grown up and can be independent, we cannot not take back our souls." "Mother," the eldest son William said, "I simply don't understand what you're saying."</p>
<p>"You won't understand. We have our secrets." John answered for Mary.</p>
<p>"Secrets?" the second son, Robert, said in great surprise. "Do you have any secrets from us too?"</p>
<p>"That's right, Robert," Mary explained to him. "We have our secrets, you won't know them. Perhaps there is a kind of secret between husband and wife that others cannot understand. Your father and I certainly also have our own secrets. Secret joys, secret worries, lovely secrets, painful secrets. Only your father and I can share them together." "Come," John said to Mary. The two of them then took hands and entered their bedroom. Outside, the children were still shouting and arguing. But John and Mary had already secretly prepared, slipped out through a secret door, and took a car to a secret place. (The End)</p>
