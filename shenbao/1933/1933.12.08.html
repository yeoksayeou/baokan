<h3>蒙古自治解决舒</h3>
<p>内蒙古自治問題經蒙人之請求。中央之考慮與調查。輾轉數月。現已决定自治之大綱。規定自治區政府之權限。確立自治經費之來源各自治區之關係。亦皆明白釐訂。今後但須内蒙各盟旗如何實行。中央政府如何領導其實行。即可以漸收自治之效。而邊陲之鞏固。民族隔膜之化除。亦將於此中見之。夫内蒙古區域。原有六盟二十四部。四十九旗。近以九一八事變後。龍江不守。遼吉淪没。熱河失陷。遂使東四盟中之哲里木盟。卓索圖盟。昭烏達盟。等淪爲異域。現在屬於我國者。僅錫林郭勒盟一盟。惟錫盟在東四盟中地方較廣。形勢。重要。德王即爲錫盟之副盟長。在内蒙王公中爲後起之秀將來有望之人才。西二盟區域。亦漸見開發。正在由牧畜經濟轉化至於農業經濟之過程中。值此世界經濟恐慌未已。一般政治尚在變換期間。内蒙東接日本。北隣外蒙。雙方影響。匪特足令内蒙地方應付困難。且將及於華北整個之邊防。倘措施失當。頗易演成較今日更嚴重之現象也。</p>
<p>蓋隣國窺我邊境者巳非一朝一夕矣。西比利亞大鐵道成功日俄戰爭前後。我國即處於被動地位。當此時也。清政府無能。致任人分劇。自己毫無自衛之能力。民國以來。此種情勢。亦無多大改善。外蒙離貳。即其顯著之例證。惟其如此。更啓强隣之野心。我國應付。乃愈困難。近來新疆内部糾紛。纏擾不清。回漢關係。亦不易求得適當解决。至於西藏。對外關係。亦不單純。前途之危險。或較新疆更甚。現蒙回藏三民族。對於中央政府。尚有内向之心及時挽救猶未晚也。内蒙自治。旣己開端。祇須中央指導得宜　。察綏兩省。又能誠懇相助。則今後之内蒙。必漸次與漢人發生良好親切之觀感。久而久之。融合爲一。即不再有民族之界限矣。不過在自治施行之初。歷史上因習尚未盡除以前吾人切願當局。特别是察綏地方政治負責者。注意努力於經濟與政治上建設。同時尤不可忽視内蒙地方之特殊性。此種特殊性質。如能加以適切之領導。則强隣雖惡。亦必無從施其毒計。邊疆藩籬。亦因此而得鞏固之基礎焉。</p>
<p>内蒙區域内之特殊性質爲何。分别言之。殊嫌繁冗。綜合歸納。約得以下三端。内蒙爲地理及氣候所限。遊牧乃最相宜。故期一般經濟。乃屬於牧畜經濟。此爲世所共知。惟人類歷史。時時演進。雖進行有緩急。步履有快慢但絶無永久停滯。一成不變者。蒙古因交通不便。進步較遲固有之。但現亦正向農業經濟猛進。其趨勢異常明顧。在此轉換時期。上層之政治關係。亦將感受同樣影響。建立新軌範。開闢未來途徑。即在此時。此指導内蒙自治不可不注意者一。</p>
<p>也。内蒙因經濟較農業社會落後之故。一般文化教育。幾等於零。其對於漢人殊多隔閡。或則全無理解。或則一味蠻横。欲與之同抗强敵。共衛邊疆。其何可得。是以對牧畜。應先設法令其改進。使適合於近代之需求然後從而教育之則樸厚之蒙民。不難於數年間成爲精練之國民。則一般文化之溝通。與啓發</p>
<p>教育之實施。實爲當前之急務。此指導内蒙自治不可不注意者二也。宗教因習。尤須加以嚴切之注意。一面固應啓發蒙人知識。逐漸輸入科學思想。一面亦不宜抺殺其過去歷史因緣。於遊牧人之日常生活。尤須多方考察。徐圖改進。此指導内蒙自治不可不注意者三也。</p>

<p>（倫敦）　張學良現定十五日在意國白林的西、乘康脫威特輪船返國、目下已離倫敦、在赴羅馬途中、擬在羅馬小住數日、再赴白林的西、據接近張氏者言、渠一俟返國、卽將與國民政府中人、晤商一切、又張工在此間啓程前曾告知友云、渠意欲調和各方意見、以期終止内戰、統一國家、聞張氏曾電南京、聲明願歸國贊助政府、但若欲其參加内戰、則寗留海外、（七日國民電）</p>
<h3>出亡猶太民族俄表示願收容　東部西比利亞建自治新邦</h3>
<p>（莫斯科）　蘇聯副主席杜史密維志今日聲稱、德國猶太人之出亡於外而欲得新住處者、蘇俄可容納之、而請其參加建立自治的猶太共和國名畢羅畢强者之工作、此新邦將置於西比利亞之東部、與滿洲毘連、俟有三萬猶太人居住該處、新國即行成立、其土地共爲一千萬英畝、係恨據一九二八年蘇俄猶太人欲建立猶太共和國者之恊定而指撥者云、（七日路透電）</p>
<h3>意相雄心勃勃倡國聯改造運動　傾向締結七强約控制世界　企圖由理想主義轉爲現實　但竭力避免作單獨行動</h3>
<p>羅馬　汎繫黨大會、雖於前日决定意大利對於國聯會之態度、主張根本改造國聯會、但消息靈通方面、則以爲此項决議、並未規定意國將首先提出改造國聯會之計畫、並謂汎繫黨大會每年開會四五次、以决定意國政策之理論綱領、至於此種理論綱領成爲實際行動、則由政府任之、且汎繫黨大會此項决議、勢必引起各方面之爭辯、並須作輿論方面之凖備、旣有此種凖備後、方可提出改造國聯會之計畫、至於在汎繫黨大會作此項决議以前、對於改造國聯會一事、並未有何種外交談話云、（七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>羅馬　據此間消息靈過方面稱、意大利並無意作改組國聯會之主動者、日昨發表之公佈、僅係希望列强能用外交方式向國聯提議改組、感在國聯行政院開會時提出之、此間官方正式否認法西斯黨大會將起草改組國聯計畫之傳說、（六日路透電）</p>
<p>羅馬　頃從可靠方面聞悉、英法已保證贊助意國之大舉改組國際聯合會、意相墨索里尼雖仍傾向於締結七强公約、以控制世界和平、但在目前、苟能完成五强公約、拘束西歐諸國、於願巳足、至意大利所欲提議之改組國聯計劃、逆料將爲基本改革、大事删除原發起人威爾遜總統所灌輸之理想主義、因墨氏爲過渡現實主義派、未必能大信任威爾遜之理想主義也、惟墨氏亦非確信意國所要求留居國聯之代價、可以完全辦到、故巳考量退出國聯之結果、以爲如不獲巳、甚致成爲孤立、非所惜、因旣有德俄日美等居國聯之外、意國即成爲孤立、亦未必長久、况在國聯之外亦大有合縱締交之機會、尤其在近東一帶、因俄土俱歡迎意國爲控制地中海東部之與援者也、（六日國民電）</p>
<h3>英國密切注意　祗能視爲意輿情傾向　目前不欲加以考慮</h3>
<p>（倫敦）　昨晚汎繫黨太會决議意大利仍爲國聯會會員、但以最短期内根本改造國聯會爲條件、此間官塲宣稱、汎繫黨大會雖有此種决定、但意大利政府一日不以正式公文通知國聯會、則英國政府即一日不予以考慮、在正式通知國聯會以前、此種决定只視爲黨之傾向與願望、純爲意大利内部問題而已（六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）　法西斯大會所通過關於國聯改組之决議案、雖引起倫敦人士甚大之注意、但覺其實際並未變動局勢、蓋此不過證實意國輿情之傾向耳、英官塲對此問題未發評論、惟擁護國聯之各方面皆謂國聯盟約稍加修改、爲功必緩、糾紛必多云、（六日路透電）</p>
<h3>法持觀望態度</h3>
<p>（巴黎）　巴黎負責任之各面宣稱、國聯盟約如加修改、須需諸會員國之一致同意、法國必俟各方一致贊成改革該團體、而後始能贊同云、（六日路透電）</p>
<h3>柏林熱烈贊助　認爲趨向修正和約初步</h3>
<p>（倫敦）　柏林晚報熱切贊助彼等所謂墨索里尼之哀的美敦書、稱此爲趨向凡爾賽和約修正之第一步驟、柏林半官界謂國聯恒無事可爲、不過係戰勝者之俱樂部耳、意國巳擔負艱難而不爲人所感謝之工作、作實行果敢眞實的程序之嘗試云、（六日路透電）</p>
<h3>愛文諾將赴倫敦刺探英方意見</h3>
<p>（日内瓦）　國聯秘書長愛文諾定星期日來倫敦、因意國之建議、此行益爲人所注意、衆料愛文諾將乘此機會、探刺英當軸對意國最近發展之意見、（六日路透電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）　意大利汎繫黨大會、經墨索里尼本人提出報告、要求改造國聯會、國聯會當局、聞之未嘗不表示驚異、因據可靠消息、最近國聯會秘書長愛文諾氏赴羅馬時、意相墨索里尼、絶未表示其眞正計畫、墨索里尼並曾對若干政府、明白宣言、意大利無退出國聯會之意、各該政府今日突聞汎繫黨之决定、頗以爲異、歐洲外交界對於此事之第一觀念、以爲墨索里尼係四强條約之發起人、嗣見此約行將失敗、乃以種種方法救護之、其所用之策略、係使四强條約擺脫其在商訂之際所感受之影響、換言之、即該約與國聯會之密切關係、意大利原未考慮及之、旋因他國要求、乃將此層加入、厥後務欲有以解除之、意大利從事此種行動、已數月於兹、此次汎繫黨大會之决定、即爲此種策略之發展、墨索里尼對國聯會中各會員國、在法理上平等一層、極所反對、此爲人所共和之事、墨氏改造計畫、其主要之點、或在解除此種拘策、即廢止日内瓦中立性之合議機關、而以若干大國合組之統制機關、并加入蘇俄以替代之、據羅馬發表之公報、國聯會之組織運用及目標、均在修改之列、意大利政府對於汎繫黨决議之案、如付諸實行、則由今日起、即將有所行動、明年一月國聯會行政院集會時意大利或將向其提出具體改革案、第此種改革案範圍廣大、想羅馬方面亦不致以爲短時間以内、即可達到目的也、（六日哈瓦斯電電）</p>
<h3>日冷眼待推移</h3>
<p>（東京）　意大利政府改組國聯之問題、外務省未接詳細報告、外務省某人語其意見、謂德國退出國聯後、歐洲政局瀕於危機、且國聯對此無能力、因此意大利遂提起國聯之改組案、從前國聯討論中日問題而致日本之退出、此巳證實國聯爲不連於現實之機關、意大利從來不滿於英法兩國獨占國聯、故今次改組計劃、實有認眞之態度、國聯之改組實爲困難問題、但因意大利態度强硬、似有退出國聯之勢、故不能輕視此案、如意大利退出國聯、則國聯完全潰滅、日本今後靜觀歐洲各國如何解决此問題云云、（七日聯電電）</p>
<h3>美輿論抱懷疑</h3>
<p>（紐約）　美國各報評論意大利汎繫黨大會决定改造國聯會一事、大多承認國聯會本身有種種缺陷、但改造國聯會之計劃、在短時期内能否實現、則殊爲懷疑、「紐約泰晤士報」即抱此態度、至於「紐約名聲講壇報」則謂如欲實施改造國聯會之計畫、而不至引起與國聯會各會員國體面有關之全盤問題、則殊屬難能云、（七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>英報認爲國聯壽終先聲</h3>
<p>（倫敦）　意國對國聯所發之哀的美敦書、此間皆視爲歷史上重大之舉、各報多視意國要求、爲國聯壽終之先聲、獨泰唔士報以爲國聯根基鞏固、毫無所畏、而施以建設性的改革、亦屬急要之圖云、每日電聞謂英政府深知財政改革之需要、如該問題能引勸任何解决、則自可以和解之精神解决之、該報又謂英相麥唐納無論如何、必使英國佔關於國聯談判居間人之地位、此項談判將於國聯秘書長愛文諾來游倫敦時開始云、政界則頗信意國或將乘明年一月間國聯會議之機、提出偉大之改革决議案、（七日國民電）</p>
<h3>法報不啻成爲五强内閣</h3>
<p>（巴黎）　巴黎時報切實指陳意國建議之重大、謂實無異圖在國聯機構之上組成一主要列强之「五執政内閣」（法國革命時代五執政者所成行政部之名稱）云、（六日路透電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）　巴黎廻聲報批評法西斯大會之决議案、謂寗願無國聯而不願有聯合意德帝國主義之國聯、倫敦同謀可認爲確實、但巴黎有最後發言權、法國僅可擁護國聯盟約第十條所規定各國土地完整之根本條文云、（七日路透電）</p>
<h3>奥報謂將引起歐洲新紛爭</h3>
<p>維也納　「聯邦郵報」對於意大利汎繫黨大會提議改造國聯會之計畫、加以祝賀、謂此種計畫、或可爲維持和平最重要之因素云、但「新自由報」則以爲此項提議、將成爲歐洲列强間所紛爭之一新問題云、（七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>捷克報反對限制小國權利</h3>
<p>捷京　捷克各報一致以爲意大利改造國聯會之計畫、倘僅限於使國聯會程序化爲簡易、則可加以接受、但對於限制小國權利、及使國聯會公約與凡爾賽條約隔離、則均表示竭力反對、例如「捷克斯拉夫報」謂國聯會公約與凡爾賽條約、二者不可分離、如取銷其一、必毁滅其他、苟如此、則國聯會必將成爲修改和約之工具云、（七日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>自由談計口授田  曹聚仁　　近曰蘭北輿論，很多評論「計口授田」的　度。「計口授田」，只能說是一種古制，並算不得土地革命，我以爲。　　晉武帝平吳以後，施行户調法：「男子一人占田七十畝：女子三十畝。其外，丁男課五十畝，丁女二十畝，次丁男半之，女則不課。」這是第一次計口授田。北魏太祖初入中原，分徙吏民以充京都，各給耕牛，計口授田。孝文帝太和九年，下詔頒給民田：「諸男夫，十五以上，受露田四十畝，婦人二十畝；奴婢依良丁。諸民年及課則受田，老·免及身没則還田。諸桑田不在還授之限。」這是第二次計口授田。北齋河清三年令：「一夫受露田八十畝，婦四十畝，奴隸依良人。率以十八授田，六十六退田。又丁男一人，給永業田二十畝，爲桑田，不在逺授之限。」這是第三次計口授田。隨文帝開皇十三年，發使四出，均天下之田，其狹鄉，每丁二十畝。這是第四次計口授田。唐武德七年，行授田之制，「丁及男十八以上者，人一頃；其八十畝爲口分，二十畝爲永業田。」這是第五次計口授田。計口授田之制，自唐元宗天寳亂後全廢：其遺法行於大家庭間，迄今猶有存者。　　古代實行這個制度，其利弊何如？唐代以後，何以非廢棄不可？南北大族，如唐代張氏，宋元明間鄭氏，他們何以能支持數百年？這些史蹟，並不見專家精密研究，用以和現况相對比；而批評的人，也不曾溯源窮委，或贊成或反對，都只「憑臆武斷，不切實際」。現在號稱科學時代，種花，養蜂…等等，無論選種，培植，都要經過幾番精密的試騐，然後見諸實行；南京還有一條試騐的馬路，當作建築馬路的藍本。則此種關係全國人民利害的大問題，豈有不經試騐而可以貿然實行的嗎？　　「耕者有其田」，我聞其語，未見其制。中國土地制度，總要有根本的辦法，「計口授田」是不是一種適當的制度？到值得我們用研究的態度去觀察牠的。清談  陳梁　　明季政治窳敗，朝綱不振，民間所受之痛苦無窮，民間之憤慨也達於極點，此讀史者類能言之。不但民間如此，就是比較情明的在朝人，也往往是牢騷滿腹，痛駡不休。這一些文字，只要我們有工夫去翻檢，在明季諸作家著作中，隨時都可以找到。　　以前，讀明末殉難大臣吳麟徵的家書，裏面就有說不盡的牢騷，雖身居顯職，而什麽時候都想離去他所謂「豺狼當道」的地方。在「寄禀伯兄秋圃」信裏，他很憤慨的說「…舉朝終事蒙蔽，大臣」無骨力，小臣無肝膽，以致太阿之柄倒持，此何能以口舌爭！」在這樣的時代，决不是以「清淡」以「口舌爭」能解决的，我覺得他的這一理解是很對的。　　當時的民間情形怎樣呢？侯若樸在尺牘裏說，「以時事觀之，如加派，如募兵，如調兵，如榷當舖，如議蘆洲，種種咨部足餉之法，皆弊政也。」僅就這幾句話看，也可以想見當時的苛捐雜稅是如何的加多，派兵拉夫的事如何的普遍，如何的想盡了方法來搜刮民間的錢財，使人民欲生不能，欲死不得。可是民間也似乎知道這一切並不是以「口舌爭」能解决的，所以在同一信裏，就有「民心慚漓，時有輕生犯上之舉。」這眞是「民不畏死，奈何以死懼之」；而「不畏死」實際上，是更欲求「生。」　　類此的當然狠多，如侯方域，楊繼聖，宗臣諸人攻擊當時政治窳敗的文字，是早已爲讀者所熟習了。這裏，只想介紹湯顯祖答馬心易信裏的幾句話，所謂「此時男子多化爲婦人，側行俛立，好語巧笑，乃得立於時；不然，則如海母目蝦，隨人淨沉，都亡眉目，方稱聖德」。作者心中的悲憤，可謂至此而極。這些文字，在時間上雖屬於明代，實在是萬古常新的，如這信的結尾所說，「想自古如斯，非今獨撫膺矣。」走筆至此，想及「身邊瑣事」，不禁有「天下烏鴉」之感，作此「清談。」觀海京伯馬戲叢感  葉永蓁　　三獅，虎。與人。　　全塲的人都似乎緊張起來了。　　馬戲班内的人大家在忙碌着，把那结鐵栅門都揹了來，在塲内搭成一個鐵籠我看着戲單上的節目。　　知道是獅虎來表演了，用嚴肅的神情等着看。　　果然有近十隻獅子都出來了，以後又來了四隻虎，在塲裏面漫步着。　　一個訓練的人站在中央。　　獅子和虎都按照自己的座位坐定。　　會那麽馴服的，我簡直不相信，只要訓練的人手裏的鞭一動，這些獅，這些虎，都照那訓練的人的意思做，也彷彿忙忙碌碌地。　　站在跳板上跳着的有之；相互在疊羅漢的也有之，給那訓練的人騎着的也有之。　　於是，我更加不相信。　　偶而牠們吼了一聲，或嘯了一聲，全塲的人都像有些受驚了的模樣。獅子與虎之威，在人們傳說的概念裏，是以爲非常凶猛的野獸啊。　　難道說，會眞的這麽馴服嗎？　　我替這訓練的人非常地在担心。　　然而使我不相信的還不止此，在有一種表演的時候，這訓練的人竟把自己的頭送給一隻獅口裏去，那獅子的口儘在張着，任這訓練的人將牠的上顎和下顎這樣那樣的扳。　　我爲這訓練的人心寒了一下。而全塲的人也嘆了一口氣。——這嘆氣到底是說這訓練的人胆大，或是說這獅子懦弱，我可不知道，但我，也確實嘆了一口氣。　　我並不想這獅子吃掉了那訓練的人，我却想到了黄仲則的一句詩：「似張虎威實媚人，」——現在，是比虎更凶的獅子也在媚人了！　　自古至今的人們如此；自古至今被人訓練出的野獸也都如此！　　這還有什麽話說呢？　　人們自己總算尊敬吧？　　但也仍可以說幾句話的，依我想。　　人們到現在這時候，不但在獸與人之間有了分别，即人與人之間，也有了分别。而且獸與人之間或可没有分别，而人與人之間却不可没有分别。　　就以這訓練的人而說，實在不是這些獅子，這些虎在媚他，而是他要訓練道些獅子，這些虎在媚他以求取媚於他同類的人啊，而在人羣之中呢，也可作如是觀，不是也有許多人在訓練旁的人在媚他自己，而後他自己以這訓練之術求媚於他更尊敬的人嗎？　　於是，在這之間，他不僅以鞭子鞭韃他的問類如像訓練野獸那樣，甚至於還可用其他的更殘忍的方法，更凶惡的威權來對待自己的同類。　　「你屈服嗎？」那訓練的人說。　　對方起來的是反抗。　　「好罷，讓你再來！」　　訓練的人睜着眼，拿起他那調練的武器。　　最後，待你死心踏地的屈服了，他好可以爬在你的頭上在旁的人們面前表現着。　　他是慢慢地高貴起來了，而你呢？　　你就是這馬戲班裏的獅子和虎一樣的人。　　不用笑這獅子和虎，我祈求你們。人，自己。客窗小記  殊　　十一　　在陳仁錫（明卿）的「明文奇賞」裏，看到唐順之答王遵巖的一封信，牢騷滿腹，駡盡當時文士。書甚長，文字正是林語堂所謂「語錄體。」其最憤慨的一節：　常以刻文字爲無慶恥之一節。若使吾身後有兩人作此業障·則非吾收知。至於自家子弟，則須有遺囑，說破此意，不欲其作此業障也。僕居閒偶想起宇宙間有一二事，人人見慣，而絶是可笑者：其屠沽細人，有一碗飯吃，其死後則必有一　慕誌：其達官貴人與中科第人，稍有名目在世間者，其死後則必有一部詩文刻集，如生而飯食，死而棺槨之不可缺。……幸而所謂墓誌與詩文集者，皆不久泯滅；然其往者滅矣，而在者尚滿屋也。若皆存在世痱，即使以大地爲架子，亦安頓不下矣。此等文字，倘家藏人蓄者，盡舉祖龍手段作用一番，則南山煤炭竹木嘗盡减價矣。可笑，可笑！　　陳明卿評此文云：「一味透脫，不求雅馴」，在一般正人君子看來，這封信確實有些「不雅馴」，然而，就在這「不雅訓」之中，使我們看到了庸順之比當時其他作家高明處。陳明卿的小品，在明伐可算是重要的，可是，這一部「明文奇賞」，選得不僅蕪雜，而且大多是「應酬文章」，實在使人讀不到「奇」的印象。兩兄弟（五二）  莫泊桑著李維克譯　　「這畫像現在歸你了，我的小哲安，因爲你是他的遺產繼承人呀。我們將來要把它拿到你」的新房子裏去。」　　大家離開飯廳走進客廳裏有去坐時，她便把那小肖像放在客廳的壁爐上，靠近時鐘放着，回復了它以　的位置。　　羅蘭裝着他的烟斗，筆爾和哲安各人燃着一根紙烟。他們兩兄弟抽烟的時候，通常是一個在房子裏來回走着，一個則埋在一舉安樂椅　交义着兩腿。父親却老是以騎馬的姿勢坐在一把椅子上，並且把痰逺逺地向壁爐　吐去。　　羅蘭媽媽坐在一把矮椅上，靠近一張放着亮的小桌子繡着花，幟着東西或是在襯衣被單之類上面縫着記號。　　她今晚開始做一塊刺花的東西，預備將來放在哲安房裏的。這是一件艱難而又複雜的工作，起首非以全副精神應付不行。可是她的眼睛雖在數着針數，却仍時時抬起來，向那靠着時鐘放着的死人的畫像迅捷地窺看一下。而那兩手擱在背後，嘴裏啣着紙烟，以四五個脚步穿過那仄狹的客廳，來回走着的醫生，每次都過着他母親的眼光。　　那情形就像彼此窺伺着，兩人裏面己經發生了什麽鬥爭似的；筆爾心裡感着異非不快，一種難於忽受的不快，彷彿在使得他的心瘞擎着似的。但他雖是痛苦。却又滿足，他心想：「假使她知道我猜着了，她這時該痛苦啦！」於是每次走到壁爐面前，他便停立一下子，瞧着那長着金髮的瑪賴沙的面孔，表示他有個固定的思想時時浮在腦中。而這比一個展開的手掌還小的小畫像，好像一個險惡的，可怕的，活的人一樣，突然進了這房子和這家庭。　　裝在街口的門鈴忽然響了。那樣寗靜的羅蘭媽媽竟嚇得一跳，這在醫生眼中，顯然表示了她的神經不安。　　隨後她說道：「這定是陸醉米太太」。而她那憂懼的眼睛又抬起來望了壁爐一下。　　筆爾懂得了，也可以說是他自以爲懂得了她那恐懼和痛苦的原因。女人的眼光是最厲害的，她們的神智敏捷，思想多疑。當這快要進來的女人看到了這曾没有過的小畫像時，也許第一眼她便會發見這畫像的面孔和哲安的面孔相似。於是她便會知道並明白一切！他恐懼起來了，他感着一種害怕這宗醜事被人發覺的，突如其來的可憎的恐懼，於是他回轉身，當門開的時候，把郡小畫像塞在時鐘底下，不曾讓他的父親和弟弟看見。　　他重遇着他母親的眼睛時，他覺得她的眼睛變了，現得昏昧和兇猛。　　「晚安」，陸醇米太太說，「我來陪你們喝一杯茶啦」。　　可是當大家圍着她，紛紛問好的時候，筆爾從那没有關上的門口消失了。道：　　「多麽粗暴的東西」！　　羅蘭夫人回答道：　　「不要生氣他罷，他今天身體有點不舒服，並且在特洛威爾頑得倦了呢」。</p>

<p>春秋說家  花鈴　　這個「家」字，在從前，好像只有與女子發生關係的事情，才用得到。如討老婆，曰「宜爾室家」，此外最普遍的，是「」渾家，是「周瑞家的」，「王小二家的」。　　但這個「家」，如今也跟着女子的金蓮，大腿，乳峯，一同解放了，解放到了不拘在甚麽下面，都可　上一個「家」的程度。　　掌一國或一部之綱紀的，爲「政治家」。會得折衝樽爼，爲國爭光者，爲「外交家」。善於治理財政，使國富民裕的，爲「理財家」。能保障人權，主持公道的，爲「法學家」。得天下英才而教育之，或自奉束修以上，未嘗無詢也的，爲「教育家」。悲天憫人，爲懷胞予，斥私財而施衣施粥，施藥施棺的，爲「慈善家」。會跑，會跳，會玩球，會游泳，會打太極拳的，爲「體育家」，會寫對，會繪畫，會刻圖章，會塑人像，會攝影，會玩樂器的，爲「藝術家」。研究生物的，爲「生物學家」。研究醫學的，爲「醫學家」。不拘精於怎一藝的，都可稱爲甚麽家。所以有人說，「四海爲家」，「到處爲家」，或許就是一個請讖。　　不過從這上面看，雖然「家」之爲用，可謂大矣，但是有些貴族化。據我的意思，這個「家」字，還該努力使之平民化，普遍到一般有專門藝技的平民。倒如愛抽大烟的，該稱「吸烟家」。愛喝酒的，該稱「喝酒家」。愛打架的，該稱「」打架家。愛相駡的，該稱「淘氣家」。强盜，可稱「刦掠家」。賊，可稱「偷竊家」。飽食終日，無所事事的，呌做「吃飯家」。肉檢肥的抓，事檢輕的幹的，呌做「懶惰家」。揮霍無度的，呌做「揮霍家」。呼盧喝雉的，呌做「賭博家」。花言巧語的，可名「說謊家」。不講理性的，呌做「蠻横家」。怕老婆的，名正言順，尊爲「懼　　内家」。　　把「家」這麽的一推廣，那何愁不每人都「自成一家」。若是在此情形之下，而猶不成其爲「家」，那無疑地是一個廢物了。牢獄中的播音  清癯　　前天，碰見一個新從牢獄裏，釋出來的朋友們：他吃官司，並不是犯了什麽罪大惡極的事？不過新近吃上了阿芙蓉癮癖：於是他到内地就在燕子窩裏，被一般警士們看相了；有一天，他正在吞雲吐霧的當兒，竟在一榻横陳的拉將起來，捉到官裏去了！他有一特性，公安局要請教癮君子光臨，原在罰欵上做此開銷；那末，至多罰了二三十元也可以過門，不消幾分鐘遂可出來，呌「捉自由他捉，烟還自我吹，」也不算什麽一回事？他到了這時偏想出巧妙來，以爲我要一願戒絶這種嗜好，免得受累，且可省些費用：所以情願關起來，不願罰金；那局長也無辦法，只得移司法，呌縣政府裏承審員去判决了！　　他從此進了監獄，做了現行犯，嘗了鐵窗中的風味；但他判處三個月的有期徒刑，轉瞬就可以釋放，到出獄的那一天，其時在下午，他還到浴堂裏淴了一個浴，然後到茶館裏又泡了一壺茶：高談闊論的把這獄中的生活狀况，和種種内幕，說了許多親歷的眞相；使人眞聽得比聽了一回好書，還要有趣味；他說我在監獄裏，和在外面要自由得多，因爲你要什麽？就有什麽？中問你要賭，那末，摇寳，麻雀，撲克，也可分個輸贏，你要吃，那末，早晨頭腐漿油炙檜，生洋肉，粢飯團，也可吃個一飽，有時因爲捉進去的九流三教無一不有，所以也可以聽得著徽調，和花鼓戲一類；有時在庭心水門汀上練些武藝，打套拳頭，因爲江湖上一流人也在裏面他狠願意傳授人們；所以他雖判三個月的獄中生涯，他實在狠自由地的過去了！他說我在監獄中，僅在夜間看了三次月圓，己經拘禁的期限滿了！　　有事，他是很失望的，他起初不願罰金，情願入監獄中去度三個月的光隂；第一要想相戒了嗜好，到也狠好的機會；不料外面硬不起頭皮。要去過癮，咦！裏頭你就是不想吸，也會有人要來勸你的，到這時不由得又心上難過了，眼淚鼻涕一時忍不往了，那末，怎樣呌我不依然吹一個爽快呢！所以現在的烟量比以前增加，反不能斷絶了；吾本來有一個老母，當那捉到公安局裏去的時候，不禁聽了老淚縱横，不勝可憐，有人說你老人家，現在不必姑息了，待吾吃了一番苦，從此戒斷烟癮，也未嘗不是你將來的福：唉！豈料没有什種好結果，吾對母親說，兒以前受的毒是黑的，現在受的毒是紅的，黑的還可以戒，紅的就是到死不可以戒的；我聰他從頭至尾的，述了這經歷監獄中三個月的况味，竟有這樣的意外，記出來想春秋裏也未曾有過的一　資料吧！交情  恰恰館主　　人是富有感情的動物，所以不論交情則已，要論交情，則往往十八代祖宗以上都會扯開去。譬如說：你的曾祖和咱的曾祖，從前是「同年」的。你的祖父和咱的祖父，從前是「同寅」的。你的父親和咱的父親，從前是「拜把弟兄。」你想咱們的世代的交情多好？好要是你當今是做着啥啥委員，外加兼上啥啥部長。或是做了某省的主席，或者某省的啥啥廳長的話。自然囉，咱要請你放個「差事」，弄個「局長」或「縣長」當當，還不容易嗎？「資格」儘可没有，只要能夠夠面譬如所說的世代的交情，和你討論一下便得了。否則，就是同姓不同宗的，也非得和你認起咱們是「一家兒」不可。因爲不是這樣，咱和你没有淵源可說，你和咱没有什麽關係。那麽，還是乖乖的「識相點」，免開尊口，不要自討没趣！　　唉！本來人是富有感情的動物啊，不要說，要有父子；兄弟；夫婦；朋友；的關係，纔夠得上感情。就是膜不相關的，只要凡是同屬人類，也應該有一種「同情心」來互助生存！不然，與禽獸何異呢？　　雖然，你瞧；世界上儘有種人，在微賤的時候，和你固然是親戚；朋友；交情很深。照理，他一旦飛黄騰達了，你要有所圖謀，閒話一句，總可帮忙。然而不然，這時他凖會仰着腦袋，把眼珠子向着青天說：「位咱和你旣非同鄉，又非親友，更没有世代的交情……」那麽，請問怎辦？難道你駡他「與禽獸何異，」他便會扯出十八代祖宗以上的交情來和你理論嗎？　　徐碧波小小聲明　近屢經友輩見詢。鄙人在某小報大論國事。頗訝。講而讀之。果見署名者。完全與賤名相同。而理論精審。見解透闢。迴非落伍如余者。所能望其項背。是以不敢掠美。聲明如上。兼告友好之注意者。短篇小說我的羅曼斯  國安　　（壹）　　一個春寒的早晨，我們正在床上睡的很香甜的時候，忽然茶房來敲門，說是有兩位客人從寗波來與是來看我們的！我趕忙的披衣坐起來與這時外面的朋友己經在說着：　　「對不住！驚吵你們的早睡了。」這個聲音我熟悉，他是我們隴海綫上的伙伴之一。我驚喜的不得了！　　伊，有着一對圓而亮黑的大眼睛，深長的黑睫毛，在伊的豐滿過中的臉上閃動着，伊鄒健美的身體，顯着是一個健康的女性，我的那個别了三個月的伙伴×君，他向我們這樣的介紹着說：　　「這是家姊××！」我知道伊斌是我憧憬着的愛人，我們在信紙上互談過，彷彿也熱戀過！現在我們無意中見面了，伊和我的心中的感覺，能否是一樣嗎！　　朋友，伙伴，都聚在一處了，我們談着别後的情形，我在蕪湖得「虎列拉」時，許多的朋友和伙伴，都替我擔過心，伊也表示過悲傷我這青年人的遭遇，我在這表對伊是表示着十二分的敬意！　　我和伊是不能說話的，因爲話聽不懂呵！　　我們，用紙和筆來替着說話，伊嚎解我這百戰餘生的青年人的一切，我同時也明白了，關於伊的性情，和奮鬭精神，伊有着一副很好的賢妻良母的典型，同時伊也能夠眞正瞭解戀愛的眞理。伊在這樣大的都市裏，伊純潔的本性是仍然能豎立着，那些物質上的鬼臉，並没有使伊投陈過。我們很願意，挽着手共同跑向光明的大道上去，不避任何艱險！　　（貳）　　不久，伊回到家妻去了。　　我給伊的母親寫了一封很長的信。述說我的心願，和伊的希望，在這當中的一段過程裏，我和伊同樣的焦急過，和憤怒！伊的家庭和伊的鄉里，對於我這個當過丘八的傢伙，是不表示好感的！在他們那些守舊的人們的嘴裏，我是變成了最不值錢的東西，咀嚼完還被吐出來，丢在地下或糞缸裏，伊給我的信裏是充滿了反抗的精神，這是我每次讀完，都引爲自慰的！　　感謝伊的母親，玉成了我們的心願，但是附帶着價樣的一個條件！伊是享不到所應得的權利的！我們看到這樣的條件，只有冷笑和鄙棄！　　伊，懷着熱烈的情緒，重新回到上海來，我，我的伙伴，朋友，都慶祝我們的勝利和前途的偉大，就這樣我們循着舊例。在一家中等的禮廳中，完成了我們偉大的志願！在這一天的日記裏，我這樣愉快的寫着：　　「我和××女士，於本日舉行了婚禮，我們的伙伴，朋友，都向我們倆祝福，同時又勉勵我們。在這樣熱情的戰線上。我感激得幾乎要流下淚來，我們立誓！永逺在伙伴的熱情的偉大的志願裡，我們是忠實的把生命供獻給伙伴者面前！」　　從此。我們開始了新的，偉大的，奮鬭生活。（完）東北四連長  張恨水　　第十九回　欲卽欲離同享憶往事　半哭半笑倚枕病殘秋　　秋日天短，桌上那盞淡黄色的燈，己是明亮起來，用朦朧的睡眼看起來，恰是像夢境一般。江氏大概是到裏院和趙翁談話去了，前面院子裏，是一點聲音都没有。但是聽久了，聲音也就跟着出來了，乃是半空裏的晚風，經過隔院的樹杪，括得有些響。那風帶了樹葉子括到地面上時，刷刷括括響着，一個帶病的人，靠了那高高的枕頭，用這種聲音來安慰他，這自然是越發的難受了。他想到北平近郊，巳經是這樣的凄凉了，像喜峰口這種地方，一定是更凄凉，這個時候，也許巳經穿起皮襖來了。由喜峰口自然也就想到趙連長身上去。覺得他在那種地方，過的是什麽日子，寫信回來，總要將我家母女，好好的安慰一陣，用情也算是很專的。我旣然和他訂了婚，只有一心一意的望他得着勝利，早早回來完婚，自己心裏，還横擱着一個甘積之作什麽？如此想着，覺得心裏舒適一點，就手扶了枕頭，打算坐起來。可是有了這個打算以後，半天半天，也坐不起來，自己竟是嘻嘻的笑了起來了。當他這樣笑的時候，正好江氏一脚踏了進來，只看他笑得週身肌肉顫動，這就定有原因。不過他先躺着還兀自流淚，現在他一個人又笑得這樣花枝招展，這一哭一笑，都莫明其妙，也就可怪了。（二六二）隨筆  安夫　　有人說：中國是一個比較高貴一些的妓女，只要有勢力，有金錢，就有資格佔領伊的某一部份。　　一個鋼刀刺不死的英雄，或許會在一千個人同一的目光下，有比死更難受的事發生。　　一個没有生意的律師，在報上登了一條極大的找尋重要文件的啟事：從此生意果然漸漸的好起來了。他說：如此比出了餞去登廣告還有效。　　女人穿高跟鞋，除了表現出亭亭玉立的可愛外，却還可以用作武器來擲人；這是敢新的發明。</p>

<p>談言救丐運動  韋拔　　最近上海有一個新的慈善團體出現，名爲「救丐恊會。」顧名思義，這是一個對於一般沿門托鉢，啼飢呼寒的乞丐們的救濟機關可知。實在這是「彌繕政策」的一種。　　乞丐的定義，是不事生產，而以分潤他人的生產爲生的一種階級。這其間又可分爲三種：一種是不能生產的：如老弱殘廢等是。一種是不肯生產的：如游手好閒之徒，因吃着嫖賭的結果，遂墮落而爲乞丐的。另一種則爲雖欲生產而社會無法容納，不得己而營托鉢生涯的；但此輩很容易墮入第二種類裏去。俗語說：「做了三年乞丐，皇帝也不願做」。即此意。因同樣生活在現在會中，生活固然低下，責任却可不負，形成一種超然的階級，此於乞丐之難除，也是一種成因。歸根說來，則三者的來源雖各不同，而爲社會的病態則一。倘然社會上有養老育幼與殘廢救濟制度的確立，則老弱殘廢者，便有其歸宿，而不至於呼號道路了。倘生產與消費有嚴密的規劃，則無工可作，固不會有，即不肯工作，亦屬不可能。而因有嚴密的監督，浪費的情形也無從存在。　　上海廳種得上是全中國最繁華，最富庶的地方吧？然而乞丐竟有三萬餘人，這三萬餘執業在三百六十行之外，而生活於三百六十行之中的人，他們是要生而的，要穿衣飲食的。在他們没有想到自殺以前，法律也没有方法使他們死去。他　所衣的雖然是敝衣破服，所食的，雖然是殘羹冷飯，但不能不說他們是分取了他人所生產的利益。　　在這三萬餘人中，雖無詳細統計，我們不能知道其中所含「能工作」與「不能工作」者的比例如何，但從街頭巷尾中所見的乞丐食者而論，則能工作的人，决不在於不能工作者之下，是可斷言的。能工作而至没有工作，這又是誰的罪惡呢？——至於「不肯工作」者的一類，我們是有法呌他們工作的，——不給他們生存所需要的物件，即使是一碗冷粥，與一件破舊的單衫，看他還能不工作！　　故依正規講，世上無所謂「慈善」，同情是有的。慈善的膨脹，只是罪惡的膨脹而己！若照正義來講，對於乞丐，在理論上是要救濟的——這自然是從社會的見地說，倘從乞丐的本身說，則乞丐亦人也，除了不肯生產的應擯諸社會組織以外，誰都有權利要求生存所需要的物質，何待於他人的救濟——而在事實上是無法救濟的。在理想的社會裏，對於乞丐，在理論上是不需要救濟，而在事實上也不必救濟的。爲了「獨身主義」  丁丁　　還記得在學校裏讀書的時候，我們一羣十四五歳的女孩子們，最歡喜提倡「獨身主義」。在同學中如果有人附議了我們的意思，我們才會以朋友的目光和態度去看待她們，否則我們就會鄙夷她們的。記得有一次在宿舍裏打過了睡鈴，息燈以後，我們還爲着這種事情爭着不休，事情是這樣的！我們四個人一房間，又是同班生，所以講起來更是有勁合味些。毓首先這樣的問我，「你會出嫁嗎」我說，「不無論如何不出嫁」，於是毓興高彩烈地說：「眞的嗎？那我們是同志呀」！同房間的華也就說：「我何嘗不是你們的同志呢？我們女人出嫁眞没有意思，像我們這樣多麽開心呀！没有什麽經濟的負擔，又没有什麽心思。更没有什麽拘束，我們像一隻自由的馬，能夠飛到海闊天空，現在求學，求些知識，將來學着了些謀生的技能，自賺自用，多麽自由自在。出了嫁，受那個拘束，服從那個的命令，眞麻煩死人了；况且男人又很會變心的，却使說不變心，對於生育一層，我想想我就受不了這樣的痛苦呢！……」「這樣倒是實在的。」我這樣的表示同情的說。我們三人講到熱鬧呀！唯有珍一響也不響的躺在床上。「喂·你在想什麽心思呀·你在討厭我們的談話嗎……」「喂：珍，你出嫁嗎！」我的話還没有講完，毓倒又這樣要緊的接着問。「我嗎？」珍淡然的說「談不到這種事情，但是我不敢認你們是我的同志，這種事情完全隨自然的趨勢，豈是人們所可强做的，我不敢相信不出嫁的會永逺不出嫁，亦不敢附和不出嫁提一件粗高子事　　　　　　　要說了將來的珍一定和她的那人兒並肩着走，手裏拿了熱水袋和大而方的綢絹頭，後面跟着乳奴抱着她的寳寳……」在一刹間，刻薄尖利的華竟把未的珍畫了一個典型的少奶奶的輪廓，但這口吻分明不是恭維，而是蔑視和鄙夷。於是我和毓也接着你一句我一句的說得熱鬧，什麽「珍是未來的兒女成行，子孫滿堂的福氣太太呀」之類的悄皮話便流出」。「呵！你們三人的意思完全誤會了，你們以爲不出嫁就是清高的氣概嗎！這無論如何，不能引起我的同鳴呀！你們都是太狹義的個人觀了。難道提倡了女子教育是給我們女子有機會求職業的地位，經濟的獨立而享樂了人的嗎？這樣提倡女子教育的反貽國家前途以莫大的危機呀！這樣還有誰去提倡呢！這不是女子教育的一個致命傷嗎？中國要民族復興，唯好在女子教育上打好根基，所以我們女生在校不僅爲着求學謀生，而是爲了整個民族的復興，我應該知道，中國現在還有許許多多的女子没有進過學校，所以我們現在在學校讀書的人，比較她們是幸福得多了。於是我們的責任也就更重大了，因爲我們的幸福比大家大，所以我們應該對於自己的身體道德和智識來檢查檢查，我是否以後能做良好母親而無愧呢！有些人現在拿騙人的話來麻醉女子，說許多的舊道德應該打倒的，以後的新女子不要和家，不要生小孩，甚至不要嫁人，獨身享樂。這種的麻醉劑我們是應當拒絶接受的。我們將來的想一下，假使中國充滿了，這樣的所謂新女子，試問中華民族能否免於沉淪，還有什麽復興之可言？……」　　大概是珍因惱羞成怒了，所以發了這樣大大的一篇大議論，我們也因感到掃興而漸漸入睡了。賣香瓜子的  述古　　大自然的景象，隨着季候的變換，一切都己轉入了瑟縮荒凉的狀態，枯黄的敗葉，從道傍的風景樹上，一片片地往下飄零，佈遍了滿街的角落裏。有時被一陣狂風捲起，在地上飛舞一圈，又輕輕地落下，挨受着車輪與人足的蹂躪。　　街頭四週的空氣，顯着死一般靜寂，這時行人車馬特别的稀有。一個襤褸　瘦子挽竹籃的中年婦人，沿街發出香瓜子」，尖銳的斷續的呌賣聲，打破　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　每天都是這樣的：阿二嫂一早從飯鍋的鹽水中，取出先夜浸浴在裏面的葵瓜子，然後生火炒熟，裝入破爛的竹藍裏，讓臥病難起的丈夫，在家帶管二個孩兒，自己提着這一籃香瓜子，跑向十字街頭，沿街呌賣着。　　一串串的「香瓜子」的呌賣聲，在空中播揚一會以後，隨即歸於消失，阿二嫂每發出一聲，老是鼓起耳膜靜聽着，行程奔過了縱横錯雜的幾道長馬路，終於無一主顧承買的回響。　　「香瓜子」，她意識到這樣全不是生意經，馬上另覓出賣的市塲，此刻她已轉入一個洋樓高厦的大弄堂裏。　　她在這裏可眞大發利市了。許多摩登女郎和孩童們都競相購買着，香香她們的被珍饈油膩了的嘴口。雖然她們青筋紅臉的與她爭多補少，阿二嫂也一心一意的容忍着，指望多些成交，因爲每天一家四口的生命線，就全繫在「香瓜子」這生意上面。　　阿二嫂的肚子，此時還那麽空洞洞的，實在感覺有些耐不住了。她掏出六個銅子，在弄堂口轉角的一家燒餅店裏買了兩隻燒餅，一塊塊的往嘴裏塞，馬上一身輕鬆了許多。繼續向前行進！無意中折入了比較寛敞的空場左。獨輪手車擺得滿滿的。懶洋洋地高據在車頭上打盹的一大批車夫，被這突然的呌聲驚醒了，一齊嚷着「買香瓜子」，頓時層層地把阿二嫂圍困在垓心。　　「哎喲，要死的！」不知誰在阿二嫂的大腿！擰了一把，逼得她忍不住的直呌起來，引起全塲的一陣哄笑。　　「你阿二病是啥辰光起的？你可……」一個頭上挽着辮結的麻皮大漢，一面這麽向她搭訕着；又𢭵了𢭵嘴，對另一些人使了一下鬼臉。阿二嫂却一本正經的只裝没聽見，連睬也不睬。　　天色更加隂森森的，朔風也格外起勁地刮着，阿二嫂抖索着身子，踏着沉重的脚步，滿街亂竄着，不知不覺巳快近黄昏了。　　阿二嫂眷念着家裏病人的無人照拂，想起孩兒們在家啼飢哭娘的慘景，帶着萬重酸辛氣氛，跑上了歸家的途中，嘴裏仍舊發出「香瓜子」的呌賣聲，希冀還能賣得三數枚，回家去也好措施一些，可是終於没人過問。　　她從袋裏取出當日所賣得的銅子過細一數，恰好還有二十五個，她順道，買了二十個子的大米，兩個子的蘿蔔干，還花兩個半買了一盒火柴，誰備這一天僅有的一頓晚餐的資料。</p>

<p>慰烈火君  一蘋　　我認識烈火君在本館的會客室中，由本刋的編輯先生介紹，雙方都像很熟識似的没有一句「久仰」等寒喧話就攀談起來，是後互相抄了一個通訊處約着時常通信的，可是我在電臺上擔任了一點事，日夜禁閉在一間狹小的播音室中，簡實没有餘閒的時候分離開那架電機來幹我自己的事。烈火君的通訊處在我的鉛絲籃内安放之後，就永逺没有第二次的會面了。說起來對於一個初交的朋友不應該那樣地失信，然而我自信烈火君和我是在同等地位下做人，我們的時間是被經濟支配好了的。這句話或者是我以己度人，然而在我們短短的二十分談話中，烈火君的環境，我的話不致於十分失敗。　　對於本刋上的投稿諸若，烈火君以爲太没有聯絡，很相由一個發起人召集幾個同志，大家聚聚，我最初也有這個意思，惟恐被人認爲我們有包辦的性質，這種誤會是容易引起莫須有的罪名的烈火君那天談起了這問題，我是竭力贊同。……就我們幾個熟識的人先聯絡起來，我想響影來的一定不少同志。這一次見面後，我們的電台就正式播音，我擔任的事雖是那樣輕鬆無奇，一個身體却日夜没有空閒，談過的事早己忘懷了。　　最近在本刋上見到烈火君的悽傷之心，原來是他老人家過世了。烈火君說的一口河南話，他的故鄉大概是河南了。一個人離别了故鄉千里迢迢的趕到一個環境中來，他有一種不得已的苦衷存在；雖然我們的談話没有講到這些。　　我自己二歳死了父親，父親的面貌音容在我懂事之後僅僅在那張褪了色的照像上去認識了。有人說過，死去了親生母，再在後母的手中過活，要是父親再是個不明亮的人，這種生活是世界最苦的了。不過我認爲死去了父親或者有更甚的痛苦。總之，都要身受的人纔能明瞭其中的苦况。這點，烈火君比我還幸福得多——比我没有見父親一面的人幸福得多！烈火君，你老人家死了，老人家的精神還遺留在你身上，至少，我相信。　　你認爲不能回到故鄉而痛苦嗎？烈火君，我的故鄉僅要一點鐘火車的行程，然面我不能回到故鄉去，故鄉不是屬於我的，我到了那裏，那裏就是我的故鄉。在這樣美的秋末冬初，常常使我生起懷鄉病來，不過我是不能回到故鄉去的－烈火君，河南離上海還未逺，但是終有一天你能回到故鄉去的，河南終於還是你的故鄉啊！　　朋友，我希望能有一個機會，我們泡一壺清茶來談上半天。在荆棘的人生道上，努力罷！你老人家的精神遺留在你的身上，至少，我相信。造謡與闢  謡光漢　　一逢時局　盪之際，社會上謡言常特别盛。謡言盛，則人心惑，而時局愈呈「風雨滿城」之狀。於是便有人出來闢謡。　　查謡言的來原，不外五種。一種是憑空揑造的。利用不靜的時機，造作風影，以亂聽聞，使時局動摇加劇，以便有所舉動。一種是胡猜瞎測的。分析時局進展的情勢，妄下主觀的揣度，分造出來的。一種是人傳聞之訛的。即所謂道聽塗說」，「一人傳虚，百人傳實。」一種是存心中傷的。故意散播於某方不利的聲息，以挫其氣勢。還有一種就是由醖釀中的事實所變成的。當事實未暴發之先，這事實也會流爲一種謡言。　　謡言給與時局的影響很大，社會上每因謡言之來，人心便愈覺皇皇然，時局也就愈增其混亂。蓋謡言雖不過是一種謡言而已，但謡言往往亦會變成事實。　　社會上一發生了謡言，就有人想出來闢謡。闢謡云者，闢其所謡之誕妄，之没根據，之不可信，其用意端在遏止謡言的傳布，以安人心，而定時局。然而闢謡者有時也難呌人盡信。因闢謡者往往不僅闢其所虚謡，即連彰彰顯著的事實，也要强加以剖解。故謡言越闢而現代名人書畫張禹聲先生字韜公虞山人越熾，甚至愈顯出其眞實性。在這裏，闢謡者之所闢，比造謡者之所造，更不可靠。故我以爲謡言經有事實可證明，眞正的謡言，即不闢亦自息，若果所謡是事實，則闢之亦無益哩。　　來函　編輯先生：　　在鹽城西北六十多里的我們鄉鎭裏，近忽發現（地質？）的嚮動，異常驚人，據蟲有來滬人傳說和親友來函，把重要情形寫在下面：　　從十一月十三日晚起，猛聽得打雷似的嚮聲，隨即全地震動；以後每天動的時間雖相差不一，都是那樣斷續不停的嚮震數次。訪問較逺的四面隣鄉，並没有發覺；大家這才知道旣不是異常的地震，又不是轟炸的砲聲；因此，我鄉迷信頭腦的父老，謡言妖語，都呈現着非常的恐怖。寫信來質疑於我，我雖知一定是地層的變幻，但又不知其所以然，可去解答破除妖異充滿他們—父老—的腦海。特此函請先生在　貴欄内割一角餘地，登載出來給大衆們研討，好呌我得結果回信去安釋他們無意識的恐懼的心理，一方面使得人們有科學上的常識，想先生一定肯樂從的吧？祝撰祺　陶海仙寫於十二月五日小說上海（十四）  張老三　　高飛問我弟弟什麽時候能到上海，被愚笨的小黄放了支冷箭。　　「兩個戀愛專家的三角戀愛，」矮冬瓜滿意的笑了。　　高飛比較是忠厚的年青人，他以爲在一對戀人未便正式宣佈之先，太露骨的打趣，常引起對方的難堪。他忙向小黄示意，然而敏姊明知是對她發的俏皮話，她反問小黄：　　「黄先生，你願意加入四角戀愛嗎？」　　我，誰，都不料的問句，矮冬瓜雖也能和着人家的笑，他認爲失敗無論如何是掩飾不了。　　廿三法國公園　　黄昏時候，我們散步着踏進了法國公園，這舊時的游地，我依稀認識池畔新栽的小樹，巳經能迎風招舞了。我們沿着黄沙新舖的曲徑，慢慢地走去，能夠聽清風吹樹葉的絮語。一對年青的伴侣，像被人發現了秘密似的男的佯作咳嗽，敏姊微笑着仰起頭來，我也隨和着笑了。　　曲徑盡頭是緑錦如茵的草地，我們互相投了會意的一瞥，在冬青樹旁的鐵椅上坐了，望着飛奔的白雲，默默地被大自然的靜穆溶化了。　　我無意地伸手到袋中掏出一匣紙烟，一想没有火柴，重放進袋裏。　　「什麽？」　　「没有火柴。」　　「走走罷？」　　同時站起身來。　　「怎老不開口？」　　「你呢？」我笑了，敏姊也笑。　　「想着你慧姊？」她像逃避似的跳前幾步。</p>

<p>電影專刊電影史上有名大失敗的事蹟（中）  嘉榖譯　　當然一位高傲的失敗者，總有些「天亡我，非戰之罪」的氣概。他們總要找些諉罪的話。不是說那張影片太藝術化了，就是說普通一般社會程度太低不能了解的作品。這種推諉的話，要是講到像ＢrokenＢilssoms，或是地米爾的ＴheＷhisperingＣhorus等片子，可以說是實在的。但是在别的地方，我們可以說錯處都是在製片家而不在普通社會的。比如那張却爾斯雷（ＣharlesＲay）所演的ＴhcＣourtshiposＭilesＳtandish却爾斯雷本來是美國當初最偉大的明星，不過因爲他在那張片子裏，死得像一條狗，扮得太卑賤了，他因此而失却觀衆的崇拜心，而晦黑了他的前途。不僅如此却爾斯雷一生的積蓄，六十萬美金，他統通投資在這張影片裏而失掉了。論到那張片子的内容，是半冷不熱的，對於觀衆是毫無感動力的。　　那齊摩伐（ＡilaＮazimova）亦因爲要扮演王爾德（ＯscarＷilde）的花花女（Ｓalome），自己走了一條絶路，因而一去而不復返了。那齊摩伐的企圖太偉大了，她要向一般商業化的製片家，證明銀幕亦是能吸收多量的藝術的。但是那張片子竟吸收了她多量的金錢，她相信美國的觀衆是具有藝術的靈魂的，但是他們的靈魂竟呼喚不出來。　　你要是不完全依據公道，而偏向於苛刻的話，你可以說道種失敗，都是由於明星們自己虚榮心太重的緣故。他們非但要自己的星亮，並且要自己决定怎樣地亮法。但是這種的判罪，是不實在的。第一樣，我們要知道一張影片的製造，是，許多人有聯帶關係的。明星演員，和導演，雖然直接因失敗而受譴責，並且自己受到苦楚，但是失敗亦正和成功一樣，是憎於一個完全團體的全部的。我們知道一家公司的全部職員演員，在决定拍攝一張影片的時候，一定是多半相信那張片子會成功的。要是一家公司，它的職員演員没有這樣的信心，那這家公司的工作，簡捷是不知所云了，等到那張片子果然成功了，你也居功，我也居功。　　失敗的種子，亦是不知不覺地在這種强烈的，麻醉的自信心中種下了。大家都相信將來的成功，即使有偶然懷疑的時候，但是大多數的演員們，技術人等，製片家總覺得那張片子出來，一定會受社會歡迎的。總而言之，在旁觀者清晰的眼光看起來，即使那種片子，是很明顯地要失敗的，亦没有人敢出來阻止拍攝的進行，在一般人的頭上，澆一桶冷水的。其實，在製片子的時候，製片家在觀衆告訴他喜歡不喜歡之前，大部份是不曉得到底會成功不會成功的。一則所謂當局者迷，二則到了騎虎難下的時候，亦祇可以破釜沉舟地前進了。　　（未完）影片談評「女性的追逐」評　ＭyＷeakness  摩爾　　「麗琳哈蕙」是歐洲的明星，好萊塢的影片商，因爲她能夠號召觀衆，不惜重金的把她請到美國。而「女性的追逐，」更是編劇者爲了她而編製的劇本。劇本爲了演員而編，自然會適合演員的個性，而容易發揮他的長處。像「麗琳哈蕙，」本來是以嬌小活潑見長，「女性的追逐」中，飾一個適合性情的角色，她的成功并不出乎意外的。　　「麗琳哈蕙」最適合的角色，恕我用一句成語就是「小家碧玉。」在名片「龍翔鳳舞」裏，她是飾一個店員。「女性的追逐」裏，她又飾一婢女。大體講來，德國片的作風是較爲沉重，而美國片，較爲活潑。所謂「作風」是導演的手法，和演員的表演的總和，兩者假使一不調和，他的不成功是一定的。所以，「麗琳哈蕙」在「龍翔鳳舞，」最好的地方，是小動作較多的馬車過街的長鏡頭；而不在到了俄皇公館的活潑表情。現在「女性的追逐」裏，她是配合着活潑的手法而發揮個性了。是導演者帮助了「麗琳哈蕙，」也是「麗琳哈蕙」成功了導演者。　　自然，導演的特别長處，是可以指出的。像心理觀察的仔細，人情世故的練達。這種是導演者平日的修養，而在剏作上引用出來，我覺得只在攝影塲中研侒的作家，是應該因此而有所覺悟的，「鏡頭」根本是代表觀衆的觀察！　　編劇者爲了「麗琳哈蕙」而編劇，導演者洞悉了這種人的心理而導演。「女性的追逐」的成功，是决定的了。劉亞里斯雖則在過去演過很好的戲，在這裏并没有特殊的成功。　　至於「女性的追逐」的意義，我覺得在男性中心的社會裏，在私有經濟的現狀之下，下層女子只有「賣淫來維持他們的生活」的金言，是完全正確。而上層的女子也只能利用她的姿色來滿足她的一切。這是不必講的。　　「戀愛」是給舊藝術家看成超現實的，至高無上的；而實際上一切「戀愛」都有條件。像本片中少爺的不肯和婢女戀愛，一方面爲了他是婢女，另一方面因爲生活問題，而最後的結合，簡直是變相的獨佔间意識的表現，自然「郎才女貌」是製作者有意之歪曲。　　「愛神的金箭」只是通過了金錢纔能射中人心！評「飛閣疑雲」Ｐenlhouse  凌鶴　　據說中國的聲片在南洋並不像默片那般賣座，其理由不外是南洋的觀衆聽不懂對白。同樣，美國有些聲片，也不是中國觀衆並遍的歡迎，以上的理由也可以得着同樣的解釋吧。特别是複雜的劇情都隱藏在對白中的時候，更爲熱心的觀衆所厭惡。美國影片所以翻成歐美各國的版本，其原因也就在此。那末，爲什麽没有中國版呢？這當然是中國電影市場遇於貧弱，這在製片者的如意算盤上乃是非常不合算的。　　以上，當我看過「飛閣疑雲」之後，立刻在腦筋中又浮起這種見解。這還不是明顯的事實嗎？當我夾在人叢中走出戲院的時候，立刻聽着人說：「我簡直看不懂」，另一個小姐問一位老女人道：「好不好？」老婦說：「我聽勿懂外國閒話，　哈道理。」當然，我並不完全因着大光明賣座不及往日那般熱鬧，（大上海的新開張也是減少觀衆的原因，）然而這種影片不受中國人歡迎，乃是十分顯著的事實。　　但是，是否完全由於賣座的多寡而决定影片的優劣呢？當然這是再愚笨不過的事。至少我們得肯定這裏的作者，確是十分努力的。導演對於幾個主要人物的性格描寫，都一貫的，嚴密的把握着而使觀衆得着完善的了解。惡棍的粗大的身軀和笨重的姿態，再清楚没有的活寫出他狂暴而忠直的個性。由於青年在獄時額上的汗滴，很明白的說明了他是入世未深而不能容忍絲毫苦楚，其在慘殺案是一個寃枉的嫌疑犯，誰也可以於此肯定。　　說到這裏，我們可看出這一影片雖然應當屬於偵探片之列，可是它和一般恐怖而緊張的偵探片大不相同，至少它這裏没有用疑雲重疊，聲東擊西的方法。原來作者不過是藉此來完成一個戀愛的故事。　　可不是麽？劇作者很曲折的來說明這一故事。甲男失戀於乙女，乙女又和丙男發生愛情，丙男再與丁女斷絶糾纏，丁女及與戊男重叙舊歡，到後來，甲男和己女好合以終。請大家想想罷，這裏的男女糾紛該有多少。然而劇作者的用意却並不在男女間的浪漫史方面，其主題倒是爲現社會而作正面的說教。大律師以其詭辯釋放了一個惡徒，使其免遭死刑而逍遥法外。當然大律師免不了受着社會正義的批判，甚至於愛人亦與之離異。到後來，大律師終於爲社會除暴而十分努力，結果作惡多端的惡徒，「放下屠刀，立地成佛」的槍擊了殺人兇犯，自己亦自戕以死。——於是，這一大律師再受着人們的同情，多少是有作爲而勇敢的堂堂男子了。　　然而在另一方面我們却看到法律這東西，是多　滑稽的東西啊，一個律師居然可使惡棍得免於死，反之，要殘殺無辜的人們，又何嘗没有適當的法律根據，幾個配角都演得很賣力，而主角華納裴士又是成功的了。聯華聯歡大會展期　　聯華影業公司同仁聯歡大會，原定於本月六日在聯華第一廠内舉行。然日來因廠方製片工作頗形緊張，而聯歡會本身之游藝内容，亦需要充實準備，因有延會之議，聞該會籌備委員會亦以此次大會爲聯華全體同仁精誠合作之最好表示，未可倉卒舉行。兹定在下星期内待廠方工作告一段落，當集中全力從速促其實現，俾此盛大　，早告圓滿。雪爾維薛耐去而復返  東林　　—已與派拉蒙公司妥協—　　當雪爾維薛耐突然脫離派拉蒙公司後，美國電影界曾引起很大的衝動。雪爾維自從脫退了派拉蒙，就搭了輪船到歐洲去了。神精過敏的因而謡傳她將要與法國電影界訂合同了。然而謡傳終歸是謡傳面已。雪爾維在歐洲醫好了喉嚨，又乘了船回美了。這一次，好萊塢的影界又注意起她今後的行止了，爲的是，他們都知道美國的各影片公司决不會僱用她的。誰料雪爾維忽然又和派拉蒙公司成立了和解，訂了妥恊條約。她的第一次作品，名呌「再結合」（Ｒernou）電影小說花蕚情深（ＬittleＷoman（三）  素因　　到了晚上，勞倫斯家的孩子又在窗口張望了。他看見馬區家裏點了燈，他們在扮戲。奇奥扮的是强盜，穿了長統靴。一回兒奇奥又扮了一位英雄。美格扮的是一個老妖怪。亞梅扮着一位公王。蓓絲扮的是一個受警嚇的童子。他們戲做完了，大家拍著手。漢娜進來請他們去吃晚飯了。他心裏又著急，又快活，因爲馬區家膳室的窗户給窗紗遮住了。使他看不出他們發現了奇蹟之後。怎樣歡躍的形狀！但他知道他們一定會受到一個快活的驚嚇的。　　馬區家的孩子們一齊進了膳室。奇奥頭一個看見了桌上擺著一桌豐盛的筵席，她就喊了出來·「克立斯多弗哥倫布！這是什麽？」亞栙经張大了嘴，眼睛睜得圓的道：仙人來了嗎」？蓓絲道：「這一定是聖誕老人送來的！」美格問題：「是不是姑母送來的？」媽嬭對他們大家笑了一笑說道：「這是對門的勞倫絲老先生送來的。今天你們早上做的事，不知怎樣給那位老先生知道了，他就送了這許多東西來，並且還有一封信，上面說今天是聖誕節，他要送些小東西給小姑娘們吃的，呌我不要拒絶。」大家聽了，歡喜得都不能相信了。那個勞倫斯老頭子，一向總當他是個老怪物的！常常的坐在一輛華美的馬車裏，小姑娘們都不敢向他說一聲早安的，這眞是件怪事了。「這一定是他孫子替他出的主意——我曉得的，」當他們坐下的時候，奇奥這樣說。她想起她要和他認識的决心，更使她堅定了些。　　到了明天，門口又下了許多雪。奇奥穿了橡皮長統靴，在門口拿著掃帚剷子清除那一夜的積雪。她一時高興，又拿那雪堆作了一個雪人。她又想起她昨天的决心，就抓了一把雪，作了一個輕鬆的雪球，朝着勞倫斯家的窗户擲了過去。說時遲，那時快。對面的窗户推開了，一個嬉笑的面孔對著她。那正是勞倫斯老先生的孫子。他喊著：「哈囉！」奇奥又裝著莊重的樣子，說了一聲：你好。」接著她又說：「我要謝謝你呢。你們送來的聖誕禮物，我們都很快活的享受了。」她又看見那孩子拿他的衣襟拉緊了蓋住他的胸口，她又問道：「怎麽？你不大舒服嗎？」那孩子道：「不過有些傷風。我祖父讓我在屋子裏養一個禮拜就好了。」奇奥道：「那不悶嗎？你作什麽消遣呢？」他摇著頭說他一些消遣都没有，奇奥又問：「人家可以不可以來看看你呢？」他說：「祇要人家肯來，那有不可以的道理。」奇奥聽見了，立即奔回去問媽嬭去了。一回兒她得到媽嬭的允許，又奔了出來。她走上勞倫斯家的台階，靜候著裏面的人來開門。（未完）</p>

When passing through Hong Kong on the morning of the 9th, they will first meet with Hu Zhantang, and then go to Guangzhou to meet with Chen Jitang and other central committee members to exchange opinions. If time permits, they also plan to go to Guangxi to meet with Li Zongren and Bai Chongxi, and are scheduled to return before the Fourth Plenary Session to attend. According to one of the committee members speaking to reporters, the task of the Central Government sending them to Guangdong is to invite central committee members from the Southwest to come to Beijing to participate in the Fourth Plenary Session, and to explain that the Shanghai Truce Agreement was signed out of necessity, as well as the recent diplomatic situation in North China, requesting the Southwest's understanding. Regarding the Fujian Incident, they hope the Southwest will jointly take responsibility for resolving it, so as not to hinder the anti-banditry work. At the same time, the Southwest's views on the Fujian Incident are largely the same as the Central Government's. At this time of national crisis and ongoing banditry, the Central Government earnestly hopes that committee members from the Southwest will unite and gather in the Central Government to discuss national affairs together. If they have suggestions and methods, they can submit them to the meeting for joint discussion. If they are indeed beneficial to the party and the country, the Central Government will adopt them. They also hope that they will not be polite during the meeting, and that their attitude towards the Central Government will be slightly more peaceful after leaving the meeting. Although the outcome of this trip cannot be predicted in advance, it is certain that a portion of the committee members, in addition to those who are unable to attend due to their duties, will come to Beijing to attend.

<p>(Nanjing) Zhang Ji told reporters that their trip to Hong Kong is to urge central committee members from the Southwest to come to Beijing together to discuss national affairs, with the country as the premise. As for his personal attitude, he will, in a private capacity, explain the Central Government's intentions and all recent administrative policies in detail, hoping that central committee members from the Southwest will not harbor suspicions due to misunderstandings, and instead leave an opportunity for outsiders to exploit. Regarding other political systems and all important issues, if central committee members from the Southwest have opinions to express, they should directly communicate with the Central Government by telegram, or come to Beijing to attend the Fourth Plenary Session, to openly discuss and seek the unity of the party to cope with the national crisis.

<p>(Nanjing) Wang Luyi said that this trip to Guangdong is a central government dispatch. If time permits when passing through Shanghai, he may meet with central committee members staying in Shanghai to exchange opinions. When passing through Hong Kong, he will meet with Hu Zhantang, and then go to Guangzhou to meet with Chen Bonan and other central committee members. However, whether or not to go to Guangxi will be decided after observing the situation in Guangdong. Rumors of the Southwest organizing a third government are definitely untrue.

<p>(Nanjing) The Central Government has sent five committee members, Zhang Ji, Chen Zhaoying, Ma Chaojun, Wang Luyi, and Fu Bingchang, to Guangdong and Hong Kong to contact local central committee members and exchange opinions.

If time permits, they may also travel to Guangxi. They are scheduled to return to Beijing before the opening of the plenary session. (7th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Ju Zheng said that the Fourth Plenary Session will definitely not be postponed. Central committee members from various places should set out for Beijing immediately.

It is also reported that more than 70 central committee members from various places have telegraphed that they will arrive in Beijing before the 20th to attend, and more than 100 people in Beijing and Shanghai. The above statutory number of attendees is no longer a problem. (7th Special Dispatch)</p>

It is clear that major towns such as Jian'ou and Jianyang are now in the hands of the Central Army, and the Fujian army would have no way to fly over.

<h3>Internal Dissension within the Fujian Faction</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) A person from Fujian said: (1) After Quanzhou and Shaxian were bombed by Central Government aircraft, Fuzhou greatly strengthened its air defense, erecting two anti-aircraft guns on the high buildings of Nanwei in the city, causing great panic among the people. (2) Although there are widespread rumors in Fujian of attacking Guangdong and Zhejiang, military sources say that they are currently still defending and have not started attacking. (3) The various factions of the puppet government are vying with each other, and officers and soldiers in the military are also very suspicious of Chen and Li's actions, losing heart and morale. It may collapse soon. (4) Fujian and the Communist Party are originally using each other, a temporary compromise. Therefore, Communist propaganda is still ostensibly anti-Fujian, but in reality, many Communists are going to Fujian and working hard to organize the masses and establish a "dual government," using the People's Government as the facade and the Soviet as the core. Therefore, the Communist Youth League is already operating semi-openly, and the internal leaders of the puppet government have even more divergent opinions, and cracks are already visible. (5) Weng Zhaoyuan has recruited more than 6,000 local troops and bandits, with about 4,000 guns, and divided them into four detachments and four battalions. Cai Tingkai plans to reorganize them into the 7th Army, with Weng as the army commander. Another saying is that they will be reorganized into the People's Self-Defense Army, incorporating all the local militias in southern Fujian, with Weng still serving as commander. (6) Cai Tingkai strongly advocates revising the political program, automatically making concessions to Hu Hanmin and the Gui clique in order to gain sympathy. However, the Social Democratic Party and the Cancellation Faction around Chen Mingshu firmly insist that the political program cannot be revised. It is said that Li Jishen has agreed to revise the political program and advocates no longer mentioning the slogan of land revolution. (7th Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Zhang Zhen Discusses the Fujian Situation; Liu's Troops Can Serve as a Barrier on the Zhejiang Border; The Fujian Rebellion Can Be Resolved Soon</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Central Committee member Zhang Zhen said that after the Fujian Incident occurred, the Central Government took a magnanimous approach and used political methods to resolve it. However, Chen Mingshu and others are stubbornly unrepentant, openly declaring their secession from the Kuomintang. This kind of act of destroying the party is not allowed within the party. Recalling the bloody battle of the 19th Route Army in Shanghai, they were admired by the people of the country. This time, they were used by a few people to rebel against the party, which is truly regrettable. Currently, the military strength of the 19th Route Army is only about 30,000 to 40,000 people, and they are all newly recruited soldiers. Lu Xingbang's troops, because they are within his sphere of influence, are said to have joined the rebellion. Liu Heding is currently occupying northern Fujian alone, holding Yanping and other places, and can serve as a barrier on the Zhejiang border, preventing him from joining the rebellion. The Central Government's approach to the Fujian Incident is that if a political solution is hopeless, it will use military force to deal with it, which has been handed over to the military authorities. Now, the Fujian army is afraid of a large-scale Central Government punitive expedition and has deployed defenses on the Zhejiang border. As for the attitudes of Guangdong and Guangxi, they should cooperate with the Central Government, hoping to eliminate the Fujian rebellion as soon as possible and jointly respond to foreign aggression. It is predicted that this Fujian rebellion will not expand, and it may be resolved in the near future. However, it is foreseeable that the people of Fujian will suffer from this incident. As for the government appointing Zhang Zhizhong as the Pacification Commissioner of Zhejiang Province and the Commander-in-Chief of the Forward, it is likely to be true and will be decided soon. The Fourth Plenary Session is about to open, and I hope that central committee members from the Southwest will be mindful of the current national crisis and resolutely come to Beijing to protect and save the perilous situation.

(2) We have drafted certain principles to avoid political issues. (3) For train service measures, anything that does not involve political or other issues can be discussed.

<h3>The Navy Inspects a British Ship; The British Consulate Lodge a Protest</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) After the Fujian Incident occurred, in order to prevent criminals from smuggling military supplies to support it, the government specially ordered all Shanghai-Fujian-Hong Kong ships to temporarily suspend sailing, and foreign ships must also be inspected. A few days ago, the Ewo Company's Hengsheng ship arrived in Fujian from Hong Kong. When entering the port, our Yixian warship ordered it to stop and sent troops to board and inspect the ship. The British Consulate in Beijing believes that port inspections hinder business and has lodged a protest with our government, requesting exemption from inspection or joint inspection with British warships. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs believes that this matter is the duty of the Navy Department and will discuss it with the Navy Department for further review. (7th Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>The Solution to Mongolian Autonomy Is Comfortable</h3>
<p>The issue of Inner Mongolian autonomy, following requests from the Mongols, consideration and investigation by the Central Government, has been developing for several months. Now, the general outline of autonomy has been decided, stipulating the powers of the autonomous region government, establishing the source of autonomous funding, and clearly defining the relationships between the various autonomous regions. In the future, it will only require Inner Mongolian leagues and banners to implement it, and the Central Government to guide its implementation, in order to gradually achieve the effect of autonomy. The consolidation of the border areas and the elimination of ethnic barriers will also be seen in this process. The Inner Mongolian region originally had six leagues, twenty-four departments, and forty-nine banners. However, after the September 18th Incident, Longjiang was lost, Liaoning and Jilin were occupied, and Rehe was lost. This led to the four eastern leagues of Jerim League, Josutu League, and Zhao Uda League falling into foreign hands. Now, only the Xilin Gol League belongs to our country. However, the Xilin Gol League is geographically larger and strategically more important among the four eastern leagues. Prince De is the Deputy League Leader of the Xilin Gol League and is a rising star among the Inner Mongolian princes, with promising talent in the future. The western two leagues are also gradually being developed and are in the process of transforming from a pastoral economy to an agricultural economy. At a time when the world economic panic has not yet subsided and general politics are still in a period of transition, Inner Mongolia borders Japan to the east and Outer Mongolia to the north. The influence of both sides not only makes it difficult for Inner Mongolia to cope but will also affect the entire border defense of North China. If measures are inappropriate, it could easily develop into a more serious phenomenon than it is today.</p>
<p>Neighboring countries have been eyeing our borders for more than just a day or two. Since the completion of the Trans-Siberian Railway and around the time of the Russo-Japanese War, our country has been in a passive position. At that time, the Qing government was incompetent, allowing others to divide and control us, and we had no ability to defend ourselves. Since the Republic of China, this situation has not improved much. Outer Mongolia's secession is a prominent example. Because of this, it has further fueled the ambitions of strong neighbors, and it has become increasingly difficult for our country to cope. Recently, internal disputes in Xinjiang have been lingering and unclear, and it has not been easy to find an appropriate solution to the relationship between the Hui and Han peoples. As for Tibet, its foreign relations are also not simple, and the danger in the future may be even greater than that of Xinjiang. For the Mongol, Hui, and Tibetan ethnic groups, there is still a tendency toward the Central Government, and it is not too late to save the situation in time. Inner Mongolian autonomy has already begun. As long as the central government provides appropriate guidance and the provinces of Chahar and Suiyuan can sincerely help, then Inner Mongolia will gradually develop good and cordial feelings with the Han people in the future. Over time, they will merge into one, and there will be no more ethnic boundaries. However, at the beginning of the implementation of autonomy, before the historical customs have been completely eliminated, we earnestly hope that the authorities, especially those responsible for local politics in Chahar and Suiyuan, will pay attention and work hard on economic and political construction. At the same time, they must not neglect the particularities of Inner Mongolia. If these particularities can be led appropriately, then even if strong neighbors are evil, they will have no way to implement their malicious plans, and the borders will be able to obtain a solid foundation as a result.</p>
<p>What are the particularities within the Inner Mongolian region? It would be tedious and lengthy to discuss them separately. To summarize and generalize, they can be roughly divided into the following three points. Due to the limitations of geography and climate, nomadic herding is most suitable for Inner Mongolia. Therefore, its general economy belongs to the pastoral economy. This is well known to the world. However, human history is constantly evolving. Although progress is sometimes slow and sometimes fast, there is never permanent stagnation or immutability. Because of inconvenient transportation, Mongolia's progress has been slower. However, it is now making rapid progress towards an agricultural economy, and the trend is extremely clear. During this transition period, the political relations at the upper level will also be affected in the same way. Establishing new norms and opening up future paths will happen at this time. This is the first thing to pay attention to when guiding Inner Mongolian autonomy.</p>
<p>Because Inner Mongolia's economy is more backward than agricultural societies, general culture and education are almost non-existent. There is a great deal of separation from the Han people, with either no understanding at all or blind barbarism. How can they be expected to resist strong enemies together and defend the borders? Therefore, laws should first be enacted to improve animal husbandry and make it suitable for modern needs. Then, educate the honest Mongol people, and it will not be difficult for them to become trained citizens in a few years. Then, the communication of general culture and the implementation of enlightening education are the most urgent tasks at present. This is the second thing to pay attention to when guiding Inner Mongolian autonomy. Religious customs should be given strict attention. On the one hand, Mongol knowledge should be enlightened, and scientific ideas should be gradually introduced. On the other hand, past historical connections should not be ignored. The daily life of nomads should be carefully studied in order to gradually improve it. This is the third thing to pay attention to when guiding Inner Mongolian autonomy.</p>
<p>The above three points are based solely on the general social situation. Although there may be some differences in the actual implementation of politics, the fundamental construction of the economy, and the technical aspects, the basic principles are the same.</p>
<h3>Zhang Xueliang Scheduled to Leave Europe and Return to China</h3>

He plans to stay in Rome for a few days before going to Brindisi. According to those close to Zhang, he will meet with members of the National Government to discuss everything as soon as he returns to China. Zhang also told friends before leaving here that he intends to reconcile the opinions of all parties in order to end the civil war and unify the country. It is reported that Zhang telegraphed Nanjing, stating that he was willing to return to the country to support the government, but if he was asked to participate in the civil war, he would rather stay overseas.

The land totals ten million acres and has been allocated based on the 1928 agreement between Soviet Russia and Jewish people who wanted to establish a Jewish republic. (7th Reuters Telegraph)</p>
<h3>Italy's Prime Minister, with Lofty Ambitions, Advocates a Movement to Reform the League of Nations; Tends to Conclude a Seven-Power Pact to Control the World; Attempts to Shift from Idealism to Realism; But Tries Hard to Avoid Taking Unilateral Action</h3>
<p>Rome Although the Pan-Fascist Congress decided on Italy's attitude towards the League of Nations the day before yesterday, advocating a fundamental reform of the League of Nations, well-informed sources believe that this resolution does not stipulate that Italy will be the first to propose a plan to reform the League of Nations. It is said that the Pan-Fascist Congress meets four or five times a year to decide on the theoretical program of Italian policy. As for this theoretical program becoming practical action, it is up to the government. Furthermore, this resolution of the Pan-Fascist Congress will inevitably cause debate in all aspects and requires preparation in terms of public opinion. Only after this preparation can a plan to reform the League of Nations be proposed. Before the Pan-Fascist Congress made this resolution, there was no diplomatic talk about reforming the League of Nations. (7th Havas Telegraph)</p>
<p>Rome According to well-informed sources here, Italy has no intention of taking the initiative to reorganize the League of Nations. The announcement released yesterday was only a hope that the major powers could diplomatically propose to the League of Nations to reorganize, and to propose it at a meeting of the League of Nations Executive Council. Official sources here formally deny the rumor that the Fascist Party Congress will draft a plan to reorganize the League of Nations. (6th Reuters Telegraph)</p>
<p>Rome It was recently learned from reliable sources that Britain and France have guaranteed to support Italy's major reorganization of the League of Nations. Although Italian Prime Minister Mussolini still tends to conclude a Seven-Power Pact to control world peace, at present, it is enough to complete the Five-Power Pact and bind the Western European countries. As for the League of Nations reorganization plan that Italy wants to propose, it is expected to be a fundamental reform, greatly deleting the idealism instilled by the original initiator, President Wilson, because Mr. Mo is an excessively realistic faction and may not fully trust Wilson's idealism. However, Mr. Mo is also not sure that the price Italy requires to remain in the League of Nations can be fully achieved, so he has considered the result of withdrawing from the League of Nations, believing that if it is unavoidable, even becoming isolated is not to be regretted, because with Germany, Russia, Japan, and the United States outside the League of Nations, Italy will become isolated, but it may not last long. Moreover, there are many opportunities to form alliances outside the League of Nations, especially in the Near East, because Russia and Turkey both welcome Italy as a supporter to control the eastern Mediterranean.

<h3>Li Weinuofu Hastily Returns to Moscow, Staying in Berlin for Only a Few Hours, Not Meeting with German Authorities (Berlin) Soviet Foreign Commissar Li Weinuofu arrived here this morning from Rome. There were rumors that Li Weinuofu would stay in Berlin for several days and visit German Foreign Minister Neurath, but this is not true. Li Weinuofu only stayed here for a few hours and departed for Moscow at 6 pm. He did not meet with any representatives of the German government or receive representatives of the press. The Russian side in Berlin believes that Li Weinuofu's passage through Germany was entirely a private trip. (Havas Dispatch, 7th) Germany's Policy Toward Russia Remains Unchanged (Berlin) The "People's Observer" published an essay by Rosenberg, a confidant of Prime Minister Hitler, discussing Russian-German relations, stating that although there is a struggle against communism within Germany, Germany's policy toward the Soviet Union will not change because of this. If it is thought that National Socialism determines its foreign policy because of the differences in political principles between Russia and Germany, then this is a great misunderstanding. We hope that the Soviet government will also adopt this position. It also stated that Germany will never interfere in Russia's internal affairs. (Havas Dispatch, 7th) Russia and Austria Once Held Talks Vienna The "Extra" newspaper claims to have reliable news that Soviet Foreign Commissar Li Weinuofu, while in Rome, had a lengthy conversation with the Austrian envoy to Italy. What its purpose was and what the result was, both sides are extremely tight-lipped, but political figures here believe that this conversation seems to be a prelude to Li's upcoming visit to Vienna. (Havas Dispatch, 6th) Italy's Non-Aggression Pact with Russia is Expected to be Approved this Month Rome A communique was issued here this afternoon, describing the results of the talks between Italian Prime Minister Mussolini and Soviet Russian Foreign Commissar Li Weinuofu earlier this week, stating that after Li's visit to Rome, both sides have decided that the Italian-Russian non-aggression pact signed on September 2 will be approved this month, and the credit and export agreement signed on May 6 will also be extended to December 31, 1934. (National Telegram, 6th) Anglo-Russian Commercial Negotiations Progress (London) Overseas Trade Minister Colville stated in the House of Commons today that trade negotiations between Britain and Soviet Russia have made great progress. This negotiation is of great importance to trade, and we cannot but seek a satisfactory result. Lansbury, the leader of the opposition, said that the reason why the Anglo-Russian negotiations have not been resolved immediately is that the issue of compensation for the owners of the Tsarist mines has not yet been resolved, so this matter should not be included in the discussion. Colville replied that Trade Minister Runciman will soon make a statement on this matter. (Reuters Dispatch, 6th) French Foreign Minister Receives Russian Ambassador (Paris) Foreign Minister Peng Gu this afternoon received Soviet Ambassador Tao Fojialeski. (Havas Dispatch, 6th) Rumor that Germany Formally Proposed Direct Disarmament Negotiations to France, But Paris Claims to Have Heard Nothing. Hitler Expressed Willingness to Compromise with France to the British Ambassador (Paris) It is heard that a formal proposal for direct Franco-German negotiations on disarmament was sent from Berlin to the French Foreign Ministry last night. It is expected that the Berlin proposal must have some solid basis, hoping to provide a basis for discussion. (National Telegram, 7th) (Paris) According to foreign news, the German government formally submitted a proposal to the French Foreign Ministry yesterday afternoon to negotiate with France, but those in charge said they were unaware of this matter. It is generally believed that the foreign news is unfounded. According to reports from London yesterday, the British ambassador to Germany met with German Prime Minister Hitler, who again expressed his desire to compromise with France, saying that Germany is now awaiting a response from Paris. The foreign claim that Germany has formally proposed to the French Foreign Ministry may have originated from this. (Havas Dispatch, 7th) (Paris) It is widely believed that France is determined to consult with its allies first, and to begin negotiations with Germany after Czech Foreign Minister Benes arrives in Paris on December 14. The Czech Foreign Minister is the reporter of the Disarmament Continuation Committee and will officially visit Paris on the 14th. The talk between the British Ambassador to Germany and German Prime Minister Hitler on December 5 is seen here as London's hope to see France and Germany directly conclude a disarmament agreement, even if it means that Germany re-arms and France reduces its forces. The "Petit Parisien" newspaper stated that France must first obtain the same opinions from Britain and France, and the British government's guarantee to cooperate with France, otherwise, starting Franco-German talks rashly would be a risk. (Reuters Dispatch, 7th) (London) It is confirmed here that the British Ambassador to Germany was received by German Prime Minister Hitler last night. Hitler again expressed to him his desire to compromise with France, saying that Germany is now awaiting a response from Paris. Regarding this matter, we can declare that the British government has always closely observed Franco-German relations. The reason why it has not temporarily participated recently may be intentional to take this attitude, so that public opinion can shift from the disarmament issue to the issue of partial rearmament. Britain intends to increase German armaments in quantity while reducing French armaments, so that the principle of equality of armaments can be immediately implemented. This intention was vaguely mentioned by Lord Privy Seal Baldwin on November 29 this year, but the government has not publicly advocated it. Or perhaps the British authorities believe that there is no better way to win Germany back to participate in the Disarmament Conference. MacDonald has never given up the intention of winning Germany back. However, the movement to reform the League of Nations by Italy and Germany has made people here very uneasy. As for whether this uneasiness is powerful enough to stop the reform movement, it is difficult to say at this time. The British government believes that there are too many international disputes, so it is appropriate to handle the urgent ones in advance. Britain therefore hopes that Franco-German negotiations will first resolve the disarmament issue without being entangled in political issues. Also, the claims of former Hungarian Prime Minister Count Bethlen in London to revise the Treaty of Trianon for peace with Hungary, although widely publicized, are still viewed coldly by political figures. The reason for this is also to avoid the international problems from becoming complicated. (Havas Dispatch, 6th) French Chamber of Deputies Foreign Affairs Committee Discusses the Saar Issue (Paris) Deputy Freib reported to the Foreign Affairs Committee on the Saar region issue and made a summary today. The main points are: (1) France should not negotiate directly with Germany on the Saar issue; (2) The 1935 plebiscite should be held in accordance with the provisions of the Treaty of Versailles; (3) Protect the people of the Saar from acts of violence (4) Ensure that the plebiscite is free, secret, and safe. Subsequently, the reporter briefly explained the repercussions that the above conclusions could cause in the French provinces of Alsace and Lorraine (which belonged to Germany before the war and now belong to France), Germany, and the countries of the Little Entente. A discussion was then held, with right-wing Deputy Ibargary and several deputies expressing the opinion that France's position in Geneva was quite favorable in the past, but since several months ago, the League of Nations' power has been lost in spirit, and since Germany withdrew from the League of Nations, negotiations within the scope of the League of Nations seem impossible. Ibargary went on to attack the Four-Power Pact, and then the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, former Prime Minister Herriot, took the opportunity to re-explain his reservations about this treaty. Finally, Ibargary advocated: (1) Direct negotiations with Germany, but the French representative should be a person of well-known prestige and backed by a coalition government of all parties; (2) The power of the French army should be restored; (3) Regarding the direct negotiations with Germany, which could make the countries of the Little Entente suspicious, France should especially contact Poland to make the relations between the two countries closer. Ibargary also explained that the German government often makes promises of peace, but the facts often deny them afterward, so they should not be trusted too much. In conclusion, Ibargary said that the League of Nations cannot be ignored. (Havas Dispatch, 6th) The New International Situation Germany's Diplomatic Situation is Surrounded on All Sides. Will it Ally with Japan to Resist Russia? The "China Mail" military correspondent reported from London on November 1 that Germany's liberation movement has entered another period. It is now in an isolated position in Europe, and its activities for equality of armaments have aroused the hostility of three parties. France and Russia have established an understanding, and France, Poland, and the Czech Republic are assuming the responsibility of monitoring the German arms activities on behalf of the League of Nations. Britain, France, and the United States have jointly warned Germany against rearming. As a result, the Germans are now almost surrounded on all sides. However, Prime Minister Hitler is still unwilling to give up his illusion of a new Teutonic empire, hoping that Italy will come to his aid, hoping that Italy will compose harmonious verses in the movement to revive the Roman Empire. The Germans have closely watched the course of the conflict between Japan and China and Russia, and have seen the Japanese obtain freedom of action and its purpose of withdrawing from the League of Nations. Therefore, Hitler, who is good at copying, imitated Mussolini's fascism and followed Japan's withdrawal from the League of Nations. This move has made it possible for German political opinions to establish some understanding with Japan. Moreover, these two isolated countries are separated by the vast territory of Soviet Russia, one in the west of Soviet Russia and one in the strategy of Soviet Russia. Germany and Russia have conflicting political views, and Japan also wants to reserve the Asian continent for its descendants to colonize. These two countries have common goals. Once Soviet Russia has an aggressive action towards any border, it is easy to establish a mutual assistance agreement. According to the current situation, Japan will gain more benefits than Germany after the two countries join hands, but this may not always be the case in the future. In short, Germany, Japan, and Russia are now all outside the League of Nations, and their future relationship will be an aspect that will be increasingly noticed by world diplomats. Furthermore, because the United States, another country that has not joined the League of Nations, has established a political understanding with Soviet Russia, the situation has become more complicated, because the United States certainly does not want Japan to gain an ally in Europe. If the Germans can establish a two-power pact with Japan, or even a three-power pact with Japan and Italy, they will be able to lead the non-member countries to confront the member countries of the League of Nations, and they will search for members who are dissatisfied with the League of Nations and countries that owe excessive membership fees and are unable to pay them to help each other. The goal of the Germans is to unite the Teutonic nation-states and establish a powerful and well-armed group, whose tentacles will reach Eastern Europe, and the current policy is advancing rapidly towards this goal. Therefore, Hitler once personally declared that our future lies in the East. Although he has not been able to achieve this as Hitler hoped, and Italy has given him a fascist coordination, Hitler has no doubt that he will be able to obtain Italian support, so that Germany has sufficient power to obtain a diplomatic agreement, it can be asserted. At that time, Soviet Russia will be a threat to its future, and the Germans hope to join hands with the Japanese in this regard. Moreover, it is also very beneficial for Japan to obtain assistance on the Soviet-Russian European front to ease the tension on the Manchurian border. Now that Russia and France have an agreement, the establishment of an understanding between Germany and Japan is likely to be closer. The British Port Construction Project in Singapore Can Be Completed in Six Years (London) Navy Minister Monsell stated in the House of Commons today that if necessary funds are available, the construction of the naval base in Singapore is expected to be completed by the end of 1939. (Reuters Dispatch, 6th) The Mexican Proposal at the Pan-American Conference is Shelved, Due to Opposition from the United States Montevideo Today's meeting of the Pan-American Conference Subcommittee resolved to transfer the Mexican currency proposal to the Inter-American High Commission in Washington for handling, without formally voting on it at this conference. This immediately aroused the opposition of the Mexican representative. The Mexican Foreign Minister accused the United States of keeping its policies secret and strongly criticized secret meetings, insisting that such events must be discussed publicly. This subcommittee was established yesterday to study the Mexican proposal. The Mexicans advocated establishing a bimetallic system and temporarily suspending the payment of Inter-American debts for six years. When the subcommittee voted, the United States opposed this proposal, and Argentina and Brazil echoed it. Therefore, the majority advocated transferring it to the Inter-American Commission. The US Ambassador to Uruguay spoke on behalf of the US delegation, strongly stating that the United States is not afraid of publicizing, but wants to discuss it publicly. The main committee today elected two more subcommittees, and is now requesting international representatives to send an observer to the meeting to assist in finding a solution to the dispute between Bolivia and Paraguay over the Chaco.

<p>The US Treasury Department Splits Again, and Internal Strife Also Occurs in the Department of Agriculture (Washington) Personnel in the Treasury Department are now in conflict again. On behalf of Secretary of the Treasury Morgenthau, today removed Under Secretary of the Treasury Hsu Shih's authority to manage the Internal Revenue Service. If President Roosevelt does not intervene to mediate, then many expect Hsu Shih to resign. (Reuters Dispatch, 6th) (New York) The internal strife in the Department of Agriculture, the fierce attacks by former Secretary of the Treasury Mills on President Roosevelt's monetary policy, and the split among Treasury Department personnel are the most recent developments in the American political situation. Director of the Farm Land Administration Peek has issued a letter of mourning to Secretary of Agriculture Wallace, demanding the dismissal of certain advisors, otherwise he will resign. Peek later met with President Roosevelt. It is heard that Peek and advisors Tugwell and Frank disagreed on certain industry regulations. It was learned tonight that various industry regulations for recovery, including agriculture, must be handed over to General Johnson for handling. Former Secretary of the Treasury Mills stated that prices are bound to gradually recover after being at a very low level. The rise in domestic prices has not been higher than it should have been after prices were extremely low. The value of the dollar has been reduced, and government debts have not been fulfilled, but their impact on domestic prices is minimal. It is now urgent to restore the gold standard, because the world needs a stable medium of exchange, and because fundamental forces are now moving towards recovery. (Reuters Dispatch, 7th) (New York) The main point of the dispute in the Department of Agriculture is whether the Farm Village Administration should remain part of the Department of Agriculture under the leadership of Wallace, or become an independent agency with Peek, a close friend of General Johnson, as its director. President Roosevelt's move to hand over all kinds of industry regulations for recovery to General Johnson for handling is seen by many as Peek's victory. However, whether this kind of mediation can quell the split will depend on Secretary of Agriculture Wallace's attitude in the future. (Reuters Dispatch, 7th) The US Government Organizes an Emergency Committee and Issues New Bonds for 95 Million (Washington) The US President announced today the organization of the National Emergency Committee, so that it can organize the details of the government's recovery plan and make overall adjustments. Walker will temporarily serve as the director. The committee will establish agencies throughout the country in order to facilitate recovery work and enable the central government and local people to have closer contact. The committee can also assist the existing recovery agencies to plan out the detailed programs that the current agencies are busy dealing with one by one, so that the recovery business can proceed quickly, and it is hoped that the government affairs of other agencies can also be coordinated as a whole, so as to avoid the drawbacks of disorder. In addition, assisting in mediating disputes between the various recovery agencies is also one of the main tasks of the committee. (National Telegram, 6th) (Washington) The US government today issued new bonds for $950,000,000, due in mid-December next year with an annual interest rate of 2.5%. In addition to repaying the bonds due on the 15th of this month, these bonds can also have a surplus of $100,000,000 for public use. This time the interest rate is higher, and some people think that this is due to the recent weakness of the government bond market and the uncertainty of the currency trend. (National Telegram, 6th) (Washington) Acting Secretary of the Treasury Morgenthau announced today that the Treasury Department has repaid more than $900,000,000 of the $1,874,000,000 in the Fourth Liberty Loan. This move can save the government $10 million in interest each year. According to the Treasury Department, the Financial Reconstruction Corporation's purchase price for newly mined domestic gold will remain temporarily unchanged, in order to stabilize the government bond market and prepare to issue new debt to repay old debt in mid-December. (National Telegram, 6th) Hirota's Economic Aggression Policy Divides Large Markets with Other Countries and Concentrates All Efforts on Occupying Small Markets, Controlling Exports to Avoid Malpractices (Tokyo) Japan's countermeasures against the British and European countries' oppression of Japanese trade have been under study by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' review committee. The new economic diplomacy policy embraced by Foreign Minister Hirota is: (1) Strengthening export control; (2) Retaliatory facilities such as composite tariffs; (3) Industrial policy and trade policy are mutually consistent, and reciprocity and small market principles are the principles for foreign countries. Its implementation methods are: (1) Advocate holding international trade conferences in major countries to maintain the status quo of reciprocal relations, adjust trade with countries, and at the same time advocate opening the doors to new markets; (2) Suggest that countries that oppress Japanese trade should resolve it through bilateral consultation in advance; (3) Regarding large regional markets, in order to maintain the balance of power in trade, propose a consultation agreement to prevent the evils of competition; (4) Concentrate all efforts in small market countries in South America, the Near East, Africa, etc., to introduce and promote Japanese goods, and strive to avoid the bad name of being rough and shoddy, and gain fixed customers. (Den Tsū, 7th) (Tokyo) In order to control export trade, the Ministry of Commerce and Industry has decided to establish a control policy for trade with various countries based on the export control of export associations, and is now drafting relevant laws and regulations, which are scheduled to be submitted to the next session of the parliament to establish export associations and industrial associations that cover the operators and force them to join, and establish price control and quantity control to mitigate the malpractice of dumping. (Den Tsū, 7th) Hirota Explains the Diplomatic Situation to the House of Peers, Augmenting Military Preparations in the Heilongjiang Area (Tokyo) Foreign Minister Hirota attended a discussion meeting on the China issue held by representatives of various factions of the House of Peers on the 6th and explained the diplomatic situation. The content is as follows: (1) Japan's policy towards China is to make "Manchukuo" prosper and carry out diplomatic work; (2) The Fujian provincial independent government has the participation of various groups such as the pro-faction and the anti-central faction, but whether it can establish a completely independent government is still questionable; (3) Japan still hopes that the issue of purchasing the Chinese Eastern Railway will be established and will not refuse to assist its work; (4) There have been various statements about Japan-Russia relations recently, but based on the current situation in Russia, Soviet Russia will not actively challenge Japan. Regardless of the attitude of other countries, it is necessary for Japan to augment military preparations in the Heilongjiang area. (Nichi-Ren, 7th) (Tokyo) Foreign Minister Hirota answered the following questions at the China Discussion Meeting of the House of Peers at the Research Institute at 2 p.m. yesterday: I believe that in the current urgent international relations, in order to improve relations with Russia and the United States, emphasizing diplomacy with China is a task that brooks no delay. Regarding the diplomatic policy towards China, according to the conclusion of the five-minister conference, we will make China understand Japan's position, that is, to seek mutual cooperation in political and economic structures and in ideological aspects. The Fujian government is a mixture of communist factions and opposition factions. Japan is across from Taiwan, and its future development must be paid special attention to. Regarding diplomacy with Russia, according to my experience, I firmly believe that it is possible to improve Japan-Russia relations by diplomatic means, so I am determined to make even more efforts. Regarding the issue of purchasing the Eastern Railway, I sincerely hope that Russia and Manchuria will abandon their past feelings and conduct negotiations satisfactorily. However, whether it can be achieved depends on the sincerity of Soviet Russia. The sound development of "Manchukuo" is beneficial to the increase of world welfare, and it is intended to help its development as the basic policy of diplomacy. The attendees all supported the Foreign Minister's policy and urged him to move forward bravely, and said many encouraging words.

(Reuters Dispatch, 6th) Japan Will Yield to India (Tokyo) Whether the Japanese side will approve India's proposal will be decided today by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, and the operators at a joint public-private conference. However, the intention of the officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Commerce and Industry is that, even though India, etc., has made extremely unfavorable requests to Japan regarding the ratio of sun-dried cotton cloth, we must consider the overall situation of this Japan-India conference and future Japan-India trade opening issues. Some disadvantages sometimes have to be endured. For this reason, the operators' representatives generally tend to approve the Indian case at the public-private agreement meeting on the 7th, and Minister of Commerce Nakajima and Wakamatsu Torao, the commercial secretary of the British Embassy, who is returning to Japan, will go to Osaka to try to persuade the sun-dried cotton cloth-related operators. The government's final policy on the Indian case will be officially decided at the cabinet meeting on the 12th, and a reply to Representative Sawada will also be sent at that time.

He also said that the austerity policy will continue tonight to maintain the Franc. The government admits that the budget is short 600 million Francs, but the actual shortage is even greater than this.

One unexpected feature of the celebration of lifting the ban is that there is very little drunkenness in the 18 states where the sale of alcohol is now permitted. New York held celebrations all night long, and no drunkards were seen on the road. This is truly a miracle. It goes without saying that restaurants and hotels that sell alcohol are three times more profitable. Brewers and importers are now subject to the restrictions of industry regulations. The authorities are trying to prevent private sales. At the same time, the US government is continuing to negotiate a business agreement with other countries, wanting to exchange the import of alcoholic beverages for the export of surplus American agricultural products.

In Champagne-Ardenne, France, a giant paper figure was made to represent Prohibition and burned in public for joy. (National Telegram, 6th) No Progress in British-Irish Relations Dublin As a result of the exchange of documents between de Valera and British Dominions Minister Thomas, there has been no progress in peacefully resolving the issue. Therefore, people in the South Irish Free State are quite disappointed. It is widely believed that if de Valera wants to maintain his position, he must find a way to rebuild South Ireland into a republic, because he has always used this as a slogan. However, those who are concerned about the current situation all believe that if there is no progress in the current unstable economic situation, Ireland will experience a financial panic or create an even worse situation. The South Irish government's newspaper "The Irish News" stated that the former relations between Britain and Ireland should be corrected as soon as possible, otherwise, it will be difficult for both sides to cooperate on an equal footing. The newspaper also denied that South Ireland will hold a general election.

In terms of increasing revenue, the tax rate on cigarettes, matches, and cement has been increased, and collection has begun. In addition, there are inheritance tax, luxury tax, etc., which are being planned to be collected and are expected to be realized next year. As for reducing expenditure, after detailed consideration with the central authorities, because the operating expenses of various agencies have been reduced to the point where they cannot be reduced any further, they can only be maintained as they are without increasing them, so as not to affect the administration. However, during the national crisis, civil servants should be frugal and bear heavy burdens, and endure pain for the country. Therefore, it is proposed to continue to implement the austerity measures of September 18.

<p>The Russian Ambassador Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday Morning; Met with U.S. Minister to China, Johnson; The First Conversation After the Resumption of Diplomatic Relations Between the U.S. and Russia. Soviet Russian Ambassador to China, Bogomolov, left Peiping some time ago for Nanjing on official business and entered Beijing.

However, Minister Johnson had already left Shanghai the night before for Beijing. Therefore, Bogomolov intends to return to Beijing as soon as possible in the next day or two so that he can meet with Minister Johnson in Beijing.</p>
<p>The First Batch of American Wheat is About to Arrive; At the Latest, it Will Arrive on Monday. Our country ordered American cotton and wheat with a loan of a total of 50 million U.S. dollars, of which cotton accounts for 40 million U.S. dollars and wheat accounts for 10 million U.S. dollars. To ship all of it to Shanghai, at least 200 ocean-going vessels of 10,000 tons each are needed. Initially, American shipping companies competed to undertake the transportation, with the Fook Lai Company making particularly great efforts. Later, the Chinese government decided to assign all cotton and wheat transportation rights to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. He Molin went to the United States to handle the chartering of ships. The American authorities and China agreed that since the right to charter ships for cotton and wheat transportation is handled by Chinese merchants themselves, then half of all the cotton and wheat must be transported by American ships, and ships of any other nationality can be chartered to transport the remainder.</p>
<p>The First Batch Will Arrive Soon. The first batch of American wheat shipped from Portland, North America, totaling about 80,000 bags, is being transported to China by the empty British merchant ship Benark, chartered by the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. It has now crossed the Pacific Ocean and is expected to arrive in Japan today or tomorrow. According to reliable information received yesterday, it will arrive in Shanghai by Monday (the 11th) at the latest and will be docked at the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Chinese warehouse in Pudong for unloading. All labor costs for stacking in the holds and warehouses will be determined by public bidding, with the lowest bidder winning the contract, which will be decided within one or two days.</p>
<p>The Remaining Shipments Have Also Been Shipped. Reporters also learned that the second batch of American wheat shipped from Portland is being transported by the American States Line's freighter Aralegan, loaded with 80,000 metric tons of wheat (approximately 80,000 several thousand bags). It has already set sail and is en route. According to a telegram received from the ship yesterday, it is expected to arrive in Shanghai on the 23rd of this month and will also be unloaded into the Chinese warehouse. The third batch has also been confirmed to be loaded on the American ship Iowan, carrying 8,000 tons, but it will not arrive in Shanghai until January 16th.</p>
<p>American Cotton Imports. The American cotton being shipped to Shanghai is now being handled by the American Cotton Trade Company in consultation with various shipping companies, changing to shipping in batches successively to Shanghai. The British company Jardine Matheson has shipped several batches, each time with 1,000 to 2,000 bales. Yesterday, the Tianxiang Company's ship Fort Point also shipped 1,000 bales, temporarily unloaded at the Qichang Warehouse. In addition, the British ship Hanchow, specially transporting American cotton, has already loaded 4,900 bales to Shanghai. According to a telegram received yesterday, it is expected to arrive in Shanghai on the 13th for unloading.</p>
<p>Shipping Contract. A total of 3 to 4 million bales of American cotton will be shipped here. Although all these goods will be unloaded in Shanghai and stored in the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Yangzi Litoo Warehouse, a considerable portion will also be transshipped to various places. The American Cotton Trade Company stationed in Shanghai has reached an agreement with the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company on the domestic transshipment contract for American cotton. All American cotton arriving in Shanghai that is to be sent to other ports, whether in the Yangtze River or in the Northern or Southern Seas, will be undertaken by the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. In the event of special circumstances where the company has no ships available for transportation, it may change to loading on ships of other companies to facilitate transportation. The contract has been signed by both parties.</p>
<p>Yang Shuzhuang Went to Beijing Last Night; To Attend an Important Central Meeting This Morning; To Discuss the Handling of the Fujian Incident. Mr. Yang Shuzhuang, former chairman of Fujian Province and member of the Central Executive Committee, previously went to Jiangxi with Fang Shengtao to meet with Jiang, making proposals on handling the political changes in Fujian Province. He then returned to Shanghai. A reporter from the Ri Ri News Agency made a special visit to Mr. Yang's private residence yesterday to inquire about the aforementioned situation. According to him, the Central Government has always been lenient towards the rebellion in Fujian Province. At present, it is making every effort to avoid military action and is attempting to make a final disposition through political means. The Central Political Council will convene a temporary meeting this morning (i.e., this morning) to further discuss the Fujian issue. I will take the night express train to Beijing tonight (i.e., last night) to attend. The prospect of resolving the Fujian Incident is expected to be optimistic, etc.</p>
<p>The Governor of Hawaii's Wife Will Leave Shanghai Tomorrow; Via Manila, Returning to Honolulu. The Governor of the Hawaiian Islands and his wife, along with their three sons and daughters, arrived at Qinhuangdao on the American warship Chaumont on the 25th of last month and landed to tour Peiping. They arrived in Shanghai by train from Peiping the day before yesterday and stayed at the Cathay Hotel on the Bund. Yu Ming, the director of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Shanghai office, grew up in Honolulu and had friendships with the Governor and his wife. Therefore, he specially hosted a banquet at the Xing Hua Lou restaurant on Fourth Avenue the night before last to welcome the Governor's wife. Wu Jingxiong, Zhao Tieqiao, and others were invited to accompany them. After the banquet, they went to the Tianchan Theater to watch Cheng Yanqiu's "Ban Ma Ji". The Governor's wife has already decided to take the same warship tomorrow, via Manila, to return to Honolulu.</p>
<p>German Police Expert Hired to Come to China; Mr. Gelsinski. According to sources from foreigners in this city, the Ministry of Interior of our country passed a resolution to reorganize the police system in various parts of the country at the Second National Interior Conference. It immediately hired Gelsinski, the former Berlin police chief, as a consultant from Germany. Gelsinski set off from Germany via France at the beginning of the month to come to China. Several police experts also came to China with Gelsinski.</p>
<p>Shanghai-Guangdong Flights Delayed Due to Fog; Stopped in Shantou Yesterday, Expected to Arrive Today; Southbound Flight Tomorrow Morning, Back to Normal Next Week; Popular Flight Reports, Booming Freight. The schedule for the China National Aviation Corporation's Shanghai-Guangdong line was originally set for southbound flights to Guangzhou every Tuesday and Friday, and northbound flights to Shanghai every Thursday and Saturday. However, since the southbound plane crashed in Zhoushan on the 24th of last month, there is currently only one Sikorsky aircraft flying this route. If the weather is unfavorable, the flight must be delayed. Yesterday was Thursday, the date the plane was scheduled to arrive in Shanghai. However, it was blocked by heavy fog after arriving in Shantou. For the sake of passenger safety, it had to stop in Shantou overnight. If the weather does not change today, it can arrive in Shanghai around 3:00 PM this afternoon. This flight will be changed to a southbound flight tomorrow, Saturday, and will return to Shanghai next Monday. The original schedule will be restored on Tuesday. There will be no more flight delays after the new aircraft arrives in January next year. In addition, since sea transportation between Shanghai and Fujian was cut off after the Fujian Incident, airplanes can still land as usual. Therefore, the number of goods delivered to Fujian through the Shanghai Aviation News Agency's agency at Nos. 123 Xin Yi Er San, Shandong Road, in this city, is extremely crowded. The air freight to Fuzhou is still 65 cents per pound, to Xiamen 88 cents, to Shantou one dollar, and to Guangzhou one dollar and thirty-five cents. It is also heard that many people are subscribing to newspapers from the agency to be sent to various ports of call because the agency can send all the major Chinese and Western newspapers in Shanghai to various ports on the same day, and the prices are very low.</p>
<p>Increased Aircraft Imports Amidst the Call to Save the Nation Through Aviation; From January to August of this Year; Reached Over 8 Million US Dollars, Ranking First. Since the September 18th and January 28th Incidents, people in our country, both in the government and among the general public, have seen the power of the enemy's air force and believe that developing the aviation industry is an urgent matter. Therefore, the call to save the nation through aviation has spread throughout the country. However, because our country lacks aviation personnel and manufacturing materials, adding aircraft must rely on foreign countries. Therefore, various countries, including the United Kingdom and the United States, are taking advantage of our country's eagerness to catch up and are sending large numbers of propagandists to China, stationed in various ports to promote sales, and competing fiercely with each other. According to the Shanghai Customs investigation, from January to August of this year, the total value of aircraft and accessories exported to China by various countries reached more than 8.102 million yuan, an increase of more than six times compared with aircraft imports from various countries in 1932. The statistics are as follows: (United States) 5.634 million yuan, (United Kingdom) 353,000 yuan, (Germany) 364,000 yuan, (France) 72,000 yuan, others 1.679 million yuan, totaling 8.102 million yuan. It is also learned that last year, American aircraft exports to China were only 371,000 yuan, but now they have increased to 5.634 million yuan. As for the United Kingdom, they have decreased from 456,000 yuan to 353,000 yuan. The United States accounts for 70% of the total, ranking first. In order to catch up with the United States, the British authorities plan to send an air attaché to be stationed in Shanghai to promote their products.</p>
<p>Regulations on Reducing Telegraph Fees Starting Next Year's New Year's Day; Recipient's Name and Address Counted as Five Characters; Telegrams Are Charged Double the Regular Fee. According to the Shanghai Wireless Telegraph General Station at Lao Bei Men in this city, the Ministry of Transportation has specially stipulated five measures to reduce fees for the recipient's name and address in domestic Chinese telegrams, in order to facilitate communication for the public. They will be implemented starting January 1 next year. The measures are as follows: (1) The recipient's place name and the recipient's name and address in this type of telegram, if not exceeding fifteen characters, will all be charged as five characters.

<p>Decline of Chinese Silk Sales to the United States; Four Reasons That Silk Factories Should Pay Attention To. The sales of Chinese silk to the United States have been declining year by year. The reasons for the decline, according to the International Trade Bureau yesterday, are: 1. Poor quality, too many breaks; 2. Poor sales promotion, declining sales; 3. Lack of spot goods in the United States to allow American factories to choose and pick up goods at any time for occasional use; 4. Chinese silk prices are higher than Japanese silk due to cost factors. Therefore, sales have been declining due to these four reasons. It is hoped that domestic silk factories will pay attention to improving the quality of silk in order to maintain the previous state of Chinese silk trade in the United States.</p>
<p>No Improvement in Silk Prices; Silk Factories in Jiangsu and Zhejiang Have Almost Ceased Operations; Only One-Tenth Are Barely Operating; Appealing to the Economic Committee This Morning. In the spring of 1930, there were 106 single-reeling silk factories in Shanghai, seven double-reeling factories, 48 in Wuxi, five in Suzhou and Zhenjiang, and 26 in Hangzhou, Huzhou, Jiaxing, Xiaoshan, etc., totaling 186 factories with more than 45,800 reeling machines. Recently, due to the continuous decline in the European and American silk markets, silk merchants have suffered heavy losses and have successively ceased operations to wait for an opportunity. Currently, less than 20 silk factories in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces are barely maintaining operations. In order to fundamentally save the silk industry, trade associations in various places have decided to send representatives Shen Huachen, Chu Huiseng, Cheng Bingming, Qian Fenghao, Jiang Laixian, Chen Zezhong, Sun Rongchang, Zhang Yunsheng, etc., to the National Economic Committee at 10:00 AM today to meet with Standing Committee member Song Ziwen, requesting the prompt establishment of a silk industry control council to stabilize silk prices and thereby rescue the industry.</p>
<p>The Yarn Manufacturers Association Requests the Suppression of the Actions of Workers at the Yufeng Yarn Factory in Henan. Regarding the case of workers at the Yufeng Yarn Factory in Zhengzhou arbitrarily taking cotton yarn, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and the Banking Association, etc., believe that such actions by workers infringe on the legal interests of bank mortgages and have sent telegrams urging suppression. The Chinese Cotton Mill Owners Association also sent telegrams yesterday to Chiang Kai-shek in Nanchang, Chairman Liu in Kaifeng, the Central Party Headquarters in Nanjing, the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Finance, and the Ministry of Industry, stating: According to a letter from the Yufeng Yarn Factory in Zhengzhou, a member of the association, "Our factory has declared bankruptcy due to poor business operations. A small number of unscrupulous workers, under the guise of the entire workforce, have started disputes. On the 3rd of this month, workers, in the presence of representatives from the mediation committee and government officials, destroyed the door locks of our factory warehouse and arbitrarily took away 369 bales of cotton yarn, valued at more than 70,000 yuan. This cotton yarn is a mortgage held by the bank and is not the property of our factory. Such illegal actions by these workers not only damage the operational safety of inland yarn factories but also undermine the security of the banking industry's investments in inland yarn factories," etc. It is our opinion that the Yufeng Yarn Factory's poor business operations, making it impossible to maintain operations, have ultimately not been understood by the workers, who, in the presence of government officials, destroyed the factory doors and arbitrarily took the cotton yarn. If such actions are not strictly suppressed, the entire national industry will lose its security. Therefore, we respectfully request that you immediately order the local government to promptly suppress the actions of the workers at the Yufeng Yarn Factory and immediately return all the cotton yarn taken in order to protect the factory and maintain the rule of law. We are extremely eager to see this happen. The Chinese Cotton Mill Owners Association respectfully submits this message.</p>
<p>The Czech Consul Sends a Letter to the City Chamber of Commerce to Investigate Counterfeit Czech Tiles; The City Chamber of Commerce Cannot Find Anything. The Consul of Czechoslovakia stationed in Shanghai stated that recently, a type of tile has been found on the market with the words "Product of Czechoslovakia." The Consul has learned that these tiles are not products of the Czech Republic. Obviously, merchants from other countries are using the name "Czech Tiles" (Czekhos Lovailia) to deceive customers. Furthermore, judging from the words "Roka" on the tiles, it can be seen that they intentionally imitate the Rako trademark used on genuine Czech tiles produced by the Rakovnikanci Postorna Coramik Works factory. The Consul specially sent a letter to the Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce, requesting assistance in the investigation. The City Chamber of Commerce immediately sent personnel to inquire from various parties. They all stated that there are many types of tiles, with different brands. Most of the products sold in this city are products of Germany and Japan. Czech tiles are rarely seen. Judging from the samples, it seems to be a counterfeit product from a certain country, as its color is white and not much different from the high-quality tiles of a certain country. However, the business address of the merchant cannot be found. A reply has been sent to the Consul stating that he should inquire with the Jianghai Customs.</p>
<p>After the Tobacco Industry Complied with the Order to Increase Taxes, Representatives Were Sent to the Tax Office Yesterday to Report; The Ministry of Finance Strictly Prohibits Counterfeiting and Tax Evasion and Permits Price Increases. After the tobacco manufacturers decided at a meeting the day before yesterday to comply with the new consolidated tax of the Ministry of Finance and affix stamps according to regulations, and requested the government to appropriate a portion of the increased new tax to subsidize the development of the manufacturers' business, they sent Wu Tingsheng, Bao Gengsheng, Shen Weiting, and others to report to the tax office. Due to time constraints, the three representatives went again yesterday to make a request. Acting Director Wang Daoyuan and Secretary Dong Zhongding received them and promised to forward the plan to the director and report it to the Ministry of Finance for consideration and decision. They also promised to strictly prohibit tax evasion.</p>
<p>The Chinese Tobacco Manufacturers Association yesterday notified all manufacturers that they must not engage in smuggling and tax evasion. It stated, "To whom it may concern, we have received a letter from the Tax Office of the Ministry of Finance, stating that the Ministry of Finance issued Instruction Hu No. 2, which stated, 'The obligation of merchants and citizens to bear taxes is inherent, and the government should also fulfill its responsibility to protect them. For goods with relatively high tax rates, there will inevitably be more smuggling. Tobacco is a luxury item, and in all countries, except for those with monopolies, its tax rate is always several times higher than its price, which is intended to discourage consumption through taxation. This time, the government, due to insufficient national treasury funds, is trying to make up for it by slightly increasing taxes. All merchants, out of love for the country, will certainly be able to comply and implement it. In order to show consideration for the difficulties of merchants and maintain legitimate merchants, we must strictly investigate and deal with smuggling and tax evasion, as well as those who counterfeit trademarks. We have heard that unscrupulous officials in various districts have often condoned dishonest merchants and arbitrarily indulged them, while legitimate merchants have no way to protect themselves, which hinders both national taxes and commerce. Therefore, we order the office to strictly investigate and not condone any violations. This is of utmost importance. We have sent this order to all bureaus and offices to strictly prohibit counterfeit and tax-evading cigarettes, and we are also sending this letter to you for your information.' In view of this, we have recorded the letter and forwarded it to you. We hope that you will take note of it. Do not lower prices."</p>
<p>The Tax Office of the Ministry of Finance sent a letter to the Chinese Tobacco Manufacturers Association yesterday, stating that it is not allowed to take the opportunity to lower prices for dumping. The letter stated that the Ministry of Finance issued Instruction Hu No. 3, which stated, "The consolidated tobacco tax is an indirect tax. When the government increases taxes, merchants can originally increase prices for sale. Tobacco is a useless luxury item and is not essential for the people's lives. Higher prices can discourage consumption through taxation. At this time, unscrupulous merchants who seek petty gains may lower prices for dumping in an attempt to suppress their competitors and manipulate the market, which violates the government's principle of protecting commerce. Therefore, we order the office to notify all tobacco merchants and companies that they should be allowed to add the increased taxes to the price of cigarettes for sale. If anyone intends to engage in dumping to undermine their competitors, the office will strictly suppress them so that they know the government's intention to protect commerce. Do not bring trouble upon yourselves. This is of utmost importance. We have sent this order to all district bureaus and offices to strictly suppress violations, and we are also sending this letter to your association for your information. We hope that you will also inform all tobacco factories to comply."</p>
<p>Small Shops Seek Help. The various tobacco exchange shops in this city consider cigarettes and matches to be daily necessities for sale, and the relationship between profit and loss is not shallow. Large tobacco factories and companies with strong capital, as well as the managers of various shops, all have old tax inventory. There will be no damage to wholesale distribution or retail sales. Small retail shops have no partnerships with companies and cannot directly ship goods. The goods sold daily are purchased and sold with each shipment, because they have no ability to purchase and store inventory. Before the implementation of the increased consolidated tax, wholesale shops were already selling at the new tax price, so the profit was not shallow. If they sell at the old price, they will not suffer losses either. Small retail shops have been requesting the association to find ways to remedy this for days. The association then publicly appointed Chen Liangyu, Chai Yasheng, Chen Kunxian, Zhang Songji, and others yesterday to request various companies to supply each small shop with a certain amount of cigarettes at the original price to compensate for the loss of the added tax, connect feelings, promote domestic goods, and scheduled a general membership meeting on the 10th of this month to discuss various important matters to be carried out.</p>
<p>Cargo Congestion at the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Water and Land Joint Transportation Office. After the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company opened the water and land joint transportation route for the Longhai Railway's Lao Yao Ban, cargo from the Northwest is extremely congested. The Tonghua and Yushun ships are fully loaded each time they come to Shanghai. Starting this month, Haiqing Yilu will also be added to the route, so the two ships dispatched feel insufficient. The issue of civilian shipping vessels participating still needs to be approved by the Ministry of Transportation and the Ministry of Railways before they can be added, so a meeting must be held to discuss this, and it is difficult to implement for the time being. However, the Dazhen Shipping Company, which sails to Dapu, was contacted by the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company at the beginning of the preparations for joint transportation to take over and use them. After long negotiations, this newspaper also reported on the overview. Now, because the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company needs ocean-going vessels, it is actively carrying out the merger of the Dazhen Company. The two sides have held multiple meetings in recent days and have made progress. The shipping department of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has notified Dazhen to send personnel to the Yongji and Yongping ships of the company to carry out test drives and tests to see if they are suitable. If they are tested and found to be suitable, they will be taken over and dispatched to sail to Haizhou Lao Yao.</p>
<p>The Longhai Railway's Shanghai Joint Transportation Office has agreed with the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to dispatch four marine police officers to board the joint transportation ships coming to Shanghai from Lao Yao to guard against small thieves at the docks sneaking into the ships to steal cargo and prevent accidental losses.</p>
<p>The Shanghai County Government Orders the Subordinates to Urge the Payment of Overdue Land Taxes; Must Be Paid in Full Before the 15th of This Month; Those Who Fail to Pay Will Be Detained Without Leniency. After the Shanghai County issued the methods for urging the payment of overdue land taxes, the amount still owed is huge despite the urging. Recently, the county government has repeatedly received telegrams from the Finance Department urging the delivery of taxes. Therefore, County Magistrate Pan summoned the officials responsible for urging payment in each district yesterday to personally instruct them. The officials all stated that among the landowners, there are always those who intentionally delay payment, and repeated urging is ineffective. Furthermore, some people are manipulating the situation, making it difficult to urge payment. County Magistrate Pan instructed that if there are households who intentionally fail to pay, they should be reported immediately for arrest. They are now ordered to pay in full before the 15th of this month. If they fail to pay again, they will be detained without leniency. The officials all complied with the instructions and withdrew.</p>
<p>The National Goods Movement Exhibition in the Special District; Scheduled to Open on the 15th of This Month. The Chinese National Products Manufacturers Association convened the third general meeting of manufacturer representatives yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM to prepare for the National Goods Movement Exhibition in the Shanghai Special District. More than 100 representatives from more than 80 companies, including Guanshengyuan, Wuhe Weaving Factory, Zhongnan Socks, Guangdong Brothers Rubber Factory, Wusa Soap Factory, and Zhang Xiaoquan Scissors Shop, attended. Liu Zhongying was elected as the chairman, and Zhou Zhaolin was the recorder.

<p>The Procuratorate Restricts Lawyers from Meeting with Defendants; Notice No. 1. In addition to those prohibited from visiting, it has been the practice of the court to allow family members, relatives, or lawyers of detained criminals to visit. Therefore, the detention center has a visitor's register. All lawyers who come to visit first register and can visit at any time, which has been convenient. However, the Shanghai District Court Detention Center issued Notice No. 1 yesterday, which stated: "Regarding the matter of the notice, we have received the first and second instructions from the Chief Prosecutor of the Jiangsu Shanghai District Court, which stated that it has recently been heard that lawyers are meeting with defendants during investigations, which is deeply shocking. The Criminal Procedure Law states that defendants may only appoint lawyers for defense after prosecution, as stated in Article 165. Therefore, it is inappropriate to allow lawyers to meet with defendants during investigations. Therefore, we order the director of the detention center to strictly comply with this order and not allow the above to happen again, lest there be an investigation." Therefore, lawyers who went to visit defendants yesterday as usual were not allowed to visit defendants who had not yet been prosecuted. The director is Wang Tingqi.</p>
<p>Wang Delin's Representative Sends a Letter Requesting Funds to Repatriate Family Members. The Minyan News Agency reports that the family members of Ma Zhanshan, Su Bingwen, Wang Delin, and others, after withdrawing from the Eastern Provinces, detoured to Shanghai. The benevolent groups in this city rented houses to settle them. However, the family members of Ma and Su have been allocated funds to return to their hometowns at different times. Currently, only the family members of Wang's unit remain in Shanghai. Yesterday, Wang Delin's representatives, Liang Yuanshan and Zhang Chuyu, sent a letter to the Joint Association of Benevolent Groups for Relief of Northeastern Refugees, requesting the allocation of travel funds to send Liu Qingfeng, Chen Zhangshi, and nine others back to their hometowns. The original letter is as follows: We respectfully state that nine members of our family, including Liu Qingfeng, voluntarily wish to return to their hometowns to seek a living. However, they have no travel funds. Therefore, we specially request your association to provide travel funds to facilitate their journey. We would be extremely grateful. Respectfully submitted by Liang Yuanshan and Zhang Chuyu, representatives of the Shanghai Office of the Headquarters of the Northeastern Volunteer Army.</p>
<p>Regulations on Guaranteeing the Rights of Employees of the Two Railways; The Revised Draft Has Been Submitted to the Ministry for Approval and Promulgation. The Bureau of the Two Railways previously received an order from the Ministry of Railways to copy the Regulations on Guaranteeing the Rights of Employees of the Two Railways, but the documents were destroyed. It has obtained a copy of the regulations drafted in the 18th year of the Republic from the Special Party Department of the Two Railways. However, after considering the current situation, it is necessary to make changes according to the times. The director of the bureau appointed Yuan Boyang, the deputy director of the General Affairs Department and head of the Personnel Section, to work with the chief auditor stationed on the railway and representatives of the Party Department of the Two Railways to review the original regulations, referring to current laws and regulations. A draft of 12 articles has been carefully revised. The bureau has reviewed the draft and found it to be feasible. It has submitted it to the Ministry of Railways for submission to the Legal Regulations Committee for review, compilation, promulgation, and implementation.</p>

Several methods were decided in Nanjing on the 23rd of last month (see below). It was decided that the President Arthur liner would ship the coffin back to Guangdong on the 9th of this month, and a public memorial service would be held by various circles on the 7th in advance, and many of his posthumous works would be displayed. The spirit hall was set up in the Chinese Funeral Home on that day.

<p>Educational News from Other Locations: Ministry of Education Revises Key Points of the Joint Examination Regulations The Ministry of Education has announced the regulations for joint examinations for primary and secondary schools and issued a circular outlining key points: (1) Primary schools are temporarily exempt from joint examinations; (2) Re-examinations are canceled; (3) The Joint Examination Committee will formulate separate organizational regulations; (4) School grades in each subject will account for 40% of the final joint examination grade; (5) Security measures for exam questions and printing must be strict. Based on interviews, the key points are further explained as follows: (1) Since primary schools are exempt from joint examinations, the regulations are renamed "Joint Examination Regulations for Secondary School Graduates"; (2) Previously, each province and city organized its own examination committee, but now the Ministry of Education has issued the "Regulations for the Joint Examination Committee for Secondary School Graduates," which provinces and cities must follow; (3) Previously, students failing one or two major subjects could not apply to universities, but now they can (students only repeat grades if they fail three subjects), a slightly more lenient restriction; (4) For junior high schools in provinces with vast territories or other special difficulties, the Ministry of Education may approve a sample examination for no more than half of the junior high schools in the province. However, cities directly under the Executive Yuan must still conduct joint examinations for all schools because a single city's area is not too large. Therefore, the request from 13 private schools in Beijing to be exempted from the joint examination has been denied.</p>
<p>Ministry of Education Orders Ban on Examination-Related Books, Citing Speculation and Neglect of Studies, Hindering Graduate Joint Examinations</p>
<p>(Nanjing, December 7) The Ministry of Education issued an order to various departments, stating that since the implementation of graduate joint examinations for primary and secondary school students in various provinces and cities, some bookstores have printed and sold books such as "Essential Readings for Joint Examinations" and "Joint Examination Guides," widely advertising them in newspapers. The purpose of graduate joint examinations for primary and secondary school students is to encourage students to review their studies and improve their academic performance. The sale of these books not only encourages students to speculate and neglect their studies but also hinders the original intention of graduate joint examinations, harming young people. Therefore, it is imperative to thoroughly investigate and strictly prohibit these books to promote education and uphold the law.</p>

<p>International Race Walking: Chinese Representatives Zhou Ruquan, Lü Chongyi, Lü Wenxia, Zhang Zaojiu - Total of 51 Participants Including Teams and Individuals</p>
<p>A total of 51 people have joined this year's International Race Walking competition. However, four of them are duplicates, so the actual number is only 47. There are teams from four countries, including China, Britain, France, and Italy. There are a total of 20 participants from our Chinese team. In addition to the 16 people registered by the Chinese Race Walking Association, there are four people who registered directly with the association. The association's secretary refused to tell me, and it took a long time to explain before I was allowed to read the list. On the registration forms of three of them, there was only English and no Chinese. They have put their own language behind them, which is heartbreaking. It is also foolish to intentionally prevent people from knowing. I hope the Chinese Association will provide guidance. The list of all Chinese team members and numbers is recorded below:</p>
<p>1 Zhou Ruquan (Team) 34 Chen Liren (Individual)</p>
<p>2 Lü Chongyi (Team) 35 Zhang Xianlun (Individual)</p>

(2) St. John's defeated Ganshi in a one-sided game. GanShi was missing one player, and St. John's also brought four new players to the court. The result was 42 to 26, but this game was not officially recorded, and Ganshi was considered to have forfeited. (3) Xinyang of Group B defeated the French team by a large margin of 56 to 17. Three games will be played tonight. The Group A game between Mailing and Jinan is highly anticipated. The game schedule is as follows:</p>

<p>Rowing vs. Huzhong Group B 8:00 PM</p>
<p>Mailing vs. Jinan Group A 9:00 PM</p>
<p>Hujiang Defeated Chizhi</p>
<p>In the first game, Hujiang played against Chizhi. At the beginning of the game, Hujiang's Qian and Feng scored frequently. Soon, Hujiang led with 11 to 3. Chizhi tried hard to resist, and Qian Dingshen scored two consecutive goals. However, Hujiang's center Wu Guoxiang scored repeatedly from the corner, and the score rose rapidly to 20 to 7. Chizhi stepped up their efforts and reduced the score to 13 to 20. However, Hujiang's momentum increased again, and they took a 28 to 15 lead in the first half. In the second half, Chizhi improved slightly, with Yu Junchi and Zhuo Guorong working very hard. However, they did not gain much, and Hujiang won 51 to 39.</p>

<p>St. John's Defeated Ganshi</p>
<p>Ganshi's basketball skills are still immature and could not withstand St. John's attack. After the start of the game, Ganshi's offense was ineffective, and their defense was weak. St. John's players penetrated the defense easily and scored easily. Ganshi completely lost their ability to resist. The score was 28 to 7 in the first half. Not long after the start of the second half, Ganshi's defender Huai Sidi committed four fouls and left the court. Since there were no substitutes, only four players remained. St. John's did not want to take advantage of the situation and also replaced four second-tier players. In the end, St. John's won 42 to 26.</p>

<p>Xinyang Defeated French Team</p>
<p>Xinyang is organized by overseas students from Daxia and Nanyang High Schools and has considerable strength. It can be said to be a strong team in this year's Group B. It was very easy to defeat the French team yesterday. The French team's techniques were not yet skilled, and their play was disjointed. Xinyang worked hard to meet the challenge and was unstoppable. The score was 23 to 8 in the first half. In the end, Xinyang won 56 to 17.</p>

<p>In last night's Public Exhibition Cup handball match, the Chinese team defeated the Western team 3-2, making the second round a score of Westerners 9 and Chinese 6. However, because the Chinese team defeated the Westerners in the first round, the match ended in a draw, and a third round will be required to determine the champion of this year's tournament. The Chinese team was unlucky and lost the second round, but in terms of strength, the Chinese team will definitely win the final round. In the second and fifth doubles matches last night, the Chinese team was able to use their skills and defeat their strong opponents, adding to the glory of the Chinese team. Although the Chinese team lost in the third match, their performance was excellent. The fourth team lost an opportunity and was defeated. The Chinese team won the first match without effort because the Westerners forfeited.</p>

<p>Special Article: The Progress of the Paris Chinese Painting Exhibition (6)</p>
<p>French "Post Messenger" magazine (June 15th) by Magilen: The Baum Museum is currently holding an exhibition of ancient and modern Chinese paintings. This exhibition is sure to be valued by experts and art lovers alike, as it provides guidance on fine art and enhances existing knowledge. The exhibition was initiated by the Sino-French University and various organizations, with artists Xu Beihong and Liu Hou of the Sino-French University as the main organizers, assisted by Mr. Sa of the Oriental Art Department of the Louvre Museum and Mr. Ge of the Selu Chinese Art Museum.

<p>Comforting Martyr Liehuo, by Yiping</p>
<p>I met Liehuo in the reception room of this building. The editor of this publication introduced us. Both of us seemed to know each other well. Without saying "I've heard so much about you" or other polite greetings, we started chatting. Afterward, we exchanged addresses and agreed to keep in touch. However, I was tied up with work at the radio station, confined day and night in a small broadcasting studio. I really didn't have any free time to separate myself from the machinery and do my own things. Liehuo's address was placed in my wire basket, and there was never a second meeting. Speaking of which, I shouldn't have broken my promise to a newly met friend like that, but I believed that Liehuo and I were people of equal standing, and our time was controlled by economics. Perhaps I was judging others by myself, but in our short twenty-minute conversation, Liehuo's circumstances, my words were not entirely unsuccessful.</p>
<p>Regarding the contributors to this publication, Liehuo thought there was too little connection. He wanted an initiator to gather a few comrades together. I initially had this idea as well, but I feared that people would think we were monopolizing things. This kind of misunderstanding could easily lead to unwarranted accusations. Liehuo brought up this issue that day, and I wholeheartedly agreed. ... We should first connect with those of us who are familiar, and I think many comrades will respond. After this meeting, our radio station officially started broadcasting. Although the work I was doing was so easy and unremarkable, my body was occupied day and night. I had long forgotten the things we had talked about.</p>
<p>Recently, I saw Liehuo's sorrowful heart in this publication. It turned out that his father had passed away. Liehuo spoke with a Henan accent. His hometown was probably in Henan. A person who leaves their hometown and travels thousands of miles to a new environment must have some unavoidable hardships. Although our conversation didn't touch on these things.</p>
<p>I myself lost my father at the age of two. After I became sensible, I only recognized my father's face and voice from that faded photograph. Someone once said that if you lose your birth mother and then live under the care of a stepmother, and if the father is not a bright person, then such a life is the most miserable in the world. However, I think that losing a father can be even more painful. In short, only those who have personally experienced it can understand the suffering. In this respect, Liehuo was much happier than me—much happier than someone who never met his father! Liehuo, your father has passed away, but his spirit remains on you, at least, I believe so.</p>
<p>Do you feel pain that you can't return to your hometown? Liehuo, my hometown is only an hour's train ride away, but I cannot return to my hometown. My hometown does not belong to me. When I arrive there, then that place will be my hometown. In this beautiful late autumn and early winter, I often feel homesick, but I cannot return to my hometown—Liehuo, Henan is not far from Shanghai, but one day you will be able to return to your hometown. Henan is still your hometown after all!</p>
<p>Friend, I hope there will be an opportunity for us to brew a pot of tea and talk for half a day. Strive on the thorny path of life! Your father's spirit remains on you, at least, I believe so.</p>
<h3>Fabricating and Refuting Rumors, by Guanghan</h3>
<p>In times of turbulent situations, rumors often spread particularly rampant in society. When rumors are rampant, people's hearts are confused, and the situation becomes more like "a storm filling the city." Therefore, some people come out to refute the rumors.</p>
<p>Examining the origins of rumors, there are no more than five types. One type is fabricated out of thin air. Taking advantage of restless times, they create false impressions to disturb the public, causing the situation to become more turbulent, so that they can take action. Another type is wild guesses and speculations. They analyze the evolving situation and make subjective conjectures, fabricating rumors. Another type is distorted rumors spread by people. This is the so-called "hearsay," "one person spreads a falsehood, a hundred people believe it to be true." Another type is malicious slander. They deliberately spread unfavorable news about a certain party to undermine its morale. There is also a type that is transformed from brewing facts. Before the facts erupt, these facts will also become a type of rumor.</p>
<p>Rumors have a great impact on the situation. Whenever rumors arise in society, people feel more anxious, and the situation becomes more chaotic. Although rumors are just rumors, they can often become facts.</p>
<p>Whenever rumors arise in society, some people try to refute them. Refuting rumors means refuting the absurd, unfounded, and unbelievable aspects of the rumors. The purpose is to curb the spread of rumors, calm people's hearts, and stabilize the situation. However, sometimes it is difficult for those who refute rumors to be fully believed. Because those who refute rumors often not only refute false rumors but also forcibly analyze even obvious facts. Therefore, the more rumors are refuted, the more rampant they become, and they even appear more truthful. In this respect, what the refuter refutes is less reliable than what the rumor-monger fabricates. Therefore, I believe that if rumors can be proven by facts, then true rumors will die down even without refutation. If what is rumored is fact, then refuting it is useless.</p>
<p>Letter to the Editor</p>
<p>Dear Editor,</p>
<p>In our township, which is more than sixty li northwest of Yancheng, a (geological?) tremor has recently been discovered, which is extraordinarily alarming. According to rumors from people who have come to Shanghai and letters from relatives and friends, the important details are written below:</p>
<p>Starting from the evening of November 13th, we suddenly heard a sound like thunder, followed by shaking of the whole earth; since then, although the times when the tremors occur each day vary, the intermittent tremors have occurred several times every day. When we enquired in neighboring villages on all four sides, which were further away, there had been no discoveries. Everyone realised that it was neither an unusual earthquake, nor the sound of shelling from bombing; therefore, the elders in my township who are of a superstitious mindset, and the rumors and superstitions, present a very terrible situation of terror. They have written to me with questions, and although I know it is definitely a transformation in the layers of the earth, I nevertheless do not understand why, and I cannot go to resolve the unusual terror which fills their — the elders’ — brains. I am specially writing to request that you provide a corner of space in your esteemed columns, and print this so that the general public can study and discuss it, so that I can obtain results and write back to reassure them, and explain away the fear in their unconscious minds, and on one hand so that people have commonplace knowledge of science. I believe that you will certainly be willing to agree to this, won’t you? I wish you good health in your writings.</p>

<p>Shanghai Novel (14), Zhang Lao San</p>
<p>Gao Fei asked me when my younger brother would arrive in Shanghai, and the foolish Xiao Huang let fly a cold arrow.</p>
<p>"A love triangle of two love experts," the dwarf smiled contentedly.</p>
<p>Gao Fei was a relatively honest young man. He thought that before a couple had officially announced their relationship, it was embarrassing for the other party to make overly blatant jokes. He quickly signaled to Xiao Huang, but Sister Min knew that the playful words were directed at her. She asked Xiao Huang in return:</p>
<p>"Mr. Huang, would you like to join a love quadrangle?"</p>
<p>It was a question that neither I, nor anyone else, expected. Although the dwarf could join in with the others' laughter, he thought that failure could not be concealed in any way.</p>
<p>Twenty-Three, French Park</p>
<p>At dusk, we strolled into the French Park. In this old-time recreation area, I vaguely recognized the newly planted small trees by the pond, which were already able to dance in the wind. We walked slowly along the winding path newly paved with yellow sand, able to clearly hear the whispers of the wind blowing through the leaves. A young couple, as if their secret had been discovered, the man pretended to cough, Sister Min smiled and looked up, and I also laughed along with them.</p>
<p>At the end of the winding path was a lawn as green as brocade. We exchanged knowing glances and sat on an iron chair next to a wintergreen tree, silently dissolving into the tranquility of nature as we gazed at the flying white clouds.</p>
<p>I absentmindedly reached into my pocket and took out a pack of cigarettes, but then realized I didn't have a match and put it back in my pocket.</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"No match."</p>
<p>"Shall we go for a walk?"</p>
<p>We stood up at the same time.</p>
<p>"Why don't you ever speak up?"</p>
<p>"What about you?" I laughed, and Sister Min laughed as well.</p>
<p>"Thinking about Sister Hui?" She took a few steps forward as if to escape.</p>

<p>Movie Special</p>
<p>Famous Failures in Film History (Middle) Translated by Jia Gu</p>
<p>Of course, a proud loser always has some "heaven wants to destroy me, it is not the fault of war" attitude. They always want to find some excuses. Either they say that the film is too artistic, or they say that the general level of society is too low to understand the work. These kinds of excuses can be said to be true when it comes to films like Broken Blossoms or DeMille's The Whispering Chorus. But elsewhere, we can say that the fault lies with the filmmakers and not with the general public. For example, in The Courtship of Miles Standish, starring Charles Ray, Charles Ray was originally the greatest star in America, but because he died like a dog in that film, and played the role too lowly, he lost the audience's admiration and obscured his future. Not only that, but Charles Ray lost all of his life savings, six hundred thousand dollars, which he had invested in this film. As for the content of the film, it was lukewarm and had no emotional impact on the audience.</p>
<p>Alla Nazimova also walked a dead end because she wanted to play Oscar Wilde's Salome, and never returned. Nazimova's ambition was too great. She wanted to prove to the general commercial filmmakers that the screen could also absorb a large amount of art. But the film absorbed a large amount of her money. She believed that the American audience had an artistic soul, but their souls could not be awakened.</p>
<p>If you are not completely fair and are biased towards harshness, you can say that these failures are all due to the excessive vanity of the stars themselves. They not only want their stars to shine, but also want to decide how to shine. But this kind of conviction is not real. First of all, we must know that the production of a film involves many people. Star actors and directors, although directly blamed for failure and suffer themselves, but failure, like success, is hated by the entire team. We know that all the staff and actors of a company must believe that the film will be successful when deciding to shoot a film. If a company does not have such confidence among its staff and actors, then the work of this company is simply incomprehensible. When the film is indeed successful, you take credit, and I take credit.</p>
<p>The seeds of failure are also unknowingly planted in this strong, numbing self-confidence. Everyone believes in future success, even if there are occasional doubts, but most of the actors, technicians, and producers always feel that the film will be welcomed by society. In short, from the clear perspective of an outsider, even if the film is obviously going to fail, no one dares to come out to stop the filming process, and pour a bucket of cold water on everyone's heads. In fact, when making a film, the filmmakers mostly do not know whether it will succeed or not until the audience tells them whether they like it or not. One is that those in authority are confused, and the other is that when the situation becomes a tiger ride, they can only move forward with a do-or-die attitude.</p>

<p>Film Review</p>
<p>Review of "My Weakness" by Moore</p>
<p>"Lilian Harvey" is a European star. Hollywood film merchants, because she can attract audiences, spare no expense to invite her to the United States. And "My Weakness" is a script written by the screenwriter for her. A script written for an actor will naturally suit the actor's personality and make it easier to play to their strengths. Like "Lilian Harvey," who is originally known for being petite and lively, plays a role in "My Weakness" that suits her temperament, and her success is not unexpected.</p>
<p>The most suitable role for "Lilian Harvey" is, if I may use an idiom, "a young lady from a modest family." In the famous film "Fallen Angel," she played a shop assistant. In "My Weakness," she plays a maid again. In general, the style of German films is more serious, while American films are more lively. The so-called "style" is the sum of the director's techniques and the actor's performance. If the two are not in harmony, its failure is certain. Therefore, the best part of "Lilian Harvey" in "Fallen Angel" is the long shot of the carriage crossing the street with many small actions, and not the lively expression when she arrives at the Russian imperial mansion. Now, in "My Weakness," she is developing her personality in coordination with a lively approach. The director helped "Lilian Harvey," and "Lilian Harvey" made the director successful.</p>
<p>Naturally, the director's special strengths can be pointed out. Such as the careful observation of psychology, and the sophistication of human relationships. This is the director's usual cultivation, and it is applied in the creation. I think that writers who only study in the photography field should be aware of this: "The lens" fundamentally represents the audience's observation!</p>
<p>The screenwriter wrote the script for "Lilian Harvey," and the director directed the film with insight into the psychology of this kind of person. The success of "My Weakness" is determined. Although Liu Yalis has acted in very good plays in the past, he does not have any special success here.</p>
<p>As for the meaning of "My Weakness," I feel that in a male-centered society, under the current state of private economy, the golden words that lower-class women can only "prostitute themselves to maintain their lives" are completely correct. And upper-class women can only use their beauty to satisfy everything. This goes without saying.</p>
<p>"Love" is regarded by old artists as surreal and supreme; but in reality, all "love" has conditions. Like the young master in this film who is unwilling to fall in love with a maid, on the one hand because she is a maid, and on the other hand because of livelihood issues, and the final combination is simply a manifestation of disguised dominance consciousness. Naturally, "a talented man and a beautiful woman" is an intentional distortion by the producers.</p>
<p>"Cupid's Golden Arrow" can only hit people's hearts through money!</p>
<p>Review of "Penthouse" by Ling He</p>
<p>It is said that Chinese sound films do not sell as well as silent films in Southeast Asia. The reason is nothing more than that Southeast Asian audiences cannot understand the dialogue. Similarly, some American sound films are not universally welcomed by Chinese audiences. The above reasons can also be explained in the same way. Especially when the complex plots are hidden in the dialogue, it is even more annoying to enthusiastic audiences. The reason why American films are translated into versions in European and American countries is precisely because of this. So, why is there no Chinese version? This is of course because the Chinese film market is too weak, which is very uneconomical in the producers' wishful thinking.</p>
<p>Above, after I watched "Penthouse," this view immediately floated into my mind again. Isn't this an obvious fact? When I walked out of the theater in the crowd, I immediately heard someone say: "I simply don't understand it." Another lady asked an old woman: "Is it good?" The old woman said: "I don't understand foreign languages, what is the point." Of course, I am not entirely because the box office of Da Guangming is not as lively as in the past (the opening of Da Shanghai is also a reason for reducing the audience), but it is a very obvious fact that this kind of film is not welcomed by Chinese people.</p>
<p>However, is the quality of a film completely determined by the amount of box office revenue? Of course, this is the most foolish thing. At least we have to affirm that the author here is indeed very hardworking. The director's description of the personalities of several main characters is consistent and meticulous, so that the audience can gain a complete understanding. The thug's burly body and clumsy posture clearly portray his violent and loyal personality. The youth's sweat dripping on his forehead when he was in prison clearly shows that he is not deeply involved in the world and cannot tolerate the slightest suffering. It can be affirmed that he is a wrongly accused suspect in the massacre.</p>
<p>Speaking of this, we can see that although this film should belong to the detective genre, it is very different from general horror and suspenseful detective films. At least it does not use overlapping suspicions or misdirection. Originally, the author was only using this to complete a love story.</p>
<p>Isn't it? The playwright very tortuously explains this story. Male A loses love with Female B, Female B falls in love with Male C, Male C breaks off entanglement with Female D, Female D renews old love with Male E, and finally, Male A and Female F end up happily together. Please think about it, how many male-female entanglements are there here? However, the author's intention is not in the romantic history between men and women, but its theme is to make a positive sermon for the current society. A lawyer uses his sophistry to release a thug, allowing him to escape the death penalty and roam freely. Of course, the lawyer cannot avoid the criticism of social justice, and even his lover breaks up with him. Later, the lawyer finally worked very hard to eliminate violence for society. As a result, the thug, who had done all kinds of evil, "laid down his butcher knife and became a Buddha on the spot" by shooting the murderer, and also committed suicide. —Thus, this lawyer is again sympathized by people, and he is somewhat a brave and upright man with achievements.</p>
<p>However, on the other hand, we see that the law is such a ridiculous thing. A lawyer can actually enable a thug to escape death. Conversely, why are there no appropriate legal grounds for massacring innocent people? Several supporting roles performed very hard, and the protagonist Warner Baxter was successful again.</p>
<p>Postponement of the Lianhua Reunion</p>
<p>The Lianhua Film Company's colleagues' reunion, originally scheduled to be held on the 6th of this month at the Lianhua First Factory. However, recently, the factory's film production work has been quite tense, and the entertainment content of the reunion itself also needs to be fully prepared. Therefore, there is a proposal to postpone the meeting. It is said that the organizing committee of the meeting also regards this meeting as the best expression of the sincere cooperation of all Lianhua colleagues, and it should not be held hastily. It is now decided that within the next week, after the factory's work comes to an end, all efforts will be concentrated to quickly promote its realization, so that this grand event can be concluded satisfactorily as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Shirley Mason Returns</p>
<p>By Donglin</p>
<p>—Has reached a compromise with Paramount—</p>
<p>When Shirley Mason suddenly left Paramount, it caused a great shock in the American film industry. Shirley went to Europe by boat after leaving Paramount. This caused nervous speculation that she was going to sign a contract with the French film industry. However, speculation is ultimately just speculation. Shirley healed her throat in Europe and returned to the United States by boat. This time, the Hollywood film industry paid attention to her future actions, because they all knew that American film companies would never hire her. Unexpectedly, Shirley suddenly reached a reconciliation with Paramount and signed a compromise agreement. Her first work is called "Reunion."</p>
<p>Film Novel</p>
<p>Little Women (3) by Su Yin</p>
<p>In the evening, the Laurence children were again looking out the window. He saw that the Marches' house was lit up, and they were putting on a play. Qiao was playing the role of a robber, wearing long boots. After a while, Qiao was playing the role of a hero. Meg was playing the role of an old monster. Amy was playing the role of a prince. Beth was playing the role of a frightened child. When their play was over, everyone clapped their hands. Hannah came in and asked them to go to dinner. He was both anxious and happy because the window of the March family's dining room was covered by a curtain, so he couldn't see their joyful expressions after they discovered the miracle! But he knew they would definitely be in for a happy surprise.</p>
<p>The March children entered the dining room together. Qiao was the first to see a table full of sumptuous feasts on the table, and she shouted, "Christopher Columbus! What is this?" Amy opened her mouth wide and opened her eyes wide and said, "Did a fairy come?" Beth said, "This must have been sent by Santa Claus!" Meg asked, "Did aunt send it?" Mother smiled at everyone and said, "This was sent by the old Mr. Laurence across the street. Today, the old gentleman somehow learned about what you did this morning, so he sent so many things, and there was also a letter saying that today is Christmas, and he wanted to send some small things for the little girls to eat, and he told me not to refuse." Everyone was so happy that they couldn't believe it. That old man Laurence had always been thought of as an old monster! He often sat in a luxurious carriage, and the little girls didn't dare to say good morning to him. This was really a strange thing. "It must have been his grandson who came up with the idea—I know," Qiao said as they sat down. She thought of her determination to get to know him, which strengthened her even more.</p>
<p>The next day, there was a lot of snow outside the door again. Qiao put on rubber boots and cleared the snow that had accumulated overnight with a broom and shovel at the door. She was happy for a while, and then made a snowman out of the snow pile. She also remembered her determination yesterday, so she grabbed a handful of snow, made a light snowball, and threw it towards the Laurence family's window. No sooner said than done. The opposite window opened, and a smiling face was facing her. It was Laurence's grandson. He shouted, "Hello!" Qiao pretended to be serious and said, "Hello." Then she said, "I want to thank you. We all enjoyed the Christmas gifts you sent very much." She saw the child pull his collar tight to cover his chest, and she asked, "What's wrong? Are you not feeling well?" The child said, "Just a little cold. My grandfather let me rest in the house for a week and I'll be fine." Qiao said, "Isn't that boring? What do you do for entertainment?" He shook his head and said he had no entertainment. Qiao asked, "Can people come and see you?" He said, "As long as people are willing to come, there is no reason why they can't." Qiao heard this and immediately ran back to ask her mother. After a while, she got her mother's permission and ran out again. She walked up the steps of the Laurence house, waiting quietly for the people inside to open the door.</p>

<h3>England Closely Watching - Can Only Be Regarded as Italian Public Opinion Trend - Not Willing to Consider at Present</h3>
<p>(London) Last night, the Fascist Party Congress resolved that Italy should remain a member of the League of Nations, but on the condition of fundamentally reforming the League of Nations in the shortest possible time. Official circles here declared that although the Fascist Party Congress has made this decision, the British government will not consider it until the Italian government officially notifies the League of Nations with an official document. Before formally notifying the League of Nations, this decision is only regarded as the party's tendency and desire, and is purely an internal Italian matter. (Havas dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>(London) The resolution passed by the Fascist Congress regarding the reorganization of the League of Nations has aroused great attention among Londoners, but they feel that it has not actually changed the situation. This only confirms the trend of Italian public opinion. British official circles have not commented on this issue. However, all parties that support the League of Nations say that slightly modifying the League of Nations Covenant will inevitably be slow and cause many disputes. (Reuters dispatch, 6th)</p>
<h3>France Adopts a Wait-and-See Attitude</h3>
<p>(Paris) Responsible parties in Paris declared that if the League of Nations Covenant is to be modified, it must require the unanimous consent of the member states. France will wait for all parties to unanimously agree to reform the organization before it can agree. (Reuters dispatch, 6th)</p>
<h3>Berlin Enthusiastically Supports - Considers it a Preliminary Step Towards Revising the Treaty of Versailles</h3>
<p>(London) The Berlin Evening News enthusiastically supports what they call Mussolini's "ultimatum," calling it the first step towards revising the Treaty of Versailles. Semi-official circles in Berlin say that the League of Nations is always useless and is nothing more than a club for the victors. Italy has undertaken a difficult and unappreciated task, attempting to implement a bold and truthful process. (Reuters dispatch, 6th)</p>
<h3>Avenol Will Go to London to Inquire About the British Position</h3>
<p>(Geneva) League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol is scheduled to come to London on Sunday. Due to Italy's proposal, this trip has attracted more attention. It is expected that Avenol will take this opportunity to inquire about the British authorities' opinions on Italy's recent developments. (Reuters dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations authorities expressed surprise when the Italian Fascist Party Congress, after a report by Mussolini himself, requested the reorganization of the League of Nations. According to reliable sources, when League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol recently went to Rome, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini never revealed his true plans. Mussolini had also explicitly declared to several governments that Italy had no intention of withdrawing from the League of Nations. These governments were quite surprised to hear the Fascist Party's decision today. The first impression of European diplomatic circles on this matter is that Mussolini was the initiator of the Four-Power Pact. When he saw that the pact was about to fail, he rescued it in various ways. His strategy was to free the Four-Power Pact from the influence it felt during its negotiation. In other words, the close relationship between the pact and the League of Nations was originally not considered by Italy, but was added later at the request of other countries, and then he tried to remove it. Italy has been engaged in this action for several months. The decision of the Fascist Party Congress is the development of this strategy. Mussolini is extremely opposed to the legal equality of all member states in the League of Nations, which is something that everyone agrees on. The main point of Mussolini's reform plan may be to remove this constraint, that is, to abolish the consensus mechanism of neutrality in Geneva and replace it with a control mechanism composed of several major powers, and to include Soviet Russia. According to the communique issued by Rome, the organization, operation, and goals of the League of Nations are all to be revised. If the Italian government implements the resolution of the Fascist Party, it will take action from today. When the League of Nations Executive Council meets next January, Italy may submit a concrete reform plan. However, the scope of this reform plan is vast, and Rome probably does not think that the goal can be achieved in a short period of time. (Havas dispatch, 6th)</p>
<h3>Japan Watches Developments with a Cold Eye</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has not received a detailed report on the Italian government's issue of reorganizing the League of Nations. An official from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs expressed his opinion, saying that after Germany withdrew from the League of Nations, the European political situation was on the verge of crisis, and the League of Nations was incapable of dealing with it. Therefore, Italy raised the issue of reorganizing the League of Nations. The previous League of Nations discussed the Sino-Japanese issue, which led to Japan's withdrawal. This has proved that the League of Nations is an unrealistic organization. Italy has always been dissatisfied with the fact that Britain and France monopolize the League of Nations, so this reorganization plan is serious. The reorganization of the League of Nations is a difficult issue, but because Italy's attitude is strong, it seems that it may withdraw from the League of Nations, so this case cannot be taken lightly. If Italy withdraws from the League of Nations, the League of Nations will be completely destroyed. Japan will continue to observe how European countries resolve this issue. (United dispatch, 7th)</p>
<h3>American Public Opinion is Skeptical</h3>
<p>(New York) American newspapers commenting on the Italian Fascist Party Congress's decision to reorganize the League of Nations mostly acknowledge that the League of Nations itself has various flaws, but they doubt whether the plan to reorganize the League of Nations can be realized in the short term. The "New York Times" holds this attitude. As for the "New York Herald Tribune," it said that if one wants to implement the plan to reorganize the League of Nations without causing a comprehensive problem related to the dignity of the member states of the League of Nations, it would be very difficult.

<h3>British Newspapers Consider it the Omen of the League of Nations' Demise</h3>
<p>(London) The ultimatum issued by Italy to the League of Nations is regarded here as a major historical event. Most newspapers regard Italy's demands as the omen of the League of Nations' demise. Only the Times believes that the League of Nations' foundation is solid and fearless, and that constructive reform is also an urgent plan. The Daily Telegraph said that the British government is well aware of the need for financial reform. If this issue can lead to any solution, it can be resolved in a spirit of reconciliation. The newspaper also said that British Prime Minister MacDonald will, in any case, make Britain occupy the position of mediator in the League of Nations negotiations. These negotiations will begin when League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol visits London. Political circles believe that Italy may take the opportunity of the League of Nations conference in January next year to propose a grand reform resolution. (National dispatch, 7th)</p>
<h3>French Newspapers Say it is No Less Than Becoming a Five-Power Cabinet</h3>
<p>(Paris) The Paris Times clearly pointed out the significance of Italy's proposal, saying that it is no different from forming a "Five-Directorate Cabinet" of major powers on top of the League of Nations' organization (the name of the administrative department formed by the five directors in the French Revolution). (Reuters dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The Paris Echo criticized the resolution of the Fascist Congress, saying that it would rather have no League of Nations than a League of Nations that unites Italian and German imperialism. The London conspiracy can be considered certain, but Paris has the final say. France can only uphold the fundamental provision of Article 10 of the League of Nations Covenant, which stipulates the territorial integrity of all countries. (Reuters dispatch, 7th)</p>
<h3>Austrian Newspapers Say it Will Cause New Disputes in Europe</h3>
<p>Vienna The "Federal Post" congratulated the Italian Fascist Party Congress's proposal to reorganize the League of Nations, saying that this plan may be the most important factor in maintaining peace. However, the "New Free Press" believes that this proposal will become a new issue of dispute among the European powers. (Havas dispatch, 7th)</p>
<h3>Czech Newspapers Oppose Restricting the Rights of Small Countries</h3>
<p>Prague Czech newspapers unanimously believe that if Italy's plan to reorganize the League of Nations is limited to simplifying the League of Nations procedures, it can be accepted. However, they all strongly oppose restricting the rights of small countries and separating the League of Nations Covenant from the Treaty of Versailles. For example, the "Czechoslovak Newspaper" said that the League of Nations Covenant and the Treaty of Versailles are inseparable. If one is abolished, the other will be destroyed. If this is the case, the League of Nations will become a tool for revising the treaty. (Havas dispatch, 7th)</p>
