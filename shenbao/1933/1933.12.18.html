<h3 id="c44">時評　英國調解歐洲糾紛舒　法意對立加增法德關係之惡化 <a href="#c44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>歐洲大陸自德意志退出軍備縮小會議後。法德關係。愈見緊張。凡爾賽和約。呈現動摇。而意之利又從旁贊助德國之行動。近且公然提議改組國際聯盟。另圖更新現局之道。吾人就事實上觀察。國聯爲凡爾賽體系之國家所操縱。殆已無可否認。但德國不肯久屈於凡爾賽和約。而現在國際聯盟中有力之國家。又僅有英法意三　。美國雖爲民族自决運動之首倡者。然爲保持門羅主義起見。始終不肯參與國聯之活動。蘇聯以政體不同。已另樹體制。日本亦不願受國際公約限制而脫離國聯。今德國復以要求軍備平等。而自動退出。是則國聯之實力愈少名義上之號召亦愈弱矣。惟今日之歐洲。不特國際聯盟感受軍備擴張之危機。民族對立之恐慌。且各國國内。莫不感覺預算之不足。人事問題之紛至沓來。無法彌補。設使無根本上謀和平之道。竊恐不待薩拉齊之一料子彈之突發。亦足以使世界重陷於一九一四年之悲境也。</p>
<p>在法國之本意。以爲現狀果能維持。則前途自有光明希望。國際聯盟縱非神聖。但尚能解决歐陸當前之紛爭。德國方困於經濟恐慌。擁抱五百餘萬之失業工人。焉有餘力以從事於純粹消費之軍備建設。實現其意想中之眞正軍國主義。不意希特勒竟以此激動其國人。并藉軍需工業以剌激其産業界之興奮也。同時意大利急欲發展其國力。而四週乃爲法蘭西所限制。凡爾賽和約之保障者丨國際聯盟。爲法國之屏蔽。亦即意大利在中歐伸展之障碍。是以德國退盟不久。意國即提出改組國聯之主張。由此愈加顯見意大利爭覇之雄圖。法國之不安。於是更甚。旣須防備德意志帝國之復興。又恐意大利之出柙縱横。不得不竭力防備。使其傳統政策之「安全保障。」得以眞保安全。而不受外來脅制之恐懼。無如此種防備。愈加嚴密。則對方之防備。亦愈爲緊逼。相互激盪之餘。遂助成危機之暴露。歐洲政局之動摇。實基於此。</p>
<p>假使世界經濟恐慌。不如此深化。則戰禍早在九一八之時即行爆發。初不特至今日而始云危險也。然目前歐羅巴諸國之對立。確已僵化至於不能自解。長此以往。祇有各人揮其利劍以斬開此僵局。不過此時之德國。尚不堪一戰。意大利實力亦未充實。蘇聯對西歐之外交。力主和平。是以根本衝突。雖不可避免。而眼前形式。似尚可緩和。英吉利洞悉此中形勢。乃起而作調和法德爭執斡旋法意對立之運動。</p>
<p>英外相西門將乘下週聖誕節假之暇。週游歐洲。與法德意及其他各國交換政治意見。借此打開軍備縮小會議之難局。英國此舉而果能成功。則英國對於和平前途。貢獻殊大。所可顧慮者。德國此時决不肯放棄其軍備平等之主張。且更進而要求收回薩爾煤區。完全撤廢凡爾賽和約。因爲意大利所同情而更益堅持。至於法國方面。非特不肯輕於放棄其安全保障之主張。對凡爾賽和約。視爲當然中之旣成事實。且亟力主張以英法軍事攻守同盟。爲對德軍備平等要求與交還薩爾煤區之條件。此種條件。又豈英國所能輕諾。德國所能忍受。意大利所能默認者耶。况英國之本意。絶不願歐洲大陸有獨覇之國。彼又安肯助法國之獨覇歐洲。是以國境交錯政情複雜之歐洲諸國。欲其予盾之根本消除。殆不可能。但善於調處者。能使彼此勉强讓。留維一時之和平。或尚可勉爲耳。</p>

<p>楊氏答記者問、首稱、粤省自二十·二十一·二十二·三年以來、金融狀况、日益枯窘、省銀行對於鈔票之現金凖備、幾被撥用殆盡、計數總有三千萬元、至其他各項公債等類欵項、亦早經收用無餘、其數又不下三千餘萬元、兩者共計約六千餘萬之多、此即省金融之虧空、而不得不亟於救濟者、復查此項虧空、原屬中央方面、中央似當贊助粤省、謀所以救濟之道、而粤此次借欵之動機、乃即在謀金融之救濟也、</p>

<p>星期六曁南對交大在交大作江大足球賽、交大學生毆傷裁判員沈回春事件、詳情已誌昨報、體育界對於此事、憤慨異常、對於交大體育主任申國權及該校球員之袖手旁觀、不盡保護之責、尤爲不滿兹將昨日各方面之表示、及沈君傷勢情形、探錄如下、</p>
<h3 id="c220">沈君傷勢一般 <a href="#c220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>據沈君談、當場被毆、受傷待門外羣衆分散後、卽趨車自投同仁醫院醫治、當晚因傷勢較重、卽寓院中、計左耳受傷甚重、流血甚多、據醫生謂、恐須失去聽覺、右腰亦受重傷、疼痛非凡、當卽敷藥包紮、今晨遵醫生之囑、出院略事走動、使血脈流動、不致淤積、惟因腰部不能用力、行走殊覺不便、</p>
<h3 id="c221">備受冷言譏諷 <a href="#c221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>沈君又談、當時被毆倒地、若非陳昺德將余從地上拖起、並曁南守門葉培初及屠君開元之保護、擁人體育館中、恐性命不保矣、但至體育館後、備受交大球隊幹事之冷言譏諷、後出校門時該校體育主任申國權、非特不表示歉意、反責問「此十二碼球實不應該罰」云、此球之應否處罰、本人不必加以辯正、明達者當能明瞭、申君身爲大學體育主任、竟出此言、其道德精神、可想而知、</p>
<h3 id="c222">由裁判會交涉 <a href="#c222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>沈君又談、今日（卽昨日）上午申國權見各報對交大下深刻之枰擊以後自知理屈、卽赴體育恊進會問明余之住址後、卽至舍間訪余、似欲和解、余當時對申君聲明、君聘請裁判員係向運動裁判會聘請、非直接向余聘請、余之出任裁判、係受裁判會之委派、故余與君不能直接談判、余唯有將事實經過、報告裁判會、聽裁判會如何解决耳、惟承君前來慰問、感激不盡、</p>
<h3 id="c223">周家騏君談話 <a href="#c223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>全國體育恊進會幹事周家騏君、亦交大校友、並任交大體育敎職多年、亦昔日足球名將、對於運動道德精神、夙甚看重、是日周君亦在球場、據周談、沈觀瀾之撞倒徐亞輝、應該受罰、在下半時將終時、交大學生卽態度不當、似有動武之表示、申國權在旁問之、莞爾一笑、果然、比賽終了、沈君被毆、然申國權及交大球員、竟不上前救護、實不應該、申君應於比賽後、卽護沈君入體育館、如此學生卽欲滋事、亦所不敢、申君不此之圖、學生乃益形故縱矣、</p>
<h3 id="c224">余衡之君談話 <a href="#c224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>曁南大學體育主任余衡之君談、予鑒於大學足球比賽之一再發生風波、故予是日極力防止球員踢球不可野蠻、但是日交大球員之衝撞、頗多不合法、徐亞輝有一次被對方撞痛、向裁判員抗議、當卽受裁判員之嚴責、謂「汝毋多言、否則罰汝出場」、（按裁判員沈君昨亦作此語）有一時期、予對對方行動、憤慨非凡、當時眞想告本校球員亦以此對付、但究竟此非正當行爲、徒然發生意外、故予始終禁止球員不准野蠻、上半時終了後之休息時間内、徐亞輝曾對予表示、予卽嚴責、必須照常比賽、不必多言、事後裁判員沈君之被毆、誠不幸之極、</p>
<h3 id="c225">陳昺德亦受傷 <a href="#c225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>復旦大學體育主任陳昺德君、亦在場參觀、並爲最先救護沈君之人、據陳君談、沈君被毆倒地後、余卽將沈君抱起、及其他二人（按卽曁南守門葉培初及屠開元君）保護入體育場、惟因此余背上亦被交大學生毆傷、至今猶覺疼痛、當時羣衆毆打之時、余爲救護沈君計、曾將藏照相鏡之皮匣、（形似手槍匣子）作技槍欲擊之狀、並嚴詞令羣衆散開、其實余並無手槍、果然被余騙過云、誠是日紛擾中之趣聞也、</p>

<p>東華昨以五對一之結果、戰勝臘克斯於西聯甲組賽中、雙方均精銳善戰之士、勝負得失良難判别、當東華一對一和局時、臘克斯中堅西蒙士受傷出場、遂以十人應戰、而至終了、勝利之歸東華、固不待結局而定耳、</p>

<p>臘克斯負悠久歷史、以軟硬兼全名於滬濱、今雖稍衰、固不失一上乘之球隊、當其與東華疆場相見之初、駿騎四出、邊陲爲之不安、門庭雖先遭禍、銳氣轉成激昂、努力之下、造成和局、惡運驟降、大將得傷、如是以後、圖存無力、受人宰割而已、老將阿爾傑不减當年威風、中鋒哈培克奔射咸佳、左右輔佐、善於接濟、東華稍一不愼、卽紛入擾亂、中堅西蒙士前後兼顧、全隊柱石、此君一傷前途頓失希望、内衛線不及中衛線之堅硬、故東華一旦兵臨城下、立見緊張、守門尚能盡職、所失五球、非其獨咎、</p>

<p>開戰之初、臘克斯五前騎、分途進襲、東華宣告戒嚴、暫取守勢、五分鐘之後、球始離東華而趨臘克斯、賈幼良利用時機、舉足挑中、李義臣側身讓去、萬象華迎門射去、球似滾入門綫之内、而被人救出者、惜未爲裁判員目覩、難定究竟、顧縳眼間、陳洪光中途接濟、李義臣身處人羣之中、窺清目標、一脚射去、正中紅心、傳得全場采聲、</p>

<p>臘克斯一球失後、銳氣未衰、前鋒仍不絶進攻、初向中路探試、繼轉向左邊、阿傑爾一脚、球自門前落下、三前鋒同時並進、周賢言警機過人、躍起擊出、戴李兩氏、載奔載傳、龍門旣近、戴勿失脚、滿腔熱望、付之東流、臘克斯又呈活躍、先假道於左陲、繼流傳至右邊、再返球於中骨、哈培克如飛射出、頓入網内、成一對一、</p>

<p>和局之後、形勢隨變、戴麟經授意於賈氏、賈不負使命、步步爲營、最後一射、誤人守門手内、全功盡棄、其時所謂臘克斯之柱石西蒙士忽中傷出場聞焉、李義臣久伏思動、偶然起勁、奪來一球、轉交萬氏、萬氏不加考慮、卽行傳中、戴麟經全身撲出、以頭代胸、迎入門内成二對一、嗣後屠開元接濟合度、而李義臣不善措施、交臂失之、上半時告結果、東華二對一占先、</p>

<p>下半時起、東華先下總攻擊令、前仆後繼、屢退屢進、不久、敵方犯十二碼、李羣臣一脚成功、成三對一、阿爾傑一度親加射擊、周賢言早知此着、單臂擋出、李寗吳幼良聯合抵抗、球又出境、賈幼良右陲直下、蒙氏中路遥應、接得來球、向門射去、被守撲出、李榮安趕到、輕輕撥入、成四對一、戰局將終、萬氏一再努力、傳球門前、李老臣射球打中門柱、彈回未遠、戴麟經匹馬追至、加上一脚如願以償、結果東華五對一</p>

<h3 id="c240">兒童家庭敎育論 <a href="#c240" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e240" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">240</a></h3>
<p>— 愼言</p>
<p>在某一個時期裏，我的隣居是一家日本人家，這人是一個操業很微賤的印刷工人，家裏祇有夫妻二個，和三個小孩子，連女下人也没有一個。男人出去之後，女的在家洒掃洗刷，工作是一分鐘也不間斷的，所以他的家裏眞是收拾得織塵不染，清潔非常。這當然是使我十二分欽佩的。但是這些情形，西洋人家裏也許還可以看得到，其最令人折服的乃是兒童們的家庭敎育。舉兩個例，就得使我們中國人愧死了。</p>
<p>第一件以禮貌敎導兒童，每天下午三四點鐘模樣，他們日本小學便散學了。照例我總能聽到一陣緩和而響亮的叩門聲，於是我就從樓窗上望過去，每次總是先見那個女人滿面笑容的走出去開門，門一開便見三顆小腦袋同時俯將下去，各作一個九十度的鞠躬，然後最大的孩子在前，第二個在中間，最小的在最後，循着次序走進來；但也並不呆木，並不遲鈍，態度儘極活潑，而一種守秩序，敬尊長的舉止，見了眞敎人感到日本人的不可及！</p>
<p>第二件是盡量以愛國思想灌輸入兒童的小頭腦。有一天，大概總是什麽天長節一類的節令日，他們一家照例都換上了新衣服，並在那座曬臺上扯起了一面太陽旗。上午在家慶祝，高唱國歌。下午夫婦倆出去參加什麽集會，三個小孩子都掮着小小的太陽旗到弄堂裏來游玩；後來不知怎樣那個最小的孩子忽把那旗弄破了一角，被兩個大的孩子看見了，忙走過去責備他。最大的一個女孩子，并向我甥女要了一些槳糊，把那一面小國旗補好，很小心地捧回了家去。據伊告訴我的甥女說，弄壞了國旗是逃不了他們父母的一頓最嚴厲的責罰的。</p>
<p>從以上兩點看來，日本人的强盛上是一件理所當然的事情；而他們的成功，得方於家庭敎育者實多。所以我覺得我們對於自已的子女們，必須盡量的施以適當的家庭敎育，不能把敎育兒童的責任一古腦兒的丢給學校裏的先生們去負擔。要知道兒童苟不施以相當的家庭敎育，結果不但將影響及於家庭的幸福，且和國家的前途，也有莫大的關係呢！</p>
<h3 id="c241">僕役 <a href="#c241" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e241" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">241</a></h3>
<p>— 傅翼之</p>
<p>僕役，看來是一種種輕易的職務，不需要苦力們那種負重行遠的大力，也無須使用機器的技能，尤其不需要端着算盤，計算盈虧，或蘸墨伸紙，寫些什麽「策論」的文才，只要摸着主人的性了，知道主人的愛憎，慇懃地侍候和唯唯地聽命；遇着主人險遭危害，在可能範圍裏表現出一副勇敢的拚命地挺身維護的神氣，便已足夠一個僕役的資格，說不定主人信任之後，還可以有升到另一階級的希望。</p>
<p>但，這是指從前的家員，書僮，與現在所謂的勤務，聽差，以及其他個人的僕役而言，倘然是充當團體裏的僕役，那就不似如此簡單而輕易；比如一個學校或者一個公司行號底茶房吧：大學的校長，院長，系主任，很多是當代的「名流」，自然有他私人的聽差；資本雄厚的公司行號裏的總裁或總經理，是站在社會最高層的一種人；尤其有武藝很</p>

<p>— 錢澐作文棟良作畫</p>
<p>許多已結婚的朋友對未婚的人，稱他是孩子，其實討了主婆要他究竟何用？在都市裏的女人，只得　曲了頭髮點紅了口唇，在面前給你笑，伊們很願意自已的丈夫當伊哈巴狗似的；如果你高興，更不妨把伊撳住打打小屁股，伊到會自動的來吻你據說現代的夫婦，玩這類把戲，人家會說感時髦。</p>
<p>高或者玲瓏透頂的私人僕役，我們可以不去提他。若在普通的學校與平常的公司行號裏，只有公共使用的茶房。這茶房，每一個先生都有使喚他的權限，任他乍樣聽命，耐勞，不貪懶，總有供應不周的地方，張先生喚他有事去了，李先生呼他不應，未免有點不高興；反之，張先生亦要怪他，我想，世間再没有比這更吃力不討好的事。</p>
<p>在老於經騐世故，而且是聰明伶俐的身當其境，却也可以勝任而愉快，那便全靠他的眼光能夠測量先生們的權力，即小至吃飯擺菜，也不能不按照這標凖進行。比如吧；桌上有校長，敎務主任，訓育主任，以及其他主任，敎員；或者是總經理，經理，營業主任，帳房，以及其他小職員，而這一席菜最名貴而適口的要算「冬菰半鳴」，便該把這盤菜擺在校長或總經理座位的一面，次貴的擺在權力次點的一面，蹩脚的，不妨擺在「蹩脚」的敎員或小職員的面前；如果在同一時間有事被呼喚，也按照這標準挨次做去；若呼喚者爲權力相等的先生，那就非權衡緩急不可，没有權力的，不妨藉口無暇，横豎奈何你不得。</p>
<p>這秘訣，最近纔從一個有十多年茶房歷史的舉動上觀察而得；但，旁徵博引，發覺這秘訣應用很廣，儘有懷此而得名利雙收者，不特僕役爲然，呌絶而外，不能不歸咎於自已的落伍！</p>
<h3 id="c243">結婚 <a href="#c243" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e243" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">243</a></h3>
<p>— 俞友清</p>
<p>在這幾天的蘇州馬路上，幾家大旅館，都是掛燈結彩，借爲結婚的禮堂，有新式的婚禮，也有新娘用紅巾遮了面孔，不滅遜清時代的儀式，無論新式式舊法，在西風聲中，舉行婚禮，多少感覺一些甜蜜而有深奥的趣味。</p>
<p>誰說結婚是愛情的墳墓，看到一對對的佳耦，未見得都是墳墓中人吧！本來在夜凉似水，孤衾不温的寒夜，有了兩個人同衾合睡，多少減去些冷氣，尤其是燕爾新婚，十分的夠味，所以在廢曆的小春天氣，旅館都借作結婚的禮堂，也許爲了氣候的關係，使人家不得不將孤男獨女，配成一雙兩好了。</p>
<p>舊法結婚，將不認得的一雙男女，牽合攏來，在大庭廣衆之間，雙雙揖拜，將來的命運，眞在不可知之中，但是舊法的結婚，還是抱些舊禮敎支配之下的眼光，眞所謂嫁雞隨雞，嫁狗隨狗，對於未來的一切，大都是彼此隱忍下去，若然講到新式的結婚，我多少有些懼怕，因爲郎若然没有財，女若然没有貌，對不起没有多時，就發生問題了，他們看結婚好像串一齣戲一般的玩耍，勞燕分飛，各自東西了。</p>
<p>我看到旅館中電燭輝煌，結婚的熱閙，但是一回過頭來，在間紙店的櫃台上，看見ＸＸ日報封面上登着ＸＸＸ大律師代表ＸＸＸ與ＸＸ女士離婚的啓事，不覺打了一個寒噤，結婚確實好像是串戲了。</p>

<p>第二十回　卜吉有期老人連日笑　剷愁不盡舊雨對門居</p>
<p>這話說得桂枝聽了，也就掩口而笑。江氏找了一盒火柴，遞到趙翁手上，趙翁接了火柴，擦着一根，向上一舉，這才想起來了，自已掏出那盒紙烟來了，口裏說着話，覺得手上多了一樣東西，彷彿着又揣到衣袋裏去了。於是將火柴交還了江氏，由胸裏再摸出紙烟盒子來。可是紙烟盒子摸出，又想起火柴已經交還了别人了。一會子工夫，前後顛倒，只管手足無所措，便笑道：我這是怎麽了，要烟没了火，要火没了烟，哈哈！江氏笑道：老大爺眞是痛兒女的，聽說自强要完婚了，樂得不分晝夜，合不攏口。趙翁笑道：可不就是那樣說嗎？從昨兒個我就樂起了。江氏道：由現在到喜期，大概還有些日子啦。要是像您這樣的樂，那可了不得。趙翁笑道：你没有聽見說過嗎？樂是與衛生有益的事，樂多了，還可以延年益壽呢？再說，我也就是在這幾天發發笑罷了。過了這幾天，一等自强回信到了，我就要忙起來了，要樂也來不及啦。他口裏如此說着，手上拿了一根烟捲，只管在紙盒子上頓着。江氏又把那盒火柴，塞到他手上，笑道：點上烟抽罷，回頭您又把烟收起來了。趙翁這才擦着火點了烟抽着，坐下來慢慢和江氏談心，說是各處的信都發了，以後要慢慢的預備一切事情了，您這邊有什麽要辦的事情，也得辦了。江氏道：我這邊有什麽可辦的呢，除非得着老太爺所帮貼的幾個錢，和我們桂枝做幾件新衣服·趙翁道：就是這個，你也得辦啦。成衣匠做衣服，總是拖延日子的。（二七○）</p>

<h3 id="c245">主婦須知洗濯常識 <a href="#c245" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e245" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">245</a></h3>
<p>— 佩美</p>
<p>洗手套</p>
<p>天氣漸寒，手套是一樣禦寒的需要品了，對於手套的種種常識，我們值得知道的。這裏有幾種可使手套經久耐用的簡單而有效的方法，不妨一試。</p>
<p>欲洗精製的白羔皮手套，先把手套戴在手上，然後用一小塊法蘭絨，蘸了熱的麵粉、用力磨擦一下，對於大拇指和其他的手指間，要特别的注意。用力擦了一陣之後，以良好的刷手硬刷來，把麵粉屑粒刷去，手套便出新了，且無絲毫損傷。</p>
<p>已經污穢的顔色手套和白色的羊皮手套，有一種簡單的出新方法，就是放在一個闊頸的瓶子裏，瓶中滿儲大量的氣油。手套放入後，以塞子把瓶口塞緊，輕輕地把瓶摇動一回，摇後靜置數小時，然後取出，用一塊乾布揩擦手套，再把手套放在隂凉的地方，使氣油完全揮發去。污穢的手套經此一番的洗滌，可以奐然一新，而且這一瓶的氣油，可以一再應用，毋需洗一次換一次、很是經濟。</p>
<p>洗滌棕色羊皮手套的最好方法，是用内中有少許切成碎片的肥皂，或肥皂粉溶解的熱牛乳來擦。先把手套平舖在一塊厚毛巾上，後用一小塊法蘭絨，蘸了溶有肥皂的熱牛乳來擦。最後把手套的手指拉直，手掌拉平，掛在通風的地方使乾。</p>
<p>洗黑色的羊皮手套，要用同量的良好黑皮鞋油和純粹的橄欖油，相混合調和的溶液來擦。洗臆羚羊皮手套的最好方法，應在肥皂泡沫中，（俗稱肥皂水，普通用肥皂粉來溶的）這種肥皂泡沫是用肥皂片或肥皂粉和以一品脫（容量名）的硼砂使軟化之沸水所製成。在肥皂泡沫中洗後，再在加有幾滴橄欖油的微温水中洗濯數次，每一次洗濯，須換一次水，至洗清爲止，這樣的洗，臆羚羊皮不致變硬。</p>
<p>洗衣服</p>
<p>洗濯小件的羊毛織物或羊毛衣服的最快而有效的方法，是把他們放在一隻底上有多數小孔的濾器中，這濾器是放在一隻置有温暖的肥皂泡沫的器皿中。先把羊毛的織物或衣服，緊緊地靠向濾器裏面的四周圍上，用力的搓揑，然後在微温的水中再洗幾次，洗後就在濾器裏面的四周圍上，用力把所洗的東西掀到差不多把水分掀盡了，纔把他們舖在平面的物體上，如桌上或洗衣板上等。舖時要當心，切不可把他們拉緊拉長。舖後待乾時，要時時把他們翻身在進行洗濯顔色衣料之前，最好先把他們浸在加有大量鹽的冷水中使濕透。這樣，在洗濯的時候，可使顔色不退。假使不用這一番預防手續，顔色一定受損害，不過顔色受損害後，可以使他回復原狀的，祇要用海綿來蘸了同量的家用醋與冷水混合液，潤拭所洗的顔色衣料欲使法蘭絨洗後不變硬不變氈，只要在最後一次洗清的用水中，加入少許的橄欖油卽可。每一加侖的水中，加一大匙的橄欖油便足彀了。假使把顔色的女用絲襪，預先放在加有數滴松節油的温暖肥皂泡沫中過一夜，然後再洗，决不退色。每一夸爾（容量名）的肥皂水中，加一大匙的松節油就彀了。</p>
<p>用熨斗或烙鐵燙平衣料或衣服之前，最好先把他們噫水着潮。舊的噴水方法是用口噴，或用手灑，不甚便利，現在市上有洋鐵或黃銅製成的噴水器。假使要經濟的辦法，不妨用一個有軟木塞的玻璃瓶，祇要在軟木塞的一邊，刻一小槽，便可代替手指灑水了。</p>

<p>從去年今日發刊到現在，恰是一年。一年來承蒙醫藥兩界的贊助和提倡，我們非常感謝，特别是幾位擔任撰遽的諸君。他們在百忙之中，嚴寒或溽暑之下，握管爲文，替本刊生色不少。這種努力的精精，來鼓勵我們，努力奮門，我們更當努力進行。</p>
<p>但是轉來一看我國醫藥界的情况和去年一比，還是一般的混亂無進步；而在外國，即如日本，蘇聯，亦時常有新的發見與發明。我們所當感慨的，是人家已把科學來對付我們，而我們還在討論是否需要科學，眞使我們有無限的心痛！</p>

<h3 id="c248">本刊一週紀念小言 <a href="#c248" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e248" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">248</a></h3>
<p>— 龐京周</p>
<p>本刊創始到如今。已是五十二期。剛剛合着一年。所以出一張「一週紀念的特刊」。京周受主編者的委託。在此說幾句話。而自問也是愛護本刊的熱烈份子。更不容不說！</p>
<p>論本刊的宗旨。無非宣傳科學醫藥眞諦。灌輸衛生常議。那是在發刊的時候。已經由編者發表過了。如今旣已按照這個宗旨。工作了一年。我們自應想想本刊是否盡職。　於這一點。我以爲已經證明。本刊是可告無罪的了！爲什麽呢？因爲本刊發行至二十期至三十期時。曾經京周提議。在本刊上登過一個啓事。盡最徵求讀者的意見和批評。這一個啓事。登了亘五六期之久。結果是並未得到指摘。足見是本刊的一切。已受了大衆的默許。也就是本刊的盡職。</p>
<p>其次。我們就要沽計一年以來。因本刊的工作。而得到的效果。關於這一點。完全有數目字可以計算的。大概看報的人都知道申報每天的銷數有十五萬份。當然本刊每期的銷數也是十五萬份。因爲本刊是附在正報上的。並不是登在什麽本埠附刊上的！中國現在每一份報紙。平均要有十個人看。那麽每一期文字。就灌輸到一百萬個腦子裏去。每年五十二期。就是五千二百萬次映入人們的眼簾。這個鉅大的數目字。横寫起來。居然要在五二以下。加上六個○○呢。在聰明的人。聽了一回梅蘭芳的覇王别姬。往往就會學他那句「碧海青天夜夜心」的念白。本刊的觀衆。旣然有五千二百萬次之多。也可以抵得梅博士在天蟾舞台唱一萬天戲。（天蟾舞台大約可容五千人）。就等於唱了二十七年半。依我想起來。大概總有許多人。非但能念「碧海青天夜夜心」。恐怕「蘇三離了洪同縣」「王寶川低頭用目看」也就朗朗上口了。於是可以推知新醫的眞理。已能深入人們頭腦之中。倘然也像如今的京劇。由一人傳十。十人傳百。相習成風。大家喜歡兩句。那麽中國醫事的進展。豈不可以立待。這是本刊十二分慶幸的。</p>
<p>但是正面文章雖如此說。而反面想想。安知讀者的不批評本刊。不是社會對於醫藥問題的冷淡。安知不是讀者看報。光看了東北議和。先看了閩變發生。而對於本刊竟覺得不值一顧呢？安知不是讀者以讀本刊的時間。移作看「覇王别姬」呢？</p>
<p>即使果眞是合着上面的數目計算。那麽我們也得想想。全國的人民有四萬萬之多。四萬萬人。一年之中。才聽過五千二百萬次戲。就等於八個人每年只聽得一次。能不能算普及呢？我們還得拿本刊和好萊塢的電影名片比一比。一片做上幾百份考貝。在全世界各大都市連映上幾個星期。觀衆有多少呢？</p>
<p>啊呀！想到此處。我不免要高呌一聲「本刊尚未成功，同志仍須努力」！</p>

<p>上月二十五日。滬上各報。載有救丐恊會。第二次會議情形。謂本市乞丐。數約共三萬人。年需經費百萬。以爲救濟之用。誠哉視民如傷。仁者之用心也。竊意慈善事業，發端於惻隱。而惻隱。又基源夫人類之同情心。惟慈善家之所以能實行其慈善者。必先同情於本身家族。而后再推已及人。可澤被蒼生。蓋眞能摩頂放踵。從并救人者。鮮矣。簡明言之。一身。一家。一族。宋能温飽。必不能旁顧他人之温飽。一身。一家。一族。先免爲丐。始能援救他人之爲丐。然則慈善事業。發於人類之同情心。而同情心。能否達其永久救濟之目的。又須視救濟之方術如何。按之人類能力。雖各有不同。然而自衛競存。與夫好生惡死。胥係通性。而人之墮落爲丐。縱不能指爲盡屬政治不良之結果。大都因家庭及社會環　所造成。其一小部分。或者爲舉業失敗之弱者。間亦有爲受境遇打擊而陷於消　之行動。然而推其根本大原因。皆昧於經濟物質上。生産消耗不能平均之結果。就此一點。我輩可暫時爲其平均整理。而不可永久爲其負擔扶助。所以救濟方術。宜糾正其生産消耗不能平均之錯誤。而切戒代負其生産消耗不能平均之賣任。今國中之以慈善相號召者。大概偏重代負消耗。而疎於代謀生産。故愈救濟。而乞救者愈多。愈救濟。而受救者愈惰。此慈善事業之最不澈底。所謂自陷日深。弄巧成拙者也。夫人之所以爲人。必具有自食其力之本能。上至學士大夫。下至輿　走卒。苟非疲癃病癈。應有動作可能。不然者。直是自絶其衣食也。顧我上下。都病於懶。資産階級懶。則喪産。　産　　　。　流爲丐　。　况　字之外。　有助或其爲　爲　爲　　不　之事乎。以此　情流　之　。　　　家與以不歡　之　濟。無　　與其爲丐爲　爲　爲盜之心也。　乎可。是故主持救丐恊會　公。旣發大兹悲。大　心。欲加　於　　無告之貧民。不可不認定目　。以養　其生　　力爲前　。切不宜以負擔其消耗物負爲　責。則本市三萬人之乞丐。或可逐漸减少。每歲百萬元之經費。或能使甚自負。因擬數則。用供諸公之參考焉。</p>

<p>— 周君常</p>
<p>嚴冷已屆，我人欲保持兒童之健康與快樂，應特别加以注意，特草下列數條，以備愛子女者之參考。</p>
<p>（一）空氣日光新鮮空氣與日光，爲使兒童强健之必需品，日光經過玻璃或衣服者，無濟於事，必須直接曬到身體，始能帮助發育，並可阻止軟骨病之發生。故雖嚴寒之天，仍須游戲於户外日光之下，吸收多量之新鮮空氣，如遇風雨之日，則着以較暖之衣服，在室内游戲，惟所有之窗，皆須開放。</p>
<p>（二）冬季之衣着兒童在冬季雖應較爲多穿，但亦不可太厚，因能使活潑之兒童舉動遲鈍，故在室内可少穿衣服，出外時再加輕暖之外衣，羊毛絨製之外衣，及護腿褲，最適於游戲時之穿着。</p>
<p>（三）準季之飲食每日須有多量之滋養物，但應知冬季兒童，不必較夏季時多食，此外宜注意每日須有充分之飲料。</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>（四）沐浴天　時之沐浴，與天　時同一需要，如浴室温暖，何懼受寒，每日入浴更摩揀其身體，可使其皮膚舒暢，及增加抵抗力。</p>
<p>（五）午睡每日之午睡頗有益於小兒之健　，較大之兒童可代以休息，兒童有充分之休息，可減少種種啼哭發怒等情。</p>

<p>— 龐京周</p>
<p>（乙）特殊部份。</p>
<p>（一）神經系，</p>
<p>一知覺（清朗抑昏迷）。二頭痛，頭暈，三睡眠，四震顫，五譫妄，（聲音變態），六反射作用，（瞳孔反射等），七知覺神經與動作神經上種種障礙。</p>
<p>（二）消化器系統，</p>
<p>一唇，舌，二喉頭，小舌，扁桃腺，三胃納，四口渴，五嘔吐，六大便，七檢視腹部與按診腹部，（是否痕滿，傾陷，按之有無作痛之處，有無腫瘍之處。八打診腹部。（是否氣痕，水腫，有無腫，瘤，）更打診肝脾等部是否正常。九檢騐胃液及大便。</p>
<p>（三）呼吸器系統。</p>
<p>一胸廓搆造，二呼吸是否調匀，三呼吸動作。（急，慢，方式，充足，偏於一側等），四咳嗆，與痰狀五打診所得各症，六聽診所得各症，七胸部捫顫。與枝氣管副聲。</p>
<p>（四）血行系統。</p>
<p>一心臟部位之觀察。二大脈管之觀　。三按診心搏。四按診心尖跳動。五打診心之位置大小。六聽診心音如何。七聽大動脈管音。</p>
<p>（五）小溲。</p>
<p>一自主解下，抑遺尿，有無痛苦。二二十四小時中總量若干。三與水之比重若干。四顔色清濁。五酸性抑鹼性。六有無蛋白質與糖。七沉澱中含有何物。</p>
<p>照上面這些條件看來。要是初學診斷疾病。除病人性别，年齡之外。就須查考三部十三項六十五條細目。然而在醫家診病習慣上。自然没有這麽麻煩。靠着經騐。自然可以用刪繁就簡的方法。提綢扼要的檢查。診斷出一個病來。然而反過來說。却有許多痛。雖然件件都查到了。也許還没有得到確斷。而必須持續檢騐大小便，咳痰，流出物等。或再看他的病勢如何經過。有的還要用肛門鏡。子宫鏡。喉頭鏡。膀胱鏡。等器械來診察。甚而至於用愛克司光透視。總之斷一個病。有極困難時。有極複雜時。决不是像普通問病討藥的那些來函那麽簡單。就可以得到一個妥當的治療的。别的不去管他。單是病人不給醫生見面。那麽診斷要素裏的「診察」已不能解决。光用了一部份的「主訴」。就是照舊醫的口頭禪說。望聞問切四字。也只做了一個問字。豈不是離題太遠了麽。所以我以爲問病討藥。是極端不妥當。若眞眞要引起讀者的醫藥興趣。只有三種途徑。似乎還可補救。（一）積極廢除問病討藥習慣。而改在刊物上。發表各種疾病的常識問答。像程瀚華君近來在申報醫藥週刊所發表的體裁一般。（二）消極的辦法。將問病討藥。加上一個規定的範圍。只有某一類輕微之疾。可以通信徵醫家的意見。而來函的陳述。至少要有一張底稿。排列着幾項必要的項目。病家須要充分的塡寫。方可作答。（三）所有醫藥刊物上之問病欄一律改爲衛生常識，生理常識的顧問欄。却不可再用廣泛的醫藥意義了。</p>

<p>談免疫性（幼者與長者的分别）</p>
<p>吾們有時遇着他人的問題，說究竟年幼者（自新生嬰孩起）的免疫力，（普通可說抵抗力）即是抵抗一種病菌的能力，是否與年長者相同？這個問題在血清學方面，亦時常研究與討論，其結果可說是幼者的免疫能力，是較年長者爲弱。在新生的嬰孩，幾乎可說是没有，就是對於侵入身内病菌，幾乎不能抵抗，即使稍有抵抗能力，亦與年長者大不相同。是故吾人對於嬰孩的血液檢查，如梅毒反應等等，常使其在至少六個月之後爲之，較爲妥當。不然即呈無毒反應，亦不足憑其爲無病之現象，近來有人亦仍把此問題從新研究，（動物試騐）其結果亦與上述相等，故即提筆談之。（按上述之免疫性，是專對自動性的，其被動性之血清效力，則在幼者與年長者相同。）</p>
<p>談弗利氏的肺癆治療藥</p>
<p>ＦriedmimschesTuberculoseMittel</p>
<p>弗氏的治療法，是一種依照免疫學理製成的苗漿，其成份爲一種冷血動物身中取得的癆菌，其意欲使受接種之癆病家，能在他的身體中生産一種抵抗素，而治療其病體中之癆病。冷血動物的癆菌，是對於人類幾無毒性，故依弗氏之意，是絶無危險性，他的意思極好，但是治療結果，並不若他的意科之佳。在歐美二洲，雖有若于年的治療經騐，然至今稱頌其效力者，寥寥無幾，記者因知滬上亦有發現，故將其最近成績報告於留心此藥諸君，以備參考。</p>
<p>肺癆專家斯得曼，在最近二年中治療二十病例，其中百分之五十是由用此藥品後，反使其加重症象，又百分之二十五則不變化，又百分之二十五則爲輕病家，故不能辨别牠的效力。</p>

<p>— 程瀚章</p>
<p>（二十一）肺氣腫和肺膨脹</p>
<p>（問）什麽呌做肺氣腫？</p>
<p>（答）肺氣腫，就是肺臟内含蓄過度的空氣而致異常擴張的狀態。放是肺臓本身十分擴張而彈性消失。</p>
<p>（問）什麽呌做肺膨脹不全？</p>
<p>（答）這是和肺氣腫相反，空氣含量很少甚至完全没有空氣；於是肺臟本身萎縮。</p>
<p>（問）肺氣腫怎樣起的？</p>
<p>（答）大都是因爲慢性的支氣管炎（塵埃烟草的吸入，飲酒的人）和支氣管　　喘息的病，與及肺臟反復受强壓的時候（吹喇叭，玻璃吹工）而起。但就一般而論，似乎有體質闕係。</p>
<p>（問）肺氣腫的病狀怎樣？</p>
<p>答病人的胸廓擴張，像洋酒桶的樣子，差不多完全取吸氣時的姿勢。胸銷乳突肌和斜角股着明突出，頸靜脈努張，頸短，胸廓抵抗增加，呼吸運動微弱，肺活量當然减少。</p>
<p>（問）醫師在打診冷和聽診的時候，有什麽症狀可以證明呢？</p>
<p>（答）打冷時，有紙匣音，肺臟下界降低，呼吸時肺緣的移動性減少。聽診時，肺胞音减弱，呼氣延長。又有乾性或濕性水泡音。</p>
<p>（問）Ｘ光線攝影時有什麽現象？</p>
<p>（答）肺臟部非常透明，横膈扁平，必右室擴大。</p>
<p>（問）心臟也有病的變化嗎？</p>
<p>（答）有的。打診時心濁音界縮小（這是因爲肺臟被覆之故）聽診時心音微弱動脈第二音强盛。</p>
<p>（問）肺氣腫病人容易起什麽病？</p>
<p>（答）容易起支氣管炎。</p>
<p>（問）肺氣腫的治療方法怎樣？</p>
<p>（答）病人要避去各種原因，勿吸入塵埃，移住到氣候佳良的所在，使慢性支氣管炎全愈。藥劑則用袪痰劑像吐根酊洋遠志，　化錏等。有咳嗽的時候，可用麻醉性鎭咳劑。心臟衰弱的時候，用洋地黃等强心劑。呼吸困難的，可用芥子泥貼在胸部，行胸廓壓迫法，使帮助呼吸。</p>
<p>（問）肺膨脹不全的原因怎樣？</p>
<p>（答）有先天性的，有後天性的。後天性的原因，是支氣管閉塞，近部臟器的壓迫，呼吸肌衰弱等。</p>
<p>（問）肺膨脹不全的病狀怎樣？</p>
<p>（答）後天性的呈呼吸困難，胸廓呈吸氣狀的陷没，聽診時呼吸音微弱和支氣管音等。</p>
<p>（問）這種病危險程度怎樣？</p>
<p>（答）先天性的大多死亡。後天性的，關於原因和患部的廣狹而不一定。</p>
<p>（問）肺膨脹不全的療法怎樣？</p>
<p>（答）應注意原因，變換體位。應用興奮劑和强壯劑，病人每天行温浴和深呼吸。</p>

<h3 id="c257">讀「孝經」 <a href="#c257" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e257" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">257</a></h3>
<p>— 曹聚仁</p>
<p>前見報載，某將軍令學生讀「孝經」。近阜寗董某忤逆其父，寫信索欵，自稱大太爺，直呼父名；阜寗縣長將董拘押，令其誦讀孝經。這一部僞書，（孔子「志在春秋，行在孝經語」，見孝經緯鈎命决，不足爲信。或謂孝經出於曾子，亦不足信；孟子稱曾子「養志」之孝，孝經中絶無此說。孟子答公都子問匡章不孝，主張「父子不責善」與孝經「故當不義則爭之」的主張亦相反。此書蓋漢初儒家所作，與孔孟曾子無關。疑孝經始於朱子，清姚際恒已有定論。）在今年居然這樣交運，眞是出乎「意表之外」。</p>
<p>我是自幼熟讀孝經的，但我不相信這部書對於世道人心會有什麽裨益。日俄戰爭以後，日本的小學生常有在放學的路上，結羣毆打的事；歐戰進行中，是本小覺兒童也常有彼此刃傷的事；這都是受國與國之間的敵愾心所暗示而反映到他們心理上的。近年中國社會種種反倫常的現象，仔細加以考察，也都是另一種社會現象的反映。自從滿清末年，奔競之風大開，明裏暗裏，都在奬勵失節賣身；投機之外無所謂操守，利害之外無所謂道義。這樣一個大動盪，什麽倫常關係都激起了變化；師生，朋友，兄弟，父子之間，自然變成打算盤的交易了。另一方面，由於都市所孕育的個人享樂觀念，把對家庭的責任心　低了。多少老太爺老太太在兒媳的小家庭裏，寄人籬下，仰承鼻息，比僕役還不如。若說逆子應該讀孝經，則今日摩登小家庭之主人翁應讀孝經者多矣，豈獨董某應該拘押嗎？</p>
<p>熊佛西先生曾寫過一本洋狀元的劇本，那位稱呼「父親老同胞」，「母親老同胞」的洋狀元，並非虚構之詞。從外洋歸來的洋狀元，他覺得洋倫理樣樣都對，中倫理樣樣碍眼；寗可替「飛洋傘」做忠僕跑腿，决不肯替老太爺擔負；寗可在電車上讓不相識的密司坐位，决不肯讓老太太休息一回。人有廣送太上感應篇，而效果全無者，勸讀孝經的結果大概也如此。</p>
<p>目前最切要的工作，不在廣讀孝經，而在砥勵操守，大家莫再奬勵失節賣身，才是道理！</p>

<p>— 靳以</p>
<p>那一天晨間起床的時節便覺得頭是沉沉的，好像已經不是支在自已的肩之上，而是垂到地下了。</p>
<p>「怕又是生病了呵！」</p>
<p>我自已如輕烟一樣地喟嘆着。</p>
<p>「什麽樣的困苦都能挨過去，單身人若是病起來，倒是有些難辦呢！」</p>
<p>很早所說過的話追想起來的時候，驚惕地打着寒戰了。</p>
<p>病却是更顯然地在身上爬着，我的臉燒成紅紅的，下頦再也懶得張開來，頽然地拖了更懶的步子。自已便恨恨地說：</p>
<p>「還不如死了爽快呢！」</p>
<p>坐到椅子裏，就想着爲什麽又病起來。於是想到昨晚無着落的夢。但是這不也是太空了麽，縱然不是一個寡情的人，若是只爲了已經忘却我的一個女人在夢幻中之一現，就因之而病了呵，不也是太可笑了麽？但是，我的頭是昏昏地，我用手支着。</p>
<p>說到病，自已并不怎樣怕着它的。看見了在病痛之下呻吟着的人，自已却曾由衷心發出了自已來替那人受苦的心願。我能忍病痛給我的殘害，而且那麽多次，它并没有引來人類最後的好友丨丨死亡。</p>
<p>我的紅色的臉一向爲人說爲健康，而他們再也想不到這健康人有了那麽衰弱的心。這將像我的好友，能隨我一生的了。但是這點忠誠也是頗可喜的，只有在過分的憂鬱與怒憤之下，它要吩咐我暫時地離開這世界。但是它總是送我回來的，讓我看看我是躺在一個人的懷裏，或是從地板上自已爬起來，摸摸臉上跌破的傷。</p>
<p>我病了，從心裏發出不可抵禦的冷來。我的身子在抖着，牙齒在互擊着；可是我圍上領巾，披起大衣，走出了門。我用遲緩的脚步走着路，走過一座又一座的紅門，喫力地走上了那拱背的橋。向北我望到了北海裏那襯着藍色天空的圓塔，有着白的顔色，高遠而寞然地站在那裏。但是低下頭來，浮在好看的綠水之上的，則盡是焦敗的荷葉與荷梗了呵！</p>
<p>我像得着點什麽而走回去，我實在覺得我的頭是過於沉重了，我又睡到那床上去。</p>
<p>一整天我不知道是睡着或是清醒，有的時候像有那麽一對眼睛在我的眼前閃了一下，可是立刻就没有了。我不知道在那裏，我也不知道到那裏去。</p>
<p>曹昏，從烏鴉的翅膀上滑下來了，當我睜開了眼睛，看着漸漸黑下去的房子，已經到了開燈的時分，可是我不能站起來。我凄然地翻了一個身，爲這寂寞之感呵，我又忍不住掉下涙了。</p>
<p>但是，懷了孩子心的友人走進來了，他殷勤地問着我，把手放在我灼熱的前額上。</p>
<p>我深深地嘆息着。</p>
<p>我的病在使我忍受了一天的苦痛之後又悄悄地走了。這樣，我又健壯地站起來，用筆寫着或是用嘴說着：我可以做一個獨身漢子的，我能自已安然地活着可是，我只希望病是我最生疏的客人</p>

<p>（三）</p>
<p>在「文藝茶話」二卷五期的「蘇滬往還」篇裏，孫福熙先生說，他在蘇州，游了一回天平山。他在「畫舫」裏所得到的印象之一是：</p>
<p>蘇州的轎夫多爲女子，故可名爲轎婦，其勇敢耐苦的精神實在可以欽佩。但剌剌論價與討酒錢，點心錢，草鞋錢的　（這個字我認不得，又無字典可查，恕不註！夢）瑣，實在把這種勞苦的精神降低了不少。</p>
<p>夢原曰：此「菊花哲學」也。哲學而名之曰「菊花」，就是「清高」的意思。譬如蘇州女人，能「勇敢耐勞」矣，如果再束緊肚皮不要錢，那麽，給「游客」的印象不是更好，更統一麽？而要要錢，且討之不休，這自然要使人從「可以欽佩」的立塲，一變而爲「精神降低」的感嘆了。蘇州女人，聽了孫先生的話，不知亦能改途易轍，從此不吃飯，從此抬轎不要錢乎？</p>

<p>— 侍桁</p>
<p>懋庸先生：</p>
<p>因爲「自由談」的編者不願將此問題占去篇幅，看到先生的信就非常爲難，有不能不略答一兩句的必要。先生牽出唯心論和唯物論的藝術論的分歧，這在我看來全然不是那麽一回事。我一再講的，是想使先生先認　藝術的眞實，然後才能講到社會的眞實或歷史的眞實，這理論的步驟，並非緣於什麽唯心論或唯物論的觀點的不同。無需遠求，那論「鐵流」的Ｇ，揑拉陀夫，無論如何不能說他是一個唯心論者吧，但他也不能完全抛掉藝術的眞實而就論「鐵流」之歷史的眞實的。我想所謂唯心論和唯物論的主要的不同之一點，卽一在只以藝術的眞實爲完全的論旨，而一在以藝術的眞實作爲達到社會的或歷史的眞實的手段的。如果這樣，先生稱我爲唯心論者，豈不寃哉！至於關於「沙寗」，我們都一致承認它是歷史地不眞實的，但我是說它之不眞實是頗有關於其藝術的不眞實。而先生最初就否認這一步，可是最後的這一封信裡，先生可以說：「我也不曾把藝術的表現置於現實的認識以次的地位」。那麽這有什麽可爭論的呢？</p>
<p>先生指摘我的曲解之處，我還是不能承認，按照先生的那機械的藝術的看法，雖不至於就認定吉訶德必爲騎士，漢烈特必爲丹麥王子，但對於藝術人物與社會的存在的　合所使用的機械法，其結果仍然說不掉相等的繆誤。</p>
<p>如果先生還一定說我是一個唯心論者，我希望先生能給我以詳細的解剖，我也頗願領敎而給自已以修正。但只搬出决定藝術的」有「社會的存在」的那原則，我是不能服佩的！</p>
<p>我是承認這問題現在已可告一結束，如無新問題的提出，我是决定不再答，因爲要節省「自由談」的篇幅，請恕我不　一切的客套。</p>

<p>她聽着這話不禁暴怒起來，烏龜這兩個字太難聽，並且她以爲這是間接剌她的。</p>
<p>「你這話是爲着誰說的？」</p>
<p>「爲着哲安呀！看他們這樣子實在滑稽！」</p>
<p>她感動得太利害了，微微類慄着，以很低的聲音咕嚕道：</p>
<p>「啊！筆爾，你多麽殘酷喲！這個女人卽是正直的化身。你弟弟是决不能找到比她更好的。」</p>
<p>他簡直放聲笑起來，一種故意的，突發的笑。</p>
<p>「哈！哈！哈！卽是正直的化身！所有的女人都即是正直的化身……而所有她們的丈夫都是烏龜。哈！哈！哈！」</p>
<p>她一聲不響，立起身，達忙跑下那傾斜的砂灘，冐着滑倒，跌進那些隱　在草底下的洞裏，折斷腿或臂的危險，一往直前的，差不多跑着一般，穿過那些泥路，向着她的另一個兒子走去。</p>
<p>哲安看見她走近來了，便呌道：</p>
<p>「怎的？媽媽，你决定來捕蝦了嗎？」</p>
<p>她没有回答他，抓着他的手臂，好像要對他說：「救救我罷，保護我罷！」</p>
<p>他看見她那樣慌亂，大吃一驚；</p>
<p>「你臉色多白啊！你究竟怎麽的？」</p>
<p>她吃吃的說道：</p>
<p>「我差一點跌了，我提心吊膽地走過了這些礁石。」</p>
<p>於是哲安引導着她，扶着她，把捕蝦的法子講給她聽，以便引起她對這事發生興趣。可是因爲她一點也不留心聽他的話，而他又感到一種要把自已的秘密講給什麽人聽的猛烈的要求，他便把她帶到較遠的地方，低低地對她說：</p>
<p>「你猜我做了什麽事？」</p>
<p>「可是……可是……我不知道。」</p>
<p>「猜猜看。」</p>
<p>「我不……我不知道。」</p>
<p>「那麽我告訴你罷，我對陸太太說過我想娶她。」</p>
<p>她什麽話也不回答，她頭鳴腦昏，差不多快要不懂他的話了。她復說道：</p>
<p>「娶她？」</p>
<p>「對啦，我幹得不錯嗎？她是很可愛的，不是嗎？」</p>
<p>「是啦……很可愛的……你幹得不錯。」</p>
<p>「那麽你贊成嗎？」</p>
<p>「是啦……我贊成。」</p>
<p>「你說這話時現得多麽奇怪啊。别人以爲……。以爲……你是不滿意的。」</p>
<p>「但我……我是滿意的。」</p>
<p>「眞的嗎？」</p>
<p>「眞的。」</p>
<p>爲着證明她確乎滿意，她把兩臂緊抱着他，在他的臉上吻着，那種母親給孩子的沈重的接吻。</p>
<p>隨後，當她把眼睛裏浮上來的幾顆滬水，揩去了時，她看見那邊海灘上有個人背朝天睡着，像一具死屍似的，臉孔埋在砂裏，這是她的另一個的兒子，那在苦思着，絶望着的筆爾。</p>
<p>於是她拉着她的小哲安走得更遠，走到距離波浪很近的地方，他們很久的談着這宗婚姻，這是她所最關心的事情。</p>
<p>漲起來的海水把他們趕去和那幾個捕蝦的合在一塊，國後大家回到了岸邊。把那假裝睡着了的筆爾喚醒。那天晚飯吃得很久。大家喝了很多酒。</p>

<h3 id="c262">經濟制度與經濟社會湯崑 <a href="#c262" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e262" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">262</a></h3>
<p>在現在的經濟社會中，只敎稍欲懂得些中國經濟狀况的人，他們無不絶端的在咀咒資本主義經濟；他們咀咒資本主義是吸人血肉的魔鬼。而且資本主義的經濟，在中國士大夫階級尤其反對得急烈，因爲中國是現在正在吃資本主義國家的經濟侵略下的一員敗將。這原因是中國自已的不振作；而在自已國家的基礎上就打錯了底，我們中國隨便一種生産技術都較别個國家爲低劣。在美國，日本，和英國，他們因爲發展資本主義國家的立足點，不惜以全副的國家精神去謀資本主義所寄托（顯言之是一種藉此剥削的陣地）的别國的市場；甚至於因此不惜與他國以利害關係的衝突，造成兵戎的相見。觀於現在太平洋上的戰雲漫瀰，日，美，俄，英各國都磨權擦掌預備因自已國家以資本主義的必要上，再閙一次世界的大戰。同時將來不久這種因資本主義國家占奪市場開始的大戰問題，逐鹿的中心正是我們遠東；而這個地方，還是我們中國，這原因就是中國我們自已的生産技術不精，而人口之衆多，執世界之牛耳；因人口之衆多，社會消費能力亦隨之而大，於是這種現象下，在生産過剩的資本主義國家，是最垂涎；而成資本主義侵略上必占的市場。同時中國内政的窳敗；和匪亂之頻仍，各資本主義國家莫不認爲俎上之肉了。因其如此，所以中國之咀咒資本主義不是絶對的没有理由。有了這一種反對的理由，在新近中國的經濟學界，頗有傾向於社會主義的動向；但是究竟中國的現在是不是需要社會主義的經濟制度；或是這種社會主義的經濟，在中國是不是做得到，却是一個很大的問題。原因是中國的經濟社會向來没有組織，你不能說他是資本主義的經濟，社會；又不能說他是社會主義的經濟社會。中國目下的經濟制度，與經濟社會，他完全是舊社會跟着新經濟思想而趕不上的一員落伍者。在英，美，等國他擁有多量的工廠；從這些工廠裏，能有多量的生産；不論這多量的生産，於經濟社會需要或不需要，但是他們能造成資本主義的條件不能加以否認他是因此而造成的。在蘇俄，經濟組織是十足趨勢在社會主義的經濟制度上，他能够在政府的管轄之下，對於各工廠加以統計，一切生産與經濟上與國家發生的關係，能在政府的統領之下，予以寛放或緊縮。至於我國中國呢？與其說是資本主義國家，這眞是笑話？不惟失去還没有藉以侵占他國經濟市場多量工廠；簡直自已的工廠還是幼稚得很，在别個資本主義的國家的危象之下。同時其他的資本主義國家，還正在盡力侵略我們的市塲，在上海租界一隅，各國工廠林立，每年利權外溢不知多多少少；那麽這個樣子當然是不是資本主義的國家；而且還不能否認是中國現在是吃着資本主義國家的虧的一個可憐虫。至於社會主義的國家呢？似乎中國也没有具備社會主義的經濟組織的國家。政治上是缺少了强而有力的政府；和政府統領的能力。在經濟上，是在國内缺少多量的工廠，能自給那些國人的消費；那麽中國到底是怎樣的一種經濟制度，與經濟社會呢？這個問題似乎是難題，自然資本主義制度在中國是不可能；同時也不能的；而且進一步講，卽使能夠這樣會造成比任何國更多的失業工人；和許多社會混亂的資料。至於社會主義的經濟制度呢？中國現在一般經濟學者的言論上，的確有幾分趨勢；但是可能不可能却是一個問題，當然經濟制度的變更，不是一朝一夕的事情；徒然高調唱唱是無益的。要研究這個問題，只敎我們自問中國現在能不能實行社會主義經濟的時候。自然中國現在無論談那一種經濟組織都不可能的，因爲中國現在是一個生産技術落後的國家；同時國内的内政不能統一，匪盜横行，而列强的壓迫，像犯人帶着鐐鑄，陷於一個半殖民地的狀態，同人倘使每一個人都想求臺最低的生活限度；事實上還是不可能。這個主要原因，因爲一個經濟組織的造成，牠完全是持有多量的工廠；及多量的生産，以及具有剥削他國經濟市場的工具；在中國，這些都没有，所以中國如果欲造成社會主義的經濟組織，第一步還是發展自已的生産，使中國人民個個能夠自給而無缺。同時在内政上，端然不能如此的渙散，因爲在中國現在的經濟的狀况下，這地的生産品往往不能容納那一地去；試想國内自已有着這樣的隔膜，而想因持有一種思想而就想實現社會主義的經濟組織，當然無異是做着一個夢。不過中國的經濟趨勢却不能掩飾是趨向到社會主義的路途上去的，國内的各業予以統計；經濟技術的没法改良，都在隨處表現着中國是逐步向社會主義的路途上去的。我們在這表不願說着像預言式的話，我們在現在只有隨便一種制度祈祝他只敎能夠成功。</p>
<h3 id="c263">英美法之貨幣戰趙超構 <a href="#c263" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e263" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">263</a></h3>
<p>現代經濟組織以貨幣爲基礎，貨幣價值之變動，足以决定經濟界之動向。世界貨幣的主宰爲美元，英鎊，法郎。目下正是這三種貨幣混戰的時代，這三者貨幣的一笑一顰是支配各國經濟的因子；這三種貨幣的歸宿也就是世界經濟的歸宿。所以爲了解世界經濟起見，便不能看過這三者的動止，通過這三者，也可以窺見世界經濟的一側面。</p>
<p>但雖說是三種貨幣的混戰，我們不可不分别考察，第一個主戰的禍首是美元，在戰塲上他是主動的一位，他如果肯安定的話，鎊與法郎的安定是不成問題的。英國雖屬停止金本位之列，但他早就希望滙兌安定，滙兌平衡基金固爲防止鎊之上騰，也不防上鎊價過落的作用，不過美國如果積極挑戰的話，他當然也出來應戰。最苦的是法郎，法國自由於金本位制度以内，便不能以壓低滙兌來抵抗，祗好以關稅等方法來防守，不用說没有反攻的能力，究竟能否抵禦英美二國的夾攻，尚成問題。</p>
<p>Ｘ　Ｘ　Ｘ</p>
<p>美國通貨政策的目標在提高物價，羅斯福膨脹通貨以後，起初對物價頗有相當的效果，但八月以後，又發生反動的現衆，股票物價逐步下跌，於是纔决意運用新的通貨政策，卽是購買國内外黃金·據羅斯福的聲明，想把物價提高到相當程度，再把美元價值安定這一點。爲達此目的，的以由政府買金，壓低美元。照美國貨幣法，一翁司金合二○·六七元·而政府買金的價則在平價以上。十月二十五日的買金價格爲每翁司三一·三六元，高出平價三四％。</p>
<p>不過爲提高物價而購買黃金，究否能達目的尚成問題，若欲金騰貴以壓美元價格，因而提高物價，須顧慮到兩種不同的情形。如果歐洲金本位集團繼續能存，誠可由滙兌低落以剌激物價之上昇。但若歐洲金本位集　一旦崩潰，放棄全本位制度，則美元反有騰貴的危險。照客觀的情勢觀察，美如堅持其買金政策，金本位集　之放棄金本位總是難免的。然而美國並不是没有顧到這點。美國正希望法國放棄金本位以期全世界的通貸膨脹。美國停止金本位後物價騰貴率早以凌駕滙兌低落率之上（七月物價指數爲一○三，較三月高二八％，七月的美元則僅低落二二％）八月以後物價之下落，其原因大半在物價向滙兌之進應。所以美國如　繼續提高物價，非盡力再壓低美元價值不可。爲此也就顧不到其他問題了。</p>
<p>Ｘ　Ｘ　Ｘ</p>
<p>十月二十九日美國發表購買黃金後，好像在世界金融市塲上投了一顆炸彈。蓋在國内買金，美元雖下落，僅足與國外諸國貨幣以不安。一旦收買海外黃金，不僅美元下落，且使各國現金向美國集中，根本危害各國金融市場，我們試看美買金前後的英美滙兌與金價格的趨勢：</p>
<p>月日　英國金價　美國金價　英美滙兌</p>
<p>先令　元</p>
<p>十月廿四日　一二八·０一　二九·八０　四·七七二五</p>
<p>廿五日　一三０·０一　三一·三六　四·七三二五</p>
<p>十一月一日　一三一·０九　三二·二六　四·八０一二五</p>
<p>二日　一三三·０三　三二·三六　四·八四五</p>
<p>三日　一三三·０二　三二·五七　四·八四一二五</p>
<p>四日　一三二·０四　三二·六七　四·八六二五</p>
<p>五日　一三一·一０　三二·八四　四·八九二五</p>
<p>六日　一二九·一一　三二·八四　四·九一</p>
<p>十月二十五日美國買金價格爲三一·三六元·較二十四日高一·五六元，此後逐步增高，英美滙兌亦逐步上昇，十一月五日超過四·八七的舊平價，當時盛傳英美滙兌比率成立。六日證實了不確，美金價爲三三·○五，英美滙兌爲四·九七元，前天（十二月五日）的滙兌仍在平價以上（五·一二元）。</p>
<p>從英國方面看來是英鎊騰貴，英鎊騰貴能使英國通貨收縮，産業萎縮，失業增加，正是英國所難容忍的，英國統制匯兌的工具爲滙兌平衡基金，假如英鎊繼續騰貴，英國必以平衡基金來壓低，這樣英美就不免有一番競爭了。二十七日美國買價三一·七六，合英金一三五先令二辨士，倫敦金價低百卅一先令二辨士，相差四先令，照此情形，英國非提高金價，則倫敦金市將全被吸收。這樣迫得英國也跟着美國走同一的路，减低鎊價，膨脹通貨。</p>
<p>Ｘ　Ｘ　Ｘ</p>
<p>英鎊美元均演過了跌落的悲劇，法郎能否避免這悲　是頗可擬　的。我們知道美買金后立場最困難的不用說是法國。英國已停止金本位，可以利用匯兌平衡基金來壓低英鎊，法國仍墨守金本位，决不能自主的低落法郎的價值。法國每年擁有百億法郎的赤半預算，與年約百億法郎的入超，雖說準備金十分充足，爲國民經清的利益起見，似乎非放棄金本位不可。財政上百億法郎的赤字與貿易上百億法郎的入超已很足動摇法郎的基礎，就是百分之百的準備金，在美國買金政策之下，也是難爲　障的工具。我們試看十月二十八日紐約與巴黎的金價格：</p>
<p>紐約　三一·八元</p>
<p>巴黎　三○·八元</p>
<p>其間相差一元大西洋金輪送費每翁司不過美元六分，在這樣的差類下，法蘭西銀行的準備金還保得住嗎？</p>
<p>美國買金政策决不能一時中止，亦卽美元下跌的程度尚未有止境，因爲美國還未達到貨幣價值的最低標準，這點可以下表與標準來推測：</p>
<p>美元金量　滙兌跌落率　金價格　金增價百分率</p>
<p>Ａ法定平價　二三·二丨丨　二○·七　丨丨</p>
<p>Ｂ百法郎＝六元　一五·二三五　三一·六　五三</p>
<p>Ｃ全美農民會議之减低限度　一五·五　四三　三六·二　七五</p>
<p>Ｄ總統减低權限　一一·六　五○　四一·四　一○○</p>
<p>照上表看來，目前美國通貨價值纔走副Ｂ階叚，據最近情勢，美國正向ＣＤ二階叚進行，如果美元落人ＣＤ二階叚中，則紐約與巴黎的金價相差將有五六元之巨，法國非停止金本位，將何以禁金流出呢？</p>
<p>法郎不僅受美元正面的攻擊，還有英鎊的側面攻擊，假使英國對英法匯兌以一鎊合八○法郎的價格定住，則美元走人ＣＤ二階叚時，英美匯兌將跌至五·五九或六元三分一，這决非英國所願意的。英國爲自已起見，祇好離開法郎跟着美元走，利用平衡基金安定英美匯兌，則美元達ＣＤ二階叚時，英法滙兌將跌至七○法郎或六二法郎，這樣法郎又受了英鎊的壓迫。</p>
<p>美元與英鎊的夾攻，必然使法國入超的傾這更爲嚴重，國際借貸惡化，國内經濟萎縮，這樣就非停止金本位不可了。</p>
<h3 id="c264">蘇俄之社會保險事業楊先垿 <a href="#c264" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e264" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">264</a></h3>
<p>蘇俄之社會保險事業·係根據一九二二年所通過之勞工法，卽於該年之十一月十五日起實施。對於聯邦中其他共和國家亦同樣適用之。最初社會保險，係對於一般工人因身體上受到危險，方得享受，但至一九三○年。失業者亦得享用。此事業之行政，完全操於商業聯合會之手，其基金則係出自各個工人。今試將其事業範圍，行政，基金來源，及分配方法，分述於後。</p>
<p>（一）事業範圍社會保險範圍甚廣，凡支取工資之工人不問其受雇之久暫，及其性質，更不問其報償之方法爲何，均得享受。但養老金之實行較緩，且係逐步推行，一九二七年紡織業已有，其他基本工業。於一九二九年方發給，及至一九三二年，各業均已照樣發給，惟臨時受僱之工人則除外。所有由一九二四年至一九三二年被保險之人數有如下表；</p>
<p>年份　被保險之人數</p>
<p>一九二五　六，七○○，○○○</p>
<p>一九二六　八，二○○，○○○</p>

<p>一九三○　一二，七○○，○○○</p>
<p>一九三一　一七，一五○，○○○</p>
<p>一九三二　二○，七○○，○○○</p>
<p>保險人數，在一九二五年，爲六百七十萬，至一九三二年，增至二千零七十萬，數年之間，急增至三倍有餘，不可不謂發達之速也。（二）行政摡况蘇俄社會保險事業行政之特質，可得而述者，卽其對各種危險均採同一之方法，及基金之管理，與商業聯合會有特殊之關係。於一九三一年前，各種行政，均操於由商業聯合會所選出代表組成委員便之手。其基金係一地方各業共有，僅有運輸一業之工人，係由本業基金保險。但至一九三一年後，此種地方組織之制度，大加改革。爲謀復興經濟及促進五年計到之各種工業均設有本業基金，如銅鐵業，機器業，煤鑛業，煤油業，化學工業，及運輸業，均分别成立。其他各業之工人，則仍由各業地方基金充之。至今年六月二十三日，由蘇聯中央執行委員會頒令，將各種地方基金完全取消，保險事業之行政，付與商業聯合會之中央委員會及其附屬之商業機關管理之。一九三一年由七種本業保險基金保險之工人達五百三十一萬六千餘人，至各業地方基金雖由一九二四年之六百三十四種減爲一九二九年之四百零一種，但其後又漸增加。當一九三二年時各種基金共有三千二百零九種，其中一千一百四十七種係本業基金，二千零六十二種係各業地方基金。計被保之人數達六百九十一萬二千八百十人，其中三百四十五萬八千一百六十九係屬於各業保險基金，三百四十五萬八千六百四十一人，歷於地方保險基金。</p>
<p>（三）基金之來源基金之來源，係由各個組成工人籌集而得其比率，一般工作者與農人不同，一般工人繳納此項基金之比率，又可分三種：</p>
<p>（一）普通比率，凡一般的事業及無特定比率者，均屬之。更以各種事業其危險程度不一，更分爲四類，第一類納工資百分之十六，第二類百分之十八，第三類百分之二十，第四類百分之二十二。（二）優益比率，凡係由地方或國家支出費用之機關的工作者及郵電與國家農塲等屬之，此種又分爲三類，第一類納工資百分之十，第二類百分之十二，第三類百分之十四。（三）特殊比率，凡各種建築事業等屬之。至於農人所繳納此項基金之比率，則以經濟與社會狀况之不同，可分三類，第一類中農納百分之二十二，第二類集體農塲者納百分之十，第三類貧農納百分之六。各種受僱者除納此項基金以作保險外，更有房屋建造基金（其比率由百分之·七六至一·六五）及訓練建築房屋人員基金之繳納。</p>
<p>試以表列示自一九二五年至一九三一年此等基金之總數及每一被保險者可得而分配之數。年份　基金總數（百萬盧布）分配數（盧布）</p>

<p>一九三一　三、四六三·三　一四三·六三</p>
<p>上表中一九三一者，僅前九月之數。據預計之數，一九三二年當爲三十五萬萬三千四百萬盧布，一九三三年預計者爲四十四萬三千一百萬。</p>
<p>（四）保險金之領取有下列之情形可享用保險基金，（一）因工作而受傷害暫時失其工作能力或永久失去工作能力者（二）年老力衰者（三）死亡（四）失業。</p>
<p>保險金不盡以現金支給，尚有實物，實物中尚有醫藥用品，此係聯邦中七共和國之不共衛生委員會能供給，凡曾保險者及無工作力能者與年老者及其家屬，均得享受。其經費一部，係由國家及地方上籌得，并有醫院，看婦，及適當食物等之供給，自一九三○年後此項費用，及其來源有如下表。（單位百萬盧布）</p>

<p>一九三一　一、三○六　五一○·○　三九·一</p>
<p>一九三二　一、九一六　七七二·五　四○·三</p>
<p>現金之支出，依左列條件而分别支給之（一）暫時失去工作能力者丨最初，凡暫時失去工作能力者，在不能工作時期内照常給以全部工資，自一九二九年後稍加變更，係以其所在業之性質，及本人在本業工作之長久而殊。譬如在社會事業方面工作者，若在本業工作三年以上，則自第一日起卽給以全部工資，在工業及運輸方面工作者，前五日僅能得工資四分之三，至第六日起乃給以全部工資，至於女子因生産關係而不能工作者，則産前産後之八星期工資均照給。</p>
<p>（二）額外之利益尚有三種：Ａ凡女子生産，於相尚時期内另給以津貼，在一九三二年以所在地之不同，津貼之數由十六至三十盧布。一九三二年後改定最少亦需爲三十二盧布·Ｂ哺養費用，於一定時期另給之，一九三二年前每月給與四至八盧布，期爲九月，其後改爲一次　給四十五盧布。Ｃ安葬費，凡曾保險者於死後另給安葬費二十一盧布至四十五盧布，以死者所在地情形之不同而異，但自一九三二後，一律改定在城市者爲四十盧布，在鄕問者爲二十盧布。</p>
<p>（三）永遠失去工作能力者丨凡永遠失去工作能力者，可依其朱去能力之程度分别之爲三類，第一類全部失去能力且需人照看者，第二類全部失去能力者，旣不能在原有業内工作，又不能在他業工作者，第三類不能在原有業内工作，但尚有一部分能力足以作一部份的工作或其他較易爲之工作者，一九三二年前因工作意外而致不能工作者，以後一種爲最多，前二種較少，但自一九三二年後此三種完全廢止，另改爲下列二種。</p>
<p>Ａ非因工作發生意外而不能工作者，在一九三二年對於此種之補助金，緣以其失去能力之多少，所在業工資之多少，及其所住之地方情形而定其數量，自一九三二年對於此種補助金之多少，改爲以被保險人所在業之地位重要如何及其服務該業之久暫而决定，如一失去工作能力者係眼務於礦業，則可得其原來工資百分之六十九（最多者），且以其服務在十年以上故另加百分之二。（由十年至十八年加百分十二，由十八年至二十三年加百分之三，）總共可得其原來工資百分七十一。若失去一部工作能力者，并服務在十八年以上，則可得其原來工資百分之三十，再每年加以百分之·五（由十八年以上至三十四年每多服務一年加百分之·五）故此種最多者能得其原來工資百之四十一。ＸＸＢ因工作發生意外而不能工作者，在一九三二年前係給以原來工資百分之十至百分之百。但其後凡屬旣失去工作能力而又需人照看者，給以原資之全數。對於僅失去全部能力或一部能力者，則與非因工作意發生而不能工作者同。（四）養老金丨養老金給與，凡男子服務滿二十五年而年齡又在六十以上者，及女子服務滿二十年而年齡在五十五以上者，一九三二年係以所在地之不同，而給與原工資百分之五十至一百之養老金，自一九三二年後則改爲以保險者所在業之不同，而給以原工資百分之五十至六十。</p>
<p>（五）撫卹費丨凡非因工作意外而致死之工人，對於其家屬·應給與撫卹金·在城市中依請求者之多少，而給以原資三分之一或四分之三。在鄕間亦依請求者之多少，每月給以五盧布半至二十八盧布。自一九三二年後，此項撫卹金改變爲百分之五十至一百二十五，凡因工外意外而致死之工人對於其家屬更應給以撫卹金，其金額在城市者依請求者之多少，給以死者原工資三分之一以至四分之三不等，在鄕間農材工作者撫卹金每月由七盧布至四十七盧布。</p>
<p>此外在一九三零年十月前對於失業者，尚有補助金，今則早已取銷矣。丨十一，二十八</p>

<h3 id="c274">爲徵收遺産稅進一解 <a href="#c274" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e274" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">274</a></h3>
<p>— 非人</p>
<p>據近日電傳，財政當局，正在計劃徵收遺産稅。施行方法，不久即將實現、遺産稅在各國，原爲直接稅之一，在國家財政上，很佔重要地位。但是無論各國那一種絶妙的善良制度，若一行到我國來，就要糟，就要變枳，這是百試百騐的成績。</p>
<p>就遺産稅而論，眞正有錢的人，情願倒貼利息，去存放外國銀行。若一聞遺産稅實行，存放到外國銀行去的，必然更爲踴躍。而能徵收得到的，只有中下等資産階級，如特别有勢力有金錢的人們，本來國法　不及。這樣一來，只有替外國銀行家大做其好生意，而對於國家實際上，反得不到若何利益，這是顯而易見的事。</p>
<p>這一點，我不過就徵收遺産稅制度上，而作一種假定的預測。其實創行一種制度，一方面爲國家着想，另一方面，天然更要爲人民着想。若徵收遺産稅，祇有爲國家着想，而没有爲人民着想。倘　要雙方顧到，兩利並存，就是非廢除遺産制不可，其中緣故，恕我吸完香烟，慢慢說來。</p>
<p>多錢爲子孫的害，歷史和現實的社會上昭告我們的事實，原是舉不勝舉。所謂高粱文繡之中，决無子弟。古人說：「積錢以與子孫，不若積德以與子孫。」又說：「積錢以與子孫，不若敎子一經。」勞實說句話，積錢以與子孫，不是爲子孫造福，乃是爲害子孫，古人如「螢火」的肚皮，早已看得熌亮。</p>
<p>古人所說的話，雖是不差，但僅僅偏面的爲子孫着想，而没有澈底的爲自已着想。你看現在世界上的人，都是强兇覇道，予取予求，刻薄寡恩，掊克聚歛，無所不用其極。積了數十萬家私不算，定要積幾百萬，積了幾百萬家私不算，還要積幾千萬，充乎其量，非欲盡刮天下的財産於一已不可。這樣「棺材裏伸出手來死要」的人，可以說舉目皆是。</p>
<p>我要問，所積幾百萬幾千萬之中，自已能享用的到底有幾分之幾。俗語說得好，「兩手一攤一些不拿」，那怕你黃金積得高與北斗，總是無法搬運到地府去罷，結果原是爲了孫做了一世牛馬，做了一場大夢。在子孫呢驕奢淫逸，以至於墮落，否則爭奪遺産，甚至骨肉分離，或者還要給小老婆去貼漢子。眞是搜刮脧削的錢財，斷無常保之理。故孔子曰：放於利而行多怨。</p>
<p>試問做墨吏爲何？做漢奸爲何？做奸商爲何？做一切損人利已之事又爲何？一言蔽之，無非爲子孫而已。若廢除遺産制，到是對症發藥，釜底抽薪的辦法，故我謂與其徵收遺産稅，還是廢除遺産制度，較爲允當。</p>
<h3 id="c275">上海黯淡面 <a href="#c275" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e275" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">275</a></h3>
<p>— 雯</p>
<p>溺於享樂的有閑階級所認識的上海，只是那浮現在外表，加了「文明」和「秩序」之粉飾的一面。從這一面所反映出來的，只是用「揮金如土」的生活方式所換取之關於衣，食，住，行，性，娱樂各方面的滿足和陶醉。例如：一九三四年的豔裝，召元到二三十元一份的大菜，一日數十，甚至百金，具備東西各國風格的大飯店房間，華麗輕快的摩托卡，滑膩顫動的大腿和乳房，可以聽取世界音波的收音機，光華濃淡的里虹燈，以及一切享受無窮的聲色狗馬之好，在這「東方巴黎」的上海，都是美俱難併的預備着。問題只是在；您爺們的錢袋，是否充實？</p>
<p>但是，這容納　　多英華洋人口約上海，荷包裏「麥克麥克」的外國人「高等華人」，畢竟是絶對的少數；而百分之九十以上，墮入饑餓線和奴隸層的「下等人」，却都是過着滴血，流汗，掙扎，等死的生活。所以，在每一頁金迷紙醉的都會生活的「光明面」，都參夾着悲慘嚴重，不堪想像的黯淡面。我們透視着這天堂地獄，咫尺霄壞的生活對照，不但要感到都市生活現狀的不合理，同時也會聯想到那數量太少，質量太劣的社會享樂層之未來的，可怕的命運。</p>
<p>在華懋飯店，匯中飯店或禮查飯店上出雲霄的華屋裏面，可以遠眺天邊，可以下瞰塵寰；窗門以内，炎夏則有冷氣電風，冬令又有水汀電爐。這種塲合，當然要算上海生活的「洞天福地」了。然而在窗外不過幾丈或十幾丈距離的附近就有無數的苦力在輪船取重機的「軋軋轤轤」聲下，裝上卸下地搬運着笨重的貨物，他們一面在喘息「吭唷」，一面在忍受着工頭的叱咜或「火腿」；同時那工頭的「尊臂」，又往往是蹺着在凖備接受「來路火腿」。這與上述大飯店裏面的生活，不過是一片玻璃之隔的兩幅南北極的圖書啊！</p>
<p>如果有人因爲看到上海殺人綁票奸淫盜刦的案件層出不窮；就以爲這龐大的都會是缺乏「治安」和「秩序」，那也許是他的「錯誤」。「秩序」是不能求之於工廠區域，或貧民窟的；要看上海的「秩序」，須到卡爾登靜安寺路轉角，霞飛路邁爾西愛路口和亞爾培路那些地方去考察。每當電影散塲，回力球和跑狗起賽或完塲的時候，都有加崗的華洋巡捕在那裏騙逐「閑人」，鞭撻黃包車夫，安排大批汽車之魚貫的行列。卡爾登新光或大光明，一天三度地把幾千個多少帶了紳士氣派的老幼男女吞吐着，每當八點半或十一點散場的時候，環繞在這三大戲院週園的幾條馬路上的每一角落裏，却滿佈着竊聽你的口音而襲撤來認「同鄕」，討銅板的癟三和拉不着「生意」就要回去吃「生活」的娼妓。在中央運動塲和「立體建築」的國泰大戲院遥遥相望，充滿了「異國情調」和「神秘氣味」的霞飛路上，除了ＨailHail之洋流氓的賭博和香艶肉感的電影而外，就有經常减價，一塊錢可以來蒸，洗，擦，摩四樣的「按摩院」和和種樣的羅宋秘窟。在那神秘的街頭，隨時可以遇到羅宋癟三，翹起大姆指向你呌着「中國人，大好老」！的口號，換一兩個銅板。讀者諸君！你要記着：這些「可憐」而又活該的羅宋男女們，在彼得格勒「王氣未收」的時代，都是最長於驕奢淫樂的「享福之人」啊！越過那莊嚴的嵩山路捕房，介乎大自鳴鐘以西的一大段，就是許多「雲膏大放盤」的營紥，韓莊大本營；東西新橋大世界一帶，更是五步一崗，十步一哨的「娘子軍」硬拉或硬抬「阿土生」的「警戒線」。以上這「些魑魅魍魎」的玩意兒，都是和眉的建築物及繁榮的商業一樣，公開陳列在馬路之上，完全是人間地獄，豈止都會黯淡面而已！</p>
<p>靜黃寺，愚園路一、帶的梧油路長微應不染，各種别墅，弄堂是那樣的整齊華貴，但附近曹家渡、一帶的工廠區域，無數鳩形鵠面。胼手胝足的男女工人，却是經常呼吸着充滿煤烟的空氣，住着以六尺見方的空間完成「吃，喝，睡，拉」等手續的鴿子籠。試遠一些，在太陽廟和閘北青雲路一帶的棚户，更是把稻草木屑當着建築材料，把大餅油條當作珍貴食品。如果一遇到「天不睜眼」的災禍，一把火或一陣北風就可以把他們弄得寸草不留，人亡家破！然而工人和棚户的數量，都是多過住闊公館大飯店的豪富們幾十倍呀！</p>
<h3 id="c276">漫談友誼 <a href="#c276" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e276" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">276</a></h3>
<p>— 葬</p>
<p>丨丨獻呈一蘋兄丨丨</p>
<p>出乎意料的，老父過世後，慌亂中我寫的那篇不成文的「愴痛的心」，竟邀獲了你的眞誠慰藉！其實，這何書是出乎意料，平日習讀你的小品與長篇，一字字都是眞誠的流露！是兩三月以前了吧，你連篇的發表過記述你的朋友的病狀，寫自已是怎樣的爲朋友關切波奔，寫一個新交菲是怎樣的磊落，都使人看了感到輕鬆凉爽，感到創傷的生命彷彿湔滌一新了。就是在我們曾僅一面的把晤中，你給予我的印象，也是十分深致，談吐的直捷，表情的純眞，深沈而銳利的眼色丨丨丨一切的一切呀！就因爲這樣，所以獨你能知一位曾僅一面的新朋友的「愴痛的心」。不過我因爲看慣了一般人的面像的猙獰，應用我的常度，驟然間看到你的文字，眞不免有些驚訝，以爲是出乎意科。這，固然是我的無法掩護的歉疚，也實是我們相聚的機會太少的原故。</p>
<p>因爲這，引動了我對於友誼的一番認識在這社會，無論在那個角裏，一般的友誼，可分三種：一是虚僞的友誼，就是死臉裝成活臉，油腔滑調的一味敷衍：二是利害的友誼，有利則合、則親愛，有害則離，則疏遠，這友誼的漲落，完全是以利害爲尺度，一忽兒烘做像火漆一團，一忽又似冰炭之相尅；三是獰笑的友誼，在這資本主義的社會裏，一切的形態，本來都是獰笑的扮演，在友誼上也就免不了這種模型，多少人是在獰笑中你來我去。這三種友誼的缺陷，就是欠缺「眞誠」，簡直可以說，找不出一絲的眞誠，彼此往來的紐帶，全是虚僞，利害，獰笑。這是可惡的現實社會的反映，也就是整個人類生命的創傷，我們感覺不了這創傷的侵襲，我們需要眞誠的友誼。站在某種社會意識上說，所謂眞誠之友誼，彷彿是末節小事，用不着這麽獻頌。然而我的性子就這麽註定了，深深的感覺，人類不僅是理智的動物，而且是感情的，理智要有感情去潤澤，生命才能充實豐肥。因之，我常常恐懼生命的飢荒，我急切的渴求着眞誠的友誼的灌救。</p>
<p>活了二十三歲來了的我，在朋友力量的方面講，雖不算多，但也不少；可是有許多使我失望，使我畏却，因爲他們率以一般的友誼相施，我接近去，我就侷促，我就心傷！我要擺脫這些，追求那些。兩年來跳出學校，爬進社會，生活雖然處處碰壁，却私幸遇上了幾位平生所渴求的眞誠的朋友，我們的往來，完全擺脫了虚僞，利害，獰笑的死殼，全都站在眞誠的友誼道上携手前進，這，使我感到人類的可愛，生之足戀，今後我的生活，就全以此策進！</p>
<p>不待說，你又是我所渴求的一個了！你已成了我的生命上的一朶鮮花！可不知你願不願意？我有些膽怯；因爲我的本身很貧乏，我的生命太狹窄！也就因爲這點，所以我不敢輕爾去攀找新朋友，也就是我們「一面」之後，至今我還不曾去會過你，也不曾通過信。可是今朝，我已深深的認識了你，也許你與我有同樣的意向丨丨需要我這樣下級的朋友，那麽，朋友，我們在眞誠的友誼道上携手前進吧！</p>
<p>最後，感謝你的慰藉，故鄕不是屬於我的，要回到了那裏，那裏才是我的故鄕，而且也並不多遠；老父過世了，我當在他遺留給我的生命上尋求報答！同時我奉勸老兄一聲：你也不要以二歲就死了父親而再悲傷喲！</p>
<h3 id="c277">駡 <a href="#c277" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e277" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">277</a></h3>
<p>— 一蘋</p>
<p>咱們貴國是自稱文明古國於世界，所以對於駡的藝術也特别研究；從小孩子時候在人家墨黑的牆們上寫「ＸＸＸ正正不好也」及「ＸＸＸ小五車」起，以至駡人「走狗」「叛逆」……宣布「十大罪狀」等，階級繁多，不勝備載。至於駡駡他人的祖宗八代和生殖器，更是小焉者也，無足論矣！</p>
<p>鄙人的姓氏，或者和某一位名作家姓名讀音略微相同的緣故，曾級人駡過照摸屁股牌頭。雖然我寫過一篇聲明，過後很後悔，無論我　說得「一蘋」二字和我有二十五年的緣分，姓張更因爲祖上相傳，未入贅她姓，是無可辦法的事。但是聲明　管聲明，要駡還是駡你。豈非多寫一篇聲明，多挨駡幾句？不過　們費了這末許多精神來打趣一位無名小卒，或者是蕭老頭子到上海作的孽吧！</p>
<p>今年在本刊上多寫了幾篇「戀愛的故事」，又在我這個住亭子間的酸小子的頭上加個小布爾喬亞的頭銜。本來像我們這般没有生得好八字的，對於小布爾喬亞的生活是求之不得。寫文章（？）不過是想騙稿費，「戀愛的故事」也好，亂千百糟也好，塡滿了原稿紙，經過編輯先生的大目，再從手民排成鉛字，印到報紙上，就算了事，寫的什麽東西，也不希望印什麽單行本，一千字變成三塊錢，他無所來！而這惡意的恭維小布爾喬亞，我是没有福份接受的，敬以奉璧那位先生。</p>
<p>最近的「上海」在本刊登載了。筆名老三，除了本刊的編輯先生和我的知已朋友，没有第三種人知道的。在兩禮拜以前，我接到一封信，是從我們的電台通訊處轉來的，没有署名。寫信的人就像駡人家祖宗八代似的臭駡我一頓，最後質問我上海中徐慧琴爲什麽寫成那樣典型的一個女性，於是我神經過敏，那位寫信的先生（？）是爲我理想中的徐慧琴來辯護的。但是他（？）能知道老三是我的筆名，當然不出第一第二兩種人範圍之内，我曾詢問過本刊的編輯先生，回答是没有人來打聽老三倒底是誰；不過我的知已朋友呢，我相信没有那樣無聊的人，强變了字跡，埋没了姓名，和我開那末一個玩笑。我希望那位寫信的先生（？）給我一個見面的機會，我想親自來領敎，或者可以使先生（？）痛快一點，不知先生（，）以爲何如？</p>

<p>— 貝</p>
<p>我的朋友，不是胡適之，而是囚禁在監獄裏的曼。</p>
<p>「一二八」的前夜，我們還見過面，痛談過時事，自東洋兵那麽隨隨便便的衝擊一夜後，我們都跌下了恐怖的深淵，幾天中就斷了會面的聯繫。某一天在馬路上邂逅着龍，他急促的說：「曼倒有了着靠，他有一個信給你。」當時我眞奇之又奇，時機是這樣恐怖，他是那麽孤傲的一幅性子，怎能找到着靠呢？不由得我吐出了「不要瞎說！」「你購啦，這就是他呌我轉給你的信，看裏面寫的什麽？」龍認眞的說，同時就把曼的那麽歪七歪八寫的一葉信紙掏出給我：</p>
<p>「朋友，想不到幾天不見面，我們就隔了一個世界！三十日的深夜，我本打算在凡那兒擠着睡的，偏偏他的幾位女戚逃來了，於是我不得不另外想辦法：走出來，剛剛到□□□路□□□路轉角，便破着兩位巡捕老爺，喝令我止步，隨着更將我的身上大肆搜查，連胯下都給他們抓了幾把，結果在貼肉的汗衫袋裏搜着我的日記本和幾封毫無關係的朋友的信，於是他們就說，在此戒嚴期内，頗有嫌疑，就把我帶進了捕房，再提到法院，更不由分說的以危害民國罪判定了我五年徒刑。朋友，你們應爲我想想辦法呵！」</p>
<p>「呵，原來如此，寃屈，寃屈，眞是寃屈丨不過倒確實也是暫時的一個着靠！」我這才領會龍的意思，也就是樣口吻的給曼的寃屈的遭過屬進去一句贊美。</p>
<p>「眞的是不要再呶閒嘴了，究竟不是好玩的，我們同去找律師給也上訴吧！」龍性急了，我們便一同去找昔日的一位老師，老師便給我們介紹了一位律師，我們把事實陳明過後，律師連連的摇頭問：「他家堆好麽？」「不大好！」律師又連連的摇頭說：「那可困難了！是政治犯啦！政治犯没有錢……」餘下的是皺眉一笑。左講右講，才講定以一百元相煩，律師才吞吞吐吐的答應：「只得莫算那麽許多了。」這，使我們興奮極了，好像曼就立現在我們的跟前。我們就寫信到曼的家裏去，說他病的很重，須設法寄一百元來醫治。</p>
<p>曼要我去看他，那眞天曉得，上午九時就去，直等到十二時半才給我們在一個菜碗大的鐵栅洞口，隔壁相會，我們看不出面像，只能熟聽聲音，曼說：「貝，是你來了，第一我告訴你，看守所的賬房，搭去了老子五塊錢的油，請你給我去交涉！……」監視的法警便大發起雷霆：「犯人還不守規矩，隨口駡人，取消會客！」「Ｘ你娘，Ｘ你娘！」曼在牢裏駡得更兇，限定的五分鐘一忽就這樣混過去了，可說我們根本没有談什麽話。</p>
<p>走出來，很惱怒的我便去找看守所的賬房，他們竟給一個不理。</p>
<p>其後，一個後長的時間長没　　寄出來，我也爲了生活的忙迫，只給他送去了一些食物和書報。是去年冬季了才又得到也一個信，他說：「上訴又判下來了，仍舊是五年，五塊錢仍是被措油舊底了，一些食物只收到一瓶辣油，書報全然没有遞到，」從這裏可以使我們後悔一百元的律師上訴費，恰像丢在河裏，連泡沫都没有起一個呢。最近曼傳出來的訊息，使我非常興奮，他說他再不同那些狗子們鬥什麽法了，他也暫時不想伸寃，不夢想什麽减刑特赦，他現在在安心的研究學問，凖備着將來的眞正奮鬥，外國文已研究得精通一門法文了。</p>
<p>是的，曼，這是你的該當的處置！有一條命，再有的是奮鬥工具，短短的五年過去了，仍是你的天下！此次雖然你遭寃屈，也就是你的眞實人生的肇始！當前，這世界，原是一座龐大的監獄，丨朋友，忍耐！努力！奠定你出獄以後旋翻時代的基礎！（完）</p>

<p>「唔？」高飛突然站住了脚。</p>
<p>「什麽？」</p>
<p>「你没有知道？」</p>
<p>「誰知道！」</p>
<p>「都是敏的錢啊！我們　朋友可以帮你多大的忙！」</p>
<p>「唔。」我們維續向前走去，路上拖着長長的人影，秋風吹着路旁的樹葉作響，秋不知不覺已愉上了牠的征途。</p>
<p>（三十二）謝謝你</p>
<p>我不敢自信一個從繼母手下逃亡出來的流浪漢，沉迷在兩個不同典型的女性包圍中。我記起夢見父親，那嚴肅的臉，那嚴肅的聲音。雖然我没有離開我的弟弟，但是這般的生活，豈是我脫離故鄕時所希望的。兩個月床上的纒綿，已是我不可聲辯的事實。「你已被女人圍上了！」那嚴肅的父親的聲音永遠牢記在我的心頭。</p>
<p>一個天高氣爽的早晨，我接到了一封表姊遣人送來的信，舅父的事要我到徐家匯去。我似乎很慚恧，在上海將近一年，身上的舊棉袍是更形破舊了。如其那門房老是扮着上司見下屬的臉倒是很好的，我眞怕見在形式上他比我高上萬倍的謙卑的少爺；然而這或者是表姊說的我們年青人的機會，我要逃避現實的包圍，先得脫離正誼社的牢籠。</p>
<p>終於做賊似的到了方外别墅的鐵門前，好像是專等候着我，那門房的腦袋在我没有舉手按電鈴之前已扮着笑臉在我面前了，不過那聲高聲的少爺是被鬼鬼祟祟的話語他替了。當我側身踏進鐵門，他輕輕的俯身在我身畔說：</p>
<p>「少爺，請先到客廳裏，小姐等候着。」</p>
<p>我望了他一眼，他裝着笑臉回進門房去了。懷着鬼胎，走完石砌的甬道，洋房門首表姊跳了出來，像一隻可愛的小花貓，樣。她挽了我的手，走進客廳裏，開頭第一句：「坐一會，父親還没有起身。」</p>
<p>「就是這個理由？」</p>
<p>「不！」一枝烟同着一個媚人的微笑同時送過來「爸爸最近做了一筆買賣，賺進了幾萬，他天天快活得什麽似的，他答應我買一個戒子。我說你到上海將近一年，還是覊居在朋友家裏，着天更生了一次大病，爸爸替他安置一個位子吧。」</p>
<p>「謝謝你。」我感覺這也没有什麽值得大驚小怪的。</p>
<p>「誰要你謝呢！」慧姊將皮鞋躁的地板怪響「我要先對你說一說，别兩個人的話說來兩樣的。」一種滿意的微笑是無論如何掩飾不個的。</p>
<p>「那更要謝謝你！」</p>
<p>「别晚囌了，見爸爸去罷。」</p>
<p>「舅舅没有起床？」</p>
<p>「應該起來了。」慧姊望了望壁上的掛鐘，「不是十一點鐘了嗎。」</p>
<p>我望着她的臉，覺得我這一次到方外别墅是從這一個牢籠逃出來進别一個牢籠。</p>

<p>— 沙基</p>
<p>十（二）「除夕」導演姜起鳳（上）</p>
<p>記得當「除夕」在北京大戲院第一次開映時，大家都因之驚奇。不僅是有些畫面的構圖很美，而故事的結構，能在很短的時間過程中，創作一萬呎上下的影片，的確不易。與此同類的，我們可舉出「大飯店」或英國的「羅馬快車」，還有最近馬上到來的的美高梅的「八點鐘的晚餐」等。而明星公司的「二十四小時」（沈西苓導演）也是如此。……</p>
<p>「除夕」是不會使我們忘懷的。因此，我便至聯華一廠，訪問這位作者了。　　在小巧的會客廳中，我們二人面前各有一杯濃茶。我們抽着烟，白色的烟雲，在我們頭上繚繞。壁角的黃菊花已經彫謝了，隱藏在黑暗的角落中不敢動顫，灰白色的光芒自屋頂的天窗中瀉下來，使我個人感覺空氣的嚴肅。</p>
<p>姜先生穿着一件眞正國貨的布棉袍，脚下穿的也不過是一元八角的翻鞋，其樸素的風度，首先使我感動。當我聲明來意之後，他是滿口謙恭。他首先說明他不會說「官話」，於是我也間或操着上海口音和他談話了。</p>
<p>我們的談話是同答式的。我說：「姜先生對於日前的中國電影，有什麽意見？」</p>
<p>「我個人的意見以爲，中國電影雖然轉變了，但是還是空虚得很。在這方面說，中國的電影從業員，是需要批評家來切實輔助的。即是說振興中國電影，一定要批評家對作者加以督促，鼓勵。這因爲旁觀者清，當局者迷的原故。……」</p>
<p>「不過目前事實上又臨到一個似乎嚴重的時期，有些作家免不了要開倒車，不知先生取什麽態度？」</p>
<p>「這很難說。……也許我的意志是很薄弱的。……不過我總肯定地想電影是不能離開大衆的。我們總得做在衆所需要的東西。凡是大衆所需要的東西，我們得大膽的做去。」</p>
<p>在笑嘻嘻的謙恭之中，他隱約着堅决的態度。其後我又問：「關於你自已的作品，請說一點。」</p>
<p>「這，老實說，對於自已的作品都不滿意。計算起來，我在電影界，已有十年之久，但毫無進步。開始時我是在大中華合百公司。以後在各小公司中躭擱了很久。可是小公司的環境不好，我就是在這種惡劣的環境中弄壞了的。到聯華以後，比較的可以發展。」</p>
<p>「你對於「除夕」有什麽意見？」</p>
<p>「「除夕」有着錯綜的劇情，在意義方面是不健全的。不過我拍這部戲，很有苦衷，道演很吃虧，損失不少，那時因爲大家都不拍，我自已又剛好没有劇本。」（未完）</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3 id="c281">評「野草情鴛」 <a href="#c281" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e281" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">281</a></h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>ＬadiesTheyTalkAbout</p>
<p>丨華納出品國泰開映丨</p>
<p>印象的批評，固然使讀者不滿意，而寫這種批評的朋友們丨至少是我，總覺得十分苦惱。　批評文學或是戲劇一樣，在未批評之先，一定要充分的把握着作品的全部，然後才能開始比較深刻的寫出自已的意見。但是目前的電影批評者没有這種可能，看了一遍之後便要怱怱忙忙寫文章，無論怎樣每感的人，也不能寫下十分完美的批評。這在我的確感覺十分的惶悚。我希望同一工作的朋友們，能夠想出一個較好的方法來解决這種困難。</p>
<p>譬如這一「野草情鴛」罷，又只能印象的寫出幾點十分簡單的意見。</p>
<p>（一）作者盡量的將監獄美化起來，這是最不合乎中國人之生活情感的。監獄中有花園，有漂亮的吸烟室。女囚犯們是每一個人有一個精美的房間。開留聲機，唱歌，彈琴，牆上掛着情人的相片。這决不是監獄，而是養老院啊。我想讀者諸君也許有誰願意到那兒去住上一年半載的吧。</p>
<p>然而作者是有用意的。這與主題所說的以聖經和愛情來感化罪犯，互相聯貫起來，監獄的美化，是一重要的反證。原來作者就不必顧及的描寫。</p>
<p>（二）頌揚新敎之功德，是作品主要的内容。但是我們看女主公的女盜，是否完全爲完敎所感化過來的呢？與其說神的力量感化了罪犯的心靈母寗說是那位任職於法院的新敎徒，他的熱情便她軟化了。</p>
<p>（三）然而將愛情如此誇張，也是　人不相信的。譬如說女罪犯槍傷了情人，而被傷者却能忍痛的爲其辯護而毫無怨恨。</p>
<p>而且那男主人公的個性，也是很矛盾的。我們一方面看見他激昻慷慨，儼然是一個了不起的英雄。但對於那女囚犯却如此柔順，何况　女人並没有可愛的地方。編劇者的解釋，說她具有超人的魔力。</p>
<p>（四）導演將故事清楚明白叙述出來，便是他最大的成功。不過有幾個塲面支配得好。小地方趣味化的噱頭。是美國藝人得意之筆。</p>
<p>（五）劇作者想像的確豐富。如肥皂上印鎖匙模型，洗衣箱中看信，以及搶銀行的預先佈置等。這些，對於社會是否是有益的敎訓呢？</p>
<p>好了，我能寫出的只是這些印象，如此而已。</p>
<h3 id="c282">評「新女性」 <a href="#c282" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e282" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">282</a></h3>
<p>— 摩爾</p>
<p>ＬadyWithAPast</p>
<p>「新女性」接着「摩俠吉訶德」在南京公映了「摩俠吉訶德」根據「世界文學有數的名著，經過專家之手改編而成，更集合電影聲樂的第一流人才，製作而成，他的結果，是這樣的悽慘（只映了四天），使我不得不慨嘆藝術欣賞力的獨佔，而加倍的覺得眞正大衆自已的電影製作的需要。一方面爲着希佛萊主演的男女事件影片的賣座，因而感到新的電影批評的功效的薄弱，進一步的覺得對于影片的意識，和内容所决定的形式的批評，所應該注意的地方。而深的憂慮于新的批評者，爲舊形式所迷戀着的危險（像對于舊形式有興趣的讚嘆之類。）</p>
<p>「新女性」的譯名是和其原意義很不對的，“ＬadywithAPast”本來是舞台劇，現在搬上銀幕而用喜劇的方式出現。</p>
<p>最近經過很多友人的嚴密注意的結果，美國片也逐漸放棄了純粹幻想的題材，而歸到社會現實方面來了。（華納公司的注意暴露影片，因而囊動一時，即其明證，）「新女性」無疑的是一張較爲含有現實性的影片。自然，故事仍然是男女戀愛，但已經不是才子佳人，一見傾心的了。他寫出富家女郎，怎樣會從性情沉默，而到交游廣闊，浪漫輕狂：中間是有某一種必然的關係，至少是條件的。他寫出一個英俊少年，怎樣不敢犯一端莊自守的少女，而迷戀于妖冶浪漫的蕩婦。他寫出子爵們的追求女子，是爲了「慕范（女主角）富有，思娶之可以致富。」而揭穿戀愛至上主義的面目。不但如此，他更把子爵的自殺，除了失戀以外，更加以破産的關係，使他的自殺不會使觀衆感到不可能，不現實。最好的是他寫少年和素來不十分注意的唐納結合是在經過一番人事風波以後的新覺悟。這是編劇者的成功之處。</p>
<p>至于導演方面，我覺得最成功的，是在少女少年的内心描寫。當少年心愛少女而不敢求愛時的昏亂矛盾，和妖冶的蕩婦引誘時的遲疑不决，以及明知蕩婦之爲人，而不自主的爲她的冶容所惑；都是絲絲入扣。至于少女初愛時的内心苦悶，以及經一番閱歷後的進步，和最後的躊躇，可以說没有一處不入情入理。這當然因爲他們（包括一切製作者）生活體騐的關係，而這一部影片的終于只成爲舊藝術的原因，和他的價值的有限，也在這個地方。</p>
<p>男女主角的表演，在導演指導之下，是無遣憾的做到了所需要的一切。</p>

<p>— 碧美</p>
<p>藝華公司前次在交通大學和聯華公司比賽足球，會戰數十合，最後如藝華守球門的岳楓努力一些，聯華必大敗而回！然而；雖雙方不見勝負，但藝華的球藝在電影界已得了一個「鐵軍」雅號了。</p>
<p>金燄！和龔稼農發起的電影界田徑競賽會流賽之後藝華鐵軍頓感英雄無用武之地，惟幾位運動員並不因此鬆懈，每天利用飯後餘暇，依然大加練習。</p>
<p>果然，風聲所播，激動了學界。前天（十四）大夏大學「怒吼籃球隊」率領勇將近十，啦啦隊多人，至藝華公司運動場比賽籃球，當時藝華方面精銳挑剔，得「查瑞龍，胡銳，查瑞根，王春泉，姚賡複，」五人與其交鋒。</p>
<p>時正三點二十分，藝華運動塲殺聲震天，兩軍力戰五次，大夏諸將，均駕輕就熟，各方應付，然藝華公司查瑞根非常賣力，一球著手，卽如用線縛住一般，投籃必進，蹤跳極高，結果大夏得三十三分，藝華得三十八分，大夏輸五分，時已傍晚，遂各收兵。（却酬）</p>

<p>— 素因</p>
<p>奇與一言不發地，將她抱了起來，偎緊在心頭，將她抱進屋子去了。媽嫻端了一杯湯來，後面父親和美格跟着。蓓絲看着他們微微笑着。「我想睡一回哩」她說。奇奥於是替她理着身底下的墊子，輕輕將她放了下來。蓓絲的眼睛尋着窗口的亮光，於是眼睛裏露出一絲的笑容。「你們看丨丨」她說，「我的鳥兒剛巧已經回來了。」她的頭仰過去了，她的眼睛慢慢閉了。奇奥哭着「蓓絲，」又喊着媽嬭。美格抱住了父親亦哭起來了。</p>
<p>勞萊在歐歐聽見了馬區家的哀音，就立刻千里遥遥的跑到瑞士去尋亞梅。亞梅伏在勞萊的懷裡哭了。勞萊一面安慰着她，一面說他將不離開她，直到她心上的創痕平復爲止。於是他就天天來陪着亞梅游玩。有一天他們在湖上摇着船，勞萊忽然目不轉瞬地看着她。她是多末美麗呀丨她已經長大了。從前小時候的嬌疵做作現在都已化成了自然的儀態。她全黃的髢髮　在粉面的　旁，眞是風致嫣然，加以數年來所受的一切哀愁，使她的性格更凝重端莊了。勞萊默默地對她看着，突然覺得一顆心在跳動着，好像從來没有那樣跳動過似的。</p>
<p>亞梅感覺到他的目光注射在她的身上。她說：「你倦了吧。我來替你摇摇吧。」勞萊纔如夢初醒似的，連忙說道：「我不倦，不過你要摇，我們可以一同摇着。」到了暮色昏黃的時候了，一隻船遠在湖上慢慢地摇着，兩個黑影子，在湖面蕩漾着。「我們不是摇得很好嗎？」亞梅最後開口破了長久的沉默。勞萊道：「好極了，我願意永久能這樣同舟共濟的渡着悠游的歲月」。他拿槳放下了，他柔聲的問着：「可以嗎，亞梅？亞梅皺着眉頭道：「但是勞萊」</p>
<p>，你和奇奥不是一向相愛的嗎？」勞萊道：「是的。我還是很愛她的。但愛的情形已經不同了。亞梅，那種是小孩子的愛，不能持久的。奇奥從前亦會想法子呌我明白，但那時我不要聽她的話，並且還爲她而生氣。不過奇奥是不錯的。亞梅，現在的情形不同了。我現在已經是一個成人了。你就是我的日光，希望你能永遠照耀在我的身上。亞梅，可以不可以呢？」亞梅的聲音低得都聽不見了，但是很清晰的幾個字：「可以，勞萊。」（未完）</p>

<p>(Kengzhou) Yesterday, the Central Army in Northern Fujian engaged in a skirmish with rebel troops between Jian'an and Yanping. The front lines have not yet entered a formal war period. The Central Army, not having received orders to attack, is currently holding its ground. Troops from the rear □□□□□□ and other units are now being dispatched expeditedly from □□ along the Zhejiang border to reinforce defenses. Should the rebel troops advance further, they will be met with a fierce counterattack. (Seventeenth Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hangzhou) A telegram from Quzhou states that the large Central Army has advanced towards □□, with Chiang Ting-wen in command, arranging and organizing defenses. The counties of Quzhou, Longquan, Kaihua, Changshan, Qingyuan, and Taishun are all secure. (Seventeenth Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Hangzhou) Lu Diping returned to the province at 5:00 PM today after inspecting the Zhejiang provincial border defenses. According to reports, he took the opportunity to inspect the Jiangshan border area but did not reach Xianxia Ridge. The front-line defenses are heavily fortified, and public order is consolidated. The people of Zhejiang are at peace, and business continues as usual. Moreover, the discipline of the stationed troops is very good, and there are no unusual phenomena in the region. The people are generally optimistic about the current conflict, as they deeply understand that they are fighting for the entire doctrine and the nation. Our troops stationed at □□□□□□□ have not engaged in any military action because they have not received orders from the central government. The Fujian army and the Red bandits are concentrated in Yanping, joining forces. There is factual proof of cooperation between the Fujian side and the Red bandits. (Seventeenth Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Beiping) A telegram from Zhangjiakou states that on the 14th, four or five hundred Japanese and puppet troops arrived at Dagetun from Fengning, carrying heavy artillery, machine guns, and heavy weapons. On the morning of the 15th, over a hundred Japanese troops advanced to Hongshiliang. Zhang Junjie's Fourth Detachment retreated to Longmensuo Chicheng on the evening of the 16th, and the situation is very tense. Several hundred puppet cavalry troops have also arrived in the Second District of Guyuan. It is reported that the local garrison fired warning shots. Zhang Shusheng of Guyuan was summoned to Zhangjiakou on the evening of the 16th by Song via telegram to discuss countermeasures. Zhang is scheduled to proceed to Zhangbei and then to Guyuan on the morning of the 18th. (Seventeenth Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) There are three possible purposes for the Japanese and puppet troops' current encroachment on Eastern Chahar: First, to reinforce the so-called border defenses of the puppet state. Second, to drive the puppet troops and bandits from the hot territories into Chahar territory for food. Third, to instigate the masses to expel the □□□ troops from the Chahar-Rehe border area. Song telegraphed a report stating that Japanese troops in the Datang area still have intentions to continue advancing towards Guyuan. Huang Shouchong and others are stationed in Longmen, east of Chicheng. Liu Guitang, commander of the Eastern Chahar guerrillas, has moved his headquarters to Yangtianpu. There has been no aggressive action from Japanese and puppet troops on the right flank. Military observers believe that the Eastern Chahar incident is unlikely to escalate. The troops dispatched eastward by the Japanese this time are part of the Western Right Wing of the Eighth Division, and the Suzuki Brigade from the Fengning area, numbering about a thousand, with Zhang Hai Peng's troops numbering about a thousand. Song Zheyuan has ordered his troops to strictly defend. (Seventeenth Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Chen Jiqing, the county magistrate of Zhangbei, telegraphed to Beiping this morning, stating that seven or eight hundred Japanese and puppet troops, over a hundred armored vehicles, and five aircraft arrived at Shiqidaogou, Fengning, on the 11th, 12th, and 13th. Three or four hundred arrived at Xinyingzi, Tianpinggou, and Weichenggou in the Second District of Guyuan at 4:00 PM on the 12th. It is rumored that the Japanese and puppet forces have a three-pronged plan to attack Guyuan and Xifengkou. On the evening of the 12th, our Liu Zhenyu and Ma Jinliang units clashed at Sandaogou Hongshicha. Three men from the Liu unit were killed and six were wounded. The remaining troops have retreated to Mingheng Tan, awaiting reinforcements. (Seventeenth Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Beiping) Chayama stated that he received a telegram from the Kwantung Army stating that the bandits on the Chahar-Rehe border have been suppressed, and the Japanese and Manchukuo troops are scheduled to withdraw to Fengning and Luanping tomorrow. (Seventeenth Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Chayama stated that one division of the Eighth Division of the Japanese Army and Zhang Haipeng's troops were suppressing bandits on the Rehe border and had no other actions. The matter will be completed soon, and they will retreat to Rehe, Kwantung Army absolutely has no intention of invading Chahar. (Seventeenth Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Japanese military officer Chayama spoke to reporters at noon on the 17th regarding the Eastern Chahar incident, saying that the Kwantung Army and Zhang Haipeng's troops were acting entirely for the purpose of suppressing bandits, with absolutely no other intentions. He has now received a telegram from Rehe stating that the bandits there have been suppressed, and the troops will withdraw to Luanping and Chengde, Rehe, today or tomorrow. The rumors that the Japanese army has advanced to Eastern Chahar are based on the urgency of the Russo-Japanese situation to prepare for military action against Russia, and there is also talk of large-scale action are all not true. I hope that the Chinese people will not cause any misunderstanding. I dare to assert that the Kwantung Army absolutely has no intention of invading Chahar.

<p>(Beiping) According to a certain military expert, the actions of the Japanese and puppet troops in Eastern Chahar are unlikely to escalate. The Ping authorities are currently dispatching personnel to continue investigating the truth of the matter. It is expected that these actions by the Japanese and puppet troops have no other important significance. The authorities will wait for a confirmed report before negotiating with the Japanese side through the Political Readjustment Committee. Rumors that the Japanese and puppet troops number two or three thousand and are carrying heavy artillery are actually inaccurate. It is hoped that the people of the country will remain calm and not alarm each other. (Seventeenth Central News Agency Telegram)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Shen Chang, director of the Beiping-Suiyuan Railway Bureau, completed negotiations with the Ministry of Railways and returned north.

<p>Since Germany's withdrawal from the Disarmament Conference, Franco-German relations have become increasingly strained, threatening the Treaty of Versailles. Italy has also been supporting Germany's actions, and recently openly proposed reorganizing the League of Nations to seek a new way to resolve the current situation. In fact, it is undeniable that the League of Nations is being manipulated by countries within the Versailles system. However, Germany is unwilling to remain subject to the Treaty of Versailles, and among the powerful nations in the current League of Nations, only Britain, France, and Italy remain. Although the United States was the initiator of the national self-determination movement, it has consistently refused to participate in the League of Nations to maintain the Monroe Doctrine. The Soviet Union, with a different political system, has established its own system. Japan is also unwilling to be restricted by international conventions and has withdrawn from the League of Nations. Now, Germany has once again withdrawn automatically, demanding equality in armaments. This weakens the League of Nations' actual strength and nominal appeal. However, today's Europe not only faces the crisis of arms expansion and the fear of national opposition within the League of Nations, but also experiences domestic budget deficits and personnel problems that cannot be resolved. If a fundamental way to seek peace is not found, I fear that it will not take a single bullet from Sarajevo to plunge the world back into the tragedy of 1914.</p>
<p>France believes that if the status quo can be maintained, there is hope for a bright future. Even if the League of Nations is not sacred, it can still resolve the current disputes in Europe. Germany is mired in economic panic, embracing more than five million unemployed workers. It has no spare energy to engage in purely consumptive armament construction and realize its imagined true militarism. Unexpectedly, Hitler used this to inspire his countrymen and stimulate the excitement of his industrial sector through military industrial needs. At the same time, Italy is eager to develop its national power, but it is restricted by France. The guarantor of the Treaty of Versailles, the League of Nations, serves as France's shield and an obstacle to Italy's expansion in Central Europe. Therefore, shortly after Germany's withdrawal from the League, Italy proposed reorganizing the League. This further reveals Italy's ambition to dominate. France's anxiety has increased. It must guard against the revival of the German Empire and fear Italy's unbridled actions, so it must do its best to prevent them, so that its traditional policy of "security guarantees" can truly be secure and not be subject to external threats. The more rigorous such precautions become, the more pressing the other party's precautions become. After mutual agitation, it helps to expose the crisis. The turmoil in the European political situation is based on this.</p>
<p>If the global economic panic had not deepened so much, the war would have broken out as early as the September 18th Incident. It is not only today that we can say it is dangerous. However, the current opposition among European countries has indeed become rigid and cannot be resolved on its own. If this continues, everyone can only wield their sharp swords to cut through this stalemate. However, Germany at this time is still not capable of fighting a war. Italy's strength has not been fully developed. The Soviet Union's diplomacy towards Western Europe advocates peace. Therefore, although fundamental conflicts are unavoidable, the current situation seems to be mitigable. Britain understands this situation and has risen to mediate the Franco-German dispute and the Franco-Italian opposition.</p>
<p>British Foreign Secretary Simon will take advantage of the upcoming Christmas holiday to travel around Europe and exchange political views with France, Germany, Italy, and other countries in order to break the deadlock in the Disarmament Conference. If Britain's move can succeed, Britain will make a great contribution to the future of peace. What is concerning is that Germany will never give up its demand for equality in armaments at this time, and will further demand the return of the Saar coal region and the complete abolition of the Treaty of Versailles. Because Italy sympathizes with this, it insists even more. As for France, it not only refuses to easily abandon its claim to security guarantees, but also regards the Treaty of Versailles as a matter of course and strives to make a military alliance between Britain and France a condition for Germany's demand for equality in armaments and the return of the Saar coal region. How can Britain lightly agree to such conditions? How can Germany tolerate it? How can Italy tacitly approve it? Moreover, Britain's intention is never to have a hegemonic country in continental Europe. How can it help France dominate Europe? Therefore, it is almost impossible to fundamentally eliminate the contradictions between European countries with overlapping borders and complex political situations. However, those who are good at mediation can make each other reluctantly concede and maintain temporary peace, or at least try to do so.</p>

<p>(Paris) When French Foreign Minister Pongou and Czech Foreign Minister Dr. Piniš spoke today, they reached a complete agreement on the three major issues of League of Nations reform, disarmament, and the aftermath of Central European economies. After the two foreign ministers spoke, they released a statement to the press. Pongou stated that Dr. Piniš's official visit to Paris was not intended to oppose any policy or any country, but to further international cooperation. What both sides resolved was to support the League of Nations without shaking it in the slightest, believing that improving the League's methods of doing things is more beneficial than reforming its organization. As for disarmament talks, no matter what progress is made in various aspects, the final result will be produced in Geneva. France and Czechoslovakia believe that economic cooperation in Central Europe can be achieved. Dr. Piniš said in this regard that Czechoslovakia's negotiations with Austria on this matter are currently underway and are expected to be successful. (16th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Paris) Today, President Lebrun hosted Czech Foreign Minister Belles for lunch. After the meal, Belles spoke with Prime Minister Xu Dang, and then went to the French Academy's welcome ceremony. After the event, Belles returned to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In front of Belles, Foreign Minister Pongou received journalists and issued a declaration, stating that since the Czech Foreign Minister was also present at this press conference, it showed that the two countries' opinions were completely consistent. Both sides had lengthy talks and conducted thorough research on international issues. Pongou also said that the thoughts he expressed when he spoke with Belles were the same as those of Prime Minister Xu Dang. Pongou also stated that the Czech Foreign Minister's visit to France had no other intention than to cooperate with France. The first issue studied by both sides was the League of Nations meeting and the issue of League of Nations reform that may be proposed. Both sides believed that the best way to devote ourselves to the League of Nations was to express our unwavering trust in the League of Nations. If our international peace organization is still very weak, if we listen to the League of Nations reducing its strength or allow it to be eliminated, then this weak peace organization will also collapse. Pongou also said that although the League of Nations cannot be considered permanently immutable, we can improve it, but if its fundamental principles are shaken, the League of Nations' reason for existence will be lost. Therefore, it is more beneficial to reform its working methods than to propose reorganizing the League of Nations. Regarding the issue of disarmament, Pongou and Belles agreed to declare that the final solution to this matter should be sought in Geneva. Pongou also said that the Czech Foreign Minister had told him that Czechoslovakia and Austria had hopes of success in their negotiations on economic issues between the two countries, and that the economic cooperation among the countries of the Little Entente was very close. At this point, Belles told reporters that he agreed with Pongou's statement and recalled the past cooperation between France and Czechoslovakia, saying that the two countries had friendly relations and that he and Pongou were old friends, so it was very convenient for them to discuss matters. Pongou's statement was a sign that the two foreign ministers' negotiations had come to an end, and it was also the last expression during Belles' official visit to France. Belles is scheduled to leave for the Czech capital next Monday. (16th Havas Dispatch)</p>

<p>(London) German Prime Minister Hitler's proposals to French Ambassador Ponset regarding disarmament matters have created a new situation. British Ambassador to Germany Fife will bring these proposals to London at the end of this week to discuss them with Foreign Secretary Simon. According to diplomatic reporters, the main points are as follows: (1) Germany may increase its national defense force from 100,000 to 300,000, and its long-term military service will be changed to short-term military service, but Germany is willing to sign non-aggression pacts with various countries. (2) Germany may take various reasonable steps to eliminate nationalistic militarism, but other countries must also take such actions. (3) Germany, like other countries, also agrees to a system of inspecting armaments, but this system is not convenient to implement when reorganizing the national defense force. (4) Germany is in favor of gradually abolishing heavy artillery, but demands equality in defensive armaments. Fife will return to Berlin soon to report on the impact of Hitler's proposals in London. According to Berlin sources, Berliners criticize France for being stubborn, severe, and slow in its progress. They believe that direct negotiations are the best way to reach a lasting solution. They welcome holding a four-power conference after the main principles have been agreed upon through separate negotiations. (16th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<p>(London) British Liberal Party leader Lloyd George published a statement in the Sunday Times, saying that he is a firm believer in the League of Nations. If the League of Nations collapses, world civilization will suffer a fatal blow. There is an international perception that the League of Nations is merely a tool in the hands of the victorious countries, rather than an institution that upholds justice. For example, Germany's withdrawal from the League of Nations was based on the excuse that the countries that monopolized the League of Nations were unwilling to treat Germany fairly and justly on the issue of armaments, so it angrily withdrew from the organization. This perception has deeply penetrated the minds of some people and is most detrimental to the League of Nations. We can only save the situation with patience and determination, and the guarantee of the League of Nations is especially important. (17th Havas Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e54">Overview of Soviet Russian Armaments: Current Total Military Strength Reaches 1.3 Million; Adopting a "National Defense First" Doctrine; Carrying Out Thorough Militarization <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>World Press Moscow News: The Soviet government sings high-sounding slogans such as complete or partial disarmament to the outside world, propagates anti-war ideology, and appears to be the embodiment of peace. However, internally, it is calmly and thoroughly carrying out its most thorough militarization, adopting a "national defense first" doctrine and giving priority to undertakings related to national defense compared to other undertakings. Especially in the Five-Year Plan, it exerts its focus on centralization, sacrificing all other undertakings without hesitation and prioritizing compulsory armament, causing the living conditions of the people to fall to the extreme of misery. The essence of the Five-Year Plan lies in the inevitable success of military-related industries. The iron, fuel, machinery manufacturing, chemical, especially automobile, and aviation industries have increased dramatically compared to other sectors. This fact aims at increasing military capabilities, which goes without saying.</p>
<p>Looking at its armaments, their content and substance have been greatly enriched and improved. Especially in 1932, it increased by four infantry divisions and one cavalry division, bringing the number of infantry divisions to 76, cavalry divisions to 13, and independent cavalry brigades to 8, with a total military strength of more than 1.3 million, surpassing the imperial Russian army before the European War. Other aspects such as firepower equipment, mechanization, and chemical warfare preparations are also showing rapid progress. Here is a numerical illustration of the gradual expansion of the Red Army's armaments in recent years:</p>

<p>(Tokyo) Saito Hiroshi's promotion to ambassador to the United States was endorsed by the army, naturally, and absolutely supported, praising the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' great decision. However, there are great expectations for Ambassador Saito, saying that promoting national prestige and defending national rights is the fundamental principle of diplomacy, which should be consistently implemented from beginning to end. However, besides establishing a true friendly relationship between Japan and the United States, the peace of the Pacific and the peace of the whole world cannot be expected. Therefore, the efforts of the new ambassador are hoped for, and the method of achieving it should be to take the United States as the pillar of North and South America and Japan as the only pillar of the Orient as a prerequisite. Therefore, it is necessary to first sweep away misunderstandings between the people of Japan and the United States. Otherwise, no matter how hard they work on the Second Washington Conference and the "Manchukuo" issue, they will not be able to reach a complete conclusion. It is hoped that Saito Hiroshi will be able to accomplish this great task to live up to the expectations of the people. (17th Dentsu Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The appointment of Saito, the minister to the Netherlands, to succeed Ambassador Debuchi as ambassador to the United States is seen as a determination by Foreign Minister Hirota to sweep away the attitude of withdrawing into conservatism, which has always afflicted traditional bureaucrats of the Shidehara school, and to shift US diplomacy with an aggressive spirit. It has gained domestic praise and is regarded as meaningful. It is said that with the thorough guidance of Foreign Minister Hirota and the agile activity of the new Ambassador Saito working together, Japanese-American relations will have a new development.

All Marine Corps stationed in Haiti are currently being withdrawn in succession and will be withdrawn completely within six months, leaving no one behind. According to this, the Marine Corps was sent to be stationed in accordance with the 1916 treaty to assist the country in establishing a responsible and orderly government. Later, there were several serious conflicts, the most serious of which was in 1929. Five Haitians were killed by the US Marine Corps. Therefore, US President Hoover appointed a delegation to investigate and study whether US troops should be withdrawn. The delegation then suggested a gradual withdrawal, to be completed by 1936. When President Roosevelt succeeded him, he decided to withdraw them as soon as possible. Therefore, the Navy Department and the State Department hope that they can be completely withdrawn by next June. (16th National Telegram)</p>

<p>Madrid: Lerroux, the leader of the Radical Party, formed a new Spanish cabinet last night. Lerroux was originally a journalist. Since the establishment of the Spanish Republic, he has participated in the first cabinet.

After the right-wing victory in the general election, the Spanish president believed that Lerroux was the only one who could unite the Socialist Party and the various right-wing parties to cooperate with each other. Therefore, yesterday afternoon, he urged him to form a new cabinet. Lerroux agreed and formed a cabinet in five hours. He presented the list of cabinet members to the president for approval that evening, which can be said to be extremely fast. Now, the old cabinet's Prime Minister Barrio has accepted the new cabinet's Minister of the Army, which is enough to guarantee the cooperation between the left and right factions. Others, such as Foreign Minister Romero, Navy Minister Lohan, and Finance Minister Lera, have all served in cabinet positions during the Republican government and are also outstanding figures of the time.

<p>(Moscow) Today, the Soviet Russian government, through its Consul-General in Harbin, issued a serious and important warning to the Manchurian puppet authorities regarding their continued implementation of anti-Russian policies in the administration of the Chinese Eastern Railway. The memorandum delivered pointed out that the puppet government was deliberately implementing a policy aimed at reducing the importance of the Chinese Eastern Railway and eliminating Soviet Russian rights over the railway's property, with the ultimate goal of completely seizing the railway. It stated that such circumstances violated the Fengtian and Beijing Agreements and made it difficult for Soviet Russia to recognize the legitimacy of the puppet officials' railway management plan. It also declared that the puppet government would bear strict responsibility for all damages suffered by the railway. In addition, it protested against the arrest of numerous Russian personnel of the Eastern Railway by the railway police dispatched by the puppet state, alleging that this action was an attempt to subvert the Soviet Russian railway organization in Manchuria. It is reported that this is the first direct warning issued by Soviet Russia to the puppet organization, and therefore this action has attracted great attention here. Previously, Japanese and puppet officials had repeatedly protested to Soviet Russia regarding what they claimed were illegal actions of the Chinese Eastern Railway, but it has not been disclosed whether Russia ever responded. (National Telegram, 17th)</p>
<p>(Harbin) The confrontation between Russia and the puppet regime over the Chinese Eastern Railway issue is gradually becoming more apparent. The Russian side has shifted from its usual passive strategy to an active one, forcing the head of the electrical department appointed by the "Manchu" state to resign, and Director Rudy dismissed the White Russian Sarya, who had been appointed as assistant station master at Baktu station by the "Manchu" state. This has further deteriorated the atmosphere between Russia and Manchuria. (Dentsu Telegram, 17th)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) The issue of reorganizing the Manchurian Railway has recently been formally reviewed by various central government agencies. Regarding the issue of supervisory authority over the Manchurian Railway, the Ministry of Colonial Affairs continues to oppose the entire proposal, and the Minister of Finance also expressed dissent from a fiscal standpoint. The final decision is likely to involve considerable turbulence. (Dentsu Telegram, 17th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) After meeting with Manchurian Railway President and Vice President Hayashi and Hatta on the evening of the 16th, Colonial Minister Nagai expressed his opposition to reforming the fundamental structure of the Manchurian Railway. The main points are recorded below: The government's original strategy was to have the Manchurian Railway manage various important industries necessary for the economic construction of Manchuria in a unified manner, as this was the most realistic approach. On the Manchurian Railway's side, it is even more imperative to adapt to the new situation and unleash its new capabilities, especially through improvement and expansion to strive for its realization. Not only that, but the company possesses vast capital of 800 million yuan, and it goes without saying that strict supervision is necessary to ensure that its investments do not stray from the right path. However, even if improvement and expansion are undertaken, any change to its fundamental structure that weakens its foundation, creates anxiety in society, or makes it difficult for funds to circulate, must be guarded against. Under the current circumstances, the urgent task is to swiftly and reliably process and vitalize the allocation of planned funds, allowing employees to work with peace of mind and devote their full efforts to the business, in order to complete the planned economic construction projects within the planned timeframe. This is the urgent task at hand, and nothing less will suffice. Therefore, when improving and expanding the Manchurian Railway, I feel that these key points must be fully considered.

<p>(Tokyo) The 65th session of the Diet is scheduled to convene on the 23rd. The government is currently working hard to prepare the bills to be submitted to the Diet. Because this session precedes the crisis of 1935 and 1936, important issues such as diplomacy, national defense, finance, economy, ideology, and rural areas are piled high. The government is also trying to overcome these difficulties. Therefore, an extraordinary budget of over 2.1 billion, an unprecedented amount, has been set. The Five Ministers Conference and the Cabinet Conference have been convened to deepen understanding of the extraordinary times. On one hand, countermeasures are being prepared for the Diet. On the other hand, an extremely cautious attitude is being adopted towards the bills submitted to the Diet. Therefore, the vice-ministers meeting held on the 14th for liaison and preparation did not see a determination, and it will be awaited until the next meeting. Currently, the proposals that have been confirmed are the Election Law Amendment Bill, the House Law Amendment Bill, the Health Insurance Law Amendment Bill, the Group Insurance Bill, the Export Association Law Amendment Bill, the State Management of Original Silkworm Seed Case, the Public Security Preservation Law Amendment Bill, the Publication Law Amendment Bill, the Newspaper Amendment Bill, the Factory Law Amendment Bill, the Trade Management Case, the Private Railway Subsidy Law Amendment Bill, etc. Those that have not yet been decided are the Rural Group Insurance Bill, the Tenancy Law, and the Special Financial Institution Establishment Law.

<p>(Moscow) The Moscow Lubyanka Prison, the headquarters of the famous Soviet Russian secret political police, was suddenly closed on the 3rd of this month. A part of it, which was under construction, was completely reduced to ashes. Officials today refused to announce the details of the negligence, but said that there were no deaths or injuries. The fire burned for as long as four hours, causing extreme panic in the city of Moscow. The broadcast of the official radio station in Warsaw seemed to be an exaggeration. On that day, the radio station said that the interior was destroyed as soon as the fire started, and then it spread to the armory, causing a large explosion. Several prisoners, prison guards, and firefighters were killed. Prisoners who had been convicted and executed were all imprisoned in the basement. Firefighters were unable to enter and provide relief because the fire was too fierce, and as a result, they all died tragically. The cause of the fire was a planned arson. Afterwards, the authorities arrested several people, but all Russian newspapers were forbidden to publish the news. When the fire started, all idlers were not allowed to approach the plaza, and pedestrians were not allowed to stand and watch. It is reported that the Lubyanka Prison is five stories high and very large. The four British engineers who were charged in Russia at the beginning of this year were imprisoned here.

<p>(London) Recently, newspapers have been full of new reports about the Loch Ness Monster. Some advocate catching it, while others advocate protecting it. Opinions vary and there is no consensus. A driver named Mr. Spaeirse claimed to have witnessed this strange creature on the seashore. Last night, he described on radio that the beast was 30 feet long, 4 feet high, and elephant-gray in color. When it crossed the road, it jumped repeatedly, and its back seemed to carry a small deer or lamb. Mr. Spaeirse drove after it, and the beast disappeared into the sea. But this statement was made by someone 50 years ago, and then it stopped and started. Roughly every five years, it must be rumored once, and it became even more prevalent last year. It is said that about a hundred people have seen this beast exposing its strange head on the surface of the sea, its eyes flashing like the lights of a car, its head like a camel, its body like an ox without horns, its head about seven feet long, its feet able to crawl, its skin rough and gray, and its tail like an eel. However, the descriptions of the crowd are also inconsistent. As for why it has appeared frequently this year, some say it is because the weather this summer is dry and windless, while others say it is because building roads on the seashore has disturbed the beast. Currently, the whole country is in a frenzy, using this beast as conversation material, as if they have forgotten the economic misfortunes and other national events. (Reuters Telegram, 17th)</p>

<p>Beiping Correspondence: Eastern Chahar, which had been somewhat relieved, was again invaded by more than 1,000 Japanese and puppet troops on the 14th, occupying the Xifengkou stronghold outside Dushikou, east of Chicheng. Today (16th), Chahar Chairman Song Zheyuan sent three telegrams to Beiping reporting and requesting instructions. The first telegram stated that, according to reports from Guyuan Commissioner Zhang Shusheng and Chicheng County Magistrate Wu Bingyi, more than 1,000 Japanese and puppet troops suddenly advanced towards Chicheng and Guyuan on the cold day (14th) and had occupied Xifengkou. The vanguard was advancing towards Longmensuo, carrying heavy firearms, tanks, and armored vehicles totaling more than twenty. Huang Shouzhong's troops temporarily withdrew to Longmensuo due to uncertainty about the Japanese army's intentions. The forward troops concentrated at Dushikou. The second telegram stated that, according to a telegram from Chahar East Garrison Commander Liu Guitang, more than 700 Japanese troops and 400 puppet troops, carrying four field guns and more than forty machine guns, were dispatched to Longmensuo. The main force was concentrated in the Dagge area. Huang Shouzhong and Zhang Junjie's troops outside Dushikou concentrated on Dushikou and Chicheng. The situation in Chicheng is tense, and how to respond should be indicated quickly. The third telegram stated that, according to reports, a week ago, four Japanese officers led more than twenty soldiers to survey the terrain between Datang and Dagge and ordered local residents to vacate houses and prepare firewood, claiming that a large army would be stationed there within a few days. At the same time, Song telegraphed Qin Dechun to ask the Beiping military and political authorities for instructions on how to deal with the tension in Eastern Chahar and to return to Chahar immediately to assist in military affairs. This morning, Qin Dechun went to Jurentang to meet with He Yingqin, reported on the situation in Eastern Chahar, and requested instructions. He instructed Qin to telegraph Song to order the front to be on strict alert and to handle the situation as appropriate. At the same time, he consulted with the Political Consolidation Committee and the Japanese responsible personnel in Beiping to raise concerns and find ways to stop the situation and avoid sparking a conflict. This afternoon, the Political Consolidation Committee sent personnel to the Japanese Embassy to visit military attaché Shibayama and formally raise concerns. Shibayama replied that he had received a telegram from the Kwantung Army stating that the 8th Division stationed in Rehe was dispatched to suppress bandits on the Rehe border and would definitely not invade Chahar. As soon as the bandits were cleared, they would withdraw. We pointed out that the Japanese and puppet troops had already invaded Chahar and requested that he immediately telegraph the Kwantung Army to quickly withdraw the troops to avoid misunderstandings. Shibayama agreed to forward the telegram to the Kwantung Army. According to various observations, the purpose of the Japanese army's sudden invasion this time is to extend the defense of the Great Wall. Qin Dechun, due to the tension in Eastern Chahar, has decided to return to Chahar tomorrow afternoon (17th) to assist in military affairs. (December 16th)</p>

<h3 id="e85">Japanese Side Lacks Sincerity in Returning Yuguan; Uses Bandits and Traitors to Secretly Refuse Reception; Tao Shangming Goes to Yuguan Again to Negotiate with the Japanese; Taking Over Various Passes of the Great Wall is Even More Out of the Question; Jin Mines in Northern Hebei Are Being Exploited by the Puppet State <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: Taking over the various passes of the Great Wall has been rumored for a long time, but it has not yet been implemented. This is probably due to the vast disparity in strength, making it difficult to rely on others' whims. Li Zeyi went to Changchun once to negotiate with the commander of the Japanese Kwantung Army, Hishikari, but there was not much progress. According to the Tanggu Agreement, we are taking over the various passes of the Great Wall, and the Japanese side originally had no reason to refuse. However, from the surface, the Japanese side has not refused, but in practice, it uses traitors, bandits, and puppet organizations to make us afraid of hurting the mouse and unable to take over. We cannot recognize puppet organizations as objects, so we have to negotiate with the Japanese side. The Japanese side's expression is extremely generous: whenever China takes over, the Japanese army will return the territory. As for the puppet organization, they dismiss it as another incident and are inconvenient to ask about. Tao Shangming once said that there is no problem in principle with taking over Shanhaiguan, only the takeover procedures have not yet been resolved. This is the truth, but little is known about the obstacles to the takeover procedures, which are not easy to eliminate. Therefore, Tao advocated accommodating several important figures from the Linyu Local Maintenance Association in order to facilitate the takeover and avoid hindering it. On the provincial government's side, because of the issue of administrative sovereignty, they are unwilling to have traitors mixed in. Provincial Chairman Yu Xuezhong once said that if you want to take over, you must do it thoroughly and not be sloppy and leave future troubles. The Beiping Political Committee believes that a hasty takeover is better than no takeover, because delaying and indulging it will make the puppet organization deeply entrenched, making the takeover even more difficult. Although a forced takeover is made at this time, the small details can be slowly resolved. The Beiping Political Committee is the highest administrative body in North China, and its proposal is naturally more powerful than that of the provincial government. However, from the perspective of the general public, it is also believed that taking over the various passes of the Great Wall is not to be tolerated or delayed. Because the phenomenon in the counties of eastern Luoyang is like an enclave, the small number of security teams with short guns and rifles cannot cope with the large gangs of bandits with organization and background. Last time, Qi Wenping, Zhang Kuiyuan, and others ran rampant in eastern Luoyang. After several negotiations, teams were dispatched to encircle and suppress them, recovering Funing. But how long has it been before border alarms have been reported again? (On the Great Wall border near Yiyuan Pass and Taolin Pass, three to four thousand bandits, some say five to six thousand, have gathered again.) They are eager to move with bows and arrows. The supplies of grain and ammunition they need are all transported from outside the customs in heavy trucks. It is undoubtedly certain that they have a background. Zhang Xueliang has decided to return to China next month. The Japanese side (Kwantung Army) opposes Zhang's re-seizing of military power, and its intention is to make the overall situation in North China fall into long-term chaos, so as to gain profit. If Zhang still leads the old Northeast Army, then the thousands of bandits on the border wall will surely rise up, so that the thirty counties in the war zone will be plunged back into chaos. On the other hand, if Zhang does not re-seize military power, the Japanese side will never feed these thousands of bandits for a long time. When the time comes, we will still need to send personnel to negotiate and obtain understanding, and then send a security team to encircle and suppress them again, killing a group of ignorant and unconscious compatriots. Therefore, in other words, if the various passes of the Great Wall can be taken over early and equipped with appropriate security teams, the bandits will have no base for gathering and activities. Tao Shangming went to Beiping yesterday (14th) to visit the two chairmen, Huang and He, and requested instructions. He will go to Yuguan with Linyu County Magistrate Yuan Tai within days to negotiate the takeover procedures with Yiwo, the chief of the special affairs agency of the Japanese Kwantung Army. But what day the takeover will be implemented is still uncertain at the moment. However, Shanhaiguan is only one of the passes of the Great Wall line. Taking over is so difficult. Taking over the other seventy-odd passes, large and small, such as Taolin Pass, Yiyuan Pass, Lengkou Pass, Xifengkou Pass, and Gubeikou Pass, is not yet being talked about. If they are all as difficult as Yuguan, taking over one pass will require several months of negotiation. I don't know when it will be possible to take over completely. Some people say that the Japanese side has refused to return the various passes of the Great Wall based on the sentence in the Tanggu Agreement "the Japanese army returns to the Great Wall line." If this statement is true, then whether or not Yuguan is taken over is irrelevant. Even if its claim is not true, and we can completely take over the various passes of the Great Wall, the territory of Hebei Province is already incomplete. Dushan County will never be recovered, and two-thirds of Xinglong County, outside the Great Wall, cannot be recovered either. Xinglong County is the richest in gold mines. The locals are all poor farmers, watching the gold but unable to mine it. Over the years, at the end of the farming season, a group of people wearing clothes and carrying baskets went to Dashui (Xiaoshui) Daoliushui (mountain streams) places to pan for placer gold. However, the gains were limited, and each person earned no more than five or six jiao per day. It was not until last year that merchants raised funds to mine and applied to the Department of Industry for a mining license. The department sent technicians to survey the site and was surprised by the richness of the gold mine. The matter was heard by people from the Northeast, so Gao Jiyi, Zhang Xueming, and others organized a large-scale Jibei Gold Mine Company, including Ji County, Zunhua, Xinglong, and Miyun counties. They wanted to implement a trust policy. Merchants and people, because of the great profits involved, vowed to resist to the death, and they were at odds with each other. Until the war at Xifengkou and Lengkou occurred, the Jibei Company was suspended invisibly. Recently, the puppet state raised funds to prepare for mining. The Jibei Company, seeing this with envy, is also actively preparing to carry out small-scale mining in Xisi Daozi, but the gold ore here is far inferior to that in Daoliushui. (December 15th)</p>
<h3 id="e86">Northern Route Army Painfully Suppresses Bandit Gangs in Eastern Jiangxi; All of Lichuan and Zixi Recovered <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: The Pseudo-First Route Army in the area of Zixi, Nancheng, Nanfeng, and Yihuang in eastern Jiangxi, after being painfully suppressed by the Northern Route Army and bombed by the Aviation Office, collapsed and retreated to the southeast near the Fujian border at the beginning of the month. The Pseudo-First Army retreated to the junction of Yihuang, Nanfeng, and Guangchang, attempting to enter Jianning via Kangdu. The Pseudo-35th Army retreated from Zhongxian in Lichuan to Zhangcun, hoping to enter Taining. The Pseudo-7th Army retreated from Songshi, Zhao Guangze in Zixi. Our army, led by so-and-so, etc., recovered Yingqian Zhongxian from Nanfeng, and the rear also reached Huangyuanzhen. Lichuan has fallen into the hands of our army. So-and-so, etc., departed from Nancheng Shangxu, clearing the bandits on the border between Nancheng and Lichuan. At the same time, so-and-so's Column, etc., advanced eastward from Jinxi towards Zixi, having already passed Songshi. County Magistrate Wang Zhen, who had escaped from Zixi and came to the province earlier, returned with the army this time. He had arrived with Xing's division at a certain place 30 li from Zixi County and telegraphed yesterday that there were no traces of bandits in Zicheng, and he would enter the city immediately to handle the aftermath and summon county government staff back to the office to restore county administration. The complete recovery of Li and Zi is no longer a problem. However, our army detected that the bandits were anxious to enter Fujian, so it ambushed the main force in the southeastern area of Lichuan. When most of the Pseudo-357th Army passed through Nanguo Village on the 12th, our army's ambushes came out in unison and valiantly intercepted them. After several hours of fierce fighting, the bandits fought and retreated, retreating from Desheng into Taining. According to a recent telegram from the front, more than 500 bandits were killed, thousands were wounded, 500 guns were captured, and one puppet battalion commander was captured in this battle. Our army is still following up and pursuing them eastward.</p>
<p>Furthermore, according to rice merchants from Yihuang, most of the bandits did indeed enter Fujian one after another. What they intend to do is subject to varied speculation. However, except for dividing a part of its force to take on district defense and security, the Northern Route Army's advancing armies are still advancing jointly from Nanfeng, Nancheng, and Jinxi towards Lichuan and Zixi. It is estimated that in the near future, all bandits within the borders of eastern Jiangxi, west of the Fujian border, will be wiped out. (December 15th)</p>
<h3 id="e87">Liu Xiang Plans to Pacify Sichuan Province, Reorganize Local Militias, Vigorously Implement Rural Cleansing, and Recruit Refugees for Resettlement <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>Hankou Dispatch: The Fifth Route Army of the Sichuan Bandit Suppression Forces, led by Wang Lingji, recently crossed the Qu River and divided into two routes to recover Sui and Xuan. Fan’s division formed the left wing, attacking Suiding, while the divisions of Li, Zhang, and Xu formed the right wing, attacking Xuanhan. The air force assisted both sides with bombing. It is reported that they are not far from the two cities. The divisions of Li Qixiang of the Third Route Army, Yang Sen of the Fourth Route Army, and Liao Zhen of the Sixth Route Army are jointly suppressing bandits in Yingshan and preparing to attack Yilong. However, the divisions of Deng Xihou of the First Route Army and Tian Songyao of the Second Route Army are moving somewhat slowly, as the roads in the north are dangerous and advancing troops is indeed difficult. Liu Xiang believes that with the deployment of various armies in place, progress should be smooth. Once various places are recovered, rural cleansing and resettlement must be carried out. In addition to dividing the area into six administrative regions and establishing administrative inspectors, attention will also be paid to reorganizing local militias, with Xian Ying as the chief commander of the Sichuan Northern Militia, specifically responsible for this matter. The areas for the Sichuan Northern Militia have already been demarcated, with Zhaoguangjian as the first district, Canglangyi as the second district, Nanchongyingpeng as the third district, Qu Guangyue as the fourth district, and Tongnanba as the fifth district. Furthermore, a pacification plan was promulgated, ordering compliance, roughly as follows: (1) Local militias in counties close to bandit areas should advance with the army, protecting transportation and maintaining治安 (zhì ān, public order); militias farther from bandit areas should be selectively transferred for advancement. (2) The army and local militias should strive to cooperate, clear out remaining bandits, cut off their communication, and implement a "clear fields" strategy. (3) Vigorously implement the joint militia rural cleansing, awaken the public’s self-defense, and construct fortified towers and fortresses. (4) Appoint fair and just gentry to maintain local security, and strictly dismiss unscrupulous gentry and local tyrants. (5) Reorganize the baojia (paochia) system, investigate households, and assess township and town leaders. (6) Recruit refugees and appease the displaced. (7) Strictly seal off bandit areas. (8) Strictly prohibit selling weapons to aid bandits. (9) Prevent recruiting bandits into the army. Liu Xiang himself is currently in the rear,统筹 (tǒngchóu, making overall plans) for the army's pay and provisions, replenishing weapons and ammunition, and planning for resettlement funds in the recovered bandit areas. However, the people of Sichuan Province are poor and resources are exhausted, and it is indeed not easy to scrape together funds. (16th)</p>

The Military Council allocated 50,000 yuan per month, and Liu Zhi supplemented it with 10,000 yuan. Later, he was ordered to downsize and reorganize the division into an A-class division under the new organizational system. About 2,000 men were dismissed, with Liu Zhi providing them with severance pay. The downsizing is now complete, leaving only three full brigades. Liu Zhi is scheduled to inspect the division on the 16th at the Southern演武廳 (Yǎnwǔtīng, drill ground). Zhu Tiexiang, counselor of the Pacification Headquarters and the Henan Provincial Government, has been appointed as the chairman of the first inspection group, with staff officers Cheng Jiong, adjutant Wang Xuezhai, and Huang某 (Huang Mou) as members.

<h3 id="e89">Xiaqing River in Shandong Province; Wuliu Sluice Project Completed; Opening Ceremony Held on the 15th <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>Jinan Dispatch: Han Fuju, Chairman of the Shandong Provincial Government, believes that the Xiaqing River, originating in Jinan, passing through Yangjiao Canal, and reaching the sea in the east, traverses the northeastern part of the province. If steamships can pass through, it will not only facilitate transportation and increase tax revenue, but also divert water for irrigation, benefiting the people. The project is of great importance. However, due to years of disrepair, the river has become silted up. Therefore, he consulted with Zhang Honglie, Director of the Construction Department, and decided to allocate significant funds to reorganize the Xiaqing River. The Construction Department then organized the Xiaqing River Engineering Committee to specifically handle this matter. The committee was established in April of the 20th year. It simultaneously conducted surveys and designs and invited businesses to carry out construction. Up to now, the construction of the Wuliu Sluice and Bianjiazhuang Dam, as well as the reorganization of the sources of the Xiaqing River, such as Baotu Spring and Black Tiger Spring, have been completed one after another. Among them, the Wuliu Sluice project is the largest. Recently, Xu Xinwu, a member and deputy chief engineer of the Yellow River Conservancy Commission, visited and praised it as the only new-style sluice in China. The Construction Department, concerned that various circles may not be fully aware, cordially invited various organizations and groups to visit on the afternoon of the 15th, and held the opening ceremony at the same time. They also invited visitors to see the Bianjiazhuang Dam and the dredging vessel at Huangtai Bridge. The Construction Department specially prepared several long-distance buses to transport the guests. The reporter was invited to attend, and the various situations are recorded below.</p>
<h3 id="e90">Chairman’s Report <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>The venue for the ceremony was set up on the north bank of the Wuliu Sluice. A mat shed was erected, with a horizontal banner hanging above, reading "Wuliu Sluice Opening Ceremony." A registration desk was set up in front of the shed. The meeting began at 2 PM. Chairman Zhang Honglie performed the rituals and reported on the purpose of the meeting, stating that the Xiaqing River Engineering Committee was established in April of the 20th year, and immediately conducted surveys and designs and invited businesses to carry out construction. Now, more than two years have passed. The completed projects include the reorganization of a part of Shequan and the construction of the sluice gates of the Wuliu Sluice and Bianjiazhuang Dam. The purpose of holding the opening of these two places is not to boast, but to allow the public to truly understand the importance of developing water conservancy. If everyone can work together and unite with one heart, continuing to repair other projects along the river will be easy. When the entire project is completed, the 40 million compatriots of Shandong Province will benefit from it. This is what the members of this committee are looking forward to. After Zhang's report, he, along with all the guests, went to the sluice gate to perform the opening ceremony. Zhang Yue, Zhang Honglie, Zhou Xiuwen, and Cao Liqing rotated the opening and closing mechanisms on both banks. First, the water volume was gradually released, and the gate slowly opened in a figure-eight pattern. The ships moored outside the gate passed through one after another. After the ships passed, the gate was closed again. Compared with the old sluice gates, ship navigation is much more convenient and without danger.</p>
<h3 id="e91">Sluice Gate Opening Conditions <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>(1) The Wuliu Sluice is located about nine li north of Jinan City, east of the old Wuliu Sluice. It is a double-gate type, with a gate opening of 92 meters wide, a sluice chamber of 100 meters long, a bottom width of 12 meters, and bank slopes of 1.5 to 1. The sluice pier is made of granite blocks. One row of sheet piles is driven upstream and downstream of each of the two gates and sluice piers to increase the seepage path. The sheet piles are 7.5 centimeters thick and 5 meters long. An arched stone洞 (dòng, cave/hole) is built inside the pier, 1.2 meters wide, 1.35 meters high in the center, and 75 centimeters high on both sides, for filling and draining water in the sluice chamber. The洞 (dòng, cave/hole) is equipped with an iron sliding door for opening and closing. Wooden闸 (zhá, sluice gate) doors are installed on both the upper and lower sluice gates, each door being 6 meters wide. The upper gate is 3.85 meters high, and the lower gate is 7.15 meters high. Each gate is equipped with an iron butterfly-style water gate, two holes that open and close simultaneously with the墩内 (dūn nèi, inside the pier) 洞 (dòng, cave/hole) to increase the drainage volume and save navigation time. The涵問 (hán wèn, culvert) sliding doors and butterfly-style water gates are all equipped with iron mechanisms for opening and closing. (2) After the Wuliu Sluice opening ceremony was completed, the attendees went to visit the Bianjiazhuang Sluice Gate. The construction of this gate had been completed long ago. The terrain is upstream of the Wuliu Sluice, and its structure is similar to the Wuliu Sluice, but smaller. There is also a spillway and a movable dam south of the gate. When the amount of water is regulated by the mountain洞 (dòng, cave/hole), there are more than a dozen 对槽 (duì cáo, facing each other) boats in the sluice, waiting for the sluice to open and pass. After the sluice is opened, ships接 (jiē, connect) each other順流 (shùnliú, downstream) without much effort. Outside the lower sluice gate, there is the "Jinan" dredging vessel, self-made by the Shandong Construction Department’s Hydraulic Machinery Manufacturing Plant, dredging mud. Observers on both banks are congested, and the scene is very lively.</p>

<h3 id="e93">Seven Officers and Soldiers of the Pixian Police Force Sentenced to Death; Joined the Communist Party and Conspired to Riot <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>Xuzhou Dispatch: The Pixian Police Brigade, instigated by reactionary elements, joined the Communist Party and conspired to riot. After receiving a report, the Central Government secretly ordered She Nianci, the Administrative Commissioner of the 12th District of Jiangsu Province, to handle the matter. On October 6th of this year, She, under the pretext of convening a joint inspection of the Tongshan, Pixian, and Suining county police forces, gathered the Pixian police force at Xiaotashan, east of Xuzhou. That night, he secretly ordered the Tongshan and Suining county police forces and the 12th District Security Regiment to surround and disarm the Pixian police force, confiscating more than 200 guns. Thirty-nine key officers and soldiers were arrested on the spot and taken to Xuzhou for interrogation. After repeated investigations, it was found that seven individuals, including Zhou Zhankui, Li Qichang, Wang Shengtang, Niu Qingchen, Wang Deyin, Gong Ziyi, and Zhang Zhendong, were deeply involved. The transcripts were compiled and reported to the Central Government for judgment and then submitted to the Provincial Government for approval. They were executed by firing squad this morning (16th). The remaining officers and soldiers were punished or released separately. Thus, the plot of the Pixian police force to riot, which had been brewing but not yet erupted, came to an end. The proclamation is recorded below: "Case investigation revealed that officers and soldiers of the Pixian Police Brigade joined the Communist Party. The undersigned (the Administrative Commissioner) previously arrested 39 officers and soldiers, including Zhou Zhankui, by name.

<h3 id="e94">Overall Salt Affairs Situation in China; Annual Salt Production Reaches 37 Million Dan; Monthly Tax Revenue Increases by 3 Million Yuan <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>Beijing Dispatch: Since the Northeast customs duties were seized by the Japanese puppets, the annual loss of national tax revenue has reached 40 million yuan, and the burden of various debts guaranteed by customs duties has thus increased sharply. In terms of salt affairs, since the Japanese forcibly occupied the salt inspection agencies in the three northeastern provinces in March of the 21st year, all salt tax revenue in the three provinces, including foreign debt installments, has been intercepted, resulting in a loss of 33 million yuan. Since the former Finance Minister Song Ziwen carefully reorganized the salt affairs, merging the salt transport offices with the inspection bureaus, eliminating corruption, and increasing the salt tax revenue. In the past, the monthly revenue was 2 million, but now it has increased to 5 million. This newspaper has inquired about the overall situation of the national salt affairs after the reorganization from the Ministry of Finance and the Salt Affairs Administration, and the details are recorded as follows.</p>
<h3 id="e95">Loss of Salt Tax Seized in the Northeast <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>In the 21st year of the Republic, the total national revenue from salt tax reached 155,212,000 yuan. Since the "September 18th Incident" occurred, 363,700 square miles of land and a population of 30 million have been lost, resulting in a reduction of 3.6 million dan of salt sales nationwide, and a direct loss of 33 million yuan in tax revenue. The stagnation of national finance and the impact on the operation of the salt industry are even greater. Therefore, the indirect losses are countless.</p>
<h3 id="e96">New Plan for Reorganizing Salt Affairs <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>In addition to the plans previously drafted by Song Ziwen that have been implemented one after another, Kong Xiangxi has recently redrafted a new, comprehensive plan to reorganize national salt affairs. The main points are as follows: (1) The national salt affairs are currently divided into 11 administrative regions, which are jointly managed by inspection agencies. The merger of these agencies can increase efficiency, save expenses, eliminate bad practices, reduce costs, and expand sales channels. (2) The整理 (zhěnglǐ, reorganize) of tax rates: The tax rates in various regions are inconsistent, which easily leads to dumping and facilitates smuggling. After the 整理 (zhěnglǐ, reorganize), the disparity in tax rates is no longer as high as before. In the future, they will gradually be unified, making it easier to collect taxes on the spot. (3) The gradual abolition of the anti-smuggling and administrative agencies at the sales outlets will increase tax revenue and reduce expenditures. This is the main point of the plan to 整理 (zhěnglǐ, reorganize) salt affairs.</p>
<h3 id="e97">Salt Tax Increases by 3 Million Per Month <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>In the past, the surplus salt tax was remitted to the Ministry of Finance by the Salt Affairs Inspection Bureau. Usually, it was only more than one million per month, and at most two million. Since Song Ziwen reorganized the salt affairs and merged the salt transport offices with the Salt Affairs Inspection Bureau, the salt administration procedures have become more convenient, and the salt tax revenue has greatly increased. Currently, 5 million yuan is remitted to the Ministry of Finance every month, and a preparatory fee has been collected since mid-September, at the rate of one 角 (jiǎo, 1/10 of a yuan) per salt transport ticket, specifically for the construction of salt warehouses and to subsidize poor sailors in the 12 Weirs. About 100,000 yuan can be collected per month. After the new plan is implemented in the future, revenue will definitely increase further.</p>

<p>In a temple in Xiaokunshan, the ninth district of this county, there lived a vegetarian who worshiped Buddha. Unexpectedly, a pirate ship suddenly arrived the other night, and seven or eight bandits jumped out, broke down the door, and entered. They frightened the people in the temple into silence, locked them in a room, and robbed them before fleeing with loud cries. That same night, a certain surname in a tomb house in Hengshan was also robbed by the same bandits. The losses were not significant.</p>

<p>Jingguang Bridge, located outside Xumen in Hengtang, was built during Emperor Gaozong’s southern inspection during the Qing Dynasty and destroyed during the Hong Yang Rebellion. This spring, Hui Hong, the head of the Mudu Autonomous Region, planned to build the Su Mu Road, considering the bridge a vital passage between the city and the countryside. He planned to rebuild it, and Zhang Jinyuan, a Suzhou native living in Shanghai, volunteered to fund the construction of the bridge. Shi Junqing, Chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, Liu Daxuan, the Chief of the First District of the City, and others jointly managed the matter. The bridge was entirely built of steel and concrete and renamed Jinyuan Bridge. It has now been completed. Yesterday (17th), the completion ceremony was held. More than a thousand people, including representatives from various organizations and groups, participated. Several steamships were specially chartered to transport them. During the ribbon-cutting ceremony, following the example of the completion of the Haizhu Bridge in Guangzhou, ten elders were invited to cut the ribbon: Wang Yunzhai, Shi Songting, Deng Jinshan, Qian Rongshan, Cao Runqing, Yan Chunsheng, Xie Baisheng, Zhu Wuting, Wang Nianci, and Zhang Yilin. Among them, Wang Yunzhai was the oldest at ninety-two years old, and Zhang Yilin was the youngest at sixty-seven years old. Therefore, Zhang specifically changed his name to "Zhang Xiaodi" when signing. Wang Yunzhai and Shi Songting gave speeches, stating that they had passed through the former Jingguang Bridge countless times when traveling between the city and the countryside before it was destroyed.</p>

<p>In recent years, the silk market has plummeted, and the silk factories are in extreme recession, leading to repeated disputes. Taixin Silk Factory in Changfeng Bridge, Huangnitou, stopped work on the 24th of last month due to excessive losses. However, it owed its employees about 7,000 yuan in wages, which it could not pay. Therefore, the manager of the factory, Xu Junjie, set fire to the cocoon warehouse on the night of the shutdown, intending to use the insurance compensation to repay the employees' wages. However, the compensation has not yet arrived, so the employees' wages have been repeatedly delayed. On the morning of the day before yesterday, more than 400 employees gathered at the factory to collect their wages. Xu Junjie was unable to cope with the situation, and the employees suddenly started a commotion, taking Xu to the Silk Factory Labor Union in Nancangmen. Mediation failed, so they took Xu to the First Branch of the Public Security Bureau for temporary detention. The employees then caused a disturbance at the labor union all night. Yesterday morning, they elected thirteen representatives, including Hua Yongbo, Su Amei, and Yin Hedi, and under the leadership of Qian Qixia, a member of the Labor Union Committee, they went to the County Party Headquarters and the County Government to petition. County Magistrate Yan advocated that Xu Junjie be transferred to the court for handling, so Xu was still detained in the Public Security Bureau yesterday. In addition, Qingfeng Silk Factory outside the South Gate also closed down last month, owing its employees more than 5,000 yuan in wages. After repeated demands without success, more than 300 people gathered at the factory around 4 PM yesterday, sitting down and demanding payment. The factory manager, assistant manager, chief accountant, and work director had all fled, leading to a conflict between the employees and Shen Guoheng, who was in charge of miscellaneous affairs at the factory. The large dining table and other items in the room were damaged. The chief of police Gong Baoda of the Third Branch of the Public Security Bureau led the police to the scene to suppress the situation and took the employee representatives and Shen Guoheng and others to the bureau for investigation by the headquarters.</p>

<p>Zhao Shu, an inspector from the Civil Affairs Hall, came to Changshu on the 14th. At first, he was quite secretive, but the county government discovered him the next day and accompanied him to inspect various agencies. On the 16th, County Magistrate Zhou Heng and Public Security Bureau Chief Yin Peng accompanied him to inspect the district administration and coastal defense in Meili and Hupu. Zhao convened a meeting with the township and town leaders, considering their knowledge too immature and the coastal defense still solid. He returned to the city that night. On the morning of the 17th, he hosted representatives from various circles to solicit opinions. In the afternoon, he inspected Micheng Town in the 14th District. During this inspection, Inspector Zhao paid close attention to the rural economy. Furthermore, County Magistrate Zhou Heng, who had been repeatedly accused of smoking opium, was also subject to strict investigation to determine the truth. Zhao stayed in Changshu for about two days before returning to the province to report.</p>

(3) The section chiefs and engineers will be responsible for preparing for the commencement of work in each section immediately, no later than January 1st. (4) Since the construction period for each section coincides with the winter defense period, the office should request Chairman Chen of the Provincial Government to add troops and increase military strength to ensure security and maintain order. (5) The number of squad leaders and team leaders should be determined based on the actual situation. (6) Prominent, respected, and impartial gentry should be invited to serve as advisory committee members in each section, in a honorary capacity. (7) Each section chief should visit the construction site at least once or twice a week to facilitate the progress of the project. In addition, the engineering office is actively conducting surveying work for each section and has organized three surveying teams. The first team is surveying from Liu Lao Jian to Qianjia and from Yaoxu Factory to Yanhetou. The second team is surveying from Qianjiaji to Xinjizhou. The third team is surveying from Xinjizhou to Longgou. They departed for surveying the day before yesterday (15th). Construction will commence after the surveying is completed.</p>
<h3 id="e106">Jiangyin, Provincial Government Orders Investigation into the Shooting of a Small Customs Patrol Boat <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>At 4:30 PM on the 3rd of this month, customs officers from the Jiangyin sub-customs office were patrolling the Jiang surface in Huangshan Port on a small customs patrol boat when they saw a civilian ship heading upstream. The ship was quite small and did not appear to be carrying any cargo, so they did not order it to stop for inspection. Unexpectedly, gunshots were suddenly heard from the ship. About ten people in military uniforms were seen on board. When the customs boat was about 50 yards away from the ship, the ship opened fire on the customs boat in several volleys. Several bullets hit the steel plate of the bow of the boat. The customs officers ordered the sailors on board to curl up and take cover and to steer to a safe place. At that time, the civilian ship continued to fire frequently at the customs boat, resulting in one bullet hitting the deck board of the stern cabin and one bullet hitting the face of the cook near the water tank. The civilian ship then sailed towards the Shixu Port area. A small boat loaded with cargo was seen following behind it. However, at the time of the incident, a ship of the Weijiang Company was also passing through the area heading upstream, so it was suspected that the civilian ship was protecting the loading and unloading of smuggled goods. The customs patrol boat then sailed to Huangtiangang, where the customs officers reported the shooting incident to the nearby water police team and requested their pursuit and protection. However, the people in the team claimed that the captain was not present, the number of water police was small, and the equipment was insufficient, making it difficult to respond. Later, Zhu Wenchao, the director of the sub-customs office, reported the incident to the Superintendent of the Zhenjiang Customs and sent a letter to the provincial government. The day before yesterday, the provincial government ordered the county government and the water police team leader to instruct the responsible personnel to conduct a thorough investigation and report the shooting civilian ship. Yesterday (14th), County Magistrate Ruan ordered the Public Security Bureau to investigate.</p>

<p>The Jiaxing County Government held a county government meeting on the previous two days, and the following important cases were resolved: (1) The current County Administrative Meeting was held on the 15th, designating Chen Youkai and Hu Daying as recorders, and each bureau and section allocated one clerk. (2) The Jiaxing Chamber of Commerce previously requested the Hebao case team to install electric lights, resulting in a loss of 267.12 yuan of silver. It was requested to be reimbursed from the county tax reserve fund. Resolution: The county tax reserve fund has been used for advances and no savings remain. This loss of lighting installation fees for the Hebao troops should be submitted to the Security Office for reimbursement. (3) The ten surplus patrol boats received by the county government under orders were handed over to the County Public Security Bureau to hire craftsmen to repair and convert into six boats, which were issued to the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, and 7th Public Security Bureaus for use as water patrols. The repair costs were paid from the accumulated police funds.</p>

<p>Landlords in Jiaxing report that the collection of grain taxes is very strict, but the authorities do not care about the landlords' collection of rent, which is unfair. The landlords have now drafted a trial method for collecting rent from tenant farmers, and public avoidance Sheng Yuan and others have submitted it to the party and government authorities for adoption, approval, and implementation. The County Executive Committee, after receiving the report, has appointed Yang Wei, Wang Chunong, and two other committee members to conduct a detailed review and then handle the matter.</p>

<p>In the inner room of Wang Gongchang's dyeing workshop on East Main Street in this city, there has been a very large gambling den for many years. A few nights ago, someone reported it to the County Public Security Bureau, which ordered the police to arrest them. Forty-four people were captured on the spot, and over seventy or eighty people scattered and fled in the chaos. After being sent to the county, the trial commissioner, Tu Zhitong, sentenced them to fines ranging from 70 to 500 yuan, totaling over 5,000 yuan. The money on the table was confiscated. After the incident, the local residents, including Ji Shangying, learned that the mastermind behind this was Zuo Chunzheng, the former secretary of the county government, and jointly telegraphed the provincial authorities to investigate. Zuo left south on the Pingza Highway bus the day after the incident. County Magistrate Zhang Zhouwen learned of this and immediately telegraphed the Zha Pu Public Security Bureau to arrest him. Unexpectedly, this telegram had just arrived, and Zuo had already taken a bus to Shanghai. It is now heard that the county government has issued an arrest warrant to capture Zuo and other criminals to bring them to justice and investigate the matter thoroughly.</p>

<h3 id="e113">News from Our City: Four Party Departments Again Request That the Central Government Immediately Dispatch a Large Army to Publicly Punish Fujian <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>According to the Guomin News Agency, the Shanghai Special City Party Department, the Two-Road Special Party Department, the Seamen's Special Party Department, and the Security Team Special Party Department stated that the Fujian Incident has lasted for almost a month. Chen Mingshu, Li Jishen, and others created this rebellion and are criminals against the party and the nation, and must not be tolerated any longer. Yesterday, they jointly telegraphed the central government again, requesting that the National Government immediately dispatch a large army and publicly punish them. The original telegram is transcribed as follows: Urgent, respectfully to the Nanjing Central Executive Committee: Chen Mingshu, Li Jishen, and other rebels, under the pretext of public opinion, organized the so-called People's Government in Fujian, changed the era name and system, usurped the title and enjoyed themselves, destroyed the party and betrayed the country, colluded with bandits and sided with the enemy. Any one of these crimes is unforgivable. We have previously telegraphed requesting a public punishment. However, the incident has lasted for almost a month, and we have not seen any orders issued to punish them, and we have heard that some people advocate resolving it through political means. Our associations are deeply shocked. We believe that the rebellion created by the rebels Chen and Li is a crime against the party and the nation, and must not be tolerated any longer. Otherwise, ambitious people will follow suit, and our country will never have hope of stability. We feel a sense of danger and dare not remain silent. We are telegraphing again to earnestly request the National Government to immediately dispatch a large army and publicly punish them, and to ensure that the rebels Chen and Li are brought to justice and punished to uphold the national law and discipline. We are extremely anxious in this telegram. The Shanghai Special City Executive Committee, the Two-Road Special Party Department, the Seamen's Special Party Department, and the Security Office Special Party Department, together bow.</p>
<h3 id="e114">Yang De Zhao Discusses the Loan from Guangdong Province: The Provincial Bank's Cash Reserves for Banknotes, Amounting to Approximately 60 Million, Have Been Almost Completely Used; This Loan Is Entirely for Financial Regulation <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>According to the Xinxin News Agency, Yang Dezhao, the representative in Beijing of Chen Jitang, the Commander-in-Chief of the Southern Route Bandit Suppression Army, arrived in Shanghai on the overnight express train from Beijing the night before, awaiting a ship to go south to Guangdong to report to Chen. Yesterday morning, a reporter from the Xinxin News Agency visited him at his residence on Avenue Amyot, and he discussed in detail the motives and process of Guangdong Province's request for a loan. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e115">Motivation for the Loan <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>Yang replied to the reporter's question, first stating that since the 20th, 21st, and 22nd years, the financial situation in Guangdong Province has become increasingly strained. The Provincial Bank's cash reserves for banknotes have been almost completely used, totaling 30 million yuan. The other various public bonds and other items have also been collected and used up, amounting to no less than 30 million yuan. The two together total about 60 million yuan, which is the financial deficit of the province, and must be urgently rescued. Moreover, this deficit originally belonged to the central government, and the central government should assist Guangdong Province in seeking ways to rescue it. Therefore, the motivation for Guangdong's request for this loan is to seek financial rescue.</p>
<h3 id="e116">Request Process <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>Yang continued, "The Guangdong Provincial Bank was formerly the Central Bank. After the Central Bank established its head office in Shanghai, the Central Bank in Guangdong was reorganized last year and named 'Guangdong Provincial Bank,' which is the current Provincial Bank. The accounts, etc., still follow the old rules of the former Central Bank. The banknotes issued by the former Central Bank, except for the ten-yuan notes which have not yet been exchanged, have all been exchanged for new Provincial Bank notes. However, the cash reserves in the bank are very empty, as I mentioned earlier. Because the reserves are empty, whenever problems occur, it often leads to runs, which are difficult to deal with. For example, after the outbreak of the Fujian Incident, Guangdong experienced a run due to frequent rumors. Fortunately, the authorities responded effectively and were able to overcome it safely. The process of requesting this 15 million yuan loan was that the Guangdong authorities had already contacted and agreed with the central government in advance. I attended the Central Standing Committee meeting only to explain the reasons. The method is for Guangdong Province to directly raise funds from the Hong Kong and Guangdong banking community, and request the central government to designate a guarantee. The central government generally has no problem with this. As for what exactly will be designated as a guarantee, it has not yet been decided, but it will probably be the subsidy fee allocated by the central government to Guangdong Province as a guarantee, which is also unknown."</p>

<p>Continuing the conversation, he said, "I plan to leave Shanghai on the President Hoover liner tomorrow (the 19th) and return south to Guangdong. This trip has no mission, it is entirely for private affairs, in addition to celebrating my father's 70th birthday, and also dealing with the affairs of the Bohe Middle School that I founded. The school is located in my hometown of Dabu and focuses on labor education, etc."</p>

That evening, he took the Beijing-Shanghai overnight express train with Vice Minister Tang Youren and Secretary-General of the Legislative Yuan Liang Hancao and others to Shanghai. Huang arrived in Shanghai at 7:30 yesterday morning at the North Station. Because Huang was tired from the journey, he did not meet with reporters. He only met with the new Vice Minister of the Interior, Fu Rulin, at about 10:00 AM to discuss ministry affairs. The two met for about an hour, and Fu left at about 11:00 AM.</p>

<p>The French Concession Chinese Taxpayers Association, regarding the illegal arrest of naturalized Chinese citizen Jin Xi by the Japanese Consulate, sent a letter to the French Consulate General in Shanghai yesterday to negotiate, requesting that a serious protest be made to the Japanese Consulate as soon as possible to protect our national sovereignty. The original letter is recorded as follows: "Respectfully, regarding the case of the Japanese Consulate General in Shanghai illegally arresting Jin Xi, who has been naturalized as a Chinese citizen, in the French Concession, we have verified that Jin Xi's father, Jin Yongduo, was naturalized in China on October 15th of the 18th year of the Republic of China, obtained Nationality Permit Certificate No. 67 from the Chinese Ministry of the Interior, and clearly stated the age of his eldest son Jin Xi. Now the Japanese Consulate General dares to illegally arrest Chinese citizens in the French Concession, which disregards the sovereignty of both China and France and is not tolerated by international law. In addition to requesting our government to immediately negotiate directly, we hereby request your Consul General to forward a serious protest to the Japanese Consul General in Shanghai. We pray that the progress of the negotiations will be announced in the newspapers as soon as possible to comfort the eager anticipation of our Chinese citizens. Sincerely, to the French Consul General in Shanghai, Meryl, respectfully from the French Concession Chinese Taxpayers Association."</p>
<p>In addition to sending the letter, the association's executive and supervisory committees recently resolved to nominate Vice Chairman Cheng Zhusun to prepare to negotiate with the French Consulate in person to achieve the goal of returning Jin Xi. Otherwise, the residents of the concession will lose their protection, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e121">The First Batch of American Wheat Will Be Imported This Afternoon: Berthing at Buoys No. 4 and No. 5, Unloading Will Begin Tomorrow Morning; Tax-Exempt Import of Goods Has Been Undertaken by Chinese Merchants <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the purchase of American cotton and wheat by our government, the transportation matters are undertaken by the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. The first batch of American wheat did not arrive yesterday, and is now scheduled to arrive in Shanghai at 2:00 PM this afternoon, berthing in the Huangpu River. Unloading will begin tomorrow. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e122">Strict Secrecy <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>The state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company chartered a vessel from the American-owned Flett &amp; Co. to transport American-loaned cotton and wheat to China. The first batch of American wheat, 8,940 tons, was loaded on the SS Aliebra Bank on the 20th of last month and set sail from North America to Shanghai via the Pacific Ocean and Japan. The shipowner previously telegraphed that it was scheduled to enter the Wusongkou at 4:00 PM yesterday and berth at buoys No. 16 to No. 17 on the Huangpu River off Yangshupu Lan Road. However, the Central Bank's US Cotton and Wheat Office, the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, and the American-owned Flett &amp; Co. all kept this matter strictly secret, so the vessel was not seen entering port at 5:00 PM.</p>
<h3 id="e123">Import This Afternoon <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>At 5:30 PM, an investigation was conducted at buoy No. 16 in the Huangpu River, and it was learned that the vessel had indeed not arrived in Shanghai. Then, inquiries were made to the shipping industry, and it was confirmed that the master of the SS Aliebra Bank telegraphed Shanghai at 1:00 PM yesterday, reporting that the vessel had encountered fog en route and would not be able to enter the Wusongkou until 2:00 PM today. The original plan was to berth at buoys No. 16 to No. 17, but because those buoys were already occupied by transport vessels, the Jianghai Customs notified Flett &amp; Co. to change the berthing to buoys No. 4 to No. 5.</p>
<h3 id="e124">Tax-Exempt as Before <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>After our Ministry of Finance promulgated the collection of import duties on foreign rice, wheat, and flour starting on the 16th of this month, the first batch of American wheat was originally scheduled to be imported on the 11th of this month. Because the vessel encountered fog en route, the import would inevitably be subject to import duties today. After the Central Bank's US-Loaned Cotton and Wheat Office contacted the Ministry of Finance, it was decided to exempt it from taxes. All customs clearance procedures have been completed. However, all future imports of American-loaned cotton and wheat must be subject to import duties in accordance with regulations.</p>
<h3 id="e125">Unloading Tomorrow Morning <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>The first batch of American wheat, 8,940 tons, has been purchased by Chinese flour mills. After the vessel arrives in Shanghai today, it has been decided to start unloading tomorrow morning. First, the various Chinese flour mills will directly extract it and store it in their warehouses. The remaining American wheat will still be stored in the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Chinese warehouse or the Yangtze Wharf. The vessel, after being unloaded, will be loaded with our country's export goods to the United States.</p>

<p>Representatives from Hope and the other two companies went to Beijing to participate. According to the Huadong News Agency, since the Ministry of Industry and Commerce and the German company Hope and the other two companies discussed the state-run steel plant issue, all the clauses of the entire plant agreement have been drafted. However, due to review reasons, the signing procedures have not yet been held. Yesterday, a reporter from the Huadong News Agency specifically visited He Bingxian, Director of the International Trade Bureau, and other relevant parties regarding this matter, and learned that the Ministry of Industry and Commerce has scheduled a meeting in Beijing today (the 18th) to convene various preparatory committees to continue discussions. Representatives from the German company Hope and the other two companies received an official letter from the Ministry of Industry and Commerce in advance and took the overnight train to Beijing the day before yesterday (the 15th) to participate in the discussion of everything today.</p>

<p>Only the Dutch Java Company operates commercial ships on the Shanghai route to Java in the South Seas Islands. Its business has traditionally focused on the import of Java sugar and the export of Chinese soybeans. This year, the import and export business is quite sluggish. In order to attract business, the company has opened an express ship, and its plan to reach Nanyang in eleven days is urgently recorded below to inform those concerned about shipping.</p>
<h3 id="e128">Sharp Decline in Freight <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>Most of the sugar sold in our country is Java sugar, which is also the raw material for Dongyang sugar and is purchased from Java. After the sugar tax increased this year, the import tax exceeded the sugar price by more than three times, causing Java sugar to come to China to plummet. Sugar merchants have stopped ordering one after another, and the number of shipments has decreased sharply, causing Java shipping to also suffer this year. Now, each ship carries at most only one or two thousand tons, and sometimes only five or six hundred tons, which is less than 20-30% of the previous amount. Since the Northeast was occupied, the export of soybeans from our country, which was previously transshipped in Shanghai, has now been completely changed to Dalian. The shipment of goods from Shanghai has fallen to an extremely low level.</p>
<h3 id="e129">Limited Passengers <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>Most of the Chinese living in the South Seas Islands are from Fujian and Guangdong, so the company's ships must pass through Xiamen to facilitate the travel of overseas Chinese from Fujian Province. Recently, the authorities in the South Seas colonies have increased the head tax for Chinese going to the South Seas because the sugar and rubber industries there have been sluggish this year, and they have been particularly strict in restricting the entry of laborers. Without a familiar merchant acting as a guarantor, they are prohibited from landing, so the passenger business has also been greatly affected. There are no restrictions on consumers traveling to Nanyang.</p>
<h3 id="e130">Opening an Express Route <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>In order to develop the shipping industry, Mr. Yan Liwen of the Java Company's Shanghai Deda branch personally went to Nanyang to conduct inspections. Considering that in recent years the shipping industry has been opening express ships, regardless of the European and American routes, the sea journey has been shortened and time has been saved. Ships to the South Seas Islands have traditionally taken 26 days to reach Batavia from Shanghai. Now, in the autumn of competition, the company has also decided to launch a special express ship on the route from Shanghai to Batavia starting next month, reducing the days of docking at various places and increasing the speed at the same time. From Shanghai to Batavia, it is limited to only eleven days of sailing. It is planned to dispatch three of the largest ships, such as the 12,000-ton Zhibada, to sail. This route is currently being planned, which will shorten the journey to Nanyang by more than half and reduce the suffering of being confined to a ship.</p>

<p>Fan Chongshi, the Shanghai representative of Liu Xiang, the Commander-in-Chief of Bandit Suppression in Sichuan, went to Sichuan in early October to visit Liu and make a report. He has now returned to Shanghai after completing his official duties. According to him, the communist bandits in northern Sichuan are gathered north of the Quhe River, along the Bashui River in Tongjiang, Nanjiang, Bazhong, Yilong, Wanyuan, Daxian, and Xuanhan, and their main bandit army is in Daxian and Xuanhan. There is a large mountain east of the bandit area, with no roads to travel. The other three sides, south, west, and north, are currently surrounded. The southwest is guarded by the Third Route Army of Li Jiayu and Luo Zezhou, and the Fourth Route Army of Yang -. The west is garrisoned by the Second Route Army of Tian Songyao, attacking the southern part of Yilong. The northwest is garrisoned by the First Route Army of Deng Xihou, blocking the communist bandits from fleeing to Shaanxi and Gansu. The south is garrisoned by the Fifth Route Army, the 21st Army, attacking the main force of the Red bandits. The 21st Army's Fan Shaozeng department has now crossed the Quhe River and is fighting hard. The Wang Lingji department is supporting on the right, and the progress is quite smooth.</p>

<p>According to the Daily News Agency, a reporter from the Daily News Agency specifically visited Li Dingzhang, the representative of Liu Heding, yesterday morning. According to him, Liu's troops are currently in the □□ area of northern Fujian, strengthening their defense work, waiting for the Fujian army to attack, and will give them a head-on blow. However, as of yesterday, there has been no contact on the front line. The reporter also asked if there had been contact on the front line, and the response was that detailed information had not yet been confirmed. In recent days, the military has indeed reached a tense period, and the Fujian side is actively mobilizing troops, with a strong momentum for attack. Minor contact in the middle may have occurred, but the Fujian side's ability is limited, and the war will definitely not expand.</p>
<h3 id="e133">The Fujian Side Contributes to the Red Disaster, Shanghai News <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>According to the Xinsheng News Agency, the Fujian side is taking advantage of the chaotic situation and repeatedly spreading rumors of invading Zhejiang to the north, which has become increasingly urgent in recent days. According to a reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency yesterday morning, the reason why Fujian dares to make this desperate gamble is that it has completed a solid military alliance with the communist bandits, forming a mutual support. It is using the north to contain the central government and the south to threaten Chen in Guangdong. It is learned that in Yanping and Gutian, two places 60 to 100 miles northwest of Fuzhou, communist troops are openly entering and exiting. The area between the central army and the so-called People's Revolutionary Army has been dominated by the communist army. The Fujian side is relying on this point as its rear, and only deploying the 19th Route Army to garrison various important places within 100 miles of the north and south coastlines. As for the Quanzhou, Zhangzhou, Haicheng, and Shima areas on the border between Fujian and Guangdong provinces, there are currently about 10,000 troops under Zhang Yan and Weng Zhaoyuan stationed there, while Nansheng, Zhangpu, Heping, Yunxiao, and Zhao'an are distributed by communist bandits. The recent deployment of the Guangdong army is for this reason. Therefore, it can be seen from the fact that the Fujian side has concluded a defensive alliance with the communist bandits. It is heard that more than 1,000 soldiers of the People's Government stationed in Shunchang and Changle recently mutinied, took up arms, and became bandits. They raised the red flag and established a Soviet government in the area, and there is deep concern that the 19th Route Army will be completely engulfed by communism.</p>

<p>According to the Xinxin News Agency, regarding the recent situation of the central army suppressing bandits in Jiangxi, a certain organization in this city received a letter from a certain division headquarters of the bandit suppression army yesterday, reporting in great detail and summarizing the various situations as follows:</p>
<p>Bandit Suppression Victory: On December 11, the central □□□ Division attacked (Ngo-Aung-Yu) between Le'an and Yongfeng, captured the headquarters of the fake Soviet Provisional Government in Jiangxi, and killed or wounded three members of the fake Soviet Military Commission, capturing the chairman of the fake Jiangxi Provincial Government and ten other members. A large number of propaganda materials and countless military supplies and munitions were also seized. They are currently in pursuit.</p>
<p>Comforting Wounded Soldiers: At the request of Madame Chiang Song Meiling, the Nanjing Women's Relief Association is comforting the wounded soldiers who are fighting hard on the front lines in Jiangxi by sending out 3,000 gift packages. Each package contains a cotton vest, a thermos, several boxes of biscuits and candies, and several towels. These gifts will be personally distributed by Madame Chiang during her second trip to the front line to inspect the wounded soldiers' hospitals in order to provide comfort.</p>
<h3 id="e135">Aviation Exhibition Postponed <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>The aviation exhibition initiated by the China Aviation Association plans to collect various air defense weapons and display them in Shanghai for three weeks starting on January 28 of next year, the anniversary of the Songhu Anti-Japanese War, so that people in Shanghai can have a better understanding of air defense weapons and arouse their interest in saving the country through aviation. After the association made the decision, it sent letters to the Air Force Department of the Ministry of Military Affairs, aviation schools, aviation factories, and the Ordnance Department to solicit exhibits. After receiving the letters, each place began preparing one after another. Aviation schools are investigating and compiling various statistical charts, aviation factories are selecting various aircraft models and spare parts, and the Ordnance Department is willing to send high-altitude artillery shells to the meeting for display. Therefore, preparations are well underway. However, due to the sudden outbreak of the Fujian Incident, the Air Force Department had no time to assist the association in preparing, so the aviation exhibition will be postponed. However, the association hopes that it can still open in the near future.</p>

<p>Due to the recent downturn in the Japanese fishing industry, Japanese fishing vessels have repeatedly conducted large-scale fishing off our coast to make up for it. According to a recent investigation by a reporter from the Heping News Agency, more than 30 Japanese vessels have sailed from Okayama, Kagawa, Kumamoto, and Saga prefectures to the coastal areas of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shandong in our country, privately fishing for sharks, scabbard fish, and other fish in large quantities, causing our country's fishing industry to suffer the impact of this dumping and suffer a setback. If remedies are not sought urgently, then after the bankruptcy of rural areas, the fishing industry will also go bankrupt.</p>

The public discussed proposals requesting the association's assistance, and the following resolutions were made: (1) Regarding the application from the Apartment Industry Association for negotiations to reduce donations, the association had previously sent a letter to the French Municipal Council for re-examination, but there has been no response. Now, the Central Datong and Xindu apartments have been forced to pay the second phase of additional donations, which has been collected by French personnel. The industry association has again sent a letter urging negotiations and stating its determination to protest the third phase of increased donations. It was resolved to send another letter to the French Municipal Council to inquire whether the re-examination is being conducted and request a response. (2) The owner of Chen Juchang Woodenware Store sent a letter stating that he was fined after the French Municipal Council Health Department initiated a sanitation donation, and now a summons has been issued, scheduling him to be sued in the Second Special District Court on the 18th, requesting the association's negotiations. It was resolved to investigate and find that there were only three people in the workshop who did not comply with the sanitation regulations, so there was no need to pay the donation. The association should send a letter to the court to certify this and hand it to the owner to bring to the court. (3) The French Concession Primary and Secondary Schools Joint Association requested the exemption of donation taxes for various Chinese schools. It was resolved to hand it over to the next session of the committee and the Chinese directors to handle. (4) Zhang Tongtai South Goods Store’s case regarding extra donation charges. It was resolved to send a letter to the French Municipal Council to protest. (5) After Jin Zhe, a naturalized Chinese citizen, was arrested by the Japanese consulate in the French Concession, in addition to the association sending a letter to the French Consulate General for negotiations, stating that all those arrested must undergo written interrogation by the Chinese court, and because there has been no response from the French Consulate General, it was resolved to send another letter to the French Consul General and nominate Chairman Cheng to go for negotiations. (6) Shen Chen's small shop in Qianjiatang was canceled due to another case. It was resolved to send a letter to the French General Inspector, ordering public officials to strictly restrain themselves and not infringe on citizens without cause.

<h3 id="e140">Seamen's Union Conducts Registration; Issues Notice to Seamen Yesterday <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>After the dissolution of the China Seamen's United General Association, the Central Government ordered Yang Hu and others to prepare for the establishment of the China Seamen's Union. After the association's preparations were completed, it is now actively preparing to establish branches in various regions. However, due to the inconsistency of all badges and certificates after the reorganization, the association convened a meeting of seamen's groups the day before yesterday to discuss registration methods in order to unify them. The association's notice to seamen, issued yesterday, is recorded as follows: "Dear seamen, you work day and night in the treacherous waves, sacrificing yourselves to seek happiness for the masses and survival for the nation. Such a great spirit is so glorious and admirable! However, capitalist imperialists use ruthless and insidious means to continuously ravage you, and the comprador class, acting as accomplices, oppress you one after another. What a painful and unjust thing! Our Prime Minister Sun Yat-sen, witnessing the general seamen suffering such heavy ravages and oppression, could not bear to see you forever trapped in deep water, leading an inhuman life, so he used his life's efforts to awaken you, teach you to unite and fight. In the past, with the leadership and command of our party, the Seamen's Union once blossomed brilliantly. However, during this period, due to the sabotage of the Communist Party, it fell into a state of disunity. Later, thanks to the Central Government's dispatch of personnel to reorganize, remove the muddy and retain the pure, it gradually embarked on the right path. Unexpectedly, the January 28th Incident occurred, and the Shanghai Seamen's Union Reorganization Committee had to stop working. By the time the war ended, a few seamen comrades organized the so-called Shanghai Seamen's Union Maintenance Committee. In May of this year, the Shanghai Seamen's Union Temporary Steering Committee was established, mutually undermining each other, viewing the union as a weapon, leaving our seamen at a loss. In September of this year, our association was produced under the leadership of the China Seamen's Union Preparatory Committee, taking over the former Shanghai Branch Reorganization Committee of the China Seamen's Industrial United General Association, the Shanghai Seamen's Branch Maintenance Committee, and the Shanghai Seamen's Union Temporary Steering Committee one by one. In other words, in the recent past, the chaotic situation of each governing its own affairs has been unified. Only our association is the only group for the seamen of Shanghai. However, our association has not been established for long, like a garden that has been barren for a long time. All the work must wait for the gardeners, the seamen, to work hard to cultivate and plant. In this way, our garden can gradually flourish, and a sound foundation can be built here. We also feel that the previous failure was due to the separation of the union and the workers. In fact, the union is an organized body of workers and should be maintained by all workers. As for the union, it should also stand in the position of the workers, fighting for the workers and sacrificing for the workers. This can make the union and the workers become one entity. Therefore, our current plan is: (1) to strengthen the organization and enrich the power of the national revolution; (2) to improve the treatment of workers and protect their lives; (3) to relieve the suffering of workers and improve their technical abilities; (4) to assist the government in developing routes and recovering navigation rights. Dear seamen, thinking about your interests and thinking about the completion of the national revolution, our association is determined to use great power to implement the above four plans. At the same time, we hope that you will also stand in the same position, keep pace with our association, and work together to promote the realization of this plan. We will use this to strengthen the connection between workers and the union, creating a real union that seeks benefits for the workers and demonstrates the power of the workers."</p>

<h3 id="e143">Buddhist Association: Memorial Service for Huang Maolin Yesterday; Promoting Buddhism Globally; Raised 6,000 Silver Dollars for Bereavement <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese Buddhist Association, Shanghai Buddhist Association, and other groups held a memorial service for Layman Huang Maolin at Jueyuan at 2 p.m. yesterday. Those present included Yuan Ying, Huang Hanzhi, Guan Jiongzhi, Wen Lanting, Li Jingwei, Zhu Xiechen, and dozens of others. Yuan Ying, chairman, reported the purpose of the meeting, stating that Layman Huang Maolin, editor of the English Buddhist magazine, was the only contributor in the country who could promote Buddhism globally. He had translated the Sixth Patriarch Altar Sutra, the Amitabha Sutra, the Ten Wholesome Karma Path Sutra, and the first volume of the Consciousness-Only Treatise, which in recent years has influenced European people's inclination towards Mahayana Buddhism, and has had a good understanding of Chinese Buddhism. Two years ago, he made a vow to travel west to India to study Sanskrit and Pali Buddhist scriptures. Colleagues had supported his journey, hoping that he would return to China after completing his studies and make great contributions. Unexpectedly, on the 1st of this month, a telegram was received from a friend in Kuala Lumpur, shocking everyone with the news that Mr. Huang had tragically drowned at sea on the 28th of last month. The loss of such a rare talent in Buddhism is truly a misfortune for all beings in the degenerate age. Mr. Huang has a grandmother who is over eighty years old, a mother in good health, young siblings, and a widow and orphan, a family of more than ten, with no means of livelihood. His wife came to Shanghai after hearing the news, grief-stricken and unable to recover, unable to rise from her illness. All who mourn the unfinished cause of Mr. Huang and sympathize with his orphaned family, after holding a meeting, discussed ways to provide for the family's future life, planning to raise 6,000 yuan in bereavement funds to purchase public bonds or treasury bonds, and use the monthly interest to barely maintain their livelihood. Next, a Buddhist memorial ceremony was held, followed by a family member reporting on Mr. Huang's history and expressing deep gratitude to everyone for raising a large sum of money.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Communications' Shanghai Telephone Bureau's Pudong cross-border telephone was originally scheduled to be removed the day before yesterday. Because the concession's transfer station is busy, it must wait until the concession's telephone company expands its "04" manual station before it can be dismantled. The branch in the city center area is currently laying cables. The details are recorded separately as follows:</p>
<p>Since the Pudong Cross-Border Machine Slow Demolition Telephone Bureau was established at the end of last month, it was originally scheduled to begin removing the 78 cross-border telephone machines in the Pudong area the day before yesterday. However, because the telephone company's transfer to the Chinese boundary's "02" manual station is unusually busy, if it is divided, it will still be connected from the central "02" manual station to the Chinese boundary's Nanshi General Bureau, and then through the Gaochang waterline to Pudong, which is inconvenient. Therefore, the Shanghai company, for the convenience of users to connect to Pudong telephones, plans to install a "04" manual station before Pudong telephones are assigned to the Telephone Bureau, specializing in the application of this after the concession calls Pudong (because Pudong cross-border telephones are mostly made to the concession), which is expected to be completed around February 10 and can be used on February 20. All Pudong's cross-border telephone machines will be completely transferred to the Telephone Bureau for operation by the end of February.</p>
<p>The laying of cables in the city center area: As for the telephone branch in the city center area, since the Ministry of Communications recruited Liang after the ministry's recruitment, it has not yet been announced. In order to facilitate the application of the telephone by the municipal government on New Year's Day, it has decided to set up 50 pairs of cables from Zhabei to the city center area. If the weather is clear, it can be completed by the end of the month. In short, the telephone in the city center area will not have any problems.</p>

<p>After performing the rituals, Chairman Wen Hongen reported, saying that today is the day of the training institute's restoration and establishment, and he felt very honored that people from all walks of life came to participate. Shanghai is an important commercial port in our country, and the need for police officers to have specialized knowledge is particularly necessary. Therefore, the local authorities specially set up a police training institute in Zhabei. Since its establishment, it has been many years. Later, due to the outbreak of the Shanghai War, the institute was temporarily suspended due to the war. Now, after several months of preparation, it has been restored. He hoped that everyone present would provide guidance from time to time to correct any shortcomings.</p>

<p>Next, Mayor Wu gave a speech, saying that today is the opening day of the 16th session of the police training institute. The police themselves have a great relationship with the entire society. Therefore, modern civilized countries all have good police officers, because the concept of "country" is organized by three elements: sovereignty, people, and land. The various relationships that people have on the land all depend on the police to maintain and rescue. We know that the greatest purpose of a country is to use laws to protect people's lives and property. However, the law is a kind of regulation, and its implementation cannot be done without the police. Therefore, from the above theory, all modern police officers should undergo considerable training, because after they have considerable knowledge and skills, they will not fail the country's trust, and the various evils in society can also be eliminated by their power, so that the country becomes stronger day by day. Therefore, the responsibility of the police is very important. I hope that you will take what I said today as a reference for the future, work hard in your duties, and not fail the original intention of setting up the training institute and the people's taxes.</p>

Today, Japan is engaged in military expansion, and a war between Japan and Russia and Japan and the United States will be difficult to avoid in the future. If a war breaks out, Britain will, for its own interests, side with the United States and Russia to contain Japan. In the end, it was said that in this crisis, our people should unite unanimously, from top to bottom, and seek self-rescue urgently.</p>
<h3 id="e159">The Gospel for Those Suffering from Madness <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Madness Specialty Hospital, located at Ren'an Lane, Guling Road in this city, has achieved remarkable success since its establishment. The hospital director, Gu Wenjun, uses a secret ancestral formula passed down through seven generations to treat madness and help people. Those who have been treated and cured are deeply grateful and sing its praises. It is reported that this month, the hospital has cured several male and female patients with madness, including Xu Ruliang from Suzhou, who was hospitalized for twenty-four days and was discharged fully recovered on the 17th. It was found that Xu was an apprentice in a certain firm. He was swindled out of 500 yuan when delivering money. The shop owner falsely accused him of embezzlement, and Xu's family paid 400 yuan to settle the matter. Unexpectedly, Xu suffered a nervous breakdown as a result and was sent to the hospital for treatment and was cured. This was a stroke of good luck amidst misfortune. Furthermore, Gao Linshi from Fujian, Sha Wangshi from Suzhou, and Shao Xieshi from Wuxi, all suffered from severe madness. They were hospitalized for one month and recovered remarkably, being discharged one after another. Additionally, Lu Shunjin, the owner of Xiexing Copper Iron Machinery Store on Sixth Avenue, suffered from severe madness and would hit anyone he saw. After being sent to the hospital for treatment, he recovered completely in less than ten days. His family took him home and expressed endless gratitude to the hospital.</p>
<h3 id="e160">Difficult to Achieve Reconciliation in the Kaisheng-Kaijue Case <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>Kaisheng, the abbot of Guo'en Temple in this city, fearing that his fellow monk Kaijue (also the abbot of Chao Yin Cave) would seize his position as abbot, took advantage of Kaijue's visit to Shanghai to collect donations. Kaisheng secretly reported him to the Buddhist Association, luring Kaijue to Caohejing and detaining him in the Vagrant Self-Reliance Institute. Meanwhile, Kaisheng went to the mountain and forcibly took over the position of abbot of Chao Yin Cave, holding it for over a year. Now, Kaijue's secular brothers have learned of this and hired a lawyer to file a complaint with the Second Special District Local Court, accusing Kaisheng of unlawful imprisonment, etc. The court issued a document to the Vagrant Self-Reliance Institute, bringing Kaijue forward for questioning. The original and accused parties were separately released on bail pending investigation and further interrogation. During the re-interrogation the other day, the lawyers of both parties requested an extension of the deadline to facilitate reconciliation. This matter has been repeatedly reported in this newspaper. It is now heard that a certain two lay Buddhists are making great efforts to mediate the matter. However, Kaijue is demanding an exorbitant sum of 15,000 yuan, while Kaisheng is only willing to pay several thousand yuan, making it difficult to reach an agreement. Moreover, Kaisheng, in view of Kaijue's various illegal acts on the mountain in the past, which led to his expulsion by his master, feels that if a large sum of money is given to him this time, he may again plot to seize his position as abbot of Guo'en Temple. Kaijue must therefore sign a written guarantee. Therefore, this matter is still difficult to reconcile amicably, and the court has already made some overtures. It is feared that it will be difficult to achieve the goal of withdrawing the lawsuit.</p>

<p>The former commander of the Suzhou Self-Defense Corps, the notorious bandit leader Quan Liting (also known as Guangyi) from Anhui, and Wei Zizhen (also known as Zizhong and Wei San), both committed numerous crimes in Anhui. The Anhui Provincial Government issued arrest warrants for them. They fled to Shanghai and resided at No. 3, Siming Village, Fuxu Road in the French Concession. Liu Junqing, the Chinese detective chief of the Old Zhabei Police Station in the Public Concession, learned of this. On the evening of the 3rd of this month, he sent his colleague Zhang Kewen from Anhui to Quan and Wei's residence to investigate the truth. Quan and others preemptively reported to the French Police Station, accusing Zhang of extortion of 300 yuan, requesting detention and investigation. The police chief approved the request and sent detectives to investigate, taking Zhang and Quan and Wei to the police station together. Later, the Old Zhabei Police Station sent detectives to take Quan and Wei to the First Special District Court for questioning and detention, awaiting notification from the Anhui Provincial Government to send personnel to Shanghai to extradite them. The French Police Station investigated Zhang Kewen and found that he was indeed suspected of extortion. He was sent to the Second Special District Court for prosecution. Zhang hired lawyer Jiang Yiping to defend him, and the British Police Station sent the two plaintiffs, Quan and Wei, to court for cross-examination. The court announced the conclusion of the trial, ordering Zhang to pay a deposit of 500 yuan and await the scheduled sentencing. Quan and others were taken back to the British Police Station by detectives for detention. These details have been previously reported. The other day, the sentencing date arrived. The defendant Zhang Kewen arrived in court to await instructions. At 2:30 PM, Judge Wu Fanglian presided over the first criminal court and sentenced Zhang Kewen to 30 days of detention for attempting to unlawfully obtain property from others through extortion, with a two-year suspension. The number of days of pre-trial detention will be credited at a rate of two days for one day of detention. During the appeal period, the defendant will remain on the original bail.</p>

<p>The members of the departing group include seven men and women: Shen Yiqian, Yu Chuangshuo, Huang Zhaochang, Gu Tingpeng, Mo Pu, Wang Bin, and Zhang Yi. The group is led by Shen Yiqian, who is from Jinshan, Jiangsu. He used to study at a Japanese school in this city and had many Japanese friends. His study at the Shanghai Art School was also introduced by a Japanese person. However, since the September 18th Incident, Mr. Shen, seeing the national hatred as irreconcilable, severed ties with all his Japanese friends. The teachers and students of the Shanghai Art School all praised him. His resolute organization of the National Crisis Propaganda Group to engage in practical work is a model for young people.</p>

On October 25th of this year, at noon, he was lured away from the front of the school by Wang Deyu, the son of his stepfather's elder brother. He was taken to the desolate suburbs of the Xuanjia House of the Longhua Cement Factory, where he and his accomplice, Zhou Ayuan from Jiangyin, hacked Fu Gen to death in an attempt to seize his property. After the crime, the perpetrators fled. Later, the Shanghai Public Security Bureau sent detectives to arrest Zhou and Wang at No. 107 Zhangjiabang Road, Jumen Road in South Shanghai and in Nanxiang. The French Police learned that the victim in this case was lured away in the Concession and that the case should be handled by the Concession court. They sent detectives to the Public Security Bureau to bring Zhou and Wang back for investigation and transferred them to the Second Special District Court, prosecuting them for premeditated murder under Article 284 of the Criminal Code. The two perpetrators confessed to plotting the murder. These details have been previously reported. The other day, Judge Wu Fanglian conducted a hearing in the first criminal court. The two perpetrators confessed as before. Subsequently, under the defense of lawyer Yu Zhongluo, who was appointed by the court to provide pro bono defense for the defendants, the court declared the debate concluded and scheduled sentencing for the 20th.

<p>The Xinhua Bookstore at No. 160 Jiaotong Road, Shandong Road, published a book in September of this year called "A Comedy of Love and Money, Part 1." Since its publication, it has become very popular and sold widely. In less than three months, over 3,000 copies have been sold. Subsequently, Deng Hailin, a Chinese detective of the Political Department of the General Police Station, heard that the contents of the book were obscene. On the 10th of last month, he went to the Xinhua Bookstore and obtained a copy of "A Comedy of Love and Money." After taking it back to the police station and examining it, he found that the language was lewd and that the description of sexual intercourse was particularly detailed, which would induce sexual desire and harm public morals. He reported this to the police chief and specially requested the First Special District Court to summon the bookstore manager, Zhu Dabai, to the second criminal court yesterday morning. The police lawyer, Qian Xunjiu, presented the case, stating that he was prosecuting under Article 251 of the Criminal Code for disseminating or selling obscene literature and requested that the law be strictly enforced. He then presented the book as evidence. The defendant, Zhu Dabai, hired lawyer Jiang Chiping, who argued that the book "A Comedy of Love and Money" had been republished and released on the 25th of last month, and that all the obscene points had been automatically revised, and that a statement had been added to the preface. He then presented the revised book for inspection. Judge Deng Baosun examined the report and ordered the debate to begin. After the debate between the two lawyers, the court ordered that the case be adjourned until Tuesday of next week for sentencing.</p>

<p>Yuan Can, also known as Yuan Chang, the abbot of the Sanmei Nunnery outside the Small South Gate, felt that the nunnery's electricity bill was too high. In July of this year, he colluded with a craftsman named Zhang Ziming to remove an electric wire when the China Merchants Electric Company was modifying the electric meter, so that less current would flow, stealing more than 50 yuan of electricity each month. The company became suspicious and sent an investigation team to investigate and find out the truth. They requested the local court to detain Zhang Ziming, while Yuan Chang fled at the time, but was also detained later. He was subsequently released on bail. However, this case has now been prosecuted. Yesterday morning, Judge Zhang Peiming opened the eleventh court to hear the case. Yuan Can did not attend the hearing. Only Zhang Ziming testified that the electric meter was installed on a partition wall and may have fallen off due to vibration, and that he was not suspected of colluding to steal electricity. Witness Ding Hanchun testified that, according to his experience, this may have happened, but it was not within his duties, so he could not confirm it. According to Ling Kejun, the electric meter was installed, and he went to stamp it with a lead seal. He did not inspect the interior at the time, but said that it could not have fallen off unless it was removed by human force. The judge, noting that Yuan Can had not arrived, ordered that the bail be submitted after the case, and that the hearing be reconvened later. The defendant was remanded in custody.</p>

<p>Recently, people from the news and legal professions, noting that the city's newspapers suspend publication during the Lunar New Year, resulting in a complete cutoff of all news, felt that those who care about national affairs and pay attention to social conditions were all feeling a sense of silence. Therefore, in order to communicate news from all sides, a New Year's Daily newspaper called "Shanghai News" will be published. It is scheduled to be published from New Year's Day, with one large sheet per day, and will be suspended on the 4th. In addition to publishing speeches by famous people every day, it will also include a large amount of domestic telegrams and local news from the city. The news reports will be written by specially assigned reporters, and will be concise, insightful, and accurate. The circulation is expected to be large, and the advertising rates will be very low. Currently, the number of advertisers is very enthusiastic. Although it is still in the preparation stage, it has already achieved such results, which is quite commendable. The office address has been determined as No. 4, Dongpuyi Lane, Qipu Road, telephone number 46606.</p>

<p>Xu Yongyuan, a Chinese detective of the Hongkou Police Station, previously arrested two robbers from Jiangbei, Zhu Mengyu and Qi Zhengbao, in a straw hut in the Jinjia House on Avenyi Road. A pistol and five bullets were found and taken to the police station, and they were sent to the First Special District Court for investigation. Yesterday, Judge Wu Zehan continued the trial in the third criminal court. The police lawyer, Zhang Tianyin, stated that during the investigation, it was found that the defendant Zhu Mengyu, at 10:30 PM on August 7th of last year, colluded with Xu Deqing and Shen Fulin, who are still at large, and Yang Chunfa (also known as Liang Yongquan), who had already been convicted and sentenced for carrying military firearms, to rob a certain cigarette and paper shop at No. 957 Donghan Bili Road. Shen fired the gun and killed the shop owner. Zhu and Liang Yongquan were lookouts outside the door. He and the police detectives went to the scene to reenact the locations where they stood during the robbery. Qi Zhengbao denied the charges and requested a hearing. Zhu Mengyu confessed without denying and said that Qi Zhengbao did not go. Judge Wu ordered that they remain in custody and that the investigation be verified again later.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Cigarette Exchange Industry Association, in order to comply with the order of the Shanghai Treasure Tobacco and Alcohol License Tax Collection Office to rectify and collect taxes in accordance with the regulations, and because the burden on the Chinese industry was at stake, specially invited responsible representatives from various districts of the Chinese area of this city at 2:00 PM the other day to hold a meeting to discuss relief policies. Committee members Qiu Tanglin, Chai Yasheng, Zhang Bingyuan, Wang Kuiyuan, Teng Zhixiang, and representatives from various districts, totaling more than fifty people, attended. Chen Liangyu, the chairman, announced the opening of the meeting, performed the rituals, and reported on the letter from the tax office. Next, the proposed solutions were discussed. It was generally agreed that the industry in the Chinese area has already effectively extinguished local tobacco. They are currently engaged in the exchange of cigarettes, which is a small business with meager profits. The various taxes and levies, if paid according to the old rules, are already a struggle to maintain. Since the January 28th Incident, all industries have declined, and business has not yet recovered. The industry has fallen further behind. With the recent increase in the unified cigarette tax and the failure to unify the increase in price, if the license fee is collected in accordance with the regulations, small shops with limited capital will find it difficult to bear the burden. The chairman should be asked to find a way to remedy the situation. The following methods were decided upon by the public: (1) Chen Liangyu and Shen Weiting were publicly recommended to negotiate with the tax authorities to reach a proper solution and continue to collect taxes according to the old rules, so as to avoid disputes and benefit both the tax authorities and the merchants; (2) If the tax authorities disregard the merchants' difficulties, they will only have to follow the procedures of the autumn of last year; (3) If the goal is not achieved, they would rather sacrifice together. The meeting was adjourned at 5:00 PM after the resolutions were passed by all members.</p>

It was decided that: (A) A letter should be sent to the railway bureau to petition for this; (B) Zheng Dongshan, Fei Liangheng, Huang Qiujiang, and Liang Chunlin should be publicly elected as representatives.

<p>The Wing On Company on Nanjing Road was suddenly stormed by a gang of robbers at dusk on the 6th of this month. On the third and fourth floors, they pulled out pistols, preventing the company's delivery staff from raising the alarm. They robbed the money bag containing 18,000 yuan that the staff was carrying and fled. One of the robbers, Yan Amao, was caught on the spot, and a pistol was found on him. Subsequently, Huang Yingjie and Lang Chengpei, detectives from the Old Zhabei Police Station, together with Chief Detective You Agen, arrested three more accomplices, Feng Zuowen, Hu Songshan, and Feng's mistress, Pan Meimei. They were all sent to the First Special District Local Court and ordered to be detained pending investigation and trial. These details have been previously reported. It is now learned that the mastermind behind this case was actually Hu Songshan. Hu is from Guangdong. He used to work at the Wing On Company, but was later dismissed and became unemployed. Therefore, he had a deep</p>

<p>Although he had recently been employed in the foreign goods department of the New World Company, his old hatred had not been quelled, and he was always thinking of revenge. Half a year ago, he decided to gather a crowd to commit robbery. Because most of the staff members of Wing On were from Guangdong, the accomplices should also be from Guangdong to make it easier to carry out the plan. He invited Feng Zuowen to cooperate. After Feng secretly plotted several times, he realized that two people were too few. Feng then invited two other people and swore an oath over wine, vowing not to change their minds halfway. However, after the oath, the two disappeared without a trace. Hu and Feng knew that those people were not reliable and planned to find new comrades. Feng's mistress, Pan Meimei, introduced Yan Amao and a "Big Brother" to them. They rented Room 439 of the Dongya Hotel and met with Feng and Hu to</p>

<p>On the 5th of this month, the "Big Brother" handed over two pistols and decided that the next evening, when the company's cashiers were sending the cash collected from various departments to the general accounting office, they would intercept it halfway. However, Hu felt that the "Big Brother" was not one of them and must have different intentions. He was deeply worried that after the robbery, he would swallow the proceeds alone. Therefore, he secretly instructed Feng to monitor him in secret. Unfortunately, Hu had foresight, but Feng did not take precautions. When they were about to commit the robbery, the "Big Brother" made an excuse to lure Feng away. He and Yan Amao, each carrying firearms, mixed into the company. After obtaining the huge sum of money, he fled first, leaving Yan to be captured on the spot, while he</p>

<p>Still without a trace, only that Feng at the time did not suspect that Da Age would "forget the well after drinking the water" (abandon a tool after it has served its purpose), so he went to the New New Hotel and opened room 418 to sit and wait with Hu. However, after waiting for a long time without seeing his accomplices return, he went with his mistress, Sister Pan, to Da Age's home at 82 Rue Wagner in the French Concession to visit. Unexpectedly, at this time, Chief Detective You and others, based on Yan Amao's confession, were searching the house. Because Da Age had not returned home, they remained stationed there. When Feng and his wife arrived and were questioned and found to be accomplices, they were immediately arrested. They then went to the New New Hotel and apprehended Hu Songshan. They further searched Hu's office at the New New Company, and seized from a drawer</p>

<p>The letters included some in which bandits invited Hu to rob the Wing On Company, others in which Hu was threatened for refusing, and still others in which Hu, under his own name, reported to the Wing On Company, containing elements of self-confession. According to Hu's confession, the letters were all written by him in advance to serve as evidence after the robbery was discovered, proving that the robbery was not his intention, thereby mitigating his guilt. The meticulousness of his scheme truly left no detail unattended, and his premeditation showed that he had been planning this for a long time. Yesterday, the police escorted the bandits to the First Special District Local Court for interrogation. Police lawyer Zhang Shizhu explained the circumstances of the defendants' robbery plan and requested severe punishment. Judge Feng interrogated each bandit separately and then ordered them to be remanded in custody for continued interrogation at a later date.</p>

<p>The Yangjing district of Pudong has recently seen increasing commercial activity and a surge in population. However, modern fire-fighting equipment is still lacking, and the traditional wooden water dragons are no longer suitable. As a result, a major fire broke out in the town this summer, causing a huge disaster with losses exceeding 100,000 yuan. Wen Hongen, the head of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, considered fire-fighting equipment extremely important and closely related to local security, so he appointed Hong Qi, the head of the bureau's Second Section, and instructed Dong Zhihe, the director of the fire-fighting division, to urge the Yangjing Town Fire Brigade to actively reorganize and re-elect Chen Quan, a man of outstanding reputation and familiar with fire-fighting conditions, as a standing committee member responsible for all internal and external affairs of the association. It is reported that the association has already purchased a new-style "Talice" (transliteration) pump fire engine and 4,000 feet of hose. When the new engine was demonstrated the other day, the entire town, young and old, went to watch, creating a lively scene with unanimous praise. As for the association building, plans have been made, requiring over 10,000 yuan, and construction will begin soon.</p>

<p>In the area surrounding Liangyi Lane on Derun Road, within the jurisdiction of the Third Precinct of the Fifth District of Zhabei, because it was originally wasteland, no fewer than sixty households of poor people had built houses to live in. Feng Zhaonian, a 31-year-old man from Yancheng who buys and sells old goods, lived in straw hut number 56. Unexpectedly, at about 12:20 AM yesterday morning, a fire suddenly broke out at Feng Zhaonian's house, immediately spreading to neighboring houses. The neighbors were awakened from their dreams, fleeing in panic, shouting loudly, creating chaos and disorder. At that time, the nearby Weiyang New Stage had not yet ended its performance. Upon hearing the fire alarm, the audience scrambled to escape from the theater, with countless people being pushed to the ground, and cries of distress also rising. When the Third Precinct of the Fifth District received the report, they quickly dispatched patrol officers to the scene to maintain order, which gradually stabilized. At the same time, the Hongzhen Fire Brigade also received the news and quickly dispatched fire trucks to the scene to put out the fire. However, by this time, the fire had become uncontrollable, and with the aid of the wind, the fire spread even more fiercely, also affecting building number 4 in Liangyi Lane. The firefighters quickly secured the lane, and surrounded the fire on all sides to extinguish it. It was not until around 2:00 AM that the fire was finally extinguished. As a result, 54 straw huts were burned down, and the disaster victims sat on the ground, homeless, exposed to the wind and cold, in a state of utter misery. Feng Zhaonian, the source of the fire, was arrested on the spot by the Fifth Precinct of the Fifth District, and taken back for interrogation. As for the cause of the fire, it was said that Feng's younger sister, Xiaolan, was playing around with someone and accidentally knocked over a kerosene lamp, and the sparks splashed onto the straw. Afterward, Feng Xiaolan fled without a trace and is now being sought.</p>

<p>After the Gongfa Company Riyue Bank and the Great World Amusement Savings Department collapsed in the winter of the 19th year of the Republic due to the death of the founder, Huang Chu Jiu, owing debts of more than 3 million yuan, the creditors filed lawsuits to recover their money. Huang's family handed over all public and private property for compensation. Accountants were appointed for liquidation, and later the former French Concession Court allocated 20% of the debt. After the case was taken over by the Second Special District Court, due to the complexity of the case and the time required for the cleanup, no allocations have been made yet. Lawyers commissioned by the creditors, such as Yan Luqing, have repeatedly submitted requests for the auction of all Huang's real estate to repay the debts, as reported in previous newspapers. The court has auctioned off five properties of the debtor Gongfa Company and Huang, including the Zhizu Lu on Avenue Edward VII, the Jiufu Company at the intersection of Route Mercier and Route Park, Rongqing Lane on Route Joffre, Qiaoxi of Xicang in the city, and the Jiuzhi Xiaozhu on West Lake in Hangzhou, along with the land. They were auctioned off publicly at the execution office the other day and purchased by the wealthy merchant Li Guangdi. Together with the previous auction of six properties including the Huang Chu Jiu Hospital on Longmen Road, the total auction price was 227,000 yuan. One property, the Tongde Hospital building and land on Route de la Soeur, was originally scheduled to be auctioned on the same day, but the auction was suspended due to another lawsuit entanglement. It will be sold after the problem is resolved. At 3 PM the other day, the lawyers representing both the creditors and debtors were summoned to the court, and Judge Cao opened the court to announce the sale price, seek opinions on the allocation, and the accountant reported on the progress of the cleanup.</p>

<p>Guests included Mayor Wu Tiecheng (represented by Pan Gongzhan), Director of the Municipal Education Bureau Pan Gongzhan, as well as Shi Liangcai, Lin Kanghou, Wang Yiting, Gui Yanfang, Qian Xinzhi, Zhu Qinglan (represented by Zha Liangzhao), Chu Huiseng, Huang Renzhi, Jiang Wenyu, Wang Guanyi, Huang Jingwan, Pang Jingzhou, Xu Qianlin, Liu Wang Liming, and over a hundred others.</p>

<p>After the meeting began, Shi Liangcai gave a report, stating roughly that after the January 28th Incident in Shanghai, the city was devastated and filled with vagrants, posing a hidden danger to the area. The gentlemen of the Shanghai Municipal Local Maintenance Association were deeply concerned and decided to establish a People's Education Institute in Zhabei to accommodate them. They allocated 100,000 yuan from the national salvation donation as a foundation. After the establishment of the Shanghai Municipal Association, they continued to prepare for the establishment, organized a board of directors, and first allocated funds to build new houses on the old site of the Zhabei Xiqin Institute. It was completed this spring. The institute had been operated by Wang Binyan and other enthusiastic charitable gentlemen in Zhabei for many years. Wang Yiting transferred 177 people from the former Hunan Temporary Shelter for the Poor, and the China Women and Children's Relief Association transferred 20 male students, together with the original residents of the Xiqin Institute, and those successively admitted to the institute, totaling over 200 people. Over the past year, there have been times of increase and decrease. As of now, there are actually 158 students in the institute. Director Zhu Yaqiang is dedicated to education and has many years of experience in administration. He studied agronomy in France and is willing to give up other careers to engage in practical work of saving people. The process of the institute's founding is roughly as described above. Next, Gao Yanyun and Gui Yanfang reported on the institute's affairs and financial situation. The speeches were omitted for length.</p>
<h3 id="e198">Pan Gongzhan's Speech <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>Next, Mayor's representative Pan Gongzhan gave a speech, saying, "Ladies and gentlemen, you have come here to attend the founding ceremony of the Education Institute, and I hope that many of you will see the desolate scene of the Eight Character Bridge, not far from here, left over from the January 28th Incident. Due to the efforts of the former Local Maintenance Association (now the Local Association), the army was supplied and refugees were accommodated during the January 28th Incident. Knowing the importance of education, this institute was established. In the past, this institute was originally a vagrant training center, because the organizers knew that the people's education was indispensable, so on the one hand, education was implemented, and on the other hand, production was implemented, so that the people could gain technical knowledge, which is more beneficial than ordinary schools. The municipal government, within the possible scope, should vigorously promote it, and hope that all sectors of the community can provide assistance. This is what the mayor instructed me to say. At the same time, I heard in the institute's song, 'Do not forget the prestige of the 19th Route Army.' However, the 19th Route Army is now pro-Japanese and tolerant of the Communists, an illegal combination, and there is no need to commemorate it any longer. I hope that the two words '19th' will be changed to 'Resist Japan,' because it was not only the 19th Route Army that resisted Japan during the Shanghai Incident. Only the army that resists Japan is worthy of commemoration, otherwise there is no need to commemorate it." Next, Liu Wang Liming gave a speech, which was not recorded due to its length. At 4:30 PM, the director led a tour of the work products of various departments, including paper boxes, bronzeware, rattan ware, woodwork, and sewing. It is said that the institute will also add an agricultural department. It was not until 5 PM that the meeting dispersed.</p>

<p>The China Relief Association has specially established the All-Purpose Pharmaceutical Bureau, collecting secret recipes of remarkable effectiveness and compounding various pills and powders, with the aim of helping the world. Only the cost of the medicine is charged. If public organizations formally request them in writing, they will be provided free of charge. Each type is limited to one dose, to indicate restrictions.

<p>The houses in Mingde Lane on Avenue Joffre are the property of Chen Mingde, a Chinese, and managed by the Shanghai Bank Real Estate Department. The landlord, in the current economic depression, notified the tenants of a 30% rent increase. The tenants panicked upon hearing the news. In addition to organizing the Mingde Lane branch of the Municipal Association to request the landlord to waive the rent increase, for the sake of peace, the tenants have elected representatives to negotiate and mediate with the landlord several times. As a result, the landlord waived 20% of the increase, and the tenants agreed to a 10% increase. However, because the landlord insisted that the outstanding rent must be paid in full, the tenants agreed to pay it back monthly. The landlord demanded that the rent increase take effect from December, while the tenants requested that it be delayed until March 1, 1934. Therefore, the landlord refused. However, the tenants all believe that at this time, there are only news of rent reductions, and very few news of rent increases. Now the tenants are willing to increase the rent by 10%, which is already a concession. If it is necessary to</p>

<p>Wang Changsheng, a 35-year-old man from Gaoyou, had a wife, two sons, and a daughter. His wife, Tang, was 39 years old, his daughter, Fufen, was 9 years old, his son, Songyuan, was 7 years old, and his youngest son, Xiaosanzi, was only 2 years old. The family of five originally lived a very poor life by farming in their hometown. Admiring the wealth of Shanghai and the ease of making a living, they moved to Shanghai as a family in July of this year, building a reed shed on the eastern end of the Kuang Field on Dongchang Road in Pudong to live in, a very pitiful sight. Changsheng himself was not strong, and his wife and four children all depended on him for survival. He was not strong enough to do manual labor, so he had to go to the docks every day to pick up garbage or scavenge in various places to make a living. Sometimes he had nothing to gain, and the family had no food. Their inhuman life was extremely miserable. The other day in the afternoon, Changsheng again went to pick up things in the garbage bins in various alleys in Puxi. He found a string of pufferfish roe in a garbage bin near the 16th Pier, which was still very fresh. Changsheng, thinking that his family had not had any delicacies for a long time, was delighted to see it, so he took out the fish roe, brought it home, and rinsed it once. His wife had advised him to cook it tomorrow, but Changsheng was drooling and did not listen. He went to the market to buy some greens, fried tofu, and a little bit of soybeans, and cooked them with the pufferfish roe in a pot. At dinner time at around 6:00 PM that night, the family gathered together to eat it heartily. At first, they were all right, but by 9:00 or 10:00 PM, all five of them were poisoned, their bodies numb, their abdomens swollen, and they fell unconscious. Changsheng had eaten the most, so he soon died of asphyxiation. The youngest son, Xiaosanzi, had weak resistance and also died after his father. There were still three people, all on the verge of death. The neighbors immediately reported to the Third District Public Security Bureau. Chief Zhang immediately sent patrol officers to the scene and urgently carried the three dead people to the Pudong Hospital for treatment. At the same time, a bowl of uneaten pufferfish roe was found in the shed, seemingly left over for tomorrow. The police took it back to the district as evidence. After the three people arrived at the hospital, the doctor simultaneously poured medicine down their throats to make them vomit. After a long time, only Tang was able to gradually wake up. The other two children remained unconscious. Yesterday morning, the doctor saw that Tang was able to speak and immediately notified the Third District to have her carried to the district. After Chief Zhang questioned her in detail about the poisoning, seeing that Tang was out of danger, he ordered her to be carried back home. The two children in the hospital, however, because the treatment was ineffective, became even worse, so they were also sent back to their home. The nine-year-old girl, Fufen, died of asphyxiation at 3:00 PM. The seven-year-old boy, Songyuan, was also still in critical condition. After this incident occurred, it caused a sensation far and wide. The curious flocked to the mouth of the reed shed to watch, causing a huge crowd. However, the three corpses, large and small, were lying to the left and right in the shed, and one child was also unconscious. Only Tang was left alive, but when she looked back at the great disaster that had befallen her family, she also wanted to die. The scene in the small shed was extremely tragic, and the spectators were all saddened. The dead are gone, but the living not only have a worrying future, but also do not have the strength to pay for coffins and funerals. Therefore, Chief Zhang notified the charity hall to provide coffins and collect the bodies. At the same time, he instructed the neighborhood chief to report the three corpses to the court for examination.</p>

<p>Completely paying the outstanding rent, and insisting on the rent increase, truly disregard the pain of the tenants. Therefore, the tenants are preparing to resist. In addition to regularly convening meetings of all tenants to deal with the situation, they are also submitting the landlord's oppression to the party and government organs and various groups to request assistance.</p>

<p>Victory Brand Embroidery Glue is Popular Throughout Shanghai. Since the Victory Brand Embroidery Glue has been exclusively distributed by the Dahua Department Store, Room 617, 6th Floor, Mainland Department Store, Nanjing Road, it has won unanimous praise from all walks of life in society and has taken the place of embroidery. However, some unscrupulous merchants, seeing the increasing sales of the glue, have specifically imitated inferior products or distributed imitation goods, confusing the market and deceiving themselves and others. However, these inferior goods are not only pale in color and dull in light, but also completely fade after washing with water, and the poor quality of the materials is even more of an issue. Therefore, we sincerely hope that those who love art will pay close attention and distinguish carefully. The old-brand Victory Embroidery Glue sold by Dahua Department Store has the English brand name " " printed on each tube, and the color is bright and will not change for a long time. The former Dahua Department Store has specially prepared a large number of samples and drawn drafts for those who value credit to study. Enclose three dimes (30 cents) for postage and they will be sent. As the winter solstice approaches and the New Year is imminent, people from all walks of life in this city are rushing to various distribution points to order gifts and various decorative items.</p>
<p>Imitations of Laiyang Pear Paste are also on the Market. Yicheng Company on Tongfu Road in this city distributes Laiyang Pear Paste with the "Round Longevity" trademark produced by Dongya Company of Yantai. Sales have been very strong since the beginning of winter. It is said that imitations of the "Round Longevity" trademark Laiyang Pear Paste have been found on the market recently. The manager of the company believes that pear paste is not a valuable tonic, and each can is only sold for five dimes (50 cents). It is unscrupulous to want to sell imitation products under the guise of the brand, which is a loss of conscience. Genuine Laiyang Pear Paste is indeed different from ordinary pear paste on the market. Buyers must identify the "Round Longevity" trademark produced by Dongya Company of Yantai to avoid being mistaken. As for the efficacy of this pear paste, once you try it, you will know that the company is not boasting.</p>
<p>Yuanshentai Leather Goods Price Reduction. Since the reorganization and opening of the Yuanshentai Leather Goods Bureau on Hankou Road and Henan Road, it has been selling high-quality coarse and fine leather goods at the lowest prices, with a wide variety of colors and everything you need. It has won the trust of people from all walks of life. Now that the weather is getting colder, people from all walks of life need to add leather goods. If you buy them from the Bureau, you will get unexpected discounts.</p>

<h3 id="e209">Special Article: Preface to "Key to Understanding Characters" by Ding Fubao <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>To deeply study the writing systems of European and American countries, one must read Latin. This is because one must trace back to the origin of their character creation. If this is the case for Western writing, how could Chinese writing be any different? To trace back the construction of Chinese characters, clerical script and standard script are insufficient. One must seek the origins in seal script and bronze script to achieve true understanding. The person who compiled the great compendium of seal script, bronze script, and ancient characters was Xu Shen, during the Later Han Dynasty, in his "Shuowen Jiezi." Xie Qikun aptly said, "The 'Shuowen' is the foremost book in the world. Reading all the books in the world without reading the 'Shuowen' is equivalent to not reading at all." This is similar to saying that one who studies Western writing without reading Latin will ultimately be unable to understand the origins and development of Western writing. However, in this day and age, it is not necessary for all students to become experts in philology. It is only necessary to have a basic understanding of the errors in the transition to clerical script, the general principles of the Six Methods of Character Construction, and the construction of characters. Han Changli of the Tang Dynasty said, "Those who compose literary works should have a basic understanding of characters." This is what he meant.</p>
<p>However, when scholars first read the "Shuowen," they often stop halfway because the writing is ancient, obscure, dry, and uninteresting. Therefore, philologists compile the 540 radicals, adding brief annotations, or compile introductory books for beginners, or create various mnemonic verses. Although the names are numerous, the intention is to make it easier for beginners. However, readers still find it dull and uninteresting, and put it aside before finishing the book. Some are forced by strict fathers and teachers to graduate, but they find it as tasteless as chewing wax and still cannot enter the realm of philology. Why is this? It is because the compilers, although experts in Xu's scholarship, have never paid attention to what is called teaching methodology. Presuming upon myself, I intended to compile an introductory book to Xu's scholarship thirty years ago. At first, I thought it would be very easy. But as soon as I put pen to paper, it was like scooping sand from the sea, boundless and without end. Only then did I realize how difficult it was. Afterwards, I destroyed the drafts three times and revised them five times, exhausting my energy and spending my days, and still could not complete the book after more than thirty years. So, I entrusted a bundle of remaining drafts to Shen Boyuan to continue the work. After a long time, Boyuan also declined, saying that it was not easy to edit, and returned the drafts to me. They have been hidden in my trunk for another year. This autumn, Mr. Jiang Zhuzhuang said that the teachers of philology in various schools are troubled by the lack of a book that beginners can quickly use, and he urged me to complete the manuscript as soon as possible. I was not satisfied with the old drafts, so I racked my brains and searched diligently, and established a different system. Sometimes I forgot to eat while facing the food, or got up in the middle of the night. In this way, for three days and nights, I finally abandoned the old drafts and edited using the circular teaching method, naming it "Key to Understanding Characters." Alas, I am already sixty years old, and my energy is declining. This book was not completed thirty years ago, but is being completed today, in the twilight of my life. It can also be said that I do not know that old age is approaching. I especially wonder whether this will truly be a shortcut and beneficial to those who are beginning to study the "Shuowen."</p>
<p>At the beginning of this book is the "Preliminary Compilation." Lu Shiheng said, "Nothing is greater than words in explaining things, and nothing is better than pictures in preserving forms." I believe that when teaching beginners, words and pictures should be combined. Therefore, I have selected a number of characters, all of which are presented with illustrations to arouse interest. I imagine that at the beginning of character creation, it must have been like this. The illustrations and annotations are all taken from "Glimpses into the Six Methods" and "Elementary Steps in Philology." I hereby acknowledge this and dare not take credit for myself.</p>
<p>Mountain Man Luo Liangfeng painted the "Diagram of the Shuowen System" for Gui Weigu, a scholar of the Ming Dynasty, depicting eight people. The oldest is Xu Shen. Flanking him on the left and right are Jiang Shi and Yan Zhitui. Following the three sages are Li Yangbing. Those who follow behind, as if whispering together, are the Xu Xuan and Xu Kai brothers. The one dressed as a Taoist priest is Zhang You. The one with one eye and one lame foot is Wu Qiuyan (the above is from Zhang Xun's postscript). There are also inscriptions by Lu Wenchao, Wang Niansun, Zhang Xun, Weng Fanggang, Ding Jie, Gui Fu, etc. It is truly a dramatic and precious relic of historical transmission. Therefore, the portraits and the original inscriptions are all phototyped and included in the "Preliminary Compilation" so that scholars of Xu's scholarship throughout the country can see this diagram and naturally feel admiration. The original manuscript of the diagram is worth more than a thousand gold coins and is now in the possession of Mr. Zhou Meiquan. I am grateful to Mr. Zhou for generously allowing it to be printed and widely circulated. I hereby record this to ensure that I do not forget.</p>
<p>This book is edited using the circular teaching method and is divided into four weeks, with each week divided into five categories: 1. General Introduction to the "Shuowen": a general discussion of the outline of the "Shuowen." 2. Clerical Transformation: From seal script to clerical script, the essence of the Six Methods was almost completely destroyed. To understand the original intentions of the ancients in creating characters, one should first know the flaws of the clerical transformation. 3. The Six Methods: The Six Methods are the foundation of character creation. Indicative, pictographic, phonetic loan, and associative composition are the four forms, on which there is no disagreement. Semantic association and borrowing are the two uses, on which there are many different opinions. Here, the aim is to adopt a compromise to dispel all doubts for the reader. 4. Corner of the "Shuowen": The complete "Shuowen" has more than 9,000 characters. Here, the aim is to briefly describe the most superficial and interesting ones for the purpose of learning by analogy. 5. The Deeds of Xu Jun: to not forget one's ancestors when discussing the classics, and also as a means of discussing the world and valuing friendship.</p>
<p>At the end of this book is the "Postliminary Compilation," which selects the essence of various books, in three categories: 1. "Original Preface to the 'Shuowen,'" with annotations by Mr. Wang Guansan in one volume. Wang's annotations extract the best from the Duan and Gui families and have his own solid insights. It is truly the most complete commentary on Xu's preface. 2. "Preface to the Categories of the 'Shuowen'" in two volumes by Xu Cuo of the Southern Tang Dynasty, modeled after the "Preface to the Trigrams" of the "Book of Changes." It strings the "Shuowen" radicals together, deducing the reasons for the sequential generation of the 540 characters. Although there are occasional inversions, omissions, and forced interpretations, it is still a good book for reading the radicals. 3. "Inquiries into the 'Shuowen' with Corrections" in one volume by Gu Guangqi, correcting the errors in Yan Kejun's "Collated Commentary on the 'Shuowen.'" Lei Jun said that Gu's corrections are meticulously detailed, unexpected, and yet convincing, which is a fair assessment. If readers can graduate from these three, they will not only enter the gate of Xu's scholarship, but will have truly ascended to its inner chambers.</p>
<p>If a person's brainpower is used for the same thing for a long time, it will inevitably become tiresome. Therefore, it is advisable to change the kinds of things to relieve it. In this way, the scene will be refreshed, and the spirit of research will also be invigorated. This is why the circular teaching method was established. If the five categories in the four weeks of this book are combined class by class, each category will easily become tiresome to read and will not be able to be completed. This is why there is also the division into four weeks. Every time a scholar reads one week, he can gain considerable knowledge in five categories. By the time he finishes four weeks, he will no longer be an outsider. Moreover, there is also the mutual assistance of the "Preliminary Compilation" and "Postliminary Compilation."</p>
<p>The system of this book was roughly determined in three days and nights, as described above. Editing according to this should be unhindered. But who knew that there was still a major difficulty that could not be resolved, namely in the phonetic loan in the first week's "Six Methods." Xu Jun's original preface said, "Borrowing refers to those characters that originally do not exist, but rely on sound to represent things, such as 'ling' and 'zhang.'" The philologists of ancient and modern times who have discussed borrowing have numbered in the dozens, but their theories are mostly far-fetched and do not know the original meaning. Although they have constructed many betel nuts, there are more forced interpretations. In reality, no one can know Xu's meaning. I pondered and thought about it repeatedly, unable to find a definite solution. In this way, another day and night passed. Then, suddenly, I realized something and said, "I've got it! I've got it!" Zheng Kangcheng and Xu Jun were contemporaries, and his annotations to the "Three Rites" also quoted the "Shuowen." If Zheng's theories are used to understand Xu's theories, they must deeply grasp the matter. Therefore, I examined the "Preface to Explaining the Classics," which quoted Zheng's theory on borrowing, saying, "In haste, when there is no character, it is borrowed by using a similar or homophonous character, aiming to be close to it." "In haste, when there is no character" is the same as Xu's "originally there is no character." "It is borrowed by using a similar or homophonous character, aiming to be close to it" is the same as Xu's "rely on sound to represent things." Only the two characters "cu" and "ben" in clerical script are easily mistaken due to their similar forms, so "cu" was erroneously changed to "ben." For more than a thousand years, philologists have been unaware of the error in the text and have forced an explanation, resulting in increasingly complex and far-fetched theories. Now, based on Zheng's theory, it is corrected to "originally there is no character," which suddenly resonates with people's hearts. Guanzi said, "Think about it and be grateful for it, and the spirits will communicate with you." It is not the power of the spirits, but the extreme of the essence. Is this not what I am talking about today?</p>
<p>Mr. Wu Zhihui believes that "ling zhang" is the erroneous writing of "ling liang," and his theory is precise. The full text is detailed in the "Supplement to the Gu Lin" and in this book. It roughly says that "ling" is to issue commands. By extension, it becomes the "ling" in county magistrate, commander, to order, and laws. "Zhang" means long duration. By extension, it becomes the "zhang" in to grow, young and old, county head, and family head, all of which are semantic association. Semantic association is due to meaning, and borrowing is due to sound. The two are fundamentally different. Someone may refute this by saying, "For example, if a lecturer orally says 'county magistrate,' the scribe can write 'county head,' or if he orally says 'county head,' he can also write 'county magistrate.' Therefore, 'ling' and 'zhang' can be borrowed from each other, and it is not necessary to change it to 'ling liang.'" I say that this theory is not correct. All borrowing must be done with words that are bisyllabic, near in sound, or homophonous. Therefore, it is said that "rely on sound to represent things." "Ling" and "zhang" are not bisyllabic, near in sound, or homophonous. This is one reason why they cannot be borrowed. Examining the "Table of Officials" in the "Book of Han," counties with more than ten thousand households had magistrates, and those with less than ten thousand households had heads. According to the "Continuation of the Book of Han," each large county had one magistrate with a salary of one thousand dan of grain, and the second had a head with a salary of four hundred dan, and the small had a head with a salary of three hundred dan. The difference in the number of dan between magistrates and heads is vast. This is the second reason why they cannot be borrowed. Only "ling" and "liang," as explained in the annotations to the "Book of Poetry," both mean "good." "Ling" and "liang" are bisyllabic, so they can be borrowed from each other, such as "liang qi" which can be written as "ling qi," as in the poem "A good wife, a long-lived mother." "Liang ren" can be written as "ling ren," as in the poem "I have no good man." By attributing extension to semantic association and using similar sounds to represent things to borrowing, the boundaries between semantic association and borrowing will be clearly drawn, and the true meaning will emerge. Scholars who know this can distinguish the entanglements of ancient and modern people's theories on the Six Methods.</p>
<p>The difficulty of borrowing has been resolved, and the erroneous characters in Xu's preface have been corrected. Then, I began the work of editing. This book mostly adopts existing books and notes the sources to facilitate scholars' examination. Also, the layout of this book is modeled after the "Shuowen Gu Lin," because the characters are small and upright, which is convenient for students to use. If the characters are large and upright, it is not suitable. Abandoning this and taking that is my humble intention, which I hope will be deeply understood by scholars. From the beginning to the printing, it took seven months to complete. I do not dare to say that I have pioneered new paths or built new walls, but I am deeply ashamed of the delay in carving on wood and writing on paper.</p>

<p>(Nanchang Correspondence) Jiangxi Province's graduating senior and junior high school students held graduation examinations in June. However, the middle schools still have spring semester classes. The Department of Education believes that the winter vacation is approaching, so examinations should still be held. All examination matters should also be planned in advance. According to the previous examination method, the examination date will still be held in Nanchang. The senior high school examination will be held from January 24th to 27th of next year, for a total of four days. The junior high school examination will be held from the 24th to the 26th, for a total of three days. Yesterday, schools with spring semester classes graduating this semester, such as Provincial Linchuan Middle School and Private Hongsheng, Jiansheng, Kuanglu, and Yuting, were instructed to prepare a roster with the names, resumes, and grades of the students taking the examination and submit it for approval. At that time, personnel will be sent to lead the students to Nanchang to take the examination.</p>
<h3 id="e212">Recent News on the Collection and Remittance of Education Fees in Various Counties of Jiangsu Province <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>The busy land tax collection in various counties of Jiangsu Province has now been uniformly changed to land price tax. Some counties have merged the busy land tax (renamed land price tax) and divided it into two phases. In addition to remitting the collected funds to the Department of Finance, the educational portion of the fees should also be remitted to the Jiangsu Education Fee Management Office. This kind of two-phase land price tax collection has some counties collecting 40% in the first phase and 60% in the second phase, while others collect 30% in the first phase and 70% in the second phase. There is also the so-called "3-3-4 system," which is divided into three phases: 30% in the first phase, 30% in the second phase, and 40% in the third phase (the former 30% in the first phase and 70% in the second phase is to merge the second phase's 30% and the third phase's 40% into one collection, which is different from the 3-3-4 system, which is collected in three phases and one in two phases). It is heard that the Department of Finance has ordered various counties to collect in two phases (40% in the first phase and 60% in the second phase) to unify the system. Various counties will have a unified approach. This busy land tax (now changed to land price tax) busy silver is collected at 1.75 yuan per tael (the education fee is 0.47 yuan). Paddy rice is collected at 2.40 yuan per shi (there are a total of 1.55 million shi in the province) by the Department of Finance and 1.60 yuan by the education fee, totaling (the so-called land tax) over two million yuan of education fees annually. The Education Fee Management Office is worried that various counties will divert funds. In addition to areas with inconvenient transportation or where the number of education fees is too small to conveniently send a special commissioner to manage the allocation in the county, most of the counties in Jiangnan and the larger counties in Jiangbei have separately allocated education fees and deposited them in the treasury, with special commissioners in charge. Currently, there are more than 30 counties that have been allocated. The performance of these allocated counties in collecting and remitting educational special funds is relatively good, and many unallocated counties are also doing their best to collect and remit education fees. It is also heard that Jiangning Experimental County has increased its tax revenue several times since handling land reporting and clearing up long-standing abuses. The number of education fees has therefore increased unprecedentedly, but the county government has already stored these education fees separately and has not yet remitted them to the Education Fee Management Office.</p>

<p>(Special Dispatch from Beiping) French novelist de Guérande will leave Beiping for Tianjin tomorrow (the 17th) and then travel to Japan. He will return to China in the future for an in-depth tour. The reporter visited Mr. de at the Beijing Hotel today (the 16th) and was received. Here are the key points of his conversation: Before leaving Beiping, I would like to talk to the reporter. Beiping is like a large park, enough to evoke my memories of Versailles. Versailles is the old capital of France, the place where the king lived. Since the revolution of 1789, the capital has moved. My love for Beiping is like my love for Versailles. Every stone and every house in Beiping can prove that it has been the center of prosperity for thousands of years. After traveling in Japan, I plan to return to China for about four or five months, so that I can travel all over South China and the major ports in the Yangtze River basin, and finally to Yunnan. The second time I go to China, I will first visit Beiping. There are four major cities in the world: New York, Paris, Venice, and Beiping, each with its own unique style. Those with a poetic soul cannot forget the beauty of Beiping. I hope that Beiping will never be destroyed by modern Europeans, and even building tall Western-style buildings is inferior to this natural beauty with poetic flavor. Another sight of Beiping is the hutongs. No one can imagine that there are still such artistic families in the hutongs. After returning to China from Japan and arriving in Shanghai, I hope to visit the local film factories. Therefore, this temporary farewell is not a farewell to China, because I will still return to China. The beauty of China is like the magic of a beautiful woman. If someone rejects this magic, they will definitely regret it ten thousand years later. I plan to write two novels based on my impressions of traveling in China and will begin writing after leaving China.</p>
<h3 id="e214">Ministry of Education Inspector Gu Zhaolin Returns to Beijing After Inspection; Discusses the Educational Situation in Suiyuan, Chahar, and Shanxi <a href="#e214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>Gu Zhaolin, an inspector of the Ministry of Education, inspected education in Suiyuan, Chahar, and Shanxi provinces for a period of 53 days. He has now completed his work and returned to the ministry on the 14th to work. His inspection report is being compiled in detail. Based on his private conversations, the educational situation in these three provinces is briefly described below:</p>
<p>Suiyuan It is reported that Inspector Gu visited Gui Sui (Guihua City and Suiyuan City are about three miles apart) and Baotou. Before the 13th year of the Republic of China, Suiyuan only had one school, the First Middle School. In the 14th year of the Republic of China, during the Northwest Army era, the original Five Ethnicities Academy was changed to Zhongshan Academy, gradually promoting education. Now there are two male normal schools, one female normal school, two middle schools, one Zhongshan Academy, one vocational school, and one private middle school. The general situation of school education: The First Middle School has been established for the longest time, and the school site is sufficient, but the equipment is slightly simple. The First Normal School is not in Guihua City, but in the Palace Lord's Mansion, which is very large and has old-style palace houses, and new buildings have been built recently, but the equipment also feels simple. The Vocational School and Zhongshan Academy are both in Suiyuan City, and the school site is sufficient. The Vocational School has agricultural vocational subjects and the equipment is insufficient, so the equipment of scientific instruments and specimens in various schools in Suiyuan is insufficient, which is a common shortcoming. In terms of education, there have been student movements in recent years, and students cannot concentrate on studying, but the students are very honest and hardworking. The school spirit is not good, which is caused by local factions using students. In terms of funding, the province's education expenditure (including social education and elementary schools) is 270,000 yuan, with secondary education accounting for 180,000 yuan. There is also an education fund, which is a 20% surcharge on special taxes, with 70,000 yuan per year used as temporary expenses, so various schools are still able to engage in construction and equipment. The education fee has a partial independence, and the financial authorities are willing to designate several types of funds for the complete independence, but the education sector is afraid to accept it because there is no fixed and guaranteed source of funds in Suiyuan. Therefore, it is difficult for education fees to be completely independent for a while. The subsequent plan has been discussed by the inspector of the Ministry of Education and the educational administrative authorities of Suiyuan, and it has been generally agreed to change Zhongshan Academy into a vocational school and expand the original vocational school. It is estimated that by the 26th year of the Republic of China, the vocational school's funding will reach the standard of 35% of secondary education funding. The reorganization plan of the vocational school has not yet been determined, but it generally tends to focus on the local specialties and needs, such as wool weaving and livestock improvement.</p>
<p>Chahar It is reported that Inspector Gu inspected Zhangjiakou and Xuanhua. Chahar Province originally had one agricultural college, but this year it stopped recruiting college students (because the school's facilities are not sufficient to recruit college students) and instead recruited common middle school students. There are two normal schools and two female normal schools, as well as two middle schools, one vocational school, and one private middle school. The general situation is that the normal school has the most funding, and the vocational school has the least. According to the current financial situation, it is not easy for funding to be independent. Xuanhua School is very large in scale and has impressive equipment. The school buildings in Zhangjiakou, except for the agricultural college built by Feng Huanzhang in Xin Village with a subsidy of 10,000 yuan from the provincial government, are all rented from private houses, which are mostly not applicable. The general equipment of various schools is acceptable, but the scientific instrument equipment is lacking. The subsequent plan is to convert the original college into a vocational school, merge the original two normal schools into one, and keep one of the original two female normal schools and convert the other into a female middle school. There will be slight changes in the middle school. The implementation of this plan is estimated to reach the standard of 40% of secondary school funding by the 26th year of the Republic of China.</p>
<p>Shanxi Inspector Gu inspected Datong, Daixian, Taiyuan, and Changzhi (the former capital of Lu'an Prefecture). The province has colleges above the specialty, including Shanxi University with three colleges of arts, law, and engineering, which has a long history. There are also two provincial law colleges and education colleges. Specialty schools include three specialty schools for agriculture, industry, and commerce. The private Binzhou University has not yet been registered. There is also the private Chuan Zhi Medical College, founded by Yan Xishan. Shanxi University has three colleges of arts, law, and engineering, and there are two provincial law colleges and education colleges, with overlapping departments. The last time Inspector Dai of the Ministry of Education inspected the results, the Ministry of Education ordered the two provincial law and education colleges to be merged into Shanxi University, but this has not yet been implemented. The biggest two reasons are (1) the department order arrived when the examination was being held, and (2) the funding standards are different. After the merger, the provincial treasury must add funding (Shanxi University's education fee is 16 yuan per point, and the law and education colleges are 12 yuan per point. After the merger, it must be 16 yuan uniformly). Many of the province's vocational schools have affiliated high schools. There are many private high schools in Taiyuan City, which can be said that Shanxi's high schools are concentrated in Taiyuan. Because of this situation, students graduating from junior high school can only enter high school except for normal school, and high school graduates must enter colleges above the specialty. Because there are more places for humanities and science departments in provincial and private schools, they can only enter the humanities and science departments. After graduation, because of what they have learned, they are mostly engaged in humanities and science matters. There are more than 1,500 university students in public and private universities, with 300 to 400 graduates each year, and it is already difficult to find a way out. There is one national normal school, five provincial schools, and five provincial female normal schools. Normal school education fees account for 57% of secondary school education, and Shanxi is the province with the most popular compulsory education. There are a population of 300,000 in Taiyuan City, and only 1,000 children are out of school, but according to the current situation, the training of teachers already exceeds the demand. Originally, there were no high schools in various places outside the province, whether provincial or county, only junior high schools. This year, three high school classes were newly recruited in Datong, Yuncheng, and Ningwuguan, so people seeking high school education in various places have equal opportunities, but there are still many private high schools in Taiyuan Province, so there are quite a lot of students. The province's education fees are more than 1.9 million yuan, and are currently issued at 80% of the discount and have not yet been independent. Originally, there were three agricultural vocational schools. This year, a new livestock vocational school and a salt affairs vocational school were established. The funding for these five secondary vocational schools accounts for only 3% of the funding, and efforts will be made to promote them in the future. The overall education plan for the province has been agreed upon in principle by the provincial administrative authorities and the inspector of the ministry, and will be announced after being approved by the ministry.</p>
<h3 id="e215">Second Jiangsu Province Normal Education District Education Improvement Association Holds 3rd Congress in Wujiang <a href="#e215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>(Suzhou Dispatch) The Second Jiangsu Province Normal Education District Education Improvement Association held its third congress on the 16th in Wujiang. Over fifty representatives from education bureaus and member schools of the ten counties of Wuxian, Wujiang, Changshu, Wujin, Yixing, Jingjiang, Liyang, Jiangyin, Wuxi, and Jintan attended. The exhibition focused on educational administration achievements, and the research scope was labor education. Automobiles on the Su-Jia Road chartered a special car to transport members. Local elementary schools in this county also sent achievement products to participate. It was truly a grand event.</p>
<p>The achievement exhibition began at 8:30 AM. Five exhibition venues were opened simultaneously: (1) Wujiang Rural Normal School - First venue, displaying exhibits from member schools. The Suzhou Central Normal Department had no exhibits. The Luoshe Rural Normal School's charts and diagrams were novel. (2) Executive Committee, and recommended the Huangdu Rural Normal School and others to sort out the proposals. In the afternoon, at the second venue, the Rural Normal School Affiliated Elementary School, exhibits from member schools were displayed. Jiangyin Rural Normal School, Jingjiang Rural Normal School, and Jingjiang Rural Normal School Affiliated Elementary School had no exhibits. (3) Wujiang Middle School - Third venue, displaying exhibits from county education bureaus and local elementary schools. Wujin County had no achievements. Wuxi Education Bureau had dozens of items. Changshu Education Bureau and Shishi and Shimei Elementary Schools had approximately two hundred items. (4) Chengzhong Elementary School served as the fourth venue, displaying exhibits from local elementary schools, with Wujiang having the most. Jintan only had sixteen items. Liyang, Jingjiang, Jiangyin, and Yixing each had empty rooms. (5) Chengxi Elementary School displayed Wuxian's achievements, occupying seven rooms two thirds full, with a total of over seven thousand items, making it the most notable location for representatives from various counties.</p>
<p>The opening ceremony was at 9:00 AM. The congress held the opening ceremony in the Dacheng Hall of Wujiang. The ceremony was performed as usual. Standing Committee member Shen Peixian reported that the political situation had changed repeatedly in recent years, but the theory of labor education had not changed. On the contrary, its importance had increased. Since American scholars advocated for it after the May Fourth Movement, countries such as Soviet Russia and Slavic countries have adapted successively, achieving good results. It is necessary to implement labor education for the sake of both private morality and saving expenses. The scope of discussion at this congress is based on this. Then Zhang Beihu reported on the preparations, saying that holding the congress in Wujiang was truly embarrassing, because Wujiang City is not even as good as a rural village. In terms of food, lodging, and transportation, the hotel could not simultaneously provide meals for more than twenty people. The entire city's inns only had about twenty beds. There were also few bus routes. Therefore, a preparatory meeting was reopened on the 13th to remedy the situation. Furthermore, the originally designated two school buildings for the achievement exhibition suddenly received a telegram from Wuxian requesting four more rooms. At that time, there was great panic, because one county required four rooms, and ten counties would need four rooms each. Unfortunately, all the elementary and middle schools in the city only had over twenty classrooms, which was truly difficult. Now, fortunately, things were barely managed. The preparatory committee expressed its deep apologies to all members.</p>
<p>Celebrity Speech: The congress appointed Xishi, Wujiang Education Bureau, and Wujiang Rural Normal School as the presidium. Then celebrity Tao Xingzhi was invited to give a speech titled "A Lecture on Labor Education." After the speech, eleven local groups in Wujiang held a public banquet for all members in the Minglun Hall.</p>
<p>Key Resolutions: At 2:00 PM, the Education Improvement Association held a research conference. The presidium, Shen Peixian, Zhang Beihu, and Jin Shuqiao, reported that today's discussion on the scope of labor education is limited to elementary schools. The discussion included: (1) Changshu Education Bureau's proposal to abolish labor as a separate subject and implement laborization in all subjects was resolved to be retained. (2) Wujiang Rural Normal School's proposal to develop elementary school labor subject teaching materials: (1) Urban elementary schools should focus on simple industry.

(9) Wujin Women's Normal School and Wujiang Rural Normal School's proposal on how labor education should be implemented in schools without agricultural or industrial fields was resolved: Schools should use the nearby environment to remedy the situation. The meeting adjourned at 6:00 PM and was scheduled to continue the next day.</p>

<h3 id="e226">Jiaotong University Student Assaults Referee: Shen Huichun Suffers Serious Injuries to Left Ear and Waist; Hearing Loss Feared Due to Excessive Bleeding in Left Ear; Shen Reports Facts to Referee Association, Seeks Intervention <a href="#e226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>On Saturday, during the Jiangda Football Match between Jinan University and Jiaotong University at Jiaotong University, an incident occurred where a Jiaotong University student assaulted referee Shen Huichun. Details were reported yesterday. The sports community is extremely indignant about this matter, particularly dissatisfied with Jiaotong University's sports director, Shen Guoquan, and the team members' inaction, failing to fulfill their duty to protect the referee. The following is a compilation of expressions from various parties yesterday and details of Mr. Shen's injuries.</p>
<h3 id="e227">Mr. Shen's General Condition <a href="#e227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>According to Mr. Shen, he was immediately assaulted and injured on the field. After the crowd dispersed, he drove himself to Tongren Hospital for treatment. Due to the severity of his injuries, he stayed at the hospital that night. His left ear was severely injured with significant blood loss. Doctors said he might lose his hearing. His right waist was also seriously injured, causing extraordinary pain. He received immediate medication and bandaging. This morning, he followed the doctor's advice to leave the hospital for light movement to facilitate blood circulation and prevent stagnation. However, due to the inability to exert strength in his waist, walking was particularly inconvenient.</p>
<h3 id="e228">Subjected to Cold Remarks and Sarcasm <a href="#e228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Shen also said that when he was beaten to the ground, if Chen Bingde had not dragged him up and Jinan University's goalkeeper, Ye Peichu, and Mr. Tu Kaiyuan had not protected him and taken him to the gymnasium, his life would have been in danger. However, after arriving at the gymnasium, he was subjected to cold remarks and sarcasm from the Jiaotong University team staff. When leaving the school gate, Jiaotong University's sports director, Shen Guoquan, not only did not express any apology but questioned, "This penalty kick should not have been called." He stated, "Whether this penalty should have been awarded is something I don't need to argue. Those who are discerning will understand. For Mr. Shen, as the director of sports at a university, to say such a thing speaks volumes about his moral character."</p>
<h3 id="e229">Negotiation by Referee Association <a href="#e229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Shen further stated that this morning (i.e., yesterday), Shen Guoquan, after seeing the harsh criticism of Jiaotong University in the newspapers, realized he was in the wrong. He went to the Sports Advancement Association to inquire about Mr. Shen's address and then visited his home, seemingly wanting to reconcile. Mr. Shen told Mr. Shen Guoquan that since he had hired the referee through the Sports Referee Association, not directly, and that Mr. Shen's refereeing was based on the Referee Association's appointment, he and Mr. Shen Guoquan could not negotiate directly. Mr. Shen could only report the facts to the Referee Association and let them resolve the matter. However, he was very grateful for Mr. Shen Guoquan's visit and concern.</p>
<h3 id="e230">Mr. Zhou Jiaqi's Remarks <a href="#e230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Zhou Jiaqi, an official of the National Sports Advancement Association, is also an alumnus of Jiaotong University and has been a sports instructor at Jiaotong University for many years. He has always valued the spirit of sportsmanship. Mr. Zhou was also at the stadium that day. According to Mr. Zhou, Shen Guanlan's collision with Xu Yahui should have been penalized. Near the end of the second half, Jiaotong University students already displayed inappropriate behavior, seemingly indicating a willingness to resort to violence. Shen Guoquan, standing nearby, smiled knowingly. As expected, after the match, Mr. Shen was beaten. However, Shen Guoquan and the Jiaotong University players did not step forward to help, which was truly inappropriate. Mr. Shen Guoquan should have escorted Mr. Shen into the gymnasium after the match. If he had, the students would not have dared to cause trouble. Mr. Shen Guoquan's failure to do so only encouraged the students to be even more reckless.</p>
<h3 id="e231">Mr. Yu Hengzhi's Remarks <a href="#e231" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c231" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">231</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Yu Hengzhi, the director of sports at Jinan University, stated that he, having seen repeated disputes in university football matches, tried hard that day to prevent the players from playing roughly. However, the Jiaotong University players made many illegal collisions that day. When Xu Yahui was hurt by an opponent's collision, he protested to the referee, who sternly reprimanded him, saying, "Don't say too much, or you will be penalized and sent off." (According to referee Shen yesterday, he did say this). At one point, he was extremely indignant about the opponent's actions and truly wanted to instruct his school's players to retaliate in the same way. However, he knew that this was not proper behavior and would only lead to accidents. Therefore, he consistently forbade the players from being rough. During the halftime break, Xu Yahui expressed his feelings to Mr. Yu, who sternly reprimanded him, saying that he must continue to play as usual and not say too much. He felt that it was extremely unfortunate that referee Shen was beaten afterward.</p>
<h3 id="e232">Chen Bingde Also Injured <a href="#e232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Chen Bingde, the director of sports at Fudan University, was also present and was the first to help Mr. Shen. According to Mr. Chen, after Mr. Shen was beaten to the ground, he immediately picked Mr. Shen up and, with the help of two others (Jinan University's goalkeeper Ye Peichu and Mr. Tu Kaiyuan), protected him into the stadium. However, as a result, Mr. Chen's back was also injured by Jiaotong University students, and he still feels the pain. When the crowd was attacking, in order to rescue Mr. Shen, Mr. Chen used a leather case for a camera lens (which resembled a pistol holster) as if it were a gun and sternly ordered the crowd to disperse. In reality, Mr. Chen did not have a gun and successfully tricked the crowd. This was truly an interesting anecdote from that day's chaos.</p>

<p>Yesterday, Donghua defeated Lux with a score of 5 to 1 in the Western Union Group A League. Both sides had elite and skilled players, making it difficult to predict the outcome. When Donghua and Lux were tied 1 to 1, Lux's center, Simmons, was injured and had to leave the field, leaving Lux to play with ten players until the end. Donghua's victory was certain even before the end of the game.</p>
<h3 id="e235">Donghua's Chen Line Incomplete <a href="#e235" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c235" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">235</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, Donghua's front, middle, and rear lines were all fragmented. Wang Changying replaced Xun An, and Chen Hongguang moved into the middle line, with forward Li Rongan replacing Cao Qiuting. Although the changes were subtle, they had a significant impact, as the team's strength relies on organization and cooperation. If Lux had not suffered a major injury, Donghua would have had a chance to win, but it would not have been so easy. Among Donghua's five goals, Li Yichen's first goal was the most refreshing, and Dai Linjing's header showed great skill. In terms of merit, the center and the two wings contributed greatly. Li Yichen's sharp shooting and slow movement were both strengths and weaknesses; otherwise, he could be considered a complete player. Zhou Xianyan, Li Ning, and Wu Youliang showed clear skill in maintaining the situation, and their contribution was equal to those who scored goals.</p>

<p>Lux has a long history and is known in Shanghai for its combination of skill and toughness. Although it has declined somewhat, it is still a top-tier team. When it first met Donghua on the field, its fast horses charged out, causing unease on the border. Although the gate was first breached, its spirit turned into excitement. Through hard work, it tied the game. But misfortune suddenly struck when its general was injured. From then on, it was unable to survive and was at the mercy of its opponent. Veteran Alger showed no less prowess than in his prime, and center Hapek was good at running and shooting. The left and right flanks were good at supporting, and Donghua was in danger of being disrupted if it was not careful. Center Simmons took care of both the front and the back, and was the backbone of the team. His injury immediately dashed all hope. The inner defense line was not as strong as the center defense line, so Donghua immediately saw tension when it attacked the city. The goalkeeper did his best, and the five goals lost were not his fault alone.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the battle, Lux's five forwards launched attacks from all directions, and Donghua declared martial law and temporarily took a defensive position. After five minutes, the ball began to leave Donghua and move towards Lux. Jia Youliang took advantage of the opportunity to kick the ball, and Li Yichen stepped aside. Wan Xianghua shot at the goal, and the ball seemed to roll into the goal line but was saved. Unfortunately, the referee did not see it clearly and could not determine the result. Suddenly, Chen Hongguang provided support in the middle. Li Yichen, standing in the crowd, spotted the target and shot the ball, hitting the bullseye. The entire stadium cheered.</p>
<h3 id="e238">Center Ties the Game <a href="#e238" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c238" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">238</a></h3>
<p>After Lux lost a goal, its spirit did not wane, and its forwards continued to attack. First, they probed the center, then turned to the left. Alger kicked the ball, and it fell in front of the goal. Three forwards advanced at the same time. Zhou Xianyan was very alert and jumped up to hit the ball out. Dai and Li ran and passed the ball. With the goal close, Dai did not miss and poured all his hopes into it, but it was lost. Lux became active again, first moving to the left flank, then passing to the right, and then returning the ball to the center. Hapek shot out like a bird and entered the net, making it 1 to 1.</p>
<h3 id="e239">Linjing Uses His Head Instead of His Feet <a href="#e239" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c239" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">239</a></h3>
<p>After the tie, the situation changed. Dai Linjing gave instructions to Jia, who lived up to his mission and advanced step by step. The final shot was missed into the goalkeeper's hands, and all the effort was wasted. At this time, it was reported that Lux's pillar, Simmons, was suddenly injured and had to leave the field. Li Yichen had been lying in wait for a long time, and suddenly became energetic. He stole a ball and passed it to Wan, who passed it to the center without thinking. Dai Linjing threw his whole body out and used his head instead of his chest to welcome the ball into the net, making it 2 to 1. Afterwards, Tu Kaiyuan provided support appropriately, but Li Yichen did not handle it well and missed the opportunity. The first half ended with Donghua leading 2 to 1.</p>
<h3 id="e240">Three More Goals Scored in the Second Half <a href="#e240" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c240" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">240</a></h3>
<p>At the beginning of the second half, Donghua first issued a general attack order, advancing wave after wave. Soon, the enemy committed a penalty, and Li Qunchen scored a goal, making it 3 to 1. Alger once personally took a shot, but Zhou Xianyan knew this trick and blocked it with one arm. Li Ning and Wu Youliang resisted together, and the ball went out of bounds again. Jia Youliang went straight down the right flank, and Meng responded from afar in the middle. He received the ball and shot towards the goal, but it was saved by the goalkeeper. Li Rongan arrived and gently pushed the ball in, making it 4 to 1. As the game was about to end, Wan made another effort and passed the ball in front of the goal. Li Laochen's shot hit the goalpost and bounced back not far away. Dai Linjing chased after it and added another foot, fulfilling his wish. As a result, Donghua won 5 to 1.</p>

<p>The Little Soccer Competition at the First Municipal Stadium, the final match between the All Blacks and the Mixed Team in the Strong Men's Group, was held yesterday morning, as reported in previous newspapers. Before the time arrived, the spectators outside the stadium were packed like sardines, all drawn by the reputation of the two teams. In view of the previous week's incident of spectators crowding into the stadium and causing the game to be stopped, the association specially requested the Sixth Team of the Shanghai South District Security Corps to send personnel to maintain order. At the sound of the tenth bell, the warriors of the two teams entered the field together. Soon after, the referee, Zhang Zhaogeng, blew the horn to declare the start of the battle. The three forwards of the Mixed Team repeatedly broke into the enemy's formation, but the All Blacks' goalkeeper, Liao Shiming, responded skillfully and did not break the strong wall. After ten minutes, the All Blacks' front army seized the opportunity to attack directly. Right forward Jia Youliang swept the ball across the goal in the chaos, opening the scoring. The Mixed Team was suddenly frustrated and fought bravely to retaliate, but at the critical moment, the All Blacks' Liao Shiming caught the incoming ball and threw it far into the enemy's territory. The three forwards seized the opportunity to launch a joint attack, and Jia Youliang once again displayed his superb skills and scored another goal. During the break, the Mixed Team's right forward, Wang Jingui, was furious and charged in alone, scoring a goal, demonstrating his bravery. However, in a short time, the All Blacks' center, Jia Jiliang, received support from the center back, Wang Boyong, and scored another goal. In the second half, the two sides fought even more fiercely, but neither side made any progress. After a long time, the All Blacks got a free kick opportunity and scored another goal. The Mixed Team saw that the break time was approaching and the situation was deadlocked. One or two players, eager for revenge, displayed violent actions and one person was penalized and sent off, tarnishing the team's reputation. Afterwards, the Mixed Team's morale was scattered, and the All Blacks' fighting power was also reduced due to Jia Youliang's injury. Finally, the All Blacks won 4 to 1 and won the Dayong Cup presented by the Dayong Rubber Company. In terms of the strength of the two teams, the forwards were strong, and the Mixed Team's talent was average, but it lacked coordination. The All Blacks were the opposite. From this comparison, it can be seen that cooperation is important in football matches.</p>

<h3 id="e247">On Children's Family Education <a href="#e247" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c247" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">247</a></h3>
<p>— Shen Yan</p>
<p>For a certain period, my neighbor was a Japanese family. The man was a low-level printing worker. There were only the husband and wife and three small children at home, not even a female servant. After the man went out, the woman cleaned and swept at home, working non-stop every minute. Therefore, her house was truly spotless and very clean. This naturally made me admire her greatly. However, these situations may also be seen in Western families. What is most impressive is the family education of the children. Just two examples are enough to make us Chinese feel ashamed.</p>
<p>The first is teaching children politeness. Every afternoon around three or four o'clock, the Japanese elementary school would dismiss its students. As usual, I could always hear a gentle and loud knock on the door. So I would look out from the window upstairs, and I would always see the woman walk out with a smiling face to open the door. As soon as the door opened, I would see three small heads simultaneously bow down, each making a ninety-degree bow. Then the oldest child would go in front, the second in the middle, and the youngest at the end, walking in order. But they were not stiff or slow, and their attitude was very lively. Seeing such orderly and respectful behavior really made people feel that the Japanese were unattainable!</p>
<p>The second is to instill patriotic ideas into children's small minds as much as possible. One day, it was probably some kind of Tenchōsetsu-like holiday. As usual, the family put on new clothes and hoisted a sun flag on the drying platform. They celebrated at home in the morning, singing the national anthem. In the afternoon, the husband and wife went out to participate in some gathering, and the three small children carried small sun flags to play in the alley. Later, somehow the youngest child accidentally broke a corner of the flag. The two older children saw it and hurried over to scold him. The oldest girl even asked my niece for some paste to repair the small national flag and carefully took it back home. According to what she told my niece, breaking the national flag would result in the most severe punishment from their parents.</p>
<p>From the above two points, it is a matter of course that the Japanese are strong. Their success is largely due to family education. Therefore, I feel that we must do our best to give our children appropriate family education and cannot dump the responsibility of educating children entirely on the shoulders of the teachers in the schools. You must know that if children are not given considerable family education, the result will not only affect the happiness of the family, but it will also be greatly related to the future of the country!</p>
<h3 id="e248">Servants <a href="#e248" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c248" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">248</a></h3>
<p>— Fu Yizhi</p>
<p>Servants seem to be a kind of easy job. They don't need the great strength of burden-bearing laborers, nor do they need the skills of operating machines. In particular, they don't need to hold an abacus, calculate profits and losses, or dip a brush in ink and stretch paper to write some "policy essays." They just need to understand the master's personality, know the master's likes and dislikes, serve diligently, and obey orders. If the master is in danger, they need to show a brave, desperate, and protective demeanor within the possible range. This is enough to qualify as a servant. Maybe after the master trusts them, they can have the hope of being promoted to another level.</p>
<p>However, this refers to the former family members, book boys, and the current so-called attendants, errand boys, and other personal servants. If they are serving in a group, it is not so simple and easy. For example, a tea server in a school or a company: the president, dean, and department heads of a university are often contemporary "celebrities" and naturally have their own personal errand boys. The presidents or general managers of well-capitalized companies are a kind of person standing at the highest level of society. In particular, there are very</p>

<p>— Written by Qian Yun and Drawn by Wen Dongliang</p>
<p>Many married friends call the unmarried people children. Actually, what use is it to marry a wife? Women in the city just have to curl their hair and redden their lips to smile at you. They are very willing for their husbands to be like their pet dogs. If you are happy, you might as well hold them down and spank their little butts. They will automatically come to kiss you. It is said that modern couples play this kind of trick, and people will say they are fashionable.</p>
<p>High or extremely clever private servants. We can ignore them. If in ordinary schools and ordinary companies, there are only tea rooms for public use. Every teacher has the right to order this tea server around. No matter how obedient, hardworking, and not lazy he is, there will always be places where the supply is insufficient. When Mr. Zhang calls him to go to do something, Mr. Li calls him but he doesn't respond, which is a bit unpleasant. Conversely, Mr. Zhang will also blame him. I think there is nothing more thankless than this in the world.</p>
<p>But, if you are experienced and worldly, and also clever, you can be competent and happy. That all depends on your ability to measure the power of the teachers. Even something as small as arranging dishes for a meal must be done according to this standard. For example, if there are the president, the dean of academic affairs, the dean of student affairs, and other directors and teachers at the table, or the general manager, manager, sales director, accountant, and other small employees in a company, then the most expensive and palatable dish, "Winter Mushrooms and Half-Singing," should be placed on the side of the president's or general manager's seat. The second most expensive should be placed on the side of the next most powerful person. Inferior dishes may be placed in front of the "inferior" teachers or small employees. If you are called to do something at the same time, do it according to this standard. If the callers are teachers with equal power, then you must weigh the urgency. If the caller has no power, you may make excuses about being too busy, anyway, they can't do anything to you.</p>
<p>This secret was recently observed from the actions of a person with more than ten years of tea server history. However, by referring to other sources, it was discovered that this secret has a wide range of applications. There are many people who have gained both fame and fortune by possessing it. It is not only servants who do this. I have to attribute it to my own backwardness!</p>

<p>— Yu Youqing</p>
<p>In the past few days, on the streets of Suzhou, several large hotels have been decorated with lanterns and streamers, used as wedding halls. There are modern-style weddings, and there are also brides who cover their faces with red scarves, not diminishing the ceremonies of the Qing Dynasty. Whether new-style or old-style, holding a wedding in the Western wind feels somewhat sweet and profoundly interesting.</p>
<p>Who says marriage is the tomb of love? Seeing pairs of happy couples, they are not all people in tombs! Originally, on cold nights where the water is cool and the lonely quilt is not warm, having two people sleep together in the same bed reduces some of the cold. Especially the newly married couple, it's very flavorful. Therefore, in the small spring weather of the abolished calendar, hotels are borrowed as wedding halls, perhaps because of the climate, which makes people have to pair up single men and women.</p>
<p>Old-fashioned marriage brings together a pair of men and women who don't know each other, and they bow to each other in public. Their future destiny is truly in the unknown. However, old-fashioned marriage still holds some viewpoints under the control of old etiquette. It is said that if you marry a chicken, you follow the chicken; if you marry a dog, you follow the dog. For everything in the future, they mostly endure each other. If we talk about modern-style marriage, I am somewhat afraid, because if the man has no wealth and the woman has no beauty, I'm sorry, it won't take long for problems to arise. They see marriage as a play, and they separate and go their separate ways.</p>
<p>I saw the electric candles shining brightly and the wedding hustle and bustle in the hotel, but when I turned around, I saw on the counter of a paper shop, on the cover of the XX Daily, an announcement by lawyer XXX representing XXX's divorce from Ms. XX. I couldn't help but shudder. Marriage really seems like a play.</p>

<p>Gui Zhi laughed, covering her mouth, upon hearing this. Madam Jiang found a box of matches and handed it to Elder Zhao. He took the matches, struck one, and lifted it, then remembered he had his own pack of cigarettes. Speaking, he felt something extra in his hand and seemed to want to put it back in his pocket. So, he returned the matches to Madam Jiang and pulled out his cigarette case from his chest. But as he pulled out the case, he recalled he had already given back the matches. For a moment, he was confused, not knowing what to do with his hands and feet. He laughed and said, "What's wrong with me? I have cigarettes but no fire, fire but no cigarettes, ha ha!" Madam Jiang chuckled, "Old gentleman, you truly love your children. Hearing that Zi Qiang is getting married, you've been joyful day and night, unable to close your mouth." Elder Zhao replied, "Isn't that how it is? I've been happy since yesterday." Madam Jiang said, "From now until the wedding, there are probably still some days. If you're this happy, it'll be terrible." Elder Zhao chuckled, "Haven't you heard? Joy is beneficial to health, and more joy can prolong life! Besides, I'll only be laughing these few days. After these days, once Zi Qiang's letter arrives, I'll be busy. There won't be time for joy." As he said this, he held a cigarette, tapping it against the case. Madam Jiang placed the box of matches in his hand again, laughing, "Light your cigarette and smoke it, or you'll put it away again." Only then did Elder Zhao strike a match, light his cigarette, and sit down to chat with Madam Jiang, saying that he had sent letters everywhere and would slowly prepare everything. "You also need to take care of anything you need to do on your side." Madam Jiang said, "What do I have to take care of? Unless I get the money the old gentleman is contributing and make a few new clothes for Gui Zhi." Elder Zhao said, "That's right, you need to take care of that too. Tailors always delay." (270)</p>

<p>Washing Gloves</p>
<p>As the weather gets colder, gloves are a necessity for warmth. It's worth knowing various facts about gloves. Here are some simple and effective methods to make gloves last longer. Why not give them a try?</p>
<p>To wash exquisite white kid gloves, first put the gloves on your hands. Then, use a small piece of flannel dipped in hot flour and rub it vigorously. Pay special attention to the thumbs and between the fingers. After rubbing vigorously for a while, use a good, stiff brush to brush away the flour particles. The gloves will be like new without any damage.</p>
<p>For soiled colored gloves and white sheepskin gloves, there is a simple way to make them like new. Place them in a wide-necked bottle filled with plenty of gasoline. After putting the gloves in, seal the bottle with a stopper and gently shake it once. After shaking, let it sit for several hours, then take them out, wipe the gloves with a dry cloth, and place them in a cool place to let the gasoline evaporate completely. Soiled gloves, after this washing, can be refreshed. Moreover, this bottle of gasoline can be used repeatedly without needing to be replaced after each wash, which is very economical.</p>
<p>The best way to wash brown sheepskin gloves is to use hot milk with a little shredded soap or soap powder dissolved in it. First, lay the gloves flat on a thick towel. Then, use a small piece of flannel dipped in hot milk with dissolved soap to wipe them. Finally, straighten the fingers of the gloves, flatten the palms, and hang them in a ventilated place to dry.</p>
<p>To wash black sheepskin gloves, use a solution of equal parts good black shoe polish and pure olive oil mixed together. The best way to wash chamois leather gloves is in soapy foam (commonly known as soapy water, usually made by dissolving soap powder). This soapy foam is made with soap flakes or soap powder and a pint (unit of volume) of borax to soften the boiling water. After washing in soapy foam, wash several times in lukewarm water with a few drops of olive oil added. For each wash, change the water until it is clean. This way of washing will prevent chamois leather from hardening.</p>
<p>Washing Clothes</p>
<p>The quickest and most effective way to wash small woolen items or woolen clothes is to put them in a strainer with many small holes at the bottom. This strainer is placed in a container filled with warm soapy foam. First, press the woolen fabric or clothes tightly against the inner walls of the strainer and rub vigorously. Then, wash them several times in lukewarm water. After washing, press them against the inner walls of the strainer, trying to squeeze out as much water as possible. Only then should they be spread out on a flat surface, such as a table or a washboard. Be careful not to stretch or pull them tight when spreading them out. While drying, turn them over from time to time. Before washing colored fabrics, it is best to soak them thoroughly in cold water with plenty of salt added. This way, the colors will not fade during washing. If this precautionary step is not taken, the colors will definitely be damaged. However, if the colors are damaged, they can be restored. Simply use a sponge dipped in a mixture of equal parts household vinegar and cold water to moisten the colored fabrics. To prevent flannel from becoming stiff or felted after washing, simply add a little olive oil to the final rinse water. One tablespoon of olive oil per gallon of water is sufficient. If colored women's silk stockings are soaked overnight in warm soapy foam with a few drops of turpentine added before washing, they will not fade. One tablespoon of turpentine per quart (unit of volume) of soapy water is enough.</p>
<p>Before ironing or pressing fabrics or clothes, it is best to moisten them. The old method of spraying water with the mouth or sprinkling by hand is not very convenient. Now there are sprinklers made of tinplate or brass on the market. If you want an economical solution, you can use a glass bottle with a cork stopper. Just carve a small groove on one side of the cork to replace sprinkling water with your fingers.</p>

<p>It has been exactly one year since the publication began last year on this day. Over the past year, we have received the support and promotion from both the medical and pharmaceutical communities, for which we are very grateful, especially to the gentlemen who have served as writers. In their busy schedules, whether in severe cold or sultry heat, they have wielded their pens to write, adding much color to this publication. This spirit of hard work encourages us to strive and forge ahead, and we should work even harder.</p>
<p>However, looking back at the state of the medical and pharmaceutical community in our country compared to last year, it is still generally chaotic with no progress; while in foreign countries, such as Japan and the Soviet Union, there are often new discoveries and inventions. What we should feel sad about is that others are already using science to deal with us, while we are still discussing whether science is needed, which truly breaks our hearts!</p>
<p>A year has passed quickly, and I hope there will be some progress next year.</p>
<h3 id="e255">A Few Words on the First Anniversary of This Publication <a href="#e255" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c255" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">255</a></h3>
<p>— Pang Jing Zhou</p>
<p>This publication has been around for fifty-two issues, which is just one year. So, we are publishing a "First Anniversary Special Issue." Jing Zhou has been entrusted by the editor-in-chief to say a few words. And as a fervent supporter of this publication, I cannot but speak!</p>
<p>The purpose of this publication is nothing more than to promote the true meaning of scientific medicine and pharmacy, and to instill common health knowledge. That was already stated by the editor at the time of publication. Now that we have worked for a year according to this purpose, we should think about whether this publication has fulfilled its duty. On this point, I believe it has been proven that this publication can be declared innocent! Why? Because when this publication reached its twentieth to thirtieth issue, Jing Zhou proposed that an advertisement be placed in this publication to solicit readers' opinions and criticisms as much as possible. This advertisement ran for five or six issues, and the result was that no criticism was received, which shows that everything in this publication has been tacitly approved by the public, which is also the fulfillment of this publication's duty.</p>
<p>Secondly, we must estimate the effects achieved by the work of this publication over the past year. On this point, there are completely numerical figures that can be calculated. Most newspaper readers know that Shen Bao has a daily circulation of 150,000 copies. Of course, the circulation of each issue of this publication is also 150,000 copies, because this publication is attached to the main newspaper and is not published in any local supplement! In China today, each newspaper is read by an average of ten people, so each issue's text is instilled into one million brains. Fifty-two issues a year means 52 million impressions into people's eyes. This huge number, written horizontally, actually requires six zeros after the 52. A smart person, after hearing Mei Lanfang's Farewell My Concubine once, will often learn his line, "碧海青天夜夜心" (bì hǎi qīng tiān yè yè xīn - green sea, blue sky, night after night, my heart). Since the audience of this publication is as many as 52 million times, it can be equivalent to Dr. Mei singing for 10,000 days at the Tianchan Stage (which can accommodate about 5,000 people), which is equivalent to singing for twenty-seven and a half years. As I think about it, probably many people can not only recite "green sea, blue sky, night after night, my heart," but also "Su San leaves Hongtong County" and "Wang Baochuan lowers her head and looks with her eyes" will also be fluent. Thus, it can be inferred that the truth of new medicine has been able to penetrate people's minds. If it is also like today's Peking Opera, passed from one person to ten, from ten people to a hundred, becoming a common practice, and everyone likes a few lines, then can the progress of Chinese medical affairs not be expected immediately? This is what this publication is very fortunate for.</p>
<p>However, although the positive articles say so, when we think about the reverse side, how can we know that the readers' lack of criticism of this publication is not the indifference of society to medical and pharmaceutical issues? How can we know that the readers do not read the newspaper, first look at the Northeast Peace Talks, and first look at the Fujian Incident, and feel that this publication is not worth a glance? How can we know that the readers do not spend the time reading this publication on watching Farewell My Concubine?</p>
<p>Even if it is really calculated according to the above numbers, then we must also think that the total number of people in the country is 400 million. For 400 million people, listening to the opera only 52 million times a year is equivalent to eight people listening only once a year. Can it be considered universal? We also have to compare this publication with Hollywood's famous movie films. One film is made into hundreds of copies and shown in major cities around the world for several weeks. How many viewers are there?</p>
<p>Alas! Thinking of this, I cannot help but shout, "This publication has not yet succeeded, comrades still need to work hard!"</p>
<h3 id="e256">A Humble Word to the Gentlemen Presiding Over the Beggar Relief Association <a href="#e256" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c256" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">256</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Qi Zhang</p>
<p>On the 25th of last month, Shanghai newspapers reported on the Second Meeting of the Beggar Relief Association, stating that there are approximately 30,000 beggars in this city, requiring an annual expenditure of one million for relief purposes. Truly, they regard the people as if they were wounded, a benevolent intention. I humbly believe that charitable undertakings originate from compassion, and compassion, in turn, is rooted in the shared sympathy of humankind. Only those philanthropists who can truly practice their benevolence must first sympathize with their own families, and then extend that sympathy to others, so that their kindness can benefit all living beings. For those who can truly wear out their heels and save others from hardship are few and far between. In simple terms, if one's own self, family, and clan cannot achieve warmth and sustenance, they certainly cannot spare a thought for the warmth and sustenance of others. Only when one's own self, family, and clan are first free from becoming beggars can they then help others who are beggars. Therefore, charitable undertakings originate from the shared sympathy of humankind, but whether that sympathy can achieve the purpose of permanent relief depends on the methods of relief. According to human abilities, although they differ, self-preservation and the love of life and fear of death are common traits. The descent of a person into beggary, even if it cannot be attributed entirely to the results of poor governance, is largely caused by family and social environment. A small portion may be weak individuals who have failed in their careers, and there may also be those who have fallen into pessimistic behavior due to setbacks in life. However, tracing the fundamental cause, it all stems from ignorance of economics and the inability to balance production and consumption on a material level. On this point, we can temporarily average and reorganize for them, but we cannot permanently bear the burden of supporting them. Therefore, relief methods should correct the error of imbalanced production and consumption, and strictly avoid taking on the responsibility of covering their imbalanced production and consumption. Those in the country who call themselves charitable mostly focus on bearing the burden of consumption and neglect planning for production. Therefore, the more relief there is, the more beggars there are; the more relief there is, the more the recipients become lazy. This is the most incomplete aspect of charitable undertakings, what is called sinking deeper and deeper and making a fool of oneself. The reason a person is a person is that they must have the inherent ability to support themselves. From scholars and officials to sedan chair carriers and footmen, unless they are tired, crippled, or ill, they should have the ability to act. Otherwise, they are simply cutting themselves off from food and clothing. However, those both above and below are ill with laziness. If the propertied class is lazy, they lose their property; if the bankrupt class is lazy, they fall into beggary. Moreover, in addition to laziness, is there not also the help or connivance in their begging and theft? In this way, if sympathy flows with such currents, giving money to the beggar will only make the donor and his family unhappy, and it is no different from planting the seeds of begging, theft, and evil. How can this be allowed? Therefore, the gentlemen presiding over the Beggar Relief Association, having shown great compassion and benevolence, and wishing to add to the care of the destitute and helpless poor, must first identify the goals, taking nourishing their livelihood and restoring their labor as the priority, and should absolutely not take on the burden of their consumables as their responsibility. Then, the 30,000 beggars in this city may be gradually reduced, and the annual expenditure of one million yuan may be used to make them self-reliant. Therefore, I propose several points for the gentlemen's reference.</p>
<p>(1) First, investigate how each individual has fallen into beggary and the reasons for it, classify and record them, and prepare them for teaching and observing their character for use.</p>
<p>(2) Divide them into elderly, adult, youth, and young children, and assess their physical strength and abilities, teaching them methods of production. Those who are ill should be treated in hospitals, and those who are disabled should be sent to homes for the disabled for care, demonstrating the idea that those who do not work will not eat.</p>
<p>(3) At the beginning of teaching methods of production, food and clothing should be provided by the government. When the methods are mastered, they should be self-sufficient. The remainder should be saved for them. Once they are successful, their independence should be maintained so they can re-enter society as people, and they should be rewarded regularly.</p>
<p>According to the English name of the association, Shanghai Anti-beggar Committee, it is clear that it is intended to resist and prevent begging, not to support it. Thus, the traditional concept of charity must be changed in order to have a proper appearance.</p>
<h3 id="e257">Ode to the First Anniversary of Shen Bao Medical Weekly <a href="#e257" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c257" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">257</a></h3>
<p>— Song Guo Bin</p>
<p>The establishment of the Shen Bao Medical Weekly has been a year now. To popularize medical knowledge, nothing is more important than publicity, and the method of publicity lies in writing. In recent years, medical publications have been numerous and numerous, but their nature is too specialized, their scope is limited to big ports, the audience is small, and the effect is difficult to be significant. To reach every place and every person, to have a naturally popular effect without forced promotion, it is best to attach it to major newspapers. Shen Bao has a history of sixty years, and its circulation is the highest in the country. It uses its valuable pages to provide us with a bell, awakening the deaf and blind, revealing the meaning in infinity, and having a beginning and an end, going through ten thousand hardships as if it were one. This is praiseworthy, and the ode says:</p>
<p>The duty of the newspaper is the voice of the people. The magnificent pages are set up for the people. Only medicine and pharmaceuticals are related to the lives of the people. Attaching to the tail of the horse makes publicity possible. Although it is only a year, its influence has spread throughout the country. A rooster crows, and the world turns white. Heresies are refuted, and heresies flee. How prosperous, the truth that is marked.</p>
<h3 id="e258">Winter Child Hygiene <a href="#e258" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c258" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">258</a></h3>
<p>— Zhou Jun Chang</p>
<p>The severe cold has arrived, and if we want to maintain the health and happiness of children, we should pay special attention to them. Here are a few points for the reference of those who love their children.</p>
<p>(1) Fresh Air and Sunlight Fresh air and sunlight are necessities for making children strong and healthy. Sunlight that has passed through glass or clothing is of no help. It must be directly exposed to the body to help development and prevent rickets. Therefore, even on cold days, children should still play outdoors in the sunlight and absorb plenty of fresh air. If it is windy or rainy, dress them in warmer clothes and let them play indoors, but all windows must be open.</p>
<p>(2) Winter Clothing Children should wear more clothes in winter, but not too thick, because it can make active children sluggish. Therefore, they can wear less clothing indoors and add light and warm outerwear when going out. Wool outerwear and leggings are most suitable for wearing when playing.</p>
<p>(3) Quarterly Diet There must be plenty of nutritious food every day, but it should be known that children in winter do not need to eat more than in summer. In addition, attention should be paid to having sufficient beverages every day.</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>(4) Bathing Bathing in cold weather is as necessary as in warm weather. If the bathroom is warm, there is no fear of catching a cold. Bathing every day and massaging their bodies can make their skin smooth and increase resistance.</p>
<p>(5) Afternoon Nap Daily afternoon naps are very beneficial to the health of young children. Older children can be replaced with rest. Children who have enough rest can reduce various crying and anger.</p>

<p>— Pang Jing Zhou</p>
<p>(B) Specific Parts</p>
<p>(1) Nervous system</p>
<p>One perception (clear or confused). Two headaches, dizziness. Three sleep. Four tremors. Five delirium (voice changes). Six reflexes (pupil reflexes, etc.). Seven Various disorders on sensory and motor nerves.</p>
<p>(2) Digestive system</p>
<p>One lips, tongue. Two larynx, uvula, tonsils. Three appetite. Four thirst. Five vomiting. Six bowel movements. Seven examine and palpate the abdomen (whether there are scars, depressions, whether there is pain on pressing, whether there are tumors). Eight percussion of the abdomen (whether there is gas, edema, whether there are tumors, nodules). Also percuss whether the liver and spleen are normal. Nine examine gastric juice and stool.</p>
<p>(3) Respiratory system</p>
<p>One chest structure. Two whether breathing is even. Three breathing movements (fast, slow, manner, sufficient, biased to one side, etc.). Four cough, choking, and sputum. Five symptoms obtained by percussion. Six symptoms obtained by auscultation. Seven chest fremitus and bronchial accessory sounds.</p>
<p>(4) Circulatory system</p>
<p>One observation of the heart area. Two observation of major blood vessels. Three palpation of heartbeat. Four palpation of the apex beat. Five percussion of the heart's position and size. Six auscultation of heart sounds. Seven listening to the sounds of the great arteries.</p>
<p>(5) Urine</p>
<p>One voluntary urination or bedwetting, whether there is pain. Two total amount in 24 hours. Three specific gravity. Four color clarity. Five acidity or alkalinity. Six whether there are proteins and sugar. Seven what the precipitate contains.</p>
<p>Looking at the above conditions, if you are just learning to diagnose diseases, in addition to the patient's gender and age, you need to check three parts, thirteen items, and sixty-five detailed items. However, in the medical profession's habit of diagnosing diseases, there is naturally no such trouble. Relying on experience, you can naturally use a simplified method to check the key points to diagnose a disease. However, on the other hand, there are many pains. Even if every item is checked, you may not get a definite diagnosis, and you must continue to examine the stool, urine, cough, discharge, etc. Or look at how his condition progresses. Some people also use an anal mirror, uterine mirror, laryngeal mirror, bladder mirror, and other instruments to examine. Even using X-rays for fluoroscopy. In short, diagnosing a disease can be extremely difficult and extremely complex. It is definitely not as simple as those letters from ordinary people asking for medicine. You can get a proper treatment. Not to mention anything else, just the patient not meeting the doctor, then the "examination" in the diagnostic elements cannot be resolved. Only using a part of the "chief complaint," that is, according to the old doctor's saying, looking, listening, asking, and feeling, only one word of asking is done. Isn't it too far off topic? Therefore, I think that asking for illness and asking for medicine is extremely inappropriate. If you really want to arouse the reader's medical and pharmaceutical interests, there seem to be only three ways to remedy it. (1) Actively abolish the habit of asking for illness and asking for medicine, and instead publish common sense questions and answers about various diseases in the publication, like the style recently published by Mr. Cheng Hanhua in the Shen Bao Medical Weekly. (2) As a passive method, add a prescribed scope to asking for illness and asking for medicine. Only certain minor diseases can solicit doctors' opinions by mail. And the statement in the letter must have at least a draft, arranged with several necessary items. The patient needs to fill it in completely before answering. (3) All question and answer columns on medical and pharmaceutical publications should be changed to consultant columns on health common sense and physiological common sense, but they should no longer use broad medical and pharmaceutical meanings.</p>

<p>Talking about Immunity (Differences Between Young and Old)</p>
<p>We sometimes encounter other people's questions, saying whether the immunity (usually resistance) of young people (from newborns) is the same as that of older people? This issue is also often studied and discussed in serology, and the result can be said that the immunity of young people is weaker than that of older people. In newborns, it can almost be said that there is no immunity, that is, they can hardly resist pathogens that enter the body, and even if they have some resistance, it is very different from that of older people. Therefore, for the blood tests of infants, such as syphilis reactions, it is more appropriate to do them at least six months later. Otherwise, even if there is no toxic reaction, it is not enough to rely on it as a sign of no disease. Recently, some people have still been re-studying this issue (animal experiments), and the results are equal to the above, so I write about it. (Note that the above-mentioned immunity is specifically for automaticity, and the passive serum efficacy is the same in young and old.)</p>
<p>Talking about Friedmann's Tuberculosis Treatment Drug</p>
<p>FriedmimschesTuberculoseMittel</p>
<p>Friedmann's treatment is a kind of seedling slurry made according to immunological theory. Its ingredient is a kind of tuberculosis bacteria obtained from the body of a cold-blooded animal. Its intention is to enable the tuberculosis patients who have been vaccinated to produce a kind of resistance in their body and treat the tuberculosis in their body. Tuberculosis bacteria from cold-blooded animals have almost no toxicity to humans, so according to Friedmann's intention, there is absolutely no danger. His intention is very good, but the treatment results are not as good as his intention. In Europe and the United States, although there are many years of treatment experience, there are very few who praise its efficacy to this day. The reporter knows that it has also been discovered in Shanghai, so I report its recent results to those who are interested in this drug for reference.</p>
<p>Pulmonary tuberculosis expert Stedman treated 20 cases in the past two years. Among them, 50% were aggravated by using this drug, 25% did not change, and 25% were mild patients, so it was impossible to distinguish its effectiveness.</p>
<h3 id="e261">Notes on the Manufacture of Chinese Medicine <a href="#e261" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c261" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">261</a></h3>
<p>— Lin Hongzao</p>
<p>Preface</p>
<p>Our country's use of medicine to treat diseases dates back to ancient times. Shennong's tasting of hundreds of herbs marked the beginning of recorded Chinese medicine. Later generations compiled and wrote about it, and during the Ming Dynasty, Li Shizhen compiled the great compendium of Chinese medicine, the Compendium of Materia Medica. It contains no less than two thousand kinds of medicines, but it is criticized by the world for its theories of color, taste, the five elements, and their association with the internal organs. However, its unique effects are indeed amazing, and it is still praised by the world. Countries around the world are studying it and making every effort to adopt it. For example, ephedra is used as a treatment for asthma, and rhubarb is adopted into legal medicine, making a splash in the world and has long been well known. Furthermore, the production of angelica and coix seed into fine products shines brightly in today's pharmaceutical world. How can it not be said that Chinese medicine possesses these qualities? The inclusion of Chinese medicine in various national pharmacopoeias and other medical books is countless. Our country's lack of scientific progress has led to the shame of being supplanted by others. It is truly disheartening. If we do not quickly catch up and reform, they will take all our Chinese medicine and turn it into foreign medicine. However, Chinese medicine has more than two thousand kinds, and it is not easy to verify the ingredients of each one before using it. Therefore, we must take what they already know and use it as help from others. Examining scientific drugs, although there are many kinds, they can be roughly divided into three types, namely crude drugs, pure drugs, and preparations. Among these three, except for crude drugs that are directly used for their efficacy, pure drugs are ingredients extracted from crude drugs or chemical drugs. Their success is slow, and it is difficult to achieve results without considerable equipment and long-term research. Preparations are made by using crude drugs and their ingredients or chemical drugs, based on their efficacy, and using pharmaceutical science to make extracts, tinctures, and elixirs, to be used as needed for treatment. Although the manufacturing method is cumbersome, it is much more convenient than pure drugs. Moreover, due to its convenient application and durable storage, it occupies a leading position in pharmaceuticals. Why is the adoption of Chinese medicine not the same? The manufacture of rhubarb into tinctures and the refining of licorice into extracts are the most prominent examples. Our country is currently facing national difficulties and financial constraints. Is it possible to refine each Chinese medicine into pure drugs? Even the bark and roots of trees cannot be properly managed, let alone going against the grain. The preparation is easy to manufacture and is in line with the current improvement of Chinese medicine. If it can be refined into preparations based on known efficacy to alleviate urgent needs, it may not be a bad idea to assist Chinese medicine. This is the reason for writing this book. The preparations of Chinese medicine collected in the book are all those that have been adopted by various countries and used as lessons. Foreign medicines that can be replaced by Chinese medicines are also included for reference. As for the research on crude drugs and pure drugs of Chinese medicine, they will be discussed in separate books and are not within the scope of this book. I hope that the people of our country will rise up and conduct research and improvement. This is what the editor hopes. However, there may be omissions and errors, and I hope that scholars will correct them.</p>
<h3 id="e262">General Rules <a href="#e262" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c262" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">262</a></h3>
<p>(1) This book is divided into two sections. The first section is the general theory, discussing the techniques that preparations should have. The second section is the specific discussion, discussing the manufacturing methods of each preparation, with matters related to preparations attached at the end.</p>
<p>(2) The standards for the selection of each preparation in this book are as follows:</p>
<p>1. Those made purely with Chinese medicine,</p>
<p>2. Those that mix Chinese medicine with foreign medicine,</p>
<p>3. Those that can be replaced by Chinese medicine,</p>
<p>A total of three items are not limited to those already included in foreign pharmacopoeias, and those found in various pharmaceutical books are also included.</p>
<p>(3) Before the names of each preparation and the names of the drugs used in this book are finalized, the common names are temporarily translated and the original names are noted under the translated names for reference. Those that have been promulgated in the Chinese Pharmacopoeia shall follow them.</p>
<p>(4) The measurement system used in this book generally follows the convenience of each preparation, and the British and French systems are used in parallel. The system is described in another chapter.</p>
<p>(5) The dosage or extreme dosage of each preparation in this book is for adults. When applied to children or the elderly, it should be reduced according to age. However, if it is necessary to increase it for treatment, the physician shall be responsible for it based on experience and discretion. However, the pharmacist must carefully examine it and be responsible for rechecking it, and may only give it after inquiring with the prescribing physician.</p>
<p>(6) The classification of preparations should be listed according to their shape in pharmaceutical science. However, because the collections in this book are all Chinese medicines, for clarity, each preparation is listed after the corresponding Chinese medicine, with Chinese medicine as the main heading and preparations as the subheadings.

<h3 id="e263">Common Sense Q&amp;A About Diseases <a href="#e263" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c263" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">263</a></h3>
<p>— Cheng Hanzhang</p>
<p>(21) Emphysema and Atelectasis</p>
<p>(Q) What is emphysema?</p>
<p>(A) Emphysema is a state of abnormal expansion of the lungs due to excessive accumulation of air. It means that the lungs themselves are very expanded and have lost their elasticity.</p>
<p>(Q) What is atelectasis?</p>
<p>(A) This is the opposite of emphysema. The air content is very small or even completely absent, so the lungs themselves shrink.</p>
<p>(Q) How does emphysema occur?</p>
<p>(A) Most of them are caused by chronic bronchitis (inhalation of dust and tobacco, people who drink alcohol) and bronchial asthma, as well as repeated strong pressure on the lungs (playing the trumpet, glass blowers). But generally speaking, it seems to be related to physical constitution.</p>
<p>(Q) What are the symptoms of emphysema?</p>
<p>A The patient's chest expands, like a barrel, almost completely taking the posture of inhalation. The sternocleidomastoid muscle and scalene muscle are clearly prominent, the jugular vein is distended, the neck is short, the chest resistance increases, the respiratory movement is weak, and the vital capacity of the lungs is naturally reduced.</p>
<p>(Q) What symptoms can the doctor prove when percussing and auscultating?</p>
<p>(A) When percussing, there is a paper box sound, the lower border of the lung is lowered, and the mobility of the lung edge is reduced during breathing. During auscultation, the alveolar sound is weakened and the expiration is prolonged. There are also dry or wet rales.</p>
<p>(Q) What are the phenomena when taking X-rays?</p>
<p>(A) The lung area is very transparent, the diaphragm is flat, and the right ventricle must be enlarged.</p>
<p>(Q) Are there any changes in the heart?</p>
<p>(A) Yes. When percussing, the cardiac dullness area is reduced (this is because the lungs are covered). When auscultating, the heart sound is weak and the second pulmonic sound is strong.</p>
<p>(Q) What diseases are emphysema patients prone to?</p>
<p>(A) Prone to bronchitis.</p>
<p>(Q) What is the treatment for emphysema?</p>
<p>(A) Patients should avoid various causes, do not inhale dust, and move to a place with a good climate to completely cure chronic bronchitis. The medicine is expectorant such as tincture of ipecac, tincture of senega, ammonium chloride, etc. When there is a cough, you can use narcotic antitussives. When the heart is weak, use cardiotonics such as digitalis. For difficulty in breathing, mustard paste can be applied to the chest, and chest compression can be performed to help breathing.</p>
<p>(Q) What are the causes of atelectasis?</p>
<p>(A) There are congenital and acquired causes. The acquired causes are bronchial occlusion, compression of nearby organs, and weakening of respiratory muscles.</p>
<p>(Q) What are the symptoms of atelectasis?</p>
<p>(A) Acquired ones present with difficulty in breathing, the chest is depressed in an inspiratory shape, and the respiratory sound is weak and bronchial sounds, etc. are heard during auscultation.</p>
<p>(Q) How dangerous is this disease?</p>
<p>(A) Most congenital ones die. Acquired ones are not necessarily related to the cause and the breadth of the affected area.</p>
<p>(Q) What is the treatment for atelectasis?</p>
<p>(A) Pay attention to the cause and change the position. Use stimulants and tonics, and patients should take warm baths and deep breaths every day.</p>

<h3 id="e264">Reading "The Classic of Filial Piety" <a href="#e264" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c264" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">264</a></h3>
<p>— Cao Juren</p>
<p>I saw in the newspaper some time ago that a certain general ordered students to read "The Classic of Filial Piety." Recently, Dong, a resident of Funing, disobeyed his father, wrote a letter demanding money, called himself "Grand Old Man," and directly called his father by his name. The magistrate of Funing County detained Dong and ordered him to recite "The Classic of Filial Piety." This apocryphal book (Confucius's "ambition was in the Spring and Autumn Annals, and his actions were in the Classic of Filial Piety," see the Classic of Filial Piety Weigou Mingjue, which is not credible. Some say that the Classic of Filial Piety came from Zengzi, which is also not credible. Mencius called Zengzi's filial piety "cherishing his ambition," but there is no such statement in the Classic of Filial Piety. Mencius answered Gongduzi's question about Kuang Zhang's lack of filial piety, advocating "fathers and sons should not demand goodness from each other," which is also contrary to the Classic of Filial Piety's advocacy of "therefore, one should argue when there is injustice." This book was probably written by Confucian scholars in the early Han Dynasty and has nothing to do with Confucius, Mencius, or Zengzi. I suspect that the Classic of Filial Piety began with Zhu Xi, and Qing scholar Yao Jiheng has already made a conclusion.) is actually so popular this year. It is really beyond my expectations.</p>
<p>I have been familiar with the Classic of Filial Piety since I was a child, but I don't believe that this book will have any benefit to the world and people's hearts. After the Russo-Japanese War, Japanese elementary school students often formed groups to fight on the way home from school. During the European War, elementary school children often stabbed each other. These are all suggested by the hostility between countries and reflected in their psychology. In recent years, the various unethical phenomena in Chinese society are also a reflection of another kind of social phenomenon after careful examination. Since the late Qing Dynasty, the trend of vying for power has been greatly opened, and both openly and secretly, people are encouraged to lose their integrity and sell themselves. There is no such thing as integrity outside of speculation, and no such thing as morality outside of interests. In such a big upheaval, all ethical relations have been changed. The relationship between teachers and students, friends, brothers, and fathers and sons has naturally become a trading calculated on an abacus. On the other hand, due to the concept of personal enjoyment cultivated in cities, the sense of responsibility to the family has been reduced. Many old men and old ladies live under the eaves of their sons and daughters-in-law's small families, relying on their whims, and are not as good as servants. If it is said that disobedient children should read the Classic of Filial Piety, then there are many owners of modern small families who should read the Classic of Filial Piety today. Is it only Dong who should be detained?</p>
<p>Mr. Xiong Foxi once wrote a play about a foreign champion who called his "father an old comrade" and his "mother an old comrade." This foreign champion is not a fictional character. The foreign champion who returned from abroad feels that foreign ethics are all right and Chinese ethics are all in the way. He would rather be a loyal servant and errand boy for a "flying umbrella" than take responsibility for his old man. He would rather give his seat on the tram to an unfamiliar miss than let his old lady rest for a while. There are people who widely distribute the Treatise on Response of the Great Lord, but to no avail. The result of advising people to read the Classic of Filial Piety is probably the same.</p>
<p>The most important task at present is not to widely read the Classic of Filial Piety, but to encourage integrity and stop encouraging people to lose their integrity and sell themselves. This is the right way!</p>
<h3 id="e265">Sickness <a href="#e265" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c265" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">265</a></h3>
<p>— Jin Yi</p>
<p>That day when I got up in the morning, I felt that my head was heavy, as if it was no longer supported on my shoulders, but was drooping to the ground.</p>
<p>"I'm afraid I'm sick again!"</p>
<p>I sighed like a wisp of smoke.</p>
<p>"Any kind of hardship can be endured, but it's a bit difficult for a single person when they get sick!"</p>
<p>When I recalled what I said a long time ago, I shivered in alarm.</p>
<p>The sickness was obviously crawling on my body. My face was burning red, my jaw was too lazy to open, and I dragged my lazy steps wearily. I said to myself hatefully:</p>
<p>"It's better to die!"</p>
<p>Sitting in the chair, I wondered why I was sick again. So I thought of the unsettled dream last night. But isn't this too empty? Even if I'm not an unfeeling person, if I'm sick just because of the reappearance of a woman who has forgotten me in a dream, isn't it too ridiculous? But my head was dizzy, and I supported it with my hand.</p>
<p>Speaking of illness, I'm not afraid of it. Seeing people groaning in pain, I sincerely wished that I could suffer for that person. I can endure the harm that illness gives me, and so many times, it has not brought the last friend of mankind 丨丨 death.</p>
<p>My red face has always been said to be healthy, but they never thought that this healthy person has such a weak heart. This will be like my good friend, who can accompany me throughout my life. But this loyalty is also quite gratifying. Only under excessive melancholy and anger will it tell me to temporarily leave this world. But it always sends me back, letting me see that I am lying in someone's arms, or crawling up from the floor myself, touching the wounds on my face from falling.</p>
<p>I'm sick, and an irresistible cold comes from my heart. My body is shaking, my teeth are clattering, but I put on a scarf, put on a coat, and went out. I walked slowly, past one red door after another, struggling to walk up the arched bridge. Looking north, I saw the round tower in the North Sea against the blue sky, with its white color, standing there high and lonely. But looking down, floating on the beautiful green water, are all the scorched lotus leaves and lotus stalks!</p>
<p>I walked back as if I had gained something. I really felt that my head was too heavy, so I went back to bed.</p>
<p>All day long I didn't know if I was asleep or awake. Sometimes it seemed like there was a pair of eyes flashing in front of me, but they were gone immediately. I don't know where I am, and I don't know where to go.</p>
<p>Dusk, slid down from the wings of crows. When I opened my eyes and looked at the gradually darkening house, it was already time to turn on the lights, but I couldn't stand up. I turned over sadly, and I couldn't help but shed tears for this feeling of loneliness.</p>
<p>But a friend with the heart of a child came in, and he asked me kindly, putting his hand on my burning forehead.</p>
<p>I sighed deeply.</p>
<p>My illness quietly left after making me endure a day of pain. In this way, I stood up healthily again, writing with a pen or speaking with my mouth: I can be a bachelor, I can live peacefully by myself. But I only hope that illness is my most unfamiliar guest.</p>

<p>— Meng Yuan</p>
<p>(3)</p>
<p>In the "Suzhou-Shanghai Exchange" section of the fifth issue of the second volume of "Literary Tea Party," Mr. Sun Fuxi said that he visited Tianping Mountain in Suzhou. One of the impressions he got in the "painted boat" was:</p>
<p>Most of the sedan chair carriers in Suzhou are women, so they can be called sedan chair women. Their courageous and hardworking spirit is really admirable. However, the petty haggling over prices and asking for money for wine, snacks, and straw sandals (I don't recognize this word, and there is no dictionary to look up, so please forgive me for not noting it! Meng) really lowers this hardworking spirit a lot.</p>
<p>Meng Yuan said: This is "chrysanthemum philosophy." The philosophy that is named "chrysanthemum" means "purity and loftiness." For example, Suzhou women can be "courageous and hardworking." If they tighten their stomachs and don't want money, then wouldn't the impression given to "tourists" be better and more unified? And asking for money, and asking for it endlessly, this naturally makes people change from the "admirable" position to the sigh of "spiritual degradation." After hearing Mr. Sun's words, I don't know if Suzhou women can change their ways and never eat from now on, and never ask for money for carrying sedan chairs from now on?</p>
<h3 id="e267">A Brief Reply to Mr. Xu Maoyong <a href="#e267" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c267" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">267</a></h3>
<p>— Shi Heng</p>
<p>Mr. Maoyong:</p>
<p>Because the editor of "Free Talk" is unwilling to take up space with this issue, it is very difficult to see Mr. X's letter, and it is necessary to briefly reply a sentence or two. Mr. X brought up the divergence between idealism and materialism in art theory, which in my opinion is not the case at all. What I have repeatedly said is to make Mr. X first recognize the truth of art, and then talk about the truth of society or the truth of history. This theoretical step is not based on the different viewpoints of idealism or materialism. Without looking far, G, the author of "The Iron Flood", and Nie La Tuofu, cannot be said to be an idealist in any case, but he cannot completely abandon the truth of art and discuss the historical truth of "The Iron Flood". I think one of the main differences between idealism and materialism is that one only takes the truth of art as the complete purpose, and the other takes the truth of art as a means to achieve the truth of society or history. If so, wouldn't it be wrong for Mr. X to call me an idealist! As for "Shaning", we all agree that it is historically untrue, but I say that its untruth is quite related to its artistic untruth. However, Mr. X initially denied this step, but in this last letter, Mr. X can say: "I have never placed the expression of art in a position secondary to the recognition of reality." Then what is there to argue about?</p>
<p>Mr. X pointed out where I misunderstood, but I still cannot admit it. According to Mr. X's mechanical view of art, although it does not go so far as to identify Don Quixote as a knight and Hamlet as a Danish prince, for the mechanical method used to combine artistic characters with social existence, the result is still an equal fallacy.</p>
<p>If Mr. X still insists that I am an idealist, I hope Mr. X can give me a detailed analysis, and I am also willing to learn and correct myself. But I cannot accept the principle of "social existence" that determines art!</p>
<p>I admit that this issue can now be concluded. If no new issues are raised, I have decided not to answer any more, because I want to save the space of "Free Talk". Please forgive me for not being polite.</p>

<p>— Guy de Maupassant, translated by Li Weikehui</p>
<p>She couldn't help but burst into anger when she heard this. The word turtle was too unpleasant, and she thought it was indirectly mocking her.</p>
<p>"Who are you saying that to?"</p>
<p>"To Zhe'an! It's really funny to see them like that!"</p>
<p>She was so moved that she shuddered slightly and muttered in a low voice:</p>
<p>"Ah, Pierre, how cruel you are! This woman is the embodiment of integrity. Your brother will never find anyone better than her."</p>
<p>He simply burst out laughing, a deliberate, sudden laugh.</p>
<p>"Ha! Ha! Ha! The embodiment of integrity! All women are the embodiment of integrity... and all their husbands are turtles. Ha! Ha! Ha!"</p>
<p>She didn't say a word, stood up, hurriedly ran down the sloping sandy beach, risking slipping and falling into those holes hidden under the grass, breaking her legs or arms, and went straight, almost running, through those muddy roads, towards her other son.</p>
<p>When Zhe'an saw her approaching, he shouted:</p>
<p>"What's wrong? Mom, have you decided to come catch shrimp?"</p>
<p>She didn't answer him, grabbed his arm, as if to say to him: "Save me, protect me!"</p>
<p>He was taken aback when he saw her so flustered;</p>
<p>"Your face is so pale! What's wrong with you?"</p>
<p>She stammered:</p>
<p>"I almost fell, I walked through these reefs with trepidation."</p>
<p>So Zhe'an guided her, helped her, and told her about the methods of catching shrimp, in order to arouse her interest in this matter. But because she didn't pay attention to his words at all, and he felt a strong urge to tell someone his secret, he took her to a farther place and said to her in a low voice:</p>
<p>"Guess what I did?"</p>
<p>"But... but... I don't know."</p>
<p>"Guess."</p>
<p>"I... I don't know."</p>
<p>"Then I'll tell you, I told Mrs. Lu that I wanted to marry her."</p>
<p>She didn't answer anything. Her head was buzzing and she almost didn't understand his words. She repeated:</p>
<p>"Marry her?"</p>
<p>"That's right, did I do well? She's very cute, isn't she?"</p>
<p>"Yes... very cute... you did well."</p>
<p>"Then do you agree?"</p>
<p>"Yes... I agree."</p>
<p>"You look so strange when you say that. Others think... think... you're dissatisfied."</p>
<p>"But I... I'm satisfied."</p>
<p>"Really?"</p>
<p>In order to prove that she was indeed satisfied, she hugged him tightly and kissed him on the face, a heavy kiss from a mother to her child.</p>
<p>After she wiped away the few tears that welled up in her eyes, she saw a person sleeping face down on the beach over there, like a corpse, his face buried in the sand. This was her other son, Pierre, who was thinking hard and despairing.</p>
<p>So she took her little Zhe'an and walked farther away, to a place very close to the waves. They talked for a long time about this marriage, which was her greatest concern.</p>
<p>The rising tide drove them to join the other shrimp catchers, and afterwards everyone returned to shore, waking up Pierre, who was pretending to be asleep. The dinner that day lasted a long time. Everyone drank a lot of wine.</p>

<h3 id="e269">Economic System and Economic Society by Tang Kun <a href="#e269" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c269" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">269</a></h3>
<p>In today's economic society, anyone who wants to understand the Chinese economic situation is relentlessly cursing capitalist economics. They curse capitalism as a demon that sucks human blood. Moreover, the capitalist economy is especially strongly opposed by the Chinese scholar-official class, because China is currently a defeated member under the economic invasion of capitalist countries. The reason for this is China's own lack of vigor and the wrong foundation laid on its own national base. Any production technology in China is inferior to other countries. In the United States, Japan, and England, because of the development of capitalist countries, they spare no national spirit to seek the markets of other countries where capitalism is based (explicitly speaking, it is a position for exploitation); even to the point of conflicting with other countries for interests, causing military confrontation. Observing the war clouds spreading across the Pacific, Japan, the United States, Russia, and England are all sharpening their swords, preparing for another world war for the sake of their own country's capitalist needs. At the same time, the center of the war problem caused by capitalist countries seizing markets will soon be our Far East; and this place is still our China. The reason for this is that China's own production technology is not sophisticated, and the population is large, holding the helm of the world; because of the large population, the social consumption capacity also increases accordingly. Under this phenomenon, capitalist countries with overproduction are most coveted; and become the market that must be occupied for capitalist invasion. At the same time, the corruption of China's internal affairs and the frequency of banditry make all capitalist countries regard it as meat on the chopping board. Because of this, China's curse on capitalism is not absolutely without reason. With this kind of reason for opposition, there has been a tendency towards socialism in the recent Chinese economic circles; but whether China needs a socialist economic system now; or whether this socialist economy can be achieved in China, is a big question. The reason is that China's economic society has never been organized. You cannot say that it is a capitalist economy or society; nor can you say that it is a socialist economic society. China's current economic system and economic society are completely a backward member who cannot keep up with the new economic thinking. In England, the United States, and other countries, they have a large number of factories; from these factories, they can have a large amount of production; regardless of whether this large amount of production is needed or not by the economic society, the conditions that they can create for capitalism cannot be denied. In Soviet Russia, the economic organization is fully trending towards a socialist economic system. It can statistically manage various factories under the jurisdiction of the government. All production and economic relations with the country can be relaxed or tightened under the government's leadership. As for our China? Is it really a joke to say that it is a capitalist country? Not only has it lost the large number of factories needed to invade the economic markets of other countries; its own factories are still very immature, under the dangerous situation of other capitalist countries. At the same time, other capitalist countries are still trying their best to invade our market. In a corner of the Shanghai concession, factories of various countries stand in great numbers, and the outflow of annual rights is unknown how much; then this situation is certainly not a capitalist country; and it cannot be denied that China is now a pitiful worm suffering from the losses of capitalist countries. As for the socialist country? It seems that China does not have a country with a socialist economic organization. Politically, it lacks a strong and powerful government; and the government's ability to lead. Economically, it lacks a large number of factories in the country that can provide for the consumption of those countrymen; then what kind of economic system and economic society is China? This question seems to be a difficult one. Naturally, the capitalist system is impossible in China; and at the same time, it is not possible; and further, even if it could, it would create more unemployed workers and much more chaotic social data than any other country. As for the socialist economic system? There is indeed some trend in the current remarks of Chinese economists; but whether it is possible is a question. Of course, the change of the economic system is not a matter of a day or two; it is useless to simply sing high-profile tunes. To study this question, we only need to ask ourselves when China can implement a socialist economy. Naturally, it is impossible for China to talk about any kind of economic organization now, because China is now a country with backward production technology; at the same time, the internal affairs of the country cannot be unified, bandits are rampant, and the oppression of the great powers, like prisoners wearing fetters, is trapped in a semi-colonial state. If everyone wants to seek the lowest living standard; it is still impossible in fact. The main reason for this is that the creation of an economic organization completely holds a large number of factories; and a large amount of production, as well as the tools to exploit the economic markets of other countries; in China, none of these exist, so if China wants to create a socialist economic organization, the first step is to develop its own production, so that the Chinese people can each be self-sufficient. At the same time, internally, it must not be so scattered, because under the current economic situation in China, the products of this place are often unable to accommodate that place; just imagine that there is such a gap in the country itself, and you want to realize the socialist economic organization just by holding an idea, of course, it is no different from dreaming. However, the economic trend in China cannot conceal that it is trending towards the road of socialism. The statistics of various industries in the country; the inability to improve economic technology, are all showing everywhere that China is gradually moving towards the road of socialism. We do not want to say prophetic words here, we only pray for success for any kind of system at present.</p>
<h3 id="e270">Currency War Among England, America, and France by Zhao Chaogou <a href="#e270" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c270" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">270</a></h3>
<p>The modern economic organization is based on currency, and the fluctuation of currency value is enough to determine the trend of the economic world. The masters of the world's currency are the US dollar, the British pound, and the French franc. Currently, it is an era of melee among these three currencies. The smile or frown of these three currencies is a factor that dominates the economies of various countries; the destination of these three currencies is also the destination of the world economy. Therefore, in order to understand the world economy, we cannot ignore the actions of these three, and through these three, we can also glimpse a side of the world economy.</p>
<p>But although it is said to be a melee of three currencies, we must examine them separately. The first culprit in the war is the US dollar. On the battlefield, it is the active one. If it is willing to be stable, the stability of the pound and the franc is not a problem. Although England belongs to the ranks of suspending the gold standard, it has long hoped for exchange rate stability. The Exchange Equalisation Account is to prevent the pound from rising, but it also prevents the pound from falling too much. However, if the United States actively challenges, it will naturally come out to respond. The most suffering is the franc. France, which is free within the gold standard system, cannot resist by lowering the exchange rate. It has to defend itself with tariffs and other methods. Needless to say, it does not have the ability to counterattack. Whether it can resist the double attack of the United Kingdom and the United States is still a question.</p>
<p>X X X</p>
<p>The goal of the US currency policy is to increase prices. After Roosevelt inflated the currency, it initially had a considerable effect on prices, but after August, a reaction occurred again, and stock prices gradually fell. Then he decided to use a new currency policy, that is, to purchase gold at home and abroad. According to Roosevelt's statement, he wanted to raise prices to a considerable level, and then stabilize the value of the US dollar. To achieve this goal, it is necessary for the government to buy gold and lower the US dollar. According to the US currency law, one ounce of gold is equal to 20.67 yuan. The price at which the government buys gold is above the par value. The gold purchase price on October 25 was 31.36 yuan per ounce, which was 34% higher than the par value.</p>
<p>However, whether purchasing gold to increase prices can achieve the goal is still a question. If you want gold to be expensive to suppress the US dollar price, thereby increasing prices, you must consider two different situations. If the European gold standard group can continue to exist, the decline in exchange rates can indeed stimulate the rise in prices. But if the European gold standard group collapses and abandons the full gold standard system, the US dollar will have the risk of becoming expensive. Judging from the objective situation, if the US insists on its gold purchase policy, the abandonment of the gold standard by the gold standard group is always inevitable. However, the United States is not without considering this point. The United States is hoping that France will abandon the gold standard in order to inflate the currency of the world. After the United States suspended the gold standard, the rate of price increase has already surpassed the rate of exchange rate decline (the price index in July was 103, which was 28% higher than in March, and the US dollar in July only fell by 22%). The decline in prices after August was mostly due to the response of prices to the exchange rate. Therefore, if the United States continues to raise prices, it must try its best to lower the value of the US dollar. For this reason, it cannot take care of other issues.</p>
<p>X X X</p>
<p>After the United States announced the purchase of gold on October 29, it seemed to have thrown a bomb on the world financial market. If you buy gold domestically, although the US dollar will fall, it will only cause unrest to the currencies of other countries. Once you buy overseas gold, not only will the US dollar fall, but also the cash of various countries will concentrate in the United States, which will fundamentally harm the financial markets of various countries. Let us look at the trend of the Anglo-American exchange rate and gold price before and after the US bought gold:</p>
<p>Date British Gold Price US Gold Price Anglo-American Exchange Rate</p>
<p>Shilling Yuan</p>
<p>October 24 128.01 29.80 4.7725</p>
<p>October 25 130.01 31.36 4.7325</p>
<p>November 1 131.09 32.26 4.80125</p>
<p>November 2 133.03 32.36 4.845</p>
<p>November 3 133.02 32.57 4.84125</p>
<p>November 4 132.04 32.67 4.8625</p>
<p>November 5 131.10 32.84 4.8925</p>
<p>November 6 129.11 32.84 4.91</p>
<p>The US gold purchase price on October 25 was 31.36 yuan, which was 1.56 yuan higher than on October 24. After that, it gradually increased, and the Anglo-American exchange rate also gradually rose. On November 5, it exceeded the old par value of 4.87, and it was rumored that the Anglo-American exchange rate ratio was established. It was confirmed to be inaccurate on the 6th. The US gold price was 33.05 yuan, and the Anglo-American exchange rate was 4.97 yuan. The exchange rate the day before yesterday (December 5) was still above the par value (5.12 yuan).</p>
<p>From the British point of view, the pound is expensive. The expensive pound can make the British currency contract, the industry shrink, and unemployment increase, which is exactly what Britain cannot tolerate. The tool for Britain to control the exchange rate is the Exchange Equalisation Account. If the pound continues to be expensive, Britain will definitely use the Equalisation Account to lower it. In this way, there will be a competition between England and the United States. On October 27, the US purchase price was 31.76, which was equal to 135 shillings and two pence for British gold. The London gold price was lower than 131 shillings and two pence, with a difference of four shillings. In this situation, if the United Kingdom does not raise the gold price, the London gold market will be completely absorbed. This forces the United Kingdom to follow the same path as the United States, reduce the pound price, and inflate the currency.</p>
<p>X X X</p>
<p>The pound and the US dollar have both performed a tragic drama of falling. Whether the franc can avoid this tragedy is quite hypothetical. We know that the most difficult position after the US bought gold is undoubtedly France. The United Kingdom has suspended the gold standard and can use the Exchange Equalisation Account to lower the pound. France still adheres to the gold standard and can never autonomously lower the value of the franc. France has an annual deficit budget of 10 billion francs and an annual trade surplus of about 10 billion francs. Although the reserves are very sufficient, for the benefit of the national economy, it seems that it is necessary to abandon the gold standard. A fiscal deficit of 10 billion francs and a trade surplus of 10 billion francs are enough to shake the foundation of the franc. Even a 100% reserve is difficult to be a barrier under the US gold purchase policy. Let us look at the gold prices in New York and Paris on October 28:</p>
<p>New York 31.8 yuan</p>
<p>Paris 30.8 yuan</p>
<p>The difference between them is one yuan. The Atlantic gold wheel shipping fee is only six cents per ounce of US dollar. Under such a difference, can the reserves of the Bank of France still be maintained?</p>
<p>The US gold purchase policy can never be suspended temporarily, and the extent of the US dollar's decline has not yet reached its limit, because the United States has not yet reached the lowest standard of currency value. This can be inferred from the following table and standards:</p>
<p>US Dollar Gold Amount Exchange Rate Decline Rate Gold Price Gold Price Increase Percentage</p>
<p>A Legal Par Value 23.2|| 20.7 ||</p>
<p>B 100 Francs = 6 Yuan 15.235 31.6 53</p>
<p>C Minimum Limit Reduced by the National Farmers Conference 15.5 43 36.2 75</p>
<p>D President's Reduction Authority 11.6 50 41.4 100</p>
<p>According to the above table, the current US currency value is only at the B stage. According to the recent situation, the United States is proceeding towards the CD two stages. If the US dollar falls into the CD two stages, the difference between the gold prices in New York and Paris will be as high as five or six yuan. If France does not suspend the gold standard, how can it prohibit the outflow of gold?</p>
<p>The franc is not only subject to the frontal attack of the US dollar, but also the side attack of the British pound. If the United Kingdom fixes the Anglo-French exchange rate at a price of one pound for 80 francs, then when the US dollar enters the CD two stages, the Anglo-American exchange rate will fall to 5.59 or 6.31 yuan, which is definitely not what the United Kingdom wants. For its own sake, the United Kingdom has to leave the franc and follow the US dollar, using the Equalisation Account to stabilize the Anglo-American exchange rate, then when the US dollar reaches the CD two stages, the Anglo-French exchange rate will fall to 70 francs or 62 francs. In this way, the franc is also oppressed by the British pound.</p>
<p>The double attack of the US dollar and the British pound will inevitably make the trend of France's trade deficit more serious, international lending worse, and the domestic economy shrink. In this way, it is necessary to suspend the gold standard.</p>
<h3 id="e271">Yang Xianxu on Social Insurance in Soviet Russia <a href="#e271" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c271" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">271</a></h3>
<p>The social insurance system in Soviet Russia is based on the Labor Law passed in 1922, which came into effect on November 15 of that year. It also applies to other republican nations within the Union. Initially, social insurance only covered workers facing physical danger, but in 1930, unemployed individuals also became eligible. The administration of this system is entirely in the hands of the Trade Union Federation, with funding coming from individual workers. I will now discuss the scope, administration, funding sources, and distribution methods of the program.</p>
<p>(1) Scope of the Program: Social insurance has a broad scope, covering all wage-earning workers regardless of their length of employment, nature of work, or method of compensation. However, the implementation of old-age pensions was slower and phased in gradually. The textile industry had it in 1927, while other basic industries began issuing them in 1929. By 1932, all industries were issuing pensions, except for temporarily employed workers. The number of insured individuals from 1924 to 1932 is shown in the table below:</p>
<p>Year　Number of Insured People</p>
<p>1925　6,700,000</p>
<p>1926　8,200,000</p>
<p>1927　9,000,000</p>
<p>1928　9,700,000</p>
<p>1929　10,500,000</p>
<p>1930　12,700,000</p>
<p>1931　17,150,000</p>
<p>1932　20,700,000</p>
<p>The number of insured people increased from 6.7 million in 1925 to 20.7 million in 1932, more than tripling in just a few years, which is a remarkably rapid development. (2) Administrative Overview: The characteristics of the Soviet social insurance administration include using the same methods for various risks, and the special relationship between fund management and the Trade Union Federation. Before 1931, all administrative functions were handled by committees composed of representatives elected by the Trade Union Federation. The funds were shared by various industries in a region, with only transportation workers insured by their industry's fund. However, after 1931, this regional organizational system underwent major reforms. To promote economic recovery and the various industries included in the Five-Year Plan, industry-specific funds were established, such as those for the copper and iron industry, machinery industry, coal mining industry, oil industry, chemical industry, and transportation industry. Workers in other industries were still covered by regional industry funds. On June 23 of this year, the Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union issued an order to completely abolish all regional funds, and the administration of insurance programs was entrusted to the Central Committee of the Trade Union Federation and its affiliated commercial organizations. In 1931, the seven industry-specific insurance funds covered over 5,316,000 workers. Although the number of regional industry funds decreased from 634 in 1924 to 401 in 1929, it gradually increased thereafter. In 1932, there were a total of 3,209 funds, including 1,147 industry-specific funds and 2,062 regional industry funds. The number of insured people reached 6,912,810, with 3,458,169 belonging to industry-specific insurance funds and 3,458,641 belonging to regional insurance funds.</p>
<p>(3) Sources of Funding: Funding comes from contributions from individual workers. The contribution rates differ between general workers and farmers, and among general workers, there are three different rates:</p>
<p>(1) Ordinary Rate: Applies to general businesses and those without specific rates. It is further divided into four categories based on the degree of risk in various businesses: 16% of wages for the first category, 18% for the second, 20% for the third, and 22% for the fourth. (2) Preferential Rate: Applies to workers in agencies funded by local or national expenditures, as well as postal and telecommunications services and state farms. This is further divided into three categories: 10% of wages for the first category, 12% for the second, and 14% for the third. (3) Special Rate: Applies to various construction businesses, etc. As for the contribution rates for farmers, they are divided into three categories based on economic and social conditions: 22% for middle peasants, 10% for collective farms, and 6% for poor peasants. In addition to contributing to the insurance fund, employees also contribute to a housing construction fund (at a rate of 0.76% to 1.65%) and a fund for training construction personnel.</p>
<p>The following table shows the total amount of these funds and the amount available for distribution per insured person from 1925 to 1931:</p>
<p>Year　Total Funds (Millions of Rubles)　Distribution Amount (Rubles)</p>
<p>1925　474.2　70.78</p>
<p>1926　703.4　85.78</p>
<p>1927　923.2　102.58</p>
<p>1928　1,050.2　182.85</p>
<p>1929　1,258.8　119.89</p>
<p>1930　1,796.0　141.42</p>
<p>1931　3,463.3　143.63</p>
<p>The figures for 1931 are only for the first nine months. The estimated amount for 1932 is 3.534 billion rubles, and the projected amount for 1933 is 4.431 billion.</p>
<p>(4) Insurance Benefits: Insurance benefits are available in the following situations: (1) Temporary or permanent loss of work capacity due to work-related injuries. (2) Old age and infirmity. (3) Death. (4) Unemployment.</p>
<p>Insurance benefits are not only provided in cash but also in kind, including medical supplies provided by the health committees of the seven republican nations within the Union. All insured persons, those without working ability, the elderly, and their families are eligible. The expenses are partly funded by the state and local sources, and there are also provisions for hospitals, maternity care, and appropriate food. The following table shows these expenses and their sources since 1930 (in millions of rubles):</p>
<p>Total Expenses for Medical Care, etc.　Percentage of Total Expenditure　Amount Drawn from Insurance Fund</p>
<p>1930　997　33.5　334.0</p>
<p>1931　1,306　39.1　510.0</p>
<p>1932　1,916　40.3　772.5</p>
<p>Cash benefits are provided according to the following conditions: (1) Temporary Loss of Work Capacity: Initially, those who temporarily lost their work capacity were paid their full wages during the period of inability to work. After 1929, this was slightly modified based on the nature of their industry and the length of their service in that industry. For example, workers in social services who have worked in the industry for more than three years receive full wages from the first day. Workers in industry and transportation only receive three-quarters of their wages for the first five days, and full wages from the sixth day onward. As for women who cannot work due to pregnancy and childbirth, they are paid their full wages for eight weeks before and after childbirth.</p>
<p>(2) Additional Benefits: There are three additional benefits: A. Women receive a maternity allowance during the maternity period. In 1932, the amount of the allowance ranged from 16 to 30 rubles depending on the location. After 1932, the minimum was set at 32 rubles. B. Nursing expenses are provided for a certain period. Before 1932, 4 to 8 rubles were given per month for nine months. Later, it was changed to a one-time payment of 45 rubles. C. Funeral expenses: A funeral allowance of 21 to 45 rubles is provided after the death of an insured person, depending on the location of death. However, after 1932, it was uniformly set at 40 rubles in cities and 20 rubles in rural areas.</p>
<p>(3) Permanent Loss of Work Capacity: Those who permanently lose their work capacity can be divided into three categories based on the degree of loss: the first category includes those who have completely lost their capacity and require care; the second category includes those who have completely lost their capacity and cannot work in their original industry or in other industries; and the third category includes those who cannot work in their original industry but still have some capacity to do some work or other easier tasks. Before 1932, work-related accidents resulting in the third category were the most common, while the first two categories were less common. However, after 1932, these three categories were completely abolished and replaced with the following two:</p>
<p>A. Those who cannot work due to reasons other than work-related accidents: In 1932, the amount of subsidies for this type of situation depended on the degree of loss of capacity, the amount of wages in their industry, and the circumstances of their place of residence. Since 1932, the amount of subsidies has been changed to depend on the importance of the insured person's position in the industry and the length of their service in that industry. For example, a worker who loses work capacity while working in the mining industry can receive 69% (the highest) of their original wage, and an additional 2% is added because they have served in the industry for more than ten years. (From ten to eighteen years, an additional 12% is added; from eighteen to twenty-three years, an additional 3% is added.) In total, they can receive 71% of their original wage. If they lose part of their work capacity and have served for more than eighteen years, they can receive 30% of their original wage, plus an additional 0.5% per year (from eighteen years onwards, an additional 0.5% is added for each year of service up to thirty-four years). Therefore, the maximum amount they can receive is 41% of their original wage. XXB. Those who cannot work due to work-related accidents: Before 1932, they were given 10% to 100% of their original wage. However, after that, those who have lost their work capacity and require care are given the full amount of their original wage. Those who have only lost all or part of their capacity are treated the same as those who cannot work due to non-work-related accidents. (4) Old-Age Pensions: Old-age pensions are granted to men who have served for 25 years and are over 60 years old, and to women who have served for 20 years and are over 55 years old. In 1932, old-age pensions ranged from 50% to 100% of the original wage, depending on the location. Since 1932, this has been changed to 50% to 60% of the original wage, depending on the industry of the insured person.</p>
<p>(5) Survivor Benefits: Survivor benefits should be provided to the families of workers who die from non-work-related accidents. In cities, one-third or three-quarters of the original wage is given depending on the number of applicants. In rural areas, 5.5 to 28 rubles are given per month, depending on the number of applicants. Since 1932, this survivor benefit has been changed to 50% to 125%. Families of workers who die from work-related accidents should be given survivor benefits. The amount is one-third to three-quarters of the deceased worker's original wage in cities, depending on the number of applicants, and 7 to 47 rubles per month for those working in rural agricultural areas.</p>
<p>In addition, before October 1930, there were subsidies for the unemployed, but these have long been abolished. | November 28</p>

<p>Last week, from December 11th to 16th, the Chinese Merchant Securities Market suddenly became stable, and trading also declined significantly. Both bulls and bears were largely holding back and watching, which has been rare in recent years. The situation is depressing, with no new developments. The representatives' negotiations have no concrete solutions, and the biggest disputes have not been effectively resolved. However, war may not break out suddenly, and peace is not yet hopeless. Opinions differ, and both sides have their own views, so the stalemate is intensifying. The end of the year is approaching, and it is unlikely that this stalemate will continue. On Monday, due to rumors that the war clouds in Fujian and Zhejiang were thickening, the bulls emerged, and prices fell by several jiao to about one yuan and a half. On Tuesday, the news was better, and war might be avoided. The bears slightly compensated, and market prices rebounded by several jiao to one yuan and three or four jiao. The one-day decline and one-day rise balanced out. On Wednesday, the situation remained depressing, and large investors made slight purchases, continuing to rise by several jiao. On Thursday, northern merchants slightly sold, and market prices hovered wearily, falling back by a small six or seven jiao. On Friday, due to the postponement of the Fourth Plenary Session, people's hearts were slightly uneasy, and prices fluctuated suddenly, falling slightly by three or four jiao. Although transactions were particularly small on Saturday, market prices rose slightly in each session, with a total increase of six or seven jiao. As a result, market prices showed mixed gains and losses, but the fluctuations were only within three to five jiao. The total transaction volume was 75.157 million yuan.

<p>(South Shanghai) The sources from various regions and those obstructed in the Minhang area have gradually arrived in port since the calm, so the arrivals are quite abundant, totaling over 50 late rice boats (over 7,000 shi), over 20 thick japonica and various colored rice boats (3-4000 shi), so it is difficult for late rice to be unaffected by the weekend. It continued to accept 3-4000 packages, and ultimately became oversupplied, with many remaining. As a result, the sellers were unable to improve the situation, and the market condition suddenly became weak, with prices falling by more than a foot. Although the various thick japonica rices, such as those from Lili, still accepted 2-300 packages, the shopkeepers were sluggish, like a drop in the bucket, unable to reverse the weak trend, and market prices fell by about 2 jiao. The scarce Dujian rice remained fixed, and the foreign rice followed, falling slightly. The Yinbian Yuan wine merchants were active, and it remains to be seen.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the sugar market trend was relatively stable.

<h3 id="e277">North-South Goods: Lanxi Candied Dates, Customer Prices Secretly Loosen <a href="#e277" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c277" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">277</a></h3>
<p>Lanxi candied dates have been sluggish in sales recently, and the market is very weak. It is also heard that customer goods are eager to sell, and the exchange rate is even looser. According to customer information yesterday, the price has secretly dropped by about 1 yuan. The market price is 22 yuan for peeled, and there are few transactions. However, the stock of Anhui goods is relatively low, and the trend is stable.</p>
<h3 id="e278">Oil Market: Tallow Oil, Han Market Drops Sharply <a href="#e278" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c278" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">278</a></h3>
<p>Tallow oil is supposed to be abundant during the new production season, but sales have actually decreased significantly compared to previous years. The biggest reason for this is the decline of rural areas. Furthermore, the Chen oil in Hankou still has reserves. The market in Hankou has been trending downward from autumn to winter. After the new oil came out, the weak trend has worsened. Macheng oil was able to hold on to around 17 yuan for more than a month, but now with the abundant arrival of new goods, it is even more difficult to maintain. According to yesterday's telegram from Hankou, Macheng oil has already fallen to 16 yuan 3 jiao, and yesterday's telegram showed another drop to 15 yuan 45 jiao. The strength of the price drop is unprecedented in the second half of the year. In addition, the source is connected, and sales are blocked, so there is no possibility of a turnaround in the short term. As for the Zhejiang route, initially, because the Chen oil was selling well, there was a brief period of good sales when the new oil came out. New goods in the areas of Jinhua and Lanxi in eastern Zhejiang were purchased at 16 yuan, and then rose to 17 yuan. In Jiaxing and other places in western Zhejiang, the opening price was 19 yuan, which increased to 21 yuan. Recently, since the Fujian incident occurred, the impact has been felt, and Lanxi tallow has returned to 16 yuan and 15 yuan 78 jiao. The price of japonica oil in Hebei is also falling to 19 yuan 56 jiao. The above are all prices in the production areas. Lanxi is not sold in Shanghai, but the japonica oil from Hebei is needed by candle manufacturers in Shanghai. The current market price for delivery to Shanghai is between 20 yuan and 23 jiao. There have been slight transactions in recent days, but after the sharp drop in the Han market, people inevitably hope for lower prices, so merchants are not enthusiastically purchasing. However, because it is the right time for candle making, the scattered transactions in the market are not too deserted.</p>
<h3 id="e279">White Tung Oil, Zhejiang Route Slightly Firm <a href="#e279" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c279" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">279</a></h3>
<p>White tung oil in the Han market has been falling continuously due to sluggish foreign sales. The Zhejiang route is gradually weakening due to the impact of the current situation. The market conditions in both the North and South are trending in the same direction. Yesterday's telegram from foreign merchants in the Han market showed a drop to 22 yuan. Although there were transactions of 100-200 tons, with the abundant production of new goods, the source is quite abundant, and the market is still oversupplied. Domestic sales are also in a slump during the winter season, so it is difficult to expect a turnaround in the short term. Before the Zhejiang tung oil, due to the impact of the Fujian incident, people were understandably panicked in Jinhua and Lanxi in eastern Zhejiang, which are close to the Fujian border. As a result, the price of Lanxi tung oil fell first, and Hangzhou merchants also stopped purchasing. The market price fell to 19 yuan per dan for spot delivery, and transactions also became quiet. However, recently the situation on the Zhejiang border has gradually become more stable, and commercial activity has slightly increased, so the tung oil market has slightly recovered. According to recent news, Hangzhou merchants have sent people to Shanghai to sell oil, and the price is 20 yuan and 2 jiao for delivery to Shanghai, which shows that they seem to be more energetic than a few days ago. Although there are not many transactions, the market conditions are showing signs of activity. It is hoped that the situation will not change again, so the market will not face the risk of further decline. However, the Han market is the center of foreign trade, and since the market has been weak and difficult to revive, the Zhejiang tung oil will inevitably be restrained by it. Although the Zhejiang tung oil can be unique for a while, it must ultimately rely on the Han market.</p>

<p>Yesterday, hardware transactions were even quieter. Customers and factories were not purchasing, and the number of transactions in the construction industry was also not high, so the entire market was very deserted. However, there were many new arrivals of Dongyang cargo yesterday, so western goods were mostly dragged down by them. According to the arrival of goods last week, there were more than 3,000 bundles, and there are still thousands of bundles being shipped or not yet arrived, so the future market situation is not easy to be optimistic about.</p>

<h3 id="e281">A FURTHER EXPLANATION FOR IMPOSING INHERITANCE TAX <a href="#e281" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c281" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">281</a></h3>
<p>— Non-Person</p>
<p>According to recent telegraphic dispatches, the financial authorities are planning to levy an inheritance tax. The implementation method will soon be realized. In various countries, inheritance tax is originally one of the direct taxes, and it occupies a very important position in national finance. However, no matter how wonderful and good a system is in other countries, if it is implemented in our country, it will be ruined and become sour orange. This is a tried and tested result.</p>
<p>Taking inheritance tax as an example, truly wealthy people would rather pay interest to deposit their money in foreign banks. If they hear that inheritance tax is implemented, depositing money in foreign banks will definitely be more enthusiastic. Those who can be collected from will only be the middle and lower-class asset class. As for those who are particularly powerful and wealthy, national laws inherently cannot reach them. In this way, it will only be a great boon for foreign bankers. As for the country, in reality, it will not gain any benefits. This is an obvious thing.</p>
<p>This point is just a hypothetical prediction that I make based on the inheritance tax system. In fact, when creating a system, on the one hand, it is for the sake of the country, and on the other hand, it is naturally even more for the sake of the people. If the inheritance tax is levied, it is only for the sake of the country and not for the sake of the people. If both sides are to be taken into account and both benefit, then the inheritance system must be abolished. As for the reason, please allow me to slowly explain it after I finish my cigarette.</p>
<p>Too much money is harmful to descendants. History and reality in society have proclaimed this fact to us, and examples are too numerous to mention. As the saying goes, "No outstanding children come from families of silk-clad idlers." The ancients said: "It is better to accumulate virtue for your descendants than to accumulate wealth for them." And: "It is better to teach your children a classic than to accumulate wealth for them." To be honest, accumulating money for descendants is not creating blessings for them, but harming them. The ancients, with their "firefly" bellies, saw this very clearly.</p>
<p>Although what the ancients said is not wrong, it is only thinking of descendants from a one-sided perspective, without thoroughly thinking of oneself. Look at the people in the world today, all are strong, fierce, tyrannical, demanding, mean, ungrateful, exploitative, and greedy, using all means to accumulate hundreds of thousands of fortunes, but they are not satisfied. They must accumulate millions. Accumulating millions is not enough. They still want to accumulate tens of millions, to the point that they want to scrape all the wealth in the world for themselves. Such people who "stretch out their hands from the coffin and still want more" can be said to be everywhere.</p>
<p>I want to ask, among the millions or tens of millions accumulated, how much can they enjoy themselves? As the saying goes, "Empty hands come, empty hands go." Even if you accumulate gold as high as the Big Dipper, you can't transport it to the underworld. In the end, you are just being a beast of burden for your descendants for a lifetime, living a big dream. As for the descendants, they become extravagant and degenerate, or they fight for the inheritance, even breaking up the family, or they may even give the money to mistresses to find lovers. Truly, ill-gotten gains can never be permanently preserved. Therefore, Confucius said: "Acting with self-interest in mind leads to much resentment."</p>
<p>Why do people become corrupt officials? Why do they become traitors? Why do they become unscrupulous merchants? Why do they do everything that harms others and benefits themselves? In a word, it is all for the sake of their descendants. If the inheritance system is abolished, it would be a targeted solution, a fundamental remedy. Therefore, I say that it is more appropriate to abolish the inheritance system than to levy inheritance tax.</p>
<h3 id="e282">SHANGHAI'S GLOOMY SIDE <a href="#e282" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c282" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">282</a></h3>
<p>— Wen</p>
<p>The Shanghai that the leisure class, immersed in pleasure, knows is only the superficial side, adorned with "civilization" and "order." What is reflected from this side is only the satisfaction and intoxication in all aspects of clothing, food, housing, transportation, sex, and entertainment, which are exchanged for a "spending money like dirt" lifestyle. For example, the gorgeous dresses of 1934, the large dishes costing twenty or thirty yuan each, the tens or even hundreds of gold spent per day, the hotel rooms equipped with styles from various countries, the luxurious and brisk motor cars, the smooth and trembling thighs and breasts, the radios that can listen to world sound waves, the bright and colorful neon lights, and all the endless pleasures of wine, women, songs and horses are readily available in this "Paris of the East." The only question is: are your gentlemen's purses full?</p>
<p>However, in this Shanghai, which accommodates many British, Chinese, and foreign people, the "high-class Chinese" foreigners with "money to burn" are, after all, an absolute minority. The "lower class," who make up more than ninety percent, and who have fallen into the starvation line and the slave layer, are living a life of dripping blood, sweating, struggling, and waiting for death. Therefore, on every page of the "bright side" of urban life, which is full of gold and extravagance, there is a tragic, serious, and unimaginable gloomy side mixed in. As we see through this contrasting life of heaven and hell, we must not only feel the irrationality of the current urban life, but also think of the terrible fate of the future of the social enjoyment class, which is too small in quantity and too poor in quality.</p>
<p>In the towering buildings of the Cathay Hotel, the Palace Hotel, or the Astor House Hotel, one can overlook the sky and look down on the world. Inside the windows and doors, there is air conditioning and electric fans in the hot summer, and radiators and electric stoves in the winter. Such a place is of course considered a "paradise on earth" in Shanghai life. However, just a few or a dozen feet away outside the window, countless coolies are loading and unloading heavy goods while uttering "Heave-ho" sounds under the "creaking" sound of the cranes on the ships, enduring the scolding or "abuse" of the foremen. At the same time, the "respected arm" of the foremen is often cocked in preparation for accepting "kickbacks." This is just two polar opposite pictures separated by a piece of glass from the life inside the aforementioned hotels!</p>
<p>If someone believes that this huge metropolis lacks "security" and "order" because they see the endless cases of murder, kidnapping, rape, and robbery in Shanghai, then perhaps that is their "mistake." "Order" cannot be sought in factory areas or slums. To see the "order" of Shanghai, you must go to the corner of Carlton and Jing'an Temple Road, the intersection of Avenue Joffre and Avenue Petain, and those places on Avenue Albert to investigate. Whenever the movies end, the Jai Alai and dog racing begin or end, there are extra Chinese and foreign patrol officers stationed there to chase away "idlers," whip rickshaw pullers, and arrange a large number of cars in orderly rows. The Carlton, New Light, or Great Light theaters swallow and spit out thousands of old and young men and women who have a sense of gentility three times a day. Whenever it is 8:30 or 11:00 when the show ends, every corner of the several roads surrounding these three major theaters is filled with loafers who listen to your accent and pretend to be "fellow villagers" to ask for copper coins, and prostitutes who have to go back to "starvation" if they cannot get any "business." The Central Stadium and the Cathay Theatre, a "three-dimensional building," face each other from afar. On Avenue Joffre, which is full of "exotic flavors" and "mysterious scents," in addition to the gambling of the foreign gangsters with "Hail, Hail" and the sensual and erotic movies, there are "massage parlors" that offer "steaming, washing, rubbing, and massaging" all four services for one dollar, and all kinds of Russian secret dens. In that mysterious street, you can always meet Russian loafers who raise their thumbs at you and shout the slogan "Chinese, very good!" in exchange for one or two copper coins. Dear readers! You must remember: these "poor" but deserving Russian men and women were the most adept at extravagance and pleasure-seeking in the era when "the aura of the Tsar had not yet faded" in Petrograd! Beyond the solemn Soochow Road Police Station, the large section west of the Big Bell Tower is the base camp for many "opium dens," and the area around East and West New Bridge and the Great World is even more of a "defense line" with "women soldiers" forcibly pulling or carrying "country bumpkins" every five steps, ten steps a post. All of these "ghosts and monsters" are openly displayed on the roads like harmonious buildings and prosperous commerce. It is completely a human hell, not just the gloomy side of the metropolis!</p>
<p>The Wutong Road near Jing'an Temple and Yuyuan Road is long and slightly unstained, and various villas and alleys are so neat and luxurious, but in the factory area around Caojiadu, countless men and women workers with emaciated faces and calloused hands are constantly breathing air full of coal smoke and living in pigeon cages where "eating, drinking, sleeping, and defecating" are completed in a six-foot square space. Further away, the shantytowns around Sun Temple and Qingyun Road in Zhabei are even using straw and wood chips as building materials and flatbread and fried dough sticks as precious food. If they encounter a disaster where "the heavens do not open their eyes," a fire or a gust of north wind can leave them with nothing, causing death and destruction! However, the number of workers and shantytown dwellers is dozens of times greater than the wealthy people living in spacious mansions and hotels!</p>
<h3 id="e283">A CHAT ABOUT FRIENDSHIP <a href="#e283" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c283" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">283</a></h3>
<p>— Burial</p>
<p>丨丨 Presented to Brother Yi Ping 丨丨</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, the "Pained Heart" that I wrote in a panic after my father passed away actually received your sincere comfort! In fact, why is this unexpected? Usually, when I read your essays and novels, every word reveals sincerity! It was two or three months ago, wasn't it, that you published a series of articles describing your friend's illness, writing about how you were concerned and running around for your friend, and writing about how upright your new friend Fei was, all of which made people feel relaxed and refreshed, and made them feel that their wounded lives were washed anew. Even in our brief meeting, the impression you gave me was very deep: straightforward in speech, pure in expression, deep and sharp in your eyes丨丨丨 everything! Precisely because of this, only you can understand the "Pained Heart" of a new friend you had only met once. However, because I am used to seeing the ferocious faces of ordinary people, applying my usual standards, I could not help but be a little surprised when I suddenly saw your words, thinking that it was unexpected. This is, of course, my unprotectable guilt, and it is also the reason why we have so few opportunities to get together.</p>
<p>Because of this, it has stirred up my understanding of friendship. In this society, no matter in which corner, friendship can generally be divided into three types: First, hypocritical friendship, which is pretending a dead face as a living face, and perfunctorily dealing with others with smooth talk; second, friendship of interest, which unites and becomes affectionate when there is benefit, and separates and becomes distant when there is harm. The rise and fall of this friendship is entirely measured by interest. One moment it is as warm as a molten blob of sealing wax, and another it is as incompatible as ice and coal; third, sardonic friendship. In this capitalist society, all forms are originally a sardonic performance, and friendship cannot avoid this model. Many people come and go in sardonic laughter. The defect of these three types of friendship is the lack of "sincerity." It can simply be said that not a trace of sincerity can be found. The bond between each other is all hypocrisy, self-interest, and sardonic laughter. This is a reflection of the hateful real society, and it is also the wound of the entire human life. We cannot feel the invasion of this wound, we need sincere friendship. From a certain social consciousness, so-called sincere friendship seems to be a trivial matter, and there is no need to praise it so much. However, my temperament is just destined to be like this. I deeply feel that human beings are not only rational animals, but also emotional ones. Reason must be nourished by emotion in order for life to be fulfilled and rich. Therefore, I am often afraid of the famine of life, and I eagerly thirst for the irrigation of sincere friendship.</p>
<p>Having lived for twenty-three years, in terms of the strength of friends, I am not considered to have many, but not few either. But many have disappointed me, making me retreat, because they mostly treat me with general friendship. When I approach them, I feel cramped, I feel heartbroken! I want to get rid of these and pursue those. In the past two years, I jumped out of school and climbed into society. Although life has been hitting walls everywhere, I am privately fortunate to have met several sincere friends that I have been longing for in my life. Our interaction has completely broken away from the dead shells of hypocrisy, self-interest, and sardonic laughter. We are all walking hand in hand on the path of sincere friendship. This makes me feel the loveliness of human beings and the worthiness of life. From now on, my life will be entirely promoted by this!</p>
<p>Needless to say, you are another one I long for! You have become a flower in my life! I don't know if you are willing? I am a little timid, because my own resources are very scarce, and my life is too narrow! Precisely because of this, I dare not easily try to find new friends, and that is why I have not met you again or corresponded with you since our "one-sided" meeting. But today, I have deeply recognized you. Perhaps you have the same intentions as me 丨丨 needing a lower-level friend like me. Then, friend, let us walk hand in hand on the path of sincere friendship!</p>
<p>Finally, thank you for your comfort. My hometown does not belong to me. I must return to that place, that is my hometown, and it is not far away. My father has passed away, and I will seek to repay him through the life he left me! At the same time, I advise you, old brother: don't be sad that your father died when you were two years old!</p>
<h3 id="e284">SCOIDING <a href="#e284" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c284" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">284</a></h3>
<p>— Yi Ping</p>
<p>Our country claims to be an ancient civilization in the world, so it has done special research on the art of scolding. From the time when children write "XXX is really not good" and "XXX little know-it-all" on other people's black walls, to scolding people as "running dogs" and "traitors"... announcing "ten major crimes," there are numerous classes, too many to list. As for scolding other people's ancestors for eight generations and their reproductive organs, it is even a small matter and not worth mentioning!</p>
<p>Perhaps because my surname has a slightly similar pronunciation to the name of a certain famous writer, I have been scolded as a copycat. Although I wrote a statement, I regretted it afterwards. No matter how I said that the two characters "Yi Ping" have had a relationship with me for twenty-five years, and that the surname Zhang is even inherited from my ancestors and I have not been adopted into another surname, it is something that cannot be helped. But statements are statements, and you will still be scolded. Isn't writing an additional statement just asking for more scolding? However, why are you spending so much energy to tease an unknown person like me? Perhaps it is because of the sins committed by old man Xiao when he came to Shanghai!</p>
<p>This year, I have written a few more "Love Stories" in this publication, and have added the title of petty bourgeois to the head of a poor kid like me who lives in a garret. Originally, those of us who were not born with good fortune cannot obtain the life of the petty bourgeoisie even if we seek it. Writing articles (?) is just to cheat manuscript fees. "Love Stories" are fine, or random nonsense is fine. Filling the manuscript paper, passing through the eyes of the editor, and then being set in lead type by the printer and printed in the newspaper is all that matters. No matter what is written, I don't expect to print any separate editions. A thousand words becomes three dollars, no matter where it comes from! And I am not blessed to receive this malicious compliment of petty bourgeois. I respectfully return it to that gentleman.</p>
<p>Recently, "Shanghai" was published in this publication. The pen name is Lao San. Besides the editor of this publication and my close friends, no third person knows about it. Two weeks ago, I received a letter, which was forwarded from our radio communications office, without a signature. The person who wrote the letter scolded me like scolding someone's ancestors for eight generations. Finally, he asked me why Xu Huiqin in Shanghai was written as such a typical woman. So I became paranoid and thought that the gentleman (?) who wrote the letter was defending my ideal Xu Huiqin. But how can he (?) know that Lao San is my pen name? Of course, it is not out of the scope of the first or second type of people. I asked the editor of this publication, and the answer was that no one came to inquire who Lao San was. But my close friends, I believe that there is no such boring person who would deliberately change his handwriting, bury his name, and play such a joke on me. I hope that the gentleman (?) who wrote the letter will give me a chance to meet. I want to personally ask for advice, or it may make the gentleman (?) feel more comfortable. I don't know what the gentleman (,) thinks?</p>

<p>— Bei</p>
<p>My friend is not Hu Shih, but Man, who is imprisoned in prison.</p>
<p>On the eve of the "January 28th Incident," we had met and talked about the current affairs. After the Japanese soldiers casually attacked one night, we all fell into the abyss of terror, and the connection of meetings was cut off in a few days. One day I met Long on the road, and he said urgently: "Man has found a connection, and he has a letter for you." At that time, I really found it strange and strange. The timing was so terrifying, and he was such an arrogant character, how could he find a connection? I couldn't help but blurt out "Don't talk nonsense!" "You're right, this is the letter he asked me to give you, see what's written inside?" Long said seriously, and at the same time took out Man's crookedly written leaf of letter paper and handed it to me:</p>
<p>"Friend, I didn't expect that after not seeing each other for a few days, we are separated by a world! On the night of the 30th, I originally planned to squeeze in to sleep at Fan Na'er's, but several of his female relatives escaped and came over, so I had no choice but to think of another way: I walked out, and just as I reached the corner of □□□ Road □□□ Road, I was stopped by two police officers, who ordered me to stop. Then they searched my body extensively, even grabbed a few times under my crotch. As a result, they found my diary and several letters from friends that were completely unrelated in the pocket of my undershirt next to my skin. So they said that during this martial law period, I was quite suspicious, and took me to the police station, and then to the court, and without any explanation, they sentenced me to five years in prison for endangering the Republic of China. Friend, you should think of a way for me!"</p>
<p>"Ah, so that's how it is, injustice, injustice, it's really injustice 丨 but it is indeed a temporary connection!" Only then did I understand Long's meaning, and I added a word of praise to Man's unjust encounter in the same tone.</p>
<p>"Really, don't talk nonsense anymore, it's not fun after all. Let's find a lawyer to appeal for him!" Long became anxious, so we went to find a former teacher together. The teacher introduced us to a lawyer. After we explained the facts, the lawyer repeatedly shook his head and asked: "Is his family well-off?" "Not very good!" The lawyer shook his head again and said: "Then it's difficult! It's a political prisoner! Political prisoners have no money..." The rest was a smile with a frown. After talking left and right, we finally agreed to trouble him for one hundred yuan, and the lawyer agreed hesitantly: "I can only not count so much." This made us extremely excited, as if Man was standing right in front of us. So we wrote a letter to Man's house, saying that he was very ill and needed to find a way to send one hundred yuan to treat him.</p>
<p>Man wanted me to see him, God knows. I went at nine o'clock in the morning, and waited until half past twelve before we were allowed to meet each other through a small iron fence opening the size of a vegetable bowl. We could not see his face, and could only listen to his voice carefully. Man said: "Bei, it's you who came. First I tell you, the cashier of the detention center took five yuan of my oil. Please go and negotiate for me!..." The supervising bailiff became furious: "The prisoner still doesn't follow the rules, scolding people casually, cancel the visit!" "XXX your mother, XXX your mother!" Man scolded even more fiercely in the prison. The limited five minutes passed by in a hurry, so we can say that we didn't talk about anything at all.</p>
<p>Coming out, I was very angry and went to find the cashier of the detention center, but they ignored me.</p>
<p>After that, a long time passed without the money being sent. I was also busy with my life, so I only sent him some food and newspapers. It was not until last winter that I got another letter from him. He said: "The appeal has been ruled again, still five years, and the five yuan is still being used to buy old oil. Only a bottle of chili oil was received from some food, and the newspapers and magazines were not delivered at all." From this, we can regret that the one hundred yuan lawyer's appeal fee was just like throwing it into the river, without even a bubble rising. The latest news from Man made me very excited. He said that he would no longer fight any laws with those dogs, and he did not want to appeal for injustice or dream of any commutation of sentence or amnesty for the time being. He is now concentrating on studying, preparing for the real struggle in the future. He has mastered a foreign language, and is proficient in French.</p>
<p>Yes, Man, this is the appropriate treatment for you! As long as you have a life, you will have the tools to fight. The short five years have passed, and the world is still yours! Although you have suffered injustice this time, it is the beginning of your true life! At present, this world is originally a huge prison, friend, be patient! Work hard! Lay the foundation for you to reverse the era after you are released from prison! (The End)</p>

<p>I can't believe that a vagrant who escaped from his stepmother is immersed in the embrace of two different types of women. I remember dreaming of my father, that serious face, that serious voice. Although I have not left my younger brother, how can this kind of life be what I hoped for when I left my hometown? Two months of entanglements on the bed have been my undeniable fact. "You have been surrounded by women!" The voice of that serious father is forever remembered in my heart.</p>
<p>One clear morning, I received a letter from my cousin, sent by someone. My uncle's matter required me to go to Xujiahui. I seemed very ashamed. I have been in Shanghai for almost a year, and the old cotton robe on my body is even more tattered. If the doorman always puts on a face of a superior seeing a subordinate, it would be very good. I am really afraid of seeing the humble young master who is in every way higher than me in formality; but this may be the opportunity for us young people that my cousin said. If I want to escape the surrounding reality, I must first get rid of the cage of the Zhengyi Society.</p>
<p>Finally, I arrived at the iron gate of Fangwai Villa like a thief. As if he was waiting for me, the doorman's head was already smiling in front of me before I raised my hand to press the doorbell. However, the loud voice of "young master" was replaced by his sneaky words. As I stepped sideways through the iron gate, he leaned slightly and said by my side:</p>
<p>"Young master, please go to the living room first, Miss is waiting."</p>
<p>I glanced at him, and he went back to the guard room with a smiling face. With a ghost in my heart, after walking through the stone-paved path, my cousin jumped out at the door of the Western-style house, like a cute kitten. She took my hand and walked into the living room, with the first sentence: "Sit for a while, father has not gotten up yet."</p>
<p>"Is that the reason?"</p>
<p>"No!" A cigarette came with a charming smile "Dad recently made a deal and earned tens of thousands. He is happy every day. He promised me to buy a ring. I said that you have been in Shanghai for almost a year, and you are still living in a friend's house. You had a serious illness the other day. Let Dad arrange a seat for him."</p>
<p>"Thank you." I feel that there is nothing to be surprised about.</p>
<p>"Who wants you to thank you!" Sister Hui stamped her leather shoes on the floor with a strange sound "I want to tell you first, don't let the two people's words say different things." A kind of satisfied smile cannot be concealed no matter what.</p>
<p>"Then I have to thank you even more!"</p>
<p>"Don't be so long-winded, let's go see Dad."</p>
<p>"Uncle hasn't gotten up yet?"</p>
<p>"He should be up." Sister Hui looked at the clock on the wall, "Isn't it eleven o'clock?"</p>
<p>I looked at her face and felt that this time I came to Fangwai Villa was escaping from one cage and entering another.</p>

<h3 id="e287">An Interview with Chinese Film Artists (28) (Continued from the 6th of this Month) <a href="#e287" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c287" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">287</a></h3>
<p>— Sha Ji</p>
<p>12. "New Year's Eve" Director Jiang Qifeng (Part 1)</p>
<p>I remember when "New Year's Eve" premiered at the Beijing Grand Theater, everyone was amazed by it. Not only were some of the shots beautifully composed, but the structure of the story, being able to create a film of around 10,000 feet in such a short period, was truly not easy. Similar examples include "Grand Hotel" or the British "Rome Express," and the upcoming MGM's "Dinner at Eight." The Star Motion Picture Company's "Twenty-Four Hours" (directed by Shen Xiling) is also like this…</p>
<p>"New Year's Eve" is unforgettable. Therefore, I went to Lianhua Studio One to interview the creator. In a small reception room, we each had a cup of strong tea in front of us. We smoked, and white smoke clouds swirled above our heads. The yellow chrysanthemums in the corner had already withered, hiding in the dark corner, afraid to move. Pale gray light poured down from the skylight in the roof, making me feel the solemnity of the air.</p>
<p>Mr. Jiang was wearing a cotton robe made of genuine domestic fabric, and on his feet were just eight-cornered cloth shoes. His simple demeanor moved me at first. After I stated my purpose, he was full of humility. He first explained that he could not speak "Mandarin," so I occasionally spoke with him in a Shanghai accent.</p>
<p>Our conversation was in a question-and-answer format. I said, "Mr. Jiang, what are your opinions on the current state of Chinese cinema?"</p>
<p>"In my personal opinion, although Chinese cinema has changed, it is still very empty. In this regard, Chinese film practitioners need the practical assistance of critics. That is to say, to revitalize Chinese cinema, critics must urge and encourage the creators. This is because the bystander sees the game, but the player is blind..."</p>
<p>"However, in fact, we are now facing what seems to be a serious period, and some writers inevitably want to regress. What attitude does Mr. Jiang take?"</p>
<p>"That's hard to say... Perhaps my will is very weak... However, I always firmly believe that movies cannot be separated from the masses. We must always make things that are needed by the public. Anything that the public needs, we must boldly do."</p>
<p>In his smiling humility, he vaguely revealed a firm attitude. Afterwards, I asked again, "Please say something about your own works."</p>
<p>"Well, to be honest, I am not satisfied with any of my own works. Counting it up, I have been in the film industry for ten years, but I have made no progress. At the beginning, I was at the Great China-United Film Company. Later, I was delayed in various small companies for a long time. But the environment of small companies is not good, and I was ruined in such a bad environment. After arriving at Lianhua, there is comparatively more room for development."</p>
<p>"What are your opinions on 'New Year's Eve'?"</p>
<p>"'New Year's Eve' has a complicated plot, and its significance is not sound. However, I had a lot of bitterness in filming this film. The director suffered a lot and lost a lot. At that time, because everyone was not filming, and I just happened to have no script." (To be continued)</p>
<p>Film Review</p>
<h3 id="e288">Review of "Love in the Wilds" <a href="#e288" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c288" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">288</a></h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>Ladies They Talk About</p>
<p>| Warner Bros. Production, Cathay Screening |</p>
<p>Impressionistic criticism is certainly dissatisfying to readers, and the friends who write such criticisms—at least myself—always feel very distressed. Criticizing literature or drama is the same. Before starting to criticize, one must fully grasp the entire work before beginning to write out one's opinions in a relatively in-depth way. However, current film critics do not have this possibility. After watching it once, they must hurriedly write articles. No matter how sensitive a person is, they cannot write a perfectly complete critique. This does indeed make me feel very uneasy. I hope that friends in the same field can come up with a better way to solve this difficulty.</p>
<p>For example, in this "Love in the Wilds," I can only write out a few very simple opinions based on my impressions.</p>
<p>(1) The author tries to beautify the prison as much as possible, which is most inconsistent with the life emotions of the Chinese people. There are gardens and beautiful smoking rooms in the prison. Female prisoners each have an exquisite room. They play phonographs, sing, play the piano, and hang photos of their lovers on the walls. This is definitely not a prison, but a nursing home. I think some of the readers may be willing to live there for a year or two.</p>
<p>However, the author has intentions. This is linked to the theme of using the Bible and love to influence criminals. The beautification of the prison is an important refutation. Originally, the author did not need to bother to describe it.</p>
<p>(2) Praising the merits of Protestantism is the main content of the work. But do we see that the heroine's female thief is completely influenced by the religion? Rather than saying that the power of God has influenced the soul of the criminal, it is more accurate to say that the Protestant working in the court softened her with his enthusiasm.</p>
<p>(3) However, exaggerating love so much is also unbelievable. For example, the female criminal shoots her lover, but the injured person can bear the pain to defend her without any resentment.</p>
<p>Moreover, the personality of the male protagonist is also very contradictory. On the one hand, we see him being impassioned and generous, seemingly an amazing hero. But he is so gentle and obedient to the female prisoner, especially since the woman has nothing lovable about her. The screenwriter's explanation is that she possesses superhuman magic.</p>
<p>(4) The director's greatest success is clearly and understandably narrating the story. However, there are several well-controlled scenes. The fun and quirky gimmicks are the forte of American artists.</p>
<p>(5) The playwright's imagination is indeed rich. Such as printing a key model on soap, looking at letters in the laundry box, and pre-arranging the bank robbery. Are these useful lessons for society?</p>
<p>Well, all I can write is these impressions, nothing more.</p>
<h3 id="e289">Review of "New Woman" <a href="#e289" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c289" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">289</a></h3>
<p>— Moore</p>
<p>Lady With A Past</p>
<p>"New Woman" followed "Modern Don Quixote" in being screened in Nanjing. "Modern Don Quixote" was adapted by experts based on a "famous work of world literature, and it gathered first-class talents in film and vocal music for production. Its result was so tragic (only showing for four days) that I cannot help but lament the monopolization of artistic appreciation, and I feel even more strongly the need for truly popular film productions. On the one hand, because of the box-office success of the films starring Heifetz about male and female affairs, I feel the weakness of the effect of new film criticism. Furthermore, I feel that attention should be paid to the criticism of the form determined by the consciousness and content of the film. I am deeply worried about the danger of new critics being fascinated by the old forms (such as praise for having interest in the old forms.)"</p>
<p>The translated title "New Woman" is very inconsistent with its original meaning. "Lady with a Past" was originally a stage play, but now it has been brought to the screen and presented in a comedic way.</p>
<p>Recently, after the close attention of many friends, American films have gradually abandoned purely fantasy themes and have returned to social reality. (Warner Bros.' attention to exposing films, which caused a sensation for a while, is clear evidence of this.) "New Woman" is undoubtedly a relatively realistic film. Of course, the story is still about male and female love, but it is no longer about talented men and beautiful women falling in love at first sight. It writes about how a rich girl goes from being silent in nature to having extensive social interactions, being romantic and frivolous: there is a certain inevitable relationship in the middle, or at least conditions. It writes about how a handsome young man does not dare to offend a dignified and self-respecting girl, but is infatuated with a enchanting and romantic prostitute. It writes about how viscounts pursue women because "Fan (the heroine) is rich, and they think marrying her can lead to wealth," thus exposing the face of the doctrine of love above all else. Not only that, it also adds bankruptcy to the viscount's suicide, in addition to being lovelorn, so that his suicide does not make the audience feel impossible or unrealistic. The best thing is that it writes about the young man and Donna, who he had not paid much attention to, coming together after a series of personal storms and a new awakening. This is where the screenwriter succeeds.</p>
<p>As for the director, I think the most successful thing is the inner description of the girl and the boy. The confusion and contradiction when the boy loves the girl but does not dare to court her, the hesitation when the enchanting prostitute seduces him, and the fact that he knows the prostitute's character but is involuntarily captivated by her beauty; all of these are perfectly portrayed. As for the girl's inner distress when she first falls in love, as well as her progress after experiencing a period of time, and her final hesitation, it can be said that there is no place that is not reasonable and in line with human emotions. This is of course due to their (including all producers) life experiences, and this is also the reason why this film ultimately became an old art, and its value is limited in this place.</p>
<p>Under the director's guidance, the performances of the male and female leads achieved everything that was needed without any regrets.</p>
<h3 id="e290">Film Industry Sports: Yi Hua vs. Great China University <a href="#e290" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c290" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">290</a></h3>
<p>— Bi Mei</p>
<p>The last time Yi Hua Company competed in football against Jiaotong University and Lianhua Company, they fought dozens of rounds. If Yue Feng, the goalkeeper for Yi Hua, had worked a little harder, Lianhua would have been defeated! However, although the two sides did not see victory or defeat, Yi Hua's football skills earned them the nickname "Iron Army" in the film industry.</p>
<p>After Jin Yan and Gong Jianong launched the film industry track and field competition, the Yi Hua Iron Army suddenly felt that they had no place to use their heroism. However, several athletes did not slack off because of this, and they continued to practice hard during their spare time after meals.</p>
<p>Sure enough, the news spread and excited the academic community. The day before yesterday (14th), the "Roaring Basketball Team" of Great China University, led by nearly ten brave generals and many cheerleaders, went to the Yi Hua Company's sports field to compete in basketball. At that time, Yi Hua carefully selected their elites, and they obtained "Zha Ruilong, Hu Rui, Zha Ruigen, Wang Chunquan, and Yao Gengfu" to compete against them.</p>
<p>At exactly 3:20, the Yi Hua sports field was filled with war cries. The two armies fought hard five times. The generals of Great China University were all familiar with the ropes and dealt with each other from all sides. However, Zha Ruigen of Yi Hua Company worked very hard. Once he had the ball in hand, it was as if it was tied with a string. Every shot went in, and he jumped extremely high. As a result, Great China University scored 33 points, and Yi Hua scored 38 points. Great China University lost by 5 points. It was already dusk, so they each withdrew their troops. (Rewarding)</p>
<h3 id="e291">The Play-within-a-Play in "A Movie Star" <a href="#e291" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c291" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">291</a></h3>
<p>"A Movie Star," which has been promoted for a long time, was completely completed a few days ago. About four days ago, the Tianyi photography studio was bustling with activity, re-shooting a play-within-a-play scene. In this scene, we can see the actual work in the photography studio, male and female protagonists, extras, directors, cinematographers, script supervisors, and all the workers, as well as… things we rarely see, are all exposed here. Many people envy the life of a movie star, thinking that it is a very interesting and meaningful job, and they all want to step into the silver sea to try it out. It would even be good to go to the photography studio to take a look. Wait, don't miss this "A Movie Star."</p>
<h3 id="e292">Film Novel Little Women (13) <a href="#e292" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c292" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">292</a></h3>
<p>— Su Yin</p>
<p>Qiao wordlessly picked her up, held her close to her heart, and carried her into the house. Mother March brought a cup of soup, followed by Father and Meg. Beth looked at them and smiled slightly. "I want to sleep for a while," she said. Qiao then straightened the cushion under her body and gently put her down. Beth's eyes searched for the light from the window, and a smile appeared in her eyes. "Look," she said, "my birds have just come back." Her head tilted back, and her eyes slowly closed. Qiao cried, "Beth," and called out to Mother March. Meg hugged her father and cried as well.</p>
<p>When Laurie heard the sound of mourning from the March family in Europe, he immediately traveled thousands of miles to Switzerland to find Amy. Amy cried in Laurie's arms. Laurie comforted her, saying that he would not leave her until the wounds in her heart had healed. So he came to accompany Amy to play every day. One day, they were rowing a boat on the lake, and Laurie suddenly stared at her without blinking. How beautiful she was! She had grown up. The coquettish affectations of her childhood had now turned into natural manners. Her golden hair hung beside her rosy cheeks, truly charming, and the sorrows she had suffered over the years had made her character more dignified and solemn. Laurie silently looked at her, and suddenly felt his heart beating as if it had never beaten like that before.</p>
<p>Amy felt his gaze on her. She said, "You must be tired. Let me row for you." Laurie seemed to wake up from a dream and quickly said, "I'm not tired, but if you want to row, we can row together." As dusk fell, a boat rowed slowly far away on the lake, and two dark shadows swayed on the surface of the lake. "Aren't we rowing well?" Amy finally broke the long silence. Laurie said, "Extremely well. I wish we could always be in the same boat, passing the leisurely years together." He put down the oars and softly asked, "Is that okay, Amy?" Amy frowned and said, "But Laurie, haven't you and Qiao always loved each other?" Laurie said, "Yes. I still love her very much. But the love is different now. Amy, that kind of love is childish and cannot last. Qiao used to try to make me understand, but I didn't want to listen to her, and I even got angry at her because of her. But Qiao was right. Amy, things are different now. I am an adult now. You are my sunlight, and I hope you can always shine on me. Amy, is that okay?" Amy's voice was so low that it could not be heard, but there were a few very clear words: "Yes, Laurie." (To be continued)</p>
