<h3 id="c54">抵抗與爭鬭　晦 <a href="#c54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>㈠抵抗之意義</p>
<p>自九一八事變以來。我全國上下無時不言抵抗。無人不言惟抵抗乃能圖存。似我一抵抗即足以使敵人望而生畏。不再前進。我再抵抗則東北失地可復。以往國恥即可消除。是故更進而倡「長期抵抗」之言。以爲如此可以勉勵國人。亦可以稍緩敵方之威脅矣。然而事變迄今一年又四個月。瀋陽之被佔。錦州之失陷。并未收復。其間惟淞滬之役。我雖蒙空前未有之損失。然未嘗屈辱。尚有對等之講和資格。吉黑抗戰。僅餘赤血斑斑之史跡。留待將來之清算耳。</p>
<p>抵抗也者。須敵人來攻。我方抗拒。則主客之勢旣異矣。人爲主動。我爲被動。絕無自力支配之餘地。設使人不來攻。我則老師靡餉。一籌莫展。譬如坐困悉城。内擁飢民。外迫强寇。圖旦夕之苟安。無長久之大計。爲計之失。莫過於此。矧抵抗者純爲一種消極態度。爲保守而非進取。今日之世界。匪特凡百進步。日新月異。各國皆講求加速度之發展。謀國而事保守。恐承平之世。亦不可能。况强敵已入境乎。</p>
<p>㈡現時而言抵抗已屬亡羊補牢</p>
<p>敵方欲蠶食我國。今日據一地。明日割一城。乃借口治安。動曰和平。復號於世界曰。『中國非近代國家。無近代組織』故可以隨意割切也。我若祇言抵抗。旣乏整個的有計劃組織。而僅以地方一部分之力。與敵人全軍相抗。勝敗之數。豈待龜筮。</p>
<p>且東北三省富甲東亞。一朝之間。竟爾坐失。我縱曲意求全。渴望和平，而敵則鐵騎四出。攻城掠地錦州已沒。又失榆關。九門口要塞之地。亦危在旦夕。長此困守。將何以自全。敵方欺我實力薄弱。必將委曲求全。以謀妥協。不知我愈求苟全一時。愈望和平。而敵方則愈加突進。愈肆猛攻。縱任其縱横蹂躪。猶未必能求得和平也。</p>
<p>試以去年十二月二十三日日陸軍當局對我國三中全會所發聲明。非但蔑視國際間之友誼。且盡侮辱之極度。其終結之語曰。『······現下之急務維持遠東和平之第一手段。厥爲清算危險已極之中國國民黨及其外交政策。』斯言也。與「飲馬吳山」之語相較。猶有過之無不及。我其能隱忍到底。僅言抵抗而已耶。</p>
<p>㈢爭鬥之意義</p>
<p>我國積弱。固非一日。然地廣人衆。天賦特厚。設使有積極之領導。轉敗爲勝。自亦不難。敵方國力疲弊。僅以本年度預算二十二億三千萬圓日金觀之。即有不勝擔負之慨。其國債之積累。且至百億日金如再增兵對華。每增兵一師團。至少增加軍費三千萬圓日金。正式對華作戰。假定其出兵一百師團。年费至少在五十萬萬日金以上。以敵方今日之國力。一年之間。即耗其國富二十分之一。縱令其作戰而勝。亦必爲歐戰後之德意志第二無疑。</p>
<p>例之以一二八淞滬戰爭之敎訓。我以劣勢兵力。窳敗器械。尚能與敵相搏至三十二日之久。我如有整個計劃。全體動員。即令國防全無。要塞盡失。出莫大之犠牲。與敵作五年十年之奮戰。則我有餘力。敵且自斃矣。遠之如拿踊崙之侵俄。近之如日軍六個師團这侵西比利亞。俄人不言抵抗。僅有努力奮戰。致敵方挫內而退。乃得鞏因其國基。况今日之勢。所謂公理正義者。必須有强力。乃能貫澈其所說之公理。國際間勢力如不均等。則萬無公理正義可講。蓋公理正義皆隨勢力爲轉移者也。欲圖自國勢力之强大。則非積極爭鬭不可。</p>
<p>㈣爭鬭之前途與現實之認識</p>
<p>日之對我所以敢於得寸進心。繼續侵略不已者。特欺我國民萬無爭鬭精神耳。如我眞能全國動員。亟起一戰。奮民族革命精神。爲百年歷史爭鬭。則西山落日之敵。烏能作持久之戰。亞爾薩斯洛連被割之往事可師。波蘭亡國裂土之仇已復。我有三千四百四十四萬三千餘方里之地積。擁四憶以上之民衆。拚命爭鬭。則東北地域。豈任敵有。</p>
<p>矧日本帝國主義者之露骨侵略。旣惹起資本主義國間之利害衝突。一旦對我作戰。則三億日金之對華輸出。將完全杜絕。二億餘之工業原料輸入。尤受嚴重影響。加以龐大軍費之支出。彼窮乏極之民。其何能堪。</p>
<p>是以今日之中國。欲圖立國生存。萬不宜再事敷衍。作消極無爲之抵抗。長敵人之氣燄。當前之急。尤須對現實有確切之認識。勿過畏敵人之武力。奮力興起。爲舉國必死之爭鬭。惟爭鬭乃能求得生存。惟爭鬭乃能保我民族。現已大難當前。禍近眉睫。忍無可再忍。讓無可再讓。急起爭鬭。方是一條出路。</p>

<p>（四）除講授正課外、如覺時間尚有寬餘、亦可就敎室中、添授補充敎材、但應令學生練習筆記之能力、并整理　正、繳交敎師考核、不宜編成講義、發給學生、</p>
<p>（貳）敎法要點</p>
<p>（一）總論　高中敎材爲初中敎材之第二圓周、故應與前者有切實之聯絡、</p>
<p>㈠高中算學之最先部份、與初中敎材相同、宜多選較困難問題、以資複習、并可由此導入較深之研究、</p>
<p>㈡初中算學注意計算技能之純熟、與基本觀念之了解、研究方法、由實例特例、歸納成爲通則高中則應注重理論方面、用演繹法、作較有系統之研究、以算理之繁深、初中學生自有未能徹底明瞭之處、故初中敎材、高中仍應重提、但詳略不同、輕重異趣、自不至使學征厭倦、并有溫故知新、剥繭抽絲之妙、</p>
<p>㈢高中算學科、僅有二十鐘點、而必授之課程、竟有五六種之多、多　悉皆詳盡、與其敎材過多、　　學生依而化、不如注重基本訓練、養成其自動研究之能力、故立體幾何、高等代數、解析幾何三種、僅需講授大意、但每遇問題有不能徹底搜討時、應提出注意、以啟發學生向上研究之志趣、</p>
<p>（二）代數及高等代數　高中代數應以函數及方程爲中心、</p>
<p>㈠學生於函數觀念、不易明瞭、敎者應於推求初等函數之變値變跡時、加意解釋、以確立其基礎、如二次函數、卽爲最適用之一例、</p>
<p>㈡方程之解法、初中畢業生、已能明瞭、故高中代數、應注重方程通性、同解原理、討論解之變化「含參變數之方程」及增減「例如分數方程、無理方程之根」、二次方程爲方程之入門、最足訓練學生思想、</p>
<p>㈢高等代數、以方程論爲中心、複素數之存在、爲代數基本定量成立之先决條件、行列式爲消去法之利器、級數雖爲極限運算、與代數性質、頗有不同、然一切函數之展式、皆有賴於此、而爲解析學之基礎、故亦宜多加注意、</p>
<p>㈣方程應用問題、不僅限於日常事實、并應與幾何、三角、理化方面、多加聯絡、實際問題、宜注意所得結果之精確程度、高次數字方程之數值解法實際效用頗多、爲習算者所應知、或然率爲統計學核心、亦應講授大意、</p>
<p>（三）幾何　高中幾何、應訓練學生自動探求之能力、并注意邏輯次序、使達於相當之嚴謹程度、</p>
<p>㈠幾何最重羅輯次序、初中學生、年齡幼穉、未易與之嚴守、高中敎授幾何、對此宜加意訓練、但理論嚴謹之程度以學生能感覺其必要且能了解者爲限、</p>
<p>㈡初中已習之定理、宜再用啟發式之解剖、儘量用逆證法、以明思考之途徑、并應就定理間關係、組成系統、顯出幾何全部一貫之線索、庶學生得提綱挈領、增加運用之能力、但所組系統、應從理論上着眼、以利理解、而便記憶、不宜流於板　之分類、</p>
<p>㈢初中未能詳授之部份、應加以補充、并應注意軌跡及作圖題二部分、因此二部份於推理證題之外、尚可發展學生探求發明之能力、</p>
<p>㈣幾何證題及作圖、應就可能範圍内、儘量採用代數方法求已知件與未知未件間之關係、</p>
<p>㈤立體幾何、可僅授大意、以明等間性質及量法爲主、務使學生能透視平面上之圓形、了解各種立體之構造、以與圖畫科中之用器盡相聯絡、</p>
<p>（四）三角　高中三角應以三角函數爲中心、</p>
<p>㈠銳角三角函數及直角三角形解法、旣已於初中習過、故高中卽可從普遍角三角函數入手、以資參較、而宗推廣、此不僅求理論之普遍且爲習物理者所必需之知識、</p>
<p>㈡初中所授三角、以簡易爲主、高中宜注意三角函性質、三角恒等式、方程式等（均宜與代數方面相當問題比較）、以供進修高等算學時之用、</p>
<p>（五）解析幾何　高中解析幾何、應融匯代數、幾何、三角諸學程示其相互爲用之處、一面作中學階段算學科之一總結束、一面立高深研究之基礎、</p>
<p>㈠解析幾何、應與代數、幾何、三角互相聯絡、以解决幾何問題、而充分表示算學各部份呼應一氣之性質、</p>
<p>㈡欲圖形與數量、得相應之關聯、不得不用推廣之幾何元素、故解析幾何遂不能不與綜合幾何互有出入（如分角總求法之問題）、凡此等處、最宜使初學者注意、以期其見解明晰、無所惶惑、</p>
<p>㈢綜合法作圖之範圍、非解析莫能决、如有充分時間、宜　示作圖不能（Ｌmpooodlecongtruction）</p>

<p>— 尤懷臯</p>
<p>在這二十世紀科學昌明的時期、任何人不應當反對現政府的建設政策、但是我的主張、要請政府不要忘記在敎育上建設要比在物質上建設爲重要、因爲在國内大部份人民、未有受敎育以前、百份之九十九的建設、仍舊是竹籬茅舍、小舟小車、簡具陋器、布衣布土鞋、全民衆中、至多不過萬分之一的人物、在科學上建設、結果是滄海一粟、無濟於事、雖奖費盡心機、所成有限、若能同時在敎育上力行建設、就能使數萬萬民衆增高知識、改變思想、然後大部份的人民、都能照二十世紀的標準、協助政府來建設、這種建設、是無窮盡的、是具普遍性的、是實在的、是偉大的、所失去的信用、再拿敎育來佈施於大衆的人民、要比拿金銀財帛來救濟、好到千萬倍、因爲金銀就要用完、那知識的富源、不但終身用之不盡、并可傳諸子孫、所以政府眞肯發這敎育役的命令來施敎於人民、足以救人民於水深火熱的當中、這就是需家的仁、佛家的慈、與耶敎的愛、所以我們不必向外國舉金銀貨物的僓、吸須向全國大中學的腦庫中、取智慧的種子來散佈在萬萬千千民衆的腦田中、十年後的收成、將多至不可勝數、</p>
<p>我們的政府、倘然能建立在信與愛的上面、他的基礎、可以使水不能浸、火不能伐、有泰山那般地穩固、有鐵石那般的堅硬、他的壽命、可以與天地同休、宇宙同命、這就是我切望於現政府者、</p>
<p>在人民方面、無論是知識階級、資產階級、或農工階級、應當一心一意的擁護現政府、拿誠意來相見、實行規勸忠告、廢除笑駡陰謀、國難期中、聰明的人、應當盡知力、有錢的人盡財力、有力的人盡體力、這才是國民對國家與政府應有的表示、</p>
<p>所以我很希望政府拿「信」字來對上等人民、拿「愛」字來對次等人民、我又希望人民拿「誠」字來對政府、拿「力」字對國家、這乃是敎育救國的一個先决條件、</p>
<h3 id="c166">（十八）亡國的蠅蛾與有救國的蜂蝶 <a href="#c166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>飛蛾的撲火、大家要笑他愚、蒼蠅的逐臭、大家又要說他貪、但是我們終日終夜醉生夢死、在這聲色貨利的上海過日子、難道就不是飛蛾撲火的行爲麽、還有一班人、夜以繼日、做這欺騙刼奪陰謀殺害的事跡、難道不就是蒼蠅逐臭的勾當麽、雖說人各有死、但是要死得其時、何必一定要學這飛蛾的撲火而死、雖說人各謀生、但也要謀得正當、又何必一定要學這蒼蠅的逐臭而生、</p>
<p>我們先拿一個蜜蜂與蒼蠅來比較一下、就可以明白這個道理、你看一個小小的蜜蜂、　　分工他能合羣、他愛陽光、也喜工作、他能勤儉、他知儲蓄、他且能未雨綢繆、他的蜜是從勤儉中得來、是拿散佈花粉工作的代價中得來、蒼蠅的體格、在形式上似乎與蜜蜂差不多、但是在精神上一比、就有賢不肖的分别了、</p>
<p>我們再拿一個蝴蝶來與飛蛾比較一下、這個道理可以更進一層的明白、你看那蝴蝶是愛好天然、飛舞於柳綠花明之間、一樣一個虫、那蛾的一種、至死不變的沉溺態度、却與蝶的一種清超優游的態度、絕然不同、所以蝶可以盡其歲月、而畢其生、蛾則盡亡、所以而促其亡、這就是智愚的分别了、</p>
<p>我認定諸君是救國的蜂蝶、不是亡國的蠅蛾、所以千萬不要忘記了我們偉大的工作釀蜜、天給我們極大的當源、來養我們衆多的民族、他要我們用人工的腦力體力羣力機力時力、來取這天然的日力地力水力電力氣力、方始可以培養富力來製造幸福、所以我們然是救國的蜂蝶、那末這都市中决不是我們實施工作的地方長久的、學這蠅蛾的行爲、至少要變成蠅蛾式的蜂蝶了、這是最可痛最危険的一件事、要請諸君極端的注意、</p>
<p>我們數百萬方里的土地、是我日力與地力最富的地方、　已耕的田、加以物種的改良、拿未耕（田、加以開闢、拿未開的礦、加以開取、這才算取得日力與地力、黃河流域長江流域與珠江流域、是我水力與電力、最富的地方、拿他來造電灌溉航運養物、才算取得水力與電力、運用化學的方法、及機器的效用、廣事製造、才算取得氣力、</p>
<p>消滅這大塊的字盲與文盲、用少數的智者來敎這大多數的無知者、這才算用腦力、節省體力、給大部份農工階　級、以適當的娱樂與休養、這才算用體力、有週密的組織、有合羣的美德、這才算用羣力、廣用機器、愛護機器、這才算用機力、惰者要愛惜光陰、不可太逸、勤都也要節用時間、不可過勞、并且要改良制度、看要時光、這才算用時力、</p>
<p>所以、諸君應當明白諸君對於國家的責任、何等的重大、事務又何等的繁重、在此國難時期、决不能容留無無數有用的蜂蝶、在這都市中效學這貪愚的蠅蛾做些輕薄淺　的工作、就算了事、所以諸君若要救國、必定要决决絕絕的離開上海、向内地鄕村去做這敎育救國的工作、</p>
<p>蠅蛾蜂蝶的比較</p>
<p>蠅　蜂　蛾　蝶</p>
<p>與取貧富圖</p>
<p>取的力　人工之力　群力　　力　体力　機力　時力物力　富力　電力　地力　日力　水力　氣力　天然之力供人類的應用幸福</p>

<p>（回起五兩二錢）昨據外電、倫敦大條近遠俱長一二五，美銀升二五、英美美英兩匯兌俱高半分及三七五、遠期銀市漲起四厘、美棉㣲增五六磅音、是以開盤平平、爲七百九十八兩八錢、銀行匯市開盤亦平、計近期英匯出價一先令八便士零六二五、美匯念八元、開後趨緊、塲内前日售者俱來追進、抬至八百零五兩、乃因匯豐掛牌仍續放長、計先令增一二一、美金加二五、人心聂挫、遂見下游愤加之美國有購買二萬五千萬銀盎司作輔幣之準備、</p>
<p>據路透社一月九日紐约電、今日參議員蒂爾（華盛頓）提出一發行銀兌換券之議案、該項銀兌換券、須財部準備購進銀二五○·○○○、○○○元、此項兌換券、可合法照付各種債欵、此項銀兩在市塲買進、最多每兩一元二角半爲限、</p>
<p>乃大德成等售條、遂跌爲七百九十六兩半、銀行胃口尚佳、中央銀行屢思開現、價遂重至八百兩外、恒興福餘等略進、重轉穩勢、條額乾涸、各號亦無巨量交易、價乃徘徊、人心不定、市况亦遂恍惚、後市先趨高勢、至零五兩二錢、後孟買報升、又轉下游、交易仍極散漫、雖跌至零一兩、但匯市依然未曾轉硬、恒興稍納、又見三兩、起仆多次、最後仍以零三兩六錢收盤、綜觀全日間金市無聊、匯市麻木、人心極形不定、惟趨勢似穩中央銀行屢思下手、但終以價格不合、而少成交、大致祇開五六百條之數、（蓋金價恍惚各號均不易代手）今將一日間市况分誌於左、</p>
<h3 id="c191">晨市進退於八百兩内外 <a href="#c191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>晨開跳高半兩、爲七百九十八兩八錢、物品稍形套出、降至八兩一錢、美豐進本月份美金念八元、匯市似佳、塲内慶發永昌升永恒餘遂來購條、穿出八百兩、二月份美金零六二五不易得手、人心看好、源茂永元亨恒餘福餘志豐永競趨買進、好至八百零四兩光景、而恒興忽來代客進條、一般散户亦皆補空、抬至零五兩、然因條額不多、立見回降、但尚可支持、及後預悉掛牌仍長、加之路透電告、美國有購買二萬餘萬銀盎司作爲輔幣之動機、大興永義豐永出條、價遂見小、但此際尚有數度盤旋、及到匯豐掛牌揭曉英加一二五、美加二五、匯市因反趨鬆面、美豐出正月份美金零六二五、（下半月）掮客都來賣出、大德成乾昌祥宏利及物品猛售、遂跌至八百兩關内、三月美金一二五可結、遂降爲九十六兩五錢、各號並不見湧、是以不致續小、但匯市極拙、此後三月份美金一八七五俱要、恒餘先來略進、乾昌祥大德成亦來購買、同業以爲中央又來開現矣、價遂抬至九兩光景、志豐永納進、漲至八百兩出、一二五可進、故雖漲至零二兩一錢後、市况卽平、不有再升、交易亦少、遂在一二兩之間、由散户及物品來互相抬壓、後由志豐永脫手、又打破八百兩大關、而至九十九兩、市况又見無聊者久之、大德成又來進條、羣疑又係代中央者、故升至零一兩、但應手者不多、福餘大德成恒興續購不已、正金吃正月九三七五、恒餘亦附和而進、抬至零四兩外、無如人心飄搖、天豐永兆豐昌見高價而售、又降爲零二兩二錢、此時已近收市、續因散户抵補、而升數錢、最後爲零二兩五錢收盤、物品拍零二兩八錢、</p>
<h3 id="c192">後市陷入無聊狀態中 <a href="#c192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>午後開盤遂爲八百零二兩八錢、徘徊於二兩三兩之間、蓋因大户觀望、而抬面愈乾、及至二月份美金二十八元銀行要進、福餘遂納、漲爲四兩光景、義豐永隨之而進、卽至零五兩二錢、孟買電告漲三安那、兆豐昌首出、慶發永恒餘亦售、降至三兩光景、六二五三月美金可結、志豐永　售、兆豐昌恒餘賣意未息、漸跌至零一兩、但匯市麻木、並未稍鬆、四月份一二五雖不易出、但一八七五却多買户、恒興屢次進條、但數目不多、故價雖連升、而多盤旋、宏利等亦購、漲至四兩外、大德成代客則出、降至零三兩内、平靜者多時、後因恒興大德成爭相購條、塲内又起中央開現之訊、升至四兩外、物品及散户每待其額滿後而售、是以屢見所掙於四兩内外、最後由慶發永壓價、而到三兩光景、但以時屆收盤、買賣兩方俱不興奮、遂在無聊之中以八百零三兩五錢收盤、物品拍零三兩七錢、查全日最高價八百零五兩二錢、最低價七百九十六兩五錢、有入兩七錢差度、結果則較前收漲起五兩二錢、</p>

<p>▲晨開一度趨硬··全市有一二五上落</p>
<p>昨市匯兌與金市同趨恍惚而帶麻木、初因大條電告升上一二五、美銀漲起二五、匯兌亦略大、遠期銀價則高四厘、銀行私電亦加三一二五、是以英匯出近期一先令八便士○六二五、美匯念八元、較前收英匯略硬、美匯則平、開後因稍有補空、故緊勢、標金亦漲、匯市更佳、外電報告美國擬購銀盎司之訊來、立予打擊、匯豐掛牌亦英長一二五、美大二五、漸趨硬面、入後又形回頭、最後則殊平和、趨勢不定、交易亦未見熱鬧、金業中上午塞而下午略扒、美豐仍績出美金、沙遜塞英金、此外銀行扒塞時見、全市有一二五光景上落、一日結果、英匯稍緊○六二五、美匯亦然、</p>

<p>昨（十日）華商證劵交易所債劵市面、以局勢仍險恶市上多謠、人心不定、價暴漲暴落、升降極烈、方於晨初開拍時、市面尚虚弱、旋因傳榆案有進行解决之說、致買氣漸見熱鬧、各價愈漲愈勁、午市前後兩盤爲其最堅俏時期、最高價比晨初大一大元數角至二元六七角不等、較前日亦飛漲一元至二元半元之鉅、市面情况、一時殊佳、但在收市一盤、市又一蹶不振、以傳北方局勢緊張如前、榆案和平無望、遂致賣出交易忽暢、買方束手不動、猛降八九角至一元半、而一九關善則飛跌一元七八角之鉅、市面之混亂情形、實邇所未有也、結果較前仍均續漲、然除關稅獨漲二元數角、整六期貨及二○捲一月均約大一元外、其他僅好半元左右、察邇來之環象形勢、市面實　險惡、前途波瀾正多、一時殊未許過子樂觀也、全日期市交易甚旺、成交達一千四百七十餘萬元、惟現貨交易仍祇六千元、</p>

<p>（滬西）昨日南市來源一二十號、市上零胃見</p>

<p>（閘北）昨日河下到船稀少、白粳囤户總辦、店胃洛潑、市情陡漲二三角、早薄稻來源績有、天津包胃稍化、零交平平、市面薄　定勢、早稻緊起數分、杜尖到貨無幾、零銷績化、價加一角、竿埠尖到銷兩平、市帶緊象、白元到貨不多、銷路頗活、價提昂近尺、陰元到少銷暢、價又緊象、</p>

<p>昨客秈去化、北帮又淡、因有薄稻一批裝出、對於客秈胃口、略爲停頓、但照業中人與該帮中人意見、此後天津及直魯沿海各埠對於客秈交易、當有繼續辦裝之必要、但有河下杜粳之軋脚、辦數有限、大約在陰暦年底以前必有大批過年貨之辦存、近日零星交易、日有應酬、昨北銷雖淡、然有南帮繼起、閩帮胃口本暢、因被杜米轉口及北帮問津、乃暫時停頓、昨北銷一淡、立卽搜辦、北帮仍應酬湖南機油二百包、閩泉州帮則去湘油二百六十三包、機紅米六百廿四包、江西機晚二百八十包、機紅米存到兩少、獨漲角外、價開九元及八元九角半、機晚湘油各漲近角、機晚九元一角三分、湖南機油米九元一角二分至零五分　　黃豆市仍疲弱、銷胃稍有問津、往後如無大批去胃、一時雖以轉機、廠家辦去大連豆三車、廣帮辦去浦東杜豆七百餘包、崇明沙黃及宿州黃豆四百包、由本街辦去、正陶關黃豆二十噸、亦由廠家辦去、大連紅糧内地帮採辦一百包、九江牛奶蔴三十包、廣帮問津、花生共成交四百六十餘包、本街去胃、油市各路銷塲清淡、惟本街尚有囤進、市呈平凡、</p>

<p>昨日糖市趨勢堅穩、公會劃盤二四粗砂白劃十五兩九錢半、高貨十六兩零五分、荷赤轉昂、八九號劃至十二兩六錢半、比前升起錢許、新潮靑以來價難劃、號貨一致扳守、故昨市開價轉升二錢、成交千餘包、高貨爲九兩次至八兩半、四都靑貨次七兩四錢、　湖赤爲數不多、尤爲緊俏、比前亦升二錢、開出二百餘件、價爲十二兩三錢至二錢、聞潮靑後批運貨不日可以續到、但無轉鬆希望、</p>

<p>白桐油自漢口開襄桐十三兩客盤後、行家卽批十二兩八錢洋例紋、嗣曾一度見好、加起二錢、旋又回落、洋莊油仍開十七兩五錢洋規、而交易不多、仍祇數十百噸而已、市面跌至此已、當然無再跌之虞、然欲望好、一時亦不可能、故漢市雖穩、而轉機似尚非其畤、至於浙桐市面縱略有俏疲、亦祇三四角上落、聞現市足度貨售開每砠二十二元江交、售者因有成本關係、似非所願而購者亦不足爲奇、取舍兩無所貪、蓋因市能暴漲猛跌、庶可引人入勝、而乃輾轉盤旋、久乏蹊景、致不能使人注意也、</p>

<p>英白鐵以定價步高、到貨枯鮮、致標準又陡起漲風、昨復以掮客及囤户收羅、市風更俏、現市如七尺每張可開至一兩○五分、六尺八錢五分二十八號十二兩五錢、二十六號十一兩七錢半、二十四號十一兩五錢、市上成交共有八九百担之多、但底貨自經大辦後、益覺寥寥、</p>

<p>— 廋鵑</p>
<p>自木屐兒的鐵騎，踏上碎了東北三省，忽忽已一年多了。全中國的百萬雄師，除了十九路軍第五軍，和榆關駐軍外，竟令人有「更無一箇是男兒」之慨。幸而有誓死抗日的義勇軍，呑氷嚼雪的在那裏和敵人作戰，掙扎了一年多，愛國健兒的爲國犠牲者，正不知有幾百千人，連他們的姓名都不曾知道，我們這班後死之人，要安慰那些無名英雄的英魂，竟也不知從那裏說起！昨在舊鈔本中發見故詩人蔣觀雲（智由）先生「挽古今之敢死者」一詩，亟錄若干紙，哭向東北，稽首焚化，英魂有知，定將許爲知言富貴，君子不偷生，一笑看屠刀，屠刀芒且平，轉瞬塗路間，血肉醃泥塵，終勝困胡水源作</p>
<p>牀褥，酸吟多苦辛。（其一）磨刀復磨刀。持以殺豕羊，磨刀復磨刀，英雄多此亡，羊豕與英雄，豈不兩分將，羊豕供啖食，人間足蒸嘗，英雄爲犠牲，衆生福穰穰。（其二）男兒抱熱血，百年待一灑，一灑夫何處？靑山與靑史，靑山生光彩，煌煌前朝事，靑史生光彩，飛揚令人起，後日馨香人，當日屠醘子，屠醘時一笑，一笑寗計此？（其三）焉亦飽我肉，蟻亦飽我脂，犬亦舐我血，蟲亦穿我骴，吾聞佛家言，以身爲布施，於物苟有益，狼藉奚足辭？（其四）藁薦爲斂衾，斧鉞爲含玉，人生貴英靈，不足實福殼，君看英雄人，意氣猶在目，多少厚葬者，歲久化石骨，石骨有時盡，英名無時落。（其五）獄吏與屠卒，對我意何尊？逡巡視含目，有若繞兒孫，爾輩亦何爲？未未足置一言，是非與功罪，付與萬古論。（其六）牛有時伏軛，螂有時當車，牛身非不大，泥淖徒軒渠，螂身非不小，氣若呑有餘，爲國重民氣，强弱從此殊，彼爭自由死，寗肯生爲奴？（其七）病死最不幸，吾昔爲此語，腐儒列五福，考終世所與，儒者重明哲，後人若晝鼠，君子養浩然，明神依大宇，强釋生死名，生死夫來爾。（其八）</p>
<h3 id="c256">宰予晝寢丨論語新解丨 <a href="#c256" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e256" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">256</a></h3>
<p>— 程魯丁</p>
<p>宰予這個人，我不敢說他是怎樣的濫汚，我不願說他是怎樣的用功，但我也不承認孔子的話，就是大道理，至少，宰予也有他的門檻的，不是麽？他却是一位摩登的大學生。</p>
<p>不然，爲什麽要晝寢呢？雖然，晝寢並不是罪過的事，但是，好好的白天，倒是快樂的時候，正宜於到女生寄宿舍去做狗兒爬，正家於到同學房間裏吹得牛皮飛，爲什麽要睡？有什麽好睡？甚至，連半點氣息也沒有，這樣，究竟爲了什麽呢？</p>
<p>爲了救國，枕戈待旦嗎，爲了抗敵，以夜作晝嗎？據我想，並不是這樣，縱然是這樣，就是這樣好了，至少也與讀書無關。</p>
<p>其次就是，跳舞塲，遊藝塲，或者乃是什麽安樂窩，再不然，就是什麽大飯店。</p>
<p>實在呢，與其說是救國與抗敵而晝寢，倒不如說「救國不忘娱樂抗敵不忘娱樂」而晝寢倒還確實點，倒還妥當些。</p>
<p>可見晝寢的事，在大學生史上，已是「自古已然」，當然「於今爲烈」，無怪乎現在的一般大學生，今天戀愛，明日挾妓，原來是有本之談。</p>

<p>— 瘦鵑</p>
<p>這種虚幻的影片，有幾幕非常清晰；有幾幕似乎已有些糢糊。不過儘舊的事，儘小的事，絕不漏去一點。這是他五年前的經歷的往事，也可以說是五年前的一塲噩夢。</p>
<p>第一幕，在他腦膜上演映的；是一個陰森可怕的雪夜。那天晚上空氣比鐵還冷；比刀還利，直逼得星兒月兒，一齊怯怯地躱藏起來。鵝掌大的雪花，受了西北風的鼓勵，結成大隊，歷亂的在空中跳無。樹頭的枯枝敗葉，在殘酷的風陣中，勉力掙扎，一陣陣發爲悽厲的呻吟。自然界裏。一片黑暗，偶然借着積雪的𢌞光，遠望一樹一屋，都�</p>
<p>現出猙獰这狀，宛如許多野獸，蹲踞在路旁，張牙舞爪，預備攫人而噬。</p>
<p>那時：他捱着冷；冒着雪；迎着利箭似的風，帶喘；帶抖；又帶着慌急，在一片荒凉而廣漠的原野上奔趕。他一口氣奔了十多里路，始終不見一個人影。有好幾次。他幾乎被那狂大的風塊，打得秀不過氣來。他那滿身沾着的雪花，若使變成米粉，非但可以療治此刻的饑餓，並也儘夠儲爲幾天的糧食。他的衣服與身子，差不多要氷成三整塊。可是身子越冷。心裏越急，越覺這廣漠的原野，比往日經過時，格外的遙遠。他在略略住步換氣的時候，祇聽得遠處偶有一兩聲的犬吠，雜在怒吼似的風聲中，隱隱約約浮到耳邊。這種犬吠聲，似也耐不住這奇冷，因此分外的悽銳而緊促，直等於病人臨終時最後的慘呼。聽了之後，使他全身的血液，幾乎立時要凝爲务凍。</p>
<p>原來這一次，他因爲不容於黑暗的家庭，不容於殘酷的後母；所以他齩齩牙，寗可衝着黑暗的荒野；殘酷的風雪，冒死去投奔他的摯友東方生。</p>
<p>歐陽物把五年前的往事回憶到這裏；一時自覺有一縷冷氣，從心坎裏直冒出來，籠罩滿了全身，彷彿又置身於當年的冰天雪陣中。（二）</p>

<h3 id="c261">天冷的時候爲甚麽發抖 <a href="#c261" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e261" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">261</a></h3>
<p>— 氷玉</p>
<p>小弟弟，小妹妹，我們的身體，不可以過於冷；也不可以過於熱的。倘若過於冷，就覺到要發抖了。因爲我們的腦中，有很　敏注意冷熱的神經，身體的溫度，受外面的冷氣影響驟然低降時，那神經立刻向各方的筋肉，發出收縮的命令來。筋肉一縮，就表現發抖的樣子，所以發抖，就是筋肉收縮的緣故。</p>
<p>我們在寒冷的天，把全身的筋肉運動一下，就能生熱，譬如呆立在風雪的地方，必定越立越冷，倘若把身體四肢，上下左右，運動數分鐘，那末，各方面的筋肉，漸漸的緊張，全身覺到溫暖了。</p>

<p>李浦曼，是一個很窮苦的少年。有一天出門去旅行，忘記帶了橡皮，而旅行的日記，是要寫的。他在途中用鉛筆寫日記時，常常寫錯，可是沒有橡皮，可以擦去，心中感到很不便。他靜靜一想，倘把鉛筆與橡皮，合做在一塊，自然可以避去這麽煩了。歸家之後，就發明了鉛筆的筆端裝以橡皮的一法。現在我們所用的「橡皮頭鉛筆」，就是這少年想出求的。</p>
<p>還有一位華爾太漢德，他穿了斗篷上山去去到半路，斗篷的紐扣，忽然失去了。然而路上風勢很大，他一面走；一面想，想出一個替代紐扣的方法來。他取出一根鐵絲，彎彎曲曲的，做成一支别針，後來卽以此爲動機，發明安全别針。</p>

<p>— 方三</p>
<p>「誰要孩子，賣孩子」！一種悲哀而高亢的聲音，由衖堂裏送進我的房間。</p>
<p>這是世界最悽慘的聲音罷！也就是世界上最悲憤的聲音罷！</p>
<p>接着一聲二聲，高高低低地：「誰要孩子，賣孩子」！在冷風裏如像受了重創的野獸一樣的哀呌·</p>
<p>我推開窗子看：在水門汀上坐着一個婦人，用破衣裹着一個小孩。他的母親如像怕他受寒，又像怕他被人搶去，緊緊地將他抱在懹裏。</p>
<p>女人旁邊站着一個三十多歲的男子，大約就是她的男人，孩子的父親；也就是喊「誰要孩子，賣孩子」的人。他低着頭，滿面浮着悲悉和羞憤。</p>
<p>他們前面圍着五六個女人，在那裏議論長短。「這不是一個　　子」！北方人的口音，從那個　髮，穿旗袍的女人口中吐出的。另有一個女人，大約有四十來歲的樣子，穿着中國的　裝，但頭髮很光，梳着牛　似的髻。她向那賣孩子的人說：</p>
<p>「你會寫字麽？」聽到這句話，我以爲她發了「善」心，想替他介紹職業。但，接着，她又說：「你寫個字，我給你三四塊錢，把那個小孩子賣給我罷」。</p>
<p>賣孩子的漢子肯定的回答道：</p>
<p>「不會，你要你抱去好了，只要給我幾塊錢。」</p>
<p>「不會寫字出好，只要你便畫十字」。她又說。</p>
<p>男子在猶豫，抱孩子的女人在哭泣，悲哀在痛囓着一對窮父母的心。</p>
<p>「會寫字不會寫，都沒多大關係。拿幾塊錢來，孩子就抱去吧。」很久很久，那男人才這樣地回答：</p>
<p>男一個女人，將那想買孩子的女人一拉，悄悄地向她耳朶裏咕　了幾句。並且現出得意的神色：「不寫字是不成功的呀·」</p>
<p>那個買孩子的婦人說：「只要你畫個十字，我多給你幾塊錢都可以。丨你知道我把孩子買去，還要給他請奶媽，給他做衣裳······」她顯着誇耀的神氣。</p>
<p>抱孩子的女人聽到這幾句話，更悲哀的哭出聲來。頭低到小孩的頭上，臉襯着小孩的臉。斷斷續續地說：</p>
<p>「天呀！小寳寳，你······你；眞的要被我賣了？在鄕下吃不飽飯，以爲到上海可以有飯吃，誰知道千辛萬苦到上海來，仍是餓···餓···餓肚子。你爸爸要把你賣了當飯吃呀！天，我們窮人便連個孩子都不准有嗎？賣···賣···賣孩子·····」後面的聲音在悲憤中聽峭到了。</p>
<p>他的男人，將頭一昂，臉上的顏色更慘白得可怕；但眼光裏噴出的，很顯然的是憤恨之火。他大聲的說：</p>
<p>「我們還要　　我們難道坐着等待餓死不成？天，我們已經窮到賣孩子了，我們連到一個孩子也不准有了！但，我們總得想法子活下去！窮人總得想法子活下去呵·」</p>
<p>看熱鬧的幾個女人，見到這種瘋子樣的情形，大家投着鄙視的眼，跳着笑着一窠蜂似的走了；買孩子的女人，也將手一揷，冷笑了一聲，悠然地回家了。</p>
<p>刀子似的冷風仍在空中咆哮，吹過了馬路，吹過了曠野，却吹不進高大的洋房。賣孩子的父母帶着他們的陔子，在馬路上，曠野上　躅着，呌着，我恍惚聽到他一直呌到東方發白。</p>
<h3 id="c267">拿事實來 <a href="#c267" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e267" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">267</a></h3>
<p>— 楊幸之</p>
<p>直到現在，我們的張學良將軍總算咬緊牙關說出了一句「對日暴行，只有血肉一拚，維持正義只有熱血」，的「硬」話。（見一月九日一報）雖說這還不過只是一句「話」，但究竟比那老是「鎭靜着，」無事做就打考爾夫聽京劇的態度是「好得多」。</p>
<p>不過，已經是一年又四個月了、從九一八禍變爆發到目前。我們聽慣了「長期抵抗」的誓言，也聽慣了「有準備」，「有計劃」「有决心」的昭示，更讀慣了「政府决不負人民·········」等等的文告。我們被這樣的「誓言」和「文告」欺騙愚弄已經一年又四個月了，現在我們所需要的是事實，是挺起身子的硬幹，是「眞」的拿血和肉來抵抗日本的暴行的實際行動。我們再不需要朦人眼目的烟幕彈，再不需要不兌現的支票。</p>
<p>從瀋陽退到錦州，再從錦州退到山海關，現在，山海關上桑飄揚着血紅的太陽旗了！就令你還可以退，但你退一步，他進一步，一年來的事實，嶄然如鐵，你退，究竟何處是你「退」的「最後」？</p>
<p>「以自力謀自衞自救」，「反抗日本帝國主義者的侵略暴行」，這是「天經地義」。只要你肯「反抗」，你肯「自衛」，民衆决不會使你孤軍奮鬥的，馬占山蔡廷鍇蘇炳文諸部便是眼前的榜樣。</p>
<p>旣不戰，又不守，敵人來了，便拚命退，就是這樣馬馬虎虎的將國土一塊一塊的送掉，讓太陽旗插上了瀋陽城，插上了長白山，現在又揷上了山海關頭，或者再進一步揷上·········「誤國者誰」？人民是終於會起來算賬的！</p>
<p>所以，張將軍不必空口說「血和肉，」只須拿事實來，只須眞的拿血和肉到山海關前去拚！</p>

<p>德皇（Ｋaiser）喜歡自已設計宫殿，城堡，敎堂，以及兵船等。在　十年代，當他訪問意大利的時候，　和意大利的海軍大臣白林上將結　了。白林上將那時在歐洲是被視爲一個最多才的造艦專家的。德皇向白林上將說、他可以送一張建造戰鬥艦的圖樣給他，那圖樣是他自已費盡心血計劃出來的，是一種長時間的研究，不倦的勤奮與思索的收獲。</p>
<p>幾星期之後，白林收到了德皇寄來的那張圖樣。他看了之後，便將它連同下面的一封信寄還德皇。</p>
<p>「陛下設計的兵艦，眞是一隻世界上所未見的最有能力，最可怕而又最可愛的戰鬥艦。它的速率，定能造成空前的紀綠，它的鐵甲，能超越一切今日飛駛於水上的兵艦，它的桅柱，會成爲世界上最高的，它的砲定會制勝世界上無論是那一隻兵艦。而且那内部的設備是裝置得那末全美，使全體的船員，上自艦長，下至艙役，會以能在這隻艦上面駕駛爲樂事。這隻可驚嘆的兵艦，祇有一種缺點：倘使它被放到水上面去，它會有如塊鉛一般的沉下去的。」</p>

<p>她立在海泉的房門首，想就推門進去。但又躊躇起來。海泉的房門在裏而從來是不加鎖的。她輕輕敲了一下門罪，不見裏面答應。她禁不住伸手去推門，門罪便　的開了。海泉房裏的電燈沒有熄，但海泉果然睡着了。他的被窩深深地蓋着他的颔下。</p>

<p>— 天放</p>
<p>丨丨一個嚴重的農村問題丨丨</p>
<p>去冬國内大稔，收成在十二成以上，但因去年的大水，以及洋米洋麥的侵入，商人的操縱市塲，米價因以慘落，在肈煮家鄕丨丨浙西嘉屬一帶，最近米價每石只五元餘，照最好的收成，每畝三石計算，也祇賣到十五六元，以三分之一還租，餘下來的償人工肥料還不夠，那裏有餘錢來供妻兒添衣製服，但米價雖低，而農民丨丨尤其是中國的農民除了穀物之外還有什麽是財產呢？所以大部份急用的農民都不得不忍痛把一年勞作得來的穀物　去，等到在農村裏不能生存時就到都市裏來做工業候補者，這樣農村經濟更形衰落，社會的下層基礎。已漸呈動搖，這崩潰的情形，正歷年而愈著，</p>
<p>『以農立國』這口號，在中國已唱四五千年，但到近年這老調再不能唱了。　因爲農業國，而外國食糧的輸入，平均的約一萬萬元。這豈非笑話。所以『以農立國』的老招牌。現在不得不辭下了。但舊招牌旣已辭下。新招牌還未掛起。倘有人間我們現在『立國』的基礎靠什麽。那末，只好說『靠天』立國。因爲舊有的農村自給經濟，旣已破壞無餘，而新的工商業丨丨民族資本，又厄於外國資本的壓迫，萬難抬頭，現在中國的經濟組織，農村成爲都市工商業的尾巴，而孝市工商業，又成爲外國資本主義的尾巴，生產的方式，在我們現在尾巴，都不完全，我們只在夾縫中喘息着，而找不到一個出路，但這嚴重的問題，終不能漠然放過，中國的農民數，據民國十六年武漢中央土地委員會的調查，有三萬三千六百萬，佔全人口百分之八十四，這鉅量的農民，多數是已失了憑藉，又不能往都市裏跑，丨丨都市也正遭着同樣的命運，但生存是人類第一個欲望，终不成盡作餓莩，這裏農民的兩條出路。是做『土匪』與『當兵』</p>
<p>做土匪還得自籌傢伙而危險性也大，最後一條路，多數是當兵，</p>
<p>中國是以兵多出名的國家，但在『好男不當兵』的社會裏，這二百餘萬的健兒，究從那裏來的呢？則可回答一句。都是農村裏被迫出來的剩餘人口。</p>
<p>我們再從民變兵後來看是怎樣的一個情形，</p>
<p>論理，兵的責任，該是『衛國』『安民』，不會有其他的定義吧，但在中國一切都是例外，外國人看中國的武裝同志，只是不厭不倦的自相殘殺，似乎术神秘，太滑稽了，但這正是中國兵的特質，因爲窮極而當兵。所以有有給以衣食的。便是恩主至於『人民』『國家』等觀念。在兵士的腦筋中是影子都沒有的。這也莫怪在未當兵之前，生活極度的低落，當兵後，生活極度的放縱，於是造成了一種特殊的人生觀。就是迷信『武力萬能』。穿上了老虎皮。誰敢說個『不』字。</p>

<h3 id="c274">怎樣計算我們的電燈費 <a href="#c274" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e274" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">274</a></h3>
<p>— 學海</p>
<p>大概在上海當過三房客的人，總經騐到二房東太太對於租户電燈開閉的注意，和用電多少的嚕囌吧？我們常是聽到二房東太太因房客僅出了一元或兩元錢的電費，而一盞十六支光的燈，每天要點到十二點鐘，咕嚕着這些電的消耗，而僅出這些代價是示夠的。至於房客呢，則認所出的電費，已掉乎有餘了；於是雙方起了無謂的爭執。其實在三房東方面，確出沒有方法估計房客每月電量的消耗，究有多少；而三房客呢，也無方法可以來證明或解釋他自已所耗電量爲若干。各人憑了各人的私見來說話，試問怎能夠排除糾紛呢？現在我將電燈費簡易算法寫一些出來，使普通家庭中，對於每月的電費、有一種豫算；而且也可免去許多房東房客的糾紛呢。</p>
<p>現在我們所用的燈，其光力的大小，有以「瓦特」計算的，也有以「燭光」連算的。如電泡上有４０Ｗ，便是四十瓦特；或３２ＣＰ，則是三十二支燭光了。近來電泡大都用瓦特計算，而不以燭光　　　　　瓦特單位易於計算的緣故。現爲明瞭起見，先抄一張表在下面，以便對照？</p>
<p>瓦特數７５１４５１８２５　２５　４０　６０１００　１５０２５０</p>
<p>燭光數５　１０　１６　１８８３１３４８８８７０１３４０２２７０</p>
<p>我們知道，每小時用一千個瓦特電量，則電表上走一個字。現在我們假設某房客用一盞十六支光燈，我們在上面表上，就查得出一盞十六支光合一八·二五的瓦特數，假如第天大概六點鐘起開燈，到十二時息燈，平均用六小時，則一個月的電費，照以下的公式就可算出來了。</p>
<p>３０×６×１８．２５＼１０００＝３２８５／１０００＝３．２８５ＫＷＨ</p>
<p>這三·二八五就是電表上的字數，每字以銀二角計算，每月也不到八角呀丨如我們再換一只四十瓦特的燈泡計算，則也可照下式：</p>
<p>３０×６×４０／１０００　７２００／１０００＝７．２ＳＷＨ</p>
<p>結算是七個字零，每月電費也不過一元四角四分而已。</p>
<p>我們有了這個算的方式，如果燈點得多，也可依此類推，每月對於電費的一層，當不至漫無把握了吧？</p>

<p>— 賓符</p>
<p>新年已經過去了，人們渴望了好久的大赦似的幾天例假也偷偷地溜過去了。現在又要抖起了粗神把放弛的神經重新拉緊起來，　的回到寫字台前來，有的回到櫃窗台前來。</p>
<p>休息似乎於人們是很有緣的，休息了好幾天以後來做工作的人，似乎還是在「感慨係之」地惦記着休息的日子，幽居在辦公室裏無聊的時候，或是伏在櫃台上打盹的時候，想想前幾天安逸蕭閒的情景，總不免要哼一聲「而今安在哉」？吧。</p>
<p>而今安在哉：「清一色三代」和「舞后」的腿以及「梅博士」的······啊！</p>
<p>×　　×　　×　　　×</p>
<p>也許有人要問；在這「嶄新」的年頭兒，我們在上海的人究竟幹些什麽事消遣消遣呢？那我立刻可以回說，除了「清一色三代」以外，大部分的人，都悲育「國難」之到臨拼命地在幹「救國」的工作。譬如援助東北義勇軍游藝會以及「梅博士」表演救濟東北難民的義務戲的戲院門口，不是黑越：人山人海地擁擠不是笨到不可敎的笨伯，總不會說這是去「欣賞色相」或是「尋快樂」去的。據說這裏面並沒有「娱樂」可尋，救國和如樂連接，自然是牛頭不對馬嘴的。這裏面的一切，都會使你觸目驚心，足使你驚惕一番的。少女們足不停趾的跳舞，會使你「心疼」，面紅耳赤的；梅博士的宛轉悲凉的歌聲，會使你「熱涙潮湧」的；因此悲痛國尀伯人，都蜂擁地到這裏面去去和大家有心人「同聲一哭」而冰天雪地中的義勇軍和難民也就拜受無限的貺惠了。「霓裳羽衣」救國振災，已得到成功，這是一九三三「新」一年的「新」事實丨</p>
<p>×　　×　　×　　×</p>
<p>我們在新年瞭望台上瞭望一番，望見北角的烽火又起了。聽得第三次的警鐘，又震天地響起來了！</p>
<p>竟想不到國家民族的危機就在這嶄新的年頭更加厲害了。我們得快起來救國，我們得採用「新法子」去救，於是，我們喊：</p>
<p>歌得響吧，我們替我們的壯士呐喊！</p>
<p>舞得勁吧，我們替我們的健兒助威！</p>
<p>漁陽　鼓勁地來，霓羽衣起勁兒舞吧！</p>

<p>— 文炳</p>
<p>這是友人某君告訴我的，事件是發生在××大學。</p>
<p>因爲學期快要結束了，所以夜間還在補課，敎授旣還有心來補，當學生的也似乎難爲情像不去上；於是××大學夜來也就儼如白日：大概是日間上課太上慣慣吧，學生們倒不以上夜課是如何枯燥的事，旣是補課，而又是夜間，那是來得更寫意了。</p>
<p>敎授儘管講得起勁，學生們却像躺在沙發上的情態，有的歪着頭在拍紙簿在劃，那都是大同小異的速寫人像，譬如替孫總理速寫過後，然後又替孫夫人慶齡女士在旁邊加速一個；有些覺得這種速寫太平凡了，不如替眼前幾位摩登密司費點神，或者是描摹一位狀貌特殊的男同學；有些覺得還是喁喁細語的好；有些便漫意擲丢紙團；夜來原是休息的時候，所以偷着讀小說的，却不像日間的多。</p>
<p>「咚咚咚」課堂門在斷續地響。</p>
<p>「誰」？敎授放下課本，兩眼瞟視着課堂門說，於是響聲停止了，然而課堂裏却頓時呈現着不安了。</p>
<p>「咚咚咚」又在響了，敎授下了台，把門一開，發現一個短衿月友，站在門口。</p>
<p>「幹什麽」；敎授問：</p>
<p>「找念秒爺，楊家小姐呌阿拉拉車子來接，還是下半日四點半鐘就來了，此刻快九點鐘了，弗知念少爺今晚阿去跳舞········」</p>
<p>「𠻜」！敎授嗤了一聲，轉身把門帶關，課堂裏忽然起了哄然的笑浪，你望着我，我望着你，其中××同學的臉色最難看，一陣紅，一陣白，神相顯得十分地不安。</p>
<p>話說那短衫朋友是××跳舞塲舞女楊家小姐的包車夫，這次可眞觸了霉頭，因爲他拉楊家小姐的包車，總是從家裏把小姐拉到跳舞塲，然後再到××大旅社或是××飯店去接拉××老爺或是××少爺，那是很便當的事體，事前小姐已用電話通知，或是旅館裏的茶房老早先生來了電話，只要車子一去，馬上有胖胖的一個人拉轉來：他從不曾到大學裏去拉過什麽人，所以他把車子拉到××大學門口，頗覺有些茫然。</p>
<p>然而茫然儘管茫然。車子豈可空回？於是他便去門房，門房說什麽念少爺是找不到的，起碼要有姓，於是他說了姓，王，門房又說要有名字，於是他搔了搔頭，歪着嘴說？「名字倒弗曉得！」門房將他很視了一眼，照拂旁的事情去了，於是他更覺得茫然，然而他的使命並沒有達到，雖是茫然，也還要另想方法，車子豈可空回？</p>
<p>時間已是八點多鐘了，不但自已的肚皮有些餓，小姐在舞塲裏更不知是如何的焦灼。於是他想到辦公處去探問探問，却也覺得沒有多少把握，但爲了車子豈可空回，那又不得不去，他剛踏上辦公處的石階，適巧遇着似乎面熟的××校役說：「辦公處要有些不便去，是不是，找高高的那姓王的念少爺：在那裏上課來，來，我領你去「丨車、的心忽然輕鬆了許多，覺得責任有些着落了小姐的」猪玀」的駡罰或者可以避免，。</p>
<p>只是念少爺未免有些不顧人情，縱不爲在課堂門外呆立着的車夫着急，也該想楊家小姐眼巴巴地在舞塲裏的企望</p>
<p>臉上一阵紅，一陣白，許多同學的眼睛都釘牢着××同學，使他未免有些躊躇？「早退堂就去，下了課才去呢？」</p>

<p>— 阿絜</p>
<p>時代之神，鼓着翅膀，不住地向前飛去；這二十一年將完結了。我們把這一年裏仔細檢點一下，甚麽外交，内政，軍事，敎育，國難，盜匪，民生，···來結一篇總賬，正所謂『一部二十四史，從何說起！』唉·回顧過去，瞻念來日，誰不起不無窮之感！</p>
<p>東三省地圖改了顏色，三百五十餘萬方里的膏腴土地，到那裏去了？二千四百餘萬的同胞做了亡國奴嗎？森林，煤，鐵，豆，麥，金礦，鐵路，關稅···變做誰人的產業了？雖有幾百萬的羲勇軍，斷脰流血，把赤心熱血和暴日拚命，不曉得這一年中死亡了多少！把頭顱去和猛烈的飛機，砲彈交换，能有多少成績呢！可是在這一年中，大家只知道躱在後面，高聲喊着抵抗！抵抗！倒像煞有介事。而袞袞諸公，耶穌自有道理，令人莫测高深。况且暴日得隴望蜀，封豕長蛇的野心，眞是可怕，目下熱河的砲聲正鬧得響亮，恐怕在我們貴國同胞的聽覺裏，還當作蓼蓼的臘鼓聲哩！</p>
<p>對於禦侮的賬，雖然繳不出；自家打架的一篇賬，却羅羅清楚，簡直沒有一筆『混　賬』！侄兒來打爸叔，付了幾律老百姓倒霉的賬；這個驅遂那箇，付了幾筆搬塲的賬；新官上任，老官請出，在這走馬燈的上面，付了幾筆升官發財的賬；盜匪的殺人放火，鄕村老百姓，走頭無路，付了幾筆逃命的賬。民生凋敝，風俗日壞，自殺啦，姦淫啦，搶刦啦，······希奇古怪，一塌糊塗，年荒世亂，在下簡直報不出這二十一年的總賬呢！</p>

<p>謝你看過了梅蘭芳的覇王别姬和南京大戲院的蠻女天堂，還高抬玉指翻上這張附刋；並且費了你許多寳貴的光陰，讀完我的「屁」文字。我將不知怎樣的說話好？</p>
<p>接着你信的時候，我剛從寫字間回來：就是說我以汗血換來了一天的三餐茶飯。拖着疲倦的身心，預備在小小的亭子間中休息，不過日寇改攻平津的消息，我印進了腦海以後，沒有磨滅過。　　本來化了兩三塊錢，看了京戲，跳舞，雜要·······以及涉在舞女叢中，分不出身價來的「你」，我不怕厚臉說「盡了救國之責」吧！「救國」是怎樣的一回事？恕我年輕無知，更沟有「你」的李先生的伶利口才，把「救國」天花亂墜的在「嘴上衝鋒。」因爲你要知道我的别後情形，就拉雜的寫上一陣，誰料這樣得罪了，李先生的夫人，「放浪的孩子」自知罪該萬死，所以看完了你的信後，我站起身靜默了三分鐘。</p>
<p>「不過在這亂哄哄的年頭兒，假如亡國就在目前的事，可以放在其次，我還得每天掙扎我的三餐苦茶淡飯，······」當然，我的良心是驅責着我不應說這樣的話，不過我沒有强大的拳頭，東沒有强全的身體，所幸還有鐵一般的意志，「救國」是各方面的事，義勇軍浴血抗日是救國，政府通電長期抵抗也是救國，甚而至於喝茶，飲酒，跳舞，······都是「救國」：我做我的工，我吃我的飯，沒有做漢奸，沒有做對不起國家，社會，自已的事，大概也可說一聲消極「救國」吧。</p>
<p>最後你說上海的居民已忘了東北有三百萬方里被强寇奪去的關外，要捐一個銅板，他們是像給乞丐般的施段的。所以有這游藝救國大會的舉行。有舞跳有游藝看，化掉幾塊錢是並不在乎的，你抱着「救國」的責任，犠牲色相，自願參加，恕我無禮，竟得罪了一位這樣愛國的女子，不，夫人。「救國」就是這樣的一回事，謝你給我打破了這悶葫蘆。所謂聽君一席話，勝讀十年書！</p>
<p>不過我得聲明，本刋的篇幅和你的跳舞時間一樣寳貴。能否你翻梅蘭芳的時候，見到這信，還是個問題，所以鄭重聲明，以後來函，恕不作答。</p>

<p>整日價忙着工作，身體已感到極度的疲乏，一躺上床，便頭暈腦暈地睡着了，近日我只有等候睡時的到臨，睡果我於我是無上的安慰境界，日間所受的苦痛，無論是社會所給予的，或是自已招惹的；無論是物質方面的，或是精神方面的；都可在睡中化解，不，簡直都可幻成紅的白的鮮豔的花朶。</p>
<p>自然囉，在晚上我做過許多甜蜜而偉大的夢：</p>
<p>我自已也不大明白，原前是那樣孱弱的身體，竟成了一個雄糾糾的武夫，腰上佩着雪白的利刀，手擎着長剌刀的步槍，踏着冰天雪地的戰壕「叭，叭，叭，」向身人射放，敵人都應聲一個個偃斃了，鮮血流到了我們的戰壕，我用兩手合取着狂飲，我高聲地唱着民族之歌。</p>
<p>而且我還有個很漂亮而且具有同樣意識的愛人，她也荷着戰械，伏在壕裏向敵人射擊，她的兩頰緋紅，是敵血浴紅的，她的兩腿肥大，是奔走殺敵練成的，有時我急了，她安慰我不要燥暴，有時我胆怯了，她告訴我要沉着，她說我們在收復失地以後，便好生育一個肥胖的小孩，留作紀念。</p>
<p>果然失地由我們收復了，我們的民族得了新的誕生，東北還是我們的東北，民衆的痛苦解除了，自已的痛苦也消失了，大家都歌着勝利之曲。</p>
<p>「汪，汪，汪，」犬吠響透了窗前門外，我從夢中驚醒，順手把額角一摸，是濕淋淋地一把冷汗，自已很是憤恨爲什麽還躺在這冷冰冰的木板床上，眞是沒用處的僵屍。</p>
<p>犬不住地吠，窗下有急緊的脚步聲，間壁的人在開門小解，「呀，有賊，快捉呀」！於是犬更吠得急噪，脚步聲却隱隱地消滅了，我也起了戒心，其實這於我有何妨？除了書架上的幾部破書，還有什麽可招賊的光顧？我想賊怎麽這樣不怕冷。昏天黑地的摸索，無非也是要延續生命，肚皮饑餓了，有什麽辦法好想？</p>
<p>犬吠止息了，反使我再也睡不着了，靜寂中隱約地聽見間壁綢莊的大腹便便×老閭的鼾睡聲，我想他也許在做着更偉大的夢：</p>
<p>商通有無，誰說日貨不可買？本來做買賣的是想多賺幾個，前面有汽車大王，煤油大王······做我們榜樣，什麽會來查究我麽，我可不睬！或者賄幾個錢給那般窮小子，也就得了！再不然，索性改牌售賣，反正我們的大國民全都貪便宜，你也好，我也好，大家同躋富域，東北失了，要什麽緊，現在的世界，根本是天下一家，等到我有了幾十萬家當，捐輸點本也沒哈關係，現在可不興！</p>
<p>腦子越想越清醒了，休想再睡，那大腹便便的×老閭，彷彿在天花板上晃動。</p>
<p>爬下床抽香烟，才記起今早晒在門外的皮鞋忘記了收，犬吠聲又似乎在我的耳邊作響，我也賴得開門去尋了，在不在，頗難斷測。</p>
<p>烟也並不能催睡，腦子却更怪暈了</p>
<p>「的打，的打，」的鐘擺，忽而「噹，噹」的響了五下，我睜着兩眼向窗外一望，已有了魚肚色的　晨了，於是我便披上衣，跳出被窩，仍舊忙着我的工作。</p>

<p>— 編者</p>
<p>在接到許多讀者的來信中，大多數表示着需要共同的團結。所以本欄關於組織團體的信件，已發表了不少。不過，組織一個團體，並不是容易的事，而尤其是組織一個完善的團體。</p>
<p>現在，據我們所知，已具有團體的雛形及已在發軔的，已經有了三個；這不過單就店員工友學徒的立塲及其有關係者所組織的而方。他們都具有絕大的毅力，和百折不撓的精神；雖然前途的成功與否現在尚不能斷言，但我們至少要曉得：一種組織的成功，實基於主持者丨丨丨中堅份子的精神。</p>
<p>一種宗旨純正的組織，我們雖不能居於領導者的地位去努力主持，但從旁贊助的責任是義不容辭的，所以我們抱着十二分的熱誠，希望他們早日成功，對社會方面有所貢獻，對人羣面方有所裨益。同時我們對於具有遠大目光，感到急切需要，因而自動起來組織的店員工友學徒們，居然能排除萬難，逐漸的朝着成功的途上走去！也表示着十二分的欽敬。</p>
<p>在未介紹這三個團體與讀者之前，我們先貢獻一點意見，以表示鼓舞互勉的㣲意；「失敗爲成功之母」這名格言，諒來諸位都曉得的，假使前途碰到點阻碍，或是受到點打擊！切切不可灰心，那時就要記起這名格言，再接再厲，努力奮鬥；須知受到的打擊愈大，以後的基礎愈固。以下便是三個團體的大槪</p>
<p>（一）靑年工讀社　他扻的宣言中說；「·········停戰協定告成之後，百業蕭條，民不聊生；更深知非根本從勞動敎育切實辦理以增高民智而發掦民氣，則我中華民族不足以再圖安内攘外而生存於世界。······凡事最切實而有益於社會者，大抵最難於成功；苟知其困難之點而預爲之計，則行亦易矣。·········且今日旣知難而進，則他日决不見難而退。·········」我們從這裏面可以看出，他們的具有「必成之心」，並且是「謀定後動」。以精密的計劃去實施「勞動敎育」。他們的宗旨是「提倡手腦並用」！漸漸達到「沒有不讀而工的苦力，和不工而讀的遊民」。並且於經費方面，亦已有相當的基礎，以蓬萊市塲爲實施區域，然後再逐漸的擴展，創辦人匡仲謀周肇基等均甚熱心。在點在小西門中華職業學校校友會。</p>
<p>（二）業餘學術研究社　這一個組織與第一個組織微有不同，第一個組織是勞資雙方合作以謀社會制度之改革的，所以計劃比較偉大。這一個組織却完全是店員等感覺自身智識之恐慌，利用業餘光陰來作積極的補救，所以他的範圍止限於「學術研究」與精神上的互助。進行方面亦比較簡易一些。他們來信說；『·········雖然現在還沒有正式成立，但已有相當的人數，籌備會亦已開過三四次，章程亦已擬定。現在在廣招社員，祇須是正式的店員工友學徒，都可以加入。········』他們並且說；『········店員自身之得到解放，必須要有充分之學識，羣策羣力而後可········我們因爲「星期學術討論會」太狹義了，所以改爲「業餘學術研究社」。········』發起人張四維等，通訊處是本埠郵政信箱二○四九號合中企業公司張四維君轉。</p>
<p>（三）職工自治協進社　這一個組織與第二個組織是同一立塲，同一意義，而範圍又比較要廣泛之點。他的來信說；『·········我即然不是大智大慧的人，但我正好用我的愚笨的頭腦，去做一點愚笨的工作。仝時我又感覺到我的力量微小，但社會上這種微小力量，一定不在少數，·········我决意從今日始，脚踏實地的去幹，集中這許多的微小力量，組織成一個集團，這集團的定名，就是「職工自治協進社」·········』這種堅毅的精神，我們很是佩服。他們並且預定了工藝製造，學術研究，合作事業，正當娱樂，旅行等計劃，創辦人劉新民，地點，民國路新開河一六四號。</p>
<p>我們知道要改造社會之不良制度，必須先有組織，並且需要有力的組織，庶幾可以達到良好環境的目的，以上的三個組織，便是改造環境之嚆矢，希望大家不斷的去努力，早日完成這個重大的使命。</p>

<p>老二，去年的租稻賬挨到今年這時候未算賬，總對得你住吧？你還欠着四擔五斗稻呢。這五斗稻不用人說，我推讓了。還有這四擔，你願意折錢呢？你願意給我稻？王老二上了一旱烟斗烟絲，靠階篬邊的風車站了，很懊喪的樣子慢呑呑的道：向東家老爹求個情罷。去年那種年成，那個地方，也不能收十成租。東家道：依你說，難道這四擔多稻，我全讓了。說時，他將賬簿又翻了一下，當是審查的樣子，搖了頭道：不行！我那一個莊子，也沒有讓過這多。於是這些吃了飯的人，都有做中的義務，都來相勸着。孟國寳在大家議論之後，他就揷嘴道：我父親也是收租的人，我不偏了那邊，說句公道話。去年八九月新稻登塲的時候，只賣三四塊錢一擔。東家來挑稻，佃户有稻。今年四月以後，稻賣到五六塊錢一擔，而且佃户家裏的稻，早也就變賣了。這個時候，要挑稻，佃户自然是沒有。要折錢比起去秋來，一比每擔稻，佃户要吃兩塊多錢的虧，人家種田的人，如何受得民。東家紅了臉道：據孟先生說，倒好像是做東家的人，有心拖到這個日子來結帳了。可不知去年秋天，我就催他起，老不結清，我有什麽法子，再不結清，新稻又要出來了。王老二道：那裏是我不結清，就是去年給的那些租稻，我已經賠了，東家還要我那裏拿得出來呢？孟國寳道；老二，你也有不是，去秋你把稻給完了，就該聲明一句，不能再給稻了。若是單對東家聲明了，那也不行，因爲你說對東家聲明了，東家倒說你沒有聲明，那還是不明白。你應該把這話到區裏報告一下。現在區裏的先生，都是靑年學生，一定能講公道話的。他這樣說着，句句是告訴王老二，可是他的嗓音很大，分明都是告訴那東家聽的。</p>

<h3 id="c283">巴里穆亞家族合作鉅構 <a href="#c283" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e283" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">283</a></h3>
<p>— 燦爛</p>
<p>巴里穆亞，人人都知道他們是美國藝術界唯一的人景仰的了。是在好萊塢，更沒有别的家族，比他們再光榮再受人景仰的了。現在銀幕上我知道的大明星，雖然只有他們同胞三位丨里昂</p>
<p>Ｌionel約翰Ｊohn和伊賽爾Ｆthel丨然而他們族中人，服務於電影廠的正不知幾許，並且他們的祖先，更有不少舞臺上的著名人物。即使現在百老匯中，還有許多巴里穆亞族中的人。所以合衆國的藝術界，都推崇他們爲「美洲最高貴的族氏」ＴheＭostＲoyalＦamilyofＡmenica。</p>
<p>雖然這樣，巴里穆亞的門楣同時也神秘得很。他們和外界接觸極少。新聞記者更是不受歡迎。所以人們所知道的。只有他們是愛好藝術的。他們家庭中有極豐富的藏書室，極華貴的貯藏室，他們收買了無數的彫刻品古玩和名畫，不過從來沒有外人進去觀光過。近來他們態度有些改變了，常舉行盛大的宴會，但是賓朋所能到的地方，仍只有他們寓中壯麗的客廳飯廳和花園而已。</p>
<p>他們在影片中，素來是各不聞問，自已努力於本身的偉大事業。雖然同居着，但是生活方面，也是分得很清楚。</p>
<p>到了去年（一九三二）影界巨輸的輾變，他們在銀幕上，就有了合作的必要，第一次是亞森魯平，（上海已映過）第二次是飯店（約三月初旬上海即行公映）。這兩片的問世，博得了全世界的歡迎，更增加了他們的榮譽。其實，這僅僅是里昂和約翰的合作。</p>
<p>他們認清了現代藝術的途徑，合作才能有更大的成切，所以這近的合作，把伊賽爾也添上了。新片的名字呌Ｒaspuuin。是述一個俄國的故事，這係巴里穆亞三位，自已選的本事。里昂飾一位年邁神秘的僧侶，約翰飾一帝國的大軍人，另外還有一個主角是貴婦，正好留給伊賽爾。這樣三位大明星作這三個鼎足並重的角色，成績定有驚人的地步。而且佈景和服飾，都是眞切異常。據說米高美公司爲這張片子犠牲極大。公司中人，認爲這是繼大飯店的唯一巨片。不過伊賽爾近來眼睛不大好，不願意受炭精燈的刺激太大，所以每天祇有很短的工作。這樣是呌Ｒasputin要緩期完成的。</p>

<p>大概去年夏季罷，瓊克勞馥和李琳甘許二人，發起留一排劉海髮在前額，一時目爲時尚，好萊塢的女子，羣起倣效，天天在境子剪刀上用功，現在康絲登蓓納脫發明了一種前劉海，是一束短髮，燙成半月形，埀在左邊眉際，她第一次留成這種式子，在攝雷電華新片『犠牲』Ｒookabye的時候，大衆贊美她，於是效法的人又不少，當作最時髦的修飾，</p>
<p>目前好萊塢女子最風行的是一種尖角式的氈帽，這種氈帽所以風行的原因，因爲耐姗卡路在『狂歡禮拜六』一片中戴着牠受到人家極端稱美，所以一到星期六的下午，好萊塢的時髦女郎沒有一個不戴着這種氈帽的，這種帽子在美國呌ＭickeyＭouseＨat在英國呌ＢretonＨar，顏色各種都有，耐姗戴的是棕色的，從前鄕下姑娘都戴這種帽子，不料現在做了時髦人物心目中的愛物，</p>

<p>葛麗安特ＧwiliＡndre在『棄夫』一片中穿的一件晚外套，衣服的裏邊有寬緊帶，可以伸縮，外面看不出的衣袖緊窄，袖口上鑲一段皮，大家驚嘆葛麗的聰明。這種外衣，稱爲衣中冠軍，效法的多，是無容細說了，</p>
<p>雷電華明星曼莉曼遜ＭaryＭason近來戴一種靈巧的戒子，裏面可以安放照片，於是又震驚了好萊塢全埠，假如一個時尚男子，而沒有一個女子拿他的照片放在她的戒子裏的話，這個人可以丢到太平洋中去了，</p>

<p>「聰明三女子」中的主角琪恩哈羅，是美國密蘇里州肯塞斯人，她現在二十二歲。</p>
<p>她的父親是木匠，十三歲時，她的父親死了。她的母親和她二人，爲着前途起見，就搬到好萊塢，賃居在一家公寓裏。當時有一個戲子呌ＷyndhamＳtanidng新從英國到好萊塢，從事銀幕生活，也住在這公寓裏，因此他們由常常相見而變成相識了，這是她接近影界人物的第一遭。</p>
<p>有一次，她到福克斯公司找一位朋友，那朋友因爲她生就一種動人的美貌，就乘便和她去見導演，導演見了，就要求她做一個額外演員，後來被ＨalＲoach公司羅致，訂成五年的合同。</p>
<p>過了一年，霍華特許士想着手，攝製「地獄天使」，當時的主角，是一個挪威美女子呌葛萊泰妮蓀，在她一部份工作完畢後，因爲某舞臺的合同關係，不得不到紐約去，因此缺了一個主角。許士在幾百個女演員裏，還是找不出代替的。那時ＪamesＨall和ＢenＬyon，（在該片扮一個少年軍人）恰巧碰到了琪恩哈羅，就很歡喜的介紹與許士，許士很屬意，琪恩的名，因此就哄動一時。</p>

<p>— 靑霞</p>
<p>韓雲珍，誰都知道她是個老牌影星；大約在六七年之前吧，她的大名，也許不亞於現在的胡蝶；戲拍得很多，因爲她善於餙演浪漫角色的緣故，便有人給她提了個綽號呌「騷姐姐。」</p>
<p>她自脫離影界而和人結婚以後，便染了嗜好，精神是萎頓得很，身子也非常衰弱；昔日的「健美，」無形抛到九霄雲外。一副瘦削而慘白的面龐，無論誰見了，總不會相信她就是嚋昔在電影界曾負盛譽的韓雲珍。</p>
<p>她丈夫時常勸她戒去；她也痛恨嗜好；咒咀自已的荒唐。於是，她打主定意，决心戒絕嗜好。</p>
<p>如今，她已嗜好戒掉了，身子似乎强壯得多；徐娘雖已半老，可是從前的風度，重又回復轉了。她歡喜得幾乎發狂。據人說，她不久或將重爲馮婦，再度現身銀幕。我們且試目以觀其後吧！</p>

<p>有一天保羅到華沙去訪桑尼阿。她似笑非笑地道：「保羅你這個善說謊的人，你又要對我說許多花言巧語的話了。」</p>

<p>Lin Yu: On the 10th, at 7:00 AM, over a hundred mixed cavalry troops, along with a unit of infantry and artillery, approximately one regiment, of the Japanese insurgents, attacked Kou Bei Kou, thirty-odd miles north of Shan Hai Guan, engaging our guard cavalry. Our troops fiercely resisted, and the enemy made no progress. At noon, four enemy planes bombed our troops and used machine guns for strafing to provide cover for the advancing infantry and cavalry. Our troops urgently dispatched a unit to reinforce, and fierce fighting continued until 4:00 PM. Although Kou Bei Kou is strategically important, since the fall of Yu Guan, the area has lost its strategic value. Today's attack by the Japanese troops did not surprise our military authorities. (Special Dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>Lin Yu: As of the time of this dispatch, the battle at Kou Bei Kou has ceased. The Public Security Bureau and reputable businesses have been bombed and destroyed by enemy aircraft, resulting in significant losses. The enemy has retreated and gathered in the vicinity of Lijiahou, and it is anticipated that they will continue the attack on the 11th. Our troops are temporarily taking a defensive posture, while also increasing troop strength at Shi Men Zhai and maintaining strict vigilance. Furthermore, there has been no activity on the western bank of Shi He. Merchant ships transporting supplies and ammunition arrived in Qin Huang Dao on both the 9th and 10th, unloading at Pier No. 4 for storage in the Japanese barracks. (Special Dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Kou Bei Kou and Shi Men Zhai are still in the hands of our troops, and solid fortifications have been built. An enemy attack was repelled. (Special Dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The front line has reached a stalemate. There was no battle at Shi He on the 10th. Only three enemy ships remain in Qin Huang Dao. On the morning of the 9th, over a hundred marines landed ashore, for the purpose of purchasing food and resting at the Japanese barracks; this was not a full-scale landing. It was widely rumored in Beijing on the afternoon of the 10th that an enemy armored train had arrived at Qin Huang Dao station on the morning of the 10th. A reporter inquired via long-distance telephone on the evening of the 10th, and it was claimed that our Zhongshan armored train was guarding the west bank of Shi He. The rumor of an enemy armored train arriving in Qin Huang Dao is inaccurate. The city is peaceful and quiet. Enemy planes have not dropped bombs for two days, and people's hearts are gradually calming down. Many small shops have resumed business. The enemy's offensive deployment in Re He includes the Nishiyi 8th Division, the Han traitor Cheng Guorui's brigade, and two rebellious army brigades. Furthermore, the Tamon 2nd Division, including the Amano 15th Brigade of that division, has been transferred from Shenyang to Jinzhou. Five trains of the Nagatani 3rd Brigade have passed Shenyang from Changchun to the west. (Special Dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>(Beijing) After over a hundred Japanese marines landed in Qin Huang Dao yesterday morning, the situation suddenly became tense. This morning, Japanese sentries expanded their patrol lines north of the railway. Our garrison troops are maintaining strict vigilance and have sent personnel to negotiate with the Japanese military. Residents feel quite uneasy, and most major stores did not open this morning. (Special Dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>(Beijing) Before the Yu Guan case is resolved, military action has broken out at Kou Bei Kou, fifteen miles away. A dispatch from Tokyo states that the Japanese military has occupied Kou Bei Kou, which leads into Re He. However, local Chinese officials contacted He Zhuoguo by phone at 5:00 PM this evening and learned that He is well aware of the Japanese actions, but the Japanese military has not yet made contact with the cavalry guarding the southern entrance to the fortress. It is speculated that the Japanese military may have arrived at the northern entrance to the fortress from Jinzhou, but is still several miles away from the Chinese army. If the Japanese military attempts to pass through this fortress, the Chinese army will stop them. Kou Bei Kou is the most important pass between Yu Guan and eastern Re He. In 1924, Zhang Zuolin and Wu Peifu fought a decisive battle here. (Reuters Dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>(Beijing) At 5:00 AM this morning, the Japanese military fired three heavy artillery shells at our Shi He position. Our troops returned fire, and the firing quickly ceased. At 7:00 AM, three Japanese planes surveyed our rear positions and dropped two bombs on Hai Yang Zhen. The bombs did not explode. There were no conflicts on the front lines. The Japanese military is building fortifications outside the city of Yu Guan, and the construction is complete. (Special Dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>(Beijing) The Japanese garrison commander Wakagawa, along with Lieutenant Colonel Ono of the 8th Division, inspected the various positions last night. Because we are determined to resist with force, the Japanese have been actively building defensive works in Yu Guan for days, intending to hold their ground. Qin Huang Dao is peaceful. (Special Dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>(Beijing) After landing on the coast of the Xin Kai He east of Qin Huang Dao, the Japanese marines immediately practiced tactical exercises near the railway. Fifty-six Japanese women and children returned to Dalian on the Chang Ping Maru. Rumors are rampant in Qin Island. (Special Dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>(Beijing) Over a thousand refugees have fled from Yu Guan and are gathered at Qin Island station, waiting for trains west. (Special Dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>(Qin Huang Dao) Within the last seven days, the Chinese army has created sophisticated defensive works along a small river about three miles west of Yu Guan, including many bomb shelters, forming a natural defensive position. A special Reuters correspondent today visited the Chinese front line east of Qin Huang Dao to inspect these defensive works. However, the riverbed is dry and can be crossed at almost any point. The temperature is currently very low, and the cold wind cuts to the bone, but the morale of the Chinese soldiers is high. Thanks to General He Zhuguo's kindness, he allowed Chinese and foreign film crews to film the troops performing war scenes in the trenches. It is said that these trenches are the ones that stopped the Japanese advance on January 3rd. During the filming, the sound of engines was heard from the north. General He told the special Reuters correspondent that this probably came from Kou Bei Kou, ten miles north, because he had heard that the puppet Manchukuo army had advanced to that area. General He also mentioned that the Chinese soldiers suffered many casualties in the battle of Yu Guan because the city's defenders were loyal, brave, and patriotic, fighting to the death. Even though the commanding officer saw that continued resistance was futile and ordered a retreat, the soldiers paid no attention. Today, the Japanese police chief in Qin Huang Dao had Chinese soldiers and civilians beaten and tied up at the train station, but later the Chinese military commander ordered their release and apologized to the Japanese side. (Reuters Dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>(Beijing) The battle of Kou Bei Kou is currently underway. The Japanese military wants to seize the fortress that connects the provinces of Re He and Hebei. He Zhuguo is temporarily cut off from Kou Bei Kou. A cable now states that Japanese infantry, cavalry, and artillery forces advanced from Yu Guan towards Kou Bei Kou today. They made contact with Chinese cavalry in the morning. After a brief skirmish, the Chinese army retreated slightly, but the Japanese advance was slow due to the rugged mountain roads. Considering the Chinese army's resistance, the Japanese military called in bombers for support. Around noon, four Japanese planes flew to the Chinese positions, and the Chinese army had already gathered reinforcements to defend against them. The battle continued into the afternoon. The Chinese army had anticipated that the Japanese military would attempt to seize this fortress, so they have been preparing for the enemy for days. This time, they will obviously be able to put up some resistance against the Japanese military. The Shi He line remained quiet in the afternoon and was not affected by the battle of Kou Bei Kou. (Reuters Dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>(Beijing) Telephone communications between Beijing and Qin Huang Dao are still open. The situation in Qin Huang Dao is quite serious. (Special Dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>(Beijing) U.S. Attaché Major Grolatte traveled to Yu Guan to investigate and returned to Qin Island at 10:00 AM this morning. He has already prepared a report for the U.S. Embassy in Beijing. It is said that he met with Brigade Commander Suzuki in Yu Guan. There are approximately a thousand Japanese soldiers in the area. (Special Dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>(Beijing) The Shi He area was quiet this morning. Over a hundred Japanese cavalrymen from Er Lang Miao moved towards Kou Bei Kou. In order to consolidate their defenses at Yu Guan, the Japanese military decided to attack that location. The Motohashi cavalry unit and the combined infantry and artillery units are advancing from Suizhong towards the outskirts of Kou Bei Kou. (Special Dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>(Beijing) The righteous army of Kou Bei Kou's Yong An Fort engaged the Japanese military. The situation is unclear. (Special Dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>Japanese Troops Pressing Lingyuan</p>
<h3 id="e4">More Japanese Troops Continue to Arrive at Chao Yang Si, Japanese Armored Cars Shell the Dong Brigade's Positions <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>(Beijing) According to people from Re He, the situation on the Re He border is becoming more tense. More Japanese troops continue to arrive at Chaoyang Temple, the Japanese military headquarters, and dispatching is very busy. A major battle is imminent. Wang Jianxi, of the puppet army's 1st Army, under Cheng Guorui, has recently been active on the Re He border, attempting to buy off local ruffians and miscreants, plotting illegal activities. Planes fly to various places daily, scattering leaflets to tempt the righteous army. The strength of the righteous army in Re He is substantial, but it is worrying because the ground is frozen due to the cold weather, making it difficult to build defensive works. Currently, the important town of Re He is Lingyuan, which is strategically located, with connections to Chaoyang, Pingquan, Chifeng, and Kaiqiu. If the Japanese military attacks west, the above towns will inevitably be under pressure. Other inland areas are not in immediate danger due to the mountainous terrain. (Special Dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Several enemy planes from Jinzhou fly to Kailu, Chaoyang, and Lingyuan every day to conduct reconnaissance and scatter leaflets, disturbing the people's minds. (Special Dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>(Beijing) The Japanese armored cars at Chao Yang Si were originally only two trains. After the Yu Guan incident, the Japanese military transferred one train away. Yesterday, three armored trains suddenly arrived from Jinzhou, stopping at the Chaoyang Temple and Zhoujiatun stations. At the same time, two trains of troops arrived from Yixian, carrying thousands of Japanese soldiers. The Japanese are actively reinforcing troops along the Jinzhou-Chaoyang Road, and their plans for action in Re He are becoming clearer. Our army is guarding the Nanling positions north of Kou Bei Ying Zi, sharpening their swords and preparing to meet the enemy. The righteous armies of Kailu and Fuxin have been engaged in fierce battles with the Japanese military for days. (Special Dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>(Beijing) The Re He National Salvation Army, under Mi Demen, has over 20,000 soldiers, stationed in six counties, including Heishan, Beizhen, Zhangwu, Tai'an, Xinmin, and Fuxin, making it a formidable righteous army on the Re He border. Due to a lack of supplies, they came to Beijing for assistance and will return to their defense positions within days. (Special Dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>(Beijing) The Japanese Mogi Division, approximately a brigade, along with artillery, cavalry, and other forces, totaling over ten thousand, advanced from Suizhong along the Lingyuan highway on the 8th. This morning, they advanced to Beizhangyingzi, a place on the Re He border, over sixty li from Suizhong, very close to the forward positions of our Lingyuan garrison. The situation is becoming more tense, and a major battle appears imminent. (Special Dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>(Beijing) After the Japanese repeatedly invaded Re He, the local vitality was greatly damaged. Re He's food supply is also being monopolized by the Japanese side. Recently, Tang Yulin discussed with Yin Yien, chairman of the Re He Chamber of Commerce, banning the export of grain and controlling speculative merchants. Therefore, Re He millet is now only selling for seven jiao per dou, and the Xingye notes have also rebounded. (Special Dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>(Beijing) Dong Futing, brigade commander of the Re He army, reported from his defense area to Beijing that on the morning of the 9th, a Japanese armored car arrived from Chao Yang Si and shelled our positions with 7-inch steel cannons, firing about a dozen rounds. At noon, planes also came to Lingnan for reconnaissance. All officers and soldiers of the brigade have long been determined to sacrifice themselves. If the enemy invades, we will definitely resist to the death. (Special Dispatch, 10th)</p>

However, it is heard that Liu Zigan has renewed news of a counterattack on Chengdu. If so, it will be difficult to quell the situation in Sichuan. The Sichuan Affairs Reorganization Committee, which the central government intends to organize as an agency to resolve Sichuan affairs, is expected to be realized soon. As for the Sichuan Provincial Government and the Post-War Rehabilitation Superintendent's Office, it is still desired to preserve them. The events decided by the Sichuan Affairs Reorganization Committee will be handed over to the relevant authorities for execution. Regarding the selection of personnel, the central government is currently looking for candidates, but it must wait until the organizational regulations of the committee are approved by the Central Political Committee before they can be proposed.

<h3 id="e58">Resistance and Struggle by Hui <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>1.  The Meaning of Resistance</p>
<p>Since the September 18th Incident, the entire nation has been talking about resistance and everyone has been saying that only resistance can lead to survival. It seems that our resistance alone is enough to make the enemy fear and no longer advance. If we resist again, the lost territory of the Northeast can be recovered, and the past national humiliations can be eliminated. Therefore, there is even more talk of "long-term resistance," believing that this can encourage the people of the country and also slightly ease the enemy's threat. However, one year and four months have passed since the incident. The occupation of Shenyang and the fall of Jinzhou have not been recovered. Among them, only the Battle of Shanghai was where we suffered unprecedented losses, but we were not humiliated and still had the qualifications for equal peace talks. The resistance in Jilin and Heilongjiang has only left behind bloody historical traces, waiting for future liquidation.</p>
<p>Resistance means that when the enemy comes to attack, we resist. Then the situation of the host and guest is different. People are active, and we are passive, with no room for self-determination. If people don't come to attack, we will waste troops and food and be unable to do anything. It's like being trapped in a besieged city, with hungry people inside and strong bandits outside, seeking temporary peace but without long-term plans. No mistake in planning is greater than this. Moreover, resistance is purely a passive attitude, conservative rather than progressive. In today's world, not only are all things progressing and changing rapidly, but all countries are also seeking accelerated development. To plan a country while being conservative is impossible even in times of peace, let alone when a strong enemy has already entered the country.</p>
<p>2.  Speaking of Resistance Now is Like Locking the Stable After the Horse is Gone</p>
<p>The enemy wants to gradually erode our country, occupying a place today and cutting off a city tomorrow, using the excuse of security and talking about peace. They also declare to the world that "China is not a modern country and has no modern organization," so it can be cut off at will. If we only talk about resistance, we lack a whole and planned organization and only use the force of a local part to resist the enemy's entire army. The number of wins and losses is not something that needs to be divined.</p>
<p>Moreover, the three northeastern provinces are the richest in East Asia. In a single day, we actually lost them. Even if we try to preserve everything and crave peace, the enemy will send out iron cavalry to attack cities and seize land. Jinzhou has already been lost, and the land of the key pass of Jiujiang is also in danger. If we continue to be trapped here, how can we save ourselves? The enemy deceives us that our strength is weak and will definitely compromise to seek reconciliation. They do not know that the more we seek temporary preservation and hope for peace, the more the enemy will advance and attack fiercely. Even if we let them run rampant, we may not be able to achieve peace.</p>
<p>For example, the statement issued by the Japanese army authorities on December 23 last year regarding our country's Third Plenary Session not only disregarded international friendship but also went to the extreme of insults. The concluding words said, "The first means to maintain peace in the Far East at the present is to liquidate the extremely dangerous Chinese Kuomintang and its foreign policy." These words are even worse than the phrase "drink horses in Wu Mountain". Can we endure to the end and only talk about resistance?</p>
<p>3.  The Meaning of Struggle</p>
<p>Our country has been weak for a long time. However, it has a vast territory and a large population, and it is richly endowed by nature. If there is active leadership, turning defeat into victory is not difficult. The enemy's national strength is exhausted. Judging from the national budget of 2.23 billion yen for this year alone, they cannot afford it. The accumulation of its national debt has reached 10 billion yen. If they increase their troops to China again, each increase of a division will add at least 30 million yen in military expenses. For a formal war against China, if they send 100 divisions, the annual cost will be at least 5 billion yen. With the enemy's current national strength, they will deplete one-twentieth of their national wealth in one year. Even if they win the war, they will undoubtedly be the second Germany after the European war.</p>
<p>Taking the lessons of the January 28 Shanghai War as an example, we were able to fight the enemy for as long as thirty-two days with inferior forces and defeated weapons. If we have a whole plan and full mobilization, even if the national defense is completely lacking and the fortresses are completely lost, we can make great sacrifices and fight the enemy for five or ten years. Then we will have the surplus strength, and the enemy will die on its own. From afar, like Napoleon's invasion of Russia, and more recently, like the six Japanese divisions' invasion of Siberia, the Russians did not talk about resistance, but only strove to fight, causing the enemy to retreat due to internal frustration, and thus consolidating their national foundation. Moreover, in today's situation, so-called justice must have strength in order to be able to implement what it says. If the forces between countries are not equal, then there is no justice to speak of. Justice is something that changes with strength. If you want to strengthen your country's power, you must actively struggle.</p>
<p>4.  The Future of Struggle and the Realization of Reality</p>
<p>The reason why Japan dares to inch forward and continue to invade us is that it deceives our people and has no spirit of struggle. If we can truly mobilize the entire country and rise up in a battle, and strive for the national revolutionary spirit and struggle for a hundred years of history, then how can the enemy, which is like the setting sun in the west, engage in a protracted war? The past events of Alsace-Lorraine being cut off can be learned. The hatred of Poland's subjugation and territorial division has been avenged. We have a land area of 3,444,300 square miles and a population of over 400 million. If we struggle desperately, how can the enemy own the Northeast region?</p>
<p>Moreover, the undisguised aggression of Japanese imperialism has aroused the conflict of interests among capitalist countries. Once they wage war against us, the 300 million yen of exports to China will be completely cut off, and the import of over 200 million yuan of industrial raw materials will be severely affected. In addition, with the expenditure of huge military expenses, how can its extremely poor people bear it?</p>
<p>Therefore, China today, if it wants to establish a nation and survive, should not deal with things superficially again, engage in passive and inactive resistance, and grow the enemy's arrogance. The urgent task at present is to have an accurate understanding of reality. Do not be overly afraid of the enemy's military power. Rise up and make a national struggle to the death. Only struggle can achieve survival. Only struggle can protect our nation. The great disaster is now before us, and the catastrophe is close at hand. We can endure no more and concede no more. An urgent struggle is the only way out.</p>

<p>Large Factories Converted into Arms Factories</p>
<p>Industrial Plans Slightly Delayed</p>
<p>(Moscow) When the plenary session of the Central Executive Committee of the Communist Party opened on Saturday, Stalin gave a fiery speech. The contents were not released until tonight, generally saying that the war crisis in the Far East forced the Soviet Russia to convert several large factories into military factories to prepare for contingencies. Therefore, the production in the last year of the Five-Year Plan will inevitably be delayed. However, the Soviet Russia now has the latest weapons to cope with unexpected events. Although Stalin did not explicitly mention Japan, he said that the Soviet Russia had to change several factories because a certain neighboring country refused to sign a non-aggression treaty. The neighboring country he mentioned was obviously Japan. Stalin also said that our factories will soon become factories that produce national defense equipment. The country is now ready to cope with all war dangers. The initial war crisis forced us to develop heavy industry at an extremely rapid pace. Today, we have the preparation to resist attacks, and this heavy industry can be slightly slowed down in the second five years. In the past, the Soviet Russia could be said to have no self-defense. Today, it can actually provide the Red Army with the most sophisticated defense equipment without limitation. (9th National Electricity)</p>

The protest first stated that the Japanese military police had deliberately blown up their barracks in advance in an attempt to shirk responsibility, and although the Japanese representative had made various promises to the League of Nations, the Shanhaiguan incident was a predetermined plan by Japan to increase the severity of the situation. Finally, it demanded that the Japanese army immediately withdraw from Shanhaiguan and take necessary measures to prevent similar incidents from happening again. As for the Japanese who took the opportunity to cause disturbances, they should also be punished. China reserves the right to claim compensation for damages. (9th Havas Electricity)</p>

<p>League of Nations' Aid to Japan Could Lead to Peace</p>
<p>Supporting China is Tantamount to Encouraging Chaos</p>
<p>Milan - When Japanese Chief Delegate to the League of Nations, Yosuke Matsuoka, passed through Milan (Italy), he met with journalists and declared that Japan's views remained unchanged. Geneva should know what to choose between China and Japan. Assisting Japan could achieve peace, while assisting China would only fuel chaos and could lead to a global catastrophe. A large portion of Japanese public opinion opposes Japan being a member of the League of Nations, because the United States and Soviet Russia are not members, and Japan has no interests within it. Matsuoka concluded that Europeans do not understand the reasons for Japan's actions in China. (Havas Agency dispatch from January 9th)</p>
<p>Rome - The Japanese representative Matsuoka, currently touring Italy, spoke to reporters today, outlining Japan's attitude towards the League of Nations. He stated that Japan's main purpose in the League has not been changed by the recent conflict. Manchuria is an independent nation, and at the appropriate time, with Japan's assistance, has the complete right to demand independence. Japan staying in the League does not offer particular advantages, because Japan is between Russia and the United States, and neither of those countries are members of the League of Nations. Japanese public opinion is leaning towards opposing Japan's continued membership in the League, but those holding this view are still in the minority. (Reuters dispatch from January 9th)</p>

<p>Declaring War on Japan is Not Yet Timely</p>
<p>丨Talks by Wang Jingwei丨</p>
<p>(Berlin) Mr. Wang Jingwei, who has been receiving treatment for his liver ailment in Tubingen, Southern Germany, met with journalists today and gave a statement. According to him, China is not currently considering formally declaring war on Japan, because since the Xinhai Revolution, Japan has never forgotten how to weaken China day by day. China's current position is still not strong enough, and therefore not sufficient to declare war on Japan. However, China should strive to resist Japan's humiliation. This requires moral support from the great powers. Mr. Wang also stated that the best effect of Japan's aggression is to eliminate domestic divisions in China and to unite the country to resist foreign enemies. Even though his and Chiang Kai-shek's political views differ, the distinction between so-called democratic politics and military dictatorship has been put aside. Today, the only premise is how to unite to save the country and resist Japan. (National News Agency dispatch from January 9th)</p>

<h3 id="e64">Japanese Imperialism's War Preparations Mania <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>Land, Sea, and Air Forces Preparing for Large-Scale Maneuvers to Threaten the US and Russia</p>
<p>Nationwide Mobilization Plan Even Extends to Dogs and Horses</p>
<p>Special Dispatch from China United Press, Tokyo - Japanese imperialism's current war preparations have reached a state of intense mania. Last year, the land, sea, and air forces held several unprecedented large-scale exercises. Extending into this year, the Japanese land and naval authorities, recognizing the urgency of the war crisis, are preparing to conduct various more important special maneuvers. The special maneuvers, which are held annually, have decided that the Kanazawa and other nine divisions, the Zentsuji Eleventh Division, and a mixed brigade will participate, and will be held in the Fukui Prefecture area. The Hokuriku region, including Ishikawa, Fukui, and Toyama, faces the Soviet Union across the Sea of Japan. Therefore, these maneuvers are of particularly important significance for attacking the Soviet Union. Before these maneuvers, it has been decided to hold special air force maneuvers. This air force unit is filled with content by exploiting money from the broad masses of laborers under the false pretense of patriotic donations. Japanese imperialism uses this money to expand and improve its new-style killing aviation weapons, preparing to further sacrifice the blood of the toiling masses and attack and slaughter the toiling masses of other countries. The participating units in the special air force maneuvers have decided to use six aircraft squadrons, six flight schools, one anti-aircraft artillery unit, and 400 aircraft, in the central and northern regions of Shizuoka and Aichi, in addition to the Sixth Regiment in Pyongyang, Korea. At the same time, on the naval side, various new-style warships, aircraft, etc. have been completed, and it has been decided to conduct unprecedented large-scale naval exercises in the South Sea Islands and Ogasawara Islands area for approximately one month in June this year. The main active weapons are naval aircraft, new-style cruisers, submarines, etc. The purpose is to spy on the Soviet Union, further divide China, and at the same time target American imperialism, which goes without saying. After American imperialism concentrated its fleet in the Pacific and held naval maneuvers, it did not disperse the fleet, but kept it concentrated in one place. Japanese imperialism's naval maneuvers are clearly intended to demonstrate force to American imperialism.</p>
<p>On the army side, in order to attack the Soviet Union and further divide China, from December 19th to 22nd last year, it convened a secret meeting of 260 battalion commanders, group secretaries, etc., from infantry, cavalry, artillery, flight corps, regiment commanders, engineer corps, transport corps, heavy artillery independent battalions across the country, and decided on a major reform of the troops. In order to implement national mobilization, the military mobilized retired soldiers, youth training center students, youth league members, and female youth league members nationwide, and investigated: ㈠ the operational processes of the 30-year plan for military administration, ㈡ changes in horse production resources, ㈢ the progress of horse improvement, ㈣ facilities related to horses and their effects. On November 29th, they implemented horse purchases nationwide in unison, compiling them for military use. Dogs were also trained for military use. Lieutenant General Oshima Yoshimasa is the president of the "Imperial Military Dog Association," and training centers have been established in Toyama and Yoyogi to carry out the breeding, training, and propagation of various military working dogs, as well as to implement the registration of improved dog breeds and pedigree certification. The nationwide mobilization plan extends to dogs and horses. The scale and thoroughness of the plan are such as this.</p>
<p>The Japanese imperialists' efforts to prepare for a major war have reached a fever pitch. An unprecedented war to attack the Soviet Union, divide China, and massacre the laboring masses is becoming increasingly imminent, advocating youthful war thought.</p>

<p>At a quarter past eleven, nineteen surviving veteran soldiers from the Sino-Japanese and Russo-Japanese Wars arrived at the Takasaki Regiment to undergo training. They were all between 50 and 70 years old. The Japanese military's move is because the working class and farmers recently have been unwilling to make uncompensated sacrifices for the warlords and plutocrats, so they have no choice but to rely on the remaining authority of the elderly to encourage the youth, in order to promote war thought. (China United Press dispatch from Tokyo on the 10th)</p>
<p>Utilizing the Theory of the Five Elements: Japanese warlords, aware of the increasing disaffection and anti-war sentiment among the people recently, are banning all anti-war speech or news exposing the chaos in Manchuria in order to salvage this crisis. This is a passive form of resistance. On the other hand, they are seeking opportunities to propagate that the Japanese army always wins every battle, that the territory expands gradually after the war, and that the Japanese bear the mission of governing Asia, to anesthetize the masses. Today, they invited Vice Admiral Ogasawara to give a speech at the Atagoyama Central Broadcasting Station, using the theory of the Five Elements and the Eight Trigrams Yin and Yang to say that Showa 8 is the year of Japan's fourth victory, and that the people must step up their efforts, to deceive the people with superstition. The Central Broadcasting Station ordered 22 broadcasting stations across the country to relay the speech to various places.</p>

<p>The Realization of a Political Party Cabinet is Absolutely Impossible</p>
<p>It is Expected that Power Will Inevitably Fall into the Hands of the Military Faction</p>
<p>World News Agency said that the current Saito Cabinet in Japan, which is in a state of emergency, is under attack from both the political parties and the military factions, and its downfall is only a matter of time. According to the development of the situation, it can be determined that those who will seize power in the near future will be a military cabinet. Among the military faction, there are four people who are most likely to form a cabinet in the future: General Ugaki Kazushige, the Governor-General of Korea; Hirnuma Kiichirō, who holds the important position of Vice-President of the Privy Council; Uchida Kōsai, the Foreign Minister known for his tough diplomacy; and Araki Sadao, the Minister of the Army.</p>

<p>National News Agency dispatch from Washington on the 9th: The U.S. Treasury Department must promptly issue a huge amount of public bonds to cover government debt. However, in order to ensure the smooth issuance in the current economic situation, it is necessary to balance the budget first. Therefore, the U.S. President will send a special report to Congress tomorrow, urging it to balance the budget immediately. As for the amount of public bonds, the U.S. Treasury Department has not yet announced it. It is said that it will be the largest amount in recent years, because in addition to making up for the treasury deficit, there is also a huge amount of old debt that will be due soon and must be repaid by issuing new bonds.</p>
<h3 id="e70">Second Meeting of the World Economic Preparatory Committee <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>Havas dispatch from Geneva on the 9th: The committee of experts responsible for preparing for the World Economic and Monetary Conference held its second meeting today. The Chinese government sent observer Luo Jun to attend. American experts suggested that experts from various participating countries can discuss economic issues that have political difficulties, but war debt issues should be excluded. In the afternoon at 4:00, the committee reopened a non-public meeting. British expert Sir Frederick Leith-Ross, the Chief Economic Advisor to the Government, was rather pessimistic, saying that there is no way to restore the countries that have had to abandon the gold standard, and that countries that have not abandoned the gold standard may also have to abandon it. He also said that the power to control the economy can be entrusted to the state, and that the same can be done with currency. Leith-Ross requested: ㈠ Thoroughly resolve the war debt issue; ㈡ Stabilize currency values; ㈢ Remove various obstacles to commerce, such as limiting the quantity of imports and banning imports; ㈣ Allocate a type of funding to raise the wholesale prices of goods. American expert Williams raised objections to the order of Leith-Ross's proposals, but did not adopt a hostile attitude towards Leith-Ross's inclusion of the war debt issue in the proposals. Williams claimed that last year the United States attempted to artificially raise prices, but the results of the experiment failed. He also said that the United States has always maintained the gold standard. French expert Lister claimed that before the war debt and private debt issues are resolved, the convocation of the World Economic Conference is actually useless. The British representative's fourth request, advocating the establishment of an international common fund as suggested by the Stresa Conference, was considered satisfactory by Lister, but he also opposed artificially raising prices. He also said that France ultimately intends to maintain the gold standard no matter what.</p>

Looking from the neighboring island, the fire was very fierce. It is said that the fort was the newest type and was recently built, requiring a huge amount of money. Rumors say that the disaster was due to a political conspiracy, which has made people even more nervous.</p>

<h3 id="e80">Temporary Ceasefire After the Fall of Yuguan <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>= He Zhuguo Resists to Show His Heart =</p>
<p>= Xiong Xiling Organizes Local Association =</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: The Japanese army occupied the county seat of Linyu, and the front line stopped on the east bank of the Shi River. Our army is defending on the west bank, forming a confrontational situation. Our army has not counterattacked, and the enemy has not advanced westward. There are only intermittent gunshots every day. On the night of the 5th, it was suddenly reported that the Japanese army had retreated. After investigation, it was found that the Suzuki Brigade had departed north of Yucheng, and the defenses of Yuguan, which were vacated, and the Kawara Brigade had not yet arrived, thus presenting the appearance of an empty city. Because the enemy had already seen through that our army had no courage to counterattack, they played this trick. The purpose of the Suzuki Brigade's advance to the north seems to be to first attack the 9th Brigade headquarters at Jiumenkou and Shimenzhai, and then advance north to Laoye Temple to attack the base of the Liaoxi National Salvation Army, hoping to echo the enemy at Chaoyang Temple, and then attack Rehe. If this observation is correct, the enemy will still follow the Beining Road westward to contain our army supporting Rehe. It is rumored that the Japanese army is conducting a partial settlement, but Zhang Zidian denied it to Beijing. It is reported that on December 8, the enemy fired 38 shells at Yuguan, and then it was resolved peacefully. As for how it was resolved, our side declared that it was a misunderstanding and explained it away. Japan suddenly sent a telegram to Geneva, describing the settlement of the Yuguan incident, the main points of which are as follows: ㈠ The incident was a misunderstanding, and the Chinese military authorities apologized to the Japanese army in writing; ㈡ The Manchurian police have the right to station troops in Yuguan; ㈢ The Chinese troops stationed in Yuguan will protect the activities of the Japanese garrison. The Japanese delegation then forwarded this to the League of Nations Executive Council for filing. Our country's representatives Yan Huqing and Gu Weijun were extremely ashamed and indignant upon hearing the news. However, they did not know if it was true, so they telegraphed Nanjing to inquire with the national government. At that time, it happened to be during the Third Plenary Session of the Kuomintang, and some people advocated severe punishment. He Zhuguo had nothing to say, and angrily went to Ping to resign. Zhang tried to persuade him to stay, but He claimed illness and entered the hospital, indicating that he would no longer return to defend. Unexpectedly, the Japanese army had another provocation on New Year's Day, and He was ordered to return to defend. Therefore, he decided to resist to show his heart. When the war became tense, He telegraphed the nearby 囗囗 Brigade to request reinforcements, but the brigade seemed to refuse. Therefore, two days after the fall of the city, reinforcements arrived on the west bank of the Shi River. However, He's short-term resistance has won the sympathy of the people of North China. In addition to sending telegrams to express condolences to the anti-Japanese soldiers of the 9th Brigade, all sectors of Pingjin are starting to raise comfort goods to encourage them.</p>
<p>It is difficult to predict whether the Yucheng incident can be resolved peacefully and whether the enemy can stop expanding military operations. However, Pingjin, as the business and cultural center of North China, has long been noticed by the enemy. A few days ago, Xiong Xiling came to Tianjin from Ping and invited leaders of the city's chamber of commerce, banking association, charitable organizations, and national salvation organizations yesterday afternoon to discuss ways to maintain local security. The general decisions were: ㈠ The city's chamber of commerce, banking association, and autonomous organizations will jointly organize the Tianjin Local Association. Xiong explained that there was a local maintenance association organization during the civil wars in the Pingjin area in the past. This time, it is a war against foreign aggression, so the name has been changed to association. The tasks undertaken by this association are to stabilize finance, provide disaster relief, and find ways to prevent the city from suffering from war; ㈡ Various national salvation organizations, the city party headquarters, and various labor unions will unite to form a large organization (the name is still undecided) to be responsible for propaganda, fundraising, and collecting comfort goods. Various student organizations can also join the work; ㈢ The Red Swastika Society, the Red Cross Society, the Yellow Cross Society, the White Swastika Society, charitable relief organizations, and other groups will unite to form a group (the name has not been determined) to be responsible for rescuing wounded soldiers on the front line, war refugees, establishing rear hospitals, establishing shelters, and purchasing medical supplies. Xiong further explained that a huge amount of money is needed to establish rear hospitals and shelters, and we should find ways to do so as soon as possible. The location of their establishment should be far away from Pingjin, hundreds of miles away in a place with convenient transportation. Pingjin can only set up temporary reception centers to change dressings and apply medicine to the wounded and to provide food and drink to refugees. The above three measures are the predetermined outline, and the responsible organizations will convene meetings to study the detailed organization. (January 8)</p>
<h3 id="e81">The Chaotic Situation in Jilin <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>(Japanese Suppressive Policies)</p>
<p>(Combining Force and Deviousness)</p>
<p>Since the Japanese traitor Mutō took office in Jilin, he has changed his policy of solely relying on forceful suppression. He now also employs insidious methods of division. The following is a summary of the key aspects:</p>
<p>㈠ Recruiting and Surrendering Righteous Armies:  Since mid-December of last year, the Japanese traitors in various counties and towns have widely posted notices to recruit and accept the surrender of our righteous armies.  The Jilin Municipal Garrison Commander, Ji Xing, and Xi Qia put their names to these notices, stating that anyone surrendering a large rifle would receive 30 national currency units, a small rifle 20 units, and surrendering empty-handed would earn 10 units.  After surrendering their weapons, each person would be given a "Good Citizen Certificate" and those desiring service would be considered for enrollment.</p>
<p>㈡ Policies of Recruiting and Surrendering: The policies of recruiting and surrendering generally employed a method of starting from nearby areas and extending to more distant ones.  Counties in the hinterland of Jilin, such as Yitong, Yushu, Shulan, Shuangcheng, Acheng, Panshi, Dehui, Changchun, Yongji, etc., and various locations along the railway lines initially had righteous armies everywhere in mid-August of last year.  Now, there is not a single trace of them left.</p>
<p>㈢ The Vicious Tactic of "Catching the King to Catch the Thieves": The Japanese traitors, after incorporating our righteous armies, would offer small favors to the soldiers to trick them into surrendering their weapons. The leaders would then be falsely accused of crimes, put to death, or secretly assassinated to eliminate future troubles. Those who have died include Lin Zhonghao, Sanjianghao, Xiaoshuangsheng, Chang Zuo, Wu Deng, etc.</p>
<p>㈣ The Recent Conditions of Our Righteous Armies: Except for the major righteous armies led by Wang Delin and Ding Li, which have received some limited assistance, most of the other smaller units in Jilin have been fighting for years. They are severely lacking in weapons, ammunition, and clothing.  In this severe winter, either trapped by the terrain or facing overwhelming odds, their strategies are: 1) Bury the weapons and scatter, waiting for an opportunity; 2) Falsely surrender and bide their time.</p>
<p>㈤ The Japanese Traitors' Method of Confiscating Weapons:  Recently, they have become even more malicious.  Those who surrender are repeatedly reorganized, and each reorganization results in numerous reductions, with the goal of collecting all the firearms scattered among the people.</p>
<p>㈥ The Pseudo-General Zhang Haipeng Seizes the Highest Military Authority in the Puppet State: Most of the important officials under him are his sons and nephews. The various regiments stationed in Jilin each have their own agendas.  The concept of the nation and ethnicity is deeply rooted in them. Moreover, many of the smaller units of the Jilin righteous armies are defectors from his command.  Whenever they are ordered to suppress our righteous armies, they often raise their rifles and shoot high, which is known as "shooting the friend's gun."  What is most commendable is that his troops do not have a fixed number; our righteous armies can freely enter and leave, making it a haven for our righteous armies to escape.  The recent sudden increase of tens of thousands of soldiers in Zhang's army illustrates this general situation.</p>
<p>㈦ The Entire Province of Jilin is in Utter Chaos: Last year, except for important cities and towns such as the provincial capital Changchun, our righteous armies occupied almost every other place.  Under this sudden change and turmoil, order is extremely difficult to maintain; it can truly be called a living hell.</p>
<p>㈧ To this day, there is still unharvested grain in the counties of Jilin, left to feed cattle and livestock.  Most of the houses and dwellings have been burned down. Old people, parents, wives, and children are scattered.  Vitality is depleted.  Famine is feared this year.</p>
<p>㈨ Under this sudden change, the general public, amid severe social terror, mostly lack a thorough understanding.  They tend to believe it is a time of tribulation and fate.  For a time, heresies are rampant.  Such thoughts fill their empty minds, a truly pitiful situation.</p>
<p>㈩ In various religious rural villages, bankruptcy has reached an extreme. Initially, due to panic, people then sought various ways out.  The fear of material life is irremediable, and spiritual comfort naturally arises.  For a time, organizations such as the Big Sword Society, Yellow Sand Society, Red Spear Society, and Ruyi Sect are everywhere; there is no one without a society, no one without a sect.  Chanting incantations and practicing vegetarianism, doctrines and Buddhist principles are spreading throughout the province.</p>
<h3 id="e82">A Tale of Blood and Tears from the Northeast <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>Report from Beiping: The loss of the Northeast has now been fifteen months. What is the internal situation in the Northeast now? Because the Japanese are covering things up and not revealing the truth, we have no way of knowing. What we do know comes from newspaper reports with fragmentary accounts, or from the casual talk of people returning from the Northeast. These are incomplete and it is difficult to get an overview. The reporter believes that one cannot see the true picture of things without an on-the-spot investigation. I braved difficulties to go to the Northeast, staying there for four months. I am now writing down what I have heard and seen, and report it to the nation.</p>
<h3 id="e83">(Factions within the Puppet State) <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>The puppet Manchurian state was created by the Japanese. Although it appears to be united, internally there are various factions. ㈠ The Restoration Faction: Led by Zheng Xiaoxu and supported by Puyi as its head. Although the Japanese are using Puyi to build the puppet state, Puyi also wants to use the puppet state as a stepping stone for restoration, to fulfill his imperial dreams. Zheng Xiaoxu has always been a key figure in the restoration plot, so he is naturally in cahoots with Puyi. However, the Japanese are quite suspicious of him. ㈠ The Concordia Association Faction: Jointly organized by Zhao Xinbo and others with the Japanese. Zhao and others have always been the most ardent pro-Japanese figures, so they organized this association with the Japanese, with the aim of promoting pro-Japanese sentiments and loyalty to the puppet state of Manchuria. Its mission is to promote the essence of the puppet state's founding and implement the Wangdao (Benevolent Rule) ideology. Japanese, Manchus, and Mongols can all freely join. The intention is nothing more than to curry favor with the Japanese and secure their positions and wealth. Therefore, the Japanese appear to be quite sympathetic to this faction. Like birds nesting on a dangerous curtain, not knowing what tomorrow brings, they are happily congratulating themselves, thinking they have succeeded. Living in a drunken dream, these puppets are the epitome of this.</p>
<h3 id="e84">(Anatomy of a Puppet) <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>Why are the Northeast puppets willing to act as puppets for the Japanese, enduring the scorn of the people without shame? Aside from a few who willingly betray the country, the rest are due to the following two reasons:</p>
<p>1. Since the September 18th Incident, ordinary unsuccessful figures in the opposition have all been recruited by the Japanese, given official titles, and promoted to serve as a rallying force. Since these people now have official positions, they temporarily ignore everything else. Those who crave official positions are also willing to be co-opted by the Japanese to seek temporary wealth.</p>
<p>2. Their personal lives and property are entirely in the hands of the Japanese. If they show the slightest dissent, the Japanese will confiscate their property on some pretext, and even their lives are not guaranteed. For the sake of their personal lives and property, the general public has no choice but to endure humiliation and accept the Japanese shackles.</p>
<p>In short, it is nothing more than a desire for temporary peace, and it is not a genuine willingness to work for the Japanese. Fortunately, the Japanese hold the power, and do not need the puppets to meddle too much. The Japanese see the puppets as nothing more than a kind of decoration. Therefore, these puppets only know to say yes and nod, doing nothing. They are officials in name only, in reality they are like straw men. As for ordinary lower-level civil and military officials, they are even more bored. These lower-level officials have no direct relationship with the Japanese, and there is no question of being pro-Japanese or anti-Japanese. They go to work and clock in every day, and receive their salaries on time every month, taking being an official as a profession and eating as a job. Other than that, there is nothing else. I once asked them why they did not go to Guannei (the area south of the Great Wall) to make a living. They replied that it was not easy to make a living in Guannei. Friends had gone to Beiping to wait for a job for half a year, and their funds had run out, but they still had not obtained a position. It was better to live in relative peace here, so they did not want to go to Guannei. From this, we can see that most of the officials in the puppet state are not really betraying the country, but are forced to endure humiliation for self-preservation.</p>
<h3 id="e85">(The Psychology of the People in the Northeast) <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>Although the Japanese have created a puppet state by pretending to represent the will of the people of the Northeast, the anti-Japanese sentiment of the people of the Northeast has not been submerged as a result. Observing the repeated efforts of the righteous armies in various places, braving the hail of bullets and fighting the Japanese with flesh and blood, we can know that the hearts of the people have not died, and there is a trend of becoming more and more激昂due to the Japanese oppression. For this reason, the Japanese are quite wary of the people of the Northeast. On the one hand, they use force to eliminate the righteous armies in various places, and on the other hand, they use their seductive tricks on the unarmed people in places like PanYang. They levy our national taxes, lend them to the farmers, and also summarily abolish one or two small miscellaneous taxes to ingratiate themselves with the general public. In the Shenyang area, theaters do not sell tickets, allowing villagers to enter and watch for free, and after watching, each person is given a bag of biscuits, hoping to use these small favors to buy out the entire anti-Japanese psychology of our people. However, if our people show the slightest anti-Japanese will, the disaster of death will immediately follow. Therefore, the people of the Northeast are well aware of this situation. The anti-Japanese sentiment is growing stronger and stronger. When the righteous armies approached Shenyang in mid-August of this year, the people were overjoyed, secretly congratulating each other, hoping that the righteous armies would come quickly and restore our homeland. Although the Japanese have tried every means to anesthetize the people, the people's hope for the government to recover the lost territories is even more urgent than that of the people in Guannei. The hearts of the people have not died. It all depends on our efforts. The country is not necessarily beyond saving.</p>
<h3 id="e86">(Glimpses of the Actions of the Japanese Army) <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>On the one hand, the Japanese are using various methods to seduce the people and eliminate their rebellious psychology. On the other hand, they are carrying out cruel massacres against those who are unyielding. We have already reported some of these facts in the newspapers. The usual abuse of the people is even too numerous to record. Here is a brief record of one or two:</p>
<p>(1) The people of the Northeast have completely lost their freedom of movement today. When walking on the road, if they encounter the Japanese army, they are often stopped and searched. If the villagers are slightly hesitant in their words due to fear, they are immediately branded as plotting something wrong and suspected of being anti-Japanese. They are not allowed to argue, and are even ordered to dig their own graves on the spot and be buried alive in them.</p>
<p>(2) The Japanese army frequently invades shops and residences at any time, arbitrarily searching. If any books promoting anti-Japanese sentiments and the Three Principles of the People, or printed with the words "Republic of China," are found, they are immediately branded as reactionary and arrested and imprisoned. The textbooks used in the various elementary schools have all been reviewed by the Japanese, and all nationalistic thoughts have been swept away. Zhongda University is almost unable to open.</p>
<p>(3) In the spring and summer of last year, the Japanese, under the pretext of epidemic prevention, forced people to inject vaccinations. After the injection, the skin at the injection site immediately bulged up and turned blue, taking a week to flatten.</p>
<p>(4) The Japanese army often uses the pretext of suppressing bandits to carry out massacres everywhere, often burning entire villages and towns to the ground, leaving no chickens or dogs alive. In fact, the bandits the Japanese call bandits are all our loyal and brave volunteer army. The Japanese are especially afraid of the volunteer army. Therefore, initially, the scope of the Japanese army's activities did not extend beyond the railway lines. Now, the strength of the volunteer army has been declining, and the footprints of the Japanese can be found in all the important towns and cities. The people of the Northeast have suffered greatly from the Japanese army's abuse. Those who are generally unarmed and unbrave are forced to commit suicide as a family, or to move their entire families to Guannei. The boats and vehicles are endless on the road, abandoning everything and leaving. Crying from hunger and cold, they are experiencing the extreme of human suffering. But this still refers to those who have some financial resources. The majority of poor people have no ability to escape, and can only allow the Japanese army to trample on them, or sell their sons and daughters to make travel expenses. The misery is even more unbearable to describe.</p>
<h3 id="e87">(The Views Held by Foreigners) <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>The newspapers and periodicals in the Northeast now are all monopolized by the Japanese. We who live there can never know the truth about the situation. The news about the righteous armies is even more strongly tabooed. What we can see are only one or two Western newspapers sent from outside. The Westerners who stay in the Northeast, with a little bit of fair judgment, are mostly dissatisfied with what the Japanese are doing. I once lived in the home of a Western friend, and they often mocked the Japanese as a form of entertainment. In their eyes, the Japanese are only worth one savage kind of person. But there are also those who speak for the Japanese. I once remembered a Western newspaper commentary saying that the Chinese national character is really a lazy nation. The methods adopted by the Japanese to deal with this kind of lazy nation are very proper. If these methods were transferred to any Western nation, there would probably be no peace for a single day. Although their words are absurd and outrageous, why are we being slandered to this point? Thinking about it, we can cry deeply. Fellow countrymen, for decades, we have been saying every day that the country is about to perish. Now the time of national demise has arrived. If we don't wake up now, it will be too late for regret. Please look at the people of the Northeast today. They are the example of our future. As I write this, my tears are already streaming down. Is China really beyond saving? Please see our future efforts. (January 3rd)</p>
<p>Guangdong Province's Three-Year Military Plan</p>
<h3 id="e88">Matters Concerning National Defense Have Been Announced <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>Report from Guangzhou: The Guangdong Provincial authorities have formulated a three-year governance plan. Regarding rectification, there are three items: officialdom, finance, and education. Regarding construction, there are four items: politics, economy, transportation, and education. Regarding military affairs, a three-year plan has also been drafted, which will be implemented starting on New Year's Day this year. The content of this plan, except for those not to be announced, includes the following excerpt from the section on national defense:</p>
<p>(Air Force) The first year's work includes: ㈠ All counties in the province purchase civilian aircraft and organize militia aviation; ㈡ Construct various aviation buildings; ㈢ Train aviation talent; ㈣ Increase the number of national defense aircraft squadrons; ㈤ Complete aircraft fields and aviation stations in all counties of the province, etc. In the second and third years, they will engage in training aircraft tactics and actively expanding combat aircraft, with a minimum target of over 150 aircraft, to consolidate air defense in South China. Regarding the economic aspect, in addition to promoting the sale of aviation prize bonds, they will find other ways to raise funds when necessary.</p>
<p>(Navy) In the first year, increase the number of river and sea defense warships by several tons, and strictly train the Marine Corps to become an elite force. In the second and third years, they will engage in purchasing artillery and machinery.</p>
<p>(Army) There will be no changes to the existing organizational structure. In the first year: ㈠ Save military expenses; ㈡ Eliminate inferior soldiers and retain the good ones in each unit to reduce the burden; ㈢ Improve training methods; ㈣ Rectify military preparations, etc. In the second and third years, they will engage in a policy of soldiers and farmers. As the local police teams are well-established, there is no need to station many troops in each county. When there is no war, the troops will be used for reclamation. When there is war, they will be transferred for national defense. The various Pacification Commissioner's offices have already begun planning model forestry centers, which is the first step in this plan. (January 3rd)</p>
<p>Guangdong Province Opposes the Establishment of Customs Branch Stations</p>
<h3 id="e89">Guangdong Provincial Government Orders All Customs Not to Establish Them <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<h3 id="e90">Pointing Out That It Conflicts with the Abolition of Likin Tax <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: The Ministry of Finance recently ordered the customs in Guangdong Province to establish more branch stations, and listed the names of the locations where branch stations and offices should be added, informing the Guangdong Provincial Government for its information. It is heard that after receiving the order, the Guangdong Provincial Government believed that it was difficult to implement the establishment of branch stations everywhere, and submitted it to the Southwest Political Affairs Conference for a resolution to not allow their establishment. The Provincial Government also issued a clear order to all Customs Superintendents yesterday, stating, "Upon review, the Provincial Government's 151st meeting of the Sixth Committee, proposed by the Chairman, holds that the original intent of the National Government's abolition of Likin tax was to develop domestic industry and commerce and to rectify national finances. Repeatedly, through three orders and five injunctions, all Likin taxes and all taxes similar to Likin throughout the country should be abolished, especially the customs stations that implement these harsh and detailed miscellaneous taxes should be closed, so as to avoid industry and commerce being restricted by excessive demands and delays, to alleviate their suffering, and to maintain the people's livelihood. The intention is excellent. As a result, the whole country has followed suit and the people have praised it. However, upon examining the Ministry of Finance's notice received on the 15th of this month, stating that according to the Inspector General of Customs, Mr. F.W. Maze's proposal for reorganizing the coastal branch stations of the Customs, the proposed branch stations and offices are appropriate for local conditions and convenient for control, and are considered feasible, and requesting a review, etc. Upon reviewing the attached list of various branch stations and offices, many are located inland, which seems to contradict the regulations for abolishing the fifty-mile regular customs within the abolition of Likin case. I am afraid that after implementation, it will be difficult to ensure that there will be no actions that harm the country and the people. Taking a step back, if the established branch stations and offices are not tax collection agencies, but only perform inspection duties, then their harassment can be predicted. Moreover, the Customs can only inspect at ports, but now they are encroaching on the interior, which is even more inappropriate. The reason for abolishing Likin taxes to benefit the people will instead incur popular resentment. The reason for alleviating the people's suffering will only increase the people's suffering. Although it is said that they are adapting to local conditions and convenient for control, such reversals will damage the nation's credibility, and national policies will fail. We must consider it carefully. It seems that we should reply to the Ministry of Finance and request cancellation, whether it is appropriate to wait for public decision and other words. While the discussion was ongoing, Lin Yizhong, Director of the Guangdong Department of Civil Affairs, presented a report stating, 'Your subordinate, the Director, this time, when inspecting the southern route, passed through Suixi County and the three customs branch stations of Mazhang, Chengyue, and Shentang along the county's highway. Because the county is adjacent to Chikan, and the highways are mostly connected to it, merchants transporting smuggled goods and evading taxes is common. Each of these branch stations, after 6:00 PM, must block the road at each station's location with wooden barriers. All passing vehicles must stop and wait for inspection. Their execution of duties, to prevent smuggling, seems to be appropriate. However, once the road is blocked, the vehicles that arrive must first pay a handling fee of three or four yuan before being released. Otherwise, they will use inspections as an excuse, delaying and obstructing them, even for dozens of minutes before they can pass. Even the daytime inspection procedures require the driver to personally enter the card officer's room to inquire and fill in who is riding in the car, how many people, etc., which takes at least fifteen minutes. This seems like an inspection that should be handled, but such harassment is no different from collecting road tolls, and it greatly hinders road traffic. Local people are complaining, and travelers and merchants are lamenting. The Director has witnessed this kind of malfeasance, harming merchants and the people, and cannot remain silent. It is appropriate to prepare a document and submit it to Your Excellency for review. I implore you to forward it to the Southwest Political Affairs Committee, ordering the Customs to instruct each of these branch stations to conduct inspections quickly in the future and not to collect fees, in order to eliminate the malfeasance and benefit transportation, etc.' Based on this, it was immediately submitted for review, and it was resolved to order the Customs Superintendents not to establish branch stations, and report it to the Southwest Political Affairs Committee for review, and inform the Ministry of Finance for its information, and separately inform the Pacification Commissioner's Offices in each district and the magistrates in each county. Apart from separately reporting for instructions, this order is hereby issued to your department for immediate notification, this order." (January 5th)</p>
<p>Preliminary Estimates of Major Crop Harvests in Jiangsu Province</p>
<h3 id="e91">Estimated by the Department of Agricultural Economics, College of Agriculture, Jinling University <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>In order to enable members of the public to understand the agricultural situation throughout the country, the Department of Agricultural Economics of the College of Agriculture of Jinling University began a pilot national agricultural survey and estimation in November 1932. This survey includes the harvest of major agricultural products in each province and the prosperity or decline of the rural economy in various places. To date, more than 1,000 reports have been received from various provinces. Based on the information from 129 reports from 41 counties in Jiangsu Province, the following preliminary estimates are made:</p>

The autumn-harvested crops were about 65% to 70% of the harvest in the average year, less than 60% of the harvest in 1931, but 80% of the harvest in 1932.</p>
<p>The Third Route Army Takes Over Defense of Yantai</p>
<h3 id="e92">Ge Guangting Reports to Han on the Takeover Process <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: JiaoJi Railway Commissioner Ge Guangting came west from Qingdao by JiaoJi Railway train and arrived in Jinan this morning (8th). According to Ge's account, there is no particular task for this trip. The Japanese warship stationed in Qingdao, since the YuGuan Incident, has been led by its commander, Tsuda, to Qinhuangdao. There are no Japanese warships in Qingdao now, and the local area is relatively calm. Since the YuGuan Incident, the arrogance of the Japanese has been rampant, but there is nothing that can be done about it. I will not stay in Jinan for long and may return to Qingdao tonight, etc. Also, according to Han Fuqu, Chief of General Staff Jiang (Bocheng) has already arrived in Nanjing, but there is no telegram today. All the local areas in Shandong are still calm. My trip to Beijing has been suspended due to the telegram from Chairman Jiang, and I will not be going elsewhere recently, etc.</p>
<p>According to another source, after Liu Zhennian's transfer, regarding the defense of coastal areas such as Yantai and Longkou, Provincial Government Chairman Han Fuqu believed that it would be most appropriate for the Navy to be stationed there, and repeatedly yielded to Shen Honglie. Shen also strongly declined, requesting Han's Third Route Army to take over. This issue has been unresolved for a long time. Recently, due to Zhang Xueliang's earnest request, Han sent a portion of his troops to take over the defense of Yantai and other places. Today (8th), after the Navy handed over defense duties, they have completely boarded their ships. Ge Guangting came to Jinan this time to conveniently report to Han on the Navy's handover of defense duties on behalf of Shen. (January 8th)</p>

<p>At 8:00 AM yesterday (10th), four robbers suddenly arrived at the Fulaide Electrical Materials Store on Damalu Road outside Changmen Gate, each carrying a handgun. At that time, the iron gate of the store was already open, but the wooden doors had not been fully opened. The four robbers forced a clerk who had gotten up to return upstairs and awakened the eleven employees who had not yet gotten up, driving them into the warehouse. One robber guarded them while the remaining robbers searched the store once. They then opened the iron box, robbing 141 silver dollars and 458 dimes. Finally, they returned to the upstairs and searched each employee's bedroom bedside before locking the warehouse, locking everyone inside, and leaving leisurely.</p>
<h3 id="e94">Suspicious Homicide Case Occurs Inside Changmen <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>A suspicious homicide case occurred inside the Chengtian Temple Grand Ironworks Alley in Changmen, Suzhou City. The detailed records are as follows: The case occurred at Wang Jinji Tailor Shop, No. 23 Grand Ironworks Alley. The shop owner, Wang Jingui, is from Zhutang, Jiangyin. He has four brothers. The youngest brother, named Zenggui, is 30 years old. He has been a partner at Xintai Qianzhuang on Hulong Street for 16 years. Four years ago, Zenggui brought his wife, née Fei (29 years old), a son, and a daughter to Suzhou to live with his brother Jingui. Zenggui would return to the Ironworks Alley at night to live with his wife, but sometimes he would stay at the Xintai shop. Zenggui’s room was upstairs facing the street, and there was a small toilet under the wall. Wang Jinji had a partner named Alin, 28 years old, from Changrehongta. He had been a partner in the shop for seven years. This past June, née Fei was cooling off at the back gate of Chengtian Temple when Alin began to flirt with her. On the night of July 18, when Zenggui was staying at the Xintai shop, Alin sneaked into née Fei’s room and had secret relations with her. However, Jingui heard the noise and investigated. The next day, they negotiated at the Yitu Teahouse. In the end, Zenggui wanted to divorce his wife and asked Alin to pay 300 yuan to take née Fei. Alin returned to his hometown to raise the money. When he came to Suzhou with the money, Zenggui suddenly regretted his decision. Jingui also fired Alin. After that, Alin lingered on the street corner, constantly enticing née Fei to elope with him from the front and back doors of Wang Jinji’s shop. Née Fei told Zenggui, who instructed her not to go out. From this month onwards, née Fei stayed upstairs with the door closed, not taking a single step outside. Suddenly, on the morning of the 9th at 9:00 AM, Zenggui went to Jiangyin to collect debts. At 2:00 AM that night, Alin braved the rain and climbed from the toilet outside the wall into née Fei’s room, took off his clothes, got into bed, and crawled under the covers. Née Fei woke up in shock. She was in a difficult situation and could hardly resist. At that time, Alin immediately told née Fei that even though they were far apart, he would always think of her. He was determined to elope with her today. If the doors were heavily guarded, they could go through the roof. Otherwise, he had a sharp blade today and was willing to die together with her. When née Fei heard about the knife, she shouted "No!" Wang Jingui and others heard the alarm and went upstairs, where they saw Alin lying naked in a pool of blood. A razor was inserted horizontally into his neck. He had already committed suicide. It was 3:00 AM. They immediately reported to the police. Alin was already dead. After the case occurred, viewers gathered and there was much discussion. Everyone doubted the suicide. At 5:00 PM on the afternoon of the 10th, after the court's examination, the wound was deeper on the left and shallower on the right, and his right hand was curved, so it was determined to be a suicide.</p>

<h3 id="e95">Petition to Maintain Agricultural and Sericultural Organizations <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>The Wuxi Sericulture Control Office and the Jiangdu Original Silkworm Seed Manufacturing Factory have achieved remarkable results since their establishment and are the foundation for fundamentally improving the silkworm industry by implementing silkworm seed restrictions. The Department of Industry, after discussion with the provincial government, decided to abolish them. All affiliated organizations were also to be closed by the end of the year and handed over to the Department of Construction for safekeeping. The leaders of the silk and silkworm industry in Jiangsu Province have submitted petitions to the central and provincial governments, requesting that the above two organizations be maintained and not closed down. Recently, the silk and silkworm industry in Jiangsu Province and Zheng Bijiang, Shao Shenpei, Lu Zirong, Fei Kuisheng, Xue Shouxuan, Qian Fenghao, Gu Shuzhi, Gao Jiansi, and others who are related to the agricultural, sericultural, and silk businesses in Wuxi City have held a meeting. They all agreed that Jiangsu Province is an agricultural area for silkworms and mulberries, and now is the time to improve sericulture and promote agricultural products. Organizations that have been established and have achieved results, such as the Jiangdu Original Silkworm Seed Manufacturing Factory, the Wuxi Sericulture Control Office, and the Wuxi Silk and Agricultural Farm, especially those with outstanding achievements, should not only be maintained as usual, but also be promoted as much as possible in order to improve the silk industry in Jiangsu Province and alleviate the economic situation of farmers. It was decided to jointly send a telegram to the province, requesting maintenance, and to appoint Gao Jiansi, Qian Fenghao, and Xue Shouxuan as representatives to go to Zhenjiang to petition the provincial government. The three representatives, Gao, Qian, and Xue, went to the province yesterday (the 10th) morning.</p>

<p>Li Afu, a resident of Shandun Lane, Zhuji Township, Second District of the county, is engaged in farming. At 6:30 PM the night before last, three robbers dressed in black and wearing felt hats, each armed with a pistol, broke into Li's house and ordered the owner to stop. They searched everywhere and robbed eleven pieces of cotton clothing and four pieces of gold jewelry. After the robbers got the loot, they went to rob the Zhang Shenglin family next door. However, it was still early, and the neighbors were already prepared, so as soon as they entered Zhang's house, the gongs outside began to sound. The robbers fired three shots and fled. Also, the house of Xue Jinhe, a villager in Wujing Bridge, Longshan Township, was broken into by three or four robbers around 2:00 AM the day before yesterday. The robbers broke down the door and tied up the owner, arbitrarily searching for loot. Jinhe's younger brother, Sanbao, escaped and sounded the alarm. The robbers set off two firecrackers and fled with the loot. By the time the police from the Ninth Sub-bureau of the Public Security Bureau arrived, the robbers were long gone.</p>

<p>The Sujia Road starts from Suzhou and ends in Jiaxing, Zhejiang. The section within Jiangsu Province has been under construction since the Jiangsu Construction Department established an engineering office in September last year. The progress of the project has been rapid. The section between Suzhou and Wujiang has been completely completed, and the road surface is new and very smooth. Vehicles can now pass through. The old Baodai Bridge in this section has long been famous in Suzhou. This time, during the construction of the road, a new bridge was built next to the old bridge, named New Baodai Bridge. The bridge is over 800 feet long and is the longest in Jiangsu Province. The bridge was completed at the end of the lunar year. The earthwork for the section from Wujiang to the Zhejiang border has also been completed. A total of 47 bridges have been built, about 30 of which have been completed. The road surface project in this section, with newly built earthwork that is not yet solid, is said to require further work after the roadbed is firm after rain and snow. The entire project is expected to be fully completed by the end of March this year. The Jiangsu Construction Department is currently planning to establish a long-distance bus service on the road and has been in contact with manufacturers in Shanghai to order vehicles. The planned equipment is quite complete. In the future, travel between Suzhou and Jiaxing should be comfortable and convenient. The Sujia Road is about 75 kilometers long, about 60 kilometers of which are in Jiangsu. The cost of the Jiangsu section is said to be about 550,000 yuan.</p>

<p>The provincial government, based on the report from the Third Regiment of the Security Team, determined that a soldier named Wu Zhiqing was actually named Wu Zhangfa. In 1920, in his hometown of Yiwu, he joined with convicted criminals Yu Xunmao, Shen Huangzhao, Chen Zhengcai, Ruan Qishu, and others to kidnap Shen Zhirun, Yu Xunping, Sheng Zhangsong, Wang Jingyu, Wu Chengyao, Pan Weixing, and others, demanding ransom money. In July of the same year, the bandit leader Hu Piqiu and others went to Hongtangban, Jinhua, to carry out a robbery. The bandit leader Hu Piqiu was killed on the spot by the people. His wife then led more than a hundred bandits to burn down all the houses in the village. The criminal Wu Zhangfa also participated in the scene. He had been wanted by the military and police for a long time without being caught. The criminal fled outside, changed his name to Wu Zhiqing, and enlisted in the 12th Company of the 4th Battalion of the Third Regiment of the Security Team. The Security Regiment of the Third District of Yiwu County learned about this, reported it to the county, which in turn reported it to the government, ordering the regiment to detain the criminal soldier and bring him to the province. The victims were summoned to the court for questioning, and the facts were clarified. He was sentenced to death. On the morning of the 10th of this month at 8:00 AM, the criminal Wu Zhiqing, alias Wu Zhangfa, was identified, bound, and taken outside Qingbo Gate to be executed by firing squad.</p>

<p>Feng Yuxiang sent a telegram to Li and others the day before yesterday, saying that compromise with Japan is the enemy.</p>
<p>The North China issue is becoming more and more serious. Our reporter interviewed Li Liejun, a member of the Central Committee staying in Shanghai, yesterday and asked for his opinion on the national affairs. According to Li, their political views have been expressed repeatedly, that is, advocating active armed resistance against foreign aggression and promoting the realization of democracy at home. After the Yu Incident, the ambitions of the Japanese warlords became more and more exposed to the world. For us, we can only implement the doctrine of armed resistance against Japan. To sit and wait for death is better than fighting to the death. Otherwise, if we let them slaughter us, the country will be destroyed in no time. The reporter then asked if Feng Yuxiang had sent any recent telegrams. Li replied that Mr. Feng is enthusiastically patriotic. Since hearing about the Yu Incident, he has been filled with righteous indignation and has repeatedly expressed his willingness to join the volunteer army to kill the enemy. Yesterday (the day before yesterday), he sent another telegram to Li and Mr. Xu Jilong, stating his advocacy of armed resistance against Japan, saying that those who carry out or support resistance against Japan are our friends, and those who compromise with Japan are our enemies. His agitation and indignation can be seen. Finally, Feng advocated forming an anti-Japanese fundraising association in Shanghai to prepare for logistics and other aspects.</p>

<h3 id="e103">Feng Zhanhai's Representative Pang Yuedong Discusses the Course of the Anti-Japanese War <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>Bitterly fought for years, retreated from Rehe</p>
<p>Now has an elite force of 40,000 men</p>
<p>General Feng Zhanhai, commander-in-chief of the 9th Army of the Northeast Volunteer Army, led his troops in fighting for more than a year between Changchun and Harbin in Jilin, repeatedly capturing famous cities and once recovering and besieging Harbin, a major city in the Northeast, threatening the Japanese invaders and their puppet regime. Due to lack of ammunition and supplies, he retreated to the border of Rehe. Recently, he sent his chief of staff, Pang Yuedong, as a representative to Shanghai to report on the war and request assistance. A reporter from the New Voice News Agency visited Pang at his residence yesterday and talked in detail about the anti-Japanese war of Feng's troops and their current situation.</p>
<p>Beginning of the Anti-Japanese War: Feng Zhanhai was originally the commander of the guard regiment of Zhang Zuoxiang's department in Jilin, with three battalions of infantry, one battalion of cavalry, one battalion of mountain artillery, and one company each of mortars and machine guns. Each infantry battalion had eight light machine guns, so the equipment was quite complete and relatively new. When the September 18th Incident occurred, when the Northeast armies were ordered to retreat, the chief of the Jilin government, Xi Qia, a traitor, took full power as chief of staff and ordered Feng to lead his troops lightly out of the province. The so-called lightly armed meant that they only carried guns and no bullets. Feng eventually took out all the mountain artillery shells, etc., and led a battalion of engineers to retreat to Panshi County, south of Jilin Province. At that time, although the true situation of the situation was not clear, he was already preparing to concentrate military power for resistance. Later, he fought around Acheng, Shuangcheng, Yushu, and other places along the Harbin-Changchun Railway. Soldiers and civilians from Jilin Province came to join him, and at most the number of his troops reached 140,000. Later, because of the complexity of the composition, and some who did not abide by military discipline, he was reorganized to 110,000.</p>
<p>Ammunition Replenishment: Feng's army fought around the Harbin-Changchun Line for more than a year. Because the soldiers had no radio station, they could not transmit the war situation at any time. Therefore, they did not receive any assistance from compatriots at home and abroad. The local people were also happy to transport the troops' supplies. The righteous soldiers gave their lives for the country and endured hardship as if it were sweetness. The most difficult thing was the replenishment of ammunition. However, the reason why they were able to persist for more than a year was that Feng had carried a lot of ammunition when he left the provincial capital. Later, the Japanese invaders instigated the puppet state to organize five bandit suppression brigades to fight against the righteous army. As a result, most of the soldiers of these five brigades brought their weapons and came back, and they got a lot of ammunition. Moreover, there were many civilian armed forces in the Northeast, and wealthy families often hid tens of thousands of bullets. Feng's army fought for several months and was trusted by the local people, so many enthusiastically transported them. As a result, they captured Wuchang, Yushu, Shuangcheng, Acheng, Fangzheng, Baoxian (formerly Weizigou), Yanshou (formerly Tongshi), Zhuhe, Shulan, Detonghui, and other counties, and once recovered Harbin and Jilin twice, besieging Harbin, making the Japanese invaders and their puppet regime uneasy. Rehe After fighting to the end, in July and August of last year, because the ammunition was gradually lacking, and the uniforms of the troops were very thin, and the north was cold early, and the winter was approaching, the righteous soldiers still had no cotton clothes, so they led 40,000 elites across the tributary of the Songhua River from Shulan, passing through Dehui, Nong'an (that is, the former Huanglong Prefecture in the west of the Harbin-Changchun Line), Changling, Kaitong (on the Siping-Taonan Road), Zhanyu, and reaching Kailu, Rehe. There are still more than 40,000 people left in the eastern part of Jilin Province, under the command of Wang Rongwu. By order of Feng Zhanhai, they are breaking up into pieces and carrying out harassment in the Jilin-Changchun Road area to destroy the facilities of the puppet regime.</p>
<p>Donations Received: Donations from all over the country to support the righteous army amounted to more than one million. Feng's troops in Jilin had no access. After reaching the border of Rehe, General Zhu Ziqiao gave them 80,000 yuan. As for cotton clothes and cold clothes, they have only recently been given access, and many have frozen to death. It was also heard from Liu Pixian, the representative of Li Du, that the two departments of Li Du and Ding Chao received a total of 70,000 yuan in donations from Shanghai. Combining the four departments of Ding Li Feng Wang (Delin), the total amount of donations received by the righteous army officially fighting in the Eastern Province is less than 300,000 yuan.</p>

<p>Liu Zhenbang, commander of the 11th Route of the Northeast People's Anti-Japanese National Salvation Army, telegraphed the Shanghai Northeast Righteous Army Support Association yesterday, reporting the combat situation of his troops and the situation in Yu and Rehe. The original telegram said: ㈠ My troops are in contact with the enemy in the Jinxi area, and there are victories and defeats. At the end of the year, the Japanese attacked Yu and Rehe. In order to eliminate the righteous army rate system, they used traitors as guides and airplanes as cover, and a large number of them oppressed us. After two days and nights of fierce fighting, the war was unprecedented. The righteous army suffered heavy casualties due to blunt weapons and lack of ammunition, and had no choice but to fight and retreat. Now they are holding on to the Dachanzi Dazigou area for reorganization and replenishment, waiting for an opportunity to counterattack. The morale is extremely high. ㈡ More than 4,000 old troops recruited by me in Qingyun Yanshan are gathering to set off and work together to save the country. ㈢ The righteous armies in Jin and Rehe suffered six or seven casualties in this battle. The enemy army is still advancing westward. Without rapid replenishment of ammunition, it is impossible to support them. ㈣ Yuguanjiang fell, and the two sides are confronting each other near Qinhuangdao. ㈤ The Mongolian bandits in Kailu on the border of Rehe were bribed by the puppet state and it is extremely urgent. ㈥ The maintenance of Tianjin is well done, and it is still peaceful. However, the people of North China saw the tragic situation of the Japanese attacking Yu and Rehe. I will report again later.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the General Taxation Department denied the rumor from Tianjin that the Qinhuangdao Customs had been closed, and said that the authorities had not issued such an order. Therefore, the Chinese and Western customs officers are still working as usual. The annual income of the customs is not small, and there is no reason to close or abolish it.</p>

<p>Central News Agency reported that Huang Naishu, director of the Shanghai Postal Administration, told the Central News Agency reporter that the mail in Yucheng is still being delivered as usual. At the beginning of the incident, because the news was blocked and the true situation was unknown, the mail was not stopped. Later, after receiving the bad news of the fall of the city and the interruption of railway traffic, the mail in that area was stopped. On the one hand, efforts were made to maintain postal operations. Fortunately, although the situation in Qinhuangdao was urgent, the railway traffic had not been interrupted. Therefore, all the mail in Yucheng was transported to Qinhuangdao by rail, and then transferred to the couriers on foot. The distance between the two places is about 20 miles, and it takes a long time to deliver on foot, but it is not too late. At the same time, the Yucheng Post Office reported that the local order was very chaotic, so the original number of branch offices were merged into one office, and all the employees were able to endure the difficulties and work with peace of mind. Therefore, unless something unexpected happens in Qinhuangdao, the postal operation will not be interrupted, and the Yucheng Post Office is unwilling to give up the postal rights unless it is absolutely necessary.</p>

<p>Various Trade Groups Fight for Telephone Price Increase</p>
<h3 id="e109">Yesterday's Letter to the Shanghai Municipal Council <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>Various trade associations in this city, regarding the matter of increased telephone rates in the concessions, have not yet reached a satisfactory resolution. Therefore, yesterday a special letter was sent to the Shanghai Municipal Council, requesting reconsideration, in order to resolve the situation as soon as possible. The original letter, jointly signed and sealed by over thirty trade associations, is as follows: "To the esteemed Shanghai Municipal Council, regarding the matter of increased telephone rates, our associations, based on the demands of users, unanimously and firmly oppose it. However, prolonged stalemate is not beneficial to the concessions. We hereby propose to your Council the following key points: (1) Although the news of the telephone rate increase was disclosed in Chinese newspapers in July, there was absolutely no prior announcement of the implementation measures. Moreover, the company requires users to retroactively compensate for the new rates, which has never happened before and is unreasonable and unlawful. Furthermore, non-retroactivity is a universally recognized legal principle. Now, Mr. Jones, the Secretary-General of your Council, tolerates the retroactive increase starting from March 27th, which seems to show bias towards the company. We believe that Mr. Jones, the Secretary-General of your Council, was originally a lawyer, how could he not know this? Knowing but not speaking, causing this mistake, we request your Council to quickly correct this error and rectify it. (2) The Shanghai Municipal Gazette of October 21st published Mr. Anson's letter to Mr. Jones, the Secretary-General of your Council, regarding opinions on the telephone rate increase. Upon investigation, the meaning of the third paragraph of that letter admits that this opinion did not consider the economic changes during this period. It also stated that if he were asked to come to China again for investigation, he would surely provide another report to satisfy our hopes. This proves that Mr. Anson's previous report admitted that it could not consider the interests of the majority of the public, leading to disputes. Therefore, the price increase has lost its basis. (3) The Shanghai Telephone Company incurred huge expenses due to the replacement of new equipment and expansion of lines. According to its own statement, from the company's establishment on August 5, 1930, to the end of September this year, a period of 26 months, the cost increased to a huge sum of 28 million taels due to the replacement of automatic equipment and expansion of new facilities, resulting in a total loss of 218,430 taels. Considering the loss over 26 months, the company has strived to expand its lines more than fourfold, and most of its staff are Westerners with high salaries. The loss due to extravagance and miscalculation is a natural consequence and cannot be used as a sufficient reason for a huge price increase and retroactive compensation for new prices. For the present plan, if you want to eliminate disputes and quell the storm, the only way is to have an impartial social organization recommend an accounting expert to audit the company's accounts to determine whether the price increase is unavoidable and whether the amount of the increase is appropriate, in order to seek a fair solution. We have always admired the gentlemen of your Council as enlightened individuals with fair judgment. This humble suggestion is respectfully submitted for inclusion on the agenda and a prompt vote to appease the expectations of the public. In addition to submitting the original letter with the joint signatures and seals of our associations to your Council, we are also sending a copy to your Council for reference and hope for your sympathy and permission to propose the motion for discussion. Respectfully addressed to the Gentlemen of the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Shanghai International Settlement."

<p>He Shangping's Report: He stated that there are over 20,000 overseas Chinese in Saigon, Annam. In the Ti'an metropolis alone, there are over 60,000 overseas Chinese, with over 2,000 stores. Every 25 stores on each street form a group, and 0.2 of the daily food expenses are collected as donations. Every week, the funds are transferred to the South China General Chamber of Commerce for deposit in the bank, and the amount of funds is announced once. Over 20,000 yuan can be obtained each month. Over the past few months, a considerable amount of money has been collected, and over 100,000 yuan has been successively remitted back to the motherland, with the hope that the soldiers of the motherland will bravely recover the lost territories. Because long-term resistance requires long-term support, they specially returned to the country to expand publicity, so that compatriots across the country can understand the patriotism of the overseas Chinese, etc. He also stated that raising funds in Annam is quite difficult, and they are often interfered with by the French authorities. Therefore, they use the name of relieving war disasters to avoid this. He hopes that reporters from various newspapers will do their best to publicize and jointly save the nation. Furthermore,</p>
<p>Zhang Chang Reported: He said that since the loss of the Eastern Provinces, volunteer armies have sprung up to resist, and the Shanghai Incident suddenly occurred, with the 19th Route Army also rising up to resist Japan. When the news spread to Vietnam, overseas Chinese rushed to remit funds for support. At that time, the association was initiated, and people were sent to contact and solicit donations from various overseas Chinese merchants. Those with a daily household expense of one yuan were asked to contribute 0.2 yuan. Overseas Chinese enthusiastically participated, and a large amount of funds was quickly collected and remitted to the motherland for support. However, the association's name was originally the "Association for Supporting the Anti-Japanese Army," but it was changed due to interference from the Vietnamese French authorities. The reason why the association sent brothers and others back to the country is because they realize that the national crisis is deepening. If the people of the country do not unanimously do their best to support the anti-Japanese army, there is no way to save the precarious national destiny. Therefore, they do not hesitate to return to the country from afar to publicize to the major ports, in order to awaken the compatriots of the motherland and promote a national movement of saving the country by tightening belts and reducing expenses. Now, they will ask you to come and hope to do your best to promote it to the people of the country. We will start tomorrow to go to Beijing to continue this ambition. We will delay in Beijing for about three days, and then go to Pingjin and other places by the Jinpu train. Other places will be determined temporarily. At 3:00 PM, photos were taken and the event dispersed.</p>

<p>The Seamen's Special Branch of the Kuomintang hosted journalists at the Shipping Club at No. 10 Guangdong Road yesterday at 6:00 PM. More than 10 reporters from various newspapers attended. During the event, Yu Jiayong, a standing committee member of the branch, stood up to speak and reported on the outline of the work plan. The guests and hosts dispersed happily at 7:30 PM. The following is a brief record of Mr. Yu's speech: "Our branch was established on the orders of the Central Government and has been in existence for more than a month. Due to the deployment of various internal affairs, it was delayed until today to meet with you. Upon investigation, seamen have indeed established many glorious achievements in the history of the national revolution. In terms of numbers, a total of more than 800,000 serve in domestic and overseas areas, as well as on inland river ships. At this time when the nation is oppressed and the national crisis is urgent, the issue of seamen is indeed an important and urgent issue at present, whether from the standpoint of the national survival movement, the labor life improvement movement, or the shipping development movement. Let us try to examine our country's coastal routes, from the mouth of the Yalu River in Liaoning in the north to the mouth of the Qiongzhou Sea in Guangdong in the south, with a total length of 7,500 kilometers. The inland rivers that can be navigated by ships total more than 40,000 kilometers. However, the management of shipping routes, ports, wharves, warehouses, etc., is almost entirely in the hands of imperialists. Let us examine the tonnage of our country's ships. Only more than 60 companies have ships with more than 1,000 tons, with only more than 200 ships, totaling less than 260,000 tons. Even if all the small ships in the country are combined, they total only more than 1.4 million tons. Compared with Japan's total tonnage, it is only one-tenth, and compared with the United Kingdom, it is only one-fiftieth. Faced with this difference in quantity, we feel alarmed and terrified by the transportation industry. We must examine various past facts and think about how to improve in the future. Therefore, issues such as the loss of shipping rights, the decline of the shipping industry, the improvement of labor life, and the pursuit of national survival cannot be delayed. Our branch is entrusted by the Central Government as the highest authority to lead seamen across the country. Seamen and party members will be transferred and registered separately, party districts will be divided, and party branches at all levels will be established to form a sound organization. As for how to recover shipping rights and how to develop the shipping industry, we must lead the seamen to follow</p>

<p>But Returned Twice Due to Fog</p>
<p>Rescheduled to Fly Again This Morning</p>
<p>The Shanghai-Ping air route of China National Aviation Corporation was originally scheduled to take off from Shanghai at 7:30 AM yesterday morning. However, due to heavy fog yesterday morning, it was delayed until 11:05 AM before taking off. However, it returned twice due to fog en route. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>=Returned Twice= After the heavy rain stopped yesterday morning, heavy fog filled the sky. The Shanghai-Ping route's "Bengbu" aircraft was delayed until 11:05 AM when the heavy fog subsided slightly before taking off, piloted by foreign pilot An Lishang. Nie Kaiyi, the director of the company, traveled with him, carrying 783 kilograms of airmail. It flew along the Yangtze River towards Nanjing. However, before flying for 15 minutes, dense fog reappeared, so it turned to land near the Zhenru Radio Station. At 11:45 AM, when the dense fog subsided slightly, it took off for the second time. However, it was still blocked by fog en route and returned to Longhua Airport at 12:05 PM.</p>
<p>=Continued Flight This Morning= After the aircraft returned to Longhua, Director Nie Kaiyi immediately telegraphed the Shanghai General Manager to report the experience of being blocked and returning, briefly stating, "We flew north at 11:10 AM, but were immediately blocked by fog and landed near the Zhenru Radio Station. At 11:45 AM, the weather cleared and the dense fog subsided slightly, so we took off for the second time. However, we were blocked by fog en route and returned to Longhua at 12:05 PM." Yesterday, Li Diezhuang, the secretary of the company, told a reporter from the Central News Agency that yesterday's (i.e., yesterday) test flight was turned back due to fog and rescheduled to fly again at 7:30 AM tomorrow morning (i.e., this morning).</p>
<p>=Shanghai-Hankou Also Blocked= The company's Shanghai-Hankou westbound aircraft was also delayed until 10:45 AM due to fog yesterday morning. It was also blocked by fog en route and returned at 12:10 PM. The aircraft flying from Hankou to Shanghai was also blocked by fog.</p>

<h3 id="e117">Recent Events of China Merchants Steam Navigation Company <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>Debt Consolidation Committee: Central News Agency reports that the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Debt Consolidation Committee held its third meeting at the company's board of directors yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM. Committee members Qian Yongming, Ye Zhuotang, Zhang Shouyong, Xu Yongzuo, Huang Bingzhang, Qin Liankui, etc., attended. Li Ming and Wang Youling were absent due to business. During the meeting, only the details of various debts were calculated as a whole, and the repayment procedures were scheduled to be transferred to tomorrow's board of directors for discussion.</p>
<p>Denial of Debt: A Japanese newspaper in this port reported that China Merchants Steam Navigation Company recently contacted Jardine Matheson for debt matters, and General Manager Liu Hongsheng has signed the documents. A reporter from Guowen News Agency went to the company yesterday to visit General Manager Liu and inquired about the truth of the matter. According to him, although China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has many problems, the exact amount of debt and assets has not been accurately counted. Since I took office, I have been working on compiling a balance sheet of assets and debts to clarify the true situation of the company. As for the various sections published in this newspaper the other day, they were due to misunderstanding.</p>
<p>Municipal Government Investigation: The Municipal Government found it quite strange to see the Japanese newspaper report that China Merchants Steam Navigation Company borrowed money from Jardine Matheson, so it specially sent Wang Shaozhai to China Merchants Steam Navigation Company yesterday to meet with General Manager Liu and inquire about the truth. Liu told him that the matter was due to a misunderstanding and there was no borrowing. Wang left after talking for about a quarter of an hour.</p>
<p>Commercial Firms Petition: Xinsheng News Agency reports that in addition to owing huge sums to HSBC and other banks over the years, China Merchants Steam Navigation Company also owes commercial firms, including Senhua Coal Company, Ruichangtai Hardware Company, etc., a total of 22 companies, totaling more than 400,000 yuan. Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, representatives of the creditors of Senhua Coal Company, etc., went to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's board of directors to petition. It happened to be the date of the regular meeting of the company's debt committee, and committee member Zhang Shouyong received them. The creditors waited quietly for a reply after the meeting.</p>
<p>10,000 Sets of Shares Collected: Guowen News Agency reports that according to an investigation, the board of directors has collected 11,000 sets of shares at the Central Bank as of yesterday. More than 7,000 sets of those shares have been exchanged for money, and the rest, 4,000 sets, are under the name of Sheng's Yuzhai Charity Villa. It is heard that another 5,000 to 6,000 sets are coming to Shanghai from Guangdong to be exchanged for money in the coming days. According to the current calculation of share collection, it has reached more than one-quarter of the total shares.</p>

<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's "Jiangda" steamship, which operates along the Yangtze River, set out from Hankou. About ten miles downstream of Hankou, on the Yutao River surface, it suddenly ran aground due to shallow water in winter. The "Jiangda" immediately sent a wireless message to notify the Hankou branch for rescue. At that time, the "Xingshi" and "Liji" happened to be in Hankou, so they sailed out to rescue. They pulled the "Jiangda" out of danger. Fortunately, it was in a shallow beach, and there was no major loss. According to Zhao Yuntai, the director of the shipping department of China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, he received a report that the "Jiangda" steamship had been safely rescued.</p>

<h3 id="e122">Original Text of the Judgment by the Jiangsu High Court in the Labor Dispute Case of the Sanyou Factory <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>Based on the revised Regulations for Handling Labor Disputes,</p>
<p>The employer cannot appeal against the arbitration decision.</p>
<p>The labor dispute at the Sanyou Industrial Society in Pudong, after being arbitrated by the municipal government, was appealed by the employer to the local court, which rejected the appeal. The employer still refused to accept the decision and appealed to the High Court, which, after hearing the case, also rejected the appeal. The original text of the judgment is excerpted below:</p>
<p>(Main Text) The appeal and incidental appeal, as well as the application for provisional execution, are all rejected. The costs of the second instance shall be borne by the appellant. (Facts omitted)</p>
<p>(Reasoning) The main purpose of the matters that the appellant declared should be adjudicated in this case is to seek confirmation that the employment contract has been terminated and, based on this reason, to request the annulment of the No. 20 arbitration decision made by the Shanghai Labor-Management Arbitration Committee on September 1 of this year (hereinafter referred to as the Committee Decision), and to order the appellee to return the occupied part of the factory and its equipment. Whether the employment contract has been terminated is indeed the central issue of the decision. According to the appellant, the Hongxianggang factory was suddenly attacked during the Shanghai Incident on January 28 of this year. The factory was occupied by enemy troops, the workers all left the factory long ago, and all work was completely stopped. The company paid off the remaining wages, implemented dissolution, and repeatedly posted notices in newspapers and reported to the relevant authorities for assistance. According to Article 30, Paragraph 2 of the Factory Law, the employment contract has indeed been terminated. This Court finds that both parties signed ten articles of treatment conditions on March 14, 1929, stipulating that if workers are dismissed or resign, they must be handled in accordance with Item 8 of the Provisional Measures for Retirement Treatment of Employees in Shanghai Special Municipality, as clearly stated in Article 5 of the conditions. The appellant did not follow the provisions of Article 5 of the negotiated measures, applying Item 8, and did not submit it to the Social Affairs Bureau for approval, but subjectively believed that the workers had been dismissed, which is not in accordance with the regulations. Regarding the appellant's claim that the treatment conditions signed by both parties at that time stated in the appendix that if the government amended the regulations in the future, the amended laws and regulations would still be followed and that the Factory Law should not be cited now, according to Article 30 of the Factory Law, if a factory suspends work for more than one month due to force majeure, it should still give prior notice in accordance with Article 27 of the same law. Although the reason for the suspension of work at the Hongxianggang factory this time was due to the suddenness of the war, a force majeure, it still cannot be considered that the obligation to give prior notice is waived according to law. Reviewing the appellant's notice on January 29, it only stated that the current situation was suddenly changing and extremely dangerous, and that all work in all departments was suspended. The announcements published in the newspapers on March 8 and May 24 also only stated that the factory was forced to suspend work due to its location, that the Japanese army was still stationed in the factory and had not yet withdrawn, and that the houses, machinery, and equipment were all beyond repair and could not be started. Do not mistakenly listen to rumors and make unnecessary trips. All of this indicated a suspension of work and did not declare closure and dismissal, so it cannot be regarded as a prior notice. According to current civil law, if the notice of termination is not received within the time limit, the right to terminate is extinguished (see Article 257 of the Civil Code). The appellant's strenuous arguments inevitably lead to stubborn prejudices. Since the employment contract has not been terminated, as stated above, except for the recent workers who voluntarily received wages from the appellant's company, wrote letters of intent, and sought other livelihoods, the rest are still in the company waiting for work after the incident is resolved. Living in the original factory houses cannot be called occupation, so there is no requirement for prosecution and return. The Shanghai Municipal Government, seeing that both parties had exhausted their means and could not resolve the situation themselves, accepted the parties' petitions and handled the matter. If the handling failed, the Labor-Management Arbitration Committee was organized to make a decision according to law. This was originally to protect the interests of both labor and management and to achieve peace and tranquility, and it was a power granted by current laws and regulations. Although the appellant vehemently stated the pros and cons of the Committee Decision, believing that it could not be followed, the main points were nothing more than that partial resumption of work was impossible, that dismissed workers should be employed by the Hangzhou factory first, that there were practical obstacles, and that there were concerns that disputes would arise over retirement pay. However, the loss of the Hongxiang factory due to the incident is a fact, but the Sanyou Industrial Society has not closed down due to the Shanghai Incident. The company still has more than two million yuan in capital, and the committee designated Accountant Pan to check the accounts. The results showed that the actual losses in recent years have not reached 200,000 yuan, and the capital stock has been depleted by only less than 10%. In terms of financial resources, restoring the Hongxianggang factory is not absolutely impossible. Reducing the scale, adapting to the circumstances, reconfiguring, and resuming part of the work, what is impossible? Although the harvest may be small, wages and various expenses can be reduced together. Weighing the pros and cons, it is not impossible to maintain. As for the workers who should resume work, the criteria for selecting people should be determined by the labor union itself. The decision did not order the appellant to choose, so there is no need to worry too much. If the Hangzhou Municipal Government prohibits the dismissal of workers, making it difficult to implement at that time, the appellant may request the relevant administrative authorities to seek other remedies. Moreover, since the appellant promised the Shanghai Municipal Government that it would find another way to proceed in the nearby Hangzhou factory and seek to expand it at any time in order to reduce the number of unemployed workers, it has now suddenly gone back on its word, claiming that it is impossible in fact, which is obviously an excuse for shirking responsibility. Whether retirement pay should be enjoyed after dismissal is also clearly stipulated by laws and regulations, which can be handled easily and should not be asserted as a matter of litigation. The original trial court found that the appellant's request was not justified and rejected the appellant's lawsuit, which was not inappropriate. Furthermore, the Regulations for Handling Labor Disputes have been revised and promulgated on September 27 of this year. Article 7, Paragraph 1 of the law states that the disputing party may not appeal against the decision of the arbitration committee. Article 44, Paragraph 2 stipulates that disputes that occurred before the promulgation and implementation of the revised law and have not yet been resolved may be handled in accordance with this law. Although this case has been decided by the arbitration committee, the lawsuit has not yet ended, that is, the dispute has not yet been resolved. The appellant has no reason to object to the arbitration decision. Furthermore, although the employment contracts of the appellees have not been legally terminated, the appellant's factory was indeed suspended due to an event of force majeure, and it did not fail to pay wages on time without reason, so it is not liable for compensation. Since there is no obligation to compensate, there is no need to declare provisional execution. It goes without saying that the original trial court also rejected the appellee's counterclaim and application for provisional execution, which was also not inappropriate. Based on the above conclusions, the appeal and incidental appeal in this case are both without merit. In accordance with Article 415 and Article 81 of the Civil Procedure Law, the judgment is as stated in the main text. Jiangsu High Court, Second Civil Division. Presiding Judge Wu Yuxin. 印.

<p>The Electricity Company Again Attempts to Threaten Users by Cutting Off Power</p>
<h3 id="e125">Taxpayers Association Sends Letter to the Municipal Council Requesting Correction <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese Taxpayers' Association of the Public Concession sent a letter to the Chief Secretary of the Municipal Council yesterday, stating: "To the esteemed Chief Secretary, according to a letter from Zheng Xinji of Jin Business Bureau, our bureau is located at No. 765 East Agulu Road. The electricity is under the name of Zheng Xinji, which has been used for about ten years. Regarding electricity bills, we have always paid them in full according to the bills from the Municipal Council's Electrical Department and now the Shanghai Electric Power Company. The recording, inspection, installation, and removal of electricity meters have never been notified or consulted with us, nor is there any way to consult. Unexpectedly, on January 6th of this year at 12:00 AM, we received a letter from the Shanghai Electric Power Company dated January 5th, stating that the motor meter was inspected as usual on December 1st of last year, and it was found that the hard seal was forged. The electric light meter was inspected on December 14th, and the old meter was removed on the 15th. After testing in the laboratory, it was found that the magnet inside was displaced and the speed was reduced by 29.5%. We must pay a supplementary electricity fee of 122 taels, 8 qian, and 8 fen from January 15, 1929, to December 15, 1932, within 48 hours, otherwise, the power supply will be cut off. The bill has been sent. To determine a crime, first, there must be strong evidence, and this evidence must be acknowledged by the person involved and certified by a notary. Second, there must be a final judgment by the court. Now, the Shanghai Electric Power Company's evidence collection procedure is already non-compliant, and without a court trial and determination, it is both slander and a violation of the law. As for the supplementary fee from January 15, 1929, the company has self-determined the so-called forged hard seal from that date. What are the duties of the company's inspectors? Their arbitrariness is obvious. Furthermore, the old meter was removed on December 15th of last year, and the situation was tested in the laboratory. Is this any different from a private individual determining in their home that the company's meter readers, inspectors, removers, and installers are all opportunists, demanding the company to compensate for losses? Our bureau, for the sake of justice and legal interests, is willing to let the company cut off power, causing our bureau to suffer illegal infringement and suspension of business, rather than pay this kind of money for which there is absolutely no legal obligation to pay, under the circumstances of the so-called findings in the company's laboratory before the company gets on the right legal track. However, if we allow the company's unfair enrichment method to succeed, there will be the following consequences: 'Under the company's self-assertion, (1) electricity users must pay fees without using electricity, (2) the electricity company can collect fees without supplying electricity, and the status of electricity users is in danger.' Your association is an organization to protect citizens. Even if it is not for the current situation of our bureau, it should consider the future of the citizens and seriously negotiate with the Municipal Council to stop the company's illegal schemes to seek unfair enrichment. The citizens will be fortunate, and our bureau will be fortunate." Upon receiving the letter, it was found that the actions of the Shanghai Electric Power Company are inconsistent with legal regulations. Previously, this was applied to Laoyan Maoyuan in Central City on Fuzhou Road, and we have repeatedly sent letters to your bureau requesting correction. Now, based on the previous situation, we hereby send a letter to your bureau requesting a swift correction to prevent the company from going its own way, causing all electricity users to be disheartened. Sincerely, Shanghai Public Concession Municipal Council Chief Secretary.</p>
<h3 id="e126">Bloodshed at the Sincere Amusement Park <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>A Tourist's Sleeves Are Stained with Blood</p>
<p>Suspected and Arrested</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 4:45 PM, a bloody assassination occurred inside the Dajing Class Theater at the Sincere Amusement Park on Nanjing Road. The victim was a middle-aged man, about thirty years old, whose name could not be found. The man was wearing a black faux-fur camel绒长袍, lined with a blue-threaded spring padded jacket and trousers. There were only two small yuan in his pocket. He was struck once in the face with an axe, twice in the back of the head, and had five or six wounds on both hands. Blood was all over the ground, and he had already died. The body was lying at the entrance between the sets of the Dajing Class Theater. The time of the murder and the identity of the murderer were unknown. Later, the park's staff discovered it and immediately reported it to the Laozha Police Station, which dispatched a large number of detectives to the scene to search for the murderer. As a result, they discovered a tourist-like person with bloodstains on his sleeves. When questioned, he was evasive and quite suspicious, so they took him to the police station for questioning. However, the man firmly denied committing the murder. As for his name, the police station is temporarily not announcing it because they still need to pursue accomplices. However, it is known that this person is from Shandong and is about forty years old. He is currently being held in the police station, while an investigation is underway to find the victim's family. The body was sent to Renji Hospital by Chinese patrol car No. 1565 and then transferred to the Philen Road Forensic Examination Office, pending a report to the court for examination this morning.</p>
<h3 id="e127">Over Four Hundred Inmates at the Local Court Detention Center Create a Major Commotion <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>| New Superintendent's Reforms Not Implemented |</p>
<p>| Detainees Feel Mistreated, Nearly Leading to a Major Incident |</p>
<p>All the detainees held in the Shanghai Local Court Detention Center are defendants whose cases have not yet been decided. In the past, all superintendents have followed the regulations of the Criminal Procedure Law, which allow defendants to provide their own food and daily necessities. Every morning, defendants could prepare their own breakfast snacks and receive money from family members for their use. Defendants whose cases have not been decided are treated differently from prisoners in jail. Former Superintendent Shao Zhenji's reform of exchanging cash gifts from family members for money vouchers caused inconvenience for defendants in their use and redemption, leading to complaints. After former Superintendent Shao was dismissed, newly appointed Superintendent Wang Tingqi took office. Superintendent Wang believed that there was a risk of corruption among the lower-level staff and clerks in the detention center, so he replaced all the old staff and changed all the facilities. For all visits with detainees, money given by family members was stored by the superintendent. If a defendant needed to provide their own food, they had to apply to the superintendent for approval one day in advance, who would then discretionarily allocate money for their use. Purchasing breakfast from outside was prohibited due to concerns about potential abuses. As a result, the more than four hundred detainees felt mistreated and collectively went on a hunger strike and created a commotion at 11:00 AM yesterday during mealtime. A major disaster was nearly averted in the detention center. Upon hearing the noise, Superintendent Wang immediately supervised the guards with guns to maintain order and reported to the court president and the chief prosecutor, who sent personnel to the detention center to investigate. He tried his best to persuade the defendants to accept improvements to their treatment within the bounds of the law. The inmates finally lowered their heads in obedience, became quiet, and returned to their original state. All the new policies of reform and innovation were then suspended. However, he had already had a good scare. The detention center's main gate was closed for an hour.</p>
<h3 id="e128">Brawl at Huaiyang Teahouse on Hengfeng Road <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>Bodyguards Participate Due to Misunderstanding</p>
<p>Guns and Bullets Fly, Police Arrive and Make Arrests</p>
<p>At 10:00 PM the night before last, dozens of hooligans suddenly appeared in front of the Huaiyang Teahouse at the intersection of Hengfeng Road in Zhabei, each inviting members of the bodyguard corps, and they mutually engaged in a group brawl. Both sides fired more than a dozen shots, fortunately without injuring anyone. The local Fourth District Second Precinct was notified, and Officers Yuan and Lin led the entire police force to suppress the situation, arresting more than ten defendants and plaintiffs on the spot and confiscating two six-inch handguns containing twenty-two bullets, as well as a car, all of which were taken to the station. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Originating from a Female Worker's Suspension: Wang Agen, a 30-year-old man from Yancheng residing at No. 67 Hanzhong Road, is a foreman. His wife, Chen, used to work in a silk factory but was recently suspended by Chen Shiying, who was in charge of the machines, causing Wang to harbor resentment and constantly think about revenge. The night before last, he gathered members of the First Team of the Bodyguard Corps, Zhao Lianfa, Li Jinzhong, Li Fucheng, Dan Wufeng, and more than twenty hooligans, waiting at the Huaiyang Teahouse. Then, he borrowed a car with a concession pass number 6573 from his friend Gu Shenglin at No. 6 Baokang Lane, whose owner was a friend, and drove to Chen Shiying's house at No. 55 Changle Lane, intending to force Chen onto the car and bring him to the Huaiyang Teahouse to "drink tea" (mediate).</p>
<p>Chen to Arrive in Five Minutes: At the time, Chen Shiying was about to go out to visit friends when he caught sight of Wang loitering on the way, looking very nervous, fearing it would be detrimental to him. Therefore, he secretly invited his friends Xiao Wenbin and Jin Xianglin, who were members of the Eighth Team of the Bodyguard Corps, and more than ten workers to come out with him. Wang saw Chen and his group of people and found it inconvenient to act, so he stepped forward and said to Chen, "Please come to the Huaiyang Teahouse for a chat." Chen replied that he would arrive in five minutes. Wang then got into the car and waited at the teahouse.</p>
<p>A Chaotic Fight and Scuffle: After a while, Chen indeed went to the teahouse with more than ten people. Wang immediately instigated his assistants to grab Chen and beat him severely. At this time, Chen's friends stepped forward to fight back, and a chaotic fight ensued. Tables and chairs were overturned, and cups and pots flew everywhere. Soon, both sides opened fire, the gunshots sounding like a continuous string of pearls. The owner of the teahouse, fearing a major disaster, immediately called the Fourth District Second Precinct.</p>
<p>Chief Gong's Interrogation and Confessions: Upon receiving the report, Chief Gong Houzhai immediately ordered Officers Yuan and Lin, along with police chief Wang Shande and the entire police force, to rush to the scene. When the assistants from both sides saw the police arrive, they scattered like birds and beasts. The police arrested the group of people and the two live-ammunition handguns discarded on the ground and took them to the station. Yesterday, Chief Gong conducted a preliminary hearing. According to the plaintiff Chen Shiying, a 22-year-old man from Ningbo, Wang wanted to extort 50 yuan from him but failed, so he gathered bodyguard corps members to shoot at him. According to Wang, he went to Chen's house in his friend Wang Alin's car, and Chen shouted "kidnapping." He was informed by the bodyguard corps and taken to the Huaiyang Teahouse to "drink tea," so he instigated the corps members to open fire. Jiang Fuchun from Liuhe, 21 years old, Zhao Lianfa from Shanghai, 18 years old, Li Jinzhong from Yangzhou, 36 years old, Li Fucheng from Baoshan, 21 years old, and Dan Fengwu from Jiading, 30 years old, all said that they were members of the First Team and were ordered by Platoon Leader Luo to investigate the situation at the Huaiyang Teahouse and did not beat anyone. Xiao Wenbin from Yancheng, 21 years old, and Jin Xianglin from Shanghai, 23 years old, who were members of the Eighth Team of the Bodyguard Corps, also denied firing shots and fighting. Chief Gong reviewed the confessions and, considering the case involved a crowd gathering to open fire and fight, although no one was injured, it violated criminal law and ordered that they all be transferred to the bureau for further investigation. The confiscated car was claimed by its owner yesterday.</p>
<h3 id="e129">Old Clerk Reports Bizarre Robbery <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>Why Would Robbers Take a Big Roundabout Route?</p>
<p>Inconsistent and Incomplete Details Arousing Suspicion</p>
<p>Xie Sheng Fruit Shop, located opposite the Xiaodongmen Police Station in the French Concession, has been in business for many years and has always been very prosperous. The shop has an old clerk named Zhang Misheng, 39 years old, from Chuansha, who has been working there for more than twenty years. He is usually considered diligent and careful in his work. Yesterday morning around 9:00 AM, Zhang was ordered by the accountant to take 2,700 yuan in banknotes, 300 yuan in silver dollars, and three promissory notes totaling 460 yuan, placing them in a money-carrying bamboo basket, and send them to Deqin Xin Money Exchange in Langjiaqiao outside the Dadongmen in Nanshi for deposit. Unexpectedly, around 11:00 AM, Zhang suddenly went to the First District of the Municipal Public Security Bureau to report that he had encountered robbers on the road and all the banknotes had been stolen. When Officer Ren of the district conducted a preliminary hearing, Zhang Misheng stated, "Just now, I walked out of the shop and passed the back gate of the Jie Pufeng Guild Hall on Li Ma Road. Suddenly, four robbers wearing blue cloth long gowns and speaking with a northern accent ordered me to stop and immediately pulled out guns, forbidding me from making any noise. They hired three rickshaws, forced me to ride in one, and the other two were ridden by two robbers each. One robber walked in front, and one walked behind the rickshaw. My rickshaw was in the middle of the two rickshaws ridden by the robbers. I was escorted south to Yanmatou, passing through Yangjiadu Hengjie and Laobaidu Hengjie, then west through Longwangmiao, south along Doushi Street, turning to Zixia Road, then south through Wangjia Zuijiao, reaching Wangjia Wharf, west into Xiaojiuhua Street, then south along Zhonghua Road, until we reached the entrance of the Shanghai Social Bureau, where we finally stopped. The two robbers immediately came up and snatched the 2,700 yuan in banknotes, 300 yuan in silver dollars, and three promissory notes totaling 460 yuan from the basket I was carrying, taking the stolen goods and fleeing. The remaining two robbers then took me to Qiaojia Bang, turned into Yongxing Street, and arrived at Yujia Alley, where the two robbers finally fled in different directions. However, the 118 yuan in banknotes that I had on my person was not stolen. I immediately returned to the shop to report and then came here to report for investigation." The district officer found that the details stated by Zhang were not entirely true and that such a robbery was unheard of. How could there be such foolish robbers? When they encounter the victim, they should rob immediately to avoid failure. Why would they ride rickshaws in a big roundabout route until they reached the entrance of the Social Bureau on Zhonghua Road before taking action? Could that place be more conducive to robbing? Moreover, there were police officers from the Third Precinct of the First District stationed at the entrance of the Social Bureau, and across the street was the headquarters of the Shanghai South Bodyguard Corps, and nearby was the Xiaonanmen Outpost of the Third Precinct of the First District. How could the robbers be so bold as to rob on that road? Furthermore, Zhang did not report to the police on duty afterward, only coming to the district to report more than an hour later. All of this suggests that there is something hidden. He ordered a formal document to be prepared and Zhang Misheng to be sent to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for strict investigation to uncover the truth.</p>
<h3 id="e130">Local Area Heavy Fog Halts Over Forty Ocean-Going Vessels <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>In recent days, as the weather has warmed, heavy fog has occurred in this port and off the coast of Wusong. Shanghai's import and export merchant ships were halted by the fog yesterday, unable to enter the port, resulting in delays to scheduled services for dozens of vessels. Detailed information is as follows:</p>
<p>Ocean-Going Vessels Halted: North and South Seas coastal ships arriving in Shanghai yesterday from Shantou, Hong Kong, Guangzhou, Yantai, Tianjin, Qingdao, Dalian, etc., including the Taikoo Jardine's "Guangdong," "Ding Sheng," Nisshin's "Rojozan Maru," D汽's "Dalian Maru," etc., were all scheduled to enter the port yesterday. However, these ocean-going vessels encountered heavy fog the night before in the waters off Wusong. Due to the navigation routes on the sea being obscured by the fog, the ships were unable to proceed and dared not take the risk of causing accidents. They collectively anchored at sea to take shelter. However, the heavy fog did not dissipate throughout yesterday, preventing the ocean-going vessels from entering the port until late at night.</p>
<p>Mail Ships Delayed: The Pacific Line mail ship "President Coolidge" of the Dollar Line, arriving in Shanghai from Seattle, the Nippon Yusen Kaisha's European route mail ship "Suwa Maru," arriving in Shanghai from London, and the British company's "Nilanshi," also arriving in Shanghai from Europe, all scheduled to arrive in Shanghai yesterday, were also hindered by the heavy fog and were delayed. They may be able to enter the port today if the fog dissipates. Outbound mail ships, such as the "Taileer" of 美最時 and the "Dunkirk" of 大英, bound for Hamburg and London, arrived at the Wusongkou yesterday and are also waiting for the fog to clear before proceeding. Riverboats Not Arrived: In previous heavy fogs, Yangtze River boats have always entered the port without delay. However, this time the fog was particularly heavy, and all Yangtze River boats of 六公司 were blocked at the mouth of the Yangtze River, unable to sail to Shanghai, as there was also heavy fog in various parts of the Yangtze River. Not a single Yangtze River boat arrived yesterday, and only three merchant ships and one warship entered the port all day, causing all regular Yangtze River boats scheduled to depart this morning to be delayed.</p>
<p>All Ships Postponed: Yesterday, more than forty Jianghai vessels were blocked by fog outside the mouth of Wusong and unable to enter the port, which has affected the North and South Seas and Yangtze River schedules departing today. As usual, the ships "Tonghe," "Anqing," "Yisheng," "Jinan," "Nagasaki Maru," "Ikoma Maru," "Nilanya," "Mankok" and others scheduled to depart today have all postponed their departure dates due to the fog. This heavy fog has caused a "sea famine" in Shanghai, which is a rare occurrence. However, the Shanghai-Ningbo route liners "Xin Jiang Tian" and "Yong Xing" departed as usual.</p>
<p>Greyhound Racing Association Sues the Municipal Council's Director-General</p>
<h3 id="e131">Rescheduled Re-trial for February 7th <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>The "Continental Daily" reports that the Greyhound Racing Association's lawsuit against the Municipal Council for closing the Ming Garden dog racing track, suing former Director-General Major General Macnaghten and Chief Constable Martin, and seeking compensation of 2.25 million taels, has been scheduled for a re-trial on February 7th by the British Supreme Court for China. The case has been ongoing for over a year. After the case was ordered to be dismissed by Sir Grain, the British Chief Justice for China, the Greyhound Racing Association appealed, and the Court of Appeal ordered a re-trial. Therefore, Sir Grain has scheduled the re-trial to begin on February 7th.</p>
<h3 id="e132">Fang Jiaobo Discusses Various Types of Insurance <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>Fang Jiaobo, manager of the Shanghai General Insurance Office for Various Industries, spoke yesterday about various types of insurance, saying that insurance matters have always been controlled by foreign merchants, with Chinese merchants accounting for only one-tenth, and the outflow of profits being extremely small. The reason for this is that the majority of policyholders tend to favor foreign merchants, which is truly distressing. Recently, Chinese merchants' insurance is not without capacity. Colleagues in various industries believe that the fundamental interest of policyholders lies in the industries themselves, so they can shift their mentality and promote Chinese merchants' insurance, which will have a significant effect. At the same time, considering that policyholders have been oppressed for a long time, and their wishes are often violated when they suffer disasters, efforts should be made to alleviate their suffering. This led to the organization of the General Insurance Office for Various Industries, combining the strength of various industries, on the one hand, to promote the development of Chinese merchants' insurance industry, and on the other hand, to handle procedures on behalf of policyholders and safeguard their due rights. Since the beginning of the founding, colleagues have elected me as the general manager. I believe that this initiative is a social undertaking, not entirely a business nature, so I dare to take the task. I am willing to devote my meager efforts to serving the society as always and seek benefits for the public. Personally, I have only sacrifice and no rights. However, I know that my ability is weak, and I rely entirely on the support of all sectors of society to be successful.</p>
<h3 id="e133">International Charity Race Postponed to the 26th of This Month <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>The International Charity Race, originally scheduled for the 14th of this month, was suddenly postponed yesterday. A reporter from the Central News Agency inquired about the situation with the Finance Bureau. The person in charge of the bureau gave a detailed explanation, which is disclosed as follows: (1) From the date of initiation to the originally scheduled competition date, the time for handling the fundraising for the race was less than a month. Although it has received enthusiastic support from all sectors of society, the sales of lottery tickets have reached more than 85% (excluding the sales of the Jockey Club and foreign merchants, etc.), but there are many sales points in the various parks of the Municipal Council.</p>
<h3 id="e134">| Flowers Blooming Luxuriously in the Greenhouse of Zhaofeng Park | <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>In December of last year, Zhaofeng Park had a total of 30,275 visitors, Hongkou Park had 15,431 visitors, Waitan Park had 11,066 visitors, and Huishan, Sterly, Singapore, three parks, Nanyang Road, Yuyuan Road, Suzhou Road, and Kunshan Fangchang's various children's amusement parks had a total of 40,874 visitors. The flowers are blooming luxuriantly in the greenhouse of Zhaofeng Park. More than 40,000 spherical flower seeds have been planted in each park. The stronger annual flowers are being planted. Due to the sudden change in weather, it was postponed to February. All trees are being pruned in winter. Grass clumps have been erected in the flower beds to protect the more delicate seedlings from the cold. The Children's Playground on Difeng Road was closed on December 20th. The swings and other items, as well as most of the trees, have been moved to the Children's Amusement Park on Nanyang Road.</p>
<p>There are more than forty places, and the procedures for collecting ticket money, sorting out ticket stubs, and returning the remaining lottery tickets from a few sales points are extremely complicated. Even if the bureau sets a deadline, it is impossible to complete the matter in a few days. Moreover, this matter is co-organized by various Jockey Clubs, and many foreigners also support it. The bureau is responsible for promoting sales, and its responsibility is very heavy, and its reputation is at stake. It must handle the matters smoothly before holding the event. (2) The event is postponed to January 26th of this year, which is only twelve days from the original date, which is not too long. That day happens to be the Lunar New Year's Day. Shanghai society usually rests invisibly. The fundraising method for this race has been determined for the prize ticket commission, but the income from each race and ticket sales on that day, after expenses, is also fully allocated to relief efforts in disaster areas. Therefore, using that day can increase the audience, and the funds for disaster relief may be able to collect tens of thousands of dollars more. Based on these two reasons, the bureau and the Jockey Club both agreed to postpone the event. As for the ticket money, as of the 9th of this month, the bureau has transferred 755,000 yuan to the Shanghai Race Club, and the number deposited by the Race Club in HSBC is said to reach 830,000 yuan, which has exceeded the total amount of awards, etc. It is found that the last time this port held a horse race to raise money for the flood, the ticket money was not fully concluded until the day of the competition, resulting in a compromise method of competing before the conclusion. This time, the competition will be held at the Shanghai Race Club, which concerns the credibility of both Chinese and foreigners, so the Finance Bureau advocates concluding the matter properly in advance.</p>
<p>New Ferry Launched in the City</p>
<h3 id="e135">Extremely Convenient with Double-Ended Operation <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>The city-run ferry strives to be perfect in equipment such as ships and wharves, and the journey is safe, fast, and convenient for travelers. Since the opening of the Jiang Ferry, it has been open regardless of wind or rain, and the fees are particularly low. Although the business has losses, it is willing to take care of the livelihood of the common people. Recently, it was heard that two diesel-powered Jiang ferries operating on both ends are planned ( ), and the latest fish-backed steel rudder is used, which can rotate freely and is very effective. It can also carry two cars, and even freight cars can be carried because the roof of the ship is active and can be removed at any time. The ferry was launched at the He Xing Factory in Nanshi on the morning of the 8th of this month, and it will be completed soon. The purpose of operating on both ends is to avoid the cumbersome process of turning around and the danger of collision, which is unprecedented in the country. The fish-backed rudder blades are an original idea in Beijing. In the future, the official opening will benefit travelers.</p>
<p>Talk about Increasing the Price of City Ferries: Second Class Will Not Be Increased for the Time Being</p>
<p>Recently, the city's city ferry has increased the price of the special and first-class fares for the long ferry (Shanghai to Gaoqiao) due to increased costs and business losses. A reporter from the Central News Agency inquired with the ferry and was told that the ferry was originally set up to popularize civilian transportation, so the second-class cabin is the main body, and its special first-class passengers are mostly those who visit the suburbs in spring, summer, and autumn, while the second class is more prosperous in winter. Therefore, the special first class is mostly tourists, and the second class is ordinary passengers. This time the price increase will not be applied to the second class, no matter how expensive the materials are or how much the cost increases. However, in order to take care of the cost, we have to find other ways to remedy it, so we will increase the special first-class fare as appropriate to supplement it. The second class will still be charged at the old price more than ten years ago. Moreover, the city-run Jiang Ferry lines cost tens of thousands of yuan, and the fares charged are almost the same as those of private ferries with boats worth hundreds of yuan, resulting in huge losses. These passengers are all ordinary passengers, and the fares cannot be increased again, so the business losses cannot but be compensated by the long ferry tourists. In other words, I hope to make tourists with more financial resources increase their burden to make up for the business losses suffered by the second-class seats and the Jiang Ferry. The meaning is the same as that of various countries in Europe and the United States and this country imposing heavy taxes on luxury goods. Recently, the rear cabin of the first class has been removed to expand the second-class seats to avoid crowding.</p>

<p>The Shanghai City Guoshu Museum previously planned to open a Guoshu training class to promote Guoshu, and the city's Municipal Public Education Museum also planned to set up a Guoshu practice class. Wu Tiecheng, the curator of the Shanghai City Guoshu Museum, discussed the joint organization method with Pan Gongzhan, the director of the City Education Bureau. Recently, it has been decided that the class will be opened in the Municipal Public Education Museum in the Wenmiao Park. All Guoshu instructors will be appointed by the Guoshu Museum. For the sake of convenience, the Public Education Museum will be responsible for assigning staff to handle the affairs. It is reported that the class has started recruiting students. The original quota was 60, but there are already more than 70 applicants. The Guoshu Museum has appointed Ma Wanlong as the instructor, and will first open a Shaolin Boxing training class starting today according to the original plan. If the number of people increases, a Taijiquan training class will be opened separately. The training time is set from 7:00 am to 8:30 am.</p>

<p>A Money Shop Mistakenly Paid a Huge Amount</p>
<p>Duan Zhiyun Repeatedly Lied</p>
<h3 id="e138">| Stolen Evidence Seized, Fine of 400 Yuan | <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>Duan Zhiyun, a local construction engineer of the Yizhong Real Estate Company at No. 6 Jiujiang Road, took a bank draft for one hundred taels of silver to the Hengxiang Money Shop at No. 18 Ningbo Road in the morning before yesterday to exchange it for cash. At that time, a Mr. Wang also went to the shop to exchange money. Wang had business dealings with the shop, so he handed a bank draft for 3,000 yuan to the accountant and went to another room to visit a friend. Later, Shao Yaochen, the accountant of the shop, handed 3,000 yuan in banknotes to Shao Zhenxiang, a shop clerk, for transfer. Because Mr. Wang was not seen, and only Duan Zhiyun was waiting outside the counter to receive the money, Zhenxiang mistakenly identified Duan as the person who wanted to receive the 3,000 yuan and paid it to him. Although Duan knew it was a mistake, he was temporarily blinded by greed and took the money and left. After Duan left, Shao Yaochen suddenly became suspicious and realized the mistake after checking. He rushed out to chase him, but he had lost track of the person who took the money. He took Duan's bank draft for one hundred taels of silver to the General Patrol Room to report and requested an investigation. The head detective found that the one hundred tael ticket was issued by the Huacheng Canvas Factory, and Duan Zhiyun's seal was stamped on the back of the ticket. He sent detective Ma Mouxiang and a Western detective to Huacheng to investigate and found out where Duan worked. He went to Yizhong Company to inquire and was told that Duan had returned to his residence at No. 1 Minxin Lane, Mintini Yin Road, French Concession. The Chinese and Western detectives rushed to Duan's house, but Duan not only denied taking the 3,000 yuan, but also denied his original name, saying that his name was Wang Zhenxiang. However, Shao Zhenxiang, a shop clerk of Hengxiang who went with the detectives, still recognized this face and insisted that the money was indeed paid to this person. The detectives then began to search and found 45 yuan in banknotes in Duan's pocket and 120 yuan in his trouser legs. Shao Zhenxiang identified all of these banknotes as being paid by the shop. The green tickets were stamped with the word "Xin," which was easy to identify. However, Duan still did not directly admit it, claiming that it was exchanged for a one-hundred-tael silver ticket, but the amount did not match. Therefore, the detectives took Duan and the banknotes to the patrol room and investigated the remaining money. Until 1:30 am yesterday morning, the Chinese and Western detectives went to Duan's house again to search and found 2,800 yuan in banknotes under the table in the kitchen. Together with the money found on Duan, only 35 yuan was missing. At this point, Duan also admitted that he had spent the missing 35 yuan because the stolen evidence was all there and he could not deny it. At 9:00, the two Shaos of Hengxiang were summoned and Duan and the stolen money were taken to the First Special District Local Court. Judge Liu Yugui interrogated him. After the patrol room lawyer Qian Xunjiu stated the case, he requested strict punishment because the defendant had intentionally embezzled other people's property. Judge Liu then clearly questioned all the witnesses and sentenced Duan Zhiyun to a fine of 400 yuan. If he was unable to pay, he would be allowed to offset it with one day of imprisonment for every three yuan. The seized banknotes were handed over to the original owner for collection, and the insufficient amount was deducted from Duan Zhiyun's original one hundred tael money. After the judgment, Duan stated that he would appeal, so he was ordered to pay 400 yuan for bail pending review during the appeal period.</p>

<p>The memorial service for Pastor Yu Guozhen, the founder of the Chinese Jesus Christian Self-Governing Church, was held at the Yongzhi Church on Xiangyin Road the day before yesterday. Representatives from all walks of life and guests attended the meeting, which was very grand for a time. The layout of the meeting place was extremely solemn. The horizontal plaque "Learning Morality and Loving People" from the Chairman of the National Government was hung high in the middle of the stage, and there were elegiac couplets from Chairman Jiang, Mayor Wu, National Government Committee Member Xue, Committee Member Wang, and Mr. Zhang Zhijiang, Dr. Chen Zhongsheng, Wang Xiaolai, Yu Qiaqing, Huang Hanzhi, Yuan Ludeng, Liu Zhanen, and Li Denghui on both sides.

The following is a record of the most noteworthy: Chairman Jiang's essay said, "Dropping tears and stroking the abandoned piano, the Mohist family mourns the same tune in the night rain. The wooden bell is covered with dust, and the Christian church in Shanghai loses its mentor." Mayor Wu's essay said, "Cool and refreshing, return to God's side, and the model is still praised by the world." Committee Member Xue's inscription is full of revolutionary spirit, "Achieving a great career, this is called immortality." The couplet said, "The spirit of the patriots shoots at the Taurus and the Big Dipper, and the career of the teacher shines in the world." Xie Yongqin's couplet said, "For 27 years, following in the footsteps, sighing that you are enduring hardship and labor, to complete self-government. 20,000 people admire the advanced, ask me for Chu talents to use, why bother attacking wrong other mountains."</p>
<p>Child Welfare Association Guarantees Work</p>
<h3 id="e144">| Six Cases Handled in One Month | <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>The establishment of the China Child Welfare Association was originally due to the fact that the President of the Association, Kong Xiangxi, considered that most children in China lack education and security. In addition to the child education, child health, child research and various child welfare undertakings undertaken by the Association, special attention is paid to child security work. It is reported that the Child Security Department of the Association has handled six abuse cases in one month: (1) Lin Yongrong of Parker Road, Public Concession, abused his maid Wang Azhen. As a result, the person concerned was sentenced to two months in prison and suspended for three years. The maid was sent to the Association for education. (2) Chen Dafu's wife on Wanzhu Street in the city abused his maid Chen Peilan. As a result, the person concerned was handled by the Public Security Bureau according to law, and the maid was sent to the Association for education. (3) Shen Xiangbo's wife in Shuxiang Lane, Caishi Road, French Concession, abused his maid Xu Qiulan. As a result, the inside story is still waiting, and the French patrol room has been temporarily asked to register and wait for a review. (4) Ke Xiaoting's wife in Kangti Lane, Kangti Fang, French Concession, abused his maid Chen Ruyi. As a result, the person concerned was handled by the patrol room according to law, and the maid was handed over to her biological mother for collection. (5) He Heting's wife on Beishan West Road, Public Concession, abused his adopted daughter Qian Jindi. As a result, because the situation was still good, the person concerned was warned by the patrol room, and the girl was handed over to He Heting's mother to raise her. (6) The third family in Yonganfang, Guangxi Road, Public Concession, bought a young girl and forced her to be a prostitute in a wild chicken hall. As a result, the Laozha Patrol Room sent the young girl to the court for questioning and arrested the person concerned.</p>
<h3 id="e145">Midwives' Compassionate Voyage <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>Ms. Tan Chengde is a famous lady from Changsha, specializing in obstetrics. She now has a clinic at No. 43 Zundeli, Xiamen Road. The consultation fee is very low, and she is compassionate. She does not charge anything for poor families. She is truly a compassionate voyage for mothers. On the opening day of the clinic, Zhang Xiaolin, Du Yuesheng, Zhang Xingyan, Gu Juliu, Liu Weijun, Fan Qianzhi, and others specially presented the four characters "籥籥生生", and also had a title inscription, which said, "The Book of Changes' words say, the great virtue of heaven and earth is to give birth, and giving birth is endless, so those who love life are the heart of heaven and earth. It is said that between heaven and earth, it is like a 籥? Puddle clay as a vessel, 籥 is infinitely useful. Obstetric medicine was called midwifery in our country in the past, those who give birth are born, and those who give birth are also born, and the capabilities of obstetric medicine are complete. Those who practice this are also the 籥 of giving birth. My niece Chengde is the daughter of General Tan Huanzhang. She specializes in obstetrics. After graduating, she gathered with her comrades and formed an obstetric clinic. Therefore, I took the meaning of 籥生生 and inscribed it to Zhang Zhi.

<h3 id="e146">Conflicts over Fence Removal Erupt Again <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>Number 48A Xú Road is the property of the Shanghai Bank and rented to a Mr. Chen as a residence. Next to it, at Number 54A Xú Road, is the privately run, unregistered Tongyi Middle School. Last month, the school attempted to expand its sports field by taking over the lawn of the Chen residence, but was refused. Unexpectedly, the school incited students to privately dismantle the bamboo fence, leading to a conflict in which Chen's male servant, Shen Chunhua, was beaten. This was reported in the "Times" on December 12th. Later, a Mr. Mao from the school went to the Chen residence to apologize and promised to ensure that the school's students would never cross the boundary fence again. The landlord had the destroyed bamboo fence repaired, and the school was to pay for the repairs and medical expenses, etc. However, this has not been done to date. Unexpectedly, before one wave subsided, another arose. A few days ago, the school's students (the same people who beat Chen's servant last time) came to play ball again. Chen discovered this and immediately reported it to the school's director. However, a teacher named Yang Yizhi started verbally abusing Mrs. Chen. Both parties went to the police station, where the police severely reprimanded the school's Dean. It is reported that the Chen family is preparing to file a lawsuit to prevent future disputes.</p>

<p>He Zhuoxian, Director of the Trademark Bureau of the Ministry of Industry, recently recognized the importance of promoting domestic goods. However, people often find it difficult to distinguish between domestic and foreign goods in the market due to the vast variety of products. Therefore, he has undertaken a very important task: compiling a "Trademark Compendium" that includes trademarks from various countries, divided into two major sections: East Asia and Europe, America, Africa, etc. The printing costs alone will be tens of thousands of dollars, indicating its meticulousness. The plan is to first publish the East Asia section of the Trademark Compendium. Director He and his colleagues are working day and night to complete it. It is expected to be finished in about a month. After publication, it will be distributed to all sectors so that everyone can have a copy and be able to identify goods based on the illustrations, avoiding confusion and making it easier to investigate. This is truly a significant new contribution to the promotion of domestic goods this year.</p>

<p>An elderly local woman, Xu Tao, who lives at Number 41 Masnan Road in the French Concession, was leading her three grandchildren, carrying one in her arms and leading two others, on the morning of the 9th of this month at 11:15 AM. They were walking westward at the intersection of Huanlong Road and Masnan Road. At that time, her five-year-old grandson, Gui Fu, was walking alone on the south side of the road, while the elderly woman and the others were walking on the north side. As they approached the Masnan Road intersection, Gui Fu suddenly crossed the road, running from south to north towards his grandmother. As he reached the middle of the road, a sedan driven by Shen Er, chauffeur to a certain Englishman with license plate number 7958, was traveling north on Masnan Road and turning west onto Huanlong Road. The car was unable to avoid the child and knocked him down, injuring his head and causing bleeding from his ears, rendering him unconscious. The police arrived and took the injured child to Guangci Hospital for treatment, and took the driver to the police station to report to the head officer for investigation. The child's brain injuries were too severe, and he died shortly after being admitted to the hospital. The hospital notified the police station, and the body was taken to the Tongren Fuyuan Funeral Home for an autopsy. Yesterday morning, the Transportation Department requested Deng Baosun, the prosecutor from the Second Special District Court, to come to the funeral home to examine the body. After the autopsy, he held a hearing to question the defendant and the grandmother of the deceased regarding the incident. He concluded that Xu Gui Fu had died from a head injury caused by being hit by a car. The body was released to the family, Xu Tao, after they signed a guarantee. The defendant was returned to the Transportation Department for legal proceedings.</p>

<h3 id="e157">Letter to the Editor <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>To the esteemed editor of the Shen Bao: I was shocked and dismayed to read the news item "Landlord Beats Tenant Over Rent" in your local news column on January 9, 1933. Our agency, which manages the rental property, has found that the tenant in Sanxin Lane, citing losses from the war, has been deliberately defaulting on rent for nine months (from May 1932 to January 1933, a total of nine months). Prior to May 1932, we had already exempted three months' rent in accordance with the municipal government's order. Despite our agency's kind persuasion and patience, we were unsuccessful. On the 6th of this month, because the rent collector insisted on collecting the rent, he provoked the anger of Dr. Jiao Fuyin and his wife, the tenants, leading to a conflict. The rent collector's friend saw the injustice and provided assistance, resulting in a mutual scuffle. The facts are all there, and police officers from the First Precinct of the Fifth District were present as witnesses. The report in your newspaper that "the landlord suddenly gathered more than ten people to beat the doctor and his wife severely, destroyed their belongings, and stole their clothes, etc." is completely untrue. We respectfully request that your newspaper correct this report. Sincerely, Chen Qun, lawyer, January 10.</p>

<p>Hangzhou Elementary School Teachers Take Collective Leave</p>
<h3 id="e159">City Government Responds by Paying Overdue Fees <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>Due to the provincial government's order to tighten the city government's operating expenses, all elementary school teachers in Hangzhou took collective leave. Mayor Zhao Zhihao, citing the difficulty of municipal development, firmly requested the withdrawal of the order and fought for it with his resignation. As a result, the salaries of elementary school teachers in the city for December of last year have not yet been paid, and the salaries for this month and the two installments of seniority pay are even more uncertain. All elementary school teachers, due to the lack of guarantee for their living expenses, had long intended to take collective leave as a passive resistance. After several consultations with the city government's education authorities, it was decided that the December educational expenses and the last seniority payment would be verified and issued separately on the 14th and 15th of this month. However, there is no definite date for the payment of this month's salary and the next seniority payment, and there are still discounts. Therefore, on the afternoon of the 9th, they took collective leave and convened more than 400 elementary school teachers in the Yousheng Guanxiang Elementary School to discuss countermeasures. They requested that the salaries for December and January and the two semesters of seniority pay be paid before the winter vacation, that the discounts be cancelled, and that the elementary school funding be independent. Tang Gensheng, He Jingwu, and four others were elected as general representatives to lead all the teachers to petition the city government. Mayor Zhao personally replied that 1) discounts would be eliminated and monthly salaries would be paid on time; 2) the unpaid part of the last seniority payment would be paid before the winter vacation within a possible range; 3) the regular expenses for December 1932 would be paid on January 14, and half of this month's expenses would be paid first.</p>
<p>Jiangning Elementary School Fee Arrears Dispute</p>
<h3 id="e160">▲ Jiangning Education on the Verge of Bankruptcy <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<h3 id="e161">▲ Financial Authorities Urged to Seek Reform Quickly <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>Jiangning elementary school education funds, because the financial authorities have historically been economically opaque, and the education bureau receives a varying amount of money each month from the financial bureau, which it has no power over and lacks independence. The fees for October 1931 are already four or five months behind, and then water disasters and national crises followed, and the financial bureau took this excuse to pay less educational funds. The money collected by Jiangning Educational funds through financial bureau on behalf of the district is 190,000 yuan per year, but the financial bureau sends only one or two thousand to the educational bureau per month. Even during festivals when more is allocated, the amount is only four or five thousand yuan. It is said that a former finance bureau chief paid the education bureau only a few hundred yuan per month when he was about to hand over the position, causing the education bureau to owe the primary schools more than ten months' worth of funds. The root cause of the arrears is that the peasants of Jiangning County do not pay their taxes directly to the financial bureau, but they are collected by the tax collectors on behalf of the bureau, and less is reported, though the county has a quota. However, the financial bureau failed to seriously address the situation, and the problem of embezzlement is more than enough. Overall it is said that the farmers cannot pay the tax, and sometimes when they do come up with the money, they say it is borrowed, which is nominally 'borrowed' but not collected. Ever since Chairman Chiang heard that Jiangning Educational fees were too far behind and were unsustainable, he summoned the heads of the financial and educational bureaus and asked them about the situation. On December 15, half a month of elementary school expenses were issued, and at the end of December, another month's expenses were issued. But the pain was too deep. Even though Chairman Chiang Kai-shek gave a shot of morphine, it only provided temporary relief and was not a permanent solution. It was recently heard that the Jiangning County Finance Bureau Director was taken over by County Chief Zhao, who expressed his active desire to sort things out and eliminate corruption and strictly fix the tax collection quota with tax collectors and enforce a collection policy instead of borrowing. Hopefully, the County Chief will earnestly handle matters and never again allow education in Jiangning county to fall into bankruptcy. It was also heard that Jiangning County elementary school teachers recently hosted newspaper reporters to report the details of the fees that were owed to them, and that some schools have already run out of food. It is hoped that the media will provide support.</p>
<p>After the Shandong Student Protest Was Resolved, the Senior High Schools Resumed Classes</p>
<h3 id="e162">Students Are Allowed to Attend Classes Starting on the 21st After Being Screened <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>Jinan Fast News: High school students in Shandong Province opposed old conferences, went on strike and boycotted class, and affected students from other schools such as Yizhong Zheng Yi, Ai Mei, Qi Lu, Zhen Hua and other eight schools. After the joint strike and petition, eight schools, including Yizhong, followed the orders of the Education Department and resumed classes separately. However, the senior high school students did not listen to the advice, so they had no choice but to disband them and order the students to leave the school and return to their hometowns to await screening. It is now heard that the middle school has followed the order of the Education Department and notified the parents of students in the first and second grades of the general course and the students in the third year of the liberal arts course and the lower grades of the science course, except for a few students who took the most initiative, who will be severely punished separately, and required each student to fill in the guarantee form and pay the fees from today (7th) to the 11th, and then move into the school to wait for screening. It is also heard that the students in the liberal arts and science courses in the third year and the lower grades of the science course had previously requested to be exempted from the exam, and then all withdrew from school. Most of the students had received withdrawal certificates, and a few students left without receiving them. Now most of the students have repented and jointly submitted a report to the school authorities, requesting to graduate and join the exam. The school authorities, considering the situation of each student, have submitted a report to the Education Department, and although they have received withdrawal certificates, they should be allowed to graduate to the 45 who the school deems fulfill their criteria. The school also held a graduation exam on the 6th. After the results of the exam are announced, it will be submitted to the Education Department for a graduation exam. According to He Siyuan, the head of the Education Department, although the students in the third year of the liberal arts and science courses who should have graduated from the winter vacation had previously withdrawn from school and received withdrawal certificates, some of them did not receive them, so the school allowed them to graduate in accordance with the regulations. The report came to the department, and those who took the initiative to withdraw during the turmoil were not allowed to submit repentance letters, while those who did not withdraw at the time were allowed to graduate. A total of 45 people were counted. The exam was held yesterday.</p>
<p>According to the person in charge of the school, the graduation exam of our school will be announced on the 9th, and those who pass will be sent to the Education Department for the joint exam. As for the students in the first and second grades and the upper grades of the third year of the school, they have been notified to fill in the guarantee forms and conduct a strict screening. The school is scheduled to hold the screening period from the 12th to the 15th of this month, and the class can start on the 18th. But at most it cannot be extended past the 20th. It is now heard that as of today (7th), more than 60 students have filled in the guarantee forms and paid fees to enter the school.</p>
<h3 id="e163">High School Curriculum Standards (5) <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>(4) In addition to lecturing on the regular curriculum, if there is extra time, supplementary teaching materials may be added in the classroom. However, students should be instructed to practice their note-taking skills, organize them neatly, and submit them to the teacher for evaluation. It is not advisable to compile lecture notes and distribute them to students.</p>
<p>(II) Key Teaching Points</p>
<p>(1) General Remarks: High school teaching materials are the second circumference of junior high school teaching materials, so there should be a real connection with the former.</p>
<p>(1) The earliest part of high school mathematics is the same as the junior high school teaching materials. It is advisable to select more difficult problems for review and to introduce deeper research.</p>
<p>(2) Junior high school mathematics focuses on the proficiency of calculation skills and the understanding of basic concepts. The research method is to summarize from examples and special cases into general rules. High school should focus on theoretical aspects, using deductive methods for more systematic research. Due to the complexity and depth of mathematical principles, junior high school students may not be able to fully understand them. Therefore, high school should reiterate the junior high school teaching materials, but with different levels of detail and different focuses, so that students will not be bored, and there will be a sense of reviewing the old and knowing the new, peeling cocoons and drawing silk.</p>
<p>(3) The high school mathematics subject only has twenty class hours, and there are as many as five or six compulsory courses. Instead of teaching too much material in detail and having students memorize it, it is better to focus on basic training and cultivate their ability to conduct research independently. Therefore, for solid geometry, higher algebra, and analytic geometry, only the main ideas need to be taught, but attention should be drawn when problems cannot be thoroughly explored to inspire students' ambition to pursue higher research.</p>
<p>(2) Algebra and Higher Algebra: High school algebra should focus on functions and equations.</p>
<p>(1) Students do not easily understand the concept of functions. Teachers should pay attention to explaining when deriving the variable values and signs of elementary functions in order to establish their foundation. The quadratic function is the most suitable example.</p>
<p>(2) Junior high school graduates can already understand the solutions of equations, so high school algebra should focus on the general properties of equations, the principle of equivalent solutions, and discussion of changes in solutions ("equations containing parameters") and increases or decreases ("such as the roots of fractional equations and irrational equations"). Quadratic equations are the gateway to equations and are most sufficient to train students' thinking.</p>
<p>(3) Higher algebra takes the theory of equations as the center. The existence of complex numbers is a prerequisite for the establishment of basic algebraic theorems. Determinants are a powerful tool for elimination. Although series are extreme operations and differ greatly from algebraic properties, all function expansions rely on them and are the basis of analytic geometry, so more attention should be paid to them.</p>
<p>(4) The application problems of equations are not only limited to daily facts but should also be linked to geometry, trigonometry, physics, and chemistry. The accuracy of the results obtained should be noted in practical problems. The numerical solution of high-order numerical equations has much practical use and should be known by those who study calculation. Probability is the core of statistics and should also be taught in general terms.</p>
<p>(3) Geometry: High school geometry should train students' ability to explore automatically and pay attention to the logical order so that they reach a considerable degree of rigor.</p>
<p>(1) Geometry places the greatest emphasis on logical order. Junior high school students are young and not easy to strictly adhere to it. High school geometry teaching should pay special attention to this training, but the degree of theoretical rigor is limited to what students can feel is necessary and can understand.</p>
<p>(2) Theorems that have been learned in junior high school should be dissected again using a heuristic method, and the method of inverse proof should be used as much as possible to clarify the path of thinking. The relationships between theorems should be used to form a system, showing the coherent thread of the entire geometry, so that students can grasp the key points and increase their ability to apply. However, the system should be based on theory to facilitate understanding and memory, and should not flow into rigid classification.</p>
<p>(3) Parts that have not been taught in detail in junior high school should be supplemented, and attention should be paid to the two parts of locus and construction problems. Therefore, in addition to reasoning and proof, these two parts can also develop students' ability to explore and invent.</p>
<p>(4) Geometric proofs and constructions should use algebraic methods as much as possible within the possible range to find the relationship between known components and unknown unsolved components.</p>
<p>(5) Solid geometry can only be taught in general terms, mainly to clarify the properties of equality and measurement methods, so that students can see through the circle on the plane and understand the structure of various solids, so as to be fully linked with the utensils used in drawing.</p>
<p>(4) Trigonometry: High school trigonometry should focus on trigonometric functions.</p>
<p>(1) Since acute-angle trigonometric functions and right-triangle solutions have already been learned in junior high school, high school can start with general-angle trigonometric functions for comparison and generalization. This not only seeks the universality of theory but is also necessary knowledge for those who study physics.</p>
<p>(2) The trigonometry taught in junior high school focuses on simplicity. High school should pay attention to the properties of trigonometric functions, trigonometric identities, equations, etc. (all should be compared with corresponding problems in algebra) for further study of higher mathematics.</p>
<p>(5) Analytical Geometry: High school analytical geometry should integrate algebra, geometry, and trigonometry to show where they are mutually useful. On the one hand, it serves as a general conclusion to the mathematics curriculum in secondary school, and on the other hand, it lays the foundation for advanced research.</p>
<p>(1) Analytical geometry should be mutually linked with algebra, geometry, and trigonometry to solve geometric problems and fully express the consistent nature of each part of mathematics.</p>
<p>(2) In order to obtain a corresponding relationship between graphics and quantities, it is necessary to use extended geometric elements. Therefore, analytical geometry cannot but differ from synthetic geometry (such as the problem of dividing angles). In all such places, it is best to make beginners pay attention to clarifying their views so that they are not confused.</p>
<p>(3) The scope of synthetic construction cannot be determined without analysis. If there is sufficient time, it is advisable to show construction impossibility (Lmpooodlecongtruction).</p>

<h3 id="e168">Spring Enrollment News of Suzhou Provincial High School <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>Suzhou Provincial High School is well-run and the largest in the province. The school's enrollment is divided into spring and autumn seasons. The number of classes depends on the number of graduates. At the end of this semester, there will be one class of high school and one class of junior high school graduates. Therefore, one new class of high school and one new class of junior high school will be recruited. However, since last year, the spring class of the high school department has only recruited chemical engineering students and does not accept general science students. Now, in order to meet the needs of society, in addition to recruiting one new class of high school and junior high school students in accordance with the regulations, 45 students will be recruited for remedial classes to facilitate the preparation of junior high school spring graduates for further education. Because spring graduates have difficulty in entering schools, many of them lose the opportunity to study. It is very strange not to remedy this situation. Therefore, the school has decided through a school affairs meeting on January 5 to add 45 remedial classes for relief. All recruitment regulations have been drafted. Those who are interested in applying can obtain them from the school. The examination period is February 2 and 3, and the registration period is from January 30 to February 1. It is said that those who request the prospectus are very enthusiastic.</p>

<h3 id="e169">Respectfully Advise National University and Middle School Students to Practice Education to Save the Country (14) <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>— You Huaigao</p>
<p>In this era of scientific prosperity in the 20th century, no one should oppose the current government's construction policies. However, my suggestion is to ask the government not to forget that construction in education is more important than construction in material things. Because before most people in the country have received education, 99 percent of the construction is still bamboo fences and thatched huts, small boats and carts, simple and crude utensils, cloth clothes and cloth shoes. At most, only one in ten thousand people is engaged in scientific construction. As a result, it is just a drop in the ocean and does not help. Although it takes a lot of effort, the results are limited. If we can simultaneously carry out construction in education, we can increase the knowledge and change the thinking of hundreds of millions of people. Then, most of the people can assist the government in construction according to the standards of the 20th century. This construction is endless, universal, real, and great. The lost credibility can be compensated with education to the people better than using gold, silver, and wealth to relieve them thousands of times. Because gold and silver will be used up, the source of knowledge can not only be used up in a lifetime but also be passed on to future generations. Therefore, if the government really dares to issue this education service order to educate the people, it is enough to save the people from deep water and scorching fire. This is the benevolence of Confucianism, the compassion of Buddhism, and the love of Christianity. Therefore, we do not need to borrow gold, silver, and goods from foreign countries. We only need to take the seeds of wisdom from the brain bank of national universities and middle schools and spread them in the brain fields of millions of people. The harvest after ten years will be too numerous to count.</p>
<p>If our government can be built on faith and love, its foundation can make it impenetrable to water and indestructible to fire. It will be as stable as Mount Tai and as hard as iron and stone. Its life can be as long as the heaven and earth and the universe. This is what I earnestly hope from the current government.</p>
<p>In terms of the people, whether they are intellectuals, bourgeoisie, or farmers and workers, they should wholeheartedly support the current government, meet with sincerity, implement persuasion and advice, and abolish laughter, scolding, and conspiracy. In the period of national crisis, smart people should do their best, rich people should contribute their financial resources, and strong people should contribute their physical strength. This is the expression that the people should have for the country and the government.</p>
<p>Therefore, I hope that the government will use the word "faith" to treat the upper-class people and the word "love" to treat the second-class people. I also hope that the people will use the word "sincerity" to treat the government and the word "strength" to treat the country. This is a prerequisite for saving the country through education.</p>
<h3 id="e170">(18) Moths to Destruction and Bees and Butterflies to Save the Country <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>Everyone laughs at the moth's attraction to fire and calls it foolish. Everyone says that the fly is greedy for its pursuit of stench. But we are drunk and dreaming day and night, living in this world of sensual pleasures in Shanghai. Isn't this an act of moths rushing to the fire? There is also a group of people who, day and night, do things that deceive, plunder, conspire, and kill. Isn't this the fly's pursuit of stench? Although everyone has to die, they have to die at the right time. Why must they learn from the moth's rushing to the fire and die? Although everyone seeks a livelihood, they must seek it properly. Why must they learn from the fly's pursuit of stench and live?</p>
<p>We first compare a bee and a fly, and we can understand this principle. Look at a small bee. They cooperate and work together. They love the sun and enjoy working. They are diligent and thrifty. They know how to save. They can also plan ahead. Their honey comes from diligence and thrift. It is taken from the price of spreading pollen work. The physique of the fly seems to be similar to that of the bee in form, but in terms of spirit, there is a distinction between the worthy and the unworthy.</p>
<p>Let's compare a butterfly with a moth again, and this principle can be understood even more. Look at how butterflies love nature, flying and dancing among the green willows and bright flowers. They are both insects. The moth's unchanging attitude of sinking to death is completely different from the butterfly's clear, superior, and leisurely attitude. Therefore, butterflies can live out their years and complete their lives, while moths die out. This is the difference between wisdom and foolishness.</p>
<p>I believe that you are bees and butterflies who save the country, not flies and moths who destroy the country. Therefore, do not forget our great work of brewing honey. Heaven has given us a great source of power to feed our many ethnic groups. It wants us to use artificial brainpower, physical strength, group power, machine power, and time power to take this natural solar power, earth power, water power, electric power, and gas power in order to cultivate wealth and create happiness. Therefore, we are bees and butterflies who save the country. Then, this city is definitely not a place for us to carry out long-term work. Learning the behavior of flies and moths will at least turn into fly-moth-like bees and butterflies. This is the most painful and dangerous thing. Please pay extreme attention.</p>
<p>Our millions of square miles of land are the richest places for solar and earth power. For cultivated fields, improve the species. For uncultivated fields, develop them. For unopened mines, extract them. This is considered to be taking solar and earth power. The Yellow River Basin, the Yangtze River Basin, and the Pearl River Basin are the richest places for water and electric power. Use them to generate electricity, irrigate, transport, and raise things. This is considered to be taking water and electric power. Use chemical methods and the effectiveness of machines to carry out widespread manufacturing. This is considered to be taking gas power.</p>
<p>Eliminate this large block of illiteracy and illiteracy. Use a few wise men to teach the majority of the ignorant. This is considered to be using brain power. Save physical strength and give most farmers and workers appropriate entertainment and rest. This is considered to be using physical strength. Have a close organization and the virtue of working together. This is considered to be using group power. Widely use machines and cherish machines. This is considered to be using machine power. Lazy people must cherish their time and not be too relaxed. Diligent people must also save time and not overwork. And we must improve the system and look at the time. This is considered to be using time power.</p>
<p>Therefore, you should understand how great your responsibility to the country is and how heavy your affairs are. During this period of national crisis, we cannot allow countless useful bees and butterflies to stay in this city and imitate these greedy and foolish flies and moths to do some frivolous work and just be done with it. Therefore, if you want to save the country, you must resolutely leave Shanghai and go to the countryside in the interior to do the work of saving the country through education.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Education issued an order yesterday to the privately-run Nanyang Commercial High School, stating: Upon investigation, the school held high school and junior high school graduation examinations on January 9th. This bureau sent personnel to supervise the examinations. According to the report, during the high school examination on domestic and foreign exchange, student Li Yi Wu, number 8, colluded with Huang Ruo Han, number 4, who was sitting next to him, to cheat. He should be immediately retained and not be allowed to take the graduation examination again, in order to deter others and maintain academic integrity. Furthermore, the teacher in charge of that subject arrived in the classroom twenty minutes late, which is highly inappropriate and should be reprimanded to emphasize the importance of examinations. This order is to be obeyed immediately.</p>

<p>Zhao Ding family of Sanlintang Sanzhutang, is generous and charitable. They contribute to local public welfare. Indeed, they are a heroic figure among women. Last year, Sanlin School, in order to commemorate the achievements of the founder, initiated the Wen Yi Library. In addition to soliciting books from all sectors, there was a proposal to construct a library building. The principal, Mr. Ding Guanyan, is a nephew of the family. He usually planned school affairs with great effort. One day, there was a banquet for some matter and the family was also present. Mr. Ding brought up the previous proposal and solicited donations from them. The family immediately pledged 1,000 yuan without hesitation, saying that their residence is next to the school. They usually hear the sounds of study, and often think of the immeasurable merits of the elders in the village, and admire them in their heart. This small amount is not a great help to the school, but it is a small contribution from them. Those present said that they had heard that the first installment of 500 yuan had already been paid. The school plans to start construction in the next semester, and the library site is in the school grounds.</p>

Various facilities, such as books and instruments, have been purchased, in addition to some transferred from the school's high school department, to meet the needs of both departments. They are currently being arranged and renovated. As soon as the work is completed, they will begin operations at the new location.</p>

<p>The China Textile Society, in order to train textile factory workers and young people aspiring to the textile industry and cultivate technical personnel for the textile industry, established the Shanghai West Textile Night School. Preparations began in December of last year, and students were enrolled on the 4th and 6th of this month, with 70-odd people admitted. The school is temporarily using Zhaoji Middle School in Caojiadu as its location. Classes started today. The opening ceremony was held in the auditorium of that middle school at 9 a.m. yesterday, with over a hundred people attending. Director Huang Yunqiu of the school presided, and Qian Guanyi avoided the ceremony. After the meeting opened as usual, the chairman gave an opening speech and reported on the preparatory process. Then, Society members Zhu Xianfang, Wang Yuxiu, Zhao Guoliang, and several students gave speeches, mostly focusing on striving to study, improving technology, developing the textile industry, and solving the clothing problem, one of the four major needs of the people's livelihood advocated by Sun Yat-sen, resisting foreign goods, and saving China. Finally, the chairman gave a speech, and the meeting adjourned after a group photo.</p>

<p>Who Will Win the Championship? Watch This Battle (Southeast vs. Basketball Team)</p>
<p>The Western Youth Women's Basketball League comes to a close today. Since defeating Southeast, the Liangjiang team has been in first place and has a good chance of winning the championship. However, Liangjiang's opponent tonight is the Green Team from the Rowing Association. This team is very strong and has only lost to Southeast once (in the previous game between the Green Team and the American Ladies, the Green Team lost, but because the American Ladies used unregistered players, the victory was forfeited, and the victory still belongs to the Green Team). If they defeat Liangjiang today, the championship will not be settled, forming a three-way tie between Southeast, Liangjiang, and the Green Team. Therefore, Liangjiang must put forth their full effort tonight and not relax in the slightest. The schedule and team standings are as follows:</p>

<p>West Youth Basketball Pirate is Fierce John Fights Valiantly but Loses</p>
<h3 id="e186">Qingguang Defeats US Navy 39-30 <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>John's University basketball team put forth its full effort to contend with the Pirates last night at the West Youth Basketball Association, almost trapping the Pirates. John lost by only nine points, with a score of 39-30. In the second game, Qingguang defeated the US Navy 29-22. There is no game tonight.</p>
<h3 id="e187">John's Basketball Skills Advance Rapidly <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>John's performance last night was a case of looking at someone with new eyes after being apart for only three days. The entire team's basketball skills suddenly advanced rapidly, with pure and skilled coordination and quick shots. They were on par with the Pirates, which made the Pirates feel threatened. It is a pity that their shooting accuracy was not as good as theirs, resulting in an inability to do anything.</p>
<h3 id="e188">Overwhelming Pirates in the First Half <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>In the first half, Chen Xianglong won the jump ball twice. Cheng Jingxing passed the ball to the corner, and Yuan Maoquan made two shots under the basket, all of which were successful, resulting in a 4-0 lead. The Pirates immediately countered and tied the game. However, Xianglong and Jingxing reached the basket again, and John overwhelmed the Pirates again with a score of 8-4. However, in the next eight minutes, the Pirates caught up and scored 15 points, surpassing John with a score of 9-8. The situation changed. John rallied, and the first half ended with the Pirates leading 23-16.</p>
<h3 id="e189">Tense Situation Reappears <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>In the first ten minutes of the second half, a tense situation suddenly reappeared. John scored four consecutive baskets, and the Pirates made one free throw. In the midst of the chaotic lines, John tied the game at 24-24. It is a pity that this situation shifted again in an instant. The Pirates also scored four consecutive baskets, making it 32-24. John planned a counterattack, but the Pirates' defense was too tight, and there was no way to advance. Few long shots were successful, and hope was lost. The game ended 39-30, with the Pirates winning.</p>

<p>Qingguang played very casually. The score difference with the Navy was usually five, six, three, or four points, which was very close. The Navy resisted fiercely. In the first half, Qingguang only won by two points with a score of 13-11. The second half was the same, and Qingguang won by seven points with a result of 29-22.</p>

<h3 id="e194">Financial Gold Market Drifting Without Definite Direction <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>(Increased by Five Taels and Two Mace) According to foreign news yesterday, London big bars increased both short-term and long-term by one or two, Bank of America rose by two-five, British-American and American-British exchange rates both rose by half a cent and three-seven-five, forward silver market rose by four percent, American cotton slightly increased by five-six pounds. Therefore, the opening was flat at 798 taels and 8 qian. The opening of the bank exchange market was also flat, with the near-term British exchange rate quoted at one shilling and eight pence zero six two five, and the American exchange rate at twenty-eight yuan. After the opening, the market tended to tighten. Sellers from the previous day came to buy back, raising the price to 805 taels. This was because HSBC's listing continued to increase, with the shilling increasing by one two one and the US dollar increasing by two five. People's confidence was dampened, and there was an urgent demand from downstream buyers. The United States had preparations to purchase 250 million silver ounces for subsidiary coins.</p>
<p>According to a New York Reuters dispatch on January 9, Senator Dill (Washington) today proposed a bill to issue silver exchange coupons. This silver exchange coupon requires the Ministry of Finance to prepare to purchase silver worth 250,000,000 yuan. This exchange coupon can legally pay all kinds of debts. This silver is purchased on the market, with a maximum limit of one yuan and two jiao and a half per tael.</p>
<p>Then Dadecheng and other sellers sold bars, and the price fell to 796 taels and a half. Banks still had a good appetite, and the Central Bank repeatedly considered opening cash, so the price returned to over 800 taels. Hengxing and Fuyu and others slightly bought, and the market turned stable again. The amount of bars was dry, and each company did not have a large amount of trading, so the price hovered, and people's confidence was unstable. The market situation was also vague. The market first showed an upward trend, to zero five taels and two qian. Then, the Bombay report rose, and the market turned downstream again. Trading was still extremely scattered. Although the price fell to zero one taels, the exchange market had not yet turned hard. Hengxing slightly accepted, and then saw three taels. There were multiple ups and downs. Finally, the market closed at zero three taels and six qian. In summary, the gold market was boring all day, the exchange market was numb, and people's confidence was extremely unstable. However, the trend seemed stable. The Central Bank repeatedly considered taking action, but ultimately there were few transactions due to price disagreements. The total number of transactions was roughly only five or six hundred bars (because the gold price was vague, it was not easy for each company to find a replacement). The market situation for the entire day is recorded on the left.</p>
<h3 id="e195">Morning Market Advances and Retreats Around 800 Taels <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>The morning opened with a jump of half a tael, at 798 taels and 8 qian. Items were slightly set out, falling to 8 taels and 1 qian. Meifeng bought American dollars for the current month at twenty-eight yuan. The exchange market seemed good. Qingfa, Yongchang, Shengyong, Heng, Yu came to buy bars, breaking through 800 taels. American dollars for February at zero six two five were not easy to obtain. People's confidence was optimistic. Yuanmao, Yongyuan, Hengheng, Yu, Fuyu, Zhifeng, Yongjing tended to buy, reaching around 804 taels. But Hengxing suddenly came to buy bars on behalf of a customer, and general retail investors also covered their short positions, raising the price to zero five taels. However, because the amount of bars was not large, there was an immediate decline, but it could still be supported. Later, it was known in advance that the listing would continue to increase. In addition, Reuters reported that the United States had the motivation to purchase over 20,000 silver ounces as subsidiary coins. Daxing, Yongyifeng, Yong sold bars, and the price saw a small decline. But at this time, there were still several twists and turns. When HSBC's listing was announced, the British exchange rate increased by one two five, and the American exchange rate increased by two five. The exchange market instead tended to loosen. Meifeng sold American dollars for January at zero six two five (latter half of the month). Brokers all came to sell, and Dadecheng, Qianchangxiang, Hongli, and items were sold aggressively, falling to within the 800-tael mark. American dollars for March at one two five could be settled, so the price fell to ninety-six taels and five qian. The companies did not see a surge in selling, so the price did not continue to decline. But the exchange market was extremely clumsy. Thereafter, American dollars for March at one eight seven five were all wanted. Hengyu first came to slightly buy, and Qianchangxiang and Dadecheng also came to buy. Fellow traders thought that the Central Bank was coming to open cash again. The price was raised to around nine taels. Zhifeng and Yongna bought, rising to above 800 taels. One two five could be bought. Therefore, although the price rose to zero two taels and one qian, the market situation was flat and there was no further rise. There were few transactions, so the price was between one and two taels. Retail investors and items came to raise and suppress each other. Then, Zhifeng and Yongtuo sold, breaking through the 800-tael mark again, reaching ninety-nine taels. The market situation was boring again for a long time. Dadecheng came to buy bars again, and everyone suspected that they were acting for the Central Bank, so the price rose to zero one taels. But there were not many takers. Fuyu, Dadecheng, and Hengxing continued to buy, and Zhengjin bought January at ninety-three seven five. Hengyu also echoed and bought, raising the price to above zero four taels. However, people's confidence was shaky. Tianfeng and Yong Zhaofengchang saw the high price and sold, falling to zero two taels and two qian again. At this time, it was near the closing of the market. The price rose by several qian due to continued retail investor covering. The final closing price was zero two taels and five qian. Items were auctioned at zero two taels and eight qian.</p>
<h3 id="e196">Market Falls into a Boring State <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>The afternoon opened at 802 taels and 8 qian, hovering between two taels and three taels. This was because major players were watching, and the face was getting drier. When the bank wanted to buy American dollars for February at twenty-eight yuan, Fuyu bought, rising to around four taels. Yifeng and Yong followed and bought, reaching zero five taels and two qian. The Bombay report said that the price had risen by three annas. Zhaofengchang was the first to sell, and Qingfa and Yong Hengyu also sold, falling to around three taels. Six two five American dollars for March could be settled. Zhifeng sold, and Zhaofengchang and Hengyu's willingness to sell did not diminish, gradually falling to zero one taels. But the exchange market was numb and did not loosen slightly. Although one two five American dollars for April were not easy to sell, one eight seven five had many buyers. Hengxing repeatedly bought bars, but the amount was not large, so although the price rose continuously, it mostly hovered. Hongli and others also bought, rising to above four taels. Dadecheng sold on behalf of customers, falling to within zero three taels. It was quiet for a long time. Later, because Hengxing and Dadecheng competed to buy bars, the news of the Central Bank opening cash rose again in the market, rising to above four taels. Items and retail investors waited for the quota to be full before selling, so the price was repeatedly seen struggling around four taels. Finally, Qingfa Yong suppressed the price, reaching around three taels. But because it was time to close the market, both buyers and sellers were not excited, so the market closed in boredom at 803 taels and 5 qian. Items were auctioned at zero three taels and seven qian. The highest price for the whole day was 805 taels and two qian, and the lowest price was 796 taels and five qian, with a difference of seven taels. As a result, the closing price was higher than the previous closing price by five taels and two qian.</p>
<h3 id="e197">Trading Extremely Monotonous <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>In total, Zhaofengchang, Yideng Yong, Yifeng, Daxing Yong, Qingfa Yong, and others sold. Hengxing, Qianchangxiang, Hongli, Fuyu, Zhifeng Yong, Dadecheng, and others bought. Yuanheng, Yuanmao Yong, Yongfeng, and others bought. In addition, Hengyu, Fuchang, Tianfeng Yong, and others bought first and then sold. The Guangdong gang Wanxing bought and sold a little. Shunli sold a little. The Guangdong gang Hengxing bought a total of six or seven hundred bars and sold two or three hundred bars. Among them, except for one or two hundred bars bought by the Central Bank, the rest were on behalf of customers. Yifeng sold a little. The entire city was extremely scattered. Each company had no definite goal, so the market situation and people's confidence were extremely shaky.</p>
<h3 id="e198">Hamachi Market Situation Still Good <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>Calculated according to Jia Jiu taels, Tongfengheng and others bought in the market, with three or four hundred taels traded. The overall trend will not decline.</p>
<h3 id="e199">Swap Transactions Silent <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>Although Yingfengheng gave one qian and a half to Hengxing in the afternoon, it was for settlement in February and was not transferred to the exchange. It was Yingfengheng settling the January futures mark for Hengxing. Its spot price was smaller than the February price by one qian and a half, which was actually the same as a swap. Otherwise, there was silence.</p>

<p>The transactions of major companies in the gold industry have changed slightly compared to before the closing of the customs. The bulls include Yuanxin, Yong Qingfa Yong, Run Changyu, Tongfengheng, Zhaofengchang, Fuchang, and others, with Hengxing being the most numerous (formerly a bear). The bears include Yuanmao Yong, Dadecheng Chun, Yuanyong, Daxing Yong, and others as the largest. However, most are less than two thousand bars.</p>
<h3 id="e201">Big Bars Near and Far Shrink Zero Six Two Five <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>A National Society dispatch from London on the 10th said that the big bars near and far have shrunk zero six two five. The near term is sixteen pence and seventy five, and the far term is sixteen pence and eight one two five. The British-American exchange rate opened at three yuan and three jiao and a half.</p>
<h3 id="e202">Currency Market Correction Slightly Tight <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>▲Morning opening once trended firm... Fluctuations throughout the city were around 125.</p>
<p>Yesterday's exchange market, like the gold market, was both dazed and numb. Initially, a large telegram reported a rise to 125. The Bank of America rose by 25, and the exchange rate also increased slightly. The forward silver price was 4% higher. Private telegrams from banks also added 3.125, bringing the near-term rate for British exchange to 1 shilling 8 pence 0.0625, and the US exchange rate to 8 yuan. Compared to the previous close, the British exchange was slightly firmer, while the US exchange was flat. After the opening, due to some short-covering, the market tightened. The bid price also rose, making the exchange market even better. News from foreign telegrams that the United States planned to purchase silver ounces immediately struck a blow. HSBC's listed prices also rose by 125 for British exchange and 25 for US exchange, gradually trending towards a firm stance. Later, it turned back again, and finally, it was very peaceful, with uncertain trends. Trading was also not lively. In the gold industry, it was tight in the morning and slightly loose in the afternoon. Bank of America continued to issue US dollars, Sassoon was tight on British gold. In addition, banks were seen plugging and selling from time to time. The fluctuation throughout the city was around 125. At the end of the day, the British exchange was slightly tighter by 0.0625, and so was the US exchange.</p>
<p>(British Exchange) The morning opening was slightly firmer than the previous close, with the near-term asking price at 1 shilling 8 pence 0.0625. Banque Belge pour l'Etranger first sold March at 125, Citibank ate slightly. Standard Chartered and Citibank did the same month at the same price. HSBC offered January at 1 shilling 8 pence, Sassoon offered and Citibank then advanced March at 0.0625. American Express sold and Mitsui ate March at the same price. Sassoon offered and Xingye ate February at 0.0625. The afternoon close for January was bid at 9375, February and March were both 1 shilling 8 pence, and April was 0.0625. In the afternoon, Banque Belge pour l'Etranger advanced February at 8 pence, Sassoon sold. Citibank advanced January at the same price, Shanghai sold. Mitsui and Sassoon traded 125. The closing bid price for June was 1 shilling 7 pence 9375 for January, 8 pence for February and March, 0.0625 for April, and the asking price was increased by 0.0625.</p>

<p>Yesterday (the 10th), the bond market of the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange was characterized by extreme price volatility due to the still perilous situation and numerous rumors in the market, leading to unstable investor sentiment. The market was initially weak during the morning opening auction. However, the emergence of reports suggesting a resolution to the "Yu Case" gradually sparked buying interest, leading to increasing prices across various issues. The two trading sessions around midday marked the period of greatest firmness, with the highest prices exceeding the morning opening by varying amounts, ranging from several "jiao" to 2.6-2.7 yuan, and a significant surge of 1-2.5 yuan compared to the previous day. The market situation was exceptionally favorable at one point. However, the market experienced another setback during the closing session, with reports of continued tension in the northern situation and the unlikelihood of a peaceful resolution to the "Yu Case". This led to a sudden surge in sell orders, leaving buyers powerless and causing a sharp decline of 8-9 "jiao" to 1.5 yuan. In particular, the "19 Customs" issue experienced a dramatic fall of 1.7-1.8 yuan. The chaotic market conditions were unprecedented in recent times. Ultimately, prices generally continued to rise compared to the previous day. However, aside from customs duties, which alone rose by several yuan, and the whole six-month futures and the "20 Series, January" issues, which gained about 1 yuan each, other issues only improved by around half a yuan. Considering the recent surrounding circumstances and the overall situation, the market is indeed perilous, with numerous challenges ahead, making optimism premature. Trading volume in the futures market was very high throughout the day, reaching over 14.7 million yuan. However, spot trading remained limited to only 6,000 yuan.</p>

<p>The New Feng Foreign Firm reported (9th) that the New York stock market was firm initially, then tired. The total number of railway freight cars was 406,779, only a decrease of 87,801 from the previous week, which was beyond expectations. Also, the profit for November was still good, so railway stocks tended to be firm. Short covering also surged, resulting in gains in all stocks. Towards the end of the closing, there were sudden sell-offs, and the trend turned tired. The total trading volume for the day was 830,000 shares. The Dow Jones Index is listed below:</p>

<p>The yarn market was flat in the morning and rose in the afternoon, making the trend very difficult to grasp. Most people are optimistic about the high prices, because the situation of foreign cotton yarn is relatively firm, so there are more bulls. However, the Japanese invasion is still fierce, so it is really difficult to have a major development. In the afternoon, it was heard that public bonds rose slightly, and people's hearts were excited, and it suddenly rose.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Marked Yarn Exchange opened the morning session with calm U.S. cotton, but the atmosphere in the market was extremely deserted.

Yesterday, factories with real needs purchased smoothly and healthily, and people's hearts are tight. The pulling force of buyers is very strong, but the near-month delivery chips have been sufficient, so the pressure in March is still heavy. As for inquiries about the prices in various producing areas, they are said to be exceptionally firm and high.</p>

<p>(West Shanghai) Yesterday, the source in the South City was number 120. Spot sales in the market were sluggish. Although bulk sales existed, only Tianjin and Qinggang handled more than 2,000 "shi". The situation turned weak. The thin rice market softened. High-quality goods were still able to stand firm, while medium and lower grades seemed weak. Due to the small arrivals of Suzhou and Tonggang rice, sales were active, and the price was high by 1 "chi". Changbang rice was also short of goods, and medium-grade goods rose by about 1 "jiao". Yin Yuan and thick rice, Duyang Jian, etc., did not see much glory or disgrace. Spot inventory is weak. If the source does not surge, the market situation may have a chance to turn around.</p>
<p>(Zhabei) Yesterday, few boats arrived downriver. Wholesalers of white rice and shop sales were sparse. The market situation suddenly rose by 2-3 "jiao". There was continued source of early thin rice. Tianjin bulk sales were slightly digested, and retail sales were mediocre. The market surface was thinly determined. Early rice tightened by several "fen". Few shipments of Dujian rice arrived and retail sales continued, with prices increasing by 1 "jiao". The arrival and sales of Ganbu Jian were balanced, and the market carried a tight appearance. Not much white yuan rice arrived, and sales were quite active, with prices rising nearly 1 "chi". Arrivals of Yin Yuan were low and sales were smooth, and the price carried a tight appearance.</p>
<h3 id="e217">Marked Flour Market Led by Spot Sales <a href="#e217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's flour market presented weakness in the morning. Western ginseng flour decreased by about 0.35 "jiao", and people's hearts for the near and distant terms were tired. Also, there were no major bullish absorption, and the declines from the previous close ranged from 7.5 "li" to 1.25 "fen". However, when the afternoon market opened, the hearts of people for near and distant terms suddenly became firm because the Northern customer gang continued to buy in batches, such as Tianjin and Yingkou, and Xinda opened 40,000 bags to be delivered at the Green Fort. The price was 1 tael 9 "qian" 4.5 "fen". Fuxin has been out of stock for a long time, and orders are scheduled for February. Fufeng still adds 8 "fen" according to the standard. Therefore, most people's hearts are tied to the smooth tightness of spot sales. Standard buying also became tighter. February, due to factory short covering, rebounded by 3 "fen" compared to the lowest price of the previous market. Because February will soon approach the price reduction of spot goods, the result was that this month was good by 7.5 "li", February was good by 1.75 "fen", March, April, and May were good by 7.5 "li", and June was unchanged.</p>
<h3 id="e218">Wheat Market Temporarily Difficult to Develop <a href="#e218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the futures wheat market showed a flat and tired appearance. Foreign wheat quotations fell by 3-5 "jiao", and people's hearts inevitably saw emptiness. Although trading was still not smooth in the morning sessions, the opening prices had already fallen. The first session in the afternoon was still flat. Subsequently, traders sold short, in a small number, and the flour market was also tired and then stable. People's hearts were slightly firm. The result was that this month was good by 1 "fen", February was down by 0.3 "fen" in the morning and did not open in the afternoon, March was down by 1 "fen", and April was unchanged. The flour and wheat situation is temporarily difficult to develop. It will not be until the chips that the traders have re-established are all in place that there will be a colorful scene.</p>
<p>Also, on the 9th, the Chicago wheat market rose because the Liverpool price was firm, but then fell because Winnipeg was weak. May was at 48.0, July was at 47.625, and September was at 48.375. Also, on the 8th, 20 million bags were traded.</p>

<p>Yesterday's Ke Xian sales were dull in the northern part of the city because a batch of thin rice was shipped out, and the appetite for Ke Xian rice was slightly halted. However, according to opinions from professionals and people in the northern gang, Tianjin and the coastal ports of Zhilu will need to continue arranging for Ke Xian rice transactions in the future. However, due to the encroachment of downriver Du Jing rice, the number of arrangements is limited. Roughly before the end of the lunar year, there must be a large batch of New Year goods stored. There were daily accommodations for sporadic transactions. Although sales were dull in the north yesterday, the southern gang followed up. The appetite of the Fujian gang was originally smooth, but it was temporarily halted due to the transshipment of Du rice and inquiries from the northern gang. As sales in the north were dull yesterday, arrangements were immediately made. The northern gang still accommodated 200 bags of Hunan machine oil, and the Min Quanzhou gang sold 263 bags of Hunan oil, 624 bags of machine red rice, and 280 bags of Jiangxi machine late rice. The stock of machine red rice was low, and the price alone rose beyond 1 "jiao". The price opened at 9 yuan and 8 yuan 9.5 "jiao". Machine late Xiang oil each rose nearly 1 "jiao". Machine late rice was at 9 yuan 1 "jiao" 3 "fen", and Hunan machine oil rice was at 9 yuan 1 "jiao" 2 "fen" to 5 "fen". The soybean market was still weak, and sales slightly made inquiries. If there are no large batch sales in the future, it will be a temporary transition. Manufacturers arranged for 3 cars of Dalian beans, and the Guangdong gang arranged for 700 bags of Pudong Du beans. 400 bags of Chongming sand yellow and Suzhou soybeans were arranged for by this street. 20 tons of Zheng Tao Guan soybeans were also arranged for by manufacturers. The mainland gang purchased 100 bags of Dalian red grain, and the Guangdong gang inquired about 30 bags of Jiujiang milk hemp. A total of more than 460 bags of peanuts were transacted. This street went to sales, and the oil market was quiet in various sales markets. Only this street still had hoarding, and the market presented ordinariness.</p>

<p>Yesterday's sugar market trend was firm and stable. The Public Association's price division for 24 crude granulated sugar was 15 taels 9.5 "qian", and high-quality goods were 16 taels 0.05 "fen". Dutch red sugar rose, with numbers 8 and 9 divided to 12 taels 6.5 "qian", up about 1 "qian" compared to the previous day. Since the price of new Chao Qing came in, it has been difficult to divide, and the numbers have been consistently defended. Therefore, yesterday's market price turned up 2 "qian". Over a thousand bags were transacted. The high-quality goods were from 9 taels second grade to 8.5 taels. The fourth grade Qing goods were 7 taels 4 "qian". The number of Lake red sugar was small, and it was especially tight, also up 2 "qian" compared to the previous day. Over 200 pieces were opened, with prices at 12 taels 3 "qian" to 2 "qian". It is said that the next batch of Chao Qing goods will continue to arrive soon, but there is no hope of relaxation.</p>

<p>After the Hankou Kai Xiang tung oil offered 13 taels of customer offer, traders immediately approved 12 taels 8 "qian" of foreign precedent grains. Then, it once showed well, adding 2 "qian", and then fell back. The foreign bank oil still offered 17 taels 5 "qian" of foreign standard, but there were not many transactions, only dozens to hundreds of tons. The market has fallen to this point, and of course there is no fear of falling again. However, the desire to be good is impossible for a while. Therefore, although the Hankou market is stable, it does not seem to be the time for a turnaround. As for the Zhejiang tung oil market, even if it is slightly sluggish, it only rises and falls by 3-4 "jiao". It is said that the current market sufficient inventory is offered at 22 yuan per "zhu" Jiang delivery. Sellers seem to be unwilling because of cost considerations, and buyers are not surprised. There is nothing to greed for in both the choice and the abandonment, because the market can explode and drop sharply, which can attract people, but it meanders and revolves and has been lacking in scenery for a long time, causing people not to pay attention.</p>
<p>Attached is a telegram from overseas. On the 7th, the London Chinese Tung Oil market was at 39.6 pounds per 120 pounds. New York Tung Oil rose slightly to 4.25 to 375 per pound.</p>

<p>British galvanized iron prices have risen steadily and arrivals are scarce, which has led to a sudden rise in the standard. Yesterday, brokers and hoarders collected again, and the market became even more popular. The current market price for 7-foot sheets can be opened to 1 tael 05 "fen", 6-foot sheets can be opened to 8 "qian" 5 "fen", 28 gauge at 12 taels 5 "qian", 26 gauge at 11 taels 7.5 "qian", and 24 gauge at 11 taels 5 "qian". There were more than 800-900 "dan" of transactions on the market, but the underlying inventory felt more empty after the big purchase.</p>
<p>Also, according to a Reuters London dispatch on the 9th, copper, tin, lead, and zinc all rose. Antimony and tin did not change. A New York telegram reported that black iron sheet (24 gauge, 13 sheets per "chu", 120 pounds) was at 2.15 per 100 pounds. Galvanized iron sheet (24 gauge, 50 sheets, 1 "xiang", 600 pounds) was at 2.85 per 100 pounds. Tinplate was at 4.25 per box.</p>

<p>— Recluse Cuckoo</p>
<p>Since the wooden clog-wearing cavalry trampled over the three northeastern provinces, more than a year has swiftly passed. Of the millions of soldiers in all of China, besides the 19th Route Army and the 5th Army, and the garrison at Yuguan, one cannot help but feel a sense of "not a single man among them." Fortunately, there are righteous soldiers who vow to resist Japan, enduring ice and snow as they fight the enemy. They have struggled for over a year, and countless patriotic heroes have sacrificed themselves for the country, their names unknown. We, who have survived them, want to comfort the souls of these nameless heroes, but we do not know where to begin! Yesterday, I discovered in an old manuscript a poem by the late poet Jiang Guanyun (Zhiyou), "Elegy for the Daring Ones, Past and Present." I hastily transcribed several pages, weeping towards the Northeast, bowing and burning them. If the heroic souls are aware, they will surely acknowledge these words as those of a discerning friend.</p>
<p>A noble man does not cling to life, and laughs at the butcher's knife.</p>
<p>The butcher's knife is sharp and flat.</p>
<p>In an instant, it is applied on the road,</p>
<p>Flesh and blood pickled in the mud and dust,</p>
<p>It is still better than being trapped in the source of the barbarian water,</p>
<p>As a bedridden, sourly moaning bitterly. (One)</p>
<p>Sharpen the knife again and again.</p>
<p>Hold it to kill pigs and sheep,</p>
<p>Sharpen the knife again and again,</p>
<p>Heroes mostly die because of this,</p>
<p>Sheep and pigs and heroes,</p>
<p>How can they not be divided in two,</p>
<p>Sheep and pigs are for food,</p>
<p>The human world is full of steaming and tasting,</p>
<p>Heroes are sacrificed,</p>
<p>The happiness of all beings is abundant. (Two)</p>
<p>A man embraces hot blood,</p>
<p>A hundred years waiting for a scattering,</p>
<p>Where is the scattering?</p>
<p>Green mountains and green history,</p>
<p>Green mountains give birth to brilliance,</p>
<p>The glorious events of the previous dynasty,</p>
<p>Green history gives birth to brilliance,</p>
<p>Flying high inspires people to rise,</p>
<p>Future fragrant people,</p>
<p>Butcherous drunkard of the time,</p>
<p>Butchering drunkard smiles,</p>
<p>Smiling, why bother with this? (Three)</p>
<p>Even if ants eat my flesh,</p>
<p>Ants also eat my fat,</p>
<p>Dogs also lick my blood,</p>
<p>Worms also pierce my bones,</p>
<p>I heard the words of the Buddhist family,</p>
<p>Using the body as alms,</p>
<p>If it benefits things,</p>
<p>Why is it not enough to describe it as a mess? (Four)</p>
<p>Straw mat as shroud,</p>
<p>Axe as containing jade,</p>
<p>Life values ​​heroism,</p>
<p>Not enough to fill the blessed shell,</p>
<p>You see heroic people,</p>
<p>Their spirit is still in their eyes,</p>
<p>How many are buried thickly,</p>
<p>Over the years, it turns into stone bones,</p>
<p>Stone bones sometimes run out,</p>
<p>Heroic names never fall. (Five)</p>
<p>Prisoners and executioners,</p>
<p>How respectful are they to me?</p>
<p>Hesitantly watching with affection,</p>
<p>As if surrounding their children and grandchildren,</p>
<p>What are you doing?</p>
<p>Not enough to say a word,</p>
<p>Right and wrong and merits and demerits,</p>
<p>Entrust to the discussion of all ages. (Six)</p>
<p>Cattle sometimes succumb to the yoke,</p>
<p>Mantis sometimes blocks the car,</p>
<p>The body of the ox is not small,</p>
<p>Muddy and boastful,</p>
<p>The body of the mantis is not small,</p>
<p>The spirit is like swallowing the remainder,</p>
<p>Valuing the people's spirit for the country,</p>
<p>The strong and the weak differ from this,</p>
<p>They strive for freedom to die,</p>
<p>Would they rather live as slaves? (Seven)</p>
<p>Dying of illness is the most unfortunate,</p>
<p>I used to say this,</p>
<p>Rotten scholars list the five blessings,</p>
<p>Examining the end is what the world gives,</p>
<p>Scholars value insight,</p>
<p>Future generations are like day rats,</p>
<p>Gentlemen nurture the great spirit,</p>

<h3 id="e260">Zai Yu's Daytime Nap - A New Interpretation of the Analects <a href="#e260" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c260" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">260</a></h3>
<p>— Cheng Luding</p>
<p>I dare not say how depraved Zai Yu was, I do not want to say how diligent he was, but I do not acknowledge Confucius' words as great truths. At the very least, Zai Yu had his own standards, didn't he? He was quite the modern college student.</p>
<p>Otherwise, why would he take a daytime nap? Although taking a daytime nap is not a sin, the daytime is a happy time, suitable for crawling like a dog in the girls' dormitory, or blowing things up in a classmate's room. Why sleep? What's so good about sleeping? He did not even breathe a little, so what was it for?</p>
<p>Was it to save the country, awaiting the dawn with weapons at the ready? Was it to resist the enemy, making night into day? I don't think so. Even if that was the case, at least it had nothing to do with studying.</p>
<p>Secondly, there's the dance hall, the amusement park, or some comfortable den, or perhaps a grand hotel.</p>
<p>In reality, rather than saying he was taking a daytime nap to save the country and resist the enemy, it would be more accurate to say he was taking a daytime nap while "saving the country without forgetting entertainment and resisting the enemy without forgetting entertainment." That would be more accurate and appropriate.</p>
<p>It can be seen that daytime napping has been "a constant since ancient times" in the history of college students, and of course, it is "even more rampant today." No wonder today's general college students are in love today and consorting with prostitutes tomorrow. It turns out that there is a basis for this talk.</p>

<p>Rubber raw material rubber trees are produced in large quantities in Southeast Asia; however, the rubber hooks are produced in the eyes of every fashionable young woman. What strange news this is!</p>

<p>"Food and sex are the great desires of man." Even a sage like Confucius said this. No wonder the general youth who call themselves new people run on the wrong path of pursuing the opposite sex every day without fear of stumbling.</p>
<p>×× ×× ××</p>
<p>Traditional accounts tell us this: the place where women convey affection is in their water-cutting pupils. Indeed, this is undeniable. If women wear a pair of red glasses, even if the rest of them are intact and beautiful, all the beauty will be taken away by those glasses. Therefore, the first requirement of women is still in their flexible and moving eyes.</p>
<p>×× ××</p>
<p>Men are made of mud, so of course they will melt when they see women made of water. This is another kind of proof. If they often have opportunities to meet in a certain place, the rubber hook in her eyes will hook you completely in the invisible.</p>
<p>×× ×× ××</p>
<p>If you are hooked: your nerves will vibrate: there will be an image of a beauty in your mind; you will find work boring; you will feel that your family is outdated······and everything else. At the same time, you will be eager to: find more money for her to spend; steal some time to have fun with her. 丨丨Like this, from shallow to deep, from light to strong; you will finally enter the door of trouble and be unable to extricate yourself!</p>

<p>(1) A friend traveled to Little Luzon during Christmas, a trip of more than ten days, costing more than a thousand gold. He returned a few days ago, looking haggard, as if he had recovered from a serious illness. Asked if he enjoyed the trip? He blushed and said: "Unfortunately, I had seasickness and lay down for days. There was no pleasure to speak of. Not only did I not see the soft hands of Luzon girls holding cigars, but I did not even catch a glimpse of the lights of Kowloon." This can be called a "humorous traveler."</p>

<p>— Lean Cuckoo</p>
<p>In this illusory film, some scenes are very clear, and some scenes seem to be somewhat blurred. However, no matter how old or small the matter is, not a single point is missed. This is what he experienced five years ago, and it can also be said to be a nightmare five years ago.</p>
<p>The first scene playing in his brain is a gloomy and terrible snowy night. That night the air was colder than iron; sharper than a knife, it forced the stars and moon to hide timidly. Goose palm-sized snowflakes, encouraged by the northwest wind, formed a large team, jumping disorderly in the air. The dead branches and leaves of the trees struggled hard in the cruel wind, issuing a series of mournful groans. In nature, there was a piece of darkness, occasionally borrowing the reflective light of the snow to show a tree and a house in the distance, all showing a hideous state, like many wild beasts squatting on the side of the road, baring their teeth and claws, ready to grab people and devour them.</p>
<p>At that time: he endured the cold; braved the snow; faced the wind like sharp arrows, panting; shaking; and with panic, he ran on a desolate and vast wilderness. He ran for more than ten miles in one breath, and still did not see a single person. Several times, he was almost knocked unconscious by the huge wind. The snowflakes all over his body, if turned into rice flour, would not only cure his current hunger, but would also be enough to store as food for a few days. His clothes and body were almost frozen into three whole pieces. But the colder his body was, the more anxious he felt, and the more he felt that this vast wilderness was exceptionally far away compared to when he had passed it in the past. When he slightly stopped to catch his breath, he only heard one or two dog barks in the distance, mixed in the howling wind, faintly floating to his ears. This kind of dog bark seemed unable to withstand this extreme cold, so it was extraordinarily sharp and urgent, equivalent to the last miserable cry of a patient dying. After hearing it, it almost immediately froze all the blood in his body.</p>
<p>It turned out that this time, because he was not tolerated by his dark family and his cruel stepmother, he gritted his teeth and would rather rush into the dark wilderness; cruel wind and snow, risking his life to go to his close friend Dongfangsheng.</p>
<p>When Ouyang Wu recalled the events of five years ago to this point, he suddenly felt a wisp of cold air冒出来直冒出来的，笼罩满了全身，彷佛又置身于当年的冰天雪阵中。</p>

<h3 id="e265">Why Do We Shiver When It's Cold? <a href="#e265" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c265" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">265</a></h3>
<p>— Bing Yu</p>
<p>Little brother, little sister, our bodies cannot be too cold, nor can they be too hot. If it is too cold, we will feel like shivering. Because in our brains, there are very sensitive nerves that pay attention to hot and cold. When the temperature of the body suddenly drops due to the influence of outside cold air, the nerves immediately send out an order to contract to the muscles in all directions. As soon as the muscles contract, they show a shivering appearance, so shivering is due to muscle contraction.</p>
<p>On cold days, if we exercise our whole body's muscles, we can generate heat. For example, if we stand still in a windy and snowy place, we will definitely get colder and colder. If we move our body and limbs up, down, left, and right for a few minutes, then the muscles in all directions will gradually tense, and the whole body will feel warm.</p>

<p>Li Puman was a very poor young man. One day, he went out to travel and forgot to bring a rubber eraser, but he needed to write a travel diary. When he wrote his diary with a pencil on the way, he often made mistakes, but he didn't have a rubber eraser to erase them, and he felt very inconvenient. He thought quietly, if the pencil and rubber eraser were combined into one piece, it would naturally avoid this trouble. After returning home, he invented the method of attaching a rubber eraser to the end of a pencil. The "rubber-tipped pencils" that we use now are what this young man came up with.</p>
<p>There was also a Walter Hand, who went up the mountain wearing a cloak. Halfway there, the button of the cloak suddenly fell off. However, the wind was very strong on the road. As he walked, he thought, and came up with a method to replace the button. He took out a piece of iron wire, bent it into a curved shape, and made a safety pin. Later, he used this as motivation to invent the safety pin.</p>

<h3 id="e270">Selling Children <a href="#e270" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c270" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">270</a></h3>
<p>— Fang San</p>
<p>"Who wants a child, selling a child!" A sad and high-pitched voice came from the alley into my room.</p>
<p>This is probably the saddest voice in the world! It is also the most indignant voice in the world!</p>
<p>Then, with one voice after another, high and low: "Who wants a child, selling a child!" Like a wounded beast wailing in the cold wind.</p>
<p>I opened the window and looked: a woman was sitting on the cement floor, wrapping a child in torn clothes. His mother seemed to be afraid that he would catch a cold, and also afraid that he would be snatched away, tightly holding him in her arms.</p>
<p>Next to the woman stood a man in his thirties, probably her husband, the child's father; the person who was shouting "Who wants a child, selling a child!" He lowered his head, his face full of sorrow and shame.</p>
<p>Five or six women were surrounding them, discussing the pros and cons. "This is not a good seed!" The Northern accent came from the mouth of a woman with permed hair wearing a cheongsam. Another woman, about forty years old, wearing Chinese clothing, but with smooth hair, combed into a cow-like bun. She said to the person selling the child:</p>
<p>"Can you write?" Hearing this, I thought she had a "good" heart and wanted to introduce him to a job. But then, she said: "You write a word, and I'll give you three or four dollars and sell me that child."</p>
<p>The man selling the child replied affirmatively:</p>
<p>"I can't. You can take him if you want, just give me a few dollars."</p>
<p>"It doesn't matter if you can't write, just draw a cross." She said again.</p>
<p>The man was hesitating, the woman holding the child was crying, and grief was gnawing at the hearts of a poor couple.</p>
<p>"It doesn't matter much whether you can write or not. Take a few dollars, and take the child away." After a long time, the man finally replied like this:</p>
<p>A woman pulled the woman who wanted to buy the child and whispered a few words in her ear. And showed a smug look: "It's not successful if you don't write."</p>
<p>The woman who wanted to buy the child said: "As long as you draw a cross, I can give you a few more dollars. You know, I still need to hire a nanny for him when I buy the child, and make clothes for him······" She showed a proud look.</p>
<p>Hearing these words, the woman holding the child cried even more sadly. Her head lowered to the child's head, her face lining the child's face. Intermittently said:</p>
<p>"Oh my god! Little precious, you······you; are you really going to be sold by me? I thought we could have food to eat when we came to Shanghai from the countryside, but who knew that after all the hardships of coming to Shanghai, we are still hungry···hungry···hungry. Your dad is going to sell you to eat! God, aren't we poor people even allowed to have children? Selling···selling···selling children·····" The sound behind was truncated in grief and anger.</p>
<p>His man raised his head, his face even paler and terrible; but what spewed out of his eyes was clearly the fire of anger. He said loudly:</p>
<p>"Are we still going to starve to death? Heaven, we are so poor that we are selling children, and we are not even allowed to have a child! But, we have to find a way to live! Poor people have to find a way to live!"</p>
<p>The women who were watching the excitement, seeing this crazy situation, all cast contemptuous eyes, and left like a swarm of bees, laughing and jumping. The woman who wanted to buy the child also put her hands in her pockets, gave a cold laugh, and leisurely went home.</p>
<p>The knife-like cold wind was still roaring in the air, blowing over the road, blowing over the wilderness, but it could not blow into the tall foreign houses. The parents who sold the child dragged their child, staggering and calling out on the road and in the wilderness. I seemed to hear him calling until dawn.</p>
<h3 id="e271">Let's Have the Facts <a href="#e271" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c271" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">271</a></h3>
<p>— Yang Xingzhi</p>
<p>Until now, our General Zhang Xueliang has finally gritted his teeth and said a "hard" word, "The Japanese atrocities can only be fought with flesh and blood, and justice can only be maintained with hot blood." (See the newspaper of January 9th) Although this is only a "word," it is "much better" than the attitude of always being "calm" and playing golf and listening to Peking Opera when there is nothing to do.</p>
<p>However, it has been a year and four months since the 9/18 incident broke out. We are used to hearing vows of "long-term resistance," and we are also used to hearing declarations of "preparedness," "planning," and "determination," and we are even more used to reading proclamations such as "the government will never fail the people·········" We have been deceived and fooled by such "vows" and "proclamations" for a year and four months. Now what we need are facts, standing up and working hard, and "really" taking blood and flesh to resist the actual actions of the Japanese atrocities. We no longer need smokescreens to deceive people, and we no longer need checks that are not cashed.</p>
<p>From retreating from Shenyang to Jinzhou, and then from Jinzhou to Shanhaiguan, now, the blood-red sun flag is flying on Shanhaiguan! Even if you can still retreat, but you retreat one step and he advances one step. The facts of the past year are as clear as iron. When you retreat, where exactly is your "last" "retreat"?</p>
<p>"Seeking self-defense and self-rescue through our own efforts" and "resisting the aggressive atrocities of Japanese imperialists" are "heavenly principles." As long as you are willing to "resist" and you are willing to "defend," the people will never let you fight alone. Ma Zhanshan, Cai Tingkai, Su Bingwen and other troops are examples before us.</p>
<p>If you neither fight nor defend, and when the enemy comes, you retreat desperately, and you send off the territory piece by piece in such a perfunctory manner, and let the sun flag be planted on Shenyang City, planted on Changbai Mountain, and now planted on Shanhaiguan, or even further·········"Who is harming the country?" The people will eventually rise up and settle accounts!</p>
<p>Therefore, General Zhang does not need to say "blood and flesh" empty-mouthed, just take the facts, just really take the blood and flesh to fight in front of Shanhaiguan!</p>

<p>During the reign of Emperor Guangxu, Anhui Hefei, due to Li Hongzhang's training of the Huai Army, following the Xiang Army of Zeng Wenzheng, conquered Hong Yang and pacified the various anti-Qing civilian armies in Henan and Anhui, so the famous generals of the Huai Army, such as Pan Dingzhen, Zhou Shengbo, and Liu Mingchuan, all became high officials. Most of these people were from the vicinity of Hefei. At that time, Hefei had a high reputation and commanded the Northern Ocean Army and Navy. At the time of the Boxer Rebellion, the Eight-Nation Alliance attacked Shandong and Zhili. The garrison commander of Weihaiwei was Dai Mingqian, with the courtesy name Xiaohou, from Shouzhou, and a student of Hefei. Dai commanded dozens of camps of the entire water and land army, and also led the various forts of Weihaiwei. At that time, the Beiyang Army had become the end of its strength, and Dai's personality was diligent in serving his superiors and cowardly in resisting insults. One day, Dai was gambling with his subordinates and lost a lot. A fort officer hurriedly came forward to report that there were several warships in the distance on the sea, and they were driving close to the fort. When viewed with a telescope, they seemed to be British warships. He asked for instructions on what to do. Dai was furious and scolded him, "You bastard; get out! Don't you know I've lost?" The fort officer had no choice but to return dejectedly. Before long, someone came in a panic again and urged him urgently, "Report to the Commander: The warships are about to reach the firing line, what exactly······" Dai scolded him angrily again, "Are you really blind? Just now I was losing, and you came to disturb me; now I'm just about to win, and you're bothering me again, are we enemies? Give me······" Suddenly, he heard, bang, bang, bang, and the enemy had already bombarded the fort. Dai pushed the cards away and fled without a fight. When the main general fled, the soldiers lost their fighting spirit, and the British warships easily occupied Weihaiwei. Afterwards, Dai reported that he had hanged himself, probably to deceive the Qing court to escape death. The complacency and martial arts of the Qing court resulted in losing the army and losing land in this way. How different is today from the past? Thinking about it, I am filled with emotion!</p>

<p>(1) Miers Watching Save a Life</p>
<p>The Scottish poet Miers (Robert Burns, 1759-1796) one day walked to the wharf in Greenock and happened to see a wealthy merchant fall into the river and be rescued.</p>
<p>After the merchant regained consciousness, he thanked the sailor who saved his life and solemnly gave him a shilling. The surrounding crowd unanimously condemned his stinginess, but Burns stopped them, saying:</p>
<p>"Let him be. This gentleman is naturally the best judge of the value of his own life."</p>
<p>(2) Button</p>
<p>The great German philosopher Kant (1724-1804) was an eccentric. When he lectured on the platform, his eyes were always fixed on a student whose coat was missing a button. This had become a habit. One day, the student's button was sewn back on, and the philosopher seemed to have lost his soul, and that day's lecture almost could not finish.</p>
<p>(3) Ireland's Tax-Free Air</p>
<p>One day, Lady Carteret, the wife of the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, boasted to the Irish writer Swift (1667-1745) about the glory of Ireland. "The air of Ireland," she said, "is very beautiful and healthy."</p>
<p>"For God's sake, Madam," Swift knelt down to the noble lady and said, "don't say this in England, because if you say so, they will definitely impose a tax on the air again."</p>
<p>(4) The German Emperor's Design of a Warship</p>
<p>The German Emperor (Kaiser) liked to design his own palaces, castles, churches, and warships. In the 1910s, when he visited Italy, he became acquainted with Italian Navy Minister Admiral Bailing. Admiral Bailing was then regarded in Europe as one of the most talented shipbuilding experts. The German Emperor told Admiral Bailing that he could send him a drawing of a battleship, which he had planned with painstaking effort, a harvest of long-term research, tireless diligence, and contemplation.</p>
<p>A few weeks later, Bailing received the drawing sent by the German Emperor. After reading it, he returned it to the German Emperor along with the following letter:</p>
<p>"The warship designed by Your Majesty is truly the most capable, most terrifying, and most lovable battleship ever seen in the world. Its speed will definitely create an unprecedented record. Its armor can surpass all warships sailing on the water today. Its masts will become the tallest in the world, and its cannons will defeat any warship in the world. Moreover, the internal equipment is so perfectly arranged that all the crew, from the captain to the cabin boy, will enjoy being able to drive on this ship. This amazing warship has only one shortcoming: if it is put on the water, it will sink like a lump of lead."</p>

<p>The Oriental patrolman's leather shoe suddenly flew onto his shoulder again. The rickshaw puller did not expect the Oriental patrolman's foot to be so fierce and fell down. The Oriental patrolman kicked him in the waist two or three times before taking off the white cotton cloth cushion from his rickshaw, holding it in his hand with great satisfaction, and striding northward.</p>
<p>"Is it easy to do business with the Japanese? I guarantee you'll lose money!"</p>
<p>"Pulling a Japanese devil and not getting paid, consider yourself unlucky. Why run to the patrolman? How can the Japanese not help the Japanese?"</p>
<p>"Down with Japanese imperialism!"</p>
<p>This strange cry caught Haiquan's attention. He hurriedly turned his head to look at the person who said "Down with Japanese imperialism." It was a young man wearing a purple duckbill cap with a colored badge in the center, only about fifteen or sixteen years old. Haiquan could not help but feel a little respect for this young man. At the same time, he felt ashamed for his own spiritual decline.</p>
<p>"Those Japanese are Mrs. Tsuruko's compatriots!"</p>
<p>He thought, lifted his legs, and walked south. He seemed to hear the Japanese in that Japanese store laughing at him,</p>
<p>"Chinese! Baka!"</p>
<p>(17)</p>
<p>Mrs. Tsuruko, accompanied by two Japanese, 丨丨 an old man and a young girl, 丨丨 drove home in a car. It was already drizzling outside.</p>
<p>"Is Mr. Lin back?"</p>
<p>As soon as she met the nanny, she asked anxiously.</p>
<p>"He went to bed early."</p>
<p>"Went to bed? ······"</p>
<p>She looked at the watch on her wrist, frowned slightly, and asked unconsciously.</p>
<p>"Ah, it's almost twelve o'clock."</p>
<p>She seemed to be saying to the two Japanese. At this time, she seemed to have no time to pay attention to these two Japanese guests, and suddenly walked up to the third floor alone. She was thinking,</p>
<p>"He's such a child, it's really impossible to deal with him. These past few days, he's been so angry, leaving early and returning late, and he doesn't even come home for dinner. This morning, I wanted to say a few words to him, so I got up early on purpose. But no matter how much I ask him, he doesn't answer. This is really distressing!"</p>
<p>Although she felt that Haiquan's temper was strange, she liked it in another sense, because she had already confirmed that his heart for her was twelve points sincere.</p>
<p>She stood at the door of Haiquan's room, wanting to push the door in. But she hesitated again. The door of Haiquan's room was never locked from the inside. She knocked lightly on the door, but there was no response from inside. She couldn't help but reach out and push the door, and the door opened with a sound. The light in Haiquan's room was not turned off, but Haiquan was indeed asleep. His quilt was deeply covering his chin.</p>

<h3 id="e275">Where Are the Farmers Going? <a href="#e275" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c275" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">275</a></h3>
<p>— Tian Fang</p>
<p>丨丨A Serious Rural Problem丨丨</p>
<p>Last winter, there was a great harvest in the country, with a yield of more than 120%. However, due to last year's floods and the invasion of foreign rice and wheat, as well as the manipulation of the market by merchants, rice prices plummeted. In Zhaozhu's hometown, 丨丨 the Jiaxing area of western Zhejiang, the recent rice price is only about five yuan per stone. According to the best harvest, calculated at three stones per mu, it can only be sold for fifteen or sixteen yuan. After deducting one-third for rent, the remainder is not enough to repay labor and fertilizer, let alone have surplus money to provide for wives and children to add clothing. Although rice prices are low, what other property do farmers 丨丨 especially Chinese farmers, have besides grain? Therefore, most farmers who urgently need money have to endure the pain of selling the grain they have worked for all year long. When they can no longer survive in the countryside, they come to the city to become industrial candidates. In this way, the rural economy is further declining, and the lower foundation of society is gradually showing signs of shaking. This collapse is becoming more and more obvious over the years.</p>
<p>The slogan "Establish the country on agriculture" has been sung in China for four or five thousand years, but in recent years, this old tune can no longer be sung. This is because agricultural countries import an average of 100 million yuan of foreign food. Isn't this a joke? Therefore, the old signboard of "Establishing the country on agriculture" has to be removed now. But the old signboard has already been removed, and the new signboard has not yet been hung up. If someone asks us what the basis of "establishing the country" is now, then we can only say that we are "establishing the country by relying on heaven." Because the old self-sufficient rural economy has been completely destroyed, and the new industry and commerce 丨丨 national capital is oppressed by foreign capital, making it difficult to rise. Now, in China's economic organization, the countryside has become the tail of urban industry and commerce, and urban industry and commerce have become the tail of foreign capitalism. The mode of production is not complete in our current tail. We are only gasping for breath in the cracks, and cannot find a way out. But this serious problem cannot be ignored. According to a survey by the Wuhan Central Land Committee in 1927, there are 336 million farmers in China, accounting for 84% of the total population. Most of these huge numbers of farmers have lost their livelihoods and cannot run to the city 丨丨 the city is also suffering the same fate. But survival is the first desire of mankind, and we cannot all starve to death. The two ways out for these farmers are to become "bandits" or "soldiers."</p>
<p>Becoming a bandit requires raising your own equipment, and the risk is great. The last way is mostly to become a soldier.</p>
<p>China is a country famous for its large number of soldiers, but in a society where "good men don't become soldiers," where do these more than two million strong men come from? The answer is that they are all surplus population forced out of the countryside.</p>
<p>Let's look at what happens after civil strife and war.</p>
<p>In theory, the responsibility of soldiers should be "defending the country" and "protecting the people." There should be no other definition, right? But in China, everything is an exception. Foreigners see Chinese armed comrades as tirelessly killing each other, which seems mysterious and too ridiculous. But this is the special characteristic of Chinese soldiers. Because they become soldiers due to extreme poverty, anyone who provides them with food and clothing is their benefactor. As for concepts such as "people" and "country," there is not even a shadow of them in the soldiers' minds. This is not surprising. Before becoming a soldier, life is extremely low. After becoming a soldier, life is extremely indulgent. This has created a special outlook on life, which is to believe in "omnipotent force." Wearing the skin of a tiger, who dares to say "no"?</p>

<p>Sharing a car to Yuhua Terrace, reverently sitting and deeply discussing the ashes of calamity. In difficult times, the mountains and rivers need your teachings. Facing the desolate forest, the trees seem to pity talent. Going back and forth, there are only tears for the rise and fall of dynasties. Decline and drowning all echo the sorrow of drums and horns. Leaning alone against the setting sun, I offer a cup of wine, and the Yang stele and ten thousand mounds stand together, majestic.</p>

<p>What is the sorrow amidst the shaking leaves of the forest? Only the vitality of bamboo, pine, and plum remains.

<h3 id="e278">How to Calculate Our Electricity Bill <a href="#e278" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c278" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">278</a></h3>
<p>— Xue Hai</p>
<p>Those who have been subtenants in Shanghai probably know the second landlord's wife's attention to the opening and closing of the tenant's lights, and the fuss about how much electricity is used, right? We often hear the second landlord's wife complaining that the tenant only pays one or two yuan for electricity, and a sixteen-candlepower lamp has to be lit until twelve o'clock every day, grumbling that the consumption of electricity is not enough for such a price. As for the tenants, they feel that the electricity bill they pay is more than enough; thus, a pointless dispute arises between the two parties. In fact, the second landlord definitely has no way to estimate how much electricity the tenant consumes each month; and the subtenant has no way to prove or explain how much electricity he consumes himself. Everyone speaks according to their own personal opinions, how can disputes be eliminated? Now I will write down some simple methods for calculating electricity bills, so that ordinary families can have a kind of preliminary calculation for the monthly electricity bill; and it can also avoid many disputes between landlords and tenants.</p>
<p>The size of the light we use now is calculated in "watts" or "candlepower." For example, if there is 40W on the light bulb, it is forty watts; or 32CP, it is thirty-two candlepower. Recently, light bulbs are mostly calculated in watts, and not in candlepower, because the watt unit is easier to calculate. For clarity, first copy a table below for comparison:</p>
<p>Wattage 7 5 14 5 18 25 25 40 60 100 150 250</p>
<p>Candlepower 5 10 16 18 8 31 34 88 88 70 1340 2270</p>
<p>We know that using one thousand watts of electricity per hour will move the electricity meter by one unit. Now we assume that a tenant uses a sixteen-candlepower lamp. We can find from the above table that a sixteen-candlepower lamp equals 18.25 watts. If the light is turned on at about six o'clock every day and turned off at twelve o'clock, averaging six hours, then the monthly electricity bill can be calculated according to the following formula:</p>
<p>30 × 6 × 18.25 / 1000 = 3285 / 1000 = 3.285 KWH</p>
<p>This 3.285 is the number of units on the electricity meter. Calculating each unit at twenty cents, the monthly bill is less than eighty cents! If we change to a forty-watt light bulb, we can also calculate according to the following formula:</p>
<p>30 × 6 × 40 / 1000 7200 / 1000 = 7.2 SWH</p>
<p>The calculation is seven units and some change, and the monthly electricity bill is only one yuan and forty-four cents.</p>
<p>With this calculation method, if more lights are lit, it can also be inferred accordingly. We should not be completely unsure about the electricity bill each month, right?</p>

<p>— Bin Fu</p>
<p>The New Year has passed, and the few days of legal holiday, which people have longed for for so long, have also sneaked away. Now, we have to shake up our spirits and retighten our relaxed nerves, and return to the writing desk, and return to the counter.</p>
<p>Rest seems to be very predestined for people. People who come to work after resting for a few days seem to still be thinking about the days of rest with "emotional ties." When they are bored in the office, or when they are dozing off at the counter, and think about the peaceful and leisurely scenes of the past few days, they can't help but hum "Where is it now?"</p>
<p>Where is it now: The "pure one-suit, three generations", the legs of the "dancing queen" and "Dr. Mei's" ······ ah!</p>
<p>× × × ×</p>
<p>Maybe someone will ask: In this "brand new" year, what exactly are we people in Shanghai doing to pass the time? Then I can immediately reply that, in addition to the "pure one-suit, three generations", most people are breeding "national disasters" and desperately doing "national salvation" work. For example, at the entrance of the Northeast Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army Entertainment Association and the theater where "Dr. Mei" performed a charity show to relieve Northeast refugees, it is not crowded with people, and it is not a stupid person who cannot be taught who would say that they are going to "appreciate eroticism" or "seek pleasure." It is said that there is no "entertainment" to be found in here. Connecting national salvation with entertainment is naturally like a horse's head not matching a cow's mouth. Everything in here will shock you and make you vigilant. The girls' tireless dancing will make you "feel distressed" and blush; Dr. Mei's tactful and tragic singing will make you "hot tears surge"; therefore, the people who are saddened by the country's difficulties are flocking to this place to "cry in unison" with everyone who has a heart, and the volunteer army and refugees in the frozen and snowy land will receive infinite gifts. "Rainbow Feather Dress" has been successful in saving the country and relieving disasters. This is a "new" fact in the "new" year of 1933!</p>
<p>× × × ×</p>
<p>We looked around from the New Year's observation deck and saw that the beacon fire in the north corner had risen again. Hearing the third air raid alarm, it rang again, shaking the sky and the earth!</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, the crisis of the nation and the country has become even more severe in this brand new year. We have to get up quickly to save the country, and we have to adopt "new methods" to save it. So, we shouted:</p>
<p>Sing loudly, let us cheer for our warriors!</p>
<p>Dance energetically, let us cheer for our athletes!</p>
<p>The Yuyang drums are energetically coming, and the rainbow feather dresses are energetically dancing!</p>

<p>— Wen Bing</p>
<p>This was told to me by a friend, Mr. So-and-so. The incident happened at ×× University.</p>
<p>Because the semester is coming to an end, we are still making up lessons at night. Since the professor still has the heart to make up, the students also seem to be embarrassed to not attend; so ×× University at night is just like daytime: Probably because they are too used to attending classes during the day, the students don't think of the night classes as boring. Since it is a make-up class, and it is at night, it is even more comfortable.</p>
<p>The professor is lecturing enthusiastically, but the students are like they are lying on the sofa. Some are tilting their heads and drawing on the notepad. They are all more or less the same quick sketches of people, such as sketching for Sun Yat-sen first, and then quickly sketching Madam Soong Qingling next to him; some feel that this kind of sketching is too ordinary, and it is better to spend some energy on sketching the trendy Misses in front of them, or to sketch a male classmate with a special appearance; some feel that whispering is better; some throw paper balls casually; Night is originally a time for rest, so there are fewer people secretly reading novels than during the day.</p>
<p>"Knock knock knock" The classroom door is ringing intermittently.</p>
<p>"Who?" The professor put down the textbook and stared at the classroom door, so the ringing stopped, but the classroom suddenly seemed uneasy.</p>
<p>"Knock knock knock" It is ringing again, the professor came down from the platform, opened the door, and found a short-shirted friend standing at the door.</p>
<p>"What are you doing?" The professor asked:</p>
<p>"Looking for Master Nian, Miss Yang's family asked me to pick him up in a car, I already came at half past four in the afternoon, it's almost nine o'clock now, I don't know if Master Nian is going dancing tonight ······"</p>
<p>"Tch"! The professor snorted, turned around and closed the door, and a roar of laughter suddenly broke out in the classroom. You look at me, and I look at you, among them, the face of student ×× is the most ugly, a burst of red, a burst of white, and his expression seems very uneasy.</p>
<p>It is said that the short-shirted friend is the chartered rickshaw driver of Miss Yang's family at ×× dance hall. This time, he really touched bad luck, because he always pulled Miss Yang's chartered rickshaw, always pulling the Miss from home to the dance hall, and then going to ×× Grand Hotel or ×× Hotel to pick up Mr. ×× or Master ××. That was a very convenient matter. Beforehand, the Miss had already notified by phone, or the hotel's waiter had already called. As soon as the rickshaw went, there would be a fat person pulling it back. He had never been to a university to pick up anyone, so he felt a little dazed pulling the rickshaw to the gate of ×× University.</p>
<p>However, dazed as he may be, how can the rickshaw return empty? So he went to the gatehouse. The gatekeeper said that Master Nian cannot be found, at least he must have a surname, so he said the surname, Wang. The gatekeeper said again that he must have a name, so he scratched his head and said with a crooked mouth? "I don't know his name!" The gatekeeper glanced at him and went to take care of other matters, so he felt even more dazed. However, his mission had not been accomplished. Although he was dazed, he still had to think of another way. How can the rickshaw return empty?</p>
<p>It was already past eight o'clock, not only was his own stomach a little hungry, but he didn't know how anxious the Miss was at the dance hall. So he thought of going to the office to inquire, but he also felt that he was not very sure, but for the sake of the rickshaw not returning empty, he had to go. He had just stepped onto the stone steps of the office when he happened to meet the ×× janitor who seemed familiar and said: "It's a bit inconvenient to go to the office, isn't it? Are you looking for that tall Master Nian with the surname Wang: He is attending classes there. Come, I will lead you to" 丨 car, my heart suddenly relaxed a lot, and I felt that the responsibility was somewhat settled. The Miss's "pig" The scolding or punishment can be avoided.</p>
<p>It's just that Master Nian is a bit inconsiderate. Even if he doesn't worry about the rickshaw driver standing outside the classroom door, he should also think about Miss Yang's eager anticipation at the dance hall.</p>
<p>A burst of red, a burst of white on his face, many classmates' eyes were fixed on student ××, making him feel a little hesitant? "Should I leave early from class, or should I go after class?"</p>
<h3 id="e282">A Review of Twenty-One Years 丨A Balance Sheet丨 <a href="#e282" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c282" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">282</a></h3>
<p>— A Jie</p>
<p>The god of the times, with his wings fluttering, is constantly flying forward; these twenty-one years are about to end. Let us carefully review this year, diplomacy, internal affairs, military affairs, education, national disasters, bandits, people's livelihood,··· and make a balance sheet. It is exactly as the saying goes, "Where to start with a twenty-four history!" Alas, looking back on the past and looking forward to the future, who does not feel endless emotion!</p>
<p>The map of the three northeastern provinces has changed color. Where have the more than 3.5 million square li of fertile land gone? Have the more than 24 million compatriots become slaves of a conquered nation? Forests, coal, iron, beans, wheat, gold mines, railways, customs duties... Whose property have they become? Although there are hundreds of thousands of righteous soldiers, severing their necks and bleeding, fighting desperately with the brutal sun with their sincere hearts and hot blood, I don't know how many have died this year! Exchanging heads for fierce planes and artillery shells, how much achievement can be made! But in this year, everyone only knew how to hide behind and shout loudly, resist! resist! It was as if something was really happening. As for the lords and gentlemen, Jesus has his own reasons, making people feel unfathomable. Moreover, the brutal sun's ambition to gain Long and look at Shu, and the wild ambition of a sealed pig and a long snake is really terrible. At present, the sound of cannons in Rehe is making a loud noise. I am afraid that in the hearing of our compatriots, it is still regarded as the lingering sound of the La drum!</p>
<p>Although we cannot pay the bill for resisting insults, the bill for fighting among ourselves is clear and clear. There is simply no "confused account"! Nephews fighting uncles has paid several bills for the misfortune of the common people; this expulsion of that one has paid several bills for moving scenes; new officials taking office, old officials being asked to leave, on this revolving lantern, several bills for promotion and wealth have been paid; bandits killing and arson, the old people in the countryside, with no way out, have paid several bills for escaping for their lives. People's livelihood is declining, customs are deteriorating day by day, suicide, adultery, robbery,······ Strange and strange, a complete mess, years of famine and chaotic times, I simply cannot report the balance sheet for these twenty-one years!</p>
<h3 id="e283">"Saving the Nation" Is Just Like This! A Letter Answering a Certain Lady <a href="#e283" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c283" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">283</a></h3>
<p>— A Group</p>
<p>Thank you for seeing Mei Lanfang's *Farewell My Concubine* and the Nanjing Grand Theater's *Savage Paradise*, and for also deigning to turn to this attached supplement; and for spending so much of your precious time to finish reading my "fart" of a text. I don't know what to say!</p>
<p>When your letter arrived, I had just returned from the office: that is, I had exchanged sweat and blood for a day's worth of three meals and tea. Dragging my tired body and mind, I prepared to rest in my small garret, but the news of the Japanese invaders attacking Peiping and Tianjin, once imprinted on my mind, never faded away. Originally, having spent two or three dollars to watch Beijing opera, dancing, variety shows... and mingling among the dancers, becoming indistinguishable in value from "you," I would shamelessly say that I had "fulfilled my duty to save the nation"! What is "saving the nation" all about? Forgive my youth and ignorance, and lacking the eloquent talent of "your" Mr. Li, who can make "saving the nation" sound like a flowery fantasy, "charging on the lips." Because you wanted to know about my situation after we parted, I wrote a rambling account. Who knew that I would offend Mrs. Li, a "wayward child" who knows she deserves to die ten thousand times, so after reading your letter, I stood up and remained silent for three minutes.</p>
<p>"However, in these chaotic times, even if national subjugation is imminent, it can be put aside; I still have to struggle every day for my three meals of plain tea and simple food..." Of course, my conscience reproaches me that I shouldn't say such things, but I don't have strong fists, nor do I have a strong body. Fortunately, I still have an iron will. "Saving the nation" is everyone's business. Volunteer soldiers fighting the Japanese in bloody battles is saving the nation, the government's telegram for long-term resistance is also saving the nation, and even drinking tea, drinking wine, dancing... are all "saving the nation." I do my work, I eat my food, I don't become a traitor, I don't do anything that would let down the nation, society, or myself, so I can probably say I am passively "saving the nation."</p>
<p>Finally, you say that the residents of Shanghai have forgotten that the three million square li of Manchuria, seized by the invaders, are outside the pass. To donate a copper coin, they give it like alms to a beggar. That's why this recreational event for national salvation is being held. There's dancing, there's entertainment to watch, spending a few dollars doesn't matter. You, embracing the responsibility of "saving the nation," sacrifice your beauty and volunteer to participate. Forgive my rudeness for offending such a patriotic woman, no, madam. "Saving the nation" is just like this. Thank you for helping me break open this sealed jar. As the saying goes, hearing one sentence from you is better than reading ten years of books!</p>
<p>However, I must declare that the space in this publication is as precious as your dancing time. Whether you will see this letter when you turn to Mei Lanfang is still a question, so I solemnly declare that future letters will not be answered.</p>
<h3 id="e284">Life in a Dream <a href="#e284" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c284" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">284</a></h3>
<p>— Female Smoker</p>
<p>Busy with work all day, my body already feels extremely fatigued. The moment I lie down, I fall asleep with my head spinning. These days, I only wait for the arrival of sleep. Sleep is the supreme comforting realm for me. The pain I suffer during the day, whether given by society or self-inflicted; whether material or spiritual, can all be resolved in sleep. No, they can simply be transformed into vibrant red and white flowers.</p>
<p>Naturally, I have many sweet and grand dreams at night:</p>
<p>I myself don't quite understand how my originally weak body has become a heroic warrior, wearing a snow-white saber at my waist, holding a long bayonet rifle in my hand, stepping through the trenches of ice and snow, "Bang, bang, bang," shooting at the enemy. The enemies all fall down one by one in response, their fresh blood flowing into our trenches. I cup my hands and drink it wildly, singing patriotic songs in a loud voice.</p>
<p>Moreover, I also have a very beautiful lover with the same consciousness. She also carries a weapon and lies in the trench, shooting at the enemy. Her cheeks are flushed red, bathed in the blood of the enemy. Her legs are thick and strong, trained by running and killing the enemy. Sometimes I get impatient, and she comforts me not to be agitated. Sometimes I am timid, and she tells me to be calm. She says that after we recover the lost territory, we can have a fat child to remember it by.</p>
<p>Sure enough, the lost territory was recovered by us. Our nation was reborn. Manchuria is still our Manchuria. The suffering of the people is relieved, and my own pain has also disappeared. Everyone sings songs of victory.</p>
<p>"Woof, woof, woof!" The dog's bark echoes through the front of the window and the door. I wake up from my dream with a start, and touch my forehead. It's a handful of cold sweat. I am very angry at why I am still lying on this cold wooden bed, a useless corpse.</p>
<p>The dog keeps barking. There are hurried footsteps outside the window. The person next door is opening the door to relieve himself. "Ah, there's a thief, catch him quickly!" So the dog barks even more anxiously, but the footsteps fade away. I also become wary. But what does this have to do with me? Besides a few broken books on the bookshelf, what else is there to attract a thief? I think, how can thieves not be afraid of the cold? Fumbling around in the dark, they are just trying to prolong their lives. Their stomachs are hungry, what can they do?</p>
<p>The dog has stopped barking, but it makes me unable to sleep anymore. In the silence, I faintly hear the snoring of the fat boss of the silk shop next door. I think he may be having even grander dreams:</p>
<p>Trading what one has for what one doesn't have, who says Japanese goods can't be bought? Originally, doing business is to earn more money. There are car tycoons and oil tycoons ahead of us... setting an example for us. Who will come to investigate me? I don't care! Or I'll bribe some money to those poor kids, and that's it! If not, I'll simply change the labels and sell them. Anyway, all of our great citizens are greedy for bargains. You're good, I'm good, everyone gets rich together. If Manchuria is lost, what does it matter? The world is basically one family now. When I have hundreds of thousands of fortunes, donating a little is no problem. This is not the time!</p>
<p>The more I think, the more awake I become. The fat boss is as if shaking on the ceiling.</p>
<p>I get out of bed to smoke a cigarette, only to remember that I forgot to take in the leather shoes I put out to dry outside the door this morning. The dog's barking seems to be ringing in my ears again. I'm too lazy to open the door and look for them. Whether they're there or not is hard to say.</p>
<p>The cigarette doesn't induce sleep either, but makes my head even dizzier.</p>
<p>"Tick, tock, tick, tock," the pendulum of the clock, suddenly "Dong, dong" rings five times. I open my eyes and look out the window. The sky is already the color of fish belly. So I put on my clothes, jump out of bed, and continue to busy myself with my work.</p>

<h3 id="e285">To Transform the Environment, One Must First Have Organization <a href="#e285" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c285" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">285</a></h3>
<p>— The Editor</p>
<p>Among the many letters received from readers, the majority express the need for collective unity. Therefore, many letters regarding the organization of groups have already been published in this column. However, organizing a group is not an easy task, and especially organizing a perfect group.</p>
<p>Currently, as far as we know, there are already three groups that have the beginnings of a group and are already starting; this is only based on the perspective of shop employees, workers, apprentices, and those related to them. They all have great perseverance and an indomitable spirit; although it is not yet possible to say whether they will succeed in the future, we must at least know that the success of an organization is based on the spirit of the organizers and the core members.</p>
<p>For an organization with a pure purpose, although we cannot be in a leading position to work hard to preside over it, the responsibility of assisting from the side is our inescapable duty. Therefore, we hold a sincere hope that they will succeed soon, make contributions to society, and benefit the people. At the same time, we also express our admiration for the shop employees, workers, and apprentices who have far-sightedness, feel an urgent need, and therefore automatically rise up to organize, and are able to overcome all difficulties and gradually move towards the path of success!</p>
<p>Before introducing these three groups to the readers, we would like to offer a little advice to express our encouragement and mutual encouragement; "Failure is the mother of success" is a famous saying that you all know. If you encounter obstacles or suffer blows in the future! You must not be discouraged. At that time, you must remember this famous saying, continue to work hard and strive; you must know that the greater the blows you receive, the more solid the foundation will be in the future. The following is an overview of the three groups.</p>
<p>(1) Youth Work-Study Society In their declaration, they say; "... After the ceasefire agreement was concluded, all industries were depressed, and the people were struggling to make a living; we know even more deeply that unless we fundamentally and practically handle labor education to increase the wisdom of the people and promote the spirit of the people, our Chinese nation will not be able to plan for internal stability and resist foreign aggression and survive in the world. ... Everything that is most practical and beneficial to society is generally the most difficult to succeed; if we know the difficulties and plan for them in advance, then it will be easy to proceed. ... Moreover, now that we know the difficulties and move forward, we will never retreat when we see difficulties in the future. ..." From this, we can see that they have "the heart to succeed" and are "thinking before acting." They implement "labor education" with precise plans. Their purpose is "to promote the combination of manual and mental work"! Gradually achieving "no manual laborers who do not study, and no idlers who do not work." Moreover, they already have a considerable financial base, with Penglai Market as the area of implementation, and then gradually expand it. The founders, Kuang Zhongmou, Zhou Zhaoji, and others, are very enthusiastic. The location is at the Alumni Association of the Chinese Vocational School in Xiaoximen.</p>
<p>(2) Amateur Academic Research Society This organization is slightly different from the first organization. The first organization is the cooperation between labor and management to seek reform of the social system, so the plan is relatively grand. This organization is entirely because shop employees and others feel panicked about their own knowledge and use their spare time to make active remedies, so its scope is limited to "academic research" and mutual assistance in spirit. The process is also simpler. They wrote in their letter; "... Although it has not yet been formally established, there are already a considerable number of people, and the preparatory meeting has been held three or four times, and the charter has also been drafted. We are now recruiting members extensively, as long as they are formal shop employees, workers, and apprentices, they can join. ..." They also said; "... The liberation of shop employees themselves must have sufficient knowledge, and we can only do it by pooling our efforts ... We changed the name from "Weekly Academic Discussion Society" to "Amateur Academic Research Society" because it was too narrow. ..." The initiators are Zhang Siwei and others, and the address for correspondence is Zhang Siwei c/o Hezhong Enterprise Company, P.O. Box 2049, this port.</p>
<p>(3) Workers' Autonomy Advancement Society This organization and the second organization are on the same position and have the same meaning, but the scope is more extensive. Their letter said; "... Since I am not a person of great wisdom, I might as well use my stupid brain to do some stupid work. At the same time, I also feel that my strength is small, but there must be many such small forces in society ... I am determined to start from today, do it down-to-earth, gather these many small forces, and organize them into a group. The name of this group is "Workers' Autonomy Advancement Society" ..." We greatly admire this firm spirit. They have also predetermined plans for industrial manufacturing, academic research, cooperative undertakings, proper entertainment, travel, etc. The founder is Liu Xinmin, and the location is 164 Xinkaihe, Min'guo Road.</p>
<p>We know that to transform the bad system of society, we must first have organization, and we need a strong organization, so that we can achieve the goal of a good environment. The above three organizations are the beginning of the transformation of the environment. We hope that everyone will continue to work hard and complete this major mission as soon as possible.</p>

<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Wang the Second, the rent rice account from last year hasn't been settled until this time of year, that should be good enough for you, right? You still owe four dan and five dou of rice. No one needs to mention the five dou, I'll let that go. As for the four dan, do you want to pay in cash? Or do you want to give me rice?" Wang the Second loaded a dry tobacco pipe, leaned against the windbreak wall by the steps, and said slowly in a very dejected manner, "I beg the landlord elder to have mercy. With last year's harvest, that area couldn't possibly yield a full rent." The landlord said, "According to you, should I just let go of these four dan of rice?" As he spoke, he flipped through the account book again, as if examining it, and shook his head, "No way! None of my tenants have ever been let off this much." So these people who had eaten the landlord's food had an obligation to mediate and all came to persuade. After everyone discussed, Meng Guobao interjected, "My father is also a landlord, I won't be biased towards either side, I'll speak fairly. When the new rice came on the market last year in August and September, it only sold for three or four dollars a dan. When the landlord came to collect the rice, the tenants had rice. After April this year, rice sold for five or six dollars a dan, and the tenants' rice at home had already been sold. At this time, if you want to collect rice, the tenants naturally don't have it. If you want to convert it to cash, compared to last fall, the tenant has to lose more than two dollars per dan of rice. How can farmers bear that?" The landlord's face turned red and he said, "According to Mr. Meng, it sounds like the landlord deliberately waited until this day to settle the accounts. But I don't know that I urged him to settle up last fall, but he never settled it. What can I do? If it's not settled, the new rice will come out again." Wang the Second said, "It's not that I didn't settle it, but I already lost money on the rent rice I gave last year. Where am I going to get it for the landlord?" Meng Guobao said, "Old Second, you're also at fault. Last fall, after you gave all the rice, you should have stated that you couldn't give any more rice. But it's not enough to just state it to the landlord, because even if you say you stated it to the landlord, the landlord might say you didn't state it, so it's still not clear. You should report this to the district office. The gentlemen in the district office now are all young students, they will definitely speak fairly." As he said this, every sentence was telling Wang the Second, but his voice was very loud, clearly telling the landlord.</p>

<h3 id="e287">The Barrymore Family's Collaborative Masterpiece <a href="#e287" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c287" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">287</a></h3>
<p>— Brilliant</p>
<p>The Barrymores are known to everyone as the only family in the American art world worthy of admiration. In Hollywood, there is no other family more glorious or revered than them. Although I only know three big stars from their family on the screen now—Lionel, John, and Ethel—there must be countless members of their family serving in the film industry, and many of their ancestors were famous figures on the stage. Even now, there are still many Barrymores in Broadway. Therefore, the art world of the United States regards them as "The Most Royal Family of America."</p>
<p>Despite this, the Barrymore's family reputation is also very mysterious. They have very little contact with the outside world. News reporters are even less welcome. Therefore, what people know is only that they love art. Their homes have extremely rich libraries and extremely luxurious storage rooms. They have bought countless sculptures, antiques, and famous paintings, but no outsiders have ever been inside to visit. Recently, their attitude has changed somewhat, and they often hold grand banquets, but the only places guests can go are the magnificent living rooms, dining rooms, and gardens in their homes.</p>
<p>In films, they have always been independent of each other, striving for their own great careers. Although they live together, their lives are also very clearly separated.</p>
<p>Last year (1932), when there were major changes in the film industry, they had to cooperate on the screen. The first time was *Arsène Lupin* (already shown in Shanghai), and the second time was *Grand Hotel* (scheduled to be released in Shanghai in early March). The release of these two films has been welcomed around the world and has further increased their honor. In fact, this was only a collaboration between Lionel and John.</p>
<p>They recognized the path of modern art, and only cooperation can lead to greater success, so this recent collaboration has added Ethel. The name of the new film is *Rasputin*. It tells a Russian story, which was chosen by the three Barrymores themselves. Lionel plays an elderly and mysterious monk, John plays a great soldier of the empire, and another protagonist is a noblewoman, which is perfect for Ethel. With these three big stars playing these three equally important roles, the results will definitely be amazing. Moreover, the scenery and costumes are extremely realistic. It is said that MGM sacrificed a great deal for this film. People in the company believe that this is the only blockbuster after *Grand Hotel*. However, Ethel's eyes have not been very good recently, and she is unwilling to be too stimulated by the carbon arc lamps, so she only works for a very short time each day. This means that *Rasputin* will have to be completed at a later date.</p>

<h3 id="e288">Recent Fashion Trends in Hollywood <a href="#e288" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c288" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">288</a></h3>

<p>Probably in the summer of last year, Joan Crawford and Lili Damita started wearing bangs on their foreheads, which was considered fashionable for a while. Women in Hollywood followed suit, working hard with mirrors and scissors every day. Now Constance Bennett has invented a new type of bangs, which is a bunch of short hair, permed into a crescent shape, hanging on the left side of the eyebrow. When she first wore this style while filming RKO's new film "Rockabye," she was praised by the public, so many people followed suit, treating it as the most fashionable decoration.</p>
<p>Currently, the most popular fashion among women in Hollywood is a pointed felt hat. The reason why this felt hat is popular is because Ann Sothern received extremely high praise for wearing it in the film "Let's Fall in Love," so every Saturday afternoon, no fashionable woman in Hollywood is without this felt hat. This hat is called Mickey Mouse Hat in the United States and Breton Hat in the United Kingdom. It comes in various colors. Ann Sothern wears a brown one. Country girls used to wear this kind of hat, but unexpectedly, it has now become the darling in the eyes of fashionable people.</p>
<h3 id="e289">Wu Suxin's Way of Supporting Her Husband <a href="#e289" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c289" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">289</a></h3>
<p>— Ji Zhong</p>
<p>Zhang Huimin and Wu Suxin have a deep and affectionate relationship. Since Huimin Chinese Drama Company declared bankruptcy, Suxin has been worried about it. Later, during the January 28th Shanghai Incident, they risked filming "The Glorious History of the 19th Route Army." It was shown in various places inside and outside the port, and was very well received by people from all walks of life. Now Huimin and Suxin have decided to temporarily suspend the Huimin Chinese Drama Company and re-establish a new company, named Huimin. Recently, they have been actively proceeding and starting to shoot a film. The plot of the new film is still based on martial arts and love as the main themes, named "A Strange Encounter on a Desert Island," and has been completed to about 30 or 40 percent so far. Suxin has put in extraordinary efforts. Commentators say that Wu Suxin has a way of supporting her husband, which is indeed true.</p>
<p>The evening coat worn by Gwili Andre in the film "A Man's Mate" has elastic bands inside the clothes that can be stretched. The sleeves, which are invisible from the outside, are tight, and the cuffs are trimmed with a piece of leather. Everyone marvels at Gwili's cleverness. This kind of coat is called the champion of clothes, and it goes without saying that many people follow suit.</p>
<p>RKO star Mary Mason has recently been wearing a clever ring that can hold a photo inside. This has shocked the entire city of Hollywood again. If a fashionable man doesn't have a woman putting his photo in her ring, this person can be thrown into the Pacific Ocean.</p>
<p>Recently in Hollywood, a kind of woolen clothes worn for playing ball is popular, and the style worn by Fay Wray is the best. In the past six months, Fay Wray has prepared many of these woolen clothes, and she gives one as a gift whenever her friends have a birthday. But if you ask her for one, she will never give it. So her friends are looking forward to their birthdays coming soon.</p>
<p>Joel McCrea's clothes are now considered the most fashionable among men in Hollywood. He wears a British-style suit with leather buttons. Men in Hollywood are all wearing clothes made to imitate his style.</p>
<h3 id="e290">Tianyi's Military Reorganization <a href="#e290" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c290" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">290</a></h3>

<p>The two brothers Shao Zuiweng and Shao Cunren, the owners of Tianyi Company, in order to promote amateur sports for their employees and actors, have specially equipped a sports field very completely, with swings, see-saws, seesaws, wave boats, horizontal bars, etc. In addition, they have also organized basketball and football teams. The basketball team once had a friendly match with the basketball team of the China Wireless Radio School, and the result was undecided. On the afternoon of the 8th of this month, they will have a second match at the company's stadium. Shao Lao specially allocated a sum of money to prepare brand-new uniforms for the team members and purchased an American top-quality basketball. In addition to the original members Tang Xiaodan, Ma Loufen, Hua Ling, Zhang Zhenduo, Bao Zhichao, Li Xiongxiang, Fu Jiqiu, Wu Weiyun, Tian Fang, etc., Hu Yipei, Chen Shaoxian, Chen Yaorong, Chen Guanqian, etc. have recently joined. Recently, the team has been practicing very diligently during their spare time from work.</p>
<p>This is the sweet star Ann Sothern and her daughter Patricia. We met Ann Sothern in the film "Let's Fall in Love" the other day, but Patricia is not unfamiliar either. Look at her face, isn't she a little Ann Sothern?</p>
<p>Star Anecdotes</p>
<h3 id="e291">Jean Harlow's Anecdotes <a href="#e291" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c291" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">291</a></h3>
<p>— Mei Cun</p>
<p>Jean Harlow, the protagonist of "Three Wise Girls," is from Kansas City, Missouri, USA. She is now twenty-two years old.</p>
<p>Her father was a carpenter. When she was thirteen years old, her father died. For the sake of her future, her mother and she moved to Hollywood and rented an apartment there. At that time, there was an actor named Wyndham Standing who had just arrived in Hollywood from England to work in films. He also lived in this apartment, so they became acquainted with each other through frequent meetings. This was her first time approaching film industry figures.</p>
<p>Once, she went to Fox Company to find a friend. Because of her moving beauty, the friend took her to see the director. When the director saw her, he asked her to be an extra. Later, she was recruited by Hal Roach Company and signed a five-year contract.</p>
<p>A year later, Howard Hughes was about to start filming "Hell's Angels." The protagonist at the time was a beautiful Norwegian woman named Greta Nissen. After completing part of her work, she had to go to New York due to a contract with a certain stage, so a protagonist was missing. Hughes could not find a replacement among hundreds of actresses. At that time, James Hall and Ben Lyon (who played a young soldier in the film) happened to meet Jean Harlow and happily introduced her to Hughes. Hughes was very fond of her, and Jean's name became a sensation.</p>
<p>In July of this year, she married Paul Bern, and on September 6, Paul committed suicide. She suffered great grief. Recently, she has been filming "Red Dust."</p>
<h3 id="e292">Han Yunzhen After Marriage <a href="#e292" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c292" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">292</a></h3>
<p>— Qingxia</p>
<p>Han Yunzhen, everyone knows she is a veteran movie star; about six or seven years ago, her name was perhaps no less than that of Hu Die today. She acted in many plays, and because she was good at playing romantic roles, someone gave her the nickname "Sau Sister."</p>
<p>Since she left the film industry and got married, she developed an addiction, and her spirit became very weak, and her body was also very frail. The "beauty and health" of the past has been thrown to the winds. With a thin and pale face, no one would believe that she was the once-renowned Han Yunzhen in the film industry.</p>
<p>Her husband often advised her to quit; she also hated the addiction; and cursed her own absurdity. Therefore, she made up her mind to quit the addiction.</p>
<p>Now, she has quit her addiction, and her body seems to be much stronger; although she is already middle-aged, her former demeanor has been restored. She is almost ecstatic. According to reports, she may soon return to the screen as Feng Fu. Let us wait and see what happens next!</p>
<h3 id="e293">The Face of a Born Klutz <a href="#e293" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c293" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">293</a></h3>

<p>Aubrey Smith was born with uneven eyebrows. When he was working on the film "Of Human Bondage," he only had to stick on a fake mustache and didn't need much makeup, but he already had the face of a klutz. When the film was completed, Lubitsch joked to him, "Go home and wash the paint off your face, and take off those ugly mustache and eyebrows. Otherwise, no woman will love you."</p>
<h3 id="e294">Kissing Wax People is Not a Crime <a href="#e294" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c294" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">294</a></h3>
<p>— Ai</p>
<p>Playing Bridge is very fashionable in Hollywood. Once, three female stars asked Chico Marx (one of the four Marx Brothers) to join them for a game of Bridge, but stated that there would be no money involved. Chico said that playing Bridge for small stakes is like kissing a wax woman, it's meaningless. One of the female stars immediately said, "But forcibly kissing a wax person is at least not a crime, right?"</p>
<h3 id="e295">The Skills of the "Match King" (5) <a href="#e295" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c295" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">295</a></h3>
<p>— Translated by Ximeng</p>
<p>Paul Krüger still used his beauty trap. A Miss Sanya was seduced by Paul and gave her heart to him. But Paul introduced her to Mr. Rodinski, a Polish banker. Rodinski was the Polish government's chief financial officer. So Paul arranged the spider's web and hid aside to wait for the opportunity. Rodinski rented a small house for Sanya in Warsaw, the capital of Poland, and decorated it like a fairy palace. It was exclusively for his personal entertainment in his spare time, and Sanya was considered his bedroom.</p>
<p>One day Paul went to Warsaw to visit Sanya. She said with a smile, "Paul, you are a liar, you are going to tell me many sweet words again."</p>
<p>"My dear," Paul's voice was very low, he embraced Sanya in his arms, his heart was pounding so hard that it could almost be heard, and his face showed many emotions of parting, more real than real. "If words could describe the pain of not seeing you... you will never know how many times I wanted to put aside all my business, regardless of Stockholm, London, New York, Paris, all the banks, railways, factories, just to come to you here." He kissed her hand, he knelt beside her, hand in hand, eye to eye. "What I am doing is for our future, so that we can never be separated and enjoy the happiness of peace." He stood up and kissed Sanya passionately.</p>
