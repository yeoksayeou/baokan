<p>時評</p>
<h3>放棄灤東（衷）</h3>
<p>自前年九一八禍變發生以來。抗日問題之在我國。即終始有如一謎。若謂終始不抵抗。則抵抗之呼聲。固無日不洋洋盈耳。請纓之電。亦無日不見報端。若認爲抵抗。則一國之内。此處抗戰。彼處觀望。無通盤之籌劃。尤無一貫之策略。零星抗戰。其結果終歸於各個擊破。此種迷離惝恍之現象。誠爲無可理解。</p>
<p>一年半以來。在此種迷離惝恍之現象下。始則遼吉黑相繼陷落。繼則楡關接踵淪亡。一月以前。熱河夭險。復自動放棄。寇入日深。疆土日蹙。而此種現象之延續。則依然如故。兹者繼冷囗陷落之後。灤東又已撤退。扼守喜峯口之宋哲元部。則陷於孤軍苦鬥之狀態中。而灤河以東所搆成之三角地帶。約計一千五百英方哩之版土。至此又陷入敵軍之手矣。</p>
<p>據電訉所傳。撫寗昌黎一帶之我軍。自前晩起開始撤退。</p>
<p>敵第一次入秦皇島者僅二百人。灤東難民。旣遭炸彈之襲擊。復遭刧掠之苦痛。婦孺委頓途中。尤多被蹂躪。哭聲震野。天地爲愁。吾人試一閉目默想此種慘毒之景象寗能不。</p>
<p>爲之痛苦。而同時另一方面之消息。則又爲宋哲元部孤軍苦鬥。團營覆没者比比。犧牲之壯烈。眞可以動天地而泣鬼神。嗚呼。此逃難之人民。此戰死之將士。果何爲乎。爲國家而犧牲乎。抑爲民族而犧牲乎。血洒沙場。骨埋荒草。老弱轉徙。少壯流離。太陽敵旗。望平津而直指。鐵蹄到處。山河變色。然而我中央則方致力於「剿匪」。西南則日作出兵之宣傳。其他各省。亦惟袖手作壁上觀。國家前途。尙堪問乎。</p>
<p>就去年上海之抗戰與此次宋哲元部在口外苦鬥諸役觀之。我士氣非不可以一戰也。我軍力亦非不可以一用也。同時據熊希齡氏自前方來訉述軍民抗日眞相。謂「河北各縣農民將車輛騾馬柴草輸送於軍隊者。已達千萬。車輛一項。</p>
<p>得二百五十萬。遵化一縣。已達百萬。皆農民血汗所出。毁家紓難。爲國犠牲。」則民氣固亦非不可以一戰也。兵非不可戰之兵。民非甘心亡國之民。然而竟莫肯一决戰。吾人誠百思而莫得一解。</p>
<p>吾人認爲今日事已至急。滅亡之禍。已迫近眉睫。即欲鎭靜而不可得。抑且以人口衆多逹於四萬萬之民族。而竟皆束手瞑目以待死。此復成何景象。民心惶惶。懼不終朝。今日之事究如何。政府應亟作最後周密之考慮。</p>

<h3>「僞國」與中東路</h3>
<p>俄僞交涉毫無結果</p>
<p>義軍活躍火車脱軌</p>
<p>字林報三月三十一日哈爾濱通訉云、哈埠人士目前咸盛談鐵路問題、各報亦連篇累牘、紀載此事、其最後結果、未能豫測、故人心極形緊張、本日據報載、上星期路警發覺有機車四輛、將圖駛入俄境、</p>

<p>蘇俄貨物經過滿洲由西運東問題、及上年蘇俄所運去中東鐵路機車貨車迄未交還問題、現已漸轉劇烈、蓋中東路「滿洲國」總董屢向蘇俄副總董提出抗議、未接隻字覆文、故「滿洲國」交通部次長日人森田、已率日部員二人來哈、與蘇俄討論該問題、「滿洲國」代表曾與俄董會商數次、毫無結果、蘇俄副總董僅稱、已將此事呈報莫斯科政府、按蘇俄向由滿洲里假道中東路運貨至濱海諸省、蘇俄之製造品均由政府專利、故此項貨物、實際乃政府所有、其運費槪不付現、僅載入公司之賬册、作爲蘇俄政府所欠、積至今日、數逹二百萬金盧布、公司中另有與中政府之往來賬册、凡中政府運輸物品與軍隊、槪不繳納運費、而在賬中掛欠、蘇俄政府以爲蘇俄固有權如中政府所爲、俾將來雙方欠數相等時、得相抵銷、惟「滿洲國」當道則稱、雙方合同中無如此運貨規定、故擬加禁阻、至於上年蘇俄政府運入俄境之貨車、據稱、此項貨車、中東路並未繳價、緣當歐戰之際、恊約國曾在美國購有許多物品、運至海參崴、經滿洲輸往歐洲俄境、其中有貨車一大批、由英國購交俄政府者、而分拆運至哈爾濱交納、俾可在中東路工廠集合、今寓哈之人、尙有可證明此事者、嗣因俄國革命、迄未交與俄政府、故蘇俄政府今應襲有之云、「滿洲國」當道則稱、凡中東路之貨車、悉爲公司之産、昨日「滿洲國」交通部代表與蘇俄副總董庫斯尼索夫會商時、庫稱、凡屬於中東路之貨車、自應交還、惟蘇俄政府所以爲不屬於中東路者、不在此列云、觀俄文報之紀載、該問題現極棘手、但不致如數報所言、恐將引起戰爭之惡劣、西比利亞近雖有兵變之流言、而蘇俄政府對於滿洲問題、仍作充分之軍事準備、以防决裂、再北滿日軍、多調往熱河作戰、所餘兵力、殊爲單薄、此際開戰、愚莫如之、故料雙方終可商妥滿意之解决方法也、</p>

<h3>主席致詞</h3>
<p>主席王曉籟、於席間起立致歡送詞、原文關係重大、</p>
<p>特略誌其槪要如下、宋部長以行政院副院長兼　財政部長之地位、於時局緊急聲中、奉政府之任命、離國赴美、參與在華盛頓召集之世界經濟會議、敝會等鋻於此行使命之重大、爰於今日、設會招待、致獻曝之忱、并表期望之意、蓋自我國目前情形言、所謂戰債問題、關税問題、爲經濟會議之中心者、在我國或則無直接關係、或則此較尙屬次要、此次美國經濟會議之召集、凡歐洲二三流國家、均未被邀、而我國獨以遠東關係較淺、且正忙於應付外患之國家、乃與歐洲諸重要國家、一律邀赴會議、足徵經濟會議、係其表面、而内容决不如是簡單、日人窺破此層、是亦預先有非正式之表示、謂本會議中、不能涉及東三省問題、但日人之所以能肆志於遠東、旣侵占四省、復攻擾濼東、即以歐美方因工人失業問題、戰債支付問題、國力方在疲敝之中、對於日本、不能作有效之制裁、是以日本視此時爲千載一時之良機、故今日歐美欲干涉日本之暴舉、必先調整各國之内部、使元氣漸次昭蘇、然後行動方能有效、我國爲歐美在遠東絶大之巿塲、當此事變、我固有所需於彼、而彼亦有所需於我、宜於可能範圍内、對於歐美經濟不振之狀况、即其一臂之力、使本會議之任務以我國之從中努力、而收圓满效果、則間接於東省問題、亦有良好之影響、所謂致力在此而收效在彼也、此次會議、可謂列强之幹部會議、其重要性或在昔年九國公約華盛頓會議之上、吾國應如何有剴切之陳述、以動世界列强之聽、使知世界經濟問、</p>
<p>題、不能離中國經濟問題而獨立、而中國經濟問題、又不能離東北問題而獨立、使其有澈底之覺悟、以變更其遠東政策、此則一席之談話、其效力遠勝於公開之提案、吾人所望於宋部長者此其二、外患日棘遺大投艱非公莫屬、車轄出發爲期在即、敬舉一觴以祝此行之成功、</p>
<h3>代表演説</h3>
<p>席間各團體代表、亦相繼致詞、兹誌其要點如下、（一）史量才致詞云、此次世界經濟會議、極關重要、以宋部長之地位、及宋部長於各友邦之信譽、自然應該宋部長親自去、故於此歡送會中、希望宋部長能於出席之後、能以新鮮空氣來解决各公轉餞宋茶話會（李尊庸攝）</p>
<p>國内的沉悶、及希望能逹到經濟制裁日本云云、（二）李馥蓀致詞、略述此次宋部長决定出席世界經濟會議之經過、繼述以宋部長廢兩改元　之毅然决然的精神、必能於出席之後、爭得不少利益回、并希能於回國之後、使我國經濟財政、能闢一新生命、或即於遠東問題、得有一解决辦法云云、（三）虞洽卿詞云、中國現在處處失敗、遭人凌逼、若能於經濟奮鬥出一血路、亦可以制勝敵人、蓋鞏固經濟以後、然後再濟之以武力、未有不能勝利者、日本袛中國十分之一、被之所以稱强者、全頼紙幣維持、亦頼其全國上下同心恊力、故我國如能同心恊力而抵抗、必有佔優勢之一日、故此次宋部長赴美國出席、一方面希望全國人民與政府合作、一方面希望宋部長能爲國努力云云、（四）貝淞蓀致詞云、鄙人此次追隨宋部長出國、係彷彿參謀的地位、向來我國政府、出使國外代表、從未有我商人參加者、而此次宋部長居然來找到商人、足見虚懷若谷、而能爲人民着想、財政部長向來祗專爲籌欵、但宋部長則不但注意處理財政、而極注重於國中整個的經濟問題、此蓋知經濟問題、實即總理所説之「民生」兩字、世界經濟之不景氣、現已逹於極度、華會之召集、我國當然須以意見貢獻於大會、且極可使世界各國注意、故此次會議、實與我工商業有直接關係者、宋部長邀鄙人參與、備爲　諮詢、余亦極願追隨、俾有所貢獻、惟鄙人才疎學淺、我工商業界長才博識者甚多、深恐有負期望云云、</p>
<h3>宋氏致答</h3>
<p>各團體代表致詞畢、即由宋部長起立致答詞云、兄弟今日蒙上海巿商會銀錢業公會地方恊會等欵待歡送、非常感激、兄弟此次决定出席華盛頓世界經濟會之經過、頃間已由李馥蓀先生、述其槪要、</p>
<p>惟當美國柬邀我國時、余因鋻於内憂外患之日亟、本不預備前去出席、嗣經各方之催促、及詳加考慮後、覺此次世界經濟會議、雖非直接與遠東問題有關、然因相互的關係、及有關世界整個經濟問題之故、當即决定參加、并爲迅速赴美起見、即决定於明日即行起程、以我國現在經濟而言、農村破産、商業凋敝、通貨咸流入都巿、尤其是上海、生産力日益衰弱、</p>
<p>其所以致此之原因、則爲長江水災、共匪爲患、及日本之經濟侵略我巿場、武力場佔我東四省、凡兹三點、皆我國因是而發生之特殊困難情形、然經濟不景氣、爲全世界普遍現狀、不僅我國如是、即以號稱富有之美國、亦難免於此、失業工人、佔一千五百餘萬、以人口比例、若包含其家族人於其内、三人之中、失業佔三分之在、美國如是、其他各國、亦可知矣、故現一欲解决國内經濟困難、决非各個力量所能辦到、如築長城以閉關自守、必合全世界各國、共同解决庶幾有望、各國在昔、對於經濟問題、亦嘗行築長城政策、</p>
<p>如提高關税壁壘、現在已覺其非是、中央此次派兄弟前去出席、亦即因欲解决國内經濟困難、必須與全世界共同解决之意、但此去决不是去求人、因中國有廣大之土地、四萬萬人中口、爲世界最偉大巿塲、於挽救解决經濟危機、將有極大之貢獻於世界、正可與各國開誠相見、互相交換意見、討論解决辦法、現在日本如是蠻横、我國若專重武力、不於經濟上致力、</p>
<p>實係錯誤、蓋國家猶一人體、决不是僅恃一右手肌肉之堅實、可以健全、可以無恐、必須全體機能完全運用、始克有濟、故此次雖係一經濟問題、但是亦係全國的問題、亦係全世界的問題、今日歡送者全係各界英俊、以往翊助兄弟、共濟艱難、</p>
<p>感荷德意、不僅個人、兄弟明日登輪之後、即係站於國民的地位、故兄弟此次前去出席、雖係代表政府、然亦係代表人民、</p>
<p>此行能不辱命、全頼政府與人民之督促指遵、故抵美以後、希望隨時有電文來貢獻意見、實行加以督促、兄弟亦當隨時以詳細情形、向諸位報吿云云、至六時許、</p>
<p>始行散會、</p>
<h3>汪精衛昨晚返京</h3>
<p>臨行發表書面負責談話</p>
<p>謂西南反對全會難索解</p>
<p>不勦共匪卽等於不抗日</p>
<p>汪氏因須出席今日之行政會議、故於昨晚乘十一時三十分夜快車返京、路局特附掛花車一輛、備汪乘坐、汪因背部作痛、故於十時四十五分、即抵站上車安臥、</p>
<p>同行者除其夫人陳壁君女士外、尙有曾仲鳴·陳公博·焦易堂·王正廷·劉瑞恒·</p>
<p>等、又蔣軍委長夫人宋美齡女士、亦於昨晚乘夜車晋京、鐵道部長顧孟餘、則定今晨早車返京、</p>
<p>汪氏昨日發表書面談話云、（問）西南中央委員寒日通電、仍然反對中央召集臨時全國代表大會、討論决定提前召集國民大會、先生對之感想如何、（答）西南中央委員、似乎忘記了兩件事、其一、第五次全國代表大會、按照黨章、須於今年十一月舉行、如今於七月一日開臨時全國代表大會、不過提前數月、其二、國民大會、依照三中全會决定、應於二十四年四月召集、如今所謂提前、亦不過提前一年半載、中央常會、鍳於國家的危急存亡、主張提前、實具有充分理由、而他們的反對、似乎不祇是反對提前、直是反對開全國代表大會及國民大會、可謂解人難索、</p>
<p>（問）蔣委員長在南昌演説、有在此勦共嚴重時期、而主張抗日、應該嚴屬處置等語、頗引起外間疑問、先生以爲如何、（答）我們看蔣委員長的演説詞、切不可斷章取義、現在華北軍隊的任務、在於抗日、</p>
<p>江西軍隊的任務、在於勦共、一様爲國家出力、一様重要、但是如果在江西的軍隊、忘記了當前勦共的任務、而請纓抗日、是無異使共黨有隙可乘、所以蔣委員長不能諄諄吿誡、尤其甚者、竟有些人主張應該移勦共之師以抗日、殊不知共匪於國難嚴重之際、仍然在江西等處暴動、</p>
<p>此無異爲虎作倀、由此言之、勦共即抗日、不勦共即等於不抗日、我們須明白這一層、然後對於蔣委員長演説詞、不致誤解</p>

<h3>華安大厦中昳麗少婦自殺</h3>
<p>夜半離奇電話招約醫生</p>
<p>卒因服毒過深難救一命</p>
<p>丨凄凉之日記······可憐之身世丨</p>
<p>昨晨　五時許、靜安寺路華安大厦四樓、第四百十二號房内、發生一妙齡少婦服毒自殺案、兹將本報記者調查所得、分紀於下、</p>
<p>（昳麗少婦）　斯案女主角爲一廣東女子、自稱姓陳、名素芬、年約二十六七歲、貌極昳麗、衣服入時、舉止亦頗闊綽、於本月十三日往華安大厦開闢第四百十二號房間、按月房金二百元、數日來女每約異性友朋出遊、深宵方返、前晚十時許、陳獨自僱車外出、至午夜回寓、即上床安息、至昨晨二時許、有一男友往華安、與之閒談、直至四時許、始辭出、未幾、</p>
<p>（離奇電話）　白克路寳隆醫院、忽接得一電話、謂華安大厦四百十二號房内有一女子服毒、請醫生趕速前去、時該院値班者、即問其何處來電話、則答東亞五零八號所打、該院以各醫師均已返家、乃吿以醫師羅侯之住址及電話、請其直接打去、果然未至片刻、羅醫師家中、竟亦接到上項電話、因此羅醫師立即携帶應用藥品、趕往華安大厦、</p>
<p>（命在須臾）　直上四樓、向侍者訉問有無女子服毒、詎各侍者竟茫然不知、羅醫師乃吿以電話中曾説四百十二號房間、侍者乃陪該醫師前往叩門數次不應、用手推之、詎房門未扃、呀然而啓、則見房中果有一女子身穿綢睡衣、僵臥床上、面色慘白、床前小桌上放有安神藥片二瓶、嘔吐狼藉滿地、呼吸急促、細若游絲、唇部有焦灼狀、果然未幾又在内室浴缸旁、發現來沙爾一瓶、羅醫師見狀、知該少婦命在、</p>
<p>須臾、</p>
<p>（香消玉殞）　急爲之注射强心劑、奈受毒過深、竟未見效、羅醫師乃又通知寳隆醫院、派車將伊車往醫院、一面報吿新閘捕房、經各醫師悉心施救、终無希望、延至昨晨十時五十分、竟香消玉殞、當由該院報吿捕房、將屍車往騐屍所、一面派探目陸根弟率領探捕分往華安·東亞·兩處查勘、</p>
<p>並調查所謂五零八號内之人物、以便追詢内幕、</p>
<p>（遺書父母）　並在伊臥室一小衣箱内、發見先施存摺一扣、計洋一千五百元、鈔洋一百七十六元、鑽戒一只、異常珍貴、已身及異姓朋友小照數幀、華麗衣服十餘件、遺書一通、係致其父母者、僅一信箋未封固、故亦無從得悉其父母住址、另有日記簿一本、係平常小洋簿、自一月一日起記至三月廿六日爲止、用鉛筆書冩、字跡潦草、不易辨識、均由捕房帶回存案、</p>
<p>（日記凄凉）　該少婦日記、記者曾於忽促間批閲一過、大都怨恨之詞、其三月二日所記、有「駱先生來談了好久、還是談不出怎麽好辦法來、」「駱先生怎麽會介紹怎様一個糊塗朋友呢、」尙有許多記載關於一女子呌瑞姊者、如「唉、瑞姊、你現在那裏、你可知道世界上一個怎様愚痴的正戀着你嗎、」「我在杭州曾經求過一籤、問我和瑞姊將來到底怎様結局」、但其中最堪注意者、厥爲三月二十六日一葉、如「付麽事、</p>
<p>情亦被我享受過、假使再留存在世上、亦覺得没有什麽意味了」、「我現在還不自殺的緣由、唯一就是爲着湘舲無人撫養、其次就是恐怕我父親聞到這種消息、必定爲我氣死」、「我也曾帮助了家裏不可、</p>
<p>伹是從前已經給我弄得家破人亡、人家一定要説我是一個妖精」、綜觀日記前後鬱鬱不樂、情態反常、</p>
<p>（少婦身世）　後探員等又發現伊滬地友人住址有名余志博者、住法租界吕班路萬宜坊十號當由探目陸根第報吿捕頭、轉知法捕房會同前往查詢、據稱該少婦確係粤人、時常往來滬粤、朋友甚多、與余妻爲閨友、並悉伊曾於數年前出嫁、生一女（即湘舲）、嗣因雙方忽生意見（大約男方主動）、遷賦仳離、女孩由伊撫育、感許伊受此刺激、因此忽萌短見、總之不外乎情變而已、所有該少婦身後之事、現由余志博爲之料理、遺骸待檢騐後將轉送膠州路萬國殯儀館棺殮、至於東亞五零八號經各探員前往調查、始終並無該少婦所藏相片中其人、故刻下捕房尙在追尋線索中、</p>

<h3>安不忘危危不忘安</h3>
<p>— 瞻廬</p>
<p>（割）　畀英國已經百年之久的香港，仗着大不列顚的雄風，誰也不敢動着襲擊的妄想，但，在本月五號至六號，香港軍察當局大演其海陸空軍的戰衛，調兵遣將的忙碌，眞有如火，如荼，如雲蒸，如霞蔚的洋洋大觀。</p>
<p>預遣蔑成，巴力兩戰艦，裝載林肯隊陸軍兩旅，海軍陸戰隊二百，飾作襲擊香港九龍新界等處的敵人；無固定時間，無切實地點，祇須有隙卽人，發揮其聲東擊西的戰略，藉此試騐被襲擊方面的防守實力和應敵方法。</p>
<p>雖是個假意兒·却操演的情景逼眞；敵分兩路進攻香港，一由將軍澳登陸牵制，一由淺水灣偷盗襲擊，於是兩軍在黃泥涌主力接觸，　晨光熹微的時候，戰至九時三十分，防守軍用着大包圖勢，得到晨　　　，指揮官乃宣布停戰，返營休息。</p>
<p>香港軍事當局宣言：「此次操演，倘是眞的敵人來偷襲　　令其全軍覆没。」絃外餘音，可見彼國人處處防範嚴密，有「安不忘危　的意思。論到吾們這號稱五族一家的大中華民國呢，五族　成爲他族，一家大閙其分家，肆行侵略的倭人，從關東打到關内，從關内打到華北來了，長江流域也處處都有被敵人襲擊的可能性，但是，一般高談闊論的在好老，游其山，玩其水，大興土木，而廣納其如夫人，這也有一説，這呌做：「危不忘安。」</p>
<h3>讀書</h3>
<p>— 趙子明</p>
<p>書中自有黃金屋，書中自有顔如玉，」這是古人讀書的目的，亦是他們的希望，因爲讀書有官做，做了官大刮民脂民膏’金屋自然可以藏嬌。</p>
<p>但是現在讀書有什麽用處？讀書想做官吧？那簡直難如登青天，除非你的岳丈或姐夫做到什麽部長，委員······否則你雖有满腹文章，亦有餓死竈前之慮！</p>
<p>記得去年舉行高等考試，統計公私所耗用費，不下數十萬，考試及格的，究有幾位得了官？</p>
<p>退一步説，讀書以後，不作官夢，想憑勞力换飯吃，但是社會像烏鴉一樣黑，有了學問，不會吹牛拍馬，亦是枉然。路上常見大學畢業生，坐在水門汀上，大寫其粉筆字，乞行路人援助，試問中學，小學畢業生，呌他們幹什麽？</p>
<p>博士，學士帽雖然加在大學生的頭上，但是等於空招牌。那末要讀什麽書？不過要吃飯，非從拍馬吹牛上去用功夫不可。「書中自有黃金屋，書中自有顔如玉」這句話根本不對。應改成「拍馬自有黃金屋，吹牛自有顔如玉。」才應時世之潮流！</p>
<h3>舊貨攤</h3>
<p>— 公瑜</p>
<p>北京路上，柏油澆的石路兩畔，你假使有閒的話，你大可去觀光一回，這裏肩軋肩脚碰脚的舊貨行同業，寳在不少；况且他們也很歡迎顧客們參觀，不一定要買他貨物的·</p>
<p>走進他們店舖中，衣服穿得整齊一些，他們也會很慇懃地和你交談·假使經濟家跑進去，他們也會擺出中國商人特有的習慣，面部上恕不招待的招貼表現出來；注視着你，任你去一件一件的鑑賞·</p>
<p>他們店址雖然湫隘簡陋，但是他們的宗旨，却不願抱着「金玉其外，敗絮其中·」我大胆地敢保證一句説，你走進去以後，包你目不睱接·這裏有满清時官吏用的朝靴，朝帽，和自標爲宋朝元朝銅的器，瓷器，一頪的古物·有舶來品的無線電收音機，打字機，留聲機等一類科學利器·並且還有龐然大器的家用什物，和織小的五金零件·但是陳列最多的，則要推半新舊的皮鞋和呢帽了·他們用極經濟的資金，蒐羅得這樣廣博，簡直和一家古今歷史博物館一樣，眞是一件很不容易的事·</p>
<p>但是你跑進去了以後，自頭至尾看了一遍·你總不免看中意幾件，愛不忍釋地把它買下·它的代價，往往比同樣新的賤下一半；假使這一件貨他們收進時價巧的話，或者竞廉至三分之一·</p>
<h3>從私家偵探説到偵探小説</h3>
<p>— 生</p>
<p>輓近社會表面愈趨繁華，而外强中乾。實不足恃。各業破産。農村崩潰。國中經濟恐慌已逹極點，因之作奸犯科越貨殺人之罪案層見疊出，試一披覽報紙，何日蔑有？則破案雪冤，提要鈎元，偵探尤爲需要矣。然而人才難得，無足稱述，令人興才難之歎也。</p>
<p>歐美之偵探，除公家而外，尙有私家偵探，而私家偵探所奏之成績，往往較諸官塲中者爲優，則其中固自有原因也。吾國之偵探大都出自公門，經騐雖有，而學識短絀，是以對於罪案之破，未能悉如人意。且犯罪之徒有用科學方法殺人者，則偵探必知科學，而後能獲蹤跡也，然而求能有普通常識之外能明科學者寳鮮，而私家偵探則尤闕如，未見通行，不足爲官塲之助也。吾友金君喜治偵探之學。自立宏願，欲他日爲一私家偵探，摘奸發覆，使人心大快，未知其將來能逹目的否？</p>
<p>金君喜讀偵小説，西方之福爾摩斯探案固極微妙，然嫌不合於中國人心理，而中國之偵探小説作家則甚尠焉。渠謂合乎情理而能啓發人智者，厥爲程小青氏所作之霍桑探案，有一讀之値價，且寓意尤能針砭社會犯罪者之心理也。按程著霍桑探案外集今方出版，大受讀者歡迎，許爲東方福爾摩斯。余希望金程二君，一則努力著作之日新，一則努力於學識之日進，爲我國偵探界光也。（酬助東北難民）</p>
<h3>應酬的藝術</h3>
<p>— 徐本煕</p>
<p>應酬，一名寒暄，是賽主間或其他情形下促入正文的端倪。一個人要在社會上交際活動·便不免地要懂得如何應酬。惟其寒暄多虚無不實之辭·應酬便形成了藝術。所謂藝術，在我個人觀察裏，是至少能利用天·地·人·</p>
<p>時。</p>
<p>天和地，不是説天文地理，意思是，</p>
<p>談話之中，儘先把眼前的天時拉爲資料。譬如人們對你説；這幾天天氣好極了，太陽多麽和暖啊！在你，當然也知道天氣好，但你還是該回答的。你應當説：是的·春天眞舒服愉快。否則·你也當説：果然，天没有下雨，風是夠人陶醉的。從而，依此頪推，把你所知道關於天地的理論經騐者説出來，人們不説你「能言善辯博學多才」者幾希！</p>
<p>至於人和時·那和天地有些兒差别的。假使係有求於對方或對方有給你借重的地方時，那没，對方所讚譽的人物，即使在你是認爲辭臣賊子，烏龜忘八，你也得説：是呀，天下這樣成功的人有幾個呢？或者説：這樣的人物，勢必救中國！這樣，對於你倆所欲談的正文上·至少有一點藝術的基礎來速於成就。進之，談到時世，你就應該大發議論。你儘知道國事糟到這般地步，空言無補實際，但你還應該竭力談論。假如你可能的話，你應該拍案高呼，以至於流涙　你能利用天地人時四個字，那你有飯吃了。</p>
<p>或者你要説：這樣詐僞和滑稽的處世藝術，夠多麽無聊？那你該知道，今日的社會和世界，比這樣更詐僞和滑稽的多着哩！</p>

<h3>東北四連長</h3>
<p>— 張恨水</p>
<p>第四回</p>
<p>情局復開茶寮傾</p>
<p>年關難渡質庫作</p>
<p>伊拿兩塊錢和幾張毛票，放在階　石上瞪了油匠一眼道：</p>
<p>你拿去。説畢，拖了母親的手　就走進屋子來了。江氏看見油匠走了，就低聲道：咱們該人家的錢，話要好説，爲什麽一提起來就生氣呢？桂枝道：你瞧他那樣子，我們能夠不生氣嗎？「江老太在家嗎」？母女二人正在屋子裏互相埋怨着哩：</p>
<p>這一句可怕的問話，又在窗子外發出來了。桂枝道：誰？外面答應着，煤店裏的。桂枝覺得他母親不容易對付債主，自已就迎了出來，看見煤舖掌櫃的，穿了老羊皮襖子，戴了皮帽子，</p>
<p>脇下夾了好幾本厚賬簿，便道：掌櫃的，我該你們多少錢？掌櫃的笑道：大姑娘我昨天就送了賬條子來了，不多，五塊來錢。你們老太太，約了我今天來取錢的。桂枝道：我跟你商量商量，先付你一半······掌櫃的捧了賬簿子，連連笑着作揖道：大姑娘·别呀，别呀！我今年也是不得了。桂枝道：不得了，也不至於靠我們兩三塊錢就好了。掌櫃的笑道：你是聰明人，你想想，若是每家都欠一半給一半，我得了嗎？都是多年主顧，</p>
<p>我又能説，那個當清，那個當欠呢？大姑娘，帮個忙罷。那油匠是挺有錢，你都照數給他了，我這樣央吿着您，您也不好意思駁回。説着，他又連連作揖。桂枝自負能抵擋債户，到了現在，也就没有法子了。便道：我不管你去和我媽説罷。説畢，</p>
<p>他倒一抽身走了。江氏没有法子，只好走了出來。這個煤店的掌櫃，眞是會討錢，他一味的向人家吿饒，閙得江氏一點辦法没有，只好如數的將錢付了。這兩筆債，旣是照付了，討債的人，偏是知道了消息。（四五）</p>

<p>或問於予曰，忠於國家，忠於職務，是興國的要素，至於孝字，不是功利時代所需要，予曰：中國的忠孝仁義等字，本來是極抽象極抽象的字，大聖大賢是眞了解的，愚夫愚婦是行易知難的，我輩中材之士，大都持「旣不能令又不受命」的態度，然有兩條路可以起信：（甲）從讀書人手者，泛覧他書，初不信之，讀中國史，於成敗興亡中，察其自召禍福，乃如影之随形，則信之，（孔二老爺於論語本文，其背景是千聖百王的歷史，人如果將資治通鑑看過一遍的，其信論語之心，可以引起）（乙）從辦事入手者，百事順利，初不信之，躬遇艱難，於無聊極思中，姑且歸根周孔，乃竟試之有效，則亦信之，且忠孝仁義者，用南北宋派的不足以救危亡，用中山先生派的則不離國事而空談也，今分數條答覆之如下，（一）如果張學良知道「孝」字東三省熱河晃至於失，白公勝報父讐者也，伍子胥報父讐者也，吳王夫差報父讐者也，岳武穆遵母敎而殺敵者也，顧亭林遵母敎而仇虔者，此數人者，名垂史册，然而徵引史事，貽笑文盲，且擬人亦不倫也，水滸傳是時髦的語體文，可以徵引的了，水滸傳的李逵，老虎咬死他媽，李逵立卽搗虎穴殺虎子，這是人人所知的，張學良者，豈不知父死誰手嗎？豈不知博浪大鐵椎是他的老師椎人的，新民屯大炸彈是他的老頭子被炸的嗎？不學梁山泊傅忠義之李逵，愛學甘州曲落風塵之王衍，以此制敵，以此圖功，宜其遼寗嗚呼，吉黑哀哉，而熱河尙饗也，這明明是不孝者不能忠國之一證；（二）在十年之前江蘇督軍某，丁父憂，江蘇人聞之，甚爲欣躍，預備開歡送會，致電總統，謂督軍當然「孝思不匱，回籍治喪」，督軍本人電致政府，謂自願「奪情報國，在職心喪」，厥後江浙兩省演了四十幾日的内戰，屍山血海，民不聊生，議者謂爲「鴉片私税戰爭」，這也是不孝者不能忠國之一證；（三）齊桓公葵邱之會，其盟書第一句曰「誅不孝，」齊桓公「攘夷之霸主」也，惟其知國内崇孝，乃能知國外攘夷，故孔子質管仲曰，如其仁，如其仁，微管仲，吾其被髮左袵矣，而管仲書亦曰，禮義廉恥，國之四維，四維不張，國乃滅亡；（四）中國是家族制度的國，（這是總理全書上所最稱讚的）中國又是不立宗敎的國；中國又是識字運動未普遍的國，獨這一個「孝」字，第一是保持家族制度以綿延人頪，第二是不須宗敎形式而騙人向善，第三是最普及的種富强不增，貧弱不减的敎育，具此三善，是故以守則固，以戰則克也；（五）兹更有附吿者，最近英儒司禮門氏（Ｊ·Ｈ·ＳＬＥＥＭＡＮ）著一書名爲「白色之中國」（ＷＨＩＴＥ　ＣＨＩＮＡ），書中説中國文化甚詳，并稱許十九路軍淞滬一戰的忠勇，比之英國名將納爾遜（ＮＥＬＳＯＮ）之戰略，書中説日本之野蠻行爲，比之汪德羅族（ＶＡＮＤＡＬ）之土番舉動，嗚乎，如司禮門者，惟其知中國崇尙「忠孝仁愛，信義和平，」故其著書也代中國抵抗日本，英儒愛中國，可謂仁人君子之用心矣，繆篆日，吾猶及見以文章報國者矣，甲午戰事起，不三月而出十二厚本的「普天忠憤集」，今亡矣夫！</p>

<h3>關於『農村裏回得去嗎』問題</h3>
<p>討論函件一束</p>
<p>（十一）本埠王龍章君來信！要回農村應該　　先有辦法</p>
<p>「到農村去」，「到農村去」，這是近幾年來最時髦的口號，這也是國内正在討論得最爲熱烈的問題。近幾天讀了讀者顧問欄内的關於「農村裏回得去嗎？」的討論的文字，參加論戰者先後已有雄聲君，尤懷阜君，劉思民君等人，他們各有各的立塲，各有各的見解，我雖不學無文，很願乘此機會來發表些自已終年的榮迥於腦海的拙見，以目前的中國言：百分之八十以上的是農民，全部農村因受帝國主義者經濟侵略的關係正在破産，失業問題成了唯一的病症，所以回到農村去的答案，是當然的，是絶對的，用不着什麽深刻的討論，不過我們現在要研究的，並不是回得去回不去的問題，而是「怎樣同到農村去」的問題，種田麽？假使自已無田可種的人怎麽辦？敎書麽？假使連一個鄉村小學的敎員位置總謀不到又怎麽辦？至於談到農村建設麽？假使缺乏了雄厚資本與科學人才等等先决問題，更怎麽辦？這些一切的一切，均在値得研究和討論之列，假使儘喊回到農村去的口號，事先並無適當的計劃，依然無補於一般失業人們的冀求，誠如本報答覆雄聲君所説「城巿固然不易找到工作，卽在鄉間亦難謀生，在這種情形之下，想回到農村去專爲謀生起見，那我們實在看不出什麽樂觀的前途，不但没有樂觀的前途，並且只有依然餓着肚子去做農村失業者，」尤君儘管在主張「都巿中志士仁人，到鄉村中去領導農民來改造建設，解除痛苦，······做些益國惠民的工作，」試問在此「農村經濟破産的呼聲，不但到處可以聽到，就在實際的日常情形上，也可看到有很多很多的因爲遭過着天災人禍的結果而不堪立足，便奔到城巿裏來確非少數，······整個農村的本身都無法維持，更何能來安挿外來的人」的時候，究有什麽方法能跑到農村去，大而爲社會謀福利，小而爲個人謀生活呢，一言以蔽之，回到農村裏去並不難，貴在有「計畫」而已矣。至於尤君爲雄聲君所設計的辦小學，賣熟藥等妙策，不用説是行得通，與行不通，在在都成了問題，卽使能一帆風順，照樣進行，也不過是局部的，個人的所謂滄海之一粟，小而又小的解决，對於諾大的中國農村，仍難醫除病根，對於廣衆的失業同胞，仍難澈底解决，總之，我覺得雄聲君之徬徨的歧途和苦悶的呐喊，正是中國當前青年們一致的現象，這是一個絶大的政治和社會的問題，與你遭有同樣境况的正不知千千萬萬，用不着悲觀，用不着消極，諒你能寫出這樣深思而暢逹的文字，至少賣文投稿，也可得一點大餅油條的微資，在那没有詳切計畫以前，萬勿誤信標語口號憑空地跑到農村去，再加上一個所謂「農村失業者」的頭銜，（注意：鄙人並不是反對雄聲君到農村去，而是主張事先有了計劃時再到農村去，）</p>
<p>至對尤君的見解，我雖不如劉君那樣刻毒地説「尤先生這種思想是目前中國資産階級對於現政治的一個眞切的反映」，但是尤君僅倡了到農村去的抽象原則，却無有效易行的具體計畫，這一點，殊覺美中不足，縱或有之，亦不過替雄聲君個人的小小打算，若云在本報敎育欗内所發表的敬吿全國大中學生一文裏之輪流服務農村一年的主張，現在是否可行，殊成疑問，敬敢向「學的是農，行的是農，十四年來未嘗離開一步農村的職業，親自看見過英，美，法，德，俄的農家，交際過數個外國農家子弟的同學，曾經在外國鄉村中經過幾個月的實習回國後十幾年來也曾到很多的農村，讀過很多關於中國農村的書報」的尤君前要求，請示吿訴我們一些「怎樣回到農村去」的確切而通行的詳細計劃來。那麽：支離破碎的廣大農村，十百千萬的失業同志，眞是受惠無窮了。最後；國内不乏高明之士，我希望能有關於「怎樣回到農村去」的計劃，多量地指示，更向編者先生進一言，請你把這一塊小小的園地，開放幾天，務使這個問題，獲得一個較爲圓滿的收穫，因爲它是當前的重要而又迫切的問題呀！</p>

<h3>曁南努力後追</h3>
<p>曁南見來勢甚兇、呌息暫挫其鋒、俞文彩許榮水王南珍、相繼建功、由六比三、八比五、而成八比八之平等、局面爲之一變、而韓鎭元之一球、竟使曁南超出二分、此爲曁南之全盛時代、任傑星之二中、大夏又以十四比十居前四分、尹貴仁不甘屈服、罰中一分、遠射一球、上半時結果、十四比十三、大夏勝曁南一分、</p>
<h3>形勢依舊緊張</h3>

<h3>戰局急轉直下</h3>

<h3>金融拆息又聞二分</h3>
<p>丨巿氣仍未發展丨</p>
<p>昨緣外商銀行尙未開關、以致人融巿氣猶未發展、巿塲中一叙卽散、拆息毫無軒輊、早午同爲二分、較前日略好、形勢依然鬆和、毫無發動可言、拆票交易早巿五百十餘萬、午巿四十餘萬、小總會中交易六十餘萬、錢莊對華商銀行收解各欵約五六百萬、對同業洋公單收解三千六百餘萬、各路匯欵收解六七十萬、客路來源十五萬、去胃三十萬、鈔票收回發出一百餘萬、　幣巿價江南小洋早午巿依然與前日相同、爲八百六十六元、交易早巿六千角、午巿二千角、廣東小洋早巿爲七百九十七元、午巿爲八百元、結果較前日早巿共漲六元、做出交易早巿九萬角、午巿四萬五千角、銅元加長一千文、爲三百零七千文、交易三萬八千餘串文、</p>

<h3>證劵</h3>
<p>公債虚軟不堪</p>
<p>各價又跌三四角至一元不等</p>
<p>昨華商證劵交易所、巿價變動雖不鉅、而趨勢則頗見單純、因秦皇島又宣吿失守、故巿塲人心、極爲虚弱、幸廣帮非特不賣、亦略有補進、</p>
<p>上午開盤、巿塲人氣頗形緊張、多數主張抛賣、</p>
<p>一時供求數量、頗爲懸殊、巿價自一八關起、巿形跌落數角、以後遂項均有供過於求之勢、五十</p>
<p>號售出尤湧、故入後跌勢增猛、監税跌一元左右、惟以大户仍愼重無動作、故收盤及午後雨盤、均入於恍愡之途、足見抛空者亦未敢放膽、</p>
<p>蓋以時局變化極速、屆此交割相近之期、尤多危險、觀上午收盤之略回二三角、午後兩盤之漲跌互見、可見人心忐忑、殊無確切把握也、巿價結果、跌落三四角至一元不等、戰事如不延至平津、巿價或有反動、不可不愼、成交總數、計共八百三十一萬一千元、内現貨祇一千元、期貨遠期居三之二、近期居三之一、每種成交、以统監税佔多數、共計三百二十六萬五千、裁兵佔一百十九萬、一九關佔一百零二萬五千、餘則數萬至七八十萬不等、</p>

<h3>標紗花仍帶軟勢</h3>
<p>紗巿晨跌午張、形勢略現平靜、連跌多日、</p>
<p>比高價時已跌去十元零五角、引起獲利者扖空、午後巿况稍昂、廠方在無鍚會議結果、</p>
<p>大槪亦能贊同減工、每星期兩盡夜、前途若何、</p>
<p>仍在實銷上着想云、</p>
<h3>人標又見下挫</h3>
<p>人標前巿開盤、以多頭了結、</p>
<p>巿氣紊亂、人心不佳、各月跌一元七·八角至二元、午後聞蜀帮略有交易、各月回漲九欠至一元三四角、全日成交統計六萬一百包、查賣出遠大一千三百包、明德一千四百包、賡豐一千六百五十包、長豐三千七百五十包、永昌一千七百五十包、華昌一千一百包、</p>

<p>汕頭　四四　四川　二二五　厦門　二○　同行　四七五北帮　一五　廣東　九○　　長沙　二○　内地　一三鎭江　二○　　花巿日現不穏之象、因紗巿不景氣、廠方對於高價原棉、拒絶不辦、因此各路産區現棉存貨日增、來滬套出者日衆、巿價難以支持、</p>
<p>但本埠大多頭仍拉緊不放、尙未斬結、午後有一部份云、美棉因通貨膨脹事、恐有大漲面、購進者又見活動、巿盤回上五·六角、</p>
<h3>本月花降四角</h3>
<p>鄭標前巿開盤、形勢甚衰、人心恐慌、因紗巿不振、散多斬結、近兩月破進二元關口、各月跌三·六·五角、</p>

<h3>廠需極感凋零</h3>
<p>現棉生意依然岑寂、因纱花比價相差太遠、廠方何能採辦、因之氣極其凄凉、來源計姚花六百包、</p>
<p>束溝花　四一·二五　統益廠進　二○○包　現貨送廠</p>
<h3>利物浦業週訉</h3>
<p>上週現銷平和、期貨方面、因有假期、及美國農村救濟案、非常不定、在假期前、頗有獲利了結、惟買户踴躍、堅勢頼以維持、埃及棉雖缺少買户、及營業清淡、巿况非常堅挺、</p>
<h3>糧食米巿定中帶軟</h3>
<p>（滬南）　昨來源十餘號、去胃稍有、巿况平稳、</p>
<p>惟形勢似帶軟色、包胃津帮以時局影響停辦、僅烟台帮採取、同里帮粳三百四五十包、而南洋帮汕頭客家採辦薄稻一千餘包、然形勢清淡、卒無良好氣象、致蘇同帮及青角南港等米價無軒輊、</p>
<p>杜尖洋尖未售開、杜尖定局、隂元無榮辱、變元全巿僅同里杜元一儎、價售開八元二角、</p>
<p>（滬北）　昨河下各路來源二十餘號、白粳走化本街平常、四鄉交呆、巿形疲落近尺、薄稻不多、</p>
<p>零拆不化、價小一角、早稻稍帶疲勢、秈形略軟、</p>
<p>白元挺立之格、</p>
<h3>小絞米新由漢口退回</h3>
<p>丨客秈閩化又活丨</p>
<p>昨客秈巿况、尙稱活潑、福州帮繼辦裝外、</p>
<p>泉州帮與本街亦有應酬、統巿開出四千包左右、</p>
<p>巿面似有轉機之希望、奈外埠囤户均將囤存整數搬運來申、江西米昨日亦到一批、但未出樣、</p>
<p>除客秈之外、洋米亦有退回上海、昨日漢口帮裝到小絞陳米二千包、蓋因該埠存底充足、除附近産米裝到外、湘米更多、洋米竟無去路、行情一再狂落、反比申巿爲低、遂搬回二千包、蕪湖機元亦有裝到、惟巿上存貨不多、閩帮有胃口、巿面站住、洋米由本街辦去陳小絞一千包、價七元三角、比上月底小一角半、西貢一號一百包、價仍八元、蕪湖機元由福州辦去三百包、價亦未有出入、客秈則由閩帮辦去三千包、本街去一千包、行情均與上週末無大進出、</p>
<h3>標粉後巿重入疲途</h3>
<p>昨日粉巿上午開盤後、各月份巿面、呈稱定之態、以洋麥報價、績好一三四角左右、因此巿塲人心、均見俏利、一部分之浮多、又從事收進、各月份交易、遂稍見旺、七八九月份、大致好起近分、近期好半分左右、迨至下午開盤、各月份巿况、又小見佳、以巿塲之推測、恐將來之銀價、有放長可能、洋麥前途、當少過好之象、因此大小廠方面、又陸績出檔、遠期人心、遂又受打擊、至客帮交易、又因北方戰局悲觀、亦有回出、故又呈疲軟之局、結果本月份較前日小二厘半、五月份小五厘、六月份小七厘半、七月份小二厘半、</p>
<p>八月份好二厘半、九月份小五厘、</p>
<h3>麩皮巿衰落之一斑</h3>
<p>麩皮巿面、久入平疲、因國内之銷路、漸見絶跡、良因農村之經濟破産、双兼本外埠之行家、</p>
<p>不肯放欵、所以巿面之衰落、愈趨愈甚、至廠家之存貨、大部分仍爲仇商所辦去、一小部分、則爲福建厦門汕頭所去、内地帮則音信異常沉寂、</p>
<p>至最近廠盤、已落至一兩五錢半扣盤云、</p>
<h3>車豆稍好紅糧銷活</h3>
<p>昨車豆巿形稍好、因貨主受虧太重、後手販運見呆、故來源暫時不接、執貨者勢必扳售、且牛莊大連到頭亦不湧、所以人心轉穏、昨巿售開正陽關豆五車、爲出口帮及廠家辦去、價開五元二角至五元一角、杜豆及沙黃交易略懈、而巿勢尙居平定、紅糧來源稀少、然其去路甚活潑、昨巿紹與帮亦有問津、採去高紅壳二車、價三元四角九及三元四角七、江北帮成交一車、價三元四角六、</p>
<h3>糖巿粗砂白疲定</h3>
<p>國産赤糖略佔優勢</p>
<p>昨糖巿標金旣無變更、以走銷平淡、人心趨向仍疲、二四號粗砂白公會劃盤喊二十一元二角、</p>
<p>二十號中砂白二十元零六角、咸無成交、八九號荷赤略有開出、價爲十七元至十六元九角半、國産新棉赤前昨由蘇州源生兩輪運到有千數包、</p>
<p>卽日計有潮帮開出二百餘包、價爲十六元二角半、十六元二角、十六元一角至十五元九角半、</p>
<p>走銷尙活、海南赤廣帮售出百餘包、價爲十四元六角、因存底不豐、巿亦堅挺、</p>
<h3>疋頭呢羢近狀清寂</h3>
<p>呢羢交易、公會上非常清淡、本客各帮需胃甚微、蓋門莊生意不起、巿銷頗爲呆滯、兼本月底長期角欵、以致同業中銀根暗緊、買賣雙方均欲脱貨求現、巿價因之節節下疲、現春夏各毛織品、零躉均較前爲廉、而實際上大宗成交者甚鮮、</p>
<p>統觀昨日之巿氣趨勢、大有急轉直下之勢、</p>
<h3>五金青鉛跟定價同漲</h3>
<p>青鉛巿面邇因海定價頻增、致本埠標準亦見跟高、現定價要三十八金元七角半、比前漲一金元、而申巿亦提加至十六元五角、比前加五角、交易茶帮甚竭、而油漆公司黃丹廠等點綴亦繁、出口生意天津青島烟台均受前敵戰事關係、</p>
<p>交易毫無進展、長江路及閩浙帮則微有添辦、查巿貨淺薄、到貨寥少、所以後巿標準、頗有向榮之景象、</p>
<h3>純銻現貨湧到</h3>
<p>湖南純銻、近來當地巿面平靖、出貨驟增、因此來申之現貨、爲數甚夥、查上星期到貨之多、</p>
<p>共有四五十噸之鉅、是以供過於求、巿氣萎糜、</p>
<p>標準外强中乾、計每噸售三百三十五元、比前又跌二元餘、惟零星交易、仍能勉强估三百三十六元之　、巿上買賣除搪磁廠及製造廠等微有點綴外、出口生意寥若晨星、據路透社傳述、俄國及坎拿大等處出産純銻甚多、歐美巿塲多被占住、因此華貨推銷海外者除日本外、别國已無立足之地、故欲本埠巿面之轉機、殊覺銀難、</p>
<h3>白鉛皮新貨有到</h3>
<p>白鉛皮以缺貨關係、行情陡起漲風、如二號及五號花色又爲現貨中軋缺者、故行情愈俏、其後購辦者大有無貨可得之槪、查昨新太古棧裝到四五百桶、巿塲方面、定無斷擋之憂、</p>
<h3>絲茶</h3>
<p>皖浙新茶消息</p>

<p>茶莊號、日來亦多粉粉備工、準備開塲、加以各路茶販、大肆活躍、情勢異常勢閙去、</p>
<h3>屯溪茶號減少</h3>
<p>屯溪爲皖南茶巿重要區域、去年該路茶業、大部份多受虧折、因之茶商對於本年業務、並不十分積極、現下屯埠號家、已有十餘家、决定停止進行、其餘四十八家、雖均照舊營業、但多數仍抱緊縮態度云、</p>

<h3>説春遊</h3>
<p>— 郁逹夫</p>
<p>春天的好處，在於人的不大想吃飯；春天的壞處，在於人的不大想做事。「終日昏昏醉夢間」，這便是春天的神致。醉了做夢，自然是不想吃飯，也不想做事情了，但是例外却也有，燔間乞食的齊人，就是可以破壞這定例的例外。總之春天不是讀書天，春服旣成，春情初動，踏青掃墓，還願進香，倒似乎是春天的唯一的正經。李太白的春夜宴桃李園的一序，眞正是能夠把捉住春天的心理的大傀文章，中國頽廢詩人的哲學，在此短短一序裏，也可以見一斑了。</p>
<p>但是李白，也並不是一味出賣頽廢的詩人，同時在他的建丑月十五日虎丘山夜宴序裏，他也曾説明了他的可以頽廢的原委。「方今内有夔龍臯伊，以佐百揆，外有方叔召虎，以守四方，江海之人，高枕無事，則琴壺以宴友朋，嘯歌以展霞月，吾黨之職也······」回頭來一看我們中國目下的現狀，却是如何？但遠火似乎終於燒不着近水，華北的烽烟，當然是與我們無關，所以滬杭路局，儘可以開遊春的特别專車，電影皇后，也可以張永夜的舞塲清宴。</p>
<p>説到遊，原並不是壞事。禮記目令篇説：「仲夏之月，可以遠眺望，可以升山陵」。况且孔子北遊，喟然而嘆，迫二三子之各言其志。太史公遊覧名山大川，而文章以著。德國中世，子弟之修了修業年期者，必使之出遊，以廣見聞，所以於修業年限ＬＧＨＲＪＡＨＲＥ之後，必有遊歷年限ＷＡＮＤＥＲＪＡＨＲＥ的規定。像這一種遊歷，是有所得的遠遊，是點綴太平的人事，原也未可厚非。不過中國到了目下的這一個現狀，餓骨滿郊而烽烟遍地，有閑有産的階級，該不該這麽的浪費，倒還是一個問題。</p>
<p>雖然，遊春可以不忘救國，救國也可以不忘遊春，但這句話是眞的麽？</p>
<h3>論大澤鄕</h3>
<p>— 曹聚仁</p>
<p>大澤鄕，豹子頭林冲和石碣三個短篇小説，茅盾先生以「舊瓶裝新酒」的方式寫成的。我覺得石碣比較寫得成功些，茅盾先生自已覺得大澤鄕「顯得親切」些。（見我的回顧頁八）大澤鄕，原是好題材，可是茅盾先生的觀察不十分正確；我以爲不應該那麽寫。</p>
<p>楚漢之際那些人物，可以分成三羣：</p>
<p>范增，陸賈，宋義，張良，蕭何，這是一羣，代表士大夫階級；他們的政策是『不如有所屬，事成猶得封侯，事敗易以亡，非世所指名也』。他們有一共同方針，立諸侯後以相號召。田巿，田安，田榮，韓廣，趙王歇，楚王心，這又是一羣，代表破落户；他們依附士大夫夢想復國運動。項籍，項梁，劉季，陳勝，吳廣，韓信，彭越這又是一羣，代表流氓階級；他們是那個時代的中心人物，各抱「彼可取而代也」的雄心。環繞這三羣人物的周圍，有千千萬萬的農民，怨憤鬱積，一觸即發。流氓階級就利用這鬱積的心理，趁個機會發動起來。</p>
<p>大澤鄕所以是好題材，就因爲牠能代表數千年來農民革命的方式。</p>
<p>大澤鄕的發動，並不是突然的，事前有相當的計劃。陳涉是一個有野心的人，他在家鄕耕田時，就在那裏「苟富貴，無相忘」地發預約券。大澤鄕的霖雨，他知道他的機會到了，「詐稱公子扶蘇項羽爲天下唱」，「丹書帛置人所　魚腹中」，「夜篝火，狐嗚呼」，這都是陰謀家的權術，决非閭左貧農的意識。茅盾先生似乎把這一點丢開。把陳涉當作，一般農民看待，因此把重心移到那兩個醉酒軍官身上去，影子因而很淡了。</p>
<p>寫歷史小説，儘可以灌注新意義；但和歷史的事實，不能太背違。大澤鄕的農民革命，包含兩種意識：一種是貧農對於貴族的反抗，一種是楚民族對於秦民族的反抗。我們且看那時的士大夫階級，無不以立楚後爲言，這種民族意識，對於當時農民確具有號召的力量。直到劉季項羽以流氓階級居中心，民族抗爭情緖才降落下去。寫大澤鄕，若不把這兩種意識錯從寫成，如茅盾先生之專寫一種意識，會把事實的眞相抺殺的。中國的農民革命運動，在農民方面常是不意識的，所以常常被别人拿去利用。史記陳涉世家明明説：『卒中往往語，皆指目陳勝。吳廣素愛人，士卒多爲之用者』。這是利用農民成功的明證。茅盾先生却説：『然而僅僅是詫異罷了。</p>
<p>没有幻想。奉一個什麽人爲「王」那樣事的味兒，他們早已嘗得夠了。一切他們的期望是掙斷身上的繚索。』這决不是中國的農民，更不是那時的中國農民；這樣一寫，把流氓階級與農民之間的連銷割斷了。</p>
<p>還有許多零零星星的意見，我不寫下去了；我現在想再用舊瓶裝一回新酒看。</p>
<h3>「我們可以等候五十年」</h3>
<p>— 楊幸之</p>
<p>不久以前，「高等華人」胡適之博士曾在獨立評論上著文，主張和日本開始直接交涉，除了「某種條件」以外，交涉的目標應該是：「取銷滿洲僞國，恢復中國在東三省與熱河的領土及行政主權。」但爲什麽該以此爲目標呢？「其理由也很簡單，」卽『第一，我們要對住國聯和美國的「不承認主義，」第二，我們不應該抛棄國聯』。</p>
<p>博士這樣的主張當然是聰明的。第一，他只用「直接交涉」四個字便可以把反抗日本帝國主義者的民族革命戰爭消滅個乾凈；第二，他只用「某種條件」四個字便可以把整個中華民族當作猪玀般去拍賣；第三，他再巧妙地拿着「要對住國聯和美國」做「交涉的目標，應該是取銷滿洲僞國，恢復中國在東三省與熱河的領土，</p>
<p>及行政主權」的註脚，這卽是説，我們亡國不要緊，但我們必須對得住我們的主子，因爲主子并没有呌我們承認滿洲國，而且我們要仰仗主子的地方正多着，决不能脱離主子的懷抱，</p>
<p>這樣，又可使我們這一羣「高等華人」以下的華人都明白「主子第一，民族爲輕」的道理，從此都會俯首恬耳，靜聽主子的吩咐，靜候主子的宰割。呵，我們該感謝博士的昭示，該感謝博士的打算。</p>
<p>然而這聰明的打算現在竟然失敗了，憑着「實騐主義，」實騐這打算已經失敗了，一則因爲「下等華人」究竟也還敢於不容許政府當局作今日的李鴻章，再則據駐華日公使有吉説：「現在日本旣已退出國聯，如果中日直接交涉，</p>
<p>是無形中提高了中國的國際地位，」顯然「不屑」和中國直接交涉。這樣，我們的博士的聰明打算便失敗了。</p>
<p>失敗了，算什麽，再來一個，總之我們决不容有抗日的民族革命戰爭，日本旣不許我們交涉，我們便該「等死，」於是我們的博士又在第四十四期獨立評論上高呌「我們可以等候五十年！」</p>
<p>「等候五十年」的意義是什麽？第一，當然還是不准動，不准反抗；第二，是只准看着滿洲國成立，不准「收回；」第三，是日本人要什麽便讓他拿什麽，五十年，丨也許是無窮年之内，我們不准動，做奴隸便該做一輩子的奴隸。</p>
<p>因爲「現在全世界的正誼的贊助是在我們的方面，全世界的道德的貶議是在我們的敵人的頭上，」這就是説，主子們現在也不很滿意日本的「獨佔」滿洲，同時很滿意我們能願受宰割，一點也没有抵抗。所以，「我們的最後勝利是絲毫無可疑的。」最後勝利，可，我們只要衆存了這一點「信心，」不是什麽都不在乎嗎？五十年算什麽？我們做奴隸的日子正長着呵！</p>
<p>何家幹先生詩曰：「能言鸚鵡毒如蛇，」我則以爲我們的「鸚鵡」是「聰明」的，因爲他會把「長期抵抗」做一個更聰明的註脚，他會製出更好的定心丸，他會製出更巧妙的烟幕彈，呵，我們的鸚鵡，我們的博士，我們的高等華人！</p>
<p>然而，聽説最近松岡洋右由日内瓦轉赴華盛頓，是爲游説美國置中國於共管，於是美前副國務卿凱塞爾便屬上爲史汀生主義做新的註解，美前商務部遠東司長艾德烈更公然主張東三省可交由日本治理。這樣看來，主子們也似乎變了心了，似乎在打算和日本和平分贓了，我們又該怎樣呢？呵，我們的博士，我們的活寳貝。</p>
<h3>回家途中（續）</h3>
<p>— 六曾</p>
<p>明晰地刻劃在薄壘的畫底上的，多年不見的龍華塔，這時在我的眼中現得非常秀美。三年前，一個同樣飄着微雨的春天的午後，獨游比利時京城近郊勒康公園（ＰＡＲＣ　ＤＥ　ＬＡＥＫＥＮ）時、覺得建在那裏的一座日本塔，也還别緻，徘徊賞玩久之。現在對着這俊俏的龍華塔，回憶中的日本塔，似乎有些矮笨難看了。</p>
<p>清明剛剛過去，路旁許多墳墓已有人加了幾撮新土。以前這類東西是不會引起我的注意的；就是注意到了，也會跟着發生一些厭惡之感的。而今不然，因爲自已最愛的人也踏進這世界裏去了，便連不相干的别人家的土饅頭也和自已有了什麽關係似的，帶着一種好意的親切的眼光瞻顧着。</p>
<p>汽車穿過一道小溪。沿溪兩行桃柳，不多幾天以前，還不過在枝頭綴着一些青色的嫩芽而已，現在却是花花綠綠的，披着嬌艶的春裝。幾株長得快的柳樹，竟已有着婀娜的長條臨風搖拽了。</p>
<p>車子離開都會愈遠，田疇和菜畦裏送來的桃柳愈多。有時還可見到幾十株或幾百株行列整然的桃圃，但那密密層層盛開着的花朶，紅得那樣粗俗，看着實在使人不快，倒不如單是長着綠葉的柳樹，顯得素凈可愛。</p>
<p>説到柳樹，這實在是一種最富於詩情畫意的植物。在歐洲，雖不常看到柳樹，但西文中的ＳＡＵＩＥ和ＷＩＬＬＯＷ却同中文裏面的「楊柳」一樣，常常見諸吟咏的。妻在的時候，最愛誦繆塞（ＭＵＳＳＥＴ）的名作：</p>
<p>親愛的朋友們啊，當我死了以後，</p>
<p>請你們種一株柳樹在我的墳頭。</p>
<p>我愛它那涙人兒似的繁條密葉，</p>
<p>那蒼白的顔色使我覺得親愛而又温柔。</p>
<p>它還會有輕飄飄的陰影</p>
<p>蔭覆着我所長眠的荒丘。</p>
<p>如今柳色青青，人已長往，獨個兒在車中憶起繆塞的詩句，不就像妻自已在説着的話一樣嗎？前塵如夢，能不泫然！</p>
<p>車裏面不知什麽時候上來了兩個外國青年，清癯的面貎，高大的身材，看去像是英國人。這巿上的公共汽車，一年裏面也難載到幾個外國人的，這兩個白種人的出現，頗引起車裏面許多小商人和小地主的驚異，大家目不轉睛的釘着他們，喞喞噥噥地議論着。（未完）</p>

<h3>時代與愛的歧路</h3>
<p>— 張資平</p>
<p>他决意到李一香陳華民所組織的出版社去看看那些文友，並探聽一下今天下午被捕的同志們的消息。那個出版社設於日本帝國主義勢力圏内的虹口那頭。由這邊到那頭去，至少需一個多鐘頭。但是在今晚上無路可走了的海泉，唯有决意到他們那裏把今晚上混過去。</p>
<p>到了他們的出版社，已經八鐘半鐘了。出版社的夥伴們大部分出外面頑去了。只有兩三個比較不重要的職員還留在那裏看書或塗塗寫寫。海泉來過幾次，認識了他們，忙向他們打招呼。但他們都是冷冷的，不甚理會海泉。海泉問他們，李一香先生住在什麽地方，他們都説不知道。再向他們今晚上李先生來不來這裏，他們也没有確切的回答。海泉覺得無聊，只在書報室裏翻了翻報，再看看他們所出版的社會科學書籍。他看到九點半鐘了，正打算回曹世光家裏去，這時候忽然聽見外面廊下有一陣的脚步聲。</p>
<p>「怕他們要來搜查呢，放老成一點的好。」</p>
<p>「没有什麽問題吧。」</p>
<p>海泉聽得明白這是陳華民先生的聲音。</p>
<p>「怕什麽？怕什麽？那有這樣野蠻的辦法！」</p>
<p>這趟是李一香先生的聲音。</p>
<p>「但是帝國主義者是不講道理的。」</p>
<p>「我們這社裏本來就没有什麽，讓他們來檢查好了！不至於就發封吧。無論怎樣，也不至於野蠻到這個程度。」</p>
<p>海泉走出來看，在陳李兩先生後面還跟隨着四五個二三流的作家。海泉聽見了這班成名了的作者不禁羡慕起來。他們都在客堂裏坐下來了。海泉便也走進來，先呌了李一香一聲，然後又向着陳華民點了點頭，也稱了一聲陳先生。</p>
<p>「啊，你來了。」</p>
<p>李一香看見海泉，似乎表示出意外的神氣。</p>
<p>「李先生，你以後怎樣逃了回來的？」</p>
<p>海泉笑着問他。</p>
<p>「笑話！爲什麽要逃？那些巡捕敢亂捉人的麽？」</p>

<h3>裸舞</h3>
<p>— 天方</p>
<p>向來看報有一種偏好，就是在未看新聞之前，喜先讀廣吿。第一當然是想看看有無新書出版，其次就想知道一點公開駡人的方式，丨如你説我受賄，我指你攀誣之類，或者揭發他人一點隠私，以爲自已貨眞價實的旁證。因爲曾經出了錢，所以説話就自由痛快得多，比訪員所報吿的新聞，還來得眞情流露，</p>
<p>這是我喜看廣吿的理由。</p>
<p>近來這偏好似乎更甚，原因也很簡單，滿紙的「救國」「决議」「通電」「新陳線」，把我看得已有點膩煩了，雖然有某將軍詔我們「内憂外患，均不足懼」，</p>
<p>但此心終還頗爲不安，大槪是「已死」之證。</p>
<p>昨天照例的把新聞紙一張一張地翻看一下，在「訂婚」「報喪」與「辨誣」的廣吿中，却發現了如下一條廣吿，爰照錄如下，以供衆覽：</p>
<p>本院自開映ＸＸＸ及法國裸體舞時，因觀衆擁擠，無法全數容納，因而被　　阻於外者，每塲不下千餘人，本院對之，殊覺萬分抱歉，愛觀者，務請早　　臨，以免向隅。</p>
<p>這雖是一個廣吿，目的或重在於「早臨」，但觀衆的擁擠，至少有一半是事實。因爲自「藝術叛徒」劉，與「五省聯軍總司令」孫，辦理裸體交涉以來，此風大盛。一般人的目光，因不在於藝術的美不美，只求乎「玉體」的裸一裸，這也許是「狗抓地毯」的表現。至於「跳舞」，則更非「裸」不行，何况所「裸」的是「貌美年輕」的「法國女子」呢，其受人歡迎·自不待言，丨蓋其中尙含有尊重舶來品的意味存乎其間也。</p>
<p>所可「抱歉」的是那每塲「不下千餘」被阻於塲外的「觀衆」，矯首塲外，欲一親「色相」而不得的那種情形。見了眞可憐，固不獨使戲院老闆「抱歉」，即讀報者也代爲不平。於此不得不感「犠牲色相」的宏願，尙受物質的限制，這是負有宣傅「美感藝化」的戲院老闆們所應改進的。好在現今歌舞團之多，眞不下於「雨後的香菇」，而且全都是「貌美年輕」，又雖非「法國」，頗多「洋來」，而又盡肯「犠牲色相」。「肥臀顫動，變化無窮，能銷柳惠之魂：曲線微呈，已足醉魯男之魄。觀其身，則使人目迷神眩，心蕩意消；近其旁，似麝馥蘭芳，更使人筋酥骨軟······」（原文見某戲院廣吿，圏點作者所加），即看此廣吿·已足使人「飄飄然」，「滿意」大致相同。「貌美年輕」的女子自不乏，祇須發下宏願，便誰都可裸，一樣受人歡迎，所以供應上尙不致大起恐慌，這是差可吿慰的。臨了，順便在此替各大戲院代登一個義務廣吿，我用名譽保證，這確是在帝國主義重重壓迫下的半殖民地的人們的唯一麻醉劑。倘使你已寫下了「永不反抗」的「服辯」，那很值得化幾毛大洋，「早臨」一回丨遲則「向隅」丨以便洩洩肚裹的鳥氣。</p>
<p>亂曰丨國事如此其渾渾兮，我何獨不尋乎開心：</p>
<p>彼大砲之隆隆兮，又何如披霞娜之可聽；</p>
<p>夏禹之旣逝兮，裸國其猶可尋；</p>
<p>願「色相」之常親兮，又何必厚古而薄今丨</p>

<h3>遊西湖去？</h3>
<p>— 匡貝</p>
<p>時候已是暮春三月了，從蒸氣管室内跳出來的哥兒小姐，又要試一試一九三三年的春裝，踱向野外去賞識風光了，生活永遠是這麽諧和，新鮮活潑，可愛，却説江南春色，已是分外的惹人眷戀，「春草碧色，春水綠波，」是前人的風雅名句，還有「暮春三月，江南草長，雑花生樹，羣鶯亂飛，」更是繪聲繪色的描摹·是的呀，「對酒當歌，人生幾何，」還不及時的痛快玩麽？古人更有過「秉燭夜遊」的韻事，難道我們竟連白日都任憑枉過？</p>
<p>聽説連旬以來，正盛行着「遊西湖狂」，在江南的春天，西湖果然是獨步的明媚了浪跡海上已有整五年了的我如耳濡目染，厄也久已在我的腦中鐫下了深刻的印象，使我常時憧憬着的，是那湖濱的一座墳塋丨斷鴻零雁記作者曼殊大師，但我迄今還不曾親身去過。</p>
<p>這番，今年·Ｘ君在半月以前便向路局去設法車票，我也曾冒失的允充陪客，時光像梭一般的疾駛，昨夜Ｘ君來吿訴我，票已弄到，準十七早去，問我籌好了幾元零用錢没有，我忽如酣夢大醒，破口説不去了，這眞有負Ｘ君的盛意·是撈不到幾元零用錢麽？那倒並不是的！時候已是暮春了，天氣轉暖，儘可捲起床上的被褥送進長生庫，即使換不得五塊十塊，當得上三塊也就夠用了，這樣，不像去求情他人，碰你一鼻子的灰，「困難，困難，目下實在困難，若是再等住幾天，或者還可拿得出。」的大套擋駕語·</p>
<p>到底爲什麽不去？我只覺得在這前方鼙鼓陣地來，個人也是如此窘厄的時候，眞不應有這種閒情逸致，雖不學古人「臥薪嘗膽，」也該稍稍嚴肅一些·在這時代裏，「閒情逸致，」只有ＸＸ將軍之流，踐外使之約，到郊野去打獵，小子何容瞻望，</p>
<p>然而夜來我又做着西湖之夢，但我只是站立在湖邊的堤上，張目疾視，却不曾把脚跟移動半步，在我眼底盪漾過的：旣不是西子湖的美麗，也不是春光的明媚，更不是草木的葱籠，花卉的香妍，掠水的燕語鶯囀，而是子規在啼血，山洪在暴嘯，在湖心與山坡蠕動着的一羣羣，我看得鮮明，是殭屍，於是我哭了，哭的也不是我的脚不能動彈，是我的嘴不能張喊，只在喉管裹咭咕着，喚不應那些在狂遊的人羣，即算不知亡國恨，也應遙聆遙聆口外的砲聲，看是向塞外逸去？還是向關内衝來？我急得慌了，跟前忽射出了一個瘦長的影子，有人在我的肩脖上拍着：「你這小子，怎的這般痴心？現在不是歌舞昇平的世界麽，除了口外在嚮着重砲·呐喊·儘管呐喊，究竟有什麽用處？要知口外的砲聲，是嚮不透國人的耳膜，除非大難臨到了他們的家巢，看如何，小夥子，我挈你去一同陶醉沉淪吧·别再在這兒痴心！」「謝謝你！我的脚不能動彈，你儘管去吧！」我回答之後，依舊張目疾視，疾視那蜂羣似的殭屍·忽然「炸」的一重嚮，好像就落在西湖的中心，湖水四方飛濺·狂遊的人們也就全都結果了·我猛的驚醒了，張開兩眼，室内已跳躍着稀疏的太陽·我便迅速的披上外衣，下床開始着生活的忙碌。</p>

<p>該項電文大約是説：因爲該椄林塲林警隊代理隊長張某私撤林警五人，該林塲敎授兼主任侯過以隊長無辜私撤林警屬其將已撤林警復職。於是，而有鄒校長之姪，林警隊隊長鄒禮炳者，糾集校長衛隊十餘人，直趨林塲，以手槍向侯主任及林塲職員黃，頼，二君，指胸恐嚇旋將侯主任拘禁校長室，更誣黃，賴二君爲共黨，兇毆重傷，復以鐵索大鎖，繫於校警室，事務長鄒就丞則故意縱惡養奸，經員生簽押苦求，始將兩人釋出就醫，云云···」</p>
<p>閙得昏天黑地。小子無知，以爲大學堂忽然變成了司令部或拘禁所之類的機關。虧得有全校員生爲之簽押苦求，否則侯敎授以及黃，頼二君之性命亦交關危險了！然而，彼黃，頼二君已經是兇毆重傷，而且繫過鐵索大鎖，侯敎授也被禁於校長室，可謂飽嘗大學堂裏的鐵窗風味了！</p>
<p>幸而小子家貧，無力進大學，否則也要惶惶然非恐入於縲絏之中而爲校警室内的俘虜，而要在那里喊着：「······</p>
<p>爲四千餘員生求保障，爲保神聖學府尊嚴，爲求人權之伸張，······」而在那里忍痛犠牲，敬祈全國文化團體來主持正義，予以同情與援助了！非但讀書不成，而且要惶惶然爲人權之伸張以向外界呼籲求援、這正是在那里作孽了！</p>
<p>倘然，果眞到了在校長衛隊槍口之下，呼籲無門，那末不是去做「學生」，</p>
<p>而是去「學死」了丨烏乎！</p>

<h3>潑水可收</h3>
<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>我是一個某大商店裏的小職員，今年二十二歲，每月的收入尙豐，現在我有一件極難解决的問題：就是我在十七歲那年，家中替我訂了一們親事；當時我年紀尙輕，所以對於這件事，未置可否。對方今年也十八歲了，所以本想於今冬結婚。去年對方尙在校中求學，竟被某男同學所誘惑；於去年年底，相約潛逃。並來函要求對方父親，向我家提出解約的要求；我父當然同意，婚約因之解除。現在因爲某男同學的家屬，不容該女，乃仍返母家。此後有許多人來説·「他以前品行極好·人亦聰頴，不過一時受人蠱惑，現在已經完全悔改，</p>
<p>頗望我家能原諒她，重聯秦晉之好」。她的學問人品，確是很好。她已經完全悔改，在我個人以爲重踐舊約，也是無妨。但是家裏的人，却絶對反對，説怎麽「名譽攸關」等話。我與她萬一眞的結婚，對於我的名譽，到底有没有關係呢？請你給我一個回音。（下略）</p>
<p>王雲來謹上</p>
<p>Ｘ　　　Ｘ　　　Ｘ　　　Ｘ</p>
<p>編者按：王君的對方，是否眞能悔改，這不能全憑他人的傅説；必須自已去細細考察才行。要是她的眞悔改了，那你就與她結婚，也是無防。要是她的悔改，不過是出於不得已而爲之，那没日後的結果，就可怕了。至於名譽一層，因爲現社會裏，頑固的人尙多，所以難免不受其影響。不過這是他們觀念的錯誤，你可以不顧的呢！</p>
<p>末了我們以爲一個女子，社交當然可以公開，但是隨隨便便的失身於人，實在應當要避免的。因爲一失足後，即使愧悔，呌誰能一時可以原諒你呢？</p>

<h3>夢裏光陰（三十一續）</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>學生，一個個的給鈴聲驚動了，紛紛都擁到了大禮堂上來：伍逸也在人叢中穿過，合着敎務主任，訓育主任，文學院長，······幾個重要的敎授，一同坐到了指導席上去。</p>
<p>其時，中央的一座大講台上，已有兩個態度很激烈的學生，像解差似的押着一個服很精美，臉色慘白，垂頭喪氣的青的年，在一排圏椅的後面站着。</p>
<p>「啊！是他嗎？他果然做了這樣没廉恥的勾當了！」伍逸的右邊，坐着以前他在美國的老同學，去年才由他自動做主聘任的商學院院長周錫琛。周錫琛認得台上被看守着的那一個所謂「破壞全體名譽，阻撓檢貨運動的敗類」，正是他們商學院銀行系中一位最善胡調的學生，便帶着一種「我早知他靠不住矣」</p>
<p>的口氣，這樣感慨着。</p>
<p>「他呌什麽名字？」伍逸並不十分注意地問着。</p>
<p>他呌他呌王國棟吧，周錫琛的答復。</p>
<p>「啊！王國棟」！伍逸的神氣突然變了，身子一挺，便打座位上跳了起來，</p>
<p>把一雙近視眼睜得比往常大了一培，兩臂交义在胸前，像一個拳鬥家一般的直立着，其時，學生會的一班委員和幹事，全到了，逐一走上了大講台去，分兩邊坐在主席位上；這十多個人在伍逸的發了花的眸子裏看來，已變爲十來個姿態各别的毛菊芬女士了；有的是在向他微笑，有的是在發愁，有的是在摟着一個小孩子喂乳，······總之，此刻他底腦神筋上，已充滿着毛女士昔年的音容笑貌了！</p>
<p>他記得三年之前，自已還在當傀儡的時代，王玉麟曾經寫過一封信給他，</p>
<p>大意是説：「小犬玉麟，學名國棟，早年喪母，（毛女士在伍逸上南京來的第二年上就死了）乏人敎導，性殊頑劣，現已考入貴校商學院，務乞隨時照料。</p>
<p>······」不過，那時候，伍逸不但大權旁落，無力照料，而且整天喝得胡天胡帝，那裏還把這事放在心上。相不到今天竟是狹路相逢了！怎敎他不驚慌失措呢？</p>
<p>他還記得小麟長到四周歲，已經能夠一個人獨來獨去的時候，菊芬因爲太愛他的緣故，總是當他像一兩歲的小孩子一般的抱持着，熱天累得混身是汗！</p>
<p>也不怨；有一次，她且曾極鄭重地叮嚀伍逸道：「你必須誠心愛護我的小麟，</p>
<p>譬如你的兒子跟小麟在同一個時候落水，你必須先救小麟，然後再救你的兒子，這樣才是我的好朋友」！當時，伍逸也給了她一個滿意的答復，他説：「我一定像你一般的愛他」！</p>
<p>現在菊芬雖死了，這幾句話却還在他耳朶邊響着，然而在這樣的情形之下，他究能怎樣偏護他底「情人的兒子」呢。</p>

<h3>我們意識堅强的作品在那裏？</h3>
<p>— 錢台生</p>
<p>不容諱言，一九三三年這年頭，也許是我們消沉昏迷的電影界，轉變蘇醒的年頭。最近各公司的作品，由最近公映的「女性的呐喊」起，直到將近公映的「生機，」和以前公映的「三個摩登女性」「城市之夜」「都會的早晨」「狂流」等等作品看，我們可以發見牠們已站在一致的，</p>
<p>陣線上攝製比較有生命的作品。</p>
<p>那是無疑的，他們是想抓緊了這動，活躍的時代，對所謂資本主義的社會，加以痛烈的拌擊，想以同一樣的題材，闡明農工新生命的意義！然而以所有作品作一個嚴密的分析着，</p>
<p>我們不能不承認，它們僅有一部份的成功。</p>
<p>在「女性的呐喊」裏，導演顯然没有抓緊了全劇主要的部分，所以全劇不免籠罩了朦朧的輕紗，在全劇鬆懈的部份上，放過了全劇最緊張的完成。在「生機」裏據説也有很多介紹女工生活的塲面，在没有公映以前，我們不想説什麽話。</p>
<p>在「三個摩登女性」裏面，它吿訴我們最「摩登」的女性，便是前進革命的女性，而由畫面上所介紹的，有一張工人碼頭的畫片，説這是工人生活的苦惱吓！在結束的一塲，意識尤其不健全的，它寫出這年青的公子少爺能放棄他恣意享樂的生活，跟着他心愛的女工離開都市，雖然它要表明公子哥兒的覺醒，而實際祇寫出了年青的公子，爲這美麗的女工而傾倒瘋狂了，他所以離開他平日資産階級享樂的生活，不是什麽革命，不是什麽光明，而僅僅是爲一個女人而迷戀。</p>
<p>「城市之夜」和「都會的早晨」吿訴我們什麽呢？一個結束的口號是：「大家回農村去！」一個的結果是寫出「到光明的地方去！」但是農村在那裏？什麽地方是我們「光明的地方？」什麽地方是一般苦勞農工階級，不受擠壓剝削的地方？「桃花源」「世外天地」究竟和這「農村」或「光明的地方」是同一樣的幻想吓。</p>
<p>「狂流」所寫出的，一張農村搆成罪惡的暴露，和大水災的釀成，它寫出農村中暴戾險許的紳士，它寫出大水災的肇成誰是其中禍首。但牠所寫出的禍首，是否是眞禍首，或僅是環境造成的罪人，而當不起禍首的罪名</p>
<p>以上所寫到的這幾張作品，他們新的題材的引用，不能不使我們感到同情，但在演出的結果上，把描寫工人農村的正面介紹印都忽略了，成了一張意識模糊的作品，的確是我們九三三年新興電影界最可惋惜的事實。</p>
<p>但在攝製公司方面，據我們所知道的，「三個麽登女性」曾有電話女工大罷工的一塲；「狂流」結果本來農民暴動的一塲，都是被删去了的。公司方面恐怕觸當局的忌諱，便不得向溫和這一方走；但因爲引用新的題材和意識，又不得不攝製較新的作品，結果就是這種矛盾的表現使人發生不痛不癢之感。</p>
<p>在這擠壓的環境裏，在這酸苦的時代裏，我們什麽時候，可以看到一張意識堅强作品呢</p>
<p>觀衆意見</p>
<h3>觀「羅宫春色」後所感</h3>
<p>— 嘉南</p>
<p>屈服在鐵蹄下的羣衆，决不會終是　户埋首，吞泣飲聲，他們潛伏着的力。一得了相當的時機，就像火山的爆發出來，向他們的對象，進攻，爭扎，去求他們的「生路」，那時他們的領袖·都具有精誠，相反，犧牲等偉大的精神·這片裏的忒士斯，法維絲和看護婦密茜亞等都是很好的榜樣，尤以密茜亞能犧牲愛情，富貴，不和殘酷的君主妥恊，而和一班同志和她始終信仰的宗敎殉死爲難能可貴，惟有這樣偉大的精神，方能感化了喧赫一時的地方官馬柯，擯棄了他的幸運來加入她們的戰線。</p>
<p>一切政案，最後的决定，操縱於無知的婦人手裏。這種　頇的現象不能專責君主時代的執政者，而是古今中外一般統治者的縮影。至於同類相殘，人獸惡鬭的怪現象，尤其是現在一般帝國主義所播弄於不知自救的弱小民族一貫政策丨乖覺的西席地密耳，他不願把他們丨統治者以後怎樣崩落結果，率直的演出來，恐怕是備他們自已去感觸，和想像的。</p>
<p>全劇的緊張，和導演的技巧，以及演員，佈景，攝影等，都早在本刊有人評過，這裏不必再寫。總之，這片並不是像廣告上奉諭不准十七歲兒童參觀這樣神秘，也不僅像片名上所告訴我們的這樣肉感。而是比「賓漢」「十誡」「萬王之王」還偉大還有意義的一張鉅片。</p>
<p>「慾」的一幕蕭伐洛夫對吉普西少女説：</p>
<p>「你是妲拉喀挪華公主」</p>
<h3>看了「女性的呐喊」之後</h3>
<p>— 李瓊</p>
<p>關於「女性的呐喊」，很顯然的是以婦女解放爲主題。所以我們女性的確値得關心。當我看完本片走出中央大戲院的時候，我覺得編劇者對於我們小資産階級女性在目前中國所處的地位，確是十分明瞭的。但是我們並不因此滿足；爲什麽呢？因爲事實上中國婦女已在大　「呐喊」，决不是像本片所説的現在才是「呐喊」的時候。何况本片還没有「呐喊」出來。換句話説：便是製片者對於出路的指示，是那樣空洞而且含混。一個革命的女性少英，在劇中應該是一個主要的人物，但是導演祇將她在字幕上説了幾句，當然這是非常不夠的。女主角葉蓮，當她經過幾次剌激而决心和惡勢力努力奮鬭的時候，那末她一定是一個堅强而勇敢於反抗的典型女性了，可是在劇中所表現出來的，却是一個可恥的十分怯弱的少女，最多不過是不甘人格墜落而已。同時，這種唯心的貞操觀念，是否比其他更加主要的問題還要重大的呢？其次在本片的末尾，導演很認眞的攝取外灘的和平神像，這眞是百思不得其解，是否説祇須葉蓮覺悟之後，馬上便是世界和平呢？果如此，將使我們懐疑到導演過於神經質了。</p>
<p>然而整個的説來，這「女性的呐喊」，畢竟是把握了時代性的新作品，所以我們對於本片的製作者，仍懐着重大的希望。</p>
<h3>「女性的呐喊」喊在那裏</h3>
<p>— 希宗</p>
<p>這「女性的呐喊」的意識不能説是歪曲；但在演出的技巧和結構上可是失敗了！一面固然是編劇者缺少現實生活的體騐，同時，經騐確是一個極大的原因。這種「女性的呐喊」，喉嚨呐喊到唖，也絶不會喊醒沉睡中的二萬萬的女同胞！眞的，與其説是「女性的呐喊」，不如説「女性的壓迫」來得恰當。</p>
<p>在銀幕上所展開的景面：並没有表現出怎樣的［呐喊］，也没有指示出光明的前路。這裏的女主人丨葉蓮，踏入了社會，所就到的是痛苦和壓迫，絶不能稱到「呐喊」，「呐喊」根本没有成立。</p>
<p>這裏也有一些矛盾和錯誤：如王大媽到刦後的葉蓮家裏偷了一個鐲子；但這鐲子絶不會放在一只别無零物的廚的抽斗裏，因强盜的闖入，翻箱倒篋，鐲子不會不被刦去的。這是一些矛盾；葉蓮的妹子被騙後，關在房裏，但她的頭髮一忽兒烫的，一忽兒童化，這是一些錯誤。</p>
<h3>敎育部籌設電影局</h3>
<p>— 趙匡胤</p>
<p>敎部最近接受褚民誼陳果夫建議，請設立電影局，以期澈底改進中國電影事業，敎部迭經討論後，决將原有敎内兩部之電影檢查委會合併改組，成立全國電影局，已交秘書處起草規程，其將來工作，分爲（一）編製關係發揚民族描寫民間疾苦電影劇本，供給全國影片公司採用，（二）攝製關於發揚民族精神描寫民間之影片，供給全國各影戲院租購，</p>
<p>（三）攝製關於國家事業各項影片，放送各國云。</p>
<p>這「女性的呐喊」整個的説起來不如「狂流」和「自由之花」。</p>
<h3>銀花片片</h3>
<p>— 菁主</p>
<p>胡萍編劇兼主演的「姊姊的生路」，由明星公司當局指定王吉亭，譚志遠担任該劇的導演。已於前天開始工作，拍了千餘尺的外景。</p>
<p>宣景琳進了明星公司後的「前程」，由張石川領導，於今天拍完最後一個塲面，是個富家的景。這部片大槪在下月便可和滬上人士相見了。</p>
<p>胡蝶主演，張石川導演的「脂粉市埸」，已由南京電影檢查會檢查通過，不日卽將公眏於卡爾登大戲院。</p>
<p>聯華一廠的「母性之光」由金𦦨，魯史，陳燕燕，黎灼灼合演，卜萬蒼導演。現已工作及半，日來在趕製一個偉大的塲面！一個大型音樂會。</p>
<p>阮玲玉主演孫瑜導演的「不玩意」，前天拍完全部的戰景後，昨天則在攝製一個宏　的無廳。據説這部戲將於下月完成。</p>
<p>天一公司女童星袁美雲的新戲，已定「孝道」。歸湯曉舟導演。現在籌備中，不日卽將開拍了。</p>
<p>蔡楚生繼「都會的早晨」的作品，已定名爲「漁光曲」·以漁民生活作背景，劇本由蔡自已創作，卽將於不月底開始工作云。</p>
<h3>電影小説慾　Ｔａｒａｋａｎｏｖａ　（七）</h3>
<p>— 梅花</p>
<p>奥洛夫，在把妲拉喀娜華送進了修道院以後，他的靈魂仍是不斷地追隨着，他總覺得把她，去到修道院裏，這顆心總放不下的。他幾次瞞着人，到修道院裏去見妲拉喀娜華，然而這個精神上和肉體上同有着創痕的少女，她是不能再見他的了！他屢次被拒絶，他對着這個院宇深深的修道院嘆着一口長氣，垂着頭，一步一步地挨着，冥想着躺在裏面的妲拉喀娜華公主，不知道她這時還是嘆息，或是怨恨。</p>
<p>其實妲拉喀挪華是不會怨恨的，非但不怨恨而且還死心塌地的愛他！當她一個人躺在床上的時候，聴着敎堂的鐘聲，她會冥想到在意在利海岸上那座行宫！她會想着奥洛夫請她上兵艦的時候，那些歡呼的景象，是的，一切的一切，現在都還湧現在眼前，只是奥洛夫呢？</p>
<p>「呀，我的愛，你到底來不來呀。她有氣無力地這樣呻吟着；有時聽見院宇裏小鳥吱喳的吱喳的呌，她疑心是奥洛夫的聲音有時，門兒呀的一下，她又揣想到是奥洛夫的脚步；她的眼眶已經深深，地陷了進去，她的兩頬高得駭人，她　想，她張大了眼睛指望，她那最後一股的慾火，仍是像火𦦨一般燃燒着！</p>
<p>奥洛夫終于來了！大家都知道；這成者是他倆最後一次的會晤，不許他們見面吧，這畢生的隠痛，使他倆死也難安；見面吧，又没有這個規例，最後，終于在她的床前，張了一張　　！奥洛夫低着頭，像一個犯罪者走入囚牢裏一樣，他心痛，他悔恨，他想向前去抱着她的頭痛哭！然而他想到已經犯了一次罪，莫要再去增加自已的罪孽，他祇低，喊着；「坦拉喀挪華，你恕了我吧！」她聽着這個聲音，像非常熟識，她各道，這是奥洛夫；「呀，我的愛，我仍是愛你的！」但她已經説不也聲音來，她的兩片嘴唇類動着，好的臉上現出一絲絲的微笑，她心裏很知道奥洛夫已經來到她的床前，可憐的奥洛夫，她最後一次的微笑，他也没有機緣看到。</p>
<p>當奥洛夫一步一步地挨出修道院的時候，風聲吹送來一陣悲切的聲音，他側着耳朶靜聽，兩只眼睛向裏張望，一個黑影睡在舁床上，四個女尼棰着，直向那藏屍室走去，波茜蒂公主用手帕　着眼淚，在後面泣送。</p>
<p>奥洛夫的黑影，也跟着這悲切的　　而消逝·　　（完）</p>

<h3>最新圖書館建築之要點（二）</h3>
<p>松夫</p>
<p>閲者的地位</p>
<p>閲者的地位，包括三方面：一，閲書室；</p>
<p>二，卡片目錄；三，出納處。其中最要注意的是最後一項。因爲這是圖書館中的書籍與閲者間的中介，是圖書館的中心點。因爲圖書館的三個要素丨書籍，</p>
<p>閲者，館員。丨都是在這裏接會的。在理論上，出納處在藏書室與閲覧室的中間。在實際上，許多都是設在這個地位。出納處所佔的地位，應該能夠照顧前面或二旁最大的地位。如進門，走廊，</p>
<p>目錄，卡片及閲覧室等。而同時又要接近書庫，以便檢取或收還書籍。出納處前後，均應有充分闊大的地方。出納處光線第一要充足。最好從二面射入。因爲用天窗的，在晨早的時候極爲黑暗。</p>
<p>至於在日間工作的時候。如用電燈，尤爲不宜。</p>
<p>閲書室也有很多不同的種類；如普通閲覧室，兒童閲覧室，參考室，雑誌室，專門閲覧室，研究室，討論室等等。各種用處不同，大小地位和結構也不同。所以很難一槪而論。但以普通情形而論，閲覧室愈簡單愈直接愈好。切忌循廻曲折。圓形或八角形的閲覧室，雖然理論家常認爲不滿，但是如果佈置得當，也無大礙。苟建築得法，也非常雅致。如Ｏｘｆｏｒｄ的Ｒａｄｃｌｉｆｆｅ　Ｌｉｂｒａｒｙ，</p>
<p>Ｌｏｎｄｏｎ的Ｂｒｉｔｉｓｂ　Ｍｕｓｅｕｍ，Ｗａｓｈｉｎｇｔｏｎ的Ｃｏｎｇｒｅｓｓｉｏｎａｌ　Ｌｉｂｒａｒｙ和ＮｅｗＹｏｒｋ的ＣｏｌｕｍｂｉａＵｎｉｖｅｒｓｉｔｙＬｉｂｒａｒｙ都是非常壯麗。</p>
<p>在閲覧室方面，最重要的問題，就是光線。如果光線從一面射入的，那麽室寛最多不能過窗高的５０至６０％。如果室高１４或１５呎，窗檻可以離地高至４１／２或甚至５呎。因此四周牆壁，有３１／２至４１／２的地位，可以安放書架，連接不斷，凡窗檻愈高，光線直逹愈遠。大約有二面光的閲覧室，要有三十多呎闊十五呎高，方爲合度。天窗的光線，非不可用，但晨早必嫌太暗。可以閲覧室不能專靠天窗的光線的。</p>
<p>閲覧室除特别情形之外。丨如祇限於檢閲室内書籍而不能取書庫内的書的丨應與書庫接近，而且在出納處附近，以便司出納者，同時可照顧閲覧室的閲者。</p>
<h3>館員的地位</h3>
<p>館員的地位分一，館書室及總務室等；二，編目室，製卡室等；三，登記室，分館室等；四，裝釘室，印刷室等；五，</p>
<p>貯藏室，膳室，退息室等；六，雑役室等。在大圖書館内，還有委員室，董事室等。對於各室的佈置，很難定普通的規例。但是最要的，是各室的徵置，要合宜於所辦的事。出入要便利，光線要充足。對於辦事上的經濟，彼此接合的便利，居間的安樂，都要特别注意。</p>
<h3>建築道路的研究</h3>
<p>筠</p>
<p>道路建築這個名目。已經成爲中國目前的要圖。並且爲舉國上下共同所努力的。這是中國前途的徵象。不過治道路的方法。千頭萬緒。非一二言所能講盡的。現在大槪説其中的要素。約可分爲二端。第一是路的寛狹。第二是建築上的類别。路面的寛狹。不得一定。經濟距離。和往來的車輛多寡。都要預先精密的計核。所謂公路的闊度。是包括二輛車輛。（大小須相同）在同時能夠自由往來的廣袤而説。是足使二車安全的通行。轉灣的時候。就可不必彼此後退相讓。</p>
<p>公路的建築。也不外依照上述的原理。而鑒定類别的。當地的土地。當地的材料。向别的地方購來材料的運費。</p>
<p>和工資等等。都應當逐一的討論。而不容疏忽。</p>
<p>道路的建築。種類約有二個。呌做「堅實」和「半堅實」的分别。堅實的道路。大都都用「三和土」舖築而成的。它的費用很鉅。把中國目下的情形。社會上所需要的説。半堅實的道路比較得合時宜。不過建築的方法。必須按照各地方的趨勢而區别的。</p>
<p>道路的基礎。關係非淺。優劣的分别。要在即用的材料和費用的多寡。</p>
<p>立基的方法。不外以大石塊夾以碎石。作爲底層。而泥沙舖在路的表面。</p>
<p>但是這項材料。如果缺乏。却另可用别的東西替代。至於物體上的大小。則隨道路的質料和土地的情形而定。但在持久上。不得不發生問題了。</p>
<p>道路不透雨水。這也是緊要的一點。致成的方法。恃半路面情形。普通手續。大都用柏油或混合物。内中含地瀝考和他種舖路材料參雑。滾塗路面。可使得堅硬平坦。</p>
<p>排泄雨水的方法。也屬重要。而且必須去考研。因爲泄水快慢。和道路的安全與壽命。有密切的關係。最妥善的方法是在路的二旁。挖以相當的溝渠。</p>
<p>道路的中心。築以充分的拱頂。這要看路面質料的性格的。路的闊度。規定供頂的高低。</p>
<p>大凡一公路在未築成以前。最好是先通行車輛。一年或半年之後。再行舖築末層的路面。俾得塡舖週備。路基方能穏固。保持道路一層。也是重要。倘若按照交通的狀况。天氣的好壞。路面的情狀。隨時修理。用費旣屬不多。道路也永徵完善的現狀。而不效崎嶇斜偪的怪狀。</p>
<p>路面載重。必須要有限制。非有裝用汽車胎的車輛。不宜准行。至於保持的方法。類爲塗油修理等等。毌庸斷絶交通。可以分邊的整理。餘留一邊。以備車輛通行。這較爲便利。</p>
<h3>再談城巿設計</h3>
<p>古節筠</p>
<p>十年以還吾國人倡行新市政的事盈耳，，然而一考國内所謂市政者，去歐美的巿政旣然很遠，去所謂理想的市政更遠了，其中原因很多，大約説之，有下列數個：第一由於地方財政的困難；第二由於國内城巿，大都是已成建設，所以所謂巿政者，僅僅屬於改良舊有的城巿，而不是從新的規費。我們從巿政的經騐去觀察，那末改良城巿，恒較剏建城巿爲難，所以巿政的進步自然緩了；第三由於缺乏整固城巿的設計，大凡應當改良的，或剏建一個城巿的預先，</p>
<p>應當有整固的設計，像路線的確定，交通的設計如水利的電燈的渠溝，術生和公用與私人建築等等的規盡，都必須預先具有遠大眼光的全盤籌算，否則祇顧目前片斷的改良的那末十年或二十年後的人口，物力激進的時候，則原有種種或不適用，或不足應付環境的需求，致使陷全巿巿政於停滯的死象。此外附帶發生的弊端的像因爲巿政的發逹，地價就激增。，投機就競起，致令貧苦的人們，越加痛苦，又像工商業，居宅區域不分，塵嚣萬丈，煤氣熏蒸，妨礙公共衛生等種種，這都足爲全巿的致命傷，這是由於當時缺乏整個計劃的緣故。</p>
<p>在我們譚巿政的人，都輒以上海爲模榰，雖然公共與法租界的房屋，粗具規模，然而它的缺點宐實在不勝枚舉，試就房屋先去證明，上海租界的房屋，在普通人去看，以爲雄偉美麗，識的人則以爲高低參差，不十分美麗，至於説到分界問題，更不敢肓從了。試觀上海英法大馬路的貿易區，内中有住宅也有工廠隨便建築，毫無秩序，其妨礙公共衛生，公共安寗，誠非淺鮮。更把電車而講，大凡街道可以建築電車道的務須寛大，如公共租界五馬路和法租界的東新橋等各段，其街道何其狹小，而電車竟行駛其中，所以在交通上往往諸多窒礙。尤有進者，依照歐美新巿政的制度，</p>
<p>大凡在貿易區内，應當建設空氣草地，</p>
<p>供商人隨便休息，上海公共租界，祇有極少數的沿革巿口和蘇州河邊的幾塊草地而已。其不便於吾人實多矣。其它的缺點甚多，現在不再贅述，然而從這地方可以看到上海租界的巿政不甚良好了。至於國人舉辦的巿政，則更比租界的巿政而下了。上海的巿政弱點旣然很繁，歸納而講，則不外是由於當時，對於全巿没有整個的城巿設計，等到城巿發逹了以後，則又難於變更，遂致使城巿陷於不完不備的地境，所以以後講巿政的人，應當注意在城計的問題，對於一巿在未曾舉辦巿政之前，應具備遠大眼光的整個設計，然後再按步施行，方才可以不陷於前人的覆轍，。然而怎樣是呌做城巿設計呢，現在略而説明如下：</p>
<p>城巿設計乃是計畫建設城巿的科學，它的目的，是在造成都巿進於交通便利，住處衛生，環境優美的地境，所以從巿政的廣義而説，那末巿政行政機關的各部分中，幾希不與有密切之關係的。因爲城巿設計，原是包涵碼頭船塢鐵道，商業經營的設計街道地道車道，巿内外交通的規劃，其餘如水料渠道電燈公共房屋，公園遊戲塲，私人建築公共衛生等等，這些都屬於當城巿設計的時候，所當精心規劃·是以求城巿建設的美麗，工商業的發逹，巿民的安居樂業等等，必須要有良好的設計。</p>
<p>又美國著名城巿設計研究專家亞維諾路雖在他的著作中，曾經講述都巿設計的之大綱領，謂都巿設計的第一目的，是在保巿民的健康，和房屋問題，自來水問題，溝渠問題，公立巿場問題，</p>
<p>及其它衛生等許多問題等等，都包括在内。第二目的，是在營巿民十分有效的勞動，像交通機關問題，商業區，工業區，住宅區，適當配置整理的問題，都包括在内。第三目的，使巿民得利用餘暇謀身心健全的發逹，像公園，遊戲場以及和其它許多問題都包括在内，從這點而看，那末城巿設計的意義，我們很明白了。</p>
<p>普通人對於城巿設計，多以爲屬於工程方面的問題，要知道一個城巿的設計，工程問題僅屬一部分，其它如衛生設計，財政設計，法規制定，和工程同一重要的，，由此可知，當一個城巿設計時，不獨應該搜集工程的人材，并且還要應當召致醫學，法律經濟的人才，以求各方面的同時發懈呀。</p>

<h3>門窗之研究</h3>
<p>霜</p>
<p>門和窗，雖然是房屋的附屬部份，可是對於人們日常的生活，也有很重大的關係，因爲門窗能夠供給天然的光線，空氣的流通。所以我們建造房屋，對於門窗設備，應該特别注意：尤其是公共建築物，</p>
<p>像旅館·戲院·公司等等，尤應多關門窗，使出入便利，和光線充足，因爲這是間接有關公衆衛生和便利的。</p>
<p>像吾國昔時的房屋　　踏進裏面，便覺得陰暗潮濕。最大的原因，便是缺乏窗户，光線不充中；這是影響於人們日常的生活，所以這種建築，到了現代，已不適用而歸於淘汰了。</p>
<p>現在先講「門」吧。</p>
<p>西洋的建築，像住宅·公司·學校等，都用鑲板式門。其他不重要的地方，則用架形式門。至於工廠建築，本來是以堅固爲目的，所以用鋼門的最多。</p>
<p>再講「窗」：</p>
<p>窗的位置，直接影響於光線，所以必須注意其佈置的方法。普通學校房屋之窗所佔的面積，須不能少於地板面積的百分之二十至二十五。對於光線，有下列幾椿須要注意：（一）光線的來源須連續不斷；（二）光線須充足，並須散佈全室；（三）窗堂的地位，要避去太陽的直射光線，而使之成反射光線。</p>
<p>（窗的面積）　光線射入處的大小面積，我們須看房門的深度，高和窗的位置而定。學校房屋中窗的面積，已在上面説過了。工廠房屋，照現在的趨向，無論屋面天窗與壁上窗，都以玻璃造成爲佳；但普通窗的面積，須照地板面積百分之五十至六十。</p>
<p>（窗的高度）　要是室内的窗，祇關在一邊牆上，欲使全室的先線充足，那麽，房間的深度，須不能超過窗的高度三倍。倘若二邊牆上都有窗，則牠的高度不能比房屋的深度四分之一再少了。</p>
<p>（窗的種類）　窗的種類，大約可分三種：（一）固定窗架，（二）活動窗架，（三）樞紐窗架。</p>
<p>活動窗架，又有單扇活動與雙扇活動的分别。其構造是一種窗架，内部裝滑車，一端平衡以重量，因了外力的拉動，滑車轉動，窗便能上下活動了。</p>
<p>樞紐窗架，全窗的活動，都依靠窗的一邊上的樞紐而轉動，所以有許多建築，都採用這一種。</p>
<p>（鋼窗）　二十世紀新時代的建築。無論何種材料，都採用科學的方法製造，鋼窗，是其中之一。大凡稍高大的建築，都採用鋼窗來代替木窗。牠的利益是：質地堅固，雖經風雨的侵蝕，也不容易損壞。</p>
<p>並且又可增加建築的觀瞻，倘在都巿中熱閙區内的建築，裝了鋼窗，</p>
<p>可以免除車馬的震顫。</p>
<p>所以我敢説，鋼窗在建築上，可以得到不敗的地位。</p>

<p>External News of the Fall of Qinhuangdao</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to foreign sources, the details of the fall of Qinhuangdao are as follows. It is said that the Japanese army began attacking the Chinese army's positions early last Saturday morning, simultaneously bombing heavily two or three miles northwest of Qinhuangdao, reaching hundreds of bombs. Afterward, the "Man" army, covered by the Japanese artillery team, began attacking, and the Japanese aircraft indiscriminately threw bombs everywhere. By 2:00 PM on Saturday afternoon, the Chinese army began to withdraw from Qinhuangdao, and the Chinese police maintained order in the city. The Chinese military commander stationed in Qinhuangdao sent Japanese troops to protect the station. The city was then still quiet. On Saturday and Sunday, some refugees carried items and fled to the Kailuan Coal Mining Bureau. At 5:00 AM on Sunday morning, Qinhuangdao was safely occupied by 50 members of the "National Salvation Army" under Li Jichun. Trains between Tianjin and Qinhuangdao have been interrupted. It is heard that the railway west of Beidaihe has been destroyed. According to another foreign source, Haiyang has also been occupied by the Japanese army, and the "Man" army is still advancing west and south. The Chinese army seems to have withdrawn to the Luan River. The Japanese authorities in Qinhuangdao claim that the fighting with the Chinese army is by non-official troops, but looking at the facts in Haiyang, it can be proven that this theory is absurd. Because non-official troops would never have heavy artillery and airplanes. Moreover, the reason for the Chinese army's retreat is clearly due to the oppression of the Japanese army. (Reuters Dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>A Certain Tianjin Agency Receives Consecutive Urgent Telegrams</p>
<p>(Tianjin) A certain agency in Tianjin received four urgent telegrams from Luanzhou this morning, the contents of which are unknown. (17th Dispatch)</p>

At dawn on the 15th, about two or three thousand enemy soldiers of the Japanese-puppet coalition first intensely bombarded our positions in the Zhuziyu Qianzhuang area with heavy artillery, and then charged with machine guns as the main force. Our army fought bravely until 11:00 AM. Suddenly, more than a thousand enemy soldiers came from the Lingkou to raid our left rear Beizhuanghe. Our army immediately fell into being attacked from the side and back, and urgently transferred all forces to aid in a very fierce battle. Finally, with the enemy being numerous and we being few, the entire road was withdrawn at 3:00 PM on the 16th. Now most of them have gathered in the Changli Anshan Station area, and depending on the necessity of the situation, they will withdraw to the west bank of the Luan River. (17th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Enemy Troops at Xifengkou Approach Santunying</h3>

Recently, due to the successive loss of Lengkou and Dongjiakou, four to five thousand enemy troops from the two passes all went to the rear of our mountain peaks inside the pass. Our army had no choice but to concentrate in Luanyang City and abandon the mountain peaks inside the pass. That place was once tense a few days ago, and the situation afterwards is unknown. Song's unit is now concentrated on the west bank of the Luan River, blocking the enemy from crossing the river. The Japanese army concentrated artillery fire on the east bank of the river from time to time and fired at us. Yesterday's battle resulted in 35 officer deaths and injuries. (17th Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Exchange of Notes for the Return of the Dutch Boxer Indemnity</h3>
<p>Ministry of Foreign Affairs Announces the Original Text of the Bilateral Notes</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Dutch return of the Boxer Indemnity was exchanged on the 4th, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced the following exchange of notes between Foreign Minister Luo and the Dutch Ambassador on the 17th.</p>
<p>▲Outgoing Note Luo, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of China, regarding the note, I hereby reiterate regarding the Dutch portion of the Boxer Indemnity that your government expressed its willingness in October 1925 to use the Boxer Indemnity due in the future for the benefit of Chinese enterprises, and voluntarily declared that our government received the declaration and expressed its gratitude. Now our government understands that your government, in order to implement the above declaration, intends to return the full amount of the Boxer Indemnity due from January 1, 1926, to the Chinese government for the following purposes and used in accordance with the following provisions: (1) 65% of the returned funds should be used for Chinese water conservancy projects, and 35% should be used for cultural purposes in accordance with the provisions of Sections 5, 6, and 7; (2) of the above water conservancy project funds, 400,000 yuan should be used for the Nanjing Surveying and Mapping Institute, and the remainder should be allocated to Nanjing's water conservancy expenditures; (3) the funds used for Chinese water conservancy projects should be managed by a board of directors composed of two Chinese directors and one Dutch director. All of these directors should be appointed by the Chinese government, and one of them should be designated as chairman; (4) for the above water conservancy projects, the Chinese government is willing to hire one Dutch senior engineer to handle the specialized affairs needed by the Chinese government. The salary of the engineer should be paid from the water conservancy project funds; (5) regarding the 35% for cultural purposes, 400,000 guilders should be allocated immediately from the funds accumulated since January 1, 1926, and currently held by the Dutch government, as a cultural fund. This fund should be managed by a board of directors composed of the Chinese diplomatic representative stationed in The Hague, the President of the Faculty of Arts of the Royal Academy of Sciences in Amsterdam, Netherlands, and the President of the University of Leiden; (6) in order to enhance Sino-Dutch cultural relations, 53% of the interest earned by the cultural fund should be given to the Academia Sinica of China each year, of which 13/53 of the annual interest should be used by the Academia Sinica as a subsidy for its business, and 40/53 of the annual interest should be used for sending Chinese scholars and students to study in the Netherlands. This ratio may be changed by the board of directors of the Cultural Fund upon application by the Academia Sinica. The approval of the number of students studying abroad should be decided by the Academia Sinica in consultation with the Dutch Minister to China. The remaining 47% of the annual interest income of the Cultural Fund should be donated to the Institute of Sinology at the University of Leiden in the Netherlands, and the Institute of Sinology will use the funds to enhance cultural relations between China and the Netherlands. The Institute of Sinology and the Academia Sinica should calculate the funds received in the previous year each year and prepare a report to the Board of Directors of the Cultural Fund; (7) all expenses related to the handling of the Cultural Fund before the principal of 400,000 guilders and the annual interest of 53% and 47% are finalized should be deducted from the annual interest. After the Dutch government has deducted all advances and the interest calculation is completed, when the amount represented by the above 35% is determined, the difference between this amount and the 400,000 guilders stated in Section 5 should be allocated to the Cultural Fund. As soon as the Cultural Fund is increased accordingly, the annual interest portions that the Academia Sinica of China and the Institute of Sinology at the University of Leiden in the Netherlands should receive will also be increased according to the ratio specified in the previous section; (8) all Boxer Indemnity payments due in the future will be delivered by the Chinese government to the Dutch diplomatic representative stationed in China, and the Dutch representative will transfer the funds to the account of the Board of Directors stated in Section 1. In view of this, I would like to ask your Excellency to verify the above understanding on behalf of the Dutch government and reply. I hereby send this note. Luo Wengan Seal, Dutch Minister Plenipotentiary to China Du</p>
<p>▲Reply Note Du, Dutch Minister Plenipotentiary to China, regarding the reply, I have received your Minister's note today stating, (same as the outgoing note). I have reported the exchange of notes of today to my government, and I have been instructed to express my agreement with the proposal of your country's government to utilize the remaining amount of the Dutch Boxer Indemnity in the future.

<h3>Zhang Ji Went to Xinxiang Yesterday</h3>
<p>Talks on Moving the North China Office Northward Undecided</p>
<p>The Entire Nation Should Unite and Strive for Self-Defense</p>
<p>(Zhengzhou) Zhang Ji arrived in Zhengzhou from Beijing at 7 PM on the 16th, staying at the Da Jin Tai Hotel. He is scheduled to go to Xinxiang at 7 AM on the 17th. Zhang stated that the decision to move the North China Office north has not been made. Some advocate moving to Baoding, while he advocates moving to Ding County or rural areas, because the nation is based on agriculture. If rural governance is perfected, then county governance will be good. If county governance is completed, then the nation will naturally be strong. Some politicians at sea talk grandly about opening up the government, but their intention is mostly to seize power for their own benefit. He advocates that if the government is opened up, it must be returned to the people. Now, at this time when the nation is about to perish, he hopes that the press will work hard to startle those who are numb and apathetic. The entire nation, from top to bottom, should be tense and strive to organize the Baojia system and strengthen the people's self-defense forces. Regarding Zhang Xueliang's ancient calligraphy and paintings at the Summer Palace, it is reported that Zhang said that they were mistakenly packed into a box when organizing his luggage before leaving Peiping. He will return them when they are found, but whether he will return them in the future is up to Zhang, and whether to pursue them is up to the Shanghai Municipal Government. The Jiangxi bandits have gradually been suppressed since Chiang arrived in Jiangxi. It is not yet decided whether they will go north recently. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 16th)</p>
<h3>Xinjiang Hui-Han Conflict</h3>
<p>Hui Representatives Telegraph Suggestions for Handling</p>
<p>Beijing Islamic Association Holds Meeting</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Jin Chunwu and others, representatives of all the Hui people in Xinjiang, recently telegraphed the Central Government, stating that the Hami Hui people have again allied with a subordinate of a certain Mr. since last winter, advancing from Hami via a secret route to encroach on Turpan and Shanshan.</p>
<p>The Hui people there initially leaned towards the government and cooperated in resisting the enemy. However, because Chairman Jin was not good at handling the situation, the psychology of the Hui people changed, leading to today's revolutionary movement, which has spread throughout Xinjiang. The Yan'an and Ahe districts have all fallen. Currently, only the Kashgar district is maintained by Executive Director Ma Shaowu, which is still peaceful. They requested that the Central Government severely punish Jin and task Ma Shaowu with cleaning up the situation in Xinjiang, etc. (Special dispatch on the 17th)</p>

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>Abandoning Luan Dong (Sadly)</h3>
<p>Since the September 18th Incident occurred two years ago, the issue of resisting Japan has been a mystery in our country from beginning to end. If we say that we have not resisted from beginning to end, the calls for resistance have been loud and clear. Petitions to volunteer have been reported in the newspapers every day. If we believe that we have resisted, there has been fighting in one part of the country and observation in another, without an overall plan or consistent strategy. The result of sporadic resistance has been individual defeats. This kind of confusing and perplexing phenomenon is truly incomprehensible.</p>
<p>For the past year and a half, under this kind of confusing and perplexing phenomenon, first Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang fell one after another. Then Yuguan soon followed. A month ago, the natural stronghold of Rehe was abandoned voluntarily. The invaders are deepening their penetration, and our territory is shrinking day by day. And the continuation of this phenomenon remains the same. Now, following the fall of Lengkou, Luandong has also been evacuated. Song Zheyuan's troops, who were guarding Xifengkou, are trapped in a state of isolated and arduous struggle. The triangular area east of the Luan River, estimated to be 1,500 square miles of territory, has now fallen into the hands of the enemy.</p>
<p>According to telegrams, our troops in the Funing and Changli areas began to withdraw from the previous evening.</p>
<p>The first group of enemies to enter Qinhuangdao numbered only two hundred. Luandong refugees have suffered not only from bombing raids but also from looting. Women and children collapsed on the road, and many were violated. The cries shook the wilderness, and heaven and earth grieved. If we close our eyes and silently imagine this tragic scene, how can we not</p>
<p>feel the pain? At the same time, on the other hand, there are reports of Song Zheyuan's troops fighting arduous battles in isolation, with entire regiments being wiped out one after another. The magnificence of their sacrifice is truly enough to move heaven and earth and make the ghosts cry. Alas, what are these fleeing people and these fallen soldiers sacrificing for? Are they sacrificing for the country, or are they sacrificing for the nation? Their blood is spilled on the battlefield, their bones are buried in the wilderness, the old and weak are displaced, and the young and strong are scattered. The enemy flag of the rising sun points directly towards Tianjin and Hebei. Wherever the iron hooves tread, the mountains and rivers change color. However, our central government is focusing on "suppressing bandits." The Southwest is making daily announcements of troop deployments. The other provinces are merely standing by as spectators. Is there any hope for the future of the country?</p>
<p>Judging from the resistance in Shanghai last year and the arduous battles fought by Song Zheyuan's troops outside the passes this time, our morale is not incapable of fighting a battle. Our military strength is also not incapable of being used. At the same time, according to Xiong Xiling's dispatch from the front, which describes the true situation of the military and civilians resisting Japan, "Farmers in various counties in Hebei have transported vehicles, mules, horses, firewood, and grass to the army, totaling tens of millions. Vehicles alone</p>
<p>number 2.5 million. Zunhua County alone has reached a million, all from the blood and sweat of farmers. They are destroying their homes to alleviate the national crisis and sacrificing for the country." Thus, the people's spirit is also not incapable of fighting a battle. Our soldiers are not soldiers who cannot fight, and our people are not people who are willing to let the country perish. However, we are unwilling to make a decisive battle. We truly cannot understand it after thinking about it a hundred times.</p>
<p>We believe that the matter is now urgent. The disaster of destruction is approaching. It is impossible to remain calm. Moreover, how can a nation of 400 million people just tie their hands and close their eyes, waiting for death? The people are in a panic, fearing that their days are numbered. What will happen today? The government should make a final and thorough consideration as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>The Central Route Army Recovers Yongfeng</h3>

Fuzhou is building fortifications to defend on one hand, and advancing south to suppress on the other.

It was chaired by Ye Chucang. Li Yuying reported, mainly stating that he spent the most time in Geneva during his trip to Europe. Various international organizations and institutions, whether political, economic, or academic, are very developed and are all gathered in Switzerland. Therefore, Geneva has almost become an international metropolis, proving that international cooperation and mutual assistance are suitable for modern needs. The Premier's legacy includes the idea that human evolution should be based on the principle of mutual assistance. The League of Nations was established based on the spirit of cooperation and mutual assistance. The methods and directions for resolving the Sino-Japanese problem were correct, although the decisive measure of economic sanctions could not be used. However, this is only a difference in degree, proving that the League of Nations is for the majority and cannot rely on a few countries to be arbitrary. He attended the World Cultural Cooperation Association on behalf of Mr. Zhihui. The association holds an annual meeting every July. This time, it was decided to establish an international library in Geneva to promote the World Cultural Cooperation Movement. Upon his return, he reported everything to Mr. Wu, who was very satisfied. Finally, he had some thoughts: all comrades should abide by the Premier's legacy that human evolution should be based on the principle of cooperation and mutual assistance, sincerely unite, and work together. Only then will the country have a way to be saved. On a larger and longer-term scale, we can solve world problems and achieve the Premier's ideal of a world of great harmony. After finishing his speech, the meeting was adjourned. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 17th)</p>

<h3>Japanese Government Convenes Local Governors Conference</h3>
<p>Saito Delivers an Address, Expressing That He Will Not Step Down Temporarily</p>
<p>Uchida Delivers a Speech, Urging National Unity</p>
<p>The Japanese Political Situation Remains in Turmoil</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese cabinet convened a local governors conference at the Prime Minister's official residence at 9:00 AM this morning, lasting for one week. More than 40 governors from across the country attended. Finance Minister Takahashi first delivered a speech on the points to be noted in the implementation of the new budget and the Japanese government's fiscal and tax system reorganization policy. Justice Minister Oyama delivered a speech on strategies to deal with the Communist Party and various anti-imperialist organizations. Interior Minister Yamamoto delivered a speech on addressing internal turmoil and various domestic political issues. Prime Minister Saito said that since taking office last June, he recognized the independence of "Manchukuo" on September 15 and clashed with the League of Nations over the Manchurian issue, leading to the withdrawal from the League of Nations on March 27. The policy to be adopted in the future has been clearly indicated in the Emperor's edict. Everyone should abide by the edict and lead the local people. This year's budget increased by 400 million yuan compared to last year. There is currently no hope of increasing revenue, and it is not a time to increase taxes. Therefore, we will issue public bonds to overcome this severe period. Currently, there are slight signs of hope in the economic sector. I hope that everyone can step up the promotion of local people's self-reliance. Since I formed the cabinet, I have made great efforts to eliminate malpractices in the political arena, and the results are remarkable.</p>
<p>However, the extraordinary situation has not been resolved, and the cabinet's mission remains arduous. There are rumors about the future of the political situation. Everyone should respect themselves, not be misled, and redouble their efforts to save the country's future, etc. From this, it can be seen that Prime Minister Saito still expressed his reluctance to leave office. (China United Press dispatch on the 17th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Foreign Minister Uchida delivered a speech at the local governors conference today, saying that Japan's withdrawal from the League of Nations seems to have put it in a difficult international position, but judging from the recent developments, there is no need to panic.

<p>(Tokyo) Prime Minister Saito's instructions at the local governors conference today mentioned the future of the political situation, saying that the government is determined to move forward with the cooperation of the people. It is known that Prime Minister Saito will wait for Finance Minister Takahashi to resign after the May 15th Incident is resolved, and will decide to reorganize the cabinet and continue to maintain it.

<p>(Tokyo) The future of the Japanese political situation is still unstable. Finance Minister Takahashi is prepared to submit his resignation to Prime Minister Saito after the local governors conference ends. Because the future of the political situation is still unstable, the agencies of various provinces have not started new projects for the new year. In the Seiyukai, those who actively urge Takahashi to step down are from the Suzuki faction. Others, such as the Tokonami and Kuhara factions, are temporarily supporting Takahashi to continue in office. The internal opinions of the only opposition party have not been unified. The future of the Japanese political situation remains in turmoil. (China United Press dispatch on the 17th)</p>

<h3>The Pseudo-State Buys the Chinese Eastern Railway, Soviet Russia Expresses Rejection</h3>
<p>Manchurian Railway and Ussuri Agreement</p>
<p>Japanese Telegraph Service to Be Abandoned</p>
<p>(Dalian) According to news here, the government of the "Pseudo-Manchukuo" is currently negotiating with Soviet Russia to purchase the Chinese Eastern Railway and the interests affiliated with the railway. It is said that Soviet Russia is unwilling to accept the conditions offered. (Reuters dispatch on the 17th)</p>
<p>(Harbin) The transportation agreement between the Manchurian Railway and the Ussuri Railway will expire in September 1931. The Ussuri side once proposed to the Manchurian Railway to revise this agreement at the end of this month. The Manchurian Railway requested payment of 780,000 US dollars exceeding the returned amount of goods. Soviet Russia refused, causing the negotiations to stall until now. The Manchurian Railway believes that it is impossible to revise the agreement and has decided to abolish it. If it is abolished, then goods traveling south and east will inevitably cause fierce competition between the Manchurian Railway and the Ussuri Railway, and a major scramble for goods will unfold.

<h3>The British Government Orders All Institutions in Manchuria to Prepare for Total Withdrawal</h3>
<p>The Japanese Side is Greatly Agitated</p>
<p>According to the Osaka Mainichi Shimbun on the 14th, the British government</p>
<p>suddenly issued a total withdrawal order to all banks and commercial companies in Manchuria. The gist of the telegram stated that "All banks, companies, and societies in Manchuria that have a relationship with the British government should immediately prepare for total withdrawal. When the total withdrawal occurs, all affairs will be temporarily handled within Chinese territory," etc. Currently, all relevant agencies are secretly preparing. The Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank's Fengtian branch held an important meeting, stating that it would convene creditors in early this month, with May 1 as the liquidation date. The most noteworthy thing in the statement is the phrase "The consulate and the bank's withdrawal are completely in accordance with the British government's policy." If it becomes a reality, a major change will occur in Anglo-Japanese diplomacy. Currently, all parties are paying close attention to Britain's attitude, but its true nature is still difficult to determine.</p>
<h3>Turkey, Following India,</h3>
<p>Resists the Dumping of Japanese Goods</p>
<p>(Tokyo) After the September 18th Incident, Japanese merchants lost their business in China due to military aggression. To remedy this loss, they actively adopted a dumping policy in the South Seas, India, Egypt, and Turkey. As a result, Turkey's national industry suffered greatly. To protect its domestic industry and prevent the dumping policy of Japan, the Turkish government notified Japan of the cancellation of the commercial treaty and raised tariffs on Japanese goods again. The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, upon hearing the news, immediately ordered Ambassador Yoshida to negotiate with the Turkish government.</p>
<p>However, Turkey will follow India's approach, and it will be difficult to reach an agreement. (China United Press dispatch on the 17th)</p>
<h3>National Government Memorial Weekly</h3>
<p>Dai Chuanxian Speaks on Unity to Save the Country</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The National Government held a Memorial Weekly service at 9:00 AM on the 17th, attended by Chairman Lin, Yu Youren, Dai Chuanxian, Li Yuanding, Chen Shaokuan, and more than 300 others. Chairman Lin and Dai spoke on the topic of unity to save the country, mainly saying that Japan is using pseudo-organizations to create various plans to destroy China. The main points are: (1) Japan wants to carry out subversive and divisive movements in Mongolia, Xinjiang, and Tibet to make our compatriots fall for it. (2) To undermine our internal unity, disrupt the government, break up the strength of the provinces, and isolate the central government, attacking from the outside while attacking from the inside. If we want to survive, we must love each other, unite, sincerely cooperate, sacrifice personal opinions, gather the strength of the people, and create the strength of the country. If the people cannot trust each other, the resistance will be reduced. Mutual trust creates life, mutual suspicion creates death, mutual assistance creates life, mutual contention creates death, mutual love creates life, and mutual hatred creates death. The people should eliminate suspicion, understand each other, help each other, and establish a belief in self-salvation. Strengthening the central government is the only way out for the life of the people of the whole country. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 17th)</p>

<p>US Domestic Relief Needs Funds, Plans to Issue Bonds</p>
<p>▲National News Agency, Washington, 16th – It was learned today that President Roosevelt has drafted four special messages to Congress, which will be sent to the Senate and House of Representatives in the next few days. It is said that the first message requests the power to negotiate mutual tariff agreements after discussions with delegations from various countries coming here for economic events and formal meetings. The second message concerns the issuance of bonds, which is necessary to relieve the current situation of farmer mortgages and implement procedures for placing the unemployed. It is expected that the President will request the issuance of at least 30 billion US dollars in bonds this year. Emergency legislation is progressing well. The President now believes that permanent solutions to banking problems and railway affairs can be pursued. The other two messages relate to these two issues.</p>

<h3>Chairman of the US Immigration Committee Advocates</h3>
<p>Revising Immigration Laws</p>
<p>To Crack Down on Chinese Entering from Mexico</p>
<p>▲National News Agency, Washington, 16th – Mr. Diekstein, Chairman of the Immigration Committee of the US House of Representatives, has recently completed his plan to revise US immigration laws, nationality laws, and repatriation procedures, for adoption by this session of Congress. The main points include: (1) Preventing foreign nationals from entering the country from Cuba, Mexico, and other places; (2) Improving repatriation administration; (3) Revising nationality laws for the sake of uniformity and clarity; (4) Re-examining all proposals concerning immigration numbers carefully for the sake of uniformity; (5) Humanitarian improvements to immigration law, such as allowing elderly parents of American citizens to enter the country, etc. Mr. Diekstein said that various nationality laws already in place really need to be thoroughly re-evaluated. The reason is that in recent years, Congress has only known how to pass various amendments, making unlimited additions and deletions to the original nationality laws, and no new nationality law has emerged to replace them, resulting in the current chaotic state of American nationality, making it impossible for non-experts in nationality law to understand the general situation. Therefore, it should be reorganized today to make it simple and easy to understand. As for the number of immigrants entering the country, it must be calculated together with European countries in the future to be accurate, he said. Mr. Diekstein is quite concerned about the cruelty of repatriation treatment and plans to request members of the House to form a special committee to review the matter. As for foreign nationals mixing into the US from Cuba and the coastal areas are the most prevalent. A large number of Japanese and Chinese are also entering illegally on the Mexican border. They use many methods, so to prevent this illegal act, it is necessary to first investigate the methods they commonly use, and then establish regulations to strictly prohibit them. At the same time, it is also possible to consider whether the repatriation procedures are inhumane so that these habitual offenders cannot re-enter illegally, he said.</p>
<h3>Rome Talks Have Important Implications</h3>
<p>Coordination Between Italy, Germany, and Austria</p>
<p>The Purpose is to Deal with France</p>
<p>Austrian Chancellor Leaves Italian Capital to Return Home</p>
<p>▲Havas, Rome, 17th – The talks between Italy, Germany, and Austria currently underway in Rome are considered to have important implications. It may also be used to deal with the refusal of various European countries related to the Four-Power Pact draft, which is not necessarily the case. The political situation in Austria is regarded in London as forming the basis of the Rome meeting. The dissolution of the Austrian Social Democratic Protection League has caused considerable unease here. The "Manchester Guardian" stated that Austrian Chancellor Dollfuss's advocacy of maintaining national independence is only regarded as a means of obtaining financial assistance from other countries and may not have any definite views.</p>
<p>▲National News Agency, Rome, 16th – Italy's famous newspaper, Tavell, today published an editorial on the revision of the peace treaty, the most insightful saying of which is "The idea of revising the peace treaty is advancing steadily, and no treaty can stop it." The newspaper added that this idea is based on the world's ardent desire for peace. This point was also acknowledged by the two German ministers who came to Italy recently. Moreover, Germany and Italy were in an adversarial position at the Paris Peace Conference, but now they have become coordinated, which is even more surprising and noteworthy, he said.</p>
<p>▲Havas News Agency, Rome, 17th – Austrian Chancellor Dollfuss left Rome by Austrian civil aviation plane at 10:00 this morning to return to Vienna. Italian Air Force Chief of Staff General Wahl and several generals, as well as the Austrian Minister to Italy, all went to the airport to see him off.</p>
<h3>Germans Secretly Photograph French Military Construction</h3>

Because they did not have legally signed passports, they were refused entry into French territory. When they returned to German territory, they sang patriotic songs, shouted "Hitler," and waved the swastika flag.</p>
<h3>Retrial of the British Engineers Case</h3>
<p>Russian Prosecutor Involves Court Issues</p>
<p>Criticizes the Remarks of British Parliamentarians</p>
<p>Defendant's Bribery is True, Cannot Be Pardoned According to Law</p>
<p>After Final Arguments, Verdict Expected Today or Tomorrow</p>
<p>▲Reuters, Moscow, 16th – The Soviet Russian prosecutor gave his summary of the case against the six Britons tonight during the retrial of the Vickers engineers' case. He offered much criticism of Britain. The retrial resumed at 9:15 PM tonight, and the audience seats in the courtroom were full. The head of the expert committee first answered questions raised by lawyer Munch-Hurse today, saying that a piece of metal could pass through the protective net of the turbine and damage the turbine. The turbines supplied by Vickers had been tested and were indeed different from what was guaranteed, and the technicians were also negligent in correcting the defects of the turbine blades. The expert committee found a turbine in the Moscow power plant that was not supplied by Vickers. Munch-Hurse immediately retorted, saying that he could not accept this answer satisfactorily. If the guarantee conditions had not been fulfilled, then why did the Soviet Union not notify the company concerned? Deputy Prosecutor Roginsky warned the defendant that he was not trying Vickers but was trying its employees. Munch-Hurse replied that the expert committee's answer was directed at Vickers, not at the defendant. Prosecutor Vyshinsky summarized the proceedings of the past four days, read out his lengthy written remarks, and said that our enemies are trying to suppress us in every way. I hope that the outcome of this case can strike a blow against our enemies. We do not want to allow others to interfere in our internal affairs. Capitalists do not like Soviet courts because they are class courts. British Member of Parliament Patrick said that he was ashamed to see Soviet judges smoking while hearing cases and that he himself had sat on hard wooden chairs. According to the British, the difference between Soviet and British courts is that British courts advocate fairness, while the Soviet Union is the opposite. (Patrick is a British Conservative MP who stated in the House of Commons on April 5 that he had observed a trial in Moscow and felt that the Soviet court was an instrument of class warfare.) At this point, the prosecutor cited Marx's saying that British courts have two kinds of laws, one for the rich and one for the poor. He also said that the British also use torture in India, and there are recent examples to prove it. The only place in the world with true fairness is Russia. Munch-Hurse and Thornton followed the instructions of the British White Paper and tried to insult the Soviet court, but no matter what, they could not prove that they had been mistreated by the Soviet Union. Munch-Hurse initially gave false testimony during the political investigation period and then asked for forgiveness for his lies. Regarding this point, I hope that the court will not pay attention to the petitions issued by the defendants Munch-Hurse Kerschney and Thornton regarding how the Soviet Union treated them. The Russians Vareni and Kutuzova are in league with the most heinous enemies, which is very wrong. The Russian defendants are slackers. Although the act of slacking has now been stopped, the defendants must not be pardoned. The prosecutor pointed out that the crimes of Munch-Hurse and Thornton were the most disgusting and that these two were more dangerous than the Russian defendants. The prosecutor then explained the definition of the term "espionage" to the court using the British Standard Dictionary, saying that the Soviet Union's definition of this term is the same as that of the United Kingdom. He also said that anyone who seeks news about people's political feelings is not committing espionage. The prosecutor later spoke about bribery, saying that Munch-Hurse had failed to explain whether the 3,000 rubles he gave to Polgov were a gift or a loan. British engineers might think that giving a small amount of money is not bribery in the Soviet Union. Know that this matter is bribery even under British law. Munch-Hurse and Thornton both knew that they would be severely punished because from the Soviet standpoint, bribery is a major crime. The court adjourned at 11:25 PM and will resume at 11:00 AM tomorrow morning. The defendants' lawyers will speak in defense at that time, and then the defendants will make their final statements. It is expected that the verdict can be rendered on Tuesday or Wednesday morning.</p>
<h3>Defendant Raises Ten Questions</h3>
<p>During the secret trial this morning, defendant Munch-Hurse raised ten questions to the technical advisory committee of the court, requesting answers. The court immediately decided that eight of the questions could be answered by the committee. The two items that were crossed out were those concerning the responsibility of Vickers Company. The court held that the persons being tried in this case were not the company or its representatives, but individual citizens, who were accused of criminal acts. Therefore, the court cannot accept these two questions. After this decision, the court announced that it would reopen at 7:00 PM to publish the Technical Committee's answers to Munch's questions. (Tass News Agency, 16th)</p>
<h3>Russian Newspaper Publishes Diplomatic Talks Regarding Britain</h3>
<p>The talks between Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Litvinov and British Ambassador Lord Voffan regarding the engineer case have been published. The Soviet government organ Izvestia commented that "the British people do not know the content of the talks, so they cannot know the calmness and firm attitude expressed by Foreign Commissar Litvinov to Lord Voffan. This is quite regrettable. Litvinov made it clear to Voffan that although the Soviet government was under various threats, it was unwilling to give up its right to review all the documents in the case and submit them to the court. The court hearing has proved that it would have been better if the British government had shown calmness similar to that of Soviet Russia." The communist organ Pravda stated, "The British ambassador not only demanded that Litvinov immediately release the defendants and declare them innocent, but also wanted the Soviet government to guarantee that such accidents would not happen again in the future. His attitude can be described as strange." (Havas News Agency, 16th)</p>
<h3>Six British Defendants May Not Escape Death in Soviet Russia</h3>
<p>Russian Prosecutor Vyshinsky did not state what penalties should be imposed if the charges of sabotage and espionage against the six Britons were true, but judging from the current situation, the Britons may not escape death. Vyshinsky said in his closing remarks today that all defendants except Grigore should be sentenced to death. However, the Soviet court does not act out of revenge or cruelty, but if the court believes that it is necessary to implement the strictest measures against the criminals, then do not hesitate. (National News Agency, Moscow, 15th)</p>
<h3>British Independent Labour Party Sympathizes with Russia British</h3>
<p>The British Independent Labour Party's annual conference passed a resolution stating that the party fully sympathizes with Soviet Russia. If the British-Russian conflict escalates into open hostility, it will declare a general strike to respond. Party leader Brockway declared that "Our party's open support for Soviet Russia and opposition to the British government under the current circumstances should be known to the world. We know that this attitude is not unique to our party, and we must strive to unite workers all over the world and resist the threat of war by all means and take the opportunity to overthrow the government and the capitalism it represents." The conference also unanimously passed a resolution opposing the police's tyrannical actions against unemployed workers. (Havas News Agency, London, 17th)</p>
<h3>Yesterday's Continued Trial Proceedings</h3>
<p>The Wikers Company Technicians Case Continued This Morning, Prosecutor Vyshinsky Presented the Case, As Sharp As Before, While Several English Defendants Gradually Showed Signs of Excessive Agitation and Mental Exhaustion. The Prosecutor Spoke in Detail About the Shortcomings of the Wikers Machines, Hoping to Prove That the Damage to the Machines They Sent Was Purely Due to Sabotage. The Prosecutor Also Praised MacDonald's Courage in Admitting His Guilt, Saying That If These People Could Speak Honestly, Then MacDonald Could Be Said to Be Honest, and Also Brave, Much Braver Than the Soldier Thornton Who Served in the Mesopotamian Theater. The Prosecutor Also Pointed Out That the South African Technician Krushny Deliberately Ignored the Poor Performance of the Second Turbine, Saying That This Showed Krushny's Lack of Attention to Whether the Motor's Work Was Good or Bad. These Saboteurs Had Their Five-Year Plan in the Main Plant Supplying Electricity to the Moscow Area, and the Sabotage Began in 1928, Which Is Now the Fifth Year. Among the Defendants, There Is One Whose Crimes I Have Not Yet Been Able to Determine, and I Will Speak About It Again When I Bring Charges in the Future, He Said. This Statement Refers to Wikers Company Technician Gregory, Who Is Also Accused of Being a Saboteur and Engaging in Economic, Military, and Civil Espionage. The Prosecutor Also Said That the Crimes of the Other Defendants Are True, and I Have Photographs to Prove It. MacDonald Is an Experienced Detective, More Agile Than Others. He Was Discovered While Implementing Sabotage. The Information He Collected Has No Beneficial Relationship With the Wikers Company, He Said.

<h3>"Puppet State" and the Chinese Eastern Railway</h3>
<p>Russo-Puppet Negotiations Have No Results</p>
<p>Guerrillas Active, Train Derailment</p>
<p>The Zi Lin Bao Harbin Dispatch of March 31st States That Railway Issues Are Currently Widely Discussed Among the People of Harbin, and Various Newspapers Are Also Reporting on This Matter in Lengthy Articles. The Final Outcome Cannot Be Predicted, So People Are Extremely Nervous. According to Reports Today, Last Week Railway Police Discovered Four Locomotives That Were Planning to Enter Russian Territory.</p>
<p>They Quickly Took Measures to Make Them Fall Into a Sidetrack to Avoid Driving Out of Manchuria. The Chinese Eastern Railway Ordered the Railway Police to Arrest Employees Who Interfered With the Locomotive's Actions. One of the Locomotives Was Blocked in Manzhouli, and the Five Russian Employees in the Car Were All Arrested and Escorted to Harbin. The "Manchukuo" Government Now Insists That It Is Illegal for Cars Traveling From West to East to Pass Through the Chinese Eastern Railway Route and Will Strictly Prohibit It. As for the Arrangement for the Chinese Eastern Railway and the Ussuri Railway to Exchange Trains in the East, the "Manchukuo" Authorities Do Not Want to Interfere, but Each Time the Ussuri Railway Should Hand Over Equally Good Cars to the Chinese Eastern Railway. The Requirements Put Forward by the Manzhouli Authorities Have Not Yet Been Answered by Kusnietsov, the Deputy Director of the Chinese Eastern Railway, and Instead, He Has Lodged a Serious Protest Due to the Recent Banditry in the Eastern Section, With One Passenger Train and One Freight Train Derailing One After Another. This Morning, Harbin Received News That a Passenger Train From Vladivostok to Harbin Derailded Near Hailin, Killing and Injuring Many Passengers. At the Same Time, Japanese Newspapers Also Claimed That Thousands of Bandits Were Gathered Near Five Stations, So Train Travel Is Very Dangerous.</p>
<p>The Issue of Soviet Goods Passing Through Manchuria From West to East and the Issue of Soviet Locomotives and Freight Cars Shipped From the Chinese Eastern Railway Last Year That Have Not Yet Been Returned Have Now Gradually Become Intense. The "Manchukuo" Director General of the Chinese Eastern Railway Has Repeatedly Lodged Protests With the Soviet Deputy Director General, But Has Not Received a Single Response. Therefore, Morita, the Japanese Vice Minister of Communications of "Manchukuo," Has Led Two Japanese Members to Harbin to Discuss the Issue With the Soviets. "Manchukuo" Representatives Have Met With the Russian Board of Directors Several Times, But With No Results. The Soviet Deputy Director General Only Said That He Had Reported the Matter to the Moscow Government. According to Soviet Practices, Goods Are Transported From Manzhouli Through the Chinese Eastern Railway to the Maritime Provinces. Soviet Manufactured Products Are All Government Monopolies, So These Goods Are Actually Owned by the Government. The Freight Is Generally Not Paid in Cash, but Only Entered Into the Company's Account as a Debt Owed by the Soviet Government, Which Has Reached 2 Million Gold Rubles Today. There Is Also an Account Book in the Company for Transactions With the Chinese Government. The Chinese Government Generally Does Not Pay Freight for Transporting Goods and Troops, but Instead Leaves the Debt in the Account. The Soviet Government Believes That the Soviet Union Has the Inherent Right to Do As the Chinese Government Does, So That the Debts on Both Sides Can Be Offset When They Are Equal in the Future. However, the "Manchukuo" Authorities Claim That There Are No Such Regulations for Transporting Goods in the Contract Between the Two Sides, So They Intend to Prohibit It. As for the Freight Cars That the Soviet Government Shipped Into Russian Territory Last Year, It Is Said That the Chinese Eastern Railway Did Not Pay for These Freight Cars. During the European War, the Allied Powers Purchased Many Goods in the United States and Transported Them to Vladivostok, and Then Shipped Them to Russia in Europe Via Manchuria. Among Them Was a Large Batch of Freight Cars Purchased by the British Government and Handed Over to the Russian Government, Which Were Disassembled and Transported to Harbin for Delivery, So That They Could Be Assembled in the Chinese Eastern Railway Factory. People Still Living in Harbin Can Prove This. Later, Due to the Russian Revolution, They Were Never Handed Over to the Russian Government, So the Soviet Government Should Now Inherit Them. The "Manchukuo" Authorities Claim That All of the Freight Cars of the Chinese Eastern Railway Are the Property of the Company. Yesterday, When Representatives of the "Manchukuo" Ministry of Communications Met With Soviet Deputy Director General Kusnietsov, Kusnietsov Said That All Freight Cars Belonging to the Chinese Eastern Railway Should Be Returned, But Those That the Soviet Government Believed Did Not Belong to the Chinese Eastern Railway Are Not Included. According to Russian Newspaper Reports, This Issue Is Now Extremely Difficult, But It Will Not Cause the Terrible Situation of Triggering a War, as Some Newspapers Have Said. Although There Have Been Rumors of a Mutiny in Siberia Recently, the Soviet Government Is Still Making Full Military Preparations for the Manchurian Issue to Prevent a Break. In Addition, Most of the Japanese Troops in Northern Manchuria Have Been Transferred to Jehol for Combat, and the Remaining Forces Are Very Weak. Starting a War at This Time Is the Most Foolish Thing to Do. Therefore, It Is Expected That Both Sides Can Eventually Negotiate a Satisfactory Solution.</p>
<p>Another Train Derailment Occurred on the Eastern Section of the Chinese Eastern Railway This Morning. This Proves That the Former Volunteer Army in That Area Has Now Reassembled and Is Trying to Hinder Railway Transportation and Harm Japanese Troops in Various Ways. After the Train Derailded, the Volunteer Army Immediately Opened Fire, Bombarding the Japanese Guards, Killing Three and Seriously Wounding Five. However, None of the Passengers Were Injured. The Driver Also Died Instantly Due to the Overturn of the Car. Soon After, the Following Train Arrived and Was Also Fiercely Bombarded. The Volunteer Army Obviously Thought That There Must Be Many Japanese People on Board. According to Railway Bureau Officials, Almost All of the Passenger Cars Were Destroyed in This Accident, and the Locomotive Also Needs Major Repairs. The Track Has Been Severely Damaged and Also Needs Three Days of Repairs. For the Sake of Caution, the Railway Bureau Has Now Suspended Night Passenger Trains.</p>
<h3>Cai Tingkai Visits Guangdong Again</h3>
<p>Cai Talks About His Willingness to Be in the Vanguard of the Anti-Japanese War</p>
<p>And Urges Chen Jitang to Take Full Responsibility for Suppressing the Communists</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: After the 19th Route Army Entered Guangdong From Fujian's Dongjiang, They Took the Road Through Meixian, Xingning, and Longchuan, and Turned Into Wengyuan in Beijiang, Gathering in a Certain Place in Beijiang to Await Orders to Go North. Cai Tingkai, Commander-in-Chief of the 19th Route Army, Also Came to Guangdong From Fujian to Negotiate Departure Matters With the Guangdong Authorities. He Arrived in Hong Kong From Fujian by Ship on the 9th, Stayed in Hong Kong for One Day, and Negotiated With Politicians Living in Hong Kong. On the Afternoon of the 11th, He Took the Guangzhou-Kowloon Express to the Province Again. Dozens of Military and Political Figures Went to the Station to Welcome Him. After Cai Got Off the Train, He Accompanied Xiang Hanping, Commander of the Second Army, and Tan Qixiu, Commander of the 19th Brigade, to the Headquarters of the First Group Army to Visit Chen Jitang and Discuss the Great Plan of Resisting Japan and Suppressing the Communists. Chen Had Already Been Waiting at the Headquarters. Central Committee Members From the Southwest and Generals From the First Group Army Were All Present. They Had a Very Pleasant Conversation. Chen Also Held a Banquet at Headquarters to Welcome Cai. They Briefly Discussed the Current Situation During the Banquet and Dispersed With Great Enjoyment. According to Cai, Recent External Aggression and Internal Troubles Are Approaching. Both Japan and the Communists Are Enough to Destroy Us. There Is No Distinction Between Light and Heavy. We Should Deal With Them at the Same Time. Resisting Japan Is the Natural Duty of Soldiers. This Time Guangdong and Fujian Sent Troops. It Is Rumored That I Am Serving as the Commander-in-Chief, But I Think It Is Not Necessary to Pay Attention to the Name. I Am Only Determined to Resist Japan. Moreover, Fighting With Japan Is My Long-Cherished Wish. No Matter What the Name Is, I Am Happy to Take Responsibility and Be in the Vanguard for the Party and the Country. The Issue of Suppressing the Communists Is Also an Urgent Matter at Present. Chairman Chiang Recently Entered Jiangxi to Command the Suppression of the Communists and Telegraphically Instructed Me to Return to Guangdong and Urge Commander-in-Chief Bonan (Chen Jitang) to Take Full Responsibility for Suppressing the Communists in Jiangxi Province. The Central Government Will Give Him the Title of Commander-in-Chief or Commander-in-Chief of the Suppression of the Communists to Take Full Responsibility for the Suppression of the Communists in Jiangxi Province. However, When Talking About It Hasty, Bonan Did Not Make Any Formal Statement. It Is Probably Still Under Consideration Before He Can Agree. Recently, Some People Said That I Would Return to Guangdong to Attend the National Defense Committee and Negotiate the Resistance Against Japan. I Hope the Name Is Self-Explanatory. The National Defense Committee Is an Agency for Planning National Defense, Which Is Completely Different From Military Actions. The Measures of the Committee Depend on the Economy. Now That Most of the Items Have Been Decided, There Is No Need for the National Defense Committee to Hold a Meeting, and So On. On the 12th, the Southwest Political Affairs Council Held an Emergency Meeting and Invited Cai to Attend. Li Zongren Also Attended From the Sanatorium, Supported by Illness. They Discussed the Two Major Plans of Resisting Japan and Suppressing the Communists. The Meeting Lasted From 11:00 AM to 1:00 PM. The Security Was Extremely Tight, and the Details Are Not Known. (April 13th)</p>
<h3>Chen Duxiu Submits a Document to the High Court</h3>
<p>Claims No Attempt to Usurp the Republic of China</p>
<p>Suzhou Correspondence: Chen Duxiu and Others Are Currently Being Tried by Members of the High Court in Nanjing. Recently, Chen Personally Wrote a Statement and Submitted It to the High Court. The Statement Is Thousands of Words Long. The Content First States That His Revolution Over the Past 30 Years Has Been to Improve China. Second, the Purpose of Organizing the Communist Party Is to Resist Imperialism to Complete China's Independence, Resist Warlords and Bureaucrats to Realize National Unification, Improve the Lives of Farmers and Workers, and Realize the Thoroughly Democratic National Legislative Conference. He Also Declares That the Trotskyites Have Nothing to Do With the Jiangxi and Other Historical Factions. The Communist Party Exists in Various European and American Countries and Cannot Be Immediately Regarded as a Criminal. I (Chen Refers to Himself) Have No Intention to Usurp the Republic of China for the Party and the Country Now and in the Future. All Purposes and Actions Are to Support the Republic of China and Cannot Be Regarded as Harming the Republic of China. Otherwise, What Should Be Interpreted as the So-Called Republic of China? Finally, He Says That If the Court Does Not Completely Obey Special Forces, If It Still Thinks of Maintaining Some Judicial Independence Internally and Externally, It Should Unhesitatingly Declare Him Not Guilty and Order the Government to Pay Compensation for His Economic and Health Losses During His Detention. (April 17th)</p>

<h3>Textile Mills Implement Work Reduction</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese Textile Mills Association Believes That the Price of Yarn Has Fallen Sharply, Stockpiles Have Accumulated, and Sales Have Been Stagnant, Which Has Had a Great Impact on the Future of the Textile Industry. Therefore, in Order to Reduce Production and Reverse the Decline, Work Reduction Measures Were Formulated, and Members Were Sent From the Shanghai Mills Association to Various Places to Urge and Assist in the Implementation. The Work Reduction Measures Stipulate That Work Will Be Suspended for Eight Days Each Month (Originally Four Days), and Daily Working Hours Will Also Be Shortened. However, This County Is a Developed Area for Industry and Commerce. There Are a Total of Seven Textile Mills, With More Than 30,000 Male and Female Workers. If Work Is Reduced Once, It May Be Related to the Livelihood of the Workers. Moreover, Most of the Textile Mills in This County Also Operate Weaving, and Most of the Cotton Yarn Produced Is Woven Into Cloth. Therefore, the Impact of the Sharp Drop in Yarn Prices Is Still Small. Therefore, Each Factory Has Been Hesitant to Implement It. Recently, Qingfeng Textile Mill in Zhou Shanbang Has Been the First to Implement Work Reduction Since the Previous Day, and Zhenxin Textile Mill in Taibaodun Will Also Implement Work Reduction This Week. However, Shenxin No. 3 Mill and Changxin Dyeing and Weaving Mill Have Not Yet Decided.</p>

<h3>Chairman's Speech</h3>
<p>Chairman Wang Xiaolai stood up and gave a farewell speech, the original text of which is of great importance.</p>
<p>A brief summary is recorded as follows: Minister Song, in his capacity as Deputy Dean of the Executive Yuan and concurrently Minister of Finance, left the country to participate in the World Economic Conference convened in Washington amidst the urgent situation. Our association, in view of the importance of this mission, is hosting this reception today to express our sincerity and expectations. Considering the current situation in our country, the so-called war debt issue and tariff issue, which are central to the economic conference, either have no direct relevance to our country, or are of secondary importance. The convening of this US economic conference has not invited even second and third-rate European countries, while our country, with its relatively shallow Far East ties and busy dealing with foreign troubles, is invited to the conference along with major European countries. This shows that the economic conference is a facade, and the content is certainly not so simple. The Japanese have seen through this and have made preliminary informal indications that the conference should not involve the Manchurian issue. However, the reason why the Japanese have been able to act wantonly in the Far East, occupying the four provinces and attacking Ludong, is that Europe and the United States are weakened by worker unemployment and war debt payment issues, and cannot effectively sanction Japan. Therefore, Japan sees this time as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Therefore, if Europe and the United States want to interfere with Japan's atrocities, they must first adjust their internal affairs and gradually restore their vitality before taking effective action. Our country, as Europe and the United States' largest market in the Far East, needs them in this incident, and they also need us. We should do our best within the possible range to help alleviate the economic downturn in Europe and the United States, so that the task of this conference can achieve satisfactory results with our efforts, which will also have a positive impact on the Manchurian issue indirectly. This is called working hard here and reaping benefits there. This conference can be called a cadre conference of the great powers, and its importance may be above the Washington Conference of the Nine-Power Treaty in the past. How should our country make a sincere statement to move the world powers, so that they know that the world economic issue</p>
<p>cannot be separated from the Chinese economic issue, and the Chinese economic issue cannot be separated from the Northeast issue, so that they have a thorough understanding to change their Far East policy. This speech is far more effective than a public proposal. This is what we expect from Minister Song. Secondly, foreign troubles are increasingly urgent, and the task is heavy and arduous. It is up to you. The departure is imminent. We respectfully raise a glass to wish this trip success.</p>
<h3>Representatives' Speeches</h3>
<p>Representatives from various groups also delivered speeches in succession. The main points are recorded as follows: (1) Shi Liangcai said, "This World Economic Conference is extremely important. With Minister Song's position and reputation among friendly countries, it is natural that Minister Song should go in person. Therefore, at this farewell party, I hope that Minister Song can solve the domestic depression with fresh air after attending, and hope to achieve economic sanctions against Japan," etc. (2) Li Fusun briefly described the process of Minister Song's decision to attend the World Economic Conference, and then stated that with Minister Song's resolute spirit of abolishing the tael and changing the currency, he will surely be able to win many benefits after attending, and hopes that after returning to China, our country's economy and finance can open up a new life, or even find a solution to the Far East issue," etc. (3) Yu Qiaqing said, "China is now failing everywhere and being oppressed by others. If we can fight our way out of the economy, we can also defeat the enemy. After consolidating the economy, and then helping it with military force, there is no one who cannot win. Japan is only one-tenth of China, but it is called strong because it relies entirely on paper money and on the unity of its entire country. Therefore, if our country can unite and resist, it will surely have an advantage one day. Therefore, this time Minister Song is going to the United States to attend, on the one hand, hoping that the people of the whole country will cooperate with the government, and on the other hand, hoping that Minister Song can work hard for the country," etc. (4) Bei Songsun said, "This time I am following Minister Song abroad, as if in the position of a staff officer. In the past, our government's representatives to foreign countries have never had our merchants participate, but this time Minister Song actually came to find merchants, which shows that he is open-minded and can think for the people. The Minister of Finance has always been dedicated to raising funds, but Minister Song not only pays attention to handling finances, but also attaches great importance to the overall economic problem in the country. This is because he knows that the economic problem is actually the 'people's livelihood' mentioned by the Premier. The world's economic depression has now reached its extreme. At the convening of the China conference, our country must of course contribute its opinions to the conference, and it is very likely that the world will pay attention. Therefore, this conference is directly related to our industry and commerce. Minister Song invited me to participate and be consulted, and I am very willing to follow and contribute. However, I am afraid that my talents are limited, and there are many talented and knowledgeable people in our industrial and commercial circles. I am deeply afraid of failing to meet expectations," etc.</p>
<h3>Mr. Song's Reply</h3>
<p>After the representatives of various groups finished speaking, Minister Song stood up and replied, "I am very grateful to the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Money Trade Association, and the Local Cooperation Association for their hospitality and farewell today. Mr. Li Fusun has just described the process of my decision to attend the Washington World Economic Conference.</p>
<p>However, when the United States invited our country, I was not prepared to attend because of the increasingly urgent internal and external troubles. After repeated urging from various parties and careful consideration, I felt that although this World Economic Conference is not directly related to the Far East issue, because of the mutual relationship and the entire world economic issue, I immediately decided to participate. In order to go to the United States quickly, I decided to leave tomorrow. As far as our country's current economy is concerned, the rural areas are bankrupt, commerce is declining, and currency is flowing into the cities, especially Shanghai. Productivity is declining day by day.</p>
<p>The reasons for this are the Yangtze River flood, the scourge of the Communist bandits, and Japan's economic invasion of our markets and military occupation of our four eastern provinces. These three points are all special difficulties that have arisen in our country as a result. However, the economic recession is a common phenomenon all over the world. It is not only our country that is like this. Even the United States, which is known as wealthy, is also unavoidable. Unemployed workers account for more than 15 million. In terms of population ratio, if you include their family members, the unemployed account for one-third. The United States is like this, and other countries can be imagined. Therefore, if we want to solve the domestic economic difficulties now, it is definitely not something that individual forces can do. If we build the Great Wall to close ourselves off, we must unite with all countries in the world to have hope. In the past, countries also tried to build the Great Wall in economic issues,</p>
<p>such as raising tariff barriers. Now they have realized that this is not the case. The central government sent me to attend this time because it wants to solve the domestic economic difficulties and must solve them together with the whole world. However, this trip is definitely not to ask for help, because China has a vast land and a population of 400 million, which is the world's largest market and will make a great contribution to the world in saving and solving the economic crisis. We can meet with all countries frankly, exchange opinions, and discuss solutions. Now that Japan is so barbaric, if our country only focuses on military force and does not work hard on the economy,</p>
<p>it is a mistake. A country is like a human body. It is definitely not healthy or fearless just by relying on the strength of one right arm. The entire body's functions must be fully utilized to be effective. Therefore, although this is an economic issue, it is also a national issue and a worldwide issue. Today, those who are seeing me off are all the elites from all walks of life. In the past, they have assisted me and overcome difficulties together.</p>
<p>I am grateful for their kindness, not only personally. After I board the ship tomorrow, I will stand in the position of the people. Therefore, although I am representing the government this time, I am also representing the people.</p>
<p>Whether this trip can live up to its mission depends entirely on the supervision and guidance of the government and the people. Therefore, after arriving in the United States, I hope to have telegrams to contribute opinions at any time and implement supervision. I will also report the detailed situation to you at any time." The meeting adjourned at about 6:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Wang Jingwei Returned to Nanjing Last Night</h3>
<p>Issued a Written Responsible Speech Before Leaving</p>
<p>Said that the Southwest Opposes the Entire Conference and is Difficult to Understand</p>
<p>Not Suppressing the Communist Bandits is Equivalent to Not Resisting Japan</p>
<p>Mr. Wang returned to Nanjing on the 11:30 PM express train last night because he had to attend today's administrative meeting. The railway bureau specially attached a flower car for Mr. Wang to ride in. Mr. Wang arrived at the station at 10:45 PM and went to bed because his back was hurting.</p>
<p>In addition to his wife, Ms. Chen Bijun, those who traveled with him included Zeng Zhongming, Chen Gongbo, Jiao Yitang, Wang Zhengting, and Liu Ruiheng.</p>
<p>In addition, Ms. Soong Meiling, the wife of Chairman Jiang of the Military Affairs Commission, also went to Nanjing by night train last night. Minister of Railways Gu Mengyu is scheduled to return to Nanjing by early train this morning.</p>
<p>Mr. Wang issued a written statement yesterday, stating: (Q) The Southwest Central Committee members telegraphed on a cold day, still opposing the Central Committee's convening of a temporary national representative conference to discuss and decide on the early convening of the National Assembly. What are your thoughts on this? (A) The Southwest Central Committee members seem to have forgotten two things. First, the Fifth National Congress, according to the party constitution, must be held in November of this year. Now, holding a temporary national representative conference on July 1 is only a few months earlier. Second, the National Assembly, according to the decision of the Third Plenary Session, should be convened in April of the 24th year. Now, the so-called early convening is only a year and a half earlier. The Central Standing Committee, in view of the urgent national crisis, advocates early convening and has sufficient reasons, while their opposition seems not only to oppose early convening, but directly to oppose the convening of the National Congress and the National Assembly. It can be said that it is difficult to understand the interpreter.</p>
<p>(Q) Chairman Jiang's speech in Nanchang stated that during this serious period of suppressing the Communist bandits, advocating resistance against Japan should be strictly dealt with, which has aroused doubts from the outside world. What do you think, sir? (A) We must not take Chairman Jiang's speech out of context. Now, the task of the troops in North China is to resist Japan.</p>
<p>The task of the troops in Jiangxi is to suppress the Communist bandits. Both are contributing to the country and are equally important. However, if the troops in Jiangxi forget the current task of suppressing the Communist bandits and volunteer to resist Japan, it is tantamount to giving the Communist Party an opportunity to take advantage of. Therefore, Chairman Jiang cannot but repeatedly admonish them. Even more so, some people advocate that the troops suppressing the Communist bandits should be moved to resist Japan. Little do they know that the Communist bandits are still rioting in Jiangxi and other places during the serious national crisis.</p>
<p>This is tantamount to acting as an accomplice to the tiger. From this point of view, suppressing the Communist bandits is resisting Japan, and not suppressing the Communist bandits is equivalent to not resisting Japan. We must understand this point so that we do not misunderstand Chairman Jiang's speech.</p>
<h3>Legal Rights and Administrative Integrity in Concessions</h3>
<p>The Chinese Taxpayers Association Telegraphed the Authorities to Pay Attention</p>
<p>Preventing Concessions From Seizing Factory Management Rights</p>
<p>The Shanghai Concession Chinese Taxpayers Association telegraphed Minister Luo of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Minister Luo of the Ministry of Judicial Administration, and Minister Chen of the Ministry of Industry in Nanjing yesterday, (the title is omitted) stating: "Labor laws and regulations are laws that are enforced in our country's territory. No local agency may undermine them. Regardless of who has the police power in Shanghai, the management and inspection are solely the responsibility of the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau from an administrative system perspective. The May 30th Massacre in the 14th year of the Republic of China, which opposed the Public Concession's Municipal Council's proposed amendment to Article 34 of the bylaws to include exchange printing and child labor, was also the biggest explosive. It has been nearly eight years since then, and our country's labor laws and regulations have been officially promulgated and implemented. However, the Municipal Council is actually trying to bring up the old matter again, planning to hold a special meeting on April 19, taking advantage of the annual meeting of taxpayers, to amend Article 34 of the bylaws in order to add the phrase "who has or occupies or opens a factory or workshop or engages in industry" under the phrase "within this boundary," so as to seize the power granted by the Central Government to the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau,</p>
<p>and sever or undermine the integrity of our laws and regulations. The association did not dare to ignore the previous facts and current laws and regulations, and on April 12, at the representative conference of more than 96% of the residents within the boundary, it raised the case of the Municipal Council's proposed management of factories within the boundary. It was unanimously resolved, "According to the opinion of this conference, most of the workers in the factories in the Public Concession are our Chinese workers. If factory management and other laws and regulations are established in addition to the labor laws and regulations promulgated by our government, it will be detrimental to our country's sovereignty. Therefore, it is specially resolved that any motion or land charter and or amendment to the bylaws that grants the Municipal Council the power to manage, inspect, and or supervise all factories within the boundary will not be agreed to." The matter concerns the integrity of our country's legal rights and administration. It is reasonable to include a copy of the gazette, record the case, and telegraphically report it. Please investigate and act accordingly for the sake of the public. Chairman Wang Xiaolai and Xu Jilong of the Shanghai Concession Chinese Taxpayers Association respectfully submit this telegram."</p>
<h3>The Russian Ambassador is Scheduled to Arrive in Shanghai</h3>
<p>On the 23rd</p>
<p>The Great American Evening News said, "According to reliable sources, the newly appointed Soviet Russian Ambassador to China, Bogomolov, will arrive in Shanghai on the Asama Maru from Kobe. It is expected that he will arrive at the port on April 23. It is reported that the Chinese authorities in this port are preparing to welcome him, but the welcome procedures have not yet been determined. In addition, several Soviet Russian commercial representatives and semi-official representatives stationed in Shanghai will also go to Jianggan to meet him. It is said that the ambassador is taking a route through Japan to China. No one knows the purpose of his visit to Tokyo. It is generally believed that it will not have any formal meaning, and the relations between Russia and Japan are tense now. The ambassador may not have a meeting with the Tokyo authorities."</p>
<h3>Yarn Merchants Selling Japanese Yarn</h3>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Warns the Yarn Trade Association</p>
<p>The New Sound News Agency said, "The Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Yarn Trade Association of this city, stating: 'It has been secretly reported that recently, yarn merchants such as Maochang, Ruixiang, Ruihe, Hemaom Beigongmao, Zhicheng, Baofeng, Zhenyuan, Xingsheng, Yifengxiang, Yitai, Fu Xiangji, Lin Yuanfeng, Zhang Jinji, Tongtaichang, Xingye Company, Maochang, Nangongmao, and various yarn shops in Xujiahui are selling Japanese yarn in large quantities without any scruples. Please find a way to stop them.' The case of economic severance with Japan has been resolved by the members' conference of this association after the September 18th Incident two years ago and notified to all industries to abide by it. Since then, Japanese goods should no longer be imported to show solidarity against the enemy. It is now reported that the industry is still selling Japanese goods as before, which is indeed contrary to the original plan of economic severance with Japan. The association, as a group of the same industry, cannot supervise and dissuade them at any time, and lets them act as they please, which is a loss of the status of the group and subject to criticism. A serious warning should be given. It is appropriate to enclose the original list and letter for investigation and strict prohibition." It is reported that the industry is now gathering to discuss the disposal method.</p>
<h3>American Aviator Doolittle</h3>
<p>Public Performance Today</p>
<p>11:00 AM in the Sky Above the Bund</p>
<p>4:30 PM at Longhua Airport</p>
<p>The Central News Agency said, "The world-renowned American aviator Major Doolittle, in order to give the Chinese people the opportunity to see the actions of modern military aircraft and to arouse the interest of the Chinese people in aviation, will give his first public performance in the sky above the Bund at 11:00 AM today and at Longhua Airport at 4:30 PM this afternoon. Welcome to visit without restriction. The aircraft used by Mr. Doolittle is the latest Curtiss factory Eagle brand 700-horsepower fighter, which is one of the best military aircraft in the world."</p>
<h3>Unscrupulous Merchants Smuggle Japanese Fish and are Detained</h3>
<p>Insane and Madly Pretending to be Domestic Products in an Attempt to Evade Taxes</p>
<p>Customs Detention and Punishment the Enemy Goods Inspection Association Asks for Severe Punishment</p>
<p>A telegram from the Shanghai Times News Agency reported that on the 13th of this month, there was a sand boat with the customs number of 0365 and the name Jinbaoli, the boat owner Zheng Quanliang, (that is, Ahao, according to the investigation of the Municipal Fishermen's Association, the boat had not come to Shanghai before) loaded yellow sand from Xiushan, Ningbo, and came to Shanghai, unloading at the Guangxin Wharf in Yangshupu. It finished unloading on the 14th, and then, at the request of a fishmonger surnamed Wang, it first sailed to Gaoqiao to load ice on the 15th, and then went to Bailonggang, Wusongkou, to smuggle more than 250 dan of small yellow croakers, large yellow croakers, and pomfrets from Japanese fishing boats, and sailed into the 16th Wharf in the early morning of the 17th for sale. The fishermen discovered their treachery, reported it to the Fish Industry Inspection and Enemy Goods Association, and reported it to the Customs. The Customs detained the ship because it falsely claimed to be domestic goods and attempted to evade national taxes (about 1,500 yuan). After investigation, the Fish Industry Inspection and Enemy Goods Association learned that this smuggling of Japanese fish was actually a pre-planned plan by Lu Jintang, the manager of Qiafeng, who was accustomed to doing business with Japanese fresh fish, and Wang Qingtang, a broker. Lu and others induced the unscrupulous merchants with cheap prices, as small yellow croakers have been cheap recently, only five or six yuan per dan, and the import tariff for Japanese ships is four yuan per dan. Therefore, Lu and others were blinded by greed and did everything possible, using this means of tax evasion to make profits. It is said that the unscrupulous merchants are still trying to dredge relations with the Customs, demanding exemption from punishment. The Customs, of course, cannot easily let them go, and the Fish Industry Inspection and Enemy Goods Association has also asked the higher authorities to investigate and punish them. At this time when the national crisis is at its height, the unscrupulous merchants dared to commit such an outrage, which is really insane and madly. It is hateful. Unless they are severely punished, it will not be enough to prevent future offenses.</p>

<h3>Fourth Report on Aviation Fundraising Achievements</h3>
<p>Totaling More Than 88,500 Yuan</p>
<p>The Japanese Danger in North China Requires National Salvation Without Delay</p>
<p>It Has Been Decided to Purchase Twelve Aircraft First to Go North to Resist the Enemy</p>
<p>The Chinese Aviation Association's fundraising team reported the fourth time's achievements yesterday, (the original scheduled date for the fourth report was the 15th, but it was postponed to yesterday due to the Western Spring Festival,) General Team Leader Wu Tiecheng hosted the leaders of the various fundraising teams at 4:00 PM on the ninth floor of the Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA, including Zhang Shouyong, Wang Xiaolai, Jin Liren, Dai Ji, Zheng Xigu, Li Tingan, Wen Hongen, Li Denghui, Tong Xingbai, Wu Xingya, Xu Peihuang, Xi Guansheng, Lin Wojiang, and more than 30 other people. General Team Leader Wu reported that the total achievement this time was 88,545 yuan, one dime, and five cents. Because the situation in North China is becoming more and more dangerous, the Aviation Association has decided to order twelve aircraft first.</p>
<p>Organize a team and go north to resist the enemy. The details are recorded separately as follows:</p>
<h3>Summary of Speeches</h3>
<p>Chairman Wu Tiecheng reported, briefly saying that today is the date for the fourth report on aviation fundraising achievements.</p>
<p>The total is only 88,545 yuan, and the total of the previous three times is less than one million. The distance from the planned goal of two million yuan is still far away, and it has been more than a month and a half since the fundraising began. There are only two weeks left until the end of April. We must redouble our efforts to achieve the goal. Recently, the situation in North China has become increasingly dangerous. Qinhuangdao, Beidaihe, etc. have all fallen into the hands of the enemy. Some people think that the country's affairs have reached this point, and aviation for national salvation is too late and does not help the actual situation. Little do they know that the Japanese's ambition will never be satisfied with just eastern Hebei. Therefore, it is increasingly urgent to establish an air force in the future. The Chinese Aviation Association originally planned to order aircraft after the fundraising in Shanghai ended. Now, because the national situation is critical, it has been decided to order twelve aircraft first, form an aviation team, and hand it over to the government to lead and go north to resist the enemy. Then Tong Xingbai gave a speech, saying that in terms of the fundraising process, those who eagerly donated are mostly from the lower and middle classes, while the wealthy who have huge sums of money are mostly reluctant to give even a hair. Recently, a car driver gathered more than 70 colleagues, each donating five yuan. The amount is indeed small and does not seem to be of much benefit, but the dedication of those who work hard to feed themselves to the country can be seen from this. On the other hand, those who are able to buy cars not only cannot donate to save the country like car drivers, but also often make remarks that confuse people, not exaggerating the enemy's power, saying that aviation for national salvation is of no avail, and even slandering the government, not resisting. Their hearts are really unbearable to ask. Then Li Denghui, Wen Yongshu, and others gave speeches in succession and dispersed.</p>

<h3>Foreign Goods Must Indicate Nationality</h3>
<p>New Regulations Extended</p>
<p>Effective January 1, 1934</p>
<p>The Shanghai Jianghai Customs previously issued a notice stating that from August 1st of this year, all imported foreign goods must be marked with the country of manufacture. It is now further announced that, upon receiving instructions from the government, the implementation of these new regulations will be extended to January 1, 1934.</p>
<h3>News of Crackdown on Inferior Goods on Nanjing Road</h3>
<p>Two Stores Found to be Selling Inferior Goods Officially Announced</p>
<p>Welcome to Secretly Report Any Shortcomings to Help Rectify the Situation</p>
<p>The Nanjing Road Business Association and the First District Branch of the Citizens Association reported that the deadline for advising the few remaining stores selling inferior goods to voluntarily clean up their stock had passed yesterday. A meeting of the original personnel was convened yesterday morning for another secret inspection. Most stores were found to be genuinely pure. A few stores had suspicious items in their stock, and the sources needed to be investigated further to determine right from wrong. However, Tong Chenchang Foreign Goods Store at the eastern end of Bentang Lane and the Chinese store diagonally opposite Wangping Street made verbal promises but continued to openly display and sell large quantities of inferior cotton and wool knitwear. Therefore, the association has jointly decided to formally publish a report in the next day or two, detailing the situation of each store on the road regarding the presence of inferior goods. This will allow consumers to know where to go and what to avoid, with the intention of rewarding good behavior and punishing bad, thereby inspiring patriotism. It is also heard that the association welcomes reports from all sectors at any time, but they must be accompanied by concrete evidence to supplement the shortcomings of the association's inspectors.</p>
<h3>Two Organizations Send Telegram of Condolence to Shang Zhen</h3>
<p>The Municipal Business Association and the Local Association yesterday sent a telegram to Shang Zhen, which read: "To Commander Shang Qiyu: Representative Cheng Qi arrived in Shanghai and reported that your troops recaptured Lengkou after its loss, inflicting heavy casualties on the stubborn enemy and exchanging our flesh and blood for this vital pass. Now, the situation at the border ports is tense again, and Luandong is in danger. The enemy's ambition is burning brightly, and North China is bound to be targeted. We have already lost much land, and how can our territory endure further encroachment? We can only vow to fight to the death and resist for the long term. They have sharp weapons, but we have courage and determination. The will of the people is stronger than metal and stone, and crude weapons can defeat armor and soldiers. Setbacks are temporary, and ultimate victory will still be ours. We, your compatriots, look north to Yanyun and are filled with grief and indignation. We are willing to gather all our strength and vow to provide support. We send our condolences and await news of victory. Shanghai Municipal Business Association, Shanghai Municipal Local Association, respectfully."</p>
<h3>Tian Lin's Troops Recapture Fuxin</h3>
<p>Chen Yaofu's Telegram Arrives in Ping</p>
<p>The Northeast Volunteer Army Support Association received a telegram from Li Shiyong, representative of Feng Zhanhai, which read: "Tian Lin, commander of the 16th Brigade of Feng Zhanhai's 2nd Route Army of the Jilin National Salvation Army, has now led his troops to the Fuxin area on the border of Rehe, joining forces with Liu Zhendong's Vanguard Army. On the 5th of this month, they advanced to Shijiazi and engaged in fierce fighting with the Japanese army. At dawn on the 7th, they occupied Fuxin, capturing over a hundred rifles, one cannon, and many other military supplies. They are continuing to resist the enemy and have sent personnel to report the situation to Tian Lin. Currently, the soldiers at the front lines are fighting fiercely in the enemy's midst, and transportation funds are scarce. Please provide appropriate assistance. Representative Li Shiyong respectfully. "The association also received a telegram from Chen Yaofu, a Shanghai comfort delegation representative, which read: "Yaofu has arrived in Ping and is contacting various parties separately, planning to go to the front lines to offer comfort. Please continue to report. Please send all bills of lading for comfort items as soon as possible. Chen Yaofu respectfully."</p>
<h3>Another Bomb Explodes at Juchang Cotton Cloth Store</h3>
<p>Around 7 PM Last Night Near Bulin Lane</p>
<p>Doors and Windows Shattered, But No One Injured</p>
<p>Juchang Cotton Cloth Store (specializing in wholesale foreign cloth and textile trade), located at No. 140-142 Bulin Lane, west end of Zhengjia Wood Bridge Street in the middle section of Avenue Dubail (Gongguan Road), is a double-fronted store opened by several shareholders, with Ma Yulong from Ningbo serving as a shareholder and manager. Business has been quite prosperous. At around 7 PM yesterday (the 17th), while the shop assistants were having dinner in the inner hall, a bomb suddenly flew in from the middle of the road, causing a loud explosion that shook the neighborhood. Smoke filled the air. Fortunately, there were no customers in the store at the time, and the shop assistants were all in the inner hall. Only several pieces of door and window glass were shattered, and no one was injured. When the patrolling police heard the sound and arrived, the bomber had already disappeared. The head of the French Concession Police Department dispatched Chinese and foreign detectives to investigate, and they collected the bomb fragments from the ground and took them back to the police station pending investigation and the arrest of the bomber.</p>
<h3>Municipal Government to Announce Housing Lease Regulations</h3>
<p>Approved by the Executive Yuan</p>
<p>The city has a vast area, a large population, and expensive housing prices, so residents often have to rent. In order to facilitate residents' housing leases and avoid disputes, the municipal government previously drafted the Shanghai Housing Lease Regulations and submitted them to the Executive Yuan for review. The Executive Yuan entrusted the Ministry of Interior to review the regulations, made some minor revisions, and then resubmitted them to the Executive Yuan. The municipal government received instructions from the Executive Yuan on the morning of the 17th, approving the record. Therefore, the regulations will be announced soon.</p>

<h3>Case of the Assassination of Zhang Zigang</h3>
<p>The Informant Has Joined the Volunteer Army</p>
<p>Chang Lao Jiu Claims He Was Framed</p>
<p>The Interrogation Yielded No Clues</p>
<p>Zhang Zigang from Zhenjiang, also known as Zhang Lao Si, was called down from a rickshaw by four men wearing blue cotton shirts and pants on Yanhai Road in the city on the afternoon of November 9th of last year and shot dead. The informant of the Public Security Bureau's detective team reported the arrest of Chang Lao Jiu and transferred him to the local court. After investigation by the prosecutor, he was prosecuted for murder. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Zhang Peiming opened the court to hear the case. Chang Lao Jiu testified that he did not know Zhang Zigang or Gao Lansheng, and he did not commit the murder. He claimed that the informant Yao A San framed him because he had known a woman three years ago who is now with Yao A San. He said that he went to the Great World amusement park in October of last year and met the woman at a tea house in the Republic Hall. He spoke with her about their past, and Yao A San came and scolded the woman and pointed at him with a cold laugh before leaving. He suspected that this was the reason for the false accusation. Chen Su Fang, the wife of the deceased Zhang Zigang, testified that she currently lives at No. 9 Chuanxin Street, Laobeimen. She said that on the day her husband was killed, he said he was going to Weng Lao Si's house for dinner, but he was killed on the road. She did not know about it. She only found out because the coat had the words "Zhang Zigang" printed on it. She did not know Chang Lao Jiu, and Gao Lansheng was not his teacher. When asked about her previous testimony at the prosecutor's office, she replied that she had not said those things. Yuan Hai Shan testified that he is currently a detective in the Municipal Public Security Bureau's detective team. Dong Mingde did not come today because he was working on a case. The informant Yao A San has joined the Volunteer Army. Yao A San reported to Dong Mingde that the murderer of Zhang Zigang on November 9th was Chang Lao Jiu, who was currently at the Rui Shi Mo auction house. Therefore, Dong Mingde went with him and arrested Chang Lao Jiu and took him to the bureau. He did not know what happened after that. His report was also quite simple and did not explain any details. Lu Rong Lian and Tang A Hu, shopkeepers near the scene of the crime, testified that they heard gunshots but did not come out to see what happened. They did not know who the murderer was. Weng Lao Si testified that he lives on Baiyi Street, Jiumudi. Zhang Zigang was a friend from six or seven years ago. He did not know Gao Lansheng. Zhang Zigang came to his house, but he was not home. He only found out about his death later. The judge stated that the interrogation of the case yielded no clues and ordered further investigation. He then asked the parties to sign off and adjourned the court. The defendant was returned to custody.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Railways' Railroad Freight Exhibition Letter to Merchants and Citizens</h3>
<p>Since the opening of the Railway Freight Exhibition, the number of visitors has been overwhelming, reaching approximately seventy to eighty thousand people. The exhibits are changed daily. Yesterday, Gu Mengyu, Minister of the Ministry of Railways, personally visited the exhibition and gave instructions. Lao Mian, Deputy Director of the Beining Railway Bureau, and the entire student body of the School of Business at Jinan University also visited the exhibition. It is reported that the exhibition has organized lectures to promote cooperation between the railway and businesses, which have been very successful. Yesterday, a letter to merchants and citizens was also released, the main points of which are summarized below: Railroads transport two things: passengers and goods. In terms of importance, freight transport often surpasses passenger transport, as news of railroad freight transport is of great importance to the prosperity or decline of a region. To seek the progress of railroad freight transport, it is necessary to seek the development of agriculture, industry, and commerce along the railway line. And the development of agriculture, industry, and commerce is also dependent on the progress of railroad transport. Therefore, farmers, industrialists, merchants, and the railroad have a close relationship. However, in ordinary times, producers, sellers, and transporters often lack a common way to explore, and there is no way to work together to improve. This is a major obstacle to the development of production. Seeing this, the Ministry of Railways has gathered products from along the railway lines in one place and brought together producers, sellers, and transporters in one hall to eliminate the old barriers and seek future efforts. We will now inform you of the various aspects we should strive for in the future and hope that you will each do your best to achieve them in the shortest possible time. A. Regarding producers: The backwardness of domestic product production technology and the immaturity of management methods are enough to lead to decline and destruction. The way to improve is to seek the technicalization of production methods and the scientification of management methods. B. Regarding sellers: Our country has historically emphasized agriculture over commerce, but commercial operations have flourished. Various stores are either sole proprietorships or partnerships, and their scale is small and their strength is weak. To this day, small-scale commerce remains the backbone of the domestic business community. The disadvantages of small businesses are numerous. One, financial resources are weak, and the ability to collect and distribute is limited. Two, the organization is immature, and management methods are not sophisticated. Three, through repeated buying and selling, the burden on consumers increases. Four, there is a lack of talent, and the vision of the industry is not long-term. Five, the foundation is shallow, and the danger of bankruptcy is worrisome. The efforts that our country's merchants should make in the future are the centralization and cooperation of sales. Centralization increases capacity, and cooperation reduces costs. Its contribution to the development of domestic products is no less than the improvement of production. C. Regarding transporters: The progress of railway transport lies in the improvement of equipment and the innovation of business. In the future, to develop freight transport and promote domestic products, we can only start with improving equipment and innovating business. Now that the exhibition of products from along the railway line has opened, what are your feelings as you browse through it? Try to examine each product and see which ones need to improve production, which ones need to improve sales, and which ones need to improve transportation. And how should we improve them to achieve development? Investigate things and extend knowledge, and it is up to us to plan for ourselves.</p>

<h3>Citizens of the Six Districts of the County Petition to Reject the Auction of Public Property</h3>
<p>Li Zuyou, a citizen of the first district of Shanghai County, Liu Donghai of the second district, Chen Zhen of the third district, Yao Huiquan of the fourth district, Qin Xitian of the fifth district, and Yang Weigan of the sixth district, have submitted a special petition to the Jiangsu Provincial Government, the Finance Department, the Civil Affairs Department, and the Shanghai County Government to reject the auction of real estate. The original text is recorded below: The petition is for the preservation of public property accumulated for disaster relief, which is prohibited from being transferred according to regulations, in order to maintain disaster relief policies and comply with the wishes of the people. The Shanghai County grain reserve fund originated in the sixth year of the Tongzhi era of the Qing Dynasty. Money was collected per mu of land, and even the poorest widows and orphans were not spared, with every sheng and he accounted for. Even households without heirs and barren graves were guaranteed and compensated to meet the quota. Therefore, it was stipulated that no matter what important public matter, it could not be transferred. The right to manage, allocate, and dispose of everything belonged entirely to the local area. During the Yuzhen relief efforts in the Guangxu era, provincial officials borrowed surplus interest twice, which was then repaid with interest within one or two years. The enactment of such strict laws concerning disaster relief funds, which are related to the lives of the people, was a long-term plan for our local area, and our local people should abide by it forever. However, in recent years, there has suddenly been talk of dividing the city and county and dividing the property, and the appraisal committee has created the idea of equally dividing the value of the property. These intentions to destroy are shocking. If the price is already fixed, it can be divided into sections and divided equally according to the price. Even if there are slight differences in the amount of houses, it can be compensated with cash. Why is it necessary to cut the feet to fit the shoes and lightly speak of selling the property? It can be seen that there is no reason for this. Last year in September, city and county citizens Yao Wen and others detailed the history of grain, money, and property reserves, the dangers of money reserves, and the convenience of property protection, and petitioned for the suspension of the auction. I believe that this has been understood. The citizens are speaking only from the perspective of the county, which has a small territory, barren land, and poor people. We fear that the material resources in the east of the county will become more difficult, the land prices will fall,</p>
<p>The income will decrease, the expenditure will become tighter, and the bankruptcy of farmers will become a reality. Now, we are lightly throwing away the houses accumulated by the blood and sweat of our people for more than 60 years. If we encounter floods and droughts and need immediate relief, we will be at a loss and increase the worries of the officials. Therefore, we dare to base our request on the old regulations and convey the public opinion. We earnestly request that the auction be rejected and that the county fully preserve 37% of the price appraised by the appraisal committee, so that we can prepare for leanness in times of plenty and the locality will have something to rely on. We earnestly request that this be adopted and implemented for the public good. Furthermore, the rice merchants in Shanghai have recently distributed the rice donation to the county, so the cost of building warehouses has already been covered. In the future, the rice merchants will continuously supply rice, and the county will continuously sell grain. With full warehouses, we can be sure of success. The annual rent of the public property should be stored according to regulations or used to relieve the poor, which seems to be in line with both the Ministry's orders and the sentiments of the people.

<h3>Points to Note for Users After Shanghai Telephone Bureau Activates Automatic Telephones</h3>
<p>Since the Ministry of Communications' Shanghai Telephone Bureau activated the automatic telephone at midnight on April 15, the sound has been clear and the performance has been excellent. Even calls to Nanjing have been quite satisfactory. According to the Bureau, there have been no difficulties since the activation, but users are still unclear about the use of the automatic telephone, which has caused slight damage to the equipment, complicated procedures, and affected other users. However, this kind of error is unavoidable at the beginning of automatic telephone service. For example, to call the concession, you must first dial 0 and wait for the operator to answer before reporting the required number and your own number to complete the call. To make a long-distance call, first dial 40 and then wait for connection, and do not stray far from the telephone. It is hoped that all users will pay attention to this to avoid causing too much trouble for the Bureau.</p>
<h3>Increased Telephone Charges for Chinese Areas Using Automatic Telephones</h3>

<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Land Committee</h3>
<p>All Chinese Committee Members Elected</p>
<p>Feng Bingnan, Representative of Chinese Property Owners</p>
<p>Chen Tingrui, Representative of Chinese Taxpayers</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council Land Committee stated that the committee originally consisted of three Western members. Following negotiations by the Municipal Government and the Chinese Taxpayers' Association, two Chinese members were added to represent Chinese taxpayers and Chinese property owners, respectively. The Chinese Taxpayers' Association elected Chen Tingrui at its 12th First Representative Assembly on the 12th of this month to serve on the Shanghai Municipal Council Land Committee for the years 1933-1934 (representing Chinese taxpayers). The Real Estate Association held a temporary members' meeting yesterday at 5:00 PM, chaired by Huang Yanfang. As a result of the election, Feng Bingnan was elected to serve on the Shanghai Municipal Council Land Committee for the years 1933-1934, representing Chinese property owners.</p>
<h3>Pickled Meat and Ham Industries</h3>
<p>Petition Against Seizure of Goods</p>
<p>Over Two Hundred Representatives Present Eloquent Plea to Shanghai Chamber of Commerce</p>
<p>Chairman Wang Xiaolai Acknowledges Request and Promises to Negotiate</p>
<p>Over two hundred representatives from the local pickled meat and ham industries conducted a large-scale petition to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce yesterday at 2:00 PM, demanding the revocation of inspection measures and the release of seized goods. They submitted a petition, which was first received by General Secretary Zheng Chengqing. Later, Chairman Wang Xiaolai came out to meet them. Representatives Xu Renming, Lu Defu, Cai Xiaohe, Wu Chenhu, Zhang Ziyuan, Wang Tingsheng, Wang Mingdeng, and others eloquently presented their reasons for demanding the revocation of inspections and addressing the seizure of goods, requesting that the Chamber of Commerce vigorously negotiate on their behalf. Chairman Wang acknowledged their request and spoke to the two hundred industry representatives, promising to discuss the issue of seized goods with Mayor Wu. Due to prior commitments in Hangzhou, he indicated that further discussion regarding the fundamental revocation of inspections would be necessary later. The industry representatives, satisfied with Chairman Wang's commitment to address the seized goods issue first, expressed their contentment and departed. The petition is reproduced below: Respectfully presented, concerning the inspection of pickled meat and ham, we are grateful that your association has twice telegraphed the Executive Yuan, requesting a directive for its revocation. Half a month has passed with no news. Goods detained in Shanghai, at the South Station and along the river, are valued at over 150,000 to 160,000 yuan. The losses are immeasurable. Further delay will result in complete ruin. Moreover, the inspection issue was previously addressed by the Ministry of Industry, which ordered its cessation last year, and the Executive Yuan issued an order for its revocation. Now, the Public Health Bureau openly applies coercive measures, claiming to have a mandate from the Yuan. If true, the previous orders are rendered meaningless. If Shanghai can use inspections as a pretext for imposing fees, will other locations follow suit? This requires a clear statement from the authorities. Otherwise, the benefit of eliminating the likin tax last year will be overshadowed by the burden of harsh taxes this year. The current scale of seized goods poses an imminent danger and incalculable losses. For the past half-month, despite repeated appeals by your association on behalf of the industry and expressions of discontent, along with considerable criticism from the press, the authorities have turned a deaf ear, allowing the Public Health Bureau to act with impunity. In Shanghai, where all eyes are watching, right and wrong are self-evident. However, for merchants, the detained goods are a matter of life and death. Initially, we hoped for legal redress and patiently awaited a resolution. Now, the matter is practically shelved, with no prospect of retrieval. In such circumstances, the entire industry faces imminent bankruptcy. Driven by desperation, we reiterate our petition, earnestly requesting that your association, upholding its position of leading merchants and safeguarding commerce, vigorously negotiate with the Public Health Bureau to release all detained goods without delay. If a resolution cannot be reached within three days, we, disregarding the oppressive policies that disregard the people's livelihood, will resolve to take matters into our own hands and retrieve the goods ourselves. Should the Public Health Bureau fail to understand, we are prepared to face any sacrifice, regardless of the consequences. The situation is urgent. We apologize for the blunt language and earnestly implore your kind consideration.</p>
<h3>Fresh Fish Industry</h3>
<p>Meeting Held Yesterday Regarding Construction Fees</p>
<p>Resolution Passed to Notify Industry Colleagues to Collect Fees Uniformly</p>
<p>Navy Allocates Two Warships for Fishing Protection, Now Received</p>
<p>Following the commencement of the collection of fisheries construction fees by the Fisheries Construction Fee Collection Office of the Fisheries Improvement Committee for the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Region of the Ministry of Industry, the Fresh Fish Industry Association convened a general meeting of all fish merchants yesterday, attended by dozens of managers from various firms. Chairman Fang Jiaobo expressed his views, stating that the fisheries construction fee was implemented by the Ministry with painstaking effort to improve fisheries. The Ministry initially proposed a 5% levy on value, but following appeals from the Tax Exemption Committee, the Central Political Conference resolved to reduce it to 2%. After repeated requests from the Tax Exemption Committee and members of the Improvement Committee to Minister Chen, on the grounds that a 2% levy would place an unbearable burden on fishermen, it was approved to further reduce it to 1% of value. The collected fees will be used for fisheries improvements, based on the principle of "taking from fishing and using for fishing." The funds will be managed by Lin Kanghou, the head of the Management Group of the Improvement Committee. The first initiative is to protect the ocean, with other plans still in the works. Regarding ocean patrol vessels, in addition to the existing four, two new warships were purchased from the Navy and arrived in Shanghai yesterday. They will be dispatched immediately to patrol the ocean, ensuring more comprehensive protection during the fishing season. Attendees from various fish firms expressed satisfaction. The association will notify all industry colleagues to comply. The original text of the notification is as follows: Notification regarding the Fisheries Construction Fee Collection Office of the Fisheries Improvement Committee for the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Region of the Ministry of Industry: It has been resolved by the general meeting that all fish goods from Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces sold in Shanghai from April 15th onwards will be subject to a uniform deduction of 1% for construction fees. This is specially recorded for notification. Please comply accordingly. It is also reported that Liu Xingji, Director of the Fisheries and Animal Husbandry Department of the Ministry of Industry, arrived in Shanghai yesterday and, together with fish merchant representatives Gu Jiacai, Ge Liquan, Shen Lianqing, and Zhang Ze, received the two patrol vessels, Hai Ou and Hai Hong, from the Navy, which will be dispatched for ocean protection immediately.</p>
<h3>Beautiful Young Woman Commits Suicide in Hua An Apartments</h3>
<p>Mysterious Late-Night Phone Call Summons Doctor</p>
<p>Ultimately Succumbs to Overdose</p>
<p>| Tragic Diary... Pitiful Life |</p>
<p>Yesterday morning around 5:00 AM, a suicide by poisoning occurred in room 412 on the fourth floor of the Hua An Apartments on Jing'an Temple Road. The details obtained by this newspaper's reporter are recorded below:</p>
<p>(Beautiful Young Woman) The female protagonist of this case was a Cantonese woman, who identified herself as Chen Sufen, approximately 26 or 27 years old. She was extremely beautiful, fashionably dressed, and appeared quite affluent. She rented room 412 in the Hua An Apartments on the 13th of this month, paying a monthly rent of 200 yuan. In recent days, she frequently went out with male friends, returning late at night. On the evening before last, Chen hired a car alone, returning to her apartment at midnight and going to bed. Around 2:00 AM yesterday morning, a male friend visited and chatted with her until around 4:00 AM, when he left. Shortly thereafter,</p>
<p>(Mysterious Phone Call) Baolong Hospital on Bubbling Well Road received a phone call stating that a woman in room 412 of the Hua An Apartments had been poisoned and requesting that a doctor be sent immediately. The on-duty staff at the hospital asked where the call was coming from, and the reply was from Dongya number 508. As all the doctors had returned home, the hospital provided the address and telephone number of Dr. Luo Hou, requesting that they call him directly. Sure enough, moments later, Dr. Luo's home received the same call. Consequently, Dr. Luo immediately gathered the necessary medications and rushed to the Hua An Apartments.</p>
<p>(Life Hanging by a Thread) He went directly to the fourth floor and asked the attendants if a woman had been poisoned, but the attendants were completely unaware. Dr. Luo then stated that the phone call mentioned room 412. The attendants accompanied the doctor and knocked on the door several times without a response. Pushing the door, they found it unlocked and ajar. Inside, they found a woman wearing a silk nightgown, lying stiffly on the bed, her face pale. Two bottles of sleeping pills were on a small table in front of the bed, and the floor was covered in vomit. She was breathing rapidly, barely audible, and her lips showed signs of burns. Shortly thereafter, a bottle of Lysol was found near the bathtub in the inner room. Seeing this, Dr. Luo knew the young woman's life was hanging by a thread.</p>
<p>(Passing Away) He immediately administered a cardiac stimulant, but the poisoning was too severe, and it had no effect. Dr. Luo then notified Baolong Hospital to send a car to transport her to the hospital and reported the incident to the New Gate Police Station. Despite the doctors' best efforts, there was no hope, and she passed away at 10:50 AM yesterday morning. The hospital reported the death to the police station, which dispatched a coroner's vehicle to the morgue. Detective Lu Gendi led detectives to the Hua An Apartments and Dongya to investigate and determine the identity of the individuals within number 508, in order to uncover the truth.</p>
<p>(Letter to Parents) A bankbook from Sincere Company, containing $1,500 yuan, paper money $176 yuan, a diamond ring, photographs of herself and her male friends, and more than ten pieces of luxurious clothing were found in a small clothing box in her bedroom. A suicide note was also found, addressed to her parents, but it was only a single sheet of stationery that was not sealed, so it was impossible to ascertain her parents' address. There was also a diary, a small notebook, with entries from January 1st to March 26th, written in pencil in illegible handwriting. All of these items were taken back to the police station for safekeeping.</p>
<p>(Tragic Diary) The reporter glanced through the young woman's diary. It was filled with words of resentment. The entry for March 2nd read, "Mr. Luo came to talk for a long time, but we still couldn't figure out a good solution," and "Why would Mr. Luo introduce such a confused friend?" There were also many entries about a woman named Sister Rui, such as "Ah, Sister Rui, where are you now? Do you know that someone in this world is foolishly in love with you?" and "I once drew a fortune stick in Hangzhou, asking about the future outcome between me and Sister Rui." However, the most noteworthy entry was on March 26th, which read, "What matter, what I have enjoyed, if I continue to exist in this world, I feel there is no meaning." "The only reason I'm not committing suicide right now is because Xiang Ling has no one to raise, and secondly, I'm afraid that my father will die of anger when he hears this news." "I have also helped my family, but in the past, I have already ruined my family, and people will say that I am a demon." Overall, the diary was filled with sadness and abnormal emotional states.</p>
<p>(Young Woman's Background) Later, the detectives found the address of a friend of hers in Shanghai named Yu Zhibo, residing at 10 Wanyi Lane, Rue Louvain, in the French Concession. Detective Lu Gendi reported this to the detective chief, who notified the French police to assist in the investigation. It was confirmed that the young woman was indeed Cantonese and frequently traveled between Shanghai and Guangdong. She had many friends, and she and Yu's wife were close friends. It was also learned that she had been married several years ago and had a daughter (Xiang Ling). Later, due to disagreements (presumably initiated by the husband), they divorced, and she was raising the daughter. It is believed that she was deeply affected by this, which led to her decision to end her life. In short, it was nothing more than a love affair gone wrong. All of the young woman's affairs are currently being handled by Yu Zhibo. After the examination, the body will be transferred to the Universal Funeral Parlor on Jiaozhou Road for burial. As for Dongya number 508, the detectives found no one there who matched the person in the photos the young woman kept, so the police are still searching for clues.</p>

<h3>Silkworm Merchants from Zhejiang Province Gather in Shanghai Yesterday as Spring Silkworm Season Approaches</h3>
<p>To Discuss Ways to Alleviate Difficulties</p>
<p>Due to the brisk sales of Japanese silk and the heavy impact on Chinese silk, and with the approaching spring silkworm season, the Zhejiang Silk Industry Association, facing a lack of financial liquidity, convened a special committee meeting yesterday at 2:00 PM at the association's Shanghai office in Lianzhuli, Avenue Edward VII. Attendees included Gu Suming, Jiang Laixian (represented by Shen Zupei), Shen Tianxin, and Zhang Youyi. Chairman Chu Huiseng first reported on the progress of consultations with the Ministry of Industry and the Ministry of Finance regarding relief measures. The meeting then proceeded to discuss: (1) What relief measures should be adopted? It was resolved to request that the government allocate funds for implementation, referring to the measures proposed by the British Chamber of Commerce, and Chairman Chu and Standing Committee Member Shen would contact various parties separately. (2) Should the proposal by Director Tan of the Ministry to subsidize the export of raw silk by 50 taels and farmers who sell a full load by 3 yuan per load be approved? It was resolved that the proposal was problematic and difficult to implement, and fearing it would yield no results, it was disapproved. The meeting adjourned at 5:00 PM.</p>
<h3>National YWCA's Opinions on the Implementation of the Factory Act</h3>
<p>The Labor Committee of the National YWCA and the Labor Committee of the Shanghai YWCA held a joint meeting on April 5th of this year. Based on the results of previous Factory Act Research Society studies, a statement of opinions was formulated. Excerpts are as follows: (A) To achieve the development of Chinese industry and the improvement of labor conditions, the nationwide implementation of the Factory Act is essential. The Shanghai Municipal Council, using the integrity of the Concession's administrative power as a pretext, intends to amend Article 34 of the Yangjingbang Land Regulations, independently inspecting factories and not being subject to the control of the Chinese government, which hinders the implementation of the Chinese Factory Act. The members of our association believe that the entire territory of China must adhere to the Factory Act promulgated by the Chinese government. Under the management and guidance of the Chinese government, gradual implementation is sufficient to maintain the integrity of Chinese labor administration and promote the development of Chinese industry. The reasons are: (1) If the Shanghai Municipal Council only incorporates a few articles of the Factory Act into the factory licenses after amending the Yangjingbang Regulations, it will not thoroughly protect labor welfare. (2) If the implementation of the Factory Act differs in the three districts, it will not only hinder the widespread implementation of Chinese labor law, but also, in the event of disputes or lawsuits between workers and factories, the court's judgments will inevitably be inconsistent. (3) The proper regulations and implementation of the Factory Act can only be achieved by the national government; the Concession Municipal Council has no right to usurp this role. (4) If the Shanghai Municipal Council is allowed to adopt the Factory Act independently this time, cooperation between the Concession authorities and the Chinese government in the future will face even greater difficulties. (5) If factories in the Concession do not have to implement the Factory Act stipulated by the Chinese government, it will not only provide an excuse for unscrupulous merchants outside the Concession, but also the national industry will not be able to compete with factories within the Concession, and its future will suffer a significant blow, and so on.</p>

<h3>Letters to the Editor</h3>
<p>To the esteemed Editor:</p>
<p>In the Shanghai News of the 16th, there was an item reporting the telegram from sixty-two groups to Mr. Feng Yuxiang, urging him to lead troops in resistance against Japan. The ending was signed "National Lawyers Association, Jiangxi Association, respectfully," which was read with utter bewilderment. There are two points that must be clarified: (1) Although this association is jointly organized by more than sixty groups in Shanghai, all external documents and telegrams have always been issued in the name of the Shanghai Groups United for National Salvation, and there has never been a case of using a member group's name or a collective signature. (2) At the representative assembly of this association on the 15th of this month, several group representatives made a temporary proposal to telegraph Mr. Feng to lead troops in resistance against Japan and drafted a telegram. It was passed in principle, but the wording was announced to be left for revision. Unfortunately, the telegram was disclosed without revision, which is regrettable. Please publish this letter in your newspaper to make a correction and avoid misunderstandings. We look forward to your impartial cooperation. Addressed to the Editorial Department of the Shenbao, from the Shanghai Groups United for National Salvation, April 17.</p>
<p>To the Esteemed Editor of the Shenbao,</p>
<p>We are writing to you because we have recently received a letter from Messrs. Chen Tingzhen, Jiang Jiemin, and Tian Jiheng, members of the "Worship the Sixth Aircraft" Donation and Guarantee Committee, which reads: "Since the Japanese bandits invaded the Northeast, they have committed atrocities of rape and slaughter, occupying our land and insulting our compatriots. This is intolerable.</p>
<p>Our magazine's colleagues have always taken saving the country and the people as their mission. Considering the enemy at our door, we have long wanted to eliminate them. Hence, we have been raising funds for the 'Worship the Sixth' aircraft, hoping to send it to the front lines to help the army kill the enemy. However, the fundraising result was only 1,461 yuan and 80 cents. This is due to our colleagues' ineffectiveness in fundraising, but also due to the weakness of the people's sense of patriotism. With such a small amount, it is impossible to purchase an aircraft. Therefore, we think that you, sir, are commanding volunteer armies in the Northeast, and your righteous name is widely spread. We dare to transfer this money to the Northeast volunteer armies to purchase weapons and ammunition for the purpose of killing the enemy, hoping to achieve the effect. We know that a drop in the bucket cannot save the situation, but we can at least seek to make the funds not be wasted or misused, and we can also slightly deter the enemy. This money is all the subscription fees and reader donations collected by our publication from February 20 to April 8. After receiving it, please issue a receipt immediately and publish it in the newspapers for public knowledge to inspire the people," and they have attached a check for 1,461 yuan and 80 cents from the Shanghai Bank. Having looked into the matter, we find that the gentlemen who donated for the "Worship the Sixth" aircraft are highly admirable for their enthusiasm to save the country. However, because the funds raised were not enough, we will hand them over to you to donate for the Northeast volunteer armies to purchase weapons and ammunition, and we will follow the instructions in the letter to handle the purchase and distribution on your behalf. In addition to issuing a receipt, we are writing to your newspaper to publish and commend them in order to record their hard work and sincerity, which we are truly grateful for. Respectfully, Zhu Qinglan, April 17, 1933.</p>

<h3>Not Forgetting Danger in Times of Peace, Not Forgetting Peace in Times of Danger</h3>
<p>— Zhan Lu</p>
<p>(Cut) Hong Kong, which has been under British control for a century, relies on the power of Great Britain, and no one dares to even think of attacking it. However, from the 5th to the 6th of this month, the Hong Kong military and police authorities conducted a large-scale war game involving the army, navy, and air force. The mobilization of troops was as busy as a blazing fire, as flourishing as clouds rising, and as magnificent as the glow of dawn.</p>
<p>The pre-sent Mined Sweeper and Balikpapan battleships, carrying two brigades of Lincoln Corps troops and two hundred marines, acted as the enemy attacking Hong Kong, Kowloon, and the New Territories. There was no fixed time or specific location; they only had to take advantage of any opportunity to attack and use diversionary tactics to test the defensive strength and response methods of the defending side.</p>
<p>Although it was just a mock exercise, the scenario was performed with great realism. The enemy attacked Hong Kong in two ways: one was to land in Junk Bay to contain the defenders, and the other was to launch a stealth attack on Repulse Bay. As a result, the two armies engaged in a major battle in Wong Nai Chung. As the morning light dawned, the battle raged until 9:30 AM, when the defending army, using large-scale maneuvers, gained the upper hand. The commander then announced a ceasefire and ordered a return to camp for rest.</p>
<p>The Hong Kong military authorities declared: "If a real enemy were to launch a stealth attack, this exercise would result in the enemy's complete annihilation." The implication is clear: the British are always vigilant and have "not forgotten danger in times of peace." As for our so-called "Great Republic of China," which claims to be a family of five races, those five races have become other races, and the family is in the midst of a major split. The Japanese, who are carrying out aggression, have advanced from the Kwantung region to within the passes and from within the passes to North China. The Yangtze River basin is also under the threat of enemy attacks everywhere. However, those who engage in empty talk are enjoying themselves, traveling to the mountains, playing in the water, and building lavishly while acquiring numerous concubines. There is also a saying for this: "Not forgetting peace in times of danger."</p>
<h3>Reading</h3>
<p>— Zhao Ziming</p>
<p>"In books there are houses of gold, in books there are faces of jade." This was the purpose of reading for the ancients, and it was also their hope, because reading could lead to officialdom, and becoming an official meant plundering the wealth of the people, so golden houses could naturally house beauties.</p>
<p>But what is the use of reading now? Do you want to become an official through reading? That is simply as difficult as ascending to heaven, unless your father-in-law or brother-in-law becomes some kind of minister or committee member... Otherwise, even if you have a belly full of writing, you may still starve in front of the stove!</p>
<p>I remember last year's higher examinations, which cost countless hundreds of thousands, both public and private. How many of those who passed the examination actually got official positions?</p>
<p>To take a step back, let's say that after reading, you don't dream of becoming an official, but want to earn a living through labor. But society is as black as a crow. If you have knowledge but don't know how to flatter and brown-nose, it is also useless. It is common to see university graduates sitting on cement pavements, writing with chalk, begging for help from passersby. What are middle school and elementary school graduates supposed to do?</p>
<p>Although doctoral and bachelor's caps are placed on the heads of university students, they are equivalent to empty signboards. So what kind of books should you read? To eat, you must work hard at flattering and brown-nosing. "In books there are houses of gold, in books there are faces of jade" is fundamentally wrong. It should be changed to "In flattering there are houses of gold, in brown-nosing there are faces of jade" to keep up with the trend of the times!</p>
<h3>Old Goods Stall</h3>
<p>— Gong Yu</p>
<p>On Beijing Road, along both sides of the asphalt-paved stone road, if you have free time, you can take a look. Here, the old goods dealers jostle shoulder to shoulder, and there are quite a few treasures. Moreover, they also welcome customers to visit, without necessarily having to buy their goods.</p>
<p>If you walk into their shop and are dressed neatly, they will talk to you very courteously. If an economist walks in, they will also display the unique habits of Chinese merchants, with a "No Trespassing" sign on their faces; watching you as you appreciate the items one by one.</p>
<p>Although their shops are narrow and simple, their principle is not to embrace "gold and jade on the outside, rotten straw on the inside." I dare to guarantee that when you go in, you will be dazzled. Here are the court boots and hats used by officials during the Qing Dynasty, and antiques labeled as bronze and porcelain from the Song and Yuan dynasties. There are also imported radio receivers, typewriters, gramophones, and other scientific weapons. There are also huge household items and small hardware parts. But the most displayed are semi-new and old leather shoes and felt hats. They use extremely economical funds to collect such a wide range of items, which is simply like a museum of ancient and modern history, truly an extraordinary thing.</p>
<p>But after you run in and look at it from beginning to end, you can't help but fancy a few items and buy them reluctantly. Its cost is often half the price of the same new one; if they receive this item at the right price, it may even be as cheap as one-third.</p>
<h3>From Private Detectives to Detective Novels</h3>
<p>— Sheng</p>
<p>Recently, society is becoming more prosperous on the surface, but it is strong outside and weak inside. It is not to be relied upon. All industries are bankrupt. The countryside is collapsing. The economic panic in the country has reached its extreme, so crimes such as adultery, robbery, and murder are emerging one after another. Try to read the newspaper, what day is without them? Therefore, cracking cases, redressing grievances, and extracting the essence, detectives are especially needed. However, talents are hard to come by, not worth mentioning, which makes people sigh at the difficulty of finding talents.</p>
<p>In Europe and the United States, in addition to public detectives, there are also private detectives, and the achievements of private detectives are often better than those in officialdom, so there are inherent reasons for this. Most of the detectives in our country come from the official sector. Although they have experience, their knowledge is short, so they cannot break the crimes as they wish. Moreover, there are criminals who use scientific methods to kill people, so detectives must know science before they can find traces. However, it is rare to find someone who has ordinary common sense and can also understand science, and private detectives are even more lacking. They have not become popular and are not enough to help the officialdom. My friend Mr. Jin likes to study detective science. He has established a great aspiration to become a private detective in the future, revealing evil and overturning injustice, so that people can be happy. I don't know if he will be able to achieve his goal in the future.</p>
<p>Mr. Jin likes to read detective novels. The Sherlock Holmes cases in the West are extremely subtle, but they are not suitable for the psychology of Chinese people. There are very few Chinese detective novel writers. He said that the one that is reasonable and can inspire people's wisdom is the Hawthorne detective case written by Mr. Cheng Xiaoqing, which is worth reading, and the implication can especially criticize the psychology of social criminals. According to Cheng's Hawthorne detective case sequel is now being published, and is very popular with readers, and is praised as the Oriental Sherlock Holmes. I hope that Mr. Jin and Mr. Cheng, one will strive to improve their writing day by day, and the other will strive to improve their knowledge day by day, to be the light of the detective industry in our country.

<h3>The Art of Socializing</h3>
<p>— Xu Benxi</p>
<p>Socializing, also known as small talk, is the beginning of getting to the point in formal events or other situations. In order to engage in social activities in society, one inevitably needs to know how to socialize. Because small talk often involves empty and untrue words, socializing has become an art. In my personal observation, art is at least being able to utilize Heaven, Earth, People, and Time.</p>
<p>Heaven and Earth do not refer to astronomy and geography, but rather to the idea of</p>
<p>bringing up the present weather as a topic of conversation. For example, when people say to you, "The weather has been great these past few days, the sun is so warm!" Of course, you know the weather is good, but you still have to respond. You should say: "Yes, spring is really comfortable and pleasant." Otherwise, you should say, "Indeed, it hasn't rained, and the wind is quite intoxicating." From there, you can extrapolate and tell what you know about the theories and experiences of heaven and earth, and people will not say that you are "eloquent, knowledgeable, and talented"!</p>
<p>As for People and Time, they are somewhat different from Heaven and Earth. If you have a request from the other party, or the other party has something to ask of you, then even if you consider the people praised by the other party to be treacherous officials and worthless scoundrels, you must say: "Yes, how many people like that are successful in the world?" Or say: "Such people will surely save China!" In this way, there is at least an artistic foundation for the main text that you want to talk about, which will facilitate its success. Furthermore, when talking about the times, you should make great pronouncements. You know that the country's affairs are so bad that empty words cannot help the reality, but you should still try your best to talk about them. If you can, you should slam the table and shout, even to the point of tears. If you can use the four words Heaven, Earth, People, and Time, then you will have food to eat.</p>
<p>Or you may say: "Isn't such a fraudulent and farcical art of dealing with the world so boring?" Then you should know that today's society and world are even more fraudulent and farcical than that!</p>

<p>He took two dollars and a few hairy bills, placed them on the stone step, glared at the oil vendor, and said:</p>
<p>Take it. After speaking, he took his mother's hand and walked into the house. When Jiang saw the oil vendor leave, she said in a low voice: We owe people money, we should speak nicely. Why do you get angry as soon as it's mentioned? Gui Zhi said: Look at his appearance, how can we not be angry? "Is Jiang Old Lady home?" This terrible question was again spoken outside the window. Gui Zhi said: Who? The outside replied, "From the coal shop." Gui Zhi felt that it was not easy for her mother to deal with creditors, so she went out to greet him. She saw the owner of the coal shop wearing an old sheepskin jacket, a leather hat,</p>
<p>with several thick account books under his arm, and said: Boss, how much do I owe you? The boss smiled: Miss, I sent the account slip yesterday, not much, five dollars. Your old lady promised to come and collect the money today. Gui Zhi said: I'll discuss it with you, pay you half first..." The boss held the account book, repeatedly smiling and bowing: Miss, no, no! I'm also in trouble this year. Gui Zhi said: "In trouble, it won't be solved by us two or three dollars." The boss smiled: "You are a smart person, think about it, if every household owes half and gives half, will I get it? They are all old customers for many years,</p>
<p>How can I say who should clear and who should owe? Miss, help me. The oil vendor is very rich, you paid him in full, you are too embarrassed to reject me like this." As he spoke, he bowed repeatedly. Gui Zhi was confident that she could resist creditors, but now, she had no way. She said: "I don't care, you go talk to my mother." After speaking,</p>
<p>he turned around and left. Jiang had no choice but to come out. The owner of this coal shop really knew how to collect money. He kept begging people, making Jiang have no way, so she had to pay the money in full. Since these two debts were paid in full, the debt collectors happened to know the news. (45)</p>

<h3>National Crisis: A Plea for Self-Reflection</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhuan</p>
<p>Someone asked me, "Loyalty to the nation and to one's duties are essential for national prosperity. As for filial piety, it is not needed in this utilitarian era." I replied, "The Chinese concepts of loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, and righteousness are inherently abstract. Great sages and wise men truly understand them, while ordinary men and women find them easy to practice but difficult to comprehend. Most of us, mediocre individuals, adopt an attitude of 'neither being able to command nor accepting orders.' However, there are two paths to gain faith: (A) For scholars, broadly read other books. Initially, they may not believe in these concepts. However, upon reading Chinese history and observing how success or failure, prosperity or decline, are invariably linked to self-inflicted fortune or misfortune, they will believe. (For Confucius, the Analects are set against the backdrop of thousands of sage-kings in history. If one has read the Comprehensive Mirror for Aid in Government, their faith in the Analects will be strengthened.) (B) For those involved in practical affairs, initially, they may not believe in these concepts when everything is smooth. However, upon encountering hardship and, in a moment of extreme boredom and reflection, tentatively attributing the root cause to the teachings of Confucius and Mencius, and then finding it effective upon trying it, they will also believe. Furthermore, the approaches of the Southern and Northern Song dynasties are insufficient to save a nation in crisis. The approach of Sun Yat-sen's faction involves empty talk that is divorced from national affairs." Now, I will answer your question in several points: (1) If Zhang Xueliang had understood the concept of "filial piety," the loss of Manchuria and Jehol would not have occurred. Bo Gong Sheng avenged his father's death, as did Wu Zixu and King Fuchai of Wu. Yue Wu Mu followed his mother's teachings and killed enemies. Gu Tinglin followed his mother's teachings and sought revenge against Qian Qianyi. These individuals are all remembered in history. However, citing historical events may invite mockery from the illiterate, and the comparison may be inappropriate. The Water Margin, written in a fashionable vernacular, can be cited. In The Water Margin, when a tiger kills Li Kui's mother, Li Kui immediately raids the tiger's lair and kills the tiger cubs. This is known to everyone. Did Zhang Xueliang not know who killed his father? Did he not know that the iron hammer of Bolangsha was wielded by his father's attacker, and that his father was killed by the bomb in Xinmintun? Instead of emulating Li Kui, who was loyal and righteous like Fu Zhongyi in the Water Margin, he chose to emulate Wang Yan, who indulged in pleasure in Ganzhou. Using this to resist the enemy and seek merit, it is no wonder that Liaoning lamented, Jilin and Heilongjiang mourned, and Jehol was sacrificed. This is clear evidence that one who is not filial cannot be loyal to the nation. (2) Ten years ago, a certain military governor of Jiangsu was in mourning for his father. The people of Jiangsu were overjoyed and prepared to hold a farewell party, sending a telegram to the president stating that the military governor would naturally be "consumed by thoughts of filial piety and return to his hometown to conduct the funeral." The military governor himself telegraphed the government, stating that he was willing to "seize the moment to serve the nation and remain in office while mourning." Subsequently, the provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang engaged in over forty days of civil war, resulting in mountains of corpses, seas of blood, and widespread misery. Commentators called it the "opium and private tax war." This is also evidence that one who is not filial cannot be loyal to the nation. (3) At the Kuiqiu Alliance convened by Duke Huan of Qi, the first sentence of the covenant stated, "Punish the unfilial." Duke Huan of Qi was a "hegemon who warded off barbarians." Because he knew that the nation valued filial piety, he was able to ward off foreign invaders. Therefore, Confucius questioned Guan Zhong, saying, "Is he benevolent? Is he benevolent? Without Guan Zhong, we would be wearing our hair loose and fastening our clothes on the left." Guan Zhong also wrote, "Propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame are the four pillars of the nation. If the four pillars are not upheld, the nation will perish." (4) China is a nation of family system (this is what the Prime Minister praised most in his complete book). China is also a nation that does not establish religion. China is also a nation where literacy is not widespread. Only the concept of "filial piety" can, firstly, maintain the family system to perpetuate humanity; secondly, guide people toward goodness without religious formalities; and thirdly, provide the most widespread education that enriches the strong without increasing them and strengthens the weak without diminishing them. Possessing these three virtues, it is therefore solid in defense and victorious in battle. (5) Furthermore, I have an additional announcement. Recently, the British scholar J.H. SLEEMAN wrote a book entitled "WHITE CHINA." The book describes Chinese culture in detail and praises the loyalty and bravery of the 19th Route Army in the Battle of Shanghai, comparing their strategy to that of the famous British Admiral Nelson. The book says that Japan's barbaric behavior is like the actions of the Vandalic barbarians. Alas, like Sleeman, only those who know that China values "loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, love, trustworthiness, righteousness, and peace" write books to help China resist Japan. The love of the British scholar for China can be described as the intention of a benevolent gentleman. Miao Zhuan said, "I can still see those who serve the nation with their writings." When the Sino-Japanese War of 1894 broke out, the "Collection of Universal Loyal Outrage" in twelve thick volumes was published in less than three months. Alas, it is now gone!</p>

<h3>Regarding the Question "Can One Return to the Countryside?"</h3>
<p>A Collection of Letters for Discussion</p>
<p>(11) Letter from Mr. Wang Longzhang of this city! To Return to the Countryside, One Must First Have a Plan</p>
<p>"Go to the countryside," "Go to the countryside," these are the most fashionable slogans in recent years, and also the most hotly debated issues in the country. Recently, I read the discussions in the Reader's Advisor column about "Can One Return to the Countryside?" Participants in the debate have included Mr. Xiong Sheng, Mr. You Huai Fu, and Mr. Liu Simin, among others. They each have their own positions and views. Although I am unlearned, I would like to take this opportunity to express some of my humble opinions, which have been lingering in my mind for years. In present-day China, more than 80% of the population are farmers. The entire countryside is becoming bankrupt due to the economic aggression of imperialists. The unemployment problem has become the only disease. Therefore, the answer to the question of returning to the countryside is, of course, yes, absolutely yes. There is no need for deep discussion. However, what we need to study now is not the question of whether one can return or not, but the question of "how to return to the countryside." To farm? What should one do if one has no land to farm? To teach? What should one do if one cannot even find a teaching position in a rural elementary school? As for rural construction? What should one do if there is a lack of substantial capital and scientific talent, among other prerequisites? All of these questions are worthy of study and discussion. If one only shouts the slogan of returning to the countryside without a proper plan in advance, it will not help the general unemployed population in their hope. As this newspaper replied to Mr. Xiong Sheng, "It is indeed not easy to find work in the city, and it is also difficult to make a living in the countryside. Under such circumstances, if one wants to return to the countryside solely for the sake of making a living, then we really do not see any optimistic prospects. Not only are there no optimistic prospects, but one will only end up as an unemployed farmer, still going hungry." Mr. You insists that "idealistic people in the cities should go to the countryside to lead farmers to transform and build, alleviate suffering, and do some work that benefits the country and the people." But is there really any method to run to the countryside to seek the welfare of society at large, and to seek a living for individuals, at a time when "the cry of rural economic bankruptcy can not only be heard everywhere, but can also be seen in the actual daily situation, as there are many, many people who, as a result of natural disasters and man-made misfortunes, cannot stand on their feet and run to the city, and they are certainly not a small number... The entire countryside itself cannot be maintained, let alone accommodate outsiders"? In short, it is not difficult to return to the countryside, but the key is to have a "plan." As for Mr. You's clever plans for Mr. Xiong Sheng to run elementary schools and sell prepared medicines, it goes without saying that whether they will work or not is problematic. Even if everything goes smoothly and proceeds as planned, it will only be a partial and individual solution, like a drop in the ocean, a small and insignificant solution. It is difficult to cure the root of the disease in the vast Chinese countryside, and it is difficult to thoroughly solve the problem for the vast number of unemployed compatriots. In short, I feel that Mr. Xiong Sheng's wandering astray and his agonizing cries are a consistent phenomenon among the young people of China today. This is a huge political and social problem, and there are countless others who are in the same situation as you. There is no need to be pessimistic, no need to be negative. I believe that you can write such thoughtful and expressive text, and at least you can earn a small income from selling articles and submitting them to newspapers, enough for some big cakes and fried dough sticks. Before there is a detailed plan, do not blindly run to the countryside on the strength of slogans, and add the title of "unemployed farmer." (Note: I am not opposed to Mr. Xiong Sheng going to the countryside, but I advocate going to the countryside after having a plan in advance.)</p>
<p>As for Mr. You's views, although I would not say as harshly as Mr. Liu that "Mr. You's thinking is a true reflection of the current Chinese bourgeoisie's view of the current political situation," Mr. You only advocates the abstract principle of going to the countryside, but has no effective and easy-to-implement concrete plans. This point is particularly unsatisfactory. Even if there are such plans, they are only for Mr. Xiong Sheng's personal little plan. As for whether the proposal in the article "A Respectful Announcement to All College and University Students in the Country" published in the Education Section of this newspaper to take turns serving in the countryside for one year is now feasible, it is questionable. I respectfully ask Mr. You, who "studies agriculture, practices agriculture, has not left the countryside for fourteen years, has personally seen the farmhouses of England, America, France, Germany, and Russia, has interacted with several foreign farm children as classmates, has spent several months in rural practice abroad, and has also been to many rural areas for more than ten years after returning to China, and has read many books and newspapers about the Chinese countryside," to tell us some concrete and common detailed plans on "how to return to the countryside." Then: The fragmented and vast countryside, and the tens of millions of unemployed comrades, will truly benefit infinitely. Finally, there is no shortage of brilliant people in the country, and I hope that there will be many instructions on "how to return to the countryside." Furthermore, I would like to say a word to the editor, please open up this small garden for a few days, so that this question can obtain a more satisfactory harvest, because it is an important and urgent question at present!</p>

<h3>Sun Yat-sen University Orders Students to Attend Classes</h3>
<p>The Guangdong Provincial National Sun Yat-sen University suddenly experienced a strike on the afternoon of the 11th of this month, as reported by this newspaper. It is now learned that President Shao is making efforts to quell the storm. The police officer who beat someone was sent to the Public Security Bureau for questioning, and an apology was made to the director of the farm. At the same time, several notices were issued, requiring all students to attend classes on the 13th without exception. Those who do not attend classes will be marked as absent, and those who obstruct classes will be dealt with severely. The important notices from the school are appended below:</p>
<p>▲School Notice Regarding Students Attending Classes as Usual to Avoid Delaying Studies: This time, because the police chief and clerk of the Forestry Farm beat the staff of the Forestry Farm, a very small number of people incited a meeting to resolve to strike and fight for justice. Yesterday, it was earnestly and thoroughly explained that the beaters had been removed from their posts and sent to the government for severe punishment, and Director Hou's statement the day before was considered a satisfactory resolution. This is entirely a matter within the scope of administration, and the matter has been concluded. Students should not be misled by others and hold meetings and strikes that delay their studies. Now, we will even more deeply and earnestly appeal to all students. Since September 18th, the Japanese enemy has occupied our Guandong, disturbed our Tianjin and Shanghai, seized our dangerous passes, and plundered our Jehol. The youth of the four northeastern provinces are trapped under the enemy's slaughter and are not only unable to study, but their lives are also difficult to protect. Even the Yellow River and Yangtze River basins are precarious and difficult to study in peace. Considering that the whole country is in a period of national crisis, those who still feel that they can study should be in the southwest. Therefore, the president of this school often tells the students, "We who are here have books to read, we should think of the northeastern youth who have no books to read, and we should study twice as hard to save the country, so that the northeastern youth can also have books to read like us, and then we will have done our best." Unexpectedly, a school that has been stable for more than a year is now discussing a strike over a matter that has been resolved by the Forestry Farm staff. How can you be at peace with your conscience? As for the occurrence of this incident, the president of this school is more indignant than all the students. Therefore, upon arriving at school on the afternoon of the 9th and hearing about it, he immediately removed Police Chief Lin from his post and detained him. The next morning, in addition to apologizing to Technical Assistant Lai at the hospital, he also apologized to Director Hou. After asking Technical Assistant Lai about the situation on the day, he also detained Special Clerk Hua Wen and immediately sent him to the Public Security Bureau to ask him to be dealt with according to the law. The perpetrators have been handed over to the government, and the school has fulfilled its responsibility. As for whether they should be shot, this is a legal issue, not a school issue. Therefore, Director Hou immediately issued a statement on the 10th explaining the school's handling of the matter and considered it a satisfactory resolution. The matter has been resolved, but the students only then went on strike to make demands. Thinking about it calmly, isn't it ridiculous? I sincerely hope that the students will consider and investigate each matter in the future so as not to be misled by others and fall into blind action. Even with this incident, Director Hou has stated that he was not insulted, but the instigators still said that Director Hou was beaten. Not only was Technical Assistant Lai not injured in the bones, but his skin was not even broken, but the instigators still said that his ribs were broken. The perpetrators have already been sent to the Public Security Bureau, but the instigators still said to send them to the Public Security Bureau under the supervision of the General Assembly to be executed by shooting. The president of this school has already apologized to Director Hou and Technical Assistants Lai and Huang, but the instigators still said to ask the president to apologize to Director Hou and Mr. Lai and Mr. Huang. The students actually took their ears as their eyes, and even resolved to demand things that the school has already done. If things that are close at hand and easy to see in the school are easily misled by others, then when major national and social events are on your shoulders in the future, won't you be frightened? There is one more thing that I must tell the students. Half a month ago, the Political Affairs Committee received a confidential report from Nanjing that someone had sent people to this school to mobilize students to cause a disturbance. They immediately transferred the matter to the deans of each college for confidential prevention. Unexpectedly, today, a school that has been stable for more than a year has actually seen this happen, and we are sighing deeply. A very small number of people with political backgrounds have other plans and are being driven by others, not hesitating to be tools for others, abandon their studies, and disrupt the school. This is painful, but it is difficult to feel for the majority of people without political backgrounds who are misled and manipulated by others. Therefore, we must expose this kind of conspiracy to the students. Taking the facts of this incident as an example, before the 10th, the perpetrators had been removed from their posts and sent to the Public Security Bureau to be dealt with according to the law, and the president had also apologized to the parties concerned. When dozens of students from the College of Agriculture came, they had already been told in person. In the afternoon, Dean Shao, Director Hou, and the professors gave detailed explanations. The matter had been satisfactorily resolved, but Dai Jiaqi, Jiang Yidong, Zhang Jinxuan, Wang Zuoren, etc. still did not hesitate to take the facts that had already been done as an excuse to confuse their classmates and hold a meeting on the 11th to demand the school, using it as an excuse for a strike. If they had no ulterior motives, why would they do this? This is what we hope the students will see through. And the most important thing is that we hope that the students will remember the urgency of the national crisis and the difficulty of seeking knowledge, do not waste time, attend classes as usual, so that they can learn and save the country. We have great expectations for you. This is the notice.</p>

<h3>Maiden Voyage of the National Shanghai College of Commerce Volleyball Team</h3>
<p>▲ Went to Hangzhou for Observation, Lost to Zhijiang but Won Against the College of Engineering</p>
<p>The National Shanghai College of Commerce has recently paid close attention to sports, focusing on universal development rather than external competitions (due to the small playground of the temporary school building rented after the destruction of all school property in the January 28th Incident). Every student is required to take physical education. The results have been significant after a year. Now almost everyone has a habit of being active, and the school no longer sees any bookworms. The past sluggishness has been completely eliminated. In order to increase interest, a volleyball team was temporarily organized from those who had achieved better results in daily training. They went to Hangzhou last week for observation, in order to connect with each other. They first exchanged skills with the Zhijiang College of Arts and Sciences, which has a long history. As a result, Zhijiang won 3 to 1, with scores of 9 to 21, 21 to 12, 21 to 8, and 21 to 10. This was the first time in the history of the College of Commerce that they had participated in a competition. They lacked confidence and experience, and most of the team members could not fully exert their abilities during the match. However, they gained a lot from this encounter. The next day, they had a friendly match with the Zhejiang University College of Engineering. The performance of the College of Commerce improved significantly compared to the previous day, and they finally won with scores of 18 to 21, 21 to 18, 21 to 12, and 21 to 17. The feelings between the two sides were harmonious, and they parted happily. The members of the College of Commerce team were Pan Shiwei (secretary), Lu Qintang (captain), Liu Xiaoguang, Li Zhenming, Yu Renxian,</p>
<p>Zou Deheng, Chen Qibin, Zhu Xihe, Yin Ruizhi, Wang Xiangyong, Yu Chunxun, Wu Zhendong, and Hu Kun, etc.</p>
<h3>Great China University Wins Jiangnan University Basketball Championship</h3>
<p>▲ Won Again in the Second Final Against Jinan with a Score of 41 to 26</p>
<p>▲ The Situation Was Tense, Jinan Lost Ground in the Last Ten Minutes Due to Heavy Pressure</p>
<p>Great China University won this year's Jiangnan University Basketball Championship. In yesterday's second final against Jinan, Great China won again by a large margin of 41 to 26. This is the first time that Great China University has won the Jiangnan University Basketball Championship. Last year's competition was not held due to the Shanghai War. The previous champion was Chizhi. Great China hosted a banquet last night to reward the championship team. The situation of yesterday's second final is as follows:</p>
<h3>Great China's Arrogant Momentum</h3>
<p>Several seconds after the referee Li Zuqi blew the whistle, Great China jumped and got the ball. Chen Shiqiu charged to the basket and scored with a swoop. Jinan's Xu Rongshui scored a point with a free throw. Great China's Guan Dang'an attacked from behind, and Ren Jiexing made a wonderful shot. After these two goals, Great China was leading by 6 to 1, with arrogant momentum. The cheering students raised their voices.</p>
<h3>Jinan Tries Hard to Catch Up</h3>
<p>Seeing the fierce momentum, Jinan called a timeout to temporarily blunt their attack. Yu Wencai, Xu Rongshui, and Wang Nanzhen successively made contributions, changing the score from 6 to 3, 8 to 5, and then to an equal 8 to 8. The situation changed. Han Zhenyuan's goal even put Jinan ahead by two points. This was the golden age of Jinan. Ren Jiexing's two hits put Great China ahead again by 14 to 10, leading by four points. Yin Guiren refused to give in, scoring one point with a free throw and one point with a long shot. The result of the first half was 14 to 13, with Great China winning over Jinan by one point.</p>
<h3>The Situation Remains Tense</h3>
<p>The first half passed in an extremely tense situation. The battle resumed in the second half, and there was still no relaxation. Ren Jiexing and Chen Shiqiu scored continuously, and Yin Guiren and Xu Rongshui also retaliated, still seeing the equal score of 17 to 17. Great China's Guan Dang'an was fouled out for the fourth time, making the score 21 to 18. Jinan began to lag behind by three points. Great China did not waver due to Guan's expulsion, and the attack became even more fierce, and the situation took a sharp turn.</p>
<h3>The Battle Situation Takes a Sharp Turn</h3>
<p>After 21 to 18, Great China began to make vigorous progress. Jinan fought hard to defend, but the formation eventually crumbled. Ren Jiexing hit three out of three shots, making the score 25 to 18, then 32 to 20, 36 to 26. The score difference hovered around ten points. Great China added another five points, and the game ended with a final score of 41 to 26.</p>
<h3>Great China Was Slightly Better</h3>
<p>Yesterday's performance was better than the first final, the panic was slightly reduced, and the situation was tense all the way until the end when the outcome was decided. In terms of skill, Great China was better than Jinan, being more familiar and accurate. Ren Jiexing's shooting was the best. Jinan was slightly unskilled and slow.</p>
<p>Unable to find opportunities under the basket, Yin Guiren's long shots created a lot for Jinan.</p>
<p>▲ Great China Fouls Score ▲ Jinan Fouls Score</p>

<h3>Interbank Loan Rate Heard Again at Two Percent</h3>
<p>丨Market Atmosphere Still Undeveloped丨</p>
<p>Yesterday, due to the foreign banks not yet opening, the interbank loan market atmosphere remained undeveloped. The market dispersed after a brief gathering. The interbank loan rate remained unchanged, the same as two percent in both the morning and afternoon, which was slightly better than the previous day. The situation was still loose and harmonious, with no signs of activity. The transaction volume of discounted bills was over 5.1 million in the morning market and over 400,000 in the afternoon market. The transaction volume in the small general association was over 600,000. Money shops collected about 5 to 6 million yuan from Chinese banks for various payments, collected over 36 million yuan from fellow foreign public bills, collected 600,000 to 700,000 yuan from various remittance routes, had 150,000 yuan of inbound funds and 300,000 yuan of outbound funds, and had a net withdrawal of over 1 million yuan in banknotes. The market price of silver coins remained the same as the previous day in the morning and afternoon markets of Jiangnan small silver coins, at 866 yuan, with a transaction volume of 6,000 jiao in the morning market and 2,000 jiao in the afternoon market. The price of Guangdong small silver coins was 797 yuan in the morning market and 800 yuan in the afternoon market, resulting in a total increase of 6 yuan compared to the previous day's morning market, with a transaction volume of 90,000 jiao in the morning market and 45,000 jiao in the afternoon market. Copper coins increased by 1,000 wen, to 307,000 wen, with a transaction volume of over 38,000 strings of wen.</p>
<h3>Total Number of Cleared Instruments</h3>
<p>The total number of instruments cleared by the Shanghai Clearing House on the 17th was 1,980,928.99 silver dollars, including 1,980,928.98 silver dollars cleared via interbank transfer, as the Bund banks were closed for the holiday.</p>
<h3>Securities</h3>
<p>Government Bonds Extremely Weak</p>
<p>Various Prices Fall Again by 3-4 Jiao to 1 Yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday, although the price fluctuations on the Chinese Securities Exchange were not significant, the trend was quite simple. Because Qinhuangdao was again declared lost, the market sentiment was extremely weak. Fortunately, the Guangdong group not only did not sell, but also slightly replenished their holdings.</p>
<p>At the opening in the morning, the market sentiment was quite tense, with most advocating selling.</p>
<p>For a time, the quantity of supply and demand was quite disparate, and the market price fell by several jiao from the 18 mark. Afterwards, there was a trend of supply exceeding demand in all items. No. 50 sold particularly heavily, so the downward trend intensified after the entry of sellers. The customs tax fell by about 1 yuan. However, because the large investors remained cautious and took no action, the closing and afternoon trading both entered a state of anxiety, indicating that the short sellers did not dare to be bold.</p>
<p>Because the situation is changing extremely rapidly, especially as the settlement period approaches, there are many dangers. From the slight rebound of two or three jiao at the morning closing and the mixed ups and downs in the two afternoon sessions, it can be seen that people are uneasy and have no definite grasp. As a result, market prices fell by three or four jiao to one yuan. If the war does not extend to Tianjin and Hebei, market prices may rebound, and caution is necessary. The total transaction volume was 8,311,000 yuan, of which only 1,000 yuan was in spot goods, with futures and forward contracts accounting for two-thirds and recent contracts accounting for one-third. Among the various transactions, the consolidated customs tax accounted for the majority, totaling 3,265,000 yuan, military cuts accounted for 1,190,000 yuan, and the 19 mark accounted for 1,025,000 yuan, with the rest ranging from tens of thousands to 700,000 to 800,000.</p>
<p>Yarn and Cotton</p>
<h3>Marked Yarn and Cotton Still Showing Weakness</h3>
<p>The yarn market fell in the morning and rose in the afternoon, with the situation appearing slightly calmer. After falling for many days,</p>
<p>it has fallen by ten yuan and five jiao compared to the high price, prompting those who had made profits to cover their short positions. The market situation rose slightly in the afternoon. As a result of the meeting of the factories in Wuxi,</p>
<p>it is likely that they will agree to reduce production, with two night shifts per week. As for the future,</p>
<p>it is still necessary to consider actual sales.</p>
<h3>Manchu Standard Also Sees Decline</h3>
<p>The Manchu Standard opened in the morning with a clearing of long positions.</p>
<p>The market atmosphere was chaotic, and the sentiment was not good. Prices for all months fell by 1.78 yuan to 2 yuan. In the afternoon, it was heard that the Sichuan group had some transactions, and prices for all months rebounded by 0.9 to 1.34 yuan. The total transaction volume for the day was 60,100 bales. It was found that the sales volume included 1,300 bales from Yuanda, 1,400 bales from Mingde, 1,650 bales from Gengfeng, 3,750 bales from Changfeng, 1,750 bales from Yongchang, and 1,100 bales from Huachang.</p>
<p>1,200 bales from Jinchun, 1,000 bales from Dafeng, 1,350 bales from Senkang, 3,050 bales from Renfeng, 3,400 bales from Xincheng,</p>
<p>1,000 bales from Yiyu. The closing prices are as follows:</p>
<p>Manchu Standard Closing Prices, Gains/Losses, Open Interest July 19.00 Down 0.446 336,400</p>
<p>April 18.40 Down 0.524 336,500</p>
<p>August 19.21 - 336,400 May 18.56 - 643,150</p>
<p>September 19.35 - 719,000 June 18.77 - 649,800</p>
<p>Total 219,250</p>
<h3>Spot Yarn Sales More Active</h3>
<p>Spot yarn sales were more active. It was found that the total purchase volume of various groups for the day was 956 bales. Prices fell by 1.25 yuan in the morning and rose by 0.2 to 0.5 yuan in the afternoon. The purchase amounts of various groups are as follows:</p>
<p>Shantou 44 Sichuan 225 Xiamen 20 Fellow Traders 475</p>
<p>North Group 15 Guangdong 90 Changsha 20 Inland 13</p>
<p>Zhenjiang 20</p>
<p>The flower market shows signs of instability because the yarn market is sluggish, and the factories refuse to handle high-priced raw cotton. As a result, the inventory of spot cotton in various producing areas is increasing daily, and the number of people coming to Shanghai to hedge is increasing. Market prices are difficult to support.</p>
<p>However, the major bulls in the local market are still holding on tightly and have not yet liquidated. It was said that a portion of US cotton buyers were active in the afternoon due to fears of a large increase in the price of US cotton due to inflation, and the market rebounded by 0.5 to 0.6 yuan.</p>
<h3>This Month's Cotton Down 4 Jiao</h3>
<p>The Zheng Standard opened weakly in the morning, with a panicked sentiment. Due to the sluggishness of the yarn market, many liquidated their positions. The near and two months broke through the 2 yuan mark, with prices for all months falling by 0.3, 0.6, and 0.5 yuan.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, those who had made profits covered their short positions, rebounding by 0.25 to 0.45 yuan. The total transaction volume for the day was 114,700 dan. It was found that the sales volume included 1,300 dan from Xinheng, 2,700 dan from Yuanyu Chang, 3,500 dan from Changhe, 6,200 dan from Changfeng, 2,300 dan from Dachang, 1,600 dan from Suilong, 1,800 dan from Yuanda, and 1,500 dan from Yuda. The purchase volume included 3,100 dan from Jifeng, 10,100 dan from Hengyi, 1,800 dan from Da Ji, 1,700 dan from Yi Chang, 2,400 dan from Yu Chang, and 2,300 dan from Yu Kang. The closing prices are as follows:</p>
<p>Zheng Standard Closing Prices, Gains/Losses, Open Interest</p>
<p>July 42.90 Down 0.3 107,100</p>
<p>April 41.80 Down 0.4 56,000</p>
<p>August 43.40 - 594,200</p>
<p>May 42.15 - 10,800</p>
<p>Total 441,300</p>
<p>June 42.70 - 5,100,200</p>
<h3>Factory Demand Feels Extremely Depleted</h3>
<p>The spot cotton business remains quiet. Because the price difference between yarn and cotton is too large, how can the factories purchase it? As a result, the atmosphere is extremely bleak. The source includes 600 bales of Yao cotton,</p>
<p>Shugou Cotton 41.25 Tongyi Factory Imports 200 bales Spot Goods Delivered to Factory</p>
<h3>Liverpool Weekly Report</h3>
<p>Last week, spot sales were peaceful. On the futures side, due to the holiday and the US rural relief bill, it was very unstable. Before the holiday, there was a lot of profit-taking, but buyers were active, and the firm trend was maintained. Although Egyptian cotton lacked buyers and business was slow, the market situation was very firm.</p>
<h3>Grain and Rice Market Settling, but with a Soft Tone</h3>
<p>(Hunan) Yesterday, there were more than ten sources, and the sales volume was slightly higher. The market situation was stable,</p>
<p>but the situation seemed to have a soft tone. Tianjin-bound shipments were suspended due to the impact of the situation, and only Yantai-bound shipments were being made. Tongli-bound japonica rice was 345 bags, while Nanyang-bound Shantou Hakka shipments were just over 1,000 bags of Bo rice. However, the situation was sluggish, and there was no good atmosphere, resulting in no change in the prices of Sutong-bound rice and Qingjiao Nangang rice.</p>
<p>Du Jian Yang Jian has not yet been sold. The Du Jian situation is settled, and the Yin yuan has no ups and downs. The Tongli Du yuan one load sold for 8.2 yuan.</p>
<p>(Hubei) Yesterday, there were more than twenty sources from the lower reaches of the river. The sales of white japonica rice were normal on this street, but sluggish in the four rural areas, and the market shape was close to a foot lower. There was not much Bo rice,</p>
<p>and the retail sales were not good, with the price down a little. Early rice showed a slight fatigue, and indica rice was slightly soft.</p>
<p>The white yuan has a firm tone.</p>
<h3>Small Jiao Rice Newly Returned from Hankou</h3>
<p>丨Ke Xian Minhua Activated Again丨</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Ke Xian market was still lively. The Fuzhou group continued to handle foreign shipments,</p>
<p>and the Quanzhou group and this street also had business. The total market opened with about 4,000 bags,</p>
<p>and there seemed to be hope for a turnaround in the market. However, the out-of-town hoarders are all moving their entire stockpiles to Shanghai. A batch of Jiangxi rice also arrived yesterday, but no samples were released.</p>
<p>In addition to Ke Xian, foreign rice was also returned to Shanghai. Yesterday, the Hankou group shipped 2,000 bags of old small Jiao rice. Because the stockpiles in that port were sufficient, in addition to the nearby rice shipments, there was even more Hunan rice, and there was no way to sell the foreign rice. The market fell sharply again and again, even lower than the Shanghai market, so 2,000 bags were shipped back. Wuhu Ji Yuan was also shipped, but there was not much stock on the market. The Min group had an appetite, and the market stabilized. Old small Jiao, 1,000 bags of foreign rice were sold from this street for 7.3 yuan, a little lower than the end of last month. Saigon No. 1 was 100 bags, the price was still 8 yuan. Wuhu Ji Yuan 300 bags sold by the Fuzhou group, the price also did not change. Ke Xian 3,000 bags sold by the Min group, 1,000 bags sold by this street, the market prices were not much different from last weekend.</p>
<h3>Bean Flour Market Re-Enters Sluggish Path</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning, the market for each month was in a stable state. The price of foreign wheat was quoted at around 134 jiao, so the market sentiment was optimistic, and some of the floating long positions were also being purchased. Transactions for each month were slightly busy, with the recent and two months rising by nearly a cent, and the recent months rising by about half a cent. By the time the market opened in the afternoon, the market situation for each month was slightly better. According to market speculation, the silver price in the future may be extended, and the prospects for foreign wheat should be less promising. Therefore, the large and small factories were releasing orders one after another, and the sentiment in the distant months was also affected. Due to the pessimistic northern war situation, the Hakka group also returned, so a sluggish situation reappeared. As a result, this month was down 0.25 li compared to the previous day, May was down 0.5 li, June was down 0.75 li, July was down 0.25 li,</p>
<p>August was up 0.25 li, and September was down 0.5 li.</p>
<h3>A Glimpse of the Decline of the Wheat Bran Market</h3>
<p>The wheat bran market has been in a sluggish state for a long time. Because domestic sales have gradually disappeared, it is due to the economic bankruptcy of the rural areas and the unwillingness of domestic and foreign traders to extend credit, so the decline of the market is becoming more and more serious. Most of the factory's inventory is still handled by the hostile merchants, and a small portion is sold to Fujian, Xiamen, and Shantou. The inland groups are unusually quiet.</p>
<p>Recently, the factory price has fallen to 1.55 yuan with a discount.</p>
<h3>Car Beans Slightly Better, Red Grain Sales Active</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the car bean market was slightly better. Because the cargo owners have suffered too much loss, the downstream transport is sluggish, so the source is temporarily disconnected. The holders are bound to sell it back, and the arrival from Niuzhuang Dalian is not high, so the sentiment has stabilized. Yesterday, the market sold five cars of Zhengyangguan beans, which were purchased by the export groups and factories, with prices ranging from 5.2 yuan to 5.1 yuan. The transaction volume of Du beans and Shahuang was slightly relaxed, but the market remained stable. The source of red grain was scarce, but its sales path was very active. Yesterday, the market and Shaoxing group also inquired, purchasing two cars of high red shell, with prices of 3.49 yuan and 3.47 yuan. The Jiangbei group transacted one car, with a price of 3.46 yuan.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Coarse Granulated White Sugar Weak</h3>
<p>Domestic Brown Sugar Slightly More Advantageous</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market's benchmark price remained unchanged. Due to sluggish sales, market sentiment continued to be weak. The No. 24 coarse granulated white sugar from the association was quoted at $21.20,</p>
<p>while the No. 20 medium granulated white sugar was at $20.06, with no transactions. The No. 8 and 9 Dutch brown sugar had some trading, with prices at $17 to $16.95. Domestic new cotton brown sugar arrived yesterday from Suzhou via two shipments totaling thousands of packages.</p>
<p>On the same day, Chaozhou merchants offered over two hundred packages, with prices ranging from $16.25, $16.20, $16.10 to $15.95.</p>
<p>Sales were relatively active. Hainan brown sugar sold over a hundred packages from Guangdong merchants, with prices at $14.60. Due to low inventory, the market was also firm.</p>
<h3>Cloth and Wool Market: Quiet and Desolate</h3>
<p>Transactions of cloth and wool were very quiet at the association. Demand from various domestic merchants was minimal, as business for retailers was slow and market sales were quite stagnant. Additionally, the approaching end of the month for long-term payments caused tight credit among the industry, with both buyers and sellers eager to liquidate goods for cash. Market prices consequently declined steadily. Currently, the wholesale and retail prices of spring and summer wool fabrics are lower than before, but actual large-scale transactions are rare.</p>
<p>Overall, the market trend yesterday showed a sharp downward turn.</p>
<h3>Metals: Zinc Increased in Line with Fixed Prices</h3>
<p>Due to frequent increases in overseas fixed prices, the local standard price of zinc has also risen. The current fixed price is $38.75, an increase of $1.00 from before. The Shanghai market has also increased to $16.50, up by $0.50 from before. Trading among tea merchants was vigorous, and demand from paint companies and yellow lead factories was also strong. However, export business to Tianjin, Qingdao, and Yantai was affected by the ongoing war in the north.</p>
<p>There was no progress in transactions. Merchants from Changjiang Road and Fujian-Zhejiang areas slightly increased their orders. The market supply is shallow, with few goods arriving, so the outlook for future prices is relatively optimistic.</p>
<h3>Pure Antimony: Arrival of Spot Goods</h3>
<p>Recently, the market in Hunan for pure antimony has been calm, and exports have increased sharply, resulting in a large number of spot goods arriving in Shanghai. Last week's arrivals were particularly high,</p>
<p>totaling 40 to 50 tons. As a result, supply exceeded demand, and the market was sluggish.</p>
<p>The standard price appeared strong externally but was weak internally, selling for $335 per ton, a decrease of over $2 from before. However, retail transactions could still barely fetch $336. Besides minor demand from enamel factories and manufacturers, export business was virtually non-existent. According to Reuters, Russia and Canada are producing large quantities of pure antimony, and European and American markets are mostly occupied. Therefore, apart from Japan, there is no foothold for Chinese goods overseas, making a turnaround in the local market seem difficult.</p>
<h3>White Lead Skins: New Goods Arrive</h3>
<p>Due to a shortage of goods, the market price of white lead skins has risen sharply. Types like No. 2 and No. 5 were particularly scarce, leading to higher prices. Subsequently, purchasers could hardly find goods available. Yesterday, 400 to 500 barrels arrived via the New Taikoo Wharf, easing concerns about market shortages.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea</h3>
<p>News of New Anhui and Zhejiang Tea</p>
<p>Since the Qingming Festival, the tea buds in the mountains around Sui'an for green tea have gradually grown larger. Generally, tea farmers, noting last year's good prices for early buds, plan to start picking earlier this year. It is expected that this year's tea production from this area will be of high quality.</p>
<p>Tea shops have also been busily preparing to open for the season, and tea merchants from various regions have been very active, creating an unusually lively atmosphere.</p>
<h3>Decrease in Tunxi Tea Firms</h3>
<p>Tunxi is an important area for the Anhui tea market. Last year, most tea businesses in this area suffered losses, so tea merchants are not very active this year. Currently, over ten tea firms in Tunxi have decided to cease operations. The remaining forty-eight firms are still operating as usual, but most are adopting a cautious approach.</p>

<h3>On Spring Outings</h3>
<p>— Yu Dafu</p>
<p>The good thing about spring is that people don’t feel like eating much; the bad thing about spring is that people don’t feel like doing much. "Drowsy and dreaming all day," this is the spirit of spring. When drunk and dreaming, one naturally doesn't feel like eating or doing things, but there are exceptions. The gluttonous man of Qi, who begged for food between meals, is an exception that can break this rule. In short, spring is not for studying. With spring clothes ready and spring emotions stirring, outings and tomb sweeping, fulfilling vows and offering incense, seem to be the only proper things to do in spring. Li Bai's preface to the spring night banquet in the peach and plum garden truly captures the psychology of spring. The philosophy of decadent Chinese poets can be seen in this short preface.</p>
<p>However, Li Bai was not just a poet who peddled decadence. In his preface to the night banquet on Tiger Hill on the fifteenth day of the twelfth month, he also explained the reasons for his decadence: "Now, within the court, there are Kui, Long, Gao, and Yi to assist in all affairs of state. Outside, there are Fang Shu and Zhao Hu to defend the four corners of the land. People by the rivers and seas can rest easy and have nothing to worry about. Thus, we can enjoy banquets with friends, playing music and drinking wine, and compose poems under the bright moon. This is the duty of our group..." Looking back at the current situation in China, what is it like? But distant fires seem to never burn the water nearby. The flames of war in North China are, of course, irrelevant to us. Therefore, the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway Bureau can open special spring excursion trains, and movie queens can hold all-night dance parties.</p>
<p>Speaking of outings, they are not inherently bad. The "Monthly Commands" chapter of the Book of Rites says: "In the middle month of summer, one can look far into the distance and climb mountains and hills." Moreover, Confucius traveled north, sighed deeply, and urged his disciples to each express their aspirations. The Grand Historian traveled to famous mountains and great rivers, and his writings were thus accomplished. In medieval Germany, apprentices who completed their apprenticeship had to travel to broaden their horizons. Therefore, after the apprenticeship period (LEHRJAHRE), there was a mandatory period of travel (WANDERJAHRE). This kind of travel is a rewarding journey, a decoration to peaceful times, and should not be criticized. However, given the current state of China, with starving corpses in the suburbs and flames of war everywhere, the question remains whether the idle and propertied classes should be so wasteful.</p>
<p>Although, one can not forget to save the country while enjoying spring, and one can not forget to enjoy spring while saving the country, but is this really true?</p>
<h3>On Daze Village</h3>
<p>— Cao Juren</p>
<p>"Daze Village," "Leopard Head Lin Chong," and "Stone Tablet" are three short stories that Mao Dun wrote in the style of "new wine in old bottles." I think "Stone Tablet" is more successful, while Mao Dun himself feels that "Daze Village" "appears more intimate" (see my "Reminiscences," page 8). "Daze Village" is originally a good subject matter, but Mao Dun's observations are not very accurate; I don't think it should be written that way.</p>
<p>The characters from the Chu-Han Contention can be divided into three groups:</p>
<p>Fan Zeng, Lu Jia, Song Yi, Zhang Liang, and Xiao He make up one group, representing the scholar-official class. Their policy was, "It is better to belong to someone. If things succeed, you can still be ennobled; if things fail, it is easy to escape, and you will not be known by the world." They had a common goal of establishing lords to rally support. Tian Shi, Tian An, Tian Rong, Han Guang, Zhao Wang Xie, and Chu Wang Xin make up another group, representing the fallen gentry. They relied on the scholar-officials' dream of restoring their countries. Xiang Ji, Xiang Liang, Liu Ji, Chen Sheng, Wu Guang, Han Xin, and Peng Yue make up yet another group, representing the rogue class. They were the central figures of that era, each harboring the ambition of "I can take his place." Surrounding these three groups were millions of farmers, whose grievances had been building up and were ready to explode. The rogue class took advantage of this accumulated resentment and seized the opportunity to launch a rebellion.</p>
<p>"Daze Village" is a good subject matter because it can represent the way of peasant revolutions for thousands of years.</p>
<p>The uprising in "Daze Village" was not sudden; it had been planned beforehand. Chen She was an ambitious man who, when farming in his hometown, made promises of "If I become rich, I will not forget you." He knew that his opportunity had come with the rain in "Daze Village." He "falsely claimed that Prince Fusu and Xiang Yu were singing for the world," "placed a silk cloth with writing in the belly of a fish," and "lit bonfires at night and howled like a fox." These were all the tactics of a conspirator and not the consciousness of poor farmers. Mao Dun seems to have overlooked this point. He treated Chen She as an ordinary farmer, and therefore shifted the focus to the two drunken officers, making the shadow very faint.</p>
<p>When writing historical novels, one can certainly inject new meaning, but it should not deviate too much from historical facts. The peasant revolution in "Daze Village" contained two kinds of consciousness: one was the resistance of the poor farmers against the nobles, and the other was the resistance of the Chu people against the Qin people. Let's look at the scholar-official class at that time, who all spoke of establishing a Chu ruler. This kind of national consciousness certainly had a rallying power for the farmers at that time. It was not until Liu Ji and Xiang Yu took the center stage as the rogue class that the national resistance sentiment declined. When writing about "Daze Village," if these two kinds of consciousness are not properly interwoven, as Mao Dun did by only writing about one kind of consciousness, it will obscure the truth of the matter. In Chinese peasant revolutionary movements, the peasants are often unconscious, so they are often taken advantage of by others. The "Biography of Chen She" in the Records of the Grand Historian clearly says, "The soldiers often talked among themselves, all pointing at Chen Sheng. Wu Guang was always kind to people, and many soldiers were willing to work for him." This is clear evidence of the successful exploitation of farmers. But Mao Dun says, "However, they were only surprised.</p>
<p>They had no illusions. They had already tasted enough of the idea of supporting someone as 'king.' All they hoped for was to break the chains that bound them." This is definitely not the Chinese peasant, and even less so the Chinese peasant of that time. Writing it this way cuts off the link between the rogue class and the peasants.</p>
<p>There are many other scattered opinions that I will not write down. I now want to try to fill a new wine into the old bottle.</p>
<h3>"We Can Wait Fifty Years"</h3>
<p>— Yang Xingzhi</p>
<p>Not long ago, Dr. Hu Shih, a "high-class Chinese," wrote an article in "Independent Review" advocating direct negotiations with Japan. Except for "certain conditions," the goal of the negotiations should be: "To abolish the puppet state of Manchukuo and restore China's territorial and administrative sovereignty over the three northeastern provinces and Jehol." But why should this be the goal? "The reason is very simple," namely, "First, we must be consistent with the League of Nations and the United States' 'non-recognition doctrine'; second, we should not abandon the League of Nations."</p>
<p>Dr. Hu's proposal is certainly clever. First, he can use the four words "direct negotiations" to completely eliminate the national revolutionary war of resisting Japanese imperialism. Second, he can use the four words "certain conditions" to sell the entire Chinese nation as pigs and dogs. Third, he cleverly uses "being consistent with the League of Nations and the United States" as a footnote to "the goal of negotiations should be to abolish the puppet state of Manchukuo and restore China's territorial,</p>
<p>and administrative sovereignty over the three northeastern provinces and Jehol." This means that it doesn't matter if our country is conquered, but we must be consistent with our masters, because our masters have not told us to recognize Manchukuo, and we still have many things to rely on our masters for, and we must not break away from their embrace.</p>
<p>In this way, all Chinese people below our group of "high-class Chinese" will understand the principle of "masters first, nation second," and from then on, they will all bow their heads and listen quietly to the orders of their masters, and wait quietly to be slaughtered by their masters. Ah, we should thank Dr. Hu for his revelation and his plan.</p>
<p>However, this clever plan has now failed. Based on "experimentalism," this plan has already failed, first because the "lower-class Chinese" still dare to not allow the government authorities to act as Li Hongzhang today, and second because, according to Japanese Minister to China Arima, "Now that Japan has withdrawn from the League of Nations, if China and Japan negotiate directly,</p>
<p>it will invisibly raise China's international status," clearly "disdaining" to negotiate directly with China. In this way, our doctor's clever plan has failed.</p>
<p>What does it matter if it fails? Let's try another one. In short, we must not allow an anti-Japanese national revolutionary war. Since Japan does not allow us to negotiate, we should "wait for death." So our doctor shouted in the 44th issue of "Independent Review," "We can wait fifty years!"</p>
<p>What is the meaning of "waiting fifty years"? First, of course, it is still not allowed to move, not allowed to resist. Second, it is only allowed to watch Manchukuo being established, not allowed to "recover." Third, it is allowed to let the Japanese take whatever they want. For fifty years, or perhaps for an infinite number of years, we are not allowed to move. Being a slave means being a slave for a lifetime.</p>
<p>Because "the support of righteousness in the whole world is on our side, and the moral condemnation of the whole world is on the heads of our enemies." This means that the masters are also not very satisfied with Japan's "exclusive possession" of Manchuria, and at the same time they are very satisfied that we are willing to be slaughtered and have no resistance at all. Therefore, "our final victory is beyond any doubt." Final victory, okay, we just need to have this little bit of "confidence." Doesn't it matter what we do? What does fifty years matter? Our days as slaves are still long!</p>
<p>Mr. He Jiagan wrote in a poem, "A parrot that can speak is as poisonous as a snake." I think our "parrot" is "clever" because he can make a clever footnote to "long-term resistance," he can make a better reassurance pill, he can make a more ingenious smoke screen. Ah, our parrot, our doctor, our high-class Chinese!</p>
<p>However, I heard that recently Yosuke Matsuoka went from Geneva to Washington to lobby the United States to place China under joint control. Therefore, former U.S. Undersecretary of State Cassel attributed the new interpretation of the Stimson Doctrine. Former U.S. Department of Commerce Far East Director Adler even publicly advocated that the three northeastern provinces should be governed by Japan. From this point of view, the masters seem to have changed their minds and seem to be planning to divide the spoils peacefully with Japan. What should we do then? Ah, our doctor, our living treasure.</p>
<h3>On the Way Home (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Liu Zeng</p>
<p>The Longhua Pagoda, which I haven't seen for many years, is now very beautiful in my eyes, clearly depicted on the thin background of the painting. Three years ago, on a similarly drizzly spring afternoon, I wandered alone in Parc de Laeken, a suburb of the Belgian capital. I thought the Japanese tower built there was also quite unique and lingered to admire it for a long time. Now, facing this handsome Longhua Pagoda, the Japanese tower in my memory seems a little short and clumsy.</p>
<p>Qingming has just passed, and new soil has been added to many tombs along the road. Previously, these kinds of things would not have attracted my attention. Even if I noticed them, I would have felt some disgust. But now it is different, because the person I love the most has also entered this world, so even the unrelated mounds of other people's graves seem to have some connection with me, and I look at them with kind and affectionate eyes.</p>
<p>The car passed through a small stream. Along the stream, rows of peach and willow trees, which just a few days ago had only some green buds on their branches, are now colorful and dressed in charming spring clothes. A few fast-growing willow trees already have slender branches swaying in the wind.</p>
<p>The further the car travels away from the city, the more peach and willow trees are sent from the fields and vegetable plots. Sometimes you can even see dozens or hundreds of neatly arranged peach orchards, but the densely packed flowers in full bloom are so vulgar red that they are unpleasant to look at. It is better to have only willow trees with green leaves, which appear simple and lovely.</p>
<p>Speaking of willow trees, they are truly the most poetic and picturesque plants. In Europe, although willow trees are not often seen, the words "SAUIE" and "WILLOW" in Western languages are like "yang liu" in Chinese, often seen in poems. When my wife was alive, she loved to recite Musset's famous work:</p>
<p>My dear friends, when I am dead,</p>
<p>Please plant a willow tree on my grave.</p>
<p>I love its tearful, dense branches and leaves,</p>
<p>The pale color makes me feel dear and tender.</p>
<p>It will also have light shadows</p>
<p>Covering the desolate hill where I lie.</p>
<p>Now that the willow is green and the person is gone, recalling Musset's poem alone in the car is like my wife speaking. The past is like a dream, how can I not weep!</p>
<p>I don't know when two foreign young men came up into the car, with thin faces and tall statures, they looked like Englishmen. It is rare for this city bus to carry a few foreigners in a year, and the appearance of these two white men caused surprise among many small merchants and landlords in the car. Everyone stared at them intently, murmuring and talking. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>The Crossroads of Era and Love</h3>
<p>— Zhang Ziping</p>
<p>He decided to go to the publishing house organized by Li Yixiang and Chen Huamin to see those literary friends and inquire about the news of the comrades who were arrested this afternoon. The publishing house was located in Hongkou, within the sphere of influence of Japanese imperialism. It would take at least an hour to get there from here. But Haiquan, who had nowhere to go tonight, decided to go there to spend the night.</p>
<p>When he arrived at their publishing house, it was already half past eight. Most of the partners in the publishing house had gone out to play. Only two or three less important staff members were still there reading or scribbling. Haiquan had been there several times and knew them, so he greeted them. But they were cold and didn't pay much attention to Haiquan. Haiquan asked them where Mr. Li Yixiang lived, and they all said they didn't know. He then asked if Mr. Li would come here tonight, but they didn't give a definite answer. Haiquan felt bored and just flipped through the newspapers in the reading room and looked at the social science books they published. He looked until nine thirty and was about to go back to Cao Shiguang's house when he suddenly heard a burst of footsteps in the corridor outside.</p>
<p>"I'm afraid they're going to come and search. It's best to be more mature."</p>
<p>"There's no problem, right?"</p>
<p>Haiquan clearly heard Mr. Chen Huamin's voice.</p>
<p>"What are you afraid of? What are you afraid of? There's no such barbaric way!"</p>
<p>This time it was Mr. Li Yixiang's voice.</p>
<p>"But imperialists don't reason."</p>
<p>"There's nothing in our society anyway. Let them come and check! They won't seal us up. No matter what, they won't be so barbaric."</p>
<p>Haiquan came out to see that behind Mr. Chen and Mr. Li were also four or five second- or third-rate writers. Haiquan couldn't help but envy this group of famous writers. They all sat down in the living room. Haiquan also came in, first called out to Li Yixiang, and then nodded to Chen Huamin and called him Mr. Chen.</p>
<p>"Ah, you've come."</p>
<p>Li Yixiang seemed surprised to see Haiquan.</p>
<p>"Mr. Li, how did you escape back?"</p>
<p>Haiquan asked with a smile.</p>
<p>"Joke! Why escape? Would those police officers dare to arrest people randomly?"</p>

<h3>Nude Dance</h3>
<p>— Tianfang</p>
<p>I have always had a preference when reading newspapers, which is to read the advertisements before reading the news. The first, of course, is to see if there are any new books published, and the second is to know a little about the methods of publicly scolding people, such as you say I take bribes, I accuse you of slander, or reveal some of other people's secrets as evidence that my goods are genuine and of good quality. Because I have paid the money, I can speak much more freely and happily, which is more truthful and revealing than the news reported by interviewers.</p>
<p>This is my reason for liking to read advertisements.</p>
<p>Recently, this preference seems to be even greater. The reason is also very simple: the pages are filled with "national salvation," "resolutions," "telegrams," and "new Chen lines," which have made me a little tired. Although a certain general told us that "internal worries and external troubles are not to be feared,"</p>
<p>this heart is still quite uneasy, probably a sign of "being dead."</p>
<p>Yesterday, as usual, I flipped through the newspapers one by one, and in the advertisements for "engagement," "obituary," and "denial of slander," I found the following advertisement, which I hereby transcribe for public viewing:</p>
<p>Our theater has been overcrowded since the screening of XXX and the French nude dance, and we have been unable to accommodate all the viewers. Every show has had over a thousand people turned away. Our theater feels very sorry for this. Viewers are requested to arrive early to avoid disappointment.</p>
<p>Although this is an advertisement, and the purpose is perhaps mainly to encourage people to "arrive early," the crowding of the audience is at least half true. Since the "artistic traitor" Liu and the "commander-in-chief of the five-province allied forces" Sun handled the nude negotiations, this trend has become very popular. The eyes of ordinary people are not on the beauty of art, but only seek the nudity of the "jade body," which may be an expression of "dogs grabbing carpets." As for "dancing," it is even more impossible without "nudity," let alone "nuding" a "beautiful and young" "French woman," so its popularity is self-evident. It also contains the meaning of respecting imported goods.</p>
<p>What is "apologetic" is that every show has "no less than a thousand" "viewers" turned away, craning their necks outside the venue, wanting to get close to the "beauty" but unable to do so. Seeing this is truly pitiful, so not only the theater owner feels "sorry," but even the newspaper reader feels injustice on their behalf. Here, I can't help but feel that the great wish to "sacrifice beauty" is still limited by material things, which should be improved by the theater owners who are responsible for promoting "aesthetic artification." Fortunately, there are so many dance troupes now, truly no less than "mushrooms after rain," and they are all "beautiful and young," and although they are not "French," many are "foreign-born" and all are willing to "sacrifice their beauty." "Fat buttocks tremble, endlessly changing, able to melt the soul of Liu Hui: Curves are slightly presented, enough to intoxicate the souls of men from Lu. Looking at their bodies makes people dizzy and confused, their hearts swayed and their minds extinguished; being near them is like the fragrance of musk orchids, making people limp and weak..." (original text from a certain theater advertisement, author's annotations). Just seeing this advertisement is enough to make people "float," and the "satisfaction" is roughly the same. There is no shortage of "beautiful and young" women, and as long as you make a grand wish, anyone can be nude and be welcomed in the same way, so the supply is not likely to cause a major panic, which is reassuring. Finally, I would like to take this opportunity to post a free advertisement on behalf of major theaters. I guarantee with my reputation that this is indeed the only anesthetic for people in semi-colonial countries under the heavy oppression of imperialism. If you have already written a "confession" of "never resisting," then it is very worthwhile to spend a few dimes to "arrive early" |late will "disappoint" | in order to vent the anger in your stomach.</p>
<p>Random: The affairs of the country are so muddled, why don't I seek happiness?</p>
<p>The booming of the cannons, how can it be as pleasant as Pina's voice?</p>
<p>Since the passing of Xia Yu, the nude country can still be found;</p>
<p>May the "beauty" be always close, why bother to value the past and despise the present?</p>
<h3>The Abrogation of Taels and Adoption of Yuan: An Abacus Tactic</h3>
<p>— Luo Zhensheng</p>
<p>Since April 6th, with the abrupt implementation of abolishing taels and adopting yuan, all silver transactions must be calculated using 0.715 as the exchange rate. This is especially cumbersome for those working in the financial sector. I have now devised a quick method to share with readers. Although some have already published on this, this method is still incomplete. If one can practice it thoroughly, it is much more convenient than repeatedly dividing by 0.715. I will provide specific examples below:</p>
<p>Convert 1,000 taels into yuan: Multiply by 1.4, resulting in 1,400 yuan. Then, in the fourth position from the right, subtract 14, yielding 1,398 yuan and 6 jiao. For values like 10,000, 100,000, 1 million, or 10 million taels, add 13,986 in the seventh position from the right, then skip seven positions and add 13,986 again, rounding to the nearest fen. It is perfectly accurate. For instance, to convert 15,000 taels, multiply by 1.4, obtaining 21,000 yuan. Subtract 12 in the fourth position from the right, resulting in 20,979 yuan and 2 fen. By extrapolating from this and practicing diligently, it will be faster than repeatedly dividing by 0.715. Gentlemen, why not give it a try?</p>
<p>(Principle) Converting 100 taels to yuan using 0.715 yields 139 yuan, 8 jiao, and 6 fen. Adding 14 to the fourth position results in 140 yuan. Extrapolating from this, multiply the original value in taels by 1.4, then subtract the number obtained by multiplying by 14 from the fourth position from the right. This yields the equivalent amount in yuan. If the silver amount is in the tens of thousands, add the obtained yuan amount to the seventh position from the right (rounding). If the silver amount is in the tens of millions, skip another seven positions and add the yuan amount again. (Gratitude)</p>

<h3>A Trip to West Lake?</h3>
<p>— Kuang Bei</p>
<p>It's already the third month of late spring. Young men and women escaping the confines of steam-heated rooms are eager to try on their 1933 spring attire and stroll into the countryside to appreciate the scenery. Life is always so harmonious, fresh, lively, and lovable. It's said that the spring scenery of Jiangnan is exceptionally captivating. "Spring grass green, spring water green waves" are elegant lines from the ancients. And "Late spring, third month, Jiangnan grass grows, various flowers bloom on trees, a flock of orioles flies wildly" is an even more vivid depiction. Yes, "Face the wine, sing a song, how long is life?" Why not seize the moment and have a good time? The ancients even had the refined pastime of "holding a candle to wander at night." Are we really going to let even the daytime pass in vain?</p>
<p>I hear that "West Lake Madness" has been all the rage for weeks. In the spring of Jiangnan, West Lake is indeed uniquely beautiful. Having roamed the seas for a full five years, I have long been deeply impressed by it, and I often yearn for the tomb by the lake—that of Master Manshu, the author of "Broken Geese and Lost Swans." But I have never been there in person.</p>
<p>This time, this year, Mr. X started trying to get train tickets from the railway bureau half a month ago. I also rashly agreed to accompany him. Time flies like a shuttle. Last night, Mr. X came to tell me that the tickets were secured and that we would leave early on the 17th. He asked if I had prepared a few yuan for spending money. I suddenly woke up from a deep dream and blurted out that I wasn't going. I truly regret disappointing Mr. X. Is it because I can't scrape together a few yuan? Not at all! It's already late spring, and the weather is turning warm. I can simply roll up the bedding on the bed and send it to the pawnshop. Even if it doesn't fetch five or ten yuan, three yuan would be enough. That way, I wouldn't have to beg others and be met with a nose full of ashes, with a barrage of excuses like, "Difficult, difficult, it's really difficult right now. If you wait a few more days, maybe I can come up with something."</p>
<p>So why am I not going? I just feel that in these times when the war drums are pounding in the distance, and everyone is in such dire straits, I really shouldn't have such leisurely whims. Even if I don't emulate the ancients who "slept on firewood and tasted gall," I should be a little more serious. In this era, "leisurely whims" are only for the likes of General XX, who, fulfilling an engagement with a foreign envoy, goes hunting in the countryside. How can I, a mere commoner, aspire to that?</p>
<p>However, last night I dreamed of West Lake again. But I was only standing on the embankment by the lake, staring intently, without moving my feet even half a step. What rippled in my eyes was neither the beauty of West Lake, nor the brilliance of spring, nor the lushness of the vegetation, nor the fragrance of the flowers, nor the swallows chatting and orioles warbling over the water, but rather the cuckoos crying blood and mountain torrents roaring. The groups of people writhing on the lake's surface and the hillside, I saw them clearly: they were corpses. And so I cried, not because my feet couldn't move, but because my mouth couldn't shout, only gurgling in my throat, unable to awaken those crowds of pleasure-seekers. Even if they don't know the hatred of a fallen nation, they should remotely listen, remotely listen to the sound of cannons from beyond the border, and see if it's escaping to the borderlands or rushing into the interior. I became anxious and panicked. Suddenly, a tall, thin shadow shot out in front of me. Someone was patting my shoulder: "You kid, why are you so foolish? Isn't this a world of singing and dancing now? Besides the cannons beyond the border shouting, shouting, what use is there anyway? You have to know that the sound of cannons from beyond the border can't penetrate the eardrums of the people, unless disaster comes to their own homes, see what happens, young man, let me take you to indulge and sink together, don't be foolish here!" "Thank you! My feet can't move, you go ahead!" After I replied, I still stared intently, staring at the corpse like a swarm of bees, suddenly, "Boom!" A heavy sound, as if it fell in the center of West Lake, the lake water splashing in all directions, and the people on the rampage all came to an end, I woke up suddenly, opened my eyes, the room had sparse sunlight jumping, I quickly put on my coat, got out of bed and started the busyness of life.</p>
<h3>The Principal's Guard</h3>
<p>— Bai Tao</p>
<p>A principal having a guard, the principal's guard actually detaining professors, privately imprisoning and brutally beating them, and all the faculty and students in the entire school are actually under the guns of the principal's guard, with no way to appeal for help. This is truly a shocking thing, and it can also be said to be a peculiar spectacle in the Chinese education world. If you don't believe it, please see the telegram from the entire faculty and students of National Sun Yat-sen University in Hong Kong on the 14th, supporting the tragic case of the forest farm:</p>
<p>The text of the telegram roughly says: Because a certain Zhang, the acting captain of the forest police team of the forest farm, privately dismissed five forest police officers, Hou, the professor and director of the forest farm, ordered the captain to reinstate the dismissed forest police officers because he had dismissed them without cause. As a result, Zou Libing, the nephew of Principal Zou and the captain of the forest police team, gathered more than ten members of the principal's guard and went straight to the forest farm, threatening Director Hou and forest farm staff members Huang and Lai with pistols aimed at their chests. Then, they detained Director Hou in the principal's office, falsely accusing Huang and Lai of being communists, brutally beating and seriously injuring them, and then locking them in the school police office with iron chains and large locks. Affairs Director Zou Jiu-cheng deliberately indulged evil and fostered traitors. Only after the faculty and students signed a petition and begged bitterly did they release the two men for medical treatment, and so on...</p>
<p>It was a chaotic and tumultuous situation. This ignorant person thought that the university had suddenly turned into a command headquarters or a detention center. Fortunately, the entire faculty and students signed a petition and begged bitterly, otherwise the lives of Professor Hou and Messrs. Huang and Lai would have been in great danger! However, Messrs. Huang and Lai had already been brutally beaten and seriously injured, and they had been chained with iron locks. Professor Hou was also imprisoned in the principal's office, and he had tasted the flavor of iron bars in the university!</p>
<p>Fortunately, this person's family is poor and cannot afford to go to university, otherwise I would be terrified of being imprisoned and becoming a prisoner in the school police office, where I would have to shout: "......</p>
<p>Seeking guarantees for more than 4,000 faculty and students, preserving the dignity of the sacred institution of learning, seeking the extension of human rights, ......" and enduring pain and sacrifice there, respectfully requesting national cultural organizations to uphold justice and provide sympathy and assistance! Not only would I be unable to study, but I would also have to anxiously call for help from the outside world for the sake of extending human rights. This is precisely where evil is being done!</p>
<p>If it really comes to a point where there is no way to appeal for help under the guns of the principal's guard, then one is not going to "study,"</p>
<p>but rather to "study death"! Alas!</p>

<h3>Spilled Water Can Be Recovered</h3>
<p>Dear Editor:</p>
<p>I am a junior employee in a certain large store, 22 years old this year, and my monthly income is still abundant. I now have an extremely difficult problem to solve: when I was seventeen years old, my family arranged a marriage for me; at that time, I was still young, so I did not comment on this matter. The other party is also eighteen years old this year, so I originally intended to get married this winter. Last year, the other party was still studying at school and was seduced by a certain male classmate; at the end of last year, they agreed to elope and sent a letter requesting the other party's father to propose to my family to terminate the engagement; my father naturally agreed, and the engagement was terminated accordingly. Now, because the family of a certain male classmate does not allow the woman to return to her mother's home. After this, many people came to say, "Her previous conduct was excellent, and she was also intelligent, but she was temporarily bewitched by someone, and now she has completely repented,</p>
<p>I sincerely hope that my family can forgive her and reconnect the kinship of Qin and Jin." Her learning and character are indeed very good. She has completely repented, and I personally think that it is okay to re-establish the old agreement. However, people at home are absolutely opposed, saying how "reputation is at stake" and so on. If I really marry her, will it really affect my reputation? Please give me a reply. (omitted below)</p>
<p>Wang Yunlai respectfully submitted</p>
<p>X X X X</p>
<p>Editor's note: Whether Wang Jun's counterpart can really repent cannot be based entirely on the rumors of others; you must carefully investigate it yourself. If she really repents, then you can marry her without any harm. If her repentance is only out of necessity, then the results in the future will be terrible. As for the layer of reputation, because there are still many stubborn people in the current society, it is inevitable that it will be affected by them. However, this is a mistake in their concept, and you can ignore it!</p>
<p>Finally, we believe that a woman's social interaction can of course be open, but it is really necessary to avoid losing her body to others casually. Because after one mistake, even if you are ashamed and regretful, who can forgive you immediately?</p>

<h3>Time in Dreams (Thirty-one Continued)</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>The students, one by one, were startled by the bell and crowded into the auditorium. Wu Yi also passed through the crowd and sat on the guidance seat together with the Dean of Academic Affairs, the Dean of Student Affairs, the Dean of the Faculty of Arts, and several important professors.</p>
<p>At that time, on a large lecture platform in the center, there were already two students with very激烈的 attitudes, like escorts,押着 a Qing dynasty youth with a very fine clothing, a pale complexion, and a drooping head, standing behind a row of circular chairs.</p>
<p>"Ah! Is that him? He really did such a shameless deed!" To Wu Yi's right sat Zhou Xichen, his old classmate from the United States, who had been hired by him as the Dean of the School of Business last year. Zhou Xichen recognized that the so-called "敗類" being watched on the stage, who "destroyed the reputation of the whole body and obstructed the freight inspection movement", was one of the most調的 students in the Banking Department of their School of Business, and with a kind of "I knew he was unreliable"</p>
<p>With such a tone, I lamented.</p>
<p>"What's his name?" Wu Yi asked absentmindedly.</p>
<p>His name should be Wang Guodong, Zhou Xichen replied.</p>
<p>"Ah! Wang Guodong"! Wu Yi's expression suddenly changed. He stood up straight and jumped off his seat,</p>
<p>His nearsighted eyes widened twice as large as usual. His arms were crossed in front of his chest, like a boxer standing upright. At that time, all the members and cadres of the Student Union had arrived and went up to the stage one by one, sitting on both sides of the chair position. These ten or so people, in Wu Yi's fading eyes, had become ten or so different poses of Ms. Mao Jufen; some were smiling at him, some were frowning, and some were hugging a child to breastfeed, ...... In short, at this moment, his brain and nerves were filled with Ms. Mao's past voice and smile!</p>
<p>He remembered that three years ago, when he was still a puppet, Wang Yulin had written him a letter,</p>
<p>The general idea is: "The puppy Yulin, a student of Guo-dong, lost his mother in his early years, (Ms. Mao died in the second year Wu Yi came to Nanjing) lacking people to teach, his nature is special. He has been admitted to your school of business, and I beg you to take care of him at any time.</p>
<p>......" However, at that time, Wu Yi not only lost his power, but was also unable to take care of him, and he drank and drank all day long. He didn't take this matter to heart. Xiang thought that today, he would meet each other on a narrow road! How could he not panic and panic?</p>
<p>He also remembered that when Xiao Lin was four years old, he was already able to come and go alone. Because Jufen loved him so much, she always held him like a one- or two-year-old child. The hot weather made her sweat all over!</p>
<p>Also no complaint; once, she solemnly told Wu Yi: "You must sincerely love my Xiao Lin,</p>
<p>For example, if your son and Xiao Lin fall into the water at the same time, you must save Xiao Lin first, and then save your son. This is my good friend"! At that time, Wu Yi also gave her a satisfactory reply, he said: "I will love him as you do"!</p>
<p>Now that Jufen is dead, these few words are still echoing in his ears, but in such a situation, how can he偏護 his "lover's son".</p>

<h3>Where Are Our Works with a Strong Sense of Consciousness?</h3>
<p>— Qian Taisheng</p>
<p>It is undeniable that the year 1933 may be the year when our decadent and confused film industry turns around and awakens. Looking at the recent works of various companies, from "A Woman's Cry" recently released to "Vitality" about to be released, and the previously released works such as "Three Modern Women", "City Night", "Morning in the Metropolis", "Raging Torrent" and so on, we can find that they are standing on the same</p>
<p>The front is to make more life-affirming works.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that they want to seize this dynamic and active era and give a painful attack on the so-called capitalist society, and want to use the same subject matter to clarify the significance of the new life of workers and peasants! However, by making a rigorous analysis of all the works,</p>
<p>We cannot but admit that they have only a partial success.</p>
<p>In "A Woman's Cry", the director obviously did not grasp the main part of the whole play, so the whole play is inevitably shrouded in a hazy veil, and the most tense completion of the whole play is missed in the loose part of the whole play. It is said that there are also many scenes introducing the life of female workers in "Vitality", and we don't want to say anything before it is released.</p>
<p>In "Three Modern Women", it tells us that the most "modern" women are the women who are advancing and revolutionizing, and what is introduced on the screen is a painting of a worker's wharf, saying that this is the suffering of workers' lives! In the ending scene, the consciousness is especially unhealthy. It writes that this young young master can give up his life of arbitrary enjoyment and leave the city with his beloved female worker. Although it wants to show the awakening of the young master, it actually only writes that the young master is infatuated and crazy for this beautiful female worker. The reason why he left his usual life of bourgeois pleasure is not revolution, not light, but only fascination for a woman.</p>
<p>What do "City Night" and "Morning in the Metropolis" tell us? One ending slogan is: "Everyone go back to the countryside!" One result is to write "Go to the light!" But where is the countryside? What is "our" place of light? What is the place where the general working class of farmers and workers is not squeezed and exploited? Is "Peach Blossom Garden" and "Paradise" the same fantasy as this "countryside" or "place of light"?</p>
<p>What "Raging Torrent" writes is an exposure of the crime of rural composition, and the formation of a great flood. It writes about the violent and dangerous gentlemen in the countryside, and it writes about who is the culprit of the great flood. But whether the culprit it writes is the real culprit, or only a sinner created by the environment, and cannot bear the name of the culprit</p>
<p>The above-mentioned works, their reference to new themes, cannot but make us feel sympathetic, but in the result of the performance, the positive introduction of depicting workers and rural areas has been neglected, and it has become a work with vague consciousness, which is indeed the most regrettable fact in our emerging film industry in 1933.</p>
<p>However, as far as the production company is concerned, according to what we know, "Three Modern Women" once had a scene of a large-scale strike by telephone female workers; the "Raging Torrent" was originally a scene of peasant riots, which were all deleted. The company is afraid of touching the authorities' taboo, so they have to go in a gentle direction; but because they use new themes and consciousness, they have to make newer works, and the result is this contradictory performance that makes people feel neither painful nor itchy.</p>
<p>In this squeezed environment, in this sour and bitter era, when can we see a work with a strong sense of consciousness?</p>
<p>Audience opinion</p>
<h3>Feelings After Watching "The Spring Colors of the Luoyang Palace"</h3>
<p>— Jianan</p>
<p>The masses who succumb to the iron hooves will never end up埋首, swallowing and weeping, they have latent strength. Once they get a considerable opportunity, they will erupt like a volcano and attack and struggle with their objects to seek their "way out". At that time, their leaders all have great spirits such as sincerity, opposition, and sacrifice. The士斯,维丝, and the nurse密茜亚 in this film are all good examples, especially密茜亚 is more commendable for being able to sacrifice love, wealth, not to妥恊 with the cruel monarch, and to die for the religion that she and a group of comrades have always believed in. Only such a great spirit can move Ma Ke, the local official who was once赫赫一时, to abandon his luck and join their battle line.</p>
<p>The final decision of all political cases is manipulated in the hands of ignorant women. This kind of stupid phenomenon cannot be blamed solely on the rulers of the monarchy era, but is an epitome of the general rulers of ancient and modern China and foreign countries. As for the strange phenomenon of cannibalism and the evil struggle between humans and animals, it is especially the consistent policy of the general imperialists who sow it on the ignorant and powerless nations who do not know how to save themselves 丨 the clever西席地密耳, he is unwilling to put them 丨 how the rulers will collapse and what the result will be, he frankly performed it, I am afraid that they themselves will be touched and imagined.</p>
<p>The tension of the whole play, the skills of the director, as well as the actors, scenery, photography, etc., have already been evaluated by someone in this magazine, so there is no need to write more here. In short, this film is not as mysterious as the advertisement stipulates that children under the age of seventeen are not allowed to visit, nor is it as sensual as the film title tells us. But it is a blockbuster that is greater and more meaningful than "Ben-Hur", "The Ten Commandments", and "The King of Kings".</p>
<p>In the scene of "Desire",蕭伐洛夫 said to the Gypsy girl:</p>
<p>"You are Princess妲拉喀挪華"</p>
<h3>After watching "A Woman's Cry"</h3>
<p>— Li Qiong</p>
<p>Regarding "A Woman's Cry", it is obviously based on the theme of women's liberation. So our women are really worthy of concern. When I walked out of the Central Theater after watching this film, I felt that the screenwriter was very clear about the current situation of our petty bourgeoisie women in China. But we are not satisfied with this; why? Because in fact, Chinese women are already "shouting" loudly, and it is by no means the time to "shout" as the film says. What's more, this film has not yet "shouted" out. In other words: it is that the producer's instructions for the way out are so empty and ambiguous. A revolutionary woman, Shaoying, should be a major figure in the play, but the director only said a few words about her in the subtitles, which is of course very insufficient. When the heroine Ye Lian has gone through several stimuli and is determined to strive and fight against the evil forces, then she must be a strong and brave typical woman who resists, but what is shown in the play is a shameful and very timid girl, at most it is just unwilling to be downgraded in personality. At the same time, is this idealistic concept of chastity more important than other more important issues? Secondly, at the end of the film, the director very seriously took a picture of the statue of peace on the Bund, which is really incomprehensible, is it saying that as long as Ye Lian is aware, it will be world peace immediately? If so, it will make us suspect that the director is too nervous.</p>
<p>However, as a whole, this "A Woman's Cry" is after all a new work that grasps the times, so we still have great hopes for the producers of this film.</p>
<h3>"A Woman's Cry" – Where Does the Cry Come From?</h3>
<p>— Xi Zong</p>
<p>The awareness expressed in "A Woman's Cry" cannot be said to be distorted; however, in terms of performance technique and structure, it is a failure! One reason is that the screenwriter lacks real-life experience, but also, experience is indeed a major factor. This kind of "woman's cry," even if the throat is hoarse from shouting, will never awaken the two hundred million sleeping female compatriots! Truly, rather than calling it "A Woman's Cry," it would be more appropriate to call it "The Oppression of Women."</p>
<p>The scenes unfolded on the screen do not show any kind of "cry," nor do they indicate a bright future. The female protagonist, Ye Lian, enters society and encounters only suffering and oppression. This can hardly be called a "cry"; the "cry" simply does not exist.</p>
<p>There are also some contradictions and errors here: for example, when Wang Dama steals a bracelet from Ye Lian's house after the robbery, the bracelet would never be placed in a drawer of an empty cabinet, because the robbers would have ransacked the place and would not have left the bracelet behind. These are some contradictions; after Ye Lian's younger sister is deceived and locked in a room, her hair is sometimes permed and sometimes childlike – these are some errors.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Plans to Establish a Film Bureau</h3>
<p>— Zhao Kuangyin</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education recently accepted the suggestions of Chu Minyi and Chen Guofu to establish a Film Bureau, hoping to thoroughly improve China's film industry. After repeated discussions, the Ministry decided to merge and reorganize the existing film censorship committees of the two departments within the Ministry to establish a National Film Bureau. The drafting of the regulations has been handed over to the Secretariat. Its future work will be divided into: (1) compiling film scripts that promote national spirit and depict the hardships of the people, for adoption by film companies nationwide; (2) producing films that promote national spirit and depict the lives of the people, for rental and purchase by theaters nationwide;</p>
<p>(3) producing films about various national undertakings, for broadcasting in various countries.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, "A Woman's Cry" is not as good as "Torrent" and "Flower of Freedom."</p>
<h3>Silver Blossoms</h3>
<p>— Qingzhu</p>

<p>Cai Chusheng's work following "Morning in the Metropolis" has been named "Song of the Fishermen." It will use the lives of fishermen as its background. The script is being written by Cai himself and will begin work by the end of this month.</p>
<h3>The Film Novel "Tarakonova" (7)</h3>
<p>— Meihua</p>
<p>After sending Tarakonova to the monastery, Orlov's soul continued to follow her. He always felt uneasy about sending her to the monastery. He secretly went to the monastery several times to see Tarakonova, but this girl, scarred in both mind and body, could no longer see him! He was repeatedly rejected. He sighed deeply at this solemn monastery, lowered his head, and walked slowly, imagining Princess Tarakonova lying inside, wondering if she was still sighing or resentful.</p>
<p>In fact, Tarakonova would not resent him; not only would she not resent him, but she loved him wholeheartedly! When she lay alone in bed, listening to the church bells, she would think of the palace on the coast of Italy! She would think of the cheering scenes when Orlov invited her onto the warship. Yes, everything still appeared before her eyes, but where was Orlov?</p>
<p>"Oh, my love, will you ever come?" she moaned weakly; sometimes hearing the chirping of birds in the courtyard, she suspected it was Orlov's voice; sometimes, when the door creaked, she imagined it was Orlov's footsteps. Her eye sockets had sunken deeply, her cheekbones were frighteningly high, she yearned, she opened her eyes wide in hope, and that last spark of desire still burned like a flame!</p>
<p>Orlov finally came! Everyone knew that this might be their last meeting. Not allowing them to meet would leave them with lifelong grief that they could not bear even in death; but allowing them to meet was against the rules. Finally, a screen was set up in front of her bed! Orlov lowered his head, walking into the prison cell like a criminal. His heart ached, he was filled with remorse, he wanted to rush forward and embrace her, crying bitterly! But he thought of having already committed one sin, and he shouldn't add to his crimes. He could only lower his head and shout, "Tarakonova, please forgive me!" Hearing this voice, which was so familiar, she knew it was Orlov; "Oh, my love, I still love you!" But she could no longer speak, her lips quivered, and a faint smile appeared on her pale face. She knew in her heart that Orlov had come to her bedside, but poor Orlov, he did not have the chance to see her last smile.</p>
<p>As Orlov walked slowly out of the monastery, the sound of a mournful song was carried on the wind. He cocked his ear and listened, looking inside with both eyes. A dark figure lay on a stretcher, and four nuns were weeping, heading straight for the mortuary, with Princess Possetti wiping away tears with a handkerchief, weeping behind.</p>
<p>Orlov's dark shadow also disappeared with this mournful sound. (The End)</p>

<h3>Key Points of the Latest Library Architecture (2)</h3>
<p>Songfu</p>
<p>The Position of the Reader</p>
<p>The position of the reader includes three aspects: 1. Reading Room;</p>
<p>2. Card Catalog; 3. Circulation Desk. The most important of these is the last one. Because it is the intermediary between the books in the library and the reader, it is the center of the library. Because the three elements of the library are books,</p>
<p>readers, and librarians – all meet here. In theory, the circulation desk is located in the middle of the book stacks and the reading room. In practice, many are located in this position. The position occupied by the circulation desk should be able to take care of the largest position in front or on both sides, such as the entrance, corridor,</p>
<p>catalog, card catalog, and reading room. At the same time, it should be close to the book stacks for easy retrieval or return of books. There should be ample space in front of and behind the circulation desk. The most important thing is that the circulation desk has sufficient light. It is best to have light from two sides. Because using skylights, it is extremely dark in the early morning.</p>
<p>As for working during the daytime, it is especially inappropriate to use electric lights.</p>
<p>There are also many different kinds of reading rooms, such as general reading rooms, children's reading rooms, reference rooms, magazine rooms, special reading rooms, study rooms, discussion rooms, etc. The various uses are different, and the size, location, and structure are also different. Therefore, it is difficult to generalize. However, in ordinary circumstances, the simpler and more direct the reading room, the better. Avoid circuitous routes. Although theorists often consider circular or octagonal reading rooms unsatisfactory, they are not a major problem if arranged properly. If the architecture is well done, it is also very elegant. For example, Oxford's Radcliffe Library,</p>
<p>London's British Museum, Washington's Congressional Library, and New York's Columbia University Library are all very magnificent.</p>
<p>In the reading room, the most important issue is lighting. If the light comes from one side, then the width of the room cannot exceed 50 to 60% of the height of the window. If the room is 14 or 15 feet high, the window sill can be 4 1/2 or even 5 feet above the ground. Therefore, the surrounding walls have 3 1/2 to 4 1/2 feet of space to place bookshelves, connecting continuously. The higher the window sill, the farther the light reaches. A reading room with about two sides of light should be more than thirty feet wide and fifteen feet high to be suitable. Skylight illumination is not unusable, but it is definitely too dark in the early morning. Reading rooms cannot rely solely on skylight illumination.</p>
<p>Reading rooms, except in special circumstances – such as being limited to reviewing books within the room and not being able to take books from the book stacks – should be close to the book stacks and near the circulation desk, so that the person in charge of the circulation desk can also take care of the readers in the reading room.</p>
<h3>The Position of the Librarian</h3>
<p>The position of the librarian is divided into: 1. Library room and general affairs room, etc.; 2. Cataloging room, card making room, etc.; 3. Registration room, branch library room, etc.; 4. Binding room, printing room, etc.; 5.</p>
<p>Storage room, dining room, retirement room, etc.; 6. Miscellaneous service room, etc. In large libraries, there are also committee rooms, board rooms, etc. It is difficult to set ordinary rules for the layout of each room. However, the most important thing is that the location of each room should be suitable for the tasks being performed. Entry and exit should be convenient, and the lighting should be sufficient. Special attention should be paid to the economy of operations, the convenience of interconnection, and the comfort of the environment.</p>
<h3>Research on Road Construction</h3>
<p>Yun</p>
<p>The title of road construction has already become the key plan for China today. And it is the common effort of the whole country. This is a sign of China's future. However, there are countless ways to manage roads. It cannot be fully explained in one or two words. Now, generally speaking, the elements can be divided into two points. The first is the width of the road. The second is the type of construction. The width of the road surface cannot be fixed. Economic distance and the amount of traffic must be carefully calculated in advance. The so-called width of the highway includes two vehicles (the size must be the same) and refers to the breadth that allows them to travel freely at the same time. This is enough to allow two vehicles to pass safely. When turning, it is not necessary to yield to each other.</p>
<p>The construction of highways is also based on the above principles to determine the type. Local land, local materials, freight costs for materials purchased from other places,</p>
<p>and wages, etc., should all be discussed one by one without negligence.</p>
<p>There are about two types of road construction, called "solid" and "semi-solid" respectively. Solid roads are mostly paved with "three-in-one soil." The cost is very high. Speaking from China's current situation and what is needed by society, semi-solid roads are more suitable. However, the construction method must be distinguished according to the trends of each locality.</p>
<p>The foundation of the road is very important. The distinction between good and bad depends on the materials used and the amount of expense.</p>
<p>The method of establishing the foundation is to use large stones sandwiched with gravel as the bottom layer. And sand is laid on the surface of the road.</p>
<p>However, if this material is lacking, other things can be used instead. As for the size of the object, it depends on the quality of the road and the condition of the land. But in the long run, problems will inevitably arise.</p>
<p>Impermeability to rainwater is also an important point for roads. The method of achieving this depends on the condition of the road surface. The usual procedure is to use asphalt or a mixture containing asphalt and other paving materials mixed and rolled onto the road surface to make it hard and flat.</p>
<p>The method of draining rainwater is also important. And it must be studied. Because the speed of drainage is closely related to the safety and lifespan of the road. The best way is to dig adequate ditches on both sides of the road.</p>
<p>The center of the road should be built with a sufficient arch. This depends on the characteristics of the road surface material. The width of the road determines the height of the arch.</p>
<p>Generally, before a highway is built, it is best to allow traffic to pass first. After a year or six months, pave the final layer of the road surface to allow it to be filled and prepared. The road base can then be stabilized. Maintaining the road surface is also important. If repairs are made at any time according to the traffic situation, the weather, and the condition of the road surface, the cost will not be high, and the road will always be in perfect condition, instead of appearing in a rugged and skewed state.</p>
<p>The load-bearing capacity of the road surface must be limited. Vehicles without automobile tires should not be allowed to pass. As for the maintenance methods, such as oiling and repairing, there is no need to cut off traffic. It can be organized on one side, leaving the other side for vehicles to pass. This is more convenient.</p>
<h3>Further Discussion on Urban Design</h3>

<p>For the past ten years, we Chinese have been talking about new municipal administration, but when we examine what is called municipal administration in China, it is far from the municipal administration of Europe and America, and even further from the so-called ideal municipal administration. There are many reasons for this, roughly speaking, there are the following: first, due to the difficulty of local finances; second, because most of the cities in China are already built, so what is called municipal administration is only to improve existing cities, rather than starting new regulations. From the experience of municipal administration, we can observe that improving cities is always more difficult than creating new cities, so the progress of municipal administration is naturally slow; third, due to the lack of consolidated urban design, whenever a city should be improved or a new city should be created in advance,</p>
<p>there should be a consolidated design, such as the determination of routes, traffic design such as water conservancy, electric lights, drainage ditches, hygiene and public and private buildings, etc., all must have far-sighted and comprehensive calculations in advance, otherwise only taking care of the current piecemeal improvements, then when the population and material resources increase rapidly in ten or twenty years, the original various things will either not be applicable or will not be able to meet the needs of the environment, causing the entire city's municipal administration to fall into a stagnant state. In addition, incidental drawbacks occur, such as the sharp increase in land prices due to the development of municipal administration, speculation rises, causing the poor to suffer even more, and the separation of industrial and commercial and residential areas, with dust and coal gas fumes, hindering public health and so on, all of which are fatal wounds to the entire city. This is due to the lack of an overall plan at the time.</p>
<p>When we talk about municipal administration, we often take Shanghai as a model. Although the buildings in the public and French concessions are roughly scaled, its shortcomings are really too numerous to mention. Let's start with the buildings to prove it. The buildings in the Shanghai concessions are seen by ordinary people as magnificent and beautiful, but those who know better think they are of uneven height and not very beautiful. As for the issue of demarcation, we dare not blindly follow. Looking at the trade area of ​​the Great Roads of England and France in Shanghai, there are residences and factories built at will, without any order, which hinders public health and public safety is really not small. Further, let's talk about trams. Generally, streets that can build tramways must be wide, such as the Fifth Road of the Public Concession and the East New Bridge of the French Concession, where the streets are so narrow that trams actually run through them, so there are often many obstacles in traffic. Moreover, according to the new municipal system of Europe and America,</p>
<p>air lawns should be built in trade areas,</p>
<p>for merchants to rest at will. The Shanghai Public Concession only has a very small number of lawns along the municipal port and the Suzhou River. It is very inconvenient for us. There are many other shortcomings, which I will not elaborate on now. However, from this place, we can see that the municipal administration of the Shanghai concessions is not very good. As for the municipal administration organized by the Chinese, it is even worse than the municipal administration of the concessions. Since Shanghai's municipal weaknesses are so numerous, summarizing them, it is nothing more than that there was no overall urban design for the entire city at the time. After the city developed, it became difficult to change, which caused the city to fall into an incomplete state. Therefore, those who talk about municipal administration in the future should pay attention to the issue of urban planning. Before a city is to be managed, it should have an overall design with a far-sighted vision, and then implement it step by step, so that it can avoid repeating the mistakes of its predecessors. But what is called urban design? Now I will briefly explain it as follows:</p>
<p>Urban design is the science of planning and building cities. Its purpose is to create an urban environment that is convenient for transportation, hygienic for housing, and beautiful in environment. Therefore, from the broad sense of municipal administration, almost every part of the municipal administrative organization has a close relationship with it. Because urban design originally includes the design of docks, wharves, railways, commercial operations, streets, subways, roadways, the planning of internal and external urban transportation, and other things such as water materials, canals, electric lights, public housing, parks, playgrounds, private buildings, public health, etc., all of which belong to the time when urban design is being done, and should be carefully planned, in order to seek the beauty of urban construction, the development of industry and commerce, and the residents' peaceful and prosperous lives, etc., must have a good design.</p>
<p>Moreover, Avinoir, a well-known American urban design research expert, once described the general outline of urban design in his writings, saying that the first purpose of urban design is to protect the health of the citizens and address the housing problem, the water problem, the drainage problem, the public market problem,</p>
<p>and many other hygiene problems, etc., all included. The second purpose is to operate citizens' highly effective labor, such as the issue of transportation agencies, the appropriate configuration and arrangement of commercial districts, industrial districts, and residential areas, all included. The third purpose is to enable citizens to use their leisure time to seek healthy development of body and mind, such as parks, playgrounds, and many other issues, from which we can clearly understand the meaning of urban design.</p>
<p>Ordinary people often think that urban design belongs to engineering problems. It must be known that in the design of a city, engineering problems are only a part, and other things such as hygiene design, financial design, and legal regulations are as important as engineering. From this, it can be known that when a city is designed, not only should engineering personnel be collected, but also medical, legal, and economic talents should be recruited to seek simultaneous development in all aspects.</p>

<h3>Research on Doors and Windows</h3>
<p>Shuang</p>
<p>Although doors and windows are subsidiary parts of houses, they are also very important for people's daily life, because doors and windows can provide natural light and air circulation. Therefore, when we build houses, we should pay special attention to door and window equipment: especially public buildings,</p>
<p>such as hotels, theaters, companies, etc., should have more doors and windows to facilitate access and sufficient light, because this is indirectly related to public health and convenience.</p>
<p>Like the houses in our country in the past, when you stepped inside, you felt dark and damp. The biggest reason was the lack of windows and insufficient light; this affected people's daily life, so this kind of architecture is no longer applicable and has been eliminated in modern times.</p>
<p>Now let's talk about "doors" first.</p>
<p>Western architecture, such as residences, companies, and schools, all use panel doors. Other less important places use frame doors. As for factory buildings, which are originally intended to be sturdy, steel doors are used the most.</p>
<p>Let's talk about "windows" again:</p>
<p>The position of the window directly affects the light, so we must pay attention to the method of its layout. The area occupied by the windows of ordinary school buildings must not be less than 20 to 25 percent of the floor area. There are several things to pay attention to regarding light: (1) The source of light must be continuous; (2) The light must be sufficient and distributed throughout the room; (3) The position of the window should avoid direct sunlight and make it reflected light.</p>
<p>(Window area) The size of the area where light enters must be determined by the depth of the room, the height, and the position of the window. The area of windows in school buildings has already been mentioned above. In factory buildings, according to the current trend, it is best to make both roof skylights and wall windows out of glass; but the area of ordinary windows must be 50 to 60 percent of the floor area.</p>
<p>(Window height) If the windows in the room are only on one side of the wall, in order to make the light sufficient throughout the room, the depth of the room must not exceed three times the height of the window. If there are windows on both sides of the wall, then their height cannot be less than a quarter of the depth of the house.</p>
<p>(Types of windows) There are roughly three types of windows: (1) fixed window frames, (2) movable window frames, (3) pivot window frames.</p>
<p>Movable window frames are also divided into single-sash movable and double-sash movable. The structure is a kind of window frame with pulleys installed inside, one end balanced with weight. Due to the pulling force, the pulley rotates, and the window can move up and down.</p>
<p>The movement of the entire pivot window frame depends on the pivot on one side of the window for rotation, so many buildings use this type.</p>
<p>(Steel windows) The architecture of the new era of the 20th century. No matter what material is used, it is manufactured using scientific methods. Steel windows are one of them. Generally, slightly taller buildings use steel windows instead of wooden windows. Its advantages are: the material is solid, and it is not easily damaged even after being eroded by wind and rain.</p>
<p>And it can also increase the appearance of the building. If a building in a busy area of the city is equipped with steel windows,</p>
<p>the vibrations of vehicles can be avoided.</p>
<p>Therefore, I dare say that steel windows can gain an invincible position in architecture.</p>
