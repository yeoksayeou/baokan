<h3 id="c19">英日美三國海軍競賽（下）實 <a href="#c19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>英國擴張海軍之詳細計劃及預算數字。雖尙未確知。但據倫敦每日電聞報所載。英國海軍部之計劃。擬建造優秀巡洋艦二十九隻。每年建造驅逐艦十五以至十八隻。航空母艦亦加擴充。軍事人員須增加一萬人總而言之英國在今日。必欲保存其世界第一海軍國之特殊地位也。</p>
<p>美國新建艦艇。此次增加預算之後。其變更如何。此刻亦尙無確訊。惟依前此計劃。至少當建造航空母艦二隻。輕巡洋艦四隻。驅逐艦二十隻潛水艇四隻。砲艦二隻。更注力於新航空母艦及巡洋艦所搭載飛機二百九十架之設備。支出經費達九百三十六萬美金。其於擴張海軍中特重航空隊之意已昭然若揭矣。</p>
<p>日本原爲首先發動海軍競爭之人。主張充實軍備。最爲努力。其建造艦艇之内容。計航空母艦二隻。輕巡洋艦二隻。驅逐艦十四隻。潛水艇大小六隻。敷設艦一隻。在倫敦條約限制以外者。尙建造水雷艇四隻。驅潛艇四隻。給油船一隻。潛水母艦一隻。并增加航空隊八隊。</p>
<p>照上述諸點以觀英美日三國鼎立之形勢。其所競爭之主要目標皆集中於海軍。而海軍之中。又以航空母艦爲最重。各國之所以皆積極建造航空母艦。盡力擴充飛機數量。改革飛機質量者。以與歐戰以前之情勢不同也。歐戰以前。海上利器。以無畏式戰鬭艦爲主。其艦行程遠。射擊力强。人稱爲海上活動砲臺。故華盛頓會議以前。日美兩國之海軍競賽。皆持大艦大砲主義。蓋太平洋中戰斱遼闊。無論攻守。均須以大艦大砲。指撣一切。頃者飛機發達平面的戰爭。一變而爲立體的轟炸與毒瓦斯之散布。視往日大砲之於戰鬭艦。已不啻等於一種刀劍。其最大攻擊效能。僅及於五浬十浬而已。至航空母艦速力。旣超越一切。其所搭載之飛機。又可遠達乎千浬之外非但足以探知對方艦隊之形勢。且具充分威脅敵人後方之實力。於是大艦大砲之競爭。雖爲華盛頓倫敦兩條約所限。而各國亦正可不必借重於此。轉其造艦競賽之機輪。以從事於海上航空之競賽。又爲勢所必然者也。</p>
<p>惟今後海上軍備競爭之中心。其將着眼於太平洋乎。大西洋乎。抑爲印度洋乎。太平洋上之爭覇戰。盡人皆知其爲日美兩國之衝突。皆知爲遠東市塲之爭奪。近年來此竽傾向。愈爲積極而顯著。至於大西洋上。英美對立之形勢原不如東方之嚴重。不過戰爭因子之存在。則無可諱言况復法意兩國在地中海又有競爭。而英法之間。亦有若干不恊調之痕跡。其波瀾汹湧於大西洋上。似亦有相當影響。使一般國際形勢愈見複雜。印度洋方面本無人事上之巨大風潮。英美之石油爭奪。未見十分劇烈。决無挑動戰事之可能性。今日所最可注目者。厥爲英日間之關係。日本自高倡大亞細亞主義而後力排英美同時又以工業發達其纎維製品。除欲獨覇中國市塲外。復注目的於印度。然印度實爲英吉利之寳庫。蘭開夏痛感國外市塲窄狹。遂不能不藉英帝國之經濟聯盟。以印度爲棉製品之本據。英日間經濟競爭。旣如是之烈。則將來之影響於軍事。亦未始絕不可能之事。</p>
<p>世界二次大戰之孕育。已成三足鼎立之勢。我國適界乎其間。而又爲彼盟之主要標的。處境之難。自不待言。欲於此世界嚴重之局勢下。謀所以掙扎生存則孰敵孰友。我國人須先自認淸。而後自救之方策。乃可有所着手也。</p>

<p>濟南通信、關於統盤整理冀魯豫黃河計劃、防汎會議已决定委托黃河水利委員會負責主辦、該會擬卽在三省設立臨時工程處、積極施工、該會委員許心武、及工程師王鳳　·陸克銘·昨日抵濟、今日謁見韓主席、商施工辦法、韓對其計畫極爲贊同、許氏對記者談治黃具體計畫甚詳、茲爲紀之如次、</p>

<p>本會對於治黃工作、擬定爲三個步驟、（一）堵塞决口、（二）險工處修壩、（三）修理大堤、工作不甚難、惟經費乃一大問題、行政院已撥五十萬元、作應急工程、但事實上五十萬所差太多、所以防汎會對此鉅大工程、議决撥一千萬元、作治黃工程費、此不過是防汎會之一種要求、能否辦到、尙不可知、余在京臨行時謁汪院長、汪院長允撥五十萬、應付第一步工程、以後再陸續撥發、所以一面堵口、應民衆之要求、一面計畫修壩、將來看中央發多少欵、再作多少事、本會因擔任技術方面、故先計畫起來、除先計畫堵口外、再規畫全河工程、如繼續有欵撥到、卽繼續工程進行、關於此點、本省韓主席、亦係主張先堵口後整個修理、所見相同、沿黃河上下遊險工甚多、如有相當欵項、妥爲修理、可以免除危險、否則年年大汎、均有發生危險之可能</p>
<h3 id="c89">蘭封鄭州最關重要 <a href="#c89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>决口情形、余已在河南看過、（一）蘭封河口係漫决、（二）考城河口係冲决、（三）鄭州北岸）處、現在地方上已堵合一部分、（四）温縣漫决、長度達五十里、關於考城蘭封口門、堵修並非困難、惟東壩工程重要、魯西與蘇北、在在有破害之危險、該處形勢、爲黃河由西來、至蘭封東壩頭折而向北作一大灣曲、再向東流、東壩之西有舊决口、爲老黃河、所築堤名爲新堤、東壩頭之東大堤、舊有缺口未堵、大堤北有圈堤一道、圈堤北有民埝一道、此次决口、係黃水由北南來、先漫民埝、南行二十里復冲破圈堤、由大堤舊缺口處流出、遂淹考城、按常情言、河水漫過民埝又行二十里、已無甚力量、不意今次水力之大如是、殊屬駭人聽聞也、故以情形論、蘭封堵口易、惟爲免除魯西蘇北危險計、東壩　工程、殊爲重　、再則鄭州工程、該處黃河鐵橋橫跨河上、南端在南河岸上、北端係築在老河灘上、據平漢路　總段長説、肇事前、大溜靠南岸、水深三丈餘、詎意在二十四小時以内、大溜移至北岸、南岸竟淤成大灘、離開南岸七里、大溜卽北移、遂决口、由詹店北流、當地百姓當時扒開鐵路、欲以避免被淹、多方勸説、不能阻止、以此處形勢論、决口堵合、亦非甚難、惟北岸開係大爲重要、倘有衝破、河水卽有奪衛河改道人海之可能、華北將遭受空前大水災、以上情形、關係鉅大、是國家問題、而非地方問題也、</p>

<p>蘭封東壩　、平漢路橋、各險工均極重要、應卽整修河壩、屬於河北者計南岸口門一處、北岸七十里内大小口門三十二處、利害均屬於山東、所以堵口工程、以河北爲最吃重、河南次之、此外沿河修壩之處甚多、再則全體修堤、因堤低易漫水、堤薄則易冲决、故必須培高加厚、方保無虞、以上各工程、不過如此計畫、究竟能否辦至、全視中央財力如何云云、</p>

<p>— 琪玲</p>
<p>閲本刋見興之君的談「三」，不禁使在下連想到「五」也有一説的必要。按「三」等「五同爲數目的名詞，字形的構造相差極微，「五」之數較「三」爲大，但「五」在中國我覺得比「三」尤要値得紀念些。</p>
<p>孫總理始創的五權憲法，所用的是個「五」字，據説用五權憲法便可興邦治國，這個「五」字就此不同凡響。外國人譏我同胞缺乏恒心，呌做「五分鐘熱度」，在這裏，我們便覺得這個「五」字不好，是是含侮辱性的。</p>
<p>因了外侮的不住壓迫，便添了不少關於「五」的紀念日，從「五七」，「五九」，「五卅」之後，又權以「五」的紀念日，們都以「五」爲不詳的名詞了。其他關於「五」的紀念日也很多，像「五一」勞慟節，「五四」學生運動皆是。</p>
<p>亞歐美澳非呌做五洲，太平印度大西南冰北冰稱作五洋，黃白黑紅　稱作五種，漢滿蒙回藏稱作五族，泰山華山衡山恒山嵩山呌做五嶽，詩書易禮春秋呌五經，仁義禮智信呌五常，宫商角徵羽呌五音，東西南北中呌五方，墨劓剕宫大辟呌五刑，金木水火土呌五行，肝心脾肺臂呌五内，耳目口鼻舌呌五官，五字的應用太多了，一時也説不盡的。　　近世英美日法意稱作五强，蘇俄有五年計劃，航空奬劵奬額也必是五十萬。　　最近五中全會將要開幕了，我希望執政諸公，早定大計，從此不再四分五裂，人各竭其五分力量，習熟五戎，整厥五兵，敬敷五敎，恪用五權，犧牲五尺，流血五步，與敵人作最後五分鐘的决鬥，方可保我五族，衛我五土，而使我五千年的中華古國，重六於五洲之前，列入五强之間，那末，從此就不會再有什麽五口通商等的辱國喪權的事發生了。</p>

<p>— 錢澐作文楝良作畫</p>
<p>丨他們在暑天丨</p>
<p>在這個一九三三年之夏，不幹些十足時髦的事，有被認有屈死，羊腔，猪　，等的危險；嚼冰，兜風，算得什麽，入冷氣閒，往游泳池，到靑島去，才是顯得了摩登化？冷氣凍得王先生一次牙子作對兒打，當夜服包藥茶，説是「寫意」；游泳，高橋，虹口，更見擠作一團，反正，不會的浸浸皮膚也好；然後再攝那末幾張游泳裝照片，有的迷到在浴盆中也居然游之泳之，管他滿地水漾，却説這里的水絕對没有鹹味，講到靑島，莫干山，普陀避暑，當然又時髦，又闊綽，又舒服的玩意兒，晒黑男的臉，是健，晒黑女的　，是美；但這許處好像專給在上海有錢的人特備享福所在地，也不論這許處是否眞正享福所在地；祗是有一天</p>
<p>偶然在南市某處家鐵店前站了許時：看兩個工人打鐵，透紅的鐵塊，鐵塊，從火穴中鉗出，相互一上一下打，從厚塊打成薄片，從透紅打到灰暗那一霎間的變幻，頗見夠味；可是不用説兩人身上滿是流汗，水滴遮住了　　，他們不能伸第三隻手出來揩拭似的一任延淌，旁邊肩爐子的孩子，火光照耀得臉上，尤其旣紅且黑，他們自己不會，不過我代想到如果他們這時入冷氣間，往游泳池，到靑島去時：豈不喲！不要説，説了得笑歪一般人的嘴。</p>
<p>這一天無有其他感想，想想也感想不完，祗覺天氣已由此特别院凉了不少！</p>
<h3 id="c249">王師母 <a href="#c249" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e249" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">249</a></h3>
<p>— 趙子明</p>
<p>前次我介紹過王師爺，現在我再介紹他的夫人</p>
<p>伊出身是縣官的小姐，當初王師爺，充當幕府時縣官愛他年少英俊，就作爲乘龍快婿。伊非常肥胖，可是三天兩頭的與藥罐做伴，很像「林黛玉」的善病，伊如今霜白兩鬢，還擦上晶光的生髮油，三寸金蓮，套上血紅的綉鞋，眞所謂「人老心不老」！</p>
<p>伊認識「孔乙己」「化三千」，但是統共亦不上二十字左右。</p>
<p>一天，伊做了發財夢，買得一張彩票，很珍貴的收藏起來，待到開奬，才知道買的是去年開過奬的舊票，王師爺是愛錢如命的，所以伊不敢告訴他，這也是「女子無才便是德」的好處！</p>
<p>冬天大雪，路上呢濘，伊出門買醬油，滑倒在雪地上，伊不願路人去扶，由自己慢慢的爬起，因爲「男女是授受不親」！</p>
<p>有時伊抱頭痛哭，指着王師爺哭訴：「我嫁給你一生，没有一天快活，没穿過一件新衣，也没吃過一餐安飯，我的命眞薄！」其實，王師爺，從前也曾紅過。何嘗没有享過快活？我不禁替王師爺呼寃！但，伊嫁王師爺的目的，却僅要好衣好食而已！</p>
<p>伊看到女子剪髮，大不謂然，駡伊們是妖精，旣不像尼姑，又不像和尙！</p>
<p>後來王師爺，患霍亂亡故以後，伊終日伏在屍上痛哭，不久，伊也患霍亂跟隨王師爺於地下，總可算爲「生是並肩人，死爲比目魚了。」</p>
<h3 id="c250">腿話 <a href="#c250" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e250" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">250</a></h3>
<p>— 張羡玲</p>
<p>腿的偶數，簡直完全是雙數，幼學上的商羊是三條腿，封神榜裏的龍鬚虎是一條腿，還有劉海的坐騎是三條腿的蟾，但是這種差數的怪腿，並没有確見的考證，大都目爲齊東野語，所以也不能作爲奇腿。</p>
<p>人類是分有男女和非男非女三種，普通是男女二種，三種人都是二條腿，自從有歷史到現在决不會　見人的腿有一條或三條的，如非受了傷而截掉一條或完全截掉，然而人們的腿在名稱上却各有巧妙：鐵腿，大腿，長腿，美腿，飛毛腿，等等，天下事往往出人意料之外的，在資本主義肆威的現社會正，人們的腿竟做起商業上競爭的廣告了，像各報上的電影廣告，女人　腿，一條條地佔據了影迷的眼兒，不但在商業上是如此，在兩性的問題上也是如此，馬路上所見的女人，當你没有注意到伊的臉龐時，那二條腿却早已進襲了你的眼簾，夏天的女人，甚至裸腿袪褲，這種政策往往使柳下惠心旌搖搖，再也不敢説色即是空了。</p>
<p>聽説美國的電影女明星們，在腿的上面畫了許多人頭，及其他花草之類作爲裝飾，而我們中國的女人祗有裸腿之風，將來也許步美國女明星的後塵，如果腿的使用能夠發展到最高峯，那末在交換借値上也能肆意勃發的，我們對於腿的謎，在將來總能看到的。</p>

<p>第十五回客去含羞柔情蕩微笑人來訪舊惡信啟愁懷</p>
<p>歡愉的空氣，罩滿了這一間屋子，趙自强和楊桂枝羞怯的意味，也都在歡愉之中銷蝕了。黃曼英看了這種樣子，就向桂枝笑道。今天算我們没有白費力，希望你們從今以後，都是自家約會着到這兒來，可别幾十里地把我找了來，無非來吃你們一碗元宵而已。桂枝低了頭，只管笑着吃東西，却没有説什麽。黃曼英正色道：楊，你别害臊，我是和你説正經話。桂枝笑道：我害什麽臊？害臊我還不來呢。田靑伸着手，在趙自强的手臂上，輕輕拍了兩下，笑道。你聽見没有？人家都不害臊，難道你還害臊嗎？趙自强笑道：誰能像你們那個樣子呀。田靑向黃曼英道：你聽見没有？他説不能像你們　個樣子。你們的對方，就是我們了。他也知道説我們了。趙自强道：小田，你越過越會説話了，我可説你不羸。正説到這裏，黃曼英忽然眉頭一皺，口裏連連的喊道：這怎麽辦？這怎麽辦？田靑吃了一驚，站立起來。向他問道：你是怎麽了？曼英一面向雅座外面走，一面向他招招手。田靑只得跟着他走了出去。不多一會，他又三脚兩步的跌了進來，抓了放在桌上的軍帽到手又向外跌了出去。趙自强以爲黃曼英有甚不方便之處，所以走了。田靑呢，自然是跟着伺候他去了。桂枝坐在一邊，心裏也是如此的想着。雖是走了他兩個人，自己坐在這裏，未免有些尶𡯓，然而看着黃�</p>
<p>曼英那個樣子，自己却怎好攔住。所以眼望了人家走去，也就只好手捧了元宵碗，只管低頭喝着湯汁。（一八二）</p>

<p>我和姊姊走到客堂裏來吃飯，席間只有我們兩個人。姊姊告訴我：母親已經半個月没有吃飯了，每天只啜些稀薄的米粥。今天因爲我回來，姊姊特地買了一壺酒，替我洗塵，伊素來不歡喜喝酒的，但今天爲着陪我，也一連喝了幾杯，伊的眉毛梢，淡淡地起了紅暈。伊笑着和我談别後的狀况。我聽着，我喝着酒，可是我没有做聲。</p>
<p>阿花氣喘喘地跑進來。從前我很歡喜宅，我常常帶它到野外去遊玩，到溪裏去洗浴；現在它似乎和我生疏了，它對我瞪了一眼，便轉到姊姊的身邊，先嗅嗅伊的脚，再嗅嗅伊的小腿，然後把兩隻前脚舉起來，搭在伊的膝上，仰着頭望伊，尾巴左右不息地擺動。姊姊伸手撫着它的　項，微笑着指着我問它：</p>
<p>「花！你還認識你的小主人嗎？」</p>
<p>似理解姊姊的話，阿花對我望了一下，便奔到我這邊來，搖頭擺尾，在我的腿間擦來擦去，表示和我親熱。我夾了一塊豆腐給它，它站起來，像個小孩，前脚雙垂着，頭是仰着的，從我的筷間，它把那塊豆腐呑下肚去了。</p>
<p>猛可地母親在房裏急聲的呌我，顯然聲音有些異樣，我忙奔了進去。母親已經坐起來了，伊面前站着一個人，我認得他，是我們工廠裏的賬房，我不知是什麽事，正想上前去問他；忽然他掉轉身來，兇神似的捉住我的手臂，往外就拖，一面嚷着：</p>
<p>「快去！快跟我回去！老　在那裏發脾氣了。他不允許你請假，你怎麽竟這樣大膽，私自地跑回來？」</p>
<p>母親大聲地喊着：「秀兒！我的孩子！不要去！不要去！他來捉你嗎？打死他！」伊從牀上跳下來，拉着我的衣裳；姊姊也抱着我的腰；連阿花也咬着我的褲管。伊們哭着，嚷着，呌着，一齊望裏拉，我被伊們拉倒了。</p>
<p>睜開眼來，我仍然躺在牀上，室内的電燈，對着我冷笑，第一番秋雨的響聲，在窗外爆發，冷汗浸透了我的短衫，我回憶着剛才的夢境，我又快樂，」悲哀，又憤怒。我眞想立刻</p>
<p>丨至遲明天早上丨丨就動身回家去，可是，能够嗎？第一次請假不准，第二次請假，遭了一頓呵斥，誰還敢再去嘗試，并且明天我還要繼續我的掙扎。</p>
<p>「電燈的火熖，灼焦了我的軀殼；窗外的雨聲，滴碎了我的心絃。</p>
<p>我願化爲秋天的暴風雨，</p>
<p>吹灑到故鄉的門前！」</p>
<p>我低吟着。我的涙又　下來了。</p>

<h3 id="c281">關於職業 <a href="#c281" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e281" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">281</a></h3>
<p>— 杜衡</p>
<p>自己因爲照例是没有職業，有職業倒反是極大的例外，這是説，因爲無業可失的緣故，在人生的種種苦痛之中，這失業的苦痛，却是未曾親切地體騐過。牠無形中分散在永遠繼續着跟窮困的掙扎裏；整化爲零，倒也漸漸習慣了，好像這便是人生的本分。然而我却並不因此不對有固定職業的人表示一種羨慕，或甚至嫉妒，並且由此而生出一種憎厭來。這的確是奇怪的心理。</p>
<p>在目前的中國，職業之　固定，最安穩者，也許莫過吃洋飯，即所謂當買辦階級及其下屬那一類東西。對於這一種人的憎厭，正因爲他們底職業是太安穩，太固定，便也更甚於對其他人等。</p>
<p>往往在散公事房的時間，在大馬路外灘那些地方，有好多衣冠楚楚的靑年紳士們，夾着報紙，跳上電車，也不買票，祗漠不關心地説一聲“Ｓｅａｓｏｎ”或僅祗把頭那麽輕輕一搖，表示例外，然後翻開小報來找尋着刺激的標題。每逢看到這種情景，自己也不知道什麽原故會在心裏這樣説：「我希望全世界的人都没有職業·」</p>
<p>自然，我也知道廣大的失業正在打擊着我們的智識階級或半智識階級。一些欲求固定與安穩而不可得的人們正在比長期的無業游民更甚地痛苦着。他們焦急，他們鑽營，他們注意報紙上的分類廣告更甚於注意色情的社會新聞，他們到處漂亮地説着「没有出路，」他們甚至向報紙的編輯先生要求治窮病的「仙方」　　先前，聰明的編輯先生是慣於拿學識，能力，經騐那一套話來搪塞，呌你忍耐，吃得苦中苦，方爲人上人，呌你不要吝惜多多下一些本錢。這個「仙方」究竟是否靈騐，試過的人自然知道，用不到我來多説。近來，情形可又不同，編輯先生們已經發現了應以解决整個社會爲前提的眞理。可是他們的話太漂亮：你不要爲個人謀出路，要爲大衆謀出路。在一個急乎想得到眼前的固定和安穩的靑年，接到這眞理也往往祗有呑下了一個空心湯圓那樣的感覺。</p>
<p>眞有前途的靑年，他受了這樣嚴重的生活的鞭撻，是會比聰明的輯先生更早就參透這眞理的。而那些請「仙方」的朋友們，祗要一旦紅運高照，三十兩五十兩那樣地掙着銀子，一年一加，兩年一升，三十年之後又可以回家養老，而且照樣拿銀子，到那時候，他們必然照樣會擺出一副新式的紳士腔來向我們這些長期的無業游民示威，照樣買Ｓｅａｓｏｎ票，照樣買小報</p>
<p>他們會從此不想到「没有出路」這四個字；因爲在他們看來，社會是因爲自己一有職業而整個地安定了。</p>
<h3 id="c282">從「爲翻譯辯護」談到樓譯「二十世紀之歐洲文學」 <a href="#c282" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e282" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">282</a></h3>
<p>— 穆木天</p>
<p>洛文先生，在「爲翻譯辯護」中，説了如下的幾句話：</p>
<p>「翻譯的不行，大部分的責任固然在該翻譯家，但讀書界和出版界，尤其是批評家，也應分負若干的責任。要救治這頽運，必須有正確的批評，指出壞的，奬勵好的」</p>
<p>爲編譯的關係，偶然把樓建南先生譯的「二十世紀的歐洲文學」（新生命出版）同日譯本對了一番。誤譯之處，自然很多。因爲偶而一翻，即馬上發現了如下的幾個珍奇的現象。</p>
<p>在十四頁「馬克森杜卡恩」之下註有：（Ｍａｘｉｍ　ｄｕ　Ｋａｈｎ）」。我很奇怪，因在各處查來查去，但終没查出這位人物來。法國有一個Ｍａｘｉｍ　ｄｕ　Ｃａｍｐ，是福羅貝爾的朋友。又有一個詩人呌ＧｕｓｔａｖｅＫａｈｎ，是猶太人。「Ｍａｘｉｍ　ｄｕ　Ｋａｈｎ）」我不知究竟爲何許人。恐怕樓先生所附的原名，是杜撰的罷。</p>
<p>在一百九十九頁，有一在這種小説之中，最近由學術院（譯者：當係指著者所屬的俄國共產主義學院）所選的魯易倍爾德蘭的不朽的諸作，爲最優秀。」在我以爲此地所謂“Ａｃａｄｅｍｉｅ”者，當指法國翰林院。蘇聯雖稱學藝發達之邦，但不會爲帝國主義作家作選集罷？我不知爲什麽樓先生那樣地濫下註解？</p>
<p>在二二三頁，有「在二十世紀的初期，法朗士蹈出了他的歷史的新時代，大規模的（冶金的）工業成長了：金融資本的勢力强化了；帝國主義的意德沃洛幾濃厚了」我初見之下。頗覺費解。「法朗士蹈出了他的歷史的新時代，」是怎麽回事呢？我不禁翻了日譯一下。原來不是法朗士，而是法蘭西。我眞不知這樓先生竟疏忽如是，把原文前後文看都未看淸楚，就譯了出來，這點，是太不負責了。</p>
<p>在二四○頁中，有「不燃的林叢」一書名。一看我也學得奇怪。因爲我不曉得，了從未聽説過維曼，羅蘭曾作過那一本書。仔細一看，那原是「約翰·克立斯朶夫」（Ｊｏａｎ　Ｃｈｒｉｓｔｏｐｈｅ）第九卷。牠的法文原名是ＬｅＢｕｉｓｓｏｎ　Ａｒｄｅｎｔ“Ａｒｄｅｎｔ”是「灼燒的」「如燒着一般的」的意義。到那裏去，我都找不出「不燃燒」的不字來？我以爲日文譯錯了，我查一查日文，原來是「燃工又叢」「又」是表示「過去」的意思的助動詞。並不是表示否定打消的助動詞。這一點文法，不知爲什麽樓先生都不懂？</p>
<p>在二八八頁有一句「最后地民衆地委任於决定的言詞」。這句又令我不明白了，找出日譯原文一看，原來是「最後把决定之言詞委之於民衆」的意思。</p>
<p>在二四一頁中有一句「似新非新的智識階級」。所謂「似新非新的」是什麽東西呢？我懷疑。查日譯本一看却是「新的完全不同了的智識階級」之意羲。</p>
<p>在二八四頁有：「我並要加緊它」，而願文意思是説：「我追加一句説」。這句話的日文是非常粗淺的，不知爲什麽樓先生竟弄得大錯而特錯了？</p>
<p>在二八四頁中有：「我們的勝利是和西撒之破壞空想着以某一國爲奴以彼一國爲奴的皇太子之壺灶相同的。」這怎麽講呢？我查了日文。隨後我再查了巴比塞的法文原文。法文同日文是不大相同的。按照日文可以謂爲「我們的勝利是同破壞　凱撒的丨丨空想着使這一國民爲奴隸使那一國民作奴隸的皇太子的丨丨老巢一樣。」不知爲什麽樓先生竟譯得那麽怪？這不但不「信」而且不「順」不「通」丨丨到底是什麽原故呢？</p>
<p>以上是偶而繙閲時掛一漏萬所巡禮到的幾個珍怪的錯誤。除末尾二八四頁中的錯誤或者情有可原，（因爲日文或者難些）其他均是不應錯的。只要學過一年二年日文的話　决不會錯的。可是樓先生居然弄錯了！</p>
<p>因讀了洛文先生的文章，微感責任，丨雖然我不是批評家丨所以把隨便一翻得來的珍奇現象報告出來。我想這對於譯者和讀者都是有益處的。</p>
<p>爲　中國之翻譯界有好的前途起見，我以爲誰都應當作這種檢查批評的工作。但是要出以冷靜的，誠懇的，友誼的態度，而不宜攻擊笑駡。</p>
<h3 id="c283">馬致遠雜劇 <a href="#c283" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e283" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">283</a></h3>
<p>— 鄭振鐸</p>
<p>前幾天趙景深先生在自由談上論及馬致遠雜劇；文中有兩點錯誤，値得一説　　第一點，趙先生舉出馬氏小令四首，以爲係馬氏「孟浩然踏雪尋梅」等四劇的胚胎。這是不大可信的論斷。誰知道馬氏那幾首小令是作在雜劇之前的呢，還是作在其後的？小令裏發揮曠達的厭世觀，是一般元曲家共同具有的思想；怎麽能强指馬氏先有此種小令所具有的胚胎，然後才發展而成爲雜劇呢？果是此説，則元人小令中，咏陳搏，咏孟浩然等等者也不在少數，難道又是馬氏雜劇的胚胎？元明人小令，歌詠崔，張故事者最多（雍熙樂府有小桃紅百首，詠西廂事；成化間所刋賽駐雲飛小曲，亦有詠西廂事者多篇。）難道他們也都是王實甫西廂記的胚胎麽？我以爲研侒一個作家的作品，除明白的知道其作品產生的確實年月者外，便很難决定某篇是某作的胚胎，或某作是由某文某詩發展而成的；更不能因爲小令簡短，便硬指他們必爲雜劇的胚胎。我們只能説，馬氏這些小令在思想上和他的雜劇是同樣的丨丨當然出於同一位作家这手下的東西，思想自不會相差得很遠的。</p>
<p>第二點，趙先生無條件的相信了王國維曲錄的記載，以爲孟浩然踏雪尋梅一劇是馬致遠所作。其實馬氏壓根兒便不曾寫過此劇。我們在錄鬼簿太和正音譜諸最古的記載上，都找不到馬氏劇目裏有所謂踏雪尋梅的一劇。强派此劇爲馬氏作者，始於明人息機子的古今雜劇選。王國維根據了息機子之説，便也將此劇加入馬氏劇作之列。説來可笑，息機子所錄的踏雪尋梅劇原來便是周憲王（朱有　）所作的那一本。憲王此劇，作於宣德七年，有自序，説明其作此劇的意旨甚詳，當然不會是鈔襲或改作馬氏的。（息機子雜劇選，北平圖書館藏；周憲王踏雪尋梅，見商務版奢摩他室曲叢）爲什麽息機子硬把這張冠改戴在那李頭上，我們不能知道；難道他也熟讀馬氏小令，覺得有些小令乃是此劇的胚胎麽？明人如此僞造作者姓名的事，是司空見慣的，於散曲及劇曲尤甚。（吳歈萃雅等坊本，最荒唐，作者姓名錯誤極多。）我們必須仔細剖析，一不小心便會上他們的大當。五國維曲錄的許多錯誤，便往往都因此而得之。就今日所已有的正確的知識，去糾正王氏及諸明人的錯誤而别編一部中國戲曲總目，（大東版曲海總目提要錯誤尤多）當不會是什麽無聊的工作罷。</p>

<p>— 沈從文</p>
<p>「我快樂得很。我感謝你。」</p>
<p>就在那兩句話上，玩味了許久，也就正是把自己陷入過去一切日子襄。</p>
<p>過了一會，女人説：</p>
<p>「我也快樂得很」。</p>
<p>「我覺得你年靑了許多，比我在山東那個海邊見你時還年靑。」「當眞嗎？」</p>
<p>「你看我的眼睛，你看看，你就明白你的美麗處，如何反映在一個男子驚訝上！」「但你過去并不丨從不爲什麽美麗所驚訝，也不爲什麽温柔所屈服。」</p>
<p>「我這樣説過嗎？」</p>
<p>「雖不這樣説過，却有這樣事實。」</p>
<p>他傍近了她，把另一隻手輕輕的搭上她的肩部，且把頭靠近她鬢邊去。</p>
<p>「我想起我自己胡塗處，十分羞慚。」</p>
<p>她把臉掉過去，遮飾到自己的悲哀，却輕輕的説道：</p>
<p>「看，下面的村子多美！」</p>
<p>男子同一個小孩子一樣，走過她面前去，搜索她的臉，她便把頭低下去，不再説話。他想擁她，她却向前跑了。前面便是那個不知姓氏的墳園短牆，她站在那里不動，他趕上前去把她兩隻手皆揑得緊緊的，臉對着臉，兩人皆無話可説。兩人皆似乎觸着一樣東西，暗啞了，不能用口再説什麽了。</p>
<p>女的把一隻白白的手摩着男的臉頰，同胳膊，「冷不冷？夜了，我們回去。」男的不説什麽，只把那隻手拖過嘴邊吻着。</p>
<p>兩人默默的走回去。</p>
<p>到旅館後，男的似乎還很興奮，躺在一張靠椅上去，女的則站在他的身邊，帶着親切的神氣，把手去撫男子的額部，且輕輕的問他：</p>
<p>「累不累？頭昏不昏？」</p>
<p>男的便仰起頭顱，看到女人的白臉。作第五十次帶着又固執又孩氣的模樣説：　　「我愛你。」</p>

<p>(Nanchang) The Lushan Conference, with Song Ziwen as the center, discussed issues such as cotton and wheat technical cooperation, construction procedures, economic control, Yellow River management and disaster relief, post-war arrangements in North China, army reorganization, northwest development, and national defense construction.

He intends to adopt the customs and postal methods to provide strict protection for the positions and salaries of the personnel, and to standardize promotions and demotions based on ability and seniority, so that political personnel will be transferred, while technical and administrative personnel will remain unaffected.

<p>Hebei Provincial Government Increases Security Force</p>
<p>Severe Banditry in War Zone Makes Disaster Relief Difficult</p>
<p>Yu Xuezhong Arrived in Beiping Last Night</p>
<p>(Beiping) Tao Shangming said that there are still no proper or concrete measures for the Yuguan takeover and the dispatch of our troops to suppress bandits in eastern Hebei. Someone has been sent from here to Changchun to contact General Hishikari, commander of the Japanese Kwantung Army. The issue of returning the various passes of the Great Wall is also being handled by someone in Changchun, and the negotiations are being carried out in conjunction with the case. The bandit atmosphere in eastern Hebei is very serious, and the people are suffering. It is hoped that the government will take measures to suppress them as soon as possible. Liu Shisun went to Tianjin a few days ago and will go to Huiguan in a day or two. The bandit atmosphere in eastern Hebei is very serious, and the people are suffering. It is hoped that the government will find a way to suppress them as soon as possible. (8th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Tao Shangming went to Tianjin to meet Yu Xuezhong and reported everything. He returned to Beiping this morning. After getting off the train, he immediately visited Yin Tong and should have gone to Jurentang with He Zhao at noon to discuss everything. Regarding the bandit suppression problem in eastern Hebei, our side has decided to send armed police to handle it. A decision will be made after Yu comes to Beiping to visit He. Disaster relief in the war zone is difficult because of the severe banditry in various counties. All personnel sent to various counties have not reported back in recent days. The war zone relief association has previously telegraphed various provincial governments to request relief. The Shandong provincial government has remitted 10,000 yuan. Other provinces and cities have replied that they will find ways to remit funds. The association has telegraphed the Executive Yuan to expedite the approval of the public bond regulations in order to facilitate the issuance of disaster relief because of the importance of disaster relief at present. (8th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) It has been decided to first send troops to suppress bandits in eastern Hebei. As for the permanent security of the various counties, the security forces will be increased and sent to garrison. The quota of the security forces was originally set at 9,000 people. Currently, there are only more than 2,000 people in the war zone, which is not enough to allocate. The provincial government has begun to gradually increase the number until the original quota is met. The Shi Yousan troops stationed in Yutian County have also been reorganized into security forces and will be dispatched to various places for garrison. (8th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Yu Xuezhong will come to Beiping tonight to visit He Yingqin and discuss matters. (8th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Yu Xuezhong arrived in Beiping tonight and said that he had gone to Lushan a few days ago to meet with Jiang and Wang to report on the political situation in Hebei. This time, he came to report to He on his visit to Lushan and was not consulting on bandit suppression matters in the war zone. There are not as many bandits in the war zone as rumored outside, approximately only two to three thousand people. The method of suppression has not yet been decided. According to Liu Shisun, the foreign rumors of the Japanese side refusing our side to send troops into the war zone to suppress bandits, according to Liu Shisun, the result of negotiations with the Japanese side is that Japan has agreed. There should be no problem in recovering the various passes of the Great Wall, which still needs to be negotiated with the Japanese side. Disaster relief in this area will proceed according to the previously decided method of emergency relief. Because the central government is also paying attention to the Yellow River water disaster, there are no concrete measures yet. The date of issuance of war zone treasury bonds has not been determined. Huang Fu will return to Beiping in a week or two. He Jingwu is the mayor of Changjin, I have not heard of that. Hebei's finances are difficult, and if there is a shortfall, the central government can provide appropriate assistance. (8th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Yu Xuezhong arrived here from Tianjin tonight. It is said that the authorities are still negotiating with the Japanese personnel on the matter of dispatching government troops to eastern Hebei to suppress bandits. The Japanese personnel have agreed with this proposal, but detailed methods still need to be discussed and decided. Yu also said that there are not as many bandits in eastern Hebei as rumored, and it should not be difficult to quell them. (8th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<p>Ambushed by Zhang Lingyun's Troops</p>
<p>Zhao Chengshou's Cavalry Arrives at Fengzhen to Assist in the Suppression</p>
<p>(Beiping) A telegram from Zhangbei states that Liu Guitang telegraphed Song on the 7th to report that Fang will send representatives to Zhangbei. The temporary commander of the first detachment, Huang Shouchong, arrived in Zhangbei yesterday to visit Song and returned to Dushikou this morning. At 9:00 AM this morning, Song, accompanied by the guard regiment commander, Wu Ziliang, took five cars to inspect the second platform in Yanhou again to supervise Zhao Dengyu, Nie Yuling, and Zhang Lingyun's troops to resolve Ji's matter. Song will return to Zhangjiakou and then to Beiping to report to He after the matter is concluded. Ji attempted to flee to Dushikou and was surrounded by Zhang Lingyun's troops. On the 6th, they retreated towards Damiaozi. There are still over a thousand remnants. (8th Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) In the afternoon of the 8th, after the regular meeting of the Legislative Yuan, a secret meeting was held to continue. Sun Ke reported on his attendance at the Lushan Conference: 1. The government has decided to implement economic control, expand the scope of the National Economic Council, manage national economic and financial affairs, and control all state-owned enterprises. All railways, postal services, shipping administration, telecommunications, and various income-generating businesses will be placed under its management. The Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Railways, and Ministry of Communications will narrow their scope and manage administrative affairs. 2. The use of US cotton and wheat loans has been determined to be for production projects. A management committee will be established to be responsible for the allocation. The committee is subordinate to the National Economic Council to comply with the power of control. 3. Other matters concerning internal affairs and foreign affairs were also discussed at the Lushan Conference, and response strategies have been slightly shifted. (8th Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e15">Sun Ke's Remarks Upon Arriving in Nanjing <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>Diplomatic Strategies Should Be Based on Adapting to the Environment</p>
<p>Cotton and Wheat Loans Used for Production Projects</p>
<p>The Fifth National Congress May Be Postponed</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Sun Ke arrived in Nanjing on the Dehe ship at noon on the 8th and attended a meeting of the Legislative Yuan in the afternoon. After the meeting, he said that Song's visit to Lushan this time made it clear that European and American countries have a clear understanding of China's environment. Although public opinion expresses sympathy for us, in essence, they are all based on their own positions and cannot provide substantial assistance. They still hope that China will come up with concrete measures to save itself. Regarding the League of Nations' many resolutions on the Sino-Japanese incident in the past, there are no effective measures to sanction Japan in practice. The League of Nations is an international group and has no real strength of its own. We should not have excessive expectations of the League of Nations, nor should we be disappointed because of it. Only by seeking self-help can we prolong the national destiny. As for our country's foreign policy, it has never changed. The highest principle for determining foreign policy should be the survival of the nation. We should be friendly with those who can help our national survival, and hostile to those who want to infringe on our national survival. This is our country's traditional foreign policy and can also be said to be the common foreign policy of all countries in the world. However, diplomatic strategies should be based on adapting to the international situation and the domestic environment, so the methods can be changed at any time and place. Furthermore, if Japan threatens us for its own benefit, we should act according to our ability. Actual confrontation cannot be achieved by empty slogans, which will not help the facts. As for the use of cotton and wheat, the Lushan Conference also studied it and focused on production. When Song borrowed US wheat in the US, the Central Political Conference had already decided on the principle of allocating the loans. This decision was made at the Lushan Conference and will still follow the original plan to use the cotton and wheat loans entirely for production projects. No matter how difficult military and political expenses are, they must not be misappropriated on any pretext. In the future, the allocation of cotton and wheat funds will be managed by the central responsible agency. The National Economic Council plans to be reorganized in the near future to make its capabilities more substantial, to be able to take responsibility for suggestions, and to cooperate technically with the League of Nations. It has also been decided that representatives from various agencies and civil organizations will be recommended to participate in the organization to supervise whether the use of funds is for production projects in order to express the government's intentions. Sun continued that the Lushan Conference had an open and honest study of the southwest issue. It was recognized that the southwest authorities advocated postponing the Fifth National Congress. The central government, with a broad mind, may consider or may adopt it, but it must be decided by the central government and cannot be finalized by the claims of three or two military personnel. Therefore, whether the Fifth National Congress will be suspended or postponed is still under detailed discussion by the central government before a decision is made. The opinions of the three authorities in the southwest can only be used as a reference. Whether or not Commissioner Feng enters Beijing will be discussed by Jiang and Wang, and I did not participate. The draft constitution will continue to be discussed and will not be put on hold because of whether the Fifth National Congress is postponed. Whether the National Senate needs to be convened will depend on the central government. (8th Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e19">Naval Competition Between Britain, Japan, and the United States (Part Two) <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>Detailed plans and budget figures for Britain's naval expansion are not yet known for certain. However, according to the London Daily Telegraph, the British Admiralty plans to build twenty-nine excellent cruisers, fifteen to eighteen destroyers each year, and expand aircraft carriers. The number of military personnel must be increased by 10,000. In short, Britain today must maintain its special status as the world's leading naval power.</p>
<p>After the increased budget this time, it is not yet certain how the United States' new ships will change. However, according to previous plans, at least two aircraft carriers, four light cruisers, twenty destroyers, four submarines, and two gunboats should be built. More attention should be paid to the equipment of 290 aircraft carried on the new aircraft carriers and cruisers, with expenditures reaching 9.36 million US dollars. The intention of attaching special importance to the air force in the expansion of the navy has been clearly revealed.</p>
<p>Japan was originally the first to launch the naval competition, advocating the strengthening of military preparations and striving the most. The content of its ship construction includes two aircraft carriers, two light cruisers, fourteen destroyers, six submarines of various sizes, and one minelayer. Outside the restrictions of the London Treaty, four torpedo boats, four submarine chasers, one oiler, and one submarine tender are also being built, and eight air force squadrons are being added.</p>
<p>Looking at the tripod situation of Britain, the United States, and Japan in light of the above points, the main goals of their competition are concentrated on the navy. Among the navy, aircraft carriers are the most important. The reason why all countries are actively building aircraft carriers, doing their best to expand the number of aircraft, and reforming the quality of aircraft is different from the situation before the European War. Before the European War, the main maritime weapon was the Dreadnought battleship. The ship had a long range and strong firepower, and it was called a mobile artillery platform at sea. Therefore, before the Washington Conference, the naval competition between Japan and the United States was based on the principle of large ships and large cannons. The battlefield in the Pacific Ocean is vast, and both offense and defense must be directed by large ships and large cannons. Recently, the development of aircraft has changed the flat war into three-dimensional bombing and the spread of poison gas. The cannons of the past are no different from swords for battleships. Their maximum attack effectiveness is only five or ten nautical miles. The speed of aircraft carriers has surpassed everything. The aircraft they carry can reach thousands of nautical miles away. Not only is it enough to detect the enemy's fleet formation, but it also has the power to fully threaten the enemy's rear. Although the competition for large ships and large cannons is limited by the Washington and London treaties, countries can just not rely on this and turn their ship-building competition gears to engage in maritime aviation competitions, which is also an inevitable trend.</p>
<p>However, the future center of maritime arms competition will focus on the Pacific Ocean, the Atlantic Ocean, or the Indian Ocean? Everyone knows that the struggle for hegemony in the Pacific Ocean is a conflict between Japan and the United States. Everyone knows that it is a struggle for the Far East market. In recent years, this trend has become more active and significant. As for the Atlantic Ocean, the situation of British-American confrontation is not as serious as in the East. However, the existence of war factors is undeniable. Moreover, France and Italy have competition in the Mediterranean, and there are also some uncoordinated traces between Britain and France. Its stormy waves on the Atlantic Ocean also seem to have a considerable impact, making the general international situation more complicated. There is no major human turmoil in the Indian Ocean. The oil struggle between Britain and the United States is not very fierce. There is no possibility of provoking a war. Today, what is most noteworthy is the relationship between Britain and Japan. Since Japan highly advocated Pan-Asianism, it has been rejecting Britain and the United States, and at the same time, it has developed its industry, and its fiber products, in addition to wanting to dominate the Chinese market, are also focusing on India. However, India is actually Britain's treasure trove. Lancashire feels deeply that the foreign market is narrow, so it cannot but rely on the economic alliance of the British Empire to make India the base of cotton products. The economic competition between Britain and Japan is so fierce, so its future impact on military affairs is not impossible.</p>
<p>The gestation of the Second World War has formed a tripod situation. Our country is located in between and is the main target of their alliance. The difficulty of the situation is self-evident. If we want to struggle for survival in this serious world situation, who are our enemies and who are our friends? We Chinese must first recognize ourselves clearly, and then a strategy for self-salvation can be started.</p>

<h3 id="e20">American Warships Set Sail, Reaching 30 Vessels; 12 Aircraft Ordered to Standby <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>Rumor: Washington Plans to Force Cespedes' Reinstatement</p>
<p>Cuban Party Leaders Discuss Forming New Government</p>
<p>Havana: The new Cuban government declared that if the people wish, the new government would resign in accordance with public opinion. It is reported that the Central Committee of the Communist Party has agreed that if American troops land, they will open fire immediately to show the world that Cuba is not an American colony. Twenty-five American warships have already sailed to Cuba or are en route. There are widespread rumors that the American government plans to ask the Cuban revolutionary government to hand over power to Dr. Cespedes and form a coalition government. It is reported that army officers have vastly differing opinions on whether this violent political maneuver is well-considered. Some are advocating recalling the dismissed officers and reinstating the Cespedes government. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<p>(New York) Cuban troops have arrived in Havana to suppress communists. Today, the Communist Party issued a declaration with slogans such as "Down with the government! Long live the Soviet of Workers and Peasants! Soldiers and sailors, rise up to resist American imperialism!" American warships are rushing to the Cuban capital to protect American lives and property. Meanwhile, leaders of various parties, except for students, have joined the Provisional Revolutionary Committee to study national issues. They are now planning to form a new government with a Revolutionary Administrative Council attached. The American Marines have rushed to build a radio station so that the American ambassador in Cuba can communicate with American warships. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<p>Havana: Representatives of various Cuban parties met in the presidential palace today to discuss with the Executive Committee the issue of forming a government led by Cespedes. When Army Leader Sergeant Batista arrived at the presidential palace, he was escorted by several cars full of soldiers. During the discussion, a large contingent of soldiers guarded the palace grounds. Acting President Cespedes remained quietly at home, awaiting the results of the meeting. (Havas, 7th)</p>
<p>Havana: According to reliable sources, the American side believes that because Acting President Cespedes has been recognized by various countries, the Cuban government must be headed by Cespedes for the United States to recognize it as legitimate. Currently, American warships are arriving one after another, and there is a possibility of American intervention. Therefore, the Cuban provisional government has no choice but to change its approach and prepare to acknowledge a compromise. The so-called compromise is to maintain Cuban independence, with the United States not interfering, and the Cespedes government personnel not taking advantage of the situation for their own political gain.

<p>(Washington) Eight more American destroyers have been ordered to Cuba. Together with the ships previously dispatched, the American naval force concentrated in Cuban territorial waters has reached thirty vessels. (Havas, 7th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Eight American coastal destroyers have been ordered to Cuba to join the ships previously sent. These destroyers have a speed of 30 to 33 knots and each carries 88 sailors and 7 officers. (Havas, 7th)</p>
<p>Havana: Two American destroyers have sailed to Cuba from Newport. The destroyer Woolverton has been ordered to Isla de Pinos because of fears that the 2,000 prisoners in the model prison on that island will riot. Troops in Havana have set up machine guns at various points and have been ordered to open fire if there is any disturbance. Demonstrations in the streets have been banned, and the State Department has been heavily guarded. (Reuters, 7th)</p>

Although their destination has not been announced, it is believed that they will first go to Key West or Pensacola in Florida. If the situation in Havana suddenly changes, they can fly to Cuba immediately. (Guomin, 7th)</p>

<p>(New York) The New York Evening Post fiercely criticized President Roosevelt's attitude towards the Cuban coup, stating:</p>
<p>"On the one hand, the government has declared that the United States does not wish to intervene unless absolutely necessary, while on the other hand, the American naval authorities are conspicuously concentrating the navy in Cuban territorial waters, numbering as many as two fleets. At the same time, it is also declared that troops will be transported to Cuba by air. This action is not only unwise but also an ominous policy." The newspaper believes that Secretary of the Navy Swanson is the most unsuitable person to send to Cuba, and also stated, "President Roosevelt's political talents are generally recognized, but the American government seems to inevitably change with the wind, with an uncertain direction. The sailing of the armored cruiser Maine to Havana in 1898 was the result of an unconsidered, sudden action, just as President Wilson's sending ships to Veracruz, Mexico in 1916 was nothing more than a momentary impulse. This kind of action seems to accomplish something, but in reality, it is meaningless, only causing Wilson himself and the American people to deeply regret it. Today's events are exactly the same."

<p>Havana: While Communist speakers were loudly denouncing the United States, the chairman of the Revolutionary Committee, Grau, also met with reporters at the presidential palace, saying that the American president's actions failed to conform to his proclaimed Good Neighbor Policy. His (referring to Grau) work of organizing a provisional government was hindered by the arrival of American warships. The Revolutionary Committee is now the target of pressure from the American Embassy. He also said, "What we want is to give Cuba a good opportunity for self-development, to give its people truly fair treatment. We want to give the Cuban people the opportunity to express their own opinions, to adopt a truly Cuban constitution, not one dictated by the American Embassy. We overthrew Machado because he was tyrannical and dictatorial, and we overthrew President Cespedes because he was merely a puppet." Grau further explained that the type of government to be adopted in the future should be decided by the people. The revolutionaries have no intention of abandoning national debts. If there is a loyal government, Cuba can certainly repay its debts. This is what the Revolutionary Committee is willing to guarantee. Cuba is actually more stable today than it has been in the past eight years. Only the arrival of American warships has prevented the people from being calm. The dispatch of ships is neither a friendly act nor what a neighboring country should do, and it fails to conform to the American president's proclaimed Good Neighbor Policy." (Guomin, 7th)</p>
<h3 id="e25">Communist Party Active, Anti-American Sentiment Strong <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>Havana: For the first time in Cuban history, the Communist Party is allowed to operate freely. Communists held a meeting in the central park here, denouncing the United States as "Yankee imperialists" plotting to annex Cuba and make Cuban workers forever industrial slaves. Police surrounded the podium for protection, and order was maintained at the meeting. (Guomin, 7th)</p>
<p>Havana: The new Cuban revolution has shown an anti-American trend today. Radical students and workers wanted to stage a demonstration against the American manager of the United Fruit Company here, Moran. A parade was organized, but the authorities dispatched troops to disperse it and guarded the wharf to escort Moran onto a ship back to the United States. Furthermore, the radical color of the new government is becoming increasingly strong. In the provinces, several sugar mills have been occupied by rioters, and strikes and coercion to recognize workers' demands have become increasingly common. At present, the activities in the capital and the provinces are uncoordinated, and atrocities are increasing daily. In order to please the United States, the government ordered the reinstatement of retired army and navy officers who had not flattered Machado, but many hesitated to comply. (Guomin, 7th)</p>

It was also heard that the student teams have received machine guns in preparation for implementing their decision. Therefore, although the situation in Havana is still peaceful, Americans are quite anxious about the rise of the Communist Party or other radical elements. (Guomin, 7th)</p>

Furthermore, Britain is negotiating trade agreements with other countries this year, so the government feels that any suggestions made by the Import Duties Advisory Committee should also be temporarily decided upon. Sir May replied that he was willing to accept the government's proposal to temporarily not consider the silk tax. (Reuters, 7th)</p>

<p>Deeply Attentive to Our Country's Future Diplomatic Strategies</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The years 1935 and 1936 mark the effective date of Japan's withdrawal from the League of Nations and the expiration of the naval treaty. Japan will encounter a crisis in its foreign relations. England, the United States, China, Russia, and other countries are watching for this opportunity and are burying themselves in working against Japan. In particular, the United States and China have common interests in various areas. Cooperation between the two countries has recently become increasingly close. Japan has been paying close attention to this. Recently, American power has significantly expanded in Central and South China, especially in aviation and communications agencies, fostering rights and interests. As a result, it is eagerly fostering political and economic power from the Yangtze River to cities in South China such as Zhejiang, Fujian, and Guangdong. On the other hand, the National Government will re-determine its policy towards Japan at the Lushan Conference after Song Ziwen returns home. These facts all affect Japan's future security.

<p>(Tokyo) A joint meeting of the three ministries of the Army, Navy, and Foreign Affairs was held yesterday to address the Washington Naval Disarmament Conference in 1935 and the general disarmament conference reopening in October this autumn. At the first meeting of the council, all agreed that the beliefs of the Empire regarding the political situation in the Far East and the inevitability of the Empire's national defense plan must be promoted to the proper understanding of officials and people of various countries. As a preliminary strategy for the disarmament conference, the three ministries should unanimously carry out proper propaganda work. Therefore, the three authorities should, whenever the opportunity arises, implement thorough, appropriate, and effective strategies based on the following main points: (1) The Japanese naval plan is to strengthen national defense and has no plan to attack. The current plan does not exceed the limits of the existing naval treaty. (2) Japan has no aggressive intentions towards the United States and other friendly countries and is extremely concerned about maintaining international peace. The Japanese naval plan does not violate this spirit. (3) The independence of "Manchukuo" and Japan's recognition of it are the only effective measures to establish peace in the Far East. It is hoped that England, the United States, and other powers will understand Japan's beliefs, and at the same time, it is hoped that China will awaken and agree with Japan's beliefs. (4) Equal opportunities and open doors in "Manchukuo" are the policies of "Manchukuo," and Japan supports them. (Dentsu, 8th)</p>

<p>Bai Lushi, Johnston, and Haleifu, the British crew members of the "Nanchang" ship, who were abducted in Niuzhuang on March 29th of this year, were trapped in the bandit's den for more than five months. They have now been released and arrived in Panshan at 9 PM last night under the escort of Captain Obata of the Niuzhuang Japanese Military Police.

Major Obata of the Manchurian state spent considerable effort to rescue the British crew members.</p>
<p>The bandits initially demanded a ransom of one million Japanese yen.

Subsequently, the bandits realized the futility of prolonging the situation and surrendered to both Japan and Manchuria, releasing the hostages. After receiving the hostages, Major Obata handed them over to the British Consul in Yingkou on the 8th. This effort was based on humanitarian grounds and to maintain the security of the Manchurian state. (Dentsu dispatch, 8th)</p>

There, the Japanese authorities at the Japanese Military Police Headquarters formally handed the three men over to Clark, the British Vice-Consul in Shenyang. The three then took a bath, changed clothes, and groomed themselves, quickly regaining their normal appearance. According to Johnston, the oldest of the three, they were treated kindly in the bandits' den and were not subjected to any mistreatment.</p>
<p>The bandits hid them in sorghum fields during the day, while the bandits themselves passed the time gambling. However, they changed locations every night, it was said. All three stated that they planned to return to England as soon as possible. Johnston's five-year contract had three months remaining, while Bai Lushi had only two months left. Haggrieve, however, had two years remaining. According to the Taikoo Company's manager in Niuzhuang, speaking to a Reuters reporter, the three are temporarily staying at his residence and will travel to Shanghai within a day or two. Clark arrived here on March 29th to handle the rescue efforts and is scheduled to return to his post in Shenyang tonight. The final negotiations were completed yesterday afternoon. After receiving the ransom, the bandits released the three at 3 PM in a sorghum field about ten miles from Panshan. Japanese officials, led by Obata, first sent people to the bandits to check on the well-being of the three men. After receiving confirmation that they were safe, the ransom was sent.

<p>(Nanjing) The Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission has repeatedly denied that Xikang is in a state of emergency, but in reality, the Tibetan side has already issued an ultimatum, demanding that we make concessions. Heavy troops have been deployed near Zhuwo, Dege, and Zhanhua counties, exerting severe pressure. Liu Wenhui's original cable states: According to a cable from Deng, the brigade commander stationed in Kang, 1. Jiang Qingyuan, the county magistrate of Dege, urgently reports receiving a letter from Zhen Dongkalun stating that while the Sichuan-Tibet peace talks were in progress last year, the Sichuan side privately mobilized troops and occupied Zhuwo, Dege, Zhanhua, and other places belonging to the Tibetan side, causing great unease among Tibetan civil and military officials. The Qinghai-Tibet negotiations have now been successfully completed, bringing immense joy to the Tibetan monks, laity, and general population. The Sichuan-Tibet negotiations should also be concluded. I have now instructed the Keji and Jika representatives stationed in Dege to deliver a letter to your Excellency, requesting a face-to-face negotiation and discussion, etc. 2. According to reconnaissance reports, the Tibetan side has increased its troops by 200 at each ferry crossing along the river, either half a day or a day's journey apart. Also, 1,000 Tibetan troops from Naduo, who were withdrawn after the successful conclusion of the Qinghai-Tibet negotiations, have now returned to Naduo. It is believed that the Tibetan side's actions are merely intended to expand the buffer zone and take advantage of the ongoing Sichuan war, hoping to overturn the agreement. In addition to ordering the troops stationed in Xikang to be on high alert and to refrain from initiating conflicts, I have also sent a cable to Magistrate Jiang, instructing him to reply to the Tibetan side, informing them that the ceasefire agreement of last year was negotiated and signed by both Sichuan and Tibet and reported to the central government. It should be jointly observed. The Tibetan side's proposals, which exceed the terms of the agreement, cannot be answered. The Tibetan side should forward them to the Dalai Lama and directly propose them to the central government. I have also instructed the county magistrate to meet with the Keji and Jika representatives and politely decline. (Special dispatch, 8th)</p>

<h3 id="e83">Measures to Reorganize the North China Army Reached <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>The Military Sub-Committee Decided to Cut Troops and Reduce Salaries</p>
<p>Implementation to Begin This Month</p>
<p>Difficulty in Counting Troops, Permitting Self-Reduction</p>
<p>Resolution of the Chahar Incident, Troops Begin to Be Re-Deployed</p>
<p>Beiping Special Dispatch: The war zone has been completely taken over, and the Chahar incident has been largely resolved. The current issues in North China are the reorganization of the army and finances. The reorganization of finances is currently being discussed in detail by Huang Fu and Wang Kemin with the central government. It will not be completely finalized until after the Lushan Conference. Regarding the reorganization of the army, Huang Shaoxiong brought back a reorganization plan from Lushan when he returned north. After discussions between He Yingqin and the various North China generals, the outline has been established. The North China army has undergone repeated changes and is extremely complex. Roughly speaking, it can be divided into the Northeast Army and miscellaneous troops. Before the September 18th Incident, the four provinces of Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, and Rehe had not been lost by the Northeast Army, and the military pay did not entirely come from North China. Only the garrison in the Pass was temporarily within the scope of North China. Since September 18th, the three provinces of Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang have fallen, and Rehe has been entangled. The remaining Northeast Army has gathered in North China, and all the pay has relied entirely on North China for supply. Before the Rehe War, the Northeast Army was organized into brigades. Later, in preparation for war, the brigades were reorganized into divisions, expanding the scope. After the Rehe War, there was a reorganization, divided into three armies, led by Yu Xuezhong, He Guozhao, Wang Yizhe, etc. The number of divisions did not change, only the jurisdiction was slightly adjusted. The number of soldiers in each division was fundamentally insufficient due to the reorganization from brigades, and after the war, it was even more difficult for reality to match the name. However, the payment of military pay remained the same as before and did not change in the slightest. The miscellaneous troops include a wide range, including Shang Zhen's 32nd Army, Song Zheyuan's 29th Army, Sun Dianying's 41st Army, Pang Bingxun's 40th Army, Gao Guizi's 84th Division, and Shen Ke's Provisional First Division. Shang Zhen commanded three divisions: Gao Hongwen, Li Xingcun, and Huang Guanghua. Song Zheyuan originally commanded two divisions: Feng Zhian and Zhang Zizhong. After the Battle of Xifengkou, Zhao Dengyu's division was added. Sun Dianying's troops have recently expanded, in addition to the original 41st Army, incorporating the 55th Army and the Cavalry Army. Pang Bingxun's troops originally had four regiments. Li Fuhe's division of the Northeast Army has also recently been placed under his command. Gao Guizi's troops were originally an independent division. During the Anti-Japanese War, they were temporarily placed under the command of Shang Zhen, and Gao served as Shang's deputy commander-in-chief. Shen Ke's troops were originally under the command of Pang Bingxun, but recently changed to an independent division. During the Anti-Japanese War, each army increased rather than decreased, leading to huge military expenditures. After the war, the local area was dilapidated and finances were difficult. Without reorganization, not only would the organization be complex, but there would be no source for such large military expenditures. Day after day, how could it continue?</p>
<p>During Zhang Xueliang's era, the monthly cost of military pay and clothing for the North China armies was about 7 million. After He Yingqin arrived in Beiping, it was tightened once and reduced to just over 5 million. There was still a large deficit after offsetting income and expenses. When Zhang Xueliang was in charge in Beiping, he could not cope with the situation of having less income than expenses, so he came up with various ways to deduct (1) paying the troops once every thirty-five days, paying only ten times a year, invisibly reducing the pay for two months, (2) the military pay was discounted by 20%, and then discounted again by 20%, eighty-eight is sixty-four, the actual pay was only 64%. With such deductions, it was barely maintained. He Yingqin continued the old rules after coming north, and although it was tightened once, it was still felt that it was difficult to cope. It is now September, and the armies have only been paid four times, with arrears accumulating day by day. Reorganization is imminent.</p>
<p>The reorganization of the army should originally eliminate the weak and retain the strong, carry out practical reorganization, and strictly count the troops for the purpose of downsizing. However, due to the difficulty of reversing the accumulated problems, counting the troops is difficult, and even if there is a desire to count the troops, it is only nominal, and strict reorganization is truly difficult to achieve. We can only deal with it perfunctorily and handle it in a flexible way. Now, after the military sub-committee's deliberation on military pay, it has been decided to implement troop and salary reductions starting this month. The reduction methods are (1) a new establishment will be set, reducing the number of people in each company by more than 30, to be reduced automatically by each army (2) the military sub-committee will verify and reduce military pay, depending on the situation of each army, making reductions of 50,000 to 60,000, 20,000 to 30,000, or even several thousand, with a total reduction of more than 700,000. After such reductions, the monthly reduction can be reduced to just over 4 million, and the difference between income and expenditure is slightly better than before. As for the military sub-committee itself, it is also engaging in personnel cuts and salary reductions to demonstrate thrift. At yesterday's routine meeting of the military sub-committee, it was resolved that all nominal personnel such as consultants and advisers would be changed to honorary positions and salaries would be suspended temporarily.</p>
<p>During the Anti-Japanese War, the armies were mobilized north to kill enemies and defend the country. After the war ended, the Chahar incident arose, and they were unable to return. Now that the Chahar incident has been resolved, the armies are beginning to be demobilized and redeployed. Some of the Central Army that came north has already gone south, and the remaining units will also be demobilized as appropriate. Feng Qinzai's troops will still be transferred back to Shaanxi. Shang Zhen's troops have been ordered to return to the Pinghan Line and garrison between Zhangde and Xuchang. Gao Guizi's troops will be transferred to garrison between Cizhou and Zhengzhou. He Zhuguo's troops will be transferred to garrison around Shijiazhuang and Handan. Each army is currently in the process of being transferred. The large army in the suburbs of Beiping will be transferred elsewhere one after another, gradually returning to normal. (September 7th)</p>

The most important aspect is to use the new spirit that Song brought back from Europe and America as the key element for improving everything. (September 7th)</p>
<h3 id="e85">Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission Formulates Yellow River Management Plan <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>Divided into Three Engineering Projects: Closing Breaches, Repairing Dams, and Strengthening Dikes</p>
<p>Jinan Dispatch: Regarding the overall plan for managing the Yellow River in Hebei, Shandong, and Henan, the flood prevention conference has decided to entrust the Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission to take charge. The commission plans to establish temporary engineering offices in the three provinces immediately to actively carry out construction. Xu Xinwu, a member of the commission, and engineers Wang Fengjae and Lu Keming arrived in Jinan yesterday and paid a visit to Chairman Han today to discuss construction methods. Han expressed strong support for their plan. Xu spoke in detail to reporters about the specific plans for managing the Yellow River, which are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e86">Temporary Engineering Offices to be Established in Various Provinces <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>Xu said, "I departed from Bian on the 3rd of this month, passing through Lanfeng, Kaocheng, Zhengzhou, Wenxian, Wuzhi, Rongze, and other places along the way, observing the situation. I arrived in Jinan via Xuzhou. After consulting with the provincial governments regarding the aftermath of the Yellow River, the commission will implement the plan. Because the Yellow River flood this time has affected several provinces, the Huai River Conservancy Commission and the Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission from Hebei, Shandong, Henan, Jiangsu, Anhui, and Shaanxi have gathered together to discuss flood prevention issues. As a result, the Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission has been entrusted with the management of the Yellow River. After receiving this commission, we have drafted methods for handling the aftermath of the Yellow River and will establish temporary engineering offices in the provinces affected by the flood. The first district will be located in Kaifeng, Henan; the second in Changyuan, Hebei; and the third in Heze, Shandong. The first district has already been established. My purpose in coming to Shandong this time is to discuss with Chairman Han the establishment of the third district's temporary engineering office. Then I will go to Hebei to discuss the methods for the third district's engineering office. The principle of the commission's management of the Yellow River this time is to cooperate with the provincial governments. The heads of the engineering offices in each district will be concurrently held by the directors of the river affairs bureaus of the respective provinces. The heads will manage the administration, and the engineers from the commission will manage the engineering. The head of the Henan engineering office is Chen Ruzhen, the director of the river affairs bureau, and the engineer is Cai Lianggong. The engineer for the second district is Wang Fengjae, and the engineer for the third district in Shandong is planned to be Lu Keming. Although the three districts are divided according to provinces this time, they are not strictly defined, in order to facilitate the work."</p>
<h3 id="e87">Funding and Steps of Work <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>The commission has formulated three steps for managing the Yellow River: (1) Closing the breaches; (2) Repairing dams at dangerous points; (3) Repairing the main dikes. The work is not very difficult, but funding is a major issue. The Executive Yuan has allocated 500,000 yuan for emergency projects, but in reality, 500,000 yuan is far from enough. Therefore, the flood prevention conference has resolved to allocate 10 million yuan for Yellow River management projects. However, this is just a request from the flood prevention conference, and it is not yet known whether it can be achieved. When I was leaving Beijing, I visited President Wang, and President Wang promised to allocate 500,000 yuan to cope with the first phase of the project, with subsequent allocations to follow. Therefore, while closing the breaches to meet the demands of the people, we are also planning to repair the dams. We will do as much as we can depending on how much funding the central government allocates. Because the commission is responsible for the technical aspects, we are planning ahead. In addition to planning to close the breaches first, we are also planning the entire river project. If more funds continue to be allocated, the project will continue. Regarding this point, Chairman Han of this province also advocates closing the breaches first and then repairing the entire river, which is the same view. There are many dangerous points along the upper and lower reaches of the Yellow River. If adequate funds are available, proper repairs can be made to avoid danger. Otherwise, there is a possibility of danger occurring every year due to major floods.</p>
<h3 id="e88">Lanfeng and Zhengzhou are Most Important <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the breach situation, I have seen it in Henan. (1) The Lanfeng breach is a levee breach. (2) The Kaocheng breach is a scour breach. (3) At the north bank of Zhengzhou, the local area has already closed a part of it. (4) The Wenxian levee breach is 50 li long. Closing the Kaocheng and Lanfeng breaches is not difficult, but the East Dam project is important. Western Shandong and northern Jiangsu are in danger of being damaged. The topography there is that the Yellow River comes from the west, and at the head of the East Dam in Lanfeng, it turns north in a large bend and then flows east. West of the East Dam, there is an old breach, which is the old Yellow River. The constructed dike is called the New Dike. East of the head of the East Dam, there is a gap in the main dike that has not been closed. North of the dike there is a ring dike, and north of the ring dike there is a people's dike. The breach this time was caused by the floodwater coming from the north to the south, first overflowing the people's dike, traveling south for 20 li, then breaching the ring dike, flowing out from the old gap in the main dike, and flooding Kaocheng. According to common sense, river water that overflows a people's dike and travels 20 li would not have much force. Unexpectedly, the force of the water this time was so great, which is shocking. Therefore, in terms of the situation, it is easy to close the Lanfeng breach, but to avoid the danger in western Shandong and northern Jiangsu, the East Dam project is very important. Furthermore, regarding the Zhengzhou project, the Yellow River Railway Bridge spans the river. The southern end is on the south bank of the river, and the northern end is built on the old river beach. According to the chief of the Pinghan Railway section, before the accident, the main current was close to the south bank, with a depth of more than 30 zhang. Unexpectedly, within 24 hours, the main current shifted to the north bank, and the south bank silted up into a large beach, 7 li away from the south bank. The main current shifted north and breached the dike, flowing north from Zhan Dian. The local people then tore open the railway to avoid being flooded. Many persuasions could not stop them. In terms of the situation here, closing the breach is not very difficult, but strengthening the north bank is very important. If it is breached, the river water may seize the Wei River and change its course to the sea. North China will suffer an unprecedented major flood. The above situation is of great importance and is a national issue, not a local one.</p>
<h3 id="e89">Repairing Dams at Various Dangerous Points <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>The Lanfeng East Dam and the Pinghan Railway Bridge are all very important. The river dams should be repaired immediately. In Hebei, there is one breach at the south bank and 32 large and small breaches within 70 li on the north bank. The interests are all related to Shandong. Therefore, the breach closing project is most burdensome in Hebei, followed by Henan. In addition, there are many places along the river where dams need to be repaired. Furthermore, the entire dike needs to be repaired because low dikes are prone to overflowing and thin dikes are prone to being breached. Therefore, they must be raised and thickened to ensure safety. The above projects are just planned in this way. Whether they can be achieved depends entirely on the central government's financial resources.</p>
<h3 id="e90">Han of Shandong Endorses This Plan <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>After Xu and others visited Han, reporters visited again. At that time, Zhang Lianjia, director of the Shandong River Affairs Bureau, was discussing engineering issues with Xu and others. Wang Yaodan received them. According to him, the purpose of visiting Han was to seek Han's opinion on this plan and to request the transfer of Director Zhang (Lianjia) to be the head of the third district's engineering office and to transfer river workers from Shandong Province to work in the third district. Han not only expressed strong support for this but had no other comments. He also strongly supported the transfer of Shandong river workers and immediately appointed Director Zhang to discuss the current engineering issues with us in detail. The main engineering project to be undertaken in the third district is the repair and closure of the breach at Erfen Zhuang. The engineering office can be established within two or three days and begin collecting materials. Once the materials are collected, the repair work will begin immediately. The principle of this district's project is that the central government will allocate funds and Shandong will provide personnel. Chairman Han and Director Zhang have both stated that it is very good and advocated that it should be done as quickly as possible. (6th)</p>
<h3 id="e91">Yellow River Breach Closure to Begin This Month <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the construction methods for closing the breach, according to Wang Xi today, the Yellow River breach has not been closed for more than a month. The river water is flowing out vigorously, and the water in the disaster area has increased rather than decreased. Most of the victims are trapped in the water, and all relief efforts are difficult to carry out. Moreover, winter is approaching, and relief will be even more difficult. It will not be easy to close the breach in the cold weather. Therefore, the only urgent task now is to close the breach. After we arrived in Jinan, we contacted the local officials several times and decided that the south bank of the Erfen Zhuang breach (the breach is actually at Xiao Pang Zhuang, east of Erfen Zhuang) will be closed by the third district. Because Changyuan County there belongs to Hebei Province, Commissioner Xu (Xinwu) will go to Tianjin tomorrow to discuss the security of the construction area with Chairman Yu. Today, Xu discussed with Zhang Honglie, director of the Construction Department of Shandong, and Zhang Lianjia, director of the River Affairs Bureau, and decided that Director Zhang, Lu (Keming), and I will go to Dongming Erfen Zhuang in two or three days to survey the project. I am responsible for the engineering affairs of the second district, so I will cross the river from Erfen Zhuang to the north bank to prepare everything. Regarding the engineering issues of the second district, I have already contacted Sun Qingze, director of the Hebei River Affairs Bureau. Therefore, I will go to Batou Town in Changyuan County in three or four days to organize the engineering office. The first step in closing the breach is to conduct an on-site survey, estimate the amount of materials needed, purchase them, and then organize the engineering office to supervise the work. The Erfen Zhuang breach is one kilometer wide and has no main current, so closing the breach should not be difficult. The north bank has 32 large and small breaches with a total width of more than 3 kilometers. If materials are purchased from western Shandong, it will be difficult because western Shandong has been flooded, and it will also be difficult to transport them upstream by boat. Therefore, it has been decided to purchase materials near Lanfeng. The materials needed are mainly sorghum stalks, and the old method will still be used to close the breach. The temporary engineering office of the third district will be located in Jinan in the future. The office was originally planned to be located in Heze, but now it has been moved to Gao Zhuang because Heze is far from the work area. Construction can begin in one month, and it is hoped that the closure can be completed by the end of the year to complete the first phase of the plan. The project cost is currently 20,000 yuan.

<p>Great Interest in Visiting Beiping, Praises Kaihua Paper as Comparable to Swedish Paper,盛称故宫建築偉大華茶亟應加以改良北平特訉Great Praise for the Great Architecture of the Forbidden City, Chinese Tea Urgently Needs to be Improved.</p>
<p>Beiping Special Dispatch: Prince Carl of Sweden has been in Beiping for several days, and his interest in sightseeing and touring is very strong. As of today (7th), he has visited Zhongshan Park, Taimiao, the Temple of Heaven, the Confucius Temple, the Imperial College, Yonghe Temple, Beihai Park, the Summer Palace, the Great Wall, and also visited the National Beiping Library, the Relics Exhibition Hall, the Three Great Halls, the Museum of History, the Palace Museum, and attended banquets hosted by He Yingqin, acting chairman of the Military Branch, and Yuan Liang, mayor of Beiping. Prince Carl's interest in visiting Beiping is stronger than in any other place. The reporter specially interviewed Prince Carl, and the main points of the conversation are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e93">The Glory of Chinese Paper <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>This time I came to China because I have long admired Chinese cultural monuments, so I came to visit, completely as an individual tourist to admire the scenery, study academic knowledge, and examine the beautiful customs and cultural systems of China, and I do not represent the Swedish government and have absolutely no mission. The Chinese paper industry was originally very developed. As far as I know, Cai Lun of the Han Dynasty invented paper, using tree bark, hemp heads, old cloth, and fishing nets as paper. The world called it Cai Hou Paper, which shows that the Chinese paper industry had inventions thousands of years before paper was used in Europe. During the Qianlong era of the Qing Dynasty, Kaihua paper reached its peak. In the middle of the Qing Dynasty, Lian Si paper was cheap and required less labor, so Kaihua paper became an antique. Because China invented paper the earliest, ancient culture was also very early. Modern papermaking in Sweden is quite developed. Although the quality of the paper is excellent, the fineness of the materials is not as good as that of Chinese Kaihua paper. Swedish paper is the best in Europe and can print five-color overprints. Europeans all say that Chinese paper cannot print five-color paintings, only use colored painting. But that's not true. The temple block books I saw in the Palace Museum in Beiping were printed on Kaihua paper, and their five-color pictures were completely printed on the whitest Kaihua paper, and they have not faded for hundreds of years and are as bright as newly painted. Its printing method uses one side of the paper, which is different from the two-sided printing of Swedish paper. Two-sided printing is certainly more economical, but if the printed book is out of print, it will be harmed on both sides if it encounters stupid insects. If one side of the Chinese paper is used for printing, only one side will be damaged when it encounters stupid insects, which is also an advantage of Chinese paper. If printing newspapers, Swedish paper is still the best, one because of two-sided printing, and two because the paper is thicker. If Chinese papermaking is improved, it will join hands with the Swedish paper industry in the future to jointly promote the development of the paper industry and promote Eastern and Western culture, which is a valuable undertaking.</p>

<h3 id="e94">Representative of Ancient Culture <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>My brothers and sisters have all come to China. (The Swedish Royal Family) Five or six years ago, 余 talked about Chinese industry and commerce. Today, Chinese industry and commerce have indeed made considerable progress compared to five or six years ago. Zhongshan 　in Nanjing, East and West Chang'an Streets and Fuyou Street in Beiping all have new black roads, and railroad transfers are also better than before. It is expected that there will be even greater progress in the future. Beiping is the ancient capital of the Chinese emperors of the past dynasties. Various buildings contain the meaning of Eastern art. The architecture of the Forbidden City is larger than the Swedish Royal Palace. Although some of the antiques stored in the palaces have been transported to the south, there are still many that have not been transported. I have a few eye blessings to visit. In short, Beiping can represent the ancient Chinese style of culture. There are many empty spaces in Nanjing. The National Government has established its capital in Nanjing, and all construction projects are just beginning. Nanjing can represent the modern Chinese style of civilization. Ancient culture should be preserved, and modern civilization should also be developed. The Chinese people love peace. Although there are disadvantages, most countries in the world sympathize with China. The people of Sweden are also very peaceful. The country has been peaceful and prosperous for decades. Although it is in the midst of the European panic, Sweden is not affected. There are fewer unemployed people in the country than in other countries. China is in this chaotic world and has not been greatly affected by it. The people of both countries can be proud of this. Although our industry and commerce are gradually developing, there are not many industrial and commercial interests in Beiping, so there is no minister in Beiping. All matters are handled by the Swedish Chargé d'Affaires or Consul General in Shanghai, but I hope that Swedish industry and commerce will develop in China and that ministers will be added in the future to coexist and prosper with China.</p>
<h3 id="e95">Jiang and Song are Special Talents <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>I believe that China is currently in a period of evolution, and the future prospects are unlimited. For example, Chairman Chiang (Kai-shek) and Minister Song (Ziwen) are both special talents in China's military and economy. The National Government also has full governing power. Your country is located in the East Asian continent, rich in resources, and industry and commerce are striving for progress. Sweden is located in northern Western Europe. Although the national territory is not as large as China, due to geographical relations, it has made great efforts in industry and national defense. The world is wrongly praised, and many say that our country's industry is comparable to the United States, and weapons are even superior to Germany. This kind of words is enough to encourage our country to work harder in national defense and industry. Most of China's natural treasures have not been exploited. In the future, many countries in the world will rely on your country. Our country is located in the far north of Europe, close to the frigid zone, and the climate is extremely cold. People are mostly resistant to cold and are proficient in skiing and skating. Every summer, there is sunlight day and night. When sleeping at night, most people cover the windows with curtains to avoid the sun shining in. In winter, you can only see four hours of sunlight a day, which is not common in temperate countries. I hope that the reporters will visit our country, and I will welcome you. I am now working on economic research and will engage in commercial development in the future. I hope to exchange well-known Swedish paper and steel for Chinese native products such as soybeans, tea, and silk.</p>
<h3 id="e96">Sweden Welcomes Chinese Tea <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>The people of our country welcome your country's tea very much, but in recent years, various countries have also promoted tea planting, which has greatly hit Chinese tea, and the tea planted in a certain country in the East mostly pretends to be Chinese tea for sale, confusing the fish with the pearls, which is chilling. In fact, the one that is welcome in Sweden is still the real Chinese tea. I am now scheduled to leave Ping for Tianjin on the 9th, and will only stay in Tianjin for a few hours before going to Qingdao. I will only stay in Qingdao for a short time before going to Shanghai. Shanghai is the center of China's economy and has long been famous in the world. Although it has been ravaged by a certain country, I believe that it can achieve the hope of revival in the shortest time. I will leave Shanghai on the 29th and may go to Hankou before returning to Sweden. (7th Jin)</p>

<p>Reviewing Troops Along the Way and Soliciting Public Opinion</p>
<p>A Military Conference Was Convened After Arriving at Songbu</p>
<p>Zhang Qun and His Party Returned to Hubei by Car from Hunan</p>
<p>Hankou Dispatch: He Chengjun, the Pacification Commissioner of Hubei, departed from Hankou by car at 10 a.m. on the 7th to inspect eastern Hubei. The accompanying personnel included senior staff officer Xu Chengxi, staff officer Chen Yucang, adjutant Zhao Yixue, Wang Renshan, Cheng Ruhai, administrative commissioner of the Fourth District, and Chen Shuzi, director of the 13th Division's office in Hankou. The garrison commander and garrison brigade commander Ye Peng also personally led a machine gun company and a special service platoon to escort him. He talked about the tasks of this trip before the journey: (1) Inspect the situation of the aftermath in the recovered bandit areas; (2) Deeply into the countryside to inquire about the sufferings of the people; (3) Investigate the military discipline and style of the stationed troops; (4) Confer with the generals to wipe out the remaining bandits and instruct them on the appropriate measures. He's car arrived in Huangpi at 12 noon. The army brigade commander Liu Yifeng, the county magistrate Hua Wenxuan, and representatives of the people greeted him ten li away. He successively summoned officers and soldiers of the special service brigade and public groups to give speeches, and then proceeded to Qiting. Ye Peng returned to Hankou from Huangpi because the security of Wuhan was important. It was heard that after He arrived in Qiting, he inspected Zhang Liansan's troops and ordered them to quickly move to the new defense area in southern Hubei. He then went to Songbu to convene a military conference for the bandit suppression generals. It is reported that General Commander Sun Lianzhong and Division Commander Wan Yaohuang, and Peng Zhensan have arrived in Songbu to welcome him. Both Army Commander Shangguan Yunxiang and Army Commander Hao Mengling arrived in Macheng and will go to Songbu to attend the meeting. He will leave Songbu to inspect the counties of Songma after the meeting is held, and will return to Hankou within a week. When He left Hankou, Zhang Qun was returning to Hubei from Hunan. Zhang and Construction Director Li Fanyi, Education Director Cheng Qibao, departed from Wuchang on the 1st and arrived in Changsha on the 2nd, and then discussed the aftermath of the bandit area in southern Hubei with Commander-in-Chief He Jian in detail. Both the problems of cooperation for water conservancy in Xiang and E were resolved and specific plans were determined, and they also visited various constructions and traveled to famous places such as Nanyue and Yuelu. On the 6th, Zhang and the two directors Li and Cheng returned to Hubei on a special express train on the Xiang-E Road. At 8 a.m. on the 7th, they arrived in Wuchang. At 12 noon on the same day, the provincial government convened a meeting to discuss the post-disaster plan for western Hubei. It was decided to formally propose the plan to the provincial government's regular meeting on the 8th for implementation. (7th)</p>

<p>Yi Peiji Did Not Attend Due to Illness, Represented by Wu Ying</p>
<p>Yuan Liang's Inventory Will Take About a Month to Complete</p>
<p>Beiping Special Dispatch: The issue of the takeover of the Palace Museum is quite complicated. The new acting director Ma Heng exchanged opinions with the former director Yi Peiji beforehand. After the principles and methods were stipulated, the takeover began in two parts on the 6th. The situation of each party is recorded as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e99">Takeover Situation <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>At 9 a.m. on the 6th, the new acting director Ma Heng and the inventory committee member Yuan Liang arrived at the museum one after another. The takeover committee members Wang Shiduo, Yu Heyin, Zhuang Shangyan (Wu Yu Zhang on behalf), Yu Gai, He Chengyi, Li Yihua (Duan Qiongchu on behalf), Huang Pengxiao (Shan Shikui on behalf), Wang Meizhuang, Dong Yinfu, Cheng Zushao, Li Xiuda, Dai Zengpei, Su Yongzhong, and the handover committee members Yu Tongkui, Wu Ying, Zhou Shinan, Yu Heyin, Xu Wenzhen, Cheng Runtang, and others also arrived at the museum on time. The former director Yi Peiji did not attend due to illness and was represented by Secretary Wu Ying. At about 10 a.m., the personnel of the two committees, the handover and takeover committees, and the new director Ma Heng held a joint meeting and began to discuss the handover procedures. After the ceremony, the takeover of the two parts was carried out: (1) The administrative part was completed on the 6th. (2) The item part. Because the number was too large, one part was handed over every day. The method of random inspection was used. The inventory committee member Yuan Liang, who was very busy due to government affairs, expressed at the meeting that he was responsible for supervising all the procedures of the handover on the orders of the Executive Yuan. Regarding whether there was any corruption in the handover of various affairs and items, he could be responsible for exposing it. Yuan left after sitting for a while and then sent Wang Yu Kui, chief of the first section of the municipal government, to represent him, supervisor and committee member can attend the meeting before taking over the items. The item part was officially accepted on the 6th. There was no time limit set for the handover. It should take about one month to complete.</p>
<h3 id="e100">Consultation Process <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>After the board of directors of the Palace Museum approved the resignation of Director Yi Peiji and Secretary-General Li Zongtong, Ma Heng was appointed as acting director. At that time, Ma was in the Beijing-Shanghai area and sent a telegram to Xu Hongbao to be the secretary-general. After Xu arrived at the museum to take office, he discussed the takeover matters with Wu Ying, the former secretary of the Palace Museum, several times. Wu repeatedly asked the former director Yi Peiji for instructions. As a result, the new and old parties agreed on the takeover method. Yi organized a handover committee and Ma organized a takeover committee. When Ma returned to Ping, this principle had been completely determined. Ma also considered the actual situation with all parties and decided to start the takeover on September 6th. For items that were inventoried, those with draft books would be neatly transcribed, and those with inventories would be handed over according to the inventories. If there were items that were transferred between the archives, antiquities, and library, they must be returned to the original archive before they can be handed over. The daily office hours were stipulated, and the responsible personnel from both sides went to the museum to work on time. If it could not be completed in one month, it would be extended.</p>
<h3 id="e101">Reorganization Methods <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>The method of changing the organization of the Palace Museum is that the Executive Yuan first formulates the principles and then hands them over to the Legislative Yuan to draft. These principles have already been internally decided, and the detailed content has not yet been announced, so the public announcement is temporarily delayed. Therefore, it is of course necessary to change the various organizations at this time. A part of the valuable antiquities has already been transported south in five batches. Now that the situation in the north has stabilized, some of these antiquities must be transported back, and some must be kept in the south. The antiquities kept in the south will be displayed in the Nanjing branch when it is established. As for how to allocate the antiquities, it will be discussed at the next board meeting. However, since the Palace Museum has a branch, there will naturally be changes in the organization. (7th Jin)</p>
<h3 id="e102">Fatal Electrocution of Telephone Worker in Songjiang <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday (the 7th) at 7:30 PM, an electric light wire near the tax police training center at Dong School Field in this city suddenly snapped and fell onto a telephone line, cutting off telephone service to the training center and causing thick smoke and occasional sparks to erupt from the switchboard inside the telephone company's central office. Personnel were dispatched to investigate and, after determining the situation, immediately notified the electric light company to temporarily shut off the circuit. Five workers were sent to repair the line. As it was nighttime, the telephone workers assumed the circuit had been shut off and there was no danger. They proceeded to disentangle the broken electric light wire from the telephone wire. Unexpectedly, the circuit had not been shut off, and the broken cable fell, striking telephone worker Hu Huigen. Hu fell to the ground. Another worker, Wu Ahe, seeing this, rushed to help and was also electrocuted and fell. Another worker used a wooden board to push the electric wire away. Two workers on the utility pole, witnessing their comrades' tragic deaths, were so frightened that they fell and injured their backs. The training center then notified the telephone company, and the dead and injured workers were taken to Songjiang Hospital. Except for Hu and Wu, whose bodies were charred beyond saving, the two injured workers were not in mortal danger. After the telephone workers' tragic deaths, the electric light company finally sent workers. The training center had notified the company three times, but the workers arrived only after a long delay, leading to this disaster. Responsibility is clearly assigned, and two electric light workers have been temporarily detained.</p>
<h3 id="e103">Suzhou and Jiangyin to Soon Establish Airfields <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>Xu Ligeng, leader of the aerial photography team of the Aviation Survey Unit of the General Staff Headquarters, flew to Suzhou in the Survey No. 2 aircraft. The surveying of flight routes has already been noted in this newspaper. That night, Xu and his team stayed at the Dongwu Hotel outside the Changmen gate. A reporter visited them. According to Xu, they had recently returned from Nanchang, having first gone to a location in Anhui Province to establish a fortress. However, because the terrain near Jiangyin was considered more important, they were ordered by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to go there. Since there was no airfield near Jiangyin, they stopped in Suzhou. Furthermore, because they were ordered to depart in haste, they had not been able to notify the local airfield in advance, so there were no preparations. As a result, the plane's wheels were caught in the weeds upon landing. Xu had initially thought that the Suzhou airfield would have oil and a protection team, but these were lacking. Therefore, after landing, he immediately contacted the county government to request assistance and arranged for water police to provide protection. He also personally funded the hiring of laborers to remove the weeds from the airfield, with a deadline of [the] 8th to complete the work. He had already entrusted the Meifu Petroleum Company's Shanghai agent with providing the needed oil. If everything can be completed as scheduled today, [the] 9th, they can take off and begin work. Xu also mentioned that the aircraft was a [blank], so even though there was no [blank] in the airfield, parking in the open air was not a problem. At [blank] time, pilot Zhu Daxian, an Indian, returned from outside. Xu immediately pointed him out to the reporter, saying that during the January 28th Incident, pilot Zhu had shot down two Japanese aircraft. Zhu had also been injured in the left waist, and still had a scar. The reporter expressed his admiration for Zhu.</p>

<p>The butchers of this county, oppressed by the tax collectors of slaughter tax, convened an emergency meeting of all the butchers of the county on the afternoon of the 5th at the Wujiang County Chamber of Commerce.

<p>Qin Zhizhong, the principal of the privately established Peixi Primary School outside Ximen in this county, was suddenly accused by Zhang Baiyun and others to the provincial government last month. Later, additional problems arose when Yu Zengyuan, a citizen of the Western District, published an advertisement stating that Qin Zhizhong's appointment as principal of the school was due to the use of him by Li Guozhang, a teacher at the school. Because Li Guozhang had previously been ordered to never be employed again and did not have the qualifications of a principal, he had to use a false name. In reality, the full authority of the school was completely in Li's hands. Now, Principal Qin was suffering for others and those who levied exorbitant taxes were still in office, etc. After seeing the report, Li also published a rebuttal and described his achievements in running the school. He also filed a defamation lawsuit against Yu Zengyuan in the criminal court of the county court. Yesterday, Judge Lai Sihu ruled that Yu Zengyuan was sentenced to two months in prison, suspended for two years, and ordered the entire verdict to be published in the newspaper. After hearing the verdict, Yu Zengyuan, feeling angry, went straight to the Santai Rice Shop outside the Ximen shed and met with Yang Zhongzi, a school director of Peixi School. He requested that the board of directors meeting be convened to replace Li Guozhang. Because Yang could not agree to this immediately, Yu jumped into the river at Ximen Bridge in an attempt to end his life. Fortunately, he was pulled out of the water, but he had become a drowned chicken. Yu sat blankly on the shore, talking eloquently about his willingness to fight to the end for Peixi and sacrifice his life to express his heart. He had now lost the lawsuit and could not afford to appeal because the expenses required for the last hearing had been covered by pawning clothes for one dollar. Those who heard about it sighed in regret. Then, Yang Zhongzi agreed to convene a board of directors meeting to resolve the matter, and Yu knelt down and thanked him before leaving.</p>

<p>The Qiantang River tide, every Mid-Autumn Festival, is surging and magnificent, a spectacular sight. Tens of thousands of Chinese and foreigners come to Zhejiang to watch the tide every year. The Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway has added a special train for tide watching. Because the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway has long been directly open to traffic, Shanghai and Haining are the only places on the Shanghai-Lai-Hangzhou route, tide watchers will inevitably change to the highway. In view of this, the Provincial Highway Bureau has decided to add a special Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway train for tide watching from the 29th of this month to facilitate tide watchers, starting from Minhang and ending at the Haining Bapu tide-watching destination. Two classes will run up and down the highway on the 8th, and Wang Shaoyi and Zhong Jihui have been assigned to be responsible for the preparation and reception matters. A number of tide-watching stands have been built in Haining, each of which can accommodate more than 500 people. Fearing that there will not be enough passenger cars at that time, travelers are specifically notified that they can make reservations in advance to avoid disappointment.</p>

<p>Dear Sirs, after reading the communication from Fenyi in your newspaper's report on its survey of Jiangxi, Anhui, Hunan and Hubei on August 22, it was stated that Magistrate Cheng Zhenxi of Qingjiang County said that the China International Famine Relief Commission had released a loan of 30,000 yuan, which had resulted in the farmers being harmed by unscrupulous local officials who extracted high interest rates and that the shortage of arable land this spring was because farmers had to sell their cattle to repay their debts, etc. After investigation, Qingjiang is not an agricultural relief county, but a cooperative county. The loan was handled by our association's office in Jiangxi, which only began operations in May of this year. The first repayment installment is not due until the end of this year. So, the so-called farmers selling cattle to repay their debts this spring is unclear. The paragraph in the above communication is obviously a misunderstanding of hearsay. As the matter concerns the future of cooperation, in addition to sending another letter to the Qingjiang County Magistrate for inquiry, we are sending this letter to request you to quickly correct the record in order to show the facts. Sincerely, the China International Famine Relief Commission, September 4.</p>

<p>The personnel to carry out the naming ceremony for the five aircraft have been recommended by the five groups. As for the ceremony of breaking the bottle and raising the aircraft, the Shanghai Labor [blank] School, Shanghai Boy Scout, and Ningbo aircraft have also been recommended and seen in various newspapers. The City Chamber of Commerce also recommended Ms. Wu Ruilun yesterday to perform the breaking of the bottle and raising ceremony for the Shanghai Merchant aircraft. Ms. Wu is an employee of the Shanghai Silk Industry Bank, 20 years old, from Jiangning County, Jiangsu Province, and graduated from Jiangsu Provincial Shanghai Middle School. The Air Ascension Ceremony for the Boy Scout aircraft, which was originally to be performed by Ms. Deng Jinghang, has been changed to be performed by Ms. Chen Yuru due to Ms. Deng's illness.</p>

<p>After the naming ceremony today, the aircraft school instructors will fly in formation and perform a variety of amazing and leaping skills, which will be more lively than the previous naming ceremony of the Shanghai Aircraft in Jiangwan. It is expected that tens of thousands of people will go to Hongqiao to see the grand ceremony, and young German-trained aviator Sun Tonggang will also show off his skills at that time.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, General Labor Union, Educational Association, Ningbo Sojourners Association in Shanghai, and the Shanghai Boy Scouts, five organizations in total, will distribute leaflets on the occasion. The text reads, "Dear citizens, our country is in a time of increasing foreign troubles. If we do not urgently catch up and build up our air defense, how can we resist insults and defend ourselves? The members of our business community, learning from past mistakes, are inspired and invigorated. They are enthusiastically saving unnecessary expenses and cutting out wasteful costs to donate funds for the purchase of a warplane, named 'Shanghai Merchant,' to fulfill their sacred duty of saving the country. We also hope that citizens will encourage each other to donate generously, so that the spirit will rise throughout the country and jointly advocate 'saving the country through aviation.' [Issued by the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce of the Chinese Aviation Association]"</p>
<p>"Dear citizens, without an air force, there is no national defense; without national defense, we are at the mercy of others. The past is not far away and serves as a warning. Therefore, saving the country through aviation is truly an urgent task. The workers of this city have jointly resolved to save on food and clothing and contribute as much as possible, resulting in the 'Shanghai Worker' airplane soaring in the skies of Shanghai today. Citizens, this is just a small contribution from our workers. We hope you will participate with even greater and more powerful forces to jointly shoulder the responsibility of saving the country. [Issued by the Shanghai General Labor Union of the Chinese Aviation Association]"</p>
<p>"Dear citizens, the Chinese Aviation Association advocates redeeming airplanes to resist insults, which is truly the essential task of saving the country today. Comrades in the education sector of this city, in addition to teaching about shame and war and striving for military training, are running around and appealing for donations to purchase warplanes and contribute them to the government. If the education sector across the country rises up from now on and cooperates in donating, then accumulating sand can form a tower, and our country will not find it difficult to form the most powerful air force in the near future. This is the significance of naming the 'Shanghai School' warplane, and it is also the fervent hope of the education sector in this city. [Issued by the Shanghai Educational Association of the Chinese Aviation Association]"</p>
<p>"Dear citizens, airplanes are essential for aerial combat. The Chinese Aviation Association, recognizing this, is making every effort to promote the expansion of the air force. All sectors of this city are enthusiastically raising aviation funds to save the country and ordering warplanes. Our fellow Ningbo sojourners in Shanghai have always had patriotic enthusiasm and have not dared to lag behind. They have raised donations to purchase warplanes and donate them to the government to fulfill their sincerity in saving the country. We deeply hope that other sojourners in Shanghai will follow suit and become advocates for various provinces and cities, so that many hands can make light work, and our country's air force will not find it difficult to become a powerful force in the near future, enough to wash away humiliation and repel enemies. [Issued by the Ningbo Sojourners Association in Shanghai of the Chinese Aviation Association]"</p>
<p>"Dear citizens, among modern self-defense weapons, airplanes are the most sharp. Therefore, striving for the 'saving the country through aviation' movement is truly urgent. The Boy Scouts of this city are eager to rush to difficulties and are determined to volunteer. Therefore, they have repeatedly mobilized to solicit donations for saving the country through aviation. Even under the scorching sun and torrential rain, they have not rested much. Today, the 'Shanghai Boy Scout' warplane appearing in the air is a manifestation of the lofty aspirations of our Boy Scouts. We earnestly hope that citizens will witness this great undertaking, recognize its sincerity, and automatically and generously contribute continuously, so that the goal of saving the country through aviation can be achieved as soon as possible. [Issued by the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Chinese Boy Scouts of China of the Chinese Aviation Association]"</p>

<p>Zhu Chuba and others, citizens of Wusong, sent a telegram yesterday on behalf of the Chinese Aviation Association to Lin Wojiang, saying, "After reading the newspaper, we are delighted to learn that your association has scheduled a naming ceremony for new aircraft on an auspicious day. At the same time, more than thirty aircraft will fly around the city's skies, a magnificent event that will enhance the public's national salvation. We have examined the events of January 28th in our Songjiang area. Because there was no air force equipment, it suffered enemy aircraft arbitrarily devastating it. The public is still regretting it. We are planning to take this opportunity to fly over the disaster areas of Zhabei, Jiangwan, and Wusong for several weeks, so that our people can see national aircraft. All the people are cheering and this will also be enough to release the feelings of being suppressed before." Signed, "Zhu Chuba, Dong Jingren, Cao Qi, and others of Wusong."</p>

<p>The local Chinese and Foreign Relief Society, considering the ravages of the typhoon disaster in Chuansha, combined with the force of the waves, especially in Hengsha, Yuansha, and other places, which are islands formed by silt in the sea and often suffer disasters during major tides, found that on September 2nd, a sudden hurricane arose, with raging waves surging like mountains, causing the embankment to collapse completely, the entire island to be submerged, and the houses to drift away, with almost no survivors. People and livestock were drowned, and the number could not be counted. This catastrophe was an unprecedented disaster. There were 2,000 affected households and nearly 10,000 victims. Now that the storm has passed, the water has not completely receded. The victims are gathered at the embankment, without shelter or stored food, crying out in hunger and cold, calling for relatives and searching for companions, their tragic state of displacement reaching the sky. In addition, the decaying bodies of people and animals have not been completely buried, and the foul odor is breeding strange diseases. If they are not urgently relieved, there will be no survivors. Such a disaster is almost inhuman. Encountering such tragedy, they are still compatriots. Therefore, the society, in conjunction with the Jisheng Society, immediately raised several thousand yuan in foreign currency and rushed to Chuansha for emergency relief. However, with over ten thousand victims, it is inevitable that it will be like a drop in the bucket. It is hoped that all sectors will hear of this extraordinary disaster and provide assistance.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Industry entered into a tungsten ore export monopoly contract with the British firm Arnhold &amp; Co. in June of this year. The standard tungsten ore was delivered on board ships at the Shanghai and Guangdong ports at only 500 yuan per ton. The tungsten miners in southern Jiangxi, working hard and not even having enough to eat, said that with the establishment of the monopoly bureau, their lives would be cut short. They petitioned for the cancellation of the original contract. The Hunan Mining Association also telegraphed the Ministry of Industry to cancel the monopoly contract and seek other appropriate relief measures.</p>

<p>Mr. Sun Reported on His Efforts to Struggle After Returning to the Country</p>
<p>In the Afternoon, He Flew in an Airplane to Pay Respects to the Songhu War Zone</p>
<p>Yesterday morning at 9 o'clock, the Municipal Party Headquarters and various organizations held a meeting at the auditorium of the Ximen Juvenile Propaganda Group to welcome Sun Tonggang, a young aviator who studied in Germany, and his classmate Wang Zuwen. Over five hundred people, including representatives from various sectors and reporters from newspapers, attended, making it a grand occasion. In the afternoon at 3:30, Sun, Wang, and Lin Wojiang boarded an airplane and flew around the city, overlooking the ruins of the Songhu War Zone and distributing promotional materials. Details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e142">Representatives in Attendance <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>The representatives who attended yesterday morning included Tong Hangbai and Jiang Huaisu from the Municipal Party Headquarters, Yu Hongjun from the Municipal Government, Zhang Xiang from the Garrison Command, Lin Wojiang from the Aviation Association, Wang Yansong from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Yu Zhenhui and Zhang Huijun from the Municipal Agricultural Association, Zhou Xuexiang and Shao Xubai from the General Labor Union, Chen Pin from the Two Roads Party Headquarters, Huang Zaoxiong from the Municipal Education Association, Tang Difang from the Land Bureau, Li Zemin from the Public Security Bureau, Zhu Yangwu from the First Special District Citizens' Association, Huang Xianggu from the Second Special District Citizens' Association, Shui Xiangyun from the Postal Workers' Union, Zhu Yaqiang from the Local Association, Chen Tongshi from the Red Cross Society, Chen Peide from the Joint Association of Various Organizations for Relief, Cen Qiyao from the Navigation Association, Zhou Shifu from the University Federation, and representatives from various agencies, organizations, schools, and party headquarters at all levels, totaling approximately over five hundred people.</p>
<h3 id="e143">Conference Staff <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>The presidium consisted of seven people: Tong Hangbai from the Municipal Party Headquarters, Yu Hongjun from the Municipal Government, Zhang Xiang from the Garrison Command, Wang Yansong from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Lin Wojiang from the Aviation Association, Yu Zhenhui from the Municipal Agricultural Association, and Zhou Xuexiang from the General Labor Union. The master of ceremonies was Fan Mingyao, the recorder was Zhu Chun and Du Mengsen, the receptionists were Huang Xianggu, Zhang Hanyun, and Cao Runshen. Eight armed policemen were dispatched by the third squadron of the police brigade to maintain order in the venue. At the same time, the Second Precinct of the Second District also increased its patrols for security. The order of the meeting was as follows: (1) Opening of the meeting, (2) Singing the Party song, (3) Paying the highest respect to the Party and national flags and the portrait of the Generalissimo, (4) The chairman respectfully reading the Generalissimo's will, (5) Silence, (6) The chairman delivering a welcoming speech, (7) Comrade Sun Tonggang reporting on his flight experience, (8) Guest speeches, (9) Shouting slogans, (10) Adjournment.</p>

<p>After the meeting opened as scheduled, Chairman Tong Hangbai delivered a welcoming speech, stating that the Municipal Party Headquarters convened this meeting to welcome Comrade Sun, and its main significance lies in several points: (1) At present, China's political, economic, and social aspects all have many urgent problems to be solved. However, the issue of national survival is the foundation of all problems. In the past, China never paid attention to national defense and air defense, so it was breached and defenseless, allowing others to control it. Recently, the four northeastern provinces have been occupied by violence, this city has also been almost completely destroyed, and the nine small islands in the South China Sea have been plundered by France, entering and exiting as if in an uninhabited place. If the nation cannot survive, what other problems can be discussed? Therefore, if we want to solve the fundamental problem of national survival, we must concentrate our strength and strengthen national defense. Modern national defense is centered on air defense, so the manufacturing of aircraft and piloting talent should be widely cultivated and can no longer be purchased from foreign countries or recruited from other places. It is very obvious that Comrade Sun was able to fly an airplane across the Eurasian continent at a time when the whole country feels that talent is difficult to find, creating the only new record in China's aviation field, attracting the attention of the Chinese people to the aviation industry and jointly promoting its development. This is the point most worthy of our welcome. (2) China's science is backward and its culture is immature, so everything is inferior to others. In the past, the Generalissimo also</p>
<h3 id="e145">Mr. Sun Hosts the Press (Photo Taken by Qichang Photography Studio) <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>He once instructed us, "What we should learn from foreign countries is science, not politics. However, if we want to learn foreign science today, we must do so with the spirit of catching up head-on, so that we will not fall behind again." The youth in the country all know this principle, so over the years, the number of students going abroad to study has been no less than tens of millions. However, once they return to China after completing their studies, they cannot use what they have learned for its intended purpose. Since learning and application are contradictory, what they have learned is equivalent to not having learned it. There are many difficult reasons, but the weakness of their own will and the pursuit of immediate benefits are also among the reasons. Now, what Comrade Sun has learned in Europe is science, not politics. After completing his studies and returning to the country, he did not take a ship or train, but instead flew the airplane he had learned to fly, further expanding the use of what he had learned. Therefore, he has the grand undertaking of flying throughout the country to promote aviation. This point of "applying what has been learned" is enough to correct the bad habit of learning and application not matching, and this honor of flying back to the country can further encourage the rising youth to know that in addition to eating, taking an official position, there are also careers that can increase their status and develop their honor, so that they will not become bored and frustrated without a way out.</p>
<h3 id="e146">Reporting on the Experience <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>Then, Mr. Sun Tonggang reported on his experience, stating, "In 1928, I was sent to Germany by the central government to study aviation. After arriving in Germany from Shanghai, I studied German for half a year and then entered the Junkers and Siemens aircraft factories to work. Later, I entered a primary aviation school and gradually moved up to university. At university, I had a good grasp of piloting skills, so I bought today's airplane for practice. Since the September 18th Incident and the January 28th Incident, I have been deeply stimulated and have worked even harder, knowing that in today's international situation, without a strong air force, it is impossible to enter the ranks of the strong. Among China's 400 million compatriots, no foreigner has ever known that there are Chinese aviators. Considering this, I had the long-distance return journey to the country. The tail of the plane was painted with the Party and national emblem, which suffered many setbacks. Later, after repeated negotiations with the German government, permission was finally obtained. My classmate, Mr. Li, saw my enthusiasm and wrote the Generalissimo's instruction 'Saving the country through aviation' on the plane, which made it even more noticeable. Since taking off from Germany on June 26th of this year until arriving in Guangdong, the most painful and difficult things in the process were, first, there was no equipment for weather testing along the way; second, there was a lot of rain in June, July, and August in the area. I was concerned that the airplane, which was made of very small pieces of wood glued together, would have pieces falling off once it rained; third, I had to fly at least eight hours a day, and sometimes eleven hours. After stopping, I had to add fuel, water, and repair parts, so I only had five hours of sleep each day, which made me feel very tired. Fourth, money could not be exchanged in various places. Every time I arrived at a place, I had to go to the bank to withdraw money. But although I felt all kinds of difficulties, I was eventually overwhelmed by the enthusiasm for saving the country through aviation and resolutely set off. At that time, I passed through the Balkans from Germany, through the desert areas around the Mediterranean Sea, where the flying sand was as high as 2,000 meters. When the wind rose, all directions were vast and dangerous, which was the most dangerous part of the flight. After passing through Arabia, Persia, Siam, Annam, India, and other places, I was isolated due to language barriers or detained by military authorities, which taught me a lot. But in the end, in a difficult environment, I was fortunate to have the spirit of the Generalissimo in heaven, and I was able to return to my motherland. This is a fortunate event." Then, Wang Zuwen reported (omitted).</p>
<h3 id="e147">Guest Speeches <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>Afterwards, Lin Wojiang gave an impassioned speech, saying, "Mr. Sun's return to the country from Europe, its danger and hardship, has been heard from Mr. Sun. Fortunately, Mr. Sun worked hard and advanced before returning safely to the motherland. This deserves our 120 points of joy. Tomorrow (the 9th), a naming ceremony for five aircraft will be held in this city. In addition to welcoming the aircraft, we also want to welcome aviation talents, because Mr. Sun will also go to the aircraft field tomorrow, and I will also keep Mr. Sun in Shanghai for a few more days to awaken the attention of people in this city to aviation. In the 20th century, a country without an air force can be said to be unadapted to the environment. A country that is not adapted to the environment, if it wants to survive in the world, its future is dangerous, to say the least. Aviation is extremely important to military affairs, that is, to transportation, and it also occupies a major application position. We hope that the nation will survive in the world, and aviation must be developed. Please pay special attention to it." After the speech, slogans were shouted and the meeting was adjourned.</p>
<h3 id="e148">Flying Around the City <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>Around 3 o'clock in the afternoon, Sun Tonggang, Wang Zuwen, and Lin Wojiang, the secretary-general of the Aviation Association, went to Hongqiao Airport in the same car. At 3:30, they boarded the aviation aircraft saving the nation and flew around the city in the urban area for a week and distributed propaganda. Then, they flew north to Jiangwan and Wusong, overlooking the ruins of the January 28th War Zone. At 4:30, they returned to Hongqiao, circled the field several times, and landed safely. After getting off the plane, Mr. Sun told a Central News Agency reporter that this trip was only one hour. The flight around Wusong was very low, from fifty meters to thirty, twenty, meters, and even skimmed the ground. Therefore, the destroyed fort was very clear to observe. When the reporter asked if he had any thoughts, he replied that he was deeply touched and could not express it in a few words. Last night at 7 o'clock, Mr. Sun entertained the city's press at the Atlantic Restaurant, and over one hundred and fifty people attended. Mr. Sun personally and diligently hosted the event. Around 10 o'clock, the hosts and guests happily dispersed.</p>

<p>Sichuan Fellow Townsmen and Petition Group Yesterday Hosted the Press</p>
<p>The Committee for Relieving the Red Disaster in Western Sichuan of the Sichuan Sojourners Association in Shanghai and the Sichuan Northwestern Red Disaster Petition Group hosted the local press at 3:00 PM yesterday on the ninth floor of the YMCA at the Eight Immortals Bridge, reporting on the situation of the Red bandits harming Sichuan. Over twenty newspaper reporters attended. The various details are recorded below.</p>
<h3 id="e150">Chairman's Report <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>First, Chairman Li Fan briefly gave a welcoming speech. Then, Qiu Zhizhong reported on the significance of hosting the reporters, stating that the Red bandits in Sichuan occupied over 3,000 districts in more than ten places in northern Sichuan, including Tongjiang, Nanjiang, Bazhong, and Guangyuan. The number of people fleeing from these ten-plus counties to the east and west of Sichuan has reached over two million. For details, please ask the representatives of the group to report. I will not elaborate. However, after this serious incident, the telegram will detail the requests to the Executive Yuan of the government and the Disaster Relief Association, requesting them to quickly allocate large sums of money for emergency relief. Letters have also been sent to various charitable organizations and philanthropists in this city. In the two weeks since then, in addition to a batch of documents from the Disaster Relief Association, the government has not yet replied. We feel that the Red Disaster in Sichuan is no less than the floods. If the two million-plus victims are not rescued, those who dare to take risks out of hunger and cold are not a few. If the bandits fully absorb these two million-plus victims, the bandit trouble will expand even more. According to the report of the Military Affairs Commission, there are no more than 300,000 Red bandits. However, the government is spending tens of millions of troops, spending several years of effort, and spending hundreds of millions of money, and has not yet completely cleared them. If the refugees in the Red areas of northern Sichuan are not rescued, and seven times more are added to the Red Army's power, the future of the nation and the nation can be imagined. Moreover, when Chongqing, the capital of our province, suffered from the floods of the Yangtze River in the year of the Republic of China, Shanghai assisted, raising a total of 40,000 yuan for assistance. It can be imagined that the hearts of the benevolent have no distinction. Now, in addition to seeking help from the government based on the above-mentioned report, we also plan to invite fellow countrymen from Beijing and Shanghai, invite charitable organizations and philanthropists in this city, and beg for great compassion to help those victims, and to report on the needs of the press, for the mouthpieces of the people and the teachers of society. Please call on the world to ask for orders for more than two million refugees, so that they will not be forced to become bandits. Not only will our Association be grateful, but the rebirth of the victims will also be grateful in the future. Secondly, Liu Zizhong, the representative of the Petition Group, reported in detail on the Red Disaster and the victims' eager desire for rescue. His report on the process of the Red bandits harming Sichuan and the displacement of the victims is as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e151">The Course of the Red Disaster <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>It was found that the Xu and Kuang divisions had already been defeated by the central government's pursuit last winter, and only 7,000 or 8,000 bandits remained, entrenched in the border of Sichuan and Shaanxi. They were very short of bullets and had no fighting ability. By chance, the Sichuan army was in a civil war, and Liu Wenhui and Tian Leiyao were fighting in the province, resulting in an empty rear. Tongnanba, located on the border between Sichuan and Shaanxi, was taken advantage of by the Communist bandits and fell into the hands of the bandits. At this time, the troops stationed in Tongnanba and Baoning were from the third division of Luo Bochang. Luo was a soldier from the ranks, and he was extremely arrogant and domineering. He did everything he could to oppress the people. Before the Red bandits fell into Tongnanba last winter, he had levied more than 700,000 alcohol taxes in three months, all of which went into his private pockets. When the Red bandits came, he did not resist at all and abandoned the city and fled. This is why the Red bandits successively captured three counties. After the Red bandits captured the three counties of Tongnanba, they looted them extensively, and all the original social order was destroyed. As a result, more than 100,000 people were displaced. This was the first fall. On the social side, there was considerable strength to provide relief to these displaced refugees. In May of this year, Liu Wenhui, the chairman of Sichuan Province, attacked the Deng army, ignoring the national crisis. Tian and Deng depended on each other, and they withdrew the troops to assist Deng. The Xu and Kuang bandits, who had already been defeated, took the opportunity to counterattack and recapture the three counties of Tongnanba. Recently, a letter from Sichuan stated that the strength of the Red bandits had increased three or four times, and the area they occupied was also larger than before. In counties such as Yilong and Cangxi, more than two-thirds of the villages outside the county area were occupied by the Communist bandits. Moreover, it is close to the autumn harvest, and the Communist bandits are looting everywhere, and they are stockpiling the looted food in Cangba Changchi Enyang River, etc., with a long-term plan. On the one hand, the Soviet People's Bank was reorganized in Tongjiang, and the Sichuan-Shaanxi Provincial Soviet Government was established in Bazhong, showing that the Communist bandits were really Red in both Sichuan and Shaanxi.</p>
<h3 id="e152">Victims Displaced <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>It was found that Tongnanba was first trapped, and it was the end of the old lunar calendar, and the people's homes still had a little storage, so Dada could barely escape. Moreover, at that time, the area occupied by the Communist bandits was small, and the impact was not great, so the number of displaced people was only 100,000. The second trapping, the slaughter of the Communist bandits was even more tragic than before. The people were afraid of being killed and fled their homes one after another. The people of the three counties of Tongnanba fled to Guqing, Jianzhong, Yilong, Nanbu, Yingshan, Daxian, Quxian, and Xuanhan. In the northwest counties of Wen, there were no places without victims. The tragic displacement was beyond words. At this time, the victims in various places are mostly 100 people living in one place, steamed by heat, suffering from hunger and disease, and those who died from infectious diseases cannot be counted, and even those who died in the whole family can be described as the most tragic things in the world.</p>
<h3 id="e153">Purpose of the Petition <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>The people of the northwestern counties of Sichuan are now in a dire situation. Those who have already fallen into the counties are suffering unspeakable pain, while those who have not fallen into the counties are raising a class of corrupt local ruffians, who are mostly willing to be the claws of warlords, causing the people to have no way out and no way to live. The reason for this is that the Red bandits entrenched on the border between northern Sichuan must first be wiped out. Therefore, (1) Please clear the Red bandits of the central government, and (2) Please relieve the victims of the central government.</p>
<h3 id="e154">Wang Delin's Unit Reports Recapturing Dongning <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>Captured 150 enemy trucks</p>
<p>A lot of machine guns and rifles were seized and countless enemies were killed</p>
<p>Zhang Yuting, the commander of the former National Salvation Army, Wang Delin, sent Liang Huayao, a representative, to Shanghai yesterday to visit Wang and Kong, the two commanders and deputy commanders, and reported on the recapturing of Dongning. Mr. Liang set off from Dongning on the 30th of last month and arrived in Shanghai yesterday. Wang and Kong happened to be returning from Guangdong and were on the way, so they went to Zhang Chuyu, the representative of the army stationed in Shanghai, to report everything. The report is excerpted as follows: (Omitted above) Hua Yao was ordered by Zhang Yuting, the commander of the National Salvation Army, on August 19, to enter the customs and pay tribute to Commander Wang and Deputy Commander Kong, report everything, and call for relief, urging the two commanders to return to the defense and preside over the attack and recapture of lost territory at this time of the Qing gauze curtain. At that time, Zhang Bi, the commander of the battle, secretly ordered the various departments to attack Dongning by the end of the period. The order remained for a few days to wait for the success of the war and report together. On the 25th of the month, the various troops of our army gathered and attacked Dongning, taking a surrounded style. Because the Xishan Fort of the place was very dangerous, there were thousands of enemy troops stationed there. Commander Zhang personally led the brigade commander Li Zhaodong to serve on the west side, and brigade commander Shan De and brigade commander Zhang Qixiang served on the east and north sides, fighting for four hours, and captured the Xishan fort. The enemy's momentum was not supported, and they retreated to the Beikou Lugou in Dongning. They took advantage of the victory and won, and on the same day, when the enemy troops retreated to Wanlugou, they were attacked by Zhang's Xu Zhili Brigade. The enemy collapsed into an army and scattered and discarded their weapons. It was estimated that more than 150 enemy trucks, two machine guns, 48 rifles, and countless enemies were seized in the battle. The order in Dongning has been restored. After resting, we will push forward again.</p>

<h3 id="e155">The 20,000-Mile Long-Distance Propaganda Experience of the National Disaster Propaganda Group of the United States <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>Through Eleven Provinces Including Jiangsu, Hubei, Hunan, Hebei, Shanxi, Chahar, and Suiyuan</p>
<p>Brought Back a Large Number of Items to be Exhibited in Beijing and Shanghai</p>
<p>And Plans for a Second Long-Distance National Disaster Propaganda</p>
<p>The National Disaster Propaganda Group of Students from Shanghai Art College, with the support of the central government, set off from Beijing in January of this year, and spent seven months in the Yangtze River, North China, and the Mongolian border, carrying out national disaster propaganda, traveling 20,000 miles. After the first phase of propaganda work was completed, it returned to Shanghai on the 5th of this month. A reporter from Shanghai Social News Agency specially visited Mr. Shen Yiqian, the head of the group, yesterday to discuss the propaganda experience and future plans as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e156">Origin of Departure <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Shen said that since the loss of Shenyang on September 18, he recognized that this was the beginning of the country's peril. Therefore, he was determined to perish in the Northeast</p>

<p>Advocating the principle of "saving China by saving the Northeast, which is saving ourselves," he gathered seven like-minded comrades to form a National Crisis Propaganda Group. Initially, they engaged in propaganda in Shanghai, creating propaganda posters and sending them to Canada, the Philippines, the South Seas Islands, the the United States, and other places to attract global attention. During the January 28th Shanghai Incident, the group engaged in frontline propaganda. After the war, feeling the lack of protection in the airspace, they also promoted national salvation through aviation on behalf of the China Aviation Association. Since the loss of Yuguan and the instability of North China, lamenting the imminent fall of the nation, they immediately packed up a few painting tools and resolutely set out for various provinces to conduct long-distance propaganda. On one hand, they exposed the enemy's conspiracies and atrocities, and on the other hand, they inspired the people to raise funds for self-salvation in order to rescue the endangered China.</p>
<h3 id="e158">The Propaganda Journey <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Shen then stated, "Our group departed from Shanghai at the end of January this year for Beijing, a total of seven people. After arriving in Beijing, we immediately held a National Crisis Painting Exhibition at the Confucius Temple. More than 50,000 people visited, including central figures such as Chairman Lin. Subsequently, with the support of the central government, we traveled upstream along the Yangtze River in mid-February, stopping at Hankou. After about two weeks of propaganda, we crossed the river to Wuchang, where we held a National Crisis Painting Exhibition at the Provincial Public Education Hall, adding lantern slides and posting front-line pictorials. At the same time, at the request of various circles in Wuhan, we specially painted multiple "Aviation Saves the Nation" pictures for widespread promotion, creating a very tense atmosphere. In early March, we transferred to Changsha. The number of people who received our group's propaganda was over 100,000, and the public spirit was high, leaving the best impression. At that time, there were five people traveling together. Due to academic commitments, they returned to Shanghai. However, considering the deepening war in North China, I resolutely went north on April 7 to participate in the war zone propaganda. I also held a National Crisis Painting Exhibition in the Central Park of Beiping, where there were direct conflicts with the Japanese. The public spirit of my hometown was greatly inspired. After the Tanggu Truce was signed, I immediately...</p>

<p>I conducted propaganda in the Chahar area and was once detained by troops under Feng Yuxiang's command. At the end of May, I left Zhangjiakou and traveled on foot to Suiyuan and Liaoning, holding a National Exhibition at the Mongolian Temple in Jinlitu Tai. I also distributed a large number of promotional booklets and color pictorials, all with explanations in Mongolian, to approach the Mongolian people. Old and young alike came to visit, and they were deeply moved. At the end of June, I went to Baotou to focus on Mongolian and Hui propaganda. Then I went to Ulanqab League in northern Suiyuan to visit the life of the Mongolian people. Alone in the northern wilderness, I was surrounded by bandits in the mountains about a hundred miles from Baotou and was almost killed, barely escaping with my life. The second time, I repacked my belongings in Baotou and once again went to Inner Mongolia, heading to Wudang Tai, the largest and most famous temple inside and outside Yinshan Mountain, to conduct interviews. The executive officers treated me as a distinguished guest and presented me with a Mongolian dog. After four days of collecting information, I conducted a concrete investigation of Mongolian education, folk life, and nomadic conditions, and took more than a hundred photographs and dozens of sketches. At the end of July, I returned to Baotou and collected more than a hundred kinds of woolen textiles from the Northwest. Then I took the Beiping-Pukou Railway back to Beijing to make a report to the central government. On the fifth of this month, I rushed back to Shanghai. In total, this trip lasted seven months, passing through eleven provinces, with a journey of about 20,000 li."</p>
<h3 id="e160">Future Plans <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>Future plans: (1) Preparing for a North China Sketch Exhibition, with locations set in Nanjing and Shanghai. It is currently in preparation. (2) Establishing a Northwest Native Products Purchasing and Sales Office. (3) Planning a second long-distance propaganda trip, determined to traverse about fifteen provinces in the northwest, southwest, and southeast, a journey of 35,000 li. The purposes are: 1. Anti-Japanese national salvation propaganda. 2. Exchanging feelings among various ethnic groups. 3. Uniting the national spirit. 4. Investigating the border situation. 5. Compiling the results into a systematic book for the reference of the people of the country.</p>

<p>Finally, Mr. Shen told the reporter that he will lead the group members, carrying a large number of collected materials and various sketches and photos, to Beijing by express train this afternoon. Last week, we held a North China Sketch Exhibition at the Confucius Temple and prepared the procedures for the group's second long-distance propaganda work. We will return to Shanghai in about two weeks. After returning to Shanghai, we will hold a sketch exhibition in this city, and at the latest around Double Tenth Day, we will start our second long-distance propaganda trip to the north.</p>
<h3 id="e163">A Strange Iron Box Suddenly Appears in West Yaojia Lane <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>A Huge Hole Chiseled in the Bottom of the Box</p>
<p>No One Claims It</p>
<p>Related to the China Land Reclamation Bank's Missing Money Case: The China Land Reclamation Bank recently shipped 70,000 yuan of silver dollars from its Ningbo branch to Shanghai, entrusting it to Wei Yuming, a steward on the New Ning-Shao steamer of the Ning-Shao Company. Unexpectedly, upon arrival in Shanghai, a huge hole was suddenly discovered in the bottom of the iron box containing the money, and the 70,000 yuan of silver dollars inside had been stolen, leaving only 210 yuan. At the time, Tang, who shared the room and was on the run, was suspected of being heavily involved. The bank sent letters to the British and French concessions and the Water Police Bureau requesting his arrest, and formally posted a reward notice. However, as of this morning, the escaped Tang and the lost 69,790 yuan of silver dollars have not been recovered. However, around 7 p.m. the night before, an ownerless iron box was suddenly discovered on the roadside at the entrance of West Yaojia Lane in the city. The box was about two feet long, more than a foot wide, and the height and style were the same as the iron boxes used exclusively by banks to transport money. The strangest thing was that the bottom of this box, like the bottom of the iron box containing the missing money from the China Land Reclamation Bank, had a huge hole chiseled by thieves using iron tools. However, the box was empty. It was discovered by police officer Han Tinghu in charge of that area. After waiting for a long time, the owner still did not come to claim it. Therefore, the box was taken to the Second Precinct of the First District, where Director Liu inspected it. Because the box arrived so strangely, it was deemed to be related to the China Land Reclamation Bank's missing money case. At around noon yesterday, he ordered his subordinates to prepare a document and send the box to the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau for filing. At the same time, a senior police officer was dispatched to investigate the origin of the box.</p>
<h3 id="e164">Customs Seizes a Huge Smuggling Case of Military Supplies <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>A Total of Thirty-Nine Latest Model Automatic Pistols</p>
<p>Thirty-Six Magazine Clips and Four Thousand Bullets</p>
<p>According to the Shanghai Times, it has been learned that customs officials cracked a major case of smuggling a large amount of military supplies on Wednesday night and arrested several suspects. The military supplies included a total of thirty-nine pistols, mostly the latest model automatic pistols, thirty-six magazine clips, and four thousand bullets. They were found on the Glenogle, a ship of the Chata Company that sailed from the United Kingdom and various ports in Europe. When the ship arrived at the port at 5 p.m. on Wednesday afternoon, customs officers boarded the ship for inspection as usual. They then found the military supplies in the drawers of an empty cabin occupied by the engineer. At that time, it was suspected that a Chinese servant in the engine room was involved in the smuggling. Therefore, they paid close attention that night and arrested several suspected Chinese in the early morning. The investigation is still ongoing. According to reports, it is common for customs to seize smuggled military supplies, but usually only three or four items. Such a large-scale smuggling case is rare.</p>
<h3 id="e165">Japanese Vice-Consul Requests the Extradition of Chinese National Jin Shuishan <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>Why is Japan Concerned About the Murder of an American Citizen by a Chinese National?</p>
<p>Jin Shuishan, a Korean who has become a Chinese national, is now 23 years old. He had previously studied at a certain military academy. His ancestors were originally Korean, but his father and others had become Chinese citizens since childhood. Therefore, Shuishan had long become a pure Chinese. During the January 28th Incident, Jin joined a certain artillery battalion and killed countless enemies, making many meritorious achievements. Therefore, he was hated by the enemy to the bone. They repeatedly sent people to secretly investigate and arrest him, and devised plans to harm him. However, because Jin was extremely vigilant on weekdays, they could not find an opportunity to strike. After the Shanghai War ended and the agreement was signed, Jin was re-hired by the Central Artillery School as a training officer, working hard in teaching and sparing no effort. Recently, due to important matters, he planned to go to Guangdong. Therefore, he came to Shanghai a few days ago and boarded the Yi Sun steamer to set off. However, because the ship had not reached the departure date, it had not yet set anchor as of yesterday, so it was still berthed next to the Sixteenth Pier of the South City. Unexpectedly, Jin's whereabouts were suddenly known by treacherous people, who secretly reported to the Japanese Consulate, falsely accusing him of assassinating Liu Yinfa, a Korean who had become an American citizen. At around 2 p.m. yesterday afternoon, Vice-Consul Saeki Tasuke reported to the Third Precinct of the Fifth District of the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau, requesting assistance in the arrest. The Director of the precinct, Wen Yishan, knowing that the Huangpu River was under the jurisdiction of the Water Patrol Team and that the precinct lacked personnel proficient in Japanese, sent Li Jiachi, a clerk from the First Precinct of the Fifth District, to accompany the Japanese Vice-Consul to the South City Water Patrol Headquarters. Commander Zhu dispatched several senior police officers to board a patrol boat and rush to the surface of the Huangpu River at the Sixteenth Pier. They boarded the Yi Sun steamer and arrested Jin Shuishan, bringing him back to the team. After a brief interrogation by Commander Zhu, he was handed over to Clerk Li and brought back to the Third Precinct of the Fifth District. At that time, the Japanese Vice-Consul immediately requested permission to extradite Jin back to the consulate for interrogation. However, Director Wen did not approve the extradition because the Japanese Consulate claimed that Jin was the murderer who assassinated Liu Yinfa, but did not provide any substantial evidence. He will send personnel to conduct a detailed investigation and then submit a report to Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau Chief Wen Hongen for approval before proceeding.</p>

<p>Shot in the Chest, She Dies on the Spot</p>
<p>Yang Bingfa, a native of Ningbo, 60 years old, lived at No. 21 Yong'an Lane, Zhoushan Road, Zhoujiazui Road. He was a foreman in the engine room of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Tonghua steamer and had some assets. His wife, Chen, was 47 years old. They had only one son, Rui, 26 years old, who worked as a coppersmith at the Asia Petroleum Company. Last night, after dinner, Rui was at home playing a game of bamboo with friends. Around 12 o'clock, they suddenly heard someone outside the door shouting "Selling ham!" Everyone was hungry and opened the door. At that moment, three thieves took the opportunity to enter. One of them took out a pistol and searched the gamblers and Chen's entire body. As a result, they stole more than ten silver dollars, nine watches, and one gold ring. The thieves carried the loot and left. However, when Rui's mother, Chen, saw the thieves leaving, she turned around to close the door. Unexpectedly, the thieves suspected that she was going out to call for help. One of the thieves immediately fired a shot, hitting her in the chest. The bullet did not penetrate, and she collapsed to the ground, bleeding profusely. She died on the spot. Seeing the tragedy, the thieves fled. Later, the family called the police, who sent the body to Tongren Hospital for examination.</p>

<h3 id="e168">Rabid Dog Kills Person in Gaochang Temple, Health Bureau Announces Emergency Treatment Methods <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>A rabid dog has been found in the Zhuhu Road area of Gaochang Temple, and several children have been bitten. One 16-year-old boy has died of poisoning. The rabid dog has also been killed by people. However, there are many stray dogs in the area, and there are still many dogs that appear to be rabid. Nearby citizens are afraid to approach. The Shanghai Tongshan Xizi Association in the area specially petitioned the Municipal Health Bureau for relief. After receiving the report, the bureau immediately sent personnel to investigate. Yesterday, Dr. Zhang Bingrui of the Health Education Division of the bureau published methods for preventing rabid dog bites to the Shen Shi News reporter. According to Dr. Zhang, the toxicity of rabid dog bites usually develops within 14 to 40 days. Therefore, treatment should be sought quickly during this period. Once the toxicity has developed, there is little hope of recovery. There are two emergency treatment methods: (1) Treatment of the wound: Strong nitric acid can be used to cauterize the wound, or fire can be used for cauterization. (2) Pasteur rabies treatment: you can go to a hospital, or the Public Works Bureau and the Health Bureau, etc., to inject a special vaccine to resist the rabies virus. The fundamental method is to control rabid dogs. The Health Bureau is actively working on this, and it is hoped that citizens will also pay attention.</p>

<p>Established the Nanyang Langge Timber Firm Worker Introduction Agency</p>
<p>Recruited Workers Everywhere, Each Person Had to Pay a Huge Deposit</p>
<p>丨Thirty-Six People Appeared in Court Yesterday to Testify丨</p>
<p>Zhou Lichun, a native of Yangzhou, 46 years old, was a doctor. Recently, due to the lack of patients, his nephew Zhou Jincai, who had previously worked at the American Langge Foreign Firm at No. 1 Huangpu Road, was sent to the Langge Timber Firm in Pulo Ro, Nanyang Islands. After resigning this spring, he lived idly with his uncle Zhou Lichun at No. 18 Songmao Lane, Songpan Road, Yangshupu. The two uncles and nephews recently came up with a fraudulent scheme, falsely claiming that the branch of the foreign firm, the Nanyang Langge Timber Firm, wanted to hire a large number of workers who could earn a monthly salary of 50 or 60 yuan. They established an introduction agency at their residence, printed cards, with Zhou Jincai as the chief foreman, and invited several assistants to recruit workers everywhere, each person having to pay a deposit of 20 or 30 yuan. From January to this month, 150 people were deceived. On the 31st of last month, the case was solved by Chinese Detective Liu Wenzao and Detectives Guo Jingbang and No. 2568 of the Yangshupu Police Station. Zhou Lichun, Zhou Jincai, and their accomplices Zhou Jinbao, Fei Zhaofeng, Xu Hechun, Wei Fu, Jin Yushan, Lv Zhenmao, Wang Dewu, Du Honglong, Zhou Lisen, and other eleven people were arrested one after another, along with recruitment cards, name books, fake seals, and a large bundle of letters from the victims asking when they would depart. They were taken to the police station the next morning and sent to the simple court of the First Special District for investigation. Now that the case should be heard by the local court, the police station sent it to the Criminal Third Court yesterday morning. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin first described the case, saying that at around 10 a.m. this morning, twenty-six victims were making a fuss at the door of the introduction agency established by the two Zhous. Police officers asked what was the matter. They claimed that they had been recruited by the introduction agency to work at the Nanyang Langge Timber Firm, and had paid the deposit for many months, but the agency had not fulfilled its promise to send them to work. The detectives knew it was a fraudulent organization and arrested the defendants. During the subsequent investigation, it was found that Zhou Lichun was in charge of the accounting, Zhou Jincai was responsible for going out to recruit workers and collect money, and the others were assistants. According to Zhou Jincai, in May of this year, he met a Turkish man named Iman Mateng, who was an employee of the Langge Foreign Firm. He asked him to recruit workers to go to Nanyang to work and to provide a guarantee letter. Later, he entrusted a Westerner named Luo Sibo, who was an inspector at the Nanyang Langge Timber Firm, to write a letter of introduction. The letter was handed to him at the entrance of the Langge Foreign Firm at No. 1 Huangpu Road, and he recruited workers on his behalf. The first deposit was 120 yuan, and the second time it was 270 yuan. All were paid to Iman at the entrance of the foreign firm. It was found that Iman had previously worked in the Langge warehouse on Huade Road. On April 2 of this year, he embezzled 1,000 yuan and fled without a trace. The police arrested him, but have not yet caught him. Iman has a brother who works at the British American Tobacco Company, and his girlfriend lives at No. 937 North Sichuan Road. His boyfriend is named Lai Baier and lives at No. 72 on the same road. The police have repeatedly inquired at these three locations, but all said they have not seen Iman in Shanghai recently. Therefore, Zhou Jincai's confession is also unreliable. Zhou Lichun claimed that the matter was entirely done by his nephew Jincai and that he did not know the details. The others were evasive. It was found that the total amount of fraud was about 700 yuan. The total number of workers recruited was 250, and it has been found that 150 people were deceived. Today, thirty-six victims appeared in court, and the others could not be summoned. The case is requested to be postponed, and all the evidence will be presented for inspection. Subsequently, victims Lu Qingming, He Wenli, and others testified to the fraud. Judge Liu Yugui ordered the defendants to be remanded and adjourned the hearing.</p>

<p>To be held on the 15th outside Woosung</p>
<p>Another Demonstration of Militaristic Country's Power</p>
<p>After the Japanese Navy held grand maneuvers, its fleets stationed abroad also held grand reviews. The First Foreign Squadron stationed in the Yangtze River, since the Japanese Naval Ministry added the Third Fleet to Shanghai, in addition to the 24th and 27th Destroyer Squadrons and the cruiser Tenryu stationed in Shanghai, the 14 warships of the First Foreign Squadron in the Yangtze River, managed by Rear Admiral Sakamoto, are also under the command of Vice Admiral Minei, commander of the Second Fleet stationed in Shanghai. The Japanese Naval Ministry has already sent a report to Shanghai stating that the Third Fleet's warships will hold a grand exercise outside Woosung on the 15th of this month. In addition to all the ships stationed in Shanghai participating in the gathering, the warships of the First Foreign Squadron stationed in various ports along the upper and lower reaches of the Yangtze River will also be ordered by Vice Admiral Minei to be transferred to Shanghai by Commander Sakamoto to join the exercise. All Japanese ships in the Yangtze River must come east to Shanghai by the 13th of this month and must all arrive by the 14th at the latest. According to statistics, the Japanese Navy in the Yangtze River and Shanghai, under the jurisdiction of the Third Fleet, has a total of 23 ships, plus 2,200 marines. There are also  hundreds of military personnel. Among the marines, there are artillery teams, machine gun teams, tank teams, and newly formed hygiene teams, etc. A large number of military engineering teams transferred from Sasebo by the Naval Ministry last month are still actively working in the new military camp in Shanghai, building various special equipment for military purposes. In addition, since January 28th, seven or eight hundred police officers have been successively transferred from police departments across Japan to Shanghai to be trained in what is known as a "mobile police force" that is familiar with the situation in the Chinese interior, with a profound purpose.</p>
<p>The Continental News reported that in recent weeks, foreign military and diplomatic officials in this port seem to be showing signs of anxiety and uneasiness. According to a foreign consul in this port who told a reporter from the Continental News yesterday, this phenomenon is due to the completion of the huge military barracks built by the Japanese at the end of North Sichuan Road, which is about to hold a completion ceremony. The foreign consuls and officers whom the reporter met, although unwilling to reveal their names, all had a feeling that in the past ten months, the Japanese army has been working day and night to build a four-story  huge barracks that is 525 feet long and 225 feet wide, and its importance is probably not just for stationing troops. Many foreign military leaders in this port call this military camp practically a fortress. The Japanese are obviously intending to make this militarily important location  a well-equipped stronghold. According to Tokyo newspapers last week, more than 2,000 Japanese naval personnel have already moved into it. A reporter from a local newspaper witnessed a large number of munitions being transported into the camp on the 27th of last month, and armed sentries were tightly guarding all gates. In addition, Chinese and foreign officials in this port also learned from Tokyo newspapers that the Japanese Navy has chosen to hold maneuvers near Woosung on September 15th, and at the same time hold a grand completion ceremony for this military camp. Japanese warships stationed in Hankou, Wuhu, Changsha, and other places have been ordered by the Japanese Naval Ministry to go to Woosung for maneuvers, and it is also heard that several senior naval officers will come to Shanghai for inspection. Those concerned about this matter also pointed to the military hospital next to the military camp. It is said that the hospital has four stories, with a facade  almost half the size of the entire camp. Japanese newspapers estimate that the cost of building the military camp and the hospital should be more than 2 million yen, which shows the depth of their intentions. Although the construction of this huge building only started ten months ago, it was able to be completed on schedule. According to foreign officers in Shanghai, the structure of the camp is almost entirely modeled after the infantry camp of the 3rd Division of the Tokyo Kiniki, so it can be completed quickly within this short period. The hospital and the military camp are built with steel and concrete, which can withstand fierce artillery fire. The top of the camp can be equipped with 5-inch guns, and firing will not damage the camp building, which is so strong. According to military experts, the  windows of the North Sichuan Road camp are cleverly designed to place machine guns to fire in three directions. All doors in the camp are fitted with all-steel doors. The interior of the camp can accommodate 2,000 to  600 people for exercises. There is also a Chan temple for soldiers to worship. The camp also has small rooms for placing armored vehicles and tanks, and warehouses for storing large quantities of ammunition. It is said that electricity and water can be supplied from a certain place in Zhabei. The Japanese built this camp, and others paid little attention to it at first. After it was built, it was so large and strong that once a war breaks out, it can be used as a base regardless of whether it is for defense or offense. Therefore, it is not yet known whether various countries will protest or send more troops to Shanghai. However, according to foreign military experts, building a barracks resembling a fortress on Chinese soil violates the 1922 Washington Treaty. The treaty was signed by the United States, Belgium, Britain, France, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, and other countries, stipulating that foreign troops should be withdrawn immediately unless permitted by the treaty. Japan also ratified this treaty. After the Washington Conference ended, Japan withdrew its troops from Hankou and Shandong in accordance with the treaty. The number of troops stationed by the old allied countries in the north was only as stipulated in the Boxer Protocol. Troops could not be sent ashore again except in extremely urgent circumstances. After foreign troops landed in Tianjin, Hankou, Shanghai, and other places in 1927, they were withdrawn soon after. Only Shanghai has not been completely withdrawn, but the foreign troops stationed there are only temporarily stationed. Therefore, their military camps are rented or built with wood. As soon as the Chinese government can fully protect foreign nationals, they can be completely withdrawn. Since last year, they have been withdrawing successively. Currently, the foreign troops stationed in Shanghai include 2,000 American troops, 2,100 British troops, 1,400 French troops, 2,000 Japanese troops, and 1,100 members of the International Settlement Volunteer Corps.</p>
<h3 id="e175">Silk Mill Workers Resumed Work Yesterday Morning, but Struck Again in the Afternoon Due to Misunderstanding <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>Sixteen Companies Including Yuanxing All Suspended Again</p>
<p>Factories in the Settlement Did Not Operate Yesterday Due to Machine Repairs</p>
<p>According to the Ta Kung She, female workers in silk mills in the Zhabei district went on strike due to opposition to the production quota system. After mediation by the Social Affairs Bureau, it was announced that work would resume. Unexpectedly, work resumed twice and then went on strike again, and the strike also spread to five factories in the Settlement, including Yuyuan. Yesterday morning, the silk mills in the Zhabei district started work as usual, and all the workers entered the factories. Unexpectedly, in the afternoon, the workers of Yuanxing Factory on Yutong Road in Zhabei went on strike again due to a misunderstanding, and all factories immediately stopped work. The situation is very complicated. It is hoped that work will resume fully this morning. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e176">Work Resumed Yesterday Morning <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>At 5:30 yesterday morning, the 21 silk mills on Changan Road, Yutong Road, Guangfu Road, and Xinzhabei Meiyuan Road in Zhabei, including Chuxin, Hongchun, and Yuanxing, started work as usual. All the female workers in the factories entered the factories one after another. The Silk Workers' Union of the Sixth District, fearing that changes would occur again, specially sent all the directors and supervisors, Yang Geng, Wu Suzhen, Yuan Yunlong, and Li Tonggai, etc., to persuade them separately. Dozens of police officers from the Police Brigade and the Public Security Bureaus of the Fourth and Second Districts were also dispatched to the factories to protect the workers. Hongchun Silk Factory on Guangfu Road planned to release the female workers because there were not enough workers. The union, fearing that it would cause another misunderstanding, immediately consulted with the factory and temporarily maintained the start of work, so the order was good and no incident occurred.</p>
<h3 id="e177">Trouble Started Again <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>Unexpectedly, at 1:00 p.m. after lunch, when work was about to start, a piece of paper for donating to the Taiping Gongjiao was posted at the gate of Yuanxing Silk Factory on Yutong Road, with donations ranging from two to three corners. Unexpectedly, the female workers of the factory mistakenly thought that the factory had announced the production quota system, and there was a lot of noise for a while, and they unanimously refused to enter the factory. They also went to various factories such as Wuxing  Lun on Meiyuan Road to spread rumors, and the order became chaotic again. Therefore, the 15 silk mills on Changan Road, including Chuxin, Hongchun, Yuanxin, Xiexin, Hongsheng, Xiexing, Jiyu, Zhenxing Yuji, Baotaisunji, on Gonghe Road, Jiyuyingji, on Guangxu Road, Jiatai, on Hengfeng Road, Meifeng, and Yuanfeng, stopped work automatically, fearing that workers would come to cause trouble. Only the three factories on Changan Road, Maofeng, Fuxing, and Yuanli, continued to work as usual.</p>
<h3 id="e178">Situation in the Settlement <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>The five silk mills in the Settlement, including Taixin on Alabaster Road, Yuanhe, Jingwei, Xiangyuan on Gansu Road, and Yuyuan on Guoqing Road, were affected by the strike the day before yesterday. Yesterday morning, because Taixin and Xiangyuan Silk Factories needed to repair the engine and furnace, they did not start work yesterday. This morning, except for Taixin and Yuanhe Factories, the other three factories, Jingwei, Xiangyuan, and Yuyuan, decided to start work as usual. The workers of the three factories are also allowed to enter the factory and resume work.</p>
<h3 id="e179">Investigation of Work Resumption <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>After the workers of the 21 silk mills in the Xinzhabei and Zhabei districts experienced labor unrest, the other 12 factories, such as Beifengtai, Fuchang, Yutai, Gongda, Tiansheng, Hongyu, Yingji, Hengcang, Xinglun, and Yufeng, north of the railway, and the two factories, Yuantai and Ruilun, on Guangfu Road, started work as usual and were not affected. Yesterday morning, the three factories on Changan Road, Maofeng, Fuxing, and Yuanli, also resumed work. According to statistics, 17 factories in the Zhabei district have resumed work, while 16 factories are still suspended.</p>
<h3 id="e180">Party Department Thoroughly Investigates <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Party Department, according to the report of the Silk Workers' Union of the Sixth District, said that there were more changes in the 16 silk mills in the Xinzhabei and Zhabei districts. It was said that there must be bad elements agitating and deliberately playing tricks. Yesterday afternoon, the Municipal Party Department specially sent cadres of the Civil Affairs Section, Lu Yinchu and Fan Guoren, etc., to the Xinzhabei and Zhabei districts to thoroughly investigate the truth and decided to strictly investigate it. It also ordered the Silk Workers' Union of the Sixth District to be responsible for ordering all workers to resume work from this morning and not to cause further incidents.</p>
<h3 id="e181">The Federation of Commerce and Industry Recommends the Reason for Jointly Sharing Liabilities <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>Issue of Amending Article 681 of the Civil Code</p>
<p>The National Federation of Commerce and Industry previously requested the Legislative Yuan to amend Article 68 of the Civil Code. After receiving a reply from the Secretariat of the Legislative Yuan, which was approved and referred to the Civil Law Committee for reference, yesterday, it supplemented four reasons and contributed methods, again on behalf of  the National Government Legislative Yuan. To the Legislative Yuan in Nanjing, greetings. We have found that Article 681 of the Civil Code on Debt, which states that when the partnership property is insufficient to pay off the partnership's debts, each partner shall bear joint and several liability, is difficult to implement in practice. The subordinate association reported to your esteemed Yuan on July of this year, requesting that it be amended. On August 6, your esteemed Yuan Secretariat sent a letter stating that the regulations of Article 681 of the Civil Code have an impact on the future of commerce and are indeed correct. We request that the article be amended to share partnership debts according to shares, in order to maintain the inherent habit of fairness. There is a power report, which was approved and referred to the Civil Law Committee of this hospital for reference, etc. In addition to the transfer, the corresponding letter is sent for reference. Now, the 81st proposal of the National Industry and Commerce Conference in 19 years is a suggestion from the Chongqing Chamber of Commerce in Sichuan that the joint and several liability for partnership business stipulated in the Civil Code has caused difficulties. We request that you  formulate supplementary provisions and forward them to the Legislative Yuan for supplementary relief. Therefore, we know that the difficulty of this case has not only started today. However, when the Civil Code was promulgated at that time, the difficulties were few. Until today, the difficulties have gradually appeared and the disputes have increased. I am afraid that new partnership organizations will disappear because of this, and the old ones will also be afraid. How can we deal with partnership organizations that account for 78% of the commercial market in our country? This case concerns the prosperity and decline of the national business community, which is extremely important. The subordinate association  is deeply worried about the future. There are still four requests for immediate amendments to your esteemed hospital: The first is that Article 677 of the Civil Code stipulates that the number of profit and loss distributions shall be determined according to the proportion of each partner's investment if it has not been agreed upon. This article has clearly  stipulated that profits and losses shall be shared according to shares, while Article 681 of the same law  stipulates that partnership debts shall be jointly and severally liable. The meanings before and after are also contradictory. This should be  amended first. The law is nothing more than human donation, and human feelings are based on habit. Sharing partnership profits and losses equally is a fair habit in our country. Even if there are occasional leaks , we can only find ways to remedy them in other ways, or limit registration. If we deviate from it and become a law, then this law is outside of human feelings and will not be applicable and difficult to implement. This should be requested for amendment second. Considering the original intention of legislation at that time, it was originally afraid that cunning people would borrow money in the name of eliminating goods. Once they go bankrupt, no one will be responsible. Legislation is not inconsiderate, but its effect is the opposite. Those who are cunning  will share the debt equally after bankruptcy. Although there is no money to pay back, they will inevitably be involved in lawsuits. Now  they share the losses equally and are jointly and severally liable. Who would not want this benefit? In the future, the dishonest will regard the business community as a trap, and the cunning will regard partnerships as scams. This should be requested for amendment third. If everything is not balanced, there will be鳴. Rights and obligations must be absolutely equal to be called平. According to the provisions of Article 681 of the Civil Code, it is to enable partners to enjoy limited rights and fulfill unlimited obligations. Rights and obligations are unbalanced, and if they are not平, it will be difficult to implement and disputes will arise spontaneously. This should be requested for amendment fourth. Based on the above four points, it is reasonable to submit them again to your esteemed Yuan for inspection. We earnestly request that the text of Article 681 of the Civil Code be amended promptly. If the amendment is difficult, then or after the amendment, add a section that "However, if the partnership has been approved by the local competent authority for registration or registration, this limit shall not apply." At the same time, consult with the Executive Yuan and transfer the order to the Ministry of Industry to notify the shops organized by partnerships across the country to follow the procedure. A foolish idea, please adopt and implement it to benefit the business community. Sincerely, Chairman of the National Federation of Commerce and Industry, Lin Kanghou, Qiyin, September 8, 22nd year of the Republic of China.</p>
<h3 id="e182">The Municipal Council Clarifies the New Land Tax Discount Method <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>Only the Amount of the Increased Assessment is Discounted by 20%</p>
<p>Not a Uniform Discount on All Land Taxes</p>
<p>The Municipal Council issued a statement yesterday regarding the reassessment of land prices and the collection of new taxes. The original text stated that because the assessed land prices in several places were higher than before, permission was granted to calculate the tax on the amount of the increased assessment at an 80% discount, not a uniform discount on all land taxes. This point was omitted in yesterday's translation, resulting in a meaning  that is ambiguous and easily misunderstood. It is hereby stated again.</p>

<p>The Citizens' Federation of the First Special District of this city received a report from the First District Branch on landlords raising rents and requested the Municipal Council to restrain them. Yesterday, a letter was sent to the Municipal Council, which reads: According to the letter from the First District Branch of this Association, in order to restrict landlords from raising rents, on July 22, a letter was sent to the Shanghai Concession Taxpayers' Association to request the Municipal Council to make suggestions. Recently, merchants have closed down because they cannot support the high rent. If this continues, it will not be a blessing for the citizens, and the Municipal Council will not be able to collect taxes on empty houses. Therefore, the vacant house tax should be collected from the landlords, which can also restrain the landlords from raising rents. We urge your association to proceed in unison and maintain the business community. This kind of proposition is indeed a win-win situation. This association believes that the Municipal Council should implement it immediately to avoid further decline of the citizens and reduce taxes. Correspondingly, we ask you to investigate and deal with it accordingly. To the General Manager of the Shanghai Public Concession Municipal Council.</p>

<p>First Establish a Handicraft Training Institute</p>
<p>In order to relieve unemployed workers in this city, the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau is setting up a Civilian Factory in Gaojingmiao, Jiangwan, and forming a Preparatory Committee to discuss the implementation matters. The committee was established yesterday morning. A reporter from the Central News Agency specially interviewed Mr. Zhang Zhenyuan, who is in charge of preparing the Civilian Factory, at the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau. According to him,</p>

<p>In order to relieve unemployed workers in this city, the Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, Wu Xingya, decided to set up a Civilian Factory in the city. However, due to financial difficulties, a Handicraft Training Institute will be established first, with a budget of 30,000 yuan. It has been approved by the municipal government, and Chen Baohua, director of the General Affairs Section of the bureau, Chen Lengseng, director of the Relief Section, Wang Gang, director of the Huigong Section, and Qin Hongji, director of the Industrial Section, have been appointed as members of the Preparatory Committee.

<p>The address of the factory has been decided at Gaojingmiao near Jiangwan, because there is a very large house in the area that can be used for the factory. This house is the property of the local association, and the association has now agreed to it, so there will be no problem. Workers will be hired to clean it up within days, with the aim of opening at the end of this month. After the Handicraft Training Institute is opened, workers will be recruited to teach them handicrafts. In the future, several training institutes will be gathered together to form a civilian factory. As for the workers hired, due to financial constraints, only board and lodging will be provided, not wages.</p>

<p>The Shanghai General Office of the Red Swastika Society continued to receive a letter from the Jinan Swastika Society, detailing the distribution of relief funds and the distribution of relief in different areas, which is very detailed. The details are as follows: This time, the river broke its banks, affecting the provinces of Suroo, Yu, and Ji, which can be said to be a huge disaster. After receiving the news on August 14, this association immediately started preparations and immediately telegraphed the associations in Beiping, Shanghai, Yantai, and Qingdao to cooperate in preparing. Because we heard that Heze was severely affected, we immediately asked Mr. Fuhe, Xiang Junlin, and Liu Miaodui on the 18th to bring 2,000 yuan of relief money and various medicines to Heze to distribute the first batch of emergency relief. The Qingdao Association also sent personnel in advance, bringing 5,000 yuan of relief money to Jinan, so it was agreed that Captain Yu Jingsi and other four people from Qingdao would bring the money to Puyang and Shouzhang for emergency relief. Mr. Wang Daokui, Li Zhihao, and Wang Honglin from the Yantai Swastika Society brought 2,000 yuan of relief money to the Fengpei Yangshan area in Jiangsu Province to investigate and distribute emergency relief, all of which went on the 27th. Mr. Han Weixu brought 2,000 yuan of relief money to Dong'a and Dongping for emergency relief and set off on August 31. At that time, the President of the General Association, Su Jinglin, brought 10,000 yuan of relief money to Jinan. After discussing the location of the relief distribution, it was agreed that Mr. Lu Xuanda from the General Association and Mr. Jing Weiyi from this association would bring 3,000 yuan and various medicines to Juye. President Su led two team members, and this association again recommended Mr. Zhang Susu  to bring 4,000 yuan and various medicines to Puyang, Fanxian, Shouzhang, Yanggu, and other places, all of which set off on September 1. We also remitted another 2,000 yuan of relief money to Heze and 1,000 yuan of relief money to Dong'a and Dongping, and telegraphed to Mr. Yu and Mr. Han, who were originally recommended to distribute relief in the two places, to check the disaster situation and continue to distribute relief. In short, after this association heard about the flood, it first prepared the money. As soon as we raised the money, we went to one place to another. The purpose of the current ongoing transformation is to rescue the victims of the disaster, or to provide cooked food, or to provide rice noodles. The area affected by the disaster is vast,  and the strength of a few societies can undertake it. We only hope that the Swastika Societies and  charitable organizations in various places will rise up and work hard. All colleagues and all good people  will understand benevolence  and proceed in unison to save this vast disaster. This is a great hope.</p>

<p>The Venue is on the Fourth Floor of Sincere Company</p>
<p>Displaying the Autumn Styles of 22's Gioman Crepe</p>
<p>Meiya Silk Factory is the largest silk weaving factory in China, and new products are constantly emerging. Recently, it has specially produced a Gioman Crepe in the autumn style of 1922. Its patterns are various interlocking circles and gear shapes, which are novel and beautiful, and no one can surpass it. This design was obtained by the factory at a high price last month and was evaluated by Mr. Liu Haisu, Jiang Xiaojian, Zhang Yuguang, Ms. Li Qiujun, and Ms. Lu Xiaoman.

The clothes he was wearing were instantly eroded, and his skin was also affected. A female passenger in the rickshaw luckily did not fall, and only her left foot stepped into the acid, so her injury was relatively minor. The rickshaw puller screamed for help in agony.

However, the establishment of agricultural, engineering, and science colleges must have considerable start-up and recurring expenses, as well as sufficient equipment and excellent qualified personnel, before they can be established. The Ministry of Education must still examine its funding, equipment, and personnel to see if they meet the statutory standards as the basis for approval or disapproval.</p>

<p>Pan, Director of the Bureau, and Four Others Elected as Standing Committee Members</p>
<p>Chen Ji Cheng and Others Appointed as Members of the Childcare Business Committee　　Will Manage the Reception and Education of Homeless Beggar Children</p>
<p>The Shanghai Children's Welfare Association held its inaugural meeting in the Shanghai Municipal Government Auditorium at 2:00 PM yesterday. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>The committee members present were Mayor Wu Tie Cheng (represented by Li Ting An), Director of the Education Bureau Pan Gong Zhan, Director of the Health Bureau Li Ting An, Director of the Public Security Bureau Wen Hong En (represented by Yin Guan San), Cai Hong Tian of the Municipal Party Department, Yang Zhi Hao of the Bar Association, Huang Zao Xiong of the Municipal Education Association, Hu Shu Yi of the Children's Morning News, Chen Song Chun of the Citizen Education Center, Wang Zhong Fu of the Chinese Women and Children Relief Association, Wang Bin Yan of the Zha Bei Charity Group, and expert committee members Wang Guan Yi, Zhu Shao Ping, Zhu Zi Qiao, Qiu Xi Sheng, Hu Shu Yi, Guo Shun, Chen Ji Cheng, Chen He Qin, Liu Wang Li Ming, and other twenty people.</p>
<p>Establishment Situation The meeting opened at 2:00 PM, and the mayor's representative Li Ting An was publicly elected as the temporary chairman, Hu Shu Yi was the recorder, Chen Song Chun was the master of ceremonies, and the ceremony was performed as usual. First, the chairman reported the meaning of forming this association and read the association's brief rules. Then, Director Pan of the Education Bureau reported on the preparations and the monthly recurring expense budget. Immediately, the standing committee members were elected, and the progress of the association affairs was discussed. The meeting was photographed and dismissed at around 4:00 PM.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report Chairman Li Ting An, representing Mayor Wu, reported that the purpose of the establishment of this association is to promote social attention to the status of children, develop children's businesses, and seek the happiness of all children in the city. Chinese children have always been in a harsh environment, and their status is very miserable. Such as forcing children to work, not paying attention to children's health, and trafficking abuse, and other harmful acts against children, are everywhere. As a result, the infant mortality rate is as high as three out of every thousand people, more than three times higher than in Europe and the United States. It must be known that today's children are the future masters of the country. If they are destroyed during the development period, they will not be able to become healthy citizens in the future, which will affect the future of the country, which is extremely serious. Therefore, after the establishment of this association, the colleagues of this association should do their work conscientiously and be responsible for protecting the happiness of children.</p>

<p>Preparation Process Next, Director Pan of the Education Bureau reported on the preparation process, saying that the motivation for initiating the organization of this association was that during the Children's Day held on April 4 this year, everyone felt that the development of children's undertakings could not be achieved by holding commemorative events on Children's Day. There must be a permanent agency to gradually seek the happiness of children. Therefore, the Education, Social, Health, and Public Security Bureaus were jointly responsible for preparing to organize the Municipal Children's Welfare Association and drafted brief rules that were submitted to the Municipal Government for record in mid-May. Also, in mid-June, in view of the difficulty of caring for children among the general factory workers, it initiated the organization of the Childcare Business Committee to prepare for the establishment of childcare centers. By mid-August, in accordance with the regulations, representatives of the national system and experts who were enthusiastic about children's undertakings were hired to serve as members of this association. It has been five months since the establishment so far. In the future, it is hoped that all members will work together to seek the happiness of all children in the city.</p>
<p>Election of Standing Committee After the report, the standing committee was elected. According to the association's brief rules, the number of standing committee members was fixed at five. However, all committee members agreed that five people were too few and unanimously agreed to increase it to seven. An election was held on the spot. As a result, the Director of the Education Bureau, the Child Welfare Association, the Director of the Health Bureau, the Children's Morning News, Chen He Qin and other five people were definitely elected as standing committee members. Hu Shu Yi and Liu Wang Li Ming had the next highest number of votes. When the number of standing committee members is submitted to the municipal government for approval to increase to seven, these second most members will become official standing committee members.</p>

The Standing Committee will consider and appoint the candidates for each committee from the members of this association.

In accordance with the Ministry's orders, this bureau has organized free vaccinations in spring and autumn in the past. Now that the weather is cool in autumn, smallpox will be prevalent again. In order to maintain the health of all students, this bureau has decided to start vaccinations on the 15th of this month. However, the effective period of vaccination can last at least three years. All old students who have been vaccinated in the spring do not need to be vaccinated again. The vaccination schedule starts from the rural schools in the city, followed by the city schools in the urban area, and then the private registered schools and private unregistered schools. Therefore, in addition to replying to the letter, this order is hereby issued to inform the school.</p>

<p>Discovery by the Institute of Botany, National Peking Academy</p>
<h3 id="e223">The Mysterious Scenery of Plants on the Kunlun Mountains and Tibetan Plateau (Part 1) <a href="#e223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>Construction of Laboratories for Lower Plants and Cryptogams</p>
<p>Establishment of Nature Reserves and Return of Specimens from Xinjiang and Mongolia</p>
<p>(Special Dispatch from Beiping) The Institute of Botany of the National Peking Academy began preparations in September of the 18th year of the Republic of China, hiring Dr. Liu Shen'e as a part-time researcher and director of the Institute, and Dr. Lin Rong as a part-time researcher. Recently, Dr. Liu Zhen'e was changed to a full-time researcher and director, and Zhong Guangguang was hired as a full-time researcher. At the beginning of the preparations, the Institute selected Laiyuan Building in the Natural History Museum as the site, made some repairs, and started work. On the one hand, it engaged in collections near Beiping, and on the other hand, it sorted out specimens donated by various parties. Over the years, it has gradually expanded, increased equipment, carried out long-term and long-distance collections, and in addition to research work, in order to popularize biological knowledge, it has jointly established a botanical garden with the Natural History Museum to cultivate local and foreign plants for observation. The Institute currently has three researchers, five assistants, one draftsman, one botanical garden administrator, one trainee, one clerk, and one typist.</p>
<h3 id="e224">Construction and Equipment <a href="#e224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>Most of the funding for the Institute of Botany is used for collecting specimens and purchasing books, so it has not been able to expand in terms of construction. When the Institute's staff goes out to collect in the summer and autumn, it feels a little more spacious, but in the winter, many people live in one room, which is quite cramped. The existing buildings can be divided into the following five parts: (1) The research is located in Laiyuan Building, which has a total of twelve rooms. Except for two rooms that serve as passageways upstairs and downstairs, the rest are used for offices, libraries, and research. (2) The specimen room has fourteen main rooms, located south of Laiyuan Building. It was converted from the animal specimen room of the former agricultural experiment station and is still considered spacious. The four corridors are separated into multiple rooms, which are planned to be used for organizing specimens. (3) The botanical garden is jointly operated by the Institute of Botany and the Natural History Museum, covering an area of ​​about 40 acres. Local and foreign plants are cultivated according to classification order. Currently, about 700 species have been cultivated. (4) There are five storage rooms, which currently store heavy plant specimens. (5) There are currently fourteen staff rooms. As for the equipment of the Institute, the main points are as follows: (1) Instruments and books. The current work of the Institute focuses on the classification and distribution of Chinese plants, so all instruments are only for use and are very simple. There are only a few microscopes, cameras, etc. Specimen cabinets are gradually added, and there are currently 103 cabinets and more than 1,000 glass bottles. The Institute's books are currently mainly about seed plants, with more than 130 types. There are also several complete old magazines, which are not easy to buy. (2) Specimens. Except for a part that was donated and exchanged by local areas, the rest were collected by the Institute itself in the past two years. There are currently about 24,000 copies. Specimens have been collected from Hebei, Shanxi, Shandong, Henan, Chahar, Suiyuan, Gansu, Qinghai, Xinjiang, Liaoning, Jilin, Sichuan, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, Guangdong and other provinces.</p>
<h3 id="e225">Future Plans <a href="#e225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>(1) Separate research rooms. The current research of the Institute of Botany focuses on the classification of higher plants due to practical needs, and lower plants are only taken care of with spare energy. However, moss, fungi, algae, and other things have a wide range, and their research methods are not entirely the same as those of higher plants, so the equipment is also different. It is planned to use the existing research rooms to specialize in the research of higher plants, and build new houses to establish research rooms for lower plants, cryptogams, or cryptogams." Researching biology should not focus solely on indoor work, but should seek to be close to nature and personally observe the phenomenon of plant growth in the wild. This kind of work cannot be effective with short-term collections. In European and American countries, research rooms are often established in the wild due to special local conditions, so that long-term field investigations can be carried out. The Institute also intends to follow this idea and establish a high-mountain plant research room near Beiping or in a farther place. (2) Add books and instruments. The Institute's collection of books is not sufficient, and it is inconvenient to travel back and forth to various libraries in Beiping City when consulting books in the suburbs. Therefore, it has recently been trying to purchase books. As for instruments, since it is planned to set up separate research rooms, there are many that still need to be added. (3) Establish natural protected areas. All things in nature live together, compete for growth and thrive. Every time human intervention is implemented, the face is changed, or it is completely destroyed. Rare species are even extinct, which is very sad. Therefore, European and American countries all have natural protected areas. Within the area, the growth and decline of organisms are left to nature. Chinese people often do not care about this. For example, the few remaining small forests near Beiping have been severely cut down in recent years. In a few years, they will all become bald mountains and ridges, without any green. The Institute also intends to pay attention to this aspect this time, or to establish a natural protected area on its own, and set up a research room in it. (4) Promote botanical gardens. The establishment of botanical gardens is not only for social observation,</p>
<p>teaching materials for schools, but also to preserve living specimens for reference during research. Even in plant taxonomy, there are often problems that need to be solved by observing plant growth. In addition to planning to promote the original botanical garden, the Institute also plans to select a suitable location in the Natural History Museum to set up a forest garden and build another greenhouse. In addition, the Institute has transported back many seeds from Xinjiang, Mongolia, and other places, and has long planned to establish a border plant garden, but it has not been able to implement it due to limited funding. In addition to the above-mentioned botanical garden, forest garden, and border plant garden, it is also planned to open an experimental field for research purposes. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Former Champion Lost to Galento</p>
<p>Crawford and Panley Advance Together</p>
<p>(Reuters, Forest Hills, September 7) The U.S. Men's Singles Tennis Championship has become increasingly tense since its start, with one scene after another. It is now in the semi-finals, and those who have qualified are:</p>
<p>(1) Galento vs. Stokeson (2) Panley vs. Quistor</p>
<p>(3) Hughes vs. Malchen (4) Crawford vs. McEnroe or Hewitt</p>
<p>Vance Disappointed There are three major players in this year's U.S. Open that have attracted the most attention from the public. One is Crawford, the Australian and Wimbledon champion, one is Panley, the leader of the British Davis Cup, and the other is Vance, the champion of the competition. The three had a smooth journey, passing three rounds in a row. However, by the fourth week, Vance was disappointed and eliminated by Galento. As a result, all three sets were 6-3, obviously losing his inherent vigor.</p>
<p>Crawford Works Hard Recently, Crawford's brilliance has reached its peak. He was triumphant at Wimbledon, and now he is turning his attention to the U.S. Open. After passing three rounds, he met Wood, the 1931 champion, and won 3-1. In the first two sets, Crawford won 6-4 in a row. He lost the third set 2-6. After two hours of wonderful competition in the fourth set, the final victory of 8-6 also went to Crawford.

<p>Second Week Has Ended</p>
<p>The second week of the Shanghai McGer Singles Tennis Tournament ended yesterday. Four groups fought each other, and the struggle between Cai Houfa and Yao Xingen was the most intense. The strength of both sides can be said to be evenly matched. Cai took the lead in the first set with 6-3. Cai's courage increased in the second set, and he tied each set with 6-1.

<p>The Youyou Cup Singles Tennis Tournament has been going on for more than a month. All new players in Shanghai have joined, so this competition is particularly noteworthy. Zheng Zhaojia, who is expected by everyone, has lost a set to Liang Deguang, Guo Yujie, Ma Anquan, and the host of the Youyou Cup, Cheng Yize. Ma Anquan lost to Zheng in straight sets in the China Singles Tournament, but in the Youyou Cup, Zheng only won by two to one set. Is it that Zheng's technology has regressed? Yesterday, there was another unexpected result in the competition, that is, Sun Linfang, the junior singles champion of last year's Grass Court Association, lost to Guo Yujie in straight sets. Sun's technology has improved a lot recently. In the first round of the senior singles competition of this year's Grass Court Association, Sun won against the American Smith in five sets. Unexpectedly, he was no match for Guo Yujie. The competition was fierce in the first set, but the second and third sets were one-sided. Guo won extremely easily. Sun is good at hard-hitting shots, while Guo is steady, patient, and good at going online. Guo's victory over Sun can be said to be winning steel with softness. From this point of view, Guo Yujie, the only Chinese player left in this year's Grass Court Tennis Junior Singles Championship, has great hope of winning the championship. The results of the Youyou Cup yesterday and today's schedule are recorded below:</p>

<h3 id="e245">Saying "Five" <a href="#e245" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c245" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">245</a></h3>
<p>— Qi Ling</p>
<p>Reading Mr. Xing Zhi's discussion of "Three" in this publication, I can't help but feel that there is also a need to discuss "Five." "Three" and "Five" are both nouns for numbers, and the construction of their characters is very similar. The number "Five" is larger than "Three," but in China, I feel that "Five" is even more worthy of remembrance.</p>
<p>Sun Yat-sen originally created the Five-Power Constitution, using the character "Five." It is said that with the Five-Power Constitution, the country can be revitalized and governed, and this "Five" character becomes extraordinary. Foreigners mock our compatriots for lacking perseverance, calling it "five-minute enthusiasm." Here, we feel that this "Five" character is not good and contains insults.</p>
<p>Due to the continuous oppression of foreign aggression, many anniversaries related to "Five" have been added. After "May Seventh," "May Ninth," and "May Thirtieth," the anniversaries with "Five" are all considered inauspicious terms. There are many other anniversaries related to "Five," such as "May First" Labor Day and "May Fourth" Student Movement.</p>
<p>Asia, Europe, America, Australia, and Africa are called the Five Continents; the Pacific, Indian, Atlantic, Southern, and Arctic Oceans are called the Five Oceans; Yellow, White, Black, Red, and Brown are called the Five Races; Han, Manchu, Mongol, Hui, and Tibetan are called the Five Ethnic Groups; Mount Tai, Mount Hua, Mount Heng, Mount Heng, and Mount Song are called the Five Sacred Mountains; the Book of Poetry, the Book of Documents, the Book of Changes, the Book of Rites, and the Spring and Autumn Annals are called the Five Classics; Benevolence, Righteousness, Propriety, Wisdom, and Trustworthiness are called the Five Constant Virtues; Gong, Shang, Jiao, Zhi, and Yu are called the Five Tones; East, West, North, South, and Center are called the Five Directions; Branding, Nose Cutting, Foot Cutting, Castration, and Death Penalty are called the Five Punishments; Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth are called the Five Elements; Liver, Heart, Spleen, Lungs, and Kidneys are called the Five Viscera; Ears, Eyes, Mouth, Nose, and Tongue are called the Five Senses. There are too many applications of the word "Five" to describe them all at once. In modern times, Britain, the United States, Japan, France, and Italy are called the Five Powers. Soviet Russia has a Five-Year Plan, and the prize money for aviation lotteries must be 500,000. The Fifth Plenary Session is about to open. I hope that the ruling gentlemen will set a grand plan as soon as possible, so that there will be no more disunity. Let everyone devote their five points of strength, become proficient in the five kinds of weapons, organize their five armies, respectfully spread the five teachings, respectfully use the five powers, sacrifice five feet, shed blood five steps, and engage in a final five-minute duel with the enemy. Only then can we protect our five ethnic groups, defend our five lands, and make our five-thousand-year-old Chinese ancient country stand out among the five continents and be listed among the five powers. Then, there will be no more humiliating and power-losing events such as the five treaty ports.</p>

<p>— Qian Yun writes, Lian Liang draws</p>
<p>丨They in the Summer Heat丨</p>
<p>In this summer of 1933, if you don't do something utterly fashionable, you risk being considered wronged, affected, or foolish. Chewing ice and taking a drive are nothing. Going to an air-conditioned room, a swimming pool, or Qingdao is what shows you're modernized. The air conditioning freezes Mr. Wang's teeth until they chatter against each other. He takes a packet of herbal tea that night, saying it's "xieyi" (carefree). Swimming pools in Gaoqiao and Hongkou are even more crowded. Anyway, even if you don't know how to swim, it's good to soak your skin. Then take a few photos in your swimming suit. Some people are so obsessed that they even swim in the bathtub, not caring about the water splashing everywhere, but saying that the water here has absolutely no salty taste. Speaking of Qingdao, Mogan Mountain, and Putuo for summering, of course, these are fashionable, luxurious, and comfortable things. A tanned man's face is healthy, a tanned woman's... is beautiful. But these places seem to be specially prepared for the rich in Shanghai to enjoy themselves, regardless of whether these places are truly enjoyable. Only one day, I happened to stand in front of a blacksmith shop in Nanshi for a long time, watching two workers blacksmithing. The red-hot iron block was taken out of the fire hole with tongs and beaten alternately, up and down, from a thick block to a thin sheet. The transformation from red-hot to gray in that instant was quite interesting. But needless to say, the two men were covered in sweat, and the drops covered their eyes. They couldn't extend a third hand to wipe them away, letting them drip down. The child carrying the furnace next to them had a face that was especially red and black, illuminated by the firelight. They themselves wouldn't, but I imagined for them that if they were to go to an air-conditioned room, a swimming pool, or Qingdao at this time, wouldn't they... Oh! Don't say it, saying it would make most people laugh their heads off.</p>
<p>There were no other thoughts on this day, and thinking about it would never end. I only felt that the weather had become particularly cool because of it!</p>
<h3 id="e247">Madam Wang, the Teacher <a href="#e247" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c247" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">247</a></h3>
<p>— Zhao Ziming</p>
<p>Last time, I introduced Teacher Wang. Now, let me introduce his wife.</p>
<p>She came from a magistrate's family. When Teacher Wang was serving as a secretary, the magistrate loved him for his youth and handsomeness, so he made him his son-in-law. She is very obese, but she accompanies the medicine pot every other day, much like the sickly "Lin Daiyu." Now, her temples are as white as frost, and she still rubs on shimmering hair growth oil. Her three-inch golden lilies are shod in blood-red embroidered shoes. She is truly "old in years, but not in heart"!</p>
<p>She knows "Kong Yiji" and "Hua Sanqian," but she only knows about twenty characters in total.</p>
<p>One day, she had a get-rich dream and bought a lottery ticket. She treasured it very much. When the draw came, she realized that she had bought an old ticket from last year's draw. Teacher Wang loves money as his life, so she didn't dare to tell him. This is also the benefit of "a woman's lack of talent is a virtue"!</p>
<p>In the winter, when it snowed heavily and the road was muddy, she went out to buy soy sauce and slipped on the snow. She didn't want passersby to help her and slowly got up on her own because "men and women should not touch hands."</p>
<p>Sometimes, she would cry with her head in her hands, pointing at Teacher Wang and complaining: "I married you for a lifetime and haven't had a happy day, haven't worn a new dress, and haven't eaten a peaceful meal. My life is so thin!" In fact, Teacher Wang used to be popular too. How could she not have enjoyed happiness? I can't help but call out injustice for Teacher Wang! But her purpose in marrying Teacher Wang was only for good clothes and good food!</p>
<p>When she saw women cutting their hair, she strongly disapproved, scolding them as demons, neither like nuns nor like monks!</p>
<p>Later, after Teacher Wang died of cholera, she lay on his corpse and cried all day long. Soon, she also contracted cholera and followed Teacher Wang to the underworld. It can be considered that "they were shoulder to shoulder in life and became flounders in death."</p>
<h3 id="e248">Leg Talk <a href="#e248" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c248" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">248</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Xianling</p>
<p>The even number of legs is simply always a double number. The Shang Yang in the primer has three legs, the Long Xuhu in the Investiture of the Gods has one leg, and Liu Hai's mount is a three-legged toad. However, these strange legs with different numbers have no confirmed textual research and are mostly regarded as folktales, so they cannot be considered as odd legs.</p>
<p>Human beings are divided into three types: male, female, and neither male nor female. Usually, there are two types: male and female. All three types of people have two legs. Since the beginning of history, there has never been anyone seen with one or three legs, unless they were injured and had one leg amputated or completely amputated. However, people's legs have clever names: iron legs, big legs, long legs, beautiful legs, fast legs, etc. Things in the world are often unexpected. In the current society where capitalism is rampant, people's legs have actually become commercial advertising competitions. Like the movie advertisements in various newspapers, women's bare legs occupy the eyes of movie fans one by one. Not only is this the case in commerce, but it is also the case in gender issues. The women seen on the street, when you don't pay attention to their faces, those two legs have already invaded your eyes. In the summer, women even bare their legs and wear shorts. This kind of policy often makes Liu Xiahui's heart flutter, and he no longer dares to say that form is emptiness.</p>
<p>I heard that American movie stars draw many human heads and other flowers and plants on their legs as decoration. Our Chinese women only have the trend of bare legs. Perhaps they will follow in the footsteps of American movie stars in the future. If the use of legs can be developed to the highest peak, then the exchange value can also flourish arbitrarily. We will always see the mystery of legs in the future.</p>

<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Fifteen: The guest leaves with shyness, and tender feelings stir. The smiling person comes to visit, and old grievances and bad news cause sorrow.</p>
<p>A joyful atmosphere filled the room. Zhao Ziqiang and Yang Guizhi's shy expressions also dissolved in the joy. Huang Manying looked at this scene and smiled at Guizhi. "Today, our efforts were not in vain. I hope that from now on, you will make appointments to come here yourselves. Don't travel dozens of miles to find me, just to eat a bowl of tangyuan." Guizhi lowered her head, only smiling as she ate, without saying anything. Huang Manying said sternly, "Yang, don't be shy. I'm talking to you seriously." Guizhi smiled, "Why should I be shy? If I were shy, I wouldn't come." Tian Qing reached out and gently patted Zhao Ziqiang's arm twice, laughing. "Did you hear that? People aren't shy, are you still shy?" Zhao Ziqiang smiled, "Who can be like you guys?" Tian Qing said to Huang Manying, "Did you hear that? He said he can't be like you guys. Your opposite is us. He also knows to say 'us'." Zhao Ziqiang said, "Xiao Tian, ​​you're getting better and better at talking. I can say you're not weak." Just as they were saying this, Huang Manying suddenly frowned, repeatedly calling out, "What to do? What to do?" Tian Qing was startled and stood up. He asked him, "What's wrong with you?" Manying walked towards the outside of the private room, beckoning to him. Tian Qing had no choice but to follow him out. After a while, he stumbled back in three steps and two steps, grabbed the military cap on the table, and stumbled out again. Zhao Ziqiang thought that Huang Manying had something inconvenient, so he left. Tian Qing, of course, followed to serve him. Guizhi sat on the side, thinking the same thing in her heart. Although the two of them had left, she sitting here alone was a bit awkward, but looking at Huang...</p>
<p>Manying's appearance, she couldn't stop them. So, she watched them leave, and she just held the tangyuan bowl, only lowering her head to drink the broth. (182)</p>
<p>Short Story</p>
<h3 id="e250">The First Autumn Rain (Part 2) <a href="#e250" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c250" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">250</a></h3>
<p>— Hu Liwen</p>
<p>"Xiuer! 丨丨" My mother's voice was a little trembling, "Don't go there anymore! Just stay at home, we can make a living by farming, why do you have to suffer from other people's temper!"</p>
<p>"Really! Little brother, it's better not to go there!"</p>
<p>My sister echoed with this sentence. I looked at her smiling face, wanting to argue, but sorrow filled my throat, and I could no longer speak.</p>
<p>My sister and I went to the living room to eat. There were only the two of us at the table. My sister told me: My mother hasn't eaten for half a month, drinking only thin rice porridge every day. Today, because I came back, my sister specially bought a pot of wine to welcome me. She never liked drinking, but today, to accompany me, she drank several cups in a row. The corners of her eyebrows turned a faint red. She smiled and talked to me about the situation after we parted. I listened, I drank wine, but I didn't say a word.</p>
<p>Ah Hua ran in panting. In the past, I liked it very much. I often took it to play in the wild, to bathe in the stream. Now, it seems to be estranged from me. It glared at me and turned to my sister, first sniffing her feet, then sniffing her calves, then raising its two front paws and placing them on her knees, looking up at her, its tail wagging non-stop. My sister reached out and stroked its head, smiling and pointing at me, asking it:</p>
<p>"Hua! Do you still recognize your little master?"</p>
<p>As if understanding my sister's words, Ah Hua glanced at me and ran over to me, wagging its tail and rubbing against my legs, showing affection. I picked up a piece of tofu for it. It stood up like a child, its front paws hanging down, its head raised, and from between my chopsticks, it swallowed the piece of tofu into its stomach.</p>
<p>Suddenly, my mother called me urgently in the room, her voice obviously different. I hurried in. My mother was already sitting up, and a person was standing in front of her. I recognized him as the accountant from our factory. I didn't know what was going on and was about to go forward and ask him. Suddenly, he turned around, grabbed my arm like a fierce god, and dragged me out, shouting:</p>
<p>"Hurry! Come back with me! The boss is throwing a temper there. He doesn't allow you to take leave, how dare you be so bold and run back on your own?"</p>
<p>My mother shouted loudly, "Xiuer! My child! Don't go! Don't go! Is he here to catch you? Beat him to death!" She jumped off the bed and grabbed my clothes. My sister also hugged my waist. Even Ah Hua bit my trouser leg. They cried, shouted, and yelled, pulling me inward together. I was pulled down by them.</p>
<p>Opening my eyes, I was still lying in bed. The electric light in the room laughed coldly at me. The sound of the first autumn rain burst outside the window. Cold sweat soaked my short shirt. I recalled the dream I just had. I was both happy and sorrowful and angry. I really wanted to immediately</p>
<p>丨At least tomorrow morning丨丨 set off to go home, but is it possible? The first time I asked for leave, it was not approved. The second time I asked for leave, I was scolded. Who would dare to try again? And tomorrow I have to continue my struggle.</p>
<p>"The flames of the electric light scorch my body; the sound of rain outside the window shatters the strings of my heart.</p>
<p>I wish to turn into the storm of autumn,</p>
<p>Sprinkling on the door of my hometown!"</p>
<p>I murmured. My tears fell again.</p>

<h3 id="e251">Gold, Commodity Prices, and Stocks Fall; Premium Recovers to Four Dollars and Six Cents <a href="#e251" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c251" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">251</a></h3>
<p>丨Situation Lingers, Many Consolidation Patterns丨</p>
<p>Yesterday, the gold market saw mixed signals. Although overseas reports indicated a slight rise in silver prices in England and the United States, exchange rates turned downward. The forward silver price at the Metal Exchange rose by nine haos to one li and nine fen, but there was little demand. In addition, American cotton fell by fourteen pounds, American wheat shrank by one and three-quarters, and stocks fell by more than one dollar. This improved sentiment. The opening price for raw gold was 827 yuan, a slight dip due to selling by Daxing, Yongheng, and Xing. After the opening, banks dumped, and the exchange market hardened and turned downward. HSBC's listed prices were announced, with no changes in shillings or US dollars. At this time, the market turned flat. Bank dumping briefly caused a slight delay in the rise, but ultimately fell back as banks were still willing to supply at high prices. The situation lingered, with many consolidation patterns. The opening price in the afternoon fell, due to a Reuters report that the American Bankers Association convention had agreed to extend loans to industry and commerce and cooperate with the National Recovery Administration within a sound business scope. Although this did not have a major impact, it turned sentiment weary. Afterwards, the market gradually became peaceful, with little trading. The situation lingered, and rose again near closing. The current price was increased by 270 yuan. Here is a record of the day's market situation:</p>
<p>The morning opening was 824.5 yuan, a rebound of three yuan compared to the previous closing. The commodity price opened at four dollars and six cents.

Zhenjin sold November US dollars at 1.125, the exchange market hardened, and fell to 1.9 yuan. As the expected HSBC listing did not move, sentiment was boosted, as long expectations prevailed, and short sellers rushed to cover. In addition, Hengyu and Fuyu also bought, and rose to 4.8 yuan. Huabi came out with November US dollars at 3.125, commodity prices such as Dadecheng, Zhaofengchang, and Fuyu were sold, falling to 2.7 yuan. Wanxing accepted orders and stabilized. Later, Yifeng, Yongfuchang, Cuitai, Yuansheng Yong, and others entered orders one after another, and December US dollars were difficult to settle at half a yuan. It rose to 7.2 yuan. Pan Gen sold December US dollars at 4.375, Wanxing and Hengyu sold, falling back to two yuan. Hengxing was undergoing renovations, and was still able to struggle around six yuan. After this, Zhenjin continuously sold December US dollars at half a yuan, Zhengchang, Yuanmao Yong slightly sold, sentiment wavered, and fell back to 4.2 yuan. Although Shanghai came out with October US dollars at 1.125, it gradually became difficult to settle, Hengxing and Shunli jointly bought, rising to 6.7 yuan. Cuitai sold, and the midday closing was 826.2 yuan, the commodity price was pegged at 6.8 yuan, finally around seven yuan.</p>
<p>The afternoon opening retreated to 5.2 yuan, the commodity price opened at 5.1 yuan. Although Hengxing entered, it was 5.4 yuan, but due to Yuansheng Yong, Yuanmao Yong, Daxing Yong jointly selling, it retreated to 3.5 yuan, as overseas reports said that American banks had approved the President's expansion of credit loans, and sentiment turned downward. Dalian Gang bought on dips and stabilized, Zhenjin ate December US dollars at half a yuan, Dafayong Hengyu also entered, and was around five yuan, but mostly hovered. Later, due to retail price increases, it rose to more than five yuan, Maijia Li Zhenjin did December at half a yuan, Yuansheng Yong Yuanchun Zhifeng Yong successively bought, rising to 6.3 yuan. Hengyu Zhichang sold and retreated. Afterwards, although Yuansheng Yong Yicheng sold, it was difficult to break five yuan because Daxing Yong Zhifeng Yong Chunyuan Yong and others all entered. Finally, with Hengxing Tongchun entering orders, the closing was 826.1 yuan. After closing, Hengxing continued to accept, rising to around seven yuan, and the commodity price was pegged at 6.8 yuan. Checking, the highest price of the day was 827.2 yuan, the lowest price was 821.9 yuan, with a fluctuation of 5.3 yuan. As a result, it rebounded by 4.6 yuan compared to the previous closing.</p>
<p>The listed price was unchanged due to the HSBC Bank's US dollar listing, at 28.375 yuan, the combined premium price was 845 yuan, eight jiao, and one fen. According to the closing price, it was approximately pressed down by nine yuan, less than five yuan weaker than the previous closing.

<h3 id="e256">Smooth Lushan Conference on Securities <a href="#e256" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c256" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">256</a></h3>
<p>The long-strained bond market shows a slight recovery</p>
<p>The process is one of gradual increase from a low point.</p>
<p>Trading is relatively lively.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Securities Exchange and the market showed signs of recovery, and trading was active. Buying and selling on the floor were quite lively. Market rumors suggest that the Lushan Conference can generally resolve issues. There are whispers of a comprehensive plan requiring significant funds, which will inevitably lead to the issuance of new public bonds to inject capital and address cotton and wheat problems. However, obtaining cash is still the prerequisite. The methods are expected to be announced soon. The market, encouraged by the conference's progress, saw a shift in sentiment, with prices initially falling before rising. The morning's opening was sluggish, with various trading houses slightly selling off, causing prices to dip by about two-tenths of a yuan. In the second session, the 1918 and 1919 bonds remained weak, continuing to fall by about one-tenth of a yuan. From the 1920 bonds onwards, bullish and bearish trades gradually surged, with significant competition between the two sides. Although there were many sellers of the No. 11 bonds, the strong demand from various trading houses gradually pushed prices higher. Consequently, later bonds rose by five fen to three jiao five fen. This was attributed to market rumors of the Lushan Conference's success, boosting confidence. At the afternoon opening, retail investors covered their short positions, and Northern trading houses continued to sell, but supply could not meet demand, and prices continued to rise by one or two jiao. Trading was cleared at the close. This month's 1919 Customs Consolidation and 1920 Customs Consolidation bonds failed to open, while trading in other bonds was scarce, with fluctuations of only five fen or one jiao. The outcome, as expected by reporters, was a slight recovery, with bond prices rising slightly by one jiao to four jiao. Due to the many post-Lushan Conference issues, market prices are expected to fluctuate. The total trading volume was 9.205 million yuan. There were no spot transactions. Futures transactions totaled 3.655 million for Salt Tax, 735,000 for Military Reduction, 1.17 million for 1919 Customs Consolidation, 1.655 million for 1920 Customs Consolidation, and 895,000 yuan for 96 bonds, with the remainder ranging from tens of thousands to one or two hundred thousand.</p>

<p>A report from New F丰洋行 indicates that the New York stock market was quite gloomy on the 7th, with closing prices falling. Steel stocks saw relatively stable trading; otherwise, the market would have been even more dismal. Steel production has been reduced by 55% due to the final adjustments to comply with the new regulations of the National Recovery Program and the gradual decrease in consumption of the automotive and railway industries. The total trading volume for the day was 1,070,000 shares. The New York Stock Exchange announced that the commodity exchange would indefinitely suspend Saturday's raw silk futures trading following the implementation of the new regulations. The Washington Treasury Department announced that the market price of newly produced gold would be reported daily starting from the 8th, with trading allowed both domestically and internationally. As for wheat, Liverpool reported sluggishness. The New York market lacked purchasing power yesterday, and the weather remained dry. News from Argentina was quite good, but buyers remained hesitant. Cotton saw some easy sales in the South, but demand was quite low. The silver market was stable but gloomy. The Dow Jones indices are listed below:</p>

<p>The yarn market is once again weak, with the situation slightly deteriorating. After high prices, buyers are scarce, mainly because the surrounding environment remains difficult to be optimistic about. However, current yarn sales are still relatively good. As for the talk of factory support, it has now faded away. As a result, sellers are actively unloading, causing the market to fall. In the afternoon, Ewo Factory reportedly released 6,000 bales of 20-count Five Blessings Shepherd yarn at a price of 192 yuan.</p>

<p>The cotton market is trending weaker, with the firmness of the previous day slightly easing. The clear weather following the White Dew solar term is significantly beneficial to new cotton. Secondly, although private estimates of US cotton are low, market prices have fallen by over ten pounds, softening sentiment. Both bulls and bears remain inactive, awaiting the US government's estimates tomorrow to determine the outcome. Another view is that new cotton arrivals are not strong, making it difficult for prices in the producing areas to decline. Therefore, sentiment is slightly optimistic.</p>

<p>Regarding the recent wind disaster's impact on Nantong cotton production, we received news from a friend in Nantong today. The strong winds in Nantong, after observation, caused only minor damage, such as some shedding of already-opened cotton fibers and new bolls, and some flooding of cotton fields along the river. The estimated maximum loss is only about 4-5%. However, the two counties of Qidong and Hai站门 have seen reduced cotton yields due to the dry summer, which hindered cotton seedling development. People from Baoshan say that the wind disaster's impact was not significant because about one-third of the bolls have already opened, and even unopened bolls are already quite large, making them less likely to be blown off. However, the current tender bolls may be somewhat diminished.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the US cotton market was mixed, awaiting the next government report. Prices initially rose due to short covering, then fell due to Southern hedging sales. As a result, spot prices fell by ten points, and futures fell by thirteen to seventeen points. Liverpool cotton spot prices rose by ten points, and futures rose by five points. Egyptian cotton spot prices rose by eight points. The Bombay market remains closed. Original telegrams are listed below (dated 7th):</p>

<p>The flour market opened lower this morning due to weak sentiment and foreign wheat prices falling by four or five jiao. Flour mills were actively dumping and hedging, with Fuxin selling over 100,000 sacks. Fufeng and others also sold. Although some customers came to cover shorts, the limited buying could not support the market. In the first session of the afternoon, the current month fell by three fen, and other months fell by two fen. Later, some mills stopped dumping, and customers took advantage of the lower prices to buy, causing the market to recover slightly. However, with ample inventories and sluggish sales, the situation remains unfavorable. Closing prices were down 1.25 fen for the current month, 1.25 fen for October, 1.75 fen for November, 1.25 fen for December, and 0.75 fen for January and February.</p>
<h3 id="e269">Futures Wheat Gradually Declined <a href="#e269" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c269" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">269</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's wheat market saw gradual declines in both the upper and lower markets for all months. This was due to the large inventories of current wheat, sluggish milling demand, and the increasing trend of borrowing wheat, leading to weak sentiment and hesitant stockpiling. Although major bulls wanted to maintain prices, they did not dare to buy in large quantities. With weak current sales, traders mostly hedged on the exchange, focusing on the near term, further weakening the market. Many floating positions also tried to sell out. Market prices fell repeatedly. Closing prices were down eight fen for October, six fen for September, five fen for November, four fen for December and January, and one fen for February. Current wheat milling demand was flat. Yesterday, Jingjiang wheat opened at 3.63 yuan, Zhenjiang at 3.5 yuan, and exposed-gluten at 3.66 yuan, totaling 1,200 sacks, purchased by Fuxin.</p>
<h3 id="e270">Foreign Rice Trading Stalled <a href="#e270" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c270" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">270</a></h3>
<p>| Inventory: 267,837 Sacks |</p>
<p>There were no wholesale transactions of foreign rice yesterday. The Saigon rice needed in this area had low inventories, so the owners were asking high prices. Small batches of Ningbo rice still had demand, but the prices were unfavorable, so both sides stalled, and no agreement was reached. Currently, new arrivals of foreign rice are difficult to clear, and the owners believe that inventories are decreasing, and they are already losing money at current prices, so they are unwilling to sell cheaply. Although the total inventory is large, much of it is held up due to disputes, and only about 100,000 sacks can be sold at market prices. If one trading house were to buy, this small amount would be easily sold. Buyers believe that with domestic flour, wheat, rice, beans, and miscellaneous grains all falling, new rice is arriving in large quantities, and the late rice harvest is expected to be good. Future arrivals will be abundant, and the market will be oversupplied. Currently, new Ke Xian rice is arriving, so there is no need to focus on foreign rice, and they are determined not to buy unless prices fall. Therefore, both sides are waiting and watching.</p>
<p>Although there have been no new arrivals of foreign rice recently, some old Yangtze rice has been returned to Shanghai, and some remaining orders are also arriving. Therefore, apart from the volume handled by local traders, the total inventory is still 267,837 sacks. Detailed inventory by warehouse is listed below:</p>

<p>Yesterday, new Ke Xian rice arrivals were not abundant, but the Quanzhou traders from Fujian Province were very active in buying. Zhejiang traders and local traders also showed interest due to the high prices of foreign rice. Furthermore, transportation from producing areas such as Hunan and Jiangxi is temporarily difficult, and the Hunan provincial government is also considering direct sales to Fujian and Guangdong. Therefore, sentiment has turned positive. Before large quantities arrive, the market is expected to gradually improve, and prices have already risen by three to five fen. The total sales for the day were 272 sacks of Hunan Ji Jing rice at 6.65 yuan and 6.49 yuan, and 245 sacks of 砶 Jing rice at 6.38 yuan. 500 sacks of Nanjing Ji Xian rice were sold at prices ranging from 6.39 yuan to 6.35 yuan, all new rice, all purchased by Quanzhou traders from Fujian.</p>
<h3 id="e273">He Xia Rice Market: Arrivals and Sales Balanced <a href="#e273" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c273" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">273</a></h3>
<p>(Hu Nan) Yesterday's arrivals came from over twenty sources. The market situation was stable because arrivals and sales were balanced. The total number of sacks was seven or eight hundred. Retail demand was unchanged. Therefore, the prices of regular-grade Su rice, Tong rice, and both old and new Northern rice remained stable. Only Nan Gang thick rice was slightly softer, while Qing Jiao Gong Si thin rice, with limited supplies, remained firm. However, prices did not increase significantly, with fluctuations of only a few fen. The exchange rate was flat and weak, and the silver yuan market remained closed. Due to weather conditions, He Xia new rice is approaching the market. Dong Xin Shang Ding is being determined by factories.</p>
<p>(Hu Bei) Yesterday, He Xia rice came from twenty-seven or twenty-eight sources. Sales in the market were sluggish, with white rice high and middle-grade soft, and thin rice slightly weak. The prices of Du Jian new and old Yang Jian new and old Ke Can, Tuan Jian, Dong Xin, and other types of rice were stable. However, the prices of middle-grade new Yang Jian rice were slightly softer.</p>

<p>The miscellaneous grains market was filled with a pessimistic atmosphere. Transactions of various types were dull. The market situation showed long-term weakness and short-term firmness. Yesterday, the market sold eight or nine hundred sacks of new yellow beans and 131 carloads of old beans, with prices continuing to fall by one or two jiao. New sesame seeds remained flat and weak. Although old sesame seeds saw some sales, the market remained unfavorable. New 　 beans were firm due to the scarcity of high-quality goods, while old 　 bean prices remained unstable. Other miscellaneous grains saw no interest.</p>

<p>Yixing Autumn Cocoon Prices Surge. The autumn cocoon harvest in Yixing's various cities and villages is quite good, about 60% of a normal year. The cocoons are thick. There are over twenty cocoon dealers, mostly rented by Wuxi silk merchants. Arrivals at the market were initially very brisk, with cocoon prices reaching a maximum of 35 yuan. Farmers, noting the high price of mulberry leaves this year and the high cost of silkworm rearing, insisted on higher prices before selling. High-quality cocoons have already risen to 40 yuan.</p>
<p>Large Shipment of Sichuan Cocoons and Silk. Forever Years Wheel, a Sino-foreign company, imported the following yesterday: 281 cases of new Sichuan yellow silk and 38 cases of silk thread, all loaded in Chongqing, stored at the Pudong Hua Warehouse pending delivery.</p>
<p>Sales of Artificial Silk Continue Brisk. Merchants from Hangzhou and Shaoxing bought 58 cases of September futures of Samsung, Five-Star, Pai Da Wu, and Goldfish brands on the exchange, with prices ranging from 180.5 yuan to 169.25 yuan, net transaction.</p>
<p>European Sales of Foreign Silk Stalled. The New York and Lyon raw silk markets remained weak. Telegrams indicate that silk prices are declining further. Faced with high autumn cocoon prices and expensive silk costs, mills are unwilling to sell cheaply. In addition, the spread of labor unrest in silk factories makes the future even more pessimistic. Silk sales have completely stalled.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the foreign tea market in this port saw the start of high-grade fine needle eyebrow tea sales from Wuyuan, Tunxi, and other regions, with Tianxiang, Jinlong, Yongxing, and the China Tea Company initiating sales of high-grade fine needle eyebrow teas, with slight progress. Fine needle and pearl teas with excellent manufacturing and fine bodies also enjoyed firm sales. However, mid- and low-grade teas and ordinary fine needle eyebrows remained stagnant. The tea market is showing a trend of higher highs and lower lows.</p>

<p>Autumn is approaching, but there is still no news or demand in the black sheet iron market. Overall, the market situation is stagnant and unlikely to improve in the short term. Northern ports, such as Tianjin, Qingdao, Yantai, Beiping, and Zhangjiakou, lack demand due to tight credit or unstable conditions. Local enamel factories are saturated, so they are also buying less. The overall trend is not optimistic.</p>
<h3 id="e278">Over Two Thousand Boxes of US Tinplate Offered <a href="#e278" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c278" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">278</a></h3>
<p>Recently, with the price of US tinplate relatively cheap, trading houses and factories find it cost-effective. Therefore, over the past few days, more than 2,300 boxes have been offered. 90-pound tinplate without iron casing is offered at prices ranging from 16.35 yuan to 16.5 yuan. 90-pound tinplate with iron casing is offered at prices ranging from 16.85 yuan to 17.1 yuan. However, only over 380 boxes were traded. The prices of 180-pound and 200-pound tinplate have seen slight fluctuations, with limited transactions. 180-pound tinplate is offered at 34 yuan, and 200-pound tinplate is offered at 39 yuan. Local traders are also buying some 200-pound small and large quantities of Huisi iron at prices ranging from 31.5 yuan to 32 yuan. It is reported that the Ningbo bamboo shoot factories are asking for more information, making trading quite considerable.</p>

<h3 id="e279">About Occupation <a href="#e279" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c279" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">279</a></h3>
<p>— Du Heng</p>
<p>Because I have no occupation, as usual, having one would be a huge exception. That is to say, because there is no job to lose, I have never personally experienced the suffering of unemployment among the various pains of life. It is invisibly dispersed in the continuous struggle with poverty; when integrated into zero, one gradually gets used to it, as if this is one's duty in life. However, I do not therefore fail to express a kind of envy, or even jealousy, towards people with fixed occupations, and from this arises a kind of aversion. This is indeed a strange psychology.</p>
<p>In China today, the most stable and secure occupations are probably those eating foreign food, that is, the so-called comprador class and its subordinates. The aversion to these people stems precisely from the fact that their occupations are too stable and too secure, which is even greater than that towards other people.</p>
<p>Often, during the free time from office work, in places like the Bund, there are many well-dressed young gentlemen with newspapers, jumping on trams, not buying tickets, but indifferently saying "Season" or just gently shaking their heads to indicate an exception, and then opening small newspapers to find stimulating headlines. Whenever I see this kind of scene, I don't know why, but I say in my heart: "I hope everyone in the world has no occupation."</p>
<p>Of course, I also know that widespread unemployment is hitting our intellectual or semi-intellectual classes. Some people who want stability and security but cannot obtain them are suffering even more than long-term unemployed vagrants. They are anxious, they are scheming, they pay more attention to classified ads in newspapers than to racy social news, they beautifully say "There is no way out" everywhere, they even ask newspaper editors for "elixirs" to cure poverty. Previously, smart editors were accustomed to using knowledge, ability, and experience to perfunctorily tell you to be patient, to endure hardship, and to not hesitate to invest more capital. Whether this "elixir" is effective or not, those who have tried it naturally know, and there is no need for me to say more. Recently, the situation is different. Editors have already discovered the truth that solving the entire society is a prerequisite. But their words are too beautiful: Do not seek a way out for yourself, seek a way out for the masses. A young person who is eager to obtain immediate stability and security often only has the feeling of swallowing an empty dumpling when receiving this truth.</p>
<p>A truly promising young person, whipped by such serious life, will understand this truth sooner than a smart editor. And those friends who ask for "elixirs," once their luck shines, earning thirty or fifty taels of silver, getting a raise every year and a promotion every two years, and after thirty years, they can go home to retire and still receive silver, at that time, they will surely put on a new-fashioned gentleman's tone to demonstrate to us long-term unemployed vagrants, buy Season tickets as usual, and buy small newspapers as usual.</p>
<p>They will never think of the four words "There is no way out" again, because in their view, society is entirely stable because they have an occupation.</p>
<h3 id="e280">From "In Defense of Translation" to Lou's Translation of "European Literature in the Twentieth Century" <a href="#e280" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c280" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">280</a></h3>
<p>— Mu Mutian</p>
<p>Mr. Luo Wen, in "In Defense of Translation," said the following:</p>
<p>"If a translation is bad, most of the responsibility certainly lies with the translator, but the reading public and the publishing industry, especially critics, should also bear some of the responsibility. To remedy this decline, we must have correct criticism, pointing out the bad and rewarding the good."</p>
<p>Due to editorial work, I happened to compare Mr. Lou Jiannan's translation of "European Literature in the Twentieth Century" (New Life Publishing) with a Japanese translation. Naturally, there are many mistranslations. Because I only glanced through it, I immediately discovered the following strange phenomena.</p>
<p>On page 14, under "Maxime Du Camp" is a note: "(Maxim du Kahn)". I was very strange, because I searched everywhere, but I couldn't find this person. There is a Frenchman, Maxime du Camp, who was a friend of Flaubert. There is also a poet named Gustave Kahn, who is Jewish. "Maxim du Kahn" I don't know who this person is. I'm afraid the original name attached by Mr. Lou is fabricated.</p>
<p>On page 199, there is a statement "Among such novels, the most outstanding are the immortal works of Louis Bertrand, recently selected by the Academy (Translator: presumably referring to the Russian Communist Academy to which the author belongs)." I think the "Academie" here should refer to the French Academy. Although the Soviet Union is called a land of developed arts and culture, it would not compile a collection of imperialist writers, would it? I don't know why Mr. Lou made such indiscriminate annotations?</p>
<p>On page 223, there is "In the early twentieth century, France stepped into a new era of its history, large-scale (metallurgical) industry grew: the power of financial capital was strengthened; the ideology of imperialism was strong." At first glance. I felt quite puzzled. "France stepped into a new era of its history," what is going on? I couldn't help but look at the Japanese translation. It was not France, but France. I really don't know how Mr. Lou was so negligent, and translated it without even looking clearly at the context of the original text. This is too irresponsible.</p>
<p>On page 240, there is a book title "The Non-Burning Forest." At first glance, I also felt strange. Because I don't know, I have never heard that Romain Rolland has written that book. On closer inspection, it was originally Volume 9 of "Jean-Christophe". Its original French name is Le Buisson Ardent. "Ardent" means "burning" or "like burning". Where could I find the word "non-burning"? I thought the Japanese translation was wrong, so I checked the Japanese translation, and it turned out to be "burning again cluster". "Again" is an auxiliary verb indicating "past". It is not an auxiliary verb indicating negation and cancellation. I don't know why Mr. Lou doesn't understand this point of grammar?</p>
<p>On page 288, there is a sentence "Finally, the people delegated the words of decision." This sentence made me confused again. Looking at the original Japanese translation, it turned out to mean "Finally, entrust the words of decision to the people."</p>
<p>On page 241, there is a sentence "A seemingly new but not new intellectual class." What is the so-called "seemingly new but not new"? I doubted it. Looking at the Japanese translation, it means "a new and completely different intellectual class."</p>
<p>On page 284, there is: "I also want to speed it up," but the original meaning is: "I add a sentence." The Japanese translation of this sentence is very superficial. I don't know why Mr. Lou made such a big mistake?</p>
<p>On page 284, there is: "Our victory is the same as Caesar's destruction, vainly dreaming of enslaving one country and enslaving another country's crown prince's stove." How to explain this? I checked the Japanese translation. Then I checked Barbusse's original French text again. The French and Japanese are not very similar. According to the Japanese translation, it can be said that "Our victory is the same as destroying Caesar's | | vainly dreaming of making this nation a slave and making that nation a slave's crown prince's | | lair." I don't know why Mr. Lou translated it so strangely? This is not only not "faithful" but also not "smooth" and not "understandable" | | What is the reason?</p>
<p>The above are a few strange mistakes encountered during a casual browsing, missing some. Except for the error on page 284 at the end, which may be excusable (because the Japanese may be a bit difficult), the others should not be wrong. As long as you have studied Japanese for one or two years, you will definitely not be wrong. But Mr. Lou actually made a mistake!</p>
<p>After reading Mr. Luo Wen's article, I felt a slight sense of responsibility, | although I am not a critic | so I reported the strange phenomena I obtained from a casual browsing. I think this is beneficial for both translators and readers.</p>
<p>For the sake of a good future for the Chinese translation community, I think everyone should do this kind of inspection and criticism work. But it should be done with a calm, sincere, and friendly attitude, and should not be an attack, ridicule, or scolding.</p>
<h3 id="e281">Ma Zhiyuan's Zaju Plays <a href="#e281" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c281" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">281</a></h3>
<p>— Zheng Zhenduo</p>
<p>A few days ago, Mr. Zhao Jingshen discussed Ma Zhiyuan's zaju plays in "Free Talk"; there are two errors in the article that are worth mentioning. First, Mr. Zhao cited four short poems by Ma, thinking that they were the embryos of Ma's four plays such as "Meng Haoran Seeking Plum Blossoms in the Snow". This is a hardly believable judgment. Who knows whether Ma's short poems were written before or after the zaju plays? The expression of broad-minded world-weariness in the short poems is a common idea of ​​general Yuan qu artists; how can it be strongly pointed out that Ma first had the embryo possessed by these short poems, and then developed it into a zaju play? If this is the case, there are also quite a few poems in Yuan people's short poems that praise Chen Tuan, Meng Haoran, etc. Could they also be the embryos of Ma's zaju plays? There are the most short poems by Yuan and Ming people, singing about the stories of Cui and Zhang (Yongxi Yuefu has a hundred "Little Peach Red", singing about the affairs of the West Chamber; the "Sai Zhaoyunfei Little Songs" published during the Chenghua period also has many articles singing about the affairs of the West Chamber.) Could they also be the embryos of Wang Shifu's "Romance of the West Chamber"? I think that in studying a writer's works, except for clearly knowing the exact year in which his works were produced, it is very difficult to determine whether a certain article is the embryo of a certain work, or whether a certain work is developed from a certain article or poem; and it is even more impossible to insist that they must be the embryo of a zaju play because the short poems are short. We can only say that Ma's short poems are the same in thought as his zaju plays | | of course, they are from the same writer, and the thoughts will naturally not be very different.</p>
<p>Second, Mr. Zhao unconditionally believed in Wang Guowei's "Catalogue of Music," thinking that the play "Meng Haoran Seeking Plum Blossoms in the Snow" was written by Ma Zhiyuan. In fact, Ma had never written this play at all. We cannot find a play called "Seeking Plum Blossoms in the Snow" in Ma's repertoire in the oldest records of "Record of Ghosts" and "Taihe Zheng Yin Pu". Forcing this play to be the author of Ma's work began with Xijizi's "Selected Ancient and Modern Zaju Plays" in the Ming Dynasty. Wang Guowei added this play to Ma's works based on Xijizi's saying. It is ridiculous to say that the "Seeking Plum Blossoms in the Snow" play recorded by Xijizi was originally written by Prince Zhou Xian (Zhu You). Prince Xian's play was written in the seventh year of Xuande, with a preface explaining the purpose of writing this play in great detail, and of course it would not be a copy or adaptation of Ma's play. (Xijizi's "Selected Zaju Plays" is in the collection of the Peking Library; Zhou Xianwang's "Seeking Plum Blossoms in the Snow" can be seen in the Commercial Press edition of "Shemotuo Studio Qu Cong") We cannot know why Xijizi insisted on putting this hat on that head; could it be that he also read Ma's short poems and felt that some of the short poems were the embryos of this play? In the Ming Dynasty, such forgery of author names was commonplace, especially in sanqu and drama songs. (Fangben such as "Wu Yu Cui Ya" are the most absurd, with many errors in the author's name.) We must carefully analyze them, and we will be greatly deceived if we are not careful. Many of the errors in Wang Guowei's "Catalogue of Music" are often obtained in this way. It should not be a boring job to correct the errors of Wang and other Ming people with today's correct knowledge and compile another "General Catalogue of Chinese Opera" (there are even more errors in the "General Catalogue of Quhai" by Datong).</p>
<h3 id="e282">Woman (16) <a href="#e282" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c282" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">282</a></h3>
<p>— Shen Congwen</p>
<p>"I'm very happy. I thank you."</p>
<p>On those two sentences, I savored them for a long time, and it was precisely to put myself into all the past days.</p>
<p>After a while, the woman said:</p>
<p>"I'm also very happy."</p>
<p>"I think you are much younger, even younger than when I saw you by the sea in Shandong." "Really?"</p>
<p>"Look into my eyes, look, and you will understand how your beauty is reflected in a man's surprise!" "But you didn't in the past | never surprised by any beauty, nor surrendered by any gentleness."</p>
<p>"Did I say that?"</p>
<p>"Although I didn't say it, there are such facts."</p>
<p>He leaned closer to her, gently put his other hand on her shoulder, and brought his head close to her temple.</p>
<p>"I am very ashamed when I think of my own confusion."</p>
<p>She turned her face away, covering up her sadness, but gently said:</p>
<p>"Look, how beautiful the village below is!"</p>
<p>The man, like a child, walked in front of her, searching her face, and she lowered her head, no longer speaking. He wanted to hug her, but she ran forward. In front was the short wall of the cemetery whose surname was unknown. She stood there motionless. He rushed forward and squeezed both of her hands tightly. Face to face, neither of them had anything to say. They both seemed to be touching something, and they were speechless, unable to say anything more.</p>
<p>The woman rubbed a white hand against the man's cheek and arm, "Are you cold? It's late, let's go back." The man didn't say anything, just dragged that hand to his mouth and kissed it.</p>
<p>The two walked back silently.</p>
<p>After arriving at the hotel, the man seemed still very excited, lying on an armchair, and the woman stood beside him, with an affectionate look, putting her hand to stroke the man's forehead, and gently asked him:</p>
<p>"Are you tired? Are you dizzy?"</p>
<p>The man then raised his head and looked at the woman's white face. For the fiftieth time, he said with a stubborn and childish look: "I love you."</p>
