<p>美雖警告法仍堅持白銀問題無人重視（倫敦）世界經濟大會之局勢、絕未因羅斯福總統所發關於美元穩定問題宜愼重辦理之警告而有進步、法代表依然堅持非至通貨穩定後討論無益之説、並謂在目前環境之中、縱有减輕税則什一之具體提議、亦屬無謂云、惟最有關保之各國代表團連法國在内皆不願在事態不明晣以前批評此事、衆料羅斯福總統之警告文、僅與數字及穩定方法有關、蓋美代表團聞已接受穩定美元之原則也、前所言及之數字、（即約照現有美元四元餘合英金一鎊之價格）、在美國市場視之、認爲足以阻遏美國通貨膨漲之政策、今美總統之文、定將使美英法三國另在新基礎上商諸銀行家重開談判也、中國代表宋子文顏惠慶郭泰祺今日赴倫敦郊外休息、日本代表團今晨討論美國提議、謂須費更長久時間研究美國提議、故目前未能表示任何意見云、一九一三年充英倫銀行顧問近被任爲美國財政部顧問之史潑萊氏今日語路透訪員、謂目前穩定美元之談判方在流動狀態中、渠希望一種協定不久可成云、聞此談判之進行暫告停頓、因羅斯福總統不準備依允於通貨休戰時期中暫停其膨漲之職權也、（十八日路透電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）美總統認歐洲安定匯價提議未免過嚴、而倫敦消息他國代表對於美總統之减輕關税計劃亦覺過嚴、惟此間觀察時事者咸信、兩種不同意見當亦不難調解、</p>
<p>安定匯價計劃係美代表電達總統、大致與法財長龐萊所發表者相若、美總統未曾拒絕、但謂以此作暫時安定基礎、未免過於結晶化、其時適在總統乘車出京休夏之前、因交財部與貨幣顧問會同研究、聞其内容係由主要金融國共設一安定基金委員會、而美金與英鎊之安定價格、則與目前水平線相埒、</p>
<p>至美總統之關税提議、而美代表送達經濟委員會後、業由秘書處發表、主張延長關税休戰、各國照六月十二日通行税率普减一成、並盡力消除關税障壁、締結多面的協定、再事減輕税率、據美代表報告政府、歐洲國家大多數認立時普　關税、將使許多國家發生困難、結果成致擾亂其財政計劃、但亦有若干國家主張商訂相互辦法、以達到同樣目的、</p>
<p>至於美政府對於安定匯價意見、則欲得一相當之暫時安定辦法但頗慮一旦商定暫時穩定後、則將進而謀其永久有效、因美政府以爲非俟一切可能性悉行研究後、不能採用任何計畫、作爲永久基礎也、</p>
<p>至於白銀問題此間及倫敦俱不重視、美國產銀者、因經濟會議無意於安定匯價計畫中將白金與黃金一同考慮、頗覺失望、惟據倫敦消息、白銀問題成可另設一小組委員會考慮之云（十七日國民電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）據確息、美政府對於歐洲方面所提出之穩定幣價建議不甚滿意、今日財政部專家對該建議加以嚴密之討論、但晚間宣稱、彼等對此建議認爲不能滿意云、（十七日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）美國財政部代理部長昨日在華盛頓宣言、謂羅斯福總統在離開華盛頓休假之前、對於歐洲各國暫時穩定匯價計畫業已接獲經濟會議美國代表團之詳細報告、羅斯福答謂、美國準備聽取各項提議、但上項穩定匯價計畫未能接受、并對於美國代表團所可行使之權力加以限度、換言之、即美國對於穩定貨幣計畫未能盡皆加以同情之考慮、又謂、聯邦準備銀行總裁哈理遜並未以美國政府代表之資格赴倫敦、但與他國各中央銀行總裁會商而已、經濟會議方面對於美國接受貨幣休戰偍議之意見、原甚紛歧、故對於上項宣言、亦不十分驚異、惟倫敦若干人氏頗爲驚訝、蓋因美國代表團曾一致贊成提交羅斯福之貨幣休戰計畫、而總統則竟加以拒絕故也、法國代表團採取保留態度、俟完全明瞭羅斯福建議之正式文字後、始發表意見、今晨法國代表財長龐萊開始與美國代表團接洽、其時美國代表團方接得關於羅斯福决定之華盛頓電報、但尙未將電碼譯出、故僅獲得空泛之槪念、大槪羅斯福總統雖拒絕貨幣休戰、但其措辭不若昨日華盛頓電訊所傳之堅决、美國覆文對於所提議之措置、與其謂爲直截了當加以拒絕、毌寗謂爲主張加以修改、美國代表團宣言、謂可於下午六時向龐萊提出確實消息、（十八日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>當在華盛頓處理之决非在歐者所能爲（華盛頓）倫敦方面雖有種種傳説、但美政府仍認爲穩定美元之計畫一時無實現之可能、此間高級人員亦稱、欲美元穩定、當在華盛頓處理之、决非在歐洲者所能</p>
<p>爲也云、（十七日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）美國方面提議减税什一消息之發表、頗使美代表團爲難、美代表今日語新聞記者、謂此僅爲美國税則專家之一種建議、未必列入美國向世界經濟大會提出之正式議案云、</p>
<h3 id="c16">美國建議内容 <a href="#c16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>减税什一延長關税休戰訂立協定安定國際貿易（倫敦）世界經濟大會今日最重要事件、爲美代表團之向經濟委員會提出建議、其要點爲進口税減少什一、修正進口限制、與延長關税休戰時期其細則如下、（一）從一九三三年六月十二日起、各國現有進口税、普減去百分之十、而附税及其他專徵於進口貨者、一槪同樣減少、</p>
<p>（二）對於輸入國以外給予任何來源出品現行優待税則差額、酌予減少、</p>

<h3 id="c18">復興淞滬與復興農村信 <a href="#c18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>閘北在十里洋塲之上海市。原爲一繁盛區域。沿淞滬路以至吳淞一帶。匪特風景淸幽。而且工廠林立。江灣附近。更有成爲文化區之希望。吳淞雖非工商業要區。但其向上發展之趨勢。亦十分顯明。再經數十年。其足以延長上海之繁榮。自無疑義。乃不幸經一九三二年一二八之事變。閘北僅餘一片瓦礫。</p>
<p>吳淞亦成灰燼。撫膺往昔。良用慨然。凡我國民。有志於復興中國民族者。即無不希望我淞滬之先恢復繁榮。蓋一方所以謀我工商業之發展。樹立建設之基礎。一方亦即所以表示我民族。終欲以自己之强力。開自己未來之新路。</p>
<p>言復興淞滬之方法。可分爲二。在消極方面。上海雖較其他城市爲富厚。且爲長江沿岸出產物品之總輸出海口。一般政治。自當較内地爲超越。爲更有條理。然而初經大難。瘡痍未平。不僅勤苦大衆之經濟力。因軍事而遭嚴重之打擊。即中等以上之資產家。亦不免蒙受巨大損失。一時實不易恢復原狀。故恢復淞滬繁榮之初步工作。如如何維持社會之治安。如何予工商業以便利。如何次第整理交通。當局雖已力盡人事。務使人民得安其居。而以經濟力凋敝之故。尙未能臻於樂業蓋海上一般風習。多趨於取巧投機。以圖個人生活上之安適。而絕鮮努力於公衆久遠之計劃。一經大難。自然更爲渙散。能力自益薄弱。此恢復繁榮不易之一因也。</p>
<p>今後復興淞滬之道。當然不僅應努力於消極的工作。暫維現狀且應積極開發。當前急務。第一在求工業上進展。第二在商業之重新。茲二事者孰不能知。亦孰不能言。徒以内因盜匪縱橫。雖有精良製造品而無地可銷。外因國際間工商業競爭之激烈。後進國家之製造品。人工雖極低廉原料雖極便宜但以管理欠週詳。器械不精密。已難與外商競勝。况復海外無可開拓之市塲。内地乏購賣之能力。現存工業。且因受種種威脅而感生存之非易。自無暇　於遠大之企圖矣。然而我中國。究與歐美不同。迄今就整個中國言。尙多可以開發之地。到處可覔生機。設欲認眞努力。於恢復城市繁榮而外。同時應力謀農村之復興。農村事業能得發展。工商業自易興起。城市之繁榮。方可鞏固此又言復興者所應注意者也。</p>
<p>我國原爲農業國家。現在資本主義組織之經營。在各大都市。亦僅略具雛形。其對外輸出物品中大都爲原料。而原料品中如大豆·如皮革·如生絲·如茶葉·成爲直接之農業生產物。或爲其副產物。皆由於農業關係而來。就輸入物品之消費論。其去處亦多在農村及接近農村之小城市。在歐洲在北美。農業恐慌。顯已影響於整個的國民經濟矧我農村衰落至於如此則城市又焉能發達。所謂繁榮。直等於無源之水。無皮之毛。故我國今日根本之病源厥。在農村。不過政治而不先刷新。則對農村之復興。自多阻害此又爲當局所應知者。一般人顧念淞繁榮。籌劃種種繁榮方策。細按實效大都屬於一時之刺激性者多。屬於刺激。縱能繁榮於一時。而事過境遷便又消散淞滬之市面衰頽。依然如故。故今後欲　上海市面之繁榮。重整閘北之旗鼓。　摒除一時刺激之作用。而極力從事於根本之國。農業復興然。後全國經濟。乃能活潑。國民經濟。用具基礎。大都市之殘破。乃得重新。而繁榮始能確保也。</p>

<p>希特勒在野的時候、曾標榜所謂打倒利息奴隷制度等類經濟政策、自從國家社會黨組織内閣以來、實際施行的經濟政策、并不是他作在野黨時所宣傳的、而是前届内閣巴本的經濟政策、至於貫串他全政策的「劃一化」據希特勒自己説、「劃一化」的槪念、不是封建主義槪念、而是「能率」第一的槪念、即是把一般工作能率提到最高、在政治上所表現的是極端中央集權的獨裁政治、這種政治、在旁的國家、是缺乏歷史的淵源、是難於充分發展的、然而德國受過長期的軍國主義的薰陶、戰後又備受戰勝國的凡爾賽和約壓迫、所以反響很厲害、特别是中層階級的羣衆、旣受富豪的逼迫、又感外力的强制、因此羣起而爲國社黨的後援、并且普魯士的大地主、也感着自身的困難、重工業資本家、也以爲外國資本可怕、於是發揮他們軍國主義的勇敢而自求獨立、凡是一切國家的·經濟的·政治的設施、都用「劃一化」的招牌、實行中央集權的獨裁、例如希特勒政府成立之後、竟至於廢止各聯邦政府的政治上的權能、而代以類似縣政府的辦法、用中央政府代表委員去行使這種職權、則無論實質上或是表面上都實現了獨裁的形式、</p>
<p>在經濟方面、通德意志全國各產業部門、都實行其所謂統制政策、由國社黨一力包辦、紅色的活動、當然變成了完全的地下黨、雖然在工人羣衆當中、還有不可輕侮的潛勢力、不過因爲他們自從威馬爾憲法頒布以來、作慣了合法黨、現時突然受着這樣强烈的政治上壓迫、自必一時喘不過氣來、事實上非特紅色活動如此、即是由革命而轉向於社會政策的社會民主黨底下的工會事務所、亦於前日（五月二日）被國社黨占領、工會的幹部、一齊旔被捕工會的財產、都被没收、今後將由國社黨出來指揮工會活動、不消説凡是没收的紅色工會和黃色工會的財產、都變成國家社會黨的財產了、</p>
<p>希特勒政府爲了要實行經濟界的劃一化起見、對於各產業部門、都由政府委任一個統監下去、説是要改善產業組織、事實上的表現、所謂保護工商業政策、乃是由中央銀行低利放欵、例如最近關於修理工廠建築物、預備放出一萬萬馬克、保護手工業支出一千五百萬馬克、而與現在農業部部長胡根堡有特殊關係的油和脂肪工業、要實行獨占、就給與很大的補助金、</p>
<p>又説是爲要保護中小商業、把從前對一般商店抽收的税金、都對百貨商店課税、誰都知道這是把負担轉嫁到消費者身上去、但是家宅及土地所有者的賦税减輕法、本來今年停止的、却又延長一年、至於解决失業問題、是以驅逐猶太人補用德國人爲唯一的方法、至於外國人、當然更没有在德國找工作的機會了、然而失業人數、在四月間還是有五百五十萬以上、</p>
<p>希特勒政府的經濟政策、成績到底何如、最容易明白表現出來莫過於輸入貿易的數字、可是希特勒對於貿易、是主張極端保護貿易主義的、所以凡是一切對外通商互惠條約、設使期滿、即行廢止、以便他實行增加關税、所以德法貿易附加協定滿期之後、法國商品輸入德國、立行增加關税、對南斯拉夫的食品輸入、也是加税、這樣子增加關税之後、當然會引起對本國的報復、於是德國對外貿易、無論是輸入或者是輸出、最近來的統計數字、都表示減低、工業製造品减低、也許是一種好現象、食料品減低、就未見得是德國人民之福、原料品的保持原來的數字、是與德國有若干利益的、然而在輸出方面、却很値得注意、因爲德國是一個靠貿易輸出來培殖市面繁榮的國家、本年一月至三月三個月間、其輸出超過總數、不過一億零五百萬馬克、而去年九月至十二月三個月期間、其輸出超過總額有二億三千四百萬馬克、與今年春季比較起來、竟多了二分之一以上、則貿易前途悲觀成分居多、國社黨經濟政策的效能、於此也可以窺見一般了、（一九三三·五·五日於柏林）</p>

<p>第一節官署之歷史我國有醫藥行政的歷史甚古。最早要算周禮上的醫官。但是此後却不見典籍了。此後祇有所謂太醫院。乃是皇家御用醫者的聚集所在。却並不是管理全國醫政。顧全人民疾苦。整理全國醫藥的機關。近數十年來。因歐風東漸。才有官廳治理醫藥的事實。　在光緒己亥庚子之交。江寗府知府柯逢時。在南京主張考騐中西醫。應考的中醫有七百餘人。祗取了一百多人。西醫四十餘人。祇取了十餘人。此可謂衛生法令的嚆矢。當時官中命令。要比現在强得多。倘若就從此時嚴厲執行。那麽如今的醫界。也不致混亂到此地步。可惜柯先生也是曲高和寡。没有其他的人去輔助他。直到他去官以後。繼任的守着因時制宜的妙語。又把這件事耽擱下了。此後到了端午橋做江蘇巡撫。也曾提倡考試蘇州府的醫生。並且他還制定了醫家診例。每次祗許收洋二元。更責令醫生不許坐轎。只許騎驢。以求迅速。思想固然新頴。但是未免持之過急。所以當時蘇州某老先生。即因爲曾任御醫。恥受甄别。寗可避地到上海小住。待等端方去任。然後回里。足見我國醫界。本不易治。到了民國二三年。北京内政部特設衛生司。首先在北京試辦各項衛生行政。兼管全國醫藥事業。這醫師兩字的名稱。還是從這時候產生。（按這個名詞倒是從古書上有所本。並不是抄襲律師的對象）。此後各大都市的警廳。皆設有衛生科。由衛生科。又成立了衛生局。上海北京。要算最早。直到北伐完成。定都南京。本着先總理的建國大綱。才又成立了衛生部。當時全國醫藥界。欣然走告。覺得衛生旣有專部行政。醫藥界雖受統轄。亦多保障。想不到國情日非。衛生部的部大務小。只得改爲了衛生署。那就是現在的衛生署了。然而因部改署。似乎政權又縮小了。目今的現象。中央只呌衛生部管些「點綴衛生」。管些「洋務醫藥。」而衛生部也呌没法。然而與我上面所述的施政初衷。已屬不相符合。要講到與先總理的遺志。更覺相去太遠了罷。</p>
<h3 id="c202">寸口診脈的討論 <a href="#c202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>— 余雲岫</p>
<p>在解剖學已經明瞭的今日，對於手腕橈骨側一條動脈，也應該認識他的正身，了解他的性質。解剖模型，各處敎育儀器商店都有陳列，生理學科，全國中等學校也有敎課，我以爲至少限度，曾經受了中等敎育以上的人，理應該曉得橈骨動脈的來歷和作用。何以現在舊醫診病的時候，儼然伸着三指，按在病人橈骨動脈之上，裝出一種凝神壹志神氣，似乎可以洞知　結，還在脈案上公然寫出肝脈腎脈等話。若説是不知妄説，何以無人駁斥？若說是欺詐行爲，何以無人干涉？從此可知國人的腦筋裏，完全没有實事求是的思想，澈底研究的耐力，都是糢糢糊糊，（近來寫作馬馬虎虎）且過今日，那管明朝的態度。所以弄得全國上下，只講利害，不論是非，只顧私人，不管國事，實在是可痛心的呀！現在用「採科學方式整理國醫」的國醫館，他所制定的國醫條例，還是注重脈象，不顧一切，這不是發昏麽？</p>
<p>我在拙著醫學革命論集卷四，曾發表一篇「與中醫學會論脈書，」現在我把駁斥舊醫脈學的十一個大理由，演成通俗語體，來和全國曾受中等敎育以上的國人，討論一下。</p>
<p>（一）脈的正身是什麽東西？</p>
<p>動脈都是從心藏左室出來，隨地隨處，分發椏枝，網絡全身，他的内面是空的，好像一條橡皮管，他的用處，是灌輸動脈血到全身組織上去，分給榮養物，心藏一跳動，把左心室的血液，逼出到動脈裏面去，動脈也就一跳動，把動脈裏面的血液，向前逼進一步，似此一跳兩跳，繼續下去，就把動脈血周流到全身去了。橈骨動脈，就是千百個椏枝中的一個，並没有什麽特别，不過他經過寸口地方，比較的和皮下相接近，容易摸得着就是了。他的跳動，就是跟着心的跳動而生，脈速，就是心跳速；脈遲，就是心跳遲；脈規則不規則，就是心跳規則不規則；和全身動脈，絕對没有兩樣，這是很顯明的事實，並且是容易明白的道理。現在舊醫們偏把寸口的動脈，當做手太陰肺經的脈，並且説是百脈之所朝宗，並且説可以處百病，可以决死生，明明是閉着眼的瞎説，請國人留心追究一下，就可以明白他們的錯誤了。</p>
<p>（二）單診寸口的脈法，是什麽人開始主張的？</p>
<p>現在舊醫所奉爲金科玉律的書，就是黃帝的素問，和張仲景的傷寒論，素問裏面的脈法，只有三部九候和人迎氣口兩種，其三部九候的法，是上至於頭，下至於足，都是有動脈可診，明明白白載在素問三部九候篇，絕對没有敎人只診寸口動脈的話兒。其人迎氣口，是喉兩旁的動脈呌做人迎，左右兩寸口的動脈呌做氣口，是同時並診，兩相比較的方法，也絕對没有敎人只診寸口動脈的話兒。至於張仲景的傷寒論，他常常説寸口跌陽，跌陽在什麽地方，學者意見頗有不同，這是另一個問題。但是可以證明仲景不是只診寸口動脈的，而且傷寒論自序裏面，也很説坐持寸口的醜話，更可以見得仲景是反對只診寸口動脈的人，後來楊上善等，對於寸口脈法，也表示不滿足，可見得寸口診脈的法兒，在漢魏六朝的時候，不是正法，一班學者，都看他不起，但是他的起原，却是在於難經，在漢魏六朝時候，也有人用寸口診脈的法兒，去診察病人。因爲一班學者，都看他不起，所以不得大流行。後來，男女禮節，越發嚴重，摸頭摸脚，實在老大不便，凑巧有只診寸口的法兒，只要摸摸手就算了，豈不是簡便呢，於是乎他的法兒，就漸漸盛行起來了。這是當時江湖醫生苟且變通迎合社會的勾當，並不是古來相傳的正派法兒。現在舊醫，却把他當做聖經賢傳似的，深信奉行起來，只顧便利，不去飲水思源，我要請國人把專診寸口脈法的歷史，窮究一下，就可以曉得現在國醫們的診脈法，是江湖上因陋就簡的方術，眞是一錢不値，並不是什麽古聖賢系統相傳的金科玉律呵。（未完）</p>

<p>— 胡嘉言</p>
<p>「癱癆鼓膈，是四個不治的重症；」這句話差不多没有一個人不曉得的。在作者幼年時候，就聽見長輩時常這樣的説，到了醫學校快畢業了，又遇着親友屢次來問起，這四大病你們究竟有新的治法没有呢？我覺得回答這問題决不是是否一個字即可包括的，因爲我國素來的名詞都太嫌抽象，病名也不外　例。即如這四種病，除去「癆」代表我們的「結核病」狹義的説即肺結核，還是一種病名外：像另外三種，癱係風癱的簡稱，含有麻痺不仁半身不遂的意義；鼓即鼓脹，和我們所説的腹水是一樣，但如腹内積有氣體，腹部澎脹，（尋常喚作）</p>
<h3 id="c204">科學的達生篇（二十） <a href="#c204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>— 俞松筠</p>
<p>（十六）身體的安靜</p>
<p>（甲）產後的睡眠產婦在產褥期的臥室，最好寛廣幽靜，空氣流通，室内温度，宜在攝氏十八度左右，日光換氣，不可直接，室内除醫師助產士或護士外，務宜限制出入，以期淸潔，而達肅靜，此時產婦的精神，極易感動，無論喜怒哀樂，愼勿使之稍有感觸，所以在分娩後二三日内，務使晝夜安睡，以便心身靜逸，見聞不亂，切勿任意起立行動，以免發熱出血之危，本身和家族，都應充分注意。</p>
<p>（乙）分娩後十日間的心得</p>
<p>分娩後就床的時期，從前的人，以爲三個星期已夠休養，但在實際上欲得產後的充分休養，須在六個星期以内爲度，因爲起立太早，則有種種害處，例如出血量多，易患發熱，而且子宫位置及形狀，容易變化，並有血拴血塞之危。</p>
<p>心身怎樣才可安靜，就在產後十日間的心得，可以知道，因爲產褥生活，就是重病人的生活，所以需要安靜，達於極點，一切床外行動，應該在可能時期以後，徐徐應付爲宜，今述心得如下</p>
<p>（一）頭二天須仰臥，分娩方畢之後，絕對需要安靜，已如上述，頭二天產婦應該仰臥，以免空氣侵入子宫，對於飲食排便，均應在床上爲之，切不可起立如厠。</p>
<p>（三）三日後可側臥，第三日飲食授乳，可以自由側臥，第四日可以隨意掉換睡眠的方向，假使固定偏於一側，那末，要使子宫的位置發生惡化，又如仰臥太久，就有子宫後屈的起因，所以最好左右各側，隨時互易。</p>
<p>（二）五日後可起坐，五六日以後，對於授乳排便飲食等事，可以隨便起坐，但仍不可離床否則，離床太早，難免發熱或出血之危。</p>
<p>（四）十日後可稍動，十日後或兩星期後，如果子宫收縮佳良，惡露正常，可以稍稍起立，但仍以在床之時較多爲宜，大抵至少須在三個星期以後，方可正式離床，六個星期以内，初勿操勞過度。</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>（氣鼓）也包括在内的；膈即膈氣，病者食物　下障碍，多以饖餓致死。這三種解釋，大槪不至和尋常一般人所説的相違罷？但歸根到底，完全是病的一種症象，决不能當作病名。譬如就風癱來説，係腦出血脊髓癆脊髓炎都可以算數，甚至脚氣病有時完全不能行動，也未嘗不好算入；肝硬變以及心臟腎臟病固然是鼓脹。即結核性腹膜炎也是一樣的。根據這一點，馬上答覆能治或不能治是不可能的。我現在且將在此種症象下可能的病症一一的分類詳述，同時對於豫後療治，以及每稱中症象不同之點，也有相當的指出。我覺得像這樣叙述，纔算是有系統的回答，關於癆即信核，已可算一專病名，本篇中放在末章叙述。</p>
<p>（一）風癱一般人所認爲的風癱症，在新醫一方面，可能的病症確實不少；尤以脊髓一方面最多。其中比較重要而習見的，像腦出血，脊髓癆，脊髓炎，多發性腦脊髓硬化，脊髓性麻痺，痙攣性脊髓麻痺，急性上行性脊髓麻痺，進行性麻痺，等症都是。此外像軟骨症，脚氣病，歇司得里病，有時也有類似風癱的情形。關於此中症狀以及豫後之如何，我現在且將上面所舉出的一一分述於下面：</p>
<p>（一）腦出血本病一般人喚作「中風」，或作「卒中」，腦病之一。主因係由腦動脈病變而破裂，病者卒然不省人事而昏睡卒倒，此時除呼吸及心跳動外，幾與死人一樣。顏面潮紅，脈搏慢，呼吸疾速不正，體温下降，運動知覺及反射幾俱廢絕。病劇者往往即致於死亡。但如病灶收縮，崩壞之内容漸漸吸收，則患者自醒而恢復。但復發以至數發而致死者也不少。本病患者醒後恢復原狀與否？和他出血所在點關係狠大。假使出血在内囊附近，則他半側運動麻痺，所謂「腦性偏癱」是。此是顏面神經舌下神經和四肢都被波及，下肢較上肢尤顯著，這樣情形，有時可慢慢恢復的，但不易治愈者佔大多數。本症誘因，大半是動脈變硬，所以患者以老人爲多壯年中年患者則犬半由於梅毒損害動脈而致；此外酒精及鉛中毒亦爲誘因之一。治療；無固定特效法。以靜脈瀉血法較重要，患者往往因此而醒；患者頭部置冰囊，碘劑注射品可用，惟一切强心劑注射須禁止。</p>
<p>（二）脊髓癆本病解剖變化在脊髓後索，狹小扁平，呈灰白色變性；大半係患梅毒後而發生。病者初起時在腿部發生疼痛，性如雷擊，與神經痛相似；此外則瞳孔縮小，現反射强直性；膝蓋骨反射消失。此時胃部現不快狀，膀胱直腸機能障害，視神經萎縮，此種情形經過，自數週至數年不等，名曰神經痛期。嗣後病者漸於下肢發生共同機變調之症，步行時以踵投地而闊步，呈滿跚狀，如步行一直線上，則拙劣至不能旋轉身體；甚者如使病者閉目並足直立，則身體動搖，呈顚倒狀。此經遇期亦可至數年，名曰共同機變調期。末後則病者不能步行，困頓床褥，足部咸不動狀萎縮，問發生膀胱炎膀胱麻痺等症，所謂截癱期是也。前後經過可至數十年之久。治療除專門治療梅毒外，其他可助處殊鮮。</p>
<p>（三）脊髓炎本病大半因急性傳染病後而發生。初起時即呈慢性者，則由於梅毒及多發性腦脊髓硬化症關係。其解剖變化，多發於脊髓，灰白質。初起時突然戰慓，發高熱，脊柱强直威覺，下肢知覺異常，於短時陷於完全麻痺，成截癱狀。此外則現膀胱直腸麻痺，因誘發膀胱炎腎盂炎而致死。本病因病灶所在點之不同，故有胸脊髓炎，腰脊髓炎，頸脊髓炎之分。其症象亦因之而異同。其病灶在頸髓腰髓二部者，因呼吸中樞及膀胱直腸中樞易被侵襲，豫後殊不良。慢性者經過自數年至數十年之久，但亦無全愈之望。治療：有梅毒者行專門療法：其他則發汗劑，電氣療法，内服水楊酸及　劑。急性本病退熱劑亦可用。</p>
<p>（四）多發性腦脊髓硬化症本病患者以壯年者爲多，老人較少。凡急性傳染病以及酒精鉛水銀中毒均可誘發此病。但與梅毒無關。其硬化病灶羅列於全神經系統，大小不等，以脊髓爲多，大腦末梢神經次之。本症初起時，時發頭痛眩暈神經痛等前驅症；其本病固有症象，爲運動障害，運動震顫，眼球震顫，視力障害，分節言語，膀胱直腸營養精神障礙諸狀態。關於運動障害，由於身體各筋肉之萎縮或强直，以下肢爲甚，成共同機障害，與脊髓癆相似。本症發完全痺麻絕少，但如脊髓或腦部之偏側侵襲時，則現半身不遂狀態，與上述諸症一樣。本症直接發生生命危險較少，但實爲不治之症，治療無特效療法，注射Fibrolysin較有效。</p>

<p>— 瞿紹衡</p>
<p>楊宗訓君問舊式偵查女子之貞潔與否。恒視其新婚第一夜有新紅與否爲準。此種偵察法近世多有非之者。不知實際上究竟有無錯誤。</p>
<p>答以女子新婚有無落紅而斷其貞操。中外古今。莫不如是。廣東鄉俗。於賓客滿堂之際。新夫婦即入洞房。初交見血。即出示衆。羣客稱賀。燕俗結婚之翌日。亦以褻巾往女宅報信。謂之報喜。設無喜可報。則女宅家人竟不敢涉足男宅。此等舉動。俚鄙可笑。去近世學理太遠。不可爲訓。按落紅原因爲處女膜破裂所致。然此膜有先天性完全缺如者。紹衡固嘗見之。成書亦皆明載。且以新醫之考據言。處女膜破裂原因。不僅限於交媾故。以此條件而受屈之女子。世不乏人。此則提倡女權者所應注意者也。</p>
<p>問處女膜破裂是否爲致血之由。答處女膜在解剖學上爲一層薄膜。障陰道口。有相當伸縮力。且膜上本有不定形之孔隙。孔之大小先天各異。然大都不容成人之具。故初次交媾必受裂傷而致流血。流血之程度目以裂傷之大小爲準。更因膜質厚薄。組織靭度。孔隙大小。陽具形態。舉動緩急。而裂傷之大小亦各異。</p>
<p>問舊式女子新婚無血可否據爲不貞之明證。</p>
<p>答明乎上述二答案。當即不可一筆抺煞。據余個人意見。欲偵知處女膜是否完全。除由醫師將處女檢查外更無他法。然此法於習慣上已不可能。而况處女膜之柔靭者。往往雖經交媾亦有未裂者。甚有經過五個月之小產而仍完全不破者。是則更無足憑矣。</p>
<p>問處女膜破裂除交媾外尙有其他原因否。</p>
<p>答處女膜破裂。原因至多。如手淫。月經。外傷激　摩擦及婦科手術等皆是也。</p>
<p>問偵查女子貞潔與否。除流血一項而外。尙有其他方法否。</p>
<p>答已如上述。然非妥善之法。</p>
<p>問處女膜之組織如何。</p>
<p>答處女膜乃由陰道後壁發端之環狀粘膜縐襞。位於陰道外口。膜上有形狀不同。大小不一。數目不定之小孔。亦有絕對無孔者。謂之處女膜閉鎖。非生理現象也。此外尙有血管增多。及結締組織增多之症。亦皆非正常身體所應有。</p>
<p>問處女破瓜有無疼痛者否。其程度是否以年齡成比例。</p>
<p>答旣明乎上述之處女膜本身地位組織及破裂之程度。各有不同。則此條問題。亦即思過半矣。</p>
<p>問子宫病可使處女膜破裂否。</p>
<p>答因子宫病而間接使處女膜容易破裂則有之。直接之破裂則無之。因白帶浸淫釀成陰門瘙癢症。而由摩擦損傷者則有之。因子宫病受手術而破裂者。則又當别論矣。</p>

<p>— 花鈴</p>
<p>據研究生物學者説，人類的祖宗萬代，是四足着地，穴居野處，茹毛飲血，徧體生毛的老畜生。中間經了十萬八千年，一世世的傳下去，居然把二個前蹄變成了手，二條後腿，　得站起來走路，於是，呵呵，逐漸地像一個人了。</p>
<p>人旣生了二隻手，能耐可就比畜生大了。穴居野處的生活，覺得不舒服，於是用手起造茅屋，更進而爲　　船，一直至於十八層大厦。茹毛飲血的吃喝不適口，於是用手烹而飪之，油鹽醬醋，再加大蒜葱　，一直至於五香味之素，美味辣醬油。</p>
<p>手的功用，不只會造屋與烹飪，簡直是萬能的。以普通的説，手會得拍馬，會得撈錢，此外如提拔人，搶飯碗，殺人放火，敲詐勒索，撥算盤，數鈔票，更没一件不是要上下其手。這種遮天的本領，我們四足着地的老祖宗，是夢想不到的。</p>
<p>人生二手，除了上述一切外，還會偷偷摸摸的勾當，普通呌做三隻手。這不過是一句笑話罷了，人怎麽會有三隻手。但是據生物學家説，人身上器官肢體的生成，各有其用的。若是某一部分没用了，便會退化掉，或形成有用的器官。現在科學發達，代步的東西，日漸進步，足的功用，逐漸减少，將來準會有一天没足的人，八天之内，還游地球。同時因手的需要日廣，而現在的二足，也都形成爲手。所以大家不要見了三隻手納罕，將來人類是會進化到四隻手呢。</p>
<p>但是我希望這位生物學家的進化論，幸而言不中，因爲人類僅有二隻手，大家已經搶不到麵包，若一變爲四隻手，還有命麽？</p>

<p>其實上海所有建築物，一門一户，大半没有門檻這件東西：偶然見到有門檻的房屋，總是不合時宜，成了都市觀瞻上的汚點：門檻一語，却無盛行推廣的必要，幸有聰敏的上海人，拿藝術二字出來代替，門檻一語，恐將變爲歷史的陳物了：在下的故鄉，畢竟民風純樸，事事脚踏實地，這門檻的解釋，便大大的不同：譬如一位少女，有好事者出而作伐，要討喫一杯喜酒，當事人的父母，必定要「一本正經」向媒老爺説：我們是有門檻的人家，請你要注意對方的門户，一面表示他閨闥森　，不肯輕易配偶：一面表示目前没有門檻不規矩的女子多。</p>
<p>可憐我們大中華民國，原是幾十年的詩禮之家，一向左鄰右舍都看得起是有門檻的高第；如今門户洞開，自從九一八以後，　寗·吉林·黑龍江·熱河·山海關，一座一座的大門·儀門·腰門·屏門；盡陷敵手，給强宼據爲已有，變做一個没有門檻的人家。</p>
<p>雖然「牆高萬丈，擋的不來之人；」跳樑小醜，從你門檻下竄進，而看門的人，竟不知道門檻的要緊？任他竄進，這眞是意想不到的一會事；家主婆運足了一面抵抗一面交涉的門檻，依舊打不退敵人的野心，恐怕要終歸變做没有門檻的人家了？荀子議兵篇上面説：「兼並，易能也；惟堅凝之難焉。」凝，定也；堅，自然是强了，我們現在不强不定，所以要門檻被奪，如今家主婆打着「攘外必先安内」的口號，大槪便是這個怠思吧？</p>

<p>生庫中的　奉先生們正　是起了面孔，擺起了架子大殺其窮鬼的時期。高牆頭外，和尙頭屏風之間，小包裏夾在腋下的朋友陸續於道，進出如梭，朝奉先生們運用其銅鈴般的目，資本家身份的口吻，立在高櫃毫外面的祇管吃着冰泠的彈頭。</p>
<p>一年四季之中，夏是無產階級的人們所最認爲可愛的。雖然有錢的有閒階級還要設法去避，但是窮苦的貧民祇希望一年三百六十五日天天是夏季，那裏要避呢？當然貧富的生活雖然同樣是人間，而其間是絕對分離在二個世界之内的。夏季的貧民身上祗需要一件單衣，冬天的棉襖棉被都可以跳過高牆頭裏去，寄在這長生庫中了。何等的爽快？</p>
<p>每到冬天降臨到人間，西北風呼呼的時候，摩登姑娘們就是出風頭的時候，皮大衣的領頭露出在外面西北風中，不是出風頭嗎？可是窮朋友的眉頭正在蹙緊呢。少不得東拚西凑，到長生庫中去贖出棉衣來。於是高牆頭外，和尙頭屏風之間，小包裏夾在腋下的朋友又復陸續於道，進出如梭。朝奉先生們運用其十三檔的算盤，少不得削去了窮鬼手中的袁頭上面一條邊。高櫃臺外面的唯有俯首而如命。</p>
<p>冬去了夏來，夏去了冬又來。冬天來了，窮朋友蹙着眉跑進高牆，夏來了窮朋友展開了眉頭跑進高牆，一年一年從冬到夏從夏到冬川流不息，窮朋友們的小包裏也川流不息的跳躍在長生庫之間夏天，是長生庫中的忙碌時期，同時冬天，又是長生庫中的忙碌時期。都市中的長生庫，一年有二個忙碌時期。</p>

<p>— 張恨水</p>
<p>第九回謔語豈無由東床暗引突來良有以西席閑籌</p>
<p>江氏回頭望了一望，笑道：多謝您費心，我也就是爲了我們姑娘難説話，老是拿不定主意。曼英道；我看他没有什麽不願意的了，恭喜你呀！説着，他笑嘻嘻的走了。他們這樣鬼鬼祟祟的作法，桂枝何嘗不知道？不過他以前有個甘二爺橫在心裏，就覺得世界上没有第二個人可以讓他看進眼裏。現在甘二爺不知所之了，打破了他迷信白面書生的主義。他雖覺得趙連長不是自己心裏所最喜歡的男子，然而並没有第二個人再賽過他的了。他那誠懇的行爲，和靄的態度，都可以説，比白面書生還好。若是公然的説不嫁趙自强，這在自己心裏，很覺有些説不過去，所以他心裏雖是委决不下來，可是只管委决不下來，明知道趙家在極力的託人作媒，然而却不好意思説出來自己不嫁他。這樣的過了一天，又過了一天，混混的就是一個星期之久。這日上午，天氣很好，旣没有風沙，又不冷，桂枝閑閑的靠了大門框站定，眼光注視着甘家的大門，不覺得在心裏頭翻起陳賬來，記起從前的那些經過，心裏想着，究竟還是守舊的女子好，假如我是個文明女子，積之認識我這久，他要我怎樣，我就怎樣，必定要上他一回大當。男子們原來都是這樣靠不住的。他還約我等三年呢，就是三個月，他也不用我等呢。正如此想着，趙連長手上提了一串猪肉，走了回來。他低了頭在那裏瞳着，似乎在想着什麽心事。偶然一抬頭，看見了桂枝，忽然頓了一頓，站住没有動。桂枝猛然想起這幾日事情的發生，不覺臉上一紅，轉身就想跑。這樣想着時，身子一扭，可是他第二個感想，又跟着來了。若是掉轉身子一跑，這不是明明的表示着，自己是知道最近這一件事情的嗎？因之立刻站定了，並不走開，等着趙自强走了過來，就向他笑道：趙連長回來了。（一○四）</p>

<h3 id="c218">化妝品的來源 <a href="#c218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>假使我對你説：你司愛的嘴唇上，塗的是煤之提鋉物；你嬌艷的面頰上，搽的是已死的蟲；你的眉毛上，畫的是燒焦的骨頭；你的指甲上，塗的是浸融的棉花；那麽你一定要把我當作瘋予看待，所以這樣荒謬絕倫的話。其實這些話不但不錯，而且非常科學化的；因爲你天天要用的種種化妝品，大部分是靠了化學的技巧，才有這樣奇妙的功用。那麽欲把它的眞面目揭示出來，把它的來源告訴大衆，除了上述的幾句徹底話以外，眞是無話可説了。假使你還不相信，請看下文：</p>
<p>祗要你有機會走進一家專門製造油漆顏料化妝物品的大工廠，你便可看見一種鮮艷的紅色顏料，是從一種臙脂蟲製取的。這種蟲捉得後，裝入袋中，把它炕死。製成的顏料就呌洋紅，一作油漆用，一作臙脂用。那麽説一句歸根結底的話，你臉上搽的不是已死的蟲兒嗎？</p>
<p>還有一種紅色顏料，呌做Ｅｏｓｉｎ，是從煤焦油中提鍊出來的。摩登姑娘一日不可無的「點唇膏」，有時也用這樣出產品來配成的。有一種東西呌做象牙黑，是把象牙燒成焦炭，然後製成的，普通是用其他動物的骨頭燒焦而製成的。這樣黑色東西，是畫眉毛用的。至於塗在指甲上的「美指液」，就是Ｃｅｌｌｕｌｏｓｅ（　維素），是把棉花浸在一種酸中而製成的。那麽你不是把燒焦的骨頭畫眉毛，把浸融的棉花塗指甲嗎？</p>
<h3 id="c219">草莓與美容 <a href="#c219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>— 佩萸</p>
<p>祇要有多量的草莓，便可不買臙脂和唇膏；因爲草莓是一種夏季最經濟的美容品，對於婦女的美容術，大有帮助的。假使用了草莓作夏季的美容品，一定可使姿色紅潤嬌艷，皮膚白嫰細膩，人們見了都要問你一聲：「你有什麽美容的秘方啊！」</p>
<p>假使你喜歡吃的話，不妨儘量的吃草莓。吃了不但有淸身心潔體質的功效，而且可以使你容貎秀麗。要知道將患濕疹的人，才想避免草莓的。多油的皮膚，也可用草莓來調治的。只要用少許草莓放在盆裏搗榨，在榨出的汁液中，浸入一塊爛布，用時把這浸透草莓汁的布，揩擦皮膚，隔半小時後，再用一塊在滴有半茶匙稀淡安息香藥水的熱水浸濕的面巾來洗去，這樣便可使皮膚改造了。有草莓的時候，可以配製，每星期以此揩擦一次，卽能見效。</p>
<p>假使你面孔上有雀斑，有曬黑的皮色，毋須出重價去購除斑藥白面散，只要每天把草莓汁搽塗兩三次，便可消除。這並不是法國美女的除斑秘方啊。假便你年紀大了，要找一種驻顏術，那麽也可惜重草莓。歷史告訴我們：著名的美婦戴林太太Ｍａｄａｍｅ　Ｔａｌｌｉｅｎ常用草莓洗浴的，就是在洗浴的水中，放人二十磅的草莓和二磅已榨的木莓。</p>
<p>假使你塗在指甲上的美指液用完了，不必懊喪，也不必恐慌，只要把一個草莓，在你的指甲上榨壓一下，使草莓汁乾在你的指甲上，然後輕輕地把指甲面在你的手掌中，前前後後的徐擦，便可生光，功效和美指液不差分毫。</p>

<h3 id="c257">「犧牲」 <a href="#c257" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e257" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">257</a></h3>
<p>— 陶斐</p>
<p>經商·據説是一種將本求利的事務：『千賣萬賣，折本不賣，』大槪也可以説是一句商塲中的格言。可是現在竟有經商而肯犧牲的，而且肯犧牲的又到處皆是，無論在那條街上，或者街的那一角，或者無論在那張新聞紙上，都可看到商店在那里『犧牲』。</p>
<p>在外國商店，減價大都用季候，佳節，或週年等名目。除此以外，要減價，即使要假借名義，總是偏向商店自己一方面説，如推銷存貨，吸收現金之類。他們從没有想到過用那『犧牲』的大題目，這也許是洋人的蠢。</p>
<p>看來中國人是一個肯犧牲的民族，而且，同時是一個肯接受人家的犧牲的民族，否則，肯『犧牲』的商店不會那麽多，而在『犧牲』的商店的生意也不會那麽盛。</p>
<p>要是你是一個例外，就是説要是你是一個不願或不忍接受人家的犧牲的人，你不用説不會走進那家門前標着『犧牲』的商店，就是看到了那兩個字心中也會引起一種説不出的感覺來。你的不相信宗敎，不就是因爲你不好意思以那敎祖所流的血來做你進天堂的入門證？那末，要是你走進一家賣犧牲菜的店舖的話，你一定會食不下喉的。因爲你怎麽忍心去吃那店主的壽險貯金的一部分，或者店主小姐妝奩準備的一角呢？</p>
<p>然而，你不去，没有關係，因爲你祗是一個例外，如我已説過的，中國是一個肯接受人家的犧牲的民族，在犧牲的商店不會只因你一個人不去就受到不能達到它的志願的影響的。你看肯犧牲的商店不是依舊在一家家多起來？</p>
<p>現在已有由『犧牲』擴展到『大犧牲』的，以後不知道要擴展到怎樣驚心蕩魄的一步。要是你有耐心的話，不妨等着瞧。</p>
<h3 id="c258">回憶 <a href="#c258" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e258" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">258</a></h3>
<p>— 唐弢</p>
<p>人們旣有往事，自然便有回憶。誰能忘記他的過去呢？我們都曾有過一個「年靑」。成功的人追懷着艱苦奮鬥的過程，失敗的更其不能恝然於已往的光榮。拖着現實的影子，每個人的腦海裏都潛藏着另一個世界，另一個人；這個人不像自己，然而却又分明不是别人。我們也曾爲「幸福」所羽翼，當還在母親懷抱的時候；無論處境是怎樣的困窮，但童年對於我們是絲毫没有惡意的，輕鬆，單純，眞率，美妙，這黃金的幸福的時代，也就夠我們回憶。</p>
<p>曾有人説過：「戀着過去的遺蜕是懦怯的事。」我認爲這不是一句健全的話，不過是某種情形下的一個慰解；過去非但不一定使人懦怯，有時還往往給人以刺激和鼓勵；那一個勇敢的人没有回憶呢？M　Stanley　Low説「Neither　allmens　efforts　can　efface　or　magnifythat　being　pasto」我們所回憶的只是那眞實的，不能毁滅或改造的過去。</p>
<p>回憶也是詩人的原素。Tennyson的in　Memorium；Lamartine的Le　Lec；Shakespeare的百幾十首Sonnets；以及許多短篇如Cowper的His　mothers　Portrait，Shelly的The　Past等。或者是對故舊的懷念，或者是對情人的眷戀，或者痛哭着亡親，縈迴着家庭的興替。他們愴懷於已往，高歌出内心的悒鬱。無論是悲歡得失，他們的想像是建築在回憶上，惟有回憶的土裏才能開出詩人血涙的花朶。</p>
<p>我們景仰詩人，更神往於詩人回憶裏使我們歌哭的情緒。</p>
<p>此外，歷史還給予我們以對世界的回憶。一代的興亡，一國的盛袞，CaosarAlexader，Napoleon　Bonaparte鐵木眞，忽必烈的雄圖；由和平到戰亂，又由戰亂到安定；歷史的回憶更足給予現實以一個足資借鏡的對照。</p>

<h3 id="c259">「目前主義」的異議 <a href="#c259" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e259" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">259</a></h3>
<p>— 狄岳</p>
<p>另境先生在六月十五日的自由談上，寫了一段「目前主義」。他以爲中國現在目前主義特别發達。對於他的意見，我覺得不能同意：根據他的話來看·他以爲「目前主義」是以眼前滿足或勝利爲目的的，並且分有消極與積極二種：消極的是「得過且過主義」，積極的是「唯利是趨主義」。</p>
<p>人類中除了極少數的天才和野心家而外，幾站很少有不是「得過且過主義」和「唯利是趨主義」。肚皮餓了要喫飯是一種本能，所以變革只是歷史上的一種必然和序。我看最値得我們注意的，還是中國目前究竟能有多少目前主義者。</p>
<p>不論豐收與荒歉的年頭，種一畝田總得丢幾隻洋的成本的農民，他們决不配做一個目前主義者。荷包裏没有飯票的靑年學生，他們也决不配做一個目前主義者。</p>
<p>没有工作的流浪漢，也决不配是一個目前主義者。没有找到主顧的智識份子自然也不能算目前主義者。爲什麽這些都不能算做目前主義者呢？因爲他們没有目前；他們的目前是不「得過」，要想趨利，亦無利不趨，而目前主義者大都是可以得過一下，和有利可趨的人類。在目前，到是「理想主義」與期待主義的全盛時代。</p>
<p>要葬送目前主義的人生觀並不困難，要葬送理想主義與期待主義的人生觀是比較費勁。</p>

<p>— 裘鵬</p>
<p>麗麗一撒手，撅起小嘴，把臉掉過去「不同你好。」</p>
<p>「爲什麽呢？」</p>
<p>麗麗不答，只回過臉來投給他鄙夷的一瞥，隨即拿起自己的書本離開了芉芉；從她的眼光裏，芊芊認出了那含有着一般同學所常常譏駡他的語句：「拖油瓶！木匠的兒子！」他像又給一個蜂針刺痛了似的，羞怯的低下頭去。</p>
<p>在那邊，却已起了大的喧笑聲：「一顆星，掛油瓶；油瓶溜，木匠修」芊芊抬起頭來，許多同學都把眼光集中在他身上，在齊聲唱着。最使他痛心的，是連那個平日跟他很好的麗麗，如今也叛離了他，加入他們一夥來欺侮他！在他那早已充滿了悲哀的小心裏，更滲入了一種失戀似的苦汁。他禁不住傷心的哭了。</p>
<p>他哭着，大夥的孩子們却圍住他拍手跳脚的笑。麗麗偎在另一個同學的身旁，故意把那同學給她的一塊餅兒誘着他。他感到這是一種異樣的恥辱，想馬上去告訴先生，可是經騐告訴他，這結果反是自己討一頓打。他又想自己忍住哭，舉起烏黑的小手背去揩拭眼涙，可是把兩個眼眶邊兒全塗得黑黑的，眼涙還是不住的流落下來。他受不住這羞辱，痛楚；終于哇的放聲哭着回去了。</p>
<p>哭着回去仍得遭媽打芊芊想着呆立在路上等眼涙乾。遠處麥田裏吹來陣陣的麥香，幾個把牛放在山麓吃草，祗顧自己取樂的牧童，有的三五個一起圍坐在樹蔭下擲石子玩，有的却像小魚似的在一條淸溪裏游泳着。道些孩子們雖然都跟芊芊一樣天生有一個悲苦的命運，可是他們在一起就過得那麽愉快舒適，比到自己，芊芊禁不住起了羨慕，他飛似的跑回家裏，憤憤的把書丢在地上：「媽媽，我不要讀書了，明兒還是看牛去。」</p>
<p>「怎麽，你不要讀書？」母親把正在搖着的紡車手突然丢了：「爲什麽呢？」</p>
<p>芊芊咬一咬嘴唇，不説緣由，只頑强的説：「不要讀就不讀了！」</p>
<p>「好！」母親重重的嘆口氣：「你這不學好的畜生啊：你老子原幾次三番要你跟他做徒弟，就因爲我瞧着他那行業没出息，這年頭兒養不活家，纔苦苦的自己日夜紡紗，掙幾個錢給你讀幾句書·將來望你有點好收成，誰知你却是這麽一株撩不起的瘟草呵！」</p>
<p>芊芊瞧着母親的眼涙直往下落，完全失了主意。</p>

<p>姐兒愛勒絲丁主張把他去在遠遠的地方，丢在花園盡頭，埋在一個洞裏，再用脚把掩上去的土踏緊。</p>
<p>「啊！我可不肯！」大哥菲利克斯説，「我要把它留着。我要用它去釣魚。啊，一隻染了媽媽的血的釣鈎，這才是一隻好釣鈎呢！我要用它去鈎許多魚出來，像大腿一般肥的魚呀！」於是他摇着紅蘿蔔鬚。紅蘿蔔鬚還因爲没有受到刑罰在發呆，他還在過分的悔恨着，喉嚨裏面還發出斯的歎聲，他在一大桶水裏面，洗着他那該打嘴巴的醜臉。</p>

<p>雷辟克家的你没有遺失什麽東西嗎，紅蘿蔔鬚？紅蘿蔔鬚没有，媽媽。</p>
<p>雷辟克家的你還不知道，爲什麽便馬上答應没有呢？先把你的衣袋翻翻再説罷。</p>
<p>紅蘿蔔鬚（他把衣袋的夾裏翻出來，他瞧着它們像驢耳一樣掛在外面。）啊是啦，媽媽請你把它還給我罷。</p>
<p>雷辟克家的還給我什麽呢？你難道遺失了什麽東西嗎？我是偶然問你的，不料我竟猜到了你遺失了什麽東西呢？</p>
<p>紅蘿蔔鬚我不知道。</p>
<p>雷辟克家的當心啦你會要扯謊的。你現在已經像一條粗心的銀白魚一樣亂竄着。慢慢地回答罷。你究竟遺失了什麽東西？是不是你的陀螺？</p>
<p>紅蘿蔔鬚正是啦。我竟想不起來了。我遺失了我的陀螺，是啦，媽媽。</p>
<p>雷辟克家的不是，媽媽。你没有遺失你的陀螺。你的陀螺已在上星期被我没收了。</p>
<p>紅蘿蔔鬚那麽，我遺失了我的刀子。</p>
<p>雷辟克家的什麽刀子？誰給了你一把刀子？</p>
<p>紅蘿蔔鬚没有什麽人給過我一把刀子。</p>
<p>雷辟克家的我可憐的孩子，同你一世都纏不淸的。看這樣子别人一定説我把你弄瘋了。可是我們現在祗有兩個人。我温和地問着你。一個愛他母親的孩子是應當把什麽話都告訴他母親的。我敢斷言你一定把你的銀幣遺失了。這事我本來毫不知道的，可是我相信我一定猜中了。你不要否認。你的鼻子在動着啦。</p>
<p>紅蘿蔔鬚媽媽，這個貨幣是我的。這是我的敎父星期日給我的。我把它遺失了；算我自己倒霉啦。這是一宗糟糕的事情，可是我可以自己慰解的。並且我對於這事也不很關切的。多了一個貨幣或是少了一個貨幣。</p>
<p>雷辟克家的看罷，你這嘮叨東西我倒老老實實地聽你説着呢。這樣，你竟把你敎父辛辛苦苦賺來的錢看得毫不在乎嗎？他是那樣痛你，如果他知道這事時，會要非常生氣的。紅蘿蔔鬚媽媽，　如我曾隨意用去了我的貨幣罷。難道我要把它保存一生嗎？</p>
<p>雷辟克家的給我住口！你是旣不應把它遺失，也不應當不得大人的許可便把它揮霍掉的。你現在没有了這個貨幣了；想法子把它補起罷，去尋出來，去製造一個，隨你的便。滾罷，不要再在這裏説空話了。（未完）</p>

<h3 id="c262">復興農村與棉麥大借欵和 <a href="#c262" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e262" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">262</a></h3>
<p>此次五千萬美金之棉麥借欵，明乎今日中國財政之實况者，亦知此係必有之事，無足異者。蓋自歷年内戰，重以災荒，政府收支已告拮据：益以世界經濟恐慌，餘波所及，百業凋零；更有外寇侵人，尙在抵抗；勦匪軍事，猶難結束；需欵孔亟，自所必然。而一顧國内公債，落至票面三四折，卽使續發，在一般經濟枯竭之中國，亦難得有人過問。同時黃金國家之美利堅，資金原料，兩告過卿，此固天作之合，棉麥借欵因以成功矣。</p>
<p>惟於此吾人有不能已於言者，即五千萬借欵，政府所得幾何？其於國民生計之影響，又復何如哉？如報章所言，在棉麥貨物出棧之初，卽須在借欵内償付貨價百分之十，九十日内，再付百分之十五，換言之，卽貨物尙未到華，五千萬借欵實得祗及百分之七十五，合三七，五○○，○○○美金。外加自美到華之運費及一切雜費，假定爲一成半，則尙餘百分之六十，卽僅三○，○○○，○○○美金矣。近　報載，上海各紗廠擬請以八折承買，則即以三七，五○○，○○○美金之棉麥，照價八折，尙餘三○，○○○，○○○美金，扣除運費七，五○○，○○○美金，尙餘二二，五○○，○○○美金，其中佣金固未計人，以及或不能免之其他耗費，亦不與焉。此種組舉大略之計算，容或不當。償還額固仍爲五千萬元，再就年利五厘，以三年計之，另加七十五萬。試與實得之數比較之，則此項借欵之利息固亦甚高也。但衡之往昔發行之公債，已優渥多多。惟吾人所不解者；復興農村委員會之餘音未已，而此借欵已告成立，其於中國農村之影響，究爲何如者耶？</p>
<p>此次借欵之理由，一則曰救濟棉紗原料之恐慌，再則曰，救濟農村糧食之缺乏，驟視之，一若此次借欵，有如某巨商所言，政府全基於體惜人民之至意，棉麥各得其用，非此不足以言善政者。然在棉麥借欵未宣佈之前，吾人雖健忘，當猶憶及紗廠减工問題，甚囂塵上，殊不下於今日借欵問題之　傳熱烈。各紗廠减工之理由，乃因外棉排擠，銷路淸淡，不得已而出之。今也不然，一變而言曰，紗廠原料缺乏，危機叢生，棉麥借欵成功，復興有望矣。前後如此，然乎否乎？豈亦「輿論指導」有方，此消息爲眞實爲可信乎？</p>
<p>此姑不論，且就借麥供民食一端言之。吾國農民窮乏甚矣，如華北各地小農，終年少有食白麫者，卽食高梁等劣物，亦量腹行之，務期節省，十室之中，未能温飽者，常佔七八。此實係中國目下之危機，一切罪惡所由生，農村復興委員會之召集，意亦在斯。是借麥以濟民食，因爲當務之急也。</p>
<p>然此實爲不知事理者之言，吾團農民食不得飽，非食糧生產之不足也。各地佃農，常須將全部收穫，一半以上，貢獻地主，自耕農雖無田租之負担，而賦税苛捐之剝削，亦不堪命。加以金融枯竭，高利貸之橫行，農產在未下種之前，多半已以「賣靑苗」「批續」等名羲，爲高利貸者所呑食，收穫以後，得稻累累，然生產者除納租繳捐還債之餘，自食無之，民食之不足，大半由此。是故吾敢信而言者，今日吾國糧食問題之　結，由於生產不足者少，由於分配不均者夥也。</p>
<p>美麥借貸，此係第二次，去年向美借麥債結果之慘痛，非吾人所能忘者。各地雖告　收，而麥債因有契約在先，進口如故，馴致糧價日落，農民收穫所得，初以爲未有之豐稔，或可獲一日之温飽，孰知反形不足，成本大告虧折，流亡者有之，餓斃者亦有之，禾稻朽於田中，搶米見於各地，誰實爲之，孰令致之，今日借債可裕民食，雖三尺孺子，未之敢信也。</p>
<p>棉麥爲吾國農產大宗，卽云供需尙有不足，此乃耕種未宜，地未盡利，社會制度之不良，有以致之，其中主要者，遭進。洋棉洋麥之排斥，實所使然。前財政部召集全國民食會議，曾有議案，以爲洋米傾銷，充斥於市，影響農村經濟，殊非淺鮮，爲正本淸源，挽救農業起見，惟有開徵洋米進口税，以示限制，一時洋米進口税開徵之説，隨又喧騰塵上。今據十三日報載，此税開徵，又將展緩。故無論其與棉麥借債之成立，有無關係，而言行如此，使人扼腕，豈不知去年美麥舊例，政府必將借得之棉麥，抑價售出，期得現金，此於實業部宣稱卽將施行之傾銷税，亦多矛盾，凡此種種，實爲吾人所萬惑不解者也。</p>
<p>另據中央社十四日南京電稱，汪院長向記者談話，謂此次棉麥借欵，以内容論，現在吾國棉麥兩項，每年均由外國　宗輪入，尤以美國爲多，據海關統計數目字，可以證明，故此次借欵，决不致發生使吾國農產物因而停滯之影響云云。此言信然。卽政府不向告貸，美國棉麥，亦必進口如故。不見澳洲小麥傾銷，論者以爲大患，而三數日前，南美阿根廷卽有三船二萬五千噸小麥，傾銷進口，今政府借欵之舉，不過使洋棉洋麥更有力，更有利，亦更迅速傾入吾國市塲而已。所謂不傷農產云者，前已傷之，今仍傷之，程度之差已也，不知中國農業之衰落，大半由於洋商之操縱與傾銷者乎，莠草不除，佳禾不生。進口農產傾銷，中國農業復興，兩者不共立。苟此次借欵而無傷農產，則中國農業卽不致衰落，農村卽可不予救濟，農村復興委員會之召集，無乃多此一舉也。</p>
<h3 id="c263">五千萬美債與中國棉紡織工業錢貫一 <a href="#c263" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e263" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">263</a></h3>
<p>近一二月間，華商紗廠因出品市價疲滯，營業虧損，不得已而出於減工停業之一途，請願救濟，成爲政府社會間之一嚴重問題。而最近又有五千萬美金大借欵之成功，專購美國棉麥，更爲一般人所震驚。然此兩萬萬元之數，倘用全部購買美棉，不過可得一百萬包耳！過去兩三年間，外國棉花之輸入中國者，在一百萬包以上，國家每年此項漏巵，連棉貨製品合計，視二萬萬元之數，實又倍蓰焉。是故若視此五千萬美金借欵爲重大問題，盍不對於中國棉紡織工業一切研究，當知問題有大於此者。蓋中國新式工業中，歷史之久，規模之大，用人之多，所係國計民生之區，莫紡織工業若。然其缺點之多，困難之甚，有如國家之不加維護，環境遭遇之不幸，本身競爭能力之薄弱，前途之欠光明，其足以影響國計民生者，亦無過於斯業。茲言其缺點與困難處。</p>
<p>（一）曷以云國家之不加維護國家保護實業，原爲歷來政府所宣示，但事實上不特無此事，或且反其道而行之。夫保護本國實業，必先徵收保護關税，但棉貨在不久前，尙有所謂「關税互惠協定，」予以最低税率，許日本棉貨輸入，同時各國亦援例得最優惠待遇，至最近始期滿終止。不特此也，根據不平等條約，中國境内乃有完全不受中國法律束縛之外商工廠，此種工廠勢力最偉大者，卽爲日人之在華紡織業，幾有喧賓奪主之勢。我國人紡織工廠在近十餘年中，經過奮鬥掙扎，非無相當之進步，然因國家政治之不上軌道，使工廠營業往往蒙受種種意外損失，而外商獨不受時局影響，此已優越於華商之處。乃政府對於中外紗廠，華廠不特未得優惠待遇，反遭壓迫；如加紗統税，細紗税輕而粗紗税重，事實上無異優待日廠，此其例也。他如華廠對政府有種種義務，而外廠恃有護符，絲毫不盡；華廠對社會上負各種責任，而外廠槪置不問，華廠對工人有某種制限，而外廠可行所無　。凡此不平之事，或爲他業所未有，故曰政府不加維護無遇於斯業　（二）曷以云環境遭遇之不幸抵制日貨，爲國人稍有智識者普遍同具之心理。從表面上言，謂抵制日貨毫無成效，似亦不然。從實際上言，確已抵制絕跡，則童騃有所不信。尤其棉貨一業，吾人試臨棉布疋頭之肆，檢閲各種布疋，除一部份爲道地西洋貨外，其餘卽屬完全國產。再細檢此國產布疋，前標識某地某廠織造。此某地某廠者，吾人固認爲國人資本國人經營者也。其公司名義商標，曾經政府註册執照，其出品亦且大書特書「奉財政部批准按照機製洋貨完税一道不再重征，」如此道地國產，自當得愛用國貨者之歡迎，若有人指此爲非國貨，當必有人唾其面而詆其誣，孰知此中仍多數爲日貨耶？蓋其他日貨，改冒國貨，尙可有識别之點，惟棉紗布疋，一經改換面目，或加染色整理工程，卽不易分辨。奸商利用此點，以售其奸而欺世牟利。社會且譽之曰，是能經營國貨者，如此國貨，吾無以名之，名之曰「假國貨。」有此「假國貨」爲國人所歡迎，故日廠所製棉紗布疋，雖在抵制期中，仍能銷行無阻。且因日廠出品比較眞國貨品質稍勝一籌，故「假國貨」比眞國貨爲易於推銷。又因日廠出品表面上爲國人所抵制，而售價較往時低廉，經營「假國貨」者，成本比眞國貨輕，獲利甚巨，趨之者多，而眞國貨更　人過問。在不抵制時，眞國貨售價較日貨爲廉，猶有一部份眞愛國者所歡迎，而得發展。自抵制後，不特華廠未收抵制之益，眞國貨且爲「假國貨」所打倒，而不能生存。此種不可恩議之事實，豈能爲社會所洞曉。故曰環境遭遇之不幸，無過於斯業。（三）曷以云本身競爭能力之薄弱現時中國紡織工業最大障碍，卽爲國内日商紗廠。彼日商多數爲日本國内有數之大公司所分設，或爲某種著名財團所設立，資本充厚，實力偉大，固萬非華廠所能及。而日廠上有政府保護，外有銀行後盾，内則技術工程優異，我則處處不如人。英人以棉紡業　國稱，世界市場猶爲日人所奪，而我則大盜在室，又如何能禦之。復次，彼日廠同業步趨　致，我則意見渙散，其他少工業尙可由一二堅貞之士，努力經營以底成功，　紡織工業　大規模　　不料，　國家社會環境人力整固改　不許。中外廠實力　劣之分益加此，　日本身　爭能力之薄弱，無過於斯業。</p>
<p>（四）曷以云　　之欠光明　近中日關税互惠協定雖經廠　　日人現時抗議卽使爲無效　則日人爲避免輸人我國關税增加之故，必更推設工廠於我國。上海靑島久經傳述日廠大規模之擴充，一二年優不難證諸事實，彼時華廠受日廠之壓迫必更加甚。我政府如此，人心如此，過去種種不如人者，在不遠將來，殆亦未必卽能改善。東北四省淪亡，則銷貨市塲爲之减　。國產原棉不特產額未增，且感品質退化，則天時地利亦不足恃。最近各廠减工請願救濟，而政府一無辦法，尤使人聞而扼腕。使紡織工業竟不能立足而日就寰微，則國家社會情勢眞有更　堪設想者。故曰未來前途之欠光明，與其足以影響國計民生者，亦無過於斯業。</p>
<p>然則中國紡織工業竟無出路乎，烏，是何言記者不敏，雅不願效時人所爲，侈陳大計，但請國人明白認識此種情勢，從此上下一致，爲自振拔，去其障碍，求其所以不如人者，所謂出路即在是已。</p>
<p>茲請進而一言五千萬美金之大借欵。此借欵爲一利害複雜之多方面問題，因其内容辦法未經公布，吾人此時亦僅能作抽象之討論。</p>
<p>㈠美國棉花已爲我紡廠所採用，且又甚多，目前國内原棉實感缺乏，能用低利借資輸人，當爲廠商所願望。</p>
<p>㈡政府以脷用巨資，在三年借欵期中，從事於有益建設生利事業，當然亦爲國人所屬望。</p>
<p>㈢使政府不善利用，而仍爲政治消耗，三年後歸還本利，便須現金流出國外。</p>
<p>㈣國内農產受此巨量棉麥壓迫，勢必値更低落，現時已見枯槁之農村經濟，必且愈感蕭索。</p>
<p>由一之説，廠商目前得蘇喘息，僅屬一時，非根本救濟辦法。由二之説，則爲毫無把握之希望，危險成份實占多數。由三之説，則爲政治家罪惡之假藉，爲國家巨大漏巵。由四之説，更爲國家社會莫大禍患。此項借欵利害成份，孰多孰寡，孰得孰失，吾人從此諸點可以估量得之矣。</p>
<h3 id="c264">從粉麥產銷論美麥借欵謝愕 <a href="#c264" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e264" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">264</a></h3>
<p>（一）二次美麥借欵之經過二次美麥借欵之動議，尙在一年以前，蓋自民國二十年江漢淮運成災，流離失所之災黎，多至數千萬人，乃有美麥借欵四十五萬噸之成議。此項美麥（其中附有麫粉百分之二十左右）運華後。除將一部份麥子與麫粉散佈於各省災區外。其餘均减價售與粉廠，換取現金。去年又盛傳仍由美顧問楊格氏之斡旋，有二次借美麥欵之説，數量與第一次同爲美噸四十五萬噸。自此説傳佈後，各方一致反對，因其時（民國二十一年秋）國内米穀豐登，糧價低落，湘省穀價慘跌至二元左右，其他產區之米穀與雜糧均在繼續狂落中，農村經濟，已達破產之程度，且第一次賑麥散佈於各冷僻地者尙有不少存留，復因賑麥分配與售現而發生之案件，報不絕書，此舉隨即無形停頓，然當局似未嘗忘懷也，在此番宋部長出國之前，市上曾一度傳説美麥借欵將舊事重提。並有成爲事實之可能，今果簽約於新麥上市之際矣。</p>
<p>（二）借欵購麥數量之傳説此次借欵，報載共美金五千萬元，合國幣二萬萬元。五分之四購棉，五分之一購麥，麥之總値爲國幣四千萬元。惟正式合同迄未公布，則價有大小，量有多寡，據廠商消息，麥一千二百萬斛，（三十六萬噸）麥價每擔作華幣五元二角半，再加麫粉四百萬包，凑成整數。糧商則謂麥四十八萬噸，價同，另加粉八十萬包。另一説仍與初次借欵之數相等。卽四十五萬噸。又傳並未購定，以後隨買隨銷照市作價。以上各説。均難證實。惟併凑麫粉。已無疑義。</p>
<p>（三）美麥借欵成後之市價本年國麥豐收，已成事實，各路新麥正在旺登，怱有此鉅量之洋麥成交，無異晴空霹靂，美國農民聞之欣喜，我國農民則呑聲飲泣，販商聞之生戒，不敢轉運；行廠存心觀望，中止出莊，投機商見有機可乘，大肆搗把，粉麥之價，乃如橫流直决一瀉而下，近聞浦東中關小麥，當地已跌價至每擔爲二元，卽出品高上之區。亦復逐跌不已，今年底碼已小。再加慘跌，農村狀况，不言可喩矣。茲將民國以來粉麥市價列後，可見此次借欵之影響。</p>

<p>其在淸光宣之交小麥出口解禁迄民國十一年以前，吾國雖有巨量粉麥輸出，麥常居於出超之地位，今年麥秋，比往年較好，據廠商約計，可敷各粉廠八月之需，但四個月之缺額，仍須仰給於洋麥也。</p>
<p>（五）廠商對於借麥之態度基上所述，即使美麥來華，亦無妨事。業中人曾云，三四十萬噸之美麥，僅數某某等廠半年之用，遑論其他。亦有謂本年美國若旱，麥收報歉，加以酒禁已開，需麥較巨，故預定美麥亦得其宜。但以此次借麥，適成立於本國新麥方登之時，商人聞訊，則趦趄不前，廠商則觀望不動，市　則突形鬆軟，於是麥價暴落，農民咨嗟，較之美農聞借欵成立，而色喜者適相反也。本市粉麥商人對於借麥，但要求遲六個月後裝船，俾本麥得有推銷之機會，不受擠軋。惟獨於麥之中間之以粉，則有切實之反對。以爲攘奪本粉銷路，結果或致波及工人生計，故有電請當局完全借麥不雜美粉云。</p>
<h3 id="c265">論美棉借欵時中 <a href="#c265" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e265" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">265</a></h3>
<p>自報載美國聯邦整理財政機關總理瓊斯氏宣稱：「業已允借美金五千萬元與中國政府，以作購買小麥，棉花，及麵粉之用。並預定五千萬美金借欵中，五分之四將作購棉花之用，餘者作購買粉麥之用，預計可得棉花九十萬袋，麥一千二百萬斛。」美國當局與我國朝野，莫不同聲相慶，以爲一方面美國存貨脱售，物價因之提高，他方面依我國今日之經濟情狀，對此大批棉麥，正感迫切需要，一舉而兩善備焉。惟據個人之觀察，此次美棉借欵，殊足損害我國之棉業而有餘，試申説如次：</p>
<p>（一）影響於棉農及棉商者外棉充斥市塲，華棉勢必跌價，花價跌落，棉農便無利可圖，致造成減種與失業之局面。而一般賴植棉以生之棉販，棉商，運棉商，堆棉商，以及軋花工人，彈花工人等，莫不間接受重大之影響矣。（二）影響於國内紗廠業者有以定購美棉，政府曾對華商紗廠八折出售者辯。竊謂大不然者：其一，我國每年仰給美棉，約計三百萬擔，通常足敷國内紗廠二年之消費。去年我國輸入數量，在三百萬擔以上，其中華商紗廠所消費者，僅及其半，餘則爲在華外廠所消納。今者一次訂買，供求上之週轉不靈，不免囤滯之虚耗；其二，我國内地紗廠，本不需用美棉，今者以爲美棉價廉，將被誘而競購之，致使本國棉花，造成滯銷囤積之局面；第三，姑如報載，定購美棉，每月以五萬包，分批裝運來華，仍不足供國内二年之需，事實上，更不能禁絕各國之訂購美棉，則國内市塲供求情勢不均，而市價之騰貴暴落亦在意料之中。</p>
<p>（三）影響於國内棉市者去年國内棉花市况，因本國棉產豐收，及美棉市價慘落之影響，衢之低落，幸國内紗廠需要甚殷，花價得常盤　　三十二三兩之間，本年國内紗廠，營業不振，一旦大批美棉輸入，易致需給不均·頗影響於花價之漲落也。</p>
<p>綜上所述，此次美棉借欵給予我國棉業　　多不良之影響，乃彰明　著者矣！與其耗此數千萬元之美棉借欵於無用之　，不若充作　棉基本，專爲發展與推廣吾國植棉　業之用，則產棉之區，藉以推廣，棉產可以增加，適供内國紗廠之需，而久困於農村經濟破產下之棉農與棉商，庶幾復蘇焉。</p>

<p>— 吾</p>
<p>吃飯難，並不是難於由手到口，而是難於到手，天災水旱草木皆兵的年頭固不必説，就是五谷豐登的太平盛世，也是如此，去年的豐收成災，據説是因爲美麥過剩的原故，然而此非出諸聖人之口，似乎不甚足信，何况當局諸公之所以要購買美麥，原是大發慈悲的救濟無飯可吃的災民，雖然長江流域的老百姓都吃慣了大白米飯，可是外國麥麵到底也可充饑；所以現在的好意反成惡意，豈不是寃煞？不過麥變成錢，錢又變成米糠，而嗷嗷待哺的災民終於不能到嘴却是眞的，</p>
<p>這樣説來，吃飯眞是不易，譬如有錢的人必須吃上白米飯·而且必須要有頂好的鷄肉魚之類的菜肴才能吃得下去，可是這樣吃久了未免過膩，於是改吃白色大菜，換換口味，而且據説上白米缺乏維他命，甚至會發脚氣病，所以醫生會勸他們吃些糙米，最好是吃些麥猌，這樣固然不大適他們的口味，可是爲了延年益壽却也没有辦法·還有許多紳士太太們，因爲吃得太好，大大的肥胖起來，在相士們的眼法中看來，自然是大有福氣，没有肉是不能載福的，可是對着鏡子仔細端詳一會，再拿着電影明星或是交際花的照片比較比較，却不免傷心，爲的是肥肥胖胖，上下一團，太没有了曲線美，難免不敎老爺們厭惡心生而打野食，於是除了請敎裁縫博士而在衣裳上打算之外還得實行减食，將一碗减成半碗，將魚肉換吃蔬菜。所謂「吃得苦中苦，方爲人上人，」紳士太太若想變爲委員夫人，也就不能不這樣苦練一番，到後來當然是　　身材，掌上可舞，穿起旗袍來，滿身曲線，那怕老爺們不心花怒放，就是美男子如寳玉者，也得對準她們的玉臂瓊腰多看上幾眼。</p>
<p>至於没有白米飯可吃，只好吃别人不吃的酸飯充飢的人們，當然不必相提並論，有許多大人君子説，他們是命該如此，大槪是前世的罪惡多端，然而他們没有飯吃總是眞的，他們可以恨誰呢，這只有他們自己才會知道，</p>
<h3 id="c275">罪惡 <a href="#c275" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e275" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">275</a></h3>
<p>— 毓</p>
<p>遠處的山迷蒙中被陽光照射着，趕鴨的招姐跳着，跑着，無憂無慮地唱着，「姐郎」之類山歌到小河邊去，阿順老爹含了旱烟袋，在門前的打麥塲上坐地，他在視着對面山上的陽光，脱口説出「又是一天」了他的多紋的額角上，被陽光曬成紫黑色，兩條粗大的手臂，他像不服老似的一使勁，靑的血管一條條蛇般地滿佈在黑臂上，他想笑，但是陽光已跑上天空，曬到背上微微感覺注意。旱烟袋没有離開他的嘴唇，他努力吸幾口，早已熄了。一陣「阿姐看鴨到河邊」的歌聲送來，阿順老爹搖着頭。他望着天空的四周，靑的天，一望無際　他失望了「又是一天！」</p>
<p>他皺了多紋的老臉，他想。陸田主家的三官昨天説，漢口又大水了，怎我們不見一點？兒子，媳婦，一請早去車水，那條小河恐怕也要乾，這裏幾百畝的田都靠着這條河。唔，總有乾的一天！他仰起頭來，太陽光像金星，樣剌着他的眼睛。他用粗布的袖衣，拭去額上的汗珠，想努力抽幾口烟，早已熄了。「唔！又是一天！」</p>
<p>晚上，煤油燈下，阿順老爹又説起去年欠的幾十塊錢，這是他每夜説起的，好像不落雨就是他家欠債的原因。阿順爺剛拍了阿順睡覺，賣了一天的勞力，今夜聽了爺的話分外刺耳，像老爹説他不努力工作。他提起兩條生毛的腿，脚底下的水泡映進老爹的恨簾，他想抽烟　但早已熄了。「阿順爺去睡吧，明天可以下雨了！」老爹含着早烟袋走到打麥塲上去，兒子阿順也偷偷地跟了出來，　　覺到爺的不自然底　勢，暗想自己是兒子，不應這樣使性，提起脚來幹甚？爺也希望今年收獲好，還淸欠的債。</p>
<p>老爹抬起頭來，滿大星斗，這是明天天晴的預兆，他嘆了口氣。</p>
<p>「爺！」阿順抱歉似的喊。</p>
<p>「怎不去睡？」老爺還想掩飾自己愁容。</p>
<p>「爺，去年這般好的收獲，還欠下了三十多塊錢的債；今年旱荒是一定的了。你看滿天星，還是十天半個月，小河裏也要没有水了」阿順爺望見爺的一點眼涙滾在眼角邊，他没有説出把田讓了，自己去做工的話，轉了話頭「再等一天吧，總有一天要下雨的！」</p>
<p>老爹在辨味兒子的話。「唔，去年好收獲，大熟年，反欠了三十多塊錢的債，今年没有下過雨，河水也要乾了。唔，唔，大槪鄉下人作了什麽藥，天老爺罰的，罪惡，罪惡！」他像滿意的有了答案，他想抽烟，但早已熄了。</p>
<p>滿天星星，閃耀着，像女人的眼睛。「唔，罪惡，等一天吧，總有一天要下雨的！」</p>

<p>— 小之</p>
<p>在上海，「揩油」，聽説是老板經理廠長以及大人先生之類的人們所最痛心疾首宵旰俱憂皇皇然必須謀對付及防止辦法的事；而另外一般人却的的確確視此爲唯一的生命線。譬如：公共汽車的老板，因爲賣票工人要措油，而這工人揩去的這一滴油，便是老板的養命之資源，老板豈不心痛？所以查票之外，三番五次的更改車價，又在車門處裝着一架勞什子的東西，據説，這些，就是老板防止揩油的有效辦法，又另據一個電車賣票説：「家裏有老娘和妻子，還有孩子要進學校，他媽的，工錢只二十隻洋，并且一個月裏總要因犯規便扣去幾成的工錢，若靠這個做生活費，一家人不要餓死嗎？」於是，他的唯一的生路，便是「揩油」。</p>
<p>自己是成天在馬路上混的一員勞働者，何以關於揩油的事也有兩椿比較有興趣的，今天談到「揩油」，就順便很零碎的把它寫在這裏：</p>
<p>（一）前幾天，滬西地方眞熱極了，像自己住的那樣一間斗大的鴿子籠，而又處在貧民窟裏，自然熱得坐不定，於是便加入坐在馬路沿乘凉的隊伍裏，偶然間一輛没有篷的汽車，滿載着紅紅綠綠的高歌着懲愛之曲的年靑的男女，在我們面前飛似的馳過，我們每個乘凉的人的面前立刻生出一陣香味的凉風，身上都感着分外的爽快。接着，一輛，又是一輛，於是我們不斷地享受着香味的凉風和淸脆的　唱，而極懇摰地感謝我們乘汽車兜風的哥兒姐兒們！</p>
<p>（二）電影院裏，跳舞場中，自然不是我們能夠到的地方，其實，它們本來就不是爲我們而有的啊！但當我獨自每次走過南京路的盡頭，西藏路口的時候，總會下意識地呆站住向排列着的五彩的電影廣告畫上死命地釘着揩油。在這裏，我得了好些知識：第一我就知道了電影院裏有肉感的擁抱，甜蜜的接吻，還有赤露的大腿，半裸的胸膛，此外，更有手槍，野人，木乃伊復活等等從來未見未聞的事。</p>
<p>其實，揩油的事，本來就不僅止於上海，到處都是一樣。一個人而生有眼睛，而肯把他所有的眼睛都大睜開來，便曉得生在現社會裏的人，没有一個不拚命地在揩油；便曉得現社會簡直是個揩油的社會，世界簡直是個揩油的世界！</p>
<h3 id="c278">戀愛問題 <a href="#c278" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e278" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">278</a></h3>
<p>— 愼敏</p>
<p>茫茫的塵世上，芸芸的衆生，爲了一個情字，不知犧牲了多少靑年男女，埋滅了幾許英雄豪傑，情海風波，無時或息。非但損失金錢，而且犧牲寳貴的精神，甚而至於身敗名裂，自尋短見，對簿公庭者有之，嫉好暗殺者有之，有一般大家閨秀，小家碧玉，或被金錢誘惑或被虚榮心籠罩，意志薄弱的女子，經不得這狂蜂浪蝶的引誘，那末她們就糊裏糊塗的作自由戀愛的工作了。但是開口自由，閉口自由的人們，大槪悞解了自由，以自由爲兒戲，對於自由戀愛的眞義，未必明瞭吧？因其朝秦暮楚，生張熟魏，一視同仁底趕那自由戀愛工作，那末有種種的下文來了，并有意想不到的事情發生了。</p>
<p>照這個「情」字的意義，用拆字法的眼光看來，就是靑年的心，所以富於情感的靑年，對於這個情字，是必由之路，大都在情海中游泳，在情網裏打筋斗</p>
<p>一個「戀」字，是變字的頭，所以變幻莫測，一忽兒戀愛，一忽兒變心，情戀，婚變，變化無窮，這是倉頡先生造字的辰光派定，不可更改的。</p>
<p>至於一個愛字，上半段是受字，下半段是憂字，所以憂情云者，必先飽受了一番痛苦，其結果終逃不了憂愁失意</p>
<p>人非太上，孰能無情，但用情貴於專一，不宜濫施，用的得當，是情，用得不當，是不情了，唉！情！鐵面無情！金錢萬能的情！勢利不過的情！除了金錢和勢利者，能享受情塲得意外，其餘的芸芸衆生，勤勤懇懇，急急忙忙，拚性拚命地，不遺餘力地，看中了前世無仇今世無寃的情，奮勇，努力，進攻，臨時完结，誘敵人深入，待敵來攻，退守最後防線，免戰牌掛起，説不定還要被對方强迫簽訂城下之盟哩，到那時，神經錯亂，意戀心灰，惟有自嘆命薄，情塲失意，回憶從前過那甜蜜的摟抱的跳舞生活，今日之下，一變而爲悽慘欲絕的跳黃浦時期了。唉！一失足成千古恨，轉回頭已百年身了。</p>

<p>店員通訊</p>
<h3 id="c279">没良心的哥哥 <a href="#c279" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e279" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">279</a></h3>
<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>我的確是一個喜歡拜讀店員通訊的同志，雖然我並不是某商店的職員。今天看到先生爲黃君解答的「可否去做贅婿」裏面這樣的幾句話：「現在有一班人，娶了妻子以後，每每會對於家庭中的各員，視爲陌路」突然似尖針般觸動了我久藴藏的苦悶；所以特地寫出來，請先生解答，先生該不致因我不是店員而拒絕的！</p>
<p>我有一個哥哥，正如先生所説的，娶了妻子以後，對於家庭中各員視爲陌路。」尤可惡的，斷絕了家庭的津貼了雖然以前並不要他津貼，但有時向他要錢，多少總有點拿出來。現在一家幾口，都是父親一個人擔負；父親每月收入有限，常有入不敷出之痛苦，所以曾説過呌哥哥多津貼一點，但他一口拒絕，説什麽自顧不暇，那有錢來津貼等話。甚致有時母親苦着臉，對他説暫借來用用，等父親領了薪水還，他也不肯，所以哥哥現在是一毛不拔的人了，唉！先生：我父親是一個忠厚的人，對於兒子的變態，從没説過一句，父親已是年過半百的人了，爲了經濟的困難，時常使他感到不安，而日漸消瘦了。母親呢，也時常怨聲嘆氣，説什麽「兒子不孝，還是没有的好。」</p>
<p>哥哥是否眞的没有錢，不絕對不是。嫂嫂但日常吃的補品，和作衣服等不要錢嗎？但可惡的嫂嫂，時常有意當着我們面説，這樣補品是她娘家人買給她吃的，某件衣料，又是誰送的，我打牌嬴的幾塊，給他（指我哥）用了等話。聽了眞氣死人！</p>
<p>先生你有什麽法子，可使我哥哥恢復以前狀態嗎？如蒙不棄，請給我一個答覆。敬祝</p>
<p>編安洪秀英謹上</p>
<p>編者按：法律對於人的行爲，分爲三大類：（一）命令行爲，（二）禁止行爲，（三）放任行爲。凡是一個人的法定義務，都是命令行爲；要是他「不行爲，」法律可以强制他行爲，或更處以相當懲處。凡是足以妨害他人法益的行爲，均爲禁止行爲；這樣行爲，法律加以禁止，犯者予以懲處。此外的就是放任行爲了：他做也好，不做也好，法律不加顧問，絕對放任。現在我國法律，規定一個人「對於無自助能力的父母，有扶養的義務。」這就是命令行爲；要是他不肯扶養，父母就可以「遺棄罪」控訴。照來信看來，尊大人雖年已五十以外，但尙能出外謀生；雖説入不敷出，究不能即認爲「無自助力」者；所以你的哥哥，實在並不一定有津貼的義務。何况在這種年頭，他是否是有餘力，也决不能憑着旁人的觀察來斷定。不過話又要説回來了：</p>
<p>一個人貴乎要有「人氣，」這「人氣」的組成，雖説很爲複雜，但對於他人的「同情心，」也是其中最重要的一個因子。我們不敢唱高調，希望人們個個做到「不獨親其親，」但至少限度，「親其親」是必不可少的。年逾半百的老父，還要他爲了生活而拼命，似乎極應該自告奮勇，去分分憂的。可惜這事情，法律上劃在放任行爲之内，使我們不得借重牠的權威，來積極的督促他去實行。在没有辦法之中，我們祇有消極的「呼喊」了，所以不知不覺，在答復黃君的信裏，就這樣的寫着；我們的苦心，洪君或許可以體諒了罷！所以你問「使你哥哥恢復以前狀態」的方法，我們除了説「用消極的感化」以外，實情没有辦法。這或許會使你失望的，因爲感化的效力，每每會敵不過蠱惑的魔力的呀！再天下事，求人不如求己，你的哥哥，旣已使父母失望，還是學你母親的口吻，説「還是没有的好」你現在應當反求諸已，求所以安慰兩老的辦法。你或者現在年紀尙小，學識經騐，當不能入世，那麽我想三年四年，總還可以好熬。現在你應當一方面鼓勵家中的各員，實行「勤儉」兩字，以減少令尊的負擔，並在精神方面，盡量的去安慰他老人家。一方面磨礪自己，使在最近的將來，能負析薪的重擔你當你没有哥哥罷了。最後我要問你的哥哥嫂嫂以及姪輩（倘有的話），現在是不是同住在一起？他們的日用，你哥哥是不是負擔？他旣經無情，我們就可以無義，呌他自立門户去的。</p>

<p>— 禧林</p>
<p>「丹麗，好了，現在好了，佐川這矮鬼眞不錯，我要他向他們軍隊去運動，果然都辦到了凡是我的那廠，市房等都不損壞絲毫的，儘管由閘北轟炸到江灣都不要緊，你看，好不好，只是幾萬塊錢運動費算什麽？還有」他説到這裏停了一下，有不便出口的地方，便「這也好，橫直與我們自己也有好處」的結了尾。</p>
<p>三姨太拉信他的手，很温柔地撫摸着，他在這些地方無論如何是使得三姨太佩服的。事無論大小，他總會有好方法來處置的。記得有一次廠裏罷工，工人把他包圍了起來，他圓滑的先挑選那些老的工人談起家常，詳析利害，説服了老年人，便分散了工人的戰線，事情便平安地過去了。有一次被檢查出廠裏存有大批日貨，起初大家喊着要拿來充公或燒潔，但他只買通了幾個首腦，於是報上登着是誤會了事。至於他的交際手腕更是圓轉轉滑溜溜的，上海人誰都肯説他一個「好」字。</p>
<p>他説「與我們自己也有好處」是什麽好處，三姨太也來不及追問他，因爲他流水似的接着説下許多話：</p>
<p>「昨夜就開始打了你曉得嗎？當然我也希望趕快打完，不然究竟也難免一些損失了市面是要設法維持的，金融總要能流通些，還怕亂黨乘機搗亂呢！好，不要和你説這些了，今晚在趙一山家裏開茶舞會，大家借這個機會商量維持市面的方法，今晚我來帶你去好了！現在，現在還早，你再睡一下子人要緊，我又要到行裏去了，佐川在等我，他介紹我一筆煤生意，改一下牌子一定可以大傾銷，今早的煤便大漲價了，一定還有漲。」他説完就出去了。</p>
<p>三姨太覺得介夫不願愛她了，昨夜通晚没有回來，今早坐一下又走了。但是聽了介夫這一番談後，她對戰爭却放下了心，恐怖是庸人自擾的。她起身到浴間盥洗着的時候，她想到今天這一天怎樣消遣呢，尤其現在還不過上午九點鐘時候，她的朋友們大槪誰都還在睡夢中。她踏着一雙繡花拖鞋走回房裏，先讓自己的身體很舒適的　在軟沙發裏，腿架起來像男子一樣搖　着，裸露的脚脛顯示着她全身都是可愛的白肉。於是拿一枝烟抽吸着，然後再想拿一本什麽愛情小説來看看。</p>

<p>— 興之</p>
<p>賈克歐凱與潘琪的訂婚好萊塢最近傳説着的一件怪事，就是派拉蒙公司的賈克歐凱忽然同好萊塢著名多婚的狂放明星潘琪霍金絲喬賽發生了熱戀。這件事的内幕非常有趣，現在好萊塢的人互相談着這件事。</p>
<p>賈克歐凱在派拉蒙公司裏，比較起來，年紀最輕。他在影界之中，從來没有同任何女子發生過愛情，這也是好萊塢的人個個知道的。至於他爲什麽不同任何女子發生愛情呢？這個問題，亦曾經有人提出過。據賈克歐凱自己説，好萊塢的女子没有一個中他的意。這個口氣是十分的大，好萊塢的女子們亦曾有幾個公然在雜誌及報章上質問過他。當然這侮辱式的話要使好萊塢的女子們大下臉子的。</p>
<p>賈克歐凱當時看了這班好萊塢的英雌這樣聲勢洶洶，他就立刻改變了論調，但是有一部分的人已經很明白了他的意思。據説賈克歐凱生平最厭惡的就是離婚。他所以説好萊塢的女子没有一個中他意的，就是説好萊塢的女子對於婚姻太隨便了。太容易離婚了。</p>
<p>賈克歐凱在好萊塢數載，從來没有一次同女子發生過戀愛。但是最近居然發生了這件咄咄怪事，也會和一位以多婚著聞的女子提到婚姻的問題了。</p>
<p>潘琪霍金絲喬賽，這是誰都知道的一個怪物。他的結婚的次數，有的説，已經十幾次，有的説還不止。就是她自己亦不知結過了幾次婚。有人問她時，她説「没有統計過。」</p>
<p>好萊塢的人，都談論着潘琪的衆位丈夫中，不知究竟誰能勝任。而現在這位厭惡離婚的賈克歐凱竟鍾情了這位不知離了幾次婚的潘琪。誰能夠説這件事情不是荒乎其唐的怪事呢？</p>
<p>還有可怪的是賈克歐凱的母親聽説她的兒子賈克同多婚的潘琪發生了愛情之後，她快樂得眼涙都笑了出來。她説，「潘琪在好萊塢受許多人的非笑，她是個可憐的女孩。我很愛她。她很可憐。」</p>

<h3 id="c282">評「大富豪」The　Millionaire <a href="#c282" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e282" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">282</a></h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>看過「博愛」之後，喬其亞立斯的表演技巧在我的記憶中留下深刻的印象。雖然這「大富豪」的表演成績，因着劇的内容的不同於「博愛」，以致不像「博愛」中的表演那般深刻，可是這另一作風的表演，却仍有着他的成績。看罷，當他以前在害病的時候，他憂鬱，他煩悶，雖然他擁有極大的鉅資，可是疾病纒着他，使他不能不暫時放棄他的事業。關於這些，他的表演和「博愛」的後段有着相同的情調。其後，他在修養期中，却又受妻僕的拘束，以致心緒麻亂，但是在極不高興的時候，也仍得平心靜氣。就在這裏爲止，他開始和一少年經營加油站事業。於是他有着勞働的機會，雖然這是背着家人私幹的勾當，可是這對於他的健康却有着極大的帮助。因爲健康的復原，於是他的性情也就改變過來。他活潑，他有生氣，完全顯出另一種歡樂的精神。如上所述，他對於劇情的轉變，完全把握信了。所有他的一舉一動，甚至於在聲調上都顯出他表演的聰明。</p>
<p>然而我們是否祗看到表演的優點而漠視這内容的批判呢？</p>
<p>無疑義的，這是爲富豪　　頌德的作品。工廠主能夠如此　工人們所擁戴，以及他用盡方法促成靑年人走上「成功之路」，都是本片的重要主題。同時，一個大富豪對於辦事業的經營，不過　在無事的時候，一種平凡　　　而已，這一點，倒使我們得着一種新的啓示至於本片的導演的手法，雖然是全用着舊的方法，不見特色，可是對於演出的仔細，却很値得注意。當然，這部影片的構成，完全着重在主角的表演，所以導演常使着長度的「跟鏡頭」，使得喬其亞立斯能夠充分表演。其他如對白的幽默，而動作上反而没有喜劇的成份，也可以説是導演的特殊之處。我們知道，導演是全劇唯一的總負責者，所以在這裏可看出他並没有放棄他自身的責任。</p>
<p>其他各點，没有詳細説明的必要，總之，我們在這部影片中總可看出美國少數作品的成績了。</p>
<h3 id="c283">評「紅杏出牆」 <a href="#c283" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e283" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">283</a></h3>
<p>— 燕南</p>
<p>我記得不久以前，有一張「滿園春色」的片子，現在又來一張「紅杏出牆」（Pleasure　Cruise），如果説這兩個名稱是一個譯的話，他肚皮裏的詩料，大槪是不少吧。影片内容，也相差無幾，我先介紹一些本事。</p>
<p>妻子是不安份的，丈夫是懦弱的，於是妻子獨自出去旅行了，丈夫也跟踪而去，在船上，妻子約了一個靑年幽會，却被丈夫設法把靑年鎖了起來，他自己去赴約了。下了船，又騙那靑年到他們家裏，用一個妻子的烟盒，把靑年嚇走了，夫妻倆也就愛好好如常。</p>
<p>劇旨有些什麽呢？只有敎導作丈夫的，怎樣用冷雋幽默的方法，去約束妻子，維持愛情。不過，有不少小關節却是非常可愛的，形容一個良心未泯的女女，一個不堪　　獨守的寡婦，都能淋漓盡致，刻劇入微。當然，　完全是算一張滑稽　，所以多少地方　都是　似兒戲，但也不是胡　，僅是很輕妙的呌人發笑。</p>
<p>導演對於這種滑稽性的影片，的確是很成功的，一起首由一幅裸體畫，引入正文，其微妙處，不可思議。全片是有很複雜的寫作，但是只用大寫的幻入幻出，來表示時間空間的轉移，有時連演員面目，都不攝入鏡頭，巧妙的簡略，愈見故事的緊凑。寫幽會一幕，雖用簡筆，而赴約以前，那三個主角的思想行動，絲絲入扣，眞是導演獨到之處。不過中間有不少地方却形容過份一些，一個浪漫女子，而到後來能安於家室，懦夫而能想出巧妙的欺騙方法，都不是觀衆所能意想得到的事實。而且這個丈夫雖然聰明，但是究竟没有什麽摰愛的表現，怎麽能感動妻子回心呢？影片却就這樣的結束了。中間寫夫婦兩人的個性和感情破裂一幕，却又是很好的。總之。導演局部方面，是很超越的，但大體上就似乎無力顧及了，當然一半也爲劇本本身和附合幽默滑稽所累。攝影雖然不少是極美的畫面，然而精彩却完全成全了分幕，光線全片是多麽平常阿！佈景道具，根本就是簡單的，而且船上不少，也似乎是實地攝影，所以一切都很能像眞。對白妙極了，這片所引人發笑，使人暢快的十分之八是由對白所造成的。穿插很重要的，有地方竟喧賓奪主，但絕對不是什麽劣點，因爲那樣的穿插都是非常呌人興奮的，而且也並不破壞劇情。</p>
<p>羅蘭特楊Roland　Ycung在這片子裏是最出色的，他扮那丈夫，前半部動作，形容一個「縮頭男子」，恰到好處，而後半部的活潑，更是有趣，一切都是很自然的。而且一言一動，輒使人發笑，沉着裏包含了幽默。飾妻子的是Geneyieve　Tohin美得很，她驚措而强自鎭定，表情很好，不過對於浪漫表演，却差了一些。寡婦和剃頭的兩人，詼諧可喜，餘外更只是片段的出現，作作活背影而已。</p>
<p>這片子技巧和表演是最好，故事不甚完整。</p>
<p>副片印度風土，太宗敎化了。新聞片很好，内中蕭伯納游泳，被記者包圍等，却極有趣味。</p>
<p>總之，這一次的節目是福克司公司很上乘的出品。</p>
<p>觀衆意見</p>
<h3 id="c284">從大光明歸來 <a href="#c284" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e284" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">284</a></h3>
<p>— 嘉南</p>
<p>喧傳已久的電影之宫重改組的大光明在今天開幕了，當我六點多鐘經過那裏時，已看見乳色的燈光廟映着無數的羣衆，包圍着客滿的牌子。九點鐘踏進那個宫門時，還有許多影迷，一列列的圍着票窗，像東洋兵在華北一樣老是不肯退去，預備等待着意外的機會。</p>
<p>在五色的噴水池傍的一個門裏進去，踏着綠色的長地毯忙亂中對好座位挨下了。時間已過了規定時刻，可是一張張唱片還是來個不停，直待九點半多，燈光漸漸黑暗下去而照例的新聞片，滑稽片，歌舞片，一幕幕過去，最後正片「熱血雄心」開始了。</p>
<p>這個故事，是根據海軍少將愛德華愛爾斯勃所描寫大戰中一段故事。所述少年軍官捐棄了愛人，榮譽，性命，爲民族，國家爭光，的確値得做現代軍人模範的。尤其是他不等待着命令，施放魚雷，轟炸敵艦，租最後讓同伴逃生，自己犧牲着去成功偉大有使命。這種精神，眞呌只知保持實力，實行不抵抗和假名抗日，攫奪地盤的軍人，活活羞死</p>
<p>演出方面當然推蒙高茂萊的潇洒，自然，沉毅的態度爲最佳，許斯頓的軍官，臨陣施令一種從容不迫的姿態，確合劇中人的身份，伊文絲在這片裏並没有很精彩的表演，她全劇的前半部，穿揷太多，尤其是跳舞的幾幕，佔據了很久的時間，幾乎使觀衆找不着全劇的中心。攝影除掉幾個游藝塲和跳舞的鏡頭，覺得太呆板外，其餘都還可以。</p>

<p>魯道爾夫説：「我到不是什麽色鬼，我不過是永遠沉醉在我自己的魔力之中的一個人罷了。你呌愛倫娜儘管慢些。要來見我的，總須打扮得好看些。他説着就進臥房去換衣服去了。露却立刻忙了起來。她一　替魯道爾夫布置座位，又行了賄賂打發走了那在塲監視的警察；一方面呌人打電話給愛倫娜，讓她趕快離開維也納，因爲他來了，倘是見不到她，他一定要奔到她家裏，或者要和她的丈夫打起來。露却剛吩咐完，客廳　忽然起了一陣喧嘩之聲。她側耳一聽，將肩胛一　，原來愛倫娜已經來了。這時晚餐已備齊，大家一齊往大飯廳裏去，愛倫娜亦跟著進了大飯廳。露却連忙將飯廳門關了，跑去看魯道爾夫。魯道爾夫已經換了一副簇新的軍服，很有些舊日的威儀。他從臥房裏跑了出來。露却攔阻着他，但他一推把她推開了。他命令將愛倫娜帶進來。露却告訴他，諸位賓客剛才人席，最好請他到大飯廳裏去罷。</p>
<p>魯道爾夫一定要人將愛倫娜帶來見他，并且還要香檳酒。露却没有法子，祇好打發人去喚愛倫娜去。一回愛倫娜來了。她看見了魯道爾夫，一時説不出話來，祗是婷婷地站在他面前。魯道爾夫仔細對她看着，從頭到脚，她站着如同一尊大理石像。魯道爾夫忽然地將她抽了一　嘴巴。她還是默沉無語。他忽然又抱住　她，很命地吻着她。「你多少時候没有給人　這樣吻過了？十年？十年以上了！你想想！」</p>
<p>倫娜還是站着不動。魯道爾夫還是吻着她，不過較以前稍爲温存些。他説「來，我們一起喝些香檳。」愛倫娜慢慢地跟着他，好像受　他的催眠似的。一回兒她開口了，她説她已完全忘記了他了。魯道爾夫説那是很可惜的，不過今天晚上，大家　　温温舊　，他喝着香檳酒，而她祗將酒杯舉了一舉，又將牠放下了。</p>
<p>魯道爾夫忽然看見了愛倫娜手上的結婚，戒指，他喊道：「喉，這種中等階級　妝飾　　在你的　上　實在太不　樣了。我不喜歡看，我們一定要去掉牠。一他説完了　就從愛倫娜手指上將戒指搶了下來。</p>
<p>「還給我　　戒指還給我！」愛倫娜着急地喊首。</p>
<p>「是的，寳貝，我明天早晨一定還你。」</p>
<p>「我明天早晨不和你見面，你現在就還我，」愛倫娜懇求着。但是魯道爾夫已將戒指藏在衣袋裏了。（未完）</p>

He will leave Beiping for Zhangjiakou within days. The original order for Song's return states: "Chairman of Chahar Province, Song Zheyuan, was previously ordered to have Civil Affairs Director Wu Yong act as his proxy due to his command of military affairs.

<p>(Nanjing) Sheng Shicai, Acting Governor of Xinjiang, telegraphed Chairman Jiang on the 15th to report on the situation in Xinjiang Province. The original telegram stated: "Chairman Jiang Jieshi, Your Excellency, I, Shicai, am honored to have entered your service and am deeply grateful for your unmerited affection. I am constantly mindful of repaying the country. Previously, with a keen desire to serve the nation, I joined the army in the western frontier. Now, having been publicly recommended by all sectors, I am temporarily serving as the Governor. I am inadequate for this heavy responsibility, which is truly beyond my capabilities. Fortunately, former Chairman Jin has resigned, and the various ethnic groups who opposed Jin have gradually been pacified. From now on, the people of Xinjiang Province can rest and recuperate, and peace is in sight. Unexpectedly, Ma Zhongying, a bandit by nature, has become a source of chaos. He has violated the Central Government's explicit orders and personally led his troops to exacerbate the unrest in Xinjiang, occupying Zhenxi and Hami and capturing the ancient city of Fuyuan, where he has engaged in massacre, looting, and unspeakable atrocities. I, Shicai, have mobilized troops and advanced to intercept them, relying on the prestige and virtue of our troops to completely defeat the bandits. We are currently in pursuit. I am sending this telegram in advance, earnestly requesting your review and instructions so that I may follow them. This is my fervent hope. Sheng Shicai, Acting Border Defense Governor of Xinjiang, respectfully." (18th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>Stalemate at the World Economic Conference</p>
<h3 id="e14">Stabilizing Exchange Rates, Universally Reducing Tariffs, Clashes in European and American Opinions <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>Although the US Warned, France Still Insisted; No One Paid Attention to the Silver Issue (London) The situation at the World Economic Conference has not improved due to President Roosevelt's warning about handling the issue of dollar stabilization with caution. The French representatives still insist that discussion is useless until currency is stabilized and that in the current environment, even concrete proposals to reduce tariffs by one-tenth are meaningless. However, the delegations from the most concerned countries, including France, are unwilling to criticize this matter before the situation becomes clear. It is generally expected that President Roosevelt's warning is only related to figures and stabilization methods. It is heard that the US delegation has accepted the principle of stabilizing the dollar. The figures mentioned previously (approximately four US dollars to one British pound at the current rate) are seen in the US market as sufficient to deter the US policy of currency inflation. President Roosevelt's message will certainly cause the US, Britain, and France to restart negotiations with bankers on a new basis. The Chinese representatives Song Ziwen, Yan Huiqing, and Guo Taiqi went to the outskirts of London today for a rest. The Japanese delegation discussed the US proposal this morning and said that it would take longer to study the US proposal, so they could not express any opinions at this time. Mr. Sprague, who served as an advisor to the Bank of England in 1913 and has recently been appointed as an advisor to the US Treasury Department, told a Reuters reporter today that negotiations to stabilize the dollar are currently in a fluid state. He hopes that an agreement will be reached soon. It is heard that the progress of this negotiation has temporarily stalled because President Roosevelt is not prepared to agree to suspend his authority to inflate the currency during the currency truce. (18th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Washington) The US President believes that the European proposal to stabilize exchange rates is too strict, while London sources say that representatives from other countries feel that the US President's plan to reduce tariffs is also too strict. However, observers here generally believe that the two different opinions should not be difficult to reconcile.</p>
<p>The plan to stabilize exchange rates was telegraphed to the President by the US representatives and is generally similar to that announced by French Finance Minister Bonnet. The US President did not reject it but said that it was too crystallized to use it as a temporary stabilization basis. This was before the President took a train out of Beijing for a summer vacation and handed it over to the Treasury Department and currency advisors for joint research. It is heard that the content is that the major financial countries should jointly establish a Stabilization Fund Committee, and the stable prices of the US dollar and the British pound should be comparable to the current levels.</p>
<p>As for the US President's tariff proposal, it was sent to the Economic Committee by the US representatives and has been published by the Secretariat. It advocates extending the tariff truce, universally reducing tariffs by 10% based on the current rates on June 12, and making efforts to eliminate tariff barriers, concluding multilateral agreements, and further reducing tax rates. According to the US representatives' report to the government, most European countries believe that immediately and universally reducing tariffs would cause difficulties for many countries, resulting in disruptions to their financial plans. However, some countries advocate negotiating mutual methods to achieve the same goal.</p>
<p>As for the US government's opinion on stabilizing exchange rates, it wants a reasonably temporary stabilization method but is quite worried that once temporary stabilization is agreed upon, it will seek permanent validity. The US government believes that no plan can be adopted as a permanent basis until all possibilities have been fully studied.</p>
<p>As for the silver issue, neither here nor in London is it given much importance. US silver producers are quite disappointed that the Economic Conference does not intend to consider platinum and gold together in the stabilization exchange rate plan. However, according to London sources, a small committee can be set up separately to consider the silver issue. (17th National Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Washington) According to reliable sources, the US government is not very satisfied with the currency stabilization proposals put forward by Europe. Treasury Department experts conducted a rigorous discussion of the proposal today but announced in the evening that they did not consider the proposal to be satisfactory. (17th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) The Acting Secretary of the US Treasury Department declared in Washington yesterday that President Roosevelt had received a detailed report from the US delegation to the Economic Conference on the plan for European countries to temporarily stabilize exchange rates before leaving Washington for vacation. Roosevelt replied that the US was prepared to listen to all proposals, but the aforementioned plan to stabilize exchange rates could not be accepted, and limits were placed on the powers that the US delegation could exercise. In other words, the US could not give sympathetic consideration to all plans to stabilize the currency. It was also said that Federal Reserve Bank President Harrison did not go to London as a representative of the US government, but only to confer with the presidents of other central banks. Opinions at the Economic Conference regarding the US acceptance of the currency truce proposal were quite divided, so there was not much surprise about the above declaration. However, some people in London were quite surprised, because the US delegation had unanimously approved the currency truce plan submitted to Roosevelt, but the President had rejected it. The French delegation adopted a reserved attitude and would express its opinion after fully understanding the official text of Roosevelt's proposal. This morning, French Finance Minister Bonnet began to contact the US delegation, at which time the US delegation had just received a Washington telegram regarding Roosevelt's decision but had not yet translated the code, so it only had a vague idea. Roughly speaking, although President Roosevelt rejected the currency truce, his wording was not as firm as reported by the Washington telegram yesterday. The US reply, rather than directly rejecting the proposed measures, advocated amending them. The US delegation declared that it could present accurate information to Bonnet at 6:00 PM. (18th Havas Dispatch)</p>

<p>Should Be Handled in Washington, Not by Those in Europe (Washington) Although there are various rumors in London, the US government still believes that there is no possibility of realizing the plan to stabilize the dollar at this time. Senior officials here also stated that if the dollar is to be stabilized, it should be handled in Washington, not by those in Europe. (17th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) The release of news from the US regarding the proposed 10% tax reduction has embarrassed the US delegation. A US representative told reporters today that this is only a suggestion from one of the US tax experts and may not be included in the official proposals that the US will submit to the World Economic Conference.</p>
<h3 id="e16">Contents of US Proposal <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>Reduce Taxes by One-Tenth, Extend Tariff Truce, Conclude Agreements, Stabilize International Trade (London) The most important event at the World Economic Conference today was the US delegation's submission of proposals to the Economic Committee. The main points are to reduce import taxes by one-tenth, revise import restrictions, and extend the tariff truce period. The details are as follows: (1) From June 12, 1933, the existing import taxes of each country should be universally reduced by 10%, and surcharges and other special levies on imported goods should be reduced in the same way.</p>
<p>(2) The difference between the current preferential tax rates given to products from any source outside the importing country should be appropriately reduced.</p>
<p>(3) Import restrictions other than tariffs should be given equal liberalization. Import restrictions include various plans of an economic nature that reduce imports in addition to import taxes and necessary customs procedures. The US delegation also intends to submit a document on import restrictions, containing some specific suggestions for procedures.</p>
<p>(4) An agreement should be sought based on principles and applications to manage the use of import quotas and similar systems. The purpose of this agreement is to reduce unnecessary instability and obstruction in international trade and to avoid discriminatory treatment of the same goods from different sources. The US delegation also intends to submit concrete proposals.</p>
<p>(5) This multilateral agreement to reduce or mitigate import taxes and other trade barriers should be implemented and become binding after being ratified by a sufficient number of countries. The term "sufficient number of countries" refers to countries that account for at least 50% of world trade in 1933, according to the League of Nations' 1933 Yearbook of World Commerce.</p>
<p>(6) The current tariff truce should be extended for a sufficient period after the close of the World Economic Conference to form a solid foundation for preparing bilateral or other methods of negotiating a constructive plan to organize international trade. The US delegation will submit more detailed proposals on this point, including permissible exceptions or reservations.</p>
<p>(7) In addition to drafting an agreement on the above issues, the Conference should also promote further reductions in trade barriers through resolutions, such as using reciprocal agreements based on most-favored-nation treatment. This type of reduction should apply to various forms and methods of managing imports, not just import tax rates, but limited or temporary exceptions may be adopted with the approval of the World Economic Conference to accommodate special circumstances.

<h3 id="e17">War Debt Problem: US Sends Note to Debtor Nations <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>War Debt Negotiations to Begin Next Month; The Note to France is Strongly Worded (Washington) Today, the US government stated to the debtor nations that if the US Congress agrees to amend the war debt, the debts of Britain, Finland, and other non-defaulting nations will be considered first. It is heard that the note sent to France by the State Department is quite straightforward in content, only asking the French government to pay attention to the fact that two installments have already been defaulted on, without mentioning the negotiation of the war debt problem. Although Italy paid one million yuan, because it is believed that the amount paid is too small, the tone of the note is similar. The same is true for Belgium and Poland. However, the note to Finland praises it for paying the full amount as required. The notes to Britain and other countries that have paid part of the debt state that the US will be happy to consult, hoping to be able to readjust. It is now heard that several congressional leaders will remain in Washington during the summer because it is expected that negotiations on the war debt can begin next month, and the President will consult with them at any time. (17th National Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Washington) The US government has sent a note to France with quite harsh wording, ignoring France's request to consider the war debt and urging it to pay attention to the fact that the last two installments are currently unpaid. At the same time, the US made an informal statement to France that while the US can pay attention to France's statement on the war debt issue, other countries have at least repaid part of it, and France must place itself in the same position as other countries before the war debt can be considered. The US also sent the same note to other countries that have not fulfilled their debts, such as Belgium and Poland. (17th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e18">Thoughts on Revitalizing Shanghai and Revitalizing the Countryside <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>Zhabei, located in Shanghai, used to be a prosperous area. Along the Shanghai-Wusong Road to the Wusong area, the scenery was not only beautiful, but factories were also lined up. Near Jiangwan, there was even hope of becoming a cultural district. Although Wusong was not a key area for industry and commerce, its upward trend was also very obvious. In a few decades, it would undoubtedly be able to extend the prosperity of Shanghai. Unfortunately, after the January 28th Incident in 1932, Zhabei was reduced to rubble.</p>
<p>Wusong was also reduced to ashes. Looking back on the past, one cannot help but feel sorrow. All Chinese people who are determined to revitalize the Chinese nation hope that Shanghai can first recover its prosperity. On the one hand, this is to promote the development of our industry and commerce and establish a foundation for construction. On the other hand, it is also to show that our nation will ultimately use its own strength to open up a new path for its future.</p>
<p>There are two ways to revitalize Shanghai. On the negative side, although Shanghai is richer than other cities and is the main export port for goods produced along the Yangtze River, its overall politics are naturally more advanced and organized than those of the interior. However, having just experienced a major disaster, the scars have not yet healed. Not only has the economic power of the hardworking masses been severely hit by the military, but also the asset holders above the middle class have suffered huge losses. It is really difficult to restore the original state in a short period of time. Therefore, the initial work of restoring Shanghai's prosperity, such as how to maintain social order, how to provide convenience for industry and commerce, and how to gradually organize transportation, although the authorities have tried their best to enable the people to live in peace, have not yet achieved a state of happy employment due to the decline in economic power. The general customs on the sea tend to be opportunistic and speculative in order to seek personal comfort in life, and there is a lack of effort in long-term public plans. After a major disaster, they naturally become more dispersed, and their abilities become weaker. This is one of the reasons why it is not easy to restore prosperity.</p>
<p>In the future, the way to revitalize Shanghai should not only focus on negative work and temporarily maintain the status quo, but also actively develop it. The current urgent task is first to seek progress in industry and second to restore commerce. Who cannot know these two things? Who cannot say them? However, due to internal reasons such as the rampant activities of bandits, there is no place to sell even excellent manufactured goods. Due to external reasons such as the fierce international competition in industry and commerce, the manufactured goods of backward countries, although labor is extremely cheap and raw materials are very cheap, are difficult to compete with foreign merchants due to the lack of careful management and precise equipment. Moreover, there is no market to be developed overseas, and the interior lacks the ability to purchase. The existing industries are also threatened by various threats and feel that survival is not easy, so they have no time to think about ambitious plans. However, China is ultimately different from Europe and the United States. Up to now, the whole of China still has many places that can be developed, and opportunities can be found everywhere. If you want to work hard earnestly, in addition to restoring urban prosperity, you should also strive to revitalize the countryside. If rural undertakings can be developed, industry and commerce will easily rise. The prosperity of the city can be consolidated. This is also what those who talk about revitalization should pay attention to.</p>
<p>Our country was originally an agricultural country. At present, the operation of capitalist organizations in major cities is only in its rudimentary form. Most of its exported goods are raw materials. Among the raw materials, such as soybeans, leather, raw silk, and tea, are direct agricultural products or by-products, all derived from agricultural relations. In terms of the consumption of imported goods, they mostly go to rural areas and small cities close to rural areas. In Europe and North America, agricultural panic has clearly affected the entire national economy. How can cities develop if our countryside declines to such an extent? The so-called prosperity is equivalent to water without a source and hair without skin. Therefore, the fundamental source of disease in our country today lies in the countryside. However, if politics is not refreshed first, there will be many obstacles to the revitalization of the countryside. This is also what the authorities should know. Generally, people care about the prosperity of Shanghai and plan various prosperity strategies. Upon careful examination, most of the actual effects belong to temporary stimulation. Even if stimulation can lead to temporary prosperity, the market in Shanghai will dissipate as time passes and the situation changes, and it will remain as decadent as ever. Therefore, in the future, if you want to seek the prosperity of the Shanghai market, reorganize the Zhabei army, you must abandon the effect of temporary stimulation and strive to engage in the fundamental state. The revitalization of agriculture. Only then will the national economy be active. The national economy has a foundation. The ruins of big cities can be rebuilt. And prosperity can be ensured.</p>

<p>The river water continues to rise in light rain. The Five-Province Flood Prevention Conference will be held in Jiujiang. (Hankou) On the 18th, the river water rose six inches in light rain, reaching a water level of 42 feet 4 inches, 3 feet 3 inches higher than in the 20th year. Director Li Fan-yi of the Construction Bureau and Director Yang Si-lian of the Jianghan Engineering Bureau conferred on flood prevention measures. Li requested that they follow Chiang's order, with the Engineering Bureau responsible for engineering costs and the Construction Bureau responsible for reporting dangers and recruiting labor. Yang did not sign, and there was no result. Li then requested that Yang reply; otherwise, he would report to the headquarters for instructions. Yang is still considering.

<p>The British King and Queen happily welcome 2,000 guests. Litvinov's formal attire draws attention. (London) This afternoon, the British King and Queen opened a garden party at Windsor Palace to entertain representatives from various countries to the World Economic Conference. A giant gold and red tent was set up in the garden, which was used by King George in 1912 when he was crowned Emperor in Delhi, India. The King and Queen personally met 2,000 guests under the tent. Each representative was greeted with a smile and a few words. Members of the royal family were also mixed among the guests in the famous lawn. When Soviet Foreign Commissar Litvinov, wearing formal attire, arrived with Soviet Ambassador to London Maisky, it attracted much attention. American representatives, accompanied by their wives, arrived at the garden party after a tea party at the British Prime Minister's villa. (17th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) The British King and Queen held a garden party at Windsor Palace today, inviting more than two thousand representatives from various countries attending the World Economic Conference, creating a grand occasion. It was the first time the British King hosted foreign guests at Windsor Palace since the European War. When representatives from various countries attending the Economic Conference arrived, over a thousand people stood around the iron fence in front of the palace, hoping to catch a glimpse of their elegance. The railway authorities specially prepared trains for the representatives to ride, but most arrived by car. In the Windsor Palace garden, famous flowers bloomed and tall trees towered, creating beautiful scenery. Five tents were set up in the garden, with tea and snacks inside. Guards cavalry and the Welsh Guards took turns playing military music to entertain the guests. The King and Queen received foreign guests for an hour and a half. Chinese representative Song Ziwen was introduced by Guo Taiqi, and representatives from other countries were also introduced by their resident envoys.

<p>(Paris) After meeting with Commerce Minister Serre and Agriculture Minister Queuille, Prime Minister Daladier declared to the press, "From the beginning of the London Conference, the economic problems have been clearly defined, that is, various technical problems must be resolved after currency stability and the restoration of the gold standard. This is a preliminary necessary condition. If it cannot be achieved, then all economic measures will be absolutely ineffective. Moreover, the world's production and consumption situation has been greatly disturbed since the beginning of the economic panic. If various productions are not rationally organized in advance, then issues such as import quotas and tariff reductions cannot be discussed. Among various productions, we should start with basic products such as agricultural products like wheat, wine, and timber. Each exporting country should take measures to control production, but should obtain compensation from commercial agreements in exchange for reducing exports. In this way, we can implement regional compromises to encourage countries undergoing economic reorganization to reach compromises."</p>
<p>(New York) The French delegation submitted a memorandum to the Economic Committee of the Economic Conference, stating in its third section that the following products are related to all countries and should be subject to compromises reached by governments of all countries: (1) Agricultural products: wheat, wine, wool; (2) Industrial products: coal, copper, silver.</p>
<h3 id="e23">Japan's Attitude Towards Tax Reduction <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>Cannot unconditionally agree (Tokyo) Yesterday, the US representative proposed a 10% reduction in tariffs at the Economic Committee of the World Economic Conference. The Japanese Foreign Ministry holds the opinion that it cannot unconditionally agree. Although tariff reduction should be agreed to in principle, Japan's tariff rate is a single tax rate set in the 42nd year of Meiji, which is still maintained today during fierce tariff wars. Furthermore, from the perspective of actual trade, raw materials, which account for 50% of Japan's imports, are generally tax-free, and the tax rate on industrial products is also lower than in other countries. Especially recently, India and Egypt have imposed prohibitive tariffs on Japanese goods. Under these circumstances, it is still possible to say that Japan should raise its tax rate. If the current situation continues, it is impossible to unconditionally approve the US proposal. Even if the Economic Conference requires Japan to approve, it will resolutely instruct the Japanese representative to strongly argue its special circumstances and cannot unconditionally approve.

<p>(Berlin) Plank, a member of the German Colonial Veterans Association, published a statement saying, "The national government is convinced that Germany has the necessity to recover its colonies and should have the right to retain its former protectorates." The Posen Daily News published an article titled "We Should Not Forget Our Colonies," which continued, "The Japanese claim that even if their country withdraws from the League of Nations, it still has the right to retain its mandated territories in the Pacific Islands. This claim is contrary to justice. We believe that after the expiration of the mandate, Japan has no legal basis to claim its power. If Japan wants to maintain its mandated territories, it must conclude a special treaty with the League of Nations, and Germany's consent is essential, as Germany is a permanent member of the League of Nations Council." The report also stated, "If Germany's consent is desired, a condition must be met, that is, Germany must be able to actively participate in the mandated colonies in Africa." (17th Havas Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Moscow) Here, forty artistic charts showing the achievements of the first Five-Year Plan have been printed in English and French and compiled into a large volume. This book has been sent to the World Economic Conference in London for distribution to representatives. The book accurately shows the development of various sectors of the Soviet national economy. The tables used are based on accurate statistical reports, so the book will definitely enable the participating representatives to pay more attention to the speeches and declarations of the Soviet delegation. The organ paper of the People's Committee of Heavy Industry of the Soviet Union, "Industrialization," declared, "The appearance of this book will give Prime Minister MacDonald some subtle and practical revisions at the opening of the World Economic Conference." "Mr. MacDonald declared that a terrible panic is raging throughout the world, unemployment is soaring, and the living standards of the masses are declining. The whole world has been immersed in economic turmoil. However, what is said above is limited to the capitalist world. As for the Soviet Union ruled by the proletariat, it is completely different. Regarding this point, this book will prove it with the highest degree of accuracy."</p>

<p>Nine principles submitted to the Executive Yuan for discussion (Nanjing) The Ministry of Industry has prepared nine principles for the distribution of American cotton purchased with this loan, which have been submitted to the Executive Yuan for discussion. The main points are: 1. In order for the government to properly distribute the American cotton purchased with this loan and make the best use of it, the Ministries of Finance and Industry will appoint personnel to organize a committee to distribute the American cotton. 2. The distribution of American cotton should be based on the principle of meeting the exact needs of each yarn factory and ensuring that the inherent market of domestic cotton is not affected. 3. American cotton will be mainly distributed to yarn factories with sound organizations. 4. The price and repayment of American cotton used by yarn factories will be formulated by the committee and submitted to the Ministry for approval and forwarding to the Executive Yuan. 5. The repayment of yarn factories will be stored in a special bank account designated by the Executive Yuan. 6. The government will allocate some of the total price of American cotton to improve and research cotton production. 7. To promote the organization of cooperation between cotton textile industry production and sales, some of the loan will be allocated as funds. Under the guidance of the government, cooperative methods will be adopted to purchase raw materials and promote finished products. 8. In order to expand and improve the equipment of the textile industry and increase its efficiency, the Ministry of Industry previously presented and approved the borrowing of British Boxer Indemnity funds belonging to water conservancy projects to guarantee that Chinese manufacturers purchase yarn spindles and looms from the UK on credit. This case should be used in conjunction with the distribution of American cotton. (18th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Fan Qingsui, Director of the Daoqing Railway Bureau, said that the railway's business is not developed, and its revenue relies on coal transportation, with an average monthly revenue of more than 100,000 yuan. After rectification, the monthly revenue has reached 150,000 to 160,000 yuan. It is currently consulting with the Pinghan, Jinpu, and Longhai railways on joint transportation methods among the four railways. The original plan for the railway was to extend to Jinan, but due to funding reasons, it has not been built. The current debt to the British Fu Company is very large. In order to increase debt repayment capacity and develop business, it has been decided to find a way to extend to Jinan according to the original plan. However, due to the huge amount of funds required, it is planned to implement it in two phases. The first phase will first be built to Damingfu, which will require about 4 million yuan. The British Fu Company is willing to pay for the material costs. This trip to Beijing is to negotiate with the Ministry of Railways. The railway construction funds are not a problem and construction can begin soon. The second phase will then be extended to Jinan in order to further develop coal transportation. It has been found that the Daoqing Railway has two types of loans, both from the British Fu Company, including a road redemption loan of 800,000 pounds, a vehicle loan of more than 126,000 pounds, and a Qing Meng loan of more than 87,000 pounds, totaling more than 1 million pounds. The road redemption loan has not been repaid since 1926, and the vehicle loan has not paid interest since the second half of 1925 and has not been repaid since 1926. Fu Company recently urged repayment very urgently. After taking office, I have been saving 10% every month for interest payment. It is expected that 500,000 can be repaid by the end of this year. In the future, if the entire railway is extended, the revenue can be increased, and the amount of debt repayment can also be increased. It is said that due to the lack of consideration by the people in charge at the time, the Qing Meng loan has a very high interest rate. I am currently negotiating with the Ministry of Railways to cancel the previously signed contract. (18th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) China's state-owned railways have a foreign debt of more than 1.3 billion yuan, with the largest debt to Britain. The repayment method for each railway's debt to Britain is: the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway extracts 5% of its revenue each month for various debts, the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway extracts 10% of its revenue each month for debts, the Tianjin-Pukou Railway deposits 90,000 to 140,000 yuan each month for debts, the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway has set a monthly payment of 200 pounds for the commission owed to the Sino-British Company, and the Huguang loan has been allocated from salt tax revenue. The other railways are experiencing tight business income, and the Ministry of Railways is currently raising funds to avoid delays. It has been suggested that Britain pays the United States one-tenth of its war debt, and that China's debt to Britain can also be paid a certain amount by analogy, but the government does not adopt this view in order to respect foreign debt credit.

<p>Twelve Million Acres of Cotton Fields Destroyed Washington, 17th - According to official sources, the U.S. Department of Agriculture will announce a major cotton plan on Monday, attempting to eliminate 25% of cotton seedlings. Out of the current 40 million acres of cotton fields, 12 million acres will be destroyed and repurposed in order to reduce cotton harvests and deplete surplus cotton, restoring pre-war cotton prices. Farmers who eliminate cotton seedlings will receive government subsidies based on the number of acres destroyed. These subsidies will be funded by levying a handling tax on domestically consumed cotton, ranging from 2 to 4 cents per pound. Consequently, the cost of cotton fabrics will slightly increase, it is said.</p>

<p>Austrian Chancellor Returns to Vienna Reuters, Paris, 17th - It is learned that Austrian Chancellor Dollfuss made a stop in Paris on his way back to the country to lobby the French authorities for a loan, which was granted. Dollfuss met with French Prime Minister Daladier this afternoon, explaining how French support for the current Austrian government, preventing the National Socialist Party from seizing power in France, would be beneficial. Daladier readily agreed. Austria hopes to obtain a loan of 300,000,000 Austrian schillings. France will provide one-third of the loan. The issue date of the loan has not yet been determined, as the French government's decision requires formal approval from the Council of State.</p>
<p>Havas, Vienna, 17th - Chancellor Dollfuss recently returned to Austria from France by plane. Mrs. Dollfuss, the Minister of the Army Vaugoin, and other dignitaries all went to the airfield to welcome him.</p>
<p>Havas, Prague, 18th - Czech Foreign Minister Benes issued a statement to the London correspondent of the "Czech Capital Daily," stating in the first part that London has repeatedly expressed sympathy for Austria, and the whole world has shown friendship to Austria. He continued to say that the economic interests of the Danube countries do not conflict with each other. The former Austrian Empire, from an economic point of view, was a sound organization standing on a solid foundation. Sooner or later, the Danube countries must restore this unity from an economic perspective. He also pointed out three possibilities for Austria's current situation: (1) Austria joining hands with a major power, which would be opposed by European public opinion; (2) joining hands with another small Danube country; (3) cooperating with all Danube countries to form a Danube economic alliance. Benes believes that the third possibility is the most beneficial to Austria and can solve the Central European problem, as it would unite agricultural and industrial countries for mutual benefit. Benes finally expressed hope that the economic conference would solve the debt problems between governments, because if this problem is not solved, the solution to the currency stability problem will be hindered. Benes hopes to restore the gold standard first, then reduce tax rates. He concluded by saying that the countries of the Little Entente are prepared to expand the scope of economic agreements and broaden their friendships.</p>

Prime Minister Gömbös declared to the press that he intends to study various economic issues, especially to understand the new German system.</p>
<p>National News, Berlin, 7th - Today, Hungarian Prime Minister Gömbös suddenly arrived here by plane without any prior notice. Immediately after his arrival, Gömbös had a long conversation with German Prime Minister Hitler. The National Socialist Party's foreign policy group stated that the discussion was purely about economic and political issues between the two countries, but outside speculation is still rampant. There is also a rumor that Gömbös' visit is related to the restoration of the Hungarian monarchy, as some people want to make Otto, the eldest son of former Austrian King Charles, the King of Hungary. However, German political circles consider this rumor ridiculous, and Gömbös has repeatedly stated in the Hungarian Parliament that he does not support the Habsburg legitimist plan and believes that the Hungarian monarchy issue should be resolved at the appropriate time.</p>

A protest has been lodged. The government has instructed its ambassador to the Czech Republic to negotiate with the Czech authorities, stating that the ban on the distribution of all German newspapers is unprecedented in Czech-German relations and is contrary to the spirit of economic compromise.

In order to avoid demonstrations by Jews, the ex-Emperor has decided not to go there anymore. The Dutch government also secretly notified the ex-Emperor, saying that given the current political situation in Germany, please do not leave your residence. Regarding the German political situation, the ex-Emperor is currently taking a wait-and-see attitude.

<h3 id="e67">Japan's Financial Difficulties <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>Tax Increase Inevitable for Next Year's Budget Dentsu, Tokyo, 18th - The total amount of next year's budget is feared to be no lower than this year's due to the navy's second supplementary plan, the army's armament improvement costs, the Manchurian Incident expenses, and the relief of the current situation. Finance Minister Takahashi is forced to issue deficit bonds in order to pay for these expenses. However, based on the resolution of the last parliament, the government has a responsibility to carefully consider in order to establish a financial plan. It is also necessary to research and investigate the military's enthusiastic tax increase theory. Therefore, the current tax system revision preparation committee is eager to make a case to be decided by the finance minister. Next year's budget will implement a partial tax increase in an effort to make up for the revenue shortfall. As for the investigation items listed by the committee, if the scope of tax system reform extends to income tax and monopoly enterprises, it will spread to the entire existing tax and monopoly system. The focus of the problem is on the extent of the recovery of the economy and the room for tax increases, as well as the target of tax increases. But on these two points, the ultimate question is how much to increase revenue. As for the authorities in charge of the Ministry of Finance, they have the following two goals: to prioritize regular expenditures based on discussions of regular revenue, and to fill the gap between regular expenditures and regular revenue with tax increases. The interest on bonds issued for the so-called emergency budget will rely entirely on tax increases. However, in order to achieve the above goals, it is more convenient to increase cigarette and postal rates and implement a new sales tax, but it is hoped that the root of taxes such as income tax and inheritance tax will be touched.</p>
<p>Japan Alliance News, Tokyo, 18th - The Ministry of the Army's planned budget for next year has now exceeded 500 million yen, including 160 million yen for the army's regular budget, 130 million yen for the Manchurian Incident expenses, and 250 million yen for armament maintenance costs. The Ministry of Finance's handling of such huge army expenses is particularly noteworthy.</p>

<h3 id="e71">Puppet Army Occupies Eight Counties in Hebei <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>Demanding Reorganization of 10,000 Troops Still Stationed in Luan River East, Political Council Decides to Have He and Huang Conduct Precise Negotiations Beiping Special Dispatch - The puppet troops of Li Jichun, Zhao Lei, and others, under the protection of the Japanese army, occupy various places east and west of the Luan River, from Qinhuangdao in the east to near Lutai in the west, totaling eight counties in Hebei Province: Linyu, Changli, Funing, Qian'an, Lulong, Luanzhou, Ninghe, and part of Fengrun. Li Jichun and others have established pseudo-organizations such as military halls and political affairs halls in Qinhuangdao, Tangshan, and other places, issuing orders and appointing county magistrates and chiefs of public security bureaus, acting as local administrative chiefs and creating a special force. This is a major obstacle after the withdrawal of the Japanese army. The authorities are paying unusual attention to this matter. When the truce agreement was signed in Tanggu, Chinese and Japanese representatives discussed it once. The Japanese representative did not recognize it as related to them and refused to take responsibility for ringing the bell to untie it, but agreed that after the agreement was established, the two sides would have friendly private contacts. However, since the establishment of the agreement, the Japanese side has continued to feign ignorance and has not shown sincerity, intending to maintain its strength for future use. At the same time, Li Jichun and others hope to be incorporated by the authorities and stationed in Luan River East. Recently, the Japanese army has gradually withdrawn, and the resolution of the puppet army problem is imminent. Therefore, active efforts are being made to seek an early end so that the lost territories can be received in accordance with the agreement. On the one hand, the authorities have concrete contacts with the Japanese representative, Military Officer Nagatsu, and on the other hand, the puppet army has also sent representatives to Tianjin, hoping for incorporation, and Zhang Ting'e and others are running around to help. The puppet army's goal is to achieve two points: first, be reorganized by the authorities and retain 10,000 troops; second, still be stationed in Luan River East and not be transferred elsewhere. Regarding the issue of incorporation, the authorities were initially very insistent, but now, due to factual constraints, they have shown leniency, but only allowing the reorganization of 5,000 troops, because the actual number of puppet troops is only 5,000 to 6,000. If they are allowed to reorganize into 10,000 troops, they will inevitably recruit bandits and rogues to make up the number, which will make future reorganization more difficult. As for still being stationed in Luan River East, the abuses are even worse, and it is impossible to agree to this. There are various policies that are difficult to resolve. The Japanese side, since Nagatsu's meeting with He, after detailed discussions, has expressed a solution to our side's opinions and agreed to assist in finding a solution within the possible range. In recent days, the opinions of both sides seem to be very close. Our side means that as long as the Japanese side does not interfere, then suppression and pacification will be easy to handle. At the crucial moment of withdrawal and reception, it is hoped to achieve a satisfactory result as soon as possible to avoid hindering the implementation of the agreement. According to official sources, a suitable solution has now been drafted, and it may be resolved soon. What the specific solution is remains to be seen.</p>
<p>Yesterday morning (16th), Hebei Province Chairman Yu Xuezhong came to Beiping from Tianjin. At 11:30 AM, accompanied by Han Fuqu and others, he discussed military and political affairs in North China with He and Huang at Fengzeyuan. This matter was also brought up for discussion. According to Yu's remarks, the puppet army's disposal issue is that Li Jichun and others hope for two points: (1) be incorporated by us and retain 10,000 troops; (2) still be stationed in Luan River East. After our investigation, the number of puppet troops is less than 10,000. If their request is granted, they will recruit bandits to make up the number of 10,000, which will make future reorganization more difficult. Therefore, it is planned to reorganize them into 5,000 troops. As for their request to still be stationed in Luan River East, it hinders local tax revenue and administrative reorganization, which is impossible to allow and still needs to be considered. The Luan River war zone must wait for the puppet army issue to be resolved before it can be received. After the agreement is received in accordance with the agreement, our administrative power can directly reach Yuguan. After the restoration of Beining, the train to Yuguan will naturally have no problem. Recently, the Japanese Kwantung Army took over a section of the railway between Tangshan and Shanhaiguan. Their purpose is not to occupy it for a long time, because a part of the Kwantung Army is still stationed in Tangshan, so this move was taken. When our side receives it, it must be returned. The Japanese army in Tongdong has withdrawn in separate routes to the Sanhe Zunhua area. A small number of Japanese troops are still stationed in Foxinzhuang and other places. The Japanese army on the north road has also concentrated from the Shunyi area to Gubeikou. In the areas where the Japanese army has withdrawn, because the special police have not yet been organized, the local public security police have temporarily maintained order. Once the special police organization is completed, it will be formally received. The special police will be organized by the Hebei Provincial Government. At this moment, due to the establishment relationship, it has not yet started. In terms of the number of people, in order to save expenses, it will be based on maintaining local security. Among the 19 county magistrates in the lost counties, except for two county magistrates who only sent telegrams when the county fell and did not report to the province, which is tantamount to absconding, the remaining 17 county magistrates have reported. After the reception, the county magistrates who lost their entire territory, such as Zunhua, Qian'an, Lulong, etc., will be replaced by others. The county magistrates whose territories were not completely lost and have no faults will still be held by the original county magistrates. The candidates have all been assigned and will go to take over the posts at the time of reception. The market in Tianjin has now gradually become peaceful, and the curfew time has been shortened to 11:00 PM every night. The reason why it has not been lifted is that there are still a few leaders of plainclothes teams active in Tianjin. This morning, the Political Reorganization Committee was established and convened its first meeting. Yu Xuezhong also raised this matter, and after discussion, it was decided that He and Huang would still conduct accurate negotiations with the Japanese representative Nagatsu to resolve it satisfactorily in the shortest possible time.

<p>According to the Tokyo Hochi Shimbun of June 12, since the establishment of the Sino-Japanese Truce Agreement, the "Manchukuo"'s public security maintenance countermeasures have shifted from domestic to border defense. Based on the Japan-Manchukuo Protocol, the Kwantung Army bears full responsibility for the "Manchukuo"'s national defense and domestic public security maintenance. Now, in order to fulfill its responsibilities, it is actively planning the liaison and control of the military and police forces of Japan and "Manchukuo." At present, both sides have decided on a concrete control plan, the contents of which are as follows: (1) The orders for the military and police forces of Japan and Manchukuo should be unified, that is, to cooperate in action in the event of an emergency. (2) Regarding the defense of Manchukuo inside and outside the country, the Japanese army stationed in the area should guide the "Manchukuo" military and police, so that the two armies of Japan and Manchukuo can be easily controlled. Under these two major objectives, the Japanese army will soon implement a decentralized deployment of forces in Manchuria. The method is as follows: 1. In the central part, a Central Public Security Maintenance Committee will be organized with the commanders of the Kwantung Army and the heads of the "Manchukuo" military, political, and civil affairs departments as members. 2. In the four northeastern provinces, a small Public Security Maintenance Committee will be organized with the commanders of the Japanese garrison army and the heads of the "Manchukuo" military and police agencies as members. (3) In each county in the four northeastern provinces, a county Public Security Maintenance Committee will be organized in the same way as the previous item. The above committees are scheduled to be established on June 10 to take charge of domestic and foreign public security, but the command of the highest control agency belongs to the commander of the Kwantung Army. If an emergency occurs, the Kwantung Army can issue orders to enable the Japanese and Manchukuo military and police forces throughout Manchuria to take the necessary actions. This kind of control organization is, in fact, the most important mechanism ever established by Japan in the mainland.</p>
<h3 id="e73">An Uproar Suddenly Arises: Huo Weizhou Assassinated <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>According to a Beiping special dispatch, Huo Weizhou, who published a statement in the newspaper in April renouncing his membership in the Youth Party, was assassinated by assailants claiming personal grudges, all of whom escaped. Today (the 17th), an assassination case occurred at the Xidan Arch in Beiping. The circumstances are quite bizarre. The deceased, named Huo Weizhou, was a current member of the Northeast People's Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association. Huo had previously joined the Chinese Youth Party and declared his withdrawal from the party with Wang Jiexia and others in April. Whether this contains political overtones is unknown. The details of Huo's assassination are recorded in detail below:</p>
<p>The Moment of Death at Xidan Arch: In recent years, Xidan Arch has been home to many schools, and many institutions have also been established in the western city. As the population has grown, the market has become increasingly lively. Recently, peace talks have been concluded, and people's hearts have been stabilized. All kinds of businesses have returned to their former glory. Every day, the area around Xidan is bustling with activity, and the streets are crowded with vehicles, with no trace of the desolation of wartime. At around 11:00 AM today, just as the personnel of various institutions were leaving work and students from various schools were returning home for lunch, the streets were filled with the sounds of traffic and people. Suddenly, several gunshots rang out. Most people were unaware of the truth and fled in panic. For a moment, people were stunned and looked around, suspecting that disaster had struck. The police on duty rushed forward to investigate and found a person shot dead in a rickshaw, covered in blood and already lifeless. The deceased was wearing a blue Zhongshan suit, white trousers, floral socks, and yellow leather shoes, and appeared to be about thirty years old. He had been shot three times. The assailant was a young man wearing a gray military uniform. The location was just outside the Wugongwei Hutong, north of Xidan. The east side of the road was the Dongsanyi South Goods Store. As the deceased passed by in the rickshaw, the assailant suddenly emerged from the side of the road, pulled out a pistol from his chest, and fired three shots. At the same time, there were two other people, each with a pistol, guarding from the side. One was in plain clothes, and the other was in military uniform, both also in their twenties. Seeing that their goal had been achieved, the shooter first seized a bicycle in front of the Dongsanyi store, rode away quickly, and escaped in different directions with the other two. The police officer directing traffic chased after them. The young man heard the sound of footsteps and turned around to shout at the pursuer, "We are all from the National Salvation Association. We killed him because we had a grudge. It's none of your business!" After speaking, he increased his speed and fled. The chase continued all the way to Li Gelao Hutong before they disappeared without a trace. Fan Guorong, the patrol officer of the 7th section of the 2nd district, arrived with many detectives and inquired with the rickshaw puller, named Li Delin. The deceased hired the rickshaw outside Fengsheng Hutong, without bargaining. He stated that he wanted to go to the old Ministry of Justice Street, where the Fengtian Conference, i.e., the Northeast Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association, was located. A business card was then found on the deceased, with the name Huo Weizhou on it. Since the deceased's name was unknown, a telegram was sent to the National Salvation Association to inquire. He Zhenli, an official from the association, rushed to the scene with more than twenty colleagues. After identifying the body, it was confirmed to be Huo. Yin Huanran, the head of the 2nd district, also arrived after hearing the news and asked Cheng about the truth. Cheng said that it was an internal matter of the National Salvation Association and refused to say anything else. Unable to get any leads, he ordered his subordinates to step up the arrest of the murderer. He also took Cheng Zhenli and the rickshaw puller to the district to investigate the case. The body was transported in the original rickshaw to the mouth of Shihutong Hutong and placed in the shade of a locust tree. The head was still wearing a French-style white helmet. The corpse was stiff, sitting upright in the rickshaw. The situation was extremely tragic. When reporters went to investigate, they were guarded by police officers and Huo's friends. Huo's friend said, "The content is too complicated, I can't say, I can't say." The situation inside is difficult for outsiders to understand.</p>
<p>Orphans and Widows: Huo was from Kaiyuan County, Liaoning, and was 32 years old. He lived at No. 1, Dingwangfu Street, Jia Lane, in Beiping. This morning, he went to the South Barracks of the Xisipailou to visit a friend. After finishing his business, he went to Fengsheng Hutong and hired a rickshaw. He also had a pistol with him, seemingly for self-defense, but he didn't have time to use it to resist. He leaves behind a wife, surnamed Xiang, who is 35 years old, four sons, and one daughter. The eldest daughter is 15 years old, and the oldest son is only 12 years old. All are studying in Beiping. Xiang, after receiving a report from a friend, took her young son to the scene of the death to identify the body and wailed loudly, extremely saddened. After being persuaded to stop, she was mentally disturbed and her words were incoherent. When reporters asked how he died, she only shook her head and did not answer. Then she said, "He hasn't been home for three or four days. I am completely unaware." She also said to Huo's friend, "Why didn't you accompany him?" The friend also replied that he hadn't seen him for three or four days. Then, she was helped to rest inside the National Salvation Association, still crying non-stop. Around 2 PM, Ye E, a prosecutor from the local court, and a coroner arrived to examine the body. It was determined that Huo had a bullet in his back that passed through his chest, and two bullets entered his abdomen and did not exit. It was confirmed that he had been shot to death. The coroner immediately filled out the death certificate. Huo's family prepared a coffin and funerary clothes and completed the encoffining around 6 PM. The coffin was carried by sixteen people to a temple outside Xuanwumen for temporary storage. Huo graduated from Beijing Higher Normal School. He served as the Secretary-General and Political Minister of Feng Yong University in Shenyang, and the Telegraph Secretary of the Beining Railway. He had deep research in social economics. He was the editor-in-chief of the "Oriental Public Opinion Weekly" in Shen. After the September 18th Shenyang Incident, he came to Peiping with his family and served as a professor at Fu Jen Catholic University and Normal University, editor of the "Diplomacy Monthly," and a standing member of the Northeast People's Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association. He is the author of "Isolated Japan" and "Japan's Policy Towards China."</p>
<p>"The Cultivation of a Great Statesman," "Foreign Policy," "Modern Diplomacy," "Biographies of Modern Diplomats," and other papers. His recent work, "Saving China from Calamity," is still in print. He had no savings and left behind a desolate situation.</p>
<p>Declaration of Withdrawal from the Party: Huo was a well-known figure in the Nationalist faction. On April 18th of this year, he and Wang Jiexia published a notice in the newspaper declaring their withdrawal from the party. Soon after, the party also published a statement in the newspaper. Although this is unrelated to the events described in this article, it was a major event in Huo's life before his death. The original text of Huo's notice is as follows: "Notice from Wang Jiexia, Huo Weizhou, and 1,568 others: We deeply mourn the loss of our country and home and are determined to abandon party views and pledge not to compromise with Japan. Therefore, we resolutely withdraw from the Youth Party and are willing to work with those who are loyal to the country to resist foreign aggression. Although we dare not imitate Kemal's withdrawal from the party to save the country, we also admire Madano's sacrifice of private interests for the public good. As for detailed opinions, a separate statement of withdrawal will be submitted. We hope that all circles will examine it with favor." The original text of the Youth Party's notice is as follows: "Notice from the Chinese Youth Party: It has been found that Wang Jiexia and Huo Weizhou, who were previously expelled from the party, have recently spread rumors and slandered the party, intending to arouse suspicion among people in society about the party. Such despicable means are obvious to discerning people. Since its establishment ten years ago, the party has always adhered to the purpose of eliminating national traitors internally and resisting powerful forces externally. Since the loss of the Northeast, the party has been determined to restore it. Comrades who have sacrificed their lives in the anti-Japanese battles in Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, Rehe, and Shanghai are countless. Even now, those who are fighting the enemy at the front are also all over the army divisions and brigades. These are all obvious facts that have long been known at home and abroad. How can one or two villains slander them? Furthermore, there are those who use traitors to attempt to undermine the party, which is even more intolerable to the party members. This matter concerns the reputation of hundreds of thousands of people. It is hoped that all circles will understand this. Sincerely, the Tianjin Special City Branch of the Chinese Youth Party. (June 17th)"</p>
<h3 id="e74">The Rampant Banditry of the Sichuan Bandits <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>Occupying Three Counties in Northern Sichuan and Organizing a Puppet Government. Shaanxi Bandits Fleeing to Northern Hubei, General Fan Ordered to Intercept. Rampant Local Bandits in Western Hubei Gradually Suppressed. Hankou Dispatch: Xu Xiangqian's remaining bandits, taking advantage of the conflict between Liu and Deng, returned to Shaanxi in a big way and invaded Sichuan. The troops of Tian Songyao, Liu Cunhou, and others were unable to resist, leading to the re-fall of Nanjiang and Bazhong into bandit hands. A few days ago, it was reported that Tongjiang had also fallen, and Wanyuan was also in danger. Tian's troops bore the brunt of the bandit onslaught and suffered heavy losses. No less than two brigades of Zeng and Luo's divisions were disarmed. After occupying three counties in northern Sichuan, the bandits organized the so-called Sichuan-Shaanxi Provincial Soviet Government, engaged in communist propaganda, and coerced the masses to add the Third Army of Eastern Sichuan to their ranks, with Yan Deji and Wang Weizhou serving as the commander and deputy commander, respectively. The power of the Red bandits increased day by day. Tian Songyao and Liu Cunhou, seeing the rampant banditry, increased their troops to firmly defend the key passes, fortified their walls and cleared the fields, and waited for the bandits. Before long, the bandits launched their main force to attack Tian's army in the Changchi Sanjiang Dam area, resulting in three days and nights of fierce fighting with no clear victor. The newly formed Third Army of Eastern Sichuan advanced towards Suiding and Xuanhan, dividing into three routes to attack Zhuyu Pass. The middle route headed towards Hao'ezi, the left wing towards Hanwang Pass, and the right wing towards Zhuyuan Dam, making contact with Liu's army. Liu's troops, with the advantage of waiting for the enemy, are said to have won a victory once. A faction of the bandits in southern Shaanxi, due to delaying the rescue of He Long, recently pressed towards northern Hubei, intending to occupy Yunxi, Guanghua, Fangxian, and Zhushan counties, to unite with Kuang's bandits in the east and support He's bandits in the south. The Hankou headquarters has ordered Fan Shisheng's troops to thoroughly intercept and suppress them. All county militias are under his command to assist in the defense. According to Fan's telegram, he has already made perfect arrangements as ordered. The majority of the bandits' elite have entered Sichuan, and those remaining in Shaanxi are mostly a ragtag group, unlikely to cross the Lei River. After Liu Zhenhua arrived in Huang'an, Kuang's bandits once again broke up into smaller groups, moving covertly day and night. Bandits are everywhere in the counties of eastern Hubei and southern Henan. However, the whereabouts of their main force are nowhere to be found. The local people also refuse to speak the truth, while the army's movements are clearly known by the Red bandits, indicating that the communist influence is deep-rooted and cannot be thoroughly eradicated merely by relying on military force. He's bandits in western Hubei were originally in a desperate situation. Recently, they were attacked by Xu Yuanquan's troops and attempted to flee to Sichuan and Hunan. On the one hand, they attempted to gather local bandits from various counties to strengthen their forces, as a last-ditch effort. There have always been many local bandits in western Hubei. If they are colluded with, it would be enough to divide our army's strength. In addition, there are also local bandits, who have recently become rampant. They have been discovered in Yichang, Xingshan, and Lichuan. In Lichuan, Zhang Gang's troops are encircling and suppressing them, but they have not yet been annihilated. The bandits in Yichang and Xingshan have been suppressed, and the bandit nest at Dayun Cave has also been destroyed. The bandit leader, Yu Yinghui, was killed on the spot, and Yang Zhenggang and Wang Shizhen were captured alive and executed. The remaining bandits fled and are no longer a threat. (16th)</p>
<h3 id="e75">The 19th Route Army's Anti-Japanese Vanguard Detour Through Guangdong Province to Return to Fujian <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>Two Columns Returning to Yuantan, Departing via the East River. A Glimpse of Chen Mingshu and Jiang Guangding's Visit to Guangdong. Two Regiments of the Guangxi Army Entering Guangdong Have Arrived in Southern Jiangxi. Guangzhou Dispatch: Since the news of the ceasefire in the north reached southern China, the anti-Japanese army departing from the southwest abruptly stopped its advance. The two columns of the 19th Route Army's anti-Japanese vanguard, after arriving in Chenzhou, were ordered to return south, re-entering Guangdong in order to return to Fujian via the old route. It was found that the two columns had already passed Lechang on the 10th of this month and returned to Shaozhou. On the 11th, the 4th Regiment of the army arrived in Shaozhou first and stayed in Shaozhou for one night. On the morning of the 12th, they took the Guangzhou-Shaoguan train to Yuantan Station. The remaining regiments, the 2nd, 3rd, and 1st, were also prepared with more than 30 trains and successively concentrated in Yuantan from Shaozhou. By the evening of the 14th, the transportation was completed. On the 15th, the Shaozhou-Guangzhou freight and passenger trains resumed normal operation. It is reported that the army will follow the original route from Yuantan in northern Guangdong, detour through Huaxian, Conghua, Longmen, Heyuan, Xingning, and Meixian, and return to the Fujian border. The commanders of the two columns of the army personally led the troops to develop the area along the way. Also, because Chen Mingshu and Jiang Guangnai had already gone to Hong Kong via Guangdong, it was inconvenient for them to come to the provincial capital to show themselves, so they are still in the army. As for Chen and Jiang's recent arrival in Guangdong from Fujian, outsiders believed that they must have had an important mission. However, before they could even warm their seats in Guangzhou, they quietly left. It was found that Chen and Jiang arrived in the provincial capital on the 8th. Chen stayed in Guangzhou for one night and took the Guangzhou-Hong Kong Taishan ship to Hong Kong the next morning (the 9th), while Jiang Guangnai returned to his hometown of Dongguan County on the afternoon of the 10th and took the Guangzhou-Kowloon express train to Hong Kong on the evening of the 11th, living in the same place as Chen. As a result, rumors arose. All sectors in Guangdong were prepared to warmly welcome Jiang Guangnai this time, as his achievements in the anti-Japanese war in Shanghai had long been praised by the people of Guangdong. Therefore, the enthusiasm of all sectors towards Jiang stemmed from their love for Jiang, the national hero. Unexpectedly, Jiang returned to his hometown on the day after arriving in Guangdong and then went to Hong Kong, declining all welcoming meetings prepared by various groups. Although this was due to Jiang's quiet nature, Jiang and Chen's hasty arrival and departure in Guangdong without expressing any attitude showed their disappointment. Since there is no news of Chen and Jiang returning to Guangdong, and the Guangdong government also has no intention of welcoming them, it seems that the future of the relationship between Fujian and the political situation in the southwest is unpredictable. Now, the 19th Route Army's vanguard is detouring back to Fujian, stationed in Yuantan. And the 4th Independent Division of the Guangdong Anti-Japanese Army, which departed with the 19th Route Army's vanguard a few days ago, also followed behind after the 19th Route Army's vanguard passed Lechang and returned. The division withdrew from Lechang on the 12th and returned to Shaoguan. The vanguard arrived in Shaozhou on the 13th. After concentrating in Shaozhou, they will ask the authorities for instructions on their next move. As for the Guangxi Anti-Japanese Suppression Communist Army, which departed to Guangdong a few days ago, it has now turned into the Jiangxi border. Ling Yaoxi's regiment has arrived in Longnan, and Long Zhenyi's regiment departed from Nanxiong on the 12th and went to Qiannan via the Weng Da Highway Pass. In the future, the three southern counties of Jiangxi will have two regiments of the Guangxi army added to the two regiments of Wang Zanbin's division, for a total of four regiments, all under Wang's command.

<h3 id="e76">The Guangdong Province's Government Expenses Increase Sharply <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>The budget for the 21st year is more than 10 million more than the budget for the 20th year. The new budget for the 22nd year falls short by about 30 million. Another three-year plan budget requires more than 57 million. Guangzhou Dispatch: Guangdong Province has recently become the center of southwestern politics. There are more special agencies than usual, and representatives from all parties are gathered in Guangdong. The authorities are overwhelmed, and the expenditure on other items has also increased day by day. Therefore, the expenditure on administrative expenses in the 21st year has increased by more than 10 million compared to the 20th year. Among them, in addition to more than 4 million in assistance fees, administrative expenses increased by 2.79 million, accounting for the largest number. The approximate increase is as follows: Administrative expenses: 5.66 million, an increase of 2.79 million in the 21st year; Judicial expenses: 1.884 million, an increase of 147,000 yuan; Financial expenses: 1.614 million, an increase of 237,000 yuan; Education and cultural expenses: 2.988 million, an increase of 210,000 yuan; Agricultural and mining expenses: 730,000, an increase of 640,000 yuan; Construction expenses: 3.3 million, an increase of 2.28 million yuan; Assistance fees: 4.374 million yuan. The total increase is 10.0678 million yuan. According to a public report by the financial authorities yesterday, the budget proposals for the 22nd year of national and provincial agencies have been compiled and submitted to the Southwestern Political Affairs Council and the Guangdong Provincial Government for review. In order to consolidate the budget, the Finance Department has specially requested that the funds needed for the three-year administration be separately budgeted to clarify the situation. The total estimated expenditure for the 22nd year of national and provincial expenses is about 120.36988 million silver dollars. The total estimated revenue for the 22nd year of national and provincial tax revenue is about 90 million silver dollars. Although the revenue has broken historical records, due to the sharp increase in expenditure compared to the previous year, the revenue and expenditure are still about 30 million short. If the expenditure is not tightened as much as possible during the review, it may be impossible to cope. The total budget for the implementation of the three-year administration plan for the 23rd year is 57.49923 million silver dollars, a very large amount. Combined with the budgets of various agencies, the expenditure budget for the 22nd year is 177.869112 million yuan, an extremely large number. Therefore, the funds for this three-year plan must be raised separately on the one hand, and the priorities and urgency must be weighed separately to ensure the suitability of financial resources.

<h3 id="e77">The German Economy Under the Rule of the National Socialist Party (German Dispatch) <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>When Hitler was in opposition, he touted so-called economic policies such as overthrowing the system of interest slavery. Since the National Socialist Party organized the cabinet, the actual economic policies implemented have not been what he advocated as an opposition party, but rather the economic policies of the previous Papen cabinet. As for the "standardization" that runs through his entire policy, according to Hitler himself, the concept of "standardization" is not a feudal concept, but rather a concept of "efficiency" first, that is, to maximize the efficiency of general work. What is manifested in politics is an extremely centralized dictatorial politics. Such politics lacks historical origins in neighboring countries and is difficult to fully develop. However, Germany has been influenced by long-term militarism and has been severely oppressed by the victorious countries' Treaty of Versailles after the war, so the reaction is very strong. In particular, the middle class masses, being both oppressed by the wealthy and feeling the coercion of foreign forces, rose up to support the National Socialist Party. Moreover, the Prussian landowners also felt their own difficulties, and the heavy industrial capitalists also thought that foreign capital was terrible. Therefore, they exerted their militaristic courage to seek independence. All national, economic, and political facilities are carrying out a centralized dictatorship under the banner of "standardization." For example, after the establishment of the Hitler government, it even abolished the political powers of the various federal governments and replaced them with methods similar to county governments, with representatives of the central government exercising these powers. Thus, whether in substance or in appearance, the form of dictatorship has been realized.</p>
<p>In the economic aspect, the so-called control policy is implemented in all industrial sectors throughout Germany, and the National Socialist Party takes care of it all. Red activities, of course, have become completely underground. Although there is still a potential force among the working class that cannot be underestimated, they have become accustomed to being legal parties since the promulgation of the Weimar Constitution, and they are bound to be unable to breathe for a while under such strong political oppression. In fact, not only is the red activity like this, but the trade union office under the Social Democratic Party, which has turned from revolution to social policy, was also occupied by the National Socialist Party the day before yesterday (May 2nd). The trade union cadres were all arrested, and the trade union's property was confiscated. In the future, the National Socialist Party will come out to direct the trade union activities. Needless to say, all the confiscated property of the red trade unions and the yellow trade unions has become the property of the National Socialist Party.</p>
<p>In order to implement the standardization of the economic world, the Hitler government has appointed a supervisor to each industrial sector to improve the industrial organization. The actual performance is the so-called protection of industry and commerce policy, which is to provide low-interest loans from the central bank. For example, recently, it is planned to release 100 million marks for repairing factory buildings, and 15 million marks for protecting handicrafts. The oil and fat industry, which has a special relationship with the current Minister of Agriculture Hugenberg, will be given a large subsidy to implement a monopoly.</p>
<p>It is also said that in order to protect small and medium-sized businesses, the taxes that were previously levied on general stores are now levied on department stores. Everyone knows that this is shifting the burden to consumers. However, the tax reduction law for homeowners and landowners, which was originally scheduled to end this year, has been extended for another year. As for solving the unemployment problem, the only method is to expel Jews and replace them with Germans. As for foreigners, of course, there is no chance to find work in Germany. However, the number of unemployed in April was still more than 5.5 million.</p>
<p>What is the achievement of the Hitler government's economic policy? The easiest thing to understand is the number of import trade. However, Hitler advocates extreme protection trade policies, so all foreign trade reciprocity treaties will be abolished immediately when they expire in order to increase tariffs. Therefore, after the expiration of the German-French trade supplementary agreement, tariffs were immediately increased on French goods imported into Germany. Tariffs were also increased on food imports from Yugoslavia. Naturally, increasing tariffs in this way will cause retaliation against the country. Therefore, Germany's foreign trade, whether import or export, has shown a decrease in recent statistics. The decrease in industrial manufactured goods may be a good phenomenon, but the decrease in foodstuffs is not necessarily a blessing for the German people. Maintaining the original number of raw materials is somewhat beneficial to Germany. However, the export aspect is very worthy of attention, because Germany is a country that relies on trade exports to cultivate market prosperity. In the three months from January to March of this year, its exports exceeded the total by only 105 million marks, while in the three months from September to December of last year, its exports exceeded the total by 234 million marks. Compared with the spring of this year, it is more than half as much, then the future of trade is mostly pessimistic. The effect of the National Socialist Party's economic policy can also be seen generally. (May 5, 1933, in Berlin)</p>

<p>The Songjiang Grand Theater uses its own motors and generators to show movies, which are managed by Jiang Defu, who is skilled in machinery. The performances have always been very successful. Today (the 18th) is Sunday, and there are usually two screenings during the day. Because there was already a screening for military and police officers in the morning, Jiang Defu, finding the lighting was dim, inspected the engine after the screening. He removed the belt and made some repairs. At that time, the electricians were eating, and only Jiang was working inside. After the repairs were completed, he put the belt back on. Because it was not properly aligned, he tried to start the machine. Jiang kicked the belt with his foot, hoping to get it on the shaft. Unexpectedly, he accidentally put his foot in the gap of the wheel. As the machine started, he was dragged and thrown about. Jiang was extremely frightened and shouted for someone to cut the belt. No one heard him. When the workers finished their meal and entered, they saw that Jiang was unconscious, with blood everywhere. They immediately called the people in the theater to pull him down, but he was already dying. Dr. Ke Deqiong and Dr. Feng Youlu were called to the theater, but it was too late to save him. He had died from his injuries. Most of his ribs were broken, and his chest was crushed by the machine. His death was extremely tragic. After someone told his elderly mother, wife, and children, they rushed to the scene and cried uncontrollably. The onlookers were all saddened. In addition to announcing the temporary suspension of the day's screenings, the theater is also raising funds to take care of Jiang Defu's family. Jiang was in his prime and left behind an elderly mother, a wife, and three young children who all relied on him for their livelihood. His tragic death is truly pitiful.</p>

<p>The spring silkworm harvest this year was very good, so farmers are preparing to raise too many autumn silkworms, hoping to get lucky. In fact, this is very dangerous. The county party headquarters, the county chamber of commerce, and other agencies and organizations in this county have jointly telegraphed the Construction Department, ordering the silk reeling mills to limit the amount of silk, so as to avoid danger. Yesterday, Yuan Shuzhi, the director of the Farmers Bank, printed a flyer warning farmers not to raise too many autumn silkworms and sent it to the county government, requesting that it be forwarded to the district and township offices for wide dissemination.</p>

<h3 id="e85">Repercussions of Rugao County Magistrate's Arbitrary Arrest of School Principal <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>The Rugao County Magistrate Zhao Jingyuan illegally arrested Shen, the principal of Rugao Normal School, and Zhu, the director of discipline. This was previously reported in this newspaper. According to an investigation by officials sent by the provincial government, the county magistrate handled the matter poorly, was flustered and negligent beforehand, causing the communist-leaning students to flee in alarm. Afterwards, he blamed the principal of Rugao Normal School and Director Zhu of discipline, arresting them arbitrarily and detaining them at the Public Security Brigade headquarters, publicly insulting them. The entire educational community of the province was extremely indignant upon hearing this news and has been demanding that the school principals petition the provincial government to severely punish the illegal County Magistrate Zhao. Yesterday (the 17th), Cao Chu, Zhang Haicheng, Tao Yun, Huang Zhifu, Zheng Xigu, Hu Huanyong, and Zhou Houchu, all standing committee members of the Provincial Secondary School Joint Association, gathered in the provincial capital for discussion. They believe that the county magistrate is ignorant of the administrative system, abused his power by illegally arresting the principal of a provincial normal school, intentionally insulted the personality of the entire provincial educational community, and openly disregarded the authority of the provincial government. They will present their case to the provincial government, requesting that the county magistrate be removed from office and investigated to maintain the dignity of education. Director Zhou of the Education Department believes that the county magistrate has indeed violated the law and will be punished according to the law after the truth is verified. It is reported that the school principals and others regard this unfortunate incident as an unprecedented disgrace to the educational community and an egregious example of local administrative officials infringing upon provincial education. They are extremely indignant and united in their determination to resign unless the county magistrate is immediately removed from office and investigated. It is also reported that the Provincial Secondary School Faculty Association will also hold a meeting to express their support, and the situation is about to escalate significantly.</p>

<p>Wu Fushou, a farmer from Baofu Township, Wangdian, Jiaxing, is 28 years old. He married Pan Linnan from a nearby village at the age of 19. Their relationship was generally good. Because Wu's family was poor, he often went out to work as a hired hand. Linnan, not used to sleeping alone, had an affair with Zhou A'nan from the neighborhood. This time, when Wu returned home to recuperate, his wife angrily ran away. On the afternoon of the 16th, Zhou A'nan prepared wine and food and invited people to a feast at Wu's house. Wu also took a seat. After being repeatedly urged to drink, he became drunk and fell asleep on the bed. Late that night, Zhou, together with Wu's mother-in-law, surnamed Pan, and his wife, Changguan, broke into Wu's room, held down Wu's hands and feet, and Zhou used a kitchen knife to slash at him. Wu awoke in pain and cried for help, struggling desperately. He crawled to the home of the neighborhood head, Zhou Erguan, and reported the incident. Erguan ordered people to report to the township office, and the basic militia team arrested Pan and Changguan. The murderer Zhou A'nan is at large. On the afternoon of the 17th, they were taken to the court for examination. Wu had been slashed more than ten times all over his body and was barely clinging to life.

<p>Mr. Yang Xingfo lived alone, unmarried, at the International Publications Exchange Office of the National Academia Sinica, at 331 Avenue Albert, French Concession. His eldest son, Xiao Fo, is only fifteen years old and studies at the Datong University Middle School near the South Railway Station. He visited Mr. Yang regularly every week.

<p>Mr. Yang was a skilled equestrian who enjoyed riding on the Great Western Road and Zhongshan Road during his leisure time. He kept two famous horses in the stables on the Great Western Road and hired a groom to take care of them, spending a great deal of money each month. He had become accustomed to taking car rides and riding his horses on weekends and holidays. Yesterday morning, at 7 a.m., Mr. Yang got up and put on his riding clothes and a gray felt hat. At 8 a.m., he finished dressing and slowly walked out of the courtyard with his son Xiao Fo, intending to take a car to the stables on the Great Western Road to change to his famous horses and ride into the countryside.</p>
<h3 id="e93">Riding in a Convertible, Life and Death are Destined <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>The Academia Sinica has two cars for Mr. Yang to use, one a Dodge sedan and the other a 1929 Nash convertible, driven alternately by the chauffeurs Qiang Xiangsheng and Fusheng. Usually, Fusheng drove on Sundays. Yesterday morning, both cars were parked in the courtyard, the convertible in front and the sedan behind. Mr. Yang initially entered the sedan after descending the stairs, but because Fusheng was not there, he got out and got into the convertible driven by Qiang Xiangsheng. Fusheng was spared from disaster. Is it not true that life and death are destined?</p>
<h3 id="e94">Thugs Rushed Out, Bullets Rained Down <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>The father and son got into the convertible, and after they were seated, the chauffeur Qiang Xiangsheng started the engine. As the car was leaving the Academia Sinica gate, four thugs in short coats suddenly rushed out from the roadside, each wielding a box cannon, and fired at the car from both sides. Bullets rained down. The chauffeur Qiang Xiangsheng was hit twice in the chest, but his body was strong. Despite being injured, he immediately opened the car door, ran out, and jumped into another car to go to the Red Cross Hospital on Avenue Haig for treatment. In this moment of crisis, Mr. Yang, out of love for his son, leaned over Xiao Fo's body to protect him. At this time, two thugs continued to shoot at Mr. Yang from both sides of the car. Three bullets hit him in vital areas, and he fell in the car and died immediately. Xiao Fo was fortunate to have only been hit in the right leg and suffered minor injuries due to Mr. Yang's protection. The assassins, seeing that their objective had been achieved, fled in all directions.</p>

<p>The sound of gunfire alerted nearby neighbors, who came out to see what was happening and witnessed the assassins calmly escaping. No one dared to come forward to help. Mr. Beck, a Russian employee of the Li Han Automobile Company at No. 362 across from the Academia Sinica, ran downstairs and, braving the flying bullets, stepped forward to the door of Mr. Yang's car. He looked inside and saw Mr. Yang lying in a pool of blood in the car with his son under him. Mr. Beck then asked Mr. Yang what had happened, but Mr. Yang was too injured to answer, only groaning. His condition was extremely critical. Mr. Beck disregarded everything, closed the car door, and drove the car to the Guangci Hospital on Rue du Père Robert for treatment. Unfortunately, Mr. Yang died of his injuries at 9:20 a.m. and was taken to the morgue by the hospital.</p>
<h3 id="e96">Yang Hit Three Times, Deep Wounds in Chest and Side <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>Upon arriving at the Guangci Hospital, doctors Bojishi and Wu Can examined Mr. Yang and determined that he had died. They immediately washed and bandaged him and sent him to the hospital morgue. Mr. Yang's son, Xiao Fo, was wounded in the right thigh. The bullet only grazed him, and his injuries were not serious. He was immediately treated by Dr. Luo Zhong and sent to the ward. According to Dr. Wu Can, Mr. Yang was hit three times: one bullet entered the left side and exited through the right side, one bullet entered the left waist, and one bullet entered the chest above the tip of the heart. The bullet that killed Mr. Yang was this one. Later, when the reporter went to the morgue, he only saw Mr. Yang's body wrapped entirely in white cloth, lying quietly in the room. The scene was extremely tragic.</p>
<h3 id="e97">Xiao Fo Slightly Injured, Spirits Quite Good <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>Later, the reporter went to the ward to visit Mr. Yang's son, Xiao Fo. He said, "After coming to the hospital, Mr. Cai Yuanpei and Mr. Xu Kuanfu came to see me. My mother also came, but she doesn't know that my father is dead yet. Everyone is afraid that she will be sad." He also told the reporter that he has a younger brother at home who is only two years old, and that he himself is fifteen years old. Because his injuries are not serious, his spirits are still good. He told the reporter about the incident in a very organized manner. Wang Changshan and Xu Youyi from the French police Special Branch were in the room to protect him.</p>
<h3 id="e98">Chauffeur Xiang Da in Critical Condition <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>After chauffeur Qiang Da was sent to the Red Cross Hospital on Avenue Haig for emergency treatment, doctors confirmed that he had been shot twice, once below the ribcage and once in the waist. His injuries were extremely serious. Although doctors at the Red Cross Hospital performed surgery to try to save him, he was delirious and in very critical condition. Doctors said that if his fever did not rise tonight (last night) or tomorrow morning (this morning), his life might be saved.</p>

<p>The four assassins adopted a three-sided ambush strategy, so the box cannons were fired most intensely, and bullets flew everywhere. A stray bullet fired by an assassin on the left side of the car accidentally hit the right arm of an assassin on the right side. The assassin could not support himself after being injured and fled. At that time, Wang Youxiang, a Chinese policeman No. 104 at the traffic lights at the intersection of Avenue Albert and Rue Lafayette, heard the alarm and rushed to the scene. He blew his whistle and drew his gun to chase after the wounded assassin. However, because Avenue Albert was under construction and there were many laborers, he was hesitant to shoot. The assassin fled to a flat house at the intersection of Route des Soeurs and Rue Ningpo, and suspecting that there was no way out and fearing arrest, he committed suicide with a pistol to his left neck and fell to the ground injured. He was arrested and taken to Guangci Hospital for treatment.</p>

<p>After the assassin who committed suicide in desperation was sent to Guangci Hospital, he was treated and interrogated. He claimed his surname was Gao, his name was Dechen, and he was from Shaoxing. He was 32 years old and had only been in Shanghai for a week. He was visiting a friend on Avenue Seymour and passed by this place. He denied being the murderer of Yang, but his remaining words were evasive and he refused to reveal anything further. Later, because the aorta was injured, the doctors could not save him. He lost too much blood and died at 10 a.m. The assassin was wearing a gray short suit, a white shirt, white socks, and rubber sneakers. Blood was flowing from his neck. The items found on his body were kept by the police for investigation.</p>

<p>The meeting decided to ask lawyer Wu Kaisheng to represent the family to pursue legal action. Mr. Cai also telegraphed the National Government in his capacity as president to apprehend the murderer.

She has been treated for three weeks and has gradually recovered after surgery. However, she still needs to rest for a long time." Mr. Wang also said, "There is some discord between the central government and the southwest, which is an undeniable fact. However, the central government is determined not to start a civil war and hopes that the authorities of various provinces will work hard to build up their enterprises and seek unification through construction and abandon the illusion of unification by force. Chen Mingshu, who was previously overseas, telegraphed Beijing to express that he could stay in Guangdong, Fujian, or Beijing, but he did not want to assume any title or responsibility for the time being. There has been no correspondence recently. Hu Hanmin is still in Hong Kong and has complete freedom of action. Both Beijing and Guangdong have telegraphed to invite Mr. Hu. It is very normal for Guangdong to urge Mr. Hu to go to the province. There is no news of the southwest forming another government. The central government's foreign policy has not changed. There are no secret annexes to the North China Truce Agreement. From now on, we can only work hard to strengthen our own strength. There is still a part of the puppet army in Rehe Province, and we are currently discussing solutions. If there are no conditions attached, we will allow them to be incorporated." Mr. Wang finally said, "The rumor of the sale of the Chinese Eastern Railway is obviously a concession of the Soviet Union to Japan. If it becomes a reality, our country will resolutely deny it."</p>

<p>Among those who attended the ceremony yesterday were Minister of Transportation Zhu Jia骅, Director Wen Yuqing of the International Telecommunications Bureau and his wife, Director Wen Hong'en of the Municipal Public Security Bureau and his wife, Vice Chairman Ma Xier of the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Board of Trustees and his wife, Mr. Ligat of the British Marconi Wireless Telegraph Company, Mr. Xue Keling of the Radio Corporation of America, Mr. Fang Saike and Mr. Sha Wensheng of Siemens, Mr. Han Pusi of the French Public Works Bureau, and over a hundred other Chinese and foreign guests.

<p>Following the ceremony, Chairman Zhu Jia骅 gave a report, stating briefly: "Today, we are holding the foundation laying ceremony for the expansion of the International Radio Station to establish direct communication between Shanghai and London, building a new transmitter building.  I am very honored to have you all here to participate. I have two points to report regarding the International Radio Station: (1) Before the completion of the International Radio Station, overseas telegrams relied on wired telegraph for transmission and reception. Since the establishment of the International Radio Station, one-third of overseas telegrams can now be transmitted directly. This is partly because some people do not yet understand wireless communication, and partly because the station does not meet the needs of all parties, so wired telegraph is still used. However, the Ministry of Transportation has recently signed contracts with various wired telegraph companies, and has taken over the rights to transmit and receive telegrams. This matter was resolved after a year of negotiations. (2) The International Radio Station has already established communication with France, the United States, Germany, and other countries, but has not yet established direct communication with Britain, which is most important to our country's economy and commerce.  In order to realize this line, the Ministry of Transportation actively pursued the entire plan last spring, and through recent efforts, we are able to hold the foundation laying ceremony for the new radio station today. Communication between China and Britain should be realized in the shortest possible time. All the necessary machinery and materials were purchased with a loan of £50,000 from the Boxer Indemnity Fund. Other construction costs are being funded by the Ministry of Transportation.  The Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Board of Trustees has provided considerable assistance in this preparation for Sino-British communication."</p>
<h3 id="e123">Mr. Ma's Speech <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>Next, Vice Chairman Ma Xier of the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Board of Trustees gave a speech, stating briefly: "I am very honored to be here today to participate in this grand ceremony.  I would like to say a few words to you all.  The fact that the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Board of Trustees has loaned money to the Ministry of Transportation to prepare for Sino-British communication demonstrates the spirit of mutual assistance and cooperation between the two countries. Currently, telegrams sent from China to Britain must be relayed through Paris, France, and Berlin, Germany, which is quite troublesome. In the future, after direct communication between China and Britain is established, not only will commerce between China and Britain gradually develop, but also the feelings between the peoples of the two countries will become more friendly day by day.  These are my thoughts, and I believe that all of you present share these sentiments."</p>
<h3 id="e124">Construction of Iron Towers <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>The International Radio Station in Zhenru and Liuhang already has several antenna towers. Now, in order to expand, three more antenna towers are being built in Zhenru and five in Liuhang. These towers are 160 feet high and construction has already begun. It is expected that they will be completed by the end of August.</p>
<h3 id="e125">Foundation Laying Ceremony <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>After Mr. Ma's speech, everyone stood at attention, and Minister of Transportation Zhu Jia骅 unveiled the blue silk cloth covering the pre-fabricated foundation stone. The foundation stone is made of alum stone in a rectangular shape, with black characters engraved on it, reading: "In Memory of the Expansion of Zhenru Wireless Radio Station, May 1st, 22nd Year of the Republic of China. Zhu Jia骅 lays the stone."</p>
<h3 id="e126">Communication by the End of the Year <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>The radio station determined that the original radio station for Sino-British communication was not sufficient for the task, so a new building is being constructed next to the Zhenru Radio Station. The project was contracted to the Xinyingji Construction Company, and construction began in April. As of yesterday, the exterior of the building has been completed. According to the New News Agency reporter, who spoke for the radio station, the entire project will be completed by the end of July. As for the equipment ordered from Britain, except for the antenna tower equipment, which has already been shipped to Shanghai, the remaining two 20-kilowatt transmitters, attached communication equipment, and four large-scale radios (to be installed in Liuhang) have not yet arrived. It is expected that they will arrive in succession by mid-August. Installation is scheduled to begin in early September, and will be completed within ten days.  As to whether the sound is clear, it must be corrected for one or two months. Therefore, Sino-British communication will be possible at the earliest by the end of the year.</p>
<h3 id="e127">Tianchu Airplane Arrives in Shanghai <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>A Junkers fighter plane is scheduled to be imported and unloaded yesterday, according to the New News Agency.  The Tianchu MSG Factory of this city ordered the "Tianchu" airplane from the Curtiss Aeroplane and Motor Company of the United States. It arrived in Shanghai on the 16th and a naming ceremony will be held at the Hongqiao Airport on a scheduled date.</p>
<h3 id="e128">Airplane Specifications <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>The "Tianchu" airplane is a Junkers fighter plane ordered from the Curtiss Aeroplane and Motor Company in the United States. It can reach an altitude of over 30,000 feet. The fuselage is nimble and it flies freely, capable of flying several hundred miles per hour. Two machine guns can be placed in the front and rear of the fuselage, and several large and small bombs can be placed on the wings. Bombing and bombing runs can be performed according to the mechanisms. A telephone and indicator mechanism are placed in the middle, so that it can measure and predict everything in advance. It is truly the only sharp weapon for military use.</p>
<p>The plane, shipped from the United States, arrived in Shanghai on the 16th. Because the customs procedures have not yet been completed, it has not yet been imported. Later, the factory transferred it to the Aviation Association to find a way to complete it, and it has now been completed. Yesterday it could have been imported and unloaded, but because it was a Sunday, customs was closed, so the import and unloading will be tomorrow. The value of the plane is approximately 120,000 yuan. Because the parts inside the machine have not yet been fully equipped, the Curtiss company has not sent a list either, so the exact amount cannot yet be calculated. The earliest date for the plane's test flight will be two weeks later, after the parts have been fully equipped, and then a decision will be made. All driving talent will also be appointed by the Aviation Association to Chinese personnel to take charge. After the test flight, it will be handed over to the Central Aviation Administration to be incorporated into the aviation team.</p>
<h3 id="e129">Railway Employees Request a Raise; Railway Bureau to Respond Tomorrow <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Railways has issued an order for it to be announced, but the employees' attitude remains firm. The employees of the Jin-Hu and Hu-Hang-Yong railways have requested a raise for the year 22. After telegraphing the authorities to request a response within a time limit, the Railway Bureau dispatched Deputy Director of the General Affairs Department Yuan Boyang to go to Beijing to ask for instructions. He returned to Shanghai yesterday, and is scheduled to respond to the employees on the 20th. Details are recorded below:</p>
<h3 id="e130">Director Returns to Shanghai; Response Tomorrow <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>Bureau Chief Huang Boqiao, regarding the employees' request for a raise, said that the Ministry of Railways has regulations that only those who are diligent and have meritorious service can be promoted. Therefore, Deputy Director of the General Affairs Department Yuan Boyang was specially dispatched to Beijing to ask the Ministry of Railways for instructions. Mr. Yuan returned to Shanghai yesterday morning. It is said that because Minister of Railways Gu Mengyu was not in Beijing, Vice Minister Zeng Zhongming met with him on his behalf. Because this matter is of great importance, a universal raise would be inconsistent with the salary regulations for employees of state-owned railways, so it is necessary to wait for Minister Gu to return to Beijing to decide on a solution. It is now heard that the Minister returned to Beijing yesterday, but it happened to be a Sunday and the office was closed. As soon as he arrives at the Ministry today, a decision can be made, and tomorrow the Ministry will issue an order for it to be announced.</p>
<h3 id="e131">Employees Quietly Await Resolution <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>Currently, the representatives of the Jin-Hu Railway Traffic Department's employees' annual raise movement for the year 22 are all in Wuxi, and the representatives of the Hu-Hang Railway are concentrated in Jiaxing, all quietly awaiting the Railway Bureau's response. If the response is deemed unsatisfactory, they will first jointly petition the Bureau, and then take effective measures such as not selling tickets, not checking tickets, and not collecting tickets, in order to maintain railway traffic.</p>
<h3 id="e132">Traffic Department Director Advises Employees <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>Zheng Baozhao replied to the Jin-Hu Railway employees by telegram, saying: "To all section chiefs and station team members of the Jin-Hu Railway Traffic Department: Regarding the annual raise case, the Railway Bureau headquarters has exchanged correspondence for more than ten times over the past few months. It is heard that a solution has been agreed upon and will be announced soon. As for the saying that the raise will be canceled, it is completely groundless. Do not lightly believe rumors. It is hoped that you will understand the Bureau's difficulties. In this autumn of external aggression and internal troubles, my colleagues in the Traffic Department should continue to uphold the spirit of patriotism and love of the road, maintain national strength. This Director has always shared weal and woe with you. You all deeply know the great righteousness, which has always been commended. I hope that you will work in peace and work as usual. Unnecessary actions should be strictly prohibited. Zheng Baozhao, Traffic Department Director, respectfully printed."</p>

<p>The delegation telegraphed to colleagues at all stations yesterday, saying: "To the colleagues at all stations of this railway: This delegation decided at the fourth meeting that, because there has been no concrete response to the raise for the year 22, all night trains will be under the guidance of the Party Department and the Union to jointly petition in Beijing. I hope that all colleagues will work as usual, work in peace, and await a resolution. I urge you to pay attention to the activities of undesirable elements at any time.

<h3 id="e134">Taikoo Labor Strike Becomes More Serious; Foshan and Other Ships Continue to Go on Strike <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>The Central Cabin Public Office issued a declaration yesterday regarding the case of the British-owned Taikoo Company expelling Central Cabin workers. After the Guangzhou Seamen's Branch filed a complaint, the company ignored it, causing the Shandong ship to go on strike on the 15th. The Foshan, Taishan, Longshan, and Jinshan ships on the Guangzhou-Hong Kong route went on strike the day before yesterday. The situation is serious. The Union also issued a declaration yesterday. The situation is recorded below:</p>
<h3 id="e135">Successive Strikes <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>Since the Shandong ship on the Shanghai-Guangzhou route went on strike on the 15th, because the company still has no sincerity in accepting it, the Foshan, Taishan, Longshan, and Jinshan ships on the Guangzhou-Hong Kong route went on strike the day before yesterday (i.e., the 17th). They are currently anchored in Hong Kong. It is heard that the Xinjiang ship on the Shanghai-Guangzhou route arrived in Guangzhou yesterday, and the Taiyuan and Suiyang ships (yesterday's report that the Suiyang was also on strike was inaccurate) are scheduled to sail to Guangzhou on the 20th, and may also participate in the strike.</p>

<p>The Guangzhou Seamen's Branch telegraphed the Shanghai Seamen's Branch, saying: "To the Shanghai Seamen's Branch: After the Shandong ship went on strike, negotiations have still not been held. The Foshan, Taishan, and other four ships are all anchored in Hong Kong. Therefore, the Wusong ship case has been expanded. All ships on this route will be prohibited from sailing when they come to Guangzhou. I hope that you will quickly transfer to the Han co-workers and wait for a resolution. The emotions of the co-workers and various groups in the Guangdong area are indignant, and they vow to provide assistance. The Guangdong Seamen's Branch respectfully kowtows."</p>

<h3 id="e137">Details of Tang Jiapeng's Assassination <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>The stray bullet killed Wu Guangcai's wife's friend. Talk of premonitions, suspicions of rumors, and altercations with tea workers. Endured again and again. Yesterday morning at 1:05 AM, Tang Jiapeng, the manager of the Great World Amusement Park, was assassinated by an enemy and died. A stray bullet also killed a pedestrian. These details have already been recorded in this newspaper. It was not until noon yesterday that the passerby killed by the stray bullet was identified. Further details are recorded below:</p>
<h3 id="e138">Tang's Experience <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>Since the death of the great merchant Huang Chu Jiu in the tenth year of the Republic [1921], the Great World Amusement Park was taken over by Mr. Huang Jinrong, and Mr. Tang Jiapeng took over the position of manager. Since taking office, he has spared no effort in internal reorganization and planning. Therefore, Tang is truly a powerful force behind the success of the Great World today. In addition to holding this position, Tang is also a director of the Taohuagong Restaurant on Min Ti Ni Yin Road, opened a fish market on Xiaodongmen Avenue with sole proprietorship, and a shareholder of the Dahua Hotel on Xizang Road, as well as many other side businesses. He also once held an important position in the Jiangxi 49th Army stationed in Shanghai.</p>
<h3 id="e139">An Object Fell <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>Tang realized that the Great World was a heavy responsibility and a busy place, so he personally went there every night and did not return to his residence until after the night was over. He was accustomed to this routine every day. Around 9:00 PM the night before last, Tang took his own Austin car (Concession number 5415, City number 14160), driven by the chauffeur Xu Arong, to the Great World office as usual. Just as he took off his coat, his friends Sun Shaoqing, Wang Zhenchuan, Wu Weiyu, and Xia Chengzhang came to visit in succession, and gathered in the manager's office to chat. Unexpectedly, just as they were in the midst of a lively conversation, an object suddenly fell from the beam.</p>
<h3 id="e140">Debate on Fortune <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>The object was as big as a chicken egg, white and clean. It fell next to Tang's arm. Upon closer inspection, it was a white rat. Everyone was surprised and suspicious. At that time, the friends all thought that the rat had slipped and fallen to the ground, which was an ominous sign. Therefore, they all advised Mr. Tang to pay attention to everything. However, Mr. Tang did not care about such trivial matters, and said that he was born in the year of the ox, and a rat falling on an ox was actually a good omen. The friends also talked about other things and laughed, and before they knew it, it was already 12:00 AM.</p>

<p>At 12:50 AM, it was the scheduled time for the Great World to close. The corner of Edward Road was crowded with people. It was not until all the tourists in the venue had dispersed that it was 1:05 AM the next morning. Tang and his friends all put on their clothes and walked out in single file. Tang planned to go straight to the car that was parked in advance to get in. At that time, his friend Sun Shaoqing suddenly asked Tang, "Are you going tomorrow?" Tang replied, "Of course I am." Because he had to attend Mr. Huang Jinrong's banquet at Huang's Garden in Caohejing the next day. Unexpectedly, as soon as Tang finished speaking, gunshots suddenly rang out.</p>
<h3 id="e143">Fell to the Ground in Response <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>As soon as Tang came out of the Great World gate, the thugs had gathered around on all sides. When Tang and Sun got into the car separately, the thugs fired their guns at Tang. Tang fell to the ground next to the car in response, and blood flowed all over the place. The chauffeur Xu Arong witnessed his master being killed. At first, he tried to help Tang into the car, but when he saw the gunshots, he had to curl up next to the car. It was not until the thugs dispersed and fled that he helped Tang into the car and rushed him to Baolong Hospital, while notifying his family and reporting to the police.</p>
<h3 id="e144">Tang's Family <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>Tang's nickname is A Yu. He is a native of Ningbo, 45 years old, with one wife and one concubine. His family lives at No. 3, Wufuli, Luzon Road, Huaxiao Ge Road, French Concession. He left behind two sons and three daughters. The eldest daughter's name is Xiuzhu, the second is Xiuzhen, both 18 years old. The eldest son Yunlong is 11 years old, the second son Yunhu is only 3 years old, and the third daughter's name is Xiuying, 8 years old.</p>
<h3 id="e145">Five Bullets Took His Life <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>In this battle, the thugs fired a total of more than 30 shots. Tang was hit by five bullets all over his body, including the right flank, right chest, nose, and left leg. Most of them were in vital areas. Therefore, he died shortly after arriving at the hospital. The police, upon hearing the news, immediately notified their colleagues at the Fuyuan branch and ordered the attendants to carry the body into the coroner's office and report to the Second Special District Court for an autopsy. However, yesterday happened to be Sunday, so the examination must wait until 10:00 AM today. It is heard that after the examination is completed, the body will be taken to the Haige Road Chinese Funeral Home for burial.</p>

<p>According to the deceased's wife and relatives and friends who went to comfort her yesterday, on the night of the 15th of this month, the deceased returned to his residence after finishing his work. Suddenly, a person sat down on the sofa, his eyebrows tightly locked, as if he was thinking about something. A kind of depressed state was shown on his face. I (Tang's wife refers to herself) asked him why. According to the answer, he had an altercation with a tea worker in a certain department of the Great World this evening. The tea worker even made rude remarks and was unreasonable, etc. When he spoke, he showed a very negative attitude. I then comforted him and instructed him to resign from his position at the Great World within the possible scope, so as to recuperate. At that time, the deceased continued to say that he had to go to Nanjing. I went to Guandi Temple on Fuxu Road the next day to ask for a spiritual divination for him, asking if he could go. Unexpectedly, the interpretation of the verses on the divination slip actually urged him to go as soon as possible, so as to avoid misfortune. I quickly told him the truth, but the deceased suddenly forgot about it. I did not urge him either. Unexpectedly, in less than three days, he suffered this tragedy. Could it be that there was a fixed number in the dark? As she spoke, tears streamed down her face, and the situation was extremely tragic.</p>
<h3 id="e147">The Stray Bullet Victim <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>When Mr. Tang was shot, the bullets flew around. A man, about 20 years old, wearing a white short shirt, black trousers, was hit in the head by stray bullets in two places and died immediately. At that time, his surname could not be investigated. It was not until yesterday noon that a rattan shop worker recognized him. The deceased's name was Wu Guangcai, 31 years old, from Jiangdu. He is now a tea room in the Juquan Bathhouse on Nan Chu Jiaqiao. He immediately notified the bathhouse, and then the deceased's nephew Wu Chaoxing rushed to the coroner's office to identify him without error. He urgently made a long-distance call to Suzhou to summon the deceased's wife to Shanghai to handle the funeral.</p>

<p>The victimized passengers accused the crew. The Ministry of Transportation ordered the Shipping Bureau to thoroughly investigate and reply. The Ningshao Company's Yongxing ship ran aground and sank on Mopan Mountain in the Zhejiang-Fujian sea area. The crew and passengers were also kidnapped by pirates. This matter was recorded in this newspaper early on. The people who were kidnapped by the pirates were all redeemed by the day before yesterday. Ship accountant Zhu Shisheng returned to Shanghai from the pirate den and reported on the suppression of bandits and salvage of ships in great detail. It is urgently recorded as follows:</p>

<p>Most of the pirates who robbed the Yongxing ship were fishermen and local ruffians from the Mopan Mountain area near Haimen. Therefore, after robbing the ship, they also kidnapped the crew and passengers to extort ransoms. The amount was not very large, but after paying 400 or 500 gold, the bandits would release the hostages. In the end, three passengers and ship accountant Zhu Shisheng, a total of four people, were delayed in being released because the ransom was not received. Zhu was released for 600 yuan, and the remaining three also paid 500 gold each. Therefore, all those who were kidnapped have been released.</p>

<p>Mr. Zhu returned to Shanghai after being released from the Mopan Mountain bandit den. He first went to Haimen and then returned to Shanghai. According to Mr. Zhu, when he escaped from the bandit den, it was just when the Fujian army and the navy joined forces to advance into the Mopan Mountain bandit area. The bandits also resisted. When Zhu and others left the bandit's nest, the officers and soldiers were aggressively pursuing and suppressing them. At that time, the situation was very dangerous. Zhu and others were able to escape safely and return, which was also fortunate. At the moment, the bandits have been surrounded by officers and soldiers, and it is expected that they will be wiped out soon.</p>
<h3 id="e151">All Goods Unloaded <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>After the Yongxing sank, except for the valuables that had been robbed by the pirates, the rest of the goods were submerged in the sea with the ship. Later, the China Salvage Company sent a ship to try to unload all the goods in the ship. To date, they have been transported to Haimen in batches. Among them, most of the goods, such as paper, were useless after being submerged in water, but a large number of wood can still be used. The salvaged water-stained goods have been kept by the insurance companies that underwrote the marine insurance. In the future, after they are sold, the funds will be fairly divided.</p>
<h3 id="e152">Hull Lifted <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>The hull of the Yongxing was jointly entrusted by Ningshao and various insurance companies to the China Salvage Company for salvage. The work has been going on for a long time, and it is now heard that the ship is expected to be salvaged. The workers working on the ship are currently entering the water to repair the holes in the bottom of the ship, and then pumping out the accumulated water to lift the hull. Near the sunken ship, the Navy Department has sent the Cheng Sheng warship to protect the workers salvaging the ship.</p>
<h3 id="e153">Ministry of Transportation Thoroughly Investigates <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>The victimized passengers on the Yongxing ship have now jointly submitted a report to the Ministry of Transportation accusing the Yongxing ship's crew of neglecting their duties and making light of the lives of the people, causing the passengers to suffer major losses from robbery and kidnapping. They also said that the Yongxing accident was not an irresistible maritime disaster, but its cause was the crew's wrong route, and the pirates' robbery was after the ship ran aground. It is different from an irresistible maritime disaster. The company should be responsible for compensating for the losses. The Ministry of Transportation has sent this report to the Shanghai Maritime Administration for thorough investigation and verification.</p>
<h3 id="e154">A Floating Corpse on the Sea Urgently Awaits Identification <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>Hands and feet were tied, with a huge stone tied to the waist. The corpse was rotten and difficult to identify. It is not known whether it was a victimized peddler of Xin Renhe. The tragic case that occurred on the Xin Renhe ship has been concluded by the Shanghai Local Court Prosecutor's Office, and a public prosecution has been filed, awaiting sentencing. The day before yesterday, Jiang Yiping and Gu Hanli, the lawyers representing the families of the victims, suddenly received a letter from a citizen of Baoshan County, reporting that the Bureau's sea surface had found a floating corpse. According to the report, the male corpse that had floated up was about 30 years old, but it was slightly rotten. The corpse was tall, wearing a white twill blue striped cotton jacket, black twill cotton vest, white twill bottom blue broad striped short shirt, white twill bottom blue striped padded pants, floral line wool car pants, black woolen socks, and black cloth-faced cloth-soled shoes. The corpse's head was wrapped in a sack, with the words "Qinglian Color, Company X" printed on the bag. Both hands and feet were tied with lead wire and hemp rope, and both hands were tied behind the back. A huge stone was tied around the waist. The corpse had the words "Never Separate" printed in blue on the left arm, and there were also patterns printed on the right arm, but they were rotten and difficult to identify. The report also contained speculation, and after Jiang and Gu received the letter, in order to be serious, in addition to reporting the original letter to the court, Gu immediately summoned the families of the victims and inquired in detail. The families could not confirm that the corpse that was found was the victim himself. They proposed to go to identify it first, and unanimously requested the lawyers representing them to prepare a letter for them, so that they could go to Baoshan County in person. At the same time, Ma Chen and Mei You were elected by the families present as representatives to go to Baoshan to identify the corpse.</p>
<h3 id="e155">Chen Qingmei Commits Suicide Under Economic Pressure <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>The date of the house relocation is getting closer and closer. Chen Qingmei, 45, a native of Zhongzha, Liuhang Town, Baoshan County, who opened a teahouse, died by cutting off his esophagus with scissors. He has a wife, Zhang, and children and partners, totaling more than ten people. The house where Chen opened the teahouse was originally rented from the Jin family. Recently, the Jin family has sold the house to the wife of Qian Xinyuan in the town. Now Qian's wife wants to renovate the house and has repeatedly urged Chen to move out. Chen has not been able to find a suitable house, so he has delayed until now. Moreover, his wife Zhang has six sons and two daughters. The eldest son is only 20 years old, and the youngest is still in her arms. Once he closes down, his livelihood will be cut off, and a family of more than ten people will have no way to survive. And the owner's side has been pressing him to move out, so he has the idea of committing suicide. A few days ago, Chen said to Zhang, "If you move, I have no way to maintain a livelihood, or I will die in this house," etc. Zhang did not take it seriously. Unexpectedly, at about 10:00 AM yesterday, Chen took advantage of the lack of preparation and cut his own neck with a paper cutter. Although he bled continuously, his throat was not broken, so he would not die. Because of the extreme pain, he had no choice but to cut off his esophagus with scissors and die. When the family noticed, he had already died and collapsed in a pool of blood. The cries of the whole family shook the sky, and those who heard it were saddened. According to the townspeople there, the deceased was a very honest person and was very loyal to others in doing things. Even when the house he lived in was sold to the Qian family, he was one of the intermediaries.</p>
<h3 id="e156">Zhang Fugeng's Marriage Turns Sour on the Eve of the Wedding <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>On the Third Day of Awaiting the Bride, No Redress Can Be Sought for Alleged Financial Deception; The First Instance Investigation Is Underway</p>
<p>Zhang Yuting, a farmer residing at No. 848, near the Shen Clan Ancestral Hall, north of the Xiaomuziqiao (Small Wooden Bridge) on Longhua Road, has a second son, Zhang Fugeng, now twenty-three years old. Due to the family's modest circumstances, local farming daughters are unwilling to marry him. However, as his son is of marrying age, there is an urgent need to find a spouse, so he sought a partner from another village to fulfill his wish.</p>
<p>In early January of this year, Sun Xiangsheng, a newly acquainted person, introduced Ruan Fuyuan from Qibao, acting as a matchmaker. Ruan claimed that his relative, Ruan Yousheng, also lived south of the Qibao Bridge, was wealthy, and had a daughter named A'mei, aged nineteen, of marriageable age and suitable for a match. Furthermore, A'mei was well-versed in domestic virtues, frugal, and unostentatious, making for a perfect union.</p>
<p>Zhang was overjoyed upon hearing this and immediately discussed the crucial matters of betrothal gifts, gold, and silver. The asking price was exorbitant, but after repeated negotiations, they agreed on a bride price of 400 silver dollars, a pair of gold bracelets, a gold ring, a pair of gold earrings, a watch, and silver ornaments, totaling nearly a thousand dollars. Considering the bride and groom were of age, they agreed to proceed without delay.</p>
<p>Therefore, Zhang managed to gather the required amount and sent it all over, setting February 10th as the wedding date. However, as Qibao was fifty to sixty miles from Xiaomuziqiao, making travel inconvenient, they agreed that the bride's family would send her to the groom's home the day before, and the wedding ceremony would be held the following day. Both parties agreed.</p>
<p>As the day approached, Zhang Yuting decorated his house with lanterns and colored streamers, slaughtered livestock, prepared wine, and invited all his relatives and friends, arranging twenty to thirty tables for the banquet. The atmosphere was joyful and lively. Unexpectedly, after waiting for the bride for three days, until the auspicious date had passed, the bridal sedan chair never arrived, and the marriage fell through at the last minute. A comedy of errors, resulting in a loss of both money and bride, became a laughingstock overnight.</p>
<p>Zhang was extremely resentful and questioned the matchmaker, but as the bride's family lived far away in Qibao, they were evasive and avoided meeting him. Later, it was discovered that the bride had disappeared three days before the wedding. The bride's father, Ruan Yousheng, also dared not appear. After repeated questioning of the matchmaker, no progress was made.</p>
<p>Since the marriage could not be finalized, and the bride price was not returned, Zhang and his son filed a lawsuit in the local court, accusing them of setting up a sham marriage and conspiring to defraud them of the bride price, requesting their arrest and investigation. The case is currently under investigation.</p>

<h3 id="e161">Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau Cracks Down on "Flower Lottery" Operations with Full Force <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>Wen Hong'en, the Director of the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau, has recently been concerned about the rampant flower lottery operations in the Chinese-controlled areas. Their situation has set a new record since the existence of flower lottery gambling. Even in remote rural areas, they have their own receiving stations, and the boats ply every alley and lane.</p>
<p>To understand the actual situation of its harm to society, and the number of locations, the bureau secretly dispatched police brigades and the supervisory office to investigate. It also allowed private individuals to report by letter.</p>
<p>The investigation revealed that within the relatively well-monitored areas of the city, the old Chinese city, the southern district, and the near southwestern area, there were as many as seventy-two large and small receiving stations. The information about the principal offenders and locations was reportedly quite detailed.</p>
<p>Secondly, in the relatively remote areas of Zhabei, the northwest, Wusong, Jiangwan, and Hongkou, the number of receiving stations was even greater, estimated at over a hundred, due to their geographical advantages and vastness. However, due to the smaller population and weaker financial resources after some warfare, although there were a few large-scale operations, they were not as impressive as those in the city center and southern district.</p>
<p>Furthermore, each receiving station had to hire at least thirty boats, and each boat had to collect at least forty to fifty thousand cash to cover their expenses. Gamblers were charged a 10% commission on their bets, and the boats paid 20% or 18% to the receiving station, from which they made their living.</p>
<p>The receiving stations, after collecting the money, divided it into balanced amounts using graph paper. The remaining amount was used to settle the wins and losses, which could amount to several thousand dollars a day. If the bets on certain numbers were excessive, they would transfer those bets to a larger operation to ensure a steady profit and avoid risk.</p>
<p>Such a huge drain has affected nearly 90% of the population in the city, with only a small percentage remaining unaffected. The harm to the area is substantial.</p>
<p>It is also rumored that larger operations are operating in the Chinese areas, but without fixed locations. The police brigade has been ordered to strictly investigate and arrest these operations based on the identified locations, and to punish them according to the law. As a result, several receiving stations have been raided daily in the southern district of Shanghai. However, they have become aware of the situation and have been temporarily relocating to avoid capture. Nevertheless, the Director has instructed his subordinates to remain vigilant and arrest them at any time. If any large operations are discovered within any district, the responsible officials will be held accountable.</p>
<h3 id="e162">The Situation of the Shanghai National Products Company Issuing Advantageous Coupons <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai National Products Company, located opposite the Hongmiao Temple on Nanjing Road, is expanding its Nanjing Road storefront and planning to rebuild its facade in an effort to develop its business. The expanded section has been open for business since the 17th of this month.</p>
<p>During this period, the company is issuing 1,000 advantageous coupons daily to thank ladies from all walks of life who patronize national products. Anyone who purchases goods worth two silver dollars or more can purchase an advantageous coupon for one dollar. The coupon can be used to draw goods, and the value of the goods drawn is always more than one dollar. The most valuable goods are Huasheng electric fans priced at 38 dollars and Ya'pu'er electric fans priced at 36 dollars.</p>
<p>The electric fan on the 17th was won by Mr. Yang Daye of No. 1267 Siwen Lane, Xinzha Road. The electric fan on the 18th was won by Mr. Miao Yizhong, the Chief Inspector of the Second District of the Zhejiang Inland River Police stationed in Shanghai, of No. 8 De Bao Lane, Jinling Road, Zhabei. Others who purchased bolts of raw silk fabrics worth over 20 dollars for the price of one dollar were also beaming with joy. As a result, the business is crowded and prosperous.</p>

<p>The Hengxiang Sock Factory, located at No. 135 Wuhua Road, Xiangyan Bridge, Hujia Wood Bridge, Zhabei, caught fire suddenly on the third floor of the factory at around 7:00 AM yesterday. As the factory employees were still asleep, they did not notice it at the time. When the fire spread to the second floor and the adjacent Tongren Foreign Goods Store, everyone woke up in alarm and fled outside, quickly reporting to the police station and notifying the fire brigades to rush to the scene and extinguish the fire. It took about half an hour to put out the fire. The factory owner was summoned by the police station in charge to inquire about the cause of the fire and investigate the matter.</p>

<p>Court Orders Repayment</p>
<p>Ms. Xue Jinyuan, known as a socialite, previously purchased a car from the Madi Automobile Company. She paid a certain amount of the price at the time, but still owed 1,800 to 1,900 dollars, with an agreed payment schedule. However, she failed to repay the debt. The automobile company sued Xue in the First Special District Court. After repeated court hearings, the court concluded that the defendant's debt was well-founded. Yesterday, Judge Qiao Wanxuan ordered the defendant to repay the full amount.</p>
<h3 id="e165">Fishmonger Kicks Female Customer, Causing Injury <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>Sentenced to Three Months in Prison and Ordered to Pay Medical Expenses</p>
<p>Liu Genfa, a 23-year-old man from Ningbo, runs a fish stall in the Tongzhou Road market. On the morning of the 8th of this month, at 10:30 AM, he had a dispute with Ms. Yan Jiang, a local woman residing at No. 2594 Deyu Lane, Dongyouheng Road, over the purchase of dark sleeper fish. He kicked her lower body, causing her to fall to the ground. Her uterus bled profusely.</p>
<p>Chinese Constable No. 3406 heard the alarm and arrested Liu, taking him to the Jiaxing Road police station for detention. Ms. Yan was taken to Guangren Hospital for treatment. The next morning, Liu was sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court for interrogation.</p>
<p>Attorney Zhang Tianyin, representing the police station, stated that the victim, Ms. Yan Jiang, had identified the defendant. According to the doctor, although she has recovered, it is difficult to determine whether the injury will recur and worsen in the future. Ms. Yan stated that she complained about the high price of the fish, leading to a verbal argument. Without asking the reason, he slapped her. When she intended to call a policeman to reason with him, he chased after her and kicked her lower body, causing her to fall unconscious. She had recently given birth and had not yet completed her confinement period, resulting in significant bleeding from the injury to her uterus. She hired a lawyer to demand 233.50 dollars in compensation for medical expenses and other losses for the private prosecution.</p>
<p>The defendant admitted to kicking her anus once out of anger because the plaintiff took two dark sleeper fish while he was distracted, but denied the rest. He also hired a lawyer to defend him. Judge Xiao He sentenced Liu Genfa to three months in prison. The number of days in detention before the sentence is finalized will be counted as one day of imprisonment for every two days of detention. He was also ordered to pay the plaintiff 39.50 dollars in medical expenses and other fees. The plaintiff's other claims were rejected.</p>

<p>After Investigation, Sentenced to Three Years in Prison</p>
<p>Ke Qingshan, an abductor from Hubei, abducted Shuangxi, a three-year-old child of his fellow villager Liu Zhenghong, from the entrance of a large alley on Yangzhou Road at around 3:00 PM the day before yesterday. He took the child to No. 64 Songpan Road and tried to sell him to Wang Jinbing from Ningbo. He falsely claimed that his wife had died suddenly from illness. His family was poor and lacked money for a coffin and burial, so he had to sell his son out of desperation at a low price.</p>
<p>Wang Jinbing's young grandson was abducted last June and has been missing ever since. He questioned Ke sternly and saw through his lies. Just as he was about to report him to the police, a crowd gathered. Constable No. 3132 from the Yangshupu police station passed by. Wang pointed out Ke as the abductor. The constable arrested him and took him and the child Shuangxi to the police station for detention.</p>
<p>At around 7:00 PM, the child's mother, Liu Qiushi, reported to the police station. They asked her to identify Shuangxi. She confirmed that he was her son Shuangxi. The child cried and called for his mother. The police chief handed the child back to her. The next morning, Ke Qingshan was sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Attorney Zhang Tianyin, representing the police station, detailed the situation. Liu Zhenghong, the child's father, and Wang Jinbing, a witness, testified about the events. The defendant's testimony was evasive. Judge Wu Zehan sentenced Ke Qingshan to three years in prison as a warning.</p>

<p>Sun Baoshun, a 58-year-old factory owner from Wuxi of the Central Iron Factory, No. 263 Kulun Road, Zhabei, filed a complaint with the Fourth District Public Security Bureau yesterday, stating that his daughter-in-law, Wang, also known as Cuidi, a 19-year-old woman from Hubei with nearsightedness, ran away on the evening of the 8th of this month while everyone was asleep, taking away silk fabrics, single, lined, cotton, and leather clothing. He had been searching for her for days without success and requested an investigation.</p>

<h3 id="e170">China National Aviation Corporation Orders New Aircraft <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>Shanghai-Guangdong Route to Open Before July 8; Chengdu Aircraft Repair Facility; Chongqing-Chengdu Section Temporarily Suspended</p>
<p>A reporter from the Aviation News Agency visited Mr. Li Diezhuang, secretary of the China National Aviation Corporation, yesterday and inquired about the company's recent business developments. Mr. Li provided detailed information, which is summarized below:</p>
<h3 id="e171">Ordering New Aircraft <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Li stated that the Shanghai-Chengdu route is currently the best-performing route for the company. However, the aircraft used on this route have been in service for several years and urgently need to be taken down for major repairs. To facilitate communication and travel for all parties, the company recently ordered three of the latest twin-engine commercial aircraft from the United States. Each aircraft has ten seats and can travel at 200 kilometers per hour. The journey between Shanghai and Wuhan will take a maximum of five hours. If departing from Shanghai at 8:00 AM, it will arrive in Wuhan no later than 1:00 PM. The journey from Wuhan to Chengdu will also take only six to seven hours. The aircraft are expected to be shipped to Shanghai in August, and two will be used for round-trip service between Shanghai and Wuhan, while one will be used for service between Wuhan and Chengdu.</p>
<h3 id="e172">Shanghai-Guangdong Route to Open <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>The four stations of the Shanghai-Guangdong route, including Guangzhou, Hong Kong, Shantou, and Xiamen, have been arranged and are ready. However, the originally planned land airfield in Guangzhou was deemed unsuitable and has been replaced with a water airfield at the Pearl River Bridge. Mr. Nie Kaiyi, the head of the aircraft navigation team, will return to Shanghai from Wenzhou within the next few days to report to the company on the arrangement of the station. He will then proceed to Fuzhou to complete the arrangement of all stations on the route. A test flight is scheduled around the 25th of this month, and the route will open no later than July 8. The board of directors had previously resolved that the route must open no later than this date. Initially, there will be three round trips per week, but if business is prosperous, it will be changed to daily round trips.</p>
<h3 id="e173">Chongqing-Chengdu Section Temporarily Suspended <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Li also stated that the Chongqing-Chengdu section opened on June 1 and performed well. However, due to the small size of the original airfield in Chengdu, making takeoffs and landings inconvenient, a new airfield is being built for safety reasons. It is being expedited by Chairman Liu and Mayor Wu of Chengdu with the help of engineers and is expected to reopen on July 1.</p>

<p>Mr. Li concluded that as the company's business is gradually developing and the number of aircraft is increasing, the Longhua airfield is no longer sufficient and urgently needs to be expanded. The Ministry of Communications previously sent surveyors to Shanghai to conduct surveys, but the surrounding landowners were asking exorbitant prices, making it impossible to purchase the land.

<h3 id="e175">Customs Administration Replies to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce Regarding the Ban on Private Ships Transporting Rapeseed <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>Due to Inconvenience for Customs Administration</p>
<p>The Customs Administration of the Ministry of Finance replied to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday:</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce requested that the customs offices of Suzhou, Hangzhou, and Jiaxing be instructed to continue allowing rapeseed to be transported by private ships. The Directorate General of Customs was instructed to investigate and reply.</p>
<p>The Directorate General of Customs reported that the transport of rapeseed produced in Suzhou, Hangzhou, and Jiaxing to Shanghai by private ships was previously handled in accordance with the "Trial Regulations for Trade between 'Jianghai' Customs and Chinese Steamers and Registered Chinese Merchant Private Ships traveling between Suzhou, Hangzhou, and Shanghai" and the "Trial Regulations for Trade between 'Jianghai' Customs and Foreign Steamers and Foreign Merchants Employing Private Ships or Self-Made Vessels traveling between Suzhou, Hangzhou, and Shanghai." The purpose was to facilitate merchants due to the *lijin* tax.</p>
<p>Since the abolition of the *lijin* tax, all domestic goods transported by sailing vessels have been exempted from tax, so it was inappropriate to levy customs duties only on those traveling between Suzhou, Hangzhou, and Shanghai. The Directorate General of Customs reported to the Ministry and obtained Order No. 8546 on December of last year, approving the repeal of the two regulations.</p>
<p>Since then, the customs offices of Suzhou, Hangzhou, and Shanghai have exempted sailboats transporting domestic goods from transit taxes. Domestic goods transported from Suzhou and Hangzhou to Shanghai for export will be declared and pay export taxes when they are transferred to ships in Shanghai, in accordance with the purpose of abolishing the *lijin* tax and the general practice of customs.</p>
<p>The current request from the merchants to declare and pay taxes on rapeseed transported from Suzhou, Hangzhou, and Jiaxing to Shanghai for export at the port of departure is inconsistent with the principle that domestic trade private ships are not under the management of customs. Furthermore, all kinds of private ships between Suzhou, Hangzhou, and Shanghai are not under the management of customs, so it is not appropriate to single out ships transporting rapeseed.</p>
<p>If the request to pay taxes at the Suzhou and Hangzhou customs offices is approved, the customs must take strict measures to manage the goods from the date of declaration to the date they are transported to Shanghai for export, to prevent any fraud. This would significantly increase the workload of the customs. Furthermore, the Jianghai Customs finds it extremely difficult to manage domestic goods transported by private ships for re-export, which is many times more difficult than managing export goods and ordinary re-exported goods transported by ships.</p>
<p>The merchants' request may be because the prices assessed by the Suzhou and Hangzhou customs offices for export goods are lower than those assessed by the Jianghai Customs, and they may be trying to avoid higher taxes. If the request is approved, there is a risk of fraud, tax revenue loss, and inconsistency with the general practice of customs.</p>
<p>The Directorate General of Customs recommends that the request be rejected. After verification, the statements made by the Directorate General of Customs are true. The previous request from the Chamber of Commerce is difficult to approve. You are hereby ordered to take note. Seal of the Customs Administration of the Ministry of Finance.</p>
<h3 id="e176">Weihaiwei Requests National Product Factories to Send Exhibits <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>To Organize a National Products Exhibition</p>
<p>The Shanghai National Products Factories Joint Association received a letter from the Weihaiwei Management Office stating that since the Office took over Weihaiwei, it has been vigorously promoting national products, but the sources are limited, and development is still slow. It is now summer, and the number of Chinese and foreign merchants coming to Weihaiwei for summer vacation has increased dramatically compared to previous years due to the impact of the war in Beidaihe and other places. Furthermore, there are often dozens of British and American warships stationed in Weihaiwei during the summer, with monthly salaries of millions of dollars. When the soldiers come ashore, the limited supply of national products is insufficient to meet their demand, which is a pity.</p>
<p>Therefore, it has joined forces with local organizations to form the Weihaiwei National Products Exhibition Preparatory Committee, responsible for collecting exhibits and organizing sales events. The exhibition is scheduled to run for two weeks starting on August 1 to promote national products. The exhibition will be held at three locations in the city: the Women's Middle School, Qingquan Elementary School, and the City God Temple. The city gates have been removed, and new, wide roads have been built, making transportation very convenient.</p>
<p>In addition to agreeing to cooperate with the Shanghai Citizens' National Products Promotion Association, it has been known that your association has spared no effort in promoting national products. Therefore, please provide assistance by instructing the relevant manufacturers to prepare exhibits and goods for sale immediately and transport them to Weihaiwei in advance to jointly promote the event.</p>
<h3 id="e177">Two National Product Organizations Collect Exhibits for Exhibition in Qingdao <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>Seven Methods Agreed Upon</p>
<p>The Shanghai Citizens' National Products Promotion Association and the China National Products Maintenance Association have been entrusted by the Qingdao Municipal Government to collect well-known national products from all provinces in Shanghai and various machines suitable for rural needs, and to lead national product factories to participate in the Qingdao Municipal Fourth National Products Exhibition, lasting for one month.</p>
<p>The associations believe that this National Exhibition will attract attention from people in various provinces of North China during the North China Games. There should be a large-scale organization to concentrate the power of national products to save the country. They have begun preparations and are actively collecting exhibits. The two organizations have held a joint meeting and agreed on the following methods:</p>
<p>(1) Notify all factory members and send letters to well-known factories and manufacturers of well-known local products in various provinces, as well as manufacturers of water conservancy, fire protection, agricultural machinery, and hygiene equipment, encouraging them to participate enthusiastically.</p>
<p>(2) The opening ceremony is scheduled for July 10, with loading on the 2nd and 3rd and departure on the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Putuo ship on the 4th.</p>
<p>(3) The venue is the Donglai Building at the intersection of Henan Road and Tianjin Road, with the exhibition hall on the first floor and the commercial areas on the second, third, and fourth floors, providing space for 200 to 250 booths.</p>
<p>(4) In addition to silk fabrics, cotton fabrics, knitwear, cosmetics, straw hats, leather goods, and rubber products, which are limited to six companies each, the remaining industries are limited to four companies each.</p>
<p>(5) The registration period for participating factories is from now until the 24th, and registration will be closed once the quota is full.</p>
<p>(6) Participating factories must submit a registration form, and only those who pass the review will be allowed to participate.</p>
<p>(7) Participating factories are prohibited from exhibiting products not manufactured by their own factories.</p>
<h3 id="e178">Explanation from the Fishery Improvement Committee of the Ministry of Industry for the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Region <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the Collection of Fishery Construction Fees</p>
<p>Since the Fishery Construction Fee Collection Office of the Fishery Improvement Committee of the Ministry of Industry for the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Region began collecting fees, fish merchants in Shanghai, Ningbo, and other places have opposed the collection, and the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Fisheries Federation has issued a declaration. A spokesperson for the committee issued the following statement to explain the situation:</p>
<h3 id="e179">Reasons for Establishment of the Committee <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>The central government established the committee due to the following reasons:</p>
<p>(1) The decline of traditional fisheries.</p>
<p>(2) The rise of coastal bandits, with fishermen and fish merchants often attacked.</p>
<p>(3) Foreign fishing vessels frequently fishing in China's coastal areas.</p>
<p>(4) A certain country has a strategy and detailed plan to occupy the center of Shanghai's aquatic industry.</p>
<p>(5) To prevent conflicts and disputes between the central and local fisheries authorities.</p>
<p>(6) To promote cooperation between the government and the industry.</p>
<p>(7) To seek the connection of businesses engaged in fishing, aquaculture, ice preservation, cold storage, salted goods, and other aquatic industries, and to jointly promote the consolidation and improvement of fisheries in the Jiangsu-Zhejiang region.</p>
<p>Therefore, the National Government issued Order No. 75, which stated that the 331st and 336th meetings of the Central Political Council discussed the fishery issue. The Review Committee, together with representatives from the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shanghai provincial and municipal governments, discussed and approved the following:</p>
<p>(1) A fishery construction fee of 2% of the value will be collected by fish merchants and remitted.</p>
<p>(2) The Ministry of Industry will establish the Fishery Improvement Committee for the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Region, with the Minister of Industry serving concurrently as the chairman. The committee's functions are the custody, allocation, audit of funds, and other matters related to the improvement of fisheries. The Ministry of Industry will draft the organizational regulations of the Fishery Improvement Committee for the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Region and submit them to the Executive Yuan for submission to the National Government for record. On February 15 of this year, Minister Chen arrived in Shanghai, convened directors of relevant departments, experts, members, and representatives elected by the approved fisheries associations and other organizations, and legally established the committee.</p>
<h3 id="e180">Determination of Tax Relief <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>The Central Political Conference values fisheries administration and believes that developing fisheries, in addition to exploiting freshwater and saltwater resources, can eliminate piracy and serve as an auxiliary to national defense. Therefore, it has specifically determined the method of collecting fishery construction fees, and the principle of "taking from fisheries and using for fisheries," imitating educational funding and special funds for agriculture, sericulture, and other sectors in Jiangsu Province. This is to improve fisheries and ensure they have special funds and maintain management independence. At the same time, it is stipulated that fish merchants will collect the fees on behalf of the government, to reduce disputes and harassment during collection, expressing sincerity and cooperation with the fishing industry. Moreover, the term "fisheries" in our country actually includes industries such as the harvesting, aquaculture, manufacturing, transportation, marketing, and storage of aquatic products, which is the same as the term "aquatic industry" in Japan. This is evidenced by regulations regarding the administrative and organizational scope of the Fisheries and Animal Husbandry Department of the Ministry of Industries and the fishery associations in various cities and counties. The so-called "taking from fisheries and using for fisheries" does not narrowly mean taking from fishermen and using for fishermen, but broadly means taking from the fisheries industry and using for the fisheries industry.</p>
<h3 id="e181">Explanation of Fees <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>In March of the year before last, in order to prevent the dumping of foreign fishing catches and promote domestic fisheries, the National Government promulgated an order to exempt domestic fish taxes and fishing taxes. However, Article 35 of the Fisheries Law, regarding the collection of taxes on catches, was preserved as is in the article on collecting taxes on catches in the revised Fisheries Law promulgated by the Legislative Yuan last year. Now, the government has not collected the 5% additional tax but is first raising fishery construction fees, which truly demonstrates the government's good intentions in protecting the fishery industry.</p>
<h3 id="e182">Explanation of Collection on Behalf <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>The situation of the fisheries industry in the Jiangsu and Zhejiang region varies from place to place. However, fish merchants are all engaged in selling aquatic products, earning commissions or profits. For example, since the era of the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Fishery Association in the sixth year of the Republic [1917], Shanghai fish merchants have handled matters such as customs duties, fishing taxes, ocean protection fees, customs declaration fees, and Jiangsu-Zhejiang Fishery Association business fees for ice-fresh vessels, collecting as much as sixty or seventy yuan per vessel each time. This amount was deducted by the fish merchants from the payments to the fish traders after the goods were sold. In the past, Shanghai fish merchants had many types and amounts of fees, such as commissions, public contributions, customs declaration fees, and fees for various public security guilds. However, they have uniquely expressed opposition to the collection of construction fees, and their reasons are not sufficient, which easily arouses suspicion. For example, the customs duties paid on salted and dried goods are lower than those of any other country. In order to comprehensively reorganize and develop the fishery industry, it is also necessary to add a small amount of fishery construction fees. Furthermore, fishermen entrust fish merchants to sell the aquatic products they harvest and receive cash. Fish merchants rely on the aquatic products obtained by fishermen, and after selling them, they earn commissions or profits. The rise and fall of market prices and the receipt and disbursement of funds are all centered around the fish merchants in the operation of the fishery industry, and fishermen and fish merchants cannot be separated and must help each other. Therefore, it is most appropriate for fish merchants to collect fishery construction fees on behalf of the government.</p>
<h3 id="e183">Understanding the Difficulties <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>Since the establishment of this association, it has held five meetings, resolving various regulations, the reorganization plan for marine fisheries protection in the Jiangsu and Zhejiang region, the reorganization and development plan for fisheries in the Jiangsu and Zhejiang region, paying attention to the protection and research of freshwater fisheries, and proposing to organize a weather forecast plan for important fishery locations in the Jiangsu and Zhejiang region. However, both this association and the Fishery Construction Fee Collection Office are newly established, and the review and filing of various regulations has taken a considerable amount of time. Therefore, various procedures have not yet been fully implemented in accordance with the planned schedule, and the appointment of staff and the handling of affairs still need to be reorganized. In the future, all matters will be handled with openness as much as possible. Yesterday, the Ministry issued an order to send personnel to supervise the collection of fishery construction fees, and a temporary meeting was held on the 21st, with Minister Chen of the Ministry of Industries personally visiting Shanghai to preside over everything, which is the starting point for reorganization. In short, both the country and society are living organizations, and the people should do their best to promote national and social construction in order to maintain the status of the nation and individuals. Today, industries such as cotton, tea, and silk in our country are all under the pressure of foreign forces and are showing a declining trend. The cotton, tea, and silk industries are each raising special funds to try to save themselves. The decline of the fisheries industry and its encroachment by foreigners are actually even more severe than the cotton, tea, and silk industries. Therefore, the collection of fishery construction fees and their designation as special funds is a matter that should not be delayed any further. All fishermen and fish merchants should understand the government's difficulties.</p>
<h3 id="e184">Jiangsu-Zhejiang Fish Industry Federation Telegraphs Request to Abolish Fishery Construction Fees <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>The Jiangsu-Zhejiang Fish Industry Federation sent a telegram to various government organs, stating (titles omitted): Upon investigation, in April of the 20th year of the Republic [1931], Executive Yuan Order No. 1600 and National Government Secretariat Order No. 2487 approved the exemption of all fish taxes and fishing taxes. Since then, no matter what kind of organization, it is not allowed to establish another name to collect this kind of damaging tax, etc., according to the order. All fishermen and fish merchants were deeply fortunate, thinking that the government sympathized with the fish business, with no collection being too small. However, recently, the establishment of the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Regional Fisheries Improvement Committee and the Fishery Construction Fee Collection Office has suddenly occurred. The association falsely claims to be organized by Jiangsu-Zhejiang fishermen and fish merchant groups, but upon investigation, well-known fishing areas on the outer seas and inner rivers of the two provinces, as well as formal fish merchant organizations, have absolutely not been informed of this matter. It is obvious that a small number of people are thinking of profiting from it and are not legally organized. Since its establishment, it has violated central laws in the name of construction, established collection sub-offices in various districts within the jurisdiction of the two provinces, and ordered fish vendors and merchants in various places to collect funds on their behalf. What is meant by collecting on behalf? Because this fund, which the association claims to take from fisheries, should be directly collected from fishermen in marine fishing areas as usual. However, the association clearly knows that it is impossible to collect from fishermen in terms of law and fact, so it employs other tricks, changing it to the two words "collecting on behalf," adding it to fish merchants and vendors. However, they do not know that there are various impossibilities for merchants and vendors to collect on behalf. In fact, because fishermen rely on government laws and orders, they will resist to the death if they are collected from, this is one reason why it cannot be collected on behalf. Fish vendors directly trade with fishermen, so charging merchants to collect from fish vendors, who operate on a small scale and are not actually qualified, will definitely not admit extra expenses, this is the second reason why it cannot be collected on behalf. Merchants and vendors often extend credit to fishermen in their transactions according to custom, so if they are forced to collect on behalf, there will inevitably be many entanglements in the accounts in the future, and the result will still be a loss for the merchants, this is the third reason why it cannot be collected on behalf. The so-called "collecting on behalf" by the association is actually extorting donations layer by layer from fish merchants. For example, in the same fishing area, if the fee has already been collected in District A, it must be collected again when transported to District B. The same is true for transportation from District B to Districts C and D. In essence, fees are collected when the slip is issued, when the goods are transported, and when they land, which is no different from the establishment of a checkpoint by a likin bureau to collect donations. Moreover, the principle of collection is said to be "taking from fisheries," but the method of collection requires payment regardless of whether the products are fresh, salted, dried, or shellfish. Therefore, all dried shellfish products transported from overseas and other provinces, which have already been taxed by customs, are also subject to collection. May I ask, what method can merchants use to obtain the right to collect from fishermen overseas and in other provinces for these shellfish goods? I am afraid that there is no such method in the world. Furthermore, its charter stipulates that those under 100 catties [approximately 133 pounds] are exempt from collection, but recent investigations of fee collection receipts show that those weighing only 30 to 40 catties [approximately 40 to 53 pounds] have been extorted, and even a single item on the list is not named, yet they are extorted for as much as several tens of yuan. All of this is well-documented. It is said that the association relies on powerful backers, and is determined to have its own way, sending people out to inspect merchant account books and investigate operating capital, as if, in addition to collecting disguised likin, they must also add a business tax. If they are slightly dissatisfied, they often detain ships and goods, not only causing fresh fish and other items to rot and be discarded, making them unsaleable, but also harshly stipulating penalties, imposing fines of five to ten times the amount, resulting in uncountable losses of commercial capital. Such harassment and oppression are truly unbearable for fish merchants. The Shanghai and Hangzhou Municipal Chambers of Commerce have repeatedly telegraphed the Ministry of Industries, ordering them to stop it and requesting prompt changes to the implementation method, but no instructions have been received. We beseech you to consider the pain of the merchants and not recognize this kind of disguised likin and extra business tax. In addition to submitting this report separately, we have attached evidence of violations and four photographs for your examination and verification. We beg you to quickly issue a clear order to stop it and abolish the original plan in order to relieve the merchants of Jiangsu of their distress and exempt them from harsh levies. The merchants of Jiangsu and Zhejiang will be greatly fortunate. The Jiangsu-Zhejiang Fish Industry Federation bows and submits.</p>

<p>Suggestions for Rescuing the Rural Economy and Organizing a Committee to Cut Land Taxes: The All-Zhejiang Public Association held its eighth general membership meeting at 3:00 PM yesterday at the Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association on the second floor of Xizang Road, and elected 75 directors. More than 180 people attended, chaired by Chu Huiseng and Yin Yongfu. The details of the meeting are recorded below.</p>
<h3 id="e186">Attendees <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>

<p>The meeting was chaired by Chu Huiseng and Yin Yongfu, with Sheng Liangfu as the recorder and Yu Hualong as the master of ceremonies. After the customary rituals, Chairman Chu Huiseng reported: (1) Association Affairs: Since the establishment of the association at the general assembly in the 20th year of the Republic [1931], the September 18th Incident and the January 28th Incident occurred successively. The association participated in national salvation work, and its own affairs were suspended. What can be reported in these two years: (A) Rescuing the Rural Economy: In recent years, the price of silkworm cocoons has fallen, and the countryside has declined. The association has suggested that the government issue silk industry public bonds to subsidize silkworm cocoon exports, totaling 30,000 dan [approximately 3.97 million pounds]. It has also increased the tax rate on artificial silk imports. (B) Delaying Salt Tax: The Legislative Yuan resolved to unify salt prices, collecting 5 yuan per dan and abolishing surtaxes. The association suggested that the government levy higher taxes on Zhejiang salt than elsewhere in order to prevent the dumping of foreign salt. Once the salt tax is unified, salt from Qingdao, Changlu, and Fujian will flood in, and salt farmers will not be able to maintain their livelihoods. Later, the Legislative Yuan decided to postpone implementation. (C) Promoting Thrift: Foreign imports amount to more than 800 million yuan annually, and the domestic production rate has decreased accordingly. The association held a thrift promotion campaign, which was quite effective. (2) Fundraising Situation: This session raised funds from 66 special teams, totaling 17,558 shares, and 260 general teams, totaling 17,089 shares, for a total of 34,647 shares. (3) Accounting Summary: In the 20th year, income was 4,389 yuan, and expenditure was 4,263 yuan and 17 cents. In the 21st year, income was 32,638 yuan and 53 cents, and expenditure was 7,541 yuan and 38 cents.</p>
<h3 id="e188">Resolutions <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>Next, the discussion began: (1) Amendment to the Association's Constitution: Resolved: Approved with amendments. (2) Suggestions for Rescuing the Rural Economy: Resolved: On the positive side: A. Issue county public bonds; B. Establish farmers' lending institutions; C. Increase the price of rural products. On the negative side: A. Abolish exorbitant taxes; B. Reduce transportation costs for rural products; C. Strictly prohibit the import of opium and red pills. (3) Petition to the Zhejiang Provincial Government to Change the Loan Methods of the Farmers' Bank: Resolved: A. Organize credit cooperatives; borrowers must be members, and loan notes must be guaranteed by the cooperative. B. All farmers and tenants, except those with bad habits, may join the cooperative and may request the cooperative's introduction to borrow from the Farmers' Bank. C. Borrowers must designate a certain crop from this year's harvest as collateral, and the amount of the loan is limited to 40% of the value of the collateral. D. The Farmers' Bank and the cooperative have priority over the borrower's collateral, which is protected by government regulations. (4) Petition to the Zhejiang Provincial Government to Change the Surveying System, Conduct Surveys to Reduce Land Measurement Fees, and Ease the People's Burden: Resolved: Surveying fees must be funded by the government and must not be collected from farmers to alleviate the burden. (5) Petition to the Government to Reduce the Additional Land Tax: Resolved: The association will establish a special committee to reduce the additional land tax. Next, the Yi Fangshuo Mental Troupe performed arts, and the meeting adjourned at 7:00 PM.</p>
<h3 id="e189">The General Labor Union Held a Labor Education Lecture Meeting Yesterday <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal General Labor Union held a labor education lecture meeting at 2:00 PM yesterday at the Juvenile Propaganda Corps. Tao Baichuan and Lu Jingshi from the Municipal Party Headquarters, Zhu Xuefan and Ye Xianggao from the General Labor Union, and Zhou Xuexiang, representatives from various labor unions, and more than 200 others attended. The meeting was chaired by Zhu Xuefan. After the customary rituals, the chairman reported that the General Labor Union, in view of the fact that workers work like cattle and horses without the opportunity to receive education, had initiated the labor education lecture meeting, hoping that the workers would use their useful time for meaningful recreation. Next, Tao Baichuan gave a speech, saying that the slogan of our labor movement is the "3-8 system." Although some factories already have eight hours of rest and eight hours of work, the eight hours of education have not yet been realized, so the General Labor Union is holding this labor education lecture meeting, meaning that we hope that the workers can obtain considerable knowledge. My topic is "The Way Out for Workers During the National Crisis." An ancient saying goes, "One wrong step leads to eternal regret, and it is too late to turn back after a hundred years." Therefore, everything should be carefully considered. As for the way out for workers, it should be sought along with the way out for the country. The place where the country finds its way out is also the place where the workers find their way out. If the country is happy, the workers are happy. If the country suffers disaster, the workers also suffer disaster. The way out for the country is: (1) to develop industry, so that the country can become rich and strong. Some people say that to make China strong, we must first overthrow imperialism, but it is better not to buy their goods. If we do not buy Japanese goods but buy British goods, it is still the same. Our nine boycotts of goods have only a few domestic goods that can replace them. (2) Peaceful reunification. If the country still cannot be peacefully reunified, then the goods produced will not be enough to pay taxes, so industry cannot develop. Therefore, to achieve the above two items, (1) workers should work hard to develop industry, (2) the people should use their strength to make the country peacefully reunified, so that the development of industry can be achieved. I hope that all of you will put this into practice. Next, the postal workers' union performed silk and bamboo music, and the Lianhua Film Company screened the film "Iron-Blooded Heroes." The meeting adjourned at 6:00 PM.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Charity Organizations Joint Association for the Relief of Northeastern Refugees, Vice Chairman Xiong Xiling, convened leaders from all walks of life the day before yesterday to discuss the issue of post-war relief in the North China war zone. They jointly telegraphed Chairman Lin of the National Government and the National Economic Commission, urging them to provide urgent relief to disaster victims and wounded soldiers. Yesterday, they received replies, which are recorded below: (1) To the Charitable Organizations Joint Association for the Relief of Northeastern Refugees, the two telegrams regarding cold and salt have been submitted to the Executive Yuan for review and reply by Chairman Lin. Please note. Wei Huaixiao, Chief of the Civil Service of the National Government. (2) To the Charitable Organizations Joint Association for the Relief of Northeastern Refugees, I have received your telegram. This time, the North China war zone has suffered a great disaster. Your association is compassionate and strives to provide relief, which is admirable. I will ask Vice Chairman Song to review and handle the request for funding and reply later. Qin Fenxian.</p>
<h3 id="e191">The Unbearable Disaster in Shaanxi <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>The Shaanxi Disaster Relief Officer of the Red Swastika Society reported to the World Red Swastika Society that, previously, due to the severity of the disaster in Shaanxi, a relief fund of 30,000 yuan was specially raised, and Society President Li Zhizhen and Society President Wang Zhengui were publicly recommended to lead relief officers Han Wu, Zhang Huasheng, etc., to Shaanxi for investigation and emergency relief. The Shanghai General Office received a fast letter report from the relief affairs commissioner, stating that Shaanxi Province has suffered drought since the 17th year of the Republic [1928], and there have been disasters every year for six years, and no disaster has been light. More than 20 counties in the province have been affected by the disaster, with Wugong, Fufeng, Mei County, Liquan, Qishan, Xingping, Qian County, and eight other places being the most severely affected. Among the eight counties, Wugong and Fufeng are the most tragic. The mountains are barren, and the fields are infertile. Many disaster victims sell their wives and daughters and exchange children to eat. They demolish houses and break beams to use as firewood. In the other six counties, they fill their stomachs with weeds to prolong their lives, and beggars are everywhere, roasting and forcing people to give them food after they meet. In addition, hungry wolves eat people, only one in ten cattle remain, and seven out of ten people have died. Those who have not died have corpses on their faces. They dare not go home during the day and only sneak back to cultivate at night. In this situation, giving food is secondary. The most important thing is that the government must exempt them from grain taxes in order to avoid the great disaster, etc. Reading it, the stone man sheds tears. The association has telegraphed the Relief Committee on the day of the Xinyou to forward it to the National Government to appeal for the exemption of grain taxes in the most severely affected areas, so that the people of the province who are in deep water and fire can have a ray of hope.</p>

<p>Three Measures to Combat Banditry Decided: The Dinghai Fellow Villagers Association in Shanghai, in view of the rampant bandits in the Dinghai urban and rural areas in recent days, robbing day and night, causing panic among residents, and even opening coffins and digging up graves, which is unbearable to witness, yesterday specially convened fellow villagers in Shanghai to hold a dinner party at the Fanhuangdu Club of the Mainland Shopping Center to jointly raise funds to combat banditry. More than 100 people attended, including Liu Hongsheng, Chen Yiting, Xu Tingzuo, Lu Jiaxing, and Yuan Yangan. First, Liu Hongsheng reported the purpose of the meeting, followed by Chen Yiting's report on the rampant bandits in Dinghai, roughly saying that recently, many guest-registered vagrants have been found in Dinghai, causing trouble in the urban and rural areas during the day and stealing and robbing at night, even opening coffins and digging up graves, doing everything. How should we find a way to stop it? I hope that fellow villagers will jointly find a way. After discussion among the crowd, three measures were decided: (1) The Fellow Villagers Association will send a letter to the Zhejiang Provincial Government, requesting that the various counties be strictly ordered to arrest bandits. (2) Send a letter to the Dinghai County Magistrate, requesting that the town chiefs be ordered to be responsible for investigating the behavior of villagers. (3) Send a letter to the Zhejiang Provincial Government, requesting that the household registration law and the baojia law be strictly enforced to prohibit guest-registered vagrants from lingering. Then, the meeting discussed methods for recruiting new members. It was decided to appoint Liu Hongsheng as the general captain of the recruitment team and Chen Yiting as the deputy captain. All other attendees were appointed as team captains.</p>

<p>The English-language China Year Book, compiled by H.G.W. Woodhead, has long been popular at home and abroad and has been published fifteen times to date. The latest 1933 edition was published recently. The content is richer than previous editions, divided into 27 chapters and hundreds of sub-items, covering not only the United States but also valuable statistics. It is particularly detailed for Chinese and foreign trade. According to the author, this book took nine months to compile and several months to print. Even the index at the end of the book took three weeks to compile in detail, hoping that readers can find anything they want to check with one search. Its accuracy is evident. Many chapters in the book are compiled or revised by famous experts at home and abroad, and even the chapters compiled by the author himself are based on official books and documents. For example, the Greater Shanghai Chapter, the Chinese Art Chapter, and the Catholic Chapter were not previously available. All statistics, except for the complete 1931 data, include the 1932 statistics that could be collected in the first three months of this year. The new import tariff announced in late May was also included in the appendix when it was about to be printed, which shows the novelty of its materials. The entire book is 850,000 words, approximately 800 pages, and priced at 20 yuan. It is sold by the North China Daily News &amp; Herald.</p>

<p>Taihe Summer Medicines Sell Well: Since the beginning of summer, the Taihe Pharmacy on Fourth Road has been making refined medicines that are suitable for the market, such as Taihe Flower Water, Prickly Heat Powder, Fruit Dew, Epidemic Water, Stink Water, Camphor Brandy, and internal medicine 606, all of which are of excellent quality. Wholesale and retail sales from both local and foreign locations are endless, and there is a strong trend of supply falling short of demand. In addition, the Pharmacy's refined Finasa and medicinal water are spiritual medicines for treating skin eczema, tinea, scabies, and foot fungus. Washing the affected area with it immediately reduces dampness and relieves itching. If there is ulceration, applying 606 ointment will draw out toxins and promote healing, which is especially fast. At this time of summer, sales are very strong.</p>

<p>Compiled and translated by Sun Huairen, the book contains a full volume of pages in a 32mo format with a real price of 2 jiao and 5 fen. This book is compiled and translated by Mr. Sun Huairen based on the Japanese publications "Modern Personality Review," "Scenery of Political Figures," "Transforming Japanese Personality Scenery," and magazines such as "Central Public Opinion," "Reconstruction," "Political World Affairs," "Modern One," and "Eloquence," with his own views added. We know that everyone's thoughts and actions are determined by their individual social relationships. Certain societies produce certain figures; it is never the case that certain figures produce certain societies. Especially for figures on the political stage, the influence of social relations is particularly profound and significant. Therefore, if we want to study each individual, we cannot obtain any correct results if we separate them from their social relationships. At the same time, it seems unnecessary in fact to study each person's individual thoughts and actions separately from social relationships. However, on the other hand, we cannot deny that individual thoughts and actions can also influence society to some extent. Especially the figures on the Japanese political stage, under Japan's overall policy of aggression against China, their every word and action is even more worthy of our attention. Therefore, the creation of this book also has its significant meaning. Due to space limitations, the book only includes ten figures. According to the compiler, the remaining figures will be written about in a sequel. These ten people are: 1. Uchida Kosai, 2. Ugaki Kazushige, 3. Wakatsuki Reijiro, 4. Suzuki Kisaburo, 5. Adachi Kenzo, 6. Shidehara Kijuro, 7. Saito Makoto, 8. Yoshizawa Kenkichi, 9. Osumi Mineo, 10. Matsuoka Yosuke. All ten of these are active figures on the current Japanese political stage. It is very interesting to see how they behave in their daily lives and how they relate to our country. Anyone who wants to study Japanese political affairs, in addition to paying attention to the entire political relationship of Japan, this book is indeed worth reading.</p>

<p>— Pang Jingzhou</p>
<p>Chapter 5: Administration of Medicine</p>
<p>Section 1: Historical Background of Government Offices</p>
<p>China has a very ancient history of medical administration. The earliest can be considered the medical officials in the Zhou Li (Rites of Zhou). However, there is no record of it after that. Later, there was only the so-called Tai Hospital, which was a gathering place for imperial physicians. However, it was not an organization that managed national medical affairs, cared for the people's suffering, or organized national medicine. In recent decades, due to the eastward spread of European trends, there has been the reality of government offices managing medicine.</p>
<p>Around the time of the Guangxu years Ji Hai and Geng Zi (1899-1900), Ke Fengshi, the prefect of Jiangning Prefecture, advocated in Nanjing the examination of Chinese and Western medicine. More than 700 Chinese medicine practitioners took the exam, but only over 100 were selected. More than 40 Western medicine practitioners took the exam, but only over 10 were selected. This can be said to be the beginning of health laws. At that time, official orders were much stronger than they are now. If they had been strictly enforced from that time on, the medical community today would not be so chaotic. Unfortunately, Mr. Ke was also ahead of his time and lacked support from others. After he left office, his successor adhered to the wonderful saying of adapting to the times and delayed the matter again. Later, when Duan Wuqiao became the governor of Jiangsu, he also advocated examining doctors in Suzhou Prefecture. Furthermore, he also formulated medical practice regulations, allowing only two yuan per visit and ordering doctors not to use sedan chairs, but only to ride donkeys, in order to be quick. The ideas were indeed novel, but they were inevitably too hasty. Therefore, at that time, a certain old gentleman in Suzhou, because he had served as an imperial physician, was ashamed to be assessed and preferred to avoid the area and stay in Shanghai for a short time, waiting until Duan Fang left office before returning home. This shows that the medical community in our country is inherently difficult to manage. Around the years of the Republic of China, 1913-1914, the Ministry of Internal Affairs in Beijing specially established a Health Department, which first conducted various health administrations on a trial basis in Beijing, also managing national medical and pharmaceutical affairs. The term "physician" originated at this time. (Note that this term is based on ancient books and is not copied from the term "lawyer"). Later, health sections were established in the police departments of major cities. The health sections then established health bureaus. Shanghai and Beijing were among the earliest. It was not until the completion of the Northern Expedition and the establishment of the capital in Nanjing that the Ministry of Health was established based on the Founding Program of the late Premier. At that time, the entire medical community nationwide gladly told each other, feeling that since there was a special ministry to administer health, the medical community, although subject to its jurisdiction, also had more protection. Unexpectedly, the state of the nation deteriorated day by day, and the Ministry of Health had a large department but small tasks, so it had to be changed to the Health Administration. That is the current Health Administration. However, because the ministry was changed to an administration, it seems that the political power has been reduced again. The current phenomenon is that the central government only tells the Health Administration to manage some "decorative health" and some "foreign medicine." But the Health Administration also says there is no way. However, this is not in line with my above-mentioned original intention of implementing policies. To talk about the legacy of the late Premier, it feels even further away.</p>
<h3 id="e202">A Discussion on Cun Kou Pulse Diagnosis <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Yunxiu</p>
<p>Now that anatomy is clear, the artery on the radial side of the wrist should also be recognized for its true identity and understood for its nature. Anatomical models are displayed in educational instrument stores everywhere, and physiology is taught in secondary schools across the country. I believe that at least those who have received secondary education or above should know the origin and function of the radial artery. Why is it that when old doctors now diagnose illnesses, they solemnly extend three fingers and press them on the patient's radial artery, putting on a look of concentration, as if they can know the cause of the disease, and still openly write liver pulse, kidney pulse, etc. in the medical records? If it is said that they are making wild statements without knowing anything, why is no one refuting them? If it is said that they are engaging in fraudulent behavior, why is no one intervening? From this, it can be seen that the people of the country completely lack a practical and truth-seeking mentality, the perseverance to thoroughly study things, and are all vague. (Recently, people write sloppily) They only care about the present and disregard the future. As a result, the entire country, from top to bottom, only talks about interests, not right and wrong; only cares about personal matters, not national affairs. It is really heartbreaking! Now, the National Medicine Hall, which uses "scientific methods to organize national medicine," still emphasizes pulse diagnosis and disregards everything else in the national medicine regulations it has formulated. Isn't that crazy?</p>
<p>In my book "Collection of Medical Revolution Theories," Volume 4, I published an article "On Pulse Books with the Chinese Medicine Association." Now I will transform the eleven major reasons for refuting the pulse theory of old medicine into a popular vernacular to discuss with the people of the country who have received secondary education or above.</p>
<p>(1) What is the true identity of the pulse?</p>
<p>Arteries all come out of the left ventricle of the heart, branching and networking throughout the body. Its inside is empty, like a rubber tube. Its purpose is to infuse arterial blood into the tissues of the whole body to provide nutrients. When the heart beats, it forces the blood from the left ventricle into the artery, and the artery also beats, forcing the blood in the artery forward a step. Like this, one beat after another, it continues to circulate arterial blood throughout the body. The radial artery is just one of thousands of branches and has nothing special. However, it passes through the cun kou area and is relatively close to the subcutaneous tissue, making it easy to touch. Its beating follows the beating of the heart. The pulse rate is the heart rate; the pulse is slow when the heart rate is slow; the pulse is regular or irregular when the heart rate is regular or irregular. It is absolutely no different from the arteries throughout the body. This is a very obvious fact and an easy-to-understand principle. Now, the old doctors insist on regarding the artery at the cun kou as the pulse of the Hand Taiyin Lung Meridian, and also say that it is the source of all pulses, and also say that it can treat all diseases and determine life and death. It is clearly blind nonsense. Please pay attention to the people of the country and investigate, so that you can understand their mistakes.</p>
<p>(2) Who first advocated the method of only diagnosing the cun kou pulse?</p>
<p>The books that the old doctors now regard as the golden rule are the "Su Wen" of the Yellow Emperor and the "Shang Han Lun" of Zhang Zhongjing. The pulse method in the "Su Wen" only has the "Three Divisions and Nine Examinations" and the "Ren Ying and Qi Kou" methods. The "Three Divisions and Nine Examinations" method examines the pulse from the head to the feet, where there are arteries to diagnose. This is clearly stated in the "Three Divisions and Nine Examinations" chapter of the "Su Wen." It absolutely does not teach people to only diagnose the cun kou artery. The "Ren Ying and Qi Kou" method refers to the artery on both sides of the throat, called the "Ren Ying," and the arteries at the left and right cun kou, called the "Qi Kou." They are diagnosed at the same time and compared with each other. It also absolutely does not teach people to only diagnose the cun kou artery. As for Zhang Zhongjing's "Shang Han Lun," he often says "cun kou die yang." Scholars have different opinions on where "die yang" is. This is another question. But it can prove that Zhongjing did not only diagnose the cun kou artery. Moreover, the preface of the "Shang Han Lun" also speaks of the ugly situation of relying on cun kou pulse diagnosis, which further shows that Zhongjing opposed only diagnosing the cun kou artery. Later, Yang Shangshan and others also expressed dissatisfaction with the cun kou pulse method. It can be seen that the cun kou pulse diagnosis method was not the correct method in the Han, Wei, and Six Dynasties. A group of scholars looked down on it. However, its origin lies in the "Nan Jing" (Classic of Difficulties). In the Han, Wei, and Six Dynasties, some people also used the cun kou pulse diagnosis method to diagnose patients. Because a group of scholars looked down on it, it did not become popular. Later, etiquette between men and women became more and more serious. It was really inconvenient to touch the head and feet. Coincidentally, there was a method of only diagnosing the cun kou, which only required touching the hand, which was convenient. Therefore, his method gradually became popular. This was the act of itinerant doctors at the time who were making compromises to cater to society, and it was not a legitimate method passed down from ancient times. Now, the old doctors regard it as if it were a sacred scripture, deeply believing and practicing it, only caring about convenience and not thinking about the source. I want to ask the people of the country to investigate the history of the cun kou pulse diagnosis method. You can know that the pulse diagnosis method of the current national doctors is a crude and simplified technique from the streets, and it is truly worthless. It is not some kind of golden rule passed down from the system of ancient sages. (To be continued)</p>

<p>— Hu Jiayan</p>
<p>"Paralysis, consumption, bloating, and diaphragmatic obstruction are four incurable serious illnesses." Almost everyone knows this saying. When the author was young, he often heard his elders say this. When he was about to graduate from medical school, he encountered relatives and friends asking repeatedly, do you have any new treatments for these four major diseases? I feel that answering this question cannot be covered by a simple "yes" or "no," because the terms in our country have always been too abstract, and disease names are no exception. For example, among these four diseases, excluding "consumption," which represents our "tuberculosis," narrowly speaking, pulmonary tuberculosis, which is still a disease name, the other three, paralysis is a simplified term for wind paralysis, containing the meaning of numbness, insensitivity, and hemiplegia; bloating refers to abdominal distension, which is the same as what we call ascites, but if there is gas accumulation in the abdomen, causing abdominal distension (commonly called)</p>
<h3 id="e204">The Science of Nurturing Life (20) <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Songyun</p>
<p>(16) Physical Quietness</p>
<p>(A) Postpartum Sleep</p>
<p>The postpartum mother's bedroom should be spacious, quiet, and well-ventilated. The room temperature should be around 18 degrees Celsius. Sunlight and ventilation should not be direct. In addition to doctors, midwives, or nurses, the number of people entering and leaving the room should be limited to maintain cleanliness and tranquility. At this time, the mother's spirit is easily affected. Whether it is joy, anger, sorrow, or happiness, be careful not to cause any emotions. Therefore, within two or three days after delivery, it is important to ensure quiet sleep day and night, so that the mind and body are at peace and the senses are not disturbed. Do not arbitrarily get up and move around to avoid the risk of fever and bleeding. The mother herself and her family should pay full attention.</p>
<p>(B) Ten Days of Experience After Delivery</p>
<p>The period of confinement after delivery was previously thought to be sufficient for three weeks of rest. However, in reality, to obtain sufficient rest after childbirth, it should be within six weeks. Because getting up too early has various harms, such as increased bleeding, easy onset of fever, and easy changes in the position and shape of the uterus, as well as the risk of blood clots and embolisms.</p>
<p>How can the mind and body be quiet? The ten days of experience after delivery can tell us. Because the postpartum life is the life of a seriously ill person, it requires extreme quietness. All activities outside the bed should be handled slowly after the possible period. Now, I will describe my experience as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Lying on your back for the first two days. After delivery, absolute quietness is needed, as mentioned above. For the first two days, the mother should lie on her back to prevent air from entering the uterus. Eating and defecating should be done in bed. Do not get up to go to the toilet.</p>
<p>(3) Side lying after three days. On the third day, eating and breastfeeding can be done freely while lying on your side. On the fourth day, you can change the direction of sleep at will. If you are fixed on one side, the position of the uterus may deteriorate. If you lie on your back for too long, it may cause retroversion of the uterus. Therefore, it is best to alternate between the left and right sides.</p>
<p>(2) Sitting up after five days. After five or six days, you can sit up casually for breastfeeding, defecation, eating, and other things, but you should still not leave the bed. Otherwise, leaving the bed too early may cause fever or bleeding.</p>
<p>(4) Moving slightly after ten days. After ten days or two weeks, if the uterine contraction is good and the lochia is normal, you can get up slightly, but it is still best to spend more time in bed. Generally, you should not formally leave the bed until at least three weeks later. Do not overwork within six weeks.</p>

<p>(Air bloating) is also included; diaphragmatic obstruction refers to the patient's difficulty in swallowing food, often leading to starvation. These three explanations are probably not different from what ordinary people say, right? But in the final analysis, they are completely symptoms of a disease and cannot be regarded as disease names. For example, paralysis can include cerebral hemorrhage, spinal cord tuberculosis, and myelitis, and even beriberi can sometimes completely prevent movement, so it may not be bad to include it; cirrhosis of the liver and heart and kidney diseases are certainly bloating, and so is tuberculous peritonitis. Based on this point, it is impossible to answer immediately whether it can be cured or not. I will now classify and detail the possible diseases under these symptoms, and at the same time, I will also point out the differences in prognosis, treatment, and each symptom. I feel that such a description is a systematic answer. Consumption, that is, tuberculosis, can already be regarded as a specific disease name, and it will be described in the last chapter of this article.</p>
<p>(1) Paralysis</p>
<p>In the new medicine, there are indeed many possible diseases that are considered paralysis by ordinary people, especially in the spinal cord. Among them, more important and common diseases include cerebral hemorrhage, spinal cord tuberculosis, myelitis, multiple sclerosis, spinal paralysis, spastic spinal paralysis, acute ascending spinal paralysis, and progressive paralysis. In addition, chondromalacia, beriberi, and Scheuermann's disease sometimes have conditions similar to paralysis. Regarding the symptoms and prognosis of these diseases, I will now describe each of them separately below:</p>
<p>(1) Cerebral Hemorrhage</p>
<p>This disease is commonly called "stroke" or "sudden stroke" by ordinary people and is one of the brain diseases. The main cause is the rupture of cerebral arteries due to arterial lesions. The patient suddenly becomes unconscious and falls into a coma. At this time, except for breathing and heartbeat, they are almost like a dead person. The face is flushed, the pulse is slow, the breathing is rapid and irregular, the body temperature drops, and movement, sensation, and reflexes are almost completely lost. Severe cases often lead to death. However, if the lesion contracts and the contents of the disintegration are gradually absorbed, the patient will wake up and recover. However, there are also many cases of recurrence leading to multiple episodes and death. Whether the patient returns to their original state after waking up depends greatly on the location of the bleeding. If the bleeding is near the internal capsule, then hemiplegia on the opposite side of the body, the so-called "cerebral hemiplegia," occurs. This affects the facial nerves, hypoglossal nerves, and limbs, with the lower limbs being more pronounced than the upper limbs. In this case, it can sometimes recover slowly, but most cases are difficult to cure. The cause of this disease is mostly arteriosclerosis, so patients are mostly elderly, while middle-aged patients are mostly due to syphilis damaging the arteries. In addition, alcohol and lead poisoning are also contributing factors. Treatment: There is no fixed and effective method. Venous bloodletting is more important, and patients often wake up because of it. Ice packs can be placed on the patient's head, and iodine preparations can be used, but all cardiotonic injections should be prohibited.</p>
<p>(2) Spinal Cord Tuberculosis</p>
<p>The anatomical changes in this disease are in the posterior funiculus of the spinal cord, which is narrow, flat, and gray-white in color. Most of it occurs after suffering from syphilis. Patients initially experience pain in the legs, which is like a lightning strike and similar to neuralgia. In addition, the pupils shrink, and there is rigid reflex. The knee-jerk reflex disappears. At this time, the stomach feels uncomfortable, and there are disorders of bladder and rectal function and optic nerve atrophy. This situation lasts from several weeks to several years, called the neuralgia period. Afterwards, the patient gradually develops symptoms of ataxia in the lower limbs. When walking, they touch the ground with their heels and stride wide, appearing unsteady. If they walk in a straight line, they are so clumsy that they cannot turn their body. In severe cases, if the patient closes their eyes and stands upright with their feet together, their body will sway and tend to fall. This period can also last for several years, called the ataxia period. Finally, the patient cannot walk and is confined to bed. Their feet are numb, immobile, and atrophied. Cystitis and bladder paralysis occur. This is the so-called paraplegia period. The whole process can last for decades. Treatment: In addition to specialized treatment for syphilis, there are few other helpful treatments.</p>
<p>(3) Myelitis</p>
<p>This disease mostly occurs after acute infectious diseases. Those who initially present with chronic symptoms are due to syphilis and multiple sclerosis. The anatomical changes mostly occur in the gray and white matter of the spinal cord. Initially, there are sudden chills, high fever, stiff spine, abnormal sensation in the lower limbs, and complete paralysis occurs in a short time, resulting in paraplegia. In addition, there is bladder and rectal paralysis, which leads to death due to induced cystitis and pyelonephritis. This disease is divided into thoracic myelitis, lumbar myelitis, and cervical myelitis depending on the location of the lesion. The symptoms also vary accordingly. In those with lesions in the cervical or lumbar spinal cord, the prognosis is particularly poor because the respiratory center and bladder and rectal centers are easily invaded. Chronic cases can last from several years to decades, but there is no hope of full recovery. Treatment: Those with syphilis undergo specialized treatment; others use diaphoretics, electrical therapy, and internal administration of salicylic acid and mercury preparations. Antipyretics can also be used for acute cases.</p>
<p>(4) Multiple Sclerosis</p>
<p>Patients with this disease are mostly young adults, with fewer elderly people. Acute infectious diseases and alcohol, lead, and mercury poisoning can all induce this disease, but it is not related to syphilis. The sclerotic lesions are arranged in the entire nervous system, varying in size, with the spinal cord being the most affected, followed by the peripheral nerves of the brain. At the beginning of this disease, there are prodromal symptoms such as headaches, dizziness, and neuralgia. The inherent symptoms of this disease are motor impairment, motor tremor, nystagmus, visual impairment, scanning speech, and bladder, rectal, nutritional, and mental disorders. Regarding motor impairment, it is due to the atrophy or rigidity of various muscles of the body, with the lower limbs being the most affected, resulting in ataxia, similar to spinal cord tuberculosis. This disease rarely causes complete paralysis, but if there is unilateral invasion of the spinal cord or brain, hemiplegia will occur, which is the same as the above-mentioned diseases. This disease rarely directly endangers life, but it is actually an incurable disease. Treatment: There is no specific effective treatment, but injecting Fibrolysin is more effective.</p>
<h3 id="e205">Answers to the Question of Female Chastity <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>— Qu Shaohong</p>
<p>Mr. Yang Zongxun asked about the old method of investigating whether a woman is chaste or not, which always depends on whether there is a new red stain on the first night of the wedding. In recent times, many people have criticized this method of investigation. I don't know if there are actually any errors in practice.</p>
<p>Answering whether a woman is chaste or not based on whether there is a bloodstain during the first night of marriage is the same at home and abroad, in ancient and modern times. In rural Guangdong, during a hall full of guests, the newly married couple enters the bridal chamber immediately. If blood is seen after the first intercourse, it is shown to the public. All the guests congratulate. In Yan customs, on the day after the wedding, the used sanitary cloth is also sent to the woman's house to report the news, which is called reporting the joy. If there is no joy to report, then the woman's family members dare not set foot in the man's house. Such actions are vulgar and ridiculous and are too far from modern academic theory to be used as a model. According to the cause of the bloodstain, it is caused by the rupture of the hymen. However, some people have congenital absence of this membrane. Shaohong has indeed seen it, and the books all clearly record it. Furthermore, according to the research of modern medicine, the cause of hymen rupture is not limited to sexual intercourse. There are many women in the world who are wronged by this condition. This is what advocates of women's rights should pay attention to.</p>
<p>Asking whether hymen rupture is the cause of bleeding. The hymen, in anatomical terms, is a thin membrane that blocks the vaginal opening. It has considerable elasticity, and there are irregular pores on the membrane. The size of the pores varies congenitally, but most do not allow the entry of an adult's organ. Therefore, the first intercourse will inevitably cause a tear and bleeding. The degree of bleeding depends on the size of the tear, as well as the thickness of the membrane, the toughness of the tissue, the size of the pores, the shape of the penis, and the speed of movement.</p>
<p>Asking whether the absence of blood in an old-style woman's wedding can be used as clear evidence of unchastity.</p>
<p>Answering the above two answers makes it clear that it cannot be dismissed with one stroke of the pen. In my personal opinion, if you want to know whether the hymen is complete, there is no other way except to have a doctor examine the virgin. However, this method is already impossible in custom. Moreover, for those with more resilient hymens, they often remain intact even after intercourse. There are even those who have had a miscarriage after five months and are still completely intact. This is even more untrustworthy.</p>
<p>Asking whether there are other causes of hymen rupture besides intercourse.</p>
<p>Answering there are many causes of hymen rupture, such as masturbation, menstruation, external trauma, and gynecological surgery.</p>
<p>Asking whether there are other methods of investigating whether a woman is chaste or not besides the bloodstain.</p>
<p>Answering as mentioned above, but it is not a proper method.</p>
<p>Asking about the structure of the hymen.</p>
<p>Answering the hymen is a ring-shaped mucous membrane fold that originates from the posterior wall of the vagina and is located at the external opening of the vagina. There are small holes on the membrane with different shapes, sizes, and numbers. There are also those with absolutely no holes, which is called imperforate hymen and is not a physiological phenomenon. In addition, there are also cases of increased blood vessels and increased connective tissue, which are not normal for the body.</p>
<p>Asking whether there is pain when a virgin breaks her hymen, and whether the degree of pain is proportional to age.</p>
<p>Answering with a clear understanding of the position, structure, and degree of rupture of the hymen itself as mentioned above, this question is already half-answered.</p>
<p>Asking whether uterine disease can cause the hymen to rupture.</p>
<p>Answering that uterine disease can indirectly make the hymen easier to rupture. There is no direct rupture. It can be caused by the leaching of leucorrhea, which causes itching of the vulva, and by friction. If it is ruptured by surgery due to uterine disease, then it must be discussed separately.</p>

<p>— Knowing</p>
<p>(3) Separation of Glycerin: The lime soap is finely ground and sent to a large barrel using a spiral conveyor. It is then washed with hot water to dissolve the glycerin into the water. The resulting solution is transferred to an evaporation tank and evaporated at low temperature until it reaches a suitable concentration (approximately 80%). Then, it is sent to a filter press. The filtered product is crude glycerin.</p>
<p>(4) Formation of Sodium Soap: The previously washed lime soap is spread into an alkalization pot by a continuous conveyor. Sodium carbonate is added, and steam is introduced with constant stirring. After twelve hours, salt is added to precipitate the sodium soap. The lower layer of waste liquid is then released from the bottom of the pot. The soap colloid inside the pot is mixed with resin liquid and boiled for a period. It is then transferred to a melting pot, where it is boiled into a liquid state and flows out. At the same time, sodium silicate and other substances are added. Using a vacuum pump, the liquid is injected into a condenser, where it solidifies into flat, square soap bars. These are then cut, air-dried, printed, and packed into boxes. Over two thousand boxes can be produced daily, but demand still exceeds supply.</p>
<p>Due to insufficient allocation, new soap kettles are being added and expansion is being actively pursued. Moreover, direct soap production is being increased to compensate for the inadequacy of the indirect method. Simultaneously, efforts are being made to utilize waste materials, conserve fuel, and conduct other research and experimental work in an orderly manner. Recently, industrial chemistry expert Mr. Shen Zhennan has been hired to supervise and guide the work. In the near future, there will certainly be remarkable achievements to contribute to the public.</p>

<p>In addition, there are more than one hundred types of soap, including Zhonghua Xingji scented soap, Gubenzhao scented soap, medicated soap, and neutral soap (silk washing soap). Most of their base materials are produced using the direct method, and the raw materials used are even purer. Details will not be repeated here.</p>
<p>As for the refining of glycerin (i.e., Western honey), it is also one of the factory’s important goals. Mr. Zeng Guangfang is currently in charge of this matter. It is said that it has been decided to establish a separate factory on Columbia Road, dedicated to the manufacturing of glycerin. All necessary double-effect concentration pots, boiling kettles, stirring tanks, centrifugal liquid separators, high-vacuum distillers, etc., are either being manufactured domestically or ordered from abroad. All have been arranged separately, and the factory building is being rushed to completion. It is expected that the first shipments will be formally available after Double Ten Day (October 10th).</p>

<p>— Hua Ling</p>
<p>According to biologists, the ancestors of mankind were four-legged, cave-dwelling, blood-drinking, and hair-covered beasts. After hundreds of thousands of years of transmission, they somehow transformed their two front hooves into hands, and their two hind legs learned to stand up and walk. And so, hehe, they gradually became like humans.</p>
<p>Once humans had two hands, their abilities became much greater than those of animals. They found cave dwelling uncomfortable, so they used their hands to build thatched huts, and then ships, all the way to eighteen-story buildings. They found eating raw meat and drinking blood unpalatable, so they used their hands to cook and prepare food, adding oil, salt, soy sauce, vinegar, garlic, and scallions, all the way to five-spice powder and delicious spicy soy sauce.</p>
<p>The functions of hands are not limited to building houses and cooking. They are simply omnipotent. To put it plainly, hands can flatter, can earn money, and also promote people, snatch jobs, commit murder and arson, extort, calculate on an abacus, and count banknotes. There is nothing that doesn't require the use of hands. Our four-legged ancestors could never have dreamed of such all-encompassing abilities.</p>
<p>Humans have two hands, and in addition to all the above, they can also do things secretly, commonly called "three hands." This is just a joke; how can humans have three hands? But according to biologists, the formation of organs and limbs on the human body is for specific purposes. If a part becomes useless, it will degenerate or form a useful organ. Now, science is advanced, and transportation methods are progressing daily. The function of feet is gradually decreasing. In the future, there will definitely be people without feet who can travel around the Earth in eight days. At the same time, as the need for hands increases, the current two feet will also evolve into hands. Therefore, don't be surprised to see three hands. In the future, mankind will evolve to have four hands.</p>
<p>But I hope that this biologist's theory of evolution is fortunately wrong, because humans with only two hands are already struggling to get bread. If they evolve to have four hands, will they still be alive?</p>
<h3 id="e214">Threshold <a href="#e214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>— Yún Sūn</p>
<p>Shanghai people ridicule anything that is not done cleverly, skillfully, or cunningly with the phrase, "Mǔ bù ménkǎn (嘸不門檻)," which means that you have no threshold, no way to handle something. The current popular term is "art," such as the art of dealing with people, the art of getting along in the world. For example, a friend who likes to visit prostitutes but doesn't know the art of flirting (吊膀子門檻), or someone who is more refined but doesn't know the art of love, will not only fail to succeed but also cause trouble, potentially facing dire consequences. We comrades who submit articles and don't grasp reality in our writing, don't suit the editor's taste, and go against the times are also without a threshold. You can be sure your work will become a prisoner of the wastebasket. Such examples are countless; in short, it's all about lacking a threshold.</p>
<p>In fact, most buildings in Shanghai, with their doors and households, don't have a threshold (門檻) at all. When you occasionally see a house with a threshold, it's always out of place, becoming an eyesore in the city. The word "threshold" doesn't need to be promoted and popularized. Fortunately, clever Shanghai people have come up with the word "art" to replace it. The word "threshold" may become a historical relic. In my hometown, the customs are still simple and honest, and everything is grounded in reality. The explanation of "threshold" is very different. For example, if someone is acting as a matchmaker for a young woman, wanting to arrange a wedding, the parents of the woman will definitely "seriously" say to the matchmaker: "We are a family with a threshold (有門檻的人家), please pay attention to the family of the other party," expressing that their daughter's chamber is well-guarded, and they are not willing to casually marry her off. They also indicate that there are many unruly women without a threshold.</p>
<p>Alas, our great Republic of China was originally a family of poetry and propriety for decades, always respected by its neighbors as a noble household with a threshold. Now, the doors are wide open. Since the September 18th Incident, Shenyang, Jilin, Heilongjiang, Rehe, and Shanhaiguan—one after another, the main doors, inner doors, waist doors, and screen doors—have fallen into enemy hands, seized by the strong enemy as their own, turning us into a household without a threshold.</p>
<p>Even though "ten-thousand-foot-high walls cannot stop someone who is determined to come," a jumping clown sneaks in under your threshold, and the guard doesn't even know the importance of the threshold? Letting him sneak in is truly an unexpected thing. The landlady exhausts the threshold of resistance and negotiation, but still cannot repel the enemy's ambition, fearing that she will end up as a household without a threshold? Xunzi's "Discussion on Military Affairs" says, "Annexation is easy, but consolidation is difficult." Consolidation means stability; strength is, of course, important. We are currently neither strong nor stable, so our threshold is being seized. Now the landlady is using the slogan "internal pacification before external resistance," which is probably the idea behind it?</p>
<h3 id="e215">The Busy Season for Pawnshops <a href="#e215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>— Xing Zhi</p>
<p>In this weather, where the mercury in the thermometer is gradually rising, when fashionable friends on the street are fluttering around in Indian silk, Burmese silk, and Chinese silk gauze, and little girls are carrying flower-cloth umbrellas, the masters in the pawnshops are brightening their faces and putting on airs, taking advantage of the poor. Outside the high walls, between the monk's head and the screen, friends with small packages tucked under their arms come and go like shuttles, while the pawnshop masters, with their bell-like eyes and capitalist-like tone, stand outside the high counters, eating their ice-cold "bullets" (referring to money).</p>
<p>Of the four seasons, summer is considered the most lovable by the proletarian people. Although the rich and idle classes try to avoid it, the poor and miserable people only hope that every one of the three hundred and sixty-five days of the year is summer. Where would they avoid it? Of course, the lives of the rich and the poor, although both are human, are absolutely separated into two different worlds. In the summer, the poor only need a single layer of clothing. Winter's cotton-padded coats and quilts can be tossed over the high walls to be pawned in the pawnshop. How refreshing!</p>
<p>Whenever winter descends upon the world, when the northwest wind howls, it is the time for modern girls to show off. The fur collar of their leather coats is exposed in the northwest wind. Isn't that showing off? But the brows of poor friends are furrowing. They have to scrape together money to redeem their cotton clothes from the pawnshop. And so, outside the high walls, between the monk's head and the screen, friends with small packages tucked under their arms once again come and go like shuttles. The pawnshop masters use their thirteen-column abacuses and inevitably shave off an edge from the Yuan head (silver coins) in the hands of the poor. Outside the high counter, they have no choice but to bow their heads and accept their fate.</p>
<p>Winter goes and summer comes. Summer goes and winter comes again. When winter comes, poor friends furrow their brows and run into the high walls. When summer comes, poor friends unfurl their brows and run into the high walls. Year after year, from winter to summer, from summer to winter, the river flows without ceasing. The small packages of poor friends also jump back and forth between the pawnshops. Summer is the busy season for pawnshops, and winter is also the busy season for pawnshops. The pawnshops in the city have two busy seasons each year.</p>

<p>Madam Jiang looked back and smiled: "Thank you for your trouble. I'm just worried that our daughter is hard to talk to and can't make up her mind." Man Ying said: "I don't think she has any objections. Congratulations!" As she spoke, she left with a smile. How could Guizhi not know about their secretive actions? However, she used to have a Mr. Gan Er in her heart, so she felt that there was no second person in the world she could like. Now that Mr. Gan Er is nowhere to be found, he has shattered her belief in handsome scholars. Although she felt that Company Commander Zhao was not the man she liked best in her heart, there was no one else better than him. His sincere actions and amiable attitude could be said to be better than those of a handsome scholar. If she openly said that she wouldn't marry Zhao Ziqiang, she would feel a little embarrassed in her own heart. Therefore, although she couldn't make up her mind, she just couldn't make up her mind. She knew that the Zhao family was trying their best to find a matchmaker, but she was too embarrassed to say that she wouldn't marry him. In this way, one day passed, and another day passed, and a week passed. This morning, the weather was very good. There was no wind or sand, and it wasn't cold. Guizhi leaned lazily against the door frame, staring at the gate of the Gan family, unknowingly reminiscing about the past. She thought to herself, "It's still better to be a traditional woman. If I were a civilized woman, since Gan had known me for so long, I would do whatever he wanted, and I would definitely be greatly deceived by him. Men are originally so unreliable. He even asked me to wait three years. Even three months, he wouldn't need me to wait." Just as she was thinking this, Company Commander Zhao walked back with a string of pork in his hand. He lowered his head, as if thinking about something. He accidentally raised his head and saw Guizhi. He suddenly paused and stopped moving. Guizhi suddenly remembered the events of the past few days and couldn't help but blush. She turned around and wanted to run. As she thought this, she twisted her body, but her second thought came along. If she turned around and ran, wouldn't that clearly show that she knew about this recent event? Therefore, she immediately stopped and didn't leave, waiting for Zhao Ziqiang to walk over. She smiled at him and said, "Company Commander Zhao is back." (104)</p>

<p>If I told you: the lipstick you love on your lips is extracted from coal; the rouge on your delicate cheeks is made from dead insects; the eyebrow pencil you use to draw your eyebrows is made from burnt bones; the nail polish you apply to your nails is made from dissolved cotton, then you would definitely treat me like a madman because such absurd words are so out of touch. In fact, these words are not only correct, but also very scientific, because most of the various cosmetics that you use every day rely on chemical techniques to achieve such miraculous effects. So, if you want to reveal its true face and tell the public its source, there is really nothing to say other than the few thorough words above. If you still don't believe it, please read the following:</p>
<p>As long as you have the opportunity to enter a large factory that specializes in manufacturing paints, pigments, and cosmetics, you can see a bright red pigment that is extracted from a type of cochineal insect. After these insects are caught, they are put into bags and baked to death. The resulting pigment is called cochineal red, which is used for both paint and rouge. So, to put it bluntly, isn't the rouge you put on your face made from dead insects?</p>
<p>There is also a type of red pigment called Eosin, which is extracted from coal tar. The "lipstick" that modern girls cannot live without is sometimes made with this product. There is a thing called ivory black, which is made by burning ivory into charcoal. It is usually made by burning the bones of other animals into charcoal. This black substance is used to draw eyebrows. As for the "nail polish" that is applied to the nails, it is Cellulose, which is made by soaking cotton in an acid. So, aren't you drawing your eyebrows with burnt bones and painting your nails with dissolved cotton?</p>

<p>— Pèi Yú</p>
<p>As long as you have a lot of strawberries, you don't need to buy rouge and lipstick, because strawberries are the most economical beauty product in summer, which is very helpful for women's beauty. If strawberries are used as summer beauty products, they will surely make the complexion rosy and delicate, and the skin white and tender. People will ask you, "What is your secret to beauty!"</p>
<p>If you like to eat them, you might as well eat as many strawberries as you can. Eating them will not only cleanse your mind and body, but also make you beautiful. You should know that only people suffering from eczema want to avoid strawberries. Oily skin can also be treated with strawberries. Just put a small amount of strawberries in a basin and crush them, soak a rag in the extracted juice. When using, wipe the skin with this rag soaked in strawberry juice. After half an hour, wash it off with a towel soaked in hot water with half a teaspoon of diluted benzoin tincture. This can transform the skin. When there are strawberries, you can prepare this solution and wipe it on the skin once a week, which will be effective.</p>
<p>If you have freckles or sunburned skin on your face, you don't need to spend a lot of money to buy freckle removal medicine or white powder. Just apply strawberry juice two or three times a day to eliminate them. This is not a secret freckle removal recipe for French beauties. If you are getting older and want to find a way to preserve your youthful appearance, then you should also cherish strawberries. History tells us that the famous beauty Madame Tallien often bathed in strawberries, putting 20 pounds of strawberries and 2 pounds of extracted raspberry juice in the bath water.</p>
<p>If you run out of nail polish to apply on your nails, don't be upset or panic. Just squeeze a strawberry on your nails, let the strawberry juice dry on your nails, and then gently rub the surface of your nails back and forth in your palm. This will make them shine, and the effect is no different from nail polish.</p>

<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education instructed all provincial secondary schools, stating that the budget standards for the recurring expenses of provincial secondary schools have been formulated and announced and have been followed for many years. In the next academic year, all secondary schools in the province will rigorously implement the integration of discipline and education. The salary standards for all full-time teachers have been separately formulated and announced. The budget standards for the recurring expenses of each school should also be revised. Now, in accordance with the provisions of laws and regulations, carefully reviewing the actual needs and referring to the province's financial capacity, the revised budget standards for provincial secondary schools in Jiangsu Province are hereby issued to all schools for compliance. It has also been found that in the past, each school often failed to fully comply with the regulations for the allocation of funds, and various expenses were arbitrarily misappropriated from time to time. In particular, exceeding the regulations on salary and repair, encroaching on public miscellaneous expenses, and reducing the efficiency of operations were common phenomena. After this revision of standards, the salaries and repair costs have been increased compared to before, which should alleviate the actual difficulties of each school. In the future, the allocation of funds must correct the previous malpractices, and each expense must strictly comply with the regulations and must not be encroached upon. The two items of salary and repair costs must not exceed the regulations. In addition to separate orders, a copy of the budget standards is hereby enclosed for the principal to comply with.</p>

President Luo of the university, with the intention of thoroughly reorganizing the school's affairs, advocates extreme strictness in this enrollment, preferring quality over quantity. In terms of curriculum, a thorough reorganization will be carried out, focusing on basic subjects to raise the students' level.

<p>Petition to the Ministry of Education for a Flexible Approach and Notice to Secondary School Students to Continue the Joint Examination. The Shanghai Secondary School Teachers' Association held its eighth executive committee meeting at its office yesterday morning at 9:00 AM. Liao Zhaojun, Wu Zhiqian Wu, Wu Baojin, Xu Zexiang, Shen Zuxing, Chen Shizhong, Wang Keming, and Chen Jicheng were present. Wu Zhiqian chaired the meeting, and Xu Zexiang served as the recorder. The agenda was as follows: (1) How to express opinions on the joint examination disputes in this city? Resolved: (1) Petition the Education Bureau to thoroughly investigate and severely punish (2) Petition the Ministry of Education to change the rule that students who fail one or two subjects cannot graduate, and to adopt a flexible approach. (3) Notify all secondary school students in the city to attend the continued joint examination on time. (2) Establishment of a Secondary School Student College Placement and Career Guidance Committee. Resolved: Shen Zuxing, Liao Zhaojun, Wu Zhiqian, Wang Keming, and Chen Shizhong were appointed as members, and Liao Zhaojun was responsible for convening the committee. (3) Seeking methods to introduce secondary school teachers. Resolved: Advertise to solicit registrations first. The Cultural Introduction Department will be responsible for drafting the regulations. (4) Establishment of a Cultural Services and Introduction Committee. Resolved: Tao Baichuan, Shen Tilan, Yuan Yeyu, Ma Jiazhen, Yao Chunxu, Zhang Pingjiang, Chen Xihua, Cui Jianwu, Hua Pingnan, Zhu Youhuan, Wu Wentao, Liao Shicheng, Zheng Xigu, Pan Yangyao, and Zhu Shaoping, and the executive directors of this association will be ex officio members. The Cultural Services and Introduction Department will handle this matter. (5) Invite Wu Xingya, Dong Renjian, and Liao Shicheng to give the next youth lecture. The content will include (1) a political report, (2) an academic lecture, and (3) entertainment, including dance, music, and other items. (6) The Shanghai Secondary School Teachers' Association will sponsor the Shanghai Summer Special Education Training Institute. Resolved: Passed. The Shanghai Secondary School Teachers' Association submitted a document to the Ministry of Education, stating: "Regarding the matter of submitting a petition: The joint examination system is intended to promote educational efficiency and improve cultural standards. The intention is good, and the law is excellent. Your ministry has already issued orders to the education departments and bureaus of all provinces and cities to comply and implement it. The joint examination for graduating students of primary and secondary schools in this city is also being handled by the city's Education Bureau. However, upon investigation of the graduation joint examination regulations promulgated by your ministry, there is a provision that students who fail one or two subjects in the joint examination must participate in the next joint examination and pass before they can advance to the next level of education. This association, which teaches in various schools in this city, is deeply aware that the curriculum standards of various schools, departments, and groups vary in quality, and the level of students in various subjects varies accordingly. Now, testing them with uniformly difficult test questions, so that they pass all subjects, is feared to be quite difficult. If one or two non-major subjects are not passed, they will be required to take remedial courses in school and participate in the next joint examination and pass before being allowed to advance to the next level of education. This would result in a loss of both time and money, which is probably not what the authorities desire. However, for the sake of the government's laws, it is difficult to allow such students to advance directly to the next level. This association cares about the future of young people and has repeatedly considered ways to provide relief. It is proposed that for the students in this city who are participating in the graduation joint examination this time (excluding major subjects), if one or two non-major subjects cannot be passed, those who wish to advance to the next level of education should be provisionally allowed to advance. They should be allowed to temporarily be special students in higher-level schools, and after they participate in the next graduation joint examination and pass, they will be converted to regular students. Those who wish to enter the workforce should be allowed to be given graduation diplomas by their original schools first, and after they participate in the next graduation joint examination and pass, the Education Bureau will issue a verified seal to make their graduation official. In this way, the future of the students will not be hindered, and the government's laws will also not be violated. For the sake of the future of teaching and learning, and for the sake of the proper use of students' time and money, this association respectfully offers its humble opinion, awaiting your approval and compliance. Respectfully submitted to the Ministry of Education." Also, the student unions of various secondary schools have also submitted documents separately petitioning the Ministry of Education and the Education Bureau. The content is roughly the same. The original text is omitted.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Secondary School Teachers' Association submitted a document to the Municipal Education Bureau requesting a thorough investigation and severe punishment of the staff members who leaked the examination questions, stating: "Regarding the matter of submitting a petition: The joint examination system is a major policy of the nation, intended to promote educational efficiency, select true talent, and improve cultural standards. Your bureau has meticulously planned this city's primary and secondary school graduation joint examination in accordance with the orders of the Ministry. Unfortunately, on the third day (17th) of the school's joint examination, the exam questions were leaked, causing suspicion and misunderstanding. A few people even advocated for a strike. This situation has a great impact on the implementation of the joint examination system and the future of graduating students. This association bears the responsibility of teaching and cannot bear to see the nation's major policy and your bureau's prestige damaged by this unfortunate incident. Nor does it wish for students taking the joint examination in the city to be disturbed by suspicion. In addition to earnestly advising all students participating in the joint examination to calmly await the authorities' thorough investigation and punishment of the staff members who leaked the examination questions, and to continue to take the remaining subjects to complete their studies, we respectfully submit this document to your bureau. A swift and thorough investigation should be conducted on the staff members involved in this joint examination to ensure that the person who leaked the examination questions is found and severely punished, so that the lawbreakers cannot escape their responsibility and to demonstrate the fairness of your bureau. The future of the joint examination is fortunate, and the future of education in this city is fortunate. Respectfully submitted to the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau, Shanghai Secondary School Teachers' Association."</p>

<p>Regarding participation in the joint examination, a letter from Shanghai Jianguo Middle School states: "To the esteemed newspaper: Yesterday, your newspaper published a news item regarding disputes arising during the secondary school joint examination, which stated, 'During this joint examination, some people discovered that Jianguo students submitted their test papers with more than twenty questions answered within ten minutes, causing suspicion.' Upon hearing this, we were extremely shocked. Upon investigation, the students in our school who participated in this joint examination know how to value themselves and would never be careless or seek to advance through luck. If submitting the paper early is grounds to accuse our school's students of leaking the examination questions, it would not only damage the personality of the students participating in the joint examination from our school, but also harm the reputation of our school. In addition to contacting the Daily News for clarification, we are writing this letter to request a prompt correction."</p>

<p>According to Lu Zhongen, the opposing teams in Donghua's six matches in the Philippines this time were "old wine in new bottles," meaning that although the team names changed, the players remained the same. These players, who will represent the Philippines at next year's Far Eastern Games, have already come together and been practicing for a long time, making plans for the future. This point should serve as a lesson for China's sports community, which tends to "cram at the last minute."</p>

The Philippine tennis champions, Leonard Gavia, and his doubles partner, Leodegario Pollntan, arrived in Shanghai with the Donghua football team yesterday morning at 10:30 AM. They will compete against the top Chinese and foreign players in this city and plan to go to Japan to prepare for next year's Far Eastern Games. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>One Pair of Youngsters: Gavia is only 18 years old and already holds the title of the Philippine tennis champion. The old guard has been replaced, and the young generation has risen. This is truly good news for the Philippine tennis community. His doubles partner, Palintai, is only 20 years old and has a promising future. The two passed through Hong Kong and performed with Hong Kong tennis giants Xiao Lunqiang and Xu Huipei. The results are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Record in Hong Kong: Gavia played against Hong Kong champion Xiao Lunqiang. In the two-set match, the Philippine player won the first set 6-4, and the Hong Kong player won the second set 7-5.

Palintai won both sets 6-3 and 6-3. In the doubles performance, the Philippine players played against the Xiao Lunqiang team, the eight-time Hong Kong champions. The result was 3-6 (Hong Kong wins) and 7-5 (Philippines wins). The Philippine players were tired from traveling by sea and did not get a chance to rest after arriving in Hong Kong. It is not easy to achieve these results.</p>

<p>Printing Affairs Section The Printing Affairs Section is responsible for handling the printing of all school publications, documents, and lecture notes. In the past, all printing was outsourced to printing houses. Not only were the prices expensive, but also the delivery of documents could often not be completed on time, which caused difficulties in handling affairs, and it was also very inconvenient to communicate and proofread. Therefore, a printing house was established during the summer vacation last year. The start-up cost was only 4,000 yuan. All machines, materials, trays, etc. were purchased as much as possible from domestic products. The printing house is divided into typesetting, machine, and binding departments. Each month, including labor, paper, materials, miscellaneous expenses, etc., only costs about 1,000 yuan. In addition to the lecture notes used in teaching (including mimeographing and typing), forms, test papers, publications, documents, forms, stationery, bound books, etc. used in administrative affairs, and the Nanyang intelligence of Nanyang Cultural Undertakings, Nanyang Research, and the paper used for collecting information, etc., and the publications of student organizations, etc., are all printed. In terms of employment, scientific management methods are adopted, and work value is calculated based on work efficiency, and domestic products are used as materials as much as possible to save expenses and promote domestic products.</p>
<p>Hygiene The school has always paid great attention to hygiene facilities. Since moving back to Zhenru after the war, the houses, medicines, and equipment have been rebuilt and added, and there have been many improvements, so the results are quite considerable. The main daily tasks are prevention and treatment. Prevention includes publicity, epidemic prevention injections, and physical examinations. In addition to the prescribed outpatient hours, there is also a resident doctor on campus to cope with the treatment of temporary emergency cases. In the past year, the added equipment includes sterilizers, distilled water makers, ophthalmology and surgery equipment, and inspection equipment, which are sufficient for application. The housing equipment includes an internal medicine room, a surgery room, an ophthalmology room, a pharmacy room, a waiting room, and an office. It is planned to build a school hospital when the school funds are sufficient, and provide medical treatment to the villagers near Zhenru to show sympathy for the poor people near the school.</p>

<h3 id="e257">"Sacrifice" <a href="#e257" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c257" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">257</a></h3>
<p>— Tao Fei</p>
<p>Business, it is said, is a matter of seeking profit from capital: "Thousands sell, ten thousands sell, but never at a loss," which can probably be said to be a motto in the business world. But now there are merchants who are willing to sacrifice, and those who are willing to sacrifice are everywhere. No matter on which street, or on which corner of the street, or on which newspaper, you can see stores there "sacrificing."</p>
<p>In foreign stores, price reductions are mostly used for seasons, festivals, or anniversaries. In addition, to reduce prices, even if it is to borrow a name, it always tends to say on the store's own side, such as promoting inventory or absorbing cash. They never thought of using the big topic of "sacrifice," which may be the stupidity of foreigners.</p>
<p>It seems that the Chinese are a nation willing to sacrifice, and at the same time, a nation willing to accept other people's sacrifices; otherwise, there would not be so many stores willing to "sacrifice," and the business of stores that "sacrifice" would not be so prosperous.</p>
<p>If you are an exception, that is, if you are a person who is unwilling or unbearable to accept other people's sacrifices, you will not enter the store with the sign "sacrifice" in front of the door, and you will feel indescribable when you see those two words. Isn't your disbelief in religion because you are embarrassed to use the blood shed by that religious leader as your admission ticket to heaven? Then, if you walk into a store selling sacrificial dishes, you will definitely lose your appetite. Because how can you bear to eat part of the store owner's life insurance savings, or a corner of the store owner's daughter's dowry preparation?</p>
<p>However, it doesn't matter if you don't go, because you are just an exception. As I have said, China is a nation willing to accept other people's sacrifices, and the sacrifice store will not be affected by your absence alone and fail to achieve its ambition. Don't you see that the stores willing to sacrifice are still increasing one by one?</p>
<p>Now there has been an expansion from "sacrifice" to "great sacrifice." I don't know how shocking and soul-stirring a step it will expand to in the future. If you are patient, you might as well wait and see.</p>
<h3 id="e258">Recollection <a href="#e258" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c258" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">258</a></h3>
<p>— Tang Tao</p>
<p>Since people have past events, they naturally have memories. Who can forget his past? We have all had a "youth." Successful people reminisce about the process of hard struggle, and those who have failed cannot be indifferent to past glory. Dragging the shadow of reality, everyone's mind hides another world, another person; this person is not like himself, but is clearly not someone else. We have also been winged by "happiness" when we were still in our mother's arms; no matter how poor the situation is, childhood is not malicious to us at all, relaxed, simple, sincere, and wonderful. This golden age of happiness is enough for us to recall.</p>
<p>Someone once said: "Clinging to the vestiges of the past is a cowardly thing." I think this is not a healthy sentence, but a comfort in certain situations; the past is not necessarily a deterrent to people, but often gives people stimulation and encouragement; which brave person has no memories? M Stanley Low said "Neither allmens efforts can efface or magnifythat being past." What we recall is only the real, indestructible or unchangeable past.</p>
<p>Memory is also the source of poets. Tennyson's in Memorium; Lamartine's Le Lec; Shakespeare's hundreds of Sonnets; and many short stories such as Cowper's His mothers Portrait, Shelly's The Past, etc. It may be a remembrance of old friends, or a love for lovers, or a cry for deceased relatives, lingering on the rise and fall of the family. They are saddened by the past, singing out the depression of their hearts. Whether it is joy, sorrow, gain or loss, their imagination is built on memories, and only in the soil of memories can the flowers of poets' blood and tears bloom.</p>
<p>We admire poets, and we are even more fascinated by the emotions in the poets' memories that make us sing and cry.</p>
<p>In addition, history gives us memories of the world. The rise and fall of a generation, the prosperity and decline of a country, CaosarAlexader, Napoleon Bonaparte Temujin, Kublai Khan's ambitions; from peace to war, and from war to stability; the memories of history are enough to give reality a contrast for reference.</p>
<p>We need memories. Use memories to promote our current situation, and use memories to determine our goals! The future is too vague, and reality becomes a relic in an instant. Only the past is forever imprinted on our minds.</p>
<p>Let us recall the universe, humanity, and ourselves.</p>
<h3 id="e259">Dissent from "Presentism" <a href="#e259" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c259" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">259</a></h3>
<p>— Di Yue</p>
<p>Mr. Lingjing wrote a section on "Presentism" in the Free Talk on June 15th. He believes that presentism is particularly developed in China now. I disagree with his opinion: According to his words, he believes that "presentism" aims at immediate satisfaction or victory, and is divided into two types: negative and positive: negative is "muddling along," and positive is "profit-only."</p>
<p>Except for a very few geniuses and ambitious people, there are few people who are not "muddling along" and "profit-only." It is an instinct to eat when you are hungry, so change is only a necessity and order in history. I think what deserves our attention most is how many presentists there are in China at present.</p>
<p>Farmers who have to spend several oceans of cost to plant one mu of land, regardless of whether it is a year of good harvest or famine, are not worthy of being a presentist. Young students with no meal tickets in their pockets are also not worthy of being a presentist.</p>
<p>Homeless vagrants are also not worthy of being presentists. Intellectuals who have not found patrons are naturally not considered presentists. Why are these all not considered presentists? Because they have no present; their present is not "muddling along," and if they want to seek profit, there is no profit not to seek, and presentists are mostly humans who can get by for a while and have profit to seek. At present, it is the heyday of "idealism" and expectationism.</p>
<p>It is not difficult to bury the presentist outlook on life, but it is more difficult to bury the idealistic and expectationist outlook on life.</p>
<h3 id="e260">Dropping Out of School <a href="#e260" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c260" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">260</a></h3>
<p>— Qiu Peng</p>
<p>Lili let go, pouted her little mouth, and turned her face away, "I won't be nice to you."</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>Lili didn't answer, just turned her face back and gave him a contemptuous glance, then picked up her books and left Qianqian; from her eyes, Qianqian recognized the sentence that the other classmates often ridiculed him with: "Stepchild! Carpenter's son!" He felt as if he had been stung by a bee, and lowered his head shyly.</p>
<p>Over there, there was already a big burst of laughter: "A star, hanging an oil bottle; the oil bottle slips, the carpenter repairs it" Qianqian raised his head, and many classmates focused their eyes on him, singing in unison. What made him most heartbroken was that even Lili, who used to be very nice to him, had now betrayed him and joined them to bully him! In his little heart, which was already full of sorrow, a kind of heartbroken juice like a broken love was added. He couldn't help crying sadly.</p>
<p>As he cried, the children surrounded him, clapping and laughing. Lili leaned against another classmate, deliberately tempting him with a piece of cake that the classmate gave her. He felt this was a different kind of shame and wanted to go tell the teacher right away, but experience told him that the result would be that he would be beaten up. He also wanted to hold back his tears and wipe them away with his black little hands, but he smeared his eye sockets all black, and the tears still kept falling down. He couldn't bear this humiliation and pain; finally, he cried out loudly and went back.</p>
<p>Crying back still has to be beaten by Mom. Qianqian stood blankly on the road thinking about waiting for his tears to dry. In the wheat fields in the distance, gusts of wheat fragrance blew in, and several cowherds who were grazing cattle on the mountain slopes and only cared about having fun themselves, some were sitting around under the shade of trees throwing stones, and some were swimming in a clear stream like small fish. Although these children all had a sad fate by birth just like Qianqian, they had such a pleasant and comfortable time together. Compared to himself, Qianqian couldn't help but feel envious. He ran home like a fly and threw his books on the ground angrily: "Mom, I don't want to study anymore. Tomorrow I'll go graze the cattle."</p>
<p>"What, you don't want to study?" The mother suddenly dropped the spinning wheel she was shaking: "Why?"</p>
<p>Qianqian bit his lip, didn't say the reason, just stubbornly said: "If I don't want to study, I just won't study!"</p>
<p>"Okay!" The mother sighed heavily: "You unteachable beast! Your father originally wanted you to be his apprentice several times, but because I thought his industry was hopeless and couldn't support the family in these years, I worked hard day and night spinning yarn, earning a few dollars for you to read a few books. I hope you will have a good harvest in the future, but who knows that you are such a useless weed!"</p>
<p>Qianqian watched his mother's tears falling straight down, and completely lost his mind.</p>

<p>Fishing Hook (Continued)</p>
<p>"Ah! At that time, I couldn't wait to kill him if I didn't love him so much. Isn't this a prank, this little fishing hook! I thought he was fishing me to heaven."</p>
<p>Girl Ellesdin suggested throwing him far away, at the end of the garden, burying him in a hole, and then tamping the soil covering him with her feet.</p>
<p>"Ah! I won't!" Brother Felix said, "I want to keep it. I want to use it to fish. Ah, a fishing hook stained with Mom's blood, this is a good fishing hook! I want to use it to hook many fish out, as fat as thighs!" So he shook the carrot whiskers. The carrot whiskers were still stunned because they had not been punished. He was still excessively remorseful, and his throat was still making sighing sounds. He was washing his ugly face that deserved to be beaten in a large bucket of water.</p>
<p>Silver Coin (1)</p>
<p>Le Pique, have you lost anything, Carrot Whiskers? Carrot Whiskers hasn't, Mom.</p>
<p>Le Pique, you don't even know, why did you immediately say you haven't? Flip your pockets first.</p>
<p>Carrot Whiskers (He turned out the lining of his pockets, and he looked at them hanging outside like donkey ears.) Ah, yes, Mom, please give it back to me.</p>
<p>Le Pique, give what back to me? Did you lose anything? I asked you casually, but I guessed what you lost?</p>
<p>Carrot Whiskers, I don't know.</p>
<p>Le Pique, be careful you're going to lie. You're already darting around like a careless silver fish. Answer slowly. What exactly did you lose? Is it your top?</p>
<p>Carrot Whiskers, that's right. I couldn't even remember. I lost my top, that's right, Mom.</p>
<p>Le Pique, no, Mom. You didn't lose your top. Your top was confiscated by me last week.</p>
<p>Carrot Whiskers, then, I lost my knife.</p>
<p>Le Pique, what knife? Who gave you a knife?</p>
<p>Carrot Whiskers, no one gave me a knife.</p>
<p>Le Pique, my poor child, I can't get rid of you in my life. People will definitely say I've driven you crazy. But there are only two of us now. I'm asking you gently. A child who loves his mother should tell his mother everything. I dare say you must have lost your silver coin. I didn't know anything about this, but I believe I must have guessed right. Don't deny it. Your nose is moving.</p>
<p>Carrot Whiskers, Mom, this coin is mine. My godfather gave it to me on Sunday. I lost it; consider myself unlucky. This is a terrible thing, but I can comfort myself. And I'm not very concerned about this either. One more coin or one less coin.</p>
<p>Le Pique, see, you chattering thing, I'm listening to you honestly. In this way, do you take the money that your godfather worked so hard to earn so lightly? He loves you so much that he will be very angry if he knows about this. Carrot Whiskers, Mom, as if I have spent my money casually. Do I have to save it for a lifetime?</p>
<p>Le Pique, shut up! You shouldn't have lost it, nor should you have squandered it without an adult's permission. You don't have this coin now; find a way to make it up, find it, make one, whatever you want. Get out, don't talk nonsense here anymore. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e262">Reviving the Rural Economy with the Cotton and Wheat Loan <a href="#e262" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c262" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">262</a></h3>
<p>Those who understand the reality of China's financial situation today also know that this 50 million US dollar cotton and wheat loan is inevitable and nothing to be surprised about. After years of internal warfare, compounded by natural disasters, the government's revenues and expenditures have become strained. Adding to this is the global economic panic, whose repercussions have led to the decline of all industries. Furthermore, there is foreign aggression still being resisted, and the suppression of bandits remains unfinished. The urgent need for funds is thus inevitable. Considering that domestic public bonds have fallen to 30-40% of their face value, even if more are issued, in a generally economically depleted China, few would pay attention. At the same time, the United States, a gold standard nation, has a surplus of both capital and raw materials. This is truly a match made in heaven, and thus the cotton and wheat loan has been successfully secured.</p>
<p>However, there is something we cannot refrain from saying: how much of the 50 million loan will the government actually receive? And what will be its impact on the livelihoods of the people? As reported in the newspapers, at the very beginning when the cotton and wheat goods are released from the warehouse, 10% of the cost must be paid back from the loan itself. Within 90 days, another 15% must be paid. In other words, even before the goods arrive in China, the 50 million loan effectively amounts to only 75%, which is 37,500,000 US dollars. Adding to this the shipping costs from the US to China and all miscellaneous expenses, assuming these to be 15%, then only 60% remains, which is only 30,000,000 US dollars. Recent reports state that Shanghai's yarn factories plan to purchase at 80% of the original price. Thus, taking the cotton and wheat worth 37,500,000 US dollars and selling it at 80%, only 30,000,000 US dollars remain. Deducting the shipping costs of 7,500,000 US dollars, only 22,500,000 US dollars remain. This does not include commissions or other inevitable expenses. This rough calculation may or may not be accurate. The repayment amount is still 50 million dollars. Furthermore, considering an annual interest rate of 5% over three years, this adds another 750,000. Comparing this with the actual amount received, the interest on this loan is indeed quite high. However, compared to previously issued public bonds, it is much more favorable. What we do not understand, however, is that the Rural Revitalization Committee's echoes have not yet faded, and yet this loan has already been secured. What will be its impact on China's rural areas?</p>
<p>The reasons for this loan are, first, to alleviate the raw material panic in cotton yarn, and second, to alleviate the food shortage in rural areas. At first glance, it seems as if this loan is, as some magnates have said, entirely based on the government's deep concern for the people. Cotton and wheat will each be used for their respective purposes, and without this, good governance cannot be spoken of. However, before the cotton and wheat loan was announced, even if we are forgetful, we should still remember the issue of yarn factories reducing work hours, which was a hot topic, no less so than the heated discussion of the loan issue today. The reason given by the yarn factories for reducing work hours was that foreign cotton was squeezing them out, sales were slow, and they had no choice but to do so. Now, however, it has changed to say that yarn factories are lacking raw materials, a crisis is arising, and the success of the cotton and wheat loan offers hope for recovery. How can this be? Is it due to effective "public opinion guidance," making this news truthful and credible?</p>
<p>Let's leave this aside for now and just talk about using the wheat to provide food for the people. Our country's farmers are extremely impoverished. In North China, for example, small farmers rarely eat white flour throughout the year. Even when eating inferior grains such as sorghum, they do so sparingly, trying to conserve as much as possible. Among ten households, those who are able to eat their fill often account for only seven or eight. This is truly China's current crisis, the source of all evils. The convening of the Rural Revitalization Committee was also intended for this purpose. Therefore, borrowing wheat to help with food is a matter of utmost urgency.</p>
<p>However, this is said by those who do not understand the situation. The reason why our farmers cannot eat their fill is not because of a shortage of food production. Tenant farmers everywhere often have to contribute more than half of their total harvest to the landlords. Although self-cultivating farmers do not bear the burden of land rent, they are still subject to the exploitation of excessive taxes and levies, which are unbearable. Coupled with financial depletion and the rampant spread of usury, before the crops are even planted, most of them have already been devoured by usurers under the guise of "selling green seedlings" and "advance sales." After the harvest, the rice is abundant, but after the producers pay rent, taxes, and debts, they have nothing left for themselves. The lack of food for the people is largely due to this. Therefore, I dare to say that the crux of the grain problem in our country today is less due to insufficient production and more due to unequal distribution.</p>
<p>This is the second time for the American wheat loan. We cannot forget the painful results of last year's loan. Although various places reported good harvests, because the wheat loan had a contract beforehand, imports continued as usual, leading to a daily drop in grain prices. Farmers initially thought that the unprecedented abundant harvest would allow them to be well-fed for a day, but who knew that it would turn out to be insufficient, with huge losses in costs. Some became refugees, and some even starved to death. Rice rotted in the fields, and rice riots were seen everywhere. Who was responsible for this? Who caused this? Today, borrowing money to enrich the people with food – even a child of three feet would not believe it.</p>
<p>Cotton and wheat are major agricultural products in our country. Even if we say that supply and demand are still insufficient, this is because cultivation is not suitable, the land is not fully utilized, and the social system is flawed, leading to this situation. The main reason for this is foreign imports. The exclusion of foreign cotton and wheat is indeed what has caused this. The former Ministry of Finance convened a national food conference and had a proposal that the dumping of foreign rice, which flooded the market, had a profound impact on the rural economy. In order to rectify the source and rescue agriculture, the only solution was to impose import duties on foreign rice to show restriction. For a time, the talk of imposing import duties on foreign rice was again rampant. Now, according to the report on the 13th, the imposition of this tax will be postponed again. Therefore, regardless of whether it is related to the establishment of the cotton and wheat loan, such words and deeds are infuriating. How can they not know that, following the old example of last year's American wheat, the government will inevitably sell the borrowed cotton and wheat at a suppressed price in order to obtain cash? This also contradicts the dumping tax that the Ministry of Industry and Commerce claims will be implemented soon. All of these things are truly confusing to us.</p>
<p>According to a Central News Agency dispatch from Nanjing on the 14th, Director Wang told reporters that, in terms of content, both cotton and wheat are imported in large quantities from foreign countries every year, especially from the United States, as proven by customs statistics. Therefore, this loan will definitely not have the effect of causing stagnation in our country's agricultural products. This is indeed true. Even if the government does not borrow, American cotton and wheat will still be imported as usual. The dumping of Australian wheat is considered a major problem, but a few days ago, three ships of 25,000 tons of wheat from Argentina in South America were dumped and imported. Today, the government's borrowing will only make foreign cotton and wheat more powerful, more profitable, and more quickly dumped into our country's market. As for the so-called not harming agricultural products, they have already been harmed before, and they are still being harmed now, only to a different degree. Do they not know that the decline of Chinese agriculture is largely due to the manipulation and dumping by foreign merchants? Weeds are not removed, and good crops do not grow. The dumping of imported agricultural products and the revival of Chinese agriculture cannot coexist. If this loan does not harm agricultural products, then Chinese agriculture will not decline, the countryside does not need to be rescued, and the convening of the Rural Revitalization Committee is unnecessary.</p>
<h3 id="e263">The 50 Million US Dollar Loan and China's Cotton Textile Industry by Qian Guan-yi <a href="#e263" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c263" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">263</a></h3>
<p>In the past month or two, Chinese yarn factories have been forced to reduce working hours and suspend operations due to sluggish market prices and operating losses, petitioning for relief, which has become a serious problem for the government and society. And recently, the success of a large 50 million US dollar loan, specifically for purchasing American cotton and wheat, has shocked the general public even more. However, if this 200 million yuan is used entirely to purchase American cotton, it would only yield about 1 million bales! In the past two or three years, the import of foreign cotton into China has exceeded 1 million bales. The annual loss to the country from this, including cotton products, is actually many times more than 200 million yuan. Therefore, if we view this 50 million US dollar loan as a major problem, why not study everything about China's cotton textile industry? We should know that there are problems greater than this. Among China's modern industries, none has a longer history, a larger scale, more employees, or is more related to the national economy and people's livelihood than the textile industry. However, its many shortcomings and great difficulties, such as the lack of government protection, unfortunate environmental conditions, weak competitiveness, and uncertain future, have a greater impact on the national economy and people's livelihood than any other industry. Here, I will discuss its shortcomings and difficulties.</p>
<p>(1) Why do we say that the state does not provide protection? State protection of industry has always been proclaimed by successive governments, but in reality, not only is there no such thing, but sometimes it is done in the opposite way. Protecting domestic industry necessarily requires levying protective tariffs, but not long ago, cotton goods still had the so-called "reciprocal tariff agreement," which granted them the lowest tax rate, allowing Japanese cotton goods to be imported. At the same time, other countries also followed suit to obtain the most favored treatment. It was only recently that this agreement expired. Not only that, but according to unequal treaties, there are foreign-owned factories within China that are completely unbound by Chinese law. The most powerful of these factories are the Japanese textile industries in China, which almost have the momentum to usurp the host's position. Chinese-owned textile factories have made considerable progress in the past ten years or so through struggle and hardship. However, because the state's politics are not on track, factory operations often suffer various unexpected losses, while foreign businesses are uniquely unaffected by the political situation. This is already an advantage over Chinese businesses. Yet, the government not only does not grant preferential treatment to Chinese yarn factories compared to foreign yarn factories, but oppresses them instead. For example, the yarn consolidated tax, where the tax on fine yarn is lower while the tax on coarse yarn is higher, is in effect favoring Japanese factories. This is one example. Furthermore, Chinese factories have various obligations to the government, while foreign factories rely on their protections and fulfill none. Chinese factories bear various social responsibilities, while foreign factories ignore them altogether. Chinese factories have certain restrictions on workers, while foreign factories can do whatever they want. All of these unfair things are not found in other industries, so we say that the state does not provide protection, and there is no other industry like this. (2) Why do we say that environmental conditions are unfortunate? Resisting Japanese goods is a common psychology shared by all Chinese with even a little knowledge. On the surface, it seems that resisting Japanese goods has no effect at all, but it is not so. In reality, it has indeed been resisted to the point of extinction, which even children would not believe. Especially in the cotton goods industry, if we go to the shops that sell cotton cloth by the bolt and examine the various types of cloth, apart from a portion that is genuine Western goods, the rest are entirely domestic products. Examining these domestic cloths closely, they are labeled as being woven by a certain factory in a certain place. We naturally believe that these "certain factories in certain places" are owned and operated by Chinese. Their company names and trademarks have been registered with the government, and their products are also boldly labeled "Approved by the Ministry of Finance, taxed as machine-made foreign goods, no further taxes will be levied." Such genuine domestic products should naturally be welcomed by those who love domestic goods. If someone were to point out that this is not a domestic product, someone would surely spit in their face and accuse them of slander. Who knew that most of these are still Japanese goods? Other Japanese goods can be disguised as domestic goods, but there may still be some points of identification. However, cotton yarn and cloth, once their appearance is changed or they undergo dyeing and finishing, are not easily distinguished. Cunning merchants take advantage of this point to practice their cunning, deceive the world, and seek profit. Society even praises them, saying that they are able to manage domestic goods. We have no name for such domestic goods, so we call them "fake domestic goods." Because these "fake domestic goods" are welcomed by the Chinese, Japanese-made cotton yarn and cloth can still be sold without hindrance, even during the period of resistance. Moreover, because Japanese products are slightly better in quality than genuine domestic products, "fake domestic goods" are easier to promote than genuine domestic goods. Also, because Japanese products are outwardly resisted by the Chinese, their selling price is lower than before, the cost of operating "fake domestic goods" is lighter than genuine domestic goods, the profit is huge, many flock to it, and genuine domestic goods are even less considered. In the past, when there was no resistance, genuine domestic goods were cheaper than Japanese goods, and there was still a portion of genuine patriots who welcomed them and allowed them to develop. Since the resistance, not only have Chinese factories not benefited from the resistance, but genuine domestic goods have also been defeated by "fake domestic goods" and cannot survive. This kind of inconceivable fact cannot be understood by society. Therefore, we say that the unfortunate environmental conditions are no greater than in this industry. (3) Why do we say that inherent competitiveness is weak? The biggest obstacle to China's textile industry at present is the Japanese yarn factories in the country. Most of these Japanese businesses are branch setups of large companies in Japan or are established by famous financial groups. The capital is huge and the power is great, which Chinese factories can never match. Japanese factories have government protection above them and bank backing outside them. Internally, their technology and engineering are superior. We, on the other hand, are inferior in every aspect. The British claim to be the country of cotton spinning, but the world market has still been taken by the Japanese. How can we defend ourselves when the great thieves are already inside the house? Furthermore, Japanese companies move with coordinated steps, while we have scattered opinions. Other small industries can be operated successfully by one or two steadfast individuals. However, the textile industry is large-scale. Unexpectedly, the state, society, environment, and human resources are not allowed to be consolidated and changed. The difference in strength between Chinese and foreign factories is even greater. Therefore, inherent competitiveness is weak, and there is no other industry like this.</p>
<p>(4) Why do we say that the future lacks prospects? Although the Sino-Japanese reciprocal tariff agreement has expired, the Japanese are currently protesting, even if it is ineffective. In order to avoid increased tariffs on imports into our country, the Japanese will inevitably set up more factories in our country. It has long been rumored that Japanese factories are expanding on a large scale in Shanghai and Qingdao. It will not be difficult to prove this with facts in a year or two. At that time, the pressure on Chinese factories from Japanese factories will be even greater. The government is like this, the people are like this, and the various things that were inferior to others in the past may not necessarily be improved in the near future. The loss of the four northeastern provinces will reduce the sales market. Not only has the output of domestic raw cotton not increased, but its quality has also deteriorated. Therefore, we cannot rely on the weather or the land. Recently, the various factories have reduced working hours and petitioned for relief, and the government has no solution, which makes people even more angry. If the textile industry cannot gain a foothold and gradually declines, then the national and social situation will truly be even more unimaginable. Therefore, we say that the uncertain future prospects and their impact on the national economy and people's livelihood are no greater than in this industry.</p>
<p>So, does China's textile industry have no way out? Alas, what are you saying? The reporter is not clever and does not want to imitate what people are doing now, making grand plans. But please let the Chinese people clearly recognize this situation, from now on unite together, for self-extraction, remove its obstacles, seek the reasons for being inferior to others, and the so-called way out is already here.</p>
<p>Now, let us go on to say a word about the large 50 million US dollar loan. This loan is a multifaceted problem with complex interests. Because its content and methods have not been announced, we can only make abstract discussions at this time.</p>
<p>(1) American cotton has already been adopted by our textile factories, and there is a lot of it. Currently, there is a real lack of domestic raw cotton. Being able to use low-interest loans to import it is certainly what manufacturers desire.</p>
<p>(2) The government using huge funds to engage in beneficial construction and profitable industries during the three-year loan period is of course what the people hope for.</p>
<p>(3) If the government does not use it well and continues to use it for political consumption, then after three years, when the principal and interest are repaid, cash will have to flow out of the country.</p>
<p>(4) Domestic agricultural products will be suppressed by this huge amount of cotton and wheat, and prices will inevitably fall even lower. The rural economy, which is already withering, will inevitably feel even more desolate.</p>
<p>According to the first point, manufacturers can currently get a temporary respite, but it is only temporary and not a fundamental solution. According to the second point, it is a hope with no certainty, and dangerous elements account for the majority. According to the third point, it is a political crime and a huge leak for the country. According to the fourth point, it is a major disaster for the country and society. We can estimate the benefits and drawbacks of this loan from these points.</p>
<h3 id="e264">Discussing the American Wheat Loan from the Perspective of Flour and Wheat Production and Sales by Xie E <a href="#e264" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c264" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">264</a></h3>
<p>(1) The Process of the Second American Wheat Loan: The proposal for the second American wheat loan was made more than a year ago. It was because of the floods in the Jiang, Han, and Huai rivers in the 20th year of the Republic of China [1931], which displaced tens of millions of refugees, that there was a consensus to borrow 450,000 tons of American wheat. After this American wheat (which included about 20% flour) was shipped to China, in addition to distributing a portion of the wheat and flour to the disaster areas in various provinces, the rest was sold to flour factories at reduced prices to obtain cash. Last year, it was widely rumored that under the mediation of the American advisor Mr. Young, there would be a second American wheat loan, with the same quantity as the first, 450,000 tons. After this news was spread, all parties unanimously opposed it, because at that time (autumn of the 21st year of the Republic of China [1932]), the domestic rice harvest was abundant and grain prices were low. Grain prices in Hunan Province plummeted to about two yuan, and the rice and miscellaneous grains in other producing areas continued to fall sharply. The rural economy had reached the point of bankruptcy, and there was still a lot of the first disaster relief wheat left scattered in various remote areas. Furthermore, there were endless reports of cases arising from the distribution and sale of disaster relief wheat for cash. This move was immediately halted informally, but the authorities seemed to have never forgotten about it. Before Minister Song went abroad this time, there were rumors in the market that the American wheat loan would be brought up again. And that it was likely to become a reality. Now it has indeed been signed when the new wheat is on the market.</p>
<p>(2) Rumors of the Quantity of Wheat Purchased with the Loan: According to reports, this loan is for a total of 50 million US dollars, equivalent to 200 million national currency. Four-fifths will be used to purchase cotton, and one-fifth will be used to purchase wheat, with the total value of wheat being 40 million national currency. However, the official contract has not yet been announced, so the price may be high or low, and the quantity may be large or small. According to manufacturers' sources, there will be 12 million bushels of wheat (360,000 tons), with the wheat price set at 5.25 yuan per dan, plus 4 million bags of flour, making a round number. Grain merchants, however, said that there will be 480,000 tons of wheat, with the same price, plus 800,000 bags of flour. Another theory is still the same as the number of the first loan, namely 450,000 tons. It is also rumored that it has not been purchased yet, and will be bought and sold according to market prices later. All of the above theories are difficult to verify. However, it is undoubtedly true that flour will be included.</p>
<p>(3) Market Prices After the American Wheat Loan is Approved: This year's domestic wheat harvest has already become a reality, and new wheat is being harvested in large quantities everywhere. Suddenly, this huge amount of foreign wheat has been transacted, which is no different from a bolt from the blue. American farmers are happy to hear about it, while Chinese farmers are swallowing their tears. Merchants are wary when they hear about it and dare not transport it. Factories are watching and waiting, suspending shipments. Speculators see an opportunity to take advantage of and engage in large-scale disruptions. The price of flour and wheat is like a torrent rushing straight down. Recently, it was heard that the price of wheat in Pudong Zhongguan has fallen to two yuan per dan locally, even in areas with high-quality products. The situation in the rural areas can be imagined. The following is a list of flour and wheat market prices since the Republic of China, which shows the impact of this loan.</p>
<p>| Year | Average Price | Highest | Lowest | Year | Average Price | Highest | Lowest |</p>
<p>|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|</p>
<p>| Year 1 Wheat | 4.32 | 4.65 | 4.0 | Year 17 Wheat | 5.73 | 6.35 | 4.79 |</p>
<p>| Flour | 2.08 | 2.24 | 1.86 | Flour | 3.06 | 3.31 | 2.83 |</p>
<p>| Year 10 Wheat | 4.85 | 5.42 | 5.91 | Year 18 Wheat | 5.87 | 6.26 | 5.34 |</p>

<p>| Flour | 2.51 | 3.27 | 2.57 | Flour | 3.37 | 3.60 | 2.94 |</p>
<p>| Year 14 Wheat | 5.76 | 6.35 | 5.11 | Year 20 Wheat | 5.25 | 5.83 | 4.54 |</p>

<p>| Year 15 Wheat |  |  | 6. | Year 21 Wheat |  |  | 5.55 | 4.35 |</p>
<p>| Flour | 3.24 | 3.40 | 2.99 | Flour | 2.81 | 2.97 | 2.57 |</p>
<p>| Year 16 Wheat | 6.22 | 6.68 | 5.84 | Year 22 June Half Wheat |  |  | 5.21 | 4.00 |</p>
<p>| Flour | 3.22 | 3.51 | 2.9 |  Flour |  |  | 2.85 | 2.37 |</p>
<p>(4) Statistics on Domestic Wheat Production and Sales: Statistics in China's agricultural and commercial sectors do not pay attention, and it is difficult to be accurate. Collect information from all parties and list it in the chapter to show the situation.</p>
<p>National Wheat Production</p>
<p>| Year | Production Amount (Dan) |</p>
<p>|---|---|</p>
<p>| Year 3 of the Republic of China | 265,826,13  |</p>
<p>| Year 4 | 115,371,240 |</p>
<p>| Year 5 | 358,385,15 |</p>
<p>| Year 6 | 216,249,778 |</p>
<p>| Average of the above four years | 238,964,787 |</p>
<p>| Average of the most recent four years from Year 18 to 21 | 423,374,61 |</p>
<p>The production figures in the table above are still close to the actual situation, because in recent years, soldiers, bandits, and disasters have been incessant. Furthermore, there has been a change to planting cotton, tobacco, and opium. For example, Sichuan Province used to export a lot of rice and wheat in the past, but recently it has been buying from other provinces. This is clear evidence. At least one-third of the production is supplied to local folk mills for needs, and there is still a need for winemaking and other food products. Therefore, only a little more than half is supplied to flour factories.</p>
<p>National Wheat Consumption of Flour Factories (Unit: Dan)</p>
<p>| Location | Daily Night Wheat Consumption | Annual (300 days) |</p>
<p>|---|---|---|</p>
<p>| 18 Flour Factories in Shanghai | 60,250 | 18,075,000 |</p>
<p>| 22 Factories in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Inland | 36,250 | 10,875,000 |</p>
<p>| 35 Factories in Other Locations | 55,100 | 16,530,000 |</p>
<p>| 27 Factories in the Three Northeastern Provinces | 86,500 | 35,950,000 |</p>
<p>| Total 102 Factories | 238,100 | 75,430,000 |</p>
<p>The above factories were all surveyed in the spring of this year, but one small factory in Shanghai has closed, and two factories in the inland are difficult to recover. The details of other locations are unknown. Only half of the factories in the Northeast can resume work after the new wheat is released. The amount refers to the maximum amount they need. In reality, it is reduced by at least 10%. If we consider the current situation, flour sales, and the economic panic, only 70-80% of it is needed. Due to the decrease in domestic wheat production in recent years, the factories near the coast have sometimes relied on foreign wheat to supplement their needs. In recent years, there has been a huge amount, often ranking in the top two among imported foreign goods, which is alarming.</p>
<p>Table of Flour and Wheat Import Values (Unit: Customs Gold)</p>
<p>| Year | Exports | Imports |</p>
<p>|---|---|---|</p>
<p>| Year 1 of the Republic of China Wheat | 427,921 | 8,127,542 |</p>
<p>| Flour | 226,196 | 8,126,938 |</p>
<p>| Year 9 Wheat | 2,561,469 | 572,752 |</p>
<p>| Flour | 1,825,172 | 2,233,021 |</p>
<p>| Year 18 Wheat | 3,051,409 | 2,143,078 |</p>
<p>| Flour | 1,258,086 | 2,903,863 |</p>

<p>|  |  | 5,055,307 |</p>
<p>During the late Qing and early Xuan period, the ban on wheat exports was lifted. Before the 11th year of the Republic of China [1922], our country had a huge amount of flour and wheat exports, and wheat was often in a surplus position. This year's wheat harvest is better than in previous years. According to manufacturers' estimates, it can meet the needs of various flour factories for eight months, but the shortfall for four months still has to depend on foreign wheat.</p>
<p>(5) The Attitude of Manufacturers Towards the Wheat Loan: Based on the above, even if American wheat comes to China, it will not hinder the work. Insiders have said that 300,000 to 400,000 tons of American wheat is only enough for the use of certain factories for half a year, not to mention the others. Some also say that if there is a drought in the United States this year, the wheat harvest will be poor. In addition, now that the alcohol ban has been lifted, the demand for wheat is greater, so the pre-scheduled American wheat is also appropriate. However, because this wheat loan was established at the time when the domestic new wheat was being harvested, merchants were hesitant to move forward, manufacturers were watching and waiting, and the market suddenly became soft, so the price of wheat plummeted, and farmers sighed, which is the opposite of the American farmers' joy upon hearing the loan was approved. Merchants of flour and wheat in this city only requested that the shipment be delayed by six months so that domestic wheat would have the opportunity to be sold and not be squeezed out. The opposition to including flour in the wheat loan was more resolute. It was believed that it would seize the sales of domestic flour, which may result in affecting the livelihoods of workers, so a telegram was sent to the authorities requesting that only wheat be borrowed and not mixed with American flour.</p>
<h3 id="e265">On the Matter of the US Cotton Loan <a href="#e265" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c265" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">265</a></h3>
<p>Since this newspaper reported that Mr. Jones, the Director-General of the U.S. Federal Finance Adjustment Agency, declared: "He has agreed to lend US$50 million to the Chinese government for the purchase of wheat, cotton, and flour. It is planned that four-fifths of the US$50 million loan will be used to purchase cotton, and the remainder will be used to purchase flour and wheat, with an estimated yield of 900,000 bales of cotton and 12 million bushels of wheat." Both the U.S. authorities and the Chinese government and people have celebrated this in unison, believing that on the one hand, the U.S. surplus stock will be sold off, thereby increasing prices, and on the other hand, given China's current economic situation, there is an urgent need for this large quantity of cotton and wheat, which is a win-win situation. However, in my personal observation, this U.S. cotton loan will do more harm than good to China's cotton industry. I will elaborate as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Impact on Cotton Farmers and Merchants: With foreign cotton flooding the market, Chinese cotton is bound to fall in price. When cotton prices fall, cotton farmers will not be able to make a profit, leading to reduced planting and unemployment. And cotton peddlers, cotton merchants, cotton transport merchants, cotton storage merchants, as well as cotton ginning workers, and cotton batting workers, who depend on cotton planting for their livelihood, will all be indirectly and significantly affected. (2) Impact on Domestic Yarn Mill Operators: Some argue that the government has sold U.S. cotton to Chinese yarn mills at an 80% discount for the purpose of purchasing U.S. cotton. I believe this is far from the truth: First, China relies on about 3 million dan of U.S. cotton annually, which is usually sufficient for two years of consumption by domestic yarn mills. Last year, the quantity imported by China exceeded 3 million dan, of which only half was consumed by Chinese yarn mills, and the remainder was consumed by foreign mills in China. Now, with a one-time order, the turnover in supply and demand will be inflexible, inevitably leading to hoarding and waste. Second, inland yarn mills in China do not need U.S. cotton in the first place. Now, because U.S. cotton is cheap, they will be tempted to compete for it, leading to a situation of overstocking and hoarding of domestic cotton. Third, even if, as reported, U.S. cotton is ordered and shipped to China in batches of 50,000 bales per month, it will still not be enough to meet the needs of the country for two years. In fact, it is impossible to prevent other countries from ordering U.S. cotton. Therefore, the supply and demand situation in the domestic market will be uneven, and the surge and fall of market prices is to be expected.</p>
<p>(3) Impact on the Domestic Cotton Market: Last year, the domestic cotton market situation was low due to the bumper harvest of domestic cotton and the drastic fall in U.S. cotton prices. Fortunately, domestic yarn mills had a great need for cotton, and cotton prices remained constant between thirty-two and three taels. This year, domestic yarn mills are operating poorly. Once a large batch of U.S. cotton is imported, it will easily lead to an imbalance between supply and demand, which will greatly affect the rise and fall of cotton prices.</p>
<p>In summary, this U.S. cotton loan has had many adverse effects on China's cotton industry. It is obvious to all! Instead of spending this tens of millions of dollars of U.S. cotton loan on useless things, it would be better to use it as cotton capital, specifically for the development and promotion of China's cotton planting industry, so that cotton-producing areas can be promoted, cotton production can be increased, and it can adequately meet the needs of domestic yarn mills. Then, cotton farmers and merchants who have long been trapped in the rural economic crisis may be able to recover.</p>

<h3 id="e267">Securities The Bond Market Last Week Fluctuated Entirely Based on Chips <a href="#e267" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c267" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">267</a></h3>
<p>Monday Was the Most Active, The Rest of the Days Were Dull</p>
<p>Last week, from June 12th to 17th, the public bond market of the Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange went through a week. Only Monday was the situation the best. The rest were ordinary and unremarkable. The latter half of the week was even more dull and lifeless. The most frequent and vigorous rise and fall during the week was only for the whole sixth type. The only one that was always cold and the transaction was hurried was 96. The reasons for the rise and fall during the week were all related to chips except for Monday. Therefore, the future trend may temporarily deviate from the environment, and only the supply and demand of chips will be the standard for the rise and fall. It is estimated that the number of existing accounts is quite large. Among them, there are indeed people who submit spot goods and have sufficient strength to prepare for receiving goods. However, there must be many floating longs and shorts. Therefore, there will definitely be a lively competition of strength in the future. Now, I will briefly describe the past week. On Monday, because Feng Jun lived in Chahar, the situation gradually changed from complicated to simple. The solution should not be too far away. All financial circles tried their best to collect. The sixth type even reached the limit board. Other types also rose by several jiao to two or three yuan. Of the whole week, this day was the most energetic, and the market was also extremely active, with a maximum price of 128. Combined with the discount, the least was also close to 60%. Compared with before 918, the actual price was equal in terms of interest and the amount of repayment. On Tuesday, there was a slight rebound, falling slightly by two or three jiao to seven or eight jiao. After a period of frenzy, it gradually subsided. From Wednesday onwards, the trend gradually entered the path of hovering. The smaller the hovering range, the more compact it became. The last day of the week was surprisingly dull. The amount of rise and fall was only three or five jiao. Looking at the results, the prices rose uniformly, from several jiao to more than one yuan. However, the whole sixth rose the most by three yuan and three or four jiao. Because the transaction department of the goods exchange was merged with the securities department, the transaction was more than before, with a total of 73.0465 million yuan. Among them, spot transactions amounted to 61,500 yuan. The futures with the most transactions were the unified salt tax, with a total of 17.25 million yuan. Disarmament accounted for 10.38 million yuan. The customs duty of 1920 accounted for 9.14 million yuan. The customs duty of 22 rolls accounted for 13.81 million yuan. Demobilization accounted for 3.46 million yuan. The transaction of 96 was 4.04 million yuan. The rest were only several hundred thousand yuan.</p>

<p>Yesterday, US cotton fell due to weak news from Liverpool, Southern short selling, and closing of long positions. As a result, spot goods fell by 20 pounds, and futures fell by 15 pounds to 17 pounds. In the Liverpool cotton market, spot goods rose by one point, and futures fell by four or five points. Egyptian cotton spot goods rose by one point. In the Bombay cotton market, the market was initially firm following US cotton, but then fell due to closing of long positions. Finally, the market recovered due to short covering. As a result, Omra fell by one rupee, and Pingle and Balo Creek both fell by half a rupee.

<p>(South of Shanghai) Yesterday, the source was No. 50 to 60, and the way out to this street was still weak and sluggish. However, the situation in the later market was slightly better. The opening price of Changbang, Sutongbang, and Nangang varieties fell by several points to more than a jiao. The sales market for Tianjin Weihaiwei and other guest varieties was initially sluggish, but it showed a little vitality until near noon. The stomach capacity still had more than 2,000 packages. The buyer side still wanted to cut prices, but the seller was entrusted by inland merchants to limit prices, so they were unwilling to sell easily. The thin rice and high-quality materials such as Qingjiao Sixin slightly increased by a few points, only the medium and secondary grades remained flat. The stomach capacity for Du Bojian was not large, and the price also weakened by 5 cents. The price of Bianyuan was lower by a jiao due to the seller's price cut and sale. Yinyuan was lacking.</p>

The arrival of early rice continued, and sales were slightly sluggish. The market shape for high-quality goods was slightly close to a jiao. The old and secondary grades were inconsistent. Yangjian arrived less and sold actively, and the market shape was stable. Bodu Jian was lacking in transactions, and Kejian was also a small number of points. Baiyuan was tired again by one chi.</p>

<p>After the first and second grade black tea from Qiyi arrived in Shanghai and opened, it initially fetched a price of 200 yuan to 140 yuan, and the tea houses only avoided losses. However, the recent telegram from Shanghai stated that the previous market price of 200 yuan has become a thing of the past. The opening price of the latest batch has dropped by 30 yuan. Tea merchants were greatly disappointed by this news. They all said that the cost price of the first batch of black tea was 160 yuan, which was a large reduction compared to previous years. The cost price was lower, and the risk was naturally less. Now, the result is still a loss. The tea farmers suffered great losses due to the decline in mountain prices. Therefore, although the mountain tea is currently suitable for picking and processing, it is not accepted by the tea houses, and there is supply but no demand.</p>
<p>The Tunxi tea houses previously reduced their intake of tea due to the poor market in Shanghai. Recently, the Shanghai market sales have become smoother, and the news that Zhenmei is selling for 140 to 50 yuan has spread. The local tea houses have also greatly increased their processing. In recent days, the transaction volume of raw tea has been very large. The medium grade is sold for 48 yuan, and the low grade is sold for 30 yuan. Mountain households are still holding on to the famous tea of ​​Dayuan and are unwilling to sell it cheaply. The mountain price is still around 80 yuan. Tea houses are afraid of this high price, which increases costs, so they dare not set a price or open scales. Looking at the Tunxi tea market in recent days, it seems to be trending towards activity. In the future, the mountain price may increase.</p>

<p>Since the new tea went on the market at the beginning of last month, the total amount of black and green tea that has arrived from various routes has reached 134,281 boxes. Among them, the amount of black tea from Qimen Fuliang Jiande and Ningzhou Wenzhou Hekou and other routes is 68,423 boxes. Qining floral fragrance is calculated separately as 3,617 boxes. The amount of green tea from Tunxi Wudong Jixian Suian Wenzhou Pingshui Tuzhuang and other routes is a total of 62,241 boxes. In the past month or so, the sales volume of black tea has totaled 32,305 boxes, and green tea 40,554 boxes. During this period, the black tea market was unusually unfavorable. The current market price has fallen by an average of 60 to 70 yuan per dan compared to the opening price. Although green tea has also fallen by 20 to 30 yuan to 40 to 50 yuan, the situation seems to be stable. The current inventory is 39,735 boxes of black tea and 21,687 boxes of green tea. However, the source of black tea has been exhausted, and there is still a large amount of green tea continuing to arrive in Shanghai.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the tinplate market in the UK and the US saw a very strong market trend due to the active processing of domestic manufacturers and Tianjin merchants.

It is estimated that 90-pound British goods are worth 16 yuan and 8 jiao, and 100-pound goods are worth 17 yuan and 9 jiao. 90-pound US goods are worth 20 yuan and 2.5 jiao, and 100-pound goods are worth 22 yuan, which is 2 to 3 jiao better than the previous market. However, overseas telegrams have been rising frequently recently, so the local market price may increase.</p>

<h3 id="e274">Talking about Eating <a href="#e274" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c274" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">274</a></h3>
<p>— Wu</p>
<p>Eating is difficult, not in the sense of getting food from hand to mouth, but in the sense of getting food into one's hands. This is true not only in years of natural disasters, droughts, and rebellions, but also in the prosperous times of abundant harvests. Last year's bumper harvest was said to have been a disaster because of the surplus of American wheat. However, since this was not uttered from the mouth of a sage, it does not seem very credible. Moreover, the reason why the officials of the authorities wanted to purchase American wheat was originally out of great compassion to relieve the famine victims who had no food to eat. Although the people in the Yangtze River basin are used to eating white rice, foreign wheat flour can still fill their stomachs. Therefore, now that the good intentions have turned into bad intentions, isn't it a terrible wrong? However, it is true that wheat turns into money, and money turns into rice bran, and the famine victims who are crying for food cannot get it in the end.</p>
<p>In this way, eating is really not easy. For example, rich people must eat white rice, and they must have top-quality chicken, fish, and other dishes to be able to eat it. However, eating like this for a long time will inevitably become greasy. So they change to eating Western food to change the taste. Moreover, it is said that white rice lacks vitamins and can even cause beriberi. Therefore, doctors will advise them to eat some brown rice, and preferably some wheat bran. This may not be to their liking, but for the sake of prolonging life, there is no other way. There are also many gentlemen and ladies who, because they eat too well, become very fat. In the eyes of fortune tellers, this is naturally a great blessing. One cannot carry fortune without meat. However, after carefully looking at themselves in the mirror for a while, and then comparing themselves with the photos of movie stars or socialites, they cannot help but feel sad. It is because they are fat and plump, and there is no sense of curves. It is inevitable that the old gentlemen will become disgusted and have affairs. Therefore, in addition to consulting tailoring experts and planning on clothes, they must also practice reducing food, reducing a bowl to half a bowl, and replacing fish and meat with vegetables. The so-called "to endure the bitterness of all bitternesses is to be above others." If gentlemen and ladies want to become committee members' wives, they cannot but practice hard like this. In the end, of course, they will have a slender figure, which can be danced in the palm of the hand. Wearing a cheongsam, they will be full of curves. How can the old gentlemen not be delighted? Even beautiful men like Bao Yu would have to take a few more glances at their jade arms and slender waists.</p>
<p>As for the people who have no white rice to eat and have to fill their stomachs with sour rice that others do not eat, of course, they do not need to be mentioned in the same breath. Many gentlemen and great men say that they are destined to be like this, probably because they have committed many sins in their previous lives. However, it is always true that they have no food to eat. Who can they hate? Only they themselves will know.</p>
<h3 id="e275">Sin <a href="#e275" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c275" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">275</a></h3>
<p>— Yu</p>
<p>The distant mountains are shrouded in the sun's rays. Zhao Jie, who is driving the ducks, jumps and runs, carefree, singing mountain songs like "Sister Lang" to the river. Father Ashun holds a dry pipe and sits on the threshing ground in front of the door. He looks at the sunlight on the opposite mountain, and blurts out, "Another day." His many-wrinkled forehead is tanned to a purplish-black color by the sun. He exerts himself like he doesn't want to admit he's old, and the blue veins spread like snakes all over his black arms. He wants to laugh, but the sunlight has already risen into the sky, shining on his back and giving him a slight sense of attention. The dry pipe doesn't leave his lips, and he tries to take a few puffs, but it has already gone out. A song "Sister, watch the ducks by the river" is sent over, and Father Ashun shakes his head. He looks around at the sky, the green sky, boundless. He is disappointed, "Another day!"</p>
<p>He wrinkles his many-wrinkled old face. He thinks. Landlord Lu's third son said yesterday that Hankou was flooded again, how come we don't see a drop? Son, daughter-in-law, go to pump water early in the morning, that little river is probably going to dry up too. These hundreds of acres of fields all depend on this river. Hmm, there will always be a day when it dries up! He raises his head, the sunlight is like the planet Venus, stinging his eyes. He wipes the sweat from his forehead with his rough cloth sleeve, and tries to take a few puffs of his cigarette, but it has already gone out. "Hmm! Another day!"</p>
<p>In the evening, under the kerosene lamp, Father Ashun talks again about the dozens of dollars he owed last year. This is what he says every night, as if the reason it doesn't rain is that his family is in debt. Ashun's father just patted Ashun to sleep. He had sold a day's labor, and tonight, after hearing his father's words, it was especially harsh, as if his father was saying that he didn't work hard enough. He raises his two hairy legs, and the blisters on the soles of his feet are reflected in his father's hating eyes. He wants to smoke, but it has already gone out. "Ashun, go to sleep, it might rain tomorrow!" The old man, holding his early pipe, walks to the threshing ground, and his son Ashun secretly follows him out, feeling his father's unnatural posture, thinking to himself that he is a son and shouldn't be so temperamental. Why get so worked up? Father also hopes that this year's harvest will be good and pay off the debt.</p>
<p>The old man raises his head and sees a sky full of stars. This is a sign that it will be sunny tomorrow. He sighs.</p>
<p>"Father!" Ashun calls apologetically.</p>
<p>"Why aren't you going to sleep?" The old man still wants to hide his worried face.</p>
<p>"Father, we had such a good harvest last year, but we still owed more than thirty dollars. This year, there is bound to be a drought. Look at the stars in the sky, there are still ten and a half months, and the river will be out of water too." Ashun sees a tear rolling down the corner of his father's eye. He doesn't say the words "Let's give up the field and go to work," and changes the subject, "Let's wait another day, it will rain one day!"</p>
<p>The old man is discerning his son's words. "Hmm, a good harvest last year, a great year, but we still owed more than thirty dollars. It hasn't rained this year, and the river is going to dry up. Hmm, hmm, probably the villagers did something wrong, and the God of Heaven is punishing us. Sin, sin!" He seems to have found a satisfactory answer. He wants to smoke, but it has already gone out.</p>
<p>The sky is full of stars, shining like a woman's eyes. "Hmm, sin, let's wait one day, it will rain one day!"</p>

<h3 id="e277">Stealing a Little Extra <a href="#e277" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c277" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">277</a></h3>
<p>— Xiao Zhi</p>
<p>In Shanghai, "stealing a little extra," I hear, is what bosses, managers, factory directors, and important gentlemen are most worried and anxious about, something they must devise ways to deal with and prevent. However, another group of people indeed regard this as their only lifeline. For example, the public bus owner is pained because the ticket seller steals a little extra. That drop of extra the worker skims is the owner's lifeblood; how can the owner not be distressed? Therefore, in addition to checking tickets, they repeatedly change fares and install some contraption at the door. Supposedly, these are the owner's effective ways to prevent stealing a little extra. On the other hand, a streetcar ticket seller says, "I have an old mother and a wife at home, and children who need to go to school. Damn it, the salary is only twenty yuan, and every month, they deduct several tenths of my pay for some violation. If I rely on this for living expenses, wouldn't my whole family starve to death?" Thus, his only way out is to "steal a little extra."</p>
<p>I am a laborer who spends all day on the streets. Why am I also interested in two things related to stealing a little extra? Since we're talking about "stealing a little extra" today, I'll just write it down here in bits and pieces:</p>
<p>(1) A few days ago, the western part of Shanghai was extremely hot. Living in a pigeon cage as small as mine, located in a slum, it was naturally too hot to sit still. So I joined the crowd sitting along the roadside to enjoy the cool. Occasionally, an open-top car, fully loaded with young men and women singing love songs loudly in red and green, sped past us. A fragrant breeze immediately arose in front of each of us, making us feel extraordinarily refreshed. Then, another car, and another. So we continuously enjoyed the fragrant breeze and crisp singing, and sincerely thanked our brothers and sisters who were driving around in cars!</p>
<p>(2) Movie theaters and dance halls are naturally places we cannot afford to go. In fact, they were never meant for us in the first place! But every time I walk alone to the end of Nanjing Road, at the intersection of Xizang Road, I would unconsciously stop and stare intensely at the colorful movie posters, trying to "steal a little extra." Here, I gained a lot of knowledge: First, I learned that there are sensual embraces, sweet kisses, bare legs, and half-naked breasts in movie theaters. Moreover, there are guns, savages, resurrected mummies, and other things I have never seen or heard of.</p>
<p>In fact, "stealing a little extra" is not limited to Shanghai; it's the same everywhere. If a person is born with eyes and is willing to open them wide, they will know that everyone living in today's society is desperately trying to "steal a little extra." They will know that today's society is simply a society of "stealing a little extra," and the world is simply a world of "stealing a little extra"!</p>
<h3 id="e278">Love Problems <a href="#e278" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c278" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">278</a></h3>
<p>— Shen Min</p>
<p>In this vast world, countless beings sacrifice countless young men and women and bury countless heroes and heroines for the sake of one word: "love." The storms in the sea of love never cease. Not only is money lost, but precious spirit is sacrificed, even to the point of disgrace, suicide, lawsuits, and jealous assassinations. Some young ladies from prominent families or modest backgrounds, seduced by money or blinded by vanity, weak-willed women, cannot resist the temptation of these frivolous men and so embark on the path of "free love" in a confused state. However, those who constantly talk about "freedom" probably misunderstand it, treating it as a game. They may not truly understand the meaning of "free love," since they are fickle, quickly switching partners and treating everyone the same while pursuing this "free love." Consequently, various consequences arise, and unexpected things happen.</p>
<p>Looking at the meaning of the word "love" from the perspective of character dissection, it is the heart of youth. Therefore, emotionally rich youths are bound to encounter this word and mostly swim in the sea of love, tumbling in the net of love.</p>
<p>The character "lian" (恋, love) has the "change" radical at the top, so it is unpredictable. One moment in love, the next moment changing hearts, love affairs, marital changes, transformations without end. This was destined by Cangjie when he created the characters and cannot be altered.</p>
<p>As for the character "ai" (爱, love), the upper part is "shou" (受, receive/suffer) and the lower part is "you" (忧, worry). Therefore, to speak of worries about love, one must first endure a period of pain, and the result ultimately cannot escape worry and disappointment.</p>
<p>Humans are not saints; who can be without emotions? But in using emotions, it is important to be dedicated and not indiscriminate. When used properly, it is love; when used improperly, it is lovelessness. Alas! Love! Heartless as iron! Love where money is omnipotent! Love that is nothing but snobbery! Except for those with money and influence who can enjoy unexpected success in the arena of love, the rest of the masses, working diligently, rushing around, and striving with all their might, focus on love with no past grudges or present grievances. They bravely advance, work hard, attack, only to temporarily end things. They lure the enemy deep, wait for the enemy to attack, retreat to the last line of defense, raise the "no battle" sign, and might even be forced to sign a treaty of surrender by the other party. At that time, nerves shattered, intentions lost, and heartbroken, they can only lament their ill fate. Disappointed in love, they recall the sweet embraces and dances of the past. Today, everything has changed to a tragic jump into the Huangpu River. Alas! One wrong step leads to eternal regret, and turning back is a hundred years too late.</p>

<p>Shop Employee Correspondence</p>
<h3 id="e279">Heartless Older Brother <a href="#e279" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c279" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">279</a></h3>
<p>Editor:</p>
<p>I am indeed a comrade who enjoys reading the Shop Employee Correspondence, even though I am not an employee of any store. Today, upon seeing the following sentences in your answer to Mr. Huang regarding "Whether or not to become an uxorilocal son-in-law": "There are now people who, after marrying a wife, often treat members of their family as strangers," I suddenly felt as if a sharp needle had pricked my long-suppressed grievances. Therefore, I am writing this specifically to ask for your advice. You shouldn't reject me just because I am not a shop employee!</p>
<p>I have an older brother who, just as you said, "treats members of his family as strangers after marrying a wife." What's even more hateful is that he has cut off financial support to the family, although we didn't need his support before. But when we asked him for money sometimes, he would at least give us some. Now, my family of several relies solely on my father, whose monthly income is limited, often leading to financial difficulties. Therefore, he once mentioned asking my brother to provide more support, but he flatly refused, saying that he was overwhelmed with his own expenses and had no money to spare. Sometimes, my mother, with a sad face, asked to borrow money temporarily, promising to repay it when my father received his salary, but he still refused. So my brother is now someone who wouldn't give even a hair. Alas! Sir, my father is an honest and kind man and has never said a word about his son's change in behavior. My father is already over fifty and constantly feels uneasy due to financial difficulties, causing him to become increasingly thin. My mother also often complains, saying things like, "It's better not to have such an unfilial son."</p>
<p>Is my brother really without money? Absolutely not. Doesn't my sister-in-law spend money on daily tonics and clothes? But the hateful sister-in-law often deliberately says in front of us that these tonics were bought for her by her family, and that a certain fabric was a gift from someone, and that the few dollars she won playing mahjong were used by him (referring to my brother). It's infuriating to hear!</p>
<p>Sir, do you have any way to make my brother return to his previous state? If you don't mind, please give me a reply. Sincerely wish you</p>
<p>Editorial peace, Hong Xiuying</p>
<p>Editor's Note: The law divides human behavior into three categories: (1) Mandatory conduct, (2) Prohibited conduct, and (3) Permissive conduct. All legal obligations are mandatory conduct; if someone "does not act," the law can compel them to act or even impose a corresponding penalty. Any behavior that harms the legal rights of others is prohibited conduct; the law prohibits such behavior and punishes offenders. Everything else is permissive conduct: whether someone does it or not, the law does not interfere and is completely permissive. The law in our country stipulates that a person "has an obligation to support parents who are unable to support themselves." This is mandatory conduct; if they refuse to provide support, the parents can sue for "abandonment." According to your letter, although your father is over fifty, he is still able to go out and earn a living; although it is said that his income is insufficient, it cannot be immediately concluded that he is "unable to support himself." Therefore, your brother is not necessarily obligated to provide support. Moreover, in these times, it cannot be determined whether he has surplus resources based on the observations of others. However, to reiterate:</p>
<p>What is valuable in a person is "humanity." The composition of this "humanity" is very complex, but "compassion" for others is one of the most important factors. We dare not advocate that everyone achieve "loving not only one's own parents," but at the very least, "loving one's own parents" is essential. It seems highly appropriate to take the initiative to share the burdens of an elderly father over fifty who still has to struggle for a living. Unfortunately, this matter falls within the category of permissive conduct in the law, preventing us from using its authority to actively urge him to implement it. Without any other recourse, we can only passively "cry out." Therefore, unknowingly, we wrote that in our reply to Mr. Huang; perhaps Mr. Hong can understand our good intentions! So, you ask for a way to "make your brother return to his previous state." We have no other option except to say "use passive influence." This may disappoint you because the power of influence is often unable to overcome the magic of temptation! Furthermore, in all matters, it is better to rely on oneself than to rely on others. Since your brother has disappointed your parents, you should learn from your mother's words and say, "It's better not to have him." You should now reflect on yourself and seek ways to comfort your parents. Perhaps you are still young, and your knowledge and experience cannot enter the world yet, but I think three or four years can still be endured. You should now encourage the members of your family to practice "diligence and thrift" to reduce your father's burden, and in the spiritual aspect, try to comfort your parents as much as possible. Treat your brother as if you don't have one. Finally, I want to ask your brother, sister-in-law, and nephews/nieces (if any): Are you living together now? Is your brother responsible for their daily expenses? Since he is heartless, we can be righteous and ask him to set up his own household.</p>

<p>— Xi Lin</p>
<p>"Danli, it's settled, now it's settled. That short devil Sakawa is really good. I asked him to lobby the military, and they really took care of it. All my factories, shops, and houses are unharmed. No matter how much they bombard from Zhabei to Jiangwan, it doesn't matter. See? Isn't it good? What does a few tens of thousands of yuan in lobbying fees count for? And..." He paused here, as there were things he couldn't easily say, so he ended with "This is also good, after all, it's good for us too."</p>
<p>Third Mistress took his hand, stroking it gently. She admired him in these matters no matter what the size of the issue, he always had good methods for dealing with it. She remembered once when the workers went on strike at the factory, surrounding him. He smoothly picked out the older workers, chatted about their families, and explained the benefits and drawbacks, persuading the older people, thus dispersing the workers' front, and the matter passed peacefully. Once, a large batch of Japanese goods was found in the factory during an inspection. At first, everyone shouted to confiscate them or burn them cleanly, but he simply bribed a few leaders, so the newspapers reported it as a misunderstanding. As for his social skills, they were even more smooth and slippery. Everyone in Shanghai would give him a "good" rating.</p>
<p>What was the benefit he meant by "It's good for us too"? Third Mistress didn't have time to ask him because he continued to talk like a flowing river:</p>
<p>"The fighting started last night, did you know? Of course, I hope it ends quickly, otherwise, some losses are inevitable after all. We must find ways to maintain the market. Financial matters must be able to circulate. I'm also afraid that the rebels will take the opportunity to cause trouble! Okay, I won't talk to you about these things. Tonight, there's a tea dance at Zhao Yishan's house. Everyone will take this opportunity to discuss ways to maintain the market. I'll take you there tonight! Right now, it's still early, you should sleep for a while. People are important. I have to go to the bank again. Sakawa is waiting for me. He's introducing me to a coal deal. Changing the brand a little will definitely lead to large-scale sales. The price of coal has already soared this morning. It will definitely go up even more." After he finished speaking, he left.</p>
<p>Third Mistress felt that Jie Fu no longer loved her. He didn't come back all night last night, and he left again after sitting down for a short while this morning. However, after hearing Jie Fu's talk, she felt relieved about the war. The terror was just the worries of ordinary people. She got up and went to the bathroom to wash up. As she did so, she thought about how to spend this day, especially since it was only nine o'clock in the morning. Her friends were probably still asleep. She walked back into the room in a pair of embroidered slippers. First, she made herself very comfortable in the soft sofa, crossing her legs like a man, swaying her bare calves, showing that her entire body was lovely white flesh. Then, she took out a cigarette and smoked it, and then thought about picking up a romance novel to read.</p>

<h3 id="e281">Strange Happenings in Hollywood <a href="#e281" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c281" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">281</a></h3>
<p>— Xing Zhi</p>
<p>Jack Oakie and Ponchi's Engagement: A strange thing that has recently been rumored in Hollywood is that Jack Oakie of Paramount Pictures has suddenly fallen deeply in love with Ponchi Hawkins Josai, a well-known Hollywood star known for her many marriages. The inside story of this matter is very interesting, and people in Hollywood are talking about it with each other.</p>
<p>Compared to others at Paramount, Jack Oakie is the youngest. He has never been romantically involved with any woman in the film industry, which everyone in Hollywood knows. As for why he never had any romantic involvement with any woman, this question has also been raised by some people. According to Jack Oakie himself, none of the women in Hollywood meet his standards. This tone is very arrogant, and some of the women in Hollywood have even publicly questioned him in magazines and newspapers. Of course, these insulting words made the women of Hollywood very angry.</p>
<p>When Jack Oakie saw this group of Hollywood heroines being so aggressive, he immediately changed his tune, but some people already understood his meaning very well. It is said that Jack Oakie's biggest aversion in life is divorce. The reason he said that none of the women in Hollywood met his standards was that the women in Hollywood were too casual about marriage and divorced too easily.</p>
<p>Jack Oakie had never been in love with a woman during his years in Hollywood. But recently, this strange thing has happened, and he is even talking about marriage with a woman known for her many marriages. Who can say that this matter is not an absurdly strange thing?</p>
<p>Ponchi Hawkins Josai is a monster that everyone knows. Some say she has been married more than a dozen times, others say it's more than that. Even she herself doesn't know how many times she has been married. When asked, she said, "I haven't kept count."</p>
<p>People in Hollywood are talking about who among Ponchi's many husbands can ultimately prevail. And now Jack Oakie, who hates divorce, has actually fallen in love with Ponchi, who has divorced who knows how many times. Who can say that this isn't an absurd and strange thing?</p>
<p>What's even stranger is that Jack Oakie's mother, after hearing that her son Jack had fallen in love with the multi-married Ponchi, was so happy that she laughed through her tears. She said, "Ponchi is ridiculed by many people in Hollywood. She is a pitiful girl. I love her very much. She is very pitiful."</p>
<p>Film Review</p>
<h3 id="e282">Review of "The Millionaire" <a href="#e282" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c282" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">282</a></h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>After seeing "Love Affair," George Arliss's acting skills left a deep impression in my memory. Although the acting performance in "The Millionaire" is not as profound as in "Love Affair" due to the different content of the play, this other style of performance still has its merits. After watching it, when he was previously ill, he was melancholy and troubled, although he possessed huge wealth, the illness entangled him, so he could not but temporarily abandon his career. Regarding these, his performance has the same tone as the latter part of "Love Affair." Afterwards, during his recovery period, he was restrained by his wife and servants, causing mental confusion, but even when he was extremely unhappy, he still had to calm down. From this point on, he began running a gas station business with a young man. So he had the opportunity to work, although this was a secret affair behind his family's back, it had a great help on his health. Because of the restoration of his health, his nature also changed. He was lively, he had vitality, completely showing another kind of joyful spirit. As mentioned above, he completely grasped the transformation of the plot. All his actions, even in tone, showed his acting intelligence.</p>
<p>However, should we only see the advantages of performance and ignore the criticism of this content?</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, this is a work of praise for the wealthy. The factory owner being so supported by the workers, and his trying every means to promote young people to embark on the "road to success," are the important themes of this film. At the same time, a millionaire's management of business is just a kind of ordinary thing in times of nothing to do, which gives us a new inspiration. As for the director's technique, although it is all using old methods without features, the detail of the performance is very noteworthy. Of course, the composition of this film is completely focused on the performance of the protagonist, so the director often uses long "follow shots" so that George Arliss can fully perform. Other things such as the humor of the dialogue, but the lack of comedic elements in the action, can also be said to be the director's special features. We know that the director is the sole person responsible for the whole play, so we can see here that he did not abandon his own responsibility.</p>
<p>Other points, there is no need to explain in detail. In short, we can see the achievements of a few American works in this film.</p>
<h3 id="e283">A Critique of "Adultery" <a href="#e283" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c283" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">283</a></h3>
<p>— Yan Nan</p>
<p>I recall that not long ago, there was a film called "Full of Spring Colors." Now comes another one, "Adultery" (Pleasure Cruise). If these two titles are considered a translation, then the translator must have quite a wealth of poetic material in their mind. The content of the films is also quite similar. Let me first introduce some of the story.</p>
<p>A wife is restless, and a husband is weak. So, the wife goes on a trip alone, and the husband follows her. On the ship, the wife arranges a rendezvous with a young man, but the husband manages to lock the young man up and goes to the rendezvous himself. After disembarking, he tricks the young man into coming to their house and uses his wife's cigarette case to scare the young man away. The husband and wife then return to their usual loving relationship.</p>
<p>What is the theme of the play? It only teaches husbands how to restrain their wives and maintain love with a cold, witty, and humorous method. However, many small details are very endearing, depicting a woman with a conscience and a widow who cannot bear to be alone, both vividly and meticulously. Of course, it is entirely considered a comedy, so many places seem like child's play, but not nonsense. It just lightly makes people laugh.</p>
<p>The director is indeed very successful with this kind of comedic film. It starts with a nude painting, leading into the main text, its subtlety is incredible. The whole film has very complex writing, but only uses large-scale fades in and out to indicate the transition of time and space. Sometimes, even the actors' faces are not captured in the camera. This clever simplification makes the story even more compact. The scene of the rendezvous, although uses simple strokes, the thoughts and actions of the three protagonists before the appointment are very detailed, which is truly the director's unique skill. However, some parts in the middle are described excessively. A romantic woman, who can later settle down at home, and a coward who can come up with clever deception methods are not facts that the audience can imagine. Moreover, although this husband is smart, he doesn't show much genuine affection. How can he move his wife to change her mind? But the film ends just like that. The scene of the couple's personality and emotional breakdown is excellent. In short, the director is very transcendent in terms of partial aspects, but seems unable to take care of the overall situation, partly due to the script itself and the burden of conforming to humor and comedy. Although many of the shots are extremely beautiful, the brilliance completely complements the sub-sections. How ordinary the light is throughout the film! The sets and props are simply designed, and many scenes on the ship seem to be filmed on location, so everything is very realistic. The dialogue is wonderful. Eight out of ten parts that make people laugh and feel happy are created by the dialogue. The interludes are very important, and in some places, they even overshadow the main story, but it is definitely not a disadvantage because such interludes are very exciting and do not break the plot.</p>
<p>Roland Young is the most outstanding in this film. He plays the husband. In the first half, his actions describe a "shrinking man" perfectly, and the liveliness in the second half is even more interesting. Everything is very natural. Moreover, every word and action makes people laugh, and composure contains humor. Geneyieve Tobin, who plays the wife, is very beautiful. Her surprise and forced composure are well-expressed, but her romantic performance is a little lacking. The widow and the barber are humorous and likeable. The rest only appear in fragments, acting as living backgrounds.</p>
<p>The technique and performance of this film are the best, but the story is not very complete.</p>
<p>The supporting film is about Indian customs and the enlightenment of the Tang Dynasty. The newsreel is very good, including Shaw's swimming and being surrounded by reporters, which is very interesting.</p>
<p>In short, this time the program is a very superior production by Fox Film Corporation.</p>
<p>Audience Opinions</p>
<h3 id="e284">Returning from the Great Light <a href="#e284" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c284" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">284</a></h3>
<p>— Jia Nan</p>
<p>The long-rumored reorganization of the film palace, the Great Light, opened today. When I passed by there at a little after six o'clock, I already saw the milky white lights reflecting countless crowds, surrounding the "sold out" sign. When I stepped into that palace gate at nine o'clock, there were still many movie fans, lining up around the ticket window like Japanese soldiers in North China, refusing to leave, preparing to wait for an unexpected opportunity.</p>
<p>I entered through a door next to the five-colored fountain, stepping on the green long carpet. In the hustle and bustle, I found my seat and squeezed in. The time had passed the scheduled hour, but one record after another kept playing. It wasn't until after nine-thirty that the lights gradually dimmed, and the usual newsreel, comedy, and song and dance film, one after another, passed by. Finally, the main feature, "Hot-Blooded Ambition," began.</p>
<p>This story is based on a story during the war described by Rear Admiral Edward Ellsberg. It tells the story of a young naval officer who abandoned his lover, honor, and life to win glory for the nation and country. It is indeed worthy of being a model for modern soldiers. In particular, he did not wait for orders, but launched torpedoes, bombed enemy ships, and finally let his companions escape, sacrificing himself to accomplish a great mission. This spirit should truly shame the soldiers who only know how to maintain their strength, practice non-resistance and falsely claim to resist Japan, and seize territory.</p>
<p>In terms of performance, Montgomerie's dashing, natural, and resolute attitude is naturally the best. Huston's officer, giving orders in battle with a calm and composed demeanor, is indeed in line with the identity of the character in the play. Evans did not have a very brilliant performance in this film. She appeared too much in the first half of the play, especially the dance scenes, which took up a lot of time, almost making the audience unable to find the center of the whole play. Apart from a few scenes in the amusement park and dancing scenes, the photography felt too rigid, but the rest was okay.</p>

As he spoke, he went into the bedroom to change clothes. Lou immediately busied herself. She both arranged the seating for Rudolf and bribed and sent away the policeman who was monitoring the scene. On the one hand, she called Elena and told her to leave Vienna quickly because he was coming. If he couldn't see her, he would definitely rush to her house or fight with her husband. Lou had just finished instructing when suddenly there was an uproar in the living room. She listened attentively and shrugged her shoulders. It turned out that Elena had already arrived. At this time, dinner was ready, and everyone went to the large dining room together. Elena also followed into the dining room. Lou quickly closed the dining room door and ran to see Rudolf. Rudolf had already changed into a brand new military uniform, looking quite dignified as in the old days. He ran out of the bedroom. Lou tried to stop him, but he pushed her aside. He ordered Elena to be brought in. Lou told him that the guests had just taken their seats, and it would be better to ask him to go to the large dining room.</p>
<p>Rudolf insisted that someone bring Elena to see him, and also demanded champagne. Lou had no choice but to send someone to call Elena. Soon Elena came. When she saw Rudolf, she couldn't speak for a moment, but stood gracefully in front of him. Rudolf looked at her carefully from head to toe. She stood like a marble statue. Suddenly, Rudolf slapped her in the face. She remained silent. Suddenly, he hugged her again and kissed her forcefully. "How long has it been since you were kissed like this? Ten years? More than ten years! Think about it!"</p>
<p>Elena still stood motionless. Rudolf still kissed her, but a little more tenderly than before. He said, "Come, let's have some champagne together." Elena slowly followed him, as if she were hypnotized by him. After a while, she opened her mouth and said that she had completely forgotten him. Rudolf said that it was a pity, but tonight, everyone should reminisce about the old times. He drank the champagne, but she only raised her glass and put it down again.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Rudolf saw the wedding ring on Elena's hand. He shouted, "Oh, this middle-class decoration on your finger is really too out of place. I don't like to see it. We must take it off." After he finished speaking, he snatched the ring from Elena's finger.</p>
<p>"Give it back! Give me back the ring!" Elena shouted anxiously.</p>
<p>"Yes, darling, I will definitely return it to you tomorrow morning."</p>
<p>"I won't see you tomorrow morning. Return it to me now," Elena pleaded. But Rudolf had already hidden the ring in his pocket. (To be continued)</p>
