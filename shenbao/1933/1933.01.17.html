<p>（日内瓦）國聯十九國特委會、今日下午四時舉行非公開會議、此次第一次會議中、僅由主席希孟向出席各代表報告在假期中與雙方當事國代表談話之經過、此項談話目的、乃以去歲十二月間十九國委員會通過之决議草案爲根據、圖謀雙方當事國之諒解、希孟與國聯會秘書長德魯蒙努力求使日本接受此項草案、爲欲達到此目的、十九國委員會擬以主席宣言、替代該委員會之理由說明書、則以此項理由說明書實爲日本方面所竭力反對故也、此外决議草案本文中、對於承認「滿洲國」與不承認「滿洲國」一層、均不提及云、日本代表團業將此項修正辦法電達東京、日本政府將於明日國務會議中提出討論、故在明晚以前、日本政府正式答復、不能送達日内瓦、故十九國委員會大約遲至星期三開會、（十六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）中代表顏博士因議案之修正、迄未告知中國代表團、頃特致函特委會主席希孟、内稱、中政府甚注重十二月二十六日提出之修正文及草議案與理由說明書、故中國代表團覺有請主席注意於此事之必要、今代表團聞中國修正文所根據之草案原文、已有更改、頗爲煩慮、代表團迄未接到此項文字更改之副本、若果如所傳、則此更改文字對於雙方之一方、大不公允、將使和解爲中國所不能接受、故代表團請以眞確内容相告云、（十六日路透電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）顏博士致希孟之函、似將引起今日午後十九特委會集會時之重要討論、因特委會之若干委員亦覺未經事前核准、無人有權更改草議案也、聞國聯秘書長德魯蒙與國聯副秘書長杉村所定妥協之基礎、（須待日政府承認）係一種協定性質、如東京核准之、則將提交特委會、作爲日人提議、此中經過情形、將在開會時說明之、（十六日路透電）</p>

<p>猶憶月前英西門爵士發表對於中日問題之演說。我輿論界認爲有袒日之嫌。而加以忠告。旋經英當局聲明。英國忠誠擁護會章。决不違反向來公平之態度。我國人深感英當局之能受善言而信其必不欺我國人也。乃今値日人肆橫於榆熱之日。十九國委員特會開會之時。而忽有五國小組會提出所謂德魯蒙新草案。此新草案係將前十九國特會所成草案加以修改。由國聯秘書長德魯蒙與日代表秘密諒解而成。旣未將不承認滿洲僞組織列入。復未顯然邀請俄美參加。此兩點爲我外我代表力爭於十九國特會而得。我國人猶嫌特會之草案。過於懦弱。乃不謂今日德魯蒙之新草案。竟專徇日人之意。一筆抹煞中國方面之意思。誠如路透電所謂顯然未顧及中國絲毫之利益。而中央社之日内瓦電。則更說明各大國中之英國。尤圖修改原草案。明示讓步。使日本樂於接受。我人由斯觀察。不能不無疑於英國外交政策之偏助日本也。</p>
<p>更有一事足爲前說之印證者。向稱足以代表英外部態度之倫敦泰晤士報。十三日發表社論。稱「日人目的在取熱河。已屬無疑。列强所最關心者。厥爲戰事不應蔓延至中國本部。」又謂「日本軍人主張設立中立區域甚爲可採。蓋中立區域之法。固可推行於世界其他各地方。日本之計劃。可認爲妥協精神之表現。」其不問關外只問關内之口脗。已顯然盡情揭露。質言之。即謂日人侵略滿洲。列强可不干涉。即進而併呑熱河。亦可置不顧問。惟不願侵及中國本部。有礙列强在中國之利益。與近來日軍事當局所倡「負責領袖深知戰事延及中國本埠。將引起國際糾紛的危險。可避自當力避。」與齋藤首相所表示「日本解决熱河問題。須要努力不使事態擴大至滿洲國領土之外」等說。隱然若合符節。日人不使事態擴大之狂言。固不可信。然亦由此可以推知今日德魯蒙新草案之所由來。日英妥協成功之說所由起也。但國聯各强國。亦曾自思國聯所負之天責爲何事乎。我國代表迭次之呼訴。李頓調查團數閱月之奔馳。大會歷屆開會之所討論所决議。非爲解决滿洲問题乎。乃至今日忽欲置承認滿洲僞國問題於不問。則前此國聯之受理是案爲多事。一年來日内瓦集會研究之工作。亦屬徒勞。試問國聯以後再可以公理正義相號召乎。日昨密勒評論報載英法對日妥協之說。謂當日軍從上海撤退時英法曾秘密允許日本。對於滿洲問題不加干涉。我人固不敢如密勒報之毅然斷以頗屬可信。然以事實相印證。我人亦不敢斷其爲不足信也。</p>
<p>夫中英邦交。向稱親善。今之所以有此修改原案之舉。我人固可原諒其非眞有惡於中國。不過欲自保其在中國之市塲勢力。而急欲使中日接近耳。日本旣强硬不易就範。則惟有强懦弱無能之中國以遷就日本耳。殊不知此種理想。結果必與事實相反。以國聯之本身言。扶强抑弱。即違反國聯主張公理正義之本意。壓迫弱小愈甚。則不平之氣。鬱積於中。將來之反動。亦必愈力。今日資本主義各强國之武力。縱尙能藉其聲威。以維持於一時。弱小各國主張公正之代表。可以易人而使不出席。然一旦情見勢絀。必將一發而不可收拾。數年來早有此醞釀運動。今後將愈發而愈速。即以我國論。亦詎能久受壓迫而至死不動者。列强於此。宜早有所覺悟。以中日間形勢言。日人暴橫無理之侵略。我國以武力不敵。而隱忍順受。然而百年仇恨。愈積愈深。一旦宰割之苦痛。不能再受。勢必起而與之拚命。至於此時。難保不出於橫决。一切犧牲所不暇惜。一切秩序所不暇顧。則列强縱善自維護。恐亦不能不有所牽累此又爲列强所早應慮及者。</p>
<p>縱之列强心目中。以爲袒日抑華。足以苟安於一時。實爲最大之錯誤。竊願英國當局之翻然改圖。而不爲日本强力所脅。甘言所惑。斯則我國人所敢竭誠忠告者也。</p>

<p>二十四日下午之辯論</p>
<p>（雙方兩次表示意見）主席云、照往例行政院討論此種性質之報告書時、爭議之雙方代表、均得有兩次表示意見之機會、故日本代表除極簡短之表示外、此次已爲末次作較長演說之機會矣、</p>
<p>（松岡洋右再度狡辯）日本代表松岡洋右氏云、余對此項習例、並不十分熟悉、惟余對主席此次與余以再表示若干意見之機會、自極爲感謝、余昨日建議、中國代表對日本政治家之一人旣作嚴重之指控、自應提出證據、以實其說、此爲余之見解、然中國代表則不特未提出證據、不特未承認其確有證據、反提出余所著之一書、該書係日文、中國代表所引者、似尙未有錯誤、是可知中國代表對余在該書中所稱田中奏摺爲僞造一節、已經表示同意矣、然余對田中奏摺雖認其爲僞造、余却不曾指定任何人爲僞造犯、亦未曾言僞造者爲一中國人、余不過稱余得有報告、該奏摺爲僞造者而已、余在書中亦未指出地名、猶憶擬稿時、曾得可靠消息、謂該奏摺係北平某國陸軍參贊與若干中國人所共同僞造、余得此訊後、並不信之、因接受此種消息、自應極度謹愼也、又一消息則稱僞造該文件者、乃爲少數不負責任之日本人、此種僞造文件出售之人等、世界各國均有之、固不僅日本有之也、茲爲明瞭起見、請再爲諸君述一小掌故、數年前、吾人曾在東京集議、關於應提出於太平洋國交討論會之提案之事件、當時集議之後、並無結果、亦並未擬定任何計劃、其後余從最可靠方面得知已有某日本人草一報告、其中包含日本代表在東京會議席上應行提出之言論之計劃、該報告由中國方面以五萬元鉅金購去、此乃事實、余信其爲眞、此種行爲、各國之下流人物均有爲之者、固無作怪、惟中國代表以負有責任之地位、乃在行政院席上提出不能證實之指控、此乃余所大惑不解者也余之節略及演辭、悉以事實爲證明、對中國代表所稱中國國民政府並未充分指導對日經濟絶交運動一點、已加以事實上之反證、中國代表同時並承認、中國政府在若干限度中確曾參加並鼓勵此項運動、茲再提出一部分之證據如次、其一、爲南京國民政府行政院之命令、原文係華文、其譯文詳見調查團報告書附件第二三零頁、其中所述皆爲關於對在華日僑及日貨之抵制方法之訓示、其二、爲交通部航政局訓令第九號、爲令天津Tokai汽船公司者、該公司通常均用華文名稱、故中國政府認其爲華人企業、將其密令誤投一日商公司、吾人之所以獲得此項密令、厥爲是故、該項密令之内容、詳見調查團報告書附件第二三二頁、其三、爲北平國民黨部關於經濟絶交之訓令、其譯文曾由日本代表送達調查團備查、以上種種、皆可反證中國代表之言而無疑者、行政院諸君其詳察之焉、又關於中國代表今日下午所稱、余僅須指出一點、即中國代表雖稱余之演辭爲避免主要問題而着意枝節問題、實則渠之演辭、適爲夫子自道、余向右、則中國代表趨余之左、余向左、則中國代表趨余之右、是中國代表終不敢以正面對余也、關於田中奏摺問題、茲不再贅、關於中俄密約一節、中國代表謂其目的在防止日本之侵略華土、實則行政院諸君僅須一查歷史上的事實、即可明瞭孰是孰非、更無庸余之喋喋矣、至若中國代表所得之關於東北事件之電報、余實毫無所知、余之所不知者、余亦不喜論及之、故在必要時、余當對該事件追求事實、暇或可爲諸君提出畫面之陳述也、中國代表稱、中日爭議之主要點爲㈠日本在滿洲之軍事行動、日本已取得滿洲矣、其可稱爲自衛行動乎、㈡「滿洲國」獨立運動、此項運動、果否確爲出於當地民衆之自由意志、如日本所稱者乎、㈢撤兵問題、日本迄今尙未履行此項諾言、㈣日本曾允諾不再增進事態之嚴重性、日本果已確守其諾言乎、㈤本問題是否有和平方法解决之乎、以上各問題、日本政府對第一第二問題之答案爲「是」字、然中國代表之答案則爲「否」字、關於第三第四問題、中國代表之答案亦爲「否」字、關於第五點、余殊不明中國代表之所言、惟以意測之、則大致稱和平方法儘有、應由國際聯合會採用之而已、凡此各點、吾人已將日本之意見及立塲明白表示、現在可以無須多述、惟若必要時、余當於下次再爲諸君闡明也、最後、余敢言日本向爲國際聯合會最忠誠會員國之一、此儘可以事實及日本政府之行爲以爲證明、然中國則歷來絶無作爲、直至其對日本、或對他國有怨言時、始利用此國際和平組織、以提出不平、惟設若此後發展與日本之生存問題、或日本之維護東亞和平秩序之政策絶對不相容者、則日本政府此後仍希望繼續爲國聯之忠僕也、</p>
<p>（中國代表書面答覆）中國代表、日本代表所提出之數點、其須中國方面答覆者、將由中國代表團在下次席上或用書面答覆之、</p>
<p>（主席與松岡之辯論調查團之是否存在）「主席」余意今日下午、可以無需進行討論、待明日再行研究報告書、吾人所討論之案件、旣若是重要、當然應儘合理範圍、予中日雙方代表以表示意見之機會、同時吾人亦已有不少成功、故余希望明日下午即可對報告書再作討論也、</p>
<p>「松岡」關於昨日余所提出之保留點、未知主席已有若何主張、</p>
<p>「主席」日本代表之所稱、當係指行政院請調查團表示是否有變更其意見之一提議而言、余對此事之觀察、以爲照例在此種調查團解散之前、其主席以代表該團全體之資格、應出席行政院會議、對行政院會員提出關於報告書之問題加以解釋、此次吾人似亦應循例辦理也、</p>
<p>「松岡」若行政院對調查團所詢問及調查團所答之各問題、僅限於報告書本身、即當地事實之研究、則余或可接受此議、余對此點深冀主席予以明切之解釋、</p>
<p>「主席」余昨晚提議、爲請調查團團員集會、並考慮該團於獲聆兩國代表意見之後、是否對報告書之任何部分有變更其意見之意、故該團之集會、自應以報告書爲引據、　不及其他、</p>
<p>「松岡」余對此提議、表示異議、余意調查團現在已不存在、行政院若有請求、則調查團團員得表示意見、對報告書中若干事件及該團團員等在當地考察所得各點加以解釋、吾人但一考調查團之職務之範圍、即可明瞭此點、惟若行政院與調查團均許其開始對中國問題或滿洲問題互相問答、越出報告書及調查團當地考察所得之外、並引及數日來中日雙方所提出之節略·意見書·聲明書·演辭·以及其他一切、則余恐將被迫而對調查團每一團員提出許多詢問、詢問之端一開、則日本代表自有權對調查團之報告書及其附件乃至一切節略·意見書、聲明書·等所載各點、加以詢問、此恐非一星期或一個月不能竣事、行政院諸公其能不嫌太久乎、此所以余對此議表示反對也、</p>
<p>「主席」日本代表於此似有誤會、調查團所應置答之惟一問題、即於獲聆中日代表意見之後、是否仍持其報告書中之意見不變、或有增改其一部分意見之意而已、調查團自不得專門涉及中日代表之意見、更不得對中日雙方所表示之異議、加以答辯也、</p>
<p>「松岡」余意余並未誤解主席而主席則似有誤解余所主張者、茲姑假定主席對調查團全體或團員個人提出一問題、調查團或團員即以數日來之所討論者爲考慮而表示其意見、茲再假定此項意見、日本政府不能同意、則吾人自將提出質問、詢調查團或團員個人所以達到此項意見之理由、辯端一開、需時必久、行政院當未能於日本政府未得滿意之前、否認其質問之權也、茲再假定調查團全體、或團員個人對行政院聲稱、中日雙方數日來雖有辯論、而調查團在報告書中所列載之意見、則並無更變、日本代表於此亦自然須提出詢問、詢其何以若此、問答之端一開、恐非一個月不能完畢、</p>
<p>「主席」余意調查團之代表出席行政院後、日本代表之所表示異議者、自難免其發生、蓋行政院會員或主席自可詢問調查團主席是否有變更其意見之意之權、行政院旣可詢問代表該團之主席、則亦自可向調查團全體作同樣之詢問也、</p>
<p>「松岡」余意完全在調查團報告書範圍内之事、如若干事實之考研等等、自不妨向調查團團員提出詢問、惟調查團團員雖被請出席行政院會議、吾人亦不須向渠等詢問關於數日來行政院席上所曾討論之事、總之、調查團之問答、自應完全就其報告書爲範圍也、此外又有一點、余願致意者、即日本政府之意、報告書一經遞交之後、調查團實已不復存在、此點吾人前已言之、故當調查團被請出席行政院會議之時、吾人所以未表示異議者、因吾人默認調查團團員對行政院之考慮及進行應全不預聞也、是以吾人以爲行政院雖不妨向調查團團員個人詢問意見、惟不得向調查團整體詢問意見、並得請該團對於報告書及附件中各節、加以解釋、</p>
<p>「主席」關於調查團之尙否存在一點、余之意見已於昨晚表示、即調查團在正式由行政院解散之前、仍爲在在也、</p>
<p>「松岡」余對此項解釋、表示異議、然即使調查團尙屬存在、亦不應對在行政院内部進行之各項考慮表示意見、易言之、調查團不應視爲有權出席行政院表示意見並評判是非也、</p>
<p>「主席」惟行政院當然願知悉調查團之全部意見者、調查團之報告書、係草擬於中日雙方表示意見之前、故此項意見之中、或有數點足以更變調查團之主張者、此當然爲行政院所極願知悉者也、關於此點、余謹請行政院其他會員表示意見、以資參證、</p>
<p>（捷克代表主持正義）捷克代表班來士（Benes）云、余對主席關於此事程序問題所表示之意見、完全同意、按往例、行政院所指委之調查團等、在行政院開會時、均被請出席、俾行政院主席或會員對於調查團之意見、可請其加以解釋、或請其對於有關事項答問、余意此項習例、完全與國聯盟約關於開會程序事件之規定相符合、即對於在行政院前爭議之雙方之一種忠實的情感、亦不相背、此種事件自應公開討論、故在余之見解、主席所提議者、完全與行政院之精神及往例符合也、至於調查團是否繼續存在一節、余意報告書中所謂「吾人之工作現已告竣」者、實爲「吾人在當地之工作、現已告竣」之意、而不能作爲調查團不擬在行政院前答問之解也、又有進者、行政院所擬定之政治方案、當然應因行政院會員自己擬定之、此爲事實問題、而非形式問題、蓋調查團當然不能發表政治意見、惟行政院主席及會員等、對於報告書中各節、在任何時期中、自有追尋解釋之權、故以余個人意見、目前雖並無需調查團解釋之問題、然却甚願有可以提出問題之機會也、</p>
<p>「主席」行政院其他會員、尙有願對此點表示意見者乎、</p>
<p>「松岡」余對此點、請再爲明晣簡當之表示、去年十二月十日行政院所議决之議案、即指委本調查團者、稱「决定委派一五人組織之調查團、赴當地考察、並對行政院報告」、余之意見、即以此節爲根據、夫吾人當前之案件、旣爲重大、則調查團之職務之規定、自不容不明白認清也、</p>

<p>｜胡良存君來信｜</p>
<p>我們黟縣年來盜匪充斥，搶刦頻聞；人民不能自衛於前，官廳又無法破案於後，以致匪𦦨�</p>
<p>日張，人心惴惴。推原禍始，一方固由不良社會所造成，一方亦由邑人慢藏所招致，千金做屋，百金買田，驕奢之氣，闊綽之風，匪徒不覬覦者幾希？至於地方武力，雖有縣府警隊維持，然考諸實際，不但有等於零，且徒使吾人增無限感慨。上年該警隊，一部份曾經譁變，變後復行招編，社會治安，其將何恃，當此之時，應用如何方法以自衛？敬乞　先生有以指敎！</p>
<p>覆：『人民自衛』這個問題，有兩個意思：一個是對於不良的政治，地主豪紳的剝削謀自衛；一個是對於盜匪謀自衛。來信意在對於『匪徒』謀自衛，其實我們要了解匪徒所由產生的原因，然後才可以講求自衛之道，匪徒之所以滋多，是因爲：㈠中國的農村受了資本帝國主義的商品經濟直接間接的剝削，農村一天一天地破產，譬如今年各處豐收，然而政府當局又借了一大批美麥來，市塲上的麥價，遭了慘跌，農民雖收了大夥的穀糧，依然是在過荒年。農民的田地要賣都賣不掉。㈡苛捐雜稅一天一天加重，農民每年所收穀糧，至少要拿出百分之五十以上來繳納租稅㈢地主的剝削，高利貸的剝削，佃農更是不能自了，而且㈣現在各處逼收罌粟捐，據說徽州各屬一年所收鴉片烟捐，就有八九百萬。這樣層層地剝削，農村那有不迅速破產的道理。兼之帝國主義者層層壓迫與其勾結下的中國軍閥，天天在那里作惡，今天這兒起了内戰，明天那兒又是日本兵打了來，全國的經濟完全陷於衰敗的現象，這自然也很快地影響到農村。於是農村的衰落更是一日千里。再說，好的一方面，沿江一帶差不多已經普遍地採用了資本主義的生產手段，用蒸汽犁，用機器灌溉，用電力，這末一來，農村中的勞動者的失業更是一天一天地加多，一小部分走以了城市，一大部分仍然是在那鄕村做流浪人。他們不願意『坐以待斃』，當前出有兩條路：一則當兵，一則從匪。這是中國各地的普遍現象，貴處情形當亦大致相同。所以失業的農民穿上軍衣，便可以做縣警隊，脫下軍衣，落了草便可做匪徒。鄭板橋說得好『盜賊亦窮民耳』！在今日而言對匪自衛，就必然要聯想到中國整個的農村經濟的狀况，聯想到中國整個的經濟狀况與政治狀况。治標之策有如下幾椿：㈠要求官廳剷除苛捐雜稅；㈡反對任何烟苗捐，由地方平民團體公同負禁烟之責，務期農村經濟不爲種烟所破壞；㈢嚴格地反對地主與商業資本的高利貸與非人道的剝削：㈣地方所有公共田地應由民衆團體公同管理，分配給失業農民耕種，其所有權須屬於地方，農民僅僅完納百分之十的地租於地方，做爲公共事業的經費；㈤縣警根本解散，敎他們去種公家田產。至於地方治安之責，則由地方共同組織地方保安隊，各家抽丁組織之。惟須大權持之民衆，而不爲土豪劣紳所把持，不然，便又成了一種變相的縣警隊。如是，一方面給農村開一個經濟的來源，一方面又給　剷除不必要的痛苦，農村經濟自可相當保持，失業减少，盜匪或許也要少了。然而這還是『頭痛醫頭』的辦法。若欲根本『自衛』，那就非把現在的制度根本改造不可。我們有機會再說罷。</p>

<p>我有一個母親，一個姊姊，和一個弟弟。我四歲時死了父親，我們依着母親困苦到現在。過去我們的生活，姊姊的出閣，我和弟弟的讀書，都是靠着遺產二十四畝薄田渡過。二十四畝田的收穫，每年估計八十元左右，田裏的油車修理，和一家四口的生活費，都靠在這每年八十元的收入上，在這二十年中，天災人禍，不絶的波及到我那偏僻的内地，帝國主義經濟侵略他影響到國内農村經濟生活，憑這年入八十元，無論如何儉省，怎樣也不够支持我們的生活！可憐我的母親，領着我們一班年幼的人，祗有困苦的奮鬥！起先還是向戚友們請請會（按請會爲敝地人民經濟互助方法之一種，如請一百元的會，須請十個友好，每十個月舉行一次，會首有得頭會而不給會利的權利，）來維持一時，可是到了行會的時候，又拿不出這大量的錢來凑會，因此，只有典質田產，舉行印子債，（利息三分）來彌補。如此剜肉醫瘡，勉强度過了十餘年。現在我雖然有了職業，但年祗不過五十元的收入，家中共負債有三千七百餘元之巨，估價賣田頂屋，也不過抵到全債務二分之一；且在這經濟恐慌萬狀的内地，連田也賣不出，典户又故弄玄虚有意呑呑吐吐。一方面債權人則威逼催索，終日不能安寗，弄得我家中愁雲滿室，氣得母親生了病！我眞慚愧，我竟不能使我的母親安心！現在我要問的是：㈠田地賣不出，典户又故意不肯購買；希冀我們到了萬分困苦的時候，削價廉售與他，這種地主剝削的手腕，眞是可恨！但可不可以强行賣給典户？㈡債權人催索積欠，債務人無力償還，生活幾於斷絶，債務人應如何處置？法律上有無憐惜債務人困苦予以原諒之規定？㈢法律上可否宣告破產？</p>
<p>覆：來信所問三點，第一點，依法是不可能的；第二第三點，法律上雖無「憐惜貧窮予以原諒」的規定，但債務人如確已一無所有，法律也並不强其償還，至於宣告破產，目前還没有人實行過，現在足下似惟有盡其所有，抵償債務，（自然，你一家人應有之生活費是應該另外保留的。）再有不足，或另寫期票，否則祗有任令債權人起訴，法院决不能强足下無中生有的。望足下忍耐應付，不必憂慮。</p>

<p>第三種　兒童自己審察衛生習慣分數共一百分五·一，我早晨刷我的牙齒五·二，我在早晨大便一次五·三，我在早晨前洗我的臉和兩手五·四，我在馬路上走過總是看看有没有汽車駛來五·五，我到學校裏身上一切都是整潔的五·六，我不論在學校或我家裏都用自己的杯子喝水五·七，我没有喝茶五·八，我一天喝了三杯以上的凉白開水五·九，我從來没有把鉛筆尖放到口裏或嘴唇上五·十，我站立的時候身體總是端正前胸是挺出的五·十一，我飯前便後必洗手五·十二，我每天必在户外游玩至少一小時五·十三，我食物的時候必把食物細嘴而後往下嚥五·十四，我難得吃糖的五·十五，我整天是快樂的五·十六，我每星期必洗澡一次五·十七，我每天吃飯必要吃點菜蔬類的食物五·十八，我睡前必刷牙一次五·十九，我每晚九時前必上床睡五·二十，我睡覺的時候必開窗</p>

<p>高級</p>
<p>Ａ是非法</p>
<p>㈠凡是蚊子都能傳染瘧疾的</p>
<p>Ｂ認識法</p>
<p>㈠種牛痘</p>
<p>a最好在春天</p>
<p>b最好在秋天</p>
<p>a四季都能種</p>
<p>b最好在冬天</p>
<p>中級</p>
<p>Ａ是非法</p>
<p>㈠一種牛痘是預防天花的</p>
<p>Ｂ塡完法　（基本衛生習慣）</p>
<p>㈠我每······至少洗浴······次</p>
<p>右列五種表的内容、各敎師儘可參酌情形加以增損、此間不過　例吧了、健康敎育不重智識而重習慣、藉這五張表可把家長的考察、敎師的調查、兒童的報告、三方面對比、證明兒童的習慣、態度智識究竟若何狀態、并可知道兒童缺少什麽、需要什麽、這樣我們衛生科的敎材遂取之不竭、用之不盡了、不過敎師不知曉的事情、千萬不要含糊過去、該請敎醫師解决、同時家長有意見、亦須請問敎師或醫師、弄得明明白白、休把「大槪」「差不多」「馬馬虎虎」害了兒童、</p>
<p>第二步驟選敎材</p>
<p>新須的課程標準、課程大綱、敎科用書、敎科内容、都可用這五種表的材料加以組織、就可適應、遴選敎材時、吾們當留神下列五個目標、</p>
<p>㈠適應兒童需要｜例如兒童牙齒坯、則須設法矯正、以應兒童的需要、</p>
<p>㈡增進兒童健康｜乘兒童有牙齒坯的時候、敎師當敎兒童保護牙齒和預防的方法、</p>
<p>㈢敎材要科學化｜這裏可分作三層講、</p>
<p>一、純粹科學化、譬若兒童每天喝幾「杯開水、到底四杯、六杯、抑八杯、我覺得定出幾杯來總有些不合、祗求適應兒童需要、一口渴開水、却毋庸强迫喝五杯十杯、才是眞正科學化、</p>
<p>二、似乎科學化、有人常常這樣說、打了霍亂預防針、包不生霍亂病、這裏「包」學、却生了　病、生活有　　、體格有强弱、針藥有良　、環境有善惡、試問如何可以「包」不生霍亂病、這豈非似乎科學而實不科學、</p>
<p>三、不科學化這倒很明顯的、舊社會裏常見的、什麽用符醫病、什麽求籤醫病、等等、敎師之於敎材、首要問科學不科學、看了上述三點、我們知道更易取舍了、</p>
<p>㈣敎材分量比例｜衛生敎育的目標在養成兒童習慣、智能、態度三項、低年生無須知道原則原理、因爲他們實在不會懂、故於智能的敎材、應該少些、而於習慣、則宜督促實行、不可放鬆的、對高年級則智能與習慣雙方該並重了、今姑定一比例在下面、</p>
<p>高年　中年　低年習慣百分之四十百分之五十百分之六十智能百分之四十百分之三十百分之二十態度百分之二十百分之二十百分之二十</p>
<p>㈤聯絡各科敎材｜衛生科應該那一種敎師担任、不消說級任敎師担任了材能勝任愉快、把這功課付託給級任敎師、那末各科敎材聯絡問題、自易能迎刄而解、課程標準施行辦法第五項規定「本標準頒布後、關於地方性的補充敎材、各縣市敎育局應卽組織地方敎材搜集委員會、依據本標準各科作業要項搜集各地方實際應用的鄉土敎材、作爲補充敎材、呈請主管敎育行政機關審核後、加入於具體敎材要目中」、那末衛生科也該仿此而行同樣的勿忘與各科聯絡例如地理科本鄉產物的滋養問題、自然科講到本地動植物而連帶到性敎育上問題、諸如此類、不勝枚舉、要在各人善自爲之、</p>
<p>第三步驟重活動</p>
<p>不定在課内尤屬低年級、衛生敎育的實施、大部要靠課我活動、當然、敎師要趨重聯絡兒童作種種活動、凡兒童一舉一動敎師該兒童化的參加進去、卽兒童到厠所用巾揩眼、洗鼻涕···敎師須隨時劉意、訓練的範圍極大、凡馬路上體育塲、試騐所、都是敎師從事衛生活動的良好地方、訓練的問題、包括㈠設計、㈡示範、㈢欣賞、㈣聯絡、㈤測騐、㈥練習、這些敎師該始終指導、</p>
<p>第四步驟查進度</p>
<p>調查兒童衛生習慣和態度等進度、係衛生敎學不可少的步驟、進度迅速分明是敎學得好、不然、馬上永改善、調查時應以客觀態度、兒童身心的好歹、都在其内了、用這五表對照一番、進度情形、不言可諭、兒童自己塡的表、更可給他們良好的剌戟、好比忘了牙刷、塡表時自會發生補刷牙齒的反應的、諸如此類、直接帮助兒童不少</p>
<p>小學特殊敎學法</p>
<p>應用了上述四個步驟、衛生敎育問題、可稱全部解决、現在我們再來補充些小學衛生敎育的特殊敎學法吧、</p>
<p>（一）晨間檢查｜諸位諒早知道這方法、這非特别事、也非早會、乃是一·調查兒童衛生、實施習慣、二·調查兒童清潔程度、三·調查急性病症、四·訓練兒童自己練習檢查、</p>
<p>（二）測量體重｜人類體重是没有標準的、所謂標準也者乃是假造的不科學的、我們的測量體重、目的要看出兒童身體重了多少、如一·看兒童發育進步情形、二·藉此兒童洞悉自己體重的進步、而引起健康的興趣、三·如體重不進步、而發現病症、則從速醫治、</p>
<p>（三）衛生自治｜兒童自治會、各小學多有設立、兒童自己做自己治、確是再好没有的事、衛生敎育往往由敎師醫師負完全責任、兒童坐觀其成、這是差誤的、假使交給兒童自己辦進步的效率、一定更易瞧見、從此我們可加以提倡、</p>

<p>— 瞻廬</p>
<p>雪是富有平等思想的，但看山上崎嶇的仄徑，高低的石磴，都被它塡平了，可見它最恨的是階級主義。</p>
<p>雪是最富有階級主義的，尤其是對於貧富階級顯分着一冷一暖，它只會侵入茅槍蔀屋中、替一般貧苦人家霜上加雪，雪上加霜，它不會侵入重簾繡幕的財主人家；便是偶爾侵入，經那電爐一烘，它也和那溫室中的暖氣做一家人而起着同化作用。</p>
<p>雪是清白無瑕的，任何清白物質的競賽會，誰也賽不過它，結果，總是它得着清白世界競賽會的錦標。</p>
<p>雪是藏垢納汚的，它只會替着五濁世界粉飾一種欺騙暫時的假面具；其實，它是很骯髒的，任何齷齪東西，都在它的兼容并包之下，結果，它也同流合汚的變了齷齪東西。</p>
<p>雪是富有創造性的，只須一夜工夫，人世不易見的瓊樓玉宇珙花瑤草，都是它一手包辦而成的，它確乎有創造天才。</p>
<p>雪是富有模仿性的，謝惠連雪賦上說的：「旣因方而爲珪，亦遇圓而成璧」它何嘗有創造天才，它只會因襲和模仿。</p>
<p>雪是和文人有緣的，無論新舊文人，都和它有特殊的感情；它也充分的給予文人作品上的便利。</p>
<p>雪是和武人有緣的，雪地行軍是戰略上常有的事，李愬雪夜人蔡州，便是確證武人和它有特殊的感情，它也給予武人行軍上的罕有機會。</p>
<p>雪是······</p>
<p>雪是······</p>

<p>— 須白石</p>
<p>｜也是一幅寫眞｜</p>
<p>朋友，在馬路上，提着一隻烏七八糟的小箱子，皮匠用的三脚橙，以及一方釘着白布的木框子，高高興興走着的，這是藝術家。</p>
<p>他們有一頭亂髮是有意弄亂的；他們儘有錢，却有意穿着這樣破而髒的衣服向外面跑。</p>
<p>這是爲的什麽？是爲的要做藝術家。他們出門大都帶着畫箱，表明他是畫家。他們常常出門不穿襪子，理由是，女人可以不穿襪子，爲何男子反而不能？况且我是藝術家······。</p>
<p>學校裏的課可以不上，每天可以到十點鐘起身：夜晚往往開夜車，用功的是寫情書。</p>
<p>把紅的綠的顏色亂塗在畫布上，似乎畫布就是一塊調色板；人家問他，他說，這是我的創作。而且他的創作力非常之强，像那樣的畫，他每天至少可以產生十幾幅。</p>
<p>他們的生活非常藝術化：有些穿了西裝不打領結；有的上身大衣下身短袴；嶄新的白皮鞋要自己加上些灰塵顏色後才套上脚，襪子髒了翻過來再穿幾天；畫服上更裝些小巧的圖案，或者畫一隻小貓，小狗；或者是一個骷髏，表示他在慨嘆着青春。</p>
<p>這是現代藝術家！現在中國的藝術家！嗚呼，我們能看見的是如此！</p>

<p>｜先來拆穿它一個｜</p>
<p>『西洋鏡，眞好玩，一個銅子看三看，但求一時不拆穿。』什麽是西洋鏡？現世的一切都可說是西洋鏡·因爲西洋鏡，全是假的，一拆穿便不値錢了；所以我說世上的一切都可謂之西洋鏡，即表示現世的一切都是虚僞的，欺騙的，讀者不信麽？請看我舉在下面的例子：</p>
<p>獨身主義</p>
<p>甲『異性是毒蛇，是要妨礙我的正事的進行的，因此我决不明知故犯，抱獨身主義了。』</p>
<p>乙『甲先生：昨天你不是說極誠意的請我和你介紹一位異性麽？怎麽現在又這樣說，那眞使我百思而不得其解了。』</p>
<p>丙『乙先生：你又何必這樣認眞呢？｜飲食男女，人之大慾存焉｜本來人生在世，那個願意抱獨身主義呢？不過他因爲至今還没有找到愛人，所以在衆人面前這樣說啊！』</p>

<p>— 持佛</p>
<p>｜花樣很多｜</p>
<p>妓女有很悠久的歷史；管夷吾設三百女閭，以便行商，這不是今日妓院的里巷麽？論語說：『齊人饋女樂』。漢武帝創設營妓，以待軍士們没有妻室的。到了宋代，營妓之制，依然存在。東坡居士道：『杭州營籍周韶，多蓄奇茗，常與君謨｜蔡襄的字｜鬭勝之。又知作詩，子容過杭，述古飲之。韶汶求落籍，捧筆成一絶曰：『隴上巢空歲月驚，忍看回首自梳翖；開籠若放雪衣女，長念觀音般若經』。韶時有服衣白，一坐嗟嘆』。不但這樣，東漢時候，馬融設了絳帳，是位經術大師，前授生徒，後列女樂。從這樣說來，古來妓女與軍，士，商各界，都發生了密切的關繫。不但中國這樣，東西各國，那一國没有妓女。便把日本來說，種類也是很多，不妨略舉數種吧。</p>
<p>妓女的名稱很多：爲什麽呌做『婊子』呢？婊是外婦的意思，說不是正式的渾家。爲什麽呌做『倡婦』呢？倡和唱通，便是古時候的女樂。爲什麽呌做『妓女』呢？妓是技的意思，猶如日本的『藝者』和『舞子』一般。我國妓女的名稱很多，還有甚麽公倡，私倡，長三，么二，淌牌，野雞，日本也是一般的呀。</p>
<p>日本最高等的妓女，呌做『藝者』；譬如我國從前的清倌人。宋代的李師師，明代的董小苑，李香君，柳如是，陳圓圓等也許有些相像。要是眞個銷魂，費了數千百元，有時恐怕還辦不到呢。東京如日本橋·新橋·日山下·九段坂·神樂坂等地方，都是伊們的香巢。伊們居處富麗，衣服裝飾，也窮奢極侈。從前有一藝者，遺失一隻鑽戒，價値一萬八千元，如此一端，可見伊們的奢華了。</p>
<p>日本的娼妓，也有公私之分；私的姑且慢說；公的，所住的地方，呌做『娼樓』，譬如我國所說的『青樓』『敎坊』『窰子』『倡門』一般。老鴇呌做『敵娼』，又呌做『相手』；龜奴也呌做『相手』。游資呌做『席料』，又呌做『湯代』。至於費用，以時間計算，約每小時自一元五角至六元不等，倒很像大中學敎師的束脩</p>
<p>又有『酌婦』，譬如我國的女堂倌，不過日本是料理店｜菜館｜裏所雇用，專爲客侑酒的。又有『舞子』，大槪多是十幾歲的少女，譬如我國××歌舞團中的舞女，和江湖賣解女兒一般；和跳無塲裏的舞女，有些不同了。</p>

<p>吃飽了飯，每天無事，便和他們夫婦倆，隨意談笑取樂，旣不拘泥；也不客氣，逢到高興，就帮他們料量一些瑣碎的家務，飼飼金魚；澆澆花草；或者記記零用賬：整理整理陳設；再不然就到書架上去找尋他的良伴。有時小曼見他太閑，怕他悶出病來，就向他說；『你眞懶；吃飽飯，一些事不想做，架子上的鸚鵡，快要餓死了再這樣懶，明天就派你去放牛。嘿！你當心···』再或有時，他偶然有了感觸，引動了心底的舊創，只要眉心略略一皺，被東方生一看見，立刻就要調笑似的說：『呵呵！今天是什麽節氣呀？這孩子老毛病又發了。小曼，來，我踏琴，你來唱支短歌兒，大家來替這孩子醫病···。』這麽一來，他的愁悶，頓被那一片歡笑；和曼妙的琴聲歌韻，驅送到了烏何有之鄕。</p>
<p>像這種不着色彩的生活，平凡而並不單調；幽靜而並不寂寞。僅僅三四個月後，他覺得所處的世界，好像換了一個世界：身體也像換了一個身體，心底的傷痕，逐漸平復；已喪失的人生勇氣；也逐漸活躍，終至於外表的容光，也逐漸豐滿，除了偶然想起他的後母；和以前的處境，一切都覺幸福。</p>
<p>不過這種淡而雋永的幸福空氣中，有一件事，每每使他生出不快。他自覺對於東方生，在先，旣没有特殊的恩惠，往後，也難期適當的酬報。長此叨擾人家，人家能永不厭憎嗎？就使人家能永不厭憎，自己的良心上，也過不起。此念一動，他往往忍不住向着東方生，忸怩不安地說：『我我···我終不成永久···』</p>
<p>逢到這種時候，他的話，還未及說完，東方生總是淡然一笑，好像已窺透他的心事，馬上阻止他說；『小東西，不許說了。你無論說什麽，我都願聽，我只不願意聽你此刻藏在喉嚨口的一句話。』這樣的話，無異是關了門下了閂，於是他又只得忸怩而中止。天眞的小曼，尤其乖覺，每逢他表示心中不過意的時候，伊就嬉笑地說：『我們以前，很嫌我們這個環境，太覺枯寂，因此我們二人十分希望，跳出一個小孩子來，調劑一下。無如期待了好久，終於失望，這是何等的不幸呀！此刻你旣來了。使我們這枯窘的家庭，平添了不少生趣，你不妨就算補了這小孩的缺，豈不好呢？（八）</p>
<h3 id="c181">上海夜話 <a href="#c181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>— 張若春</p>
<p>（一）霞飛路</p>
<p>霞飛路，是上海法租界最富於南歐風味的一條街道，像一條五色斑爛的長蛇，從山仙橋起，一直蜿蜒到海格路，兩旁種栽樹木，春夏秋季，綠葉成蔭，一片青翠欲滴的顏色，可以使走路的人感到一種愉快舒適的印像。</p>
<p>黃昏時分，從呂班路到亞爾培路的一段，在平坦光滑的人行道上，三三五五的青年男女：黑眼睛，黃頭髮，高鼻子，紅嘴唇，有没落的白俄貴族，有退伍的契丹政客，有上海的摩豋伽女，徘徊散步，流覧商店魅惑的窗飾。戀人兒，一對對從影戲院出來，手挽看手，向咖啡館進去。也有獨身的男人，漫步向着幽靜的住宅區走去，在夜色朦朧中，仰頭看路旁整潔的洋房，從輕薄的紗窗簾，射出顏色的燈光，漏出一角紅樓，這是多麽富於詩的情趣景色吓。</p>
<p>在霞飛路的兩旁，住的白俄男女，反多於法蘭西人。在法租界内，說俄國話的有一萬多人，說法國話的不到二千人，但這一千多個的法國僑民，却統治着五十多萬的中國人，法國僑民的生活，自然應該優秀高貴的了。</p>
<p>霞飛路，白俄的僑民，在他們中間，都喜歡稱它做尼古拉路；拉黃包車的江北人，呌它寳昌路；少數喜歡過上海夜生活的中國人，從一二八事變後，稱它爲『神秘之街』；法蘭西民主共和國的國民，則仍舊稱它做霞飛路。</p>
<p>每年七月十四日的法國國慶節，在霞飛路上出提燈會的和看熱閙的，可以說完全是中國人。法國各洋行的高等商人，都躱在邁爾西愛路的法國總會裏，通宵達旦地飲酒狂無；法國兵，則都聚集在本隊營房，或朱葆三路的舞塲裏暢情狂歡。</p>
<p>十數年前，歡迎霞飛上將到上海的時候，法租界萬人空巷，爭到『霞飛路上看霞飛』，也完全是中國人在替法國人撑塲面。</p>
<p>上海第一家富麗的影戲院，國泰戲院的摩豋建築，便築在霞飛路。最風凉的花園咖啡座，和屋頂咖啡座，也設在霞飛路。（可惜今年，「文藝復興」和「泰加欽谷，」都先後休閉了。）最富於神秘性和異國情調的半夜舞塲：「黑眼睛」和「新夏威夷，」也在霞飛路。從前在北四川路靶子路一帶林立的按摩院，常常引起一般人好奇心的神秘之窟，也都搬到霞飛路來了。</p>
<p>霞飛路，是一條富於異國情調的街道，是東方的尼古拉路，也是新興的神秘之路。</p>
<h3 id="c182">君子國 <a href="#c182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>

<p>碧眼黃髯者稱我們貴同胞是「東亞病夫。」</p>
<p>其實，這是錯了，無怪要引起我們的大人先生們的大聲反對，因爲，不必說别的，那名詞就够引起我們大人先生的惡感，雖然，我們大人先生是獨多彎腰屈背之流，但是，你該知道，我們的大人先生最諱莫如深的是指出他的弱點。</p>
<p>所以照我的管見，該改作「君子國」纔對，這樣，名詞是多麽的動聽；名正則言順，｜雖然賊伯伯也會「掠美。」說什麽「樑上君子，」但是那是無傷大雅的，｜三家村的村學究也會深然我說，說「順我者昌，逆我者亡，有此堂堂之鼓，正正之旗，何所不克！」内容，那是不必深究的，我們的大人先生們祗要有一個動聽的名詞就够了。至於是僞君子，是眞君子還是癮君子？吹皺一池春水，千卿底事！</p>

<p>空方掉期越貼越大</p>
<p>三月份標金上塲即軋小</p>
<p>空方急貼無奈多方絶少</p>
<p>貼價由五錢加至二兩半</p>
<p>最後站在二兩二三錢間</p>
<p>（掉期前後之市塲形勢）昨市標金外電倫敦大條雖微跌○六二五、仍開低盤、蓋美銀長一二五、遠期銀價亦見微升數毫、並因掉期空方貼出、三月份上塲理應軋小、故晨開三月期爲七百九十八兩五錢、二月期七百九十九兩七錢、相差一兩二錢、此卽謂掉期掛牌、嗣後空方急於貼出、而多方已告絶跡、貼價愈高、標金價亦隨之而升至七百九十九兩半、二月期八百兩○○七錢、匯豐掛牌俱升一二五、匯市略見轉硬、加之有利於銀市之消息傳來、金價漸降、其間雖由中央開現而回升、但未幾仍跌降爲七百九十三兩六錢、蓋銀行做正月份下半月美金一二五、四月份三一二五、無人問津、午後先因匯豐吃三月份美金二五而往上、後更以本月份二十八元五月份三一二五銀行均要結而至九十七兩外、中央銀行再來開現、而至八兩六錢、入後匯市仍平、乃以七百九十七兩三錢收盤、掉期初做多方貼進七錢、後爲五錢、乃一路趨高、曾做過二兩半光景最後似在二兩二三錢間站住、多方除中央銀行及現貨號略有頭寸外、已不多見、今將前後市情形記後、</p>
<p>（晨市跟貼價上下）晨開卽低、計三月份開盤七百九十八兩五錢、源康祥及物品售條、（物品開盤七百九十七兩五錢）漸降至六兩五錢、蓋此際皆注意於掉期、及至多方恒興已經掉齊、空方急增價而貼、大德成恒餘乃來購條、升至八兩外、銀行此時亦已開盤、英匯近期出價一先令八便士、美金二十八元、祗略硬○六二五、銀行私電亦微加○六二五、大德成續進、乃爲九兩半、福順屢出、爲七兩半、匯市稍硬、三月美金一八七五不能售出、大興永元春源茂永等來出、退至五兩四錢、丙興源茂永在此際稍有脫售、而恒餘則進、好至七兩、匯豐掛牌揭曉英美俱長一二五、略見下降、爲六兩半、元亨路進、價乃盤旋而上、恒興亦購、而爲八兩半、永豐則出、降至七兩二錢、此間源茂永福餘賣出、恒興恒餘則進、華比三井俱吃二五四月份美金、再見八兩四錢、略見徘徊、而匯市變幻極快、二五四月份忽不能售去、恒餘乃來脫手、降至六兩内、義豐永亦出、慶發永則進、在五兩半間拉住、恒興代中央開現、進至六兩四錢、此後雖連進多次、但價未見上騰、蓋四月份美金已做二一二五、志豐永亦於此際購條、聞係代大豐恒開現者、乃見盤旋於六兩左右、及至四月份雖三一二五亦不易售出、元春源康祥大興永競售、而爲三兩七錢、旋升上四錢、最後因中央售正月份下半月美金一二五、而降至九十三兩六錢、未幾卽以此價收盤、收市後聞匯市尙見較佳之成交、元亨卽來猛購、曾到過四兩半之十、物品則早已拍三兩五錢收市、</p>
<p>（結局下跌三兩七）後市承午後之餘風、開盤跳起一兩一錢、爲七百九十四兩七錢、散户脫售、而爲四兩一錢、匯豐吃三月份美金二五、而漲至五兩、福餘稍購、爲五兩二三錢、宏利亦進至六兩外、大德成在六兩二錢限價待售、乃稍盤旋、無如福餘買意極濃、漲爲六兩七錢、支豐永亦來爭購、跳爲七兩二錢、益豐售出、稍見盤低、爲六兩一錢、此後漸入佳境、正月美金念八元、五月三一二五銀行均要、永豐進至七兩半、三井吃四月份三一二五、義豐永大德成進至八兩、兆豐昌購條、乃至八兩六錢、略見盤旋、蓋散户及物品稍出、旋爲七兩半、乾昌祥進至八兩外、恒興代中央進現、大德成亦購、爲八兩四錢、此後大德成雖在八兩内限價欲購、但以匯市四月份美金二五不能售而反趨下游、徘徊於七兩半之間較久、三月份一八七五銀行　做、同行中欲售而缺乏買户、價續下游、恒餘來賣、乃爲六兩光景、大興永慶發永則傾、乃盤旋而再見九十七兩八錢、此時已近收市、買賣已不見多、最後卽以七百九十七兩三錢收盤、物品以多方猛抬、而拍七百九十八兩半、（雙揭價）查一日間最高價七百九十九兩五錢、最低價七百九十三兩六錢、有五兩九錢徘徊、結果昨上週末跌下三兩七錢</p>

<p>結束忙交易淡空盤出現</p>
<p>紗市極其散慢、一無振作之氣、以廢曆歲暮將近、各方忙於結束、營業範圍緊縮、因之交易頗靜、升降極微、時有空盤　出、但一部份以海外花紗較穩、對於遠月明年之貨、心思觀高、而東北戰雲瀰漫、金融受其影響不淺、</p>
<p>（人標升降力量薄）人標前市開盤、以美棉平疲、而金價趨短、人心較弱、各月跌一·二·四錢、午後間實需雖滯、然長豐號購進有一千三百包、致塲中市氣較緊、各月回漲一·二·四錢、全日成交統計九千九百包、查賣出森康八百五十包、愼記三百五十包、遠大六百五十包、椿記五百包、買進長豐一千三百五十包、信誠六百五十包、大昶三百包、茲將收盤價列下、</p>

<p>｜遠期亦因之帶起一些｜</p>
<p>棉市始疲繼堅、美棉平靜、金價又趨下游、致人心略萎、惟本月份某廠商將空額稍稍抵進、市氣較穩、遠月激昂一點、然交易仍少、查市上多數心理看好、以雨霉連綿、内地河水冰凍、運輸艱難云、</p>
<p>（穩的鄭標）鄭標前市開盤、隨外棉而疲、塲中交易較清各月跌五分至一錢半、午後以大空頭抵補本月份、遠月帶起、各月均漲一錢至一錢半、全日成交統計二萬六千八百擔、查賣出椿記二千六百擔、穗隆一千二百擔、遠大一千三百擔、源大八百擔、吉豐七百擔、買進恒德一千一百擔、仁豐一千二百擔、益昶一千四百擔、長豐八千一百擔、大昶一千擔、收盤價如下、</p>

<p>（滬南）昨因天雨、來船祇六十餘號、去胃零躉呆滯、致市慘落、蘇同帮價跌三四角、南港青角常帮等白粳及薄稻相繼修削二三角不等、惟杜洋尖乏貨尙能挺立、變陰元以應時胃香、故稍帶軟色耳、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨日河下來船三十來號、白粳早市零星略化、午市店胃繞殷、市形短去二角、因天雨不止、斛出無幾、薄粳早稻來源續有、零銷交平、市形小去二三角、羊埠尖到銷兩平、市趨定勢、杜尖高貨乏到、中次稍有、走化呆滯、價小尺外、陰變元到雖不旺、零胃平常、價又小二三角、</p>

<p>客秈銷呆看平</p>
<p>昨日客秈市况、受河下杜米湧到價落之影響、進户觀望、意在擯小、而貨主則因成本高昂、存到兩少、不肯眨價出售、因此湘省秈元各米、隨至擯不售開、下午泉州帮辦去高贛晚四百五十包、贛晚存底更稀、價乃得站住、</p>
<p>洋米市况久寂、存底尙有三十多萬包、但均在洋商手中、不肯出售、惟外洋電訊、　步報小、昨日元利洋行來電一號西貢四兩三錢五分、三四月份貨、合申市祇九元二角左右、而目下申市現貨須九元半、故又有合划之可能、惟米商去今兩年因洋米而受虧甚鉅、雖可合划、均有談虎色變、未敢問津云、</p>

<p>福新定澳麥一船半祇三兩六錢七</p>
<p>粉市大致疲落無神、洋麥報價、續小二角左右、至近遠期之人心、目下亦已轉變、本月份雖現貨仍缺、惟客帮則有回出、因接連辦裝、已告停頓、遠期各月份、則因洋麥又接連成交、數量甚巨、（前週六成交一船聞達九千噸三月裝船價三兩七錢）昨則聞福新又定澳麥一船半、三月裝船、價改廉至三兩六錢七分、洋麥之傾銷、依然如舊、致人心遂又皇皇不安、兼之年關之故、買户轉寂、市氣更覺寂寞不堪、結果本月份較前週跌一分半、二月份跌一分三月份跌一分二厘半、四月份跌一分半、五月份跌一分二厘半、六月份跌一分七厘半、</p>
<p>麥市一致呈銳落之象、以洋麥報價、續小二角零、一般浮多、自然虚軟、各月份之跌度、尤以三月份爲更甚、因各月份之情形、各有不同、本月份因新近有洋麥進口、行家之定貨、好預備交割、（現泊三四號浮筒）人心因此軟落、遠期則因洋麥仍逐有成交、價步呈廉宜、此種情形、均易打動多頭之心理、所以各月份開價卽不見振、後步如套頭一湧、或者仍易變動也、結果本月份微好一分、二月份跌三分、三月份跌五分、四月份跌五分、又據十四日芝加哥電小麥、因利物浦市塲軟弱、及出口需要不良、跌○·五至○·七五分、又十三日成交共二千萬蒲歇爾、茲將行市列左、</p>

<p>— 瘦鵑</p>
<p>師父喝一口白干兒，話匣子　；「咱們窮人祇要　耐　，正　見做，「皇天不負苦心人！」總不愁會餓死的！大毛，你没知道！咱小時候才比你苦呢！咱六歲　上死爺！十歲又死　！落得個光身子，無親無友，家裏又没有留下一點食糧！虧得隔壁家王伯伯，　着咱苦，要了咱他家去看牛，咱就在他們家住二三年，十三歲上王伯伯荐咱到鎭裏茂昌　匠店做學徒，咱才學上這一手苦行業！後來師父瞧咱做事肯耐苦！心眼兒正！就把他女兒嫁給路哩！但過了幾年，茂昌因爲生意輕，關閉了，就在那一年，阿珍的媽又死哩！這一年該是咱交落塘運！直灰心得什麽事全不想做，後來還是因爲瞧着阿珍太可憐，才每天替人做帮工！幾年來好容易掙下一點錢，苦苦的開了這麽一家店，現在總算大家混得一口飯吃！瞧着阿珍一天一天長得中人意起來，自家兒就也夠歡心的！」</p>
<p>師父又喝一口白干兒，眼瞧到女兒，女兒默然，乖乖的坐下灶邊燒火了，師父的眼光轉落到咱臉上。</p>
<p>「祇是咱没有一個兒子；祇要大毛乖，做事有勁兒，咱把阿珍嫁給你，兩口兒倒也很配呢！」</p>
<p>咱一樂，險些兒菜刀切上手指，瞧阿珍，阿珍紅着膾，低着頭。</p>
<p>「笑呢」！</p>
<p>家兒的心　裏才眞笑呢！</p>
<p>有一天早上，師父要上街裏去，他說近來各處鄉間水災，大兵打仗，又不時過境，附近的下人死的死，走的走，那些田全荒棄，咱們店裏每年秋季做出的那一大堆　刀呀，　呀，　呀，······今兒一點没銷路，所以師父發愁，要自家兒上街去呌賣。</p>
<p>師父走後，咱和師妹在房子裏滾　子玩。</p>
<p>咱的銅子打姆指　　抛下，骨落落直滾到門檻邊。阿珍没留心，平面落下，祇拍一聲跳上幾寸遠。</p>
<p>「刮刀拔！不算！不算！」咱正要拿　子打，阿珍却拾起　子撒嬌着賴：「賴呢！咱不來，」咱一個火心就往外走。</p>
<p>「來呢！來呢！」阿珍急得忙招手。</p>
<p>「遠賴不賴？」</p>
<p>「不賴了！」</p>
<p>咱回進來，阿珍的腮幫兒鼓得紅紅的！兩顆眼珠子直瞧進咱心窩裏。</p>
<p>「羞呢！贏自家人的錢！」</p>
<p>太陽照進咱店堂，師父回來，後邊兒跟着一個戴西瓜皮小帽穿反領皮大衣的中年男子。</p>
<p>師父說，「這是春太爺家的六三大叔，春太爺特地呌他咱家來選買幾樣嫁具的！大毛！給大叔倒茶！」</p>
<p>咱倒一盃茶雙手送在那小子面前，那小子却正眼兒也不瞧咱一下，一雙眼珠子儘烏溜溜的釘住阿珍。（未完）</p>

<p>— 子穀</p>
<p>誰都知道自九一八以來日本帝國主義者對我國變本加厲的侵略暴行，是以空前的世界經濟恐慌之狂潮爲其「動力」，只有昏庸愚昧者才認爲是由於少數日本軍閥的盲動，或是偶然的不幸事件。誰都知道我們對於日帝國主義者的侵略暴行，除了全國總動員以自力謀自衛自救而外，决無第二條路可走，只有怯弱畏葸者才認爲不抵抗可以博取世界之同情，爭得最後之勝利。事實是嶄然如鐵：日本的侵略暴行，自九一八以來，是有增無已，而我們的不抵抗政策，也恰爲坐待宰割，瞑目等死。時至今日，再不覺悟，更復何待？</p>
<p>而且，最近列强對日的輿論，更很顯然的爲日本張目。英國的政府輿論機關說：「我們從前的同盟者正在爲世界而犧牲，在預備着和蘇聯决戰，華北的事情，我們應該帮忙，不應該干涉」。法國的輿論界則只是忙着聲明「法日同盟」「法日密約」並非事實，而對事實的本體，不加評論。意大利則更說得好；「管他媽的，讓東方人自家殺一陣也好」。這便是世界的「輿論」也便是我們從九一八以來呼籲哀求的收穫。事實是已經明白地指出：在經濟恐慌之狂潮冲激下，爲了掙扎其最後的運命，帝國主義者的步調業已一致。雖說她們相互間的矛盾也日益尖銳化，但對於「另一種爭鬭」與對於弱小民族的宰割，則是永永站在一條戰線上的。</p>
<p>所以目前我們决再不容向魔鬼乞憐，更决不容長此安坐等死，我們只有發動民族革命的戰爭，爲自己以及世界的前途向强敵作殊死戰。我們不要以爲這種爭海海的應聲，因爲，我們也自有我們的「聯合戰線」。</p>

<h3 id="c230">蘇聯的演劇 <a href="#c230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>— 趙銘彝</p>
<p>蘇聯的演劇，是和社會主義建設分不開的。換句話說，卽是：演劇在蘇聯，也是社會主義建設的一部分。</p>
<p>在第一五年計劃以前，蘇聯演劇的内容，是運用着非常刺激的，破壞的題材底劇本，當時演劇主要的課題，是明白地指出革命對於無產階級解放的重要；但從五年計劃一開始，無產階級就自己起來創造藝術的新形式了，從前他們只不過是一個被動的觀客，現在則成爲藝術創造自動的參加者了。</p>
<p>把第一五年計劃實施過程中演劇的目錄拿來一看，我們就發現許多都是採取當前的，某一特殊產業部門或文化部門的五年計劃作題材，來描寫他們間的生產的落後，技術的缺乏，以及取消主義者的陰謀破壞，怎樣方達到預定的成功或者超過等問題，特别是重工業部門的發展，農業集體化，文盲撲滅等運動，演劇是負擔起他的戰鬥任務的。</p>
<p>現在我們且舉一個例子來說明。在蘇聯的舞台上，曾經演過下面這樣的故事。</p>
<p>幕開時，台上是一片荒凉的土地，農人們都拿着舊式的農具在那兒開墾，他們間，有一部分的人在那兒埋怨，於是一位托洛茲基主義者就宣傳他們說，要使農業也實施社會主義，是絶對不可能的事，於是有許多人跟著動搖，悲觀起來。在這羣農人中間的青年突擊隊員們，他們是從先就主張用耕種機來開墾的，可是一般頑固的傢伙，無論怎樣也不相信這理由的眞實，這時候，那些青年們就提議向政府借用耕種機，在大家失望的時候，這提議無可奈何地通過了。</p>
<p>於是舞台塲面一轉，一架龐大的Ｔractor橫過舞台，新的土地開墾了。到結尾的時候，一片金黃色的麥子呈現在觀衆的面前，大家歡喚起來。人勝利了，心勝利了，社會主義的建設得以進行。</p>
<p>○　○　○　○　○</p>
<p>五年計劃在蘇聯演劇上還有一種特殊的產物，那就是特拉姆（Ｔram青年工人劇團）。特拉姆在演劇的形式和内容上和從前是兩樣，在意德沃羅基上也是完全不同，他是把握住辯證法唯物論作牠的活動基礎。就是，一切的演劇活動，都必須是唯物的，辯證的發展。所以牠們能夠直接帮助了「五年計劃，四年完成」的工作，克服了許多生產上重要的困難。</p>
<p>現在第二五年計劃又在開始了，在這中間，蘇聯演劇的主要目標是：㈠消滅城市和鄉村的不平衡和對立，建立多數的鄉村劇塲，組織更多的突擊劇團，鼓動宣傳隊（ＡgitProp）；㈡把許多落後民族的文化提到最高度；㈢澈底地消滅資本主義殘餘，消滅人對人的剝削關係。｜｜這當然是和整個計劃一致的。</p>

<p>— 張資平</p>
<p>無論怎樣都難否定兩人間的感情是戀愛了。假如讓這種戀愛程度深進下去，是異常危險的。自己無論如何，縱令不爲自己，也要爲佩珠保持此身的純潔。我這身上的血液是絶對純潔的！除掉自己的愛的對象，崇高而清麗的佩珠以外，自己的純潔决不能爲其他的女性而解放。縱令卓淑華那個純貞的女子來向自己挑戰，自己仍須積極的抵抗，長期的抵抗！何况對於族類不同，並且是自己的父執的姨太太，又歲數又快近三十的中年女性的鶴子，縱令不能嚴固自己的國防，也不可以藩籬盡撤。假如自己仍存這個不高尙的念頭，那末，自己便是不中用的墮落份子！自己是堂堂的中華男兒，應當堅强地保持一下黃帝子孫神明胄裔的名譽吧！······</p>
<p>海泉想到這裏，便無意識地緊揑着拳頭向片己的頭部搥了三下。</p>
<p>「縱令不是父執的姨太太，縱令不是中年的女性，縱令是像那一個美麗的日本姑娘，自己也該維持下中華大國民的身分，不該就那樣容易陷落下去，給日本小鬼看輕！······」</p>
<p>他胡思亂想了一會，鶴子夫人化妝得比剛才更加動人，也換上了她所最賞識的入時的服裝，笑吟吟的走進他的房裏來了。海泉一看見她，胸口又砰砰的跳動起來，剛才振作起來的」中華魂」，又似乎要在鶴子夫人的美麗的姿態中消溶下去了。</p>
<p>「啊呀，娘姨還没有把早點送上來麽？」</p>
<p>她笑着問他。最初是態度正經的，但說了後，又笑了起來了。一看見她笑，他的週身便要軟化了一樣。</p>
<p>「不中用！自己還是不中用！自己的精神實在是軟弱！」</p>
<p>不一刻，娘姨送了兩份早點上來了。</p>
<p>「從今早上起，我每餐都要陪着林先生吃飯了。不許林先生到外面去吃了」！</p>
<p>她像撒嬌般地說。</p>
<p>「他們呢」？</p>
<p>海泉還是關心着那個日本佬和那個日本小姑娘。</p>
<p>「不管他們！呌娘姨送給他們了」！</p>

<h3 id="c232">欺騙與利用 <a href="#c232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>— 枕流</p>
<p>「欺騙，利用，」四字，外國人是有時用來做國際政治上競爭，爲一國謀利益的：中國人是老用對内流行，以謀個人利益的，相形之下，實有天淵之别！我們該會記得歐戰時候，威爾遜說：「打破德意志的武力統一世界的迷夢，是爲世界求和平，爲弱小民族求解放」的漂亮話，以鼓動弱小民族的心靈，於是弱小民族則認威氏的語，是眞實的，所以各弱小民族都毅然誠意加入協約國的戰線，對德作戰，結果德國戰敗，歐戰告終，不僅戰勝的帝國主義不給弱小民族自决自主；反而組織國際聯盟，爲帝國主義的大本營，以支配弱小民族，重行分贓與宰割，使弱小民族永遠貼伏在他們鐵蹄之下，没有翻身出頭的日子。可見帝國主義者，全在站在一國利益的立塲上，而欺騙利用弱小民族的，是毫無疑義。</p>
<p>我們再進一步觀察，自九一八事件，到了現在，已有年餘，暴日侵略，還是節節向我國内地逼迫，國聯怎有制裁暴日的决心呢？不道此次國聯表面上邀請美俄出席，共商中日問題，按其實質上，是利用美俄出席國聯爲遠東和平的表示，使美俄無形打消進攻日本的策略，而無形欺騙中國政府的妙計。然而我　　請誦南無阿彌陀佛或千遍或百遍或十遍當獲現世十種功德</p>
<p>葉勁風先生鑒尊寓地址已忘無從函達請見報即駕臨申報館一談姚子初啟</p>
<p>們各位要人，還清歌於漏舟之中，高談闊論，以欺騙全國民衆，互相利用，以鞏固個人地位，只是尸位素餐，而置國家與度外，「上失其道，民散久矣」弄得中國一團糟糕，不可收拾，推其原因；我們存心做事的少，存心做官的多，爲民衆謀利益的少，利用民衆的多；上行下效，沿習成風，以權利相爭，而求滿足個人升官發財的希望，致釀成軍閥和官僚化的中國，欺騙和虚僞的社會，爾詐我虞，鈎心鬥角，正是自掘墳墓，自招滅亡。</p>
<p>然則往者已矣，來者可追，我們今後應有洗面革心，努力創造眞實的社會，掃除欺騙和利用的惡病，陶鑄每一個人都有國而忘家，有公而忘私的心理，有毁家紓難的觀念，雖國家到了破釜沉舟的時候，我們必行同舟共濟，轉危爲安，而慈航達岸的。深望我們同朡「三思」！</p>

<h3 id="c234">談談牛乳 <a href="#c234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>— 新</p>
<p>「牛乳」我們早已認爲頗富於滋養的食品之一，尤其是歐美人士，幾無日不需之。普通分爲三種；新鮮牛乳，罐頭煉乳和乳粉。現以其分述之：</p>
<p>新鮮牛乳</p>
<p>牛乳之成分　欲知牛乳於人生營養之關係，須先明瞭其成分。新鮮牛乳者，剛自母牛乳房捋取，作白色乳液。比重約爲一·○三三。含有水分８４％；牛酪Ｂutter４％酪素Ｃaseine５％，乳糖５％。此外並有少量之無機鹽類（如燐酸鈣）活力素（又名唯他命）Ａ及Ｄ；幾種有益於我人消化之酵母，如ＴrypsinePepsine,Lipase。牛乳中並溶有氣體（如氱氣，淡氣等）。</p>
<p>牛乳與人體營養之關係　我人需要之食物中，不外脂肪，糖類，蛋白質，和不可缺少之活力素。我們旣知牛乳之成份如上，立刻承認牛乳爲富有滋養之物。蓋人體所需者，牛乳幾全有之；脂肪有牛酪，糖類有乳糖，蛋白質有酪素，並有二種活力素，及對於骨酪有重要關係之　酸鈣。再者，我人所食之物，能得消化而供身體之吸收，多藉相當酵母之力。Ｌipase能消化脂肪Ｐepsine在胃中有鹽酸之環境下，助以消化蛋白質成𠼞基酸ＡminoAcids則腸能吸收；而�</p>
<p>Ｔrypsine亦能助以消化蛋白質，但無須鹽酸之幫助。綜觀以上諸點，牛乳之認爲頗有滋養，誰曰不然。</p>
<p>牛乳久露空間，其味發酸，同時酸素即受酸性之應響，即凝集成塊；此乃因空中之一種酵素，名ＬacticＦerment者，使乳糖受氱化而成乳酸之故。且空間微生蟲甚多，牛乳對於菌類之生長頗適宜，故易壞。</p>
<p>牛乳中旣含有酵母及活力素，故食時，不宜熱之溫度過高，否則，其所含之活力素，及酵母，皆將消毁；其滋養力之减少，無容疑擬。但恐牛乳中含有細菌之類，則宜煑之沸騰，以免傳染。</p>
<p>消毒牛乳　牛乳旣爲直接供飮之物，則其不潔即能傳受疾病。且我人知者供乳之牛有病，其乳中常含有病菌。最普通而危險者，莫如結核菌ＭycobaeteriumＴuberculosis。此病牛中患者過半數。故欲免此危險，牛奶棚中即以牛乳消毒後出售之。因之市上常見「Ａ」字牛乳消毒牛乳Ｐasuetrized牛乳等所謂Ｐasteurized牛乳者，即用Ｐasteur氏之高壓蒸氣消毒法消毒之謂。「Ａ」字牛乳即牛乳之已經消毒，工部局騐爲上等之牛乳。消毒法有二，其一即高壓蒸氣消毒，以牛乳置一消毒鍋中，用高壓蒸氣通入。另一消毒法即低壓消毒法。此法即將牛乳置低氣壓中消毒，換言之，因氣壓减小，無須用高溫度就能消毒，故對於牛乳固有之成分，無甚變化。</p>
<p>煉乳</p>
<p>普通之煉乳，多作黃白色之黏性物，裝於罐中，味甚甜。其製法，即以新鮮牛乳，用熱或蒸氣濃縮之；並加蔗糖以增甜味。因蒸去之水分無一定，其成分不能推算準確。普通煉乳中之水分祗２６％其他成分之百分率因之增高。牛酪９５％，酪素１０％，乳糖１６％，而蔗糖有０４％左右之多；故煉乳供飲時，須冲水使其成分與新鮮牛乳同。</p>
<p>煉乳固於使用及保存，便利不少，尤以旅行者稱便；但因用熱度濃縮故，其中活力素及有益之酵母，早已消失。且若盛此煉乳之罐頭金屬中，有鉛等毒物者，能使煉乳變成不合於衛生之品。</p>
<p>乳粉</p>
<p>乳粉，因其携帶便利，用者甚多，乳粉之製法，即以新鮮牛乳，用較低之溫度蒸發至乾，頗費時間。乳粉之各成分當然，更較煉乳中所含者爲多，但欲得一美觀而潤滑輕燥之乳粉，常將其一部，或全部牛酪除去，則可避免乳粉之凝結成塊，故其成分實無一定。因之其滋養之力若何，又莫能規定，並且乳粉中，常加防腐劑，以防發酵，變壞，要知無論何種防腐劑，皆不宜於人身。故用乳粉者須審愼之。</p>

<p>夜深了，雪仍不停地下着，堆積在院子裏有三寸多厚，白皚皚地發亮，瘋狂的北風猖獗地施着虎威，括得外重窗子軋軋地響，屋子裏生着團爐，元术一家人圍着爐，談戰事緊急的消息，爐上擺着的一隻水壼潑剌剌地滾了，元术把水壼的蓋子除了。</p>
<p>「爸爸！今天這裏又到了好多義勇軍」！元术的兒子瑯說，年紀已經十八歲了。</p>
<p>「督！督！督！」外面有人敲門，當差的把門開了，走進來一個人。</p>
<p>「在下奉團長之命，代表到此；請求大爺，准許不割柳樹墩的高梁，俾便利軍事行動。」</p>
<p>「您坐下，我們好說話」，元术親自端了一隻凳子給那人坐。「不割可以，你們現在有多少同志在這裏？」</p>
<p>「不多，大約只有三百，咱們奉上司之命，急急來此抗敵，所以子彈缺乏，糧食不足，請大爺帮忙！」</p>
<p>「是！這位大哥說的是，我們要爲國爲己，爸爸！眼望着敵人打到這裏來了，我們義勇軍無彈無糧，怎好抵抗！我們愉快的家庭是建築在國家上的，國亡，我們愉快的家庭也將没有了，骨肉離散，······還有，亡國奴的臭名和恥辱······爸爸！我們救國！就是救自己！自然，我們談不上毁家紓難，不過，我們須盡我們的力啊！爸爸！你出錢，我出氣力，我將跟這位大哥去，加入義勇軍，殺盡那班蠻不講理的敵人」！</p>
<p>「你的妻子怎樣？」</p>
<p>「管她」！</p>
<p>「那不能」！</p>
<p>「爸爸，你看！隔壁的陳剛，對門的樊品山，他們都加入義勇軍了！他們不是一樣的有妻子嗎？品山的妻子，還跟着丈夫去當救護員呢！」</p>
<p>「我也去！」是瑯的妻的聲音。</p>
<p>「好！同志！」瑯和他的妻子握了一握手。</p>
<p>「我不能，·····我不能阻止你們，因爲我們每人的身體都是國家的啊！去罷！爲我們的國家民族，去奮鬥，掙扎罷！我不會因你們離我而去而悲傷！我現在悲傷的是：我們的國防軍平日坐吃軍餉，外侮來了爲甚麽不抵抗？要你們這班未成年的青年去禦敵！去罷！我預祝你們成功！」</p>
<p>「再會！」三人齊聲說，頭也不回地出門去了。</p>
<p>「砰」的一聲，門又關上了。</p>

<p>編者先生；</p>
<p>貴報一月九日店員通訊欄「如何抗日的研究」，結論是㈠經濟絶交㈡準備武力抵抗㈢增進個人智識。並蒙將愚見「有力者出力，有錢者出錢」的一段採入。</p>
<p>我目下又發生了一個感想；就是要奮起力行。我國人有一種大毛病！只會講，不能行；紙上談兵，非不天花亂墜，但是實際却等於零。從今日起，應當痛改前非；坐而言者，要能起而行才行。</p>
<p>有人也許要問「你自己怎樣呢？豈不也犯了這大毛病嗎？」這個我敢很坦直地答，「否」。我本來想去加入義勇軍的。因爲現在政府没有下令，出兵收復失地，呌我到那裏去投効呢？我有祖母父母。雖則暫時使我不忍抛棄；但是我有兄弟四人，一個人死了，是無所爲的；所以一旦政府决心下令出兵抗日，我就可以不顧一切，加入義勇軍；殺死幾個敵人而死，以了我「爲國捐軀」的志願。即使在我死之前，不幸竟不能殺得到敵人　戰塲上很普通的｜那末爲捍衛國家而死於戰塲，也是求仁得仁，死亦瞑目的。</p>
<p>前天我在報上讀到白崇禧將軍覆王曉籟先生電云，「除報仇雪恥抗日剿共外，决不參加任何内爭」；又白將軍覆廢戰會電云，「一致對外，共挽危亡」。希望全國的軍事官長，大家都有像白將軍般的决心，槍曰口向外，一致抗日，那我就可以得到死所了。</p>
<p>編者先生：請你容許我利用貴報一角貴重的地位，作爲我下這决心的宣誓罷！</p>
<p>應中元</p>
<p>編者按：讀了應君這封充滿愛國情序的信，我們除了欽佩之外，還有何說呢。但是古人說得好，「凡事預則立」。應君旣有這種志願與决心，應當此時有所準備；如加入商團啦。加入保衛團啦。多看關於軍事智識的書籍啦。尤其最好立刻去加入行伍；因爲在戰鬥的時候，經騐的需要，比空洞的學理更迫切。「馬革裹屍」「誓不生還」是一個戰士應有的精神；事實上也須要求戰術的改進，避免無謂的犧牲。「不習而有爲，與夫素習之者，則有間焉」。此言豈欺我哉！</p>

<p>— 杜彥耿</p>
<p>上海扼揚子江的咽喉，乃京滬滬杭甬二鐵道的總匯，又是外洋航輪薈萃之地，交通便利，金融實業文化咸集中於此遂造成我國唯一的大商埠。更因國内政治社會之不安定，内地人民生活危殆，薄有資產以上者都以上海爲安樂窩，紛紛奔集，人口便日漸增多，形式上也就更漸繁榮，且國民政府建都南京以還，京滬路上冠蓋不絶，黨國巨公，或卜居於租界，或酬酢於洋塲，因此上海除了在經濟上處於重要的地位外，在政治上也含有相當的意義。上海的旺盛，確是可憑我們的直覺所承認了。</p>
<p>但是，上海的旺盛，與我們的國事却成爲反比例，什麽原因？祗要觀察已往的事實便可明白，例如每次内地發生一回人禍或天災，上海的人口率即跟着增多一次，上海的表面也就更形旺盛一層。那末，上海的這樣旺盛，不就是内地的凋敝麽？所以我說：上海的旺盛，與國事成了反比例。上海的畸形發展，旣是内地的騷亂所促成，頭腦簡單之流，見了上海表面的旺盛而沾沾自喜者，不啻昩於局勢的聾瞽罷了。其實逍遙於上海，簡直是釜底游魚，若不急自反省，難免有同歸於盡之虞。寫到這裏，不禁不寒而慄了。</p>
<p>負上海建設治安之責的機關有三，一是市政府，一是公共租界工部局，一是法租界工董局。市政府的管轄區域在租界以外的市區範圍，如南市，閘北，江灣，吳淞等；其中比較熱閙者爲南市閘北二區。但閘北精華已盡燬於一二八之役，復興需時。南市人口雖多，但物質的建設，因歷史與經濟之關係，一時尙難猛進：商業則以人民心理與習慣的原因，亦未能與租界並馳。至於市中心區，自一二八戰事以後，市政經費支絀，與一般人心趨向西區的原因，故不能如初期的迅快。</p>
<p>市政府管轄的上海區域，其情狀旣如上述，可知所謂繁榮的上海，乃僅是給外人操縱着的公共租界與法租界而已。所以譽爲紐約第二倫敦第二的上海者，祗是外國人的上海罷了，言之能不慚愧？</p>
<p>然而建設繁榮的上海的財力，却是我們黃膚黑眼的主人翁的膏血。把自己的資財，給外國人拿去建築他們的繁榮上海，可以見得同胞們惰性的一斑。安居在租界之上，恬不知惕，更可見得我們只有依人的奴性，没有獨立與創造的精神。</p>
<p>現在，大家應該可以覺悟了罷？我們須憑自己的精神智財去開闢一個我國自己的商埠，以湔前恥，而挽利權。密邇上海的東方大港，是總理指定的商埠，於地理於人事均較上海爲更優，一俟開闢成功，將來之繁榮，不難駕乎上海之上。不過，我們須得及早努力，免爲外人捷足，因爲他國人士的覬覦此東方唯一優越商港者正大不乏人呢。</p>
<p>有財力，有智力的同胞們速起圖之！并希望政府當局以國家之力量獎掖扶助之，使於最短期間得獲實現！因爲這是有關全國經濟榮衰的重大建設啊。（未完）</p>

<p>— 欣夫</p>
<p>一闰打從「新巴比倵城」Ｎeubabelsberg烏發攝影塲出來的遊客，他這樣對人說：「現在我可知道這地方爲什麽呌「新巴比倫城」了，原來他們工作起來，是說着各地各鄕的語言，好像昔年造巴比倫塔一樣的。」</p>
<p>烏發攝影塲所佔有的面積，超過九十英畝，在那裏，有四十二座大房子：還有許多空地方，建築着很多攝製影片時候用的街道，皇宮，草舍，府邸，牧塲，樹林，水池，橋樑和各種各色的東西，在那些大建築物中，有十四間一層和兩層樓的房子是原料和財產的倉庫，六間發電室，三間藏放拷貝的地窖，還有一大間地窖，是專爲藏放原片的，此外還有兩間極大的辦公房子，工人平均六七百人。</p>
<p>攝影塲裏的電話，一共有三百五十線，統統是用自動機的，再要說到警察規則，當然是很嚴厲而很有秩序的了，禁止吃烟的告白，到處皆是，裏面的救火人員，常駐塲内的，一共是十九名，分作三處駐紮，</p>
<p>有兩座極大和兩座較小的房子，設立着九個收音塲。最雄偉的建築，要算一九二六年名工程師司塔烏拉克造的那座高大房子了，它所佔地面積爲九千方碼，裏面包藏着三個大劇塲，在劇塲的四圍，有五十間的間隔，是拿來給演員做換衣，洗澡和化妝室用的，而導演等的辦事室，也一併包括在内，</p>
<p>另外還有一座攝影塲，是一九二九年建築的，佔地三千八百方碼，裏面有四個收音塲。牆壁和屋頂，都依照音學原理築成，所以毫無雜音侵入，即使大風大雨時的雷聲，也不能侵犯到裏面去，這種建築，確然是値得稱許的，還有關於烏發的其他一切，容俟改日再談罷！</p>

<p>他到了美國，又照樣在好萊塢建築茅屋，地面上的冬天居住樹頂上的夏天居住。這個笑談散播了全美，因爲全美國祇有三十層六十層一百層以至一百五層的高厦，但從來没有復古式的樹頂結屋，所以他們傳爲笑談。</p>

<p>— 華明</p>
<p>晚好萊塢的導演，極注意演員的一舉一動，因爲每個演員，總有一種習慣性的動作，和不自然的表情，往往在無意之中流露出來，導演遇到這種情形，立刻糾正，有時竟當面叱責，决不忽略過去的，</p>
<p>瑙瑪希拉對於這一點，有一片談話，她說：「習慣性的動作，差不多個個人有的，自己並不覺得，别人看着，十分討厭，我最不好的習慣動作，是常常回過頭去，起先我不覺得什麽，並且有人說我這種姿勢非常美，後來一刻不息的旋過頭去，我自己覺得很難看，從此每想把頭旋過去時，立刻自己阻止自己，這個惡習漸漸地改除了，</p>
<p>表情中最難的，要算笑了，瑙瑪在ＴＤivorcee一片中的嗤嗤嘻笑，完全出於自然，毫不勉强，這因爲她用心練習，所以要表演一種表情，可以隨心所欲，　　七重天的導演弗蘭克巴柴ＦrankＢarzage說：「我最注意泰然自若的表情，每有動作勉强的地方，我無不改革，和我表演的幾位都同我一樣見解，所以我導演的片子没有跼促踟蹰的表情的，」</p>
<p>現在把幾個明星習慣性的動作，大略記下：</p>
<p>雷電華新進女星美國嘉寳凱絲玲海朋ＫatharineＨepbura常常縮緊嘴脣，使嘴脣縐凸。</p>
<p>格綸達法雷ＧlendaFarrell歡喜舉起手來，小指放到牙齒上去，在Ｉ　Ａm　aＦugitive一片内一幕中連舉三次。</p>
<p>康斯登裴納脫在每齣劇中，總要舉一次手起來摸摸頭髮，心中好像覺得頭髮不整齊了，一定要摸一摸才覺得入心。</p>
<p>曼麗畢克馥的惡習是常常撅起嘴巴，現在好久不見她撅嘴了，</p>
<p>曼麗特蘭漱在「拯女記」和「愛瑪恨史」二片中的斜視，她在這二片中是應當有這種表情的，但斜視得太多了，不免覺得無味，</p>

<p>愛茵哈定每在開口說話之前，呼吸便促迫了。</p>

<p>「哈囉，哈囉，」愛立克高聲地喊著。「是的，我是愛立克，噲，保羅，巴克萊銀行的借欵！」</p>
<p>那一頭保羅不等他說完，就挿嘴：</p>
<p>「愛立克，記下來，這是萬分要緊的。趕緊想法尋出北海隣近那箇地方是出產最好的Ｐerwinkles的。找到了用氷好，雇一架飛機送到此地。我明天午刻一定要的。什麽？」他顯然的聽見了愛立克要報告許多公事，有些不耐煩了。「你隨便去安排就是了，不要忙，不要愁，我自會設法的。再見吧。」</p>
<p>「不過，保羅！巴克萊！」愛立克的臉都急得青了，但是那面的電話機已經掛上了。他對了四週圍呆若木鷄的許多人說「他把電話掛上了。」</p>

<h3 id="e3">Committee of Nineteen Held Closed-Door Meeting Yesterday <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations' Committee of Nineteen held a closed-door meeting at 4 PM today. During this first meeting, Chairman Hymans only reported to the attending representatives on his discussions with representatives of both parties during the recess. The purpose of these discussions was to seek understanding between both parties, based on the draft resolution passed by the Committee of Nineteen last December. Hymans and League of Nations Secretary-General Drummond are striving to get Japan to accept this draft resolution. To achieve this goal, the Committee of Nineteen intends to replace the committee's explanatory memorandum with a chairman's declaration, because the explanatory memorandum is strongly opposed by the Japanese side. In addition, the draft resolution itself does not mention the recognition or non-recognition of "Manchukuo," it is said. The Japanese delegation has telegraphed this proposed amendment to Tokyo, and the Japanese government will submit it for discussion at tomorrow's cabinet meeting. Therefore, the Japanese government's official response cannot be delivered to Geneva before tomorrow evening, so the Committee of Nineteen will probably not meet until Wednesday. (Havas dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Because the amendment to the resolution has not been communicated to the Chinese delegation, Dr. Yen telegraphed a letter to the Chairman of the Committee, Hymans, stating that the Chinese government attaches great importance to the amendment proposed on December 26 and the draft resolution and explanatory memorandum. Therefore, the Chinese delegation feels it necessary to ask the chairman to pay attention to this matter. Now that the delegation has heard that the original draft on which the Chinese amendment was based has been changed, it is quite worried. The delegation has not received a copy of this revised text. If it is as rumored, this revision is very unfair to one of the parties and will make reconciliation unacceptable to China. Therefore, the delegation requests to be informed of the true content. (Reuters dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Dr. Yen's letter to Hymans is likely to spark an important discussion at this afternoon's meeting of the Committee of Nineteen, as some members of the committee also feel that no one has the authority to change the draft resolution without prior approval. It is reported that the basis of the compromise agreed upon by League of Nations Secretary-General Drummond and League of Nations Deputy Secretary-General Sugimura (pending approval by the Japanese government) is an agreement. If Tokyo approves it, it will be submitted to the committee as a Japanese proposal. The details of this process will be explained at the meeting. (Reuters dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Today, the Chinese representatives visited representatives of various countries throughout the morning to protest against League of Nations Secretary-General Drummond's arbitrary and biased behavior in proposing a new plan to resolve the Sino-Japanese dispute without first consulting China and the Committee of Nineteen. It is now believed that when the Committee of Nineteen meets at 4 PM this afternoon, Drummond will attend to explain the new plan, which is not very different from the old plan drafted by the Committee of Nineteen in its main points. It is also heard that Drummond hopes that his proposed new plan will be accepted by Japan. However, after the Chinese representatives protested separately, it is heard that leaders such as Swedish representative Westman, Czech representative Haetreli, and Irish representative Lester will protest Drummond's actions at the Committee of Nineteen meeting, citing the fact that Chairman Hymans had instructed the Secretary-General to negotiate a solution based on the draft resolution agreed upon by the committee. Chinese representative Yen Hui-ching has sent a letter to Chairman Hymans this morning, formally protesting the failure to send the draft of the resolution revised by Drummond to the Chinese delegation. A spokesperson for the Chinese delegation also declared that the amendments to the draft resolution by the Committee of Nineteen, according to what they have heard, will be regarded as an obviously unfair act to one party, and some of them will be unacceptable to China. According to news from the Chinese delegation, the so-called Drummond plan is actually the wish of the Japanese and is practically drafted by the Japanese. (National News Agency dispatch, 16th)</p>

<p>Small Nations Despise Drummond</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to Japanese sources, the League of Nations Secretariat knows that the compromise plan is a complete surrender to Japan. If Japan is not satisfied and demands further revisions, the Committee of Nineteen will not be able to pass it. Therefore, it can only earnestly persuade Japan to accept it on the one hand, and resort to compulsory mediation under Article 15, Paragraph 4 on the other. It is heard that the plan has been drafted, and the content is very peaceful in order to prevent Japan from withdrawing from the League of Nations. (China United Press dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Committee of Nineteen is scheduled to meet at 4 PM tomorrow. Representatives from various countries have arrived in Geneva one after another. Representatives of the small countries are all shocked when they see Drummond's compromise plan. How can the sacred covenant of the League of Nations be placed under such capitulation to militaristic Japan? The representatives are all indignant at Drummond's biased behavior.

<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs held a ministry meeting today to discuss the content of the instructions. It is heard that it has been decided to demand further amendments. If the League of Nations listens to Japan's demands, the Japanese government will cancel its reservation to invoke Article 15 and accept its resolution. Otherwise, it will order the Japanese delegation led by Matsuoka to temporarily leave Geneva and observe the situation in Paris. However, it will not immediately announce its withdrawal from the League of Nations. The content of the amendments is as follows: (1) The authority of the small committee must be limited, and the committee must not directly resolve the Sino-Japanese dispute. (2) It must be clearly stated that the United States will not be invited to participate in the mediation. (3) Chapter 9 of the Lytton Report must not be used as a principle for mediating the Sino-Japanese dispute, and only the principles proposed in the report can be recognized as helpful in resolving the Sino-Japanese dispute. (4) The above three amendments should be clearly stated in the chairman's declaration, and no room for doubt should be left. The amendment will be approved by the cabinet meeting tomorrow, and then Foreign Minister Uchida will ask the Emperor for approval, and it will be telegraphed to Japanese representative Matsuoka in Geneva tomorrow night.

<h3 id="e6">Explanatory Memorandum Changed to Declaration <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>Content Circulated by the Japanese Side</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The full text of the chairman's declaration案 telegraphed by the Japanese delegation in Geneva to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at noon yesterday is as follows: (1) The General Assembly, based on the resolution of the Committee of Nineteen on December 9, 1932, will study the report of the Lytton Commission of Inquiry, the written opinions of China and Japan, the opinions and proposals expressed at the General Assembly, and the resolution of the Council on February 19, 1932, and entrust it to draft a definition of the resolution of the dispute transferred to the General Assembly and submit it to the General Assembly as soon as possible. (2) Regarding the general situation of the Sino-Japanese dispute, the first eight chapters of the Lytton Report have described the facts. (3) However, at present, it is not the time for the Committee of Nineteen to submit its opinions on the facts of the dispute in this case to the General Assembly, because the obligation of the General Assembly, which is entrusted with the problem according to Article 15, Paragraph 3 of the Covenant, is first to reconcile. (4) Therefore, when continuing to work according to Article 15, Paragraph 3 of the Covenant, the General Assembly must take an extremely cautious attitude, in other words, only to the extent written in the resolution proposed by the Committee of Nineteen to the General Assembly today. (5) According to the resolution of March 11, 1932, the task of the Committee of Nineteen is to prepare for the resolution of the dispute with the consent of the parties to the dispute. (6) In order to deal with the actual situation of the dispute in this case, the Committee of Nineteen will set up a small committee with limited members from its members to help the two parties fundamentally resolve the case. In order to participate in this undertaking, the small committee may propose to invite representatives of other League of Nations or non-League of Nations countries. (7) The small committee has the power to take all necessary measures to carry out its tasks, and may listen to the opinions of experts or have experts participate in its affairs. (8) The members of the small committee, regarding the legal issues of the dispute in this case, will be based on the resolution of March 11, 1932, and regarding the factual issues, will be based on the findings described in the first eight chapters of the investigation report, but the written opinions of the parties to the dispute must be considered, and regarding the method of resolving the dispute, such as each principle in Chapter 9 of the report as stated in paragraph 4. (9) The report of the Committee of Nineteen is submitted to the General Assembly, and the General Assembly adopts measures that it deems appropriate to resolve the dispute in this case. However, the Committee of Nineteen highly expects that the measures taken by the League of Nations will not violate the Covenant of the League of Nations, the Kellogg-Briand Pact, the Nine-Power Treaty, the resolution of March 11 of last year, and the principles contained in the draft resolution of this case, in order to resolve the dispute in this case.

<p>London Newspapers Filled with Pro-Japanese Arguments</p>
<p>(London) This morning, the Daily Mail severely criticized those who act emotionally and demand that the League of Nations take strict steps to stop Japan. It said that in this matter, if one harbors prejudice and intimidates friendly countries, there is no greater mistake. The European countries have no deep relationship with the management of Manchuria, while Japan's security is tied to it. The League of Nations' responsibility is to remind the Chinese to know that the first necessity of maintaining peace in the Far East is to create an administration that can guarantee order and fulfill the obligations of a civilized country. The newspaper mentioned the letter signed by the Archbishop of York and others published in the newspaper on January 13, saying that Britain has no dispute with Japan and will never act as an enemy to its old friend because of the words of the noisy peace faction. The Daily Express said that Britain would be crazy if it interfered. Britons must guard against those who act emotionally and try to exert their peaceful ideas at the cost of involving Britain in foreign struggles that have nothing to do with it. (Reuters dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>(London) Today, the Daily Telegraph commented on this afternoon's meeting of the Committee of Nineteen, saying that none of the major European powers intend to restrain Japan in order to return Manchuria to China. Although the United States strongly opposes it, it also does not want to join the League of Nations or independently punish Japan. This situation is well known throughout the world and is also well known to Japan. We hope that the proposal of League of Nations Secretary-General Drummond to transfer the entire case to the Committee of Seven for handling will be approved in Geneva. Although a few small countries may object, the decision on this serious event related to peace in the Far East should be made by those who bear the responsibility. (Reuters dispatch, 16th)</p>

<p>The Manchester Guardian Speaks for the Government</p>
<p>(London) The Manchester Guardian criticized the Manchurian situation today, saying that the indefinite delay of reconciliation at a time when Japan's atrocities against unfortunate China continue is tantamount to announcing the failure of the League of Nations. If it is said that the League of Nations has not yet reached the point where it must accept the Lytton Report regardless of the consequences and advocate its implementation, then it is beyond our understanding. Either Japan retreats, or the League of Nations retreats. One of the two is inevitable. Since September 1931, the British government has always adopted a vacillating policy, only playing into Japan's hands. What is the reason for this move by the British government? Does it incur China's hatred, or does it act in isolation from the United States, and is it beneficial? (Reuters dispatch, 16th)</p>

<p>All Members Sworn Into Office Simultaneously</p>
<p>——A Discussion Meeting is Scheduled for Today——</p>
<p>(Nanjing) President of the Legislative Yuan Sun Ke and all members of the Third Legislative Committee were sworn into office at the National Government at 10:30 on the morning of the 16th. Yu Youren represented the Central Government as the overseer, and Chairman Lin presented the seal and gave a speech. In addition to the swearing-in personnel, those who participated in the ceremony included Chairman Lin, Yu Youren, Ye Chucang, Qin Zhen, Chu Minyi, Shi Ying, Zhu Jiahua, Zeng Zhongming, Tang Shengzhi, Zhang Qun, and other members of the Central Committee, as well as heads of various ministries and commissions, and civil and military officials of the National Government, more than 500 people. Ding Chao Wu, Pan Yunchao, Wang Qi, Chen Zhaoying, Liang Hancao, and other 69 members of the Legislative Committee were present. The ceremony was conducted in accordance with etiquette. Yu Youren, representing the Central Government, delivered a speech, followed by a speech by Chairman Lin, who earnestly explained and instructed on the importance of the work of the Legislative Yuan, its past achievements, and future hopes, and expressed his deep expectations for drafting a draft constitution based on the resolutions of the Third Plenary Session in order to end political tutelage and implement constitutional government as scheduled. Finally, Sun Ke replied, expressing his respect and acceptance of the speeches of the Central Government representative and Chairman Lin, and said that the Legislative Yuan had already established a good foundation under the leadership of the previous Presidents Hu and Shao and should continue this tradition to establish the rule of law for the country, draft a draft constitution, and complete important codes, which are the current urgent tasks of the Legislative Yuan. Colleagues inside and outside the Yuan should strive to complete the above responsibilities, he said. After the ceremony, Sun and all members of the Legislative Committee returned to the Yuan to hold a Memorial Week. Sun reported that he had little experience in legislation, so he did not dare to accept the appointment when he was elected by the Central Government last year. Now the national crisis is becoming more and more serious, and the whole country must be united in spirit, so he resolutely took office at the Third Plenary Session. The work on the legislative side is extensive, such as the organizational law of the National Political Council and the draft constitution, which are arduous tasks. He hoped that colleagues would work together and strive together. The Yuan also scheduled a discussion meeting on the 17th to discuss the affairs of the Yuan and draw lots for seats. (16th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) A certain official of the Judicial Department said that the establishment of the Administrative Court is to hear lawsuits against administrative organs. The former Beijing government established the Pingzheng Yuan, but it had few achievements. The Organic Law of the Judicial Yuan promulgated in the winter of the 17th year of the Republic established an Administrative Court under the Judicial Yuan. The Organic Law of the Administrative Court passed by the Legislative Yuan in the winter of last year is already well-established and can easily be realized in a short period of time. The Administrative Court will adopt a five-person system and will establish three tribunals, each with one president and four judges. The responsibilities are very important. It is currently being prepared, and the specific methods and location of the Yuan will be decided after President Ju returns to the capital. (16th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>

After investigating the truth, they will give appropriate assistance. However, in the past ten days, more than 10,000 letters have been received, most of which are outside the scope, because it has been rumored that it is an unlimited charitable undertaking, so all labor classes, women, children, monks, and nuns have sent letters. The agency posted a notice again on the 16th to stop receiving letters, with the words that they are ashamed of their weakness and that it is difficult to open the door to charity. Although this is an interesting anecdote in the wind and snow, it is enough to show the universality of the unemployment problem in all circles in Hankou. (16th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>

<h3 id="e41">A Second Piece of Loyal Advice to the British Government Yuan <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>It is remembered that Sir Simon, a Briton, delivered a speech about the Sino-Japanese problem a month ago. Our public opinion considered it to have the suspicion of shielding Japan, and gave loyal advice. Subsequently, the British authorities stated that Britain faithfully supports the charter of the Association and will never violate its long-standing fair attitude. Our Chinese people deeply felt that the British authorities could accept good words and believed that they would not deceive our Chinese people. Now, at the moment when the Japanese are wantonly violent in Yuyu and Rehe, and when the committee of nineteen nations is specially meeting, the so-called Drummond new draft has suddenly been put forward by the five-nation sub-committee meeting. This new draft is a revision of the draft formed by the previous special meeting of the nineteen nations, secretly understood by Drummond, the secretary-general of the League of Nations, and the Japanese representative. It has not included the non-recognition of the Manchurian puppet organization, nor has it clearly invited Russia and the United States to participate. These two points were obtained by our foreign representatives who were fighting hard for them at the special meeting of nineteen nations. Our Chinese people still suspected that the draft of the special meeting was too weak, but did not expect that the new draft of Drummond today would specialize in complying with the Japanese. The meaning of the Chinese side was wiped out in one stroke. As Reuters said, it obviously did not take into account the slightest interest of China. The Central News Agency's Geneva telegram further explained that Britain among the major powers, in particular, was trying to amend the original draft to show its concessions to make Japan happy to accept. From this observation, we cannot but doubt the pro-Japanese nature of British foreign policy.</p>
<p>There is one more thing that can be used to prove the foregoing statement. The London Times, which has been said to be sufficient to represent the attitude of the British Foreign Office, published an editorial on the 13th, saying, "There is no doubt that the Japanese aim is to take Rehe. What the powers are most concerned about is that the war should not spread to the Chinese mainland." It also said that "the Japanese military's proposal to establish a neutral zone is very acceptable. The law of the neutral zone can be promoted to other parts of the world. The Japanese plan can be regarded as a manifestation of the spirit of compromise." The statement that it only asks about the internal affairs of China, not the external affairs, has obviously fully revealed. In other words, it means that the powers may not interfere in the Japanese invasion of Manchuria, and even if they go on to annex Rehe, they can also ignore it, but they do not want to invade the Chinese mainland, which would hinder the interests of the powers in China. This is the same as the recent claim of the Japanese military authorities that "responsible leaders know that the danger of the war extending to the Chinese mainland will cause international disputes and should be avoided as much as possible," and Prime Minister Saito's statement that "Japan must make efforts to solve the Rehe problem without expanding the situation outside the territory of Manchuria," etc., tacitly seem to fit perfectly. The Japanese's mad words that the situation will not be expanded are certainly unbelievable, but from this, it can be inferred the origin of today's Drummond new draft and the origin of the saying that the Anglo-Japanese compromise has succeeded. But have the powerful countries of the League of Nations also thought about what the heaven-appointed responsibility of the League of Nations is? The repeated appeals of our country's representatives, the months of running around by the Lytton Investigation Team, and the discussions and resolutions of the previous sessions of the General Assembly were not for solving the Manchurian problem? But today, it suddenly wants to ignore the problem of recognizing the Manchurian puppet state, then the League of Nations' acceptance of this case before was meddling, and the work of gathering and researching in Geneva for the past year was also in vain. May I ask if the League of Nations can still call for public reason and justice in the future? The Miller Review reported yesterday that Britain and France had compromised with Japan, saying that when the Japanese army withdrew from Shanghai, Britain and France secretly allowed Japan not to interfere in the Manchurian problem. We certainly dare not assert as resolutely as the Miller Report that it is quite credible, but in light of the facts, we also dare not assert that it is not credible.</p>
<p>The relationship between China and Britain has always been considered friendly. The reason why there is this move to amend the original plan now, we can forgive that it is not really evil to China, but it is just to protect its market power in China and is eager to bring China and Japan closer. Since Japan is strong and not easy to comply, then the only way is to force the weak and incompetent China to accommodate Japan. However, I do not know that this kind of ideal is bound to be contrary to the facts in the end. As far as the League of Nations itself is concerned, supporting the strong and suppressing the weak violates the original intention of the League of Nations to advocate public reason and justice. The more the weak and small are oppressed, the more the spirit of discontent will accumulate in the middle, and the reaction in the future will inevitably be more forceful. Today, the military power of the capitalist powers can still use its prestige to maintain itself for a time. The representatives of the weak and small countries who advocate justice can be replaced and made not to attend, but once the situation is seen to be in decline, it will inevitably break out and become uncontrollable. There has been this brewing movement for several years, and it will become faster and faster in the future. Even if we take our country as an example, how can we be oppressed for a long time and not move until we die? The powers should have realized this long ago. As far as the relationship between China and Japan is concerned, the violent and unreasonable invasion by the Japanese. Our country is no match for them in terms of military power, and endures and accepts it. However, the hatred of a hundred years becomes deeper and deeper. Once the pain of being slaughtered can no longer be endured, we will inevitably rise up and fight them to the death. At this time, it is difficult to guarantee that it will not happen by 横决, and everything will be sacrificed without hesitation, and everything will be cared for without order. Even if the powers maintain themselves well, I am afraid they will not be able to avoid being implicated. This is also something that the powers should have considered long ago.</p>
<p>Even in the eyes of the powers, thinking that shielding Japan and suppressing China is enough to make them feel safe for a while is the biggest mistake. We humbly hope that the British authorities will change their minds and not be threatened by the strong force of Japan and deceived by sweet words. This is what our Chinese people dare to sincerely advise.</p>

<p>The Tokyo Hochi Shimbun reports that since the Hearst newspaper chain in the United States promoted a boycott of Japanese goods, it has gradually spread to American industrialists, bankers, and labor groups. The momentum is particularly strong on the West Coast. All Hearst newspapers are unanimously boycotting Japanese goods. Inexpensive items such as Japanese-made light bulbs, rubber shoes, ceramics, and matches are all within the scope of the boycott. Many members of both houses of Congress are in favor of this proposal.</p>

<p>Parliament Opposes Salary Cuts and Tax Hikes</p>
<p>Pangou Government Faces Potential Collapse</p>
<p>Reuters, Paris, 15th - France is currently facing serious political turmoil triggered by the Finance Minister's proposed budget. The Finance Minister advocates cutting the salaries of cabinet members and officials, reducing government spending in various administrative departments, and increasing taxes. It is widely expected that this proposal will be strongly opposed by Parliament, and the Pangou government is facing the possibility of failure. Today, there are also rumors that a general strike of officials at all levels will occur to protest the salary cuts. The government held talks with representatives of officials at all levels today regarding the salary cuts, but the negotiations broke down, and the rumors intensified. The situation is indeed serious. However, calm observers believe that while the government may fail, a general strike is unlikely to materialize. Judging from the current situation, officials generally seem to want to resist the salary cuts in some way, but the method remains to be determined. There are three options currently available to civil servants: ㈠ A strike lasting several hours to show protest; ㈡ Adopting a policy of deliberate slowdown to backlog various official duties; ㈢ A general strike. Currently, the third option has not gained strong support, but no action is likely to be taken before Parliament votes on the supplementary budget.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Paris, 15th - Finance Minister Cheron's budget balancing plan, after being discussed by the cabinet all day, has been substantially passed today with slight revisions to the original plan. Regarding the reduction of official salaries and pensions, it has now been changed so that salaries below 12,000 francs will not be reduced, while those above this amount will be reduced in tiers, with larger salaries being reduced more. Furthermore, in order to please the Socialist Party, military spending has been reduced by 700 million francs. However, it remains unclear whether the crucial Socialist Party will be satisfied with this. Approximately after the government submits the temporary budget for February to Parliament on Tuesday, the party's attitude will become clear.</p>
<h3 id="e60">Philippine Independence Question <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>Stimson Writes Letter to Congress Explaining</p>
<p>House Still Maintains Original Plan After Deliberation</p>
<p>Philippine Assembly Rejects American Proposal</p>
<p>National News Agency, Washington, 15th - U.S. Secretary of State Stimson wrote a letter to Congress regarding the Philippine independence case, stating that U.S. possession of the Philippines creates a balance of power in the Far East. If abandoned immediately, it will lead to a chaotic trend in Far Eastern issues. This letter from Stimson was issued in support of President Hoover's position. At the time, Secretary of War Hurley, Secretary of Agriculture Hyde, and Secretary of Commerce Chaplin also sent letters to Congress, elaborating on the shortcomings of the Philippine independence letter. These letters were all published today. Stimson also stated in his letter that if the United States withdraws troops from the Philippines, it will have an unsettling effect on the political thought of various countries and Far Eastern nations and will affect the relationship between Far Eastern national political thought and the political thought of the rest of the world. Stimson also said that this case, on the one hand, disregards the distinction between individual freedom and self-governance for Filipinos, and on the other hand, ignores the difference between complete economic separation and political separation. Anyone who lives with Filipinos cannot help but be sure of their so-called desire for independence. The fundamental desire of the Filipinos is for a government with complete internal autonomy, and they still do not want to abandon U.S. protection and the benefits of the U.S.-Philippine union. Furthermore, this case is prone to misunderstanding and violates the plans of the founders of U.S.-Philippine policy. In short, the Philippine independence issue can only be resolved with fairness and impartiality, without any prejudice. The Filipinos' desire for self-governance should be fulfilled, but their interests should also be protected. Secretary of Agriculture Hyde said that American farmers have been deceived, and Secretary of Commerce Chaplin detailed the advantages and disadvantages of an independent Philippine government in terms of commercial relations. Secretary of War Hurley said that this case fails to protect the Philippines economically. Just considering sugar production, the Philippines will lose hundreds of millions of dollars annually after independence. Lin Bai Ke, advisor to the Chinese government, also said that he agrees with the U.S. President's veto of this case because it does not adequately protect the legal business operations of overseas Chinese in the Philippines. If this case is established, it is feared that the Filipinos will try to force overseas Chinese to become citizens, but he does not agree with the President's view that the Chinese people will constantly migrate to the Philippines, claiming that the Chinese people are interested in the Philippines for business, not agriculture, so only those engaged in business will want to go.</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 15th - Secretary of State Stimson and Secretary of War Hurley, on behalf of President Hoover, delivered a radio broadcast today regarding the Philippine independence issue. The Secretary of War stated that this case is economically unsound and could lead to war. The freedom granted by this case will ultimately have disastrous consequences. At a time when the stabilizing elements in the Far East are all being jeopardized, attention must be paid to the impact of this case on the Far East and the United States, and on moral dignity. The Philippine independence case was vetoed by Hoover on Friday, but the House of Representatives still maintained the original plan after deliberation that day.</p>
<p>Reuters, Manila, 16th - The Philippine House of Representatives held an informal meeting today and voted to decide on the Philippine independence proposal, even if the U.S. Senate overrides President Hoover's veto and passes it, it will not be accepted. It is expected that the Philippine Senate will also make the same decision. According to the proposal, the Philippines would enjoy freedom after ten years.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Manila, 16th - The Philippine independence case passed by the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives and vetoed by the President will be rejected by the Philippine Legislative Assembly. Today, a meeting of key members of the Philippine House of Representatives has decided to oppose the case. Senate President Quezon and other leaders of the independence movement attended the meeting to inquire about the attitude of the House of Representatives, saying that they will personally go to the United States, so they want to know the views of the Legislative Assembly on the case first. Therefore, the key members voted, and all but two advocated that if the case is sent to the Legislative Assembly, it will be rejected. The actions of the Philippine legislators are not unexpected. Quezon initially requested that if full independence is not granted immediately, then please U.S. Congress not to pass any proposals and telegraphed the United States, but the U.S. Congress did not pay attention and passed today's independence bill. The legislators in the United States firmly believed that this case would be accepted by the Filipinos, and the Filipinos initially seemed to express approval upon hearing the news of its passage, but after political leaders explained the various provisions within it, the number of opponents has been increasing daily. What the Filipinos oppose the most is the imposition of tariffs on Philippine goods before granting full independence and the implementation of immigration laws after independence. Some Filipinos who currently oppose independence say that the leaders of the independence movement, seeing the opposition, should take the opportunity to withdraw, and the enthusiasm for independence among the people has now slightly decreased.</p>

<h3 id="e61">National Socialists Win Big in Lippe State Assembly Re-election <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, 16th - The Lippe state assembly elections were held today, and the National Socialist Party won a major victory. The National Socialist Party occupies nine seats and the Socialist Party occupies seven seats. It is expected that the results will strengthen the National Socialist Party's support for a parliamentary session to be extended to March.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 16th - The National Socialist Party's victory in the Lippe state assembly elections has enabled it to increase its electorate from 5,500 to 38,800. It is expected that this will strengthen the party's opposition to the government. Chancellor Schleicher may dissolve parliament as a result of these elections. A notable point in the Lippe state elections is the substantial increase in votes for the Social Democratic Party, while the Communist Party and the German National People's Party lost a significant amount. The loss of the German National People's Party is particularly noteworthy, as it was rumored that Hugenberg had reached an agreement with Hitler to cooperate in Lippe to resist the Social Democratic Party.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Detmold, 15th - The Lippe state assembly elections are being held today. Although the state is only a small entity within the German Federation, the elections are being closely watched by the German people to gauge the rise and fall of the National Socialist Party's influence. Party leaders from Hitler downwards personally went to give speeches, reaching even remote villages. The intensity of the election campaign was rare. Therefore, the party has achieved its wishes in today's voting results, obtaining 38,000 votes, an increase of 5,500 votes compared to the Lippe state assembly elections in January 1929, and an increase compared to the total votes in the general election last November, but still a difference of 3,500 compared to the total votes of the party's heyday on July 30 last year. Although the National Socialist Party is the strongest party, it still cannot occupy a majority in the parliament and must unite with the German National People's Party and the German People's Party to form a government. Several conflicts occurred during today's election. In the small town of Brake, members of the Socialist Party and the National Socialist Party exchanged gunfire, injuring three of the former.</p>

<p>Schleicher Emphasizes Conscription</p>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, 15th - German Chancellor Schleicher made astonishing remarks at a celebration of the 62nd anniversary of the founding of the German Empire held by the people of Berlin today, stating that the conscription system is the most important goal that Germany wants to achieve. The existence of Germany is due to the honorable achievements of the army. The symbol of German free men is the right to bear arms. Germany's enemies know that disarmament is enough to inflict a fatal blow on Germany. The German Chancellor also explicitly stated that Germany will not agree to any disarmament conference that disregards the principle of German sovereignty.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 15th - The Joint Association of German WWI Veterans held its annual meeting here today, attended by German President Hindenburg, former German Crown Prince Wilhelm, General Mackensen, many cabinet members, and many former chiefs of staff of the German Imperial Army. Chancellor Schleicher, in his capacity as Minister of Defense, delivered a speech praising the honor of the former Imperial Army and the importance of national security. Schleicher's speech emphasized that after years of hard work, Germany has achieved equal status in the international community. Therefore, Germany will never sign any disarmament treaty that is not based on this principle of equality. Schleicher also repeatedly stated that Germany's sole aim and intention is to obtain the same guarantees as other countries. Schleicher concluded by saying that he has always supported the idea that citizens should have compulsory military education. This is not intended to expand the army, but to ensure that the people have the determination and preparation to defend the country in times of crisis.</p>

<p>Government Announces Peace in All Regions</p>
<p>Newspapers Record Frequent Disturbances</p>
<p>National, Madrid, 16th - Government authorities issued a semi-official announcement today stating that although there are still extremely tense reports in various places, they have gradually returned to peace and normalcy has been restored. The announcement also stated that the revolutionary upheaval in Barcelona was quelled within two hours, and business has returned to normal. The stock exchanges in Madrid and Barcelona have been active, and the prices of national securities and industrial stocks are showing a thriving trend. The value of Spanish currency abroad has been able to maintain its original price. All of this is sufficient to prove the increasing consolidation of Spanish internal affairs, and even if there are changes, there is no need to worry too much. The above is the government's point of view, but newspapers continue to publish facts of frequent disturbances in various places.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Lisbon, 16th - Twenty-nine Spanish restorationists escaped from the Villa Guedes prison and arrived in Portugal last week, where they were taken in by the Portuguese government. The Spanish government is preparing to protest because the restorationist conspirators lurking near the border will endanger national security. Allowing them to reside in Portugal is an unfriendly act. It is expected that this matter will cause a major diplomatic dispute.</p>

<p>The Whole Story of the Oomori Incident</p>
<p>Changli Correspondence, The reporter took the Beiping-Ning train from Changli to Qinhuangdao at 9:30 AM on the 11th for inspection. Along the way, stations such as Zhangjiazhuang, Liushouying, Beidaihe, and Nandaisi did not have a single passenger boarding. The area east of Changli to Qinhuangdao has become a war-torn zone, so there are only passengers fleeing west from Qinhuangdao, and very few passengers coming east from Changli. When the train arrived at Nandaisi station, sixteen li west of Qinhuangdao, one Japanese cruiser flagship, two destroyers, and two torpedo boats were seen moored on the sea. Black smoke swirled from the chimneys, and the gun covers had been removed, as if entering a major war. Two British warships were moored under Nanshan in Qinhuangdao, reportedly to protect British nationals and the Kailuan Mining Company, and the wharves. At 11:00 AM, the train arrived in Qinhuangdao. After the reporter got off the train, he visited Liu Zhenying, the battalion commander of the 9th Brigade who has been stationed there for a long time. At that time, Battalion Commander Liu was handling diplomacy, talking on the phone with Mr. Ceylon, the British station manager of the Qinhuangdao section. Later, it was learned that a Japanese military police officer named Oomori often traveled between Qinhuangdao and Shanhaiguan. The local people knew him well. At 1:00 PM on the 10th, Oomori suddenly wore a broken suit, covered with a broken green coat, and hid a pistol in his pocket. He walked from the Kailuan wharf south of the railway to the station, intending to spy on the true strength of our military preparations and to provoke us. When the passengers waiting for the train at the station saw Oomori, they cried out in alarm, saying that Japanese soldier Oomori had come. More and more people gathered around to watch. Seeing this, Oomori took out a pistol from his pocket and opened fire on the crowd, further enraging the crowd. The guards near the platform, fearing trouble, took Oomori back to the company headquarters and reported it to the company battalion commander for disposal. At 2:30 PM, Mr. Ceylon, the British station manager of the Qinhuangdao section of the Beiping-Ning Railway, came to negotiate. Oomori was taken away by Ceylon and returned to Japanese Navy Rear Admiral Tsuda, and the pistol he carried was also returned. Everyone thought that everything was fine, but on the morning of the 11th, Tsuda suddenly sent someone to make unreasonable demands: ㈠ Chinese soldiers at the station must be withdrawn immediately, and the guard rights must be handed over to the Japanese army; ㈡ Punish the perpetrators; ㈢ Compensate for the losses; ㈣ Guarantee that this will not happen again in the future; ㈤ Apologize to the Japanese side. For the sake of compromise, we have agreed to slightly withdraw the Chinese soldiers at the station, but the guard rights cannot be handed over to the Japanese army. The Japanese side is still not satisfied, and negotiations are underway. Currently, the scene in Qinhuangdao is that all large and small shops north of the railway have been closed. Only a few vendors selling fried dough sticks and pancakes walk in the face of the cold wind. South of the railway, because of the British merchants of the Kailuan Mining Wharf, there are also many foreign shops, and the order is still good, but 70-80% of them are also closed. The price of rickshaws is five times higher than usual. Japanese planes come to reconnaissance from time to time. Only the Kailuan Hotel was already full, and other hotels and apartments could not be found throughout Qinhuangdao, as they were all closed. Currently, the front line is still at Shihe, twenty-five li east of Qinhuangdao. According to people coming from near Shihe, the Japanese have not advanced further, only in the West Pass outside Shanhaiguan, three li away from the front line of our army in Shihe, but war is ultimately unavoidable.

<h3 id="e65">Northeastern Problem and the League of Nations (XIV) <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>Debate on the Afternoon of the 24th</p>
<p>(Both sides express their opinions twice) The Chairman said, according to precedent, when the Executive Yuan discusses reports of this nature, representatives from both sides of the dispute are given the opportunity to express their opinions twice. Therefore, aside from a very brief statement, this is the last opportunity for the Japanese representative to give a longer speech.</p>
<p>(Yosuke Matsuoka Sophisticates Again) Japanese Representative Yosuke Matsuoka said, "I am not very familiar with this practice. However, I am very grateful to the Chairman for giving me the opportunity to express some further opinions. Yesterday, I suggested that since the Chinese representative had made a serious accusation against a Japanese politician, he should provide evidence to substantiate his claim. This is my view. However, the Chinese representative not only did not provide evidence, not only did not admit that he had evidence, but instead presented a book written by me. The book is in Japanese, and the Chinese representative's citation seems to be accurate. This shows that the Chinese representative has agreed with my statement in the book that the Tanaka Memorial is a forgery. However, although I believe the Tanaka Memorial is a forgery, I have never designated anyone as the forger, nor have I said that the forger was a Chinese person. I only said that I had a report that the memorial was forged. I also did not specify a place name in the book. I remember when drafting it, I received reliable information that the memorial was forged jointly by a military attache of a certain country in Beiping and several Chinese people. After receiving this information, I did not believe it, because accepting such information should be done with extreme caution. Another piece of information said that the document was forged by a small number of irresponsible Japanese people. People who sell such forged documents exist in all countries of the world, not only in Japan. For the sake of clarity, please allow me to recount a small anecdote. Several years ago, we gathered in Tokyo to discuss proposals to be submitted to the Pacific Relations Conference. At that time, after the meeting, there were no results, and no plans were drawn up. Later, I learned from the most reliable source that a certain Japanese person had drafted a report, which contained a plan for the speeches that the Japanese representatives should make at the Tokyo conference. This report was purchased by the Chinese side for a huge sum of 50,000 yuan. This is a fact. I believe it to be true. Such behavior is done by lowly people in all countries, so there is nothing to be surprised about. However, the Chinese representative, in his responsible position, made an unsubstantiated accusation at the Executive Yuan, which is what I find most perplexing. My notes and speeches are all proven by facts. Regarding the Chinese representative's claim that the Chinese National Government did not fully guide the anti-Japanese economic boycott, I have already provided factual evidence to the contrary. At the same time, the Chinese representative also admitted that the Chinese government did participate in and encourage this movement to some extent. Now, I will present some more evidence as follows: First, the order of the Executive Yuan of the Nanjing National Government. The original text is in Chinese, and the translation can be found in Annex 230 of the investigation team's report, which contains instructions on methods to boycott Japanese residents and goods in China. Second, Instruction No. 9 of the Navigation Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Communications, addressed to the Tianjin Tokai Steamship Company. This company usually uses Chinese names, so the Chinese government mistakenly thought it was a Chinese enterprise and accidentally sent the secret order to a Japanese company. This is how we obtained this secret order. The content of the secret order can be found in Annex 232 of the investigation team's report. Third, the instructions of the Beiping Kuomintang Department regarding the economic boycott. The translation was sent by the Japanese representative to the investigation team for reference. All of the above can undoubtedly refute the Chinese representative's words. I urge the members of the Executive Yuan to examine it carefully. Also, regarding what the Chinese representative said this afternoon, I only need to point out one thing, that is, although the Chinese representative claimed that my speech avoided the main issues and focused on trivial issues, in fact, his speech was a self-portrait. If I turn to the right, the Chinese representative turns to my left. If I turn to the left, the Chinese representative turns to my right. This shows that the Chinese representative never dares to face me head-on. Regarding the Tanaka Memorial issue, I will not repeat it. Regarding the Sino-Russian Secret Treaty, the Chinese representative said that its purpose was to prevent Japanese aggression against Chinese territory. In fact, the members of the Executive Yuan only need to check the historical facts to understand who is right and who is wrong, and there is no need for me to repeat it. As for the telegram regarding the Northeastern Incident obtained by the Chinese representative, I really know nothing about it. I do not like to talk about what I do not know. Therefore, when necessary, I will pursue the facts of the incident, and perhaps I can present a visual account to you. The Chinese representative said that the main points of the Sino-Japanese dispute are: 1. Japanese military actions in Manchuria. Japan has already acquired Manchuria. Can this be called a self-defense action? 2. The "Manchukuo" independence movement. Is this movement truly based on the free will of the local people, as Japan claims? 3. The withdrawal of troops. Japan has not yet fulfilled this promise. 4. Japan promised not to aggravate the situation. Has Japan kept its promise? 5. Is there a peaceful solution to this problem? Regarding the above questions, the Japanese government's answer to the first and second questions is "yes," but the Chinese representative's answer is "no." Regarding the third and fourth questions, the Chinese representative's answer is also "no." Regarding the fifth point, I do not quite understand what the Chinese representative is saying, but I guess it roughly means that there are plenty of peaceful methods, which should be adopted by the League of Nations. Regarding all these points, we have clearly expressed Japan's views and position. Now, there is no need to say more, but if necessary, I will explain it to you in more detail next time. Finally, I dare to say that Japan has always been one of the most loyal member states of the League of Nations. This can be proven by facts and the actions of the Japanese government. However, China has never done anything until it has a complaint against Japan or another country, and then it uses this international peace organization to express its grievances. However, if future developments are absolutely incompatible with Japan's survival or Japan's policy of maintaining peace and order in East Asia, then the Japanese government still hopes to continue to be a loyal servant of the League of Nations."</p>
<p>(Chinese Representative's Written Response) The Chinese representative said that the Chinese side will answer the several points raised by the Japanese representative at the next meeting or in writing.</p>
<p>(Chairman and Matsuoka Debate on the Existence of the Investigation Team) "Chairman" I think there is no need to proceed with the discussion this afternoon. We will study the report tomorrow. Since the case we are discussing is so important, we should give the representatives of both China and Japan the opportunity to express their opinions within a reasonable scope. At the same time, we have already had a lot of success, so I hope that we can discuss the report again tomorrow afternoon.</p>
<p>"Matsuoka" I don't know what the Chairman's position is regarding the reservations I raised yesterday.</p>
<p>"Chairman" What the Japanese representative is referring to is the Executive Yuan's proposal to ask the investigation team to express whether they have changed their opinions. My observation on this matter is that, as a rule, before such an investigation team is dissolved, its chairman, representing the entire team, should attend the Executive Yuan meeting to explain the questions about the report to the members of the Executive Yuan. It seems that we should follow the usual practice this time as well.</p>
<p>"Matsuoka" If the questions asked by the Executive Yuan to the investigation team and the answers given by the investigation team are limited to the report itself, that is, the study of local facts, then I may accept this proposal. I deeply hope that the Chairman will give a clear explanation on this point.</p>
<p>"Chairman" My proposal last night was to ask the members of the investigation team to meet and consider whether the team has any intention to change any part of the report after hearing the opinions of the representatives of the two countries. Therefore, the meeting of the team should be based on the report and nothing else.</p>
<p>"Matsuoka" I object to this proposal. I believe that the investigation team no longer exists. If the Executive Yuan has a request, then the members of the investigation team may express their opinions and explain some events in the report and the points obtained by the team members during their local inspections. We can understand this point by examining the scope of the investigation team's duties. However, if the Executive Yuan and the investigation team are allowed to start asking each other questions about the China issue or the Manchuria issue, going beyond the report and the points obtained by the investigation team during their local inspections, and referring to the notes, opinions, statements, speeches, and everything else submitted by China and Japan in recent days, then I am afraid that I will be forced to ask many questions to each member of the investigation team. Once the questioning begins, the Japanese representative will have the right to ask questions about the report of the investigation team and its attachments, and even all the notes, opinions, statements, etc. This may not be completed in a week or a month. Can the members of the Executive Yuan not find it too long? This is why I object to this proposal.</p>
<p>"Chairman" The Japanese representative seems to have misunderstood. The only question that the investigation team should answer is whether they still hold the same opinions in their report after hearing the opinions of the representatives of China and Japan, or whether they intend to add or change some of their opinions. The investigation team must not specifically involve the opinions of the representatives of China and Japan, nor may they answer the objections expressed by both China and Japan.</p>
<p>"Matsuoka" I think I have not misunderstood the Chairman, but the Chairman seems to have misunderstood what I am advocating. Now, let us assume that the Chairman asks a question to the entire investigation team or individual members, and the investigation team or members express their opinions based on what has been discussed in recent days. Now, let us assume that the Japanese government cannot agree with this opinion. Then, we will naturally raise questions, asking the investigation team or individual members the reasons for reaching this opinion. Once the debate begins, it will take a long time. The Executive Yuan will not be able to deny its right to question until the Japanese government is satisfied. Now, let us assume that the entire investigation team or individual members declare to the Executive Yuan that although there have been debates between China and Japan in recent days, the opinions listed in the report of the investigation team have not changed. The Japanese representative will naturally have to ask questions about why this is so. Once the questioning begins, I am afraid that it will not be completed in a month.</p>
<p>"Chairman" I think that after the representative of the investigation team attends the Executive Yuan, the objections expressed by the Japanese representative will inevitably occur. Because the members of the Executive Yuan or the Chairman may ask the Chairman of the investigation team whether they intend to change their opinions. Since the Executive Yuan can ask the Chairman representing the team, it can naturally ask the entire investigation team the same question.</p>
<p>"Matsuoka" I think that regarding matters within the scope of the investigation team's report, such as the study of certain facts, it is okay to ask questions to the members of the investigation team. However, even if the members of the investigation team are invited to attend the Executive Yuan meeting, we do not need to ask them about what has been discussed at the Executive Yuan in recent days. In short, the questions and answers of the investigation team should be completely within the scope of their report. In addition, there is one more point that I would like to emphasize, that is, in the opinion of the Japanese government, the investigation team no longer exists after the report has been submitted. We have said this before. Therefore, the reason why we did not object when the investigation team was invited to attend the Executive Yuan meeting is because we tacitly agreed that the members of the investigation team should not participate in the Executive Yuan's considerations and proceedings. Therefore, we believe that although the Executive Yuan may ask individual members of the investigation team for their opinions, it may not ask the entire investigation team for their opinions, and may ask the team to explain the sections in the report and its attachments.</p>
<p>"Chairman" Regarding the point of whether the investigation team still exists, my opinion was expressed last night, that is, the investigation team still exists until it is formally dissolved by the Executive Yuan.</p>
<p>"Matsuoka" I object to this explanation. However, even if the investigation team still exists, it should not express opinions on the various considerations conducted within the Executive Yuan. In other words, the investigation team should not be regarded as having the right to attend the Executive Yuan to express opinions and judge right and wrong.</p>
<p>"Chairman" However, the Executive Yuan certainly wants to know all the opinions of the investigation team. The report of the investigation team was drafted before the representatives of China and Japan expressed their opinions. Therefore, there may be several points in these opinions that are sufficient to change the views of the investigation team. This is of course what the Executive Yuan is very willing to know. Regarding this point, I would like to ask other members of the Executive Yuan to express their opinions for reference.</p>
<p>(Czech Representative Upholds Justice) Czech Representative Benes said, "I fully agree with the Chairman's opinion on the procedural issue. According to precedent, investigation teams, etc., appointed by the Executive Yuan are invited to attend the Executive Yuan meetings so that the Chairman or members of the Executive Yuan can ask them to explain their opinions or ask them to answer questions about relevant matters. I think this practice is fully in line with the provisions of the League of Nations Charter regarding meeting procedures, and is not contrary to a kind of faithful sentiment towards the two parties in dispute before the Executive Yuan. Such events should be discussed openly. Therefore, in my opinion, the Chairman's proposal is fully in line with the spirit and precedent of the Executive Yuan. As for the question of whether the investigation team continues to exist, I think that what the report calls 'our work has now been completed' really means 'our work in the area has now been completed' and cannot be interpreted as the investigation team does not intend to answer questions before the Executive Yuan. Furthermore, the political plan formulated by the Executive Yuan should of course be formulated by the members of the Executive Yuan themselves. This is a matter of fact, not a matter of form. Because the investigation team of course cannot express political opinions, but the Chairman and members of the Executive Yuan have the right to seek explanations for the sections in the report at any time. Therefore, in my personal opinion, although there is currently no need for the investigation team to explain, I would very much like to have the opportunity to ask questions.</p>
<p>"Chairman" Are there any other members of the Executive Yuan who wish to express their opinions on this point?</p>
<p>"Matsuoka" Regarding this point, please give a clear and concise statement. The resolution passed by the Executive Yuan on December 10 last year, which appointed this investigation team, stated that "it was decided to appoint an investigation team of five people to go to the area for investigation and report to the Executive Yuan." My opinion is based on this section. Since the case before us is important, the provisions on the duties of the investigation team must be clearly recognized.</p>
<h3 id="e66">Guangdong Government Denies That the Commissioner in Hong Kong Signed Bills of Lading <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>Said to Violate the Regulations for Consular Visa of Foreign Bills of Lading</p>
<p>Guangzhou Communication: Since the Ministry of Finance established a resident visa commissioner in Hong Kong, the Southwest Political Affairs Council believes that this move violates the regulations for consular visa of foreign bills of lading, increases the burden on merchants, and raises prices. It specifically ordered the provincial government that goods using the visa commissioner's signed bills of lading in Hong Kong will not be allowed to be released. If the goods have already paid customs duties according to the usual practice and have not used the aforementioned signed bills of lading, they will be allowed to be released without any obstruction. After receiving the order, the provincial government issued an order to its subordinates yesterday, saying, "Now, we have received Instruction No. 2071 from the Southwest Political Affairs Committee of the National Government, stating that the 49th political affairs meeting of this committee was based on a report from the Chao Hai Customs Superintendent, approving the telegram from Wen Yingxing, the resident visa commissioner in Hong Kong, stating that the visa office was opened on the first of this month, and requesting that goods with the official bills of lading of this office be released, etc. The inspection of consular visa of bills of lading was previously notified by the Ministry of Finance and the Guangdong Provincial Government, and it has been reported to the Customs Service. Please check and issue orders to comply with the previous telegram, etc. This case was previously forwarded by the Executive Yuan to the consulates of the Republic of China abroad to issue regulations for consular visa of bills of lading, and amendments to the articles of the regulations were sent to the meeting, which was followed by the 28th political affairs meeting of this committee. The sections presented by the Chao Hai Customs Superintendent are not in accordance with the original regulations. 1. Article 2 of the regulations states that the consular visa of bills of lading referred to in the previous article can be obtained from the nearest consulate of the Republic of China. The goods must be clearly stated item by item, and signed by the person in charge, and sent to the Chinese consulate in the export location or a nearby export location for visa, etc. There is no provision for setting up a visa commissioner. 2. Article 1 of the regulations states that from the date of implementation of these regulations, all goods transported from overseas to China must be issued a bill of lading by the Chinese consulate. Goods transported from the interior of China through Hong Kong are not transported from overseas, and therefore do not need to be visa. 3. If the goods transported from overseas to China have already been visa by the Chinese consulate in the place, there is no need to visa again when passing through Hong Kong. 4. Although Article 5 of the regulations only stipulates that a handling fee of five customs gold units will be charged for each consular visa of bills of lading, since the regulations do not provide for the establishment of a commissioner, setting up a commissioner to charge fees outside the regulations will increase the burden on merchants. Based on the above reasons, it was decided to order the provincial government and the customs superintendents to continue to handle matters in accordance with the old regulations, without paying fees for signing, so as to facilitate merchants, and to order the customs superintendents not to release those signed by the commissioner. In addition to the separate orders, the provincial government shall immediately follow the instructions and implement them. Instruct囗囗to select capable personnel and jointly with 囗囗to send personnel to supervise the local military and police strictly. Goods that violate the order and use the bills of lading signed by the resident visa commissioner in Hong Kong shall not be released." (January 11)</p>

<p>Divided into Two Types of Plans: Three Years and Five Years</p>
<p>To be Implemented After Review and Resolution</p>
<p>Zhenjiang Communication: The Jiangsu Province land consolidation program originally had a ten-year completion plan. The current concurrent director, Zhao Qilu, intends to shorten the completion year to five years or three years.

Once approved, they will be submitted for resolution and announced for implementation. The original proposed consolidation plan is recorded as follows: "It is found that the land area of each county in Jiangsu Province is more than two to three million mu, with a total of 33 counties. There are 18 counties with more than one million mu, and 10 counties with less than one million mu. The total province is estimated to be more than 150 million mu. It is planned to actively consolidate from this year onwards, with a deadline for completion. The initial plan is for five years. A. Regarding topographic survey: 1. The provincial topographic survey is limited to the end of the 22nd year. The east-west and north-south three trunk lines will be completed uniformly, requiring an estimated expenditure of 160,000 yuan, which will be borne by the province. 2. The county topographic survey of each county will be completed uniformly by the end of the 23rd year, requiring a total expenditure of more than 460,000 yuan, which will be borne by each county. B. Regarding the clear measurement and registration: It is necessary to train personnel in advance. It is planned to hold the first phase in October of this year, graduating in four months, and then start the clear measurement of the 28 counties of the old Ning Zhen Chang Tong Su Song Tai. It will be completed by the end of the 24th year, requiring an estimated clear measurement fee of more than 8.6 million yuan and a registration fee of more than 560,000 yuan (registration will be handled immediately after the clear measurement of a city or township is completed). The second phase will continue in February of the 22nd year, graduating in four months, and then start the 20 counties of Huaiyang, completing by the 25th year, requiring an estimated clear measurement fee of more than 7.8 million.</p>

D. Regarding surveying instruments: In order to complete the provincial topographic survey and the application of trained personnel, the province still needs to purchase an additional 40,000 yuan. As for the instruments used by each county, an average of 12,000 yuan will be purchased per county, and the remaining more than 730,000 yuan will be borne by the county. E. Regarding administrative expenses: The Provincial Land Bureau needs 80,000 yuan per year (during the consolidation period). Each county bureau needs an average of 8,000 yuan per year, totaling more than 2.84 million yuan in five years. In summary, the above will require a total of approximately 30 million yuan to be completed in five years.

It was approved by the Ministry of Finance and forwarded to the Executive Yuan for approval to continue the extension for one year. As for the province's grain, it has now been allowed to be exported and circulated, and the value can be gradually increased. Please inform accordingly."

<p>Shanghai Citizens Deeply Affected by the January 28th Incident</p>
<p>Actively Engaging in Aviation Power and Air Equipment</p>
<p>Mayor Wu Tiecheng of this city delivered a speech at the city government's memorial week yesterday morning, saying, "Premier Sun Yat-sen's legacy of saving the nation through aviation should be most deeply recognized by the people today. The power and greatness of aviation has been very clearly and obviously revealed to us since the outbreak of the European War in 1914 up to the present day. Since the January 28th Incident last year, every citizen of Shanghai has personally experienced its threat. How should we engage in saving the nation through aviation after receiving this profound lesson? Since the European War, aviation technology and construction around the world have been developing day by day, and the fear of aerial terror is growing more and more profound. Therefore, countries are also intensifying their research into air defense. Our country not only has very little construction in aviation, but also pays little attention to and prepares for air defense equipment. If any country goes to war with China, the threat China will face can be easily imagined from the lessons learned last year. Compared to any country, China's current meager number of aircraft is practically zero. Even in terms of the speed of these meager aircraft, our country can only travel 120 miles per hour, while other countries have 180 to 200 miles per hour. In aerial combat, aircraft would only be for capture. However, under today's international situation, silently reflecting, the dangerous situation our country is in, the only way is to actively build national defense, concentrate all the intelligence, materials, and financial resources of the people of the whole country to achieve it. Only by building a solid national defense can we speak of self-defense. But according to the most urgent and relatively quick and easy thing to do in today's military, nothing is better than the air force. China is forced by the recent domestic and foreign situation, and the only way to quickly and actively engage in building aviation power and aerial equipment to strengthen national defense. The establishment of the China Aviation Salvation Association, its purpose is entirely at this point. The National Government recognizes saving the nation through aviation as the most critical plan, so it specially appointed domestic leaders as directors of the association to conduct widespread publicity throughout the country, and renamed it the China Aviation Association, which was established on New Year's Day this year. It has held several board meetings and is now actively preparing to start recruiting members. Colleagues of this government should know the importance of saving the nation through aviation. Now, when the association is soliciting members, it is planned to ask all the staff of this government to actively participate, to be an advocate for the entire city. The association's members are divided into five types: ordinary, special, sponsor, permanent, and group. Please determine each, and be sure to make the association a strong and effective non-governmental aviation organization to assist the government in building the air force to defend the country."</p>

<p>To Be Managed by the Aviation Association</p>
<p>According to Lin Wojang's Talk Yesterday</p>
<p>The Guowen News Agency reports that since the establishment of the China Aviation Association, the first meeting of the Standing Committee has been held. At 3:00 PM today, the Association will hold the second meeting. According to Changwei Lin Wojang, the most important points of the discussion are the issues of soliciting members and the association's address. Because the original address is insufficient, although a new address at 99 Jishi Fei'er Road has been found, the committee members seem to feel that it is too remote, and it may be inconvenient to handle affairs. Also, the government recently stated that in the future, the aircraft donated by the public will be managed by the Association, to be used uniformly.</p>
<p>The Association received a congratulatory telegram from the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission yesterday, which reads: "To Wang Shilin and Wang Lin, Standing Directors of the Shanghai China Aviation Association, and Directors Du Yu, Liu Zhang, Huang Wang, Dai Zhu, Li Chen, Hu Weng, Hu Zhang, and Xiong Zhang, we have received your winter telegram with respect. Developing the aviation industry in order to consolidate national defense and facilitate transportation is indeed the most important plan for saving the country at present. You, gentlemen, either have perseverance or are rich in experience, and are cooperating to promote it. Success is certain. We look forward to your hard work and cannot express our admiration enough. We hereby offer our congratulations and hope that you will take note. Shi Qingyang, Chairman of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission, kowtows. Cold seal."</p>

<p>The Situation of the Northwest Trip</p>
<p>Female aviator Ms. Lin Pengxia, without avoiding the cold and hardship, personally went to the Northwest to investigate culture, politics, transportation, and air routes, in order to carry out on-the-spot development. She has now arrived safely in Lanzhou and has been greatly welcomed by officials and people there. The following is an excerpt from her recent letter to the Aviation Association via airmail: "After a hard journey of thirteen days from Xi'an, I finally arrived in Lanzhou. Chairman Shao and the heads of various departments and divisions all hosted banquets to entertain me, and all sectors welcomed me with great enthusiasm. The whole city was shocked. At the provincial government meeting on New Year's Day, Chairman Shao personally invited me to speak. My ambition here is to develop the border regions and relieve the disaster victims. It also has a great relationship with overseas unemployed overseas Chinese. Shaanxi and Gansu have suffered from drought for a long time, and last year's fields and crops were destroyed by storms. Therefore, there is no rice or wheat everywhere among the people. The natural disaster is severe, and there are also man-made disasters. Villages encountered by bandits are ruins, and the people have nowhere to return, so they mostly wander in the mountains and dare not return to their villages. The people are haggard and there is no life. The weather is now severely cold, and food prices are rising day by day. The disaster victims have reached the end of their ropes and have no way to survive. I cannot bear to witness the tragedy, so I will publicize this situation to all parties, and I hope that benevolent people will find ways to provide relief. I am sending seven tragic photos along the way, which will give you a glimpse. I have decided to sacrifice everything and do my best to rescue the suffering compatriots in the Northwest. Gentlemen, you are enthusiastic about loving the country, and you are willing to help me succeed."</p>
<h3 id="e85">Shanghai-Beiping Aviation Line to Fly North for the Second Time Today <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>Nie Kaiyi to Travel Together to Complete Unfinished Tasks</p>
<p>The China National Aviation Corporation's Shanghai-Beiping air route aircraft returned to Shanghai the day before yesterday. A reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency yesterday visited Nie Kaiyi, director of the airline's aircraft navigation section, and Li Diezhuang, secretary, to inquire about their feelings after the first voyage. According to their answer, the maiden voyage north was delayed to three days due to weather conditions. When heading south, it took off from Beiping at 7:40 AM and arrived in Longhua at 2:40 PM, traveling at 135 miles per hour. The speed of its flight was unexpected. The scheduled time for departure was 7:30 AM and arrival was 5:10 PM. According to the experience of the pilots, the wind direction is more suitable for flying between March and April, and the time can be further shortened. The mail carried southbound reached more than 100 kilograms, Qingdao more than 200 kilograms, and even Haizhou had 70 kilograms, which shows a glimpse of its development. Whether the number of flights will be increased to daily north and south departures will be determined after the second flight. Today at 7:30 AM, it is decided to go north as scheduled. It is driven by Chief Pilot An Lisheng, and Nie Kaiyi, director of the aircraft navigation section, will still travel together. Because the layout of the airports in Haizhou and Qingdao was not perfect due to the rush of the opening time, it is still necessary to build several necessary houses for rest and storage of gasoline and spare parts. The lease contract for the Tianjin airport has not yet been fully signed, and it is also urgent to complete it. Therefore, although Mr. Nie has already felt the hardship of traveling between Shanghai and Beiping last time, he still has to go north to guide and handle the above-mentioned matters.</p>

<p>Fighting the Enemy in the Snow</p>
<p>The Office in Shanghai of the Commander of the Sixth Route Army of the Heat Resistance Against Japan received a telegram from Chaoyang yesterday, stating that Yan Bowei's troops, Wang Zhendong, learned that the Japanese army was gathering in Lingchao and attempting to invade Heat, so they coordinated with Jiang Peiran's army yesterday morning to launch a pincer attack on the Japanese army in Lingchao from the left and right wings. It happened to be snowing heavily this morning, and Wang and Jiang's troops all mustered their spirits and advanced through the snow. When they approached the Japanese army, they launched a fierce assault. Because the snowfall was too heavy, the Japanese army was unprepared, so they all abandoned their guns and fled in disarray. Wang and Jiang's troops were boosted and chased bravely. In this battle, more than 100 enemies were killed, more than 50 were injured, and 5 machine guns, 3 mortars, and more than 80 rifles were captured. The Japanese army has now retreated to Benniu Yingzi and Yuanjiagou.</p>

<h3 id="e89">Lawyers Association Cables Request to Clearly Define the Overall Resistance Plan <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>To Song Dai, President of the Executive Yuan of the National Government, and Jiang, Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission: After seizing our three northeastern provinces, the violent Japanese army, with its pack of wolves and strong armor, has captured Yuguan and is pressing on Rehe. Its ambition to seize North China and ask for the throne of the Central Plains is already clearly revealed. In this autumn of national crisis, resistance is the only way to save the country, and resistance is still not enough to save the country unless the manpower and material resources of the country are concentrated to deal with it. During the European War, the warring countries all turned the peacetime state of the country into a wartime organization in an instant. For example, concentrating cash to stabilize wartime finance, and managing factories to adjust the supply of military supplies. Other personnel services and vacations, the production and distribution of materials, and everything related to the war were all placed under the highest power of the country and suited to the reality of the whole country fighting each other. Our government now sees that the violent Japanese army is becoming more and more rampant, and the country is uniting to resist the insult, showing the people of the country. What is the final use of the financial, financial, industrial, transportation, national, and other mobilization preparations of the whole country's manpower and material resources? Does the government have a plan? Even if the country's strength is insufficient and the situation is very different, the enemy will not allow me to have the spare time to prepare calmly, so I must make a comprehensive plan for what I have now and what can be used temporarily, and make a planned sacrifice. Even more, the Red Bandits are still waiting to be exposed and slaughtered, and the countryside is still waiting to be rescued. How to allocate the national army to clarify the responsibility of external defense and internal suppression, and how to create rural areas and loan money banks to activate the social economy (this association has another concrete construction plan), all of these should be decided decisively and should not be allowed to be involved in hesitation. If the will to resist is not firm, and the overall resistance plan is not established, and the mentality of survival is used to respond to extraordinary events, it will ring when it is attacked, and it will stop when it is placed. Is the future of the country still worth asking? This association has a bone in its throat, and it has to pour it out to our government. It is hoped that you will learn from it and observe it. Thank you very much. Liu Liumin, Jiang Yong, Yan Yinwu, Dai Tianqiu, and Liu Zhe, standing members of the All-China Lawyers Association, kowtow. Cold,</p>

<p>Continue Rescuing Noulens and Chen Peng</p>
<p>After the Chinese Civil Rights League was initiated by Soong Ching Ling, Cai Yuanpei, and others, it has been actively preparing and starting to proceed, establishing branches in Shanghai, Pingjin, Guangzhou, and other places. At the same time, the Noulens Support Association and the Chen Peng Support Association will continue to carry out rescues. The Association also issued two telegrams due to the detention of Huang Pingjun of the Beiping students and the Tianjin Workers' Sports Association, advocating fairness. The details of the various situations are recorded below.</p>
<h3 id="e91">Shanghai Branch Established <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>According to Mr. Lin Yutang, the general manager of the Association, since the preparation of the Association, teachers from schools in various places and various groups have sent letters enthusiastically to participate. Therefore, in today's (16th) meeting, the organization of the Shanghai branch is being discussed, and in the future, branches will be established in major ports such as Tianjin and Guangzhou, so that there will be branches in various places to protect civil rights, which can be directly handled. The Shanghai branch has decided to be formally organized and established tomorrow (17th), and the major ports will continue to proceed separately after Shanghai is established.</p>
<h3 id="e92">Yang Xingfo Speaks <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>According to General Manager Yang Xingfo, the rescue of the Noulens case is still continuing unabated. Although the Noulens couple have been sentenced to life imprisonment, the national law should be lenient in dealing with political prisoners. Therefore, we are still asking the authorities to release the Noulens if they encounter a general amnesty. As for the Chen Peng case, it will be publicly tried by the judicial organs soon. After the Association sent a letter to the authorities in Beiping regarding the Xu Deyan case, it has been approved for submission to the judicial organs for trial. Six or seven people who were arrested at the same time as Xu have been released on bail.</p>

<p>The Association sent a telegram to the Mayor of Beiping, which reads: "To Mayor Zhou of the Beiping Municipal Government and the Director of the Public Security Bureau, we have learned from the news that your bureau arrested dozens of students from various schools in Beiping who attended the Anti-Japanese Conference on the 12th of this month, including six or seven female students. At this time of national crisis, when the enemy is pressing on the border and the country is in danger, every man is responsible for resisting Japan and saving the country. The government should take advantage of the situation to guide the youth. Why should it be destroyed horizontally? If civil rights are not guaranteed, how can the people's morale be extended? We urge you to immediately release the detained students in order to nurture morale and jointly face the national crisis. We also look forward to a reply. Soong Ching Ling and Cai Yuanpei, Chairman and Vice Chairman of the China Civil Rights Protection League, delete."</p>

<p>Another telegram to the Organization Department of the Central Party Headquarters in Nanjing reads: "To the Organization Department of the Central Party Headquarters in Nanjing, according to a letter from Tianjin, Huang Pingjun, who is engaged in the Chinese trade union movement, was arrested in Tianjin by a special commissioner of the Kuomintang on December 14 on suspicion of being a communist and sent to Nanjing to be detained by your department. His whereabouts are still unknown. Huang Jun, no matter what crime he committed, should be handed over to the judicial organs for public trial in order to respect the rule of law and emphasize civil rights. We also hope to indicate the place where Huang Jun is detained in order to dispel the doubts of the masses."</p>

<p>Loyal to Their Duties Under Intense Bombardment</p>
<p>The Zilin News reports that it learned from reliable sources yesterday that the staff of the Chinese Northern Post Office were loyal to their duties and courageous in their work, often braving danger to maintain the details of the Yuguan Post Office. According to reports, since the outbreak of the war in Yuguan, the Post Office staff quickly found ways to restore postal traffic. At present, the post office at the station has been working daily from 9:00 AM to 3:00 PM, and a special place for selling stamps has been set up on the coast of Shanhaiguan to facilitate displaced overseas Chinese. All mail is delivered daily by pound, and all post office staff can work with peace of mind. No one wants to be afraid to leave their jobs until they receive orders. Bureau member Lu Haoming also went to the Japanese army to bomb the south gate, and under the fierce fire of 50 shells per minute, he automatically went to the area to rescue two colleagues who were suffering from illness. At present, the postal affairs in Yuguan District are presided over by a British youth, Darton. It is also heard that on the 4th of this month, a postman was transporting mail to Qinhuangdao, and after being blocked by the Japanese army on the way back, a Westerner named Kush, a customs officer, did not hesitate to take risks and walked from Shanhaiguan to Qinhuangdao to transport it on his behalf. His people are also righteous and courageous. Afterwards, the postal authorities quickly negotiated with the Japanese army to restore the office of the Chinese staff of the post office.</p>
<h3 id="e96">Reasons for Recent High Rice Prices <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>The Guowen News Agency reported yesterday that, according to people in the rice industry, the reasons for the recent surge in rice prices by about two yuan are quite noteworthy. It is heard that in the past, when grain was cheap, the villagers could not wait and sold their goods to seek wealth. Neighboring countries took advantage of our cheap grain and made unscrupulous merchants try to petition the government for grain transport passports, ostensibly to transport grain to Qingdao, Jinan, and other places, but secretly to smuggle it abroad, resulting in a continuous rise in rice prices in recent days, and there is a tendency for it to continue to increase. If it is not stopped in time, I am afraid that there will be insufficient green and yellow in the future. Those who sell their goods to seek wealth today will buy them back at several times the price in the future, and their economic ability will be even more unable to bear it. This is a serious step today, which is enough to create social unrest in the future. Shouldn't the authorities pay close attention to it?</p>
<h3 id="e97">There Is Another Bizarre Electronic Sound of the Missing Yu Long Vessel <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>Between Hong Kong and Hainan Island in Three Days</p>
<p>Insurance Company Asks About the Truth in a Letter</p>
<p>Relief to Family Members of Crew Members First</p>
<p>After the missing Yu Long vessel, which was represented by the Tongyu Shipping Company, the company yesterday sent a letter to the Jianghai Customs to forward it to the customs of various ports for investigation. The families of the crew members will be given advances on their wages to comfort them. There are still vessels passing between Hong Kong and Qiongzhou Island that have received radio transmissions from the Yu Long vessel. The bizarreness of the incident is unprecedented. The details are as follows.</p>
<h3 id="e98">History of Yu Long <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>The Yu Long vessel has a deadweight tonnage of 2,700 tons and a net cargo tonnage of 2,400 tons. It was manufactured in the United Kingdom in 1892 and purchased by a Norwegian merchant of the Yu Long Shipping Company, valued at 100,000 taels. It is represented by the Tongyu Shipping Company. The shipowner is Norwegian, Yal Sheng, the chief mate is Xu Shanming, and the chief mechanic is Qi Xinyu. This time, it was repaired in Shanghai and a new furnace was installed. At the end of November, it sailed from Shanghai to Hongji in Annam to load Hongji coal. It went missing after sailing out of Hongji on December 8.</p>
<h3 id="e99">Bizarre Track <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>The company entrusted the International Radio Station of the Ministry of Communications to forward it to the Yu Long vessel by radio, but there was no response. The Hong Kong Radio Station is now continuing to search for it by radio. On the 2nd of this month, the Yingping vessel of the Yingping Company received a radio transmission from the Yu Long vessel between Hong Kong and Hainan Island, reporting only the name of the vessel, and then it was cut off. On the 3rd of this month, the Fengxiang vessel of the Yongping Company also received a radio transmission from Yu Long, reporting only the name of the vessel, which was the same as the Yingping vessel. Therefore, after the company received the notification, it felt that the incident was bizarre and could not guess the truth.</p>

<p>The Tongyu Company, based on the ship names connected by the telegrams from Yingping and other vessels, predicted that the vessel may not have sunk. Yesterday, it sent a special letter to the Shanghai Jianghai Customs, asking it to forward it to ports such as Xiamen, Hong Kong, Guangdong, Shantou, and Kowloon to investigate the traces of the Yu Long vessel.</p>
<h3 id="e101">Previously Insured <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>A reporter from Xinsheng News Agency met with the company's accountant yesterday, who said that the purchase price of the Yu Long vessel was 100,000 taels, and it was insured by three companies, Zhaotai, Huaan, and Lianbao, totaling 50,000 taels. The Hongji coal it loaded was worth about 30,000 yuan. Yesterday, the Zhaolong and other insurance companies all sent letters inquiring about the truth.</p>

<p>The entire crew of the vessel is about 40 people. The families of the crew members continued to go to the company at 9:00 AM yesterday to plead for relief. Chen Yisheng, the manager of the company, in view of the suffering of the families, gave each person an advance on their salary for one and a half months yesterday to provide relief. After receiving the money at 12:00 AM, the families of the crew members dispersed.</p>

<p>Since the January 28th Incident, all residential buildings and roads in Zhabei, Shanghai, have been almost completely destroyed. Recently, the Ministry of Railways decided to relocate the North Railway Station, so the municipal government believes that the original road system needs to be changed.

The 216th municipal meeting approved it and sent it to the Ministry of Railways for review. It is learned that the Ministry of Railways has handed it over to road experts for review and found it usable. Therefore, it replied to the municipal government the day before yesterday.

<p>And Visit Central Committee Members in Guangdong and Hong Kong Along the Way</p>
<p>A reporter from the Central News Agency visited Huang Shaoxiong, the Minister of Interior, at his residence yesterday. According to him, in order to quickly realize local autonomy, the Ministry of Interior will divide the counties of each province into several autonomous experimental zones and implement them separately, so that it is easier to achieve results. Guangxi Province has already implemented this method, so he is scheduled to go there at the end of this month or early next month to inspect the implementation results and investigate the economic conditions of the province. During this trip to the south, he will pass through Hong Kong and Guangzhou and visit the Central Committee members in Guangdong and Hong Kong for consultations. The issue of resisting aggression will also be consulted. He will return north in about three weeks. As for all the resolutions of the National Interior Affairs Conference, they are being sorted out and will be promulgated and implemented soon, in order to achieve them as soon as possible.

<p>The Institute of Social Sciences of the National Academia Sinica is one of the research institutions of the Academia Sinica. It was established at the end of 1927 and has been in existence for five years. In previous years, due to the lack of a fixed address, it moved between Beijing and Shanghai several times. It was not until the spring of last year that a new site was determined on the southeast side of Qintian Mountain in Nanjing. Construction was completed at the end of the year. All departments of the institute moved in from Shanghai one after another this spring. The director of the institute was originally concurrently held by the president of the Academia Sinica, Cai Yuanpei. Recently, President Cai has been busy with affairs and has appointed Yang Xingfo, the director-general of the Academia Sinica, to concurrently serve as director. The latest news from the institute is summarized below: 1) Facilities: The institute's building is a steel-and-concrete convex-shaped building located on the southeast side of Qintian Mountain in Nanjing, in front of Jiming Temple. The environment is quiet and the scenery is excellent, making it a good place for retreat and cultivation. It has a library with three floors, which can hold 100,000 volumes. The library's books are mainly in the social sciences. Over the years, it has been actively collecting books. As of the end of June of this year, it has reached 65,735 volumes, including 27,497 volumes of Chinese and Japanese books, 11,086 volumes of Western books, 16,746 volumes of Chinese and Japanese magazines and gazettes, and 10,406 volumes of Western magazines and gazettes. In addition, there are many instruments and specimens, including 11 kinds of anthropometric instruments for ethnology, 3 kinds of cameras, a magic lantern, more than 100 ethnic films, more than 700 ethnic specimens, and hundreds of charts and photographs. Last winter, in order to collect local chronicles from all over China, a large-scale solicitation was sent to local governments in various provinces, cities, and counties across the country.

<p>Avoiding Those Who Use Real Estate as a Business or Their Representatives</p>
<p>The Shanghai Settlement Chinese Ratepayers Association held its third executive committee meeting at 4:00 PM yesterday afternoon. The committee members present were Wang Xiaolai, Xu Jiqi, Wang Hanliang, Wu Yunzhai, Hu Fengxiang, Shen Tianxin, Zhang Yichen, Chen Jicheng, Fei Yunqing, Chen Zeqing, Chinese Directors Yu Qiaqing, Xu Xinliu, Bei Songsun, Chinese Committee Member Lin Kanghou, Secretaries Yan Esheng, and Tao Leqin, totaling more than 20 people. Chairman Wang Xiaolai presided over the meeting. After performing the rituals, Secretary Tao Leqin first reported on: 1) the previous resolutions, 2) the status of negotiations on telephone price increases, 3) the status of negotiations on the increase in water fees for water meter installation, 4) the electricity company's excuse to forcibly collect electricity fees, 5) a letter of commendation to the staff of the Shanghai Municipal Police for cracking the electricity fee case and rescuing the kidnapped person. The issue of the Land Committee of the Public Works Department was then discussed. The municipal government's letter was very gratifying regarding the limited method that the abandonment of the Public Works Department must be agreed upon by the Public Works Department after consultation. The association will avoid selecting those who use real estate as a business or their representatives as candidates for the Land Committee. As for the procedures, they should be handled in the same way as the recognition and addition of Chinese directors by the diplomatic corps and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Local Association notified all members yesterday, saying, "Dear Sirs, the association believes that foreign goods are flooding the market and the national strength is declining. Therefore, it has jointly launched with the National Products Machinery Factory Federation and the National Products Production and Sales Cooperative Association to make this year the National Products Year and hold a National Products Parade on New Year's Day to arouse national attention. Soon after, member Yu Rizhang came to Shanghai from Washington, D.C., and strongly advocated resisting enemy goods. Yan Esheng also replied, requesting that members of the association take the lead in using national products as an example. This was submitted to the board meeting on the 10th of this month, and everyone agreed that with the enemy's aggression intensifying day by day, in addition to military resistance, a long-term economic boycott is necessary to defeat them. The members of the association have always shouldered local expectations, and every move is related to the views of the masses. Mr. Yan's words are indeed the key to the plan. It was resolved to send a letter to inform you, respectfully hoping that you will take the lead in promoting the use of national products in household clothing, utensils, and food, and widely persuade relatives and friends to shift the atmosphere and reverse the decline. The lifeline of the Republic of China depends on it. This is a special announcement, wishing you well."</p>

<p>To Support the Anti-Japanese Righteous Army</p>
<p>The Shanghai National Products Factory Federation sent letters to various factories yesterday to solicit donations to help the Northeast. The letter read, "Dear Sirs, with the fall of Yuguan and the turmoil in North China, Rehe, Jiumentou, and Qinhuangdao are all in a state of emergency. The righteous army is relying on blood and flesh to fight in the icy and snowy land, fighting for China's survival and for the nation's personality. Our people in the rear, in view of the tragic bombing, burning, and killing of the January 28th Wusong Zhabei by the Japanese pirates, the strength of the righteous army fighting against Japan in Rehe is far less than that of the 19th Route Army, but they have been fighting for more than a year. How loyal and brave are they? Therefore, at the previous executive committee meeting of the association, it was resolved to urge all factories to donate one day's wages from workers every month, starting in January, until the lost territories in the Northeast are recovered. The factory will also donate an equal amount as the total donation from the workers for one day to help the righteous army in the Rehe area fight against the enemy. The amount donated by each factory each month will be reported to the association for verification. The donations will be sent to the bank for deposit (the bank will be designated and notified later). An economic committee will be organized to preside over the matter, so that the funds will not be wasted and the matter will be practical. We have recorded it in the minutes, and we are now urgently recording the case and sending a letter to your factory for verification. According to the righteousness that every man is responsible for the rise and fall of the world, we sincerely urge the workers to implement it as soon as possible, in order to save the country and avenge the country. We will not bear the burden."</p>

<p>Another 20,000 Yuan Was Remitted Yesterday</p>
<p>The variety show for the relief of Northeast refugees launched by the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, the General Labour Union, the Certified Public Accountants Association, and the Lawyers Association has been actively handling the closing matters in recent days since its closing on the 8th. Once the handling is completed, it will be submitted to the Certified Public Accountants Association for audit and announcement. Because the violence of the Japanese invaders has ravaged Shanhaiguan and plotted to attack Rehe, the scope of the refugees going to righteousness has expanded even more. In order to do their best to help the refugees going to righteousness to resist, the association has already remitted 30,000 yuan to General Zhu Qinglan through the Northeast Refugee Relief Association. Yesterday, it allocated another 20,000 yuan to the Northeast Refugee Relief Association to be remitted to General Zhu for proper distribution.</p>
<h3 id="e116">The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Takeover of the Yangtze Wharf Issue <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>Should Be Resolved Within This Month</p>
<p>Yang Zhixiong, the managing director of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, told a reporter from the Central News Agency yesterday that the issue of the company taking over the Yangtze Wharf should be resolved within this month. The wharf was leased to the Haiyang Company by the previous director. The land of the wharf belongs to the company, while the warehouses belong to German merchants. After the expiration, it has been recovered by the Ministry of Communications. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company hopes to manage the wharf to develop shipping. Moreover, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company is a state-owned enterprise, so there is no problem. However, in order for the company to take over, it must repay the 240,000 taels advanced by the Ministry of Communications when it recovered the wharf. It is currently negotiating with the Ministry of Communications whether the transfer will be made by transferring accounts between the two parties or by paying in cash, which is only a procedural matter. The Yangtze Wharf is close to the Central Wharf. In the future, after the company takes over the construction of warehouses and deepens the waterway, the wharf business can be expected to develop.</p>

<p>The China Jisheng Association recently received a report from Deng County, stating that Deng County is located in the extreme southwest border of Henan Province and has long been a den of bandits. Villages in the western half have been reduced to ruins and overgrown with weeds. There are more than 8,000 hectares of uncultivated land. The people have long been unable to make a living. Last summer, all rivers overflowed and torrential rains continued for 57 days. The autumn harvest failed completely. Subsequently, epidemics broke out and tens of thousands died. Droughts ravaged the area and sowing was disrupted. The wheat season this year only yielded 20%. Between summer and autumn, there was no rain in the northwest of the county for several months, and there was no autumn harvest at all. Although some areas in the southeast were slightly moistened by rain, the harvest was not even 30%. A small number of wheat and beans were sown, but gradually withered. In addition, large groups of roving bandits such as Zhang Laoliu, Wei Guozhu, and Wang Tai ravaged the area, and tens of thousands of communist bandits led by Xu Xiangqian disturbed the area. All kinds of disasters have been experienced, and the households are empty. The burden on the people of Deng is very heavy, and the plight is unimaginable. Currently, people in the north of the county are dismantling houses for those who transport and sell them in counties such as Neixiang and Zhenping. Villagers in various districts and townships are asking the districts for relief, and those who flee to beg for food are endless. In each township, there are households that cannot obtain a single meal all day long. Everywhere you look, there are old and young men and women, crying out in hunger, which is unbearable to hear. The state of waiting for death is unbearable to see. Starving people are often seen. In this severe winter, how can there be any survivors? The public earnestly requests your association to have pity on the special disasters and sufferings of Deng County, which are not found in other counties, and quickly allocate huge sums of money to provide relief. The association is currently receiving letters and documents reporting tragic disasters, which are pouring in like snowflakes and cannot be dealt with. It is hoped that charitable comrades at home and abroad will have compassion for this catastrophe, make a vow to save people, and create immeasurable blessings.</p>
<h3 id="e118">Ningbo Fellow Countrymen's Association Resolves Opinions on Clearing Sand Fields <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>Telegram to the Chairman of Zhejiang Province</p>
<p>The Ningbo Fellow Countrymen's Association in Shanghai believes that the former Ningchen Sand Field Branch violated the regulations of the Ministry and disposed of privately-owned sand fields without authorization, causing disputes. Yesterday, it telegraphed the Zhejiang Provincial Government to state its opinions on the resolution. The telegram read, "To Chairman Lu of the Zhejiang Provincial Government in Hangzhou, we have received a copy of the proposed methods for clearing sand fields, making up for deficiencies, and resolving issues issued by the Department of Civil Affairs. After inviting fellow countrymen to the association to view it, everyone believed that the proposed methods of the Department of Civil Affairs excessively focused on facts and did not effectively correct the failure of the former Ning County Sand Field Branch to comply with the regulations of the Ministry, causing all kinds of disputes. Now, after discussion by the association, the following opinions are put forward: 1) All regulations and detailed rules of the Ministry's order for Zhejiang Province to clear sand fields must be strictly followed by the county bureaus in the future and shall not be invoked with specially approved cases, so that the people have nowhere to turn. 2) The scope of handling sand fields should still strictly follow the regulations of the Ministry, and the procedures for the county bureau should be followed. 3) All cases that have been sold by tender should be declared invalid because the branch did not implement the statutory procedures. Therefore, we telegraphed the chairman for your assessment, vigorously presided over the matter, to emphasize merit and prevent disputes."</p>

<h3 id="e122">Director Huang Rectifies Passenger Transportation on Two Railways <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>The Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways have more than 45,000 passengers traveling daily. Passenger transport has always been the largest source of income for the railways. Since taking office, Director Huang Boqiao has realized that the waterways of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces are convenient for transportation, and competition is extremely fierce. He is deeply concerned that if the management and response are slightly inappropriate, passengers will abandon the railways for ships, affecting passenger transport. It is reported that he has ordered the Traffic Department and the Police Department to pay special attention and supervise their subordinates. All station staff and railway police who have daily contact with passengers should do their best, sincerely and humbly, to provide convenience for passengers at all times and places. They must answer inquiries in detail, take good care of requests, accept arguments with moderation, and provide assistance in times of danger. It is forbidden to show arrogance or anger, use rude words or harsh voices, so that passengers do not see the two railways as a fearful journey, regard them as bureaucratic, and tarnish the reputation of the railways. He has also secretly sent officers to conduct strict inspections at any time. Furthermore, the number of passengers in third and fourth-class carriages on the two railways is the largest, but the crowding of seats, the simplicity of equipment, the lack of attention to cleanliness, and the lack of uniformity in appearance are most prominent in third and fourth-class carriages, which inevitably causes passenger complaints. It is reported that Director Huang ordered the Traffic and Mechanical Departments yesterday to discuss a plan and find ways to rectify the situation, so that passengers will feel comfortable and convenient, thoroughly develop the spirit of commercialization and popularization, and achieve the mission of the two railways as a state-owned transportation enterprise.</p>

<p>Fu Meizhen, a woman from Ningbo, is 29 years old, with delicate features. Her home is located at an unmarked address in Chenjiadu, Zhoujiaqiao, West Shanghai. She graduated from Chendu Elementary School there. Recently, due to abuse by her stepmother, she was betrothed to a man surnamed Zhu. In September of this year, she fell in love with Shi Shoudao, a 23-year-old clerk from Chongming at the nearby Yucheng Sauce Garden. They fell in love at first sight, and Shi lured her to a room in the Asia Hotel on Hankou Road. They had a physical relationship once and then made a vow of eternal love. However, Shi was already married and his parents were very strict. Later, the owner of Yucheng Garden found out and fired him. Shi and Fu Meizhen could not achieve their goal of getting married. Later, he opened a room alone in the Asia Hotel and attempted suicide by poison, but was rescued by his elder brother and taken home. However, he could not sever his love with Miss Fu, and they often exchanged letters or met to talk on the road. However, Miss Fu already had a fiancé, and Shi also had a wife at home. After discussing it between themselves, they sighed and cried, unable to think of a solution. On the tenth of this month, Shi Shoudao bought one and a half yuan of American opium in a village and secretly agreed to meet Miss Fu at Room 23 of the Kunming Hotel at No. 35 Kunming Road. Shi explained his feelings to Fu Meizhen and wrote several suicide notes. In his suicide note, Shi Shoudao stated the reasons for his suicide: 1. I committed bigamy. 2. I am obstructed by my parents. 3. I wish to be buried with Fu Meizhen after death. He also wrote two elegiac couplets: 1. "Two hearts were willing but could not be together, Huai'an (i.e., Miss Meizhen) is famous as a dazzling pearl, Farewell, my affectionate younger sister." 2. "Dying together and being buried together is a grand reunion, Life is a dream, respectfully by Shi Shoudao, an unrighteous person." After these two couplets were completed, one was placed on each coffin. Then, they divided the raw opium in half and ate it before going to sleep. Unexpectedly, they vomited almost everything out after a while. They thought they could not commit suicide in Room 23, so they changed to Room 28 the next morning. Shi went to the village again to buy three more pieces of opium Yuan and brought them back to the hotel. That night, the two continued to take the drug and slept in the same bed, waiting for death. At around 11:00 AM early the next morning (i.e., the 12th), Song Baofang, a tea waiter at the hotel, knocked on the door, intending to clean the room, but there was no response. Realizing something was wrong, he used a kitchen knife to pry open the door. He was shocked to see them lying stiff on the bed. Miss Fu was lying face down, her complexion already gray. Shi Shoudao had a trouser belt tied around his neck, his eyes closed and silent. Song first untied the belt, pushed him, but he did not speak, but his body was still warm. He then reported to the front desk and telegraphed Huishan Patrol Room, which sent Chinese detective Xu Shutian and Western detective to rush to the scene. Shi Shoudao was taken to Tongren Hospital, and the woman, Fu Meizhen, was taken to Shanghai Convalescent Hospital on Old Baffle Road for treatment. Fortunately, it was not too late, and emetic medicine was used to vomit out the opium juice. They gradually recovered the day before yesterday, and Shi Shoudao was taken into custody in the patrol room. Fu Meizhen was taken back by her father, Fu Quanyou. Yesterday morning, the patrol room sent Shi Shoudao to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Zhang Tianyin, the patrol room lawyer, stated the previous situation and claimed that the patrol room had filed public charges on the two counts of seduction and instigation of suicide. He presented the confiscated suicide note, elegiac couplets, trouser belts, etc. for investigation. Then, Song Baofang, the tea waiter at Kunming Hotel, testified about what had happened. Fu Quanyou also testified that he had four sons and three daughters with his previous wife, and Meizhen was the youngest. His current wife, Yin, had been married for ten years and also had a daughter. Meizhen was indeed betrothed to a man surnamed Zhu. He did not know about her relationship with the defendant. In September, the daughter did not return home for one night, claiming to have stayed at her sister's place, so he did not ask in detail. A few days ago, the daughter went shopping and did not return. Later, he saw it reported in the newspaper and knew about it. He went to the hospital to pick up his daughter, etc. The woman, Fu Meizhen, wearing a patriotic cloth cheongsam and civilized satin shoes, hung her head and said that the defendant had asked her to go to the hotel to commit suicide, so she had to obey. Shi Shoudao confessed that he committed suicide with the woman because he had no face to see his parents, so he took this action. He asked for consideration. After Judge Shen Bingrong gave a sincere warning to both parties, he ordered them to start the debate and then ordered them to be remanded in custody and a date set for sentencing. He also ordered Fu Quanyou to take his daughter back and advise her, and not to beat her.</p>
<h3 id="e126">Clerk Sees a Large Sum of Money and Gets Evil Intentions, Embezzles Funds and Falsely Reports Being Kidnapped <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>Covered Hands and Feet with Mud</p>
<p>Lies Thrown into the River</p>
<p>Accomplice Has Also Been Arrested</p>
<p>But the Stolen Money Is Still Missing</p>
<p>At around 12:00 AM on Saturday night, a man from Jiangbei, Lü Wenbiao, reported to the Xinza Patrol Room that he was passing by the entrance of Siwenli on Xinza Road when he was suddenly encountered by two kidnappers who threatened him with guns, dragged him onto a car, covered his head with a coat, and drove quickly into the countryside. They robbed him of more than 1,000 yuan in cash and silver he was carrying, tied his feet with rope, and threw him into a river. Later, he untied the ropes himself and came to the patrol room to report, etc. Western Detective Chief Bao Tai, Chinese Detective Zhao Fuhai, and Detective Bao Derong found Lü's words suspicious, and there was only a little mud on one hand and one foot. They took Lü to investigate in the Siwenli area, and there was no kidnapping. Under strict questioning, he finally confessed to embezzling public funds and falsely reporting a robbery. According to Lü, he was 27 years old and lived at No. 62 Taiyang Temple, Zhabei. He was a clerk at the Japanese-owned Harada Shanghai Branch at No. 362 Zhafu Road, earning a monthly salary of 18 yuan. At 11:30 AM on the 14th of this month, a Japanese man named Harada gave Lü a check for 1,353 taels, 3 mace, and 7 fen from the Yokohama Specie Bank in Shanghai, instructing him to deliver goods at Siwenli, Datong Road. He met a friend named Xu Zirong on the way and had an evil idea. Lü's monthly salary was not enough to cover his expenses, and now that he had a large sum of money on him, he might as well embezzle it privately and spend it, and then find a way to report the robbery to the patrol room, so that the shopkeeper could be deceived. Lü was blinded by greed and acted recklessly. Lü and Xu went to the Yokohama Specie Bank in Shanghai. Xu waited outside the door, and Lü went inside and received a silver note for 500 taels, and the rest was in cash. He walked out of the bank and handed all the money to Xu Zirong, agreeing to meet at the Santai Inn on Jiujiang Road in the evening to divide the money, and then they dispersed. Lü went home, rode a bicycle to the side of Xiaohang behind the Yong'an Yarn Factory on Changping Road in West Shanghai, tied his feet with rope, walked towards the riverbank, and then smeared mud on his hands and feet, and then untied the rope and reported to the patrol room, etc. The Chinese and Western detectives arrested Xu Zirong, but Xu denied it. Lü and Xu were both taken into custody and sent to the Simple Court of the First Special District Court yesterday morning. Qian Xunjiu, the lawyer for the patrol room, detailed the above situation and stated that the stolen money was still missing, so he requested permission to postpone the investigation. Bao Tai, the western detective, then complained about the investigation. Judge Zhan Liangce examined the confession and ordered Lü and Xu to be detained and interrogated again in seven days after the investigation was completed.</p>
<h3 id="e127">Murderer Executed by Hanging <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>Zhang Zimei Recalls His Wife and Children Before Death</p>
<p>Sends a Letter Asking His Uncle to Take Care of Them</p>
<p>Jiang Haitao, who was previously employed as a driver at the First Special District Court, lived at No. 130 Shanjia Garden, Guling Road. At 8:30 AM on September 15 of last year, Jiang went from his home to the court to handle business. Before he had walked a few steps, he was suddenly stabbed several times by his enemy, Zhang Zimei, with a sharp knife. Because the injuries were to vital points, he died on the spot. The murderer was caught on the spot, sent to the First Special Court for interrogation, and the facts were clear. Zhang Zimei was sentenced to death and reported to the Jiangsu Provincial Government for approval. Yesterday afternoon, the date for execution had arrived. The Xinza Patrol Room sent detectives to escort Zhang to the Third Criminal Court of the Special Court. Judge Shen Shanzeng ascended the seat and announced to Zhang that he had been ordered to carry out the death penalty today. He asked him if he had any last words for his family. Zhang said that he was 31 years old, from Tongzhou, and had previously worked as a driver. He lived on Kangnaidao Road, had a wife and two children, and asked if his uncle could be brought in for a face-to-face conversation. As there was not enough time, the court wrote a letter on his behalf, notifying Zhang Aliang, a driver at the Gordon Road Patrol Room (i.e., his uncle), asking him to take care of his wife and children, and he had nothing else to say. Judge Shen ordered him to be sent to the Local Court for execution. The Chinese and Western detectives then took Zhang down, along with the case file and photos, and escorted him by car directly to the Caohiejing execution ground. The Procuratorate of the Local Court was also notified to send a prosecutor to supervise the execution of the law enforcement police on the spot. After re-examining Zhang, he was ordered to be executed. Because Zhang was convicted of murder, he was to be hanged as an example, and the body exposed overnight, and a coffin prepared the next day for burial.</p>
<h3 id="e128">Many Poor People in Shelters Due to Severe Wind and Snow <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>Rice Prices Soar, Funding is Difficult</p>
<p>The Shanghai Charity Organizations Federation requested donations to cover expenses for the Second Congee Kitchen opened by the Zhabei Charity Association. It was replied in a letter to Wang Binyan, Director of the Association, stating that the Shelters currently operated by the Federation already house more than 3,000 people, while donations are scarce and funding is extremely difficult. However, considering that the Congee Kitchen operated by the Association is also for the relief of the poor, the Federation reluctantly donated 1,000 yuan from its limited resources for assistance. It is hoped that the Association will take note of this. It is reported that the Federation's Shelter at the South Railway Station has received more than 400 more people in recent days, bringing the total to more than 3,500. Recently, rice prices have risen by about two yuan. The Shelter's funding is difficult. In this time of rain, snow, and severe cold, the poor are suffering from hunger and cold. It is hoped that all philanthropists will donate generously to provide relief. In addition, the Association has continued to receive 2,000 yuan from the Shanghai Charity Association, 1,000 yuan from the Morality General Association, 100 yuan from the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company, 30 yuan from Mr. Liang of Guangchengxing, 20 yuan from the Nantao Church, and 50 pairs of old cotton pants donated by the Shanghai South Charity Association. Furthermore, during the previous general meeting of the Association, Mr. Wang Junsheng of Pushan Villa proposed that since Hartung had passed away, it was planned to take out one million yuan from his estate to allocate to various charities to specifically run charitable事业. Now, more than a year has passed, and there has been no news about the allocation of funds. Currently, the social situation is such that there are more and more poor people and more and more unemployed. If the Hartung family can allocate a large sum of money, either to run a factory specifically or to expand existing local businesses to provide relief, it would be a blessing for society and a blessing for the poor. After discussion, a letter was sent to inquire with Mr. Xu Qianlin and Mr. Xie Hengchuang on record. According to the reply from Xu Qianlin, a letter was received regarding the issue of contacting Hartung's estate for donations. After consultation with Mr. Hengchuang, the matter was delayed due to his family disputes not being completely resolved. It is now planned to wait a little longer and then go with Mr. Heng to see if more assistance can be obtained. If not, they will try their best to persuade him so that there is no hope. A corresponding letter is replied for you to take note.</p>

<p>Most Ice Obstructions are Near Gaodian</p>
<p>Various Shipping Companies Have Sent Ships to Break the Ice</p>
<p>Since the 13th of this month, the weather in Shanghai has been severely cold. The cold and ice in the Suzhou and Changzhou area is even worse, and there is also more snow. The reporter happened to go to Suzhou on that day. From the 14th, the small steamers on the Suzhou-Shanghai, Shanghai-Wuxi, Dangkou routes, as well as the Shanghai-Changzhou-Yixing-Jiangyin routes, were completely blocked by ice and could not operate. The inland water transportation from Shanghai to Suzhou, Wuxi, Changshu, Dangkou, etc., has been completely cut off by ice. On the 14th, the reporter planned to go to Wuxi from Suzhou, but because all inland waterway民船 and航轮 were completely suspended, there was no way to return to his hometown. More than a hundred ships and passenger craft were frozen mid-journey, and as a result, it was difficult for them to advance or retreat. Since the 14th, ships carrying rice, livestock, vegetables, etc., from various towns have been cut off from Suzhou and Shanghai. Fortunately, the small steamers on the Zhejiang routes to Shanghai are still open, so there are still a few rice boats reaching Shanghai. Yesterday, the reporter went to various inland waterway Shipping Companies to inquire. It was said that the Shanghai-Suzhou, Shanghai-Wuxi, Shanghai-Changshu, and Dangkou boats were still blocked by ice and could not pass. Among the blocked inland waterways, the most ice obstructions were near Gaodian. It has been four days and there is still no hope of thawing and通行. Currently, the various shipping companies have sent a large number of ships to the ice-obstructed area to break the ice, intending to use this gradually warming weather to open航道. They are also planning to transship a large number of stranded passengers. Also, fearing that the journey will not be peaceful at the end of the year, and that there will be unexpected dangers to the stranded ships, the Jiangsu Inland Water Police have been asked to send ships to protect them.</p>

<h3 id="e131">The Case of Robbery of a Large Amount of Cotton in the Suzhou Creek at Van Royal Ferry is Solved <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>Recovered the Original Cotton</p>
<p>The Fence Also Arrested</p>
<p>Mitsui &amp; Co., a Japanese firm, hired a large barge belonging to boat owner Ding Guantong on the 12th of this month. They loaded 110 bales of cotton, valued at 15,600 gold dollars, from the Hongsheng Warehouse in Pudong. The barge sailed to the Suzhou Creek in front of the Toyota Spinning Mill at the east end of Zhongshan Road in the West of Shanghai and moored there. They planned to unload the cotton at the Toyota Spinning Mill the next day. However, due to heavy snow and ice, unloading was difficult, and it was decided to deliver the cotton on the 14th. Unexpectedly, at 1:10 AM on the 13th, more than a dozen robbers suddenly appeared, tied up the boat owner and crew, and locked them in the rear cabin. They also dragged the escorting petition policeman, Li Xiaolian, ashore. Then, they sailed the boat to a location near the barracks. Seventy-two bales of cotton were robbed, loaded onto a truck, and the robbers fled. Afterwards, the boat owner reported the robbery to the Sixth District Public Security Bureau and requested the arrest of the thieves and the recovery of the stolen goods. This was previously reported. Recently, detectives from the City Public Security Bureau discovered that the robbers were hiding in Room 22 of the Chunjiang Hotel in the vegetable market street of the French Concession. The detectives rushed to the French Concession Police Department to request assistance in the arrest. Inspector Jin Jiulin, along with detective Zhang Ziqiao and others, went to the Chunjiang Hotel and arrested a robber named Wu Desheng. Wu confessed that he had sold all the stolen goods to Sun Hongcai, a resident of Haimen Road in Weier Meng Road. The detectives then arrested Sun and the doorman, Gong Yilin, and recovered the original 72 bales of stolen cotton, bringing them to the police station. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special Court. First, Yuan Jiahan, a lawyer from the police station, presented the case, stating that the defendants Sun Hongcai and Gong Yilin had committed the crime of receiving stolen goods under Article 376 of the Criminal Law and requested an investigation. Then, a detective from the Public Security Bureau described the circumstances of the robbery and requested permission to transfer the defendants to their custody for interrogation. During the interrogation, Sun Hongcai confessed that Wu Desheng had transported the cotton to his residence as collateral for 3,000 yuan, and he was unaware that it was stolen. Gong Yilin confessed that he was just a doorman and did not dare to help receive stolen goods. Wu Desheng confessed that boat owner Ding Guantong had entrusted him to sell the cotton on his behalf and that he had sold it to Sun Hongcai for 3,000 yuan. Judge Xiong verified the confessions and asked the police station lawyer for his opinion on the Public Security Bureau's request to transfer the defendants. Lawyer Yuan replied that the police station would not object if the Public Security Bureau sent an official document to request the transfer. At this point, the court ordered the defendants to be returned to custody and scheduled another hearing for the 19th. The court also ordered the Public Security Bureau to submit an official document to the court for review.</p>

<p>The Joint Association of Rice Merchants of Jiangsu, Nanjing, and Shanghai held its 15th Standing Committee Meeting of the second session yesterday at 2:00 PM in Cuixiu Hall. The committee members present were Zhu Zixiang, Zhao Zixin, Lu Zhuqing, Qian Jingsheng, Zhu Zhaoqi, Gong Zhaoming, Fu Qiangeng, Yan Xiaoquan, Lu Gongquan, (Zhu Zixiang substituting), Pang Bosen (Yan Xiaoquan substituting), Li Zhongchen (Zhao Zixin substituting), Zhang Nianxuan (Gong Zhaoming substituting), Cai Yukun, and thirteen others. Zhao Zixin chaired the meeting, and the usual procedures were followed. Committee member Zhu Zixiang proposed that the Shanghai Rice Merchants Association would implement a new system of measurement starting February 1st, with the original Haihu reduced by 15%. The same standard should be applied to merchants in the inland to avoid disputes. The chairman then stated that the Xidi measurement was almost the same as the new Shanghai standard, and a slight modification of the old measurement could be applied, which would save a lot of money. However, only a few merchants from the inland, such as Wuxi, were present today, and a circular should be sent to all members to make slight changes according to the new Shanghai standard to ensure consistency. The proposal was approved and passed. Then, Committee member Zhu reported on the 21st year's income and expenditure accounts and future methods of increasing revenue and reducing expenditure. The committee members felt that with the closure of the meeting approaching, the tasks were too numerous and complicated to be resolved hastily, and the matter should be discussed again at the next Standing Committee meeting.</p>

<p>According to past practice, if employees of the China Electric Company became ill due to their work and needed to take leave for medical treatment, the company would provide preferential treatment, stipulating that the company would be responsible for medical expenses. However, the expense claims had to be signed by General Manager Lu of the company before a worker could obtain the medicine from the pharmacy. Yesterday afternoon, at about 1:00 PM, Chen Sanyi, the foreman of the company's cold-working shop, had a prescription with medicine expenses totaling about 20 yuan. He went to General Manager Lu for signature, but after reviewing the prescription, General Manager Lu refused to sign because the prescription was for tonics and supplements. Unexpectedly, the foreman Chen Sanyi became enraged in the general manager's office, smashing the glass window. At that time, a certain member of the labor union and the police team stationed at the company tried to persuade him, but Chen still refused to comply. Subsequently, the company notified the Second District by telephone, and District Chief Jin, along with Officer Fan and a police officer, rushed to the company and took the foreman Chen Sanyi to the district for interrogation.</p>

<p>After the founder Huang Chujiu passed away, the Shanghai Riyue Bank and the Gongfa Company both went bankrupt. Creditors filed lawsuits in the Civil Court of the former French Concession Court, requesting to recover their deposits. The court appointed accountants Pan Zhaobang and Wu to liquidate all the accounts of the bank and the company. It was discovered that the account books of the Riyue Bank had been tampered with by the manager Chen Zhiquan, the accountant Chen Yuqing, Chen Xunqing, and Huang Xianzhong through collusion and embezzlement of funds. The accountants then filed a criminal lawsuit with the court, accusing Chen and the other three. The trial was not concluded, and the Second Special District Court was established to take over the case files and continue the trial. Because the lawsuit was initiated by the accountants, it did not comply with the litigation procedure. The creditors then legally initiated a private prosecution, accusing Chen and the other three of forging documents, embezzlement, and other crimes. After the trial concluded, the defendants were found not guilty because their actions had not affected the creditors' rights. The plaintiffs, the creditors, were dissatisfied with the verdict and, through their lawyers Xu Yannian and others, filed an appeal with the Third Branch of the Jiangsu High Court. The High Court, based on the appeal, summoned the original case files and first summoned the defendants to open an investigation court. After the interrogation was completed, the court summoned both parties yesterday afternoon. Presiding Judge Zhou, along with judges Guo and Zhu, and the prosecutor, convened a collegiate court for trial. Qin Zemin, a lawyer representing the creditor group, stated the intent of the prosecution. Then, lawyers Xu Yannian, Yan Luqing, Dong Chi, and others spoke successively, stating the circumstances of the case. The officials then interrogated the defendants Chen Zhiquan and others and also summoned accountant Pan to be questioned about the discovery of the tampering of the account books and the embezzlement. The court then ordered the debate to begin. After the lawyers for the plaintiffs debated, the defendants were defended by lawyer Tan Yigong. The court then declared the debate concluded and awaited a scheduled verdict.</p>

<h3 id="e139">How to Maintain Public Order? <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>| Letter from Mr. Hu Liangcun |</p>
<p>In our Yi County, bandits have been rampant in recent years, and robberies are frequently heard. The people cannot defend themselves, and the government cannot solve the cases, resulting in an increase in banditry and widespread public unease. The root cause of the disaster lies in the fact that our community’s poor social structures lead to the people's bad financial behaviors; spending a fortune to build a house and one hundred taels of silver to buy land. Such extravagance tempts bandits to get involved. As for the local armed forces, although there is a county government police force to maintain order, in reality, it is not only equivalent to zero, but also causes us endless sighs. Last year, a portion of the police force mutinied, and after the mutiny, they were reorganized. What will the social order rely on? At this time, what methods should be used to defend ourselves? I respectfully ask you for guidance!</p>
<p>Reply: The problem of "people's self-defense" has two meanings: one is to defend oneself against bad politics and the exploitation of landlords and gentry; the other is to defend oneself against bandits. The letter is intended to defend oneself against "bandits." In fact, we must understand the causes of bandits before we can discuss the way to defend ourselves. The reason why bandits are so numerous is because: ㈠ China's rural areas have been directly and indirectly exploited by the commodity economy of capitalist imperialism. The rural areas are bankrupt day by day. For example, this year there has been a bumper harvest everywhere, but the government has borrowed a large batch of American wheat. The price of wheat in the market has suffered a sharp drop, and although farmers have harvested a lot of grain, they are still living through a famine year. Farmers cannot even sell their land. ㈡ The harsh taxes are increasing day by day. Farmers have to take out at least 50% of their annual grain harvest to pay taxes. ㈢ The exploitation of landlords and the exploitation of usury make it even more impossible for tenant farmers to survive, and ㈣ now poppies are being forced into collection everywhere. It is said that the opium tax collected in various parts of Huizhou amounts to eight or nine million a year. With such layers of exploitation, how can rural areas not go bankrupt quickly? In addition, imperialists oppress the people layer by layer and collude with Chinese warlords. They are doing evil there every day. Today there is a civil war here, and tomorrow Japanese soldiers are fighting there. The national economy is completely in a state of decline, which will naturally affect the rural areas. As a result, the decline of rural areas is becoming increasingly apparent. Furthermore, in a good way, the means of capitalist production have been widely adopted along the Yangtze River, using steam plows, mechanical irrigation, and electricity. As a result, the unemployment of laborers in rural areas is increasing day by day. A small portion has gone to the cities, and a large portion are still wandering in the villages. They are unwilling to "sit and wait for death," and there are two paths ahead: one is to join the army, and the other is to become bandits. This is a common phenomenon in China, and the situation in your area is probably the same. Therefore, unemployed farmers can wear military uniforms and become county police officers, or take off their military uniforms and become bandits. Zheng Banqiao said it well, "Bandits are also poor people!" Today, to defend ourselves against bandits, we must think of the entire rural economy of China and the entire economic and political situation of China. The following are some short-term measures: ㈠ Demand that the government eradicate harsh taxes and miscellaneous levies; ㈡ Oppose any opium seedling taxes, and the responsibility for banning opium should be borne jointly by local civilian groups, so as to ensure that the rural economy is not destroyed by opium planting; ㈢ Strictly oppose the usury and inhuman exploitation of landlords and commercial capital: ㈣ All public land in the area should be managed jointly by public groups and distributed to unemployed farmers for cultivation. The ownership should belong to the area, and the farmers should only pay 10% of the land rent to the area as funds for public services; ㈤ The county police should be completely disbanded and taught to cultivate public land. As for the responsibility for local security, it should be organized jointly by the local people to form a local security team, with each household contributing manpower. However, the power must be held by the people and not be controlled by local tyrants and evil gentry. Otherwise, it will become a disguised form of the county police team. If so, on the one hand, an economic source will be opened up for the rural areas, and on the other hand, unnecessary suffering will be eliminated. The rural economy can be maintained to a considerable extent, unemployment will be reduced, and there may also be fewer bandits. However, this is still a "treating the head when it hurts" approach. If you want to fundamentally "defend yourself," then you must fundamentally reform the current system. We will have the opportunity to talk about it again.</p>
<h3 id="e140">How to Deal With Debt Collectors? <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>| Letter from Mr. Peng Zemin |</p>
<p>I have a mother, an older sister, and a younger brother. My father died when I was four years old, and we have been living with my mother in hardship ever since. In the past, our lives, my sister's marriage, and my and my brother's schooling all depended on the inheritance of twenty-four mu of thin land. The harvest from the twenty-four mu of land is estimated to be about eighty yuan per year. The repair of the oil mill on the land and the living expenses of a family of four all depend on this annual income of eighty yuan. In these twenty years, natural and man-made disasters have constantly affected our remote inland area. The economic aggression of imperialism has affected the domestic rural economy. With an annual income of eighty yuan, no matter how frugal we are, it is not enough to support our lives! It is a pity that my mother led us, a group of young people, and had to struggle hard! At first, we asked friends and relatives to join hui (according to the local people's economic mutual assistance method, such as asking for a hui of one hundred yuan, ten friends must be invited, and it is held once every ten months, the leader of the hui has the right to get the first hui without giving hui interest) to maintain the temporary situation, but when it came time to run the hui, we could not come up with this large amount of money to make up the hui, so we had to pawn the land and engage in interest loans (interest of three points) to make up for it. In this way, we made up for the symptoms but did not cure the disease and struggled through more than ten years. Now, although I have a job, my annual income is only fifty yuan. My family has a total debt of more than three thousand seven hundred yuan. Even if we sell the land and the house at an estimated price, it will only be equivalent to one-half of the total debt. Moreover, in this inland area where the economy is extremely panicked, even the land cannot be sold, and the pawnshop is deliberately playing tricks and hesitating. On the one hand, the creditors are forcing and urging the debt, and we cannot live in peace all day long, which makes my family full of sorrow and makes my mother sick! I am really ashamed that I cannot make my mother feel at ease! Now, what I want to ask is: ㈠ The land cannot be sold, and the pawnshop deliberately refuses to buy it, hoping that when we are in extreme difficulty, we will sell it to him cheaply. This landlord's means of exploitation are really hateful! But is it possible to forcibly sell it to the pawnshop? ㈡ The creditor urges the payment of accumulated debts, and the debtor is unable to repay it, and life is almost cut off. How should the debtor deal with it? Is there any provision in the law to sympathize with the debtor's hardship and forgive him? ㈢ Can bankruptcy be declared in law?</p>
<p>Reply: Regarding the three points you asked in your letter, the first point is impossible according to the law; although there is no provision in the law for "sympathizing with the poor and forgiving them" for the second and third points, the law does not force them to repay if the debtors are indeed destitute; as for declaring bankruptcy, no one has ever done it yet. Now it seems that you have to do your best to pay off your debts with all you have (of course, the living expenses that your family should have should be reserved separately). If there is still a shortage, you can write another promissory note, otherwise you can only let the creditor sue, and the court will definitely not force you to create something out of nothing. I hope you can be patient and deal with it without worrying.</p>

<h3 id="e141">Girl Dies Suddenly, Awaiting Autopsy <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>Yang Wanfa, a native of Xuzhou, earns his living by rowing a boat in the Huangpu River. His family lives in a shed on the Taoyuanzhai mining land in Pudong. His daughter, Xiaocai, was only thirteen years old, and suddenly died yesterday. Wanfa immediately filed a complaint with the Third District Police Station, accusing his neighbor Zhang Huaide from Huai'an of severely injuring and killing her in an argument. He requested redress. The district approved the complaint and ordered the police to take the defendant to the district for questioning. According to the defendant's reply, he denied committing the crime, stating that the deceased was suffering from a disease, and the plaintiff had invited a fairy (a fortune teller) to the house to diagnose the illness. The fairy took incense ash and gave it to the deceased to swallow, causing her death. Now, the plaintiff has destroyed the fairy's home. The district chief, seeing that both sides had different words, decided that in order to determine the cause of the deceased's death, he summoned the 24th Tu land agent, Xie Along, to request the local court to appoint a prosecutor to come to the scene. The prosecutor found no injuries on the surface of the deceased's body, but Yang still insisted that she was beaten to death by the defendant and that her injuries were internal. The prosecutor then ordered the body to be taken to the court for an autopsy.</p>
<h3 id="e142">Pirates Ruthlessly Rob a Civilian Boat <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>Three Crew Members Killed and Boat Owner's Ear Cut Off</p>
<p>Yong Jihe and several other shops in this port, which handle various merchandise, sugar, groceries, seafood, and foreign goods from Changzhou and Wuxi, loaded the civilian boats Niu Yunfang, Yang Zuolin, and three other boats with goods the day before yesterday for transport. Because they urgently needed to sell the goods, they hired a small towing boat. They agreed with the towing boat to tow them to the Dianshan Lake area, and then each boat would sail on its own way. In the afternoon, after being towed to Dianshan Lake and unmoored, Niu and the other three boats sailed together, while the other two boats went their separate ways. As they sailed near the west end of the lake, before it was dark, four or five pirate boats suddenly sailed towards them, with twenty or thirty pirates on board. They suddenly opened fire, ordering them to stop. The twenty or so people on the three boats, Niu and the other three boats, were still able to resist and continued to sail straight ahead, ordering each crew member to do their best to resist, so that the pirates could not board the boat. Seeing that they did not stop, the pirates immediately raised their sails, chased after them, and opened fire. Three crew members on the three boats were killed, and five or six were injured. The boats were all shot through. Niu's boat was hit with several holes and flooded. At this point, the crew members panicked and were finally caught. The pirates boarded the boat, first asked for the boat owner, and forced him to hand over the silver dollars. All the silver dollars on the three boats were robbed, but because Niu replied that there were no dollars on the boat, he was searched and the pirates were furious. They cut off one of Niu's ears. Then, they continued to loot the goods. Suddenly, they heard the sound of a whistle, and they stopped looting. The pirates returned to their pirate boats and fled. Niu's ear was cut off, and he fainted. The incident was reported to the anti-smuggling patrol boat, which was instructed to investigate, and the boats were sailed to Tagang and docked. The boatmen sent Niu and the three crew members who had been killed by the pirates to the hospital for treatment. Although the three boats of Niu and the others were not completely robbed, the boats were all shot with holes, and Niu's boat suffered the greatest loss. The sugar loaded on the boat was flooded, and the boat could not sail. Yesterday, someone came to Shanghai to report to Yong Jihe and other shops and borrowed silver dollars to buy coffins for the three crew members who had been killed. At the same time, they hired another boat to go there and unload the goods from Niu's boat, and they sent a telegram to the goods companies in Changzhou and Wuxi.</p>

<h3 id="e144">Parents of the Second Jiaotong School Hold a Joint Meeting <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Second Jiaotong Vocational School of the Ministry of Communications was initially initiated by employees of the Postal Bureau and was later managed by the Ministry of Communications. It has been established for three years, and the number of students has reached more than 200. Although it suffered significant losses during the January 28th Incident, it was soon restored. However, the school is often affected by politics, and the principals have been changed several times, resulting in the school's affairs becoming increasingly stagnant. The parents of the school's students believe that the frequent changes of principals are likely to hinder the school's affairs and affect the children's studies, so there is an organization of the Parents' Association. The purpose is to connect the spirit between the school and the parents, hoping to achieve the effectiveness of both family education and social education, and at the same time, to supervise all school administrative affairs. Yesterday, the association held its second congress, with more than 100 parents attending. The Postal Workers' Union also sent Standing Committee members Lu Keming, Cao Chongye, Wu Tinglun, and Secretary Zhang Kejing. Chairman Meng Fanlin presided over the meeting, and the following proposals were passed: ㈠ The school shall not restrict the number of students; ㈡ Expanding the school buildings; ㈢ Increasing the annual funding; ㈣ Establishing a junior high school; ㈤ The school suffered great losses during the January 28th Incident and should seek special funds to restore it; ㈥ In the future, the school shall not be affected by politics. All of the above proposals were passed and handed over to the Board of Directors for handling. Furthermore, the school's principal, Tong Pingshan, was recently ordered to be transferred. The parents all agreed that the frequent changes of principals are greatly related to their children's education, especially since the term has already changed four times. If he is allowed to be transferred again, the future of the school will become increasingly unsustainable. Moreover, Principal Tong has been handling the school very appropriately since taking office, and although it has not been long, the school's affairs have suddenly progressed. Therefore, it was unanimously agreed to retain him and to petition the Committee on Communications and Employee Affairs to withdraw the order.</p>

<p>To the Editor,</p>
<p>Regarding the news item in your newspaper on the 15th of this month concerning the alleged rape of a goddaughter, in which Tong Azhong sued Zhu Jinde for mistreating his daughter, Tong Qiaogu, and entrusted this lawyer to represent him in court, I have investigated and found that the case was entirely due to a temporary discord between Zhu Jinde and his wife, Tong Qiaogu, leading to litigation. The allegations in the lawsuit are somewhat based on misunderstanding. The parties have now reached an understanding, and the portion of the lawsuit against Zhu Jinde has been withdrawn. As this concerns the reputation of others, I hereby provide a factual account to clarify the situation and request that it be published as a Letter to the Editor for correction.</p>

<p>(Jinan Express) The Shandong Provincial Senior High School, which caused the student unrest in Jinan, began identifying students who had repented at all levels today (the 13th).

As for the other students, except for 30 students who actively instigated the strike, who will be severely punished, 380 other students have submitted letters of repentance and guarantees and paid various fees after being notified by the school. Only 20-30 students have not submitted them. From today until the 15th, the school will identify those who have submitted letters of repentance by class. After the identification is completed, the school will reopen. The school has now scheduled to reopen on the 18th of this month.

<p>1. I bathe at least ······ times every ······.</p>
<p>Teachers can add or subtract from the contents of the five types of forms listed above according to the circumstances. This is just an example. Health education does not emphasize knowledge but habits. These five forms can be used to compare the parents' assessment, the teacher's investigation, and the children's report to determine the children's hygiene status. We can also know what the children are lacking and what they need. In this way, our health education materials will be inexhaustible. However, teachers should never be vague about things they do not know. They should consult doctors to resolve the issues. At the same time, if parents have opinions, they should also ask teachers or doctors to clarify them clearly. Do not harm the children with "probably," "almost," or "carelessly."</p>
<p>Second Step: Choosing Teaching Materials</p>
<p>The new required curriculum standards, curriculum outlines, textbooks, and teaching content can all be organized using the materials from these five types of forms to adapt. When selecting teaching materials, we should pay attention to the following five goals:</p>
<p>1. Adapt to the needs of children: For example, if children have bad teeth, they must find ways to correct them to meet the needs of children.</p>
<p>2. Enhance children's health: When children have bad teeth, teachers should teach children how to protect their teeth and prevent problems.</p>
<p>3. Teaching materials should be scientific: This can be divided into three levels:</p>
<p>(1) Purely scientific: For example, how many cups of boiled water should children drink every day? I think it's not appropriate to specify a certain number of cups. It should be based on the needs of children. Drink boiled water when thirsty, but do not force them to drink five or ten cups. This is truly scientific.</p>
<p>(2) Seemingly scientific: Some people often say that getting cholera vaccinations guarantees that you will not get cholera. Here, "guarantee" is learned, but you get sick. There are strengths and weaknesses in life and physical condition, and good and bad qualities in medicine and environment. How can you "guarantee" that you will not get cholera? Isn't this seemingly scientific but not really scientific?</p>
<p>(3) Unscientific: This is very obvious. Common in the old society, such as using talismans to treat diseases, or seeking divination to treat diseases, etc. The teacher's priority for teaching materials is to ask whether they are scientific or not. After reading the above three points, we know how to make choices more easily.</p>
<p>4. Proportionality of Teaching Material Content: The goal of health education is to cultivate children's habits, intelligence, and attitudes. Low-grade students do not need to know principles because they really don't understand. Therefore, the teaching material on intelligence should be less, and the habit should be supervised and implemented, and cannot be relaxed. Both intelligence and habit should be given equal importance for high-grade students. Now, let's set a ratio below:</p>
<p>Grade | High | Middle | Low</p>
<p>Habit | 40% | 50% | 60%</p>
<p>Intelligence | 40% | 30% | 20%</p>
<p>Attitude | 20% | 20% | 20%</p>
<p>5. Link Teaching Materials of Various Subjects: Which teacher should be in charge of the hygiene subject? Needless to say, the class teacher can take on the job happily. By entrusting this task to the class teacher, the problem of linking teaching materials of various subjects can be easily solved. Item 5 of the Implementation Measures of the Curriculum Standards stipulates: "After the promulgation of these standards, the education bureaus of each county and city should immediately organize a local teaching material collection committee to collect local teaching materials that are actually used in the township based on the operating requirements of each subject in these standards as supplementary teaching materials and submit them to the competent education administration agency for review and approval before adding them to the specific teaching material items." Then, the hygiene subject should also follow the same and do not forget to contact various subjects. For example, the geography subject discusses the nutritional problems of local products, and the natural science subject discusses local animals and plants and leads to sex education issues. There are countless examples like this, and it depends on everyone to do it well.</p>
<p>Third Step: Emphasize Activities</p>
<p>The implementation of hygiene education, especially in lower grades, depends mostly on extracurricular activities, not fixed in class. Of course, teachers should emphasize linking children to do various activities. Teachers should participate in all of the children's actions in a childlike manner. That is, when children go to the toilet, use towels to wipe their eyes, and wipe their noses, etc., teachers must pay attention at any time. The scope of training is very large. All roadsides, sports fields, and test sites are good places for teachers to engage in hygiene activities. The issues of training include: (1) design, (2) demonstration, (3) appreciation, (4) contact, (5) testing, and (6) practice. These teachers should always guide.</p>
<p>Fourth Step: Check Progress</p>
<p>Investigating the progress of children's hygiene habits and attitudes is an indispensable step in hygiene teaching. Rapid and clear progress indicates good teaching. Otherwise, improvements must be made immediately. The progress situation is clear when using these five forms to compare. The tables filled out by the children themselves can give them good stimulation, just like forgetting to brush their teeth. When filling out the form, they will have the reaction of brushing their teeth. Things like this can help children directly.</p>
<p>Special Teaching Methods for Elementary Schools</p>
<p>With the above four steps, the health education problem can be said to be completely solved. Now let's add some special teaching methods for elementary school health education.</p>
<p>(1) Morning Inspection: Everyone should already know this method. This is not a special matter, nor is it a morning meeting. It is one to investigate children's hygiene and implement habits; two to investigate children's cleanliness; three to investigate acute diseases; four to train children to practice self-examination.</p>
<p>(2) Measuring Weight: There is no standard for human weight. The so-called standard is fabricated and unscientific. The purpose of our measuring weight is to see how much the children's body weight has increased, such as one to see the children's progress in development; two to let children understand their own weight progress and arouse interest in health; three if weight does not progress and diseases are discovered, treat them as soon as possible.</p>
<p>(3) Hygiene Self-Government: Many elementary schools have established children's self-government associations. It is a very good thing for children to do their own management. Hygiene education is often completely responsible for teachers and doctors, and children are sitting by and watching. This is wrong. If it is handed over to the children to manage themselves, the efficiency of progress will definitely be easier to see. From now on, we can promote it.</p>

<p>Clarifying Weak Basketball Skills</p>
<p>The Chengqing team in Group 4 of Division B this time has skilled basketball skills and strong fighting power. However, most of the players are from the Business Department of Hujiang University and also work in the banking industry. Due to busy work at the end of the year, they cannot field their full team, so the results are average. The entire main force of the team was free to play the entire game the night before last, and they defeated the Xiping team, the champion of Group B4, by a score of 49 to 21. From this, it can be seen that the team's strength is indeed the champion of Group B4. Unfortunately, the players' official duties are difficult to manage, and they cannot field their full team, only maintaining their spirit of not giving up, resulting in the loss of the championship. As for the Xiping team, although it is the champion of Group B4, the record is six wins and one loss in seven games, with a percentage of 0.857 (the basketball association's secretary mistakenly calculated seven wins and seven wins, resulting in a score of 1,000 points). We are urgently making corrections.</p>

<p>Hongdui is Donghua Association</p>
<p>The Hongdui team in Group 1 of Division B of the Shanghai Basketball Association is organized by the Donghua Football Association. All basketball players are also football players. The purpose is to adjust their interests. The Donghua Association originally intended to participate in both the A and B basketball teams. The Hujiang University team represented Group A. Later, the Hujiang players had to represent the school, so Donghua gave up the idea.</p>

<h3 id="e176">The Relativity of Snow <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>— Zhan Lu</p>
<p>Snow is full of egalitarian ideas. Looking at the rugged and narrow paths on the mountains, the high and low stone steps are all filled in by it, showing that what it hates most is classism.</p>
<p>Snow is most full of classism, especially distinguishing between the poor and the rich with cold and warmth. It only invades thatched cottages, adding snow to frost for the poor. It does not invade the homes of the wealthy with heavy curtains. Even if it does occasionally invade, it is baked by the electric stove, and it blends in with the warm air in the greenhouse and assimilates.</p>
<p>Snow is pure and flawless. In any competition of pure substances, no one can compete with it. In the end, it always wins the championship in the competition of the pure world.</p>
<p>Snow is capable of hiding dirt and filth. It only adorns the turbid world with a deceiving temporary mask. In fact, it is very dirty. Any filthy thing is under its all-encompassing nature. In the end, it also becomes a filthy thing by following the crowd.</p>
<p>Snow is full of creativity. With just one night's work, the exquisite pavilions and jade buildings that are not easily seen in the human world are all created by it alone. It certainly has creative genius.</p>
<p>Snow is full of imitation. Xie Huilian's "Snow Rhapsody" says, "It becomes a gui (jade tablet) because of the square, and a bi (jade disc) because of the circle." How can it have creative genius? It only inherits and imitates.</p>
<p>Snow has a connection with literary people. Whether new or old literary people, they have a special feeling for it. It also fully provides literary people with convenience in their works.</p>
<p>Snow has a connection with military people. Marching in the snow is a common strategy in war. Li Su's surprise attack on Caizhou on a snowy night is a definite proof that military people have a special feeling for it. It also gives military people rare opportunities for marching.</p>

<p>— Xu Baishi</p>
<p>｜Also a Snapshot｜</p>
<p>Friends, the ones walking happily on the road, carrying a messy little box, a three-legged stool used by shoemakers, and a wooden frame nailed with white cloth, these are artists.</p>
<p>They have a head of messy hair that they intentionally mess up; they may have money, but they intentionally wear such broken and dirty clothes to run outside.</p>
<p>What is this for? It is to be an artist. They usually carry a paint box when they go out, indicating that they are painters. They often go out without wearing socks, the reason being, women can go without wearing socks, why can't men? Besides, I am an artist······.</p>
<p>They don't have to go to school, and they can get up at ten o'clock every day: they often work overtime at night, and what they are working on is writing love letters.</p>
<p>They randomly paint red and green colors on the canvas, as if the canvas is a palette; when people ask them, they say, this is my creation. Moreover, their creative power is very strong. They can produce at least a dozen such paintings every day.</p>
<p>Their lives are very artistic: some wear suits without ties; some wear coats on top and shorts on the bottom; brand-new white leather shoes must be dusted with some gray color before putting them on their feet, and dirty socks are turned over and worn for a few more days; they also put some small patterns on their painting clothes, or draw a kitten or a puppy; or a skull, expressing that they are lamenting youth.</p>
<p>This is the modern artist! The current Chinese artist! Alas, this is what we can see!</p>
<h3 id="e178">Peep Show <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>— Chang Huan</p>
<p>｜Let's Expose One First｜</p>
<p>"The peep show is really fun. For one copper, you can see it three times, just hoping it won't be exposed for a while." What is a peep show? Everything in the world can be said to be a peep show. Because the peep show is all fake, once it is exposed, it is worthless. So I say that everything in the world can be called a peep show, which means that everything in the world is false and deceptive. Readers don't believe it? Please see the examples I give below:</p>
<p>Celibacy</p>
<p>A: "The opposite sex is a poisonous snake and will hinder the progress of my career. Therefore, I will never knowingly commit the crime and embrace celibacy."</p>
<p>B: "Mr. A, didn't you sincerely ask me yesterday to introduce you to someone of the opposite sex? How can you say this again now? That really makes me puzzled."</p>
<p>C: "Mr. B, why do you have to be so serious? | Eating, drinking, and sex, the great desires of man exist therein | Originally, no one in this world is willing to embrace celibacy, right? But because he hasn't found a lover yet, he says this in front of everyone!"</p>
<p>A laughs······ strangely······</p>

<h3 id="e179">Japan's Bitch <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>— Holding a Buddha</p>
<p>｜Many Varieties｜</p>
<p>Prostitution has a long history. Guan Zhong established three hundred female brothels to facilitate merchants. Isn't this the alley of today's brothels? The Analects say: "The people of Qi presented female musicians." Emperor Wu of Han established military brothels for soldiers who did not have wives. By the Song Dynasty, the system of military brothels still existed. Su Dongpo wrote: "Zhou Shao, registered in the military of Hangzhou, collected many rare teas and often competed with Junmo [the style name of Cai Xiang] to win. He also knew how to write poetry. Zirong passed through Hangzhou and treated him to a meal. Shao requested to be removed from the register, and holding a pen, he composed a poem: 'The nest on the ridge is empty, years pass in alarm, I can't bear to look back and dress my feathers; if the snow-clad bird is released from the cage, I will always chant the Prajna Sutra of Avalokitesvara.' Shao was dressed in white at the time, and everyone sighed in admiration." Not only that, but during the Eastern Han Dynasty, Ma Rong set up a crimson curtain. He was a master of classical studies. He lectured students in front and had female musicians behind. From this, it can be said that in ancient times, prostitutes had close relationships with the military, scholars, merchants, and various other circles. Not only in China, but in every country in the East and West, there are prostitutes. Taking Japan as an example, there are many types, so let's briefly list a few.</p>
<p>There are many names for prostitutes. Why are they called "bitches"? A "biao" (婊) refers to a woman outside of the home, meaning she is not the formal wife. Why are they called "changfu" (倡婦)? "Chang" (倡) is interchangeable with "chang" (唱), meaning the female musicians of ancient times. Why are they called "jinu" (妓女)? "Ji" (妓) means skill, like the Japanese "geisha" (藝者) and "maiko" (舞子). There are many names for prostitutes in our country, such as public prostitutes, private prostitutes, "changsan" (長三), "yaoer" (么二), "tangpai" (淌牌), and "yeji" (野雞). It's the same in Japan.</p>
<p>The highest-class prostitutes in Japan are called "geisha" (藝者), like the "qingguanren" (清倌人) of our country in the past. Li Shishi of the Song Dynasty, Dong Xiaowan, Li Xiangjun, Liu Rushi, and Chen Yuanyuan of the Ming Dynasty may be somewhat similar. If you really want to be enchanted, it will cost thousands of yuan, and sometimes it may not even be possible. In Tokyo, places like Nihonbashi, Shinbashi, Yamatashita, Kudanzaka, and Kagurazaka are all their love nests. Their residences are luxurious, and their clothing and decorations are extremely extravagant. Once, a geisha lost a diamond ring worth 18,000 yuan. From this, we can see their extravagance.</p>
<p>Japanese prostitutes are also divided into public and private. Let's talk about the private ones later. The places where the public ones live are called "shōro" (娼樓), like the "qinglou" (青樓), "jiaofang" (教坊), "yaozi" (窰子), and "changmen" (倡門) that we say in our country. The madam is called "tekishō" (敵娼), and also "aite" (相手). The pimp is also called "aite" (相手). The fee for entertainment is called "sekiryō" (席料), and also "yu dai" (湯代). As for the cost, it is calculated by time, about 1.5 to 6 yuan per hour, which is very similar to the tuition fee of a middle school teacher.</p>
<p>There are also "shakufu" (酌婦), like the female waiters in our country, but in Japan, they are hired by restaurants to serve wine to guests. There are also "maiko" (舞子), who are mostly teenage girls, like the dancers in our country's ×× dance troupe and the female performers selling medicine in the streets. They are somewhat different from the dancers in dance halls.</p>

<h3 id="e180">Guilty Conscience <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>— By A Thin Red Shrike</p>
<p>After finishing his meals, he had nothing to do every day, so he would chat and joke with the couple at will, without being constrained or polite. When he was happy, he would help them with some trivial household chores, feeding the goldfish, watering the flowers, or keeping track of petty cash; tidying up the furnishings; or else he would go to the bookshelf to find his good companions. Sometimes, when Xiaoman saw that he was too idle and worried that he would get sick from boredom, she would say to him, "You're really lazy; after eating, you don't want to do anything. The parrot on the shelf is almost starving to death. If you continue to be so lazy, I'll send you to herd cows tomorrow. Hey! Be careful..." Or at other times, when he occasionally had a sentimental feeling that stirred up old wounds in his heart, as long as his brow furrowed slightly, as soon as Dongfang Sheng saw it, he would immediately say in a teasing manner, "Haha! What season is it today? This kid's old illness has flared up again. Xiaoman, come, I'll play the zither, you sing a short song, let's all help this kid cure his illness..." In this way, his sorrow and depression were immediately driven away to the land of nowhere by that burst of laughter and the beautiful sound of the zither and songs.</p>
<p>Living such a simple life, ordinary but not monotonous, quiet but not lonely, after only three or four months, he felt as if the world he was in had changed: his body also seemed to have changed, the scars in his heart gradually healed; the courage in life that had been lost gradually revived, until the radiance of his appearance gradually became full. Except for occasionally thinking of his stepmother and his previous circumstances, everything felt happy.</p>
<p>However, in this light and meaningful atmosphere of happiness, there was one thing that often made him feel unhappy. He felt that he had not given Dongfang Sheng any special favors in the past, and it would be difficult to expect appropriate rewards in the future. Could he continue to disturb them like this, and they would never get tired of him? Even if they never got tired of him, his own conscience would not be able to handle it. Once this thought arose, he often couldn't help but say to Dongfang Sheng with embarrassment and uneasiness, "I... I can't possibly be here forever..."</p>
<p>Whenever this happened, before he could finish speaking, Dongfang Sheng would always smile indifferently, as if he had already seen through his thoughts, and immediately stop him from saying, "Little thing, don't say it. Whatever you say, I am willing to listen, but I am not willing to hear the one sentence that you are hiding in your throat right now." Such words were no different from closing the door and bolting it, so he had no choice but to stop in embarrassment. The innocent Xiaoman was especially clever, and whenever he expressed that he felt sorry, she would say with a smile, "We used to dislike our environment very much, feeling it was too dull, so the two of us very much hoped that a child would jump out and liven things up. Unfortunately, we waited for a long time, and finally we were disappointed, which was so unfortunate! Now that you have come, you have added a lot of fun to our boring family. You might as well consider yourself filling the void of that child, wouldn't that be good?" (8)</p>
<h3 id="e181">Shanghai Night Talk <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Ruochun</p>
<p>(1) Avenue Joffre</p>
<p>Avenue Joffre is the most South European-flavored street in the French Concession of Shanghai. It is like a colorful snake, winding from Shanshan Bridge to Route Hoge. Trees are planted on both sides, and in spring, summer, and autumn, the green leaves provide shade, and a verdant color makes people feel a kind of pleasant and comfortable impression.</p>
<p>At dusk, on the smooth sidewalks from Rue de Lu-ban to Avenue Albert, groups of young men and women: black eyes, yellow hair, high noses, red lips, some are fallen White Russian aristocrats, some are retired Khitan politicians, and some are Shanghai modern girls, wandering and strolling, browsing the enchanting window displays of the shops. Lovers, pairs of them, come out of the movie theaters, hand in hand, and go into the cafes. There are also single men, strolling towards the quiet residential areas, looking up at the neat Western-style houses along the road in the hazy night, the colored lights shining through the thin gauze curtains, revealing a corner of the red building. What a poetic and interesting scene this is.</p>
<p>On both sides of Avenue Joffre, there are more White Russian men and women living than French people. Within the French Concession, there are more than 10,000 people who speak Russian, and less than 2,000 who speak French. But these one thousand or so French residents rule over more than 500,000 Chinese people. The lives of the French residents should naturally be excellent and noble.</p>
<p>The White Russian expatriates on Avenue Joffre like to call it Nikolaevskaya ulitsa among themselves. The Jiangbei people who pull rickshaws call it Baochang Road. A small number of Chinese people who like to live the Shanghai nightlife call it "Mystery Street" after the January 28th Incident. The citizens of the French Republic still call it Avenue Joffre.</p>
<p>Every year on July 14th, the French National Day, those who come out to carry lanterns and watch the festivities on Avenue Joffre are almost entirely Chinese. The high-ranking merchants of French foreign firms all hide in the French Club on Rue Mère de Dieu, drinking and reveling all night long. The French soldiers all gather in their own barracks or in the dance hall on Rue Paul Henry to enjoy themselves to the fullest.</p>
<p>More than a decade ago, when welcoming Marshal Joffre to Shanghai, the French Concession was deserted, and everyone competed to "watch Joffre on Avenue Joffre," which was entirely Chinese people supporting the French.</p>
<p>The first magnificent cinema in Shanghai, the Cathay Theatre with its modern architecture, was built on Avenue Joffre. The coolest garden cafe and rooftop cafe are also located on Avenue Joffre. (Unfortunately, this year, "Renaissance" and "Taiga Chinguk" have both closed down one after another.) The most mysterious and exotic midnight dance halls: "Black Eyes" and "New Hawaii" are also on Avenue Joffre. The mysterious dens of massage parlors that used to be lined up in the area of North Sichuan Road and Bazilu, which often aroused the curiosity of the general public, have also moved to Avenue Joffre.</p>
<p>Avenue Joffre is a street full of exotic flavors, the Nikolaevskaya ulitsa of the East, and also the emerging Mystery Street.</p>
<h3 id="e182">The Land of Gentlemen <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>— Menglan</p>
<p>Those with blue eyes and yellow beards call our honorable compatriots "sick men of East Asia."</p>
<p>In fact, this is wrong, no wonder it has aroused strong opposition from our great men and gentlemen, because, not to mention anything else, that term is enough to cause disgust in our great men and gentlemen, although our great men and gentlemen are mostly people who bend over and bow their backs, but you should know that what our great men and gentlemen are most afraid to point out is their weaknesses.</p>
<p>So, in my humble opinion, it should be changed to "Land of Gentlemen," that way, the term is so pleasant to the ear; when the name is correct, the words will be smooth, [although bandit uncles will also "steal the beauty," saying something about "gentlemen on the roof beam," but that is harmless,] even the village schoolteacher in the small village will deeply agree with what I say, saying, "Those who obey me prosper, those who oppose me perish, with this dignified drum and this upright flag, what cannot be overcome!" As for the content, there is no need to delve into it. Our great men and gentlemen only need a pleasant-sounding term. As for whether they are hypocritical gentlemen, true gentlemen, or opium addicts? Blowing wrinkles on a pool of spring water, what does it matter to you?</p>

<p>Shorts' Swap Spreads Widen Significantly</p>
<p>March Gold Marking Anticipated to Tighten</p>
<p>Shorts Anxious to Cover, Few Longs Available</p>
<p>Spread Widens from Five Cents to 2.5 Taels</p>
<p>Final Stand Between 2.2 and 2.3 Cents</p>
<p>(Market Situation Before and After Swap) Yesterday's gold marking market saw a slight drop in London prices by 0.0625 according to foreign telegrams, yet opened lower. This was due to Bank of America offering long positions at 1.25, and forward silver prices also seeing a slight increase of several cents. Additionally, due to shorts offering swap spreads, the March upturn was expected. Consequently, the March contract opened at 798.5 taels, and the February contract at 799.7 taels, a difference of 1.2 taels, signifying swap listing. Subsequently, shorts were eager to cover, while longs had largely disappeared, pushing the spread higher. The marking price also rose accordingly to 799.5 taels, and the February contract to 800.007 taels. HSBC's listings both rose by 1.25, and the foreign exchange market saw a slight hardening. Coupled with news favorable to the silver market, gold prices gradually fell. Although the Central Bank's spot offerings caused a rebound, prices soon fell again to 793.6 taels, as the bank offered lower half-month US dollars at 1.25 for January and 3.125 for April, with little demand. In the afternoon, the market first rose due to HSBC taking March US dollars at 0.25, and then further to 97 taels as the bank sought to close out contracts for the current month at 28 yuan and May at 3.125, followed by another spot offering from the Central Bank that got up to 8.6 taels. Later, with the foreign exchange market remaining flat, the market closed at 797.3 taels. Initial swap trades saw longs offering seven cents, then five cents, before rising to as high as 2.5 taels, before settling in the 2.2-2.3 tael range. Apart from the Central Bank and some spot dealers holding some positions, few longs were to be seen. The market situation before and after is recorded below.</p>
<p>(Morning Market Tracking the Spread's Fluctuations) The morning opened low, with the March opening at 798.5 taels. Yuankangxiang and Wupin offered terms (Wupin opened at 797.5 taels), gradually dropping to 6.5 taels, as attention focused on the swap market. When the long Hengxing completed its swap, the shorts aggressively increased the spread, and Dadecheng and Hengyu then came to purchase terms, rising to over 8 taels. The bank also opened at this point, with a recent offer of one shilling and eight pence for British exchange and 28 yuan for US dollars, slightly firmer by 0.0625. The bank's private telegram also slightly increased by 0.0625. Dadecheng continued to advance, reaching 9.5 taels. Fushun repeatedly offered, reaching 7.5 taels. As the foreign exchange market slightly hardened, March US dollars at 1.875 could not be sold. Daxing, Yongyuanchun, Yuanmao, Yongdeng, and others offered, retreating to 5.4 taels. Bingxing, Yuanmao, and Yongdeng sold slightly at this point, while Hengyu advanced, improving to 7 taels. HSBC's listings were announced, with British and American exchange both rising by 1.25, slightly declining to 6.5 taels. Yuanheng entered, and prices hovered upwards, with Hengxing also purchasing, reaching 8.5 taels, while Yongfeng offered, dropping to 7.2 taels. During this period, Yuanmao, Yongfuyu sold, while Hengxing and Hengyu advanced. Huabi and Mitsui both took April US dollars at 0.25, rising again to 8.4 taels, fluctuating slightly, but the foreign exchange market changed rapidly. April US dollars at 0.25 suddenly could not be sold, and Hengyu then came to unload, dropping to within 6 taels. Yifeng and Yong also offered, while Qingfa and Yong advanced, holding at 5.5 taels. Hengxing, acting on behalf of the Central Bank, offered at 6.4 taels. Although it continued to offer multiple times after that, the price did not rise, as April US dollars were already trading at 2.125. Zhifengyong also purchased terms at this point, reportedly acting on behalf of Dafeng Heng, resulting in fluctuations around 6 taels. Although April US dollars at 3.125 were also difficult to sell, Yuanchun, Yuankangxiang, and Daxingyong competed to sell, resulting in 3.7 taels, then rising to 4 cents. Finally, the price fell to 93.6 taels due to the Central Bank selling lower half-month US dollars for January at 1.25, closing at this price shortly thereafter. After the close, it was heard that the foreign exchange market saw better transactions, and Yuanheng immediately came to purchase aggressively, reaching 4.5 taels or so, while Wupin had already closed at 3.5 taels.</p>
<p>(Final Result: Down 3.7 Taels) The afternoon market inherited the momentum from the afternoon, opening with a jump of 1.1 taels, at 794.7 taels. Retail investors sold, dropping to 4.1 taels. HSBC took March US dollars at 0.25, rising to 5 taels. Fuyu purchased slightly, reaching 5.2-3 taels. Hongli also advanced to over 6 taels. Dadecheng waited to sell at a limit price of 6.2 taels, resulting in slight fluctuations. However, Fuyu's buying intention was extremely strong, rising to 6.7 taels. Zhifengyong also came to compete for purchases, jumping to 7.2 taels. Yifeng sold, resulting in a slight drop to 6.1 taels. After that, the situation gradually improved, with the bank wanting January US dollars at 28 yuan and May at 3.125. Yongfeng advanced to 7.5 taels. Mitsui took April at 3.125. Yifengyong and Dadecheng advanced to 8 taels. Zhaofengchang purchased terms, reaching 8.6 taels, fluctuating slightly, as retail investors and Wupin sold slightly, then returned to 7.5 taels. Qianchangxiang advanced to over 8 taels. Hengxing, acting on behalf of the Central Bank, advanced, and Dadecheng also purchased, reaching 8.4 taels. After that, although Dadecheng wanted to purchase within 8 taels at a limit price, the foreign exchange market's inability to sell April US dollars at 0.25 led to a downstream trend, hovering around 7.5 taels for a long time. Banks made deals on March 1.875, with other firms wanting to sell but lacking buyers, and prices continued to decline. Hengyu came to sell, resulting in around 6 taels. Daxingyong and Qingfayong then dumped, hovering before seeing 97.8 taels again. At this time, it was close to the close, and little buying or selling was seen. Finally, the market closed at 797.3 taels. Wupin, with aggressive buying, closed at 798.5 taels (double-revealed price). The highest price of the day was 799.5 taels, and the lowest price was 793.6 taels, with a fluctuation of 5.9 taels. As a result, yesterday was down 3.7 taels from the previous weekend.</p>
<p>(Revealed Price Approximately Suppressed by 67 Taels) The revealed price was 864.86 taels due to HSBC's listing of US dollars rising by 1.25 to 27.75 yuan. Based on the closing price, it was approximately 67 taels outside the button. The difference from the previous weekend was minimal. The registered accounts were 796 taels for January and February, and 794 taels for March. Replenishment water was 795 taels in the morning and 798 taels in the afternoon.</p>
<p>(Central Bank Still Offering Spot) Yesterday, a total of about six months' worth of terms were entered, largely done by spot dealers such as Hengxing and Dafeng Heng, with prices from 6 to 7 taels, and 8 taels in the afternoon. Among them, Hengxing's positions were the most.</p>
<p>(On-Market Trading Improved) In summary, Hengxing, Wanxing, Zhifengyong, Bingxing, Yuanheng, Fuchang, Qingfayong, Zhaofengchang, Qianchangxiang, and others were all buyers. Daxingyong, Yongfeng, Yuankangxiang, Yuanmaoyong, Yifengyong, Hengyu, and Fushun were all sellers. Dadecheng, Fuyu, Yuanchun, Hongli, Yifeng, Shunli, and others were first sellers and then buyers. Dalian gang Wanxing advanced over 200 terms in the morning, while Shunli advanced only ten terms. Guang gang Hengxing advanced over 400 terms in the morning, selling a few, and then advanced slightly over 100 in the afternoon. Yifeng's advances and sales were minimal in the morning, and slightly more sales in the afternoon. Wupin's hedging was also a seller.</p>
<p>(Smelting Market Appears More Stagnant) With the Spring Festival approaching, the smelters seemed to have little interest, and the Hakka gang was also stagnant. Although the market saw an increase of 9.5 taels yesterday, it was slightly better than the previous Saturday, due to the swap. Transactions totaled approximately 100 taels. Dafeng Heng sold and then increased to 9.75 taels, which was received by Yingfenghang and others. The silver shop gang sold, with transactions of approximately 200 taels.</p>
<p>(Realistic Account of the Swap) Yesterday morning, before 8 o'clock, dealers had already started the swap. First, shorts offered seven cents, Dadecheng offered, approximately 490 terms, which were taken in by Dalian gang Wanxing and Hengxing. Continuing at five cents, Yifeng then came to swap out long positions, approximately 280 terms. Later, Hengxing swapped out many positions at seven cents, and many shorts were willing to swap, rising to about one tael, still taken in by Hengxing, with Daliancheng and Wupin offering. By this time, the market had opened, and Hengxing had temporarily retreated. Shorts made a strong effort to offer, opening at 1.2 taels, then increasing to 1.7-8 taels, which was taken in by Daxingyong. Hengxing continued to swap out long positions, resulting in mutual price declines to about one tael. After that, longs were scarce. Bingxing came to offer, returning to 1.3 taels, which was taken in by Hengyu. Dadecheng offered Yingfenghang a total of 1.4 taels, Ruikang offered Zhifengyong 1.2 taels, but the numbers were not large. After that, the volume increased, with Wanxing offering Yuanmaoyong 35 terms, reaching 2 taels. Zhaofengchang (acting on behalf of Fuchang) took in 2.3 taels, offered by Qingfayong. Yuanmaoyong then took in 2.5 taels, traded against retail investors. In the afternoon, Hengxing suddenly looked for longs everywhere, offering 2 taels. Bingxing offered Tongfenghang and others 105 terms, at 2.2 taels. It was heard that there was news of spot goods being intercepted en route, coupled with the fact that only spot dealers remained on the long side, and the Central Bank remained inactive, leading to higher spreads. As of the previous Saturday, January's terms totaled 147 terms, and January's total was 17,493 terms.</p>
<h3 id="e184">Foreign Exchange Market Loosens Both Openly and Covertly <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign exchange market loosened due to London telegrams showing a contraction of 0.0625, with British-American exchange slightly rising by 1.25, while American-British exchange remained unchanged. The opening price for the near term was one shilling and eight pence, due to the downward trend in gold marking prices, on par with yesterday's closing price. American silver added 1.25, and forward silver prices also rose by several cents. Private telegrams also increased by 0.0625. As a result, the opening price for American exchange was slightly firmer, with the near term at 28 yuan. HSBC's listings both added 1.25, gradually entering a loosening trend. Financial firms such as Hengxing slightly plugged American dollars to hedge terms. Large firms also dumped positions. HSBC scooped up about 30,000 pounds of shillings. Huabi scooped up British-American exchange. Eastern firms advanced more than they sold. In addition, McCallum and Citibank both scooped up positions. HSBC's listings both increased by 1.25, and there was a trend of previous shorts in the Bombay silver market flipping to long positions, leading to bullish sentiment on telegrams. The foreign exchange market loosened slightly, but the banks' appetite remained good. The afternoon was first tight, then flat, with few transactions. As a result, British exchange was flat, while American exchange rose slightly by about 1.25. The day's range was about 1.25. British-American exchange traded at 3.36875 yuan for April. Meifeng advanced shillings and sold American dollars, trading against Holland. The banks' advances and sales prices are listed below.</p>
<p>(British Exchange) Although gold prices fell in the morning, telegrams contracted, so the opening price for British exchange was level with the previous close, with the near term offering one shilling and eight pence. Anda first sold April at 1.25. Mitsui scooped up and HSBC also settled January at 0.0625, and then advanced the same month at the same price. These were plugged by Huabi and McCallum. Sassoon sold Huabi May at 1.25. Meifeng took Holland's offering of April at 1.25 (hedging British-American exchange). In the afternoon, HSBC continued to absorb January at 0.0625, with Huabi selling. The closing price for January was one shilling and eight pence, with February advancing at 0.0625, March at 0.0625, and April advancing at 1.25, tighter by 0.0625 than the afternoon close, but flat compared to the previous close.</p>
<p>(American Exchange) Due to the rise in silver prices and the fall in gold prices, the near term opened 0.0625 firmer than the previous close, at 28 yuan. Huabi sold Zhengjin January at 28 yuan. Holland took March at 1.875. Sassoon sold Huabi February at 1.25. Huabi also scooped up April at 3.125. McCallum scooped up April at 2.5. Mitsui and Zhengjin traded January at 0.0625.

Afternoon trading declined. Citibank first took May at 3.75. Mitsui also scooped up April at 3.125. Zhongfu sold and Huabi took March at 1.875. Citibank advanced and Shanghai plugged February at only 0.0625. The closing offer for January was 28 yuan, 0.0625, February 1.25, March 1.875, and April 2.5, with advance prices adding 0.0625. One American dollar equaled three taels, six cents, zero li, and six hao of silver.</p>

<h3 id="e186">Banks and Money Shops Exceptionally Busy on Closing Day <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>｜Twofold Business···Closing and Rectifying｜</p>
<p>In recent days, various Chinese financial industries, due to the abolition of the old calendar year-end, have mostly announced their total closure, and the procedures have been more troublesome than usual. The banks were generally closed on Sunday the day before yesterday, and there was no way to collect and resolve accounts. Yesterday, it was necessary to carry out large-scale rectification. Therefore, although the business scene seemed bleak, the rectification situation was indeed vast. Just the settlement of accounts alone was extremely busy. In the money shops, especially, large loans urgently needed to be collected. The busyness of the situation could not be described in words.</p>
<h3 id="e187">Foreign Cents Slightly Lower, Silver Discount Remains the Same <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>"Silver Cents" Yesterday, the foreign cent market price was quite good for bank purchases, but prices were weak, because the sources were plentiful, and the current cash on the market was abundant. The morning and afternoon markets were both at seven cents, one fen, three li, and two hao and a half. As a result, the afternoon market was only one hao and two hu and a half lower than the previous day's afternoon market. Judging from the general trend, there is a possibility of falling but no possibility of rising at present. The "silver discount" opened at two fen in both the morning and afternoon markets. Due to the wide availability of cash, Liu Tou crossed it out all day long.</p>
<h3 id="e188">Copper Dollars Rebound After Slight Drop in Small Silver Coins <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>Jiangnan small silver coins have been lagging behind in recent days, and the market was slightly sluggish yesterday. The morning market was six cents, three fen, four li, and the afternoon market was six cents, three fen, three li. As a result, although the day's market conditions were still three li better than the previous day's afternoon market, the current market situation already felt one li less. One transaction was for 6,500 jiao in the morning market and 3,500 jiao in the afternoon market. Guangdong small silver coins generally trended lower, with the morning market at six cents, two fen, two li and a half, and the afternoon market at six cents, two fen, two li. As a result, the morning and afternoon markets were a total of one li and two hao and a half less than the previous day's morning and afternoon markets. Transactions were made for 115,000 jiao in the morning market and 40,000 jiao in the afternoon market. Copper coins, which have been shrinking sharply in recent days, continued to rise by 1,500 after rebounding by 3,000 the day before yesterday, to 376,500. Transactions were for more than 34,200 strings of cash.</p>

<p>"Silver Funds": Bank clearances seemed busier than usual at the start of the week, and exceptionally busy as the old lunar year's end approached. Chinese merchant clearances totaled 3.67 million to 3.7 million, foreign merchant clearances totaled 3.34 million to 3.4 million, telegraphic transfers exceeded 1.4 million, advances reached 2.56 million, special fund clearances surpassed 5 million, mortgage settlements and new issues totaled 1.7 million, fixed-term clearances were slightly over 5 million, various goods, exchange, taxes, and miscellaneous clearances totaled 9.89 million, warehouse entries were 500,000, warehouse exits were 1.2 million, clearances by native banks and silver firms exceeded 35 million, "quota" clearances exceeded 4.4 million, remittance clearances from various routes exceeded 700,000, cash receipts exceeded 500,000, and settlement funds exceeded 1 million.</p>
<h3 id="e190">Steady Stream of Arrivals; Foreign Exchange Transactions Are Brisk <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>"Foreign Funds": The foreign exchange market was better than usual. Banks were also buying. Exchange and remittance transfers in the early market amounted to 600,050, and in the afternoon market, 1.03 million. Banknotes were 70,000 in the morning and 40,000 in the afternoon. Off-market banknotes were 135,000 in the morning and 75,000 in the afternoon. Bank check transactions were 60,000 in the morning and 65,000 in the afternoon.

<h3 id="e191">Securities: 19 Series Good Fell by a Yuan Several Jiao <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>Other small declines ranged from a few jiao to eight or nine jiao.</p>
<p>Yesterday's (16th) trading situation at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange: Only customs duties were traded in the spot market, opening at 4,000 yuan in the morning; all other securities saw no transactions. The futures market also remained quite sluggish. Market sentiment among buyers and sellers remained quite quiet throughout. The morning session saw approximately 2.8 million in trades, and the afternoon session approximately 2.5 million, for a total of 5.3 million yuan. Of this, salt taxes accounted for over 900,000, and both the consolidated tax and 20 Series customs duties accounted for over 800,000. The rest were mostly around 500,000 to 600,000 yuan. 96 Series customs duties and the like only saw a few tens of thousands of yuan in transactions. As for changes in the prices of various bonds, although the trend continued to be peaceful and there were no major changes between the morning and afternoon sessions, the overall environment made optimism difficult, the situation was unusually chaotic, and with the Lunar New Year approaching and settlement dates drawing near, investors remained cautious and on the sidelines. Buying sentiment was particularly weak, while scattered selling was still not uncommon. Therefore, various prices hovered gradually lower than before. As a result, compared to last week, the 19 Series Good fell by a yuan several jiao, and both the 20 Series and salt taxes also fell by eight or nine jiao each. Other bonds each fell by about half a yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e192">New York Stock Market Sluggish <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>A report from the New F丰 Foreign Firm: Last Saturday (14th), the New York stock market was unusually sluggish. The market situation improved slightly due to a good earnings report from the Reynolds Tobacco Company. In the week from January 1st to 7th, the total number of railroad freight cars was 435,652, an increase of 28,873 compared to the previous week, but a decrease of 136,026 compared to the same period last year. The half-day trading volume was 361,000 shares. This recent stock market rise is still largely based on hope and psychological factors. With the start of a new year, people generally hope that industry and commerce can gradually recover, and they especially hope that the next administration can promote this recovery. Other factors, such as rumors that the government will improve the railroad situation and provide relief to rural areas, have also temporarily excited the stock market. However, observing the current situation, it seems to be showing signs of exhaustion. The Dow Jones indices for the 14th are listed below:</p>
<p>Closing Price Compared to Previous Day</p>
<p>30 Industrial Stocks 63.09 Down 0.09</p>
<p>20 Railroad Stocks 28.47 Down 0.39</p>
<p>20 Utility Stocks 28.65 Down 0.05</p>

<p>Busy Year-End, Slack Trading, Short Positions Appear</p>
<p>The yarn market is extremely lackluster, with no signs of recovery. As the abolished lunar year-end approaches, various parties are busy settling accounts, and the scope of business is shrinking, resulting in very quiet trading and minimal fluctuations. Short positions occasionally appear, but some are optimistic about overseas cotton yarn being more stable and are considering higher prices for goods in distant months next year. The war clouds looming over the Northeast have significantly impacted the financial situation.</p>
<p>(Thin Upward and Downward Momentum in the Human Standard) The human standard (Ren Biao) market opened with American cotton being flat and weak, and gold prices trending lower, leading to weaker sentiment. Prices for all months fell by one, two, or four qian. In the afternoon, although actual demand was sluggish, Chang Feng Hao purchased 1,300 bales, tightening market sentiment, and prices for all months rose by one, two, or four qian. The total trading volume for the day was 9,900 bales. Sales included 850 bales from Sen Kang, 350 bales from Shen Ji, 650 bales from Yuan Da, and 500 bales from Chun Ji. Purchases included 1,350 bales from Chang Feng, 650 bales from Xin Cheng, and 300 bales from Da Chang. The closing prices are listed below:</p>
<p>Human Standard Closing Prices: Rise/Fall Account Balance</p>
<p>April 1469 Rise 140 550</p>
<p>January 1429 Rise 1 24 550</p>
<p>May 1478 29 550</p>

<p>June 1483 Fall 5 9350</p>
<p>March 1459 Rise 4 54 900</p>
<p>Total 205,200</p>
<p>(Continuous Rain and Snow Hinder Yarn Sales) Sales of spot yarn are increasingly sluggish due to continuous rain and snow. Total purchases by various groups for the day were only 245 bales. Prices were similar to the previous day. The purchase amounts by various groups are as follows:</p>
<p>Guangdong 160, Zhenjiang 10, Fellow Traders 5, Inland 65, Anqing 5.</p>
<h3 id="e194">Factory Empty; Compensation for This Month's Cotton <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>| Distant Futures Also Pick Up Slightly |</p>
<p>The cotton market started weak but then strengthened. American cotton was flat, and gold prices continued to decline, causing sentiment to weaken slightly. However, a certain factory compensated for some of its short positions for this month, stabilizing market sentiment, and distant futures rose slightly. Nevertheless, trading remained light. Most on the market are bullish, citing continuous rain and mold, and frozen inland rivers making transportation difficult.</p>
<p>(Stable Zheng Standard) The Zheng Standard market opened weak, following foreign cotton, with trading light. Prices for all months fell by five fen to one and a half qian. In the afternoon, major short sellers compensated for this month's positions, pulling up distant futures. Prices for all months rose by one qian to one and a half qian. The total trading volume for the day was 26,800 dan. Sales included 2,600 dan from Chun Ji, 1,200 dan from Sui Long, 1,300 dan from Yuan Da, and 800 dan from Yuan Da, 700 dan from Ji Feng. Purchases included 1,100 dan from Heng De, 1,200 dan from Ren Feng, 1,400 dan from Yi Chang, and 8,100 dan from Chang Feng, 1,000 dan from Da Chang. The closing prices are as follows:</p>

<p>June 5455 05 26,800</p>
<p>March 3375 115,900</p>
<p>Total 515,200</p>
<p>(Weak Factory Demand) Factory demand for spot cotton has stopped again. Arrivals are estimated at 400 bales of Tonghua cotton, and the Yong An Factory took in 400 bales of Shaanxi cotton at 33.25, sending them to the factory.</p>
<h3 id="e195">English and Indian Cotton Industry Weekly News <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>(Mumbai) Market conditions were firm last week. News from New York was unfavorable. Hedging increased due to an influx of Indian arrivals. Export inquiries were poor, and Japan was also indifferent. In the next two to three weeks, shipments are expected to be healthy, but whether this will offset the influx is questionable, as the weather is quite favorable for cotton picking. Interpretations of American cotton measures varied in this market. However, the basis for optimism lies not in facts but in faith. The following is a statistical appendix for the past week (in thousands of bales):</p>
<p>1931 1932</p>
<p>Receipts since September 1st Total 453 559</p>
<p>Current at Weekend 393 563</p>

<p>To China 120 3</p>
<p>To Japan 191 241</p>
<p>To Other Places 18 6</p>
<p>(Liverpool) Spot sales were brisk last week. Futures trading was flat. Market conditions were firm. There was hedging on the weekend, mostly selling old cotton and buying new cotton. Egyptian cotton was weak due to unfavorable news from Alexandria.</p>
<h3 id="e196">Grains: Rice Market Downriver Weakens Due to Rain <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, due to rain, only sixty-odd boats arrived. Wholesale and retail sales were stagnant, causing the market to fall. Prices for rice from Suzhou and Tongbang fell by three or four jiao. Prices for Nan Gang Qing Jiao, Changbang, and other white polished and thin rice varieties successively decreased by two or three jiao. However, Du Yang Jian rice, lacking stock, was able to hold its ground, varying in price to suit the market, and so was slightly weaker.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, thirty-odd boats arrived from downriver. Early market retail sales of white polished rice were slightly better, but in the afternoon, shop sales were slow, causing market conditions to fall by two jiao. Due to continuous rain, little was sold. Thin rice and early rice arrivals continued, with retail sales being even, and market conditions decreased by two or three jiao. Arrival and sales of Yangbu Jian were even, and the market trend was stable. High-quality Du Jian rice was scarce, with mid-grade rice slightly available, but turnover was stagnant, and prices were slightly out of line. Although arrivals of variable yin rice were not strong, retail sales were normal, and prices were down by two or three jiao.</p>
<h3 id="e197">Foreign Rice Orders Are Again Viable <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>Customer Indica Sales Are Sluggish and Expected to Remain Flat</p>
<p>Yesterday's customer indica market conditions were affected by the influx of Du rice from downriver and falling prices. Importers were cautious, intending to lower prices, while cargo owners, due to high costs and limited stock, were unwilling to sell at lower prices. Therefore, Xiang province indica and other rice varieties were mostly held back from sale. In the afternoon, the Quanzhou group sold 450 bags of high-quality Ganwan rice, and because the Ganwan rice stock was even scarcer, prices were able to hold.</p>
<p>The foreign rice market has been quiet for a long time, with a remaining stock of more than 300,000 bags, but all of it is in the hands of foreign merchants who are unwilling to sell. However, foreign telegrams reported small gains. Yesterday, Yuan Li Foreign Firm telegraphed a price of 4 taels, 3 qian and 5 fen for Saigon rice number 1 for March and April shipments, which translates to only about 9.2 yuan in the Shanghai market. Since the current spot price in the Shanghai market is 9.5 yuan, there is a possibility that it is again viable. However, rice merchants have suffered greatly from foreign rice in the past two years, and even if it is viable, they are afraid to make inquiries, having been burned before.</p>
<h3 id="e198">Flour and Wheat Fall in Tandem Amid Continuous Price Drops in Foreign Wheat <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>Fu Xin Fixed Australian Wheat at 1.5 Ships for Only 3 Taels, 6 Qian and 7 Fen</p>
<p>The flour market is generally weak and spiritless. Foreign wheat quotations continue to fall by about two jiao. Sentiment regarding near and distant futures has now also changed. Although spot goods are still scarce this month, customer groups are selling back due to the completion of shipments. Distant months have seen consecutive transactions for foreign wheat in very large quantities (one shipment of 9,000 tons was traded last Saturday, with a March shipment price of 3 taels and 7 qian). Yesterday, it was reported that Fu Xin had again fixed Australian wheat at 1.5 ships for March shipment, with the price reduced to 3 taels, 6 qian and 7 fen. The dumping of foreign wheat continues as before, causing sentiment to become unsettled again. Additionally, due to the Lunar New Year, buyers are becoming quiet, making the market even more desolate. As a result, this month's futures fell by one fen and a half compared to the previous week, February futures fell by one fen and three li, March futures fell by one fen and two and a half li, April futures fell by one fen and a half, May futures fell by one fen and two and a half li, and June futures fell by one fen and seven and a half li.</p>
<p>The wheat market unanimously showed a sharp decline. With foreign wheat quotations continuing to fall by two jiao, and with general floating, the market is naturally weak and soft. The degree of decline in each month varies, with March being the most affected. This month's futures are weaker because of recent foreign wheat imports, and traders are preparing to take delivery (currently berthed at buoys 3 and 4). Distant futures have seen continuous foreign wheat transactions, with prices gradually falling. These factors easily affect the psychology of bulls, so opening prices do not show any recovery, and subsequent actions, such as mass selling, could easily cause further fluctuations. As a result, this month's futures were slightly better by one fen, February futures fell by three fen, March futures fell by five fen, and April futures fell by five fen. According to the Chicago wheat report on the 14th, wheat fell by 0.5 to 0.75 fen due to a weak Liverpool market and poor export demand. 20 million bushels were traded on the 13th. Market prices are listed below:</p>
<p>Closing Price Compared to Previous Day</p>
<p>May 47.75 Down 0.25</p>

<p>The yellow bean market is trending stable, with slight trading in high-quality beans. Turnover of middle-quality beans is stagnant. Currently, both buyers and sellers are not in a hurry, so market conditions are unchanged. Inland grain mills bought three truckloads of Dalian beans, and factories bought one truckload of Zhengyangguan beans, and one truckload each of Linhuaiguan and Tancheng beans. The Wentai group bought 200 bags of Pudong Du beans, and another 170 bags were bought by Muji Street. The oil market remains tight, and Yutai and Tongtai imported 150 pieces of raw oil, with prices at 13 taels and 3 qian.</p>

<p>Since the outbreak of war, the source of Sichuan silk had been cut off. Now that Sichuan Province has been pacified, merchants are shipping the accumulated yellow silk from the production areas to Shanghai one after another. Last week, Yangtze River steamers from Hankou transported a total of 540 pieces of Sichuan factory silk and coarse yellow silk.</p>

<p>Sources of Changcheng and Liujiang Coal Cut Off</p>
<p>Weak Inventories... Market Prices Soar</p>
<p>Recently, the fighting in Shimenzhai has been fierce, and the sources of Changcheng and Liujiang coal have suddenly been cut off. Sea coal inventory can only supply for half a month, causing panic in the coal industry, resulting in soaring prices. Yesterday, the company had no spot goods for sale, and wholesale prices among traders in the market soared further. In particular, Liujiang lump coal was called up to around 15 taels per ton from 13 taels, 7 qian and 5 fen, and small lump coal was also called up to 12 taels. Changcheng white coal also rose by about two taels, and now sells for 16 taels, 5 qian per ton.</p>

<h3 id="e227">Master and Apprentice (2) <a href="#e227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>-- Shou Juan</p>
<p>The master took a sip of white spirits, his chatterbox opened; "We poor people just need to be patient, and honest when doing things, 'Heaven will not disappoint those who suffer!' You'll never have to worry about starving to death! Da Mao, you don't know! I had it even harder than you when I was a kid! My dad died when I was six! My mom died when I was ten! I was left with nothing, no relatives or friends, and there wasn't a grain of food left in the house! Luckily, Uncle Wang next door, took pity on me and asked me to look after his cows, so I lived at his house for two or three years. When I was thirteen, Uncle Wang recommended me to the Maochang blacksmith shop in town to be an apprentice. That's how I learned this hard trade! Later, the master saw that I was willing to endure hardship! That I had a good heart! So he married his daughter to me! But after a few years, Maochang closed down because business was slow. And in that year, Azhen's mother also died! That year must have been when I was down on my luck! I was so disheartened that I didn't want to do anything. But in the end, I felt so sorry for Azhen, so I worked as a day laborer every day! After many years of hard work, I finally saved up a little money, and painstakingly opened this shop. Now, at least everyone has enough to eat! Seeing Azhen growing up to be pleasing to the eye, I feel content!"</p>
<p>The master took another sip of white spirits, and looked at his daughter. His daughter remained silent, obediently sitting by the stove to start the fire. The master's gaze turned to my face.</p>
<p>"It's just that I don't have a son; if Da Mao is good, and works hard, I'll marry Azhen to you. You two would be a good match!"</p>
<p>I was so happy that I almost cut my finger with the kitchen knife. I looked at Azhen, who was blushing and lowering her head.</p>
<p>"What are you smiling about!"</p>
<p>My heart is really smiling!</p>
<p>One morning, the master had to go to town. He said that recently there had been floods in various rural areas, soldiers were fighting, and they were constantly passing through. The servants nearby were either dead or gone, and all the fields were abandoned. The big pile of scythes, hoes, sickles, ······ that we made in the shop every autumn had no sales at all today. So the master was worried and wanted to go to town himself to hawk them.</p>
<p>After the master left, my apprentice sister and I were playing with coppers in the house.</p>
<p>I flicked my copper with my thumb and it rolled straight to the threshold. Azhen didn't pay attention, and it landed flat, bouncing only a few inches away with a "slap".</p>
<p>"It's crooked! It doesn't count! It doesn't count!" I was about to use my copper to hit hers, but Azhen picked up her copper and said coquettishly, "I'm cheating! I won't do it," and I got angry and started to walk out.</p>
<p>"Come on! Come on!" Azhen hurriedly waved her hand.</p>
<p>"Can you cheat from far away?"</p>
<p>"I won't cheat anymore!"</p>
<p>I came back in, Azhen's cheeks were bulging and red! Her two eyes were staring straight into my heart.</p>
<p>"Shame on you! Winning your own family's money!"</p>
<p>The sun shone into our shop. The master came back, followed by a middle-aged man in a melon-shaped cap and a leather jacket with a turned-up collar.</p>
<p>The master said, "This is Sixth Granduncle from Master Chun's house. Master Chun specifically asked him to come to our house to choose some furniture for the wedding! Da Mao! Pour Granduncle some tea!"</p>
<p>I poured a cup of tea and handed it to the young man with both hands. But the young man didn't even look at me straight. His eyes were fixed on Azhen, darting around. (To be continued)</p>
<h3 id="e228">Launching a National Revolutionary War <a href="#e228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>-- Ziguzi</p>
<p>Everyone knows that since the September 18th Incident, the Japanese imperialists have intensified their aggression against our country, with the unprecedented global economic panic as its "driving force." Only the muddleheaded and ignorant believe that it is due to the rash actions of a few Japanese warlords or an accidental unfortunate event. Everyone knows that for the Japanese imperialists' acts of aggression, we have no other way to go except to mobilize the whole country to seek self-defense and self-salvation through our own efforts. Only the timid and cowardly believe that non-resistance can win the sympathy of the world and strive for final victory. The fact is as clear as iron: Since the September 18th Incident, Japan's aggression has only increased, and our policy of non-resistance is just sitting and waiting to be slaughtered, closing our eyes and waiting for death. If we don't wake up now, when will we?</p>
<p>Moreover, the recent public opinion of the great powers towards Japan is even more clearly in support of Japan. The British government's propaganda machine said: "Our former allies are sacrificing for the world and preparing for a decisive battle with the Soviet Union. We should help with the affairs of North China, not interfere." The French media is just busy declaring that the "Franco-Japanese Alliance" and the "Franco-Japanese Secret Agreement" are not facts, and does not comment on the substance of the matter. Italy said it even better: "Who cares, let the Orientals kill each other for a while." This is the "public opinion" of the world, and it is also the harvest of our appeals and pleas since the September 18th Incident. The facts have already clearly pointed out: Under the impact of the global economic panic, in order to struggle for its last destiny, the steps of the imperialists have been consistent. Although their mutual contradictions are also increasingly sharpened, they will always stand on the same front with regard to "another kind of struggle" and the slaughter of weak nations.</p>
<p>Therefore, at present, we must never beg for mercy from the devil again, and we must never sit and wait for death any longer. We can only launch a national revolutionary war and fight to the death against the powerful enemy for our own future and the future of the world. We should not think that this is an echoing sound from the sea, because we also have our own "united front."</p>
<h3 id="e229">New Spring <a href="#e229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>-- Zhou Lengjia</p>
<p>Silently, I accepted this New Spring of 1933.</p>
<p>Outside the Guanzhong, imperialists are wantonly carrying out massacres, guns are booming, and blood is splashing.</p>
<p>Shanghai, this paradise built on hell, is still decadent and extravagant, a world of prosperity.</p>
<p>Many people are shouting about entertainment to save the country, and many people are busy dancing and selecting flowers.</p>
<p>At the Tianchan Stage, Dr. Mei is performing, and the audience is packed.</p>
<p>On North Sichuan Road, in the rows of dance halls, harmonious and pleasant jazz music is playing vigorously; a large group of young people, with their arms around the waists of the dancers, are dancing the foxtrot, tango, and waltz to the rhythm of the music.</p>
<p>Movie theaters are opening their big mouths, and fashionable men and women are flocking in like bees. Large movie advertisements are plastered everywhere on the walls: a foreign girl kicks up a bare leg. Under the bare leg, five big characters, "Crazy Saturday."</p>
<p>Streetcars, ding! ding! ding! Cars, woo! woo! woo! The people sitting in the cars, the men with rosy faces, the women delicate and charming, laugh intoxicatingly.</p>
<p>The wild wind is blowing, like a ghost calling.</p>
<p>An old news vendor, holding up his arm high, shouts out a thunderclap with all his might. "Extra! Want to buy it? Japanese soldiers have entered Shanhaiguan, and 1,800 Chinese have died."</p>
<p>The thunderbolt flies straight into the sky, and when it hits the sky, it falls down, straight into everyone's heart.</p>
<p>The stores, the banners for big sales cover the space. Copper drums, dong! dong! tong! Foreign horns, beep! beep! Blowing and beating, playing together: "The first month is the New Spring..."</p>
<p>The wireless telephone is broadcasting, ji li gu lu, Lu hee hee, Qin ha ha.</p>
<p>An old woman in rags is staring intently at a woman in a fur coat.</p>
<h3 id="e230">Soviet Theater <a href="#e230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>-- Zhao Mingyi</p>
<p>Soviet theater is inseparable from socialist construction. In other words, theater in the Soviet Union is also a part of socialist construction.</p>
<p>Before the First Five-Year Plan, the content of Soviet theater was the use of very stimulating, destructive themes in scripts. At that time, the main task of theater was to clearly point out the importance of the revolution for the liberation of the proletariat; but from the beginning of the Five-Year Plan, the proletariat itself rose up to create new forms of art. Before, they were just passive spectators, but now they have become active participants in artistic creation.</p>
<p>Looking at the directory of theater during the implementation of the First Five-Year Plan, we find that many of them take the current Five-Year Plan of a particular industrial or cultural sector as their theme, to describe their backwardness in production, lack of technology, and the sabotage of the liquidationists, and how to achieve or exceed the planned success. In particular, the development of heavy industry, the collectivization of agriculture, and the eradication of illiteracy, theater undertook its combat mission.</p>
<p>Now let us take an example to illustrate. On the Soviet stage, the following story was once performed.</p>
<p>When the curtain opens, the stage is a barren land, and the farmers are cultivating it with old-fashioned farm tools. Some of them are complaining, so a Trotskyist propagandizes to them that it is absolutely impossible to implement socialism in agriculture. As a result, many people are shaken and become pessimistic. The young shock brigade members among these farmers have advocated using tractors to cultivate the land from the beginning, but the stubborn guys in general do not believe in the truth of this reasoning no matter what. At this time, the young people propose to borrow tractors from the government. When everyone is disappointed, this proposal is reluctantly passed.</p>
<p>Then the stage scene changes, and a huge tractor crosses the stage, and the new land is cultivated. At the end, a field of golden wheat is presented in front of the audience, and everyone cheers. People have won, hearts have won, and socialist construction can proceed.</p>
<p>○ ○ ○ ○ ○</p>
<p>The Five-Year Plan also had a special product in Soviet theater, namely Tram (Youth Workers' Theater Troupe). Tram is different from the past in terms of the form and content of theater, and it is also completely different in Idevoroki. It grasps dialectical materialism as the basis of its activities. That is to say, all theatrical activities must be material and dialectical in development. Therefore, they were able to directly help the work of "completing the Five-Year Plan in four years" and overcome many important difficulties in production.</p>
<p>Now the Second Five-Year Plan has begun, and in the meantime, the main goals of Soviet theater are: 1. Eliminate the imbalance and opposition between cities and villages, establish a large number of rural theaters, organize more shock theater troupes, and AgitProp; 2. Bring the culture of many backward nations to the highest level; 3. Thoroughly eliminate the remnants of capitalism and eliminate the relationship of exploitation of people by people. This is of course consistent with the overall plan.</p>
<p>Long Creation</p>
<h3 id="e231">The Crossroads of Era and Love (Continued) <a href="#e231" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c231" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">231</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Ziping</p>
<p>No matter what, it's hard to deny that there is love between the two of them. If this love is allowed to deepen, it is extremely dangerous. No matter what, even if not for myself, I must keep Peizhu pure. The blood in my body is absolutely pure! Except for Peizhu, the noble and beautiful object of my love, my purity must not be released for other women. Even if Zhuo Shuhua, that pure and chaste woman, comes to challenge me, I must actively resist, and resist for a long time! Moreover, towards Hezi, who is of a different race, and my father's concubine, and a middle-aged woman who is almost thirty years old, even if I cannot strictly defend my country, I cannot completely remove the barriers. If I still harbor this ignoble thought, then I am a useless degenerate! I am a dignified Chinese man, and I should firmly uphold the reputation of the descendants of the Yellow Emperor!······</p>
<p>Thinking of this, Haiquan unconsciously clenched his fists and hammered his head three times.</p>
<p>"Even if she weren't my father's concubine, even if she weren't a middle-aged woman, even if she were like that beautiful Japanese girl, I should still maintain the status of a great Chinese citizen, and shouldn't fall so easily, to be looked down upon by the Japanese devils!······"</p>
<p>As he was lost in thought, Madam Hezi, even more beautifully made up than before, and wearing her favorite fashionable clothes, walked into his room with a smile. As soon as Haiquan saw her, his heart pounded again, and the "Chinese soul" he had just mustered seemed to melt away in Madam Hezi's beautiful appearance.</p>
<p>"Oh my, hasn't the maid brought breakfast yet?"</p>
<p>She asked him with a smile. At first, she was serious, but after saying that, she smiled again. As soon as he saw her smile, his whole body seemed to soften.</p>
<p>"Useless! I'm still useless! My spirit is really weak!"</p>
<p>Before long, the maid brought two servings of breakfast.</p>
<p>"From this morning on, I will accompany Mr. Lin to eat every meal. Mr. Lin is not allowed to eat outside!"</p>
<p>She said coquettishly.</p>
<p>"What about them?"</p>
<p>Haiquan was still concerned about that Japanese man and that Japanese girl.</p>
<p>"Never mind them! Tell the maid to send it to them!"</p>

<h3 id="e232">Deception and Exploitation <a href="#e232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>— Zhen Liu</p>
<p>"Deception, exploitation," these four words are sometimes used by foreigners for international political competition, to seek the interests of one country. The Chinese have always used them internally to seek personal gain. By comparison, there is a world of difference! We should remember that during the European War, Wilson said, "Breaking the German dream of unifying the world by force is to seek peace for the world and liberation for small and weak nations." These beautiful words stirred the hearts of small and weak nations, so they believed that Wilson's words were true. Therefore, each small and weak nation resolutely and sincerely joined the Allied front and fought against Germany. As a result, Germany was defeated, and the European War ended. Not only did the victorious imperialists not grant self-determination and autonomy to the small and weak nations, but they also formed the League of Nations as a base camp for imperialism to control the small and weak nations, redistribute spoils, and subjugate them again, so that they would forever be under their iron hooves, without a chance to rise up. It can be seen that the imperialists are all standing in the position of a country's interests, and there is no doubt that they are deceiving and exploiting small and weak nations.</p>
<p>Let us further observe. From the September 18th Incident to the present, it has been more than a year. The violent Japanese invasion is still pressing towards the interior of our country. How can the League of Nations have the determination to sanction the violent Japanese? Doesn't the League of Nations superficially invite the United States and Russia to attend and discuss the Sino-Japanese issue? In essence, it is using the United States and Russia's attendance at the League of Nations as an expression of peace in the Far East, invisibly dispelling the United States and Russia's strategy of attacking Japan, and invisibly deceiving the Chinese government's clever plan. However, our great officials are still singing merrily in leaky boats, engaging in lofty discussions to deceive the national public and exploiting each other to consolidate their personal positions. They are just holding positions without doing any work, putting the country aside. "When those in authority lose their way, the people will scatter." This has made China a complete mess, beyond repair. The reason is that few of us are dedicated to doing things, and many are dedicated to being officials. Few are seeking the interests of the public, and many are exploiting the public. Those above act like those below, and this has become a common practice. They compete for power and seek to satisfy their personal hopes of promotion and wealth, resulting in a militarized and bureaucratic China, a deceptive and hypocritical society, where everyone is cheating and deceiving each other, and engaging in intrigue. This is simply digging one's own grave and inviting one's own destruction.</p>
<p>However, what is past is gone, but what is to come can be pursued. From now on, we should wash our faces and renew our hearts, strive to create a genuine society, eliminate the evils of deception and exploitation, and mold everyone to have a mentality of forgetting one's family for the sake of the country, and forgetting one's self for the sake of the public, and to have the concept of sacrificing one's family to relieve the country's difficulties. Even if the country reaches a point of no return, we must work together to overcome difficulties, turn danger into safety, and reach the shore of salvation. I hope we will all "think thrice"!</p>
<p>Namo Amitabha, please recite it one thousand times or one hundred times or ten times, and you will receive ten kinds of merits in this life.</p>
<p>Mr. Ye Jingfeng: I have forgotten your address and cannot send you a letter. Please come to the Shen Bao office for a talk after seeing this notice. Yao Zichu.</p>

<p>— Zhuo Han</p>
<p>Lie Zi once rode the wind, and Lu Ban ascended wooden birds. The past is difficult to verify in history, but today people's skills have just begun. Light cars with silver wings, initially circling on the ground, slowly rising into the sky, with a view of mountains and rivers becoming small. In an instant, thousands of miles, wandering in all directions, pushing through the clouds to the ninth heaven, the sky is high and the white sun is bright. There are also those that fly on the water, surging through the waves, so agile. I am amazed by the wonders of creation, but I only see the ingenuity of people's minds. It is a pity that new weapons are used to disturb mediocre people. The world competes to strengthen their armies, sharpening their fangs and claws. The offensive is launched from the ninth heaven, overlooking everything clearly. Thousands of pounds of sulfur and fire are thrown, and dangerous buildings burn on the bursting ground. Imagining aerial battles, long smoke covers the castles. Thousands of groups of chaotic crows rise, with good skills both above and below. Machine guns fire with a "pa-pa" sound, and flying cannons sweep through the air. There are also those who run out of ammunition and resort to the ram's attack. Broken heads and folded wings, falling like rain on the trees. Flesh and blood fall like mush, and the smoke of burning bodies curls up. I hope to become powder, and the territory will be preserved. Alas, my country is ill, and its plans are sparse and preparations are few. Shanghai is still scorched earth, and Yanyun is about to become a swamp. I heard that aerial defenses are being built, and it is better to mend the fold early.</p>

<h3 id="e234">Talking about Milk <a href="#e234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>— Xin</p>
<p>We have long recognized "milk" as a nutritious food, especially Europeans and Americans, who consume it almost every day. It is generally divided into three types: fresh milk, canned condensed milk, and powdered milk. Now, I will describe them separately:</p>
<p>Fresh Milk</p>
<p>Composition of Milk: To know the relationship between milk and human nutrition, we must first understand its composition. Fresh milk is a white liquid obtained directly from the udders of dairy cows. Its specific gravity is about 1.033. It contains 84% water, 4% butter, 5% casein, and 5% lactose. In addition, it also contains a small amount of inorganic salts (such as calcium phosphate), vitamins A and D, and several yeasts that are beneficial to human digestion, such as trypsin, pepsin, and lipase. Milk also contains dissolved gases (such as hydrogen and nitrogen).</p>
<p>The Relationship Between Milk and Human Nutrition: The nutrients we need in food are nothing more than fats, carbohydrates, proteins, and indispensable vitamins. Since we know the composition of milk as above, we immediately recognize milk as a nutritious substance. Because almost all the nutrients needed by the human body are present in milk: butter for fats, lactose for carbohydrates, casein for proteins, and two kinds of vitamins, as well as calcium phosphate, which is important for bones. Furthermore, much of what we eat can be digested and absorbed by the body with the help of corresponding enzymes. Lipase can digest fats. In the acidic environment of the stomach, pepsin helps to digest proteins into amino acids, which can then be absorbed by the intestines. Trypsin can also help to digest proteins, but without the need for hydrochloric acid. Looking at the above points, it is undeniable that milk is considered to be quite nutritious.</p>
<p>Milk that has been exposed to the air for a long time will turn sour, and at the same time, the oxygen will coagulate into lumps due to the effect of acidity. This is because an enzyme in the air, called lactic ferment, causes the lactose to oxidize into lactic acid. Moreover, there are many microorganisms in the air, and milk is very suitable for the growth of bacteria, so it spoils easily.</p>
<p>Since milk contains yeast and vitamins, it should not be heated to too high a temperature when consumed, otherwise, the vitamins and yeast it contains will be destroyed, and its nutritional value will undoubtedly be reduced. However, if the milk contains bacteria, it should be boiled to prevent infection.</p>
<p>Sterilized Milk: Since milk is directly consumed, its unsanitary condition can transmit diseases. We know that if the cows that supply milk are sick, their milk often contains pathogens. The most common and dangerous is Mycobacterium tuberculosis. More than half of the cows have this disease. Therefore, to avoid this danger, milk is sterilized before being sold in dairy farms. As a result, "A" milk, sterilized milk, Pasteurized milk, etc., are commonly seen on the market. Pasteurized milk is sterilized using Pasteur's high-pressure steam sterilization method. "A" milk is sterilized milk that has been inspected by the Public Works Department as superior milk. There are two sterilization methods. One is high-pressure steam sterilization, in which milk is placed in a sterilizing pot and high-pressure steam is passed through it. The other sterilization method is low-pressure sterilization. In this method, milk is sterilized in a low-pressure environment. In other words, because the air pressure is reduced, it can be sterilized without using high temperature, so there is little change to the inherent components of milk.</p>
<p>Condensed Milk</p>
<p>Ordinary condensed milk is mostly a yellowish-white viscous substance, packaged in cans, and tastes very sweet. Its production method is to concentrate fresh milk with heat or steam, and add sucrose to increase the sweetness. Because the amount of water evaporated is not fixed, its composition cannot be accurately calculated. The water content in ordinary condensed milk is only 26%, and the percentage of other components is therefore increased. Butter is 95%, casein is 10%, lactose is 16%, and sucrose is about 04%. Therefore, when drinking condensed milk, it must be mixed with water so that its composition is the same as fresh milk.</p>
<p>Condensed milk is convenient for use and preservation, especially for travelers. However, because it is concentrated using heat, the vitamins and beneficial yeast in it have already disappeared. Furthermore, if the metal in the can containing this condensed milk contains poisonous substances such as lead, it can make the condensed milk unsuitable for hygiene.</p>
<p>Powdered Milk</p>
<p>Powdered milk is widely used because it is easy to carry. The production method of powdered milk is to evaporate fresh milk to dryness at a relatively low temperature, which takes a long time. The components of powdered milk are of course more abundant than those contained in condensed milk. However, to obtain a beautiful, smooth, light, and dry powdered milk, part or all of the butter is often removed to avoid the powdered milk from clumping together, so its composition is not fixed. Therefore, its nutritional value cannot be determined, and preservatives are often added to powdered milk to prevent fermentation and spoilage. It should be known that no matter what kind of preservative is not suitable for the human body. Therefore, users of powdered milk must be cautious.</p>

<p>— Chen Zhou</p>
<p>It was late at night, and the snow was still falling non-stop, piling up more than three inches thick in the courtyard, shining white. The crazy north wind was raging, rattling the outer windows. A stove was burning in the house, and the Yuan Shu family was sitting around the stove, talking about urgent news about the war. A kettle on the stove was boiling vigorously, and Yuan Shu removed the lid of the kettle.</p>
<p>"Dad! Many volunteer soldiers have arrived here again today!" Yuan Shu's son Lang said, already eighteen years old.</p>
<p>"Knock! Knock! Knock!" Someone knocked on the door, the servant opened the door, and a person walked in.</p>
<p>"I am here on behalf of the regiment commander. I request that you allow the sorghum on the willow tree pier not to be cut down, in order to facilitate military operations."</p>
<p>"Please sit down, and we can talk," Yuan Shu personally brought a stool for the person to sit on. "It's okay not to cut it down, but how many comrades do you have here now?"</p>
<p>"Not many, only about three hundred. We are here urgently to resist the enemy on the orders of our superiors, so we lack bullets and food. Please help us!"</p>
<p>"Yes! What this brother said is right. We must do it for the country and for ourselves! Dad! Seeing the enemy attacking here, how can our volunteer soldiers resist without bullets and food! Our happy family is built on the country. If the country dies, our happy family will also be gone, and our flesh and blood will be separated... Moreover, there is the stinky name and shame of being slaves of a conquered nation... Dad! Saving the country is saving ourselves! Naturally, we can't talk about sacrificing our family to relieve the country's difficulties, but we must do our best! Dad! You contribute money, and I contribute effort. I will go with this brother and join the volunteer army to kill all those unreasonable enemies!"</p>
<p>"What about your wife?"</p>
<p>"Forget about her!"</p>
<p>"That won't do!"</p>
<p>"Dad, look! Chen Gang next door and Fan Pinshan across the street have all joined the volunteer army! Don't they also have wives? Pinshan's wife is even following her husband to be a medic!"</p>
<p>"I'm going too!" It was Lang's wife's voice.</p>
<p>"Good! Comrade!" Lang and his wife shook hands.</p>
<p>"I can't... I can't stop you, because everyone's body belongs to the country! Go! Fight and struggle for our country and nation! I won't be sad because you leave me! What makes me sad now is: our National Defense Army usually sits and eats military pay, why don't they resist when foreign enemies come? They want you, this group of immature young people, to defend against the enemy! Go! I wish you success!"</p>
<p>"Goodbye!" The three said in unison, leaving without looking back.</p>
<p>With a "bang," the door closed again.</p>
<p>"Alas! God! Where has our government gone?" Yuan Shu cried.</p>

<h3 id="e237">Rise Up and Take Action <a href="#e237" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c237" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">237</a></h3>
<p>Editor:</p>
<p>The conclusion of "How to Resist Japan's Research" in the clerk communication column of your newspaper on January 9 is: 1) Economic severance; 2) Preparation for armed resistance; 3) Enhancement of personal knowledge. And you have adopted my humble opinion: "Those who have the strength should contribute strength, and those who have money should contribute money."</p>
<p>I now have another idea: to rise up and take action. We Chinese have a big problem! We only know how to talk, but we can't act. Paper talk is not unflowery, but the reality is equal to zero. From today onwards, we should thoroughly correct our past mistakes. Those who sit and talk must be able to stand up and act.</p>
<p>Some people may ask, "What about yourself? Aren't you also committing this big mistake?" I dare to answer this very frankly, "No." I originally wanted to join the volunteer army. Because the government has not issued an order to send troops to recover the lost territory, where should I go to serve? I have grandparents. Although I can't bear to abandon them temporarily, I have four brothers. It doesn't matter if one person dies. So, once the government decides to issue an order to send troops to resist Japan, I can disregard everything, join the volunteer army, and kill a few enemies before dying, to fulfill my wish to "die for the country." Even before I die, if I unfortunately cannot kill the enemy (which is very common on the battlefield), then dying on the battlefield to defend the country is also seeking benevolence and attaining benevolence, and I can die in peace.</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, I read in the newspaper that General Bai Chongxi replied to Mr. Wang Xiaolai's telegram, "Except for avenging the shame, resisting Japan, and suppressing the communists, I will never participate in any internal disputes." General Bai also replied to the Abandon War Association's telegram, "Unite to face foreign enemies and save the country from danger together." I hope that all the military officers in the country will have the same determination as General Bai, point their guns outward, and unite to resist Japan, so that I can find a place to die.</p>
<p>Editor: Please allow me to use a corner of your valuable newspaper as my oath to make this determination!</p>
<p>Ying Zhongyuan</p>
<p>Editor's note: After reading Mr. Ying's letter full of patriotic feelings, what else can we say besides admiration? But as the ancients said, "If you are prepared for everything, you will succeed." Since Mr. Ying has this ambition and determination, he should prepare at this time, such as joining the merchant corps, joining the defense团, and reading more books on military knowledge. In particular, it is best to join the army immediately, because in combat, the need for experience is more urgent than empty theory. "Wrapped in horse hide" and "swear not to return alive" are the spirit that a soldier should have. In fact, it is also necessary to demand tactical improvements to avoid unnecessary sacrifices. "There is a difference between those who act without learning and those who have been learning all along." This statement is not deceiving us!</p>

<p>Deadline for Joint Exemption from Fees for Calligraphers and Painters: Calligraphers He Danmin, Zhang Feixiong, Zhang Yanmou, and Wu Jiren specialize in the four styles of calligraphy: regular, running, cursive, and seal, with powerful and vigorous strokes. Whether they are tiny or large characters, they have reached the realm of perfection. Painters Qian Zongan, the weary traveler Hu Junlu Ying, specialize in landscapes, figures, flowers, birds, and animals, as well as antiquities and ink dragons. Their paintings are extraordinary and classic, with poetry in every painting. Together, they have formed the National Quintessence Calligraphy and Painting Research Society at No. 38 Wangyun Road in the city, mutually learning and discussing art. Meng Jin, in order to connect with people across the country and forge relationships through calligraphy and painting, exempts all fees, only charging 30% of the cost of paper and ink. Throwing a brick can attract jade, so those who seek it come one after another, and they are very busy. They have also printed special sample sheets of cheap fees, and those who request them by mail can send seven points. It is planned to end the method of exemption from fees at the end of the old calendar year to take a break.</p>

<h3 id="e246">The Importance of Opening a Large Eastern Port and the Steps to Implement It (Continued) Shanghai Architectural Society <a href="#e246" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c246" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">246</a></h3>
<p>— Du Yange</p>
<p>Shanghai, holding the throat of the Yangtze River, is the convergence point of the two railways, Jinghu (Beijing-Shanghai) and Huhangyong (Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo), and a gathering place for ocean liners. Convenient transportation, finance, industry, and culture are concentrated here, creating China's only large commercial port. Furthermore, due to the instability of domestic politics and society, and the precarious lives of people in the interior, those with even a small amount of assets regard Shanghai as a haven and flock to it, causing the population to increase daily, and the outward appearance to become more prosperous. Moreover, since the National Government established its capital in Nanjing, officials and dignitaries have continuously travelled the Jinghu route, with prominent figures of the party and the nation either residing in the concessions or socializing in foreign venues. Therefore, Shanghai not only holds an important position economically, but also carries considerable political significance. The prosperity of Shanghai is indeed something that we can acknowledge with our own senses.</p>
<p>However, Shanghai's prosperity is inversely proportional to our national affairs. What is the reason? It can be understood by observing past events. For example, every time a man-made disaster or natural calamity occurs in the interior, Shanghai's population increases accordingly, and Shanghai's surface becomes even more prosperous. In that case, isn't such prosperity of Shanghai the same as the decline of the interior? Therefore, I say: Shanghai's prosperity is inversely proportional to national affairs. Shanghai's abnormal development is caused by the turmoil in the interior. Those with simple minds who see the superficial prosperity of Shanghai and feel complacent are no different from being deaf and blind to the overall situation. In fact, indulging in Shanghai is like a fish swimming in a pot about to boil. If we do not quickly reflect on ourselves, we will inevitably face the danger of perishing together. Writing to this point, I cannot help but shudder.</p>
<p>The institutions responsible for Shanghai's construction and security are three: the Municipal Government, the Public Concession's Works Department, and the French Concession's Board of Directors. The Municipal Government's jurisdiction lies in the urban areas outside the concessions, such as Nanshi (South City), Zhabei, Jiangwan, and Wusong, among which the Nanshi and Zhabei districts are relatively bustling. However, the essence of Zhabei was destroyed in the January 28th Incident, and its restoration will take time. Although Nanshi has a large population, due to historical and economic reasons, its material construction is difficult to advance rapidly. Commercial activities are also unable to compete with the concessions due to the psychology and habits of the people. As for the city center, due to the Municipal Government's financial difficulties after the January 28th Incident and the general trend of people moving towards the western districts, it could not maintain its initial rapid development.</p>
<p>The situation of Shanghai's areas under the Municipal Government's jurisdiction is as described above. It can be seen that the so-called prosperous Shanghai is only the Public Concession and the French Concession, manipulated by foreigners. Therefore, to praise Shanghai as the second New York or the second London is merely to praise foreigners' Shanghai. How can one not feel ashamed speaking of this?</p>
<p>However, the wealth to build a prosperous Shanghai is the lifeblood of us, the yellow-skinned, black-eyed owners of this land. To have our own wealth taken by foreigners to build their prosperous Shanghai shows a glimpse of our compatriots' indolence. To live peacefully in the concessions without any sense of alarm shows that we only have the servility to rely on others and lack the spirit of independence and creation.</p>
<p>Now, everyone should be able to awaken, right? We must rely on our own spirit, intelligence, and wealth to open up our own commercial port to wash away past shame and reclaim our rights and interests. The large port of the Orient, close to Shanghai, is the commercial port designated by Sun Yat-sen. It is superior to Shanghai in terms of geography and human resources. Once successfully opened, its future prosperity will not be difficult to surpass Shanghai. However, we must make efforts as soon as possible to prevent foreigners from getting there first, because there are many foreigners coveting this unique and superior commercial port in the East.</p>
<p>Compatriots with wealth and intelligence, quickly rise up and plan for it! And hope that the government authorities will encourage and assist it with the power of the nation, so that it can be realized in the shortest possible time! Because this is a major construction project related to the economic prosperity and decline of the entire country! (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e249">Overview of Real Estate Transactions in the Eastern District Last Month <a href="#e249" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c249" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">249</a></h3>
<p>— Shang</p>
<p>Amidst the serious situation, the real estate transactions in this port are not as prosperous as before. According to a survey by a real estate company, the eastern district was the most active last month. Several transactions were made in that area, several mortgages were issued at low interest rates, and the prices of several properties have also increased. Furthermore, there have been many inquiries regarding property, which is not a quiet situation. What is particularly gratifying is that the newly completed lane houses are already nineteen-tenths full of tenants. The completion of factories and other buildings, as well as the forthcoming construction on other land, all seem to be clear evidence of continued progress. The recent transactions in this area and its vicinity are as follows:</p>
<p>㈠ Thirty-three mu of vacant land near Shanghai University, with each mu sold for 1,500 taels of standard silver.</p>
<p>㈠ Two and a half mu of vacant land located on Haizhou Road, with a price of 10,000 taels of silver per mu.</p>
<p>㈠ A small property, with a land deed area of approximately nine fen, with shops, etc., recently sold for 27,500 taels of silver.</p>
<p>㈠ The municipal authorities recently acquired a small section of land to widen East Yalu Road.</p>
<p>The Japanese Industrial School near the Zhoujiazui Road police station has now opened. The scaffolding erected by the Zhoujiazui Road police station has been removed, and its exterior is clearly decorated. The office building of the Zilaihuo (gas company) has also been completed, and a gas storage furnace has been erected. The Chinese Wood Manufacturing Company is currently working on its project, and the Lead Industry Factory seems to have been completed and is about to start operations. The factory of the Shanghai Industrial Co., Ltd. on Yulin Road has started construction and is engaged in the manufacture of industrial products. A new factory will soon be established on Hejian Road. Also, the grand new warehouse of Gonghexing is progressing rapidly. The new-style shops on Yangshupu Road have all been completed. As for the newly built lane houses for Chinese residents, which were deserted during the Shanghai Incident, most of them are now rented out. Even those newly built in the past few months are mostly rented out. According to this situation, especially the large number of houses near Yangzhou Road and Huasheng Road, is the most prominent.</p>

<p>— Xin Fu</p>
<p>A tourist who came out of the "New Babylon City" Neubabelsberg Ufa film studio said to others: "Now I know why this place is called "New Babylon City". It turns out that when they work, they speak languages from all over the world, just like when they built the Tower of Babel in the past."</p>
<p>The Ufa film studio occupies an area of over ninety acres. There, there are forty-two large buildings: and many open spaces, building many streets, palaces, thatched cottages, mansions, pastures, forests, pools, bridges and various things used when making films. In those large buildings, there are fourteen one-story and two-story buildings that are warehouses for raw materials and properties, six power plants, three cellars for storing copies, and a large cellar dedicated to storing original film. In addition, there are two very large office buildings, with an average of six to seven hundred workers.</p>
<p>There are a total of three hundred and fifty telephone lines in the film studio, all using automatic machines. Furthermore, the police rules are of course very strict and orderly. "No smoking" signs are everywhere. There are a total of nineteen firefighters stationed in the studio, divided into three locations.</p>
<p>There are two very large and two smaller buildings with nine sound stages. The most magnificent building is the tall building built in 1926 by the famous engineer Staurak, which occupies an area of nine thousand square yards. Inside, there are three large theaters. Around the theaters, there are fifty partitions used as dressing rooms, bathrooms, and makeup rooms for the actors, and the offices of the directors are also included.</p>
<p>There is also another film studio, built in 1929, occupying an area of three thousand eight hundred square yards, with four sound stages inside. The walls and roof are built according to acoustic principles, so there is no interference from noise. Even the sound of thunder during heavy wind and rain cannot penetrate inside. This kind of architecture is indeed worthy of praise. As for everything else about Ufa, I will talk about it another day!</p>
<h3 id="e252">Tom Mix's Horse <a href="#e252" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c252" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">252</a></h3>
<p>— Han</p>
<p>The horsemanship of the horse star Tom Mix can be said to be the most famous in Hollywood. His horse is named Tony, and it can also be regarded as a famous horse that has "experienced many battles". They, one man and one horse, have earned a salary of 7.5 million yuan in the twenty years from 1912 to the present. But when Tom bought that horse in Arizona, he only paid twelve dollars and fifty cents, which is absolutely true.</p>
<p>Now Tony is getting old and retiring due to his increasing age. He enjoys his twilight years in the forest, which is quite entertaining. During his peak, he also traveled to Europe, lived in the stables of the Prince of England, attended a grand banquet held by Londoners at the Savoy Hotel for him and his master, and was ridden by Tom to take an elevator to the top of the Eiffel Tower, the world's largest building.</p>

<h3 id="e254">Swanson's New Film <a href="#e254" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c254" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">254</a></h3>
<p>— Hong</p>
<p>The actress Swanson, who is known for her performance of romantic and charming roles and was once very popular, has not presented us with a second sound film for a long time. I heard that Cathay will recently select and screen Swanson's second masterpiece sound film, which is |Tonight or Never</p>
<p>Swanson is still as touching as her first sound film, "The Merry Widow," and her silent masterpiece Sadie Thompson. In Tonight or Never, she still maintains her style, and is still sensual, delicate, humorous, and romantic. Set against the background of the romantic life in Budapest and Vienna, the film has singing and foolishness. The critics commented on this film: "Ms. Swanson's dialogue in Tonight or Never is excellent, and her expressions are also very good. However, Ms. Swanson lacks the power in this film, which is a pity, so it cannot be called a masterpiece." Whether this critic's criticism is accurate, let us go to Cathay in a few days to criticize it ourselves.</p>
<h3 id="e255">Laughton's Nest <a href="#e255" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c255" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">255</a></h3>
<p>— Zhongqin</p>
<p>When Charles Laughton was in England, he and his wife built a thatched cottage in a secluded place a few miles away from Surrey, where the ancient trees are towering, in the space with the densest shade. He and his wife lived in this thatched cottage. But in the summer, they moved again, building the grass house on top of the trees. The top is still covered with more lush leaves, and they use a long ladder to get in and out. When his friends came to visit him, none of them did not frown and ask him why he did this. He said that it was because he admired the characters of ancient times, so he practiced the life of ancient times. Many people thought he was poor, but his property was actually not small, so this reason is not sufficient. This can only be regarded as one of his quirks.</p>
<p>When he arrived in the United States, he built a thatched cottage in Hollywood in the same way, living on the ground in winter and living on top of the trees in summer. This joke spread throughout the United States, because the whole United States only has thirty-story, sixty-story, one-hundred-story, and even one-hundred-and-fifty-story skyscrapers, but there has never been a retro-style house built on top of trees, so they spread it as a joke.</p>
<h3 id="e256">Wardrobe Room in American Film Studios <a href="#e256" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c256" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">256</a></h3>
<p>— Zongwen</p>
<p>American film studios pay great attention to the wardrobe department. Because in recent years, they often make wordless plays that were popular in the past into films. The stories they tell mostly contain three eras: the first era is around 1860, the second era is around 1885, and the third era is the present day. To prepare the costumes for these three eras, one must pay special attention to it, and carefully study which era is which kind of costume with an artistic eye, without the slightest confusion. Therefore, some film studios have several wardrobe rooms with different eras, often storing thousands of different clothes. However, the women who manage the costumes must have graduated from art school, and also have experience on stage and in film performances. If clothing from 1860 is needed at a certain time, she will immediately have that type of clothing. In addition to the women who manage the clothes in the clothing department, there are also many seamstresses who specialize in making various modern clothes, as well as imitating many clothes that were popular in ancient times.</p>
<h3 id="e257">Soviet Sound Films Coming to Shanghai <a href="#e257" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c257" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">257</a></h3>
<p>— Shi</p>
<p>Shanghai people will soon have the opportunity to watch precious Soviet film art. This film was produced by the Soviet film trust "Intorgkino". Introductions to the two films "Two Meetings" and "Road to Life" have already been published in the newspapers. The basic value of Soviet films lies in the selection of themes. Soviet films mostly draw materials from the actual daily lives of the masses and their adherence to objective facts. Ulinov's "Two Meetings" is a representative work of Soviet sound films, with both material and technology reaching a superior level. The musical classics composed by Blok added a lot of artistic strength to the film. Like "Road to Life", this film is warmly welcomed everywhere it is screened. "Road to Life" was the first Soviet sound film to be screened in China. When the film opened in Harbin last January, the total number of viewers exceeded 32,000 in one week. This film became the most popular film in Harbin. There are also several other Soviet sound films that have already been screened in northern China and will soon be screened in Shanghai, such as "Gold Mountain", "The Mechanical Traitor", "Quiet Don", "Don Pais Symphony", "House of the Dead", "Gamiluck", and "Quietly Alone".

<h3 id="e258">Facial Expressions Difficult on the Screen <a href="#e258" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c258" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">258</a></h3>
<p>— Huaming</p>
<p>The directors of Hollywood pay close attention to the every move of the actors, because every actor has a habitual action and unnatural expression, which are often revealed unintentionally. When the director encounters this situation, he immediately corrects it, and sometimes even scolds them face-to-face, never ignoring it.</p>
<p>Norma Shearer has a talk about this. She said: "Almost everyone has habitual actions, which they don't feel themselves, but others find very annoying. My worst habitual action is often turning my head back. At first, I didn't feel anything, and some people said that this posture of mine was very beautiful. Later, I turned my head back non-stop, and I myself felt very ugly. From then on, every time I wanted to turn my head back, I immediately stopped myself, and this bad habit gradually disappeared."</p>
<p>The most difficult expression is smiling. Norma's chuckles and giggles in the film The Divorcee are completely natural and not forced at all. This is because she practiced hard, so to perform an expression, she can do whatever she wants. Frank Borzage, the director of Seventh Heaven, said: "I pay the most attention to the natural and calm expression. Whenever there is a forced movement, I will reform it. The actors who perform with me have the same view as me, so the films I direct do not have cramped expressions."</p>
<p>Now, let's briefly record the habitual actions of several stars:</p>
<p>RKO's new female star, Katharine Hepburn, often tightens her lips, making her lips wrinkled.</p>
<p>Glenda Farrell likes to raise her hand and put her little finger on her teeth, and she raised it three times in one scene in the film I Am a Fugitive.</p>
<p>Constance Bennett always raises her hand to touch her hair in every play, as if she feels that her hair is messy, and she must touch it before she feels at ease.</p>
<p>Mary Pickford's bad habit is often pouting her lips, but she hasn't been seen pouting her lips for a long time.</p>
<p>Myrna Loy's squint in the two films "Rescue Girl" and "Emma Hates History" is that she should have this expression in these two films, but she squints too much, so it is inevitable that it feels tasteless.</p>
<p>Joan Crawford always lowers her head before looking at a person, but she has now changed it.</p>
<p>Irene Dunne's breathing becomes rapid before she opens her mouth to speak.</p>
<p>Marion Davies often blinks her eyes when filming.</p>
<p>The above are all innate habits, which are not easy to change for a while, but must be changed.</p>
<h3 id="e259">The Story of the "Match King" ⑽㈠ <a href="#e259" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c259" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">259</a></h3>
<p>— Translated by Ximeng</p>
<p>After a while, the long-distance call was connected.</p>
<p>"Hello, hello," Eric shouted loudly. "Yes, I'm Eric, eh, Paul, the loan from Barclays Bank!"</p>
<p>Before he could finish speaking, Paul interrupted:</p>
<p>"Eric, write it down, this is extremely important. Quickly find out which place near the North Sea produces the best Periwinkles. Once you find it, use ice and hire a plane to send it here. I must have it by noon tomorrow. What?" He obviously heard that Eric wanted to report on many official matters and was a little impatient. "You can arrange it as you like, don't be busy, don't worry, I will find a way. Goodbye."</p>
<p>"But, Paul! Barclays!" Eric's face turned green with anxiety, but the phone on the other side had already hung up. He said to the many people around him who were stunned, "He hung up the phone."</p>
<p>He had no other choice but to reschedule the board meeting. He hurriedly hired a plane to prepare to go to Salzburg himself. But he didn't dare to disobey Paul's order, so he first had to find Periwinkles.</p>
<p>Eric flew to Salzburg tomorrow afternoon with the Periwinkles found in the North Sea, and tried his best to talk to Paul about serious business. Finally, Paul agreed to return to Stockholm with Eric.</p>
<p>"We don't need to say goodbye," Paul said to Mouna! She came to the airfield to see him off in person. "I'll be back here on Tuesday, and then we'll "go to Mirabell.""</p>
<p>"Mirabell! Tuesday," Mouna nodded carefully. "I'll wait for you, will you really come back?"</p>
<p>"What in the world can hold me back?" Paul whispered to Mouna.</p>
<p>"My dear!" Mouna said softly. "I'll wait until Tuesday, thank you, thank you for the Periwinkles, thank you for everything, you're really lovely."</p>
<p>But on Tuesday, Mouna waited for Paul to come, but he didn't come, and she sat alone in the bedroom, listless.</p>
<p>The board meetings were endless, and all kinds of important matters had to be handled by Paul Kruger himself with his superior intelligence and cunning, and others could not do it. But in the end, he actually borrowed a surprising amount of money from the Swedish National Bank. He went to the office and showed the loan contract to Eric.</p>
<p>"Isn't this the loan from Barclays Bank settled," he said, then slumped back in his chair. "My power can save Germany, and it can save France, I can save Europe, and other continents, but!" As he said this, his eyes stared at Mouna's beautiful photo. "I can't save myself!" His thoughts were obviously turning to Salzburg.</p>
