<h3>時評　我國農村問題之嚴重英</h3>
<p>數年以來。全國農村經濟。早已日趨於崩潰之境地。而近日形勢。更爲嚴重。試就昨日本埠報載之實例觀之。如上月下旬常熟縣恢復追租處。因此業主請求准向佃農追繳欠租者。日達數十件。則農村之困乏可想。此一事也。湖州在十餘年以前。每年産綢總額約八十萬疋。近年生産一蹶不振。現以閩變。廠家全部停歇。此又以一事也。夫江浙爲吾國精華薈萃之地。農村經濟。向稱富裕。以有米繭之生産也。乃自外國經濟勢力加緊侵入以來。吾國數千年自給自足之農村。即呈日趨危殆之象。全國農民竟至謀生無術。江浙富庶之地。尚且中是。此誠目前極堪注意之現象也。</p>
<p>試先就農村衰落之影響言之。吾國農村之地位。爲全國經濟之瑼心。佔人口總數百分之八十。繁榮與否。購買能力之消長繫焉。今蠶桑衰敗。米價跌落。農村中之生産者。除開支納租之外。所獲固不敷温飽。即擁有地産之業主。因農産物價跌落。（即租收之物所值日賤）地價亦有低賤之虞。因此造成農村經濟之恐慌。而都市工商。亦難謀發達。蓋二者之間。固有休戚與共之勢。此其影響之一端也。農村旣爲全國經濟之中心。則國家財政之基礎。亦與農村之榮枯有密切關係。田賦在國民政府成立以前。爲中央重要收入。而近年則爲地方財政之基礎。總計全國收入總額。當不下二萬萬元。倘如近時物價之低賤。農民欠租。業主欠賦。則地方財政。恐將發生動摇。故繁榮農村之目。亦即爲挽救財政危機之必然方法。此影響之又一端也。</p>
<p>就上述之情勢而言。目前中國經濟問題之中心。實在乎如何發動中國之農村。使生産繼續向上。換言之。即農民如何能安心盡力於地利。以增加生産之謂。農民能增加生産。然後都市工商業始有發展之危望。地方財政始有解决之途徑。顧發動中國之農村生産。其術果何如耶。目前最時髦之議論。當無過於改進農業金融之一説。蓋以爲農民之困難。由於缺乏生産資金。然當此全國經濟陷於恐慌之時。農民能否力足以利用都市之金融資本乃。一極無把握之事。如無此種能力。則現時生産之破壞。仍無復興之可能。面所謂農業金融改良之方法爲不足恃矣。</p>
<p>抑吾人又嘗聞所謂分田之策矣。蓋所謂分田云者。欲藉地權形式之變更。以爲解决中國農村恐慌之出路耳。然其實中國經濟恐慌至於今日。其中心問題。全繫於農民經濟之不安定。今欲謀正當解决之途徑。第一須先使農民目前得到救濟之實利。暫維現狀。即謂分田之策。亦爲安定農民經濟之道。然如何而能分配。使農民取得自由使用之土地。其問題繁重。絶非短少時間所能解决。則此方法。又寗足以濟目前農村之急耶。然則解救農村經濟之道。究將安由。誠爲當今最堪研究之問題也。</p>

<h3>本市新聞　財部訓令各海關　明日開徴洋米麥税　閩桂粤三省暫緩徴收</h3>
<p>麵粉業昨開緊急會議申時社本埠訊、中央爲救濟農民困苦、復興農村經濟起見、已訓令全國各海關、（除閩粤桂外）自十六日起、一律實地徴收米麥進口税、申時社記者、茲從財致界方面、覓得財部訓令全文、及徴税後各方情形、爰再續誌如次、</p>
<h3>財政部兩訓令原文</h3>
<p>（一）財部爲征收米榖進口税訓令江海關監督及税務司文云、案查本部前以全國各團體紛紛請求征收洋米進口税、保護農民生計、救濟農村經濟等情、經本部查核、尚屬可行、已呈由行政院、轉送立法院審議、規定外米每担最高税率二·五○金單位、榖一·五○金單位、由本部再行斟酌另定征收細則、詳擬具復、茲經本部議定征收洋米每担一·○○金單位榖每担·五○金單位、通令全國海關、一律征收、至粤海·潮海·瓊海·梧州·龍州·南寗·厦門·閩海·等關、進口之米榖、因各該地民食關係、目前豐予緩行、其餘各省之海關、自本年十二月十六日起報有進口米榖、應即遵照所訂税率、實行征税、其由上述未施行征税區域、轉運來滬之進口米榖、亦應於到達口岸時、一律照征進口税、除分令並咨呈外、合行令仰遵照、此令、（二）財政部爲征收洋麥麵粉雜糧進口税、訓令江海關監督及税務司文云、案查征收洋麥麵粉雜糧進口税一案、本部前奉行政院令知、已經立法院議决、海關進口洋麥征收關税、麵粉應增加關税、其税率酌量伸縮、洋麥每担、（舊制百斤合關衡六○五公斤）最高征收一·二五金單位、最低至免税、麵粉每担最高征收二·五○金單位、最低至免税、務乞從速擬具税率、呈核施行等因、遵經由部參酌麥與麵粉之躉售價格、就兩項相互間應具之比例、按照立法院議决之税率範圍、規定進口小麥、每担征收進口税○·三○金單位、麵粉每担征收進口税○·七五金單位、此外進口之大麥·蕎麥、玉蜀黍·小米·裸麥·及其他雜糧、應一律按從價百分之十征收、均於本月十六日起、一律照征、除分令及咨呈外、合行令仰遵照、此令、</p>
<h3>米榖徴税市價趨高</h3>
<p>徴收進口税以後、預期市價可望趨高、農村經濟得以活潑、但據記者向各方調查、一時或不致有甚大變動、其原因、（一）榖徴税、喧傳已久、一般熟知此中情形者、均以爲徴税雖未能即時實現、但亦僅爲時間問題、因而資本雄厚之米商、預先已大批囤積、期望徴税後、可獲厚利、但消費方面、仍屬如故、一時不能居奇、據申時神記者調查、本市所存秈米、約在十萬擔左右、本米在二十萬擔以上、足夠一個月之消費、故最近數旬之米價、可不致有何影響、（二）内地米榖囤積尚多、隨時可以大批採辦、以平市價、據一般觀察、在明年三四月以後、或尚有較烈之變動、但市價果高於洋米價值時、則外米又可入口、而使價格再趨於平疲、如此原原相因、市價即可持平穏定也、</p>
<h3>麵粉廠業緊急會議</h3>
<p>此項征税值接受影響者、爲本埠麵粉同業、如阜豐·福新·信大·等、前向美國訂購美麥、已有十一般之多、每船以七千五百噸計、合共八萬二千五百噸、現規定每擔徴收小麥進口税○·三○金單位、（約合國幣五角六七分）其税金約在八十萬元左右、當此營業衰落期間、何能再勝如許負擔、自昨日江海關公佈税率後、麵粉廠同業公會、即於昨日下午四時、在新開河該會會所、召集緊急會議、到各廠家代表十餘人、一致决議函請市商會、轉呈行政院·財政部·税務署·關務署、請將洋麥進口税率公佈以前、各廠直接已定未到之洋麥、一律免予征税、以維粉業、</p>
<h3>米麥征税國税增收</h3>
<p>征税以後、對於國税、當有相當增收、但洋米税率、每石（以百五十斤計）約在國幣三元左右、小麥粉每石約征國幣一元四角、與國産差額甚巨、此後自難進口、意在保護國内農工、目的自不在税收、惟小麥爲各廠家必須之原料、國産小麥、僅足維持四個月、其餘均須仰賴外麥之接濟、以去年情形而論、進口小麥、在一千五百萬擔、約值銀四千萬三百萬以上、以每擔征國幣五角計、當可增加收入七百五十萬元以上、</p>
<h3>閩粤桂暫從緩</h3>
<p>申時社記者昨已探悉閩粤桂三省進口米榖免征、爲確實之事、今觀財部訓令全文、粤海·潮海·瓊海·梧州·龍州·南寗·厦門·閩海·等各海關、暫予緩征、是上説已成事實、一般人因此懸揣、或與目下之時局有關、但據記者調查、此項推想、完全錯誤、三省除外、似有其他不得已之原因、至必要時、仍將隨時命令征收、與時局并無絲毫關係、且閩粤二省事實上已征統税、照目下洋米市價、恐亦不能暢通云、</p>

<h3>赴閩　外輪取消檢查</h3>
<p>食糧亦可裝往中央爲封鎖閩海、先禁華輪在福州海埠停靠、復又派海軍駐三都澳、搜查洋商輪、曾迭誌本報、本報記者茲得確訊、搜查外輪事、已經停止、而糧食運閩、亦可裝往矣、</p>
<h3>停止搜查</h3>
<p>上月英商怡和洋行恒生輪、從香港到福州、再來上海、當進出口時、海軍逸仙艦、均派官兵上輪、嚴行檢查、旅客與貨件、盡行抄騐、此事發生後、怡和當局、電駐京英領、與我外部、會商停止搜查辦法、英商亦保證决不裝載軍械等項、運入福州、但同時要求駐閩海口海軍各艦、勿再搜檢、以免延誤海程、與驚擾旅客、中央對英領要求、已經容納、刻已轉知三都澳各軍艦、即日終止搜查外輪矣、</p>
<h3>往來無阻</h3>
<p>捷升輪船、上次由閩來滬、及從上海赴閩、即可自由行駛、海軍未予檢查、閩海口亦無阻碍、故往來自如、唯因華輪全部停航、閩帮貨件、照常運裝、故捷升輪進出口貨、驟然增多、來去均滿儎乘客更多、公司與買辦、均獲巨利、</p>
<h3>糧食可往</h3>
<p>中央曾有命令、在禁止華輪駛閩、斷其水面交通外、更不准裝運糧食赴閩、接濟軍食、惟閩中人民、向來需要糧食、多由上海運去、今一旦斷運、則民食將發生恐慌、故江海關並未頒布食糧不准運閩禁令、上星期二、福州帮在滬購辦之大宗白米與麫粉、共有二千數百噸、已經裝去、昨得電告、已安然至福州、刻在起卸中、</p>

<h3>旗和歌</h3>
<p>— 孟珍</p>
<p>中國什麽都是矛盾的，什麽多是畸形的。以農立國的國家農村破産了，從始至終在金融的社會中幣制不統一的。其他呢？我來舉一個例，就是旗和歌。</p>
<p>中華民國成立以來的旗，眞層出不窮</p>
<p>：　　辛亥革命以後，我們的國旗制定爲（紅黄藍白黑）的五色旗。　軍旗是星旗，青天白日爲海軍旗。</p>
<p>後來袁世凱洪憲盜國，制定（斜紅十字）爲中心，十字的四面爲（黄藍白黑小三角）爲國旗。</p>
<p>張勳復辟復用清朝龍旗。</p>
<p>北伐以前的軍閥用古代的將軍旗。</p>
<p>北伐之後，改用（青天白日滿地紅）爲國旗，青天白日爲黨旗。</p>
<p>至於僞滿定（紅藍白黑的短横條）代我青天白日，（滿天黄）代滿地紅的國旗。</p>
<p>最近　省又定（上藍下紅中嵌五角黄星）的旗。</p>
<p>今年民國生産了二十二年，旗却有了十面這是一件值得驚駭的事。</p>
<p>國旗爲一國規定的旗章，所以爲一國之標識者，可見國旗是多麽的重要！有五千年歷史的國家而對於這極重要的國旗，在數十年中竟有這樣大變遷。</p>
<p>並且，現在我們偉大的青天白日滿地紅旗，在商店中給他們掛着作招牌；在工人的家中，給他們釘在窗洞上；帆船把它們當了帆。</p>
<p>至於國歌呢，我們曾有卿雲歌；但近這十年來，却没有一隻代表國家體面的國歌</p>
<p>。　　中國現在不强，也許因爲國旗國歌在作怪，等候將來有一天，國旗受全國人尊敬，不再輕易産生了；國歌也正式的産生了，那末中國也許可强盛起來，不能勝列强，也得並駕齊驅。</p>
<h3>品性從食物中來</h3>
<p>— 珮瑜</p>
<p>有人説蘇州城裏的人，因爲從小喝了市河裏的齷齪水，所以説起話來，軟熟非凡，流利異常。吳儂軟語是從喝齷齪水所養成的。這句話確切與否，不得而知，不過根據了最新的原理，很容易説明一個人的品性是從他所吃的東西中來的。那麽，（品性從食物中來）的一句話，比（方言因飲水而有别）的一句話，來得靠得住些；因爲有人對於品性與食物有無相當關係，曾經加以一番深切的研究。這種新科學的主要解釋者，名安司金，在他所著的一本小册子名Borology中，供給我們許多種種不同的例證。</p>
<p>例如這種體質强健，秉性靜默一類的人，始終如一地選擇大塊肉和不易消化的食物來吃。那些喜歡多量調味物（如鹽醋香料等）的人，是易受刺激，容易發怒的，這是很通常的。喜吃麵食糕餅發怒的，這是很通常的。喜吃麵食糕餅一類東西的人，大都不會是這釋多情善感的感情主義者。從健康與衛生方面看起來，我們知道蔬菜是良好的食品，但是關於蘿蔔却不能下不一句忠告；每餐多吃了蘿蔔，容易使性情兇暴殘忍的。</p>
<p>從别個權威者的著作中，我們還可以收集到不少的解釋與例證。例如説吃水菓的人，性情常是温和的；因爲水菓是集中多量日光的。這是可以相信的，人們漸有喜歡多吃水菓與蔬菜的趨勢；因爲現代生活驅使人們集中於嚥起來比較快些的食品。一切新鮮的食品，都有刺戟性與興奮性的，適如茶與酒等。因此，對於飲食十分小心，萬分謹愼，非但可以避免疾病，並且可以增進健康，改變性情咧。</p>
<h3>同是外國人</h3>
<p>— 冠英</p>
<p>每離開工作的處所，照例就趕回囚籠式的屋内，往床上一躺，什麽都不管，今天是特别高興，不肯急急回去，向那馬路上亂兜，想藉此透出一口悶氣。不巧得根接連地看到兩樁不平的事，引起我心中無限的波瀾。</p>
<p>經過夜市通明的南京路，轉向冷靜幽寂的街頭。忽地斜刺裏衝出一羣人，兩個羅松的異國流浪者抱頭鼠竄向這邊奔逃，後面却緊緊跟着兩個中國苦力死命地狂追着，邊走邊駡：（混蛋的羅松傳三…）（趕上我打死你…）那兩個羅松人並不肯示弱，回轉頭來厮打着，猶有抵抗的雄心，這時苦力方面又加入幾個生力軍，羅松人看看不支了。頭部與背上早着了無數拳頭，他們不得不拔脚急奔，幾個苦力仍不捨的急追上去，看熱閙的人狂呼歡笑着。聽他們的紛亂談話。有的説：（羅松癟三眞討厭，該打！）有的説：（他們在上海没有人保護，打死也没有人問）在這煩雜的輿論中，我彷彿看見兩個異國流浪者又被揪着挨打了</p>
<p>很無聊的越過蘇州河，向我住所走去。穿過酒綠燈紅約跳舞場，咖啡店，走向那荒冷寥落的一隅。刺骨的寒風拍面吹來，禁不住瑟瑟地發抖，猛的聽到一聲姜厲的呼號自前面傳來，我急忙的趕去，遠遠望見一大堆人和十幾個黄包車夫圍在一個弄堂的門口，一個外國水兵揚長地向弄裏走去，聽他們的談説，原來是剛才那個吃醉酒的花旗兵毆打這個正在哭訴着的車夫，那個花旗兵酒吃得爛醉，也不給車錢跳下事就走，車夫在後面追討，給果是吃了他幾脚皮鞋和幾記耳光，車夫痛極了，可憐他在上海對於洋人勢力積習已久，所以只有呼號，没有反抗，雖然旁邊站了許多人和十幾個同伴，大家也只好面面相覷，不敢作一些不平的共鳴，儘有的當作瞧熱閙在觀看，　　在歸途中，我心頭湧起無限的感慨，跟前不斷地晃着兩種不司的異國人物</p>
<h3>東北四連長</h3>
<p>— 張恨水</p>
<p>第二十回　卜吉有期老人連日笑　剷愁不盡舊雨對門居</p>
<p>江氏看到這樣子，他已是非寫不可，索興向他凑趣着道：我這邊是没有什麽客的，老太爺是人情多，您自己估量着吧？要辦多少桌酒席呢？酒席是多少錢一桌的合適呢？他接連的説出兩個問題，這又引起了趙翁的興致了，應當如何下請帖？酒如何招待？酒席要用那一等的，才覺過得去？這一撥動了他説話的機組，竟是滔滔説個不絶。江氏吃過了午飯，十二點鐘就來了，一直談到下午四點鐘，趙翁還是精神抖擻的主意層出不窮。後來還是老太爺的聽差小林進來説，大姑娘在屋子裏呌着呢。江氏想到自己姑娘，身體有些不舒服，也許今天下午又躺着了，我怎好把他丢了大半天不去過問呢，於是就借了這個原故，躱開趙翁的話鋒了。趙翁居然盼到兒子要娶媳婦了，這實在是大大的一喜，那裏肯擺脱開了不想，一個人出着神，想這樣想那樣，又記上了許多。白天籌畫了一天不算，到了晚上，一個人坐在燈下，又慢慢的寫了好幾封信。每封信上。都有在旁邊打着雙圈的句子。例如（信到之日，我兒即預備一切，由兒自定日期，何時可以請假，即刻函告余知，余自按兒到家之時，先期辦理。以便兒到，便作喜事。）又如（小兒不日即將完婚，需欵甚急，所有弟存欵二百餘元，請即日彚齊，弟不日入城親來携取。）又如（欵項不敷尚鉅，仍乞我兄早日爲之設法，以應燃眉之急，毋任感盼。）這老人作事，旣然是異常週到，而且還談個敏捷，次日起早，他親自就用掛號信，將它寄出去了。寄了信回來，走到前面院子裏，隔了窗户就向屋子呌了一聲道：楊老太，在家嗎？（二六八）</p>
<h3>侵佔與拆讓</h3>
<p>— 僵</p>
<p>滄海變做桑田，桑田變成滄海；一片荒地，變做了崇樓大厦的十里洋塲。在這努力建設的現在，都市裏面因着擴展街道，許多有碾交通的民房，一一拆讓，尤其是幾條熱閙街衢，因着街道擴展得大，房屋就讓進得多，有幾處市屋，簡實收縮得壁櫉一般，幢幢地列在那裏。</p>
<p>因着街道的擴展，房屋的收縮，顯就出了地皮的可貴。於是以前的荒地，高墩，一刹那，都變做了華樓傑閣。那一班有力的人，更把那些無主的公地，獗窄的官弄，逐漸的化公爲私，變做了私人的産業。</p>
<p>因着侵佔公地的人，大都是有産階級，於是一班考古家，就履行他們保古的宏志，在那陳舊的××府志，或地圖裏面，搜尋古跡，出來保障。於是××侵佔公地，××侵佔官弄的新聞，不時在報紙發現</p>
<p>可是保古的盡力保古，侵佔的兀自侵佔，荒僻的公地，無用的官弄，也像上海的洋塲一般，逐漸地變做　了華厦，崇樓。那侵佔的新聞，起頭時雖轟轟烈烈，驚世駭俗，但五分鐘一過，早像抵貨一般，都已無聲無臭。據説一般考古者流，却在那呐喊聲中，從那陳紙堆裏，覓到了黄金之粟。</p>
<p>拆讓的拆讓，侵佔的侵佔，在這滄海桑田，大起變化的當兒；被拆的，憂愁固是這般憂愁，可是侵佔的，快活却也儘足快活。尤其是那一班考古家，更有事可爲，有利可圖，大幹其名利雙收的保古事業。這大約是古文明國的唯一的特徴，在這努力建設的現代。</p>

<h3>兒時</h3>
<p>— 子明</p>
<p>狂臚文獻耗中年，亦是今生後起緣；猛憶兒時心力異：一燈紅接混茫前。－定庵詩。</p>
<p>生命没有寄託的人，青年時代和（兒時）對他格外寳貴。這種浪漫諦克的回憶其實並不是發現了（兒時）的眞正了不得，而是感覺到（中年）以後的退。本來，生命祇有一次，對於誰都是寳貴的。但是，假使他的生命溶化在大衆的裏面，假使他天天性在爲這世界幹些什麽，那麽，他總在生長，雖然衰老病死仍舊是逃避不了，然而他的事業——大衆的事業是不死的。他會領略到（永久的青年）。而（浮生如夢）的人，從這世界裏拿去的很多，而給這世界的却很少——他總有一天會覺得疲乏的死亡：他連拿都没有力量了。衰老和無能的悲哀，像鉛一樣的沉重，壓在他的心頭。青春是多麽短呵！</p>
<p>（兒時）的可愛是無知。那時候，件件都是（知），你每天可以做大科學家和大哲學家，每天在發見什麽新的現象，新的眞理。現在呢？（什麽）都已經知道了，熟悉了，每一個人的臉都已經看厭了。宇宙和社會是那麽陳舊，無味，雖則牠們其實比（兒時）新鮮得多了。我於是想念（兒時），禱告（兒時）。</p>
<p>不能夠前進的時候，就願意退後幾步，替自己恢復已經走過的前途。請求（無知）回來，給我求知的快樂。可怕呵，這生命的（停止）。</p>
<p>過去的始終過去了，未來的還是未來。究竟感慨些什麽——我問自己。</p>
<h3>秋天的况味</h3>
<p>— 林語堂</p>
<p>秋天的黄昏，一人獨坐在沙法上抽烟，看烟頭白灰之下露出紅光，微微透露出暖氣，心頭的情緒便跟着那藍烟繚繞而上，一樣的輕鬆，一樣的自由。不轉眼繚烟變成縷縷的細絲，慢慢不見了，而那霎時，心上的情緒也跟着消沉於大千世界。所以也不講那時的情緒，而只講那時的情緒的况味。待要再劃一根洋火，再點起那已點過三四次的雪茄，却因白灰已積得大金，點不着，乃輕輕的一彈，烟灰靜悄悄的落在銅罏上，其靜寂如同我此時用毛筆寫在中紙上一樣，一點的聲息也没有。於是再點起來，一口一口的吞雲吐霧，香氣撲鼻，宛如偎紅倚翠温香在抱情調。於是想到烟，想到這烟一股温煦的熱氣，想到室中繚繞暗淡的烟霞，想到秋天的意味。這時才憶起，向來詩文上秋的含義，並不是這樣的，使人聨想的是肅殺，是凄凉，是秋扇，是紅葉，是荒林，是萋草。然而秋確有另一意味，没有春天的陽氣勃勃，也没有夏天的火烈迫人，也不像冬天之全入於枯稿凋零。我所愛的是秋林古氣磅磚氣象。有人以老氣横秋駡人，可見是不懂得秋林古色之滋味。在四時中，我於秋是有偏愛的，所以不妨説説。秋是代表成熟，對於春天之明媚嬌艷，夏日之茂密濃深，都是過來人，不足爲奇了，所以其色淡，葉多黄，有古色蒼蘢之慨，不單以葱翠爭榮了。這是我所謂秋天的意味。大槪我所愛的不是晚秋，是初秋，那時暄氣初消，月正圓，蟹正肥，桂花皎潔，也未陷入懍烈蕭瑟氣態，這是最值得賞樂的。那時的温和，如我烟上的紅灰，只是一股熏熟的温香罷了。或如文人已排脱下筆驚人的格調，而漸趨純熟煉達，宏毅堅實，其文讀來有深長意味。這就是莊子所謂（正得秋而萬寳成）結實的意義。在人生上最享樂的就是這一類的事。比如酒以醇以老爲佳。烟也有和烈之辦。雪茄之佳者，遠勝於香烟，因其氣味較和。倘是燒得得法，慢慢的吸完一枝，看那紅光炙發，有無窮的意味。鴉片吾不知，然看見人在烟燈上燒，聽那微微嗶剝的聲音，也覺得有一種詩意。大槪凡是古老，純熟，熏黄，熟煉的事物，都使我得到同樣的愉快。如一隻熏黑的陶鍋在烘爐上用慢火　豬肉時所發出的鍋中徐吟的聲調，是使我感到同觀人燒大烟一樣的興趣。或如一本用過二十年而尚未破爛的字典，或是一張用了半世的書桌，或如看見街上一塊熏黑了老氣横秋的招牌，或是看見書法大家蒼勁雄深的筆跡，都令人有相同的快樂。人生世上如歲月之有四時，必須要經過這純熟時期，如女人發育健全遭過安順的，亦必有一時徐娘半老的風韻，爲二八佳人所絶不可及者。使我最佩服的是鄧肯的佳句；）世人只會吟咏春天與戀愛，眞無道理。須知秋天的景色，亞華麗，更恢奇，而秋天的快樂有萬倍的雄壯，驚奇，都麗。我眞可憐那些婦女識見徧狹，使她們錯過愛之秋天的宏大的贈賜。）若鄧肯者，可謂識趣之人。</p>
<h3>彌留</h3>
<p>— 何家槐</p>
<p>晚上。</p>
<p>小姨母的頭腫得像斗桶一樣粗大；眼睛也只剩得一線了；臉色由青變成黑；有許多像瘡疤一樣閃光的斑點：𩓐子腫得像吃飽了榖的鵝頸，簡直不能轉動；那個不斷地流着血膿的瘡，同她的嘴巴，一齊噴出難聞的臭氣。</p>
<p>外祖母跪在她的旁邊，全家大小都圍着她們，恐怖地聽着她的囈語：</p>
<p>（哦哦哦……一個兵，他一定要我跟着他走，那個惡棍……你們看，他不是就站在我的面前嗎？……）</p>
<p>用着顫抖的手，她痙攣地指着站在她面前的外祖父。</p>
<p>（是我呀，小梅，怎麽連我也不認識了？）</p>
<p>聽到這聲音，她睜大眼睛，彷彿找尋什麽人似的。其實那雙眼睛早已模糊了，那裏看得清什麽東西？她没有辨出站在她面前的就是外祖父，也没有聽到他的説話，因爲她還是繼續着亂説：　　（你眞好笑，這麽大的年紀，還是這樣不安定，在我脚後亂踢亂閙的，簡直把我舖得好好的被窩踢得不留一點熱氣了……）　　雖則全身用幾重絲棉被頭蓋着，她却抖得很厲害，似乎她的被窩眞的給人踢開了，使她感到澈骨的寒冷。</p>
<p>（你只要安心地睡一覺，馬上就會好了，不要想東想西的！）</p>
<p>凝視着小姨母的臉孔，外祖母含着涙説。平日她是最愛清潔，最不肯親近病人，簡直一見麻瘋爛脚就會逃走的一類婦人。可是在這小姨母瀕危的幾個鐘頭以内，她没有一刻離開這張爛腫的，不成形的嘴臉。</p>
<p>（甘醫生來過没有？）</p>
<p>小姨母忽然很清醒的問。</p>
<p>（在樓下吃飯，他説你只要靜養幾天，就會走路了。）</p>
<p>（眞的嗎？）</p>
<p>（自然是眞的，誰騙你呢？）</p>
<p>外祖母像騙小孩子似的騙着，眼眶里滿是眼涙。小姨母的臉上雖則腫得紫黑，聽了這些話，却很快的透出亮光，那些斑點尤其閃爍得明顯，兩條細眼也彷彿在不住地微笑。然望似乎還在她的心裏激動，也許那個長指甲長鬍子的老醫生，在這千鈞一髮的時候還是她的救星；她自己這樣想，别的人雖則知道醫生已經拒絶診治了，可是也像她一樣的希望着。</p>
<p>（媽，我想我會馬上走路的，我要小便……）</p>
<p>像驟然間得到力量，她在枕上摇着那個斗桶般的頭，想豎起身來，説要走到放尿桶的角落去，試試她自己能否走路。所有的人都阻止她，呌她不要起身，因爲尿桶是可以移動的。但她堅决地不肯，掙扎着，懇求着，一定要外祖母扶她。</p>
<p>（我已經會走，我已經會走…那個兵…）</p>
<p>可是剛豎起了身，彷彿就給壓倒似的，她又頽然地倒了下來。她那個斗桶似的頭，硬直而且可怕地歪在一邊；血像水似的噴出瘡口，發出一股逼人的臭氣；那雙死魚一樣的眼睛，跟着微弱下去的喘息，漸漸地閉了攏來。</p>
<p>（小梅！小梅！小梅……）</p>
<p>外祖母瘋狂似的喊着，可是再也聽不到一點回聲。她的血冷了，全家的血也跟着冷了，希望的凋零眞是迅速。</p>
<h3>文藝雜談</h3>
<p>— 夢原</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>周作人先生很有興味的從（笑府），（笑倒），（笑得好）三書裏挑選了許多笑話，編輯了一部（苦雨菴笑話選）。在書前長序的結尾説：</p>
<p>中國現時似乎盛行（幽默，）這不是什麽吉兆。帝俄時代一個文人説，諷刺是奴隸的言語，這話很有意思鄉民相遇，説某人（伽藍菩）了，雖與當舖錢店的伙計酒醉飯飽將頭比屁股爲戲彷彿相似，實際却有一個黑暗的背景。讓人民去談論，發洩他們的鳥氣，無論是眞的苦痛或是假的牢騷，這倒量一種太平氣象罷讀了這幾句話，我覺得周作人先生近來也有些不甘於寂寞了。本來，周先生是色變（談虎），其後，（虎入深山，久久不出），現在，這大虫是變成（笑面）的來和我們相見了，周先生其亦有不得已之苦衷乎？不過雖是（笑面），然而，似乎已不是當初的（虎），這終不免是一遺憾耳。</p>
<h3>兩兄弟（五九）</h3>
<p>— 莫泊桑著　李維克譯</p>
<p>她笑道：</p>
<p>（試試罷，你便看到它會怎樣的穿過你的蝦網逃去）。</p>
<p>（可是…假使你願意呢）？</p>
<p>（我願意看見你捕到一些海蝦…暫時再不願意你捕到别的什麽…）</p>
<p>（你壞透了。我們跑去再遠一點罷，這裏什麽都没有）。</p>
<p>他把手伸給她，扶着她在那滑膩的礁石上走。她小心翼翼地靠在他身上，而他便突然覺得自己被愛情佔領了，他的欲望愈熾，急於要獲得她，彷彿那在他身上萌芽着的病等着今天來開發似的。</p>
<p>他們一會兒便走到了一個比較深的凹地旁邊，在那顫慄着的，由一條看不見的裂縫向那遥遠的海流去的活水裏，浮動着一些長的，纖細的，有着奇奇怪怪的顔色的草，一些淡紅的綠的彷彿在游泳着的毛髮。</p>
<p>陸醉米太太呌道：</p>
<p>（看啦，看啦，我瞧見一隻蝦了，一隻大的，一隻狠大的，在那裏！）</p>
<p>他也跟着看見了，於是毅然地走進那洞裏，雖然水浸到腰身也不顧及了。</p>
<p>可是那小東西划動着牠的長鬚，在蝦網之前慢慢地往後退着。哲安把牠趕到海草那兒，以爲一定可以在那裏把牠捕到。當牠覺到被包圍了時，便突然一跳，從蝦網上溜去，穿過泥沼不見了。　　那聚精會神瞧着這種追逐的少婦忍不住呌道：</p>
<p>（啊！笨透了！）</p>
<p>他弄窘了，便糊里糊塗地把他的蝦網往一處長滿着草的水底一拖。拿出水面看時，他瞧見自己無意中在那看不見的蝦的隠伏處網來了三隻透明的大海蝦。</p>
<p>他得意洋洋地遞給陸太太，但她却不敢接過來，她害怕牠們那小小的頭上武裝着的尖鋭的齒形的刺。</p>
<p>但她終於决定去拿了，她用兩個指頭牛着牠們那細長的鬍鬚，把牠們一隻一隻地放進了背籃，夾着一點兒海藻，免得牠們死去。隨後找着一個比較淺的水窪時，她便怯生生地下去了，——因爲脚冷稍稍窒息着——她動手自己捕捉。她乖巧而又詭詐，她有着捕蝦所必需的輕捷的手腕和獵人的靈敏。差不多每次她都撈到一些被騙了的，因爲她那樣巧妙地緩緩地趕去以至來及不逃走的海蝦。</p>
<p>哲安現在一隻都捕不到，可是他一步一步地跟着她，和她擦來擦去，彎在她身上，假裝對於自己的笨拙感着異常絶望，想要跟她學習。</p>
<p>（啊！給我看見，）他説，（給我看看！）</p>
<p>隨後，當他們兩人的臉孔緊接着映在那異常清朗的，因爲池底有着黑色植物襯着成了一塊明鏡似的水裏，哲安對着他旁邊的從底下望着他的頭笑着，有時用指尖對她擲去一個彷彿落在那頭上的吻。</p>
<p>（啊！你多麽討厭！）那少婦説；（一個人决不要同時做兩宗事情喲。）</p>
<p>他回答道：</p>
<p>（我祗在做着一宗事情。我愛你。）</p>
<p>她抬起身子，以一種嚴肅的語調説：</p>
<p>（喂，這十分鐘以來你究竟怎樣了啊，你昏了頭嗎？）　　（不，我没有昏了頭。我愛你，我終於敢把這事告訴你。）</p>

<h3>糧食粉麥税無裨於目前粉市</h3>
<p>昨日粉市、上午開盤後、各月份市面、初平繼跌、以洋麥報價、芝加哥回跌四角零、坎拿大跌三角零、故初開時、市氣已不見佳、迨後因廠家方面、陸續脱手、業外多頭、亦因洋麥加税、業經公布、照税率等目下面相較、似無可再事利用、所以一部分曾有回出、市氣遂步步鬆動、較前日計落一二分不等、迫至下午開盤、初尚平疲、旋以本月份北帮略有動辦、因該處現銷尚佳、日約四萬包左右、故市氣尚穏、致遠期各月份、以現洋麥依然兜售不絶、白麥上午喊三元八角六分、下午喊三元八角八分、紅麥祇喊三元八角、廠家祗還七角、故無成交、照此情形、遠期恐少振動之力矣、結果本月份及一月份各跌二分、二月份跌一分半、三月份跌一分七厘半、四月份跌一分半、五月份跌一分七厘半云、</p>
<h3>洋麥仍各處兜售</h3>

<h3>洋米征税激動米市人心</h3>
<p>昨日客秈市况、因洋米徴税已見明令、市上人心甚佳、卽各産區亦多報漲、且有業内外囤户在各産區購辦囤存、産價報大、來源减少、滬上市價亦復喊大近角、惟進户尚在觀望中、故全日交易不多、行情則步砌、去化閩省居多計由厦門辦去湖南機油一百五十包、價七元六角、又機靖二百包、價七元三角三分、泉州辦去無錫機米一百五十包、價七元二角、寗波辦去蕪湖元米三百五十包、價七元八角二分至七元六角八分、本街與其他均無交易、</p>

<h3>五金青鉛開出三四百擔</h3>
<p>昨五金交易、依然清淡、惟獨青鉛買賣頗爲熱閙、故開出達三四百擔之多、其價每擔估十六元一角、比前小去一角、而購進者則多爲本街印書房如黄丹廠油漆公司等、緣因時局關係、多未採辦、客帮方面如天津漢口九江安慶諸帮、除有問津外、實際成交者殊屬不多、此外湖南土鉛近日交易亦屬有限、行情尚無變遷、計每擔爲十五元八角、</p>
<h3>銀價與中國物價水準之關係　（續）路易士張履鸞作</h3>
<p>到了一九三三年夏季、增高銀價之臨時恊定、方由美中秘魯印度等九國代表在英國倫敦簽字、假使此種恊定正式成立、（一）那末世界重要用銀國如中國印度與西班牙等在以後四年之内須不得出售其白銀總量超過一萬萬六千萬盎斯、（二）其他重要産銀國如墨西哥·秘魯·瑪利非亞·奥大利亞·加拿大·及美國·等在四年之内、亦應由各國政府或中央銀行收買一萬萬四千萬盎斯之新産白銀存庫、但根據一九二○至一九三二之十三年間、平均每年由以上各國中央銀行出售鎔銀之量而言、每年僅達四千一百五十萬盎斯、所以此種建議、頗可以表示以後必能增加相當的白銀需要、因爲兩者相抵以後、每年不過只有五百萬兩存銀增加而已、</p>
<p>採用白銀爲貨幣的聲浪、現在墨西哥美國以及南美洲諸邦、頗爲高漲、單就一般社會輿論而言、趨向此種建議的人亦殊不少、</p>
<p>總之將來卽使有不用白銀做貨幣的政策、但如欲其牽制白銀購買力之下降、與中國物價水準提高、其效力恐至微、　　就長時期而論、根據山特教授的（Carl　Snyder）研究、吾人知道在白銀購買力降低的時候、世界上存銀量之指數、每遠在世界主要原料品數量指數之後、從一八四至一九一四年中、世界上商品産額增加、每年約爲百分之三·一五、在歐洲大戰時、因戰事影響、世界原料品産額、突然降低、戰事過後、其週常增加率行將恢復、不幸又遭一九二九年世界經濟不景氣的挫折、原料商品産額、又行减低了、</p>
<p>使世界各國漸漸渡過此不景氣的難開、通常的原料商品産額每年增加率、或可仍然恢復果欲仍使白銀維持其固有穏定的購買力、那末白銀做貨幣的數量、要仍然不變、每年額的增加率、至少亦應爲百分之三·一五、方爲合理、但根據一九三二年的估計、每年白銀的産量需要約有四萬萬七千九百萬盎斯、而在一九二九年的産量、雖已打破歷年的約錄、其實則産額亦僅有二萬萬六千零九十萬盎斯、一九三二年白銀的産額、據估計亦僅爲一萬萬五千萬盎斯、由此觀之、吾人假定日後各國不採用白銀做貨幣以後、卽以現在之白銀産額面論、亦不見能每年增加三倍、與貨物之增加率齊驅、以牽制現在白銀購買力指數之不再增高也、</p>
<p>（三）增高銀之購買力可使中商業衰落　　主張利用白銀爲貨幣的人們、常信增高銀之購買力、在世界市場上、可使中國整個國家的購買力增高、但是搜集各種證據、他的結果都却與之相反、（未完）</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>取締以後</h3>
<p>— 曲辰</p>
<p>記曰：（移風易俗，莫善於樂。）音樂的能陶冶人性情，是在任何藝術之上。因爲萬籟天成，心所共感。不若繪畫彫刻等等尚須具有種種素養，才能領略其中趣味。故音樂爲最普遍的藝術，無形之美，莫美於音樂。</p>
<p>古人又云：（言爲心聲。）故音樂不獨是一種藝術品，尤爲國民性由衷的表示。國民性剛强進取的國家，流行的音樂，多屬發揚激勵的，我們聽到（馬賽革命歌），彷彿看見法國大革命時，一般民衆熱烈的情緒，同樣聽到（伏爾加船夫曲），我們就可想到斯拉夫民族沉着邁進的精神。國民性舒緩散漫的國家，歌曲也多挨聲歎氣，没精打彩的。如我國現代所流行的（我愛你……）（睡覺了……）一類的歌曲是。故古代的人聞歌詩而能知各國的國情，這决不是無稽之談。</p>
<p>唐御史大夫杜淹曰：（齊之將，作伴侶曲；陳之將亡，作玉村海庭花，其聲哀思，行路聞之皆悲泣。）現在的（毛毛雨）（催眼曲）等總不見得在（伴侶曲）與（後庭花）之下吧，齊陳時候的情形，與現在的也有點相像，想到杜淹的話，令人不寒而慄。</p>
<p>我也不知是否我的耳器官有異於人，對於現下所流行的一般歌曲，聽到就嘔心，總像頭上澆了一桶冷水那樣要汗毛爲之站班。但近來我的隣居新裝了一架無線電收音機，（賣花呀！……）（睡覺了……）那一類的歌詞，沾（隣居）的福，每天聽，每晚聽，聽也要聽，不聽也要聽，像這樣非聽不可的，實在聽得有點頭痛，而那一類歌曲對於我的惡感也更加深了一層。爲着這種討厭的聲音，使我常常記起過去在××讀書時，每逢一早就開出宿舍的門挾了一本書，到附近　城頭上去呼吸，映着初升的太陽讀。那時在總有一陣陣悠揚而壯雄的軍號聲，　遠處的軍營裏透起，順着微風過來，使人頓時有有一種清醒之感，而起跨馬長征，馳騁漠北的想念。此情此景，直到現在，永永使我不能忘懷。年來所聽到成千萬遍流行歌曲所給予我的好感，不及使我聽一回馬號。但我没法，至今還是給這種雰圍包裹着而不能遂我的要求。</p>
<p>近來當局者似頗注意於此。前有南京市府的禁止（毛毛雨，而閲本月十日本報南昌通訊，知贛省教廳亦在取締有傷風化之音樂，並經議决嚴厲禁止黎錦暉流之唱片，流行本省，並派員到各影戲院去檢查留聲機片，及取締各商店售賣，大有一舉肅清之意，這是一樁好的事情。這一類（十八摸）（打牙）變相的歌曲，早就該消滅了。——但我們並不是爲了（風化）二字，而是爲高尚的娛樂與國家的前途想。這一種歌曲，本是舊時的産物，而不適於新中國羣衆所需要的。</p>
<p>但音樂是人生精神娛樂上所需要的東西，取締以後，又該怎樣呢？將禁演唱，就算完事嗎，没有新的更好的來代替，它是仍舊會再起内：不然就是再編一雙類似的出來，那你就禁不勝禁，結果是禁者自禁，唱者自唱，效果也就可見。所以要移風易俗的話，就得提高一般聽衆賞音的水凖，製造出好的歌曲，是當前一個最先决的問題。這裏不能不怪我們的音樂守在太少，至今還没有編出一隻通合時代中國所需要的歌曲來給羣衆唱唱。</p>
<h3>腿的代價</h3>
<p>— 木郎</p>
<p>前天某夜報上載着一條題作（獨脚兵購鞋一隻）的電訊：</p>
<p>廣州十二日——滬戰中失去一足之兵一人，向某鞋店購鞋一隻，店主不允，致遭毆擊，遂扭送法院。經判决購鞋須成雙；若購一隻，在理宜加拒絶。</p>
<p>策行一世人生道上</p>
<p>讀了這條新聞之後，誰都會有一些感想。有的人覺得那皮鞋店主太要惡了；有的或許覺得這樁事情很含有drama的氣息，足以使飯後的消化便利些；有的……</p>
<p>我自然也有我的感想。</p>
<p>那兵士據説是十九路軍裏面的罷。不過，這没有關係，誰管他是十九路或不是十九路？總之我對於他這次行動的觀察的斷語是：</p>
<p>他是一個祗知打小算盤的無用黑心人</p>
<p>可是言之？他買皮鞋祗要買一隻，當然四爲一隻皮鞋的代價要比一雙的便宜。否則他又何必爲了店主不答應賣一隻，而毆擊那店主呢？但一雙鞋子售去了一隻，那剩餘的一隻便等於廢棄了。拿去賣給誰呢？如果等不到别的壞掉和那兵士正好相反的一隻脚的人來買，（而且脚寸大小也要一樣。）那末，店主的本便蝕定了。但蝕本生意是不做的。所以我認爲那店主拒絶兵士的買賣，理由十分正大，措置十分適當。</p>
<p>那兵士一定因爲要省些皮鞋錢的緣故，才去把他的一條腿放在滬戰中去犧牲，這個算盤可謂打得精小之極！</p>
<p>但他把一條腿來換一隻皮鞋，究竟有睦不值得，何况這交易並没做成功而他單方面的代價，却已付出去了。所以我説他祇會打小算盤，所以他是一個無用黑心人！</p>
<p>除此以外，再也找不出第二個理由，能使他忍心把腿犧牲掉。我很想知這，並且都望有第二個理由的存在，但我怎樣也不能知道。如果有人以爲有第二個理由的存在的，那我先要請問這位先生：</p>
<p>他在戰爭中犧牲了他的腿，但他所獲得的報酬是什麽？（二二·一二·十三）</p>

<h3>上海的異國情調和中國風</h3>
<p>— 子林</p>
<p>（上海是飽含着許多異國情調Exoatic　mood），許多曾經受過一歐化教育，而又有文學嗜好的青年們，總是喜歡這樣説。</p>
<p>的確，没有到過外國去過的青年們，在上海也的確可以領略一些西洋風味。這兒有美麗的櫉飾，有紅紅綠綠的閃爍不定的廣告的燈光，有優雅的咖啡座，有夜總會，有跳舞廳，有酒吧間，有極司非而路一帶的住宅區，紅紗燈從窗帘裏漏了出來，房裏隠約可以看得見西洋紳士的往來的側影。Lilhonete到了晚上，一陣一陣的鋼琴聲，從住宅裏吐出來傳到在法國公園，極司非而公園，并肩散步的青年男女們的耳朶裏。的確，在上海有錢的公子哥兒可以得到一切近代人的舒適和娛樂。</p>
<p>但是這些異國情調，在曾經久住在外國的，我絲毫也引不起什麽感觸。相反的，我一到上海來所感觸到的，却是另外的一面！就是上海的中國風味。</p>
<p>舉外國的都市的例來説罷，譬如在漢堡，那兒有排列如林的檣桅，那兒有起重機轆轆聒耳的怪呌，汽笛聲火車聲從工廠裏傳來的隠隠的機器的響聲、從高與的烟囱口上吐出來的滿江的烟霧…這些都使人感覺到牠是一個近代的工業的城市。但在上海的黄浦江呢，除了沿江的幾個堆棧外，只是有幾間零落的工廠。在黄浦江首先看得見的倒是外國人的兵艦，掛上各種各色的國旗，把大砲的砲嘴指向着黄浦江的兩岸。遠遠的望得見Cathey　Hotel和其他幾間什麽大飯店高高轟立着，但看一看他們旁邊的其他的房子又矮小得十分可憐。黄浦灘上遠遠的有許多車馬的往來，瘦小的黄包車夫，在提着兩條可憐的腿，同二十世紀的Ford的汽車賽跑。碼頭旁邊一大羣的搬運的苦力，接客的侍者一看船來便一擁上前喧嚷成一片，在這裏我們絲毫也看不見什麽異國情調，倒是十足的（中國的）風光，半殖民地的風光。</p>
<p>走到南京路去，沿街飄蕩着駭人的（偉大）的街招，門上還要寫上了本店大（傾銷）的字樣，那一般大的商店却僱了一些Ochestra大吹大擂的吹着黎明輝之類的小調，想來招攬僱客，維持着他的名利鱼我所欲也熊掌亦我所欲也士英作</p>
<p>苟延殘喘的生命。如果站到永安公司門口一看，那麽我們就可以看得見那十字路口不特有汽車，電車，脚踏車，黄包車，而且還有一推一送的二輪小車，獨輪小車，渺小地夾在這許多車輪裏面。如果倫敦巴黎也是一樣的擠擁，但的確没有上海來得這樣複雜，這裏的確充滿了合古今中外一爐而冶之的奇怪的——都市風味。</p>
<p>假如你到過羅馬，那麽人們會告訴你每一城有一色，那麽在上海四馬路附近我們就可以聞得到每一間店有一味。譬如説你經過藥材店的時候你聞得見有藥材味，你走過臘味店，你聞得見有臘味你走過炒良薌風栗的地方你聞得見風栗味，你走過什麽酒家你聞得見辣子味，走過醬園聞得見醬味，如果你在這些路上打一個圈子，包管你在鼻子裏裝滿了這些各種各色味兒的混合物。又假如你是Beudelaire一類的詩人，那麽包管你在這裏巡視一過以後，便可以做出（詩中有味）的詩來但是這些究竟還是咱們老片的中國貨，絲毫也没有什麽（異國的情調）在裏頭！</p>
<p>還有，在上海北四川路一帶可以看到佩着刺刀雄糾糾的日本水兵，在法租界我們可以看得見許多帶着歪帽子的安南兵（？）在十字路口我們可以看得見許多英國巡捕和紅頭阿三在咤叱風雲指揮如意。這些人物比起我們中國内地的丘八老爺漂亮得多了。這大槪也算是異國情　罷。但是這種異國情調是中國式的異國情調，在歐洲這樣的異國情調我倒還没有看見呢！</p>
<p>可惜得很，上海的這些中國風味已經給許多久住在上海的高等華人忘記了，他們正在追逐着異國情調的繁華哩！</p>
<h3>德哥派拉和女人</h3>
<p>— 大路</p>
<p>法小説家德哥派拉到中國來。在上海，曾爲他忙着開招待會，載盛大新聞，出（特刊）。在南京，也曾受要人們（設宴洗塵）。可是到了北平，却給女作家駡爲（文氓），而擬對他警告。　　原因是在北平他還是未談文學，而談女人，且説出了想和中國女人結婚的野心。因之激怒了新浪漫的女作家（女界智識份子）要提出嚴重抗議。（見十一日申報）</p>
<p>德氏他雖到過美國十多次，到過阿根廷，印度，摩洛哥。可是他不曾到過中國，所以對於我們中國這古國的人心（特别是女人）實在瞭解得不够。</p>
<p>我們（中國女人素尚禮義）現在（摩登女子）雖然把（衣服裹在身上），但（禮義）是依然保持着不失去的。這（東方美一層恐不獨德氏不能明瞭，即久居中國而研究美術者亦未必澈底瞭解）。</p>
<p>（中國女子以蘇州最美），誠然。但（高尚之蘇州女子）更美。（歌女雪艷琴）不能爲（蘇州女子之代表）。德氏見了（雪艷琴）的（裊婷態度）而（迷住了幾天），這是太少見多怪了。他應該（與高尚之蘇州女子長談），認識她們（獨立的人）（？）但是切不可（信口雌黄），（不談戀愛，即談結婚）。要知道（法國青年談戀爱，中國青年亦談戀愛）。</p>
<p>德氏知道（中國菜很好，中國女子很美）這是很偏面的。他不知道中國菜好，要細細嚼才能辨得出滋味；中國女子的美，要（長談）過才能瞭解出眞諦。</p>
<p>不然，他（預備守獨身四五十年，……見到很美的中國女子）還是不能（改變宗旨，與中國女子結婚）。</p>
<p>德氏眞是個（文氓），他不知道（東方美）而竟談（中國女子美不可言）。這次受到了女作家（警告）後，不但（預備寫篇小説）有了充實的題材，而且還能得到他（理戀中的目的人）。這當然得視他能否努力探求中國女子的幽默。</p>
<h3>業餘信箱　纔得枝棲又思遷</h3>
<p>編輯先生：</p>
<p>鄙人於廿五歲結婚，今年三十二歲了。因經濟的驅使，東奔西馳，日無停足，故自結婚至今，計與内子同居，總共不夠半年。幸内子深明大義，並未以此見責；而且常常來函勸勉。鄙人現已在滬謀得職業，每月薪金四十元，爲數雖微；但從此可免奔走之苦了；且與上峯及請同事，感情亦極融洽。每月節衣縮食。所餘尚夠家用，但似此下去，内子　　勉强諒解，然在人情道理上，似乎説不過去。若使内子來滬同居？但滬地生活昻貴，左思右想，衣食住行四十元斷乎不敷開支。較好的職業，因無好的背景，加之不學無術，實在不能謀得。鄙人已熟思再四，無法解决，眞使我進退維谷。先生是社會的慈航，一有求必應），請您指示我個辦法，不勝感激之至。敬祝撰安鄙人王瞻魯上</p>
<p>×　　×　　×　　×　　×</p>
<p>編者按：照目下滬上生活程度而論，每月有四十元進欵，自己的膳食，倘使能由供職處所供給，那麽已可勉强維持一個小家庭了。物質的享受，也許會因遷居滬上而稍感艱窘，但因此而精神方函的獲得，是足以抵償的。王君説熟思再四，四十元斷乎不敷，大槪因爲家累太重或食指衆多罷。我們贊成你把别的用度，儘量節省，祇須在不築債臺一個條件之下，將你夫人接到上海來同居。至於想謀一個較好的職業，當然也是辦法。不過這决不能徒恃一種憧憬，而自嘆息於没有好的背景，或過去求學機會的鮮少。我們應當抓住現在的一刹那間，努力奮鬭，只怕英雄無用武之地，有了職業，不怕他如何惡劣，終算有了努力的方向了。繼續不斷的努力，荒地尚有墾熟的一天，何况你現下的位置，比上雖不足，比下尚屬有餘呢。纔得棲身之地，便生厭惡之心，是成功的最大阻力。</p>

<h3>上海（十八）</h3>
<p>— 張老三</p>
<p>卅兩個月</p>
<p>迷迷糊糊的睡着，不知道跑過了幾天，我心地却很清靜的，圍攏在我床前的有許多人，他們爲我請了醫生，臂上似乎被刺了一下，但是一切没有我想像的自由，我不能開口，不能轉側，像到了另一個世界，都是糢糢糊糊的。</p>
<p>每一次張開眼來，床前總是川流着人，對於他們盛意的愛護，我惟有點點頭表示謝意。表姊每天也來一次，她已忘了那次（三角戀愛）的變故，她和敏姊很熱地談着笑着。見我醒來的時候，她們殷勤的在我床前侍候，或者故意的講一個我們小時候的故事。捉魚，摸蚌，塗黑了臉，這一連串的事實好像我們恢復了童年時代；我無論在怎樣厭倦的時候，總得提起精神來揷一句話，或者笑一聲，使她們不致感到失望。</p>
<p>在病中的歲月眞是過去得那樣的快，説得可憐，我三年來没有過着這般舒服的生活。每天有醫生來按脈開方，喝茶吃飯，慧姊和敏姊眞按時爲我預備好了的；不過天天我希望我的病能夠痊愈。社中的事高飛自然更形忙碌了，他代替了我的職務，還要籌劃一切方針，我見他每天到我床前來的時候都是那樣怱促，我很想和他談談，他老是阻止着我，要我安心養病，他説祇要我的病好，忙碌）點有什麽要緊。</p>
<p>我在病榻上過了兩個月，炎夏也將完了，蟬聲送來已不再那樣聒噪，牠似乎感到秋來的悲哀。我却能夠免强起床在房中走這末一二個來回，弟弟每天帶許多報紙給我看，他有時告訴我那個影戲很好看。</p>
<p>（你怎知道的？）我對慧姊敏姊望着笑了。</p>

<p>（你也有錢請客嗎？）</p>

<h3>瑙瑪希拉的戀愛史（下）</h3>
<p>— 思瀛</p>
<p>（三）愛苗的茁生以至良緣締結</p>
<p>從此以後，瑙瑪希拉就發憤工作起來。她研究著，留心看著學習著，不覺試辦期已届滿。有一天下午，瑙瑪做了一天極辛苦的工作，她跑到那間大方屋子裏去見總經理。總經理照舊的笑着，將一張新合同提給她。她從頭到底，仔細地讀着。她讀完了説道：（但是－）那少年總經理很和藹而很堅决的對她説；（或者那不是你所希望得的薪水－或者你的工作還值得多些；但是，希拉小姐，這是我們現在最優的條件了。）瑙瑵當然有她的見解。他們爭論了總有半個鐘。後來瑙瑪憤然道：（好我簽字好了。不過我要告訴你，你第一次給我的合同，並不是我生平第一次的合同。我從前和寰球公司亦訂過合同，那還遠在我和這個公司訂合同之前呢！）</p>
<p>泰爾堡聽見了，哈哈地笑了起來。於是瑙瑪忽然想起了一件事－想起了她從前一天晚上曾經寫過一封信，給一個不相識的人。她記起他的名字來了！她突然問道：（你就是那個泰爾堡先生嗎？）泰爾堡看着她美麗的面龐，漲得飛紅，就説道：（是的。）瑙瑪道：（現在你呌我簽這張合同嗎？）泰爾堡道：（當然。）於是瑙瑪就歡然地簽了字出來了。</p>
<p>當然，自從瑙瑪的美貌和地位被人家認識了之後，大家就開始，追逐着。偶然的她亦接受過他們的邀請。但是，雖然大家都百方獻媚，去博取她的歡心，或是送花，送糖，或是歌頌贊揚，總是不能打動她的芳心。而在别一方面，她心中早已藴藏了一個秘密。她每天晚上，在攝影場作完了一天的工作之後，她一定要跑上極高的樓梯，經過那間大方屋子的門口，才到她自己的化妝室。於是她必定要在那間屋子的門口站立一回。一天不作這個工作，就會使她心中忽忽若有所失的。</p>
<p>又過了許多時候，在一天的下午，她正在化妝，預備上攝影場去，忽然電話響了。她搽了一面孔的油，連忙笑着去接電話。那是泰爾堡的秘書打來的。他説泰爾堡留下了一句話，問她能不能和他去看今天的某大片的第一次公映。當然在好萊塢大片子的第一次公映，是很莊重的一件事，各大明星都要到的，瑙瑪没有拒絶同一位鼎鼎大名的製片家同去的道理。於是她就很高興地答應了，那就是瑙瑪希拉和泰爾堡的第一次一同出去，亦是她生平最快樂的一天。</p>
<p>泰爾堡亦是生平第一次感覺到熱戀。而瑙瑪呢，亦早已深深浸沉在愛情之中了。等到明天早起，瑙瑪的母親問她昨天晚上看見些什麽，她竟茫然不知所對，因爲昨天晚上的事，好像騰雲跨霧似的，她一些亦記不起來了。這就是他們認識了三年，初嘗戀愛滋味的光景。自從那天晚上起，他們就常常一同出去，跳舞哩，吃飯哩，跑馬哩，看戲哩，游泳哩，他們漸漸形影不相離了。然後那件千古以來所不可避免的事發生了。那是在一天晚上，他們跳了四次舞，他低低喘息着問她道：（瑙瑪，親愛的，我有一個口供要説話給你聽，我愛你愛得太厲害了。並且我都想過，你實在係我世界上惟一的女子。你可以嫁給我嗎瑙瑪？）親愛的瑙瑪的臉頓時紅暈了。她在愛爾温的耳朶邊，説了一個字，那個字是泰爾堡自從生了耳朶，没有聽見個那樣甜蜜的聲音。那就是Yes二個字。（完）</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3>評（瀟湘夜深時）</h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>A　Bedtime　Story</p>
<p>－大光明映－</p>
<p>希佛萊自從（璇宮艷史）而後，居然在觀衆的記憶中佔着重大的位置。這决不是偶然的事蹟，而明確的是社會的病態。</p>
<p>在這種情形之下，希佛萊能夠以其瀟酒的風姿來吸收瀟酒的觀衆，於是他便成爲製片者不可多得的人材。</p>
<p>更進一層説，少數的電影觀衆所以歡迎希佛萊，正因爲他們太單調了，總得找一種消遣的方法。而所謂較爲方便的消遣，便是到電影院看希佛萊，和看羅克，勞萊哈台完全一樣。當然這種觀衆不會脱離現社會而生活的，反之，希佛萊等人也不會應運而生。</p>
<p>一切的一切，不會脱離經濟機構而形成的。</p>
<p>○　○　○　○</p>
<p>旣然是成名而賺錢的演員，自然編劇者得特别爲他編製劇本。這决不是没有理由的。不過在這裏却發現了編劇者眞是能幹，居然能想得出如此適合希佛萊個性的劇本。可不是嗎？使他滿不在乎的和女性糾纒，使他唱了幾段輕鬆的歌曲。這都是希佛萊，拿手好戲，也可以讓紳士淑女們嘻笑顔開。</p>
<p>然而；在這裏我們看不到一點積極性，也看不到一點人生的素描，充其量不過是有了這麽一個故事，補滿了幾千呎膠片的空白。－而這也就是劇作者最終的目的。</p>
<p>不過，假使有人説，窮夫婦養不活小孩，不得不遺棄在汽車上以救活小孩兒的性命……而同一的小孩，換過了一個環境，居然是養尊處優，…這能説完全没有意義嗎？那末，我就要説：對了，有是有這麽一點的，但是給全部的輕鬆所溶化，已經在空中消毁無餘了。雖然有還是等於没有啊。何况這到底劇作者一點很小的意外的收獲，這對於没有小孩兒生身父母同樣之生活感情的人們，是不會理解其中之苦楚的。</p>
<p>○　○　○　○</p>
<p>再説，導演也不能説没有有本領。譬如説希佛萊解開衣裳給乳小孩吃，兩次三番的解開外衣又解開背衣，使觀衆們大笑。後來掏出來的是一只貴重的錶，觀衆笑了，錶給小孩摔坯了，又笑，於是接二連三的就給他摔坯了三個錶。摔坯了三個錶是没有關係的，只要使觀衆發笑就成功了。</p>
<p>此外，他將小孩穿上大人的衣服，睡在大床上，慢慢的將鏡頭後移，使觀衆嘩然大笑，這一點倒眞是有把握而聰明的成績。　　再没有什麽可説了，平庸而通俗的喜劇。</p>
<h3>冰島遇險記</h3>
<p>— 評摩爾</p>
<p>“S.O.S.Iceberg”－新光－</p>
<p>關於（冰島遇險記）之類的影片，連戲院宣傳上也説明（是帝國主義拓地的初步政策。（見本片廣告），但是他們很巧妙的辯護説：（不如説是歐洲探險隊犧牲的驚人收穫）。（同前）像這張（冰島遇險記），説是（驚人收穫），自然是可以的。因爲他在丹麥屬地格林蘭的冰天雪地中攝製，不過在這種人迹罕至的地方，（有的只是土人）我們的攝影隊，央然明去工作，與其説（忠於藝術），不如説（忠於錢袋）的。何况在這以外，還用連宣傳上揭出的作用呢？</p>
<p>不過，這張（冰島遇險記）和其他探險片的意義却不能相提并論。原因自然因爲他是攝苦寒的地帶，同時又是實地攝製之故，還是不久以前的事，美利堅的飛機，拚命的向北歐飛，歐洲的破冰船，在北冰洋中，艱苦的航行著。目的是想尋尋冰天雪地中到底有没有幾條意外的路，去獵取那只（西伯里亞的大熊）！這張（冰島遇險記），是兼有這個意義的。所以（冰島遇險記）的故事，雖然簡單，但對於他的作用，是并没有遣憾的完成。據説：目前一般航空家正凖備把（格林蘭）島，與歐洲通部，不是有力的説明嗎？</p>
<p>自然（冰島遇險記）的製作，是拿攝影技術作中心的。像冰山的全景，是一方面候春冰層的堆積，一方面是利用鏡頭的剪接，這就是普特符金電影導演論中，所謂（電影的空間）。本來凡是這一類影片，差不多無例外的依靠影攝術，這張（冰島遇險記），不過更成功罷了。在别的（冰雪探險片）中，我們常常可以看到風雪的猖狂，這是最容易振撼觀衆的。在這張（冰島遇險記），雖則不大見，但已經使人覺得瑟瑟寒生了。</p>
<p>記得（白地獄），也是一張差不多的片子，但他的音響效果，是特别成功，狂風大雪的振動觀衆的靈魂，使觀衆幾乎和戲中人感到同樣的置身於冰天雪地之中。這自然是名導演的特長，而是（（冰島遇險記）望塵莫及的。假使我們要舉（冰島遇險記）的失敗，就在這個地方吧！雖則冰塊的敲擊着聲音，已經可聽，而和劇情以及劇的情調，是不相配合的。</p>
<p>勞迪拉洛克的表演，是相當的成功，不過平平而已。</p>
<h3>袁美雲的兩個愛人</h3>
<p>— 碧芙</p>
<p>至今我方始在電影界裏發現了一個最天眞的女明星，她就是（中國海的怒廟）主角袁美雪</p>
<p>平常，她連説一句話，都是非常天眞，同時又十分有趣地呌人可笑。昨天的事情，寫出來那更覺有趣了。</p>
<p>一位導演，向袁美雲笑道：（你有愛人没有？）袁美雲毫不滬疑地答道：（有的。導演萬萬料不到她竟會回答，而且還會説有的。這一下就像哥倫布發現了新大陸一樣的新奇，當卽連忙追問道：（那末是誰呢？）</p>
<p>（是誰嗎？不高興説了。）</p>
<p>（袁小姐怕難爲情呀？）</p>
<p>（怕什麽難爲情，我的愛人有兩個呢。）</p>
<p>這句話格外緊張了，於是就轟動了導演室裡許多人，大家逼着她説：她當即在檯上拿起一盃茶來呻一口，恂恂如説道：　　（我的兩個愛人是爸爸和媽媽！）（却酬）</p>
<h3>電影小説花蕚情深（Ｌittle　Woman）（十）</h3>
<p>— 素因</p>
<p>當美格和她姑母爭論的時候，勃羅克又回來了，他忘記了他的雨傘。因此美格和她姑母所講的話，都被他聽見了，這是足以使他驚喜若狂的。後來美格涙眼模糊，盲然地跑到客堂，她以爲勃羅克已經走了，永遠見不到他了，但是一個人突然上前抱住她，使她嚇了一跳。那原來是勃羅克。勃羅克道：（寳貝，你説的話是眞的嗎？祇要你允許我一個愛你的機會，我不怕等候，一直到我能够組織一個家庭的時候。）美格低聲喊著：（是的，約翰）。他們緊緊的摟着，兩顆心在一起地跳躍着。</p>
<p>這個時候，奇奥偷偷兒下了樓梯，想聽聽美格怎樣地拒絶那勃羅克，可是她没有進客堂，已經看見他們摟著像一座石像似的。她就飛奔地又上樓了。從此之後，光陰亦好像在飛奔著。直到有一天，美格和約翰在馬區家的花園裏結婚了，牧師就是馬區先生。婚禮完畢之後，一對新夫婦走了，到他們的新居去了。奇奥獨自一個在那古舊的大門口，悵惘地踱著，心中想起幼年時姊妹間的快樂光景，現在已經漸漸付與流水，她覺得有無限的悽凉。勞萊輕輕走近了她，拉著她的手安慰著她。奇奥心裏眞是説不出的感激，但是她看見了勞萊的臉，那種呆瞪瞪的眼神，她明白那是什麽意思，於是她又害怕起來了。她自問是不會使他快樂的。他應當娶一位美麗，有才幹，善於交際的人，作一個大家庭的主婦。况且他們性情亦不同。一個歡喜社交，一個是厭惡社交；一個喜歡著作，一個反對著作。他們時常吵著嘴，過後又和睦，更加深深地相愛著。但是，講到婚姻，那是另外一件事了！因此，儘著勞萊苦苦地求告，她總是拒絶著。最後勞萊於失望之餘，憤然説道：（好吧。你説你不嫁人。我知道你是要嫁人的。總有一天你會遇見一個没出息的儍瓜，你愛上了他，嫁了他，爲他而作一輩子的牛馬。我倒要等著看看呢！）他説了跳起來就走了。奇奥追在後面喊著他，但是她看見他頭也不回地飛奔而走，她知道這個高傲的勞萊，不會再來的了。她於是靠在大門口的柱子上，哭起來了。</p>
<p>媽嬭是很明白的，當奇奥進來説她要出門去的時候。她冷眼地看著家園中羅曼斯的逐漸開花結果；她又覺奇奥的羅曼斯，是難以開花的。她柔聲地問著奇奥：（你眞不愛他嗎？）奇奥説：（我是愛他的。我深切地愛他。我使他傷心，自己的心亦像刀割一樣。但是我恐怕蹈了失足之恨…）她鳴咽著。媽嬭拍着她的肩膀道：（奇奥，你的主意是對的。這樣，於你們兩個人都有好處。你可以出趟門散散心換換空氣。我來和你父親商量。要是他不反對的話，我來寫封信給吉爾格夫人。（未完）</p>

<h3>Resolutions of the Central Executive Committee Standing Committee: Fourth Plenary Session Postponed to January 20, 1934; Measures for Reorganizing Fujian Party Affairs Approved</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central Committee held its 102nd Standing Committee meeting at 9 a.m. on the 14th. Over 30 members were in attendance, including Yu Youren, Wang Zhaoming, Ye Chucang, Ju Zheng, Sun Ke, Shao Yuanchong, Chen Lifu, Kong Xiangxi, Zhou Qigang, Fang Juehui, Li Zonghuang, Wu Jingheng, Lin Sen, and Hong Ludong. Ju Zheng presided. The following important matters were resolved: (1) The Fourth Plenary Session was postponed to January 20, 1934; (2) Measures for reorganizing Fujian party affairs were approved: 1. Lin Sen, Yang Shuzhuang, Fang Shengtao, Ding Chaowu, Zhang Zhen, Zeng Zhongming, and Dai Kuisheng were appointed as seven members of the Fujian Party Affairs Review Committee. All party affairs in Fujian Province, concerning organization, propaganda, and people's movement, etc., will be reviewed and implemented by the Review Committee; 2. A special commissioner for Fujian Province's party affairs will be appointed from among the Review Committee members to go to Fujian to exercise the functions of the Provincial Party Headquarters. After the military situation ends, a provincial representatives' conference will be convened to establish a formal Provincial Party Headquarters; 3. Jiang Guangnai, the originally appointed preparatory commissioner for the Provincial Representatives' Conference, should be immediately removed; (3) Tang Qunying was appointed as honorary compiler of the Party History Materials Compilation Committee; (4) Fang Juehui was recommended to report at the Central Memorial Week next Monday; (5) Other routine cases. (Central News Agency dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The postponement of the Fourth Plenary Session for a month. When someone asked Central Committee member Shi Ying about the reason, Shi replied, "China's current situation is truly like a heap of loose sand. During this time of serious national crisis, opinions from all sides still cannot be unified. If the meeting were held hastily, I fear there would be no good outcome. Also, because the proposals have not been sent to the meeting, the session is postponed for a month so that all parties can meet each other with sincerity and frankness under mutual understanding, so that various political difficulties can be resolved easily. Our country has now entered a state of extreme poverty and hardship. The military expenditure, according to the budget before February, is more than 28 million yuan per month. After the Fujian Incident, military expenditure has increased again. If all other government expenses are included, it must reach more than 30 million yuan. The Ministry of Finance's monthly income is only about 20 million yuan, a huge difference of 10 million yuan. It is difficult to increase revenue and difficult to reduce expenditure. In addition, the bankruptcy of rural areas is especially worrying. Production is an essential element of nation-building. In recent years, due to natural disasters and man-made calamities, production has decreased daily and consumption has increased. If foreign rice and wheat are imported, it amounts to more than 100 million yuan annually. Other cigarette imports require 20 million yuan annually. In particular, the consumption of women's cosmetics and perfumes is more than 1.4 million yuan. China is being squeezed and surrounded by these pressures; how can it not be poor? Therefore, I hope that the Central Committee members can pay attention to this and count the production methods to save China. As for the issue of changing the committee system in various provinces to a governor system, I have already submitted a proposal. Opinions have been gathered from all parties, and it is currently being sorted out by the Regulations Consolidation Committee. The drawbacks of the committee system lie in the divergence of opinions and the weakness of the authority of the chairman and members. Therefore, every proposal must go through repeated discussions by many people, and the result is little. If Britain always uses the committee system, under the authority of the chairman and members, every proposal is immediately put to a vote. It is not like our country, where opinions conflict at every turn. However, the governor system is autocratic. If people are not used properly, the drawbacks will be even greater than the committee system. Therefore, even after the governor system is implemented, I also hope that the Central Committee will give careful consideration to the selection of candidates." (Special dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Central Committee member Chu Minyi said, "The Fourth Plenary Session was originally scheduled to be held on the 20th of this month. As of the morning of the 13th, preparations were still being made to open as scheduled. Later that evening, a telegram was received from Zhang Ji, Ma Chaojun, etc., regarding the progress of their contact with Hu Hanmin and Chen Jitang. They also decided to go to Nanning on the 18th to meet with Li Zongren and Bai Chongxi for consultations. The earliest they can return to Guangdong is the 20th, and then they will try to bring the Southwest members north together. If that is the case, it will be difficult to arrive on time. Therefore, when the Standing Committee met today, in order to seek practical unity, it was decided to postpone the session to January 20, 1934. The Central Committee has now issued a notice to the Central Committee members in various places to avoid futile travel. It also telegraphed Zhang et al. to proceed with the consultations at their leisure." (Special dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central Executive Committee Standing Committee resolved on the 14th to postpone the Fourth Plenary Session for one month. The reason is to facilitate the Central Committee members scattered across the country to arrive in the capital at their leisure. The Central Executive Committee is now drafting a budget for the Fourth Plenary Session expenses, including</p>
<p>publicly funded reception, business travel expenses, totaling more than 64,000 yuan. (Central News Agency dispatch, 14th) (Nanjing) The Central Executive Committee decided to postpone the Fourth Plenary Session for one month. On the 14th, the Central Executive Committee specifically telegraphed Zhang Ji, Ma Chaojun, Chen Zhaoying, and Wang Luyi, four Central Committee members, hoping that they would proceed with the consultations in Guangdong at their leisure. The original telegram said: "Guangzhou, Zhang Ji, Ma Chaojun, Chen Zhaoying, Wang Luyi, Four Gentlemen, greetings. Your telegrams have been fully understood. The Standing Committee decided today that since it will take a considerable amount of time for all comrades to consult on everything and for the members in Guangdong, Guangxi, and Hong Kong to depart, the Fourth Plenary Session will be postponed for one month to January 20, 1934. This is specially communicated by telegram, hoping that you will proceed with the consultations at your leisure and telegraph updates at any time, and also forward to all comrades in Guangdong, Guangxi, and Hong Kong. Central Executive Committee, humbly." (Central News Agency dispatch, 14th)</p>
<h3>Southwest Executive Department Political Council Holds Joint Meeting Zhang and Others Attend and Express Opinions; Plans to Meet Li and Bai Directly in Nanning Today Southwest Side Recommends Four Committee Members to Attend Fourth Plenary Session</h3>
<p>(Guangzhou) The Executive Department Political Council held a temporary joint meeting in the Political Council conference hall at 9 a.m. this morning. Zhang, Ma, Wang, Chen, etc. all attended. Zou Lu gave a welcome speech. Zhang Ji immediately stated the Central Committee's intentions and the purpose of coming south. The committee members exchanged views, which was quite harmonious. At 12 o'clock, the whole group went to the Provincial Government Chairman Lin Yunhai's banquet. The meeting continued at 2 p.m. and adjourned at 3:30 p.m. After the meeting, according to reporters' inquiries from reliable sources, the committee members preliminarily exchanged opinions on the current situation today, and their attitudes towards each other were extremely sincere. In principle, it was recognized that unity was indeed necessary, but there were no relatively concrete results. (Far East News Agency dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) The Zhang, Ma, and other committee members plan to enter Wuzhou on the 15th and transfer to Nanning to meet with Li and Bai.

<h3>Zhang, Chen, Ma, and Wang Four Representatives Aboard the Piasus Wheel =Southwest Committee Members Share Consistent Views=</h3>
<p>(Guangzhou) Zou Lu told a reporter from the New Sound News Agency that "We take Hu's opinions as our own opinions. Hu spoke to reporters in great detail. If you want me to speak, I still worry about omissions. Chen Jitang and the committee members are completely in agreement and are even more in accord with Xiao (Focheng) and Deng (Zeru). They meet most frequently every day and talk most closely. Otherwise, how can we stand? We strongly refute the rumors of external divisions." He also said, "We have fully understood the intentions of the four representatives. However, the method must be decided after the meeting. It is planned to submit it when Zhang and others return from Guangxi and pass through the province, because we accompanied them on sightseeing and tours yesterday and today and had no time to hold a meeting.

<p>(Hong Kong) Wang Yangchong, secretary to Hu Hanmin, said, "Hu's attitude towards all parties remains the same. The rumors of alliance with Guizhou and Guangxi and some kind of cooperation are even more groundless. All that Hu has in mind is the party's doctrine. Those who agree with this doctrine are comrades, and those who disagree or oppose this doctrine are enemies. Under this belief, there is no so-called Southwest, Guizhou, or Guangxi. If you do not understand this meaning and think that the end justifies the means and use it to measure others, measure Hu, you are far from the truth. The key today is to liberate civil rights and give the people the opportunity to participate in politics." (New Sound News Agency dispatch, 14th)</p>

<h3>=Chen Jitang's Views on the Current Situation=</h3>
<p>(Guangzhou) Chen Jitang said, "The Southwest's position on the overall situation has always been consistent and has been announced in two consecutive telegrams. I have no other opinions. Guangdong is now actively implementing a three-year plan, focusing on construction, in order to relieve the people's suffering and increase the people's benefits. Due to the Fujian incident, I fear that the Jiangxi bandits will take the opportunity to sneak in. Also, due to the bank runs on banknotes, the people are misled by rumors, which affects local security. Therefore, we have increased our troops to secure the border so that the people will not be moved by rumors and can live and work in peace, so that the government can implement the three-year plan step by step. To be able to protect the territory and secure the people, all politics can be established. The Jiangxi communists must of course continue to be suppressed. The communists kill and set fires, which is not only deeply hated by the people but also considered the most painful thing by the people. The army is the people's armed force. I follow the people's wishes to relieve the people's suffering. The people have recognized that the communists must be suppressed, and the soldiers have no choice but to suppress them. I have always used troops with the people's wishes as my own wishes. If the people need to use troops, they have no choice but to use troops. This time, the central government's four representatives came south, and I hope that they will give more guidance on the province's party affairs and politics. I am a soldier, and I do not want to express my personal views on national affairs." (Far East News Agency dispatch, 14th)</p>

<h3>Yang Dezhao Denies Guangdong Province Will Issue Public Bonds Borrowing Money to Reorganize Finance</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Chen Jitang's representative Yang Dezhao said, "The report that the Guangdong Provincial Government will issue 20 million yuan in public bonds to suppress bandits is not accurate. When Mr. Song Ziwen was in charge of finance in Guangdong, he issued more than 20 million yuan in banknotes. In addition, during the Law Protection War and the Northern Expedition, a total of more than 60 million yuan in treasury bonds, public bonds, etc., were issued successively. They have not been recovered by the central government and are circulating in the market. Given the financial situation in Guangdong Province in recent years, if public bonds are issued again, not only will they be difficult to sell, but they will also increase the burden on the people. Recently, after the Fujian Incident, public bonds, treasury bonds, and banknotes have all declined. Although this is an inevitable trend in every political upheaval, measures must be taken to reorganize it. It is now planned to request the central government to borrow 15 million yuan from the banking industry for the use of Guangdong Province's financial reorganization. Negotiations are currently underway. The rumor that Guangdong Province requested the central government to increase the monthly subsidy by 800,000 yuan is also not true. The central government currently subsidizes Guangdong with 500,000 yuan per month. The bandit suppression, the Fujian Incident will not hinder. In addition to drawing a part of the bandit suppression troops to consolidate the Fujian-Guangdong border, the bandit suppression plan will continue to proceed. Therefore, borrowing 15 million yuan is very necessary." (Special dispatch, 14th)</p>

<h3>Current Commentary: The Seriousness of China's Rural Problem</h3>
<p>For several years, the national rural economy has been increasingly collapsing. And the recent situation is even more serious. To look at the actual examples reported in the local newspapers yesterday, such as the Changshu County Rent Collection Recovery Office last month, there were dozens of cases of landlords requesting permission to recover arrears from tenant farmers every day. Thus, the poverty of the countryside is imaginable. This is one case. Huzhou, more than ten years ago, had a total annual silk production of about 800,000 bolts. In recent years, production has declined sharply. Now, with the Fujian Incident, all factories have stopped operating. This is another case. Jiangzhe is the place where the essence of our country gathers. The rural economy has always been rich because of the production of rice and silk. However, since the economic forces of foreign countries have intensified their intrusion, the self-sufficient rural areas of our country for thousands of years have shown signs of increasing danger. Farmers throughout the country have no means to make a living. The rich lands of Jiangzhe are still in this situation. This is truly a phenomenon that deserves attention at present.</p>
<p>First, let us talk about the impact of rural decline. The status of rural areas in our country is the core of the national economy. It accounts for 80% of the total population. Prosperity depends on the growth or decline of purchasing power. Now that sericulture has declined and rice prices have fallen, the producers in rural areas cannot afford to keep warm and eat well, except for paying rent. Even landlords who own land are at risk of lower land prices due to the fall in the price of agricultural products (that is, the value of the rent received is getting cheaper day by day). This creates panic in the rural economy, and urban industry and commerce also find it difficult to develop. The two are inherently intertwined. This is one aspect of its impact. Since rural areas are the center of the national economy, the foundation of national finances is also closely related to the prosperity or decline of rural areas. Land tax was an important source of central government revenue before the establishment of the National Government. In recent years, it has become the foundation of local finances. The total amount of national revenue is no less than 200 million yuan. If the prices are as low as they are now, farmers owe rent, and landlords owe taxes, then local finances may be shaken. Therefore, the goal of prospering the countryside is also a necessary method to save the financial crisis. This is another aspect of the impact.</p>
<p>From the above-mentioned situation, the center of China's economic problems at present lies in how to mobilize China's rural areas and make production continue to rise. In other words, how can farmers be assured and devote themselves to land utilization in order to increase production? When farmers can increase production, there is hope for the development of urban industry and commerce. There is a way to solve local finances. Gu, what is the skill to mobilize China's rural production? The most fashionable discussion at present is nothing more than improving agricultural finance. The difficulty of farmers is due to the lack of production funds. However, at this time when the national economy is in a state of panic, can farmers afford to use the financial capital of the city? It is an extremely uncertain thing. If there is no such ability, then the destruction of current production will still be impossible to revive. The so-called agricultural financial improvement method is not enough to rely on.</p>
<p>Moreover, we have also heard of the so-called land distribution policy. The so-called land distribution is to seek a way out of the Chinese rural panic by changing the form of land rights. However, in fact, China's economic panic has reached today. The central problem is entirely related to the instability of the rural economy. If we want to find a proper solution, the first thing to do is to give the farmers the real benefits of relief in the present. Maintain the status quo temporarily. Even if the land distribution policy is a way to stabilize the rural economy, how can it be distributed so that farmers can obtain land that they can use freely? The problem is heavy and cannot be solved in a short amount of time. Then, is this method sufficient to solve the current rural emergency? Then, where will the way to rescue the rural economy be. It is truly a problem that deserves the most research today.</p>
<h3>The 19th Route Army Gradually Moves Towards the Zhejiang Border Qiu Zhaochen Is About to Go to the Front Yanjian Still Has No State of War</h3>
<p>(Nanchang) The Fujian side has now decided to concentrate the main force of the 19th Route Army to move towards Zhejiang. Western Fujian has established contact with the Communist Party and will not make military preparations. Southern Fujian has decided to take a defensive posture. The general situation is as follows: (1) Shen Guanghan is the commander-in-chief of the left-wing front, with Liu Zhanxiong's troops of about 5,000 men and Deng Zhicai's six new and old regiments of about 4,000 men, concentrated in Xintian, Jiannan, and Jianyang, planning to advance towards Pucheng Xianxia; (2) Mao Weishou is the commander-in-chief of the right-wing front, with Pang Cheng's two new regiments and three old regiments of about 3,500 men, and Liang Siji's two new and old regiments of about 4,000 men, concentrated in Mazhong, Luoyuan, and Ningde, planning to advance towards Xiapu and Fuan; (3) Qu Shounian is the general reserve force, commanding Zhang Junsong and Yun Yinglin's new and old troops of about 5,000 men, concentrated in Shuikou, Gutian, and Fuzhou; (4) Zhang Yan is the right-wing reserve force, with Xie Qiongsheng and Ruan Baohong's troops of about 5,000 men, planning to transfer to Danyang and Luoyuan; (5) Weng Zhaoyuan's troops Qian Wende and Quan Chengyao's two units, with a force of about 3,000 to 4,000 men, are Chen Guohui's old troops and have no combat effectiveness; (6) Cai Tingkai often travels back and forth to Shuikou and Gutian to inspect; (7) In total, the rebel army claims to have six armies and 120,000 men, but at most 30,000 to 40,000 men can actually fight. (Special dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>(Fuzhou) Pioneer Commander Qiu Zhaochen is about to go to the front. The local area in northern Fujian is as stable as ever. According to merchants who arrived in the province from Yanjian, although the defense forces in that area are constantly mobilized, there is no state of war. (Special dispatch, 14th)</p>
<h3>=Cai Tingkai to Inspect Longyan=</h3>
<p>(Fuzhou) According to today's official report here, Cai Tingkai will go to Longyan for inspection at the end of this week. As Longyan is located on the border between Guangdong and Fujian, Cai's trip indicates the Fujian government's deep attention to Guangdong Province. (Reuters dispatch, 14th)</p>
<h3>=Telegraph: Cai Tingkai Joins Forces with Communists to Invade Zhejiang=</h3>
<p>(Nanchang) After the establishment of the Min puppet government, the Red bandits sent fifty people from the Jiangxi bandit area to participate in various puppet organizations. Many communists who went to Fujian from Shanghai also arrived. When the Fujian rebellion was launched, the communist bandits immediately sent Peng Dehuai's wife and Luo Binghui to Fuzhou to negotiate everything. Recently, Zhu De arrived in the province and held successive joint meetings. Zhu advocated joining forces to invade north, while Cai advocated invading south. Both sides held their ground with great effort. In the end, they followed Zhu's intention and decided to invade Zhejiang. The First Front Army was led by Cai concurrently, while the Second Front Army was led by Zhu. The 19th Route Army has completely joined forces with the bandits. Recently, about two regiments of bandits set off from JiangLe to Yanping. About 2,000 rebellious soldiers from the 60th and 61st divisions, together with the Red bandits, set off from Yanping to Sandukou, passing through Nanshan Dubei, and moving towards Gutian. Also, the bandits and rebellious soldiers from Dadaohu, Lushan, Qingfengling and other places, totaling more than 2,000, are also moving towards Gutian. Huang Qixiang recruited and reorganized the Red bandits in the Changting area and the Min army in southern Zhangzhou to guard the Guangdong border. (14th Central News Agency dispatch)</p>
<h3>=Secret Agreement Terms for Chen and Li's Alliance with Communists=</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Hong Kong telegram: The Fujian rebels Chen Mingshu, Li Jishen, and others have allied with the communist rebel party, established a puppet government, changed the era name, used the people of Fujian as puppets of the rebellion, and used Fujian as a communist experiment. Compatriots throughout the country are outraged upon hearing the news. After investigation, the main terms of the secret agreement signed by Chen and Li with the communist party before their rebellion are as follows: (1) The bandit army will construct in the occupied areas. (2) If Guangdong attacks Fujian bandits in Shanghang and Wuping, the bandits should resist. (3) The Fujian side will provide the bandits with 300,000 yuan in expenses. (4) Fujian should facilitate the bandits' access to grain and other necessities. (5) Establish a worker-peasant-soldier regime. (6) The rebel government shall not have any names, propaganda, or actions against communist bandit suppression. (7) Accept the Red Regiment's policies and implement them in due course. (8) Release the communist bandits detained within the rebel government's territory. (9) Cancel the blockade of the bandit areas and provide them with material assistance. (10) Assign the counties of Jianning, Tingzhou, and Longyan to be garrisoned by the Red bandits. (11) The rebel army is responsible for resisting the Zhejiang Red bandits and Guangdong. At this moment, the elite communist bandits are gradually moving towards the Fujian side. From this perspective, the clear evidence of the rebellion and alliance with the communists by Chen, Li, and others can be seen. Their crimes of betraying the country and harming the people are unforgivable. (14th Central News Agency dispatch) (Nanchang) The Fujian rebels' alliance with the bandits has become a fact. The content learned here is as follows: The Fujian puppet government is proceeding with cooperation with the communist bandits, first implementing the land revolution policy. The Third International has decided to send Mifu (former deputy principal of Moscow Sun Yat-sen University) to China to preside over it. As for the conditions for the Fujian rebels' cooperation with the bandits, there are three: (1) Jointly unite to resist the Central Government and abolish the Kuomintang. (2) Implement the equal distribution of land. (3) Establish a worker-peasant-small bourgeois alliance regime. When the conditions are implemented, (1) the Fujian side will first stop the policy of blockading the Red bandits; (2) in order to avoid targets that are too large, temporarily, within a possible range, express a gray attitude, and the two sides will only secretly communicate; (3) the communist bandits will be the barrier for the 19th Route Army in the northern Fujian area to resist the Central Army; (4) Chen, Cai, and others will station troops in western Fujian, and Luo Binghui (bandit leader) will take over the defense of Longyan to contain Guangdong. The 49th Division will be transferred to Zhangzhou and Xiamen. The Mao bandit troops stationed in Zhangzhou and Quanzhou will all be transferred to northern Fujian to prepare to attack Zhejiang.

He will stay in Ping for two days and then return to his country via Tianjin and take office on the 11th of next month. The rumor of tension between Japan and Russia is not true. It is a fact that the Soviet Union increased its troops to the border because the negotiations between the two sides broke down once due to the Middle East Road issue. However, it has now been resolved. Russia has no need to use troops, so it will naturally gradually withdraw. This matter is the same as the situation in which the United States increased its troops to the Pacific. It has now begun to withdraw. (14th Special Dispatch)</p>

When I was in Shanhaiguan before, the Japanese side did not raise any negotiations, and I had no knowledge of it. The Luanyu Commissioner's Office is currently negotiating with the Japanese army through the railway authorities because the Japanese army is stationed in two houses at Tangshan Station. It can only be established after they withdraw, and it must be done by the end of the year. I will go to handle it after the date of the takeover of Shanhaiguan is set. (14th Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Huang Fu Holds a Tea Party to Raise Funds for the Yellow River Disaster</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Huang Fu hosted a tea party for raising funds for the Yellow River flood at the European and American Alumni Association tonight. (14th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Huang Fu hosted a tea party for raising funds for the Yellow River disaster at the European and American Alumni Association at 5:30 p.m. on the 14th, attended by more than 100 people, including He Yingqin. Huang delivered a speech on the spot, saying that the Yellow River disaster fundraising campaign has achieved good results after the assistance and efforts of everyone, which is not easy. However, the disaster area is vast, and a drop in the bucket will not help. I hope that all sectors will continue to work hard. According to a friend, floods exist both at home and abroad, but foreigners can use them for transportation and power generation. Our country not only cannot use them, but also suffers disasters. This is the drawback of treating the symptoms but not the root cause. Although it is very difficult to treat the root cause of the Yellow River, if we can pay attention to it, it may not be impossible to save it. I am willing to propose to deposit a part of the funds raised this time in the bank and use it to manage the river after five or ten years, which will have a great effect. After Huang's speech, Zhang Yuanshan reported on the progress of fundraising. A total of more than 63,000 yuan has been collected. In addition to continuing to solicit donations, personnel have been sent to the disaster area to investigate and prepare to handle disaster relief. The meeting adjourned at about 6 p.m. (14th Central News Agency dispatch)</p>

<h3>European Disputes Are Eagerly Seeking Resolution, Britain is Willing to Act as a Mediator, Simon Will Roam Europe Next Thursday, On One Hand Promoting Closer Franco-German Relations, On the Other Hand Inquiring About Italy's Attitude Towards the League of Nations</h3>
<p>(London) It is reported that the British Cabinet decided yesterday to make the greatest effort to promote the progress of the Disarmament Conference. It is reported that Foreign Secretary Simon will take advantage of the Christmas holiday to tour Europe. (14th Reuters)</p>
<p>(London) It is reported that Foreign Secretary Simon's tour of Europe during the Christmas holiday is aimed at promoting closer relations between France and Germany and inquiring about Italian Prime Minister Mussolini's attitude towards the League of Nations. (14th Reuters)</p>
<p>(London) British Foreign Secretary Simon is scheduled to visit Europe on December 21. He will meet Peng Gu in Paris and Mussolini in Rome. The British Ambassador to Germany, Fee Pubs, will arrive in London today. (14th Reuters)</p>
<p>(London) The Cabinet held a weekly meeting today, and the discussions were all about the international situation, because the international incidents and disputes have reached an extreme level of danger, and need to be resolved as soon as possible. The failure of the Disarmament Conference, Germany's request for equal arms, Italy's proposal to reform the League of Nations, and the British public's impatience with the government's involvement in European disputes are gradually increasing. Therefore, British politicians feel the need to act as soon as possible. Britain, which has always been in a mediating position between the two extremes, hopes to establish a compromise and benefit itself. Britain is willing to see the success of the Geneva Conference and the realization of general disarmament. This hope has become a bubble, and the situation is becoming more and more tense. Germany's demands are more than just one. Although they have not been made public, it is now known that there are 300,000 regular soldiers with one year of military service, they can manufacture all kinds of weapons that other countries have, and the Saar region will be returned immediately without holding a public assembly, etc. France firmly opposes these conditions. Unless Britain provides it with practical guarantees, that is, if something happens in the future, it will jointly send troops with France to control Germany, it will not allow concessions. However, if the British government gives this kind of guarantee, it will not exist for a week. Furthermore, the opinions of Britain and France also differ on Italy's proposal to reform the League of Nations. France advocates that the League of Nations cannot be changed. The reason why it has this advocacy is that the League of Nations and the Treaty of Versailles are actually linked together, and because France can control the League of Nations with the support of small countries in Central and Eastern Europe. The reason why France maintains the League of Nations is also the reason why the Italian Prime Minister demands to amend the Covenant of the League of Nations. The Italian Prime Minister believes that the time to amend the treaty is ripe, and the system that allows small countries to obstruct the plans of large countries cannot be allowed to exist permanently. Britain, on the treaty level, of course fully expresses its sympathy, but for the small countries, it has no definite position. Although French Ambassador Ponset's second conversation with Hitler admired Britain's mediation, he also expressed that France was still not satisfied with Germany's position and that France had no intention of taking action without consulting its allies. As for Germany, it is currently carrying out its diplomatic maneuvers on two fronts: one is the revision of the treaty, and the other is the equality of armaments. The former has already gained Italy's coordination, and the latter has gained Britain's sympathy. Although Germany is eager to achieve something, it is now known that there can be no concrete results until Czech Foreign Minister Benes visits Paris and French Foreign Minister Peng Gu visits Warsaw and Moscow. France opposes using the League of Nations as a tool to amend the treaty, so it is eager to lobby other countries to launch a counterattack against Italy's plan to attack the League of Nations.

<h3>League of Nations Transformation, Britain Awaits Practical Suggestions</h3>
<p>(London) The Times today discussed the issue of the transformation of the League of Nations, saying that the British government is now awaiting practical suggestions. In terms of the nature of the matter, this kind of suggestion must come from the side that suggests the transformation. The British government's attitude towards the transformation suggestion will depend on whether it can consolidate the League of Nations. Only suggestions containing this condition can receive friendly consideration from Britain. (13th National Electric)</p>
<h3>Britain Plans to Launch a New Disarmament Plan</h3>

When he stays in Paris, he will take the opportunity to inform the French government of the purpose of the new plan and submit it when the General Disarmament Committee meets in January next year. All sectors of the League of Nations are very skeptical about this news, but they also admit that submitting a new plan may break the deadlock caused by the concessions given to France in the Simon plan in October.

<p>(Moscow) Today, the US Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Bullitt, presented his credentials to Kalinin, Chairman of the Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union. Soviet Foreign Commissar Litvinov, Deputy Commissar Krestinsky, and Secretary of the Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union, Yenukidze, were also present. When presenting his credentials, Bullitt conveyed President Roosevelt's warm and friendly greetings to Kalinin, as well as his sincere hope for the prosperity of the Soviet Union. Bullitt said in his speech, "My arrival in your country is not as a stranger. I have had a deep concern for your country for many years. I come here convinced of the importance of my mission and its historical significance. My mission is not only to create normal relations between the two great nations, but also to establish a truly friendly relationship. Our two peoples will seek effective cooperation in many other areas, bound by a mutual desire to maintain peace. At the same time, our two peoples are bound by the shared search for new solutions to new problems, the youthful strength and readiness, and the shared fearless spirit towards the future." Bullitt supported Roosevelt's greetings to Kalinin and the Soviet Union, promising to do his best to consolidate and enhance the bond of friendship between the two countries. Kalinin then gave a reply, first thanking Bullitt for his greetings and asking Bullitt to convey his regards to President Roosevelt. He strongly praised Bullitt's significant contributions to the friendship between the Soviet Union and the United States. Kalinin continued, "I have always believed that once the artificial obstacles in the path of cooperation between the peoples of the Soviet Union and the United States are removed, this cooperation will emerge in the broadest and most complex form. As long as both sides have goodwill and can respect each other, the differences between our two countries' social and political systems need not be an obstacle to this matter. I fully agree with your belief that there should not only be normal diplomatic relations between the peoples of the Soviet Union and the United States, but also a clear friendship." Kalinin then assured Bullitt that the Soviet government was fully determined to help develop this friendship. Kalinin concluded by saying that the firm desire to maintain and consolidate peace has already inspired the people of the Soviet Union and the United States, and this desire will also lay the most solid foundation for the existence of this sincere friendship and its full development.

<h3>Soviet Air Force Strength: Significant Progress in Aircraft Manufacturing Technology, Will Exceed England and France Fivefold in Three Years - Report on French Air Minister's Visit to Russia -</h3>
<p>(Paris) The Foreign Affairs Committee of the Chamber of Deputies held a meeting, chaired by former Prime Minister Herriot. Air Minister Cot presented a report on his observations on the Soviet Union's industrial organization and aviation industry during his visit to the country, with particular emphasis on the production of special raw materials and metals needed for national defense, as well as the manufacturing of various types of aircraft and engines. He then described Russia's industrial capacity and its efforts to develop military equipment and aviation, saying that within two or three years, the Russian Air Force will be more than five times stronger than the air forces of England and France. The technological perfection of Russia's aircraft manufacturing industry is at least equal to that of any other European country. The air force officers and pilots are all top-notch. Some Russian aircraft can carry three to four tons of explosives and still travel long distances, comparable to the distance between Moscow and Berlin. All aircraft factories are working at full capacity and have special equipment to avoid aerial attacks. One of these factories can produce 150 aircraft weighing eighteen tons each year. France only has one of these aircraft. Cot then explained that he was warmly welcomed by officials and people everywhere he went in Russia. The impression gained by the committee members was that Cot and Herriot had visited the Soviet Union one after another to build up friendly relations. Cot's intention was to further strengthen the friendly relations between the two countries. The committee members also believed that if France were invaded, it could obtain significant defensive assistance from the Soviet Union. The committee then debated the two talks between French Ambassador to Germany, François-Poncet, and German Chancellor Hitler. As a result, Chairman Herriot and Foreign Minister Flandin were asked to contact each other and request the Foreign Minister to report all useful information to the committee. (Havas, 13th)</p>
<h3>Herriot's Objective Analysis of the New Russia</h3>
<p>(Paris) Herriot, Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Chamber of Deputies, recently gave a speech here on the situation in the Soviet Union, after his visit to the country. *Le Petit Parisien* recently published the first draft of his speech, stating that he takes a purely objective attitude towards the New Russia. He then analyzed the international situation of the Soviet Union, saying that the close relationship between the Soviet Union and the United States and Italy proves that the Soviet Union is determined to maintain the status quo. As for the Far East issue, it will become increasingly difficult, and the Soviet Union will inevitably play a key role in it. He then analyzed the internal structure of the Soviet Union, saying that the Soviet Union's political system adopts both centralism and respects the autonomy of various ethnic groups, which are well balanced. When discussing the agricultural situation, he said that the population of the Soviet Union is increasing very rapidly, but its land production is very small, so it is very difficult to maintain the people's food supply. However, the famine situation he saw when he visited Russia in 1922 no longer exists. Industrial production has greatly increased. When discussing the nature of the communist system, he said that the Communist Party is determined to achieve a state of absolute equality and bases it on labor. (Havas, 14th)</p>
<h3>Increased Funds for French Air Attaché in China</h3>

<h3>Soviet Russia Strengthens Far East Red Army's Backing, Increases Pay to Benefit Farmers and Workers, No Worry About Food Supply in Case of War with Japan</h3>
<p>(Moscow) Stalin signed an order this morning that, starting from January 1, 1934, the pay for soldiers stationed in the Far East will be increased by 50%, officers by 25%, and workers' wages will also be greatly increased, with heavy industry increasing by 30% and fishermen receiving an additional 20%. Farmers, whether collective or private, are exempt from taxes. The reason announced by the government is that in recent years, the number of people who have moved to eastern Siberia and the Pacific coast has increased, so assistance should be given to help them get started. It is generally believed that the real intention of the Soviet Russian government in taking this action is to strengthen the backing of the Red Army so that the food supply can be secured in the event of war with Japan.

<h3>Military Personnel Appointed to Important Positions in the Far East</h3>

<h3>Italy and Russia Reciprocal Trade, New Tax Treaty Approved by Italian Parliament, Commercial Agreement Still Extended and Valid</h3>

<h3>Hirota Refreshes Diplomacy, Hiroshi Saitō Appointed Ambassador to the United States, Yōtarō Sugimura Appointed Ambassador to England</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Foreign Minister Hirota, in view of the importance of current Japanese-US diplomatic relations, has decided to appoint Hiroshi Saitō, the current minister to the Netherlands, as the new ambassador to the United States. He has obtained the approval of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' executive meeting. After Ambassador Debuchi to the United States returns to Japan on the 14th, he will report to Prime Minister Saitō and request his understanding. He will then seek the US government's consent for Hiroshi Saitō to serve as ambassador to the United States. Also, Ambassador Matsudaira to England will return to Japan in the spring of next year. If Matsudaira intends to resign, Yōtarō Sugimura will be appointed to succeed him. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has also decided to appoint Setsuzō Sawada, the current representative of the Japan-India trade conference in India, as the minister to Switzerland. The reasons for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to break with the past practice and appoint foreign envoys are roughly as follows: In the past, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' personnel transfers were decided based on the order of official ranks, regardless of the appropriateness of the talent. However, since Hirota took office as Foreign Minister, he believes that the current serious and extraordinary situation cannot be overcome without breaking this old practice. Therefore, he decided to select diplomatic talents from among ministers and councilors and appoint suitable ambassadors or ministers to their respective countries, so that they can use their diplomatic means and have an active base of operations. Therefore, whenever there is an opportunity in the future, the current ambassadors will be removed and replaced with new personnel. The Japanese diplomatic lineup will soon be refreshed.

<h3>Debuchi Arrives in Tokyo, Says No Problem Between Japan and the United States, Sino-Japanese Relations Calm, US-Japan Animosity Eases?</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Ambassador Debuchi to the United States arrived in Yokohama at 2:00 PM today aboard the Asama Maru and then returned to Tokyo. He told reporters who visited him that the relationship between Japan and the United States was best when Prince Takamatsu visited the United States in 1931. Later, due to the Manchurian Incident, American sentiment towards Japan deteriorated. In 1932, the outbreak of the Jinzhou and Shanghai incidents reached the worst peak. After that, the Sino-Japanese issue tended to calm down, and the construction of Manchuria gradually progressed, and the United States gradually understood, and the animosity towards Japan gradually eased. In terms of economics, more than two-thirds of Japan-US trade is almost tax-free. Therefore, although there are some difficult issues standing in the world, there is no problem between Japan and the United States. (Dentsu News Agency, 14th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Goods Sell Well in the Philippines, US Market Shaken, Overseas Chinese Boycott Movement Gradually Relaxes</h3>
<p>Manila The US cotton textile market in the Philippines is about to be taken over by Japan, because the price increase of US goods after the recovery movement, and the low exchange rate of the Japanese yen, has made the current tariff insufficient to provide protection and avoid the competition of Japanese goods. Furthermore, most of the retail industry in the Philippines is controlled by overseas Chinese. In the past two years, the import of Japanese cotton textiles has been greatly affected due to the overseas Chinese boycott of Japanese goods. Now, the trend of boycott is gradually relaxing, and the Philippine Legislative Assembly, in view of the Philippine independence case, wants to gradually seek economic independence in the Far East and does not want to offend Japan. Therefore, in the last session of the legislature, there was an attempt to increase the protective tax, but it ended without result. Therefore, US cotton textile merchants are now seeking relief from Washington. A certain trading company has telegraphed its head office, saying that if relief cannot be provided quickly, the US cotton textile market in the Philippines will be practically lost.

<h3>French Government: Financial Bill in the Senate, Salary Reduction Clauses Greatly Modified</h3>
<p>(Paris) The Senate Finance Committee met today and intensified the salary reduction for civil servants, which made the government worried. All members of the Chamber of Deputies with an annual salary of less than 12,000 francs are exempt from salary reduction. Those above this number are reduced by 2% to 7%. However, it is proposed that civil servants' salaries up to 9,000 francs be reduced by 3%, and those above 9,000 francs be reduced by 6% to 8%. It also rejected many new taxes. The committee's discussion was purely economic, not against the government. However, the government's life depends entirely on the Senate making the financial bill acceptable to the Chamber of Deputies. The Senate now also knows that it should try to avoid causing a cabinet change. Therefore, it is expected that the two houses will be able to negotiate a compromise. (Reuters, 13th)</p>

<h3>Japanese Conspiracy Against the US Exposed, Secret Propaganda to Occupy Honolulu, Chichibu Maru Carrying Seventy-Seven Boxes of Japanese Propaganda, US Customs Officials Seize and Hand Over to Naval Commander for Thorough Investigation</h3>
<p>Honolulu US customs officials today seized a large number of Japanese propaganda items of a serious nature on the Chichibu Maru, which arrived from Japan. It was found that each issue of the Japanese magazine *Hinode* in seventy-seven boxes had a booklet attached to it. Although the content was fictional, it was a detailed prediction of the 1936 Japanese-US war and the early occupation of Honolulu by the Japanese fleet. According to customs official Taule, the US government had previously seized a similar propaganda item on the Taft ship. At that time, the consignee of the goods had reported the attachment of the booklet to customs officials in advance, so it was discovered. However, it was not published because it did not want to arouse public opinion. However, prior to this incident, this booklet had already been transported to Honolulu and distributed to Japanese people. The booklet described in detail how a Japanese-American who lived in Honolulu and was disloyal to Japan was considered a spy and suffered extreme punishment. Although the book is called a novel, it uses the real names of US warships and senior officers. Therefore, this case is currently under investigation by the US naval commander. At the same time, the long-disputed issue of the loyalty of Japanese people in Honolulu has been re-examined due to the discovery of Japan's propaganda efforts. According to a recent survey, there are 139,631 Japanese people in Honolulu, only 87,748 Americans, and 49,659 foreigners. Most of these Japanese people were born in Honolulu and naturally consider themselves American citizens and should be loyal to the United States. (Guomin News Agency, 13th)</p>

<h3>US Inflationist Faction's Power Flourishes, Roosevelt's Currency Policy Reins in Progress, Fierce Battle Inevitable in Next Congress</h3>
<p>(Washington) The inflationary movement in the United States is gaining momentum. According to current indications, if the President fails to take further action to appease the inflationary faction, then an inflationary battle will be inevitable in the next Congress. However, well-informed observers of current affairs here believe that the President has reached the limit of where he is going in terms of currency and may not go any further. They fear that once Congress opens on January 3, there will be a public battle over the government's monetary policy. Senator Thomas, a Democrat from Oklahoma and leader of the inflationary faction, claimed this afternoon that he wanted to wholeheartedly support the President's currency plan in Congress, but what he said afterward confused people. Thomas continued by saying that he thought the President knew what was most beneficial to the country. He had contacted the Federal Reserve Bank and agreed with the Bank of England and the Bank of France to use the current domestic gold purchase price of the Financial Reconstruction Corporation, 34 yuan and 1 cent per ounce, as the basis for stabilizing the gold yuan, so that the gold yuan would be devalued by about 35% from its original price. If this news is true, it will trigger a currency war in Congress, because most members believe that the gold yuan should be devalued by at least 50%. As for the denial statements made by the Acting Treasury Secretary and Deputy Secretary of State yesterday, Thomas did not mention them. Therefore, observers of current affairs in the US capital believe that Thomas's promise to support the President is based on the assumption that the President will be able to take satisfactory measures for the currency when Congress reconvenes. If satisfactory measures cannot be taken at that time, the various inflationary factions may jointly propose a bill to force the government to inflate the currency. Currently, financial circles in Washington and New York hope that the White House will make a statement on the currency issue before the end of the year. However, according to well-informed sources here, if the President cannot be sure that Congress can be safely controlled, he may make a statement before the New Year that he will reuse silver as currency, in order to win over the silver faction. Also, this evening, Senator Thomas sent a draft of a bill to the White House, saying that he would submit it to Congress in January. The content authorizes the Treasury Department to confiscate all gold coins and gold in the country, and give gold certificates at the statutory gold price, except for gold used for artistic and professional purposes. Then stabilize the gold yuan and devalue it by 50%. Then, use the gold collected to cast gold bars worth 5,000 yuan each at the new gold yuan value to redeem the gold certificates. In such a transfer, the government can net purchase 50% of the gold, and it is estimated that the government's income can be about 4,325,000,000 yuan. (Guomin News Agency, 13th)</p>

<h3>Relief for Bandit Areas: Liu Xiang Requests a Large Sum</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Liu Xiang telegraphed Chiang and Wang, requesting funds to rectify rural areas affected by bandit suppression, stating that after the recovery of Yingshan and Lian'an, three-tenths of the houses were destroyed, with no complete houses in the entire city, and no tiles left in the villages. Although land was not divided, many farmers were killed. In Yingshan city alone, there were over 300 corpses. In the northwest of Lian'an, over 1,000 people were killed for resisting bandits. Approximately six or seven-tenths of able-bodied men in the county were coerced by bandits. Food supplies are only sufficient for half a month. The northern bank of the canal in Sui and Xuan counties has been recovered, with similar devastation to Yingshan and Lian'an. Besides these four counties, there are also Zhao, Guang, Jian, Lang, Cang, and Nan counties. As for the fallen areas between Tongxing and Bayi, the extent of the devastation is unknown. Roughly estimated, the funds required for reconstruction and relief are at least 5 million yuan. Please review the original proposal of the Anfu Committee and quickly allocate 5 million yuan for relief. (Special dispatch, 14th)</p>

<h3>Handling the Ammonium Sulfate Factory: Foreign Investment Plan Not Yet Abandoned</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding ammonium sulfate, the Ministry of Industry previously declared that it would no longer jointly operate with British companies due to harsh conditions, and would instead recruit merchants to handle the shares.

<h3>Public Telegram</h3>
<p>Telegram from Shashi (abridged title): Recently, a telegram was sent to the Central Executive Committee and the National Government, stating: "Unfortunately, our country is suffering from repeated disasters. It is being invaded by strong enemies from the outside and harassed by red bandits from the inside. The nation and the people are at a time of crisis. At this time, it is appropriate to unite sincerely to save the country. However, Chen Mingshu, Li Jishen, and others suddenly caused chaos in Fujian at this critical moment, betraying the party and the country, colluding with red bandits internally and colluding with a certain country externally. Their intention is to put the nation and the people to death. This is truly a sinner of the country and a public enemy of the people. The people of Xing Sha are filled with grief and indignation after hearing this. We earnestly request the committee to make a decisive decision and issue a clear order to suppress them to uphold the law and stabilize the foundation of the country." We hope that everyone will unanimously advocate and condemn them by telegram. Sincerely, the Representatives of All Circles in Jing Sha Anti-Rebellion Assembly.</p>
<h3>Fujian Side Compromises with Bandits: =Zhu De and Cai Tingkai Join Hands= =Decision to Send Troops to Attack Zhejiang=</h3>
<p>Fuzhou Communication: Chen Mingshu organized the so-called People's Government in Fujian and implemented the land revolution policy. Because of his compromise with the Communist bandits, the Third International also considered it very important and agreed to send Miff (former Deputy Chief of Moscow Sun Yat-sen University) to China to preside over it. It is now learned that the compromise conditions between the Fujian rebels and the Communist bandits are as follows: (1) Jointly resist the Central Government and abolish the Kuomintang; (2) Implement equal distribution of land; (3) Establish a bourgeois alliance regime of workers and peasants. The start of the implementation conditions, one, in order to avoid too large a target, stop blocking the Red Zone, two, in order to avoid too large a target, temporarily express gray as much as possible within the possible scope, and the two sides only implement liaison in secret, three, the Communist bandits are the barrier for the 19th Route Army in the northern Fujian area to resist the Central Army, four, Chen Cai, etc. give up western Fujian, and the Communist bandit Luo Binghui takes over the defense of Longyan, in order to contain Guangdong, and the 49th Division Zhang Yan unit will be transferred to Zhang Xia, and the Mao district troops stationed in Zhangquan will be transferred to northern Fujian to prepare for the attack on Zhejiang.</p>
<p>Another report: When the Fujian mutiny was launched, the Communist bandits sent Peng De's wife and Luo Binghui to Fuzhou to negotiate everything. After the establishment of the pseudo-government, 50 people were sent from the Jiangxi bandit area to participate in the various pseudo-agencies. Many Communist Party members who went to Fujian from Shanghai also participated. Recently, Zhu De arrived in the province and held joint meetings with Cai repeatedly. Zhu advocated joining forces to attack the north, while Cai advocated returning to the south. They held each other very strongly. Finally, they followed Zhu De's suggestion and decided to attack Zhejiang. The first army was concurrently led by Cai Tingkai, and the second army was led by Zhu De. From then on, the 19th Route Army began to unite with the Red Bandits. On the 20th of last month and the 2nd of this month, about two regiments of Red Bandits left Jiangle for Yanping. On the 3rd, the 60th and 61st divisions of the rebel army, together with about 2,000 Red Bandits, left Yanping to Sandukou and moved to Gutian via Boshan Dubei. Also, about 2,000 Red Bandits and rebel troops arrived at places such as Xiadaohu Hengshan Qingfengling and moved to Gutian. (Central News Agency)</p>
<h3>Guangdong Province: Chaozhou and Meizhou Seven Districts Divided into Martial Law Zone</h3>
<p>-Eastern Guangdong Border Divided into Three Defense Lines- Guangzhou Communication: Since the Fujian Mutiny occurred, the eastern Guangdong border defense has become increasingly serious. Chen Jitang has recently successively increased and transferred large armies to defend the Chaozhou, Meizhou, and Hui areas, and on the 11th of this month, he ordered the front-line troops to announce martial law by a certain date. Unless an order is received from the General Headquarters of the First Army Corps, no troops from any army corps are allowed to enter Guangdong territory. If anyone dares to violate this order, they will be met with a head-on attack, and a telegram was sent to the troops stationed in western Fujian to shorten the defense line. Therefore, the First Independent Division, Huang Renhuan's unit, has recently returned to the Jiaoling and Pingyuan areas, and the seven districts of Chao'an, Raoping, Meixian, Dabu, Jiaoling, Pingyuan, and Xingning have been designated as martial law zones. It was suddenly reported that the 19th Route Army was discovered in the Pinghe and Yongding areas of western Fujian, with a force of more than two divisions, and there was a trend of moving south. One theory is that it is Luo Binghui's unit of more than 10,000 Communist bandits, with Peng Dehuai, Wei Binghui, and a certain army commander among them. All food and military equipment are supplied by Fujian Province. Strange slogans and catchphrases have been posted all over the Yongding area, causing great panic in the border counties of Raoping and Dabu in Guangdong. The wealthy have mostly fled, and the residents of Dongjiang are wary. Guangdong troops have been continuously deployed to the border in recent days. The Fifth Air Force Team stationed in Meixian has been ordered to fly to the Fujian-Guangdong border area to conduct reconnaissance. The military authorities here, in addition to ordering the front-line Third Army Commander Li Yangjing, the First Independent Division Commander Huang Renhuan, and the Second Independent Division Commander Zhang Ruigui to step up their defenses, have been sending secret telegrams to the front every night to inquire about news. Yesterday, the Dongjiang border was divided into three defense lines, with Jiaoling, Pingyuan, Dabu, and Sanheba as the first defense line, Chao'an, Jieyang, Xingning, and Fengshun as the second defense line, and Wuhua, Laolong, Heyuan, and Huizhou as the third defense line. New-style trenches have been built in the first defense line from Jiaoling and Pingyuan in the west to Raoping and Sanheba in the east, designed and built by German military advisors. Yang Youmin, Chief of Staff of the East District Pacification Office, was appointed as the trench defense commissioner, responsible for arranging all trench defense works. Regarding the transmission of military information, active preparations are also being made. The General Headquarters of the First Army Corps believes that with the concentration of troops in Dongjiang, each regiment should have at least one communication station to facilitate the use of military equipment. Yesterday, it ordered the addition of ten sets of telecommunications stations, with a budget of 600 yuan per set, to be established by the end of this month and to work with the army. Also, in view of the current tight situation in eastern Guangdong, in order to consolidate the rear, it has ordered the First Army, Yu Hanmou's unit, stationed in southern Jiangxi, to depart from Ganzhou and Shangyou on the 11th of this month and move back to northern Guangdong. The defense areas of Shangyou and Chongyi will be taken over by the Xiang Army, Chen Guangzhong's division, and the areas of Ganzhou and Nankang will be taken over by the Xiang Army, Wang Dongyuan's division. It is estimated that the Xiang Army will be able to arrive and fill the defenses before the 15th. The First Division and the Second Independent Brigade of the First Army will temporarily return to Longnan, Yinan, and Yunan after withdrawing from Ganzhou and Shangyou, to support the northeastern Guangdong armies, while the First Army Headquarters will temporarily move to Xinfeng to command everything.

<h3>Jiangxi Bandits Flee to Fujian Border: =Progress of the Encirclement and Suppression of a Certain Route Army= =And Building Blockhouses to Restrain Bandit Activities=</h3>
<p>Nanchang Communication: After the Fujian Mutiny, the Red Bandits roamed around eastern Jiangxi, trying to achieve their ambitions. However, Chairman Chiang did not relax the suppression of the bandits at all, as the Fujian army and the Red Bandits were both east of the Jiangxi-Guangdong defense line. For example, the pseudo-1st Army Corps scattered in the junction of Nanfeng and Yihuang, the pseudo-35th Army Corps hiding between Lichuan and Nancheng, and the pseudo-7th Army Corps appearing in Jinxi and Zixi were all attacked by the army. On the 3rd of this month, a certain route army captured Gongcunying and advanced to the southwest of Lichuan on the 3rd, completely defeating Zhong Xian's pseudo-15th Division and Heyuanying's pseudo-3rd Division, and recovered Zhongxian town. Most of the remaining bandits fled to Hejiazhuan. Lichuan County can be recovered soon. It is reported that because the bandits are under pressure from the Northern Route Army, they are mostly fleeing to the northeast, with a complete trend of retreating into Fujian territory. According to military sources, the central government is currently focusing on advancing into the Jiangxi-Fujian border to eliminate the banditry in eastern Jiangxi, while temporarily focusing on defending the Jiangxi-Zhejiang-Fujian border.</p>
<p>In addition to suppressing the bandits by land, Chiang is also building blockhouses to prevent the bandits from committing crimes again. The only trick of the bandits is to bypass the rear of the national army and launch sneak attacks, so blockhouses are used to restrain the bandits. The General Headquarters has also designated more than 20 counties, including Linchuan and Qingjiang, as blockhouse cluster areas in order to quickly clear the scattered bandits within the blockade line of the eastern Jiangxi River and strictly prevent the red bandits from outside the blockade line from entering. All blockhouses in cities, towns, villages, and transportation hubs are equipped with garrisons, and a firm wall and clear fields are strictly implemented outside the defense line to prevent bandit activities.

<h3>Jiangsu Provincial Department of Finance Revises Budget:</h3>
<p>Deficit of Over Two Million Listed as Debt Zhenjiang Communication: The accumulation of financial deficits in Jiangsu Province is deep, and the abolition of the additional two yuan per stone of winter grain has resulted in a shortfall of two to three million yuan per year, making it even more exhausted. The establishment of the current provincial government was more than three months after the start of the year, and the budget for the 22nd year has not yet been established. It has been decided by the provincial government committee to compile the general budget for the 22nd year based on the principle of full income and expenditure. After offsetting income and expenditure, there is a deficit of more than 7.12 million yuan. After the various departments and offices have reduced the expenditure part as much as possible and tried to increase the income part, the budget has been revised, and the final decision has been passed by the 618th provincial government committee meeting on the 13th. The deficit has been reduced to 2,782,651 yuan, which is listed as debt income and ways are being sought to make up for it. Assuming that the additional grain has not been abolished, the income and expenditure can be offset as much as possible. It is reported that all the provincial government committees opened their hearts and discussed together before the event, so the number of deficits could be reduced by 4 million yuan. The province's finances have gradually returned to the right track this year. If they can be gradually promoted, the future of Jiangsu Province's finances can be expected to be optimistic. In the budget, the various income and expenditure items have been converted into percentages. Among the expenditure items, education and cultural expenses account for the most, accounting for more than 20% of the total, followed by debt service fees, accounting for 18%, and public security construction fees, accounting for 15%. Financial expenses account for the least, accounting for 3.3%. Among the income items, land tax accounts for the largest proportion, accounting for more than 48% of the total, followed by business tax, accounting for 27%. (14th)</p>
<h3>Songjiang: Police Team Seizes Suspicious Boat</h3>
<p>Since the Yu surname was robbed outside the east gate of this city, the county government ordered a police team to be stationed at Dongshi Temple to patrol the land and water to ensure local safety. However, last night (the 13th) at about 10 p.m., a suspicious awning boat was sailing from Maojing through Huayang Bridge, and the local police station ordered it to be checked. The boat answered that it was a patrol boat from the anti-smuggling camp and was released. However, the answer in the boat seemed to be in a Jiangbei accent, which raised suspicion. The police station immediately telegraphed the police team in Shi Temple and asked them to check the incoming boat. When Team Leader Li led the team to the site and questioned the incoming boat, they saw that the three people in the boat looked flustered and spoke evasively. They searched the boat and one person jumped ashore and fled. A revolver and an iron bar were found. The interrogated named Dang Jigao, from Shandong, and Yin Anlin, from Yancheng. They are currently serving in the anti-smuggling patrol team and have been dismissed. The rest of the confession evaded. Team Leader Li immediately sent the two suspects, Yin and his surname, one boat, a revolver, an iron bar and several bags of rice in the boat to the police team headquarters for investigation.</p>
<h3>Suzhou: Vegetable Market Dispute Comes to an End</h3>
<p>The vegetable market dispute in Xiliku, Suzhou City, where vegetable tax contractors and vegetable vendors refused to give in to each other, has been unresolved for three months. Now, Shi Junqing, chairman of the county chamber of commerce, has taken on the role of mediator and invited representatives from the Yangyu Lane stores and vegetable vendors, Ye Yinpin and Zhang Zhiming, etc., and also joined the town chiefs of Taiping Road and Yangzhen to hold a meeting to discuss a compromise solution. It was agreed that in order to take care of the business of the stores, a road should be opened in the Qian surname house in Jiliqiao to directly reach the vegetable market to facilitate the people. Before the road is opened, the vegetable vendors will continue to operate at the original location and will not move into the vegetable market for the time being, but the vegetable tax will be paid as usual. The county government has also formulated standards for stalls and prices, which were submitted to the county political meeting for approval yesterday (the 14th). It seems that this case can now come to an end and can be resolved within three days.</p>
<h3>Wuxi: Widening Sanxiatang Achieved on Schedule</h3>
<p>The case of widening Sanxiatang Main Street in this county has been actively carried out by County Magistrate Yan, and after stipulating the scale and deadline for demolition, some residents have voluntarily demolished their houses. However, a few residents are ignorant and still trying to obstruct it, and have petitioned various party and government agencies, but to no avail. The details have been recorded in this newspaper. It is now learned that after the failure of the few residents of this road to petition in Wuxi, Tang Ziming, Hua Shenbo, and others jointly submitted a petition to the Department of Construction, claiming that the county government's plan to widen Sanxiatang Street was ill-conceived and harmful to people's livelihood, and requested that the department order a change of the main road, re-plan it, and avoid a sudden widening. They also elected three representatives, Tao Maojun and others, to go to the province to petition the Department of Construction. Director Shen believed that Sanxiatang Main Street in the county was a major north-south thoroughfare in the urban area, with frequent traffic of vehicles and pedestrians. The original street was too narrow, so it was necessary to widen it immediately. He also checked the original plan and found that the demolition of the houses on both sides was average. The houses that each household should demolish were not consistent with what was claimed in the petition, such as making the people homeless. The request could not be approved and was rejected by the approval. The representatives returned one after another because they could not get what they wanted. At the same time, the Department of Construction also instructed County Magistrate Yan to actively implement the original plan and achieve it as scheduled. After receiving the order, County Magistrate Yan has been supervising his subordinates to actively carry it out so that it can be achieved as scheduled.</p>

<h3>Local News Ministry of Finance Instructs All Customs Houses to Levy Tax on Foreign Rice and Wheat Tomorrow Temporary Suspension of Collection in Fujian, Guangdong, and Guangxi Provinces</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the flour industry held an emergency meeting. According to a Shen Shi News Agency report from this city, the central government, in order to alleviate the hardships of farmers and revive the rural economy, has instructed all customs houses across the country (except for those in Fujian, Guangdong, and Guangxi) to levy import taxes on rice and wheat starting from the 16th. The Shen Shi News Agency reporter has obtained the full text of the Ministry of Finance's instructions from financial circles, as well as information on the situation after the tax collection, and will continue to report as follows:</p>
<h3>Original Texts of Two Instructions from the Ministry of Finance</h3>
<p>(1) The Ministry of Finance issued an instruction to the Superintendent and Customs Commissioner of the Jianghai Customs, stating: "Regarding the matter of various organizations nationwide requesting the collection of import taxes on foreign rice to protect farmers' livelihoods and revive the rural economy, the Ministry has investigated and found it feasible. This matter has been submitted to the Executive Yuan, which has been forwarded to the Legislative Yuan for deliberation, stipulating a maximum tax rate of 2.50 gold units per dan for foreign rice and 1.50 gold units per dan for grain. The Ministry will further deliberate and formulate detailed collection rules and submit a report. The Ministry has now decided to collect 1.00 gold unit per dan for foreign rice and 0.50 gold unit per dan for grain, and has issued a general order to all customs houses nationwide to uniformly collect the tax. As for rice and grain imported through the customs of Yuehai, Chaohai, Qionghai, Wuzhou, Longzhou, Nanning, Xiamen, and Minhai, due to the local food supply situation, the collection will be temporarily suspended. For all other provinces' customs houses, starting from December 16th of this year, imported rice and grain should be taxed in accordance with the established tax rates. Imported rice and grain transferred to Shanghai from the aforementioned areas where the tax is not being collected should also be subject to import tax at the port of arrival. This order is issued for compliance, in addition to separate orders and submissions to the authorities." (2) The Ministry of Finance issued an instruction to the Superintendent and Customs Commissioner of the Jianghai Customs regarding the collection of import taxes on foreign wheat, flour, and miscellaneous grains, stating: "Regarding the collection of import taxes on foreign wheat, flour, and miscellaneous grains, the Ministry previously received an order from the Executive Yuan stating that the Legislative Yuan had resolved that customs duties should be levied on imported foreign wheat and that customs duties on flour should be increased, with tax rates to be adjusted as appropriate. The maximum tax rate for foreign wheat is 1.25 gold units per dan (old system of 100 catties equals 60.5 kilograms of customs weight), and the minimum is tax-free. The maximum tax rate for flour is 2.50 gold units per dan, and the minimum is tax-free. It is requested that tax rates be formulated as soon as possible and submitted for approval and implementation. The Ministry has consulted on the wholesale prices of wheat and flour, considering the proportional relationship between the two items, and has stipulated the following tax rates within the scope of the tax rates resolved by the Legislative Yuan: an import tax of 0.30 gold units per dan for imported wheat and an import tax of 0.75 gold units per dan for flour. In addition, imported barley, buckwheat, corn, millet, rye, and other miscellaneous grains should all be taxed at 10% ad valorem. All of the above should be taxed uniformly starting from the 16th of this month. This order is issued for compliance, in addition to separate orders and submissions to the authorities."</p>
<h3>Rice and Grain Tax Increases Market Prices</h3>
<p>After the collection of import taxes, it is expected that market prices will rise, and the rural economy will be revitalized. However, according to the reporter's investigation from various sources, there may not be significant changes in the short term. The reasons are: (1) The tax on grain has been rumored for a long time, and those familiar with the situation generally believe that although the tax may not be implemented immediately, it is only a matter of time. Therefore, rice merchants with strong capital have already stockpiled large quantities of grain, hoping to make a large profit after the tax is collected. However, consumer demand remains the same and cannot be manipulated in the short term. According to a Shen Shi News Agency reporter's investigation, the city has approximately 100,000 dan of indica rice and more than 200,000 dan of japonica rice in stock, which is enough for one month's consumption. Therefore, the price of rice is unlikely to be affected much in the coming weeks. (2) There is still a large amount of grain stockpiled inland, which can be purchased in large quantities at any time to stabilize market prices. According to general observations, there may be more drastic changes after March or April next year. However, if market prices are higher than the value of foreign rice, foreign rice can be imported again, causing prices to fall back to previous levels. In this way, market prices can be kept stable.</p>
<h3>Emergency Meeting of Flour Mill Industry</h3>
<p>The industry most affected by this tax collection is the local flour industry, such as Fufeng, Fuxin, and Xinda. They have previously ordered American wheat from the United States, with more than 11 ships on the way. Each ship carries 7,500 tons, totaling 82,500 tons. Now it is stipulated that an import tax of 0.30 gold units per dan of wheat (approximately equivalent to 56.7 cents in national currency) will be levied, and the total tax will be around 800,000 yuan. During this period of business decline, how can they bear such a burden? After the Jianghai Customs announced the tax rates yesterday, the Flour Mill Industry Association held an emergency meeting at its association's location on Xin Kaihe at 4:00 PM yesterday. More than a dozen representatives from various factories attended and unanimously decided to send a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, which would then be forwarded to the Executive Yuan, Ministry of Finance, Tax Bureau, and Customs Administration, requesting that the tax on foreign wheat that has already been ordered and has not yet arrived before the announcement of the tax rate be waived in order to maintain the flour industry.</p>
<h3>Rice and Wheat Tax Increases National Revenue</h3>
<p>After the tax collection, there should be a considerable increase in national revenue. However, the tax rate on foreign rice is approximately 3 yuan in national currency per shi (150 catties), and the tax on wheat flour is approximately 1 yuan and 40 cents per shi, which is a large difference from domestic products. It will be difficult to import them in the future. The intention is to protect domestic farmers and workers, and the purpose is not tax revenue. However, wheat is a necessary raw material for various factories. Domestic wheat is only sufficient to maintain production for four months, and the rest must rely on foreign wheat. Based on last year's situation, the import of wheat was 15 million dan, worth more than 43 million silver dollars. At 50 cents in national currency per dan, this could increase revenue by more than 7.5 million yuan.</p>
<h3>Temporary Suspension in Fujian, Guangdong, and Guangxi</h3>
<p>The Shen Shi News Agency reporter has learned that the exemption of import taxes on rice and grain in Fujian, Guangdong, and Guangxi provinces is confirmed. Now, looking at the full text of the Ministry of Finance's instructions, the customs of Yuehai, Chaohai, Qionghai, Wuzhou, Longzhou, Nanning, Xiamen, and Minhai will be temporarily exempted from tax collection. This statement has become a reality. Some people speculate that this may be related to the current political situation, but according to the reporter's investigation, this speculation is completely wrong. There seem to be other unavoidable reasons for the exclusion of the three provinces. When necessary, the tax collection will be ordered at any time and has nothing to do with the political situation. Moreover, the provinces of Fujian and Guangdong have already collected consolidated taxes, and based on the current market price of foreign rice, it may not be able to circulate smoothly.</p>
<h3>Philippine Vice Governor Huntington Scheduled to Arrive in Shanghai Arriving by Ship from the Philippines on the 18th of this Month</h3>
<p>The Michigan Club Hosts a Banquet to Welcome According to the Xinxin News Agency, Philippine Vice Governor Dr. Huntington and his wife are scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on the President Hoover on the 18th of this month (next Monday). They are expected to arrive at the port at 1:30 PM. In the afternoon of the same day at 8:00 PM, the Michigan Club of this city plans to host a banquet for the Huntingtons at the Bank Club at No. 4 Hong Kong Road, inviting many prominent Chinese and American figures.

In addition to politics, Huntington also has special research on the Philippine Islands. His recent book, "Philippine Islands Work," (compiled by Wang Xisi) is famous in Europe and America. Dr. Huntington is also a talented speaker and has served as chairman of political science societies at Williams College and other institutions multiple times. It is also said that the Shanghai Michigan Alumni Association, led by Ke Ninghan and Wang Zhengting, will also host a banquet for the Huntingtons at a scheduled time.</p>
<h3>Yin Tong Returned to Beijing Last Night</h3>
<p>Staying in Beijing for a short time before returning north. Yin Tong, director of the Beining Railway Bureau, came to Shanghai the day before yesterday to meet with Railway Minister Gu Mengyu to report on the railway situation and the issue of traffic. Yesterday morning, Yin drove to meet Gu again and discussed for a long time. Yin returned to Beijing by the 11:00 PM night train last night. He will consult with Executive Yuan President Wang Jingwei several times before returning north to report his orders.</p>
<h3>To Fujian Foreign Ships No Longer Subject to Inspection</h3>
<p>Food Can Also Be Shipped Previously, in order to blockade the Fujian coast, the central government first banned Chinese ships from docking at Fuzhou ports, and then sent naval forces to Sandu Ao to search foreign merchant ships. This has been reported in this newspaper several times. This newspaper's reporter has now received confirmation that the search of foreign ships has been stopped, and that food can also be shipped to Fujian.</p>
<h3>Search Stopped</h3>
<p>Last month, the British Jardine Matheson's Hengsheng Wheel sailed from Hong Kong to Fuzhou and then came to Shanghai. When entering and leaving the port, the Navy's Yixian warship sent officers and soldiers on board to conduct strict inspections. Passengers and cargo were all searched. After this incident occurred, the Jardine Matheson authorities telegraphed the British Consulate in Beijing to discuss the cessation of the search with our Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The British merchants also guaranteed that they would not load any military equipment or other items for transport into Fuzhou, but at the same time requested that the naval vessels stationed at the Fujian coastal ports no longer conduct searches to avoid delaying the voyage and disturbing passengers. The central government has accepted the British Consulate's request and has notified all warships in Sandu Ao that they will immediately cease the search of foreign ships.</p>
<h3>Unimpeded Traffic</h3>
<p>The Jiesheng Steamboat can travel freely to and from Shanghai and Fujian. The navy did not inspect it, and there were no obstacles at the Fujian coastal ports, so traffic is unimpeded. However, because all Chinese ships have suspended operations, Fujian goods are transported and loaded as usual, so the volume of goods imported and exported by the Jiesheng Wheel has suddenly increased, and both passengers and cargo are full. The company and the comprador have made huge profits.</p>
<h3>Food Can Be Shipped</h3>
<p>The central government had previously issued an order prohibiting Chinese ships from sailing to Fujian to cut off their water transport, and also prohibiting the shipment of food to Fujian to supply the military. However, the people of Fujian have always needed food, which is mostly transported from Shanghai. If transport is cut off, the people's food supply will be in panic. Therefore, the Jianghai Customs did not issue a ban on the transport of food to Fujian. Last Tuesday, a large amount of white rice and flour purchased in Shanghai by the Fuzhou community, totaling two thousand several hundred tons, has already been shipped. A telegram was received yesterday stating that it had arrived safely in Fuzhou and is currently being unloaded.</p>
<h3>Baifu and Other Three Lanes Water Cutoff Dispute Water Company and Tenants Both Sue Landlord</h3>
<p>Taxpayers Association Sends Letter to the Public Works Bureau Urging Swift Resolution According to Guowen News Agency, the British Shanghai Waterworks Company, due to its failure to increase prices, cut off the water pipes of Delley Company, the landlord of Baifu and other three lanes on Pingliang Road in the Eastern District. Because the Waterworks Company has set a deadline for payment of water bills, and the tenants have filed a lawsuit demanding compensation for all direct and indirect losses caused by the water cutoff, the landlord is actually forced into this situation. Therefore, yesterday, it sent separate letters to the Shanghai Concession Taxpayers Association of Chinese Nationals and the Shanghai Real Estate Association, requesting that they forward letters to the Public Works Bureau and warn the Waterworks Company that it should bear full responsibility for all direct and indirect losses caused by the water cutoff. The various reports are recorded separately below.</p>
<h3>Landlord Appeals</h3>
<p>Delley Company sent letters to the Shanghai Concession Taxpayers Association of Chinese Nationals and the Shanghai Real Estate Association, stating: "We are writing to inform you that our company owns more than 200 buildings in Baifu Lane, Balu Lane, and Bashou Lane between Pingliang Road, Huasheng Road, Yangzhou Road, and Fenzhou Road in the Eastern District, housing no fewer than 3,000 residents. Recently, the Shanghai Waterworks Company suddenly cut off the water pipes due to its failure to increase prices, causing panic among the residents of the three lanes, which has lasted for several weeks. Moreover, the water volume of the fire hydrants is insufficient, the supply is out of balance, and there have been several disputes. While the residents are suffering and unable to find a solution, the Waterworks Company, relying on the support of the Public Works Bureau and its threatening power, on the 4th of this month at around 2:00 PM, went even further and dared to send craftsmen to cut off the iron pipes of the fire hydrants inside the lanes, which our company had installed at its own expense for emergencies. At the same time, the fire hydrants on the roadside were also closed. More than 3,000 residents had no water at all, which not only endangered their lives but also risked major unfortunate events if a fire were to occur due to carelessness. The residents of the three lanes, because people cannot live without water and fire, felt the pain deeply. Therefore, they immediately sent dozens of representatives to our company to demand water, and the situation was serious, almost out of control. On the one hand, fortunately, the residents knew how to obey the law and listened to persuasion, maintaining the original order. On the other hand, they sought a final solution from the Public Works Bureau. We instructed Mr. Li Songquan to invite Mr. Zhu Kuaiyanfang to go to the Public Works Bureau together. Executive Officer He led them to meet Director-General Zhong Sijun. After an hour of repeated discussions, Director Zhong only relied on the Waterworks Company's one-sided statements and disregarded the interests and lives of the taxpayers. Although they spoke until their tongues were dry, they were not accepted. Our company saw that the governing body was still held hostage by the Waterworks Company and could do nothing. If we were to negotiate directly with the Waterworks Company again, it would be like seeking skin from a tiger. However, in this state of being unable to appeal, we could not bear to sit idly by and watch more than 3,000 residents suffer from the water cutoff. If we did not seek self-help, we would not be able to survive. Therefore, we first hired workers to fetch water to help the lives of the residents, on the one hand, to fight for the dignity of the landlord and reduce the burden on the users, and we will never recognize the Waterworks Company's price increase oppression. On the other hand, for public safety and a permanent solution, we have been working overnight to dig artesian wells to avoid being controlled by the Waterworks Company again. Therefore, although we have suffered great sacrifices, we do not regret it. What our company regrets is that this matter has been going on for some time, and the Public Works Bureau not only does not provide legal mediation to help the citizens in distress, but also allows the Waterworks Company to cut off the water pipes of the users and allows it to cut off the fire hydrants inside the lanes, which are important fire-fighting equipment, and the fire hydrants on the roadside are also closed, without stopping it. In terms of its duties, it is inevitably a waste of resources. The Public Works Bureau is one of the autonomous bodies of the city. It should provide equal protection to all taxpayers without any bias. However, the rulers of the Public Works Bureau treat the Waterworks Company as if it were owned by foreign merchants, as if it were a divinely privileged son. Even if there are transgressions, they can be tolerated and concealed without interference. However, our taxpayers, now with the infringement of the legal rights of thousands of people, are making legitimate demands and are being rejected. According to the law, this is also improper. Therefore, we have provided a detailed account of the process and negotiations, and we urge your association to send a letter to the Public Works Bureau as soon as possible to inform them and warn the Waterworks Company that our company should bear full responsibility for all direct and indirect losses suffered by the Waterworks Company due to its intentional harmful behavior. We are sending this letter to you for investigation and handling separately."</p>
<h3>Letter to Public Works Bureau</h3>
<p>After receiving the letter, the Shanghai Concession Taxpayers Association of Chinese Nationals immediately forwarded a letter to the Director-General of the Public Concession Public Works Bureau, stating: "We are writing to inform you that the Delley Company's letter stated (original letter omitted above) and other information. The waterworks issue is extremely complex because it relates to the lives of citizens and the economic capabilities of individual users, and because the payer and the user are not the same person. It is difficult to solve without a long-term in-depth study. If water cutoff can be used to solve this extremely complex problem, then the special meeting in 1920, the Hill report that followed, and the discount methods before April of this year, as well as the large discount actions this time, are all redundant. If the principle of not increasing fees for meter installation is destroyed, the Waterworks Company will indeed be economically very prosperous, while the living burden of the citizens will be unsustainable. Our association cannot ignore this, and your bureau's prompt solution is also incumbent upon you. However, the Waterworks Company has repeatedly used water cutoff procedures, disregarding the safety of citizens' lives, and your bureau has also failed to come up with a solution. How can you console the taxpayers? Seeing that the Waterworks Company has twice been willing to automatically reduce water fees, it can be proved that the owners' refusal to pay the price increase is not without reason. If the Waterworks Company does not use cooperative and peaceful means to seek a solution, but instead carries out repeated water cutoff actions to trap the users' lives in desperation, it is difficult to escape responsibility. The Delley Company's wording may be too excessive, but under heavy pressure, its urgency may be unavoidable. In general, we hope that your bureau will quickly handle it properly so that the principle of not increasing fees for meter installation will not be destroyed by the Waterworks Company again. This is a blessing for the public. We are writing this letter to inform you of the situation and hope that you will investigate and handle it accordingly."</p>
<h3>Real Estate Association Letter</h3>
<p>After receiving the letter, the Shanghai Real Estate Association, in addition to sending a letter to the Public Works Bureau, also replied to Delley's accounting office, stating: "We are replying to your letter of December 12, which stated that the Waterworks Company should bear full responsibility for all losses caused by the water cutoff, and requested that we send a letter to the Public Concession Public Works Bureau to inform the Waterworks Company. We have received all the information. Your active efforts this time and the users' willingness to endure suffering, not succumbing to the Waterworks Company's high-pressure tactics of water cutoff, fighting for the dignity of the landlord and reducing the burden on the users, are truly righteous and have contributed to society, and are admired by the public. We have now heard that the Waterworks Company has a new method of large discounts, which may not be the success of this struggle. If the industry and users are as consistent as your office and the users who have suffered greatly, why worry that the public's interests will be exclusively seized by the Waterworks Company using the high-pressure tactics of water cutoff? In addition to sending a letter to the Public Works Bureau according to the situation, we are also replying to you for your information."</p>
<h3>Company Demands Payment</h3>
<p>The British Shanghai Waterworks Company, because the landlord Delley Company has already dug its own artesian wells and severed its business relationship, yesterday specifically ordered Delley Company to pay off all outstanding water bills within three days, otherwise it will be sued according to law.</p>
<h3>Tenants Sue</h3>
<p>Tenants in Baifu, Balu, and Bashou Lanes on Pingliang Road, because the landlord Delley Company refused to pay the water bills, causing the sub-landlords and tenants of 209 buildings to have their water cut off by the Waterworks Company twice, directly causing each household to spend money to buy water, and indirectly causing the tenants to move out one after another, and their losses were huge. Therefore, they have hired a lawyer and officially filed a lawsuit in the Shanghai Special District First District Court, demanding that the landlord compensate for various losses. The court, according to the complaint, has scheduled a trial for the 19th and has already served the summons on Delley Company, the landlord. It is said that the company has also hired a lawyer to respond, and there will be a fierce debate at that time.</p>
<h3>Japan Actively Pursuing Economic Aggression Policy Opening Up Markets in Yunnan, Sichuan, and Other Provinces</h3>
<p>Planned by Japanese Commercial Attaché Yokotake According to Xinxin News Agency, recently, the anti-Japanese sentiment of the Chinese people has gradually subsided, resulting in a sudden improvement in the sales of Japanese goods in China. Japanese Commercial Attaché Yokotake, seeing this good opportunity, believes that it is a good time to implement an economic aggression policy. Therefore, he submitted a request to the Japanese government, suggesting the opening up of new trade markets in Yunnan, Sichuan, and Northwest provinces. The Xinxin News Agency reporter has learned from reliable sources that the content of Yokotake's plan includes the following three points: (1) Establishing additional commercial agencies in Yunnan, Sichuan, and Northwest provinces to manage trade affairs in those provinces; (2) Having the Textile Federation in China establish large-scale yarn factories in the aforementioned areas; (3) Having the government allocate funds to subsidize Japanese merchants in the aforementioned areas to expand their business scope. It is said that this plan has been agreed to by a majority of the Japanese government and public, and will be actively implemented as soon as the situation in the aforementioned areas is investigated.</p>
<h3>Li Shizeng Visited Wu Tiecheng Yesterday Said to Be About Cultural and Educational Matters</h3>
<p>Not Related to the Fourth Plenary Session According to the Xinsheng News Agency, Central Committee member Li Shizeng visited Mayor Wu Tiecheng at the Municipal Government at 11:30 AM yesterday, and they talked for less than an hour. He left at 12:20 PM. Later, Li told the Xinsheng News Agency reporter that his visit to Mayor Wu was to discuss cultural and educational matters and was not related to the Fourth Plenary Session. It is still unknown whether the Central Committee members staying in Shanghai will telegram all members to enter Beijing. I am not responsible for contacting the members. I have not seen Li Xiehe for a long time. Although I have been visiting Zhang Jingjiang from time to time in recent days, this is only a private conversation, because Zhang visits Yu Cheng every day. Executive Yuan President Wang has already expressed his views on the Fujian issue, and I have no need to say more. As for the telegram from the Southwest requesting that the responsible persons of the military and political authorities leave, I do not know because I have not seen the original telegram. I have not prepared a proposal for the Fourth Plenary Session, and I can raise my opinions directly orally at that time, etc.</p>

<h3>National Coal Relief Association Held Routine Meeting the Day Before Yesterday Formulated Specific Relief Plan Integrated Opinions from Various Coal Mines</h3>
<p>Submitted to Competent Ministries for Adoption and Implementation The National Coal Relief Association held its sixth routine meeting the day before yesterday, chaired by Chairman Zhao Jinqing. He first reported on the progress of important cases handled this year: (1) Requesting the cancellation of coal inspection; (2) Forwarding the exemption of the temporary subsidy fee for coal in Shandong Province; (3) Investigating the production, sales, and transportation of coal; (4) Publishing a special issue. Next, the opinions of various coal mines on relieving the national coal industry were discussed. After detailed discussion, it was decided that the association would formulate a specific plan and submit it to the competent ministries of the central government for adoption and implementation. The opinions of various coal mines are recorded separately below.</p>
<h3>Transportation Costs Too High</h3>
<p>Reports and opinions submitted by various mines, such as (Hua Feng Heji Coal Mine): The car transfer fee for each ton of coal from Qiyao Station to Nanyi on the Jinpu Railway is 12.5 cents, and the railway should be requested to waive it. (Liuhegou): Railway transportation costs are higher than transporting coal from Fushun and Kailuan to Hankou, and a reduction should be requested. (Tongbao): The Lianfeng Road transportation fee is too high, at 9 cents per kilometer. It is proposed to formulate transportation fee regulations to reduce transportation fees for coal mines that are far from the coast. (Jiangxi Pingxiang Coal Mine): From Anyuan to Zhuzhou, 190 li, coal is 2.52 yuan per ton, and coke is 3.28 yuan per ton. From Anyuan to Changsha, 280 li, coal is 2.8 yuan per ton, and coke is 3.7 yuan per ton. From Anyuan to Yuyutao, more than 1,000 li, coal is 4.6 yuan per ton, and coke is 6.04 yuan per ton. The Ministry of Railways should be requested to reduce transportation costs. (Yili): Loading and unloading fees at various stations have increased from 1 cent to 3 cents. Car transfer fees and other unexpected expenses should be reduced or waived. Wharf fees and other donations amount to several cents per ton and should be investigated and reduced or waived. The Pinghan Railway treats various mines much higher than the Jinpu Railway, and it does not seem possible to develop freely without reducing the charges as much as possible.</p>
<h3>Improvement of Transportation</h3>
<p>Various coal mines request improved transportation. (Hua Feng) The Pukou railway requires over one million yuan for the construction of branch lines and wharves, which should be undertaken by the Railway Management Committee or through the issuance of public bonds. During the winter and spring rainy seasons, coal transportation should be handled by two trains designated by the Transportation Department. (Bao Heng) A proposal has been made to construct a 19-li branch line from the mine to Kouquan to reduce costs. (Jinbei Mining Bureau) (1) Vehicle numbers decrease during the peak season for coal sales in winter; (2) There is a shortage of 5% of coal along the route from Kouquan to Tanggu, all of which should be corrected.</p>
<h3>Request for Tax Reduction</h3>
<p>Heavy taxation is a common sentiment among coal merchants. Specific opinions: (Lie Shan) (A) The business tax violates the order to cease re-taxing after the coal tax of 5% per hundred of value has been collected. It is proposed that it be abolished. (Two) The consolidated tax is assessed based on previous values. Now that the price of domestic coal has fallen, the tax amount remains the same. It is proposed that the tax be realistically reduced based on the current value. (Hua Feng) The coal subsidy fee is 3 jiao per ton. After four months, it is collected as before. It is proposed that the Lu Provincial Government permanently abolish it. (Liuhegou) (1) Although the consolidated tax has been reduced to 2 jiao and 5 fen per ton, it is still considered too heavy and should be further reduced. (2) It is proposed that a higher rate of anti-dumping tax be levied on foreign coal.</p>
<h3>Reducing Costs</h3>
<p>The excessive cost of coal mining is a major cause of the decline of domestic coal. The opinion of the mining merchants: (Hua Dong) Consideration should be given to both production itself and management. Regarding production itself, those in charge should be held accountable and avoid favoritism. (Liuhegou) (1) Adopt a tight-fisted policy for operating expenses. (2) Mining costs have gradually increased in recent years due to the impact of the current situation. The main reasons are increased wages and expensive materials. Efforts should be made to improve work efficiency and avoid waste of materials. Other requests include subsidies for purchasing machinery and unity among businesses to avoid unnecessary competition.</p>
<h3>Impact of Japanese Silk Dumping: The Demise of China's Silk Industry: Factory Closures Exhausted, Labor Disputes Arise</h3>
<p>Wu Zhu Resolves and Mediates the Recovery. China's silk industry has been affected by the dumping of Japanese silk and European and American influence. Silk prices have plummeted, leading to the exhaustion of silk factory closures. The case of Wu Zhu's factory demolishing factory buildings and dismissing workers was resolved through mediation by the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday. The case of the absconding manager of the Fuxing Factory is currently being mediated. Details are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Wu Zhu Silk Factory</h3>
<p>The owner of the Wu Zhu Silk Factory on Hengfeng Road, Zhabei, recognizing the decline of the silk industry and the inability to rent out the factory site, decided to completely demolish all four workshops and rebuild them into residences. All workers in the machine room were dismissed. The Social Affairs Bureau again convened mediation yesterday. Yuan Yunlong, director of the Sixth District Silk Industry Union, and all the workers, and Lin Yu, the factory representative, attended. The mediation was presided over by Zhu Guilin, chairman of the bureau, and Wang Zhichin recorded. After a long period of persuasion, a settlement was signed. The factory paid severance pay of 600 yuan, which was distributed in proportion to the workers' wages.</p>
<h3>Fuxing Silk Factory</h3>
<p>The manager of the Fuxing Silk Factory on Changan Road, Zhabei, fled after being unable to maintain the business due to the slump in the silk industry and heavy losses. All the male and female workers, owing more than 3,000 yuan in wages, were panicked and caused disputes. Yesterday, the workers went to the Sixth District Silk Industry Union to request negotiations. After persuasion, they dispersed. The Municipal Party Department and the Social Affairs Bureau, in addition to persuading the workers, have negotiated with the factory owner and others to find ways to pay the workers' wages first.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Seamen's Union, assisting in blockading the Min Sea mouth of the National Seamen's Association, held a meeting yesterday to condemn the rebels and suppress the bandits because Li Jishen, Chen Mingshu, and others took advantage of the internal and external troubles of the country to rebel in Fujian. The entire nation was deeply indignant. Details are recorded separately as follows:</p>
<h3>Representatives Attending</h3>
<p>The Seamen's Conference for Punishing the Rebels and Suppressing the Bandits was held at the Seamen's Union Hall on Wengjia Branch Road at 10:00 AM yesterday. There were 350 representatives of seamen from the Middle Cabin Public Office, the China Merchants Cargo Handling Department, the Jardine Cargo Handling Club, the Junan Association, the Navigation Friendship Association, the Wheel Mechanics Association, the Drivers Association, and various wheel companies, including Wei Xie Sheng and Wu Qing, Ma Shenyan, etc. The Seamen's General Association specially sent Gao Shuren and Xie Taiqing to attend and provide guidance. Gao Yimou, Lu Rongzhi, and Si Shijian served as the presidium, Tao Jingkui recorded, and Chu Jingwu was the master of ceremonies, and Lü Shuangxi was in charge of discipline.</p>
<h3>Chairman's Report</h3>
<p>After the opening ceremony and formalities, Chairman Si Shijian first reported, saying: Since the loss of the four northeastern provinces, unexpectedly Chen Mingshu, Li Jishen, and others, taking advantage of the nation's internal and external troubles, gathered the so-called Nineteenth Route Army, hailed as national heroes, and the Communist Party's nationalistic factions, a motley crew, and rebelled in Fujian, arbitrarily changing the reign title. The entire nation was indignant. We seamen are also part of the nation. We should stand on the national standpoint and eliminate these rebellious traitors who harm the country and the people. Next, General Association Instructor Gao Shuren gave a speech, saying that he was very pleased to see everyone's emotions at the meeting, sad, solemn and enthusiastic. The traitors Chen and Li, as members of the Central Committee, took advantage of the serious national crisis, disregarding everything, and arbitrarily formed a People's Government. He hoped that the seamen would unite and assist the government to fully suppress the Fujian rebellion and the communist bandits, so as not to lose the original intention of today's meeting and preserve the past glory of the seamen.</p>

The lost territories in the Northeast have not been recovered, and the rebellion in Fujian has risen again. The flames are rampant, and the territory is shrinking day by day. At this critical moment of survival, it is time to unite and seek salvation. All of you are pillars of the party and the country, and the people rely on you very much. This Fourth Plenary Session of the Central Committee is the key to saving the crisis and rescuing the nation. Please abandon your prejudices and attend on time, unite sincerely, and jointly formulate great plans. The party and the country will be fortunate, and the nation will be fortunate. The Seamen's Conference to Punish the Rebels and Suppress the Bandits bows, salt seal.</p>
<h3>Telegram Requesting Suppression of Rebels</h3>
<p>The conference also telegraphed all sectors and the Central Government to unanimously condemn the rebellious text, saying: (Omitted above) (Over the years, the Central Committee has paid attention to the difficulties of the times and carefully planned domestic peace and foreign resistance, striving to rescue the country from danger in this precarious situation. Unexpectedly, Chen Mingshu, Li Jishen, and others rebelled in Fujian, presumptuously establishing a false regime, colluding with the Communists and attaching themselves to enemies, betraying the party and harming the country, undermining the fourth encirclement and suppression of the Red bandits and the great plan of resisting Japan and defending the country, endangering the survival of the country and the nation. When the news of the rebellion came, the entire country was shocked. Therefore, the Shanghai Seamen's Conference to Punish the Rebels and Suppress the Bandits was immediately held. Firstly, a request was made to the Central Government to issue a clear order to suppress the rebellion and send troops to pacify it, to uphold the party, lead the revolution, follow the construction program, strive to implement the Three Principles of the People, and thoroughly suppress the Red bandits to bring peace to the people. I hope that we will all rise up together, unite our efforts to eliminate this Qing Father (a metaphor for a villain), so as to clear the difficulties in Lu (a state in ancient China) and maintain the foundation of the country. (Omitted below) The association also requested the Seamen's General Association to block the Min Sea mouth from now on. The original text is omitted.)</p>
<h3>Zhu Fohai's Department Telegraphed War Situation</h3>
<p>Dong Guojie, director of the Shanghai liaison office of Zhu Fohai, commander-in-chief of the Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army in Rehe, received a telegram from Fan Cheng, chief of staff, from Ping: (Omitted above) According to a report from liaison officer Jin Guoliang, the first and second columns of the fourth route under the command of Wang Guoqing, stationed in Rehe West, fought fiercely with a combined force of about 2,000 Japanese enemy troops and artillery in the area of Mojiazi. They fought hand-to-hand several times in two days and nights. The enemy forces were unable to resist and were retreating. The fifth route under the command of Tong Shujin and Yang Chunshan and others simultaneously surrounded the enemy, killing more than 100 people, seizing more than 100 rifles, one mountain gun, and three machine guns, as well as countless military supplies.</p>
<h3>Municipal Chamber of Commerce Recommended Arbitration Committee for Labor and Management Disputes</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce replied to the Municipal Government yesterday, saying: Report on reporting matters. On November 3, the Municipal Government's Order No. 7 was received, approving the ministry's consultation and ordering compliance and reporting regarding the formulation of interim measures for the Arbitration Committee, etc. A copy of the measures was attached and sent to the association. Subsequently, on November 5, the Municipal Government's Order No. 9 was received, approving the ministry's consultation and requesting the association to order the recommendation of the Arbitration Committee members for the 23rd and 24th years in accordance with the law, and to submit the list for approval and filing with the ministry, etc. In compliance, it immediately followed the provisions of Article 5 of the Interim Measures for the Appointment of Arbitrators. At the 54th Standing Committee meeting, Wang Xiaolai, Wang Yansong, and Luo Qinghua were appointed as representatives, and a report was submitted to the Municipal Government for preliminary review. Subsequently, after receiving approval, the representatives were convened again, and in accordance with the provisions of Article 16 of the amended Law on the Handling of Labor and Management Disputes, 32 arbitrators were appointed separately. The list has been prepared and submitted with documents, requesting the Municipal Government to review and approve it, and forward it for filing, which would be convenient for the public. The Shanghai Municipal Government is respectfully submitted, with the list attached as follows: Hu Juewen, metal machinery industry; Zhang Peiqin, paper industry; Ma Shaoquan, mineral ash industry; Yu Zuoting, money industry; Kui Yanfang, transportation industry; Zhu Wenqi, dyeing and weaving industry; Lufei Boming, book industry; Ma Jiliang, rice industry; Wang Zhixin, banking industry; Yuan Ludeng, shipping industry; Lu Wenshao, rice industry; Xu Guanqun, cosmetics industry; Tu Kaizheng, new medicine industry; Ye Jiaxing, sausage industry; Lao Jingxiu, cigarette factory industry; Zheng Hairuo, department store industry; Wang Shiqiang, electrical silk factory industry; Shen Huachen, silk factory industry; Li Shuxiong, insurance industry; Fu Zuoheng, pawnshop industry; Ke Ganchen, cotton fabric industry; Ye Yinshan, Shanghai Paper Mill; Wan Chen, woolen industry; Chen Ziyi, miscellaneous grain and oil cake industry; Wen Lanting, yarn industry; Luo Qinghua, silk fabric industry; Zheng Chengqing, north-south goods exchange industry; Chen Liangyu, tobacco exchange industry; Du Yuesheng, Fang Jiaobo, fresh fish industry; Xu Jiqing, banking industry; Pei Yunqing, money industry.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Industry and Commerce Approved the Joint Association of Mechanical Factories; Anti-Dumping Tax Has Been Consulted with the Ministry of Finance</h3>
<p>The Joint Association of National Mechanical Product Factories in this city has submitted a request to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, requesting the imposition of anti-dumping duties due to the devaluation and dumping of Japanese goods, which has put domestic manufacturers in a dangerous situation. The original report stated that the Japanese are cunning and dump goods with tax evasion and under-reporting, intentionally harming China's industry. For example, for camphor and borneol (i.e., borneol), China's total annual tax sales are about 60,000 pounds. The Mei Long Perfumery Factory's annual production is sufficient to meet national demand, but the Japanese intend to evade taxes in Shanghai by various methods. For example, the selling price of camphor in its own country is 1.6 Japanese yen, but it is sold in China for only 1.3 Shanghai silver dollars. The selling price of borneol in its own country is 5 Japanese yen, but after arriving in Shanghai, it is only sold for 3.8 silver dollars. The difference in raw material costs is very large. It is requested that anti-dumping duties be levied as soon as possible in accordance with items 1325 and Article 6 of the Provisional Regulations on the Levy of Anti-Dumping Duties. Furthermore, the Japanese have changed the brand names and sell them mixed in the country. Please implement the regulations on the origin label as soon as possible. For example, for the above-mentioned goods that China lacks, the consent of the Japanese customs must be obtained before they can be brought ashore, and a tax rate of 100% of the value must be levied. However, for Japanese goods, only a tax rate of 20% of the value is levied, and there are no restrictions. It is requested that it be implemented as soon as possible and the tax rate be increased to maintain the industry (omitted below). After receiving the report, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce issued an order to the association yesterday, saying: Received the report. The request to protect domestic borneol and camphor has been forwarded to the Ministry of Finance for review and handling. Please be informed of the approval. This approval, Chen Gongbo, Minister, December 12, 22nd year of the Republic of China.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Finance Stipulated Four Measures to Strictly Investigate and Suppress Smuggled Cigarettes; Cigarette Factories Are Limited to Being Established in Shanghai, Tianjin, Qingdao, and Hankou</h3>
<p>For new factories, the capital must be more than 500,000. The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce increased the cigarette tax, and cigarette merchants could not bear the burden. They telegraphed the Ministry of Finance to postpone the increase and quickly set up an investigation of smuggled cigarettes to maintain the business of cigarette merchants. Yesterday, a telegram was received from the Ministry of Finance in reply, saying: The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce has read the telegram. Cigarettes are luxury consumer goods, and all countries levy heavy taxes. The cigarette tax rate levied in our country is still light. This time, the ministry increased the tax on the first class to 160 yuan and the second class to 80 yuan due to the exhaustion of the national treasury and the urgent need for funds for bandit suppression and construction. The ministry has submitted it to the Executive Yuan for deliberation and resolution, and the Executive Yuan has submitted it to the Central Political Conference for resolution and implementation, and has sent a letter to the National Government instructing the Executive Yuan to forward it to the ministry for the ministry to instruct its subordinates to comply with it uniformly. The request to postpone implementation or reduce the new tax rate cannot be approved. Regarding the investigation and suppression of tax-evading smuggled cigarettes in this tax increase plan, four measures have been stipulated: (1) The establishment of cigarette factories is limited to four places: Shanghai, Tianjin, Qingdao, and Hankou. Other places are not allowed to establish them. Existing ones should be ordered to move within a time limit. After the deadline, the government will take them back at an estimated price. (2) The capital of newly established cigarette factories must be more than 500,000 yuan. (3) Hand-rolled cigarettes should be strictly restricted and no further registrations should be processed, or they should be banned immediately. (4) Tax police are responsible for strictly investigating and prohibiting tax evasion and counterfeiting of hand-rolled cigarettes. In places where there are no tax police stationed, investigation teams should be formed separately to conduct serious investigations. The above items have also been ordered by the ministry to be carried out in sequence to maintain the legitimate business of cigarette merchants. According to a report from Wu Tingsheng, chairman of the Cigarette Industry Association, the meeting resolved to comply with the new tax rate. Special reply to inform, Ministry of Finance, Zhen, Seal.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Telegraphs the Executive Yuan to Abolish the Investigation and Suppression Office and Concurrently Investigate Stamps. It Should Order Chinese and Foreign Merchants to Use Stamps Equally.</h3>
<p>The inspection method is still handled by the Provincial Bureau. The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Finance yesterday, saying: (Omitted title) Merchants in the concessions have repeatedly stated to the association that since the Cigarette Investigation and Suppression Office has also been in charge of investigating and suppressing stamps, when performing their duties, police officers are usually accompanied by the police force to search. They often intentionally seek to punish Chinese merchants and distort the French text, causing peaceful merchants to be disturbed. Once the case is transferred to the court, the police force acts as the plaintiff and arbitrarily criticizes the shops during the trial, leaving almost no opportunity for redress. After a penalty is imposed, or because the judgment is inappropriate and they want to file an appeal, the competent department cannot accept it due to court procedures. Merchants can only pay the previous amount by exhausting all their possessions. The handling of cases that violate stamp tax regulations in the Chinese area allows representatives of the Chamber of Commerce to attend and be seated, and after the penalty is imposed, reasons can be stated to request a retrial. The methods are completely different. This kind of distorted treatment causes merchants in the concessions to suffer greatly. In addition, foreign merchants in the concessions can stand aside from the documents that should be stamped, so the cases investigated jointly with the police force can be carried out in a willful manner. In one case, a penalty of several thousand was imposed, almost causing the store to be unable to survive. The only way to remedy it is to order Chinese and foreign merchants to use stamps equally in accordance with the law. The method of inspecting stamps in the concessions should still be handled by the Provincial Bureau's office in Shanghai, as in the initial case on November 1, 18th year of the Republic of China, to avoid harassment. Please forward the report to the Yuan Ministry for relief. The association has investigated and found that the situation they described is true. The association reported the situation and respectfully requested the Yuan Ministry to review and approve the request, which would be convenient for the public. The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce bows, Yuan.</p>
<h3>Postal Affairs Associations' Expression Regarding the Huang Case</h3>
<p>It was reported in the newspaper the other day that Huang Naishu, Director General of Posts, issued a statement regarding the allegations by the two Postal Affairs Associations, stating that he intends to proceed with legal procedures. It was also reported yesterday that the Ministry of Communications also intends to temporarily ignore the case. Therefore, people generally want to know how the case will turn out. According to the Standing Committee members of the two associations, the allegations are based on solid evidence and stem from the long-standing motive of protecting the postal service. Since Huang took office as Director General, various measures have been detrimental to the postal service. Postal workers across the country have been witnessing and deeply saddened for a long time. Unexpectedly, this time, he came up with a strange idea and suggested to the Ministry of Communications to seize huge sums of money to go abroad, supposedly to inspect the postal service. This is just another trick of Liu Shufan, using the excuse of inspection to fill his own pockets. Moreover, the cost is nearly 200,000, which cannot be said to be insignificant. At a time when the postal service's economy is exhausted and the national government is implementing a tight policy, the inspection not only harms public funds but also does nothing to help the postal service. Therefore, the two associations were compelled by righteousness to file a complaint with the Central Party Headquarters and the Administrative Supervisory Yuan, hoping that Huang, who is guilty of corruption and dereliction of duty, would be thoroughly investigated. The allegations have been detailed in the two associations' reports, so they will not be repeated here. However, the spokesman of the Ministry of Communications said that they intend to temporarily ignore the case. Regardless of whether there is bias, the association did not originally file a complaint with the Ministry of Communications. Whether it is ignored or not is not a problem. I believe that the Central Government, in order to clean up corruption and rectify officialdom, will definitely conduct a thorough investigation impartially. As for Huang's statement that he intends to proceed with legal procedures, according to the Postal Service Outline, Huang should first apply for suspension of duties before he can proceed with litigation procedures. The two associations, upholding the spirit of impartiality, will certainly deal with him in accordance with the law.</p>

<h3>Municipal Public Security Bureau, Police Training Institute Scheduled to Open</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau previously had a police training institute in Zhabei. There have been 15 graduating classes of police cadets. Unfortunately, it was destroyed in the January 28th Incident last year, resulting in its suspension. This autumn, Director Wen, in view of the fact that the quality of police knowledge is deeply and greatly related to social stability, resolutely requested Mayor Wu to approve its restoration. Furthermore, in the past, police cadets had to graduate in three months, which he deeply considered insufficient. Therefore, this time, after the decision of the preparatory committee, the graduation was extended to six months, so that the cadets can have good knowledge. Since the preparation, it has been difficult to establish. It is assumed that Quanzhang Villa on Longhua Road is the location of the institute. The position of director of the institute is concurrently held by Director Wen. He also requested the mayor to appoint Luo Lianfeng as the director of education, to be responsible for all matters of the general affairs, academic affairs, and training departments. All the directors and instructors of the departments are well-known figures of the time. The academic program is also more complete than before (including English conversation and other courses). To commemorate the restoration, the official opening ceremony is scheduled to be held at 10:00 AM on the 17th of this month (Sunday). It is heard that hundreds of invitations have been issued, respectfully inviting the heads of various agencies in the city, as well as prominent gentry merchants and newspaper reporters, to attend and witness the ceremony, and urging the mayor to come to the institute to give a speech. At that time, there will be a grand occasion on Longhua Road.</p>

<p>Mr. Yang Mingding, a native of Shangyu County, Zhejiang Province, graduated from the Engineering Department of National Central University and worked for the Department of Health, where he was quite effective. Later, in view of the shortage of sanitary engineering talents, in the autumn of the 20th year of the Republic of China, he was ordered to go to the United States to study at Harvard University, majoring in sanitary engineering, to seek further education. He graduated in the summer of this year and obtained a master's degree. He then went to Europe to examine the sanitary construction of various countries. It has now been completed. It is heard that he will arrive in Shanghai on the American Meisai Shi's Kaobilun on the 20th of this month. Mr. Yang is knowledgeable and experienced, and is a rare talent in our country. He will make a contribution to the sanitary cause of our country in the future. Friends and relatives in Shanghai have prepared to go to welcome him when the ship arrives.</p>

<h3>Jiaxing Female School Principal Deceived to Shanghai and Severely Tormented; All Kinds of Evils in the Prosperous City</h3>
<p>Innocent Female Teacher Suffered Unfortune. Zhang Yuzhen, also known as Zhang Xinbao, a woman from Tongxiang, Jiaxing, is 17 years old, beautiful in appearance and dignified in attitude. She graduated from Jiaxing Normal School and has a good education and beautiful handwriting. After graduation, she served as the acting principal of Qinglu District Elementary School. However, the rural education cause,</p>
<h3>Commonly Known as Impoverished</h3>
<p>His monthly salary was meager, barely enough to make ends meet. There was a woman named Zhuang Suzhen (also known as A'er), about twenty years old, from the same hometown as Zhang. They had known each other since childhood and were exceptionally close. Two years ago, Zhuang came to Shanghai and worked as a waitress at the Tianyunlou Amusement Park in the Wing On Company, while also engaging in prostitution. Her life was considered quite good, so her clothes and accessories followed modern fashion trends. Every time she returned to her hometown, the villagers envied her. On August 12th of this year, Zhuang returned to her hometown again and met Zhang. Zhuang then had a</p>
<h3>Malicious Idea</h3>
<p>She told Zhang that the occupation in Shanghai had a high monthly salary and was easy to do, far better than a "bench life" (meaning a poor and unstable existence). Zhang was misled by her words and informed her father, Zhang Baonan. After obtaining his consent, she resigned from her teaching position and, on the 14th, came to Shanghai with Zhuang. They stayed at Zhuang's house at No. 13 Yude Lane, Yunnan Road. On the evening of the 18th, Zhuang falsely told Zhang that she would take her out for fun. Zhang, unaware of the scheme, gladly followed her. Unexpectedly, Zhuang took Zhang to Fuzhou Road, at the</p>
<h3>Wu Gong Inn</h3>
<p>Room 409. At that time, a man named Li Yinxian was already in the room. Zhuang immediately changed her attitude, speaking harshly and forcefully, compelling Zhang to engage in sexual relations with Li. Zhang firmly refused and wept bitterly. After Zhuang and Li's violence, Zhang's virginity was declared broken, and her reputation was tarnished. Although Zhang suffered greatly, she dared</p>
<h3>Not To Publicize</h3>
<p>Because of the surrounding evil forces and the need to protect her reputation. Afterwards, Li gave Zhuang a large sum of money. The next day, they continued to engage in sexual acts once at the Great Shanghai Hotel. Zhang wrote several letters to her father, asking him to come to Shanghai and take her back, but Zhuang hid them all without sending them. As a result, Zhang Baonan never knew the slightest bit about his daughter's humiliation. Zhang Yuzhen was ravaged more than a dozen times and always thought of ways to escape this fiery pit, but she was never able to fulfill her wish. Recently, Zhang Baonan noticed that his daughter had been away for several months, and</p>
<h3>All Communication Ceased</h3>
<p>Letters to Zhuang also received no reply. Therefore, he entrusted his daughter's cousin, Liang Shouqi, to inquire at Zhuang's place. After receiving the entrustment, Liang went to Zhuang's house the day before yesterday and met Zhang. Zhang then told him the whole story. Liang believed that family scandals should not be publicized, so he did not argue with Zhuang. He ordered Zhang to pack her luggage and return to her hometown with him. Unexpectedly, while Zhang was packing her luggage, Zhuang suddenly came forward and detained the boxes and other items, not allowing her to leave. Liang and Zhang had no choice but to leave alone. While walking along Shandong Road, Zhuang suddenly</p>
<h3>Gave Chase From Behind</h3>
<p>Twisted Zhang Yuzhen and forced her to go home, leading to a dispute. The incident was heard by Hua constable No. 182 and detective Pang Yutang of the Old Zha police station, who came forward, arrested Zhuang, and took her back to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, she was sent to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. The police lawyer, Qian Xunjiu, explained the case, saying that the plaintiff in this case belonged to the education field, had excellent literary skills, and was a virgin. Now, due to the defendant's coercion, her</p>
<h3>Chastity Broken</h3>
<p>Her reputation has been ruined. This kind of behavior is no different from that of beasts. He requested the court to impose the highest penalty according to Article 246 of the Criminal Law. Zhang was taken back by her cousin, and so on. Subsequently, Zhang recounted her experience of being deceived. Everyone who heard it felt sorry for her, and they hired lawyer Yang Zhenxiong to represent her. Lawyer Yang immediately submitted</p>
<h3>Written In Her Own Hand</h3>
<p>The story of her plight was presented to prove that Zhang Yuzhen was indeed a person in the education field and her literary foundation. When questioned, Zhuang Suzhen's confession was cunning, blaming it all on her aunt, but Zhang said that she had never seen her aunt. Judge Deng Baosun verified the confession and immediately announced the verdict in court. Zhuang Suzhen, intending to profit by enticing a good family woman to engage in indecent behavior, was sentenced to eight months of imprisonment as a warning. When Zhuang heard the verdict, she still sought leniency. The court told her that if she did not agree, she could appeal. Finally, she expressed her willingness to accept the sentence and was sent to prison.</p>
<h3>Zhu Baoyuan's Estate Court Orders Submission of Inventory – Baoyuan's Widow Sues Two Sons – Repeated Reconciliation Ultimately Unsuccessful – Case Rescheduled for Continued Hearing on the 21st</h3>
<p>Zhenhe Tea House owner Zhu Baoyuan of Hai'ning started from humble beginnings. After his death, his estate of over 2.7 million was entirely in the hands of his two sons, Zhu Shunqing and Zhu Yanqing. Unexpectedly, the Shunqing brothers were greedy and showed little familial affection. They did not support their stepmother, Zhu Xinxinbao, nor did they share even a small portion with their sisters, leading to accusations from his sister Zhu Jun and others in the past, and now a lawsuit from his mother. The purpose of the lawsuits is the same: to divide the estate. The Zhu Jun case was resolved through mediation by the Shunqing brothers, each paying 80,000 yuan. However, Zhu Xinxinbao requested a division of over 600,000 yuan. Although the defendants were eager to reconcile, they were unwilling to sacrifice a large sum of money, so a peaceful resolution has not yet been reached. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Qiao Wanxuan of the First Special District Court continued the hearing. The defendants Zhu Shunqing and Zhu Yanqing still did not appear in court, but their lawyer requested a further extension, saying that reconciliation was still possible. However, the plaintiff's lawyer firmly opposed, claiming that the court had granted a ten-day extension in the previous hearing because the defendants had expressed hope for reconciliation. Afterwards, although Fang Jiaobo came to mediate, nothing came of it because the defendants refused to hand over the complete estate records. Now, the defendants' lawyer is again requesting an extension, claiming that the defendants have gone to Hangzhou and that reconciliation is still possible. This is merely empty talk, intended to delay the proceedings so that they can forge or destroy records during this period. He asked that the court investigate immediately and summon the Zhenhe Tea House accountant to investigate everything, as the case had been delayed for eight months and it seemed difficult to postpone it any further. Judge Qiao immediately ruled verbally, ordering the defendants to submit the complete property records within three days. The defendants' lawyer expressed disagreement, saying that the defendants did not have property records in their possession and that the plaintiff should prove this claim. Judge Qiao then instructed that if there were indeed no property records, they should provide a list of all property items for review. The defendants' lawyer then replied that if a list had to be provided, they would first have to investigate, which would take a considerable amount of time, and that three days was too short. The plaintiff's lawyer refuted this, saying that the case had been delayed for eight months and that records had been forged for three or four months, so why would further investigation be needed? This was clearly an intentional delay to engage in forgery. After both sides debated, the court announced that the hearing would be rescheduled for the afternoon of the 21st of this month.</p>
<h3>Pudong Ronglin Warehouse Labor Dispute Resolved Peacefully Yesterday Abolition of Contract Labor System Implementation of Labor-Management Cooperation</h3>
<p>The dispute over unloading at the Pudong Ronglin Warehouse, due to a dispute between foremen, has been going on for more than two months. On Tuesday, when the Chunhe ship arrived at the warehouse to start work, another major conflict almost occurred due to the former foreman Li Hongji vying for the job. After mediation by the Social Bureau and various party and government agencies, it was peacefully resolved yesterday. A major labor dispute has finally come to an end. The situation is recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Mediation Process</h3>
<p>The Social Bureau, considering that the dispute between labor and management at the warehouse was unresolved, greatly affecting the lives of all workers and hindering the unloading of cargo from merchant ships, was inappropriate. Therefore, it invited Ronglin Warehouse representative Mr. Lin, former foreman Li Hongji, and worker representative Qiu Anqin to the Pudong Warehouse for negotiations. After eight hours, a solution was agreed upon. Li Hongji was previously hired by the pier authorities, so he could not be effective. The contract signed by Qiu Antai and the Ronglin Warehouse representative workers was also invalid. The contract labor system was abolished, and labor-management cooperation was realized. The dockworkers directly negotiated with Ronglin Warehouse to determine the unloading work methods.</p>
<h3>Tasking Workers</h3>
<p>From all the workers, Xue Zikuan, Wang Dengxiang, and other twelve people were selected to be responsible for contacting Ronglin Warehouse regarding work and wages. The title of foreman was abolished. The management of loading and unloading cargo and the workers' handling on the pier was to be handled by an official separately dispatched by the company. In this way, the interests of the workers and the company's business can both be taken into consideration. All parties agreed to this solution, so representatives from various party and government agencies, together with representatives from labor and management at Ronglin Warehouse, negotiated a resolution and set the date for unloading cargo to begin on the 14th.</p>
<h3>Work Began Yesterday</h3>
<p>After the worker's unloading dispute was resolved, Ronglin Warehouse started work yesterday. The Chunhe ship, which arrived at the pier on the 12th, opened its holds and unloaded coal yesterday morning. Yesterday, a reporter went to the company, and its person in charge said that this time, the party and government agencies took the initiative to mediate, achieving labor-management cooperation and abolishing the long-standing evil system of contract labor. Work has now started from today, and there are no problems in the future. However, the warehouse suffered various losses, such as land rent and business losses, amounting to tens of thousands of yuan during the two months of disputes. The business has now been entrusted to the Walen Foreign Firm as an agent.</p>
<h3>City Government Disposes of Xianmian Temple Property Property Rights Transferred to Shanghai High School for Management</h3>
<p>Construction of Xianmian Hall to Preserve Historical Sites The Shanghai High School of Jiangsu Province's bidding for Xianmian Temple property has been opposed by the Shanghai Municipal Agricultural Association, as the temple is the historical site of the agricultural ancestor Huang Daopo and belongs to local public property. A special request was submitted to the Municipal Party Headquarters to consult the Municipal Government to stop it and request that it be allocated as an agricultural exhibition hall for commemoration. The Municipal Government then ordered the Land Bureau to investigate the property rights and then formulated three measures to preserve the historical site of the temple and sent them to the Municipal Party Headquarters for transfer. The instructions are recorded below for your information. The municipal government's official letter No. 2695 stated, "The council's letter was approved, based on the municipal agricultural association's request to stop the Shanghai High School's sale of Xianmian Temple property. It should be approved to be allocated to the association to hold agricultural exhibitions, etc. Please investigate, verify, and reply." Upon investigation, the case was previously requested by the Zhabei Agricultural Association of the city to prohibit the school from selling Xianmian Temple, etc., to the government. It was found that this case had been investigated by the competent authority. Although the ancestral property was publicly owned locally, it was recorded in the local records, but the Shanghai County Office issued a management certificate in the third year of the Republic of China (1914). Therefore, the property belonged to Shanghai High School and had already been ordered by the competent authorities to jointly formulate three articles to preserve the ancient buildings of the temple: (1) Build Xianmian Hall in the new school building as a formal memorial, and open up agricultural land as a spiritual memorial. (2) Xianmian Hall will be open every year during the Chongnong Festival (Agriculture Festival). Agricultural organizations in the city may hold meetings in the hall on that day. (3) All stone tablets and other items of historical value in the current Xianmian Temple will be moved to Xianmian Hall. The reply from the Jiangsu Provincial Government was also deeply supported, and Shanghai High School was ordered to comply with the above handling of the case. The corresponding letter replies to the above-mentioned matter. It is hereby ordered that the council be notified. This order.</p>
<h3>French Concession Detains Two Chinese and Russian Thieves</h3>
<p>Lujiawan French Police Station Seeks Lost Stolen Goods According to the North-China Daily News, the French Concession arrested two criminals yesterday. One was Chinese, who had repeatedly committed theft since the beginning of last year. He pretended to rent a house and entered the residences of Chinese and foreigners. Taking advantage of people's lack of preparation, he stole items and left. He used this technique carefully, and the case had not been solved. He was arrested yesterday and confessed to having committed fourteen thefts. Based on his confession, the police retrieved many stolen items, such as jewelry, from various pawnshops. These items belonged to five people who had not reported the theft to the police when they were stolen, and their current addresses are unknown, so they are all stored in the police station awaiting the original owners to claim them. They include a watch stolen from No. 9 Fulili Road in February, several pieces of clothing stolen from No. 1296 Lafayette Road in February, a pocket watch stolen from Shuncheng Lane in May, and another pocket watch stolen from No. 14 Raoul Road in September. The other criminal was Russian, who had committed six robberies. The police found many items on his person and in various pawnshops, which he claimed were all his personal belongings. However, the police believe they were stolen between January and March of this year. They include two pocket watches, each worth 150 to 200 yuan, a men's wristwatch, and a women's diamond-studded wristwatch. Anyone who has lost items of this kind can go to the Lujiawan French Police Station to claim them.</p>

<p>Attached to the Japanese Consulate Police Department After the January 28th Incident, Japan established additional police agencies in Shanghai, attached to the Consulate General, and specially appointed Kakikatsu Misaburo as the police chief. The police force under his command totals more than 200 people. All Japanese consulates in the Yangtze River basin have had police reinforcements, all under the direct jurisdiction of Kakikatsu.

Now, foreign affairs police have been added, and they arrived from Japan yesterday. The general situation is described below:</p>
<p>Expanding Organization Shanghai is an international commercial port with significant international relations. Various countries have different positions and their own interests, so they attach great importance to the Far East. The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs has specially added a foreign affairs police team to the Japanese Consulate General in Shanghai, also under the direct jurisdiction of Kakikatsu Misaburo, the chief of the Consulate Police Department. The expenses are allocated by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and its mission is different from that of ordinary police, focusing on all international situations.</p>
<p>Japanese Police Arrive in Shanghai After the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs decided to add a foreign affairs police team in Shanghai, it selected 40 police officers and officers from Japan with knowledge of international negotiations. They arrived in Shanghai yesterday by ship from Kobe. They include Honmura Yoshinori, Ohwa Katsumi, Kyohomoto Iwao, Hirai Izumio, Wada Takeshi, Matsukawa Reizo, Tanimoto Hachiro, Naito Shinji, Kiyoshima Kazuyo, Akioka Motomichi, Uchida Masayuki, Koshisu Sanshiro, Machida Kenji, Hosokawa, Imaizumi, Sakaguchi, Tsukano Shoichi, Miyagi, Kamimura, Yoshioka Teiji, Akaba, Kasuga, Tomiyama Masaichi, Tsuda Susumu, Kato Jitsuo, Hosokawa Isao, Saruya Kikuji, Kai, etc. They all arrived in Shanghai on the Nagasaki Maru and landed at the Wayside Wharf.</p>
<p>Reporting to the Consulate When the foreign affairs police officers arrived in Shanghai, the Japanese Consulate General had already received a telegram from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Therefore, when the officers arrived, the Consulate General sent personnel to welcome them at the wharf and sent cars to pick up all the officers and take them to the Consulate General to report. When Chief Kakikatsu returns to Shanghai from his inspection of various places, they will be organized into teams and assigned tasks to perform their duties.</p>
<p>Kakikatsu's Inspection Along the Yangtze River From Zhenjiang, Nanjing, Wuhu, Jiujiang, Hankou, Yichang, Chongqing, to Changsha, each Japanese consulate has a police team, with varying numbers depending on the complexity of the affairs. These Japanese police officers were newly added after the January 28th Incident to assist consuls in various places in handling criminal cases. Kakikatsu Misaburo, the police chief stationed in Shanghai, is personally taking the Nisshin Company's Fengyang Maru yesterday to inspect the diligence of the Japanese police in various places along the Yangtze River. It is expected to be completed on the 15th.</p>
<h3>Grand Opening of the Minfu Bank</h3>
<p>Since the concentration of cash in Shanghai, the banking industry has risen sharply. This year, more than a dozen new banks have opened. Yesterday (14th), the Minfu Bank, founded by Shanghai celebrities Min Ruizhi and Du Yuesheng, also announced its opening. The bank is located at Tianjin Road and Henan Road. In front of the bank, the traffic was heavy in the morning, and traffic was almost cut off. Sending off and welcoming guests continued until noon before it thinned out slightly. Many political, gentry, business, and other celebrities attended, such as Qu Yingguang, Huang Qinglan, Tang Shoumin, Bei Songsun, Wang Boyuan, Wu Yunzhai, Wu Zhihao, Yang Meinan, Ye Fuxiao, Zhou Wenrui, Pei Yunqing, Wang Yansong, Fan Jietang, Yang Yusheng, and from other places, Jin Guanxian and Sun Yuelou, etc., numbering no less than a thousand people.

<h3>New Building of the Zhonghui Bank to Be Completed Soon</h3>
<p>The Zhonghui Bank on Rue Edward VII in this city is one of the member banks of the Shanghai Banking Association. Since its establishment five years ago, it has been committed to management and spared no effort. The capital has been fully paid up to 2 million national currency, with notable credit and developed business. Because the original site was narrow and insufficient for expansion, a nine-story building is being built on the west side of the bank's original site. The building is magnificent in architecture and exquisite in equipment, with all necessary hot and cold air pipes, sanitation, and fire protection equipment. It is also heard that in addition to the first and second floors of the building being used by the bank, there are shops, offices, and apartments for rent. Transportation is convenient, and rents are low. The entire building will be completed soon, and there has been a very enthusiastic response from those who wish to rent.</p>
<h3>Taxi Stand Established on the Bund</h3>
<p>– Municipal Council Plans to Invite Bids – For the convenience of ship passengers, the Municipal Council has discussed several times whether to designate a location on the Bund to allow taxis to park for passengers to hire. How this matter will be implemented, as well as traffic aspects and fares, have all been studied. A certain car company had petitioned to have the designated location reserved for its exclusive use, but the Municipal Council decided to allocate a piece of vacant land that had been reserved for chartered cars but not utilized for common use by all car companies. Since the designation, the car companies have been observing and not moving forward, as the car companies are willing to set up exclusive stations, but consider it inconvenient for common use by all companies. Now, the board of directors is reconsidering and has decided that if no significant objections are raised, the board will invite bids from car companies to set up stations in the area, which is south of the customs inspection shed. The number of vehicles should not exceed ten.</p>

<h3>Chen Chunan's Case of Being Sued by Nephew for Occupying Property Comes to an End</h3>
<p>Chen Chunan, a Chaozhou merchant who made his fortune in the opium trade, resides in the Zhilanfang mansion at No. 16 West Baixianqiao Road, French Concession. Recently, his nephew Jiancheng (son of Chen Chunan's deceased third younger brother, Shaokai) hired lawyers Li Mian and Dong Banggan to file a private prosecution with the Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court, accusing Chen Chunan of occupying jointly owned property, and attached a civil lawsuit demanding a one-quarter share of the property, estimated at 2 million yuan. The defendant, Chen Chunan, also hired lawyer Lu Dingkui to defend him. The case has been heard several times. Yesterday was another continued hearing. Both sides brought their lawyers to court to wait for the hearing. At 2 p.m., Judge Sun Penghan presided over the hearing in the Fourth Court. First, the lawyers for the plaintiff presented several important pieces of evidence. At the same time, the defendant also presented a family division document and invited Chen Xingwei, son of the deceased witness Chen Zhisan, and Chen Weinan, owner of the Hefeng soil firm, to be questioned. After the judge inspected the evidence from both sides, he first summoned the most important witness in the case, Chen Shuntian (the plaintiff's fourth paternal uncle, also the defendant's fourth younger brother). According to him, when his late father Chen Yunqing was dying, although the family had divided, a part of the property was not included. His eldest brother Chunan had a large number of shares in the Hefeng soil firm. Subsequently, the defendant's witnesses Chen Xingwei and Chen Weinan gave their statements. The judge, believing that the facts were already clear, ordered the start of the debate. The lawyers on both sides debated fiercely for more than an hour. The judge ordered the debate to end and scheduled a date for sentencing.</p>
<h3>Lake Society Issues Advisory Letter Careful for Women Arriving in Shanghai To Avoid Being Deceived and Fallen</h3>
<p>The Lake Society, in view of the repeated crop failures and famine in the various counties of our hometown, and the general populace viewing Shanghai as paradise, is flocking to secure provisions. Those who obtain some partial position merely escape freezing and hunger, especially vulnerable are women of meagre knowledge. Cunning individuals often use the pretext of introducing them to factories in Shanghai, taking the opportunity to seduce them, resulting in moral decline, a situation which is increasing daily. Therefore, to mitigate the situation, the society had composed an advisory and dispatched it to governments and commerce guilds so the populous may know of the matter, so as to avoid the errant path.</p>
<h3>Zhang Wanjie Case Supreme Court Remands for Retrial</h3>
<p>Zhang Wanjie, grandson of the famous Shanghai lawyer Zhang Yipeng, studied at the China Public School on Avenue Petain in the French Concession. Because of participating in reactionary work, he was discovered by Chinese and Western detectives from the French police last autumn. They rushed to search the dormitory at No. 1260 Avenue Lafayette, and Zhang and classmates Liu Lin, Luo Jixiang (also known as Luo Jinxin and Luo Quan), and Zhang Zhenfu were arrested at the same time. At that time, Zhang was copying drafts of the "French Electricity Qinggong Daily." Evidence books and documents were seized and sent to the Third Branch of the Jiangsu High Court, which filed a public prosecution for endangering the Republic of China. At the conclusion of the trial, Zhang was sentenced to one year of imprisonment, Liu was sentenced to five years of imprisonment, Luo was sentenced to one year and two months of imprisonment, and Zhang Zhenfu was found not guilty. The seized evidence, except for items No. 28 and No. 29, was confiscated, as reported in the previous newspaper. Zhang, dissatisfied with the judgment, presented reasons and filed an appeal with the Supreme Court in Nanjing. Later, he fell ill in the detention center. His family requested that he be released on bail during the appeal period. This was approved, and he was ordered to find a shop that could guarantee 1,000 yuan in cash. The manager of the Hengfu Silver Store on Nanjing Road provided the guarantee. It is now heard that the Supreme Court has reviewed the case and, believing that the original judgment was not sufficiently detailed, has remanded the case for retrial. After receiving the case file, Judge Guo Dezhang scheduled a hearing for 2 p.m. this afternoon, summoning the appellant and the detectives in charge of the case from the police station to appear in court for trial.</p>
<h3>Attempted Rape of a Female Worker: Rickshaw Puller Sentenced to Two Years</h3>
<p>Shi Xiuying, a 21-year-old woman from Changzhou, worked at the Shanghai No. 3 Cotton Mill and lived at No. 12 Yiren Lane, Yangshupu. She had previously returned to her hometown for some matters. On the 7th of this month, at around 6:00 PM, she took a train to Shanghai, carrying a large package of clothes and belongings. Finding it inconvenient to walk, she hired a rickshaw driven by Xun Wenjin, a 25-year-old man from Jiangbei with the rickshaw number 8006, to take her home. Xun, seeing the woman's beauty, was filled with lust. He deliberately took her through Fuxing Road, Lan Road, and other places, dragging her to a desolate area of Yangshupu. There were no streetlights, so he stopped the rickshaw. It was already 7:00 PM. He asked the woman to get out temporarily, using the excuse of taking matches from the rickshaw to light a lamp. He seized the opportunity to push the woman to the ground, trying to remove her trousers and rape her. Fortunately, a road worker named Zhang Agen passed by. The woman cried for help and was rescued by Zhang, who apprehended Xun and handed him over to Chinese Constable No. 2749. He was taken to the Yangshupu Police Station, where the head constable was informed and ordered his detention. The next morning, he was sent to the First Special District Court for interrogation and a final hearing. These details have already been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Liu Yugui presided over the Criminal Court No. 3 and sentenced Xun Wenjin to two years of imprisonment. The number of days he was detained before the sentence was confirmed will be deducted from his prison term at a rate of two days of detention for one day of imprisonment.</p>
<h3>The Pitiful Chen Ayong: Crushed and Killed by a Public Bus</h3>
<p>Chen Ayong, a 35-year-old man from Luodian, worked as a shop assistant at the Yixingji Rice Store at No. 361 Dalianwan Road, Yangshupu. On the 12th of this month, he went to Xinzha Road to visit a friend. Around 5:00 PM, he wanted to return to the store and planned to take the No. 10 public bus at the Xinzha Bridge pier. However, at that time, Bus No. 15023 was coming from the west. The bus was unusually crowded with passengers. Passengers getting on and off at the stop took quite a while. When Chen tried to board the bus, it was already slowly starting to move, and the door was not fully closed. As Chen grasped the steel bar and put one foot on the step, the bus door suddenly closed, causing Chen to fall to the ground instantly. His lower body was run over by the rear wheel of the bus, and he was severely injured. The driver, Song Xiaoshan, was apparently unaware and continued driving as usual. A passerby named Shen Yusheng noticed and reported it to the police station, who ordered Detective Xia Yeshan to investigate. Unexpectedly, Chen died shortly thereafter due to his severe injuries. The detective then carried the body to the Pailun Road morgue for examination. Yesterday morning, the First Special District Court dispatched Prosecutor Zhou, along with forensic doctor Wei and clerk Wang Zuyi, to the morgue. After examining the body, they took testimony from witness Shen Yusheng, who stated that he runs a cloth store. That day, he was collecting payments on Xinzha Road and witnessed the incident while walking near the China Bank branch. He saw the deceased attempting to board the bus, which was already slightly in motion. The door suddenly closed before Chen could board. It was already evening, so he could only vaguely see that the person closing the door appeared to be wearing a uniform. Chen Dayin testified that he was a ticket seller on Public Bus No. 15023. The bus was very crowded, and he was inside selling tickets, so he did not know who closed the door at that moment. There were also eight company personnel on board, but they had already left. Prosecutor Zhou took the testimony and ruled that the deceased, Chen Ayong, male, died as a result of being struck by Public Bus No. 15023. The body was released to his wife, Chen Zhangshi, who signed a document agreeing to arrange for the coffin and burial.</p>

<h3>Flag and Song</h3>
<p>— Meng Zhen</p>
<p>Everything in China is contradictory, and many things are deformed. A country founded on agriculture sees its rural areas bankrupt, and a society that is, from beginning to end, financial has no unified currency. What else? Let me give you an example: the flag and the national anthem.</p>
<p>Since the founding of the Republic of China, there has been a continuous stream of flags:</p>
<p>After the 1911 Revolution, our national flag was designated as the Five-Color Flag (red, yellow, blue, white, and black). The military flag was the Star Flag, and the Blue Sky with a White Sun was the naval flag.</p>
<p>Later, Yuan Shikai stole the country with his Hongxian monarchy and designated the (diagonal red cross) as the center, with (yellow, blue, white, and black small triangles) on all four sides of the cross as the national flag.</p>
<p>Zhang Xun's restoration used the Qing Dynasty dragon flag again.</p>
<p>Before the Northern Expedition, the warlords used ancient general flags.</p>
<p>After the Northern Expedition, the (Blue Sky with a White Sun over a Red Earth) was adopted as the national flag, and the Blue Sky with a White Sun was the party flag.</p>
<p>As for the puppet Manchukuo, it designated (short horizontal stripes of red, blue, white, and black) to replace our Blue Sky with a White Sun, and (a sky full of yellow) to replace the Red Earth of the national flag.</p>
<p>Recently, a certain province has also designated a flag (blue on top, red on the bottom, with a five-pointed yellow star in the middle).</p>
<p>This year is the twenty-second year of the Republic of China, yet there have been ten different flags. This is a shocking thing.</p>
<p>The national flag is a country's designated flag emblem and, therefore, a country's symbol. It shows how important the national flag is! A country with a five-thousand-year history has had such great changes in this extremely important national flag in just a few decades.</p>
<p>Moreover, now our great Blue Sky with a White Sun over a Red Earth flag is hung up in shops as a signboard; in workers' homes, it is nailed over window holes; and sailboats use them as sails.</p>
<p>As for the national anthem, we once had the Qing Yun Song; but in the last ten years, there has not been a single national anthem that represents the dignity of the country.</p>
<p>China is not strong now, perhaps because the national flag and national anthem are to blame. When the day comes when the national flag is respected by the entire nation and is no longer easily changed, and when a formal national anthem is also created, then China may also be able to become strong. If not stronger than the great powers, it could at least keep pace with them.</p>
<h3>Character Comes From Food</h3>
<p>— Pei Yu</p>
<p>Some say that people in Suzhou are known for their exceptionally soft and fluent speech because they have drunk the filthy water from the city river since childhood. The soft speech of Wu natives is cultivated by drinking filthy water. Whether this statement is accurate is unknown, but based on the latest principles, it is easy to explain that a person's character comes from what they eat. Therefore, the statement "character comes from food" is more reliable than the statement "dialects differ due to water," because someone has conducted in-depth research on the relationship between character and food. The main interpreter of this new science, named An Sijin, provides us with many different examples in his booklet, Borology.</p>
<p>For example, people with a strong physique and quiet temperament invariably choose to eat large pieces of meat and indigestible foods. Those who like a lot of seasonings (such as salt, vinegar, spices, etc.) are easily stimulated and prone to anger, which is very common. People who like to eat pasta and pastries are generally not sentimental or emotional. From a health and hygiene perspective, we know that vegetables are good foods, but a word of caution about radishes: eating too many radishes at each meal can easily make one's temperament fierce and cruel.</p>
<p>From the writings of other authorities, we can also gather many explanations and examples. For example, it is said that people who eat fruit often have a mild temperament because fruit concentrates a large amount of sunlight. This is believable, and people are increasingly inclined to eat more fruits and vegetables because modern life drives people to concentrate on foods that are quicker to swallow. All fresh foods have stimulating and exciting properties, just like tea and alcohol. Therefore, being very careful and cautious about diet can not only avoid disease but also improve health and change temperament.</p>
<h3>Both Are Foreigners</h3>
<p>— Guan Ying</p>
<p>Every time I leave my workplace, I habitually rush back to my cage-like room and lie on the bed, ignoring everything. Today, I am especially happy and unwilling to go back so quickly. I wander aimlessly on the road, trying to release some pent-up emotions. Unfortunately, I encountered two unfair incidents in a row, which stirred up endless waves in my heart.</p>
<p>I passed the brightly lit night market on Nanjing Road and turned onto a quiet and secluded street. Suddenly, a group of people rushed out diagonally. Two disheveled foreign vagrants were fleeing towards this side, while two Chinese coolies were closely following behind, chasing them desperately while cursing: "Damn Russians..." "Catch them and I'll beat you to death..." The two Russians were unwilling to show weakness and turned around to fight back, still with the ambition to resist. At this time, several reinforcements joined the coolie side. The Russians saw that they could not hold out. Countless punches landed on their heads and backs. They had no choice but to run away quickly. Several coolies still relentlessly chased after them, and the onlookers shouted and cheered. Listening to their chaotic conversations, some said: "Those Russian bums are really annoying, they deserve to be beaten!" Some said: "They have no protection in Shanghai. No one will ask if they are beaten to death." In this complicated public opinion, I seemed to see the two foreign vagrants being grabbed and beaten again.</p>
<p>I crossed the Suzhou River very bored and headed towards my residence. I passed the dance halls and cafes with their green wine and red lights, heading towards that desolate and lonely corner. The biting cold wind blew against my face, and I couldn't help but shiver. Suddenly, I heard a sharp cry coming from ahead. I hurried over and saw a large crowd of people and a dozen rickshaw pullers gathered at the entrance of an alley. A foreign sailor strode into the alley. Listening to their conversations, it turned out that this drunken American sailor had just beaten the rickshaw puller who was now crying and complaining. The American sailor was completely drunk and jumped out of the rickshaw without paying the fare. The rickshaw puller chased after him to demand payment, and as a result, he received a few kicks and slaps. The rickshaw puller was in extreme pain. He had long been accustomed to the power of foreigners in Shanghai, so he could only cry out but not resist. Although many people and a dozen companions were standing nearby, everyone could only look at each other, not daring to express any unfair sympathy. They could only watch as if they were enjoying a show. On the way back, endless emotions surged in my heart, and two different kinds of foreign figures constantly flashed before my eyes.</p>
<h3>The Fourth Company Commander of the Northeast</h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 20: Calculating Good Fortune Brings Smiles to an Old Man, Endless Sorrow Dispelled as Old Friends Reside Across the Street</p>
<p>Seeing this, Ms. Jiang had no choice but to write and teasingly said, "I don't have many guests here. Old Master has many social obligations. You can estimate it yourself, right? How many tables of banquets do you want to have? How much should each table of the banquet cost to be appropriate?" She asked two questions in a row, which aroused Old Man Zhao's interest again. How should invitation cards be issued? How should wine be served? What grade of banquet should be used to feel acceptable? This triggered his speaking mechanism, and he spoke endlessly. Ms. Jiang came at twelve o'clock after lunch and talked until four o'clock in the afternoon. Old Man Zhao was still full of energy, with endless ideas emerging. Later, Old Master's errand boy, Xiao Lin, came in and said that the eldest daughter was calling in the room. Ms. Jiang thought of her own daughter, who was feeling unwell and perhaps lying down again this afternoon. How could I leave her for most of the day without checking on her? So she used this as an excuse to escape Old Man Zhao's barrage of words. Old Man Zhao was actually looking forward to his son getting married. This was truly a great joy. How could he let go of the thought? He was lost in thought, thinking this and that, and remembering many things. He planned all day long, and in the evening, he sat alone under the lamp and slowly wrote several letters. On each letter, there were sentences circled twice beside them. For example, "Upon receiving this letter, my son should prepare everything, set the date himself, and immediately inform me when he can take leave. I will arrange everything in advance according to the time of his arrival home so that a happy event can take place upon his arrival." Another example, "My son will soon be getting married, and funds are urgently needed. Please remit all the more than two hundred yuan that Brother has deposited as soon as possible. Brother will come to the city in person to collect it soon." Another example, "The funds are still far from enough, so I still beg my brother to find a way to raise them as soon as possible to meet the urgent need. I am extremely grateful and look forward to it." This old man's actions were not only exceptionally thorough, but he also spoke quickly. The next morning, he got up early and personally sent them out by registered mail. After sending the letters, he walked to the front yard and called out to the room through the window, "Old Woman Yang, are you home?" (268)</p>
<h3>Encroachment and Demolition</h3>
<p>— Jiang</p>
<p>Seas turn into mulberry fields, and mulberry fields turn into seas. A barren land has transformed into a bustling foreign settlement of high-rise buildings and mansions. In this era of vigorous construction, many residential buildings obstructing traffic in the city have been demolished and yielded land due to street expansion. In particular, several busy streets have been greatly expanded, causing houses to yield a lot of land. Some city houses have practically shrunk into wall cabinets, standing there in rows.</p>
<p>Due to the expansion of streets and the shrinking of houses, the value of land has become apparent. As a result, the barren land and high mounds of the past have instantly transformed into magnificent buildings and pavilions. The powerful people have even gradually turned ownerless public land and narrow official alleys into private property.</p>
<p>Because most people who encroach on public land are propertied classes, a group of archaeologists fulfill their grand ambition of preserving antiquity by searching for historical sites in the old gazetteers or maps of the past to provide protection. As a result, news of so-and-so encroaching on public land and so-and-so encroaching on official alleys frequently appears in newspapers.</p>
<p>However, those who strive to preserve antiquity do their best to preserve it, and those who encroach still encroach. Barren public land and useless official alleys, like the foreign settlements in Shanghai, gradually transform into magnificent buildings and mansions. The news of encroachment, although initially sensational and shocking, quickly becomes like discounted goods, becoming silent and odorless after five minutes. It is said that a group of archaeologists, in the midst of the shouts, have found grains of gold from the piles of old paper.</p>
<p>Demolishing and yielding land, encroaching and occupying land, in this era of great changes where seas turn into mulberry fields, those who are demolished are naturally filled with sorrow, but those who encroach are also extremely happy. In particular, the archaeologists have even more to do and profit from, vigorously engaging in the business of preserving antiquity for both fame and fortune. This is perhaps the unique characteristic of an ancient civilization in this era of vigorous construction.</p>

<h3>Second Day of the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Private Middle School Football and Basketball Championship: Jinling and John's to Face Off in the Football Final ▲Yesterday's Semi-Finals: Jinling Defeated Shanghai University, John's Defeated Yancheng ▲Basketball Preliminaries: John's Defeated Shanghai University, Soochow Defeated Zhejiang University</h3>
<p>-Tomorrow's Football Final, Basketball Semi-Finals Tonight- (Suzhou, 14th) Today was the second day of the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Private Middle School Football and Basketball Championship. The results of the football semi-finals were: Jinling defeated Shanghai University four to zero, and John's defeated Yancheng nine to zero. Jinling will play in the final on Saturday. In the basketball preliminaries, John's defeated Shanghai University, and Soochow defeated Zhejiang University. Details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Excellent Forwards: Jinling Overwhelms Shanghai University</h3>
<p>-Four to Zero- After the preliminaries on the 13th, where Jinling defeated Cuiying sixteen to zero and Shanghai University defeated Zhejiang University three to one, the two teams commenced their clash at 11:45 AM yesterday (the 14th) at the Soochow University field, establishing flag gates. This match was a contest for the right to enter the final, with immense implications for the championship. Judged fairly by Coach Feng, after several exchanges, Jinling's forwards dribbled the ball and advanced directly into the interior. Shanghai University's left inside-forward Li Zhaojian, eager to save the ball, intercepted it and kicked it high, flying towards the back. Blocked by the goalpost, it resulted in a left corner kick. Jinling's right forward, He Xueyao, took the kick, but it did not yield results. After some time, Jinling's right forward He Xueyao dribbled the ball deep, charging to the right wing, surrounded by Shanghai University's forces. He passed the ball, which landed in front of Shanghai University's net. Goalkeeper Lu Zhongyu palmed it out. Jinling's rescuer, Chen Shikai, burst out from the crowd to respond, kicking the ball into the net, creating the first record. At this point, Shanghai University tried to counterattack. Jinling pressed forward, and the ball swirled in Jinling's territory. Left-back He Xuequan fouled at the 40-yard mark, resulting in a penalty. Liang Kaibiao cleared the ball with a header. In three steps and two strides, they entered Shanghai University's territory again. Vice-captain "Little Black Coal" Chen Shikai and others surged in like a tide, breaking through three barriers. Shanghai University's goalkeeper Lu Zhongyu, seeing the situation, hurriedly left his position to save the ball, but he failed to catch it and fell to the ground. Liu Zuru flew forward and scored a goal. At this time, Jinling supporters erupted in cheers. With five minutes left in the half, Chen Shikai, single-handedly, launched another attack. When the ball reached the goal, Lu Zhongyu came out to defend, lying on the ground and holding the ball. However, he did not throw it back, and the ball was intercepted by Liu Zuxiu. Taking advantage of the fact that Shanghai University's inner defense was disorganized, he kicked the ball, making it three to zero, ending the first half. Changing sides to start the second half, Jinling changed personnel. "Black Skin" retired as center-back, and Zeng Yulong took over as right inside-forward, inevitably showing some inferiority. Shanghai University's defenders worked hard to defend, and Jinling could not advance. Shanghai University's Gong Ziwen took advantage of the opportunity to attack, making some surprising moves, but he was unable to succeed alone. After a long melee, Liu Zuxiu and He Xueyao advanced together. He Xueyao crossed the ball, and Zeng Yulong deliberately missed it. Chen Shikai, not to be outdone, shot the ball straight, hitting Lu Zhongyu and bouncing not far away. Chen Shikai intensified his efforts, making it four to zero. Jinling won, seizing the right to enter the final. ▲Jinling Formation Song Xipei Down Liu Zuru Up Zhou Lixian He Xuequan Chen Shikai Weng Liqian Guo Shaobu Up Liu Zuxiu Down Lin Jianxue Down Lin Jianxue Up Song Xipei Up Zeng Yulong Up Liu Zuxiu Up Zhao Aisheng Down Guo Shaowei Down Zeng Yulong Down He Xueyao ▲Shanghai University Formation Feng Yulan Chen Shifu Cai Shoxi Wang Jinhao Lu Zhongyu Li Shoukang Gong Ziwen Li Zhaojian Jin Shigui Cheng Tianjian Liang Kaiji</p>
<h3>Nine to Zero: John's Defeats Yancheng</h3>
<p>-Secures Final Spot- The match between John's and Yancheng became one-sided. Less than a minute into the game, a corner kick was awarded. Yancheng's Dai Guangjin kicked the ball high, and Liu Mingde jumped up and headed it back, creating a goal. Chen Huitang shot from afar, and Yancheng's goalkeeper gained possession but lost it again. Ye Deming took a corner kick, with a very good landing point. Yancheng's defenders were at a loss. Chen Huitang scored the fifth goal. Xu Wenkui cleverly dribbled past players, scoring the sixth goal on his own. In the first half, John's won six to zero. In the second half, Hu Chengji received a high lob from Sun Baoshan, turned around, and scored a goal, crisp and exceptional. Liu Mingde scored the eighth goal. Xu Wenkui kicked a corner kick, landing at Hu Chengji's feet. Hu Chengji reaped the benefits, scoring the ninth goal. Although Yancheng counterattacked, it was ineffective. John's won nine to zero, securing the right to enter the final. It is expected that there will be a dramatic match against Jinling.</p>

<h3>Eliminated in the Preliminaries: Cuiying Defeats Zhejiang University</h3>
<p>-Four to Two- In the preliminary round of the football elimination tournament, Cuiying overcame Zhejiang University four to two. Cuiying's victory was not easy. Their play was much improved compared to the game against Jinling. Although they could not fully conform to the rules, they were able to attack and defend. Zhejiang University took the field too carelessly and became flustered and confused after conceding, which led to their defeat. In the first half, Cuiying won two to zero. In the second half, it was a two to two draw. Cuiying's first goal was quite amusing. Cuiying requested a timeout, but the referee had not yet executed it, and Zhejiang University had already lowered their flags and ceased resistance. Cuiying then drove straight in, scoring the first goal. In the second half, the situation was equal. Although Zhejiang University made a final struggle, it was ultimately ineffective. Cuiying won four to two.</p>
<h3>Results of Basketball Preliminaries</h3>
<p>▲Soochow Defeats Zhejiang University In the early basketball game between Soochow and Zhejiang University, the players on both sides had not yet reached the highest level of skill, and there were many fouls, but most of them were missed. Soochow's Zhou Benrui scored twice, and Huang Shutian followed up with three points. Soochow took the lead with seven to zero. Zhejiang University called a timeout but still showed no improvement. Zhejiang University's Lei Weiju scored four free throws. After one point, he again threw a long shot. Soochow's forwards took advantage of opportunities on both sides, scoring frequently, and the score gradually widened. The first half ended with Soochow twenty-eight and Zhejiang University six. At the start of the second half, Zhejiang University was able to compete on an equal footing, and both sides scored. After entering the game, they showed signs of fatigue. Soochow's Zhou Benrui was indeed an outstanding figure, with skillful dribbling and passing. The defenders were also not weak, giving them geographical and human advantages. The victory came quite easily. The result was twenty-one to twenty-five, Soochow won. First half: Soochow 28 points, Zhejiang University 6 points. Second half: Soochow 23 points, Zhejiang University 19 points. Total: Soochow 51, Zhejiang University 25.</p>

<p>▲John's Defeats Shanghai University John's defeats Shanghai University, with a score of forty-eight to thirty-two. John's and Shanghai University were last year's champions and runners-up, and their strengths are considerable. The call for them to win the championship is also the highest. Once they meet, it's like a final. After the game started, Shanghai University's Huang Lifu took the lead. John's Xu Wenkui returned the favor. Zhang Peixin scored a long shot, and John's caught up with a score of four to two. From then on, John's led the way. Xu Wenkui and Chen Huitang swung left and right. Zhang Peixin and Tong Yuchun defended well, leading with a score of thirteen to two. Unexpectedly, Xu Wenkui injured his ankle. Shanghai University took the opportunity to enter directly. Zhu Peisheng and Huang Lifu scored consecutively, gradually catching up. John's Chen Huitang and Li Mingguang also made contributions. John's remained in the lead. The first half ended with John's eighteen and Shanghai University ten. In the second half, John's momentum continued. Chen Huitang and Li Mingguang scored under the basket, scoring four points in a row. Shanghai University's Yang Yuanqi scored another long shot. Xu Wenkui returned to form, and John's became active, like a fish in water, and the score increased sharply. Shanghai University's Jin Shigui and Yang Yuanqi fought like trapped beasts, also winning many points for Shanghai University. Especially Huang Lifu's long shots often hit the mark. When the score reached forty-six to twenty, John's Chen Huitang was sent off, and the forwards were inevitably weakened. Shanghai University launched a full-scale counterattack, which was effective for a time, and the score gradually closed. The result was forty-eight to thirty-two, John's won. ▲John's Fouls Points</p>

(2) The Municipal Party representative stated in his address that China's current population death rate is increasing, the birth rate is decreasing, and compared with the life expectancy of people in other countries, it is also the shortest.

This proves that schools pay attention to physical education on weekdays. We hope that the sports meet will progress year by year, that is, we hope that students' physique will progress year by year. For individual athletes, we should strive to create new records. For the entire student body, we should strive for general progress.

<h3>Western Youth Basketball Last Night: St. John's Loses to Jinan</h3>
<p>Shanghai Loses to Xiaguang; Three Games Tonight</p>
<p>Last night's Western Youth Basketball games saw three matches, all between Chinese teams. Shanghai defeated Xiaguang with a score of 62 to 29. Jinan defeated St. John's with a score of 42 to 24. A brief summary of the matches is as follows:</p>
<h3>Shanghai Defeats Xiaguang</h3>
<p>Although Shanghai's team is not at full strength this year, its overall power remains. Xiaguang was able to rally at the beginning of the match but quickly declined, allowing Shanghai to seize the opportunity to rise and win repeatedly, ending the first half with a score of 33 to 13. In the second half, Shanghai's teamwork improved, reaching an even better state. Xiaguang suffered a complete defeat, ultimately losing with a score of 62 to 29.</p>
<h3>Jinan Defeats St. John's</h3>
<p>Jinan's victory over St. John's was clear, as St. John's is not what it used to be. Most of its old team members have left, leading to a lack of direction in both offense and defense, which was the main reason for their loss. Jinan's coordination was more sophisticated, winning the first half with a score of 24 to 9. St. John's launched a fierce counterattack in the second half, but their energy was insufficient, resulting in a final score of 42 to 24 in Jinan's favor.</p>
<p>In the match between Moore and the Eagle team, the Eagle team lagged behind from the start due to their disorganization. The first half ended with a score of 23 to 11, and the overall result was 41 to 22.</p>
<p>▲ Tonight's Matches:</p>
<p>Mai Ling vs. Nanxing (Group A) at 7:00 PM</p>
<p>Rowing Team vs. French Army (Group B2) at 8:00 PM</p>
<p>Soochow vs. Russian Community (Group B1) at 9:00 PM</p>

<h3>Childhood</h3>
<p>— Ziming</p>
<p>Raging study of documents consumes middle age,</p>
<p>Yet it is the basis for future endeavors in this life;</p>
<p>Vividly recalling the unusual mental strength of childhood:</p>
<p>A lamp's red glow preceding the vastness of the unknown. - Ding'an Poem.</p>
<p>For those whose lives lack purpose, their youth and (childhood) are especially precious. This kind of romantic recollection isn't really about discovering the real wonder of (childhood), but rather a feeling of decline after (middle age). Originally, life is only once, it is precious to everyone. However, if his life is dissolved in the public, if he is always working for the world, then he is always growing, although aging, sickness and death are unavoidable, but his career – the public's career is immortal. He will appreciate the (eternal youth). And those whose (life is like a dream) take a lot from this world, but give very little to this world - he will one day feel tired of death: he doesn't even have the strength to take. The sadness of old age and incompetence weighs heavily on his heart like lead. How short is youth!</p>
<p>The loveliness of (childhood) is ignorance. At that time, everything is (knowledge), you can be a great scientist and a great philosopher every day, discovering new phenomena and new truths every day. What about now? (Everything) is already known, familiar, and everyone's face is already tired of seeing. The universe and society are so old and tasteless, even though they are actually much fresher than (childhood). So I miss (childhood) and pray for (childhood).</p>
<p>When you can't move forward, you want to take a few steps back to recover the future you've already traveled. Ask (ignorance) to come back and give me the joy of seeking knowledge. How terrible, this (cessation) of life.</p>
<p>The past is always past, and the future is still the future. What exactly are you lamenting - I ask myself.</p>
<h3>The Flavor of Autumn</h3>
<p>— Lin Yutang</p>
<p>In the autumn dusk, alone on the sofa smoking, watching the red light peeking out from under the white ash of the cigarette, faintly exuding warmth, the mood in one's heart follows the blue smoke curling upwards, equally relaxed, equally free. Before you know it, the curling smoke turns into strands of fine silk, slowly disappearing, and at that moment, the emotions in one's heart also sink into the vast world. So I won't talk about the mood at that time, but only about the flavor of the mood at that time. Wanting to strike another match, to relight the cigar that has already been lit three or four times, but because the white ash has accumulated too much, it can't be lit. So I gently flick it, the ash quietly falling onto the copper brazier, as silent as when I write with a brush on Chinese paper at this time, without a sound. Then I light it again, puffing out mouthfuls of smoke, the aroma assailing the nostrils, like nestling against beauty with warmth in one's arms. So I think of smoke, of this warm breath of smoke, of the hazy smoke filling the room, of the meaning of autumn. Only then do I remember that the meaning of autumn in poetry and literature has never been like this, what is associated with it is desolation, is bleakness, is the autumn fan, is the red leaf, is the barren forest, is the luxuriant grass. However, autumn does have another meaning, without the vigorous yang energy of spring, nor the fiery oppressiveness of summer, nor like winter's complete entrance into withering and decay. What I love is the antique grandeur and imposing scenery of the autumn forest. Some people scold others with "acting like an old man in autumn," which shows that they don't understand the taste of the antique charm of the autumn forest. Among the four seasons, I have a fondness for autumn, so I might as well talk about it. Autumn represents maturity. Spring's bright and delicate beauty, and summer's lush and dense depth, are all things it has seen and experienced, and are no longer surprising, so its colors are light, its leaves are mostly yellow, there is a feeling of antique and verdant vicissitudes, it is no longer simply competing for glory with lush greenery. This is what I call the meaning of autumn. Generally speaking, what I love is not late autumn, but early autumn, when the sultry heat has just dissipated, the moon is round, the crabs are fat, the osmanthus flowers are pure white, and it has not yet fallen into a state of stern desolation, this is the most worthy of enjoyment. The mildness at that time is like the red ash on my cigarette, just a warm and fragrant aroma. Or like a literati who has shed the shocking style of writing, and gradually tends towards pure maturity and attainment, with grandeur and firmness, his writing is deeply meaningful to read. This is the solid meaning of what Zhuangzi called "(obtaining autumn and all treasures are accomplished)." In life, the most enjoyable things are of this kind. For example, wine is best when it is mellow and old. Smoke also has the distinction of mildness and intensity. The best cigars are far superior to cigarettes, because their aroma is more harmonious. If it is lit properly, and slowly smoked to the end, watching the red light blaze, there is endless meaning. I don't know about opium, but seeing people burning it on a lamp, listening to the faint crackling sound, I also feel a kind of poetic sense. Generally speaking, all things that are old, pure, yellowed, and refined give me the same pleasure. Such as a blackened ceramic pot simmering pork on a stove with a slow fire, the sound of the pot slowly humming makes me feel the same interest as watching someone smoke opium. Or like a dictionary that has been used for twenty years and is not yet broken, or a desk that has been used for half a lifetime, or seeing a blackened, old-fashioned signboard on the street, or seeing the vigorous and profound calligraphy of a master calligrapher, all give people the same happiness. Life in this world is like the four seasons of the year, it must go through this mature period, like a woman who has developed healthily and experienced a smooth childbirth, she must also have a time of middle-aged charm, which is absolutely unattainable by young beauties. What I admire most is Duncan's wonderful line; "People only sing about spring and love, which is really unreasonable. You must know that the scenery of autumn is more gorgeous and magnificent, and the happiness of autumn is ten thousand times more majestic, surprising, and magnificent. I really pity those women who have narrow views, causing them to miss the grand gift of the autumn of love." Someone like Duncan can be said to be a person of taste.</p>
<h3>Deathbed</h3>
<p>— He Jiahui</p>
<p>Night.</p>
<p>My aunt's head was as swollen as a bucket; her eyes were reduced to mere slits; her complexion had turned from blue to black; there were many shiny spots like scars; her neck was swollen like a goose's neck full of grain, making it almost impossible for her to turn her head; the sore that constantly oozed blood and pus, along with her mouth, spewed out an unbearable stench.</p>
<p>My grandmother knelt beside her, surrounded by the entire family, listening in horror to her delirious ramblings:</p>
<p>"Oh, oh, oh... a soldier, he insists that I go with him, that scoundrel... look, isn't he standing right in front of me?...”</p>
<p>With a trembling hand, she convulsively pointed at my grandfather standing before her.</p>
<p>“It’s me, Xiaomei, how can you not even recognize me?”</p>
<p>Hearing this voice, she widened her eyes, as if searching for someone. But her eyes were already blurred, how could she see anything clearly? She didn't recognize that the person standing before her was her grandfather, nor did she hear his words, because she continued to ramble: "You're so funny, at such an old age, you're still so restless, kicking and making a fuss behind my feet, simply kicking the well-made bed that I painstakingly made till it's not left a trace of warmth...” Although she was covered in several layers of silk and cotton quilts, she shivered terribly, as if her bed had really been kicked open, causing her to feel bone-chilling cold.</p>
<p>"Just get a good night's sleep, and you'll be fine soon. Don't think about this and that!"</p>
<p>Staring at my aunt's face, my grandmother said with tears in her eyes. Normally, she was the most cleanliness-loving person, most unwilling to be close to sick people, she was simply the type of woman who would run away at the sight of leprosy sores. But in these final hours of my aunt's life, she did not leave this festering, shapeless face for a moment.</p>
<p>"Has Dr. Gan been here?"</p>
<p>My aunt suddenly asked very lucidly.</p>
<p>"He's eating downstairs, he says that as long as you rest quietly for a few days, you'll be able to walk."</p>
<p>"Really?"</p>
<p>"Of course it's true, who would lie to you?"</p>
<p>My grandmother lied like she was哄 a child, her eyes filled with tears. Although my aunt's face was swollen and purplish-black, hearing these words, it quickly radiated light, and those spots became especially obvious, her thin eyes seemed to be constantly smiling. Yet hope still seemed to stir in her heart, perhaps that old doctor with long fingernails and a long beard was still her savior in this critical moment; she thought so herself, and although others knew that the doctor had already refused to treat her, they hoped the same as her.</p>
<p>"Mom, I think I'll be able to walk soon, I need to pee..."</p>
<p>As if suddenly gaining strength, she shook her bucket-like head on the pillow, wanting to sit up and say that she wanted to go to the corner where the chamber pot was, to test whether she could walk herself. Everyone stopped her, telling her not to get up, because the chamber pot could be moved. But she firmly refused, struggling, pleading, insisting that her grandmother help her.</p>
<p>"I can already walk, I can already walk... that soldier..."</p>
<p>But as soon as she sat up, as if overwhelmed, she collapsed again. Her bucket-like head, stiff and terrifying, tilted to one side; blood gushed from the wound like water, emitting a suffocating stench; the pair of dead-fish-like eyes, following the weakening breaths, gradually closed together.</p>
<p>"Xiaomei! Xiaomei! Xiaomei..."</p>
<p>My grandmother shouted as if she was going crazy, but there was no echo to be heard anymore. Her blood turned cold, and the entire family's blood turned cold along with it, the withering of hope was truly swift.</p>
<h3>Literary Miscellany</h3>
<p>— Mengyuan</p>
<p>(One)</p>
<p>Mr. Zhou Zuoren has selected many jokes from the three books (Laughing House), (Laughing Down), (Laughing Well), and edited a book (Selected Jokes from the Bitter Rain Hermitage). At the end of the long preface to the book, he said:</p>
<p>"It seems that (humor) is prevalent in China today, which is not a good sign. A writer in Tsarist Russia said that satire is the language of slaves, which is very meaningful. When villagers meet and say that someone has become a (temple guardian), although it seems similar to the pawnshop clerks playing with the head as a bottom after being drunk and full, there is actually a dark background. Letting the people talk and vent their bad air, whether it is real pain or false complaints, is actually a sign of peace." After reading these words, I feel that Mr. Zhou Zuoren has also become a little unwilling to be lonely lately. Originally, Mr. Zhou was fearful of (talking about tigers), and then, (the tiger entered the deep mountains and did not come out for a long time), now, this big bug has turned into a (smiling face) to meet us, does Mr. Zhou also have unavoidable hardships? However, although it is a (smiling face), it seems that it is no longer the (tiger) it once was, which is ultimately a regret.</p>
<h3>Two Brothers (59)</h3>
<p>— Guy de Maupassant, translated by Li Weike</p>
<p>She laughed:</p>
<p>"Try it, and you'll see how it escapes through your shrimp net."</p>
<p>"But... what if you want me to?"</p>
<p>"I want to see you catch some shrimp... for now, I don't want you to catch anything else..."</p>
<p>"You're terrible. Let's go a little further, there's nothing here."</p>
<p>He held out his hand to her, helping her walk on the slippery rocks. She leaned on him cautiously, and he suddenly felt himself overtaken by love, his desire growing stronger, eager to possess her, as if the illness that was sprouting within him was waiting for this day to develop.</p>
<p>Soon they came to a deeper depression, where in the quivering, living water that flowed from an invisible crack towards the distant sea, floated long, slender grasses of strange and peculiar colors, pale red and green, like swimming hairs.</p>
<p>Madame Luc Duemil called out:</p>
<p>"Look, look, I see a shrimp, a big one, a really big one, over there!"</p>
<p>He saw it too, and resolutely waded into the hole, not even caring that the water reached his waist.</p>
<p>But the little thing, waving its long whiskers, slowly retreated before the shrimp net. Jean drove it towards the seaweed, thinking he could surely catch it there. When it sensed that it was surrounded, it suddenly jumped, slipped off the shrimp net, and disappeared through the mud. The young woman, who had been watching this pursuit intently, couldn't help but cry out:</p>
<p>"Ah! How clumsy!"</p>
<p>Embarrassed, he blindly dragged his shrimp net across a grassy seabed. When he pulled it out of the water, he saw that he had unintentionally netted three large, transparent sea shrimp in the invisible hiding place of the shrimp.</p>
<p>He handed them to Madame Luc with triumph, but she didn't dare take them, she was afraid of the sharp, tooth-shaped spines that armed their tiny heads.</p>
<p>But she finally decided to take them, holding their slender whiskers with two fingers, placing them one by one into the basket, along with some seaweed, to keep them from dying. Then, finding a shallower puddle, she timidly went down into it—gasping slightly because of the cold water—and started catching them herself. She was skillful and cunning, possessing the nimble wrists and hunter's alertness needed for shrimp catching. Almost every time, she caught some deceived sea shrimp that didn't escape because she drove them so skillfully and slowly.</p>
<p>Jean couldn't catch any shrimp now, but he followed her step by step, rubbing against her, bending over her, pretending to be extremely despairing of his own clumsiness, wanting to learn from her.</p>
<p>"Ah! Let me see," he said, "let me see!"</p>
<p>Then, when their two faces were closely reflected in the exceptionally clear water, which became a mirror-like surface because the black plants lined the bottom, Jean, looking at the head next to him looking up at him from below, laughed, sometimes throwing a kiss with his fingertips that seemed to fall on that head.</p>
<p>"Ah! You're so annoying!" the young woman said; "One shouldn't do two things at once."</p>
<p>He replied:</p>
<p>"I'm only doing one thing. I love you."</p>
<p>She straightened up, and said in a serious tone:</p>
<p>"Hey, what's gotten into you in the last ten minutes, have you lost your mind?"</p>
<p>"No, I haven't lost my mind. I love you, I finally dare to tell you this."</p>

<h3>Securities: Under the Selling Pressure from the Northern Gang, Public Bonds Showed Slight Signs of Weakness</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Securities Exchange market showed some signs of weakness. The Northern Gang was selling quite a bit, initially seeming to have little to do with the current situation. The central representatives in Guangdong had reportedly good news, but the market was still full of speculation, with both bulls and bears having their own observations, and neither able to escape their private opinions. Therefore, market price fluctuations were merely a matter of temporary bargaining chips. Slight differences in the weighting of bull and bear positions led to inconsistent trends in price increases and decreases. At the opening of the morning session yesterday, due to reports that the Southwest attitude was gradually approaching the central government, various gangs bought in slightly, but there was very little need from major players. Market prices were slightly better by 1 to 4 or 5 jiao, among which the "20 Roll One" type was still slightly lower by 0.05 or 0.1 jiao. The upward trend was already showing weakness and lack of power. In the second session, the bulls immediately changed their positions, and the market price uniformly fell back by 2 or 3 jiao. Only "Jin Chang" [a specific bond] uniquely fell by 7.5 jiao. The afternoon session still only had one round of trading. The Northern Gang sold quite a bit, and the initial selling pressure was quite strong. Various issues from the 18th and 19th years fell sharply by several jiao to more than 1 yuan. When trading the various issues from the 20th year, the downward trend suddenly slowed, only falling by 0.05 to 0.2 or 0.3 jiao. "Jin Chang" still rose by 2.5 jiao. The market price ultimately showed a uniform decline of 1 or 2 jiao to 6 or 7 jiao. "Jin Duan" [another specific bond] was still better, rising by 2.5 jiao. The trend situation was still mostly in a wait-and-see state. Major fluctuations should occur after the Southwest attitude is clarified, and the expected period is around the 20th. Let's wait and see. The total trading volume was 10,034,700 yuan, including 2,000 yuan in spot transactions. Futures included 3.15 million yuan in unified salt tax, 2.4 million yuan in troop reduction bonds, 1.405 million yuan in 19th-year customs bonds, 1.495 million yuan in 20th-year rolled and unrolled customs bonds, and the rest ranged from tens of thousands to 5 or 600,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Wheat Continues to Weaken; New York Stock Market Trends Lower</h3>
<p>The Sin Fung Foreign Firm reported on the 13th that the New York stock market was calm and slightly lower because bulls were taking profits and wheat continued to weaken. President Roosevelt is currently studying a plan for the merger of telegraph companies, so transportation stocks are relatively firm. US Treasury bonds are vigorous and firm due to the strong US dollar. German bonds fell sharply, and other countries' bonds were affected and fell across the board. Daily stock trading volume was 1.33 million shares. Furthermore, the Century Ironworks report states that the ironworks workload is currently at 31.5%, mostly to complete past orders. Road construction will not be able to deliver until the end of winter. Public buildings are the largest consumer, purchasing 28,300 tons, an increase of 5,000 tons from the previous week. Exports also increased, mostly to Welsh tinplate factories, it is said.</p>
<p>(Wheat) fell due to speculators selling off. Short positions are too large and should rebound. (Cotton) trading is light and sentiment is bullish. The Gold Settlement Agency's purchase price of gold remains unchanged at 34.01 yuan per tael. The Dow Jones Index is listed below:</p>

<p>11 Commodities 47.83 Down 0.60</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton Markings: Yarn and Cotton Still Loose and Falling</h3>
<p>The yarn market is flat and weak. Because there is no appropriate solution for the yarn stored in warehouses, even though there are organized bull companies, the sales of this cotton yarn are sluggish, and the overall situation is not good. Various regions are affected by financial drought, and purchasing power is greatly weakened, so although prices are low, there is still a lack of upward momentum. The future of the yarn market is still uncertain.</p>
<h3>Human Markings Dropped Another 6-7-8 Jiao</h3>
<p>The opening of the previous market for human markings was extremely flat. The various months rose slightly by 1, 2, 3 jiao. In the afternoon, it was heard that the sales of raw yarn were not high, and the market situation weakened again. The various months fell again by 7, 8, 9 jiao. The total trading volume for the day was 9,700 bales. It was found that Da Feng sold 1,450 bales, Yuan Da 650 bales, Xin Cheng 450 bales, and Yuan Tai 250 bales.

<h3>Raw Yarn Sales Turned Desolate Again</h3>

<p>Xiamen 10 Ningbo 5 Sichuan 110 Northern Gang 5 Tonghang 20 Mainland 206 Shantou 50 Guangdong 100 Changsha 15</p>
<p>The cotton market rose in the morning and fell in the afternoon. Because the Ningbo Gang continued to purchase in large quantities, the market situation was firm, but the yarn market was poor, and the factories felt extremely distressed. It was difficult to purchase raw materials because the outlet for cotton yarn was too narrow. However, most cotton merchants felt that its base had withered, foreign cotton could not be imported in large quantities, and Chinese cotton might be stable, so the idea of going long was particularly strong. There were reports that the US cotton purchased on credit by the National Government was being sold off cheaply.</p>
<h3>Zheng Markings Rose in the Morning and Retreated in the Afternoon</h3>
<p>At the opening of the previous market for Zheng markings, due to the slight increase in foreign cotton and the Ningbo Gang still purchasing in large quantities, the various months rose by 1 or 2 jiao. In the afternoon, due to the downward trend in the yarn market, people's sentiment was softer, and the various months fell by 1, 2, or 3 jiao. The total trading volume for the day was 75,500 dan. It was found that Da Fu sold 2,000 dan, Yuan Da 4,100 dan, Chang Ji 1,800 dan, Shen Ji 4,400 dan, Yi Feng 1,400 dan, Tong Fu 1,400 dan, Tong Ji 2,500 dan, and Chang He 1,900 dan.

<h3>Grain and Flour Tax Has No Benefit to the Current Flour Market</h3>
<p>Yesterday's flour market, after opening in the morning, the markets for various months initially flattened and then fell. Because foreign wheat quotations, Chicago fell by 0.40, Canada fell by 0.30. Therefore, the market sentiment was already not good at the initial opening. Later, because the factories gradually sold off, off-site bulls also believed that the tax on foreign wheat had been announced, and comparing the tax rates and other items, it seemed that there was no further use. Therefore, a part of it had been returned, and the market sentiment gradually loosened, falling by one or two points compared to the previous day. When it came to the afternoon opening, it was still flat and weak at first. Then, because the Northern Gang slightly moved on in the current month, the current sales there were still good, about 40,000 bags per day, so the market sentiment was still stable, causing the distant months. With raw foreign wheat still being sold continuously, white wheat was called for 3.86 yuan in the morning and 3.88 yuan in the afternoon. Red wheat was only called for 3.8 yuan, and the factories only offered 3.7 yuan, so there was no transaction. In this situation, the distant months are afraid that there will be little force to vibrate. As a result, the current month and January each fell by 0.02, February fell by 0.015, March fell by 0.0175, April fell by 0.015, and May fell by 0.0175, it is said.</p>
<h3>Foreign Wheat is Still Being Sold Everywhere</h3>
<p>Yesterday's future wheat market, after opening in the morning and afternoon, the market for various months was generally flat and weak. Because foreign wheat quotations, Chicago fell by 0.40, Canada fell by 0.30, the market sentiment was not stable after the opening. And because the tax on foreign wheat has become a reality, but in addition to government borrowing wheat, the origin of the wheat that was sold in China in previous years is still being sold non-stop. Until recently, the pricing has become more and more favorable. Because our country has increased taxes, foreign countries have lowered prices, and the market must be compatible in order to sell. With this situation, the market is difficult to develop. As a result, the current month was slightly better by 0.02, January was lower by 0.01, February was lower by 0.03, March was lower by 0.02, and April was lower by 0.05. The spot wheat market, transactions are very light, and the price is still stable. Nanjing wheat opened at 4.09 yuan, and Suzhou wheat opened at 4.25 yuan, totaling 300 bags, which were handled by Fufeng, it is said.</p>
<h3>Each Gang's Late Rice Suddenly Rose by Two Feet</h3>
<p>The source of rice in South Shanghai suddenly became scarce. The arrival of 20 hao [brands] of late rice (over 3,000 shi) and nearly 10 hao of thick japonica rice (over 2,000 shi). The market situation for late rice since yesterday's market seemed to turn, today, with limited arrivals and the taxation of foreign rice, the guest gangs' appetite suddenly became prosperous, and the situation was tight and quite active. In an instant, it was sold out. Those who did not have time to enter all chose thick japonica rice such as Leli, so the price of late rice for each gang suddenly rose by 2 chi [a unit of length, here indicating a price increase], which is truly a good sign that has not been seen in recent months. And each gang's thick japonica rice therefore also responded, and in addition to the still strong store appetite, the price rose by a jiao or so. Only Du Yang sharp rice still moved separately, without honor or disgrace. Yin Yuan and Bian Yuan rice showed a slight turn to flatness.</p>
<p>The Shanghai North River and Lower [areas] each had slightly more than 50 hao of goods. Various outlets in the market continued to digest, the market shape, white japonica rice, high-priced goods did not arrive, and the situation was fixed. Medium and secondary prices increased by nearly a jiao, and the prices of foreign Du Bu indica thin rice increased by several fen [cents]. The tone of white Yuan and Yin Yuan each indica rice was flat and weak.</p>
<h3>Taxation of Foreign Rice Stimulates the Rice Market</h3>
<p>Yesterday's guest indica rice market situation, because the taxation of foreign rice has been clearly ordered, the market sentiment was very good. Even each producing area reported increases, and there were also off-site hoarding households purchasing and hoarding in each producing area. The reported price of production was large, and the source was reduced. The Shanghai market price also called for a large near jiao increase. However, incoming households are still watching, so there were not many transactions throughout the day. The market gradually built up, and most of the digestion was from Fujian province. A total of 150 bags of Hunan engine oil were handled from Xiamen, priced at 7.6 yuan, and 200 bags of engine Jing were handled, priced at 7.33 yuan. 150 bags of Wuxi engine rice were handled from Quanzhou, priced at 7.2 yuan. 350 bags of Wuhu Yuan rice were handled from Ningbo, priced at 7.82 yuan to 7.68 yuan.

Zhenjiang has also recently opened about 300 pieces, priced from 15 yuan to 12.5 yuan, depending on the quality. The Fujian gang has not handled it for a month. Yesterday, it was heard that there would be a shipment. If it is handled, the market price can definitely turn around, because the current market is already a low price, and whenever it encounters strong sales, it can be expected to rebound.</p>
<h3>Metals: 3-400 Dan of Green Lead Opened</h3>
<p>Yesterday's metal transactions were still light, but the buying and selling of green lead was quite lively, so as many as 3-400 dan were opened. Its price was estimated at 16.1 yuan per dan, slightly lower by 0.1 yuan compared to before. And the buyers were mostly local printing houses such as the Huang Dan Factory and paint companies. Because of the current situation, most have not purchased. The customer gangs, such as Tianjin, Hankou, Jiujiang, and Anqing gangs, except for inquiries, very few actually made transactions. In addition, the recent transactions of Hunan native lead were also limited, and the market situation had not changed, estimated at 15.8 yuan per dan.</p>
<h3>The Relationship Between Silver Prices and China's Price Level (Continued) by Louis Zhang Luluan</h3>
<p>In the summer of 1933, the Temporary Agreement on Increasing Silver Prices was signed in London, England, by representatives from nine countries, including the United States, China, Peru, and India. If this agreement is formally established, (1) then important silver-using countries in the world, such as China, India, and Spain, must not sell their total silver volume exceeding 160 million ounces within the next four years, and (2) other important silver-producing countries, such as Mexico, Peru, Malaysia, Australia, Canada, and the United States, etc., should also purchase and stockpile 140 million ounces of newly produced silver by their respective governments or central banks within four years. However, according to the average annual amount of silver sold by the central banks of the above countries during the thirteen years from 1920 to 1932, it only reached 41.5 million ounces per year, so this suggestion can quite indicate that it will definitely be able to increase the considerable demand for silver in the future, because after offsetting the two, there will only be an increase of 5 million taels of silver per year.</p>
<p>The voice of adopting silver as currency is now quite high in Mexico, the United States, and various states in South America. Judging from general public opinion alone, there are also quite a few people who tend towards this suggestion.</p>
<p>In short, even if there is a policy of not using silver as currency in the future, but if it is desired to restrain the decline in silver's purchasing power and raise China's price level, its effectiveness is feared to be minimal. In the long term, according to Professor Sant's (Carl Snyder) research, we know that when silver's purchasing power decreases, the index of the amount of silver stored in the world is far behind the index of the quantity of major raw materials in the world. From 184 to 1914, the world's commodity production increased by about 3.15% per year. During the European War, due to the impact of the war, the world's raw material production suddenly decreased. After the war, its usual rate of increase will be restored. Unfortunately, it suffered another setback from the world economic depression in 1929, and the production of raw material commodities decreased again.</p>
<p>If the countries of the world gradually get through this difficult opening of the depression, the usual annual rate of increase in the production of raw material commodities may still be restored. If it is desired to still maintain silver's inherent stable purchasing power, then the quantity of silver used as currency must still remain unchanged. The annual rate of increase in the amount should also be at least 3.15% to be reasonable. However, according to the estimates in 1932, the annual production demand for silver is about 479 million ounces, and the production in 1929, although it had broken the historical record, in fact, the production volume was only 260.9 million ounces. The production volume of silver in 1932 is estimated to be only 150 million ounces. From this point of view, if we assume that countries will not adopt silver as currency in the future, even based on the current silver production volume, it is not seen that it can increase three times annually, keeping pace with the rate of increase in goods, in order to restrain the index of silver's purchasing power from no longer increasing.</p>
<p>(3) Increasing the Purchasing Power of Silver Can Cause Chinese Commerce to Decline. People who advocate using silver as currency often believe that increasing the purchasing power of silver can increase the purchasing power of the entire country of China in the world market. However, collecting various evidence, the result is quite the opposite. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>After the Crackdown</h3>
<p>— Qu Chen</p>
<p>It is recorded that: (To change customs and habits, nothing is better than music.) Music's ability to cultivate human nature is superior to any other art form. This is because all sounds of nature are inherently felt by the heart. Unlike painting, sculpture, and other arts, which require various kinds of knowledge to appreciate their beauty, music is the most universal art. No form of beauty is greater than music.</p>
<p>Ancients also said: (Words are the voice of the heart.) Therefore, music is not only a work of art but also a sincere expression of national character. In countries with a strong and enterprising national character, the popular music tends to be inspiring and uplifting. When we hear "La Marseillaise," we seem to see the passionate emotions of the general public during the French Revolution. Similarly, when we hear "The Volga Boatmen's Song," we can imagine the steadfast and progressive spirit of the Slavic people. In countries with a relaxed and disorganized national character, the songs are mostly sighs and laments, lacking vitality. Such as the songs popular in modern China, like "I Love You..." and "Sleeping..." Therefore, ancient people could understand the national conditions of various countries by listening to songs and poems, which is by no means an unfounded claim.</p>
<p>Du Yan, the Censor-in-chief of the Tang Dynasty, said: (When Qi was about to prosper, they created "Companion Song"; when Chen was about to fall, they created "Jade Tree Flowers in the Back Courtyard," the sound of which was mournful. People on the road who heard it would weep.) The current "Drizzling Rain," "Lullaby," and others are probably no better than "Companion Song" and "Flowers in the Back Courtyard." The situation in the times of Qi and Chen is somewhat similar to the present. Thinking of Du Yan's words, one cannot help but feel a chill.</p>
<p>I don't know if my auditory organs are different from others, but I feel nauseous when I hear the popular songs nowadays. It's like having a bucket of cold water poured over my head, making my hair stand on end. Recently, however, my neighbor installed a radio. Thanks to the "neighbor's" blessing, I have to listen to lyrics like "(Selling flowers!...) (Sleeping...)" every day, every night, whether I want to or not. Having to listen to it is really giving me a headache, and my aversion to that kind of song has deepened even more. Because of this annoying sound, I often remember when I was studying in ××, I would open the dormitory door early in the morning, take a book, and go to the nearby city wall to breathe and read in the light of the rising sun. At that time, there was always a melodious and heroic military bugle call coming from the distant military camp, carried by the breeze, giving people a sense of refreshment and inspiring thoughts of riding a horse on a long expedition and galloping across the northern desert. This scene and feeling are forever etched in my memory. The pleasant feeling given to me by the millions of popular songs I have heard over the years cannot compare to hearing the bugle call even once. But I have no choice; I am still surrounded by this atmosphere and unable to fulfill my desire.</p>
<p>Recently, the authorities seem to be paying quite a bit of attention to this. Previously, the Nanjing Municipal Government banned "Drizzling Rain." Reading the Nanchang dispatch in the tenth day's newspaper this month, I learned that the Jiangxi Provincial Department of Education is also cracking down on music that is harmful to public morals. It has been decided to strictly prohibit Li Jinhui's records from circulating in the province and to send personnel to inspect gramophone records in various movie theaters and to crack down on the sale of these records in stores, with the intention of completely eliminating them. This is a good thing. This kind of song, which is a disguised version of "Eighteen Touches" and "Hitting Teeth," should have been eliminated long ago. But we are not thinking about it for the sake of "public morals," but for the sake of noble entertainment and the future of the country. This kind of song is a product of the old times and is not suitable for the needs of the masses in the new China.</p>
<p>But music is something needed for the spiritual entertainment of life. After the crackdown, what should be done? Is it enough to just prohibit singing? If there is no new and better alternative, it will still rise again. Otherwise, someone will create a similar version, and you will never be able to ban them all. The result will be that the ban is only for those who impose it, and people will sing anyway. The effect is obvious. Therefore, if we want to change customs and habits, we must raise the level of music appreciation of the general public and create good songs. This is the most important and essential issue at present. We cannot blame our musicians for being too few in number, and so far, they have not composed a song that suits the needs of China in this era for the masses to sing.</p>
<h3>The Price of a Leg</h3>
<p>— Mu Lang</p>
<p>Yesterday, an evening newspaper carried a news item titled "One-Legged Soldier Buys One Shoe":</p>
<p>Guangzhou, 12th – A soldier who lost a leg in the Shanghai Battle went to a shoe store to buy one shoe. The store owner refused, resulting in an assault. The soldier was then handed over to the court. The court ruled that shoes must be bought in pairs; refusing to sell one shoe is justified.</p>
<p>A lifelong journey on the path of life</p>
<p>After reading this news item, everyone will have some thoughts. Some people will think that the shoe store owner is too mean; some may think that this matter is very dramatic and enough to make digestion after dinner easier; some...</p>
<p>I naturally also have my own thoughts.</p>
<p>The soldier is said to be from the 19th Route Army. However, it doesn't matter, who cares if he is from the 19th Route Army or not? In short, my observation and conclusion on his actions this time are:</p>
<p>He is a useless, black-hearted person who only knows how to calculate petty gains.</p>
<p>How can I say this? He only wanted to buy one shoe, of course, because the price of one shoe is cheaper than a pair. Otherwise, why would he assault the store owner because the store owner didn't agree to sell him one shoe? But if one shoe of a pair is sold, the remaining one is equivalent to being discarded. Who can it be sold to? If we cannot wait for another person whose foot is damaged in the opposite way from that soldier (and the foot size must also be the same), then the store owner is bound to lose money. But businesses do not do business at a loss. Therefore, I believe that the store owner's refusal to sell to the soldier is perfectly legitimate and the action taken is very appropriate.</p>
<p>That soldier must have sacrificed his leg in the Shanghai Battle in order to save some money on shoes. His calculations are extremely petty!</p>
<p>But is it really worth it to exchange a leg for a shoe? What's more, this transaction was not successful, and he has already paid the price unilaterally. That's why I say he only knows how to calculate petty gains, so he is a useless, black-hearted person!</p>
<p>Apart from this, I can't find a second reason that would make him willing to sacrifice his leg. I really want to know this, and I also hope that a second reason exists, but I can't find out how. If anyone thinks that there is a second reason, then I must first ask this gentleman:</p>
<p>He sacrificed his leg in the war, but what is the reward he received? (22·12·13)</p>

<h3>Shanghai's Exotic Mood and Chinese Style</h3>
<p>— Zilin</p>
<p>(Shanghai is full of many exotic moods) Many young people who have received a Western education and have a literary hobby always like to say this.</p>
<p>Indeed, young people who have never been abroad can indeed experience some Western flavors in Shanghai. There are beautiful displays, red and green flickering advertising lights, elegant cafes, nightclubs, dance halls, bars, and residential areas along Route Ghisi, with red gauze lamps leaking from the curtains, and the silhouettes of Western gentlemen can be vaguely seen coming and going in the rooms. At night, a burst of piano sounds spills out from the residences and reaches the ears of young men and women strolling side by side in the French Park and Ghisi Park. Indeed, wealthy young men in Shanghai can enjoy all the comforts and entertainment of modern people.</p>
<p>But these exotic moods do not evoke any feelings in me, who has lived abroad for a long time. On the contrary, what I feel when I come to Shanghai is the other side! That is, Shanghai's Chinese flavor.</p>
<p>Let's take the example of foreign cities. For example, in Hamburg, there are masts arranged like forests, the strange cries of cranes with rattling ears, the sounds of steam whistles and trains, the faint sound of machinery from factories, and the smoke billowing from the tall chimneys... all of these make people feel that it is a modern industrial city. But what about the Huangpu River in Shanghai? Apart from a few warehouses along the river, there are only a few scattered factories. What you see first on the Huangpu River are foreign warships, flying various national flags, pointing the muzzles of their cannons at both sides of the Huangpu River. In the distance, you can see the Cathey Hotel and several other large hotels standing tall, but if you look at the other houses next to them, they are pitifully small. On the Bund, there are many vehicles and horses coming and going in the distance, and thin rickshaw pullers are dragging their poor legs, racing with 20th-century Ford cars. Next to the pier, a large group of coolies are carrying things, and the waiters who greet guests swarm forward and clamor as soon as a ship arrives. Here, we cannot see any exotic mood at all, but rather a completely (Chinese) landscape, a semi-colonial landscape.</p>
<p>Walking to Nanjing Road, horrifying (great) street signs are fluttering along the street, and the words "Great (Clearance Sale) at this store" are written on the doors. The big stores hire orchestras to play tunes by Li Jinhui and the like to attract customers and maintain their reputation. Fish and bear's paw, both are what I desire. Shiying works</p>
<p>a precarious life. If you stand at the entrance of the Wing On Company and take a look, then we can see that at the intersection, there are not only cars, trams, bicycles, and rickshaws, but also two-wheeled carts and wheelbarrows being pushed, all of which are insignificantly sandwiched in between the many wheels. If London and Paris are also as crowded, they are indeed not as complicated as Shanghai. This place is indeed full of a strange urban flavor that combines ancient and modern, Chinese and foreign.</p>
<p>If you have been to Rome, then people will tell you that each city has its own color. Then, near the Fourth Road in Shanghai, we can smell a different aroma from each store. For example, when you pass by a Chinese medicine store, you can smell the aroma of Chinese medicine. When you pass by a cured meat store, you can smell the aroma of cured meat. When you pass by a place that roasts fried chestnuts, you can smell the aroma of chestnuts. When you pass by a restaurant, you can smell the aroma of chili peppers. When you pass by a sauce garden, you can smell the aroma of sauce. If you take a circle on these roads, I guarantee that you will fill your nose with a mixture of these various aromas. Also, if you are a poet like Baudelaire, then I guarantee that after inspecting this place, you can make poems that (have flavor in the poems). But these are still our old Chinese goods after all, without any (exotic mood) in them!</p>
<p>Also, in the North Sichuan Road area of Shanghai, you can see Japanese sailors with bayonets and majestic attitudes. In the French Concession, we can see many Annamese soldiers (?) wearing slanted hats. At the crossroads, we can see many British police officers and red-headed Ah Sans commanding the situation and directing as they please. These people are much more handsome than our local Chinese soldiers. This is probably also considered an exotic mood. But this kind of exotic mood is a Chinese-style exotic mood. I have not seen such an exotic mood in Europe!</p>
<p>Unfortunately, these Chinese flavors of Shanghai have been forgotten by many high-class Chinese people who have lived in Shanghai for a long time. They are chasing after the extravagance of exotic moods!</p>
<h3>De Copa and Women</h3>
<p>— Dalu</p>
<p>French novelist De Copa came to China. In Shanghai, they were busy holding receptions for him, carrying grand news reports, and publishing (special issues). In Nanjing, he was also (given a banquet to wash away the dust) by important people. But when he arrived in Beiping, he was scolded by a female writer as a (literary rogue) and was warned. The reason is that in Beiping, he still did not talk about literature, but talked about women, and even expressed his ambition to marry a Chinese woman. This angered the new romantic female writer (a female intellectual) and she wanted to lodge a serious protest. (See the Shen Bao on the 11th)</p>
<p>Although De Copa has been to the United States more than ten times and has been to Argentina, India, and Morocco, he has not been to China, so he really does not understand the hearts of the people (especially women) in our ancient country of China enough.</p>
<p>We (Chinese women have always valued propriety and righteousness). Although (modern women) now (wrap their clothes around their bodies), (propriety and righteousness) are still maintained and not lost. This (the beauty of the East) may not be understood by De Copa alone. Even those who have lived in China for a long time and study fine arts may not understand it thoroughly.</p>
<p>(Chinese women are most beautiful in Suzhou), indeed. But (noble Suzhou women) are even more beautiful. (Singers like Xue Yanqin) cannot be (representatives of Suzhou women). De Copa was (fascinated for a few days) by (Xue Yanqin)'s (graceful demeanor). He should (have long conversations with noble Suzhou women) and recognize them as (independent people) (?). But he must not (speak nonsense) and (talk about marriage without talking about love). You must know that (French youth talk about love, and Chinese youth also talk about love).</p>
<p>De Copa knows that (Chinese food is very good and Chinese women are very beautiful). This is very one-sided. He does not know that Chinese food tastes good only when it is chewed carefully; the beauty of Chinese women can only be understood after (long conversations).</p>
<p>Otherwise, even if he (prepares to remain single for forty or fifty years...and sees a very beautiful Chinese woman), he still cannot (change his mind and marry a Chinese woman).</p>
<p>De Copa is really a (literary rogue). He does not know (the beauty of the East) and yet he talks about (the beauty of Chinese women being indescribable). After being (warned) by the female writer this time, he not only has (substantial material for writing a novel), but he can also get (the person he wants in his ideal love). This, of course, depends on whether he can work hard to explore the humor of Chinese women.</p>
<h3>Amateur Mailbox: No Sooner Settled Than Yearning to Move</h3>
<p>Dear Editor,</p>
<p>I got married at the age of 25 and am now 32 years old. Due to economic pressures, I have been running around, never stopping, so since I got married, I have not lived with my wife for even half a year in total. Fortunately, my wife is very understanding and has not blamed me for this, and often sends letters to encourage me. I have now found a job in Shanghai with a monthly salary of 40 yuan. Although the amount is small, I can avoid the suffering of running around from now on, and I get along very well with my superiors and colleagues. I save money on food and clothing every month. What is left over is enough for household expenses, but if this continues, my wife can barely understand, but in terms of human relations and reason, it seems unreasonable. If I bring my wife to Shanghai to live with me? But the cost of living in Shanghai is high. After thinking about it, 40 yuan is definitely not enough to cover food, clothing, housing, and transportation. Because I have no good background and am uneducated, I really cannot find a better job. I have thought about it over and over again and cannot find a solution, which really makes me feel stuck. You are the compassionate vessel of society (always responsive to requests). Please give me some advice. I am very grateful. Best wishes for your well-being. Yours truly, Wang Zhanlu</p>
<p>× × × × ×</p>
<p>Editor's note: According to the current cost of living in Shanghai, with a monthly income of 40 yuan, one's own meals, if they can be provided by the workplace, then it is already possible to barely support a small family. The material enjoyment may feel slightly strained due to moving to Shanghai, but the spiritual gain is enough to compensate for it. Wang Jun said that after thinking about it over and over again, 40 yuan is definitely not enough, probably because the family burden is too heavy or there are too many mouths to feed. We agree that you should save as much as possible on other expenses, and bring your wife to Shanghai to live with you, as long as you do not build a debt platform. As for wanting to find a better job, that is certainly also a solution. However, this can never rely solely on a kind of longing, and lamenting that you have no good background, or that you had few opportunities to study in the past. We should seize the present moment and strive hard. We are only afraid that the hero has no place to use his strength. If you have a job, don't be afraid of how bad it is. After all, you have a direction to work towards. With continuous effort, even barren land can be cultivated into fertile land, let alone your current position, which is not enough compared to the top, but more than enough compared to the bottom. To be disgusted with a place as soon as you have a place to live is the biggest obstacle to success.</p>

<h3>Shanghai (18)</h3>
<p>— Zhang Laosan</p>
<p>Thirty-Two Months</p>
<p>Sleeping hazily, I don't know how many days have passed, but my heart is very clear. There are many people gathered around my bed. They hired a doctor for me. My arm seems to have been pricked, but everything is not as free as I imagined. I can't speak, I can't turn over. It's like I've gone to another world, all blurry.</p>
<p>Every time I open my eyes, there are always people streaming in and out in front of the bed. I can only nod my head to express my gratitude for their kindness and care. My cousin also comes once a day. She has forgotten the changes in that (love triangle). She and Sister Min are talking and laughing very warmly. When they see me wake up, they serve me diligently at my bedside, or deliberately tell a story from our childhood: catching fish, touching clams, painting our faces black. This series of events seems like we have returned to our childhood. No matter how tired I am, I always have to pull myself together to interject a sentence or laugh, so that they don't feel disappointed.</p>
<p>The days in sickness really pass by so quickly. It's pitiful to say that I haven't lived such a comfortable life in three years. Every day a doctor comes to feel my pulse and prescribe medicine, and Sister Hui and Sister Min prepare tea and meals for me on time. However, every day I hope that my illness can be cured. Gao Fei is naturally even busier with the affairs of the society. He has taken my place and is also planning all the directions. When I see him come to my bedside every day, he is always in such a hurry. I really want to talk to him, but he always stops me, telling me to rest and recuperate, saying that as long as I get well, it doesn't matter if he is (busy).</p>
<p>I spent two months on my sickbed. The hot summer is also coming to an end. The sound of cicadas is no longer as noisy as it used to be. It seems to feel the sorrow of autumn coming. But I am able to barely get out of bed and walk back and forth in the room a few times. My brother brings many newspapers for me to read every day. Sometimes he tells me that a certain movie is very good.</p>
<p>(How do you know?) I looked at Sister Hui and Sister Min and smiled.</p>
<p>(Little Huang asked me to go see it.)</p>
<p>(Children always take advantage) Sister Hui said.</p>
<p>(Sister also said she would take me to see dancing) My brother pointed at Sister Min (yesterday she said).</p>
<p>(Do you have money to treat people?)</p>
<p>(I do!) My brother quickly pulled out a silver dollar from his pocket.</p>

<h3>The Love Story of Norma Shearer (Part Two)</h3>
<p>— Si Ying</p>
<p>(3) Budding Love Leading to a Happy Marriage</p>
<p>From then on, Norma Shearer devoted herself to her work. She studied, watched carefully, and learned diligently, and before she knew it, her probationary period was over. One afternoon, after a day of extremely hard work, Norma went to see the general manager in that large room. The general manager, as always, smiled and handed her a new contract. She read it carefully from beginning to end. After reading it, she said, "(But -)" The young general manager said to her very kindly but firmly, "(Perhaps that's not the salary you were hoping for - perhaps your work is worth more; but, Miss Shearer, these are the best terms we can offer right now.)" Norma, of course, had her own opinion. They argued for a full half hour. Later, Norma said indignantly, "(Fine, I'll sign it. But I must tell you, this isn't the first contract I've ever signed. I've also signed a contract with Universal Pictures, long before I signed this one with this company!)"</p>
<p>Thalberg laughed heartily when he heard this. Then Norma suddenly remembered something - she remembered a letter she had written the night before to a stranger. She remembered his name! She suddenly asked, "(Are you Mr. Thalberg?)" Thalberg looked at her beautiful face, which was flushed red, and said, "(Yes.)" Norma said, "(Are you telling me to sign this contract now?)" Thalberg said, "(Of course.)" So Norma happily signed it.</p>
<p>Of course, once Norma's beauty and status were recognized, everyone began to pursue her. Occasionally, she accepted their invitations. But, although everyone flattered her in every possible way to win her favor, whether by sending flowers, sweets, or singing praises, they could never move her heart. On the other hand, she had a secret hidden deep in her heart. Every night, after finishing her day's work on the set, she had to climb the very high stairs and pass the door of that large room before going to her own dressing room. Then she would always stand at the door of that room for a while. If she didn't do this one day, she would feel a sudden sense of loss in her heart.</p>
<p>After a long time, one afternoon, she was putting on makeup, preparing to go to the set, when the phone suddenly rang. With her face covered in greasepaint, she quickly answered the phone with a smile. It was Thalberg's secretary. He said that Thalberg had left a message, asking if she could go with him to the premiere of a major film that day. Of course, the premiere of a major Hollywood film was a very solemn occasion, and all the major stars would be there. Norma had no reason to refuse to go with a famous producer. So she happily agreed, and that was the first time Norma Shearer and Thalberg went out together, and it was the happiest day of her life.</p>
<p>Thalberg also felt deeply in love for the first time in his life. And Norma was already deeply immersed in love. When Norma's mother asked her the next morning what she had seen the night before, she was completely at a loss, because the events of the night before seemed like floating on clouds, and she couldn't remember anything. This was the scene when they had known each other for three years and first tasted the sweetness of love. From that night on, they often went out together, dancing, dining, racing, watching plays, swimming, and they gradually became inseparable. Then the inevitable thing that had happened for thousands of years happened. One night, after they had danced four times, he asked her in a low, breathless voice, "(Norma, darling, I have a confession to make to you. I love you so much. And I've been thinking that you are really the only woman in the world for me. Can you marry me, Norma?)" Dear Norma's face immediately flushed. She whispered a word in Irving's ear, a word that Thalberg had never heard so sweetly since he was born with ears. That word was "Yes." (The End)</p>

<h3>Review of "Bedtime Story"</h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>A Bedtime Story</p>
<p>- Grand Theatre -</p>
<p>Since "The Merry Widow," Maurice Chevalier has unexpectedly occupied an important position in the audience's memory. This is by no means accidental, but a clear reflection of the ills of society.</p>
<p>In this situation, Chevalier is able to attract sophisticated audiences with his sophisticated style, and he has become an invaluable talent for producers.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the reason why a small number of film audiences welcome Chevalier is precisely because they are too monotonous and always have to find a way to pass the time. And the so-called more convenient way to pass the time is to go to the cinema to see Chevalier, just like seeing Laurel and Hardy. Of course, this kind of audience will not live apart from the current society; conversely, Chevalier and others will not emerge in response to the times.</p>
<p>Everything is formed inextricably from the economic structure.</p>
<p>○　○　○　○</p>
<p>Since he is a famous and money-making actor, the screenwriter naturally has to create a script especially for him. This is by no means without reason. However, here it is discovered that the screenwriter is truly capable, and can actually come up with a script so suitable for Chevalier's personality. Isn't that right? He is made to flirt with women nonchalantly, and he sings a few light songs. These are all Chevalier's specialties, and they can also make the gentlemen and ladies smile happily.</p>
<p>However, here we do not see any initiative, nor do we see any sketches of life. At most, there is just such a story that fills the blank of several thousand feet of film - and that is the screenwriter's ultimate goal.</p>
<p>However, if someone says that poor couples cannot afford to raise children and have to abandon them in cars to save their lives... and the same child, after changing environments, is actually pampered and well-cared for... can it be said that this is completely meaningless? Then, I would say: yes, there is a little bit of meaning, but it has been dissolved by all the levity and has disappeared into the air. Although it exists, it is the same as non-existence. Moreover, this is ultimately a very small unexpected gain for the screenwriter, and it will not be understood by people who do not have the same life feelings as the biological parents of children.</p>
<p>○　○　○　○</p>
<p>Furthermore, the director cannot be said to be without talent. For example, Chevalier unbuttons his clothes to feed a baby, repeatedly unbuttoning his outer clothes and then his vest, making the audience laugh. Later, he takes out a valuable watch, and the audience laughs; the watch is dropped and broken by the baby, and they laugh again; and then three watches are dropped and broken one after another. It doesn't matter that three watches are dropped and broken, as long as the audience laughs, it's a success.</p>
<p>In addition, he dresses the child in adult clothes and puts him to sleep in a large bed, slowly moving the camera back, making the audience burst into laughter. This is indeed a confident and clever achievement. There is nothing more to say, it is a mediocre and popular comedy.</p>
<h3>Adventure in Iceland</h3>
<p>— Review of Moore</p>
<p>"S.O.S. Iceberg" - New Light -</p>
<p>Regarding films like "Adventure in Iceland," even the cinema advertisements state that it is "(an initial policy of imperialist expansion). (See the advertisement for this film)," but they cleverly defend it by saying, "(It is better to say that it is the astonishing harvest of the sacrifices of the European expedition). (Ibid.)" Like this "Adventure in Iceland," it can naturally be said to be an "(astonishing harvest)," because it was filmed in the icy and snowy land of Greenland, a Danish territory. However, in this kind of sparsely populated place (where there are only natives), our film crew brazenly went to work, and it is better to say that they were "(loyal to the money bag)" than "(loyal to art)." Moreover, in addition to this, what is the use of even revealing the effect in the advertisements?</p>
<p>However, the significance of this "Adventure in Iceland" cannot be compared with other adventure films. The reason is naturally because it was filmed in a bitterly cold area, and at the same time it was filmed on location. Not long ago, American planes desperately flew to Northern Europe, and European icebreakers struggled to navigate in the Arctic Ocean. The purpose was to find out if there were any unexpected routes in the icy and snowy land to hunt down that "(Siberian bear)!" This "Adventure in Iceland" also has this significance. Therefore, although the story of "Adventure in Iceland" is simple, its effect is completed without any regrets. It is said that currently aviation experts are preparing to connect Greenland to Europe, which is a strong illustration of this.</p>
<p>Naturally, the production of "Adventure in Iceland" focuses on photographic techniques. For example, the panoramic view of the iceberg is on the one hand the accumulation of the spring ice layer, and on the other hand the use of editing. This is what Pudovkin calls "(cinematic space)" in his film directing theory. Originally, almost all films of this kind rely on cinematography without exception, and this "Adventure in Iceland" is just more successful. In other "(ice and snow adventure films)," we can often see the rampages of wind and snow, which is the easiest way to shock the audience. In this "Adventure in Iceland," although it is not very visible, it already makes people feel a chill.</p>
<p>I remember "The White Hell" was also a similar film, but its sound effects were particularly successful, shaking the souls of the audience with the vibration of the howling wind and heavy snow, making the audience almost feel like they were in the same icy and snowy land as the people in the play. This is naturally the specialty of a famous director, and "(Adventure in Iceland)" cannot compare. If we want to cite the failure of "(Adventure in Iceland)," it would be in this area! Although the sound of the ice hitting can be heard, it does not match the plot or the tone of the play.</p>
<p>Laudila Loerch's performance is quite successful, but only average.</p>
<h3>Yuan Meiyun's Two Lovers</h3>
<p>— Bi Fu</p>
<p>Until now, I have finally discovered the most innocent female star in the film industry, and that is Yuan Meiyun, the protagonist of "Rage of the Chinese Sea Temple."</p>
<p>Usually, even when she says a word, she is very innocent, and at the same time very amusing and makes people laugh. What happened yesterday is even more interesting to write about.</p>
<p>A director smiled at Yuan Meiyun and said, "(Do you have a lover?)" Yuan Meiyun replied without any hesitation, "(Yes.)" The director never expected her to answer, and even say that she had one. This was as novel as Columbus discovering the New World. He immediately asked, "(Then who is it?)"</p>
<p>"(Who is it? I don't want to say.)"</p>
<p>"(Miss Yuan is shy?)"</p>
<p>"(What's there to be shy about? I have two lovers.)"</p>
<p>This sentence was even more intense, and it caused a sensation among many people in the director's office. Everyone pressed her to say who it was. She immediately picked up a cup of tea on the table, took a sip, and said slowly, "(My two lovers are my dad and mom!)" (End)</p>
<h3>Film Novel Little Women (10)</h3>
<p>— Su Yin</p>
<p>While Meg was arguing with her aunt, Brooke came back, forgetting his umbrella. Therefore, everything Meg and her aunt said was heard by him, which was enough to make him overjoyed. Later, Meg ran blindly to the parlor with tears in her eyes, thinking that Brooke had already left and would never see him again, but someone suddenly stepped forward and hugged her, startling her. It turned out to be Brooke. Brooke said, "(Baby, is what you said true? As long as you allow me a chance to love you, I'm not afraid to wait until I can start a family.)" Meg whispered, "(Yes, John)." They hugged each other tightly, their hearts beating together.</p>
<p>At this time, Jo sneaked down the stairs, wanting to hear how Meg would reject Brooke, but she didn't enter the parlor, and she had already seen them hugging like a stone statue. She ran back upstairs. From then on, time seemed to fly by. Until one day, Meg and John were married in the March family's garden, and the pastor was Mr. March. After the wedding, the newlyweds left for their new home. Jo paced alone at that old gate, feeling lost, thinking of the happy days between her sisters in her childhood, which had gradually drifted away like flowing water, and she felt infinitely desolate. Laurie gently walked up to her, took her hand, and comforted her. Jo felt truly grateful, but when she saw Laurie's face, the dazed look in his eyes, she understood what it meant, and she became afraid again. She asked herself if she would not make him happy. He should marry a beautiful, talented, and sociable woman to be the mistress of a large family. Moreover, their personalities were different. One liked socializing, and the other hated it; one liked writing, and the other opposed it. They often argued, and then reconciled, and loved each other even more deeply. But, when it came to marriage, that was another matter! Therefore, despite Laurie's desperate pleas, she always refused. Finally, out of disappointment, Laurie said angrily, "(Fine. You say you won't marry. I know you will marry. One day you will meet a good-for-nothing fool, you will fall in love with him, marry him, and be his slave for the rest of your life. I'll be waiting to see!)" After speaking, he jumped up and left. Jo chased after him, shouting at him, but she saw him running away without looking back, and she knew that this proud Laurie would not come again. So she leaned on the pillar at the gate and cried.</p>
<p>Grandma was very clear-minded. When Jo came in and said she was going to go out, she coldly watched the gradual flowering of the romance in the garden; she also felt that Jo's romance was difficult to blossom. She asked Jo softly, "(Do you really not love him?)" Jo said, "(I love him. I love him deeply. I make him sad, and my own heart is also like being cut by a knife. But I am afraid of taking a wrong step...)" She sobbed. Grandma patted her shoulder and said, "(Jo, your idea is right. This is good for both of you. You can go out for a trip to relax and get some fresh air. I'll talk to your father about it. If he doesn't object, I'll write a letter to Mrs. Gardiner.)" (To be continued)</p>
