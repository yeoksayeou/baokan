<p>德魯蒙否認提新建議語涉含混</p>
<p>小國代表對我表同情共起非難</p>
<p>（南京）國聯於調解絕望之際、忽傳所謂新妥協案、一味遷就日本、我所提修正案未予考慮、亦不與我代表接洽、經顏代表嚴重抗議、各小國代表一致反對、國聯知對我未可橫加壓迫、已聲明新妥協案祇係特魯蒙與杉村之私人接洽、不能認爲國聯公意、同時日亦聲明不能同意、至十七日下午形勢陡變、新妥協案已吿失敗、聞十八日開會時、將正式聲明調解絕望、即根據十五條四節草擬報吿書、内容雖未悉、但據外交當局十七日語記者、不論國聯處理中日爭端採取何種方式或條件、凡與我國不利者、我决堅决拒絕、至相當時期將有更儼重之表示、（十七日中央社電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）日代表團觀察國聯形勢、以爲政府關於妥協案之訓令一到、中日問題之審議吿一段落、即以設立小委員會問題爲中心、開始中日直接交涉之預備交涉、對於前途極爲樂觀、然頃形勢俄然變化、不許斷其逆轉、其原因有二、中國代表顏惠慶關於特魯蒙所草妥協案、向希孟議長提出抗議、其一也、愛爾蘭等小國代表亦與中國取同一態度、表示强硬、非對特魯蒙專擅修改决議草案之越權行爲、其二也、特魯蒙於本日委員會避其責任、謂杉村對余表示某種案、詢問委員會能否接收該案、余僅開陳與對他會員國同樣之意見而已、西門外相亦撫慰小國代表、謂關於中日問題之會談、現已吿一段落、現在妥協的中段如歸失敗、則開始援用某十五條第四項之規定、即西門外相擬召開大會審議調解手續之計劃已失敗、似覺悟不得不採用第四項規定、國聯今晚發表之聲明書中、謂調解失敗時、將依據第十五條第四項處理中日問題、此事現頗惹起各方面之注目、（十六日日聯電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）十九特委會今日午後集議、未有驚人發展、不過衆信調解失敗、其第二步驟在準備盟約第十五條下關於此項爭議之報吿耳、會議僅一小時、專聽取國聯秘書長德魯蒙報吿上屆會議後設法接洽之經過情形、特委會將於星期三日再行開會、屆時日政府關於草議案之覆文、當可送達日内瓦、故星期三日之會議、將爲極重要之會議、德魯蒙對特委會說明關於中代表顏博士來函抗議其方案之地位、德魯蒙否認渠曾提出任何建議、並聲明國聯副秘書長杉村曾來晤談、詢渠是否認若干提議可爲特委會所接受、渠答以渠當以對待國聯其他會員者對待之云、會衆旋討論應否向新聞界發表否認文、但最後議定關於一般情形之文吿、應於會議後發表之、一面又决定函復顏博士、說明實在地位、吿以特委會方面並未向日本發出任何提議、並聲明特委會不欲無期等候、而不根據盟約第十條進行第二步驟、聞此聲明係英外相西門所建議者、愛爾蘭代表勒斯特稱、特委會每次休會、輒遇一次或二次之戰事、此次休會亦復如是云、主席希孟於休會後吿新聞記者、此將爲特委會最後一次調解之努力云、從今日會議之情形觀之、時局顯已倐轉惡劣、其故大都爲中代表顏博士抗議所謂德魯蒙方案者之一函、及若干小國否認任何人有權擅改十九特委會議案之態度、德魯蒙對特委會否認渠曾有何舉動、但向新聞界發表之文吿、則對於此點語涉含混、惟無論如何、調解之氣象、已切實無望矣、希孟與西門今日皆覺有對於詢問者確實吿以休會時所預期者業已失敗之必要、其意殆謂不能不從速召集國聯大會、按國聯大會現遇有屢次勸勉雙方握手但卒歸失敗之紀錄、如欲待東京覆文爲任何協議之基礎、則目前似嫌太遲、故十九特委會惟在向國聯大會報吿其使命之失敗、而由國聯大會依據盟約第十五條第四節着手草擬報吿耳、（盟約此節條文、「倘爭議不能如此解决、則行政院經全體或多數之表决、應繕發報吿書、說明爭議之事實、及行政院所認爲公允適當之建議」）按此條文而發動之手續、未必確含有對日决裂必不可免之意、後事如何、將視此報吿書之形式與性質而定、依照目前現象、報吿書大槪將以十九特委會議案與理由說明書爲根據、換言之、此報吿書亦即將以李頓報吿書之條陳爲根據也、是以星期三日將爲極重要之一日、</p>
<p>今晚七時二十五分、特委會發出公報、由希孟署名、内稱十二月二十日特委會曾表示意見、以爲非至竭盡其調解努力、並表示極力忍耐、以圖解决之證據後、則其責任尙未履行完畢、今日特委會證實此種見解、並表示意見、以爲如根據盟約第十五條第三節條文之手續、不幸失敗、則不得不儘速解除一九三二年三月十一日决議案所賦予之任職、而依照盟約第十五條第四節繕具報吿、查十二月二十日集議時、特委會曾見有關係方面已因主席希孟與秘書長德魯蒙從中斡旋而進行談話、並覺此種談話須經過若干時日、嗣後除中政府有新提議外、未接有他種新提議、日代表團與主席及秘書長談話時、曾聲明正與東京政府接洽日後提交十九特委會之新提議、今日得悉日代表團可於四十八小時内接到其政府之意見、特委會以爲在極短時期内切實查知國聯大會能否履行盟約第十五條第三節所賦予之任職、實屬必要、故不得不依允此項短期之休會云、（十六日路透電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）國聯方面一般輿情、以爲昨日之决議、等於哀的美敦書、即雙方必須接受十二日二十日十九特委會之决議、否則食其後果、大約决議案以通過李頓報吿書爲限、國聯將採用盟約第十六條之意見、或須作羆、事有可注意者、英外相西門首先建議、如日本覆文不美滿、則進行第二步、但衆信覆文將予人以一種佈置之機、有此佈置、則美俄兩國之不加入調解委員會、不致成爲不可收拾之障碍、惟若日本仍要求不言及「滿洲國」、則定將毁滅諒解之可能性、因各國對於此點、堅持不讓也、（十七日路透電）</p>

<p>（南京）關於國聯十九委員會對中日問題最近之措施、外交部長羅文幹十七日發表談話如下、上年年終國聯十九委員會草擬之决議草案與理由書、中國業已表示不滿、並提出修正各點、而日本于國聯休會之時、竟復攻佔山海關九門口、積極準備攻擊熱河、並威脅平津一帶、國聯鑒于日本之積極侵略行動、早應認識中日問題已無調解餘地、而即採取有效步驟、以制裁日方之暴舉、乃最近國聯方面復將上年所擬之决議草案、再加修改、减輕其力量、商請日本同意、而同時不與中國接洽、一若决議案如經日本同意、中國政府必可接受者、此事業經中國代表團向國聯警吿聲明中國仍堅持去年之主張、如决議案違反我方主張、萬難接受、並對於國聯先與日方接洽聲明異議、現我方深信國聯不致不顧其自身之地位、而遷就侵暴者之意思、但如國聯强使中國接受不能同意之决議、則政府必致堅决之訓令于我代表團、（十七日中央社電）</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3 id="c21">英日果妥協乎 <a href="#c21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>— 晦</p>
<p>㈠英日妥協事實如何</p>
<p>「密勒評論報論英法對日密約有云。『···英法顯因彼等在上海擁有巨大利益。而日本之攻擊。使此等利益大受損失。故情願允許日本。如退出上海。即許彼在滿洲自由行動······。』此種論斷。出諸美人之口。似尙不免有若干感情作用。未得事實證明之前。不敢必其爲事實。而本月十三日之倫敦泰晤士報。竟稱日本所提之中立條件爲「妥協精神。」則不能令人無疑。昨報略已論及。蓋自一九三二年一月二十八事變迄今一年。國聯調查團調查之結果。對東北被侵占問題。並無適當有力之解决。荏苒至今日國聯匪特無裁制日本之力。抑且無裁制日本之意。是以十九國委員會所起草之妥協案。第一决議第一項中。尙以爲「國聯第一任務在努力調解紛爭。而今日之事態。···尙未達勸吿含有關於紛爭之事實與解决案之時期···。」日本軍國主義。無故用兵。鐵騎十萬。蹂躪三省。迄今一年又四個月。國聯各會員其未聞知耶。今年元旦之夜。又復砲轟山海關。今且蹴破九門。侵占熱河而窺平津矣。何能謂爲『尙未達勸吿含有紛爭之事實···。』不知必如何而始可謂爲「紛爭之事實」也。察其内幕。乃不在事實之紛爭如何。而在英日間之有何默契</p>
<p>㈡中英間之經濟關係</p>
<p>日軍侵襲東北。製造所謂「民族自决。」成立非驢非馬之傀儡國家。而號召世界曰。意在防止赤俄之南侵。爲資本主義在東亞之長城。英國亦以爲必如此始能保印度之安全。防中國之禍亂。鞏固其在華利益於久遠也。豈知日本之「大陸政策。」貪得無厭。前年僅云遼吉經濟利益。去年即侵入北滿西及錦義。今年又陷楡關。意在　東以至熱河。設使日本之侵略成功。北寗路之利益焉能必保。開灤煤鑛又豈可長享乎。匪特此也。華北市塲。恐將不免爲滿洲第二。英人之經濟勢力。殆不免盡被驅除。</p>
<p>更有甚者。中國有待於外資之開發尙多。中英之間又稱友善。英國對華投資數在二億五千三百二十萬磅以上。前途且具莫大希望。蓋中國需資本而英國有遊資也。然而日本近二十年來。乘歐洲大戰之便利用我國政治之紛亂四處挑撥。其對華投資。亦及於二十五億日金。除鐵路投資不及英國博大外。金融資本及輕工業建設。在長江以至華北。均駕乎英吉利而上之。如再加以政治勢力之扶殖軍事力量之强行傾消。則老大之英帝國。恐不免欲求安全而反得危害。</p>
<p>矧日本政府。詭詐異常。素有二重外交之稱。近且大倡東亞門羅主義。其於南華各地。其於印度。均極力與當地人民表示好感。多方買好扶助其獨立。以肆其經濟侵略。及政治發展之野心。不識英國何以竟認敵爲友也。</p>
<p>㈢對日默契認識錯誤</p>
<p>英人明辯利害。熟權是非。其於印度之民族運動。尙寄與若干同情。圖英印間之和平。</p>
<p>中國積弱雖久。而禍亂之餘國民死中求生。奮力圖存。决不屈服於日本之暴力。今後更將努力於自已更生之道。冀有所貢獻於世界。蓋有四萬萬羣衆之力。必能有以自救。英人於此。當有眞確質實之澈底覺悟。第一應認識目前之中國。正亟力猛進。决非二三十年可比。第二應認識中國設使完滿成就其理想的建設。充分開發實業。於英國匪特無害。且經濟上互益必多。第三應認識中國之對日爭鬭。實爲民族的生死存亡關係。苟日本立即放棄其侵略政策。則東亞和平。始可永保無虞。如英國不幸而助日抑華。以爲可以求一時之安。結果必適得其反。日本兼併東北之後。東亞已全局震動。再侵華北。則中國將化爲修羅塲。世界和平。能保持者幾何哉。第四應認識中國人民勤苦耐勞具世界各民族所難能之强忍力至必不得已而發爲必死之爭鬭。雖延續若干世代。亦所不辭。中日之間。鑄就百年不解之民族仇恨。實非世界和平前途之福</p>
<p>英國此時。正宜絕對中立。不應遷就眼前日本武力所鑄之惡事實。而助長其兇燄。使東亞糾紛。愈不可解遷延至於危害世界和平。。損壞英人自身之利益。勿誤認華人之隱忍爲至愚。以日人之　預爲可恃</p>

<p>日本昭和八年度戰爭預算（日本通訊）</p>
<h3 id="c83">黷武政策與準備攻俄歲出膨脹與財政危機 <a href="#c83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>近年以來、日本勞苦大衆的貧窮化、與日俱增、而日本政府八年度的預算、歲入不過十二億圓、歲出却達二十二億三千七百萬圓之鉅、這表示出日本帝國主義者是怎樣的站在破產危局的面前顫慄着、及它企圖如何能迴避這個可怕的危局、預算中歲入的大宗、爲租稅·（五六％）官業·及官產、（三六％）一九三○年惟因恐慌與貧窮、頻年不絕於日本社會、使勞苦大衆不能繳納租稅、且占租稅之五六％的間接稅繳納者、也因爲大衆購買力的减退、與消費品銷售量的减退、而損及其繳納額、（一九三一年）同時、大衆的貧困、又使烟草等的專賣利潤减少、故歲入自一九三○年來、亦有怨激减退之勢、同時、歲出的數額、因爲戰爭情勢的切迫、也不得不大有增加、所謂「赤字預算」（出超預算）的出現也有三年之久了、而八年度預算中歲出入不均衡的加息與財政膨脹的情形、却是從未曾有過的、</p>
<p>關於八年度預算、御用的報紙說、膨脹的原因有三、第一·軍事費膨脹、第二·時局匡救費、第三·公債費的膨脹、</p>
<p>（軍事費）第一·軍事費即指滿洲事變費與兵備改善費、滿洲事變費、是撥充滿洲國防上及治安維持上用的、這無論松岡洋右在國際聯盟席上怎樣的巧於雄辯、但「滿洲僞國」完全是日本帝國主義卵翼下的傀儡、這個事實是無可否認的、日本帝國主義者「御造」了這個僞國後、又爲它担負這麽巨大的預算、日本政府原是軍閥懹裏的娟姑娘兒、所以自然也不惜爲軍閥戰爭而投下多額的資金、開通道路啦、敷設鐵道啦、把松花江方面的依蘭及富錦武裝起來、準備爲將來與蘇聯打仗的要道、更以齊齊哈爾爲其出發點、經過大興安嶺、外蒙共和國·海拉爾·至滿洲里、以進攻西伯利亞、而日本的勞苦大衆、却壓榨出自已的血稅、爲這種目的之使用、</p>
<p>其次、爲兵備改善費、總額達二億　九百萬圓、其中、</p>
<p>在陸軍方面、</p>
<p>在滿兵力的充實、及國内部隊的改編、　　一三八·一三七○○○圓、</p>
<p>補充敎育、九·二九一○○○圓、</p>
<p>諸短期緊急制度的改善、一二·○九二○○○圓、</p>
<p>作戰資材的補充與整理、八七·八五○○○○圓、</p>
<p>在海軍方面、</p>
<p>新艦維持費、一五·一九五○○○圓、</p>
<p>航空隊航空兵器等經費、一五·五九四○○○圓、</p>
<p>艦艇制造費追加額、一五·○○○○○○圓、</p>
<p>艦艇改裝費、二○·六八八○○○圓、</p>
<p>兵備充實改善費、二一·七一○○○○圓、</p>
<p>陸軍部大臣荒木氏大聲疾呼地說、「我們要征服世界、國防與兵備充實費、是絕對不可缺少的」、這句話、現在已經到達實行的步驟了、不信、你們請看、</p>
<p>樺太·豐原的大飛行塲計劃、</p>
<p>大泊丨豐原丨至蘇聯邊境、這條國道的大修改與武裝計劃、</p>

<p>富山縣·濱黑崎候補飛行塲的敷設、</p>

<p>舞鶴港的大改築與大演習、</p>
<p>廣島縣、忠海毒瓦斯工場與北九州一帶防空設備的實施、</p>

<p>台灣·台南州·東石郡·候補飛行塲的劃定、</p>
<p>佳冬飛行塲的地區擴大、</p>
<p>長途汽車道路的敷設與改築、</p>
<p>台北與馬尼刺之間無線電的連絡、</p>
<p>日石會社的錦水石油增產計劃等等、</p>
<p>兵士待遇改改善中、已經實施的、爲將校生徒的增加、戰車隊的改編、幹部候補生制度與特科下士制度的成立、及最近爲要鎭壓軍隊内部的動搖、養成一種「勇士」隊、</p>
<p>這種鉅額的軍事施設費、與現在最活躍的軍需品工塲、互始勾結、對於一切工人、施行其非常强度勞動政策、又因日本各軍需品工廠、大都是國家的機搆、於是他們便藉「戰爭」啦·「非常時期」啦·等名詞、强制的實施其軍事管理、以拒絕一　經濟的與政治的要求、（未完）</p>

<p>諒不致有何重大變化、但日人詭計多端、此計不行、或將暴露其猙獰之面目、向他處擾亂、或竟因此引起世界二次之大戰、亦未可知、此則我民族應有之覺悟、早爲預備者也、最近或無大戰、將來不戰則已、戰則各地同時爆發、軍人固以致命疆場爲天職、但其他各事不能不希望民衆羣起努力、共赴國難去、</p>

<p>新聲社南京訊、二十一年度全國海關稅收情形、經總稅務司呈報到京後、當局尙未正式公布、惟據財部方面非正式宣稱、去年全國海關稅收總數、共約關平兩萬萬兩、較前年稅數總數减少約三千六百萬兩、其中滬地一處、所减少者、竟達千五百萬兩之多、其餘减少數目、爲東北海關及其他口岸之損失、東北所損失者、完全爲該處海關爲日人所撰奪之故、該處海關在三月以前者、尙有少數收入、至上海方面之所以减少者、完全爲受戰事影響、我國去年海關稅收雖减少如此之多、然對於償付内外債及賠欵等、均能如期照付、未有絲毫之延宕、此亦足證中國政府之對内外信用也、稅由短少、固屬我國政府之直接損失、然視此亦可知各國在華商業、因日本之黷武所受影響之一斑矣、</p>

<p>發展常業之根本、特命營船兩科會派專員、組織調查水脚委員、尅日赴上下游各埠詳查實情、以憑核訂標準運率、</p>

<p>覆：讀羆來信，自然，又使我們發生無窮憤慨！尊夫人的話，沉痛之至！固然，誰也知道那話是不對的，但又誰也沒法拿出事實來反駁。可是，我又要問一聲，這現狀又能夠維持現狀呢？那我們又欲吿訴尊夫人，這多久是斷斷不會長久的！我們這社會，現在正堕久了沒落之深淵，無怪的，四面是黑漆一團。而一些不久就將「壽終正寢」的人們，也似乎感覺到他們天國裏已經發生了劇烈的動搖，而同時又不明白這劇烈的搖動以後，是一個什麽世界丨在他們想，也許仍是他們的丨於是，享樂，縱慾，支配了他們的一切，在這一刹那間，就加倍暴露他們的「醜惡」，盡情發揮他們的「獸慾」，消磨他們最後的命運！這，說好一點，是「廻光反照」，說壞一點，是「速死」！尊夫人單看見了他們的享樂面，沒有看到他們陰暗面，覺得他們現在還是一些天國裏的人，其實，不久他們就要「下葬」，這片刻的享樂，正是他們喪鐘的前奏曲！這裏，我們得自已問：我們還是情願跟着他們走進墳墓去呢？還是另外去找我們的光明在道，去開闢我們的樂園？假使願意跟他們鑽進墳墓，那儘管你追求片刻淺薄的享樂去，否則，我們還該要吃我們的苦！窮不算一會事丨這窮字相信不久就會從字典上逃去丨一個人至於怕窮，他就算是完了，自然，飯是我們要吃的，然而「要飯吃」决不是「怕窮」，這又要分辨淸楚，現在我們一方面是要竭力去開拓「光明」，一方面要推送這「炎凉的世界」加速毁滅，這工作，也許是艱鉅的，唯其艱鉅，我們就該有加倍的努力！這一點，我希望你們同你尊夫人都能認淸。足下又問：覺醒該有什魔步驟？請你重看我答復孫君原函，有這樣的下文：問一問爲什麽大多數人吃盡痛苦而不得一飽，或願吃苦。而無苦可吃？爲什麽少數人並不吃一點苦而得「安富尊榮」？足下能夠回答這疑問，便是覺悟了」，這裏面並不要有什麽「步驟」，祇要能夠知道你的「吃苦」；由來就得。至於說：討債人絡繹而來，怎樣對付？那我們在前一函已經說過：就是可還則還，還不起由他，憑我怎的，你只不睬，他們又怎樣？自然，能夠原諒你的苦衷，同你婉商辦法，你也應該歡迎的，不然的話，你斷斷不必怕他們！心裏也得放寛一點，絕對不要憂慮，就使你憂慮萬分，討債人是誰也不會原諒你的呵。</p>

<p>丨潘局長在紀念週發表政見丨</p>
<p>上海市敎育局長潘公展於昨日（十六日）在該局紀念週演說、由汪大煦紀錄、演辭如下、</p>
<p>本年度第一學期現在將屆結束、本人覺得對於本市的中小學校、有許多感想、姑且把扼要說一說、</p>
<p>因爲學期結束、是吿一段落的意思、故敎育局考　各市立學校一學期的成績、也就在此時、往往於此期間、有許多市校校長頗不自安、同時另一方面、間或有希望得一相當職務以自効者亦多紛紛活動、因此之故、不免有些奇怪現象發生、從敎育行政方面着想、因爲學期結束、敎育局對於市立學校加以整飭、實行奬懲、其目的原在推進敎育、完全根據本局平時視察所得之結果、惟處置稍一不當、或竟反致發生流弊、養成一種習慣及普遍的心理、以爲要做校長及保持位置者、非同敎育局職員接洽不可、流弊所屆、必致校畏不能事專心辦學、而以大部份時間奔走於敎育局之門、僅以極小部份時間處理校務、如此則學校何能有良好之成績、甚至學校之中、因聞校長或有更變、敎職員亦不免連帶成爲問題、工作懈怠影響兒童學業、實非淺鮮、此種觀念、實屬錯誤、須知本局考　各校成績、全憑各校長敎職員之能否盡職以爲斷、成績優良者、自應令其繼續任職、其成績毫無辦理不當者、亦决不能因奔走之勤、及一二人之情面、而不加以糾正或更調、忍令犧牲學生學業、所以市立學校校長中、儘有十分努力、成績具在者、祇須保持其努力之精神、向前苦幹、本局自當予以可能之助力、絕對不必因學期或學年結束、而自起無謂之恐慌與紛擾、</p>
<p>本局每月領用八九萬元之市欵、究竟所做何事、社會敎育方面、姑置不論、至學校敎育方面、無非一部份辦理市立學校、一部份監督私立學校、現在本市私立學校、辦理不善者固屬不少、理應取締、然亦確有辦理得法而具有成績者、就本人的感想所及、覺得要監督私校、應先從整頓市校着手、市校如果成績良好、當更求其進步、以作私校榜樣、若忽略市校、而單想從嚴監督私校、實在並不合理、因爲市校成績不良、不獨不能監督私校、且可以喪失本局之威信、在此時期、本局應致全力於市校、於最近期間、祇要不背敎育法令、應在可能範圍以内、任其有自行充分發展之機會、其有絕對無法改良而專以營利爲目的者、自然祇有斷然予以取締、</p>
<p>其次地方敎育行政機關對於中央頒布之一切敎育法令應當遵照、自不待言、但有許多時候、亦須顧及地方情形、斟酌辦理、蓋因我國幅員之廣大、各地風俗人情之差異、及人民知識程度之不齊、事實上萬不能刻舟求劍以做到劃一、卽以本市狀况及其環境而言、自與内地不無相異、英文算術兩科程度、因需要之急切、當較其他内地爲高、此實無庸諱言、且以情理而言、敎科書之適用於甲地者、未必盡能適用於乙地、若全中國各省市地方敎育行政機關、不懂通權達變之道、祇知部定辦法、絕對不能伸縮、於是削足適履之事將致層見疊出往往便各學校流於作僞完全注重表面文章、辦成一種形式主義之敎育、就余本人感想所及、現在應反過來多注重實質、譬如本局審核各校新生挿班生學歷一事、其工作之繁瑣、輾轉費時、究其實、結果祇發現若干僞造證書及塗改之證明書耳、若一律重實質、不僅僅重文憑、注重各校入學考試、嚴格取締投機營業之學校、扶助發展優良學校、則所有留存之學校、爲顧及校譽計自必不願濫收　等學生、而欲求倖進之學生、雖有文憑、尙須經過嚴格考試、方能轉學、則文憑等於廢紙、僞造證書之機關、自然消滅、投機營業之學校、不勞取締而自難存、在此特就其徒重形式中之一端言耳、其他更僕難敷、坐令敎育行政機關、耗費多數人之心思才力、於無謂之形式、於敎育之實質、將見毫無所進益、如果此種重形式風氣、一變而養成重實質之風氣、則敎育前途、定可樂觀、故余以爲地立敎育行政機關、應負起責任、須在依照、中央敎務法令之範圍中、斟酌地方情形、處理一切事務、而不必祇知拘泥於紙面上之形式、我們要把大部份精神、用之於敎育實際之改進、庶幾無負於上海市之市民、</p>
<p>希望本局同人完全明瞭本人所提出之改革本市敎育方針、先從整飭市校入手、市校都辦得確有成績、則從嚴監督私校、必事半而功倍、</p>

<h3 id="c181">梵王渡勝華東 <a href="#c181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>昨晚友誼賽結果</p>
<p>五十七比三十四</p>
<p>約𦒋大中學合組之梵王渡籃球隊、昨晚與華東公司籃球隊、作友誼練習比賽於約𦒋籃球房、結果梵王渡以五十七比三十四獲勝、上半時三十二比十五、兩隊將於明日上午再作第二次練習比赛、</p>
<p>梵王渡合作熨貼　梵王渡爲約𦒋附�</p>
<p>中（本屆西靑乙組錦標隊）與大學部混合組成之球隊、惟陳祥龍則効勞華東、以誠景星充中鋒、全隊合作甚佳、擲籃以周學賢及誠景星爲最準、數次甚巧妙可觀、上半時以三十二比十五勝華東、不甚費力、</p>
<p>華東少擲籃人才　華東多係老將、但皆爲後衛人才、對於擲籃方面、較少把握、故下半時仍爲梵王渡之世界、結果五十七比三十四、梵王渡全隊實力、加以一番合作練習、將來不可小視、惟上海籃球會、出馬卽逢西靑、不無掃興也、</p>

<p>營養敎學丨吾國學校大半忽略、營養問題</p>
<p>多數面黃肌瘦、决不是偶然的、外國學校的膳食非常注意營養質量、將膳　當作營養敎室、敎兒童怎樣吃、吃什麽、見到食量减少的兒童、就要去問個明白、以資改善成醫治、</p>
<h3 id="c185">中學衛生敎育法 <a href="#c185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>中學生較小學生難管訓、但有的地方却也容易敎導、中學校衛生敎育、不必在枝枝節節上下手、只要提綱挈領的着眼於行政、行政良善、衛生狀態自能隨之良善、行政　敗、衛生狀態也會變得江河日下、由此、可知中校行政實緊衛生敎育的重要關鍵、豈可「等閒視之」、</p>
<p>中學衛生敎育的範圍、約分三點、第一爲課内的、第二爲與各科聯絡、第三爲課外的、茲分别討論於後、</p>
<h3 id="c186">敎室内的敎學法 <a href="#c186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>依靠着敎科書、敎師敎書、學生讀書、那一個不會、然而蹈着敎死書、死敎書、敎書死、讀死書、</p>
<p>死讀書、讀書死的覆轍、何補於事、要知衛生敎學除書本外、重在訓練、可是訓練說何容易呢、中學生程度不齊、課程又屬創見、而初中一年級卽須開始、問題遂接踵而至、最基本的難題、很明白的便是良好敎材的來源、這裏惟有醫學界敎育界打成一片、互相合作、才望能解决、</p>
<p>以往的敎材、先敎學生學習、强記什麽骨骼系筋肉系等等、徒令他們心事重重、無益實際日此後當注意敎材與學生生活發生關係、人身有多少根骨骼、學生知道了有什麽利益、這因與生活上漠不相關、該從速的改革、性的問題、淸潔的重要、預防的方法、醫治的技能、倒是急不容緩、非先行議解實習不爲功的、</p>
<h3 id="c187">各科聯絡敎學法 <a href="#c187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>上衛生課孜孜研求衛生學、上其他功課、便把衛生事項「棄之如進」衛生敎育仍不免於失敗、衛生是關係整個生活、以敎育卽生活之義、那末各學科、包含衛生的成分、不難明瞭、各科聯絡敎學法、限於時間、不能詳爲討論、姑舉數學科約言一二例、譬若計算微菌的生長率的比較、統計其種疾病的死亡、求得某種藥品的公式等、至若生物學化學物理學各科、更有機會敎學衛生了、</p>
<h3 id="c188">敎室外的敎學法 <a href="#c188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>課外的敎學法着重於行政事項、環境的設備、當稱最要問題、有人一提到「設備」立刻聯念到「經濟困難」、於是不能解决的事、都被這四個字一筆解决、要知環境設備不一定要錢、厠所淸潔、除自來水馬桶外、祇求勤護洗滌也、很合乎衛生了、反之假使學校負責人忘於督促淸理、卽使有了優良設備、骯髒萬分、錢花了不少、也是徒然、蚊蠅到處塵集、蛛蜘網無人打掃、我倒要問道不是經濟困難、總之、環境設備不必加上「洋」字、費了很多錢、才算體面、能夠合理化、卽是上乘、其次談到醫藥設施、上海有衛生局、局内特設學校衛生科、學校衛生敎育進展上、獲得帮助不少、然而敎師該利用醫藥設施啊、急救的技能、通空的學識、敎學時間表的編排、在在都要特别留神、</p>
<p>高中的衛生敎育、格外緊要、因他們離校日近、不久的將來、就要做人家的父母、入社會、衛生問題不特影響個已、還要影響他人呢、</p>
<p>中學生每喜吹毛求疵地找學校短處、而學校短處所在不外衛生欠缺、他們遂借題發揮、學校信仰全失、係這樣的學校、不由你陷於混亂狀態、是則學校衛生、怎可還不講求、（完）</p>

<p>— 瞻廬</p>
<p>丨世界異俗歌謠之二</p>
<p>喔喔啼！喔喔啼！南洋島婦戒殺雞！殺雞乃屬丈夫拿，何可責之</p>
<p>女與妻？男性執刀理應爾，婦女割鮮非所宜；習俗傳豈一朝？海外奇、　奇更奇！不是阿儂手無縛雞力，不是阿儂割雞不出血；只爲其中忌諱多，男子獨擅殺雞訣·男子手執殺雞刀，雞之滋滋味勝太牢；其肉當然逾熊掌，其湯宛比飲　　，享客可以資大嚼，佐羹可以飽老婆·倘使操刀由女子，雞便不美與不旨；其肉無味同嚼　，其湯淡如湯罐水；試嘗一嚮盡　眉，如此　湯大可恥·乍聞此語殊可笑，迷信之　　七疑；旣而一一細推推敲，此俗相傳亦大纱，從來女子軟心多，宰殺生靈非所好；非所好，用意巧；慫恿男人行殘暴·謬稱男子割鮮有長技，男子聞之欣然咸色喜；自許手腕勝女人，不知被伊戴上炭簍子！「註」若要殺雞俺這喪，應刀霍而往矣·吁嗟乎！手不操刀是婦德，殺雞專屬男子職；男人雞女人嘗，其味之美眞無匹！</p>
<p>「註」戴上炭簍子，便是戴上高帽子，借引我國俗語，</p>
<h3 id="c191">餘威猶在的梁財神 <a href="#c191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>— 庸子</p>
<p>丨麻醉了南京人丨</p>
<p>我這一次因公晋京，一口氣把公事辦就，實行了公爾忘私。先公後私，旣把公事辦就，於是因公濟私，（並非挪用公欵，）暢游了一番秦淮，玄武，夫子廟。</p>
<p>山東空心大富翁梁員外，在我的腦袋裏，本已沒些兒痕跡了，可是說也奇怪，我從南京回來時，却裝了一腦袋的梁財神。</p>
<p>事情是這樣的。我第一晚到南京，住在下關小旅館裏，忽聽得隔房裏一位江西老表有客拜訪。二人唇槍舌劍的雄辯了一番，臨了，那位來賓悻悻的道：「嘴說行價響，欠了錢不還，你倒是山東梁財神。」說罷，把門砰的一聲響，去了。</p>
<p>第二天，便急了想登坑解放，跨進厠所一看，裏面滿坑滿谷的生意興隆。我想厠所裏是妙文展覧所，我倒大可趁此機會，觀光一下首善的厠壁。妙，在「出賣重傷風」，「××到此一游」等標語之間，發現了「梁財神在此，百無禁忌」的口號。梁財神居然奪取了姜太公的地位。</p>
<p>晚上上澡堂洗澡，擦背的一壁替我擦背，一壁說：「梁財神從前也曾到這兒來洗過澡，而且也是我替他擦背的。」他的意思似乎梁財神一到，連澡堂都成了名勝，替梁財神擦過背，就算是有地位的人了。但是據說梁財神是終年不洗澡的。擦背的是否撒謊，我就無法證明。　　據我的朋友說：「我是梁財神」這句話，驅丐有奇騐。南京人儘有不知日本已在東北，組織傀儡政府那回事，但是說起梁財神，便沒一個不知道梁財神的時辰八字的。所以將來倘使有一位大文豪，提志筆來寫一部金陵外史，梁財神是不會沒有地位的。</p>
<h3 id="c192">賞雪 <a href="#c192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>— 施冰</p>
<p>丨雪沒有賞心已夠冷了丨</p>
<p>前天下了一整天的雪，在家裏坐着，因爲沒有裝置炎爐，覺得更加寒冷，還是到外邊去跑的好，于是穿上了兩鞋，到馬路上去賞雪，這也是賞雪的特别方法吧！</p>
<p>走出衖堂，就見到了三個穿西裝的人，頭縮在大衣裏，大談其跳舞。一位身子比較長的，尤有妙論。他說：「這樣光滑堅潔的雪地，眞是很好而天然的跳舞地板。」</p>
<p>到了電車站，逢着七八個剛散課出來的女學生，穿了毛皮大衣還在呌冷，但是伊們却在約着明天到兆豐公園去做大雪人。一個女生偏是掃興的的說：「明天恐怕不見得再會下雪，或者會溶化了，那不是很糟嗎？」</p>
<p>我想最好請這位愛跳舞的朋友，倘使他們有膽量的話，到山海關一帶去更好，非但他們可以常常在天然的光滑地板上跳舞，並且可以不費分文的滑冰呢。</p>
<p>至於這幾位要堆大雪人的女學生，我想請伊們到關外去觀光。那裏的雪是旣高且厚，永久不會溶化的。而且那裏的義勇軍身上是滿堆着雪，不是一個又大又活的雪人嗎？</p>
<p>雪沒有賞，心已夠冷了。</p>

<p>— 了紅瘦鵑</p>
<p>小曼說這種話時，那里像個成年的少婦，簡直等於一個俏皮的女孩。有時伊高興。還要添上幾句說：「小寳貝，乖些！聽我的話，只顧把身體養得胖胖的；白白的，逢到節氣，不要再發老毛病。這就是你們酬報我們了。·········」凡此種種，雖是一派玩笑之辭，很足以染紅他的臉。然而細味起來，語語親切；句各懇摯，自然而然的使他增進對於他們的感激。感激到了極處，反使他發生强度的悲感。所悲的，自已爲什麽沒有這樣一個良好的家？有時竟會使他生出一種奇妙的幻想。所想的，自已的身子，爲什魔不能搖幾搖，縮小若干，然後投身到他們慈愛的懷中去。</p>
<p>時光趁人們擾攘之際，悄悄地溜了過去，眨眨眼，春又翩然降臨於大地。世界萬物，最美麗的，無過於春之郊野，一草一木，都休沐於春光之中，換去了昨日的蕭索，而放出欣欣向榮之色。空氣裏面，似雜醉人的溫馨。四周的一切，百色畢具，恐怕最擅長調色美的畫家，筆底下，也沒有這樣完備的色澤。頭上藍蔚而澄淸的是天；潔白如新絮的是雲：碎金和翡翠間雜着舖滿了田畦的；是菜花與小草。婆娑的垂柳，綠得如烟似霧。幾樹桃花，臨風嬝娜，露出妙齡女郎羞靨般的嫣紅。神經質的人們，到了這種境地，安得不沉醉？不用說人，就是小鳥，也不肯放這春光輕過，它們也會呼伴結侶，在它們新加修飾的枝頭上，飛着：舞着；且歌唱着不用費腦力編製的浪漫小曲。不善歌唱的蝴蝶，趁此芳時，也就自由自在，穿起大自然所賜予的輕俏新衣，忙着遍訪它們的戀人，丨路旁孤芳自賞的野花。大槪這正是上帝吃醉了美酒，一時興奮而又忽動唯美的思想，因而才用他最偉大的藝術技巧，點綴下這許多賞心聲色，一面自娛，一面取悅於人類。</p>
<p>他深切地記憶，在這時候，無形的春之請柬，常把他和東方生夫婦倆，邀到這一條幽靜明媚的路上來。有時候，三人一同出外；有時候，小曼因料理家務，不能分身，他便和東方生相偕；也有時或遇東方生沒有出遊的興味，就由稚氣十足的小曼，和他作伴，一對兒像小孩似的，跳躍到這裏來。</p>

<p>（二）黑眼晴</p>
<p>十年前，讀法國文學者都德的「小物件」，那部小說中大黑眼睛的女主人翁，到如今，伊還是留在我的記憶裏。</p>
<p>罢眼睛，是天賦東方少女一種特殊的寳貝，享受愼碧綠蔚藍秋波的黃髮兒郎！他們對於黑眼睛，永遠是抱着渺茫的憧憬，和神秘的觀念。</p>
<p>在霞飛路亞爾培王路附近，一條狹巷裏，有一家神秘的半夜舞塲。舞塲是一間茅屋式的廣廳，四壁畫着鮮艷顏色的圖案：大紅，大綠，深黃，深藍，線條很粗，表現出原始民族藝術的風昧。壁上掛滿尖角形的五彩氈毯，比波斯天津特產更富麗更刺戟的氈毯，使滿屋增加一層和暖魅誘的　圍氣。</p>
<p>入塲處，是一條畫着古怪人物壁　的甬道，一個穿皇室制服，胸佩勳章寳星的白俄老人，在那裏管理衣帽。</p>
<p>走進廣廳的舞場，好像置身亞拉伯的王宮，土耳其的音樂，和亞美利加紅種土人的爵士，震蕩女人的心兒，激動男人的慾𦦨。還有那按�</p>
<p>着五色大圍巾蒙着大紅包頭綢布的吉百色女舞伴，伊們睜開着一雙雙黑眼睛，垂着疲倦濃長的睫毛，那一雙雙大而圓的黑眼睛，向你逼視，向你挑逗；若便你是個瞻小的男人，受不住那樣魅誘挑逗？你準會感到侷促，甚至於臉會得漲得通紅。</p>
<p>仰起頭來，在音樂台的後壁上，睜着一對黑眼睛，舞得瘋狂一般的各國各式男女，他們都不敢直視這一對有力神秘的眼睛，在他和伊的眼裏，看出對手火光般的綠眼睛和藍眼睛。</p>
<p>天空永是一片蔚藍，大幅的藍色陰丹士林布匹，掩住了簡陋的屋頂。在那裏，看不見白色的墻壁，也沒有半塊灰色的瓦磚。</p>
<p>敲過了十二點鐘，在昨夜和今晨移交的時刻，舞塲開始活躍生動起來。從最後一塲影戲院出來的人物，或者從别家舞塲跳完了最末一次舞的人物，都像潮浪般湧流到這裏來。</p>
<p>一個霞飛路的夜行者，他是這家半夜舞塲的常主顧。他稱贊伊的優點：在那裏，沒有階級，沒有紳士氣，沒有國籍，沒有種别。黑先生可擁着白太太舞，侍者在侍候你的餘㗇也可以坐下來同你對抽一支烟，或同你談談家常，講講娛樂。你不必顧忌。你熱，儘可脫下你的上衣，甚至把襯衫的袖口也可向上翻着。舞的地板，卽使你有些醉意，你舞時也不致有滑倒之虞。可是，這裏有熱，有魅力，有壁上的黑眼睛的逼視，有廳中的黑眼睛的挑逗。</p>
<p>這一家霞飛路上獨一的神秘半夜舞塲，它的名字，便呌做「黑眼睛。」</p>
<p>凡是思念着「小物件」中女主人翁的人們，你們不妨到這家舞塲裏去過一回通宵達旦的生活，你們可以找到黑眼睛中的黑眼睛。</p>

<p>昨據外電、倫敦大條近遠俱長零六二五、英美美英兩匯兌均見微升、美銀亦漲起一二五、遠期銀市銀行私電雖升而不多、人心極好、雖開平盤、爲七百九十七兩三錢、但此價絕出意外、故開後卽漲而至八百零一兩七錢、大致八百兩内、缺乏賣户、及至穿出八百兩大關、乃有成交、此時銀行開盤、亦較前收爲佳、内盤雖不能稱緊、亦殊穩健、故金價能在八百兩外站住、匯豐掛牌又縮、是以金市得一上升之機、前市始終在零一兩内外徘徊、中央銀行曾一度開現一百零五條、此時已近收市、塲内由潤昌裕進條、（代潤昌永）後市因銀行胃口績佳、孟買報跌、而見八百零四兩、最後仍入和平狀態、全市絕無風波、結果爲八百零二兩九錢收盤、一日間交易殊少鉅數、人心十分穩健、掉期貼價越大、曾爲二兩八錢、蓋現貨來源减少、空頭遂起恐慌、種種傳聞、亦因之而生、今將一日間上落、分紀於左、</p>

<p>晟開雖爲七百九十七兩三錢、但此價極不易得、故開後卽跳、大德成及物品套頭爭先求條、然八百兩關内絕少成交、祇能望洋興嘆、（物品開盤七百九十九兩半）福興永志豐永來進、遂穿出八百兩大關、而計零一兩七錢、大德成乃上塲脫售、價遂略低、匯市本月份英匯一先令八便士可結、美金九三七五亦有賣户、乃爲八百兩、福餘進條、升爲零七錢、而在八百兩外徘徊、物品套出條子、遂破八百兩、而爲九十九兩半、此時已預悉匯豐掛牌、英美俱縮一二五、志豐永來進、好上兩許、而爲零七錢、及至掛牌揭曉果低、乃見一兩三錢、但益豐在一兩限價售條、兆豐昌限價亦賣、乃退至一兩内、及至兆豐昌照市脫售、跌爲八百兩、三井連扒四月份美金二十八元一二五、凡二次、恒餘大興永爭購、漲至零一兩七錢、此時盤旋殊久、交易亦淡、及至十一時之後、安達售出正月份二十八元、乃盤旋而降、而至零一錢、瑞興稍納、加上數錢、潤昌裕代中央開現、但數不多、計一百零五條、雖加至零一兩一錢、仍見低下、永豐稍納、又自零一錢加爲零七錢、最後略見盤旋、而收盤爲八百兩零零五錢、物品拍同價、</p>
<h3 id="c199">後市一現八百零四兩 <a href="#c199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>午後開盤略增一錢、爲八百兩零零六錢、生大恒餘稍購、爲零一兩、福餘恒昌永進至一兩八錢、物品則出、爲一兩四錢、各豐吃二月份美金二十八元、志豐永來納、卽漲爲二兩外、福餘又進、（聞係代成豐永）志豐永亦來續購、遂升至零三兩、散户脫手、而塲内極度淸淡、盤旋而下、達一兩九錢、此後在二兩外徘徊、而無進退者頗久、及至孟買電吿小去三安那、再升至二兩七八錢、物品仍來售條、而瑞康忽於此際補空、但來勢極緩、故價雖暫見立住、亦無上漲之勢、盤旋亦多、花旗亦扒正月份美金九三七五、恒興雖進小數、市價仍被抬上爲三兩外、天豐永亦來猛購、乃達零四兩、此後已近收市、散户物品互相進退之勢、略見回低、最後以八百零二兩九錢收盤、物品略低、拍八百零二兩五錢、查一日間波平浪靜、最高價爲八百四兩、最低七百九十七兩三錢、雖有六兩七錢、但實際開盤太低、八百兩之内絕少進出、結果則較前收漲起五兩六錢、</p>

<p>揭價因匯豐掛牌美金低下一二五、爲二十七元六二五、故合金價亦改爲八百六十八兩七錢八分、計撳六十五兩八錢八分、（照收盤價言）如以開盤價言、（最低）則須撳至七十一兩外、結果則較之前收少撳一兩六錢八分、正月份與二月份登賬價同爲八百零三兩、三月份登賬價八百零一兩、補水上午八百零三兩、下午八百零五兩、</p>

<p>昨市烚赤漲風轉盛先在十兩外互相求貨、盈豐恒卽來抬價而購、計照加十二兩、較前日跳上有二兩强、賣户有束手之勢、盈豐恒在十兩價時售予大豐恒七十兩、但此價不易得、入後雖加至十二兩、成交亦少、蓋聞本日原有現貨八百兩抵滬、途中忽生事變、是以賣户缺乏、而求者（盈豐恒）益亟、</p>

<p>南市薄稻與陰元銷呆跌二三角</p>
<p>（滬北）昨日河下到貨十餘號、白粳高貨交易平常、中次尙稱不惡、市形高料定立、中次緊起尺外、薄稻到有銷滯、價疲尺外、早稻到少銷活、價帶緊象、羊杜尖來源不旺、去路尙佳、價緊角外、埠尖乏到、陰白元來貨不多、零銷頗佳、價加一二角、</p>
<p>（滬南）昨日來源三四十號、市况以　暦年關日近、零胃阻塞、包胃客家停辦、故常帮蘇帮同南港　角厚薄稻等米、俱　落二三角不等、陰元到多銷滯、亦跌三角之譜、杜洋尖無市、</p>

<p>洋米存底雖足、但市上浮存、早經售完、目下所存者多數爲洋商所有、少數則爲囤户積存、均以成本高昂、不願售出、但安南產價已見步落、昨洋商又在兜攬新交易、西貢一號祇有四兩二三錢、小絞只有三兩七八錢、西貢合申不到九元、小絞祇在八元以内、合申地市價約有七八角之利益、但定貨均掛遠期、米商雖　購定、然尙以前車之鑑、不敢貿然成交云、</p>

<p>新因現貧軋缺、對於一二月份、稍有抵進、市氣遂見穩固、迨至下午開盤、各月份交易、仍未見暢、惟廠家仍抵一二月份、遠期各月份、客帮亦略有交易、所以開價步俏、照目下之情形、雖洋麥屢有交成、不過現貨仍缺、人心仍難過落耳、（阜豐仍加八分、信太加六分）結果本月份較前日漲一分、二月份漲二分、三月份漲一分二厘半、四月份漲一分半、五月份漲一分二厘半、六月份漲一分七厘半云、</p>

<p>昨日糖市以標金轉堅、初盤頗有好意、但終以進户寥寥、未能加漲、公會劃盤、二四粗砂白出户呌十五兩八錢、因少受手、後仍以十五兩七錢半成交一百包、二十號中砂白略小、劃十五兩三錢二分半、建帮號家續開刁靑一百包、價九兩五錢、潮靑昨太古之綏陽號輪由汕入口、到有一千餘包、據函訊、高倎成本在九兩外、於結束期前、不肯再鬆云、</p>

<p>津靑客商紛紛北旋</p>
<p>五金交易、因廢歷年關伊　、客帮廠家均結束賬目、故交易十分鮮少、而率路若天津靑島諸帮或因封港、或因當地謠言盛熾、紛紛收束北歸者甚多、因此市上點綴亦覺寂寞、貨價緣進出兩㣲、殊鮮上落、惟海外定價連日報漲、所以市氣鞏固、致價看好者較多、其如馬口鐵·平白鐵·白鉛皮·瓦楞鐵等、莫不有雄糾糾之氣象、</p>

<p>— 杏鵑</p>
<p>好一回，　選了些嫁具走，咱說，這準不是好人！</p>
<p>過了幾天，那小子又來了，咱不理他，師父却巴巴的去招待。</p>
<p>先是他搭訕着和師父沒長沒短的　話兒，接着就見他嘴凑到師父的下朶邊，鬼心眼兒的不知咬上些什麽話！</p>
<p>但師父的笑臉却立刻沉了下來，連連的搖搖頭。</p>
<p>那小子似乎滿不高興的走了。</p>
<p>第二天朝，太陽上山，師父又肩着一串剷兒，鑿兒，···上街呌賣去。</p>
<p>太陽照進他店堂，咱和師妹滾銅子玩；師父不回；</p>
<p>太陽照正街心，咱和阿珍吃了飯，師父不回；</p>
<p>太陽照過對街家，咱和阿珍坐到門前等，師父不回。</p>
<p>太陽落山，高墩上的餛飩阿七跑進來，喘着氣，大把大把的汗！他說咱師父盜取了春太爺家的一雙金鐲兒，給抓進官裏去！師父說要大毛管店，要阿珍趕快去，不然，就給殺哩！</p>
<p>阿珍哇的一聲哭，跟着阿七飛也似的跑，咱沒豆　兒似的一時抓不定一個主見，心兒　直像紅鐵　；······</p>
<p>第一夜，月兒掛天空，咱在月光下兜圈子！一個人；</p>
<p>第二夜，月兒掛天空，咱在月光下兜圈子！一個人；</p>
<p>第三夜，師父回來了，咱問；師妹呢！師父不理咱，眼光憤怒的注視着空間，月兒掛天空，他在月光下兜圈子，師父在月光下倘眼淚，兩個人。</p>
<p>從此師父不再上街去呌賣了，他任咱們店裏的生意一天一天淸淡下去，他把店裏每天所買得的一點錢，全買了白干兒，給自家兒喝個爛醉，然後用大鎚子找到咱打；全不想到咱幾天來　着肚子，沒吃上好好的一餐飯呢！咱想走，又牽念到師妹，咱天天夢到師妹回來，但醒來後又是空！咱心兒裏，肉體上，混身兒全是痛苦！</p>
<p>咱想，師妹總該會回來罷，呵，那咱眞够樂！但一天又一天，一月又一月，咱總不見她回來。</p>
<p>有幾餐咱做夢，夢見她在春大爺那老賊的家，打扮得花娘似的；又夢見她被一隻狼正在生呑活剝，怪可憐！咱不敢想，想起了眼涙便和雨一般的直落。</p>
<p>師妹總該會回來罷；</p>
<p>這日子，眞難煞！（完）</p>
<h3 id="c255">釋和平 <a href="#c255" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e255" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">255</a></h3>
<p>— 顯舉</p>
<p>記得歐洲大戰終了的時候，北京開慶祝大會，蔡孑民先生演說，大意是說，公理戰勝了强權，從此世界可以走上和平之途。十餘年來國内外的史實，證明了蔡先生當時所做的『和平』之夢，終於只是鏡花水月的『幻夢』。</p>
<p>然而現在我國朝野上下，却還正做着這種和平幻夢。究竟和平的内容是怎樣的呢？因爲各個社會層的利害關係不同，也就各有不同的解釋。大略言之，約有三端：</p>
<p>一、强者的和平。老虎對羊說；我是極愛和平的，只要你們不反抗，我的食量也有限，每天吃飽了，自然會住嘴。你們的殘餘的生命，也會得到相當的和平。帝國主義者之於弱小民族，軍閥之於被壓迫人羣所要求的是這樣的和平。</p>
<p>二、弱者的和平。弱者的心理是一種偷生畏死的心理，他對於侵略者，壓迫者的侮辱與宰割，不敢作絲毫的抵抗，然而又不願赤裸裸地支畫投降的『十』字，於是也就眼着强者大喊和平。這個和平，就是拜倒在敵人的槍尖之下的『庶臉羞』，是無恥的和平。無恥的和平和强者無理的和平，都是人類眞正和平的大敵，我們應當用全力擊碎他。</p>
<p>三、眞正的和平，他是建築在全人羣的平等與自由的基礎上，而不是建築在强凌弱，富壓貧的基礎上面的。在這和平的王國内，不但政治上是平等自由的，即在經濟上也是平等自由的。大家的問題不是由一方面少數有力者的所謂法律和武力來强制，而是由社會的勞動組織的公約來調整。由現實制度過渡到眞正和平王國的過渡期間，自然還有一種以大多數人的强制的法律和武力來代替少數人强制的法律和武力的必要。但這是走上眞和平之路的必要手段，自然不能說是破壞和平。</p>

<p>言論自由，在中國還談不到。據中國民權保障同盟的宣言丨丨中國民衆以革命的大犧牲所要求之民權，至今尙未實現，實爲最可痛心之事。抑制輿論與非法逮捕殺戮之紀載，幾爲報章所習見；甚至靑年男女有時加以政治犯之嫌疑，遂不免秘密軍法審判之處分丨這樣看來則歐洲中世在黑暗時代所給與百姓的人身享有權（ＨabeasＣarpus）在中國還依然仍舊沒有獲得。三四千年前周厲王秦始皇當國的時候是如此，三四千年後革命成功的現在也還是如此。試問一個人對於自已的身體，都還不能保有，安全，那還有什麽言論不言論呢？沒有言論的人，是可以存在的，但世上是否可以有一種沒有身體的人呢？</p>
<p>英國小說家康泊東，麥干齊，最近因爲寫了一篇回憶錄，漏洩了大戰中當他在希臘英國情報商服務時候的秘密，被罚了兩千元。這事情幸虧是發生在自由主義搖籃地的英國，所以Ｃ·Ｍ的首領保住了，假使是在中國的話，大家試想想，結果將變成怎麽的一個樣子？蕭伯納倚老賣老，說英國可以放棄印度，結果也只受了一次殖民地總督的警吿，試想想這事情若發生在中國，則又將閙成怎樣的結局。</p>
<p>所以我感在目下的中國，要主張爭取言論自由，還是主張者的一種奢侈。</p>

<h3 id="c257">關於故鄕過年的種種 <a href="#c257" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e257" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">257</a></h3>
<p>— 大聖</p>
<p>幾天來下着鵝毛雪，很有些臘殘冬盡的景象。照日子推算，今天應該是臘月二十三了。雖說幾年來足跡如萍梗，所謂「良辰令節」已不能再在流浪者的心鑿裏激起「詩人般的感想」，但偶然想到故鄕新年前後的一些習俗和小兒女們的一些游戲，却也每每爲之悠然神往。「爲問故鄕的沙土與塵泥，是否巴掩沒了我靑春踐踏的足跡？」念此輒爲憮然！</p>
<p>×　　×　　×　　×　　×</p>
<p>我的故鄕是在湖南洞庭湖之濱。在我的故鄕，過了今天，明天（二十四日）就呌做「小年」。小年的晚上，俗傳竈神上天，報吿這一家大小的善惡，所以是晚家家必須祀竈神，而且用黃裱紙寫好疏文焚燒在竈頭，請他在上奏天庭時給這一家子說幾句好話。不過竈神是否接受這甘言和賄賂，却無從得知，大槪這年頭竈神也學乖了些罷。</p>
<p>過了小年，年關便眞的越逼越近了。母親便得吿誡孩子們，呌他們不要哭，不要多說話，對於「死」，「鬼」，以及「背時」，「倒霉」，等等不吉利的名詞，尤其絕對禁止。小孩是整天伸着頭望，望新年快來，「大人望挿田，小孩望過年」，這話是活畫出了成年人和小孩兩種不同的心理，同時也描寫出了成年人的悲哀。</p>
<p>到了十二月的最後一日，那就呌做除夕。除夕晚上一家子都要「守歲」，神靈前的香燭是通宵不斷。晨雞呌了，東方已經快要破曉，這時候，情勢是越來越緊張，大家都故意做出喜顏，不大說話，燃燒火把，準備砲仗，一家子都預備出行，出行的儀式是開開門，先由一家之主向蒼茫無垠的天地拜幾拜，再便將先預備好的砲仗劈劈拍拍地放，砲仗越放得久，越是以顯示這一家之闊綽，放完砲仗之後，便歡天喜地的回家，有的還抱回一大堆木柴，這是取「抱財回家」之意。</p>
<p>一進門，大家便忙着「拜年」，自然先是由小輩給長輩拜起，叩頭，作揖。假使這一家子的人口很多，那俣你一揖來，我一揖去，口裏還要說「恭喜，恭喜」，亂成一片。這眞是一幕極有趣的戲劇。一家子拜過後，再拜鄰居左右，次以及於遠處的親戚朋友，我在家裏的時候，便最怕這一套。</p>
<p>從正月初一到十五，大家是不做事的，有的玩玩紙牌，有的玩龍，玩燈，或玩獅子。玩龍，玩獅子，大槪大家都是知道的。至於玩燈，也是和上海大世界的雜格戲差不多。一個小生，一個花旦，唱的無非是一些男女調情的詞曲。也有許多很好的，可惜我都記不來。</p>
<p>十五晚上是呌做元宵，小兒女們便玩着「槓七姑娘」的把戲。七姑娘又呌做「　痢婆」，小兒女們奉爲神仙，說她能卜休咎。槓七姑娘的法子是用一隻竹箕纏上一隻竹筷和一朶花，再用一隻盤子裝些米，竹筷的一頭便挿在米上，由兩個未結婚的小姑娘各用一指抬起竹箕，口裏不住唸着符咒。七姑姑來的時候，竹箕上的筷子便在米上畫字，於是靜靜地站在旁邊的人便忙着問壽數，問年程之類。那符咒最有趣。　　「正月正，百草靑，請七姐，問年程。一問年程眞和假，二問年程假和眞，正月十五閙花燈，花燈閙得梭羅轉，梭羅樹上打鞦韆···」。</p>
<p>可惜我記不完全，只記得這麽多。</p>

<p>『他們到底和你是怎樣的親戚關係』？</p>
<p>聽見鶴子夫人說不理他們，他不禁又歡樂起來，他的態度也轉變了，很和氣地問她了。「不能吿訴你』。</p>
<p>她剛吃了一片麵包，很不好意思般地回答他。說了後，又臉紅紅地笑了。</p>
<p>她的這樣的態度又在他的心頭上引起了一陣疑雲。嫉妬之火比任何種火熖猛烈。的確他的臉色又轉靑了。</p>
<p>『那是你從前的老契』？</p>
<p>他故意說笑般地用廣東話問她。</p>
<p>『啊啦，林先生太看不起人了喲！假如是我的老契，我敢讓他到這裏來？他也不肯讓我儘坐在你的房裏了吧』？</p>
<p>她說了後，在哈哈地笑起來了。海泉覺得她的話也有道理，不禁臉紅了。</p>
<p>『今天天色好，林先生，到郊外去走走好麽？Ｐincinc』！</p>
<p>『下半天去吧』。</p>
<p>他無論如何不能否認他倆間的戀愛了。並且也覺得他在這時期中，萬不能離開她了。一離開她，便要嘗盡孤寂的苦悶。只要不觸及具體的問題，就和這個族類不同的女性保持着一種特殊的友情相處下去吧。他忽然又表示出他的妥協性來了。</p>
<p>『索性請一天假吧。這樣好的天氣。丨丨良辰美景，人生幾何？一天的功課算得什麽』？她在笑着說。他想，這明白是一種誘惑了。</p>
<p>『我有一封要緊的信，要送到學校裏去的』。</p>
<p>『貼兩分郵票寄了去，不好麽』？</p>
<p>『重要的信』。</p>
<p>這是卓淑華託他向任碩十那裏要來的薦書，薦她的哥哥到××局去工作的信。昨夜裏，在任家裏吃飯。因爲這件事，他覺得很不方便向任錦華啟齒。到後來才間接地由任夫人和她丈夫說了。海泉眞意料不到任碩士慨然地應允了他的要求，特别地替他寫了這封　書。他當時眞有說不出來的感激。因爲他執着這封信更可以向卓淑華誇耀了。</p>
<p>『重要的信掛號寄去好了』。</p>
<p>『那末寄快信好了』。</p>
<p>海泉答應了陪她一同出去，先到郵局寄快信，然後到公園裏去遊散。</p>
<p>『那眞是多謝林先生了！』</p>
<p>她這趟是用日本話，笑着向海泉鞠了一鞠躬。</p>

<h3 id="c259">論賣國 <a href="#c259" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e259" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">259</a></h3>
<p>— 吾</p>
<p>賣國一事，也許不見得如何冠冕堂皇，不過現在已到了「有國大家賣」的時候，所以到也有一論之價値。</p>
<p>本來，賣國，就不一定受若何重大的刑罰，何况是國已不國，自已又不能享受這國家的絲毫保障，所以倒不如一賣了事，大家樂得嘗嘗眞正亡國奴的滋味，也許這便是炎黃大好見孫的寛仁大德之最後目的。不過賣國也非易事，並不是每個老百姓都可以做到的，因爲滾滾諸公，已在零躉批發，我們小而又小的熱心賣國者，也就沒有揩揩油水的機會了。但是，這不免豈有此理；我們都是四千餘年的古國人民自有賣國的福分，那能由你們少數人行之了事，思之殊覺忿忿，所以我們必需爭取這賣國的權利。而且賣國的藝術亦大有研究之必要　　至於我們的賣國藝術，却也不攘，我們買賣劣貨，還說「愛國不敢後人」我們在「長期抵抗」的標榜之下，當然不必組織義勇軍，爲了學就做亡國奴的</p>
<p>才能，不妨多來幾套「跳舞救國」「遊藝救國」，「藝術救國」，「娛樂救國」，而使他人忘懷國難。我們的博士，學者名流們，爲了留着「亡國大夫」的地位，不妨極力贊成李頓報吿書。我們的士大夫們，爲了防止人民眞的擴大民族戰爭，妨害了他們的賣國生意，於是極力提倡「安内」。我們的藝術家，唯恐國之不亡，及老調重彈的高唱「爲藝術而藝術」。</p>
<p>這樣看來中國之應賣，早已不成問題，只是大家都在爭着爲賣國而努力，看誰能夠在其中得着天大的成功。只有在冰天雪地裏的東北義勇軍，他們才不會懂得賣國的好處，而一味的和帝國主義拚命，而且還希望熱心賣國的關内大慈善家有着物質上的援助，眞是優而又　了。</p>

<h3 id="c260">唱片的製法 <a href="#c260" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e260" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">260</a></h3>
<p>— 中勝</p>
<p>留聲機和唱片，誰也知道，是美國發明大王愛迪生所發明的。但愛迪生當初所發明的方法，却很不完全，後了經了好久的改良，才達到現在這樣完善之境！</p>
<p>起初，愛迪生所發明的唱片的製法，呌做『喇叭式灌音法』。其法，於金屬製喇叭的後端，置一『收音箱』（ＳoundＢox</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>）；這收音箱，貼有一片雲母薄膜。所以在喇叭外面所演奏的音樂聲樂等，便收集於嗽叭管内，直接使薄膜振動：薄膜即將其振動傳到一根鋼計，則鋼針便把音波刻在回轉着的蠟盤上面。</p>
<p>不過這種方法很不完全。第一，人類所發出的聲音的振動數，普通每秒間約自二十六周波至一千七百周波，而樂器所奏出的振動數則每秒約三十周波至七千周波，至於人們的耳朶所聽得到的聲音的振動數，每秒自三十周波至二萬周波爲止。可是這種喇叭式灌音法所能灌收的音波，每秒間祇三百周波至二千五百周波：無論振動膜用怎樣好的，也不過能灌收八十周波至四千周波的音波而已。第二，灌音的時候，因喇叭的反響等，而能使音質變化。第三，記錄音波的時候，因振動膜和蠟盤會發生抵抗，故所記錄的音波在某範圍内會變成較弱，甚至記錄爲與原音相差甚遠者。第四，因此，低音的樂器所發出的聲音，很不容易記錄，總之，依喇叭式灌音法製成的唱片，成績很不完美，不能算是原音的再生，祇是和了原音較近似的一種平面的『罐頭式的聲音』吧了。</p>
<p>後來，經了美國勝利（Ｖibtor）公司和西電（ＷesternＥlectric）公司共同研究，到了一九二四年，才完成了一種『電氣灌音法』。這種方法，是應用一種『眞空管增副裝置』的，大凡人類的聽覺所能感覺的一切音響，此法均能灌收。於是，喇叭式灌音法便成爲過去『科學界的遺跡』！</p>
<p>這種電氣灌音法，沒有用喇叭，而改用一種『微音器』（ＭicroＰhone）。音波的記錄，須經下列的順序：㈠微音器㈡擴大器（Ａmplifier）㈢電氣式記音機（ＥlectricＲocorder）蠟盤（ＷaxＰiate)。</p>
<p>最初，人的喉嚨所發出的肉聲，或樂器所發出的樂音，由微音器感受後，音波即變，成電波：但這電波非常纖細微弱，固不足以振動記音機，故須先傳至擴大器，使其『增副』爲數百萬倍的電波：這增副了的電波，作用於記音機，則還元爲本來的音波，而使寳石製灌音針振動，將細密的音波刻於回轉着的蠟盤上。這樣製成的蠟盤呌做『記音蠟盤』（ＰlateＲecordingＷaxＰlate）。</p>
<p>其次，塗抺一種混合塗料於記音蠟盤表面，使其變成一種電氣導體，並浸之銅電氣分解槽内，將其表面加以電氣鍍金，至所鍍的銅板厚約三十二分之一英寸爲止。後從槽内取出，把所鍍銅板與蠟盤分離，則蠟盤上的音波記錄便很正確地複寫於銅板上。這呌做『父型』（ＯriginolＭaster）。</p>
<p>父型製妥後，須另以父型爲模型製成一個『母型』。其法，先塗抺剝離溶液於父型上面，將其浸於鎳（Ｎickel）電解槽内約一小時，則其表面便鍍上一層鎳。再將其浸於銅電解溶液中，於鎳面的背後鍍上一層銅板。而後從電槽中取出，把兩鑄盤剝離，則鎳面的新鑄盤便是『母型』（Ｍother）。這個母型，可與普通的唱片一樣，在留聲機上再生出原音來。中國灌音公司的片子我雖沒有看見過，也許就是『母型』這一類的東西。</p>
<p>母型製妥後，塗上剝離溶液於其表面，鍍上一薄的鎳層：再放在銅電解深液内，鍍上銅層。而後取出，把兩面剝離，釘上一塊銅板於新鑄盤的後面，再將其剪成與普通唱片的型；這就呌做『原盤』（ＳtanＰer）。用這原盤印製出來的，就是我們所用的唱片：所以這原盤如有些細的痕跡，便須另由母型如上述方法製一新的原盤，否則所印製的唱片便不能完全。</p>
<p>普通唱片的原料，係印度，美洲，東印度等處所產的膠橡皮類（ＳhellacＫubber），（Ｃarbo　Ｂlack），及其他種種塡料類，這些原料，須先用特殊的挽碎機及混合機等粉碎加熱煉成一塊四角形的東西，這呌做（Ｂiscuit）（餅乾之意），每一塊恰恰適於印製一張唱片。將此原料，置在蒸汽加熱板上，使其變成柔軟，而後置於原盤甲與之乙間，加以壓榨及冷却，則便成普通的唱片。</p>
<p>但唱片在發賣以前，須先經精密的試聽，每一種片，須最初所印製的二十五片均完全沒有缺點，才能通過：否則便是原盤有缺點·故須另新從母型鑄一原盤。</p>

<p>我到課室，已經是最後一個了？剛剛放下屁股，蓄有八字鬍鬚，富有木屐兒派氣的Ｃ敎授好像來步我後塵似的，也站立講台上面了。</p>
<p>Ｃ敎授把身子打整了一回，就把一只惟一寳藏皮包子解開來，拿出了五十多張考卷紙，呌善武派領袖楊×分散。他就用訓詞式講演了幾句，離開講台，放出他汽車電燈似的眼睛，實行做巡閱使了。</p>

<p>「那能可以呢！院長已對我說過，這次考試要特别嚴緊一點。今天，你們不交卷，我不是要聽他的閒話嗎？」</p>
<p>「那末，我們交白卷可以嗎？」</p>
<p>「不過，歹好點終要寫幾句，使我可以交代過去就好了。」Ｃ敎授說後，就走到講台上來了。</p>

<h3 id="c265">怎樣來改革社會制度？ <a href="#c265" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e265" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">265</a></h3>
<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>自從拙著「怎樣爲老友復仇」登載後，即蒙先生予以同情，並指導：又蒙湼之君，熊君提出解决的方案老友潘君不幸的遭遇，竟能引起這許多同情，却非鄙人始料所及！</p>
<p>死者已矣！生者何堪！我們當更進一步爲一般活着的被剝削如潘君的人們設想，誠如湼之君所言：「已不限於人的問題，應該推廣到怎樣來改革社會制度了，」我覺得在整個社會沒有改革以前，一切個人問題，均無從着手，我們不能空　咒駡社會，更不該坐着等待别人來將社會改革好，然後讓我們去享福，社會上每一個份子，都負有改造社會的使命，</p>
<p>但是「怎樣改革社會」這個問題，决不是一人的智力所能解决，必須經大衆的討論研究，而後可有圓滿的結論，爲了篇幅的關係，我只能將我的見解剷出一個輪廓，以供讀者的研究討論，並請編者先生予以指導，</p>
<p>㈠鴉片戰爭後中國社會的變遷···丨在鴉片戰爭以前，中國是一個自足自給的封建社會。閉關自大，倒也稱得個小康。自鴉片戰後，資本主義的國家，在用大砲侵略之後，繼續着用像洪水一般的商品來侵略，摧毁了農村經濟一切舊的制度，無論在經濟上，政治上，思想上，階級關係上，都急劇地起了變化，並且因爲受帝國主義者侵略的影響，非特無以自拔，甚至論爲次殖民地的絕境。</p>
<p>㈡中國社會經濟的二大危機，（Ａ）都市的畸形發展，丨連年的兵匪水早，以及外來的農產品，都加速了農村的破產，驅使一般人向都市集中，形成都市畸形發展，（Ｂ）一切主要產業如鐵路·航業·銀行·鑛業·均操外人之手；而每年復有十萬萬元左右之入超；致經濟有破產之虞。</p>
<p>㈢政治上的危機丨帝國主義的列强，爲要解决自身的出路，不得不拚命攫取中國的權益，最近的東北事件，即其一例，　　㈣中國的出路丨欲求中國的出路，只有將上述經濟及政治上的危機，謀一補救，只有積極反帝，擺脫帝國主義的束縛，驅除帝國主義在華勢力，（一切經濟的，政治的勢力），然後中國可以統一，民族資本可以發展。反帝的第一步工作，在目前當然是抗日集合全民族的力量，實行抗日！總而言之：中國不脫帝國主義的束縛，社會制度即無從改革。</p>
<p>這是我們的切身問題，望讀者們熱烈地來參加討論，並請編者先生予以指導，敬請撰安，　　顧中傑敬上</p>
<p>一月十　　×　　×　　×　　×</p>
<p>編者按：顧君來信，對於中國社會不良之由來說得頭頭是道：並且提出的改良辦法，也不爲無見，但我們以爲這「改造社會」的問題，涵義甚廣，千頭萬緖；有非片言所能解决，先知先覺的總理，經四五十年的研究，手訂了三民主義；發明了這無所不容，無所不包的救國主義。</p>
<p>以言擺脫帝國主義者的束縛，則有民族主義在。</p>
<p>以言安定社會，消除人禍，則有民權主義在。</p>
<p>以言穩定經濟，發展資本，復興農村，則有民生主義在。偉大哉三民主義！有改良社會之責者，其深體而力行之！</p>

<p>— 高志翔譯Ｅ·Ｖ·Ｌycas著</p>
<p>「誘惑」，這題材是不能在相識和不相識的大衆面前，坦白地說出來的：但，從這很含混的談話中，我們也可以聽取不少的有趣味的幽默。</p>
<p>『我的最大的誘惑』一位美麗的女子說，「是在去冬發現的，那時我是住在立拂來海邊的一家，不很稱心的旅館中，我很奇怪，爲什麽在那裏消磨了很多的時日，原來我是爲了要離開那冰天雪地的地方而來的，你們領會這意思吧」？</p>
<p>每人都似乎明瞭這話。</p>
<p>『我在那裏住了幾天後的某一傍晚，住在那裏附近的鄕村的幾個朋友，約』</p>
<p>我晚餐，我很愉快地穿了我路過巴黎時買的幾套時髦的衣服，預料在那時必能得到不少的讚美，但，我要帶我的戒指的，一切愉快的幻想都成了泡影，我原有幾只特色的戒指，我就吩咐女僕丨丨她是新僱用的丨丨我要這些戒指。』</p>
<p>『她就取出了幾只放在桌上。』</p>
<p>「不對」，我說，「不是這些，我要的是翡翠和紅寳石的那幾只」。</p>
<p>「都拿來了」，她說</p>
<p>「都拿來了！」我喊呌着，「你怎麽說？難道那翡翠和紅寳石的都不在？還有鑽石的耳環？」</p>
<p>那有這些東西的影踪！</p>
<p>我昏迷了，我想，這似乎是人世中的命運吧，每個人早晚必會遭到一次失竊的，但我至今還不曾碰到過，</p>
<p>『還好，已經保險了，可是我很歡喜牠們，所以我很惱恨，</p>
<p>『我和女僕一而再，再而三地檢查那只手飾匣，尋遍了可能的地方，或事可能的地方，然後我就去報吿旅館的經理，</p>
<p>『他是很有體貎的，他詢問我，但他决不相信在他的地方會有這樣的竊案發生，他問我果眞帶來了嗎丨丨因爲女子常是善忘的，</p>
<p>『是，我確實帶來了，</p>
<p>『說你沒有懷疑嗎丨丨他斜視着女僕而說，</p>
<p>『我相信，那賊必是外人，</p>
<p>『但在我們旅館的章程上，顧客必須將財物明交帳房保管，但雖如此，我當盡力效勞，如果你能開給我一張詳細的失單，我就去報吿警察，』</p>
<p>『因此我就將失竊的戒指很詳細的開示了，然後很煩惱而失望地赴宴去了，</p>
<p>『翌日，我見很多位警察不斷地來到，那可憐的女僕，被審問了又審問，我感覺着在那裏每個僕人都厭惡我，因了我，使他們受着嫌疑，</p>
<p>『但審問後，並沒有結果，竊案的踪跡終久是查不出，我就急促地回到倫敦，報吿保險公司，一切都委托他們去辦，</p>
<p>『當很多訪問者來探問我時，我就說世界上，最可感激的，除了警察丨丨時常將我們遺失的傘送還給我們之外，保險公司的職員是最受人歡迎的，因爲，我已領到一張賠償戒指的支票，而事情也這樣的結束了，』</p>
<p>她的話中止了，</p>
<p>『但誘惑在那裏？』座中幾人問着，</p>
<p>『我要繼續講來，』她說，一支票是在下午寄來的，翌日我就去銀行存欵，還要看看那只存在銀行保管庫的保險匣子，　』</p>
<p>美麗的小姐的話又停了。</p>
<p>『怎麽樣？』許多人便問，</p>
<p>『好』，她說，「銀行的職員便將這保險匣子在會客室裏交給我，我打開一」</p>
<p>看，最先發見的，就是那遣失的戒指之一，其餘的也都在裏面。』</p>
<p>『啊！』座中一位喊着，</p>
<p>『是，那些東西都保存在匣中，當我沒有到立拂來之前，我就很小心地放好了，但，直到這時我才忽然記憶起來，人們常被記憶所愚弄，那眞是神秘極了，記憶時常使人失敗的，</p>
<p>『你們現在明瞭那「誘惑」了吧？』她說，「在我走回家去的路上，那「誘惑」縈繞在我面前，除了我，沒有人知道那戒指的眞相，即使保險公司，也永遠不會發現的，如果我是不誠實的，我可以有了戒指，還可以得一筆賠欵，』　　她又停止不講了，</p>
<p>「果眞這樣！」座中一位說，又靜默了許久，</p>
<p>在每次無論大小的叙會中，必然有這樣的笨伯，當大衆都明瞭了而默然時他還要不加思索的再很誠懇地發問，「你如何辦呢？」</p>

<h3 id="c268">藝術常識笑片中的可笑的動作 <a href="#c268" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e268" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">268</a></h3>
<p>— 池沼</p>
<p>一張稱得爲笑片的，在聲音時代除了那可笑的對話以外，就可笑的動作了，據我個人的觀察，在許多笑片裏面的要笑的動作可以槪括有下列的幾種：</p>
<p>㈠裝呆：呆子是可笑的，所以笑片裏的演員，常常故意裝出呆頭呆腦的舉動來博看者一粲，比方一個滑稽的角色在走去彈鋼琴，但鋼琴和坐椅距離太遠了，在常人祇要把那輕便的坐椅拉過去，但他却要用盡全身力氣去摧動那重大的鋼琴靠近坐椅，你想，這種動作，那有不引起自命爲聰明的看客的哄堂大笑的嗎？</p>
<p>㈡裝假：裝假也是引人發笑的一種材料，在笑片中裝假的動作，比方一個滑稽角色仗着他袋裏的手槍把一羣强盜嚇走了，但，當那羣强盜走後，他却從袋裏把手槍掏出來，他悠閒地，不經意地把他的手槍剝開皮，露出雪白的果肉向嘴裏大嚼，原來他的手槍是香蕉，那時觀衆們也總會莞爾而笑吧！</p>
<p>㈢相反：相反也可說是不相稱，一個高子和一矮子站在一起，你們會笑他不相稱，一個大胖子和一個瘦子碰大一起，你們也會笑，他不相稱，一個人暴跳如雷，另一個却慢條斯理，你們也總會覺行可笑，比方在「葛洛克」一片裏面，那葛洛克挽着大皮箱走向無台來，他却毫不驚異地，從那大皮箱裏取出那最小的梵亞鈴來，那感覺銳敏的觀衆們，想也免不了哈哈大笑吧，</p>
<p>㈣錯誤：一個人做事弄得大大的錯誤那眞是一種笑枘，你看到一個人吃香蕉不剝皮而連皮吃，你總會把那人傳爲笑談，比方在「老爺兵」一片裏面，那瘦子勞萊想把報上載的肥田粉的廣吿裁下來，他便把報紙放在一張皮面的椅上，一面把刀子將那廣吿割下來，廣吿是割下來了，但連椅子的皮面也給他割去像廣吿大小的一塊，觀衆們看見他這種錯誤的舉動，自然會棒腹大笑了，</p>
<p>以上的四種可笑的動作，不過是我個人的觀察到的，在笑片中除了這四種之外，當然還有許多，不過這四種是普遍可見的，而在四種，我每種祇不過舉一例以槪其他，遺漏是在所不免的，</p>

<p>— 易華</p>
<p>好萊塢現在是非常急切地在討論曼琳黛德麗的問題。因爲她和派拉蒙公司所訂的合同將於本月二月間期滿。她是否仍舊續訂？除了馮史都漢，而别人的導演？她是否接受？她和希佛萊的關係究竟如何？問題多得很，</p>
<p>已是許久，她沒有表示過任何的意見，最近她却竭誠地招待新聞記者！宣佈她今後的行蹤，</p>
<p>她說，她和馮史都漢的合同，在新近的一張影片吿成後，即已滿期。她非常堅决地說，也將不再逗留在好萊塢，而準備到巴黎柏林和倫敦各處去歌唱。</p>
<p>她說她的登臨銀幕，並不是爲了金錢，金錢對於她並不是一回事，她完全是受了馮史都漢的敦勸而加入派拉蒙的。所以也許仍接受了他的勸駕，而會留在好萊塢但她祇願受史都漢一人的導演。</p>
<p>她和希佛萊的種種謠傳，她說：「外邊的人或者忘記我是一個已婚的女子，我和丈夫從沒有考慮過離婚的事情，他依舊很快樂的度着聖誕節啊。」</p>
<p>曼琳在好萊塢已有三年半之久，共完成了五張影片，然而僅僅這五張，她已在好萊塢佔有了重要的地位。</p>
<p>總之，謎樣的黛德麗，正是嘉寳第二啊！</p>

<p>可是隔了幾個禮拜，保羅又買了火車票，要到法國的利佛拉去了，他想要打一個電報約慕爾娜一同去。他還沒有打完電報，愛立克跑進來了。保羅對他笑笑，心中似有說不出的快樂，『這一次可眞要走了。我亦不吿訴你到什麽地方去，免得像上次似的你到陸慈堡來找我回來。我要上天堂去休息三個禮拜。』</p>

<p>Sino-Japanese Dispute: League of Nations Acknowledges Mediation Failure</p>

<p>Drummond Denies Making New Proposals; Remarks Are Ambiguous.</p>
<p>Representatives of Smaller Nations Expressed Sympathy for Us and Launched a Joint Criticism.</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Just when the League of Nations was despairing of mediation, a so-called new compromise proposal suddenly emerged, catering solely to Japan. Our proposed amendments were not considered, nor were our representatives contacted. After Representative Yan made a serious protest, representatives of various smaller nations unanimously opposed it. The League of Nations, knowing that it could not exert undue pressure on us, has declared that the new compromise proposal was merely a private contact between Drummond and Sugimura and cannot be regarded as the consensus of the League of Nations. At the same time, Japan also stated that it could not agree. By the afternoon of the 17th, the situation suddenly changed, and the new compromise proposal had failed. It is reported that at the meeting on the 18th, a formal declaration of the failure of mediation will be made, and a report will be drafted based on Article 15, Section 4. Although the content is not fully known, according to diplomatic authorities speaking to reporters on the 17th, regardless of what method or conditions the League of Nations adopts to handle the Sino-Japanese dispute, we will resolutely reject anything that is detrimental to our country and will make a more serious expression at an appropriate time. (Central News Agency dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Japanese delegation observed the League of Nations situation and believed that once the government's instructions regarding the compromise proposal arrived, the deliberation of the Sino-Japanese problem would come to an end. They would then focus on the issue of establishing a small committee and begin preparatory negotiations for direct Sino-Japanese negotiations, and were extremely optimistic about the future. However, the situation suddenly changed, and it could not be determined if this was a reversal. There were two reasons for this. One was that the Chinese representative, Yan Huiqing, protested to Chairman Hymans about the compromise proposal drafted by Drummond. The other was that representatives of small countries such as Ireland also took the same attitude as China, expressing a firm stance, criticizing Drummond's unauthorized modification of the draft resolution. Drummond avoided his responsibility at today's committee meeting, saying that Sugimura had expressed a certain proposal to him, asking whether the committee could accept the proposal. He only offered the same opinion as he would to other member states. Foreign Minister Simon also appeased the representatives of the small countries, saying that the talks on the Sino-Japanese issue have now come to an end. If the middle section of the compromise fails, then the provisions of Article 15, Section 4 will be invoked. It seems that Foreign Minister Simon's plan to convene a general assembly to review the mediation procedures has failed, and he realizes that he has no choice but to adopt the provisions of the fourth item. The League of Nations' statement tonight said that if mediation fails, the Sino-Japanese issue will be handled in accordance with Article 15, Section 4, which is now attracting attention from all sides. (Japanese United Press dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Committee of Nineteen met this afternoon without any startling developments, but the consensus is that mediation has failed, and the second step is to prepare a report on this dispute under Article 15 of the Covenant. The meeting lasted only one hour and was devoted to hearing a report from League of Nations Secretary-General Drummond on his efforts to make contact after the last meeting. The committee will meet again on Wednesday, by which time the Japanese government's reply regarding the draft proposal should have arrived in Geneva, so Wednesday's meeting will be extremely important. Drummond explained to the committee the status of the letter from Chinese representative Dr. Yan protesting his proposal. Drummond denied that he had made any proposals and stated that League of Nations Deputy Secretary-General Sugimura had met with him and asked whether he thought certain proposals could be accepted by the committee, to which he replied that he would treat them as he would any other member of the League of Nations. The meeting then discussed whether to issue a denial to the press, but ultimately decided that a statement on the general situation should be issued after the meeting. At the same time, it was also decided to reply to Dr. Yan, explaining the actual situation, telling him that the committee had not issued any proposals to Japan, and stating that the committee did not want to wait indefinitely and would proceed to the second step in accordance with Article 10 of the Covenant. It is reported that this statement was suggested by British Foreign Secretary Simon. Irish representative Lester said that every time the committee adjourns, there is one or two incidents of war, and this adjournment is no different. Chairman Hymans told reporters after the adjournment that this would be the committee's last effort at mediation. Judging from the situation at today's meeting, the situation has clearly taken a turn for the worse, largely due to a letter from Chinese representative Dr. Yan protesting the so-called Drummond proposal, and the attitude of some small countries denying that anyone has the right to unilaterally amend the Committee of Nineteen's proposals. Drummond denied to the committee that he had taken any action, but the statement issued to the press was ambiguous on this point. In any case, the prospect of mediation is definitely hopeless. Hymans and Simon both felt today that it was necessary to tell those who inquired that what was expected at the time of the adjournment had failed, meaning that it was necessary to convene the League of Nations General Assembly as soon as possible. According to the record of the League of Nations General Assembly, which has repeatedly urged both parties to shake hands but ultimately failed, it seems too late at this time to wait for Tokyo's reply as a basis for any agreement. Therefore, the Committee of Nineteen can only report the failure of its mission to the League of Nations General Assembly, and the League of Nations General Assembly will begin drafting a report in accordance with Article 15, Section 4 of the Covenant. (The text of this section of the Covenant states: "If the dispute cannot be resolved in this way, the Council shall, with the agreement of all or a majority of its members, make and publish a report containing a statement of the facts of the dispute and the recommendations which the Council thinks just and proper in regard thereto.") The procedures initiated in accordance with this article do not necessarily imply that a break with Japan is inevitable. What happens next will depend on the form and nature of this report. According to the current situation, the report will likely be based on the proposals and explanatory memorandum of the Committee of Nineteen. In other words, this report will also be based on the recommendations of the Lytton Report. Therefore, Wednesday will be a very important day.</p>
<p>At 7:25 tonight, the committee issued a communiqué, signed by Hymans, stating that the committee had expressed the view on December 20 that its responsibilities had not been fully fulfilled until it had exhausted its mediation efforts and demonstrated evidence of extreme patience in attempting to resolve the matter. Today, the committee confirmed this view and expressed the opinion that if the procedures under Article 15, Section 3 of the Covenant unfortunately fail, it will have to terminate the mandate given by the resolution of March 11, 1932, as soon as possible and prepare a report in accordance with Article 15, Section 4 of the Covenant. It was found that at the meeting on December 20, the parties concerned had engaged in talks due to the mediation of Chairman Hymans and Secretary-General Drummond, and it was felt that these talks would take some time. Subsequently, no other new proposals were received except for new proposals from the Chinese government. During talks between the Japanese delegation and the Chairman and Secretary-General, it was stated that they were in contact with the Tokyo government regarding new proposals to be submitted to the Committee of Nineteen. Today, it was learned that the Japanese delegation could receive its government's opinions within 48 hours. The committee believed that it was necessary to realistically ascertain in a very short period of time whether the League of Nations General Assembly could fulfill the mandate given by Article 15, Section 3 of the Covenant, so it had no choice but to grant this short adjournment. (Reuters dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) General public opinion in the League of Nations believes that yesterday's resolution is equivalent to an ultimatum, meaning that both parties must accept the resolution of the Committee of Nineteen on December 20, or face the consequences. Roughly, the resolution is limited to passing the Lytton Report. The League of Nations will adopt the opinions of Article 16 of the Covenant, or it may have to drop the matter. What is noteworthy is that British Foreign Secretary Simon was the first to suggest that if Japan's reply is not satisfactory, the second step should be taken. However, it is believed that the reply will give people an opportunity for arrangement. With this arrangement, the non-participation of the United States and Russia in the Mediation Committee will not become an irrecoverable obstacle. However, if Japan still demands that the term "Manchukuo" not be mentioned, it will definitely destroy the possibility of understanding, because all countries insist on this point and will not give in.

<h3 id="e3">Foreign Minister Luo Issues Declaration <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Difficult to Accept If Resolutions Violate Our Claims</p>
<p>Expresses Dissent to the League of Nations for First Contacting the Japanese Side</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the recent measures taken by the League of Nations Committee of Nineteen on the Sino-Japanese issue, Foreign Minister Luo Wengan made the following statement on the 17th. At the end of last year, China had already expressed dissatisfaction with the draft resolution and explanatory memorandum drafted by the League of Nations Committee of Nineteen and proposed various amendments. However, when the League of Nations adjourned, Japan again occupied Shanhaiguan and Jiukou, actively preparing to attack Rehe, and threatening the Pingjin area. In view of Japan's active acts of aggression, the League of Nations should have recognized that there was no room for mediation in the Sino-Japanese issue and should have taken effective steps to sanction Japan's atrocities. However, recently, the League of Nations revised the draft resolution prepared last year, reducing its strength, and consulted Japan for agreement without contacting China at the same time, as if the Chinese government would surely accept the resolution if it was agreed upon by Japan. The Chinese delegation has warned the League of Nations that China still insists on its claims from last year and that it is difficult to accept resolutions that violate our claims, and expressed dissent to the League of Nations for first contacting the Japanese side. Now, we deeply believe that the League of Nations will not disregard its own position and cater to the will of the aggressor. However, if the League of Nations forces China to accept resolutions that it cannot agree to, the government will issue resolute instructions to our delegation. (Central News Agency dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Diplomatic circles have learned that the League of Nations Committee of Nineteen's new mediation plan avoids mentioning the non-recognition of "Manchukuo" and the invitation of the United States and Russia to participate in the Mediation Committee. It has not taken into account China's amendments to the original draft resolution, such as the declaration of Japan's responsibility for violating various conventions and the clear stipulation that the so-called "Manchukuo" should not exist. Although Secretary-General Drummond sought the consent of the chief representatives of China and Japan regarding the new mediation plan, the Committee of Nineteen focused on obtaining Japan's consent first, so that the Chinese attitude could be consulted after the Japanese side expressed complete acceptance of the mediation plan. Yan sent a telegram to the government to ask for instructions on how to deal with the League of Nations' desire for the establishment of a new mediation plan, and described the details very carefully. After Luo and the government authorities carefully studied the relationship between the advantages and disadvantages of accepting or rejecting the new mediation plan, they deeply felt that there were major responsibilities and impressions regarding the rejection or acceptance of the new mediation plan, and they were quite hesitant. The government authorities believed that the new mediation plan only lacked the promise to make Japan fulfill its promise not to invade occupied territory and not to station troops for a long time in non-railway areas. Especially because the current situation in North China is serious, and the armies of China and Japan are on the verge of a major war over the occupied lines in Rehe and the Beining Road, the government sent a telegram to Yan on the morning of the 16th, instructing him to solemnly declare to the Committee of Nineteen that China did not intend to completely reject the opinions agreed upon by the entire committee, but that it had requested the following: 1. Please do not ignore the original elements of the date and effect of the mediation; 2. Please confirm that all the facts of the Lytton Report are a legitimate basis; 3. The League of Nations should guarantee that neither party will resort to force or war from the date of the establishment of the mediation plan; 4. Our side still reserves all the points declared at the successive sessions of the League of Nations General Assembly. Now, because the Japanese government must instruct the Japanese delegation on the new mediation plan before the 18th to reply to the Committee of Nineteen, our side's final opinions are still awaiting a complete determination of the Japanese government's attitude before determining effective countermeasures.

<p>(Nanjing) According to those who are well-versed in the international situation, the smaller countries are still very sympathetic to us, and the method of consultation has not yet shown any unfavorable indications to us. However, Britain is making things difficult for us everywhere. Since Simon attended the League of Nations, he has never said a word to uphold justice. The new compromise plan, which is very unfavorable to us, is a collusion between the British Secretary-General of the League of Nations, Drummond, and Japan, and the one acting behind the scenes is Simon. Britain's difficulties with us are not only to ingratiate itself with Japan, but are actually retaliatory actions against the United States caused by war debts.

<p>(Geneva) There are rumors that the British government has changed its position in the Sino-Japanese dispute. British officials, when hearing this, said that the United Kingdom has always recognized that there are two issues that should not be handled together, namely, mediation and the report to the General Assembly. The British believe that there must be a failure of mediation before there can be a report to the League of Nations General Assembly. True friends of peace in the Far East do not want to hastily consider mediation to be impossible in the current final mediation efforts, so as not to hinder the opportunity for possible success. The Committee of Nineteen has decided that Japan must be given the opportunity to present an acceptable plan as the basis for mediation. If this plan is unacceptable, then the issue of the report will arise. The United Kingdom's views on this report are quite clear. Foreign Secretary Simon clearly stated on December 2 that the United Kingdom will act as a loyal member of the League of Nations, and stated that the League of Nations Covenant is an important foundation, and the United Kingdom will do its best to seek a mutually acceptable mediation with other member states. If mediation fails, then the issue of passing the Lytton Report will naturally arise. The United Kingdom's attitude towards the Lytton Report is also equally clear. The United Kingdom believes that the Lytton Report is the most obvious source of information that can be adopted for the report under Article 15, Section 4 of the Covenant. However, the Committee of Nineteen must first declare to the League of Nations General Assembly that mediation has failed, and then the General Assembly can instruct a committee to carry out the work of drafting this report. British officials also firmly denied that League of Nations Secretary-General Drummond had consulted the British government on a compromise plan. (Reuters dispatch, 17th)</p>

<p>(Geneva) British representative Foreign Minister Simon is scheduled to return to London tomorrow night. It is reported that the British government believes that the Manchurian case is becoming increasingly serious, and that Britain's favoritism towards Japan has led to strong opposition from various small countries. In order to carefully discuss countermeasures to the Manchurian case, it has been decided to convene a cabinet meeting on the 19th. British Foreign Minister Simon has been ordered to return to the country to participate and report on the proceedings of the Committee of Nineteen meeting. (China Allied Press dispatch, 17th)</p>

<p>(Geneva) The Chinese government has telegraphed General Zhang Xueliang's report on the Shanhaiguan incident to the Chinese delegation to the League of Nations, which has now sent a copy of this telegram to the League of Nations, stating that this matter was actually due to the Japanese side threatening the Chinese side, saying that if the four demands were not immediately acknowledged, they would occupy Yucheng by force, and that the Japanese were the first to open fire. The statement that a compromise was signed with Japan is completely untrue. Japan claims that the purpose of its attack was to prevent the Chinese army from advancing towards Manchuria, but in reality, it wanted to quickly occupy Rehe. The Japanese army fought for three days before occupying Shanhaiguan. Its troops were blocked by the Chinese army at Shihe'an, and its coordinated attack plan failed to materialize. The Japanese are demanding that the Shanhaiguan incident be treated as a local issue. The League of Nations, at the request of the Chinese delegation, has distributed this notice to all member states of the League of Nations Extraordinary General Assembly. (Havas dispatch, 16th)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) After the cabinet meeting decided on the instructions to the Japanese delegation to Geneva today, they were immediately issued. It is reported that the delegates were instructed to oppose the suggestion of inviting non-League members to participate in the discussion of the small committee, and to insist that the small committee must not interfere with direct Sino-Japanese negotiations. (Reuters dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese Foreign Ministry telegraphed Representative Matsuoka at 5 p.m. today regarding the revisions proposed to the League of Nations. The contents are as follows: 1. Paragraph 6 of the first resolution and the Chairman's statement proposes inviting non-League countries to participate in the small committee. This proposal must be deleted. 2. The resolution proposes to use Chapter 9 of the Lytton Report as an important reference for resolving the dispute. It must be changed to say that some parts of Chapter 9 can be used as a reference for mediation. 3. Regarding the understanding of the cause of the Sino-Japanese dispute, the Lytton Report believes that all reports from Chapter 1 to Chapter 8 are pertinent. The word "all" must be changed to "some." 4. Japan's request for amendment should be considered a legitimate request. 5. If the League of Nations accepts Japan's amendment, the Japanese representative should earnestly declare a reservation to invoke Article 15 and abstain from voting during the General Assembly decision. 6. If the amendment is not accepted, further instructions must be requested for further review of countermeasures. (China Allied Press dispatch, 17th)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) Since the Japanese Foreign Ministry telegraphed Matsuoka, demanding that the League of Nations revise the Drummond proposal again, general diplomatic circles here have speculated that the Japanese Foreign Ministry will not immediately withdraw from the League of Nations. Because the Japanese Foreign Ministry has learned that the pro-Japanese attitude of the Drummond proposal has aroused criticism from various representatives, it has long been anticipated that this amendment cannot be easily accepted. In order to avoid a direct conflict with the League of Nations, the instructions contain a clause instructing Matsuoka not to act rashly and to request further instructions in all matters. According to reports, once Japan withdraws from the League of Nations, Britain and France will lose the opportunity to favor Japan. In this way, Japan will not only fall into an isolated position, but Britain and France will not be able to protect Japan outside the League of Nations. The balance of international power will be destroyed, leading to a more complex and chaotic situation. It is reported that the countermeasures taken by the Japanese Foreign Ministry are not to withdraw from the League of Nations, but to observe the process with a wait-and-see attitude. The Japanese Foreign Ministry believes that although the League of Nations will forcibly mediate with Article 15, Paragraph 4, if Japan still does not accept it, it will impose severe sanctions with Paragraph 6 and Article 16. However, Japan anticipates that Britain and France will definitely not have the courage to use Article 16. Therefore, it adopted a strategy of neither withdrawing from the League of Nations nor accepting its mediation, avoiding strength and taking gentleness, causing the League of Nations to dig its own grave.

<p>The United States Reaffirms to the World Its Rejection of Situations Created by Force</p>
<h3 id="e12">And Closely Monitors the Progress of the League of Nations' Mediation Efforts. Roosevelt and Hoover's Far East Policies Tend to Converge. <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>(Washington) It is reported that after President-elect Roosevelt and Secretary of State Stimson discussed the Far East and other foreign issues, the US government has telegraphed its representatives in London, Paris, and Geneva to reissue previous declarations, namely, the US government's policy of not recognizing any situation created by means that violate the Kellogg-Briand Pact. (Reuters dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Today, the United States specifically declared to the world that the US government still adheres to its original declaration and does not recognize what Japan has obtained by force in China. The State Department has sent a telegram to its diplomatic representatives in Europe to clarify this point, but it also added that this telegram is not a note to various countries, but merely provides a needle for the compass to various foreign representatives, so that they can inform those who inquire about the US attitude. According to people in the State Department, the US government has received reports that the outside world believes that the US Far East policy is gradually softening, and there are deep fears that this kind of rumor will affect the willingness of Europeans to support the US non-recognition policy. Therefore, it has specifically authorized various foreign representatives to inform anyone who inquires about this matter of this intention. In addition, it has also been learned that European politicians, in view of the fact that the United States is unwilling to formally participate in the discussions of the Committee of Nineteen, have also informally inquired whether the United States is prepared to make concessions on its non-recognition policy. Therefore, the US government has made this statement. However, the US government's statement happened to be issued on the day when the Committee of Nineteen reconvened, so it can be regarded as having significant significance. It is also reported that the telegram issued today has been approved by President-elect Roosevelt, which shows that Roosevelt also shares this policy. Otherwise, the current government, which is about to hand over power, would not necessarily bother to reaffirm it. It is still remembered that after Secretary of State Stimson had a long talk with Roosevelt about foreign policy a few days ago, there was a statement that the two shared the same views on important international issues. Today's statement by the US government further provides clear evidence that a Democratic government will not change its Far East policy. However, the current State Department is still a Republican government, so it cannot be regarded as speaking on behalf of Roosevelt. (National News Agency dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Although the United States has not actively participated in the work of the Committee of Nineteen, the State Department can obtain detailed reports from Ambassador Wilson in Switzerland at any time regarding the actions of the committee. Wilson met with Belgian Foreign Minister Hymans on Sunday night and learned about the contents of the new approach of League of Nations Secretary-General Drummond. Tomorrow, he will have lunch with Japanese representative Matsuoka Yosuke, and all the details of the talks will be telegraphed to the State Department at any time.

<p>(London) According to Washington news, Secretary of State Stimson denied that President Hoover had instructed Ambassador Mellon in Britain to inform the British government that the US authorities believe that the League of Nations mediation policy has failed and that the League of Nations should proceed according to the Covenant. However, the State Department does not deny that the United States believes that the League of Nations mediation has failed. The State Department does not want to interfere with the difficult problem of the League of Nations that it recognizes. The State Department has repeatedly stated that the US believes that a policy of non-interference is extremely important while the League of Nations is reconsidering this difficult problem. It is reported that before British Foreign Secretary Simon left for Geneva, US Ambassador Mellon discussed the US government's views with him. The rumors that Mellon told the British Foreign Secretary that the US government was dissatisfied with Geneva and claimed that now is the time for the League of Nations to take a more active position have all been refuted as inaccurate by the Americans here. All believe that the US government would never instruct the League of Nations on what actions to take. (Reuters dispatch, 16th)</p>

<p>(Washington) Chairman Hudspeth of the US Senate Naval Affairs Committee declared in the Senate today that he was not afraid that Japan would interfere with the Philippines, nor did he see any reason why Japan should not establish a stable government in Manchuria. However, he advocated that the entire US fleet should be permanently stationed in the Pacific. He was not overly alarmed because if there were any disturbances to world peace in the future, they would be in the Pacific. For economic reasons and for actual defense, all fleets should be stationed on the Pacific coast. According to reports, the US Atlantic Fleet has been stationed on the Pacific coast since last year's exercise. Since last autumn, it has actually been regarded as a single unit with the Pacific Fleet in terms of naval administration. The fleet consists of extremely fast cruisers and will conduct tactical exercises with the battleship fleet in the Pacific and Honolulu next month. However, US naval personnel have always claimed that the fleet's stay in the Pacific for the winter is only for economic supplies. Hudspeth is still the first person to openly state that it is for national defense and to cope with contingencies. (National News Agency dispatch, 16th)</p>

The Japanese Foreign Ministry responded to this information by stating that Japan does not expect the United States to recognize "Manchukuo," so its expression of non-recognition is irrelevant. At a time of delicate U.S.-Japan relations, from a personal standpoint, the Japanese government is trying to conceal Stimson's policy failure by proclaiming that non-recognition of "Manchukuo" will not change even under the Roosevelt administration, and that world opinion will not be swayed by it.

<p>— Hui</p>
<p>㈠ What is the Truth About the British-Japanese Compromise?</p>
<p>"The 'Millard's Review' commented on the secret Anglo-French agreement with Japan, saying, '...Britain and France are clearly concerned about their huge interests in Shanghai. The Japanese attack has greatly damaged these interests. Therefore, they are willing to allow Japan to act freely in Manchuria if they withdraw from Shanghai...' This kind of assertion, coming from the mouth of an American, seems to inevitably have some emotional elements. Before the facts are proven, one dare not be certain that it is the truth. However, the London Times of the 13th of this month actually called the conditions of neutrality proposed by Japan a 'spirit of compromise.' This cannot but arouse suspicion. Yesterday's newspaper had briefly discussed this. From the January 28 Incident in 1932 to the present, one year has passed. The results of the League of Nations' investigation have not provided an appropriate and forceful solution to the issue of the occupation of the Northeast. It has dragged on to this day, and the League of Nations has no power to restrain Japan, nor does it intend to restrain Japan. Therefore, the compromise proposal drafted by the Committee of Nineteen still states in the first item of the first resolution that 'the first task of the League of Nations is to strive to mediate disputes, and the current situation... has not yet reached the stage of offering advice containing facts about the dispute and solutions...' Japanese militarism used force without cause. One hundred thousand iron cavalry trampled on the three provinces. It has been a year and four months now. Are the members of the League of Nations unaware of this? On New Year's Eve this year, they bombarded Shanhaiguan again. Now they have broken through the nine gates, occupied Rehe, and are eyeing Tianjin and Beiping. How can it be said that 'it has not yet reached the stage of offering advice containing facts about the dispute...'? I don't know how it must be before it can be called a 'fact of dispute.' Examining the inside story, it is not about the nature of the dispute, but about what tacit understanding exists between Britain and Japan."</p>
<p>㈡ Economic Relations Between China and Britain</p>
<p>The Japanese army invaded the Northeast, creating the so-called "national self-determination" and establishing a puppet state that is neither fish nor fowl. They proclaimed to the world that their intention was to prevent the southward invasion of Red Russia and to be a Great Wall of capitalism in East Asia. Britain also believed that this was necessary to protect India's security, prevent chaos in China, and consolidate its interests in China for the long term. Little did they know that Japan's "continental policy" is insatiably greedy. In the past, they only spoke of the economic interests of Liaoning and Jilin. Last year, they invaded northern Manchuria, reaching Jinzhou and Yi County. This year, they have captured Yuguan and intend to reach Rehe in the east. If Japan's aggression succeeds, how can the interests of the Beining Railway be guaranteed? Can the Kailuan Coal Mine be enjoyed for a long time? Not only that, but the North China market will probably become the second Manchuria. The economic power of the British will probably be completely driven out.</p>
<p>What is even more serious is that China has many things that need to be developed with foreign capital. China and Britain have also been called friendly. British investment in China exceeds 253.2 million pounds. There is still great hope for the future, because China needs capital and Britain has idle capital. However, Japan has been taking advantage of the European War over the past 20 years and using the political chaos in our country to stir up trouble everywhere. Its investment in China has also reached 2.5 billion yen. Except for railway investment, which is not as large as Britain's, its financial capital and light industrial construction in the Yangtze River and North China are superior to Britain. If we add the support of political power and the forceful disposal of military power, then the old British Empire will probably seek safety but get harm instead.</p>
<p>Moreover, the Japanese government is unusually cunning and has a reputation for having a double-edged diplomacy. Recently, they have been advocating the Monroe Doctrine of East Asia. In the South China region and in India, they are trying their best to express goodwill to the local people, trying to buy them off and help them gain independence in order to carry out their ambition of economic aggression and political development. One wonders why Britain recognizes the enemy as a friend.</p>
<p>㈢ Misunderstanding of Tacit Agreement with Japan</p>
<p>The British clearly understand the advantages and disadvantages and know the difference between right and wrong. They still have some sympathy for the national movement in India and are trying to achieve peace between Britain and India.</p>
<p>Although China has been weak for a long time, the people, after the chaos, are seeking survival in the midst of death and are striving to exist. They will never succumb to the violence of Japan. In the future, they will work harder to regenerate themselves, hoping to contribute to the world. With the strength of 400 million people, they will surely be able to save themselves. The British should have a clear and thorough understanding of this. First, they should recognize that the current China is making rapid progress and is definitely not comparable to 20 or 30 years ago. Second, they should recognize that if China fully achieves its ideal construction and fully develops its industries, it will not only be harmless to Britain, but there will also be a lot of economic mutual benefit. Third, they should recognize that China's struggle against Japan is a matter of life and death for the nation. If Japan immediately abandons its policy of aggression, then peace in East Asia can be permanently guaranteed. If Britain unfortunately helps Japan and suppresses China, thinking that it can seek temporary peace, the result will be the opposite. After Japan annexed the Northeast, the whole situation in East Asia has been shaken. If they invade North China again, China will be transformed into a battlefield, and how much of world peace can be maintained? Fourth, they should recognize that the Chinese people are diligent, hardworking, and have a strong endurance that is difficult for other nations in the world to match. If they are forced to engage in a death struggle, they will not hesitate to continue for generations. A century of national hatred has been forged between China and Japan, which is not a blessing for the future of world peace.</p>
<p>At this time, Britain should be absolutely neutral and should not accommodate the evil facts created by Japan's military force and fuel its ferocity, making the East Asian dispute increasingly incomprehensible and delaying it until it harms world peace and damages Britain's own interests. Do not mistakenly believe that the Chinese are foolish in their forbearance and that the Japanese can be trusted in their hypocrisy.</p>

Our troops on the Shi River front line are still firmly defending the west bank, while the enemy is stationed at Jiaoshan and the Zhaocao Camp area on the east bank of the Shi River, building defensive works manned by puppet troops.

<p>(Beiping) By order of Mutō, commander of the Japanese Kwantung Army, the pseudo Fengshan Railway and the Shenyang-Jihai railways have dispatched forty trainloads of soldiers, concentrating them at HuangguTuan in Shenyang. It is said that they are transporting troops westward. (17th, Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to Japanese news, the Japanese army, which is about to attack Rehe, has decided to postpone the invasion until early March due to the weather and international relations. Our official observation is that the Japanese invasion of Rehe is expected, but we are determined to resist to the death and will not risk a rash action. It has always been Japan's policy to invade when we are weak and to change course when we are strong. The Shanghai and Yuguan incidents were both reversals. Although the strength of China and Japan is different, we can endure the pain of defeat, while Japan will collapse if it encounters setbacks. In short, we are determined to resist and will eventually find a way out. (17th, Central News Agency)</p>
<p>(Beiping) People from Tongliao said that a rumor suddenly spread in Tongliao last week that the Chinese government would send planes to bomb Tongliao, causing Japanese merchants in the city to panic and flee.

<p>Ma Su Still in Tomsk</p>
<h3 id="e24">Attends Grand Review, Delivers Speech to Russian Army, Report on Japanese Atrocities Has Been Sent Out <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>(Rumor of Ding Chao's Capture Unconfirmed</p>
<p>Potential Strength of Volunteer Army Still Enormous)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Ma Su has retreated to Russia and is still in Tomsk. It is said that the government has remitted hundreds of thousands of dollars to allow Ma Su and his troops to return to China. Li Du has retreated to Russia and has arrived in Khabarovsk, where he will meet with Ma Su. Although Ding Chao's whereabouts are still unknown, the Japanese report that Ding has been captured is inaccurate. Although the Northeast Volunteer Army has been temporarily quiet due to the departure of its leaders and weather conditions, its potential strength is enormous and will rise up to resist Japan when the green cornfields appear. (17th, Central News Agency)</p>
<p>(Beiping) He Shengda, secretary-general of Su Bingwen, issued a cold telegram from Omsk, stating that Su's report on Japanese atrocities has been completed. The book contains eight chapters and thirty-six sections, detailing the conspiracies and atrocities of the Japanese army in the Northeast from the September 18th Incident to the present. It was sent to the Chinese delegation in Geneva on the 11th for submission to the League of Nations. Karahan recently telegraphed Su, saying that the funds remitted by the Chinese government have arrived and will be allocated immediately. Su and Ma have decided to return to China with important military officers and soldiers due to the urgency of the Yuguan and Rehe situation. They are studying the route through Xinjiang or Outer Mongolia and will be able to leave soon. The refugees who entered Russia with them will remain in Russia temporarily due to insufficient funds. Currently, both the government and the people in Soviet Russia feel tense. Factories are working day and night, and the army is intensifying its exercises. Russian newspapers are advocating that China should declare war on Japan. (17th, Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) On the 10th, Su Bingwen was invited by the Omsk Labor Club to give a speech, saying that the success of the first five-year plan in Soviet Russia was the result of everyone's hard work, but they should not be optimistic because there are imperialists who are jealous of this success and are constantly provoking incidents. He hoped that everyone would continue to maintain their past spirit, reduce consumption, and increase production in order to fight the invaders in the future. (17th, Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Chinese people in Beiping do not believe the rumors in Harbin that Ding Chao was captured by Japanese soldiers. According to Ding's representative in Beiping, Ding fled to Russian territory when the Japanese army attacked Suifenhe and is now meeting with General Su Bingwen and others in Omsk. Japanese officials in Beiping have not received any news about Ding Chao's whereabouts, so they cannot confirm the capture. (17th, Reuters)</p>
<p>(Beiping) On the 12th, a grand review of the Russian army was held in Omsk. The Russian side invited Su Bingwen, Ma Zhanshan, and others to attend and give speeches. In addition to praising the Russian army, Su said that Japanese imperialists are trying to create an Asian empire and are willing to destroy world peace and invade China. Everyone must know that invading China is the first step for Japan to rule Asia. He also said that Japan is colluding with a certain country, and its ferocity is increasing. Although the direct conflict is with China today, the indirect conflict is with Soviet Russia. Everyone should be a god of peace and punish those who destroy peace. Finally, he said that "lips are gone, teeth are cold" is the best analogy for China and Russia. If Soviet Russia helps China, it is equal to Soviet Russia saving itself. (17th, Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Beiping) A gentleman who returned from Qinhuangdao after observing the war talked about how orderly the military situation on the front lines is and how supplies are piled up like mountains. He Zhuguo has ordered that they be distributed equally to the combat brigades. He said, "I have dedicated myself to the country. The defense is solid, and the morale of the army is very stable. I am determined to have a grasp of the war." Because he was ordered by the central government, he could not make a statement casually. While he was speaking, a scout reported that several enemy tanks were attacking us. He replied, "Our army is ready," and looked calm. Then he went to visit the trenches and saw that the soldiers were in great need of ear muffs, leather coats, trousers, woolen lining, cotton shoes, and other items, and hoped that compatriots would generously donate.

Although a reply was received, the Central Government had not clearly indicated any concrete anti-Japanese strategies. Since the fall of Yu, Japanese aggression has intensified. Calls for resisting Japan and saving the nation have spread far and wide from all provinces, and Yan Gu and others have also telegraphed, urging the government to thoroughly resist Japan. This shows that the people at home and abroad share a unified spirit of resisting Japan. Given the international situation, survival is impossible without resisting Japan. Currently, Rehe is on the verge of collapse, and Beiping and Tianjin are in imminent danger. It is requested that the government quickly express a definite anti-Japanese stance, and expedite the allocation of military supplies and pay to the front-line troops to alleviate the anxieties of the people, rectify international perceptions, and inspire the nation to jointly avert the crisis. If you continue to be unrepentant, harming the country and the people, the Southwest will have no choice but to unite with comrades in all provinces and the people of the nation to shoulder this responsibility, to advance the difficult task of national resistance against Japan.

<p>The Course of Russo-Japanese Negotiations on Non-Aggression Treaty</p>
<h3 id="e73">Russia States It Maintains a Peaceful Policy, Proposes a Treaty; Japan Thinks the Time Is Not Ripe, Ambitions Clearly Revealed <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>(Moscow) TASS released today the official documents regarding the Japanese-Russian negotiations for signing a non-aggression treaty. The full text is as follows:</p>
<p>"On December 13, 1932, the Japanese Foreign Ministry verbally conveyed to Soviet Ambassador to Japan, Troyanovsky, the Japanese government's response to the Soviet proposal to sign a non-aggression treaty. The Soviet proposal was made on December 31, 1931, when Yoshizawa passed through Moscow on his way back to Tokyo to take over as Foreign Minister, by Litvinov on behalf of the Soviet government. In its reply, the Japanese government stated that opinions within Japan were quite divided on the timing of signing such a treaty. Supporters believed that the establishment of a non-aggression treaty could guarantee the proper resolution of future disputes between the two countries. Opponents believed that the possible causes of disputes should be eliminated first, before considering the general issue of signing a non-aggression treaty. The Japanese government also believes that the time for concluding a non-aggression treaty is not yet ripe, and therefore it should first address the various issues that affect the mutual relations between the two countries. The Japanese government indicated that at present, both countries could exchange views and decide on a method to prevent or resolve disputes arising from contact between the two countries' armies peacefully on the spot, such as organizing a joint Japanese-Russian-"Manchukuo" committee to prevent border incidents from occurring. Regarding the Japanese government's rejection of signing a non-aggression treaty, Troyanovsky also sent a reply to the Japanese Foreign Minister on January 4, 1933. Troyanovsky stated that the Soviet government was very pleased with the support of a portion of the Japanese for signing a non-aggression treaty, but regretted that the Japanese government could not adopt this view and held the opposite opinion, as the logical development of this opposing view would inevitably be a complete rejection of the fundamental concept of a non-aggression treaty and the Kellogg-Briand Pact's approach to resolving disputes through international renunciation of war. Troyanovsky also stated that the Japanese government's opinion clearly assumes that a non-aggression treaty can only be signed when there are no points of contention between the two countries. However, in the current state of economic and political interdependence among nations, especially between neighboring countries, it is impossible to have no points of contention. Even if temporary differences are resolved, there is no guarantee that they will not arise again in the future. Furthermore, countries that have already concluded non-aggression treaties with the Soviet Union have not considered themselves to have no mutual points of contention or demands with the Soviet Union in doing so. Recently, the Soviet Union agreed to conclude a non-aggression treaty with a neighboring country that has a border dispute with the Soviet Union and claims sovereignty over a certain territory. Therefore, the Soviet government's view of non-aggression treaties and the Kellogg-Briand Pact is that countries acknowledge the existence of points of contention or the possibility of points of contention arising, but decide to renounce the use of force to resolve such points of contention. On the Soviet government's side, it feels that there are no points of contention between the Soviet Union and Japan that cannot or should be refused to be resolved peacefully. To refuse would contradict the Kellogg-Briand Pact, which was jointly signed by Japan and Russia. The Soviet government's proposal to conclude a non-aggression treaty with Japan is not intended to disregard the Kellogg-Briand Pact, but merely to strengthen it with a bilateral agreement to adapt it to the specific circumstances of the relationship between the two countries. Troyanovsky continued, the Soviet proposal is not based on the current situation, but is based on the Soviet Union's entire peaceful policy, and hopes that it can be maintained for a long time. At the same time, the Soviet government doubts whether one party's refusal to sign a non-aggression treaty is conducive to resolving disputes and eliminating misunderstandings between the two countries. In addition, the Soviet government specifically pointed out that in the Japanese government's verbal reply, there was the phrase "Japan and the Soviet Union are both willing to mutually respect each other's sovereignty and absolutely prohibit infringing on each other's borders," saying that if this intention can be strictly adhered to, then even though Japanese troops are currently approaching the Soviet border, there should not be more border incidents than before. Finally, the Soviet government stated that it is prepared to study and consider the Japanese proposal to organize a joint Japanese-Russian-"Manchukuo" committee, believing that it may be possible to organize a committee similar to those the Soviet Union has with neighboring countries such as Romania and Poland to prevent border disputes.

<p>Content of Saito's Speech to Parliament</p>
<h3 id="e74">Still Claiming to Resolve the Yuguan Incident and Hoping for Close Sino-Japanese Relations? <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 17th (Japan Allied News) Prime Minister Saito will deliver a policy speech in Parliament on the direction of his administration and other important issues. The draft has been completed, and the content is roughly as follows: ㈠ Foreign Affairs: Regarding the League of Nations policy, the government is determined to adhere to its beliefs and proceed in accordance with the established policy. The recent Yuguan Incident is deeply regrettable in Sino-Japanese relations. The government intends to resolve this issue satisfactorily with sincerity and hopes for close Sino-Japanese relations. ㈡ The 1933 Budget: The Hamaguchi Cabinet implemented an extremely tight fiscal policy. However, since the Manchurian Incident, the domestic and international situations have become serious. Military spending for the army and navy had to be increased, and other important expenses were also expanded. As a result, the budget has become a huge number. ㈢ The large budget poses a dangerous impact on the national finances in the future. The government is currently considering these criticisms, and the Ministry of Finance is also deliberating countermeasures. According to the government's forecast, the Japanese economy will definitely improve between 1933 and 1934. It also believes that the current dilapidated rural areas will be able to return to their original state by 1934. The issue of tax increases will be considered after this recession disappears. ㈣ Efforts to address emergency issues: The government already has considerable measures, but the actions of left and right-wing groups within the country are endless. The government is determined to do its utmost to supervise and guide public opinion and to reform national education. ㈤ Explain the reasons for submitting various bills such as debt consolidation, rice control, pension law revision, and election law revision.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 17th (Reuters) The Emperor and Empress went to the Hayama Seaside Imperial Villa on January 9. Because Parliament will convene on the 21st, they returned to Tokyo this morning. Prime Minister Saito is currently drafting the opening speech, which will be submitted to the Cabinet for approval on the 19th and read in Parliament on the 21st. It is expected that it will focus on foreign affairs, and the Sino-Japanese dispute will certainly be at the forefront, but it will also present the financial situation.</p>
<p>Japanese Military Clique Organizes Fascist Party</p>
<h3 id="e75">Using Retired Soldiers as Core Members <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 17th (Japan Allied News) After the shocking May 15th Incident, a fascist atmosphere permeated Japan. The fascist political party, the National Alliance (led by Kodama Yoshizo), has already emerged. Recently, however, retired soldiers across the country have advocated organizing a new political group to eliminate both extreme left and right wings and to praise imperial rule. These include Lieutenant General Kishi, former commander of the Shimonoseki Fortress; Lieutenant General Takata, former commander of the China Garrison; Lieutenant General Todoriki, former principal of the Army Toyama School; and Lieutenant General Takayama, former commander of the 10th Division, as well as naval reserve officers such as Commanders Kosaka, Komine, and Nakamura. More than 60 influential retired soldiers and civilians across the country who resonated with this idea have held preparatory meetings since December of last year to discuss the issue of organizing a new group. As a result, it was decided to organize a new political group called the Imperial Way Society, drafting its principles, program, and articles of association, and soliciting members from retired soldiers across the country. A conference will be held in Tokyo soon. Its program aims to thoroughly implement imperial rule and to promote the essence of the Japanese national polity. Its purpose is to break the accumulated abuses of existing political parties, establish fair politics, abolish the capitalist economic system, and implement a national controlled economic system.</p>

<p>Athens, 16th (Reuters) After the resignation of the Theodaris Cabinet on January 13, a new cabinet has now been organized by the 68-year-old prominent politician Venizelos. Venizelos himself serves as Prime Minister, and Kafantaris is appointed Minister of Finance, Michalakopoulos as Minister of Foreign Affairs, and Katachakis as Minister of the Army. During the European War, Venizelos strongly supported the Allied Powers and repeatedly asked King Constantine to join the Allied side, but the King and the General Staff repeatedly deemed it impossible. Venizelos later broke with the King and established a provisional revolutionary government in Salonika. In 1917, King Constantine abdicated, Alexander succeeded him, and Venizelos was summoned back to Tokyo to serve as Prime Minister of the National Government. The victory of the Allied forces in Salonika was largely due to Venizelos's assistance.</p>

<p>Berlin, 16th (National News Agency) The leader of the National Socialist Party, Hitler, convened thousands of members of the Stormtroopers in Weimar today and announced that he would resume the old methods of struggle, claiming that after each election victory of the party, there were attempts to induce the party to negotiate a compromise plan, making its victory futile. However, my determination not to retreat an inch is now even more resolute, and such attempts cannot succeed, etc. Originally, party members were deeply afraid of losing the general election due to the party's financial exhaustion and the Germans' growing weariness of his empty talk of national salvation, so they have been relatively quiet recently. This sudden change in strategy is the natural result of the victories in the recent Lippeburg election and the Ruhr municipal election. However, since the party is determined to oppose the current government, newspapers from the right to the left generally expect the dissolution of Parliament to be inevitable. A general election will soon be seen again. It is expected that Prime Minister Schleicher, in order to reduce commercial turmoil, will shorten the election campaign period as much as possible. Some people predict that Parliament will reconvene on January 24, pass a vote of no confidence in the government, and then be dissolved immediately, with another election on February 19. This afternoon, Schleicher had a long talk with Kass, the leader of the Center Party, reportedly discussing the impact of the National Socialist Party's coup strategy, etc.</p>
<p>Trends in French Political Tides</p>
<h3 id="e78">Financial Proposals Passed by Cabinet <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>Paris, 16th (Reuters) The French Minister of Finance's financial proposals were approved by the Cabinet meeting today and will be submitted to the Finance Committee of the Chamber of Deputies for discussion tomorrow. The Chamber of Deputies will not begin debate before the end of this week. The atmosphere on this issue is now more optimistic.</p>
<p>Paris, 16th (National News Agency) The situation here remains unchanged, and the position of the Cabinet is still very precarious. The Prime Minister and his colleagues, as well as many independent observers, believe that the slightly revised proposals of the Minister of Finance are the minimum requirement of the people, as they are necessary to place national finances on a solid foundation and enable the budget to be balanced. As for the civil servants' strike, political leaders are not concerned, as this is only a temporary inconvenience and will not last long. A general strike of public service employees is unlikely to be realized in the near future due to lack of consensus. People in Parliament now seem to be in no hurry to take power, as the budget is difficult to establish without increasing taxes, reducing government spending, or reducing army and navy expenditures. Therefore, the Peng Gune Cabinet may be able to make slight concessions to the opposition and overcome the difficulties, which is also unknown.</p>

<p>Japanese 1933 War Budget (Japan News)</p>
<h3 id="e83">Militaristic Policy and Preparation to Attack Russia, Expanded Expenditures and Financial Crisis <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>In recent years, the impoverishment of the working masses in Japan has increased daily. However, the Japanese government's budget for 1933 has revenue of only 1.2 billion yen, while expenditures reach a huge 2.237 billion yen. This shows how the Japanese imperialists are trembling in the face of the crisis of bankruptcy and how they are trying to avoid this terrible crisis. The bulk of the budget revenue comes from taxes (56%) and government industries and assets (36%). Since 1930, fear and poverty have been incessant in Japanese society, making it impossible for the working masses to pay taxes. Moreover, indirect tax payers, who account for 56% of taxes, have also suffered losses in their payments due to the decline in mass purchasing power and the reduction in sales of consumer goods (1931). At the same time, the poverty of the masses has also reduced the profits from monopolies such as tobacco, so revenue has also shown a trend of resentment and decline since 1930. At the same time, the amount of expenditures has had to increase greatly due to the urgency of the war situation. The emergence of the so-called "deficit budget" (surplus budget) has also lasted for three years. However, the unbalance between revenue and expenditure and the fiscal expansion in the 1933 budget are unprecedented.</p>
<p>Regarding the 1933 budget, the government-controlled newspapers said that the reasons for the expansion are three: First, the expansion of military spending; Second, the emergency relief expenses; Third, the expansion of public debt expenses.</p>
<p>(Military Spending) First, military spending refers to the Manchurian Incident expenses and the military preparedness improvement expenses. The Manchurian Incident expenses are allocated for use in Manchuria's defense and security maintenance. No matter how eloquently Matsuoka Yosuke speaks at the League of Nations, the "Manchukuo puppet state" is completely a puppet under the wings of Japanese imperialism. This fact is undeniable. After the Japanese imperialists "created" this puppet state, they also bear such a huge budget for it. The Japanese government was originally a girl in the arms of the warlords, so naturally it does not hesitate to invest a large amount of funds for warlord wars, opening roads, laying railways, and arming Yilan and Fujin in the Songhua River area, preparing for the main road for future wars with the Soviet Union. Moreover, Qiqihar is used as its starting point, passing through the Greater Khingan Mountains, the Outer Mongolian Republic, Hailar, and Manchouli to attack Siberia. However, the Japanese working masses are squeezed out of their own blood tax for the use of this purpose.</p>
<p>Secondly, there are the military preparedness improvement expenses, totaling 290 million yen, of which:</p>
<p>On the Army side:</p>
<p>Enhancement of military strength in Manchuria and reorganization of domestic troops: 138,137,000 yen</p>
<p>Supplementary Education: 9,291,000 yen</p>
<p>Improvement of various short-term emergency systems: 12,092,000 yen</p>
<p>Replenishment and reorganization of combat materials: 87,850,000 yen</p>
<p>On the Navy side:</p>
<p>New warship maintenance fees: 15,195,000 yen</p>
<p>Expenses for air squadrons, aircraft, and other equipment: 15,594,000 yen</p>
<p>Additional amount for warship manufacturing fees: 15,000,000 yen</p>
<p>Warship modification fees: 20,688,000 yen</p>
<p>Military preparedness enhancement and improvement fees: 21,710,000 yen</p>
<p>Army Minister Araki loudly shouted, "We want to conquer the world, and national defense and military preparedness enhancement fees are absolutely indispensable." This sentence has now reached the stage of implementation. If you don't believe it, please see:</p>
<p>The large airfield plan in Toyohara, Sakhalin;</p>
<p>The major modification and armament plan for the national highway from Otomari/Toyohara to the Soviet border;</p>
<p>The Niigata large airfield plan;</p>
<p>The construction of a candidate airfield in Hama-Kurosaki, Toyama Prefecture;</p>
<p>The large construction of Tsuruga Port;</p>
<p>The large-scale reconstruction and large-scale exercises at Maizuru Port;</p>
<p>The implementation of the Tadaumi poison gas factory and air defense facilities in the Kita-Kyushu area in Hiroshima Prefecture;</p>
<p>Reconstruction of Cheongjin Port near the Korean border and development of shipping from Cheongjin Port to Tsuruga;</p>
<p>The Luo Xin large port construction plan;</p>
<p>The layout of the Japan-Korea-Manchuria air network;</p>
<p>The establishment of the Manchuria Aviation Company;</p>
<p>The designation of a candidate airfield in Dongshi Township, Tainan Prefecture, Taiwan;</p>
<p>The expansion of the Jiadong Airfield area;</p>
<p>The construction and reconstruction of long-distance bus roads;</p>
<p>Wireless communication between Taipei and Manila;</p>
<p>The Japan Petroleum Company's plan to increase oil production in Jinshui, etc.</p>
<p>Among the improvements in the treatment of soldiers that have already been implemented are the increase in officers and students, the reorganization of tank squadrons, the establishment of a cadre candidate system and a specialist non-commissioned officer system, and the recent formation of a "warrior" team to suppress the internal turmoil in the army.</p>
<p>This huge amount of military facilities expenses and the most active munitions factories are intertwined, implementing a very high-intensity labor policy for all workers. Since most of the Japanese munitions factories are state-owned institutions, they forcibly implement their military management by using the names of "war" and "emergency" to reject all economic and political demands.

<p>He Zhuguo Vows to Fight to the Death</p>
<h3 id="e84">Expressing to the Japanese Representative on the Drafting of the Peace Agreement for Beiping and Saying the Positions Are Solid and Our Army Is Confident <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>Beiping Communication: The Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association of all circles in Beiping recently sent representatives with more than 40 boxes of wool gloves and other items to Yuguan to comfort the soldiers at the front. The representatives completed their mission on the 12th and returned to Beiping. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e85">Representatives Inspect the Battlefield <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>Each representative took the Beiping-Liaoning Railway's</p>
<p>8th train east in the morning of the 10th, arriving at Beidaihe at 6 PM. The adjutant Meng Zhengsheng and the quartermaster Zhao, from the 9th Brigade's station office, greeted them at the station and transferred the comfort items to a special train. At the same time, 13 male and female students from the Yanjing University Comfort Group brought items with them. The two groups then joined forces. Because it was too late, they changed their plans to visit Commander He the next morning. At 5 AM the next morning, Commander He sent two military vehicles to the station to pick them up. After traveling about 50 miles to the headquarters, they were warmly received by Adjutant Ding Shilin and others. After the meal, the representatives went to inspect the surrounding area and saw that some trenches had been built, while others were still under construction. Because the weather was very cold, the ground was frozen about one foot deep, so they had to burn firewood until the frozen ground melted before they could work. It was not until 3 PM that they visited Commander He. At this time, the Nankai University Comfort Group also arrived, and the three groups were received at the same time. First, the representative of the Anti-Japanese Association explained the intention of the visit. Then, Commander He delivered a speech of thanks.</p>
<h3 id="e86">Commander He Zhuguo Talks <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>Commander He said in his speech, "I am deeply ashamed of the unfortunate loss of Shanhaiguan this time. I am very grateful for the visit and gifts from the representatives of various groups. I would like to briefly describe the course of the incident. The Japanese army's attack on Shanhaiguan this time did not have a real target. Because Shanhaiguan was bound by the Boxer Protocol, it has been virtually open for 30 years. Since the September 18th Incident, the Japanese have arbitrarily increased troops and deployed defenses under the pretext of the treaty, while we have not been able to increase troops freely. The two armies were originally separated by the Great Wall. Later, the puppet state's military police entered the station within the pass, and from then on, there were increasing troubles. Their intention to occupy Rehe and complete the puppet state's plan was clearly revealed. At the beginning of the incident, I was in Beiping on official business, and the Japanese army tried their best to create rumors and provocations, while we tried to seek perfection. We also told the Japanese that all problems would be resolved after I returned to defense. The Japanese army could not wait and began to attack, limiting us to allowing four conditions within 50 minutes. I ask you, if we allowed these conditions, it would be better to clearly cede Shanhaiguan, which could save the residents from bloodshed. After I returned to defense, I quickly stepped up the deployment of defenses in various places. Because I was restricted by the Boxer Protocol in advance, I could not increase troops. Increasing troops would be regarded by the Japanese as taking hostile actions, so only three battalions were stationed in the city. The defense project was arranged secretly. The Japanese army advanced on three sides, sea, land, and air. Although our army resisted fiercely, the disparity in weapons and manpower was too great. The Japanese army surrounded the southeast and west cities and set up an artillery position on the northeast corner of the highlands outside the city, bombarding our soldiers defending the city, so that the Japanese army could climb the city. Our army was attacked from both sides, and all four gates were closed. The only way out for our army was the Xicheng Water Gate. However, the Japanese army was already waiting there and used machine guns to strafe, so that the entire battalion was wiped out. It cannot be said that it was not miserable. After our army retreated, the Japanese army thought they could pursue our army to the Luanhe area, so that there would be no worries about advancing into Rehe. Compared to attacking Rehe from the Kailu area, it would be twice as effective. This was the original plan. Unexpectedly, although our army retreated, they immediately consolidated their defenses in the Shihe area and defeated the Japanese army's pursuing team of more than 1,000 people. The reason why the Japanese army failed to enter the Luanhe was the resistance of our army's new defense line. On the evening of the second, a Japanese train drove to Shanhaiguan but did not get off. Later, because the pursuit of our army failed, the Japanese withdrew this train of troops and announced to the world that this was a local issue and that the commander of the Tianjin Garrison would resolve it, separate from the Kwantung Incident, and minimize the scope. The Japanese army sent a letter to me asking to negotiate with them. I have replied that my responsibility from now on is only to defend the territory and that this incident should be resolved by the central government. There is no change in the positions of both sides and they are currently in a stalemate. In short, the defense of the front line is generally undertaken by our army, and we have full confidence. Please rest assured, I am determined to die and then stop, and I will try my best to deal with it.</p>
<p>I don't think there will be any major changes, but the Japanese are full of tricks. If this plan doesn't work, they may expose their hideous face and disrupt other places, or even cause a second world war. This is the awakening that our nation should have and prepare for early. There may be no major war recently, but if there is a war, it will break out in various places at the same time. Soldiers have always regarded dying on the battlefield as their duty, but for all other matters, we cannot but hope that the people will rise up and work together to overcome the national crisis."</p>

<p>Reports from various representatives who recently inspected the troops indicated high morale. However, the soldiers, despite having cotton-padded jackets and trousers, lacked leather hats and greatcoats, resulting in many suffering frostbite on their hands and feet. One representative spoke with a soldier and gifted him his own gloves. The soldiers gathered to discuss this, saying that the representatives of various groups were diligently working to deliver donated goods and were confident of defeating the Japanese. After returning to Peiping, the representatives considered winter gear the most pressing need for the soldiers at the front and planned to unite various sectors to raise funds for collecting padded vests, cotton gloves, woolen socks, and other items to send to the front lines in succession.

<p>Fengjing Town, in the county, sits on the border of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. It is divided by a boundary river, and the urban area is prosperous with thriving commerce. However, since Zhejiang Province strictly prohibited opium, Fengjing became a major outlet. All trafficking operations centered in Songjiang, distributing to nearby areas. The trade was so lucrative that daily sales reportedly reached thousands of taels of silver. The scale was grand, almost like Shanghai's opium dens, with open sales and no fear. These groups transported goods secretly with ingenious methods, and despite investigations, few cases were solved. Recently, the Fourth District Party Branch in the town, noting the near-public sale of opium, telegraphed the Prosecutor's Office for a thorough investigation. Chief Prosecutor Zhu secretly ordered Judicial Police Chief Sheng Dexin to investigate Fengjing covertly, without making a sound, and arrest the culprits when possible. The police chief went yesterday (17th) and visited the District Party Branch to inquire. He learned that after the District Party Branch's report, the opium traffickers, realizing the difficulty of maintaining their operation, had temporarily ceased activities. The main traffickers had also reportedly left the town. Sheng returned to Songjiang to report.</p>

<p>Tao Hongshu, a resident of No. 6 Xiaolou Lane in the city, was 36 years old. He worked at the Fuxin Flour Mill in Shanghai. He had an elderly father in his seventies and two brothers. The elder brother, Guanlun, had served as the chief of the Public Security Bureau in Songjiang and Baoying counties. The younger brother, Xingsheng, worked in a flour mill in Tianjin. Hongshu was married to a virtuous woman named Zhu, and they had a very close relationship. Last year, they had a daughter, and the couple was very happy. Unfortunately, Zhu fell ill after childbirth, and despite all treatments, she passed away. Since then, Hongshu suffered from mental confusion, mumbling incoherently. Unexpectedly, the Fuxin factory underwent layoffs last year, and Hongshu was among those laid off. This further aggravated his mental state, and he conceived the idea of suicide. The day before yesterday evening, he went to the Hanchang Road Hotel, booked a room, and then committed suicide by poisoning. The next day, the waiter discovered him, but it was too late to revive him.</p>

<p>Wu Fu's family in Dazhuji Village, Chashu Township, Wuyi 18th District, was recently robbed. Li Jianyi of the garrison police squad in Xiaoxinqiao Town reported the incident and dispatched a team to investigate for several days. At approximately 1:00 PM on the 15th, they coordinated with the local militia to arrest Wang Mingzhang, his elder brother Wang Changda, and Mingzhang's nephew Wang Heshang in Beihuangou Village, Shishu. They recovered twenty to thirty pieces of stolen clothing. The suspects were taken into custody for preliminary interrogation and confessed to an accomplice named Ai Huosheng, who was also subsequently arrested. After the victim identified the stolen goods as belonging to them, the squad leader sent the suspects to the headquarters in the city on the 16th for further interrogation.</p>

<p>In the case of the Shipworkers' Union's extortion under false pretenses, Yao Zhiming, Wu Hengfu, and others were handed over to the county by the water police. On the 14th, Judge Wang Cheng interrogated them. According to Yao and the others, the Shipworkers' Union was organized by Chen Xiping, a member of the County Party Committee, through Zhou Linrong. Due to a lack of funds for the Party Committee, a subsidy of two hundred yuan was required. One hundred yuan was paid on December 17th of last year, with a receipt signed by Chen Xiping, a standing committee member of the County Executive Committee. The remaining one hundred yuan was due on schedule, but they could not comply, so they collected it from the membership registration fees, which was not extortion. The judge sentenced Yao Mingzhi to one month of imprisonment, Wu Hengfu to twenty days of detention and a fine of ten yuan, Yao Baoshen to a fine of ten yuan, and Cao Zhengkun to a fine of twenty yuan.</p>

<p>To the editor of Shen Bao:</p>
<p>We are writing in response to a report in your paper of the 14th regarding "Raising Funds under False Pretenses," which stated that an organization called the Shipworkers' Union had set up an office inside the Tianlun Textile Factory in Shejiaqiao and charged fees to passing ships. This is not in accordance with the facts. This type of union was once found in a thatched hut by the river near our factory, but not set up inside our factory. The content is under official investigation. This factory is related to our reputation and we are specially requesting this correction, in order to avoid false rumors. We await a reply, Tianlun Co., Ltd., January 15th.</p>

<h3 id="e101">Issuance of Declaration <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>Declaration of the Shanghai Branch of the China League for Civil Rights: All struggles to secure political, social, economic, and moral liberties have as their fundamental aim the demand for freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and freedom from forceful interference, the right to express opinions, and the right to freely expose and criticize social forces that hinder the happiness of the majority. The concept of genuine democracy has been the guiding principle of all social struggles for three hundred years, and millions have shed blood for it. To this day, it remains the center of social and economic struggles. However, its effect, if it only extends to a few people, cannot be considered a success. Only when the majority of the people enjoy its benefits can democracy be said to be established. Democracy, as the aim of all forward-looking struggles, is undoubtedly true. However, many forces that impede the progress of humanity often attribute the benefits of democracy to a few while depriving others of their due civil rights. The significance of this struggle is particularly important in China today. While the world's population is suffering a fatal blow from economic hardship, the Chinese people must endure the aggression of Japan and other imperialists in addition to the world's hardship. This threat is deeply ingrained in the minds of the Chinese people. Only when the Chinese people can hold their destiny in their own hands and fight for the survival of the nation can there be hope. However, if the people cannot freely unite and freely express their opinions, they cannot fight for the nation. The future of China completely depends on the Chinese people, and the path lies in achieving freedom of thought, freedom of speech, and freedom of action. Otherwise, China will be reduced to Africa, and there will be no other path to future economic, social, and political development. This undeniable fact is proven not only by pen and tongue but also by the history of iron and blood. However, the Chinese people still have no trace of even the most basic civil rights. On the contrary, magazines and newspapers are often banned, and gatherings and associations are often prohibited. In the past five years, hundreds of publications have been banned or had their postal rights suspended. The content of these magazines and newspapers includes various political views, ranging from the extreme left to the extreme right. Not only are the opinions and criticisms of Chinese authors and many purely artistic publications banned, but publications describing social and cultural struggles abroad are also not allowed to circulate in the country. Even possessing such books is sufficient grounds for imprisonment and execution. Those who suffer this misfortune are not limited to publications that criticize domestic or world conditions. We still remember that the Peiping Daobao and the Minguo Daily (the Kuomintang's official newspaper) were banned due to unreasonable demands from Japanese imperialists. In other words, under the current conditions, even the views of the ruling party cannot be safely expressed. The severity of the prohibitions and the secrecy of the network of restrictions are such that even if the editors of banned magazines and newspapers are spared imprisonment, they do not dare to protest. If China wants to resist enemies, and if the Chinese people want to gradually advance to the realm of genuine democracy, then this gag that prevents new ideas, new criticisms, and freedom of speech must be removed. The China League for Civil Rights is willing to awaken the Chinese people and encourage them to strive to realize the benefits of freedom of publication, freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, and freedom of association, all genuine civil rights, to oppose all censorship and prohibitions, and to awaken the people to demand the universal enjoyment of the minimum civil rights and to stop the oppression of writers, artists, and magazine and newspaper editors who are striving for China's progress and liberation.</p>

<p>Mu Ouchu's Sincere Advice to Wu Peifu (Telegram)</p>
<h3 id="e104">Please Do Not Be Deceived by the Japanese <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>Mu Ouchu's telegram to Wu Peifu: "To Mr. Wu Ziyu in Peiping: The Japanese bandits have already swallowed the Northeast and occupied Yuguan, pressing forward step by step, arousing universal indignation throughout the country. All those with blood and spirit are waiting with weapons ready, vowing to fight to the end. Recently, it has been heard that the Japanese side is in the Peiping-Tianjin area, trying to bewitch prominent figures in the opposition, promoting national cooperation in order to oppose the tyranny of warlords, and secretly carrying out a plan to divide China. If they are accidentally given leeway, they will fall into a cunning trap. Your Excellency is deeply insightful and will surely see through their treacherous schemes. If there are Japanese requesting to meet, they should be refused outright. It is also hoped that you will inspire your former subordinates to unite against the enemy and guide the people to resist Japan and boycott Japanese goods. This will both strengthen the respect and admiration of our compatriots at home and prevent the conspiracies of powerful enemies abroad. This humble advice is respectfully offered and should be considered. Mu Xiangyue bows."</p>
<h3 id="e105">Support Association for Volunteer Army Urges Ma Zhanshan and Others to Return Home (Telegram) <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Support Association for the Northeast Volunteer Army telegraphed the National Government, the Executive Yuan, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday, requesting the transportation of Generals Ma Xiufang, Su Ganzhang, and Wei Zhichu back to China, and also telegraphed Ma Zhanshan and others in Vormesk to quickly reorganize their troops and return to China. The two telegrams are transcribed below:</p>
<p>To the National Government (Telegram): "To the esteemed National Government, Executive Yuan, and Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Nanjing: Ma Zhanshan, Chairman of Heilongjiang Province, Su Bingwen, Commander of the Railway Protection Army, and Generals Zhang Dianjiu and Xie Ke, due to exhaustion of ammunition and lack of reinforcements, were unable to continue fighting and retreated into Russian territory. The Association previously telegraphed, requesting prompt relief. Recently, Li Du, Deputy Commander of the Jilin Border Defense Army, has also been forced to retreat into Russia under similar circumstances and is also eagerly awaiting relief. Currently, China and Russia have resumed diplomatic relations, making diplomatic operations easier. Since the government has already remitted funds for relief, immediate steps should be taken to transport Generals Ma, Su, Li, Zhang, and Xie, and the officers and soldiers under their command, back to China, to avoid them staying in a foreign country for too long. This is respectfully requested. Sincerely, Chu Fucheng, Li Cishan, Yin Zhufu, Wu Shan, Feng Shaoshan, Yu Huancheng, Yan Zhifang, Jiang Wenyu, Li Shaochuan, Du Chongyuan, Chen Yafu of the Northeast Volunteer Army Support Association, bow."</p>
<p>Telegram to Ma Zhanshan: "To the Chinese Consulate in Siberia, transferred to Chairman Ma Zhanshan and General Su Bingwen in Vormesk, and to inquire with General Li Du: The Northeast has fallen under the aggression of violent bandits. Fortunately, the generals have successively resisted and fought the enemy for the country, achieving immortal feats in a difficult environment. The hand-to-hand combat has lasted for years, shaking the mountains and rivers. Due to the cut-off of foreign aid and the lack of relief, they have retreated with tears. Looking to the north, their hearts are extremely saddened. The national crisis is critical, and the enemy's threat is intensifying. The generals and their officers and soldiers cannot stay in a foreign country for long. Regardless of the difficulty of the journey, in addition to urging the government to quickly take steps to transport them back, this special telegram requests the generals to quickly reorganize and return home to lead the volunteer army again and recover lost territory. The country's future relies on this. Looking forward to your arrival. "</p>

<p>Deng Wen, a hero of the anti-Japanese war in Heilongjiang, has actively replenished his forces after leading his 10,000 men through Rehe. Recently, he specially appointed Li Mingxin and Ma Kui (son of General Ma Zhanshan) as representatives stationed in Shanghai and has notified all parties by telegram. Yesterday, Mr. Li received a telegram from Commander Deng from Kailu: "To my brother Mingxin: I think of you very much since our departure. I was relieved to receive your telegram. I led my troops to Kailu safely last month. Chairman Ma Tongli (Ma's secretary-general) went abroad from Manchuria. His subordinates and the infantry of Su and Zhang have arrived in Linxi one after another. I have replenished the clothing somewhat with the help of the support association, but there is no financial relief, and I am aware of my financial difficulties. The costs of telegraphing and other expenses are still unpaid. Please report the blood battles that my troops have fought with the enemy to all authorities and organizations so that prompt relief and replenishment can be provided to enable a return to Heilongjiang to continue resistance. Chairman's son Ma Ziyuan (omitted) can contact and cooperate with you. Deng Wen and Li Shiji bow."</p>

If provinces actually feel a shortage of grain and wheat and must ban exports, they should first submit a document to the central government for deliberation and decision, but may not use the excuse of prohibition to collect any levies. The case has been resolved and submitted to the Political Council for transfer to the Lower House, and a separate order will be issued. I hereby urgently telegraph to order you to strictly comply.'

<p>Chinese Taxpayers in the French Concession Request More Chinese Director Seats</p>
<h3 id="e115">Yesterday's Joint Meeting of Executive and Supervisory Committees Proposed <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>The French Concession Chinese Ratepayers Association convened a joint meeting of its executive and supervisory committees yesterday. Those in attendance included Du Yuesheng, Shang Mu Jiang, Cheng Zhusun, Jin Tingsun, Zhu Shengmao, Xu Xiuting, Dong Kegong, Qu Zhenhua, Tong Lizhang, Pan Zhaobang, (Cheng Zhusun substituting for) Xi Jingyan, (Xu Xiuting substituting for). Also invited to attend and participate in the discussions were the current Chinese directors of the French Municipal Council, Lu Bohong, Zhang Xiaolin, Zhu Yanzhi, Wei Tingrong, and Qi Yunqing. Du Yuesheng served as chairman, and Tong Lizhang as recorder. The proceedings were conducted with due formality. The proposed matters were as follows: ㈠ The association previously received a letter from citizens stating that the French Water and Electricity Company was planning to increase prices. The association had sent a letter to the Chinese directors urging them to pay attention to this matter. However, the company repeatedly requested the Municipal Council to hold ad hoc meetings a few days ago, demanding the implementation of the price increase. However, the French Consul-General attached great importance to the case and handled it very fairly. Each of the directors present believed that the company was already making substantial profits and there was no reason to increase prices, and unanimously opposed the proposal, and hence the proposal was not passed at that time. However, in case the company, unable to achieve its wish, resorts to other means against users, it is hoped that citizens will pay special attention. ㈠ The organizational charter of the French Municipal Council is still the temporary committee charter promulgated during the tenure of Consul-General Naziqi in 1926. It has been over seven years and still uses the temporary name without being revised, which is difficult to understand. Moreover, in recent years, the population of Chinese citizens has increased, and the tax amount has also increased year by year, but the number of Chinese directors has not been increased. Compared with the tax obligations fulfilled by Chinese citizens, the rights they should enjoy are very unequal. During the tenure of Consul-General Goring in 1931, after several negotiations, the appointed Chinese directors were changed to formally elected. However, when the list of Chinese directors elected this year was reported to the French Consulate-General for verification, the consulate replied that it would still use the old charter and appoint them, which deprives taxpayers of their right to elect representatives. It is urgent to request the French authorities to amend this temporary committee charter of the French Municipal Council as soon as possible, and increase the number of Chinese directors to comply with the principle of equal treatment between China and France. The association will then submit a request to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to negotiate with the French Minister. ㈠ The association has never had any regular funds. It should, in accordance with the precedent of the Public Concession Chinese Ratepayers Association, request the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to forward a request to the Ministry of Finance to allocate funds. ㈠ The French Concession primary and secondary schools requested subsidies for educational expenses. Each Chinese director should propose to the Municipal Council to request appropriate subsidies and add Chinese children's primary schools to popularize Chinese education in the concession. The meeting adjourned at around 5 o'clock.</p>

<p>Member of the Central Executive Committee Zhang Qun went to Beijing to resolve the issue of the war in Sichuan Province. The Central Government has decided to proceed with the solution to the governance of Sichuan in accordance with the guidelines of the 17th year of the Republic. Therefore, Zhang left Beijing by train yesterday morning and arrived at the North Station at around 8:00 AM, and went directly back to his residence on Avenue Albert.</p>
<p>Last Year, National Customs Revenue Shortfall of 36 Million Taels</p>
<h3 id="e119">Shanghai Alone Reached 15 Million Taels, All Countries' Trade Affected by Japanese Militarism <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>Xinsheng News Agency, Nanjing. After the General Inspectorate of Customs reported the national customs revenue situation for the 21st year to Beijing, the authorities have not officially announced it. However, according to unofficial statements from the Ministry of Finance, the total national customs revenue last year was approximately 200 million Customs Taels, a decrease of approximately 36 million Taels compared to the total revenue of the previous year. Among them, Shanghai alone accounted for a decrease of as much as 15 million Taels. The remaining reductions were losses from the Northeast Customs and other ports. The losses in the Northeast were entirely due to the customs there being seized by the Japanese. The customs there had a small amount of revenue before March. The reason for the decrease in Shanghai was entirely due to the impact of the war. Although China's customs revenue decreased so much last year, it was still able to pay off domestic and foreign debts and indemnities on schedule without any delay. This also proves the Chinese government's credibility at home and abroad. The shortfall in tax revenue is certainly a direct loss to the Chinese government, but from this, it can also be seen to what extent the commerce of various countries in China has been affected by Japanese militarism.</p>

<p>Municipal Chamber of Commerce Promotes Frugal Spring Wine to Aid Northeast</p>
<h3 id="e120">Tianchu Factory First Donates 1,000 Yuan <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, in order to promote saving spring wine expenses and transferring them to help Northeast refugees, and to express its gratitude to Tianchu Monosodium Glutamate Factory for taking the lead in implementing this, issued a public notice yesterday, stating that Mr. Wang Dongyuan is enthusiastic about national goods, and he and his comrades founded the Tianchu Monosodium Glutamate Factory, recovering countless profits that had flowed abroad. Recently, Mr. Wang, considering that the Northeast refugees are enduring hunger and cold, throwing their heads and fighting against the enemy for a single day's life, donated the factory's entire spring wine expense of 1,000 yuan for relief purposes. His friend, Mr. Zhang Lingyun, sympathizing with this move, also donated his entire spring wine expense of 400 yuan for Northeast refugee relief. This is truly a model for saving the country and spreading righteous voices in Shanghai. The Chamber of Commerce deeply admires this move. Shanghai's residents are densely populated, and it is a hub of commerce. It is the best in the country in terms of kindness and public service. At a time when national crisis is becoming increasingly serious, saving the three provinces is saving ourselves. It is hoped that people of insight and benevolence from all walks of life will follow suit, saving on food and drink expenses for the purpose of saving the nation. Don't let the two gentlemen monopolize the beauty in front, this is our earnest hope.</p>
<h3 id="e121">Jiangsu Construction Department Sends Personnel to Inspect and Accept Songtai Bao Engineering <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Construction Department, considering that the pond engineering in Songjiang Huating and the engineering in Taicang Chuansha and other places have been completed successively, sent Zhang Junsheng on the 15th to Songjiang to inspect and accept the engineering together with Xu Baikui, the director of the engineering office there. The length is about 30 zhang, and the cost is more than 6,000 yuan. On the 16th, he went to Taicang again to inspect and accept the Jingtang Bridge engineering together with Yin Xijue, the director of the engineering office there. Yesterday, he went to Baoshan again, together with Long Kaijia, the director of the pond engineering office there, to supervise the bidding for the Dama Bridge engineering in Beichuansha. The bid price was 2,700 yuan, and the bidders were Zhao Jinji and Xifuchang. The department will then select one of the two. Mr. Zhang has completed his official business and returned to the town last night.</p>
<h3 id="e122">No Definite Date for Collecting Business Tax <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>The business tax in this city has been delayed and has not yet been collected. This is because the authorities in this city, in view of the significant losses suffered by merchants in the Nanshi Zhabei area during the January 28th incident, have not fully recovered, and are mindful of the people's difficulties, and have had to temporarily postpone it. Moreover, merchants in the concessions have not implemented it either. If it is necessary to collect it, it should be done at the same time to ensure fairness. However, according to the concession authorities, according to the Yangjingbang Regulations, no local taxes may be collected in the concession in addition to national taxes. Although the municipal government has repeatedly sent personnel to negotiate, it is still in progress, so there is no definite date for the collection of business tax in this city.</p>
<p>Pengpu Villagers' General Meeting Firmly Opposes Land Grabbing Plan</p>
<h3 id="e123">Petition to the Executive Yuan to Order Reconsideration, Send Representatives to the Chamber of Commerce to Petition <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the case of railway merchants grabbing land in Pengpu to build a new station on Erlu Road, the villagers of Wangjiajing, Zhaojia Garden, and Zhuxiang in that area have repeatedly appealed to various authorities to avoid the area. The four ministries of Interior, Military Affairs, Industry, and Railways convened a meeting to discuss the solution. As a result, the original plan of the Ministry of Railways will still be carried out. The villagers there, considering that the authorities do not care about the people's suffering, convened a general meeting of all villagers yesterday morning. The following resolutions were passed: 1. Petition the Executive Yuan to order the four ministries of Interior, Military Affairs, Railways, and Industry to reconsider. 2. Petition the Control Yuan to thoroughly investigate whether the content of the resolution in this case is fair. 3. Petition the Ministry of Railways to reply in detail to the various points listed by the villagers earlier. 4. Send letters to all sectors to provide assistance. 5. Vow to fight to the death and never retreat before a satisfactory reply with sufficient reasons is obtained from the authorities on the various points mentioned above. Yesterday afternoon, representatives Tao Zhigang, Zhao Youting, etc. were also sent to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to petition for assistance.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance Approves that Machine-Made Goods of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce are Still Exempt from Tax</p>
<h3 id="e124">Treated the Same as Native Goods <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce previously stated that imitation foreign soap, although reported to the regular customs after cutting the Likin tax, was not taxed. Now, goods that have been approved for machine-made treatment must be released after paying tax, which is really biased. It telegraphed the Ministry of Finance to order that they be exempted from tax together. The Ministry of Finance has now approved the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, stating that machine-made goods are still exempt from tax. The original text says: "The telegram has been noted. It has been found that regular customs in various places have been abolished. The regular customs mentioned in the telegram should refer to the Wusong Customs sub-card that has been re-established. In addition to ordering the General Inspectorate of Customs to investigate and reply, and verifying that machine-made goods transported domestically by sailboat or carriage that have not been taxed by the customs before, the customs should still exempt them from tax, so as to treat them the same as native goods to relieve manufacturers. This approval is for your information."</p>

<p>In order to facilitate tourists traveling to Beijing and Hangzhou, the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administrations plan to add two types of round-trip tourist tickets for the Beijing-Hangzhou first and second class special express trains. The Ministry of Railways has approved the plan. It is said that the ticket price will be 75% of the original round-trip price. The first class is 30.2 yuan, and the second class is 19.2 yuan.

There are about 2,500 Japanese naval marines stationed in Shanghai, and about 100 Japanese police officers. As for the number of officers and men on Japanese warships, there is no definite number because they come and go frequently. The average number in Shanghai is about 500.</p>
<p>Products Participating in the Chicago Exposition Will Be Exhibited in Shanghai in Advance</p>

<p>The Preparatory Committee for the Ministry of Industry's participation in the Chicago Century of Progress Exposition has collected items from various places for transportation to the United States to participate. As of recently, items from various provinces have been successively transported to Shanghai. Among them, there are many famous and valuable items, especially the more than 1,000 pieces of porcelain from Jiangxi and the more than 500 pieces of special products from Beiping. The committee has decided to hold an exhibition in Shanghai before the items are shipped out. It has now been determined that the exhibition will be held at the Academia Sinica opposite the Zhaofeng Park on Avenue Petain from February 4th to 19th. Admission tickets are divided into long-term and ordinary types. The long-term fee is one yuan, and the ordinary fee is two jiao.

Yesterday, in order to attract the attention of the Chinese people, the Preparatory Committee sent a letter to the Central Broadcasting Station, requesting it to report the news every day.</p>
<p>Citizens on Nanjing Road Sent a Letter to the Taxpayers Association Yesterday Opposing the Municipal Council's Increase in House Tax</p>
<h3 id="e128">Estimating High Rents Causes Social Unrest <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>The Nanjing Road Business Federation and the First District Branch of the Citizens Association, considering that the member stores Yiletian and Tongyuchun, etc., were forcibly assessed high rents and charged additional donations by the Municipal Council, sent a letter to the Taxpayers Association yesterday requesting it to forward the letter to the council to cancel the additional charges in order to alleviate the merchants' difficulties. The original letter said: "We are writing to you directly. The case of our member stores, Yiletian Teahouse at No. 513 Nanjing Road, and its affiliated Tongyuchun Teahouse at No. 463 Nanjing Road, received notices from the Municipal Council on December 23rd of last year, stating that Yiletian Teahouse, which pays 4,000 yuan in house tax annually, must be increased to 9,240 yuan per year from April 1st of this year. In addition, our affiliated Tongyuchun, which pays 4,400 yuan per year, must be increased to 6,240 yuan, which is more than one-half and one-third more than the original amount. However, after investigation, our company and affiliated company have been operating on Nanjing Road for more than ten years. As a rule, the donation is based on the original amount of the rent. Now the Municipal Council wants to forcibly estimate the price, treating the rent of old houses as the expensive rent of newly renovated houses, which is unfair. Moreover, our company's business is light and the profit is small, and it is barely maintained by using copper coins. Since 1928, the business has plummeted. If additional donations are added for no reason, it will be even more difficult to bear. We sincerely request your association to forward a letter to the Municipal Council to understand the merchants' difficulties and still collect donations according to the old amount, and also request the Citizens General Association and the Chinese Taxpayers Association to provide assistance together, etc. Upon approval, it has been found that the amount of house tax is based on the original amount of rent, which is an immutable principle. If the Municipal Council wants to increase revenue, it forcibly estimates high rents in order to charge additional donations, which is directly tyrannical and oppresses the people. It is heard that this is to encourage landlords to increase rents, and the underlying motive is to make the society increasingly unstable. This is a violation of the Municipal Council's duty to maintain public security. From the standpoint of taxpayers, not only is it difficult for stores whose business is barely maintained to bear the additional donations, but we also oppose the Municipal Council's move to estimate prices and collect donations. Even stores with flourishing businesses cannot recognize the tyrannical policy of estimating prices and collecting donations in the state of paying donations in accordance with the law. Approving the reason for the letter, we hereby request your association to forward a letter to the Municipal Council, stating that the house tax of Yiletian and Tongyuchun should always be collected according to the original amount, and stop similar administrative actions from being applied to any taxpayers, in order to maintain social stability and benefit the citizens' happy lives. To the extent of the public friendship, this is to the Chinese Taxpayers Association."</p>

<h3 id="e132">China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Restructures Jianghai Shipping <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>Since Liu Hongsheng took over the reorganization of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, it has been several months. The internal organization has gradually been put in order. Now, they are starting to innovate and reorganize the business and ships. The reporter has investigated and reported the latest situation as follows:</p>
<p>Investigation of Yangtze River Freight Rates: The Yangtze River route is the main artery of the company's shipping business. Currently, the Jiang'an, Jiangxin, Jiangshun, Jianghua, Jiangda, Jiangjing, Jiangtian, Jianguo, Jiangyu, and Emei vessels operate. They are divided into two classes, A and B. For example, the Jiang'an, Jianghua, Jiangshun, and Jiangbei vessels are Class A ships, running on Mondays and Thursdays. The other vessels run on Tuesdays and Fridays. If the company can effectively reorganize the Yangtze River business, it can compete with Butterfield &amp; Swire and Jardine Matheson. President Liu has started by focusing on the Yangtze River. He has discussed with the Head of the Business Department, He Molin, and the Head of the Shipping Department, Zhao Yuntai, and others to standardize the Yangtze River freight rates to gain the trust of customers.</p>
<p>The two departments of business and shipping have been specially ordered to send commissioners to organize a water freight investigation committee to thoroughly investigate the actual situation in various ports upstream and downstream in order to verify and set standard freight rates.</p>
<p>Request to Build Steamers and Tugs: On the Yangtze River route, Butterfield &amp; Swire, Jardine Matheson, and others have selected and replaced new ships in recent years, but the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company still uses old ships. Some of the older ships are over 30 years old, with low speed and high coal consumption. The productivity is minimal, and the cost is twice that of foreign ships, which is not cost-effective. Therefore, Zhao Yuntai, the Head of the Shipping Department, has specially requested President Liu to continue to add new Yangtze River steamers under 3,000 tons, four Yangtze River steamers of 1,000 tons, two upper Yangtze River steamers of 500 tons, and 15 iron barges and self-propelled barges to be distributed within the Yangtze River to meet the needs. Moreover, it is stipulated that the old Yangtze River steamers will be allocated to government-rented transport ships. The Class A ships can only be used for commercial purposes and cannot be transferred for use to avoid delays and cause distrust among customers.</p>
<p>South China Stipulates Schedules: Last year, the entire fleet of ships was affected by the current situation, but the South China shipping routes flourished instead. For example, Butterfield &amp; Swire, Jardine Matheson, and other companies lost money on all routes last year, but the Shantou-Xiamen-Hong Kong lines of the South China route were fully loaded each time and made huge profits. The South China shipping routes of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company have always been the fundamental routes for coastal shipping. In recent years, since the accidents of Xinhua and Xinchang, there has not been a single ship that meets the regulations for sailing to Hong Kong. Although there is one ship, Gongping, it can only carry cargo and cannot transport passengers to Hong Kong. Now, the Shipping Department plans to first request the company to lease three ocean-going ships to operate in South China to develop business and restore the long-suspended Hong Kong liner. At the same time, they will request to build three new ocean-going ships of 3,000 tons to allow the South China line to have six ships operating, with the Shantou-Hong Kong-Guangdong line running on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, and the Xiamen-Hong Kong-Guangdong line running on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays, in order to gradually compete and recover the freight lost to foreign ships.</p>
<p>Xu Etang, Manager of Tian Qing Xiang, Commits Suicide</p>
<h3 id="e133">Commits Suicide by Poison Due to Poor Business, Leaving a Will to Purchase a Coffin and Clothes with 50 Gold Pieces <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>Xu Etang, also known as Tang, a 54-year-old Ningbo native and manager of Da Qing Xiang Leather Goods Store at 384 Henan Road, Public Concession, was known for his shrewd planning and capable work. He had been working at the store for six years and had annual surpluses, which the store owner greatly valued. Since the impact of the January 28 Incident last year, the leather business has plummeted, and inventory is piling up like mountains while new goods continue to arrive to maintain appearances. Recently, with the Lunar New Year approaching, finances have become tight, and turnover is difficult. Various accounts cannot be paid. Xu, with his upright nature, felt ashamed to ask the store owner for funds due to the poor business and huge expenses. In a moment of anger, he considered suicide. He went out around 4:00 PM the day before and returned to the store around 7:00 PM in the evening, having purchased strong opium. After dinner, he went upstairs to bed. At around 9:00 AM yesterday, he had not yet gotten up. His son entered the room to check on him and saw him lying stiffly on the bed, barely alive. He found an opium box and realized that he had committed suicide by taking poison. He was immediately taken to Renji Hospital for treatment, but due to the severe poisoning, he could not be saved and died shortly after. Beforehand, he had written a will, with the envelope addressed to Xu Etang's message, stating that purchasing a medium-quality coffin and clothes would cost 50 yuan, which would be enough. He also wrote that he was too ashamed to face anyone due to his sudden death, in a few words of extreme sorrow. According to various investigations by reporters, Xu's suicide was only due to a shortage of over 10,000 gold pieces, which is also pitiful.</p>

(Resolution) The number of people required to form a medical association will be based on the second article of the Shanghai Medical Association's previous draft opinions on the Ministry of Health's regulations for medical associations (original text: the number of doctors should be at least ten or more, which is certainly appropriate, but considering that there are very few doctors nationwide, it is easy for each city and county to reach five people, but in order to establish medical associations, it seems necessary to temporarily reduce the basic number of people to five).</p>

<p>The Host Receives an Intimidation Letter and Ignores It</p>
<p>The Cook Goes to the Appointment to Investigate</p>
<p>Three Kidnappers Actually Take Him Away</p>
<p>The Orderly Urgently Returns Home to Report</p>
<p>Feng Guoying, styled Songqing, is a native of Fujian, 43 years old, residing at 21 Rue Sainte Marie, French Concession. He formerly served as the section chief of the second section of the Military Commission's Management Department of the National Government. He recently retired last month. At about 3:00 PM yesterday, when Feng was about to take a car to Nanjing, he suddenly received an anonymous letter stating that due to extreme financial need, Feng was being asked to pay a ransom of 50,000 yuan, limited to 8:00 PM last night at the Oriental Hotel bookstore at the intersection of Xizang Road and Guangdong Road. It was also specified that the money should be handed over to someone in the bookstore wearing a suit and holding a bundle of newspapers. Feng simply laughed it off at the time and set off with his luggage. Unexpectedly, Feng's cook, Liu Yinquan (25 years old) from Henan, found out about the matter. Liu, being very curious, privately agreed with Feng's orderly to go with him at the appointed time. After arriving at the entrance of the Oriental Hotel, Liu instructed the orderly to watch from across the street. He then went straight into the bookstore. He saw two people wearing suits, one holding a bundle of newspapers, and one wearing a long gown waiting at the entrance of the bookstore. Liu immediately went forward to speak with them. Unexpectedly, when these three people saw that Liu did not mention the ransom, they immediately grabbed Liu and took him out of the Oriental Hotel, pushed him into a car at the entrance, and drove away quickly. At that time, the orderly who was waiting across the street saw Liu being kidnapped into the car and, knowing that it was difficult to call for help, frantically ran back home to report. After deliberation by Feng's wife and Feng's younger brother, they urgently reported the matter to the police station for investigation. The police station immediately dispatched a large number of detectives to search around the clock. It is reported that there are already clues.</p>

<p>The Shanghai YWCA has always been very willing to do its best for patriotic mutual assistance and obligations. Now, upon learning of the plight of refugees in the Yuguan area, who are suffering from the cold without food or clothing, and are displaced, the Association is deeply saddened and ashamed that it is unable to help them. Recently, they received a telegram from the Beijing YWCA asking them to donate money and clothing to be forwarded to the local relief efforts. The Association is urgently conducting a donation drive. In addition to starting with members of the Association, it is hoped that patriotic ladies will voluntarily contribute and send donations to the new premises of the Association at 8 Yuanmingyuan Road, C, 3rd Floor (telephone 13322). At this time of national crisis, it is believed that there are still many people who sympathize with the Association. For this kind of public service that is easy to accomplish, everyone will certainly do their best.</p>

<p>The case of Ling Jiannan, a native of Chuansha, who was killed by expelled detective Wang Wencai and others in Ximen Ningkang Lane, was heard yesterday by Judge Qian of the District Court. Chen Tugen, who had been in custody, was brought to court. Chen Tugen was a fugitive from the detention center who had been recaptured. Judge Qian immediately interrogated Chen Tugen about the circumstances of Ling Jiannan's death. However, Chen Tugen stubbornly denied everything. The Judge then asked Chen if he knew Wang Daxin and Huang Zicheng, etc. Chen replied that he did not know them. The Judge then asked Huang Zicheng. Huang claimed that he did not hide Wang Wencai, etc., and that he did not know them either. As for the first summons from the court, the name on the summons was Wang Datian, but my name is Huang Zicheng, so I wrote a name on the bailiff's statement and could not appear in court. The second summons corrected the name, and I went to Hankou. Because I wrote my own name, they knew that I was Huang Zicheng, so I was falsely accused. Huang Shaoying testified that he did not know how Wang Wencai, etc., went to kill people, and that he was not at home. The court also summoned the police officer on duty that day to testify that after Ling Jiannan was injured, his wife shouted to catch the thief, and I apprehended Chen Tugen. Chen said that he was not a thief, but was in a fight. At that time, Chen had no weapon in his hand, and I did not see Huang Zicheng and Huang Shaoying. The Judge, considering that the case still required further investigation, ordered Chen Tugen to be detained and the others to return home to await instructions.</p>

<p>The Shanghai National Goods Factory Association held a public banquet for Mr. Xue Dubi last night, and invited Mr. He Zhuoxian, Director of the Trademark Bureau of the Ministry of Industry, to attend. Standing Committee member Lu Xingzhuang reported on Mr. Xue's assistance when he was Minister of Interior during the National Goods Exhibition held by the Association in the capital. Mr. Xue then delivered a speech, saying that although he had only provided a small help at the time, he was unduly praised, and he felt ashamed. Promoting national goods, under the leadership of the government, would be more effective and efficient. Therefore, he had a plan at the time, which had been approved by the Central Political Council, but was not implemented due to the unstable political situation. Now that he has resigned from the National Government Committee and come to Shanghai to practice law, he will follow in the footsteps of everyone in promoting national goods and do his best. He will not accept consultant fees from national goods companies to help them.</p>

<p>| These Shameless Men and Women Should Be Severely Punished |</p>
<p>Li Xu, a woman from Yancheng, is in her early twenties, beautiful, and somewhat flirtatious. She lives at No. 5 Yude Lane, Lan Ni Du, Pudong. Her husband, Li Xianggui, is 24 years old, from Yangzhou, and works as a foot masseur at the Xiquanzi Bathhouse at No. 100 Rue de Pruy, French Concession. The couple's relationship is not good. He stays in Shanghai and rarely returns home. Unable to bear her loneliness, Li Xu came to Shanghai from Pudong on the 20th of last month and went to the New World Amusement Park. By chance, she met her maternal uncle, Li Zhaoxing, a 41-year-old man from Yangzhou. After inquiring about her reasons for leaving home, Li, although over forty, is a lecherous man, working as a foreman somewhere. He is a vulgar man who knows nothing about propriety, justice, or shame. Seeing that his nephew's wife is beautiful,</p>
<p>He Forgets His Place and Takes Her to A Relative's Place to Have Bestial Relations. On the first of this month, he rented a room in the back building at No. 25 Qinyu Lane, Yangshupu Road, and cohabited with her, living like a couple. Li Li, the woman's mother-in-law, had been searching everywhere for her daughter-in-law since she disappeared, but could not find her. She entrusted people to search everywhere, but there was no news. She sobbed and wept all day long, extremely anxious, and dared not tell her son, fearing that it would cause him trouble, hoping that his daughter-in-law would return soon to avoid problems. Until recently, someone reported</p>
<p>The Location of Her Hideout. She Came to Shanghai Overnight and Rushed to Her Son's, Li Xianggui's, Place, and Told Him the Situation. Li Xianggui, Learning That His Wife Was Having An Affair, Could Not Believe That It Was Actually His Mother's Brother. Therefore, He Invited Many Friends and Hired Two Cars. Together With His Mother, Li Li, at 5:00 AM the Previous Morning, He Went to Capture the Adulterers. When They Arrived, The Front Door Was Already Closed. They Went Straight Upstairs and Found the Back Door Tightly Closed. They Broke Down the Door and Entered. Unexpectedly, Li Xu and Her Maternal Uncle, Li Zhaogui, Were</p>
<p>Sound Asleep, Embracing Each Other, Right in the Middle of A Wonderful Dream. Li Xianggui, Seeing That the Adulterer Was His Maternal Uncle, Became Even More Furious. He Rushed Forward and Pulled Off the Quilt, Seeing That They Were Both Stark Naked. They Woke Up From Their Dream, Undressed. Li Li then Helped Her Daughter-In-Law Put On Her Clothes. Li Xianggui Then Grabbed His Maternal Uncle and Slapped Him Violently, Dragging Him Downstairs and Making A Scene at the Entrance. Fortunately, Detectives Wang Jinsheng, Liu Changgen, and Third Head Constable Hu Wenfu Arrived and Inquired About the Situation. They Took Li Zhaoxing, Li Xianggui, and the Woman Li Xu to the Yangshu Police Station. Li Zhaoxing Alleged That His Nephew Li Xianggui Had Seized the Opportunity to Steal His Watch Worth Twelve Yuan. The Detectives Found the Watch on Li Xianggui. The Head Constable Ordered Them to Be Detained Separately. Yesterday Morning, They Were Sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. The Police Barrister Zhang Tianyin Detailed The Course of Events and Stated That The Police Were Filing Charges in Accordance with Article 245 of the Criminal Law</p>
<p>For Incestuous Adultery. The First Defendant Is Li Zhaoxing, The Second Defendant Is Li Xu, And The Third Defendant Is Li Xianggui, Who Is Being Prosecuted For Theft Under Article 337 of the Criminal Law. However, He Claimed at The Police Station That He Had Found The Watch on The Ground at The Time and Did Not Steal It, So He Presented The Watch For Inspection. Li Li Also Claimed That Li Xianggui and Li Xu Were Her Son and Daughter-In-Law, And That The Defendant Li Zhaoxing Was Her Cousin Within The Fifth Degree of Kinship. Last Spring, When I Met Him in Our Hometown, He Told Me That My Son Xianggui Was Often Working in The Bathhouse in The French Concession, And That His Wife Xu Was Young and Naive, So He Asked Him to Take Care of Her. Unexpectedly, He Had An Affair With His Nephew's Wife, And Described The Circumstances of Going to Catch The Adulterers. Wu Guibao Also Claimed That He Was The Second Landlord at No. 25 Qinyu Lane, Yangshupu Road. Li Xu Came to Rent The Room in The Back Building From Me on The First of This Month. In The Evening, The Defendant Li Zhaoxing Slept With Her. I Have No Idea If They Are</p>
<p>Husband and Wife. Until Yesterday, They Did Not Leave. When The Adulterers Were Caught, I Was Still in Bed. After This Incident Was Discovered, I Saw Two Cars Parked at The Door. In The Past, There Was Only One Bed in Their Room. Fu Zhengru Testified That He Was a Colleague of Li Xianggui at The Xiquanzi Bathhouse. At The Time, Li Xianggui Invited Me to Go and Catch The Adulterers. I Saw Li Zhaoxing and Li Xu Sleeping on The Same Bed. It Was True That His Mother Li Li Dragged His Daughter-In-Law Out of The Bed. Li Zhaoxing Testified That He Met Li Xu Before at a Certain Place and That She Was Not His Nephew's Wife. On The Evening of The 29th of Last Month, He Met Her at The New World Amusement Park. She Said That Her Husband Li Xianggui Was Working in The Bathhouse and Had Not Returned Home For a Long Time, Nor Had He Sent Any Money Home. She Was Now</p>
<p>Lacking Food and Clothing and Finding It Difficult to Survive. I Told Her to Go Home, But She Refused. He Denied That He Rented The House in Qinyu Lane and Did Not Sleep With Her, And That Li Xianggui Was Not His Nephew. The Court Verified The Testimony. As This Case Has Been Detailed by Various Witnesses, There Was No Room For Denial. He Was Ordered to Confess The Truth and Then Admitted to Having an Affair With Xu, But That She Was Not His Nephew's Wife, Please Judge. Li Xu, With a Bobbed Haircut and Flashy Dress, Wearing a Fuzzy Short Shirt, Black and Green Collar, Pink Silk Cotton Pants, Stockings, and Satin Shoes,</p>
<p>Was Frivolous. Her Eyes Were Charming. She Testified That Because Her Husband Li Xianggui Had Not Been Home For a Long Time and She Had No Money to Spend, She Secretly Came to Shanghai and Met Li Zhaoxing at The New World, And Then Had an Affair With Him. He Was Not Her Maternal Uncle. The Remaining Testimony Was Evasive. Li Xianggui Testified That Li Zhaoxing Was Indeed His Maternal Uncle, And Briefly Described The Course of Events of Catching The Adulterers. As For The Watch, He Had Found It on The Ground. Judge Zhao Linyu Verified The Testimony, Ordered The Lawyers For Both Parties to Begin The Debate, and Ordered Li Zhaoxing and Li Xu to Be Detained Separately. Li Xianggui Was Released on Bail and Ordered to Report Whenever Summoned Awaiting a Set Date For Sentencing.</p>

<p>Japanese Navy Third Fleet Staff Officer Lieutenant Commander Fukuda Isamu, a strong proponent of Sino-Japanese friendship, died of acute pneumonia while serving in Shanghai. At 2:00 PM yesterday, Commander Minai of the Third Fleet held a naval funeral ceremony for Fukuda's body. Chief of Staff Kikuno of the same fleet was appointed as the director of the sea burial, with staff officer Okuma, Marine Corps staff officer Sakai, naval attaché Kobetto, and Marine Corps chief of staff Kawamura as committee members. Minai ordered all officers of all ranks from the Izumo, Tenryu, Hishi, Ashi, and Tung warships stationed in Shanghai to participate, and dispatched a company of marines, a military band, a company of military police, and a squad of Japanese police from the consulate to gather in front of the Zhaizhang set up at the Hongkou Marine Corps headquarters.

The entire honor guard of the Izumo warship participated. Minai also ordered all Japanese warships in Shanghai to fly half-mast in mourning. On the Chinese side, Tang Mang, Wang Qingchen, Chen Zemin, and others all went to express their condolences. Xiao Baixin even offered condolences with the lines "His noble spirit filled the heavens, his great ambitions were not fulfilled, the general star fell on the sea, and tears flowed on the guest journey." Fukuda had served in China as the captain of the Yangtze River gunboats Sumida and Atami for a long time and was a strong advocate of Sino-Japanese friendship.</p>
<p>Freight Forwarding and Customs Declaration Industry Hosts Banquet for Customs Officials</p>
<h3 id="e148">Tax Affairs Director's Understanding of Merchants' Difficulties <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai City Forwarding and Customs Clearance Association, representing all its members, has been facing immense difficulties since the Jianghai Customs implemented its new regulations last year. The regulations require members to pay exorbitant security deposits and impose various harsh treatments, making it practically unbearable for the customs clearance industry. The association had previously submitted a petition to the Director-General of Customs and the Finance and Customs Affairs Department, requesting the cancellation of the new regulations to alleviate the merchants' plight. However, the outcome was nearly zero, and the Customs continued its severe penalties. Consequently, the Chairman of the Association, Shi Zhikun, You Senting, and others, specially sought the assistance of shipping magnates to explain their hardships in detail to Director Luo.</p>
<p>Director Luo showed understanding. Last night, at 6:30 PM, the association held a Western-style banquet on the fourth floor of the Shipping Club at 10 Guangdong Road. Guests included Director Luo, Customs Directors Ford and others, as well as shipping leaders Liu Hongsheng (China Merchants), Yu Qiaqing (Sanbei), Yang Nanmei (Butterfield &amp; Swire), Jardine Matheson representatives Lawyer, George White, Tate, Lin Yongxiang (Jardine), Yuan Ludeng (Ning Shao). The customs clearance industry's Chairman Shi Zhikun, Zhou Jingzhai, You Senting, and Zheng Renye warmly welcomed the guests. Halfway through the banquet, Chairman Shi Zhikun rose to deliver a speech, briefly stating that the past misunderstandings between the Customs and the industry had now been resolved through Director Luo's understanding. Regarding the security deposit required by the new regulations, the association had already raised 100,000 yuan to deposit in the Central Bank as the industry's security deposit. Director Luo was also well aware that the customs clearance industry was not without assets. As for the various harsh penalties imposed by the Customs, Director Luo had agreed to consider them. However, he mentioned the complexity of the industry's members and the frequent disturbances caused at the Customs, hoping for rectification. It had been decided with Director Luo that in the future, Customs would give priority to customs brokerage firms joining the association, and sternly eliminate and eradicate unlicensed brokers. He earnestly hoped that the staff and apprentices sent by the industry to the Customs would strictly abide by Customs regulations to maintain their personal integrity and status. Director Luo also rose to give a brief response, stating that he was very pleased to gather for dinner and that it was not appropriate to discuss official matters. However, the various difficulties of the customs clearance industry had been fully understood after Chairman Shi's statement, and the treatment of the industry would certainly be improved in the future. The banquet then concluded.</p>
<h3 id="e149">Patriotic Donations from Zhengtai Factory Workers <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>The Zhengtai Rubber Factory in this city, a Chinese-owned enterprise, boasts a large scale. Its "Great Happiness" and "Evergreen" brand rubber products are of excellent quality, affordable, and durable, sold throughout the country. The factory workers have always been deeply patriotic. Recognizing that the Northeast Volunteer Army is fighting heroically against Japan, defending the nation, all compatriots should provide assistance to the best of their ability. In addition to donating over 400 yuan from a previous banquet to the support association last year, employees of the factory's second plant, including Shen Bailin, Huang Shouyuan, Ji Hongbiao, and Ji Duanzhong, initiated an age-based donation (i.e., one copper coin for each year of age). All factory workers, regardless of gender, enthusiastically contributed, with some making special donations ranging from one to ten yuan. Sixty yuan in silver and over 120,000 copper coins were collected on the spot. Yesterday, when the donation box was opened, everyone unanimously agreed to donate the entire amount to the Northeast Volunteer Army fighting in the frozen wasteland. The factory workers' repeated donations are truly commendable. It is hoped that more Chinese compatriots will act likewise, so that the country will still have hope.</p>

<p>Tea and Snack Workers of Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway Petitioned Party and Government Organs Yesterday</p>
<h3 id="e151">Also Telegraphing the People's Movement Association and the Ministry of Railways Requesting Cessation of Bureau's Bidding <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>Due to the Railway Bureau's bidding for the tea and snack services, causing panic among the tea and snack workers of the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway, they sent representatives to petition the two Bureau Directors, Huang Boqiao, the day before yesterday, but without result. Therefore, at 10 AM yesterday morning, they dispatched representatives to petition the Municipal Government with a written statement. Secretary Wang Shaozhai received them and stated that since the matter concerned labor-capital disputes, he would transfer it to the Social Affairs Bureau for handling according to the law. They then proceeded to petition the Municipal Party Department, where the Chief Director of the People's Training Section, Zhang Sheng, received them and promised to submit a request for approval. The workers issued a declaration yesterday and telegraphed the Central People's Training Association and the Ministry of Railways, requesting the cessation of the Bureau's bidding, and planned to send representatives to Nanjing and Beijing. The original telegram and declaration are recorded below.</p>
<p>Telegraph: Nanjing Central People's Movement Guidance Committee, Railways Ministry, esteemed sirs. This time, the Bureau suddenly, during the effective period of the renewed contract for the tea and snack services on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway, rashly posted a public tender for contracting, causing extremely serious repercussions. Evidence was collected and mailed on the removed date, requesting investigation and handling. Despite repeated petitions, the Party Department of the Bureau has shown no signs of assistance. However, the Bureau has decided to implement the bidding on removed date, and the lives of hundreds of workers will inevitably be sacrificed as a result. The bidding period is secret, the situation is tense, and an unprecedented catastrophe is imminent. We urgently request an immediate telegram to the Bureau to stop the bidding. To avoid expansion, this is the only way. Anxious and urgent telegram, awaiting orders. The Shanghai-Hangzhou Section Tea and Snack Workers Anti-Subcontracting Movement Executive Committee, General Director Sun Wenpin, Deputy General Directors Zhou Panlin, Lu Yisheng, jointly kowtow.</p>
<p>Declaration: Investigation reveals that the Bureau uses the subcontracting system to oppress workers, and the most prominent in this harmful relationship are the subcontractors of tea, snacks, catering, and loading/unloading, who apply their oppressive tactics to the greatest extent. The events of the past make us believe it even more. However, the rise and fall of the subcontracting system are closely related to the vital interests of the workers. At this time of thoroughly eradicating the subcontracting trend, there is indeed a dilemma. Therefore, the workers of tea, snacks, catering, loading, and unloading groups recognize this as a matter of life and death, and it is essential to abolish subcontracting and operate independently. Thus, they rose one after another to launch the anti-subcontracting movement, finally achieving the goal of the Bureau abolishing subcontractors and the workers directly undertaking the services. Proof of this can be found in August of the 17th year of the Republic, when the Bureau revoked the contract signed with subcontractor Yao Xigeng for the Jing-Hu dining car service and returned it to the workers to undertake. At that time, the Shanghai-Hangzhou tea and snack workers were still under the control of subcontractor Xu Huisheng, enduring unbearable oppression. They launched another anti-subcontracting movement, and finally, in May of the 18th year of the Republic, representatives were commissioned by various higher-level organizations to supervise the signing of labor-capital reconciliation conditions, guaranteeing that the workers would no longer be subjected to subcontractor oppression. When the subcontractor's contract expired, the Bureau would grant the tea and snack workers the priority right to undertake the services directly. This was the main regulation for resolving the dispute. Therefore, in July of the 10th year of the Republic, the Bureau, based on the priority right, signed the first direct contract with the workers to undertake the tea and snack services, for a term of one year. The second renewal of the new contract was also officially signed by both parties on September 19th of the 21st year of the Republic, and the security deposit was fully paid, with complete procedures and a solid foundation. Even if the contract expired, it should still be renewed according to precedent. However, during the legally effective period, not only was the new contract withheld and not issued, becoming ironclad evidence of intentional breach of faith, but also a public tender was announced, further revealing the contradiction of their behavior, using the deceitful tactic of deceiving themselves to destroy legal rights. How should we emphasize the importance of maintaining the livelihood of the workers? Would we rather restore subcontracting and allow them to poison the people? The absurdity of reason has reached this extreme. Our Association is determined to unite and resist insults, driven by justice to fight, grieving over the fickleness, expressing a solemn public opinion, and vowing not to give up until the bidding is abolished. We respectfully hope that enthusiastic organizations at home and abroad will rise up to support us, so that justice can triumph over power. We beg the attention of all sectors. This declaration is respectfully submitted for your consideration. Shanghai-Hangzhou Section Tea and Snack Workers Anti-Subcontracting Movement Executive Committee respectfully.</p>
<h3 id="e152">A Difficult Situation for the Lawyer's Secretary in a Smuggling Case Where the Bail Money is Confiscated <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>Zheng Qiaji's tobacco firm, for the sake of providing excellent service to its customers, would dispatch employees to deliver opium for purchases exceeding ten taels, in order to avoid any danger during transit. Xu Genlin and his wife, Wang, served as delivery personnel for several years, without any previous incidents. Unexpectedly, in November, Mr. Xu was transporting a large quantity of opium in a rented car to a location in the International Settlement, when he was apprehended and the opium confiscated. He was handed over to the First Special District Court for interrogation and punishment. His lawyer, Zhang Zongding, filed an appeal, and he was granted bail after posting a 2,000 yuan bond, pending further review. When the appellate court summoned him for questioning, Mr. and Mrs. Xu repeatedly failed to appear. Consequently, the appellate court rejected the appeal and ordered the confiscation of the 2,000 yuan bond. However, Mr. and Mrs. Xu did not realize that trafficking opium was illegal and punishable by law. Instead, they blamed their lawyer, Zhang Chongding, for ineffective defense. They went to Mr. Zhang's office, and, as he was unavailable, they tricked Mr. Zhang's secretary, Cheng Xinglin, into going to the Xu residence in the French Concession, claiming that Mr. Zhang had to compensate them for the confiscated 2,000 yuan bond and return the lawyer's fee before they would release him. After repeated negotiations between the parties, Cheng Xinglin finally regained his freedom. However, Cheng felt deeply humiliated by this ordeal, as he was not involved in the matter. Therefore, he argued with the Xus for a long time, but to no avail. Cheng has now filed a criminal complaint with the First Special District Court against Xu Wang, Xu Genlin's wife, for restricting his freedom. Since being released on bail in the opium case, she has evaded capture. Regarding Cheng's complaint,</p>
<p>she has also repeatedly failed to appear in court, and Judge Shen Bingrong continued the hearing yesterday morning. However, as the defendant Xu Wang was still unable to be summoned, the trial could not proceed and was adjourned to a later date.</p>
<h3 id="e153">The Dashing Thief in the Customs <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>| Confesses to the Ingenious Method of Pawning Typewriters |</p>
<p>In recent months, repeated thefts have occurred in the Jianghai Customs' main writing room and second-floor appraisal room. Numerous items of clothing, such as coats, fur robes, camel hair robes, and mandarin jackets, have been stolen. On the 19th and 28th of last month, two typewriters, one large and one small, were stolen from the appraisal room. The total losses amount to over a thousand yuan. The greatest victim was clerk Shi Cunqiao. The thief's usual attire was very dashing, and he moved in and out of the Customs freely, causing others not to pay attention to him. Unexpectedly, the thief went to the Customs again the day before yesterday to carry out his old trick, and was noticed and captured by clerk Shi. The Water Police Station was notified, and detectives Wu Rongsheng and Su Jinlong were dispatched to take the suspect back to the police station. Under interrogation, the suspect confessed his name was Lin Aquan, 23 years old, from Qingpu, without a fixed occupation, specializing in theft to make a living. He also said that his accomplices included Zhang Atao and others. When the police asked if he had committed thefts elsewhere, Lin confessed to stealing a typewriter from the window of the China and Foreign Telephone Company. He also stated that pawning a typewriter required a guarantor, so he came up with a method: he falsely claimed to the pawnshop that it was being pawned from a certain foreign barracks, and instructed the pawnshop clerk to accompany him to the gate of a certain foreign barracks. He first had the pawnshop clerk wait outside, and then he went inside to falsely claim he was looking for a friend, circled around, and came out again. He had previously written some Western characters with a black pen on a piece of foreign paper, which he gave to the clerk to take back as proof. Therefore, the pawnshop believed him and was willing to accept the pawn. After verifying his confession, the police dispatched detectives to the pawnshops he mentioned and redeemed a夹大衣, a camel hair robe, and three typewriters, which were returned to the victims. Yesterday, the police took the suspect to the Public Concession Police Station for further interrogation. It was discovered that he had also committed numerous other crimes. He was then taken back to the Water Police Station and detained pending transfer to the court for trial.</p>

<p>Wang Bin, a detective from the Songhu Garrison Headquarters, was assassinated by communist enemies on the afternoon of April 23rd of last year while riding in a rented car on Avenue Vilmont in the French Concession. His driver also suffered the same fate. Less than a month later, Cao Qingcheng, a Hubei native and inspector of the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau, who lived in Yuancheng Lane on Avenue Lafayette, was also assassinated on Avenue Kelle, and Jin Shoupei, a native of Jiangwan, was mistakenly killed because of mistaken identity. Detectives pursued the suspects to locations such as Rue Bayle, where they apprehended the murderers Liu Guobao, a Sichuan native (17 years old), and Li Shiying, a Henan native. They confiscated handguns. Later, they went to the residence of Liu and Li at 305 Weihaiwei Road and arrested another accomplice, Li Zecai from Anhui. They also went to 980 Huade Road and arrested suspect Zhu Jinming and others, confiscating handguns, bullets, bayonets, handcuffs, and other items. They were sent to the Jiangsu High Court Third Branch for prosecution. The case has been heard and is awaiting judgment, as reported previously. Yesterday afternoon at 2 PM, the police brought the defendants to court. The Criminal Court sentenced Liu Guobao and Li Shiying to ten years imprisonment each for forming an organization with the purpose of endangering the Republic of China and depriving them of their civil rights for fifteen years. They were each sentenced to death for premeditated murder and deprived of their civil rights for life. The death sentences will be carried out. Li Zecai was sentenced to ten years imprisonment for forming an organization with the purpose of endangering the Republic of China and deprived of his civil rights for fifteen years. He was sentenced to ten years imprisonment for conspiracy to commit murder and deprived of his civil rights for fifteen years. He will serve a total of nineteen years imprisonment and be deprived of his civil rights for fifteen years. The number of days of detention will be deducted from the prison sentence. Four handguns, 681 bullets, 19 bullet magazines, 4 bayonets, and 2 handcuffs will be confiscated. Liu Guobao, Li Shiying, and Li Zecai were found not guilty of the other charges against them. Zhu Jinming was found not guilty. After the judgment was read, the court explained the reasons for the judgment to each defendant. Liu and the two Lis were taken back into custody. Zhu Jinming had submitted a petition requesting bail, which the court granted upon finding a suitable guarantor for 1,000 yuan pending review. However, in this case, there was no evidence in the investigation regarding the murder of Wang Bin, so no conviction was made on that charge.</p>

Over sixty workers, including Gao Yongliu and Zheng Yongfa, attended. Gao Yongliu chaired the meeting. The chairman gave a report, and then discussions began regarding returning to work on the ship tomorrow (i.e., today). It was decided that the entire group would gather at the China Shipyard this morning and board the Wusong ship for resumption of work when it arrives at the port. However, if the company expels them again at that time, it is feared that a major disturbance may occur.</p>

<h3 id="e166">Can Personality Be Exchanged for Food? <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>丨Letter from Mr. Weng Chongshi丨</p>
<p>(Since Mr. Weng's first letter was published in this column on December 19th, Mr. Zhu Yingsun and Mr. Jingren have subsequently written, repeatedly discussing our reply. 丨See this column on December 19th, 22nd, 27th, and 31st丨 We have now received a follow-up letter from Mr. Weng, which we are publishing below, followed by our reply.)</p>
<p>The people demanding debts have been coming incessantly, all with cold and sarcastic remarks. My wife is narrow-minded and cannot bear such humiliation, so she is constantly complaining to me. She says things like, "A person cannot get rich without unexpected wealth!" and "Many students are selling Japanese goods and smuggling opium, and they are living so happily now! You insist on adhering to the three prohibitions (prostitution, gambling, and drinking) and on maintaining your personality. Now you are suffering like this! Can personality be exchanged for food?" Alas! Sir, is what my wife says correct? Indeed, many people were so enthusiastically patriotic when they were students, but why do they all change completely once they enter society and start working?</p>
<p>In this cold and indifferent world, besides you, the reporter, I didn't think there were still Mr. Zhu Ying and Mr. Sun Jingren who sympathize with me. I am truly grateful! I beg you to tell me their addresses! Also, on January 1st, in your reply to Mr. Sun Jingren, you said, "We further hope that everyone can have a thorough awakening..." The meaning of the word "awakening" is quite vague. Please explain the "steps" of awakening as much as possible!</p>
<p>Reply: Reading your letter naturally fills us with endless indignation! Your wife's words are extremely painful! Of course, everyone knows that what she said is wrong, but no one can produce facts to refute it. However, I must ask, can this current state of affairs continue? We want to tell your wife that this will certainly not last long! Our society is now falling into a deep abyss of decline. No wonder everything around us is pitch black. And some people who will soon "die peacefully in their beds" seem to feel that their heaven is experiencing violent tremors. At the same time, they do not understand what kind of world will exist after these violent tremors. In their minds, perhaps it will still be theirs. Therefore, enjoyment and indulgence dominate everything they do. In this brief moment, they doubly expose their "ugliness" and fully unleash their "beastly desires," wasting their last bit of destiny! To put it kindly, this is "a final burst of glory before death"; to put it badly, it is "hastening death"! Your wife only sees their enjoyment and not their dark side. She thinks they are still in heaven, but in fact, they will soon be "buried." This momentary enjoyment is merely the prelude to their death knell! Here, we must ask ourselves: are we willing to follow them into the grave? Or are we going to find our own path to light and create our own paradise? If you are willing to crawl into the grave with them, then by all means pursue momentary, shallow pleasures. Otherwise, we should endure our hardships! Poverty is not the end of everything—we believe that the word "poverty" will soon disappear from the dictionary. If a person is afraid of poverty, then he is finished. Of course, we must eat, but "wanting to eat" is definitely not the same as "being afraid of poverty." We must distinguish this clearly. Now, on the one hand, we must strive to develop "light," and on the other hand, we must push this "cold and indifferent world" to accelerate its destruction. This work may be arduous, but because it is arduous, we should make redoubled efforts! I hope that you and your wife can both understand this clearly. You also asked: what are the steps for awakening? Please reread my reply to Mr. Sun's original letter. It says: "Ask why most people suffer and cannot get enough to eat, or want to suffer but have no suffering to endure? Why do a few people not suffer at all and attain 'peace, wealth, and honor'?" If you can answer these questions, then you are awakened. There do not need to be any "steps" in this. As long as you can understand the origins of your "suffering," that is enough. As for how to deal with the incessant debt collectors, we have already said in our previous letter: repay if you can; if you can't, let them do what they want. If you simply ignore them, what can they do? Of course, if they can forgive your difficulties and discuss solutions with you politely, you should welcome that. Otherwise, you absolutely do not need to be afraid of them! You must also relax a little and absolutely do not worry. Even if you worry a lot, none of the debt collectors will forgive you.</p>
<p>(Mr. Weng hopes that we will tell him the contact addresses of Mr. Zhu Ying and Mr. Sun Jingren. Unfortunately, we do not even know the contact addresses of these two gentlemen. Here, we will introduce Mr. Weng to Mr. Zhu and Mr. Sun. Mr. Weng is currently the principal of the First Central Elementary School in Fuqing City, Fujian. If you two would like to correspond with him, please write directly to him. If you are willing to tell us your contact addresses, we would also be very happy.)</p>

<p>丨Zhu Jia骅 Expresses His Opinion丨</p>
<p>Only One Day Away from the Scheduled Winter Vacation</p>
<p>Therefore, There is No Need to Issue Another Order to Prevent It</p>
<p>(Nanjing 17th, Telegram) Zhu Jia骅 said that the Ministry of Education believes that universities in Beiping released students early for winter vacation because the national crisis is becoming increasingly urgent, and it is a time for young people to bury themselves in their studies.</p>
<p>Since it is only one day away from the scheduled winter vacation for universities on January 18th, there is no need to issue another order to prevent it. As for the citizens of Beiping who requested that the government allocate the educational funds for universities in Beiping during the suspension of classes to the anti-Japanese cause, the Ministry of Education has not yet received this request and has no opinion to express. However, university funding is determined by the government and should not be diverted casually, he said.</p>

<p>丨To be Announced in About a Week丨</p>
<p>Since the Legislative Yuan passed the Law on Secondary and Elementary Schools and the Ministry of Education announced it (previously named the Law on the Organization of Secondary Schools and the Law on the Organization of Elementary Schools, now the word "organization" has been removed, and named the Law on Secondary Schools and the Law on Elementary Schools, which is more concise than adding the word "organization"), the Ministry of Education immediately drafted the Regulations on Secondary and Elementary Schools based on the Law on Secondary and Elementary Schools passed by the Legislative Yuan (the law is a general outline, and the regulations are more detailed). The drafting of the Regulations on Elementary Schools has been completed, and the Minister of Education convened a departmental meeting on the 13th and 14th of this month with the secretaries, counselors, directors of the relevant departments, and related staff of the ministry to discuss it in detail. The Regulations on Elementary Schools have more than 70 articles, including considerable regulations and specific decisions on school administration and organization, the service and treatment of teachers and staff, the qualification of teachers, school holiday regulations, the examination of student performance, and curriculum equipment. All the articles have been generally approved and will be finalized after a final review. It is heard that the date of announcement will be in about a week.</p>

<p>Chen Burei Cautions Elementary School Teachers in Hangzhou</p>
<h3 id="e170">Make Up for Classes Missed Due to General Leave <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>Chen Burei, Director of the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Education, stated that the elementary school teachers in Hangzhou took a half-day of general leave on the 10th of this month to petition the government for funds. This placed their own problems above the students' studies, which had a significant impact on the elementary school students. Moreover, elementary education in Hangzhou has a considerable reputation in the national education system, and this incident was a stain on Hangzhou's education. Chen Burei was deeply saddened by this, so he ordered the municipal government to strictly caution the principals to prevent this bad phenomenon from happening again and affecting the students' perceptions. The municipal government has already notified the schools. It was found that the educational staff of the municipal elementary schools stopped classes for half a day to petition for the issuance of seniority pay, etc. This kind of action is regrettable because it interferes with the children's studies. In addition to ordering them not to repeat this in the future, they must make up for the missed classes before the end of this semester. This is an announcement.</p>

<h3 id="e174">The Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Education First Rectifies Municipal Schools <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>丨Director Pan Expresses His Political Views at the Memorial Week丨</p>
<p>Pan Gongzhan, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Education, gave a speech at the bureau's memorial week yesterday (the 16th), recorded by Wang Daxu. The speech is as follows:</p>
<p>The first semester of this year is now coming to an end. I feel that I have many thoughts on the middle and elementary schools in this city. Let me briefly state them.</p>
<p>Because the end of the semester means the end of a stage, the Bureau of Education evaluates the performance of each municipal school for a semester at this time. Often during this period, many principals of municipal schools are quite uneasy. At the same time, on the other hand, there are many who hope to obtain a suitable position to serve, and they are also actively seeking opportunities. Therefore, some strange phenomena inevitably occur. From the perspective of educational administration, because the semester is coming to an end, the Bureau of Education rectifies the municipal schools and implements rewards and punishments. The purpose is to promote education, and it is completely based on the results of the bureau's usual inspections. However, if the handling is slightly improper, it may even lead to abuses and cultivate a habit and a widespread mentality that one must contact the staff of the Bureau of Education in order to become a principal and maintain one's position. When abuses occur, it will inevitably lead to school principals being unable to concentrate on running the school and spending most of their time running to the door of the Bureau of Education, and only spending a very small amount of time dealing with school affairs. In this way, how can the school have good performance? Even within the school, upon hearing that the principal may be changed, the faculty and staff are inevitably affected, their work is slackened, and the impact on children's studies is not insignificant. This kind of concept is actually wrong. It must be known that the bureau's evaluation of the performance of each school is based entirely on whether the principal and faculty of each school can fulfill their duties. Those with excellent performance should naturally be allowed to continue in their positions. Those whose performance is not well-managed will definitely not be corrected or reassigned due to their diligence in running around or the favors of one or two people. Sacrificing the students' studies cannot be tolerated. Therefore, among the principals of municipal schools, there are many who work very hard and have excellent performance. As long as they maintain their spirit of hard work and keep working hard, the bureau will naturally provide them with possible assistance. There is absolutely no need to cause unnecessary panic and disturbance at the end of the semester or school year.</p>
<p>The bureau spends 80,000 to 90,000 yuan of municipal funds every month. What exactly is it doing? Leaving aside the social education aspect, as for the school education aspect, it is nothing more than managing municipal schools and supervising private schools. At present, there are many private schools in this city that are not well-managed and should be banned. However, there are also those that are indeed well-managed and have achievements. As far as my personal feelings are concerned, I feel that to supervise private schools, we should start by rectifying municipal schools. If municipal schools have good performance, we should strive for further progress to serve as an example for private schools. If we neglect municipal schools and only want to strictly supervise private schools, it is really unreasonable. Because if the performance of municipal schools is poor, they will not only be unable to supervise private schools, but also lose the credibility of the bureau. During this period, the bureau should devote its full efforts to municipal schools. In the near future, as long as they do not violate educational laws and regulations, they should be given the opportunity to develop fully within the possible range. Those who are absolutely impossible to improve and are solely for the purpose of profit will naturally only be resolutely banned.</p>
<p>Secondly, local educational administrative organs should abide by all educational laws and regulations promulgated by the central government, needless to say. However, in many cases, it is also necessary to take into account local conditions and handle matters with discretion. Because of the vastness of our country, the differences in customs and local conditions, and the uneven level of knowledge of the people, it is practically impossible to achieve uniformity by marking a boat to find a sword. Even in terms of the situation and environment of this city, it is different from the inland areas. The level of English and arithmetic, due to the urgency of need, should be higher than in other inland areas. This is actually unnecessary to hide. Moreover, in terms of reason and logic, textbooks that are suitable for place A may not be fully applicable to place B. If the local educational administrative organs in all provinces and cities of China do not understand the way to exercise discretion and only know the methods determined by the ministry and cannot be flexible at all, then the situation of cutting the feet to fit the shoes will occur frequently, often causing the schools to flow into falsification and completely focus on superficial articles, turning into a kind of formalistic education. As far as my personal feelings are concerned, we should now turn around and pay more attention to substance. For example, the bureau's review of the academic qualifications of new students and transfer students in each school is a complex and time-consuming task. In fact, the result is only the discovery of some forged certificates and altered certificates. If we emphasize substance across the board, not just diplomas, and pay attention to the entrance examinations of each school, strictly ban schools that speculate for profit, and support the development of excellent schools, then all the schools that remain will inevitably be unwilling to accept students of average and poor quality in order to maintain their reputation. And students who want to succeed by luck, even if they have diplomas, must pass strict examinations before they can transfer. Then the diploma is equal to waste paper. The organization of forged certificates will naturally disappear. Schools that speculate for profit will be difficult to survive without being banned. Here, I am only talking about one aspect of the emphasis on form. Other aspects are too numerous to mention, causing educational administrative organs to spend the thoughts and talents of many people on meaningless forms, and there will be no progress in the substance of education. If this atmosphere of emphasizing form changes and an atmosphere of emphasizing substance is cultivated, then the future of education will definitely be optimistic. Therefore, I believe that the local educational administrative organs should take responsibility and handle all affairs within the scope of the central educational laws and regulations, taking into account local conditions, and not just adhere to the form on paper. We must use most of our energy to improve the actual practice of education, so that we can live up to the citizens of Shanghai.</p>
<p>I hope that the colleagues of the bureau will fully understand the policy of reforming the education of this city that I have put forward, starting with the rectification of municipal schools. If the municipal schools are all well-managed and have excellent performance, then strictly supervising private schools will definitely be twice the result with half the effort.</p>
<p>Curriculum Standards for Junior and Senior High Schools</p>
<h3 id="e175">The Municipal Bureau of Education Orders All Schools to Comply <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Bureau of Education of this city has recently received an order from the Ministry of Education to issue curriculum standards for junior and senior high schools, and has specially instructed all schools in the city to comply. The order from the Ministry of Education states that the provisional standards for the general curriculum of junior high schools and senior high schools were previously announced by the ministry in August and October of the 18th year of the Republic of China, respectively, and ordered the educational departments of each province and city to try them out. The trial period for these provisional standards has exceeded three years, and the ministry has collected trial reports from each province and city, and invited personnel actually engaged in secondary education to hold meetings to discuss and draft the official standards for each subject, and hired experts in each subject to review these drafts in detail and make final corrections to make them perfect. Except for a few subjects that need to be announced slightly later, the curriculum standards for physical education, Chinese, English, arithmetic, biology, chemistry, history, and music for senior high schools, and the curriculum standards for physical education, hygiene, Chinese, English, chemistry, botany, zoology, history, labor, and music for junior high schools have been finalized and announced by the ministry.

<h3 id="e176">Correspondence School Enrolls Students Year-Round, Sets Up Lecture Classes in Different Districts for Face-to-Face Teaching <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Esperanto Society, founded in 1908, is the earliest Esperanto organization in China. Over the years, it has organized various activities, such as the Esperanto Correspondence School, Green Light Magazine, and Esperanto Bookstore and Library, with remarkable achievements. At present, 90% of Esperanto scholars in the country are from the Esperanto Correspondence School affiliated with the society. Unfortunately, during the January 28th Shanghai Incident last year, the society was located in Zhabei and was completely destroyed, and has been suspended since then. Now, after the efforts of the society's founders, Lu Shikai, Hu Yuzhi, and Sheng Guocheng, it has been officially restored recently. A general meeting of members was held yesterday, and many important cases were discussed and decided, and Lu Shikai, Hu Yuzhi, Sheng Guocheng, Chen Zhaoying, Ba Jin, Lu Yan, Huang Jingwan, and others were re-elected as executive and supervisory committee members, as well as faculty and staff of the correspondence school, and lecture classes for face-to-face teaching were set up in different districts of this city. For detailed information, please contact the society at No. 30 Hualong Road, French Concession, 3rd Floor, or send a letter to Shanghai Post Office Box 1332.</p>

<p>Fudan University's original preparatory course has had remarkable achievements since its establishment. The faculty of the department are mostly university professors who also hold concurrent positions. Most of the graduates who enter the university have excellent academic performance. Two years ago, after being renamed the High School Department in accordance with the order, it has been even more actively reorganized. Now, in order to cultivate elementary school teachers for the country and adapt to the needs of students' future prospects, the university affairs meeting has decided to add a normal school program starting this semester. The training strives to be strict and pays attention to practice. It is heard that those who have registered for the exam are quite enthusiastic.</p>
<p>The Vocational Education Society's Morning Class is Enrolling</p>
<h3 id="e179">A Good Opportunity for Workers to Study <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>The morning class of the First China Vocational Continuation School affiliated with the China Vocational Education Society at the intersection of Hualong Road and Huanlong Road in this city has been operating for four years since its establishment. On weekdays, Jiang Wenyu, Yang Weiyu, and Yao Huiquan personally teach. Those who have received education at the school have not only increased their knowledge, but also have excellent character. Working hard and treating people with politeness are the two main points of the school's training. In terms of national salvation work, the students of the class raised more than 2,000 yuan in donations for refugees from the Northeast in two months, and monthly donations are also nearly 100 yuan. Therefore, every morning when the sun rises, a group of working youth are often seen entering the school together on Hualong Road, with great interest. It is heard that the school has started its 18-day winter vacation on the 14th of this month, and classes will continue on February 1st. It is also scheduled to hold an exam for transfer students on January 30th. Ambitious youth can inquire in person from Mr. Xie Xiangzhi at the society, or attach a one-cent stamp to request a brochure from the class so as not to miss this great opportunity to study.</p>

<p>Muer Defeats Qing Xin, 34-20</p>
<p>The Shanghai Basketball Association's Group B, Divisions 1, 2, and 3 began last night. In the first match, Seven Stars forfeited, giving the Yi Team a win. The second match was Yao Guang against Chen Team, which was a one-sided affair. Yao Guang had well-rounded talent and admirable strategy, while Chen Team was far from their match. In the end, Yao Guang won 54-15. The third match was Jian Mei against Chu Guang, a mediocre performance. Chu Guang's strength has greatly diminished this year due to the dispersal of talent. As a result, Jian Mei won easily, 47-18. The fourth match featured the Hong Team, composed of athletes from the renowned Donghua Football Team, against the Liangxi Team from Wuxi. Donghua athletes such as Feng Yunyou and Chen Yutian were once top university basketball players, and Zhou Xianyan, Tu Kaiyuan, Chen Hongguang, and others were also experienced players. Therefore, their performance was still worth watching. However, due to a lack of training, their formation was disorganized, and their mumbling and comical actions added a lot of laughter. Liangxi had Song Jinhai, a former star from Labor University, whose strength was still good. As a result, they defeated the Hong Team 29-20. The main event was Muer against Qingxin, two evenly matched teams, competing fiercely. In the end, Muer won 34-12. The results of each group are as follows:</p>

<p>Result of Last Night's Friendly Match</p>
<p>57-34</p>
<p>The Fan Wang Du Basketball Team, formed by a combination of Yue Han Middle School, played a friendly practice match against the Hua Dong Company Basketball Team last night at the Yue Han basketball court. As a result, Fan Wang Du won 57-34. The score at halftime was 32-15. The two teams will have a second practice match tomorrow morning.</p>
<p>Fan Wang Du's Cooperation is Seamless Fan Wang Du is a team composed of Yue Han Middle School (the champion of this year's Western Youth Group B) and the university division. However, Chen Xianglong played for Hua Dong, with Cheng Jingxing as the center. The whole team cooperated very well, and Zhou Xuexian and Cheng Jingxing were the most accurate in shooting, with several very clever and impressive shots. They defeated Hua Dong 32-15 in the first half without much effort.</p>
<p>Hua Dong Lacks Shooting Talent Hua Dong mostly consists of veterans, but they are all talented guards. They have less confidence in shooting, so the second half was still dominated by Fan Wang Du. As a result, the final score was 57-34. The strength of the Fan Wang Du team, combined with some cooperative practice, should not be underestimated in the future. However, it is somewhat disappointing that the Shanghai Basketball Association will face Western Youth as their first opponent.</p>

<h3 id="e184">Hygiene Teaching Methods for Primary and Secondary Schools (3) - Lecture by Xu Suen, Recorded by Hua <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>Nutrition Teaching: Most schools in our country neglect the issue of nutrition.</p>
<p>It is no accident that most students look pale and thin. Foreign schools pay great attention to the nutritional quality of meals, treating dining halls as nutrition classrooms, teaching children how to eat and what to eat. When they see a child eating less, they will ask why to improve or treat the issue.</p>
<h3 id="e185">Hygiene Education Methods for Secondary Schools <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>Secondary school students are more difficult to manage than primary school students, but in some areas, they are also easier to teach. Hygiene education in secondary schools does not need to focus on trivial details but should instead focus on administration. Good administration will naturally lead to good hygiene conditions, while poor administration will cause hygiene conditions to deteriorate. From this, it can be seen that secondary school administration is a crucial key to hygiene education and should not be taken lightly.</p>
<p>The scope of hygiene education in secondary schools can be divided into three points: first, in-class teaching; second, integration with other subjects; and third, extracurricular activities. These will be discussed separately below.</p>
<h3 id="e186">In-Class Teaching Methods <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>Relying on textbooks, teachers teach, and students read. Who can't do that? However, repeating the mistakes of "teaching dead books," "teaching books to death," "teaching death," and "reading dead books," what good will it do? It should be known that hygiene teaching, in addition to textbooks, emphasizes training. But how easy is it to say training? Secondary school students have varying levels of understanding, and the curriculum is innovative, starting from the first year of junior high school, so problems arise one after another. The most fundamental difficulty is the source of good teaching materials. Only when the medical and educational communities work together in harmony can a solution be hoped for.</p>
<p>Past teaching materials first taught students to learn and memorize things like the skeletal and muscular systems, only making them feel burdened and not benefiting practical application. In the future, attention should be paid to relating teaching materials to students' lives. What benefit do students get from knowing how many bones are in the human body? Because this is irrelevant to life, it should be reformed as soon as possible. Issues of sexuality, the importance of cleanliness, prevention methods, and treatment skills are urgent and must be discussed and practiced before any progress can be made.</p>
<h3 id="e187">Interdisciplinary Teaching Methods <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>Studying hygiene diligently in hygiene class, but "discarding it like a worn shoe" in other subjects will still lead to the failure of hygiene education. Hygiene is related to the entire life, and based on the meaning of "education is life," it is not difficult to understand that each subject contains elements of hygiene. Due to time constraints, interdisciplinary teaching methods cannot be discussed in detail. Here are a few examples from mathematics: for example, calculating the comparative growth rate of bacteria, statistics on mortality rates for certain diseases, and finding the formula for certain drugs. As for biology, chemistry, and physics, there are even more opportunities to teach hygiene.</p>
<h3 id="e188">Extracurricular Teaching Methods <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>Extracurricular teaching methods focus on administrative matters, with environmental facilities being the most important issue. Some people, when they hear "facilities," immediately think of "economic difficulties," and thus, things that cannot be solved are resolved with these four words. It should be known that environmental facilities do not necessarily require money. Clean toilets, in addition to having running water and toilets, only require diligent cleaning to be hygienic. Conversely, if the school officials forget to supervise cleaning, even with excellent facilities, they will be filthy. A lot of money will be spent in vain. Mosquitoes and flies are everywhere, and spiderwebs are not swept away. I would like to ask, is it not economic difficulty? In short, environmental facilities do not need to have a "foreign" label. It is not considered respectable only if a lot of money is spent. Being able to rationalize is the best approach. Next, let's talk about medical facilities. Shanghai has a health bureau, and the bureau has a special school health section, which has been of great help in the progress of school hygiene education. However, teachers should use medical facilities. First aid skills, knowledge of ventilation, and the arrangement of teaching schedules all require special attention.</p>
<p>Hygiene education in high school is particularly important because students are approaching graduation. In the near future, they will become parents and enter society. Hygiene issues not only affect themselves but also others.</p>
<p>Secondary school students often nitpick and find fault with the school's shortcomings, which are often related to poor hygiene. They then use this as an excuse, and the school's reputation is completely lost. In such schools, it is impossible not to fall into a state of chaos. Therefore, how can school hygiene still be neglected? (End)</p>

<p>— Zhan Lu</p>
<p>| Second Song of Strange Customs of the World |</p>
<p>Cock-a-doodle-doo! Cock-a-doodle-doo! Women of the South Sea Islands are forbidden from killing chickens! Killing chickens is the husband's job, how can you blame a wife? It is the duty of men to wield the knife, it is not proper for women to cut meat; this custom has been passed down for who knows how long? Overseas is strange, strange and stranger! It's not that women don't have the strength to tie up a chicken, it's not that women can't cut a chicken without drawing blood; it's just that there are many taboos involved, and men exclusively master the secrets of killing chickens. When a man wields the knife to kill a chicken, the taste is better than a grand feast; the meat is surely better than bear's paw, the soup is just like drinking nectar. It can be enjoyed by guests in large bites, and the soup can satisfy the wife. If a woman wields the knife, the chicken will not be delicious or flavorful; the meat will be tasteless like chewing wax, and the soup will be as bland as tap water; try tasting it, and you will frown, such bland soup is shameful. Hearing this is laughable, the superstition is full of doubts; but after careful consideration, this custom passed down is also reasonable, women have always been soft-hearted, and do not like slaughtering living things; they don't like it, and their intention is clever; they encourage men to be cruel. They falsely claim that men have a knack for cutting meat, and the men are pleased; they boast that their skills are superior to women, not knowing that they have been tricked! "Note" If I wanted to kill chickens, I would wield the knife. Alas! Not wielding the knife is a woman's virtue, killing chickens is exclusively the job of men; the man kills the chicken and the woman eats it, and the taste is truly unparalleled!</p>

<p>— Yong Zi</p>
<p>| Anesthetizing the People of Nanjing |</p>
<p>This time, I went to Nanjing on official business, and I took care of official matters in one breath, putting public affairs before private interests. After completing the official business, I then indulged myself (not misappropriating public funds) and toured the Qinhuai River, Xuanwu Lake, and Confucius Temple.</p>
<p>The Shandong hollow rich man, Liang the Millionaire, had already disappeared from my mind, but strangely, when I returned from Nanjing, I was filled with Liang, the God of Wealth.</p>
<p>Here's how it happened. The first night I arrived in Nanjing, I stayed in a small inn in Xiaguan, when I overheard a visitor calling on someone in the next room, a fellow provincial from Jiangxi. The two engaged in a heated debate, and finally, the guest indignantly said, "You talk a good game, but you don't pay your debts. You're just like Liang, the God of Wealth from Shandong." With that, he slammed the door and left.</p>
<p>The next day, I was eager to use the pit and liberate myself, so I stepped into the toilet, only to find it teeming with business. I thought, the toilet is a place for wonderful writing, so I might as well take this opportunity to admire the capital's toilet walls. Great, among slogans like "Selling Severe Colds" and "XX Was Here," I found the slogan "Liang, the God of Wealth is here, nothing is taboo." Liang, the God of Wealth, had actually usurped the position of Jiang Taigong.</p>
<p>In the evening, I went to the bathhouse to wash, and the back scrubber scrubbed my back while saying, "Liang, the God of Wealth used to come here to bathe, and I scrubbed his back." He seemed to think that with Liang, the God of Wealth's arrival, even the bathhouse had become a scenic spot, and scrubbing Liang, the God of Wealth's back made one a person of importance. But it is said that Liang, the God of Wealth, never bathed all year round. Whether the back scrubber was lying, I could not verify. According to my friends, the phrase "I am Liang, the God of Wealth" is surprisingly effective for driving away beggars. There are many people in Nanjing who don't know that Japan has already formed a puppet government in the Northeast, but when it comes to Liang, the God of Wealth, no one doesn't know Liang, the God of Wealth's birthday. Therefore, if a great writer were to pick up a pen and write a history of Nanjing, Liang, the God of Wealth, would not be without a place.</p>

<p>| The Heart Is Cold Enough Without Enjoying the Snow |</p>
<p>It snowed all day the day before yesterday. Sitting at home, I felt even colder because I didn't have a heater. It's better to run outside, so I put on two shoes and went to the road to enjoy the snow. This is also a special way to enjoy the snow!</p>
<p>As soon as I walked out of the alley, I saw three men in suits, their heads shrunk into their coats, talking about dancing. One with a taller body had a particularly wonderful theory. He said, "This smooth and firm snow ground is truly a very good and natural dance floor."</p>
<p>At the tram stop, I met seven or eight female students who had just finished class, wearing fur coats and still complaining about the cold, but they were making plans to go to Zhaofeng Park tomorrow to make a big snowman. One female student was pessimistically saying, "I'm afraid it won't snow again tomorrow, or it will melt, wouldn't that be terrible?"</p>
<p>I think it's best to invite this dance-loving friend, if they have the courage, to go to the Shanhaiguan area, not only can they often dance on the natural smooth floor, but they can also ice skate without spending a penny.</p>
<p>As for these female students who want to build a big snowman, I would like to invite them to visit Guanwai. The snow there is both high and thick, and it will never melt. Moreover, the volunteers there are covered in snow, aren't they a big and lively snowman?</p>
<p>Without enjoying the snow, the heart is cold enough.</p>
<h3 id="e193">Record of the Saraca Flower Pavilion <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>— Yin Qiu</p>
<p>There are two painters in Suzhou: one is Wu Hufan, and the other is Wu Zishen. They are of similar age, share the same ambitions, and appreciate each other's talents and skills. Hufan specializes in cursive and regular script calligraphy. They haven't seen each other for twenty years. Zishen is currently involved in artistic education during turbulent times. His younger brother, Bingyi, who resembles an orchid, is also famous for his paintings, and it seems he is the youngest. His works are pure, fresh, and dashing, just like him. He particularly enjoys traveling far, admiring the grandeur of the Forbidden City and the perilousness of the Great Wall in the north, and the vastness and depth of the Yellow River. Recently, he ascended Mount Tai to watch the sunrise. Wherever he went, he would hold a brush and ink to record the scenic spots, creating travelogues of tens of thousands of words. His spirit grew stronger, and his paintings also improved. After returning, he planted a Saraca tree in his new residence in Baihua Lane. Its flowers are ancient, elegant, and lovely. Mr. Taiyan then inscribed the name of his studio as "Saraca Flower Pavilion." Silan invited about a dozen fellow painters to paint and write within it, forming the Saraca Painting Society. The society gathers twice a month to create paintings together, providing for their shared interests. The proceeds from the paintings are entirely used to help the poor, embodying charity in art, with the noblest of intentions. Silan particularly advocates that art must deeply penetrate the common people to arouse aesthetic awareness and inspire ancient sentiments, which would benefit public morals and customs. He also rented several houses by the North Cang Bridge in Guanqian, establishing another studio, still named Saraca, with bright windows and white walls, elegantly structured, displaying many famous calligraphy and paintings. A corner of the small building has tea bowls and chessboards for resting. It serves as a place for circulating calligraphy and paintings and a gathering place for literati. He also provides Hui ink, Huzhou brushes, She inkstones, Hangzhou paper, as well as ink pads and seals, fulfilling all the needs for painting and writing. On the opening day, I went with Shou Juan. Silan warmly welcomed us, as if we were old friends. Both love flowers with the same passion. Shou Juan loves violets just as Silan loves Saraca flowers. Since living in Suzhou, I have visited his residence twice, where violets bloomed in the courtyard like embroidery. Old Qin Nan painted a "Violet Hermitage" picture and wrote an inscription to display it. Now, Silan's Saraca Flower Pavilion is very close by, shining brightly in the art world. Isn't this a wonderful story of our time? I am happy to record it.</p>

<p>— Liao Hongshou Juan</p>
<p>When Xiao Man said these words, she seemed less like a mature young woman and more like a charming girl. Sometimes, when she was happy, she would add a few more words: "Little darlings, be good! Listen to me, just focus on keeping your bodies plump and white. Don't let your old ailments return during the seasonal changes. That's how you'll repay us..." All these words, though delivered in a jesting tone, were enough to make his face flush. However, upon careful consideration, every word was affectionate, and every sentence was sincere, naturally increasing his gratitude towards them. The extreme gratitude, in turn, caused him to feel intense sorrow. What he grieved was why he didn't have such a wonderful home. Sometimes, it would even give rise to a strange fantasy. What he imagined was that his body could somehow shrink and become smaller, and then he could throw himself into their loving embrace.</p>
<p>Time quietly slipped away as people busied themselves. In the blink of an eye, spring gracefully descended upon the earth. Among all things in the world, none are more beautiful than the spring countryside. Every blade of grass and every tree basks in the spring light, shedding yesterday's desolation and releasing a vibrant vitality. The air seems to be filled with intoxicating warmth. Everything around is replete with colors. Even the most skilled painter, with his masterful control of colors, could not create such a complete palette. Above, the sky is blue and clear; the clouds are white as fresh cotton; scattered among the fields are菜花 and grass, interspersed with碎金 and翡翠. The swaying weeping willows are as green as mist. Several peach trees, swaying in the wind, reveal the blushing cheeks of young girls. People with sensitive natures, when faced with such a scene, how could they not be intoxicated? Not only humans, but even the birds are unwilling to let this spring pass by lightly. They also call their companions, flying and dancing on the newly adorned branches, singing romantic ditties that require no effort to compose. The butterflies, not skilled at singing, take advantage of this fragrant season to freely wear the charming new clothes bestowed upon them by nature, busy visiting their lovers—the wildflowers that stand alone and appreciate their own beauty by the roadside. This is probably when God, drunk on fine wine, suddenly became excited and inspired by an aesthetic thought, and thus used his greatest artistic skills to adorn so many pleasing sounds and colors, both to amuse himself and to delight mankind.</p>
<p>He deeply remembered that, at this time, the invisible spring invitations often invited him and the Dongfang Sheng couple to this quiet and beautiful road. Sometimes, the three of them went out together; sometimes, Xiao Man was unable to spare the time due to household chores, so he and Dongfang Sheng went together; there were also times when Dongfang Sheng had no interest in going out, so he was accompanied by the childlike Xiao Man, a pair like children, jumping here.</p>

<p>— Zhang Ruo Yu</p>
<p>(Two) Black Eyes</p>
<p>Ten years ago, after reading French writer Alphonse Daudet's "Little Thing," the heroine with the big black eyes in that novel has remained in my memory to this day.</p>
<p>Black eyes are a special treasure endowed to Eastern girls. How can fair-haired lads enjoy碧綠蔚藍秋波? They always harbor vague yearnings and mysterious notions about black eyes.</p>
<p>Near Avenue Joffre and Avenue du Roi Albert, in a narrow lane, there is a mysterious midnight dance hall. The dance hall is a茅屋-style hall, with walls painted with vividly colored patterns: bright red, bright green, deep yellow, deep blue, with thick lines, expressing the flavor of primitive tribal art. The walls are covered with尖角 shape, colorful felt carpets, even more luxurious and刺戟 than Persian Tianjin specialties, adding a layer of warmth and charm to the whole room.</p>
<p>The entrance is a corridor with frescoes of strange figures. A White Russian old man, wearing a royal uniform and adorned with medals and寶星 on his chest, is managing the cloakroom.</p>
<p>Walking into the grand dance floor is like being in an Arabian palace. Turkish music and American red-skinned Indian jazz震蕩 women's hearts and agitate men's desires. And those百色 female dance partners wearing five-colored scarves and red包頭 silk, their black eyes wide open, their tired, long eyelashes drooping, those pairs of big, round black eyes逼視 you,挑逗 you; if you are a膽小的 man, can't stand such charm挑逗? You will surely feel cramped, even your face will blush.</p>
<p>Raising your head, on the back wall of the music stage, are a pair of black eyes. The crazed dancing men and women of all countries and styles dare not look directly at this pair of powerful, mysterious eyes, and in his and her eyes, they see the opponent's fire-like green and blue eyes.</p>
<p>The sky is always a vast blue, a large piece of blue陰丹士林 fabric covering the simple roof. There, you can't see white walls, nor even half a piece of gray tile.</p>
<p>After twelve o'clock, at the moment of handover between last night and this morning, the dance floor begins to liven up. People coming out of the last show in the cinema, or those who have finished the last dance in another dance hall, flow here like tides.</p>
<p>A night traveler on Avenue Joffre is a regular at this midnight dance hall. He praises its advantages: there is no class, no gentility, no nationality, no distinction between races. Mr. Black can dance with Mrs. White. The waiter can sit down and share a cigarette with you in his spare time, or talk about family matters and entertainment. You don't have to worry. If you are hot, you can take off your jacket, even turn up the sleeves of your shirt. Even if you are a little drunk, you won't slip and fall while dancing on the floor. However, there is heat, there is charm, there is the逼視 of the black eyes on the wall, and there is the挑逗 of the black eyes in the hall.</p>
<p>This unique mysterious midnight dance hall on Avenue Joffre is called "Black Eyes."</p>
<p>All those who remember the heroine in "Little Thing" might as well go to this dance hall and spend a night through the wee hours; you can find black eyes among black eyes.</p>

<p>The Calm Gold Market Without Financial Ripples</p>
<h3 id="e197">Rose 5.6 Taels and Broke Through 800 Taels <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>According to yesterday's foreign telegraphs, London大條 (gold bars) rose slightly both in the near and distant futures at .0625. Both the British-American and American-British exchange rates also saw slight increases. The Bank of America also rose by .125. Although the silver market for forward contracts saw only small gains according to private telegrams from banks, market sentiment was excellent. Although it opened at a flat rate of 797.3 taels, this price was completely unexpected. Therefore, it rose immediately after opening to 801.7 taels. Generally, within 800 taels, there was a lack of sellers. Once it broke through the 800-tael mark, transactions occurred. At this time, the bank's opening price was also better than the previous closing. Although the domestic market could not be called tight, it was very stable. Therefore, the gold price was able to stand above 800 taels. The HSBC exchange rate also narrowed, allowing the gold market to have an opportunity to rise. The morning market hovered around .01 taels. The Central Bank once opened spot sales at 105條. By the time it was near closing,潤昌裕 advanced (on behalf of 潤昌永). Because the bank's appetite for performance was good, and Mumbai reported a decline, it reached 804 taels. In the end, it returned to a peaceful state, and the city had no disturbances. The result was a closing price of 802.9 taels. There were very few large transactions throughout the day, and market sentiment was very stable. The premium on deferred contracts was large, reaching 2.8 taels, possibly because the source of spot goods decreased, causing panic among short sellers. Various rumors also arose because of this. Today, the daily fluctuations are recorded below:</p>
<h3 id="e198">Opening Price Too Low, Sellers Vanished <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>Although the opening price was 797.3 taels, this price was extremely difficult to obtain, so it jumped up immediately after opening. 大德成 and物品套頭 (arbitrageurs) scrambled to buy條 (gold bars), but there were very few transactions within the 800-tael mark, so they could only sigh. (The物品 opening price was 799.5 taels). 福興永志豐永來進 broke through the 800-tael mark to 801.7 taels. 大德成 then came to the market to sell, so the price dropped slightly. This month's British exchange rate was at 1 shilling 8 pence, and the American dollar at 9375, also had sellers, making the price 800 taels. 福餘 advanced條, rising to .07 taels, and hovering outside 800 taels. 物品套 released條, breaking through 800 taels to 99.5 taels. At this time, it was predicted that the HSBC exchange rate would shrink by .125 for both British and American currencies. 志豐永來進 was up by about two taels, to .07 taels. When the official HSBC exchange rate was revealed to be low, it reached 1.3 taels, but益豐 sold條 at the 1-tael limit, and兆豐昌 also sold at the limit, so it fell back to within 1 tael. When兆豐昌 sold at the market price, it fell to 800 taels. 三井 bought 美金 at 28.125元 for April, twice in a row. 恒餘 and 大興永 scrambled to buy, rising to 01.7 taels. At this time, it hovered for a long time, and trading was light. After 11 o'clock, 安達 sold January at 28元, so it hovered and fell to 01 taels. 瑞興 accepted slightly, adding a few coins. 潤昌裕 (on behalf of the Central Bank) opened spot sales, but not many, totaling 105條. Although the price was increased to 01.1 taels, it was still low. 永豐 accepted slightly, then increased from 01 taels to 07 taels. Finally, it was slightly盘旋 and closed at 800 taels and .05 taels. 物品拍 (auctioned) at the same price.</p>
<h3 id="e199">The Afternoon Market Appeared at 804 Taels <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>The afternoon market opened slightly higher by .01 tael, at 800 taels and .06 taels. 生大 and 恒餘 bought slightly at .01 taels. 福餘 and 恒昌永 advanced to 1.8 taels. 物品 then sold at 1.4 taels. 各豐 ate February's 美金 at 28元. 志豐永來 accepted, and immediately rose to over 2 taels. 福餘 advanced again, (reportedly on behalf of 成豐永). 志豐永 also continued to buy, so it rose to .03 taels.散户 sold, and the market was extremely light,盘旋 down to 1.9 taels. Thereafter, it hovered outside 2 taels for quite some time without advancing or retreating. When Mumbai 電吿 (telegraph) reported a small drop of 3 Anna, it rose again to 2.78 taels. 物品 continued to sell條, and 瑞康 suddenly covered short positions at this time, but the momentum was very slow, so although the price temporarily seemed to stand still, there was no upward trend. 盘旋 was also frequent. 花旗 also bought 美金 in January at 9375, and although恒興 advanced in small amounts, the market price was still raised to above 3 taels. 天豐永 also came to buy aggressively, reaching .04 taels. Thereafter, near the closing,散户 and 物品 alternately advanced and retreated slightly, with a slight decline. Finally, it closed at 802.9 taels. 物品 was slightly lower, auctioned at 802.5 taels. The day was calm, with the highest price at 804 taels and the lowest at 797.3 taels, a difference of 6.7 taels, but the actual opening price was too low, and there was very little activity within 800 taels. The result was a rise of 5.6 taels compared to the previous closing.</p>
<h3 id="e200">Reduced the Price by About One Taels <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>The揭價 (official exchange rate) was lowered by HSBC to .125 for the 美金, making it 27.625元, so the gold price was also changed to 868.78 taels, a difference of 65.88 taels. (Based on the closing price.) Based on the opening price (lowest), it had to be adjusted to more than 71 taels. The result was a reduction of 1.68 taels compared to the previous closing. The登賬價 (book value) for January and February were both 803 taels, and the登賬價 for March was 801 taels. The补水 (premium) was 803 taels in the morning and 805 taels in the afternoon.</p>
<h3 id="e201">Arrival Obstructed, Prices Rise Sharply <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the炒赤 (speculation in silver bars) price涨风 (upward trend) intensified, with people initially seeking goods at more than 10 taels. 盈豐恒 then came to raise the price and buy, calculated at an increase of 12 taels, a jump of 2 taels compared to the previous day. Sellers seemed to be helpless. 盈豐恒 sold 70 taels to 大豐恒 at a price of 10 taels, but this price was not easy to obtain. Although the price was increased to 12 taels afterwards, there were few transactions, reportedly because the original 800 taels of spot goods arriving in Shanghai today suddenly had an accident en route. This resulted in a lack of sellers and an increased demand (盈豐恒).</p>
<h3 id="e202">Panic Among Short Sellers <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, there were few round-number (整數) transactions in the掉期 (swap) market. Initially, 恒餘 was willing to貼進 (pay a premium) at 2.5 taels, but not in large amounts. 恒興 then貼予恒餘 2.3 taels, totaling 70條, and also貼予乾昌祥 at the same price, totaling 105條. Later,恒興 again, at a price of 2.4 taels, swapped 35條 to both 乾昌祥 and 大豐恒. Later, 瑞康貼予盈豐恒 2.8 taels, totaling 42條. As of the day before yesterday, the條额 (amount of bars) for January was 133條, and the amount for February was 3,780條. Those who had not yet settled their swaps, such as 恒興 and 恒餘, each had as many as more than 1,000. In addition, 乾昌祥, 盈豐恒, 源茂永, were also multi-directional. The short side was largest with 大德成, also more than 1,000. 瑞康, 同豐恒, 潤昌永, 源新永, 大豐恒, 昌升永, 景福, etc., were also in short positions.</p>
<h3 id="e203">Over-the-Counter Trading Becomes Quiet Again <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>But there was a slight resurgence. In summary, 天豐永, 福興永, 志豐永, 福餘, 乾昌祥, 瑞興, 萃泰, 瑞康, 恒興, 大興永, 潤昌裕, and others均進 (mainly bought), and 益豐, 元亨, 源茂永, 萬興, 慶發永, 永豐, 顺利, etc., were on the selling side. 大德成 and 恒餘 advanced before selling, and 兆豐昌 and 元春 sold before buying. 大連幫, 萬興, and 顺利 sold, but very little. 廣帮 生大 only began trading in the afternoon, buying little. 恒興 also略爲軋進 (slightly bought in to cover short positions). 益豐 sold slightly, generally with demand exceeding supply. As of the day before yesterday, the new交易 (transactions) on the March塲 totaled 17,605條.</p>
<h3 id="e204">Foreign Exchange Occasionally Shows a Slight Edge <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's exchange rate market was extremely flat. The 大條 (gold bars) near and distant futures both shrunk by .0625. The British-American exchange rate was .25, and the American-British exchange rate was also .125. Therefore, the British exchange rate opened very flat, with a near-term asking price of 1 shilling and 8 pence. Although New York's silver price rose by .125, the largest rise in the forward silver market was 1厘2 (1.2%), and the smallest was only 4毫 (0.4%). American cotton was down 14磅音. Therefore, market sentiment was excellent. The 美金 market opened紧 (tight) for near-term contracts, at 28元. Afterward, because HSBC's listing narrowed by .125 for both shilling and 美金, it became even tight, but it only advanced and retreated within .0625. The afternoon market continued to be紧, and Mumbai also千跌下 (fell by a lot). The domestic market was extremely flat, but occasionally showed a slight edge. 花旗 and 正金 aggressively bought 美金, and 華比 and 中孚塞 (stuffed, sold). 豐 slightly塞 (sold) shillings. The gold industry had no activity. The difference was about .0625 and .125 throughout the day. The result was that the British exchange rate was tighter by .0625 compared to the previous closing, and the 美金 exchange rate was tighter by about .1875. The bank's daily transactions are recorded below:</p>
<p>(英匯 - British Exchange Rate): Equal to the previous closing price, with a near-term asking price of 1 shilling and 8 pence. HSBC sold January at 1 shilling and 8 pence to 三并. HSBC also sold April at .0625 to 沙遜. 沙遜 also stopped April at .0625, which was sold by 華比. The closing price in the afternoon ranged from 1 shilling 7 pence 9375 to 1 shilling 8 pence .0625. There were no transactions in the afternoon, so the closing price remained the same. The buying price was increased by .0625.</p>
<p>(美匯 - American Exchange Rate): The morning opening was 紧 (tight) by .0625 compared to the previous closing, with a near-term asking price of 28元. 花旗 bought April at 1875 from 住友. 中孚 bought the same month at the same price twice, which was sold by 中南 and 東亞. 花旗 also bought April at 1875, and January at 28元. 沙遜 sold April at .125 to 三井. 三井 also ate the same month at the same price. 花旗 ate January at 28元 from 安達. The opening price in the afternoon ranged from 27.9375元 for January, 28元 for February, .0625 for March, and .125 for April, with the buying price increased by .0625. In the afternoon, 中孚 first塞 (sold) April at .125, and 安達 also sold the same month at the same price, both of which were taken by 花旗. 三井 also bought孟買 (Mumbai) April at .125. 華比 sold January at 9375 to 正金. 中孚 sold February at 28元 to 和豐. 正金 also ate January at 9375 from 華比. 中孚 sold January at 9375 and March at .0625. 花旗脱予正金January at 9375. Suddenly扒 (bought) April at .125 twice, which was sold by 華比 and 中孚. 三井 ate April at the same price. 中孚 sold February at the same price. 正金 ate January at 9375. By the time of closing, the asking price was 27.875元 for January, with a迭加(progressive increase) of .0625 thereafter. The buying price was also increased by .0625. One 美金元 (US dollar) equaled 3 taels 6錢 1分 9釐 9毫 (a traditional Chinese unit of currency).</p>
<h3 id="e205">Gold Bars Slightly Reduced by .0625 <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>國民社 (National News Agency) reported from London on the 17th: Gold bars shrunk by .0625 in both near and distant futures. The near-term盘價 (market price) was 16 pence 8125, and the distant term was 16 pence 875. The British-American exchange rate opened at 3元 3角 5分 .56.</p>
<h3 id="e206">Call Loan Market Quiet <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, it was snowy and very cold. Generally, merchants were apprehensive and did not move forward. People were scarce in the market, and the morning market was completely indifferent. The market atmosphere was calmer than ever. Banks had no intention of buying or selling, and Qianzhuang (money shops) also had no large-scale openings. Only the morning market showed a slight improvement, but it did not reach the prosperity of the past.</p>
<h3 id="e207">Call Loan <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>Due to the scarcity of transactions in the "foreign cent" early market, the market price had no competition and remained at the previous early market price of 7錢1分3釐2毫5忽 (a traditional Chinese unit of currency).</p>
<p>The afternoon market fell another 3毫7忽5, to 7錢1分2釐8毫7忽5. The "silver call loan" for both the morning and afternoon markets was 2分, blank white. The silver market was as loose as ever.</p>

<p>The difficulties in concluding the current outstanding debts have been detailed in this newspaper. According to reports from the silver and money industry, the collection of outstanding debts from foreign ports is even more urgent than last year. For example, the outstanding debts from Jiangsu and Zhejiang, in the year 21, frequently encountered national disasters and commercial decline reached its peak. The harvest failures of agricultural products are undeniable, and the economic distress cannot be salvaged by human power. Those who had no choice but to request轉賬 (transfer) were common, but the Shanghai financial community, for the sake of審慎 (caution) and self-defense, was unwilling to reluctantly agree. It is necessary to make a serious further collection effort, but no matter how strictly it is urged, what is received is still寥寥 (very little).</p>
<p>Securities</p>
<h3 id="e211">Bond Market Rebounded Later <a href="#e211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday (17th), the bond market situation at the Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange, except for the 現市 (spot market) remaining清 (slack), the期货 (futures) transactions were also績遜前 (less active than before). The market popularity became more and more閒 (slack), and the進出交易 (in and out transactions) between each盤 (market session) was always very rare. As for the trend of the bond prices, since there was no new development in the環象 (overall situation), all the 大戶 (large traders) were懷觀望 (observing). In the early morning盤, because the buying氣 (sentiment) was extremely清, the price continued the trend of the previous day and continued to decline, each roughly小三四角 (a small three or four 角 - a unit of currency). In the afternoon, the市上零戶 (retail traders in the market) began收進 (buying in) more, so each價 (price) began漸行回堅 (gradually strengthened). As a result, compared to the previous day, only 裁兵 (disarmament) 96 this month's期 (contract) and 二○關 (20% customs)現貨 (spot goods) continued to微跌 (slightly decline), and the others all回漲 (rebounded), totaling好 (good) one or two 角 to五六角 (five or six 角), with市面情况 (the market situation) still being靜定 (quiet and stable). The spot transactions totaled only 4,000元, and the 期貨 (futures) totaled 5,755,500元 for the whole day, including統 (unified) and 稅 (tax) each about 1.2 million, 20捲(20 volumes) 800,000, and the remainder about 500,000. 96 (1996 contract), 6 (6% interest rate), and 關稅 (customs) were still甚清 (very slack).</p>

<p>New Feng Yanghang (New Feng Foreign Firm) reported that on Monday (16th), the New York stock market was initially尚堅挺 (still firm), but later, due to the uncertainty of the農村救濟案 (rural relief bill), and according to reports,玉蜀 (corn)可見供給 (available supply) increased 735,000蒲歇爾(bushels), causing價先疲 (the price to weaken first), and the股市 (stock market) then also繼之下跌 (followed the decline). The total volume of transactions for the day was 870,000 shares. The closing prices of several stocks are recorded below: (unit: 元) Adam Investment Trust 4.75, American Can 58, American Tobacco 62, National Public 2.5, Curtis Aircraft 2, Texas Aircraft 12, Fox Pictures 2, International Telephone &amp; Telegraph 7.25, Citibank 43, Parker Automobile 2.5,電拏煙草 (Denali Tobacco) 32, Union Pacific Railroad 73, United Public Securities 9, US Steel 28.5, with the Dow Jones index listed on the left:</p>

<p>The yarn market remained unremarkable, and customer sales felt increasingly sluggish. However, some anticipated a rise in prices next spring, leading to some market absorption. Recently, foreign cotton yarn has been relatively weak, and exchange rates have been stable with no fluctuations. Judging by the overall trend, there is a lack of momentum for price increases.</p>
<h3 id="e214">Bullish Bets on Renbiao Increased <a href="#e214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>The Renbiao market opened lower, influenced by a drop of over ten pounds in American cotton. Market sentiment was scattered, and Yichang offered 2,000 bales, weakening the market. Prices fell by two cents across all months, except for the current month, which remained relatively high due to arbitrage activities. In the afternoon, bullish investors at Changfeng continued to purchase and increase their positions, resulting in a slight tightening. Prices rose by two, three, and four cents across various months. The total daily trading volume was 13,250 bales. Sales included 1,050 bales by Yicheng, 2,000 bales by Yichang, 500 bales by Lichang, 250 bales by Ruidai, and 250 bales by Renfeng. Purchases included 2,400 bales by Changfeng, 600 bales by Xiesheng, 550 bales by Yukang, 500 bales by Mingde, 400 bales by Taichang, 400 bales by Taixing, and 400 bales by Xincheng. Closing prices are as follows:</p>

<p>A review of the daily purchases by various dealers showed a total of 460 bales, with prices rising slightly by two and a half cents. Purchase amounts by dealer group are as follows:</p>
<p>Guangdong 365, Inland 36, Wuhu 5, Fujian 15</p>
<p>Ningbo 20, Xiamen 10, Hankou 10</p>
<p>The cotton market remains calm. American cotton is trending downwards again. However, most local players believe that bottom stocks are drying up, the weather is severely cold, water levels are low, and rivers are freezing, leading to a scarcity of supply. Bullish forces remain strong and unwilling to loosen their grip. However, the short positions for this month's delivery are likely adequately covered with coarse cotton. Future developments will depend on the movement of American and Indian cotton.</p>
<h3 id="e216">Bullish Investors Hold on to Zheng Biao <a href="#e216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>The Zheng Biao market opened weaker, with softer sentiment due to falling American cotton. Prices fell by one and a half cents across all months. After a slight rebound in the second and third sessions, prices ended down by five cents. In the afternoon, bullish investors increased their positions, driving prices up by five cents to one cent. The total daily trading volume was 35,400 dan. Sales included 1,100 dan by Dafu, 1,500 dan by Suilong, 2,100 dan by Yicheng, 1,900 dan by Yichang, 2,800 dan by Yuanda, 2,400 dan by Yuanda, and 1,900 dan by Xinheng.

<p>Thin rice in the Southern Market and Yin Yuan Sales are Dull, Falling 20-30 Cents</p>
<p>(North Shanghai): Yesterday, over ten shipments arrived in Hexia. Transactions for high-quality white japonica rice were average, while mid- to lower-quality rice sold reasonably well. The market for high-quality rice was stable, while mid- to lower-quality rice was tight, exceeding market expectations. Arrivals of thin rice were sluggish, with prices weakening. Arrivals of early rice were limited but sales were active, with prices showing a tightening trend. Arrivals of Yang Du sharp rice were not strong, but sales were good, with prices tightening, exceeding market expectations. Arrivals of port-specific sharp rice were lacking. Arrivals of Yin Bai Yuan were not numerous, and retail sales were quite good, with prices increasing by 10-20 cents.</p>
<p>(South Shanghai): Yesterday, there were 30-40 arrivals. The market condition is that the approaching end of the lunar year has led to retail congestion, and bulk buyers have stopped purchasing. Therefore, rice from Changzhou, Suzhou, and Nantong, including thin rice, has fallen by 20-30 cents. Arrivals of Yin Yuan were numerous, but sales were sluggish, also falling by about 30 cents. There was no market for Du Yang sharp rice.</p>
<p>Guest Xian and Minhua Rice Remain Active</p>
<h3 id="e222">Foreign Merchants Selling Futures for Foreign Rice <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's Guest Xian market saw continued inquiries from Fuzhou dealers. Arrivals were not numerous, and remaining stocks were mainly held by囤户(tun hu) (speculators). Floating stocks were scarce, resulting in a gradual increase in market prices. A total of 579 bags of Hunan processed rice were handled by Fuzhou dealers, priced from $9.22 to $9.15.</p>
<p>Although foreign rice stocks are sufficient, floating stocks on the market have already been sold off. Most of the current stock is held by foreign merchants and a small number of囤户(tun hu) (speculators), who are unwilling to sell due to high costs. However, Annam rice prices are showing a downward trend. Yesterday, foreign merchants were again soliciting new trades. Saigon No. 1 rice was only 4 liang and 2-3 qian, and small-grain rice was only 3 liang and 7-8 qian. Saigon rice was under $9, and small-grain rice was under $8. The local market price was about 70-80 cents higher. However, orders are placed for the long term. Although rice merchants are tentatively buying, they are wary due to past experiences and dare not rashly complete the transaction.</p>
<h3 id="e223">Flour Market Initially Weak, Then Strong <a href="#e223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's flour market showed an initial weakness followed by a strengthening trend in all months after the opening in the morning and afternoon. As the price of foreign wheat continued to fall slightly by 20 cents, sentiment weakened at the initial opening in the morning. The current month fell to a low of $1.29425, and distant months also fell by about 500. However, after the second session, the market across all months gradually recovered. Although customer demand appeared quiet, Fuzhou and other new buyers were experiencing a shortage of現貧軋缺 (xian pin ya que), and there was some resistance to decline for January and February, stabilizing market sentiment. By the afternoon opening, trading across all months had not improved, but factories continued to resist declining prices for January and February. Customer demand also saw some trading in distant months, leading to a gradual increase in opening prices. Despite the frequent deliveries of foreign wheat, the current shortage of spot goods makes it difficult for market sentiment to decline. (Fu Feng increased by 8 cents, and Xin Tai increased by 6 cents.) As a result, the current month rose by 1 cent compared to the previous day, February rose by 2 cents, March rose by 1.25 cents, April rose by 1.5 cents, May rose by 1.25 cents, and June rose by 1.75 cents.</p>
<h3 id="e224">Wheat Market Still Lacks Momentum <a href="#e224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>(Impact of Arriving Foreign Wheat Prepared for Delivery)</p>
<p>Yesterday's futures wheat market showed an initial weakness followed by stability across all months after the opening in the morning and afternoon. In the morning, as foreign wheat prices continued to fall by over 20 cents, sentiment softened, and opening prices across all months fell by 1-2 cents compared to the previous day. By the afternoon opening, the current month was approaching delivery, and although buyers wanted to resist the decline, sellers were experiencing fatigue due to the arrival of foreign wheat prepared for delivery. Distant months initially remained weak, but later improved as the flour market turned better, leading to improved sentiment. However, traders still hold several hundred cars of goods that have not been hedged, so there will be further movement after the goods arrive. As a result, the current month fell by 2 cents compared to the previous day, February and March fell by 1 cent, and April remained unchanged. (16th) Chicago wheat initially rose due to purchases from the East, but later fell due to the influence of 玉蜀 (yu shu) (corn) and profit-taking by bullish investors. A total of 20 million bushels were traded on the 14th. The market prices for the 16th are listed below:</p>
<p>Closing Price Compared to Previous Day</p>
<p>May Futures 46.875 down 0.875</p>
<p>July Futures 47.000 down 0.500</p>
<p>September Futures 47.875 down 0.25</p>
<h3 id="e225">Soybean Market Increases, Then Slumps <a href="#e225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>The high-quality soybean market is stable, and sales continue to be good. Market conditions have been stable recently, with consistent increases and decreases. The market appears to be preparing for a new year rally. Yesterday, three cars of Southern Suzhou soybeans were traded, all for immediate delivery. Three cars of Dingjia State and Zhengyangguan soybeans were purchased by inland oil mills. Two hundred bags of Chongming Sand soybeans were sold off and purchased by local dealers. Two hundred and seventy bags of Xuzhou white beans were traded at steady prices. One hundred bags of raw peanuts were sold, with prices increasing and then slumping. The oil market continued to rise, but the gains were not strong, only fluctuating by a small amount. A London dispatch from the 16th reported that soybean oil was unchanged, soybeans were priced at 7 pounds per ton, and rapeseed oil was priced at 29.0 per 120 pounds.</p>
<p>Sugar Market</p>
<h3 id="e226">Chaoqing Continues to Arrive, Over a Thousand Bags <a href="#e226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>Offer Prices Show No Sign of Loosening</p>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market had good sentiment at the initial opening due to firmer標金 (biao jin) (benchmark prices), but failed to rise further due to limited purchases. The Guild set the price for No. 24 coarse white sugar at 15.8 taels, but there were few takers. It was later traded at 15.75 taels per 100 bags. The price for No. 20 medium white sugar was slightly lower, set at 15.325 taels. A Jian dealer continued to offer 100 bags of 刁靑 (diao qing) (high-quality sugar) at 9.5 taels. According to the letter, the cost of Chaoqing, which arrived from Shantou on the Taikoo ship Suiyang, is above 9 taels. It is said that dealers are unwilling to loosen prices further before the end of the settlement period.</p>
<p>According to New York telegrams, spot prices fell slightly by 0.03125 to 7.1875 cents. Futures for March fell slightly by 3 points to 6.5 cents, December fell slightly by 1 point to 8.3 cents, and the remaining months fell slightly by 2 points. January was at 6.7 cents, May at 7 cents, July at 7.4 cents, and September at 7.8 cents. London sugar futures fell by 1 penny to 4.225 for March, fell by 1.25 pennies to 5.50 for May, and fell by 1.25 pennies to 5.350 for August (per 120 pounds). Java white sugar was unchanged at 7 shillings and 9 pence.</p>
<p>Metals</p>
<h3 id="e227">Overseas Prices Rising <a href="#e227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>Tianjin and Qingdao Merchants Returning North</p>
<p>Metal trading is very slow because of the closure of the lunar year and the winding up of accounts by customer groups and factories. Many of the Tianjin, Qingdao, and other groups are returning north because of port closures and rampant rumours in their local areas, further depopulating the market. Prices are virtually unchanged because of minuscule levels of imports and exports, but news that overseas prices have risen continuously for several days is helping stabilize market sentiment and generate price optimism. Items such as tinplate, plain iron, galvanized iron, and corrugated iron all show a bullish trend.</p>
<p>Overseas telegrams from London and New York report that the price of first-grade tinplate has risen by 0.1125. There is still no available tin, as there are very few transactions in first-grade tinplate. A London telegram from the 16th reports that the prices of copper, tin, and zinc have fallen, while lead has risen slightly, and antimony and tungsten are unchanged. The same day, a New York telegram reports that the price of No. 2 pig iron is $12.5 per ton, No. 24 black iron sheet (per 100 pounds) is $2.05, No. 24 white iron sheet is $1.80, and tinplate is $4.25 per box.</p>

<p>Africa, Once Exclusively Occupied by Chinese Tea...Japanese Tea Has Made a Head-On Collision</p>
<p>In addition to strictly inspecting for adulteration, coloring, and other malpractices in tea destined for foreign countries, the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau of the Ministry of Industry also publishes monthly sales figures and export quantities to provide a reference for the tea industry. The full-year report for the 21st year has now been completed. Although this report only refers to direct exports from Shanghai and transshipments from Hankou and other ports, Shanghai and Hankou have now become the two major markets for Chinese tea exports. The figures contained in this report account for more than three-quarters of total exports. The export figures are as follows:</p>

<p>Total 228,247.80 76,522.50 226,809.55 7,894.09</p>
<p>According to the total figures in the table above, exports to Russia are the highest, followed by Africa, and then the United States and the United Kingdom. Most of the Russian figures are brick tea, while the combined amount of green tea and black tea, which used to be important, is now less than 10,000 dan. This is due to the leading sales of Indian black tea and Japanese green tea, as well as Russia's self-cultivation of tea in recent years. (Chinese black tea exports to Russia reached a maximum of 400,000 dan, and green tea was about 150,000 dan). The United Kingdom has historically been the largest market for Chinese tea exports, with black tea reaching a maximum of 1 million dan, and green tea being less, around 80,000 to 90,000 dan. Last year, the total amount of black and green tea was less than 30,000 dan, a decrease of two-thirds compared to the peak period. Although Africa has seen a slight increase, last year it was also affected by the dumping of Japanese tea. Japanese green tea began to be imported into Africa in 1931, but the quantity at that time was only 15,000 pounds. By the end of November last year, it had jumped to over 500,000 pounds. This year, it will inevitably engage in a head-on collision with Chinese tea. In the past two years, the total number of Chinese tea exports has largely been maintained, but prices have also decreased by about one-third. The future of Chinese tea is truly heartbreaking.</p>

<p>— Xingjuan</p>
<p>After a while, some dowry items were chosen and taken away. I said, this definitely isn't a good person!</p>
<p>A few days later, that young fellow came again. I ignored him, but the master eagerly went to entertain him.</p>
<p>First, he chatted with the master in a familiar, disrespectful way. Then, I saw him lean close to the master's ear, whispering some secret, devilish things!</p>
<p>But the master's smiling face immediately turned serious, and he repeatedly shook his head.</p>
<p>The young fellow seemed very unhappy and left.</p>
<p>The next morning, as the sun rose, the master again carried a string of shovels, chisels,... to the street to sell.</p>
<p>The sun shone into his shop. My junior sister and I were playing with coins. The master didn't return.</p>
<p>The sun shone directly on the center of the street. After Ah Zhen and I ate lunch, the master didn't return.</p>
<p>The sun shone past the house across the street. Ah Zhen and I sat at the door waiting. The master didn't return.</p>
<p>The sun set. Ah Qi, the wonton seller from Gaodun, ran in, panting and covered in sweat! He said our master had stolen a pair of gold bracelets from the Chun Tai-ye family and had been arrested by the officials! The master said Da Mao should manage the shop and Ah Zhen should go quickly, otherwise, he would be killed!</p>
<p>Ah Zhen cried out and ran off with Ah Qi like she was flying. I was like a lost bean, unable to decide what to do, my heart burning like red iron...</p>
<p>The first night, the moon hung in the sky, and I wandered in circles in the moonlight! Alone.</p>
<p>The second night, the moon hung in the sky, and I wandered in circles in the moonlight! Alone.</p>
<p>The third night, the master came back. I asked, "Where's junior sister!" The master ignored me, his eyes fixed on the empty space with anger. The moon hung in the sky, and he wandered in circles in the moonlight. The master shed tears in the moonlight. Two people.</p>
<p>From then on, the master no longer went to the streets to sell. He let the business in our shop decline day by day. He spent all the money he earned each day on baijiu, drinking himself into a drunken stupor, and then tried to beat me with a large hammer. He didn't even think that I had been hungry for days and hadn't had a good meal! I wanted to leave, but I was worried about my junior sister. I dreamed of my junior sister returning every day, but when I woke up, it was all empty! My heart, my body, my whole being was filled with pain!</p>
<p>I thought, junior sister should come back, right? Oh, then I'd be really happy! But day after day, month after month, I never saw her return.</p>
<p>In some dreams, I saw her in that old thief Chun Daye's house, dressed like a courtesan. In other dreams, I saw her being devoured alive by a wolf, so pitiful! I didn't dare to think about it. Whenever I thought about it, tears fell like rain.</p>
<p>Junior sister should come back, right?</p>
<p>These days are truly unbearable! (The End)</p>
<h3 id="e255">Release Peace <a href="#e255" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c255" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">255</a></h3>
<p>— Xianju</p>
<p>I remember when the European War ended, a celebration meeting was held in Beijing. Mr. Cai Yuanpei gave a speech, saying in essence that justice had triumphed over might, and from then on, the world could embark on a path of peace. The historical facts at home and abroad over the past ten years have proven that Mr. Cai's "peace" dream at that time was ultimately just a "fantasy" of a flower in a mirror and the moon in the water.</p>
<p>However, now, our country, from the court to the common people, is still dreaming this kind of peaceful fantasy. What exactly is the content of peace? Because the interests of each social stratum are different, there are also different interpretations. Generally speaking, there are roughly three points:</p>
<p>1.  The peace of the strong. The tiger said to the sheep, "I am extremely fond of peace. As long as you don't resist, my appetite is limited. After I eat my fill every day, I will naturally shut up. Your remaining lives will also get a considerable amount of peace." This is the kind of peace that imperialists demand from weak nations and warlords demand from oppressed groups.</p>
<p>2.  The peace of the weak. The psychology of the weak is a psychology of clinging to life and fearing death. They dare not offer the slightest resistance to the insults and slaughter of aggressors and oppressors, but they are unwilling to openly write the "cross" of surrender. Therefore, they shout peace at the strong. This peace is "shameful servility" kowtowing beneath the enemy's bayonets. It is a shameless peace. Shameless peace and the unreasonable peace of the strong are both the great enemies of true human peace, and we should use all our strength to smash them.</p>
<p>3.  True peace is built on the foundation of equality and freedom for all people, not on the foundation of the strong bullying the weak and the rich oppressing the poor. In this kingdom of peace, not only is there political equality and freedom, but there is also economic equality and freedom. The problems of everyone are not forced by the so-called laws and force of a few powerful people on one side, but are adjusted by the conventions of the social labor organization. During the transition period from the existing system to the true kingdom of peace, there is naturally still a need to replace the coercive laws and force of a minority with the coercive laws and force of the majority. But this is a necessary means to get on the road to true peace and naturally cannot be said to be a destruction of peace.</p>

<p>— Yu Dafu</p>
<p>(1)</p>
<p>Freedom of speech is still out of the question in China. According to the declaration of the China League for Civil Rights, "The civil rights demanded by the Chinese people through revolutionary sacrifices have not yet been realized, which is most distressing. Records of suppressing public opinion and illegal arrests and killings are common in newspapers; even young men and women are sometimes suspected of being political prisoners and are inevitably subjected to secret military trials." Judging from this, the right to personal freedom (Habeas Corpus) given to the people in Europe during the Dark Ages has still not been obtained in China. It was the same when King Li of Zhou and Qin Shi Huang were in power three or four thousand years ago, and it is still the same now, three or four thousand years after the success of the revolution. May I ask, if a person cannot even maintain the safety of their own body, then what is there to say about freedom of speech? People without freedom of speech can exist, but can there be a kind of person without a body in this world?</p>
<p>The British novelist Compton Mackenzie was recently fined two thousand yuan for writing a memoir that leaked secrets from when he served as a British intelligence agent in Greece during the Great War. Fortunately, this happened in England, the cradle of liberalism, so C.M.'s head was saved. If it had happened in China, everyone can imagine what the outcome would have been like? George Bernard Shaw, relying on his age and experience, said that England could abandon India, but only received a warning from the colonial governor. Imagine what the ending would have been like if this had happened in China.</p>
<p>Therefore, I feel that in today's China, advocating and striving for freedom of speech is still a luxury for those who advocate it.</p>

<p>Mr. Wang Weizi asked for an inscription for a painting of an autumn wind on horseback by Chen Zihe. It has been two or three months since I handed in my assignment. Now, I occasionally flip through my diary and see this matter, so I came up with four crooked poems.</p>
<p>A picture of youthful frustration, with remnant mountains and waters vaguely recognized; the autumn wind on horseback over Xianxia Ridge, carries the boat girl of the nine surnames, no?</p>
<p>Because he was returning from Fujian in frustration at the time, he thought of Bao Zhupo's Jiangshan boat. This story comes from Li Chunke's diary.</p>
<h3 id="e257">On the Various Customs of Celebrating the New Year in My Hometown <a href="#e257" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c257" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">257</a></h3>
<p>— Dasheng</p>
<p>It has been snowing heavily for the past few days, creating quite a scene of the end of winter. According to the calendar, today should be the twenty-third day of the twelfth lunar month. Although my footprints have been like duckweed for several years, and the so-called "auspicious occasions" can no longer stir up "poetic feelings" in the heart of a wanderer, I often feel a sense of longing whenever I think of the customs around the New Year in my hometown and the games of the children. "I ask, do the sand and dust of my hometown still cover the footprints of my youth?" Thinking of this often makes me feel desolate!</p>
<p>× × × × ×</p>
<p>My hometown is on the banks of Dongting Lake in Hunan. In my hometown, after today, tomorrow (the twenty-fourth) is called "Little New Year." On the evening of the Little New Year, it is said that the Kitchen God goes to heaven to report the good and evil deeds of this family, so every family must worship the Kitchen God that night and burn a memorial written on yellow paper at the stove, asking him to say a few good words for this family when he reports to the Heavenly Court. However, it is impossible to know whether the Kitchen God accepts this sweet talk and bribery. Probably the Kitchen God has become smarter this year.</p>
<p>After the Little New Year, the New Year is really getting closer and closer. Mothers have to warn their children not to cry and not to talk too much, and they especially forbid the use of unlucky words such as "death," "ghost," and "bad luck." Children are constantly craning their necks, hoping that the New Year will come soon. "Adults look forward to transplanting rice seedlings, and children look forward to celebrating the New Year." These words vividly portray the different mentalities of adults and children, and at the same time describe the sorrow of adults.</p>
<p>The last day of the twelfth month is called New Year's Eve. On New Year's Eve, the whole family has to "stay up all night," and the incense candles in front of the spirits are kept burning all night long. When the rooster crows and the east is about to dawn, the situation becomes more and more tense. Everyone deliberately puts on a happy face and doesn't talk much. They light torches and prepare firecrackers. The whole family prepares to go out. The ritual of going out is to open the door, first the head of the family bows to the vast and boundless heavens and earth, and then they set off the firecrackers with a crackling sound. The longer the firecrackers are set off, the more it shows the wealth of this family. After setting off the firecrackers, they happily go home. Some even carry back a large pile of firewood, which is meant to symbolize "bringing wealth home."</p>
<p>As soon as they enter the door, everyone is busy "wishing each other a happy New Year." Naturally, the younger generation starts by wishing the elders a happy New Year, kowtowing and bowing. If there are many people in this family, then you bow to me, I bow to you, and you have to say "Congratulations, congratulations" in your mouth, making a mess. This is really an extremely interesting drama. After the family has paid their respects, they then pay their respects to the neighbors on the left and right, and then to relatives and friends in distant places. When I was at home, I was most afraid of this routine.</p>
<p>From the first day of the first lunar month to the fifteenth, everyone doesn't work. Some play cards, some play with dragons, play with lanterns, or play with lions. Everyone probably knows about playing with dragons and playing with lions. As for playing with lanterns, it's also similar to the variety shows in Shanghai's Great World. A young man and a young woman sing some lyrics and songs about flirting between men and women. There are also many very good ones, but unfortunately I can't remember them all.</p>
<p>The evening of the fifteenth is called the Lantern Festival, and the children play the game of "Welcoming the Seventh Sister." The Seventh Sister is also called "Lipo," and the children revere her as a goddess, saying that she can divine good and bad fortune. The method of welcoming the Seventh Sister is to wrap a bamboo chopstick and a flower around a bamboo sieve, and then put some rice in a plate and insert one end of the bamboo chopstick into the rice. Two unmarried girls each lift the bamboo sieve with one finger, constantly chanting incantations. When the Seventh Sister comes, the chopstick on the bamboo sieve draws words on the rice, and then the people standing quietly next to them are busy asking about longevity and the year's fortunes. The incantation is the most interesting. "The first month is the first month, all the grass is green. Please Seventh Sister, ask about the year's fortunes. Ask about the year's fortunes, whether it's true or false, ask about the year's fortunes, whether it's false or true. On the fifteenth day of the first month, there are bustling flower lanterns, and the flower lanterns are spinning around. Swing on the tree..."</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I can't remember it completely, I only remember this much.</p>

<p>— Zhang Ziping</p>
<p>"What exactly is your relationship with them?"</p>
<p>Hearing Madame Hezi say that she didn't care about them, he couldn't help but cheer up, and his attitude changed, asking her gently, "You can't tell me?"</p>
<p>She had just eaten a piece of bread and answered him shyly. After saying that, she smiled with a blush.</p>
<p>Her attitude aroused another wave of suspicion in his heart. The fire of jealousy is more violent than any kind of flame. Indeed, his face turned green again.</p>
<p>"Is he your old flame from before?"</p>
<p>He asked her in Cantonese, jokingly.</p>
<p>"Oh my, Mr. Lin looks down on people too much! If he were my old flame, would I dare let him come here? He wouldn't let me just sit in your room, would he?"</p>
<p>After she said that, she burst out laughing. Haiquan felt that what she said made sense and couldn't help but blush.</p>
<p>"The weather is nice today, Mr. Lin, how about going for a walk in the suburbs? Pincinc!"</p>
<p>"Let's go in the afternoon."</p>
<p>He couldn't deny the love between them no matter what. And he also felt that he couldn't leave her during this period. Leaving her would mean tasting the bitterness of loneliness. As long as he didn't touch on concrete issues, he would maintain a special friendship with this woman of a different race. He suddenly expressed his compromise again.</p>
<p>"Why not take a day off? Such good weather. Such a beautiful day, how many times do we have that in life? What does a day's work count for?" she said with a smile. He thought, this is clearly a temptation.</p>
<p>"I have an important letter to deliver to the school."</p>
<p>"Why not just mail it with a two-cent stamp?"</p>
<p>"It's an important letter."</p>
<p>This was a letter of recommendation that Zhuo Shuhua had asked him to get from Ren Shushi, recommending her brother to work in the ×× bureau. Last night, he had dinner at Ren's house. Because of this matter, he felt it was very inconvenient to mention it to Ren Jinhua. It was only later that Mrs. Ren and her husband indirectly said it. Haiquan really didn't expect that Ren Shushi would readily agree to his request and specially wrote this letter of recommendation for him. At that time, he really had an unspeakable gratitude. Because he was holding this letter, he could brag to Zhuo Shuhua even more.</p>
<p>"You can register the important letter."</p>
<p>"Then send it by express mail."</p>
<p>Haiquan agreed to accompany her out, first to the post office to send the express mail, and then to the park for a stroll.</p>
<p>"Thank you so much, Mr. Lin!"</p>
<p>She said this time in Japanese, bowing to Haiquan with a smile.</p>

<h3 id="e259">On Treason <a href="#e259" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c259" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">259</a></h3>
<p>— Wu</p>
<p>The matter of treason may not seem so high-sounding, but now that we have reached the point where "everyone is selling the country," it is also worthy of discussion.</p>
<p>Originally, treason does not necessarily incur any major penalties, especially when the country is no longer a country and one cannot enjoy the slightest protection from this country, so it is better to sell it off and let everyone taste the true taste of being a slave to a conquered nation. Perhaps this is the ultimate goal of the kind and virtuous descendants of the Yellow Emperor. However, treason is not an easy task, and not every ordinary person can do it, because all the powerful figures are already engaged in wholesale and retail, and we small and petty patriots have no chance to skim any oil. But doesn't this seem unreasonable? We are all people of a ancient country of more than four thousand years, and we have the right to sell our country. How can you few people handle it all? Thinking about it, I feel resentful, so we must fight for this right to sell our country. Moreover, the art of treason also needs to be studied. As for our art of treason, it's not bad either. When we buy and sell inferior goods, we still say "I dare not lag behind others in loving the country." Under the banner of "long-term resistance," we certainly don't need to organize volunteer troops. In order to learn the skills of being slaves to a conquered nation, we might as well have a few sets of "dancing to save the country," "artistic performances to save the country," "art to save the country," and "entertainment to save the country" to make others forget the national crisis. Our doctors, scholars, and celebrities, in order to keep their positions as "ministers of a conquered nation," might as well strongly support the Lytton Report. Our literati and officials, in order to prevent the people from truly expanding the national war and hindering their treasonous business, are vigorously promoting "internal pacification." Our artists, fearing that the country will not be destroyed, keep repeating the old tune of "art for art's sake."</p>
<p>Looking at it this way, it is no longer a question of whether China should be sold off. It's just that everyone is striving to work hard to sell the country, seeing who can achieve great success in it. Only the Northeast Volunteer Army in the frozen land does not understand the benefits of treason and desperately fights the imperialists, and also hopes that the generous philanthropists in Guannei who are enthusiastic about selling the country will provide material assistance. This is truly excellent and outstanding.</p>

<h3 id="e260">How Records are Made <a href="#e260" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c260" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">260</a></h3>
<p>— Zhong Sheng</p>
<p>Everyone knows that the phonograph and records were invented by the American inventor Thomas Edison. But Edison's original method was very incomplete. It took a long time of improvement to reach the perfect state it is in now!</p>
<p>At first, the method of making records invented by Edison was called the "horn-style recording method." The method is to place a "sound box" (Sound Box) at the rear end of a metal horn; this sound box has a thin mica film attached to it. Therefore, the music and vocal sounds played outside the horn are collected in the horn tube, directly causing the film to vibrate: the film then transmits its vibration to a steel gauge, and the steel needle engraves the sound waves on the rotating wax plate.</p>
<p>However, this method is very incomplete. First, the vibration frequency of sounds emitted by humans is usually about 26 to 1,700 cycles per second, while the vibration frequency of sounds played by musical instruments is about 30 to 7,000 cycles per second. As for the vibration frequency of sounds that people's ears can hear, it is 30 to 20,000 cycles per second. However, the sound waves that this horn-style recording method can collect are only 300 to 2,500 cycles per second: no matter how good the vibrating membrane is, it can only collect 80 to 4,000 cycles of sound waves. Second, during recording, the sound quality can change due to the horn's reverberation. Third, when recording sound waves, the vibrating membrane and the wax plate will generate resistance, so the recorded sound waves in a certain range will become weaker, and even recorded as being very different from the original sound. Fourth, therefore, the sounds emitted by low-pitched instruments are very difficult to record. In short, records made using the horn-style recording method are not very perfect and cannot be regarded as a reproduction of the original sound. They are just a kind of flat "canned sound" that is more similar to the original sound.</p>
<p>Later, after joint research by the American Victor company and the Western Electric company, in 1924, they completed a kind of "electrical recording method." This method uses a "vacuum tube amplification device," and this method can collect all the sounds that human hearing can sense. As a result, the horn-style recording method became a past "relic of the scientific world!"</p>
<p>This electrical recording method does not use a horn, but instead uses a "microphone" (Microphone). The recording of sound waves must go through the following sequence: (1) microphone (2) amplifier (Amplifier) (3) electrical recording machine (Electric Recorder) (4) wax plate (Wax Plate).</p>
<p>Initially, the sound of the human throat or the music from musical instruments is sensed by the microphone, and the sound waves are transformed into electrical waves: but these electrical waves are very thin and weak and are not enough to vibrate the recording machine, so they must first be transmitted to the amplifier to "amplify" them into electrical waves millions of times stronger: these amplified electrical waves act on the recording machine and are then converted back into the original sound waves, causing the jewel-made recording needle to vibrate, engraving the dense sound waves on the rotating wax plate. The wax plate made in this way is called a "recording wax plate" (Plate Recording Wax Plate).</p>
<p>Next, a mixed coating is applied to the surface of the recording wax plate to make it an electrical conductor, and it is immersed in a copper electrolytic bath, and its surface is electroplated with copper until the plated copper plate is about one thirty-second of an inch thick. Then it is taken out of the bath, and the plated copper plate is separated from the wax plate, so the sound wave recording on the wax plate is copied very accurately onto the copper plate. This is called the "father master" (Original Master).</p>
<p>After the father master is made, another "mother master" must be made using the father master as a model. The method is to first apply a release solution to the surface of the father master, and then immerse it in a nickel (Nickel) electrolytic bath for about an hour, then its surface will be plated with a layer of nickel. Then immerse it in a copper electrolyte solution and plate a layer of copper plate on the back of the nickel surface. Then it is taken out of the electrolytic bath, and the two cast plates are peeled off, then the new cast plate with a nickel surface is the "mother master" (Mother). This mother master can reproduce the original sound on the phonograph just like an ordinary record. Although I have not seen the records of the Chinese recording company, maybe they are the kind of "mother master" items.</p>
<p>After the mother master is made, a release solution is applied to its surface and a thin layer of nickel is plated: then it is placed in a copper electrolytic deep liquid and a copper layer is plated. Then take it out and peel off the two sides, nail a copper plate to the back of the new cast plate, and then cut it into the shape of an ordinary record; this is called the "stamper" (Stanper). What is printed with this stamper is the record we use: so if this stamper has some small marks, a new stamper must be made from the mother master using the above method, otherwise the printed record will not be perfect.</p>
<p>The raw materials for ordinary records are shellac rubber, (Carbo Black), and other filling materials produced in India, the Americas, and the East Indies. These raw materials must first be crushed, heated, and refined into a rectangular block using special crushing machines and mixers. This is called a (Biscuit), and each block is just right for printing a record. This raw material is placed on a steam heating plate to make it soft, and then placed between the original plate A and B, and squeezed and cooled, then it becomes an ordinary record.</p>
<p>But before the records are sold, they must first undergo precise listening tests. The first twenty-five records printed from each type must be completely free of defects before they can pass: otherwise, the stamper has defects, so a new stamper must be cast from the mother master.</p>

<p>The success of a difficult undertaking is built on the foundation of a fearless spirit.</p>
<p>Struggle is the key to being a final victor. Inventor Edison and explorer Amundsen are all successful strugglers. Learning and seeking knowledge is like entering the mountains to collect medicine. Without going through deep mountain ravines and rugged roads, there will be no good results.</p>
<p>Hanging plaques with artistic light in dance halls is like writing "clean and hygienic" in the toilet.</p>
<p>Human desires are endless.</p>
<p>A person must first prepare and then do.</p>
<p>How can we move forward? Passive. Discouraged. The road to success. Sure.</p>
<p>If you do it first and then prepare, you'll mess it up.</p>
<p>It's better not to do things that have no results. You must think before you act, so you don't make mistakes.</p>
<p>Patience is a sign of weakness, so patient people lack perseverance.</p>
<p>The Chinese have ended up in this state today because their family concept is too deep.</p>
<p>It is useless to shout slogans and write slogans. Actual work depends entirely on hands and feet.</p>
<p>Relying on others means losing your independence. To maintain your independence, you must ultimately rely on yourself!</p>

<p>After eating lunch, it was almost two o'clock in the morning light, and the class bell rang three times. I, who was playing ping-pong in the game room, heard the class bell and quickly put down my paddle and rushed to the classroom.</p>
<p>When I arrived in the classroom, was I the last one? Just as I sat down, Professor C, with his neatly trimmed mustache and air of a "wooden clogs"派, seemed to be following in my footsteps, standing on the podium.</p>
<p>Professor C adjusted himself, then opened his only treasured leather bag, took out more than fifty test papers, and asked Yang X, the leader of the 善武派, to distribute them. He gave a few words in a sermon-like manner, left the podium, and, with his eyes like car headlights, began his rounds as inspector.</p>
<p>"That annoying Chinese language class, I haven't come up with a single sentence yet. I'm afraid it'll be hard to hand in the paper today?" said Chen, nicknamed "Dancing Doctor," and Li, "King of the Bulletin Board."</p>
<p>"Look! Isn't my paper the same as yours? This kind of sly先生 didn't tell us in advance, so we didn't have time to prepare."</p>
<p>"There are only fifteen minutes left! Hurry up and do it. The sooner you hand in the paper, the more points you'll get." Professor C heard them talking and deliberately walked closer to them, saying this to them.</p>
<p>"I can't hand in the paper today. I'll hand it in to you tomorrow. I'm going to fail this semester anyway," said "Dancing Doctor" Chen with a hint of affected pride.</p>
<p>Miss Fan, known for her 校花名, also said to Professor C:</p>
<p>"Professor, today's difficult questions really make it difficult for us to hand in the paper. Let's just wait until tomorrow to hand it in."</p>
<p>"How can that be! The dean has already told me that this exam should be especially strict. If you don't hand in the paper today, won't I have to listen to his complaints?"</p>
<p>"Then, can we hand in a blank paper?"</p>
<p>"Well, you still have to write a few sentences so I can give an account of it," Professor C said, then walked back to the podium.</p>
<p>"Ding, ding, ding!" We heard the end-of-class bell ring, as if escaping from a cage. Everyone walked up to Professor C and asked in unison:</p>
<p>"Hand in the papers at five o'clock."</p>
<p>Professor C had no choice but to slip outside with his leather bag.</p>

<h3 id="e265">How to Reform the Social System? <a href="#e265" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c265" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">265</a></h3>
<p>Editor:</p>
<p>Since the publication of my humble work "How to Avenge an Old Friend," I have received your sympathy and guidance. I am also grateful to Mr. 湼 and Mr. Xiong for proposing solutions to the unfortunate encounter of my old friend, Mr. Pan. The plight of my old friend Pan has aroused so much sympathy, which I did not expect!</p>
<p>The dead are gone! The living are unbearable! We should further consider the plight of the exploited, such as Pan, who are still living. As Mr. 湼 said: "It is no longer limited to the problem of individuals, but should be extended to how to reform the social system." I feel that before the entire society is reformed, all individual problems cannot be addressed. We cannot simply curse society, nor should we sit and wait for others to reform society and then let us enjoy the fruits. Every member of society has the mission of transforming society.</p>
<p>However, the question of "how to reform society" cannot be solved by the intellect of one person alone. It must be discussed and studied by the masses before a satisfactory conclusion can be reached. Due to space limitations, I can only outline my views for readers to study and discuss, and I ask the editor to provide guidance.</p>
<p>(1) The Changes in Chinese Society After the Opium War...丨 Before the Opium War, China was a self-sufficient feudal society. Closed off from the world, it could be called a "small well-off." After the Opium War, capitalist countries, after using cannons to invade, continued to invade with a flood of commodities, destroying all the old systems of the rural economy. Whether in economics, politics, ideology, or class relations, dramatic changes occurred. Moreover, because of the impact of imperialist aggression, it not only could not extricate itself but even became a quasi-colonial state.</p>
<p>(2) The Two Major Crises of China's Social Economy: (A) The Abnormal Development of Cities, 丨 Years of banditry, floods, droughts, and foreign agricultural products have accelerated the bankruptcy of rural areas, driving people to concentrate in cities, forming an abnormal development of cities; (B) All major industries, such as railways, shipping, banking, and mining, are in the hands of foreigners; and there is an excess of imports of about one hundred million yuan each year, leading to the danger of economic bankruptcy.</p>
<p>(3) Political Crisis 丨 Imperialist powers, in order to solve their own problems, have had to desperately seize China's rights and interests. The recent Northeast Incident is one example. (4) China's Way Out 丨 To seek a way out for China, it is necessary to remedy the above-mentioned economic and political crises. It is necessary to actively oppose imperialism, get rid of the shackles of imperialism, and expel imperialist forces in China (all economic and political forces). Then China can be unified, and national capital can develop. The first step in anti-imperialism, of course, is to resist Japan and gather the strength of the entire nation to implement resistance against Japan! In short, China cannot get rid of the shackles of imperialism, and the social system cannot be reformed.</p>
<p>This is our vital issue. We hope that readers will enthusiastically participate in the discussion, and we ask the editor to provide guidance. Respectfully, Gu Zhongjie.</p>
<p>January 10 X X X X</p>
<p>Editor's Note: Mr. Gu's letter speaks eloquently about the reasons for China's social ills. The proposed improvement methods are not without merit. However, we believe that the issue of "transforming society" is very broad and complex, with thousands of strands, and cannot be solved with a few words. The far-sighted Premier spent forty or fifty years of research and personally drafted the Three Principles of the People, inventing this all-encompassing, all-inclusive doctrine for saving the country.</p>
<p>In terms of getting rid of the shackles of imperialists, there is nationalism.</p>
<p>In terms of stabilizing society and eliminating man-made disasters, there is democracy.</p>
<p>In terms of stabilizing the economy, developing capital, and revitalizing rural areas, there is the Principle of People's Livelihood. Great are the Three Principles of the People! Those who have the responsibility to improve society, deeply understand them and strive to implement them!</p>

<h3 id="e267">Temptation <a href="#e267" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c267" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">267</a></h3>
<p>— Translated by Gao Zhixiang, written by E.V. Lucas</p>
<p>"Temptation" is a topic that cannot be discussed frankly in front of acquaintances and strangers alike. However, from this very vague conversation, we can also glean quite a bit of interesting humor.</p>
<p>"My greatest temptation," said a beautiful woman, "was discovered last winter, when I was staying at a not-very-satisfactory hotel by the sea in 立拂來. I was very surprised why I spent so much time there. It turned out I came to get away from the freezing weather, you understand the meaning of that, right?"</p>
<p>Everyone seemed to understand.</p>
<p>"After I had been there for a few days, one evening, some friends from the nearby village invited me to dinner. I happily put on a few fashionable outfits I had bought when I passed through Paris, anticipating getting a lot of compliments then. But, I had to wear my rings, and all the pleasant fantasies vanished. I had a few distinctive rings, so I instructed the maid—she was newly hired—to bring me those rings."</p>
<p>"She took out a few and placed them on the table."</p>
<p>"'No,' I said, 'not those, I want the ones with the emeralds and rubies.'"</p>
<p>"'They're all here,' she said."</p>
<p>"'All here!' I shouted, 'What do you mean? Are the emerald and ruby ones not there? What about the diamond earrings?'"</p>
<p>There was no trace of those things!</p>
<p>I fainted. I thought, this seems to be the fate in this world. Everyone will inevitably encounter a theft sooner or later, but I had never encountered it before.</p>
<p>"Luckily, they were already insured, but I really liked them, so I was very annoyed."</p>
<p>"I and the maid repeatedly, over and over again, checked the jewelry box, searching all possible places, or perhaps possible places. Then I went to report it to the hotel manager."</p>
<p>"He was very polite. He questioned me, but he absolutely didn't believe that such a theft could happen in his place. He asked me if I really brought them—because women are often forgetful."</p>
<p>"'Yes, I definitely brought them.'"</p>
<p>"'Don't you have any suspicions?' he said, glancing at the maid."</p>
<p>"'I believe that the thief must be an outsider.'"</p>
<p>"'But according to our hotel regulations, customers must hand over their valuables to the cashier for safekeeping. But even so, I will do my best to help. If you can give me a detailed list of the lost items, I will report it to the police.'"</p>
<p>"Therefore, I gave a very detailed description of the stolen rings, and then, very troubled and disappointed, I went to the banquet."</p>
<p>"The next day, I saw many policemen constantly coming. The poor maid was interrogated again and again. I felt that every servant there resented me, because of me, they were under suspicion."</p>
<p>"But after questioning, there were no results. The trail of the theft was never found. I hurried back to London, reported it to the insurance company, and entrusted everything to them."</p>
<p>"When many visitors came to inquire, I said that the most grateful people in the world, besides the police—who often return our lost umbrellas to us—are the insurance company employees, because I had already received a check to compensate for the rings, and that was the end of the matter."</p>
<p>Her words stopped.</p>
<p>"'But where is the temptation?' several people in the room asked."</p>
<p>"'I'll continue,' she said, 'The check was mailed in the afternoon. The next day, I went to the bank to deposit it and also to check the safe deposit box stored in the bank.'"</p>
<p>The beautiful lady's words stopped again.</p>
<p>"'What happened?' many people asked."</p>
<p>"'Well,' she said, 'the bank clerk handed me the safe deposit box in the reception room. I opened it—'"</p>
<p>"And the first thing I found was one of the lost rings. The rest were also inside."</p>
<p>"'Ah!' someone in the room shouted."</p>
<p>"'Yes, those things were all stored in the box. Before I went to 立拂來, I had put them away very carefully. But, it was only then that I suddenly remembered. People are often fooled by memory. It's really mysterious. Memory often fails people.'"</p>
<p>"'Now you understand the "temptation," right?' she said, 'On the way home, the "temptation" surrounded me. No one but me knew the truth about the rings. Even the insurance company would never find out. If I were dishonest, I could have the rings and still get a sum of compensation.'" She stopped speaking again.</p>
<p>"'Really!' someone in the room said, and there was silence for a long time.</p>
<p>In every gathering, whether large or small, there is bound to be such a fool who, when everyone understands and is silent, still sincerely asks without thinking, "What did you do?"</p>

<h3 id="e268">Laughable Actions in Art Knowledge Slapstick Films <a href="#e268" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c268" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">268</a></h3>
<p>— Chi Zhao</p>
<p>For a film to be considered a slapstick comedy, besides the funny dialogue in the sound era, there are also the laughable actions. Based on my personal observation, the actions that are meant to be funny in many slapstick films can be summarized into the following types:</p>
<p>(1) Playing Dumb: Dumb people are funny, so actors in slapstick films often deliberately act stupidly to make the audience laugh. For example, a comedic character goes to play the piano, but the piano and the chair are too far apart. A normal person would just pull the light chair over, but he has to use all his strength to move the heavy piano closer to the chair. You think, wouldn't this kind of action cause the self-proclaimed intelligent viewers to burst into laughter?</p>
<p>(2) Faking: Faking is also a material that makes people laugh. In slapstick films, a fake action is like a comedic character scaring away a group of robbers with a pistol in his pocket. But, after the group of robbers leaves, he takes the pistol out of his pocket, peels off the skin leisurely and carelessly, revealing the snow-white flesh and chewing it in his mouth. It turns out his pistol is a banana. At that time, the audience will always smile knowingly!</p>
<p>(3) Opposite: Opposite can also be said to be incongruous. When a tall person and a short person stand together, you will laugh at their incongruity. When a big fat person and a thin person bump into each other, you will also laugh at their incongruity. When one person is furious and the other is slow and methodical, you will always find it ridiculous. For example, in the film "葛洛克," when 葛洛克 comes to the stage carrying a large suitcase, he takes out the smallest violin from that large suitcase without any surprise. The audience with keen senses can't help but laugh.</p>
<p>(4) Mistake: It is really funny when someone makes a big mistake while doing something. If you see someone eating a banana without peeling it and eating it with the peel, you will always spread that person as a joke. For example, in the film "Old Soldier," the thin Laurel wants to cut out the advertisement for fertilizer powder in the newspaper. He puts the newspaper on a leather chair and uses a knife to cut the advertisement out. The advertisement is cut out, but he also cuts out a piece of the leather surface of the chair the size of the advertisement. When the audience sees this kind of mistaken action, they will naturally burst into laughter.</p>
<p>The above four types of laughable actions are just what I have observed personally. In addition to these four types, there are certainly many others in slapstick films. However, these four types are commonly seen, and for each of the four types, I have only given one example to generalize the others. Omissions are unavoidable.</p>

<h3 id="e269">Dietrich's Problems <a href="#e269" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c269" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">269</a></h3>
<p>— Yi Hua</p>
<p>Hollywood is now very eagerly discussing Marlene Dietrich's problems. Because her contract with Paramount Pictures will expire in February of this month. Will she still renew it? Will she accept directors other than Von Sternberg? What is her relationship with Sivil? There are many questions.</p>
<p>She hadn't expressed any opinion for a long time, but recently she cordially received news reporters! Announcing her future whereabouts.</p>
<p>She said that her contract with Von Sternberg expired after the recent completion of a film. She said very firmly that she would no longer stay in Hollywood, but would prepare to sing in Paris, Berlin, and London.</p>
<p>She said that her appearance on the screen was not for money. Money was not a big deal to her. She joined Paramount entirely at the urging of Von Sternberg. So maybe she will still accept his persuasion and stay in Hollywood, but she only wants to be directed by Sternberg alone.</p>
<p>Regarding the various rumors about her and Sivil, she said: "Outsiders may have forgotten that I am a married woman. My husband and I have never considered divorce. He is still having a happy Christmas."</p>
<p>Marlene has been in Hollywood for three and a half years, completing a total of five films. However, with just these five films, she has already occupied an important position in Hollywood.</p>
<p>In short, the mysterious Dietrich is just like Garbo's second!</p>

<p>— Zong Wen</p>
<p>(A) Some actors clearly do not need to be the leading role in a certain play, but they insist on being so, simply because they are ashamed to be inferior to others. By the time the play is filmed and people criticize their shortcomings, it is already too late!</p>
<p>(B) The shortcomings of companies mutually denigrating each other. If a company has a good actor, they are often poached by another company. As a result, the originally good partnership cannot last forever, and the film is greatly diminished!</p>
<p>(C) There are often disagreements in companies, so that if a company has a good director, but the actors have incompatible personalities, the result will certainly not be a good film.</p>
<p>(D) Lack of the spirit of international promotion.</p>

<p>— Shi Chun</p>
<p>Those who have seen "The Gold Diggers" should be familiar with Loretta Young's skills. Although she is a supporting actress, she adds a lot of brilliance to the film. She is only nineteen years old this year, but she has already been married and divorced, and has been a housewife, managing household affairs and property very shrewdly.</p>
<p>Loretta has been sophisticated since she was a child. At the age of sixteen, she already had a lover. When her parents tried to restrain her slightly, she left home and lived with her lover. At the age of eighteen, she had a falling out with her good lover and divorced. After the divorce, because she was lonely, she lived with her mother and sisters.</p>
<p>Loretta entered the film industry at a young age. She knows the situation in the film industry like the back of her hand. She says that the changes in the film industry are unpredictable, so once she finds a suitable partner and marries him, she is determined to leave the film industry.</p>

<p>— Hui Feng</p>
<p>Shao Renmei, the general manager of the Seastar Company in Singapore, is the younger brother of Shao Zuiweng, the general manager of the Tianyi Film Company. He is very straightforward, capable, and full of courageous and enterprising spirit. In 1927, he went to the South Seas Islands to investigate the film business, and then co-founded the Seastar Company in Singapore with local overseas Chinese, managing Chinese and foreign films. He also founded many cinemas in Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, Penang, Seremban, Ipoh, Yangon, and other places. In the South Seas film industry, Mr. Shao is truly a giant. In 1930, he also went to Japan to study sound films. Last year, when Tianyi Company started filming Movietone sound films, Mr. Shao returned to China to assist in the process, and then returned to the South Seas. It is now reported that Mr. Shao arrived in Shanghai on the morning of the 16th, and Shao Zuiweng, Shao Cunren, and others went to the pier to greet him.</p>

<p>— Ye Min</p>
<p>Originally, Ruan Lingyu, Chen Yumei, and Hu Die were known as the representative stars of the three major companies. Since Liming Hui returned to Shanghai from Hong Kong and re-entered the film industry, a new term, "Four Great Diamonds," has been coined. (Referring to Hu, Ruan, Chen, and Li.) However, apart from Chen and Li both belonging to Tianyi, Hu is in Mingxing and Ruan is in Lianhua, so there are very few opportunities for them to gather together. The day before yesterday, Chen Yumei hosted a banquet for the major stars at her home. In addition to Hu, Ruan, and Li all attending, there were also Xu Qinfang, Hu Shan, Tang Xueqing, Fan Xuepeng, Xu Lai, etc. It was truly a gathering of beauties, an unprecedented event. And the "Four Great Diamonds," who rarely gather together, exchanged toasts and drank freely together. The most eloquent person at the table was the little sister Liming Hui. Hu, Ruan, and others were also in particularly good spirits, teasing each other with laughter. The hostess, Chen Yumei, wore light makeup and a dark outfit and did not speak much. Halfway through the banquet, the hostess invited the stars to take a photo together to commemorate the occasion. So they ran to the studio at home and took a group photo. In the front row of the picture (from left to right) are Chen Yumei, Hu Die, Liming Hui, Ruan Lingyu, and Xu Qinfang. In the back row (from left to right) are Hu Shan, Tang Xueqing, Xu Lai, and Fan Xuepeng.</p>
<h3 id="e274">The "Match King" Story (12) <a href="#e274" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c274" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">274</a></h3>
<p>— Translated by Xi Meng</p>
<p>Erick looked at Paul's face with eyes like a child admiring his father. He also knew Paul's thoughts, but the Match King's business had grown so large, and the debt was so alarming, that if Paul didn't use his extraordinary talent, the iceberg would be in danger of collapsing.</p>
<p>But a few weeks later, Paul bought a train ticket again to go to 利佛拉 in France. He wanted to send a telegram to invite 慕爾娜 to go with him. Before he finished sending the telegram, Erick ran in. Paul smiled at him, with an indescribable joy in his heart, "This time I'm really going. I won't even tell you where I'm going, so you don't come to 陸慈堡 to find me and bring me back like last time. I'm going to heaven to rest for three weeks."</p>
<p>"Of course, that's as it should be," Erick said with a smile. "But 尼伯格 is outside, he wants to see you. Won't you see him? He wouldn't tell me why he wanted to see you, he just said the matter was extremely important."</p>
<p>"Okay, tell him to come in," Paul thought that nothing in the world could stop him now. He held the train ticket in his pocket, thinking that nothing in the world was impossible.</p>
<p>"Ask him to come in, maybe he can tell me that Japanese matches were found on a German ship in Liverpool!"</p>
<p>尼伯格 was one of Paul's secret detectives, and now he came in. He had a face full of pockmarks, so he brought amazing news, and his face didn't show it at all.</p>
<p>Paul jumped up.</p>
<p>"Nothing of the sort," Paul's eyes widened. He told Erick to leave.</p>
<p>"It's absolutely true," 尼伯格 stated solemnly. His name is 克禮斯欽霍勃. The self-lighting invention that can be struck, lit, blown out, and then struck and lit again. That is a perpetual match. This is of great importance to our future. But that man trusts me very much, and I can find a way to get his detailed explanation.</p>
<p>"I'll go with you," Paul said suddenly. 慕爾娜 and the train ticket in his pocket were all thrown to Java.</p>
<p>This matter went very smoothly. He got the inventor's instructions without any effort. He knew its content tomorrow, besides the old inventor, there was no third person in the world. The old man also believed that the Match King could definitely help him, so he frankly handed the instructions to Paul 克魯爾.</p>
<p>Paul 克魯爾 returned to the office and made a phone call.</p>
<p>At Paul, the phone call was 保, creating endless future troubles; but for the old inventor, it was a permanent confinement in a lunatic asylum, his mad roar, it was　　's surface　!</p>
