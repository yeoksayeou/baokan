<p>時評</p>
<h3>美國批准白銀恊定與國内恐慌之救濟（英）</h3>
<p>據本月二十一日華盛頓電訊。美國政府已將倫敦經濟會議時各國所締白銀恊定即予批准。並令人民將新採白銀送至造幣廠。半數繳納政府。歸國庫收管。作爲鑄幣費與手續費。半數於鑄成銀幣後。交還原主蓋自倫敦白銀恊定於本年七月二十二日成立而後。四閱月始經印度政府予以批准。五閱月而美國政府繼予批准。按原約規定。該恊定須經各國政府於一九三四年四月一日以前批准。始能生效。但產銀國則不因一國或一國以上未予批准之故。而失去拘束之力。故就白銀恊定而論。美國政府此時批准一舉。僅爲締約手續之履行。且美國旣爲最大產銀國。而印度又爲用銀主要國。前者在恊定上所負義務爲每年收購出鑛生銀二千四百萬盎士。後者在恊定上所負義務爲每年出售存銀不逾三千五百萬盎士。之二國者。今均能先後予以批准。其他各國之批准。自屬無甚障碍。而白銀恊定之前途。大致可期其成立矣。</p>
<p>夫白銀恊定之締結。爲世界經濟會議時。一部分國家企圖以國際行動維持銀價爲解决恐慌之方法尤以美國之野心爲敢顯明。恊定之基本精神。並不在於締約國之能否一致予以批准。而在乎協定之施行以後。銀價能否　到抬高一目的。物價能否有向上之趨勢。此固言時世界經濟會議所欲發揮之使命。亦倡議締此恊定最力之美國所欲獲得之結晶。故此點最爲重要。然吾人苟能於今日世界經濟恐慌之根本懲結。略加考察。則知美國此種救濟之方法。不惟將來必至毫無收獲。且恐適足以增强各國立場之掠奪而有餘。夫今日世界各國經濟之根本困難。實由於生產數量超過有效需求。而有效需求之所以不能向上。則由於一般社會購買能力之薄弱。故貨積如山。不能行銷。此物價之所由跌落。蓋物價之落。果也。非因也。今美國於國内經濟極端恐慌之時。乃欲以遠東各殖民地國家之市塲爲傾銷之尾閭。思以此抬高銀價之結局。增加遠東之購買能力。然其實遑論銀價能否因此抬高。尙屬絶大疑問。即能抬高。而遂謂遠東人民之消費。能因之發達。果有此把握耶。萬一遠東之經濟衰落如故。市場之不能開關如故。則貨物之不行銷。必至物價仍無起色。因果釐然。理所必至也。不觀乎美國自本年十月購金政策發動而後。始而國内收買黃金。繼而國外操縱匯兌。把持金價。然而效力依然未收。恐慌仍舊恐慌。今之購銀政策。其結果能不爲購金之續乎。</p>

<p>（棉花）　自本年九月新棉登市、咸運濟南、上海帮雖有購買、因美棉運到、購買不甚親切、東洋帮抵制印棉後、採購魯棉、而進胃不多、國貨紗廠、青島華新·濟南魯豐·成通等、多因紗銷不暢、購買亦不踴躍、前時售四十四五元者、現售三十八九元、且每日現貨交易及到期期貨運出一二千包、而同時進貨亦每日一二千包、兩數相抵、總計現在全市存棉十二萬五千包、每包平均六十元、價值當有七百五十萬元、</p>
<p>（生米）　花生米銷路、大見窄狹、青島帮東洋帮、均無大量購買、僅有廣帮採購、數亦寥寥、初登市時、五元四五者、現在僅在四元一二角、自福建問題起、廣帮購買亦稀、最近半月以來、當地商人、因生米已跌至最低限度、有購買存儲者、每日略有交易、但非實在售出也、每日交易僅百數十噸、總計現在全市存儲生米十三萬餘包、每包以七元餘計、價值約一百萬元、</p>
<p>（小麥）濟南糧業公會、爲糧米交易總機關、在最盛時、上關交易者百餘家、現僅三十餘家而已、交易以小麥爲大宗、因本年麵粉廠營業不佳、均有虧累、咸縮小範圍、以資支持、生產量減少、購麥亦稀近一星期來、因年關關係、各廠均未購買、界河等處好麥、現僅三元三角餘、總計全市存儲十六萬包、價值約一百三十萬元、</p>

<h3>中華水泥廠聯會呈請免增水泥統稅</h3>
<p>年來國產水泥創痛正深</p>
<p>應請軫念商艱收回成命</p>
<p>本市中華水泥廠商聯合會、以財部於本月五日起、實行增加水泥統稅後、各廠雖已暫時忍痛繳納、但痛苦情形、匪可言宣、昨特具呈財部稅務署、請予轉呈財部收回成命、並發還已繳之所加稅欵、藉拯艱危而維實業、原呈云、呈爲統稅倍徴、暫行</p>
<p>忍痛繳納　仍懇收回成命、以維國產而恤民生事、竊屬會於本年十二月四日、奉鈞署東代電開、增加水泥統稅、經部提出行政院會議議决通過、定於本年十二月五日起、一律實行、查水泥統稅、每桶原徴國幣六角、現改徴匣幣一元二角、其用包袋裝置者、照原稅加倍計算等因、奉命之餘、羣情　駭、祇因限期開徴、急不待緩、屬會會員各公司、迫暫行忍痛照繳、而顧念民生之困敞、實業之艱危、以爲此次修訂稅率、增加一倍之多、將使消費者不勝負荷、生產者難於維持、爲敢不辭瑣凟、爲鈞部縷晰陳之、查國產水泥徴稅、始於前清光緒三十三年、國内海關值百抽五、通行全國、概汪得徴、計每桶實徴關平銀一錢、合國幣一角五分、至民國十六年、始加附稅百分之二·五、仍祇合國幣二角三分之譜、上年統稅實行、每桶驟增至國幣六角、今施行未久、忽又加倍徴收、較之舊額、</p>
<p>增至八倍　卽較十六七年間、亦增六倍、實堪　駭、屬會明知此項稅欵、可以轉嫁買主、預增較數過巨、限期過促、自奉電令、關於民間建築未竟之工程、及各公司未及爲清之定貨、已引起無數糾紛、莫從解决、且水泥馬一切公私建築所必需、非奢侈品與消耗品可比、總理提倡民生、列爲建設之首、國民生主義、並重住行、其所以樂民居而利民行者、胥惟水泥是賴、如果稅率培增、行見一切運設、均將因之阻滯、實與總理建國本旨、適相背馳、若就屬會會員各公司而論、年來國產水泥、因受環境影響、創痛正深、雖蒙政认寺外貨進口稅、以資保護、特因國内多故、民生困窮、謀食不遑、安論建設、故水泥出品、祇有通商巨埠、尙見行銷、内地銷塲、近已日見狹隘、全國產額、素感供過於求、若復</p>
<p>困以重稅　則用户方面、除萬不得已之用途外、必將别謀替代、是不僅水泥銷路之又將縮减、可以斷言、卽在政府稅收方面言之、亦恐稅率雖增、而收入之數、未能盡如預期、推究結果、祇見其徒病商民、無裨國庫已耳、抑有陳者、水泥貨欵、多係放帳、應當統稅辦、均由各廠先行墊支、爲期輒在二三個月左右、稅率旣重、所墊益多、利息損失、已屬不貨、若遇客貨倒閉、則除貨欵以外、尙須賠累稅欵、凡此痛苦、非可言宣、屬會會員各公司集議之下、以爲增改稅率、現旣奉令限期實行、惟有忍痛暫行遵繳、一面仍請鈞都署軫念民艱、賜將增稅原案、</p>
<p>收回成命　並將各公司已繳之所加稅欵、如數發還、藉拯艱危而維實業、迫切上呈、戀祈鈞部署俯賜核示祇進、實深德感、謹呈財政、部稅務署、</p>

<p>交通部國際電訊局籌備之中英能報、向英國馬可尼公司訂購之大號收音機四架、二十啓羅華特發報機二架、及通話機一架、先後由英運滬、當由該局無線電台工程司督飭工匠、將收音機四架、運到瀏河裝設發報機二架、及通話機一架、運至眞茹電台分别配裝以來、各項工程、業已次第完成、該台工程師日來正積極進行校正工作、並檢視所裝各機、有無錯誤、據該台負責人語新新社記者、所裝之發報機及收音機工程、雖已告竣、但其　線校正等手續、頗爲繁冗、日來正由工程師將應用電流、收聚於一處、　步輸送各機之内部使其發動、以試騐有無阻碍、該項工作、爲最繁冗而重要、蓋裝設一新機、於試騐時如稍爲疏路、則將來通報、必蒙絶大影響、故不得不愼得從事也、一俟電流能在各機内部通行無阻、第二步工作、即須從事校正音符是否清晰、至中初正式通報期、須俟以上各項工程完竣後、方克决定、照目下情形觀察、正式通報期、當在明年一月底或二月、英方能實現、至外傳下月十日即可通報說、事實上似難辦到云、</p>
<h3>電報局報差昨一度罷工</h3>
<p>要求加薪當局立予答允</p>
<p>僅半小時卽行恢復原狀</p>
<p>中央社云、交通部上海電報局報差、忽於昨日下午二時、因要求加薪事、發生罷工、自該局業務長華士鑑對於報差要求、即表示接受、故風潮於半小時後即銷滅於無形、中央社記者探得其經過情形如次、</p>
<p>推派代表　該局報差計有六十三人、每日輪班工作、往年本有年功加俸之例、去年七月間全體報差、曾得普加月俸兩元、本年七月本有再加之望、但電報局因某種關係、未予照加、雖經報差三次要求、未午要領、故於昨晨各報差到局時、舉行一臨時會議、决定推派代表、向華業務長作最後之要求、當時推出代表爲經大發·夏順堂·楊志成·丁文和等四人、</p>
<p>一度罷工　昨日午後二時、全體報差於局内庭院中齊集、由代表經大發等四人、要求華業務長、對於加薪問題、加以答復、華業務長對於報差要求、未予切實答覆、四代表不得要領、將此情轉達全體報差全體報差、以要求不遂、宣告罷工、</p>
<p>准予加薪　但邇日來以時局緊張、各方往返電報日以千計、報差罷工、影響實大、華業務長爲顧全大局計、卽下諭謂「本局報差、按照無綫電總台例加薪、不日呈請交部核示、准自本年七月份起照加、」報差以華業務長旣已表示接受、卽行宣告復工、此時已在下午二時半、故罷工時間、實際不過半小時、於三時後、各報差已照常送報矣、</p>
<p>告一段落　據報差方面、對於此次風潮之申述、謂交邇部曾於本年三月間、頒發報差管理規則、内有考績加薪之規定、每年考績兩次、以考績結果、於年度終了時、實行加薪、本應於本年七月間開始加薪、但雖經報差迭次要求、均未得要領、交通部所頒之管理規則、原無有綫電無綫電之分、今無綫電台報差、已於本年七月間實行加薪、則該局亦應有同等之享受、故該局報差認爲當局不允加薪爲不當、但華業務長現旣有接受之表示、是可告一段落云、</p>

<p>（甲）完成全國鐵路貨物負責運輸　世界各國鐵路、靡有不負責運輸者、事屬當然、無足無異、乃吾國鐵路運輸竟由貨商自負責任、以致商賈痛苦、流弊百出、影響所居、幾無底止、竊嘗自念、居今日而言改善鐵路業務、除舉辦負責運輸外、實無其他更較急切之要圖、故於抵任之初、卽以籌辦負責運輸爲惟一之急務、二十一年五月、呈准組織貨物負責運輸委員會、擬定各種章則、同年九月一日、首由津浦京滬滬杭甬三路實行、嗣后隴海膠濟北寗闰漢平綏湘鄂正太道清南潯諸路、亦陸續舉辦、商賈稱便、貨運以振、惟各路負責運輸雖已實行、然以吾國民智之閉、各路積習之深、欲求推行盡善、澈底革新、勢非咄嗟可期、故擬亟謀第二步之改進、以冀抵於最善之域、而收完成負責運輸之功、其改計畫、約有下列諸端、（一）指導運貨商人、鐵路爲供給運輸機關、其對方卽爲需要運輸之貨商、欲謀鐵路運輸之改善、實有待於雙方之努力與合作、吾國貨主因歷來鐵路運輸不負責任之故、鮮有與鐵路直接交易者、所有貨物概託由轉運商人負責辦理、因之對於運輸知識異常缺乏、而一部份之不肖轉運商人則從中取巧、於正當費用之外、多方勒索以致貨主隱受種種痛苦、而莫可如何、夫貨主應視其託運貨物數量之多寡、次數之繁簡、有以直接向鐵路託運較爲經濟者、有以間接向鐵路託運較爲合算者、而轉運商人應儘量爲貨主圖謀便利、爲鐵路招攬營業、並處處以於貨主與鐵路均爲經濟爲前提、然後始能自存發展、而於整個國家經濟之中、盡一份之責任、擬卽本此原則、由各路選派幹練人員、分赴有關各市集場埠及農村、以文字或口頭的方法、盡力宣傳負責運輸之利益、託運收貨種種之手續、及貨主運商與鐵路各方面應有之責任、使一般貨主與運商明瞭如何可以力求運輸之便利與費用之經濟、而在整個經濟潮流趨勢之中、以謀營業之發展、（二）訓練鐵路員工、負責運輸之完成、固有賴於貨商及運商之合作、然苟鐵路員工仍以政府機關自視、氣勢凌人、或對於負責運輸各項規則不甚了解、或對於貨物之收受保管、疏忽遲誤、均足以阻滯負責運輸之發展、故鐵路各站員工必須加以訓練、使之辦事科學化、對人營業化、擬卽由各路挑選員工中之幹練者、先加訓練、再由此等員工轉訓其他員工、或由對於負責運輸已具有相當了解與經騐者、分赴各站訓練、除加以知識上之訓練外、并加以精神上道德上之訓練、使各忠其職且盡其職、（三）實行稽查辦法、以上二種辦法、均屬積極的完成負責運輸之謀、而對於消極的剔除積習、杜防新弊、亦不能不擬具方法、以便稽查、此項稽查方法、批秎三種、一爲會計上之稽核、一爲車務上之查騐、一爲本部之明密隨時派員稽查、其詳細辦法當卽訂定實行之、（未完）</p>

<h3>敎部督學周邦道談陜西敎育現狀</h3>
<p>敎部督學周邦道、視察陜豫敎育回京後、關於視察兩省敎育之詳細報告、正在編製中、茲就私人談話、將周督學所談陜西敎育情形、先行記述於下、</p>
<p>（一）一般狀况　陜西省因連年災荒匪亂、農村破產、社會俶擾、過去數年敎育事業、屢屢停頓、受過莫大損失、學生思想偏激、學風異常囂張、驅逐敎員毆殺校長、諸種怪劇、時有所聞、近年農田收成稍佳、社會比前安定、敎廳又切實徒事整頓、故各種敎育、頗有後興與維新的氣象、學生亦漸趨入正軌、</p>
<p>（二）敎育經費　該省敎育經費、數量甚少、本年度省敎育經费、共計九十二萬一千三百七十八元、其支配於敎育行政者、十萬二千餘元、中學三十四萬八千餘元、師範十九萬二千餘元、職業敎育八萬四千餘元、初等敎育十一萬九千餘元、社會敎育七萬三千餘元、概以八成發放、各縣敎育經費、除南鄭十萬餘元、長安八萬餘元外、其餘各縣、以四五千元至七八千元者爲最多</p>
<p>（三）敎育機關　全省各級學校及社敎機關、（一）「中學」省立者有西安高中、一中、中山中學、鳳翔二中、三原三中、一女中南鄭五中、榆林六中、安康七中共九校、（四中已停辦、）又縣立者有六校、聯立者有二校、私立者有六校、（二）師範」省立者有西安一師、一女師、大荔二師、南鄭五師、二女師、安康七師、榆林三女師、共七校、（三）師四師六師已停辦、）又省立小學敎師訓練所一處縣立師範講習所十二處、（三）「職業」省立者有西安一職、及三原三職兩校、（二職已停辦）、又縣立者有二校、聯立者有一校、私立者有一校、（四）「小學」有省立完全小學六校、縣立初級小學五千四百五十八校、高級小學一百一十七校、完全小學一百二十五校、私立初級小學三千五百四十五校、高級小學十二校、完全小學四十四校、附設幼稚園者、公私立共計四十七處、（五）社敎」公立社敎機關、計有民衆敎育館八處、圖書館六十處、（又私立一處）、民衆學校七百五十四處、閱報處七十二處、體育塲四十一處、講演所七十五處、</p>
<p>（四）人員待遇　敎育人員之待遇甚薄、省立學校薪金、旣發八成、又打九扣（陜省銀行票）、且不能按月領到、縣立學校薪額甚小、亦多折扣積欠的事實、私立學校量入爲出、計時授薪、每月所得、多不能維持個人生活、敎育廳長月薪一百二十元、秘書科長督學、月支八十元至一百元、益以紙鈔折扣、所得無幾、但服務精神、未曾因是而减損、殊堪欽偑、</p>
<p>（五）縣敎行政　該省縣敎育局只保留十縣、其已裁撤者、分兩種辦理、一在縣府設敎育助理員、一着由縣府某一科兼辦、因無專人負責、敎育行政效率、極其低微、如部中最近頒行各種學校法及規程、多未轉令至各校、欲謀振興並普及敎育、非先將敎育局恢復不可、</p>
<p>（六）小學敎育　小學尙有單獨設立高級者、殊爲不合、其沿用模範舊名稱或採用實騐新名稱者、實際與普通小學無何差異第一期義務小學及短期小學舉辦者、不過一二縣份、長安城内、省縣立小學、辦理均尙不錯、惟省立小學、因受政治影響較多、各項設施、間有視縣立小學較遜之處、</p>
<p>（七）中學敎育　省立中學現已整理就緒、敎職員服務精神、及學生求學精神、均多可取、惟敎育設備、異常簡單、除高級中學外、理化儀器藥品、多係十年前所購置、因軍事匪亂種種影響、殘餘無幾、高級中學承西北大學中山大學之後、校舍寛敞、設備充足、師資亦比較優良、不媿爲該省一領袖學校、一中、二中、三中、中中等校、辦理頗有精神、學生紀律亦佳、私立玫瑰女中、學生圖畫剌繡、成績優異、惟敎職員過於守舊、對於新敎育的設施、比較落後、私立咸林中學、歷史悠長、環境幽靜、生產敎育、成績斐然、爲一般中學所不及、惟學生風潮、最近似不甚整飭、</p>
<p>（八）師範敎育　省立師範學校、據所見一師一女師兩校、辦理均尙認眞、惟初中班均多過師範班、名實不相符契、殊非設立師範學校之本旨、小學敎師訓練所、由各縣咨送現任小學校敎員二名至三名、入所訓練一學期、然後回縣服務、第一期以關中各縣爲限、第二期陜南、第三期陜北、計畫頗好、辦理亦頗有精神、各縣師範講習所、年限一年或二年、均嫌太短、設備課程師資等項、亦欠完善、</p>
<p>（九）職業敎育　省立第一職校、辦農林墾牧三科、第三職校辦染織科、校舍寛宏、農塲工廠、面積亦大、但學生畢業后、多數係充當小學敎員、或軍隊司書、對於所學職業、毫無出路、西安私立平民女子職校、織染縫紉出品、成績頗佳、學生每月可得酬金數元、該校規模較小、但實事求是、逐漸擴充、對於婦女職業、頗多貢獻、華陰縣立織染工廠、現改辦職業、補習學校、基礎甚好、先辦工廠、后辦學校、程序亦合、主持人李仲規、發明紡織機多件、價廉物美、大有助於職敎之推廣、榆林共立陜北職校、素負盛譽、在西安民敎館所陳列各種出品、亦尙精緻、聞周督學在西安時、曾得該校電請前往、嗣因交通與時間關係、未及視察、</p>
<p>（七）社會敎育　西安省立民敎館、地點適中、館舍整雅、布置設備、均頗完善、各種工作、亦尙緊張、省立圖書館、館舍寛綽、載籍豐富、所藏圖書集成藏經、及秦中先哲著作、頗多希世之珍、敎廳在西安設立民衆學校數十處、分區配置、每區設一實騐民校、領導恊動、統由民衆學校管理處主持進行、頗有成績、各縣社敎、因辦理人學識能力、及責任心關係、多屬有名無實、</p>
<p>（十一）地方敎育　周督學談、就所到縣份比較、以長安爲最優、次爲三原、次爲華縣、次爲渭南、三原縣欵支絀、而辦學人員、刻苦犠牲、努力從公、其熱忱毅力、有足多者、武功城内、只有一完全小學、一初級小學、前者校舍設備、尙有可觀、后者與尋常私塾、無甚差異、鳳翔因師範人才太少、雖有小學數處成績均欠優良、華陰正舉行全部小學各科競賽試騐、辦法與學期會考相髴髣、敎育助理員主持進行頗爲熱心云、</p>

<h3>繁榮市面</h3>
<p>— 徐小庭</p>
<p>水災，旱災，　踐傷農，我國自從農村經濟破產以來，内地各省縣，因商業之不振，營業清淡，市面清貧冷落，雖昔日極繁華極興盛之道衢要道，不轉瞬間，現在人跡寥寥，死氣充塞，在這國内大都市日趨發達，内地小城市日形緊縮的畸形發展之下，内地的社會，已如失了靈魂的人身一樣，僵硬的局面，　單在大地，社會的死氣，已充滿在市街的上層。</p>
<p>大都市的繁榮，有電影院，跳舞塲，公娼，私娼，以及其他内的待合所，尋求娛樂的魔窟，官僚，政客，資本家，吸引着一切的人類，内地的城市，根本上旣没有這樣　美的建設，一旦冷落下來，眞如待死的患肺病者，雖要設法治療，挽救，却没有相當的辦法。</p>
<p>一般富有紳士化的先覺者，以及憂心商業不振的商界巨子，因爲要挽救這種頑勢，他們對於繁榮市面的計劃，很能迫切誠懇的探討着，研究着，然而探討僅可探討，市面的冷寂，一切人羣，仍是墮在没落的深淵襄，掙扎，感喟，尋不着一線的生路！</p>
<p>提倡迷信的人們，在這種狀况下，就來發起迎神賽會，演劇酬神，以便引起民衆的視線，替社會打一針强心劑，希望商業發達的朋友，就舉行大减價，創立購物贈奬的辦法，以便引起人民的購買力，彌補自己的營業失敗，結果，小孩子玩的肥皂泡，只可供一時的玩賞，過了這個時期，仍然走上冷寂，没落，失敗的慘途！</p>
<p>内地社會，旣以商業發達與否，爲繁榮市面之中心，現在各縣商業均普徧現着不景氣，吾人今日要求已死的社會，跑上繁榮的途徑，眞不是一件容易的事，一般憂時的先覺者，雖抱着十二分熱忱，設法改造補救，硬欲在浮表的土層上挖出燦爛的金礦，但是此事猶之一個天暗雲塞的晦暗的早晨，硬要望着日光之奔臨，是絶對做不到的。</p>

<p>這個金科玉律的學問，比任何學問來寳貴，不容易畢業。得意發財的朋友，便是對於這個學問，有充分的功夫，已經得着畢業文憑。侘傺落拓的朋友，便是對於這個學問，一些兒没有了解。因爲有功夫的少，没了解的多；所以世上得意發財的少，而侘傺落拓的多。</p>
<p>海洋裏大魚，一開口不曉得可呑了幾百頭小魚。大家都是魚，一律平等，爲甚麽大魚可吃小魚？大魚小魚，在海裏大家都可以呼吸自由空氣，自由自在的游來游去；爲甚麽小魚被大魚吃了，從不聞喊一聲「寃枉」？大魚何幸，小魚何罪，我們處世，有了這個「認識」，便不必發「牢騷」了。</p>
<p>傲骨嶙峋的朋友，不願意搖尾乞憐，脅肩謟笑；瞧了闊老偉人們的睥睨一世，頣指氣使，往往一肚皮是氣，鬰鬰不樂。其實，差了！闊老偉人們的視我們，不是像我們的視乞匄，癟三嗎？我們誰肯優待乞匄，恭敬癟三。當然囉，闊老偉人，誰來優待恭敬我們呢。目下時代，恐怕雖然孔明再生，一定也没有三顧章廬的劉備；何况我們！對於現代社會，有了這個「認識」，自然「心平」「氣和」了。</p>

<p>上海之所謂壽頭</p>
<p>壽頭本是可賀；但在上海却以此駡人！</p>
<p>例如到京戲館影戲院等，取一塊錢去買票，狠心的他就銅元角子角鈔的搭花找出，纒得你七葷八素，即如等到你算出交涉，他補給了你時；不讚你的乖，却駡你「壽頭」。</p>
<p>依此類推，能擺闊才識相，（乖也）而勒煞弔死「經濟也」者，壽頭無疑矣！</p>
<h3>東北四連長</h3>
<p>— 張恨水</p>
<p>第二十一回　絮語燈前苦心訓弱息　杖游山下冷眼看英雄</p>
<p>甘積之一路行來，他都是低了頭在那裏想心事，心意中實在不曾想到對面就有所想的人走了來。這時他聽到有人咦了一聲，猛然一抬頭，才看到是桂枝。雖然自己不免吃了一驚，但是自己究竟是在外面常有交際的人，立刻鎭定住了，伸手取下了帽子，向他笑着一鞠躬道：很久不見了。桂枝向後退了兩步，用牙咬着嘴唇，眼皮一撩，向他笑道：甘爺對我可以說這句話，我對甘二爺，可就不能這樣說了。積之道：這話怎麽講，我倒有些不懂。桂枝笑道：前兩天，我由府上門口經過，看見二爺在院子來回的走。二爺忙着呢，可没有看到我。積之兩隻手抱了呢帽子，向他連拱了兩下手道：這倒有些對不住！桂枝在退後兩步的所在，依然呆呆的站住，只把笑臉來看着積之，並無什麽話說。積之因他没有什麽話說，一時也想不到把什麽話來對答，在這西風曠野裏兩個人對立着，彷彿一對石製翁仲一樣。積之立刻感到這不是辦法，就向桂枝微笑道：大姑娘，幾時給我們喜酒喝呢？我這次回海甸來，總算趕上這個機會了。他本來因爲彼此對立着無聊，搭訕着，借了這句話來解嘲的。不想他不說這話，還自罷了。一說這話之後，桂枝更加覺得不好意思；兩腮猶如在火爐子邊烤了一般，一直紅到耳朶根下來。兩隻眼睛的上眼皮，同時向下埀着，簇擁出兩線睫毛來。他耳上埀着兩片小小的假翠葉環子，這個時候，忽然飄飄蕩蕩，在頸𩓐子旁邊，顚倒起來，這可以看出他的肌肉是怎樣的顫動着了。（二七八）</p>
<h3>北國的冬</h3>
<p>— 黃克威</p>
<p>北國，没有醉人的春，也没有酷熱的夏，四季是黃沙飛舞，日光陰暗，顯示着荒漠，寒冷的氣象。</p>
<p>當温柔綺麗的江南，正是北風怒吼，濃霜蓋瓦的時節，在北國，已變成冰天雪地了。</p>
<p>原野上，山谷間，溶成了一片晶螢的雪光；戴重的駱駝，驢馬，踏出吃吃喳喳的聲浪，印着深深的脚跡；騎在高背上的皮貨高，穿着皮大襖，耳朶上，腦袋上，都套着毛茸茸的皮套，但呵出來的熱氣，已很快地凝結在硬鬍髭上啦。</p>
<p>河流連底凍住了，就是用鐵鎚猛力敲一下，也不過顯出一綫白痕，於是享樂的人們做着滑冰的玩意兒，或是挾着伴侶，乘着雪車，順斜坡滑下，到處賞玩雪景。他們是多麽愉快，安樂呵！</p>
<p>可是！在冰天雪地裏，吾們已不能見到雄赳赳的抗日健兒，只見到長城上血紅的太陽旗，迎着北風耀武揚威地飄蕩着！</p>
<p>破碎的河山，殘缺的戰壕，健兒的熱血。都給白雪掩蓋了—那爲寒氣侵冷了血的人們，當然已遺忘了一切的恥辱悲壯的故事，迷戀在美麗的雪景裏，沉醉在化裝滑冰大會裏了！</p>
<h3>經騐談</h3>
<p>— 子康</p>
<p>一個女子給我們覺得最可愛的時候，就是伊已經說不愛我們了的那時候。</p>
<p>窮到連飯都没得吃的當兒，肚子是特别的容易餓，就是每天吃了四五頓也都可以的樣子，但是有飯吃了的時候，却常常見到飯就討厭了。</p>
<p>回家鄉去，住不上二天，便覺得家鄉的生活很乏味，離開了家鄉，却會想到家鄉的可愛。</p>
<p>自己親手煮的飯，雖則煮焦爛了，但是吃起來，總還是覺得比外邊館子裏的飯要有味兒。</p>
<p>短篇小說</p>
<h3>消長</h3>
<p>— 天恨生</p>
<p>以後回來的時日上詎離就更遠，三年，三年半，六年半中回來了兩次。以後，以後更杳無消息，不知在那裡飄泊，只彷彿聽人說阿泉的妻已經死了，並且已經續了弦，是個年紀很輕的女人。但是他的詳細狀况誰不能知道，他現在已經多了幾個錢，却可以無　的肯定，這在他過去三次回鄉的衣履和舉止上，就可以測知的，斷然不是十五年前那麽窮的了。這樣，凡是任識阿泉的人連他的親戚在内，都突然像死灰復燃似的憧念起阿泉來，大家談到阿泉，都有點渴欲一見的意味；同時又都本能地以爲阿泉必已有了新的故事，這個故鄉他是不要了；由此推想，又可知阿泉永永不會回來；這理由就在於俞家已發生重大變化，大家料定，必已爲阿泉所知，不願把女兒送進窮坑，所以纔五六年杳無消息，除了悔婚，不會有别的原因。</p>
<p>這一消息也確是敎人驚異，十五年前，阿泉窮得只䞉了一條舊船；現在，俞家竟窮得只䞉三間舊屋子，别無長物了。明發已在三年前患病逝世，現在就是明發的妻和兒子龍生。雖然龍生已二十二歲，但因天資笨拙，小時候不肯讀書，後來又因爲窮的緣故，只得學木匠，掙不到多少錢。</p>
<p>然而，娶室的需要龍生倒感覺着非常迫切了，青春之火燃燒了他整個的心靈，渴求異性的情緒充滿了他的全意識；在别人憶念阿泉，談起阿泉的時候，他在旁聽了，總是默默地懸想他的未婚妻小玲。在他的擬想中，小玲是個極美麗的女孩兒；雖然他等於不曾見過面，可是在夢境裡，他和伊已會過好多次，只不過很模糊地記不清伊在夢中來會的面貌罷了。</p>
<p>龍生急於要娶妻，自然向母親要求。母親回憶起十五年前阿泉要把女兒過門童養的舊事來，很懊悔當時没有同意，如果童養，現在就不至於杳無消息了，也許還可以靠着阿泉發了財，得到一點沾潤。但懊悔無益，伊爲了兒子要求，只得去找媒人。可是這時候，姜四爺也死了。朱長春，那原是明發請出來做帮媒的，他不負這個責任，並且他也埋怨伊家當初不同意童養，伊每次去見長春，都是惘然而無力地走回家來。</p>
<p>青春之火極度的燃燒，使龍生失去了理智，竟以爲是母親不肯給他娶，常常籍端大鬧。越鬧，母親越是對過去不同意童養懊悔，對現在的窮困傷感，對未來的生活恐怖，這樣過下去，要不成一份人家的！偏是對阿泉發財的測度，倒漸漸地證實了，有人在千里以外的一個大城市中遇見阿泉，說是比從前格外發胖，臉上氣色好，一定已發了財；母親更是有一種說不出的難過，龍生却急忙向那人追問在什麽地方遇着阿泉。</p>
<p>幾天後，龍生忽然失蹤，不知去向。</p>

<p>兩日、客帮方面、安胃甚寂、意外多　、又少活動、廠方則略有出檔、故市氣平靜之中、已　軟弱不前之態、迨至下午開盤、初尙平定、美國廠家仍見續出、又以結束在週、多頭紛紛脫手、市氣步隐下屬、三鐘後又傳日商在大連洋　、價見續跌、聞祇二元零五分、一說謠傳祇一元九角八分、　此情形、人心自益難振、且三埠粉之前途、恐愈不堪設想矣、結果本月份較前日又跌二分七厘半、一月份跌三分半、二月份跌三分、三月份跌二分七厘半、四月份跌二分厘半、五月份跌三分、</p>
<h3>本月麥交割八十三車</h3>
<p>—標麥市狀冷寂之至—</p>
<p>麥市上下午開盤後、各月份市面、均量清淡沉寂之態、以洋麥旣停市無報價、各月份之賣買、均少洋意、且本月份已經過去、籌碼愈少、遠期雙方均事觀望、故出入又寂、結果祇三月份好一分、四月份小一分、至本月份之標準交割、昨已全數履行、總數共八十三車、由六號十九號二十四號二十七號三十五號等交出、由二十三號三十六號等收進、</p>
<h3>糖市首批國產新棉赤登塲</h3>
<p>—開十七元—</p>
<p>昨日糖市趨勢平疲、公會劃盤二四粗砂白普通劃十九元六角無上落、轉口貨小五分、爲六元七角半、二十號中砂白高貨轉口六元七角半、八九號荷赤轉口貨七元、太古糖平定、仍二十元六角、振記本廠綿白一號小一角、爲十八元五角半、潮帮號家開新提青十三元七角、又小一角、普通十二元八角又開首批新棉赤百餘包、價爲十七元、</p>
<h3>疋頭元色子貢走銷大活</h3>
<p>昨呢羢交易、零碎爲多、元青色子貢呢、走銷頗活踴、西服帮及時裝女色店等績有購辦蓋男女皮大衣多取元色子貢、故中西日各貨現多在旺銷中、七元左右之貨、走銷更爲暢達、本街及首都咸有大宗進胃、去路之迅速爲目前毛織品中首屈一指、國產章華元色貢呢、售開七元半、日貨色子貢爲七元、愼傳侂元七角半、禮和十三元四角、</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<h3>從變換到加深</h3>
<p>— 若耶</p>
<p>許多論作家修養的書裏，常常的提到「變換環境」的問題。</p>
<p>「變換環境」的意思，是如廚川白村所說，爲的是發見「新的自我。」說得明白一點，就是作家要不時的改換自己的生活環境，用不斷的新生活經騐，來充實自己，來充實作品的内容，這纔能使創作的源泉不涸竭，創作的生命永久常新。</p>
<p>最近，看到好萊塢的Ｓtar，作家的伊麗莎蘭第的一篇談話。她的主要的意思是，「你就是住在美容院裏，也不能保持你的青春。你的精神，你的思想，你的全部生活計劃，必須有勃勃的春氣，然後你的面部才可以將你的青春輝映出來。」這當然是說女子應如何保持青春。在裏面，她又解釋着說，「人類年齡最大的仇敵，是生活上的沉悶」，她主張生活須常常「變換」，從室内傢俱的佈置起。意思也就是勸人「變換環境」，來增加生活的興味，來保持精神上的永永常新。這是把「變換環境」的問題，不限於作家，推張到一切方面說。</p>
<p>果眞祇要能常常的「變換環境」，就可以使自己的生活豐富，使自己的生命常新嗎？我想這是不完全可靠的。自然，「變換生活」可以帮助作家作品内容的充實新鮮，一般人增加生活的興趣；可是這樣，並不能證明他們對於生活的了解加深，而在生活的加深了解中，去發展他們自己。我認爲更主要的，不是「變換環境」，來獲得生活上的不斷的Surprise，而是能夠很深刻的「認識生活。」連繫起來講，就是加深對於生活的了解是第一義，「變換生活」是比較次要的。若不了解生活，就是每天「變換環境」一次，究竟有什麽意思呢？</p>
<p>要充實你的生活，你的作品嗎？有可能時，你可以常常「變換環境」，但是，你必須首先加深自己對於生活的了解，我如此的補充說。</p>
<h3>舊事新感</h3>
<p>— 徐懋庸</p>
<p>世界最大的聖經，而且是第四世紀西奈山手卷，這誠然是一件名貴的古物。但有着這樣的古物的俄國，却並不知道珍藏，反而將這讓給英國博物院了，并將代價十萬鎊向英轉購機器。</p>
<p>這會使人又想起我國的ＸＸＸＸ以及Ｘ先生的舞弊案，而使我想起的却是也與Ｘ先生有點關係的另一件事。</p>
<p>前幾年，中國曾有一個要學生一面讀書一面做工的學校。我曾是那裏面的一個學生。有一年，我們的一級被派在鐵工塲實習。但是有很久的時候，我們得不到工作。那時世界經濟恐慌還不曾發生，而且我們的工廠，根本和市塲不生關係，不會受外來的影響的，我們之所以没有工作，只是因爲學校領不到經費，買不起原料。然而，說起來實很可笑，譬如我們在鐵工塲，並不眞像做工，只是玩玩而已的，因此，並不需要很多的鐵做原料。據估計起來，學校當局只要每月化五十塊錢，就夠我們的消費了。然而據說，那是實在連五十塊錢也拿不出。</p>
<p>但是有一回，我們發現了一椿怪事。在工塲裏，居然有許多小工，把很大的機器一架架地打碎。工塲外面還等着一輛運貨汽車。我們問小工，知道是工塲主任的主意，把這些機器當作廢鐵，買給另一工廠了。這很使我們憤怒。把好好的機器當廢鐵出賣，有這麽多的廢鐵出賣而不分一點給我們做原料，而且我們還知道這是主任個人的主意，未經校務會議通過。根據這三點，我們認定主任犯了大罪，於是發宣言，打電報，向全校敎職員學生及在南京的校長控訴。</p>
<p>校長先生聞訊之下，也震怒了，於是特地派了委員到校查審。查審會是在校長辦公室開的，出席的除委員外，還有秘書長，敎職員代表，學生會代表，以及作原告的我們的代表，和被告的主任，而且還有一個工業專家列席。在兩小時的辯論中，被告終於理屈辭窮了，預設的種種掩飾手段，也被原告一一擊破了。眞相已至大白之際，最後，那個工業專家忽然起來說話了，他說工場主任在手續上確欠完備，但毁壞機器之罪是没有的，他以專家的資格，敢於斷定，那些機器實已無用，等於廢鐵。</p>
<p>這塲案件，就如此結束。原告和被告，兩造都無罪。因爲自委員以至我們都不是工業專家，對於那個專家的話無從反駁。雖然在兩個月以前我們明明看見這些機器都還是能夠生產的。</p>
<p>從此以後，我方纔明白了黑幕的機構和專家的妙用，并且觸類旁通，懂得了一種很大的世故。</p>
<p>把好的機器打碎了作廢鐵出賣和把無用的Ｘ物去交換高價的機器，這是破落的舊家和新發户之不同，也就是今日的中國和俄國之不同。</p>
<h3>地理課</h3>
<p>— 李輝英</p>
<p>先生站在講台上，打開一幅民國二十一年製成的中華民國大地圖，掛在黑板旁邊，給學生門指示着「滿洲國」的國境；隨着敎鞭在圖上的轉動，他口裏解說着：</p>
<p>『看，從這兒起，到這兒，又拐個彎，到這兒，到這兒，又回到這兒，這就是「滿洲國」的國境』。</p>
<p>他是從，山海關指起的。沿着海岸指着，然後到鴨綠江，圖們江，再往上到烏蘇里江，黑龍江，往下指到額爾古納河，蒙古，察哈爾的邊境一直到長城，又歸到山海關原位上。</p>
<p>『看好没有？明白没有？這就是「滿洲國」的國境。』</p>
<p>他向台下的三十幾個小學生問詢着，想不到座位上倒有一多半的小手兒舉起來。按照座次，他是要向學生們問明疑難的地方的。</p>
<p>「胡南山，你那兒不明白？」</p>
<p>胡南山坐在頭一排，站起來大模大樣地說着：</p>
<p>『先生，這是中華民國大地圖，怎麽會出來個「滿洲國」呢？』</p>
<p>他没有即刻回答，打算問完了所有舉手的學生，一起來答覆，讓胡南山坐下去，他再問着别的學生。</p>
<p>「去年，先生不是說東三省是中國的土地麽？」</p>
<p>『先生，執河也歸了「滿洲國」？以前不也是中國地方嗎？』</p>
<p>『如果「滿洲國」不是中國了那我們也不是中國人了！』</p>
<p>問完了舉手的學生，都不出這一類相同的話。</p>
<p>他可是難住了。</p>
<p>論理，也是知道這回事情的；怎樣成立了「滿洲國」，「滿洲國」怎樣就分有了中國的土地，是誰把「滿洲國」創造出來的。可是，他不能照直地說出來呀，想那麽辦，除非自己不想要自己的性命了，——日本人一定會抓去砍頭。</p>
<p>但因此却引起他無限的悲哀，爲他自己，爲這些小學生們，他覺得還有更多的人，在這「滿洲國」的名份下全爲日本帝國作了死也不容翻身的奴隸。</p>
<p>他呆站在講台上，眼眶中不期然地冒出了兩滴巨大的熱淚。</p>
<p>『「滿洲國」—是—新近成立的，—是跟—中國分了家的。』</p>
<p>呆了一會，就只能吃吃地這麽說着，敷衍着學生們的疑問。他想這樣的說完，就忍心地把功課趕過去了，但是，這究竟還没有滿足學生們疑難的欲望。在他們小小的心靈中，立時追憶到九一八以後城市與鄉村騷亂的陳跡。他們還多少知道一些，是日本人把「滿洲國」造出來的，從中國版圖上分去了一大片土地，所以他們變換了話頭又問起來：</p>
<p>『先生，那麽「滿洲國」是怎麽成立的呢？』</p>
<p>『先生，先生誰把「滿洲國」從中國身上分下來的』</p>
<p>他想擺脫學生們的包圍，不但不可能，倒還讓學生們更急切地纒住了，現在學生們所問到的問題，更覺嚴重了，切實了。他由於自身處境的困難，一下子就想起都德筆下的「最後一課」，比一比，他自己連同台下的學生，都比那小說中的人物更不幸些。那個老先生，他還能夠替學生注入一劑最後的興奮劑，而他是連半個關於日本人的壞處的字眼都不敢說出口的。</p>
<p>怎麽辦呢，一個作先生的如果不能滿足學生們的欲望，那學生們會要輕視他的，尤其是一些小學生們，更以敎師的能否答覆問題，據爲評定先生好壞的條件。</p>
<p>『「滿洲國」，是日本帝國主義造成的——』他剛想不顧一切地照實　地答覆着學生們，偏巧在這時響起下課鈴，這無異是解救他的困境的恩人。他趕忙收拾好地圖，連向着台下的學生們瞥一眼的勇氣都没有了，順便地說一句，「下堂了，等下一次再說罷，」就匆匆地走出課堂去了。</p>
<h3>兩兄弟（七一）</h3>
<p>— 莫泊桑著　李維克譯</p>
<p>「讓我說……聽啦……我還有許多話要和你說，好使你懂得……可是你不會懂得的……因爲……假使你要我留着的話……那非……不，我不能夠……」</p>
<p>「說呀，媽媽，說呀。」</p>
<p>「好罷！我說。至少我没有騙你……你要我留着和你在一塊，不是嗎？爲着這個緣故，爲着使我們還能夠看見，還能夠說話，還能夠整天在一個屋子裏碰到——因爲我現在簡直再不敢開門了，恐怕在那門後見到你的哥哥，——爲着這個緣故，你不要原諒我，——再没有什麽比原諒還使人難堪的，——却要對於我以前所作的事根本不感着惱怒……你要覺得自己狠强，覺得自己與衆不同，你才能想到你不是羅蘭的兒子而不會紅臉，而不會輕蔑我……，我已痛苦夠了……我太痛苦了，我再不能痛苦了，不，我再不能痛苦了！並且我的痛苦不是從昨天開始的，這是由來已久的……可是你不會懂得這事，你！爲着使我們還能一塊生活，還能互相擁抱，我的小哲安，你狠可設想我雖是你父親的情婦，可是其實更是他的妻子，他的眞正的妻子，我對於這事心裡是毫没有什麽慚愧的，我什麽都不後悔，他現在死了我還是愛他，我將永遠愛他，我衹愛過他一人，他是我的整個生命，我所有的快樂，我所有的希望，我所有的安慰，我的一切，在那樣長久的時間裏，他是我的一切！聽我說啦，我的小寳寳，我可以當着上帝面前說，假使我不曾遇着他，那我的生涯中便没有一點趣味，什麽都没有，没有一點愛憐，没有一點温柔，没有一點那種可使我們非常悵憾着自己衰老的時份，什麽都没有！我的一切都是他給我的！在這世界上我衹有他一人，隨後有着你們兩個，你哥哥和你。没有你們，我的生活便是空虚的，像夜晚一樣黑暗和空虚。假使我不曾遇着他，那我便什麽都不會愛，什麽都不會認識，什麽都不會希望，甚至連哭都不會有了。——因爲我曾哭過，我的小哲安。啊！是啦，我曾哭過，自從我們來到這裏起。我曾把整個自己給了他，身體和靈魂，永久地，幸福地給了他，並且我可以在那把我們配成一對的上帝面前宣說，在十多年間，我是他的妻子正和他是我的丈夫一樣。隨後，我知道他愛我没有以前那樣熱烈了。他是始終和善而又慇懃的，可是我在他的心目中已不和以前一樣了。這便完全了！啊！我曾怎樣哭過來啊！……生活是怎樣卑劣而又狡詐啊！……什麽都不會持久的……於是我們便搬來了這裏；而我便永没有再見着他，他永没有來過……他每次來信總說要來……我一直等着他！……而我不曾再見着他……而現在他却死了……可是他旣然想到你，那他一定還愛着我們。我呢，到我呼吸最後一口氣的時候，我還會愛他的，我永遠不會否認我是愛他的，並且我因爲你是他的兒子所以愛你，我在你面前是不能因爲他的緣故感着羞愧的！你懂得嗎？我不能夠！假使你要我留着的話，那你便要同意做他的兒子，並且我們要間或談到他，你要稍稍愛他，我們兩人互相看着的時候要想到他。如果你不願意的話，如果你不能夠的話，那便永别了，我的小寳寳，我們現在决不能留在一塊了！你要我怎樣我便怎樣。」</p>
<p>哲安以一種温柔的聲音回答道：</p>
<p>「留着，媽媽。」</p>

<h3>官迷和官荒</h3>
<p>— 立齋</p>
<p>今年在京平兩處分别舉行的文官考試，正式錄取了八百多人，向隅失敗的當在兩千左右。這現象不但說明中國知識分子之出路的艱難，而且說明中國國民中要做官的人，還是較其他任何職業的數字爲多。</p>
<p>其次，每遇華北政整會成立，湖北，江蘇或某某省政府改組的時候，那些榮膺大命的新貴們照例要登出「延攬有心，安插乏術」之擋駕的啓事，但在事實上，每一新貴所收到各方面薦人的八字，總是多則幾千，至少八百，還有中央和各政治中心的省會商埠的旅館，遇有某部院或省府改組的時候，照例是上下客滿，而這些一肩行李，滿腹希望的旅客們，十分之九都是不遠而來「找工作」（「做官」二字之「摩登」說法）的。凡此事實，一方面是反映「官迷」中人之深，雖然「革命」而仍是「牢不可拔」，一方面又是表示在這年頭，求「官」不得的人，比從前更多，因爲供過於求，以致發生「官荒」，而「官荒」問題對於國計民生的嚴重，實不在農村破產之下！</p>
<p>爲甚麽「官迷」之於人，比「主義信仰」之於人還更深入骨髓，寢饋不忘？因爲：就要做「官」的人的心理而言，顯然受了前此曾拜簡命的「官衆」們十分之九都大發其財的啓示，懂得做「官」的獲得，實在比一切士農工商的獲得爲多。次之，就一般人對於做「官」者的心理而言，還是大多欽而羡之，恰與蘇季子的嫂夫人的觀念相同——「以叔之位尊而金多也」？</p>
<p>爲甚麽「官荒」的現象弄得如此普遍而嚴重？因爲：第一，大家都要做官，自然不免「粥少僧多」，發生没得稀飯到嘴的和尙滿地亂鑽的現象。第二，中國的爲政常例，不是因事找人，而是因人派事，事務「官」的職業毫無保障，隨着政務「官」的去留而去留，老板的升沉旣然是「官途多幻」，小夥計們自然隨時有「綑舖　走路」的恐慌了。</p>
<p>「官荒」與日供深的結果，自然是「災官」遍中國！</p>
<p>「災官」在那裏去？這就要看「災官」品极的的高下而論。小「災官」因爲「官格」或「官面子」並不很嚴重，所以不妨改業，重新插入士農工商之中，甚至去拉黃包車。然而也有除了做「官」而外，竟一無所長或「官迷」太深，饑餓不能指「迷」的人，所以，我們時常看到災官「盡節」的消息。問題最嚴得的，就是簡任職以上的「大災官」。他們多是「三日無官·惶惶如也」！然而下臺容易，上臺最難。他們勢不能不於無出路中找出路，結果這些「大災官」，就變成「唯恐天下不亂」的政客。這些人心裏所想的和嘴裏所說的第一問題，就是「政局會有變動罷」？因爲要「變」，纔能有新的玩槍砲的人出來「順天應人」，必然打破一批現任「官」的飯碗而又使之「災官化」。而這些希一「變動」的「老災官」們，遂有無窮的機會，脫「災」免困，跳上舞臺。</p>
<p>以後，又像走馬燈似的，輪到新下臺的「災官」（大半已飽，其實不「災」，然而還是不願冷落）來希望「政局變動」·或製造「政局變動」。</p>
<p>「窮則變」·變變不已，而承受其「變」之「中華大舞臺」，遂不堪設想矣！</p>

<h3>談國貨年</h3>
<p>— 小生</p>
<p>去年在一個推銷國貨的ＸＸＸＸＸ會當一點小差使，一天到晚埋頭的寫，所寫的總不外是說外貨每年進口幾千百萬萬元，我國現在已到生死關頭，國人再不醒悟，國家就快亡了。以下就是鼓吹現在國貨的什麽什麽的好，什麽什麽的勝過舶來品。不過於我們驚惶不定的國民心理上，把亡國不亡國這種　子來狂喝，還不是一種最好的强心劑。反正他們以爲數十年在洋大人統治下的上海，安居樂業的，從没有經過一次恐慌，每年碰到天災人禍而逃來逃去的，祇有内地的苦命朋友，雖說一二八的那一遭，報紙上登得什麽什麽的驚人消息，其實住在租界裏的仍是太平無事，頭頂上雖有數十架飛機嗡嗡嗡的轉不停，彷彿在看電影鉅片「航空世界」，倒霉的祇有華界的閘北，成了一片焦土，因此不如把心來横一横，全國假使都成上海設的租界的話，不是就成個風調雨順，昇平氣象的世界嗎？所以有許多同胞，聽着了亡國不亡國的國貨宣傳，反而要提起了他們扳了石頭壓自己的脚的大感想。</p>
<p>記得，就是在去年的今日，正在聚精會神的忙着寫國貨年的大廣告，籌辦着元旦國貨年的汽車大遊行，滿想爆竹一聲　舊，在萬象更新的頌調下，國貨終可不脛而走暢銷全國，在我黃胄遺風的民氣之下，外貨自可絶跡，雖說這獨是我一個人打着如意算盤的奢想，但誰都相信，今年外貨進口，至少要比往年打一個折扣，可是國貨年總算由年頭而過到年尾了，據國際貿易局呈報政府的數字，一點不客氣的寫着入超四萬七千四百餘萬元，而且預計到年底要凑滿九萬萬元的數字，爲歷年來入超數字的最高紀錄，簡直是開通商以來未有之入超現象，我們貴國什麽都少進步，惟有對於入超數字，却每年都是後來居上的達到了空前的最高峯，這不知是不是足以表示國民物質文明之邁步前進，與大如英國某要人所謂「中國人民富厚於商業道德」了？</p>
<p>聽說明年民國二十三年，要改爲婦女國貨年，今日的報紙上已有幾個團體出而發起，大忙特忙的正在辦理向政府備案，并且又要於明年元旦，作大規模的汽車遊行了。談到今年國貨年的結果，好像澆上一盆冷水，大概在再接再厲而富於毅力提倡國貨的諸公們的眼光裏，以爲今年的出人意外，使人倒抽一口冷氣的結果，都是婦女們不帮忙的緣故。所以祇須要婦女們少塗些脂粉，少穿些舶來品的綢緞，那一定可以馬到成功的。但到底怎樣？那現在開始都没有，當然談不到結果，小生旣没有學過算命，更不會預言，祇好等到以後了。</p>
<p>但話是要說回來了。國家之亡與不亡，是不是全賴國民之採用國貨與否而定？這確是一個問題。但因意長紙短，祇可暫擱不談。現就退一百步一千步說：假使我國市場能夠斷絶外貨，那我想就是素來喜歡購用外貨的太太奶奶小姐們，老爺少爺官官們，難道就撞死在空的洋貨箱上不成？在另一方面，農民辛辛勤勤地耕種了一年的收穢，去了一切捐稅田賦，剩下的還不夠田地肥料的成本，工人們做了一天的苦工，還不足自己的一飽，他們在這種生活鞭條之下，對於日常必需用品，當然擇便宜者是圖，那裏有紳士般的細心，去辦别這個是國貨，那個是外貨？這是人同此心，心同此理的一會事。</p>
<p>婦女國貨年快要開始了，我們的希望，當然能夠得着一種良好的結果，但假使萬一仍和本年相伯仲的話，（這是萬一的話，决不是幸災樂禍，特此聲明。）那末在二十四年的國貨年，我第一個主張應改爲「軍人國貨年」，歷年來所發生不絶的内戰，和外國不知做了幾千百萬萬的生意，如果全國的軍閥老爺們，能夠因國貨年而改用國貨，更進而因國貨没有而大家不用，到那個時候，就不許外貨浸入我國市塲，决不是辦不到的事，而國貨呢，也可不必提倡而自然暢行了。</p>
<p>這雖然是一堆廢話，但，我想至少是幾萬萬小百姓的願望吧！</p>
<h3>彼一時此一時</h3>
<p>— 何處去</p>
<p>人一病人便總是這麽想，要是立刻地好了呢？便不行的事也可以做得了，難得很的事也可以做得了，就是自己最不喜歡的事也可以做得了。但是一等到人好了起來，話雖然還是記得的，做事的力也還是一樣的在，但是這顆心却怎樣也變了。總覺得這是『彼一時，此一時。』從前的說話祇是就着從前那種環境說着似地。</p>
<p>即是一般不得意的人也是一樣的。總以爲有一天自己得意了，性情就會慷慨些，錢也會常常出借的，待人總也會客氣些，汽車駛在馬路上怎樣都不會壓着窮人的。等到眞的得意了，事情可就兩樣了。慷慨換成了鄙吝，錢呢緊勒在腰包，待人是冷森森，好像要吃掉他似地。先頭說的話呢，就是記得的，但會用着各樣的理由去解釋牠。什麽慷慨是傻氣呀，儲蓄是必要的呀，待人是客氣不得的呀，汽車駛慢了會誤了事和多費油呀，等等的說話是像流水似地，不費一點思想就說出來了。</p>
<p>這是種什麽說法呢？想想看好像是很神秘似地。其實細想細想，也祇不過是種人性的兩面。一面是所謂爲著幻想預備的，一面却是爲着實際而預備的。因爲人總是難得想要顯達就顯達的。不顯達就難免不幻想，一幻想就好像不做個好人就不業似地；就是進了香，許了願也會得不着神靈的保佑似地。顯達了呢，自是這般這般可以不管的。祇要一登上了龍庭呢，先頭的說話，被人認做了廢話，認做了狗屁，也自由他啊！</p>
<h3>副刊的編者</h3>
<p>— 王慈</p>
<p>「天下奇味嘗來，無過副刋編者的苦！」</p>
<p>這句話，一不是「古人云」，二不是「ＸＸ格言」：却是經騐告訴我，呌我杜撰的。</p>
<p>那末，究竟苦在那裏呢，好，我來告訴你！</p>
<p>投來的稿件太多了，而副刋的篇幅祇那麽大，看看來稿，都是心血琢成的「傑作」，登了這一篇，不免捨了那一篇；於是，猶豫不决，心實苦之；此一苦也！</p>
<p>投來的稿件太少了，東併西凑，看看尙不足數，翻翻舊稿，都已失却了時間性；祇得自家來補白，於是借烟捲之力，以冀「七步成章」·「下筆千言」；不料慾望和事實常成相反：求之愈迫·成之愈緩！凝視稿紙，惘惘然無所成也！心實苦之，此二苦也！</p>
<p>親朋好友的稿件寄來，每有無登載價值者；可是，彼乃我之姻兄也！彼乃我之同學也！彼乃我之初交也！彼乃我之學生也！若登載之，深恐自失「報格」；若棄捨之，深恐自失「情誼」，輾轉思維，無策或適！心實苦之，此三苦也！</p>
<p>有一部份投稿者，其產量極宏；甚至每日必有其稿，惟佳者偏極少，雖不登載，然亦未能挫其投稿之毅力·其作品固欠佳，其精神誠可嘉！終於棄之不登，心每悁悁然不安；此四苦也！</p>
<p>選擇稿件偶一不愼，易能使善於「吹毛求疵」之批評家捕駁之，駡　　　雖忍氣呑聲，效法阿Ｑ之精神上的勝利法，然亦不無悵悵；此五苦也！</p>
<p>或稿後還添上幾句，我的家庭無力出錢讀書，全靠此投稿之費，以維持學業·或說經濟恐慌·務請多多登載，以維持生活，這樣可憐的態度，如何不使人心動呢，此六苦也！</p>
<p>或寫補白時過於恣意，無意中或觸動當局之怒，致申斥警告，以及……故執筆時常有戒於心，中心惴惴；此七苦也！</p>
<p>副刋編者之苦多矣！豈僅僅祇「七苦」哉！</p>
<h3>前樓底戲</h3>
<p>— 令令</p>
<p>又是一個該咒詛底失眠的夜裏；時鐘已經敲了兩下。我還是在一間狹小的後樓裏，用木板搭成的床舖上翻來覆去地睡不着，不知是近來天冷了棉被太薄的緣故，還是離别了一年多的神經衰弱症重發了。我眞爲自己担心，屢次想鎭靜地把一切思潮都摒掉，可是愈想鎭靜，心裏愈慌而愈睡不着。</p>
<p>過了一些時候，樓下後門響了，隨着就是談話上樓梯和咳嗽的聲音驚破了這靜的冷的深夜。我知道這是我的房東和他的太太回來了。前樓門開了，接着開電燈，開衣櫉，談笑，私語，開熱水瓶，倒水，笑又是吱吱的動情的女人輕聲的笑……陡然間，空氣是熱鬧得多了。但我倒因這陡然間空氣的轉變，腦經裏模糊了起來，有些飄飄然的感覺了。</p>
<p>「殺千刀的，你敢又來弄花槍；還我，你敢不還我！」還没曾睡沉，一聲尖銳的聲色俱厲的呌駡從前樓經過壁縫而傳到後房來，把剛踏進飄飄然的模糊的夢境裏的我重喚了回來。我像受了巨驚，把頭更伸出了些，耳朶用力地張着。</p>
<p>「說！你偷出去送給誰了？黑心喲，殺千刀的！還我，你還我呀！」還是女人的聲音，帶着哭駡的調子。</p>
<p>男的没有回音；女的嗚嗚地泣出聲來了，口裏咬着牙齒微微地呼駡着「殺千刀的，黑心鬼」。</p>
<p>大概是女的駡得太急了，把男的激怒了起來：「他媽的！」一聲霹靂似的咆哮，把板壁都震響了，「怎樣？是我拿了，送去給老子心愛的了，你預備怎樣？駡，你再駡，老子揍你！」</p>
<p>「殺千刀的，黑心鬼！偷了我的東西去買爛汚Ｘ的歡心，自己不認錯，你還想打我嗎？哼，你打，我看你打。」女的並不因對方的恐嚇而軟化下來。</p>
<p>「打，老子就打你！」拍，拍，是手掌和肉臉的接觸，清脆地，響亮地。「　　」　　　　的睡在地板上，她在滾，脚跟鼕鼕地打着樓板，　　尖銳地呌喊，夾着口痰和鼻涕聲；雖没有求饒，也不像先那樣强硬了：「好，你打，送給你打死，今晚你不打死我，你不算人！打死了我，好讓你殺千刀的短命鬼安安逸逸的把婊子爛汚Ｘ接進屋裏來尋快活……打，打得好……還要打，打，……救命呀，打死人啊！……」</p>
<p>男的一聲不響地把拳頭向地上滾着的身上無情地亂擊着，女的繼續的高聲哭喊：先還夾着强硬的呌駡，後來漸漸地悽愴地哭着「救命呀！打死人呀！」了。</p>
<p>這樣地又繼續了十來分鐘。這時，亭子間裏的嫂子，樓下前客堂裏的王先生夫婦，後客堂裏的張先生以及灶披間裏的盛大姑娘和她的講起話來嘴唇要顫抖的老姆媽，我不相信這班房客們還能夠安安樂樂地在他們的床舖上各自找尋各自的甜蜜的好夢：論理，我也不相信這悽愴的「救命」聲會振擊着他們的心而不發生什麽影響。然而這邊儘管喊，每個房間裏還是杳無聲息地没有一些動靜；我雖搬來才一星期，但這樣的事也慣常了，我知道是决不會有生命的危險的，於是我感着討厭，把頭埋進被窩裏，用兩個指頭塞着耳朶的孔道。</p>
<p>但是前面愈加鬧凶了，桌子，椅子，床都移了牠們原來的地位，茶盃，面盆也隨牠們的女主人在地上打滾，什麽東西擊着窗子，玻璃片掉下天井去了……男的呼「打」，女的喊「救」……。</p>
<p>忽然，男的把女的拖出門口夾道裏來了，亂擊着的聲響，就在我的床頭鬧着；事情大概弄嚴重了，光景是非第三者來解勸是不會休止的了。亭子間裏的嫂子，就在這迫切需要之下仗義出來了，然而她還只是站在她的房門口說着：</p>
<p>「夫妻間日裏好好的，有什麽大不了的事，三不兩時在深更半夜裏鬧架，眞是何苦來呢？」</p>
<p>没回音，仍然在打；于是她走上來，她邊拖着女的向房裏走一邊說：</p>
<p>「唉呀，眞是罪過，這冷的天氣，一層的單衫睡在地上，凍壞了怎樣，夫妻有話好說，眞何必這樣鬧呢……林先生讓她一點吧，你看她頭都給你打腫了……林嫂子，休息吧，有話明天再說。」</p>
<p>「亭子間裏的嫂嫂，你那裏知道，這潑婦眞是賤骨頭，讓不得的，今晚就是打死了她，我都不大服氣。」男子的話，顯然有些氣急。</p>
<p>但女的看見有人來了，而且在爲她辯護而責着對方，于是她也不再像剛才只呼喊求饒式的救命了，她哭着聲音說：「好，你再打，亨子間裏的嫂嫂，他偷了我的手鐲去送婊子，她還行凶要打！好，你看他短命鬼打死我吧……我苦也受夠了，我願意給你打死。……打呀……今晚不打死，你不算好漢！」</p>
<p>男的不響，似乎是又動手要打，但給亭子間裏的嫂嫂拖住了，「林先生，聽我的話吧，夜不行兵，什麽事，明天說吧，我們同居的也只可以這樣了，你們一定要鬧，鬧出人命來，我們也没有辦法。」</p>
<p>男的就住了，女的也怪聽話的不哭了，亭子間裏的嫂嫂也勝利的走回她亭子間裏去了。這裏，前樓，男的像是先上床去睡了，女的還是坐在桌子邊泣着。不久，就聽見關電燈的聲音。</p>
<p>空氣又意外的靜寂以，但這大騷動後的靜寂對我倒是一個重大的威脅！我更鎭靜地把薄的棉被裏着頭，但腦筋因身上感着麻痺的冷異常的清醒了起來，心裏更是慌得緊張，無論如何，再來不能把自己引進飄飄然的境地中了。</p>
<p>但是前樓鬧乏了的男女交應着，有時是混合着的鼾聲，響亮地又從壁縫裏傳到後房裏來。</p>

<h3>不容越俎代謀</h3>
<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>吾有一知友，在某影片公司做小工；去年八月，回到鄉間去娶親。這件婚烟，是父母之命，媒灼之言而成的；至今已經一年半過去了。因爲一在鄉間，一在上海，有許多不便，所以他將妻帶到上海來。剛巧吾有一間三層櫊，横是借不了，就借給他們住罷。不料他們二人，没有一天不打架，没有一天不吵鬧。弄得欲睡不能，這到也不容說了。還有一椿，他的妻子虚榮心很重。有一夜無意中，聽得他的妻駡道：「别人都着西裝，嫁着你這個窮光蛋，連西裝也没有着。」我朋友就也回答道：「我死了後，你去嫁洋裝朋友，隨你的便，今天我活在這裏，可就不容你了。可憐我的知友，回答這幾句話，被她大腿上咬得鮮血淋漓，跑路也不能跑了。他是做小工的人，一天到晚，是要行動的，如此情形，安能久計呢？眞是没有辦法，請先生指敎三條：</p>
<p>（一）還是與她在最短期間離婚呢？還是如何？</p>
<p>（二）吾友是做小工的人，目不識丁，着西裝當然是没有資格，如何辦呢？</p>
<p>（三）上海二房東，是有自由權的。如若不許他們住，對於吾友，是否有傷情誼？盼望在貴刋答覆，不勝欣幸之至，專此即頒</p>
<p>撰安　章高壽謹啓</p>
<p>編者按：章君的第一個問題，即使出於他知友自動，也不能成立；夫婦互哄，致成輕微傷，决不能成爲離婚的條件。如其他知友自己並無離婚的動機，那末章君絶對不能越俎代謀，或諷其實行。在這賣買式婚烟制度之下，一個小工，要娶妻子，是不容易的。你勸他離了，十九倒會反悔的。對付這種不明理的妻子，祇可用一些夫權，只要並不存心虐待，她動手時，還敬她幾下，未爲不可。在目下中國中下等社會裏，這法子是很普遍的；而且結果，也還不錯。夫婦的愛情，並不因之而决裂。萬一你的知友，眞的懦弱無能，你們旁邊人，做到助威恐嚇爲止，斷不能再進了。</p>
<p>第二個問題，那末當然没有去遷就她的道理。</p>
<p>第三個問題，能忍耐則忍耐之，以全友誼；到了忍無可忍，祇得聲明苦衷，請他搬走。你知友自然會自知其過，不來抱怨你了。</p>

<h3>上海（二八）</h3>
<p>— 張老三</p>
<p>（四十一）但願如此</p>
<p>小黃今天特别興奮，率天出出進進的忙得不堪交支。拉住一個人談不到幾句話，像有什麽重要事件似的和另一個人談話了，其實他所說的都是毫無相干的話。忽然他想起要去走走，没有得我的同意强嬲我往外跑。外面寒風吹的緊，路旁的小樹不勝被迫似的搖搖要垂，霞飛路得人那樣稀少，就是有路過的人，也都埋緊頭在大衣領内行色匆匆。平時直線條的異國女郎和穿着時色西裝的外國紳士，已不再那樣幽閒的在行人道上散步了，還有那輩專供水手們消遣的白俄遺族，也不再見她們賣俏的媚眼了。電車往來的接着汽車，那聲音在現在聽來覺得更形凄凉。我們低了頭，數着自己的步伐慢慢走去，不說話，活像兩個無家可歸的流浪人。</p>
<p>馬路兩旁的窗櫃内，聖誕節的裝飾在明亮的燈光下已失去了效力，聖誕老人負着各式的禮物獨自踏在棉花製就的雪景中，那樣孤獨，他没有能力攫住行路人的注視力還在其次，他悲哀幾天以後將被别的美的的飾物代替。一年一度迎接他的時候是那樣熱鬧，祇有幾天的光景，早被歡迎的人們遺棄了。</p>
<p>我兩手伸在袋中掏弄着幾個銅元自己都不明白會無聊的思量到這類的事實上去，隨手抽出一盒烟來，授一枝給小黃，兩個人同時停了步，兩顆頭磁在一起想抵禦寒風的侵入劃亮一個火。</p>
<p>「Mister」一聲不純粹的英語和一個黑影攔住在我們的面前</p>
<p>我輩起頭來，是一個白俄皇族的後裔，穿着一套破舊的西服，没有大衣没有打領，聳起了肩，舉手向着我們，一付寒酸乞憐的樣子。</p>
<p>「Sorry」我拍拍衣袋，我抽出一枝烟來授給他「Smoking?」</p>
<p>「ThankYou」！他接過烟，迅速地掏出火盒來打亮了火，那樣自然，給我吸着了烟。他退到一家俄國菜館的門前，將兩肩從的更高，幾乎瞧不清他的頭部。</p>
<p>我們繼續向前走去，瞧見他一道濃烟從不見頭的衣領中噴出來，接連着，不斷的。</p>
<p>「可憐」！我說。</p>
<p>「我們到那個時候，不知有拍拍衣袋的先生來佈施一枝香烟？」</p>
<p>「小黃，今天你好像失了知覺。」</p>
<p>「眞的。我們的生活太没有保障，這幾天上海的情形，謠傳蠡起，有一天帝國主義的大砲向閘北侵略的時候，我們……」他停止了，似乎接不上適當的話。</p>
<p>「自從萬案以來」，我說「帝國的野心已暴露無遺，瀋陽之夜更接皇家軍趾高氣揚，不過，——上海，我想還不至於……」</p>
<p>「但願如此」。</p>

<h3>好萊塢的珠光寳氣</h3>
<p>— 福</p>
<p>可惜都藏在保險庫裏不可拿出來</p>
<p>據專家的估計總值在兩千萬左右</p>
<p>大家都知道好萊塢明星們的闊綽和浪費，那末他們於窮奢極慾之中，當然不能没有亮晶晶的東西，來點綴他們身體的各部份。那些亮晶晶的東西，最值錢的當然是金鋼鑽，次之就是各式各樣的寳石和珍珠。金銀之屬，那就不在其數了。但是你們曉得不曉得，好萊塢這些明星們，有多少鑽石珠寳，據落杉磯的一個大珠寳商的估計，好萊塢在珠寳方面的投資，一共有一千五百萬美金之鉅。還有一位好萊塢的珠寳商人，他說好萊塢所有的珠寳，合計起來，總在兩千萬美金左右。這兩位珠寳商人，是好萊塢大宗珠寳的供給者。他們在營業上的調查，當然是很有根據的。</p>
<p>但是很可憐的，有了精圓的珍珠項圈，大鑽石的鐲子，戒指等，都不能帶，而必須鎖在大銀行裏的大鋼庫裏。有空的時候，跑到銀行，打開自己的首飾小匣子，作片刻的摩沙把玩，又重新珍重放好了，鎖好了，空手出來。這正如疼瘩子女，把他們養在醫院裏，難得去看一鋿，還有依依不捨哩。但是珠寳的好萊塢，究竟是不妥當，然以前已經有許多人被刦過。頂著名的幾次就是柴博馬克斯，梅蕙絲，侮倫者斯泰珞，蓓蒂康遜，幾位明星的遭遇不測。因此他們都害怕得，不敢將眞的珠寳，顯露於衆人之前了。</p>
<p>惟一的例外，是露潑范　（LupeVelez）。她是「蠻女天堂」的主角著名的墨西哥的貓，大膽而潑辣的一個女子。她不怕强盜。她並且自己身上偑着手槍，預備和强盜抵抗。還有一個隨身的護衛，就是「人猿泰山」裏當人猿的威斯穆勒（JohnnyWeissmller），也就是她的愛人。他們的結婚，已經傳說很久了。</p>
<p>論到好萊塢衆明星之中，收藏最豐富的，大家都說是茂黛維絲（MariouDavis）。據專家的估計，總在二十五萬至五十萬美金之間。本年經濟凋敝之中，大家都鬧窮，惟獨茂琳黛維絲還能拿出錢來，收買珠寳。最近她又從一個紐約珠寳商人的手裏，買了一個祖母綠的鐲子，和一個同樣東西的别針，價錢總在四萬美金左右。茂琳黛維絲收藏雖這樣富，但她自已却不敢帶，除非在極小的私人集會中。她從前是極隨便的，常常在銀狐大衣上别了一個大寳石，掛在大戲院的更衣室裏。有一次她正在拍着戲，她隨便將胸口的一個大别針往一個新聞記者的衣袋裏一塞，過後也就忘了。後來那位新闻記者回到家裏，他的夫人掏着他的衣袋，尋出那件寳石鑽石鑲嵌的别針，和他大鬧了一陣。後來幸虧他想起來了茂琳黛維絲，就奔去還給了她。茂林還是很不在乎似的，其實那個别針還值一萬五千美金哩。</p>
<p>還有一位浪漫明星潘琪霍金斯嬌意絲（ＰeggyHopkinsJoyce），她的收藏或者還在茂琳黛維絲之上。但她自己說，她的東西不敢帶到好萊塢來。她的收藏大多存在芝加哥的銀行保管庫裏。有的存在巴黎。頂著名的一顆嬌意絲鑽石，本來是一位印度王子以有的，重量有一百五十開，價值在五十萬美金以上。還有一串珍珠，她在歐洲買了，但是她將它存在巴黎。據說是因爲那串珍珠的進口稅，就要八萬美金，她說她付不起！嬌意絲是多少次離過婚的。這許多東西，都係幾個卸任的丈夫買給她的，不過有了不敢帶，也就太可憐了。她亦不願帶假東西，據說不是眞的，帶在身上没有興趣的。</p>
<p>提到了因離婚而發財的，還有一位凱茀蘭西絲（KayFrancis）。她亦有兩件寳貝，一個是祖母綠的戒指，一個是一顆大鑽石。都是兩位前任的丈夫的紀念物。這兩件東西，現在亦存在紐約一家銀行裏，没有敢帶到好萊塢來。此外在茂琳黛維絲之下的，要算是塔梅治（Talmadge)家的姊妹了。其餘的星期，像瓊克勞馥，開珞龍巴，都有很徝錢的東西，也都是存在銀行裏，不可顯露出來的。其餘的更不必說了。</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3>評「兄弟血」</h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>—安文公司出品　北京戲院開映—</p>
<p>假使我們承認中國電影確是進步了，那末這資本比較雄厚的大公司才有其適當的成績，而許多小公司，却仍舊是没有方法進展。這不僅是中國會有如此現象，例如美國的哥倫比亞公司，一般的都趕不上米高梅或其他資本雄厚的大公司。</p>
<p>但是我總以爲不管公司小到如何程度，至少對於影片的故事，總應當弄得好一點兒的。我們對於哥倫比亞老是武俠片，覺得不能不引起我們的反感，便是這個原故。</p>
<p>「兄弟血」這一影片，可以說自編劇以至於演出，都是非常幼稚可笑的，特别是寃寃相報的故事。</p>
<p>我們想想看罷，一味的描寫庸俗的愛情，已經是淺薄的表現了，何况在　原不知道「神聖愛情」爲何物的男女口中，一定要他們忠實於誠實的愛情；或是將男女間單純的事物，企圖寫成天仙一般，不能不使人發笑。加之以「害人先害己…天網難逃」等腐迂之談來解說妒殺好案，尤其是陳舊俚俗之至。</p>
<p>就演出來說，那末好像小學生作文一樣，我們只求其通順，不過「兄弟血」的導演連這一點都没有做到，遑論其他？</p>
<p>然而再降低一點水凖來說罷，那末樹頭小鳥的一個畫面，還好看。此外小地方的錯誤，簡直是不可勝數。</p>
<p>我希望「兄弟血」的作者諸君，多多努力一點。</p>
<h3>「風塵艷遇」評</h3>
<p>— 摩爾</p>
<p>Last　Trail</p>
<p>「英雄美人」的羅曼斯·富於戲劇性，而爲電影作家的採取，已經不是最近的事了。因爲這種影片空想，並且公式已經漸漸的給觀衆厭棄了，但是電影製作者，似乎没有完全抛棄這一類故事，所以在西部片消沉的現在，我們還看到這張「風塵艷遇」。</p>
<p>一般的對於武俠影片的批評，已經夠充份了。同時，因爲這一類影片的「刻版了」（比公式化更公式）關於這一類的電影批評，也不得不比較重複；這點雖則不能拿來證實電影批評的公式化，但至少是「浪費」，因爲觀衆們，早已成了最正確最嚴厲的批評者了。</p>
<p>因爲内容的陳舊，新的形式，自然不會產生的。我們的導演，處理這一故事，首先應該提出的就是經濟。他把故事的素材先集中起來，然後去其枝葉，這是因爲導演者，也知道一切武俠片的遭受觀衆厭惡，如果再把許多舊場面，充份的舖張只有增深觀衆厭惡，所以，他只是快速簡明的叙述。</p>
<p>但是「風塵艷遇」的製作者雖則放棄了很多呌人厭惡的地方，隨即他又墮入另一個魔道中。那就是滑稽的加入，這在他也許以爲去了枝葉的故事，太單調了所以加些笑料來調濟一下。却不料這種惡劣的不合理的做作，是只有破壞空氣的。</p>
<p>在「風塵艷遇」的本身，寫到這裏爲止。以下我想說明現代美國的武俠影片，和「唐吉訶德」的比較。「唐吉訶德」，無論小說的作者，或則電影的作者，同樣的對「唐吉訶德」的命運表示同情的。而現代美國電影的製作者，却完全是對於「仗義疎財」的俠客的幻想。在「唐吉訶德」中，我們看到古騎士的没落。所以，比較有眞實性，而現代美國武俠片，簡直是白天的幻夢，一點眞實性也没有。假使拿眞實性批評作品的價值，那末，這中間是容易明白的。</p>
<p>武俠片是交上没落的命運了。在這裏，我們看到了電影的未來！</p>
<p>觀衆意見</p>
<h3>我對「惡鄰」的意見</h3>
<p>— 甫</p>
<p>一向專以攝製「關東大俠」及「女鏢師」的月明影片公司。近來也改變了作風，而攝製時代的作品了。</p>
<p>嚴格地說：「惡鄰」的意識和劇情，感到太理想了太錯綜複雜了。最糟的，就是還插入了一段什麽（？）「崑崙山女俠」，來一塲打武，而犯了固有的毛病。這不得不爲月明公司惜。不過，對於本片的劇本的作者的動機，是仍很可欽偑的。</p>
<p>一張影片，當然不全靠意識上的正確。而演員的努力，也是有一部份關係的。「惡鄰」中的幾位演員，第一個努力，就是張雨亭，王飛娟，也很好。何非光的陰險還不差。</p>
<p>導演手腕還不差。攝影較之以前，是好得多了。總之，這張「惡鄰」較之月明公司以前幾張是得多了。即在各小公司中亦已很難得。</p>
<h3>「惡隣」我評</h3>
<p>— 丁玎</p>
<p>出我意料之外的是攝影。非但不像一般人想像中小公司的出品，並且也足以和大公司的出品一較短長。除了有幾個鏡頭光線太强了一點，全部片子，都異常清晰可愛，換幕的方法亦很新頴别緻。</p>
<p>導演手段遠靈活，他能利用些小技巧給觀衆一點趣味。不過有兩點使我不得不疑惑的。</p>
<p>（一）那養蠶的黃猷家，究竟在鄉下呢，還是和黃華仁同在一個繁華的都市之中？在繁華的都市中養着蠶已有些勉强，要是在鄉下穿了西裝養蠶，恐怕更不合實際吧！並且爲什麽流氓個個都要着一身破西裝？</p>
<p>（二）一個晚上，黃華仁和質華在花園中賞月的時候，都穿的單衣服。但是不久以後，質華拉着華仁出去買玉瓶，質華的身上却已穿了皮的短外衣了。氣候難道變得這樣快嗎？</p>
<p>演員方面，飾黃華仁的和飾鄔質華的都合身份，尤以飾僕人蔡馬夫的，動作自然，没有飾僕人的做作態度。飾國芬的似乎太少表情。</p>
<p>最後我該說一句：「惡隣」總是值得我們一看的。</p>

<h3>上海２４小時（七）</h3>
<p>— 田夫</p>
<p>屋子裏的空氣沉悶到像要炸裂。遠遠地傳來的汽笛聲報告着時候已經正午。老陳的女人悲哀地昂起頭來，她想着：死者的姊姊還在廠裏淌着汗做工哩，這一家子的運命……</p>
<p>默默地流着淚的老趙忽然出聲了，問陳大的妻：「他的哥哥怎麽不回來？」</p>
<p>「他？」老陳的妻睜大了眼睛，像頭上着了個炸彈：「天不生眼的！昨夜買辦家裏失了竊，偏說是他……把他抓進牢裏去了。」接着，她又幽靈似的獨白着：「一個死，一個在牢裏，……一家都完了……完了，一切都完了……」</p>
<p>這麽說着的時候，老趙的面色忽然起了突變：一陣子通紅，一陣子又變得鐵青，汗涔涔地從頭上流下來。他不想偶然做了一次「肖行的老鼠」竟累着了自己的朋友。他深深地苦悶着，他覺得有一種巨大的暴力在蹂躪着他的靈魂。老陳的女人驚異地看着他。他狂暴地呌：「那東西是我偷的，那東西！我不能連累你們，我去自首！我去自首！」</p>
<p>她驀然從驚疑中領悟到這事情的内幕時，老趙已經像失了人性的野獸般，向門外狂奔去了。</p>
<p>（十）平凡的一天</p>
<p>兩個鐘頭以後。糊裏糊塗地被關在監牢裏的老陳正在焦灼着，暴燥着：忽然獄卒押枷了老趙跑進牢裏來。他驚奇地望望老趙，老趙却向他微笑着過去了。他正疑惑：老趙怎麽也被抓了進來？而另一個獄卒却忽然進來，把自己釋放了。</p>
<p>一隻逃出樊籠的小鳥似地，老陳飛奔着回家。</p>
<p>老陳的女人看見她的男人忽然回來，她覺得驚疑，也感到了一絲寛慰；可是她想到丈夫被釋放的原因，老趙高呌着「我去自首」以後狂奔着出去情景在腦際迅速的閃過；她又感動得突然哭泣了。</p>
<p>老陳的眼睛死死地釘在那張小床上，他們失去了生命的弟弟驅壳，僵直地挺在那裏：床上燃着兩支香。香烟裊裊地向空間升，升化到人目看不見。老陳的心却老是跟着往下沉，沉，沉……</p>
<p>時間平凡地過了一天：四點鐘了。大都會的動脈依然劇烈地跳動。買辦太太又起來了床，喝着鷄汁，心裏想着怎麽狂歡地消磨這一夜？</p>
<p>汽車，洋樓，女人，消魂的舞……</p>
<p>失業，受傷，坐牢監，死……</p>
<p>每天，每天，晝晝夜夜循環着。上海是永遠那麽熱鬧，燦爛，輝煌。……（完）</p>

As for the Fourth Plenary Session, the various committees in the Southwest stated that if they are not restricted by their duties at that time, they are all willing to come to Beijing to attend. I have not heard of the rumor that only Cui Guangxiu and other four people are designated to come to Beijing. Distant roads hinder and rumors are often inaccurate.

When passing through Shanghai yesterday, I met with Cai Ziming, Kong Yongzhi, Wu Tiecheng, and others, and also had discussions. After a short rest in Beijing, I will go to Jiangxi to meet with Chairman Chiang.

<h3>U.S. Ratifies Silver Agreement and Relief of Domestic Panic (English)</h3>
<p>According to a Washington dispatch on the 21st of this month, the U.S. government has ratified the silver agreement signed by various countries at the London Economic Conference. It also ordered the people to send newly mined silver to the mint, half of which is paid to the government, managed by the national treasury, as minting fees and handling fees, and half of which is returned to the original owner after being minted into silver coins. Since the London Silver Agreement was established on July 22 of this year, it took four months for the Indian government to ratify it, and five months for the U.S. government to subsequently ratify it. According to the original agreement, the agreement must be ratified by the governments of various countries before April 1, 1934, in order to take effect. However, silver-producing countries will not lose their binding force due to the failure of one or more countries to ratify it. Therefore, as far as the silver agreement is concerned, the U.S. government's move to ratify it at this time is only the fulfillment of the contracting procedures. Moreover, since the U.S. is the largest silver-producing country and India is the main silver-using country, the former's obligation under the agreement is to purchase 24 million ounces of mined silver annually, and the latter's obligation under the agreement is to sell no more than 35 million ounces of silver annually. Now that both countries have been able to ratify it one after another, the ratification of other countries will naturally not be much of an obstacle, and the future of the silver agreement can be expected to be established.</p>
<p>The conclusion of the Silver Agreement was an attempt by some countries at the World Economic Conference to maintain silver prices through international action as a way to solve panic, especially with the ambition of the United States being the most obvious. The basic spirit of the agreement lies not in whether the contracting countries can unanimously ratify it, but in whether the price of silver can be raised to achieve a high level and whether the prices can have an upward trend after the implementation of the agreement. This is indeed the mission that the World Economic Conference wanted to fulfill at that time, and it is also the result that the United States, which advocated the conclusion of this agreement, wanted to obtain the most. Therefore, this point is the most important. However, if we can slightly examine the fundamental cause of today's world economic panic, we will know that the U.S.'s method of relief will not only be fruitless in the future, but may even increase the plunder of various countries' positions and more than enough. The fundamental difficulty of today's world economy is actually due to the number of production exceeding effective demand. And the reason why effective demand cannot go up is due to the weakness of the purchasing power of the general society. Therefore, goods are piled up like mountains and cannot be sold. This is the reason why prices fall. Prices fall is the result, not the cause. Now, at a time when the domestic economy is in extreme panic, the U.S. wants to use the markets of colonial countries in the Far East as the tail end of dumping, thinking that this will raise the price of silver, and increase the purchasing power of the Far East. However, in fact, let alone whether the price of silver can be raised, there is still a huge question. Even if it can be raised, can it be said that the consumption of the people of the Far East can be developed as a result? Is there such certainty? What if the economy of the Far East is still declining as before, and the market cannot be opened as before? The lack of sales of goods will inevitably lead to no improvement in prices. The cause and effect are clear, and the reason is inevitable. Isn't it observed that the United States has launched a gold purchase policy since October of this year? First, it bought gold domestically, then manipulated exchange rates abroad, and controlled gold prices. However, the effect has not been achieved and the panic is still panic. Can the result of the silver purchase policy not be a continuation of the gold purchase?</p>
<h3>Former French Prime Minister Herriot Supports League of Nations Declaration</h3>
<p>Opposes Undermining the Principle of International Equality</p>
<p>Franco-German Harmony is Key to European Peace</p>
<p>(Paris) The "Economic and Financial News" will publish an important article by Herriot tomorrow, roughly stating, "We have always believed that each country's internal affairs should be determined by its own people. Therefore, even if Germany is ruled by Hitlerism, we do not harbor any prejudice against it. If someone asks me whether Stresemann (former German Foreign Minister) or Hitler is better, I would rather take Hitler's attitude, because judging from the recently published Stresemann notes, Stresemann's character is not as straightforward as Hitler's. If France and Germany can harmonize or even just maintain the status quo, it would be enough to consolidate peace. However, if Germany claims the right to assert its ideals, then France also has the right to express its views." Herriot then stated that the League of Nations was founded on liberalism, and its purpose was to create international law and international morality based on the equality of all nations. Since the establishment of the League of Nations, Mussolini of Italy and Hitler, the German Chancellor, have advocated various theories to oppose it. In reality, these theories are nothing more than an attempt to abolish the principle of international equality and replace it with an unorganized international situation. Herriot continued, "France will oppose any international policy that seeks to restore the old secret diplomacy. During the Great War from 1914 to 1918, the reason why France was able to obtain so much valuable assistance was precisely because it had always been loyal to the world's cultural and beneficial undertakings for mankind. We must not forget this. We believe that international policy can only be based on the League of Nations Covenant, and the Covenant must be fully observed. We are more determined to adhere to this policy now than at any other time, and we also hope that all issues related to the future of all nations can be discussed publicly in the world's public opinion," and so on.

<h3>1935 Naval Disarmament Conference</h3>
<p>Japan Prepares to Fight Tooth and Nail for Equality</p>
<p>British and American Governments Begin Preliminary Preparations</p>
<p>Conference Location Still Undecided</p>
<p>Roosevelt May Convene the Conference</p>
<p>(Washington) As preliminary preparations for the 1935 Naval Disarmament Conference begin, key figures in the US government believe that Japan's desire for equality with Britain and the United States may become the biggest problem, causing the naval stability that has existed for the past ten years to return to instability. At a time when the treaty for the stability of Pacific politics is on the verge of collapse, if the instability of the Pacific navy is recreated, like the long-standing dispute over naval equality between France and Italy, it would be the most regrettable thing in the future. Secondly, the location of the naval conference is also undecided. London, Geneva, and Washington have already hosted naval conferences. Logically, the rotation should be in Tokyo, but Tokyo has limited hotels, and it is also very unfavorable that representatives from various East Asian countries would have to travel a great distance at great expense. In addition, it is expected that the Japanese may raise political issues, such as recognizing the puppet organization. At that time, if an agreement has been established between China and Japan, Japan's position will be greatly strengthened. However, if other countries oppose discussing political issues, another conference may be convened to discuss it. Observing the US President's attention to the navy, it is quite possible that the 1935 conference will be convened by the US President. Furthermore, the size of warships will also become a point of contention, regardless of the ratio between the three countries. Japan believes that smaller ships are less expensive and have less long-range attack power. The United Kingdom, on the other hand, believes that smaller ships are easier to distribute for defense because its colonies are scattered and require a greater number of ships. Therefore, both countries advocate for smaller ships. Japan has suggested a maximum of 25,000 tons for battleships with 14-inch guns, and a maximum of 8,000 tons for cruisers with 8-inch guns. The United Kingdom has indicated that it wants to limit cruisers to 7,000 tons with 6-inch guns, and battleships should also be small. The United States, on the other hand, believes that because the east and west coasts are separated by the mainland, and the islands are far away, it advocates for larger ships with longer range overseas. In addition, Britain and the United States want to abolish submarines, but Japan does not want to. Japan wants to abolish aircraft carriers and prohibit the construction of aircraft landing platforms on warships, while the United States wants to maintain these weapons. In all these ways, the three countries will fight tooth and nail because their interests are at stake, even without the issue of equality. (National Telegram, 25th)</p>
<h3>Countries Compete to Expand Armaments, France Would Rather Not Fall Behind</h3>
<p>—Editorial from Le Temps in Paris—</p>
<p>(Paris) Under the title "Naval Revival," Le Temps commented on the naval competition among countries, roughly stating that some believe that the French army should be reduced to the limits requested by certain friendly countries and former enemy countries. Although those who say this do not dare to force France, their desire to have us disarm is sincere. However, there are some countries that appear to be peaceful, but in reality, their naval construction policies have recently become very active, which is very obvious. We cannot help but point this out. France is the least worried about this matter. Major naval powers such as Britain, the United States, and Japan are free to expand their naval armaments if they believe it is essential for their security. France does not originally intend to comment, but what is the purpose of these countries expanding their navies and then using a false sense of disarmament to sensationalize? Le Temps then stated that Britain, a friend of France, has reduced its defense spending for several years, especially naval spending. Can Britain's actions really make other countries follow suit? Look at the North American Republic, a brother nation of Britain, which advocates for peace again and again, but since the European War, the United States has recently passed a naval construction plan for as many as forty ships, and has not stopped its plan because of Britain's reduced military spending. Furthermore, looking at Japan across the Pacific, it is also completing its naval construction to the maximum extent permitted by the naval treaties. Britain's attitude is not enough to stop it. Le Temps then stated that the United States, seeing the naval competition between Japan and the United States, has had to use up the quota granted to Britain by the naval treaties to build warships that are larger than originally planned. As for Germany's naval construction plan, it has not been relaxed either. For several years, there has been a movement in the German naval circles and public opinion advocating the establishment of a strong navy, the construction of 10,000-ton cruisers and submarines, and the promotion of naval aviation. From this, it can be seen whether France's military preparedness can be reduced or not. (Havas Dispatch, 25th)</p>
<h3>US Marine Corps Urgently Needs to Expand Its Strength</h3>
<p>Major General Fuller Makes a Suggestion</p>
<p>(Washington) Major General Fuller, Commandant of the US Marine Corps, recommended in his annual report that 1,800 men be added to increase the total strength of the Marine Corps to 17,000, stating that the current strength of the corps is insufficient to meet its responsibilities. In addition, 35 percent of the majors and captains in the corps have not been promoted for thirteen years, which is almost double the number of years for naval officers of the same rank. Therefore, it is urgent to request Congress to approve the expansion so that they can be promoted. (National Telegram, 25th)</p>

<h3>Unexpected Visit to Austria by Undersecretary</h3>
<p>Vienna Italian Undersecretary for Foreign Affairs Suvich will soon visit Austrian Prime Minister Dollfuss. According to news from Innsbruck, Suvich had previously discussed the issue of reconciliation between Germany and Austria with the German government during his visit to Germany, inquiring about Germany's views and making the maintenance of Austria's independence a major condition. However, it is said that Berlin replied, "Austria should not take provocative measures against the Nazi Party, so as to cause conflict. Austria should first revoke all measures taken." If Suvich's visit to Berlin can create a favorable environment, he will come to Austria ahead of schedule. Now Suvich's mission to Germany can be said to have been ineffective. Therefore, after coming to Austria, he will no longer mediate the conflict between Germany and Austria, and will only discuss issues directly related to Italy and Austria. (Havas Dispatch, 25th)</p>

<h3>Two European Countries Encounter Misfortune This Christmas</h3>
<p>France Mourns Train Accident Nationwide</p>
<p>President of Catalonia, Spain, Passes Away</p>
<p>(London) Two European countries encountered misfortune during Christmas and were in mourning. One was France, which mourned the La Haye train accident nationwide, and the other was Spain, where President Macià of Catalonia passed away yesterday at the age of 74. Macià fought for Catalan autonomy for 27 years before achieving his goal. During this time, he suffered greatly, experiencing insults, exile, and imprisonment. Now that he has passed away due to old age, the people are all saddened, and the entire city of Barcelona has lowered its flag to half-mast. (Reuters Dispatch, 26th)</p>
<h3>The Scene of the La Haye Train Accident is More Tragic Than the Battle of the Somme</h3>
<p>Wooden Cars Could Not Withstand the Violent Impact</p>
<p>The Number of Casualties Continues to Rise</p>
<p>The number of casualties in the La Haye train accident continues to rise. According to the latest official report, the number of deaths has reached 217, and there will probably be more deaths, as 100 of the 300 injured are in critical condition. Currently, 150 coffins have been placed in the Ardante Church in Donggal. President Lebrun has already gone there early this morning. Many corpses have not been claimed and have not been buried. A cabinet member visited the scene of the accident and said that the scene was more tragic than the worst battle situation in the Saar region. The reason why there were so many deaths and injuries in this accident was that the cars of the Nancy express train were made of wood, while the cars of the Strasbourg express train were made of steel. Therefore, after being hit, they were almost reduced to powder. The authorities have now begun investigating the cause of the accident in Miwocher. (Reuters Dispatch, 26th)</p>
<h3>Funeral Held for the Corpses</h3>
<p>(Paris) The victims of the train accident in La Haye will be buried on Tuesday. Public Works Minister Paganon will deliver a speech on behalf of the government. (Havas Dispatch, 25th)</p>
<h3>Countries Send Condolences</h3>
<p>(Paris) After the train accident in La Haye, heads of state and prime ministers of various countries sent telegrams of condolence to President Lebrun and Prime Minister Chaudemps. Gu Weijun, the Chinese ambassador to France, also expressed his condolences to Foreign Minister Pongou. (Havas Dispatch, 25th)</p>
<h3>Investigate the Cause of the Accident</h3>
<p>La Haye The investigation court began preliminary hearings on the train accident case today. According to the vehicle inspector, all warning signals on the route had been properly arranged. In addition, the gatekeeper testified that he was asleep at the time of the accident. Before the accident, the train that was hit was near the station. Because the visibility was poor, it used the locomotive's warning device to emit a special sound. Not long after, it heard the express train coming like a whirlwind and told his wife, "A disaster is about to happen." Before he could finish speaking, the two trains had collided. The preliminary investigation magistrate found that the speed of the train that arrived later should not have exceeded 93 kilometers per hour, but that night it reached 105 kilometers per hour.

<h3>President Macià of Catalonia, Spain, Leaves Love Among the People</h3>
<p>The Remains Will Be Buried Today</p>
<p>Barcelona, Spain The remains of the late Colonel Macià, President of the Autonomous Government of Catalonia, are covered with the provincial flag and guarded by four cavalrymen in front of the coffin. Members of the Provincial Assembly and some young people who fled abroad with Macià during the imperial era also joined in turn. The announcement of Macià's death has been officially sent by the Provincial Government to the mayors of the province and the consuls of various countries here. The funeral is now scheduled to take place at 8:00 AM on Wednesday, with grand ceremonies that are likely unprecedented in the city of Barcelona. More than 50,000 people from various provinces will come to attend the funeral. Countless telegrams of condolences and wreaths have been sent. Yesterday, all theaters and cinemas in the city were silent for one minute to express mourning. In one theater, a spectator who did not want to stand up to pay respects was almost beaten to death by other spectators and was only rescued by the police. (Havas Dispatch, 26th)</p>
<h3>Impact on the Spanish Political Situation is Unfavorable to the Future of Catalan Autonomy</h3>
<p>Barcelona, Spain After the death of Colonel Macià, President of the Provincial Government, there will be a major impact on the political situation in Catalonia and throughout Spain. The provincial government is controlled by the left-wing Republican Party, and Macià was the leader of the party, with a high reputation. Not only did the party members follow him, but other parties were also in awe of him. When Macià was alive, the disagreements between the parties were suppressed. After Macià's death, conflicts may arise. However, since a few days ago, there has been talk of an understanding between the autonomists and the left-wing Republican Party. Once this matter is realized, it may reduce the difficult situation. (The difference between the opinions of the autonomists and the left-wing Republican Party lies not in the original intention, but in the method of implementation.) This is from the perspective of Catalan politics. As for the entire Spanish situation, the recent election results show that the political situation is shifting to the right, and the new parliament is not very favorable to Catalan autonomy. The political leader of the province who can unite the Catalan people is Macià. Therefore, Macià's death can be said to have a great impact on the entire Spanish political situation. There are different opinions about Macià's successor, but the Spanish ambassador to Belgium, Alberto (name) Salvador (surname), is the most popular. All parties seem to be sympathetic to Salvador.

<h3>British King's Christmas Broadcast</h3>
<p>Britain is Trending Towards Recovery with Significant Progress</p>
<p>Encourages the People to Use New Science to Improve Old Habits</p>
<p>(London) The British King issued his Christmas broadcast from Norfolk Palace today, informing Britons all over the world. When the broadcast was made, the Queen and the Crown Prince listened to it from a separate room with a transmitter, as even the Queen and others did not know the content of the broadcast beforehand. The British King said that the most meaningful development of the past year was the daily application of goodwill in the outlook and policies. This application has been made possible by the progress of new science, because science has allowed us to understand that the old habits of thought and behavior are now outdated and have no room to exist. The gifts of science will be of no value unless my people have sound patience and goodwill. The past year has shown a trend towards recovery, which, although not very significant, is a more stable progress than before. At the end, the British King blessed the children of the world with the words "God bless you all." According to telegrams from New York, Sydney, and India, the British King's broadcast was heard very clearly everywhere. (Reuters Dispatch, 25th)</p>

<h3>Armenian Church Bishop in New York Stabbed and Dies</h3>
<p>Conflict Between New and Old Schools of Thought</p>
<p>Two Criminals Arrested on the Spot</p>
<p>(New York) A tragedy occurred in an Armenian church here today. While Bishop Turan was holding a Christmas prayer service, two people suddenly stepped forward and stabbed Bishop Tuolan with sharp knives. He died shortly after. It was found that Bishop Tuolan was the leader of the Armenian Church in North America. The two murderers were arrested by the police. One was Legeledin, the main culprit, and the other was Fajisheng, an accomplice. Both were grocers and belonged to the old school in the Armenian Church, while Bishop Tuolan was a new school figure who supported the Soviet Russian system. The two schools of thought were different, resulting in this tragedy. (Reuters Dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(New York) Bishop Turan came to New York to preside over religious affairs after Armenia established a republic under the guidance of Soviet Russia. He usually supported Soviet Russia, which aroused the antipathy of the opposition. Bishop Turan was usually accompanied by guards. Yesterday, when he was leading the crowd in worship at the altar, a person suddenly got up from his seat and went straight to the altar. One of them drew a knife and stabbed him. Hundreds of people in the church were shocked. All four people have now been detained by the police. (Reuters Dispatch, 25th)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) The 65th session of the Diet was held at 11:00 AM today with the Emperor present. (Den Tsushin Dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) At the opening ceremony of both houses of the Diet today, the Emperor bestowed the following imperial message to both houses: "I am now carrying out the opening ceremony of the Imperial Diet, and I inform the members of the House of Peers and the House of Representatives that the relationship between the Empire and the allied countries has become even closer. I am deeply pleased. I have ordered the Ministers of State to submit the budget for the ninth year of Showa and various bills to the Imperial Diet. I hope that you will understand my intentions, deliberate in harmony, and exhaust your duties of cooperation." (Den Tsushin Dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The House of Representatives opened a negotiation meeting among various factions at 10:00 AM today to coordinate on the proposal to celebrate the birth of the Crown Prince. As a result, it opened the main meeting at 1:25 PM, passed the imperial message response text first, and then passed the following congratulatory text. The presentation date will be decided by Speaker Akita. The meeting was adjourned at 1:53 PM.

<p>(Tokyo) The first meeting of the leaders of the Seiyukai and Minseito parties was held yesterday at the Momijikan in Shiba. From the Seiyukai side, Minister of Commerce and Industry Nakajima and 13 others, including Tokonami Takejiro, Mochizuki Keisuke, Kuhara Fusanosuke, and Yamamoto Jotaro, attended. From the Minseito side, 10 people, including Machida Chuji, Kobashi Itta, and Tomita Kojiro, attended. First, Minister of Commerce and Industry Nakajima delivered a speech saying that some people in Japan have various opinions about political parties. However, the constitution is strictly observed and parliamentary politics is recognized, so it goes without saying that constitutional government is operated on the basis of political parties. However, at this time of internal and external troubles, when there is a need to unify national opinion, it is regrettable that there is a situation of vertical opposition among various important forces guiding the national destiny. At this time, it is fortunate for the country that the executives of the Seiyukai and Minseito parties meet in one hall to have friendly talks and deliberate on national affairs in order to facilitate the communication of intentions. Next, Tokonami Takeichiro gave a speech saying that he agreed with the owner's words. He did not think that some people were criticizing this meeting. Although the parties are different, free discussion is the most desirable thing. He deeply sympathized with Minister of Commerce and Industry Nakajima's statement on the current situation and parliamentary politics. In order to stabilize people's hearts, it is necessary to stabilize the political situation first. Now, when the whole country must work together, do not hold the idea of opposition to certain forces in the country, and deeply hope to open up the difficult situation with a humble and frank mind in order to promote the prosperity of the national destiny. Machida Chuji then gave a speech saying that although we organize political parties, our hearts are in promoting national interests and people's welfare. Sometimes we have the same opinions and work together, and sometimes we argue with each other, all for the sake of the people. However, the belief that is always the same is to uphold constitutional government and its sound development. He deeply hoped that this meeting would be the foundation for mutual understanding between political parties. Later, although the issue of cooperation between the two parties and policy issues were discussed, no concrete decisions were made. The meeting was adjourned at 9:30 PM.

<h3>Araki's Inappropriate Handling of a Major Incident</h3>
<p>Questioned by Senior Retainers of the Imperial Court</p>
<p>Will Be the Target of Attack in the Diet</p>
<p>(Tokyo) It has recently been rumored in political circles that a major incident (details unknown) occurred in a certain prefecture near Tokyo in November, which caused a conflict between the military police and the prosecutors of the Ministry of Justice. The Minister of the Army's inappropriate handling of the matter has raised serious questions about responsibility in relation to the Imperial Court. Recently, Prime Minister Saito has repeatedly met with Grand Chamberlain Yuasa, and the content is highly confidential. Political circles believe that it is related to this incident. Grand Chamberlain Yuasa and other senior retainers of the Imperial Court, such as Privy Chamberlain Makino, will question Minister of the Army Araki. This atmosphere has also spread to the Privy Council, and it will also be the target of attack by political parties in the Diet. (Hua Lian Dispatch, 26th)</p>

<h3>India's Attitude Changes Again, Japan is Tired of Coping</h3>
<p>Protests Against Revision of Miscellaneous Goods Tariffs</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Japan and India responded to each other with the hope of promoting an agreement on the Indian side and the spirit of coordination on the Japanese side, believing that it might be possible to decide on the outline within the year. However, on the 22nd, the Indian government suddenly announced the revision of export tariffs on miscellaneous goods from Mauritius and other countries, and the atmosphere of negotiation, which had been turning around, took another turn. The Japanese delegation then telegraphed the government to request adjustments and to seek countermeasures against India's insincere attitude. The reason why India's attitude suddenly hardened when the negotiation was about to be established was that it had seen through Japan's weaknesses. However, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is determined to repel it. However, the future of Japan-India negotiations still has many difficulties. (Den Tsushin Dispatch, 26th)</p>

<h3>Volcano Suddenly Erupts at the Southern Tip of the Philippine Islands</h3>
<p>Yellow Smoke Obscures the Sky, Earthquakes Unceasing</p>
<p>Followed by Hurricanes, Rainstorms, and Tsunamis</p>
<p>(Manila) Today, this office received a report from the Iloilo Police Department stating that the Bulusan volcano at the southern tip of Luzon Island suddenly erupted at 9:00 PM on Saturday, spewing out large amounts of sulfur and lava. The lava flowed down from the eroded cracks of the crater, burying the village of Iloilo, burning ten people to death, leaving eleven missing, and leaving more than sixty households homeless. Many livestock also died. The mountain erupted suddenly without any prior warning, spewing yellow smoke, accompanied by unceasing earthquakes, followed by the downward flow of lava, causing many villagers to wake up in shock from their dreams, put on their nightgowns, and flee with their livestock, thus avoiding the disaster. When the alarm reached the city of Sorsogon, twenty miles away, the Red Cross immediately went to provide assistance.

<h3>Northern Route Army Advances to Suppress Communist Bandits in Northern Fujian</h3>
<p>The battles on the Zhejiang-Fujian border have also commenced.</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: At the beginning of the Fujian Incident, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek personally went to Nancheng to supervise the troops, commanding the various units of the Northern Route to attack the pseudo-First Front Army near the Fujian border in eastern Jiangxi in multiple directions, setting a deadline to eliminate the bandits in eastern Jiangxi, so that the bandit suppression army and the troops quelling the Fujian rebellion could establish contact on the Zhejiang-Fujian border. The main force of the pseudo-1st, 3rd, 5th, and 7th armies were completely defeated by our 3rd, 5th, and 8th columns. Most of the Red bandits fled into Jianning, Tai'ning, Yanping, and Shunchang in northern Fujian. Chong'an and Chong'an were also recovered by Xing Zhennan and Zhang Luanji. It will not be difficult to take Shaowu and Shunchang with a single strike. According to front-line news, the Red bandit army was originally divided into pseudo-central and local forces. Currently, in addition to the independent divisions, regiments, battalions, guerrilla guards, and other miscellaneous bandits of the pseudo-military region, provincial, and county soviets, who are still scattered in Yihuang, Nanfeng, Le'an, Lichuan and other adjacent areas, emerging and plundering, Peng Dehuai's pseudo-3rd Army, Lin Biao's pseudo-1st Army Corps, Dong Zhentang's pseudo-5th Army Corps, and Luo Binghui's pseudo-9th Army Corps, around the middle of the month, fled into Fujian from Shan Pass, Sheng Pass, and Kangdu. The pseudo-7th Army Corps, Fang Shao's pseudo-10th, 19th, 20th, and 21st armies, are fleeing along the Jiangxi-Fujian border to the old nests of Yiyang and Hengfeng in Jiangxi and Zhejiang. Zili and Yihuang no longer have large numbers of communist bandits. The counties in eastern Jiangxi are now strictly implementing a blockhouse clearing plan: (1) More than 1,000 ordinary blockhouses have been completed, and more must be built in key locations; (2) Bridgehead blockhouses are being built to defend all highway bridges to prevent the Red bandits from burning them; (3) Highway blockhouses are being built every ten miles on highways that have been opened to traffic. Special commissioners are being dispatched by the war zone headquarters along the Jiangxi-Zhejiang, Jiangxi-Fujian, Jiangxi-Hunan, Jiangxi-Hubei, Jiangxi-Anhui, and Jiangxi-Guangdong lines to supervise and inspect; (4) Blockhouse clusters, such as in Qianchuan and Qingjiang counties, are designating key locations to build countless blockhouses, linked together into a group. All key blockhouses have been mostly completed, and the militia organization starts from both sides of the highway. The completed blockhouses are handed over to the militia to defend. When necessary, supplies are concentrated in the blockhouses, and a firm policy of fortified villages and cleared fields allows the people to have a firm and long-term anti-bandit force, and the army can be transferred forward.</p>
<p>Conflicts have broken out between the Fujian and Zhejiang armies, and a major war is about to begin. The Fujian army is concentrated in the west of Shouning and Zhenghe, and the bandit army is gathered in the west of Yanping and Shunchang, preparing to risk everything to attack. Therefore, the Northern Route Army in eastern Jiangxi, in addition to the defense troops responsible for guarding the command headquarters, are advancing towards northern Fujian overnight, increasing the troop strength in certain locations and forming mutual support with Pucheng, Xianxia, and the Zhejiang border. □□□□□□□□ large armies are gathered. The morale of the front-line soldiers is extremely high. If the bandits and Fujian army leave the Zhejiang border, the troops on the Zhejiang-Fujian border can give them a head-on blow, and the various divisions of the Northern Route Army in northern Fujian can go straight to Yanping to cut off the retreat of the Fujian army that is attacking the east. The so-called "People's Government" is bound to disintegrate. (December 24th)</p>
<h3>Communist Bandits in Southern Hubei Invade Chongyang</h3>
<p>Chen Jicheng Arrives in Puchi to Command</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: The remnants of the bandits on the Jiangxi border have recently been fleeing to southern Hubei one after another. They initially attacked Tongshan, but were defeated and retreated. Now they are harassing Dayuan, Guxiangling, Qingshanpu, Caijiadun in the southern district of Chongyang, and Shichengwan, Xueguanfan, Tuodoushan in the western district, carrying out arson and murder, and attempting to attack Chongcheng. According to people from Puchi, the National Army is concentrating to suppress them, and three units, including a certain unit, have reportedly been transferred to reinforce them. Chen Jicheng of the Western Route Army, and Division Commander Feng Xingxian, arrived in Puchi from Hankou on the 24th to deploy military forces. Chen is stationed on the armored military command and when the bandit situation was at its peak, people were extremely frightened. When Chen arrived in Puchi, the military prestige was greatly enhanced, and people's hearts were stabilized. The bandits, knowing that a large army was gathered, gradually fled towards the border of Xianning, and Chen immediately ordered a search and suppression, to eliminate them in one fell swoop.

<h3>Shandong Province's Native Products Oversupply</h3>
<p>Cotton, Peanuts, and Wheat Piled Up</p>
<p>Total Value Reaches 10 Million Yuan</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Shandong Province is rich in local products, surpassing Hebei and Henan. Cotton production is mainly concentrated in Linqing, Xiazhen, and Gaotang. This year's total harvest is 800,000 bales. Cotton from Nangong and Wuqiao in southern Hebei is also coming to Jinan for sale. Peanuts are abundant in the Tai'an area of southern Shandong, and goods from Linpu, Qidong, and Lijin also converge in Jinan. Wheat is produced everywhere, with Xuzhou and Yanzhou in the south, and Pingyuan and Yuancheng in the north being the most abundant areas. In addition, there are black dates in western Shandong and tobacco along the Jiaoji Railway in eastern Shandong, which are sold to several provinces in the north and south. This year's black dates had a poor harvest, and although the tobacco harvest was good, the tobacco company refused to buy it, and the value plummeted, only half of what it was in previous years. However, its trading center is not in Jinan. In previous years, when local products were put on the market, the trading was at its peak, and merchants from all over gathered in Jinan to set up shops and buy them, with sales reaching far and wide, thus activating the rural economy and making Jinan exceptionally prosperous. However, after the May 3rd Incident, Jinan became a dead city. In recent years, it has been affected by the global economic recession, local product exports have been cut off, and the market has been depressed. This year's cotton, peanuts, and wheat harvests have been very abundant, but sales are blocked and piled up in Jinan, estimated to be worth about 10 million yuan. Local product merchants are losing money and complaining endlessly, and farmers are also earning little from a year of hard work due to the falling prices of goods. The collapse of the rural economy has created a serious phenomenon. Now that the year is coming to an end, there is probably not much trading to be done. The situation of the accumulation of various local products is described as follows:</p>
<p>(Cotton) Since the new cotton came on the market in September this year, it has been transported to Jinan. Although the Shanghai merchants have been buying, they have not been very keen due to the arrival of American cotton. After the Japanese merchants boycotted Indian cotton, they purchased Shandong cotton, but they did not import much. State-owned yarn factories, such as Qingdao Huaxin, Jinan Lufeng, and Chengtong, etc., are not very enthusiastic about purchasing due to poor yarn sales. The price, which was previously 44 or 45 yuan, is now 38 or 39 yuan, and every day 1,000 to 2,000 bales of spot goods are traded and futures are shipped out, while at the same time 1,000 to 2,000 bales are also imported every day. After offsetting the two figures, the total cotton stock in the city is now 125,000 bales, with an average price of 60 yuan per bale, worth about 7.5 million yuan.</p>
<p>(Peanuts) The peanut sales channel has become very narrow. Qingdao merchants and Japanese merchants are not buying in large quantities, and only Guangdong merchants are purchasing, but the amount is also small. When it first came on the market, it was 5.45 yuan, but now it is only 4.12 yuan. Since the Fujian issue, the Guangdong merchants have also purchased rarely. In the past half month, local merchants have purchased and stored peanuts because the price of peanuts has fallen to the lowest limit, and there have been slight transactions every day, but they are not actual sales. Only a few hundred tons are traded every day. The total storage of peanuts in the city is more than 130,000 bales, with each bale calculated at more than 7 yuan, worth about 1 million yuan.</p>
<p>(Wheat) The Jinan Grain Industry Association is the general mechanism for grain transactions. At its peak, there were more than 100 companies involved in transactions, but now there are only more than 30. Transactions are mainly wheat. This year, the flour mills are not operating well and are losing money, so they are shrinking their scope to maintain support. The output has decreased and the purchase of wheat is also rare. In the past week, due to the New Year's relationship, the factories have not purchased. Good wheat in Jiehe and other places is now only more than 3.30 yuan. The total storage in the city is 160,000 bales, worth about 1.3 million yuan.</p>
<p>As for Shandong's cattle hides, they have always been a major export product. The Cattle Hide Bureau's income was more than 910,000 yuan in the 19th year of the Republic, 900,000 yuan in the 20th year, and 580,000 yuan in the 21st year. As of August this year, it has only received 280,000 yuan, and the current income is almost zero. The decline of export goods is so great that it is no wonder the rural areas are so desolate.

<h3>Rural Revival Committee Investigates Tea Industry in Huizhou</h3>
<p>Fu Hongzhen is dispatched to Huizhou</p>
<p>To discuss ways to save the tea industry</p>
<p>Wuyuan Correspondence: The Rural Revival Committee of the Executive Yuan believes that the decline of Chinese tea has reached its extreme, and methods should be found to save it to recover this dwindling source of profit. It has specially appointed Fu Hongzhen as a specialist investigator of the tea industry in Anhui Province. Mr. Fu arrived in Tunxi a few days ago and visited the leaders of the tea industry in the town to discuss future relief methods and solicit opinions. He also entrusted the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau to publicize that the bureau has been ordered by the Ministry of Industry to strictly ban the coloring of Chinese tea, and distributed the bureau's non-toxic improved colorants to various tea shops for application, in order to enhance international credibility and avoid being criticized and excluded by foreigners. Wang Qiupu, chairman of the town's Tea Industry Association, convened a meeting of all tea merchants to welcome him, and fully contributed the crux and weaknesses of the decline of the tea industry, and jointly sought a way out. During the meeting, Fu sharply pointed out the gains and losses of the tea industry, and published the reasons for the plunder of Chinese tea sales as follows: "I have been ordered to investigate and publicize the original intention of banning colored tea, and to persuade the use of alternative non-toxic improved colorants. Southern Anhui is a concentration point for green tea in Anhui, Zhejiang, and Jiangxi. Recently, Chinese tea has been plundered in the overseas market by Indian, Ceylon, Javanese, Japanese, and Taiwanese tea, and the Chinese tea market is on the verge of danger due to the global economic downturn. In the most prosperous year, the output value of tea in Tunxi was 5 or 6 million silver dollars, and the Chouxin Zhenmei tea was as high as more than 300 taels. In the past two years, the Tunxi tea market has been unusually sluggish. Last year, the French government promulgated Article 3 of the regulations for the entry of Chinese tea into French territories, which stipulates that green tea mixed with various teas and colored with indigo, turmeric, talc, or gypsum is prohibited from being sold. Indigo is commonly used by merchants, so there is no problem with blue color. The use of turmeric is slightly astringent, which is actually not without obstruction. The most important thing to prohibit is the yellow aluminum acid and the green arsenic, which contain toxic substances. Tea is originally a beneficial health drink, and its production should be clean, so that it can cater to the needs of consumers. However, Chinese tea is adulterated and faked, and improper colorants such as indigo, foreign blue, turmeric, and lead are added in order to make it look beautiful, or even gypsum, salt, and iron filings are used to increase the weight. Thirty years ago, Australia discovered that Chinese tea was mixed with tree roots, leaves, or old tea mixed with viscous substances, and the inferior appearance was revealed after brewing, reputation was reduced, and capital suffered losses. This kind of immoral behavior damages the credibility of foreign trade, and is enough to give India and Ceylon useful publicity. Decades ago, the world tea market was exclusively occupied by Chinese tea and ranked first in the country's export trade. Now it has been reduced to sixth place, below hides and eggs. The quantity of exports has been reduced by one-half in the past 60 years, while the world's need for tea has increased from 300 million pounds to more than 900 million pounds. In recent decades, Indian, Japanese, and Ceylon tea production has been surplus, and a dumping policy has been implemented, so if we want to revive Chinese tea, we must improve the colorants in order to improve the quality." It is heard that after Mr. Fu completes his investigation in Tunxi, he will go to other counties under Huizhou, as well as Ningguo, Taiping, Guangde, and Xuancheng, and Chun'an and Changhua in Zhejiang Province, for investigation.

<h3>Overview of the Current Situation in Guangxi Province</h3>
<p>Guangxi Province has achieved remarkable results since being governed by Li Zongren and Bai Chongxi after the 18th year of the Republic. An overview of its situation is as follows:</p>
<p>Vast Land and Sparse Population: Guangxi Province borders French Annam to the southwest and is actually a southern shield for our country. The area is 218,923 square kilometers, mostly mountainous. According to the survey in the 20th year of the Republic, the population is 10,560,500, with an average of 49 people per square kilometer. Compared with Jiangsu Province, which has an area of 105,605 square kilometers and a population of 34,125,857, with an average of 323 people per square kilometer, there is a difference of more than six times. Therefore, the land is vast and the population is sparse. The lack of cultivation of mountain land, allowing it to be barren, is common from Wuzhou to Nanning.</p>
<p>Simple Folk Customs: Guangxi Province has many Yao and Zhuang people. During the Song Dynasty, Nong Zhigao of the Li people occupied Yongning and ruled the entire Guangxi. It was quelled by General Di Qing leading his army. The Kunlun Pass, recorded in history, is located at the intersection of Yongning and Binyang. Most of Di's army was from Shandong, and their descendants have flourished. The people of Guangxi mostly wear cloth clothes and eat coarse grains, and are brave and strong. Women are quite capable and operate no differently than men.</p>
<p>Local Tranquility: The late Qing Dynasty folk saying goes, "In Guangxi Province, there is no land without mountains, no mountains without caves, no caves without bandits." For border officials, transferring to Guangxi was a daunting task. Since the 18th year of the Republic, bandits have been gradually cleared, and the wounds of the Guangdong-Guangxi war have gradually recovered over the years. The province's income is about 30 million yuan per year, which is less than half of Guangdong's, and its distribution is three-fifths for government expenses and two-fifths for military expenses. Education expenses account for 75% of government expenses. The annual government expenditure in Guixian County is 120,000 yuan, and the education expenditure is 90,000 yuan. There are currently about 20 regiments of troops, and local security is mostly maintained by the militia. Soldiers' monthly salaries are 12 yuan, paid on time every month, with no arrears, so military discipline is very good.</p>
<p>Organizing the Militia: The Guangxi Military and Political Conference in the 20th year of the Republic resolved to</p>
<p>Adopt the eight-character policy of "Resisting Japan, Suppressing Communists, Being Friendly, and Being Good Neighbors." In recent years, it has been engaged in political training, cultivating the people's armed forces, implementing autonomy, developing education, and developing the economy at the same time. The results of organizing and training the militia are quite remarkable. The method is to conscript men aged 25 to 40 as regular militia soldiers, train them for six months, and then discharge them. Each time half of the militia soldiers are discharged, the training period is six months, and conscription is held every three months. When the current term is about to expire, the next term will be conscripted to continue training. During the period of enlistment, the monthly salary is paid jointly by the government and local governments, with the proportion being half each. The province is divided into seven districts: Nanning, Guilin, Baise, Tianbao, Wuzhou, Longzhou, and each district has a command headquarters with a commander. Each county has a command headquarters with a commander, who is currently concurrently held by the county magistrate, and a deputy commander is appointed by someone who is familiar with military affairs. Below the county level, there are three types of joint teams, brigades, and squads in districts, townships, and villages, which are under the command of the highest military organ stationed in the province and supervised and guided by the provincial government. Militia soldiers are classified into: (1) Regular Force: selected and trained from the reserve militia soldiers in various counties in the district; (2) Reserve Force: assigned after the training period of the regular militia soldiers; (3) Reserve Force: composed of all conscriptable men in various counties, and when needed, a cadre training team is established, which is composed of retired military officers, sergeants, and graduates of higher primary schools or students with equivalent education selected from various counties in the district. As for the weapons needed by the regular force, in addition to issuing them, the number lacking is temporarily borrowed from the people by the county militia command headquarters. Flags are erected and forts are built in important locations, and one or two militiamen are stationed to protect local travel. The suppression of bandits in Guangxi Province has been successful, and it is indeed due to the effective work of the army in suppressing them, but it also depends entirely on the assistance of the militia.</p>
<p>Engaging in Political Training: Guangxi Province promotes autonomy, militia, education, and economy in one piece. Autonomy is not separated from official duties. Below the province and county levels, there are districts, townships (towns), villages (streets, homes). The district chief, township chief, and village chief also concurrently serve as the joint team leader, brigade leader, and squad leader of the militia. The district, township, and village offices are the militia team headquarters. The future plan is to set up a school in each district, township, and village. The principal also concurrently serves as the village chief and militia team leader. The school is the team headquarters and village office. Farmers' banks and cooperatives in various townships and villages are located in the school, and the head of the school is in charge of economic construction. The most capable and honorable person in the local area is the principal.</p>
<p>Party Headquarters in Secret: The Guangxi Provincial Party Headquarters has temporarily stopped recruiting new party members, and the county party headquarters and below are implementing secret work. Each county only has a communications office, with a secretary to handle external affairs. The names of the members of the Party Central Committee are not publicly announced. The government handles affairs according to the decisions of the Party Headquarters. The chairman and members of the provincial government and the county magistrates also serve as members of the Party Headquarters to avoid separation. There is now no more conflict between the party and the government.</p>
<p>Developed Highways: Guangxi Province's highways are very developed. In addition to the provincial roads that run through the entire province, each county also has county roads, which are all passable by cars. For example, from Wuzhou to Nanning is 1,110 li, and the entire journey is in the mountains and ridges. The road surface is very wide, and the road base is very solid. Although it is winding and continuous, the car travels very smoothly. Vehicles passing through are charged a road maintenance fee of 20%. Also, from Rongxian to Nanning, the one-way fare is 150 yuan. The road maintenance project is supervised by the county government of the location through which it passes, and the villagers provide funds and labor.</p>
<p>Abundant Products: When imported goods enter the country, the Guangxi Provincial Government appropriately increases taxes to protect domestic products and strives for self-sufficiency. As for future economic construction, it has decided to first organize water conservancy, dredge ditches, to facilitate transportation, encourage industry, promote textiles, sugar making, papermaking, planting ramie, and mining, and then study cotton planting and improve the method of making tung oil. According to investigations, the situation of Guangxi's products is as follows: (1) Cultivated Land: In the 6th and 7th years of the Republic, the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce reported that there were more than 80 million mu. The estimate of the Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics of the National Government and reports from various parties show that the total area of paddy fields in the province is about 28 million mu, so there should be more than 50 million mu of reclaimed land and forest land. Rice is the most important crop, with a total output of 45 million dan in the province, with yields ranging from more than 160 jin to more than 340 jin per mu. Next are wheat, corn, sorghum, millet, sweet potatoes, peanuts, soybeans, sugarcane, tea, cotton, ramie, indigo, etc. The output of soybeans and sugarcane is very large. (2) Fishery and Animal Husbandry: Bees, producing cattle, horses, pigs, sheep, chickens, ducks, geese, and pigeons. There are many goats. Horses are purely small species, and their efficiency is far inferior to those produced in Mongolia and Gansu, but they are more agile and also commendable. The annual silk production is 161,695 jin, worth 696,056 yuan. Many counties raise bees, but they do not know how to use new methods. (3) Forestry: Publicly operated are the Liujiang Forest Reclamation Area Office's Liucheng, Liuzhou, Yishan, and Guerong Forest Farms, Fangqiao, Chalu, and Xixiang Forest Farms in the Nanning area, and the Junshan Tung Farm, the Guilin Forest Farm in the Guilin area, the Baise Forest Farm in the Tiannan area, the Longzhou Forest Farm in the Southern area, and the privately operated ones are the most prosperous in the Liujiang area. From the 16th year of the Republic to June of the 21st year, a total of more than 237,000 mu of wasteland was distributed. Timber is the main forest product, with an annual production of 100,000 dan of tung oil, but unfortunately the quality is not pure, and foreign trade is not prosperous. Tea oil is 200,000 dan, cassia oil is 1,000 dan, and anise oil is 2,000 dan, with a total value of 7.35 million. (4) Minerals: Guangxi Province is rich in minerals, with tin and manganese being the most famous. There are provincial-run tin mines in Fuchuan, Hexian, Zhongshan, Nandan, and Hechi, covering an area of 72,360 mu. The remaining minerals such as gold, silver, copper, iron, lead, zinc, bismuth, tungsten, barium, antimony, arsenic, mercury, gypsum, asbestos, saltpeter, and sulfur have a total annual output of 3,404,704 yuan. The sales channels for manganese and antimony have always been Japan. After the September 18th Incident, they have all been suspended. If capital can be invested and new methods are used, fully exploiting them would truly be a great natural source of wealth. However, Guangxi Province is known for being poor and lacking capital. Most commercial operations have small capital and use indigenous mining methods, resulting in very low output, which makes it a pity to abandon the goods on the ground. The coal reserves are estimated to be 300 million tons, and iron is 23.125 million tons. (5) Industry: Guangxi's industry is still immature. Publicly operated factories include the provincial-run sulfuric acid factory, the Guangxi Machinery Factory, the Guangxi Alcohol Factory, the Nanning Leather Factory, the Guangxi Printing Bureau, and six people's factories in Fuchuan, Hezhou, and Zhongshan counties. Privately operated factories are all small capital. Handicrafts such as cotton weaving, porcelain, leather, paper, cigarette cutting, brewing, flour, and firecrackers have a total annual production value of 14,552,808 yuan. (6) Commerce: Statistics from Wuzhou, Nanning, and Longzhou show that imports exceeded exports by 12,230,669 yuan.</p>
<h3>Yongding Militia Infighting After the Fujian Incident</h3>
<p>Mediation Attempts by Various Parties Fail Repeatedly</p>
<p>Fujian Authorities Have No Time to Attend to Both Military Suppression and Pacification</p>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: In Yongding, Southern Fujian, clashes erupted between Li Yuying's militia and the militia led by Yongding County Magistrate Hu Daonan in the early part of this month in Zhongkeng over the collection of general merchandise taxes (i.e., transit taxes). Hu Daonan was defeated and retreated to the mountain top. Zhongkeng, being Hu's hometown, suffered unexpected losses, with Hu's buildings being burned down. According to Yongding natives in Shantou, the truth of the matter is roughly as follows: Jinfengjiao Pit in Yongding County is a vital land route for cargo transportation between Fujian and Guangdong. The militia has established various tax bureaus there, collecting a large amount of revenue from merchandise taxes. Previously, the Yongding County Public Office sent personnel to collect these taxes. However, after the sudden change in the situation in western Fujian some time ago, Wang Mingchen, the tax collector, absconded with the funds. As a result, Li Yuying, the head of the Zhongkeng Jinfeng District and Hulei Jiaokeng militias, appointed Li Guisan as the tax collector, responsible for collecting all taxes and levies in that area. Ostensibly, it was said that all tax revenue would be distributed fairly to support all the Jinfeng militia, but neither the upper nor lower Jinfeng militia received any benefit. Local people generally did not interfere, as the public taxes were supposed to be managed publicly. When Guangdong Army Commander Huang Renbin took over the defense of Yongding, the Yongding militia, in order to unite internally and cooperate effectively, held a joint meeting in Xiayang on October 22nd. They decided to establish a county-wide defense force training center, appointing Hu Daonan as the director. The tax revenue from Jiaokeng was to be handed over to the training center for management. Ye Weihai's regiment of Commander Huang's army stationed in Yongding, in cooperation with Hu Daonan, recruited the old Xinan District militia under Zheng Yaochuan and reorganized it into an anti-communist corps, appointing Zheng as the captain. In mid-November, Commander Huang's army was transferred away from Yongding. Zheng, under Ye's orders, was transferred to Jinfeng to await orders. On the 21st of that month, they arrived at Xibian and, due to insufficient supplies, borrowed 30 silver dollars from the Jiaokeng tax collection office. The tax collector, Li Guisan, refused, as the Jiaokeng tax collection office had not handed over management to the training center as per the resolution. Li Guisan and Zheng had a heated argument. Zheng, acting on Hu Daonan's orders, disarmed the militia guarding the tax revenue in Jiaokeng, confiscating six rifles and two pistols, and detaining three tax collectors. Two other tax officials carrying pistols were also disarmed of two pistols by the Zhongkeng militia while they were out. This occurred on the 22nd. Upon hearing of this, Li Yuying was furious. On the 23rd, he led a joint defense force of 70 or 80 men from his and neighboring villages and marched to Xiayang, on the border of Dapu County in Guangdong, and surrounded the headquarters of the Xiayang volunteer corps. The Xiayang volunteer corps retreated to the Zhongkeng volunteer corps headquarters on the mountain top, having been informed in advance by telephone from Xiayang and prepared defenses on the mountain. When Li Yuying arrived at the Xiayang Bridge, both sides immediately opened fire across the stream. Zheng Yaochuan's unit, still in Jiaokeng, heard the gunfire and advanced towards Liyiwuo, sending a squad to attack. Li's forces retreated slightly. Although the original Zhongkeng militia was under Hu Daonan's command, it was divided into three factions at the time, and they shirked responsibility during the battle. Zheng's unit advanced fiercely, while the Zhongkeng militia retreated. The battle ceased at dusk, with Zheng's unit losing a squad leader named Zhang Decai. Both sides suffered casualties. That night, local gentry Chen Yuanhou, Cao Zhifang, Zhang Youtun, and over ten others stepped forward to mediate and reached a resolution: (1) The joint defense force would retrieve the three tax collectors, including Li Guisan, from Jiaokeng. At the same time, the Xiayang market town would be designated as a buffer zone, and both sides would withdraw their troops from Xiayang. (2) The mediators would be responsible for returning the confiscated firearms in Jiaokeng, and the joint defense force would retreat to Hukeng. (3) Both sides would send representatives and impartial individuals to mediate and resolve the matter within a set time frame to prevent the situation from escalating. (4) The tax revenue from Jiaokeng would be handed over to a financial committee composed of local people for public collection and distribution, with neither side interfering. That night, the mediators worked tirelessly throughout the night. At 8:00 AM on the 24th, representatives from all sides gathered at the Xiayang market town. Li Guisan and others were handed over to Su Jingwu, who signed a receipt. After Li was released, Li Yuying's joint defense force did not honor the agreement. They only withdrew the sentries from the Hu clan's ancestral hall and refused to leave Xiayang. They also demanded the return of the confiscated pistols and rifles from the non-confiscated tax officials, refusing to leave. The mediators then withdrew. People in Zhongkeng mostly blamed Hu Daonan for being inexperienced, causing harm to their hometown. Some complained to Li Yuying, revealing Hu's shortcomings. Li was well aware of the complex internal situation of Zhongkeng and that Hu Daonan could not control or command the various militias. On one hand, he sent people to Fuxi to invite Huang Chaigou to lead the Fuxi militia to join the fighting, and also requested troops from the Third Regiment of Nan'an to come to Xiayang to bolster their strength. On the other hand, he declared to the Zhongkeng representatives that Li was only targeting Hu Daonan, and the grievances had specific targets, having nothing to do with the Zhongkeng people and would not cause any trouble. Except for the showdown with Zheng Yaochuan, all other armed militias were considered brothers. Huang Chaigou's unit from Fuxi indeed arrived on the 24th, with extremely untidy uniforms and a mix of old and new weapons. Those carrying bamboo baskets followed behind, in a grand and overwhelming manner, attacking Zhongkeng with all their might. The Zhongkeng militia could not hold out and retreated to Jiaokeng Xibian. Li Yuying attacked Zhongkeng at noon, burning down Hu Daonan's entire building. The entire village was looted, and those carrying bamboo baskets left with full loads. Twelve young women were also kidnapped. Li's forces retreated to Xiayang in the afternoon and detained the kidnapped women in the Zhonghe Building in Taipingzhai. There were reports of gang rape. Yongding natives residing in Dapu County were extremely indignant upon hearing the news and sent Zhang Minquan, Lu Zuoping, and ten others to mediate. They arrived in Xiayang on the 29th and negotiated with Li Yuying to release the twelve women who had been raped and were suffering from illness. They were placed in Zeng Baichuan's house for medical treatment. After the representatives from Dapu arrived, they invited local gentry Liao Haitao, Chen Yuanhou, and Cao Zhifang to mediate again. Zhongkeng paid 600 yuan as compensation for the two confiscated pistols, as a condition for the release of the twelve women. Li demanded an additional 100 yuan to cover losses. While negotiations were underway, Li's forces attacked Zheng Yaochuan in Jiaokeng again, and the second mediation was interrupted. The Zhongkeng faction, having been looted, had united, and both sides fought desperately. The number of casualties is unknown. As of December 2nd.</p>
<h3>Inspection Tour of Jiangxi, Anhui, Hunan, and Hubei (Special Correspondent Ren An)</h3>
<p>Local Ruffians in Konglong Bully Others and Illegally Collect Boat Taxes</p>
<p>Huangmei Called "Little Tianzhu," People Suffer Great Hardship</p>
<p>Huangmei Correspondence: After returning from Jingfu to Huangchuan, I originally intended to go directly to Lu'an in Anhui via Gushi, or to Lihuang, the newly established county seat in western Anhui, via Shangcheng. However, the roads were difficult to travel. Therefore, I took the original route, returned to Wuhan, and took a riverboat to Xiaochikou, across from Jiujiang, then transferred to a boat to Huangmei and then to western Anhui.</p>
<p>Forty miles north of Xiaochikou lies Konglong. Although it is a small town, it is a transportation hub connecting neighboring areas. People from all walks of life gather here, and personnel disputes occur from time to time. Over the years, no fewer than two or three hundred ships have passed through the town's pier. A group of local ruffians secretly formed a gang, forcibly collecting pier taxes, not for local public expenses, but for the gang's private distribution, with thirty-one shares in total. Those with greater influence, or those who bravely stepped forward due to disputes, could receive two or three shares, or half a share. The members were extremely complex, including fierce old men, widows, young children, and failed scholars, lacking uniformity. The amount of tax collected was also extremely heavy. Regardless of the type of ship, 60% of the business income was taken. The boatmen's hard-earned money was exhausted, leaving them with only 40%. If they concealed any income, the ships that provided their family's livelihood would be in danger of being destroyed. It is truly shocking. In 1928, Huangmei County Magistrate Li Jinfang once banned this practice, but the town's thieving became rampant for a time, especially pickpocketing at the pier. In 1930, the gang resurfaced and established a shipping union, continuing to collect pier taxes, reducing the rate from 60% to 40%. Moreover, the shareholders built eighteen ships to control the shipping industry, giving them priority for all cargo and passenger transport. In recent years, due to droughts, many farmers abandoned farming and engaged in the shipping industry, leading to a sudden increase in sailing ships, reaching more than two hundred. However, due to the loss of business, those who requested to join the union were rejected, leading to growing resentment. A month ago, a wine merchant transported several jars of wine on a civilian ship to Huangmei. The union, claiming a loss of their priority rights, insisted on transferring the wine to their own ship, leading to a dispute and a brawl, severely injuring the ship owner and smashing the wine jars. The merchant filed a complaint with the county government. The county magistrate, considering that the union had too few ships to meet the legal requirements for a union, intended to dissolve it. However, fearing their power, he instead ordered District Chief Wang Kenian to mediate. The union paid five silver dollars to settle the matter. However, the issue of protecting the business of the two hundred civilian ships and banning the heavy taxes was never mentioned. It is rumored that the union secretly sends ten yuan a month from the tax revenue to the Chamber of Commerce, and District Chief Wang, who also serves as the Chamber of Commerce president, is suspected of favoring and helping the evildoers. Now, the two hundred civilian boat owners, unable to withstand the exploitation and the pressure of life, are filled with anger and are about to engage in a life-and-death struggle with the union. The union, with its many unsavory characters, is also eager to fight. It is widely believed that a major disaster is brewing. Once it erupts, it will have a significant negative impact on social order. A spark can ignite a prairie fire, and the interests of the working masses should not be exploited for long. The principle is very clear, and those who govern the people should not ignore it. The county seat is sixty miles from Konglong. The market is still good. Many small peasant landowners live in the countryside, eating coarse food and wearing rough clothes year-round, living a very hard life. In particular, the price of oil and salt is extremely high (salt is 960 cash per catty, equivalent to 6,500 cash in silver), and many people cannot afford to eat it for months. The price of land rose to two or three hundred yuan per dou (unit of measurement) of land between 1926 and 1926, but has now fallen to below one hundred yuan. Wages have also fallen along with the land price. Li Ziying, with the help of various parties, has occupied Pingzhai on the western side of Jiaokeng, and is currently stationed in the Zou surname's enclosed building. Li treats the areas he occupies as conquered territory, and the people are greatly ravaged, with rape and robbery being commonplace. Zheng Yaochuan's forces were defeated and retreated to Yanxia, below Yamatam. Four days later, both sides made contact and the conflict turned into a large-scale clan feud. Li Ziying beheaded a squad leader and a soldier from Zheng's unit and displayed their heads to the public. Li's ferocity is increasing. The Luxi militia in Nan'an County has also recently clashed with Li's forces, due to Luxi cattle dealers leading cattle through Nanxi, which were robbed by Li's forces. Many women from Nanxi who went to Luxi to buy rice were robbed. Both sides gathered crowds across the river for a major battle. The Fujian authorities have no time to attend to both military suppression and pacification, and the Guangdong army cannot easily intervene. It is unknown how this matter will be resolved. (15th)</p>
<p>The price of land fluctuates from time to time. People still value the town and do not easily sell their property. In recent years, due to continuous famines, income is insufficient, and the trend of selling land is gradually increasing. This can be seen in the sales contracts. Moreover, there is a superstitious system of dividing property, and some people only sell property after a son dies. For example, if there are six dou of land and three sons, and one son dies, they must sell the two dou that the deceased son should have received to pay for funeral expenses. There is no deposit for renting land, but the annual rent must be paid in advance in the previous year. If the rent is not paid in the previous year or is overdue, interest will be charged at 30% per annum on the outstanding rent.</p>
<p>The county is divided into four districts, each with nine towns. The joint defense funds for each district are added to the land tax. There are six security teams, which require annual expenses of 110,000 to 120,000 yuan. It is said that many district chiefs are corrupt. There are very few bandits being caught, and the people cannot bear the burden. They have repeatedly requested a reduction in the teams, but their requests have not been approved. The people are resentful. There are more than ten miscellaneous taxes, with the bandit suppression levy being the heaviest. The people are required to pay 40 yuan per person to hire laborers, which has now risen to 100 yuan, and there are no people willing to be hired. Beggars are prevalent in the four rural areas, and beggars are not ashamed. There are three reasons for this: (1) The area is the birthplace of the Fourth Patriarch Daoxin, the Fifth Patriarch Hongren, and the Sixth Patriarch Huineng, and is known as "Little Tianzhu." The so-called Buddhist sites of the Fourth Patriarch Mountain, Fifth Patriarch Mountain, and the Eastern Zen Temple, where the Sixth Patriarch practiced, as well as the Fifth Patriarch Temple seen on the way to Susong, are serene and solemn with various ancestral relics. Tens of thousands of devout men and women from various provinces travel thousands of miles to worship Buddha every year. The villagers used to receive alms and became accustomed to it. After 1930, the incense at the temples declined sharply, and no one gave alms, feeling like they had lost their jobs. (2) The terrain is low and humid, with many lakes and rivers. The rivers are easily flooded and silted up, leading to frequent disasters and no means of survival. (3) Gambling is rampant, with organizations called "Brotherhood Societies" engaging in gambling every day. If it is in the city or town, they are still cautious and set up secret gambling dens. In the countryside, they openly entice villagers to gamble all day and night, resulting in the gamblers losing their fortunes and livelihoods. Families of several people are forced to become beggars. In addition, there is a type of begging where poor farmers leave only one or two family members to guard the house after the harvest, and the rest go begging in other places, some even going directly to Wuhan and returning after several months. Some say it is a custom, but it is actually due to insufficient food, forcing them to do so.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Province Decides to Change Administrative Regions</h3>
<p>Five Commissioners to be Established in Jiangbei</p>
<p>All Districts in Jiangnan to be Abolished</p>
<p>Zhenjiang Correspondence: The Jiangsu provincial authorities have recently decided to increase the powers of the administrative commissioners, who will no longer concurrently hold the position of county magistrate. All districts in Jiangnan will be abolished. In Jiangbei, including Yangzhong and Chongming in the center of the Yangtze River, five districts will be established. It is reported that the counties under the jurisdiction of the five districts are as follows: District 1: Jiangdu, Yizheng, Liuhe, Jiangpu, Yangzhong, Gaoyou, Baoying, Taixian; District 2: Nantong, Rugao, Jingjiang, Haimen, Taixing, Dongtai, Qidong, Chongming; District 3: Huai'an, Huaiyin, Siyang, Lianshui, Funing, Yancheng, Xinghua; District 4: Tongshan, Fengxian, Peixian, Xiaoxian, Dangshan, Pizhou; District 5: Donghai, Suqian, Suining, Guanyun, Shuyang, Ganyu. The above are a total of thirty-five counties, and the distribution of their districts is roughly as such. There may be temporary changes. As for the reason for abolishing the Jiangnan commissioners, it is believed that Jiangnan has convenient transportation and is more peaceful than Jiangbei, and its area is not as large as Jiangbei. Therefore, it is not necessary to establish commissioners to promote autonomy in Jiangnan. It is also understood that Jiangbei is taking self-defense measures, and the abolition of district chiefs and the implementation of the baojia system may be implemented together. As for the selection of commissioners, it is said that those with military knowledge and political acumen are qualified and are currently being reviewed.</p>

<h3>Four Bandits Arrested in a Small Inn</h3>
<p>On the night of the 23rd, the Huangdu Jiajie Sixth District Security Corps arrested four people from Taizhou, Xu A'er, Zhao Baotai, Huang A'er, and Gu A'er, at the Gaosheng Inn in this town. They were immediately taken back to the Corps headquarters. According to their confessions, they had robbed the boss Shen Fu'an three times near Huangdu last month, shared the stolen money, and hid in Shanghai. They had more than twenty accomplices and a pistol and a Mauser pistol. They said that they were avoiding the limelight, Shen told us to temporarily hide at a friend's place who is a cobbler in Huangdu, and someone would come to lead us tomorrow morning, so we stayed at the inn and were arrested. Today, the victims, Mao Zhengshan and others from Xiwancun in this county, identified that Xu and others had robbed their house. Chief Jin immediately prepared a document and escorted them to the county government for legal action.</p>

<h3>Prosecution in the Case of Pushing Someone into the Sea</h3>
<p>Due to the purchase of fish caught by fishermen, Jiang Zhengxing Fish Shop in Jinshanwei was undercut by Jiang Zhengji Fish Shop owner Jiang Xiaomei, leading to a dispute. Jiang Xiaomei lured Jiang Zhouwang and his brother, the owners of Jiang Zhengxing Fish Shop, and violently pushed them into the sea out of spite. Jiang Zhouwang and his brothers drank seawater until their voices were hoarse. Their appetite has decreased significantly recently, indicating internal injuries. They are truly unwilling to accept this, so Jiang Zhouwang and his brothers filed a lawsuit in the Songjiang County Court Prosecutor's Office against Jiang Xiaomei for attempted murder to uphold justice.</p>
<h3>Verdict in the Lawsuit over the Site of the Provincial Experimental Elementary School</h3>
<p>The site of the Provincial Experimental Elementary School next to the Songwei Road was involved in a lawsuit with the local resident Zhang Jiecai over land rights. The case was initially judged by the county court, and Zhang Jiecai appealed. The higher court sent the case back to the county for retrial. The county court has now issued a judgment stating that in the lawsuit between Zhang Jiecai and Shen Shoujin over the land, Shen Shoujin shall return to Zhang Jiecai seven fen and nine li of Huangzi Weiji Tian in Fangyi Tu. The litigation costs shall be borne by Shen Shoujin.</p>

<h3>Abuses Arise from Lifting the Ban on Cattle Slaughter</h3>
<p>The Wuxian Business Tax Collection Bureau, under orders to collect cattle slaughter taxes, opened slaughtering yesterday (the 26th). All ten cattle slaughter licenses have been obtained by cattle merchants Ma Changrong and others from the Bureau. Another group of cattle merchants, Cheng Shutang and five others, argued that the Bureau's issuance of licenses was not announced in advance and was completely done in private, so that genuine cattle merchants did not receive licenses. They pointed out that five of the ten people who received licenses were not cattle merchants and were manipulating the slaughtering to profit from it, causing genuine cattle merchants to be forced to close down and their livelihoods to be disrupted. They submitted a petition yesterday (the 26th) to the Business Tax Bureau and the Suzhou Finance Department, requesting assistance.</p>

<h3>Septuagenarian Dies in Fire</h3>
<p>Lu A'tu, a villager from Liannuoqiao in Yangming Township, was over seventy years old and a stonemason by trade. He had four sons, all of whom lived separately from their father due to disagreements. A'tu built several thatched houses for himself to shelter from the wind and rain. The day before yesterday, in the evening, A'tu dumped the hot ash from the foot stove into a bamboo sieve. The ash had not been completely extinguished, and in the middle of the night, it caught fire, and the fierce flames were unstoppable. The thatched houses were completely burned down. A'tu, due to his old age, could not escape and was burned to death. It was truly tragic.</p>

<h3>Planning Two New Urban Areas</h3>
<p>Wu County Magistrate Cai Pei recently planned two new urban areas in the northeast and southwest to improve the city's appearance. All plans were submitted to the County Council on the 25th and passed. The northeastern new urban area is located in the northeast of the city, north of Northeast Main Street, near the North Gate Guanhe Road. The southwestern new urban area is located in the southwest of the city, south of Huaide Bridge to the east, including the Carpenter Street south of the South Gate to the west bank of the South New Canal. This western area has recently been building roads, and the market is becoming increasingly prosperous. It is planned to first send personnel to survey the detailed terrain, determine the location and width of the streets, as well as the location of public wells, public toilets, fire stations, and other public facilities, and select a site for a public park. The county administrative meeting has approved this, and it must be actively carried out according to the plan.</p>
<h3>Three Arrested in Robbery and Assault Case</h3>
<p>The home of Zhang Yaoxi in Anning Township, the 16th district of Wu County, was robbed and the owner was injured on the 17th of this month. The case was serious. District Chief Xie Jun of the district tried to gather information and help with the arrest. He learned that fugitives were hiding in Donggu Village, Gubian Township, and secretly sent police and militia to the village. They arrested Yu Quansheng, Ding Fusheng, and Ding Longda, who were suspects in the case. During the preliminary interrogation, Yu Quansheng confessed to participating in the robbery of the Zhang family, saying that there were six people in total, with two guns and a single knife. Ding Fusheng and Ding Longda have not yet provided a clear confession. District Chief Xie escorted the three criminals to the county yesterday (the 25th) for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Female Workers of a Silk Factory Sit-in to Demand Wages</h3>
<p>Yao Jincheng, the manager of Wanfengtai Tobacco Shop in Xiyingli, Wu County, made a profit of over 10,000 yuan from selling silkworm cocoons this spring. He then rented a closed silk factory in Xi and opened for business under the name Qingfeng, employing over 2,000 female workers. However, the silk market fell sharply shortly after opening, leading to losses. Over 10,000 yuan in wages were owed to all staff and female workers, with the female workers accounting for about 6,000 to 7,000 yuan. The female workers, because the factory has been closed for several months and their wages have not been paid, sent over seventy representatives, all wearing the factory badge, to Changzhou from Xi by car around 4:00 PM on the 25th to sit-in at Wanfengtai. As of the evening, there was no solution.</p>

<h3>Water Police Crack Kidnapping Case</h3>
<p>Zhang Bao'san, a resident of Tianxin Bridge in Taixing, had a comfortable family life. In the late night of the 18th of this month, eight bandits suddenly broke into his house with guns and kidnapped Zhang and his four-year-old child to a boat that was waiting nearby. They sailed to the Sanjiangying area. Just as the Ningkou ferry was releasing steam, Zhang heard the sound in the boat and knew he was near the dock. He bravely drew a knife and jumped into the river. The water police on the ferry noticed the person who jumped into the river was bound by ropes, and knew that there must be bandits on the boat. They ordered the boat to stop and arrested five bandits, Gu Shuren and others, on the boat. Zhang Bao'san, the kidnapped victim who jumped into the river, was also rescued. Three other bandits escaped with a small kidnapped victim in a small boat. The bandits were taken to the Bajiaokou team headquarters. After interrogation by Captain Gao Maoting, they confessed. They were escorted to the Guazhou district headquarters for interrogation yesterday.</p>

<h3>Disturbance at the Song Family Elementary School</h3>
<p>The Song Family Elementary School in Changjing Town, the 12th district, was founded by the merchants Song Chuying and Song Cucai, using the Song family ancestral hall as the school building. It has been around for fourteen years, and the number of graduates is no less than three hundred. The school's auditorium is usually used as a staff room and reception room, so it is luxuriously decorated and neatly organized. There are no less than one hundred kinds of forms, mirrors, books, and furnishings on the four walls. However, at 10:30 AM yesterday, during the winter solstice, when the school's third class was about to end, two people suddenly broke into the auditorium. At that time, there were six teachers in the school, four of whom were teaching, and only two were working at their desks. They were shocked. Unexpectedly, the intruders destroyed all the items. At this time, the bell rang to end the class, and the two hundred children in the four classrooms suddenly heard a loud noise and screamed and ran in all directions. Later, the outside world learned about it, and spectators came in droves. Rumors spread in the market, causing a great stir. On the north-south streets and east-west markets, people were either shocked by the riot or suspected robbery. The situation was chaotic for a while. Fortunately, District Chief Wang of the 12th district and Inspector Hu of the Education Bureau happened to be in Chang on business and went to the school to investigate. However, the perpetrators had already fled. After detailed investigation, it was learned that the two were Song Zhonglu and Song Zhongli, graduates of the school. Inspector Hu summoned the two and rebuked them, and then summoned the children, persuaded them to start classes, and reported to the Bureau Chief, strictly demanding impeachment. But it is unknown when the disturbance will subside.</p>

<h3>Water Police Intercept Bandit Ticket</h3>
<p>Xu Wenquan, a patrol officer of the Second Squad of the 15th Brigade of the Water Public Security in Bajiaokou, the fourth district of the county, led police officers on a patrol along the river on the morning of the 25th. He saw a small boat whose movements were suspicious and immediately ordered it to stop. Upon boarding, he found a rifle and arrested the bandit leader Sun Yongqing and rescued the victim Zhang Yusan. After interrogation, Sun confessed that he was fifty-six years old, from Baoying, and had eight accomplices. Zhang Yusan, the victim, was the owner of Zhang Fuxing Wine Shop in Taixing. He was kidnapped by bandits on the night of the 18th of this month. After the team took the confession, they transferred the case to the district headquarters for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Father and Son Fight, Resulting in Homicide</h3>
<p>Tang Xinli, a villager from Tangjiaji Township in Yiling, was sixty-one years old. He had four sons. The eldest son, Tang Zhongyu, was nearly forty years old, had been married for a long time, and had children. Due to discord with his family, he had previously taken his wife and children to rent a house elsewhere. Now, due to the difficulty of maintaining a living, he intended to move back to the old house and discussed it with his father, but did not get his consent. He moved back anyway, which angered his father, and the two had an argument, which then escalated into a fight. Unexpectedly, during the struggle, his father's head suddenly hit the wall and he was injured and died. The village police reported it to the police station, who went to arrest his son Zhongyu. The deceased's wife, Jiang, and relatives Tang Xinghe, Tang Xingxiang, and Tang Rui went to the police station and transferred the case to the court. After a hearing, the court ordered Tang Zhongyu and Tang Xinghe to be detained, and the others were ordered to return home to await trial. Prosecutor Zhu led police officers to examine the body.</p>

<p>The Municipal Government and its subordinate bureaus have been gradually moving since the day before yesterday. The Municipal Bureau of Public Works already began working in the city center area the day before yesterday (the 25th). Other bureaus are also preparing and will all be moved by the end of the year. An opening ceremony will be held on New Year's Day. Details are as follows:</p>

Therefore, all staff have been working at the new address in the city center area since the 25th. As the staff dormitory in the city center area has not yet been completed, the bureau is temporarily hiring cars to travel directly from the bureau's old address in the southern part of the city to the city center area. Once the staff dormitory is completed, some of the bureau staff will move in to avoid the labor of commuting.</p>
<p>The Social and Health Bureaus Begin to Move: The Social and Health Bureaus also began to move on the 25th and are expected to be completed around the 28th. The Municipal Social Bureau has notified all relevant agencies that all official documents and letters to the bureau should be sent to the new address in the city center area after the 28th. After the Municipal Health Bureau moves, the sanitation division of the bureau will set up an office at Penglai Road in the southern part of the city. As most of the staff of the two bureaus also reside in the southern part of the city, cars will be hired for dedicated transportation.</p>
<h3>The Ships of the Bo Song Fleet Sail South</h3>

<p>Many Foreign Residences in Former Cangshan: Afterwards, the reporter learned from reports that Chen Mingshu and others had planned to evacuate to Former Cangshan. It is said that Former Cangshan in Fuzhou has many foreign residences, resembling a concession, so Chen and others reside there, naturally to avoid central government aircraft.</p>
<h3>Disputes Arise Frequently Between Tenants and Landlords Due to Excessive Water Bills</h3>
<p>Ken Yie Denies Collecting Fees from Residents for Well Drilling</p>
<p>The Trial of the Case of the Three Lane Neighborhoods of Bai Fu, etc. is Postponed for Retrial</p>
<p>Since Tonghai Lane, Tongzhou Road, Hongkou, had its water cut off by the British Shanghai Waterworks Company on the 19th of this month, as a result of appeals from all parties and consultations, the water was immediately turned on. According to reports the day before yesterday, the landlord intended to seek a permanent solution by drilling an artesian well and charging each resident a special fee of twenty yuan. Yesterday, the Ken Yie Bank Real Estate Department, the landlord of the lane, denied this. The lawsuit involving the three lane neighborhoods of Bai Fu, Bai Lu, and Bai Shou due to the water bill issue was heard again yesterday, but no results were obtained. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Collection of Fees for Well Drilling is Inaccurate: The Ken Yie Bank Real Estate Department issued a statement yesterday saying, "The report on the 24th of this month said that the water cut-off in Tonghai Lane, Tongzhou Road, Hongkou, has been resolved, and the landlord collected a special fee of twenty-one yuan from the tenants to drill an artesian well. This is slightly different from the facts. The water bill of the lane is very high. In addition to paying the water bill, the landlord asked the tenants to subsidize a small amount, but no results were obtained. After many days of delay, the water was cut off. This was entirely initiated by the British Shanghai Waterworks Company. Although the water pipes have been temporarily reconnected after appeals from all parties, the right to turn on and off the water still depends on whether the water bill is paid. However, after careful examination of the company's letter, it is required that the arrears be settled by the end of this month. Therefore, it is difficult to guarantee that the water will not be cut off again in the future. As for the rent increase, it is absolutely not intended in this time of economic depression. We hope for correction."</p>
<p>Advise Tenants to Cooperate: The Ken Yie Bank, the landlord of Tonghai Lane, issued a notice to the residents and landlords of the lane yesterday, saying, "Since we started managing this lane, we have been on good terms with the residents for several years. Unexpectedly, in December of last year, the British Shanghai Waterworks Company unilaterally cancelled the water package system and installed water meters, resulting in monthly water bills that exceeded the previous bill by two times. Who can afford it in this time of economic depression? And recently, the sudden water cut-off has caused great inconvenience to the residents. Although we have made efforts to appeal, we have only obtained a moment of peace. However, water is essential for life and the demand is urgent. We have repeatedly sent</p>
<p>instructions and have sent special commissioners three times to sincerely negotiate and subsidize the huge water bills used by the residents so that the landlords can afford it. This is to bring the two sides closer and succeed. If the residents do not recognize the water bill at all, how can the landlords afford to pay the full amount? It will inevitably be delayed and there will be no solution. Then, the water cut-off in the future is not far away. At that time, both sides will be injured and the pain will be great. We hope that the residents will not ignore our words, and we have high hopes for that."</p>
<p>Lawsuit Involving the Lane Neighborhoods of Bai Fu, etc.: After the three lane neighborhoods of Bai Fu, Bai Lu, and Bai Shou between Pingliang Road and Fenzhou Road in eastern Shanghai changed to the water meter system, the water bill increased by three to four times, making it difficult for the landlords to afford it. They refused to pay the water bill, and the water was cut off once in May of this year. Then, it was also postponed and opened as a temporary solution. Afterwards, when the Deli Company, the landlord of the lane, dug an artesian well, the water company found out and cut off the water pipe of the temporary emergency source in the late last month. The tenants did not understand the difficulties of the landlord and thought that it was intentionally delayed. Therefore, they specially hired a lawyer to issue a warning, put forward four conditions, and demanded compensation for the loss. The landlord strongly rejected it. Therefore, they could not get any results and filed a lawsuit with the First Special District Court. After the court session on the 19th, the tenants' association organized by the tenants was deemed to be an illegal group because it had not been approved by the party and government authorities. Immediately, more than 190 representatives were elected to file another lawsuit with the First Special District Court under their joint names. The sixth court session was held on the day before yesterday (the 25th). After a brief trial of the plaintiff and defendant, it was deemed that the facts were not clear and witnesses were to be summoned. The trial was rescheduled to January 11. At that time, Kui Yanfang, the chairman of the Real Estate Association, must also be present to testify.</p>
<h3>The Thousand Yuan Silver Bar Policy</h3>
<p>Only Suitable for Clearing Among the Trade</p>
<p>Private Transfer is Not Allowed</p>
<p>——Decision to Issue on New Year's Day——</p>
<p>The Shanghai Mint, in order to facilitate the circulation of existing currency in the financial community, has decided to cast silver bars in two types, A and B, each worth one thousand yuan, to replace existing cash. It has already officially started casting and is scheduled to be officially issued from January 1, 1934. However, it is only suitable for clearing among the trade and private transfer is not allowed. Yesterday, a notice was issued to the Silver and Money Trade Associations that they should be universally used. The text of the circular is as follows: "This is to inform you that we have received Instruction No. 1600 from the Ministry of Finance, which states, 'Article 12 of the Amended Regulations on the Casting of Silver Standard Coins states that the Central Mint may cast factory bars in two types, A and B. Type A weighs 23.493448 grams, with a fineness of 999 per thousand. Type B weighs 26.697.1 grams, with 880 parts silver and 120 parts copper, equivalent to one thousand silver standard coins, all marked on their face.' The Ministry has announced and implemented it, and the Ministry has approved the styles of the two types of factory bars and submitted them to the Executive Yuan for submission to the National Government for record, and ordered the Central Mint to cast them. It is now scheduled that the two types of factory bars, A and B, will be issued on January 1, 1934, to meet the needs of the market. However, Type B factory bars were originally intended to facilitate the collection and distribution among members of the silver and money industry and are not applicable to private transfers, in order to show restrictions. In addition to separately announcing and sending letters, we hereby order the Association to inform and transfer to all members to comply with. The Type B factory bars shall not be used outside of collection and distribution among members of the industry. All banks and money houses must strictly comply with and not exceed the restrictions, otherwise, they will be punished. We hereby inform you.' We hereby record and announce it for your reference.

<h3>The Hengshan Steamer of the Sanbei Shipping Company Runs into Trouble</h3>
<p>Collided with a Ship in Zhenjiang</p>
<p>Ran Aground in Nanjing</p>
<p>The Hengshan steamer of the Sanbei Shipping Company, which sailed to Nanjing on the 23rd of this month, had a tragic accident of sinking a small ship when it arrived in Zhenjiang, and ran aground when it arrived in Nanjing. It can be said that misfortunes never come singly. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Transporting Oil to Zhenjiang: The Chongshan ship usually sails to various ports in the north and south. Recently, it has picked up a large batch of kerosene and machine oil from the Dexijie Foreign Company in this port, which will be loaded and unloaded in Zhenjiang and Nanjing. The ship arrived in Zhenjiang first on the 23rd and stopped at the Dexigu Wharf for unloading.</p>
<p>Colliding with a Large Sand Boat: At 6:05 AM on the 24th, the Hengshan ship arrived in Zhenjiang and stopped at the Dexigu Wharf. When it was mooring, a large sand boat loaded with cargo, named Dingsheng, was sailing upstream. When the Hengshan ship was turning, it could not avoid the collision (according to the shipowner's report), so it crashed into the sand boat. The Dingsheng ship was hit and immediately destroyed. The ship sank into the river, and all the boatmen on board fell into the water. After the accident, the owner of the Hengshan ship quickly released sampan boats and lifebuoys into the water to rescue the people who fell into the water. Another sand boat also heard the alarm and rushed to help.</p>
<p>Ships and Goods Were Destroyed: The Zhenjiang Customs small steamboat received the alarm and flew to the vicinity of the Dexigu Wharf to coordinate with various small boats to rescue the people who fell into the water. The Dingsheng ship and the goods loaded on it have all sunk into the river. The boatmen in the ship were mostly rescued. The sand boat and its cargo suffered great losses. The Zhenjiang Customs small boat is now handling the rescue matters. As for the issue of liability for the accident, both parties must be interrogated before the right and wrong can be determined.</p>
<p>Ranged Aground Again in Nanjing: After this incident, the shipowner has reported to Shanghai by telegram yesterday afternoon. Then, after unloading all the goods in Zhenjiang, it sailed to Nanjing. Yesterday morning, when the ship was about to arrive at the Nanjing Wharf, it ran aground on the shallow water of the river bank again in order to avoid a small naval boat on the river surface. The ship lost its ability to move, and the goods in the ship could not be unloaded. The shipowner sent a telegram to Shanghai to report and asked the Nanjing Sanbei Branch to send a boat to rescue. After several hours, the small boat sent by the Nanjing Branch was able to pull the ship out of the shoal with great effort during high tide in the afternoon. Yesterday afternoon, a telegram had arrived in Shanghai. After the ship collided and ran aground, it is still necessary to return to Shanghai for inspection to determine whether the hull was damaged.</p>
<h3>The Sichuan Disaster Relief Association Held a Representative Conference Yesterday</h3>

<p>The Articles of Association Were Adopted to Actively Carry Out Association Affairs</p>
<p>Although the Sichuan Disaster Relief Association, initiated by the Sichuan Shanghai Fellow Association, has repeatedly appealed to all sectors for relief, it has rarely been effective.

Later, the disaster area was expanded and changed to the Sichuan Disaster Relief Association. It has entertained reporters, petitioned to Beijing, and appealed to the charitable community in this port, but it has been very ineffective. Therefore, it will gather celebrities from Beijing and Shanghai to raise donations first, and then make a final petition for relief to the government and the charitable community in this port.</p>

<h3>The Zhabei Charitable Organizations Sent a Letter to the Xinwei Relief Association</h3>
<p>The Closure of Silk Factories Has Led to a Sudden Increase in Labor Unemployment</p>
<p>Plan to Set Up a Congee Kitchen and Request Funding Assistance</p>
<p>Zhabei was originally a prosperous industrial and commercial area. It was hit hard by the January 28 Incident. In recent months, due to the sharp drop in silk prices, silk factories have closed down one after another, resulting in a sudden increase in labor unemployment. They wander in the streets day and night, exposed to the wind and dew, unable to make a living. In view of this, Zhabei charitable organizations plan to set up a congee kitchen to provide relief. Therefore, yesterday, Wang Binyan, the director of the organization, sent a letter to the Xinwei Relief Association. The original text is as follows: "Zhabei is always crowded with poor people every winter. Our organization has always opened factories to distribute congee. Many old, weak, women, and children go to the factory to eat. A bowl of hot congee is enough to extend their lives. After Zhabei was hit by the war last spring, the local economy has not recovered, and the market is depressed. Many silk factories have closed down due to the sharp drop in prices, and labor unemployment is on the rise. In addition, the rural economy is bankrupt, and there are more poor people than before. In this severe winter weather, they are hungry and cold and cannot survive. The situation is very pitiful. Therefore, this winter, we have to open a congee kitchen (at the Second Congee Kitchen on Liuying Road). To prevent freezing, we ordered craftsmen to repair it as soon as possible to save the general poor people. However, once it is opened, the cost is more than 10,000 or 20,000 yuan. Although some philanthropists have donated recently, it is rare. Last year, we received enthusiastic assistance from your organization, which was enough to provide relief. In view of the current situation of the poor people this winter, we have to ask for your relief and assistance to open the factory as before. Please also widely solicit donations from your organization, so that we can get a steady stream of money and rice to provide relief, so that most of the poor people can be grateful for their rebirth and share the benevolent soup. We are sincerely looking forward to it."</p>
<h3>Records of Contemporary People's Whereabouts</h3>
<p>Kong Xiangxi, Yang Shuzhuang, Chen Zhaoying, Wang Zhengting, and Fang Shengtao took the night express to Beijing last night.</p>
<p>Chen Shaokuan and Zou Lin took the night train out of Beijing last night and will arrive in Shanghai this morning.</p>
<h3>The Social Bureau is Ordered to Stop the Incorporation of Various Industries Under Assumed Names</h3>
<p>Careful Assessment Should Be Conducted During the Preparation Stage</p>
<p>The Social Bureau instructed the Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday, saying, "According to Instruction No. 7855 of the Municipal Government, it is forwarded that according to Consultation No. 21537 from the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, the Jiangsu Provincial Chamber of Commerce Federation submitted a request to stop establishing trade unions under false pretenses in order to avoid disputes. This case is the same as the Ministry's previous general plan to unify the names of trade unions in various places and industries. In addition to sending a letter to the Central People's Movement Guidance Committee and approving the Chamber of Commerce Federation, a copy of the original submission is sent to your bureau for reference and to instruct the Social Bureau to carefully assess and examine the trade unions that apply for preparation in the future in order to avoid disputes. The original submission is attached. With this approval, we order you to send a copy of the original attachment to the Association for compliance and to instruct all affiliated trade unions to comply with. This is the order." The following is an appendix to the Jiangsu Provincial Chamber of Commerce Federation's submission to the Ministry (omitted above): "The Second Meeting of the Current General Assembly of our Association approved the proposal of the Yilin Town Chamber of Commerce, which stated that the organization of trade unions is based on the Trade Union Law, and there is no problem. Unexpectedly, the organizers do not handle matters in accordance with the law. For example, the grocery industry is renamed the South Goods Industry, a guild has already been established in the same industry, but the timber industry is also organized, and a guild has already been established in the same grain industry, but the soybean, wheat, and rice industry is also organized. The purpose is to create opposition at the beginning and gradually start disputes at the end. We should ask the party and government organs of each county to carefully assess and examine the trade unions that apply for preparation in order to avoid disputes and benefit commerce. It was immediately submitted to the General Assembly for discussion, and it was agreed that this case should be approved as it is and instructed the party and government organs of each county to carefully assess and examine the trade unions that apply for preparation in order to prevent abuses. The resolution was unanimously passed and recorded in the minutes. We hereby submit a document for your approval and allow its implementation, which is for the public convenience. Sincerely submitted."</p>

Then, a general meeting will be convened to determine the date of commencement of collection. It is heard that the three major hotels in this city, Dadong, Xin Xin, and Dongya, have already started collecting according to the measures set by the Aviation Association on July 1, and have collected 4,000 to 5,000 yuan so far.</p>

<h3>Duan Zhiquan's Health Improving</h3>
<p>The Guowen News Agency reports that Duan Zhiquan, who is residing in Shanghai for convalescence, fell ill several months ago.

Every morning, he still recites scriptures. During the day, in addition to several games of Go, he enjoys reading novels for relaxation. Wang Yitang recently passed through Shanghai and visited him. They had a very pleasant conversation.</p>
<h3>The Japanese Expel Overseas Chinese on a Large Scale</h3>
<p>A certain vessel returned to Shanghai the previous day and arrived in Shanghai yesterday, looking extremely disheveled. According to reports, Chinese residing in Japan who are engaged in small businesses or work as laborers, even if they have existing jobs, are not allowed to stay because it is said that they are taking away the livelihood of the Japanese. In the past year, no fewer than two or three thousand overseas Chinese from various places have been expelled and returned to their home country. The number of Chinese currently remaining in Japan is less than one-tenth of what it was before. Japanese police are still searching everywhere, and it seems that they will not stop until they have completely expelled all of them.</p>

<h3>Petition to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to Rescue Jin Xi</h3>
<p>Lawyer Xu Visited Jin Xi at the Japanese Consulate Yesterday</p>
<p>Family Members Determined to Organize a Rescue Group to Fight to the Death</p>
<p>The Xinsheng News Agency reports that in the case of Jin Xi's illegal arrest by the Japanese Consulate, the Municipal Government and the French Consulate have negotiated with the Japanese Consulate. After the Japanese side unreasonably refused to hand him over, Jin Xi's family representatives and legal counsel visited the Japanese Consulate again at 11:00 AM yesterday to inquire about the truth. At 4:00 PM, they visited Secretary-General Yu Hongjun of the Municipal Government to petition for negotiation again. They also stated that the Japanese side's unreasonable obstruction was making the situation increasingly tense. In addition to sending letters to various French organizations and petitioning Foreign Minister Wang to negotiate based on reason, they will also unite with Koreans who have already acquired Chinese citizenship to organize a rescue group to do everything possible to rescue him. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Petition to the Municipal Government: Yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, Jin Xi's family representatives Li Shichang and Chen Cijie, along with lawyers Xu Jielou and Yunmei, went to the Municipal Government at Fenglin Bridge to visit Secretary-General Yu Hongjun to request that he promptly lodge a second protest with the Japanese Consul-General so that Jin Xi could regain his freedom as soon as possible. At the same time, they also requested to review the case files of Jin Xi's initial arrest negotiation and the original letters from the French and Japanese Consuls-General to the Municipal Government. The Secretary-General personally received them and showed them the case files and replies. After finally stating their requests, the Secretary-General agreed to immediately submit the case to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for serious negotiation. The representatives were then satisfied and returned.</p>
<p>Inquiry into the Truth: Jin Xi's legal counsel, Xu Jie, went to the Japanese Consulate-General at 11:00 AM yesterday to meet with Ishishe Itaro, the Japanese Consul-General in China, to clarify the truth. After the meeting, he immediately inquired about the reasons for Jin Xi's arrest. The response was that Jin Xi's arrest was related to the bombing of General Shirakawa in Hongkou Park last year and had violated the Japanese law on maintaining public order. After the arrest, a preliminary hearing was held in Shanghai, and he is still being detained at the police station of the Japanese Consulate. Finally, when Lawyer Xu requested to see Jin Xi, the Japanese Consul-General initially refused, but then the police chief agreed to allow a meeting, and they were able to see Jin Xi. However, when the Japanese Consul was asked about the possibility of releasing him, he firmly refused.</p>
<p>Chen Yang's Statement: According to Chen Yang, a representative of the family, who spoke to a Xinsheng News Agency reporter yesterday, after Jin Xi was arrested in the French Concession, his nationality has been completely proven. According to the 1929 Judicial Agreement of the Concession, the French Consulate should be responsible for returning him. According to international private law, the Japanese Consulate's arrest is even more illegal. Therefore, the Chinese and French authorities must lodge a strong protest with the Japanese Consulate and demand his return. Lawyers Lou Yunmei and Xu Jie have carefully reviewed the Shanghai Concession Agreement and international private law. It is believed that the final victory will be based on these two principles. However, this matter is of great importance, and the family's words are weak and light. It seems that it is necessary to have a unified effort from top to bottom, and it may be difficult to overcome the powerful with a weak strategy. Now, in order to concentrate efforts and seek a way to rescue Jin, letters have been sent to various French organizations to form a rescue group, and the law office of Lou Yunmei at 446 Tongdeng Lane, Huage Road, has been designated as the temporary communication address. It is hoped that the wise will guide and assist them as much as possible. Furthermore, since there has been no news of any protest from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, a special petition is submitted to expedite serious negotiation. According to the investigation, there are approximately tens of thousands of Koreans in China, and not a few have already acquired Chinese citizenship. Yesterday, Li Shichang went to various places to report the situation of Jin's arrest to the Koreans, so as to organize a rescue group to fight together.</p>
<p>Letter to Various French Organizations: The family representative's letter to the various French organizations stated: "Greetings. Jin Xi, together with his father Jin Yongduo, naturalized as a Chinese citizen on October 5th, 1929, and executed Permit No. 67 issued by the Ministry of Interior of the National Government. In November of last year, Jin and his father were illegally arrested by the Japanese Consulate, and thanks to the assistance of various French organizations, they were released. Unexpectedly, at around 6:00 PM on November 22nd of this year, he was illegally arrested again by the Japanese Consulate in the French Concession. The representatives have negotiated with the French Consulate according to the law, and the Municipal Government has also lodged a serious protest. More than a month has passed, but he has not been released. The details of the negotiations have been telegraphed to you, which you are aware of. This not only infringes upon personal rights but also damages national sovereignty and international prestige. Therefore, this matter is of great importance, and it is feared that it will be difficult to achieve the final victory without a joint effort. We have always admired your association's upholding of justice and its concern for the interests of the country, society, and the public. We believe that you will definitely sympathize and assist with this case. Since the family's words are weak, we need to concentrate our efforts and have a unified assistance organization to gather strength and make it easier to achieve results. Therefore, we are sending this special letter to request your support. If you agree, please reply by letter or come to discuss and set a date for a meeting so that Jin can be released as soon as possible. The family will be grateful. Jin Xi's family representatives Chen Yangshi and Li Changtong."</p>
<p>Petition to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs: Jin Yongduo, Jin Xi's father, petitioned the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to promptly negotiate seriously with the Japanese Consul-General, stating: "Regarding the petition to lodge a protest, Jin Xi, who naturalized as a Chinese citizen with the petitioner, was arrested by the Shanghai French Concession Central Police Station with the assistance of the Japanese Consulate-General. The petitioner has separately petitioned the Shanghai Municipal Government, your department, and the Shanghai Office, requesting that they forward the matter to your department to lodge a serious protest with the French and Japanese Consulates. For more than ten days, except for the French Consul-General, who has not replied, the Japanese Consul-General has formally replied to the Shanghai Municipal Government, stating that the Japanese government does not recognize that Jin Xi has acquired Chinese citizenship. However, Jin Xi, along with the petitioner, has long since legally obtained Chinese citizenship, and according to Chinese law, Jin Xi should only be recognized as a Chinese national, and his existence as a foreign national outside of China should not be recognized. Moreover, the petitioner and Xi have established their residence within Chinese territory for many years and have nothing to do with Japan in fact. Their jurisdiction should belong to China and should not be infringed upon by the Japanese Consulate-General. Even from the perspective of international private law, even if it is recognized that Jin Xi has an active conflict of internal and external nationality, according to the principles of international private law, even if there is a suspicion of crime, he should be subject to the judgment of Chinese law. The Japanese Consulate-General illegally arrested Chinese citizens, and their whereabouts are unknown. For the sake of protecting the lives of citizens and maintaining national authority, this requires your department to lodge a serious protest with the Japanese Consulate-General. Furthermore, the petitioner and Xi were illegally arrested by the Japanese Consulate-General in the French Concession last year. After the Shanghai Municipal Government protested to the French and Japanese Consulates-General and presented the nationality permit issued by the Ministry of Interior, they were returned by the Japanese Consul-General, and the French Concession authorities released them. The French Concession authorities knew that Jin Xi was a Chinese national in the most important aspect of the relationship. Now, Jin Xi was arrested and handed over with the assistance of the French Central Police Station. The petitioner's representatives, Li Shichang and Lawyer Xu Jie, questioned the French Central Police Station and the French Consul-General, who both claimed that they did not know in advance that Jin Xi had acquired Chinese citizenship. This kind of excuse is obviously to evade the responsibility of violating the 'Agreement on the Establishment of Chinese Courts in the Shanghai French Concession'. Even from the position of the French Consul-General, if it is recognized that Jin Xi has dual nationality, why should only Japanese law be followed and Chinese law be disregarded? Their contempt for our country's national sovereignty has reached its limit. Furthermore, even if the arrest and handover were mistakenly assisted at the time due to not knowing that Jin Xi had acquired Chinese nationality, now that Jin Xi's Chinese nationality has been proven, they should also request his return. Although the French Consul-General notified the Japanese Consul-General, it is not allowed to perfunctorily delay the matter. This requires your department to lodge a serious protest with the French Consul-General and demand the return of Jin Xi. Recently Jin Xi is about to flee to Japan, requesting a prompt separation of the matter to protect the lives of the people and only have empty power, and the sentiment of feeling grateful is at its peak. This is submitted by Wang, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the National Government, and the petitioner Jin Yongduo, residing at 446 Bailaini Mengmalang Road, Shanghai."</p>

<h3>United Association of China Cement Factories Petitions for Exemption from Increased Cement Consolidated Tax</h3>
<p>Domestic Cement Industry Suffering Deeply in Recent Years</p>
<p>We Request Sympathetic Consideration of Commercial Difficulties and the Rescinding of the Order</p>
<p>The United Association of China Cement Factories in this city states that since the Ministry of Finance implemented an increase in the cement consolidated tax on the 5th of this month, the factories have temporarily endured the pain and paid the tax, but the suffering is indescribable. Yesterday, they submitted a special petition to the Tax Affairs Department of the Ministry of Finance, requesting that it be forwarded to the Ministry of Finance to rescind the order and return the additional tax already paid, in order to alleviate the difficulties and maintain the industry. The original petition stated: "Petition for Double Collection of Consolidated Tax, Temporary</p>
<p>Enduring Pain and Paying, Still Requesting the Rescinding of the Order to Maintain Domestic Products and Relieve People's Livelihood. We are in receipt of your department's telegram to Dong Dai, increasing the cement consolidated tax, which was approved by the Executive Yuan meeting proposed by the Ministry and will be implemented uniformly from December 5th of this year. The cement consolidated tax was originally six jiao in national currency per barrel, but now it has been changed to one yuan and two jiao inJia currency. Those packaged in bags are calculated at double the original tax, etc. After receiving the order, the public was shocked. Because the deadline for collection was urgent, the member companies of our association were forced to temporarily endure the pain and pay the tax, but considering the difficulties of the people's livelihood and the dangers of the industry, we dared not resign from trivial matters and explained it to your department in detail. The taxation of domestic cement began in the thirty-third year of Guangxu in the Qing Dynasty. Domestic customs valued at 5% was collected nationwide. Generally, it was acceptable to collect. It was calculated that each barrel actually collected one qian of Guanping silver, equivalent to one jiao and five fen in national currency. It was not until the sixteenth year of the Republic of China that a surtax of 2.5% was added, which was still only equivalent to two jiao and three fen in national currency. Last year, when the consolidated tax was implemented, it suddenly increased to six jiao in national currency per barrel. Now, not long after its implementation, it has suddenly been doubled, which is compared to the old amount,</p>
<p>Increased Eightfold. Even compared to the sixteenth and seventeenth years, it has increased sixfold, which is truly shocking. Our association clearly knows that this tax can be passed on to buyers, but the amount of the increase is too large, and the deadline is too short. Since receiving the telegram, countless disputes have arisen regarding unfinished civil construction projects and orders that have not been cleared by various companies, and there is no way to resolve them. Moreover, cement is necessary for all public and private construction and is not comparable to luxury goods and consumables. Premier Sun Yat-sen advocated people's livelihood and listed it as the top priority of construction. The Three Principles of the People emphasize housing and transportation. The reason why people can live happily and travel conveniently is entirely dependent on cement. If the tax rate is doubled, it is clear that all transportation will be hindered as a result, which is contrary to Premier Sun Yat-sen's intention to build the country. As far as the member companies of our association are concerned, the domestic cement industry has been suffering deeply in recent years due to the influence of the environment. Although we have been given government recognition of foreign goods import tax to provide protection, due to the frequent domestic affairs and the poverty of the people, they have no time to seek food, let alone discuss construction. Therefore, domestic cement production can only be seen selling in large commercial ports. The inland sales market has recently become increasingly narrow. The national production has always felt that supply exceeds demand. If we</p>
<p>Burdened with Heavy Taxes, then users, except for essential uses, will definitely seek alternatives. It can be asserted that not only will the sales of cement be reduced again, but also, in terms of government tax revenue, it is feared that although the tax rate has increased, the amount of revenue will not be as expected. The result of the investigation only sees that it is merely harming merchants and harming the country's treasury. Furthermore, cement payments are mostly on credit. The consolidated tax is handled by each factory paying in advance, which takes about two or three months. The tax rate is heavy, and the amount paid in advance is even greater. The loss of interest is already unmarketable. If customers go bankrupt, they will have to compensate for the tax in addition to the payment for the goods. All of this suffering cannot be expressed in words. Under the collective discussion of the member companies of our association, it is believed that since the increase and amendment of the tax rate have been ordered and implemented on a deadline, we can only endure the pain and temporarily comply with the payment. On the one hand, we still ask your department to sympathize with the people's difficulties and grant the original case of increased tax</p>
<p>To Rescind the Order, and return the additional tax already paid by various companies in full, to alleviate the difficulties and maintain the industry. We are urgently submitting this petition, and we sincerely hope that your department will review and approve it. We are deeply grateful. Respectfully submitted to the Tax Affairs Department of the Ministry of Finance."</p>
<h3>Sino-British Scheduled Communication</h3>
<p>Currently Undergoing Correction Work</p>
<p>The International Telecommunications Bureau of the Ministry of Communications is preparing for Sino-British communication. The four large radios, two 20-kilowatt transmitters, and one telephone ordered from the British Marconi Company have been shipped from England to Shanghai. The radio engineers of the bureau supervised the workers and transported the four radios to Liuhe for installation. The two transmitters and one telephone were transported to the Zhenru Radio Station for separate installation. The various projects have been completed in order. The engineers of the station have been actively carrying out correction work in recent days and checking whether there are any errors in the installed machines. According to the person in charge of the station, who spoke to a reporter from the Xin Xin News Agency, although the construction of the transmitters and radios has been completed, the procedures for line correction are quite complicated. In recent days, engineers have been gathering the applied current in one place and gradually transmitting it to the interior of each machine to start it and test for obstructions. This work is the most complicated and important. It is said that if there is a slight omission during the trial operation of a new machine, it will have a great impact on future communication. Therefore, we must proceed with caution. Once the current can pass through the interior of each machine without obstruction, the second step is to correct whether the sound symbols are clear. The date of the official Sino-British communication must wait until the above projects are completed before it can be determined. According to the current situation, the official communication date will be at the end of January or February next year. This is what the British side can realize. As for the rumor that communication can be carried out on the 10th of next month, it seems difficult to do so in reality.</p>
<h3>Telegraph Bureau Messengers Staged a Brief Strike Yesterday</h3>
<p>Demanding a Raise, the Authorities Immediately Agreed</p>
<p>Returned to Normal After Only Half an Hour</p>
<p>The Central News Agency reports that the Shanghai Telegraph Bureau messengers of the Ministry of Communications suddenly went on strike at 2:00 PM yesterday to demand a raise. Since Hua Shijian, the director of the bureau's business, immediately expressed his acceptance of the messengers' demands, the turmoil disappeared invisibly after half an hour. The Central News Agency reporter learned the details of the incident as follows:</p>
<p>Delegates Elected: The bureau has a total of sixty-three messengers who work in shifts every day. In previous years, there was a practice of seniority-based salary increases. In July of last year, all the messengers received a general monthly salary increase of two yuan. There was hope for another increase in July of this year, but the Telegraph Bureau did not grant it due to certain reasons. Although the messengers made three requests, they did not get a clear answer. Therefore, when the messengers arrived at the bureau yesterday morning, they held a temporary meeting and decided to elect delegates to make a final request to Director Hua. The delegates elected were Jing Dafa, Xia Shuntang, Yang Zhicheng, Ding Wenhe, and four others.</p>
<p>Brief Strike: At 2:00 PM yesterday, all the messengers gathered in the courtyard of the bureau, and the delegates, Jing Dafa and the other four, requested that Director Hua give a reply to the salary increase issue. Director Hua did not give a concrete reply to the messengers' request. The four delegates were unable to get a clear answer and conveyed this situation to all the messengers. All the messengers, unable to get their request met, announced a strike.</p>
<p>Salary Increase Approved: However, due to the tense situation in recent days, thousands of telegrams have been sent back and forth every day. The messengers' strike had a significant impact. Director Hua, in order to take the overall situation into account, immediately issued an order stating, "The messengers of this bureau will receive a salary increase according to the example of the Wireless Telegraph Station, and I will submit it to the Ministry for approval in the near future, allowing the increase from July of this year." The messengers, seeing that Director Hua had already expressed his acceptance, immediately announced the resumption of work. At this time, it was already 2:30 PM, so the actual strike time was only half an hour. After 3:00 PM, the messengers had returned to delivering telegrams as usual.</p>
<p>Conclusion: According to the messengers' account of the incident, the Ministry of Communications promulgated the Regulations for the Management of Messengers in March of this year, which stipulated performance-based salary increases. Performance is evaluated twice a year, and salary increases are implemented at the end of the year based on the results of the evaluation. Salary increases should have started in July of this year, but although the messengers made repeated requests, they did not get a clear answer. The management regulations promulgated by the Ministry of Communications originally did not distinguish between wired and wireless telegraphs. Now, the messengers of the Wireless Telegraph Station have already implemented salary increases in July of this year, so the messengers of this bureau should also have the same benefits. Therefore, the messengers of this bureau believed that the authorities' refusal to grant a salary increase was inappropriate. However, now that Director Hua has expressed his acceptance, it can be said that this incident has come to a conclusion.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Industry Plans to Establish a Fish Market in the City Center to Save Fishery Losses</h3>
<p>Capital Set at 1.5 Million Yuan</p>
<p>Please Invest Actively</p>
<p>In order to improve the future of the fishing industry, the Ministry of Industry has formulated various plans, such as building meteorological stations and adding naval vessels, which have been implemented one after another. Recently, the Ministry, noting that fish merchants are gathered in this city, goods are leaking and crowded, and there is a lack of a proper market to concentrate them, allowing foreign countries to manipulate this great interest, and that imported marine products are even more flooding the market, with annual losses of tens of millions of yuan, in order to salvage and improve the situation, plans to organize a large-scale fish market in the city center, with a capital of 1.5 million yuan. It has specially dispatched Counselor Yu Kaizhan to Shanghai with various plans and drawings to contact Mr. Du Yuesheng, Chairman of the Fish and Fresh Seafood Trade Association of this city, and request that the fish merchants invest 500,000 yuan. It is reported that Mr. Du has agreed to the request and has contacted various fish merchants separately. However, the fish merchants, because the year is coming to an end, the New Year is approaching, and the market is sluggish and money is tight, although they approve of the plan, they are unable to do so due to lack of strength. It is feared that it will be difficult to achieve the desired result in a short time. As for the Ministry of Industry, the matter is imperative. It is reported that preparations have begun and Counselor Yu has been ordered to report the situation in detail within this week so that a decision can be made.</p>
<h3>Road Bureau Increases Freight Charges for Bulky and Explosive Goods</h3>
<p>The Traffic Departments of the Beijing-Shanghai, Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways, yesterday issued a notice to the Traffic Department of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway, the Transportation Section of the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway, the Joint Transportation Settlement Office of the Ministry of Railways, the various transportation companies of the two railways, and the station staff of the two railways, stating that upon investigation, loading and unloading workers at various stations have been privately receiving subsidies or setting separate fee amounts for loading and unloading dangerous explosives and bulky goods, due to different working conditions. Although these subsidies are largely voluntary from the shippers, they still violate railway regulations. In light of this, this office has decided to increase the loading and unloading rates for dangerous explosives and bulky goods, and issue clear regulations. At the same time, all illegal subsidies will be rejected. The revised fee rates have been submitted to the Management Bureau for approval under Vehicle Order No. 915. It is now necessary to copy and issue the fee rate table to all for notification, effective from January 1, 1934. Attached is the loading and unloading fee rate table for dangerous explosives and bulky goods (based on actual weight per piece):</p>
<p>Not exceeding 500 kilograms</p>
<p>Exceeding 500 kilograms up to 1,000 kilograms</p>
<p>For each additional 500 kilograms up to 5,000 kilograms</p>
<p>(Bulky Goods) 　　(Dangerous Explosives)</p>
<p>Calculated according to the prescribed rate 　　Collected at double the prescribed rate</p>
<p>Collected at double the prescribed rate 　　Progressively increased according to the prescribed rate</p>
<p>Progressively increased once according to the prescribed rate 　　Can be further increased</p>
<p>For example, if it is 750 kilograms, which exceeds 500 kilograms but does not exceed 1,000 kilograms, the ordinary rate is 2 silver cents per 50 kilograms, and the charge should be 3 silver dimes, doubled to 6 silver dimes, 1 silver dollar and 2 silver dimes. (1,100 kilograms is not exceeding 1,500 kilograms), the ordinary rate is 2 silver cents per 50 kilograms, and the charge should be 4 silver dimes and 4 silver cents, doubled to 8 silver dimes and 8 silver cents, 1 silver dollar, 7 silver dimes and 6 silver cents. (1) If the prescribed rate is 1 silver cent per 50 kilograms, it should be increased by 1 cent. (2) If loading and unloading is done with a crane, it should be calculated according to the prescribed ordinary rate.</p>
<h3>Forgery of Lead Coin Making Equipment Uncovered</h3>
<p>Lu Ying, the captain of the detective team of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, recently received a tip that someone was privately manufacturing lead coin making equipment at No. 12 Jingshun Lane, Xuxu Road, Nanshi, in the jurisdiction of the Second District of this city, casting and selling them for circulation in the city. Captain Lu, at 7:30 PM yesterday, ordered detectives Xu Youliang, Gu Rusheng, Wang Hongyi, Zhao Jinquan, and Liu Shaoqing, the detective foreman stationed in the district, to lead plainclothes police officers to the aforementioned location, where they uncovered the counterfeit coin making equipment and seized four lead coin molds (printed with versions of Yuan Shikai and Sun Yat-sen), four angular coin molds, 16 lead coins, 45 lead angular coins, and arrested Jiang Yuanfa, 44 years old, from Nanjing; Wu Linchang, 47 years old, from Zhenjiang; Wang Shunlin, 38 years old, from Changzhou; Zhao Shunren, 56 years old, from Nanjing; Ji Zhangshi, 40 years old, from Nanjing; and the second landlord, Zhou Guocai, 34 years old, from Nanjing. The above eight criminals, as well as the lead plates and lead coins, were all taken to the district, where District Chief Li briefly interrogated them and prepared a document for submission to the General Bureau for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Municipal Government Takes Over China Public Hospital</h3>
<p>Health Bureau to Take Over Tomorrow</p>
<p>The China Public Hospital in Nanshi was established in October of the Gengxu year of the Xuantong reign of the Qing Dynasty, due to a quarantine crisis in the Shanghai Concession. At that time, public sentiment was anxious and nearly caused a major incident. Later, the hospital was established after negotiations with the Concession authorities for self-quarantine, in order to uphold national sovereignty. It has been in operation for 24 years, specializing in the treatment of infectious diseases such as plague, smallpox, scarlet fever, and diphtheria. Now, the Municipal Government Health Bureau believes that these epidemic prevention matters are the responsibility of the Health Bureau, so it has specially requested approval from the Municipal Government to negotiate with the hospital, with the Health Bureau responsible for managing it, to benefit the citizens. The China Public Hospital convened a meeting of all its directors and decided that epidemic prevention is a matter of local public interest, and decided to lease all its real estate and equipment to the Health Bureau, with the bureau paying an annual rent of 1,200 silver dollars. The Health Bureau has now decided to send personnel to take over tomorrow (the 28th), and has formulated rectification plans and is expanding the internal medical equipment to make it the only municipal epidemic hospital.</p>
<h3>Rice Merchant Guild Re-elects Executive and Supervisory Committee Members</h3>
<p>Half of the members, seven people, were drawn yesterday</p>
<p>Elections to be held again today</p>
<p>The Shanghai Rice Merchant Guild, in order to re-elect half of the executive and supervisory committee members, convened a general meeting of all members at the Rice Merchant Guild on Danfeng Street in the city at around 3 PM yesterday, and invited representatives from Party and government agencies and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to attend the meeting to conduct the re-election in accordance with the law. He Yuanming, representative of the Municipal Party Department, Xie Jinan, representative of the Social Affairs Bureau, and Li Ruzhang, representative of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, attended the meeting. After the meeting was opened as scheduled, Lu Wenshao, chairman of the guild, reported on guild affairs and explained the purpose of the meeting. The election was then held. The guild has 15 committee members: Chairman Lu Wenshao, Standing Committee Members Zhang Nianxuan, Shi Hongxun, Xu Jingzhi, Huang Gengbo, Executive Committee Members Wang Weiquan, Qu Zhenhua, Gong Zhaoming, Huang Shenkang, Zhang Heming, Chen Shaolian, Lu Guishan, Lu Jingwen, Xu Zhenyu, and Shu Zhanyuan. Before the election began, seven members were drawn out, and their names are as follows: Xu Jingzhi, Huang Gengbo, Wang Weiquan, Gong Zhaoming, Huang Shenkang, Lu Guishan, and Shu Zhanyuan. Because the guild has more than one thousand and twenty members, and only one-tenth of them attended yesterday, it was decided to hold another election today.</p>
<h3>Various Lawyers' Associations Oppose Courts Collecting Delivery Fees</h3>
<p>Four Points of Opinion Listed</p>
<p>The Shanghai Wu County, Dai Jiang and Jiangning Lawyers' Associations, in order to oppose the courts' collection of delivery fees for service of summons and travel expenses for lawyers handling civil cases, held a joint meeting and decided to nominate the Shanghai Lawyers' Association to draft a document, affix their signatures and seals, and submit it to the Ministry of Judicial Administration requesting the withdrawal of the order. The Shanghai Lawyers' Association appointed a drafting committee, which prepared a draft and submitted it to the Standing Committee for revision and issuance. The document was sealed and sent to the Wu County Lawyers' Association, and then submitted to the Ministry of Judicial Administration. The original text is as follows: A petition to request the withdrawal of the order to collect delivery fees for service of summons to lawyers acting as agents in civil cases. It is based on the instruction of the Jiangsu Higher Court, which in turn is based on Instruction No. 265 of your ministry, which states: Article 158 and Article 243 of the Civil Procedure Law stipulate that lawyers acting as agents in litigation should also be served with summons. The notice that has been used all along is in the nature of a summons, and therefore delivery fees should be collected in accordance with the regulations. Upon receiving this, our associations have learned that your ministry's reference to Article 158 and Article 243 of the Civil Procedure Law is based on the fact that (1) lawyers' notices should not be regarded as summons; (2) lawyers are not parties to the litigation; (3) the rules of the local lawyers' associations stipulate that official letters should be used for lawyers' notices. The Wuchang Lawyers' Association in September of this year and the Wuhu Cangwu Lawyers' Association in October of the same year have submitted documents explaining this matter, so there is no need to repeat it. Now, we will present our humble opinions as follows: (1) The current Civil Procedure Law adopts the principle of party litigation, and does not directly summon lawyers acting as agents. Lawyers in the position of agents are also not directly obligated to be summoned by the same law. From the basic concept of the Civil Procedure Law, lawyers' notices cannot be compared with summons. Moreover, in countries that adopt the principle of mandatory lawyer litigation, notices are used for lawyers acting as agents in civil litigation, and summons are not used, nor is the nature of the notice regarded as a summons (such as the Civil Procedure Laws of Germany, Austria, and Switzerland). From the perspective of the legislative principle of the Civil Procedure Law, it should not be considered that the nature of notices and summons are equivalent. (2) Lawyers are one of the three judicial professions, they wear uniforms in court, and have seats in the courtroom, which is clearly different from the parties to litigation in the Civil Procedure Law. From the perspective of the position of lawyers, lawyers' notices should not be regarded as summons. (3) Since the establishment of courts in China more than 20 years ago, the courts have used notices for lawyers' court dates, and the former Ministry of Justice has specified the format of these notices and specially printed paper for them. It is very clear that their nature cannot be regarded as summons. It is untenable to say that notices are essentially summons. (4) Litigation costs cannot be collected unless they are based on the revised rules on litigation costs. The rules do not explicitly stipulate the collection of delivery fees for lawyers' notices, so the collection is without legal basis, and lawyers should not be obligated to bear the delivery fees. Based on the above opinions, our associations believe that the collection of lawyers' delivery fees is a small matter, but it greatly affects the status of lawyers. Therefore, we urgently submit this statement and attach the documents and telegrams from the Wuchang, Wuhu, and Cangwu Lawyers' Associations, requesting your ministry to review and approve the suspension of the collection of delivery fees for service of summons to lawyers acting as agents in civil litigation, which would be a great favor. Respectfully submitted to the Ministry of Judicial Administration. (Attachments omitted) Respectfully submitted by the Shanghai, Jiangnan, Zhenjiang, Wu County and other lawyers' associations, with their names and seals affixed.</p>
<h3>Dredging Bureau Orders Large Offshore Dredger</h3>
<p>The Dredging Bureau had previously decided to dredge the Shentan shoal outside the Wusong estuary in response to requests from various Chinese and foreign shipping and transportation companies and the Homing Chamber of Commerce, and had increased the dredging tax, but it has not yet been implemented because the Dredging Bureau's existing dredgers can only dredge the Huangpu River and cannot dredge the offshore area. Therefore, the Bureau's Chief Engineer, Chadley, advertised in European and American newspapers for bids for a self-propelled, trailing suction hopper dredger. A certain German iron factory has been selected to build it, at a cost of over 4 million national currency. It will not be completed until the end of next year, and will sail to Shanghai under its own power. It will begin dredging the Shentan shoal in the spring of the year after next. The Bureau's Director, Song Ziliang, has submitted a report to the government for approval, and it is said that Director Song plans to send Xue, the Deputy Engineer of the Bureau's Mechanical Department, to Germany to supervise the construction of the dredger in order to ensure its perfection.</p>
<h3>Rental Vehicles Should Be Submitted to the Ministry of Railways for Approval</h3>
<p>Ministry of Railways Instructs Railway Bureaus to Comply</p>
<p>The Ministry of Railways has instructed railway bureaus to comply with the rule that all rental vehicles must first be submitted to the Ministry for approval. The order states: "Due to the impact of years of military conflict, the losses suffered by various railways cannot be calculated. In particular, the lack of vehicles and the repeated damage and loss of vehicles have made it impossible to maintain the current transportation status of the bureaus. Therefore, there are regulations for railway bureaus to rent vehicles to each other to make adjustments, and this has been handled in the past. However, it has been found that there are cases where Railway A rents vehicles to Railway B, or rents them to merchants, without reporting to the Ministry, or even after the contract has been signed. This is not in compliance with the regulations. In the future, when Railway A rents vehicles to Railway B, both railways should first submit all relevant regulations to the Ministry for approval. As for renting vehicles to merchants, the regulations should be carefully drafted and submitted to the Ministry for approval. In addition to separate orders, you are hereby instructed to comply with this order."</p>
<h3>Third Lottery of Aviation Bonds to be Drawn the Day After Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Fourth Lottery to be Issued as Usual</p>
<p>The third lottery of aviation bonds is scheduled to be drawn publicly at 10:00 AM the day after tomorrow (the 29th) at the Yiyuan in Avenue Albert. All sectors are welcome to attend and observe. The fourth lottery of bonds has already been printed and is scheduled to be drawn on February 28th of next year. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Drawing the Day After Tomorrow: All procedures for the drawing of this lottery will be the same as for the second lottery. The Ministry of Finance will send a representative to give a speech, but the person has not yet been determined. Zhang Shouyong will not be able to attend due to personal business. According to the local Dayun Company, as of 4:00 PM yesterday, 280,000 bonds had been sold. The company has contracted for 300,000 aviation bonds, which are being distributed in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hubei, and Sichuan provinces. It is expected that all bonds will be sold out by the morning of the 29th. It is also reported that sales in Beijing have increased.</p>
<p>Change in Drawing Method: The method of drawing the lottery has been changed for the seventh prize. After the first, second, third, fourth, fifth, and sixth prizes have been drawn, the seventh prize will be drawn. The seventh prize has 500 numbers. Another ball will be used for the drawing. The ball contains 500 balls numbered from "000" to "499." The number drawn will be the last three digits of the seventh prize number. For example, if the number drawn is "123," then all bonds with the last three digits "123" will be seventh prizes, and each will receive 200 yuan. All winning bonds can be redeemed at the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications seven days later.</p>
<p>Continued Issuance in the Next Round: According to news from the local Aviation Bonds Office, the fourth lottery of bonds will continue to be issued. The rumor that the issuance will be suspended is completely inaccurate. When reporters visited the office yesterday, they saw that the fourth lottery of bonds had already been completely printed and was being packaged and inspected. It is scheduled to be drawn at the Yiyuan at 10:00 AM on February 28th of next year.</p>

Now they are gathered together to study and work together for the benefit of patients, which is of great significance.</p>
<h3>Chongde Hall Donates Clothing for Disaster Relief</h3>

On the evening of July 28th of this year, Xu and Shao were returning home from the Far Eastern Hotel for dinner when they were suddenly shot and killed by thugs on Route Wagner in the French Concession. At that time, detectives chased the assassins. Because the assassins opened fire and resisted arrest, one of the assassins, Li Shigen, was shot and killed. The others scattered and fled. Later, the French police arrested Zhang Bingrong, a lacquer craftsman from Ningbo, and sent him to the Second Special District Court. After interrogation, he was sentenced to 15 years in prison.

The Higher Court has completed the trial. Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, Chief Judge Guo, accompanied by Judges Fan and Sun, announced the judgment in the Third Criminal Court. The original judgment was revoked. Zhang Bingrong was found guilty of jointly plotting murder and sentenced to life imprisonment.

They followed her to her house, pulled out weapons, threatened and intimidated her, first snatched her gold bracelet, and then broke into the bedroom and robbed her at will.

<h3>Continued Capture of Bandits Reveals Robbery Case</h3>
<p>Su Changsheng and Yang Peisheng, Chinese detectives of the Yulin Road Police Station, previously arrested Wang Yuezhi, a bandit from Chongming, on Route Huaide. After questioning, they learned that his accomplices Cao Azhi and Lu Chuanming were waiting at the teahouse at No. 393 on the same road. They went together and continued to arrest them. They discovered that the firearms were hidden at the home of Teng Yan, a woman from Haimen, at No. 2 Baishou Lane, Huasheng Road. The detectives secretly went there and searched two rice baskets in the stove room of the house, where they found two Browning pistols, a packet of ammunition, and 28 bullets. They brought them and Teng Yan back to the police station. After questioning, they learned that they and the fugitives Chen Cailang and Gu Zhengkang planned to rob the property of a certain milk shed on Route Huaide on the evening of the 15th of this month. They were sent to the First Special Court for interrogation and detention. A few days ago, Judge Wu Zehan came to the Third Criminal Court to continue the trial. Zhang Tianyin, the lawyer for the police station, stated that the investigation had revealed that they planned to rob the Huaxing Milk Shed on Huasheng Road that evening. Wang Yuezhi was sent to the location to scout out the exits and was arrested. He now adds that the defendants, at around 7:00 PM on January 18th of this year, held weapons and organized a gang to rob the Huasheng Tobacco Company at No. 53 Anle Lane, Route Huaide, of 264 yuan in wages. The defendants admitted at the police station that Gu Zhengkang, who is still at large, was the leader and held a pistol, and that they divided the loot at his house afterwards. When asked about this, the defendants' statements were evasive. Judge Wu ordered them to be detained separately and scheduled a sentencing date.</p>

Later, Zhou invited Li's sister and brother Li Jun to rush to the Zhongnan Bank to open the box and inspect its contents.</p>
<h3>Trial Opens for the Zhang Bingqian Slaying Case</h3>
<p>Murderers Zhou Gougou and Chen Jinfa Still Trying to Shirk Responsibility</p>
<p>Family of the Deceased Brings Private Suit Seeking 7,000 Yuan in Damages</p>
<p>The Deceased's Aged Mother Also Appeared in Court Yesterday</p>
<p>Zhang Bingqian, a native of this county, lived in Yinxiang Port and was a street paver. On the afternoon of November 18th this year (i.e., the first day of the tenth month of the lunar calendar), he was hacked to death by two companions, Chen Jinfa and Zhou Gougou, with knives. Afterwards, the responsible police station apprehended the two murderers, Chen and Zhou, and handed them over to the local court. Prosecutor Yang interrogated them once, decided to place Zhou Gougou in shackles, and separately detained Chen Jinfa. He went to the scene, verified the corpse, confirmed that he had been hacked to death with knives, filled out the forms, and ordered the corpse to be coffined and buried, pending further investigation. It is now learned that this case has been preliminarily reviewed and determined that Zhou Gougou and Chen Jinfa are jointly guilty of violating Article 282, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law. Therefore, in accordance with Article 253, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law, a public prosecution has been filed. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Luo Renji specially opened the Third Tribunal for trial. The court appointed lawyer Hu Yuanjun to defend the two defendants, Zhou and Chen. The family of the deceased retained Zhang Bao-</p>
<p>Tang as their lawyer to request</p>
<p>Private Suit for 7,000 Yuan The judge took the bench and ordered Chen Jinfa, age 33, a native of Shanghai residing at No. 20 Lu Bridge, Yinxiang Port, and a drain worker (i.e., street paver), to be brought to the dock. (Question) Did you kill Zhang Bingqian? (Answer) I did not kill him. At that time, I was already asleep at home. The deceased's nephew, Lin Sheng, came to knock on the door. After I got up and opened the door, they dragged me away, saying that I killed someone. But I returned home from Shanghai on that day (i.e., the first day of the tenth month). Passing through Yangjiabang, I saw Zhou Gougou eating tea in a stove shop there. He asked me if my life was good. I answered that it was not yet finished. At that time, Zhang Bingqian was also sipping tea nearby. Zhang asked me who asked you to do this job. I answered that it was a person surnamed Zhou who was in charge and asked me to do it. At that time, he argued with me, and the owner of the teahouse,</p>
<p>Wang Jinwen, broke it up (Question) Did the police try to break it up? (Answer) No. (Question) Where are you working? (Answer) I am working in Xujiahui. (Question) In the Fifth District Fourth Precinct police station, you confessed that you were drunk in Yangjiabang on the afternoon of that day. Later, you went to the teahouse to drink tea and asked Zhang Bingqian for his wages, and then you quarreled. After being persuaded, Zhou Gougou went home and got a kitchen knife, and I caught up behind him and cut Zhang first, and then Zhou Gougou cut him. (Answer) Because I was tortured three times, and put on the tiger bench, I could not bear the punishment, and even died three times. I did not kill Zhang Bingqian, etc. According to Zhou Gougou's confession, age 38, a native of Shanghai, residing at No. 15 Yangjiabang, also a drain worker. (Question) Were you and Zhang Bingqian working together? (Answer) Yes. (Question) Did you lure Zhang Bingqian to Shijiabang and kill him with a knife? (Answer) I did not kill him. (Question) When were you arrested by the police? (Answer) On the night of the first day of the tenth month. (Question) Is the knife yours? (Answer) Yes, because the police station used the tiger bench to torture me privately. The judge showed the murder weapon and</p>
<p>A white short shirt with blood stains</p>
<p>to Zhou and asked if it was his. (Answer)</p>
<p>Yes, but the stains on the short shirt are not blood, but rust from the knife. (Question) Did you quarrel in the teahouse first? (Answer) Chen Jinfa and Zhang Bingqian quarreled. (Question) How many people were eating tea there? (Answer) Me, Chen Jinfa, Zhang Bingqian, and three others. We were all good friends. I left first, and Chen Jinfa left later. The officer said, "You confessed in the Fifth District Fourth Precinct that you and Chen Jinfa were drinking in Yangjiabang and started a fight because you asked Zhang for 1.6 yuan in wages. You went home to get a knife and waited for Chen Jinfa on the way. Chen cut Zhang first, and Zhang fell to the ground, and then you hacked him three times." Zhou was speechless. The officer ordered witness Wang Jinwen, age 58, who runs the Xinfayuan stove shop in Yangjiabang, Yinxiang Port, to be brought to the dock. (Question) When did Chen Jinfa and others drink tea in your teahouse? (Answer) Around 7:00 PM on the first day of the tenth month. They came together. (Question) How did the fight start? (Answer) Zhang Bingqian</p>
<p>Asked Jinfa for his wages Later, Zhou Gou told Chen Jinfa to leave first. About a quarter of an hour later, Zhang Bingqian also left. (Question) Did a policeman come? (Answer) Yes, but the policeman came to drink tea. When they quarreled, this policeman also tried to break it up, etc. Chen and Zhou left first, and Zhang left later. At about 8:00 PM, when I was patrolling the road in Shijiabang, I found that the deceased had been hacked to death. I immediately returned to the station to report. I arrested Zhou Gougou and Chen Jinfa one after another. The murder weapon was found in Zhou Gougou's room. According to Zhou, the blood stains on the knife were wiped off with straw paper, and the straw paper was discarded in the latrine, etc. Zhang Yulong testified, age 30, serving as a patrol officer in the Fifth District Fourth Precinct. His testimony was the same as Li Minggao's. Zhang Jinfa testified, age 52, a native of Shanghai, residing in Shijiabang, Yinxiang Port. The deceased, Zhang Bingqian, was my younger brother. I still have a</p>
<p>74-year-old mother Zhang Lu Shi, and sister-in-law Zhang Chen Shi (i.e., the deceased's wife). (Question) You submitted a complaint today to pursue a private suit. How much money do you want to pursue? (Answer) 7,000 or 8,000 yuan, because the children still have to go to school. I spent 300 or 400 yuan on funeral expenses. The officer said, "How much do you want? You can't just say it casually." (Answer) At least 7,000 yuan. The officer ordered Zhang Lu Shi to be brought to the dock, but she was old and senile, deaf and blind, and had to be helped into court. Her answers were irrelevant. The officer ordered her to be removed. The deceased's wife, Zhang Chen Shi, testified, age 39. My husband was brutally murdered by Chen Jinfa and Zhou Gougou. I request redress and ask for future living expenses. At this point, the lawyer hired by the family of the deceased stood up and said, "Please pursue a private suit. The deceased's monthly wage was 40 yuan. The two defendants should jointly bear 7,000 yuan," etc. As a result, the officer ordered further review. Zhou Gougou and Chen Jinfa were ordered to be returned to custody separately.</p>
<p>that only one deposit slip of 2,000 yuan was left in the box. All other items were missing. Knowing that Shi had concealed and secretly transported them in an attempt to embezzle them alone, she immediately hired a lawyer to investigate the various banks. Only then did she learn that Shi had transferred the funds to the Shanghai Citibank under the name of Zhou Li-Xiguang, totaling 100,000 yuan, with a fixed term of one year. She then asked the bank to stop the transaction and asked people to find Shi's whereabouts. On the evening of the 24th, she learned that Shi was hiding in room 718 of the Yangtze Hotel on Fuzhou Road. She reported to the Laozha Police Station, and Chinese and Western detectives were dispatched to the hotel at 11:30 that night. Shi was arrested and taken to the police station. Under questioning, the head of the police stated that Shi resided in the French Concession and should be handled by the French police. Therefore, detectives were dispatched overnight to transfer Shi and the plaintiff Zhou Li-kai to the French police station. After a brief interrogation by the head of the police, Shi was ordered to be temporarily detained. Yesterday afternoon, she was escorted to the Criminal Court No. 8 of the Second Special District Court, where she was brought before Judge Sun Peng-xian for questioning. The police lawyer Fei Xizhen stated that the police had not yet investigated the case and requested a postponement to temporarily detain the defendant and then investigate the case to request a trial. The plaintiff was represented by lawyers Zhang Shizhao and Xiang Xun, who requested to bring a private suit to recover the seized property. After the court verified the report and briefly questioned Shi, it ordered a postponement to January 5 for further investigation and questioning. The defendant was returned to custody pending instructions.</p>
<h3>Zhao Wei-xian Sues Wei Ting-rong Case</h3>
<p>Wei Requests Postponement Due to Illness</p>
<p>Zhao Wei-xian, a native of Henan, previously hired a lawyer to file a complaint with the Second Special District Court, accusing Wei Ting-rong, the former commander of the Chinese Volunteer Corps in the French Concession and a director of the French Municipal Council, and his son Wei Yuan-sheng of false accusation, kidnapping, and ransom. The court had previously summoned them once, but because the French Concession authorities, based on the latter part of Article 12, Paragraph 2 of the Convention, appointed a lawyer to attend the litigation, it was ordered to wait for instructions from a higher level before summoning them again. Yesterday afternoon, it was time for the continued trial, and the details have been reported in the newspapers. It is now learned that the defendant was temporarily unwell due to a cold, so he entrusted a lawyer to request a postponement. The court approved the request, so the court did not open yesterday afternoon and will wait for the court to set another date for summoning and hearing.</p>

<h3>Xiang Hai Confectionery Factory Opens New Branch</h3>
<p>Candy is a daily necessity, and in recent years, with the increasing number of Chinese people who enjoy it, the number of foreign imports has been very large. Domestic candies are often not well researched, so upper-class people do not hesitate to pay high prices and only favor foreign goods. The Xiang Hai Machine Confectionery Factory in this city is purely Chinese-owned. It has various new-style machines and uses scientific methods to refine high-quality candies. The products are beautiful and hygienic, and the selling price is also quite low. They have already become popular in China, which can resist foreign goods. The factory has expanded its business and specially established a distribution center in the National Goods Market in Sanyuanfang, Hangzhou, and a retail department in the Central National Goods Department Store on Nanjing Road in this city, so that people in Shanghai and Hangzhou can easily purchase them. It is expected that good domestic products will be more popular and can reduce one source of outflow.</p>
<h3>A Son of Wealth Studies Aeroplanes In France And Goes Ashore In Hong Kong Halfway.</h3>
<p>The Absurd Behavior of Wan Junyao, A Wealthy Playboy.</p>
<p>Abandoning Father and Loving Wife to Live with Two Dancing Girls</p>
<p>—His Wife, Zhang Weizhen, Has Already Sued For Divorce—</p>
<p>Wang Zijing, a compradore of a certain foreign firm, lives at No. 20 Lian'anfang, Yuyuan Road, West Shanghai, and has assets of 400,000 to 500,000. His son, Junyao, is 21 years old. On October 4th of last year, he married Zhang Weizhen as his wife. They are both the same age, so their feelings have become closer after marriage. Wang Zijing is pleased to have such a fine son and daughter-in-law. Unexpectedly, Junyao's will is extraordinarily weak. He likes to frequent dance halls and song theatres, and is easily susceptible to bad influences. Before long, he abandoned his beautiful wife and formed an inextricable bond with a famous dancing girl who was the protagonist in the previous case of Tong Sanmao's love suicide. Their love is deep and their happiness is great. Soon he felt that the strict restraint of his father and the gentle persuasion of his wife at home made it impossible for him to do what he wanted. Therefore, on February 28th of this year, he used the excuse of going to France to study aviation skills in order to serve the country in the future. He asked his father to allow him to study in France. Seeing that his beloved son had such great aspirations to ride the wind and break the waves, Zijing of course agreed and immediately granted his request. His wife, Zhang Zhuzhen, hoped that her husband would become famous and also provided eight hundred and fifty yuan as travel expenses. Who knew that Junyao, after receiving the money, still felt that the amount was small and difficult to spend for a longer period of time. He took the opportunity to steal a diamond ring weighing more than two carats from his wife's dowry. So, the family said goodbye and shook hands with each other. Then, Junyao had a pre-existing scheme. When the ship arrived in Hong Kong, he suddenly went ashore and changed to another ship to return to Shanghai. He rented a house with his lover and lived together. As time passed, the matter was revealed. His father felt deeply distressed, but there was nothing he could do. His wife allowed him to not return. Until May, Junyao suddenly said that his love with the dancing girl had broken down and that they were not like lovebirds, but like swallows separating. Although they had a son, they abandoned them like rubbish. The dancing girl was like a dream.</p>

<p>Carry a cone and leave, Junyao, after this emotional turbulence, still does not feel disillusioned. Therefore, he soon made an alliance with another dancing girl and agreed to live together, treating his family as a hostel and his flesh and blood as strangers. One day, he was at a banquet at a friend Zhu Shaobo's house, and his wife was also present. Junyao actually turned a blind eye and did not recognize her. In early autumn, Zhang Weizhen gave birth to a daughter. Junyao not only did not return home to ask, but also sent a letter to his wife, advocating divorce. The absurdity of his wording and the strength of his attitude made Zhang even more resentful. She believed that her husband had a malicious intention to abandon her, so she hired lawyer Fa Yiping to file a complaint with the First Special District Court, requesting mediation. Later, because the mediation could not be successful, Jiang Law Firm officially filed a lawsuit against Wang Junyao for cohabitation and requested that the defendant be ordered to pay alimony of 80,000 yuan, and that the loan of 850 yuan and a diamond ring be ordered to be returned. Yesterday morning, Judge Luo Chongtai of the court opened the trial. Both the plaintiff and the defendant were not present, and lawyer Jiang Chenming stated the intention of the lawsuit. The defendant also hired a lawyer to defend himself, denying the plaintiff's claim for the loan and diamond ring, and filed a counterclaim requesting permission to divorce, saying that the plaintiff had lung disease. This disease is infectious. If the defendant cohabited with her, he would be infected and his life would be in danger. Moreover, the defendant must study abroad, and if he has lung disease, he will have difficulty passing the physical examination. Therefore, he must apply for divorce. Lawyer Jiang said that since the defendant denied borrowing money and stealing the diamond ring, he must provide evidence to prove it. Therefore, he requested a postponement to summon both parties to the case. Not only could the plaintiff prove these two things, but it would also be clear whether the defendant was referring to the plaintiff's lung disease. Judge Luo then ordered a postponement to the 8th of next month for another hearing.</p>

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>Sir, I have read the news item published in your newspaper on the 23rd of this month about the Cotton Control Association stabilizing yarn prices. The section on continuing to release new yarn mentioned that a certain factory continued to release 8,000 bales of secondary yarn. According to the discussion at that time, only new yarn was to be released, and there was no mention of secondary yarn. The content of the manuscript is also inconsistent with the title, which is probably a slight misunderstanding in the interview, resulting in a slight difference. I am sending a special letter to you and ask that you please publish it in the letter column and correct it to show the facts. I will be very grateful. Sincerely, The National Economic Council Cotton Control Association, December 26th.</p>

<h3>Next Year's Plan for Railway Business and Intermodal Transportation</h3>
<p>Since Mr. Yu Yanyan, Director of the Business Department and Director of the Intermodal Transportation Department of the Ministry of Railways, was ordered last summer to serve as the Director of the Business Department and Director of the Intermodal Transportation Department of the Ministry of Railways, he has been planning day and night, striving to reorganize railway business and intermodal transportation. There should be a plan for reorganizing national railway business and intermodal transportation, in order to have comprehensive regulations and implement them step by step. It is divided into four parts: business, transportation, intermodal transportation, and personnel. The focus of attention is: in terms of business, how to increase transportation business; in terms of transportation, how to increase transportation capacity to bear the increased transportation business; in terms of intermodal transportation, how to increase transportation business on the one hand and increase transportation capacity on the other hand; in terms of personnel, how to make the implementation of the above methods as beneficial as possible. In other words, the business, transportation, and intermodal transportation departments all focus on "methods of governance," while the personnel department focuses on "governing people," because "methods of governance" and "governing people" must be combined before things can be done. For more than a year, with the guidance of the Vice-Minister and the assistance of colleagues, many of the plans have been implemented in order of urgency, and the results are gradually becoming apparent. If given more time, all other reorganization plans will not be difficult to implement and achieve results. Here are the main points of this plan, which I would like to inform the people of the country. This is Mr. Yan's plan for the coming year.</p>
<p>(A) Complete the Responsible Transportation of Goods by National Railways. All railways in the world are responsible for transportation. This is a matter of course and nothing special. However, the railway transportation in our country is actually the responsibility of the merchants themselves, which causes suffering for merchants, all kinds of malpractices, and almost endless impact. I have often thought to myself that if we talk about improving railway business today, there is no other more urgent plan than organizing responsible transportation. Therefore, at the beginning of my tenure, I made organizing responsible transportation my sole urgent task. In May of the 21st year, I presented a proposal to organize a Goods Responsible Transportation Committee and formulate various regulations. On September 1st of the same year, the Jinpu, Jinghu, and Huhangyong lines were the first to implement it. Subsequently, the Longhai, Jiaoji, Beining, Pinghan, PingSui, Xiang'e, Zhengtai, Daoqing, and Nanxun lines also implemented it one after another. Merchants found it convenient, and freight transportation was revitalized. Although responsible transportation has been implemented on various lines, given the closed-mindedness of our people and the deep-rooted habits of various lines, it is impossible to achieve perfect implementation and thorough reform overnight. Therefore, it is planned to urgently seek a second step of improvement, in order to reach the best possible realm and achieve the completion of responsible transportation. The improvement plans are roughly as follows: (1) Guide freight merchants. The railway is a transportation provider, and its counterpart is the freight merchant who needs transportation. To improve railway transportation, it depends on the efforts and cooperation of both parties. Because railway transportation has not been responsible in the past, few freight owners in our country directly trade with the railway. All goods are entrusted to transshipment merchants to handle. As a result, they lack transportation knowledge and a small number of unscrupulous transshipment merchants take advantage of this opportunity to extort money in addition to legitimate expenses, causing freight owners to suffer all kinds of pain without knowing what to do. Freight owners should consider whether it is more economical to entrust the railway directly or indirectly, depending on the quantity and frequency of the goods they ship. Transshipment merchants should try their best to make it convenient for freight owners, solicit business for the railway, and ensure that both freight owners and the railway are economical. Only then can they survive and develop, and fulfill their responsibilities in the entire national economy. It is planned to select competent personnel from each line, send them to relevant cities, market wharves, and rural areas, and use written or oral methods to vigorously publicize the benefits of responsible transportation, the procedures for consignment and receipt, and the responsibilities of freight owners, transportation merchants, and the railway, so that freight owners and transportation merchants can understand how to strive for transportation convenience and economic costs, and seek business development in the general economic trend. (2) Train railway employees. The completion of responsible transportation depends on the cooperation of freight owners and transportation merchants, but if railway employees still regard themselves as government agencies and act arrogantly, or do not understand the various rules of responsible transportation, or are negligent or delay the acceptance and storage of goods, it will be enough to hinder the development of responsible transportation. Therefore, employees at all railway stations must be trained to make their work scientific and their services commercialized. It is planned to select competent employees from each line, train them first, and then let these employees train other employees, or send those who already have a considerable understanding and experience of responsible transportation to train at various stations. In addition to providing them with knowledge training, they will also be given spiritual and moral training to ensure that they are loyal to their duties and fulfill their duties. (3) Implement inspection methods. The above two methods are all positive plans to complete responsible transportation, but methods must also be formulated to eliminate old habits and prevent new malpractices, so that inspections can be carried out. This inspection method is divided into three types: one is accounting audit, one is vehicle inspection, and one is the dispatch of personnel by the Ministry at any time for secret inspection. The detailed methods will be formulated and implemented immediately. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Ministry of Education Inspector Zhou Bangdao Discusses the Current Situation of Education in Shaanxi</h3>
<p>After returning to Beijing from inspecting education in Shaanxi and Henan, Ministry of Education Inspector Zhou Bangdao is compiling a detailed report on his inspection of education in the two provinces. The following is a preliminary account of the education situation in Shaanxi as discussed by Inspector Zhou in a private conversation.</p>
<p>(1) General Situation: Due to years of famine and banditry in Shaanxi Province, rural areas have gone bankrupt, and society is disturbed. The education cause has been repeatedly suspended in the past few years, suffering great losses. Students' thoughts are extreme, and the academic atmosphere is unusually arrogant. Strange dramas such as expelling teachers and beating principals are often heard. In recent years, the harvest of farmland has been slightly better, and society is more stable than before. The Department of Education has also earnestly focused on rectification. Therefore, various types of education have a spirit of renewal and restoration. Students are also gradually returning to the right track.</p>
<p>(2) Education Funding: The amount of education funding in the province is very small. This year's provincial education funding totals 921,378 yuan, of which more than 102,000 yuan is allocated to educational administration, more than 348,000 yuan to middle schools, more than 192,000 yuan to normal schools, more than 84,000 yuan to vocational education, more than 119,000 yuan to elementary education, and more than 73,000 yuan to social education. Generally, 80% is distributed. In addition to more than 100,000 yuan in Nanzheng County and more than 80,000 yuan in Chang'an County, most of the other counties have 4,000 to 5,000 yuan to 7,000 to 8,000 yuan for education funding.</p>
<p>(3) Educational Institutions: Schools and social education institutions at all levels in the province include: (1) "Middle Schools": Provincial schools include Xi'an High School, No. 1 Middle School, Zhongshan Middle School, Fengxiang No. 2 Middle School, Sanyuan No. 3 Middle School, No. 1 Girls' Middle School, Nanzheng No. 5 Middle School, Yulin No. 6 Middle School, and Ankang No. 7 Middle School, for a total of nine schools (No. 4 Middle School has been suspended). There are also six county-run schools, two joint schools, and six private schools. (2) "Normal Schools": Provincial schools include Xi'an No. 1 Normal School, No. 1 Girls' Normal School, Dali No. 2 Normal School, Nanzheng No. 5 Normal School, No. 2 Girls' Normal School, Ankang No. 7 Normal School, and Yulin No. 3 Girls' Normal School, for a total of seven schools. (Nos. 3, 4, and 6 Normal Schools have been suspended.) There is also one provincial elementary school teacher training center and twelve county-run normal school training courses. (3) "Vocational Schools": Provincial schools include Xi'an No. 1 Vocational School and Sanyuan No. 3 Vocational School (No. 2 Vocational School has been suspended). There are also two county-run schools, one joint school, and one private school. (4) "Elementary Schools": There are six provincial complete elementary schools, 5,458 county-run junior elementary schools, 117 senior elementary schools, 125 complete elementary schools, 3,545 private junior elementary schools, 12 senior elementary schools, 44 complete elementary schools, and 47 public and private kindergartens. (5) "Social Education": Public social education institutions include eight public education centers, 60 libraries (and one private), 754 public schools, 72 reading rooms, 41 gymnasiums, and 75 lecture halls.</p>
<p>(4) Personnel Treatment: The treatment of education personnel is very low. Provincial schools issue 80% of their salaries and then deduct 10% (Shaanxi Provincial Bank notes), and they cannot be received on a monthly basis. The salary amount of county schools is very small, and there are also many discounts and arrears. Private schools live within their means and pay by the hour. The monthly income is often not enough to maintain personal life. The director of the Education Department receives a monthly salary of 120 yuan, and the secretary section chief and inspector receive 80 to 100 yuan per month. With the discount on paper money, the income is meager, but the spirit of service has not diminished because of this, which is commendable.</p>
<p>(5) County Educational Administration: Only ten counties in the province retain county education bureaus. Those that have been abolished are handled in two ways: one is to set up an education assistant in the county government, and the other is to have a certain section of the county government handle it concurrently. Because there is no dedicated person in charge, the efficiency of educational administration is extremely low. For example, the various school laws and regulations recently promulgated by the Ministry have not been transferred to the schools. To revitalize and popularize education, it is necessary to restore the education bureau first.</p>
<p>(6) Elementary Education: There are still senior elementary schools established independently, which is very inappropriate. Those that use the old name of model or the new name of experiment are actually no different from ordinary elementary schools. The first phase of compulsory elementary schools and short-term elementary schools are only run in one or two counties. The provincial and county elementary schools in Chang'an City are doing well, but the provincial elementary schools are more affected by politics, and some facilities are not as good as county elementary schools.</p>
<p>(7) Secondary Education: The provincial middle schools have now been reorganized, and the service spirit of the faculty and staff and the learning spirit of the students are commendable. However, the educational equipment is extremely simple. Except for the senior high school, most of the physics and chemistry instruments and medicines were purchased ten years ago. Due to military and banditry and other influences, there are few remaining. The senior high school inherits the Northwest University and Zhongshan University. The school buildings are spacious, the equipment is sufficient, and the teachers are relatively good. It is worthy of being a leading school in the province. No. 1 Middle School, No. 2 Middle School, No. 3 Middle School, and Zhongzhong Middle School are doing well, and the students have good discipline. The students of the private Rose Girls' Middle School have excellent achievements in drawing and embroidery, but the faculty and staff are too old-fashioned and relatively backward in terms of new education facilities. The private Xianlin Middle School has a long history and a quiet environment. The achievements of production education are unmatched by general middle schools, but the student movement seems to be not very well organized recently.</p>
<p>(8) Normal Education: According to what I saw at the No. 1 Normal School and No. 1 Girls' Normal School, the provincial normal schools are doing a serious job. However, the junior high school classes are more than the normal school classes, which is not in line with the original intention of establishing normal schools. The elementary school teacher training center is for each county to send two to three incumbent elementary school teachers to the center for one semester of training, and then return to the county to serve. The first phase is limited to the counties in Guanzhong, the second phase is Shaanan, and the third phase is Shaanbei. The plan is good, and the implementation is quite spirited. The term of the normal school training courses in various counties is one or two years, which is too short. The equipment, curriculum, and teachers are also inadequate.</p>
<p>(9) Vocational Education: The provincial No. 1 Vocational School runs agriculture, forestry, reclamation, and animal husbandry courses, and the No. 3 Vocational School runs weaving and dyeing courses. The school buildings are spacious, and the farms and factories are large. However, most of the graduates become elementary school teachers or army scribes, and there is no way out for the profession they have learned. The products of weaving, dyeing, and sewing at the Xi'an Private Civilian Women's Vocational School are excellent. Students can earn several yuan a month in remuneration. The school is small in scale, but it is pragmatic and gradually expanding, and it has made many contributions to women's occupations. The Huayin County Weaving and Dyeing Factory has now been changed to a vocational school and a remedial school. The foundation is very good. It is also appropriate to run a factory first and then a school. The person in charge, Li Zhonggui, invented many spinning and weaving machines, which are cheap and beautiful, and greatly contribute to the promotion of vocational education. The Yulin Gongli Shaanbei Vocational School has a long-standing reputation. The various products displayed in the Xi'an Public Education Center are also exquisite. It is said that Inspector Zhou received a telegram from the school in Xi'an requesting him to go there, but due to transportation and time constraints, he did not visit.</p>
<p>(7) Social Education: The Xi'an Provincial Public Education Center is conveniently located, the buildings are neat and elegant, and the layout and equipment are quite complete. All kinds of work are also quite tense. The Provincial Library has spacious buildings and a rich collection of books. The collection of books includes integrated collections, Tibetan scriptures, and works by philosophers from Qin, many of which are rare treasures. The Department of Education has set up dozens of public schools in Xi'an, distributed in different districts, and each district has an experimental public school to lead and coordinate, which is managed and carried out by the Public School Management Office with considerable success. Social education in various counties is mostly nominal due to the knowledge, ability, and sense of responsibility of the people who run it.</p>
<p>(11) Local Education: Inspector Zhou said that among the counties he visited, Chang'an was the best, followed by Sanyuan, Huaxian, and Weinan. Sanyuan County has financial difficulties, but the school staff are diligent, self-sacrificing, and dedicated to public service. Their enthusiasm and perseverance are commendable. There is only one complete elementary school and one junior elementary school in Wugong City. The school buildings and equipment of the former are still considerable, while the latter is not much different from ordinary private schools. Fengxiang lacks normal school talents, so although there are several elementary schools, the results are not very good. Huayin is holding a competition and examination for all subjects in all elementary schools, which is similar to the semester final examination. The education assistant is in charge of the work with great enthusiasm.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Regularly Convenes Meeting of Public Education Committee</h3>
<p>The meeting is scheduled to be held for three days starting on January 11th.</p>
<p>There are a total of 18 committee members and 9 agenda items.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education invited many public education experts to the Ministry in February of this month to hold a meeting to discuss the implementation plan of public education. After that, it issued an order to all provinces and cities to establish their respective provincial and municipal public education committees. According to the reports received by the Ministry, all provinces and cities in the country have been formally established one after another. However, the members of the Public Education Committee of the Ministry of Education have been appointed for a long time, but because the draft of the public education plan has not been drafted in detail and completed, it has been delayed for a long time. It is heard that the Ministry of Education has now drafted nine plans including the method of promoting public education. Yesterday, the Social Education Department printed and sent them to the education departments of fourteen provinces and cities, including Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Shandong, Anhui, Henan, Jiangxi, Hubei, Hunan, Hebei, Guangdong, Beijing, Shanghai Qingdao, Beiping, etc., to ask them to sign and comment on their opinions and send them to the Ministry before January 8th. And send letters to experts such as Chen Lijiang and Li Zheng to seek opinions on the draft, so that they can be submitted to the Public Education Committee for discussion.</p>
<p>Meeting Schedule: The first meeting of the Public Education Committee of the Ministry of Education has been scheduled to be held at the Ministry of Education at 9:00 am on January 11th. The meeting period is scheduled for the 11th, 12th, and 13th, three days. Yesterday, the printed public education draft and meeting notice were sent to all committee members, asking them to sign and comment on the draft, or if they have any proposals, they must be sent to the Ministry before January 8th in order to compile the agenda.</p>
<p>List of Committee Members: Central Party Headquarters representatives Chen Lifu, Wang Qi, Ministry of Interior Wang Xianqiang, Ministry of Industry Xu Tinghu, Ministry of Education Duan Xipeng, Qian Changzhao, Director of the Social Affairs Department of the Ministry of Education Zhang Jiong, Peng Baichuan, Zhong Lingxiu, directors in charge of the Social Affairs Department, Counselor Chen Panzao, Inspector Zhong Daozan, experts and committee members hired by the Ministry of Education Niu Yongjian, Chen Jianxiao, Meng Xiancheng, Liang Shuming, Gao Jianxi, Yan Yangchu, Xiang Jutan.</p>
<p>Nine Agenda Items: (1) Method of promoting public schools, (2) Draft regulations for public schools, (3) Draft amendments to the temporary regulations for public education centers, (4) Regulations for the Public School Curriculum Standards Compilation Committee, (5) Case of compiling and reviewing public reading materials, (6) Draft method of promoting vocational remedial education, (7) Case of improving and enriching national libraries, (8) Draft regulations for the appointment and treatment of social education personnel, (9) Draft regulations for public education areas in provinces, cities, and counties.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Urges Provinces to Report Standards for Secondary School Funding</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education previously formulated standards for the equipment and funding distribution of secondary schools, with vocational schools accounting for 40%, ordinary middle schools 35%, and normal schools 25%. It issued an order to all provinces and cities to follow the standards, prepare implementation plans, and submit them to the Ministry for verification by the end of this year. At present, the Ministry of Education has only received the plans from six provinces and cities, including Shanxi, Suiyuan, Hubei, Hunan, Shanghai, and Qinghai.

<h3>Zhejiang Province's Measures for the Custody and Payment of Special Education Funds</h3>
<p>Before Zhejiang designated the custody of special education funds, the receipt and payment procedures were in accordance with the unified receipt and expenditure relationship of the province's finances, and the Finance Department allocated funds on a monthly basis. Although the provincial treasury has always been extremely difficult, the Finance Department has been able to allocate funds to provincial education institutions as a priority. This time, Inspector Dai Xia, dispatched by the Ministry of Education, came to the province to assist in planning the independent education funding in the province. Now the measures for the custody and payment of special education funds have been discussed and approved by the provincial government and reported to the central government for approval and record, and will be implemented accordingly. In the future, the funding of various education institutions in the province will be more guaranteed and stable. The province's education funding totals 2,106,436 yuan. Now it is decided to implement the measures for the custody and payment of special education funds. The important points are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Designate foil business tax, 1.2 million yuan per year, the full amount of tobacco and alcohol surtax, about 200,000 yuan, and the full amount of slaughter business tax, about 600,000 yuan, for a total of about 2 million yuan.</p>
<p>(2) The aforementioned three tax revenues will be allocated to the province's special education funds and implemented in three phases. In the first phase, the foil business tax will be allocated 90,000 yuan per month, totaling 1.08 million yuan per year, starting in November of the 22nd year. In the second phase, the foil business tax will be allocated 100,000 yuan per month, totaling 1.2 million yuan per year, and the tobacco and alcohol tax will be 200,000 yuan per year, for a total of 1.4 million yuan, starting in July of the 23rd year.</p>
<p>In the third phase, the foil business tax will be allocated 100,000 yuan per month, totaling 1.2 million yuan per year, the tobacco and alcohol surtax will be 200,000 yuan, and the slaughter business tax will be 600,000 yuan, for a total of 2 million yuan, starting in May of the 24th year. The foil business tax in this article should be allocated to the special education funds on a monthly basis as a priority. Before the designated amount for the month has been allocated in full, it shall not be used for other purposes.</p>

<p>The China Education Construction Society, organized by Sun Yuanzeng, Teng Yangyou, Cheng Kuanzheng, Zhang Zhongcui, Wu Zhiqian, and other colleagues in the domestic education sector, aims to promote the production of education. Since the society felt that the Chinese countryside was increasingly bankrupt, it jointly established the Huangdu Chicken Farm with the Huangdu Rural Teachers' College this spring to improve rural sideline occupations and make production education the center of its efforts. The chicken farm is located in Huangdu, where water and land transportation is extremely convenient. It is reported that the construction of the chicken farm and all equipment cost about 2,000 yuan. This year, there are 250 laying hens, and everything is managed according to scientific methods. Experts have also been hired as technicians for the farm.

<h3>Jinda High School Students Expel Director</h3>
<p>(Shen Shi News Agency, local dispatch) All the students of the Affiliated High School of National Jinan University, dissatisfied with the director of the department, Kuang Songling, after the first class, united with more than 100 students from the high school and normal school departments, using steel bedposts as weapons, and forcibly expelled Director Kuang and other faculty and staff, and surrounded and closed the classrooms and offices. The high school department has been completely suspended. President Zheng Hongnian has urgently telegraphed the Ministry of Education twice to report the matter.</p>
<p>Faculty Meeting: After Kuang Songling and the faculty withdrew from the school, they held a meeting with the faculty and staff yesterday afternoon to discuss how to deal with the situation. They all believed that the students' actions were tyrannical and should be severely corrected. It was resolved to ask the president to severely punish them, and if necessary, disband the school, which would not be hesitated.</p>
<p>Kuang Songling's Statement: Yesterday, Kuang Songling told a Shen Shi News Agency reporter that he has been in charge of the school affairs of the Affiliated High School of Jinan University for more than a year, and unfortunately, this kind of turmoil has occurred, which he deeply regrets. However, he has been running schools for many years, and has always advocated strict rectification of the school spirit. Now that a turmoil has occurred in the Affiliated High School of Jinan University and the students are so arrogant, he will never succumb to it. He does not care about his position, and if the students do not realize their mistakes, he and all the faculty and staff will decide to stop teaching, suspend classes, and disband the school from today, which is not enough to talk about rectification. He has already talked about this with President Zheng, who also agrees with him, and believes that if the students still insist, he will take the final step and deal with it strictly.</p>
<p>Telegraph to the Ministry for Instructions: When the turmoil broke out, President Zheng Hongnian, unable to cope with the situation, immediately telegraphed the Ministry of Education in Nanjing to report the truth of the student unrest and request instructions on how to deal with it. Later, at about 4 p.m., he telegraphed the Ministry of Education again to give a detailed account of the student unrest and requested that the students who participated in the unrest be severely punished in order to maintain the school spirit. After the telegram was sent, it is expected that a reply will be received tomorrow, and President Zheng will decide on how to deal with the matter after the Ministry's order arrives.</p>

<h3>The Second Final of the Pudong Yuqing Middle School Football Tournament</h3>

<h3>The Lianglu Football Team Won Its First Battle in the A Group</h3>
<p>The A group lost to the Lingnan team by a score of 6 to 5</p>
<p>The B group lost badly by a score of 0 to 5</p>
<p>The Lianglu Football Team played its first game since its establishment yesterday at the Chinese Football Field. The opponent was the Lingnan Team. Both sides were divided into A and B groups and played successively. Starting at 2 p.m., the B group game started first. After the contact, the difference was immediately determined. Because the players in the B group of Lianglu team did too little practice on weekdays, they fought on their own and had no contact. In particular, those who were in charge of the forwards were not good at running, which was a fatal injury. Therefore, as a result, the ratio became 5 to 0, and the Lianglu team suffered a crushing defeat. At 3 o'clock, the two sides changed to the A group team and restarted the game. The players in the A group of the Lianglu team were all veterans who had been fighting on the battlefield for a long time and had a good reputation. Their skills were agile and extraordinary. At the beginning of the game, they took the offensive, so the ball often hovered in front of the Lingnan team's goal. In the first half, they scored four goals and lost only one goal. Unexpectedly, in the second half, their strength was greatly reduced, so they retreated to the defensive position, and lost four goals in a row. Later, they desperately counterattacked and scored two goals. Therefore, the final result was 6 to 5, and the Lianglu team won.</p>

<h3>Guanglu Cup Junior Football Competition: Yellow Black Champions, Qiqiao Jia Runners-Up</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Pudong Guanglu Sports Association, considering that junior football in Pudong was not as prevalent as in Punan and Puxi, after the conclusion of the Puxi competitions, Gu Zhigao, Wang Zelin, Gu Zhiying, Cao Yulin, and others initiated the Guanglu Cup competition, soliciting participation from various football teams in Pudong. This was purely for promotional purposes, with no fees charged. The competition has been ongoing for over two months, and the finalists were Yellow Black and Qiqiao Jia. Yellow Black brought together junior football stars such as Huang Guorong, Fu Zhibin, Weng Kefa, Wu Jiugao, and others, forming a strong team. Qiqiao Jia was a disguised version of the Qixing team, the champion of the Puxi junior football competition. The two sides were evenly matched, and the final was held at 2:00 PM on the 24th, with referee Mr. Shun Zhigao. The match was full of exciting moments, with spectators frequently cheering. In the end, Yellow Black defeated Qiqiao Jia by a score of 4 to 3, winning the Guanglu Cup presented by the Guanglu Sports Association. The runner-up prize, a silver shield, was personally presented by Mr. Cao Yulin, an official of Guanglu, on the spot. The guests and hosts dispersed in joy.</p>

<h3>Prospering the Market</h3>
<p>— Xu Xiaoting</p>
<p>Floods, droughts, trampling on agriculture, since the bankruptcy of the rural economy in our country, the provinces and counties in the interior, due to the depression of commerce and sluggish business, the market is poor and deserted. Even the most prosperous and flourishing thoroughfares of the past have, in the blink of an eye, become sparsely populated and filled with death. Under this abnormal development where large cities in the country are becoming more and more developed, and small cities in the interior are becoming more and more squeezed, the society in the interior is like a person who has lost his soul, a rigid situation. The deathly atmosphere of society is already filling the upper layers of the city streets, not just on the ground.</p>
<p>The prosperity of large cities includes cinemas, dance halls, public prostitutes, private prostitutes, and other waiting places, dens for seeking entertainment. Bureaucrats, politicians, and capitalists attract all kinds of people. Cities in the interior fundamentally do not have such beautiful constructions. Once they become deserted, it is like a terminally ill patient with lung disease. Although there is a need to find ways to treat and save them, there is no appropriate method.</p>
<p>Generally, enlightened gentlemen and commercial giants who are worried about the depression of commerce are earnestly and sincerely exploring and researching plans to revitalize the market in order to save this stubborn trend. However, exploration is only exploration. The coldness of the market, all the crowds, are still falling into the abyss of decline, struggling, sighing, and unable to find a ray of hope!</p>
<p>Those who advocate superstition take this situation to launch god-welcoming festivals and perform plays to thank the gods in order to attract the attention of the public and give society a shot in the arm. Friends who hope for commercial development hold big sales and create prize-giving shopping methods in order to stimulate people's purchasing power and compensate for their own business failures. As a result, soap bubbles played by children can only be enjoyed for a while. After this period, they still embark on a miserable path of coldness, decline, and failure!</p>
<p>Since the inland society takes commercial development as the center of market prosperity, and now the commerce of each county is generally showing a downturn, it is really not an easy task for us to demand that a dead society embark on the road to prosperity today. Generally, enlightened people who are worried about the times, although holding twelve points of enthusiasm, try to transform and remedy, and stubbornly want to dig out brilliant gold mines on the surface soil, but this matter is like a dark and cloudy morning, stubbornly hoping for the arrival of sunlight, which is absolutely impossible.</p>
<h3>Understanding of Dealing with the World</h3>
<p>— Holding Buddha</p>
<p>This golden rule of knowledge is more precious than any knowledge and is not easy to graduate from. Friends who are successful and wealthy have sufficient mastery of this knowledge and have already obtained a diploma. Friends who are frustrated and unsuccessful have no understanding of this knowledge at all. Because there are few people with mastery and many people without understanding, there are few successful and wealthy people in the world and many frustrated and unsuccessful people.</p>
<p>In the ocean, a big fish can swallow hundreds of small fish in one bite. Everyone is a fish, all are equal, why can big fish eat small fish? Big fish and small fish can breathe freely and swim freely in the sea. Why do small fish never shout "injustice" when they are eaten by big fish? What good fortune does the big fish have, what crime does the small fish have? When we deal with the world and have this "understanding," we don't have to complain.</p>
<p>Friends with unyielding integrity are unwilling to wag their tails and beg for pity, or to flatter with shoulders and smiles. Looking at the arrogance and imperiousness of the wealthy and powerful, they are often full of anger and unhappy. In fact, they are wrong! The way the wealthy and powerful look at us is not like the way we look at beggars and tramps, is it? Who of us is willing to treat beggars favorably or respect tramps? Of course, who among the wealthy and powerful will treat us favorably and respect us? In the current era, I am afraid that even if Zhuge Liang were reborn, there would definitely be no Liu Bei who would visit his thatched hut three times; let alone us! With this "understanding" of modern society, we will naturally be "calm" and "harmonious."</p>

<p>Random Talk on Cartoons</p>
<p>— Qian Yun Writes, Wen Dongliang Draws</p>
<p>Shanghai's So-Called "Shoutou" (Fool)</p>
<p>"Shoutou" is originally something to celebrate, but in Shanghai, it is used to scold people!</p>
<p>For example, when you go to a Peking opera theater or cinema, you take a dollar to buy a ticket, and the ruthless person will find the change by using copper coins, dimes, and dime notes, tangling you up to the point of dizziness. Even when you finally finish calculating and hand it over, instead of praising you for being well-behaved, they scold you "Shoutou."</p>
<p>By analogy, those who can show off are understanding (well-behaved), while those who tighten their belts and hang themselves ("economical") are undoubtedly "Shoutou"!</p>
<h3>Four Company Commanders of the Northeast</h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 21: Muttering Before the Lamp, Heartfelt Instructions to Weak Offspring; Strolling Under the Mountain, Coldly Watching Heroes</p>
<p>Gan Jizhi had been walking along, with his head down, lost in thought. He really hadn't expected that the person he was thinking about was walking towards him. At this moment, he heard someone say "Eh," and suddenly looked up, only to see Guizhi. Although he couldn't help but be startled, he was, after all, a person who often socialized outside, so he quickly calmed down, reached out and took off his hat, bowed to her with a smile and said, "Long time no see." Guizhi took two steps back, bit her lip, flicked her eyelids, smiled at him and said, "Gan-ye can say this to me, but I can't say this to Gan Er-ye." Jizhi said, "What are you talking about? I don't quite understand." Guizhi smiled and said, "A few days ago, I passed by your mansion's gate and saw Er-ye walking back and forth in the courtyard. Er-ye was busy and didn't see me." Jizhi held his hat in both hands and cupped his hands at her repeatedly, saying, "I'm so sorry!" Guizhi stayed where she was, two steps back, just staring at Jizhi with a smile on her face, without saying anything. Jizhi, because she had nothing to say, couldn't think of what to say in response for a moment. The two people stood facing each other in this desolate field, like a pair of stone figures. Jizhi immediately felt that this was not a solution, so he smiled at Guizhi and said, "Da Guniang, when will you give us wedding wine to drink? I'm glad to have made it back to Haidian this time in time for this opportunity." He was originally just making conversation, using this sentence to defuse the awkwardness of standing opposite each other. He didn't expect that if he hadn't said this, it would have been fine. As soon as he said this, Guizhi felt even more embarrassed; her cheeks were as if they were being baked by a stove, red all the way to the roots of her ears. The upper eyelids of her two eyes were drooping down at the same time, clustering out two lines of eyelashes. Two small fake jade leaf rings were hanging on her ears, and at this time, they suddenly fluttered and swayed, tumbling next to her neck, which showed how her muscles were trembling. (278)</p>
<h3>Winter in the North</h3>
<p>— Huang Kewei</p>
<p>The north country has neither intoxicating spring nor scorching summer. The four seasons are yellow sand flying and sunlight dim, showing a desolate and cold climate.</p>
<p>When the gentle and beautiful Jiangnan is the season of roaring north winds and thick frost covering tiles, the north country has become a world of ice and snow.</p>
<p>In the fields and valleys, it melts into a crystalline snow scene. The heavily laden camels, donkeys, and horses make crunching noises, leaving deep footprints. The fur merchants riding on high backs, wearing leather coats, with their ears and heads covered in furry leather hoods, but the hot air they exhale quickly condenses on their hard mustaches.</p>
<p>The rivers are frozen solid, even a strong hammer blow will only reveal a white line. So, the pleasure-seeking people are doing ice skating, or holding their partners, riding in snow sleds, sliding down the slopes, enjoying the snow scenery everywhere. How happy and peaceful they are!</p>
<p>But! In the world of ice and snow, we can no longer see the heroic anti-Japanese warriors, only the blood-red sun flag on the Great Wall, waving and flaunting its power in the north wind!</p>
<p>The broken rivers and mountains, the incomplete trenches, and the heroes' blood are all covered by white snow—the people whose blood has been chilled by the cold air have, of course, forgotten all the humiliating and tragic stories, and are infatuated with the beautiful snow scenery, and intoxicated by the masquerade ice skating party!</p>
<h3>Talking from Experience</h3>
<p>— Zikang</p>
<p>The time when a woman seems most lovable to us is when she has already said she doesn't love us anymore.</p>
<p>When you are so poor that you don't even have food to eat, you are especially easy to get hungry. It seems like you could eat four or five meals a day, but when you have food to eat, you often find it disgusting.</p>
<p>When you go back to your hometown, you feel that life in your hometown is very boring after only two days, but when you leave your hometown, you will think of the loveliness of your hometown.</p>
<p>Even if the rice you cook yourself is burnt and mushy, it always tastes better than the rice in the restaurant outside.</p>
<p>Short Story</p>
<h3>Wax and Wane</h3>
<p>— Tian Hensheng</p>
<p>After that, the days of returning became more and more distant from Ju Li, returning twice in three years, three and a half years, and six and a half years. After that, there was no news, not knowing where he was drifting. It was only rumored that Ah Quan's wife had died, and that he had remarried to a very young woman. But no one could know his exact situation. That he had more money now could be asserted with certainty, which could be inferred from the clothes and behavior of his three previous returns to his hometown, which were definitely not as poor as they had been fifteen years ago. In this way, everyone who knew Ah Quan, including his relatives, suddenly began to miss Ah Quan as if dying embers had rekindled. Everyone talked about Ah Quan with a sense of eager anticipation to see him; at the same time, they all instinctively thought that Ah Quan must have had a new story, and that he no longer wanted this hometown; from this speculation, it could also be known that Ah Quan would never return; the reason was that a major change had occurred in the Yu family, which everyone expected must have been known to Ah Quan, who did not want to send his daughter into a pit of poverty, which was why there had been no news for five or six years, and that there was no other reason than breaking off the engagement.</p>
<p>This news was indeed surprising. Fifteen years ago, Ah Quan was so poor that he only owned an old boat; now, the Yu family was so poor that they only owned three old houses, with nothing else of value. Mingfa had died of illness three years ago, and now there was only Mingfa's wife and son, Longsheng. Although Longsheng was already twenty-two years old, he was dull and unwilling to study when he was young, and later, because of poverty, he had to learn carpentry, earning very little money.</p>
<p>However, Longsheng felt the need to marry a wife very urgently. The fire of youth burned his entire soul, and the desire for the opposite sex filled his entire consciousness; when others remembered Ah Quan and talked about Ah Quan, he listened silently and imagined his fiancée, Xiaoling. In his imagination, Xiaoling was an extremely beautiful girl; although he had never really met her, in his dreams, he had met her many times, but he only vaguely remembered the face with which she had met him in his dreams.</p>
<p>Longsheng was eager to marry a wife, so he naturally asked his mother. His mother recalled the old story from fifteen years ago when Ah Quan wanted to marry her daughter to raise as a child bride. She regretted that she had not agreed at the time. If she had been a child bride, there would not be no news now, and perhaps she could have relied on Ah Quan's wealth to get some benefit. But regret was useless. For the sake of her son's request, she had to find a matchmaker. But at this time, Jiang Si-ye had also died. Zhu Changchun, who had originally been invited by Mingfa to be a helper matchmaker, did not take on this responsibility, and he also complained that her family had not agreed to the child bride in the first place. Every time she went to see Changchun, she returned home disappointed and powerless.</p>
<p>The extreme burning of the fire of youth caused Longsheng to lose his mind, and he actually thought that his mother was unwilling to find him a wife, and he often made a big fuss over it. The more he made a fuss, the more his mother regretted not agreeing to the child bride in the past, and the more saddened she was by the poverty now, and the more terrified she was of the future. If this continued, they would not become a family! Moreover, the speculation about Ah Quan's wealth gradually became confirmed. Someone met Ah Quan in a big city thousands of miles away, saying that he was much fatter than before and had a good complexion, and that he must have made a fortune. His mother was even more indescribably sad, but Longsheng hurriedly asked the person where he had met Ah Quan.</p>
<p>A few days later, Longsheng suddenly disappeared, his whereabouts unknown.</p>

<h3>Foreign Exchange Still at 7%</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market trend was calmer than before. Because banks are still in the closed period and are not doing business due to holidays, only money shops and a few Chinese-owned banks were open for trading.

<p>There is more demand for the number, and the market price has risen by two, three, to seven or eight jiao, but various 20-year types are relatively flat, but they do not deviate from the state of near high and far low. The relationship is squeezing shorts, thus causing the reason. Only this month, the secondary session squeezing short situation is stuck, the market price fluctuates up and down, mostly short covering after the afternoon opening. Although the market price fluctuates up and down, the number is very small, but it has gradually increased recently. The closing price still has a short squeeze, especially with the layoff of soldiers. The current month rose from 60 yuan and 7 jiao to 61 yuan and 5 jiao, and then fell back to 60 yuan and 5 fen. In the same session, it rose by one yuan due to short covering. It is very cost-effective to apply more short covering. The bulls sacrificed the profit of drawing seals, issued this month, and bought back next month. In a transfer, the market price can be reduced by as much as three yuan. Therefore, the double change from high to low is actually due to the lack of layoff chips, and the need is slightly more, that is, it feels exhausted. As a result, the market price fluctuates up and down, and most of the current month's Zhang are more, such as the layoff of soldiers this month, which rose by one yuan and five jiao, while next month is only half a yuan, and the rest are similar. Today, only one month of futures for January is auctioned, and the market can be relatively stable. The total number of transactions is 2,214,700 yuan, including 2,000 yuan in spot goods, 1,525,000 yuan in futures unified salt tax, 4,840,000 yuan in layoffs, 2,570,000 yuan in 19 customs duties, 3,565,000 yuan in 20 rolls of 20 customs duties, 2,220,000 yuan in gold short and whole six, and the rest are tens of thousands to more than 800,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton</h3>
<p>The yarn market is still flat and tired</p>
<p>The yarn market is still flat and tired, because the environment is bad, and it really needs to be quiet, so people's hearts are softened, but the bottom plate has dried up, and the new selling wind is not strong, but buyers see that the situation is not good, and their actions are also fresh, so the market atmosphere is in a dilemma of advancing and retreating. This month, the multi-head company maintained the purchase of 70 yuan, the decline was curbed, and the market price was slightly fixed.</p>
<p>People's Standard Is Not Prosperous　People's Standard opened in the morning market, because the actual sales were not smooth, and there was a lack of buyers in the market. Each month fell by 2, 3, 4, and 5 jiao. In the afternoon, the market situation was still tired, and each month fell by 1 jiao. The total transaction statistics for the whole day were 10,300 packages. It was found that Dafeng sold 1,100 packages, Da Ji 400 packages, Yuanda 450 packages, Xincheng 850 packages, and Ruida 350 packages. Yuda bought 1,100 packages, Suijiang 500 packages, Xinhua 500 packages, Shen Ji 300 packages, Changfeng 250 packages, and Yuanda 200 packages. The closing prices are as follows:</p>

<p>For two days, the customer gang was very quiet, with more accidents and less activity. The factory slightly released its files, so the market atmosphere was calm and weak. Until the afternoon opening, it was still stable at first. American factories continued to release, and because the end was approaching, the bulls sold off one after another. The market atmosphere gradually belonged to the lower level. Three hours later, it was reported that Japanese merchants in Dalian were selling foreign flour, and the price continued to fall. It was said to be only 2 yuan and 5 fen, and one rumor said it was only 1 yuan and 9 jiao and 8 fen. In this case, it is naturally more difficult to boost people's hearts, and the future of Sanbu flour is feared to be even worse. As a result, this month fell by 2 fen and 7.5 li compared to the previous day, January fell by 3.5 fen, February fell by 3 fen, March fell by 2 fen and 7.5 li, April fell by 2 li and 5 li, and May fell by 3 fen.</p>
<h3>83 Trucks of Wheat Delivered This Month</h3>
<p>—Standard Wheat Market Extremely Quiet—</p>
<p>After the wheat market opened in the morning and afternoon, the market in each month showed a light and quiet state. Because foreign wheat has stopped trading and there is no quotation, there is little foreign meaning in the buying and selling of each month. Moreover, this month has passed, and there are fewer chips. Both long-term parties are watching, so the access is quiet again. As a result, only March was good for one point, and April was one point smaller. As for the standard delivery for this month, it has been fully fulfilled yesterday, with a total of 83 trucks, delivered by numbers 6, 19, 24, 27, and 35, and received by numbers 23 and 36.</p>
<h3>The First Batch of Domestically Produced New Cotton Red Enters the Market in the Sugar Market</h3>
<p>—Opening at 17 Yuan—</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market trend was flat and tired. The association divided the market into 24 rough sand white ordinary divisions at 19 yuan and 6 jiao, with no rise or fall. The transshipment goods were 5 fen, which was 6 yuan and 7 jiao and a half. The 20th medium sand white high goods transshipped at 6 yuan and 7 jiao and a half, the 89th Dutch red transshipped at 7 yuan. Taikoo sugar was stable, still at 20 yuan and 6 jiao. Zhenji's own factory cotton white number one was 1 jiao smaller, at 18 yuan and 5 jiao and a half. Chao Gang number opened a new mention of green at 13 yuan and 7 jiao, also 1 jiao smaller, ordinary 12 yuan and 8 jiao also opened the first batch of new cotton red more than 100 bags, the price was 17 yuan.</p>
<h3>Large Quantities of Quality Indigo Serge Selling Well</h3>
<p>Yesterday, transactions in serge were mostly retail. Quality indigo serge, in particular, was selling briskly. Western tailoring shops and fashionable women's clothing stores are continually purchasing it, mostly for making men's and women's leather overcoats, hence the current strong sales of both Chinese and foreign indigo serge. Fabrics priced around seven yuan are selling especially well. Both local and national capital traders are importing large quantities, and its rapid turnover is currently unmatched by any other woolen fabric. Domestically produced "Zhanghua" brand indigo serge sells for seven and a half yuan, Japanese indigo serge for seven yuan, "Shenchuan Tuo" indigo serge for seven and a half yuan, and "Lihe" for thirteen yuan four jiao.</p>

<h3>From Changing to Deepening</h3>
<p>— Ruoye</p>
<p>Many books on the cultivation of writers often mention the issue of "changing environments."</p>
<p>The meaning of "changing environments," as Shiramura Togyu [TN: Cook River White Village, a Japanese author] said, is to discover "a new self." To put it more plainly, it means that writers should constantly change their living environments, using continuous new life experiences to enrich themselves and their works. Only in this way can the wellspring of creativity not dry up, and the life of creation remain eternally fresh.</p>
<p>Recently, I saw a conversation by Hollywood star and writer Elizabeth Landi. Her main point was, "You can't maintain your youth even if you live in a beauty salon. Your spirit, your thoughts, your entire life plan must have a vibrant spring atmosphere, and then your face can reflect your youth." This is of course talking about how women should maintain their youth. In it, she also explains that "the greatest enemy of human age is monotony in life," and she advocates that life should be constantly "changed," starting with the arrangement of indoor furniture. The meaning is also to advise people to "change environments" to increase the interest in life and to maintain an eternally fresh spirit. This extends the issue of "changing environments" beyond writers to all aspects of life.</p>
<p>Is it really true that simply being able to constantly "change environments" can enrich one's life and keep one's life fresh? I think this is not entirely reliable. Naturally, "changing life" can help writers enrich and refresh the content of their works, and ordinary people can increase their interest in life. However, this does not prove that they have deepened their understanding of life, and that they are developing themselves through a deepened understanding of life. I believe that what is more important is not "changing environments" to obtain a constant surprise in life, but being able to deeply "understand life." To put it together, deepening one's understanding of life is of primary importance, and "changing life" is relatively secondary. If you don't understand life, what is the point of "changing environments" every day?</p>
<p>Do you want to enrich your life and your works? If possible, you can often "change environments," but you must first deepen your own understanding of life, I add in this way.</p>
<h3>New Feelings About Old Things</h3>
<p>— Xu Maoyong</p>
<p>The world's largest Bible, and the fourth-century Codex Sinaiticus, is indeed a precious antiquity. But Russia, which had such an antiquity, did not know how to cherish it, and instead gave it to the British Museum, and used the price of 100,000 pounds to buy machinery from England.</p>
<p>This will make people think of the XXXXX and Mr. X's corruption case in our country, and what I think of is another matter that is also somewhat related to Mr. X.</p>
<p>A few years ago, China had a school that required students to study and work at the same time. I was once a student there. One year, our class was assigned to practice in a metalworking shop. However, for a long time, we could not get work. At that time, the world economic panic had not yet occurred, and our factory was not related to the market at all, and would not be affected by foreign influences. The reason why we had no work was simply because the school could not receive funding and could not afford raw materials. However, it is really ridiculous to say that, for example, in the metalworking shop, we did not really work, but just played around, so we did not need a lot of iron as raw material. According to estimates, the school authorities only needed to spend fifty yuan per month to cover our consumption. However, it is said that they really could not even come up with fifty yuan.</p>
<p>But once, we discovered a strange thing. In the workshop, there were actually many workers smashing large machines one by one. A truck was waiting outside the workshop to transport the goods. We asked the workers and learned that it was the idea of the workshop director to sell these machines to another factory as scrap iron. This made us very angry. Selling good machines as scrap iron, having so much scrap iron to sell without distributing a little to us as raw material, and we also knew that this was the director's personal idea, without the approval of the school affairs meeting. Based on these three points, we determined that the director had committed a major crime, so we issued declarations, sent telegrams, and accused the director to all the faculty, staff, and students of the school and to the president in Nanjing.</p>
<p>The president was also furious when he heard the news, so he specially sent a committee to the school to investigate. The investigation meeting was held in the president's office. In addition to the committee members, the secretary-general, representatives of the faculty and staff, representatives of the student union, our representatives as plaintiffs, the accused director, and an industrial expert were also present. In the two-hour debate, the defendant finally ran out of arguments, and the various cover-up methods he had set up were also broken one by one by the plaintiffs. When the truth was about to be revealed, the industrial expert suddenly stood up and said that the workshop director was indeed lacking in procedures, but there was no crime of destroying machines. As an expert, he dared to conclude that those machines were really useless and equivalent to scrap iron.</p>
<p>This case ended like this. Both the plaintiff and the defendant were innocent. Because from the committee members to us, none of us were industrial experts, and we could not refute the expert's words, even though we clearly saw these machines were still able to produce two months ago.</p>
<p>From then on, I finally understood the organization of the behind-the-scenes and the wonderful use of experts, and I also understood a kind of great sophistication by analogy.</p>
<p>Smashing good machines and selling them as scrap iron is different from exchanging useless X things for expensive machines. This is the difference between a declining old family and a newly rich household, and also the difference between China and Russia today.</p>
<h3>Geography Class</h3>
<p>— Li Huiying</p>
<p>The teacher stood on the platform, opened a map of the Republic of China made in the twenty-first year of the Republic (1932), hung it next to the blackboard, and pointed out the borders of "Manchukuo" to the students. As the pointer moved on the map, he explained:</p>
<p>"Look, from here, to here, then a turn, to here, to here, then back to here, this is the border of 'Manchukuo'."</p>
<p>He started from Shanhaiguan, pointing along the coast, then to the Yalu River, the Tumen River, then up to the Ussuri River, the Heilong River, down to the Ergun River, the border of Mongolia, Chahar all the way to the Great Wall, and back to the original position of Shanhaiguan.</p>
<p>"Have you seen it clearly? Do you understand? This is the border of 'Manchukuo'."</p>
<p>He asked the thirty-odd elementary school students below the stage, unexpectedly, more than half of the small hands in the seats were raised. According to the seating arrangement, he was going to ask the students about their doubts.</p>
<p>"Hu Nanshan, what don't you understand?"</p>
<p>Hu Nanshan sat in the first row and stood up, saying in a grand manner:</p>
<p>"Teacher, this is a map of the Republic of China, how come there is a 'Manchukuo'?"</p>
<p>He did not answer immediately, intending to ask all the students who raised their hands, and then answer together. He told Hu Nanshan to sit down and asked other students.</p>
<p>"Didn't the teacher say last year that the three northeastern provinces are Chinese territory?"</p>
<p>"Teacher, does Jehol also belong to 'Manchukuo'? Wasn't it also part of China before?"</p>
<p>"If 'Manchukuo' is not China, then we are not Chinese either!"</p>
<p>After asking all the students who raised their hands, they all asked the same kind of questions.</p>
<p>He was stumped.</p>
<p>Logically, he also knew about this matter; how "Manchukuo" was established, how "Manchukuo" came to possess Chinese land, and who created "Manchukuo". However, he couldn't say it directly. If he did, he would not want his life anymore - the Japanese would definitely arrest him and behead him.</p>
<p>But this aroused his infinite sadness, for himself, for these elementary school students, he felt that there were more people who were slaves to the Japanese Empire under the name of "Manchukuo" and could never turn over.</p>
<p>He stood blankly on the platform, and two huge hot tears unexpectedly welled up in his eyes.</p>
<p>"'Manchukuo' - is - newly established, - is - separated from - China."</p>
<p>After a while, he could only say this stutteringly, perfunctorily answering the students' questions. He thought that after saying this, he would bear the pain and rush through the lesson, but this still did not satisfy the students' desire for answers. In their young minds, they immediately recalled the traces of the riots in cities and villages after the September 18th Incident (Mukden Incident). They also knew somewhat that the Japanese created "Manchukuo" and separated a large piece of land from the Chinese map, so they changed the topic and asked:</p>
<p>"Teacher, how was 'Manchukuo' established?"</p>
<p>"Teacher, teacher, who separated 'Manchukuo' from China?"</p>
<p>He wanted to get rid of the students' encirclement, but not only was it impossible, but the students became even more eager to pester him. Now the questions asked by the students were even more serious and practical. Because of his own difficult situation, he suddenly thought of Daudet's "The Last Lesson". Compared to that, he and the students below the stage were even more unfortunate than the characters in that novel. That old teacher could still inject a final stimulant into the students, but he didn't dare to say even half a word about the bad things about the Japanese.</p>
<p>What to do? If a teacher cannot satisfy the students' desires, then the students will despise him, especially some elementary school students, who use the teacher's ability to answer questions as a condition for judging whether the teacher is good or bad.</p>
<p>"'Manchukuo' was created by Japanese imperialism - " He was about to answer the students truthfully, regardless of everything, but coincidentally, the bell rang to end the class, which was undoubtedly a benefactor who rescued him from his predicament. He hurriedly packed up the map, not even having the courage to glance at the students below the stage, and casually said, "Class dismissed, let's talk about it next time," and hurriedly left the classroom.</p>
<h3>Two Brothers (71)</h3>
<p>— By Maupassant, Translated by Li Weike</p>
<p>"Let me speak… Listen… I have many things to say to you, to make you understand… But you won't understand… Because… if you want me to stay… then it must be… no, I can't…"</p>
<p>"Speak, Mother, speak."</p>
<p>"Alright! I'll speak. At least I didn't deceive you… You want me to stay with you, don't you? For this reason, so that we can still see each other, still talk, still bump into each other in the same room all day long—because I'm afraid to open the door now, fearing that I'll see your brother behind that door—for this reason, don't forgive me—nothing is more unbearable than forgiveness—but don't feel angry at all about what I did before… You need to feel very strong, feel different from others, so that you can think that you are not Roland's son without blushing, without despising me… I've suffered enough… I've suffered too much, I can't suffer anymore, no, I can't suffer anymore! And my suffering didn't start yesterday, it's been a long time… But you won't understand this, you! So that we can still live together, still hug each other, my little Zhe'an, you can well imagine that although I was your father's mistress, I was actually more like his wife, his true wife. I feel no shame at all about this. I regret nothing. He's dead now and I still love him. I will always love him. I've only loved him. He was my whole life, all my happiness, all my hope, all my comfort, my everything. For such a long time, he was my everything! Listen to me, my little darling, I can say before God that if I hadn't met him, there would be no interest in my life, nothing, no affection, no tenderness, none of that which makes us feel very regretful about the time we grow old, nothing! Everything I have was given to me by him! In this world, I only had him, followed by you two, your brother and you. Without you, my life would be empty, as dark and empty as night. If I hadn't met him, then I wouldn't have loved anything, wouldn't have known anything, wouldn't have hoped for anything, wouldn't even have cried.—Because I have cried, my little Zhe'an. Ah! Yes, I have cried, ever since we came here. I gave him my whole self, body and soul, permanently, happily, and I can declare before the God who paired us together that for more than ten years, I was his wife just as he was my husband. Later, I knew that he didn't love me as passionately as before. He was always kind and attentive, but I wasn't the same in his eyes as before. That was the end! Ah! How I cried!… Life is so base and cunning!… Nothing lasts… So we moved here; and I never saw him again. He never came… He always said in his letters that he would come… I kept waiting for him!… And I never saw him again… And now he's dead… But since he thought of you, then he must still love us. As for me, I will still love him when I take my last breath. I will never deny that I love him, and I love you because you are his son. I can't feel ashamed in front of you because of him! Do you understand? I can't! If you want me to stay, then you must agree to be his son, and we must talk about him from time to time. You must love him a little, and we must think of him when we look at each other. If you don't want to, if you can't, then goodbye forever, my little darling. We can't stay together now! Whatever you want me to do, I will do."</p>
<p>Zhe'an replied in a gentle voice:</p>
<p>"Stay, Mother."</p>

<h3>Official Addiction and Official Famine</h3>
<p>— Lizhai</p>
<p>This year, the civil service examinations held separately in Beijing and Ping (Peiping, present-day Beijing) officially recruited more than eight hundred people, and those who failed were around two thousand. This phenomenon not only illustrates the difficulty of finding an outlet for Chinese intellectuals, but also shows that the number of Chinese citizens who want to be officials is still higher than that of any other profession.</p>
<p>Secondly, whenever the North China Political Affairs Readjustment Council is established, or the Hubei, Jiangsu, or a certain provincial government is reorganized, those newly appointed dignitaries invariably post notices to fend off requests, saying "willing to recruit, but unable to place" (meaning they have too many recommendations and not enough positions). But in fact, each new dignitary receives thousands of letters of recommendation, at least eight hundred. Also, the hotels in the central and provincial capitals and commercial ports, whenever a ministry or provincial government is reorganized, are usually fully booked. Nine out of ten of these travelers with a bag and a belly full of hope come from afar to "look for work" (a "modern" way of saying "to become an official"). All these facts, on the one hand, reflect the depth of people's "official addiction," which is still "unshakeable" despite "revolution," and on the other hand, show that in this era, there are more people seeking "officialdom" than before, resulting in an "official famine" due to oversupply. The seriousness of the "official famine" problem for the national economy and the people's livelihood is no less than that of rural bankruptcy!</p>
<p>Why is "official addiction" more deeply ingrained in people than "ideological belief," something they never forget? Because: from the perspective of those who want to be "officials," they have clearly been inspired by the fact that nine out of ten of the "officials" who were previously appointed to positions have made a fortune, and they understand that the gains from being an "official" are actually greater than those from any other occupation, whether scholar, farmer, worker, or merchant. Secondly, from the perspective of the general public towards those who are "officials," they are still mostly admired and envied, just like Su Ji's sister-in-law's view - "because my husband's position is high and he has a lot of money"?</p>
<p>Why has the phenomenon of "official famine" become so widespread and serious? Because: first, everyone wants to be an official, so naturally there are too many monks and not enough porridge, resulting in the phenomenon of monks scrambling around because they can't get rice. Second, the common practice of government in China is not to find people because of the job, but to assign jobs because of the people. The occupation of administrative "officials" has no guarantee, and their fate depends on the arrival and departure of political "officials." Since the rise and fall of the boss is "full of illusions in the official career," the assistants naturally have the panic of "packing up and leaving" at any time.</p>
<p>The result of the "official famine" deepening day by day is naturally "disaster officials" all over China!</p>
<p>Where do "disaster officials" go? This depends on the rank of the "disaster official." Small "disaster officials" do not suffer so much because their "official status" or "official face" is not very important, so they may as well change their profession and re-enter the ranks of scholars, farmers, workers, and merchants, or even pull rickshaws. However, there are also those who have no other skills besides being "officials" or whose "official addiction" is too deep and who cannot point the way out when hungry. Therefore, we often see news of "disaster officials" "dying for their cause." The most serious problem is the "big disaster officials" above the rank of senior official. Most of them are "anxious and uneasy without an official for three days"! However, it is easy to step down, but it is most difficult to step up. They have no choice but to find a way out when there is no way out. As a result, these "big disaster officials" become politicians who "fear that the world will not be in chaos." The first question these people think about in their hearts and say in their mouths is "will there be changes in the political situation"? Because only with "change" can new people who play with guns and cannons come out to "obey heaven and respond to the people," which will inevitably break the rice bowls of a group of current "officials" and turn them into "disaster officials." And these "old disaster officials" who hope for "change" have endless opportunities to escape "disaster," get rid of their predicament, and jump onto the stage.</p>
<p>Afterwards, like a revolving lantern, it is the turn of the newly dismissed "disaster officials" (most of whom are full and not really "disaster," but still do not want to be neglected) to hope for "changes in the political situation" or create "changes in the political situation."</p>
<p>"If poor, then change." Changes follow changes, and the "Great China Stage" that bears the brunt of these "changes" is unimaginable!</p>

<h3>Talking about the National Products Year</h3>
<p>— Xiaosheng</p>
<p>Last year, I was a minor assistant in a XXX National Products Promotion Association, burying my head in writing all day long. What I wrote was always nothing more than saying that foreign goods are imported by several hundred million yuan every year, and our country is now at a critical juncture of life and death. If the people of the country do not wake up again, the country will soon perish. The following is to promote how good the current national products are, and how they are better than imported goods. However, for our panicked national psyche, using the idea of national demise or not as a strong stimulant is not the best approach. Anyway, they believe that Shanghai, which has been under the rule of foreign powers for decades, is a place where people live and work in peace and contentment, and has never experienced a panic. Only the miserable friends in the mainland flee back and forth when they encounter natural disasters and man-made calamities. Although the news of the January 28th Incident was reported in the newspapers as something shocking, in fact, those living in the concessions were still at peace. Although dozens of planes were buzzing overhead, as if watching the movie "The Aviation World," the unlucky ones were only the Zhabei area in the Chinese part of the city, which became a scorched earth. Therefore, it is better to be ruthless and turn the whole country into concessions like Shanghai. Wouldn't that be a world of favorable weather and prosperity? Therefore, many compatriots, hearing the propaganda of national products and the country's demise, instead wanted to bring up their great feelings of lifting a stone and pressing their own feet.</p>
<p>I remember that just today last year, I was concentrating on writing big advertisements for the National Products Year, preparing for the National Products Year motorcade parade on New Year's Day, fully expecting that with the sound of firecrackers bidding farewell to the old and welcoming the new, under the tune of universal renewal, national products would eventually spread like wildfire and sell well throughout the country. Under the national spirit of my Chinese descendants, foreign goods would naturally disappear. Although this was just my wishful thinking, everyone believed that this year's imports of foreign goods would be at least discounted compared to previous years. However, the National Products Year has passed from the beginning to the end of the year. According to the figures reported by the International Trade Bureau to the government, the trade deficit was written unceremoniously as more than 474 million yuan, and it is estimated that the figure of 900 million yuan will be reached by the end of the year, which is the highest record of trade deficit in previous years. It is simply an unprecedented trade deficit phenomenon since the opening of trade. It is unknown whether this is enough to show the people's material progress and the so-called "Chinese people are rich in commercial ethics" by a certain important British figure?</p>
<p>I heard that next year, the Republic of China's 23rd year (1934), will be changed to the Women's National Products Year. Today's newspapers already have several groups coming forward to initiate it, and they are busy applying to the government for registration. They will also hold a large-scale motorcade parade on New Year's Day next year. Talking about the results of this year's National Products Year is like pouring a basin of cold water. Probably in the eyes of the gentlemen who are persevering and enthusiastic in promoting national products, they think that this year's unexpected and chilling results are all due to the women's lack of help. Therefore, as long as women use less powder and wear less imported silk, they will definitely succeed. But what exactly? Nothing has started yet, so there is no result to talk about. I have not studied fortune-telling, let alone predict, so I have to wait until later.</p>
<p>But I must say this: Is the demise or survival of a country entirely determined by whether the people use national products or not? This is indeed a problem. But because of the length of the intention, it can only be put aside for now. Now, let's take a hundred or a thousand steps back: If our country's market can cut off foreign goods, then I think even the ladies, mistresses, and officials who have always liked to buy foreign goods, would not die on empty foreign goods boxes, would they? On the other hand, the farmers work hard to cultivate the land for a year, and after paying all the taxes and land taxes, what is left is not enough for the cost of land fertilizer. The workers work hard all day and are not enough to feed themselves. Under this whip of life, they will naturally choose the cheaper ones for daily necessities. Where do they have the gentlemanly care to distinguish whether this is a national product or that is a foreign product? This is a matter of human nature, the same mind, the same reason.</p>
<p>The Women's National Products Year is about to begin, and our hope, of course, is that we can get a good result. But if it still happens to be on par with this year (this is just in case, not schadenfreude, I hereby declare), then in the 24th year of the National Products Year, I will be the first to advocate that it should be changed to the "Military National Products Year." The endless civil wars that have occurred over the years have done millions upon millions of business with foreign countries. If the warlord masters of the whole country can change to using national products because of the National Products Year, and further because there are no national products, everyone does not use them, then at that time, it will not be impossible to prevent foreign goods from entering our country's market, and national products can be promoted without having to be advocated.</p>
<p>Although this is a pile of nonsense, I think it is at least the wish of hundreds of millions of ordinary people!</p>
<h3>One Time, Another Time</h3>
<p>— Where to Go</p>
<p>When a person is sick, they always think this way: What if I get well right away? Then I can do things that I can't do, I can do things that are difficult to do, and I can even do things that I don't like to do. But once a person gets better, although the words are still remembered, and the ability to do things is still the same, the heart has changed in every way. I always feel that this is "one time, another time." The previous words seem to be said only in the previous environment.</p>
<p>The same is true for the generally frustrated people. They always think that one day they will be successful, their temperament will be more generous, money will often be lent, they will always be more polite to others, and cars will never run over poor people on the road. When they are really successful, things are quite different. Generosity has turned into stinginess, money is tightly held in the purse, and the attitude towards others is cold, as if wanting to eat them. The words said before, even if remembered, will be explained with various reasons. What generosity is foolish, saving is necessary, being polite to others is not allowed, driving a car slowly will delay things and waste fuel, etc., the words are like flowing water, said without a bit of thought.</p>
<p>What kind of argument is this? Think about it, it seems very mysterious. In fact, if you think about it carefully, it is just two sides of human nature. One side is prepared for fantasy, and the other side is prepared for reality. Because it is always rare for a person to want to be successful and be successful. If one is not successful, one cannot help but fantasize, and once one fantasizes, it seems that one will not be blessed by the gods if one does not become a good person; it is as if entering a temple and making a vow will not get the blessing of the gods. When one is successful, one can naturally ignore these things. As long as one ascends to the throne, the previous words, even if recognized as nonsense, recognized as bullshit, are up to him!</p>
<h3>The Editor of the Supplement</h3>
<p>— Wang Ci</p>
<p>"Of all the strange flavors in the world, none is worse than the suffering of the supplement editor!"</p>
<p>This sentence is neither "said by the ancients" nor "XX maxim": it is experience that tells me to fabricate it.</p>
<p>So, what is the suffering exactly? Well, let me tell you!</p>
<p>Too many manuscripts are submitted, but the space of the supplement is only so large. Looking at the submissions, they are all "masterpieces" crafted with painstaking effort. If I publish this one, I inevitably have to give up that one; therefore, I hesitate and feel the suffering in my heart; this is the first suffering!</p>
<p>Too few manuscripts are submitted. I piece them together from here and there, but it is still not enough. I flip through the old manuscripts, but they have all lost their timeliness. I have to fill in the blanks myself, so I borrow the power of cigarettes in the hope of "composing a poem in seven steps" and "writing thousands of words at a stroke"; unexpectedly, desire and reality often become the opposite: the more I force myself, the slower it becomes! I stare at the manuscript paper, feeling at a loss and achieving nothing! I feel the suffering in my heart; this is the second suffering!</p>
<p>Manuscripts are sent by relatives and friends, and there are often those that have no value for publication; however, he is my brother-in-law! He is my classmate! He is my acquaintance! He is my student! If I publish them, I am afraid of losing my "newspaper style"; if I abandon them, I am afraid of losing my "friendship". I think back and forth, and there is no suitable solution! I feel the suffering in my heart; this is the third suffering!</p>
<p>There are some contributors who have a very large output; they even send a manuscript every day, but there are very few good ones. Although I don't publish them, I can't frustrate their perseverance in submitting manuscripts. Their works are indeed not good, but their spirit is truly commendable! In the end, I abandon them without publishing them, and my heart is always uneasy; this is the fourth suffering!</p>
<p>If I am not careful in selecting manuscripts, I can easily be caught by critics who are good at "nitpicking," and scolded. Although I endure and swallow my anger, and imitate Ah Q's spiritual victory method, I am still somewhat disappointed; this is the fifth suffering!</p>
<p>Or a few sentences are added to the manuscript, saying that my family cannot afford to pay for school, and I rely entirely on the fees from this submission to maintain my studies, or saying that there is an economic panic, and please publish more to maintain my livelihood. How can such a pitiful attitude not move people's hearts? This is the sixth suffering!</p>
<p>Or when writing filler material, I am too arbitrary, and unintentionally offend the authorities, resulting in reprimands, warnings, and... Therefore, I always have a warning in my heart when I write, and my heart is uneasy; this is the seventh suffering!</p>
<p>The suffering of supplement editors is numerous! How can there be only "seven sufferings"!</p>
<h3>Back Room Drama</h3>
<p>— Lingling</p>
<p>Another sleepless night to curse; the clock has already struck two. I'm still tossing and turning on a makeshift wooden bed in a cramped back room, unable to sleep. I don't know if it's because the weather has gotten colder lately and the comforter is too thin, or if the neurasthenia I've been free of for over a year has relapsed. I'm truly worried about myself. I've tried repeatedly to calm down and banish all thoughts, but the more I try to calm down, the more flustered I become, and the less I can sleep.</p>
<p>After some time, the back door downstairs creaked open, followed by the sounds of conversation, footsteps on the stairs, and coughs, shattering the quiet and cold of the late night. I knew it was my landlord and his wife returning. The front room door opened, then the lights were switched on, the wardrobe opened, conversations and whispers were exchanged, the thermos was opened, water was poured, and there was the soft, emotional laughter of a woman... Suddenly, the air became much livelier. But this sudden change in the atmosphere made my mind feel hazy, and I had a floating sensation.</p>
<p>"You son of a bitch, you dare play around again; give it back, you dare not give it back!" Before I had even fallen asleep, a sharp, fierce scream came from the front room through the cracks in the wall, waking me from the hazy dreamland I had just entered. I was shocked, stretched my head out further, and strained my ears to listen.</p>
<p>"Tell me! Who did you steal it to give to? You black-hearted bastard, you son of a bitch! Give it back, give it back!" It was still the woman's voice, with a crying and scolding tone.</p>
<p>The man didn't respond; the woman started sobbing, muttering through gritted teeth, "You son of a bitch, you black-hearted devil."</p>
<p>Perhaps the woman's scolding was too intense, enraging the man: "Damn it!" A thunderous roar shook the thin walls, "So what? I took it, I gave it to the one I love, what are you going to do about it? Scold? You scold again, and I'll beat you!"</p>
<p>"You son of a bitch, you black-hearted devil! Stealing my things to please some rotten whore, not admitting your mistake, and you still want to hit me? Hmph, go ahead and hit me, I dare you to hit me." The woman didn't soften in the face of the threat.</p>
<p>"I'll hit you, I'll just hit you!" *Slap, slap*, the sound of a palm connecting with a fleshy face, crisp and loud. She was rolling on the floor, her heels drumming against the floorboards, screaming shrilly, mixed with the sound of phlegm and snot; she wasn't begging for mercy, but she wasn't as tough as before either: "Okay, hit me, I'll let you beat me to death, if you don't beat me to death tonight, you're not a man! Beat me to death, so you, you son of a bitch, can bring that slut and rotten whore into the house to have fun... Hit me, hit me hard... Hit me,... Help, murder!..."</p>
<p>The man silently and mercilessly rained blows on the body rolling on the floor, the woman continued to cry out loudly: at first, she mixed it with harsh scolding, but later she cried more and more mournfully, "Help! Murder!"</p>
<p>This continued for another ten minutes or so. By this time, the sister-in-law in the attic room, Mr. and Mrs. Wang in the front parlor downstairs, Mr. Zhang in the back parlor, and the maid, Little Sheng, and her old, trembling-lipped nanny in the kitchen, I don't believe that these tenants could still be comfortably seeking their own sweet dreams in their beds: logically, I also don't believe that the tragic cries for "help" wouldn't strike their hearts and have some impact. However, despite the shouting, every room remained silent; although I had only moved in a week ago, I was used to this kind of thing, and I knew there was definitely no danger to life, so I felt annoyed, buried my head in the comforter, and plugged my ears with my fingers.</p>
<p>But the commotion in the front room intensified, tables, chairs, and the bed were moved from their original positions, teacups and washbasins rolled on the floor with their mistress, something struck the window, and shards of glass fell into the courtyard... the man shouted "Hit!" the woman cried "Help!"...</p>
<p>Suddenly, the man dragged the woman out into the corridor, the sound of blows raining down right next to my bed; things had probably gotten serious, and it seemed that only a third party could intervene to stop it. The sister-in-law in the attic room, under this urgent need, stepped forward righteously, but she only stood at her doorway, saying:</p>
<p>"You're husband and wife, you were fine during the day, what's so important that you have to fight in the middle of the night, it's really not worth it, is it?"</p>
<p>There was no response, the beating continued; so she walked up, dragging the woman back into the room as she said:</p>
<p>"Oh dear, what a sin, in this cold weather, wearing only a thin shirt and sleeping on the ground, what if you get frostbite? Husband and wife should talk things over, why make such a fuss... Mr. Lin, give her a break, look, you've already swollen her head... Mrs. Lin, rest, we can talk about it tomorrow."</p>
<p>"Sister-in-law in the attic room, you don't understand, this shrew is really a cheapskate, you can't give in to her, I wouldn't be satisfied even if I beat her to death tonight." The man's words were obviously rushed.</p>
<p>But the woman, seeing that someone had come and was defending her and blaming the man, no longer just cried out for help, she said in a sobbing voice: "Okay, hit me again, sister-in-law in the Hengzi room, he stole my bracelet to give to a whore, and he's still acting violently! Okay, watch this short-lived ghost beat me to death... I've suffered enough, I'm willing to be beaten to death by you... Hit me... If you don't beat me to death tonight, you're not a good man!"</p>
<p>The man didn't answer, seeming to move to hit her again, but the sister-in-law in the Hengzi room held him back, "Mr. Lin, listen to me, don't fight at night, whatever it is, we'll talk about it tomorrow, we can only do so much as cohabitants, if you keep fighting, and someone dies, there's nothing we can do."</p>
<p>The man stopped, and the woman obediently stopped crying. The sister-in-law in the Hengzi room triumphantly walked back to her Hengzi room. Here, in the front room, the man seemed to go to bed first, and the woman was still sitting at the table, sobbing. Soon, the sound of the light switch being turned off could be heard.</p>
<p>The air was unexpectedly quiet again, but this silence after the great commotion was a major threat to me! I more calmly covered my head with the thin comforter, but my mind was unusually clear because my body felt numbly cold, and my heart was even more flustered and nervous. No matter what, I couldn't allow myself to enter that floating state again.</p>
<p>But the tired man and woman in the front room were responding, sometimes with a mixture of snores, loudly transmitting from the cracks in the wall to the back room.</p>

<h3>Not Allowed to Overstep</h3>
<p>Editor Sir:</p>
<p>I have a friend who works as a laborer at a film company; last August, he returned to his hometown to get married. This marriage was arranged by his parents, with a matchmaker's word, and it has been a year and a half. Because one was in the hometown and one was in Shanghai, there were many inconveniences, so he brought his wife to Shanghai. Coincidentally, I have a three-story apartment, which I couldn't refuse to lend to them. Unexpectedly, the two of them fight and quarrel every day. It's also unbearable that I can't sleep. Also, his wife is very vain. One night, I accidentally heard his wife scolding, "Others are wearing Western suits, and I married you, a poor wretch who doesn't even have a Western suit." My friend replied, "After I die, you can marry a friend who wears Western suits, as you please, but while I'm alive here, I won't allow it." Poor friend of mine, after saying these few words, she bit his thigh until it was covered in blood, and he couldn't even run away. He's a laborer, and he needs to move around all day. How can he endure this situation for long? There's really no way. Please advise me on three things:</p>
<p>(1) Should he divorce her in the shortest possible time? Or what?</p>
<p>(2) My friend is a laborer, illiterate, and naturally unqualified to wear a Western suit. What should he do?</p>
<p>(3) Second landlords in Shanghai have the right to freedom. If I don't allow them to live there, will it harm my friendship with my friend? I hope for a response in your esteemed publication, and I would be extremely grateful. Respectfully,</p>
<p>Zhang Gaoshou</p>
<p>Editor's Note: Mr. Zhang's first question cannot be established, even if it comes from his friend voluntarily; a minor injury caused by marital discord cannot be a condition for divorce. If your friend has no motivation for divorce himself, then Mr. Zhang absolutely cannot overstep or satirically implement it. Under this system of transactional marriage, it is not easy for a laborer to marry a wife. If you advise him to divorce, he will most likely regret it. To deal with this unreasonable wife, you can only use some husband's rights, as long as you don't intend to abuse her. When she lays hands on you, it wouldn't be wrong to give her a few back. In today's Chinese middle and lower classes, this method is very common; and the results are not bad. Marital love is not severed because of it. In the event that your friend is truly weak and incompetent, you, as bystanders, can only go as far as providing support and intimidation, and cannot go any further.</p>
<p>The second question, then of course there is no reason to cater to her.</p>
<p>The third question, endure as much as you can to preserve friendship; when it becomes unbearable, you can only state your difficulties and ask him to move out. Your friend will naturally realize his mistake and will not complain to you.</p>

<h3>Shanghai (28)</h3>
<p>— Zhang Laosan</p>
<p>(Forty-One) Let's Hope So</p>
<p>Little Huang was especially excited today, rushing in and out all day, too busy to cope. He would grab someone and talk for only a few words, as if there was some important event, and then talk to someone else, but what he said was all irrelevant. Suddenly, he thought of going for a walk, and without my agreement, he forced me to run outside. The cold wind outside was blowing hard, and the small trees on the roadside were swaying as if they couldn't bear the pressure and were about to droop. There were so few people on Avenue Joffre, and even those who passed by had their heads buried in their coat collars, hurrying along. The usually straight-lined foreign girls and the foreign gentlemen in stylish Western suits were no longer leisurely strolling on the sidewalks, and the White Russian descendants who catered to the sailors were no longer flashing their seductive eyes. Trams passed by, followed by cars, and the sound seemed even more desolate now. We lowered our heads, counting our steps as we slowly walked, not saying a word, looking like two homeless wanderers.</p>
<p>In the display windows on both sides of the road, the Christmas decorations had lost their effect under the bright lights. Santa Claus, carrying all kinds of gifts, stood alone in the cotton-made snow scene, so lonely. He was unable to grab the attention of passers-by, and after a few days of sorrow, he would be replaced by other beautiful decorations. The time to welcome him once a year was so lively, but after only a few days, he had been abandoned by the people who had welcomed him.</p>
<p>I reached into my pocket and fiddled with a few copper coins, not even understanding why I was idly pondering these facts. I casually pulled out a pack of cigarettes, offered one to Little Huang, and we both stopped at the same time, our heads huddled together, trying to resist the invasion of the cold wind and light a fire.</p>
<p>"Mister" an accented English voice and a dark shadow blocked our path.</p>
<p>I looked up and saw a descendant of a White Russian aristocratic family, wearing a worn Western suit, no coat, no tie, shrugging his shoulders, raising his hand towards us, looking poor and pleading.</p>
<p>"Sorry" I patted my pocket, I pulled out a cigarette and gave it to him "Smoking?"</p>
<p>"Thank You"! He took the cigarette, quickly took out a lighter and lit it, so naturally, letting me inhale the smoke. He retreated to the front of a Russian restaurant, raising his shoulders even higher, almost obscuring his head.</p>
<p>We continued to walk forward, seeing a cloud of thick smoke coming out of his invisible collar, one after another, continuously.</p>
<p>"Pitiable"! I said.</p>
<p>"When we get to that point, I wonder if there will be a gentleman patting his pocket to donate a cigarette?"</p>
<p>"Little Huang, you seem to have lost your senses today."</p>
<p>"Really. Our lives are too insecure. These days, the situation in Shanghai is full of rumors. One day, when the imperialist artillery invades Zhabei, we..." He stopped, seeming unable to find the appropriate words.</p>
<p>"Since the Wan case," I said, "the imperial ambitions have been completely exposed, and the Shenyang Night incident was even more arrogant of the royal military, but... Shanghai, I think, won't go that far..."</p>
<p>"Let's hope so."</p>

<h3>The Glitter of Hollywood</h3>
<p>— Fu</p>
<p>Unfortunately, all hidden in the vault and cannot be taken out</p>
<p>Experts estimate the total value at around twenty million</p>
<p>Everyone knows the extravagance and wastefulness of Hollywood stars, so in their pursuit of luxury and pleasure, they naturally cannot be without shiny things to adorn various parts of their bodies. The most valuable of these shiny things is of course diamonds, followed by various gems and pearls. Silver and gold are countless. But do you know how many diamonds and jewels these Hollywood stars have? According to an estimate by a large jeweler in Los Angeles, Hollywood's investment in jewelry totals as much as US$15 million. Another Hollywood jeweler said that all the jewelry in Hollywood, when added up, is worth about US$20 million. These two jewelers are major suppliers of jewelry to Hollywood. Their business investigations are of course very reliable.</p>
<p>But it's very sad that even with perfect pearl necklaces, large diamond bracelets, rings, etc., they cannot be worn, but must be locked in large steel vaults in large banks. When they have time, they run to the bank, open their own jewelry box, play with it for a while, then carefully put it back, lock it, and come out empty-handed. This is like loving children, raising them in the hospital, rarely seeing them, and being reluctant to part with them. But Hollywood, which is full of jewelry, is ultimately inappropriate, and many people have been robbed before. The most famous times were the misfortunes of Zeppo Marx, Mae West, Maureen O'Sullivan, and Bette Davis. Therefore, they are all afraid to show their real jewelry to the public.</p>
<p>The only exception is Lupe Velez. She is the protagonist of "Pagan Paradise," a famous Mexican cat, a bold and sassy woman. She is not afraid of robbers. She even carries a handgun on her body, ready to resist robbers. She also has a bodyguard, who is Johnny Weissmuller, the Tarzan in "Tarzan the Ape Man," who is also her lover. Their marriage has been rumored for a long time.</p>
<p>When it comes to the richest collection among Hollywood stars, everyone says it is Marion Davies. Experts estimate that it is between US$250,000 and US$500,000. In this year of economic depression, everyone is poor, but Marion Davies is still able to take out money to buy jewelry. Recently, she bought an emerald bracelet and a similar brooch from a New York jeweler, for a total price of around US$40,000. Although Marion Davies' collection is so rich, she doesn't dare to wear it herself, except at very small private gatherings. She used to be very casual, often wearing a large gem on a silver fox coat and hanging it in the dressing room of a large theater. Once, while she was filming a movie, she casually stuffed a large brooch on her chest into a reporter's pocket and then forgot about it. Later, when the reporter returned home, his wife searched his pocket and found the gem-diamond-encrusted brooch, and had a big fight with him. Later, he fortunately remembered Marion Davies and rushed to return it to her. Marion was still indifferent, but in fact, the brooch was worth US$15,000.</p>
<p>Another romantic star, Peggy Hopkins Joyce, may have a collection even larger than Marion Davies'. But she herself says that she doesn't dare to bring her things to Hollywood. Most of her collection is stored in bank vaults in Chicago. Some are stored in Paris. The most famous Joyce diamond was originally owned by an Indian prince, weighing one hundred and fifty carats and worth more than US$500,000. There is also a string of pearls that she bought in Europe, but she stores it in Paris. It is said that because the import tax on the string of pearls would be US$80,000, she said she couldn't afford it! Joyce has been divorced many times. These many things were all bought for her by several ex-husbands, but it is too sad that she doesn't dare to wear them. She also doesn't want to wear fake things, saying that they are not real and there is no interest in wearing them.</p>
<p>Speaking of those who became rich through divorce, there is also Kay Francis. She also has two treasures, an emerald ring and a large diamond. Both are souvenirs from her two ex-husbands. These two things are now also stored in a bank in New York, and she doesn't dare to bring them to Hollywood. In addition to Marion Davies, the Talmadge sisters are also considered wealthy. The other stars, like Joan Crawford and Carole Lombard, also have very valuable things, but they are all stored in banks and cannot be revealed. The rest need not be said.</p>
<p>Film Reviews</p>
<h3>Review of "Brothers' Blood"</h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>— Produced by Anwen Company, premiered at the Beijing Theater —</p>
<p>If we acknowledge that Chinese films have indeed improved, then these large companies with relatively strong capital can achieve their proper results, while many small companies still have no way to develop. This phenomenon is not only unique to China. For example, in the United States, Columbia Pictures is generally not as good as MGM or other large companies with strong capital.</p>
<p>But I always think that no matter how small the company is, at least the story of the film should be made better. We always feel disgusted with Columbia's constant martial arts films, and that is the reason.</p>
<p>"Brothers' Blood" can be said to be very naive and ridiculous from the script to the performance, especially the story of revenge.</p>
<p>Let's think about it. Simply depicting vulgar love is already a superficial expression, let alone demanding that men and women who originally didn't know what "sacred love" was be faithful to honest love; or trying to write simple things between men and women as celestial beings, which cannot help but make people laugh. In addition, explaining jealousy and murder with stale talks such as "harming others harms oneself first... the net of heaven is inescapable" is especially old-fashioned and vulgar.</p>
<p>In terms of performance, it is like elementary school students writing compositions. We only ask for fluency, but the director of "Brothers' Blood" didn't even achieve this point, let alone anything else?</p>
<p>However, to lower the standards a bit, the scene of a small bird in a tree is still good-looking. In addition, the minor mistakes are simply countless.</p>
<p>I hope that the authors of "Brothers' Blood" will work harder.</p>
<h3>Review of "Risky Encounter"</h3>
<p>— Moore</p>
<p>Last Trail</p>
<p>The romance of "hero and beauty" is dramatic and has been adopted by filmmakers for a long time. Because this type of film is imaginary and the formula has gradually been rejected by the audience, it seems that filmmakers have not completely abandoned this type of story, so in the current decline of Western films, we still see this "Risky Encounter."</p>
<p>General criticisms of martial arts films are already sufficient. At the same time, because this type of film is "stereotyped" (more formulaic than formulaic), criticism of this type of film also has to be more repetitive; although this cannot be used to prove the formulaic nature of film criticism, it is at least a "waste" because audiences have long become the most accurate and strictest critics.</p>
<p>Because of the outdated content, new forms naturally will not arise. Our director should first propose economics when dealing with this story. He first concentrates the material of the story, and then removes its branches and leaves. This is because the director also knows that all martial arts films are disliked by the audience. If many old scenes are displayed in full, it will only deepen the audience's disgust, so he only narrates quickly and concisely.</p>
<p>However, the producers of "Risky Encounter," although abandoning many disgusting elements, immediately fell into another evil path. That is the addition of comedy, which he may think is too monotonous in the story that has been stripped of its branches and leaves, so he added some jokes to adjust it. However, this kind of bad and unreasonable work only destroys the atmosphere.</p>
<p>This is the end of the discussion of "Risky Encounter" itself. Below, I would like to explain the comparison between modern American martial arts films and "Don Quixote." "Don Quixote," whether the author of the novel or the author of the film, expresses sympathy for the fate of "Don Quixote" in the same way. However, the producers of modern American films are completely fantasizing about "chivalrous and generous" heroes. In "Don Quixote," we see the decline of ancient knights. Therefore, it is more realistic, while modern American martial arts films are simply daytime dreams with no reality at all. If we use reality to criticize the value of works, then this is easy to understand.</p>
<p>Martial arts films have been handed over to a declining fate. Here, we see the future of film!</p>
<p>Audience Opinions</p>
<h3>My Opinion on "Evil Neighbors"</h3>
<p>— Fu</p>
<p>Yueming Film Company, which has always specialized in producing "Kanto Heroes" and "Female Bodyguards," has recently changed its style and produced works of the times.</p>
<p>Strictly speaking, the ideology and plot of "Evil Neighbors" feel too ideal and too complex. The worst thing is that they also inserted a section of what (?) "Kunlun Mountain Female Knight" to stage a martial arts fight, and committed the inherent problem. This has to be a pity for Yueming Company. However, the motive of the author of the script for this film is still very admirable.</p>
<p>Of course, a film does not rely entirely on the correctness of consciousness. The efforts of the actors are also part of the relationship. The first few actors in "Evil Neighbors" made efforts, including Zhang Yuting and Wang Feijuan, who were also very good. He Feiguang's insidiousness is not bad.</p>
<p>The director's skills are not bad. The photography is much better than before. In short, this "Evil Neighbors" is much better than Yueming Company's previous films. It is also very rare among the small companies.</p>
<h3>"Evil Neighbors" - My Review</h3>
<p>— Ding Ding</p>
<p>What surprised me was the photography. Not only was it unlike the output of a small company as generally imagined, but it was also sufficient to compete with the output of large companies. Except for a few shots where the light was a little too strong, the entire film was exceptionally clear and lovely, and the scene transitions were very novel and chic.</p>
<p>The director's techniques are clever and flexible. He can use some small tricks to give the audience some amusement. However, there are two points that I cannot help but question.</p>
<p>(1) Where exactly is Huang Youjia, the silkworm farmer, located - in the countryside, or in the same bustling city as Huang Huaren? Raising silkworms in a bustling city is already somewhat far-fetched, and wearing a Western suit to raise silkworms in the countryside would probably be even more unrealistic! And why do all the hooligans have to wear tattered Western suits?</p>
<p>(2) One evening, when Huang Huaren and Zhihua were enjoying the moon in the garden, they were both wearing light clothing. But soon after, when Zhihua pulled Huaren out to buy a jade bottle, Zhihua was already wearing a leather short jacket. Did the weather change that quickly?</p>
<p>In terms of the actors, the ones playing Huang Huaren and Wu Zhihua are both suitable, especially the one playing the servant Cai Ma-fu, whose movements are natural and without the affected attitude of a typical servant portrayal. The one playing Guofen seems to have too few expressions.</p>
<p>Finally, I should say that "Evil Neighbors" is always worth seeing.</p>
<p>Film Novel</p>
<h3>Shanghai 24 Hours (7)</h3>
<p>— Tian Fu</p>
<p>The air in the room was so heavy it felt like it was about to explode. The distant sound of a whistle announced that it was noon. Old Chen's wife sadly raised her head, thinking: the deceased's sister is still sweating away at work in the factory, the fate of this family...</p>
<p>Old Zhao, who was silently weeping, suddenly spoke, asking Chen Da's wife: "Why hasn't his older brother returned?"</p>
<p>"Him?" Old Chen's wife widened her eyes, as if a bomb had exploded in her head: "The heavens are blind! Last night, the comprador's house was robbed, and they insist it was him... They arrested him and put him in jail." Then, she continued in a ghostly monologue: "One dead, one in jail... the whole family is finished... finished, everything is finished..."</p>
<p>As she said this, Old Zhao's complexion suddenly underwent a dramatic change: one moment flushed red, the next turning ashen, with sweat streaming down his head. He did not want to inadvertently being a "substitute for the scapegoat" to harm his friend. He was deeply distressed, feeling that a huge violence was ravaging his soul. Old Chen's wife looked at him in amazement. He shouted violently: "I stole that thing, that thing! I can't implicate you, I'll turn myself in! I'll turn myself in!"</p>
<p>When she suddenly realized the inside story of this matter from her surprise and doubt, Old Zhao had already run madly out of the door like a wild beast who lost his humanity.</p>
<p>(10) An Ordinary Day</p>
<p>Two hours later. Old Chen, who was confusedly imprisoned in jail, was anxiously fretting: suddenly a jailer escorted Old Zhao into the jail wearing shackles. He looked at Old Zhao in surprise, but Old Zhao smiled and went to him. He was wondering: how did Old Zhao get arrested too? But another jailer suddenly came in and released him.</p>
<p>Like a little bird escaping from its cage, Old Chen flew home.</p>
<p>Old Chen's wife was surprised when she saw her husband suddenly return, and she also felt a trace of relief; but when she thought of the reason her husband was released, the scene of Old Zhao shouting "I'll turn myself in!" and running out madly flashed through her mind; she was also moved to sudden tears.</p>
<p>Old Chen's eyes were fixed on that small bed, the corpse of their younger brother, who had lost his life, lying stiffly there: two incense sticks were burning on the bed. The incense smoke curled upwards, rising into the space, disappearing from sight. Old Chen's heart, however, kept sinking, sinking, sinking...</p>
<p>Time passed ordinarily for a day: it was four o'clock. The arteries of the metropolis were still throbbing violently. The comprador's wife got out of bed again, drinking chicken broth, thinking about how to squander this night in wild revelry.</p>
<p>Cars, foreign-style houses, women, mesmerizing dances...</p>
<p>Unemployment, injury, imprisonment, death...</p>
<p>Every day, every day, cycling day and night. Shanghai is forever so lively, brilliant, and magnificent... (The End)</p>
