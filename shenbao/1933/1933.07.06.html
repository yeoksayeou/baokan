<p>（北平）薛之珩等在大連數度與喜多及李際春等會議、今日薛電平報告、對其他問題、暫擱置不談、改編僞軍、由薛以私人資格單獨與李際春及關東軍代表接洽改編、僞軍額數尙未確定、駐防地點、擬定鐵路遠之遷安·蘆龍·各縣、北寗路與僞奉山路聯運、亦與該路僞局長關鐸磋商雙方意見一致日方所提要求我方主張留待將來會商、免影響目前交涉、（五日專電）</p>

<p>（北平）處置灤東僞軍問題仍在交涉中、惟内容複雜、非短期内可解决、故我方接委薛之珩等尙在大連繼續磋商至各處日軍撤退事、聞日武官已正式通知我方、謂灤東一帶日軍、大部已陸續撤退朝鮮錦州等處至該處殘留之少數日軍、一週内即可完全撤往長春附近、特請我方派員接收、聞日方欲藉僞軍改編問題、作一種政治上之要求、故在會議席上、高抬巿價、意存刁難、會議進行因以遲緩（五日專電）</p>

<p>（天津）路訊、平唐段每日暫開七次十次各一列、因唐山站軌道被兵車擁塞、刻正設法疏能通預料十日可恢復各次客貨列車、連日與日方交涉甚順利、希望在最短期間通車至榆關、刻下唐山車站仍由僞軍監視管理、（五日專電）</p>
<p>（大連）大連會議所討論之改編僞軍問題、中國代表已接黄郛回訓、故於今晨十時半復開會議、大體似已决定容納僞軍之要求、因此岡村副參謀長喜多大佐與中國方面代表雷榮壽殷炯及僞軍方面代</p>

<h3>中東路賣買交涉蘇俄與僞國正面衝突</h3>
<p>暫行休會研究雙方提案</p>
<p>日外務省責俄不守信義</p>
<p>（東京）中東路賣買交涉之第四次會議五日下午二時半開會除蘇滿兩方代表外、日本西及鈴木兩人亦列席、俄代表由禮尼夫大使最先宣讀聲明書、主張中東路之所有權、由過去歷史及條約關係而論、完全屬於俄國、俄方此項聲明、恰如投一巨大炸彈、「滿洲國」代表丁士源亦宣讀聲明書、駁謂、試觀俄國十月革後之狀態及加拉罕宣言、蘇俄已經抛棄其所有權爲明顯之事、故俄方僅有極薄弱基礎之共營權而已、於是兩方關於所有權問題開始激烈討論、而致正面衝突、結果决定兩方交換彼此聲明書研究對方立塲、决定態度後再行討、論七時散會會議當局發表公報、謂第四次會議兩方發表聲明書、兩方决定研究對方聲明書、知悉其内容之後、再定次屆會議時日（五日日聯電）</p>
<p>（東京）昨晚蘇俄方面發出出售中東路之說帖後、在東京之「滿洲國」代表團即發一宣言、表明被等對此事之態度謂「滿洲國」僅準備以日金五千萬元購買該路云、（五日路透電）</p>
<p>（東京）日方對於中東路售價問題、原禁各報登載、但自俄方單獨發表說帖後、此項禁令己自動解除、今日會議、「滿洲國」僅願以五千萬日金收買中東路、同時要求俄方保證以前該路之儥商槪由俄方負責、但蘇俄政府則要求以金盧布二萬五千萬出售該路及一切附屬產業、其付欵辦法則以半數爲現金、半數爲貨物、至於現金部份之四分之一、須立即付給、其餘之部份可以以債劵代之云、（五日路透電）</p>
<p>（東京）關於中東路讓渡之第四次會議、定本日午後二時半在重光次官邸由丁士源主席開會、但已經提出之讓渡價格及其他俄滿間主張、已大懸殊、形式的順序、雖先審議蘇俄案、然豫料開會劈頭必有相當紛糾、故讓渡交涉、於未入　質的討論以前、必成價局、（五日電通電）</p>
<h3>蘇俄之照會</h3>
<p>（東京）蘇俄方面代表關於中東路讓渡、提案於三日中東路會議之照會、昨由大使館發表、其内容如下、㈠蘇俄政府同意將根據北東京及奉天恊之中束路與附屬財產賣與「滿洲國」、然不屬於中東路而在交涉當時扣留於該鐵路上之各種蘇俄財產、因車輛之交換尙未照恊約履行、故該鐵路上所餘之蘇俄財產、當然不在賣却之列、此等財產應返還蘇俄政府、其財產目錄之確定的調查、應由特别委員會行之茲將應賣却者列下、（甲）本線一七二六　米補助線二五五四四九　米、電報線二五七六　米、（乙）鐵路附屬之機車車輛運轉材料、（丙）鐵路及旅客用建物其總面積百十九萬九千平方米及其他、㈡因讓度中東路於蘇俄方面利益極多之各種條約、其旣得利益已經消滅、一部且减少非常之價値、㈢論及中東路之意義、須强硬主張爲歐亞交通上之重要幹線、㈣破壞中東路之正當活動者、爲最近發生之特殊條件、致使財政狀態一時惡化、但此不能與該鐵路實質的意義相混、（五日電通電）</p>
<p>（東京）蘇俄方面提案中關於讓渡北滿鐵道之金額、及其支付方法曾有種種傳說、其最確實者現悉如下、㈠讓渡金額、爲二億五千萬金盧布、（每盧布合日金一元零四分、）㈡支付方法、總額分兩起、一億二千五百萬金盧布以商品支付、其期限爲二年、年付三次、其他之半數、三分之一爲現金、即時支付、三分之二分四年支付、利息爲年四厘、（五日電通電）</p>
<p>（東京）駐日俄大使由禮尼夫四日下午四時半訪問外務省内田外相、希望日本對於中東路出賣交涉與以好意的助力並開陳俄方之意見外相答謂、本問題之解决、非但使俄滿兩國國交親密、又係樹立遠東和平之關鍵、故商議前途雖多難關然應由大局觀察、並努力向交涉成立之途徑邁進云云、（五日日聯電）</p>
<h3>僞國之提案</h3>
<p>（東京）「滿國」方面關於中東鐵道讓渡交涉之提案内容如下、㈠蘇俄方面允將中東鐵道及其附帶事業之一切權利讓渡與」滿洲國「、「滿洲國」允付代價五千萬日金、其支付期及方法别定之、㈡自本條約調印日起、一個月内「滿洲國」政府任命接收中東鐵道委員、又自調印日起、三個月内接收中東鐵道、及其附帶事業、與一切所屬之財產、㈢蘇俄政府對於中東鐵路一九一七年三月九日以前之一切股東社債權者等、及其他儥權者之請求、負擔全部責任、又三月九日以後、迄條約發生效力之一切債務、由蘇俄政府負責、㈣蘇俄政府將關於中東路及附帶事業之書類、交付「滿洲國」、㈤其他事項另行提出、提案理由現在之中東路不僅無價値將來「滿洲國」完成鐵道後、勢將减低價値、緣中東路軌道現已朽毁、即月台亦不合時代、無使用之價値、現若建築鐵道新線、僅一億三千萬日金即可建築、故若考慮現在之老朽狀態、則僅値六千五百萬日金、蘇俄所有權利作半數計、實祇三千二百五十萬日金、至於中東路一切債權、由蘇俄負責、同時由政治的大局見地、五千萬日金係屬適當、</p>
<h3>我國之反對</h3>
<p>（南京）蘇俄於中蘇恢復邦交、遽向日本提議出售中東路、始則種種掩飾、繼則强詞解釋、違反事實法理、對中俄恊定所規定各項、悍然不顧、對我二次抗議亦無適合事理之答復、致我國與論前對蘇俄熱烈同情者、一變爲反對之論調、殊於二國邦交及民族感情均有妨礙、現調查發電反對蘇俄出售中東路者、不下千餘起云、（五日中央社電）</p>
<h3>法國之注意</h3>

<h3>論留學制度之積弊</h3>
<p>— 伯</p>
<p>署期已屆。又到一學年終。在此一期内之大學生。中又將有若干人或得公費或挾私資。乘長風破萬里浪留學異邦矣。以我國敎育之衰。落實業之凋敵。科學之不發達。文化之停滯。此輩靑年學生。遠游異邦以資深造。以備國家他日之。用吾人誠不勝其欣幸。更不勝其盼望。然而吾人試一回顧數年來過去之事實。多數留學生歸國之後。亦未必遂能求得若何有實用之學問。更未必能於我國家有若何貢獻。上焉者搬演不合國情之洋八股。下焉者則挾留學生之資格。以誇耀親友。以爲獵取功名之階梯。甚且各就其所留學之國。結爲團體。成爲派别互相排擠。各騖其私。此所以洋翰林之毁多於譽。留學生之功不補過也。夫靑年留學。原期有益於國家。而其結果。所得甚微。此中癓結。果安在。耶一方爲留學制度之不良。而另一方則爲留學生本身之自覺悟也。</p>
<p>試觀今日我國靑年中得挾巨資以留學海外者。大多數爲襲先人餘蔭之富家公子。與夫有權親貴戚之貴胃子弟。此兩者留學之目的。多爲嚮往異國風光。抱享樂之志而去。至於眞心有志求學之貧苦靑年。則終身惟有望洋興歎其。結果乃致留學者不學。即學亦未必適合於用。而有志於學者。則徒抱向隅之憾。如是而欲望國家獲得可用之人材。不亦難乎。此則失之於派遣時漫無計劃之故也。次則赴法赴美。私費生一任其自由。公費生亦常不加抉擇。夫各國之國情不同。文化藝術之形態亦異。惟其不同。故我國之派遣學生留學。亦即應參酌我國之所短與我國之所需詳細支配先確定一派遣之方針然而起視今日之所謂留學者。其本身固毫無目的。政府亦未聞有若何方針。批留學者返。一批留學者去。返者何所得。去者又何所爲。曾無人肯一思及。此又失之一於派遣留學時漫無目標之故也。</p>
<p>故今日而欲獲得留學之良果。則政府與留學者。必須洗去從前之積弊否則以昔例今。吾人恐又終不免於失望耳。</p>
<p>茲當留學生諸君行將準備起程之始。吾人希望無窮。故敢略舉過去積弊。以貢獻於政府當局及爲國努力之留學諸君。</p>

<h3>倫敦經濟會議延延空氣異常濃厚</h3>
<p>羅斯福總統致代表團新訓令</p>
<p>大會最後成敗關鍵實繫於此</p>
<p>（倫敦美總統刻正準備關於美國貨幣政策之新宣言、藉圖挽救、此項新宣言究竟能否應順金本位國之願望、美代表團固不能作預諾、但目前已有一種新希望、冀能在雙方間覓得一中間塲地俾經濟一組仍可繼續會議、法財丰龐萊亦將靜待美國新宣言、惟仍自認抱悲觀態度聲稱、苟幣價之跳舞不止、則除停會外别無可爲、（四日國民電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）經濟會議主幹委員員開會後、形勢仍無變化、現惟等待羅斯福總統之新宣言、用金本位各國仍力主延會之必要、主幹委員會會議完畢時、美國代表赫爾已接得羅斯福總統之新提議當立即提出、會議乃於上午十一點四十五分停會、以俟羅斯福之新宣言、現信羅斯福之宣言、特别注重經濟會議在經濟方面進行工作之可能、羅斯福承認貨幣委員會延會數月之必要、但主張維持經濟委員會及所屬各小組委員會之工作、經濟會議方面人士以爲羅斯福之觀點、與經濟委員會内多數代表之意見實相抵觸、蓋經濟委員會多數代表以爲貨幣及經濟兩項工作、必須同時進行也、此外尙有一種傳說、尙未能證明其可信否、即謂羅斯福提議創立一種國際匯劃單位、其機　棋甚爲複、雜經濟會議休息室内有人以爲此項傳說、如經證實、則此種機　必經過相當時期方可整理就緒、并俟經濟會議暴日開會時始可定局、至華盛頓訓令是否立即發表、或待明日主席團會議時始乃提出、則美國代表團現尙在考慮中、（五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>隔大西洋電報電話頻繁</h3>
<p>（倫敦）羅斯福總統與美代表團間現電報往來、迄未終畢、出席成界經濟大會之他國代表團莫不竚候其結果、美代表團已於夜間接到美總統第一次來電、但據美代表團方面現所傳出之消息、則事態尙未充分結晶化、不能發表其政策、今晨十時一刻起、美代表團開始與美總統互換意見、電報往來迄今未斷、預料關於繼續大會之談判、午後三時可達重要關鍵、屆時美代表團　可接到美總統之電話、聞美國務卿赫爾現與英相麥唐納及他國代表分頭接洽、美總統第一電、聞係說明性質、並不爲對於大會之直接興奮劑、但總括局勢、並表示對於大會之樂觀耳、美代表團會商兩小時半、至午後十二時三刻始散、據其意見、似以空氣現漸澄淸、雖美代表現未以其討論之結果通知他人、但表示大會空氣現較昨日更爲友好之意見、摩萊敎授參加今晨會議、美代表團聲稱、在數小時内未必有具體文告發表、因在接到美總統最後訓令後美代表團將與他國代表討論之、然後始可將任何提議交付主幹部明日會議也云、（五日路透電）</p>
<h3>美新提議金國未能愜意</h3>
<p>（倫敦）美總統企圖挽救經濟會議之新提議、未能使歐陸金本位國滿意、目下會議之停開、顯已不成問題、</p>
<p>美總統新提議非正式分送各代表後、今晨主幹部即開指導委員會討論、據其通知美總代表之結果、苟非美總統能有更多之貢獻、則覺解决僵局之最佳辦法、唯有休會而留數經濟小組委員會繼續工作而已、</p>
<p>按今日上午會議所在之地質學博物院與美代表團所居之克賴里奇旅館、莫不忙於作最後之挽救、但經大會及兩大委員會之主席副主席報告員等開指導委員會議兩小時後、法財長出語新聞記者、以譏刺口吻聲稱、吾輩曾鵠候羅斯福總統之一電、似乎該電將可換轉一切者、比外相希孟亦同様悲觀、聲稱時局極爲惡劣、斯時美代表團即在所居旅館集議力求避免負担會議失敗之責任、常藉大西洋無線電話與華盛頓頻頻談話、並與倫敦其他代表團時常接觸、據聞今日下午美代表團將發一宣方澄淸時局、重申解决貨幣問題、在會議其他工作上並非根本要圖、勸會中從事非常重要之經濟問題、據聞羅斯福之新訓令、幾乎比星期一電報更爲直率、（五日國民電）</p>
<h3>判死刑抑緩刑</h3>
<p>用全國對美抱懷疑</p>
<p>（倫敦）今晨感想爲世界經濟大會已判死刑、但可緩刑耳、小麥問題已獲恊定之消息、確爲一種補劑、引起更大樂觀不過用金國對於午後三時美總統所可發來之重要電話是否可爲緩刑、仍甚爲懷疑也、除用金國外、大多數代表團現似有對於避免延會的努力、予以援助之動作、聞美代表諸人對於美總統來電、有莫明其妙之處、據美代表之解釋、美總統似謂渠對金本位並無永遠反對、但對於恢復金本位之方法則有問題、美代表接此來電爲之眩惑、蓋以此電可作美總統政策已有變更之解也、故已電致華盛頓請予說明、預料午後三時可接美總統電話、並料晚間或可發出切實文告、法荷兩國方面在羣方龐雜之中、仍堅持其欲望美總統提出可爲用金國接受的貨幣方案、實屬無益之說、並闢美總統或可提出辦法而使大會在經範圍内活動進行之謠言、謂貨幣苟無恊定、經濟安能進步云、（五日路透電）</p>
<h3>延會與否問題</h3>
<p>待今日主幹會决定</p>
<p>（倫敦）倫敦經濟會議之中止、今日已成爲無可避免之局面、今日主幹委員會復召集特别會議、討論可使會議勉强結束之方式、荷蘭首可柯里恩氏、當即提議休會而法比兩國代表即行附議、使全塲爲之撟呑不下、美國代表亦表示贊成延會、並稱會議如此下塲深堪惋惜、美國代表某氏復稱、他日美國恢復自身經濟地位之計完成後、大西洋兩岸諸國之諒解得以增進之時、或者會議有重開之望云、英首相麥唐納當時對於延會之動議、並未表可示否蓋英代表團内部對於此問題、尙覺意見紛歧、如財相張伯倫氏亦謂會議不如中止云、或者英國對於會議之中止、將不持反對之論也、至於會議究竟延與否、尙須俟主幹委員會下屆會議於星期四日討論後始可决定、並以會議如此停頓、足使外界對於美國發生不良之感想、或者美國政府不願担負此重大之責任、故尙望一二日内美總統羅斯福有新訓令頒到、使會議得蒙救於埀危、亦未可知、（四日國民電）</p>
<h3>赫爾獲坎代表贊助臨時請求展緩討論</h3>
<p>（倫敦）世界經濟會議主幹委員會已延會至星期四日、目前各方雖以爲世界經濟會議將於星期四日閉幕、但美國代表仍極力設法延長會議之壽命、因外間已嘖有煩言、謂經濟會議係羅斯福總統所破壞也、（四日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）今日上午各方皆信休會已不可免、因此行政會議中即决定訓令主幹委員草擬停會方式、但至午後六時主幹委員會開會時、形勢稍見轉易、美國務卿赫爾得坎大首相邊納德之擁護、起而竭力反對停會、邊納德亦稱此事過於重大、不宜怱遽决定、委員會卒從赫爾之言、暫時休會、蓋主席麥唐納亦不欲會議之夭折、願待美國新宣言也、（四日國民電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）今晨主幹部會議指派草擬最後提案之小組會、以英首相麥唐納財相張伯倫法財長龐萊荷相柯里恩組成之、午後三時此小組會討論紦錄大會所得結果、及聲叙不得不延延理由之議案、正欲通過之、忽有使者至、持美代表團之函、送交英相麥唐納、請主幹部暫緩舉行、謂有重要事件接洽云、查主幹部本定今晚六時舉行、英相旣接此函、遂停止四人小組會之會議、而與美方某代表談話半小時、英相旋通知起草委員會、謂赫爾一時莫能與美總統接洽、故美代表團不能有關於延會之决定云、英相繼决定六時召集主幹部會議、迨晚間六時集會、英相代表指導會提出延會動議、赫爾抗議並建議星期四日主幹部再開會議、法龐萊與意任格皆建議改星期三日再議但卒依允美代表之建議定星期四日開會、惟聲明屆時必須有切實解决辦法、依彼等意見、最善手續即爲今晨主幹部所議定之延會辦法、至是世界經濟大會之生死、將决於星期四日之會議、（四日路透社電）</p>

<p>安那波里斯　羅斯福總統今晚起程赴華盛頓、據其左右言、美總統返京辦事後、當可决定渠所望於世界經濟大會者究爲何物、美總統不願大會僅因少數國反對其通貨穩定之拒絶而遽延會、至於美國海陸與内務三部所提出之建設計畫、可否核准、想美總統不久將有表示、（四日路透電）</p>
<h3>各方面努力謀挽救繫鈴解鈴端賴美國</h3>

<h3>爪哇華僑考察團參觀本巿工廠</h3>
<p>認祖國工業均有相當發展</p>
<p>工廠待遇與設備亟須改良</p>
<p>南洋荷屬爪哇實業考察團於上月初抵滬先後赴杭州·南京·遊覧業已返滬連日至本巿各廠考察新新社記者昨訪該團於旅次茲將探詢各情分誌如下</p>
<h3>組織動機</h3>
<p>南洋荷屬爪硅美里逹華僑靑年會會長葉葳蘅夫婦及涂炳立夫人以該地華僑人口繁多平日以經營土產爲業對於各種實業尙未有相當之發展故發起組織爪哇華僑實業考察團計加入者除葉葳蘅夫婦徐炳立夫人外尙有施維康夫婦·陳瑞基·施瑞珍·一行共七人於上月初乘意大利康脫羅梭輪來滬後稍事休息曾先後赴杭州南京遊覧於日前返滬至本巿各工廠作實地考察</p>
<h3>參觀工廠</h3>
<p>該團連日往南洋兄弟烟草公司廣生行廣東兄弟公司美亞織綢廠三星棉織廠中國化學工業社家庭工業社泰康罐頭廠天廚味精廠天生滋味廠中華琺擲廠等各工廠分别考察於昨日起全體團員分赴本巿各紗廠考察所有考察所得實况曾撰成報告郵寄南洋星報披露</p>
<h3>考察感想</h3>
<p>新新社記者昨晤葉葳蘅君及金炳立夫人詢以此次考察所得之感想據稱此次來華考察以考察祖國實業發展之狀况爲限並無政治意味及其他背景連日考察結果覺美亞織綢廠之線織品質地堅靱光澤豁露其種種搆造實駕舶來品之上中華琺瑯之各種琺瑯品堅固耐用廣生行之各種化裝品色香俱佳三星棉織廠之浴衣浴巾汗衫褲毛巾色白質純亦臻棉織業之上乘其他各種工業亦均有相當之發展故祖國頻年來雖受天災人禍之重重壓逼而猶能努力掙扎使工業日就月將精益求精旅外已由中央造幣廠固封及審查會證明可免加封</p>
<h3>敼鑄廠條</h3>

<p>僑民見此種好現象深爲忻幸故此次考察之結果在本人認爲圓滿俟返南洋後當代爲宣傳以爲他山之助但圓滿中引爲憾事者覺各工廠待遇工人似嫌苛刻對於工人安全之設備亦過於簡陋工資應提高據考察之所得在生活程度增高之狀態下每日血汗所得猶不足謀一飽此宜一再注意者也對於未成年之童工宜禁止爲繁重之工作俾不致阻止其發育此外又有一事認爲不當者即爲人力車夫是日常作牛馬之生活實爲慘事希望實業家逐漸增設工廠使該項人力車夫得棄其牛馬生活而有入廠工作之機會此本人所禱祝者也記者又詢以何日離滬返爪哇則謂尙須數日勾留再往厦門廣州汕頭一帶考察然後返爪哇云</p>
<h3>爪哇現况</h3>

<h3>從誠惶誠恐說到言語不統一</h3>
<p>— 瞻廬</p>
<p>東北英雄王德林孔憲榮抗日歸來久，久留香港，各界歡迎王孔兩將軍談抗日經過，報紙上屢有紀載；而寓居半島酒店的前外交部長現任西南政委陳友仁氏，又渴欲和王孔兩將軍會面。幽默家的評論，以爲王孔兩將軍的抗日成績很好，但，兩位的貴姓合在一處，未免帶些「惶恐」吧。陳友仁和王將軍軍面，便成了「誠惶」，和孔將軍會面，又成了「誠恐」記得道士通疏，滿口的「誠惶誠恐」，這不是陳王陳孔會面的預兆麽？</p>
<p>誠惶會面，已在上星期舉行了；會面的地點，便在陳氏所寓的半島酒店。先由陳氏通電話於王德林氏，邀往半島酒店一叙，王氏欣然，赴約會陳；但，在相見之下，便發生着方語上的隔閡，只好實行其會面而不能實行其會話。陳氏不會操國語，王氏的國語又不大正確；卽以文字通達，亦有未能，王是不識中國字也不識外國字的，陳雖讀書識字，但，所讀的是外國書，所識的是外國字，又沒法和王氏溝通意見。後來，好容易覓到一位懂國語又懂英文的西裝朋友做繙譯，纔能夠談了一小時的話。談話的内容，報紙上旣代守秘密，我也不願意去妄加猜測；但，使我發生感慨的一點，便是兩位中國要人談話，須得有人在中間做繙譯，這怕不是好現象吧。陳王會面，旣是這般；陳孔會面，當然也不能免這言語上的隔閡。唉丨·言語不統一，簡直是一種「誠惶誠恐」的局面。</p>
<p>兩個中國人會話，要請一個中國人做繙譯，這還不算十二分惶恐；兩個中國人會話，要請一個外國人做繙譯，這纔是十二分的惶恐了。中國言語長此不統一，將來難免要請外國人做同胞會面的譯人；前途暗礁，不堪設想，只好哼一句文天祥的「惶恐灘頭說惶恐」，做我這篇「誠惶誠恐」的結論。</p>
<h3>别有一番景象</h3>
<p>— 鈴花</p>
<p>典當裏出出進進皮袍，換棉袍，而夾袍，而單長衫，狗舌整天拖到口外乘凉，於是乎署天來了。</p>
<p>在鄕間，水田裏靑蛙，閣閣地鳴個不停，樹枝上灰蟬，知了地噪個不止，一個蚊子翁翁翁，二個蒼蠅哼哼哼，倒也怪有趣的，但在上海，却别有一番景象。</p>
<p>到了熱天，各公園的橙子，給一個個屍，壓迫得喘不過來，那是不消說得就是花木扶疏之處，甚至於跑馬廳裏，人跡罕至的草地上，也會有人捉對兒光臨的。</p>
<p>游泳池，當然是摩登士女的逭署勝地，就是蘇州裏，也儘有學游泳，而順便蕩滌瑕穢的，更其是終年在橋上迎送過客的流浪兒童，從橋欄杆上跳下水去的姿勢，是很値得欣賞的。</p>
<p>本地飯店，無錫麵館，堂官老爺，一律裸着上身，在人堆裏擠，這是守的古風，不比大飯店，咖啡座等，老是洋鬼子化的。在純粹中國人的住宅區裏，不只是吃食店如是，就是南貨店，北貨店等等的先生們，也都表示着曲綫之美，以待藝術家欣賞。</p>
<p>到了晚上，馬路兩旁的人行道上，頭對頭，脚對脚，頭對脚，脚對頭的，睡滿了避署而兼避臭蟲者。雖然常有被汽車碾斃者，但未被碾斃者，却依舊不肯犧牲這權利，因爲巿政機關裏，尙未想到簽發露睡照會。</p>
<p>第一流人物，都離滬避署於是第二流人物，把辦公處時鐘，開快一小時。據說，熱天，早上起得早，落得提早一小時，那麽，四點鐘公畢了，開電風扇，聽無線電話，吃西瓜，喝汽水，不亦快哉。</p>

<h3>黄瓜歌</h3>

<p>掘開土，種黄瓜，種瓜女子貌如花。分開十指尖手，一把爛泥一把沙。</p>
<p>肩桃水，澆黄瓜，澆瓜女子貌如花，相帮哥嫂　秧去，日晒背心箸帽遮。</p>
<p>籐滿地，採黄瓜，採瓜女子貌如花。靑筋白脚無人惜，暮朝朝踏水車。</p>
<p>農忙過，吃黄瓜，吃瓜女子貌如花，天天要把營生趕，日坐布機夜紡紗。</p>
<h3>荷花大少</h3>
<p>— 愼敏</p>
<p>號稱十里洋塲，繁華巿會的上海，是大少聚集之區。而大少之中，也有所謂荷花大少，桂花大少的名稱，大少，儘管大少就是了丨何必還要加上了一個很香艷的頭銜，那眞是生面别開呢丨據說這個荷花大少，是應時而生的，也可算是一種時令的摩登人物啊。但一過了夏令，那些荷花大少，一變而爲桂花大少了。</p>
<p>荷花大少的狀態，要算花中最大而最漂亮的一種。你只要走到荷花池畔，曲欄橋邊，駐足小立，凝眸張望，那些白玉色和粉紅色的荷花姑娘，一個個對你點頭微笑，搖曳生姿，淸風齊來，淸香四溢，而且很有一點詩意。</p>
<p>以大少爺來譬喻荷花，也有一些很充份的理由，和像形的意義，可以證明。大少所戴的草帽，與開放的荷花相似。所穿荷緑色的華絲紗長衫，與隨風飄蕩的荷葉比較，也沒有什麽兩様。手裏所拿的司的克，宛似荷梗。足上所穿的雪白絲襪，和白帆布鞋兒，又好像肥胖的嫩藕。一陣陣巴黎香水的香味，比荷花的香氣更濃。但是一過了夏季，草帽破碎，而且落了令，要想辦一頂呢帽，可是阮嚢羞澀，只好做一個秃頭大少，好像荷花瓣落盡，單剩了一個的蓮蓬頭。荷緑色的長衫，也失却了時間性，要添辦一件夾衫吧，則袁頭宣告脫離關係，正是天寒單衣薄，大少只好立壁角，又可說天寒單衣薄，一似風吹荷葉落了。</p>
<p>在「枇杷黄，大少藏，」的時節，另外發現了許多荷花大少，時交夏令，只須穿上一件漂亮的長衫，所費幾何，就可得到一個很現成的荷花大少頭銜。眞是輕而易舉，任憑你張三李四，可大出而特出其風頭。非若冬季裏的大少，非雙套狐裘，厚呢大衣，不能得大少的資格</p>

<p>第十回聞語警芳心封侯願渺</p>
<p>聽歌現羡色報國身閑</p>
<p>他正如此想着，就不住的抬頭向包廂裏看去。黄曼英看出他的情形來了，輕輕的將他的手胳臂一碰。桂枝一回頭，曼英低聲道：你看不出來吧？這個闊太太，在半年以前，也和我一様，是個窮學生，後來在一個地方，讓這位李旅長看上了，就把他討了去做新太太。桂枝道：怎麽呌新太太呢？曼英道：你想呀，這個年頭兒，講究男女平權，認識幾個字的女學生那個肯去做人家的姨太太？可是現在好一點的男人，差不多都讓人家預先搶去了。雖然是不難在人家手上把男人搶過來，可是一定要把那個人轟了出去，就不大容易。只有辦着兩頭大，各自成家，除了共一個丈夫，别的事情，誰不管誰。當然，姨太太是不許呌。太太太呢，原來的人，又不答應，所以自從革命以後，出了一個名詞，呌新太太。桂枝道：那其實還是姨太太罷了。曼英道：不，從前的姨太太，不能同老爺並坐並行，而今的新太太，可是一切都像人家原配太太一様，什麽事都可以當權。尤其是交際這様事情，完全是新太太的。桂枝點點頭道：哦丨原來是這樣的。設若老爺討了新太太之後，再討新太太呢，那是不是呌新太太？曼英笑道：這個我倒沒有聽到說過。江氏笑道：睢戲罷，跑到戲館子來撩天來了。桂枝雖不便再說話，可是他看看戲台上，必定就要看看包廂裏。心裏這就想說話，可是他看看戲台上，必定就要看看包廂裏。心裏這就想着，多少嫁軍人的，都闊的了不得，向來都是耳朶聽見，於今親自看到，這話倒的確是不錯的了。（一二一）</p>

<h3>夏日的蘇州</h3>
<p>— 朱𦐂</p>
<p>太陽上這麽的發着炎威，氣候是這麽感着窒悶；可怕的炎夏，是明顯地到大地來了。然而華北戰雲，旣告停止，秦淮　管，早見承平，我國的一切，像早恢復了太平盛世的景象，在這賽過世外桃源的蘇州，更充滿着活氣，尤其是在夏日薄暮的一刹那。</p>
<p>公園艷跡　蘇州有公園，雖然少曲折的布置；丨記得雲南趙松泉曾有詠公園詩：「車過公園的，一目卽了了丨」句。丨然而在夏季時候，那寛敝的環境，凉風徐來，確與上海顧家宅花園（卽法國公園）不相上下。並且園裏除了東齊，西亭兩個茶　，搭了凉棚售風凉茶外，還有自然農塲，三民，華羽等商店，出售冷食，當那氷冷的飲料，一盃在手，淸凉的和風，吹上面龐，公園確乎是一個避署勝地。於是到了傍晚時，公園裏面，到處塞滿了老的，少的，村的，俏的各色游人。尤其是一班摩登人物，那祇穿襯衫的靑年，赤了大脚的女郎，對對雙雙，翩翩地滿園飄舞，在暗淡的燈光下面，給小報上製造不少的艷史韻事。</p>
<p>金　鶯燕　在祇顧假面具的禁娼令下，吳宫花草，確已暗淡得多；除了些佩掛徽章的特殊人物，敢在民慶里面歌女妝閣裏，和酒議事，别項人物，究不敢公然報效。好了，現在娼妓開禁，已將於七月起實行。從此金國一角，又可恢復鶯燕世界；楚館秦樓，粉白羅列，酒緣燈紅，笙歌徹衢了。那班走馬靑年，垂鞭豪客，旣可儘量揮霍，一般商人，也不托庇餘蔭，恢復那不景氣的巿面哩丨</p>
<p>應時的食物　夏日的應時食物，除了瓜菓以外，當然要推冷食了。那歐化的冰潔濂，鮮橘水，和沙水等等，都成了摩登人物最普通的飲料和食物。蘇州特製的冷食，也有幾種：像白色的扁豆糕，上面放着緑色的薄荷糖，色彩旣佳，滋味也甜腴可口。緑豆湯更有淸心的功效。今年北京信遠齋的酸梅湯，也來蘇發售了。菜餚中有兩種佳肴，鮮荷葉粉蒸肉，淸香肥美；西瓜鷄鮮美肥嫩，都是老鑒家唯一恩物。</p>
<p>會的擁擠　時局是不景氣，於是一般富貴生意，都感到有尋出路的需要，尤其是靠書　餬口的藝術家，因着潤格的束縛，不能自行舉行大賤價，於是書　的展覽，就應時產生了。今歲蘇州展覽的盡會，除了當地畫家，有西冷趙肅英，嘉興岳仲沂，吳興錢雲鶴；預備前來的，更大有人在。然而蘇州畢竟是文墨之邦，那前來展覽的　會，雖然不乏佳作，然而能欣賞藝術的人，究屬少數，於是各　師大都是乘興而來，敗興而歸，能夠弄出盤費和開支，已是不容易的事了。</p>
<p>夏令的衛生　蘇州的夏令衛生，雖然有區公所和公安局來執行；但他們大都在熱　的街衢上注重淸潔，僻巷小街，往往瓜皮狼籍，苍蠅亂飛，尤其是小河裏面，更不住的發生惡臭。所以有人說區公所對於衛生的設備，最好於增添淸道夫外，還添幾名淸河夫，去淸潔河道，那麽在衛生方面，必定很有益處呢丨</p>

<h3>婦女界與國貨推銷</h3>
<p>— 仰葊</p>
<p>最近中華國貨產銷合作恊會，爲力求增進國貨推銷起見，時常與婦女界聯絡，談話中間，頗得許多至理，確爲國貨界應有的知識。</p>
<p>宋杏村夫人說：「很好的國貨，因爲鍊製不潔凈，裝璜不美麗，說明不詳細，用法不講求，以致顧客購了不能滿意，買了不能利用，因此减少許多銷路。尤其是銷貨的公司一不經心，便無形中斷送許多好主顧，據美國某雜誌調查，因爲售貨員的種種不周到問題，使顧客不光顧的，要佔到百分之九十四，可見推銷的重要了。</p>
<p>余英傑夫人說：吾前在國外讀書時，深感到美國的工商界，對於消費者的心理，沒有不曲盡心思，以迎合他們，引誘他們，他們的出品製出以後，能使消費者不得不買。譬如美國的百貨公司内，不但貨物蒐羅極其完備，而且裏面的其他附帶的設備，也應有盡有。例如寫字間裏面，你可去寫信，信寫好後，公司裏面有郵局，你可以在一個很短的時間内，很便捷的把買的東西寄出去，使得消費者異常滿意，幾有入後不思復出的様子。至於工廠方面，則無時無地，不努力創製新出品，而且用種種方法，捉住主顧的信用，使他們對於該廠的出品，具有極大的信仰，歡迎採用，中國國貨工業，尙在幼稚時代，要想驟然和歐美並駕齊驅，勢不可能，但是逐步的改進，前途希望，很可樂觀。因爲現各國貨工廠的製造品，吾在中國國貨公司看見許多的出品，有的已勝過舶來了。</p>
<p>這二位女士的話，是代表一般婦女界的意見，入情入理，所說極有見解，大可作國貨界改進產銷方法的南針。</p>
<h3>夏令用品與學生</h3>
<p>— 詩典</p>
<p>跟着炎炎的夏令之來，大小學校都相繼在放署假了。背井離鄕，不遠千里而來都巿求學的靑年學子們，這時都準備返家歇夏去了。</p>
<p>在返家之前，男女學生們總要去採購些夏令應時用品。免得到内地之後，感到種種麻煩，他們這些帶歸去的用品，對於故鄕人民，是很有影響的。因爲内地人民，風氣之閉塞，自不必說；他們見到從外面，尤其是從上海去的人們衣服用品，總以是新隷的時髦的；引起他們爭相彷效購用。到於内地女學生和時髦的女性，更是喜歡模仿上海去的女學生服裝。上海歸去的男女學生們服裝用品，如果是外貨，往往也會引起他們去購用外貨。如果是國貨的話，他們也可以不期而然地服用國貨了。所以，從上海放假歸去的男女學生們帶的夏令用品，對於内地人民的影響煞大喲丨</p>
<p>學生們向來是很愛國的，過去的歷次偉大愛國運動，如五四咧，五卅咧，······他們倡貨的熱烈，實是値得社會人士欽佩的。可是，學生中却有一部份人對於國貨是沒有深切瞭解的；常有身穿漂亮西服，足登舶來革履，而站在臺上高喊提倡國貨的事。</p>
<p>在這國難頂在每一個同胞頭上的危難期中，夏令是已經臨到了，學生們在歸家去採購夏令用品的時候，應該請明瞭；夏令用品和你們是有這般重大關係，爲着貫澈你們赤誠的愛國心起見，應該努力服用國貨啊丨</p>
<h3>國貨運動和我們的覺悟</h3>
<p>— 郭寅生</p>
<p>在這生產落後，社會經濟發生了動搖的不景氣中，一般人早感覺到非提倡國貨，無以挽救時艱。可是爲着「積重難返」的原故，非的一個偉大的運動丨國貨運動丨，難以矯正丨</p>
<p>在前天偶然看到某報斷片的紀載，稱「大學生和銀行行員是舶來品的推銷最力者」；做大學生的我，看了這段的說話，感覺到十分的愧報丨的確，這是無可諱言的事實。任你高聲呐喊，冷刺熱　，總呌不醒我們這號稱「智識階級」的大學生，丨却未必個個如此丨當然足以杞憂丨</p>
<p>就我們的服裝而論，似乎每人總得要備套西裝，才足以表現自己是個大學生階級丨可是在這種「只認衣衫不認人」的現實社會上，的確有「不得不然」的苦衷（？）所以我并不反對穿西裝，然而爲什麽不用國貨做原料呢？并且往往還要到外國商店去製呢？丨這眞是百思不得其餘的疑資了丨</p>
<p>至於其他的生活，却未必人人歐化丨可是我總希望我們大學生，可以用國產替代的東西，似不必一定去用舶來品。</p>
<p>本來「儉約運動」和「國貨運動」，是兩件事實，是兩重的意義。「儉約」是絶對屏除不良的奢侈，以節省經濟。「提倡國貨」却在防止利權外溢，而發展國家的經濟。不過其中也有聯帶的關係。</p>
<p>我們靑年能養成「儉樸」的美德更好，縱不然，奢侈也要有相當限度，尤宜在國貨範圍之内活躍丨須知從多數方面觀察，做個大學生，確實是難能的，那末我們應如何體貼家庭？如何使我們生活切合實際的環境，及如何顧念民生問題的嚴重？</p>
<p>「提倡國貨」的理論，我們大學生諒也「知之甚讅」，不過我最後進一言「希望大家覺悟起來，依照理論，實地做去丨」</p>
<p>「中國人應用中國貨」丨</p>
<p>「智識階級要以身作則」丨</p>
<h3>夏令實用的棉織品</h3>
<p>— 年</p>
<p>毛巾被　在這様熱的天氣，夜間最容易受寒，爲防範計，必須設置輕柔之毛巾被；此物外貨雖少，但國貨中往往有偷工减料之出品銷售，故愛用國貨者，以直接向出售廠家購買爲是。</p>
<p>棕棚套　睡覺是人生不可少的休息如因被臭蟲纒繞不淸而致失眠，最爲痛苦，除使用臭蟲葉水外，棕棚套是不可缺少的。</p>
<p>浴　具　外人常年每日洗浴，吾人雖不能及，然在此天熱的三月中，亦須每日洗之，以去汗汚，以防疾病，洗浴必須用浴具，如浴手套擦背帶大毛巾等，以得摩擦全身使其紅潤。</p>
<p>篇幅有限不再多述，願各家庭中置辦履行，則疾病或能减少一二也。</p>
<h3>寄語四言</h3>
<p>— 金以熙</p>
<p>在下是農村敎育同志的一員，負有指導農民的責任，曾召集過十幾個農友，在校裏談話，對於倡用國貨一問題，大都以爲「國貨的品質，不及洋貨來得精美；而且價値反高出於洋貨。」因此國貨對農友，信仰上受了打擊，這是很危險的。雖然也有許多的國貨在進步，可是事實上還須亟待精進，達到倡用國貨丨尤以布匹，要深入農村，因寄語四言，以告吾國貨工商界諸先生，那四言就是：</p>
<p>「努力工作益求精，</p>
<p>出品優良大家評，</p>
<p>價廉物美人人要，</p>
<p>國貨產銷自然靈」。</p>
<p>不知工商界諸先生以爲何如？</p>
<h3>國貨年中的呼聲</h3>
<p>— 許難公</p>
<p>荏苒的光陰將消逝了國貨年的一半，幾個月的時期果然很短促，但國人們對於國貨的認識，有了怎様的成績？說來眞使人痛心丨我敢以大膽的說一句，除了報紙上的宣揚和一部份國人的搖旗呐喊之外，實質上對於國貨未見有都大的進展，我們可以在每月進口洋貨的數量上證明這是事實，尤其明顯的是在街頭巷尾隨地可見的一般摩登男女，靑年學子依然穿戴着簇新的洋貨服裝，招搖過巿，許多的店舗裏還是陳列着各種的外貨，這様的情勢之下，國貨確實很少擴展</p>
<p>也許這是我們的劣根性，每次外侮的侵襲受了帝國主義者的欺凌宰割的時候，接着終有一番慷慨激昂的愛國運動，而這種運動也就是一種形式上的舉動，喊口號，貼標語，發宣言，作一陣子咆哮狂跳，但過了一個時期熱度也隨了時日而低降，至於烟消雲散，實際上是沒有什麽效能，更無傷侵略者的分毫，並不是我的吹毛求疵，過去鐵一般的事實横在我們的眼前，幾次的抵制劣貨，對日經濟絶交，初則興高彩烈莫不氣憤塡膺，嚴厲執行，繼而興盡氣絶意態消沉，因爲奸人的於中取利和國人的沒有恒久心，結果抵制的收獲反而助長了劣貨的猖狂丨</p>
<p>失敗爲成功之母，這是句至理明言的古訓，過去的經騐告訴我們，以前的失敗是繫於國貨的缺少，沒有國產品的替代，所以現在我們要改變方略從事於國貨的培養，以喊口號貼標語的精力來創造國產，唯國貨是用，愛護國貨爲各個國人的標的，也是每個國人的坐右銘，我們要創立一個自給自用的國家，因爲這様才能步入富强之途，背此則是條絶路丨</p>
<p>寫到這裏我不禁欲高聲底大呼一下，負有領導羣衆社會中堅的智識階級們丨你們不要儘在那裏沉醉於燈紅酒緑中，迷戀於爵士歌聲裏聽明的高唱着娱樂救國，尤其是這様勞神傷財無補於事的做着倒不如穿一件國貨衣服來得切實些啊丨</p>

<h3>靑島國貨展覽會開幕前奏</h3>
<p>— 玄萬</p>
<p>國貨年中的一大節目，我們的華北商業大埠，同時又是著名的仇貨傾銷區丨靑島，在這火傘高張下，旗幟飄揚，一個盛大的國貨展覽會，將就在這裏，巍然開幕，（七月十日）事前我們滬上各大國貨廠商的踴躍參加，搜集齊備，蔚爲巨觀，而國貨界鉅子潘仰堯，方劍閣，方液仙，任士剛等亦親自前往，躬臨指導，各挾着精美的國貨，負起重大的使命，不辭炎署，跋涉千里，努力進行，以共同造成此國貨史上光榮的一頁，這又是多麽値得我們的欽佩，不過，這次展覽會的情形不同，　異尋常，大槪應有下列幾條的注意，作我們這次乘風破浪丨壯舉的原則：</p>
<p>㈠對於外界應有的宣傳　靑島旣是仇貨傾銷的區域，一般人民平素昧於便宜的心理，反將自己的國貨摒棄不用，這次我們勇敢的前去，正應作一度努力宣傳，務使矯正他們以前的陋習，澈悟他們以後的愛國，而我們自己的貨物，自然亦均須特别低廉，不惜犧牲，以宣傳爲前提，發揚展覽會的眞意義。</p>
<p>㈠對於内部應有的置　我們歷來的展覽會，大都似乎均輒蹈過分草率之病，但這次却不然，靑島爲有名的避署勝地，氣候凉爽，在這時候，冠蓋如雲，遊人如織，並聞華北運動會亦將於該地開幕，一番盛况，當可預期，那慶我們亦正當竭其所力，精緻佈置，試思在此偉大之展覽會中，其來賓之爲如何龐雜，而我們必須使之人人滿意，同聲贊揚，賓至如歸，庶幾逹到此行之目的。</p>
<p>還有一點，這是最重也是最煩複的事，就是我們歷來的展覽會，輒以結束爲終點，換言之就是一個展覽會的閉幕後，對於該地不再加以繼續的努力，其實，這是錯誤的，現在我們在靑島國貨展覽會休會的時候，急應與當地販賣商或該地人民團體，成立互約，可繼續向滬上國貨廠商，直接訂購，最近聽說滬·靑國貨界領袖，將有聯合設立『靑島國貨公司』之組織，那麽自然再好沒有了。</p>
<h3>可喜的一幕</h3>
<p>— 愛余</p>
<p>我時常聽到這種嘆息：「外貨的忠實顧客，要推摩登少女了！」的確，這是無呆諱言的事實。只要你抽些時間到洋貨店前去站一下，就可證實這句話的不虚。可是，這是　們丨摩登少女丨的本心嗎？我敢說决不是的，沒有親信的人去開導她們罷了。不信，請看後面記實的一幕：</p>

<p>摩登姑娘麗珠！女</p>
<p>幕啓　老太婆在廳上手支着頣像沈　　思着什麽，麗珠旗袍革履手　　挾小包從外面進來。</p>
<p>女（將手中包解開給母親看）　媽媽！我　　今天買到了一匹便宜的ＸＸ紗，有　　一件旗袍的料作；你看。</p>
<p>母　啊！多少錢？</p>
<p>女　不過五元多一點。</p>
<p>母　唉！你們的口氣眞大，五六多一點　　還是不過；嘿！</p>
<p>女　不然要八九元呢，不是便宜了三塊　　錢嗎？</p>
<p>母　（指着她自己身上的本廠布做的衣服　　，眼望着她的女兒）便宜嗎？我身　　上的衣衫褲子，有五塊多錢，可做　　兩三套呢！又便宜又牢，你怎麽不　　歡喜？</p>
<p>女　你們年紀大的着着還好，我們眞着　　不出。</p>
<p>母（微怒）着不出？我先前還沒現在這　　様整齊，怎麽你的你親也愛我的？　　你們開口閉口總是新人物舊人物的　　，我眞不解，對着人家喊什麽提倡　　國貨，服用國貨，自己却拿金錢拚　　命的向外送。我們老腐敗可看不起　　。飛機大砲的恐怖，忘記了嗎？</p>
<p>女（漸醒狀，終於眼涙充滿了眼眶）媽　　媽！我醒了！我醒了！我的心我的　　罪，只有媽媽知道，我决不再買外　　貨了。</p>
<p>母（微笑）好！我的孩兒！要堅决地牢　　記着！</p>
<h3>中國國貨公司在今日</h3>
<p>— 丁杏</p>
<p>中國人最切要的需要是什麽？頭腦淸醒的人，當然都知道是：「服用國貨」，這是已經成爲普遍的口號了，在這急切需要之中，中國國貨公司却應運而生，　然不過幾個月的歷程，可是却已印入了一般人的腦筋，這正是一個緊要的時會，就是一般人希望它，扶助它，務使一定要使它逹到更美備，更精密的一個國貨公司，它們也很知自勉，所以在籌備多時之後的南部巿場，現地正式開幕了。</p>
<p>它們所發售的，應時代的需要，對於貨品的選擇，是煞費苦心，我且分開來把它略爲一說吧！</p>
<p>關於「衣」一方面的丨</p>
<p>綢緞部的：彩條二喬其，各色條子喬其紗，新花明妃紗，槳印各色美麗花雙縐，柳影縐，······以及其他各種雲紗，杭羅等，都適合現時代人們的需要，布疋部，也很多特緻的衣料，而且是不退色，一般靑年很喜歡，它的淡色，年老的是很喜歡它樸實的色調，服裝部是專爲一般人的新裝設計，尤以兒童服裝未得美備，雙縐的也有，府綢的也有，麻紗的也有，至於式様，更多得不可勝數，棉織品部的珠羅紗帳，是夏令禦蚊的妙品，浴衣浴巾，人人更不可少，婦女飾物部的夏令手袋，圖案新穎，頗覺精妙，雀毛扇的臨微拂，很能引人入勝，花邊部的白色紗邊，價錢旣便宜，質料又優美，鞋帽部的新派草帽，時式皮鞋。是夏令必要的東西，化裝品部的各種花露水，爽身粉，香水，香皂等，都是名廠出品，人人樂用，他如顧繡，手帕，内衣，襪子····等部，都是與我們有密切關係的，</p>
<p>關於「食」一方面的！</p>
<p>有貨部的山珍海味，也說不盡它的品名，簡單說一句，是無論誰都喜歡來買它的，寗式茶食，做得十分的道地，而且還有重淋堅燭，雖然是古老一些，但是不失東方的本色，所以它們也决意製造了來供應，土產部的各地食品，遠至雲南川貴北平天津，近至蘇常鎭揚杭嘉湖紹，都有特鮮之品，按日運到，火腿部精選的上蔣雪芳，色味俱佳，糖果罐頭二部的花色，更多鮮美之品，果子露，蜜橘汁，爲人稱道，烟酒部的白蘭地，惠司格，夏令飲之，極爲相宜，茶葉部的名山出品，水果部的應時鮮果，飲食部的氷雪冷飲，西式茶點，都是人人所歡迎的。</p>

<p>在已採的精密組織之下，它們還在力求精進，那麽未來的前程，更是不可限量了！</p>
<h3>夏令護膚香品</h3>
<p>— 笑蘋</p>
<p>我常常想：夏天可以算是一個腐化的時令，因爲各種東西到了夏天，都很容易腐敗，就是人們也要從身上發出一種刺鼻的汗氣來！所以我們在這可厭的夏天，對於皮膚的衛生，不能不特别注重。</p>
<p>每天洗浴，可以袪除身上的汗氣。但浴後皮孔開張，一受風吹就要成傷風感冒等病。如果你能在浴後用五洲藥房出的「五洲爽身粉」撲擦全身，那不但可以使皮膚康健細嫩，並且從身上會發出一種淸幽的香氣來，使人歡喜！還有「五洲花露水，」氣味芬芳，價値經濟，每日洒用，可以抵禦穢氣，解毒止癢，都是夏令家家必備的著名國貨呢。</p>
<p>現代工廠，不論其規模之大小，資金之多寡；欲覘其將來發展之程度，全視主持者能否改善其工廠之安全設備以爲斷。故目光違大之企業家，對於工廠機械之安全問題，莫不特加注意。蓋工廠中各部機器，偶不經心，易釀慘劇；欲免此弊，必須於馬達及皮帶之旁，預爲防範，右圖所示，即此種安全裝置。法以鐵絲網保護馬達及皮帶之四周，如遇機件損壞，不致危及職工之生命，，凡我國貨工廠，亟應設法裝置，亦維護工廠安全之一道也。</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<h3>我談「墮民」</h3>
<p>— 客</p>
<p>在六月二十九日的「自由談」裏，唐　先生曾經講到浙東的墮民，並且據「墮民猥談」之說，以爲是宋將焦光　的部屬，因爲降金，爲時人所不　，至明太祖，乃　其門曰「丐户」，此後他們遂在悲苦和截人輕蔑的環境下過着日子。</p>
<p>我生於紹興，墮民是幼小時候所常見的人，也從你老的口頭，聽到過同様的他們的所以成爲墮民的緣起。但後來我懹疑了。因爲我想，明太祖對於元朝，尙且不肯放肆，他是决不會來管隔一朝的降金的宋；况且看他們的職業，分明還有「敎坊」或「樂户」的餘痕，所以他們的祖先，倒是明初的反抗洪武和永樂皇帝的忠臣義士也說不定。還有一層，是好人的子孫會吃苦，賣國者的子孫却未必變成墮民的，舉出最近便的例子來，則岳飛的後　還杭州着守岳王填，可是過着很窮苦慘悲的生活，然而秦槍，嚴嵩···的後人呢？·····</p>
<p>不過我現在並不想翻這様的陳年賬。我只要說，在紹興的墮民，是一種已經解放了的奴才，這解放就在　正扩年間罷，也說不定。所以他們是已經都有别的織業的了，自然是賤業。男的是收舊貨，賣雞毛，捉靑蛙，做戲；女的則每逢過年過節，到她所認爲主人的家裏去道喜，有慶弔事情就帮忙，在這里還留着奴才的皮毛，但事畢便走，而且有頗多的犒賞，就可見是曾經解放過的了。</p>
<p>每一家墮民所走的主人家，是有一定的，不能隨便走；婆婆死了，就使兒媳婦去，傳給後代，恰如遺產的一般；必須非常貧窮，將走動的權利賣給了别人，這才和舊主人斷絶了關係。假使你無端呌她不要來了，那就是等於給與她重大的侮辱。我還記得民國革命之後，我的母親對一個墮民的女人說，一以後我們都一様了，你們可以不要來了。」不料她却勃然變色，憤憤的回答道：「你說的是什麽話？····我們是千年萬代，要走下去的！</p>
<p>就是爲了一點點犒賞，不但安於做奴才，而且要做更廣泛的奴才，還得出錢去買做奴才的權利，這是墮民以外的自由人所萬想不到的罷。</p>
<h3>讀書瑣記</h3>
<p>— 小雪</p>
<p>㈢「北國之春」，是王統照寫的一部散記，叙述他在九一八之前的半年的東北生活。全書雖然相當的展開了一些東北的情形，究竟是浮面的，範圍也很狹隘。總結我的意見，約有三點。第一，作者沒有很好的展開東北的廣大的民衆生活。第二，作者看到了東北社會的一些總缺點，但不能本質的去看。第三，作者不能從經濟的觀點，說明日本帝國主義與東北的關係，祇是暴露了部分的他們的殘暴行爲。這部書，在實際上還只是一部以個人爲中心，說明一些圍繞在自已周圍的人和事的書。</p>
<p>在二十篇散記之中，寫得比較成功的是「老人」與「詩話」兩章。「老人」寫一個農民。「詩話」寫一個農民出身的校役。兩個人的描寫中，充分的說明了東北農民的富革命性的，直率的，强悍的性格。「老人」是更顯然的叙述了日本以及舊俄羅斯如何直接的，不斷的，對農民加以迫害。他的妻子，在產後受了氷凉，和嬰兒一同死去；他的兩個大孩子，被舊俄羅斯在日俄戰爭時牽去運子彈，死了；他的女孩，被幾個「外國兵」輪奸死了；他自己也因此受了傷。可是，他一點也不屈服·「鑽山跑馬，挖參打架，做　子手，殺人報仇」如此的生活了二十年。從這些地方，使我們很易於想到，在九一八以後，日本帝國主義，對民衆義勇軍束手無策，不能消滅的原因······</p>
<p>作者的觀點，很明白的表示了一種無政府主義的人道主義的傾向，就在「老人」「詩話」兩篇中，也可以着得出來。在「紅日旗的車中」一篇的神話裏，更是正面的說明了自己的思想。他說：「界限與疆域是人間的自造之孽，在我，根本上認爲何必有此差别。我不是甚麽······ｉｓｔ向來不知一定不移的要向甚麽ｔｓｍ下府首情願。因爲這明明是人造的界限綫；即就學術文藝上看去，派别與主張當然有的，然而那只是批評者的利便的描圖，研究，創作的人何嘗一定先弄起個十分淸晰的　子將自己套入。時代固然能變更了人的興感與思想，但此中究竟有個性的濁流，所作「超時間區别的價値，」也就在此一點。···總之，人間的界限將一切害得太苦，造孽自多一。研究這一部書以及這一個作者的時候，這様的一些自白的地方，很重要的材料，不能忽略的。</p>
<p>㈣過去的詩人，早已有「百無一用是書生」的憤語，「社會與敎育」初刋時，葉紹鈞等也有學問無用的感想，連續的作了很多的論文。</p>
<p>在「北國之春」，王統照有這様的一段自白：</p>
<p>像我們甚麽事不能幹，藉了口與筆　　在社會中虚浮的度日，終日裏嚷着　　，想着些微細的事物，搆圖，或者　　披覽整理，複述些新舊書籍，這些　　乏味的動作，究竟於人的本分上能　　盡了許多？能否補益有助於我們的　　兄弟？我們誠實的回想，至少我自　　己眞覺得黯然，感到文人的空虚可　　愧！相形之下，我們何嘗及得上一　　個築路的工人，與收耯的農夫。（　　夜話）</p>
<p>這可以說又是一篇「學問無用論」，在黑暗時代一部份小資產階級智識份子的悲哀；其實，如果能夠跟着時代走，學問何嘗無用，許多偉大的思想家，就是好例。</p>
<h3>說實話</h3>
<p>— 唐弢</p>
<p>周作人先生在他知堂文集的序言裏，保證自己所說的都是實話，使我發生以下的感想。</p>
<p>如今這個時代，正是政治史上所稱爲Ｄｅｃａｄｅｎｃｅ的時代；一切都在　睡似的暮氣中。文人生在這個年頭兒，如果不是聾啞瞎，對着現狀不免要多幾句嘴。然這正如魯迅先生所說：「搔着癢處的時候少，碰着痛處的時候多。」</p>
<p>於是說話的難處也就來了。咱們中國素以寛厚聞名，何况六經八　，業經提倡，說話裏碰着别人的痛處，豈不是有背忠恕之道！文人讀孔孟之書，理應　得這一層，而偏要倔頭倔腦的說甚麽實話，大有「明知故犯」之嬚。</p>
<p>况且文人所說的實話，倒底靠不大住。俗語說得好，「小孩子口裏討實話」；旣會搖筆桿寫文章，其已非小孩可知。而且文人的腦子據說比常人敏銳，這種過度的雙感往往但他們把猪血當做人血；總一切度革命事亂份子　　做安　　；而我們勤猷紹著，愛黨愛國的該要人，反被　　一屍不値。這些說實話的文人，不免句句都是謊話。</p>
<p>至於文人們自己，也常你一句，我一句，隨後動起手來，校做一團，滚成一堆，雖打得頭破血流，也所不惜；　究其故，無非以爲自己所說的都是實話，而别人却句句揑造。由此推而廣之，世界自然多事；所以一切戰爭禍亂。都是文人爲之先召。如果從今以後，文人眞能緊閉尊口，一齊放下鋼筆，毛筆，鉛筆，自來水筆，不再說類似謊話的實話，使蒞臨者如入無人之境，則河淸海晏，黨國昇平，萬歲無疆！</p>
<h3>談温柔鄕</h3>
<p>— 何如</p>
<p>相傳漢成帝得御趙飛燕，覺其竟體如綿，無所不靡，謂爲温柔鄕。且曰：「吾老是鄕矣，不能效武皇帝更求白雲鄕也。」予幼時嘗讀醉鄕記，餓鄕記，睡鄕記諸文，頗以未見温柔鄕記爲恨。及讀金瓶梅卓二姐歸陰一段，寫卓二姐臨危時夢見溫柔鄕，雖寥寥數語，亦覺可喜，所謂慰情鄕勝無也。</p>
<p>卓二姐病在埀危，　思恍惚。西門　　慶出了大門，他便發起昏來，大聲　　疾呼道」這是怎的地方？爲何我身　　在此？」月娘李嬬兒聽得卓二姐狂　　　　　忙走到他房裏，喚醒了他，　　問他見些怎的？卓二姐道：「··　　飄一處，據臺金碧，柳暗花明，好　　鳥臨風而歌，作婉　之歡聲。　下　　海棠　　，飄柔絲以撩人，顧曰溫　　柔鄕。入其中，但聞簽管容　，歌　　聲裂帛。」月娘道：「歌些怎的？」　　卓二姐道：「只聽得首座一人歌曰　　·美色鹽中緑，美味魚中毒。可憐　　世上人，盡墮銷魂獄丨第二人歌曰　　，蓮炬融融春風溫，迷香洞中儘迷　　魂，黄金費盡歌舞空，十年一覺揚　　州夢。」···月娘道：「這也奇怪　　，想是你神思恍惚，就見了這些。　　······」</p>
<p>此之所謂溫柔鄕，何酷似今之所謂跳舞塲也丨在舊時封建社會中，眞能享溫柔鄕之樂者，上自漢成帝一流之君主，下至西門慶一流之豪紳，而貧苦小民莫與焉。倘今世而有溫柔鄕存在，則其享樂者又爲何許人耶？</p>

<h3>平凡的事（三）</h3>
<p>— 𣽃果孫</p>
<p>在我們所說的那個冬季的某天夜裘，他在那張黨看緑呢的長桌子上面下了四五回賭注之後，忽然看見封面有一個二十二三歲的漂亮女客向他招呼，他立刻機機似地應了一下；接著他望着她思索了一回兒，覺得那副單眼皮兒的蛋圓式的面磨兒，的確很有幾分兒面善，然而竟想不起那是在那兒會過的。那女客大槪是明白了雍孫的意思，就豪爽地說：</p>
<p>『三少，有好幾年沒有看見了。』</p>
<p>這聲音在他聽來是那様熟透了的，就從本能作用回簽道：</p>
<p>『眞地不曉得有幾幾何何的日子！』</p>
<p>同桌子的那些男女女，有兩三個有都偷偷地望望他們，然而他們在這一言一語之後，就都很安閑地各自下各人的賭注。</p>
<p>第二天，他們又於相同的時間在相同的處所會面了，這時候雍孫才曉得那個女客就是他七八年前熟識過的一個長三妓女的妹子，從前名呌「冠蘭老五，」現在已經從了良，說是一個新興小政客的太太。</p>
<p>後來，他漸漸明白老五的生活了，她的丈夫壽子春已經爲了一件和「大不敬」相類的事出了政界，只在某一個半宫式的銀行裏面掛個虚銜，進欵當然遠沒有從前豐裕，然而老三自己却依舊天天非賭不行···某一天，她忽然向雍孫說：</p>
<p>『子春是你們伯唐大少爺的朋友呀！我現在應當改口喊你做老伯伯了。』</p>
<p>後來，老五就領着子春到「二百八十一號」來見雍孫了，從此雍孫的知交錄上，就添了子春這様一個半稱小姪半稱淸客様的人。　從追隨一天密。本來雍孫雖然年齡快到五十歲，不過依然是一個十日九不歸家的散馬籠頭，所以他和子孫會面的時間，遠不及他和淸客們會面的時間來得密，直到閘北開火，租界戒嚴，他的行樂的範圍受了相當的制裁，才有閑暇功夫能　每隔兩三天到伯唐家　來閑談半日，······</p>
<p>雍孫正在凝思之中，忽然，一個丫頭跑到屋子　來，說是廠襄的工友們要找東家談話。登時，這消息像是一顆落在天井襄的炸彈似地，呌屋子襄的人滿吃一驚！然而伯唐終於從容不迫走出去。</p>
<p>大衆都張耳聽着。伯唐對着電話說了幾個「可以」和「蠻好」，他們心　漸漸都安穩下來，後來，他的脚步，幾乎和他口襄的「明天再會」那四個字聲音，同時回到了屋子襄。雍孫丢開烟槍問：</p>
<p>『有甚麽事？』</p>
<p>『廠裘的工人，和我有話要談，』伯唐說，『他們舉了四個代表，明天早上來會我。』</p>

<h3>糧食</h3>
<p>現麥湧聲中</p>
<p>期粉麥都呈低落</p>
<p>粉巿上午開盤後、各月份又呈疲滯之勢、以洋麥報價、芝加哥無巿、坎麥小二角左右、而目下之粉銷、雖尙活絡、惟廠存亦豐、兼現小麥到源、步步旺暢、各廠方面、依然一致看小、對於近遠各期、均有抛出、外行多頭、雖亦有購進、但環境不順、終被壓抑、較之前日收價、計落一分外、迨至下午開盤、曾見小面、本月份低至七分半、八月份至三角、後以北帮方面、傳逆軍已有辦法、不免辦胃活動、大廠亦有裝出待售、故各月份似乎略形帶起、不過現麥低宜、已臻極點、此後如現銷不暢、仍難看定也、結果較前日小一分、八月份小一分二厘半、九月份小一分、十月份小七厘半、十一月份小一分二厘半、十二月份小一分半云、</p>
<p>麥巿上下午開盤後、各月份均一致呈平落之象以洋麥報價、美麥無巿、坎麥小二角左右、照此情形、人心自然趨疲、且以現麥之到源、目下實在旺暢、各廠去胃、則仍呆木、并傳無錫方面、日來平均到五六萬、去則不過一二萬包、此種情形、實爲多年所未見、所以標準局面、终難看定也、結果七月份較前日跌四分、八月份跌三分、九月份跌一分、十月份跌三分、十一月份跌二分、現麥情形、又趨暗淡、至到貨方面、又逹二萬包外、福新已停手、阜豐略有收進、惟亦祇揀高貨、中次只包不動、傳二三年未見之漢口麥、亦將有四千包進口、故現麥前途、實大有問題也、開崑山小麥三元六角、次至五角六分、雙鳳麥三元四角五六分、無　麥三元五角二分、揚州麥三元六角二分、　潼特高麥三元七角半、開四千餘包、由阜豐辦去、</p>
<h3>客秈浙化續活</h3>
<p>丨中次一律滯緊丨</p>
<p>昨日杜秈浙帮去化續活、閩帮亦有應酬、巿上湘　高米已枯、中次各米亦漸减少、來貨不旺、一經客帮暢辦、人心與巿面均見帶緊、但河下各尖及洋米有底之充足、望其價格上漲、亦頗不易、且客帮歡迎之高格各秈、則因到存兩乏、不能盡與暢辦、昨日售開各米除南京車秈外、均係中次貨、全日開出江西機晚次米三百二十包、價七元五六角、又機早大巿貨四百七十一包、價七元一角至七元、湖南　靖一千一百包、價六元六角六分至六元半、又次糙米二百包、價五元九角七分、南京機米五百包、價七元一角九分至七元一角、又糙米五百包、價六元三角、其中由福州辦去湖南的米及京糙五百多包、本街去湖南砶靖二百包、其餘均爲浙帮温台辦去云</p>
<h3>米巿到稀升一二角</h3>

<p>洋莊絲巿轉趨淸平　昨日絲巿轉趨淸平、白絲經無巿、祇成交搖經黄絲二十包、價仍平定、</p>
<h3>珍眉緑茶銷暢價漲</h3>
<p>昨日本埠洋莊茶巿、來路莊之珍眉緑茶、運銷摩洛哥之恊和·錦隆·怡和各大洋行、進意仍趨濃厚、屯溪·遂安·　縣等路貨、均因底貨稀薄、巿盤提漲三四元、婺源北鄕珍眉、昨杜德永興等行、繼續搜辦、價照屯莊製法之貨、均隨到隨銷、惟仍沿用蠟光及條子過粗者、不易銷售、其餘珠茶·針眉等項、高莊均一致趨漲、僅温州珍眉一項、因受日茶廉價辦銷影響、巿盤略爲見低云</p>
<h3>疋頭呢絨巿不振之主因</h3>
<p>歷來關稅增加後呢羢巿面、有一番振作、貨價當齊趨漲、交易亦因之而轉旺、同業中彼此吸收者亦甚衆距今次適得其反、從新關稅公佈實行以來、呢絨巿况依然疲弱不振屈指二個月中之趨勢、除雨衣布略有上升一二角外、卽若銷路暢旺之素色　嘰亦反見疲跌、躉批交易、實際上非常希尠、考其不振之主因、蓋以加稅適値赤日炎天、呢絨營業正在淸淡之際、買方需要當然寥寥、類率束手、抱揥傍觀態度、因之交易無而執貨者、心思已慌、貨價遂難以喊高、一方面日貨復活動傾銷、暗中又受打擊、兼之國内時局不靖、銀根暗緊、再加下半年呢絨到貨擁擠、定貨號多自相担憂、皆願將老貨首先脫手、易銀付稅餉、翻進新貨、巿面隨之而不能進展、計麥爾登新貨納稅、平均每碼須付洋一元餘、而巿上現售老貨、普通牌子每碼祇售洋二元半、交易尙少、蓋買賣雙方明悉關稅激增、成本突高、老貨售價便宜、但均未敢嘗試吸收、（按往昔有此機會、内外有資者多紛紛吸收之）其巿面之　、可見一斑矣</p>
<h3>五金靑鉛暗盤鬆動</h3>
<p>靑鉛近來交易、頗有滯遲不前之勢、如向所暢銷之黄丹廠、油漆公司以及錫紙廠等、近來均因實銷不動、生意大减、出口帮若天津·烟台·漢口·福建諸帮亦少採辦、是以巿上買賣十分冷落、行情方面因人心之恐慌、頗有急圖脫手之勢、而暗步鬆動之象則已爲不可掩飾之事實、昨巿花旗鉛每担開十六元七角、比前跌去一角、印度鉛十六元九角、亦降小半角、坎拿大鉛售十六元八角、比前雖尙無變動、而一種鬆軟之象、則已非昔比矣、聞海外定價雖仍在激增、現每噸要三十五元之譜、惟連日美淮奇鬆、合之成本依然低廉、因此欲巿面之回漲、恐一時殊不易回好也</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>談抽烟</h3>
<p>— 潔心</p>
<p>都巿的生活，能使人們精神麻木，那末所需要的是刺擊和調劑，聽說「抽烟」是最能調劑精神興奮神經的好方法，所以好些人都便去抽烟，</p>
<p>講到烟，烟的種類是很多的，除旱烟，水烟，香烟，雪茄烟，還有鴉片烟，前兩種烟，雖是時代的趾遺物，在我們大都巿上海，大槪是滅了種，而在那些破落的鄕村裏，許多男女的黄皮骨瘦的勞働者，在閒餘生活的時候，手裏仍是人各一根，</p>
<p>雪茄除幾位坐道奇轎車，住洋房的大腹賈，和一般資產階級外，其餘多不許問津，若一榻横陳，飄飄欲仙的鴉烟，亦只有幾個幾身修到命裏注定得享淸福的朋友，才得享受，其餘只有呑呑土皮，吃吃三頭水，也算過了他們的老癮，這幾種人多是例外，我且不談，</p>
<p>惟有香烟，眞如和普及敎育一様，上而至於老爺，太太，小姐們，所吃的三九牌，茄立克，下而至於吃磕頭牌的小　三，莫不人手一枝，呑雲吐霧，還有未曾成年的靑年，亦每多此種嗜好，學校臥室之中，各色各様的香烟匣子狼籍滿地，若上課時不御香烟，已算該學生留得敎員們一些體面，十分道地，</p>
<p>還有拖黄包車的幾位老槍，拿汗血博取的金錢，今天的飯局，不曾打算，而口内的香烟，就在拉車的時候，亦大有非吃不可之勢，其餘如坐在路傍的男女吃丐，或是賣小糖的江北老太婆，假使不吃香烟，恐「太太老爺們做做好事」的口調，也打起來，所以亦非吃不可，</p>
<p>哎丨烟丨烟丨害人的烟</p>
<h3>一篇馬路賬</h3>
<p>— 幻奕</p>
<p>從大玻璃櫉射出了的濃烈的電光裏，反映出行人道上來來往往每個人的苦樂憂鬰各色各様的表情。兩旁的肉屏風堵住了黑黝黝的柏油路，汽車，人力車，脚踏車，電車，以及運貨車，好似急流中的萍葉，順着狂潮般的來去淌着一。</p>
<p>『猪玀：你要死　？』這是汽車夫對黄包車夫唯一的警告。當然，這是劑分時代的兩種交通利器。毌怪乘汽車的要分外的傲慢了。</p>
<p>滿臉　子的印度巡捕，把住了交通燈的開關，支配着來往的車輛，在他尖銳的銀笛聲中，呌出了如血様的紅光，出盡了威風在馬路上横衝直撞的汽車，在這個時候，也不得不俯首貼耳地靜候着牠的命令；黄包車夫也借了一些紅燈的賜惠，伸長了脖子，喘息了幾口鬰結在胸口的冷氣。</p>
<p>萬頭鑽動的肉堆裏，斷斷續續地送出了三絃和胡琴聲，一片喝采聲中激起了唱戲者最後的賣力，雖然在二簧轉西皮的腔調中，告訴了我們他的嗓子已經破裂了。但，在唱完了一齣之第，他接着就發出凄凉嘶啞的音調，對聽衆說：『今天夜飯的錢還沒有到手，請求諸位老板帮帮塲面，再給我個賣力的機會』，於是胡琴聲又起了，像敲破毛竹筒的嗓子又接上了。</p>
<p>在水門汀的地上最醒目的點綴，要算流浪文人的地狀了。五步一尊，十步一位，彷彿朝山道上的善男信女般的跪倒着，英文，中文，隷書，楷書，草書。以及篆文，反字，···琳瑯滿目地在電炬底下，好比開個書法展覽大會，還有，寫出了一大段光榮的履歷，要人家知道他不是生出來就這様潦倒的，他以前也戴過科長局長營長團長一類的頭銜，至於灘開了一張中學或大學的畢業證書爲證據的，那已成爲一回司空見慣的事了。但他們每天的收獲呢？祇賺到了一般走過的文人雅士們，指摘他們的地狀通與不通，書法的受過訓練沒有？和筆力的挺秀與否吧了！</p>
<p>在馬路旁的姑娘們，專是在短短的距離内徘徊，墻壁灰般的粉，猪血般的胭脂，塗滿了她們紙灰色的面孔，個個充分地顯露着畸形發達的肉的引誘，可是我們見到她們旁邊站的老太婆，不時地向她們丢出一個個的白果眼，就很可以知道她們對於這種生活的凄慘悲苦了。伹是祇要有一個男子行近她們的身邊，她們一定要露出些勉强的笑容，急急忙忙的拖着他，『先生，去坐吧！』接着，一定有個老太婆跟着說：『我們的姑娘才從鄕下來，先生：同你做個媒』。表示她還是一個處女，至少要相信她，接客還不多的妓女。啊！處女的味兒，誰也不願放過的，但，我們假使願把頭腦靜一靜的話，那麽你一定很明白的領會到她笑聲背後的哭聲，『先生；請你救救吧！』</p>
<p>大世界的鑼鼓聲息了。遊客如潮水般的湧出。果然有許多人玩得笑逐顏開，興盡倦來的回家休息了。但是有一般人正懊傷着臉感到今天的生計絶望了。他們也感到社會經濟的不景氣，而影響到大世界遊客的口袋裏了。他們祇有在馬路上東西的亂竄期待着天明的到來，他們每天的盼望着明天新生活的來臨！丨然而明天呢？······</p>
<p>巡捕下差了。交通燈也休息了。在死一般沉寂的馬路上，祇有汽車是縱横無忌地做了深夜中之驕子。筆紅燈的大鐘的指針，正是在一分一則不停的過去，但天，究竟要過幾時才明呢？·····</p>

<h3>在女生宿舍裏</h3>
<p>— 少君</p>
<p>在女生宿舍裏。</p>
<p>房子是四　樓的最上一層，下面是圖書　，敎室，辦公處，那就是Ｘ大學的女生宿舍的所在。</p>
<p>外天，我得老王的介紹，（不，是帶領）　走進這　峨的四層樓丨丨女生宿舍。在那裏，有太太，有小姐，有老王的朋友丨有的說是老王的Ｓｗｅｅｔｈｅａｒｔ。那裏有法國香水，有Ｈａｚｅｌｉｅ雪花膏，有最好的胭脂，香粉····還有，還有高跟鞋，長統絲襪，露體書片，焚亞</p>
<p>房子裏住着四個人，一個蜜司方，是老王的朋友；一個蜜司章，是某某先生的夫人；一個蜜司應，是某某名門的小姐；還有一個蜜司歐陽，是Ｘ大學的校花，不，是皇后。她們全是摩登女郎，美麗，活潑，動人。</p>
<p>牀上，桌上，地上，全很零亂。巧克力糖，五香花生米，爪子大王，放在桌上，牀上。紙頭，瓜子殻，花生皮，散滿桌上，地上。還有墨水瓶，練習簿，講義，西廂記，紅樓夢，····全堆在桌上的一角，上面蒙着些灰塵。</p>
<p>一陣笑聲，突地傳進我的耳朶，是那様尖銳，那様宏亮，那様宛轉，像舞塲中的交響樂一様動人。這是老王的朋友蜜司方的笑聲。她做起摩登女郎特有的嬌態給老王看，笑了又看，看了又笑。老王回了她一個笑臉，房子裏全充滿笑聲，笑了一陣，又是一陣。</p>
<p>老王坐在蜜司方的牀上，蜜司方的臉對着老王，笑滴滴地。</p>
<p>「今天我想騎車」。聲音是尖尖的。</p>
<p>「你什麽時候學會了騎車」？</p>
<p>「還沒有純熟，才開始學的！」</p>
<p>「那一個敎你的？」</p>
<p>「蜜司脫陳！」</p>
<p>「陳···陳什麽？」</p>
<p>「········」</p>
<p>蜜司方笑，老王也笑。但我看老王的笑是很不自然的。</p>
<p>這幾句對話，我全聽得很淸楚。以後，還看到蜜司方很親蜜地對老王談了許多話，輕輕地，我可不知道他倆在談些什麽。</p>
<p>蜜司章，蜜司應，蜜司歐陽，全沉默着，房裏很寂靜。</p>
<p>在靜寂中，我站起。法國香水，二ａｚｅｌｎｒ雪花膏，高跟鞋，露體　片·····</p>
<p>又在我的眼上闪耀。</p>
<p>我慢慢地移着脚步，走近前面那張用墨寫的條子：</p>
<p>「人生原來是吃，吃！」</p>
<p>據說，這是蜜司章的手筆，那淸秀的，活潑的書法，眞可使我佩服。很明顯地她是一個享樂主義者。她看透了人生的意義與價値，她是一個楊朱的門徒。</p>
<p>再過去，又是一張墨寫的條子：</p>
<p>「人生原來是唉，唉！」</p>
<p>據說這是蜜司應的手筆，字也很娟秀，她是一個悲觀主義者，在四個人中，也許是她的環境最壞。</p>
<p>再走過去二步，又是一張：</p>
<p>「人生原來是哈，哈！」</p>
<p>這是蜜司歐陽的手筆，她是一個樂觀主義者，在四個人中，也許是她最樂觀。</p>
<p>至於蜜司方呢，就不曾看見過她寫的條子，也許她是不喜歡人家知道她的。如果要知道的話，那只的去問老王了。</p>
<p>房裏又是一陣笑聲，蜜司章，蜜司應，蜜司方，蜜司歐陽，全都站起來。這陣尖尖的，宛轉的笑聲，送我們出了女生宿舍。</p>

<h3>老關夢</h3>
<p>編輯先生：</p>
<p>我是一個六親無靠的靑年，一向是個茶葉店裏的店員；可是現在已經處於生死不能的境地了。自己想不出辦法來，請先生指敎一條去路。原因是前（即民國二十年）年在吳淞鎭的時候，蒙兩位萍水情深的朋友，借給我數百元之欵項，屬我自立一小小塲面，爲永久生活之計，免得依屬傳　，東奔西走。這兩位朋友，眞　算一片好心吧。我就在該鎭中新路開了一爿小小茶葉店；營業到也不惡，足能維持開支，不料「一二八」滬戰發生，奥淞全鎭，盡入砲火之中，我的店首先焚　於矮寇之手。於是回到故鄕去過　，一身以外，無長物矣。待戰事告終，來滬圖　機會，誰知直到今年二月間，　是　擱在人家那裏。至是我那兩位一片好心的朋友，因憐念我賦閒已久，復借以資　，囑我恢復舊業，以維生計。於是又在上海英租界大通路立一門面，營我舊業。詎知仍然一敗墮地；不得已，一面囑舍弟暫維現狀，一面我自己特返故鄕，籌措欵項，再來振興事業。無奈鄕村經濟，十分困難，到處都在鬧窮，對於我去要求的事，更不待言了。祇得仰天一嘆，唉！我無路可走矣！我惟有自殺一途了，竊思我是一個同様有四肢五官，粗通文字的靑年，上有年高的老母，下有同胞的弟妹，均無自活能力，是故仍留殘喘而掙扎着。但是我那兩位情若同胞的朋友，借給我的欵項，不是他們自己的，還是在他的友人處代我借來的。前後所借，不下千元；現在每月要解利洋十四元，又須解會洋十一元。但奄奄一息的店，業已閉歇，我自己分文不用，按月二十五元的利錢和會錢，向何處去尋呢。如仍去做茶葉店的店員，這個當兒，實在難找；即使找到的話，月薪也不過五六元。對於這兩層需要的付欵，如何處置？若設置之不問，良心上如何說得過呢？倘再懇求那兩位朋友帮忙到底的話，他們的負担已經不輕，况且他們目下的環境，也不如從前了，何能代我再加負担呢。若說去　一個按月有二三十元薪金的位置，此更難之又難。我的處境，實在生死不得，進退不能的地位。這個難題，請先生代我解决一下罷！并頌</p>

<h3>紅緑燈下（十九）</h3>
<p>— 禧林</p>
<p>（十二）婦女的驕心使她一定要把他從美子身邊奪過來。</p>
<p>他後悔和王化那厮一起到陳公館去，現在可把他辦刋物的計劃弄僵了。他尤其擔心王化在陳公館所放的大砲，假使聯絡不到百多個團體看怎麽辦呢？若被老陳看穿了，看我們怎拿得活動費到？嘿，王化這鬼矮子！</p>
<p>他走錯了回路還沒有曉得。忽然在對角衖堂裏轟出一大堆人來，馬路上的人發瘋似奔攏來，他便也好奇的走過去，於是他看見在人堆中可捉着一個人在地上，大家圍着在打，在踢，在踏。</p>
<p>「造哪，造哪，打死哪矮鬼！」大家一邊打一邊駡。石喬幾乎以爲是打王化矮鬼，仔細一看才曉得是一個ＸＸ矮鬼。一種激越的民族仇恨全在他一個人身上來發洩，他是早被打量了倒在地上，而打着踢着的人却仍然在打踢，有的甚至一邊打一邊笑起來，石喬也覺得很是痛快。站在後面的人漸漸湧開了，當幾個法國巡捕趕到時，連打踢的幾個人也一閃都逃匿了。</p>
<p>石喬免不了也已避開，轉了一條馬路的灣。</p>
<p>你看，只要我們肯再加力量鼓吹，激勵，民衆一定可以動員起來。你看，剛才他們捉到一個ＸＸ便衣隊的情形····他這様想着想着又結論到要辦刋物的事。由辦刋物的事又不由的　着衣袋裏的三張飯票子　只有三張了，只有三張了。</p>
<p>他走到　門　　看見　　　　在難　級五　木陽</p>
<p>「剛才有一個姓周的來看你！」美子喊住他。「他說請你到警備司令部去看看姓張的，說姓張的關在牢裏了。」</p>
<p>石喬對於張洪烈之下獄好像是意料着了的事，並不表示驚異，只是周紹平等到底到前線去過沒有。心裏倒十分懷疑。恰這時三姨太從樓上下來。</p>
<p>「喬哥，你幾天在那裏去來？」三姨太始終是副妖媚的笑臉，石喬對於這副笑臉好像重新感覺生疏，同時又覺得這副笑臉打開了他今天一早來的沉悶。他照例對於三姨太的話難於應答如流，總是楞着一雙似笑非笑的眼。</p>
<p>「來得正好，眞悶呢，陪我到法國花圍去走走！」三姨太也照例不必得到他的回答，要怎様便怎様的拉住石喬便走。</p>
<p>頭又在想什麽心事似的。他毅然地走到她的身邊；</p>
<p>「美子；這幾天可不要馬路上走，以免人家誤會你是日本的女奸細呢！」</p>
<p>美子都偷看着三姨太，婦女大都是小心翼翼的，她一眼看出三姨太那笑臉已沉落下去了。便再用眼光向石喬表示：「你去吧，我曉得了！」</p>

<h3>Ping-Tang Rail Line Opens Once Daily</h3>
<p>(Dalian) The detailed agreement between China and Japan regarding the withdrawal of troops from the Luan Dong war zone was signed here today. It involves the allocation of tasks such as patrolling by Chinese soldiers, the opening of the Bei Ning Railway after the Japanese army retreats to the Great Wall, and other matters. (5th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Xue Zhiheng and other committee members telegraphed from Dalian on the 4th, stating that railway negotiations were completed today. They said that there was no basis for the rumor of entrusted management, and the Japanese side had not proposed it. They requested that a correction be published. The main points discussed were the gradual takeover following the withdrawal of Japanese troops and various matters related to transportation coordination, which have been largely decided. (5th special dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Xue Zhiheng and others held several meetings in Dalian with Kita and Li Jichun. Today, Xue telegraphed Beiping, reporting that other issues were temporarily put aside. Regarding the reorganization of the puppet troops, Xue, in a private capacity, would contact Li Jichun and representatives of the Kwantung Army separately to negotiate the reorganization. The number of puppet troops has not yet been determined. The planned locations for stationing them are Qian'an and Lu Long counties, far from the railway. Joint transportation between the Bei Ning Railway and the puppet Fengshan Railway will also be discussed with Guan Duo, the puppet director of that railway, to reach a consensus. The Japanese side's demands, according to our side, will be left for future consultations to avoid affecting the current negotiations. (5th special dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The resumption of traffic on the Jin-Tang section of the Bei Ning Railway has been implemented. Qian Zongze, the director of the Bei Ning Railway Bureau, has reported the details of the traffic resumption negotiations to the Political Committee today. (5th special dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The issue of dealing with the puppet troops in Luan Dong is still under negotiation, but the content is complex and cannot be resolved in the short term. Therefore, our side has commissioned Xue Zhiheng and others to continue consultations in Dalian. Regarding the withdrawal of Japanese troops from various places, it is reported that the Japanese military attaché has officially notified our side that the majority of Japanese troops in the Luan Dong area have successively withdrawn to Korea and Jinzhou. The remaining few Japanese troops in that area will be completely withdrawn to the vicinity of Changchun within a week. Our side is specially requested to send personnel to take over. It is reported that the Japanese side wants to use the issue of the puppet army reorganization as a political demand, so they are asking for a high price at the negotiating table, with the intention of creating difficulties, which has slowed down the progress of the meeting. (5th special dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Bei Ning Railway between Beiping and Tangshan now operates once a day. All train services can be restored in the short term. (5th special dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The majority of the Japanese army on the front line has successively withdrawn to the Changchun line. A part of the 8th Division of Nishi and the Hattori Brigade are now retreating and gathering in the Jehol region, taking Chengde as the center. However, a small number of troops are still stationed in the Miyun area. In the Luan Dong area, the 6th Division of the Japanese army has withdrawn to outside Yuguan and is mostly gathered in Jinzhou. A part of the 10th Division is heading to the South Manchuria Railway line to be stationed. The remaining troops who fought on the Great Wall will be transferred back to their home country for replenishment. (5th special dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Tongzhou reports that the situation is as it was yesterday. The county government has sent people to the Jixian area to scout, but their report has not yet been received. Lutai reports that the puppet troops of Ninghe are still holding their positions east of Lutai and have not moved. Shunyi reports that when Huairou was previously occupied by the Japanese army, they appointed the Han traitor Tang Jidong as the county magistrate. After the ceasefire agreement was established, most of the Japanese army withdrew to Miyun. There are still forty to fifty Japanese soldiers stationed in the city to maintain order. Now those Japanese soldiers have been ordered to withdraw, leaving only Tang in the city. Bandits are taking the opportunity to cause disturbances, and the people are uneasy. (5th special dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) When the Bei Ning Railway train No. 7 passes through Tanggu every morning, five armed Japanese soldiers and one officer escort the train to Tangshan, intending to prevent the puppet army from misunderstanding the train. Then, the No. 10 train returns to Tanggu from Tangshan, and they get off. The Tangshan Telephone Bureau is still guarded by the puppet army. Long-distance telephone calls to Liaoning can be made from there, but not to Beiping or Tianjin. (5th special dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Railway news: The Ping-Tang section temporarily operates one train each for No. 7 and No. 10 daily. Because the tracks at Tangshan Station are congested with military vehicles, they are trying to clear them. It is expected that all passenger and freight trains can be restored by the 10th. Negotiations with the Japanese side have been very smooth in recent days. It is hoped that traffic can be restored to Yuguan in the shortest period. Currently, the Tangshan station is still under surveillance and management by the puppet army. (5th special dispatch)</p>
<p>(Dalian) Regarding the issue of reorganizing the puppet army discussed at the Dalian meeting, the Chinese representatives have received instructions from Huang Fu, so the meeting was reopened at 10:30 this morning. It seems that it has been largely decided to accommodate the demands of the puppet army. Therefore, Deputy Chief of Staff Okamura, Colonel Kita, and representatives of the Chinese side Lei Rongshou and Yin Jiong, as well as representatives of the puppet army, held a plenary meeting at the Dalian Military Police Detachment at 3:00 PM for final contact. (5th general dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The scope of the Dalian negotiations is limited to the reorganization of the puppet army. Other matters such as restoring transportation and guarding the railway will be based on the principle of not violating the Tanggu Agreement. Yesterday's report that the demands made by the Japanese side were finally turned around after the representatives' strong arguments. The issue of incorporating the puppet army can be determined after the fifth meeting again. The three committee members, Xue Zhiheng and others, are scheduled to return to Tianjin on the 6th. The reception meeting will wait until Xue and others arrive to report the negotiation process, and then discuss the implementation method. (5th Central News Agency dispatch)</p>
<h3>Haiqi and Two Other Warships Arrive in Guangdong</h3>
<p>Four Conditions Presented to Guangdong</p>
<p>Guangdong Authorities Not Permitted</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) The Haiqi and two other warships arrived at 8:00 AM on the 5th, 5 miles off the coast of Hong Kong's Henglan Lighthouse, heading southwest and proceeding directly to Guangzhou. (5th special dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The government believes that the disappearance of the Haiqi and two other warships is a complex situation. In addition to approving Shen Honglie's resignation, although no specific decision has been made on future handling methods, it is believed that the ships' departure from Qingdao was due to a momentary impulse and not a significant act of rebellion. The central government has telegraphed to persuade them to return to the team. The Northeast Navy has never been subject to central dispatch. Now it is planned to request the Beiping Military Branch to effectively reorganize and subordinate to the central government, while eliminating small warships and assigning commanders and captains by the central government to clarify the system. (5th special dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) The captain of the Fu'an warship, entrusted by the three Haiqi warships, presented four conditions to Guangdong: (1) Pay the three months of back pay owed when they were in the Northeast Fleet; (2) After arriving in Guangdong, pay them monthly according to the salary standard of the Maritime Department; (3) The officers and palace staff of each warship must not be changed; (4) Immediately issue departure fees to sail to Guangdong waters. However, the authorities believe that the demands are too extravagant and cannot be permitted. Moreover, the central government has ordered Chen Jitang to send planes to investigate their whereabouts, so the veteran faction has stopped contacting the escaped warships. (5th Central News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Chen Shaokuan discussed that the reason for the mutiny of the Bohai Fleet was that the fleet was not transferred under the central command, and the military power was not unified, leading to easy breakdown. After this mutiny, all handling will be presided over by the Military Commission. When the three warships passed through the Wenzhou waters and headed southwest, the headquarters did not dare to send warships to intercept them because they had not received orders from the Military Commission. According to the headquarters' radio report, the three warships passed Hong Kong at noon on the 5th and arrived in Guangzhou at 4:00 PM. (5th special dispatch)</p>
<p>(Guangzhou) The three Chinese mutiny warships that sailed out of Qingdao are still a mystery. This place is paying close attention to the actions and intentions of these three warships. Although there is news from Hong Kong that the three warships have arrived outside the port this morning and are heading southwest, the three warships have not yet arrived as of this afternoon. The authorities here have also not directly received any words from the three warships. (5th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<h3>Shen Honglie Resigns as Qingdao Mayor</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Shen Honglie's intention to leave is firm. He has sent his family to Beiping so that he can live in Beiping in the future. The position of Qingdao Mayor that he also held will also be resigned. The successor to the commander of the Northeast Navy has not yet been determined. Zeng Yiding, who was previously sent to Beiping by Chen Shaokuan, will go to Qingdao within a few days to investigate the Haiqi and two other warships. According to the Great Northern Telegraph Company report, they have sailed south from Wenzhou. However, this morning, the naval radio station suddenly received a telegram from the Haiqi and two other warships. Because the code was garbled, it was not easy to decipher. Based on the distance of the radio waves, it is estimated that the ships have not gone far. Zhao Xun, Li Ronglin, and Section Chief Wei Qigong, senior staff members sent by the Military Branch to Qingdao for investigation, arrived in Qingdao on the 4th and are negotiating everything with Shen. They are expected to return to Beiping within this week. (5th special dispatch)</p>
<p>(Qingdao) Ge Guangting, the chairman of the Jiaoji Railway Committee, returned to Qingdao from Jinan on the morning of the 5th and immediately went to the city government to meet with Shen Honglie to discuss the negotiations with the Koreans in Jinan. (5th special dispatch)</p>
<h3>Qingdao Various Circles Plan to Open a Civic Assembly</h3>
<p>(Qingdao) Because all previous methods to retain Shen have not worked, at 2:00 PM on the 5th, various circles held the first preparatory meeting for the Civic Assembly at the City Chamber of Commerce. 150-60 people attended, and Song Yuting was elected chairman. Three proposals were passed on the spot: (1) The Civic Assembly will be held at the Qiyan Hall on the 8th. On that day, all businesses and schools will close to participate; (2) The method of convening the Civic Assembly is to notify the citizens in the name of various groups; (3) Eight proposals will be submitted to the Civic Assembly for voting. The City Chamber of Commerce, Journalists Association, Lawyers Association, Bankers Association, and Teachers and Staff Union were publicly elected to be responsible for the wording and revision of the proposals. The meeting will continue on the 6th. (5th special dispatch)</p>
<h3>Song Zheyuan Actively Mediates the Chahar Incident</h3>
<p>The Central Government Still Hopes for a Peaceful Resolution</p>
<p>He Yingqin Calls Song and Pang for Talks</p>
<p>(Beiping) Song Zheyuan originally planned to go to Tianjin for treatment of his waist pain, but to avoid outside rumors, he decided to stop. Song returned to his residence after a walk somewhere this afternoon and invited Qin Dechun and others to discuss ways to resolve the Chahar incident. At the same time, he telegraphed Tianjin to urge Deng Zhexi to come to Beiping that night. After discussing the results, Deng will be sent back to Zhangjiakou to visit Feng Zuohua and make a final effort to mediate. It is believed here that Feng cannot effectively command and control the troops in Chahar. For example, Bao Gang's department has been reorganized by the Jin army. Zhang Renjie also has many gaps with Feng. The volunteers Deng Wen, Li Zhongyi, and others are mostly old subordinates of Ma Zhanshan and Su Bingwen and do not have a deep relationship with Feng. After Ma and Su come north, they will have to reorganize and reorganize the establishment. In the future, its internal organization will also automatically disintegrate. (5th special dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) There is no progress in the Chahar incident. Song Zheyuan and others are still trying to mediate. He Yingqin summoned Song and Pang for talks this afternoon. It is reported that the central government's reply telegram has arrived, and it still hopes for a peaceful resolution. Before proceeding, there must be a negotiation before waiting for a reply. The reply can be made for concrete progress. Because there is no hope in mediating the Chahar incident, Li Qi went to Tianjin yesterday to persuade Deng Zhexi to come to Beiping to work together. Deng is scheduled to come to Beiping tonight. (5th special dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) He Qiqiong is hosting a banquet tonight for all officers of the Song Department. (5th special dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Zhao Pilian telegraphed Xu Yongchang from Taiyuan today, planning to go to Hebian Village to visit Yan Xishan to report in detail to Yan on the central government's policy towards Chahar. He Zhuguo came to Beiping to visit He and report on defense. He returned to Yangcun defense sub-station after completing his official duties today. (5th special dispatch)</p>
<h3>Sun Dianying's Troops March to Qinghai on Foot</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Sun Dianying's troops are marching to Qinghai on foot. The Ping-Sui Railway is preparing ten trains to transport light and heavy equipment. (5th special dispatch)</p>
<h3>Regular Meeting of the Beiping Military Branch</h3>
<p>(Beiping) The Military Branch held a regular meeting this afternoon, chaired by He Yingqin. They discussed the issue of reducing military expenses for the various armies in North China after the end of the war. It is reported that the reduction standards have been agreed upon. The Chahar incident was also briefly discussed. (5th special dispatch)</p>
<h3>Supreme Court Investigates Yi Peiji Embezzlement Case</h3>
<p>(Beiping) The case of Yi Peiji, the former director of the Palace Museum, being impeached by the Control Yuan for embezzlement, was investigated by the Supreme Court of Nanjing a month ago. There is considerable evidence. Yi resigned and stayed in Shanghai. Because of the difficulty in carrying out the litigation in the Beiping District Court, the Supreme Court telegraphed the Beiping District Court the other day to transfer the case files to the Nanjing District Court for resolution. Yi will be severely punished. (5th special dispatch)</p>
<h3>Sino-Soviet Negotiations on the Sale of the Chinese Eastern Railway: Soviet Russia and the Puppet State in Direct Conflict</h3>
<p>Temporary Recess to Study Each Other's Proposals</p>
<p>Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs Blames Russia for Not Keeping Faith</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The fourth meeting of the Sino-Soviet negotiations on the sale of the Chinese Eastern Railway was held at 2:30 PM on the 5th. In addition to the representatives from the Soviet and Manchurian sides, the two Japanese representatives, Nishi and Suzuki, were also present. The Russian representative, Ambassador Lyubimov, first read a statement, arguing that the ownership of the Chinese Eastern Railway completely belonged to Russia based on past history and treaty relations. The Russian statement was like throwing a huge bomb. The representative of "Manchukuo," Ding Shiyuan, also read a statement refuting that, observing the state of Russia after the October Revolution and the Karakhan Declaration, the fact that Soviet Russia had abandoned its ownership was obvious. Therefore, the Russian side only had a very weak basis for co-management. Thus, the two sides began a heated discussion on the issue of ownership, leading to a direct conflict. As a result, it was decided that the two sides would exchange their statements to study each other's positions, determine their attitudes, and then discuss. The meeting adjourned at 7:00 PM. The meeting authorities issued a communique stating that at the fourth meeting, both sides issued statements. Both sides decided to study each other's statements, understand their contents, and then determine the date of the next meeting. (5th Japan United Press dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) After the Soviet Russian side issued a statement last night on the sale of the Chinese Eastern Railway, the "Manchukuo" delegation in Tokyo issued a declaration, stating the attitude of those who are being waited on in this matter, saying that "Manchukuo" is only prepared to buy the railway for 50 million Japanese yen. (5th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese side originally prohibited newspapers from publishing the issue of the selling price of the Chinese Eastern Railway, but since the Russian side unilaterally issued a statement, this prohibition has been automatically lifted. At today's meeting, "Manchukuo" was only willing to buy the Chinese Eastern Railway for 50 million Japanese yen and also required the Russian side to guarantee that the previous creditors of the railway would be responsible by the Russian side. However, the Soviet Russian government requested to sell the railway and all affiliated industries for 250 million gold rubles. The payment method was half in cash and half in goods. As for one-quarter of the cash portion, it must be paid immediately, and the remaining portion can be replaced with bonds. (5th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The fourth meeting on the transfer of the Chinese Eastern Railway is scheduled to be held at the residence of Vice-Minister Shigemitsu this afternoon at 2:30 PM, chaired by Ding Shiyuan. However, the transfer price and other claims between Russia and Manchuria that have already been proposed are very disparate. Although the formal order is to review the Soviet Russian proposal first, it is predicted that there will be considerable chaos at the start of the meeting. Therefore, the transfer negotiations will inevitably fall into a stalemate before entering substantive discussions. (5th Electric Communication dispatch)</p>
<h3>Soviet Russian Note</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Soviet Russian representative's note on the transfer of the Chinese Eastern Railway, proposed at the Chinese Eastern Railway meeting on the 3rd, was announced by the embassy yesterday. Its content is as follows: (1) The Soviet Russian government agrees to sell the Chinese Eastern Railway and affiliated property to "Manchukuo" in accordance with the Beijing and Fengtian Agreements. However, various Soviet Russian properties that do not belong to the Chinese Eastern Railway but were retained on the railway at the time of the negotiations, because the exchange of vehicles has not been carried out in accordance with the agreement, the remaining Soviet Russian properties on the railway are naturally not included in the sale. These properties should be returned to the Soviet Russian government. The determination of the property catalog should be carried out by a special committee. The following are listed for sale: (A) Main line 1,726 meters, auxiliary line 255,449 meters, telegraph line 2,576 meters; (B) Railway-affiliated locomotives, vehicles, and operating materials; (C) Railway and passenger buildings with a total area of 1,199,000 square meters, etc. (2) Because of the transfer of the Chinese Eastern Railway, the vested interests of the Soviet Russian side in various treaties have been eliminated, and some have greatly reduced value. (3) Discussing the significance of the Chinese Eastern Railway, it must be strongly argued as an important artery of Eurasian transportation. (4) Those who undermine the legitimate activities of the Chinese Eastern Railway are the special conditions that have recently occurred, which have temporarily worsened the financial situation. However, this cannot be confused with the substantive significance of the railway. (5th Electric Communication dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) There have been various rumors about the amount of money and the method of payment in the Soviet Russian proposal regarding the transfer of the North Manchurian Railway. The most reliable information now learned is as follows: (1) The transfer amount is 250 million gold rubles (each ruble is equivalent to 1.04 Japanese yen); (2) Payment method: The total amount is divided into two parts. 125 million gold rubles will be paid in commodities, with a term of two years and three payments per year. The other half, one-third in cash, will be paid immediately, and two-thirds will be paid in four years with an annual interest rate of 4%. (5th Electric Communication dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Russian Ambassador to Japan, Lyubimov, visited Foreign Minister Uchida at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at 4:30 PM on the 4th, hoping that Japan would provide good-faith assistance to the Chinese Eastern Railway sales negotiations and present the Russian side's views. The Foreign Minister replied that the solution to this problem would not only make the relations between Russia and Manchuria closer, but also be the key to establishing peace in the Far East. Therefore, although there are many difficulties in the future negotiations, they should observe the overall situation and strive to move towards the path of the establishment of the negotiations. (5th Japan United Press dispatch)</p>
<h3>The Puppet State's Proposal</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The content of the "Manchukuo" side's proposal on the transfer negotiations of the Chinese Eastern Railway is as follows: (1) The Soviet Russian side agrees to transfer all rights of the Chinese Eastern Railway and its ancillary business to "Manchukuo." "Manchukuo" agrees to pay a price of 50 million Japanese yen. The payment period and method will be determined separately. (2) Within one month from the date of signing this treaty, the "Manchukuo" government will appoint a committee to receive the Chinese Eastern Railway. Within three months from the date of signing, it will receive the Chinese Eastern Railway and its ancillary business, and all its affiliated properties. (3) The Soviet Russian government assumes full responsibility for all claims of shareholders, bondholders, and other creditors of the Chinese Eastern Railway before March 9, 1917. All debts from March 9 onwards until the treaty takes effect shall be borne by the Soviet Russian government. (4) The Soviet Russian government shall hand over the documents concerning the Chinese Eastern Railway and its ancillary business to "Manchukuo." (5) Other matters will be proposed separately. The reason for the proposal is that the current Chinese Eastern Railway is not only worthless, but will inevitably reduce its value after "Manchukuo" completes the railway in the future. The tracks of the Chinese Eastern Railway are now decayed, and even the platforms are outdated and have no value for use. If a new railway line is built, only 130 million Japanese yen will be needed to build it. Therefore, considering the current dilapidated state, it is only worth 65 million Japanese yen. The Soviet Russian ownership rights are calculated at half, which is actually only 32.5 million Japanese yen. As for all the debts of the Chinese Eastern Railway, the Soviet Russian side is responsible. At the same time, from the perspective of the political overall situation, 50 million Japanese yen is appropriate.</p>
<h3>Our Country's Opposition</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) After Soviet Russia resumed diplomatic relations with China, it suddenly proposed to Japan to sell the Chinese Eastern Railway. At first, it made various disguises, and then it explained with strong words, violating facts and legal principles. It ignored all the provisions stipulated in the Sino-Russian Agreement and did not give a reasonable reply to our second protest, causing Chinese public opinion, which had previously been warmly sympathetic to Soviet Russia, to change to a discourse of opposition, which is detrimental to the diplomatic relations and national feelings of the two countries. The current investigation reveals that there are no less than a thousand telegrams opposing Soviet Russia's sale of the Chinese Eastern Railway. (5th Central News Agency dispatch)</p>
<h3>France's Attention</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The French Ambassador to Japan, Count Maldelberg, visited Vice-Minister Shigemitsu at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at 11:30 AM today, asking the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to pay attention to the ongoing negotiations between Russia and Manchuria on the purchase of the North Manchurian Railway, saying that the railway has been invested by France from the beginning. He hoped that France's rights and interests would not be ignored at this time. Vice-Minister Shigemitsu replied that the Imperial Government was only acting as a facilitator for the negotiations, and that these types of rights and interests issues should be negotiated directly with the Soviet Russian government. The meeting ended at noon. (5th Electric Communication dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japan's Indignation</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Today, a spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs commented on the negotiations on the sale of the Chinese Eastern Railway, saying that the Russians are indeed better at profiting than the Manchurians. The Japanese government now intends to make every effort to ensure the successful completion of the Russian-Manchurian meeting. However, the Soviet side's failure to keep its promises and its sudden publication of a statement on the status of the Chinese Eastern Railway has indeed caused the Manchurian side to take a pessimistic view of the situation. "Manchukuo" is now willing to offer 50 million Japanese yen to purchase the Chinese Eastern Railway and its business, on the condition that the Soviet Russian side be responsible for dealing with any third-party claims against the railway. "Manchukuo" claims that it can now build a new road parallel to the Chinese Eastern Railway for 130 million Japanese yen. The Chinese Eastern Railway has been built for many years and is beyond repair. It is fair to pay half of this amount, 65 million yen. Moreover, the Soviet Russia and "Manchukuo" are both the owners of the road, and Soviet Russia should only get half of the 65 million yen. The Soviet Russian government is now asking for 250 million gold rubles, half in cash and half in goods. One-quarter of the cash must be paid immediately, and the rest will be paid with bonds.

<h3>Russia and Japan Accuse Each Other</h3>
<p>(Harbin) Russia and Japan are now accusing each other of being related to bandits, which hinders the progress of bandit suppression. The Japanese side claims that when the Japanese army recently suppressed bandits on the Chinese Eastern Railway, Russian officials often did not allow the Japanese army to borrow telephones and interfered with the Japanese army's telegraphs, causing the Japanese army's communication and news to be completely cut off from each other. The Russian side said that the Japanese army had secret agreements with the bandits to enable the bandits to disrupt the Chinese Eastern Railway's traffic. (5th Reuters dispatch)</p>

<h3>On the Accumulated Evils of the Study Abroad System</h3>
<p>— Bo</p>
<p>The summer break has arrived. Another academic year has come to an end. Among the university students of this period, there will again be some who, whether through public funding or private means, will ride the long winds and break through ten thousand miles of waves to study abroad in foreign lands. Given the decline of education, the decay of practical industries, the lack of scientific development, and the stagnation of culture in our country, it is with sincere joy and anticipation that we see these young students travel far to foreign lands to deepen their knowledge and prepare themselves for future use by the nation. However, if we take a look back at the facts of the past few years, we find that the majority of students returning from abroad do not necessarily acquire practical knowledge of any real value, nor do they necessarily make any contribution to our country. The best among them engage in the performance of foreign "eight-legged essays" that do not suit the national conditions, while the worst use their status as returned students to boast to relatives and friends, considering it a stepping stone to fame and fortune. They even form groups based on the countries where they studied, becoming factions that exclude each other and pursue their own selfish interests. This is why foreign "Hanlin scholars" (referring to returned students) receive more criticism than praise, and the merits of returned students do not compensate for their demerits. Originally, the purpose of young people studying abroad was to benefit the nation, but the results are minimal. Where does the crux of the problem lie? On the one hand, it lies in the inadequacy of the study abroad system, and on the other hand, it lies in the lack of self-awareness among the returned students themselves.</p>
<p>Looking at the young people in our country today who are able to study abroad with substantial funds, the majority are sons of wealthy families who inherit the legacy of their ancestors, and sons of powerful and influential relatives. The purpose of these two groups in studying abroad is often to admire the scenery of foreign countries and to pursue a life of pleasure. As for truly motivated and studious young people from poor families, they can only sigh with longing. As a result, those who study abroad do not study, or even if they do, their studies may not be suitable for practical application, while those who are determined to study are left with a sense of regret. How can we expect the nation to acquire useful talents in such a situation? This is a result of the lack of planning in sending students abroad. Secondly, private students going to France and America are given complete freedom, and public students are often not carefully selected. The national conditions of each country are different, and the forms of culture and art also vary. Precisely because of these differences, our country's dispatch of students to study abroad should take into account our country's shortcomings and needs, and a detailed and well-defined plan for sending students should be established first. However, looking at the so-called students studying abroad today, they themselves have no purpose, and the government has not been heard to have any plan. One batch of students is approved to return, and another batch is approved to go abroad. What did those who returned gain? What will those who go abroad do? No one has ever bothered to think about it. This is another failure due to the lack of objectives when sending students abroad.</p>
<p>Therefore, if we want to obtain good results from studying abroad today, the government and the students must abandon the accumulated evils of the past. Otherwise, if we continue with the old ways, we fear that we will ultimately be disappointed.</p>
<p>As the students are about to prepare for their departure, we have endless hopes, and therefore dare to briefly mention the accumulated evils of the past, to offer them to the government authorities and the students who are striving for the nation.</p>

<h3>The Atmosphere of Prolonging the London Economic Conference is Extremely Strong</h3>
<p>President Roosevelt's New Instructions to the Delegation</p>
<p>The Ultimate Success or Failure of the Conference Hinges on This</p>
<p>(London) US President is preparing a new declaration on US monetary policy in an attempt to salvage the conference. Whether this new declaration will meet the wishes of the gold standard countries, the US delegation cannot predict. However, there is now a new hope that a middle ground can be found between the two sides so that the economic group can continue the meeting. French Finance Minister Bonnet will also wait quietly for the new US declaration, but still admits to being pessimistic, stating that unless the dance of currency prices stops, there is no alternative but to adjourn the meeting. (4th National Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) After the meeting of the main committee members of the Economic Conference, the situation remained unchanged. They are now only waiting for President Roosevelt's new declaration. The gold standard countries still insist on the necessity of extending the conference. When the meeting of the main committee ended, US representative Hull had received President Roosevelt's new proposal and immediately presented it. The meeting was adjourned at 11:45 am to await Roosevelt's new declaration. It is now believed that Roosevelt's declaration particularly emphasizes the possibility of the Economic Conference proceeding with its work in the economic field. Roosevelt acknowledges the need for the monetary committee to be extended for several months, but advocates maintaining the work of the economic committee and its various subcommittees. People in the Economic Conference believe that Roosevelt's views contradict the opinions of most representatives in the Economic Committee, as most representatives believe that monetary and economic work must be carried out simultaneously. In addition, there is a rumor, which has not yet been proven, that Roosevelt proposed creating an international clearing unit, the mechanism of which is very complex. Some people in the Economic Conference's rest area believe that if this rumor is confirmed, this mechanism will require a considerable period of time to be sorted out and will not be finalized until the Economic Conference reopens. As to whether the Washington instructions will be issued immediately or will be presented at tomorrow's presidium meeting, the US delegation is still considering it. (5th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Frequent Transatlantic Telegraph and Telephone Communications</h3>
<p>(London) The exchange of telegrams between President Roosevelt and the US delegation has not yet ended. The delegations of other countries attending the Economic Conference are all waiting for the result. The US delegation received the first telegram from the US President at night, but according to the news currently coming out from the US delegation, the situation has not fully crystallized and a policy cannot be announced. Starting at 10:15 this morning, the US delegation began exchanging views with the US President, and the exchange of telegrams has not stopped until now. It is expected that negotiations on the continuation of the conference may reach a crucial point at 3:00 pm, at which time the US delegation may receive a call from the US President. It is heard that US Secretary of State Hull is currently in contact with British Prime Minister MacDonald and representatives of other countries separately. The first telegram from the US President is said to be explanatory in nature and not a direct stimulant for the conference, but it summarizes the situation and expresses optimism about the conference. The US delegation met for two and a half hours and dispersed at 12:45 pm. According to their opinions, the atmosphere seems to be gradually clearing. Although the US representatives have not yet notified others of the results of their discussions, they expressed the opinion that the atmosphere of the conference is now more friendly than yesterday. Professor Morley participated in this morning's meeting. The US delegation stated that there may not be a concrete statement issued in a few hours, because after receiving the US President's final instructions, the US delegation will discuss it with representatives of other countries, and then any proposal can be submitted to the main committee's meeting tomorrow.

<h3>US New Proposal Fails to Satisfy Gold Standard Countries</h3>
<p>(London) US President's new proposal to save the Economic Conference has failed to satisfy the gold standard countries of continental Europe. The adjournment of the conference is now clearly not a question.</p>
<p>After the US President's new proposal was informally distributed to the representatives, the steering committee of the main committee met this morning to discuss it. According to the results of its notification to the US Chief Representative, unless the US President can make more contributions, the best way to resolve the deadlock is to adjourn the meeting and leave several economic subcommittees to continue their work.</p>
<p>It is reported that the Geological Museum where today's meeting was held and the Claridge Hotel where the US delegation resides were both busy making final efforts to save the situation. However, after the steering committee meeting, which included the chairmen, vice-chairmen, and rapporteurs of the conference and the two major committees, the French Finance Minister spoke to reporters in a sarcastic tone, stating that "we were waiting for a telegram from President Roosevelt, which seemed to be able to change everything." Foreign Minister Simon was equally pessimistic, stating that the situation was extremely bad. At that time, the US delegation was gathered at its hotel, trying to avoid bearing the responsibility for the failure of the conference, frequently talking to Washington via transatlantic radio telephone and frequently contacting other delegations in London. It is heard that the US delegation will issue a declaration this afternoon to clarify the situation, reiterating that resolving the currency issue is not a fundamental priority in the other work of the conference, and advising the conference to engage in very important economic issues. It is heard that Roosevelt's new instructions are almost more direct than Monday's telegram. (5th National Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Death Sentence or Reprieve</h3>
<p>The Whole Country Harbors Suspicion of the US</p>
<p>(London) The feeling this morning is that the World Economic Conference has been sentenced to death, but may be granted a reprieve. The news that an agreement has been reached on the wheat issue is indeed a tonic, raising greater optimism, but the gold standard countries are very suspicious as to whether the important phone call that US President may send at 3:00 pm can serve as a reprieve. Except for the gold standard countries, most delegations now seem to be taking action to assist in avoiding an extension of the conference. It is heard that the US representatives are confused about the US President's telegram. According to the US representatives' explanation, the US President seems to say that he does not permanently oppose the gold standard, but there are questions about the method of restoring the gold standard. The US representatives are dazzled by this telegram, because this telegram can be interpreted as a change in the US President's policy. Therefore, a telegram has been sent to Washington for clarification, and it is expected that a phone call from the US President can be received at 3:00 pm, and it is expected that a firm statement can be issued in the evening. The French and Dutch sides, amidst the chaos, still insist that it is useless to want the US President to propose a currency plan that can be accepted by the gold standard countries, and refute the rumors that the US President may propose a method to allow the conference to operate within the economic scope, saying that if there is no agreement on currency, how can the economy progress? (5th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>The Question of Extension or Not</h3>
<p>Awaits Decision by the Main Committee Today</p>
<p>(London) The suspension of the London Economic Conference has become an unavoidable situation today. The main committee convened a special meeting again today to discuss ways to allow the conference to end reluctantly. Dutch Prime Minister Colijn immediately proposed adjournment, and the representatives of France and Belgium immediately seconded, making the whole scene difficult to swallow. The US representative also expressed support for the extension, saying that it was a pity that the conference ended like this. A US representative also stated that perhaps the conference would be reopened when the US has completed its plan to restore its own economic status and understanding between countries on both sides of the Atlantic has improved. British Prime Minister MacDonald did not express approval or disapproval of the motion to extend the conference at that time, because the opinions within the British delegation were still divided on this issue. For example, Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain also said that the conference should not be adjourned. Perhaps the United Kingdom will not oppose the adjournment of the conference. As for whether the conference will be extended or not, it will have to wait until the next meeting of the main committee on Thursday before a decision can be made. It is also believed that the interruption of the conference in this way may cause negative impressions of the United States. Perhaps the US government is unwilling to bear this major responsibility, so it is still hoped that a new instruction from US President Roosevelt will be issued in a day or two to save the conference from danger.

<h3>Hull Obtains Canadian Representative's Support for Temporary Request to Postpone Discussion</h3>
<p>(London) The main committee of the World Economic Conference has adjourned until Thursday. Although all parties currently believe that the World Economic Conference will close on Thursday, the US representatives are making every effort to extend the life of the conference, because there are already complaints from the outside that the Economic Conference was destroyed by President Roosevelt. (4th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) This morning, all parties believed that adjournment was inevitable, so the executive meeting decided to instruct the main committee to draft a method of adjournment. However, the situation changed slightly when the main committee met at 6:00 pm. US Secretary of State Hull, with the support of Canadian Prime Minister Bennett, stood up and vehemently opposed adjournment. Bennett also said that this matter was too important and should not be decided hastily. The committee finally followed Hull's advice and adjourned temporarily, because Chairman MacDonald also did not want the conference to be aborted and was willing to wait for the new US declaration. (4th National Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) This morning, the main committee meeting appointed a subcommittee to draft the final proposal, consisting of British Prime Minister MacDonald, Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain, French Finance Minister Bonnet, and Dutch Prime Minister Colijn. At 3:00 pm, this subcommittee discussed a motion to record the results of the conference and state the reasons for the unavoidable extension. Just as it was about to pass, a messenger arrived with a letter from the US delegation, delivered to British Prime Minister MacDonald, requesting the main committee to postpone the meeting, saying that there was an important matter to discuss. It was found that the main committee was originally scheduled to be held at 6:00 pm tonight. After British Prime Minister received this letter, he stopped the meeting of the four-member subcommittee and spoke with a US representative for half an hour. British Prime Minister then notified the drafting committee that Hull was unable to contact the US President temporarily, so the US delegation could not have a decision on the extension. British Prime Minister then decided to convene a main committee meeting at 6:00 pm. When the meeting convened at 6:00 pm in the evening, the British Prime Minister's representative presented a motion to extend the conference at the steering committee meeting. Hull protested and suggested that the main committee meet again on Thursday. French Bonnet and Italian Junger both suggested changing the meeting to Wednesday, but the US representative's suggestion was finally accepted to set the meeting on Thursday, but it was stated that there must be a practical solution at that time. In their opinion, the best procedure is the adjournment method agreed upon by the main committee this morning. At this point, the life and death of the World Economic Conference will be decided at Thursday's meeting. (4th Reuters News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>France and the Netherlands Most Strongly Advocate Adjournment Gold Standard Countries to Meet in Paris Soon</h3>
<p>(London) It is reported that France and the Netherlands are the most strongly advocating adjournment. Today, Bonnet told people that he saw very little hope of saving the conference, but if a basis for agreement can be found, he is still willing to do his best to help. It is now heard that the leaders of the central banks of the gold standard countries will meet in Paris on Friday or Saturday to discuss ways to maintain the gold standard currency and the existing ratio of gold.

<h3>Roosevelt Instructs Delegation to Make the Conference Proceed as Usual</h3>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt has returned to the White House and immediately telegraphed the US delegation attending the Economic Conference, instructing them to try to make the Economic Conference proceed as usual. Also, the instructions that President Roosevelt gave to the US delegation today were all in code and were forwarded by the Navy Department. It is confirmed that President Roosevelt firmly believes that the Economic Conference will not break down and that the US representatives will be able to make the conference proceed as usual. As for the content of the instructions, it is still kept secret, and the truth must wait for news from London. (5th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Annapolis President Roosevelt will depart for Washington tonight. According to those around him, after the US President returns to Washington to handle affairs, he will be able to decide what he wants from the World Economic Conference. The US President does not want the conference to be adjourned because a small number of countries oppose his refusal to stabilize currencies. As for whether the construction plans proposed by the three US departments of the Navy, Army, and Interior can be approved, it is thought that the US President will have an expression soon.

<h3>All Parties Make Efforts to Save the Situation The One Who Tied the Knot Should Untie It, Dependent on the US</h3>
<p>(London) Today, all parties are making efforts to save the World Economic Conference to avoid the three weeks of work of the committees and subcommittees from being wasted. British Prime Minister MacDonald is particularly active. It is heard that he has reconciled the divergent opinions of the British representatives and unanimously advocated that the conference should continue. However, many observers believe that it is difficult to save the situation. The one who tied the knot should untie it, dependent on the US. (5th National Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) Frantic talks are now underway to try to salvage the crisis of the World Economic Conference. British Prime Minister MacDonald met with Hull and representatives of other countries tonight. Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain also contacted representatives of gold standard countries such as Bonnet, Junger, and Colijn. At the same time, Denmark, Sweden, and Norway also gathered to discuss a common policy, which will be brought to the attention of the main committee when it meets on Thursday.

<h3>US Delegation Drafts Plan to Attempt to Ease the Atmosphere on All Sides</h3>
<p>(London) The US delegation met all day at the delegation office to draft a plan to explain in a simple way how the current US policy can be adapted to the work of the Economic Conference, in the hope that the Economic Conference can continue uninterrupted. There were extremely divergent opinions within the US delegation during the meeting, so the aforementioned plan has not yet been drafted as of the time of publication. (4th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Work of the Economic Committee Continues</h3>
<p>Agreement on Grain, Sugar, and Wheat Issues May Be Reached</p>
<p>(London) Before the presidium of the World Economic Conference meets tomorrow to decide whether to extend the conference, all subcommittees of the monetary committee have suspended discussions, while all subcommittees of the economic committee continue to meet. (5th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) Although the World Economic Conference has entered a state of slumber, there is a prospect of an agreement being reached on the sugar and wheat issues, which are not absolutely within the scope of the conference. According to a public announcement, the four major wheat-producing countries, Argentina, Australia, Canada, and the United States, have agreed in principle on a policy of temporarily adjusting production and trade to suit world demand. The purpose is to improve wheat prices and clear the existing surplus in the market, but it is acknowledged that the solution to this problem depends on the cooperation of European countries. As for the sugar issue, there is a saying that an agreement can be reached on Monday. China has rejected the Cuban restriction plan, but according to non-official news, Britain has agreed, and India also has a tendency to approve. (5th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Our Country Opposes Cuba's Plan to Restrict the Sugar Industry</h3>
<p>(London) China today submitted a memorandum to the sugar industry committee of the World Economic Conference, opposing the Cuban plan to restrict the sugar industry, stating that if there are other plans, China is prepared to consider participating in them, and that China's sugar production is decreasing, and if cultivation and refining methods are not improved, it will be eliminated by foreign competition. The proposal to prohibit the establishment of new sugar factories or increase the production of existing sugar factories, and not to give subsidies or bonuses, nor to increase import sugar taxes to make the current tax rate exceed 70 percent ad valorem, will make the Chinese sugar industry suffer greater sacrifices that it cannot afford. It is found that the Cuban proposal was submitted on June 21, advocating that no new sugar factories should be established for ten years, the production of existing sugar factories should not be increased, subsidies or bonuses should not be given, and import sugar taxes should not be increased to make the current tax rate exceed 70 percent ad valorem.

<p>IP&gt; Our Country Cannot Temporarily Conclude a Non-Aggression Pact with Soviet Russia</p>
<h3>Russia and the Little Entente Also Sign a Non-Aggression Pact The Contents of the Multilateral Pact</h3>
<p>(London) The non-aggression treaty independently concluded by Lithuania and Soviet Russia was originally scheduled to be signed today, but the Lithuanian representative suddenly claimed that the signing was postponed because the Lithuanian President had left Beijing and the retrial instructions had not arrived. Also, the hope of China signing this convention defining the definition of aggression has also vanished today. It is said that because the wording of the convention can only be applied to the territory under the complete jurisdiction of the signatory country, the Chinese representative believes that it is inconvenient to sign it, because the current Sino-Russian relations still recognize Manchuria as Chinese territory, but China has not been able to provide the Russians with the guarantees necessary in the convention before regaining the administrative power of Manchuria. However, the non-aggression pact between Soviet Russia and the Little Entente countries has been signed today. The wording is the same as the non-aggression pact signed by the eight countries yesterday, with only the addition of an invitation to other countries to join. Because the one signed yesterday was limited to the countries, today's pact hopes for its universal participation. (4th National Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) This afternoon, the representatives of the Soviet Union, Turkey, and the Little Entente countries continued to sign a new convention in the form of a non-aggression pact at the Soviet Embassy. The provisions of this new convention are the same as those signed by the eight countries in London yesterday, with the only addition of a new provision stipulating that any other country may sign this pact, and countries that continue to join this pact in the future may enjoy the same rights and bear the same obligations as the original signatory countries. As for the method of continued joining, it is the same as the first convention signed yesterday. Countries willing to join must first declare to the Soviet government, and then the Soviet government is responsible for notifying other joining countries. Those signing this convention were the Soviet Union's Litvinov, Romania's Titulescu, Czechoslovakia's Masaryk, Yugoslavia's Jurišić, and Turkey's Tevfik Rüştü Aras. (4th TASS Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Soviet Russia and Lithuania Also Sign Agreement</h3>
<p>Litvinov Hopes France Will Join</p>
<p>(London) Soviet Russian Foreign Affairs Commissioner Litvinov, before departing for Paris today, reportedly concluded a non-aggression treaty with Lithuania, defining aggression. It is said that Mr. Li will urge France in Paris to join the convention defining aggression as stipulated on Tuesday (i.e., the one agreed with the Little Entente), and discuss a French-Russian trade agreement. (5th National Telegram)</p>
<p>(Moscow) Representatives of the governments of the Soviet Union, Afghanistan, Estonia, Latvia, Persia, Poland, Romania, and Turkey signed a multilateral non-aggression pact at the Soviet Embassy in London yesterday. This pact will only take effect upon ratification by at least two of the signatory countries. The most important content of this pact is that it includes the definition of aggressor nations recently proposed by the Soviet delegation in Geneva.</p>
<p>The introduction states that each signatory country "being fully filled with the desire to increase the existing peaceful relations between these countries, deeply believes that the Kellogg-Briand Pact in which they participate can eliminate all aggressive acts, and for the sake of universal security, believes that it is necessary to strictly define aggressive acts in order to eliminate all tolerance for aggressive acts, and for all countries recognizes that they have equal rights to independent security, protection of territory, and free development of their government systems, deeply wishes to maintain the inviolability of the territories of these countries for the sake of the entire world, and for the sake of the entire world, considers that first applying laws that strictly define the meaning of aggressive acts between these countries, before such laws have been universally recognized and before a convention containing a definition of aggression exists, is quite useful."</p>
<p>The first article of the convention is that the signatory countries recognize the definition of the so-called aggressor country in their mutual relations. This definition is based on the proposal of the Soviet delegation and was presented in the report of the Committee on Disarmament on May 24, 1933.</p>
<p>The second article declares that the aggressor country in any international conflict should be determined and recognized according to the report mentioned in the first article, and at the same time, the agreement existing between the countries involved in the dispute must be considered. Any country that initiates one of the following actions is an aggressor country: (1) First declaring war; (2) Occupying the territory of another country by force without declaring war; (3) Attacking the naval, land, and air forces of another country without declaring war; (4) Blockading the coasts and ports of another country; (5) Assisting armed groups within its own territory that invade the territory of another country or refusing to take all possible steps at the request of the invaded country to cut off the assistance and protection of that armed group.</p>
<p>The third article stipulates that no political, military, economic, or other considerations of any kind shall be allowed to tolerate or interpret aggressive acts as defined in the second article as legal actions.</p>
<p>The fourth article stipulates the method of ratification of the convention and stipulates that the documents of ratification should be sent to the Soviet government for proper preservation, and stipulates that as soon as two common signatory countries submit the documents of ratification, the convention will take effect in those two signatory countries, and if they jointly submit their documents of ratification with other signatory countries, then this convention will also take effect for those other signatory countries.</p>
<p>In the appendix to the third article, it is declared that the signatory countries, in order to maintain the complete inviolability and absolute meaning of the provisions of this article, are willing to list the points sufficient to prove the guidance of the aggressor country, so that the following situations can never be cited as a justification for aggressive acts: (1) The domestic situation of any country, such as its political, economic, and social rule, its administrative defects, or the turmoil caused by strikes, revolutions, or counter-revolutionary movements or civil wars; (2) Any international actions of any country, such as destructive or threatening destructive actions against the material or moral rights or interests of other countries or their citizens; (3) The breakdown of diplomatic or economic relations; (4) Economic or financial boycott methods; (5) Conflicts between countries caused by financial and other obligations; (6) Border incidents other than the various specific actions listed in Article 2. At the same time, all signatory countries unanimously acknowledge that under the circumstances of disputes listed in the definition of aggressor countries in this convention, they will never allow them to be used as a tool for legal interpretation to undermine international law.

<h3>Comparison of Trade Among Nations</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 4th - Dr. Pei Qin, the representative of the Ministry of Commerce attending Parliament, declared during the budget debate of the Ministry of Commerce in the House of Commons tonight that although various countries have implemented all sorts of restrictions on world trade, British export trade has not been inferior to that of other countries. In the first four months of 1933, the value of American exports decreased by 27% compared to the same period in 1932, Germany decreased by 25%, and France decreased by 14%, while Britain only decreased by 7%. He also stated that Japan was even better than Britain, decreasing by only 6%.</p>
<h3>British-Japanese Commercial Competition</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 4th - During the House of Commons debate on the Ministry of Commerce budget, Samuel, the leader of the Liberal Party, criticized the remarks made by Dr. Pei Qin, representing the Minister of Commerce, Runciman, as being overly optimistic and reporting many untruths. He also said that the Ottawa Conference was a miserable failure. MP Attlee then spoke, concluding the debate for the Labour Party, saying that the success of the Japanese cotton textile industry was due to its sophisticated organization and low wages. Lancashire cotton textile industry should imitate what Japan has done and improve. During the debate, Conservative MPs Hamer Sley and others continued to criticize Japan's extremely low wages, as well as the working conditions and hours. Harmsworth said that no industrial market in the world has not been harmed by the competition of extremely cheap goods.

At that time, Minister of Commerce Runciman had just returned to the House of Commons from the World Economic Conference and was able to conclude the government's debate in a timely manner. Runciman mentioned the competition of Japanese goods, saying that the government had received a reply from the Japanese government regarding the proposals of the Party Department. Lancashire has established a special committee to prepare for future discussions. He hoped that a reply could be sent to the Tokyo government soon.</p>
<h3>US Recovery Plan</h3>
<p>Progress Not Very Satisfactory</p>
<p>National News Agency, Washington, 4th - The US government's agricultural and industrial recovery plans have not progressed satisfactorily, which is one of the reasons for calling a special meeting tomorrow morning. Regarding agriculture, cotton farmers in the South, seeing that cotton prices will rise sharply, believe that even with government subsidies after destroying cotton seedlings, it is not as profitable as not destroying them. Therefore, they are waiting to see what happens. Regarding industry, manufacturers' proposal of a 40-hour work week has been opposed by the labor side. Today, the president of the Labor Federation, Green, stated that unless the capitalists agree to a 31-hour work week, the new regulations cannot be accepted. Therefore, after returning from his vacation, the US President sees that both of his major recovery plans have not made the progress that was originally hoped for. However, it is expected that an agreement on new regulations will be reached in the industrial sector soon. After the labor and management sides of the textile industry agree to adopt new business regulations that can avoid overproduction, the rubber and coal industries can also follow suit. As for the agricultural recovery plan, if cotton farmers refuse to fully cooperate, it may be greatly affected.</p>

<p>Looking at the above articles, it can be seen that the Japanese side is planning to develop the Northeast China every day. Then, after ten years, the entire Northeast will be incorporated into the territory of the Three Islands. I wonder what the government authorities and the whole country will think about this.</p>
<h3>Twists and Turns in Receiving the War Zone</h3>
<p>Lei Shourong and Others Temporarily Stay in Dalian</p>
<p>Passenger Train on the Beining Road Reaches Tangshan</p>
<p>A special dispatch from Beiping states that regarding the issue of receiving the war zone, the Chinese and Japanese sides have dispatched representatives to meet in Dalian. Regarding the method of incorporating the puppet army, the Chinese side has agreed to expand the special police to 5,000 people, which is a greater concession than the original agreement of 3,000 people. The progress was smooth, but the Japanese side suddenly made demands that deviated from the scope of negotiations predetermined by our side. Therefore, the impact will cause the recovery of lost territories to fall into a standstill. Whether the situation is optimistic depends on whether the Japanese side has sincerity.</p>
<p>Lei Shourong, Xue Zhiheng, Yin Tong, and other members of the War Zone Reception Committee went to Dalian from Tianjin. On the afternoon of the 2nd, at 5:00 PM, they met with Li Jichun, Kan Duo, and Japanese Kwantung Army representatives Kita, Okamura, and Manchurian Railway Company representative Kogo at Room 138 on the third floor of the Liaodong Hotel. They first discussed the issue of the disposal of the puppet army. Our side initially only agreed to incorporate 30 people. Later, because Li Jichun's troops numbered more than 10,000, they requested to expand to 10,000, or at least 8,000. After repeated consultations, our side agreed to make concessions, but no more than 5,000, and only those with complete firearms. The Japanese side took this opportunity to make unreasonable demands: (1) After the Japanese army withdraws to the Great Wall line, the security of the war zone will be maintained by the troops of Li Jichun and Shi Yousan, who will be selected and reorganized by the Chinese side into security teams to maintain order in the war zone. The Japanese side may station monitoring troops in Miyun, Shunyi, Zunhua, and eastern Luan, with a fixed number of 500 people in each area, and withdraw after restoring the pre-war situation. (2) The transportation between Lutai and Shanhaiguan on the Beining Railway will be operated by Manchukuo, and a railway negotiation committee will be established, with China, Japan, and Manchukuo consulting on everything at any time. The Japanese side will also send Lieutenant Colonel Adachi, Colonel Kogo, and Honda, the director of the Fengshan Railway Bureau, as representatives of the sub-committee. The meeting lasted about 30 minutes and then adjourned. That night, at 8:00 PM, Kita and others hosted a banquet to invite Chinese representatives to Xingpu for a long talk until 10:00 PM, but there were no satisfactory results. Another meeting was held the next day, but there was still no progress. Lei and others telegraphed the situation to the Ping Military Branch Committee Standing Bureau, and also telegraphed to the central government and Chiang Kai-shek in Nanchang to request instructions. They also telegraphed Lei and others to temporarily stay in Dalian so that they could contact the Japanese side at any time. Therefore, Lei and his party were originally scheduled to return to Tianjin on the tomorrow (5th) to report to the military and political authorities to prepare everything for the reception. Now it has been decided to temporarily stay in Dalian and continue to conduct private consultations with Li Jichun and others. They will not be able to return to Tianjin in the next two or three days. Our side believes that this move by the Japanese not only violates the spirit of the ceasefire agreement, but also indirectly implies de facto recognition of the puppet state, which is absolutely unacceptable. The meeting was therefore suspended.</p>
<p>The Beining Road patrol car has reached Tangshan. The car departed from Tianjin at 9:05 AM yesterday (3rd), arrived at Xinhe at 10:00 AM, and departed for Lutai at 10:30 AM. In the afternoon of the same day, it arrived in Tangshan at 2:00 PM. There were 120 Japanese military police and more than 100 Beining Road Bureau police accompanying the army to jointly perform the security duties. At 7:00 PM, it still drove back to Tianjin. This morning (4th), the passenger train from Beiping to Tangshan was officially restored and tickets were sold as usual. The seventh eastbound train departed from Beiping at 5:50 AM today. Only three passenger tickets were sold, all to merchants. It passed Tianjin at 9:20 AM and arrived at Lutai at 11:00 AM, delayed by one hour along the way. At 1:30 PM in the afternoon, it arrived safely in Tangshan. At 3:20 PM, it returned to Tanggu and was changed to the tenth train to return to Beiping. As for the passenger train between Yuguan and Beiping, it will take a little longer to pass. Tickets will be sold to Beizaihe within a few days so that Chinese and foreign tourists can go to the station there. It is predicted that there will be no obstacles. According to news released by military agencies, the puppet army still occupies the area east of Lutai. Li Jichun's headquarters is located in the elementary school at the Tangshan railway station. Zhao Lei has now arrived in Tangshan, and his troops are stationed in the nearby area. The puppet army's third brigade, Cheng Guofeng's troops, is stationed in Ninghe City. The puppet army's fourth brigade, Zhang Hanchen's troops, originally stationed in the city, has been transferred to the Fengtai Zhen Beining Road station in Ninghe Northeast. The puppet army inspection team at the station is extremely active, preparing to strictly inspect passengers traveling east from Beiping and Tianjin. The uniforms of the puppet army are very ragged. It is not easy to raise food and supplies, and military discipline is extremely chaotic. Even if Li Jichun's troops can be brought under control and reorganized by us into special police, the banditry in the war zone will inevitably follow. Our military strength cannot reach the level required by the Japanese side, and the Japanese side deliberately avoids clearing the situation and does not interfere, while secretly allowing them to harass and shirk responsibility. The future of eastern Luan is feared to be rotten to an irreparable state.</p>
<p>The new Japanese embassy military attache, Shibayama, will arrive in Pingding soon. At 3:00 PM on the 7th, he will pay a courtesy visit to He Yingqin, following the old military attache, Nagatsu, as a greeting after taking office. Regarding the reception of the war zone, Shibayama will succeed Nagatsu in consulting with us on everything. The authorities are now waiting for instructions from the central government before making further efforts to negotiate. The puppet army is taking advantage of the change in attitude of the Japanese side to make demands, and the future is full of twists and turns. It is expected that it will be difficult to resolve the matter quickly in the next few days (July 4th).</p>
<h3>Resolution of the Chahar Incident Will Take a Different Path</h3>
<p>First Settle the Troops, Then Talk About Politics</p>
<p>Zhao Pilian Goes to Shanxi to Ask Yan to Mediate</p>
<p>Feng Yuxiang's Attitude Remains Firm</p>
<p>A special dispatch from Beiping states that Feng Yuxiang's representative, Li Xin, returned to Ping yesterday morning (3rd) from Zhangjiakou. After getting off the train, he first met with Song Zheyuan. Feng expressed his hope that Song would return to Chahar Province immediately, stating that his personal expedition was purely to protect Chahar Province and that the external goal had not changed in the slightest. He did not comment on the methods proposed by Pingfang. Song immediately convened a meeting with Qin Dechun and others to discuss it once. In the afternoon, Song also went to Jurentang to meet with He Yingqin to explain everything. They are now waiting for a reply from the central government. Because Song suffered from nephritis, he originally intended to go to Tianjin within a few days to seek medical treatment. Because the Chahar incident had reached a stalemate, he was deeply afraid that leaving Ping at this time would cause outside doubts. He has decided to stop. This noon (4th), he telegraphed Deng Zhexi in Tianjin to come to Pingding, and will consult again in the evening. Feng had previously expressed two opinions when Huang Fu's representative, Ma Boyuan, visited Zhang: (1) All parties cannot understand him personally. He hopes to meet frankly and is very happy with peaceful methods. (2) He personally vowed to recover the lost land to fulfill his long-cherished wish to resist Japan and protect Chahar. The Ping authorities believe that all problems must be understood mutually before a solution is possible. If prejudices are not eliminated, the situation is extremely worrying. A different path will be taken for the Chahar incident, but the mediation efforts will not be abandoned. Those who are mediating from the sidelines are still running around and appealing. A peaceful solution is not completely hopeless. Zhao Pilian went to Zhongnanhai yesterday after arriving in Ping from Beijing to visit He Yingqin and Huang Fu to discuss the Chahar incident. That evening, Zhao left Ping for Shanxi to explain the central government's intentions to Yan Chenming and ask him to mediate. It has not yet been fully decided how effectively Yan will persuade Feng. The central government will still ask Kong Xiangxi to go to the north, and if necessary, will send a senior official to Zhang to meet with Feng to avoid a rupture. It is also planned that if there is no hope of reconciliation, a method of settling the troops in Chahar Province will be decided first, and then the political solution will be discussed. For example, after Bao Gang's unit of Fang Zhenwu's troops recently arrived in Datong, personnel have been dispatched by the Shanxi side to inspect. Zhang Renjie also recently telegraphed Song Zheyuan, seeming to accept the central government's intentions. From this point of view, if the troops in Chahar Province are properly settled, it is also an indirect solution to the Chahar incident. (Reported on July 4th) Another special dispatch states that after Feng made four suggestions for the second time, the Pingfang authorities proposed two solutions after careful discussion. Song Zheyuan wrote a letter to Feng's representative, Li Xin, and carried it to Zhangjiakou to discuss with Feng in detail. After Li Xin arrived in Zhang and visited Feng, he transferred it and conveyed the situation of the contact in Ping. Feng did not make any expression at the time. The next day, a meeting was convened. In addition to Feng himself, the participants were Fang Zhenwu, Ji Hongchang, Tong Lin阁, Sun Liangcheng, Zhang Renjie, Qiu Shanmi and other ten people. Li Xin also attended the meeting. First of all, Feng handed over Song Zheyuan's original letter to the audience for viewing, and then Li Xin reported on the situation of the contact in Ping. Feng then said that the two solutions proposed by Pingfang are: (1) Feng will immediately cancel the name of the Anti-Japanese Allied Army. (2) Feng will lead the guards to live in the suburbs of Ping and ask everyone to discuss. Fang Zhenwu immediately stood up and said that we were purely based on conscience and advocated uniting with the masses to resist Japan. Those who really resist Japan are all good friends, with the same志同道合. Even if there is夙怨, it can be abandoned and resolved, and we can help each other in the same boat. Those who obstruct the anti-Japanese work are the public enemies of the people of the country, that is, the public enemies of us. We came to resist Japan because Mr. Feng is an anti-Japanese person, so we are willing to stand on a front line to resist strong enemies and recover lost land. If Mr. Feng wants to abandon halfway today and cancel the name of the Anti-Japanese Allied Army, then we will immediately separate from Mr. Feng today, go our own way, and act independently. The words were very excited at the time. After Fang finished speaking, Ji Hongchang, Tong Lin閱 and others also echoed and made excited remarks. Under the tense atmosphere, Feng stood up resolutely, tore up Song's original letter to show his determination, and decided not to cancel the name of the Anti-Japanese Allied Army and vowed to protect Chahar Province and recover the lost land. No answer was given to the two solutions proposed by Pingfang. Only an opinion was expressed roughly that the individual's "purpose is to protect Chahar Province, and he is now recovering Kangbao Baochang and let Fang Zhenwu Ji Hongchang and others lead their troops to advance eastward. Once Duolun is recovered and Chahar is stabilized, personal goals can be achieved and then other things can be discussed. During the period of raising troops to resist Japan and recover lost land, I hope that Song Zheyuan will lead his troops back to Chahar to be responsible for hosting one opinion. After the decision was made, Li Xin returned to Ping to report. Li arrived in Ping yesterday and went to Wuyiku to visit Song and report everything. Song then invited Qin Dechun, Ge Dingyuan, etc. to discuss the afternoon. Song went to Jurentang to visit He. He felt that Feng's attitude was so difficult and transferred the details to the Central Committee and Chiang Kai-shek and asked for instructions on everything. The Central Committee's incoming telegram decided everything. Although the Ping authorities felt that the Chahar incident was at a stalemate, they were still trying to find a solution and hoped that Yan Xishan would come forward to mediate in order to make a change. Zhao Pilian hurried to Yan to visit Yan, which was probably related to this. Zhangjiakou has now expanded its organization and established military and political committees, etc. All actions are very active. Since Liu Guitang's defection, he has transferred all to Guyuan Kangbao Baochang and other places have been recovered by Fang Zhenwu Ji Hongchang and other troops. Baochang is stationed by Zhang Renjie's division in Fang's division, and Kangbao is stationed by Ji's troops. Feng and others plan to concentrate the troops in the northern road in Baochang first, and then advance to Duolun, aiming to recover Duolun in the shortest possible time (July 4th).</p>
<h3>Anhui Bandits Have Been Rampant Again Recently</h3>
<p>The Green Gauze Tent Has Risen and They Are Reckless</p>
<p>Military Police Everywhere are Currently Engaged in Suppression</p>
<p>A correspondent from Bengbu reports that Anhui Province, known for its many bandits, has been subject to years of suppression, but has not been completely cleared. Now that the green gauze tent has risen, the bandits have concealment and their power has risen again. The recent bandit situation is recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Northern Anhui</h3>
<p>Northern Anhui, Fuyang, is adjacent to the border of Henan Province. The bandit disaster has been very serious in recent years, and the people have suffered unspeakable damage. Bandit leaders Li Gongcheng, Zhao Hongshan, and others have gathered their followers and run rampant in the Fuyang, Taihe, and Hao counties. The government army has repeatedly launched suppression campaigns, but has failed to wipe them out. In recent months, they have returned to Fuyang to rob, kidnap, burn, and kill indiscriminately. For example, Jiaopo Village in the third district of the county, Xijiao, Xiejie in the northwest of the tenth district, Renzhai and Tongyangcheng have been captured by bandits one after another. The houses in each village have been almost completely burned down, and many residents who failed to escape have been brutally killed by the bandits. The county's security team fears that the bandit forces will spread, and has set out from Shenqiu to suppress them.</p>
<h3>Central Anhui</h3>
<p>The bandit leader in Central Anhui, Hefei, Shucheng, and Lu'an, Zhang Dabizi, has more than a thousand followers and sometimes sneaks to the border area between Shouxian and Fengtai. Last month, the 21st Brigade of the 7th Division, Li Wenbin's troops, was ordered to suppress them and completely wiped out four gangs of bandits, Huang Shand, Wang Zhengsi, Wang Chengtang, and Dafangniu, in Sanjue Temple, where the six counties of Shou are in contact. The four bandit leaders were injured and captured, and the bandit forces were slightly reduced. The Fengtai security team recently captured the bandit leaders Quan Erxiuzi, Quan Sanxiuzi, Quan Sixiazi, and Li Jingbao, who burned Sanjue Temple last time. The four bandit leaders have been executed by shooting, and the remaining bandits are still harassing the area around Shou Hefeng. Xi Chulin, the Administrative Inspector of the Fourth District, immediately supervised the Provincial Security Team, Ni Rongxian Corps, and the Changhuai River Maritime Public Security Bureau Guerrilla Brigade to suppress them as appropriate.</p>
<h3>Eastern Anhui</h3>
<p>Eastern Anhui, Sixian, Wangyi, is adjacent to Jiangsu Province and borders Hongze Lake, where ports and rivers are intertwined and reeds are jagged. It has always been a den of bandits. The mountains and ridges around Lai'an and Jiashan are complex and easy to hide bandits. The bandit leaders Wei Yousan, Wu Qi, Pei Si, and other gangs have been running rampant for several years. The government army has repeatedly launched suppression campaigns, so they have attacked each other and have not been wiped out. Recently, they have joined forces to harass the troops of Shi Brigade, who was transferred to Siyang, and the security teams of various counties have been separated to suppress them. (July 4th)</p>
<h3>Wujiang</h3>
<p>The Department Orders the Closing of the Electric Light Factory</p>
<p>The electric lights in the city were originally founded by the Bureau of Construction. Due to the small engine power and too many installed households, the lights were so dim that they were impractical. The county Chamber of Commerce and others had requested the county government to submit a report to the Department of Construction to close the Wujiang Electric Plant. Yesterday, the local county government received instructions from the Department of Construction, stating that the county Chamber of Commerce had reported the request to close the Wujiang Electric Plant. Previously, the county magistrate was ordered to reply that it was proposed to close the original plant and transfer the business rights to the Suzhou Electric Steam Plant. It was deemed that the proposed method was not appropriate. For careful handling, the County Construction Guidance Engineer Zhang Bing of the Department was ordered to go to investigate and negotiate. Now, according to the report, the representatives of various local public groups in the county still unanimously believe that the business should be completely transferred to the Suzhou Electric Plant and that the original plant should be closed. It is now approved that a connection with the Suzhou Plant be made for electricity. The Wujiang Electric Plant originally belonged to the county-run enterprise. Since the local public groups in the county unanimously wished to transfer the business rights to the Suzhou Electric Plant, their request to close the original plant and negotiate with the Suzhou Plant for power transmission is tentatively approved. Before the Suzhou Plant provides electricity, the original plant will continue to supply electricity temporarily to maintain public use. All matters to be handled regarding the implementation of the closure of the plant and the methods for the disposition of assets should be planned and determined by the county magistrate and reported for approval. Furthermore, it should be ascertained that the construction special donation of 2,720 yuan allocated by the plant should be returned to the county government. After receiving the order, it has been transferred to the Chamber of Commerce for compliance, consultation, and proper planning to report for review and transfer.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Examination of Han Wentai's Corpse</p>
<p>The case of Xu Xiexiang, the head of the Third District (Yangming Township), Han Wentai, being kidnapped and murdered by bandits has already been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, at around 7:00 AM, Prosecutor Shen, accompanied by Examiner Wang and court police, took a steamer down to the countryside for an examination. They arrived in the township at around 10:00 AM. The chief of the area, Chen Xiangsheng, had already prepared the scene. After Prosecutor Shen took his seat, he first interrogated Yang Ashi, a neighbor of the kidnapper, and then interrogated Han Wentai's son, Keliang, and his wife, Zhou. After the interrogation, he ordered the workers to dig up the body. Upon examination, it was found that the deceased's hands were tied with rope, and there were two rope marks on his head and neck. One of his left incisors was missing, and the root was red, indicating that he had been strangled to death while alive. After the examination, the body was prepared for burial by his family.</p>
<h3>Yongtai Silk Factory Opens Training Class</h3>
<p>The Wuxi Yongtai Silk Factory has been in operation for over thirty years. Due to its complete internal facilities and the precision of its management, its Golden Deer brand and Globe brand fine silks have long been famous both at home and abroad. In recent years, the factory, recognizing the decline of the silk industry and the need to cultivate specialized talents to reverse this trend, has established a training class for practical training, offering specialized courses in sericulture, silk production, economics, Chinese, English, Japanese, arithmetic, and management. This has been done for four sessions, and the application period for the fifth session has already begun, closing on July 25th. Those wishing to apply can write directly to the factory outside the South Gate of Wuxi for a copy of the regulations.</p>
<h3>Joint Mobilization of Land and Water Police to Capture Thieves</h3>
<p>The Wuxi County Government, noting the recent series of robbery cases in Wuxi, has repeatedly ordered investigations, but few have been solved. A strict order has been issued to all land and water police to intensify their efforts to maintain public order. Therefore, in recent days, the police have been jointly mobilized for overt and covert investigations, resulting in several arrests. Details are as follows: 1) Mi Meiji, the head of the Eighth District security, received a tip that Xie Qiuhan, a notorious bandit who robbed Wu Shoukun's house in the Seventh District in September of the Republic of China Year 17, was hiding in Lihua Village. He immediately reported this to the County Public Security Bureau's Detective Team, who disguised themselves and rushed to the location, arrested him, and transferred him to the County Government. 2) Tan Weinan, the head of the 16th Public Security Sub-bureau, received information that Chen Ada, a former communist who robbed the Lu family and the Xiang Hua family at the Linquan Nunnery brickyard at the foot of Jiaoshan, was hiding in Mengjia Bridge. He dispatched officer Huang Dexian with police to go there at night. However, Chen had already heard the news and tried to escape. The police pursued him vigorously, but he escaped by swimming away and was not captured.</p>
<h3>Changzhou</h3>
<p>Prosecutor Examines Murder Case</p>
<p>Sun Gou Shun, a resident of Xinfeng Town outside the Zhongshan Gate of Wuyi, had previously betrothed his younger sister to Fan Guoguang, who lived in the northern suburbs. They were not yet married. Fan rented his future wife's house and made a living by knitting socks. Recently, the sock factory closed, and he had no means of support. Suddenly, on the morning of the 4th, he had a moment of despair and hanged himself in the house. It was not until dawn that Sun Gou Shun discovered him and reported it to Patrol Officer Jin Wei of the Fourth Sub-station of the First Public Security Bureau. Patrol Officer Jin reported it to the County Court and requested that someone be sent for an examination. Chief Prosecutor Yang Kongyi went to the scene and confirmed that it was a suicide by hanging and that there was no other cause. He instructed the family to prepare a coffin and bury the body themselves.</p>
<h3>Jiaxing</h3>
<p>Murder Case Occurs at Jiejing Bridge</p>
<p>Ma Jiehe, a farmer at Jiejing Bridge in Baimayan, the Seventh District of Jiaxing, was exceptionally brutal. Yesterday, he got into a dispute with his neighbor, Jiang Zhang, over irrigation. Ma assaulted Jiang, who immediately fell to the ground unconscious. Jiang’s son, Jiang Heshang, reported the incident to the security team, who brought Ma to the team headquarters. However, shortly after, Jiang died of his injuries. Ma, realizing that he had committed murder, took the opportunity to escape. The case has now been filed with the local court by the deceased's brother, Zhang Side, who accused the security team of deliberately releasing the suspect. The prosecutor's office received the complaint and went to the scene for an examination on the 5th.</p>
<p>Property of Land Tax Collection Director Sealed</p>
<p>Jiaxing County has completed the inventory and collection of surplus receipts from the 16th to the 21st year of the Republic. It is estimated that there is a shortage of over 46,000 yuan in land tax and substitute payments. Bureau Chief Wang Yingyang suspects that the former director, Gao Yucun, embezzled the money due to the large amount of the shortfall. On the 4th, he ordered the police to seal all of Gao's property to cover the losses and issued an arrest warrant for Gao to be brought to justice.</p>
<h3>Jiangzhen</h3>
<p>Brick, Tile, and Lime Tax Collection Begins</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Brick, Tile, and Lime Tax Bureau has established special collection offices in various districts. The investigation of taxpayers is largely complete, with approximately ten thousand households scattered throughout the countryside. It is reported that the investigation is still not considered accurate. The bureau began collecting the tax this month.</p>
<h3>Wu Chengyang Suspected of Murder</h3>
<p>Wu Chengyang, the dismissed head of the Third Autonomous District, and Wang Ruizhi, the clerk of the district office, are suspected of murdering Xie Yifang, a villager from the upper part of the district. Xie's wife, Cai, filed a complaint with the court, which summoned them for investigation and placed them under arrest. The prosecutor's office yesterday summoned witnesses and held a hearing. As a result, Wu and Wang requested bail, which was denied. After the interrogation, they were returned to custody pending a review of the case.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou</h3>
<p>Three Bandits Captured in Guazhou Kidnapping Case</p>
<p>Wang Wanyi, the contractor of the Zhongxing Coal Mine Company in Guazhou, was robbed and kidnapped by bandits. After the incident, the responsible water police team strictly ordered detectives to cooperate in the investigation. Later, the Wang family received a letter from the bandits demanding ransom, which was mailed from Zhenjiang. The team dispatched detectives to investigate the post office in Zhenjiang. One afternoon, they saw someone mailing a letter to Wang of the Zhongxing Company in Guazhou. The detectives checked the letter and confirmed that it matched the previous letter. They followed the suspect and arrested two bandits, Jin and Zhu. They confessed to having nine accomplices. Later, they captured another suspect, Chen, in Tuciao, Guazhen. All three were arrested and are awaiting interrogation.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou</h3>
<p>New Director of Aviation Administration Takes Office</p>
<p>Ge Jingen, the director of the Aviation Administration and acting principal of the Aviation School, had firmly requested to resign from his concurrent positions. His resignation was approved by the 114th meeting of the Executive Yuan, which decided to transfer Ge Jingen to the position of Vice Chief of Staff of the General Staff Department. Xu Peigen, the head of the Education Corps of the Central Military Academy, was appointed to succeed him as Director. After receiving the order, Xu arrived in Hangzhou by night train the previous evening (the 5th). Yesterday morning at 9:00 AM, Xu, accompanied only by an aide, went to the Aviation Administration in Meidong Gaoqiao to take over the position. The former Director, Ge Jingen, personally handed over the responsibilities. A meeting of all staff members was then held in the main hall. Ge Jingen first introduced Xu to the staff, followed by Xu Peigen, the new director, who gave a speech, saying that he had always served in various military organizations and did not wish to bring in private individuals to be arbitrarily placed in positions. He asked everyone to work diligently and promised that he would not make changes easily in the future. He then recounted two stories from his time studying in Germany to encourage all staff members to strive for excellence and to serve the aviation industry and the nation. After the meeting, photos were taken and the staff dispersed.</p>
<h3>Jiangqing</h3>
<p>Zhang Fuhe Project Completed</p>
<p>The Zhangfu Irrigation Canal in the 26th districts of Huaiyin, which is a crucial passage for diverting the Huai River into the Grand Canal, was dredged by the Huai River into the Sea Waterway Engineering Bureau starting in January of this year. The original completion date was set for May, but due to the difficulty of melting ice and snow at the beginning of construction and subsequent drainage work, the project cost over 500,000 yuan and was completed two months late. This morning (the 1st), Director Ma Dengyun, accompanied by Zhao Jingshi, the Chief of Staff of the First Route Army, Chen Yuezhong, the director of the Huaibei section of the project office, Pan Zhongjia, the Administrative Commissioner of the 11th District, and others, traveled by car to inspect the canal and dismantle the dams along the Zhangfu River to divert water from the Huai River into the Grand Canal. The inspection and work were completed at 7:00 PM, and they returned to Pu.</p>
<h3>Hurried Construction of Huaiyin Shangnan Levee to Prevent Flooding</h3>
<p>Chen Tiaoyuan, the commander-in-chief of the First Route Army, has paid close attention to the water conservancy of the Grand Canal since stationing troops in northern Jiangsu, having witnessed the devastating floods of the 20th year of the Republic. In the spring, he sent troops to plant over 240,000 trees along both banks of the Grand Canal in Jiangsu Province. Recently, due to rising river levels, flood prevention has become important. He consulted with the Grand Canal Engineering Bureau to find a way to prevent flooding. The Grand Canal Engineering Bureau also considered this matter important. It was found that the Shangnan Levee in Matou Town, Huaiyin, had cost 20,000 to 30,000 yuan for emergency repairs in the 10th and 20th years of the Republic. If the levee were to breach and two or three sluice gates were to collapse, the flood would affect the area along the lower Huai River east of Huaiyin. In order to prevent this, it was proposed to build an over-levee in front of the Shangnan Levee to reinforce the flood defenses. However, due to a lack of funds, Zhu Neng could not begin construction. The provincial government has now approved the project. However, it is currently the busy farming season and there are insufficient funds. It was decided that the First Route Army would send troops to carry out the construction, while the Huaibei section of the Grand Canal Engineering Bureau would provide guidance. Work is expected to begin within days.</p>

<p>Huang Shaoxiong, the Minister of Interior, was previously ordered by the Central Government to go to Hong Kong to meet with key figures in the Southwest to explain misunderstandings about the armistice agreement in North China and the Central Government's foreign policy. He has now completed his mission and returned to Shanghai yesterday morning at 10:00 AM aboard the Asia Queen of the Changxing Company. Huang stated that he did not meet with Hu Hanmin and Chen Mingshu is not coming to Nanjing for now, but has specially sent Deng Shizeng, the Chief of Staff of the 19th Route Army, to come north as his representative to liaise with the Central Government. Huang will go to Nanjing soon to report on his mission and then to Jiangxi to report all details to Chiang Kai-shek. Details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Arrival Situation</h3>
<p>Huang traveled back and forth for more than 20 days, staying in Hong Kong for about two weeks. He did not go to Guangzhou. On the 3rd of this month, he came to Shanghai from Hong Kong on the Asia Queen with Huang Huashou, the former Director of Education of Guangxi, and two attendants. The ship arrived at the Qichang Wharf in Pudong at 10:00 AM yesterday morning. He changed to a small company ferry to cross the river and landed at the Xinguanshui Wharf at around 12:00 PM, proceeding directly to his private residence in the French Concession to rest.</p>
<h3>Stay in Hong Kong</h3>
<p>This reporter met with Huang on the ship yesterday morning. According to Huang, he stayed in Hong Kong for more than two weeks, meeting repeatedly with Chen Mingshu, Jiang Guangding, Li Zongren, Li Jishen, and others to explain past misunderstandings. The results were good. He did not meet with Mr. Hu Hanmin because Hu is currently a private citizen and there was no special need to visit him. As for Mr. Chen Jitang, he only spoke to him by telephone, so he did not go to Guangzhou.</p>
<h3>Chen Sends Representative</h3>
<p>Huang also stated that Chen Mingshu is not going to Nanjing for now. He has ordered Deng Shizeng, the Chief of Staff of the Fujian Pacification Headquarters, to go north first as his representative to liaise with the Central Government. If necessary, Chen will come to Nanjing again. Deng has now returned to Fujian and, after making some arrangements, will take the next ship to Shanghai and then to Nanjing. Huang Huashou's visit to Shanghai is a private matter. Rumors that he is a representative of Mr. Hu Hanmin are absolutely false.</p>
<h3>Government Formation Atmosphere</h3>
<p>Regarding the Southwest's plan to expand the organization of the government, Huang said that there was such an atmosphere initially, but there were no results and it is unlikely to be realized. There was indeed opposition to the US loan for cotton and wheat. As for the National Assembly issue, he did not know their attitude because it was not discussed. The Southwest also did not express any explicit opinions on the Cha Feng incident.</p>
<h3>Guangdong and Guangxi Suppressing Bandits</h3>
<p>Guangdong Province has sent more than 30 regiments to suppress bandits, and Guangxi has also sent four regiments, all of which are on the border between Guangdong and Jiangxi. Once the overall plan is completed and transportation issues are resolved, there should be significant progress. The construction projects in Guangxi Province are still good. As for the local autonomy situation, he does not know the details because he has not returned to Guangxi for a long time. As for the French taking advantage of Vietnam to monitor Guangxi, we are of course making defensive preparations.</p>
<h3>Met Three Warships En Route</h3>
<p>Regarding the three Northeastern warships, including the Haiqi, sailing south to join Guangdong, Huang said that he was en route and did not know the situation very well. However, on the afternoon of the day the ships set sail (the 4th), in the waters north of ______, he saw three Chinese warships anchored and not taking any action. He assumed that they were the three fleeing Northeastern warships.</p>
<h3>Going to Nanjing and then to Jiangxi</h3>
<p>Huang finally stated that the Southwest side did not raise any specific opinions this time, and Hu Hanmin did not entrust him with any letters to take to Nanjing. All kinds of speculation outside are unfounded. He has been running around in the north and south for six months and is exhausted. He will rest in Shanghai for a day or two and then go to Nanjing to report on his mission, and then to Jiangxi to report everything to Chiang Kai-shek.</p>
<h3>Financial and Disarmament Bonds Drawn Yesterday</h3>
<p>Financial Bonds: Payments from the 15th</p>
<p>Disarmament Bonds: Payments from the 31st</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance held the draw for the sixth redemption of the Republic of China Year 20 Financial Short-Term Bonds and the twelfth redemption of the Republic of China Year 18 Disarmament Bonds at 10:00 AM yesterday in the Bank Association Building on Hong Kong Road. A total of two financial short-term bonds were drawn for a total redemption value of 160,000 yuan. One disarmament bond was drawn for a total redemption value of 500,000 yuan. Details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Representatives Present</h3>
<p>The meeting was chaired by Zheng Lai, Director of the Public Debt Department of the Ministry of Finance. Supervisors included Li Wenbo from the Audit Department, Chen Zhezhen from the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, Fan Jietang from the National Debt Fund Custody Committee, Xu Ji from the Shanghai Banking Association, Qian Yuansheng from the Shanghai Money Dealers Association, Li Wanqing from the Jiangsu High Court, Zhu Shizhen from the Tianjin Chamber of Commerce, Xia Jilin from the Hankou Chamber of Commerce, and Lu Shuping from the City Government, as well as dozens of others.</p>
<h3>Chairman's Report</h3>
<p>Chairman Zheng Lai reported that today is the date for the sixth redemption of the Republic of China Year 20 Financial Short-Term Bonds and the twelfth redemption of the Republic of China Year 18 Disarmament Bonds. He was pleased that everyone was present to witness the event. The total issue amount of the Year 20 Financial Short-Term Bonds was 80 million yuan. After the first to fifth redemptions, this is the sixth redemption, drawing two bonds for a total of 160,000 yuan, which is equivalent to two per thousand of the total issue amount of the bonds. Therefore, the drawing method requires that the last three digits of the winning bonds be the same. The total issue amount of the Republic of China Year 18 Disarmament Bonds was 50 million yuan. After the first to eleventh redemptions, this is the twelfth redemption, drawing one bond for a total of 500,000 yuan, which is equivalent to one percent of the total issue amount of the bonds. Therefore, the drawing method can still use the same last two digits for the winning bond. The payment for the aforementioned two types of winning bonds, the Year 20 Financial Short-Term Bonds, is scheduled to begin on the 15th of this month, and the payment for the Year 18 Disarmament Bonds is scheduled to begin on the 31st of this month. The Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications will make payments together with the accrued interest in all locations, and payments will be made in national currency regardless of location. He requested that the supervisors verify the winning bonds and the bond stubs for implementation of the drawing.</p>
<h3>Winning Numbers</h3>
<p>After the Chairman's report, the drawing was held. The two winning numbers for the Year 20 Financial Short-Term Bonds were "694" and "833." The one winning number for the Year 18 Disarmament Bonds was "71." As each winning bond was drawn, the drawing officer would present the bond to the Chairman for verification, and then hand it to the supervisors for review and verification before registering it for the record.</p>
<h3>Workers at Zhabei Silk Factory Suddenly Strike Yesterday Afternoon</h3>
<p>A Total of Eleven Factories Involved, with More Than 5,000 Workers</p>
<p>A Disturbance Occurs; One Rickshaw Puller is Injured</p>
<p>Seven Workers Detained and Sent to the Public Security Bureau</p>
<p>The Union Jointly Appeals to Party and Government for Swift Mediation</p>
<p>Workers in various silk factories in Zhabei, demanding the restoration of original wages, silkworm moth subsidies, and Sunday bonuses, were unsuccessful. Yesterday afternoon at 1:00 PM, all 354 male and female workers at the Zhengfeng Silk Factory at the end of Tianbao Road initiated a strike. The strike then spread to Yichang, Yongting, Changfeng, and other factories, all of which joined the strike. A disturbance occurred, and the situation was quite serious. The City Party Headquarters has sent personnel to investigate the matter thoroughly. Details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Cause of the Strike</h3>
<p>The Zhengfeng and other silk factories previously reduced workers' wages and cancelled silkworm moth subsidies and Sunday bonuses due to the poor silk market and declining business in order to maintain operations. The workers at that time were also aware of the difficulties faced by the employers and accepted the situation. However, since the spring silkworm season began this year, the market price of raw silk has continued to rise. As a result, the workers of various factories have demanded the restoration of their original wages and all bonuses. The silk industry unions of the Third, Fourth, and Sixth Districts jointly sent personnel to negotiate with the employers, but without success. As a result, the workers' discontent has been brewing.</p>
<h3>Declaring a Strike</h3>
<p>At around 1:00 PM yesterday afternoon, some workers at the Zhengfeng Silk Factory at the end of Tianbao Road initiated a strike. Soon, all 300 workers in the factory joined in the response and decided to notify the workers in other factories to take concerted action. They set off in batches to various factories on Tiantong Road, Zhangjia Lane Road, Wuzhou Road, Disiwei Road, and Tiantong Road. Upon hearing the news, the workers at each factory stopped work and left the factory to join the group and seek help from other factories. As a result, the factories had no choice but to declare a shutdown. In total, the factories involved were Zhengfeng, Zhengda, Xiangcheng, Yuncheng, Yifengsheng, Changfeng, Yongting, Fulunheng, Yichang, and the two Yichang factories, totaling 11 factories. There were 431 male workers and 4,788 female workers involved. The situation within the Zhabei silk factory area was very serious.</p>
<h3>Disturbances Occur</h3>
<p>However, when some workers swarmed to the Xiangcheng and Yuncheng silk factories on Tiantong Road to make similar demands, the factories, caught off guard, immediately closed their gates. At that time, the number of workers was large and the order was extremely chaotic. The glass windows of the two factories were smashed with stones, and the crowd was noisy. The factories had no choice but to order people to open the factory gates, and the workers took the opportunity to leave the factory. However, the workers continued to hurl stones inside, and Lu Er, a rickshaw puller at the factory, was hit on the head, causing him to bleed profusely.</p>
<h3>Police Suppression</h3>
<p>The responsible Fifth District Third Sub-station received a report and immediately ordered all patrol officers to the scene to suppress the unrest. Several workers were arrested on the spot for throwing stones, but the large number of workers made it impossible to maintain order. The sub-station chief, Wen, notified the Public Security Bureau by telephone, and the Bureau ordered a squadron of the police brigade to accompany the personnel of the Inspectorate to the scene to cooperate in suppressing the unrest. The workers then began to disperse one after another.</p>
<h3>Workers Detained</h3>
<p>The names of the stone-throwing workers arrested by the police are Gao Xiaowuzi, Chen Shuying, Zhao Di, Xiaowuzi, A San, Wuzi, and Chen A Er, totaling seven people. They were briefly questioned at the Fifth District Third Sub-station and then sent to the Third Section of the City Public Security Bureau for disposition.</p>
<h3>Party Headquarters Investigates</h3>
<p>After receiving news of the silk factory workers' strike, the City Party Headquarters immediately ordered the Civil Affairs Section to send personnel to investigate the truth. It is understood that the investigation has been reported and the Social Affairs Bureau will be involved in handling the matter properly.</p>
<h3>Union Submits Document</h3>
<p>The silk industry unions of the Third, Fourth, and Sixth Districts of the city jointly submitted a document yesterday to the party and government authorities, stating that they were applying to the Social Affairs Bureau for mediation. The document stated that the silk factories in the city had repeatedly reduced wages for many years due to the poor silk market, and that silkworm moth subsidies and Sunday bonuses for all male and female workers had been gradually cancelled. The workers had endured this hardship for years. Now, since the spring silkworm season began this year, the price of raw silk has gradually risen, and the workers of various factories have stated that the current price of silk is close to 1,000 yuan per picul, and it is urgent to demand that the employers restore the reduced wages, silkworm moth subsidies, Sunday bonuses, and other benefits in full in order to maintain the livelihoods of the workers and demonstrate fairness. Therefore, the unions have repeatedly negotiated with the employers, and although the employers have also acknowledged the need for restoration, the negotiations have not been resolved after a long time. The workers are waiting anxiously and cannot wait any longer. Therefore, the unions have jointly submitted this document to your committee, earnestly requesting that you convene a mediation meeting with the Social Affairs Bureau as soon as possible to resolve the matter. A separate document has been submitted to the Social Affairs Bureau.</p>
<h3>After Discovering Anti-Japanese Goods, the City Federation of Trade Unions Yesterday Submitted a Request to the City Party Headquarters for Disposal</h3>
<p>And Sent Letters to Various National Products Organizations</p>
<p>Thoroughly Investigate Factories Impersonating National Products</p>
<p>The Anti-Japanese Goods Inspection Team of the First Special District of the City Federation of Trade Unions has discovered many kinds of anti-Japanese goods since starting its inspection. Yesterday, it specially submitted a request to the City Party Headquarters for their disposal. There are also those who change the appearance of anti-Japanese goods and impersonate national products for sale on the market. In order to strictly eliminate anti-Japanese goods, the federation also sent letters to various national products organizations yesterday, requesting them to thoroughly investigate. The original text is recorded below:</p>
<h3>Request to the City Party Headquarters</h3>
<p>It is hereby reported that the association, in view of the deepening national crisis and the fact that the promotion of national products is essential to saving the country, is making every effort to promote the national products movement. However, unscrupulous merchants who have lost their minds dare to change the appearance of Japanese goods and impersonate national products, which is extremely abhorrent. It has been reported that Baosheng Cotton Cloth Shop in Hengyuan Lane, Tianjin Road, is changing the brands of a large quantity of Japanese goods and transporting them for sale inland, which has a profound impact on national products. The association sent personnel to the shop at 10:00 AM on June 1st, accompanied by the 35th District Branch, and found nine boxes of four gentlemen brand cloth from the Neiwaimian Cotton Yarn Factory, Japanese goods that had not yet been changed. The shop voluntarily filled out a pledge not to sell anti-Japanese goods on the spot and requested that they be sealed. They also stated that they would voluntarily send the Japanese goods to the warehouse and submit the warehouse receipt for inspection. The association immediately took photos of the Japanese goods and stored them. However, the manager of the shop had ulterior motives and acted contrary to his promises. It has been more than a month now and he has never submitted the warehouse receipt to the association. It is undoubtedly that he has changed the brand of the Japanese goods and transported them for sale to other ports under the guise of national products. If we do not investigate, how can we appease the hearts of good merchants? Therefore, we report the situation to your committee and earnestly request that you investigate the shop strictly in accordance with the law in order to deter others and suppress the evil wind. It is hoped that your committee will approve the investigation of the shop to determine the existence of the goods.</p>
<h3>Letter to National Products Organizations</h3>
<p>It is hereby stated that the four northeastern provinces have been occupied by the Japanese army and the rivers and mountains of China have changed color. All Chinese people are heartbroken and indignant and economic severance with Japan is the only proposition of businessmen. However, some enslaved people are willing to be used by unscrupulous merchants who change the appearance of Japanese goods and impersonate products from national products manufacturers. Or national products manufacturers collude to cheat for their own profit, or use Japanese raw materials to make products under the name of Chinese factory products is also not uncommon. If strict measures are not taken to crack down on such an evil trend it will worsen with each passing day and the implications will be impossible to bear. According to recent confidential reports, it has been found that merchants in the Dazhongyang, Guangxin, Xingtaichang, Gudetai, Huaxing, and Chenjuchang factories are selling goods to other ports using the above-mentioned techniques. It is heard that these merchants are members of various national products organizations. It is hoped that your associations will quickly investigate and, if they have already joined the association, they should be sanctioned by thoroughly investigating and removing them from the association. And you should publicize the circumstances of the merchants so as to warn the evil and the treacherous. The future of national products is truly dependent on you.</p>
<h3>Imported Goods Should Be Marked with the Name of the Country of Origin With Durability</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce yesterday received an order from the City Social Bureau transferring an order from the National Government amending Article 1 of the Regulations on the Marking of the Country of Origin of Imported Goods as follows: All imported goods and their containers and packaging shall be marked in a conspicuous place with the name of the country of origin in clear Chinese characters. The marking shall be durable. However, in case of difficulty, the name of the country of origin may be marked in the language of the country of origin.</p>
<p>After Repeated Warnings, the Rubber Industry Will Convene a Representative Assembly on a Fixed Date</p>
<h3>To Strive for Ways to Deal With the Factory's Order to Move</h3>
<p>The New Voice Newspaper reported that after the Public Concession Bureau of Public Works Department ordered the Yiyuan Rubber Factory to cease operations and relocate, all circles paid attention to it. The Tianxing, Hongda, Dade, Shanghai Industrial, Zhengda, and Dadong factories have successively received orders to move or warnings. The Rubber Industry Association specially held a meeting yesterday to decide to hold a representative assembly to discuss coping measures. Details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Warning Separately</h3>
<p>The Tianxing Rubber Factory on Qiqihar Road, the Hongda Rubber Factory on Tuopeng Road, and the Dade Rubber Factory on Kunming Road, have all received letters from the Bureau of Public Works stating that because the building facilities are incomplete, they must stop working within three weeks or face prosecution. As for the Shanghai Industrial Rubber Factory on Dongyouheng Road, the Zhengda Rubber Factory on Kunming Road, and the Dadong Rubber Factory, the fire brigade and the Public Works Department of the Bureau of Public Works sent foreigners to each of them to issue warnings, ordering them to improve their facilities immediately.</p>
<h3>Letter to Hongda Factory</h3>
<p>The Bureau of Public Works sent a letter to the Hongda Rubber Factory on Tuopeng Road on June 30th, stating that, as a notice, the Bureau of Public Works sent the final notice number 3855 on March 18th, directing your factory to pay attention to removing all unauthorized buildings. On May 15th, your representative met with the bureau member and it was decided that the buildings were not suitable for a rubber factory and that they must be closed down. According to the report by a bureau member, the factory has still disregarded the fact that explosions and fires have occurred in rubber factories recently and has not taken effective measures to move to a suitable building or to work in manufacturing by applying the most dangerous raw materials and incomplete buildings. Such situations are prone to fire and endanger life and property. The Bureau does not allow such a hazardous business to be established without sufficient and appropriate protection equipment. It is hereby notified that your factory must stop within three weeks; otherwise, a lawsuit will be filed in accordance with the law to avoid danger to the public. If your factory wishes to establish a rubber factory in the Public Concession, the design of the building and the layout of the machines must be drawn up and submitted to the Engineering Department of the Bureau of Public Works for approval. Please do not delay.</p>
<h3>Public Association Report</h3>
<p>The Dad, Tianxing, and Hongda factories, after receiving a letter from the Public Works Department, submitted a report yesterday to the Rubber Association, requesting a general meeting to address the original letter. The letter stated: "We hereby inform you that the Public Works Department, using the accidents at the Zhengtai and Yonghe factories as a pretext to avoid future dangers, is warning the industry, forcing a work stoppage, and ordering relocation. While this action appears to be for public safety and the protection of life, the wording is highly admirable, but the result is quite the opposite. It is a direct attempt to destroy our national industry. However, our industry and commerce are entirely concentrated in Shanghai. Those who can build their own factories and meet factory equipment standards are probably less than five percent, with small capital being the majority. How can they afford to buy land and build factories? The Public Works Department's actions are simply forcing our colleagues to close their factories. We are therefore writing to request your association to convene a general meeting quickly to discuss countermeasures, and we are deeply grateful for your assistance."</p>
<h3>Association Deliberations</h3>
<p>The Rubber Industry Association held a special informal meeting at its headquarters yesterday afternoon at 4:30 PM. Attendees included Li Jianshan of Tianxing, Wang Shirong of Hongda, Huang Yongqin of Yiyuan, Yu Qiusheng of Dade, Mao Yuting, Wan Xuefang, and others. Mao Yuting, as chairman, first reported the details of the Public Works Department's overreach in ordering the relocation of members' factories such as Yiyuan. Then, discussions began: (1) Yu Qiushan of Dade proposed a resolution on the procedures and steps for handling the Public Works Department's forced work stoppage. The resolution was (secret). (2) Wang Shirong of Hongda proposed that, due to the extreme urgency of the matter, the association convene a special general membership meeting in the near future to discuss how to proceed with the case. The resolution was to hold a membership representative meeting at 4:00 PM on the seventh of this month. (3) The Municipal Industrial Safety Association has been established; a resolution was passed unanimously to join and request assistance.</p>
<h3>Industry Representatives Express Opinions</h3>
<p>According to Mao Yuting, a standing committee member of the Rubber Industry Association, speaking to a reporter from the New Voice News Agency, "The Public Works Department's actions this time seem excessively drastic. Even if some factories have inadequate equipment, they should be given instructions for improvement. Instead, they are issuing warnings and ordering relocation. The land in Shanghai is expensive, and most small businesses rent premises. Where would they find large-scale factories? There are about forty rubber businesses, and due to overproduction in recent years, most are operating at a loss. Now, because of the disasters at the Yonghe and Zhengtai factories this year, the Public Works Department is ordering all factories to close. The association has scheduled a meeting for the seventh to discuss countermeasures. Tomorrow (i.e., today), the Industrial Safety Association will hold a meeting, and this association will also bring this up for discussion and request assistance."</p>

<h3>New Regulations for Sealing and Guaranteeing Bulk Silver Shipments at the Bund Banks</h3>
<p>All Silver in Storage at China and Communications Banks to be Re-Sealed</p>
<p>The New Voice News Agency reports that since the abolition of taels and the implementation of the silver dollar standard, the Central Mint's new coins have been issued and are circulating in the market. To facilitate collection and smelting of mint bars, the Bund banks have decided, through meetings, to require all silver dollars issued by the banks on the Bund to be sealed to guarantee their authenticity. Details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Sealing Guarantee</h3>
<p>Since the abolition of silver taels and sycee, the Bund banks now deal exclusively in silver coins, with each box containing 5,000 yuan. The inspection process has proven inconvenient, so after several meetings, it was decided that all banks issuing funds through the Bund banks must seal them to guarantee their authenticity. This practice has already been implemented the other day. The China, Communications, Qianye Joint Reserve, and Four Bank Reserve banks on the Bund are resealing all their silver dollars in storage. However, the new coins</p>
<h3>Various Organizations Prepare to Welcome Anti-Japanese Heroes</h3>
<p>Li Du and Wang Delin Arrive in Shanghai on the Eighth</p>
<p>The Preparatory Committee for the welcome of Anti-Japanese Heroes Ma Zhanshan and Su Bingwen by various organizations in the city is scheduled to hold a grand welcome at the City Chamber of Commerce at 1:00 PM on the 12th of this month. It is learned that General Li Du, accompanied by General Wang Delin, has already returned to Shanghai from Hong Kong aboard the Comte Verde, which is scheduled to arrive on the eighth. The committee sent letters to various organizations yesterday, requesting them to send representatives and prepare flags to welcome them at the dock. The original letter is recorded as follows: "We hereby inform you that the welcome date for Anti-Japanese Heroes Ma Zhanshan, Su Bingwen, Li Du, and Wang Delin has been decided by the fourth preparatory committee meeting as follows: (1) A welcome rally will be held on the 12th of this month from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM. (B) A banquet will be held at 6:00 PM. (C) The number of participants from each organization must be reported by the 10th of this month for registration and the issuance of admission tickets. (D) Those wishing to attend the banquet must pay a meal fee of one yuan per person, which must also be paid at the time of registration, as seating is limited and temporary participation will not be possible. (2) The venue for the rally will be the Tianhou Palace Bridge City Chamber of Commerce hall and meeting rooms. (3) Each organization is requested to notify its members, shops, and citizens to display the county flag on that day to express their welcome." The corresponding decision is hereby recorded and conveyed to you for your information and action. Please let us know the number of participants and register in advance. Furthermore, according to the decision of the third preparatory committee meeting, participating organizations must pay a welcoming rally fee of five yuan per organization, which is requested to be sent to the committee immediately for application. Please do not delay.</p>
<h3>Javanese Overseas Chinese Inspection Team Visits Shanghai Factories</h3>
<p>Recognizes Considerable Development in the Motherland's Industry</p>
<p>Factory Treatment and Equipment Need Urgent Improvement</p>
<p>The Netherlands East Indies (Java) Industrial Inspection Team arrived in Shanghai at the beginning of last month and visited Hangzhou and Nanjing before returning to Shanghai. A reporter from the New New News Agency visited the team in transit yesterday to inquire about their experiences, which are recorded below:</p>
<h3>Organizational Motivation</h3>
<p>The chairman of the Javanese Overseas Chinese Youth Association of Silicon Valley, Mr. and Mrs. Ye Weiheng, and Mrs. Tu Bingli, believing that the Javanese overseas Chinese population is large and mainly engaged in local products, with no considerable development in various industries, initiated the Java Overseas Chinese Industrial Inspection Team. In addition to Mr. and Mrs. Ye Weiheng and Mrs. Xu Bingli, the team included Mr. and Mrs. Shi Weikang, Chen Ruiji, and Shi Ruizhen, a total of seven people. They arrived in Shanghai on the Italian Comte Rosso at the beginning of last month. After a short rest, they visited Hangzhou and Nanjing before returning to Shanghai to conduct on-site inspections of various factories in the city.</p>
<h3>Factory Visits</h3>
<p>The team visited the Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company, Guang Sheng Hang, Guangdong Brothers Company, Meiya Silk Weaving Factory, Samsung Cotton Weaving Factory, China Chemical Industry Company, Home Industry Company, Taikang Cannery, Tianchu MSG, Tiansheng Flavoring Factory, and China Enamel Factory, among others. Since yesterday, all team members have been visiting various yarn factories in the city. The actual situation obtained from the inspections has been written into a report and mailed to the Nanyang Star Newspaper for disclosure.</p>
<h3>Impressions from the Inspection</h3>
<p>The New New News Agency reporter met with Mr. Ye Weiheng and Mrs. Jin Bingli yesterday to ask about their impressions from the inspection. They stated that the purpose of the visit was to inspect the development of the motherland's industry and had no political implications or other background. After days of inspection, they felt that the quality of the silk woven by the Meiya Silk Weaving Factory was strong and lustrous, and its various structures surpassed imported products. The various enamel products of China Enamel were sturdy and durable, and the various cosmetics of Guang Sheng Hang had excellent color and fragrance. The bathrobes, towels, undershirts, trousers, and towels of Samsung Cotton Weaving Factory were white and pure, reaching the highest standard of the cotton weaving industry. Other industries also have considerable development. Therefore, although the motherland has suffered from years of natural disasters and man-made calamities, it has still been able to work hard to make the industry increasingly refined. Silver dollars from the Central Mint are sealed and certified by the review committee and are exempt from sealing.</p>
<h3>Mint Bars</h3>
<p>After the new coins from the Central Mint were issued by the Central Bank, the China Communications and other banks, as well as the Qianye Joint Reserve, have received the new coins for exchange. The Mint has minted bars according to the legal fineness and weight, with each bar equivalent to one thousand yuan. After being tested by the Review Committee, they can be issued.</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese are delighted to see this good phenomenon. Therefore, the result of this inspection is satisfactory to me. After returning to Nanyang, I will promote it as a reference for others. However, what I regret in the satisfaction is that the treatment of workers in various factories seems harsh, and the safety equipment for workers is too simple. Wages should be increased. According to the findings of the inspection, in the state of increasing living standards, the daily sweat and toil is still not enough for a full meal. This should be noted again and again. The employment of underage child labor should be prohibited for heavy work so as not to hinder their development. In addition, there is one thing that I think is inappropriate, that is, rickshaw drivers are living like cattle and horses every day, which is really tragic. I hope that industrialists will gradually increase factories so that rickshaw drivers can abandon their cattle and horse lives and have the opportunity to work in factories. This is what I pray for. The reporter then asked when they would leave Shanghai and return to Java. They said that they would stay for a few more days and then go to Xiamen, Guangzhou, and Shantou before returning to Java.</p>
<h3>Current Situation in Java</h3>
<p>When the reporter inquired about the current situation in Java, it was said that the Nanyang Islands are divided into Dutch and British territories. Java Meriduo is Dutch territory with a population of approximately one million, mostly engaged in local products. The products are tropical, so the production of fruits is very abundant, and the production of yarn, cloth, and coffee is also considerable. Because the overseas Chinese in the vicinity lack knowledge, there is no active development of foreign trade. There are more than 20 middle schools and 400-500 primary schools established by pure overseas Chinese, but no universities have been established. Malay is mostly used, and the income tax is progressive, averaging about 10%. The luxury tax is higher. In addition, the local government does not levy special taxes on overseas Chinese and treats them the same as the Javanese.</p>
<h3>Japanese Coal Floods the Shanghai Market</h3>
<p>According to a report in the Japanese Shanghai Daily on the 5th, from June 8th to July 4th, in less than a month, Shanghai ordered 21,620 tons of large-scale Japanese coal. 6,000 tons of which have been shipped to Shanghai, as follows: Mitsui Yoko's Miike coal: 9,530 tons; Kishima coal: 3,320 tons; Yamashita Yoko's Iwao coal: 1,520 tons; Koyama Trading Company's Manpu coal: 1,560 tons; Mitsubishi Corporation's Sakito coal: 1,650 tons; Miyoshi and Yotsubuchi Yoko's Takao coal, Kanda coal, and Sengens coal: 4,030 tons. Total: 21,620 tons.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Manufacturers Participate in Qingdao National Exhibition, Departed Yesterday</h3>
<p>A Total of 111 Companies, Over 400 Employees</p>
<p>Goods Packed in Over 1,900 Boxes</p>
<p>The Shanghai Citizens Promoting National Goods Association and the China National Goods Maintenance Association led the Shanghai National Goods Touring Group to participate in the 4th Qingdao National Goods Exhibition. All 111 factories and over 430 employees departed simultaneously yesterday morning on the Pu'an and Minsheng ships. The group was led by Wang Jiean and Li Jianyue. Over 1,900 boxes of goods from various factories were entrusted to Yishun Sheng Customs Brokerage on Jiangxi Road, which specially hired the Shengli ship for transportation. It is learned that the factories participating in the Wenzhou National Exhibition also returned to Shanghai yesterday morning. The association stipulates that all registered factory employees will travel to Qingdao on the Yihe Zesheng ship with Secretary Huang Mengtu tomorrow to attend the opening ceremony on the 10th and inquire with the Qingdao Exhibition about whether it is possible to expand the venue to accommodate the factories participating in the Wenzhou Exhibition.</p>
<h3>Official from the Finance Bureau Talks about House Tax on Roads Built Beyond the Settlement</h3>
<p>Yesterday, an official from the Finance Bureau talked about the house tax on roads built beyond the settlement in North Sichuan Road. Personnel have been dispatched to start collecting it. Regarding the rebuttals in yesterday's newspapers from various shops regarding Director Cai's statements, reasonable people will be able to distinguish whether they are justifiable, and there is no need for the bureau to correct them. In short, their purpose is nothing more than to avoid their obligations. No matter how much they try to dress it up with strong arguments, they will still be unable to escape public opinion. Regarding the statement in the newspapers that Councilor Yu is willing to mediate, Councilor Yu also believes that paying taxes is an obligation that citizens should fulfill. As for the statement attributed to Director Cai that "the area was not directly affected by the artillery fire," Director Cai did not make such a statement during his discussions with reporters the other day, and it is likely a misunderstanding. Furthermore, the exemption of house tax for the spring and summer seasons of the 21st year in the Zhabei war zone has long been ordered, and the shopkeepers there have not paid the tax, so how can they use this as an excuse?</p>
<h3>Exterior of the January 28th Memorial Hall Completed</h3>
<p>Completion Ceremony to be Held Next Month</p>
<p>Central News Agency reports that the exterior construction of the January 28th Memorial Hall, one of the new buildings of the Songhu Garrison Command, has been completed, but the interior equipment is still incomplete. The completion ceremony must be held next month. A reporter from the Central News Agency visited Mr. Zheng, a member of the memorial hall preparatory committee, yesterday and learned the following:</p>
<h3>Interior and Exterior Arrangement</h3>
<p>The construction cost of the January 28th Memorial Hall is only several thousand yuan, but it is already quite impressive. The hall can accommodate 500-600 people and can be used for gatherings. The right side and front of the hall will be planted with trees and flowers to create a small-scale garden, which will be open once a year to give people the opportunity to admire it. Materials related to the battle have been collected from all sides, such as statistical tables, war trophies, and written records, photographs, and paintings. Many of these items have already been sent, and more will be collected to make it perfect.</p>
<h3>War Oil Paintings</h3>
<p>The most important part of the interior arrangement is the large oil painting of the January 28th battle. The artist Zhang Yunqiao has been hired to paint a total of seven paintings, one of which is the largest, and the other six are painted on the walls. The largest painting depicts the fierce fighting near the Commercial Press on Baoshan Road in Zhabei. The other six paintings depict: 1. The emergency meeting of the Garrison Command; 2. The attack on Tiantong Temple; 3. The Battle of Wusong; 4. The Battle of Caojia Bridge; 5. The Battle of Jiangwan; 6. The Battle of Liuhang. These oil paintings must be completed before the completion ceremony at the latest. It is said that Mr. Zhang Yunqiao plans to ask someone to help him paint due to time constraints, so that he can complete them as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Negotiations Continue Yesterday on the Five-Cent Call Fee for Chinese-Rented Lines, No Results</h3>
<p>Director Xu Says the Chinese Side Will Decide to Cancel it Automatically</p>
<p>Hoping that Citizens in the Settlements Will Voluntarily Take Action and Negotiate</p>
<p>The New Voice News Agency reports that the Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Communications and the Shanghai Telephone Company have a temporary agreement for telephone calls on Chinese-rented lines. According to Article 11 of the agreement, each call is charged five cents for every three minutes, and calls lasting less than three minutes are also charged the same rate. The bureau believes that this is inconvenient for Chinese-rented line users in the long run, so it has negotiated with the Shanghai Telephone Company to cancel it. After a period of several weeks, it has not been resolved. It is learned that the bureau originally planned to hold the third round of negotiations with the Shanghai Telephone Company last week, but it was a holiday that day, so they did not meet. The meeting was rescheduled for yesterday. The bureau sent engineer Yu yesterday morning to negotiate with the Shanghai Telephone Company to cancel this call fee. The company's deputy manager, a Westerner named Tritschman, received them. The two sides argued for about an hour, but the company still did not agree and refused to cancel this call fee. Therefore, engineer Yu returned to the bureau without obtaining any results. According to Director Xu Xueyu, the company still has no sincerity. In order to facilitate telephone calls on Chinese-rented lines, the bureau is willing to make huge sacrifices and decide to automatically cancel the call fee for Chinese lines first. The implementation date is not far away. As for the rights and interests of users in the settlements, it is hoped that users will unite and negotiate with the Shanghai Telephone Company. At the same time, the bureau will still do its best to negotiate to get it canceled.</p>
<h3>The Problem of Disconnected Lines at the Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Communications is Fully Restored, Temporarily Concluding</h3>
<p>Beijing-Shanghai Lines to Increase in October</p>
<p>The Nationalist News Agency reports that the Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Communications has been approved by the Ministry to appropriately increase telephone fees after converting to automatic machines, but the City Chamber of Commerce is quite opposed to it, resulting in a wave of disconnections. According to Director Xu Xueyu, this matter is no longer a problem and can be concluded. In addition, the Beijing-Shanghai long-distance telephone line is scheduled to be increased in October. Details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Disconnection Problem Temporarily Concluded</h3>
<p>According to Director Xu, the bureau naturally treats telephone users equally. Anyone who fails to pay their telephone bill for more than one month will have their line disconnected. The Chamber of Commerce's opposition to the increase in telephone fees has been understood after the bureau sent personnel to explain, and they have paid the telephone bills at the new price. Therefore, the lines of Chamber of Commerce members will naturally be restored. The handling fee of five yuan is specially waived for preferential treatment. As for non-Chamber of Commerce users, there was no disconnection problem, so this matter is no longer a problem and can be temporarily concluded.</p>
<h3>Beijing-Shanghai Line to be Increased in October</h3>
<p>There are currently three Beijing-Shanghai long-distance telephone lines. Because they are not enough for use, the Ministry of Communications has specially ordered the bureau to plan for expansion. It has now been decided to increase four lines, bringing the total to seven (but some of these lines do not run directly to Beijing and Shanghai and are limited to use between stations). All materials have been purchased by the Ministry of Communications Material Procurement Committee at a price of approximately 500,000 yuan. They are scheduled to arrive in Shanghai in October this year and begin installation. It should be completed by the end of the year, which will greatly facilitate the transmission of news between Beijing and Shanghai.</p>
<h3>British Warship to Conduct Artillery Trials in Tongsha Today</h3>
<p>A Letter was Sent to Military and Government Agencies in this Port Yesterday for Information</p>
<p>The British warship HMS Amedston, stationed in Shanghai, is scheduled to conduct artillery trials on the Tongsha waters on Thursday and Friday of this week. The captain of the warship specially asked the British Consul General in Shanghai yesterday to send letters to the Shanghai Municipal Government, the Songhu Garrison Command, and other agencies for information.</p>
<h3>Japanese Warship Tenryu Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>To Replace the Izumo Flagship</p>
<p>According to the Japanese Shanghai Daily, the Izumo of the Third Fleet has sailed downstream from the upper reaches of the Yangtze River and will arrive in Shanghai on the 10th. The warship will soon sail back to Sasebo for repairs and will be replaced by the Tenryu as the flagship of the Third Fleet.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Shipping Mutual Aid Association Sends Telegram to Southwest Political Committee Regarding Wusong Ship Case Yesterday</h3>
<p>Requesting Swift Resolution</p>
<p>The New Voice News Agency reports that since the Wusong ship case of Taikoo Company was transferred to Guangdong for negotiation, the situation has become increasingly serious. The Shanghai Shipping Mutual Aid Association believed that the Guangdong Seamen's Association's statement contained many fabrications and attacks. In order to clarify the situation and appeal for a prompt resolution, it sent a telegram to the Southwest Political Affairs Committee and the Foreign Affairs Inspection Office on its behalf yesterday, stating: (Titles omitted) "The long-standing practice of the tea room on ships is known to all, and public opinion is clear. It seems unnecessary for the association to harp on it. According to reports, the Guangdong Seamen's Association stated that the Wusong ship case of Taikoo Company was originally attempted to be resolved in Shanghai and Wuhan, but it was sabotaged by the Chinese Shipping Mutual Aid Association, which was organized by the comprador class, and had no bottom line for success. It was forced to be transferred to Guangdong, etc." The long accusations are nothing more than erasing the facts and arbitrarily slandering. Under the leadership of the party and government organs, the association is in compliance with their intentions and dares not overstep its boundaries. At the beginning of the occurrence of the case, it held meetings to mediate, but both parties' attitudes were firm, and it was not only impossible to mediate, but it was also deeply involved in the various criticisms of both parties. The facts are all there to falsely accuse the association and the business director. It is not enough to falsely accuse the association and the business director. In the absence of national law, it seems inappropriate to allow the association to sabotage from it, the business director's abuse and oppression, and Taikoo Company's deliberate reorganization, so that the Shanghai-Wuhan incident finally transferred to Guangdong for handling. It does not blame others but falsely accuses the association, which makes the Shanghai-Wuhan authorities unbearable. Now that the case has gone from Shanghai to Wuhan to Guangdong, all of which is Chinese territory, there is no distinction between borders. I urge you to maintain the authority of the country, verify the facts, and quickly resolve the issue to prevent disputes and eliminate hidden dangers. The telegram is trembling and I am extremely frightened and await orders."</p>
<h3>Fang Zhenwu and Liu Guitang Send Telegrams</h3>
<p>The Liaoning-Jilin-Heilongjiang People's Support Association received telegrams from Fang Zhenwu and Liu Guitang yesterday:</p>
<p>(Fang Zhenwu's reply telegram) "I received your respectful telegram, and I am honored by your concern. Our troops have recovered Kangbao, Maichang, and other places, and are approaching Guyuan, Duolun, and other counties in eastern Chahar. I, Zhenwu, am determined to resist Japan and have long had the determination to restore. I am sleeping on my weapons and advancing without retreat. I will report the situation at the front on time to repay your kindness. I hope you will give us assistance and guidance. I am grateful. Fang Zhenwu bows in winter."</p>
<p>(Liu Guitang's telegram) "I am honored to receive your telegram. I have received the order from Commander-in-Chief Feng to be appointed as the commander-in-chief of the 6th Route of the People's Anti-Japanese Allied Army. I am extremely grateful. I took office as commander in Guyuan on the 21st and telegraphed to inform you. I am determined to recover the mountains and rivers. While there is still a breath, this ambition will not change. I beg you, elders, not to abandon me and give me advice. Any small achievements in the future will be your kindness. I respectfully wish you peace. Liu Guitang, Commander-in-Chief of the 6th Route of the People's Anti-Japanese Allied Army, bows."</p>
<h3>Minutes of Joint Meeting of North and South Rice Groups</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Soybean and Rice Industry Association, South Market Office, invited the Rice Group branch to hold a joint meeting at Cuixiu Hall, Yu Garden, in the city on the afternoon of the 2nd of this month. Over one hundred members from the North and South attended. Chairman Zhu Yuxiang reported the purpose of the meeting and submitted the proposals for discussion: (1) A letter from the Husi Trade Union stated that the broker Zhu QiuXiong had established separate regulations, transporting the original bags of white rice from Tongli and other places to Shanghai, priced according to weight instead of using the city's measuring instruments, which hindered the livelihood of our colleagues and requested relief and assistance. "The chairman read the original letter." It was resolved that according to the industry's custom, the North and South regulations should be divided, and the unit of measurement should be the measuring instrument. Those who take samples to view the goods and negotiate the price should set the price according to 200 pounds per bag net. No separate regulations should be established to disrupt the regulations and damage the credit of the measuring instruments of this association. A letter should be sent to the Soybean and Rice Industry Association to inform the South Gang Office to complete all the weight-based transactions before the 10th of this month. All colleagues should be notified that there should be no more weight-based transactions to show respect for industry regulations and business operations. (1) The chairman proposed that the water adulteration by rice boatmen seemed to hinder our colleagues. How should this be rectified? It was resolved that the boatmen's water adulteration damaged the people's food and had been subject to regulations and penalties by the meeting. It is now seen that the penalty set by the Social Bureau is 20 yuan per violation. The disciplinary penalties previously discussed by this association were also inadequate and difficult to implement. The penalty set by the Social Bureau was too light, and it would be difficult to achieve results. It is now proposed that those with rice prices within 10 yuan will be fined 3 jiao per dan, and 13 group leaders from the North and South rice group branches will be designated as rice inspection members. A letter will be sent to the association and forwarded to the Social Bureau for filing. All rice inspection rules will be drafted by Zhu Zixiang and submitted to the Social Bureau for approval. (1) Colleague Chen Ziyi founded an oil extraction factory. Please actively subscribe to shares. It was resolved that the association will temporarily undertake 200 shares, half from the North and half from the South. Yan Xiaoquan and Zhu Zixiang from the South and Zi Sheng and Lu Jingwen from the North were recommended to solicit subscriptions separately to facilitate progress. (1) The association had previously announced that all bonded goods should be charged a wharf fee of 2 fen, with the consignor and consignee each responsible for one fen. However, this has not been implemented yet. Please decide. It was resolved to implement it from the 10th of this month and inform the South Gang Association to take note.</p>
<h3>Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Increase Not Resolved</h3>
<p>Association Notifies All Colleagues to Pay as Usual</p>
<p>Send to the City Chamber of Commerce for License Donation</p>
<p>The tobacco and alcohol license tax in this city is divided into four seasons: spring, summer, autumn, and winter. It is now the time to collect the autumn tax. Representatives from the Tobacco and Alcohol Industry Association went to the Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Collection Office to exchange licenses. The collection office refused to accept them because the grades were inconsistent and should be rectified and increased according to the regulations. After the representatives reported to the association, they convened an emergency meeting of all colleagues and resolved to send the original tax amount to the City Chamber of Commerce for donation. A notice was issued yesterday stating the reason. The notice is recorded as follows: "Notice regarding the tobacco and alcohol license tax for the autumn season of this year is due for collection. The association has sent representatives to bring the summer licenses and the autumn tax to the office to exchange for new licenses. The office refused to accept them, stating that they were acting in accordance with the regulations and that those with inconsistent grades should be rectified and increased before the licenses could be exchanged. According to the office's reply, it clearly contains a plan to increase the amount of the tax. At a time when commerce is declining, how can we endure further oppression? After a joint meeting of the association, it was decided to continue to follow the established procedure of the previous year and notify members to send the old chapters and autumn tax to the Industry Association within two days according to the tax amount printed on the original license to be sent to the City Chamber of Commerce for donation and to avoid harassment and to stabilize commerce. The matter concerns personal interests, so please do not neglect or harm yourselves. This notice is hereby issued."</p>
<h3>Labor and Management Conditions in the Used Clothing Industry Have Been Successfully Concluded</h3>
<p>The Used Clothing Industry Workers' Union sent four representatives to contact the Used Clothing Industry Association Standing Committee, represented by Wu Zhihao, and the conditions committee, represented by Yin Jie fu. They were responsible for acknowledging the necessity for the capital side to fulfill the original labor-management agreement, approving the implementation of the announcement, and hoping to inform the workers to comfort the public. The representatives were satisfied and reported on the seat of the Workers' Representatives Meeting that evening, saying that this victory was due to the Union's leadership in our struggle, and we should still hold on to the spirit of unity to ensure permanent welfare.</p>
<p>The Clothing Industry Association issued a notice yesterday, stating: "Notice regarding the decision of the 45th Executive Committee Meeting that the labor-management agreement conditions of December 15, 1927, continue to be valid. All members must abide by them to show good faith. The record is hereby made and conveyed to you for your information and compliance."</p>
<h3>Discussion of the Alami, a French Postal Ship, Experiencing an Accident</h3>
<p>The Ship Struck a Reef in the Zhoushan Archipelago</p>
<p>Chinese Passengers Suffered Humiliation</p>
<p>A passenger who happened to travel on the Alami from France discussed the circumstances of the ship's accident in the Zhoushan Archipelago, saying: "On May 19th, I boarded the French postal ship Alami, in the fourth-class cabin, from Marseille to return to China. At 9:30 PM on June 22nd, the ship arrived at the Zhoushan Archipelago, and the sea fog was indiscernible. The ship almost entirely struck a reef. Fortunately, the lighthouse sounded an emergency alarm, indicating danger, and immediately turned the rudder. However, the stern of the ship was damaged, with a section of iron plate about ten feet in length broken. Water surged into the cabin, and the ship tilted sharply, threatening to capsize. Warning sirens sounded, indicating extreme danger. Distant fishing boats from the islands vied to light fires to signal for rescue. Then, I and other passengers, wearing life jackets, rushed to the second-class deck at lifeboat number six, waiting for the crew to lower the boat for escape. On the second day after the ship departed from France, there had been a drill, and the sixth lifeboat was designated on the deck by the fourth-class steward. At the time, I was helping two female classmates to flee there barefoot to reassure them when suddenly a Frenchman wearing a white uniform came to block us, shouting for passengers to quickly roll down. I was about to answer in French, willing to comply, when he struck my right cheek with his fist. Then he shouted, 'Pay attention!' Because there were many Chinese laborers on the lowest level of the ladder, and one of them was a female classmate, and I happened to be at the rear, unable to jump down. He then punched my left cheek and kicked my back forcefully. I fell backward in the ladder. Fortunately, I was able to grab onto the ladder rails, avoiding a fatal fall and injury. However, there is still residual pain in the posterior region of the coccyx. After descending to the third-class cabin, he instructed a crew member to lead a French prostitute to publicly mock me. At that time, because the ship was still in danger, I had no choice but to bear the injury and endure it. The next morning, when the ship was slightly stable at 9:30 AM, I and the fourth-class steward negotiated with the captain, asking him to investigate the perpetrator. The captain, in a rage, cursed at me, saying, 'I hit you last night, so what? Don't say more!' He took out a pistol from his boot and threatened, 'Hitting you is being polite. I want to shoot you. Don't say more. Leave quickly!' I was forced to withdraw under duress. I waited until the 24th, when a British ship escorted us to Shanghai, before seeking further negotiation. We were all escaping to the designated lifeboat number six on the deck by responsible personnel. We did not overstep the bounds in any way and had already complied with the order to withdraw without resistance, hindering or disrupting rescue work. Furthermore, the captain has the responsibility to protect the lives of passengers, yet he wantonly and barbarically used his fists and feet on poor fourth-class Chinese. Luckily, after the ship ran aground, the treacherous tide gradually receded, so we were spared the disaster of sinking; otherwise, the lives of dozens of us Chinese would have been in danger. I have already petitioned the Municipal Government to forward a serious protest to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to be sent to the French government, seeking strict punishment for the perpetrator."</p>
<h3>The Ministry of Railways Publishes the Railway Yearbook</h3>
<p>For the purposes of comparison and statistics in railway undertakings and for reference by government offices and society, the Ministry of Railways established the Railway Yearbook Compilation Committee in May of the 1921st year of the Republic.

At the same time, efforts were made to supplement materials and complete unfinished work. The entire book was completed by the end of March and was entrusted to the Shanghai Hanwen Zhengkai Printing Company for printing. The work was completed by the end of May, and the book was published in a high-quality hardcover edition printed on woodfree paper, priced at five yuan per volume. A paperback edition printed on newsprint was priced at three yuan per volume. It is planned that after pre-ordered books have been issued to various agencies under the direct jurisdiction of the Ministry, the remaining books will be sold on the market so that the public may understand the true state of the railway undertaking. Furthermore, the Railway Yearbook contains twenty-two chapters, totaling 1.4 million words, and systematically narrates the history and system of Chinese railways.

<h3>The Judicial Yuan Issues an Interpretation Regarding Accountants Performing Liquidation Duties</h3>
<p>Represents the Parties Involved and Is Not Liable as a Defendant</p>
<p>The Shanghai Accountants Association previously requested the Judicial Yuan to interpret whether an accountant performing liquidation duties, representing a party involved in litigation related to debt, should bear the responsibility of the defendant. Now, a directive has been received from the Shanghai Municipal Social Bureau, forwarded from the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, reference number 18350, which states: "The Executive Yuan's directive number 2659 approves the Judicial Yuan's document number 909, stating that after receiving a referral from your esteemed Yuan requesting clarification of a point of doubt in Article 1 of the Accountants Regulations, the unified interpretation of laws and regulations meeting of our Yuan decided that an accountant acting as a liquidator represents a legal person in the performance of liquidation duties. In litigation, the accountant acts as an agent under procedural law and should not be directly regarded as the party involved. We are pleased to respond with this clarification for your reference." The association has received this explanatory decree and has instructed all members to take note.</p>

<h3>The Deadline for Merchant Participation in the National Silk Exhibition Is Today</h3>
<p>丨It Will Be Difficult to Join After the Deadline, and There Is Insufficient Supply of Display Cases丨</p>
<p>The opening of the China National Silk Exhibition is approaching, and all preparatory matters are being actively carried out. The following are the latest news items received yesterday:</p>
<h3>Deadline for Participation</h3>
<p>The deadline for merchants to participate in the exhibition was the day before yesterday, but more than forty had already joined. Yesterday, more than ten more merchants continued to register, bringing the total to more than sixty. There are only one hundred or so display cases, and they have all been assigned. It is deeply felt that they are insufficient to meet the demand. After a consultation between the Exhibition and Decoration sections, it was decided to allocate them on an equal basis. However, the original deadline for registration was set for today (the 6th). No applications will be accepted after the deadline.</p>
<h3>Exhibition Office Hours</h3>
<p>All matters related to the arrangement of the venue are being handled by the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Commodity Display Center in conjunction with the National Products Department Store. In recent days, the affairs of liaison and arrangement have been extremely busy, and all office hours have been specially extended. The Director-General of the Display Center, Zhu Boyuan, is supervising all staff to speed up work. Decorative arches are being erected at the entrances of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Display Center, and they are working day and night to complete the work, which is very busy.</p>
<h3>Establishment of an Office</h3>
<p>One of the original four sponsoring groups, the Shanghai Silk Industry Bank, has, in view of the fact that the business of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the National Products Department Store will be extremely prosperous during the exhibition, established a temporary office next to the exhibition venue to collect payments, for the convenience of manufacturers and to serve the community. It is also currently being decorated.</p>
<h3>Mr. Liu's Participation</h3>
<p>Liu Weichi, the newly appointed Permanent Vice Minister of the Ministry of Industry, originally planned to go to Beijing immediately after receiving the central government's appointment. Now, because the opening of the exhibition is imminent, Mr. Liu has been able to attend and participate. Therefore, he has postponed his departure for Beijing until Sunday evening (the 9th) and will go to the Ministry on Monday to take up his duties. Mr. Liu has served the Party and the country for a long time and has held important positions such as Director of the Salt Administration of the Ministry of Finance, Deputy Minister of Business of the Ministry of Railways, Director of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Bureaus, and Director of the Ping-Han Railway Bureau. The central government greatly values Mr. Liu's talent, construction skills, and willingness to take responsibility.</p>
<h3>Generous Gifts</h3>
<p>The audience at this exhibition is sure to be very large, and to increase interest, the preparatory office contacted various domestic product manufacturers in advance to distribute gifts. The following is a list of items that have already been decided: Yicheng Tobacco Company will send fans, Huacheng Tobacco Company will send Golden Rat brand cigarettes, Watson's Soda Factory will send soda, Yamei Fresh Fruit Juice Company will send orange juice, Yili Soda Factory will send soda, Fuxin Tobacco Company will send Holmes brand cigarettes, Huaou Candy Company will send candy, Guanshengyuan will send various candies, Lao Jiulun will send fans, Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company will send cigarettes, Wuzhou Soap &amp; Medicine Factory will send sample soaps, Paris Cosmetics Factory will send tooth powder, Zhongfa Pharmacy will send Rendan, Tian Yiwei Mother Plant will send Weimu Juice, and Yonghe Industrial Company will send rubber balls.</p>

<h3>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Sends Letters to the Two Municipal Councils, Asking Them Not to Allow Nude Exercise</h3>
<p>Regardless of Whether the Motivations of the Proponents Are Pure</p>
<p>It Is Sufficient to Lead to a Bad Influence on Young People</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, based on a proposal by Standing Committee member Wang Yansong requesting advance prohibition of nude exercise from Hong Kong coming to Shanghai, yesterday sent separate letters to the Public Concession and French Concession authorities, stating: "According to news reports, a Czech person intends to come to Shanghai to promote nude exercise. Whether this is a fact or merely a rumor is still difficult to determine. However, the law already expressly prohibits people from being naked in public places. Therefore, nude exercise is the same as violating the prohibition and cannot be exempted by claiming that this act is beneficial to physical training. Nowadays, profiteers like to use the term 'sensual' as a slogan to cater to the superficial psychology of society, resulting in Shanghai being rife with acts that are detrimental to public morals, lascivious, and absurd. All Chinese and foreign authorities who are responsible for a part of governance have a responsibility to prevent this kind of malpractice. Our Chamber believes that if this nude exercise is allowed to be imitated in Shanghai, regardless of whether the motives of the proponents are pure, it is sufficient to lead to a bad influence on young people. Accordingly, we are writing to request that your council consider this matter in advance. If this movement is even planning to come to Shanghai to be held in the concession, please do not allow it, so as to avoid the occurrence of significant malpractices. This is our earnest hope."</p>
<h3>Zhang Xinshan, a Secret Agent of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, Assassinated</h3>
<p>Three Thugs Stabbed Him Repeatedly with Fruit Knives</p>
<p>Because There Were Few Pedestrians in the Early Morning, There Was No Way to Resist and He Died</p>
<p>丨The Thugs Left Behind a Murder Weapon Engraved with the Three Characters "Jin Dalong"丨</p>
<p>At 8:50 AM yesterday morning, an assassination occurred at the entrance of Chongde Lane on Avenue Blehini Montmalon in the French Concession. The victim was Zhang Xinshan, a secret agent of the Detective Team of the current Municipal Public Security Bureau. He was stabbed a total of twenty-one times by the murderer(s) and died on the spot. The murderer(s) fled without a trace. The details are described below:</p>
<h3>Originating as a Gangster</h3>
<p>A man named Zhang Xinshan from Anhui Province, twenty-eight years old, has lived in Shanghai for many years and has no family. He has specialized in being a gangster in the area of Montmalon Road, so everyone on Montmalon Road knows of the person known as "Little Anhui." Unexpectedly, Zhang recently obtained an introduction through a friend to the Detective Team of the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau and became secret agent number sixty-two. Although it was an honorary position with no salary, Zhang, who had originated as a gangster, suddenly became a public servant, which he felt was a great honor.</p>
<h3>Very Depressed Life</h3>
<p>According to reports, Zhang previously had no fixed residence, and his residence was wherever he could find a hotel or inn. In March of this year, Zhang took up with a woman and temporarily rented a room on the second floor behind Wu Shuntai Jingji Clothing Store at No. 8 Zhenhua Lane on Montmalon Road. However, within a month, the woman suddenly left him, so Zhang had to live alone. The only furniture in the room was an iron bed, a small table, and two wooden benches.</p>
<h3>Stabbed All Over with a Fruit Knife</h3>
<p>At 8:50 AM yesterday morning, Zhang got up and went out alone. Unexpectedly, as soon as he stepped out of the lane entrance and arrived at the entrance of the first alley of the neighboring Chongyi Lane, three thugs suddenly jumped out from the roadside, blocked Zhang's path, and took out sharp small knives for cutting fruit. They stabbed Zhang all over. At that time, although Zhang was stubborn and tried to resist, he was unarmed and suffered too many injuries. He shouted loudly for help, but unfortunately, it was early morning and the</p>
<h3>Shallow Water and Sunken Ships Obstruct the Northern Navigation Route</h3>
<p>丨The Bai River is Dried Up... Longkou Obstructed丨</p>
<p>Coastal rivers often change, affecting the safety of navigation, which is of great importance to the shipping industry in the northern seas. The following is a compilation by reporters of factors that are obstructing navigation and must be known by the shipping industry, so that all sea vessels can take precautions.</p>
<h3>Bai River Dries Up, Penalties</h3>
<p>The Bai River in Tianjin is affected by the rising waters of the Yongding River, and the downstream flow of sand and mud has caused the riverbed to silt up. The deepest point is no more than nine feet. The Tianjin Customs has long prohibited navigation. The Northern Sea liners from Shanghai have all changed their routes to Tanggu. Unexpectedly, since the 2nd of this month, the water level of the Yongding River has risen further, and the upstream silt and sand have rushed down into the Bai River, causing the water in the Bai River to dry up even more, and the sediment in the river has risen higher. Since the 3rd, the water volume has decreased again, and the highest point is now less than eight feet. As a result, ships often have accidents in the port, blocking traffic. The Tianjin Customs has specially issued strict regulations and penalties. Any ship sailing on the Bai River that is too heavy and runs aground in the river will be fined one thousand taels of silver by the customs. If it runs aground on the banks of the Bai River, it will be fined five hundred taels of silver. This new penalty regulation was telegraphed to the Shanghai shipping companies yesterday, ordering them to inform all sea vessels.</p>
<h3>Sunken Ship in Longkou Obstructs Navigation</h3>
<p>Longkou is an important port in North China and is also the sea route that northern ships must pass through to reach Yantai. There are many ships coming and going. At 169 degrees directly north of the Qimu Island lighthouse at the port of Longkou, at a distance of 1.39 nautical miles, at 120 degrees 14 minutes east longitude and 37 degrees 39 minutes north latitude, a Cheng Sheng No. 2 engine fishing boat encountered danger while sailing from Yantai and ran aground on a submerged reef and sank. However, it was impossible to salvage. The hull of the ship in the sea obstructs navigation. The Longkou Customs has specially telegraphed to Shanghai to inform all ships that they must pay extra attention when arriving in Longkou to avoid being hit by the sunken ship and causing major danger. At the same time, markers were added at the time of the shipwreck and included in the nautical chart.</p>
<h3>Wang Fenggang Conspired with a Westerner of Unknown Nationality to Establish a Joint Coupon Company to Collect Money</h3>
<p>Joint Coupons Can Never Be Redeemed for Cash</p>
<p>A Lot of the Employee's Security Deposits Were Also Scavenged</p>
<p>Wang Fenggang, an Hubei native, colluded with a Westerner of unknown nationality in March of this year to establish the China Trade Joint Coupon Company at No. 19 Yuanmingyuan Road. Wang himself served as comprador and immediately posted recruitment advertisements in newspapers. Generally, the unemployed believe that opportunities to make a living are rare, and they have come to register one after another, each stating their strengths, hoping to be hired. Wang based the amount of salary given on the amount of security deposit paid by them. The security deposit ranged from one hundred yuan to six hundred yuan. To date, it has been more than two months, and there have been more than sixty registrants. The security deposit paid ranged from one hundred yuan to three or five hundred yuan, so Wang's income was extremely abundant. He then came up with a method of collecting money called "joint coupons." Each full sheet of coupons can be cut into five strips. For example, if someone buys a coupon sheet from him for two yuan and five cents, the buyer will sell the strips separately for five cents each. After selling them all, they will bring the retained full sheet to the company. If the company verifies that all five strips that have been sold have been exchanged for coupons, then this coupon is worth eleven yuan, and the company will take back the coupon and give eleven yuan in cash. Each strip can be exchanged for a full sheet of coupons. If calculated according to this surface value, the company would have to lose a lot of money for each coupon it sells, and there is no profit to be made. In fact, this is not the case. Even if the company collects all five strips, it can claim that it has only received four strips or two or three strips. Although the coupon is printed with the words "redeemable for eleven yuan in cash," it is nothing more than a discarded ticket that will never be exchanged for cash. This kind of swindle is quite novel and unique, and people with simple minds are most easily fooled. Therefore, since its issuance, the money swindled is also considerable. However, it has not yet been reported, and it can continue to be implemented. However, many of the employees who were recruited now feel that they are simply holding empty titles such as running errands and writing letters, without any work, and the salaries that were set have not been paid at all. They are deeply suspicious of Wang. At the end of last month, an employee surnamed Qiu was the first to see through Wang's dark secrets and immediately filed a lawsuit with the First Special District Local Court for fraud. Other employees, such as Zhao Hongmo, Jiang Wein, Zhang Jiashen, Zhang Jiasheng, and Gu Yongshou, have also united and followed in Qiu's footsteps, hiring attorney Le Junfen to accuse Wang of fraud and breach of trust. Wang, seeing that his secret had been revealed and that the huge amount of money he had swindled had long been divided with the Westerner and squandered, could not make up for it and closed the fictitious company yesterday.</p>
<h3>More Than a Hundred Rickshaw Pullers Gathered to Destroy a Truck Transporting Goods</h3>
<p>丨The Momentum Was Huge on Hart Road丨</p>
<p>One Escort Was Seriously Injured</p>
<p>Fourteen Rickshaw Pullers Were Detained</p>
<p>At 7:05 AM yesterday morning, suddenly more than one hundred rickshaw pullers blocked the path of a truck transporting goods near the Shunxingtai Construction Factory at the intersection of Hart Road and Connaught Road. The momentum was huge. With a shout, they all rushed forward, each wielding iron rods and stones, and destroyed the truck. The escort, Chen Zengqi, was seriously injured. Nearby police officers stepped forward to stop them, but to no avail. They urgently telegraphed to the Gordon Road Police Station, and the police chief immediately dispatched a large number of detectives in police vehicles, arriving to arrest the perpetrators. A total of fourteen rickshaw pullers were arrested, along with the destroyed truck, a bicycle, and the injured escort. They were all taken to the police station to await interrogation by the First Special District Court.</p>
<h3>After the Song Tripitaka Pre-Orders Expire</h3>
<p>Since the advertisement for pre-ordering the facsimile of the Song Tripitaka was published in this newspaper, it has been widely publicized at home and abroad. The day of the expiration of the pre-orders was June 30th, and it has been learned that more than ninety copies have been ordered. The most difficult to obtain were Liu Hanyi and the Xujiahui Library. Liu's Jiayetang has a rich collection of books, and its collection of Buddhist scriptures already includes Ming plate, day plate, and Japanese plate editions. There are also fragments of Song plate editions. Now, he has specially taken out a net sum of five hundred and twenty-five yuan to purchase a copy of the Qisha Tripitaka. The Dharma affinity is like the sea, and the merit is accomplished in the forest, truly implying the intention of promotion. The Xujiahui Cathedral Library has long enjoyed a reputation in the world, and it generally possesses Chinese and foreign Buddhist scripture editions. Now, it has been determined that the format of the Qisha Tripitaka is such that one whole piece of the original edition is printed as a half-page without cutting and fitting the lines of text. This preservation of the true appearance of the Song Dynasty scripture edition is very much in line with the wishes of archaeologists. Furthermore, the horizontal format of the scripture is in line with the original palm-leaf binding and the Qing Dynasty Mongolian and Tibetan scripture mantra editions, as well as the current Indian and Tibetan scripture editions. The Qi is connected and the appearance is not different. The library has specially commissioned Mr. Xu Songnian to order a copy from the Facsimile Song Plate Tripitaka Society (714 Weihaiwei Road, Shanghai) to be displayed according to type. The above is a rough overview. The initiators, Zhu Ziqiao, Ye Yufu, and Di Chuqing, have received letters from Guangdong, Yunnan, Sichuan, and Shanxi, stating that it is too late to remit money and requesting that the pre-order period be extended. It has been decided to extend it to the end of August of this year. However, only 500 copies will be printed. If the number is fully booked before then, a notice will be posted at any time to terminate the offer. It is not planned to print more copies. The main reason is that the cost is too high. The number of these five hundred copies alone will require more than two hundred thousand yuan. The economy is currently tight, and only with the efforts of all parties can the urgent needs be barely met. To increase the number again will be even more difficult to cope with. However, according to the observations of a certain gentleman, it is appropriate to follow the Dharma affinity. The circulation of facsimile prints of this kind of great ancient book is itself an opportunity to be gained. All those who come from afar to place orders invariably harbor a kind of fervent desire. To collect the money in advance and send it must incur some trouble. If the delay is too long, they will be disappointed and give up, which would greatly violate the original intention of circulation. It is privately argued that even if the number of copies sold exceeds 500, it is still necessary to reprint them to meet the requests of all parties. This is because valuable fine copies are equal to cash as soon as they are printed. The required paper price and printing costs can be discussed with the bank, and they will be happy to make a deposit, so it seems that the economic aspect will not be too difficult.</p>
<p>There were few pedestrians, and the distance to the guard post was far away. Therefore, in a flash, Zhang fell to the ground in a pool of blood and then died. The murderer(s) also took the opportunity to escape without a trace.</p>
<h3>Twenty-One Wounds</h3>
<p>After someone reported the incident, the patrolman notified the police station. The police chief immediately ordered Detective Wang Licheng to rush to the scene for inspection. He saw the deceased lying face down on the ground, with his head pointing west and his feet pointing east, wearing a silk shirt and pants and yellow leather shoes and sauce-colored silk socks. There were a total of twenty-one wounds all over his body, including two cuts on the left neck, six cuts on the left rib, one cut on the right rib, five cuts on the back, one cut on the right kidney, four cuts on the left hand, and one cut on the back of the head. A murder weapon was found two feet away from the corpse, with the three characters "Jin Dalong" engraved on the blade. Detective Wang then returned to report to the police chief and notified his colleagues at the Auxiliary Yuan Branch to send a police officer to carry the corpse to the autopsy room to await examination.</p>
<h3>Speculation About the Murder</h3>
<p>When the police station went to investigate, they initially did not know who it was. After they found a secret agent's license, a stack of banknotes, and many cards in the deceased's pocket and were identified by nearby neighbors, they learned that the deceased was indeed named Zhang Xinshan. At the same time, Detective Team Leader Lu Ying also heard the news and sent personnel to rush to the scene. According to reports, although Zhang had not been serving for long since he joined, he had been very diligent. For example, Zhang was responsible for the major theft den that the Detective Team and the police station jointly cracked at Hart Road a few days ago, seizing many box cannons and arresting three thieves. His tragic death may have been due to the jealousy of the bandits.</p>
<h3>Anniversary of the Silk Industry Bank Expansion</h3>
<p>丨Specially Ordered New Anniversary Savings Regulations丨</p>
<p>Since the establishment of the Savings Department of the Silk Industry Bank on Hankou Road, its business has been flourishing due to its outstanding reputation, resulting in the fact that the original business address was insufficient to meet the demand. The westernmost shop was specially taken back, and Chen Haiyan, an architect, was commissioned to design and construct the large Suzhou stone building by the Xinjinji Kang Company. It has now been completed. Today is the anniversary of the bank's establishment, and the Savings Department is moving to its new address. It is heard that the bank has newly ordered anniversary savings regulations with very favorable methods. The interest rate for one-year fixed deposits is set at one percent per week. To increase the interest of depositors, the bank has specially prepared exquisite gifts. All new depositors will receive gifts in accordance with the regulations.</p>
<h3>Ningbo Industrial Bank Expansion</h3>
<p>丨Capital Increase and Subscription are Enthusiastic丨</p>
<p>Since its establishment in October of the 20th year of the Republic, the Ningbo Industrial Bank of Shanghai has been quite prosperous in its business. It has been actively engaged in supporting industrial and commercial enterprises and national product mobilization guarantees, fully embracing the purpose of serving society and fulfilling the responsibility of financial adjustment. In order to develop fisheries and agricultural production and facilitate remittances for fishermen along the coast, it has specially established branches in Ningbo and Shenjiamen to operate all businesses, which are booming day by day. It is heard that in order to expand its business, the bank has resolved at the first shareholders' meeting to increase its capital by 250,000 yuan. After the board of directors of this session deliberated on the method, they began to proceed. It is heard that the bank's shareholders are enthusiastically continuing to increase their shares and have already collected the amount. It is planned that after the capital increase is fully collected, another 250,000 yuan will be added to form a capital of one million yuan to expand business and facilitate operations.</p>
<h3>Construction Lottery Draw Date Approaching</h3>
<p>Three Mechanical Balls to Be Used for Drawing</p>
<p>Three-Fourths of Lottery Tickets Sold</p>
<p>丨Shanghai Distribution Points to Close on July 25th丨</p>
<p>The first phase of the National Government's Aviation Highway Construction Lottery is scheduled to be drawn at a large theater in Shanghai on the 31st of this month. The method of drawing is expected to be of interest to people from all walks of life. A reporter specially drove to the lottery office on Avenue Edward VII to meet with a senior official, who kindly led the reporter to inspect the drawing machines and balls, providing a detailed explanation. According to the official, three copper balls are used for the drawing. These three mechanical balls are mounted on iron bases, with semicircular steel frames around them, allowing them to rotate freely. Inside each mechanical ball are numerous wooden agitators and copper gears. When the mechanical ball rotates, the wooden agitators push the small balls inside through the copper gears for even mixing. The top and bottom of each mechanical ball are fitted with butterfly-type spring valves. Each time the spring is opened, a small ball is released, turning into a long oval glass container along the copper slot on the iron base. The mechanical balls are divided into A, B, and C. Mechanical ball A contains 667 small balls, with one ball engraved with a character (representing the first prize, and so on), two balls engraved with two characters, four balls engraved with three characters, ten balls engraved with four characters, fifty balls engraved with five characters, one hundred balls engraved with six characters, and five hundred balls engraved with seven characters. The number of small balls in this mechanical ball matches the total number of winning lottery tickets from the first prize to the seventh prize, totaling 667. Mechanical ball B contains 5,000 small balls, engraved with numbers from 0000 to 4999, representing the first four digits of the winning lottery number, totaling 5,000 numbers. Mechanical ball C contains 100 small balls, engraved with numbers from 00 to 99, representing the last two digits of the winning lottery number, totaling 100 numbers. When the drawing takes place, in addition to the Lottery Committee sending a supervisory committee to supervise the event together with representatives from the local court, Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, and Bankers' Association, the auditorium will be open half an hour before the drawing to welcome people from all walks of life to inspect the machines and small balls. After the inspection is completed, the small balls will be injected into each mechanical ball. The three mechanical balls will be rotated multiple times to mix the small balls evenly, then the spring of the valve will be opened to release a small ball. The numbers drawn from mechanical balls B and C are read together to form the winning lottery number. The number drawn from mechanical ball A represents the winning grade. The numbers of the small balls drawn from mechanical balls B and C are re-injected into each mechanical ball after reporting and registration. However, the numbers drawn from mechanical ball A are not re-injected until all 667 small balls in mechanical ball A are drawn, at which point the drawing is completed. Now that the drawing date is approaching, the public across the country is expressing sympathy for the lottery, and purchasers are very enthusiastic. As of yesterday, more than three-quarters of the tickets have been sold. It is heard that all distribution points in Shanghai and Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces will be closed on the 25th of this month to stop selling tickets. There are not many tickets left, so purchase must be made quickly.</p>
<h3>Englishman William Accused of Raping Two Young Girls, Sentenced</h3>
<p>Shanghai "The Tientsin Times" reports that Englishman William, accused of raping two young girls, was sentenced yesterday in the British Assize Court to eighteen months of hard labor. It is found that the accused was charged with crimes committed over a period of four months. The defendant also pleaded guilty. Therefore, during yesterday's trial, the defendant's lawyer only asked the court to be lenient, stating that the defendant had lived in the Federated Malay States for most of his life and had received many certificates of good behavior from employers there. Since coming to Shanghai eighteen months ago, he has been unemployed. The judge then declared that no mitigating circumstances were found in the charges against the defendant and sentenced him to one and a half years of imprisonment as a show of leniency.</p>
<h3>Yonghe Company Requests Attention to Inferior Quality Rubber Balls</h3>
<p>Letter to the Municipal Rubber Industry Association</p>
<p>Yonghe Industrial Company sent a letter to the Municipal Rubber Industry Association yesterday, which reads: "Respectfully, recently many rubber toys have been discovered on the market, such as chickens, birds, dogs, and horses, as well as inflatable yellow rubber balls, which are sold on the streets at extremely low prices. When asked about the manufacturer, they claim to be Yonghe Industrial Company. Our company originally had plans to manufacture rubber toys, but after the January 28th Incident, we no longer had the time for this. Currently, our rubber products include galoshes, rain shoes, and small rubber balls for school supplies in large, medium, and small sizes (but not the yellow rubber balls currently found on the market). All of our balls are stamped with the green 'Yong' trademark and have been sold throughout the country for more than six years, and are widely recognized (recent letters from students can prove this). Unexpectedly, there are now counterfeit products being sold on the market. We do not know what the intention is. If the products are indeed domestic goods, they can be sold openly. Why resort to such improper means? Your association leads the industry and has always been committed to maintaining order. Now that these facts have been discovered, we hope that you will find a way to correct them. This would be a great favor to our company and would greatly benefit the future of domestic goods. Respectfully yours, Shanghai Municipal Rubber Industry Association, Yonghe Industrial Company, Sincerely. P.S. Enclosed is a copy of a student's letter. The wording may be flawed, but it shows that outsiders are aware of the yellow rubber balls."</p>
<p>Mr. Director of Yonghe Industrial Factory, Greetings, My classmates often want to use the "Yong" brand rubber balls from your factory, but they are more expensive. Students cannot afford them. Recently, in elementary schools, children are using inferior quality yellow rubber balls, which are very cheap, selling for about twenty cents each and are very large. Many hawkers sell them in the streets and alleys. It seems that your factory's balls must be affected. Patriotic students are really angry. Requested by colleagues at the Chinese Public School of the Mental Department of the Water Department.</p>
<h3>Lawyer Liu Hongxun Found Not Guilty</h3>
<p>The case of Lawyer Liu Hongxun, who represented Taoyuan Restaurant on Fuzhou Road in a rent dispute with the neighboring Yufengtai Hotel in 1920, resulted in Taoyuan's victory. Last year, the two buildings in dispute were seized and occupied. This spring, the owner of Yufengtai, Wang Songtao, suddenly accused Liu of fraud in the First Special District Court, which sentenced Liu to a fine. Liu refused to accept the judgment and immediately appealed to the collegiate bench of the court. After several interrogations by Judge Feng Shide, along with Assessors Qian and Wu, Feng announced the judgment in the First Criminal Court yesterday afternoon, revoking the original judgment regarding Liu Hongxun's crime and declaring Liu Hongxun not guilty.</p>
<h3>Siberian Jewelry Company Stolen Treasures All Company Property</h3>
<p>Only One Diamond Earring Belonged to a Customer</p>
<p>Another Russian Suspect Arrested Yesterday</p>
<p>Since the major theft at the Siberian Jewelry Company on Nanjing Road, there have been rumors that many of the jewelry and gold watches entrusted to the company for repair by customers were also among the stolen items. After a detailed inspection by the company, it was found that all the stolen treasures, except for a pair of diamond earrings, belonged to the company. All items entrusted for repair by customers were safe and sound. Only a pair of diamond earrings, because they were too valuable, were stored in the stolen safe and were also stolen. The total loss is not far from the initially estimated 100,000 yuan. However, the exact amount has not yet been calculated.</p>
<p>Another report states that on the morning of the 3rd of this month, thieves broke into the Siberian Jewelry Company on Nanjing Road by digging through the wall from next door and stole jewelry worth more than 100,000 yuan. After a thorough investigation by the police, a suspect, a Polish man named Stanislaw Ratingchik, was arrested the day before yesterday and handed over to the First Special Court for interrogation and detention. This information has been recorded in this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon, Russian Detective Aushenikov of the General Police Department arrested another Russian man named Karl Sieksy at 1957 Jing'an Temple Road and took him back to the police station for detention. This morning, he was sent to the First Criminal Court. Police Lawyer Ru Baoyi stated that the case is still under investigation, so no charges have been filed against the defendant. He only requested permission to detain him and try him together with Ratingchik. Judge Feng approved the request and ordered the case to be rescheduled and tried together with Ratingchik.</p>

<h3>Police Arrest Gamblers, Someone Drowns, Life Lost</h3>
<p>丨Prosecutor Interrogates Those Involved Yesterday丨</p>
<p>A case of police arresting gamblers and causing a drowning resulting in death occurred in Huijiao, a village in the southwest of this county. The 6th Branch of the County Police Department sent the officers involved, Zhang Rong, Xie Fengshan, Jiang Shouen, Xu Enpei, and Xu Jinhe, a total of five people, to the Shanghai District Court for interrogation and detention pending further investigation. This information has been reported previously. It is now learned that the case was ordered by Prosecutor Wu Deying to summon a number of witnesses for separate interrogations yesterday. Those who arrived included the village chief Zhang Yaokun, Zhang Zhongmei, neighbors Zhu Shungen, witness Hu Huanxiang, teahouse owner Jiang Weishi, the deceased's brother Zhu Huanlin, and the police officers who went to arrest the gamblers, Wang Tiekai, Wang Lizhang, and Hua Kerong. According to Hu Huanxiang, "When the incident occurred, I was fishing in the river when I suddenly heard several gunshots. I didn't know what was happening and rushed to investigate. I saw the deceased, Zhu Quanlin, holding onto a bridge pier in the West Pond River at Huijiao, calling for help. I was about to go forward to rescue him when a policeman kicked me violently, saying, 'Damn it, it's none of your business, get out of here!' I didn't dare to argue. I also saw the police throwing cement blocks (which had been dug out from the river and discarded there) at Zhu Quanlin's head. Zhu immediately let go and sank to the bottom of the river and drowned," and so on. The investigating official ordered the detained Zhang Rong, Xie Fengshan, Jiang Shouen, Xu Enpei, and Xu Jinhe to be brought to court. After questioning them one by one, he ordered Xie Fengshan, Jiang Shouen, and Xu Enpei to be remanded in custody (because the three police officers Xie, Jiang, and Xu were all carrying guns). Zhang Rong and Xu Jinhe were ordered to be detained pending bail. (It was found that Zhang, Xu, and Zhang Tiekai were all in the teahouse opened by Jiang Weishi when the incident occurred). The rest were ordered to leave and await further instructions. However, village chiefs Zhang Yaokun and Zhang Zhongmei stated that it is currently the busy farming season, and the villagers do not have time to gamble. They may rest and drink tea after finishing work in the fields. The family of the deceased has filed an incidental private lawsuit for 2,000 yuan.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Education's Second Order to Rectify Peking University</h3>
<p>Zuo Zonglun and Wu Xiangfeng Have Both Returned to Peking</p>
<p>Each Discusses the Process of Resolving the Peking University Problem</p>
<p>Beijing Special Dispatch After Acting President Xu Songming and the deans of various colleges in Peking University argued with the Minister of Education Wang Shijie in Beijing, the Ministry of Education decided on a compromise solution under the principle of the Ministry's order. In terms of high school students in the art academy, there has been some expression, and the painstaking mediation of the college authorities has reached a considerable limit. The Ministry of Education issued an order and an instruction to Peking yesterday. The content of the order stipulates the closing and reorganization measures of the various colleges, departments, and high schools of Peking University. The content of the instruction is that there is no need to discuss stopping enrollment in the colleges of Commerce and Law. Stopping enrollment is only for one year and is different from the meaning of closing. The details of each party are recorded below.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Directive</h3>
<p>It is found that the aforementioned school's College of Arts has been repeatedly ordered to close, and the deadline has now arrived. All students currently enrolled in the college shall be issued certificates of graduation from a two-year or three-year specialized program by the college. The arrears owed to the faculty and staff of the college should be gradually settled. The salaries for the months of February, March, April, May, and June of the 21st year of the Republic should be handled in accordance with the wartime reduction measures. After the closure, the Ministry will consider using the college's funds to develop art education in North China. Detailed measures will be determined later. Furthermore, the original Department of Philosophy of the Women's College of Arts and Sciences should be renamed the Department of Philosophy and Education. The Department of Chinese Literature, the Department of History and Geography, and the Department of English Literature should be merged into the Department of Literature and History. The Department of Social Sciences should be renamed the Department of Economics, and emphasis should be placed on practical subjects such as statistics, accounting, and banking. The Department of Music should be renamed the Specialized Program in Music, which may enroll junior high school graduates into a two-year preparatory class, after which they will advance to the specialized program for three years, totaling five years of study. The Department of Mathematics should be renamed the Department of Mathematics and Physics. The Department of Chemistry should remain as it is. The Department of Physical Education should be renamed the Specialized Program in Physical Education. Since the college's departments have been reorganized into five departments and two specialized programs, the college should immediately draft course guides for each department and submit them to the Ministry for review and approval. In addition, the original Department of Diplomacy and Consular Affairs, the Department of Border Administration, and the Department of Transportation of the College of Commerce were previously ordered to be renamed the Department of International Trade, the Department of Business Administration, and the Department of Transportation Management. These changes should be implemented immediately, and the curriculum should be submitted to the Ministry for review. Furthermore, the affiliated high school should be closed, and current students should be given certificates of attendance to facilitate their transfer to other schools. This order is hereby issued for prompt compliance and reporting. This order is from the Minister of Education, Wang Shijie.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Instruction</h3>
<p>Ministry of Education Instruction No. 6387: A document submitted by National Peking University, requesting approval for the Department of Political Science of the College of Law and the departments of the College of Commerce to enroll students, has been received. According to the submission, the Ministry previously ordered the College of Commerce and the Department of Political Science of the College of Law to suspend enrollment of new students in order to reorganize existing classes, save funds, and improve content. This differs from closure procedures. The previous order should still be followed, and efforts should be made to rectify the situation. The request to enroll students this year should not be considered. This order is from the Minister of Education, Wang Shijie.</p>
<h3>Post-Closure Measures</h3>
<p>Although the specific measures for the aftermath of the Ministry of Education's order to close Peking University High School have not been clearly stipulated, after inquiring, the so-called new measures reported in the newspapers for the past two days, according to relevant sources, are said to be reliable. Once President Xu (Songming) returns to Peking, further discussions and consultations will be held, which should lead to a good resolution. Let us wait and see. According to the new measures: (1) After the high school is closed, the student transfer issue will be handled by the middle school, with the original teachers continuing to teach the courses. Students in the Russian language class will be transferred to the College of Commerce for classes, and subsidies will be provided. (2) The students enrolled last year in various levels may be approved for filing after President Xu of Peking University states the reasons.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Education Orders the Promulgation of Outlines for Guidance on Further Education and Career Paths for Primary and Secondary School Graduates</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education issued a circular to the education departments and bureaus of all provinces and cities, stating: It has been found that in recent years, primary and secondary school students in various provinces and cities have been unable to make their own decisions about further education and employment after graduation, often leading to confusion and uncertainty. Either they rashly apply to schools or arbitrarily take up employment without carefully considering whether it suits their individual character, academic abilities, and interests. As a result, they often encounter obstacles shortly after starting, leading to mid-course changes and fickleness. This has a significant impact on educational effectiveness, individuals, and social livelihoods. The underlying reasons are that schools have not conducted thorough investigations into the students' personalities, provided ample knowledge of various occupations, and have not fully engaged with families to implement career guidance while students are studying at school. Furthermore, there are no regulations for implementing guidance at the educational administrative level, making supervision and oversight difficult. The Ministry has now specifically formulated outlines for the implementation of guidance on further education and career paths by educational administrative agencies and primary and secondary schools in all provinces and cities, which are attached to the order. The steps for promotion, implementation methods, etc., have been separately drafted. The departments and bureaus should promptly formulate detailed implementation measures in accordance with Article 4 of these outlines and submit them for approval and then forward them to their subordinates for compliance. This order is issued.</p>

(11) The provinces and cities should, at the end of each semester, determine the distribution of the number of primary and secondary schools to be established thereafter based on the estimates of further education and employment of graduates from primary and secondary schools throughout the province.

<p>it is difficult, so enrollment will be temporarily suspended for one year. Vice Minister has expressed the same view. After repeated explanations by me, Minister Wang said that the suspension of new student enrollment at the College of Commerce is only a temporary suspension of one year and is absolutely different from the discontinuation of the constitution. The purpose is to reorganize the existing classes, save funds, and strive to enrich the content. Enrollment will still be conducted next year. (2) After I explained the issue of high school students and first-year transfer students at the College of Commerce last year in detail, Minister Wang promised that the Peking University President's Office could submit the reasons and request the Ministry of Education to approve the filing. (3) Regarding the Peking University issue, the Ministry of Education has issued an order to Peking, which is the same as the original Ministry of Education order in today's (4th) newspapers. This time, the Ministry of Education summoned the deans of various colleges to Nanjing. After the deans of various colleges obeyed the order and went south to Nanjing, they discussed the actual situation of their respective colleges with the Ministry of Education without any formal meetings. I have completed my mission and took a train back north and arrived in Peking today.</p>
<h3>Wu Xiangfeng Speaks</h3>
<p>College of Medicine Dean Wu Xiangfeng has also returned to Peking. According to the interview with reporters: I went to Hankou last month and stayed in Hankou for five days. When I arrived in Nanjing, the Ministry of Education's order to rectify Peking University had already been issued. Because the Ministry order had nothing to do with the College of Medicine, I did not participate in the discussions. I had other matters to contact the Ministry of Health. The Ministry of Health was very supportive of the College of Medicine's establishment of a health education laboratory. As for the solution to the Peking University issue, it is the same as what was reported in today's (4th) newspapers. Deans Zuo Baiyan, Gu, and the Director Zong contacted the Ministry of Education separately. I do not know the details of the content.</p>

<h3>Students Who Fail Supplementary Examinations Will Not Be Promoted to Middle School</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education instructed the Municipal Education Bureau to notify the middle schools in the city that the Education Bureau has decided to handle the examinations for a portion of the students who have completed the entrance examination. Those who request supplementary examinations for subjects not taken, either by the school principal, student's parents, or the student himself, will be allowed to continue the examination. Students who could not attend the entrance examination at other schools due to special circumstances or who failed one or two subjects will be allowed to take the examination on the day the re-examination is held (currently scheduled for the 13th, 14th, and 15th of this month) to participate in the supplementary examination. High school students who did not participate in the graduation entrance examination or failed the graduation entrance examination will not be admitted to various colleges or universities in accordance with the law. As for those who participated in the middle school entrance examination but did not complete it, and the subjects already taken have passed, if they cannot take the supplementary examination due to special circumstances and apply to universities first, they should still take the supplementary examination for the subjects not completed. Only after all subjects have been taken and passed can they obtain the qualification for graduation and further education. The above measures were approved by the Ministry of Education's Order No. 6558 yesterday, and the Ministry issued a circular to colleges and universities in the city, stating that graduating high school students who have not passed the entrance examination are not allowed to register for admission to various public and private universities, colleges, and specialized schools. A portion of the students in this city who have not completed the entrance examination, but have passed the subjects already taken, are allowed to apply for admission first with a certificate issued by the Municipal Education Bureau. However, after admission, they must still request a supplementary examination from the bureau. Only if they pass the supplementary examination for each subject will they be allowed to attend classes. If they fail, their admission will be revoked. The Education Bureau immediately notified the schools after receiving the order.</p>
<h3>Elementary School Supplementary Examinations Begin Today</h3>

It is reported that the examination admission tickets should be uniformly exchanged for test paper admission tickets.

<h3>Middle School Entrance Examination Results to be Announced the Day After Tomorrow</h3>

The dates for the re-examinations and supplementary examinations were originally scheduled for July 10th, 11th, and 12th. It is now feared that students from other cities who need to take the re-examinations and supplementary examinations will not be able to arrive in Shanghai on time. Therefore, the re-examinations and supplementary examinations have been postponed to July 13th, 14th, and 15th. The examination locations and subject times will be announced separately.

<h3>Chengzhong School Board States the Process of Compensating Dismissed Teachers' Salaries</h3>
<p>A letter from the Shanghai Private Chengzhong Middle School Board of Directors states: Regarding the news report in your newspaper yesterday, "Chengzhong School Compensates Dismissed Teachers' Salaries," we are writing to explain the situation. The employment and dismissal of teachers at our school have always been the authority of the school's principal and director of academic affairs. The Board of Directors usually does not interfere. When the former principal, Ge, and others submitted their resignations in June of the 20th year of the Republic, they suddenly hired all the teachers for the next semester. Later, Principal Li took over. Because the date of the employment contracts was August 1st of the 20th year of the Republic, Principal Ge had already resigned and Director Xiang had also left the school, they were considered invalid, and a small number of teachers were not rehired. Afterwards, the teachers who were not rehired filed a complaint with our Board, which was instructed by the Education Bureau that it was "not a dismissal" and ordered to compensate for six months' salary, thus starting the dispute. After the dispute arose, our Board considered the matter repeatedly and believed that the employment contracts themselves were questionable, and that the teachers who were not rehired had mostly gone to the Xinlu Normal School with the former Principal Ge, and therefore there was no loss. It was not appropriate to demand "compensation." What our Board manages is public funds. We have never met the teachers and have no grievances against them, so we would certainly not deliberately make things difficult for them, but we could not use "public funds" to do "personal favors." If the compensation demand was justified, we would handle it according to law. Afterwards, our Board submitted a request to the Education Bureau for an explanation of the reason for compensating two months' salary. The Education Bureau replied on August 18th of the 21st year of the Republic that the written certificate of the former Principal Ge proved that although the date of the employment contracts was August 1st of the 20th year of the Republic, they were actually issued in late June. Before this, the teachers had already filed a lawsuit in court. Moreover, the result of the first lawsuit in the Special District Court was that the plaintiff teachers lost the case. Although the Supreme Court has now ruled that our Board should compensate, legal views differ on this fact, which proves this point. Now that the Supreme Court has ruled, our Board, having clearly stated the reasons for the dispute, will naturally comply. Since the case has been concluded, this dispute has also ended. We are writing this letter to inform you of the situation and hope that you will publish the original letter. Sincerely, the Chengzhong Middle School Board of Directors to the editor of the Shen Bao Education News.</p>

<h3>From "Being Scared and Apprehensive" to the Lack of Unified Language</h3>
<p>— Zhanlu</p>
<p>Northeast heroes Wang Delin and Kong Xianrong returned after resisting Japan for a long time, staying in Hong Kong. All circles welcomed Generals Wang and Kong, and newspapers repeatedly recorded their experiences resisting Japan. Chen Youren, the former Minister of Foreign Affairs and current Southwest Political Commissar, residing at the Peninsula Hotel, was also eager to meet Generals Wang and Kong. The humorous commentator believed that Generals Wang and Kong had excellent achievements in resisting Japan, but the combination of their surnames inevitably carried a sense of "apprehension." Chen Youren's meeting with General Wang became "being scared," and meeting with General Kong became "being apprehensive." Remembering that Daoist priests often use the phrase "being scared and apprehensive" in their prayers, wasn't this a foreshadowing of the meeting between Chen, Wang, and Chen, Kong?</p>
<p>The "being scared" meeting already took place last week, at Chen's residence in the Peninsula Hotel. Chen first called Wang Delin, inviting him to the Peninsula Hotel for a chat. Wang gladly accepted and went to meet Chen. However, upon meeting, a language barrier arose, so they could only meet but not converse. Chen couldn't speak Mandarin, and Wang's Mandarin wasn't very accurate. Even written communication was difficult, as Wang didn't know Chinese or foreign characters. Chen, although educated, read foreign books and knew foreign characters, so he couldn't communicate with Wang either. Later, they managed to find a Western-dressed friend who understood both Mandarin and English to act as a translator, and they were able to talk for an hour. The content of the conversation was kept secret by the newspaper, and I don't want to speculate. However, what struck me was that two important Chinese figures needed a translator to talk, which is probably not a good sign. If the meeting between Chen and Wang was like this, the meeting between Chen and Kong would certainly not be exempt from this language barrier. Alas! The lack of unified language is simply a situation of "being scared and apprehensive."</p>
<p>It's already quite alarming that two Chinese people need a Chinese translator to talk; it would be even more alarming if two Chinese people needed a foreign translator to talk. If Chinese language remains so fragmented, in the future we may need to ask foreigners to translate for fellow countrymen. The future is fraught with hidden dangers, too terrible to contemplate. I can only hum Wen Tianxiang's "Discussing apprehension on the terrifying shoals," as the conclusion to my "being scared and apprehensive" essay.</p>
<h3>A Different Scene</h3>
<p>— Linghua</p>
<p>Leather robes are constantly being brought in and out of pawnshops, exchanged for cotton robes, then lined robes, then unlined long gowns. Dogs are dragging their tongues out all day to cool off. So, summer has arrived.</p>
<p>In the countryside, frogs croak incessantly in the rice paddies, gray cicadas chirp endlessly on the branches, one mosquito buzzes, two flies hum. It's all quite interesting. But in Shanghai, it's a different scene.</p>
<p>When the hot weather comes, the benches in the parks are so packed with corpses that they can hardly breathe. Not to mention the flower-filled areas, even the rarely-visited lawns of the racecourse are visited by couples.</p>
<p>Swimming pools are, of course, a summer resort for modern men and women. Even in Suzhou, there are many who learn to swim and, incidentally, wash away their blemishes. What's more, the stray children who spend all year round greeting passersby on the bridges, their posture of jumping into the water from the bridge railings, is very worth appreciating.</p>
<p>In local restaurants and Wuxi noodle shops, the managers are all bare-chested, squeezing into the crowds. This is keeping with the ancient style, unlike the big hotels and cafes, which are always westernized. In purely Chinese residential areas, not only are the food shops like this, but the staff in the dried goods stores, northern goods stores, and so on, are all showing off their curves for artists to admire.</p>
<p>In the evening, the sidewalks on both sides of the roads are filled with people sleeping head-to-head, foot-to-foot, head-to-foot, and foot-to-head, avoiding the heat and the bedbugs. Although there are often those who are run over and killed by cars, those who have not been run over are still unwilling to sacrifice this right, because the municipal authorities have not yet thought of issuing permits for sleeping outdoors.</p>
<p>First-class figures all leave Shanghai to escape the heat. So second-class figures move the office clock forward an hour. It is said that in hot weather, getting up early in the morning and finishing an hour earlier is beneficial. So, finishing work at four o'clock, turning on the electric fan, listening to the radio, eating watermelon, and drinking soda, isn't that great?</p>
<p>But news of rickshaw pullers and dockworkers suffering from heatstroke and epidemics is published on the pages of the newspapers every day.</p>
<h3>Cucumber Song</h3>
<p>— Zhenqing</p>
<p>I don't know where this song originated. Children in the fields can all sing it. It depicts a kind of "beautiful," "simple," "hardworking," and "content" rural girl, which, compared to the urban girls who wear heavy makeup and compete for "modernity," are as different as heaven and earth. Although the lyrics are rustic, they are truly capable of influencing the world. Therefore, I recorded them.</p>
<p>Dig the soil, plant cucumbers, the girl who plants cucumbers is as beautiful as a flower. Separating ten slender fingers, a handful of mud and a handful of sand.</p>
<p>Carry water, water the cucumbers, the girl who waters cucumbers is as beautiful as a flower. Help brothers and sisters-in-law transplant seedlings, sun shines on her back, wearing a hat to cover.</p>
<p>Vines cover the ground, pick cucumbers, the girl who picks cucumbers is as beautiful as a flower. No one cares for her veined arms and white feet, morning and evening she treads the waterwheel.</p>
<p>After the busy farming season, eat cucumbers, the girl who eats cucumbers is as beautiful as a flower. She must rush to make a living every day, sitting at the loom during the day and spinning yarn at night.</p>
<h3>Dandy of Lotus</h3>
<p>— Shen Min</p>
<p>Shanghai, known as the ten-mile foreign concession, a prosperous city, is a gathering place for dandies. Among the dandies, there are also names such as "dandy of lotus" and "dandy of osmanthus." A dandy is a dandy, so why add a very fragrant title? That is truly a new beginning! It is said that this dandy of lotus is born in response to the season and can be regarded as a modern figure of the season. But once the summer season passes, those dandies of lotus transform into dandies of osmanthus.</p>
<p>The state of a dandy of lotus is the largest and most beautiful kind of flower. You only need to walk to the lotus pond, beside the winding bridge, stop and stand for a moment, gaze and look around, those white and pink lotus girls, one by one nodding and smiling at you, swaying gracefully, fresh wind comes together, fragrance overflowing, and there is quite a bit of poetry.</p>
<p>There are also some very sufficient reasons and figurative meanings to prove that the young master is likened to the lotus flower. The straw hat worn by the young master is similar to the open lotus flower. The lotus-green silk gauze gown worn by the young master is no different from the swaying lotus leaves when compared. The walking stick in his hand is like the lotus stalk. The snow-white silk stockings and white canvas shoes worn on his feet are like fat, tender lotus roots. A burst of the fragrance of Parisian perfume is stronger than the fragrance of the lotus flower. However, once summer passes, the straw hat is broken and out of fashion. To buy a felt hat, one is embarrassed by the lack of money. One can only be a bald dandy, just like the lotus flower whose petals have fallen, leaving only a lotus seed pod. The lotus-green gown has also lost its timeliness. One must buy a lined gown, but the Yuan coin declares detachment. It is precisely "it is cold, the clothes are thin," and the dandy can only stand in the corner. It can also be said that "it is cold, the clothes are thin," like the wind blowing the lotus leaves and falling.</p>
<p>In the season of "loquat yellow, dandy hidden," many dandies of lotus were found. When summer comes, one only needs to put on a beautiful long gown, and how much does it cost? One can get a very ready-made title of dandy of lotus. It is really easy, and anyone can show off their style, whether Zhang San or Li Si. Unlike the dandies in winter, one cannot obtain the qualification of a dandy without double-layered fox fur and a thick woolen coat.</p>
<h3>Northeast Four Company Commanders</h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 10</p>
<p>Hearing her words, Fang Xin sealed his Marquis's wish as渺</p>
<p>Seeing the song, he showed envy, reporting the state's leisure</p>
<p>He was thinking like this, and kept looking up at the box. Huang Manying saw his situation and gently touched his arm. Guizhi turned his head, and Manying whispered: Can't you see? This wealthy lady, half a year ago, was just like me, a poor student. Later, in one place, this Brigade Commander Li saw her and took her to be his new wife. Guizhi said: Why call her a new wife? Manying said: Think about it, in this age, people emphasize equal rights between men and women. Which female student who knows a few words is willing to be someone's concubine? But now, the better men have almost all been snatched away in advance. Although it is not difficult to snatch a man from someone else's hands, it is not easy to kick that person out. The only way is to run both ends, to form families separately. Except for sharing a husband, no one cares about anything else. Of course, concubine is not allowed to be called. The wife is too… the original person does not agree, so since the revolution, a term has emerged, called the new wife. Guizhi said: Then it's actually a concubine. Manying said: No, the former concubine could not sit and walk side by side with the master, but today's new wife can do everything like the original wife, and can be in charge of everything. Especially in social situations, it is entirely the new wife's domain. Guizhi nodded and said: Oh, so that's how it is. If the master takes a new wife after taking a new wife, would that be called a new new wife? Manying smiled: I haven't heard of that before. Jiang said with a smile: Quiet down, running to the theater to chat. Although Guizhi was not convenient to speak further, he looked at the stage and was bound to look at the box. In his heart, he was thinking that many women who married military men have become unbelievably wealthy. He had always heard it, but today he saw it with his own eyes, and these words are indeed correct. (121)</p>

<p>Rambling Talk</p>
<h3>Summer in Suzhou</h3>
<p>— Zhu Wei</p>
<p>The sun scorches with intense heat, the air heavy with humidity; the dreaded summer has clearly arrived upon the earth. However, the war clouds over North China have dissipated, and peace has long returned to the banks of the Qinhuai River. Everything in our country seems to have returned to a state of prosperity, and Suzhou, like a paradise on earth, is brimming with vitality, especially during the fleeting moment of dusk in summer.</p>
<p>Parks and Romantic Traces Suzhou has parks, though they may lack elaborate designs. I remember Zhao Songquan of Yunnan once wrote a poem about parks: "A glance is all it takes as the carriage passes the park." However, in summertime, the spacious environment and gentle breeze make it comparable to the Gujiazhai Garden (i.e., the French Park) in Shanghai. Besides the East Tea House and West Pavilion, selling cool tea under makeshift shades, there are also shops like Natural Farm, Sanmin, and Huayu selling cold treats. With an icy drink in hand and a refreshing breeze on one's face, the park is indeed a great place to escape the heat. As evening approaches, the park fills with visitors of all ages and appearances, from old to young, rustic to fashionable. Modern youngsters, especially those young men in shirts and barefooted girls, flutter around the park in pairs, providing the tabloid newspapers with plenty of romantic stories under the dim lights.</p>
<p>Gold Quarters and Orioles The ban on prostitution, though a mere facade, has certainly dimmed the splendor of the brothels in Suzhou. Only those special figures with badges dare to discuss matters with singing girls in the decorated chambers of private celebrations. Others would not openly patronize them. Fortunately, the ban on prostitution will be lifted starting in July. From then on, the golden corners of the city will once again be filled with orioles and swallows; the brothels and painted towers will be lined with beautiful women, and the streets will resound with music and laughter. The dashing young men and wealthy merchants can spend lavishly, and ordinary merchants can benefit from the residual effects, restoring the sluggish market.</p>
<p>Seasonal Foods Besides fruits, the seasonal foods of summer naturally include cold dishes. European-style ice cream, fresh orange juice, and shaved ice have all become common drinks and foods for modern people. Suzhou also has several special cold dishes, such as white broad bean cake topped with green peppermint candy, pleasing to the eye and sweet and delicious to the taste. Mung bean soup is also known for its cooling properties. This year, Xin Yuan Zhai's sour plum soup from Beijing is also being sold in Suzhou. Among the dishes, two delicacies stand out: steamed pork with fresh lotus leaves, fragrant and rich; and watermelon chicken, fresh, tender, and delicious, a unique treat for connoisseurs.</p>
<p>Crowded Gatherings Due to the economic downturn, businesses are seeking new avenues, especially artists who rely on writing and painting for a living. Restricted by set prices, they cannot offer huge discounts, so exhibitions of calligraphy and painting have emerged as a timely solution. This year, the Suzhou exhibition includes local painters like Zhao Suying from Xiling, Yue Zhongyi from Jiaxing, and Qian Yunhe from Wuxing. More are expected to come. However, Suzhou is, after all, a land of culture and learning. While there is no lack of fine works in the exhibitions, only a few people appreciate art. As a result, most artists arrive with enthusiasm but leave disappointed, barely able to cover their expenses.</p>
<p>Summer Hygiene While the district offices and public security bureaus are responsible for summer hygiene in Suzhou, they mainly focus on cleaning the busy streets. Narrow alleys are often littered with melon peels and swarming with flies, and the small rivers emit a constant foul odor. Therefore, some suggest that, in addition to adding street cleaners, the district offices should also hire river cleaners to clean the waterways, which would greatly improve hygiene.</p>

<h3>The Women's Circle and National Goods Promotion</h3>
<p>— Yang An</p>
<p>Recently, the China National Goods Production and Sales Cooperation Association, seeking to enhance national goods promotion, has frequently consulted with women's circles. The discussions have yielded many valuable insights, which are essential knowledge for the national goods industry.</p>
<p>Mrs. Song Xingcun said, "Excellent national goods often suffer from impure refining, unattractive packaging, incomplete instructions, and inadequate usage guidance. This leads to customer dissatisfaction and inability to fully utilize the products, thereby reducing sales. In particular, careless sales practices can inadvertently lose many good customers. According to a survey by an American magazine, 94 percent of customer attrition is due to unsatisfactory service from salespeople. This highlights the importance of effective promotion."</p>
<p>Mrs. Yu Yingjie said, "During my studies abroad, I was deeply impressed by the American business community's meticulous attention to consumer psychology. They cater to and entice consumers in every possible way. Their products are designed to be irresistible. For example, American department stores not only have an exhaustive selection of goods but also provide comprehensive auxiliary facilities. In the writing room, you can write letters. The company even has a post office where you can quickly and conveniently mail your purchases. This makes consumers extremely satisfied, to the point that they don't want to leave. Factories are constantly innovating new products and employing various methods to secure customer trust, fostering strong faith in their products and encouraging their adoption. China's national goods industry is still in its infancy, and it's impossible to suddenly catch up with Europe and America. However, gradual improvement is promising. I have seen many national goods in Chinese national goods stores that are already superior to imported products."</p>
<p>The words of these two ladies represent the general opinion of the women's circle. They are insightful and reasonable, offering a valuable compass for the national goods industry to improve production and sales methods.</p>
<h3>Summer Goods and Students</h3>
<p>— Shi Dian</p>
<p>With the arrival of scorching summer, schools are successively beginning summer vacation. Young students who have traveled far from home to study in the city are preparing to return home for the summer break.</p>
<p>Before returning home, male and female students will purchase some summer seasonal goods, to avoid various inconveniences after returning to the hinterland. These items have a significant impact on the people of their hometowns, because the backwardness of the inland people is self-evident. They always regard the clothes and supplies of people from the outside, especially from Shanghai, as new and fashionable, which leads them to imitate each other and purchase them. As for inland female students and fashionable women, they are more fond of imitating the Shanghai female students' clothing. The clothing and supplies of the male and female students returning from Shanghai will often lead them to purchase foreign goods if they are foreign goods. If they are national goods, they can also use national goods without expecting it. Therefore, the summer supplies brought by the male and female students returning from Shanghai from vacation have a great influence on the inland people.</p>
<p>Students have always been very patriotic. In the past great patriotic movements, such as the May Fourth Movement and the May Thirtieth Movement, their enthusiasm for advocating national goods is worthy of admiration by people from society. However, there are a part of students who do not have a deep understanding of national goods; they often wear beautiful western clothes and foreign leather shoes, and stand on the stage shouting to promote national goods.</p>
<p>In this period of national crisis in which every compatriot is burdened with dangers, summer has already arrived. When students go home to purchase summer supplies, they should understand that summer supplies have a very important relationship with you. In order to implement your sincere patriotism, you should work hard to use national goods.</p>
<h3>The National Goods Movement and Our Awareness</h3>
<p>— Guo Yinsheng</p>
<p>In this sluggish economy, with backward production and social economy, people have long felt that we must promote national goods to save the current difficulties. However, for the reason of "accumulated and difficult to reverse", a great movement, the national goods movement, is needed to correct it.</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, I accidentally saw a fragment of a record in a newspaper, saying that "university students and bank employees are the most active promoters of imported goods". As a university student, I felt very ashamed after reading this passage. Indeed, this is an undeniable fact. No matter how loudly you shout, cold spears and hot sarcastic words, you can't wake up our university students, who are known as the "knowledge class." However, of course, not everyone is like this, and it is still worrying.</p>
<p>As far as our clothing is concerned, it seems that everyone must have a suit to show that they are a university student. However, in this realistic society that "only recognizes clothes and not people," there is indeed a "have to" helplessness (?). So I don't object to wearing suits, but why not use national goods as raw materials? And why do you often have to go to foreign stores to make them? This is really a doubtful capital that you can't think of the rest of it.</p>
<p>As for other life, not everyone is Europeanized. But I always hope that our university students can use domestic products to replace imported goods, so it is not necessary to use imported goods.</p>
<p>Originally, the "thrift movement" and the "national goods movement" are two facts and two meanings. "Thrift" is to absolutely eliminate bad luxury to save the economy. "Promoting national goods" is to prevent the outflow of rights and interests and develop the national economy. However, there is also a related relationship between them.</p>
<p>It is better for our young people to develop the virtue of "thrift". Even if not, luxury must have a considerable limit, and it is especially suitable to be active within the scope of national goods. We must know that from the perspective of the majority, it is indeed difficult to be a university student, so how should we care for our families? How do we make our lives conform to the actual environment? And how to take into account the seriousness of people's livelihood problems?</p>
<p>The theory of "promoting national goods" is also "very familiar" to our university students, but I will say one last thing, "I hope everyone will wake up and do it practically according to the theory!"</p>
<p>"Chinese people should use Chinese goods"</p>
<p>"The knowledge class must set an example"</p>
<h3>Summer Practical Cotton Fabrics</h3>
<p>— Nian</p>
<p>Towel Blanket In such hot weather, it is easiest to catch a cold at night. For prevention, a light and soft towel blanket must be set up; although there are few foreign goods of this kind, there are often products of workmanship and materials being cut back in domestic goods sales, so those who love to use domestic goods should buy directly from the factory selling them.</p>
<p>Palm Canopy Cover Sleeping is an indispensable rest in life. It is most painful to be disturbed by bed bugs and unable to sleep. In addition to using bed bug leaf water, the palm canopy cover is indispensable.</p>
<p>Bath Set Foreigners bathe daily all year round. Although we cannot catch up, we must also wash it every day in these three hot months to remove sweat and dirt and to prevent disease. Bathing must use bath equipment, such as bath gloves, back rubbing belts, large towels, etc., to get friction all over the body to make it red.</p>
<p>Due to the limited space, I will not say more. I hope that each family will prepare and fulfill it, and diseases may be reduced by one or two.</p>
<h3>A Word in Four Characters</h3>
<p>— Jin Yixi</p>
<p>I am a member of the rural education comrades. I have the responsibility to guide farmers. I have gathered more than a dozen farmer friends to talk at the school. Most of them think that "the quality of national goods is not as exquisite as foreign goods; and the value is higher than foreign goods." Therefore, national goods have been hit in the faith of farmer friends, which is very dangerous. Although many national goods are progressing, they still need to be improved as soon as possible to achieve the advocacy of national goods. Especially cloth, it is necessary to go deep into the countryside. Therefore, I will send a word in four characters to tell all the gentlemen of the national goods industry and commerce. The four characters are:</p>
<p>"Work hard to improve,</p>
<p>Excellent products everyone evaluates,</p>
<p>Cheap and good goods everyone wants,</p>
<p>National goods production and sales are naturally effective".</p>
<p>I don't know what the gentlemen of industry and commerce think?</p>
<h3>The Call of the National Goods Year</h3>
<p>— Xu Nangong</p>
<p>The fleeting time is about to pass half of the National Goods Year. The period of a few months is indeed very short, but what kind of achievements have the people of the country made in their understanding of national goods? It is really heartbreaking to say! I dare to say boldly that except for the publicity in the newspapers and the cheering of a part of the people of the country, there is no great progress in the substance of national goods. We can prove this fact by the number of foreign goods imported every month. What is especially obvious is that the general fashion men and women and young students who can be seen everywhere in the streets and alleys still wear brand-new foreign clothes, swaggering through the market. Many stores still display various foreign goods. Under this situation, national goods are indeed rarely expanded.</p>
<p>Perhaps this is our inferiority. Every time a foreign insult is attacked and bullied and slaughtered by imperialists, there is always a passionate patriotic movement, and this movement is also a form of action, shouting slogans, posting slogans, issuing declarations, and making a burst of roars and jumps, but after a period of time, the heat also decreases with the days, and as for the smoke disappears, there is actually no effect, and it does not hurt the invaders at all. It is not my nitpicking. The iron-like facts in the past are lying in front of our eyes. Several times to resist inferior goods and to end economic relations with Japan, at first, they were happy and angry and indignant, and strictly enforced. Then they were exhausted and depressed, because the traitors took advantage of them and the people of the country did not have a lasting heart. As a result, the harvest of resistance instead encouraged the rampantness of inferior goods.</p>
<p>Failure is the mother of success, this is an ancient motto of great truth, the past experience tells us, the previous failure is tied to the lack of national goods, there is no alternative for domestic products, so now we must change our strategy to engage in the cultivation of domestic products, use the energy of shouting slogans and posting slogans to create domestic products, only use national goods, and love national goods as the standard of each country, and it is also the motto of each country. We want to create a self-sufficient country, because this is the only way to get on the road to prosperity, otherwise it is a dead end.</p>
<p>Writing here, I can't help but shout loudly, the knowledge classes who have the leading group of the public and the backbone of the society! Don't just indulge in the red light and green wine, and be obsessed with the jazz singing, and sing aloud about entertainment to save the country. Especially doing this kind of labor-consuming and money-consuming thing is not as practical as wearing a national goods dress.</p>

<h3>Prelude to the Opening of the Qingdao National Goods Exhibition</h3>
<p>— Xuan Wan</p>
<p>A major program in the National Goods Year, our major commercial port in North China, and at the same time, a well-known dumping area for enemy goods丨Qingdao, under the high-hanging umbrella, is flying flags, a grand national goods exhibition will be opened here solemnly (July 10). In advance, major national goods manufacturers in Shanghai actively participated, collected completely, and became a grand view. The giants of the national goods industry, Pan Yangyao, Fang Jiange, Fang Yixian, and Ren Shigang also went there in person to guide them. Each brought exquisite national goods, shouldered a major mission, did not resign from Yan Shu, and traveled thousands of miles to work hard to create a glorious page in the history of national goods together, which is also very worthy of our admiration. However, the situation of this exhibition is different and special, generally, there should be the following points to pay attention to, as the principle of our brave ride the waves丨great event:</p>
<p>(1) Propaganda that should be had to the outside world. Qingdao is a region where enemy goods are dumped. Generally, people are ignorant of the psychology of being cheap, and instead abandon their own national goods. This time, we bravely went to make an effort to publicize, so that they can correct their previous bad habits and thoroughly realize their patriotism in the future. Our own goods must be especially cheap, and we must not hesitate to sacrifice to promote the true meaning of the exhibition as a prerequisite.</p>
<p>(1) Internal placement that should be had. It seems that most of our previous exhibitions have always been too hasty, but this time it is not the case. Qingdao is a famous summer resort with a cool climate. At this time, there are clouds of dignitaries and weaving tourists, and it is heard that the North China Games will also be opened there. A grand event can be expected. We are also trying our best to refine the layout. Trying to think about this great exhibition, how complex the guests are, and we must make everyone satisfied and praise them in unison, so that guests can feel at home, so that we can achieve the purpose of this trip.</p>
<p>There is also one point, which is the most important and the most complicated thing, that is, our previous exhibitions often ended with the end, in other words, after the closing of an exhibition, we no longer make continuous efforts in that place. In fact, this is wrong. Now, when the Qingdao National Goods Exhibition is closed, we should urgently establish a mutual agreement with local vendors or local people's organizations. You can continue to order directly from Shanghai's national goods manufacturers. Recently, I heard that Shanghai and Qingdao's national goods leaders will jointly establish the "Qingdao National Goods Company". That is naturally the best.</p>
<h3>A Pleasing Scene</h3>
<p>— Ai Yu</p>
<p>I often hear this sigh: "The most loyal customers of foreign goods must be modern girls!" Indeed, this is an undeniable fact. As long as you take some time to stand in front of a foreign goods store, you can confirm that this sentence is not false. But, is this their丨modern girls丨's original intention? I dare say it's definitely not, no one has a confidant to enlighten them. If you don't believe me, please see the following scene:</p>
<p>X X X X</p>
<p>Scene A old-fashioned family</p>
<p>Characters Old and dragon-bellied old woman丨Mother</p>
<p>Fashionable girl Lizhu! girl</p>

<p>Mother Ah! How much money?</p>
<p>Female But it's only a little over five yuan.</p>
<p>Mother Alas! Your tone is really big, five or six more or more Less is still but; hey!</p>
<p>Female Otherwise, it would be eight or nine yuan, wouldn't it be cheaper three Yuan?</p>
<p>Mother (pointing to the clothes made of the cloth of this factory on her own body Body, looking at her daughter) Is it cheap? My Body's clothes and pants, with more than five yuan, can do Do two or three sets! Cheap and strong, why don't you You like it?</p>
<p>Female You old people can wear it well, we can't really wear it Wear it out.</p>
<p>Mother (slightly angry) Can't wear it out? I wasn't as neat as I am now, how come your parents also love me? You always shout about new characters and old characters at every turn. I really don't understand. What are you shouting about promoting National goods, using National goods, but saving money and putting in life to send it out. We old corruption can't stand it. Have you forgotten the horror of airplanes and cannons?</p>
<p>Female (gradually waking up, finally tears filled her eyes) Mom Mom! I woke up! I woke up! My heart and my Guilt, only Mom knows, I will never buy foreign Goods again.</p>
<p>Mother (smiling) Good! My child! Be sure to firmly Remember!</p>
<h3>China National Goods Company Today</h3>
<p>— Ding Xing</p>
<p>What is the most essential need of Chinese people? Clear-headed people, of course, all know that it is: "Using National goods", which has already become a common slogan. In this urgent need, China National Goods Company has emerged, However, it has only been a few months, but it has been imprinted in the minds of ordinary people. This is exactly an important moment.

<p>Regarding the "food" aspect!</p>
<p>The mountain treasures and seafood in the merchandise department cannot tell you the names of its products. To put it simply, it is that everyone likes to come and buy it. The Ning-style tea food is very authentic, and there are also heavy-pressed solid candles. Although it is a bit old, it does not lose its eastern style, so they are also determined to manufacture it to supply it. The food products from all over the country in the local specialty department are far from Yunnan, Sichuan, Guizhou, Beiping, Tianjin, and near Suzhou, Changzhou, Zhenjiang, Yangzhou, Hangzhou, Jiaxing, Huzhou, and Shaoxing, and have special fresh products, which are transported daily, The ham department carefully selected Shangjiang Xuefang, both color and taste are excellent, there are more kinds of candies and canned food in the two departments of delicacies, the fruit juice and mandarin orange juice are praised, the brandy and Heissge in the tobacco and alcohol department are very suitable for summer drinking, The famous mountains produced in the tea department, the seasonal fresh fruits in the fruit department, the ice and snow cold drinks and western-style refreshments in the diet department are all welcomed by everyone.</p>

<p>Under the precise organization that has been adopted, they are still striving for excellence, so the future prospects are even more unlimited!</p>
<h3>Summer Skincare and Fragrances</h3>
<p>— Xiao Ping</p>
<p>I often think: Summer can be considered a corrupting season, because everything is easily spoiled in summer, and even people exude a pungent sweat! Therefore, in this detestable summer, we must pay special attention to skin hygiene.</p>
<p>Daily bathing can remove sweat from the body. However, after bathing, the pores of the skin open, and being exposed to the wind can easily lead to colds and other illnesses. If you can apply "Wuzhou Refreshing Powder" produced by Wuzhou Pharmacy all over your body after bathing, it will not only make your skin healthy and delicate, but also emit a faint fragrance, making people happy! Also, "Wuzhou Flower Water" has a fragrant aroma and is economical in price. Daily spraying can resist foul odors, detoxify, and relieve itching. It is a famous domestic product that every household must have in the summer.</p>
<p>Modern factories, regardless of their size or capital, should consider the improvement of safety equipment as a determinant of their future development. Therefore, entrepreneurs with broad vision pay special attention to the safety of factory machinery. After all, accidents can easily occur in various parts of the factory if carelessness prevails. To avoid this, precautions must be taken next to motors and belts. The illustration on the right shows this type of safety device, where a wire mesh protects the surrounding areas of motors and belts. This prevents damage to the machinery from endangering the lives of workers. All domestic goods factories in our country should try to install such devices, as it is a way to maintain factory safety.</p>
<p>(Note: The Yangshupu Gongqin Iron Factory has hired a special technician to be responsible for the installation.)</p>

<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>My Thoughts on "Degraded People"</h3>
<p>— Ke</p>
<p>In the "Free Talk" section of June 29th, Mr. Tang discussed the degraded people of eastern Zhejiang. Based on the "Humble Discussions on Degraded People," he believed that they were subordinates of Song general Jiao Guanglie. Because they surrendered to the Jin dynasty, they were not accepted by the people of the time. During the reign of Emperor Taizu of Ming, their doors were marked with "Beggar Households." Since then, they have lived a life of sorrow and contempt.</p>
<p>I was born in Shaoxing. Degraded people were a common sight in my childhood. I also heard the same origin stories about how they became degraded people from your elders. But later, I became suspicious. I thought, Emperor Taizu of Ming would not dare to be presumptuous towards the Yuan dynasty, so he would certainly not interfere with the Song dynasty who surrendered to the Jin, which was a dynasty earlier; moreover, looking at their occupations, there are still obvious traces of "teaching workshops" or "musician households." Therefore, their ancestors might have been loyal ministers and righteous men who resisted the Hongwu and Yongle emperors of the early Ming dynasty. Furthermore, the descendants of good people may suffer, but the descendants of traitors may not necessarily become degraded people. To give a recent example, Yue Fei's descendants still guard Yue Wang's tomb in Hangzhou, living a very poor and miserable life, but what about the descendants of Qin Hui and Yan Song? ······</p>
<p>However, I don't want to rehash these old accounts now. I just want to say that the degraded people in Shaoxing are a kind of slaves who have been liberated, perhaps during the Yongzheng reign. So they already have other occupations, naturally lowly ones. The men collect old goods, sell chicken feathers, catch frogs, and perform in dramas; the women, during New Year's and festivals, go to the homes they consider their masters to offer congratulations and help with celebratory or mourning events. Here, they still retain traces of slavery, but they leave after the event and receive considerable rewards, which shows that they have been liberated.</p>
<p>Each family of degraded people has a fixed master's family to visit, and they cannot visit at will. When the mother-in-law dies, the daughter-in-law goes instead, passing it down to future generations like an inheritance. Only if they are extremely poor and sell the right to visit to someone else can they sever ties with the old master. If you tell them not to come for no reason, it is equivalent to giving them a major insult. I remember after the Republican Revolution, my mother said to a degraded woman, "From now on, we are all the same, you don't have to come anymore." Unexpectedly, she changed her expression and replied angrily, "What are you talking about? ···· We will continue to visit for thousands of generations!"</p>
<p>Just for a little reward, not only are they content to be slaves, but they must also become more extensive slaves, and even have to pay to buy the right to be slaves. This is something that free people other than degraded people cannot imagine.</p>
<h3>Random Notes on Reading</h3>
<p>— Xiao Xue</p>
<p>㈢ "Spring in the North," is a collection of prose written by Wang Tongzhao, describing his life in the Northeast for half a year before September 18th. Although the book unfolds some of the situation in the Northeast, it is superficial and limited in scope. To summarize my opinion, there are three points. First, the author did not fully develop the broad lives of the people in the Northeast. Second, the author saw some general shortcomings of Northeastern society, but could not see them in essence. Third, the author could not explain the relationship between Japanese imperialism and the Northeast from an economic point of view, but only exposed some of their brutal acts. In reality, this book is still just a book that is centered on the individual, explaining some of the people and things around him.</p>
<p>Among the twenty prose pieces, the most successful are the two chapters "Old Man" and "Poetry Talk." "Old Man" writes about a farmer. "Poetry Talk" writes about a school worker from a farming background. In the depiction of the two people, the revolutionary, straightforward, and strong character of the farmers in the Northeast is fully explained. "Old Man" more clearly narrates how Japan and old Russia directly and continuously persecuted the farmers. His wife died of cold after childbirth, along with her baby; his two older children were taken to transport bullets by old Russia during the Russo-Japanese War and died; his daughter was raped to death by several "foreign soldiers"; he himself was also injured because of this. However, he did not give in at all. He lived a life of "drilling into the mountains, running horses, digging ginseng, fighting, being a bandit, and killing for revenge" for twenty years. From these places, it is easy for us to think about why Japanese imperialism was helpless against the people's volunteer army and could not eliminate them after September 18th...</p>
<p>The author's point of view clearly shows a tendency towards anarchist humanitarianism, which can also be seen in the two articles "Old Man" and "Poetry Talk." In the myth in the article "In the Carriage of the Red Sun Flag," he more positively explains his own thoughts. He said: "Boundaries and territories are the self-made sins of human beings. I fundamentally believe that there is no need for such differences. I am not any...ist, and I have never known that I must unswervingly bow my head to any...ism. Because this is clearly a man-made boundary line; even from the perspective of academic literature and art, there are naturally factions and opinions, but that is just a convenient drawing for critics. Researchers and creators do not necessarily first create a very clear framework to put themselves in. Although the times can change people's feelings and thoughts, there is still a personal current in this, and the value of "transcending time and difference" lies in this... In short, the boundaries of human beings have harmed everything too much, and self-made sins are too many. When studying this book and this author, these confessions are very important materials that cannot be ignored.</p>
<p>㈣ Past poets have long had the angry saying "A scholar is useless." When "Society and Education" was first published, Ye Shaojun and others also had the feeling that knowledge was useless and continuously wrote many papers.</p>
<p>In "Spring in the North," Wang Tongzhao has the following confession:</p>
<p>Like us, we can't do anything. We rely on our mouths and pens to spend our days in society in vain, clamoring all day long, thinking about some subtle things, composing pictures, or reviewing and organizing, retelling some new and old books. Can these boring actions fulfill much of the human duty? Can it help our brothers? If we honestly recall, at least I feel sad and ashamed of the emptiness of literary men! In contrast, how can we compare to a road worker or a harvesting farmer? (Night Talk)</p>
<p>This can be said to be another "uselessness of knowledge theory," the sadness of a group of petty-bourgeois intellectuals in the dark era; in fact, if they can keep up with the times, how can knowledge be useless? Many great thinkers are good examples.</p>
<h3>Telling the Truth</h3>
<p>— Tang Tao</p>
<p>Mr. Zhou Zuoren, in the preface to his Zhitang Anthology, guarantees that what he says is the truth, which gives rise to the following thoughts.</p>
<p>This era is what political history calls the era of Decadence; everything is in a state of drowsy twilight. If literary men are not deaf, mute, and blind in this year, they can't help but say a few words about the status quo. However, as Mr. Lu Xun said, "There are few times when you scratch the itch, and many times when you touch the pain."</p>
<p>Therefore, the difficulty of speaking comes. Our China has always been known for its leniency, not to mention the Six Classics and Eight Virtues, which have been advocated. Isn't touching other people's pain points in speech contrary to the way of loyalty and forgiveness! Literary men who read the books of Confucius and Mencius should understand this, but they stubbornly insist on telling the truth, which has the suspicion of "knowingly committing the crime."</p>
<p>Moreover, the truth that literary men say is not very reliable. As the saying goes, "Get the truth from a child's mouth"; since they can wield a pen to write articles, it is known that they are no longer children. Moreover, it is said that the minds of literary men are more acute than ordinary people, and this excessive dual sensitivity often makes them mistake pig blood for human blood; they always regard revolutionary rioters as 安撫; and we diligent and caring, loving the Party and the country, should be valued, but instead we end up worthless. These literary men who tell the truth inevitably say lies in every sentence.</p>
<p>As for the literary men themselves, they often say a sentence, I say a sentence, and then start to fight, wrestling into a ball, rolling into a pile, and they will not hesitate to break their heads and bleed. To investigate the reason, it is nothing more than thinking that what they say is the truth, but others are fabricating lies in every sentence. By extension, the world is naturally full of troubles; so all wars and disasters are first called for by literary men. If from now on, literary men can really shut their mouths tightly and put down their pens, brushes, pencils, and fountain pens together, and no longer say truths that are similar to lies, so that those who come will be like entering a deserted place, then the river will be clear and the sea will be calm, the Party and the country will be prosperous, and the lifespan will be boundless!</p>
<h3>Talking about the Tender Township</h3>
<p>— He Ru</p>
<p>It is said that Emperor Cheng of Han obtained Zhao Feiyan and felt that her whole body was like cotton, irresistible, and called it the Tender Township. He also said: "I am old in this township and cannot follow Emperor Wu to seek the White Cloud Township again." When I was young, I read articles such as Records of Drunken Township, Records of Hungry Township, and Records of Sleepy Township, and I regretted that I had not seen Records of Tender Township. When I read the section of Jin Ping Mei about Zhuo Erjie returning to Yin, which wrote about Zhuo Erjie dreaming of Tender Township when she was in danger, although there were only a few words, it was also gratifying, which is called comforting the feelings of the township without also.</p>
<p>Zhuo Erjie was ill and dying, and her thoughts were in a trance. Ximen Qing went out of the gate, and she began to faint and shouted loudly, "Where is this place? Why am I here?" Yuenang Li Ruer heard Zhuo Erjie's madness and rushed to his room to wake him up and asked him what he saw. Zhuo Erjie said, "...飘一处, 据台金碧, 柳暗花明, 好鸟临风而歌, 作婉囀之欢声. 海棠, 飘柔丝以撩人, 顾曰温柔乡. 入其中, 但闻签管容 , 歌声裂帛." 月娘道:"歌些怎的?"卓二姐道:"只听得首座一人歌曰: 美色盐中緑, 美味鱼中毒. 可怜世上人, 尽堕销魂狱丨第二人歌曰, 莲炬融融春风温, 迷香洞中儘迷魂, 黄金费尽歌舞空, 十年一觉扬州梦."月娘道:"这也奇怪, 想是你神思恍惚, 就见了这些."</p>
<p>This so-called Tender Township, how very similar it is to today's so-called dancing hall! In the old feudal society, those who could truly enjoy the pleasures of the Tender Township ranged from monarchs like Emperor Cheng of Han to wealthy gentry like Ximen Qing, while the poor and suffering people were excluded. If there is a Tender Township in this world today, then who are the people who enjoy it?</p>

<h3>Ordinary Things (3)</h3>
<p>— Yongsun</p>
<p>One night during that winter we mentioned, after he had placed four or five bets on the long table covered in green呢, he suddenly noticed a pretty female customer, about twenty-two or three years old, greeting him. He responded in a machine-like manner. Then he looked at her for a while, thinking that her single-lidded, oval-shaped face did indeed look familiar, but he couldn't remember where they had met. The female customer probably understood what Yongsun meant and said straightforwardly:</p>
<p>"Third Master, it's been several years since I've seen you."</p>
<p>Her voice sounded so familiar to him that he instinctively replied:</p>
<p>"I really don't know how many years it's been!"</p>
<p>Two or three of the men and women at the same table secretly glanced at them, but after these few words, they all calmly placed their bets.</p>
<p>The next day, they met again at the same time and place. This time, Yongsun realized that the female customer was the younger sister of a 长三 prostitute he had known seven or eight years ago. Her former name was "Guan Lan Lao Wu," but now she had become a respectable woman and was said to be the wife of a rising young politician.</p>
<p>Later, he gradually understood Lao Wu's life. Her husband, Shou Zichun, had left the political world due to an incident similar to "lèse-majesté" and only held a nominal position in a semi-official bank. His income was certainly not as abundant as before, but Lao Wu herself still gambled every day. One day, she suddenly said to Yongsun:</p>
<p>"Zichun is a friend of your eldest nephew, Bo Tang! I should change my address now and call you Great Uncle."</p>
<p>Later, Lao Wu led Zichun to "Number 281" to meet Yongsun. From then on, Yongsun's list of acquaintances added Zichun, a person who was half-nephew and half-qingke. They met every day. Originally, although Yongsun was almost fifty years old, he was still a free spirit who rarely returned home. Therefore, the time he met with Zichun was far less frequent than the time he met with the qingke. It wasn't until the fighting in Zhabei began and the concession was under martial law that his entertainment activities were restricted and he had the leisure to come to Bo Tang's house every two or three days to chat for half a day...</p>
<p>Yongsun was deep in thought when suddenly a maid ran into the room, saying that the factory's workers wanted to talk to the owner. Immediately, the news was like a bomb falling in the courtyard, shocking everyone in the room! However, Bo Tang finally walked out calmly.</p>
<p>Everyone listened intently. Bo Tang said a few "okay" and "very good" into the phone, and their hearts gradually calmed down. Later, his footsteps almost simultaneously returned to the room with the sound of the four words "see you tomorrow" in his mouth. Yongsun dropped his opium pipe and asked:</p>
<p>"What's the matter?"</p>
<p>"The workers in the factory want to talk to me," Bo Tang said. "They have elected four representatives to meet with me tomorrow morning."</p>

<h3>New Lows in Financial Market are Constantly Emerging</h3>
<p>丨840 Yuan and 7 Jiao丨</p>
<p>丨Another Drop of 10 Yuan and 3 Jiao丨</p>
<p>The overall new low price trend in yesterday's gold market was relatively flat, mainly because the London big deals, both near and far, increased by 3 1/25. The exchange rate between the British and American currencies rose by another 6.75 points, and the market immediately retreated to within 50 yuan. Ruixing and Hengxing and others had supplies. Although there was a slight increase, it was difficult to maintain. Initially, after the opening, it was quite stable, but then due to a false rumor that HSBC's listed US exchange rate had shrunk, it rose once, but eventually retreated due to the banks' offerings. HSBC's official announcement revealed that the British exchange rate was flat, while the American exchange rate continued to increase by 1.25. Afterwards, it gradually weakened, and the process was quite mediocre. At noon, the price was even lower due to Datong's sales of US dollars for this month, but the noon closing was still able to pull up. It is found that there is no special change during this half day. Under the economic war, the future seems difficult to be optimistic. The lowest price reached 840 yuan and 7 jiao, another new low price. The clam price is increased by 135 yuan as usual. The half-day market situation is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The morning opening was 846 yuan and 8 jiao, a decrease of 6 yuan and 7 jiao compared to the previous closing. Items opened at 7 yuan. The initial exchange rate was tight for British and hard for American. The near-term selling price was British exchange rate 1 shilling 3 pence 1875, American exchange rate 28 yuan and 25. Hengxing and Fuyu took the lead in selling, and it rose to 9 yuan. However, afterwards, the banks all offered October US dollars at 75. Daxing, Yongda, Lianbang, Yuansheng, Yongzhengchang and others sold and retreated to 5 yuan. Yuanmao and Yongjin offered at a flat price. Tai Tao bought October US dollars at 1.25, and the situation of replenishing short positions was confusing. Hengxing and Zhengchang sold again, and it rose again to 9 yuan and 2 jiao. Dongya and McGallie offered October US dollars at 75. Fuyu, Fuchang, Yuansheng and Yongzaixian fell to 6 yuan. HSBC's listing was announced, the British exchange rate was flat and the American increased by 1.25. At this time, it was very peaceful. The banks were diligent in buying shillings, and it once rose to 7 yuan and 7 jiao. However, afterwards, colleagues wanted to sell October US dollars at 875 but failed. The HSBC would sell August half-yuan exchange rate to Shenkang and others at 5 yuan and within. The Central sold October US dollars to Mitsui at 9375. Yuanmao and Yonglai sold 420 bonds and easily lowered to 2 and a half yuan. Ruikang took the opportunity to replenish short positions and pulled up more than 2 yuan. Hengxing then came out again, and the situation still declined. Datong sold this month's US dollars to Citibank at 4375. Dadecheng, Lanchang, Yuyansheng, and Yong geng sold to within 2 yuan. The short positions were replenished, and the price once rose to 4 and a half yuan. Finally, Datong was still willing to offer 4375 for this month, but there were no buyers. People were panicked, and Fuyu, Futaiheng, Hengyu, Bingxing and others competed to sell and fell to 0.7 jiao. Yuanmao and Yongheng then bought, and they were still able to pull up. After that, Shanghai sold this month's US dollars at 4375, which was sold by Datong. People's hearts gradually stabilized, and Zhengchang vigorously purchased, and the noon closing was 843 yuan and 2 jiao. The item was sold at 3 and a half yuan. It was found that the highest price during the half-day was 849 yuan and 2 jiao, and the lowest was 840 yuan and 7 jiao, with a fluctuation of 8 yuan and a half. As a result, it fell by another 10 yuan and 3 jiao compared to the previous closing.</p>
<p>The listed price increased because HSBC's listed American exchange rate increased by 1.25, to 27 yuan and 75. The combined standard gold price was 864 yuan, 8 jiao and 6 fen, which was about 21 yuan less than the closing price, an increase of more than 6 yuan compared to the previous closing. The invoice price for this month was 853 yuan, and for August was 843 yuan. The morning replenishment was 853 yuan, and the starting price was increased by 135 yuan as usual. Tongfeng and Hengjin small money shops sold to the customer gang at an increase of 145 yuan as usual, and the entry and exit price was less than 200 taels. The swap was still quiet. For items, Shenkang posted 9 yuan and 4 jiao and 9 yuan and 6 jiao on the 17th, totaling about 385 bonds. For this month's bonds, there are still 2,597 bonds remaining.</p>
<p>In the market, suppliers are stronger, and people's hearts are still stable. In summary, Ruixing, Daxing, Yong, Yuansheng, Yong, Shenkang, Yuanchun, Fuyu, Futaiheng, Hengyu, Neixing, Yuanmao, Yongda, Dadecheng, Landaibang, Wanxing, Shunli and others were on the selling side, while Ruikang, Zhengchang, Hongli, Hengxing, Yuanxiang, Runchang, Yong and others were on the buying side. Landaibang and Wanxing sold 770 bonds, and Shunli sold 168 bonds. The Guang Gang and Hengxing bought about 400 bonds. The total amount of bonds in August was 22,540 bonds.</p>

Compared to the previous closing, the British was tight by 0.0625 and the American was hard by 3.125. Initially, it was still flat. Banks' buying and selling were divergent. When HSBC's listing was announced, the British exchange rate was flat and the American increased by 1.25, gradually becoming loose. Although the banks' doing business was common, the process seemed hard. The shilling's appetite was not small for the banks. Finally, Datong sold this month's American dollars, and there were no buyers for a while. Later, there was a slight purchase. The noon closing price for the near-term was British exchange rate 1 shilling 3 pence 25 and American exchange rate 28 yuan 4375 or 375. Compared to the previous closing, the British was flat and the American continued to be hard by half a yuan. The Buddhist currency was done at 555 and was bought in by the East. The banks invested and Datong and Zhongfu were on the selling side. In addition, all the banks' buying and selling were done by gold shops. The shills were slightly shilling, and the gold shops were on the selling side. Zhengjin strongly invested, and HSBC and McGallie's investment was tight.

<h3>City Call Loans Slightly Firmer, Collection and Settlement Turns Quiet</h3>
<p>Yesterday, although the Shanghai call loan market was slightly firmer than the previous day, with an interest rate of 8%, the same in the morning and afternoon, the actual market conditions were very sluggish. Therefore, the "toujia" (those who need funds) ultimately did not increase their demand, and all transactions were basically settled with "baihua" (clearing transactions). The volume of call loan transactions was also not as high as in the previous few days. Morning market transfers amounted to over 4.4 million taels of silver, new transactions to over 1.4 million taels of silver, foreign exchange collateral loan transactions to over 1.4 million taels of silver, banknote inflows and outflows (collection and issuance) to over 2.4 million taels of silver.

Furthermore, at the Shanghai Clearing House, the total exchange volume on the 5th was 17,760,089.79 silver dollars, including 14,791,064.70 silver dollars in silver currency and 2,817,909.09 silver dollars in remittances.</p>
<h3>Jiangnan Small Silver Drops Two Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Jiangnan small silver was priced at 845 yuan in both the morning and afternoon markets, a decrease of 2 yuan compared to the previous day. Only 9,000 "jiao" (a unit of silver) were traded in the morning market. Guangdong small silver was priced at 773.1 yuan in the morning market and 773.4 yuan in the afternoon market, a slight increase of 0.3 yuan compared to the previous day. Trading volume was 45,000 "jiao" in the morning market and 50,000 "jiao" in the afternoon market. Copper coins shortened by 500 "wen," to 317,000 "wen." Trading volume was over 36,400 strings of "wen."</p>
<h3>400,000 New Coins Shipped to Other Ports</h3>
<p>Since the official circulation of the new currency, inland areas and ports along the Yangtze River have been purchasing new currency from Shanghai and shipping old silver coins to Shanghai for exchange. Yesterday, areas such as Suzhou, Wuxi, Zhenjiang, Jiaxing, Changshu, Hangzhou, and areas along the Yangtze River such as Hankou, Jiangxi, Jiujiang, Wuhu, Datong, and areas further upriver such as Xiangsha, Yi, Yu, etc., were all supplied by Shanghai banks. The amount shipped in the previous two days was approximately one to two boxes per district for the Yangtze River ports, totaling 50,000 to 60,000 yuan, 20,000 to 30,000 yuan for areas further upriver. Yesterday, another 50,000 to 60,000 yuan were shipped to the Yangtze River, 100,000 yuan to areas further upriver, and over 200,000 yuan to various areas inland, totaling around 400,000 yuan. It is said that 200,000 yuan in old silver coins were shipped to Shanghai yesterday.</p>
<h3>Securities: Northern Merchants Purchase a Large Quantity of Public Bonds, Market Strength Maintained</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange remained stable as before and did not decline after settlement, as was often the case. In terms of market prices, the forward market was particularly strong. The trend of the 96 bonds remained very stable and showed no signs of decline. Trading was more active in the afternoon. With morning trading completed, the market tended to fluctuate sideways. Northern merchants were the main buyers and sellers, while large investors were not very active. The opening and closing prices in the morning were quite chaotic, with alternating ups and downs in each round, and the range of fluctuations gradually narrowed. The 96 bonds also did not fluctuate much, and trading volume decreased significantly. After the afternoon opening, Northern merchants suddenly made large-scale purchases, and various bonds were in demand. Market prices rose by 10 to 20 "jiao" or even 50 to 60 "jiao." The 96 bonds began to follow suit. The closing price saw a slight decline of 10 to 20 "jiao." Salt tax bonds remained strong as before, and the July issues of disarmament and consolidated tax bonds reached new highs, resulting in gains of 10 to 20 "jiao" to around 50 "jiao." It is feared that the trend will not be easily reversed in the short term. The 96 bonds are temporarily consolidating due to the strong bullish position, as market prices are very low, making it easier for buyers to acquire goods. Generally, compared to the prices before the September 18th Incident, the 96 bonds still seem low. Therefore, the future trend may still see another rise. The total turnover was 10,022,500 yuan. There were no spot transactions. The futures market saw significantly less activity for the 96 bonds, with only 1,666,500 yuan traded. Salt tax bonds saw 2,550,000 yuan, consolidated tax bonds 1,295,000 yuan, and the 20 bonds 1,225,000 yuan. Other trades were mostly in the range of 700,000 to 800,000 yuan, with some as low as 50,000 to 60,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn Mills Lower Bids, Pressuring Down Yarn Prices</h3>
<p>The yarn market weakened again due to sluggish actual sales and a lack of vitality among various trading groups, entirely affected by financial drought. However, buyers are still betting on high cotton prices and the difficulties faced by mills to increase prices. However, sluggish consumption and fierce competition among Japanese merchants are further undermining local yarn.</p>
<p>Bids for "Renbiao" Yarn Fall by One Yuan: In the opening market, there was a lack of buyers. Mills, fearing inconsistencies due to suspended night shifts, and with some mills selling off yarn, prices for all months fell by 8 "jiao" to 1 yuan 1, 3, 4, and 7 "jiao." The market remained weak in the afternoon, with nearby months rising by 4 and 5 "jiao" and distant months remaining flat. Total turnover for the day was 45,200 bales. Sales included 2,000 bales by Senkang, 1,000 bales by Shenji, 1,500 bales by Yongda, 1,200 bales by Renfeng, 2,450 bales by Changyu, 1,350 bales by Yuanda, and 1,700 bales by Tongban. Purchases included 1,800 bales by Jifeng, 1,300 bales by Ji, 1,900 bales by Mingde, 3,450 bales by Gengfeng, and 1,600 bales by Lichang. Closing prices are as follows:</p>
<p>Closing Prices for "Renbiao" Yarn, Change, and Open Interest:</p>
<p>Month	Closing Price	Change	Open Interest</p>
<p>October	19.71	Down 0.12	72,800</p>

<h3>Traders Purchase Spot Yarn</h3>
<p>Sales of spot yarn remain sluggish, but purchases by traders have increased. Statistics show that various trading groups purchased a total of 2,090 bales throughout the day. Prices fell by 5 "jiao." Purchase amounts by trading group are as follows:</p>
<p>Guangdong:	140</p>
<p>Inland:	20</p>
<p>Shantou:	20</p>
<p>Nanjing:	5</p>
<p>Sichuan:	150</p>
<p>Traders:	1,550</p>
<h3>Foreign Firms Bid on Cotton</h3>
<p>The cotton market was flat in the morning and rose in the afternoon due to purchases by foreign firms, leading to speculation about a squeeze on current-month old cotton. This caused market sentiment to stir, and buying resumed with short covering. However, with foreign cotton suspended and gold prices falling again, sellers continued to unload in distant months. It is difficult to be certain about the future trend.</p>
<h3>Zheng Cotton Rises by 20 to 30 "Jiao"</h3>
<p>The Zheng cotton market opened firm in the morning due to purchases by Japanese merchants, with prices for all months rising by 5 "fen." The market situation turned stronger in the afternoon due to a lack of sellers in the market, with prices for all months rising by 2, 3, and 4 "jiao." Total turnover for the day was 61,000 "dan." Sales included 3,100 "dan" by Yuanda, 2,000 "dan" by Shenchang, 1,800 "dan" by Xincheng, 1,100 "dan" by Changhe, and 1,500 "dan" by Yuda. Purchases included 3,000 "dan" by Yuchang, 5,000 "dan" by Gengfeng, 2,400 "dan" by Dafeng, 1,100 "dan" by Changfeng, and 1,500 "dan" by Chunji. Closing prices are as follows:</p>

<p>Ling Mai Cotton: 53.00 yuan, purchased by Sanyou Factory, 83 pieces, delivered at the warehouse.</p>
<h3>U.S. Cotton Suspended, British Rises, Indian Falls</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the U.S. cotton market was closed for Independence Day. The Liverpool cotton market saw spot prices rise by 3 points and futures prices rise by 4-5 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices rose by 7 points. The Bombay cotton market fell due to long liquidation. As a result, Pinggar fell by 2 rupees and 7.5 annas, and Omra and Bairoxi both fell by 2 rupees and 2.5 annas. Original telegram recorded left (4th dispatch).</p>

<h3>Grains</h3>
<p>Existing Wheat Surges Amidst Noise</p>
<p>Futures for Flour and Wheat Both Decline</p>
<p>After the flour market opened this morning, each of the futures months showed a downtrend. As to foreign wheat quotations, Chicago had no market, while Canadian wheat was down by about 20 "jiao." Although present flour sales are still brisk, factory inventories are also plentiful. Additionally, existing wheat supplies are arriving in a steadily strong stream. All of the mills are still uniformly bearish, unloading both near-term and far-term positions. Although there were also some purchases by outside long speculators, they were ultimately repressed by the unfavorable environment, declining by one cent relative to yesterday's closing price. By the time the market opened this afternoon, prices had fallen slightly, with the current month falling as low as 7.5 "fen" and August as low as 30 "jiao." Later, with news from the northern factions that the rebel army had been dealt with, there was some inevitable buying activity. Large mills were also preparing to load out goods for sale, so prices in all months seemed to rise slightly. However, the low price of existing wheat has reached an extreme, and if present sales are not brisk, it will still be difficult to make a firm determination. As a result, prices were down one cent compared to yesterday. August was down 1.25 "li," September was down one cent, October was down 0.75 "li," November was down 1.25 "li," and December was down 1.5 "li."</p>
<p>After the wheat market opened this morning and afternoon, all months showed a uniform downward trend. As to foreign wheat quotations, American wheat had no market, while Canadian wheat was down by about 20 "jiao." Under these circumstances, market sentiment naturally trended bearish. Furthermore, existing wheat supplies are currently arriving in a strong stream. Mills’ buying interest, however, remains stagnant. It is said that an average of 50,000 to 60,000 bags have arrived in Wuxi daily, while sales have only been 10,000 to 20,000 bags. This situation has not been seen in many years, so it is difficult to make a firm determination on the overall situation. As a result, the July contract fell by 4 "fen" compared to yesterday, August fell by 3 "fen," September fell by 1 "fen," October fell by 3 "fen," and November fell by 2 "fen." The existing wheat situation has become even more bleak. In terms of arrivals, there were over 20,000 additional bags. Fuxin has stopped buying, and Fufeng has made slight purchases, but only picking high-quality goods. Medium-quality and low-quality wheat is not being touched. It is said that 4,000 bags of Hankou wheat, which has not been seen in two or three years, will also be imported, so the future of existing wheat is truly problematic. Opening prices: Kunshan wheat at 3.60 yuan, second-quality at 5.56 yuan, Shuangfeng wheat at 3.456 yuan, Wuqi wheat at 3.52 yuan, Yangzhou wheat at 3.62 yuan, and Tongguan special high-quality wheat at 3.75 yuan. Over 4,000 bags were opened, purchased by Fufeng.</p>
<h3>Ke Xian and Zhejiang Rice Continue to Sell Briskly</h3>
<p>|Medium and Low Grades Are All Tight|</p>
<p>Yesterday, Du Xian rice and Zhejiang rice continued to sell briskly. Min rice also saw some demand. Xiang high-grade rice has dried up on the market, and the supply of medium and low grades is also gradually decreasing. Arrivals are not strong, and with brisk sales by Ke merchants, market sentiment and the market as a whole have become tight. However, with ample supplies of River Bottom rice and foreign rice, it is not easy to see prices rise. The high-grade Ke Xian rice that Ke merchants prefer is in short supply both in terms of arrivals and inventories, so brisk sales cannot be fully achieved. The rice sold yesterday, apart from Nanjing Che Xian rice, was all medium and low-grade. Daily sales included 320 bags of Jiangxi machine-milled late-season second-grade rice at 7.56 yuan, and 471 bags of machine-milled early-season large-grain rice at 7.01 to 7 yuan. Hunan Jing rice was 1,100 bags at 6.66 to 6.5 yuan, and second-grade brown rice was 200 bags at 5.97 yuan. Nanjing machine-milled rice was 500 bags at 7.19 to 7.1 yuan, and brown rice was 500 bags at 6.3 yuan. Among these, over 500 bags of Hunan rice and Jing brown rice were purchased by Fuzhou merchants. 200 bags of Hunan 　Jing rice were purchased by merchants on this street to Hunan, and the rest were purchased by Zhejiang merchants from Wenzhou and Taizhou.</p>
<h3>Rice Market Arrivals are Scarce, Prices Rise by 10 to 20 "Jiao"</h3>
<p>Arrivals in Shanghai South on the 20th to 30th of the month. Shops on this street have inventory, but sales are not brisk. Fortunately, arrivals are not high, and sellers seized the opportunity to tighten prices. As a result, Chang, Su, Tong, and South Port Hou Geng rice and Du Jian rice prices have risen by 10 to 20 "jiao." Ke merchants, facing a chaotic situation in northern China and depreciated market prices, did not actively buy. The 100-200 bags they bought were only to cover shorts. Bo Dao rice from Qingjiao, Songjiang, etc., was mostly sold in small quantities to various destinations. The market situation is slightly improved.</p>
<p>Arrivals in Shanghai North on the 17th to 18th of the month. Sales of Bai Geng rice are still passable on the market, with prices up by about 20 "jiao." Arrivals of Bo Dao rice are low, with balanced sales and tight prices, up by 10 "jiao." Arrivals of early rice are lacking. Yang Jian rice has balanced arrivals and sales, with prices trending tight. Machine-milled Du Jian rice and埠客Jian rice have also risen by nearly a foot, with prices standing firm.</p>
<h3>Seafood: New Cuttlefish Harvest Poor, Prices Rise</h3>
<p>Cuttlefish (dried cuttlefish), produced in Daishan, Zhoushan, Shengshan, Sijiao, Liuheng in Zhejiang, as well as Yantai in Shandong, Lianshui and Siyang in Jiangsu, etc. The annual production ranges from 20,000 to 30,000 "dan" to at least 10,000 "dan." The main sales regions are the five provinces of Sichuan, Hunan, Jiangxi, Fujian, and Guangdong. Sales in inland areas on this street are limited. Due to the cool weather this year, the cuttlefish did not thrive. According to reports from various production areas, the harvest is less than half of last year, leading to a limited supply and insufficient demand. Market prices have therefore risen. Yesterday, the sales price for Yantai goods was 47 yuan, Shengshan goods 25 yuan, and Daishan goods 26.5 yuan. The market situation is quite tight, with potential for further price increases.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Coarse Sand and White Sugar Prices Fall Back</h3>
<p>Yesterday, sugar prices declined as import duties and gold prices saw some slight declines, trending flat and weak. At the trade association's board, the initial transaction price for ordinary coarse sand and white sugar was 20.1 yuan per 100 bags, but later dropped by 0.08 yuan, 0.05 to 0.07 yuan less than the previous day. High-quality KW sugar was priced at 20.15 yuan. The trade association's posted price for ordinary sugar was the same. Dutch Red KD sugar was 16 yuan. The Zhenji factory opened bids for No. 1 cotton white sugar at 19.45 yuan, while Nos. 2, 3, 4, and 5 were held back. Zhenji No. 1 rock sugar was 22.8 yuan, and No. 2 was 0.2 yuan. The Siming factory's No. 1 rock sugar was 22.7 yuan. The Guangdong-Chaozhou trading group opened high bids for over 100 bags of Hainan Red sugar at 13.73 yuan, and over 100 bags of ordinary Huanggang Qingdi sugar at 13.5 yuan. (Yesterday's report of high bids for dozens of bags of cotton red sugar was a typographical error, and should have been thousands of bags). Taikoo Sugar BA was 21.3 yuan, with the rest held back.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Limited Summer Silkworm Rearing in Jiangsu</h3>
<p>Jiangyin Silkworm Eggs Almost Zero: Farmers in the four townships of Jiangyin, due to the poor yields and quality of summer silk in recent years, are extremely discouraged. There are very few summer silkworm rearers this year, and the amount reared is almost zero. The early batch will be two-sleep fully leaf-fed and some three-sleep ones. The silkworm eggs are developing quite well.</p>
<p>104 Bundles of Yellow Silk Shipped to Shanghai: The Min Gui vessel arrived in Shanghai from Chongqing yesterday, carrying 104 bundles of yellow silk from Wuyang, Mianzhou, Guopen, etc. The yellow silk merchants have already withdrawn the goods and stored them in the silk warehouse.</p>
<p>Rayon Sales Still Show No Improvement: Yesterday, only the Xiashi and Wuxing trading groups imported 16 boxes of Feima, Jinyu, and Sanqi brand July spot and futures goods at a price ranging from 168.75 yuan to 161.25 yuan net. The market outlook is weak.</p>
<p>Foreign Silk Market Turns Quiet: Yesterday, the silk market turned quiet. There was no market for white silk. Only 20 bundles of hand-reeled yellow silk were transacted at stable prices.</p>
<h3>Zhen Mei Green Tea Sales Brisk, Prices Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday, at the foreign silk market in Shanghai, the Xiehe, Jinlong, and Yihe foreign firms, which ship Zhen Mei green tea to Morocco, showed strong interest. Goods from Tunxi, Suian, Yi County, and other areas saw market prices increase by 3 to 4 yuan due to scarce inventory. Du De and Yongxing continued to source Zhen Mei from the Beixiang area of Wuyuan. Goods made using the Tunxi method were sold out as soon as they arrived. However, those still using a waxy finish and overly coarse strands were not easily sold. The prices of other items such as pearl tea and needle tea all trended upwards. Only Wenzhou Zhen Mei saw slightly lower market prices due to the impact of low-priced Japanese tea sales.</p>
<h3>The Main Reason for the Stagnant State of the Broadcloth and Woolen Fabric Market</h3>
<p>Historically, after an increase in customs duties, the broadcloth and woolen fabric market would experience a surge, with prices trending higher and transactions increasing, and many in the industry would absorb goods from each other. This time, the opposite is true. Since the announcement and implementation of the new customs duties, the broadcloth and woolen fabric market has remained weak. In the two months since, apart from raincoat fabric, which has risen slightly by 10 to 20 "jiao," even the plain gabardine, which has typically sold well, has actually seen a price decline. Wholesale transactions are extremely rare. The main reason for the stagnation is that the tax increase came at the height of summer, when the broadcloth and woolen fabric business is typically slow. The number of buyers naturally dwindled, and they mostly folded their hands and watched. As a result, those holding goods were anxious, making it difficult to raise prices. On the other hand, the renewed activity of Japanese goods dumping sales has also had an impact. In addition, the unstable domestic situation and tight credit conditions, coupled with the crowded arrivals of broadcloth and woolen fabrics in the second half of the year, have caused many who have placed orders to worry. They are all willing to first sell off old goods to get cash to pay taxes and then bring in new goods. The market could not advance as a result. Taxing the new goods, for example, on average Melton new cloth has to be paying the duty which costs over one yuan per yard. However, the old cloth that sold in the market right now generally sale two and a half yuan per yard, it even less transaction on it. The seller and buyer both know that it is because the tariff increased dramatically which result in increasing costs but the old cloth cheap, however no one dare to try to purchase it. (On the past opportunity for the insider or outsider investors that will purchase it without hesitate) The current poor situation in the market is obvious.</p>
<h3>The Lead and Zinc Market: Covert Price Softening</h3>
<p>Lead and zinc trading has been quite stagnant recently. The Yellow Dan factory, paint companies, and tin foil factories, which used to sell well, have all seen a sharp decline in business due to sluggish actual sales. Export-oriented trading groups such as Tianjin, Yantai, Hankou, and Fujian have also reduced purchases, resulting in a very cold market. Due to market sentiment, there is a strong desire to sell, and the covert softening of prices is an undeniable fact. Yesterday, the market price for Citibank lead was 16.7 yuan per "dan," down 0.1 yuan from the previous day. Indian lead was 16.9 yuan, also down slightly by 0.05 yuan. Canadian lead sold for 16.8 yuan, unchanged from the previous day, but the overall tone was no longer as firm as before. It is said that overseas prices are still increasing sharply, with current prices at around 35 yuan per ton. However, with the recent slump in the U.S. dollar, the overall cost remains low. Therefore, it may be difficult for the market to rebound in the short term.</p>

<p>Talks</p>
<h3>On Smoking</h3>
<p>— Jie Xin</p>
<p>The life in the city can make people numb. What is needed is stimulation and regulation. I heard that "smoking" is the best way to regulate the spirit and excite the nerves, so many people have gone to smoking.</p>
<p>Speaking of tobacco, there are many kinds of tobacco. In addition to dry tobacco, water tobacco, cigarettes, and cigars, there is also opium. The first two types of tobacco, although they are relics of the times, are probably extinct in our metropolis Shanghai. In those declining villages, many yellow-skinned, emaciated male and female laborers still have one in each of their hands during their leisure time.</p>
<p>Cigars, apart from a few big-bellied merchants sitting in Dodge cars and living in foreign houses, and the general bourgeoisie, are not allowed to ask about them. If a couch is horizontally arranged and the opium is floating like a fairy, only a few friends who have cultivated themselves in life and are destined to enjoy happiness can enjoy it. The rest can only swallow soil and eat three-headed water, which is considered to have satisfied their old addiction. These people are mostly exceptions, so I won’t talk about them.</p>
<p>Only cigarettes are like universal education. From the old men, wives, and young ladies who eat Three-Nine brand and Camel cigarettes, to the little concubines who eat Ketou brand, everyone has one in their hands, swallowing clouds and spitting fog. There are also many underage youths who have this kind of hobby. In the school dormitory, cigarette cases of various colors and styles are scattered all over the ground. If a student does not use cigarettes during class, it is considered that the student has left some dignity for the teachers, which is very authentic.</p>
<p>There are also a few old guns who pull rickshaws and take the money they earn by sweat. Today's meal is not planned, and the cigarette in their mouths is a must when pulling the rickshaw. Others, such as men and women beggars sitting on the roadside, or the old Jiangbei women selling small candies, if they don't eat cigarettes, I am afraid that the tune of "Ladies and gentlemen, please do good deeds" will be difficult to utter, so they must eat them.</p>
<p>Oh, tobacco, tobacco, harmful tobacco!</p>
<h3>A Street Account</h3>
<p>— Huan Yi</p>
<p>From the intense electric light streaming out of the large glass showcases, reflected on the pedestrian path were the various expressions of joy, sorrow, worry, and depression of each person coming and going. The walls of human flesh on either side blocked the dark, oily asphalt road. Cars, rickshaws, bicycles, trams, and delivery vehicles were like floating leaves in a rapid current, flowing with the ebb and flow of the wild tide.</p>
<p>"Pig! Do you want to die?" This was the only warning the car driver gave to the rickshaw puller. Of course, these are two different means of transportation in this era of class division. No wonder those riding in cars are so arrogant.</p>
<p>The Indian patrolman with a face full of pimples held the traffic light switch, controlling the passing vehicles. In his sharp whistle, he called out the blood-red light, exerting his authority. Even the cars that recklessly charged across the road had to bow their heads and wait quietly for his command at this time. The rickshaw pullers also borrowed the favor of the red light, stretching their necks and gasping for a few breaths of the cold air stuck in their chests.</p>
<p>From within the thronging crowd, the sounds of the sanxian and erhu were intermittently sent out. A burst of applause stirred up the performer's final effort. Although the transition from Erhuang to Xipi in the melody told us that his voice had already broken, after finishing the performance, he then issued a desolate, hoarse tone, saying to the audience: "I haven't earned money for tonight's dinner yet. Please help me out and give me another chance to perform." So the erhu sound rose again, and the voice like knocking on a cracked bamboo tube continued.</p>
<p>The most conspicuous embellishment on the cement floor was the territory of the wandering literati. One every five steps, one every ten steps, kneeling as if they were pious men and women on a pilgrimage path, English, Chinese, clerical script, regular script, cursive script, and seal script, reversed characters... a dazzling array under the electric light, like opening a calligraphy exhibition. Moreover, they wrote a long passage of glorious resume, wanting people to know that they were not born so destitute, that they had once held titles such as section chief, bureau chief, battalion commander, and regimental commander. As for spreading out a high school or university diploma as evidence, that has become a common occurrence. But what are their daily gains? They only earn the criticism of the passing literati and scholars, pointing out whether their writing is fluent, whether their calligraphy has been trained, and whether their brushstrokes are vigorous!</p>
<p>The girls by the roadside only wander within a short distance, their paper-gray faces covered with wall-ash-like powder and pig-blood-like rouge, each fully revealing the allurement of their abnormally developed flesh. However, when we see the old women standing next to them, constantly throwing them glances of reproach, we can know the misery and suffering they endure. But as long as a man approaches them, they will definitely show a forced smile, hurriedly dragging him, "Sir, please come in!" Then, an old woman will definitely follow up, saying, "Our girl just came from the countryside, sir. Let me be your matchmaker," indicating that she is still a virgin, or at least wanting to believe that she is a prostitute with few customers. Ah! The taste of a virgin, no one wants to miss it. But if we are willing to calm down, then you will definitely understand the crying behind her laughter, "Sir, please save me!"</p>
<p>The gongs and drums of the Great World have ceased. Tourists surge out like a tide. Indeed, many people have had a great time, laughing and returning home to rest, exhausted from their fun. However, some people are upset, feeling hopeless about their livelihood today. They also feel the economic recession in society, which has affected the pockets of the visitors to the Great World. They only scurry around on the road, east and west, hoping for the arrival of dawn. They look forward to a new life tomorrow every day! But what about tomorrow?......</p>
<p>The patrolman is off duty. The traffic lights are also resting. On the deathly silent road, only the cars are unscrupulously acting as the favored ones of the late night. The hand of the clock near the red light is moving forward minute by minute, but how long will it be until the sky dawns?......</p>

<h3>In the Girls' Dormitory</h3>
<p>— Shao Jun</p>
<p>In the girls' dormitory.</p>
<p>The room is on the top floor of a four-story building. Below are the library, classrooms, and offices. That is where the girls' dormitory of X University is located.</p>
<p>One day, I, having been introduced by Lao Wang (no, led by him), walked into this towering four-story building—the girls' dormitory. There, there were wives, young ladies, and Lao Wang's friends—some said they were Lao Wang's sweethearts. There, there was French perfume, Hazelie cold cream, the best rouge, face powder... and also high-heeled shoes, long stockings, nude photos, Fenya</p>
<p>Four people lived in the room: Miss Fang, a friend of Lao Wang's; Miss Zhang, the wife of a certain Mr.; Miss Ying, the daughter of a certain prominent family; and Miss Ouyang, the school flower, no, the queen, of X University. They were all modern girls, beautiful, lively, and charming.</p>
<p>The beds, tables, and floors were all very messy. Chocolate candies, spiced peanuts, and "Claw King" were placed on the tables and beds. Paper scraps, melon seed shells, and peanut skins were scattered all over the tables and floors. There were also ink bottles, exercise books, lecture notes, "Romance of the West Chamber," "Dream of the Red Chamber"... all piled in a corner of the table, covered with some dust.</p>
<p>A burst of laughter suddenly entered my ears, so sharp, so loud, so melodious, as moving as a symphony orchestra in a dance hall. This was the laughter of Miss Fang, Lao Wang's friend. She showed Lao Wang the coy posture unique to modern girls, laughing and looking, looking and laughing. Lao Wang returned her a smile, and the room was filled with laughter, a burst after another.</p>
<p>Lao Wang sat on Miss Fang's bed, Miss Fang's face facing Lao Wang, smiling sweetly.</p>
<p>"I want to ride a bike today." Her voice was high-pitched.</p>
<p>"When did you learn to ride a bike?"</p>
<p>"I'm not proficient yet, I just started learning!"</p>
<p>"Who taught you?"</p>
<p>"Miss Chen!"</p>
<p>"Chen... Chen what?"</p>
<p>"......"</p>
<p>Miss Fang laughed, and Lao Wang also laughed. But I thought Lao Wang's laughter was very unnatural.</p>
<p>I heard all these few sentences very clearly. Afterwards, I also saw Miss Fang talking very intimately with Lao Wang, lightly, and I didn't know what they were talking about.</p>
<p>Miss Zhang, Miss Ying, and Miss Ouyang were all silent, and the room was very quiet.</p>
<p>In the silence, I stood up. French perfume, Hazelie cold cream, high-heeled shoes, nude photos...</p>
<p>Flashed in my eyes again.</p>
<p>I slowly moved my steps, walking closer to the note written in ink in front:</p>
<p>"Life is originally eating, eating!"</p>
<p>It is said that this was Miss Zhang's handwriting. The clear and lively calligraphy really made me admire her. Obviously, she was a hedonist. She saw through the meaning and value of life, and she was a disciple of Yang Zhu.</p>
<p>Further on, there was another note written in ink:</p>
<p>"Life is originally sighing, sighing!"</p>
<p>It is said that this was Miss Ying's handwriting, and the characters were also delicate. She was a pessimist, and perhaps her environment was the worst among the four.</p>
<p>Walking two steps further, there was another one:</p>
<p>"Life is originally ha, ha!"</p>
<p>This was Miss Ouyang's handwriting. She was an optimist, and perhaps she was the most optimistic among the four.</p>
<p>As for Miss Fang, I never saw any note written by her. Perhaps she didn't want people to know about her. If you want to know, you can only ask Lao Wang.</p>
<p>There was another burst of laughter in the room. Miss Zhang, Miss Ying, Miss Fang, and Miss Ouyang all stood up. This sharp, melodious laughter sent us out of the girls' dormitory.</p>

<p>OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO</p>
<h3>Old Guan's Dream</h3>
<p>Editor:</p>
<p>I am a young man with no relatives to rely on. I have always been a shop assistant in a tea shop, but now I am in a state of limbo between life and death. I can't think of a solution myself. Please give me some guidance. The reason is that in Wusong Town the year before last (i.e., 1931), two friends, who were deeply sympathetic to me, lent me several hundred dollars so I could start a small business of my own, as a permanent means of livelihood, to avoid being dependent and running around. These two friends really had good intentions. I opened a small tea shop on Xinlu in the town. The business was not bad and was enough to cover expenses. Unexpectedly, the "January 28th" Shanghai Incident occurred, and the entire town of Wusong was completely engulfed in artillery fire. My shop was the first to be burned by the short bandits. So I returned to my hometown to live, with nothing but myself left. After the war ended, I came to Shanghai to seek opportunities, but who knew that until February of this year, I was still unemployed. It was then that my two well-intentioned friends, feeling sorry for my long unemployment, lent me money again, instructing me to restore my old business to maintain my livelihood. So I opened another shop on Datong Road in the British Concession of Shanghai, running my old business. Who knew that I would still fail completely? In desperation, I asked my younger brother to temporarily maintain the status quo while I returned to my hometown to raise funds to revive the business. But the rural economy was very difficult, and everyone was poor, so it goes without saying that I would be denied. I could only sigh to the sky, alas! I have no way to go! I only have suicide as a path. I think that I am a young man with limbs and senses, who can roughly read and write. I have an elderly mother above me and younger siblings below me, all of whom have no ability to support themselves, so I still cling to my last breath and struggle. But the money my two close friends lent me was not their own, but borrowed from their friends on my behalf. The total amount borrowed was no less than a thousand yuan. Now I have to pay fourteen yuan in interest and eleven yuan in dues every month. But the moribund shop is already closed. I don't use a penny myself, so where can I find the twenty-five yuan in interest and dues every month? If I continue to work as a tea shop assistant, it is really difficult to find one at this time. Even if I find one, the monthly salary is only five or six yuan. How can I deal with these two amounts of payment? If I don't care about it, how can I get past my conscience? If I ask my two friends to help me to the end, their burden is already not light, and their current environment is not as good as before, so how can they bear my burden again? If I say I want to find a position with a monthly salary of twenty or thirty yuan, this is even more difficult. My situation is really between life and death, in a position where I cannot advance or retreat. Please, sir, help me solve this problem! And may you have peace.</p>
<p>Respectfully, Wu Lunyin</p>
<p>X X X X</p>
<p>Editor's Note: In this recession year, taking out capital to run a business is very dangerous. Those with strong capital seem to be able to maneuver easily and avoid failure; but where are our capitalists the match for international capitalism? The result is one failure after another. As for wanting to start a business with a few dollars borrowed at high interest, it is really a dream, and nine times out of ten you will fail. Therefore, we have repeatedly advised people who do not have much money to be more opportunistic and take what they can get. Some people may refute us by saying that if everyone does this, where will they find something to take? We believe that people with strong capital, even if they see that it is "not a business," cannot "open their eyes and take poison." Otherwise, society will inevitably be in chaos, and capitalists will not escape bankruptcy either. In short, the current situation, worldwide! Not necessarily limited to China! Is creating the downfall of capitalists. At this time, we can only wait quietly. When the real capitalists reach the end of the road, that will be the day when our new life begins. Your first experiment failed, and you should not try again the second time. Now, if you still want to be a boss, in our opinion, it is simply asking for trouble. You should find an existing position to do. If the monthly salary can be about thirty yuan, you can pay off the interest and dues, which can be considered your conscience. Even if the monthly salary is very small and you cannot afford the interest and dues, there is nothing you can do. You should know that unless you intend to default, you have nothing to be sorry for. However, this loan of yours was borrowed by your friend on your behalf, then you should stand up and turn all your assets, no matter how much, into money, and divide it equally among them; for the remaining amount, negotiate a clear settlement and establish the kind of "prosperous ticket" that is common in society and never defaults. We must know that in this era, capitalists are not willing to take care of the poor; we poor people should not bother to care for the capitalists. Tearing down the rotten mess may even make our ideal era come sooner!</p>

<h3>Under the Red and Green Light (19)</h3>
<p>— Xi Lin</p>
<p>(12) The pride of a woman made her determined to snatch him away from Meizi's side.</p>
<p>He regretted going to Chen's mansion with Wang Hua, that scoundrel. Now his plan to start a publication was stalled. He was especially worried about the big talk that Wang Hua had made at Chen's mansion. If he couldn't contact more than a hundred groups, what would he do? If Old Chen saw through it, how would they get the activity funds? Hey, Wang Hua, that short devil!</p>
<p>He didn't know he had taken the wrong way. Suddenly, a large group of people burst out from the alley across the street. People on the road rushed over like crazy, and he also curiously walked over. Then he saw a person being caught on the ground in the crowd. Everyone surrounded him, beating, kicking, and stomping on him.</p>
<p>"Strike him, strike him, beat that short devil to death!" Everyone cursed as they beat him. Shi Qiao almost thought it was Wang Hua, that short devil. Upon closer inspection, he realized it was a XX short devil. A kind of intense national hatred was vented on him alone. He had already been beaten down to the ground, but the people beating and kicking him were still beating and kicking, some even laughing as they beat him. Shi Qiao also felt very happy. The people standing in the back gradually dispersed. When several French patrolmen arrived, even the people beating and kicking him disappeared in a flash.</p>
<p>Shi Qiao couldn't help but avoid them, turning a corner on the road.</p>
<p>You see, as long as we are willing to increase our efforts to advocate and inspire, the masses can definitely be mobilized. You see, just now they caught a XX plainclothes team member... As he thought about this, he concluded that he had to start a publication. From the publication, he couldn't help but think about the three meal tickets in his pocket. Only three left, only three left.</p>
<p>He walked to the door and saw 難級五木陽 at 門看見 在.</p>
<p>"Just now a man named Zhou came to see you!" Meizi called out to him. "He said to please go to the garrison headquarters to see the one named Zhang, saying the one named Zhang is locked in jail."</p>
<p>Shi Qiao seemed to have expected Zhang Honglie's imprisonment, and did not express surprise. He just wondered if Zhou Shaoping and others had really been to the front line. He was very suspicious. Just then, the Third Concubine came down from upstairs.</p>
<p>"Brother Qiao, where have you been these days?" The Third Concubine always had a charming smile on her face. Shi Qiao seemed to feel unfamiliar with this smile again, and at the same time felt that this smile opened up the depression that had come from earlier this morning. As usual, he found it difficult to answer the Third Concubine fluently, always staring with a pair of eyes that seemed to smile but didn't.</p>
<p>"You came just in time, I'm really bored, accompany me to the French Concession to take a walk!" As usual, the Third Concubine didn't need to get his answer, and pulled Shi Qiao away as she pleased.</p>
<p>His head seemed to be thinking about something else. He resolutely walked to her side;</p>
<p>"Meizi; don't walk on the road these few days, so as not to cause people to misunderstand you are a Japanese female spy!"</p>
