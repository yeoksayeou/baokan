<h3>救濟絲業之衰落</h3>
<p>— 明</p>
<p>蠶絲爲我國農村之主要副業。可以調劑農業經濟之歪倚可以補助農民個人之不足。同時且爲自給自足理想前提之一。故於我國國民經濟之前途。具有莫大關係。溯自海禁開後。閉關自守之農業經濟。不克與資本主義組織相競爭。其勢甚明。然而國際收支之平衡。猶有待於輸出貿易。而我國輸出貿易中。捨大豆外。即推生絲及絲織品。但自一九二九年經濟恐慌發生以來。通世界各國一般消費能力。莫不逐漸降低。絲業亦同受影響。日徘徊於衰落途程之中。即以我國生絲及絲織品之輸出而論。去前兩年相較。輸出價値即减少二分之一。絲貨堆積至三萬五千餘擔。絲業者虧蝕總計達一千二百萬兩以上。祗就江浙兩省絲廠言。具近代組織之廠家。計有一百八十七家。（四川交通阻滯。歷經兵燹。與其他省分出産較少者皆暫時排除不計）此一百八十七家絲廠中能勉强攩持門面者。僅十四家而已。現在歐美絲市。依然停滯。且市價復告跌落。本年秋季。較春間絲價竟又跌落三分之一。雖曾發行絲業短期公債三百萬元。有每擔給補助費一百四十元之舉。而盃水車薪。殊無補於實際。設使海外絲市再無起色。則絲業前途。更不知將伊於胡底矣。</p>
<p>吾人細考過去歷史。獻察當日情實。深悉我國絲業衰落之原因。第一。海外市場。再難容受以前同量之貨物。加以人造絲製品日見進步。價格較蠶絲幾低一倍有奇。生絲市塲。旣漸被侵蝕。則絲業自難振奮。第二。我國近時一切工廠組織。雖有科學方法之名。實多因人事紛糾。往往不能建立純正之近代組織。計劃不週密。疏漏之處多而製絲方法又較舊。日本絲遂乘機而起致美國市場。幾全爲日絲所奪占。我國絲業。因此更感困頓。第三。我國産業經營。多憑自己主觀。上焉者勤謹將事。僅能自全。下焉者轉瞬消蝕。更不待讑。故對於市場需要。特别是海外市場需要。缺乏眞確認識。且亦未嘗悉心考察一般消費者之心理。生絲之輸出。雖不似他種之複雜。然歐美各織絲廠之需求何如。我應以如何製品應付。當加研究。乃以我國廠家與日本較。殊有愧色。第四。近代産業經營。已由中小産業經營轉而爲大産業組織。資力愈見集中。出品亦見改良。歐美與日本。皆以此而進步。我國産業家則反是。僅努力於眼前市場之爭取。不慮損及本身。又不能共同團結。以與海外勢力相抵抗。處此競爭激劇之際。安得而能自全也。</p>
<p>現在世界之頽勢旣成。經濟全局之殭化。是否可以得救。尙屬疑問我國産業界欲於此時打開新出路。誠大不易。然絶不能長此坐視其工廠歇業工人失所也。當前爲治標計。代求急效。惟有中國庫補助。或由實業部與財政部。共同籌劃。募集公債。收買現存生絲。以一部分輸出海外。另一部份製成綢緞。凡國有鐵道。及官營輪船。免費輸運各地。廉價轉入於消費者之手。則目前之難關。或可勉强渡過。至治本之方。則在培殖一般社會之消費力。使社會秩序安定。生産增加。一般生活水凖提高。以四萬萬廣大鞏衆。每人每月平均增加一圓之消費。其數即足以使現在停滯之經濟形勢。轉爲活潑。甚或可以牽動世界市面。絲業在整個經濟復興過程中。必能受其實惠。而漸次步入於更生之道。繁榮之塗。非然者。所謂救　。僅能支持一時。决　長久。故宜　治標之　開其始。治本之法繼其後。　與今日整個國民經濟。亦大有關係也。</p>

<p>（倫敦）　外相西門外次艾登明日將同赴日内瓦與軍縮會主席漢德森會商續開軍縮會會議事、英内閣决議在羅馬召集四强會議交換意見、以期告成軍縮公約、衆視羅馬爲天然集　地點、因德國不肯復返日内瓦也、但法國則愛日内瓦、此實主要困難、聞無論日内瓦有何作爲、英政府仍視其所草公約爲將來一切工作之基礎、再、日内瓦行將討論召集四强公約簽字國會議之可能性、（十六日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）　英外相西門與外次艾登已决定星期五啓赴日内瓦、今日軍縮會議主席漢德森曾藉長途電話奥兩人談話頗久、力言廿四日之主幹委員會議、有首席代表出席之必要、敦促兩人就道、聞兩人途經巴黎時、將勸法外長彭古同行、此外聞漢德森亦請意國、首席代表出席主幹委員會議、蓋漢氏猶希望挽救軍縮會議之瓦解也、（十六日國民電）</p>
<h3>灌國對德試探接近　薩爾問題謂可談判</h3>
<p>（巴黎）　外長彭古作日在衆院發表演說、將印成小册、分送各國政府及各國國會外交委員會、負責方面對於此事聲稱、由法國方面言之、國聯會及軍縮會談仍然存在、凡屬外交行動、均應以日内瓦爲歸宿、最近英國對於軍縮會議之游移態度、與日　意相墨索里尼對於國聯會之批評、均不能使法國改變態度、此外意法誤會業已消釋、而九月底英美法意四國同意之各點依然如故、由此兩層觀之、吾人尚可有若干希望、法意見地不同之點、　於日内瓦國際機關、彭古之　、始終信任國聯會及軍縮會議、而意大利則欲　若干强國之談判代替國聯會全體國家參加之各種國際會議、其相異之點如此、至談及與德國直接談判之可能時、則法國所抱之一般原則始終如一、即德國提出建議方案、再用外交手續、本乎國際合作及恊調之精神、加以研究及討論、例如關於薩爾區域之經濟關係、由現在起、即可進行談判、設一九三五年薩爾人民投票、决定薩爾劃歸法國、或歸還德國、則此事即變爲純屬法德間之一種問題、此外負責方面又謂法俄關係已充分改善、法國已派挍術委員前往蘇俄、代替已遣退之德國技師云、（十五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>法報披露德國密件　謂欲離間英法邦交</h3>
<p>（巴黎）　聞德國政府、曾對該國在南北美洲丨式代表、其秘密工作人員、寄出訓令、指示如何作反對法國宣傳之方法、此項秘密文件、本日爲此間「小巴黎人報」所發表、據云「法國係德國不可解之仇敵、」至英國則係「法國最强之與國對於德國最爲危險、故德國應在外交上、竭力擾亂此兩國之國交、」該文件論及德國對世界政策之見地、謂「德國無論如何、必須逹到修改和平條約之目的、德國所要求者、約有數種、（一）凡有德國少數民族之士地須歸還德國、（二）德國舊有殖民地須直截了當歸還德國、（三）德國應取得軍備眞正平等權、拒絶一切國際軍備監察制、此種要求欲如願以償、自屬其難、但德國在目下亦無他法可施、關於此事、世界輿論實占重要地位、故德國政府决意犧牲鉅最金錢、以獲得世界輿論之同情」云云、「小巴黎人報」謂、以上所言係德國宣傳之原則、至其所用方法隨後　行發表、（十六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>英主對我親近　保守黨議員主使館南遷</h3>
<p>（倫敦）　倫敦泰晤士報今日載下院保守黨議員倫恩一函、内稱、英國宜終止英使署在北平之孤立地位、英使應在南京或上海有駐節之處、俾可在寗或在滬每年常住六個月云、倫恩又言及十一月八日上議院討論此事之空泛、謂吾人政策如欲有效、則必須就英使在華所見之事實而判定之、不能在相距一萬哩外想像爲之而英使且必須與南京要人有密切接觸、如是方可達其目的、决不可以巾蔽目、暗中摸索消息、而間接成立其斷論也云、（十六日路透電）</p>
<h3>英國排斥日貨</h3>
<p>（倫敦）　今日商人及運輸業代表等在此</p>
<p>過一議案、請求政府依照渥太華會議所通過之原則、徵收進口稅、其稅率應等於國内與國外出産成本相差之數、以保護英本土印度及英帝國之製造家、（十五日路透電）</p>
<h3>美財長伍定退休</h3>
<p>羅斯福委毛根索代部</p>
<p>通貨膨脹派初步勝利</p>
<p>（華盛頓）　羅斯福政府中之第一次破裂現已發作、今日得悉財長伍定已於數日前呈請辭職、羅總統已决定給予休假、所謂休假者純爲保全顔面辦面辦法、羅總統刻在實際上爲財部主人翁、雖已委任農村金融救濟局主任毛根索爲代理部長、但毛氏不致掣羅總統的肘也、財政部次長艾芝遜亦辭職、目前毛根索暫代財部總長與次長兩職、官塲謂艾芝遜自動辭職以讓毛氏、但非官塲方面則謂艾芝遜以反對羅總統貨幣政策而辭職、</p>
<h3>政見不合給假休養</h3>
<p>伍定與艾芝遜意欲脫離財部之說、雖已謡傳無數星期、但今日忽成事實、華盛頓人士聞之恍似晴天霹靂、據羅總統宣佈、伍定從本星期杪起告假云、</p>
<p>查參院調查摩根銀公司營業時、曾牽涉伍定、指伍定爲聽從摩根等勸告經營投機事業而致富者之一、當時衆料伍定將因此辭職、但伍定依然未去、</p>
<p>伍定近患喉症、常由專家診治、數日前上書辭職、但羅總統未予接受、惟請其暫時擺脫一切行政事宜、專心休養、於是有今日伍定給假之宣佈、雖然、伍定一去、不復返矣、</p>
<p>倫敦今日對於華盛頓之新發展、至爲關切、蓋以伍定與艾芝遜二人皆爲主張穩健發幣者、如不長財政、則恐有貨幣政策逾出正軌之結果、</p>
<p>美國金價之未有更變、今日已使美元倐呈起色、英國匯兌平凖基金乃不復用以維持金幣、但爭購英鎊之潮流、又復湧起、加以華盛頓傳來財長易人之消息、美元遂又轉疲、而逹英鎊一枚合美幣五元四角一分半之新低度、</p>
<p>毛根索爲前駐土耳其美大使之子、年僅四十二、在閣員中比較爲年輕、曾受敎育於康乃爾大學、後入出版界、大　時供職海軍、追隨維總統多年、曾任紐約州農業顧問會會長、（十五日路透電）</p>
<h3>美國奇寒凍死念人　日本貨船擱損失甚鉅</h3>
<p>（紐約）　美國現奇寒、已凍死二十人、本塞爾凡尼亞州大雪深四十一吋、爲歷史所僅見、氣候不良、礙及航業、各大湖中有暴風吹過、其速度爲每小時四十哩、致有貨船兩艘擱淺、又有兩船到、皆受損毁、日本貨船一艘在加拿大祈美納斯口岸搁淺、聞損毁頗鉅、中西部各處遍地皆雪、氣候甚冷、（十六日路透電）</p>
<h3>代理部長贊助購金</h3>
<p>（紐約）　毛根索宣布堅决贊助羅斯福總統在國内外購金以望提高物價之政策、據紐約太陽報載稱、毛氏主張將美元中之金成分減半、而反對早日穩定幣價、羅斯福總統内閣之第一次分裂、衆視爲隱健貨幣派之失勢、現外間謡諑蠭起、或謂政府要員意見歧異、或謂財政部顧問史潑萊與聯邦備蓄銀行總裁白萊克均將辭職、垣街對於伍定與艾芝遜之辭職、並不十分注重、不過以爲此乃通貨膨脹派積極行其通貨運動之初步耳、（十六日路透電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）　頃聞財部重要人員續有更迭之象、伍定辭呈中、雖鄭重聲明、財部完全贊成總統貨幣政策、但外間盛傳、伍定實始終反對此種試騐、並謂財次艾志遜亦不贊同貨幣政策、故於伍定給假時、掛冠而去、又聞財部内伍定助理克銘士不久亦將辭職、財邦金融總顧問史普拉格係前英倫銀行顧問、素來反對膨脹通貨以救濟物價之低落、聞亦正嚴重考慮辭職問題、此外聯邦儲備局總裁聞不久亦將出缺、惟現任總裁白拉克本爲暫局云、（五十日國民電）</p>
<h3>貨幣疑雲益見濃厚</h3>
<p>（紐約）　數星期來證劵市塲中對於貨幣之疑雲、今日因財部大員之突然更迭而益見濃厚、垣街中人解釋伍定之給假、艾志遜之辭職、與毛根索之代部、均爲美政府對於膨脤通貨派之讓步、因伍定在華盛顿之貨幣戰爭中、始終公認爲財部内穩健派之領袖、而毛根索則夙以傾向於膨脹通貨著聞者也、故垣街中人認此番　迭、不致使抑低金元之進行受有阻斷云、（十五日國民電）</p>
<h3>國内國外衝動甚烈</h3>
<p>（紐約）　羅斯福總統欲予其、黃金計劃以完全之試騐、輔以同情的官員、不容他人阻撓、此間報紙之華盛頓訪電稱、羅總統爲美國最敏捷而最有心計之政治韜略家、</p>
<p>現已辭退財部次長職之艾芝遜今日聲稱、黃金計畫之　否適當、不獨渠抱疑念、即因羅總統私人情感而仍留職者亦與渠同抱一様疑念也云、艾芝遜爲銀行家摩根等之友、銀行家指斥金融善後社之收買黃金爲非法　　現爲代理財長之毛根索氏乃羅總統之摯友、其人曾從羅總統心腹顧問華倫敎授肆業、</p>
<p>官場對於昨日之發展、尚未有何評論、但參議員哈理遜謂通貨膨脹轉瞬即將實現、參議員湯未斯稱、美元金値旣已减半時、即可以國際恊定安定之、而白餘將用爲擴大貨幣的基礎、垣街現默無一語、紐約通報金融記者稱、吾人貨幣政策現向摧殘吾人通貨資産與投資的信用之方面進犯、未有制止美元流出之希望、必俟吾人黃金政策之完全撤銷而後可云、</p>
<p>摩根證劵團之清理、衆信爲垣街慮及膨脹之一證、傳聞英國現考慮臨時緊急法案、以期屏絕美國流出之資金、此訊傳至後、美元流出愈速、紐約美利堅報稱、美元行動之現狀、未必即爲黃金政策毫無能力之表示、因金融善後社大可在國外售出黃金、而收回大批美元也云、英財部次官羅斯現已起程返國、對於戰債解决之可能性、及美國金融之前途、表示悲觀、（十六日路透電）</p>
<h3>英法兩國最感不安</h3>
<p>（倫敦）　倫敦事業界皆以美元低少或將發生抑低英鎊價値之影響爲慮、惟英國鐵路收入仍多、而貿易亦頗擴張、尚可使人寛慰耳、白銀交易似純係投機性質、美國一方面在倫敦市場自由賣出、一方面在紐約極力購進、泰晤士報華盛頓訪電稱、羅斯福總統决計欲支配國際金市場、不獨欲在美國内、且欲在世界各處提高價格、此乃無可疑者、但美國公債之續跌、及歐洲通貨上之影響、終將使羅總統不能達其目的、美國物價迄未響應羅總統之政策云、（十六日路透電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）　衆視美財長伍定之去職、爲主張通貨膨脹派之勝利、蓋該派目伍爲彼等野心發展之制止機也、金融市場未受伍定辭職之影響、英國以平準基金維持幣價之行爲、法人頗感之、蓋英鎊之穩定較美元之穩定、尤有關係於法國也、（十六日路透電）</p>
<h3>購金政策運用滿意</h3>
<p>（華盛頓）　白宫聲稱、美總統覺其購金政策、運用滿意、故目前不擬變更計劃、今日已暫擱財幣問題、轉而注意於救濟失紙、對於赴白宫進謁之州長市長及各地方救濟主任等、力勸與中央政府在一月内雇用四百萬人之計劃完全合作、並鄭重聲明、政府不圖藉此救濟計劃、獲得任何政治利益云、（十五日國民電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）　國家復興案執行員約翰遜將軍現已向美總統報告復興案業規中、增多工作安置失業之條文、不盡爲人遵守、必須設法厲行云、（十五日路透電）</p>
<h3>倫敦之舞弊巨案　巨商哈曼判處徒刑十八個月</h3>
<p>（倫敦）　哈曼與朝鮮會社其他董事被控與日本輔助公司交易舞弊、以欺騙股東一案、今日已定讞、陪審員以爲哈曼實犯訴狀内所列罪條二十一點、故法官判哈徒刑十八個月、柯尼洛萊夫犯同謀之罪、判處徒刑六個月、但得寛赦、該會會總董龐斯與張格特無罪省釋、按此案之主角、在倫敦城歷史上甚負名望、蓋哈曼以錄事發跡、今日所管理之公司、其資本共達英金一千四百萬鎊、其有關之事業、有人造絲·金礦·油·橡皮·釀酒等、數年前曾以一萬六千鎊購英吉利海峽中之倫第島、在島内自鑄圜幣、印製郵票、並頒布法律種種、故一時　倫第島無冕王之號、後政府以哈曼鑄幣爲違法、哈遂失該島之主權、哈氏本擬於本年三月間赴遠東視閱朝鮮會議之産業、因被逮不能成行、（十五日路透電）</p>

<h3>何應欽談話</h3>
<p>一余今天來津、並無何項任務、以前經過、津許多次、全是路過、一次也未下車、平津是北方大埠、相距甚近、到了北平、焉可不到天津、所以此次特别找個機會前來看看、此地有些舊日同學、和一般名流、好久均未見面、今天也要會會、長城五口交還、不成問題、。此事日本方面已經說好、待至關外、兵營修妥、卽可實行、預料不久當能作到、岡村日前去平、對於通車通郵及灤東善後問題、並無止式接洽、雙方僅屬交換意見、通車或許於最短期内辦到但一切辦法、日前彼此會見、亦未詳談、通郵事、余尙未聞、灤東善後、亦無甚困難、原在各地駐在隊伍、仍然照舊、至於察省湯（玉麟）劉（桂堂）兩部衝突、由於爭防地而生誤會、兩人均有報告互稱獲勝、但據確訊、湯部或許有相當損失、此事由宋委員（哲元）就近調查、俟報告到後、方可明瞭眞象云云、</p>

<h3>中國近代敎育思想概觀（三）　舒靳城講述　孫育才筆記　▲新敎育思想促成的因素</h3>
<p>中國倘若在八十年前、没有一場鴉片戰爭、就是和外國人通商、我想最多也不過是在國際市場上作些公平交易而已、中國底社會現象、决不會像現在、更說不到式新敎育、又若經過鴉片戰爭之後、國勢勃興起來、確立爲世界强國、中國之戰、不被日本打倒、或義和國起義、眞能把「洋人」希退、我想中國現在的敎育制度、或者　是在遵行着數千年來流傳下來的科學制和書院制、也許世界上的某個國家會因羨慕吾國制度的優長、而毅然倣效呢、眞的一切制度、他的所以産生構成、其實都不能離開環境的驅策、而中國新敎育制度的採用、更完全爲外力所逼成、清光緒二十八日、張百熙奏訂學堂章程時、竟一筆鈎銷舊制度、而完全把西洋工業社會的敎育制度移植過來、他的根本原因、可以「勢逼處此」四字包括之、六十年來、中國新敎育思想的所以産生、雖然最重要的是爲了國際潮流的關係、但也自另有我國國内政治社會世界學術的種種特殊背景、共同促成、</p>
<p>六十年來、中國因國際資本帝國主義者的壓迫、以致社會上民窮財盡、政治十四分五裂、學術上因特抄襲、幾乎没有一件事、可滿人意、然而各種不滿意的現象之中、仍還稍爲有點潛在的進步、這一種進步、就是「自覺」、這普遍的自覺、實是近幾十年麰的特徵、中國的所以不亡也就賴着這一種自覺作用、六十年的來敎育思想、雖因環境變遷、而有種種變化、但細究起來、仍然是一脈相承地在自覺中進行、這是近代中國近代新育思想的總綱、</p>
<p>▲近代敎育思想變遷史表</p>
<p>近表敎育思想、雖然是在向自覺方向走、但在程度上、却是很有差别的的、最初是被動的、模倣的、現在是自動的、創造的、若拿時間來分别、那麽清季的敎育思想、是模倣的、民國以來的敎育思想、是自覺的、每期之中、又可分若干小節、列表如左、</p>
<p>近代中國敎育思想變遷史</p>
<p>模倣期（清代）（方言朸想軍備思想西學思想西藝思想西政思想）</p>
<p>自覺期（民國）（軍國民與軍事敎育思想實利與實用思想美感思想大同思想職業思想民治思想竪立思想科學思想科學思想非宗敎思想）</p>
<p>（國家思想公民思想黨化思想生産敎育思想鄉村敎育思想民衆敎育思想民族復興敎育思想女子敎育思想）</p>
<p>我們直了上面一張表、思想變遷史的大概、就可明白了、現在再來究其詳、爲求講解便利起見、特將上面錯縱複雜的那許多思想、併做五個時期來分别說明、</p>
<p>（一）中體西用時期丨（鴉片戰爭丨光緒末年）</p>
<p>敎育思想、是隨社會思想而變更、隨時代潮流而轉移的、這我們已一致公認了、我國從鴉片戰爭之後、中國底種種弱點、暴露於外、英法各國、便從此都紛紛來訂不平等條約、乘機欺侮、領事裁判權、利益均沾、傳敎游歷等事、無不由條約分别訂定、外人旣可深入内地、自由行動、於是中西人民的交際日繁、外人又常常持不平等條約上的權利、不時有欺侮官吏、凌辱人民的舉動、以致交涉事件也漸漸地多起來、因爲如此、所以中國當時的敎育思想、就全盤的領向模倣西洋化了、於是中學爲體西學爲用之說、便盛但、這句話怎麽講呢、意思就是把中國固有的文化學術做根基、做體系、而把西洋的文化學術、學來實地應用、寓有雖提倡西洋文化、而不忘國粹文物的含義、自然、「裁人之長、補已之短」這是萬古不易的天經地義、何况當時吾國的情形、又正是需要西學到極點呢、這築一個時期中我們可把他分作五方面來說明、</p>
<p>▲方言敎育思想　同治元年、總理衙門因鑒於國際交涉事日繁、陸續訂約通商的國家、有英法俄美瑞典挪威等國、所以首出倡　、設立京師同文館於北京、方言敎育思想、也便由此而始、同治二年、李鴻章奏設廣方言館於上海三年瑞麟等又奏設廣東同文館於廣州、都以敎授語言文字爲主旨、光緒二十八年以前、以上三館、實在是中國新敎育的高等敎育機關、尤其是把京師同文館當做總樞紐、牠的内容、可分三大類、第一是培植交涉人才、第二日翻譯西籍、第三是中等以上各學校多習外國語、他的影響、有外交人才輩出、西籍日籍翻譯等等、後來又因着敎會學校的提倡、和留學生制度的推波助瀾、竟漸漸地將手段變成目的了、</p>
<p>▲軍備敎育思想　自南京條約而後、幾乎萬事都須受外人底拘束、謀國之士、探知外人的所以戰勝我國、决非是偶然的、而是自有其堅甲利兵做後盾的、我國如眞欲自强、亦决非僅　了有折衝樽俎的外交人才、就能菱效、必得「以其人之道、遠治其人之身、」所以於同文館等設立之後、便接着有軍備思想的産生、當時朝野上下、旣人人有自强的心願、而對於東西洋各國的認識、又只單在堅甲利兵　那一點上着眼、所以軍備、就成爲敎育思想、時的中心了、無論國外留學、或國内設校、當時都無不以警軍經武爲目的、這種思想、自同文館設立起始、直錦廷到光緒二十八年、共計竟有四十餘年之多、眞是盛極一時、颢響且亦不淺、如　設兵工廠、翻譯西書、設水師武備學堂、派留學生專習陸軍、各校添授兵式操等、影響最大的、便是在近代中國敎育思想上、確立了軍國民敎育的基礎、</p>
<p>▲西學敎育思想　甲午戰爭以後、我國受創過甚、全國上下、都急愈以圖强、作爲一大要務、因此西學之風、一時盛極、庚子以後、實行新敎育制度、西學思想、於　普及一般敎育界、追溯這種思想由來、還是以外患爲唯一原因、西學的範圍、最初爲天文算學兩門、後來漸　紛歧、狹到僅指自然科學、廣到泛指西洋、切文化、西學敎育思想、在時間上共錦延　六十多年、六十年中、中國政治上學術上各種事情、差不多直接間接無不受他的影響、最顯著者、第一是同治五年京師同文館天文算學館的添設、第二是戊戍而後、庚子以前的各種中西學堂、第三是改行新敎育制度以後各級學校底科學的科目、第四是西洋文化的吸收、</p>
<p>▲西藝敎育思想　西藝原是西學的一部份、甲午而後、西學的思想、又進一步、乃以自然科學和應用科學另立爲西藝、他的産生原因、也是由於外力的堅甲利兵所反映、而其發展、則由於清末新敎育的無　實用、其最　者　事爲、第一是西洋物質文明原動力的認識、第一是實業學堂的發達、第三是、爲什而學、的　念逐漸漸打破、第四是從認識西洋工藝底優點中更推而産視西洋技藝、只可惜所　實業學常、遊學習藝等的設施、大半是些紙上文章、所以幾十年來、中國的工藝、仍不因西藝敎育思想、而有何長足的進步</p>
<p>▲西政敎育思想　我國受了日本變法的反映以後、大家都知道西學中所包含的東西非常複雜、於是把藝能的一部份、名之曰西藝、風於政治的一部份、稱之曰西政、自從西藝西政一經分開之後、西政敎育、特别給國人們重視、因爲在變法之初、百端待舉、非政治人才中有糧　果敢的健將、差不多一切都難能舉辦、技藝項無從說起、可是西政敎育思想、爲時很短、不過自甲午到清末的十多年間罷了、　極方面、牠最大的影響、第一是西洋文化的　收、第二是中華民國的建立、所以西政敎育在實際上的影響、倒也的確很大、同時對於幾十年來、中國政治上社會十種種不良的現象、所負的責任也特别大、</p>

<h3>鞭</h3>
<p>— 賢賢</p>
<p>凡是瞧過海京伯馬戲，大概都忘不了那根可作示威用的降龍伏虎鞭。</p>
<p>野獸，無論馴服到如何程度，總脫不了野獸的習性。雖然肯賣力的野獸，儘肯替主人賣力，但有時也會發出獸性來，合主人搗蛋，不肯做戲。可是聽到主人把手裡的那根鞭兒，　發出一二聲，聽着汗毛會得站班的怪聲時，自會得俯首貼耳地聽從主人的指揮。</p>
<p>於是我對於　，便發生了一個極大的景仰。要維持秩序，少不了「鞭」。不只對於野獸，少不了鞭，就是人對人，也是如此，而更其是文明人對於野蠻民族。不過人對於野獸，用的是有形式的「鞭」，人對人在時候，用的是「鞭」的精神，或是超乎「鞭」的一種手段。</p>
<p>黑奴在白種人眼光中，便不　啻是馬戲班裏的野獸。要使黑人維持秩序，便該一鞭在手，否則黑人凖會發獸性而擾害白人的安寗，所以黑人雖已被解放了，「黑人」終與「白人」有别。</p>
<p>不只是黑人與白人有别。凡是世界上的有色人種，除了日本是例外，統該挨受幾下白色人種的鞭子。所以美國就發明了門羅主義，菲洲便給幾個歐洲大國瓜分了，亞洲的十分之六七，也在白人有超於「鞭」的手段，去對付由野獸而進化成的有色人種。</p>
<p>東亞和平之得以維持，自然不得不歸功於日本帝國的那一根鞭兒。不錯，在東亞，有一個從没發過威的大睡獅。這大睡獅若想睜一睜眼，爲了維持東亞和平起見，主子手裡的鞭，便會發出怪響來指揮它睡下去。個這幾天來，指揮睡獅的那根鞭，又有移作訓練歐洲大熊的模様。不知下一幕大馬戲，能否再在日内瓦賣一個滿座。</p>
<h3>犧牲者</h3>
<p>— 同初</p>
<p>今晨起來，還没有洗面，校役傳來一個消息：「對過壁脚上抛有一個私囝了」。私囝到底成怎様個模様？我爲好奇心衝動着，逕拉了一位同事奔去，雖則臉還没有洗。</p>
<p>在大都會内，這本不算什麽一回奇事；可是究竟是個囝，究竟是一種反常的舉動，丨抛掉親生的兒子。聚觀的已擁了一簇，我看見那「私囝」時，胸部受到猛烈壓迫，已打着大呼吸了。</p>
<p>紅色襁褓裏了他周身，在白毛氈中顯露出他的小臉；眼是閉着，嘴不見動，臉是緋紅的，不知他悲號後血液的緊張呢，還是所謂血囝的一種象徵。看的人不發一語，我只聽見舌與齒彈動的微聲：「札！札！札！札！」彌漫成可怖的空氣，乖戾的情景。在這情景下，給少有兩件事，値得我們注意的。</p>
<p>第一。婦女解放的要著，貞操在現在社會裏，仍是女子的第二生命。不然那私囝的母親，忍心抛棄他麽？婦女解放，要求自由平等，已高唱了好久，表面，一切都算達到目的了。但事實所給予我們的：除了少數外，誰不依附男子。惟其依附男子，於是有比種忍心心事。所以眞正的婦女解放，還需在經濟上謀得一個立足點。</p>
<p>第二。性生活的亟待謀妥善改進，一般人談此道的很少，似乎是不足齒的一回事。然事實俱在，尋花問柳之事，古今中外，不勝枚舉。法律的權威不能鎭壓他們，社會與輿論不能制服他們，丨丨給多的勝利，使他們的結晶物犧牲。咳丨那結晶物不是私人的東西呀，犧牲還是社會的。此後深望明理之士，加以研究，謀個妥善改進之法。</p>

<h3>哭挹舅</h3>
<p>— 瘦鷗</p>
<p>重陽後一日，有友自法租界來者，告我曰：「令舅父挹清先生殁矣！」余聞之，垂首無語。友復曰：「殁已月餘矣！子猶不知耶」？余仍無語，蓋亦不知應作何語也。良久，始對曰：「度因　居新遷，故未得報耳，然吾固已早知其必不願戀戀於此濁世矣，今聞君言，恰符所測殊不爲怪，第中心卒不免悒悒耳。」</p>
<p>挹舅姓吳氏，諱宗濂，挹清其字也。清季，曾出使義大利及英法諸國，爲吾國外交界之前輩，世人當不乏知之者。</p>
<p>惟吾舅除擅長英法文外，甚少今日一般外交家之風度，言語舉止，誠篤無比，儼然一鄉學究，以是曾宦游十數載，官至極品，而阮囊羞澀如故。然遇戚友乞助，每不惜自削膏火賣以濟之，及後家居不仕，有往呼將伯者，雖已無以應，仍力代設法，勞怨不辭。凡有懇任中保者，更立應不稍却，以是每被牽累，常與債爲人抵償，然事隔無多日，又爲第二人作中作保矣。余曾聞其言曰：「人非萬不已，斷不願不顧信譽，累及中保，彼於邀吾作保時，固未嘗蓄意欲累吾也，吾何能拒之！」其忠厚有如是。</p>
<p>舅且最喜作曹邱生，凡戚黨中有失業者，雖不往懇，亦必代爲出力。奈今之在位者多勢利，縱昔日與舅有深交，今則知其已失勢，故人之持挹舅函往謁當道者，結果十無一成，舅聞之，輒憤然大呼「人情薄於秋雲」不止。</p>
<p>年來，吾舅以太熱中故。代人賠累過鉅，經濟至窘，不肖者往往造作蜚言，多方揶揄，甚至當面予以難堪者，於是老人之隱痛日深，精神亦漸衰疲，今果不起矣！然壽已逾九十，此則天所以錫敦厚人，佼　者　日服參茸，必不克致也。</p>
<h3>中國人的心</h3>
<p>— 颜波光</p>
<p>記得在某西文雜誌上見到F'kiein著的「華人的心，」他說：「中國人的心和西人有顯然不同之點：（一）没有創造心，（二）存有徼倖心，（三）没有愛國心，（四）存有破壞心，」他說來，好似二隻眼睛帶上了Ｘ光鏡一般，洞見癥結。但是我們華人究竟有没有以上的心理呢？閱者不妨閉止想想！</p>
<p>（一）没有創造心：中國人的確是没創造心的，警如做生意的人，看見人家賣的生意好，自己立刻也做進種生意。人家文章做得好，他就立刻去模倣，或抄襲</p>
<p>（二）存有徼倖心：這個弱點我們可以肯定的說有的，像現在吸香烟可得奬金，用香皂可得奬金，……非但外國人利用我們這弱點！連華人自己也在利用自己丨弄得人人都成了一種不勞而獲的心理，眞是可嘆得很！</p>
<p>（三）没有愛國心：這倒不能一概而論，偌大一個中國，四萬萬五千萬的民衆總有許多人有愛國心的罷？不過看到仇貨的輸入，並不减少，可知没有愛國心的人一定很多丨所以今年雖是國貨年，國貨仍不能暢銷。</p>
<p>（四）存有破壞心：人家正在進行一樁事，他却在暗中搞鬼，或是人　粉刷了一垜雪雪白的墻垣，小孩子却去劃些痕跡，人家粘貼了一張墻招，破壞者却把它撕去，這就是存有破壞心，也就是没有道德心。</p>
<p>於是，我希望閱者見了我的文字，腦筋裏覺到我們中國人確有這種現象的，那末隨處勸化人家，倒也是一樁好事呢</p>
<h3>東北四連長</h3>
<p>— 張恨水</p>
<p>第十八回　脈脈傳茶含悲慰夫婦　怱怱出塞强笑别家人</p>
<p>他怕時候來不及，立刻出了哨子，將全連士兵，在院子裏集合，點過了名，見面前烏壓壓站着一連弟兄們，心裏這就想着，這些人都是要開到長城以外，去性命相拚，血肉相轉的，在一師人裏面，這算不得一回事，可是就各個人說，總是生平不能再大的一件事，難道還讓人家糊裏糊塗上道，不說上一聲兒嗎？可是想到自己當大兵的日子，在出發的時候營連長誰又曾提過一箇信兒，這要說，不是多事嗎？於是也就索興一個字也不提，站好了隊伍，就將弟兄們帶上營部集合，由營部再到大操塲集。合那東邊天上一輪金盆似的太陽，將金黃色的陽光，放到了操塲上來，照着趙自强這一團人半背了陽光站着。他們的團長，在遠的地方，不成理由的，說了幾句訓話，然後大聲問道；弟兄們吃飽了嗎？大家由丹田裏提出一口氣來答道吃飽啦？又問：喝足啦？又齊齊的答應喝足了。於是寳芳營長，親自出來喊着口令，向右轉，開步走。他們是第一營，當然是走在這一團的最前面。趙自强跟着隊伍，順了上海甸的大道，一步一步向前走。假使這不是跟了隊伍，他不知道這是向那裏去，也不知道走到了什麽地方。旅次行軍的隊伍，走的不是那様忙，弟兄們開着便步，高一脚低一脚的走着，有的兩三個人低聲說話，有的唱極低微的皮簧。趙自强他心裏一想，弟兄們都坦然的上道，爲什麽我這様喪魂失魄的呢。於是挺了胸脯子，直視着前面，也一步一步的走。（二四二）</p>
<p>世界珍聞</p>
<h3>意人提倡流行</h3>
<p>意大利年來亦聞恐慌，然而意大利工業家，服從慕索利尼的指導，不但愛用國貨，振興對外貿易，他們到巴黎爲世界業華的中心點，亦爲世界流行的發源地，因此意大利大都市中；米蘭，富羅蓮等地方的衣裝店，李力舉出新式主膿，竟把巴黎的投機家壓例，所以全世界的大富豪，都聞風而趨意大利了。</p>
<h3>法人的壽命</h3>
<p>近年法國人的壽命，漸漸延長。當大革命以來，平均壽命，祇有二十八歳九個月。到了一八○年，延長爲四十歳，一九○○年爲四十五歳九個月，一九一○年爲四十八歳大戰時雖没有正確的統計，然而從一九二○年至一九三二年間的平均年齡，單就巴黎而言，男爲五十二歳三個月，女爲五十六歳。當一九一一年住在巴黎的老人，年在八十歳以上者，不過一萬三千九百零一人，女的二倍。到了一九二六年，男子在八十歳以上的有一萬六千六百七十一人，女子增加二倍。去年度的統計，死亡之數，每千人爲一三·六萬，與一九○九年比較，非常减少。</p>
<h3>部長的女兒</h3>
<p>匈牙利財政部長哥蘭男爵的女兒勃蘭西爰，今年二十歳，因爲學習家政，到了蒲太彼司德舊王宫附近的咖啡店，學習做鷄蛋糕與氷淇淋的法子，每天學習六小時，一般人以爲部長的千金，還肯去尋職業，於是其他權貴的女兒，也都想到職業戰線去了。</p>
<h3>寒國人的壽命</h3>
<p>氣候寒冷的地方，人的壽命，照意大利統計局調查發表，那威人爲五十五歳三個月，瑞典人爲五十五歳，荷蘭人爲五十三歳，英國人爲五十歳五個月，比利時人爲四十七歳，法國人爲四十七歳，德國人爲四十六歳，意大利人爲四十四歳，奥大利人爲四十一歳，照這様看起來，那威爲歐洲最寒的國，其壽命最長，奥大利爲最熱的國，壽命最短，可知由寒而暖，壽命卽漸漸的减短了，</p>

<p>匈牙利的軍隊，爲全世界最喜喝酒的。每天差不多總要喝些土加酒，可是土加酒價錢很貴，終究不能盡量去買。陸軍總長龔波大將，聽到兵士没錢飽喝土加酒，因便提出二十四萬元資本，補助土加酒製造業者，令其改良酒質並减低酒價，對於兵十尤須特别廉價，因此匈牙利兵士，非常感激陸軍總長的好意，得以隨便狂飲了。</p>
<h3>獅子也要失業</h3>
<p>巴黎市當局，現在爲百隻獅子失業問題，無法應付。</p>
<p>這等獅子初時是參加德國人的馬戲團，巡察於歐洲各國的。後來馬戯團解散，那獅子送回巴黎，　　市當局想把這等獅子暫寄在動物園，可是動物園並没有養獅子的預算，又没有可以安置獅子的地位，拒絕寄存。現在百隻獅子弄得無法處置，不得已登報廉賣，聽說到現在，僱主實在不多。</p>

<h3>江南幣廣續鬆軟</h3>

<h3>證劵閩局醖釀中整六債劵降達一元九　丨其餘一致跌一元左右丨</h3>
<p>昨華商證劵交易所、市塲空氣、完全爲閩省政變消息所籠罩、消息愈混沌、人心益懷疑、空穴來風、謡言疊起、人氣更見虛軟、散戶多頭紛紛出籠、四號亦已停止吸收、市價頗有一蹶不振之勢、其實閩事尙在醖釀中、且聞内部亦未一致、中央本和平宗旨、從事調解、實際不若外間所傳之甚、或不難從事消滅、市價連小多日、計自宋財長去職後、迄未　回漲、足以行市已較前小去六七元之鉅、閩事若稍有轉機、反動之來、必亦甚劇、昨午開盤、市面稍見恍惚、市價因多空掉期、各有取捨之不同、略見參差、爲數亦祗二三角、而統鹽稅比較平穩、近期　略好五分、次盤大戶仍有賣出、加以多頭掉期、人心轉虛、大致均小去三五六角、而整六遠期獨小八角之多、本月期鹽稅祗小一角、市價稍見紊亂、午後五十八號賣出　湧、二十號及三十三號雖有買進、而多頭掉期尤猛、故開盤又一致傾跌、惟跌數多寡、相差頗多、如金短驟小一元有零、比關統稅祇小三四角、市面已居多空勢力競爭時期、收盤因晚報載胡有已經人閩之說、人心仍未見振作、整六又小七角、餘亦均小三五角、前途雖尙未可樂觀、惟或將小起回風也、市價結果、又跌落、元左右居多、惟整六跌一元六角至一元九角、成交總數、約計爲二千萬元以上、</p>
<h3>投機觀望中之紐約股市</h3>
<p>新豐洋行報告、十五日紐約股市、仍乏精彩、商情報告雖種良好、美金又見低峰、終因貨幣問題不清、投機家都作觀望、結果略疲、關於美財部變動、有數方面認爲係脫離　全貨幣政策之先聲、故美金當受不良影響、而間接則將提高物價、世界黃金猛漲至二十四元四角五分、而金融善後社之金價則仍爲三十三元五角六分、有人推測此乃政府行動之審愼、以免公債跌落而擾亂政府之信用云、全日成交一百三十三股又據稱鐵世紀報告、週初鋼鐵工作量爲百分之二十七·一、而現則降至百分之二十六、公共建築及汽車業等需要較低、惟各汽車公司在明年一二月以前不致再購、鐵路方面購貨大致亦將延至明年一月一日云、「小麥」買戶裹足不前、較昨小二分、跌時可買進「棉花」最近棉花之挺進、全爲美金疲軟、而各國美金跌　影響者、是滞將不再施報復手段、頗屬疑問、故財政部長之告休、雖有數方面加以通貨膨脹之解釋、而多頭仍宜審愼、金融善後社收買黃金每兩爲價格三三·五六元、兹將道瓊斯指數列後、</p>

<h3>糧食　廠存單薄標粉回漲</h3>
<p>昨粉市上午開盤後、各月份呈平穩堅俏之象、以洋麥報價芝加歌雖小六角左右、加拿大小一分左右、惟開盤後、人心仍然穩定、以洋麥雖有傾銷、目下則不能成爲事實、且以各廠之存底、自被北路諸帮搜　後、已不充實、所以外行人心、旣極堅定、業内外亦甚注意、并因内地廠家之補空、市氣遂步步見穩、迨至下午開盤、因上午之不小反大、人心愈堅、近期并因津帮之收買、開價愈好、遠期亦因抛售不多、亦呈挺象、觀後步局面、如存底之不豐、恐尙有好面也、結果本月份回漲三分七厘半、十二月份漲二分二厘半、一月份漲　分、二月份漲一分半、三月份漲一分二厘半、四月份漲一分半、</p>
<h3>期現麥都呈靜堅象</h3>
<p>昨日麥市、上下午開盤後、各月份呈近隱遠平之象、以洋麥報價、芝加哥小六角左右、加拿大小一角左右、不過市塲人心、以洋麥雖有續成、惟近期之國内到貨、旣見不　、此後之市情、自須爲之帶穩、所以交易雖未見暢、人心甚覺堅定、遠期因買戶不多、并因美滙之放長、人心終有顧慮、故市氣逾亦見寂也、現麥市面、仍然穩定、開瑶灣麥四元零七分、高郵麥三元九角半、姜堰麥四元零四分、計二千四百包、由福新辦去</p>
<h3>白粳回跌角許</h3>
<p>（滬南）來源四十餘號、貨約五千石、本街店胃較前稍遜、僅計二千餘石、形勢轉懈、市况平疲、雖售方極度喊高、將以人心平庸、無濟大局、常帮蘇同南港等粳、行情垂軟近角、杜尖亦疲數分、僅羊尖以貨乏尙能站定、至於包胃續有二三千包、而以積体來源尙夥、故去路雖旺、仍有過求之感、因之市况難免影響下落、幸售方扳緊、祇略修數分耳、隂元酒戶頗動、市色續挺、變元無甚軒輊、</p>
<p>（滬北）各路到貨五十一二號、市上銷胃續淡、近日市形、恒在盤旋之局、各貨市價不相上下、惟新變元到有消滯、價小一角、</p>
<h3>甬帮辦裝糙客秈　丨客元步小半元以上丨</h3>
<p>昨日客秈市况、愈形清淡、閩帮辦胃更呆、本街囤戶亦多觀望、而到頭不絕、存底漸漸復充、然貨主以産地有客帮直接辦裝、成本昂大、亦不貴過於賤價脫手、因此行情尙能平站、尙未與銷化同趨下游也、昨日客秈只有泉州辦去江西機晚一百包、價七十八角、其他均無交易、後有寗波帮趁小辦成沙市糙米五百包、價五元三角半至五元三角、此米裝去如能通銷、則尙有繼續辦裝之望、本街成交江西機元米一百二十包、價七元七角半、貨雖較次、然比之上月底已跌小半元以上、北帮亦試辦蕪湖機元六十八包、價八元半云、</p>
<h3>九江黑蔴跌勢已定</h3>
<p>九江黑芝蔴自新貨登塲以來、市况一味下遊、良以今庚年境豐稔、而銷化則减少、首批售價開十元、二批卽跌至九元半、依次頓跌至八元三角、中途一度好起三角、開八元六角、以後則步步下跌、至昨市、跌勢稍見立定、因其來源亦已見少、存底約有千包左右、昨由甬帮及本街辦去六百六十餘包、一價開七元四角至七元三角半、一銷旺存薄、人心轉定矣、</p>
<h3>糖市　绵白呌升未成盤</h3>
<p>昨日糖市以關金略升、但銷胃未動、趨勢依然平疲、公會劃盤二四粗砂白普通貨呌二十元三角、二十号中砂白十九元八角、八九號赤高莊十六元、普通十五元七角、均乏成交、中華一號綿白呌升五分、爲十九元○五分、亦未開出、潮青零星略有開價、爲十五元四角、又十四元七角至十四元二角、建帮開出高統手冰數十箱、每砠價爲十七元四角、太古糖Ｂ嘜二十元六角、</p>
<h3>油市　柏油浙東西疊報漲風</h3>
<p>柏油浙西正値新貨上市之際、不料柏子價格頓起漲風、上週子價客盤尚祗每石五元五六角、乃近日適在各榨坊開榨、收價竟增至六元以上致成本增高、前幾日内地曾有客家到申售開本車皮油二百餘件、價格每扣二十元○二角送到、旋因子價驟增、故此價已無人肯售、若照現市而衡、恐在二十一元之外、惟漢市尙無變動、而浙東金蘭一帶、亦已見漲、所以南北市情、漸趨異途、本埠行家因出新之時、存本薄、先見南油價尚合算、今旣疊報漲風、恐又欲轉移目光於漢油矣、</p>
<h3>五金　本釘出路轉暢</h3>
<p>本廠元釘、（市上簡稱本釘）近來生意又見暢盛、蓋客帮若長江路一帶以及寗波·福州·温州諸埠、均有購配、而本街建築帮、油蔚作以及玻璃店等、亦莫不有成交、故前昨二日、統計開出三四千桶、其價後桶（一百磅天平秤）倍司爲七元二角、比之舶來品要便宜四五角不等、聞連日原料來貨甚少、人心良挺、行情頗有激增之勢、</p>
<h3>絲花　華絲走销已成弩末</h3>

<h3>青年與老子</h3>
<p>— 一尊</p>
<p>聽說，「慨自歐風東漸以來」，中國的道德就變壞了，尤其是近時的青年，往往看不起老子。這恐怕眞是一個大錯誤，因爲我看了幾個例子，覺得老子的對於青年，有時確也很有用處，很有益處，不僅足爲「文學修養」之助的。</p>
<p>有一篇舊文章丨丨我忘了出於什麽書裏了丨丨告訴我們，曾有一個道士，有長生不老之術，自說已經百餘歳了，看去却「美如冠玉」，像二十左右一様。有一天，這位活神仙正在大宴闊客，突然來了一個鬚髮都白的老頭子，向他要錢用，他把他駡出去了。大家正驚疑間，那活神仙慨然的說道，「那是我的小兒，他不聽我的話，不肯修道，現在你們看，不到六十，就老得那麽不成様子了。」大家自然是很感動的，但到後來，終於知道了那人其實倒是道士的老子。</p>
<p>還有一篇新文章告訴我們，他是一個有志之士，學說是很正確的，不但講空話，而且去實行，但待到看見有些地方的老頭兒苦得不像様，就想起自己的老子來，即使他的理想實現了，也不不能使他的父親做老太爺，仍舊要喫苦，於是得到了更正確的學說，抛去原有的理想，改做孝子了。假使父母早死，學說那有這麽圓滿而堂皇呢？這不也就是老子對於青年的益處麽？</p>
<p>那麽，早已死了老子的青年不是就没法？我以爲不然，也有法子想。這還是要查舊書。另有一篇文章丨丨我也忘了出在什麽書裏了丨丨告訴我們，一個老女人在討飯，忽然來了一位大闊人，說她是自己的久經失散了的母親，她也將錯就錯，做了老太太。後來她的兒子要嫁女兒，和老太太同到首飾店去買金器，將老太太已經看中意的東西自己帶去給太太看一看，一面請老太太還在揀，丨丨可是，他從此就不見了。</p>
<p>不過，這還是學那道士似的，必須實物時候的辦法，如果單是做做自白之類，那是實在有無老子，倒並没有什麽大關係的。先前有人提倡過「虛君共和」，現在又何妨有「没親孝子」？張宗昌很尊孔，恐怕他府上也未必有「四書」「五經」罷。</p>
<h3>觀菊偶感</h3>
<p>— 穆木天</p>
<p>獨在異鄉爲異客　每逢佳節倍思親</p>
<p>遥知兄弟登高處　遍挿茱萸少一人</p>
<p>這是唐代詩人王維的七言絕句。這四句詩，何人不知，何人不曉呢？寫出來，我想總會有明公說我「倒糞」。可是，今天，對着這四句詩，我却起了很大的懷戀。</p>
<p>我没有作過好的兒子。我也没有過好的哥哥。雖然我的心是好的，可是，他們總是不大曉得。不但對於自己的家族，我一向是冷淡，而且對於我的家鄉也是不大關心的。我覺得人生最好是飄泊。在異鄉過着飄泊生活，好過在家鄉作無聊的「嘔氣」。在異鄉討飯吃，好過在家鄉作地主老爺。雖然現在國亡家破，可是都市的小布爾喬亞的生活，我還是覺得有意思。</p>
<p>自從回到了中國，是一天一天地離開了咖啡店生活了。當年的感傷的悲哀的情緒，在我心中也斷根了。也許是老了些啦。「油鹽柴米，」使我漸漸接近現實，使我知道悲哀憂鬱都是没有用處的。喝咖啡幹嗎？吃酒幹嗎？雖然不該走入文字的路途，可是「旣來之，則安之」罷。雖然是「半瓶醋」，可是多多少少會有點用。「作一天和尙撞一天鐘」罷。没有「和尙」，「秃子」也可超度一下亡魂罷。</p>
<p>近來的心理，是想安安分分地作人的，可是今天，居然「人心大變」了。到學校裏，看見到處擺着菊花，心裏起了說不出怎様的難過。好像那一棵菊花，都是塗着血似的。前幾天，看見各處的「菊花大會」等等消息，本來没有什麽，可是，今天心裏是說不出的難過哩。我懷念起在帝國主義的鐵蹄下的東北，我不禁回憶起王維的那句詩來。</p>
<p>東北現在怎麽様了？在那種水深火熱之中，東北的民衆是怎様地在生活着呢？我倒並不是思親，而是想起那些走投無路的勤苦的農民們。而在中原恐怕還有人在若無其事地欣賞菊花呢？我不禁想起「惟寗靜可以致遠」那句話來。同時，我更想起「空城計」來。大概「空城計」，」是中國人的拿手好戲罷。可是，現在，帝國主義者怕没有了司馬懿那様身先士卒的元帥，（告訴列位明公，這我是從戲台上看來的，）所以「空城計」怕終不會使他害怕的。放兩砲試試看。這又怎辦呢？</p>
<p>「紅樓夢」治國，「金瓶梅」賣家。」據說，這是滿洲天子的秘訣。「水滸傳」，「三國演義」，是頂好兵書。特别地是一齣「空城計，」就不知被某少帥用了多少次了，某少帥不但是善唱，「空城計」，而且還是一反乃父的窮兵黷武之故轍，接受了託爾斯泰的不抵抗主義。而且，是徹底地奉行着的。記得先年，日本某報紙上提出他來作諾貝爾賞金平和奬的候補者。今年的諾貝爾平和賞金是不是有他老人家的名字，我可不知道。不過，今天，我由菊花想到「空城計」，由「空城計一想到了某少師罷了。</p>
<p>「抽刀斷水水更流，舉杯消愁愁更愁」，越看菊花，我的心是越法地難受。所以想到王維這四句詩來。今天，我感到這四句詩是深有意義的。這是已往所未曾體會到的。</p>
<p>冩到這裏，我憶起數年前在大連市看過菊花大會。現在，大連恐怕還有更盛大的菊花大會罷。接着，又想起前幾天，在一本畫報上，看見了「滿洲國」「新京」的計劃圖，也是非常難過，好像在那裏滿滿地塗着「滿洲」民衆的血。可是今天的心情，是同那天彷彿的。</p>
<p>但現在「滿洲」的武裝民衆，還在那裏積極的抗日吧。也許只有他們自己能救，自己罷。</p>
<h3>澉浦通信（完）</h3>
<p>— 阿英</p>
<p>□□兄</p>
<p>祗要到過澉浦的人，大概是没有不知道「南北湖」的。「南北湖」本名「永安湖」，離西城約五里路的光景。這湖的形式，和「西湖」一様，分爲南北，中間隔着一道長堤，有亭有橋，兩旁更有那疏疏的高大的「行道柳。」羣山環抱，獨缺其南，南爲大海，海水清淺。一據吳俠虎先生的澉浦　」一書所載，湖的界園有十二里，共三千七百多畝，灌田八千多畝。因爲它和「西湖」相像，普通又稱做「小西湖。」不過，兩湖相較，「小西湖」究不如「西湖」的秀麗，且眞的不免是「小」，使人的胸褾，不能如在「西湖」上所得到的那様開闊。但這兒也有和「西湖」不同的地方，那就是在三面山上，有不盡的高大的樹林，靠着湖，有廣大的　田，無邊的海：這都是在「西湖」上所不能找到的。這些景物，如果想一眼收，也並不難，祗要你爬到「　　須　　　你　可以　　　　　不　的九吉九峯，就可以看見西湖的全景：特殊是那月牙形連接着的賣田，成千成萬的工作者，你肯接近它，你將獲得很多的經騐，很好的敎育。問題是，　我新知，來此地的人，是游湖的多，來考察鹽區生活的少，至於要了解鹽民苦痛，那是更不必談了。</p>
<p>就在這湖的北面山上，我住了將近一個月，照例的清晨乘船　過兩湖到鹽區，黃昏時再打槳歸來。湖上的生涯，當然有許多可記的，如月夜的湖山，如採　的趣事，如暴風雨中的歸途，如對變幻的湖光山道而引起的一些暝想，但使中的清趣，並非我來此地的主旨，我是不想一一的涉及了。可是，究竟也有不能使我忘懷的，其一，就是湖上的兒女，竟因我們短期的生活接近，使他們非常動摇，非常的追慕都會，無論在什麽地方，都可以看得出來。都會影響農村，這是必然的，而少女們，眞是特殊的厲害。我覺得這現象，是把古老沉靜的一小「西湖」空氣弄得非常的不穩定，在這裏，我感到喜悅，我看到她們心理是如何的逐步演變，表情如何一步一步的走向緊張。這幅極少清晰的必然的圖畫，使我能很深刻的看到，我應該聲明，主要的是由於同來的幾位女性的影響所致。其次，就是在第三次離開此地的前夜了。那一夜爲着紀念我們大部工作的完畢，大部分人爲　次不會再來，而又値月白風清，湖光山色特殊的　人，我們便雇了四隻小舟，並行於兩湖之中，蕩漾於微波之上，作一回清快的湖　。不知什麽原故，在笑語秋唱，幽咽的洞簫聲中，竟使想起了一首舊詞，那詞的全文是：「月夜午橋橋上飲，座中都是豪英，小溪流月去無聲。杏花疏影裏，吹笛到天明，二十年來如一　，此身雖在堪驚，閒登小閣看新晴。古今多少事，漁唱起三更。」低低的吟着這首詞，居然忍不住的悲從中來，覺得今日的勝遊，其結果，不過是增加來日的悲痛而已，自己竟陷於沉默的境地。然而，再發展的想，想到陸放翁，吳汝淪等古今詞人的寫的類此的詩文，更想到他們爲什麽不能從社會的發展上看，來認取生長的歡快，祇是注意於個人的聚散離合，對於自己適間的哀感，又竟忍不住的有些啞然了。這一夜，在湖中遊了兩小時，使「西海頭」的鹽民全部驚奇的從睡夢中吵醒，跑到湖岸邊來看，在他們，以爲我們是不啻生活於仙境之中，那知道，我們雖然有這片時的歡快，但爲着生存而奮鬥的苦惱，和他們是並没有什麽兩様呢？</p>
<p>○○兄，澉浦的生活，在通信裏，我所能告訴你的，是止於此了。還有許多可寳貴的材料，可寳貴的生活經騐，祗好等將來有機會再寫出來吧。</p>
<h3>兩兄弟　（三十一）</h3>
<p>— 莫泊桑著　李維克譯</p>
<p>他低下頭，又吃着東西。</p>
<p>他並不餓，他覺得什麽都没味。他急於要走，要離開他們的談話和玩笑。</p>
<p>可是羅蘭老爹現在又被酒香摇動了，又忘記了兒子的忠告，他斜睨着放在他碟旁的一瓶差不多還是滿的一瓶香檳酒。他不敢碰它，怕又受到新的責備，他便想以一種狡猾，巧妙的手段拿到酒瓶而不至引起筆爾注意。他想得了一個詭計，一個最尋常的詭計：他滿不在乎的拿起酒瓶，托着瓶底，伸　長手臂越過桌子把筆爾面前的空杯斟滿；隨後他又輪着給其餘的人斟了，當輪到他自己面前時，他大聲說着話，雖然斟了一點在他自己的杯裏，但别人看是一定說說那是偶然没有習心的緣故。並且什麽人都没有注意着這事。</p>
<p>筆爾無心地喝了很多。性情焦燥而又有着滿腹牢騷的他，時時不意地拿着高脚酒杯，凑上嘴唇，隔着玻璃，我們可見瞧見許多小汽泡在那生動透明的液體裏飛跑着。他於是把這液體慢慢地傾入口中，以便感着這散在舌頭上的氣體給他以含有甜味的小小的刺痛。</p>
<p>慢慢地，一種柔和的熱充滿了他的身體。這熱從肚子丨丨肚子像是這種熱的爐　丨丨裏出發，傳到了胸口，占領四肢，散佈在所有的肉裏，好像一種温和且有益的帶來了快樂的波浪一様。他現在覺得稍爲舒服了一點，没有先前那様焦燥了，没有先前那様不滿了；連今晚要和他的弟弟去談那件事的决心也鬆下來了，這並不是他有意就此罷休，而是爲着不那麽快去擾亂自己感着的幸福。</p>
<p>博齊汝站了起來請大家共祝一杯。</p>
<p>他向大家鞠了一躬之後，說道！</p>
<p>「諸位非常優雅的太太，諸位貴人；我們今天共叙一堂是慶祝我們的一位朋友所遭逢的一樁喜事的。從前人家說財當是盲目的，我則以爲牠僅僅有點近視或狡猾罷了，現在它果然使得珍珠號船長，我們忠實的夥伴羅蘭的兒子在哈佛港顯赫起來了。」</p>
<p>演說完後便鑒着一陣呌好與鼓掌的聲音；羅蘭老爹站起來作答。</p>
<p>他斆是喉嚨裏有一點窒塞，舌子也不大靈活，咳嗽一會之後，吃吃地說道：</p>
<p>「謝謝，船長，我以我自己和我兒子的義謝謝你。你的好意我永遠不會忘記。我敬答一杯，」</p>
<p>他的眼睛和鼻孔裏都充滿着涙水，他坐下來，他再没什麽話說了。</p>
<p>現在輪着那在嘻嘻笑着的哲安來說話了；</p>
<p>「我應當在這裏道謝諸位忠誠的，高雅的朋友（他瞧着陸太太），道謝諸位今天給我這動人的友情的表證。可是這並不是幾句話便可以表出我對於諸位的感謝的。我以後，在我一生的任何時節，都要向諸位表示我的謝意，因爲我們的友情不是那種一瞬卽過的友情啊。」</p>
<p>他的母親非常感動着，低低說道：</p>
<p>「好極了，我的孩子。」</p>
<p>但是博齊汝呌道：</p>
<p>「來罷，陸太太，你來代女性一方面說幾句話罷。」</p>
<p>她舉起酒杯，以一種親幼而微含凄戚的聲音說：</p>
<p>「我呢，我舉一杯爲瑪賴沙先生在天之靈祝福。」</p>

<h3>走狗考</h3>
<p>— 弗拔</p>
<p>論狗的八字，生來就不見得大佳。說文狗下，引孔子曰：『狗，叩也，叩氣呔以守。』我們從『叩也』兩字，就會想到一付摇尾乞憐狀態，覺得不大英勇。再從爾雅：『犬，未成豪狗』一條看起來，則狗也者，原不過是犬頰中之小焉者而已。直譯起來，就是「小犬」，這在人們的感想中尤覺卑卑不足道，即放在動物學大辭典裏，也不見得佔有多高的位置。</p>
<p>然而時至今日，這渺焉小者的狗，居然大走其紅運，似乎民國二十一交了「戍運」似的。於是頌人則曰「走狗」，睹傅則有跑狗，而北平公安局長亦應「運」而下禁止女子畜狗之令，最近上海上海好事之徒，則更有「打狗團」的組織，其爲好，惡，捧，打，雖有不同，重視斯狗則一。嗚呼，狗運可謂亨通矣！</p>
<p>考古代對於狗的分類，大别爲三種；禮疏：『犬有三種：一曰守犬，守　宅舍者也；二日田犬，田獵所用也；三曰食犬，充庖廚庶羞用也。』其第一種，即前所謂『叩氣吠以守』的一種，現代闊人門房中養的德國警犬是也。第二種即今日馬路上所見身肥體壯，口套鐵絲罩，或携於西人之手，或徘徊於道左，或昻然高坐於福特汽車中的獵犬是也。至第三種，在昔嘗爲長腿將軍所珍嗜，而今滬上廣東食館時或有一臠出售，名曰「戍腿」者是也。這裏的獨没有「走狗」的名詞。走狗一名，始見於晏子春秋。晏子春秋諫下篇載：『景公走狗死，公令外供之棺，内給之祭，晏子聞之諫……』走狗兩字，始見於著錄。按景公身爲一國元首，非長腿將軍可比，其所畜之狗，當非充庖廚庶羞的食狗，而爲現代西洋式的叭兒狗無疑。這就牠死後的風光看來丨棺與祭丨可知。嗚呼，是亦狗傑也哉！</p>
<p>其後越大夫范蠡遺文種書，有『飛烏盡，良弓藏，狡兎死，走狗烹』之語，見於太史公所著的史記，是爲走狗兩字著錄於正史之始，野史則戰國策上亦曾一見，俱爲田犬的代名。蓋田犬之所以得人寵愛，就在牠介乎人與獸兩者之間，能爲主人效力，但身分的不明，也在於此。說牠是獸吧，牠却帮着人殘殺同類；說牠是人呢，牠又變不過那一付本來的嘴臉來。看似無能，牠却會追兎逐鹿，出過小小風頭；說牠有能，那麽也不該這麽柔順地順人指揮而以得到一點賸餘的恩賚，便昂然自足了。總之是得難斷定的，這且不表。</p>
<p>大概魏晋以前，走狗一詞，尙未十分通行；自魏晋以後，經文人的咏歌，於是走狗便滿天下了。</p>
<p>頌狗文章，最早的當推晋朝的博玄。他做有走狗賦，其警句有云：『蓋輕迅者莫如鷹，猛捷者莫如虎，惟良犬之禀性，兼兼　之勁武。尋漏跡，躡遺蹤，疾如騰波，勢若駭龍。陵　越　，巒山超谷，原無　兎，林無　鹿。旣迅捷其無前，又閑暇而有度。』洋洋數千言，可謂盡頌之能事。此類文章，後世多有，故不具錄。</p>
<p>至人以走狗爲名，或說漢時已有之，實則確屬可考的當始自清代的鄭板橋。牛應之雨窗消意錄載：『鄭板橋最愛徐青藤詩，嘗刻一私印云「徐青藤門下走狗鄭爕」。』此亦銜頭中之别開生面者，嗚呼，鄭氏於狗，可謂深喜之矣。自是而後，人狗因緣益不可分矣。降至近世，以附庸風雅而甘列走狗的，大有人在。稱頌人的也多曰「走狗」。蓋已凡有井水飲處，無不能用「走狗」一名詞矣。恐人之數典忘祖，作走狗考。</p>

<h3>戀的一幕</h3>
<p>— 光漢</p>
<p>傍晚。在××大學圖書館内。四圍異常寂靜。窗外不斷地吹進來一絲絲秋的凉意。幾個學生埋着頭在各做各的事。</p>
<p>他和她獨据室隅的一桌，對坐着，各人翻開書，披着紙，拿起筆在寫。</p>
<p>忽然，他向她使個眼色，把一張寫好了的紙條送過去。她接去一看，不說什麽，也寫一張送過來。他看了，又寫一張送過去。</p>
<p>他和她四目相觸，笑了。</p>
<p>他又寫一張送過去，她又寫一張送過來。</p>
<p>他不覺眉頭一蹙，趕快又寫一張送過去。</p>
<p>她把紙條撕碎，擲在桌下。他急忙俯身下去拾起來，搓成團，緊握着。</p>
<p>他向她望一望，又寫一張送過去。</p>
<p>她只在那紙條上用筆畫幾畫。</p>
<p>他臉上突現出苦悶的神色，擱下筆，伸個懶腰，長吁了一聲。</p>
<p>她有些難過的様子，又寫一張送過來。接着便是媚人的笑。</p>
<p>他一看，頓時愁眉殿開了，點一點頭，思索一會，又寫一張送過去。他把眼朝外望。</p>
<p>「不成！」她不覺發出聲音來。室内的空氣，被這清脆的聲音驚破，幾個在看書的學生，不約而同的抬起頭來，但一會兒又低下去，在各做各的事。她有些慌了，臉上泛着紅霞，伸出尖的舌頭，向他釘了一眼。</p>
<p>他極力把自己壓鎭靜，又寫一張送過去。</p>
<p>她摇摇頭，又寫一張送過來。</p>
<p>他看了。表示不滿意的態度，立刻又寫一張送過去。</p>
<p>她沉思了好久，像很爲難似的。</p>
<p>他和她暫時默然了。一切也愈顯寂靜。</p>
<p>他突然輕輕地握着她的一隻手，做出央求似的表情。她有些害怕的様子，半推半就，頭只管左顧右盼。</p>
<p>她把手縮回去，又寫一張送過來。驚人的手腕</p>
<p>他笑了，向她痴痴地望。她含羞似的低下頭。</p>
<p>他做個手勢，他和她便將畫筆收拾好，又把那些紙條撕碎，散在地板上，一同走了。</p>
<p>天漸黑了，四圍仍然寂靜。看書的也少了。</p>
<p>在一片碎紙上，潦草地寫着這麽幾個字：「好！答應你吧，×哥丨」</p>

<h3>星期二</h3>
<p>— 餘生</p>
<p>星期三，照例是日監獄探望犯人的日子。宿在亭子間中的蓮仙，在頭天晚上就凄凉的計劃着：棉衣是不可少的，天氣是這様的異常寒冷，大雪又猛烈地下烈，北風像刀一般地刮在人的臉上發生透骨的戰慄。她想着囚在人間地獄中的丈夫，心是碎了呵！</p>
<p>她徘徊在街頭，買好一套棉衣，還買了個裝菜的盒子。回到矮小的樓中，獨自繼續她忙亂着，把凖備好了的爐火燃起，料理着鹹而耐的蔬菜；同時修補着已破舊的襪子，内心還在温柔的祈禱着。默想着經過親手補綴的東西，穿在他的身上，也可以等於自己他身邊一様，或者能給與他一點安慰！還想寫封短信，夾在衣服裏送進去，並附上兩塊錢，怕的有時需要零用。</p>
<p>當她開始凖備着寫信的時候，思想突然的停頓了，喉頭緊塞着，酸楚的涙珠，一點點地往紙上淌滴着。天啦！寫些什麽好呢？她沉思許久，終于噙着眼涙開始寫下去了：『哥哥丨我來了，四天未接來信我就來了。聽說你被扳下獄，我的心靈，是多麽出乎意外地痛楚呵丨事已至此，無法挽回了，目前我只希望着你，保重，保重，第三個保重！我日夜在祈禱着的，要是天不負我們，總有重見天日的希望，一切都忍受着吧，哥哥丨送來棉被兩條，棉衣一套，舊襪兩雙，是我親手補綴的，每一行線，都連串着你妹妹情不自禁的淚珠在。還有小菜一盒，牙粉牙刷肥皂各一件，小手巾兩方，外錢二元，留在身邊零用吧。不要躭心我，我的身體是自由而健康的呵！蓮妹』</p>
<p>在一切預備好了後，她沉進默想中了，她幻想着將來丈夫歸來時的幸福，她將怎様比過去更像生命般地寳貴着，熱戀着他！但是，再一想他現在處的危險，她又胆寒了，希望在她腦海中，急連地减到最低點了。她又想到：判個無期徒刑也好，只要保留着生命丨各種幻想，希望，和恐懼，在這一夜擾亂，揉搓着她整個的靈魂，她一夜不曾合上眼睛。</p>
<p>雪是愈下愈大了，寒風不時的刺進她的衣内，收拾好應帶了東西，重復緊裹着那隆然的腹部。因爲由她的寓所到“黑色恐怖”</p>
<p>監獄，有遥遠的道路上的奔波，她肧着快要臨産的身妊，這種保護是必要的。</p>
<p>車在凸凹泥濘的道上急馳着，荒凉的四野，不曾見有行人，在狂風怒雪中，只有她和車夫是人類中的不幸者，呵！那無邊的愁苦，好像都負在她的心頭和車夫的肩上丨，在她那如火似箭的心中，這時什麽也來不及，想，只急於要到達那殘酷的目的地。</p>
<p>她低頭走進虎口般的獄門，在一個小窗口掛了號，回到靠左邊的角下，倚着行李坐在冷濕的地上等着。一個個水坑向她吐着刺骨的寒氣，許多被軋斷脚手的囚徒，牽去審同時經過她的面前，憔悴的面容，痛苦的内心，叮噹的鐐聲，一下一下地敲碎她整個的心丨她想着自己文弱的丈夫，怎様受得了這般的拆磨？她的心寒了，身體戰慄着，兩手緊抓着心口！</p>
<p>兵士拿着呌號單出來了，她馬上不顧一切的擠上前去，『王××，李××！』『陳仲虛，不凖會！』操着生殺之權的兵士驕傲而像有氣似地這様呌着。『不凖會麽？東西可不可以送進去？』『不凖會東西當然不能拿進去。』她失望了，簡直像在懸崖上倒跌在深不見底的山澗裏！最後她哀求一個慈祥的老兵，他答應帮她去探聽，經過一懇求之後，東西也不可以瞞着拿進去。她像得救了似了，耐心地等在外面。</p>
<p>行李又搬出來了，老年的兵士也面帶愁容！她像見到魔鬼似的，懼怕的毛髮悚然而戰慄着！急促的問着：『怎麽了』『昨天已解去××了，恨我無法帮助你！』『眞的麽？解到××去不會有危險吧？』她睜大了眼珠問。「老實告訴你罷，昨天夜裏已經秘密的打了靶！還不只他一個呢。』突來的消息，對於她眞是個晴天的霹靂，她被震昏了！一切都歸幻滅，最後的希望也被斷貨，她的呼吸停止了，倒在小溏邊的榻樹下。大風仍是怒𡀱着，雪花片打在她慘白的臉上。</p>
<p>在這殘酷的人世間，她從此成爲一個愛情的受傷者了。</p>
<h3>再論花瓶與花瓶架子</h3>
<p>— 敬嘉</p>
<p>自從寫了那篇花瓶與花瓶架子的檢討之後，本把這一件事丢開了。昨兒又拜讀了一篇華女士的：讀後，又不得不打起精神來寫一些。這雖然不像文選與莊子那様會閙得；天翻地覆，日月無光；但，至少，這總是一個有；趣味；的問題吧？</p>
<p>所謂：花瓶也者，據說是；因爲好看，作裝飾品，而無實用的。旣以花瓶之稱加諸女職員之身，那末不用說，女職員是：裝品而無實用的了。當然，我絕對不能說花瓶是一個没有梅辱；成分的名詞。但是，女士們想出了花瓶架子的名詞加諸男女之身，是否能把花瓶的侮辱驅除了呢？這種阿Q式的精神勝利是否一個正當的報復呢？</p>
<p>華女士承認了女職員中有；假金混着，換一句話說，華女士是承認了女職員中有；花瓶混着。我們知道，一個爛蘋果可以把一籃的好蘋菓都弄壞了，一點墨跡就可以把一疋白布弄得没精彩。爲了幾個人的萎弱，我們就被譏爲東亞病夫。我們都知道要刷除侮辱先得從自已身上幹起，誰能說在日本佔領了東四省之後破口大駡幾聲，東洋矮鬼；就可以洗清了我們的侮辱？</p>
<p>想出花瓶這個名詞的人，誠然，我相信他正在鼓舞欲狂，受人稱譽。因爲他所想出的這個名詞已經得到了事實的證明了。當然，一個人的思想能得大衆的附和是很足歡樂的。我想華女士一定也很歡樂吧？假如花瓶架子的名稱能如華女士之願像花瓶一様地普遍的傳揚着的話，華女士還不該舉起高脚杯洗一大白嗎？華女士旣然知道想出花瓶這名詞的人一些都不會難堪，那末華女士還不該爲花瓶架子的稱呼大樂特樂嗎？</p>
<p>摩登男職員甘心匍伏於摩登女職員的脚下以待候她們的確不在少數。但是，我相信摩登男職員一定不會匍伏在鄉下大姑娘之前的！一只孔雀看見穿得花花綠綠一塊紅一塊白的人也會開屏的。没有花瓶，花挿到那兒去？架子放到那裏去？</p>
<p>假如，花瓶架子的稱呼能如華女士的願生普遍得像花瓶一様的話，非但女士們要感謝她爲女士洗刷，就是男士如我也要匍伏在華女士的旗袍角下三跪九叩首的感謝不盡的。老實說吧，女士始終比男女幸運一些的。女職員還能做一個美的陳設品，而男士連陳設品都做不到。在機關中，上司絕對不會當面駡女職員，至多在背後說幾聲；花瓶總是花瓶而已，可是男士却要被上司當着面駡幾聲；聲飯桶丨至少，花瓶總比飯桶來得好一些吧？飯桶；的名詞中一些；侮尋都没有麽？假使華女士能夠把男士從；飯桶；提拔到；花瓶架子；的話，還不夠我感謝嗎？</p>
<p>如果要講到男女平權的話，我眞不知道怎様說才好。自從申報上有了自我職業介紹之後，有人統計過十分之九的回音是被女士佔據了的，女子職業的萌芽是男子職業的凋零！誰能否認了呢？</p>
<p>如果華女士以爲有了花瓶架子的稱呼之後感到相當的滿意和安慰，那我就祝她永久地那様滿足了罷！</p>

<h3>學生的悲哀</h3>
<p>— 祖</p>
<p>日子這様快過去，又是到了十一月底初頭了。今春因了某種關係，綴學在家自修，啊！整整的一年就是如此這般地快要混完了！所謂自修，自修的成績在那裏呢，還記得在學校的時候，國文先生在作文課裏出一個題目呌我們做：「自修之重要」，「求學貴於自修論」，話是這様說，可是要實行又是怎様的困難不易啊！那時，我們都是這様說（就是現在，還是有許多人這様說：「學校生活太呆板，學校與社會實際距離得太遠太遠了！」旣然如此，那末，認識了這一缺陷的覺悟學生離開了學校，該是應當如何奮發地熱烈地以社會做學校而來開始學那合乎社會應用的實際學問了。然而談何容易呀！這個迷亂矛盾，一切都呈現不安定現象的社會，它給予我們一般青年的，可簡直是殘酷地榨壓得呌我們快要窒息而死，那裏還能有給我們自修的機會呢？</p>
<p>爲了年齡的關係，雖然環境與我的理想是絕對的矛盾，但，唯其是矛盾，所以我們然只有想怒力地自修一下，而去考上幾級，但是首先對我棒喝着示威的就是「文憑」這鬼東西。我無法撈獲到這東西，我就跳不過這道嚴厲在檢查着的困難的鬼門關。我着這鬼東西，當然使我感覺到極度的悲哀！不過，同時，我又回想起了過去，又使我對於學校重復逗起了很大的懷疑！一幕一幕的滑稽把戲，還清清楚楚地映在我的記憶上：大約是在初中三年級的那年吧，「先生」上課都很馬虎，我們學生，年齡還小，知道些什麽，「先生」馬虎，我樂得「寫意」，在「先生」未來上課以前，我們在黑板上，就大書特書地寫着「隨便談談」，「先生」是最聽我們的話的，所以那時他亦是我們心目中怪可愛的人了。於是在上課時間，大家就隨意談起來了。這様過去逢到月考，祗要我們大家說句「寫不出」，「先生」就在黑板上做給我們看了，他們便照抄了事，大家都得到九十一百的考分；再不然，或是先生比較嚴緊些，就千方百計向印考卷的校役運動，或考了以後，到「先生」處去偷來修改，或大家Ｐass或把重要的預先抄在小紙條上和課桌上…………等的把戲是盡能盡量的玩着。這様的在學校裏鬼混着，結果得到了虛僞的成績單。現在呢心中覺得非常的空泛。這様想着，我的腦經裏，又起了波浪了；我想，即使能夠入了大學念書，最大的疑間仍舊潛服在我的心内的：大學畢了業，一定能夠成就我的志願麽？一定能解决我的生活問題麽？事實的答覆：大學畢業，留學回國而失業的多着呢？</p>
<p>啊：種種藴藏在心頭的事情都使人煩愁：過去入了「媽虎」的學校，到現在覺得一切的都是空泛：想求些實際的求學，毅然地離開了學校想自修，想補習，但是結果又使人失望，想再踏入學校之門，又因文憑而阻碍着自己的進取心：睜大了眼睛，看着成羣的失業隊伍中，很顯殊的大學生留學生也加入着，又使我心驚胆裂！啊，學生的悲哀呀！青年哀的悲呀！</p>

<h3>童年斷片的回憶（七）</h3>
<p>— 列火</p>
<p>媽媽聽了却說了一套慫恿話：「聽說縣長是杜老師底老朋友，那杜老師到衙門裏去充當一席，還有什麽問題！至少有九可可靠·去得，去得·杜師母快莫說這般冷話了，免了杜老師聽了灰心！」話剛說完，便向我注視了一番，摸着我底光頭；「你是杜老師底弟子，努力點，將來也好到衙門裏去！你看，你大哥不努力，弄成「牛屎燒灰無一成」註五，爸爸灰了心，才没有勇氣了，將你二哥三哥四哥留在家裏摸鋤頭柄，你還不努力呀！摸鋤頭柄是夠菁的，像牛馬一様！」</p>
<p>「是的，五寳快努力點，將來也好到衙門裏去，舒　服得多哪！」」杜師母哈哈地笑了。</p>
<p>杜師母走了，媽媽也便燒中飯去了。</p>
<p>從此全村底蒙童起了失學的恐慌，家長們忙着找老師，結果找到一位劉先生，這劉先生究竟是什麽大名，至今我還不知曉，他底綽號可仍依稀記得；松古董，也有呌他松矮子的，然以呌前者爲多，那是因爲他的確古董得可以，矮却並未矮到不成様子，雖然比普通人是要矮一寸，或者二寸。</p>
<p>這位劉老師確實有幾分古怪，隨便什麽時候，他總是鼓着腮巴哭喪着臉；有時也笑一笑，但，是苦笑。據說他幼小的時候，很有些靈秀氣，記憶力非常的强，那時人都說他有應童考的希望，然而他去應試，却觸了霉頭，「名落孫山外」，因此他頗有些懊氣，談到考官也便要嚕囌幾句說：「那是一些全没眼睛的東東！」他如此說了，便似乎覺得快意了不少，隨即笑了起來，苦笑的來由，大概源于此，然而他並不因此而餒志，他反而更努力了，他拼命地拏着一部四書備言讀了又讀，將全部的註解，都能背誦出來，然而他再試，三試，以至無數次的應試，却顀舊是托着大布長衫的劉先生，紅頂子還是不與他底頭皮發生依戀的關係，這可使他懊惱得呆了，於是替左鄰右舍寫口水信（註六）都没有清順的把握了，雖然他底四書備旨讀得很熟。</p>
<p>可是村上底人，對他依舊有很濃厚的信仰，恰像女人信仰觀音大士般的虔誠，說他是圈圍幾十里路以内的獨一大儒，有事要請敎他，寫作是不待說了；尤其樂意送小孩到他面前去讀書。</p>
<p>放「割稻學」的期滿了，劉先生底私啓了門，爸爸便把我送了去，「論語孟子讀完了，大學緩些兒再讀，現在開始讀幼學吧！」爸爸如此向劉先生供獻了意見，劉先生頗不以爲然，他底意見是如此的：「五經四書才是聖人之言，」</p>
<p>大道之旨在焉，不可不讀！至若幼學，不免有些俗俚，商人小販讀讀未始不可，儒人一讀它，便是白糟塌了時光！」爸爸掩飾地回答：「是的，反正我想拏儔兒去行小販的，所以讀幼學！若果劉先生有暇，請把論語孟子給他過細的解釋一遍好。」</p>
<p>事情便如此快定，我開始讀幼學。</p>

<h3>關乎好萊塢的幾個「片段演員」（上）</h3>
<p>— 希文</p>
<p>大明星的一顰一笑，一磬一欬，都是値得報章雜誌大字登而使我們留連傾想的。但是大明星之所以爲大明星，决不是她一個人演一齣獨脚戲，就可以做大明星的。俗語說，牡丹花好，還須綠葉扶持，又說是一將成名萬骨枯。戲台上有出將入相的名角，但是没有掮旗打傘的，就作不成戲。因此一齣影戲當中，除了大明星之外，必須還有許多配角。配角當中，有一種最爲我們所忽視，而却很重要的，就是一班「片段演員」。（bit　players）。没有影片可以離開片段演員，而一发由明星們包辦的。就是明星大會串時「大飯店」，以及不久將到上海的「八點鐘晚餐」，亦不能全片盡是有名的明星。於是乎這種「片段演員」，就比如戲台上的跑龍套，不重要而是不可缺少的。警如葛萊秦嘉寳坐一一輛華美的汽車，當然就不能没有一個汽車夫，那汽車夫就是一個片段演員。克拉克蓋博跑到酒店，和一個酒鬼打起來了，那酒鬼又是一個片段演員。汽車夫哩，强盜哩，政客哩，洗衣婦哩，警察哩，以及其他的一切小脚色，在影片裏露一露面，而即消逝的，都呌做片段演員。</p>
<p>他們雖是片段演員，他們却各有各的特長。當醫生的總是當醫生；當牧師的總是當牧師。他們從來不相混亂的。並且他們因为總扮演一種角色，積年累月，不知不覺的就被觀衆們看熟了。所以我們常常影片裏看到了一個了，不知不覺地喊道「那不是什麽什麽片子裏的那個看門的嗎？」而他們自己呢，却也專作一種角色，熟能生巧，而扮演得惟妙惟肖了。我現在先舉幾個最有名的片段演員出來，下次看影戲的時候，你可以稍爲旨意一些。就是你不想記住他們的名字，認識認識他們的面孔，亦是極有意思的。</p>
<p>第一個最有名的片段演員是愛立克曼因（Eric　Mayne）。那是包管你看見過不少次數的。他的特長是扮演醫生，牧師，律師，外交官，因爲他有長鬍子，頭髮鬈曲，很有些美髯公的風度，並且他態度嚴肅，所以扮演一種專家，些不露外行。論到他的出身，他是愛爾蘭人，在倫敦威士明斯德學過神學。很奇怪的，他後來意放棄了神道學，而去學戲。他善長的係莎翁的歌劇，到現在他還是落杉磯公共圖書館的一個莎翁名劇的講師。可惜他太不合時宜了，他從舞臺上做主角的地位，降而爲電影中的片段演員。加上他運氣很不好，妻子死了，兩個兒子亦在歐戰中打死了。他就成了一個孤獨的老年人了，他住在好萊塢一個小客庽裏，常自一個人出去散步。他衣服整潔，態度莊重，一望而知是位英國式的紳士，誰知道他是一個畸零傷心人呢。（未完）</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3>評「蠟像陳列所之秘密」</h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>The　Mystery　of　the　Museum丨大光明映丨</p>
<p>美國片在形式上極求完備，這是最爲明顯的事實。這固然證明他們在技術上有了極大的進步，同時爲了營業的發達，也得有好的形式以吸取觀衆。歌舞片是如此，而在歌舞片之外的恐怖片亦復如是。</p>
<p>說到恐怖片，使我們立刻想到「木乃伊」，以古屍復活爲號召，其引誘性的强烈可想而知。但因其慌誕無稽，必然的會遭受進步的觀衆所唾棄，因爲如此，聰明的製片者也就得在「神怪」之外而找尋可以代替神怪的題材。「蠟像陳列所之秘密」，無疑的是華納公司的聰明花様，製片者以暗殺事件極力誇張起來，以獲得和神怪同等的魔力了。</p>
<p>但是，我們對於故事的要求，是Story的其實性和普遍性，就這一作品的内容來說，我們却不能得着如上述二條件之完備。這不妨舉例證明。</p>
<p>我們固然承認，在現實社會機構之下，一切都是商品，所謂藝術者，也是商品的變相。因此，蠟像製作者用盡一切方法來攫利潤，這和現社會制度並不矛盾。同時劇作者告訴我們，彫刻家到底不容易支持，只能縱火焚燒自己的作品，以圖得保險公司之賠欵。但是我們就要問，這一彫刻家要塑古人的肖像，爲什麽一定要今人的死屍做模特兒呢？這是非常勉强的。而且，他在紐約所塑的　　蠟像的在倫敦所塑的相同，是不是倫敦所塑者也有死屍做模型？此足以證明劇作者，無非是要使這彫刻家殺人，便極力的想出了這一非常勉强的理由，而構成這不眞實的離奇的故事，卽使就有，也是很偶然的，决不是日常生活眞實的描寫。</p>
<p>所以我們可證明，以電影藝術賺錢，確是不易，在這金融恐慌，購買力衰弱的時候。雖然宣傳者一定要堂皇其詞的說，這是「攻擊現代藝術思潮之危險性」，可是我們在影片上所理解的却是製作者本身之瘋狂的暴露啊！以人體刑，成蠟像固然危險，而以如此怪誕的故事做作品的内容，其危險更等而上之。</p>
<p>說到恐怖片，我們又立刻想起「木乃伊」的化裝，那化裝術的神妙，眞令人佩服。在這裏，那種用松脂膠臉的方法又有同様的運用。彫刻家葉固當火灼之後，臉孔變成那般可怕，這是同有進步的化裝術不能成功的。（木乃伊化裝殯屍，這裏却化裝燒壞了面孔的人，應當比前者合理一些。）同時，弗德立馬區在「化身博士」中的化裝，千面人郎却乃的化裝，都足以說明劇藝在科學上之進步。</p>
<p>旣然說到了千面人，那末這裏的表演技巧，也和郎却乃相似的里昂亞德　Lion　Alwill也値得大爲稱讚。當他在火焚蠟像館的時候，他眼看着心愛的蠟像一個個消溶而毁滅，那種深刻的表情，給與我們最有力的印象。他除了化裝醜惡的面容之外，那種葉固的本來面目也是很好的，至給於女人「擊」破了假面具而顯出醜惡，自然有其象徵的意味，然而在情理上却不大妥當，假使說「抓」破了，說明那面具是軟質的，因爲經常戴着硬的面具，却不會逼眞而有生動的表情。</p>
<p>再說表演，那末女主角格鸞達范麗GlendaFarrell却眞是喜劇的天才。她流麗的口齒，活潑的表演，眞是恰到好處，但是她在廣告上却没有名字，反之不重的費蕾却做了宣傳的資料。這可看出商業上的矛盾現象，自然是因爲范　不及費蕾有名，我們固不必因費蕾的角色不重要而輕視她，然而她比在「恐怖窟」中的時候却仍然相等。其他配角中那飾施拜陸（彫刻家之助手）的也演得很好。</p>
<p>導演的手腕。和一般的恐怖片同様，很能够抓緊觀衆緊張的情緒。特别是快樂的騙子來寫這緊張的劇情，更覺另開生面而可愛。至於前部的一個高潮和最後的高潮，都處理得十分得當。其中恐怖的場面，固然不少了利用機關佈景或使人們疑神見鬼而故作驚人之筆，可是如像蝦蟆的呌聲，　開棺材發現威士忌，到底是十分巧的。</p>
<p>因爲是五彩攝影的原故，所以在形式上更覺美麗。最好的是蠟人館的陳列，在焚蠟人館，殯儀館的盜屍，新年的掛彩。假使不是五彩的話，上述諸場面决不會有如此成績。</p>
<p>最後，再說一句，美國片的製片技巧，眞有長足的進步，但是其資本也眞不小啊！</p>
<h3>「野茶花」評“Maid　of　The　Mountain”</h3>
<p>— 摩爾</p>
<p>强調着觀念形態的批評，旣然一概認作「公式」的批評，而遭到玉石俱焚的掊筆：這一個危機發展下去，一定要使正確的電影批評毁滅。所以在一個塲合之下，我是强調着電影藝術的觀念形態這一面的。自然，形式是内容决定的，正因爲形式是内容决定，所以眞的能夠把握着電影的觀念形態是不會，也不能不解决他的形式的。在目前的外國電影，我們常常看到完全相同的形式，（這裏當然不是狹義的），而這形式的完全相同，一定因爲他的内容是有共同的地方之故。（這當然也不是機械的指故事而言。）</p>
<p>「野茶花」是一張所謂「武俠歌舞」片，假使我們只是庸俗的的介紹着他的形式，那末，不要說讀者，即使一般的「批評家」，也一定要爲它的形式所迷惑。因爲到現在爲止，新的「美術觀念」，還没有在我們的一般「批評家」之間建立起來。我們只有從意義方面出發，纔能夠揭義形式的毒害性。</p>
<p>「野茶花」的製作作，是和所有的現代市民一様，身受着官吏的毒害的。所以在這張影片裏，他創造出一位「寨主」來作弄那新來而横暴的總督。他有意的把「寨主」寫得非常出色。「鎭上的住民」，因爲新總督的横暴，而「哀求帮助」。表明「寨主」是民衆請來的，是爲「民」，而不是爲「利」的。</p>
<p>但是，我們的製作者，雖則怨恨着當時的官吏，而對於促成官吏横暴貪汚的社會制度，和人民没有絕紙罷免權的法律，還是不感到怨恨，而深深的擁護牠。所以，他旣然不用民衆的力量罷免，或則拒絕這位横暴的新總督；而使人民哀求帮助於「寨主」。同時他更把被擒的「寨主」的釋放，也不放在民衆的威力之下，而放在還有十分鐘之久的舊總督的職權效能上；這是說明我們的製作者，是十足道地一個舊制度，舊法律的擁護者。</p>
<p>把這故事的本身來說，有的地方是不通的</p>
<p>第一，新總督没有到任，民衆就知道他是一個横暴的官吏，卽使他在别處做過官，民衆也不應求助於「寨主」。</p>
<p>第二，「寨主」旣然綑綁起新總督，而自己喬裝，那末，在深知新總督横暴的地方民衆。豈有完全不認識新總督之理？假使說民衆愛護「寨主」，那末，「寨主」自然更應該爲人們所熟識，保必待托　莎宣佈之後，纔拿他？</p>
<p>第三，新總督的横暴，旣然盡人皆知，那末，舊總督自然也知道：同時，舊總督也恨新總督之横暴而釋寨主，保以旣然釋之於後，又擒之於前？</p>
<p>其它小地方，更不用說。</p>
<p>導演因爲這故事是有很多歌舞的，所以對於很多地方忽略過了，而對於歌舞塲面，却有意拖長，這自然可以把這本影片更弄得「香艷」一些，但是因些也就使它更庸俗一些了。</p>
<p>演員們，在這個故事底下，自然有極多戲好做，所以每一個人都極努力！</p>
<h3>「人生」中之育嬰堂</h3>
<p>聯華一廠費穆導演之「人生」，現已抽製成就十分之九，不是全劇卽可完成。此劇中阮玲玉與林楚楚所扮飾之兩個女性，生命逾中均極坎坷。阮玲玉一生漂泊流浪，林楚楚一生和着孩子們過生活。日前，拍育嬰堂一場内景，事前由邢少梅購得大批摇籃及兒童用具。林楚楚化一老婦人裝，神態畢肖。育嬰堂之辦公人員，皆爲髮鬚斑白之老者。因爲這一塲戲需要多數嬰兒，所以在還未開拍之前，有許多婦人都抱着孩子集齊在攝影上，開拍時，她們都歡喜的把孩子放入摇籃裏，很是有趣，但是孩子們因爲離開他們的母親，便都放聲有大哭起來，可是因爲他們的哭，却拍成幾個異常精采的鏡頭。</p>
<h3>電影小說女人的弱點　My　Weakness（五）</h3>
<p>— 復生</p>
<p>龍納進來了。他告訴羅羅晨到她就要和吉拉特會見了。羅羅問他爲什麽一定要在時裝展覽會和他見面呢。龍納說他是從來不到什麽公衆集會的地方的，不過亭個時裝展覽會，他却不能不到，因爲他是格麗哥萊内衣公司的副經理，爲生意起見，不能不到也。於是龍納又敎給了些對付吉拉特的訣竅。他的吉拉特有兩種特異的嗜好。一種是喜歡吃生紅蘿蔔，一種是舊郵票。他說：「你應當告訴他，你亦喜歡舊郵票的。要是到了不得已的時候，你亦無妨吃些紅蘿蔔。我知道這個太爲難你了，但是……」羅羅柔聲的道：「祗要龍納呌我　不要說是吃紅蘿蔔，他的整套兒的舊郵票，我都吞它下去。」龍納道：「你要想法使他吻你……來，我來敎給你，這是女人敎不會的！」羅羅心裏想着和龍納接吻，不可太認眞了，因爲那不過和跳舞，打高爾夫差不多的功課。龍納又不是眞的要她接吻。但是當羅羅很難爲情似的將嘴唇凑上去的時候，怎麽……竟好像眞的似的。龍納笑道：「羅羅，你自己知道不知道，你接吻到是預内行的。」</p>
<p>到了明天晚上。羅羅和薏芙站在樓梯，看著下面，閙轟轟的展覽會。她扶住了薏芙，手是氷冷的，膝蓋有些發抖擻。他們看着許多模特兒穿了各式各様的時裝，在台上走著，法國的裁衣師蘭尼耳在人堆裏擠來擠去。一忽兒蘭尼耳站住了和一個瘦削的帶眼鏡的中年男子談着話。薏芙拿羅羅拉得緊緊的對她說道：「那個帶眼鏡的，就是吉拉特格麗哥萊，格麗哥萊内衣公司的副經理」。羅羅望過去，看見了吉拉特，她打了一個寒噤。狄安娜在旁邊鼓勵她道：「你可不能臨陣脫逃。你要知道你要是辦不好，龍納就變成一個窮光蛋了。」</p>
<p>羅羅在没有下樓之先，又由薏芙，茂琳等敎給了她許多閒話。於是他們就下樓了。龍納替羅羅和吉拉特介紹了一下。吉拉特眼睛白瞪瞪看了羅羅，透出十分的傻氣。羅羅幾乎要笑出來，可是她忍住了，裝出十分莊重的様子對著吉拉特道：「我們爲什麽不到廊檐外面走走，數數天上的星呢？」吉拉特立卽贊成了她的話走了出來。他告訴羅羅，他是很喜歡看天上的星辰的：他有一天數過天上的星，一共有一萬二千三百零八顆。他們在廊檐上談話的時候，羅羅聽得花盆後面有繙縴之聲，知道龍納和那一班女人，都在那裏偷聽哩。好吧，給他們聽聽吧。她於是對吉拉特道：「龍納那個人，使我厭煩極了。他祗知道女人，除此以外，没有一些别的本事！」羅羅說完了，隱約之中，似乎聽見龍納生氣的駡聲，她心中快活得很。（未完）</p>

<h3>The Situation in Fujian Eases丨Solution Still Not Hopeless丨 Li Jishen Remains in Hong Kong, Not Going to Fujian, Yang Dezhao Visits Hu, Urging Him to Go to Beijing, Chen and Hu Frequently Discuss via Telephone, Weng Zhaoyuan Flies to Province to See Chiang and Cai, Guangdong Authorities Consolidate Defense, Paying Attention to Promoting National Unification</h3>
<p>(Xiamen) The true situation in Fujian is still as in yesterday's telegram. Li Jishen has not actually arrived yet. He may go from Hong Kong to Xiamen and then to Fuzhou on the 17th. Whether there will be changes or not depends on whether Li comes and the outcome of the consultation. Also, after Lin Sen arrives in Beijing, whether the two sides can reach a consensus at the Beijing meeting is also crucial. It was rumored that Hu Hanmin had already come to Fujian, but he has not actually arrived yet. Furthermore, the political situation here deteriorated sharply, but it has eased in the past two days. Dai Ji came to Fujian and stayed in Xiamen for several days. On the 15th, he received a telegram from Cai urging him to go to the province, saying there was a turning point and urging him to come quickly. Dai then flew to the province, indicating there is still room for negotiation. In short, the current situation is still in the process of being resolved. (16th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Li Jishen was still in Hong Kong on the 16th. The rumor that he had already gone to Xiamen is inaccurate. (16th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Yang Dezhao's mission in returning to Guangdong: (1) Chen Jitang and Lin Yun'gai previously telegraphed the central government, requesting repayment of over 190 million in revolutionary military expenses from previous years for Guangdong to implement its three-year plan. The central government agreed to repay in installments, starting with 20 million, and specially requested Yang to return to Guangdong to convey this. (2) To urge Hu to go to Beijing to take on important positions. Chen Jitang quite agrees with this. Yang came to Hong Kong to discuss this matter with Hu. Chen Jitang has been frequently having long-distance telephone conversations with Hu in recent days. (16th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) The Guangdong authorities have recently paid close attention to promoting national unification and do not participate in other political side issues. According to a group headquarters source, regarding the matter of Fujian forming a five-province allied army, the headquarters has not received a telegram. The Guangdong political situation continues as before. In addition to suppressing bandits, they are striving to consolidate Guangdong's security. The headquarters has ordered Yang Dezhao to return to Beijing as soon as possible. Yang will return to the province on the 17th, stay for a day or two, and then return north. Xiang Hanping has decided to reside at the Nengren Temple on Baiyun Mountain for recuperation. (16th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) The Political Council telegraphed on the 16th, urging Li Zongren to return to Guangdong. The Southwest Diplomacy Research Association is scheduled to be established on December 1st, adopting a committee system. Tang Shaoyi, Chen Youren, Gan Jiehou, etc., are internally appointed as members. (16th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Fuzhou) Weng Zhaoyuan flew to the province this afternoon to see Chiang and Cai, reporting on the progress of recruiting and pacifying the local militia. Chen Qihao, a brigade commander from the province, responded to the request of the Pacification Commissioner's Office and arrived in the province today. Dai Ji has not yet decided on whether or not to become the Director of the Civil Affairs Department. (16th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Xiamen) Weng Zhaoyuan incorporated the local troops of Xingquan Yong. The Pacification Commissioner's Office limited it to 3,000 men, but the total number is 10,000. Weng telegraphed to request that the surplus be reorganized into a reserve standing security regiment. (16th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Guangzhou) A Reuters reporter, due to the rumors of Fujian province's independence in recent days, specially visited the representative of the 19th Route Army stationed in Guangzhou today. According to him, he has not received news about this new development. He feels that there will be no military action in Fujian province. The province is now very quiet. Guangdong province recently experienced rumors due to the resignation of several military officers, but it is now as peaceful as usual. However, the continued holding of military conferences, the redistribution of troops, and the arrival of a large number of bullets all indicate that the authorities are currently preparing for unexpected events. Deng Longguang's Fourth Independent Division has been transferred from Shaoguan to Huizhou, so the defense of Dongjiang has been greatly strengthened. (16th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Chairman Lin Returns to Beijing Lin Talks About Going to Fujian Purely For Personal Matters No News of Political Change</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Chairman Lin arrived in Beijing at 8:00 AM on the 16th aboard the Yingrui warship. Li Shijia, Mao Zhongfang, Lin Yushi, and Zhang Zhong, also came with him. Lin said that this trip to Fujian was entirely for personal matters, to sweep graves and visit friends. When Jiang Guangnai and Chen Mingshu came to meet, they just casually chatted and did not involve political matters. The various reports about building up the military had not been heard when I left Fujian, so I don't know what the truth is. Mr. Hu Zhantang seems to still be in Hong Kong. I also haven't heard the rumor that he will go to Fujian. (16th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Chairman Lin arrived in Beijing at 8:30 AM on the 16th aboard the Yingrui warship. Chen Shaokuan, Wang Shijie, Chu Minyi, Li Yuanding, Lu Chao, Wei Huai, and many naval officers of the National Government all took small boats to the center of the river to greet him. After the Yingrui warship anchored, warships of various countries fired cannons and raised flags in salute.

<h3>Japanese Side Claims That the Great Wall Passes Will Be Returned Next Spring Still No Concrete Decision on the Return of Linyu County After Arima's Departure, Shibayama and Others Will Be Responsible for Liaison Establishment of Customs Is Underway Small Passes Will Set Up Branch Checkpoints</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Arima is scheduled to return to Shanghai on the morning of the 19th. Shibayama and other Japanese military officials will liaise with the Political Reorganization Council on the return of the Great Wall passes and other issues. The Japanese side plans to return the Great Wall passes next spring. The small number of Japanese troops stationed at Gubeikou and Cheheqiao also plan to withdraw next spring. Okamura's arrival in Beiping at the end of the month is unlikely to materialize. Although negotiations on the return of Linyu County have begun, no concrete decision has yet been made. Regarding the merger of Japan and Manchuria, a spokesman for the Japanese Embassy said that there is absolutely no such plan. (16th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Customs will be established at the major passes of the Great Wall, and branch checkpoints will be established at the minor passes.

<p>(Beiping) Ding Guitang, the tax official specially dispatched by the Ministry of Finance to Beiping to assist in the establishment of customs, said that the establishment of customs is currently under investigation. Zhang Yongnian, the deputy tax official responsible for investigating the Great Wall passes, has already conducted one survey. He is scheduled to go to Gubeikou first on this trip, followed by inspection of the areas of Malan, Zhanluo, and Wenyu, returning to Beiping within a few days. He will then go to Tangshan, transfer to Jielingkou, Lengkou, and Xifengkou to investigate the actual situation. I plan to return to Beijing within a few days. After Tax Official Zhang completes his survey and returns to Beiping, he will also return to Beijing to report. After the central government approves, each pass can be put into operation. Regarding the establishment of customs at each pass, China has the right to autonomy, and there is no need to negotiate with the Japanese side. The establishment of customs and collection of customs duties by the puppet state outside the passes is purely illegal, and China will never recognize it. In the future, merchants may suffer considerable illegal losses, but this is a matter of fact and there is nothing to be done about it. Whether illegal facts exist or not, China will still handle matters in accordance with the original tax regulations. In addition to the planned passes, other small passes will also be established as needed depending on the actual situation. Reports that the central government denied the establishment of customs may be misinformation. (16th Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Rescuing the Decline of the Silk Industry</h3>
<p>— Ming</p>
<p>Silkworm farming is a major side occupation in our country's rural areas. It can adjust the imbalance of the agricultural economy and supplement the income of individual farmers. At the same time, it is also one of the prerequisites for the ideal of self-sufficiency. Therefore, it has a great relationship with the future of our country's national economy. Tracing back to the opening of the sea ban, the closed-door agricultural economy cannot compete with the capitalist organization, which is very clear. However, the balance of international payments still depends on export trade, and among our country's export trade, besides soybeans, it is raw silk and silk fabrics that are emphasized. But since the economic panic of 1929, the general consumption capacity of countries around the world has gradually decreased. The silk industry has also been affected, lingering on the road to decline. Taking the export of raw silk and silk fabrics from our country as an example, compared with the previous two years, the export value has decreased by half. Silk goods are piled up to more than 35,000 piculs. The total loss of silk workers has reached more than 12 million taels. Just considering the silk factories in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, there are 187 factories with modern organization. (Sichuan's transportation is blocked, and it has experienced years of war. Provinces with less production than other provinces are temporarily excluded from consideration.) Among these 187 silk factories, only 14 can barely maintain their operations. At present, the European and American silk markets are still stagnant, and the market price has fallen again. This autumn, the price of silk has fallen by another third compared to the spring. Although short-term silk industry bonds of 3 million yuan have been issued, with a subsidy of 140 yuan per picul, it is like a drop in the bucket, which is of no practical help. If the overseas silk market does not improve, then the future of the silk industry will be unknown.</p>
<p>We carefully examine the past history and observe the current situation to deeply understand the reasons for the decline of our country's silk industry. First, the overseas market can no longer accommodate the same amount of goods as before. In addition, the production of artificial silk products is progressing daily, and the price is more than half lower than that of silk. Since the raw silk market has been gradually eroded, it is difficult for the silk industry to be revitalized. Second, although our country's modern factory organizations have the name of scientific methods, they are actually mostly due to personal disputes, and often cannot establish a pure modern organization. The planning is not thorough, there are many loopholes, and the silk making method is relatively old. Japanese silk has seized the opportunity to almost completely occupy the American market. Our country's silk industry is therefore even more困顿. Third, our country's industrial operations mostly rely on their own subjectivity. Those who are diligent in their work can only protect themselves. Those who are inferior are quickly consumed, without waiting for accusations. Therefore, there is a lack of true understanding of market needs, especially overseas market needs. And they have never carefully investigated the psychology of general consumers. Although the export of raw silk is not as complicated as other types, we should study the needs of various silk weaving factories in Europe and America and how we should respond with our products. But compared with Japanese factories, our country's factories are ashamed. Fourth, modern industrial operation has shifted from small and medium-sized industrial operation to large industrial organization. The capital is becoming more concentrated, and the products are also being improved. Europe, America, and Japan have all progressed in this way. Our country's industrialists are the opposite. They only strive for the current market and do not worry about harming themselves. They also cannot unite to resist overseas forces. How can they protect themselves in this fiercely competitive environment?</p>
<p>Now that the world's decline has become a trend, it is still questionable whether the rigidity of the overall economy can be saved. It is really not easy for our country's industrial sector to open up new paths at this time. However, we absolutely cannot sit idly by and watch factories close down and workers lose their jobs. At present, the only way to seek immediate results is to provide subsidies from the Chinese treasury, or for the Ministry of Industry and the Ministry of Finance to jointly plan and raise public debt to purchase existing raw silk. Part of it is exported overseas, and another part is made into silk fabrics. All state-owned railways and government-run ships provide free transportation to various places and transfer them to consumers at low prices. Then the current difficulties may be barely overcome. As for the fundamental solution, it lies in cultivating the consumption capacity of the general society, stabilizing social order, increasing production, and raising the general standard of living. If the 400 million vast masses increase their consumption by an average of one yuan per person per month, the number is enough to transform the current stagnant economic situation into a lively one. It may even affect the world market. The silk industry will inevitably benefit from the entire economic recovery process and gradually move towards the road of regeneration and prosperity. Otherwise, the so-called rescue can only support for a while and will not last long. Therefore, it is appropriate to start with the temporary measures and follow with the fundamental solutions, which is also of great importance to today's entire national economy.</p>
<h3>The Truth About the International Arms Trade - Reaching US$6 Billion in Ten Years - The United Kingdom, the United States, France, and Czechoslovakia Account for Most of the Sales - Japan, China, and South America are the Largest Purchasers</h3>
<p>(Washington) According to the latest survey by the U.S. Foreign Policy Discussion Association, Latin American countries are also important markets for the international arms trade. The Chaco War and the Leticia conflict have allowed four or five major arms manufacturing countries to constantly supply the countries involved with war materials. It is found that in the ten years from 1921 to 1930, the total amount of international arms trade reached more than US$6 billion. Among them, British arms manufacturers sold US$155,510,000, French merchants sold US$124,638,900, and Czech merchants sold US$29,825,600. A considerable part of this amount was sold to South America. Because most South American countries lack arms manufacturing equipment, they mostly purchase from abroad. Among the 25 countries in the world that have national arsenals, only Chile in Latin America is included. According to British statistics, the largest purchasers of British-made arms in recent years are Japan, China, and South American countries. Among the South American countries, Chile ordered a lot from British factories between 1928 and 1929, and Bolivia also purchased a lot in 1929. In addition, from 1925 to 1930, Argentina, Brazil, and Colombia all had smaller orders sent to British factories. According to what the British authorities announced in the House of Commons, in 1932, British merchants sold 7,735,000 rounds of small arms ammunition to China and 5,000,000 rounds to Japan. Compared with the total of only 3,718,000 rounds sold to various foreign countries in 1930, the increase is considerable. By 1932, French arms exports totaled US$9,726,000, also a threefold increase compared to 1931. Among them, Argentina, Brazil, China, Poland, and Yugoslavia all increased their purchases considerably. For example, the value of goods shipped to Argentina was 44,744,000 francs, while in 1931 it was only 11,805,000 francs. The value of goods shipped to Brazil was 13,837,000 francs, compared to only 3,352,000 francs last year. The largest customers of American arms manufacturers are Canada, and Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, etc. also purchase from them. In addition, some South American countries also purchase arms from American merchants, but the number is relatively small. (National Telegram on the 16th)</p>

Its excellent performance, even compared with the famous British submarine tender Medway (15,000 tons, speed 16 knots (American submarine Holland, (11,570 tons, speed 16 knots), is clearly the world's unique warship.

<p>(New York) Newspapers here are commenting on the British government's naval construction program. "The New York Times" believes that the British expansion of the navy is due to the tension in the Eastern Question, saying that if the military party gains power in Tokyo in the long run, European countries and the United States cannot stand idly by in the face of Japan's ambition. British competition from Japan affects India, so it has to find ways to protect its commercial and shipping interests. The United States in the Philippines is in the same situation as the United Kingdom in India. Moreover, the United States is the maintainer of the open door in China. In times of emergency, the United Kingdom and the United States rely on naval power to exert pressure on Japan. (Havas Telegram on the 16th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese military, having learned from the Kanto air defense exercises, ordered the Army Aviation Headquarters to study countermeasures to cope with the crisis in 1935 and 1936. It is reported that a draft plan has been formulated to newly establish air defense aircraft teams in major cities such as Tokyo, Kyoto, Osaka, Nagoya, Fukuoka, and the military industrial center of Kitakyushu, at a cost of 20 million yuan. Although the Ministry of the Army is well aware of the financial difficulties, it believes that air defense is an urgent matter and has decided to ask the Ministry of Finance for temporary funds again.

<p>(Tokyo) Many Japanese islands have extremely inconvenient connections with the mainland. The Ministry of the Interior ordered various departments to study connection methods and decided to adopt radio communication methods. On the 21st of this month, ultra-shortwave radio equipment will be set up on both sides of Sakata City in Yamagata Prefecture and Tobishima Island in the Sea of Japan, with both broadcasting and receiving functions. Test communication will be conducted. If the results are good, the same method will be used to connect the 21 islands under the jurisdiction of various prefectures along the Sea of Japan, such as Aomori, Akita, Yamagata, and Niigata. At a time when Russo-Japanese relations are deteriorating, this type of plan is very noteworthy militarily. (China United Press Telegram on the 16th)</p>
<h3>The Kwantung Army Plans to Reorganize the Pro-Japanese Police in the Puppet State</h3>
<p>(Changchun) It is reported that the Kwantung Army, the Kwantung Government, and the Japanese Embassy have agreed that after the abolition of extraterritoriality, the Japanese police system will be abolished to unify the police force within the jurisdiction of "Manchukuo." Before the abolition of extraterritoriality, the Japanese police will be reorganized and placed under the control of the Japanese Embassy. This move is now awaiting approval from Tokyo.

<h3>U.S. Secretary of Commerce Announces Atlantic Aviation Plan - ▲Cost of 30 Million Yuan - ▲Floating Stations Set Up on the Ocean Surface</h3>
<p>(Washington) U.S. Secretary of Commerce Roper announced today the Atlantic scheduled aviation plan. The start-up funds have been allocated from the public works funds and will be prepared immediately. The estimated start-up funds are 30 million yuan. All aircraft will be purchased and operated by the U.S. government. In the future, it is planned to open daily scheduled flights between New York and major European cities, crossing the Atlantic in 24 hours. Along the way, a floating station will be set up every 500 miles on the Atlantic Ocean, equipped with repair shops and temporary lodging for passengers to prevent accidents. In the future, it is also planned to set up two rows of floating stations in the Atlantic Ocean, so that aircraft can depart from several major cities on the Atlantic coast of the United States, without being limited to New York. (National Telegram on the 15th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Secretary of Commerce Roper stated today that the Public Works Administration has allocated 1.5 million yuan to build a sea airport 500 miles from the Atlantic coast for testing. If the testing is satisfactory, many sea airports with a length of 1,250 feet will be placed in the Atlantic Ocean, each 500 miles apart, and will directly reach Europe. It is estimated that the total cost will be about 30 million yuan. In the future, when this plan is realized, any airline or private individual can pay fees according to the schedule and enjoy the convenience of landing. (Reuters Telegram on the 15th)</p>

<h3>A Solution to the Anti-Dumping Tax on Foreign Iron Will Be Decided Soon</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Shanghai Factory Federation reported to the Ministry of Finance and Industry that the price difference between national iron and foreign iron is 28 yuan, which has led to a sharp decline in the sales of national iron. Last month, they requested to increase the anti-dumping tax on foreign iron and reduce the mining tax to provide relief. According to Huang Jintao, the director of the Mining Department, the two points of levying anti-dumping tax on foreign iron and reducing the mining tax were discussed at the joint meeting last week. Because the representatives of various departments believed that the problem was serious and whether it was feasible or not, they had to ask their respective ministers for instructions, so no decision could be made at that time. Now they are separately requesting the ministers to give their opinions. At the second meeting on the 24th, a solution may be decided. (Special Telegram on the 16th)</p>

Because the Ministry of Finance added a new salt tax of one and a half yuan per stone, the people were devastated by the Red Bandits and their vitality had not recovered, so it was difficult to bear this heavy burden. The representatives came to Beijing from various counties to petition, determined to achieve the government's withdrawal of its order. The petitions have now been sent to the Central National Government and various ministries and commissions, and they are scheduled to petition separately in the coming days.

<h3>Soviet Russia Makes Concessions to the United States - Freedom of Religion Can Be Recognized by Russia</h3>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt and Russian Foreign Minister Litvinov met twice today. According to reliable sources, the situation is now better, and the outstanding issues between the United States and Russia are expected to be resolved. The general impression here is that Soviet Russia has agreed to discuss issues involving relations between the two countries, without making direct recognition a prerequisite for seeking understanding on such issues. It is reported that the U.S. President is now seeking an understanding that Americans in Russia have freedom of religion. According to Moscow sources, if this is the only thing hindering the United States from recognizing Soviet Russia, then this matter can be resolved quickly and Washington will be satisfied. The Russian side claims that foreigners residing in Russian cities have never experienced any difficulties in exercising their religious beliefs at present, because many churches continue to open in Russia. (Reuters Telegram on the 15th)</p>
<p>(Washington) The U.S. President continued to consult with Soviet Russian Foreign Affairs Commissioner Litvinov today. Although no official statement was issued afterwards, according to reliable sources, the resumption of relations talks has made significant progress. It is expected that the President will invite Litvinov to go to the hot springs for rest on Friday if the talks have not ended. (National Telegram on the 15th)</p>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt and Soviet Russian Foreign Affairs Commissioner Litvinov met at the White House before noon and after lunch. This was the first meeting between the two since the meeting on Sunday evening. Litvinov's audience with the President was not predetermined, as people generally believed that the President would only meet Litvinov after the issue of resuming U.S.-Russian relations was ready. In addition, Roosevelt told reporters that the U.S.-Russian negotiations were proceeding normally, and that even if no agreement was reached between now and Friday, or even until Monday next week, it should not be said that the Soviet Russian negotiations had failed. The President also said that his discussions with Litvinov had made progress and would continue to make satisfactory progress. (Havas Telegram on the 16th)</p>
<p>(Washington) The U.S. request that Soviet Russia acknowledge the debts owed by previous governments before the Russian Bolshevik Revolution is an obstacle to U.S.-Russian compromise. The United States advocates establishing a cooperative in New York to levy a surtax on U.S. goods sold to Russia to offset Russia's old debts. Litvinov is hesitant because this method would put Soviet Russia in a dangerous position with respect to other creditor nations. Roosevelt said that this surtax would be levied by the U.S. Export Trading Company (i.e., the above-mentioned cooperative), and Russia does not have to grant the same treatment to other countries.

<h3>The U.S. on the Immigration Issue - Revokes the Movement to Exclude Asians - Its Influence Has Expanded Greatly in Recent Months</h3>
<p>(Washington) Dickens, a member of the House Immigration and Naturalization Committee, is carefully studying the issue of revoking the law excluding Asian nations and formulating quotas to restrict Far East immigration, paying particular attention to whether this move can win the cooperation of Far East countries and prohibit the suggestion of smuggling Eastern people into the United States. According to reliable statistics, about 8,000 Eastern people are smuggled into the United States each year, so the next meeting of Congress may consider formulating a quota plan. The movement to revoke the law excluding Asian nations has gained great momentum in recent months. What is even more surprising is that California, which originally demanded the exclusion of Eastern nations, now has a large number of supporters of this movement. (National Telegram on the 15th)</p>
<h3>Rapid Changes in the European Situation: Germany and Poland Establish a Reconciliation Agreement; Britain Convenes a Four-Power Conference; Simon Departs for Geneva Today</h3>
<p>(Berlin) As a result of talks between Chancellor Hitler and the new Polish Prime Minister Lipski, Germany and Poland have established an agreement. This action is significantly related to peace in Europe. According to an official statement issued after the talks, the governments of Germany and Poland have now established a complete understanding. Hereafter, all related matters will be resolved directly through negotiations between the two governments. In order to maintain peace in Europe, Germany and Poland have agreed not to resort to force in matters of negotiation between the two countries. (Reuter, 15th)</p>
<h3>The German-Polish Declaration of Non-Aggression: A Major Factor in Stabilizing the European Situation</h3>
<p>Warsaw All newspapers state that after Germany and Poland established an agreement, Poland's security has increased, which is of great significance even in Europe and does not harm Poland's existing allies. "The Polish News" stated that among German politicians capable of making appropriate arguments, Hitler is the foremost. "The Polish Express" stated that the Locarno Treaty failed to guarantee the security of Europe's eastern borders; the current German-Polish declaration of non-aggression compensates for this deficiency. Furthermore, economic negotiations between the two countries are proceeding smoothly. "The Polish Daily" stated that the rapprochement between Poland and Germany is the policy embraced by the Minister of Military Affairs and General Piłsudski, who personally presided over it at critical moments. This agreement is the first step in the realization of Piłsudski's policy. (Havas, 16th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) The semi-official Wolff News Agency yesterday released a message stating that the governments of Germany and Poland both believe that common issues should be resolved through direct negotiations, and that force should not be used in mutual diplomatic relations. Observing this message, it is clear that relations between Germany and Poland are trending toward conciliation. If negotiations indeed lead to an agreement, then a major obstacle to stabilizing peace in Europe will be eliminated. The declaration of mutual non-aggression can be seen as a precursor to the establishment of a formal treaty of mutual non-aggression, the signing of which will not be far off. Since May of this year, German newspapers have ceased to comment on the "Danzig Corridor" issue. This is a clear indication of the Hitler government's initial need for peace. The second stage of the rapprochement between Germany and Poland will necessarily involve continued negotiations to end the economic warfare between the two countries since 1914. (These negotiations began on the ninth of last month.) The Berlin Daily recently published an article stating that after Germany and Poland reach a compromise, France will be more likely to approach Germany. The reason is that France has always spoken of the need to protect its allies. Now that France's allies have established friendly relations with Germany, the need for protection will naturally decrease. (Havas, 16th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) It is rumored that the governments of Poland and Germany have reached an agreement in principle regarding the issuance of a declaration of non-aggression. The Disarmament Conference was both surprised and pleased by this news. Since this news originated from both Warsaw and Berlin, it certainly has the effect of easing international tensions. However, there is one condition: the spirit ostensibly displayed by the Berlin government must not be negated by facts, and must not be contradicted by the issuance of any document. French figures in Paris and Geneva do not view this news as surprising and are in fact quite pleased, as this agreement is in line with France's policy of pursuing a common European understanding.

<h3>Britain Actively Salvages Disarmament; Has Already Contacted Various Countries Separately</h3>
<p>(London) The government held two meetings this morning and evening to study the current disarmament situation. The British government is not only in contact with the governments of France, Italy, and the United States, but also, more importantly, is engaging with the German government in order to find a way for Germany to return to the Disarmament Conference and the League of Nations. It is heard that some cabinet members have previously advocated that preliminary talks between countries, especially between France and Germany, should take place at a location other than Geneva. There is talk of a hypothetical location in London. Outside sources speculate that the cabinet holds differing opinions on Foreign Secretary Simon's handling of the disarmament issue, but the responsible sectors do not take seriously the rumors that the Foreign Secretary will resign. (Reuter, 15th)</p>
<p>(London) Judging from the situation of the two cabinet meetings yesterday, the British government is determined to prevent the current disarmament stalemate from continuing indefinitely. It is widely believed that Germany has reaffirmed its goodwill through its diplomatic channels. British officials are now increasingly inclined to make practical concessions to Germany's views. Talks between the governments concerned will continue, with the primary aim of reconciling the views of France and Germany, in order to pave the way for a compromise with Germany. The meeting place for representatives of the major powers appears to be Rome, rather than London. (Reuter, 16th)</p>
<p>(London) The Disarmament Conference is in a deadlock. Today's cabinet meeting seeks to find a way out. If no proposals are made by foreign parties within the next few days, the British government will abandon its wait-and-see policy, which it has adopted since Germany's withdrawal from Geneva. (Havas, 15th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) At the last meeting of the Steering Committee of the Disarmament Conference, cabinet members from the major powers did not attend, which Chairman Henderson found very unsatisfactory. Smaller countries also hold the same view, believing that this action hinders the progress of negotiations. Representatives from Greece, Czechoslovakia, the Netherlands, Norway, and Poland originally intended to jointly issue a declaration in support of Henderson. However, these representatives have now decided to urge Henderson to consult with the Vice-Chairman of the Disarmament Conference, Politis (Greece), and the Czech representative Beneš, to jointly issue a statement to all members, drawing their attention to the need for the major representatives to remain in Geneva in order to advance the work of the Disarmament Conference.

<h3>A Four-Power Conference Will Open in Rome</h3>
<p>Simon Departs for Geneva Today</p>
<p>(London) Foreign Secretary Simon and Under-Secretary Eden will depart for Geneva tomorrow to discuss with Disarmament Conference Chairman Henderson the matter of reconvening the Disarmament Conference. The British Cabinet has resolved to convene a Four-Power Conference in Rome to exchange views, in the hope of concluding a disarmament convention. Rome is widely seen as a natural meeting place, as Germany is unwilling to return to Geneva. However, France favors Geneva, which is a major difficulty. It is heard that regardless of what happens in Geneva, the British government still considers its draft convention to be the basis for all future work. Furthermore, Geneva will discuss the possibility of convening a conference of signatory states to the Four-Power Convention. (Reuter, 16th)</p>
<p>(London) British Foreign Secretary Simon and Under-Secretary Eden have decided to depart for Geneva on Friday. Today, Disarmament Conference Chairman Henderson spoke at length with the two men via long-distance telephone, strongly arguing for the necessity of chief representatives to attend the Steering Committee meeting on the 24th, and urging the two to set out on their journey. It is also heard that the two will urge French Foreign Minister Paul-Boncour to travel with them when they pass through Paris. In addition, it is heard that Henderson has also requested the Italian chief representative to attend the Steering Committee meeting, as Henderson still hopes to salvage the collapse of the Disarmament Conference.

<h3>France Tentatively Approaches Germany; Says Saar Issue is Negotiable</h3>
<p>(Paris) Foreign Minister Paul-Boncour's speech in the Chamber of Deputies yesterday will be printed in pamphlets and distributed to the governments and foreign affairs committees of parliaments of various countries. Responsible officials state that, from France's perspective, the League of Nations and the Disarmament Conference still exist, and all diplomatic actions should still have Geneva as their destination. The recent wavering attitude of Britain towards the Disarmament Conference, and Mussolini's criticism of the League of Nations by Italy, cannot change France's attitude. Furthermore, the misunderstanding between Italy and France has been resolved, and the points agreed upon by Britain, the United States, France, and Italy at the end of September remain the same. From these two perspectives, we can still have some hope. The difference between French and Italian views lies in the international organizations in Geneva. Paul-Boncour's stance is to always trust the League of Nations and the Disarmament Conference, while Italy wants negotiations between several strong countries to replace the various international conferences attended by all countries of the League of Nations. Such is the difference. As for the possibility of direct negotiations with Germany, the general principles held by France remain consistent: Germany proposes a plan, and then it is studied and discussed using diplomatic means, based on the spirit of international cooperation and coordination. For example, regarding the economic relations of the Saar region, negotiations can begin from now. If the people of the Saar vote in 1935 and decide to cede the Saar to France or return it to Germany, then this matter will become a purely Franco-German issue. In addition, responsible officials also stated that Franco-Russian relations have been fully improved, and France has sent technical commissioners to Soviet Russia to replace the German technicians who have been dismissed.

<h3>French Newspapers Reveal Secret German Documents; Claim Germany Wants to Drive a Wedge Between British and French Relations</h3>
<p>(Paris) It is heard that the German government has sent instructions to its representatives and secret operatives in North and South America, instructing them on how to conduct anti-French propaganda. These secret documents were published today by the "Le Petit Parisien" newspaper here. According to the report, "France is Germany's irreconcilable enemy." As for Britain, it is "France's strongest ally and the most dangerous to Germany. Therefore, Germany should diplomatically strive to disrupt relations between these two countries." The document discusses Germany's views on world policy, stating that "Germany, no matter what, must achieve the goal of revising the peace treaty. Germany's demands are roughly as follows: (1) All territories with German minorities must be returned to Germany. (2) Germany's former colonies must be straightforwardly returned to Germany. (3) Germany should obtain genuine equal rights in armaments and reject any international arms control system. It is naturally difficult to fulfill these demands, but Germany has no other option at present. In this matter, world public opinion is very important, so the German government is determined to sacrifice huge amounts of money to gain the sympathy of world public opinion." "Le Petit Parisien" stated that the above is the principle of German propaganda, and the methods it uses will be announced later. (Havas, 16th)</p>
<h3>Britain Approaches Us; Conservative Party Members Advocate Moving the Embassy South</h3>
<p>(London) The London Times today published a letter from Conservative Member of Parliament, Mr. Lunn, stating that Britain should end the isolated status of the British Embassy in Beijing, and that the British Ambassador should have a residence in Nanjing or Shanghai, so that he can reside in Nanjing or Shanghai for six months each year. Lunn also mentioned the emptiness of the House of Lords' discussion of this matter on November 8, stating that if our policy is to be effective, it must be judged based on the facts seen by the British Ambassador in China, and cannot be imagined from 10,000 miles away, and the British Ambassador must have close contact with important figures in Nanjing, in order to achieve its purpose, and cannot be blindfolded, groping for news in the dark, and indirectly forming its conclusions.

<h3>US Treasury Secretary Woodin Retires</h3>
<p>Roosevelt Appoints Morgenthau as Acting Secretary</p>
<p>Initial Victory for the Inflationist Faction</p>
<p>(Washington) The first crack in the Roosevelt government has now appeared. It was learned today that Treasury Secretary Woodin submitted his resignation several days ago. President Roosevelt has decided to grant him a leave of absence. The so-called leave of absence is purely a face-saving measure. President Roosevelt is now in fact the master of the Treasury Department. Although he has appointed Morgenthau, the director of the Farm Credit Administration, as Acting Secretary, Morgenthau will not hold back President Roosevelt. Undersecretary of the Treasury Acheson also resigned. Currently, Morgenthau is temporarily serving as both Secretary and Undersecretary of the Treasury. Officials say that Acheson voluntarily resigned to make way for Morgenthau, but non-official sources say that Acheson resigned in opposition to President Roosevelt's monetary policy.</p>
<h3>Differing Political Views Lead to Leave of Absence</h3>
<p>Although rumors that Woodin and Acheson intended to leave the Treasury Department have been circulating for many weeks, they suddenly became a reality today. People in Washington were shocked, as if struck by lightning from a clear sky. According to President Roosevelt's announcement, Woodin will be on leave starting at the end of this week.</p>
<p>When the Senate investigated the business of Morgan Bank, it implicated Woodin, pointing out that Woodin was one of those who became wealthy by following the advice of Morgan and others to engage in speculative activities. At the time, many expected Woodin to resign because of this, but Woodin still did not leave.</p>
<p>Woodin has recently been suffering from a throat ailment and has been regularly treated by specialists. He submitted a letter of resignation several days ago, but President Roosevelt did not accept it, but instead asked him to temporarily put aside all administrative matters and concentrate on recuperating. Hence, today's announcement of Woodin's leave of absence. However, once Woodin leaves, he will not return.</p>
<p>London is very concerned about the new developments in Washington today, because Woodin and Acheson were both advocates of sound money. If they do not hold the reins of finance, it is feared that monetary policy may deviate from the right track.</p>
<p>The fact that the price of gold in the United States has not changed has made the US dollar show some improvement today. The British Exchange Equalization Fund is no longer used to maintain the gold standard, but the trend of competing to buy pounds has surged again. In addition, the news from Washington that the Treasury Secretary has changed has made the US dollar weaken again, reaching a new low of one pound equaling five US dollars, forty-one and a half cents.</p>
<p>Morgenthau is the son of the former US Ambassador to Turkey and is only forty-two years old. He is relatively young among cabinet members. He was educated at Cornell University and later entered the publishing industry. During the war, he served in the Navy and followed President Wilson for many years. He served as chairman of the New York State Agricultural Advisory Board. (Reuter, 15th)</p>
<h3>Strange Cold in the US Freezes Dozens to Death; Japanese Cargo Ship Aground, Suffers Heavy Losses</h3>
<p>(New York) The United States is experiencing a strange cold, which has already frozen twenty people to death. Pennsylvania has experienced a record snowfall of 41 inches. The poor weather has affected navigation. Storms have swept through the Great Lakes at speeds of 40 miles per hour, causing two cargo ships to run aground and two others to be damaged. A Japanese cargo ship ran aground at the port of Chiminas in Canada, and it is reported to have suffered heavy damage. Snow covers the ground everywhere in the Midwest, and the weather is very cold.

<h3>Acting Secretary Supports Gold Purchase</h3>
<p>(New York) Morgenthau announced his firm support for President Roosevelt's policy of buying gold at home and abroad in the hope of raising prices. According to the New York Sun, Morgenthau advocated halving the gold content in the US dollar and opposed stabilizing the exchange rate early. The first split in President Roosevelt's cabinet is seen as a setback for the sound money faction. Rumors are now rife, with some saying that government officials have differing opinions, and others saying that Treasury Department advisor Sprague and Federal Reserve Bank President Black will both resign. Wall Street does not pay much attention to the resignation of Woodin and Acheson, but believes that this is the initial step in the inflationist faction's active pursuit of its monetary movement. (Reuter, 16th)</p>
<p>(Washington) It is learned that there will be further changes in important personnel in the Treasury Department. Although Woodin solemnly stated in his letter of resignation that the Treasury Department fully supports the President's monetary policy, it is widely rumored that Woodin has always opposed this experiment. It is also said that Treasury Undersecretary Acheson also disagreed with the monetary policy, so he resigned when Woodin took leave. It is also heard that Woodin's assistant, Klemmer, will also resign from the Treasury Department soon. Treasury Financial Advisor Sprague, a former advisor to the Bank of England, has always opposed expanding the currency to save the low price of goods. He is also seriously considering the issue of resignation. In addition, the position of President of the Federal Reserve is said to be vacant soon, but the current President, Black, is only temporarily in office. (National Telegram, 50th)</p>
<h3>Monetary Doubts Are Becoming Increasingly Strong</h3>
<p>(New York) The doubts about currency in the securities market for several weeks have become increasingly strong today due to the sudden change of senior officials in the Treasury Department. People in Wall Street explained that Woodin's leave, Acheson's resignation, and Morgenthau's taking office were all concessions made by the US government to the inflationist faction. Because Woodin has always been recognized as the leader of the sound money faction in the Treasury Department in the monetary war in Washington, and Morgenthau has always been known for his tendency to inflate the currency. Therefore, people in Wall Street believe that this change will not hinder the progress of suppressing the gold dollar. (National Telegram, 15th)</p>
<h3>The Shock at Home and Abroad is Very Strong</h3>
<p>(New York) President Roosevelt wants to give his gold plan a complete experiment, supplemented by sympathetic officials, and will not allow others to obstruct it. Washington dispatches from newspapers here claim that President Roosevelt is the most agile and scheming political strategist in the United States.</p>
<p>Acheson, who has now resigned from his position as Undersecretary of the Treasury, stated today that not only does he have doubts about the appropriateness of the gold plan, but also those who remain in office due to President Roosevelt's personal feelings have the same doubts as him. Acheson is a friend of bankers such as Morgan, and the bankers accuse the Financial Rehabilitation Agency of illegally buying gold. Morgenthau, the current Acting Secretary of the Treasury, is a close friend of President Roosevelt, and he studied under Professor Warren, President Roosevelt's trusted advisor.</p>
<p>Officials have not yet commented on yesterday's developments, but Senator Harrison said that inflation will be realized in an instant, and Senator Thomas said that when the value of the US dollar is halved, it can be stabilized by international agreement, and the remainder will be used as the basis for expanding the currency. Wall Street is now silent. A financial reporter for the New York Telegraph said that our monetary policy is now advancing towards destroying the credit of our currency assets and investments. There is no hope of stopping the outflow of US dollars until our gold policy is completely abolished.</p>
<p>The liquidation of the Morgan Securities Group is widely believed to be evidence that Wall Street is concerned about inflation. It is rumored that the United Kingdom is now considering temporary emergency legislation in order to block the outflow of funds from the United States. After this news was transmitted, the outflow of US dollars accelerated. The New York American reported that the current state of the US dollar's actions may not be an indication that the gold policy is powerless, because the Financial Rehabilitation Agency can sell gold abroad and recover a large number of US dollars. British Deputy Finance Minister Ross has now set off to return home, expressing pessimism about the possibility of resolving the war debt and the future of American finance. (Reuter, 16th)</p>
<h3>Britain and France Are Most Anxious</h3>
<p>(London) Business circles in London are all concerned that a low US dollar may have an impact on suppressing the value of the pound. However, the fact that British railway revenue is still high and trade is also expanding can still be comforting. Silver trading seems to be purely speculative. The United States is freely selling in the London market on the one hand, and vigorously buying in New York on the other hand. A Washington dispatch from the Times says that President Roosevelt is determined to dominate the international gold market, not only wanting to raise prices in the United States, but also in all parts of the world. There is no doubt about this. However, the continued decline in US government bonds and the impact on European currencies will eventually prevent President Roosevelt from achieving his goals. US prices have not yet responded to President Roosevelt's policies. (Reuter, 16th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The dismissal of US Treasury Secretary Woodin is seen as a victory for the advocates of currency inflation, because the monetary faction sees Woodin as the stopper of their ambitions. The financial markets were not affected by Woodin's resignation. The French are quite concerned about the United Kingdom's actions in maintaining the currency price with the equalization fund, because the stability of the pound is even more related to France than the stability of the US dollar. (Reuter, 16th)</p>
<h3>Satisfied with the Implementation of the Gold Purchase Policy</h3>
<p>(Washington) The White House stated that the US President feels satisfied with the implementation of his gold purchase policy, so he does not intend to change the plan at present. Today, the monetary issue has been temporarily put aside, and attention has been turned to unemployment relief. The President urged the governors, mayors, and local relief directors who came to the White House to fully cooperate with the central government's plan to employ 4 million people within one month, and solemnly stated that the government does not intend to gain any political benefit from this relief plan. (National Telegram, 15th)</p>
<p>(Washington) General Johnson, the executor of the National Recovery Act, has now reported to the US President that the provisions in the rules of the Recovery Act for increasing work and placing the unemployed are not fully complied with and must be strictly enforced. (Reuter, 15th)</p>
<h3>Huge Fraud Case in London; Merchant Harman Sentenced to 18 Months in Prison</h3>
<p>(London) The case in which Harman and other directors of the Korea Society were accused of fraud in transactions with Japanese subsidiary companies in order to deceive shareholders has been finalized today. The jury found that Harman had committed 21 of the crimes listed in the indictment, so the judge sentenced him to 18 months in prison. Cornelius Lev was convicted of conspiracy and sentenced to six months in prison, but was pardoned. The chairman of the society, Pons, and Zhang Ge were found not guilty and acquitted. The protagonist of this case is very famous in the history of the City of London, because Harman started as a clerk, and the companies he manages today have a total capital of 14 million British pounds. The businesses involved include rayon, gold mines, oil, rubber, and brewing. A few years ago, he bought Lundy Island in the English Channel for 16,000 pounds, minted coins, printed stamps, and promulgated laws on the island, so he was once given the title of uncrowned king of Lundy Island. Later, the government considered Harman's minting of coins to be illegal, and Harman lost sovereignty over the island. Harman originally planned to go to the Far East in March of this year to inspect the industries of the Korean Conference, but was unable to do so due to his arrest. (Reuter, 15th)</p>

<h3>He Yingqin Arrives in Tianjin, Holds Banquet for Jin Yunpeng, Sun Chuanfang, etc., Hoping to Jointly Eliminate the North China Crisis</h3>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: He Yingqin, Chairman of the Beiping Branch of the Military Affairs Commission, arrived in Tianjin yesterday (the 13th) at 11:20 AM, accompanied by his wife, as well as Liu Duoquan, Song Zhenqu, Zhu Shiqin, Chang Jingwu, advisors to the Military Branch, and Tao Shangming, commissioner of the Luanshu Administrative Office. Provincial Chairman Yu Xuezhong led Wei Jian, Director of the Civil Affairs Department, Chen Baoquan, Director of the Education Department, Mayor Wang Tao, Ning Xiangnan, Director of the Public Security Bureau, and others to welcome him at the train station. When the special train arrived, security personnel provided special protection, prohibiting unauthorized persons from entering the platform. After the train stopped, He Yingqin alighted, and Yu Xuezhong and others approached the train to greet him. They then rode together in automobiles to the provincial government to rest. Immediately, a banquet was held at the provincial government, with the directors of various departments in attendance. After the meal, He Yingqin, accompanied by Liu Duoquan, went to visit at the Friendship Office. At 5:30 PM, he went to the Ning Apartment on Haihe Road in Special District One to rest. He stayed there overnight. Yesterday afternoon at 5:30 PM, He Yingqin met with reporters at the Ning Apartment to discuss his mission in Tianjin, as well as issues such as the Beiping-Shenyang railway opening, the restoration of postal services outside the pass, and the return of the five passes of the Great Wall. The discussion was roughly as follows:</p>
<h3>He Yingqin's Remarks</h3>
<p>1.  I have no particular mission in coming to Tianjin today. I have passed through Tianjin many times before, but have never gotten off the train. Beiping and Tianjin are large cities in the north, and they are very close to each other. Since I came to Beiping, how could I not come to Tianjin? So this time, I specially found an opportunity to come and see. I have some old classmates and prominent figures here whom I haven't seen for a long time, and I want to meet with them today. The return of the five passes of the Great Wall is not a problem. The Japanese side has already agreed on this matter, and it will be implemented as soon as the barracks outside the pass are repaired. It is expected that this can be done soon. Okamura recently went to Beiping, but there was no formal discussion regarding the opening of rail and postal services and the Luandong aftermath. The two sides only exchanged opinions. The opening of rail service may be done in the shortest possible time, but the specific details were not discussed in detail at the recent meeting. I have not heard about the postal service matter. There are also no major difficulties with the Luandong aftermath. The troops stationed in various places will remain the same. As for the conflict between the Tang Yulin and Liu Guitang units in Chahar Province, it was caused by a misunderstanding over disputed territory. Both parties have reported claiming victory, but according to reliable information, the Tang unit may have suffered considerable losses. This matter will be investigated by Commissioner Song Zheyuan nearby, and the true situation will be clarified after the report arrives.</p>
<h3>Banquet for Prominent Figures</h3>
<p>Last night at 7:00 PM, He Yingqin hosted a banquet for prominent figures from all walks of life at the official residence on Bei Ning Road in Special District One. Those in attendance included Jin Yunpeng, Qi Xieyuan, Sun Chuanfang, Chen Guangyuan, Cao Rulin, Zhang Zitan, Wang Chengbin, Bao Guiqing, Gong Xinzhan, Pan Fu, Gao Lingwei, Cheng Ke, Zhang Zongxiang, Lu Zongyu, Wu Yulin, Zhang Boling, Wang Wenxing, and over fifty others. Provincial Chairman Yu Xuezhong, Tianjin Mayor Wang Tao, and Yin Tong, Director of the Bei Ning Bureau, also attended as hosts. During the banquet, He Yingqin delivered a speech, saying, "I, Yingqin, was ordered to come to the north, and it has been almost a year now. I have long wanted to find time to come to Tianjin to pay my respects to you gentlemen and receive your teachings, but I have been burdened with military documents and busy affairs. I have been thinking about it for a long time, but it has been difficult to fulfill my wish. Recently, various matters have gradually been sorted out, so I made a special trip here to offer a cup of wine and express my heartfelt admiration and respect. I am honored that you gentlemen have not rejected my humble self and have graced us with your presence for a joyful gathering. You gentlemen have all shouldered significant responsibilities for the country in the past. Although you have now laid down your burdens and are living in seclusion, your responsibility to the country remains the same, whether in or out of office. In my humble opinion, I hope you gentlemen will not hesitate to offer your valuable advice at any time and on any matter. Today, our country is plagued by bandits, year after year of disasters, rural bankruptcy, and industrial and commercial decline. The suffering of the people can be said to be extreme. If we want to alleviate the suffering of the people, we must first eliminate the bandits and revitalize the countryside. We must concentrate the surplus funds from the cities and transfer them to the interior villages as much as possible, and actively engage in construction and revitalization work. We must first ensure that the villagers have food to eat, and then the people in the cities will not starve. On the other hand, we must also find ways to change the psychology of the general public and use the money deposited in large banks in the cities to vigorously develop the border regions, so that the inexhaustible resources can be used to the fullest extent for our benefit. Regarding transportation, the active construction of railways, highways, aviation, and other industries is also a matter of utmost urgency. A week ago, my brothers and I went to inspect the Qinglongqiao area of the Beiping-Suiyuan Railway, and after admiring the bronze statue of Mr. Zhan Tianyou, the creator of the Beiping-Suiyuan Railway, I felt even more that China today needs hundreds of millions of Zhan Tianyous and other talents in order to be saved. If everyone only knows how to set up exchanges and open large stores in a few large cities, exploiting the blood and sweat of the majority for the enjoyment of the minority, then the result of such abnormal development will be of no benefit to the country, and the suffering of the people will only deepen. I also feel that the chaos in the country in recent decades has been due to the decline of national consciousness, and the decline of national consciousness has been due to the degradation of national morality. Because the people of the country regard morality as unimportant, many unfilial, unbrotherly, disloyal, untrustworthy, impolite, unjust, dishonest, and shameless things can be done. The sanctions of the law are not enough to control people's hearts, and the defenses of morality have disappeared. How can the country not be in chaos? How can it not fall into an incurable state? If we want to uplift the sunken hearts and save the declining national situation, the only way is for the government and the people to work together to restore the inherent morality of our nation: filial piety, brotherly love, loyalty, trustworthiness, propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame. Only by restoring these inherent virtues can we remedy the shortcomings of the law and enable the Chinese nation to be revived. I also feel that there is still a great crisis lurking in North China today. What is the crisis? It is the secret activities of the Communist Party. The Communist Party was also not noticed in the provinces of Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, and Fujian, but when its power grew, it began to burn, kill, and loot, turning the land red for thousands of miles. Although the activities of the Communist Party in North China are not yet obvious, if we do not think ahead and take precautions, it will become uncontrollable once it breaks out. The method of prevention, if only to hold military police at any time, anywhere detect arrest, prohibit its writing propaganda, at most only stop a while, if to really manage fundamentally, then the first condition, still is to find ways to relieve the people pain, so that the people can live and work in peace, each do their best, to seek the enjoyment of food, clothing, housing and transportation, the second condition, Beijing is to restore national morality, so that everyone takes the eight words of filial piety, brotherly love, loyalty, trustworthiness, propriety, righteousness, integrity and shame as the highest principle of life, then the Communist Party will have no way to take advantage of the opportunity to operate. Some of you gentlemen and I have worked together, and some of you are meeting for the first time. There are many things I want to say, but due to time constraints today, I cannot talk as much as I would like. I am really very sorry. I would like to offer a cup to wish you all good health."</p>
<h3>Jin Yunpeng's Reply</h3>
<p>After He Yingqin finished his speech, Jin Yunpeng represented the guests in giving a reply, which lasted for an hour and a half. The gist of it was: "It is a great pleasure to hear Mr. He's speech. This is the first time in recent years that we have heard such frank and honest words from the authorities. We are especially grateful for Mr. He's efforts and results in maintaining security in the north. Most of us have held positions of responsibility in governing the country, but we are very ashamed that we have accomplished nothing over the years. We only hope that the current officials will follow Mr. He's words and work in a down-to-earth manner. We must know that although the Chinese nation is now on the verge of collapse, according to historical records, we can assert that there will still be a day of revival. Back when the Five Barbarians caused chaos in China, our Han people were not destroyed. At that time, the Han people in Shandong, Henan, and Hebei were almost completely slaughtered. The situation was even more tragic than the current invasion by the violent Japanese. However, when Emperor Taizong of Tang emerged, the foreign invaders were still swept away, and China was still the world of the Han people. The same is true of the Liao, Jin, Yuan, and Qing dynasties. The reason for this can be deeply considered. It is true that China has thousands of years of culture, a vast territory with abundant resources, and a coastline of over 10,000 li. It is located in the frigid, temperate, and tropical zones, and can be called a land of natural wealth. It has a population of over 500 million, who are able to endure hardship and work hard. With such favorable natural conditions and the addition of human effort, decades or centuries later, we will definitely still be the leaders of the world. Based on this inference, I hope that the people of the country will not be pessimistic. As long as we are realistic and pragmatic, China will not find it difficult to have a day of restoration. Today, all of you gentlemen present, those who were in the government in the past but are now out of office, naturally do not want to change their nationality in middle age and willingly become slaves to a conquered nation. Of course, we will all work together to assist the authorities in overcoming the national crisis. As for communism, I have studied it extensively and firmly believe that it is a doctrine that will destroy our national culture. We absolutely cannot allow it to exist in China. It can be said that it is fortunate for the future of the country that the authorities have made a firm decision on this." (14th)</p>
<h3>Active Progress on Opening Railway and Establishing Customs Posts, Iron and Finance Ministries Both Send Specialists North to Assist, Joint Railway Operations Adopted and Railway Bureau's Preparations Ready, Investigation into Establishing Customs at the Six Great Wall Passes Underway</h3>
<p>Beiping Correspondence: After Okamura arrived in Beiping and consulted with Huang Fu on various issues between China and Japan in North China, the principles were already determined. Among them, the acceptance of the various passes of the Great Wall was a point of agreement between both parties, and there were no problems. Issues relating to the opening of rail service, establishing customs posts, and restoring postal services, on the other hand, involved the puppet organizations and caused significant disagreements. Official circles have recently determined the necessity of opening the railway and establishing customs as matters of expediency. Regarding the question of the railway, the railway bureau had already proposed plans, which were sent to the Ministry for deliberation and action. The Ministry of Railways also sent specialists, like Guang Yu, north to help. They proposed using the joint operations method. The railway bureau has prepared various procedures and is generally ready to implement them. Everything will be actualized upon the approval of the Ministry. As for the matter of establishing customs, the government's execution is also progressing actively. The Ministry of Finance sent Hanwen, the secretary of the chief tax inspectorate of customs, as a tax inspector, Ding Guitang, to Beiping for contact with the various factions. He was also at the disposal of North China's governing authorities. More recently, Zhang Yongnian, the assistant tax inspector, was sent north to investigate actual circumstances along the Great Wall passes. China's customs regime, as a system, is uniquely special. Even after the September 18th Incident and the loss of the Three Northeast Provinces to the enemy, the customs offices of the northeast were able to carry out their duty until September 15th of last year, when the Japanese formally recognized the puppet state's armed and illegal seizure of customs. China was left with no choice but to formally announce the recall of customs workers on September 25th. It also declared the closure of the customs at Andong, Binkou, Niuzhuang, and Huichun. All the taxes collected were to be replaced by collection at the coast from Jin, Donghai, Jiao, Jianghai, Zhejiang, Min, and Yue sea customs. The customs at Shanhaiguan and Qinhuangdao have not been occupied to this day. However, Japanese cargo passes through it by relying on its special escorts, without taxation, going over the border, and the tax customs cannot control it. Since the loss of Rehe, to evade customs tax, foreign cargo has taken Rehe as a detour to enter North China, and our customs revenue has decreased, so that there is no way to prevent the dumping of foreign goods. At the same time, the puppet regime established a general customs at Chengde of Rehe, and established branch customs at Luanping, Lingyuan, Chifeng, Pingquan, Gubeikou, and elsewhere. China's cargo bound for the northeast is taxed again and again. Under such circumstances, not only are there massive loopholes, but the impact on national welfare and people's livelihood is extremely significant. This is the reason why the government is planning to establish tax customs at the Great Wall passes. The proposed methods are roughly as follows: A. The nominal question, to avoid involvement of the puppet regime, two methods are planned. (1) The Northeast customs will establish Great Wall posts to perform their duties. (2) To be named the branch posts of the nearby customs. For example, those close to Tianjin, would be named as the branch customs of Jin sea customs, those close to Qinhuangdao, would be named the branch customs of Qinhuangdao, etc. B. The sites of the posts have not been fully determined. After the on-site investigation and observation of the needs, a determination will be made. Those under consideration, in addition to Shanhaiguan, are about Gubeikou, Xifengkou, Panjiakou, Yiyuankou, Jielingkou, Lengkou, and other five locations. C. Methods of taxation, several principles have been decided. (1) Although the northeast has been occupied, it is still our territory. The native goods of the northeast entering the pass are not subject to import tax, but rather a transit tax. (2) The originally designated thirty-six kinds of northeast native goods will continue to be taxed according to the law. Goods other than foreign goods and the thirty-six kinds of native goods that are produced in both the northeast and Japan and Korea will be subject to import tax, in order to prevent the intrusion of foreign goods. (3) Goods transported from the interior to the northeast will not be subject to export tax. (4) Tax rates will remain the same, with no special regulations. Zhang Yongnian, the assistant tax inspector in charge of investigating the actual situation of the Great Wall passes, was originally scheduled to depart yesterday (13th). Appropriately, because of rain and snow, he could not begin the journey. He is now scheduled to travel to the Gubei area with Huo Shi, the director of the Jizhou-Miyun administrative officer's office, to inspect the area. Among the problems of customs tax posts in preparation in the north are, (1) Before full acceptance of the Great Wall passes and complete withdrawal of Japanese soldiers, the realization of the customs posts will be obstructed. (2) Even with the establishment of tax customs posts at each pass, the Japanese side will still have goods transported, as in the story of Shanhaiguan. Under the power of certain strong escorts, they will force passage, and the tax customs will still not be able to control it, then the tax customs at each pass are equal to fictitious posts. The government is paying close attention to this matter. In the sound of our planning and establishment of customs posts, the puppet regime's activity has also been expanding. Yesterday, Gao Yanagi Shigejiro, the Japanese supervisor director of the puppet Chengde tax customs, arrived at Qian'an with more than twenty personnel, claiming that the puppet regime planned to establish a tax customs along the border between Qian'an and Rehe, to collect customs tax, and has come to investigate.

In the morning, Liu Heding, Commander of the 56th Division, specially sent his adjutant Song Yuting to the province from Jian'ou by plane to report to Cai on the recent bandit situation in northern Fujian. In the afternoon, Cai convened a meeting at the Pacification Headquarters to discuss the bandit suppression plan in northern Fujian and local rehabilitation matters. It is said that the bandit suppression plan is to focus on the four counties of Chong'an, Guanghua, Jianning, and Taining in the bandit area of northern Fujian, which have not yet been pacified. Zhao Guantao's army from Zhejiang has already reached the border of Chong'an, and Zhou Hunyuan's army from Jiangxi has reached the border of Guangze. It has been decided to order the two brigades of Zhang Luanji and Liu Shangzhi to advance towards Chong'an, and the two brigades of Zhou Zhiqun and Situ Fei to advance towards Guangze, in coordination with the Guomindang armies of Jiangxi and Zhejiang. The two counties will be recaptured in a limited time so that they can be connected with the two provinces of Jiangxi and Zhejiang. As for the rehabilitation of the bandit area, it has been decided to form a Rehabilitation Committee for Northern Fujian, to be established by the end of this month. Work will begin next month, and efforts will be made to gather the refugees back to their hometowns and restore rural order within a short period of time. In addition, the newly appointed Director of the Civil Affairs Department, Dai Ji, arrived in Xiamen a few days ago and was invited by Mao Weishou, Commander of the 61st Division, to visit Quanzhou yesterday. He will arrive in the province by long-distance bus today or tomorrow. The date of his assumption of office will be determined after he arrives in the province. (November 15th)</p>
<h3>Chiang Kai-shek Cables Wang Jingwei and Kong Xiangxi, Requesting Prompt Allocation of Short-Term Relief Funds, To Allocate 2 Million Yuan in Full Within Three Months, To Handle Rehabilitation in Bandit Areas, So That It Can Advance in Parallel with Military Operations</h3>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: Chiang Kai-shek recently submitted a proposal through the Central Political Council to allocate 15 million yuan for long-term rehabilitation and 2 million yuan for short-term relief to bandit-affected areas, and also formulated various methods for long-term and short-term relief. However, the short-term relief funds have not yet been allocated by the central government, causing considerable difficulties in preparing for rehabilitation. He recently telegraphed President Wang Jingwei and Minister Kong Xiangxi again, requesting that the 2 million yuan for short-term relief be allocated in full within three months as soon as possible, so that military operations would not be hindered by politics and could advance in parallel. It is said that Wang and Kong have replied by telegram that they will do their best to raise funds to meet the urgent needs. The following is Chiang's telegram to Wang and Kong: "Respectfully acknowledge the Fish Secret Telegram. The 1.8 million yuan for short-term relief for bandit-affected areas is purely for the needs of accommodating refugees, distributing emergency relief, relocating the elderly, weak, and disabled, reforming and educating those who have surrendered, organizing local militias, establishing blockades, constructing bunkers, building roads, and appropriately calculating construction costs, as well as subsidizing all county and district administration expenses in recovered areas. It must be complementary to the progress of military operations; otherwise, even if military operations are successful, they will be completely ineffective. The various bandit forces in the border areas of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui have been successively defeated, and the campaign in the central and northwestern parts of Jiangxi is also nearing completion. However, the necessary emergency facilities following the army cannot advance in parallel due to a lack of funds, causing military operations to be delayed and unable to develop rapidly. The importance of this relationship has been described in detail in the telegrams of August (August) and May (21). In the Dongwei telegram of this month, it was repeatedly stated that all of the above uses are all urgent needs that cannot be delayed at present. Since the Political Conference approved the order on August 25th, the Ministry of Finance has been ordered to allocate the funds in full. However, several months have passed, and no amount has been actually provided. The headquarters has been transferring funds from the east to the west to cope with the situation, and it has now reached a point where it cannot continue to do so. Brother Yongzhi has only agreed to borrow 200,000 yuan in advance, which is not only a drop in the bucket but also of no use. Moreover, the work of military advancement and short-term rehabilitation cannot be interrupted. No matter how difficult it may be, please make every effort to raise the 1.8 million yuan for short-term relief within three months and allocate it in installments. (Omission) I eagerly await a satisfactory reply." (November 14th)</p>

<p>Guangdong Provincial Army to Be Reorganized</p>
<p>Xiang Hanping and Li Yangjing Resign Successively</p>
<p>Miao Peinan Appointed Deputy Commander of the Second Army</p>
<p>Huang Renhuan Succeeds as Commander of the Third Army</p>
<p>Each Army Increases Strength by One Division into a Three-Division System</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Guangdong Province has recently been quite active in reorganizing military affairs. Xiang Hanping, Commander of the Second Army, has submitted his resignation, which has been approved by Chen Jitang, who will concurrently serve as Commander of the Second Army. It is reported that Mr. Xiang left Guangzhou on the evening of handing over military authority. Chen Jitang, in order to reorganize the future army units, convened a military conference once on the morning of the 10th at 9:00 AM. Li Yangjing, Commander of the Third Army, was not present and submitted his resignation. Those who attended on that day included Yu Hanmou, Miao Peinan, Du Yiqian, Wu Fan, Zhang Zhiying, Tang Haoqing, etc. During the meeting, the reorganization of the military system was proposed and discussed in great detail. Some suggested abolishing the army commander and taking the division as the unit. Others suggested maintaining the current military system and expanding it to a three-division structure for each army. The majority favored the latter proposal. However, since each army currently only has two divisions, it is necessary to add one division to complete the three-division quota. The method is to merge the independent divisions into the various armies, i.e., the Independent Third Division under Li Hanhun will be reorganized into the Third Division of the First Army, the Teaching Division under Miao Peinan will be reorganized into the Sixth Division of the Second Army, and the Independent First Division under Huang Renhuan will be reorganized into the Ninth Division of the Third Army. The Independent Fourth Division will be renamed the Independent First Division. The detailed measures will be handed over to the Military Affairs Department to formulate the establishment, and then formally announced. The establishment of each army has been roughly drafted, but the selection of senior military officers for the assignment was also discussed during the meeting. As a result, Miao Peinan, Commander of the Rescue Teaching Division, will be promoted to Deputy Commander of the Second Army, Zhang Guoyuan will be transferred to Chief of Staff of the Second Army, Tan Sui, Deputy Commander of the Teaching Division, will be promoted to Commander of the Teaching Division, and Huang Renhuan, Commander of the Independent First Division, will succeed Li Yangjing, who has earnestly resigned, as Commander of the Third Army. Zhou Zhi, former Chief of Staff of the Third Army, will be transferred to Major General Staff Officer of the First Army Group Headquarters. Deng Qing'ao, Director of the Military Supply Department and Director of the Rear Affairs Office of the Third Army, has also been dismissed. The vacancy will be filled by Jian Zuozhen, the current Counselor of the Headquarters. After the military conference on the 10th, the society still feels calm as usual. If there are no other problems, it will be implemented in accordance with the resolution. Regarding the air force, there have also been some new arrangements in recent days. Yesterday, the Air Force Department transferred the Third Air Squadron stationed in Shaozhou, Beijiang back to the province, and transferred the Sixth Squadron under Ma Tinghuai to Shaozhou for defense. The Fifth Air Squadron under Wu Jianwen recently destroyed two aircraft in Meixian, and four airmen were killed. It is now planned to send several more aircraft to replenish them. (November 14th)</p>
<p>Songjiang</p>
<p>Petty Thief Commits Murder of Victim</p>
<p>A resident with the surname of a certain village in the ninth district of Punan Ninglong Temple, who was of modest wealth, had been coveted by thieves. It was heard that around midnight on the 15th, the whole family was asleep when thieves pried open the front door, intending to commit theft. The victim heard the sound of something being pried open and knew what was happening, so he got up to investigate. He spotted a thief on the ladder, groping around in the dark. The victim remained quiet and approached to capture him, but the thief suddenly became aware and took out the sharp knife he was carrying to resist. The victim was caught off guard and was stabbed in a vital spot, falling to the ground and crying out in pain. The family was alarmed and got up to see what was happening. The murderer immediately fled through the door, and the victim died from his serious injuries shortly thereafter. The village police from that district have rushed to Songjiang to report to the County Court and request an investigation. It is reported that the Procuratorate will send personnel to the village on the 17th for an on-site investigation.</p>
<p>School Site Dispute Remanded for Retrial</p>
<p>The case of the dispute between the site of the Provincial Experimental Primary School next to Songwei Road and the land of Zhang Jiecai has been litigated. Zhang Jiecai appealed to the Shanghai District Court, which ruled that the case was a civil matter and remanded it to the Songjiang Court for retrial. The school authorities then asked Deputy Director Niu to mediate and were willing to buy back Zhang's land at a price. They telegraphed Yin Shisheng to discuss with the Zhang family. It is reported that the Zhang family replied that since the case had been litigated, they should wait quietly for the court's judgment and politely declined Deputy Director Niu's mediation. The Songjiang Court has notified both parties to open a hearing on the morning of the 17th.</p>
<p>Wuxi</p>
<p>Tao Linshu Accused of Embezzlement</p>
<p>Feng Yunchu, General Manager of the Shanghai Great China Maritime and Land Transportation Company, recently discovered that Tao Linshu, the bookkeeper of its Wuxi branch, had used the names of others to pay more than 4,000 yuan during the suspension of railway freight during the January 28th Shanghai War last year. Therefore, he specifically filed a lawsuit with the County Court Procuratorate of this county, accusing Tao of embezzlement and seeking to recover the embezzled 4,000 yuan. Judge Ren Xianhai once summoned Tao for questioning and ordered Tao Linshu to submit a cash guarantee of 1,000 yuan and a written guarantee of 1,000 yuan. Since he could not raise the money in time, he was ordered to be detained. Yesterday, Judge Ren summoned the plaintiff Feng Yunchu and witnesses again, and signed to bring Tao Linshu to court for continued questioning. He reviewed the accounts one by one in court for a long time. As a result, the plaintiff and witnesses were ordered to return, and the defendant was still escorted for detention.</p>
<p>Niu Tiesheng Sends Personnel to Wuxi for Internship</p>
<p>Niu Yongjian, Vice President of the Examination Yuan and Minister of Personnel, has not only been engaged in political work in recent years, but also devoted himself to public education. For example, the Qiantang Public Education Center was also founded by Mr. Niu. Recently, in view of the lives of fishermen, the knowledge of fishermen related to national defense should be given considerable infusion. Therefore, a Fishermen's Education Center was set up in Jinshanwei, Songjiang, to train fishermen. The presidents of the Provincial Public Education School of this county, Gao Jian Si and Jiang Wenyu, were convened for discussions and appointed Ling Yijiu, Yang Piji, Jin Zhiyu and others, graduates of the Provincial Fisheries School, to come to Wuxi to the Education Institute to practice various activities.</p>
<p>Jiangyin</p>
<p>Xiao Qingyang Cocoon Firm's House Sealed</p>
<p>Huang Gonghe Cocoon Firm in Xiao Qingyang, south of the county, secretly set up a red pill organization. On the 27th of last month, the county magistrate and the Public Security Bureau cracked the case and escorted the caretaker Zhu Genquan to the county. He confessed that the red pill powder and other items were moved from Shen Wenhua's house in Qingyang a few days ago by Xu Zukun and others, the managers of the Cocoon Firm. He said, "I am the person who looks after the cocoons and have been looking after them for more than 20 years." According to the confession, Magistrate Ruan stated that since the Cocoon Firm's house was exclusively used for manufacturing red pills, it was a kind of equipment organization. The owner of the house did not report it in advance and did not declare it afterwards, which clearly showed that he knew about it and concealed it. On the 14th, he specifically ordered the bailiffs to seal the Cocoon Firm in accordance with administrative punishment. In the future, no matter who it is, no one may enter or leave without permission. He also ordered the arrest of the wanted fugitives.</p>
<p>Provincial Order to Take Over the Southeast Three School Associations</p>
<p>Wu Yan Yin from the Beijing academic circles, Xu Zhengji from the Shanghai academic circles, Wu Zixiu from the Suzhou academic circles, and Jiang Zhuo from the Zhenjiang academic circles sent a telegram to Director Zhou of the Education Department, ordering the property of the Southeast, West, and Shazhou three school associations to be handed over to the Education Bureau for receiving. Zhang Qi, a member of the academic circles in various townships, and Qian Xiaozhen and others opposed it. Now this case has been submitted to the Provincial Government Conference for discussion and a resolution has been passed. It has been submitted to the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Interior, and the Executive Yuan for approval. On the 13th, the county magistrate was instructed to quickly take over the two school associations in order to rectify them. Magistrate Ruan immediately instructed the Education Bureau to handle and report back.</p>
<p>Zhenjiang</p>
<p>Construction of Eight Township Pond Projects</p>
<p>The Zhenjiang County Pond Project Committee, in order to alleviate the rural economy, raised funds to build pond and water conservancy projects in various townships, which has been going on for three or four years. The third phase of the project this year started in ten townships, with a total of 797 ponds dredged. In addition, Huangxu New Village undertook the construction of several ponds and dams. The San Yi River in Jinshan was dredged for 80 feet, and the excavated soil was estimated to be about 50,000 to 60,000 portions, benefiting many fields. Today, the Committee convened the fourth phase of the project meeting, chaired by Committee Member Liu. More than a dozen surveyors and assistants from various townships attended the meeting. The matters resolved were: (1) Starting from the 11th of this month, the pond projects in Dantu, Renrang, Changle, Gaozi, Shangdang, Suifeng, Yucheng, and Chongde eight townships will be launched. (2) The construction of the embankment in Yonggu Township will be handled by Committee Member Xu.

<p>Yangzhou</p>
<p>Opening of Yangzhou Flour Mill</p>
<p>The Yangzhou Flour Mill, the first of its kind in Yangzhou City, opened the day before yesterday. The factory had sent invitations to all walks of life to visit the factory in advance, so those who went to congratulate were endless. The factory is located outside Bianyi Gate and has been preparing for years with a capital of 200,000 yuan. It has 11 grinding machines and sells 3,000 bags per day, requiring more than 1,000 shi of wheat. It is designated as the "Longevity Star" brand and has external farms in Gaoyou, Taizhou, Jiangyan, Lujin, and other places, as well as sales offices in various ports. Its internal organization is divided into seven departments, with about 300 office staff, machine workers, and cargo workers. The scale is very large.</p>
<p>Provincial Order Prohibiting Huai Transportation of Rice and Grain</p>
<p>The Provincial Government, according to the report of the Provincial Federation of Commerce, stated that rice and grain from Huainan to Huaibei were being blocked by someone along the way who refused to let them pass, which was obviously a fraud by ruffians. The Jiangdu County was specially ordered to comply. If the above-mentioned obstruction of transportation occurs, it should be strictly prohibited.</p>
<p>Hangzhou</p>
<p>Female Student Falsely Accused of Obtaining Money, Detained in Court</p>
<p>Zhang Helian, a Hangzhou native who once studied at the Hangzhou Women's Vocational School, is now over 20 years old and is dressed fashionably. She lives at No. 155 Qingtai Road, which was moved to Pingpingfang, Huixing Road this spring. She has a female friend named Zhang Zijie who is in financial difficulties. Zijie borrowed 15 yuan from Zhang. The day before yesterday, Zhang went to collect the debt. Zijie was unable to repay it. Helian said that she had an urgent need and now had no money. She had a local bank's 1,000 yuan fixed deposit passbook and asked her to help introduce her to pledge 400 yuan to meet the urgent need. Zijie agreed and helped to introduce the mortgage. Helian immediately took out a passbook and handed it to Zijie. After Zijie got the passbook, she secretly ordered her sister to inquire. The local bank informed her that one yuan in the passbook had been altered to one thousand yuan and wanted to detain her and send her to the Public Security Bureau for handling. After repeated discussions, and claiming that Zhang Helian would be arrested, she was allowed to return home and informed her sister, who reported to the police station to arrest Zhang and send her to the District Court for handling.</p>

<p>Local News</p>
<p>Kong Xiangxi Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday to Discuss the Central Government's Attitude Towards the Fujian Incident</p>
<p>Differing Opinions Should Be Addressed with Frankness</p>
<p>If the Worst Comes to Pass, Political Methods Will Be Used to Resolve the Issue</p>
<p>Greatly Hope that Mr. Hu Hanmin Will Go to Beijing as Soon as Possible</p>
<p>Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi arrived in Shanghai by overnight train at 7:30 yesterday morning. He returned to his private residence on West Avenues Road for rest. Ms. Soong Mei-ling, wife of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, who flew to Shanghai from Jiangxi the day before yesterday, visited Mr. Kong around 9:00 yesterday morning and had a conversation for about half an hour. At 11:00, Mr. Kong met with reporters from various newspapers and then went to the Central Bank to work.</p>
<p>The following is a record of Mr. Kong's remarks:</p>
<p>The Change in the Fujian Situation Seems Unbelievable</p>
<p>According to Mr. Kong, there have been widespread rumors in recent days that there will be changes in the Fujian situation. The central government has not yet received accurate reports on this matter. Chairman Lin will arrive in Beijing today (yesterday), and the truth should be revealed. However, according to my observation, at this time of serious national crisis, the people of the whole country are united to seek national salvation. Fujian Province will never take advantage of the opportunity to make changes and promote the reason for destruction. The 19th Route Army has made great contributions to resisting Japan and suppressing bandits and will never destroy its glorious history and make relatives sad and enemies happy. Moreover, the leaders of the Fujian Incident who are rumored outside all have a long history with our party and will never take actions that endanger the party and the country. Even if there are any differences of opinion, it should not be difficult to suggest to the central government without taking any rash actions.</p>
<p>The Central Government's Attitude Is to Meet with Sincerity</p>
<p>When reporters asked what the central government would do if the rumors unfortunately became a reality, Mr. Kong replied that the central government adopted an attitude of meeting with sincerity towards all parties. If unfortunately, the rumors became a reality, the central government would be magnanimous and resolve the issue through political methods. In short, at this time of internal and external troubles, the country is in danger. All Chinese people must unite sincerely and work together to save the situation. The central government is making every effort to unite within the party, and it also sincerely hopes that all parties will unite and concentrate the power of the whole country to strive hard.</p>
<p>Hope Mr. Hu Will Go to Beijing as Soon as Possible</p>
<p>Since the September 18th Incident, the central government has always taken unity against foreign aggression as its main purpose in order to save the country. Therefore, it is hoped that Mr. Hu Zhantang, who is living in Hong Kong, will focus on national affairs and return to Beijing to take office as soon as possible. Mr. Hu previously stayed in Hong Kong for recuperation due to illness. Recently, his health has gradually recovered. The comrades of the central government regard Mr. Hu as one of the standing committee members of the Central Political Council and sincerely hope that he will come to Beijing as soon as possible to share the arduous tasks. Mr. Hu is an advanced member of our party and has a long history with our party and the General. He will never betray our party. Mr. Kong believes that the rumors that Mr. Hu is going to Fujian or even that Mr. Hu has arrived in Fujian are definitely not accurate.</p>
<p>A Financial Conference Is Not Necessary for the Time Being</p>
<p>Mr. Kong also talked about the central government's finances, saying that the central government's finances are based on increasing revenue and reducing expenditure. I have said this repeatedly. For example, in economic principles, Denald (demand) and Supply (supply) must be consistent. Those in charge of finance must also ensure that legitimate needs have legitimate supply, that is, so-called measuring income to determine expenditure and measuring expenditure to determine income. As for convening a national financial conference, there is no need for it at present. We should "do more and meet less."</p>
<p>Post-Disaster Relief in Bandit Areas to Be Remitted for One Month First</p>
<p>Finally, when reporters asked about Chairman Chiang's request for the allocation of funds for post-disaster relief in bandit areas, Mr. Kong said that the work of treating the symptoms in bandit areas should be actively carried out. People who are unwilling to be ravaged by bandits and flee from bandit areas must be given relief. Relief must have expenses. This matter was originally approved by the Central Political Council for 1.8 million yuan. Chairman Chiang had previously telegraphed to request allocation. The funds were agreed to be paid in three months. The Ministry of Finance has first remitted 600,000 yuan for the first month, etc.</p>
<p>Naming Ceremony for the Two Routes Aircraft to Be Held Tomorrow</p>
<p>Security and Transportation Have Been Agreed Upon</p>
<p>The Two Routes Air Defense Committee invited military and police agencies in Shanghai to discuss the security and transportation of the naming ceremony of the aircraft on the two routes at the Two Routes Administration Bureau conference room yesterday. Li Guangzeng (Public Security Bureau), Wang Enchi (Security Office), Sun Jiaqian (Public Works Bureau), Li (Public Security Bureau), Lin Wojiang, Wu Yucang, Guo Xuezhang (China Aviation Association), Xie, Gong Guodong (Two Routes Police Station), Chen Yixin, Zheng Youshang (Songhu Garrison Headquarters), Li Dasan, Zou Zhengjian, Wei Yunlou, Zhang Yunhe, Xie Chengyu, Yuan Boyang, Chen Chengshi (Two Routes Party Headquarters) Chairman Yuan Boyang (Xie Chengyu acting) attended the meeting. After the chairman reported the significance of the meeting, he said that the naming ceremony of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo aircraft would be held at 2:00 pm on the 18th of this month. Today, we invite everyone to come together to discuss and resolve the security and maintenance of traffic order at the conference. The comrades of the two routes are very grateful for your willingness to come. Then, the following resolutions were discussed and passed: (A) Conference security, (1) The conference venue is divided into two parts for security inside and outside the venue. (2) The security inside the venue is jointly responsible by the Security Office, Garrison Headquarters, and the Two Routes Police Station. (3) The security outside the venue is the responsibility of the Public Security Bureau.

(5) The train to and from Xujiahui donated by the Two Routes comrades to the "Government 克持士" aircraft station is responsible for maintaining order by six military police officers from the military police company stationed at the North Station. (6) Each truck from Xujiahui to the Hongqiao Airport is maintained by a military police officer from the Garrison Headquarters, a total of fifteen trucks. (7) The order of the Xujiahui Station is maintained by ten police officers from the Public Security Bureau. (8) The commander-in-chief of the military police at the conference is appointed by the Garrison Headquarters. (9) The security inside the venue will be completed before 12:00 noon on the 18th, and the security outside the venue will be completed before 12:00 noon. (B) The conference military band is appointed by the Public Security Bureau. (C) The admission tickets for the conference are checked jointly by the road police boy scouts, the Public Security Bureau, and the conference staff. (D) One-way traffic route, (1) The outbound route goes directly to the airport from Hongqiao Road. (2) The return route returns to Shanghai from Paifang Road, Pears Road, and Yuyuan Road. (E) The admission certificates for news reporters and photographers are distributed by the Shanghai China Aviation Association.</p>
<p>Sun Tonggang's Ambition</p>
<p>To Fly to Southeast Asia and the World</p>
<p>Sponsored by the Flying Society But Did Not Donate Aircraft</p>
<p>Aviator Tonggang came to Shanghai this time to accept the aircraft donated by Mr. Du Yuesheng. He test-flew at the Hongqiao Airport the day before yesterday with excellent results. Yesterday, Mr. Sun told reporters that he planned to stay in Shanghai for another four or five days and then take the aircraft donated by Mr. Du back to Jinan. Sun also said that this time he returned to China with four major goals. First, to complete the Euro-Asia cross-country flight, which has been fulfilled as desired. Second, to fly across the country, which has also been successful recently. Third, to fly to Southeast Asia, which is planned to pass through Hong Kong, Guangzhou, Manila, Singapore, Sumatra, Java, Sanbaolong, and other places back to China. However, this flight has more sea routes than land routes, which is different from the previous Euro-Asia cross-country flight, which had more land routes than sea routes. Therefore, it is necessary to purchase a new type of aircraft that can be used for long-distance flights. For this reason, it can be realized at the end of this year or in the spring of next year. After the third goal is completed, he will go to Germany again to carefully study aircraft manufacturing, hoping to gain something. Finally, he prepares to complete the fourth goal, which is to fly around the world. At that time, he may compete with aviators from all over the world and win glory for the motherland. Mr. Sun finally said that he extremely approved of the Flying Society and hoped that it would achieve something as soon as possible. However, Mr. Lin Wojiang said yesterday that he would donate the new aircraft donated to him by Mr. Du Yuesheng to the Flying Society, which was not true. However, he would assist in the progress of the Society as much as possible.</p>
<p>U.S. Minister to Review Troops This Morning</p>
<p>To Leave Shanghai Tomorrow for a Tour of Southern China</p>
<p>U.S. Minister to China Johnson, who arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday from Beijing, now knows that the Minister is scheduled to review the Fourth Regiment of the U.S. Marine Corps stationed in Shanghai at the Jing'an Temple Road Racecourse at 10:00 this morning, and is scheduled to leave Shanghai tomorrow, with Admiral Obergahn, Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Asian Fleet, to tour various ports in South China.</p>
<p>Hu Hanmin Still Residing in Hong Kong</p>
<p>Chen Jitang Urges Hu to Enter Beijing</p>
<p>Changes in the Fujian Situation Difficult to Realize</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, rumors have been circulating for days that there will be changes in the political situation in Fujian Province, and that Mr. Hu Zhantang, a member of the Central Committee, has arrived in Fujian, etc. Yesterday, the reporter specifically visited a friend of Mr. Hu to inquire about Mr. Hu's whereabouts. According to the friend, Mr. Hu had just telegraphed that he was still residing in Hong Kong and had no intention of going to Fujian, which proved that the rumors were inaccurate. Moreover, as far as I know, Chen Bonan (Jitang) also urged Mr. Hu to enter Beijing as soon as possible to realize sincere unity. The planning of the Fujian Incident was only the trivial act of politicians close to Chen Zhenru (Mingshu) and some intellectuals from the so-called Third Party and Social Democratic Party. Gui Army generals Li Zongren, Bai Chongxi, etc., do not approve of it. The so-called five provinces in the Southwest are even castles in the air. Therefore, changes in the Fujian situation are difficult to realize.</p>

<p>Three Parties to Negotiate the Construction of a Large Freight Depot at the North Station</p>
<p>Grain Industry Suggests</p>
<p>Postal Savings Bureau Invests</p>
<p>Road Bureau Leases</p>
<p>Shanghai Times News from This Port: The Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways Administration, in order to develop its business, greatly reduced the rent for the two railways' freight depots, changing the daily rent from five cents to one cent and five mills per ton. This was announced and implemented in June of this year. However, in recent months, business in Shanghai has declined, and grains stored in the warehouses have piled up like mountains and cannot be circulated. The Traffic Department had no choice but to notify the Grain Industry Association to restore the old price, hoping that customers would submit their goods as soon as possible. However, the Grain Industry Association, in this economic downturn, suddenly increased its burden by more than three times. It wrote to the two railways to express its opposition and sent Chairman Gu to negotiate in person. Now, Railway Director Huang Boqiao has agreed with Post Office Savings and Remittance Bureau Director Tang Baoshu to invest in the two railways to build a freight depot near the North Station as a fundamental solution. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Grain Industry Association's Reply Letter</p>
<p>Gu Xinyi, Chairman of the Grain Industry Association, sent a letter to the two railways yesterday, which read, "Respectfully, on November 4th, a letter was approved by the Traffic Department stating that the warehouses at the Maigen Road freight station of this railway were full of goods and could not be discharged. Now it is autumn, new goods are on the market, and foreign stations are continuously transporting them, but there is no warehouse space to stack them. Now, in order to clear the goods, the free storage period for goods at the station will be temporarily changed to five days from the 3rd of this month. In addition, the storage fee for all fourth-class and below goods will be temporarily charged according to the third-class goods storage rate, that is, zero-load will be calculated and charged per 50 kilograms (or less), and the whole car will be calculated and charged per ton (or less). We hereby inform you that we hope you will check and inform your colleagues, etc. With this, the loading and unloading of goods has been greatly facilitated. Therefore, the railway bureau's income has also increased sharply at the same time. This is a win-win situation. However, after only four months, the Traffic Department suddenly changed it again. Then, the original intention of the revision of the price at that time should be considered a temporary strategy to attract freight. In order to clear the accumulated goods, it is like abandoning food because of choking. Moreover, at this time when farmers and merchants are in trouble and the whole country is seeking to revitalize the countryside, reducing freight is regarded as an important plan. The Traffic Department has instead created this price increase for grains due to the full load of freight. No matter whether it is temporary or long-term, it should not be taken by your bureau. Therefore, we hereby inform you that we respectfully ask you to consider it and transfer it to the Traffic Department to develop other methods to clear the accumulated goods. The original situation should be maintained for grain transportation. We respectfully request a reply, etc. Sincerely, Gu Xin, Chairman of the Grain Industry Association, etc.</p>
<p>Adding Freight Depots to the North Station</p>
<p>During this period when the central government is seeking to clear the national grain and the Eight Provinces Grain Conference has also resolved to reduce freight rates, the authorities of the two railways suddenly took the initiative to increase the warehouse rent for grain, which is not a fundamental solution. After Gu Xinyi and others tried their best to negotiate, the railway bureau also believed that the fundamental solution was to add freight depots to seek clearance. However, it is not easy to raise funds for adding huge freight depots. The director of the two railways has discussed the results with Director Tang Baoshu of the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau, and it has been decided that the Savings and Remittance Bureau will invest in the two railways to build freight depots. Yesterday afternoon, Mo Heng, a representative of the two railways, and Xu Yuanfang, a representative of the Savings and Remittance Bureau, went to the Grain Industry Association with Gu Xinyi to discuss together and decided: (1) The two railways will relocate to a suitable location at the North Station for the construction of a huge freight depot. (2) The construction cost of the freight depot will be invested by the Savings and Remittance Bureau. (3) The freight depot must be able to accommodate at least 5,000 tons of goods. (4) Before the freight depot is built, a temporary freight depot capable of accommodating 5,000 tons will be built first. (5) After the temporary freight depot is successfully built, the previous warehouse rent will be restored. (6) After the Savings and Remittance Bureau has successfully built the depot, the Railway Bureau will rent it for use. If there are no goods to stack in the future, the Grain Industry Association will rent it as much as possible on its behalf to avoid losses, etc.</p>

<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Announces that the New Cultural Society Purchased Inferior Paper</p>
<p>The Paper Industry Association Officially Reports It</p>
<p>According to the New Sound Society, the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce announced the report of the Paper Industry Association that the New Cultural Society purchased inferior paper as follows:</p>
<p>Letter from the Paper Industry Association</p>
<p>Respectfully, according to the report of the Inspection Team of the Association, the team received a tip yesterday that the New Cultural Society in the Central Market of Fourth Road had a large number of Japanese newspaper paper entering the market and entrusted the Huawen Printing House at No. 3, Qirong Lane (i.e., No. 595 Lane), Huade Road, Liaoyang Road intersection, and the Sanmin Printing House at No. 3, Sanshou Lane, North End of Zhonghongqiao, Disui Road, to print ancient editions of books with new-style punctuation marks. Please stop them, etc. The team immediately sent personnel to investigate. The Huawen Printing House did have a stockpile of Japanese newspaper paper and took a copy of the Japanese newspaper paper "Feng Shen Zhuan Shu" that was being printed from Huawen. When asked, Huawen said that the Japanese paper was sent by the New Cultural Society. When they went to the Sanmin Printing House, they found no Japanese goods in storage. The team members also purchased a copy of "Liao Zhai Zhi Yi" printed in October of the 22nd year of the Republic of China from the New Cultural Society. The paper used for printing was indeed Japanese newspaper paper, which proved that what Huawen said was true, etc. According to this, our country's four provinces have not yet been recovered, and the blood and tears of Zhabei have not yet dried. Now, the New Cultural Society, which promotes culture, dares to purchase a large number of Japanese paper, which is really greedy and insane, and it is extremely hateful. Therefore, the evidence is specifically attached, including a stack of single pages of "Feng Shen Zhuan" printed on Japanese paper, a total of eight sheets, and</p>
<h3>Chiang Orders Six Provinces to Strictly Urge Powerful and Wealthy Families to Pay Overdue Taxes 丨丨 Follows Orders to Review and Reduce Surcharges 丨丨</h3>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: Chairman Chiang, considering that the surcharges on land taxes in various provinces are excessively high, exceeding the regular tax by several times, while the regular tax itself is decreasing daily, attributes the cause to powerful gentry and wealthy families defaulting on taxes as if they were exempt, while the weak and small people alone bear the heavy burden. This is a common problem in all provinces. In addition to having previously telegraphed eight provinces to earnestly review and reduce land tax surcharges, he has now telegraphed the chairmen and finance directors of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hubei, and Henan provinces to earnestly review and reduce land tax surcharges to alleviate the people's hardships. At the same time, he orders strict collection of overdue taxes from powerful and wealthy families to eliminate long-standing malpractices and increase tax revenue. The original telegram stated: "It has been found that in recent years, the surcharges on land taxes in various provinces have been excessively high, often exceeding the regular tax by several times, while at the same time, the fixed amount of land tax collected has been decreasing daily. The reason for this is that powerful gentry and wealthy families in various localities, landlords who own a large amount of land, mostly rely on their power to delay payment. Tax collectors dare not do anything about it, and local officials are also often afraid and accommodating. This has become a long-standing habit, virtually equivalent to exemption. Even their clansmen and relatives rely on their protection and take advantage of their power to resist tax collection, resulting in ever-increasing arrears and a great impact on tax revenue. Therefore, both the regular tax and surcharges are borne solely by the weak and small people who own little land, while the powerful and cunning do not participate. This phenomenon has become a common problem in almost all provinces, which is not only the source of local financial difficulties but also the main cause of rural bankruptcy and the people's distress. The provincial governments should immediately rectify and thoroughly reform this situation. On the one hand, the land tax surcharges should be earnestly reviewed and reduced in accordance with the telegram of □ day, without exceeding the ratio set by the Ministry of Finance, to alleviate the people's hardships. On the other hand, the amount and names of those in arrears for past years should be investigated, a deadline should be set, and strict collection should be enforced, without allowing arrears to accumulate. If there are still those who rely on their power to resist payment, public officials currently serving in the Party, government, or military should have their positions and titles in the central or local organs investigated, and a request should be made to dismiss them and order them to return the funds. If they are local gentry, they should be immediately arrested and severely punished. If their relatives and family members delay or resist payment, the relevant officials and gentry will be held accountable, and those who shield them will be punished for the same crime. If they fail to pay by the deadline, their property will be investigated and confiscated separately, or their land on which taxes are not paid will be confiscated to compensate. It is hoped that this will be strictly implemented with great efficiency. After the order is issued, if the county magistrate fears difficulties and acts leniently, failing to make effective efforts in collection, or if the provincial departments perfunctorily delay and do not take charge, they should be strictly investigated according to the circumstances, and their crimes should be discussed and judged separately. It is hoped that everyone will strictly abide by this and instruct their subordinates to comply as well." (November 14th)</p>
<h3>Inspection Report on Jiangxi, Anhui, Hunan, and Hubei Provinces By Our Special Correspondent, Ren An The Current Situation on the Xiangyang-Hankou Road and in Zaoyang</h3>
<p>Zaoyang Correspondence: Returning to Hankou from an inspection of eastern Hubei, I then made a trip to northern Hubei, taking the Pinghan Railway. Because I wanted to catch the Xiang(yang)-Hua(yuan) bus the next morning, I took the ordinary express train at 7:00 PM, from Han(kou) to Hua(yuan). The train was delayed by loading goods along the way, and only arrived at midnight. Although I could not see the scenery outside the window along the way, I did witness several scenes of tragedy, which are worth recounting.</p>
<p>The vehicles used this time were mostly old and dilapidated, and there were no doors connecting the cars. When checking tickets, the ticket inspector had to go up and down through the middle doors on both sides. Perhaps there were not enough personnel assigned. In the car I was in, there were only three ticket inspectors. Among the passengers, there was an old man from Henan who had failed to find work in Hankou and was returning to his hometown with his family. He was found to have no ticket and only produced two yuan and several jiao in coins, saying as he turned his pockets inside out, "I don't have a single copper coin left." The ticket inspector searched his body, and then his family. Suddenly, from a cigarette case, he poured out two or three yuan in banknotes. The ticket inspector quickly shone a flashlight on the ground, picked up the money, and hid it in his trouser pocket. The old man demanded it back but was unsuccessful and spoke inappropriately, and was slapped in the face by the ticket inspector, who said, "You said you didn't have a single copper coin, where did these banknotes come from?" Having said that, he did not issue a temporary ticket and turned away. In the next seat, I happened to meet a soldier with untidy clothes, who was asked to pay for a half-price ticket. The soldier seemed to have something to rely on and roared loudly, "If everyone here can get a half-price ticket, I will follow suit. Otherwise, I am not that old man, don't even think about bullying me again." Later, the ticket inspector ordered him to produce his passport, or he would be ordered off the train immediately. The soldier became enraged and punched the ticket inspector in the face, hitting him in the chest, and said, "Dare you look at my passport?" At that moment, the train arrived at Xiaogan, and they wrestled each other off the train. Then the passengers in the car began to discuss the matter loudly. A cotton merchant named Mr. Kong, who often traveled this route, claimed that the regulations on the Pinghan Railway were quite strict at first, but over time, they became lax and opened up loopholes. Once, when he was traveling south on this route, he saw several soldiers walking back and forth in the car, whispering to passengers. Later, they brought several sets of military uniforms and put them on the passengers, and even mixed one or two people without military uniforms among them. When the ticket inspector arrived, the soldier would simply say, "These passengers are under my care," or "Newly recruited soldiers." The ticket inspector would then nod silently and leave. However, the passengers who temporarily wore military uniforms or mixed in with military uniforms still had to secretly prepare half the ticket price to give to the soldier who was taking care of them and the ticket inspector who nodded silently. "They work together to share the spoils, deceiving only the public," he said. Another passenger whispered, "Half-price tickets for soldiers are a thing of the past. Now, not only do few people buy half-price tickets, but they even use military purposes as an excuse to transport retail goods. In terms of ticket inspection, there are also cases of issuing temporary tickets but forgetting to tear off the ticket stubs," and so on. Before long, a snoring adjutant suddenly announced that he had lost a hundred yuan in banknotes, and pointed to a soldier who he knew had the money as the biggest suspect. However, the soldier was sitting far away in another corner, and the two sides argued, almost leading to the final act. When the train arrived at the Huayuan station, it was a pity that I had to get off the train and did not get to see the whole picture.</p>
<p>The next morning, at 4:30 AM, I went from the train station to the bus station, passing through Hezhou, which was two or three li wide. The travelers walked in single file, groping forward in the dark night on the sandy beach, unable to distinguish the path, and following the porters. However, as the east gradually turned white, the sky gradually became brighter, and the morning exercises and bugle calls of the troops encamped on both banks were carried by the wind. When I arrived at the station, I saw several bungalows and inns, with recruiting flags slantedly inserted. Because the bus was used to transport both people and goods, the ride was particularly uncomfortable. Moreover, to guard against bandits, several buses traveled in convoy, stirring up dust and making breathing difficult. Passing through Luan and arriving at Suixian (that is, the State of Sui in the Spring and Autumn Period), a journey of two hundred and some li, the bus stopped to change goods. I took a trip to the city. The city has two layers of walls, an inner stone wall and an outer earth wall. The garrison troops are very strong. The city is home to the headquarters of the 34th Brigade, led by Brigadier Luo, who is known for his strict military orders, especially against opium smokers. Regardless of whether they are soldiers or civilians, they are killed if caught. Jiyang is about two hundred li away from here and is still within the brigade's defense area. However, a certain deputy brigade commander does not supervise the troops very strictly, and the discipline of the stationed troops is far inferior to this. There are about one hundred and some bandits in Suixian, who appear and disappear in the mountains and do not cause much harm. However, due to the terrain, there is a risk of robbery on the traffic between Sui and Zao. Recently, there have been two robberies of buses. The bandits, only three or five people, first fired shots to stop the bus, then overturned the boxes and baskets, and drove the passengers off the bus, strictly ordering them to hand over any hidden money, otherwise they would be shot if caught. Some passengers who had money left over, in order to save their lives, took it out from their collars, boots, and hats, and respectfully presented it to the bandits. Later, they drove the bus to a designated wilderness area. Only then did I return and sit on the roadside waiting for the passengers. On another occasion, the bandits disguised themselves as merchants, hid weapons, and when they reached a certain location, they threatened to stop the bus and did whatever they wanted. The bandits are mostly natives, making it difficult to detect them. The robberies have not killed or stripped people of their clothes. Stripping people of their clothes in the winter would freeze them to death, which is still a sign of some conscience not being completely extinguished. When the rear bus continued west to Zaoyang from Suixian, it was seen that escort teams had been added. White flags waved in the wind, tightly following each passenger and cargo bus. Moreover, when the bus started, the passengers were searched with extreme thoroughness, especially to prevent the carrying of weapons. As for whether they had passports or local goods, it seemed that no one cared. All the way, we passed through mountain slopes and highlands, which had been plagued by banditry and drought for years. The fields were desolate, and the dilapidated villages rarely showed signs of life. The residents were starving and cold, and many of them resorted to desperate measures. The endless cycle of banditry is probably not without reason.</p>
<p>Two years ago, Zaoyang County, outside the city walls, had almost completely fallen into the hands of the Red Army. Later, due to the efforts of the Independent 34th Brigade in stationing and suppressing the bandits, the people in the rear provided supplies, and the soldiers were encouraged to fight bravely, the bandit areas were gradually recovered. However, because the area is adjacent to southern Henan, large groups of Henan bandits often come to the border to harass the area. Moreover, because of the two disasters of banditry and drought, bad causes have been created, so sporadic small bandits and robberies on the main roads still occur from time to time. Moreover, these local bandits are more difficult to defend against than the large Henan bandits, because they are natives and like attached bones, coming out at night and hiding during the day, making suppression and pacification very difficult. Recently, when cotton was put on the market, many cotton merchants passing through the nearby city walls were robbed. The county government has offered a reward to encourage people to capture and kill them. The reward is 400 yuan for capturing them alive on the spot, 200 yuan for reporting and arresting them, and 100 yuan for killing them and providing proof. The opium scourge in northern Hubei has recently spread again. The county has an opium rehabilitation center, and the districts have opium rehabilitation sub-centers. Opium addicts pay a rehabilitation fee of one yuan per month, and the number of addicts is only allowed to decrease, not increase. In practice, the result is the opposite. Sellers pay a special tax, the amount of which is based on the prosperity of their business, generally ranging from dozens to hundreds of yuan per month. Other peculiar customs will be described later.</p>
<h3>The Gengkuan (Boxer Indemnity) Funds Organizations Decide on Various Matters Recently Convened by the Executive Yuan All Matters Have Been Submitted to the National Government for Record</h3>
<p>The Executive Yuan convened a meeting of various Gengkuan funds organizations on the 6th of this month, and resolved three issues regarding the budget formulation process, two issues regarding reimbursement and review, and six issues regarding cooperation among Gengkuan funds organizations. A report was submitted to the Yuan meeting on the 14th and was approved, and reported to the National Government for record. A letter was sent to the Secretariat of the Political Council for forwarding, and separate orders were sent to the relevant agencies to implement them. The original text is recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>The West District Property Appraisal Table Has Been Printed</h3>
<p>The property appraisal table for the West District of the Public Concession has been printed and contains the registered numbers, land numbers, and assessed values of the properties in the district, as well as an attached map. Those wishing to purchase it may contact the Donation Collection Office of the Public Concession at 209 Jiangxi Road.</p>
<h3>Sanitary Conditions in the International Settlement</h3>
<p>The acting director of the Health Department of the Public Concession reported in October that the general public health was the same as in September. There were no special issues to note, except for the death of a child in a family due to smallpox after refusing vaccination. There has been a significant increase in cases of diphtheria in children, and parents and school authorities should pay attention. Scarlet fever should also not be ignored. In general, attention should be paid to sore throats during this season.</p>
<p>Mortality Statistics: The mortality rate for foreigners this month was 8.42 per thousand, and for Chinese, it was 13.30 per thousand, both lower than the previous month. The reported births were 55 for foreigners and 111 for Chinese.</p>
<p>Infectious Diseases: Smallpox is usually found when the weather turns cold. There were six cases this month. Diphtheria and scarlet fever were more common in foreigners, but there were no deaths. Scarlet fever was less common in Chinese than in foreigners, and deaths were extremely rare. The number of gastrointestinal cases in foreigners was particularly high. According to the reports of health inspectors, the neglect of general kitchens is a disgrace to civilized people.</p>
<p>Pathological Research: The Pathological Research Laboratory performed 1,824 routine tests, of which 3,996 showed a positive reaction. There were 422 cases related to dysentery. For epidemic prevention work, 1,472 animals were inspected. 59 samples of milk were tested, and 30 samples of tap water were tested, collected from various places within the concession. In addition, 295 chemical analysis tests were performed.</p>
<p>Rabies Treatment: The rabies clinic had 54 patients, of whom 11 came from other cities. 43 of them were advised to receive treatment, 17 completed treatment, 17 were given preventive treatment, and 9 left without completing treatment. A Chinese boy, 11 years old, only came for treatment 17 days after being bitten by a dog. Although he was treated, he eventually died in the isolation hospital.</p>
<p>Vaccination: The vaccination season started on October 1st, and a total of 48,661 people were vaccinated this month. Factory owners who wish to have their workers vaccinated can contact the Health Department, which can work at the factory. Call extension 23 of phone number 12410 for contact.</p>
<p>Food Situation: Milk production increased by more than 4% compared to the previous month. The supply of meat, the number of cattle, sheep, and pigs slaughtered all increased. This is a common phenomenon. More than 17 tons of meat were discarded, and six carcasses were sent to Maohai Road for incineration. The disturbance of tea vendors in various vegetable markets has been cracked down on. 150 cases of violations have been prosecuted. The supply of vegetables is about the same as usual.</p>
<p>Cleaning Work: Vaccination and rat catching work are both quite busy. Many unauthorized thatched sheds were found in the West District and have been removed with the cooperation of the Public Works Department. Canned food with rotten soil was found in a certain auction house. The operation of this type of business must be subject to the restriction of obtaining a license to protect public health.</p>
<p>Applications for Subsidies: Most of the schools that applied for subsidies have been inspected and are generally satisfactory. However, there are also some schools that have not been able to comply despite instructions and guidance. However, what the Health Department requires is the minimum facilities for the health of students.</p>
<h3>The National Products Association Introduces Leather Coats and Hats Suitable for Use by Maritime and Aviation Personnel</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Citizens' National Products Promotion Association believes that this year is the "National Products Year," and factories and craftsmen are working hard to imitate and vigorously produce various new crafts and manufactured goods, which are increasing day by day, making a great contribution to the national movement. However, it is regrettable that the promotion is weak and the publicity is not widespread, making it difficult to achieve the practical effect of universal promotion. The association has been designing relief measures and striving to provide support. In recent days, it has sent personnel to various member factories to conduct on-site investigations and careful assessments. Once the investigation and assessment are completed, if the products are found to be exquisite, beneficial, and practical, the association is responsible for publicizing them in newspapers, introducing them in letters, and promoting the attention of the entire population. This promotes the sales of new national products, in line with the purpose of promoting cooperation between production and sales, and using goods to offset goods. Because the newly produced leather raincoats and hats of the Yuanda Leather Factory meet the needs of people in the maritime and aviation industries, the association sent letters to the Ministry of the Navy and the Aviation Administration yesterday, requesting them to promote and try them out to support national products. The original letter is recorded as follows (omitted above):</p>
<p>Case: Yuanda Leather Factory, a member of our association, stated in a letter that its latest leather coats and hats are soft in texture and novel in style, and are suitable for use by maritime and aviation personnel. Whether it is rain, wind, snow, or severe winter, once worn, the body will warm up, and they are lightweight and comfortable, without hindering work. The camel hair lining, whether leather or single-layer, can be installed and removed at any time, meeting the needs of spring, autumn, and winter. They are especially economical clothing with unique features. At the beginning of the launch, the price is particularly low, but the association is afraid that the publicity is not widespread and the promotion will be difficult to popularize. Therefore, it specifically requested our association to widely introduce them. It is believed that your department has a unique intention in using national products. The products are practical and suitable for actual application. It is appropriate to send a letter to enthusiastically promote and widely adopt them. The national economy and the people's livelihood will benefit greatly.</p>
<h3>The Haijingbo Circus Performs a Charity Show to Help with Flood Relief</h3>
<p>The Haijingbo Circus has agreed to perform a charity show next Tuesday (the 21st) to help with the Yellow River flood relief. The proceeds from the tickets sold for both the daytime and evening shows on that day will be donated to the Yellow River Flood Relief Committee. This year, the Yellow River has flooded extensively, and those who are in the affected area and have lost their property and have nowhere to go are countless. The Yellow River Flood Relief Committee has been trying its best to rescue the victims. However, relief requires huge sums of money. The committee members consulted with the manager of the Haijingbo Circus, who is known for his philanthropy and good reputation. The circus immediately agreed to sponsor the event. The daytime show on Tuesday will still start at 5:30 PM, and the evening show will start at 9:15 PM. Each performance will have 20 scenes, the same as usual. This is a matter of charity, and it is hoped that the audience will cooperate and come together. This is what the committee and the circus hope for.</p>
<h3>The Social Bureau Cracks Down on Deceptive Advertising</h3>
<p>The Municipal Social Bureau has found that there are unscrupulous people in the city who are falsely claiming to be foreign firms and using extremely low prices to pre-sell a large number of socially needed goods, water heaters. The proceeds of the sales will be used to organize self-rescue funds, a free one-yuan discount, and a free wool sweater for one yuan per item. After investigation by the personnel sent by the Social Bureau, it was discovered that the advertisements were published by unscrupulous people. The investigation is still ongoing. The Social Bureau received letters from the citizens, asking the Social Bureau to investigate the incidents and to enforce the law severely. The incidents are in accordance with the law of the second clause and fourth item in the advertisement regulation, which dictates that "it is illegal to entice and deceive in order to defraud people of money." The Social Bureau has sent a letter to newspapers to stop these advertisements. The Social Bureau hopes that people in the mainland will learn from their mistakes and not be fooled by such schemes.</p>

<p>The Chinese Yaple Electric Appliance Factory, in view of the advancements in modern machinery, and in order to strive for the extraordinary excellence of the factory's products, spared no expense to gradually replace all kinds of machinery in the factory with the latest modern machinery. One month ago, it first dismantled the half-bubble (gas bubble) manufacturing machine and completely replaced it with a new machine. It is expected that the installation can be completed in another four weeks. Recently, due to the import and manufacture of half-bubbles, the stock has been sold out one after another, so that it often cannot fully meet the needs of customers. According to the person in charge of the factory, after all the machines in the factory are replaced with new machines in the future, the products can be guaranteed to be even more exquisite.</p>

<h3>Zhao Lin's Sentence Reduced After Appeal</h3>
<p>Zhao Lin from Shandong, on May 21, 1928, at 9:00 AM, along with the fugitive Jin A San, also known as Wang San, both carrying pistols, broke into Room 19 of the Guangtailai Hotel on Fa Da Ma Road, and shot and killed Liu Yunqi (also known as Shouming) from Guangxi, an official of the Political Training Office of the 33rd Division of the Seventh Army of the National Revolutionary Army. When fleeing, Zhao was caught by Chinese and foreign detectives from the French Concession and sent to the former French Public Concession, where he was sentenced to five years in the Western Prison, and after the term expired, he was sent to the inland government for trial. Zhao served his sentence in prison. In September of this year, after the five-year term expired, Zhao was transferred from the Special No. 2 Prison to the Second Special District Court for review and was sentenced to 18 years in prison for the crimes of jointly conspiring to murder and attempted murder (for shooting and wounding the Western police chief while resisting arrest at the time). Zhao refused to accept the verdict and hired lawyer Zhu Dianqing to file an appeal with the Third Branch of the Jiangsu High Court. The details have been recorded in previous reports. The High Court has completed the trial. Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, Judge Guo Deting, along with two judges, Sun and Li, opened the court and ruled that the original verdict was revoked, and Zhao Lin was sentenced to seven years of imprisonment for joint murder. The number of days spent in custody will be counted as part of the sentence. After the verdict, the appellant was still returned to the detention center to await instructions.</p>
<h3>Robbers with Painted Faces Rob Xu Songmao's Family Wealth, Xu's Wife Faints in Bed, Losses of Two to Three Hundred Yuan</h3>
<p>Xu Songcang, a resident of No. 33 Chenjiatou in Hongzhen, north of Shanghai, and his son You Sheng, both conduct business in the concession. At home are only Xu's wife, grandson, and daughter-in-law. Yesterday morning at 7:00 AM, six or seven robbers suddenly arrived. Three robbers held handguns, and two held knives and axes, breaking into the house through the back door. Three or four robbers stood guard outside the door. They first kicked open the door of a tenant, a rural woman, and searched and looted her room. The rural woman earned her living through farming and had no money, foreign clothes, or belongings. The robbers then went to Xu's wife's room to search and loot. Xu's wife, frightened, fainted on the bed, letting the robbers rummage through boxes and chests. In total, clothing and jewelry worth about two to three hundred silver dollars were stolen. As the robbers left, they fired a shot and fled. The location was relatively far from the police station, so the robbers were calm and unhurried. After Xu Songmao received the news and returned home, he checked the lost items and filed a report with the Fifth District's Third Precinct, requesting an investigation. Precinct Chief Wen immediately dispatched Patrol Officer Lin Jing from the Hongzhen sub-station, along with police officers Gao Yucheng, Shen Hongbin, etc., to surround and apprehend the robbers. However, because too much time had passed, the robbers had already fled far away. They returned to Xu's house to investigate. According to Xu's wife, three of the robbers were wearing blue cloth shirts and pants, without hats, and had black ash smeared on their faces, all speaking in a local accent. I was frightened when I saw them, so I fainted on the bed and covered myself with a blanket. According to the tenants, the robbers were carrying handguns about a foot long, all with painted faces. Patrol Officer Lin observed that the robbers were clearly aware that Xu Songmao and his son were not at home, so they painted their faces to commit the robbery. It was undoubtedly done by someone from the vicinity. After completing the investigation, he returned to the station to report and immediately submitted a report to the General Bureau, issuing a general order for coordinated apprehension.</p>

<h3>Assistance in Bigamy Case: Both Parties Fail to Appear, Extension of Seven Days Granted</h3>
<p>Bi Fengsheng, a native of Changzhou, worked as a plasterer. Three years ago, he married Quan Xiaomei, a woman from Yixing. Xiaomei was of marriageable age and had some beauty. After marrying Bi, they initially lived in harmony. However, because Bi's income was meager and could not afford Xiaomei's extravagant spending, quarrels gradually increased, and their relationship deteriorated. Xiaomei left without notice in January of this year and became involved with Jin Liuzhen. But Jin was a rogue with no stable job or interests, and their life was very difficult. At that time, Gu Quan'gen, a craftsman from Wuxi at the Shuntai Machinery Can Factory at No. 305 Lane Dalian Bay Road, was 23 years old and still single, looking for a woman to marry. Jin Liugen learned of this and colluded with his friends Wu Shaoxian and Qiu Binghua to act as matchmakers. They falsely claimed that Xiaomei was Liugen's younger sister and willing to marry Gu as his wife. They agreed on a bride price of 140 yuan and chose July 17th to hold the wedding at the Taihe Restaurant. Two days after the wedding, Bi Fengsheng, Xiaomei's original husband, learned of this and reported it to the police, who arrested Xiaomei and handed her over to the First Special District Court. The court sentenced Xiaomei to five months in prison for bigamy and sent her to jail. Gu Quangen then hired lawyer Yu Hualong to file a lawsuit in the First Special District Court, accusing Wu and Shen of knowingly assisting in bigamy, defrauding and obtaining money, and requesting the court to summon the defendants to court and punish them according to the law, citing Article 254 of the Criminal Law for assisting in bigamy and Article 361 of the same law for defrauding and obtaining money. He also filed a civil lawsuit, demanding that the defendants jointly compensate the plaintiff for the 140 yuan bride price and other losses of over 180 yuan. The court approved the request, and Judge Xue opened a hearing yesterday afternoon. Neither the plaintiff nor the defendant appeared in court. Only the plaintiff's attorney, Yu Hualong, appeared in court and requested an extension. Judge Xue ordered that the case be postponed for seven days for further hearing.</p>

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>To the Editor: I have been instructed by my client, Yin Qiulian, to state that I recently read in today's newspaper an article entitled "Unexpectedly Admits to Being a Citizen of the Puppet State," which is not in accordance with the facts. Qiulian has lived abroad since childhood and is not familiar with the language of this country. Therefore, during the court hearing, she requested the judge to allow her to present her case in English. When the judge asked Qiulian where she was from, Qiulian immediately replied that she was born in Fengtian. However, the word "Munden" was mistakenly translated by the interpreter as Manchuria, leading to a great misunderstanding and error. Qiulian shares the same grief and indignation over the loss of our national territory. She is not insane and would never admit to being a citizen of the puppet state. I am commissioned to correct this statement. Respectfully submitted to the Shen Bao, Lawyers Song Chunfang and Jiang Zongpan, November 16th.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Education Invited Ms. Fry to Speak on British Education Yesterday</h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 16th dispatch) The Ministry of Education invited British Ms. Fry to give a lecture on British education at 5:00 PM on the 16th. More than 100 people attended, including staff from the Ministry of Education and members of the Sino-British Cultural Association. Minister Wang gave a welcoming speech. Fry said that British education emphasizes autonomy and has now eliminated class concepts. There are two paths to university, and both the poor and the rich can attend. The government encourages donations to support education. In recent years, private schools have sprung up, and funding has increased. Primary and secondary schools have implemented moral education for many years. Religious concepts vary, so educational methods also vary. There is no need to force uniformity. Universities especially emphasize the preservation of each person's unique personality. Tuition fees account for one-tenth or two-tenths of university funding. Government subsidies to universities and private establishments coexist and harmonize with each other. The government does not interfere with university administration due to subsidies to private schools, but the standards for university degrees are very strict. Many university students serve on the faculty, which allows them to interact with teachers. I have observed that Chinese university professors are responsible for educating students, which is very similar to Britain. China's education has recently improved, young people are intelligent, and teachers are well-trained. This impression is the best souvenir I will take with me upon my departure. Wang Shijie believed that Ms. Fry's speech was a good reference for educators in our country and expressed his gratitude. In the evening, the Sino-British Cultural Association hosted a tea party with refreshments to welcome the guests. More than 20 Sino-British members, including Wang Shijie, Shi Ying, and Zhang Daofan, attended, and the guests and hosts enjoyed themselves.</p>

<h3>The Joint Association of Middle School Teachers Sends a Telegram Comforting the Soldiers Suppressing Bandits</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Middle School Teachers' Joint Association sent a telegram yesterday comforting the soldiers suppressing bandits, saying: "To Chairman Jiang of Nanchang, to all the soldiers suppressing bandits, The Red bandits are a scourge to the country and the people, and their crimes are heinous, especially harming the youth, which is unforgivable. Thanks to the brave attacks of the generals and soldiers, good news is frequently reported, which is inspiring to the whole country. The bankruptcy of China's rural economy and the daily deterioration of people's livelihoods can be traced back to the fact that the Red bandits have not been completely wiped out. Under the current situation, national salvation cannot be achieved without exterminating the Red bandits, and there is no way to complete the great cause of national construction. Our association, uniting the faculty and staff of all middle schools in Shanghai, in addition to paying tribute to all the generals, expresses our condolences and vows to work together with one heart to follow the principle of 'pacifying the interior before resisting foreign aggression', exterminating the Red bandits and protecting our nation. This is our telegram. We hope you will understand. Sincerely, The Shanghai Middle School Teachers' Joint Association."</p>

<h3>Municipal Tangpan Primary School Holds Dedication Ceremony for New Building</h3>
<p>Since Ms. Zhang Mei became the principal of Tangpan Primary School in Pudong, the school has made remarkable achievements in a short period of time and has long been praised by local people. Therefore, the number of students has reached more than 300. The original school building had long been insufficient to accommodate them. However, at a time when the country was in trouble and municipal finances were stretched, it was difficult to add new buildings. The principal deeply felt the suffering of students who could not go to school. Therefore, amidst all the difficulties, she did not hesitate to work hard and personally raised funds for a new building to benefit the local students. Construction began in the new year and was completed in the summer. It has now been decided that a dedication ceremony for the new building will be held on the 19th of this month during the school's achievement exhibition. It is reported that famous people have been invited to give speeches on that day, and educational films will be shown in the evening to entertain the guests. It is expected that there will be a grand occasion at that time.</p>

<h3>General Overview of Modern Chinese Education Thought (III) - Narrated by Shu Jincheng - Notes by Sun Yucai - ▲ Factors Contributing to New Educational Thought</h3>
<p>If China, eighty years ago, had not experienced the Opium War, even if it had engaged in commerce with foreign countries, I believe it would have been at most a matter of fair trade in the international market. China's social phenomena would definitely not be as they are now, and there would be even less talk of new education. Furthermore, if after the Opium War, the nation had prospered, establishing itself as a world power, if China had not been defeated by Japan, or if the Boxer Rebellion had truly succeeded in driving out the "foreigners," I think China's current education system might still be following the scientific and academy systems that have been passed down for thousands of years. Perhaps some country in the world would even admire the excellence of our nation's system and resolutely imitate it. Truly, the emergence and formation of all systems cannot be separated from the driving force of the environment. The adoption of China's new education system was entirely forced by external forces. In the twenty-eighth year of the Guangxu reign (Qing Dynasty), when Zhang Baixi presented and enacted the Regulations for Schools, he completely abolished the old system in one stroke and transplanted the education system of Western industrial society in its entirety. The fundamental reason for this can be summarized in the four characters "forced by circumstances." In the past sixty years, the emergence of new educational thought in China, while primarily due to international trends, was also jointly promoted by various special backgrounds in our nation's domestic politics, society, world, and academia.</p>
<p>In the past sixty years, China, due to the oppression of international capital imperialism, has suffered from social poverty and financial exhaustion, political fragmentation, and academic plagiarism. Almost nothing is satisfactory. However, within these various unsatisfactory phenomena, there is still a hint of latent progress. This progress is "self-awareness." This widespread self-awareness is truly a characteristic of recent decades. China's survival depends on this self-awareness. In the past sixty years, educational thought, though undergoing various changes due to environmental shifts, is still fundamentally progressing in self-awareness. This is the general principle of modern Chinese educational thought.</p>
<p>▲ History of Changes in Modern Educational Thought Table</p>
<p>Modern educational thought, while moving towards self-awareness, varies greatly in degree. Initially, it was passive and imitative; now, it is active and creative. If we distinguish by time, then the educational thought of the late Qing Dynasty was imitative, while the educational thought since the Republic of China has been self-aware. Within each period, there can be further subdivisions, as shown in the table below.</p>
<p>History of Changes in Modern Chinese Educational Thought</p>
<p>Imitative Period (Qing Dynasty) (Foreign Language Thought, Military Preparation Thought, Western Learning Thought, Western Art Thought, Western Political Thought)</p>
<p>Self-Awareness Period (Republic of China) (Military Nationalism and Military Education Thought, Pragmatism and Practical Thought, Aesthetic Thought, Great Harmony Thought, Vocational Thought, Democratic Governance Thought, Educational Establishment Thought, Scientific Thought, Non-Religious Thought)</p>
<p>(National Thought, Civic Thought, Party-Oriented Thought, Production Education Thought, Rural Education Thought, Mass Education Thought, National Revival Education Thought, Women's Education Thought)</p>
<p>By briefly reviewing the above table, we can understand the general outline of the history of changes in thought. Now, let's delve into the details. For the sake of convenience in explanation, I will specifically divide the many complex thoughts above into five periods for separate explanation.</p>
<p>(I) The "Chinese Learning for Foundation, Western Learning for Application" Period (Opium War to Late Guangxu Reign)</p>
<p>Educational thought changes with social thought and shifts with the trends of the times. This is a consensus we have all reached. After the Opium War, China's various weaknesses were exposed to the outside world. Britain, France, and other countries then came one after another to sign unequal treaties, taking the opportunity to bully us. Consular jurisdiction, equal sharing of benefits, missionary travel, and other matters were all separately stipulated by treaties. As foreigners could freely move deep into the interior, interactions between Chinese and Western peoples became more frequent. Foreigners often relied on the rights granted by unequal treaties, frequently engaging in actions that bullied officials and insulted the people, leading to an increasing number of diplomatic incidents. Because of this, China's educational thought at the time turned entirely towards imitating Westernization. Thus, the saying "Chinese learning for foundation, Western learning for application" became popular. What does this phrase mean? It means using China's inherent culture and scholarship as the foundation and system, while learning and practically applying Western culture and scholarship. It implies promoting Western culture without forgetting the essence of Chinese culture. Naturally, "adopting the strengths of others to compensate for one's own weaknesses" is an eternal principle. Moreover, the situation in our country at the time precisely required Western learning to the extreme. We can divide this period into five aspects for explanation.</p>
<p>▲ Foreign Language Education Thought In the first year of the Tongzhi reign, the Zongli Yamen (Office for Foreign Affairs) recognized that international diplomatic matters were becoming increasingly frequent. Countries such as Britain, France, Russia, America, Sweden, and Norway had successively signed treaties and engaged in commerce. Therefore, it took the lead in advocating the establishment of the Tongwen Guan (School of Combined Learning) in Beijing. Foreign language education thought thus began from this point. In the second year of the Tongzhi reign, Li Hongzhang requested the establishment of the Guangfangyan Guan (School for Broad Language Studies) in Shanghai. In the third year, Ruilin and others also requested the establishment of the Guangdong Tongwen Guan in Guangzhou. All these schools primarily focused on teaching languages and writing. Before the twenty-eighth year of the Guangxu reign, these three schools were truly the institutions of higher education in China's new education system, especially with the Tongwen Guan in Beijing serving as the central hub. Its content can be divided into three major categories: first, cultivating diplomatic talent; second, translating Western books; third, requiring all schools above the secondary level to study foreign languages. Its influences included the emergence of diplomatic talent, the translation of Western and Japanese books, and so on. Later, due to the promotion of missionary schools and the fueling of the student-abroad system, the means gradually became the end.</p>
<p>▲ Military Preparation Education Thought After the Treaty of Nanjing, almost everything was subject to foreign constraints. Statesmen realized that the foreigners' victory over our country was by no means accidental but was backed by their strong armor and sharp weapons. If our country truly wanted to strengthen itself, it would not be enough to simply have diplomatic talent capable of negotiating. It was necessary to "use their ways to deal with their own people." Therefore, after the establishment of the Tongwen Guan and other schools, there followed the emergence of military preparation thought. At the time, the court and the public alike shared a desire for self-strengthening, and their understanding of Western countries focused solely on their strong armor and sharp weapons. Therefore, military preparation became the center of educational thought at the time. Whether it was studying abroad or establishing schools domestically, the goal was invariably to strengthen the military. This thought, starting from the establishment of the Tongwen Guan and lasting until the twenty-eighth year of the Guangxu reign, spanned over forty years. It was truly at its peak, and its influence was not insignificant. For example, establishing military factories, translating Western books, establishing naval and military academies, sending students abroad to specialize in the army, and adding military drills to the curriculum of various schools. The greatest impact was the establishment of the foundation for military nationalist education in modern Chinese educational thought.</p>
<p>▲ Western Learning Education Thought After the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895, our country suffered greatly. The entire nation was eager to become stronger as a major task. Therefore, the trend of Western learning flourished for a time. After the Boxer Rebellion in 1900, the implementation of the new education system popularized Western learning throughout the general education circles. Tracing the origins of this thought, the only reason was still foreign aggression. The scope of Western learning initially encompassed astronomy and mathematics. Later, it gradually became more diverse, narrowly referring only to natural sciences and broadly referring to all Western culture. Western learning education thought spanned over sixty years. During these sixty years, almost all aspects of Chinese politics and academics were directly or indirectly influenced by it. The most prominent were: first, the addition of astronomy and mathematics departments to the Tongwen Guan in the fifth year of the Tongzhi reign; second, the various Sino-Western schools established after the Reform Movement of 1898 and before the Boxer Rebellion; third, the science subjects in schools at all levels after the implementation of the new education system; fourth, the absorption of Western culture.</p>
<p>▲ Western Art Education Thought Western art was originally a part of Western learning. After the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895, Western learning thought advanced further, and natural sciences and applied sciences were separately established as Western art. Its emergence was also due to the reflection of foreign powers' strong armor and sharp weapons, and its development was due to the lack of practical application in the new education of the late Qing Dynasty. The most important achievements were: first, the recognition of the driving force of Western material civilization; second, the development of industrial schools; third, the gradual breakdown of the concept of "learning for what purpose"; fourth, the extension from recognizing the advantages of Western technology to valuing Western skills. It is a pity that most of the facilities for establishing industrial schools and studying abroad were merely empty words. Therefore, for decades, China's technology did not make any significant progress due to Western art education thought.</p>
<p>▲ Western Political Education Thought After our country was influenced by the Japanese Meiji Restoration, everyone knew that Western learning contained extremely complex elements. Therefore, a part of the arts and skills was named Western art, and a part of politics was called Western politics. After Western art and Western politics were separated, Western political education received special attention from the people. Because at the beginning of the reform, everything was waiting to be done. Without talented and decisive leaders in political talent, almost everything would be difficult to accomplish, and there was no way to talk about skills. However, Western political education thought was very short-lived, lasting only for more than ten years from the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895 to the end of the Qing Dynasty. In its positive aspects, its greatest impact was: first, the absorption of Western culture; second, the establishment of the Republic of China. Therefore, the practical impact of Western political education was indeed very significant. At the same time, it also bore a particularly large responsibility for the various negative phenomena in Chinese politics and society for decades.</p>

<h3>The Whip</h3>
<p>— Xianxian</p>
<p>Anyone who has seen a Hae Chin Po circus probably won't forget the whip that can be used to demonstrate power and subdue dragons and tigers.</p>
<p>Wild beasts, no matter how tamed, can never escape their wild nature. Although willing to work hard, wild beasts are willing to work for their masters, but sometimes they can become feral and make trouble for their masters, refusing to perform. But when they hear the master crack the whip in his hand, emitting one or two strange sounds that make the hair stand on end, they will naturally obey the master's command with their heads bowed.</p>
<p>Thus, I have developed a great admiration for the whip. Maintaining order requires the whip. Not only are whips necessary for wild beasts, but also for people to people, and even more so for civilized people to barbaric peoples. However, people use a formal "whip" for wild beasts, while people use the spirit of the "whip" or a means beyond the "whip" for each other.</p>
<p>Black slaves, in the eyes of white people, are no different from the wild beasts in a circus. To maintain order among blacks, a whip should be in hand, otherwise, blacks will surely become feral and disturb the peace of whites. Therefore, although blacks have been liberated, "blacks" are ultimately different from "whites."</p>
<p>It is not just that blacks are different from whites. All colored people in the world, except for Japan, should be subjected to a few whips from the white race. Therefore, the United States invented the Monroe Doctrine, Africa was divided among several European powers, and six or seven tenths of Asia is also dealt with by white people who have means beyond the "whip" to deal with colored people who have evolved from wild beasts.</p>
<p>The maintenance of peace in East Asia must naturally be attributed to the whip of the Japanese Empire. Indeed, in East Asia, there is a great sleeping lion that has never roared. If this great sleeping lion wants to open its eyes, in order to maintain peace in East Asia, the whip in the master's hand will emit strange sounds to command it to sleep. In recent days, the whip that commands the sleeping lion has also been moved to train a European bear. I wonder if the next great circus can sell out again in Geneva.</p>
<h3>Victim</h3>
<p>— Tongchu</p>
<p>This morning, before I even washed my face, a school servant brought news: "A baby has been abandoned on the wall across the street." What does a discarded baby look like? Driven by curiosity, I dragged a colleague along, even though I hadn't washed my face.</p>
<p>In a metropolis, this is not considered a rare event; but after all, it is a child, after all, it is an abnormal act, abandoning one's own child. A crowd had already gathered, and when I saw the "abandoned baby," my chest felt a severe pressure, and I was breathing heavily.</p>
<p>Wrapped in red swaddling clothes, his small face was revealed in the white felt; his eyes were closed, his mouth did not move, and his face was flushed. I didn't know if it was the tension of the blood after his cries, or a symbol of what is called a blood child. Those who watched did not say a word, and I only heard the faint sound of tongues and teeth moving: "Tsk! Tsk! Tsk! Tsk!" filling the air, creating a terrible and strange scene. In this situation, there are at least two things that deserve our attention.</p>
<p>First. The key to women's liberation is that chastity is still the second life of women in today's society. Otherwise, would the mother of the abandoned baby have the heart to abandon him? Women's liberation, demanding freedom and equality, has been chanted for a long time, and on the surface, everything has been achieved. But the facts show us that, except for a few, who does not depend on men? Because they depend on men, there are such heartbreaking things. Therefore, true women's liberation still needs to find a foothold economically.</p>
<p>Second. Sexual life urgently needs to be improved properly. Few people talk about this issue, as if it is not worth mentioning. But the facts are there. The matter of seeking pleasure in brothels has been countless throughout history. The authority of the law cannot suppress them, and society and public opinion cannot subdue them, giving them more victories and sacrificing their crystallization. Alas! That crystallization is not a private thing, the sacrifice is still social. Hereafter, I deeply hope that enlightened people will study it and find a proper way to improve it.</p>

<h3>Crying for Uncle Yi</h3>
<p>— Shouou</p>
<p>One day after the Double Ninth Festival, a friend from the French Concession came and told me, "Your uncle, Mr. Yiqing, has passed away!" When I heard this, I lowered my head and said nothing. The friend repeated, "He passed away more than a month ago! Don't you know?" I still said nothing, because I didn't know what to say. After a long time, I began to say, "I suppose it was because the family had just moved that I didn't receive the news. But I already knew that he would not be willing to linger in this muddy world. Now that I hear what you say, it matches what I expected, so it's not surprising, but my heart is still inevitably heavy."</p>
<p>Uncle Yi's surname was Wu, his given name was Zonglian, and Yiqing was his style name. In the late Qing Dynasty, he was once an envoy to Italy, Britain, and France, and was a predecessor in our country's diplomatic circles. I suppose many people know him.</p>
<p>However, in addition to being proficient in English and French, my uncle rarely had the demeanor of today's diplomats. His words and actions were extremely sincere, like a village scholar. Therefore, although he traveled as an official for more than ten years, reaching the highest rank, his purse remained as tight as ever. However, when relatives and friends asked for help, he would not hesitate to reduce his own expenses to help them. Later, after he retired from official life, there were those who came to him for help. Although he had nothing to give, he still tried his best to find ways, not shying away from hard work and complaints. Whenever someone asked him to be a guarantor, he would agree without hesitation, so he was often implicated and had to repay debts for others. However, after only a few days, he would be a guarantor for someone else. I once heard him say, "People would not be willing to disregard their reputation and burden the guarantor unless they had no choice. When they asked me to be a guarantor, they did not intend to burden me, so how can I refuse them!" His loyalty and kindness were like this.</p>
<p>Uncle also liked to act like Cao Qiu, helping relatives and party members who were unemployed, even if they did not ask him. However, those in power today are mostly snobbish. Even if they had a deep friendship with Uncle in the past, they now know that he has lost power. Therefore, people who hold letters from Uncle to visit officials rarely succeed. When Uncle heard about this, he would angrily exclaim, "Human feelings are thinner than autumn clouds!"</p>
<p>In recent years, my uncle has been too enthusiastic. He has paid too much for others, and his finances have become extremely tight. Those who are unworthy often fabricate rumors and ridicule him in various ways, even making things difficult for him to his face. Therefore, the old man's hidden pain deepened day by day, and his spirit gradually weakened. Now he is indeed gone! But he lived to be over ninety years old, which is a blessing from heaven to a kind and honest person, not something that could be achieved by taking ginseng and deer velvet every day.</p>
<h3>The Heart of the Chinese</h3>
<p>— Yan Bokuang</p>
<p>I remember seeing F'kiein's "The Heart of the Chinese" in a certain Western magazine. He said: "The heart of the Chinese is obviously different from that of Westerners: (1) They have no creative mind, (2) They harbor a fluke mentality, (3) They have no patriotism, (4) They harbor a destructive mind." The way he said it was as if he had X-ray glasses on his eyes, seeing through the crux of the matter. But do we Chinese really have the above mentality? Readers might as well think about it!</p>
<p>(1) No Creative Mind: Chinese people indeed have no creative mind. For example, people in business, seeing that someone else's business is good, immediately start doing the same business. If someone's writing is good, they immediately imitate or plagiarize.</p>
<p>(2) Harboring a Fluke Mentality: We can definitely say that we have this weakness. For example, now you can get a bonus for smoking cigarettes, you can get a bonus for using soap... Not only do foreigners use this weakness of ours! Even the Chinese themselves are using themselves, to the point that everyone has developed a mentality of getting something for nothing, which is truly lamentable!</p>
<p>(3) No Patriotism: This cannot be generalized. In such a large China, among the 450 million people, there must be many people who have patriotism, right? However, seeing that the import of enemy goods does not decrease, it can be known that there must be many people who have no patriotism, so although this year is National Goods Year, national goods still cannot sell well.</p>
<p>(4) Harboring a Destructive Mind: When someone is doing something, they are secretly sabotaging it, or someone has painted a snow-white wall, but children go and draw marks on it, or someone has posted a wall advertisement, but vandals tear it down. This is harboring a destructive mind, which is also lacking a sense of morality.</p>
<p>Therefore, I hope that readers, after seeing my writing, realize that we Chinese do have this phenomenon, then persuading others everywhere would also be a good thing.</p>
<h3>Northeast Fourth Company Commander</h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Eighteen - Tea with Tender Feelings to Comfort the Couple - Hasty Departure with Forced Smiles to Bid Farewell to Family</p>
<p>He was afraid there wouldn't be enough time, so he immediately blew his whistle and gathered all the soldiers of the company in the courtyard. After calling the roll, seeing a company of brothers standing in front of him, he thought to himself, these people are all going to the outside of the Great Wall to fight for their lives, and in this division of people, this doesn't count as a big deal, but as far as each individual is concerned, it is the biggest thing they will ever do in their lives. How can we let them go on the road confused without saying a word? But thinking about the days when he was a soldier, when he was about to leave, which battalion commander had ever mentioned anything? If he were to say something, wouldn't that be meddling? So he simply didn't say a word. After standing in formation, he led the brothers to the battalion headquarters for assembly, and then from the battalion headquarters to the parade ground. The sun in the eastern sky, like a golden basin, cast golden sunlight onto the parade ground, shining on Zhao Ziqiang's regiment standing with their backs to the sun. Their regimental commander, from afar, said a few words of instruction without reason, and then asked loudly, "Brothers, have you eaten your fill?" Everyone drew a breath from their dan tian and replied, "We've eaten our fill!" He asked again, "Have you had your fill of drinks?" They all replied in unison, "We've had our fill!" Then Battalion Commander Bao Fang personally came out and shouted the command, "Right turn, forward march!" They were the first battalion, so naturally they were walking at the front of the regiment. Zhao Ziqiang followed the team, walking step by step along the Shanghai Dian Avenue. If he hadn't been following the team, he wouldn't have known where he was going or where he was walking. The marching troops were not walking too busily. The brothers were walking at a comfortable pace, one foot high and the other low. Some were talking quietly in twos and threes, and some were singing very softly. Zhao Ziqiang thought to himself, the brothers are all setting out calmly, so why am I so distraught? So he straightened his chest and looked straight ahead, walking step by step. (242)</p>
<p>World News</p>
<h3>Italians Promote Fashion Trends</h3>
<p>Italy has also heard of panic in recent years, but Italian industrialists, following Mussolini's guidance, not only love to use domestic goods and revive foreign trade, but they also go to Paris as the center of the world's Hua industry and the source of world fashion. Therefore, clothing stores in Italian metropolises such as Milan and Florence have vigorously launched new styles, even suppressing Parisian speculators. Therefore, the world's great tycoons have all rushed to Italy upon hearing the news.</p>
<h3>French Lifespan</h3>
<p>In recent years, the lifespan of French people has gradually increased. Since the French Revolution, the average lifespan has been only 28 years and 9 months. By 1800, it had increased to 40 years, in 1900 to 45 years and 9 months, and in 1910 to 48 years. Although there were no accurate statistics during the war, the average age between 1920 and 1932, for Paris alone, was 52 years and 3 months for men and 56 years for women. In 1911, there were only 13,901 elderly people over the age of 80 living in Paris, with women twice as many. By 1926, there were 16,671 men over the age of 80, and the number of women had doubled. According to last year's statistics, the number of deaths was 13.6 per thousand, which is a very significant decrease compared to 1909.</p>
<h3>Minister's Daughter</h3>
<p>Hungarian Finance Minister Baron Golan's daughter, Branci Yuan, is 20 years old this year. Because she is studying home economics, she went to a coffee shop near the old palace of Putabespiside to learn how to make chicken cakes and ice cream. She studies for six hours every day. People think that the daughter of the minister is willing to look for a job, so the daughters of other powerful people also thought of the job front.</p>
<h3>Korean Lifespan</h3>
<p>In places with cold climates, people's lifespans, according to statistics released by the Italian Statistics Bureau, are 55 years and 3 months for Norwegians, 55 years for Swedes, 53 years for Dutch, 50 years and 5 months for British, 47 years for Belgians, 47 years for French, 46 years for Germans, 44 years for Italians, and 41 years for Austrians. According to this, Norway is the coldest country in Europe, and its lifespan is the longest, while Austria is the hottest country, and its lifespan is the shortest. It can be seen that from cold to warm, the lifespan gradually decreases.</p>
<h3>Encouraging Soldiers to Drink</h3>
<p>The Hungarian army is the most fond of drinking in the world. They have to drink some Tuja wine almost every day, but Tuja wine is very expensive, and they cannot buy as much as they want after all. General Gongbo, the Chief of the Army, heard that the soldiers did not have money to drink Tuja wine, so he proposed a capital of 240,000 yuan to subsidize Tuja wine manufacturers, ordering them to improve the quality of the wine and reduce the price of the wine. In particular, the price must be especially cheap for the soldiers, so the Hungarian soldiers are very grateful for the good intentions of the Chief of the Army, so that they can drink freely.</p>
<h3>Lions Also Lose Jobs</h3>
<p>The Paris City Authority is now unable to cope with the unemployment problem of a hundred lions.</p>
<p>These lions initially participated in the German circus and patrolled in various European countries. Later, the circus disbanded, and the lions were sent back to Paris. The city authority wanted to temporarily deposit the lions in the zoo, but the zoo did not have a budget for raising lions, and there was no place to place the lions, so it refused to deposit them. Now, a hundred lions are in a situation where they cannot be disposed of, so they have to post an advertisement for cheap sale. It is said that until now, there are really not many employers.</p>

<h3>International News Worsens, Bullion Price Sets New Low: $687.30</h3>
<p>▲Short Position Spreads Post $5.80 to $6.50▲</p>
<p>The gold market continued to decline for several consecutive days, and yesterday was no exception. Despite significant efforts by major players to cover short positions, leading to a temporary rebound, the overall environment for the gold market remained extremely unfavorable. As the day drew to a close, rumors of adverse developments continued to circulate, making it difficult to maintain support and indicating a downward trend. The morning began with declines in silver markets in England and the United States, as well as a drop in forward silver prices on the Five Metals Exchange. Exchange rates continued to rise sharply. Spot gold in London rose by 5.5 pence. The US official gold purchase price remained unchanged. Stocks fell by $1.14. US cotton rose slightly, and US wheat fell by 2 points. The raw wool market opened and immediately broke the $700 mark, retreating to $695 or $696. The situation continued to deteriorate, approaching $690. After the opening, banks consolidated their positions, and major players aggressively covered their short positions. News that HSBC's exchange rates for British and American currencies had both decreased by 25 points boosted morale, as traders had anticipated a rebound. Reuters reported that US Treasury Secretary Woodin and Undersecretary Acheson had resigned due to their opposition to Roosevelt's monetary policy. Both men were proponents of sound money. News of exchange rate stabilization also circulated. Major players, including Heng Yu, Qian Changxiang, Da Decheng, Hong Li, Sen Changyong, and Fu Yu, entered the market, causing a significant rebound, pushing the price up to $704. The market leveled off slightly at noon. Later, Reuters reported that the new US Treasury Secretary, Morgenthau, firmly expressed support for President Roosevelt's policy of purchasing gold both domestically and internationally to raise prices. He also advocated halving the gold content of the US dollar and opposed stabilizing exchange rates in the near future. This news significantly dampened market sentiment. The market opened and immediately broke the $700 mark. Subsequently, the overall trend became unsustainable, gradually breaking the $690 mark and creating a new low of $687.30. The premium for refined gold was $1107. Short position spreads were posted from $5.80 to $6.50. The following is a record of the day's market activity:</p>

The Dalian gang and Yida Yong sold at $4.60. However, market sentiment rebounded, and major players aggressively covered their short positions. News that HSBC's exchange rates for British and American currencies had both decreased by 25 points boosted morale. Mitsui, taking March US dollar positions, had already risen to 8125, and rose to $703.50. Yuan Maoyong, Bing Xing, and Zhao Fengchang also sold, while Citibank set the price for January US dollars at 25, lowering it to 05. Zhi Fengyong, Yuan Maoyong, Yida, Shui Rui Kang, and Yuan Fengyong re-entered, pushing the price up to $3.

McGalliard and the Japanese bank aggressively sold January US dollars at 25, further lowering the price to 02. Yida Yong maintained stability through purchases from Meng. After fluctuating, the noon closing was $700.80, with physical goods selling at 02. Finally, Yuan Maoyong and others sold, subsequently retreating to within $699.</p>
<p>The afternoon opened at $697, with physical goods opening at $6.80. Heng Yu sold orders, and although banks took March US dollar positions at 875, they soon found it difficult to sell, retreating from $7.80 to $4.30. Yuan Mao and Shui bought orders, returning to $6. Pan Gen set the price for February at 6875. Heng Yu, Bing Xing, Da Decheng, Zhi Fengyong, Heng Xing, and Tian Feng jointly sold orders, lowering the price to $689.60.

Wahbi took March US dollar positions at 25, gradually rising to $9.80. Market sentiment was extremely weak. Physical goods closed at $68.30 due to supply from Bing Xing and others. After the market closed, physical goods were sold, and Da Fayong also bought, once retreating to $6. Heng Xing and others continued to buy, finally returning to over $7.50. It was found that the highest price of the day was $704 and the lowest price was $687.30, a difference of $16.70. As a result, the closing price fell by $16.40 compared to the previous closing price. Taking into account the $6 difference in swap spreads, it only fell by $10.40.</p>
<p>The listed price was due to HSBC Bank's US dollar listing, round 25, at $33.75, resulting in a bullion price of $711. Based on the closing price, the approximate premium was $3 or more, an increase of $1 or so compared to the previous closing price. The account price for this month was $715, December was $707, and January was $701. The supplemental water price in the morning was $715, and the account price in the afternoon was $701, December was $693, and January was $687. The price for refined gold was $1107. In floor trading, the former market was sold by the Tianjin gang to Ying Fengheng for $1109, and the latter market for $06, totaling approximately 3,000 taels. In this period's swap spreads, the Dalian gang Shunli initially posted a spread of $0.30 to $6.50, which was the same as the spreads posted by Tong Tai Changdao Chengsuo. Later, Hong Xing, Fu Yu, and Qian Changxiang posted spreads of $6.34, while Da Changxiang, Heng Xing, and Chang Sheng Yong posted spreads. At this time, more transactions were made. After entering the market, it became colder. Rui Xing posted 14 orders to Heng Yu at $5.80, and Yi Yu settled 407 orders with Hong Xing at $6.40.

<h3>Securities: Fujian Situation Brews, Whole Six Bonds Fall Up to $1.90, Remainder Fall Around $1</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange's market atmosphere was completely shrouded by news of the political change in Fujian Province. The more chaotic the news, the more suspicious people became. Rumors abounded, and market sentiment became even softer. Many small retail investors came out, and No. 4 also stopped absorbing, and the market price showed a slump. In reality, the Fujian matter is still brewing, and it is said that the internal situation is not consistent, and the central government is adhering to the principle of peace and engaging in mediation. The actual situation is not as serious as reported outside, and it may not be difficult to resolve. Market prices have been small for many days, and since the departure of Finance Minister Song, there has been no rebound. The market has shrunk by as much as $6 or $7 compared to before. If the Fujian matter has a slight turnaround, the rebound will also be very dramatic. Yesterday's opening market was slightly dazed, and the market price was slightly different due to different choices between long and short positions, only two or three jiao. The consolidated salt tax was relatively stable, and the near term was slightly better by five fen. In the secondary market, major players were still selling, coupled with the changing of long positions, market sentiment turned weak, and most fell by three, five, or six jiao, while the whole six long-term orders fell by as much as eight jiao. The current monthly salt tax only fell by one jiao, and the market price was slightly chaotic. In the afternoon, No. 58 sold out, and although Nos. 20 and 33 bought in, the long-term positions were changed more fiercely, so the opening price fell unanimously again, but the amount of the fall varied greatly. For example, the gold short suddenly fell by more than $1, while the consolidated customs tax only fell by three or four jiao. The market has been in a period of competition between long and short forces. The closing price did not improve due to the late news that Hu You had already entered Fujian. The whole six fell by another seven jiao, and the rest also fell by three or five jiao. Although the future is not yet optimistic, it may still rise slightly. As a result, market prices fell again, mostly around one yuan, but the whole six fell by $1.60 to $1.90. The total turnover was estimated to be over $20 million.</p>
<h3>New York Stock Market in Speculative Observation</h3>
<p>Xinfeng Foreign Firm reported that the New York stock market on the 15th still lacked excitement. Although the business report was good and the US dollar hit a new low, speculators were watching due to unclear currency issues. As a result, the market was slightly tired. Regarding the changes in the US Treasury Department, some parties believe that this is a precursor to breaking away from a comprehensive monetary policy, so the US dollar should be adversely affected, and indirectly will raise prices. World gold soared to $24.45, while the Financial Rehabilitation Agency's gold price remained at $33.56. Some speculate that this is the government's cautious action to avoid public debt falling and disrupting the government's credit. Total daily volume was 133 shares, and it was also claimed that the Iron Century report showed that the steel workload at the beginning of the week was 27.1%, and now it has dropped to 26%. Demand from public construction and the automotive industry is lower, but each automotive company will not repurchase before January and February next year, and the purchase of goods on the railway will also be delayed until January 1 next year. "Wheat" buyers are hesitant, down two points from yesterday, and can be bought when it falls. "Cotton" The recent advance of cotton has been entirely due to the weakness of the US dollar, and the impact of the fall of US dollars in various countries is in doubt whether it will no longer take retaliatory measures. Therefore, although there are some parties that interpret the Secretary of the Treasury's retirement as currency inflation, long positions should still be cautious. The Financial Rehabilitation Agency buys gold at a price of $33.56 per tael. The Dow Jones index is listed below.</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cloth: Tagged Yarn and Cloth Generally Stable</h3>
<p>The yarn market initially fell and then rebounded, but the situation is still tired and lifeless. The actual market demand has also stalled, and the statistics of various gangs buying throughout the day is only 304 packages, which shows the lack of funds and the stagnation of sales in various parties. Moreover, the world's industry situation is showing signs of instability.</p>
<h3>Human Tagging: Lifeless</h3>
<p>The market sentiment at the opening of the pre-market human tagging was that the rumors of the current situation were very high, and the gold market fell terribly, breaking through the $700 mark. The long positions slightly settled, and each month fell by $1.34. It was heard in the afternoon that current sales were quite clear, but some positions were offset, and each month rose by $3, $4, and $5. The total turnover for the day was 6,300 packages. It was found that Hengyi sold 400 packages, Yuanda 900 packages, Changfeng 450 packages, and Deji 900 packages. Xinchang bought 400 packages, Chunji 350 packages, Changyu 300 packages, Renfeng 950 packages, and Xie Sheng 300 packages. The closing price is as follows:</p>
<p>Human Tagging Closing Increase/Decrease Account Balance Human Tagging Closing Increase/Decrease Account Balance</p>

<p>January 1851 Decrease 1 61,450 April 1860 Increase 2 8,000</p>
<p>Total 237,550</p>
<h3>Yarn Sales: Class Zero</h3>
<p>The current yarn sales are quite clear. It was found that the statistics of various gangs buying throughout the day were 304 packages. Sales were flat and tired, and the double-line price was softer than yesterday. The purchase amount of each gang is as follows:</p>
<p>Tianjin 35 Inland 123 Guangdong 30 Zhenjiang 10</p>
<p>Shantou 50 Jiangxi 10 Ningbo 36 Nanjing 10</p>
<p>The cotton market is still unchanged, and the market situation is still flat, but the Indian and American cotton markets are trending weaker, and the gold market is falling more and more fiercely, so market sentiment is weak, and Japanese merchants' minds are softening. The current cotton selling price is getting cheaper every day, and has fallen by another five jiao compared to yesterday. The price of Indian cotton is gradually approaching, so in terms of the general trend, the future is not optimistic. The US cotton picking price has broken through the $40 mark.</p>
<h3>Zheng Tagging Still Stable</h3>
<p>The market sentiment at the opening of the pre-market Zheng tagging was softer, and each month fell by five fen to one jiao. In the afternoon, the market rebounded by five fen to one jiao due to the lack of sellers and short covering in the market. The total turnover for the day was 23,600 dan. It was found that Jifeng sold 1,600 dan, Changfeng 2,700 dan, Yukang 1,200 dan, Changji 1,000 dan, Taixing 900 dan, and Delong 900 dan. Hengyi bought 2,300 dan, Yuanda 1,100 dan, Yongchang 900 dan, Tongfu 800 dan, Xinhua 1,600 dan, and Xinheng 1,600 dan. The closing price is as follows:</p>

<p>January 4270 Increase 5 184,400 April 4115 ... 44,200</p>
<p>Total 794,600</p>
<h3>Indian Cotton Re-Opens</h3>
<p>The current cotton business has slightly improved, and Indian cotton has re-opened. The sources are estimated at 520 packages of Yao cotton and 1,985 packages of Tong cotton. The current cotton prices are as follows:</p>
<p>Shaanxi Cotton, 39.50 Dong Cotton Firm Enters 200 Pieces To Shanghai</p>
<p>Fire Engine Cotton 37.00 Dong Cotton Firm Enters 200 Packages Also Da Kang</p>

<p>Lumei Seed 34.25 Dong Cotton Firm Enters 165 Pieces Also Stack Delivery</p>
<h3>World Cotton Market Falls More Than Rises</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the US cotton market started to thrive due to speculators buying in, then fell back due to the weakness of Wall Street, and finally rebounded due to industry buying in. Spot goods remained unchanged, and futures rose by one point to three points per pound. Liverpool cotton spot fell by three points, futures fell by ten points to the next point. Egyptian cotton spot fell by three points. The Bombay cotton market fell due to the fall in the price of gold coins and the sale by European exporters. As a result, all fell by one rupee. The original telegram recorded the left (15th telegram)</p>

<h3>Grain: Factory Inventory Low, Tag Flour Rebounds</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning, each month presented a stable and strong appearance. Although foreign wheat quotations in Chicago were about six jiao lower, and Canadian small ones were about one point lower, the market sentiment remained stable after the opening. Although there was dumping of foreign wheat, it could not become a reality at present. Moreover, since the inventory of each factory was searched by the northern gangs, it was no longer substantial. Therefore, the sentiment of outsiders was extremely firm, and people inside and outside the industry paid great attention to it. And because of the short covering of inland manufacturers, the market atmosphere gradually stabilized. When the afternoon market opened, because the morning did not fall but rose, the market sentiment became more firm, and the near term was getting better and better due to the Tianjin gangs' purchase. The long term also presented a strong image because there were not many sales. Looking at the future situation, such as the lack of inventory, it is feared that there will be a good side. As a result, this month rebounded by three fen and seven li and a half, December rose by two fen and two li and a half, January rose by fen, February rose by one fen and a half, March rose by one fen and two li and a half, and April rose by one fen and a half.</p>
<h3>Futures and Spot Wheat Both Show Quiet and Firm Signs</h3>
<p>Yesterday's wheat market showed signs of being near hidden and far flat in each month after the opening of the morning and afternoon markets. The quotations for foreign wheat were about six jiao lower in Chicago and about one jiao lower in Canada. However, market sentiment was that although there were continued successes in foreign wheat, the domestic arrivals in the near term were not visible, and the market situation thereafter must be stabilized. Therefore, although transactions were not smooth, market sentiment was very firm. There were not many buyers in the long term, and the people were always worried because of the lengthening of the US exchange rate, so the market atmosphere was also very silent. The spot wheat market is still stable, with the opening price of Yaowan wheat at $4.07, Gaoyou wheat at $3.95, and Jiangyan wheat at $4.04, totaling 2,400 packages, which were handled by Fuxin.</p>
<h3>White Japonica Rice Falls About a Jiao</h3>
<p>(Shanghai South) The source is more than 40 warehouses, about 5,000 shi of goods, the shop stomach on this street is slightly inferior to before, only about 2,000 shi, the situation has turned lax, the market situation is flat and tired, although the sellers are extremely high, they will take the people's ordinary heart, and it will not help the overall situation. The prices of Changbang Su Tong Nan Gang japonica rice are soft, about a jiao, and Du Jian is also tired for several points. Only Yang Jian can stand still because of the lack of goods. As for the package stomach, there are continued two or three thousand packages, but because the accumulated source is still a lot, although the route is strong, there is still a feeling of oversupply, so the market situation is inevitably affected by the decline. Fortunately, the sellers are tightened, and only slightly repair a few points. The Yin Yuan wine households are quite active, and the market color is continued to be strong, and the Bian Yuan has no significant fluctuations.</p>
<p>(Shanghai North) 51 or 2 warehouses arrive from all roads, and the sales in the market continue to be light. The market shape has been in a hovering situation in recent days. The market prices of each cargo are similar, but the new Bian Yuan arrival has a elimination of stagnation, and the price is a small jiao.</p>
<h3>Ningbo Gang Handles Loading Coarse Xiang Rice - Passenger Coins Take Small Steps of More Than Half a Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday's market for Ke Xian rice was even more sluggish. The Fujian gang's handling of the stomach was even more stagnant. The merchants in this street also watched more, and the arrivals never stopped. The inventory gradually recovered, but the cargo owners directly handled the loading in the producing area with the help of Ke Gang, the cost was high, and they were not too willing to sell at a low price, so the market situation was still able to stand flat, and had not gone downstream with the sales. Yesterday, Ke Xian only handled 100 packages of Jiangxi machine late rice from Quanzhou, priced at 78 jiao, and there were no other transactions. Later, the Ningbo gang took advantage of the small size to handle 500 packages of Shashi coarse rice, priced at $5.35 to $5.30. If this rice can be sold smoothly when it is loaded, there is still hope for continued handling. In this street, 120 packages of Jiangxi machine Yuan rice were traded, priced at $7.75. Although the goods were inferior, the price had fallen by more than half a yuan since the end of last month. The Northern Gang also tried to handle 68 packages of Wuhu machine Yuan, priced at $8.50.</p>
<h3>Jiujiang Black Sesame Declining Trend is Set</h3>
<p>Since the new Jiujiang black sesame crop came on the market, the market has consistently declined. This is largely because this year's harvest is abundant, while sales have decreased. The initial selling price opened at ten yuan, but the second batch immediately fell to nine yuan and fifty cents. It then steadily dropped to eight yuan and thirty cents. Midway, there was a slight rebound of thirty cents, opening at eight yuan and sixty cents. Afterwards, it gradually declined. As of yesterday's market, the declining trend has somewhat stabilized, as the supply has also decreased. The remaining stock is about a thousand packages. Yesterday, the Ningbo guild and local dealers moved over six hundred and sixty packages, with prices ranging from seven yuan and forty cents to seven yuan and thirty and a half cents. With strong sales and low inventory, people's confidence has returned.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Refined White Sugar Call for Price Increase Unsuccessful</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market saw a slight increase in customs gold, but sales remained sluggish, and the trend remained flat and weak. The guild's quoted prices for second-grade coarse granulated white sugar were twenty yuan and thirty cents for ordinary goods, nineteen yuan and eighty cents for 20-grade medium granulated white sugar, sixteen yuan for 89-grade red high grade, and fifteen yuan and seventy cents for ordinary grade. There were few transactions. The quoted price for China No. 1 refined white sugar increased by five cents, to nineteen yuan and five cents, but no deals were made. There were sporadic price quotes for Chaozhou green sugar, ranging from fifteen yuan and forty cents, fourteen yuan and seventy cents to fourteen yuan and twenty cents. The Jianbang guild offered several dozen cases of high-grade hand-made crystal sugar, with each base priced at seventeen yuan and forty cents. Taikoo Sugar B mark was at twenty yuan and sixty cents.</p>
<h3>Oil Market: Turpentine and Vegetable Oil from Zhejiang Report Price Increases</h3>
<p>Turpentine from western Zhejiang is currently entering the market with new goods. Unexpectedly, the price of turpentine seeds has suddenly surged. Last week, the buying price for seeds was still only five yuan and fifty or sixty cents per dan, but recently, as various pressing workshops have started operating, the purchase price has increased to over six yuan, leading to higher costs. A few days ago, merchants from the interior came to Shanghai to sell over two hundred pieces of turpentine oil per railway car, offering a delivered price of twenty yuan and two cents per deduction. However, due to the sudden increase in seed prices, no one is willing to sell at this price anymore. Judging by the current market, the price is likely to be above twenty-one yuan. However, the Wuhan market has not yet changed. The Jinlan area of eastern Zhejiang has also seen price increases. Therefore, the market conditions in the north and south are gradually diverging. Local merchants, because of the new harvest season, have low inventory costs and initially thought that southern oil prices were reasonable. Now that price increases are being reported everywhere, they may shift their attention to Wuhan oil again.</p>
<h3>Hardware: Native Nails Find Smoother Sales</h3>
<p>Native factory nails (commonly referred to as native nails in the market) have recently seen more prosperous business. Customers from areas like Changjiang Road, as well as ports such as Ningbo, Fuzhou, and Wenzhou, are purchasing them. Furthermore, local construction teams, painters, and glass shops are all making transactions. Therefore, over the past two days, it is estimated that three to four thousand barrels have been sold. The price per barrel (one hundred pounds on a Tianping scale) is seven yuan and twenty cents for double-stranded nails, which is four or five cents cheaper than imported products. It is said that the supply of raw materials has been very low in recent days. People's confidence is strong, and the market is expected to increase significantly.</p>
<h3>Raw Silk: Chinese Silk Exports Reach Their Limit</h3>
<p>▲Shanghai Factory Exports Plummet ▲European and American Silk Sales Plummet, Yellow and White Factory Exports Reach Their Limit. At least six to seven hundred bales are exported every week. Recently, due to abundant silk stocks overseas, hoarders are unable to find buyers for their goods. The export of Chinese silk from the Shanghai Customs has sharply decreased. Last week, the total number of yellow and white factory silk shipped to Europe and the United States was only one hundred and seventy-eight bales, setting a new record low since the export of factory silk began. Hangzhou also only shipped fifteen bales.</p>
<p>▲Hangzhou and Shaoxing Doubled Cocoons Shipped to Shanghai Not Weak ▲Doubled cocoons silk sales to Europe show some improvement. ▲Luntai Doubled Cocoons Silk Mill has resumed work, the need for doubled cocoons gradually increases. Yesterday morning, Hangzhou shipped three hundred and eighty dan, or four hundred and seventy-four bales, of Hangzhou and Shaoxing doubled cocoons.</p>
<p>▲Lower-Grade White Filature Silk for Printing Sells Poorly. The New York raw silk market is sluggish as factory advances remain weak and no one is asking about current silk prices, and price continues to stagnate. French and British raw silk is being sold off as before, and Chinese raw silk has prices but no sales, and silk telegrams are unmoving. European and American firms in Shanghai are all taking a wait-and-see approach. Lower-grade white filature silk for printing is also scarce. Yesterday, only Xiangji and others imported fifteen bales, and the price remained flat and weak.</p>
<h3>Needle, Eyebrow, Pearl Tea Sales to France Continue to be Smooth</h3>
<p>Yesterday in Shanghai's foreign firms' tea market and local firms, needle and eyebrow tea, and Wuyuan pearl tea, run by companies like Tongfu and Yongxing, continued to be actively procured due to strong overseas demand. The total volume of deals reached over four hundred boxes, with sales unchanged from before. However, the market for Zhenmei tea softened yesterday. The sales of Gongxi green tea to Russian firms have completely stopped, and local brokers are not asking about it.</p>

<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>Youth and Lao Tzu</h3>
<p>— Yi Zun</p>
<p>I heard that "ever since European culture spread eastward," Chinese morality has deteriorated, especially among modern youth, who often look down on Lao Tzu. This is likely a big mistake, because after seeing several examples, I feel that Lao Tzu is indeed very useful and beneficial to young people, not just as an aid to "literary cultivation."</p>
<p>There is an old article—I forget which book it's from—that tells us about a Taoist priest who possessed the art of immortality. He claimed to be over a hundred years old but looked "as beautiful as jade," like someone in their twenties. One day, this living immortal was hosting a grand banquet when suddenly an old man with white hair and beard came up to him asking for money. The Taoist priest scolded him away. While everyone was surprised, the living immortal said with emotion, "That's my young son. He didn't listen to me and refused to cultivate the Tao. Now you see, he's not even sixty yet and he's aged so terribly." Everyone was naturally very moved, but later they finally learned that the man was actually the Taoist priest's father.</p>
<p>There is also a new article that tells us about an ambitious person whose theories were very correct. He not only talked the talk but also walked the walk. However, when he saw old men suffering in some places, he thought of his own father. Even if his ideals were realized, it wouldn't make his father a master who didn't have to suffer. Therefore, he came up with even more correct theories, abandoned his original ideals, and became a filial son. If his parents had died early, how could his theories be so complete and grandiose? Isn't this also the benefit of Lao Tzu to young people?</p>
<p>So, is there no solution for young people whose fathers have already died? I think there is. There are still ways to figure it out. We still need to check old books. Another article—I also forgot which book it's from—tells us about an old woman who was begging for food when suddenly a wealthy man came up to her and said she was his long-lost mother. She took the opportunity and became an old lady. Later, when her son was marrying off his daughter, he and the old lady went to a jewelry store to buy gold jewelry. He took the items that the old lady had already liked to show his wife-to-be. Meanwhile, he asked the old lady to keep looking—but he disappeared from then on.</p>
<p>However, this is still like learning from the Taoist priest. You need to do it with real things. If you just make self-confessions, it doesn't matter if you really have a father or not. Someone previously advocated "virtual constitutional monarchy," so why not have "unparented filial sons" now? Zhang Zongchang respected Confucius, but his mansion probably didn't have the "Four Books" and "Five Classics."</p>
<h3>Random Thoughts on Viewing Chrysanthemums</h3>
<p>— Mu Mutian</p>
<p>Alone in a foreign land, I am a stranger,</p>
<p>Every holiday makes me miss my family even more.</p>
<p>I know my brothers are climbing to high places,</p>
<p>Wearing dogwood everywhere, missing one person.</p>
<p>This is a seven-character quatrain by the Tang Dynasty poet Wang Wei. Who doesn't know these four lines? Who isn't familiar with them? Writing them out, I think some enlightened people will say I'm "dumping garbage." However, today, facing these four lines, I feel a great longing.</p>
<p>I haven't been a good son. I haven't been a good brother either. Although my heart is good, they don't really understand. Not only am I always indifferent to my own family, but I also don't care much about my hometown. I feel that the best life is wandering. Living a wandering life in a foreign land is better than being bored "getting upset" in my hometown. Begging for food in a foreign land is better than being a landlord in my hometown. Although the country is now destroyed and the family broken, I still find the life of a small bourgeois in the city interesting.</p>
<p>Since returning to China, I have been gradually moving away from the café life. The sentimental and melancholic emotions of the past have also been uprooted in my heart. Maybe I'm just getting older. "Oil, salt, firewood, and rice" have gradually brought me closer to reality, making me realize that sorrow and depression are useless. Why drink coffee? Why drink wine? Although I shouldn't have gone down the path of writing, "since I'm here, I'll be content." Although I'm just a "half-empty bottle," I can still be somewhat useful. "Be a monk for a day, strike the bell for a day." Without a "monk," a "bald head" can also save a lost soul.</p>
<p>Recently, my mentality has been to live honestly, but today, my "heart has changed drastically." Going to school, seeing chrysanthemums everywhere, I feel an indescribable sadness. It's as if those chrysanthemums are all painted with blood. A few days ago, seeing news about "Chrysanthemum Festivals" everywhere, I didn't feel anything, but today, I feel an indescribable sadness. I miss the Northeast under the iron heel of imperialism. I can't help but recall Wang Wei's lines.</p>
<p>What's happening in the Northeast now? How are the people of the Northeast living in that fiery hell? I'm not exactly missing family, but I'm thinking of those hardworking farmers who have nowhere to turn. And in the Central Plains, are there still people appreciating chrysanthemums as if nothing has happened? I can't help but think of the phrase "only tranquility can lead to far-reaching things." At the same time, I think of the "Empty City Stratagem" even more. Perhaps the "Empty City Stratagem" is the Chinese people's specialty. However, now the imperialists probably don't have a marshal like Sima Yi who leads by example (tell you all, I saw this on the stage), so the "Empty City Stratagem" probably won't scare him. Try firing two cannons. What do we do then?</p>
<p>"The Dream of the Red Chamber" governs the country, "Golden Lotus" sells the home." It is said that this is the secret of the Manchu emperors. "Water Margin" and "Romance of the Three Kingdoms" are excellent military books. In particular, the "Empty City Stratagem" has been used countless times by a certain young marshal. The certain young marshal is not only good at singing the "Empty City Stratagem," but he has also reversed his father's militaristic ways and accepted Tolstoy's non-resistance doctrine. Moreover, he is thoroughly implementing it. I remember that a Japanese newspaper nominated him for the Nobel Peace Prize several years ago. I don't know if his name is on the list for this year's Nobel Peace Prize. However, today, I thought of the "Empty City Stratagem" from the chrysanthemums, and from the "Empty City Stratagem" I thought of a certain young teacher.</p>
<p>"Drawing a sword to cut water, the water flows more; raising a cup to dispel sorrow, sorrow increases more." The more I look at the chrysanthemums, the more unbearable my heart becomes. That's why I thought of Wang Wei's four lines. Today, I feel that these four lines have profound meaning. This is something I haven't experienced before.</p>
<p>Writing this, I recall seeing a Chrysanthemum Festival in Dalian City several years ago. Now, there is probably an even grander Chrysanthemum Festival in Dalian. Then, I remembered seeing a plan of "Manchukuo" and "Xinjing" in an illustrated magazine a few days ago, and I felt very sad, as if it were full of the blood of the "Manchu" people. However, today's mood is similar to that day.</p>
<p>But now, the armed people of "Manchuria" are still actively resisting Japan, right? Perhaps only they can save themselves.</p>
<h3>Ganpu Correspondence (End)</h3>
<p>— A Ying</p>
<p>Dear Brother □□</p>
<p>Anyone who has been to Ganpu probably knows about "Nanbei Lake." "Nanbei Lake" was originally named "Yongan Lake," about five miles from the west city. The form of this lake is the same as "West Lake," divided into north and south, separated by a long embankment, with pavilions and bridges, and tall "sidewalk willows" on both sides. Surrounded by mountains, except for the south, where the sea is. According to Mr. Wu Xiahu's "Ganpu" book, the lake's boundary has twelve li, a total of more than 3,700 acres, irrigating more than 8,000 acres of fields. Because it resembles "West Lake," it is commonly called "Little West Lake." However, compared to the two lakes, "Little West Lake" is not as beautiful as "West Lake," and it is really unavoidable to be "small," so that people's chests cannot be as open as they get on "West Lake." But there are also different places here from "West Lake," that is, there are endless tall trees on the mountains on three sides, and relying on the lake, there is a vast salt field, boundless sea: these cannot be found on "West Lake." If you want to take in these scenery at a glance, it is not difficult, just climb to the Jiujiu Peak, you can see the full view of West Lake: special is the crescent-shaped connected salt fields, thousands and tens of thousands of workers, if you are willing to approach it, you will gain a lot of experience, a good education. The problem is, what I know, is that most of the people who come here are visiting the lake, and few come to inspect the life of the salt area, as for understanding the suffering of the salt people, there is no need to talk about it.</p>
<p>I lived in the mountains north of this lake for nearly a month. I usually took a boat across the two lakes to the salt area in the early morning, and then rowed back in the evening. Of course, there are many things to record about the life on the lake, such as the lake and mountains in the moonlight, the fun of picking clams, the return journey in a storm, and some meditations caused by the changing lake scenery. But the joy is not my main purpose in coming here, and I don't want to touch on them one by one. However, there are some things that I can't forget. One is that the children on the lake, because of our short-term close life, are very shaken and very admired of the city. No matter where you are, you can see it. The city influences the countryside, this is inevitable, and the girls are really special and severe. I feel that this phenomenon makes the ancient and quiet air of a small "West Lake" very unstable. Here, I am delighted, I see how their psychology is gradually evolving, and how their expressions are gradually becoming tense. This picture, which is rarely clear and inevitable, allows me to see very deeply that I should state that the main reason is due to the influence of several women who came with me. Secondly, it was on the eve of my third departure from this place. That night, in order to commemorate the completion of most of our work, most people would not come again, and it was a clear night with a gentle breeze, and the lake and mountains were special. We hired four small boats and paralleled each other in the two lakes, rippling on the slight waves, and took a refreshing lake tour. I don't know why, in the laughter, autumn singing, and mournful sound of the xiao, I was reminded of an old poem. The full text of the poem is: "Drinking on the bridge on the bridge at midnight, all the people in the seat are heroes, and the stream flows silently in the moon. In the sparse shadows of apricot flowers, blowing the flute until dawn, the last twenty years have been the same. This body is still in surprise. I am free to climb up the small pavilion to see the new sunshine. How many things in ancient and modern times, the fishing songs rise in the middle of the night." I was humming this poem in a low voice, but I couldn't help but feel sad, and felt that the result of today's victory tour was just to increase the pain in the future. I even fell into a state of silence. However, further development of the thought, thinking of the poems written by Lu Fangweng, Wu Rulun and other ancient and modern poets, and even thinking about why they could not see from the development of society to recognize the joy of growth, only pay attention to the gathering and dispersal of individuals, for their own grief, and even could not help but be a little dumb. That night, I traveled in the lake for two hours, making all the salt people of "Xihaitou" wake up from their dreams in surprise, and ran to the shore of the lake to watch. In their eyes, we are not only living in a fairyland, but they know that although we have this moment of happiness, the suffering of struggling for survival is not the same as theirs?</p>
<p>Brother ○○, I can only tell you about the life of Ganpu in the correspondence here. There are many valuable materials and valuable life experiences, so I have to wait for the opportunity to write them out in the future.</p>
<h3>Two Brothers (31)</h3>
<p>— Written by Maupassant, Translated by Li Weike</p>
<p>He lowered his head and ate again.</p>
<p>He wasn't hungry, he felt that nothing tasted good. He was eager to leave, to escape their conversation and jokes.</p>
<p>But Old Man Roland was now swayed by the aroma of the wine, and had forgotten his son's advice. He glanced at the bottle of champagne placed next to his plate, which was almost full. He didn't dare touch it, fearing new rebukes, so he thought of a cunning and clever way to get the wine bottle without attracting Biel's attention. He thought of a trick, a most common trick: he nonchalantly picked up the wine bottle, holding the bottom, stretched out his arm across the table to fill the empty glass in front of Biel; then he took turns filling the glasses of the others, and when it was his turn, he spoke loudly, although he poured a little into his own glass, others would surely say that it was accidental and due to lack of habit. And no one noticed this.</p>
<p>Biel unconsciously drank a lot. With an impatient temperament and a belly full of complaints, he often unconsciously took the tall glass, touched it to his lips, and through the glass, we could see many small bubbles running in the lively transparent liquid. He then slowly poured the liquid into his mouth, in order to feel the gas scattered on his tongue giving him a sweet little prickle.</p>
<p>Gradually, a gentle heat filled his body. This heat came from his stomach—which seemed like the furnace of this heat—reached his chest, occupied his limbs, and spread throughout his flesh, like a gentle and beneficial wave that brought happiness. He now felt a little more comfortable, not as impatient as before, not as dissatisfied as before; even the determination to talk to his brother about that matter tonight relaxed, not because he intentionally gave up on it, but because he didn't want to disturb the happiness he was feeling so quickly.</p>
<p>Boziru stood up and invited everyone to toast.</p>
<p>After bowing to everyone, he said!</p>
<p>"Ladies and gentlemen; we are gathered here today to celebrate a happy event for one of our friends. People used to say that wealth should be blind, but I thought it was just a little short-sighted or cunning. Now it has indeed made the son of Captain Roland of the Pearl, our loyal partner, prominent in Harbor."</p>
<p>After the speech, there was a burst of cheers and applause; Old Man Roland stood up to answer.</p>
<p>He seemed to have a little suffocation in his throat, and his tongue was not very flexible. After coughing for a while, he stammered:</p>
<p>"Thank you, Captain, I thank you on behalf of myself and my son. I will never forget your kindness. I toast in return."</p>
<p>His eyes and nostrils were filled with tears. He sat down, he had nothing more to say.</p>
<p>Now it was Zheeran's turn to speak, who was grinning;</p>
<p>"I should thank you here, loyal and elegant friends (he looked at Mrs. Lu), thanking you for giving me this moving proof of friendship today. But these are not a few words that can express my gratitude to you. In the future, at any time in my life, I will express my gratitude to you, because our friendship is not the kind of fleeting friendship."</p>
<p>His mother was very moved and said softly:</p>
<p>"Very good, my child."</p>
<p>But Boziru shouted:</p>
<p>"Come on, Mrs. Lu, you speak a few words on behalf of the women."</p>
<p>She raised her glass and said in a kind and slightly sad voice:</p>
<p>"As for me, I raise a glass to bless the spirit of Mr. Malaisha in heaven."</p>

<p>Talking About</p>
<h3>A Study of Running Dogs</h3>
<p>— Fu Ba</p>
<p>Judging by the character for "dog" (狗), its fate is not particularly good. The "Shuowen Jiezi" (說文解字, Explanatory Dictionary of Characters) under "dog" quotes Confucius saying: "Dog, to knock. Knocking at air to guard." From the two words "to knock" (叩也), we can imagine a state of wagging its tail and begging for pity, which does not seem very heroic. Further, from the "Erya" (爾雅, Approaching the Correct) which states, "Dog, not yet fully grown with hair" (犬，未成豪狗), it appears that a dog is simply a smaller version of a dog's cheek. Translated directly, it means "small dog," which in people's minds feels particularly insignificant, and even in a comprehensive zoological dictionary, it may not occupy a very high position.</p>
<p>However, as of today, this insignificant little dog has actually seen a great upswing in its fortunes, as if the Republic of China entered the "Dog Year" (戍運) in its twenty-first year. Thus, those who praise people call them "running dogs" (走狗), gamblers have greyhound racing (跑狗), and the Beijing Public Security Bureau Chief, in accordance with this "Dog Year" luck, issued a decree prohibiting women from keeping dogs. Recently, some busybodies in Shanghai have even formed a "Dog Beating Brigade" (打狗團). Although their intentions may differ—good, bad, supportive, or destructive—their attention on this dog is the same. Alas, the dog's luck can be said to be prosperous!</p>
<p>Ancient classifications of dogs were broadly divided into three types: The "Book of Rites: Subtleties" (禮疏) states, "There are three types of dogs: first, guard dogs, those that guard the home; second, field dogs, those used for hunting; third, food dogs, used to fill the kitchen with delicacies." The first type is the kind mentioned earlier that "knocks at air to guard," like the German Shepherd police dogs kept by modern wealthy people in their gatehouses. The second type is the fat and strong dogs seen on the streets today, with iron wire muzzles, either held by Westerners, wandering on the roadside, or sitting proudly in Ford automobiles. As for the third type, they were once cherished by General "Long Legs," and now, Shanghainese Cantonese restaurants occasionally sell a piece of it, called "Dog Leg" (戍腿). Notably absent from this list is the term "running dog." The term "running dog" first appeared in the "Yanzi Chunqiu" (晏子春秋, The Annals of Master Yan). The "Yanzi Chunqiu," in the chapter "Admonitions," records: "Duke Jing's running dog died, and the Duke ordered it to be provided with an outer coffin and inner offerings. Yanzi heard of this and admonished..." The term "running dog" first appeared in written records. According to records, Duke Jing, as the head of a state, was incomparable to General "Long Legs." The dogs he kept were certainly not food dogs used to fill the kitchen, but undoubtedly a modern Western-style Pekingese. This can be seen from the grandeur of its funeral—coffin and offerings. Alas, this is a dog hero!</p>
<p>Later, Fan Li, a minister of Yue, in his letter to Wen Zhong, wrote, "When the flying birds are exhausted, the good bow is stored away; when the cunning rabbit dies, the running dog is cooked" (飛烏盡，良弓藏，狡兎死，走狗烹), as recorded in Sima Qian's "Records of the Grand Historian" (史記). This marks the beginning of the term "running dog" being recorded in official history. It also appeared once in the unofficial history, "Strategies of the Warring States" (戰國策), both referring to a type of field dog. The reason why field dogs are favored is that they exist between humans and beasts, able to serve their masters. However, the ambiguity of their status also lies here. If you say they are beasts, they help humans slaughter their own kind; if you say they are human, they cannot change their original nature. They seem incompetent, yet they chase rabbits and deer, making a small splash; if you say they are capable, then they shouldn't be so obedient to human commands, content with a little leftover favor and self-satisfied. In short, it's difficult to determine, so let's leave it at that.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, before the Wei and Jin dynasties, the term "running dog" was not very common. After the Wei and Jin dynasties, through the poems and songs of scholars, running dogs filled the world.</p>
<p>The earliest article praising dogs is probably Bo Xuan's of the Jin dynasty. He wrote a "Rhapsody on the Running Dog" (走狗賦), whose memorable lines include: "Indeed, nothing is as swift as the eagle, nothing as fierce as the tiger, but the good dog's nature combines both strength and martial prowess. Seeking hidden traces, tracking lost trails, as swift as surging waves, as forceful as a startled dragon. Scaling mountains and crossing valleys, not leaving a rabbit in the plains, nor a deer in the forest. It is both swift and unmatched, and leisurely and measured." The thousands of words can be said to exhaust the art of praise. There are many such articles in later generations, so they are not listed here.</p>
<p>As for using "running dog" as a self-designation, some say it existed in the Han dynasty, but it can be reliably traced back to Zheng Banqiao of the Qing dynasty. Niu Yingzhi's "Rainy Window Notes" (雨窗消意錄) records: "Zheng Banqiao loved Xu Qingfend's poems the most, and once engraved a private seal that read, 'Zheng Xie, running dog under the gate of Xu Qingfend.'" This is also a unique way of presenting oneself. Alas, Zheng's affection for dogs can be said to be profound. From then on, the connection between humans and dogs became increasingly inseparable. Descending to modern times, there are many people who are willing to be running dogs to show off their refined tastes. Praising people often involves calling them "running dogs." It can be said that wherever there is well water to drink, the term "running dog" can be used. Fearing that people might forget their origins, I wrote this study on running dogs.</p>

<h3>A Scene of Romance</h3>
<p>— Guang Han</p>
<p>Evening. Inside the library of ×× University. The surroundings are unusually quiet. A wisp of autumn coolness constantly blows in through the windows. Several students are buried in their work, each doing their own thing.</p>
<p>He and she occupy a table in the corner of the room, sitting across from each other, each with a book open, paper spread out, and pen in hand, writing.</p>
<p>Suddenly, he winks at her, passing a piece of paper he has finished writing. She takes it, says nothing, and writes one in return. He reads it and writes another one to pass over.</p>
<p>He and she lock eyes and smile.</p>
<p>He writes another one to pass over, and she writes another one to pass over.</p>
<p>He frowns slightly, and quickly writes another one to pass over.</p>
<p>She tears the paper to pieces and throws them under the table. He hurriedly bends down to pick them up, crumples them into a ball, and holds them tightly.</p>
<p>He glances at her and writes another one to pass over.</p>
<p>She just makes a few strokes on the paper with her pen.</p>
<p>A look of distress suddenly appears on his face. He puts down his pen, stretches, and lets out a long sigh.</p>
<p>She looks a little distressed and writes another one to pass over. Then comes a charming smile.</p>
<p>He sees it, and immediately his frown disappears. He nods, thinks for a while, and writes another one to pass over. He looks out the window.</p>
<p>"No!" she blurts out. The air in the room is shattered by the crisp sound. Several students who are reading look up at the same time, but after a while, they look down again, each doing their own thing. She is a little flustered, her face flushed, and she gives him a sharp glance.</p>
<p>He tries his best to calm himself down and writes another one to pass over.</p>
<p>She shakes her head and writes another one to pass over.</p>
<p>He looks at it, expresses his dissatisfaction, and immediately writes another one to pass over.</p>
<p>She ponders for a long time, looking very troubled.</p>
<p>He and she are silent for a moment. Everything becomes even quieter.</p>
<p>He suddenly gently grasps one of her hands, making a pleading expression. She looks a little scared, half-pushing and half-accepting, her head constantly looking left and right.</p>
<p>She pulls her hand back and writes another one to pass over. Amazing wrist.</p>
<p>He smiles, looking at her adoringly. She lowers her head shyly.</p>
<p>He makes a gesture. He and she put away their drawing tools, tear up the paper scraps, scatter them on the floor, and leave together.</p>
<p>It is getting dark, and the surroundings are still quiet. There are fewer people reading.</p>
<p>On a piece of scrap paper, these few words are scribbled: "Okay! I promise you, Brother ×!"</p>

<h3>Tuesday</h3>
<p>— Yu Sheng</p>
<p>Wednesday, as usual, is the day for prisoners to be visited at the prison. Lianxian, who lives in the attic room, was already planning miserably the night before: cotton clothes are indispensable, the weather is unusually cold like this, the heavy snow is falling violently, and the north wind is like a knife scraping on people's faces, causing bone-chilling shivers. She thought of her husband imprisoned in the human hell, and her heart was broken!</p>
<p>She wandered the streets, buying a set of cotton clothes, and also bought a vegetable box. Back in the small building, she continued her busy work alone, lighting the prepared stove, preparing salty and durable vegetables; at the same time, she repaired her already old socks, and prayed gently in her heart. She thought silently that the things she had mended with her own hands could be worn on his body, and it would be the same as her being by his side, or it could give him some comfort! She also wanted to write a short letter, slip it into the clothes, and attach two dollars, fearing that he might need some pocket money.</p>
<p>When she started preparing to write the letter, her thoughts suddenly stopped, her throat tightened, and sour tears dripped onto the paper little by little. Heavens! What should she write? She pondered for a long time, and finally began to write with tears in her eyes: "Brother! I am here. I came after four days without receiving a letter. Hearing that you were arrested, my heart was so unexpectedly painful! Since things have come to this, there is no way to recover. At present, I only hope that you will take care, take care, take care the third time! I pray day and night that if heaven does not fail us, there will always be hope of seeing the light of day again. Endure everything, brother! I am sending two cotton quilts, a set of cotton clothes, and two pairs of old socks, which I have mended with my own hands. Every line of thread is connected to your sister's uncontrollable tears. There is also a box of side dishes, a toothbrush, toothpaste, and soap each, two small handkerchiefs, and two dollars for pocket money. Don't worry about me, my body is free and healthy! Lian Mei"</p>
<p>After everything was prepared, she fell into contemplation. She fantasized about the happiness when her husband returned in the future, and how she would cherish and love him more than ever before, like life itself! But, thinking again about the danger he was in now, she became timid, and the hope in her mind rapidly decreased to the lowest point. She also thought: it would be good to be sentenced to life imprisonment, as long as life is preserved! All kinds of fantasies, hopes, and fears disturbed and twisted her entire soul that night, and she did not close her eyes all night.</p>
<p>The snow was getting heavier and heavier, and the cold wind constantly pierced into her clothes. She packed the things she should bring, and repeatedly tightened the bulging abdomen. Because of the long journey from her residence to the "Black Terror" prison, she was protecting her nearly pregnant body, which was necessary.</p>
<p>The car was speeding on the bumpy and muddy road. In the desolate fields, there were no pedestrians. In the raging wind and snow, only she and the driver were the unfortunate ones among human beings! Ah! The boundless sorrow seemed to be borne on her heart and the driver's shoulders. In her heart, which was as fiery as an arrow, there was no time to think about anything, only eager to reach the cruel destination.</p>
<p>She lowered her head and walked into the tiger's mouth-like prison gate, registered at a small window, and returned to the corner on the left, leaning against the luggage and waiting on the cold and damp ground. Puddles of water were spitting bone-chilling cold air at her. Many prisoners with crushed limbs were being taken away for interrogation, passing in front of her, with haggard faces, painful hearts, and the clanging of shackles, breaking her entire heart little by little. She thought of her weak husband, how could he endure such torture? Her heart turned cold, her body trembled, and she clenched her hands tightly over her chest!</p>
<p>The soldiers came out with the roll call, and she immediately squeezed forward regardless. "Wang ××, Li ××!" "Chen Zhongxu, no visit allowed!" The soldier, wielding the power of life and death, called out proudly and seemingly angrily. "No visit allowed? Can the things be sent in?" "No visit allowed, of course, the things cannot be taken in." She was disappointed, as if she had fallen backwards from a cliff into a bottomless mountain stream! Finally, she begged a kind old soldier, who agreed to help her inquire, and after much pleading, the things could not be smuggled in either. She felt as if she had been saved, and waited patiently outside.</p>
<p>The luggage was brought out again, and the old soldier also had a sad expression on his face! She trembled as if she had seen a ghost, fearing that her hair would stand on end! She asked quickly: "What's wrong?" "He has been transferred to ×× yesterday, I regret that I can't help you!" "Really? Will it be dangerous to be transferred to ××?" She opened her eyes wide and asked. "To tell you the truth, he was secretly executed last night! And not just him." The sudden news was like a bolt from the blue for her, and she was shocked! Everything was destroyed, the last hope was also cut off, her breathing stopped, and she fell under the sycamore tree by the small pool. The wind was still raging, and snowflakes were hitting her pale face.</p>
<p>In this cruel world, she became a victim of love from then on.</p>
<h3>Further Discussion on Vases and Vase Stands</h3>
<p>— Jing Jia</p>
<p>Since writing the review on vases and vase stands, I had put this matter aside. Yesterday, I read Ms. Hua's article, and I have to cheer myself up and write some more. Although this is not like the "Wen Xuan" and "Zhuangzi" that can cause the world to turn upside down, at least, this is always an "interesting" issue, right?</p>
<p>The so-called "vase," it is said, is "because it looks good, used as a decoration, and has no practical use." Since the name "vase" is applied to female employees, then needless to say, female employees are "decorations" and have no practical use. Of course, I absolutely cannot say that "vase" is a term without any "humiliating" element. However, can ladies eliminate the insult of "vase" by coming up with the term "vase stand" to apply to men and women? Is this kind of Q-style mental victory a legitimate revenge?</p>
<p>Ms. Hua admits that there are "fake golds mixed in" among female employees. In other words, Ms. Hua admits that there are "vases" mixed in among female employees. We know that one rotten apple can spoil a basket of good apples, and a little ink can spoil a piece of white cloth. Because of the weakness of a few people, we are ridiculed as the "sick men of East Asia." We all know that to brush away insults, we must first start with ourselves. Who can say that shouting a few times after Japan occupied the Northeast provinces, "Damn Japanese dwarfs," can wash away our insults?</p>
<p>The person who came up with the term "vase," indeed, I believe he is cheering wildly and receiving praise. Because the term he came up with has been proven by facts. Of course, it is very joyful when one's thoughts can get the approval of the masses. I think Ms. Hua must also be very joyful, right? If the name "vase stand" can be as widely spread as "vase" as Ms. Hua wishes, shouldn't Ms. Hua raise a goblet and have a big drink? Since Ms. Hua knows that the person who came up with the name "vase" will not feel embarrassed at all, then shouldn't Ms. Hua be very happy for the name "vase stand"?</p>
<p>There are indeed quite a few modern male employees who are willing to prostrate themselves at the feet of modern female employees to wait on them. However, I believe that modern male employees will definitely not prostrate themselves before rural girls! A peacock will also display its feathers when it sees people dressed in gaudy red and white. Without vases, where do you put the flowers? Where do you put the stand?</p>
<p>If the name "vase stand" can be as widespread as "vase" as Ms. Hua wishes, not only should the ladies thank her for washing them clean, but even a man like me would prostrate myself at the corner of Ms. Hua's cheongsam and kowtow three times and bow nine times to express my endless gratitude. To be honest, ladies are always luckier than men and women. Female employees can still be a beautiful decoration, while men can't even be a decoration. In the organization, superiors will never scold female employees in person, at most they will say a few words behind their backs: "A vase is always just a vase," but men will be scolded by their superiors in person: "Rice bucket!" At least, a vase is always better than a rice bucket, right? Is there no "humiliation" in the name "rice bucket"? If Ms. Hua can promote men from "rice buckets" to "vase stands," isn't that enough for me to be grateful for?</p>
<p>If we want to talk about equal rights for men and women, I really don't know how to say it well. Since the Shen Bao has had self-employment introductions, someone has statistically shown that 90% of the responses are occupied by women. The budding of women's occupations is the withering of men's occupations! Who can deny it?</p>
<p>If Ms. Hua feels quite satisfied and comforted after having the name "vase stand," then I wish her to be satisfied like that forever!</p>

<h3>The Sorrow of Students</h3>
<p>— Zu</p>
<p>The days have passed so quickly, and it is the beginning of the end of November again. This spring, due to some reasons, I dropped out of school and studied at home. Ah! A whole year is about to be wasted just like this! So-called self-study, where is the result of self-study? I still remember when I was in school, the Chinese teacher gave us a topic in composition class to write: "The Importance of Self-Study," "The Value of Learning Lies in Self-Study." It is said that way, but how difficult and not easy it is to implement! At that time, we all said this (that is, now, there are still many people who say this: "School life is too rigid, the distance between school and social reality is too far too far!") Since this is the case, then the awakened students who have recognized this shortcoming should be how to strive to enthusiastically use society as a school to start learning the practical knowledge that meets social application. However, how easy is it to talk about it! This chaotic contradiction, a society where everything presents an unstable phenomenon, what it gives to us general youth is simply cruelly squeezed and called us to be suffocated to death, where can there be the opportunity for us to study ourselves?</p>
<p>Because of age, although the environment and my ideals are absolutely contradictory, but, because it is contradictory, we only want to work hard to study for a few levels, but the first thing that shows me a warning is the ghost thing "diploma". I can't get this thing, I can't jump over this difficult gate that is being checked strictly. I wear this ghostly thing, of course, makes me feel extremely sad! However, at the same time, I recalled the past, and it made me start to have great doubts about school again! Scene after scene of farcical plays are still clearly reflected in my memory: about the year of the third grade of junior high school, the "teacher" was very careless in class, we students, were still young, knew something, the "teacher" was careless, I was happy to "write freely", before the "teacher" came to class, we wrote on the blackboard, "Talk casually", the "teacher" listened to us the most, so at that time he was also a strange and cute person in our minds. So during class time, everyone talked casually. In the past, when it came to monthly exams, as long as we all said "can't write", the "teacher" would do it for us on the blackboard, and they would copy it, and everyone would get 90 to 100 points; or, if the teacher was stricter, they would try to move the school servant who printed the exam papers, or after the exam, go to the "teacher" to steal it and revise it, or everyone pass or copy the important things in advance on small notes and desks ... The tricks were played as much as possible. In this way, after messing around in school, I got a false transcript. Now, I feel very empty in my heart. Thinking like this, waves rose in my brain again; I thought, even if I could go to university, the biggest doubt would still lurk in my heart: after graduating from university, will I definitely be able to achieve my aspirations? Will I definitely be able to solve my life problems? The factual answer: there are many college graduates who have returned from studying abroad and are unemployed?</p>
<p>Ah: all kinds of things hidden in my heart make people worry: in the past, I entered "Mama Hu" school, and now I feel that everything is empty: I want to seek some practical learning, I resolutely left school and wanted to study myself, I wanted to make up for it, but the result was disappointing, I wanted to step into the door of the school again, but because of the diploma, it hinders my enterprising heart: I opened my eyes wide and looked at the group of unemployed people, the very obvious university students and overseas students also joined, and it made me tremble with fear! Ah, the sorrow of students! The sorrow of youth!</p>

<h3>Childhood Fragments of Memory (7)</h3>
<p>— Lie Huo</p>
<p>However, Mother, after hearing this, uttered a set of persuasive words: "I heard that the county magistrate is an old friend of Teacher Du. There's no question about Teacher Du getting a position in the government office! At least nine out of ten chances are reliable. Go, go! Teacher Du's wife, please don't say such discouraging words, lest Teacher Du hears them and lose heart!" As soon as she finished speaking, she gazed at me and touched my bald head. "You are Teacher Du's disciple, so work hard, and you may also go to the government office in the future! Look, your eldest brother didn't work hard, and it turned into 'Burning cow dung, nothing accomplished' [Note 5]. Your father lost heart and didn't have the courage, so he left your second, third, and fourth brothers at home to handle hoes. You must work hard! Handling hoes is tough, like a beast of burden!"</p>
<p>"Yes, Little Five, you must work hard, so you can also go to the government office in the future, which will be much more comfortable!" Teacher Du's wife laughed heartily.</p>
<p>After Teacher Du's wife left, Mother went to cook lunch.</p>
<p>From then on, the entire village's elementary students began to fear losing their education. The parents were busy searching for a teacher, and they found a Mr. Liu. I still don't know Mr. Liu's full name to this day, but I can still vaguely remember his nickname: "Loose Antique," and some also called him "Shorty Pine." However, the former was more commonly used because he was indeed quite antique in character, and although he wasn't short to an extreme degree, he was still an inch or two shorter than the average person.</p>
<p>This Mr. Liu was indeed a bit odd. He always had puffed cheeks and a mournful face. Sometimes he would smile, but it was a bitter smile. It was said that when he was young, he had some intelligence and was very good at memorization. At that time, people said that he had the hope of passing the children's exam. However, when he went to take the exam, he ran into bad luck and "failed the exam." Therefore, he was quite frustrated. When talking about the examiners, he would grumble a few words, saying, "They are some things with no eyes!" After saying this, he seemed to feel much better, and then he would smile, with the bitter smile probably stemming from this. However, he did not lose heart because of this. Instead, he worked even harder. He desperately picked up a complete Four Books and read it over and over again, memorizing all the annotations. However, he took the exam again, three times, and countless times, but he was still Mr. Liu in a long cloth gown, and the red button on the official hat still did not develop a liking for his scalp. This made him frustrated to the point of being dumbfounded. As a result, he didn't even have the confidence to write clear and coherent letters for the neighbors (Note 6), even though he was very familiar with the complete Four Books.</p>
<p>However, the people in the village still had a strong belief in him, as devout as women's belief in Guanyin, saying that he was the only great Confucian scholar within dozens of miles. They would ask him for advice when they had something to do, and writing letters was a given. They were especially happy to send their children to him to study.</p>
<p>When the "rice-harvesting break" was over, Mr. Liu's private school opened its doors. Father sent me there. "After finishing the Analects and Mencius, we'll read the Great Learning later. Let's start reading Elementary Learning now!" Father offered his opinion to Mr. Liu. Mr. Liu didn't quite agree. His opinion was this: "The Five Classics and Four Books are the words of the sages,"</p>
<p>"The ultimate purpose of the great Dao is in them, so they must be read! As for Elementary Learning, it is inevitably a bit vulgar. It's okay for merchants and peddlers to read it, but for a Confucian scholar to read it would be a waste of time!" Father replied evasively: "Yes, I just want to have him become a peddler, so he's studying Elementary Learning! If Mr. Liu has time, please explain the Analects and Mencius to him in detail."</p>
<p>The matter was quickly decided, and I began to read Elementary Learning.</p>

<h3>A Few "Bit Players" Regarding Hollywood (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Xi Wen</p>
<p>A big star's every frown and smile, every sigh and cough, are all worthy of being printed in large letters in newspapers and magazines, making us linger and admire them. But a big star is not a big star simply by performing a solo act. As the saying goes, a beautiful peony needs green leaves to support it, and a general achieves fame on the backs of ten thousand corpses. There are leading actors on the stage, but the play cannot be performed without those who carry flags and hold umbrellas. Therefore, in a film, in addition to the big stars, there must also be many supporting actors. Among the supporting actors, there is one group that we most easily overlook, but which is very important: a group of "bit players." No film can be made without bit players and be entirely taken care of by the stars. Even star-studded films like "Grand Hotel" and "Dinner at Eight," which will soon be coming to Shanghai, cannot be entirely composed of famous stars. Therefore, these "bit players" are like extras on the stage, not important but indispensable. For example, if Greta Garbo is sitting in a beautiful car, there must be a chauffeur. That chauffeur is a bit player. When Clark Gable runs into a bar and gets into a fight with a drunk, that drunk is also a bit player. Chauffeurs, robbers, politicians, laundresses, policemen, and all other minor roles that appear briefly in the film and then disappear are called bit players.</p>
<p>Although they are bit players, they each have their own specialties. Those who play doctors always play doctors; those who play priests always play priests. They never get mixed up. And because they always play the same role, over the years, they become familiar to the audience without realizing it. So we often see someone in a film and unknowingly shout, "Isn't that the doorman from that other film?" And they themselves specialize in one role, becoming skilled through practice and playing it perfectly. I will now name a few of the most famous bit players so that you can pay a little more attention when you watch a film next time. Even if you don't want to remember their names, recognizing their faces is very interesting.</p>
<p>The first and most famous bit player is Eric Mayne. You are guaranteed to have seen him many times. His specialty is playing doctors, priests, lawyers, and diplomats because he has a long beard, curly hair, and a distinguished appearance. Because he is serious in demeanor, he can play experts of all kinds without looking like an amateur. As for his background, he is Irish and studied theology at Westminster in London. Strangely, he later gave up theology and went into acting. He excelled in Shakespearean operas, and he is still a Shakespearean drama lecturer at the Los Angeles Public Library. Unfortunately, he is too out of touch with the times. He has fallen from being a leading actor on the stage to a bit player in films. In addition, he had very bad luck; his wife died, and both of his sons were killed in the European war. He became a lonely old man, living in a small hotel in Hollywood and often going out for walks alone. He is neatly dressed and dignified in demeanor, and one can tell at a glance that he is an English gentleman, but who would know that he is a marginalized and heartbroken person?

<p>It is a most obvious fact that American films strive for perfection in form. This certainly proves that they have made great progress in technology, and at the same time, in order to develop their business, they must also have good forms to attract audiences. This is true of musical films, and it is also true of horror films outside of musical films.</p>
<p>Speaking of horror films, we immediately think of "The Mummy," which uses the resurrection of ancient corpses as a gimmick, and its allure is conceivable. But because of its absurdity and lack of foundation, it will inevitably be rejected by progressive audiences. Because of this, smart filmmakers have to look for materials that can replace the supernatural outside of the "supernatural." "The Mystery of the Wax Museum" is undoubtedly Warner Brothers' clever trick. The filmmaker exaggerated the assassination event as much as possible in order to obtain the same magic as the supernatural.</p>
<p>However, our requirements for stories are the truthfulness and universality of the story, and in terms of the content of this work, we cannot obtain the completeness of the above two conditions. This can be proved by examples.</p>
<p>We certainly acknowledge that under the structure of real society, everything is a commodity, and so-called art is also a disguised form of commodity. Therefore, it is not contradictory to the current social system for wax figure makers to use all methods to seize profits. At the same time, the playwright tells us that sculptors are ultimately not easy to support and can only set fire to their own works in an attempt to obtain compensation from the insurance company. But we have to ask, why must this sculptor use the corpses of modern people as models when he wants to sculpt portraits of ancient people? This is very far-fetched. Moreover, the wax figures he sculpted in New York are the same as those sculpted in London. Does this mean that the ones sculpted in London also use corpses as models? This is enough to prove that the playwright, in order to make this sculptor kill people, tried his best to come up with this very far-fetched reason and construct this untrue and bizarre story, even if it exists, it is very accidental and not a true portrayal of daily life.</p>
<p>Therefore, we can prove that it is indeed not easy to make money with film art, especially in this time of financial panic and weakened purchasing power. Although the propagandists must say in grand terms that this is "an attack on the dangers of modern art trends," what we understand in the film is the exposure of the madness of the producer himself! It is certainly dangerous to use human bodies as molds to make wax figures, but it is even more dangerous to use such a bizarre story as the content of a work.</p>
<p>Speaking of horror films, we immediately think of the makeup of "The Mummy," and the magic of that makeup is truly admirable. Here, the method of using rosin to glue the face is used in the same way. It is true that the sculptor Yegud's face becomes so terrifying after being burned, but this cannot be achieved without advanced makeup techniques. (The Mummy's makeup embalms corpses, while here, the makeup is for people with burned faces, which should be more reasonable than the former.) At the same time, Frederic March's makeup in "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde" and Lon Chaney's makeup as a thousand-faced man are sufficient to illustrate the progress of theatrical art in science.</p>
<p>Speaking of the thousand-faced man, the acting skills here are similar to those of Lon Chaney. Lion Alwill is also worthy of great praise. When he was in the burning wax museum, he watched his beloved wax figures melt and be destroyed one by one, and that profound expression gave us the most powerful impression. In addition to the ugly face he disguised, the original appearance of Yegud was also very good. Naturally, there is a symbolic meaning in the fact that the woman "breaks" the mask to reveal the ugliness, but it is not very appropriate in terms of reason. If she "scratches" it, it would show that the mask is soft, because wearing a hard mask all the time would not be realistic and have lively expressions.</p>
<p>Speaking of acting again, the female lead Glenda Farrell is truly a comedic genius. Her fluent speech and lively performance are just right, but her name is not on the poster, while Fay Wray, who is not important, is used as promotional material. This shows the contradictory phenomenon in business, naturally because Farrell is not as famous as Wray. We don't have to belittle Fay Wray because her role is not important, but she is still equal to her role in "The Most Dangerous Game." Among the other supporting actors, the one who played Spryluk (the sculptor's assistant) also performed very well.</p>
<p>The director's skills, like those of general horror films, are very capable of grasping the audience's tense emotions. In particular, using a happy crook to write this tense plot feels like a new and lovely approach. As for the climax of the first part and the final climax, they are both handled very appropriately. Among them, there are certainly many terrifying scenes that use mechanical sets or make people suspicious and fearful to deliberately create a shocking effect, but things like the croaking of toads and the discovery of whiskey in an open coffin are very clever.</p>
<p>Because it is a color film, it feels more beautiful in form. The best are the displays in the wax museum, the burning of the wax museum, the theft of corpses in the funeral home, and the hanging of彩 at the New Year. If it were not in color, the above scenes would never have achieved such results.</p>
<p>Finally, one more sentence, the film production skills of American films have indeed made great progress, but their capital is also really not small!</p>
<h3>"Wild Camellia" Reviews "Maid of The Mountain"</h3>
<p>— Moore</p>
<p>Since criticism that emphasizes ideological concepts is generally regarded as "formulaic" criticism and is rejected indiscriminately, this crisis will inevitably destroy correct film criticism if it develops further. Therefore, in one context, I emphasized the ideological aspect of film art. Naturally, form is determined by content. Precisely because form is determined by content, those who can truly grasp the ideological concepts of film will inevitably solve its form. In current foreign films, we often see exactly the same form (this is certainly not in the narrow sense), and this complete sameness of form must be because its content has something in common. (This is certainly not a mechanical reference to the story.)</p>
<p>"Wild Camellia" is a so-called "martial arts musical" film. If we only vulgarly introduce its form, then not to mention the readers, even ordinary "critics" will be deceived by its form. Because until now, new "artistic concepts" have not yet been established among our general "critics." We can only start from the aspect of meaning to expose the toxicity of form.</p>
<p>The producer of "Wild Camellia" is suffering from the harm of officials, just like all modern citizens. Therefore, in this film, he created a "chieftain" to play with the newly arrived and tyrannical governor. He deliberately wrote the "chieftain" as very outstanding. The "residents of the town" "plead for help" because of the tyranny of the new governor. This shows that the "chieftain" was invited by the people, is for the "people," and not for "profit."</p>
<p>However, our producer, although resentful of the officials at the time, does not feel resentful of the social system that promotes the tyranny and corruption of officials, and the laws that do not give the people the right to dismiss them, but deeply supports it. Therefore, he does not use the power of the people to dismiss or reject this tyrannical new governor, but makes the people beg the "chieftain" for help. At the same time, he puts the release of the captured "chieftain" not under the power of the people, but under the effectiveness of the old governor's powers, which still have ten minutes left; this shows that our producer is a thorough and complete supporter of the old system and old laws.</p>
<p>In terms of the story itself, some places are not clear.</p>
<p>First, before the new governor takes office, the people know that he is a tyrannical official, and even if he has been an official elsewhere, the people should not seek help from the "chieftain."</p>
<p>Second, since the "chieftain" has tied up the new governor and disguised himself, how can the people in the place who know that the new governor is tyrannical not recognize the new governor at all? If the people love the "chieftain," then the "chieftain" should naturally be more familiar to the people. Why must they wait for Tuo Sha's announcement before capturing him?</p>
<p>Third, since the tyranny of the new governor is known to all, the old governor naturally knows it too. At the same time, the old governor also hates the tyranny of the new governor and releases the chieftain. Why did he release him later and then capture him earlier?</p>
<p>There is no need to mention other small places.</p>
<p>Because this story has many songs and dances, the director has overlooked many places and deliberately lengthened the song and dance scenes, which can naturally make this film more "sexy," but it also makes it more vulgar.</p>
<p>Under this story, the actors naturally have a lot of acting to do, so everyone is working very hard!</p>
<h3>The Nursery in "Life"</h3>
<p>The shooting of "Life," directed by Fei Mu of Lianhua Film Company, is now nine-tenths complete, and the entire film can be completed soon. In this play, the lives of the two women played by Ruan Lingyu and Lin Chuchu are extremely rough. Ruan Lingyu wanders and roams throughout her life, and Lin Chuchu lives with children throughout her life. A scene of a nursery was shot indoors a few days ago. Xing Shaomei bought a large number of cradles and children's supplies in advance. Lin Chuchu was made up as an old woman, and her demeanor was very vivid. The office staff of the nursery are all old men with white hair and beards. Because this scene required a large number of babies, many women gathered in the photography studio with their children before the shooting began. When the shooting began, they happily put their children in the cradles, which was very interesting, but because the children were separated from their mothers, they all cried loudly, but because of their crying, several exceptionally wonderful shots were filmed.</p>
<h3>Film Novel The Weakness of Women My Weakness (5)</h3>
<p>— Fusheng</p>
<p>Lorna came in. He told Lola Morning that she was about to meet Gilad. Lola asked him why he had to meet him at the fashion exhibition. Lorna said that he never went to any public gatherings, but the Ting Fashion Exhibition was something he couldn't miss, because he was the deputy manager of the Gregerie lingerie company. For the sake of business, he couldn't not go. So Lorna taught her some tips on how to deal with Gilad. He had two special hobbies. One was eating raw carrots, and the other was old stamps. He said, "You should tell him that you also like old stamps. If it comes to the point where you have to, you might as well eat some carrots. I know this is too difficult for you, but..." Lola said softly, "As long as Lorna tells me to, let alone eat carrots, I will swallow his entire set of old stamps." Lorna said, "You have to find a way to make him kiss you... Come, I'll teach you, this is something women can't teach!" Lola thought that kissing Lorna shouldn't be taken too seriously, because it was just like dancing or playing golf. Lorna didn't really want her to kiss him. But when Lola shyly pursed her lips, how... it seemed like it was real. Lorna smiled, "Lola, do you know yourself, you kiss really well."</p>
<p>The next night, Lola and Iv stood on the stairs, looking down at the noisy exhibition below. She supported Iv, her hands were cold, and her knees were shaking. They watched many models walking on the stage in various fashions. The French tailor Lanier was squeezing around in the crowd. Suddenly Lanier stopped and talked to a thin, middle-aged man with glasses. Iv pulled Lola tightly and said to her, "The one with glasses is Gilad Gregorie, the deputy manager of Gregorie lingerie company." Lola looked over and saw Gilad, she shuddered. Diana encouraged her from the side: "You can't desert at the last minute. You have to know that if you don't do well, Lorna will become a poor man."</p>
<p>Before going downstairs, Iv, Maureen, and others taught her a lot of gossip. So they went downstairs. Lorna introduced Lola to Gilad. Gilad stared blankly at Lola, revealing a very silly look. Lola almost laughed, but she held back and pretended to be very dignified and said to Gilad: "Why don't we go out to the veranda and count the stars in the sky?" Gilad immediately agreed with her and walked out. He told Lola that he liked to watch the stars in the sky very much: he had counted the stars in the sky one day, and there were a total of 12,308. As they were talking on the veranda, Lola heard the sound of turning silk from behind the flower pots, knowing that Lorna and those women were eavesdropping there. Okay, let them listen. So she said to Gilad: "Lorna is extremely annoying to me. He only knows women, and has no other abilities besides that!" After Lola finished speaking, she vaguely heard Lorna's angry scolding, and she was very happy in her heart. (To be continued)</p>
