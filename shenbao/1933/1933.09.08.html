<p>日本自發動九一八事變以來。即擴大其。軍事行動橫行東亞　奪我國東。北四省之不足。更進而製擊熱河擾亂關內我國人民固備受其殘酷之蹂　而笑美各國。在華利益。亦到處感受威脅。我國爲實力所限未能從事於積極之鬭爭。而英美各國。亦苦於其國內之經濟恐慌不敢輕易挑釁。日本窺見英美之弱點知其遠隔重洋。雖擁重兵而莫可如何。於是。野心益肆又恃。其地理之便。在軍事上易於控　現勢。一面保持其旣得勝得。一面努力防守對美則扼　小笠原島。南出加洛林馬拉林兩羣島。進可以取菲律濱奪關島窺夏威夷退亦足以保持日本與東北三省之經濟聯絡。對英則借毫灣澎湖島以蹴破英國在遠東所伏海軍水雷之香港。使其印度洋之關門丨新嘉坡亦不易支持。且日本對馬來對印度各土著民族。均極力拉攏培殖在當地一般社會之濳伏勢力。而於工業製造品。則盡力傾消使英國出品。感受經濟上之威脅。此猶爲較顯著之事實。再進而窺察日本最近三年來軍事費用之龐大更足驚人。就其國庫全部支出之百分率而論。已爲準戰時預算。毫無疑義。明年度海軍支出總額逹六億八千萬日金。而新規要求有四億三千萬日金四年建艦計劃。丨至一九三六年倫敦條約期滿爲止丨總計支出億九千萬明年度建艦費一項計一億八千萬　日金。其目的何在不問可知矣美國於此。亦豈肯放棄東方之市塲。坐令假想敵海軍勢力之獨大以是乃亦有三十二隻新建艦之計劃。初擬在今後三年間支出兩億三千八百萬美金。每年平均支出七千百餘萬。以爲競爭軍備之費後見日本擴張軍備愈力且更加以產業復興之計劃於是遂亦不能不以軍事工業之振興而發展其產業。故於建造新艦費。數亦增至一億一千萬美金。建造飛機及水陸設備</p>
<p>費則逹一千萬。幾超過原計劃一倍其用意亦可相見。近日報發表海軍當局對於美艦隊留駐太平洋之言論。謂遠東問題已平復。而美艦隊猶令留駐於太平洋者。由於美總統對遠東問題過於關心之故日本因亦不能不加倍注意然其實美之所以關心遠東亦正以日本之過於關心也兩方競爭之心事躍於紙上。</p>
<p>英國本以保持現狀爲得策然美旣蹶起於大西洋彼岸南美諸國。已完全被美金所支配，即加拿大所受之經濟影響亦以美國爲較大。英帝國如再無適當之自救方法。恐不免爲過去西班牙之續是以渥太華英帝國濟會議而後。英帝國經濟聯盟成立。遂亦不能不抛棄傳統之留易自由自由政策轉而入於極端保護主義閉關政策之旗　下。一方面見今日世界之經濟競爭皆隱隱挾巨大之海陸空軍。爲其對外貿易發展之支擋點日美兩國旣已盡量充實軍備。英國豈能獨後。蓋欲爲保持其海上貿易之地位。維繫散處世界各地之殖民市塲計。則積極擴張海軍。又爲勢所不能免也</p>

<p>— 瞻廬</p>
<p>英國平津發現一隻背生兩翼的奇貓，也會試飛，但，水能振翼　空，被人棄擲道左，今則蓄養於牛津動物院中。天下之大　眞是無奇不有。</p>
<p>英人中崇尙迷信者，厭見此畸形的貓，倘不能歸還原主，便要撲殺此貓，以絕　異。我得了這個消息，很　着飛貓不平。英人厭惡飛貓，只爲貓不該生翼，不該試飛，畸形的貓，殺之無赦。然而天下畸形的東西正多咧，魚是游和行的，大洋中却有飛魚，騰空而去，霎時重落水面。蛇是爬行的，變部中却有飛蛇，會得振翅入林，摶食小鳥。旣有畸形的飛魚飛蛇獨不許有畸形的飛貓，在道理上，未免講不過去。</p>
<p>自從航空發逹，飛行空御空而行，視爲常事；不會飛的人，現在也會飛了。而且，一開殺機，便忘却了人道主義，許多轟炸機上的空軍，在空中肆毒，比親插翅虎　得厲害，簡直是來了一隊飛天夜义，不异惜戕害下方民衆，人且要插翅，何况貓呢？何况貓呢？何况這頭貓雖有兩翼，尙不能高飛呢？</p>
<p>貓有捕鼠的本能，旣然有了飛鼠，便該有飛貓。蝙蝠一名飛鼠，它是獸類中的敗類，禽類中的奸細，非禽非獸，亦禽亦獸，倘没有貓兒去制服它，那麽，蝙蝠　行，身隸兩國，不是成了蝙蝠世界麽？貓，雖能捕鼠，却不能捕蝙蝠在空中打轉，貓兒　好昂着頭呆看，宛比癩蝦蟆想吃天鵝肉一般。吾以爲牛津動物院中的兩翼貓，非但，不可撲殺它，而且，須得　　飼養，傳布它的種子，養成它的飛行本領！世界上有了飛貓，那麽，一輩『又做師娘又做鬼一的蝙蝠同志，不是便可歛跡？麽？呵呵！</p>

<p>在紙見到，嘴上聽到的種種鬼蜮技倆，我總没有磁到過，雖是我不算老上海，但上海的門檻，也　得一點，誰知前夜有人來掂我的斤量了。</p>
<p>我剛從小廣寒聽大鼓出來·爲了避免許多意外的麻煩、雖是短距離而雇了街車還逆旅。　近漢口路石路的交叉地方，忽地背後有人喊：</p>
<p>『黃包　　慢點！』</p>
<p>那位黃包車夫不知是經騐的敎訓，還是給人追着抓住的關係，當眞站住了。我以爲或者不留神，带破了行人的衣裳，要賠償了。誰知趕上來的，乃是一個黑衣夜行者，面目看不淸楚，是不是猙獰？但説話却狠　人怦怦地心跳。他説：</p>
<p>『帮帮忙』</p>
<p>我那時正握了十六個銅子，預備給車錢的，我一壁連串説『　不』一壁注意他的動作，可笑！（這是以後廻想而笑，當時那裏笑得出。）他右手攀住了車蓬桿子，左手伸在腰裏摸索，這是無疑的，要把人人怕見的手槍給我見見了。</p>
<p>不知是不是他的空城計的藝術還不高明呢？還是他也　破我是一個酸丁，没有血的？他就先説一句略具硬　的話：</p>
<p>『眞的没有？』</p>
<p>緊接着又説了一句軟化的話：</p>
<p>『多少帮一點忙丨』</p>
<p>我那時靈機一動，急忙把車錢授給他説：</p>
<p>『就是這一點拿去罷丨』</p>
<p>這個下文，眞出乎意外了。他竟鄙夷不屑地，把右手一放，旋轉身子就走，嘴裏咕着説：</p>
<p>『銅板誰要丨』</p>
<p>可是我聽得了這一句話，如同得了奉天承運皇帝詔曰：『恕卿無血算　晦氣，欽此丨』</p>
<p>這一幕滑稽劇，是我生活史上的新紀錄，或者老上海見了也平淡無奇但至少可以供茶餘酒後的談資啊。</p>
<p>我在寫完這劇本後·要裝一個題目，想到我們蘇州有一句老話，呌做『路極無君子。』意是説，到了窮極無聊，走上絕路時，没有君子之風了。但我倒要頌揚那位黑衣夜行者，是一個『路極君子』呢。</p>

<p>所以『牛郎織女』的故實，是很有趣的，而拿科學家的實騐來觀察，那未，就拆穿了。自新曆厲行以來，而每年當那廢曆七七的一宵，有許多婦女們還在依著舊習惯，吟『七夕今宵看碧霄，牛郎織女度河橋，家家乞巧望秋月，穿盡紅絲幾百條』，照他們的意思，祇曉得『織女』，『牛郎』要讓吾一男子去膜拜，然而徧繙　堆中，竟找不出獨咏『牛郎』的玩意兒，這眞古人的心理，不能揣測他是怎様？難道以前例『重女輕男』的　個例證麽！</p>

<p>今晨驚聞山人之耗，疾走至　格路中國殯儀館哭之，斗室逼隘，赫然屍在，未睹白馬，臨衹有靑蠅之弔，四句不面，人天遽别，就大郎詢其遺著，則以苦次未及整理對，文人結局，寂寞至此，旣傷逝者，行自念也。顧念子雲已矣，掇拾叢殘，代　流播，後死之責，世多桓譯，當不任其零　湮没也。餘哀未盡。逹以四聯，自愧不文，或足槪其生平云。</p>

<p>— 胡麗文</p>
<p>天氣雖已交了秋可是熱得比　天還厲害；汗整天不息地　在流，頭腦是有此昏昏然的想寫封家信去安慰母親，但執着筆，又不能作一詞；眞的，敎我寫些什麽話好呢？離别故鄕已經好幾年了，工作束爲了我，使我連片刻休息的時間　没有，更何從得着回鄕的機會！母親幾次寫信來問我的近况，當然的，我不能把這些話告訴伊，爲着怕傷了伊的心，我雖然不願騙伊，對於這件事，我是不能不騙伊了，我的回信裡，總是説我的一切都很好</p>
<p>。</p>
<p>今天從工裡回來，汗已經濕透了我的一身，我照例洗了澡換了衣裳後，便坐在這間木盒式的房子裡，開了電燈，想看書，可是心裡似有一塊不可磨滅的　貼在上面一様，才看得兩行，便把它抛掉了。我覺得煩悶在啃嚼我的心。我很快地走到窗前，望着南　的天，在那裡，有一團團敗絮似的黑雲，追　　湧上來；在黑雲底下，就是我的故鄕呀</p>
<p>忽然一陣風拂過我的面類，黑雲却越湧越多了，漸漸漫了全天空；　　　　第一番的斜脚雨，跟着　　，正對着窗口　進。我忙關了窗，退去倒在床上，一切雜念像箭一様攢在我的心頭，我想哭，我掩着臉，淚從指縫裡　下來。天氣似乎已經轉凉了些，雨點打着庭前的芭蕉　和玻璃窗，發出像戰鼓似的急鳴。室內只電燈眨着眼，對我冷笑。我恨　了，　了一個身，把臉伏在枕上，我情願死，情願自殺了一個，我詛咒一切的人，討厭一切的人，他們的話，都是騙人的，他們可以用錢買了你的身軀，買了你的自由。但是，我捨不得慈愛的母親，所以我現　在活着，爭扎着，雖然活着也没有趣味。</p>
<p>我不知在什麽時候已經回到故鄕來了。我跨進屋子，就看見我的姊妹在竈下燒飯，炊烟充滿了一屋子。我忘記了在我的肩上還負着一個沈重的包裏，我跳上前去，呌了一聲　姊。伊給起頭來，看見是我，連忙丢下了手裡一根　的細柴，跑來和我握手，伊笑着對我説：</p>
<p>『我知道你今天一定要回來，所以我燒了許多你　歡喜吃的菜，等你來吃。』</p>
<p>伊伸出一個手指指着靠壁一張舊桌子上的碗伊又報告我；母親病了，在房裡。我跟伊走到母親房裡來。母親在床上，臉色很蒼白，這情景，在我的心中，感到一半甜，一半辛酸，我瘋狂似的奔到床前，我想説話，話太多了，不知從那裡説起。母親看見我來，愁慘的臉上現出悲喜　集的神色，伊伸出手來摸着我的頭説</p>
<p>『秀兒，你回來了！』</p>
<p>『是的，我回來了，母親！』</p>
<p>母親拍拍床沿呌我坐。我把肩上的包裏卸下，交給姊姊，便坐在床沿上。母親着我的手，呌我告訴伊我在外面做的事情，我不敢老實説出，我編了一番假話講給伊聽，伊搖搖頭，似乎不肯相信·忽然淚珠從伊深陷的眼眶裡流下來，伊咽哽着説：</p>
<p>『秀兒丨你不要騙我，你瘦了，瘦了許多了，你在那邊一定不很舒服？』『不！那邊很舒服？』</p>
<p>無論如何，不能告訴伊，我只能騙伊騙到底</p>

<h3 id="c244">由聾而啞 <a href="#c244" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e244" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">244</a></h3>
<p>— 洛文</p>
<p>醫生告訴我們，有許多啞子，是並非喉舌不能説話的，只因爲從小就耳朶聾，聽不見大人的言語，無可師法，就以爲誰也不過張着口嗚嗚唖唖，他自然也只好嗚嗚唖唖了。所以勃蘭兑斯（ＧＢｒａｎｃｅｓ）歎丹麥文學的衰微時，曾説：文學的創作，幾乎完全死滅了。人間的或社會的無論怎様的問題，都不能提起感興、或則除在新聞和雜誌之外，絕不能惹起一點論爭。我們看不見强烈的獨創的創作。加以對於獲得外國的精神生活的事，現在幾乎絕對的不加顧及。于是精神上的『聾』，那結果，就也招致了『唖』來。（十九世紀文學的主潮第一卷自序）</p>
<p>這幾句話，也可以移來批評中國的文藝界。這現象，並不能全歸罪于壓迫者的壓迫，五四運動時代的啟蒙運動者和以後的反對者，都應該分負責任的。前者急于事功，竟没有譯出什麽有價值的書籍，後者則故意遷怒，至駡翻譯者爲媒婆，有些靑年更推波助瀾，有一時期，還至于連人地名下注一原文，以便讀者參考時，也就詆之曰『衒學』。</p>
<p>今竟何如？三開間店面的書舖，四馬路上還不算少，但那裏面滿架是薄薄的小本子，倘要尋一部巨册，眞如披沙揀金之難。自然，生得又高又胖並不就偉人，做得多而且繁也决不就是名著，而况還有『剪貼』。但是，小小的一本『什麽ＡＢＣ』裏，却也决不能包羅一切學術文藝的。一道濁流，不如一杯淸水的乾淨而澄明，但蒸溜了濁流的一部分，却就有許多杯淨水在。</p>
<p>因爲多年買空賣空的結果，文界就荒凉了，文章的形式雖然比較的整齊起來，但戰鬭的精神却比先前有退無進。文人雖因捐班或互捧，很快的成名，但爲了出力的吹，殼子大了，裏面反顯得更加空洞。于是誤認這空虚爲寂寞，像煞有介事的説給讀者們；其甚者還至于擺出他心的腐爛來，算是一種內面的寳貝。散文，在文苑中算是成功的，但試看今年的選本，便是前三名，也卽令人有『貂不足，狗尾續』之感。用　穀來養靑年，是决不會壯大的，將來的成就，目要更渺小，那模様，可看尼采所描寫的『末人』。</p>
<p>但紹介國外恩潮，翻譯世界名作，凡是運輸精神的糧食的航路，現在幾乎都被聾唖的製造者們堵塞了，連洋人走狗，富户　郎，也會來哼哼的冷笑一下。他們要掩住靑年的耳朶，使之由聾而唖，枯涸渺小，成爲『末人』，非弄成大家只能看富家兒和小　三所賣的春宮，不肯罷手。甘爲泥土的作者和譯者的奮鬭，是已經到了萬不可緩的時候了，這就是竭力運輸些切實的精神的糧食，放在靑年們的周圍，一面將那些聾唖的製造者送回黑洞和朱門裏南去。</p>
<h3 id="c245">文人的悲哀 <a href="#c245" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e245" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">245</a></h3>
<p>— 豁篔</p>
<p>閲六日申報本埠新聞，知道靑年作家</p>
<p>是解脱，而且他幸而不死於刀爼，不死於溝　，而是『壽終正寢』在紅十字會醫院，總算是『徼天之福』了，這，正用不着我們爲他傷感哀悼。</p>
<p>我認識他還不到半年，每次見面，總覺提他『面有菜色』，這，可以證明他是長期困頓於半飢餓狀態之中。聽説他曾坐過牢，受過非刑，生活像一把鋭利的刀子一様，將他寸寸剖割，又像一塊千鈞巨石一様，將他牢實地壓榨，然而他終始不爲生活所屈伏，不爲環境所同化，他情願嚼粗糙的大餅，不願嚼自已的人格，情願餓死，不屑將自己零碎拍賣，每次見面，他那種似乎疲敝而又十分剛毅的神氣，總令我爲之肅然起敬。在這時代，他不幸生來便没有带來做『狗』的天性，他的挨凍挨餓，以至坐牢受刑，也許正是『活該』。然而這一點就正是彭空煌之所以令我追念的地方。</p>
<p>他是死在紅十字會醫院三等病房中當然、他之死一方面是因爲病，而另一方面也就是因爲貧。他死後，遺有寡婦孤兒，死者不得葬，生者不得活。一個爲改造社會而努力着的作家，社會對他的報酬，却是如此其冷酷，我想，這纔眞是文人的悲哀。</p>
<p>於此，我想到，現在的一部分眞的靠賣文而不是靠賣人格吃飯的文人們，應當不問彼此在文藝上的派别如何，誠心誠意的組織起來，以人類偉大之同情心爲出發點，從事於生活上之互助，遇着像現在彭君之死不得葬，所遺妻孥不得活的事情，也就可以藉此種互助之方式爲之安頓。</p>
<p>但這也許只是我個人的理想，因爲在目前中國的文壇上，正流行着『人吃人』的活劇，『互助』，當然是會被目爲『腐儒迂論』的了。</p>
<h3 id="c246">海濱之夜（續） <a href="#c246" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e246" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">246</a></h3>
<p>— 冰瑩</p>
<p>『不，我們還要前進，一直到有燈光的地方爲止。』晨堅决地説。</p>
<p>『前面石頭太多，地下又濕，很難走，横豎是海邊，那里還不是和這里一様。』</p>
<p>『不！我們不管牠石頭不石頭，濕不濕，總之我們一定要前進，走到那有燈光的地方爲止。』</p>
<p>『燈光嗎？那是一只小船在海上行走，你瞧，我們越前進，牠越和我們距離得遠了，這様追下去，恐怕追到天亮也趕不上牠。』</p>
<p>倒是心的發現，調和了兩人的衝突，就在距離游泳池不遠的地方，三人一同坐下了。　　細沙上是這般軟得可愛，好像坐在天鵝絨般的地毯上一般，凉透入骨的滋味，又像走進了水晶宮。心和晨都躺下了，只有珠還是坐着，她是一位老大姐，生怕弄　了衣服或者濕氣侵害她，使她腰痛，因此無論如何她是不躺的。</p>
<p>没有聲音了，她們現在各人在享受各人的快樂，各人在幻着想各人的將來。</p>
<p>『假若有一個機會我能建築一座小房子在活濱，每天晚上我同二三好友出來散步，看月光和海水擁抱，聽海潮和柔風密語，淸晨在海邊吸收新鮮的空氣，看美麗的太陽上昇，白天，别人熱得要死的時候，我却開了四面的窗子讓凉爽的海風吹進來給我看書，倦了，便讓睡神带我到甜美的夢境去···一切我都不需要，只要有個機會給我過一下這様的生活，我這一生便幸福了！』</p>
<p>這是珠的希望。</p>
<p>『靜靜地讓我躺在這裏吧，不要醒來，永遠地讓我享受像今夜一般的自然美景。這美麗的月亮，洪大的濤聲，偉大的海溶化了我的靈魂，什麽夢想我都没有，只願我永遠地這様躺着，像今夜一般的月，海，風永遠地不離開我。』</p>
<p>晨是科學的，但在這一刹那，完全忘掉了他的志趣，存在他腦海中的只有一個盡量地享受自然美景的目的，她願意緊緊地抓住這一刹那，她願夜，這様美麗的夜永遠地不滅。　　只有心，這可憐的孩子的確太苦了、一方面她把海潮比成了時代，她説革命的怒潮正像海水一般，潮來時誰也不願抵抗，牠可以掃　一切障碍，洗凈一切齷齪，冲毀一切堅固的樊堤。她愛海，就是因了海的偉大，海水的雄壯，每一個浪花相擊的聲音她認爲都是生命之力，非但海，而且是人們的生命之力。她是要投身在革命的洪爐中，犧牲在鮮紅的血泊裏的；可是另一方面，她愛了海的靜默，海的温柔和綠的海水的美麗，她願就在這淡淡的月光之下慢步地走進海裏，讓雄壯的海濤奏着輓歌，温柔的海風，輕輕地撫摸她浮在碧波上的屍骸。月姐和星星放出慈祥的光輝爲她追悼。就這様靜悄悄地没有一個人知道，除了月亮，星光，風，海之外，她離開了這苦惱的人間，實現了『我的屍骸不願讓任何人看到』的理想。</p>
<p>夜深了，風聲漸漸地尖鋭起來·海浪的聲音更來得洪大了，潮水已漲到了她們躺着的脚下。心很想實行她的理想，可是旁邊還有兩個阻碍她的人。</p>
<p>因了珠的催促，她們忍心地離别了海，踏着月色懶洋洋地步上了寂寞的歸途。</p>

<p>— 阿英</p>
<p>（四）禁東坡文</p>
<p>蘇東坡的文章，也曾被禁過，這眞是一件令現代人驚異的事。我在費補之的『梁溪漫志』第七卷裏，看到一則一禁東坡文』的記載説：</p>
<p>宣和間，申禁東坡文字甚嚴。有士人竊携坡集出城，爲閽者所獲，執送有司。見集後有一詩云：</p>
<p>文星落處天地泣，</p>
<p>此老已亡吾道窮。</p>
<p>才力漫超生仲逹，</p>
<p>功名猶忌死姚崇。</p>
<p>人間便覺無淸氣，</p>
<p>海內何曾識古風？</p>
<p>平日萬篇誰愛惜？</p>
<p>六丁收拾上瑤宮。</p>
<p>京尹義其人，且畏累已，因陰縱之東坡文字的厄運如何，從這小記裏可以看到。同時，也可以想起，無論你如何的禁，需要的人總是需要。秦始皇是最澈底的，他簡直從能做書的『儒』動手起，『焚書』而且『坑儒』，結果怎様呢？</p>
<p>書是存在着，儒也没有『絕』。有需要的人，自有其獲得與印行的方法·『甚嚴』是没有用的。若是大家不需要，即便是强有力者與以種種的助力，也不能有絲毫的推動。打倒敵人，扶助自己·這個『自己』、要是爲大家所『深惡而痛絕之』時，扶助也無法扶助起。</p>

<p>一輛汽車停頓在西山ＸＸ飯店前門土地上，出來了一個男子，一個碩丰俊美的男子，一個女人，個穿了綠色絲質長袍的女人，兩人看了三樓一間明亮的房間。一會兒，汽車上的行李，一個黃衣箱，一個黑色打字機小箱，從樓下搬來時，女人告給穿制服的僕役，嘰告汽車夫，等一點鐘就要下山。</p>
<p>過了一點鐘後，那輛汽車在八里莊坦平官道上向城中跑去時，却只是一輛空車。</p>
<p>將近黃昏時，男子擁了薄呢大衣，伴同女人立定在旅館屋頂石欄干邊，望一抹　霧流動於山下平田遠村間，天上有類霞如女人臉輔，天空東北方角隅裏，現出一粒星星，一切皆如夢境。旅館前面是上八大處的大道，山道上正有兩個身穿中學生制服的女孩子，同一個穿翻領襯衣黃色短褲的男子，向旅館看門人，詢問上山過某處的道路。一望而知這些年靑人皆是從城中結伴上山來旅行的。</p>
<p>女人看看身旁久病新瘥的男子，輕輕的透了口氣。</p>
<p>去旅館大約半里遠近，有一個小小山阜，阜上種得全是洋槐，那樹林浴在夕陽中，黃色的葉子更覺得耀人眼目。男子似乎對於這小阜發生了興味，就向女人説：</p>
<p>『我們到那邊去看看好不好』？</p>
<p>女人望了一望他的臉兒，便輕輕的説：</p>
<p>『你不是應當休息嗎』？</p>
<p>『我歡喜那個小山』。男的説，一這山似乎是我們的』</p>
<p>『你不能太累』！女的雖那麽説，却側過了身，讓男子先走。『我精神好極了，我們去玩玩，回來好吃飯』。</p>
<p>兩人不久就到了那山阜樹林裏。這里一切恰恰同三年前的海濱地方一様，兩人走進樹林時，皆有所驚訝，不約而同急促的舉步穿過樹林，彷佛樹林盡處，卽是那片變化無方的大海。但到了樹林盡頭處，方明白前面不是大海，却只是一個私人的墳地。女的一見墳地，爲之一怔，站着發了痴。男的却不注意到這墳地，只愉快的笑着，因爲更遠處，夕陽把大地上一切皆鍍了金色，奇景當前，有不可形容的瑰麗。</p>
<p>男子似乎走得太急促了一些，已微微作喘，把手遞給女子後，便問女子這地方像不像一個兩人十分熟習的地方。她聽着這個詢問時，輕微的透了一口氣，勉强笑着，用這微笑掩飾了自己的感情。</p>
<p>『回憶使人年靑了許多』。男的自言自語的説着。</p>
<p>但那女的却自心中回答着：『一個人用回憶來生活，顯見提這人生活也只剩下些殘餘渣滓了，一</p>
<p>晚風輕輕的刷着槐樹，黃色葉子一片一片落在兩人身上與脚邊，男子心中旣極快樂，故意作成感喞似的説：</p>
<p>『夏天過了，春天在夏天的前面，繼着夏天而來的是秋天。多美麗的秋天！』</p>
<p>他説着，同時又把眼睛望着有一秋意的女人的眼·眉·口·鼻。她的確是美麗的，但一望而知這種美麗不是繁花壓枝的三月，却是黃葉藉地的八月。但他現在覺得她特别可愛，覺得那點嫵媚處，却使她超越了時間的限制，變成永遠天眞可愛，永遠動人吸人的好處了。他想起了幾年來兩人間的關係，如何交織了眼淚與微笑。他想起她因愛他而發生的種種事情，他想起自己，幾年來如何被愛，却只是初看來好像故意逃避，其實説來則只漫無理性的拒絕，便带了三分羞慚，把一隻手向女人伸去，兩人握着了手，眼睛對着眼睛時，他抱歉似的輕輕的説：</p>

<p>『爲人生而文學』和『　　術而文　　　是現代文藝思潮上的一個至大的問題。不過我以爲母論是『爲人生』或『爲藝術』底，凡作品須具有生命力。强有力的『生命力』是人類『慾』底活動，而『爭慾』是藝術動的主素，『食慾』和『性慾』是保持釋　生存的主素。雖然人類是具有感情的，但亦决不能不飲食不生殖而專講『美慾』，專事藝術動底發展而『爲藝術而文學』：但也不能如動物等事生殖而無感情上底美的追求而談生活上的餟事底『爲人生而文學』。其實，『爲人生而文學』，『爲藝術而文學』，這些名詞固已勉强，人生本應有藝術衝動的·假若我们不忽略三大慾之一的『美慾』的話。從廣　釋之，『爲人生而文學』沿是可以的名稱，因爲文學是表演人生的，而人生又是多方面的（非專注於美的感情而亦得顧到吃飯交媾的。），故凡文學作品，應有人生各慾底伸張之命力。　　這祇是我底見，而且是本質地底。至於『象牙塔』，『生活鬥爭』等等的思見主張又當别诠論，因爲那些是與社會進化階級變遷有關的。</p>
<p>我是不贊成『象牙塔』中優游者的，但我也豈以贊成空喊口號的『普羅』者！</p>
<p>無產階級很可以有眞正的他們實人生的藝術品展予世界之前，但是現在我們所有看見的祇是那些含着宣傳的意味的不眞實的驅人的口號而已。同様日、右翼作家祇想逃避現實地底底也在自斯斯人！然而這也正是這百般凌亂的現社會的必有現象，祇是個轉形斯的怀开。儼使左翼者走上眞正的軌道，，眞的藝術品也許會產生的。不過，我們且冷淡一點，别上這二種在凌亂中弄把戲的當丨我們不能吟風弄月，我們也不能瞎騙連字也不識的勞働春。所以在没　了解一切之前應抱定用『槪論』底熊度研究和觀察。</p>

<p>社會黑暗的一幕</p>
<p>『三年地保毒如蛇』丨鄕下人的對於地保畏如蛇蝎，已在這句俗語裏盡情地暴露了。這也無非是中國社會制度不良的遺害吧！當地保的没有一血不仗勢凌民，魚肉鄕里。無知無識的可憐的愚民，一任若輩的宰割·却都呑聲飲泣地敢怒而不敢言！抵抗兩字更不必去説了。　　自從靑天白日的旗識，高高地揭上了竿頭社會上一切封建式的名稱，就都壽終正寢的淘汰去了，地保兩字，當然也不能例外，搖身一變而改做一催征吏』。但他們丨地保丨的仗勢凌民，魚肉鄕里，却不因變更名稱的影響而銷聲匿跡啦！地保，催征吏，無非是一套『換湯不換藥』的滑稽的把戲吧。</p>
<p>Ｘ村里的催征吏王ＸＸ，狐假虎威的仗了官廳的勢力，來斯凌村里的愚民，威嚇利誘，唆訟興獄，弄得Ｘ村里的民衆焦頭爛額，怨聲載道！當時幾恛稍有智識的人，感覺到受王催征吏的蹂躪的痛苦，再透頂也没有了，他摧殘脅迫的手段，也無上的慘酷了，怎能再呑聲忍氣的含寃下去啊。於是京聯合了二十多個村民，寫了一張王催征吏違法殃民Ｘ大罪狀的狀子，到官廳去控告。但狀子進了衙門，他們丨村民丨的心中又都忐忑的不巡起來，各人的面部，也十足地顯露了恐懼的情緖。原來王催征吏靠山硬，神通大，小百姓去告他，以卵擊石！不要『畫虎不成反類犬』，演成了『撥草驚蛇』的結果，那豈非自召其禍咧！大家回味一想，都感覺着惴惴恐懼，懊悔把禀子去告王催征更。</p>
<p>王催征吏發學了他本材的民衆在告</p>
<p>他，馬上跑去告訴他的唯一靠山的Ｘ紳士老爺。</p>
<p>Ｘ紳士對他説；你也不用驚惶，看吹啥風　啥　是了』。在Ｘ紳士的老練的口吻裏，王催征吏的胆，陡然一壯！一顆『做賊人心虚』的心，也就得了無上的安慰了。</p>
<p>這大槪是Ｘ紳士放的神通的効力吧，官廳接了民衆的狀子，没有出傳票來傳集被告去侒律審理只隨隨便便地把原狀發交了一個久在縣府候差的縣長親　李ＸＸ密查具覆。李ＸＸ接到了調查公事，心下明白這是縣長攸念他候差多時吃　當光，經濟恐慌極了，所以特地給一椿有『　頭』的事怀他幹。</p>
<p>李委員到了Ｘ村，第一張拜客的名就飛到Ｘ紳士的府上。</p>
<p>據説今夜Ｘ紳士府上請客，請的是縣政府委員李ＸＸ當李委員吃得酩酊大站起來向Ｘ紳士告辭前的十分鐵的時候，Ｘ紳士會客室裏的空氮，突然緊張！頭上掛的汽燈，也頓時起了變化，潔白耀目的光明，突然幻變了鳥黑的黯淡的迷離的光芒。這時這室里的大菜台上，彷彿擺列着兩件神必的東西，一様好像是銀行支票，又像怎麽衙門公文；還有一疊東西像吃了病好的藥方，又像人人歡喜的鈔票。旁側有兩個人在交頭接耳竊私議，面目模糊·三分像Ｘ紳士和李委員呢！</p>
<p>Ｘ天之後Ｘ縣民衆報上登着一段新聞，（Ｘ村公民ＸＸＸ等聯名控訴Ｘ圖催征吏王ＸＸ違法殃民，經縣諲委派李ＸＸ下鄕秘密調查後，據覆『所控各節查無實據』，因之縣府已將該公民等控訴撤銷矣云云）。</p>
<h3 id="c278">談孝 <a href="#c278" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e278" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">278</a></h3>
<p>— 列火</p>
<p>早幾日談了一塲『禮』，這來談『孝』，倒並不是我惡心來尋國人算賬，只因不慣舊禮敎正在崩潰，新的尙無從建設的現過渡期中、『孝』的烏烟　氣，也同様的使人看不慣眼，同様有淸算的必要。</p>
<p>不消説，『孝』又是一種色香濃郁的國粹，自曾晳以降·幾千年代，牠在一般人的腦子裏，是鐫刻着深刻的印象，而成其爲『修身』之第一着。惟其如此，也就最有力量的影響着人類的生活。逮乎近茲、老派的人，固還在膜拜不　，頂禮是奉：就是裏在領結西服中的渾身洋氣的新式人物，又何嘗不以『衛生』自期？只不過在潦倒窮困的當兒，類皆喜愛説説風凉，甚至走上『鄙棄』一途。然一旦否去泰來，氣運享通，受着麥克麥克的指揮，也就會『孝行不匱』（？）起來。這，在外觀上往往來提更裝做，內心也就最虚僞。</p>
<p>且看現在一般人所奉行的『孝』，是怎様的孝法？</p>
<p>當父母在時，最普通的一種『孝』，日口體之奉，就是説在物質的享受上要侍奉得十分周到。比如生息在温带的上海，冬季没有鮮味的蔬菜，你就不妨乘船趁車到熱带去提販些回來，（托人便带亦可）好生燒烤，供上嚴父慈母的食台，禮恭至敬的勸進，這就是『孝』，這就會『聲譽所播，遐邇同欽。』</p>
<p>其次是嚴父慈母的言行，　醜至偷竊售淫，或如現下所風行的充漢奸，賣祖國，也唯父母之命是從·不加誹議，一様的孝敬，這也可以博得社會人士的一聲『孝子』。</p>
<p>自然囉，這些還是『孝』之小焉者。最要的是孝到如三字經上的『揚名聲，顯父母』，要『揚』而『顯』，就非丢棄『耕　』『經商』的下　進而作個』惟有</p>

<p>若是萬一『瑤池促』召，父母竟溘然長逝而登仙了，那就需要廣發『訃聞』，</p>
<p>『行述』，而且必要請名流題贊，而且要全都題些『嘉美之詞』，而且要自己是『罪孼深重』，行述的時候，又要『語無倫次』，女晚輩呢，當治喪時，禮生喝聲『舉哀』，便需要『放聲痛哭』，如奏哀樂然，一陣一陣的，這才算是『祭之以禮』。然後便需『在了三年』，主着都有定制，不能行婚嫁等喜　之事。這様，長眠地下者，亦嘉許其于孫之孝矣。</p>
<p>我們看，這些，這些，是何等的假裝，虚僞，何等的不與生活相關擊，何飄揚着，頭見得益加活潑有生氣。我緩緩地一，步，走向前去，漸漸的才覺得那古城四周的雲霧裏，隱藏着許多　　的山峯，不時有鋭厲的咆哮聲，從那些山峯中發出來，不周而知是異於尋常的猛獸了。我又前進，瞧見那蒼老的城磚，一塊塊斑　地堆砌着，似乎表示它在這虎狼窟裏已支持有四五千年悠遠歷史了；我對這偉大的古國，心中自然生敬；雖然那洞開着而没有一個守城的軍人令人有些驚異，但是却並没有减失我一分敬仰之心。</p>
<p>城中是非常的冷靜，冷靜得竟出於我的意炒之外。長過頭頂的荒草，蔓延了大地，牆脚下的靑苔，在訴説牠的寂　；我悄悄地一個人分着荊草，低聲吟着歌前行；『這難道是巴比倫第二么？不然爲河如此的凄凉荒！』</p>
<p>好一會，才走到有人烟的地方。然而那些人民也奇怪，無論在做事談話行路都是十分的蕭索；我看來看去覺得没</p>
<p>等的玷污『孝』的本質！只要看遺產的爭執，常於父母新喪，即大鬧於公庭，就可推及其。他</p>
<p>但我們並不反對『孝』，不過我們對『孝』的認識有些兩様，眞正的『孝』與『孝子』應該如此；</p>
<p>（一）在年少時·應承宻父母的善的敎養，學取父母的善的生活，不要嬉遊浪蕩，以爲父母憂。</p>
<p>（二）成年以後，應自謀生計及經濟的獨立，不要倚靠父母的養老家產，而在社會上做一個倫生苟活者。</p>
<p>應努力事業，爲社會服務，爲大衆謀福，以盡人生　義及報答父母的劬勞，不要作惡社會，稱禍人類大衆。</p>

<p>— 厚英</p>
<p>恍惚之中，忽然在我的眼前况出一座古城，闊而迤長的城牆，雄莊峻險之中還　着些華貴，雖然很遙遠，但是已覺得高大如一座小山了。三色的國旗　映着都陽鮮艶的光彩，在上面臨風有一個人有絲毫的生氣，麻　了的神情竟似一個活屍。他們的身體，其弱如蠟；仇們的眼光，其小如豆；他們的意志，其　如紙；他們的心血，其冷如水；他們的精神，其枯如槁；唉！世界上却有一個正在做着夢未醒的民族！</p>
<p>迎面忽來了一隊兵士，他們黃色的軍服給日光耀着就如一團火，這團火啊，灼得那些疲弱的人民都向兩旁退避了。我疑心他們是另一民族，果然，他們鋭厲的聲音我認出就是城外巉峯上的猛獸，可憐這一古國中醉生夢死的衆生，將不免都被這羣猛獸一個個活活地吞下去了！他們肩着插上剌刀的槍，傲然地跨着整齊的步伐，雪亮的剌刀上尙凝滞了絲絲紅的鮮血，　　的腹聲下我聽見這個古國的民族的呻吟。他們猶如一輪炎炎的烈日，令人不敢正眼逼視；他們以槍尖來驅使這古國中的人忆如人之驅　牛馬，他們簡直是這一國中的　　。　　街　　掛了數十具枯　的屍體，他　　下面正圍聚了許多位同胞在那裏手舞足蹈的嘖嘖　賞！這個民族的良心竟喪亡到如此地步，我代爲他們悲痛，恥唇！</p>
<p>再走過支，一道大河橫臨在我的面前了。河的兩旁，叢生着許多　荻，秋風吹來，索索地都隨風而倒。河水是異常的渾濁而且呆滞，正同這個民族一様無生氣，近前去一看，却原來是多量的烟灰把牠堵住了。</p>
<p>我心中茫茫然似乎有什麽感觸，信足而走也不知已行了多少路程。猛然間一片喊殺的戰聲被和風傳到我的耳朶裏，我抬起頭來細觀不料是同一個民族在那裏狠地自相殘殺；再看那巉峯上的猛獸們却正在張開了哈哈大笑！我嘆了一口氣，回轉身便走出了那扇洞開着無人看顧的城門。夕陽的餘輝正從那樹杪間射過來，照見那斑　的城牆也好似在那裏嘆息埀淚！這時候。</p>

<p>— 士本</p>
<p>不久以前，本報的『春秋』欄裏，登有Ｘ君的一篇『葉底語』，雋永絕倫，妙語解頣。查『葉底語』，俗名呌做『縮脚韻』，在浦東各地，中下級社會，都能此道，他們在工作或休息的時候，輒喜用『縮脚韻』來打趣，比如榻便宜『你要呌我一聲（城隍老）哩丨』『你是我的（香烟牌）啊丨』等等。往往不加思索，脱口成趣。前天晚上納凉，我和隔鄰的Ｘ裁縫説起『縮脚韻』，他就説了一個關於『縮脚韻』的故事，因爲頗堪發噱，所以錄投本刋，博讀者諸君一笑。</p>
<p>他説『昔年有一某甲，性頗滑稽，且諳葉底語』，一日和同伴偶在廟中游玩。適見一美貌少婦，盛裝艶服，乘與來廟燒香，趨前細視之，見少婦雖容姿艶麗，而榴裙下的一對金蓮，竟和魯男子一様的碩大　朋！眞是美中不足了。因向伴説道一只『牛頭馬』（面），雖然『煞死討』（好）、但那雙『敲釘轉』（脚），這様『挺腰疊』（諧大），眞是半截觀音哩！少婦聽了、心下明白在説她的破話，書下也不聲響，燒香已畢，上轎而去。那知這少婦是本縣縣老爺的愛姫，，回去把某甲戲辱話，哭訴其夫，縣老爺一聽大怒丨以某甲有意侮辱官眷，即忙傳命通班差役，逕往廟中，把某甲逮至，老爺親自審問，對某甲説道；你旣善巧舌，鼓弄雌簧，本縣姑且不來罪你，限你説五個『縮脚韻』的『眞字』，説得對放你，不對再行重究。某甲聽了以爲這有何難，即忙答道；『萬病一』（諧眞），『一片天』（眞），『胡大天』（諧眞），『元始天』（諧眞），那知還有一個，竟百罳不得。於是老爺命打入獄中，待他説滿了五字，再行釋放，某甲在獄中啼啼哭哭，朝思暮想，　難想出，　來他的妻子來探監，夫妻相見，抱頭大哭！甲訴説怎様起因，怎様被捕，怎様不能出獄，其妻一聽，係因戲謔　發生的禍事，眞是假事弄成眞事了，因之隨口説道；『怎麽倒是弄假成眞了』。豈知這句話某甲聽了，驚喜欲狂，大呼『好個（弄假成）』多時想不出的一個眞字　　現在無煮中得來全不費功夫，於是馬上禀報縣老爺，開釋而去。』</p>

<p>故鄉散記之一</p>
<p>許久時候没有見故鄕了，從火車站坐上洋車，我好像依在母親的懐裏，任那車身　簸地前進，做着小時候的美　的夢。雖然有許多新式的建築物，及更變了的街道，不復是我離别時的那般古樸，但我能重見故鄕，悲歡的情緖我一時實描寫不來。</p>
<p>車將抵家門，已是暮色蒼茫。門前的，牠舞動着枝葉茂盛的爪牙，更顯得一排老屋的凋零。麥塲上也不再從前的光景。一個三五歲的孩子在樹根邊玩弄些什麽，被矮屋門前的老婦人怒　着。我車子行近時，纔認淸那老婦人-是阿牛的母親。她也像知道我回來似的説：『少爺眞回來了！』説着她喊那孩子，『快些呌你爸來！』</p>
<p>我吩咐洋車停了。想問她這孩子是誰，那孩子已牽着职牛的手從隔壁屋裏出來。</p>
<p>『少爺回來了。小牛，這是房東少爺啊。』他牽牽孩子的手·孩子却一溜烟的到樹根那邊了。</p>
<p>阿牛是我們小時候的朋友。摸　，捕蟬，我們常常爲了一點小事爭執起來；至於吃虧了哭着臉喊他媽的時候也有。現在我離别了故鄕幾年，他也負起鋤頭種他的田。你看一張赤黑的臉，上身赤着膞，露出他被勞動練成的筋肉·褲管　到大腿上，與我這丰衫同志比較起來，而且他還租了我們的小屋，他似乎感覺到我們身份的懸殊，但是我對於他的卑躬的模様也好像十分難受。搭訕着説：『那是你的兒子？』</p>
<p>『少爺是的。見不得！』他面上似乎强作笑容，掩飾他説話的不自然。</p>
<p>『爹，一個蟬。』孩子在樹根邊捉到那個動物，快活的給他爹看。</p>
<p>『進去睡，天天捉蟬。』阿牛駡了孩子，笑着説：『少爺，還没有吃飯吧？停會我過來。』</p>
<p>『停會過來談談。』我别過了他們父子三個，逕自到自己家裏。</p>
<p>當晚家中發生了爭執，我雖然做了二小時的唖吧傀儡，但爲了一點遺產問題，家庭之中常鬧着把戲，我是十二分的不樂意。想當夜回上海，可是我的傀儡工作没有完畢之前，脱不得身的。（這件事詳在故鄕散記之二）</p>
<p>睡在古廟般的破屋裏，半夜没有好睡。聽那風聲吹過屋頂，聽那老鼠在屋角吱吱的呌。終於阿牛那赤黑的臉浮到我的面前來，他已被年齡带走了天眞，他知道呌『少爺。』摸蚱，捕蟬·已是他兒子的時代了。如其講起爲了一個蚱殼他哭着告訴媽的故事，阿牛不知哭好呢，笑好？我們還是不滿三十歲的人，而同時代的伴侶，已裂起這般深的鴻溝，所　　以幾十年後的遺產，會引起子孫的爭執了。</p>
<p>睡熟時在黎明之前，但是阿牛赤黑的脸在我夢魂中没有消近逝過。</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Leading figures from the Chinese Society and the Lushan Conference have engaged in discussions on practical matters, aiming to streamline organizations and increase work efficiency. It is rumored that the central government intends to place the Navy, Army, and Training Departments under the unified jurisdiction of the Military Affairs Commission. The National Economic Council's organization would control national finances, while the Ministry of Finance would have its scope reduced, or even be abolished. Party affairs will be trained from the lowest-level organizations. The cotton and wheat loans will be fully utilized for reconstruction work, with a portion used for bandit suppression in Jiangxi Province, addressing both immediate and fundamental issues, and will not be diverted for other purposes. It is said that the government's organization will also change accordingly after the conference. While the government has not denied this, it may be just a suggestion, and practical implementation may face difficulties, as it concerns changes to the government's organization and cannot take effect without the approval of the entire conference. This statement should not be considered final. (7th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Zhao Pilian told people that Feng Yuxiang's future role could be decided at this Lushan Conference. He would either be an Army Inspector or the National Water Conservancy Director. Once Feng agrees, the announcement could be made. (7th Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Beiping) Zhangbei Dispatch: Yesterday, Song went to Duoshun to inspect the troops formerly under Sun Liangcheng, including those of Gao Shuxun, Lei Zhongtian, and Wan Min. The troops in Duoshun are temporarily entrusted to Lei Zhongtian. Gao Shuxun's troops are transferred to Zhangbei for thorough reorganization. Ji led his remnant troops in an attempt to flee to Dushikou, but was refused by Liu Guitang and is now lingering at the junction of Guyuan and Baochang, trapped in a dilemma. Song has dispatched Division Commander Zhao Dengyu to lead a large army to close in, and a concrete solution is expected soon. Song telegraphed Fang, making a final admonition, advising him to leave the military immediately and return to the central government, but has not yet received a reply. (7th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Song Zheyuan telegraphed Fang on the 6th, saying, "My brother Bai, since returning to Chahar, you have repeatedly offered loyal advice, but it has not been adopted. Now, I make a final admonition, hoping you will consider it carefully. The nation is in imminent danger, and the situation is urgent. The entire country hopes for unity. My brother is an advanced member of the party and the nation, with a long-standing reputation. You should sacrifice your personal views and jointly resist foreign aggression. If you can immediately relinquish military power and assist the central government, the future of the nation will greatly benefit. This is from the perspective of the overall situation. In terms of personal feelings, my brother and I have shared hardships for a long time, not just for a day or two. Given your environment, you are situated in a remote corner, without financial resources, lacking food and clothing. I fear that a crisis is imminent, and you will burn yourself if you do not restrain yourself. My heart feels the danger, and I cannot but tell you. Brother Guitang's troops have shown loyalty in accepting the reorganization and will not be affected by your influence, causing suspicion. My brother advocates resistance against Japan to save the nation, and you must not be suspected of being a puppet, lest you incur criticism from the people of the country, starting with love for the country and ending with harming the country. This should not be done by my brother. Therefore, for the sake of the nation and for your personal sake, you should resolutely hand over your troops to the government. I hope you will carefully consider this and make a decision soon. I have spoken my mind for both public and private reasons. I hope you will understand and reply favorably." (7th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Zhangbei Dispatch: Song returned to Zhangbei from Duoshun last night.</p>
<p>The garrison in Duoshun has been inspected. Those with a rifle and a horse are reorganized, while those without are dismissed. All military and political post-affairs are handed over to Lei Zhongtian for handling. Because Liu Guitang is blocking him in Dushikou, Ji cannot join Fang and has already led his troops to flee towards Baochang. Song has urgently dispatched Zhang Lingyun and Ye Yuling in two directions to pursue and suppress them, and it is expected that the situation will be resolved soon. (7th Dispatch)</p>

He urgently requests consideration of the severity of the disaster and immediate allocation of the approved 500,000 yuan. Post-disaster measures, such as establishing large-scale shelters, purchasing oxen, and distributing cotton clothing, all require large sums of money. Shandong province is having a bumper harvest in areas not affected by the floods, and food is not lacking and can be purchased. If the central government can issue a large sum of money, the difficulties can be resolved immediately. He specifically telegraphed to explain, hoping for strong support. (7th Dispatch) (Nanjing) Han Fuju telegraphed the Yellow River Conservancy Commission, saying that the disaster situation in Shandong province is very severe. Although the province is trying its best to raise funds and distribute urgent relief, it is like a drop in the bucket and cannot solve the problem. He requests consideration of the severity of the disaster and immediate allocation of the approved 500,000 yuan. As for post-disaster measures, such as establishing large-scale shelters, purchasing oxen, and distributing cotton clothing, all require large sums of money. If funds are available, they can be purchased. If the central government can issue a large sum of money, the difficulties can be resolved immediately. He requests strong support. (7th Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Xiamen) Cai Tingkai flew from Zhang to the province on the 7th to command military affairs upstream. His staff and secretaries traveled by the Xiamen-Hai ferry. Mao Weishou commanded six regiments of Yong'an troops to attack the main force of the communist bandits in Youxi. Fierce battles have been ongoing since the 6th, with heavy casualties for the bandits.

Yanping received reinforcements from Situ Fei's brigade, and the bandits lifted the siege and retreated 30 li. Communication between the province and Yanping has been restored. Also, on the 7th, the Zhang headquarters sealed over 80 trucks on four routes in Zhangzhou to transport troops through Quanzhou to the province. Another supplementary regiment of over 1,500 soldiers departed from Xiamen to Fuzhou.

<p>(Nanjing) According to foreign news, the Jiangxi communists recently engaged in fierce battles with the Fujian bandit suppression army. The government troops suffered slight losses, so Yanping was once in a state of emergency, but the situation has now eased. A large group of bandits has been discovered in the Shuikou area, apparently intending to cut off the connection between Yanping and Fuzhou. Cai Tingkai has now dispatched six elite regiments to encircle and intercept them. It is expected that the situation will not escalate. Chen Jiliang, commander of the First Fleet of the Navy, has led six warships to Mawei, stabilizing the public's morale. There are no reports of foreigners leaving the country. The U.S. China Fleet has not yet dispatched additional warships to protect foreigners, indicating that the situation is not serious. (7th Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Tianjin) The rampant banditry in the Luan East area has a significant impact on the security of North China. The Chinese representative, Liu Shisun, notified the Japanese garrison yesterday that China intends to send troops to suppress them, requesting understanding. However, the Japanese army believes that the entry of Chinese troops into the area violates the truce agreement and requires seeking the opinion of the Kwantung Army, so this issue is still under study. There are now four possible methods for suppressing the bandits in Luan East: (1) Bandit suppression by a large security force; (2) Joint suppression by Chinese and Japanese troops; (3) Suppression by Chinese troops; (4) Suppression by Japanese troops.

Our country is limited by its strength and unable to engage in active struggle, and the United States and other countries are also suffering from domestic economic panic and dare not provoke easily. Japan sees the weakness of Britain and the United States and knows that they are far across the ocean and cannot do anything despite their heavy troops. Therefore, its ambition is becoming more and more rampant. It relies on its geographical convenience and military control of the current situation. On the one hand, it maintains its existing gains, and on the other hand, it strives to defend itself. Against the United States, it controls the Ogasawara Islands, south to the Caroline and Marshall Islands. It can advance to take the Philippines, seize Guam, and spy on Hawaii, or retreat to maintain the economic connection between Japan and the three northeastern provinces. Against Britain, it uses Taiwan and the Penghu Islands to break through the naval mines laid by Britain in the Far East in Hong Kong, making it difficult for Singapore, the gate to the Indian Ocean, to maintain itself. Moreover, Japan is actively wooing and cultivating latent forces in the local communities of indigenous peoples in Malaysia and India. It is also making every effort to dump industrial manufactured products, causing British products to feel economic threats. This is a more obvious fact. Furthermore, observing the huge military expenditures of Japan in the last three years is even more astonishing. In terms of the percentage of its total treasury expenditure, it is undoubtedly a quasi-wartime budget. The total naval expenditure for the next fiscal year is 680 million yen, and the new request is for 430 million yen. The four-year shipbuilding plan, until the expiration of the London Treaty in 1936, totals 190 million yen. The shipbuilding fee for the next fiscal year alone is 180 million yen. Its purpose is self-evident. The United States is not willing to give up the Eastern market and allow the naval power of its hypothetical enemy to become dominant. Therefore, it also has a plan for 32 new warships, initially planning to spend 238 million US dollars in the next three years, with an average annual expenditure of more than 70 million US dollars, to compete for military equipment. Later, seeing Japan expanding its military equipment more vigorously and adding an industrial recovery plan, it also had to develop its industry with the revitalization of the military industry. Therefore, the cost of building new ships also increased to 110 million US dollars, and the cost of building aircraft and land and water facilities reached 10 million US dollars, almost doubling the original plan. Its intention can also be seen. Recently, the newspaper published the naval authorities' comments on the US fleet staying in the Pacific, saying that the Far East issue has been resolved, but the US fleet is still ordered to stay in the Pacific because the US president is too concerned about the Far East issue. Japan cannot but pay more attention to it. In fact, the reason why the United States is concerned about the Far East is precisely because Japan is too concerned. The competition between the two sides is evident on paper.</p>
<p>Britain originally considered maintaining the status quo as the best strategy. However, the United States has risen on the other side of the Atlantic, and the countries of South America are completely dominated by US dollars. Even Canada is more economically influenced by the United States. If the British Empire has no appropriate self-rescue method, it may inevitably become the continuation of Spain in the past. Therefore, after the Ottawa British Empire Economic Conference, the British Empire Economic Alliance was established, and it could not but abandon the traditional free trade policy and turn to the banner of extreme protectionism and closed-door policy. On the one hand, seeing that today's world economic competition is implicitly supported by huge land, sea, and air forces for its foreign trade development, and that Japan and the United States have already fully enriched their military equipment, how can Britain lag behind? In order to maintain its maritime trade status and maintain its colonial markets scattered around the world, active expansion of the navy is also inevitable.</p>

<h3 id="e27">Wang and Chiang's Telegraph Reply to Chen and Cai with Sincere Answers to the Four Matters Discussed <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>(Nanyang) Chen Jitang, Li Zongren, Cai Tingkai, and others sent a telegram to President Wang of the Executive Yuan and Chairman Chiang on the [day] before (the 3rd) to discuss four matters. Wang and Chiang sent a reply by telegram on the 6th, providing sincere answers to all points discussed. The original text of the two telegrams is recorded below:</p>
<p>Telegram from Chen, etc., to President Wang of the Executive Yuan of the Nanjing Central Party Headquarters and Chairman Chiang at Kuling, [unclear] secret. The national crisis is severe, reaching its extreme. The Central government's measures have been repeatedly questioned in telegrams from the Southwest Executive Department and the Southwest Political Affairs Committee, but no practical response has been received. Jitang and others dedicate themselves to the Party and the country, witnessing the difficulties of the time, and with the righteousness of every citizen being responsible, they respectfully discuss several matters: (1) Stop convening the Fifth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang. The way to save the nation lies in suppressing the Communists and resisting foreign aggression. The plan for suppressing the Communists and resisting foreign aggression was already decided at the Fourth Plenary Session, but it has not been effectively implemented. Now, in the midst of intense Communist suppression work, convening the Fifth Plenary Session is deeply feared to cause disputes as soon as the meeting opens, reducing revolutionary strength and hindering the work of suppressing bandits and resisting foreign aggression, not stopping until the Party and the country are plunged into an irrecoverable abyss. It is requested that the convocation be stopped immediately to avert the crisis. If, in the future, after examining the situation, there is truly a need to convene it, then it will be reconvened. (2) Publicly determine the use of borrowed funds. Raising foreign debts is truly a last resort. Borrowing debts and not using them for productive purposes is even more a recipe for destruction. [Unclear] thinking of the past events is enough to make one's heart cold. The rural economy is fundamental to the country. China's rural areas are already on the verge of bankruptcy. Now, due to the cotton and wheat loan, a large amount of foreign agricultural products are imported. The already collapsing rural areas are subjected to this irresistible pressure. The dying peasants will inevitably end up in ditches. If this cotton and wheat loan is used for purposes other than production, it is no different from depriving farmers of food and clothing, causing them to starve and freeze to death. Jitang and others, in their ignorance, believe that the cotton and wheat loan must be used for productive purposes in any case, and request approval for representatives to be dispatched from military and civilian officials and mass organizations in various provinces to form a committee to jointly manage and supervise the use of the funds, in order to show transparency. (3) Announce the full text of the Tanggu Truce Agreement. The Tanggu Truce Agreement is opposed by the whole country, and there are rumors outside of a military agreement, subject to foreigners [unclear] the principle of Sino-Japanese compromise. This matter concerns the safety of the Party and the country, and the survival of the nation. Whether it exists or not should not be concealed and unannounced. It is requested that the full text be announced as soon as possible to dispel public doubts. (4) Support the anti-Japanese troops in Chahar Province. Feng and Fang rose up to resist Japan. Regardless of their strength, their spirit of unyielding perseverance and continuous efforts to fight for the survival of the country and avenge the humiliation of the nation is enough to move heaven and earth and make ghosts and gods weep. It is requested that the central troops stop advancing to oppress them, preserve the anti-Japanese troops, avoid making them displaced, and dashing the spirit of national unity against the enemy. What is stated above, although from the mouths of Jitang and others, is actually the public opinion of the people of the whole country. If the Central government adopts it, it can regain the hearts of the people that have been lost and turn hostility into harmony. Otherwise, the future of the Party and the country is unbearable to ask about. A pressing telegram is presented, with extreme trepidation awaiting orders. Chen Jitang, Li Zongren, Cai Tingkai respectfully kowtow.</p>
<p>Telegram from Wang and Chiang: Your telegram has been read. The brothers' concern for the current situation and presentation of four matters are earnest and detailed, which is deeply admired. Regarding the first item, the issue of stopping the convocation of the Fifth Plenary Session, according to the Party Constitution, the Fifth Plenary Session must be convened in November this year. However, the Party Constitution also stipulates that if there are unavoidable reasons, the convocation can be postponed for one year. Therefore, regarding the proposal of the first item, the two brothers Ben and Lin can propose it to the Central Standing Committee with their qualifications as Central Committee members, in accordance with the procedures. We have no preconceived notions about this. We will send another communication after the results of the Central Committee meeting are decided. As for the second, third, and fourth items, we can responsibly reply as follows: (1) The use of cotton and wheat loans has long been decided by the Central Political Conference to be used for productive purposes, especially focusing on agricultural production. We stated this intention in a circular telegram on July 28, and solemnly declared that it will never be diverted to military expenses. As for the detailed regulations on the use of funds and the methods of management and supervision, the Standing Committee of the Central Political Conference is currently jointly participating in drafting them, and it will be decided and announced in the near future. It coincides with the proposal in your telegram, and everything will surely be made public. (2) The full text of the Tanggu Truce Agreement has long been fully announced. There are absolutely no secret and unannounced attachments. Do not lightly believe rumors and create doubts. When the Shanghai truce was concluded last year, there were also such rumors, which soon disappeared. Rumors have absolutely no lasting power. (3) The troops in Chahar Province have been repeatedly discussed sincerely with Minister He, Chairman Song, etc. Recently, arrangements have been made. According to a telegram report from the East (1st), those who have been reorganized are: Deng Wenjiu's old troops, who have newly and arbitrarily become the commander of the temporarily organized 10th Cavalry Division; Li Zhongyi, the commander of the temporarily organized 24th Cavalry Brigade; Zhang Renjie, the commander of the 3rd Temporary Division; Liu Guitang, the commander of the Chahar East Guerrilla Forces; Huang Shouchong, the commander of the 1st Guerrilla Detachment; Ruan Xuanwu, the garrison commander of Shangdu; Yao Jingchuan, the garrison commander of Baochang; and Zhang Yunrong, the garrison commander of Zhangbei. The subordinates of Lei Zhongtian, Gao Shuxun, Liu Qingtong, Zhang Lingyun, [unclear], Tang Jukwu, and Liu Zhendong, etc., all of the above generals, are still able to understand the difficulties of the time and jointly maintain the border situation, and have all reported their assumption of office. However, about a thousand people from Ji Hongchang have been turned red. They first went to Shangdu and are now fleeing east to Dushikou, attempting to join forces with Wang Zhongfu and others, remnants of Fang Zhenwu, numbering several hundred. They have not completely submitted. If Zhang Mutao, Xuan Xiabu, etc., [unclear] our communist bandits, can be completely removed, a lenient disposition will still be decided upon. In short, the troops in Chahar Province have been largely reorganized with the intention of treating everyone equally. [Unclear] specially replied. Wang Zhaoming, Jiang Zhongzheng, [unclear] printed (Central Telegram, 7th)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Peng Xuepei said to people: (1) The scope of discussion at this Lushan meeting is no more than financial, diplomatic, and internal affairs issues. As for the content of the meeting, no detailed telegram has been received. We will know when Wang returns to Nanjing in three to five days. (2) Tibetan bandits in Zhongdian County, Yunnan Province. The National Government has received a telegram from Long Yun of that province confirming it and requesting instructions on how to deal with it. The defense in northern Yunnan is weak, and the future is extremely worrying. (3) The charter of the Yellow River Flood Relief Association has not yet been fully reviewed. It can be submitted for approval when Wang returns to Nanjing for a temporary meeting. (Special Telegram, 7th)</p>

<p>(Beiping) At the regular meeting of the Peiping Military Sub-Council yesterday morning, the members all believed that the financial difficulties in North China made it difficult to maintain without vigorously cutting expenses.

<h3 id="e31">Opening Up Communications Between Suiyuan and Xinjiang <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>The Purpose is to Develop the Northwest and Has Nothing to Do with Military Affairs</p>
<p>(Beiping) Previously, there were reports that China and Russia would organize a commercial group in North China. Yesterday, there were more reports about opening up communications between Suiyuan and Xinjiang. This plan is greatly related to our country's development of the Northwest. The plan is to connect the Gao Suo Railway with the Ping Sui Railway to Guihua City. From Guihua City, the route will be surveyed along the original route from Suiyuan to Xinjiang through Tibet. It is rumored that the investigation of Zuo Zongtang's original road from Jiayuguan to Xinjiang is related to this plan. However, Zuo Tang left Jiayuguan, passed through Hami, and went to Dihua via the western route. This time, starting from Guihua City, the route will pass through [unclear] and the Gobi Desert to Uliastai via the eastern route. The route investigation is roughly starting from the eastern route, going out of Kobdo, turning south through Zhenxi to Dihua. The return route will be from the western route back to Lanzhou, so as to investigate both the eastern and western routes. [Unclear] is old [unclear]. Although there are deserts in the middle of these two routes, it is easy to build railways or automobile roads from Gansu and Suiyuan to Xinjiang. A certain party in our country has already started designing and has hired many foreign technical advisors. The advisors include the Swedish explorer Sven Hedin, the German technician Zhou Dibo, and the Chinese Chen, etc. The preparatory office is located in Ping, and the capital is about a joint collection of Chinese and foreign funds. The amount has not been determined. The purpose is to develop transportation in the Northwest and Sino-Russian commerce, and it has nothing to do with military affairs. It has now begun, and if it succeeds in the future, it is expected that the traffic between China and Europe can be reduced by five or six days. (Special Telegram, 7th)</p>

<p>=His Troops Decide to Depart for Qinghai Immediately=</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Peiping office of Sun Dianying's troops received a telegram from Baotou yesterday stating that Sun arrived in Baotou by special train from Guisui yesterday afternoon. After getting off the train, he paid respects to the soldiers of his army who died resisting Japan in Rehe. Sun said that his troops would leave for Qinghai within three to five days to reclaim land, regardless of whether the central government's disbursement funds had arrived. However, the shoes and supplies of his troops were lacking, so he had to do his best. He could only march as many days as possible. It was reported yesterday [unclear] that a brigade each of cavalry and infantry from a certain unit had entered Ningxia territory, seemingly intending to prevent our unit from advancing westward. However, our [unclear] departure for Qinghai will not be stopped because of this, nor will we cause conflict with any party, lest we become a laughingstock internationally.

<p>(Xi'an) Shao Lizi, Zhang Ji, and others went to Wugong on the morning of the 6th and arrived at 1 p.m. Shao intended to inspect the site of the Agricultural College, because the school had newly surveyed the Weijiagang ten miles southwest of Wugong. There was no car access there, and it would take time to go back and forth. Also, because Hu Zongnan had arrived in the province, he urgently wanted to meet him. Therefore, he did not inspect that [unclear]. He and Zhang Ji paid respects at the three ancestral halls of Houji, Jiang Yuan, and Emperor Taizong, and received the petition representatives of the disaster-stricken counties in the county government. For the disaster victims begging for relief, he specially donated 200 yuan for the relief association to distribute.

<p>Preparing for Any Eventuality in the Cuban Situation</p>
<p>Roosevelt Unwilling to Resort to Armed Intervention Hastily Consults with Latin American Ambassadors The Havana Cuban Sergeant Batista seized the opportunity of the nation's attention to post-typhoon relief and quickly consolidated his revolution to overthrow the Cespedes government. Various public affairs are now managed by army sergeants. It is heard that all places are now quiet. The arrival of the American warship in the harbor has stabilized people's hearts. The public now believes that the revolutionary party will prove its ability to cope with the situation. The most urgent thing now is to seek recognition from the American government, but it is not yet possible to talk about this. (Reuters Telegram, 6th)</p>
<p>(Washington) According to a report from American Ambassador Wells, although the Cuban government is currently able to maintain itself, it is somewhat doubtful whether it can obtain the support of various revolutionary factions. According to reports, the new Cuban government is actually organized by two professors, a lawyer, a journalist, and a person who used to work in banking. These people are trying to formulate a temporary administrative system to await the convocation of the constitutional conference. Lieutenant de la Torre is the spokesperson for the Revolutionary Committee and serves as a liaison between the committee and the American embassy. The command of the military is held by Sergeant Batista, who seems to be able to maintain discipline. (National Telegram, 6th)</p>
<p>The plan set by the Havana Revolutionary Committee includes the following points: (1) Economic recovery; (2) Immediate trial of the followers of former President Machado; (3) Recognition of debts borrowed by the republic and agreements made; establishment of good courts; (5) Reorganization of various departments. (Havas Telegram, 6th)</p>
<p>Although the temporary government composed of Havana students has issued declarations and orders from time to time, the impression on all sides is that Havana feels too deserted. The authorities still have no intention of forming a more permanent government today, so no cabinet-like structure has been produced. In addition to the navy and army, all parties believe that American intervention is imminent. However, there is no disturbance here, nor is there any sign of attempting to organize a communist or socialist government. There is very little news from the provinces. Rumors of rioters occupying sugar factories in Santa Clara Province and disturbances in the streets of Camagüey and Santiago have not been confirmed as of tonight. It is not very clear how the new government will deal with finances. Although the navy and army salaries are not lacking at present, the salaries of officials may soon become a problem.

<p>Although there are no reports of disturbances in Havana at present, President Roosevelt, for the sake of thorough preparation, has specifically included the battleship Mississippi in the warships to be sent to Havana and has transferred a detachment of 100 marines from the Navy Yard to Guantanamo first.

<p>Recognizing Intervention as a Last Resort</p>
<p>Hoping that Cuba Will Quickly Stabilize its Political Situation</p>
<p>(Washington) Although Havana seems peaceful on the outside today, American President Roosevelt again stated tonight that the American government is using various methods to avoid military intervention in the Cuban revolution, which shows the seriousness of the situation behind the scenes. Moreover, seeing the dispatch of battleships to Cuba, it can also be known that the situation is not optimistic. Some foreign politicians have said that Cuba is the key to the entire situation in Latin America, and American intervention will greatly damage the relationship between the United States and the countries of Latin America. The American [President] specifically pointed out today that Cuba has never been the key to America's [unclear] with Latin America, and the relationship between the countries of the Western Hemisphere [unclear] with America has never been disturbed by America's military activities in Cuba. Moreover, the treaties signed between Cuba [unclear] and the United States specifically stipulate that the United States may intervene [unclear] to maintain Cuba's independence, maintain order within the island, and ensure financial security. According to reports, the American president stated this morning that in his mind, intervention is a last resort, and he indicated that even if intervention is necessary, he will focus on maintaining order in order to wait for Cuba to form a stable political situation [unclear]. In addition, it was also stated within the State Department that the United States has no intention of acting on behalf of the Cuban government, and the Navy Department also expressed its hope that Cuba would quickly stabilize its political situation.</p>
<p>Between these two statements from the White House, what is the situation in Cuba? There is no definite news from outside. According to unconfirmed news, the troops in Santa Clara Province have failed to maintain the local area, and rioters have seized a large sugar factory and want to implement the Soviet system. Another unconfirmed news claims that there is discord between the soldiers of the army and navy, and a new revolution is brewing. An incident is imminent. Although the Havana telegraph cannot confirm these messages, [unclear] also indicates that the position of the Revolutionary Committee is not very stable. According to Ambassador Wells' report, the committee relies on the army to gain power, but its orders cannot be enforced among the troops. Although Wells' telegrams have not been published in the past, it is rumored that he is quite concerned about the sudden rise of extreme radicals. According to reports, former Cuban President Machado had doubts about the "redification" of university professors, claiming that these people's attitudes were too radical and dangerous, and decisively closed Havana University, which shows the [unclear] understanding of class ideology in Cuba.

<p>(Washington) In the diplomatic history of the United States and the countries of Latin America, today is the second time that the American president has invited neighboring countries to assist in maintaining peace. When the American president received an urgent telegram from American Ambassador Wells in Cuba, reporting that the number of people dissatisfied with the new Cuban government was increasing and the situation was becoming more dangerous, he immediately invited the ambassadors of Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and Mexico to the White House and asked them to assist the American president in trying to avoid intervention in Cuba. Roosevelt quoted Wells' telegram and said that he was quite worried about the situation in Cuba, but he would definitely take no action if he could avoid intervention. However, the situation in Cuba is deteriorating day by day, people are discontinuing their studies, agricultural work is being abandoned, and both public and private sectors are depleted. Therefore, he requested the great ambassadors to consult with their respective governments on whether they could find a way to enable Cuban leaders to establish a government to maintain order and restore the economy. He also said that Cuban army and navy soldiers are easily exploited by radicals and dangerous elements to take harmful actions. It is heard that the great ambassadors agreed to convey this to their respective governments and do their best to stabilize the political situation in Cuba within the possible scope. According to reports, the American president took this action because he felt that the countries of Latin America could speak to Cuban leaders more frankly than the United States. Therefore, he imitated the precedent of President Wilson in 1914, who asked Argentina, Brazil, and Chile to assist in mediating the Mexican conflict. (National Telegram, 6th)</p>

<p>Washington's Second Cuban Revolution Its inside story seems to be an anti-American movement. This movement was incited by the attitude of large American industrialists in Cuba who supported Machado. Since Machado's overthrow, the anti-American movement has been secretly brewing, but Cuban Americans mistakenly believed it was insignificant and did not take precautions, leading to this incident. The second revolution can be regarded as an anti-American movement to a considerable extent. (Havas Telegram, 6th)</p>

Davis will meet with Disarmament Conference Chairman Henderson in a day or two and wants to talk with British Prime Minister MacDonald. If the British Prime Minister does not return to London in the middle of next week, Davis may visit him in Scotland. Davis is scheduled to go to Paris next Thursday to participate in the talks between French Prime Minister Daladier and British Undersecretary of Foreign Affairs Eden. What Davis and British Prime Minister Simon discussed today was mostly based on France's previous proposal for international management of armaments. British and French people</p>
<p>Because of irresponsible news coming from the United States, thinking that the United States has fully agreed to French Prime Minister Daladier's plan, Davis had to state that the American government has not adopted any special plan, but only supports the French proposal in principle. Davis also explained that if a period of trial management of armaments is stipulated, and when this period expires, countries can resume arms competition, the American delegation will definitely not agree to it. America advocates monitoring armaments, considering this as the only tool to eliminate any country's doubts about secretly increasing armaments. France now has this doubt about national socialist Germany. (Reuters Telegram, 5th)</p>
<p>(London) When the American representative to the Disarmament Conference, Davis, arrived in Europe, President Roosevelt gave him two letters when he departed from America, one to British Prime Minister MacDonald and one to French Prime Minister Daladier. Davis intends to wait for Britain and France to exchange opinions and make their views clearly expressed before contacting the French authorities and will only be willing to conduct negotiations after Britain and France have made effective preparations for disarmament work. The White House regards the issue of arms inspection as the main point of the disarmament issue and should fundamentally replace the security issue with arms inspection, because the White House considers monitoring armaments to be a practical way to obtain security objectively. Davis quite agrees with the automatic inspection system on this point. (Havas Telegram, 6th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The Times published a commentary on the issue of arms inspection, saying that world security cannot entirely rely on the arms inspection system. Even if the inspection is [unclear] seriously organized, it is still insufficient. Therefore, it is necessary to first [unclear] armaments within a considerable period of time to test the effectiveness of the inspection system. Only after testing can countries with sincerity [unclear] in good conscience and engage in the reduction of national defense armaments. If we want European countries to restore trust, this kind of trial is indispensable. The starting point of this trial is that the armaments of all countries should be openly shown without any secrets. For this reason, we believe that in order to organize a universal inspection system for armaments, it is necessary to first inspect Germany and other countries whose armaments are restricted by peace treaties, so that people can clearly understand the actual military strength they possess. As soon as German newspapers heard this proposal, they panicked in advance, fearing the rapprochement of British and French opinions. If Germany truly has the sincerity of peace as Hitler said, then this panic is incomprehensible, because if German armaments are truly within the scope stipulated by the treaty, why not borrow the inspection of all countries to prove its sincerity? If Germany has not complied with the treaty, then the inspection method can also make other countries understand what kind of credibility the promises that Geneva is about to issue will have.

<p>(Tokyo) Following the informal meeting between the government and the upper house on the 6th, the government and various factions within both houses of parliament have reached a consensus. Therefore, the government has decided to concretize emergency national policies. Those matters that are pressing and related to the budget must be included in the next fiscal year's budget. Therefore, Prime Minister Saito will take opportunities to gather ministers from each province to understand their intentions and request their investigation and research, without establishing a special organization for the time being. Concrete countermeasures will be established through consultation between the relevant provinces regarding diplomacy, national defense, education, finance, and rural issues.

<p>Lloyd George</p>
<p>Many Criticisms of Kitchener</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 7th: The first volume of former Liberal Party leader Lloyd George's memoirs of the European War was released today. It contains many criticisms of Kitchener and others during the war. This volume details the war up to 1915, stating that when the author began reorganizing the Ministry of Munitions, the War Office obstructed him. After the Battle of Neuve Chapelle, British Commander French complained about the insufficient supply of bullets and requested more. However, the War Office still used the argument that each gun in the artillery used 13 shells per day. Kitchener, as Secretary of State for War, was unaware that the Austrian troops had crossed the Danube River until 20 hours after the news reached the War Office. At a cabinet meeting, then-Justice Minister Carson, upon learning of this, whispered to the author, "Kitchener doesn't read telegrams, and we don't see him. What can be done?"</p>

<p>National News, Paris, 6th: According to a report from the Paris Times correspondent in Madrid, preparations for building a tunnel under the Strait of Gibraltar are now actively underway. Geologists have already conducted on-site surveys of the seabed in the area, and it is expected that a joint British-French-Spanish construction company will be established next year to implement the tunnel construction plan. There are no technical difficulties regarding the tunnel, but there is no connecting railway on the African continent, so it is necessary to simultaneously build a railway on the African continent to connect Europe and Africa before the construction of the tunnel can become a profitable project. The Paris Times reporter also stated that after the announcement of the Gibraltar tunnel plan, Italian political circles have felt extremely uneasy.</p>

<p>(Washington) Banks across the United States protested the Banking Act today. After the US President encouraged banks to freely lend to industries, they felt that the Banking Act was becoming increasingly difficult to implement. Bankers commonly said that without the deposit insurance fund stipulated in the Banking Act, they would be happy to freely lend. Now, with the restrictions of insurance, the losses after an industry failure would fall on the banks. Therefore, the banks in Chicago first resolved today to request the government to postpone the implementation of the deposit insurance system. As a result, banks throughout the country responded.

<p>Zamboanga (Philippines) Moro Muslims in the Philippines today openly clashed with police in the forests of Mount Kawa near the town of Panayaman. Seven policemen were killed, including Commander Babayna. The Moro suffered heavier casualties, with 11 killed and many wounded. The leader, Muhammad, was also seriously injured. Of the wounded policemen, seven have been transported back to Panayaman. According to police reports, Muhammad led a band of Moro rebels who frequently robbed and harassed the island of Zamboanga. Last Wednesday, Commander Babayna led police to suppress them, killing three, and the rest fled into the forest. However, Muhammad gathered the remaining rebels and ambushed the road yesterday as Babayna led the police in triumph, resulting in a fierce battle in the dense forest. It appeared that both sides had failed to win, so they each withdrew. Zamboanga is one of the Sulu Islands, and the Muslims there, due to religious and other disputes, do not want to be ruled by the Philippine government and have repeatedly petitioned the US government to be directly ruled by Washington.

<p>(Guangzhou) According to the Fisheries Bureau of the Department of Industry, the harvesting of kelp (i.e., agar-agar) on various islands in Hainan has recently been successful. Its properties are the same as that produced in Japan, only its gelling power is slightly weaker. In China, the consumption of agar-agar is quite large, especially in Zhejiang Province, where ordinary people use it as a daily food item. In the South China area, it is only used in the summer to make che lei (i.e., cold desserts). As most kelp is imported from Japan, there has been a shortage since the strict boycott of Japanese goods. The previous price was two yuan per catty, but it has now risen to ten yuan per catty.

<h3 id="e79">Public Telegram <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>A Public Telegram from Chuansha Asking for Disaster Relief to all Major Charitable Organizations and Philanthropists Nationwide: The Chuansha County has been unlucky and suffered a devastating typhoon, which wreaked havoc. Yuansha, Yuanyuansha, and other places, islands formed by silt in the sea off our county, are often hit by huge tides. This time, on September 1st, a sudden typhoon caused violent waves to surge, as if overturning mountains, causing the embankments to collapse and the entire island to sink. Houses were washed away, and there were few survivors. The numbers of people and livestock drowned are impossible to count. The disastrous calamity is unlike anything seen before. There are 2,000 households and nearly 10,000 people affected by the disaster. Now, although the typhoon has passed, the water has not completely receded. The disaster victims are gathered on the embankments, without houses to live in or food to eat, crying from hunger and cold, searching for relatives and companions, displaced and miserable. The cries of grief shake the heavens. In addition, the bodies of dead people and livestock have not yet been completely buried, and the stench is spreading, which will breed an epidemic. If relief is not provided urgently, there will be no survivors. Such a disaster is almost inhuman. Those who are spared share the same roots. To help those in difficulty and alleviate hardship is the principle of Zhou ritual, and to share in disasters and relieve suffering is human sympathy. We are heartbroken and grieved, hating that we have no ability to save all who are starving, and therefore imploring those who have the means to help. We respectfully request that you organize a relief committee to speak up for the poor. We believe that the benevolent gentlemen and philanthropists of our country will be deeply sympathetic to this tragic situation. We beg you to provide urgent relief to the disaster victims, who are in imminent danger. Your support is as crucial as a spark to dry tinder. We beseech you to show pity for the dying swans and undertake a charitable act. Please quickly provide donations of money or goods, or solicit donations from friends and relatives. Even a few leaves of shade from the mulberry field can become a great tree, and a spoonful of water from the ocean can become sweet rain. Help the dying and give flesh and bones to the dead, so that we can build the merit of three generations together and save those in danger, becoming the living Buddhas of ten thousand families. Li Leng, the County Magistrate of Chuansha, and the Chairman of the Relief Committee, and the entire committee bow and stamp their seals.</p>
<p>A Telegram Received. Shanghai Qipan Street Shen Bao Office: Chiang, Ma, Cheng, Fan, Zhang, Yang, and other bandit gangs, totaling over ten thousand people, have invaded the county, entrenched along the banks of the Sha River and the areas of the old county, Shiligou, Dahuangmiao, Guangwumiao, Cishengji, Lixingji, Huji, Gaimiao, Zhangcedian, Sanjiadian, Kuitaiji, Banqiaoji, Yuanyouji, and Anfengji for over twenty days. They have plundered and killed, causing countless deaths and injuries among the people, and almost no livestock remains. The county territory is vast, over a hundred li, and has been ravaged by the bandits several times. Except for the First District, which has a few survivors, the remaining four districts have been completely devastated. The disaster area is vast, and the survivors are crying out in misery, with no hope of survival. They are desperately in need of rescue. In addition to raising funds locally and sending a telegram to the provincial government requesting emergency relief funds, we earnestly request that you promote this widely and solicit donations on our behalf. We hope that your mighty pen will sprinkle the willow branches of mercy, so that even small contributions can accumulate into a great sum, supporting our survivors. We urgently appeal to you. The Anhui A He County Bandit Disaster Relief Committee kowtows.</p>
<p>A Dispatch from Dihua: Luo Junren, Minister of Foreign Affairs and Minister of Judicial Administration, is touring Xinjiang. The Zhenyi Record has published two diary entries detailing the situation in Lanzhou. Luo has now arrived safely in Dihua on the 2nd and had fruitful discussions with the military and political authorities of Xinjiang Province. Here is a further description of the events.</p>
<h3 id="e80">(15) A Brief Tour of Lanzhou <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>August 31st was an unusually sunny day. We prepared to continue our journey west at 8:00 AM, but as the luggage was being loaded, the airport reported that there was damage to the aircraft parts and that repairs were needed, so we could not fly today. So, we had to stay in Lanzhou for another day. Minister Luo was accompanied by Chairman Zhu Shaoliang, Director Deng Shiyi, and the heads of various departments to tour the famous scenic spots of Lanzhou. I and Lin and Wang went to see the Yellow River Iron Bridge in the morning. The bridge was built 20 or 30 years ago and cost over 200,000 yuan at the time. Now, it would cost more than a million to build. Transportation across the river is all done using bullskin rafts and sheepskin rafts. The bullskin rafts are made of dozens of whole cowhides, each sewn into the shape of a cow with cow and sheep wool, and then arranged in several rows or dozens of them, covered with bamboo strips. The sheepskin rafts are smaller, made of only a dozen sheepskins linked together. Each sheepskin is filled with air by hand and plugged with wool, so the sheepskin rafts are faster, while the bullskin rafts can carry more. The people of Gansu transport goods for export by water, using rafts to travel downstream, which is very fast. However, it is difficult to travel upstream, so they have to carry them back. In the afternoon, we visited the Five Springs Mountain. The mountain has five springs, hence the name. In fact, it is connected to the White Pagoda Mountain and is one mountain. The trees on Five Springs Mountain are lush and green, very different from the barren yellow earth of other mountains. The climate inside the mountain is very cool and refreshing. If you are talking about escaping the summer heat, then even the mountain residences of Kuling are not far off. At 3:00 PM, Chairman Ma Qing called a theater troupe to the People's Education Hall and invited Minister Luo to listen to the play. At 6:00 PM, he hosted a banquet. Minister Luo had a long and pleasant conversation with Chairman Ma.</p>
<h3 id="e81">(16) Welcome in the Suburbs of Liangzhou <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>September 1st was a day of clear skies and ten thousand miles of cloudless sky, truly ideal weather for flying. At around 7:00 AM, we took a car from the provincial government to the airport. Chairman Zhu, Chairman Ma, Director Deng, the heads of various departments, the President of the High Court, and all the important people of the province, as well as military police bands, went to the airport to see us off. At 8:30 AM, we took off. We originally planned to go straight to Xinjiang Province, but the military and political authorities, people's organizations, and groups from Liangzhou and Ganzhou sent telegrams insisting that we stay for one night, so we could not delay along the way. At 10:00 AM, we arrived at Liangzhou Longluo Airport. Ma Buqing, Commander of the 1st Cavalry Division, led soldiers and County Magistrate Xu Guyuan led the people to welcome us. They insisted on inviting us to visit the city, but because the distance was too far and time was limited, we did not go. Immediately, a welcome rally was held on the welcome platform set up at the airport. County Magistrate Xu and representatives of various circles, Mr. So-and-so, first delivered welcome speeches, expressing their gratitude for the central government's concern for the Northwest. Minister Luo also gave a speech of encouragement, urging the people of all ethnic groups to live in equality and harmony and work together to strengthen the country and promote the prosperity of the Northwest. After the meal, we hurriedly flew west at 11:00 AM. Liangzhou is now called Wuwei County. It used to have a population of over 100,000, but after the 17th year earthquake and years of military disasters and famines, it now has only tens of thousands.</p>
<h3 id="e82">(10)(7) Donkey Cart Bumps to Suzhou <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>Passing Liangzhou and looking west, the Qilian Mountains stretch endlessly. The mountain peaks are covered in snow that gradually melts. Looking east, there is a vast, boundless desert. The journey by car is quite rough. Arriving at Lanzhou at 3 PM, the airport is about forty miles from the city, a desolate expanse of yellow sand. It's frighteningly desolate. Except for a few words on a mound of earth at the north end of the airport, the station consists of only two simple tents set up by the welcoming party, barely enough space to stand. After entering the tent to rest and drink tea, Qin Sheng-san, Chief of Staff sent by Ma Bu-kang, the Brigade Commander of the First Brigade of the Second Cavalry Division, and County Magistrate Wei Yu-xuan, among others, insisted on inviting us to the city. Their hospitality was irresistible, and since the plane could not fly that day, Minister Luo and I went along, while Mr. Lin Wu-er remained at the airport. The donkey cart rumbled incessantly, causing endless shaking. I felt dizzy, my head swam, and my intestines nearly burst. We didn't arrive in Suzhou city until 6 PM. Soldiers, police, and students were all lined up outside the city to welcome us. After arriving at the guesthouse, I met and talked with Brigade Commander Ma Bu-kang. After dinner, at 8 PM, we returned to the city gate by donkey cart, not reaching the airport until around 1 AM. The round trip of eighty miles took eight hours, leaving me both mentally and physically exhausted. I fell into bed and was almost unconscious. Suzhou is now called Jiuquan County, named for a spring within the city that contains wine. It is about sixty or seventy miles from the Qilian Mountains and receives no rain throughout the year. Cultivation relies entirely on snowmelt from the mountains for irrigation, so the stronger the sunlight, the more abundant the snowmelt, as if the sunlight were replacing rain. The main produce is wheat. Jiayu Pass is only thirty miles from the city. The area outside the pass, in Yumen County, has abundant coal oil, flowing everywhere. It can be scooped up and used for lamps, but no one develops it, leaving valuable goods discarded on the ground. It's truly a pity. The climate in Suzhou is very hot during the day, like sweltering humidity. Even wearing a single layer feels too thick, while the mornings and evenings are bitterly cold, like harsh winter. Even leather clothes don't feel warm enough, typical of a desert climate. There are no precise population statistics. A survey in the 15th year of the Republic stated there were fifty to sixty thousand residents, but there are fewer now.</p>
<h3 id="e83">(10)(8) Brief Stop in Hami, Meeting the Uyghur King <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>On September 2nd, at about 5 AM, I was groggily awakened by Mr. Lin and Mr. Wang. I was so stiff I could hardly get up. After Mr. Lin's strong encouragement, I managed to leave the bed. At 6 AM, we boarded the plane heading west. The morning air was clear, and the flight was very smooth. At 8:30 AM, we arrived in Hami. The entire route from Suzhou to Hami is desert, and Hami city is built in the midst of this desert. I had previously arranged to meet Ma Zhongying in Hami when I was in Lanzhou. Upon reaching Suzhou, I received a telegram from Zhang Feng-ming, the Hami Defense Commissioner, informing me that Ma was in Turpan and inviting Minister Luo to meet him there. Those who welcomed us at the Hami airport included Zhang Feng-ming, the City Defense Commissioner, He Ding, the County Magistrate, and Zhang Yan-ling, the Chief of Logistics from Ma Zhongying's forces, who had come from Turpan, as well as dozens of others. The Hami Uyghur King, Niezier, and his son, Bo-xi-er, were also present. The Uyghur King's official title is "Hami Local Mongolian Hereditary First-Class Zasake Double Prince." His son, Bo-xi-er, is currently serving as the Turpan City Defense Commissioner. After disembarking from the plane, Zhang Yan-ling, Ma Zhongying's representative, reported to Minister Luo that Ma could not come to Hami due to the importance of defense. He also requested that Minister Luo visit Turpan. Minister Luo explained that due to unexpected delays along the way, he had been away for a long time, and the Eurasia No. 1 plane needed to return to Shanghai. He had to go to Dihua first and would arrange a meeting in Turpan after arriving there. Zhang and others then invited Minister Luo to tour Hami city and collect taxes. Hami city is about three miles from the airport. A short car ride brought us there. First, we arrived at the guesthouse where Minister Luo and the Uyghur King had a long conversation. The Uyghur King first recounted the suffering the Uyghur people had endured from oppression. Minister Luo then conveyed the central government's kindness, stating that the Three Principles of the People advocated by the Premier stressed that all ethnic groups within the country were equal. The central government was also vigorously implementing this policy, showing deep concern, and would strive to improve Xinjiang's politics and stabilize order, ensuring equality for all ethnic groups, complete religious freedom, allowing people to live in peace and work happily, and jointly seek prosperity. After listening, the Uyghur King said that he had previously lived in darkness but today had the honor of seeing Minister Luo's esteemed face and hearing his teachings, as if seeing the light of day. He would guide the Uyghur people to obey the central and local governments. During the conversation, the Uyghur King also presented a memorial, written in the Uyghur language, awaiting translation. Various community leaders and all the Uyghur people in Hami city also presented memorials and requested an audience with Minister Luo. Minister Luo, accompanied by the Uyghur King, Zhang Yan-ling, and Zhang Feng-ming, left the guesthouse. The Uyghur people knelt to express their suffering. Minister Luo comforted them kindly, and the Uyghur people were moved to tears. Afterward, he toured the city with the Uyghur King and others.</p>
<h3 id="e84">(10)(9) Talking About the Uyghur City <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>Hami has three cities... where people live, Uyghur... are also mixed among them... originally... where troops were stationed. One is the Uyghur City, where the Uyghur King resides. Many other Uyghur... people live in the mountains... This... originated in Hami. The feelings between the Uyghur and Han people in Hami are difficult... to reconcile. Military and political... power is entirely in the hands of Han people... Many Uyghur... people are treated... in a way that has long caused resentment. When Jin Shuren initially implemented his new policies, things were peaceful. However, in the 20th year of the Republic, Jin Shuren abolished the Uyghur King's hereditary... position. Due to improper handling, Hami was divided into three counties, and... Uyghur... cultivated land was given... to Han people to cultivate, leading to extreme backlash and a conspiracy to revolt. Representatives were sent to contact Ma Zhongying, stationed in Gansu, to request military assistance. The Xinjiang... unrest began here. At the beginning of the incident, the old Uyghur King of Hami had just passed away. After the current Uyghur King took office, he went to the provincial capital to express his gratitude. Jin Shuren immediately detained him... The Uyghur King has always been extremely... kind to the Uyghur living in the mountains, who have long been dissatisfied. Seeing the situation, the Uyghur King urgently went to the provincial capital to request protection... whether this is right or wrong remains to be investigated. After the Hami incident occurred, the war continued until this spring when it finally... ended. Details of the events will be described later. However, the three cities of Hami have been devastated by this turmoil. When we inspected the cities, we saw ruins and rubble everywhere, a terrible sight to behold. In particular, the Uyghur City was completely deserted, a... barren land. Minister Luo, in order to convey the central government's kindness, specially used the central government's name to provide one thousand yuan to the Uyghur King to help... the disaster victims. The Uyghur King and the Uyghur people were moved to tears. Currently, there are several hundred households in Hami, of which about a dozen are Han Chinese. About three-quarters of the land is barren. King Niezier... is still planning to inherit the throne... this month. Some Uyghur... people are also against... the restoration. Hami is in the desert, and the climate is extremely... hot. The most famous product is the Hami melon. The melon is... round, quite similar to the honeydew melons of Beijing and Shanghai, but it tastes... much better... than others, and is four or five times larger.</p>
<h3 id="e85">(10)(20) Rocking in the Wind and Rain, Arriving in Dihua <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>After staying in Hami for about an hour, we flew west. It was expected that we would arrive in Dihua around 1 PM. However, when flying near Gucheng, we suddenly encountered strong winds and heavy rain. Near Dihua, the pilot... lost his way and circled the nearby mountains for an hour and a half. The situation was extremely dangerous and anxious. Fortunately, the pilot of the No. 1 plane was highly skilled, and at 2:45 PM, we landed safely at Dihua Airport. At that time, Dihua was experiencing heavy rain. The welcoming party and soldiers were soaked. The soldiers had arrived at the airport at 8 AM to line up, and had changed shifts three times due to the rain. Shortly after the plane stopped, Liu Wenlong, the Chairman of the Xinjiang Provincial Government, and Sheng Shicai, the Border Defense Commissioner, arrived by car to welcome us. We then rode into the city in the same car as Minister Luo and stayed at the Foreign Affairs Office. After a short rest, Liu and Sheng held a banquet at the office to welcome us, and we had a pleasant conversation. I was exhausted from the journey, so I rested at the office and decided to begin working with all parties the next day to stabilize the new situation. All parties in Xinjiang had been eagerly awaiting the arrival of a high-ranking central government official, so they greatly welcomed Minister Luo's visit to Xinjiang. For example, in the business community, hearing that Minister Luo had arrived immediately caused prices to fall significantly. They believed that Minister Luo's visit demonstrated the central government's concern for the border situation and that he would definitely assist the provincial government in resolving various difficulties and stabilizing the situation in Xinjiang.</p>
<h3 id="e86">(10)(21) Overview of the Current Situation in Xinjiang <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>The current situation in Xinjiang is generally stable. Ma Zhongying's forces have been absorbed by the provincial government and appointed as the Eastern Route Garrison Commander. However, southern Xinjiang remains isolated and communication is completely cut off. The most important issues currently facing Xinjiang are stabilizing the southern route and reorganizing finances. Xinjiang's currency system is extremely chaotic, and there is an absolute shortage of cash. Central government banknotes are not circulating, and market transactions rely entirely on provincial currency. The value of provincial banknotes fluctuates wildly every day. Today, the market rate is fifty provincial banknotes to one national currency. If the currency is not rectified quickly, Xinjiang's finances will collapse soon. Minister Luo will stay in Dihua for half a month to assist the provincial government in resolving all the difficult issues. His tasks mainly include witnessing the inauguration of Liu Wenlong as Chairman of the Provincial Government and Sheng Shicai as Border Defense Commissioner, discussing the organization of the provincial government, unifying the central government's diplomatic power, stabilizing southern Xinjiang, and reorganizing finances. Chairman Liu is experienced and cautious, with a deep understanding of the political situation. Commissioner Sheng is young and talented, with exceptional abilities. Xinjiang's future holds great promise. Minister Luo also plans to invite Ma Zhongying to visit the province to allow all parties to speak frankly and jointly discuss the aftermath. If Ma does not come, Minister Luo will personally visit Turpan. After meeting with Ma, he will travel to Yining to meet with Commander Zhang Peiyuan and inspect the border situation. Then, he will go to southern Xinjiang to comfort and appease... the Uyghurs to achieve the overall unity of Xinjiang. (Dispatch from Dihua, September 2nd)</p>
<h3 id="e87">Chairman Chiang Kai-shek Convenes a Grain Management Conference <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>To Jointly Plan Relief for Rural Areas and Regulate Food Supply</p>
<p>Dispatch from Guling: Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, in order to regulate the food supply, has been actively promoting the storage of grain to fill granaries. Yesterday, he specifically sent telegrams to the provincial governments of Jiangxi, Hunan, Hubei, Henan, Anhui, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Guangdong, and Shanghai, instructing them to each send a representative familiar with rural conditions and experienced in grain management to gather in Jiangxi before October 20th to jointly decide on measures. The telegram reads as follows: "Our country is founded on agriculture, and the grain issue is related to the people's livelihood, and also the foundation of the nation. In recent years, the situation in rural areas has been such that even in years of famine, hunger is inevitable, and in years of good harvest, grain prices fall, harming farmers. The farmers' pain is reaching... a breaking point, causing social unrest and crises on all sides.</p>
<h3 id="e88">Continued from Page 11 <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<h2>Page 11</h2>
<p>The path to relief lies, first, in appropriately adjusting the surplus and deficit of grain in each province, blocking the intrusion of foreign rice; second, in storing half a year's worth of grain to prepare for times of famine and drought; and third, in activating rural finance to stabilize the drastic fall in grain prices. This year, the provinces along the Yangtze River have a good harvest in autumn, and it is imperative to take advantage of this favorable opportunity to comprehensively plan for the fundamental relief of rural areas. Therefore, several items are proposed for handling, with the following guidelines: (1) Jiangxi and Hunan provinces are both major rice-producing areas and should immediately seek ways to communicate with Guangdong and Shanghai, which have traditionally been grain-deficient areas. Consult with the authorities in those provinces and cities to encourage grain merchants to purchase grain from the Yangtze River region as much as possible to resist the transport of foreign rice to the interior. At the same time, the provinces along the Yangtze River should provide various conveniences to grain merchants from Guangdong and Shanghai to attract them. (2) Implement grain storage and restore the old system of local granaries. The Wuhan Headquarters repeatedly issued orders and sent letters to various provinces last year urging them to handle this matter. It should be checked and thoroughly implemented to achieve practical results. (3) It is proposed to request the central government to create new-style granaries in the provinces under the cotton and wheat loan program to handle rice storage, loan collateral, and coordinate transportation and sales to regulate the food supply, raise grain prices, and circulate rural finance. In the future, circulating funds will be vigorously assisted by the farmers' banks in the four provinces. By striving to move forward in accordance with the above guidelines, the essential plan to relieve the rural economy will not be just empty words. However, the details of this matter are very complex and difficult to handle. To seek practical results, it is necessary to gather experts for careful deliberation. It is hoped that each provincial government will send a representative familiar with rural conditions and well-versed in warehouse systems and grain management to gather in Jiangxi before October 20th to jointly discuss and decide on a method and implement it accordingly."

<p>丨Jiang and others also hold inauguration ceremonies丨</p>
<p>Dispatch from Guangzhou: After the Haiqi, Haichen, and Zhaohua warships came south, they were reorganized by Chen Jitang into the Guangdong Naval Fleet. It was not until August 28th that the officers of the three ships officially took office. At 9 AM that morning, after the Southwest Political Council held its memorial week, the inauguration ceremony was held for Jiang Xiyuan, the commander of the fleet, Ran Honghe, the captain of the Haiqi warship, Tang Jing, the executive officer, Guan Jizhou, the captain of the Haichen warship, Zhang Fengren, the executive officer (absent), Yang Chaolun, the captain of the Zhaohua warship, Li Baolin, the executive officer, and Zhao Zonghan, the chief instructor. After each person raised their hand and took the oath, the oath administrator, Chen Jitang, delivered a speech, first stating the significance of the three warships coming south to jointly overcome national difficulties, and then explaining the importance of the oath. After the speech, Jiang Xiyuan gave a reply. After the ceremony, they dispersed. The next day (29th), Jiang, accompanied by Zhao Zonghan, who was also acting as the chief of staff, Zhang Zhenyu, the adjutant, Huang Qiang, the paymaster, and staff officers Ding Qizhang and Xu Shijun, went to Huangpu to review the three warships. After Jiang inspected each warship, he gathered all the officers and soldiers for a speech, briefly stating that the Second World War was already brewing, and that all naval personnel should be vigilant and never forget the slogan of serving the country with fervent blood. We have come from Qingdao with difficulty, not for personal gain, but to seek survival for the party and the country. Guangdong is the source of the revolution and stands on the same front as us. We should have an opportunity to work hard. However, if we want to serve the country, we must first serve the group. To serve the group, we must start with individual efforts. I hope that in the future, all personnel will always check their work and not be unworthy of their positions. After the speech, they took a photo and then Jiang and the others returned to Guangzhou.

<h3 id="e90">Hankou Postal Workers' Strike <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>Demanding Recognition of the Union and Implementing a Go-Slow</p>
<p>Postmaster Telegraphed the Head Office to Request Instructions</p>
<p>Dispatch from Hankou: The Hankou Postal Workers' Union was formally established in April of this year, having been approved and registered with the Central Party Headquarters, the Hankou Special Municipal Party Headquarters, and the Municipal Government. At that time, they requested recognition from the Hubei Postal Administration, but the Bureau ignored them, even refusing to accept letters. As a result, the union's affairs were greatly constrained. At the same time, the workers' treatment, in terms of allowances and clothing, was far behind that of the bureaus in Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, and other places, which caused resentment. Since there was much misunderstanding between the authorities and the workers, a labor strike was inevitable. On the 4th of this month, all postal workers held a temporary representatives' conference and invited Wu Shao-shu, a member of the Municipal Party Headquarters, to attend and provide guidance. It was decided on the spot to elect ten representatives, along with all the executive and supervisory committee members of the union, to petition the Municipal Party Headquarters and send representatives to negotiate with the Postmaster, immediately requesting formal written recognition of the union. The workers also attached the following requirements: (1) Hankou Bureau workers should receive the same treatment as Shanghai Bureau workers. (2) Following the example of unions in other places, the union should receive a monthly subsidy of one hundred yuan. (3) Union workers should be guaranteed and provided with convenience. At 1 PM on the afternoon of the 6th, all the representatives and committee members went to the Municipal Party Headquarters to petition. Wu Shao-shu and Yang Xing-qin, two committee members, received them, expressing sympathy for the demands. The Municipal Party Headquarters appointed Committee Member Wu and dispatched You Ding-yi, the director of the Civil Affairs Section, to accompany the petition representatives to the Post Office. Wu Shao-shu first negotiated with the Postmaster, Mr. Smith, explaining that the establishment of the Postal Workers' Union had been approved by the Central Party Headquarters and the Hankou Special Municipal Party Headquarters, making it a legal organization that should be recognized by the Bureau. He also pointed out that postal workers' unions in other places had been recognized and assisted by local post offices, such as in Beijing and Shanghai, as well as the nearby city of Changsha, which already had precedents. Why should Hankou be different? He repeatedly tried to persuade him, but Mr. Smith remained unyielding, and his attitude was even more stubborn than before, with no room for compromise on the workers' demands. Deputy Officer Liu of the Garrison Command tried to mediate but had no effect. All the workers of the Bureau believed that the Postmaster was extremely oppressive, and they were so indignant that they went on a spontaneous go-slow at 2:30 PM. The Police Department and the Third Special District Police Station, fearing an incident, immediately sent soldiers and police to the scene to maintain order. Postmaster Mr. Smith, seeing the workers' firm determination, softened his attitude and agreed to telegraph the Head Office for instructions, with a three-day deadline for a reply. He also signed to accept the union's official letter. Although the workers expressed dissatisfaction, they were persuaded by the officials and police to refrain from insisting. Thereupon, Wu Shao-shu announced to the crowd, asking them to resume work and wait for a resolution. Deputy Postmaster Liu Yao-ting also reported that the Bureau had no prejudice against recognizing the union, but it was just a matter of time. The union officials then advocated temporarily resuming work and waiting for a resolution. At 4:30 PM, all the workers resumed work. It was fortunate that the go-slow lasted only two hours. (6th)</p>
<h3 id="e91">Jiangsu Province Levies a Perpetual Tenancy Tax <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>Five Jiao of Silver Per Mu, Paid by the Perpetual Tenant</p>

<p>Article 1: Anyone who has tenancy rights on cultivated or pastoral land and enters into a contract for its transfer shall pay deed tax in accordance with the provisions of these regulations. The perpetual tenancy referred to in the preceding paragraph refers to what is commonly known as field surface, field pits, fertile soil, and the like. The perpetual contract referred to in this article refers to various perpetual tenancy agreements entered into in accordance with local customs, such as field surface deeds, transfer deeds, pre-agreements, and the like, which have the nature of perpetual tenancy.

<h3 id="e92">Anhui Business Federation Requests Cessation of the Import Tax on Foreign Rice <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>Foreign rice imports encroach on the domestic rice market. Please levy taxes immediately to maintain the rural economy.</p>
<p>Dispatch from Wuhu: The Anhui Provincial Chamber of Commerce Federation and the Wuhu County Chamber of Commerce believe that in recent years, domestic rice prices have been declining, and the rural economy has become universally bankrupt. Even the cities are on the verge of collapse. The reason is that foreign rice is rampant and occupies the market. Rice-producing areas are becoming overstocked, leading to this situation. For example, the Guangdong and Guangxi provinces have always been areas for Anhui rice sales, but now they have been almost entirely occupied by foreign rice. The only solution is to increase the import tax on foreign rice to protect the domestic rice market. Therefore, today (1st), telegrams were sent to the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Industry, and the Ministry of Interior, requesting that they immediately adopt the suggestion of the five provincial governments of Hunan, Hubei, Anhui, Jiangxi, and Henan to implement the increased import tax on foreign rice. The original telegram reads, "Respectfully to the Executive Yuan, Ministry of Interior, Ministry of Finance, and Ministry of Industry in Nanjing: Reports indicate that the five provincial governments of Hunan, Hubei, Anhui, Jiangxi, and Henan have telegraphed the Central Government to implement an increased import tax on foreign rice to resist it and maintain the rural economy. This is welcome news, and it benefits all the people. We ask your esteemed Yuan to describe and present it in detail. Since foreign rice imports, they initially sold well in Guangdong and Guangxi, seizing our market, which could be considered a supplement to the famine in the south and was beneficial to the people's food supply. Later, taking advantage of the tax-free advantage of foreign rice, they dumped it into the coastal and riverine provinces, encroaching on our country's grain sales market, so that in the 20th year, after the great flood, the vitality of the disaster-stricken provinces was mostly not restored. They relied entirely on agricultural income to maintain their livelihoods, but rice prices plummeted, and the funds they earned from selling grain were not enough to pay for farming. Years of good harvest did not satisfy them, and banditry increased. The harm to farmers from cheap grain is pitiable. As for the landowners, the highest-yielding fields harvest one hundred forty to fifty catties of rice per mu, the next-best fields harvest seventy to eighty catties, and the next again harvest forty to fifty catties. The price of rice is two yuan per dan, but the taxes and local surcharges, as well as all the expenses for harvesting rice, amount to two yuan five to six jiao per mu, or at least one yuan seven to eight jiao. For fields flooded in spring or dried up in summer, even if not a blade of grass is harvested, the taxes, surcharges, and flood prevention costs cannot be avoided. It has long been the norm to compensate for abandoned fields. Therefore, families with land are all suffering due to the impact of cheap grain. Fields that were previously worth one hundred yuan per mu are now devalued to thirty to forty yuan, and no one will buy them. The reason is that foreign rice dumping has caused grain prices to fall daily. As a result, rural areas are bankrupt, purchasing power is weak, commercial markets are depressed, finance is stagnant, and workers are unemployed, all of which are affected. According to reports from chambers of commerce in various places, Anhui's rice and grain have traditionally been marketed in Guangdong, Chaozhou, Guangxi, and other places, but since foreign rice imports, they have been invisibly squeezed out, and sales have been shrinking daily. Recently, they have been selling at a lower price, promoting it in the Yangtze River basin, so that last year it was already a year of good harvest and famine, and this year's new grain is even cheaper, and the farmers feel even more pain. Recently, bandits have been active in Hanshan, and the farmers have been coerced to follow them, which is not unrelated to the pressure of making a living. Looking to the future, we cannot help but shudder. We can only telegraph your esteemed Yuan to observe that our country's rice and grain have been encroached upon by foreign rice, the sales value is falling daily, and all the people are affected, threatening a total collapse. Adopt the proposals of the five provincial governments of Hunan, Hubei, Anhui, Jiangxi, and Henan to implement an import tax on foreign rice to save the situation and restore the people's livelihood. We cannot wait to be ordered. Wu Xingzhou and others, the chairman of the Anhui Provincial Chamber of Commerce Federation and the Wuhu County Chamber of Commerce, respectfully salute you." (1st)</p>
<h3 id="e93">Southern Hui Dike Collapses, Causing Disaster <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>More Than a Thousand Households Submerged</p>
<p>Dispatch from Nanhui: A hurricane passed through our county the other day, with strong winds and heavy rain,</p>
<p>non-stop day and night, causing heavy damage everywhere. Because traffic was disrupted at the time and telephones were out of service, it was impossible to find out the details. Now, after investigating various places, we have learned that the eastern Xiang dike on the coastal road in the first district collapsed for more than thirty zhang, about four to five hundred zhang in the Zhunan and Wangtan two Xiang, and the dikes around Wanghailou in the Siquan area were damaged north and south for dozens of zhang. For a time, the tide rushed into the plains in each of these places, with water six to seven feet deep. Many houses collapsed, and people and animals were killed or injured. In the second district, the newly built set dike in Wuliuqi Tuan was washed away for twenty li north and south, and more than a thousand households were submerged. Many people and animals were also killed or injured. In the fourth district, the dike body from Ligongtang, newly opened port, to the Xihe port was breached, and the water cave collapsed. The Liuzaogang water cave collapsed for more than three zhang, and the dike body south of the cave collapsed for six to seven zhang. The newly built set dike collapsed for about ten zhang. The Dongligongtang and the newly built preparation dikes were also washed away for seven to eight zhang. The residents in that area barely escaped with their lives, suffering considerable losses, which were even worse than the floods of the 20th year. Now, the county party headquarters and the county government have received reports from various disaster-stricken areas. Yesterday, Zhang Longjiang, a member of the standing committee, and Yuan Xiluo, the county head, went down to the villages to survey the disaster and will decide on relief methods.</p>

<p>Lu, a woman from Shen Dianqiao in Suzhou (also known as A'erbao), 23 years old, was returning home from Suzhou on the 6th. While passing near Shen Dianqiao, she was suddenly stopped by three thugs, Tian Shougen, Tian Jinpu, and Chen A'ansheng. They forced Lu to the ground by the side of a field, one holding her hands, one holding her feet, and the other committing rape. Afterward, they robbed her of a gold ring, a pair of gold bracelets, and twelve silver dollars before fleeing. Lu, unable to resist alone, immediately returned home to inform her husband, who reported the crime to the police and requested an investigation.</p>

<p>The Business Tax Bureau has repeatedly received provincial orders to eliminate the practice of business tax being handled by trade associations and to directly collect taxes from households. They are scheduled to begin investigating business operations and capital amounts on a household basis from the 11th of this month. However, various trade associations are not very satisfied with the household investigation, believing it will disturb businesses. They have requested the Chamber of Commerce to find a way to achieve the goal of package recognition. However, the bureau believes that it is difficult to achieve due to provincial orders and tax amount considerations. There may be some negotiations at that time.</p>

<p>Weng Zhendong, a villager from Xue Dianxiang in the twelfth district of the county, was kidnapped by bandits on September 29th of last year and held for ransom. Subsequently, Zhu Meiji, the head of the eighth district's defense corps, apprehended the bandits Fang Laifu, A'shi, Xu Fengchi, Zhuang Shigen, and Shi Rengen, and rescued the victim. The five bandits were presented to the county government and transferred to the county court. The court sentenced Fang, Zou, and Xu to death. Later, because Xu only wrote the ransom letter on behalf of the others, the High Court sent the case back for a retrial. The cases of Fang and Zou were forwarded to the provincial government for approval by the High Court. The provincial government issued an order to the county court to notify them. Chief Judge Xu sent a letter to the Procuratorate for execution. Chief Prosecutor Zhou signed the order at 4:30 PM the day before yesterday to take the two prisoners for identification. He then sent Prosecutor Shen as the supervising officer to escort Fang and Zou to the south drill ground for execution by firing squad.</p>
<h3 id="e99">The Repercussions of Organizing a Stone Powder Trust <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>The two stone powder factories in this county, Chengtai and Chengda, produce more than 800,000 dan of powder each year, 80-90% of which is sold to rice mills. They can make a huge profit of 150,000 to 200,000 yuan per year. Last year, Hu Jia and other citizens from Nanli submitted a petition to the Ministry of Industry, requesting the county to strictly prohibit the addition of this stone powder to rice, as it was harmful to health. After receiving the petition, the Ministry of Industry forwarded it to the Health Testing Laboratory. The test results showed that it was not related to health, and its use was allowed. As a result, the business of the two factories became even more developed, while the light powder industry suffered a strong enemy and declined to the point of complete stagnation. Recently, the owner of the factory, Zou Chongfan, and others, seeing the huge profits involved, contacted the Shenchang and Ruichang powder factories in Shanghai and organized a stone powder trust, named Ruichang Cheng. It is expected to produce about 2 million bags of powder per year, with a profit of about 600,000 yuan. As for the raw materials used, they have signed a contract with the owner of Changxing Mountain to exclusively use white stone for 12 years, stipulating that it cannot be resold to other new factories. New regulations have also been set for the price of stone powder: retail price is five jiao per bag, no arrears are allowed, and new scales must be used. When stone powder is delivered to the rice mills, a handling fee and labor fee must be added. These new regulations were implemented on the first of this month. After learning about this, the rice mills and rice shops in the county protested one after another. They held a relief meeting at a rice shop in Beizhako, deciding that all rice mills would switch to using air blasting and not use stone powder for mixing, and advocating the restoration of light powder to resist.</p>

<p>The long-term major bandit gangs in northern Anhui, led by Zhang Dabizi, Ma Changshou, Han Shengming, Liu Guozhong, and Ding Si, captured Hanshan County on the 27th of last month, looting and robbing for two days and nights. They also released prisoners and committed rape and murder. Before leaving, they kidnapped more than 100 people, including Zhang Mutao, the head of the Finance Committee, local gentry Zhang Zhuting, Xia Maoxian, the manager of Houfu Oil Shop, the prison officer Ding Mo, and wealthy households. They originally wanted to escape back to their old nest in Chaohu, but were met with fierce attacks by the Red Spear Society in Zhaoqiao, which is under the jurisdiction of Chaoxian. They retreated to the mountains in the area bordering Hanshan, Chaoxian, and Quanxian, relying on the dangerous terrain to maintain their rampant position. The county magistrates of Hanshan and Wu have returned to Hanshan from Hexian to handle the aftermath. The post office has also been restored. It is reported that the capital has sent a part of the 88th Division to cross the river to suppress them. Chaoxian and Hexian have also sent local police to suppress them. The Hefei Security Corps headquarters has also been ordered to assist in the suppression. Yesterday morning, Wang Zongdui, along with two squadrons, passed through Zhegao and Xiagao to suppress them. It is expected that it will not be difficult to wipe them out.</p>

I have checked your newspaper's issue on the 31st of last month, which contained a very detailed report on this matter, and my name was not mentioned.

<p>9:00 AM at the Youth Propaganda Corps</p>
<p>Fly around the city in the afternoon to distribute leaflets</p>
<p>The Party Headquarters and the Navy both held banquets yesterday</p>
<p>After Sun Tonggang, a young pilot who studied in Germany, arrived in Shanghai with Wang Zuwen, the local Party Headquarters, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Municipal Education Association, the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, the Municipal Farmers' Association, and other organizations held a banquet at the Shanghai Joint Entertainment Club in the Silk Industry Building on Hankou Road yesterday afternoon. In the evening at 7:00 PM, the Naval Aircraft Division invited them to a banquet at the Naval Club. The Municipal Party Headquarters and various organizations will hold a welcome rally at the Youth Propaganda Corps in Xiaoximen at 9:00 AM this morning. This afternoon, Sun and Wang will fly the plane to inspect the war zone. Details are summarized below.</p>
<h3 id="e107">Yesterday Afternoon's Banquet <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>When the Municipal Party Headquarters and other organizations held a banquet at the Shanghai Joint Entertainment Club yesterday afternoon, those present, in addition to Sun Tonggang and Wang Zuwen, included Tong Xingbai, Zhou Feicheng, Pan Gongzhan, Tao Baichuan, Jiang Huaishu, Wu Kaixian, Cai Hongtian, Long Tiyao from the Municipal Party Headquarters; Wang Yansong from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce; Zheng Hongnian from the Municipal Education Association; Zhou Xuexiang from the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions; Yu Zhenhui from the Municipal Farmers' Association; Shen Junru from the Lawyers' Association; Xi Yushu from the Accountants' Association; Yu Hongjun, Secretary-General of the Municipal Government; Wen Hongen, Director of the Public Security Bureau; Xu Peihuang, Director of the Public Works Bureau; Shen Xiqing from the Shanghai District Court; Zhang Xiang, Acting Commander of the Garrison Headquarters; Jia Botao from the Security Office; and reporters from various newspapers, totaling more than 60 people.</p>
<h3 id="e108">Chairman's Speech <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>During the banquet, Pan Gongzhan, Standing Committee Member of the Municipal Party Headquarters, delivered a welcoming speech, saying, "Today, the Municipal Party Headquarters sincerely welcomes Comrade Sun Tonggang. A month ago, we heard that Comrade Sun flew back to China from Germany, setting a new long-distance flight record and bringing glory to the country, which made all the compatriots in the country feel excited. Since the January 28th Incident, Shanghai has been greatly stimulated. The phenomenon of enemy ravages has not yet disappeared. Comrade Sun flew around the country, all hoping to visit Shanghai as soon as possible and admire his demeanor. Today, the citizens' wishes have come true, which is very gratifying. We welcome him for three reasons: (1) In the face of the serious national crisis, in order to cope with the future international situation, our national defense, including the sea, land, and air forces, must make considerable efforts. However, in terms of the effectiveness of the times, air defense is especially important. Saving the country through aviation has become a consensus across the country. Therefore, we hope that Comrade Sun's feat can awaken the attention of the people across the country. (2) Nowadays, young people in general, especially college students, are enthusiastic about saving the country, have high aspirations, and are active in their actions. However, at the same time, they shout that there is no way out and feel bored, but they do not start from reality. This is caused by the bad influence of society. Today, Comrade Sun sacrifices everything for the needs of the country and puts it into practice, which can change the path of young people and guide them towards practical aspects. (3) The aviation industry is not limited to military affairs. We hope to become a normal business across the country. Under the guidance of the Shanghai Aviation Association, the aviation movement in Shanghai has achieved considerable success with the efforts of all the citizens. We hope that Comrade Sun will do his best to awaken the people in the interior so that aviation can become a popular business, and transportation will be developed, and the effect will be significant. We admire and respect Comrade Sun's actions this time. At the same time, we hope that Comrade Sun can continue to work hard and fulfill his aspiration to fly around the country in a self-made airplane."</p>
<h3 id="e109">Mr. Sun's Reply <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>Sun then replied, saying, "I feel ashamed to hear the chairman's words just now. I will definitely do my best to do it. I am very grateful for the welcome from all walks of life and hope for more guidance. When I went to Germany to study aviation, I was determined to fly back to China in my own airplane. Under various difficulties, I was fortunate to succeed. The details have been published in the newspaper and will not be repeated. The methods of world warfare are progressing day by day, from the plane to the three-dimensional. Since the European War, although countries have been afraid of war, judging from the failure of various peace conferences and the recent phenomenon of countries actively expanding their military equipment, a second world war is an inevitable fact. Our country is located in the Pacific Ocean and is the focus of the war. The construction of air defense cannot be delayed. We should follow the instructions of our Leader and 'don't follow others, but catch up from the front,' and quickly train aviation talents and build airplanes ourselves. I hope that all walks of life will not welcome Sun Tonggang alone, but welcome the four words 'Save the Country through Aviation.'" Lin Wo will then give a speech, and the words will be omitted for brevity. After the banquet, they took a group photo and dispersed.</p>

<p>Met with Goriva at the Trademark Bureau</p>
<p>The Silk Association Agreed to Send Representatives to Participate</p>
<p>Chen Gongbo, Minister of Industry, inspected the rural areas of North China, traveled from Beijing via Qingdao, Jinan, Tianjin, Pingjin to Dingxian in Hebei, and returned to Beijing. He arrived in Shanghai by overnight train from Beijing yesterday. After getting off the train, he went directly to the Trademark Bureau. At 10:00 AM, he invited Mr. Goriva, an Italian congressman visiting China, to the bureau and talked with him until 11:00 AM before saying goodbye. A reporter from the Guowen News Agency met with Mr. Chen at the bureau yesterday and asked him about the content of the conversation and various industrial matters. According to Mr. Chen, Congressman Goriva came to China to investigate China's silk industry. Today, he met with him because he hopes that China can also send representatives to the Silk Conference to be held in Paris in November. He has agreed to this matter and will send personnel to participate at that time. However, the candidate for representative has not yet been decided. As for the cotton issue in the United States, he knows as much as what is published in the newspapers and has not learned the details. The amount of the National Coal Relief Public Debt is 20 million yuan. Although he has discussed this matter with Minister Song (Ziwen), no method has been determined. Whether it can be realized in the future still depends on the will of the government. He went to North China to inspect the economic situation in the rural areas. He has already given a detailed report at the memorial week of the Central Party Headquarters and will not talk about it again. After the conversation, Mr. Chen hurriedly got into the car and left due to the large amount of business. It is said that Mr. Chen will stay in Shanghai for two or three days before returning to Beijing.</p>

<h3 id="e118">Wang Yansong Suggests Actively Commemorating September 18th <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce has forwarded it to the Central Government</p>
<p>All Sectors Extending Work Hours</p>
<p>Wang Yansong, a Standing Committee member of the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, proposed that the national humiliation of September 18th should be commemorated with an active spirit. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce passed it and forwarded it to the Central Government for review and compliance. The original submission stated, "This is to request that the Central Government be requested to issue an order to the whole country to change all commemorations of the national humiliation of September 18th to an active method in order to achieve practical results. In his reasons, he stated that the number of national humiliation commemorations in our country is almost the highest in the world. Everything in politics, science, economics, agriculture, industry, and commerce is inferior to others, but only the number of national humiliations is the highest. This is truly a great shame and humiliation for our Chinese nation. However, in the past, all national agencies, groups, schools, and factories have not been able to commemorate each national humiliation day in a valuable and meaningful way. On this day, merchants close their stores for one day, workers stop working for one day, students stop studying for one day, and politicians take a day off. Those who commemorate more sincerely also hang half-mast flags to express their condolences and convene a memorial meeting in the morning, thinking that they have done their best to commemorate. They do not know that this kind of commemoration method not only wastes time and squanders time, but also goes against the legacy of perseverance and hard work, making the business of the business community for one day, the work of the factory for one day, and the studies of the students for one day, all thrown into nothingness. This is no different from active suicide. When I speak of this, I cannot help but tremble. Therefore, I hereby propose the following methods: Every year on the anniversary of the September 18th National Humiliation Day, (A) All national agencies and groups, in addition to hanging half-mast flags to express their condolences and holding memorial meetings, shall uniformly extend office hours. (B) All national schools, in addition to hanging half-mast flags to express their condolences and holding memorial meetings, shall uniformly increase teaching time. (C) All national factories, in addition to sounding sirens to express their condolences within the prescribed time, shall uniformly extend working hours. (D) The national business community should take this day as the National Goods Movement Day. In addition to hanging half-mast flags in front of their stores, each store should also post striking slogans promoting national goods to attract widespread attention from the society." After discussion, it was decided to forward the case to the Central Government for adoption. The case has been recorded and is hereby submitted to the Executive Committee of the Central Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang for verification. It is convenient for the public to review it and order compliance.</p>

<p>Since the Central Mint began minting new coins, it has been extremely careful about the tolerance, fineness, and weight of the coins in order to show credibility at home and abroad. Since Dr. Glader, an American consultant, advised the factory, the new coins of the factory were sent to the Philadelphia and San Francisco Mints in the United States for testing. It is said that the testing reports from the two factories have now been sent, and the results are very good. All the new coins are within the legal standard tolerance for fineness. The factory reported in detail to the Ministry of Finance a few days ago, and now it has been ordered to commend the factory and publish the matter in the gazette.</p>
<h3 id="e120">Silk Factory Workers' Attempt to Resume Work Yesterday Failed <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>It Affected Five Factories in the Concession Area</p>
<p>The Trade Union Exhorted Them to Resume Work</p>
<p>According to Xinsheng News Agency, after the female workers of the silk factories in the Zhabei Xinza District went on strike again to oppose the implementation of the quota system, the Social Affairs Bureau mediated in the last few days and set out three measures. Then, both parties were instructed to resume work uniformly yesterday. Unexpectedly, several factories did not sound their sirens, and the workers did not arrive at all the factories. The 21 factories successively resumed their strikes, and five factories, including Taixin in the Concession Area, were also affected. The situation is bad. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e121">Notice to Start Work <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>The Silk Factory Association issued a notice to the factories to start work, stating, "This is to inform you that the representatives of the Association received an order from the Social Affairs Bureau today that the trial implementation of the quota system should be handled by the Bureau. You are hereby ordered to notify all silk factories to start work uniformly tomorrow morning. The Bureau will also send a letter to the Public Security Bureau requesting them to send police to protect the factories." Shanghai Silk Factory Association Committee Chairman Shen Jianchen.</p>
<h3 id="e122">Situation of Starting Work <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>Since the Social Affairs Bureau ordered both parties to resume work uniformly by yesterday, the Sixth District Silk Workers' Union sent supervisors Yuan Yun, Yang Zhi, Hua San Shi, Wu Suzhen, and all the cadres to persuade the workers. At 5:45 AM, the female workers of each factory received a notice from the union and went to work as usual. However, the number of workers was not complete. Each factory also received a notice from the association to start work. However, six factories, including Ganyuan, Xiexin, Xiexing, Hongshengyuanxin on Changan Road, and Ruifeng on Meiyuan Road, did not sound their whistles to start work. Some workers in the remaining factories had already entered the factory to work, but some workers were still waiting to see. Because the workers outside were causing trouble, the factories that started work opened their doors to release the workers. However, Lao Jun said that the factories opened their doors to release the workers because the workers did not go to work in each factory, and there was no trouble. As a result, the resumption of work failed. The Fourth District Public Security Bureau added two police officers to each factory to protect them during the resumption of work. District Chief Lai Gang personally patrolled and inspected the factories.</p>
<h3 id="e123">Successive Strikes <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>There are a total of 21 silk factories in the Zhabei Xinza District. Six factories, including Ganyuan, Xiexin, Xiexing, Hongshengyuanxin on Changan Road, and Ruisheng on Meiyuan Road, did not sound their sirens to start work. Four factories, including Fuxing, Maofeng, Hongchun on Changan Road, and Yuanfengyong on Hengfeng Road, closed their factories and restarted work. Seven factories, including Chujiejiyu, Xieji Zhenxing Yuji on Changan Road, Wuxing on Meiyuan Road, Jiatay on Guangfu Road, and Yuanfengyong on Hengfeng Road, stopped their machines because of insufficient workers or because the workers did not enter the factories. Four factories, including Meifeng on Hengfeng Road, Jiyu Taiji on Gonghe Road, Maitai Jiji Third Factory on Changan Road, and Yuanxing on Yutong Road, continued to start work as usual. After the lunch break, only a few workers went to work, and the striking workers swarmed in the factories again, causing internal workers to be unable to work in peace. Because they were afraid that the workers would crowd people and cause tragedy, each factory took the initiative to stop work and open the doors to release the workers.</p>
<h3 id="e124">Impact on the Concessions <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>When the workers of various factories in Zhabei went on strike yesterday morning, they formed a group at 8 o'clock and attacked the Yu Yuan Silk Factory on Guóqìng Road in the concession area, causing disturbances for a long time. The factory workers, who were working, responded upon hearing the noise and immediately stopped working. Seeing the situation, the factory management knew it was difficult to suppress and immediately opened the gate to let the workers go home. The Yu Yuan workers then went to three factories, including Tai Yuan and Tai Ji, on Avenue Albert, spreading the news, causing the workers of the three factories to go on strike at the same time. The Xiang Yuan Factory on Gansu Road also voluntarily closed down upon hearing the news. As for Yihe on Chengdu Road, it was not affected because it was located further away. Fortunately, no incidents occurred north of the Xinzha Railway and in the Nanshi area.</p>
<h3 id="e125">Union Attitude <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>The silk reeling industry union in the three districts only learned about the incident at 1 p.m. They immediately sent supervisors Yang Shumei, Cui Abao, and others to persuade the workers separately, but it was already too late. At that time, they sent personnel to report to the Party and government organs and notified all factories to sound the whistle for work this morning, waiting for the union to persuade the workers to go to work. Yesterday afternoon, the silk reeling industry union in the six districts issued leaflets to all workers, advising them to return to work, saying, "Dear workers, why are we on strike this time? It is because we oppose the capitalists' changing to the production system. Now we must understand that after the union raised objections to the implementation of the production system, it has been submitted to the higher authorities for handling. The Social Affairs Bureau convened both labor and capital for questioning and decided not to implement it immediately. This problem can now be said to have been completely won. It is still treated as before, with a wage of 50 cents per day and a reward of 20 cents on Sunday for middle and small workers. For the sake of making a living, we should go to work as usual. Do not listen to others' instigation and cause misunderstandings, refusing to go to work. This is absolutely wrong. If you make such unreasonable noise, I am afraid the higher authorities will take action, wouldn't that be detrimental to yourselves? Workers, the union is the guarantee of the workers, it speaks for the workers, and it will never deceive the workers. You can rest assured and quickly go to work tomorrow and work with peace of mind. Continuing to strike day after day will cause you to suffer losses. Don't misunderstand. Now we are still making our own living. After this return to work, we will still be treated according to the previous method of paying wages on a daily basis. Everyone must understand this."</p>
<h3 id="e126">Soap Industry Uses Japanese Hydrogenated Oil <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Sends a Letter Requesting Persuasion to Stop</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Soap Industry Association, saying, "Dear Sirs, on the 5th of this month, we received a letter from the Hunan People's Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association, stating that according to a joint report from soap factories such as Dasheng, Zhengda, Guangming, Jingsheng, and Zheng Guangming in this city, they had previously discovered that the soap shipped from Shanghai and Hankou to Hunan was all made by secretly purchasing Japanese hydrogenated fish oil. At that time, they reported to your association for verification, requesting that the anti-Japanese sub-associations in various counties be notified to pay attention to investigation and that the Shanghai and Hankou chambers of commerce be requested to conduct strict investigation and prohibition to prevent the dumping of enemy goods. Later, it was heard that the Shanghai and Hankou chambers of commerce all replied vaguely, not admitting that there was a situation of using fish oil to make soap, and they were indifferent to it, which is really infuriating. Fortunately, heaven does not hide evil, and a secret letter from the Japanese to various soap factories in Hunan was suddenly found, which was to contact them to secretly purchase fish oil. This is the conclusive proof that the Japanese secretly sell fish oil to Chinese traitors. The letter has been submitted to your association for verification. However, the soap factories in Shanghai and Hankou knowingly know that fish oil is an enemy product, but they secretly cooperate with dealers to make soap. They only want to promote sales and develop, only seeking profit, and completely ignore the fact that the national crisis is still pressing and the national humiliation is very serious. It also affects the promotion of domestic goods and the soap industry in Hunan. These traitors are truly unforgivable. I hereby send another letter requesting your association to conduct a detailed investigation immediately and strictly prohibit it, and also notify the anti-Japanese sub-associations in various counties of this province to conduct a thorough investigation and not allow stores to mistakenly sell it, so as to unite and eliminate enemy goods, which is truly in the public interest. It is found that the report of various soap factories is not false, and the impact on domestic products is indeed significant. It must be strictly investigated and prohibited. Based on the previous situation, a copy of the original document is enclosed and sent to your association. Please verify and reply. As for the intimate friendship, etc., a copy of the letter is attached to the association. It is found that a certain Japanese company is still trying its best to sell Japanese hydrogenated fish oil to soap factories in Hunan Province. Therefore, various soap factories in Shanghai are even more of a place for their attention. It is difficult to guarantee that there are no members of your association who are tempted by them. I hereby enclose a copy of the letter. I hope your association will secretly investigate whether any of your members privately use Japanese hydrogenated fish oil as raw material, and give a factual reply. At the same time, take measures to prevent it and earnestly persuade them to stop. This is our sincere hope."</p>
<h3 id="e127">Overseas Chinese General Association Requests Restoration <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, a Request was Submitted to the Social Affairs Bureau for Approval and Reorganization</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese in Mexico and Japanese Overseas Chinese Telegraphically Request Maintenance</p>
<p>Since its establishment, the Global Overseas Chinese General Association in this city has been able to do its best to maintain the interests of overseas Chinese at home and abroad. Recently, it was ordered to close down and stop activities by the authorities for publishing newspaper advertisements to raise donations to aid the Mexican refugees who were expelled and returned to China. Now it is learned that the association, in order to maintain the interests of overseas Chinese, specially submitted a request to the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday to forward it to the municipal government, requesting the Executive Yuan to comply with the feelings of the overseas Chinese and approve the filing so that it can continue to proceed. It is also learned that the Japanese Overseas Chinese Deportation Group and the Mexican Refugee Maintenance Association telegraphed Chairman Chiang of the Military Commission yesterday, requesting that he grant maintenance. The details of each situation are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e128">Request for Filing and Approval for Reorganization <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the association submitted a request to the Social Affairs Bureau, saying, "The request is to reply to the order to temporarily suspend activities and to earnestly request the government to comply with the feelings of the overseas Chinese and approve the filing so that it can continue to proceed and reassure the overseas Chinese. We received an order from your bureau, No. She Zi 14181, stating that the association had organized itself without permission from the municipal party department and had not reported to the competent authorities for approval and filing. It had also published advertisements to receive donations before being approved, which is not only prone to abuses but also violates laws and regulations. Now we have received an order from the municipal government, which has been forwarded by the Executive Yuan, to strictly ban it, etc. We have ordered the association to immediately stop activities, separately end them, and report for verification. Do not delay, etc. After receiving the order, we were terrified. The association is organized by more than 800 pure elements of overseas Chinese. Its purpose is to promote mutual assistance, connect the feelings of overseas Chinese, and maintain their interests. There is no other political background. All kinds of facilities have been seen by people in the past year. The Chinese Chamber of Commerce in Surabaya and the Chinese Chamber of Commerce in Vietnam have successively joined as initiating groups. Domestic celebrities such as Xiong Xiling, Xu Shiying, and Wu Ziyu, party and state figures such as Chu Minyi, Luo Wengan, and Chen Gongbo, central committee members such as Zeng Zhongming, Ge Baichuan, Fang Jue, and Wu Xingya, Pan Gongzhan, and other gentlemen from the Shanghai Municipal Party Department Committee are also listed as adults who have participated. It can be seen that the establishment of the association is not only for all our overseas Chinese, but also due to environmental pressure and the needs of the times, and also the same sympathy and request of national leaders. This time, the Executive Yuan suddenly issued a strict order to ban it, which is really unexpected. However, the reasons for the ban are nothing more than the following two points: (1) It was organized without permission from the municipal party department to report to the competent authorities for filing; (2) It also published advertisements to receive donations without reporting for approval. Now the responsible colleagues of the association will make a sincere defense of the above two points and respectfully state them to your bureau first. (1) Our overseas Chinese, in view of the discrimination and abuse suffered by foreigners in recent years, such as the recent anti-Chinese in Mexico and the oppression of Chinese businessmen in Southeast Asia, have been extremely cruel and have never been seen before. The deeper the stimulation, the more the Chinese government is unable to protect it due to environmental relations. For the sake of their own interests, our overseas Chinese compatriots are forced to contact various comrades and initiate the organization of this association in order to concentrate the spirit and strength of all overseas Chinese under the leadership of the government and to precede the self-salvation movement. At the beginning of the initiation (October 7 last year), they had already reported to the local highest party department according to law, requesting permission to establish it. However, the Shanghai Municipal Party Department showed that they were not allowed to do so. They did not know the reason, but they were eager to save themselves and could not give up the public opinion of the majority of overseas Chinese. Therefore, they insisted on the freedom of association and association under the Constitution of the Republic of China and resolutely proceeded with the organization. After the establishment, they again requested filing from the Central Party Department, the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, the Shanghai Municipal Government, and the Municipal Party Department on June 5, 6, and 29 of this year, respectively. It is the colleagues of the association who have extremely respected the laws and regulations of the government. The reason why it has not been approved so far seems to be the fault of the association. (2) This time, in the anti-Chinese incident in Mexico, tens of thousands of our overseas Chinese compatriots in Mexico were robbed and massacred, and their situation was extremely tragic. Fortunately, they escaped from the tiger's mouth, escaped into the United States, and were expelled and returned to China. They fled in a hurry, and their food and clothing were cut off. After arriving in Shanghai, they had no home to return to, and various domestic mass organizations and charitable organizations seemed to be indifferent. The anti-Chinese trend in Mexico has lasted for two years, and no one in the motherland has provided relief, which is really heartbreaking. The association is a service organization for overseas Chinese. Seeing the above situation, it is difficult to sit idly by. Moreover, with the masses dying and the opportunity pressing, it is even more impossible to submit a request and wait for approval for a long time before acting. Therefore, in the spirit of sacrificing, rescuing, and helping each other, an emergency donation was initiated, only to be helpful. Since compatriots freely donate private property to save the lives of compatriots, who would worry about the obstruction of the government? Moreover, the donations are entrusted to banks for collection, and the finances can be shown to be open. Therefore, Chairman Chiang and the Central Relief Committee each assisted with huge amounts of money. Even your bureau's fourth second material also repeatedly requested the association to provide relief. The colleagues' initiation of relief for refugees has long been praised by the authorities, and the government leaders have done their best to assist. It does not seem to be a private act. The above two points, right and wrong, are subject to public opinion. The government and the party department both have the absolute responsibility to guide and train the people to organize groups. If it is believed that the association has any improper procedures or measures, it can be corrected by means of orders. If this kind of procedure has not been followed and a strict order to stop it is suddenly issued, or even an order to end it, it does not seem to be the intention to respect public opinion and cultivate mass organizations, and it is far from the government's intention to love and protect overseas Chinese. However, the colleagues of the association have always obeyed the government and supported the party and the country. Now that they have received a clear order to ban it, they should abide by it and immediately suspend all activities, waiting for the government to deal with it fairly and guide its implementation. As for the part of the order to end it separately, the public opinion of all overseas Chinese compatriots is really uneasy. Although the association was established for a short time, it has a considerable understanding in the society, and overseas Chinese all over the world have deep sympathy. If it is suddenly cancelled, not only will all overseas Chinese be greatly disappointed, but also the public will be suspicious of the government's cruelty to overseas Chinese groups. It is a pity that the existence of the association itself is sufficient, and the credibility of our government's three orders and five declarations to love and protect overseas Chinese over the years will be completely lost. As for how to improve the organization of the association and how to make the work legal, it all depends on the government's guidance and promotion or order to reorganize it. The colleagues will definitely follow it unanimously, and strive to make the Global Overseas Chinese General Association legally produced under the principle of practicing the Three People's Principles. Then, tens of millions of overseas Chinese all over the world will definitely praise the benevolence and virtue of our government. We respectfully request your bureau to consider the small labor of overseas Chinese who sacrifice for the country, and immediately find a way to provide relief, and forward it to the municipal government, and submit it to the Executive Yuan for review, and bestow maintenance so that the association can continue to handle overseas Chinese mutual assistance undertakings, so as to comfort the public's hope, and there is no gratitude, and still wait for instructions and orders to comply. Sincerely, Wu, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, Standing Committee Member of the Global Overseas Chinese General Association, Wu Chengyu, Yan Dajue, Chen Daming, Wu Ziyuan Kong Gongwei.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the Mexican Refugee Maintenance Association issued a telegram, saying, "Lushan presented to Chairman Chiang, President Wang, Mayor Wu, and your inspection, the Global Overseas Chinese General Association is a group organized by tens of thousands of overseas Chinese, and its purpose is upright. Since its establishment a year ago, all kinds of facilities have been seen by people, and although it was established for a short time, it cares about the suffering of overseas Chinese first. Previously, it was banned by the authorities for initiating relief for Mexican refugees, but it has accepted the order and is preparing to reorganize. Its obedience to the government is evident. Recently, it was heard that the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission has also asked the Executive Yuan to order its dissolution, but it is not clear what is going on. It is found that the association is not a reactionary organization, and there is no reason to dissolve it. If it is destroyed, it is feared that it will arouse the public anger of all overseas Chinese and cause suspicion among the public. The colleagues share weal and woe and feel injustice. Therefore, we telegraphed to you to bestow maintenance to comfort the overseas Chinese and reassure the people. Huang Zhulin, Chairman of the Shanghai Mexican Refugee Maintenance Association, and all the refugees respectfully kowtow, Yu Yin.</p>

In addition to paying a considerable amount of cash as a guarantee and a substantial shop guarantee, they must also be introduced by acquaintances. From May 16 of this year, the guarantee money has been successively collected, and the appointment letters have been issued to Deputy Regiment Commander Cao He, Jin Yushan, Adjutant Xu Zhiquan, Sheng Wenhua, Sheng Xu, Zhang Zhiren, Chen Zhengyu, Quartermaster Lu Yinghua, Zhao Zhensheng, Zhang Jun, Service Member Yang Zhiping, Clerk Yan Shouzhang, etc. The military uniforms and armed belts are all handled by He Shaohua on behalf of the applicants. If they travel to and from other places, passports are issued in the name of the Fake Brigade Commander Zeng Yingliang.</p>

<p>The first regiment commander of the Fake Brigade Command, He Shaohua, carried this passport with him and often traveled between Henan and the Beijing-Shanghai railway line with two orderlies. This matter was learned by the Commander of the Railway Protection Military Police, who immediately ordered Fang Dixia, the first captain of the sixth regiment of the department, to order the railway protection military police under his command to pay close attention and investigate and arrest him. After receiving the order, Fang immediately investigated and found Lu Yinghua, the fake quartermaster, in the first-class car of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway the day before yesterday. He interrogated him, and according to the answer, after being appointed this time, he took the train from Changzhou, carrying 200 yuan, and planned to go to the residence of the regimental commander He Shaohua in the French Concession of Shanghai to pay the guarantee money and find a money shop as a guarantee, and then ask the Minister of Finance.</p>
<h3 id="e136">Minister Song Ziwen <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>To add the appointment, the military police of the team followed Lu Si's car to the North Station in Shanghai, and the fake regimental commander He Shaohua had already arrived at the station to greet him. Therefore, He and Lu, the two criminals, were arrested and taken to the team headquarters for detention and interrogation. Luo Gengtang, a service member of the team headquarters, was also sent to the Municipal Public Security Bureau with a document to report to Director Wen Hongen, and was allowed to send personnel to cooperate in the arrest of the fugitive Chang Chung officers, so as to handle the case together. After receiving the report, Director Wen immediately ordered Lu Ying, the captain of the investigation team of the bureau, to send experienced detectives, Gao Juchuan, to conduct a strict investigation as soon as possible. The investigation team found out on the afternoon of the day before yesterday that the fake military agency was set up at No. 107, 4th Floor, Baer Road, the home of the fake regimental commander He Shaohua. He reported to Captain Lu, who immediately sent detectives Shen Jinchu and others to join Chinese and foreign detectives from the French Concession Patrol Room. At about 5 o'clock, they arrested the fake adjutant Xu Zhiquan and the suspect Xie Zhenting. They found an appointment letter book with 26 copies, the official seal of the regimental commander, nine official seals of various kinds, letter paper and letter shells, passport symbols.</p>
<h3 id="e137">Appointment Letter Stub <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>Four blue cloth military uniforms, three military trousers, and overcoats, and several photos taken by fake military officers were taken to the French Patrol Room for detention. Captain Lu personally negotiated with Salih (transliteration), the director of the French Political Department, and reached a compromise. At 12 noon yesterday, the original team of detectives, including Gao, was sent to bring the suspects and evidence back to the team for interrogation. Xu Zhiquan confessed that he was 39 years old, from Taizhou, and lived in Songjiazhai, north of Caojiadu. He had served as a detective in the third team of the first district of the water police force. He was introduced by Yan Shouzhang, the clerk of the regiment headquarters, and received it at 8 pm on the 5th of this month.</p>

<p>One paper, one symbol, until he was arrested, he knew that he had been fooled and asked for leniency. According to Xie Zhenting's confession, he was 39 years old, from Caojiadu. He was arrested at the door for looking for a swallow's nest and did not know anything else. After the interrogation, the two criminals were detained. It is reported that the military police team prepared a document and went to the office to transfer the suspects to Director Wen. Wen would not allow them to be taken back for handling until the official document from the military police regimental commander arrived at the office. The fake brigade commander is now at large and wanted.</p>
<h3 id="e139">After the Huge Amount of Money Was Stolen from the New Ning Shao Company, the Company Strictly Prohibits Private Transportation <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>In order to avoid unfortunate disasters and the lives and property of the entire ship, the case of the New Ning Shao ship of the Ning Shao Company being stolen a huge amount of money has been recorded in this newspaper. Now the continuing news will be recorded as follows.</p>
<h3 id="e140">The Thief Premeditated <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>The occurrence of this case is very strange. The boatman Wei Yuming brought money on behalf of the bank, and even the company did not know about it. The thief disguised himself as a wealthy guest and boarded the New Ning Shao ship in October of last year. After arriving on the ship, he specified that he wanted the No. 12 official cabin and did not allow anyone else to share the room with him. Therefore, he brought an servant with him, and sometimes he voluntarily lived in the room alone and bought two ship tickets so that he could refuse others to share the room with him. He also told Wei Yuming that he liked to go to bed early, and after entering the room alone, he forbade others to make noise there. His deep intentions and secret intentions had already been planned several months ago.</p>
<h3 id="e141">Thoroughly Investigate the Boatman's Behavior <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>After the Kenye Bank reported to the police station, it immediately sent detectives to the Ning Shao Company to investigate Wei Yuming's behavior and the guarantor after boarding the ship. The shipping company told them that Wei was guaranteed by Zhang, the deputy manager of the Minghua Bank, and had always been very reliable. The detectives also went to the guarantor to inquire and also proved that Wei was quite pure and wealthy. This case can prove that there is absolutely no relationship with him. Therefore, the police station only prepared to question the boatman, and the treatment was quite preferential. The boatman's insurance policy stated that fire and theft were not the responsibility, only guaranteeing his escape.</p>
<h3 id="e142">Tracking Down the Thief's Whereabouts <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>The thief's whereabouts are still unknown. According to boatman Wei Yuming, the guest had been on the ship for ten months, and went back and forth about two or three times a month. Each time, for example, for a 6-yuan cabin, the wine money would be given 14 yuan. The person once said that he was familiar with a friend in the Yuchang Coal Company. Now this friend is no longer in Yuchang in Shanghai, but has gone to Hangzhou to do business. Yesterday, it was heard that Shanghai has sent personnel to Hangzhou to inquire about this friend, hoping to investigate the whereabouts of this thief.</p>
<h3 id="e143">The Company Prohibits Bringing Money <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the company was very angry when it heard about this matter. Because of the recent unrest at sea, the New Ning Shao ship refused to load cash for various banks in order to ensure safe sailing. The boatman secretly collected rewards and transported huge amounts of money on behalf of others, which not only violated the company's regulations, but also was close to stealing water feet. The impact of this was enough to cause greater danger to the ship, which was related to the lives and property of the entire ship. Therefore, yesterday, he specially sent a letter to the ship owner and the first and second mates, saying that the prohibition of boatmen from privately transporting money on behalf of others had been repeatedly warned, but the boatman dared to despise and resist it, which was really hateful. From now on, the ship owner and the first and second mates will be responsible for checking carefully when the ship is opened. If there are any private transportation of large amounts of money and banknotes, in addition to reporting to the company to severely punish the money-transporting person, the money will be immediately returned to the original sender before the ship can be opened. At the same time, a letter was sent to various banks, telling them not to take the risk of entrusting boatmen to transport money, causing other misfortunes. If there are any of the above-mentioned situations in the future, in case of an accident, the money-sending bank must bear full responsibility.</p>
<h3 id="e144">The Shipping Bureau is Not Responsible for Storms and Water Stains on Passenger and Cargo Ships <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>During this hurricane, many merchant ships in Shanghai encountered storms and were in danger, and many suffered losses. However, because they had received warnings from the Observatory in advance, they were able to take precautions in advance. Therefore, no ships were lost. Those who were delayed due to sheltering from the wind will be able to make up for their flights and leave the port one after another until tomorrow. Fortunately, the docks of the China Merchants Bureau took precautions to block the water early, and the passengers and goods in the stacks were not damaged. However, some of the goods stored on the dock were damaged by the high tide because they could not be moved to the stacks in time. The passengers have negotiated with the bureau. Also, the Shunlun ship, which was going to Xiamen, received a warning on the way and immediately sheltered from the wind. As a result, the hull was still hit by the wind and waves, and the 400 pieces of bran loaded on the deck were completely wetted by the sea water and waves, causing huge losses. Because the passengers voluntarily loaded the goods on the deck, the shipping company is not responsible for anything.</p>

<p>The main murderer, Bartolomeu Remedios, confessed to killing Zhang Cailian without denying it. At first, the accomplice, Joao Remedios, refused to confess to participating in the murder and transporting the corpse to the port. The Consul General used various human witnesses, material evidence, etc. to confront him, and the accomplice, Joao, finally lowered his head and was speechless. He directly admitted that he helped his younger brother put Zhang Cailian's body in a trunk and moved it to the Huishan Wharf and sent it to the Shanghai Maru, hoping to transport it to Japan, shift the attention of this case to other places, and try to cover up the traces of the murder. After the confessions of the two criminals, Dr. Xue Erfo, the Portuguese Consul General, ordered them to be sent to Macau and returned to the formal court for trial.</p>
<h3 id="e147">All Material Evidence Prepared <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>

Moreover, regarding the various facts related to proving that the two defendants committed murder and moved the corpse, the testimonies of all witnesses who appeared in court have been recorded by the Consulate, along with the two defendants' confessions of the brutal murder and moving of the corpse, as well as signed statements, etc., all have been collected and are within the case file. It has been sent to the Macau court. The Portuguese Consul has also submitted a complete written report on the entire case from beginning to end, and it will be submitted at the same time when the two defendants are escorted to Macau. Furthermore, a telegram was sent to Macau in advance, reporting that the escort will depart from Shanghai tomorrow.</p>

<p>Nanjing woman Tao Yuzhi suffered the most serious injuries. At the Yongyuan Dyeing and Weaving Factory at No. 20 Weiwu Branch Road, under the jurisdiction of the Second District General Office of the Nanshi Public Security Bureau, the scale is very large and there are many workers. Chen Weigan, a worker from Zhenjiang, 33 years old, hired a rickshaw at 7:15 last night and carried a number of bamboo poles, passing in front of the factory gate. Unexpectedly, just as he reached the Jiadeli intersection, a bomb suddenly exploded by the roadside, with a shattering sound that shook the surrounding area. At that time, Chen, the rickshaw puller, and people at the alley entrance, a total of seven men and women, were injured. Chen himself suffered injuries to his head and legs. Dong Cungen, 32 years old, from Hangzhou, was injured in both legs. Chuan Lianrong, 33 years old, from Hangzhou, who runs a cigarette and paper shop at No. 43 on the road, was injured in his right leg. The child Li Genrong, 8 years old, a local, who lives at No. 43 Jiadeli, was injured in both feet. The woman Chen, 41 years old, from Ningbo, was injured in her left leg. The rickshaw puller Huang Jinfu, 23 years old, from Yancheng, who lives at No. 28 Yuanxingli, Nanshi Wharf, was injured in both legs and abdomen. Su Yulin, 33 years old, from Sichuan, who lives at No. 5 Gongxingfang on the same road, was injured in his buttocks and left foot. The most seriously injured was Tao Yuzhi, a 19-year-old Nanjing woman who runs a boiler shop at No. 19 on the road, who was injured in her left leg.

They saw the injured groaning on the ground and immediately took them to the Shanghai Hospital, and reported to District Chief Li, who reported to the General Bureau for investigation.</p>
<h3 id="e150">Public Works Bureau Begins Collecting New Land Tax After Reassessing Land Values <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>Because land values have increased, an 80% discount is allowed, limited to September 30th for payment. The Public Works Bureau of the Public Concession of Shanghai believes that land values within the concession have increased rapidly in recent years. Therefore, since 1920, a reassessment has been conducted every two to three years. The previous land value assessment was determined in the autumn of 1930 and implemented on New Year's Day 1931. Subsequently, in 1932, the reassessment had already been authorized by the taxpayers, but due to the emergency situation in the area, the Public Works Bureau decided to postpone it to 1933. The new land value assessment was approved in the budget of the current year's taxpayers' meeting and implemented on July 1, 1933. The new land value assessment has long been published in the Public Works Bureau Gazette, and the land tax notices based on the new assessment have also been prepared and will be issued within days. However, the Public Works Bureau is aware that although the new land value assessment is very accurate and fair, there are still many places where the previous assessment was too low, resulting in the new assessment value appearing to be significantly increased. Due to these special circumstances, it has been decided to reduce the increased portion of the land tax payable by registered landowners in the second half of 1933 by 20%, but only if the landowners pay before September 30th. Those who pay after the deadline will still have to pay the full amount. Anyone wishing to apply for a tax reduction can go to the Donations Office at No. 209 Jiangxi Road to obtain a reporting form to fill out.</p>
<h3 id="e151">Ministry of Finance Approves Tax Reduction for Re-exported Used Gunny Sacks by Chamber of Commerce <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>Tax of $0.39 per picul and exemption from surtax. The City Chamber of Commerce previously submitted a request to the Ministry of Finance for an exemption from tax on used sacks, which has been reported in various newspapers. It is now known that the Ministry of Finance has approved the Chamber's request yesterday, approving a tax reduction. The original text is recorded below: "Received and noted. The gunny sack item is listed as a taxable item in both the import and export tariff regulations. The request in the submitted report to use the example of empty containers to exempt used gunny sacks transferred within the customs from transit tax is inconsistent with the provisions of the tariff regulations. However, the statement that the valuation and taxation of used gunny sacks involves cumbersome procedures is indeed true. In order to show compassion for the difficulties of businesses and for the sake of providing relief, all used gunny sacks transferred domestically should be subject to a tax of $0.39 in national currency per picul, and exempt from surtax. This method not only simplifies tax procedures, but compared to the original ad valorem taxation, which totaled $0.90 in national currency per picul, is already a significant reduction. In addition to ordering the Inspector General of Customs to comply, it is hereby approved for notification. This approval."</p>
<h3 id="e152">International Trade Bureau Convenes Fruit Merchants Meeting Again Yesterday <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>Decision to first try selling chestnuts and gingko nuts</p>
<p>The International Trade Bureau of this city, in order to develop foreign trade in Chinese fruits, has repeatedly convened various fruit merchants to discuss ways to open up overseas markets. Since the news was released, it has attracted the attention of British fruit merchants, who have inquired about the details from our consulate in Liverpool. The Trade Bureau convened fruit merchants again yesterday to discuss the methods, which are recorded below:</p>
<h3 id="e153">Discussion Methods <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>The Guidance Department of the International Trade Bureau convened various fruit merchants yesterday to continue discussing methods for promoting overseas trade. Xu Yunqing of Dongshenglong, Cheng Kongshi of Huitai, Zhu Suda of Xie Mao, etc., attended. As a result of the discussion, it was decided to first prepare samples, print promotional materials, and distribute them to various sectors of the country. The goods to be promoted will first be the less perishable gingko nuts and chestnuts, and efforts will be made to sell them on a trial basis. Then, the quantity will be gradually increased and shipped directly overseas for sale.</p>
<h3 id="e154">Difficulties in Promotion <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>According to Mr. Zhang of the Guidance Department of the International Trade Bureau, there are approximately three difficulties in promoting Chinese fruits to foreign countries: (1) The shipping cost is too high. Each box of approximately 60 catties of fruit requires a shipping fee of $7.50, plus a tax of $2, and the extra cost is nearly $10. It is difficult to predict whether the future profits will be able to make up for this amount. (2) The fruits produced in various places this year have suffered from insect pests, and there are very few good ones, making it difficult to compete abroad. (3) Recently, in order to promote domestic products, the Soviet Union has vigorously prohibited the import of foreign goods. Our country exports 10,000 dan of fruit to Russia every year. After this, it will be impossible to sell, which is a major blow to our country's fruit industry.</p>

<h3 id="e158">Award of English and American Reduction Dispute <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>Formally published by the Municipal Government yesterday. The workers of the British American Tobacco Company in this city previously had a dispute due to the employer reducing work, which was mediated by the authorities and was later resolved. However, the employer could not agree on the issue of wages for the period of the slowdown, which led to another slowdown. The Municipal Government submitted it to the arbitration committee for arbitration. On the 5th and 6th, the members unanimously agreed to the following award:</p>
<p>Award of the Shanghai Municipal Labor-Management Arbitration Committee (Disputing Parties): Labor Party: Shanghai Fourth District Cigarette Industry Workers' Union, No. 8 Sanleli, Beikai'er Road, Hongkou; Shanghai Fifth District Cigarette Industry Workers' Union, No. 78 Pudong Ni Du Main Street; Employer: British American Tobacco Company, No. 6 Suzhou Road; The above parties have a dispute due to reduced work. After mediation, the employer did not agree to the labor party's request for wages during the slowdown period, and the mediation failed. The Social Bureau requested the Municipal Government to submit it to arbitration. A special award is made as follows: (Main Text) The request of the workers of the First and Second Factories for wages during the slowdown period, except for the workers of the Second Factory's leaf room who voluntarily slowed down, should be rejected. The remaining workers who were refused work by the factory due to the impact of the slowdown should be paid wages by the factory for the period of work stoppage. The request of the workers of the Third Factory for wages during the slowdown period should be rejected. (Facts and Reasons) The employer has the First (Old Factory) and Second (New Factory) factories in Pudong, and the Third Factory on Taopeng Road in the Concession of this city. In May of this year, the original six days of work per week were reduced to five days, then from five to four days, and then from four to three days. The labor party believed that the workers' wages were calculated by the hour and day, and it was difficult to maintain their livelihood with only three days of work per week. They requested the employer to provide at least four days of work per week, but the employer refused, which led to the dispute. The Third Factory on Taopeng Road started to slow down at 9:00 AM on May 10. In the afternoon of the same day, more than 200 workers from the Third Factory went to the First and Second Factories in Pudong, demanding that the workers of the two factories slow down together. The workers of the Second Factory's leaf room expressed sympathy and slowed down at 7:30 AM on the 11th, and the dispute continued to escalate. Then the employer refused the workers of each factory to work. After the Social Bureau convened a mediation meeting and decided on the number of working days per week, the workers of each factory were able to resume work uniformly on May 18. According to statistics, the First and Second Factories slowed down or stopped work for two days, and the Third Factory slowed down for three days. The committee convened representatives of both labor and management parties for questioning. According to the labor party representative, the reasons for requesting the employer to pay wages during the slowdown period were: (1) The factory reduced work without the approval of the government, so the factory should be responsible for the dispute. (2) The workers' failure to work was either due to the factory's order to stop, or being driven away by the factory, or because the factory was closed and the workers could not enter the factory, so the factory should also be responsible for the work stoppage. (3) Some workers still worked as usual during the above reduced working hours, so they should be paid wages as usual, and although the factory regulations had provisions for shortening working hours, the workers had already expressed disagreement, etc. After consulting the employer's representative, they stated that the labor party's strike was unreasonable and wages could not be paid. The reasons were that the company had reduced work due to the many incidents in North China, reduced orders from various places, and stalled sales, and the losses suffered were greater than those of the labor party. Moreover, the factory regulations formulated by the factory had already been submitted to the Municipal Social Bureau for record, and Article 6 of the regulations stipulated (omitted above) that if the factory shortened working hours, it could also pay wages according to the workers' working hours. The factory could decide to shorten working hours on its own without having to report to the government for approval in advance. Before going through mediation or arbitration procedures, workers who went on strike without authorization violated Article 23 of the Trade Union Law. Disputes between labor and management cannot be declared a strike unless they have gone through mediation and arbitration procedures and have been approved by a secret ballot of more than two-thirds of all members at the members' meeting. Also, in view of the company's consideration for the workers during the workers' past strikes, although it has repeatedly paid wages during the strike period, the results have not won the workers' favor, but have led to the workers' arbitrary strikes. Therefore, strike wages will not be paid this time, etc. After the committee checked the original file of the mediation meeting and reviewed the statements of the representatives of both parties, it recognized that the factory regulations formulated by the employer had been submitted to the Social Bureau for approval and record. Although the labor party had expressed disagreement with the factory regulations, before they had been revised, these factory regulations were effective. The factory had provisions for shortening working hours, and the workers slowed down without authorization because they could not maintain their livelihood with three days of work per week, and their behavior was indeed in conflict with the Trade Union Law. Therefore, the Third Factory's workers' initial voluntary slowdown was not in accordance with the request to pay slowdown wages and should be rejected. The workers of the Second Factory's leaf room supported the Third Factory's voluntary slowdown, causing the dispute to escalate, and the employer did not need to pay wages for the period of slowdown. However, in the First and Second Factories, except for the Second Factory's leaf room, the remaining workers who were refused work by the factory due to the impact of the slowdown should be paid wages by the factory for the period of work stoppage to clarify responsibility. The case was unanimously agreed by all members of the committee and was considered fair. The award is made as in the main text. September, the 22nd year of the Republic of China.

Yesterday, Huang Renzhi, Zhang Bochu, and other Shanghai-based gentry from Chuansha invited fellow villagers to discuss relief methods at the Juelin Temple. It is reported that the Pudong Fellow Provincial Association will convene a temporary emergency meeting of all directors and supervisors at the Jiangxi Road meeting place at 6:00 PM today to prepare for emergency relief.

The relief efforts in Chuansha will certainly be even more enthusiastic. The Xin Xin News Agency reported that Li Leng, the county magistrate of Chuansha and chairman of the disaster relief association, telegraphed various charitable organizations in Shanghai, including Chinese and foreign relief organizations, for disaster relief due to the typhoon and surge on Hengsha Island in the county.

<p>The China National Lichiaoi United Association telegraphed to all Lichiaoi associations in the four northeastern provinces yesterday: "To all Lichiaoi associations in Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, and Rehe, please note that the purpose of our founder's establishment of Lichiaoi is to seek national freedom and equality. Its means are not smoking or drinking, and its slogan is to destroy the Qing with one heart. Unfortunately, after the abdication of the Manchus, on September 18th of the 20th year of the Republic of China, the Japanese created chaos in the eastern provinces and manufactured the puppet state of Manchuria. Our Lichiaoi people are extremely saddened. On the 5th of this month, Reuters telegraphed from Dalian that the Japanese intend to use our 2 million fellow villagers in the Northeast. We are extremely indignant and specially telegraphed to ask you to pay attention to our Lichiaoi slogan and not be fooled by the Japanese, so as not to shame the world and future generations. Looking at the Northeast, tears fill our eyes. We hope you will take note. Zhang Yichen, Chairman of the China National Lichiaoi United Association."</p>

<h3 id="e166">Chinese and Foreign Relief Society Receives Disaster Reports from Various Places <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese and Foreign Relief Society sent Commissioner Zheng Jishoucheng to conduct an on-site investigation of the breach of the Yellow River. The disaster situation in Lanfeng has been reported in yesterday's newspaper. Now, according to the report of the investigation in Kaocheng County, they went to inspect the inside and outside of the city together on the morning of the 4th of this month. The tragic situation was truly unbearable to look at. Only the areas near the city and the city itself were completely submerged. The county office has been moved to Hejiazhuang, about five miles outside the South Gate. The houses washed down by the water accounted for 80% or 90%. The bricks, wood, tiles, and debris still covered the shops in the disaster area. Various items and crushed livestock were also among them. The stench along the way was unbearable to smell. The investigation form attached to the county stated that the Yellow River breached a mouth 170 steps wide from the Xin Nan section, eight miles west of the city. The number of deaths was approximately 30 in the first district and 20 in the second district. The mud was knee-deep, making it difficult to investigate and difficult to obtain an accurate number. More than 3,000 mu of farmland were flooded, and more than 700 head of livestock were drowned. The loss was mainly to the people's food. The area affected by the flood accounted for more than 80% of the first and second districts, with more than 50,000 rooms collapsing. The number of disaster victims was no less than 30,000. The high ground was all sand and mud, and the low-lying areas were still three feet deep in water. Most of the people escaped to the top of the levee, where they were exposed to the wind and ate in the open. Some were also begging in other places, which was truly a great disaster.</p>
<p>It was also reported that the society had recently received reports of typhoon and surge disasters in Chuansha and Baoshan, near Shanghai, which are recorded below: (1) Li, the county magistrate of Chuansha and chairman of the relief association, telegraphed, "Hengsha Island in our county has suffered a typhoon disaster in winter, with fields and houses swept away, and countless deaths. The disaster victims are homeless, without clothes or food, and the situation is extremely tragic and awaits relief. Please provide immediate relief." (2) Jin, the county magistrate of Baoshan, telegraphed, "During the hurricane on the 2nd night, the sea surge washed away 60% of Changxing and other five sands, drowning 50 to 60 sand people. The dikes and seedlings were completely destroyed. Please assist with relief." The society received a flurry of disaster reports from various places, all of which were urgent. Those in charge were distressed by the need for extensive relief efforts, which were difficult to raise funds for. They were pacing around the room, unable to sleep or eat peacefully. They urgently hoped that all sectors would quickly contribute to the cause. Those who wished to donate could send them directly to the society at No. 12 Renji Road.</p>

<p>The China Jisheng Society recently received letters from Mr. Gu Danchao of the Wusong Lifesaving Bureau and Mr. Wang Youyi of the Wusong Branch, reporting that Laoshu Sha on the opposite bank of Wusong suffered a tragic hurricane and flood disaster. More than 500 houses were submerged, and more than 3,000 disaster victims were displaced. More than 600 people were drowned, and the bodies drifted into the sea or washed up on the beach. A total of approximately 1,000 disaster victims were killed in Chuansha and Wusong. The situation was extremely tragic, with the water depth on the flat ground still two or three feet, which has not yet receded. Thousands of disaster victims were waiting to be fed. Please send personnel to investigate and provide relief. After checking the previous reports on this hurricane and flood disaster, a flurry of telegrams have reported that Chuansha has been severely affected. In addition to the society sending personnel to investigate, which has been reported in the previous newspaper, yesterday morning, Li Yunmen was sent to accompany several relief workers to Laoshu Sha on the opposite bank of Wusong for on-site investigation. 150 shi of relief rice was purchased locally in Wusong and distributed first for emergency relief. However, the society's relief funds are extremely scarce, and the amount of relief rice purchased is too small to be of any use. Shanghai, as a prosperous and important area, has suffered such a terrible disaster. The people of Shanghai are all in danger. It is impossible to know what the disasters in the other provinces are. It is hoped that charitable comrades at home and abroad will help each other to save this urgent crisis. Saving people is saving yourself, and the merit is immeasurable.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Municipal Public Safety and Health Bureaus issued instructions to various domestic servant employment agencies, stating: Regarding compliance matters, it has been found that in the city streets, male and female domestic servants employed by residents often indiscriminately dump garbage and sewage on the streets.

<h3 id="e172">Chinese Ships Should be Repaired and Manufactured at the Jiangnan Shipbuilding Factory <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>Order from the Executive Yuan</p>
<p>The Jiangnan Shipbuilding Factory is a large-scale shipyard operated by our country that can handle the construction of warships and ships. The Ministry of the Navy, in order to expand the factory's operations and save the state-run shipping industry, has specifically requested the Central Government to order all domestic shipping companies to have Chinese ships built in Chinese factories in order to reclaim lost rights and protect future rights. The original order is copied below. To Whom It May Concern: We have recently received Order No. 4530 from the Ministry of Communications, stating: We have received Secret Order No. 3952 from the Executive Yuan, stating: In response to a report from the Ministry of the Navy, one of the reports humbly requests the Ministry of Communications to issue a circular to domestic shipping companies to have ships repaired and manufactured by the Navy's Jiangnan Shipbuilding Factory in order to reclaim rights. According to the report from the Navy's Jiangnan Shipbuilding Factory, the factory can repair and manufacture ships for shipping companies in addition to naval vessels, in order to assist the development of the domestic shipping industry. Domestic shipbuilding organizations have consistently regarded this factory as the one with the most work. In recent years, foreign-operated shipyards in China have sprung up one after another, seizing opportunities to profit. Not only do foreign ships coming to China favor their own kind and flock to those yards, but the majority of the repair and manufacturing projects for Chinese ships are also contracted out to them. As a result, rights and profits flow outward, and there is no way to stop the leak. This not only greatly harms the country's economy, but also causes China's only shipbuilding organization to be squeezed out by foreigners, leaving it with no opportunity to revive and losing the original intention of saving the country through industry. We humbly request that the Executive Yuan, after carefully considering the situation, approve the request and order the Ministry of Communications to issue a circular to all maritime affairs bureaus, shipping associations, and shipping companies to pay attention to the domestic shipbuilding industry and to have all ship repairs and manufacturing projects contracted to the Jiangnan Shipbuilding Factory in order to reclaim lost rights and promote future industries. The benefits to the future of the Party and the country will be significant. Based on the aforementioned report, the matter should be prepared in writing and submitted for review and implementation, and an order has already been issued to comply. Therefore, an order is hereby issued for the Ministry to relay the order to all shipping companies for compliance. This order is hereby issued, and it is urgently requested that a letter be sent for strict compliance. Hereafter, your company must comply with the order when repairing and manufacturing ships in order to protect domestic rights and interests and respect the orders of the Executive Yuan and the Ministry. With high regards.</p>
<h3 id="e173">The Only Domestic Candy Factory <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>丨Xianghai Confectionery Factory, Large-Scale and Grand丨</p>
<p>Since China's trade with Europe and the United States, the outflow of money each year has been countless. This is because domestic products are often not as refined or well-made as imported goods, and many cannot be manufactured domestically. Therefore, China has become the world's largest importing country. To fundamentally seek a way to resist this, we must pay attention to whether the manufacturing of domestic goods can surpass imported goods, and whether their value is lower than imported goods. If we can achieve good quality and low prices, why would the Chinese people not be happy to use domestic goods? The confectionery industry, although relatively small in the market, has seen a gradual increase in consumers in recent years, and imports of foreign goods have also increased year by year. However, the prices are high, and ordinary people cannot afford to buy them regularly. If one wants to obtain confectionery that surpasses imported goods at a low price, the various products of the Xianghai Confectionery Factory can be considered satisfactory. The factory is a new-style factory completely operated by Chinese merchants, located at 8 Dithmarschen Road in Hongkou. All of the machinery in the factory was custom-made in Germany, and German technicians lead the work. All workers wear white uniforms and gloves, and the premises are very clean, with no mosquitoes or flies. From stirring the sugar to packaging, everything is made entirely by machines, without manual labor. The equipment is thorough, and hygiene is emphasized, which is truly reliable. Furthermore, all of the sugar that needs to be cooked in the factory is cooked by surrounding it with hot air pipes, so the fresh flavor and vitamins of the sugar are completely preserved. Its most famous products are Fanlexiang candy, Fanle toffee, fruit candy, and Wumuya butter candy, etc. The quality is excellent and the taste is delicious. Once tasted, it is felt that it surpasses imported goods in comparison, and it can be called China's most perfect and mechanized confectionery factory. Its products are popular throughout the country and are sufficient to resist foreign goods and stop leaks. We hope that the Chinese people will pay attention to it amidst the calls to promote domestic goods.</p>

<p>Fined One Hundred and Twenty Yuan. Yu Dongsheng, postman No. 349 at the Post Office branch at the intersection of Avenue Joffre and Rue Massenet in the French Concession, failed to distribute a large bundle of French public reports, weighing eighteen pounds, posted by the French Municipal Council on the 26th of last month. He gave all of them to Xu Xirui, a Ningbo native who was a waiter at a Westerner's house at 142 Rue Grosse, who sold them to Gu’er, a collector of old goods, who resold them to a pancake stall at Rue Coubert. This was discovered by an inspector of the Bureau, who reported it to the Director, who reported it to the police, who dispatched detectives to arrest Yu and the other two. The public reports were retrieved, and they were sent to the Second Special Court for public prosecution on charges of obstructing official duties. The circumstances of the interrogation have been reported previously. After the trial concluded, Judge Zhang Zhaoyou ruled yesterday morning that Yu Dongsheng had concealed mail posted by others and fined him one hundred and twenty yuan. If the fine is commuted to imprisonment, it will be calculated at three yuan per day. The number of days detained before the judgment is final will be used to offset the fine at three yuan per day. Xu Cishui and Gu Hui’er were found not guilty. Yu was released on bail during the appeal period, while Xu and Gu were released in court because the police abandoned the appeal.</p>

<h3 id="e182">Murder Case in a Gutter One and a Half Years Ago Solved <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>The deceased was also a notorious bandit who burned one person to death with kerosene. At around 7 p.m. on February 4 of last year, Sun Yadong, a native of Jiangbei, was assassinated with a knife near a deserted area next to a gutter at the Public Works Bureau Engineering Office near Jingzhou Road and Ningwu Road. The murderer escaped from the scene. Although the police pursued the case, it remained unsolved for a year and a half, and the murderer remained at large. Until the day before yesterday, Shen Yuzhou, a Chinese detective from the Yulin Road Police Station, learned that Zhu Songquan (24 years old), a native of Jiangbei who resided at 588 Yangshupu Road, was involved in the case. He was arrested and sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court yesterday morning. Judge Xiao Fengti interrogated him. Zhang Tianyin, the police lawyer, stated that the case was reported to the police by Tao Pei, a Westerner from the Public Works Bureau at 267 Jingzhou Road, by telephone at 8 a.m. on February 5 of last year, stating that a male corpse was found near the grassy gutter. The police were dispatched to investigate and found that the clothes worn by the deceased were torn at the shoulders, and the outer pants were stripped off. The underwear was pulled down, exposing the lower body. The head was injured by the gutter. He was sent to the police hospital, where the doctor examined him and found three stab wounds on the head from a metal object. The upper joint of the index finger on the right hand was cut off by a knife. There were also several stab wounds on the middle finger and neck. There was a long knife mark from the right ear to the left ear, which was indeed the fatal wound. Next to the corpse were the upper handle of a pair of pliers and a hemp rope. There were many onlookers at the time, but no one recognized the deceased. When the corpse was taken to the morgue for examination, no family members came to claim it. The reason for the murder was unknown. The defendant admitted to the assassination without denial in the police station yesterday. It is said that he has an older sister named Zhu E'zi, who lived with her husband, Jia Mingsheng, in their hometown of Jiangbei. In November of the 20th year of the Republic of China (1931), a large gang of bandits broke into their home and demanded a large sum of money from Jia. When they failed to obtain the money, they tied Jia up with ropes and poured kerosene on him, burning him alive. His sister witnessed the tragedy and recognized the deceased, Sun Yadong, as one of the bandits. The case was reported to the Rugao County government for the arrest of the murderers. Later, his sister, Zhu E'zi, learned that Sun had fled to Shanghai and followed him. She filed a complaint with the defendant, who, together with his friend Li Zhenghong, agreed at the workshop at 24 Hejian Road that night to have Li's friend, surnamed Zhang, lure Sun Yadong to dinner. When Sun arrived at the place, he saw Zhu E'zi and tried to escape in fear. Li and others chased him with pliers and other weapons to a cement gutter at the Public Works Bureau where water was accumulated. They caught up with Sun, and Li struck Sun's head with the pliers, knocking him to the ground. The defendant was frightened and timid at the time, so he did not know how Sun was killed afterward. However, the cause of the case may have been revenge or jealousy. However, the details still need to be investigated and should be postponed. A photograph of the deceased's injuries taken by the former police station was then presented for inspection. After Judge Fan questioned the defendant for a long time, the testimony of the defendant was the same as that of the police lawyer. He then ordered the defendant to be returned to custody and ordered a change of date to clarify and interrogate again.</p>

They were sent to the First Special District Court yesterday morning, where Judge Feng Shide interrogated them. According to police lawyer Ru Baohui, the evidence for the people arrested still needs to be investigated, so it is requested that they still be detained. If it is found that there are no facts of the crime, a request will be made to release them at any time. Judge Feng then questioned the people about their age, name, and occupation. Most of them were natives of Hefei and worked in cloth factories. As a result, the police's request was approved, and all of them were detained for investigation and verification at a later date.</p>
<h3 id="e184">Hunan Woman Suicidal Due to Neurasthenia <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>丨Consuming Opium to End Her Life丨</p>
<p>Luo Yang Wenshu, a 32-year-old woman from Hunan residing at 1340 North Sichuan Road, had a husband named Luo Angfu. Last year, her husband received an appointment from a school in Jiangxi and went there to work as a professor. The woman was unwilling to follow him, so she has been living alone in Shanghai for nearly a year. Several months ago, she suddenly suffered from severe neurasthenia and other ailments. Despite seeking treatment from various sources, she saw no improvement. As a result, she became resentful and harbored thoughts of ending her life a few days ago. She secretly consumed opium in an attempt to commit suicide. Subsequently, a maid living in the same residence discovered the situation and immediately reported it to her master, who then sent her to the hospital for treatment. However, the treatment was ineffective, and she soon died. The hospital reported the matter to the Hongkou Police Station, which ordered Detective Xia Shutang to conduct an investigation. Two suicide notes were found in her bedroom, one addressed to her husband and the other to her husband's cousin, Luo Zhuxu. The notes vaguely stated that she had been suffering from illness for nearly half a year without any sign of recovery, leading her to feel that life was meaningless. The detective then transported the body to the forensic examination office on Follen Road. Yesterday morning, Judge Diao Chengtang, dispatched by the First Special District Local Court, arrived at the office to examine the body. During the official hearing, Zhou Picheng, who identified himself as the second landlord of the residence, testified that the deceased had been renting a small room in his house. He stated that his maidservant had noticed her suicide attempt, and he had sent her to the hospital. Luo Zhuxu also provided a statement. Judge Diao concluded that the deceased, Luo Yang Wenshu, had indeed died due to opium poisoning while still alive. The body was handed over to Luo Zhuxu, who signed a statement acknowledging receipt for coffin and burial.</p>

<p>丨Cause Was Watching Mahjong丨</p>
<p>Wang Fangshi, a 21-year-old woman from Changzhou, and her husband, Wang Yunzhang, a salesman for an insurance company, rented a room above the Xiang Taichang Clothing Store at 602 East Youheng Road. The couple had a harmonious relationship. On the evening of the fourth of this month, Wang returned home from work and saw his wife watching others play mahjong in the shared kitchen area. Wang advised his wife not to watch anymore because the players were all men. Wang felt there was nothing inappropriate about it and refused to comply. As a result, the two argued. The day before yesterday, she thought about it and harbored resentment. She had thoughts of ending her life. When her husband was asleep, she hung herself with a cloth belt. When her husband woke up, he found her barely alive and unable to speak. Wang was extremely shocked. He immediately called the neighbors to send her to Shanghai Sanitarium for treatment, but it was ineffective. She soon died. The hospital reported the incident to the Huishan Police Station, which ordered Detective Wang Tongpo to investigate. The body was transported to the forensic examination office on Follen Road. Yesterday morning, Judge Diao Chengtang, dispatched by the First Special District Local Court, arrived at the office to examine the body. During the official hearing, Wang Yunzhang, the husband of the deceased, and Luo Shirong, who lived together, testified to the above facts. Judge Diao concluded that the deceased, Wang Fangshi, had indeed hanged herself while alive. The body was handed over to her husband, Wang Yunzhang, who signed a statement acknowledging receipt for coffin and burial.</p>

<p>Le Wenrong, a 20-year-old young man from Taiping County, Anhui Province, currently residing at No. 2 Dexing Lane, West Xinjiao Street, in the French Concession, works at Dasheng Phonograph Company. In the spring of last year, he met Wang Abao, a 19-year-old daughter of Wang Jifa, the owner of a rickshaw company in Yuchang Lane, No. 36 Kangti Road, who is from Yancheng. The two fell in love shortly after meeting. Le then asked Chen Peizhang, a detective at the current Municipal Public Security Bureau, to act as a matchmaker to communicate with the girl's parents. On March 17th of the lunar calendar that year, the two parties arranged a formal engagement in a room at the Da You Small Inn at the intersection of Edward Road and Zilaihuo Street. At that time, Le entrusted the matchmaker to pay a tea gift of 150 yuan. Wang handed over a lunar calendar birth date report for the girl, which served as a marriage contract. After that, the girl moved in to live together. A wedding ceremony was to be held on a later date. It was, in reality, a modern form of an adopted daughter-in-law. At the beginning of living together, the engaged couple was deeply in love. However, before long, a rift developed. On August 7th, at 9 p.m., A Bao, while her fiancé and his relatives were out, left without saying goodbye. When Le and his mother returned and learned of this, they checked their belongings and found that a small diamond ring worth 131 yuan, a pearl ring, clothes and other items were missing. At that time, they searched everywhere without success and reported the loss to the police station. It was not until the 3rd of this month that Le learned that his fiancée, Wang Abao, had found a new love and was hiding in Lane 5, Yuanli Lane, Xietu Road, in the Chinese area. He reported this to the local Public Security Bureau, who sent police to arrest the girl and bring her back to the bureau. Because the matter involved domestic trivialities, the police ordered the girl to return home with Le to settle the matter. Unexpectedly, when the girl and Le were on Avenue Joffre not far from home, she suddenly refused to go home and argued on the street. The patrolmen saw this and took the girl to the police station. Detective Han Benyong conducted an investigation. Yesterday morning, the girl was sent to the Second Special Court, where Judge Wu Fanglian interrogated her in the eighth criminal court. First, Gu Shuxi, the lawyer for the police station, explained the case and charged her with theft. Then, the plaintiff, Le Wenrong, recounted the situation of his fiancée's escape and presented the lunar calendar birth date report as evidence. Wang Abao claimed that she had been beaten by her fiancé and his relatives and forced into prostitution, so she had no choice but to escape to work in a silk factory in Hangzhou. At that time, she only took her clothes with her and did not take any other items. She also hired a lawyer to defend herself, while the plaintiff also hired a lawyer to file an incidental private prosecution. The court decided that it was necessary to summon additional witnesses and adjourned the hearing to the 11th. The defendant was released on bail of 300 yuan.</p>

<h3 id="e201">Speaking Up for the Flying Cat <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>— Zhan Lu</p>
<p>A strange cat with two wings on its back was discovered in Pingjin, England. It can also try to fly, but it can't spread its wings in the water. It was abandoned on the side of the road, but is now being raised in the Oxford Zoo. The world is truly full of wonders.</p>
<p>Some superstitious people in England are disgusted by this deformed cat. If it cannot be returned to its original owner, it must be killed to eliminate the unusual. I received this news and am very upset for the flying cat. The English hate the flying cat simply because the cat shouldn't have wings, shouldn't try to fly, and the deformed cat must be killed. However, there are many deformed things in the world. Fish can swim and walk, but there are flying fish in the ocean that leap into the air and quickly fall back to the surface. Snakes crawl, but there are flying snakes in the changing part that can flap their wings into the forest and prey on small birds. There are deformed flying fish and flying snakes, but there are not deformed flying cats. In principle, it is difficult to justify.</p>
<p>Since aviation has developed, flying through the air is considered normal. People who can't fly can fly now. Moreover, once the killing starts, they forget humanitarianism. Many air forces on bombers spread poison in the air and are more fierce than winged tigers. They are simply a team of flying Yaksha, wantonly harming the people below. People even want to fly, let alone cats? What's more, although this cat has two wings, it can't fly high?</p>
<p>Cats have the instinct to catch mice, so there should be flying cats. Bats are also called flying mice. They are the dregs of beasts and the spies of birds. They are neither birds nor beasts. If there are no cats to subdue them, then bats will run wild and belong to two countries. Won't they become the bat world? Although cats can catch mice, they cannot catch bats spinning in the air. The cats have to look up stupidly, just like a toad wanting to eat swan meat. I think that the two-winged cat in the Oxford Zoo should not only not be killed, but also be carefully raised to spread its seeds and cultivate its flying ability! If there are flying cats in the world, then the generation of bat comrades who are both teachers and ghosts can be restrained, right? Haha!</p>

<p>— Yan Qiao</p>
<p>I have never encountered the various ghost tricks that I have seen on paper and heard in my mouth. Although I am not an old Shanghainese, I also know a little about Shanghai's threshold. Who knows that someone came to weigh my weight last night.</p>
<p>I just came out of the Xiaoguanghan listening to drum music. In order to avoid many unexpected troubles, I hired a streetcar even though it was a short distance. Near the intersection of Hankou Road and Shilu Road, suddenly someone shouted behind me:</p>
<p>"Rickshaw puller, slow down!"</p>
<p>The rickshaw puller, whether it was the lesson of experience or because he was chased and caught, really stopped. I thought that I had accidentally torn someone's clothes and had to pay compensation. Who knows that the person who caught up was a black-clad night traveler. I couldn't see his face clearly. Was it ferocious? But the words made people's hearts beat faster. He said:</p>
<p>"Help me."</p>
<p>At that time, I was holding sixteen copper coins, ready to pay for the car. While I kept saying "No", I paid attention to his movements. How ridiculous! (I laughed after thinking about it later, but I couldn't laugh at the time.) His right hand grabbed the rickshaw hood pole, and his left hand reached into his waist to grope. There was no doubt that he was going to show me the pistol that everyone was afraid to see.</p>
<p>I don't know if his art of using an empty city strategy was not skillful enough, or if he saw that I was a poor scholar without blood? He said a slightly tough sentence first:</p>
<p>"Really don't have it?"</p>
<p>Then he said a softening sentence:</p>
<p>"Help me a little!"</p>
<p>At that time, a clever idea came to me. I quickly handed him the car fare and said:</p>
<p>"Take this!"</p>
<p>The following outcome was really unexpected. He contemptuously released his right hand, turned around and left, and muttered in his mouth:</p>
<p>"Who wants copper coins!"</p>
<p>But when I heard this sentence, it was as if I had received the edict of the Emperor: "Forgive you for having no blood. You are unlucky. I hereby proclaim!"</p>
<p>This farce is a new record in my life history. Perhaps the old Shanghainese find it unremarkable, but at least it can be used as a topic for conversation after tea and dinner.</p>
<p>After I finished writing this script, I wanted to write a title. I thought of an old saying in Suzhou, called "There are no gentlemen on the road." It means that when you are extremely bored and walk to the end of the road, there is no gentlemanly style. But I want to praise the man in black, who is a "gentleman on the road."</p>
<h3 id="e203">『Cowherd and Weaver Girl』 Talk by a Scientist <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>— Qing Qu</p>
<p>"Cowherd and Weaver Girl" is a beautiful legend that has been passed down through the generations about two stars meeting once a year. Ancient poets would often sing and write about it, as if they believed it to be a real event. But where did they ever see the "magpies bridging the river"? Alas, if we were to investigate it carefully, we would realize that the so-called "Milky Way" of the past was merely an abstract concept, not based on actual measurements. Therefore, the terms "Cowherd" and "Weaver Girl" came into being. Looking at the "Book of Songs," it says, "In the heavens is the Han River, shining brightly. There is the Weaver Girl, weaving busily all day long." There is only the Weaver Girl, but no Cowherd. Even among the poets, the one who excelled was Chen of the Tang Dynasty. However, his focus was always on the Weaver Girl, and he never mentioned the Cowherd star. It is clear that it was a fabrication, not something they believed to be true. The "Milky Way" is actually a gathering of countless stars, so its volume is extremely small, and its color is very faint. It has many names, such as "stellar gas," "nebula," "star cluster," "star sea," or "star swarm." These are all names for the "Milky Way." If you use the largest telescope to observe it, you can clearly distinguish the "star clusters," but not the "stellar gas." You can also divide it into two hemispheres, northeast and southwest, with a slightly thin and narrow strip in the middle, which can be called the "star belt." In reality, it is the "Milky Way," also known as the "Celestial River," and there is no difference!</p>
<p>Therefore, the story of "Cowherd and Weaver Girl" is very interesting, but when observed through the experiments of scientists, it is debunked. Since the implementation of the new calendar, many women still follow the old customs on the night of the seventh day of the seventh lunar month, reciting, "On this seventh night, look to the clear sky, the Cowherd and Weaver Girl cross the river bridge. Every household begs for skill, threading hundreds of red silks." According to their understanding, they only know about the "Weaver Girl," and the "Cowherd" is left for men to worship. However, after searching through piles of texts, one cannot find anything solely dedicated to praising the "Cowherd." This is truly unfathomable. Could it be an example of the ancient practice of "valuing women and belittling men"?</p>

<p>Chapter 14: Difficulty in Finding a Spouse, Hesitant and Anxious / Inviting Friends to a Small Gathering, Remembering Past Studies</p>
<p>Just as he was about to serve the rice balls to everyone, Tian Qing waved his hand and said, "We'll get them ourselves, you can go." The waiter left, and Tian Qing brought a bowl of rice balls to Zhao Ziqiang and replied, "Thank you for your trouble. Please send it to Ms. Yang. You must say something polite, not just shove it in front of her without a word." Zhao Ziqiang was, after all, a man, so he couldn't ignore Tian Qing's words. He had to hold the bowl with both hands and brought it to Gui Zhi, saying, "Please have some." Gui Zhi knew that this was making him very difficult, so she immediately stood up. She kept a straight face, neither smiling nor saying anything. Tian Qing laughed and said, "Ms. Yang, that's not right of you. He's being so polite, bringing the rice balls to you. How can you just accept them without saying a word?" Gui Zhi said to Man Ying, "Your Company Commander Tian is always joking. Are you going to do anything about it?" Man Ying laughed and said, "I'm not a soldier, how can he be my company commander?" Gui Zhi didn't say anything more to them, and sat down to eat her rice balls. Tian Qing turned to Zhao Ziqiang and said, "What's wrong? You're done again. Keep talking!" Zhao Ziqiang laughed and said, "I'm not very good at this, and you're still making things difficult for me." When Gui Zhi heard this, her heart stirred. She remembered talking with Ji Zhi here, and he had said something similar. Who would have thought that today, she was going to marry someone named Zhao? Thinking about this, her face turned red as she ate her rice balls without looking up. Everyone assumed that she was shy, a young woman in this kind of place. Zhao Ziqiang's words were already open enough, so they didn't say anything more. Then, Tian Qing smiled at Man Ying, and Zhao Ziqiang also smiled when he saw it. Even when Gui Zhi looked up, she gave a faint smile. (181)</p>

<p>— New and Old Debris</p>
<p>This morning, I was shocked to hear of the passing of my friend Shanren. I rushed to the Chinese Funeral Home on Ge Road to mourn him. The small room was cramped, and his body lay there. There were no white horses, only green flies attending. Four sentences cannot capture the abrupt separation of man and heaven. I asked his eldest son about his unpublished works, but he replied that he had not had time to organize them due to his illness. The end of a scholar is this desolate. Grieving for the departed, I shall think of myself. Remembering Ziyun, I will collect the scattered remnants and spread them in his place. It is the responsibility of those who live on, and the world has many interpreters. I will not let them be lost and forgotten. My sorrow is not yet exhausted. I present these four couplets, ashamed of my lack of talent, but perhaps they can summarize his life.</p>
<p>First:</p>
<p>Unable to resist the foreign enemy, it is better to die than live? (You said that not resisting Japan is a sign that the hearts of the people are dead.)</p>
<p>Without any attachments, he went to Shanghai alone, forgetting his family for the sake of the country.</p>
<p>Second:</p>
<p>Awake alone and pure, he continued until his death. (After you moved to Shanghai, you did not pursue an official career.)</p>
<p>Both Confucian and Buddhist, his life had a source. (You used spirit writing to conceal yourself and also liked to study Buddhist scriptures and Zen sayings.)</p>
<p>Third:</p>
<p>Children see deep affection, and righteous daughters and sons shed many tears. (You had many adopted children.)</p>
<p>A combination of chivalrous scholar, there is a true evaluation of great scholars and heroes. (You were enthusiastic about justice and loved to help others in the association you belonged to.)</p>
<p>Fourth:</p>
<p>Pure breeze in Shanghai, eradicating corruption and restoring justice with bare hands? (You led the newspaper with verbal attacks and writing, without any scruples.)</p>
<p>His great name stands like Mount Song, his actions fragrant, his aspirations pure, and he has already determined his legacy.</p>

<h3 id="e206">First Rain (Part 1) <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>— Hu Liwen</p>
<p>Although it is already autumn, the weather is even hotter than summer. Sweat flows incessantly all day long. My mind is somewhat dazed. I want to write a letter home to comfort my mother, but when I hold the pen, I can't write a word. Really, what should I write? It has been several years since I left my hometown. Work has consumed me, leaving me no time to rest, let alone a chance to return home! My mother has written several times to ask about my situation. Of course, I can't tell her the truth, because I'm afraid of hurting her. Although I don't want to lie to her, I have no choice but to do so. In my replies, I always say that everything is fine.</p>
<p>Today, after returning from work, my clothes were soaked with sweat. As usual, I took a bath, changed my clothes, and sat in this wooden box-like room, turned on the electric light, and wanted to read a book. But it felt like an indelible plaster was stuck on my heart. I only read two lines and threw it away. I felt vexed, as if something was gnawing at my heart. I quickly walked to the window, looking at the southern sky, where clusters of catkin-like dark clouds were surging up. Under those dark clouds was my hometown!</p>
<p>Suddenly, a gust of wind brushed my face, and the dark clouds surged up even more, gradually covering the entire sky. The first gust of slanting rain followed, pouring against the window. I quickly closed the window and retreated to the bed. All sorts of thoughts flooded my mind like arrows. I wanted to cry. I covered my face, and tears flowed from between my fingers. The weather seemed to have turned cooler. Raindrops hit the banana leaves and the glass window in the courtyard, making a sound like the rapid beating of war drums. Inside the room, only the electric light blinked, laughing coldly at me. I hated it. I tossed and turned, burying my face in the pillow. I wanted to die, I wanted to commit suicide. I cursed everyone, hated everyone. Their words were all lies. They could buy your body with money, buy your freedom. But I couldn't bear to leave my loving mother, so I was now alive, struggling, even though living had no meaning.</p>
<p>I didn't know when I had returned to my hometown. I stepped into the house and saw my sister cooking in the stove, the smoke filling the room. I forgot that I was carrying a heavy package on my shoulder. I jumped forward and called out, "Sister!" She looked up, saw that it was me, and quickly dropped the thin firewood in her hand, ran over to shake my hand. She smiled and said to me:</p>
<p>"I knew you would definitely come back today, so I cooked many dishes that you like to eat, waiting for you to eat them."</p>
<p>She pointed a finger at the bowls on an old table against the wall and reported to me: Mother is sick, in the room. I followed her to my mother's room. My mother was in bed, her face very pale. This scene filled my heart with half sweetness, half bitterness. I ran to the bed like a madman. I wanted to say something, but there were too many words, and I didn't know where to start. When my mother saw me coming, a mixture of sadness and joy appeared on her troubled face. She reached out and touched my head, saying</p>
<p>"Xiuer, you're back!"</p>
<p>"Yes, I'm back, Mother!"</p>
<p>Mother patted the edge of the bed and told me to sit down. I took off the package on my shoulder, gave it to my sister, and sat on the edge of the bed. My mother held my hand and asked me to tell her about what I was doing outside. I didn't dare to tell the truth. I made up a lie and told her. She shook her head, seemingly unwilling to believe it. Suddenly, tears flowed from her sunken eyes. She choked and said:</p>
<p>"Xiuer, don't lie to me, you've lost weight, you've lost a lot of weight, you must be uncomfortable there?" "No! It's very comfortable there!"</p>
<p>No matter what, I can't tell her, I can only lie to her until the end.</p>

<p>(Written for the establishment of the Shanghai Children's Welfare Committee)</p>
<p>Amidst the abnormal, excessive, or insufficient treatment of children in China, they have always been regarded as rare toys or unnecessary burdens, unable to obtain the necessary natural development. In all aspects of life, all kinds of evil consequences – weakness, sickness, stupidity, selfishness – are rooted in this period. Because parents use unscientific methods of loving (?), the results are often the opposite of what they expect. We often see that many children in society live in a state of premature aging, losing their lively youthful appearance. This is truly an astonishing and strange phenomenon. No one can deny that the warriors our nation needs now and in the future are strong, brave, intelligent youths who can sacrifice themselves for the public good. Therefore, we must use scientific training methods in children's education to overcome the unscientific love of the past, to maintain the lively and pure spirit of children, and to hone the strong and brave strength of children. All doting on children is a poison that harms children, and it is a poison that harms the nation. Parents and teachers must have a full understanding of this. Today is the day of the establishment of the Shanghai Children's Welfare Committee, so I offer my sentiments to the gentlemen engaged in the children's welfare movement as a reference.</p>

<h3 id="e243">From Deafness to Muteness <a href="#e243" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c243" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">243</a></h3>
<p>— Luo Wen</p>
<p>Doctors tell us that many mutes are not actually unable to speak with their throats and tongues. It's just that they've been deaf since childhood, unable to hear adults speaking, with nothing to imitate. They assume that everyone else is just opening their mouths and making meaningless noises, so naturally, they can only do the same. Therefore, when Georg Brandes lamented the decline of Danish literature, he said: Literary creation is almost completely dead. No matter what kind of human or social issues arise, they fail to evoke any interest, or, aside from newspapers and magazines, they never stir up any debate. We see no strong, original creations. Moreover, there is now almost absolute disregard for absorbing the spiritual life of foreign countries. Thus, spiritual 'deafness' inevitably leads to 'muteness.' (Preface to the first volume of "Main Currents in Nineteenth-Century Literature")</p>
<p>These words can also be applied to critique China's literary and artistic circles. This phenomenon cannot be entirely blamed on the oppression of the oppressors. The enlightenment thinkers of the May Fourth Movement and their subsequent opponents should both share the responsibility. The former were too eager for quick results and did not translate many valuable books. The latter deliberately vented their anger, even scolding translators as matchmakers. Some young people added fuel to the fire, and for a time, even including the original text when annotating names of people and places for readers' reference was denounced as "pedantry."</p>
<p>What is the situation now? Bookstores with three-bay storefronts are not uncommon on the Fourth Road, but the shelves are full of thin booklets. To find a large volume is as difficult as sifting gold from sand. Of course, being tall and fat doesn't make one a great man, and producing a lot and in great detail doesn't necessarily make one a masterpiece, especially with "cut-and-paste" work. However, a small "What ABC" booklet can never encompass all academic and artistic knowledge. A stream of turbid water is not as clean and clear as a glass of pure water, but distilling a portion of the turbid stream can yield many glasses of pure water.</p>
<p>Due to years of selling empty promises, the literary world has become desolate. Although the form of writing has become relatively more polished, the fighting spirit has declined rather than advanced. Writers become famous quickly through bought titles or mutual praise, but because of vigorous puffery, the shell becomes larger, while the inside appears even more hollow. Consequently, they mistake this emptiness for loneliness, seriously telling it to the readers. Some even go so far as to display the decay of their hearts as a kind of inner treasure. Essays are considered successful in the literary garden, but even the top three selections of this year's anthologies give one the feeling of "the sable coat is insufficient, so a dog's tail is used to continue it." Using chaff to feed the youth will never make them strong. Future achievements will be even smaller, resembling the "last man" described by Nietzsche.</p>
<p>But introducing foreign intellectual currents, translating world masterpieces, all the routes for transporting spiritual food, are now almost blocked by the manufacturers of deafness and muteness. Even foreign lackeys and rich young masters will sneer at it. They want to cover the ears of the youth, causing them to become deaf and mute, withered and small, becoming the "last man." They will not rest until everyone can only watch the erotic pictures sold by rich men's sons and mistresses. The struggle of authors and translators who are willing to be like soil has reached a point where it cannot be delayed. This means striving to transport some real spiritual food and placing it around the youth, while sending those manufacturers of deafness and muteness back to the dark caves and mansions.</p>
<h3 id="e244">The Sorrow of the Literati <a href="#e244" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c244" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">244</a></h3>
<p>— Huo Yun</p>
<p>Reading the local news in the Shen Bao of the sixth, I learned that the young writer</p>
<p>was liberated, and fortunately, he did not die under the knife or in a ditch, but rather "died peacefully in his sleep" at the Red Cross Hospital, which is considered "a blessing from heaven." Therefore, we don't need to feel sad or mourn for him.</p>
<p>I had known him for less than half a year. Every time I saw him, I always felt that his "face was pale," which proves that he was in a state of semi-starvation for a long time. I heard that he had been in prison and suffered torture. Life was like a sharp knife, cutting him apart inch by inch, and like a heavy rock, pressing him down firmly. However, he never succumbed to life or assimilated to the environment. He would rather chew coarse bread than chew on his own integrity, and would rather starve to death than sell himself piecemeal. Every time I saw him, his seemingly weary but very resolute spirit always made me feel awe-struck. In this era, he was unfortunate enough to be born without the innate ability to be a "dog." His suffering from cold and hunger, and even going to prison and being tortured, was perhaps "deserved." However, this is precisely what makes Peng Konghuang memorable to me.</p>
<p>He died in a third-class ward of the Red Cross Hospital. Of course, his death was partly due to illness, but also partly due to poverty. After his death, he left behind a widow and orphans. The deceased could not be buried, and the living could not live. A writer who strives to transform society receives such a cold reward from society. I think this is truly the sorrow of the literati.</p>
<p>At this point, I think that some of the writers who truly make a living by selling their writing rather than selling their integrity should, regardless of their literary and artistic affiliations, sincerely organize themselves and, starting from the great sympathy of mankind, engage in mutual assistance in life. When something like Peng's death occurs, where the deceased cannot be buried and the surviving family cannot live, they can use this kind of mutual assistance to settle the matter.</p>
<p>But this may just be my personal ideal, because on the current Chinese literary scene, a live drama of "people eating people" is流行(popular), and "mutual assistance" will certainly be regarded as "theory of pedantic scholars."</p>
<h3 id="e245">Night at the Beach (Continued) <a href="#e245" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c245" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">245</a></h3>
<p>— Bing Xin</p>
<p>"No, we must go forward, all the way to where there are lights." Chen said resolutely.</p>
<p>"There are too many rocks ahead, and the ground is wet, making it difficult to walk. Anyway, it's the beach, so it's the same as here."</p>
<p>"No! We don't care about the rocks or the wetness. In short, we must go forward and walk to where there are lights."</p>
<p>"Lights? It's just a small boat traveling on the sea. Look, the more we go forward, the farther it gets away from us. If we chase it like this, I'm afraid we won't catch up with it until dawn."</p>
<p>It was Xin's discovery that reconciled the conflict between the two. Not far from the swimming pool, the three sat down together. The fine sand was so soft and lovely, like sitting on a velvet carpet. The coolness that penetrated to the bones was like entering a crystal palace. Xin and Chen both lay down, but Zhu was still sitting. She was an older sister, afraid of getting her clothes dirty or the dampness affecting her, causing her back pain, so she wouldn't lie down no matter what.</p>
<p>There was no sound. They were now each enjoying their own happiness, each imagining their own future.</p>
<p>"If I have a chance to build a small house by the sea, every night I would come out for a walk with two or three friends, watching the moonlight and the sea embrace, listening to the whispers of the tide and the gentle breeze. In the morning, I would absorb the fresh air by the sea and watch the beautiful sunrise. During the day, when others are dying from the heat, I would open the windows on all sides and let the cool sea breeze blow in to let me read. When tired, I would let the god of sleep take me to sweet dreams... I don't need anything else, just a chance to live this kind of life for a while, and my life will be happy!"</p>
<p>This was Zhu's hope.</p>
<p>"Let me lie here quietly, don't wake me up, let me enjoy the natural beauty like tonight forever. This beautiful moon, the magnificent sound of the waves, the great sea has melted my soul. I have no dreams, I only wish I could lie here forever like this, with the moon, the sea, and the wind never leaving me."</p>
<p>Chen was scientific, but at this moment, he completely forgot his interests. All that existed in his mind was the goal of enjoying the natural beauty as much as possible. He wanted to grasp this moment tightly, he wished the night, this beautiful night would never disappear forever. Only Xin, this poor child, was indeed too bitter. On the one hand, she compared the tide to the times, saying that the angry tide of revolution was like the sea, and no one wanted to resist it when the tide came. It could sweep away all obstacles, wash away all dirt, and destroy all solid dikes. She loved the sea because of its greatness, the magnificence of the seawater. She believed that every sound of the waves colliding was the power of life, not only the sea's, but also people's life force. She wanted to throw herself into the revolutionary furnace, sacrifice herself in the pool of bright red blood; but on the other hand, she loved the silence of the sea, the tenderness of the sea, and the beauty of the green seawater. She wished to walk slowly into the sea under the dim moonlight, letting the magnificent waves play a dirge, and the gentle sea breeze gently caress her corpse floating on the blue waves. The Moon Sister and the stars would emit compassionate light to mourn her. In this way, quietly, without anyone knowing, except for the moon, starlight, wind, and sea, she left this troubled world and realized the ideal of "I don't want anyone to see my corpse."</p>
<p>The night deepened, and the sound of the wind gradually became sharp. The sound of the waves became even louder, and the tide had risen to the feet of where they were lying. Xin really wanted to put her ideals into practice, but there were still two people next to her hindering her.</p>
<p>Because of Zhu's urging, they reluctantly said goodbye to the sea and lazily stepped onto the lonely road home in the moonlight.</p>

<p>— A Ying</p>
<p>(4) Banning Su Dongpo's Writings</p>
<p>Su Dongpo's writings were once banned, which is truly astonishing to modern people. I saw a record of "Banning Su Dongpo's Writings" in Fei Buzhi's "Liangxi Random Notes," Volume 7, which said:</p>
<p>During the Xuanhe period (Song dynasty), the ban on Su Dongpo's writings was very strict. A scholar secretly carried Dongpo's collected works out of the city, but was caught by the gatekeeper and sent to the authorities. Seeing a poem at the end of the collection, it said:</p>
<p>Where the literary star falls, heaven and earth weep,</p>
<p>This old man is dead, and my path is exhausted.</p>
<p>His talent far surpassed that of Sheng Zhongda,</p>
<p>But even in death, his fame is still feared by Yao Chong.</p>
<p>The human world feels devoid of purity,</p>
<p>Has the country ever recognized the ancient style?</p>
<p>Who cherished ten thousand pieces in his lifetime?</p>
<p>The Six Ding (Taoist deities) collect them and send them to the Jade Palace.</p>
<p>The magistrate, admiring his character and fearing implication, secretly let him go.</p>
<p>The misfortune of Su Dongpo's writings can be seen from this small note. At the same time, it can be remembered that no matter how you ban it, those who need it will always need it. Qin Shi Huang was the most thorough, he simply started with the "scholars" who could write books, "burning books" and "burying scholars alive." What was the result?</p>
<p>Books exist, and scholars have not been "extinct." Those who need them will have their own methods of obtaining and printing them. "Very strict" is useless. If everyone does not need it, even if the powerful give all kinds of assistance, there will be no slightest push. Overthrow the enemy and support oneself. If this "oneself" is "deeply hated and loathed" by everyone, assistance will not be able to support it.</p>

<p>— Shen Congwen</p>
<p>A car stopped on the land in front of the XX Hotel in Xishan. A man came out, a handsome and beautiful man, and a woman, a woman in a green silk gown. The two looked at a bright room on the third floor. After a while, the luggage on the car, a yellow box, a small black typewriter box, was moved from downstairs. The woman told the uniformed servant and told the driver to wait for an hour before going down the mountain.</p>
<p>An hour later, when the car was running towards the city on the flat official road of Bali Zhuang, it was just an empty car.</p>
<p>Near dusk, the man, wearing a thin woolen coat, stood with the woman on the stone railing of the hotel roof, looking at a wisp of haze flowing between the flat fields and distant villages under the mountain. There were clouds in the sky like a woman's cheeks, and a star appeared in the northeast corner of the sky. Everything was like a dream. In front of the hotel was the avenue leading to the Upper Eight Great Sites. On the mountain road, there were two schoolgirls wearing middle school uniforms and a man in a turn-down collar shirt and yellow shorts, asking the hotel doorman for directions to a certain place on the mountain. At a glance, you could tell that these young people were traveling together from the city.</p>
<p>The woman looked at the man beside her, who had just recovered from a long illness, and sighed softly.</p>
<p>About half a mile from the hotel, there was a small mound, planted entirely with black locust trees. The woods were bathed in the setting sun, and the yellow leaves felt even more dazzling. The man seemed interested in the small mound and said to the woman:</p>
<p>"Shall we go over there and take a look?"</p>
<p>The woman glanced at his face and said softly:</p>
<p>"Shouldn't you be resting?"</p>
<p>"I like that little mountain." The man said, "It seems like this mountain belongs to us."</p>
<p>"You can't get too tired!" Although the woman said that, she turned aside to let the man go first. "I feel great, let's go have some fun, and we'll have a good meal when we come back."</p>
<p>The two soon arrived at the woods on the mound. Everything here was exactly the same as the seaside place three years ago. When the two walked into the woods, they were both surprised and walked quickly through the woods as if at the end of the woods was the vast sea that changes without end. But when they reached the end of the woods, they realized that there was no sea in front of them, but just a private cemetery. The woman was stunned when she saw the cemetery and stood there in a daze. The man didn't notice the cemetery, but smiled happily, because further away, the setting sun gilded everything on the earth, and the extraordinary scenery in front of him was indescribably magnificent.</p>
<p>The man seemed to have walked a little too quickly and was panting slightly. After handing his hand to the woman, he asked the woman if this place was like a place that the two were very familiar with. When she heard this question, she sighed slightly, smiled reluctantly, and used this smile to conceal her emotions.</p>
<p>"Memories make people younger." The man said to himself.</p>
<p>But the woman answered in her heart: "When a person lives on memories, it shows that all that is left of this person's life are just some residual dregs.</p>
<p>The evening breeze gently brushed the locust trees, and yellow leaves fell on the two people and around their feet. The man was very happy in his heart and deliberately said in a sentimental way:</p>
<p>"Summer is over, spring is ahead of summer, and autumn comes after summer. What a beautiful autumn!"</p>
<p>As he spoke, he looked at the woman's eyes, eyebrows, mouth, and nose, which had an autumnal feel. She was indeed beautiful, but at a glance, you could tell that this beauty was not the flourishing flowers of March, but the yellow leaves of August. But now he felt that she was particularly lovely, and he felt that that touch of charm made her transcend the limitations of time and become eternally innocent and lovely, and eternally moving and absorbing. He thought of the relationship between the two over the years, how it was intertwined with tears and smiles. He thought of the things that happened to her because she loved him, and he thought of himself, how he had been loved over the years, but at first glance, it seemed that he was deliberately avoiding it, but in fact, it was just an irrational rejection. He felt a bit ashamed, stretched out a hand to the woman, and when the two held hands and looked into each other's eyes, he said softly apologetically:</p>

<p>U.S. Government Pressures Banks to Extend Credit</p>
<p>Market Sentiment Weak, Resulting in a Fall of $5.50</p>
<p>Yesterday, the gold market showed overseas silver markets contracting in both England and the United States. The pound rose $0.25 against the dollar, while the dollar fell by $0.015 against the pound. The forward silver price on the Five Metals Exchange fell by varying amounts, from 0.22 to 0.36 cents. Privately telegraphed silver was down $0.0025, while U.S. cotton was up 19 points. U.S. wheat rose by one cent, and stock prices showed insignificant fluctuations of less than one dollar. The morning opening was flat, then trended higher. After the opening, the domestic market seemed strong initially but then deteriorated downstream. HSBC's exchange rate listing was flat for the pound but down $0.00125 for the dollar. The situation was stable at the announcement, with minimal ups and downs. Market sentiment was not firm. After entering the market, the exchange rate continued to harden, and the gold price fell. Weak market sentiment later resulted in a downstream trend, but it was difficult to break the $0.90 barrier. Banks bought on the cheap, returning to a flat trend. Overall, the day's market went from strong to tired, mainly due to general long positions taking profits and selling. Reuters reported that President Roosevelt addressed the Chicago convention of the American Bankers Association, ordering them to expand credit lending. The government would exert pressure on banks. Jones also commented that banks holding funds without lending were no different from hoarding currency, leading to weakening sentiment. The price of gold struggled to maintain $0.985, and the base price increased by $270. The day's market conditions are recorded below. The morning opening was $829, slightly up $2 from the previous close. Goods opened at $0.088. The morning exchange rate opened with a recent selling price of 1 shilling, 3 pence, 0.1875 for the pound, and $0.9875 for the dollar. Zhaofeng, Changheng, Yu, and others were selling goods, while Anda sold U.S. dollars for the current month at $0.8125 to HSBC, down from $0.92 to $0.0625. Richangs, Yuanfeng, and Yong bought on the cheap, returning to $0.085. However, Citibank's offering of U.S. dollars for October at $0.99, with Hengtai and others selling forward contracts, caused a fall back to $0.0625. HSBC listed the exchange rate as flat for the pound but down $0.00125 for the dollar. At the announcement, the Dalian gang paid forward, stabilizing the situation. Citibank and Huabi paid for U.S. dollars for December at $0.04375. Zhaofeng, Chang, and others advanced to $0.081, while Yuanxing, Yongqing, and Fafa sold off and continued to decline. Thereafter, trading was quiet, with little fluctuation, hovering around $0.075 for quite some time. Goods were consistently supplied. HSBC once offered U.S. dollars for October at $0.99, but it fell to $0.065. Hengyu, Yuanmao, and Yong paid for forward contracts, pulling up by one dollar. Hengyu, Yuanheng, Shunli, Wanxing, Xianghe, and others jointly sold off. Zhenggin and Huabi, though taking U.S. dollars for December at $0.04375, were resold by others and not obtained. The gold price then retreated to within $0.06. Dafa Yong bought, barely breaking even. With difficulty, a half-dollar for December seemed hard to sell. Fuyu and Yongfeng entered the market to sell forward contracts. The noon close fell to $824.70. After the market, Fuyu and Goods continued to sell, retreating to within $0.035. Goods were then auctioned at $0.035.</p>
<p>The afternoon opening retreated to $0.028, while Goods opened at $0.03. Ruikang sold forward contracts, retreating to $0.025. Daxing, Yongzheng, and Chang entered to buy forward contracts, rising to $0.039. Hengxing, Dadecheng, Yuansheng, and Yongxiang successively sold forward contracts. Pangen, having paid $0.05625 for U.S. dollars for December, found it difficult to exit and fell to $0.0005. Hengyu took profits on the cheap, returning to $0.019. Hengxing continued to sell, causing a fall to $0.10. Wanxing and Fuyu bought, and Citibank eagerly purchased U.S. dollars for December at $0.0625, causing a rebound. Hengyu advanced to above $0.02.

<p>Continuing to Fall by One to Four Jiao, Only the Demobilization Bond Rose by Five Fen. Yesterday, the Chinese Securities Exchange was weak due to a lack of confidence. Bulls showed signs of turning bearish, but there was still some buying interest in the market. Prices initially rose but then weakened. The situation was entirely driven by the different supply and demand of securities, which affected the price increases and decreases. There were no changes in the overall environment. Minister Song's loan of 12 million yuan was not significantly related to the future of the bond market. Regarding the future of the Lushan Conference, opinions differed. Many believed that Minister Song's return would bring new developments in finance, while bears believed that pledging cotton and wheat to banks would negatively impact the financial sector. Different people had different interpretations. However, prices had been falling for four consecutive days, and a slight rebound was expected. Yesterday morning, various factions slightly increased their buying activity, and prices gradually rose by about three jiao. In the second session, No. 31 customer turned from bearish to bullish, mainly to close out the long positions for this month. Forward contracts released a large number of short positions, which caused the slightly recovering market to be sold off and suppressed. Taiwan also fueled the selling pressure, and prices failed to stabilize, instead falling back by one to three jiao. In the afternoon's quiet trading session, retail investors, seeing the unfavorable situation, also closed out their long positions. New entrants took the opportunity to push prices down, resulting in a further decline of five fen to three jiao. The closing prices were still relatively stable. The prices of previously listed bonds remained slightly lower by one or two jiao, while the consolidated salt tax bond showed signs of gradually strengthening and slightly rebounding. As a result, only the demobilization bond rose slightly by five fen, while the rest continued to fall by one to four and a half jiao. The future may see a slight rebound. The total transaction volume was 8,815,000 yuan. There were no spot transactions at all. The total volume of futures contracts was 2,940,000 yuan for consolidated salt tax bonds, 765,000 yuan for demobilization bonds, 1,185,000 yuan for the 19th issue, 1,625,000 yuan for the 20th issue, 1,325,000 yuan for the 96th issue, and the rest ranged from 10,000 to 200,000 yuan.</p>

<p>The New Feng Foreign Firm reported that the New York stock market was listless throughout the 6th due to a lack of buying interest, resulting in a six-point decline. At the close, news of Alaska Gold Mine's recent acceptance of many orders, which could yield a 50% profit, pushed oil prices higher. The election in Wovoka, Nevada, favored the lifting of alcohol prohibition. Therefore, gold mine stocks, oil stocks, and liquor stocks were stable, and prices rose, especially for oil stocks. The total trading volume for the day was 1,880,000 shares. Wheat prices rose due to continued dry weather, and buying interest was strong. Cotton prices rose because it was difficult to estimate cotton production after cotton fields were destroyed, leading to significant discrepancies in private estimates, averaging 12,100,000 bales. The market saw considerable buying activity, mainly in anticipation that the government's production estimate would be lower than private estimates. The Dow Jones indices are listed below:</p>

<p>Yesterday, after the flour market opened in the morning, prices for each month showed a stable trend. Quotes for imported wheat were up about three jiao in Chicago and down about one jiao in Canada. Therefore, the opening prices were stable, and the Shandong faction showed some buying interest, which further boosted confidence. However, mills also gradually sold off their holdings, so while market sentiment was good, price increases were limited. When the market opened in the afternoon, the current month's market showed some improvement, up about one fen compared to the morning. However, after the second session, due to sluggish actual sales, mills continued to sell off their holdings, and bulls also gradually closed out their positions, so the trend did not improve. Looking at the subsequent trend, it seems to be consolidating. As a result, the current month was down two and a half li compared to the previous day, October was down seven and a half li, November to January was down five li, and February was down seven and a half li.</p>

<p>| Completely Listless |</p>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat futures market largely remained in a consolidating state. Quotes for imported wheat were up about three li in Chicago and down about one jiao in Canada. Therefore, after the opening prices, market sentiment was flat. On the buying side, due to sluggish sales in the current flour market, buying interest was weak. On the selling side, sellers were not willing to sell cheaply because they felt that future wheat storage was not urgent. Therefore, no transactions occurred between the two sides, resulting in a standoff. As a result, only October was up one fen, while the rest remained unchanged. Observing the subsequent trend, it is necessary for flour sales to improve before the market can become lively.</p>

The prices of Changbang, Sutongbang, and Nangang glutinous rice, as well as Du Yangjian rice, remained unchanged. Although the demand for Qingjiao and Songsi thin rice was limited, sellers boosted prices due to the scarcity of goods, so the market was slightly tight, and prices rose slightly. Yuan rice continued to weaken, while Yin rice remained flat. New He Xia glutinous rice was soft, and factory Dong new glutinous rice fell again by two jiao.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, there were about 20 sources of supply from He Xia. Sales of various types of rice in the market were ordinary.

<p>Yesterday, the business of local merchants was good, and the market was firm. There were not many arrivals. Merchants from Fujian and Zhejiang continued to show strong interest in procurement. New Hunan rice and new Nanjing rice were all purchased by the Quanzhou faction. The demand from the provincial capital faction in Fujian was also strong. However, due to slight disruptions in exchange rates and transportation in recent days, they planned to wait and see for the time being. However, they will need to continue procurement in the future, so confidence is very good. Yesterday, foreign rice was easy to sell. The Zhejiang faction also inquired, but buyers intended to cut prices by one jiao, while sellers wanted to raise prices, so no agreement was reached. The entire city only sold 300 bags of Xiaojiao rice at the previous price. The trend for Saigon rice turned tighter. Zhejiang-Ningbo offered 290 bags of old Jiangxi machine rice due to the failure to conclude a deal for foreign rice, priced at 7.056 yuan. Quanzhou, Fujian purchased 70 bags of new Hunan machine Jing rice, priced at 6.60 yuan, and 410 bags of new Nanjing machine Xian rice, priced at 6.30 yuan for Xiaojiao rice and 6.75 yuan.

<p>and around 30-40 trucks of Changzhou beans. The market was slightly lively yesterday, but only 1,120 bags of Jiujiang beans, 5 trucks of Changzhou beans, and 73 bags of Hankou beans were sold. Selling prices were slightly reduced compared to the previous day.</p>
<h3 id="e268">Silk and Tea: Low Cost of Zhejiang Autumn Cocoons <a href="#e268" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c268" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">268</a></h3>
<p>Wuxi Autumn Cocoons Expected to Rise. Autumn cocoons have been on the market in various cities and villages for three days. The early batch of cocoons is the best, while the later batch is inferior due to weather damage. Over 100 cocoon shops in the surrounding villages have opened for business, and arrivals in the market are gradually increasing. Various shops are lowering prices to compete for purchases. High-quality Southern cocoons have already reached 40 yuan, while the rest range from 25 to 35 yuan.</p>
<p>Hangzhou Cocoons Show Little Loss During Reeling. Autumn cocoons from Hangzhou have been on the market for several days. New dry cocoons have been transported to Shanghai for factory trials. The results show little loss during reeling. On average, 500 catties of dry cocoons yield 100 catties of silk, and 300 catties of fresh cocoons are lost during drying. Therefore, the cost of this year's autumn cocoons is about 600 yuan per net extraction.</p>
<p>Smooth Sales of Artificial Silk at Stable Prices. Recently, foreign exchange rates have risen, and the spot price for this month's cargo of artificial silk such as "Hai Fei" and other brands is 52 boxes, ranging from 180.75 yuan to 73.25 yuan net.</p>
<p>Sluggish Silk Sales in Shanghai. Lately, the US dollar exchange rate has risen, and New York silk prices have weakened. Although there have been telegraphic transfers to Shanghai, the arrival prices are even lower, making it difficult for Chinese merchants to sell. Yesterday, only the French firm slightly covered short positions, with transactions including Xinfu and others bringing 20 bales of silk to the Shanghai factory, and prices remained stable.</p>
<h3 id="e269">Pingshui Green Tea Sales Active to the US <a href="#e269" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c269" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">269</a></h3>
<p>Sales of Huzhou Pingshui bulk green tea to the US are slightly active. Over 1,000 boxes have been agreed upon in the city, priced at 61 yuan, down three to four yuan from before. As for Luzhuang green tea, there were sporadic transactions for high-grade Chouxin, Zhenmei, and Zhucha yesterday. There are also rumors of the Russian Aid Association resuming purchases of Gongxi green tea and Qimen black tea, and selling prices are uniformly stable. However, there is no significant development in sales routes for ordinary Zhenmei. The source of supply from various regions is drying up, and the market seems to be unaffected.</p>
<h3 id="e270">Sugar Market: Coarse and White Sugar Slightly Rebound <a href="#e270" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c270" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">270</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market was stable as customs gold slightly rose and the Dutch exchange rate slightly decreased. The guild's pricing for 24 grade coarse white ordinary sugar was 21.58 yuan, up only three fen from before. There were no transactions for 20 grade medium white sugar. Dutch red PK Markings were each down five fen, at 16.75 yuan. Taikoo Sugar's B Marking initial pricing also lacked incoming or outgoing activity. The factory's refined white sugar was in short supply from Zhonghua and Guohua, and deliveries were suspended for many days. They resumed yesterday, with the top grade at 20.8 yuan, grade 1 at 20.6 yuan, grade 2 at 20.4 yuan, grade 3 at 20.2 yuan, and grade 4 at 20 yuan. The Chaozhou gang household opened with over 200 bags of Chao Qing, priced at 15.9 yuan to 15.6 yuan and 14.75 yuan for the next grade.</p>

<p>The prices for Longkou vermicelli have been slightly softer lately. They were once priced at 19.2 yuan, but sales have not been smooth. The market price is 19.2 yuan to 19.4 yuan for North specification and 18.6 yuan to 18.8 yuan for South specification.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the market conditions for wool and woolen goods showed great progress. Apart from the Chengdu gang reducing purchases, other gangs such as Chongqing, Jiangxi, Tianjin, Beiping, Qingdao, and inland gangs all started purchasing. Western clothing stores and hat workshops in this street also had large incoming purchases. The trading of various herringbone, striped, plaid, and patterned overcoating fabrics for autumn was very lively, with both retail and wholesale transactions. Hualun autumn overcoating fabric sold for 8.25 yuan, Yongle thick fabric for 7 yuan, white fabric for 6.25 yuan, Lianhua for 6.5 yuan, Gongji Kuoren herringbone for 7.25 yuan, Xiankang Xiaoren herringbone for 6.4 yuan, and Miye No. 2 goods for 4.85 yuan.</p>

Packing factories in this street have also been increasing purchases, so over 1,000 dan were offered in the market yesterday, and prices have been rising steadily. Each dan is estimated at 9.23 yuan or more. Recently, few overseas arrivals have been priced high, which has boosted the local market. The future market may continue to look good.</p>

<h3 id="e275">On Modern Literary and Artistic Trends <a href="#e275" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c275" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">275</a></h3>
<p>"Literature for life" and "Literature for art" are two major issues in modern literary and artistic trends. However, I believe that whether it is "for life" or "for art", all works must have vitality. Strong "vitality" is the activity of human "desires", and "competing desires" is the main element of artistic action. "Appetite" and "sexual desire" are the main elements for maintaining and releasing survival. Although humans have emotions, they cannot ignore food and reproduction and only talk about "aesthetic desire" or exclusively pursue artistic activities and create "literature for art." But neither can they be like animals, only pursuing reproduction and lacking emotional pursuit of beauty, and only talk about trivialities in life and create "literature for life." In fact, "literature for life" and "literature for art" are already forced terms. Life should have artistic impulses, if we do not ignore "aesthetic desire," one of the three major desires. From a broad perspective, "literature for life" can still be an acceptable term, because literature portrays life, and life is multifaceted (not only focusing on aesthetic emotions, but also taking into account eating and mating). Therefore, all literary works should have the vitality to express various human desires. This is just my opinion, and it is essential. As for the "ivory tower," "struggle in life," and other ideological claims, they should be interpreted separately, because they are related to social evolution and class changes.</p>
<p>I do not approve of those who live leisurely in an "ivory tower," but neither do I approve of "proletarian" individuals who shout empty slogans!</p>
<p>The proletariat can create genuine works of art that reflect their true lives to the world. But now, all we see are unrealistic and alienating slogans with propaganda. Similarly, right-wing writers only want to escape reality. However, this is a necessary phenomenon in today's chaotic society, a transitional stage. If left-wing writers embark on the right track, true works of art may emerge. However, we should be a little indifferent and not fall for these two kinds of tricks in the chaos. We cannot simply write about beautiful scenery, nor can we blindly deceive illiterate workers. Therefore, before we fully understand everything, we should adopt a "general" attitude to research and observe.</p>

<p>— Shi Ben</p>
<p>A Dark Scene of Society</p>
<p>"A Three-Year Village Head is as Poisonous as a Snake" 丨 The common people's fear of the village head is like that of snakes and scorpions, which has been fully exposed in this common saying. This is nothing more than a legacy of the poor social system in China! None of the village heads do not take advantage of their power to bully the people and exploit the villages. The ignorant and uneducated, pitiful common people are at the mercy of these fellows. They swallow their anger, dare to be angry but dare not speak out! Not to mention the word "resistance." Since the flag of the blue sky and white sun was raised high on the pole, all feudal titles in society were sent to their final rest and eliminated. The word "village head" was, of course, no exception, transforming into a "tax collector." But their [village heads] acts of taking advantage of their power to bully the people and exploit the villages have not disappeared due to the change of name! Village head, tax collector, is nothing more than a set of "changing the soup but not the medicine," a ridiculous trick.</p>
<p>Wang XX, the tax collector in X village, arrogantly relied on the power of the government to bully the ignorant people in the village, threatening them with benefits and instigating lawsuits, leaving the people in X village devastated and full of complaints! At that time, some slightly knowledgeable people felt the pain of being trampled by Tax Collector Wang to the extreme. His means of destruction and coercion were also extremely cruel. How could they continue to swallow their anger and endure injustice? Therefore, they jointly gathered more than twenty villagers and wrote an indictment listing Wang's great crimes of violating the law and harming the people, and went to the government to accuse him. But after the indictment entered the government office, their [villagers'] hearts became uneasy again, and their faces fully revealed their fear. It turned out that Tax Collector Wang had strong backing and great power. For the common people to sue him was like striking a stone with an egg! Lest "drawing a tiger but failing to resemble it and instead resembling a dog" resulted in "stirring up a hornet's nest," wouldn't that be inviting disaster upon themselves! After everyone thought it over, they all felt fearful and regretful for going to sue Tax Collector Wang.</p>
<p>Tax Collector Wang learned that the people of his jurisdiction were suing him and immediately ran to tell his only backing, Gentleman X.</p>
<p>Gentleman X said to him: "You don't need to panic. See what the wind is blowing." In Gentleman X's experienced tone, Tax Collector Wang's courage suddenly increased! A heart of "a guilty conscience" was greatly comforted.</p>
<p>This was probably the effect of Gentleman X's magical power. After the government received the people's indictment, it did not issue a summons to gather the defendant for trial, but casually sent the original indictment to Li XX, a county official who had been waiting for a position in the county government for a long time, for secret investigation and reply. Li XX understood that this was because the county magistrate remembered that he had been waiting for a position for a long time and was extremely panicked due to economic hardship, so he specially gave him a "profitable" matter to handle.</p>
<p>When Committee Member Li arrived at X Village, the first visiting card was sent to Gentleman X's residence.</p>
<p>It is said that Gentleman X hosted a dinner tonight, inviting Committee Member Li XX of the county government. When Committee Member Li was drunk and got up to bid farewell to Gentleman X, the air in Gentleman X's reception room suddenly became tense! The gas lamp hanging overhead also suddenly changed, and the pure white and dazzling light suddenly transformed into a dark and blurred light. At this time, on the large table in the room, there seemed to be two mysterious items arranged, one like a bank check, and also like a government document; and a stack of things like a prescription after being cured of illness, and also like banknotes that everyone loves. Beside them, two people were whispering to each other in private, their faces blurred, looking three parts like Gentleman X and Committee Member Li!</p>
<p>X days later, a piece of news was published in the X County People's Daily: "(X Village citizens XXX, etc., jointly sued X Tu tax collector Wang XX for violating the law and harming the people. After being secretly investigated by Li XX, who was appointed by the county government committee, it was reported that 'the accusations were found to be without factual basis.' Therefore, the county government has dismissed the lawsuit filed by the citizens, etc."</p>
<h3 id="e277">On Filial Piety <a href="#e277" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c277" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">277</a></h3>
<p>— Lie Huo</p>
<p>A few days ago, I discussed "rites." Now I am going to discuss "filial piety." It is not because I maliciously want to settle accounts with the Chinese people, but because I am unaccustomed to the fact that the old etiquette and teachings are collapsing, and there is no way to construct new ones during the current transitional period. The smoky atmosphere of "filial piety" is equally intolerable and equally in need of liquidation.</p>
<p>Needless to say, "filial piety" is another kind of national essence with rich color and fragrance. Since Zeng Shen, for thousands of years, it has been deeply engraved in the minds of the general public, and it has become the first step in "cultivating oneself." Because of this, it has the most powerful influence on human life. Nowadays, the old-fashioned people are still worshiping and prostrating, and even the fashionable figures in ties and suits, who are full of foreign air, are also trying to "be hygienic"? It's just that when they are down and out, they all like to talk coolly, and even go the way of "despising" it. However, once the bad luck is gone and good luck comes, and they are commanded by Macmac, they will also "have inexhaustible filial piety" (?). This is often done more on the outside and is most hypocritical on the inside.</p>
<p>Let's see what kind of filial piety is practiced by the general public now?</p>
<p>When parents are alive, the most common kind of "filial piety" is the provision of the mouth and body, which means that they should be served very thoughtfully in terms of material enjoyment. For example, in Shanghai, which lives in a temperate zone, there are no fresh vegetables in winter, so you may want to take a boat or car to the tropics to buy some back (you can also ask someone to bring them), roast them well, and offer them to the table of your strict father and loving mother, and respectfully persuade them to eat. This is "filial piety," and this will "spread your reputation, and everyone will admire it."</p>
<p>Secondly, the words and deeds of the strict father and loving mother, even if they are ugly to the point of stealing and selling prostitution, or like the current trend of being a traitor and selling out the motherland, should be followed only by the parents' orders, without adding any criticism, and the same filial piety can also win a "filial son" from the social people.</p>
<p>Naturally, these are still small aspects of "filial piety." The most important thing is to be filial to the point of "making a name and honoring parents" in the Three Character Classic. To "make a name" and "honor" them, you must abandon the "farming" and "business" and become the only [page break]</p>

<p>To the esteemed readers: This company exclusively manages Zhenhua Yonggu Paint Company's Flying Boat brand of various thick paints, magnetic paints, bright black paints, and improved gold paints. In order to expand, the prices are particularly restrained, the quality is particularly excellent, and the delivery is particularly fast. We have selected the 7th and 9th of this month to move to 53 Bailu Lane, Broadway Road, to continue business as usual. We would be grateful for your patronage (telephone 42895) 4373. Special Announcement. "scholars." In the past, in China, all scholars had some hope of becoming officials. Even if they couldn't, they might as well spend some money to "bribe" and "buy" their way in. Once they became officials, their reputation would surely spread far and wide, and their parents would be greatly honored. They had to bring out their strict father and loving mother anytime and anywhere, and call them "old lady" and "old master." This is said to be the most effective kind of "filial piety." Those who can do this are naturally the most outstanding "filial sons."</p>
<p>If, by chance, "Yaochi" urges and the parents suddenly pass away and ascend to immortality, then it is necessary to widely issue "obituaries" and "biographies," and it is also necessary to ask celebrities to write praises, and all of them must write "beautiful words." And they must be "deeply sinful." When writing the biography, they must be "incoherent." The female juniors, when handling the funeral, when the ritual officer shouts "begin mourning," they must "cry loudly," like playing mournful music, wave after wave. This is considered "sacrificing with etiquette." Then they need to "be in mourning for three years," and the masters have regulations that they cannot engage in wedding or other happy events. In this way, those who sleep underground will also praise the filial piety of their grandchildren.</p>
<p>We see, these, these, are how much pretense, hypocrisy, how much irrelevance to life, and how much defilement of the essence of "filial piety"! Just look at the disputes over inheritance, which often occur when the parents have just passed away, and then make a big fuss in court, and you can deduce it from this.</p>
<p>But we do not oppose "filial piety," but our understanding of "filial piety" is somewhat different. True "filial piety" and "filial sons" should be like this:</p>
<p>(1) In their youth, they should inherit and learn from their parents' good education and good life, and not play and be prodigal, so as to worry their parents.</p>
<p>(2) After adulthood, they should seek self-sufficiency and economic independence, and not rely on their parents' old-age property, and be a human being in society.</p>
<p>They should work hard in their careers, serve society, and seek welfare for the masses, so as to fulfill the meaning of life and repay their parents' hard work, and not do evil to society and cause harm to the human masses.</p>

<p>— Hou Ying</p>
<p>In a trance, suddenly an ancient city appeared before my eyes. The broad and long city walls, majestic and dangerous, also contained some magnificence. Although it was very far away, it already felt as tall as a small mountain. The tricolor national flag reflected the bright sunshine, fluttering in the wind above. There was no one with the slightest vitality, and the numb expression was like a living corpse. Their bodies were as weak as wax; their eyes were as small as beans; their will was as thin as paper; their blood was as cold as water; their spirits were as withered as grass. Alas! In the world, there is a nation that is still dreaming and has not awakened!</p>
<p>Suddenly, a team of soldiers came towards me. Their yellow military uniforms shone in the sunlight like a ball of fire. This ball of fire scorched the weak people, and they all retreated to both sides. I suspected that they were another nation. Sure enough, I recognized their sharp voices as the beasts on the jagged peaks outside the city. It was pitiful that the creatures in this ancient kingdom were drunk and dreaming, and they would all be swallowed alive one by one by this group of beasts! They carried guns with bayonets, proudly striding in neat steps. The snow-white bayonets still had traces of red blood on them. Under the loud abdominal sounds, I heard the groans of the nation in this ancient kingdom. They were like a scorching sun, making people afraid to look directly at them. They used the tips of their guns to drive the people in this ancient kingdom like people driving cattle and horses. They were simply the . . . . Dozens of withered corpses were hanging on the streets, and many compatriots were gathered below, gesticulating and praising! The conscience of this nation has been lost to such an extent that I feel sorrow and shame for them!</p>
<p>After walking past the branch, a big river lay across my path. On both sides of the river, there were many reeds growing, and the autumn wind blew, and they all fell with the wind. The river water was unusually turbid and stagnant, just like this lifeless nation. When I went closer, I found that it was blocked by a large amount of soot.</p>
<p>My heart was茫茫然 and it seemed like I had some feelings. I walked and didn't know how far I had gone. Suddenly, the sound of killing and fighting was transmitted to my ears by the gentle breeze. I raised my head and looked carefully and unexpectedly found that it was the same nation that was cruelly killing each other; then I saw the beasts on the jagged peaks laughing loudly! I sighed and turned around and walked out of the open city gate with no one guarding it. The remaining rays of the setting sun were shooting through the treetops, illuminating the mottled city walls, as if they were sighing and shedding tears there! At this time, something seemed to be getting more lively and energetic. I slowly took a step and walked forward, gradually realizing that there were many peaks hidden in the clouds and mist around the ancient city, and from time to time there were sharp roars coming from those peaks, and I knew that there were unusual beasts. I went forward again and saw the ancient city bricks, piled up with mottled spots, as if to indicate that it had supported a long history of four or five thousand years in this den of tigers and wolves; I naturally had respect in my heart for this great ancient country; although the open city gate without a single city guard made me a little surprised, it did not diminish my respect at all.</p>
<p>The city was very calm, so calm that it was beyond my expectations. The weeds that were taller than my head spread all over the land, and the moss at the foot of the wall was telling of its loneliness; I quietly walked forward alone, parting the thorny grass and humming a song in a low voice; "Could this be the second Babylon? Otherwise, why is it so desolate!"</p>
<p>After a while, I finally walked to a place with human habitation. However, the people were also strange. Whether they were working, talking, or walking, they were all very desolate; I looked around and felt that they were so contaminated that the essence of 'filial piety' was being struck. As long as you look at the disputes over inheritance, which often occur at the new death of the parents, and then make a big fuss in the court, you can extend it to him.</p>
<p>But we do not oppose "filial piety," but our understanding of "filial piety" is somewhat different. True "filial piety" and "filial sons" should be like this:</p>
<p>(1) In their youth, they should inherit and learn from their parents' good education and good life, and not play and be prodigal, so as to worry their parents.</p>

<p>— Shi Ben</p>
<p>Not long ago, the "Chunqiu" column of this newspaper published an article by Mr. X called "Words Under the Leaves," which was witty and unparalleled, and the wonderful words eased the mood. "Words Under the Leaves" are commonly called "Shrinking Rhymes." In Pudong and other places, the middle and lower classes are all capable of this. They often like to use "Shrinking Rhymes" to joke when working or resting. For example, if you want to take advantage of someone, you say, "You have to call me (City God)!" or "You are my (cigarette brand)!" etc. Often without thinking, they blurt out something funny. The other night, when I was cooling off, I talked to Mr. X, a tailor next door, about "Shrinking Rhymes." He told a story about "Shrinking Rhymes," which was quite amusing, so I recorded it and submitted it to this publication to make the readers laugh.</p>
<p>He said, "In the past, there was a certain person named A, who was quite humorous and knew the words under the leaves." One day, he and his companions were playing in a temple. He happened to see a beautiful young woman,盛裝豔服, coming to the temple to burn incense. He stepped forward to take a closer look and saw that although the young woman's appearance was beautiful, the pair of golden lotuses under her榴裙 were as big as a rough man! It was really a flaw in the beauty. So he said to his companion, "A 'cow head horse' (face), although 'killing to ask' (good), but those 'nail-hammering turns' (feet), so 'straight waist folds' (big), is really half a Guanyin!" The young woman heard it, understood that he was saying bad things about her, but did not say anything. After burning incense, she got into the sedan chair and left. Who knew that this young woman was the beloved concubine of the magistrate of this county? She went back and told her husband about A's humiliating words and cried to her husband. The magistrate was furious when he heard it and thought that A had intentionally insulted the official's family. He immediately ordered the bailiffs to go directly to the temple to arrest A. The magistrate personally interrogated him and said to A, "Since you are good at glib tongue and playing with words, this county will not punish you for the time being. I will give you a limit to say five 'true' words in 'Shrinking Rhymes.' If you say them correctly, I will release you. If you say them incorrectly, I will investigate you again." A heard it and thought that there was nothing difficult in this, so he quickly replied, "Ten thousand diseases one" (rhymes with true), "A piece of sky" (true), "Hu Da Tian" (rhymes with true), "Yuan Shi Tian" (rhymes with true). Who knew that there was still one, and he could not think of it after a hundred thoughts. So the magistrate ordered him to be thrown into prison, and he would be released after he had said five words. A cried and cried in prison, thinking day and night, but it was difficult to think of it. Later, his wife came to visit him in prison. The husband and wife met and cried together! A told how it started, how he was arrested, and how he could not get out of prison. When his wife heard it, she knew that the disaster was caused by teasing and joking, and it was really a fake thing that turned into a real thing. So she blurted out, "Why did it turn from fake to true?" Who knew that when A heard these words, he was overjoyed and shouted, "Good (turning from fake to)!" He had been thinking for a long time but could not think of a true word. Now he got it effortlessly in nothingness, so he immediately reported it to the magistrate and was released.</p>

<p>Random Notes from Hometown, Part 1</p>
<p>I haven't seen my hometown for a long time. Sitting in a rickshaw from the train station, I seemed to be nestled in my mother's arms, letting the rickshaw shake forward, making beautiful childhood dreams. Although there were many new buildings and changed streets, which were no longer as simple as when I left, I could see my hometown again, and I couldn't describe the emotions of joy and sorrow for a while.</p>
<p>The rickshaw was about to reach the gate of my house, and it was already twilight. The [tree] in front of the gate, waving its leafy claws, made the row of old houses even more desolate. The wheat field was no longer the same as before. A three- or five-year-old child was playing with something at the base of the tree, and an old woman in front of the low house was scolding him angrily. It was only when my rickshaw approached that I recognized that the old woman was A Niu's mother. She seemed to know that I was back, and said, "Young Master is really back!" Saying this, she called out to the child, "Hurry up and call your dad!"</p>
<p>I ordered the rickshaw to stop. I wanted to ask her who the child was, but the child had already led Zhi Niu's hand out of the house next door.</p>
<p>"Young Master is back. Xiao Niu, this is the landlord's young master." He held the child's hand, but the child slipped away to the base of the tree.</p>
<p>A Niu was our childhood friend. Catching sparrows, catching cicadas, we often argued over a small matter; as for crying with a face full of grievances and shouting for his mother, there were also times. Now that I have been away from my hometown for a few years, he has also taken up the hoe to cultivate his fields. You see, with a red and black face, bare chest, revealing the muscles he has trained from labor, and the pants rolled up to his thighs, compared with my 풍삼 comrade, and he also rented our small house, he seems to feel the disparity in our status, but I also seem to be very uncomfortable with his humble appearance. Starting a conversation, I said, "Is that your son?"</p>
<p>"Young Master is. He can't be seen!" He seemed to force a smile on his face, concealing the unnaturalness of his speech.</p>
<p>"Dad, a cicada." The child caught the animal at the base of the tree and happily showed it to his dad.</p>
<p>"Go to sleep, catching cicadas every day." A Niu scolded the child, and said with a smile, "Young Master, have you not eaten yet? I'll come over in a while."</p>
<p>"Come over and talk in a while." I said goodbye to the three of them and went to my own home.</p>
<p>That night, there was a dispute in the family. Although I was a dumb puppet for two hours, I was very unhappy about the family drama that was often staged over a bit of inheritance. I wanted to return to Shanghai that night, but I couldn't get away before my puppet work was over. (This matter is detailed in Part 2 of the Random Notes from Hometown)</p>
<p>Sleeping in the broken house like an ancient temple, I didn't sleep well in the middle of the night. I heard the wind blowing over the roof, and the rats squeaking in the corner of the house. Finally, A Niu's red and black face floated to my front, and he had been taken away by age, and he knew how to call "Young Master." Catching locusts, catching cicadas, it was already his son's era. If you talk about the story of him crying and telling his mother for a locust shell, A Niu doesn't know whether to cry or laugh? We are still not thirty years old, and the companions of the same era have already torn up such a deep gap, so decades later, the inheritance will cause disputes among the descendants.</p>
<p>I fell asleep before dawn, but A Niu's red and black face did not disappear from my dreams.</p>

<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>Act Two: The Group of Refugees</p>
<p>Voice: (Speaking loudly,) Everyone! Have you heard? They simply don't treat us like human beings! We think, before the Japanese soldiers even come, they retreat, leaving us common people outside the defense line, and we have to flee; we finally managed to escape to here, but they don't allow us to take the train. Isn't this too unreasonable? Everyone! Think about it, do they still treat us like human beings?</p>
<p>Crowd's excitement, calls.</p>
<p>Orderly: (Looking up .)</p>
<p>The police came. Fighting. The one said of arrested.</p>
<p>Young Master: Damn it, it's really getting out of hand, it's okay to beat a few to death.</p>
<p>Orderly: Young Master, they're here, the young ladies are here.</p>
<p>Young Master: Where? (Leaning over to look out the window.)</p>
<p>Orderly: Over there, isn't that the sedan car? Hey, drive over, here!</p>
<p>Young Master! You go down, hurry up, how can they hear you if you yell here? (The orderly responds and goes down.)</p>
<p>Aunt: (Running to the dining room.) They come so late.</p>
<p>Young Master: How do I know? We were so worried.</p>
<p>(Two young ladies come from the door on the right. Maid B follows, carrying a thermos and a small box.)</p>
<p>Miss: Quick, Li Ma, quickly find me a bottle of perfume. It's really making me stink.</p>
<p>Aunt: "Come over here!" What's wrong? Second young lady, why is there blood on your head?</p>
<p>Miss A: Don't mention it, it's simply making me angry. Li Ma, hurry up, bring the perfume.</p>
<p>Aunt! What exactly is going on? Second young lady. How about quickly find a doctor.</p>
<p>Miss B: It doesn't matter, I just have a little injury. Li Ma, tell them to carry that old man over here.</p>
<p>Li Ma: (To the door) They carried to the next door</p>
<p>Young Master: Hey, I knew there would be trouble.</p>
<p>(The driver and a rescue team carry in an injured old man. In the dining room. People all run over from next door.)</p>
<p>Miss B: Brother, tell them to put the policeman who hit me under guard.</p>
<p>Young Master: Okay, Defa, tell them to put the policeman under guard. But what exactly is going on?</p>
<p>Miss B: You and the driver should go together. (They go down)</p>
<p>Aunt: (To the rescuer.) Hey, you come and take a look at our second young lady first.</p>
<p>Rescuer: Okay, wait a while until I see if this old man will die.</p>
<p>Young Master: Are you listening? Tell you to look at our young lady. Rescuer: (Standing up from beside the old man, comes over, daring to be angry but not daring to speak, to treat the young lady's head.) It's nothing, just a little injury.</p>
<p>Miss B: I know I'm nothing. What about that old man, will he die?</p>
