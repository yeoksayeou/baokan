<h3 id="c38">歡迎馬可尼華 <a href="#c38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>發明無線電的鼻祖馬可尼Ｍarconi此次來華游歷今日將由南京抵滬我們對於這位大有貢獻於人類文化的科學家。表示極誠地歡迎。現在把他。</p>
<p>榮譽的生平和他的成功。介紹如次。</p>
<p>馬可尼是意大利。人一八七四年四月二十五日生於意大利的波羅格那市。今年六十歳。他幼年在萊行肄業。爲名教授羅沙的高足。嗣後入波羅格那大學。從這時起他就從事研究無線電。</p>
<p>馬可尼初次的成功。算是在一八九七年英國短距離的試騐。此後他的幾個最榮譽　的最可紀念的時期。便是一八九九年。英法間開始無線電傳信。一九零一年。大西洋兩岸之初次通信。一九零二年。英國與美國加拿大間的直接通信。一九零四年。船中日報的創辦。使海洋中的旅客。每日能得到大陸的新聞。一九一零年。愛爾蘭與阿根廷間的通信。（五千六百英里）一九三零年。在意大利幾内亞港中「電氣」號船中直接與澳洲通無線電話復又利用無線電的電波燃着澳洲西德内城中電氣展覽會内的電燈。他生平最得意的發明。就是眞空管。從這一利器他獲得了無窮的秘奥。他時常感覺他的現在的試騐室不夠用了。他希望從這地球擴大到全宇宙。供他做試騐能與其他的星球通訊。</p>
<p>今日我們中國的科學知識。眞是太落後了。我國現在最需要的人才。便是科學家。可是科學的前程是無限量的。等待我們青年科學家的努力的機會。比馬可尼努力的機會更多。祇要我們青年科學家。不斷地精心試騐。馬可尼有一句名言。「我願意告訴諸位。倘使諸位能夠盡心竭力的幹一件事。便是一定可以成功的。」希望我國青年們都能牢記着。</p>
<p>一個科學家努力一種發明。果然必須依賴他的先進者給他遺留下的偉業。但是現代的大發明家。同樣亦需要一輩青年承繼他的偉大的成功。更進一步。爲人類文化開闢一個新天地。我們今天歡迎馬可尼。希望我們的青年科學家。都能以馬可尼發明無線電的精神來承繼他的偉業。爲人類造福。</p>
<p>科學是没有國籍的。科學家的貢獻。是遍及全人類的。所以我們今日歡迎馬可尼。比任何各國的外賓更爲熱烈。我們敬祝馬可尼的事業萬歳。</p>

<p>（倫敦）　據自治領大臣湯姆士今日午後在下院所發之言論觀之、英政府今不欲以哀的美敦書致南愛自由邦、故雙方圓滿解决之門户現仍開啓也、本日議員席及旁聽席皆爲人滿、自由邦高等委員杜蘭蒂及南斐高等委員華特亦均列席、湯姆士本日釋明英政府不欲應南愛自由邦之請告以對南愛宣布共和將取何種態度之理由、首先宣讀南愛行政主席伐勒拉氏之來文、内言湯姆士於十一月十四日在下院發言、請衆注意自由邦議會所提出之三議案、實與英愛條約相抵觸、並表示英政府希望自由邦仍爲英帝國之一份子、及自願接受其責任並享受其特惠、伐勒拉於是加以批駁、謂愛爾蘭人民從末願爲英帝國之一部份、其與英國及英帝國聯合者從未出於自願、無時不欲維持其獨成一國之權利、其以任何形式屈服於英國治權下者、則以處於優勢實力之壓迫下有以致之、非其本願也、一九二一年之英愛條約、並未使愛爾蘭態度發生根本變化、愛爾蘭人民亦未以此爲英愛關係之最後解决、或認此給予英國以干涉愛爾蘭憲法發展之權利、自由邦政府就十一月十四日湯姆士所發之言論推想之、　英政府現亦知强迫聯合之害、而可不以愛爾蘭與英帝國脫離之决議爲戰爭或他種侵略行爲之理由、英政府此種態度、應於直接文告中形成之云、</p>

<p>藝術學院初稱北京美術學校、於民國七年四月開辦、分中等高等兩部、十一年六月改稱北京美術專科學校、十四年三月停辦、十五年重行開辦、改稱藝術專門學校、十七年改稱國立北平大學藝術學院、分設六系、卽中國畫系、西洋畫系、實用美藝系、建築系、音樂系、及戲劇系、此爲該院最發達之時期、嗣後各系教授意見分歧、學生黨派林立、驅逐院長徐悲鴻毆打秘書蔣亞蘧、教部以藝院爲反動分子之巢穴目之、於是訓令平大將藝院結束、經平大當局之力爭、改爲逐年結束今年教育部部長易人、王世杰榮任爲部長、到任未久、卽今飭藝院停辦、「逐年結束」之口號宣告取消、學業尚未成熟之學生、教部令藝院發給專修科二年或三年畢業證書、經平大代理校長徐誦明之斡旋、始允一部分學生石曉喗女士等轉學、並令藝院即行停辦、清理教職員積欠、最近教部因藝院結束竣事、呈請行政院將藝院改辦國立北平藝術專科學校、先成立籌備處、聘請嚴智開爲主任、此爲藝院改專之經過、至於改專之詳細辦法、刻尚未公佈、</p>

<p>據劉教授談稱、北平大學經費、非無辦法、當朱家驊長教部時代、本擬結束藝術學院、結束後、將該院全部分經費撥充北平大學、補充農工醫等學院、經平大前校長沈尹默及藝院前院長楊仲子力爭、朱允逐年結束、俟結束後、改組爲專科學校、以一部分經費補助農工醫等學院、其餘一部份經費充藝術專科學之用、今年王世杰長教部、忽於暑假期内發出整頓平大令、謂藝術學院早經令飭停辦、本年應卽結束、其實以前教部並未令飭停辦、僅令飭逐年結束、平大固奉部令結束、並爲藝院學生設法轉學此層糾紛遂漸趨平息、現藝院將結束完竣、根據教育部歷年部令、藝院結束後、改組爲專科學校應撥一部分經費移作平大農工商醫各學院設備之用、其餘部分經費撥予藝術專科學校、但王部長改變方針、將藝院全部分經費劃爲藝術專科學校、平大農工商醫各學院分文不能增加、僅明年審計部審核經費、設法救濟平大爲名、實則等於發出不兌現之空頭支票一張、無濟於事、藝院經費原爲每月一萬元、其中補助平大附屬高中三百元、平大校長辦公處一百五十元、共計抽出四百五十元、藝院每月實領經費九千五百五十元、現將藝院全部分經費撥充藝術專科學校、在藝專方面、經費頗爲充足、在平大方面、更難打破僵局、徐校長（誦明）辭職、固爲平大前途之不利、而農工醫商四學院目前無法謀開展、女法兩學院將來亦未嘗無問題、至於高中明年暑假後是否存在、此刻不能預言、因教部本令飭今年結束高中、經平大代理校長徐誦明以去就力爭、教部始允改爲明年結束、此種問題尚屬懸案云、（五日瑾）</p>

<p>上月三十日倫敦電，日本競爭不公平之方法，巳引起英國下議院中劇烈之攻擊，商務部大巨任錫曼氏，在下院演說，對於日本貨品之冒用英貨名目，英國商標，大致憤慨之詞。任氏謂：世界無論何國政府，均有積極設法取締此種無恥行爲之必要。故英國政府在取得確實之證據後，即應不避情面，向日本政府提出正式之抗議。</p>
<p>我國人讀此一段新聞，試閉目一思，作何感想？日人之無恥行爲，施之於我國非一日矣。明明來自日本，而標明造自德國或英美等國，明明爲日貨，而詐稱國產。此種伎倆，在明眼人固一望而知，可憐多數國人，爲之朦蔽。即此冒牌一項，一年中奪我國貨之銷路，其數亦足驚人。雖然，此種無恥行爲，記者認爲不必責人，應先自責。蓋惟其有無恥之國人，然後日人始敢行此無恥之伎倆，舉國之中，一般爲虎作倀，利欲薰心者，固大有人在。謚之爲無恥之國人，尚屬恕詞。讓者疑余言乎？明明購買日紗，而偏稱國產，明明購買日布，而詐爲自識。以偷天換日之工夫，在暮夜中作改頭換面之勾當，人之無良，一至於此。顧彼在社會上以商人自命，自若也；用國貨牌子，來販日貨，自若也；裝少數之機，裝點門面，陳倉暗渡，自若也；人謂國中最墮落者，莫若上海之社會。蓋由上海人之利心太重，罔顧一切致之。護諤聲君謂：「現在的人，面皮日厚，非當面加以懲創，不能拆穿其假面具」。此語極能覷透上海社會之心理。記者爲此言，明知得罪於人，顧本良心所驅使，不能不言，言之而希望於讀者二：</p>
<p>（一）從今以後，大家來注意此無恥行爲，不再爲此無恥行爲所欺騙。</p>
<p>（二）從今以後，大家來破除情面，任何知親好友，苟使用此無恥行爲者，當　　面忠告而訓賣之，訓斥不聽，與衆共絶之，共棄之。迸諸四夷，不與同中國。顧尚欲作爲一般販賣劣貨者，作最後之忠告曰：天下職業甚多，可以經營而獲利之事業亦甚多，何必喪其良心，冒天下之不韙，作此行險僥倖，於人不利，於國有損之事。放下屠刀，立地成佛。人生社會間，至多不過百年，還是多作些對得起人家的事，不失爲一個堂堂正正清清白白的人。</p>

<p>— 張孟昭</p>
<p>我讀本刋黄影呆君的「我們應怎樣到鄉村去提倡國貨」一文後覺得黄君所說的，確中時弊，但是我還有「關於怎樣到鄉村去提倡國貨」的一些補充意見，寫在下面。</p>
<p>我在夏天，曾因事到我們無錫的膠山鄉鎭去跑一趟，他們和她們的所謂神聖者農夫農婦，什麽多愛好上海的新裝飾品，新花樣，嘴裏不斷的稱羨着，鄉鎭上有一家富户，有着無線電，和留聲機，他們田裏工作完畢之後，會很驕笑的跑去聽，聚攏了一大堆人，聽到一支很幽美的曲子，她們也會哼二句的唱起來，所以不必一定到鄉村去嘵音　口的宣講，因爲實地宣講，要自己會農民化，和入他們的隊裏宣傳提倡國貨，纔會生效，不然的話，一本正經，擺着架子去演講，决計没有效力的，我們不妨利用神通廣大的無線電，灌輸國貨新聞篇的唱曲，深印到他們的腦海裏去，鄉村合作社，置辦一具，也是輕而易舉，雖說無線電還没有代用的國貨，然而能夠因一具無線電，制止大批東西洋貨的傾銷和驚人的利權外溢，總覺合算得多，在愛國心最堅固的日本人，政府尚且宣布還有自己不能創造的非國貨幾十種，只得一用，其次：是提倡國貨的名人，應該去和國產影片公司當局商量多攝置「洋貨壓迫的痛苦，和人民樂用國貨，救國家的劇本演出」，來到内地的鄉村去開映，没有電流的鄉村，就利用警覺的圖畫去合作，發行一種日用國貨代價劵，鄉人要錢的不妨拿錢，要買些日用品的，不妨搭拿些「日用國貨代價劵」照這樣努力地去提倡，有計劃的去實行，我相信國貨在鄉村，一定會掃蕩舶來品，大家樂用國貨了！質之讀者，以爲如何？</p>

<p>— 方悴農</p>
<p>－獻給提倡國貨與服務農村事業者－</p>
<p>我們大家都知道中國是立脚在農村上，無疑地提倡國貨也應該着重在廣博的農村裏。况且都知道農村經濟破產的最大原因，是外國經濟的侵略，而經濟侵略不又是外來洋貨的充斥市塲；以致農人也抛了土貨去購買洋貨嗎？</p>
<p>只要我們睜開眼睛，在農村裏到處都可以看見農人也用洋貨，像小商店，小販欄裏大半佔着煤油，紙烟……農村婦女也大都多穿花洋紗，花貢呢……一類的洋貨。總之，現在農村己顯然破產了，但在裏面還是穿洋布，用洋貨，甚至於還要吃洋米……這種不景氣的現象，照理不應該在一九三三的國貨年後再發生－而且更不應在復興農村下再發現－我以爲目下提倡國貨救濟農村，要從二方面去進行。</p>
<p>第一是提倡農人應用國貨；因爲農村人民知識缺乏，没有國家觀念，而自私心重貪圖目前小利；所以易受商人愚弄購用洋貨。加之目下在農村中購買國貨機會缺乏。－－所以提倡國貨亦很重要，但在農村與都市不問，倘藉廣告宣傳，刻得效甚微。我以爲在農村中提倡</p>
<h3 id="c280">貢獻話二十七國之一究竟如何 <a href="#c280" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e280" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">280</a></h3>
<p>— 仰莽</p>
<p>可憐抵制虚張勢日貨如潮滾滾來據十一月三十日日本商工省貿易局的調查，謂世界各國，對於日貨的輸入防止，目下更形猛烈，巳達二十七國之多。其防止手段，都是用關稅提高，輸入許可，匯兌管理，和傾銷稅等政策，這樣看來，在全世界中，抵制日貨的，居然己有二十七國，可憐的中國，居然在二十七國中也占其一。顧在事實上，中國的抵制日貨，恐僅僅是做幾篇文章，開幾次會，擬幾個條例，就算了事。何嘗有眞個凖備，整個計劃，和眞心誠意雷厲風行去快幹實幹硬幹呢？記者看了這段新聞，着實有些慚愧，有些難過。今年枉做了一個國貨年，却不料反造成日貨暢銷的機會，讀者亦知華北地方到處爲日貨世界乎？亦知上海市塲到處有日貨偷渡乎？亦知長江各埠到處有日貨活動乎？人家則壁壘森嚴，銜枚疾走，抵制日貨，巳獲成效。我則虚張聲勢，空有其表，結果，則愈唱抵制，而日貨愈猖獗。本報五日載國際貿易局發表本年一月至十月各國進口之脂粉香水價格，已達一百三十九萬八千六百六十四元。除美國法國英國外，又以日本爲最多，問日報載，日本上星期由青島大連方面運到鮮鹹日魚，數達二萬一千餘件，總值五十餘萬元，試問此爲抵制日貨乎？抑暢銷日貨乎？現象如此，可爲慨歎。彼歐洲各國，苟覺日貨傾銷，或則大聲疾呼，促人注意，或則積極防維，予以限制。意相墨索里尼目擊日本棉織品之壟斷亞洲市場，與逺東人造絲之侵入意大利，早己聯絡德俄，設法抵制。起視我國，則政府官吏，忙於内戰，社會工商，救死不遑，於是日人利誘於外，好商勾結於内，而偌大中國，竟爲日貨活躍之大市塲，每一念及，疇不痛心。最近張公權氏，考察西北歸，談及山西人之鄉土觀念，尤甚於愛國，山西人之購貨惟一目的，在用自給自足之山西貨，苟不足，始用中國貨，再不足，乃用舶來品。一切均須受制於經濟統制局，即以紙烟而論，牌照之給發，極爲嚴格，凡商人之領照者，祇准販賣山西紙烟，上海紙烟與英美紙烟，則不易領得，其壁壘之嚴，可見一斑。以我所見，山西人之辦法，雖囿於地域之見，然其抵制外貨之勇氣，至可佩服。其次爲廣西省之產業統制，抱定進口貨不得超過出口貨之方針，其勇氣亦殊可敬。中國人苟能人人如此，地地如此，則不必言抵制日貨，而日貨自無從而入。不然，則忝列二十七國之一，空負抵制日貨之名，未來之國貨界，更不堪問聞矣。</p>
<p>國貨，約有下列諸點：</p>
<p>一·要有「以身作則」的青年男女，去指導農人樂用國貨。</p>
<p>二，用巡廻的國貨展覽會，搜集各種農人需要的國貨，於秋收後在農村中巡廻展覽。</p>
<p>三，演放關於國貨的幻燈，電影……以引起講買國貨興趣。</p>
<p>四，在當地的農教館，小學或改進會内設一小規模之國貨標本陳列室，俾農人認識國貨。</p>
<p>五，廠家與當地合作社商洽，批發或借貸給農人。</p>
<p>六，批發小販，使在農村中行銷。</p>
<p>第二利用農村原有生產，以補充國貨之不足。我們知道從前農村中向來男耕女織不求外力，穿的土布，用的土貨，點燈則青油，菜油，蠟燭，做衣則自織土布，吸烟則自種毛烟……所以我們現在除了提倡國貨以外，應該利用原有之生產加以改良，以補救國貨之不足及經濟之損失。並與廠家合作，利用農村婦女的低廉工資做手工藝（如糊火柴盒等），提倡栽培除蟲菊，薄荷，金針，棉花……以補助製造國貨之原料及增加農村生產之收入。於提倡國貨救濟農村上亦裨益不鮮。</p>
<p>總之，在這農村經濟破產，洋貨充斥市塲的目下中國，來提倡國貨。我以爲上面這二點是的確不可疏忽的事；况且國貨與農村又有密切的關係，可說是國貨完全是依賴在農村上，不論是他的原料及銷路，都要以農村爲大本營。——過去國貨之所以不能發達，與專偏重在城市方面運動，亦大有關係吧！今後提倡國貨於救濟農村應當携手共策進行。換句話說：廠家與農村服務人員應該切實聯絡：以資國貨原料的供給與出品的銷路有所調濟！</p>
<p>末了！盼望着提倡國貨與救濟農村的同志們注意及之；並賜我一個教正－</p>

<h3 id="c281">提倡國貨當從自己做起 <a href="#c281" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e281" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">281</a></h3>
<p>— 凌白</p>
<p>似乎有些過火，可是我敢負責聲明，這是千眞萬確的事實。</p>
<p>我們這裏是全國行政曁學術研究的最高機關。因此這裏的中高級職員，都是國内一等一的學者志土，即使是一般助理員練習員等等，也没有不方帽子上鍍過一層金的－學士門。</p>
<p>我們研究的事項，據說是：（一）如何發展國民經濟，（二）如何復興農村，（三）如何增加國貨生產，（四）如何抵制洋貨輸入，以及（五）如何充實民力，（六）如何提高人民生活……等一類的「國計民生」問題。</p>
<p>然而不幸得很！我們的鄉下老百姓，早巳胼手胝足，挖枯了他們的勞力，榨乾了他們的汗血，更不幸得很，他們終歳勤勞，換來的却是衣不蔽體，食不果腹，即最低的水凖下的生活，也幾難維持。没有充分的生產資金，没有合度的生活資料，他們吃的是鄉下黄糙米，着的是鄉下老土布，用的是鄉下手工業製品。他們没有更好的購買力，消費力，如何增加生產？他們也老早巳在吃着國貨，用着國貨了。</p>
<p>有市民會，才是我們提倡國貨運動的對象。</p>
<p>可是在我們這個全國行政曁學術研究的最高機關的許多年青的學者志士們，他們服務的是國家公共機關，掙的是老百姓血汗的賦稅，研究的是國計民生，談的寫的都是些救國的讜言偉諭，然而事實又多麽矛盾喲！他們！百分之八十八是穿着嶄新筆挺的洋料西服，住着水泥鋼骨高聳的洋縷，吃的是咖啡，麵包，威士忌，白蘭地，用的是西式傢具飾物，他們盤踞着社會的上層，購買力大，消費力大，然而他們却忘了「國家興亡，匹夫有責」！</p>
<p>這又何足驚異？呈現在我們社會上的不都是如此這般一模一樣的很尋常而又普遍的事實麽？這裏又何嘗特殊！可是要談救國要談復興農村，發展國民經濟，我們第一就得提倡國貨，從事國貨運動，這是每一個同胸的義務也是每一個同胸的責任。</p>
<p>－噫！國難方殷，但願同胞們警愓些吧！莫忘了「提倡國貨，當從自己做起」。－這是我們唯一的信條。</p>
<h3 id="c282">到農村去提倡國貨的商 <a href="#c282" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e282" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">282</a></h3>
<p>— 榷巴玲</p>
<p>在上二期的本刋中，有關於「到農村去提倡國貨」的文字，讀之，使我發生無限之感想。</p>
<p>我之所謂感想，并不是說農村中不應該去宣傳提倡國貨，澈底講起來，國貨之敵人，并不在鄉村，而在都市，并不在胼手胝足的農人，而在一般自號爲摩登的智識階級，這不是言之過甚，却是有事實爲證。</p>
<p>余戚某君，農人也，其子女（姑隱其名）在鄉間讀書時，一切衣服，完全土布，及長，就讀於市，一切衣服，完全用品均厭惡土貨，而羨慕洋貨矣，每年耗費，亦頗不貲，某君偶言及此，當有無限之感慨在焉。</p>
<p>上述一事，非余故意杜撰，實爲千眞萬確之事，今之所以欲提出於本刋者。實欲借此證明提倡國貨之重心，十之三在農村，十之七仍在繁華之都市，智識的階級。</p>
<p>所以，我認爲提倡國貨，鄉村雖不放棄，而都市固未可輕視，要知衣洋貨而用外物者，固一般摩登之人物，而鮮少純樸之鄉人。這一點，我想，大家都不會否認吧。</p>
<p>綜而言之，歸根一句話，提倡國貨須舉國上下，都市農村，一致努力才對，一部份的提倡，一地方的努力，仍然是没有什麽大效果的。</p>

<p>多謝中國的許多太太奶奶小姐，在這國貨年中，從一月到十月，消耗了外國的化妝品香水脂粉有一百三十九萬八千六百六十四元。這筆費眞是可觀，可惜鄉下女子，没福報效。吾敢說，報效的都是都市裏的太太奶奶小姐，你們要好看，要漂亮，要博得人家歡喜，屏中國貨不買，去買外國貨，斷送了這筆巨欵，多謝你們把丈夫辛苦得來的錢，白白的化去，結果又給人家多造了許多槍砲和飛機兵艦，唉中國的太太奶奶小姐，都市中的太太奶奶小姐。受過高深教育的太太奶奶小姐。</p>
<p>該死的洋化朋友</p>
<p>吸烟要吸外國烟，喝酒要喝外國酒，穿衣還要穿外國呢絨和外國綢緞，頭髮也燙卷了，可惜一雙眼睛，没有法子染緑。唉，該死的洋化朋友，你何必稱中國人，你索性直直爽爽歸化了外國，做一個十足的洋奴好了。反正中國人是很多，不少你們醉心洋化的不肖分子。</p>

<p>國貨專論</p>
<h3 id="c284">主婦提倡國貨的各方面 <a href="#c284" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e284" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">284</a></h3>
<p>— 俞思思</p>
<p>女青年會主辦的國貨展覽會馬上要開幕了。誠如仰葊先生所說的，提倡國貨成功與否，都在女太太們的手裏，過去提倡國貨運動之所以失敗，便是爲着提倡者没有注意到女太太們的身上去，如今竟以奶奶太太們爲主幹的女青年會，自動的起來舉行國貨展覽會了，那是樁怎樣可欣喜的事呵，她們展覽的貨物是以家庭爲對象的，而且又依照一般家庭的經濟狀况而分爲三個等級，確是很新頴而合乎事實的需要，向來不服用國貨或者不知國貨爲何物的主婦們，如果去參觀之後，對於國貨定有一個明晰的認識了。决不可參觀之後忘却，應該從兹永逺服用國貨。但，主婦們應該怎樣去提倡國貨呢？展覽會中雖己分門别類的把許多國貨陳列在那邊，可供太太奶奶們作參考，但，此外我覺得還有幾點也很值得太太奶奶加以注意的。</p>
<p>約束丈夫</p>
<p>誰也不容否認，約束男子們最有力量的，莫過於他們底妻子。男子們時常憑着一己的意志，做盲目的舉動，别人很難勸他回心，祇有嬌妻才可設法使他回心。很多男子都熱中於舶來品，做他底妻的，亟應施展她底使命，努力約束他和盛督他，不准他去買絲毫的外國貨。最好在他買了外國貨返來的時候便向他撤一回嬌，給他一回「閉門羹」，這樣不合作的結果，下次他便不會再去買那些「殺千刀」的舶來品了。仰葊先生說：倘使丈夫買了洋貨，做夫人的可以實行罷工，或提出離婚這是最好的方法。</p>
<p>勸導兒女</p>
<p>主婦和自己兒女接觸的機會較多，給與他們的影響也最多，主婦如果服用國貨的，兒女們受着日久的印象後，也自然會嫉惡外國貨了，否則的話，天眞爛漫的兒童們也必喜用洋貨，將來國貨前途有無限之影響的。所以一個賢良的主母，必然她需要把提倡國貨的意義，時常勸導給兒女聽，使他們天眞的靈魂中，留下一個國貨的觀念：同時自身對於消耗的物品，當然更需要用國貨，以身作則。</p>
<p>約束僕人</p>
<p>僕婦的知識很淺薄，頭腦很簡單，根本不知愛國和服用國貨爲何物，主人命令她們去買東西的時候，她們時常會去買外貨的。所以主婦應該時常約束她們和指導她們去買國貨。</p>
<p>認識國貨</p>
<p>還有一點也是很重要的，那便是主婦要加意認識國貨。因爲現在奸商們知道仇貨難以推銷，時常把外貨改頭換面，冒充國貨，做的手法高妙，神通廣大。熱心國貨的主婦們，一不小心把這些東西買來，未免太負提提倡和愛國的誠心了。所以主婦們對於國貨用品的商標牌號和廠名要留心記牢才可不致受奸商們的欺騙。</p>
<p>國貨雜談</p>
<h3 id="c285">提倡國貨從何做起 <a href="#c285" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e285" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">285</a></h3>
<p>— 何碧</p>
<p>提倡國貨，「要從兒童做起」：這話是很多人在說，同時也有很多人附和着；然而將如何做法呢？回答是這樣，說，應該請一般父母們注意，要非國貨不給小孩子服用，並且父母自己也絶對不用外貨，以身作則地做，使小孩子有愛好國貨，仇視敵貨的心理。那末這職任全在父母的上，提倡國貨的擔子，就肩於父母身上先。</p>
<p>另一說是提倡國貨「要從小學教師做起」，因爲小學教師一個人接觸很多孩子，同時還做了孩子的標準，許多許多的孩子都跟了老師用國貨，那末國貨的應用就可觀了！這幾點，的確是推消國貨的大道。</p>
<p>不過，另一面還得祈望於創造，因爲我們要求國貨善遍的來替代外貨，使得大家肉眼接觸的都是國貨，那末無須檢别，凡一切貨物都是國產，這是就容易採用，國貨的消路也好了。－因爲有時還有錯買了的苦事呢？目前同胞採用國貨的成績是高出了以前不少了，若不信，那只須到南京路國貨商塲去跑一轉，就得證明。所以我說提倡國貨「要從創造國貨做起」此外，「國貨大减價」，也是絶妙方法。</p>
<p>從上面說下來，只要國貨能夠與外貨相等，國貨不要比外貨貴，那末不久就會人人用國貨，國貨遍消在國人手中，今年的國貨年，也得名副其實了。</p>
<p>末後，我計算到國貨年只有整個的一月了，一月過後，又是第一個國貨年，然而祈望國貨廠家要繼續的創造，繼續的暢消。</p>

<h3 id="c286">關於國貨的廣告術 <a href="#c286" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e286" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">286</a></h3>
<p>— 全甲</p>
<p>要振興國貨，廣告確也是一種必需的工具，但是在國貨努力的初步，對於廣告，應該怎樣的樸實化呀！現在我提出幾種意見來，貢獻給國貨界中。</p>
<p>（一）每見國貨公司大減價時間内，把廣告紙貼得滿墻都是，這樣看的人反不注意了。何况徒耗紙料，無補於事。我提議還是在規定的廣告欄裏貼，或者把這筆其餘的錢，買國貨品，出懸賞徵文題，擇尤奬給，不是一舉而二得嗎？</p>
<p>（二）關於國貨公司的廣告，我以爲尤其說如何如何好，甚至於說與舶來品無異，還是說明牠眞實的缺點優點，與舶來品比較好，因爲前者不過欺騙而巳，後者却增進國人眞心的同情。</p>
<p>（三）此外廣告最好稍注重於内地，因爲帝國主義的刀口伸進了内地，人民所見所聞，不過是外國人的反宣傳。所以爲大多數民衆知道國貨起見，這是最重要的條件。此次中華產銷合作恊會創立各地國貨公司，就是這個意思。</p>
<p>最後，我們國貨事業的廣告術，急需用經濟化，效力化合理化的廣告。否則還是省下浪費的錢，注意於出品的優良問題吧！</p>

<p>在國貨年的國貨工廠所負底使命，不僅是供給國内所需要的商品，並且是抵抗洋貨的先鋒軍，所以他一方面喚起國人服用國貨，另一方面努力於出品上的改進和售價的削減爲必要的條件，可是在目前的許多工廠，暫圖一時的獲利而忽略了技術方面的進取，以苟且的心理而偏重於營業上的發展，甚或於同業之中以鈎心鬥角爲能事的傾軌競爭，這樣恐怕在洋貨未及抵制殆盡之前，而工廠本身就發生了動摇，以致崩潰，整個的國貨事業也因此而有了阻碍，前途的危險眞是不堪設想！</p>
<p>誠然，工廠的主要　的是以營業約發展爲基點，但是製造方面如果没有良好的成績，縱然竭力地推廣宣揚盛銷於一時，結果失改是必然的，所以品質的優劣也是將來的成敗，這是無可否認底事實，</p>
<p>出品優越旣爲首要，同時管理貨品也須完密，假使一個貨品管理員他没有靈敏的頭腦，和凖確的計算，那末在收發的時候，訛誤是不能避免的，譬如客户漲貨裝運外埠，管理員因一時的疏忽而誤配花色或數量，及運至外埠而方始發現，則在顧客方面犧牲運費延誤營業，而工廠方面信用也生破裂，以致糾紛叢生，其影響於廠譽營業者恐也非在出品優劣問題之下吧！</p>
<p>所以一個工廠貨品管理員對於職務上的精密週到，是於業務上的進展有很大的助力，他除了貨品堆置的整潔，和收發檢點的凖確，支配調劑的迅速，包紥裝配的堅固，還要具有忍耐的性格，敏捷的思想，耐勞刻苦的精神，這是每一個國貨工廠的貨品管理員所應有的認識啊！</p>

<p>說來慚愧，一釘之　，我國尚不能自給，需仰望舶來，大量金錢，流到外國去，這是一樁多麽可恥的事－去年海關報告：除外人在我國設廠製造者外，進口圓釘—俗名洋釘—達二十四萬桶（每桶百磅）之多，國人們，注意吧！勿以爲一個銅板可買幾枚而輕視之。</p>
<p>中國製釘公司創立於二十年十一月，進步之速，爲普通廠所不及，大有參觀價值，我是工業界混飯吃一份子，各廠都喜歡去跑跑，聞此消息，欣　往楊樹浦福寗路該廠參觀。經友人的介紹，和當局的允許，即隨引導者至工場。機聲隆隆，工作異常緊張，確富於生氣之廠也，據引導者說：經理錢祥標君留美多年，專攻機械，對於製釘，尤有深切之研究。歸乃與其友人葉柏蔭君等組織斯廠。苦心經營，始有此成績。</p>
<p>設備方面，現有製釘機十六部，每十小時可出大小圓釘七八十桶，所出之釘，有下面的優點：「（一）釘頭圓整，厚薄適宜：（一）釘齒深切，牢不可拔：（三）釘身正直，不撓不屈，（四）釘尖鋒銳，容易入木。除製釘外，尚備拉絲機八問拉粗爲細，以備製釘之用，因之成本大可减輕。文件紙夾機一部，以後我們有國貨紙夾用，不須再仰給舶來品。聞中國國貨公司代售，每盒價一角左右。有刺鉛絲機一部，聞該廠現正積極擴充，尚有多種鐵絲製造品將陸續出世，以應社會需要，蓋該廠英文名ＷireＰroductＣo不限於製造圓釘一種。</p>
<p>在這國貨年頭，有此優良國貨應世，確是值得讚美的，故樂意爲之介紹。</p>

<p>— 甘純權</p>
<p>中國實業機器製造廠，設於上海小沙渡路澳門路口，論其沿革，歷來係屬商務印書館製造部之一部份營業，論其營業種類，專造舒式華文打字機，其間由華東廠而大東廠，而實業廠，幾經擴充製造，最近自一二八後，定名爲中國實業機器製造廠，由前商務印書館華文打字部主任宋明德君擔任經理，迭經宋君蓋籌碩劃，出品精益求精，營業異常發達·今由商務印書館特約，定造華文打字機爲大宗出品，此外兼造印刷機，儀器，火爐，案頭日曆等品，亦頗受社會歡迎，記者昨承宋君專函上海戰業指舉所，　往參　，　　行者有中華國貨指導所主任倪拜言君，兹就參觀所得·寫實以告　心　　者。</p>
<p>華文打字權有關文化事業，可代書寫之勢旣省時間，又易閱看，應用至廣，係於民國八年經舒展東君創造，厥功甚偉，每機一架，其有大小機件四百五十二件之多，因機件之精密，製造極爲認眞，按大部份機件用機器製造，如果機器造成之機件，認爲不甚凖確，即將該機件運入鉗工部，用精細之手工，使其十分凖確，合於應用，兹將該廠製造華文打字機部份設備之大者，陳述於下。</p>
<p>（甲）車床部，此都有（一）小細床，凡所用七十餘種螺絲及有孔直銅皮等件用之（二）萬能大細床，凡走格長齒及定盤横直長齒等件用之（三）冲床，凡滾筒牆頭及牆板等件用之，另有（四）電力磨床備用（乙）鉗工部，此部係爲車床部製就之機件不甚凖確時，用精細之手工，使之十分凖確而設，凡字鉗以及字盤内有槽横銅皮暨各種零件屬之（丙）裝配部，此部係全部打字機造成後專爲裝配而設，按打字機一架，現有大小機件四百五十二件之多，故裝配皆係熟練工人。</p>
<p>據宋經理云，該廠每月能造華文打字機十五架，每架值銀二百四十元，目前悉心研究，務使運用更加靈速，達到每小時能打一千二百字以上，以利公牘信札合同契約等重要文件之隨時應用，一面設法减輕成本，務使各界可以普遍購用，宋君之心計，有益於文化界者，實非淺鮮也。該廠其他各項營業，如定造印刷機，儀器，火爐，案頭日曆等，限於篇幅，不及盡述，宋君歡迎各界參觀，併述於此。</p>

<p>— 胡文</p>
<p>天冷了，破棉襖還是五年前做的，風從破洞裏鑽過來，就好像是刀割着皮膚似的，可眞有些吃不消啦！自家兒是練就的厚皮，到底還可以耐耐：只是阿大，那烏孩子，怎麽那樣薄皮嫩肉的風一吹來，他就凍得曄啦嘩啦的哭啦。還有老婆的心，總是痛惜小孩子的也那麽整天整夜的嘰咕着。</p>
<p>金生可眞要氣死啦！</p>
<p>壽論如何，阿大的棉襖總該該給他做一件。自家兒的棉襖也太見不得人了，也得換一件新的。金生决定了主意，可是没有錢哪，怎麽辦？只好去和老婆商量，求她的親戚處借點錢。金生忍不住又笑啦！他把那粗黑的手拍拍荷包，裏面滿滿的睡着雪白的洋錢啦！</p>
<p>布是買來了，一塊花花緑緑的布，是給阿大做棉襖的，自家兒也買了一塊黑洋布。老婆拿着那塊花布，看了又看，便抿着嘴兒笑啦。金生也張開了大嘴，得意洋洋的說：</p>
<p>「你看哪！這些布好不好？價錢也便宜！人家說這是外國貨，誰識得啦！什麽外貨，内」</p>
<p>貨，咱壓根兒可不懂啦！咱只曉得那一件便宜就買那一件！」</p>
<p>老婆贊他買布的經騐，眞比女人還要充足，於是金生又笑啦！</p>
<p>新棉襖穿在他的身上，覺得天氣變温和了。阿大也住了哭。</p>
<p>金生每天要到山上去拾柴，枯瘦的樹枝兒，給他的新棉襖觸破啦。阿大在太陽底下和隔壁小囡玩耍，太陽并没有威力，却給阿大的花棉襖曬得褪了色啦。</p>
<p>老婆發了脾氣，就拍着桌子駡：</p>
<p>「什麽啦！我去求財神，拜菩薩借來的錢，給你買這些好外國貨呀，」</p>
<p>怎麽外國貨竟這樣的壞哪，金生可眞要氣死啦！</p>

<p>在一所最新式的立體建築物－旅舍的門前，停滿了一九三三年的新式的汽車，高高的綵牌樓，遮住了旅舍的本來面目和牠的大名，無疑的使人一望而知這是一個舉行結婚大典的禮堂；賓客川流不歇的來往着，都足以表示出這家「塲面」是很闊的。</p>
<p>結婚儀式以後，賓客們，尤其是少年們强迫新郎報告戀愛經過。新郎王君是××大學國語演說的優勝者，當然毫不羞恥的開始報告：</p>
<p>「……我倆的戀愛的經過很是簡單；至於我倆初次認識的地點，是在提倡國貨會的」</p>
<p>會議席上，第二次在中國國貨公司的櫃台上。我倆因意志相同而發生友誼，發生愛情，</p>
<p>所以簡單的說起來，我倆的介紹人便是國貨，所以我倆服用的物件衣料一律採取國貨，同時我希望諸位來賓也服用國貨……」接着便是一片掌聲。</p>

<h3 id="c295">馬戲 <a href="#c295" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e295" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">295</a></h3>
<p>— 楊餘聲</p>
<p>據說，馬戲只有外國人會議。這話，大概是有折扣的。</p>
<p>也中國，事事物物喜歡「充洋」，但做馬戲的似乎奶少。就是有，也是些「土襄土氣」的，值不得一看！</p>
<p>所謂馬戲，據確實調查」，並不盡是馬在做演戲；正如我們中國的猴戲，並非全是猴子在演戲一樣。後者雖趕不上前者的憲麗！有珍禽異獸，有凸着栗子筋的力士，有裸着雙股的女人；但叭兒狗，綿羊，是少不了的！有時還能牽出隻狗熊，這就大有馬戲的風格了！</p>
<p>馬戲和猴戲，僅就字面上講，可以斷定它們内容是不同的。不過二者似乎都少不了「人」，尤其是馬戲，「人」就物别地多·他們在戲中表演，穿插發噱，妙趣横生；這等地方，可以看出人「畜」的分别來。</p>
<p>可是看客的目光，似乎專注在「畜生」方面，祇有「畜生」奇異的表演，才值得他們稱道。」人一，要不是女的而又不裸着雙股的話，怕就没有「畜生」來得惹人注目！</p>
<p>其實，這是對的。他們看的是「馬戲」，急於要看各種不易看到的野獸，因此對於「人」的注意倒反分散了。至於說到「女人」而又涉及「雙股」的話，那是一般看客所意想不到的「外快」，落得揩油。中國人談到「揩油」似乎就會心癢的，年輕的不用說，老年人也未見得可靠」！</p>
<p>在上海，帶有「國粹色彩的猴戲没有機會看到，而海京伯馬戲國却起來取了它的位置。前」</p>
<p>者騙騙鄉下人是有餘的，後者呢，上海人就爲它大大地發過一次狂！</p>
<p>凡是看過海京伯馬戲的人，口碑怎樣，我却没有調查。但海京伯在上海時所發表的宣言，不禁使我爲中國的「國際地位」担憂！</p>
<p>據他說，要在中國搜羅一切珍禽異獸，並且還要請求中國人加入他們的馬戲團，到各國去漏一下臉。</p>
<p>這……個……我們中國有什麽「人」可以加入馬戲團呢？要是請「賣狗皮膏藥的」去充數吧，實在太不像樣。「武術團」似乎又太欠「紳士」風範，眞有材難之歎！</p>
<p>至於珍禽異獸，眞是說也慚愧，我們中國有什麽可以供獻給他呢？以前，中國倒也出產過「四不象」等等的猛獸，不過早經姜子牙在大喊「孽畜」聲中給收伏去了！此外則禽旣不珍，獸亦不奇，什麽都没有！</p>
<p>中國眞是一個「貧乏」的國家！但上次馬戲塲中的看客倒擁擠得可以！這是足以安徽海京伯的！</p>

<p>— 同初</p>
<p>對面指揮燈瞪着金魚似大眼時，這邊黄包車夫就挽留了前進的車身，汽車夫撥動停車的機鈕，「蒲蒲蒲」機器脚踏車只是在那裏發吼；一切正在這邊前進的，都站住了。大家抬了雙眼，巴望着指揮燈即刻變色，旁睨着在前驕傲似的横過的車輛。指揮燈台上的巡警呌子吹了，指揮燈的光色變了，大家急急撥動機件，比逃更機警地過去了。這時方才正可通行的路上，兩面口子，也同樣的咬住前進的車輛，他們也只得默默地恭候着。</p>
<p>繁華的街市，眞是一塊血腥的地方啊！猛虎在狂躍，豺狼在追逐。一秒又一秒，没有不籠蓋着死的恐怖。偉大光明的指揮燈，它跳在高處，猙了大眼，它的眼可怕啊！驚服了狂躍的猛虎，豺狼，在它的指揮下，偷偷地過去了。</p>
<p>我們渴望着偉大的指揮燈，跳到人們的心上；那時「猜忌」「仇視」不致發生了。我們渴望偉大的指揮燈，跳到這畸形的社會上；那時弱者們便不致被魚肉了。</p>

<p>— 清梵</p>
<p>烏金爲世間奇寳，有清一代，烏金製成用品者，共有二物：一爲太平天國翼王石達開之烏金印。石列身戎行，懸之身畔，須臾不離，愛之不啻筆二生命。後因進攻四川，爲清軍唐軍門擊敗，其印遂亦爲唐所得。及至民國，川戰屢起，唐之子孫，不能保守，被强豪所奪，降至最近，又傳落於軍人李某之手。中央曾電劉湘查詢，但尚無着落也。又一烏金製品，爲廣東何同仁藥行之搗藥杵，杵之柄用烏木製配，杵錘則爲烏金所飾，積體雖不甚大，但用以搗研堅硬性之藥材，如摧枯拉朽，極易成末。且經研之藥，亦頗奏神效，如該行最著名之烏金眼藥，用以點敷一切目疾，及外痔毒瘡等症，誠有萬試萬靈之妙。此藥創製迄今，巳歷百餘年，銷行華南海外，頗具勢力，近來上海三大公司亦有經售，極爲社會所信仰。聞該搗藥之杵，仍在該行，什襲珍藏，視同傳家之寳，非親屬子孫不得輕易一兒也。</p>

<p>第十九回　欲卽欲離同車憶往事　半哭半笑倚枕病殘秋</p>
<p>江氏立刻將頭伸進簾子來，向桂枝問道：姑娘，你這是怎麽啦？桂枝正是把眼睛半睜半閉着，猛然聽到母親呌喚，才睜開眼來看着。同時臉上是氷氷凉的，也就知道是眼淚水流在臉上，讓母親看到了。心裏這就想着，這一段心事，若是讓母親知道，那還了得？便皺着眉，微微的帶了笑容道：我渾身不得勁，心裏難受，大概是招了凉了。江氏站在坑面前，對他臉上，呆望了一陣，便道：你眞是小孩子了。招了凉，就蓋着被躺一會子罷，幹嗎還哭呢？桂枝順手掏起一隻被角來，向眼睛揉着，便道：誰哭了？我這是發燒燒出來的眼淚。江氏見他笑了，雖是有些勉强的樣子，那就竟不能算是傷心的原故，也許他眞是熬不住病，就流下淚了。這就問他道：那就好好躺着罷，要不要熬點稀飯吃呢？桂枝皺了鼎道：得啦！要是那麽着，那可就眞成了生病的樣子了。你别管我，讓我躳躺就是了。說着，一個翻身，向裏邊睡去了。江氏看那情形，倒像是病得有些不耐煩，也就不來麻煩他了。桂枝原先躺下來的時候，不過是感覺到身體疲倦，現在在坑上躺了許久，倒反是其軟如綿，身都不願意翻了。昏沉沉的，這樣躺着到了下午，身體果然也就安適着，一切苦惱都忘了。可是這是短時間的，約莫到了下午七點鐘的時候，自己已是醒了過來。（二六一）</p>
<p>小食譜</p>
<h3 id="c301">冬令補品談史藥泥　－藥補不如食補－ <a href="#c301" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e301" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">301</a></h3>
<p>— 濟宏山</p>
<p>山藥泥眞有可人的味兒，熱有熱的味道，冷有冷的味道，考究的天津和北平館子都有賣，價錢很貴，並目也未見全是純粹的山藥，往往出了很大的價錢，面却吃不到道地的東西，這裏，介紹它的做法，並且山藥是有名的滋補的東西，現在秋冬之交吃了，自然比吃補藥好得許多。先把原根山藥洗凈，放在鍋内，用水煮了一二個鐘頭後，便可酥爛，然後剥去外皮，露出完全潔好的山藥肉，放在石臼内椿爛成泥狀，使没有小塊存在爲止，在吃的時候，便放在鍋内，用少量熟猪油一起煮，待透，加入白糖使適口味，而熱透，如此，猪油也一齊被山藥吃進，那味道好極了。</p>
<p>猪油燉棗子</p>
<p>「猪油燉棗子」並不是，布爾喬亞的食品，通常大家知道，也用不到多談，方法是把好的棗子和着多量的猪油，放在燒飯的鍋子上連蒸上十多天，棗子便發胖，吸收着極多的油份，這東西人們吃了些非是增加身體内的油質，使發出更多的熱力，大胖子是該絶對忌着不吃的，否則到了明年夏天，將熟得不堪設想了。</p>
<p>核桃和白糖</p>
<p>把核桃樁碎，拌入適當的白糖，和猪油，眞會使人活血强腦，會吃酒的人用來下酒，也十分相宜，就是每天早上用開水冲一杯，吃了也很有益，不過，剥核桃的時候，要把它的内衣一起剥去，比較費事一些</p>
<p>南塘芡實</p>
<p>今年的芡實，比上往年便宜二三倍，經濟寛裕些的，很可以多吃些，代替早餐，也未始不可，今年一元便可以買二斤有餘，去年要買到二元多一斤，相去許多，也足以表示農村經濟破產己經達於極端。</p>
<p>牛奶</p>
<p>通常的牛奶，部分做ＡＢ二種，是經過工部局衛生處騐過而分做Ａ字和Ｂ字，Ａ字中的衛生物要比Ｂ字少上三倍，並且巳經經過消毒手續，卽較冷飲也不妨而Ｂ字却不行，燒Ａ字牛奶的時候，祇需略爲温暖，如果煮沸，則牛奶中的維太命也同時燒去，所以寗可出價錢較貴的Ａ字牛奶，比較妥當些。中國人自己開的牛奶棚也有好多家是Ａ字，這是值的推薦的，每月每半品脫約大洋六元或者不到些。</p>
<p>鷄蛋</p>
<p>農村中一年大量出產的鷄蛋，冬令中也要消去不少，它的功效和價錢，是用不　作者來多講，祇是對於救濟農村，也很有關係，並且有職業的人在早上吃的時候，要比别的便利許多，猶其在内地，一元可以買到五六十個很新鮮的鷄蛋，而且滋養料也足以抵過人參燕窩等等，</p>
<p>牛肉汁</p>
<p>祗要把切小的牛肉，放在專門蒸牛肉汁的鍋内，不加别的東西，用文火窩上一夜，牛肉都成了牛肉汁，鷄汗也是同樣的做法，不過内臟，頭脚都不用，餘下的肉乾，可以炙乾，做紅燒牛肉或者咖啡牛肉，祇些略爲一煮便卽酥透，可以當作一樣小菜。二角錢生牛肉，可以分二次燒，爲一人一頓的用。</p>
<p>荳奶</p>
<p>誰都知道黄荳是富有蛋白質和維太命的，因此用黄荳做成的荳奶，（俗精荳腐漿）也很受勞苦同志的歡迎，早上一大杯，費不了五個銅元，實在實惠得很，市上有專賣黄荳奶的店家，作者未曾試過，恕不介紹，自己做，自然最可靠而清潔，在預早一天，把生黄荳用水浸胖，再用石臼舂碎而加水濾之，再春再濾，約三四次，待己剩渣滓爲止，吃的時候，用火煮滾，加入白糖少許，這是最便宜，最清潔的了。</p>
<p>大衆化的冬令補品，差不多盡在於此了，其他膠滋藥，參燕銀耳，不是大家吃得起，而且也未見全合各人體質，作者也就此擱筆。</p>
<h3 id="c302">教授的秘訣 <a href="#c302" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e302" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">302</a></h3>
<p>— 鳴春</p>
<p>某教授自述其作教授之秘訣，記之以供有志於教授者。</p>
<p>一，到講堂時，要常提本人在外國讀書的經過，如「我從前在紐約的時候」。至於自己先生的名字，如什麽「約翰」「斯密士」之類，不妨多提提，能言與彼等有如何的交誼。則更好。</p>
<p>二，担任某學科時，須先搜羅關於此學科的各國參考書，每稱要略加批評！裝做讀過的樣子！最後還要聲明，就是中文參考書，還没有一本可看的。</p>
<p>三，要常常請假，免得人說資格不老，同時又可給學生們暢快暢快。</p>
<p>四，批評人家的學說，最好不要十二分的崇拜，「不過我的意見」這種話要常用的。在自己編的講義上，要多用「鄙意」字眼，以免抄襲之辦。</p>
<p>五，考試時，宜靜坐看報，間或向窗外看看亦可。</p>
<p>六，至於國事，少對學生發議論，（其實無論國難多深，我們心裏却少反響）尚未聽到帝國主義的砲聲之前，不妨倡讀書救國論，才像個學者。</p>
<p>以上諸條，係暫時保持飯碗之用，至若以教書爲階梯而想爬到官僚之路的，恕不適用。</p>

<p>— 猛克</p>
<p>一條繁華馬路的十字口，靠左手的人行道墼角處，筆挺的立着一條被雨水冲洗得變成了灰白色的電線柱。那上邊，釘着一塊紅漆洋鐵牌子，用白粉規矩地寫着好斐條馬路的名字和價目字。那洋鐵牌子下面，還成疊的貼了「白濁聖藥」一類的廣告，只是字跡早有些糢糊。電線柱的旁邊，照例是站着一羣不耐煩的人們，吵鬧着，有時欠過身去，性急地控望馬路的盡頭：臉上的神情，大抵是緊張而恨恨的。但在這兒遲緩地往來逡巡，好像永逺留戀這電線柱的，是一位弓着背，枯瘦得像猴子樣的女丐。時候雖然是深秋，她却只用一塊滿糊了污泥的麻布裹着那肉體：臉是菜色的；淋過雨，又被曬乾而成了板的黄髮，老讓它披在臂膊上。但誰一看到那面龐中心，一個還滴達着黄水的紅血洞，就要覺得少了一件東西，而且即刻想到梅毒之可怕。</p>
<p>她向人叢中慢慢移過去，那隻咖啡色的，像乾樹枒似的手爪，也從麻布底下伸出來，張開去，點頭微笑的，客客氣氣應酬着各式各樣的人們。不耐煩的人們却更加不耐煩了，太太小姐們就眉頭緊鎖，趕快察看手裏的皮包，扭轉大屁股，摇着頭逺逺避開去。她似乎很識相，並不纠纒，被她緊跟着的倒是那些斜戴「打鳥帽」，滿身汽油臭的短裝漢子。她照樣的稱呼他們做老爺，但漢子們並非因此就高興，起初也縐是摇摇腦袋，顯出爲難的神色來，只是終於不好意思，從裝着米達尺或鐵鉗的袋子裏，撈出一兩個銅板，雖然那粗糙的手伸了出去，又婉惜地收了回來的也有。</p>
<p>就在這頗爲忙碌的工作中，她生活過去了。</p>
<p>直到黄昏時候，各大商店的彩色電燈光亮起來，她才似乎察覺到自己的疲勞和飢餓，但也並没有告别這兒的意思。倚在電綫柱上面，面龐中心的紅血洞，仍然不住地滴着黄水，彷彿是在打瞌睏，又彷彿是憧憬於對面的一家酒樓上的碗筷聲，歌笑聲。</p>
<p>酒店裏的生意，一到夜就特别好，大門口，汽車包車擺成一字長蛇陣。汽車上哈哈地跳下肥頭胖腦的紳士們，後面有的還跟着一名英武的莽漢；包車却是漂亮的小姐們坐的，她們吃吃地說笑，還帶着一位老太婆，在後面一拐一拐地直跟進大門去。</p>
<p>電線柱的旁邊，依然是站着一羣不耐煩的人們，吵鬧着，一直到酒樓上没有了碗筷和歌笑的聲音。</p>

<p>二，馬的跳舞</p>
<p>只有一匹馬出塲，冷冷清清地。</p>
<p>但雖只有一匹馬，而這匹馬却很高大，毛是純黑的，馬背騎着一個全身穿白的女子，在燈光相映之下，這顏色極爲賙和。</p>
<p>看看這馬在場内慢吞吞地走，我幾乎有點不懂的樣子。</p>
<p>忽然後面擲過一句「摩登」話來，說「Ｄance」</p>
<p>幸好自己有「福氣」曾讀過幾年書，懂得這「Ｄance」的意思，仔細看這馬的脚步，和聽音樂台上的音樂，這馬也確是在「Ｄance」着。</p>
<p>心裏感到幾分興趣起來，就留意地看而且一面又想着自己從未進跳舞塲過，人的「Ｄance」雖然未曾看見，而能得看一看馬的「Ｄance」，也未嘗不是眼福這馬的「Ｄance」呢，實在也很好：音樂台上的音樂一響，牠就忸忸怩怩地跳了起來。響的聲音一慢，牠的脚步就得慢慢地：一快，牠的脚步也快；一急，則牠提起前蹄在空間左右各自踢了一下；一停，便立刻停了下來站着不動。</p>
<p>但自然，在控制着牠的，是騎在牠背上的那個女子。</p>
<p>全塲的人都拍掌。</p>
<p>我也在拍掌着。</p>
<p>没有什麽地方可以疵議的，就牠的步法配合着音樂的節奏而論：也没有什麽人不嘆服的，就牠的聰明的程度而能學得這樣的技術而論。</p>
<p>而這馬，也就因此愈跳愈加高興，終至於連尾巴也都摇擺起來，一下一下地像牠自己在打拍那樣地。</p>
<p>我感到一陣慚愧。</p>
<p>然而爲了這馬，我也替牠感到了一陣慚愧。我覺得這馬旣然這麽高大，這麽聰明，爲什麽不在戰場上或郊野裏奔馳着呢？反偏讓這樣的一個女子騎在牠的背脊上操縱，要牠這麽着就這麽着，那麽着就那麽着？</p>
<p>難道做一個女子的傀儡，反比牠獨身靠自己的力生存着還光榮些嗎？</p>
<p>我並不如此相信。</p>
<p>可是世事也眞難說，我們不必說這馬的壞話，就人類而言，也不是正有許多像這馬一樣有爲的青年，却想做一個女子的傀儡，讓她騎在自己的背脊上怎麽着嗎？只要她手裏的韁繩一動，被騎着的人是多麽快樂地跳起來啊！</p>
<p>你並不想到映入在他人的眼簾裏，這是如何的醜惡，而且彷彿以爲那騎在你背脊上的女子眞是你的主宰似的。把一切的幻想，希冀，都放進你自己的步法當中，讓嘲笑的人在你的幻覺裏在旁邊拍着掌笑着，而你自己就猶如這馬的模樣一步一步的忸忸尼尼地在跳。</p>
<p>你會相信這是你的幸福。</p>
<p>「幸福啊，幸福啊！」你在狂呌着。</p>
<p>於是，你也跳得更起勁，說不定你也擺動你的尾巴在估計你的幸福究竟有多少，就好比這馬的尾巴摇擺着在替自己打拍那麽地。</p>
<p>我知道自己過去也曾有過一次像這馬一樣地在「Ｄance」，我的臉不禁紅起來了。</p>
<p>在今天，我才看見自己過去那副醜惡的恣態。</p>
<p>我得感謝這馬。</p>

<p>朱淑貞，人第知其能詩，不知其所作文，亦婉暢之至，而書法亦不弱。有小楷書蘇若蘭織錦璇璣圖一卷，末附自己所寫的小記。此記除介紹蘇蕙歷史，解柝璇璣圖外，且多感慨語。其末節云：</p>
<p>比余備細錄解，藏之巾笥，己十一年矣。身旣於歸，俗事多累，疾首畏風，瘦腕且顫，不能自己，得非好奇之所役邪？噫！以若蘭之巧，能織於前；非予之勞，莫解於後；何世異而志同若此？則不知後之工於是圖者，復何人也？庶見者勿以婦人不事内修，而詫務文藝，烏足爲美，若是，則非憐才之士矣。請勿敢辨，冀余同心者似焉吁賣之。後記「時皇宋紹定三年四月吉幽棲居士朱氏淑貞書」十九字。觀此，可窺見淑貞生活的一斑，以及她的内心的憤慨，在封建社會中男性對女性的了解；至於文章，其餘事也。</p>
<p>七</p>
<p>「金瓶梅」一書，極得袁中郎讚賞，此事亦見「味水軒日記」：</p>
<p>十一月（萬歷四十三年）五日。沈伯逺携其伯景倩所藏「金瓶梅」小說來，大抵市譚之極穢者耳，而錄燄逺遜「水滸傳。」袁中郎極口贊之，亦好奇之過。</p>
<p>李日華與袁宏道，在思想體系上，雖屬是同道中人，在許多地方，也未能一致；觀二人對「金瓶梅」一書理解的不同，可以想見。袁有「賦君實」一詩，即贈李之作，載「狂言」一書中。</p>
<p>八</p>
<p>從幾年前的手記裏，我到了當時抄下的一首小令——「豹子令」其詞曰：</p>
<p>奇貨可居從古道，</p>
<p>從古道，俺待將版圖千里賣元朝。不學荆軻督亢虚圈套。</p>
<p>老爺啊，你却似張松親捧益州跑，貨眞需要價錢高。</p>
<p>出處當時未寫明，不知是否是「元曲選」「張松獻圖」雜劇中的話。今日重談，頗覺另有所感。像這樣的諷刺可謂高妙之至。</p>
<p>九</p>
<p>寫生活苦的詩很多，我國愛放翁的「少年逺游無百里，一飢福使走天涯」，仲刻的「排逺　年曷，支持八口難」，「畏寒偏欲衝寒來，我輩謀生不如雁。」這種詩，至少，到今日爲止，是「常新」的。</p>
<p>十</p>
<p>黄葉入詩，最饒宣象，作「談黄葉」一文以後，我又看到不少。如吳少芸的「白蓮憔悴人尋社，黄葉蕭條鵲噪村」「秋聲黄集裏，山影暮烟中」，以及「竹光如海碧雲停，逺寺鐘聲幾度聽。行盡招堤黄葉略，隔江山色到門青」）靈隱至韜光），都可以說是難得的佳句。袁中郎詩，亦時用「黄葉」但佳句不多。不過，看他的「辟將黄葉止兒啼」，可知「黄葉」尚有他用。記得明吳麟徵與其伯父生白書中有云，「又聞伯父片紙不入都門，此晚節所難當。今要津鮑厭果肉，區區黄葉，未足止兒啼，何如並省之以安清白，伯父意颧謂此邪？」其意與袁詩正同，是以「黄葉」作爲不能使人滿足的事物的隱喻。特附記。，以補前文之不足。</p>

<p>— 莫泊桑著李維克譯</p>
<p>可是不然，她欺騙了他，她騙取了他的温柔，騙取了他的誠敬，她應當毫無缺德，才對得住他，像一切母親對於她們的兒子一樣。因爲他覺得她對於他比對於他父親所犯的罪更大，於是他勃然興起的那股憤怒更差不多變成了憎恨。</p>
<p>男女之愛原是一種心願的契約，愛衰的時候，其罪止於負心罷了；可是當那女人成了母親的話，那麽因爲自然曾以一個種族交託給她，她的義務便大了。如果她這時不能堅持的話，她便是卑怯，下流，無恥。</p>
<p>「總而言之，一個人能夠薄有資產，過着安間的日子，這並不是一宗壞事。」羅蘭老爹突然這樣說，一面把兩腿伸放在桌子底下，像每晚一樣小口小口地飲着他那杯Ｃassis（黑實覆盆子所釀的酒）。我希望哲安以後會常常請我們去吃頂考究的晚餐。假使我因此有時要害起　病來，那也管不了許多了。」</p>
<p>隨後他轉身對他的女人道：</p>
<p>「你旣然吃好了飯，那麽去把那肖像尋來罷。我也很高興再看到他呢。」</p>
<p>她立起身，拿着一支蠟燭出去了。隨後，議儘其實祇有三分鐘，但在筆爾看來却像經過長久似的，羅蘭媽媽微笑着拿了那用舊式金邊鏡框　着的畫像進來了，她拈着那鏡框上的環圖尋來了，她說，「我差不多立刻就把它找到了。」</p>
<p>醫生最先伸出了手。他接過畫像，伸長手臂，隔得稍逺地審視着。隨後，他覺到他的母親在瞧着他，他便慢慢地抬起眼睛望着他的弟弟，以便兩相比較。照他那時靈的性子，他簡直要說：「嚇，這竟像哲安呢。」他雖俗没有說出這可怕的話語，但他用着這以活的面孔和畫的面孔相比的方法來表示了他的思想。</p>
<p>不錯，這兩個面孔有着一些相同的特組織；有着同一的鬍鬚，和同一的額角，可是並没有什麽地方顯明到可以使人宣佈：「噍啦，這是父親，這是兒子。」這不如說是一種家族的面貌，一種由於同一的血所煥發的形貌的相類。可是在筆爾看來，有比這兩個面孔的樣子更加確定的是：他母親立起了身，轉過背慢慢地裝做在把糖和Ｃassis收拾在一個壁櫃裏面。</p>
<p>她己懂得他知道了，或至少他在懷疑着！</p>
<p>「拿給我看看。」羅蘭說。</p>
<p>筆爾把肖像遞給他，他把蠟燭移近細看着；隨後他以一種感動的聲音低語道：</p>
<p>「可憐的孩子！我們認識他的時候正是這模樣呢。唉，時候過得多快！他那時節確是一個」</p>
<p>漂亮男子，並且他的舉動是那樣有趣，不是噣，路易兹？」</p>
<p>看見他的女人没有回答他，他便接着說道：</p>
<p>「並且又是怎樣好的性情啊！我從來没有看見他生氣過。好啦，現在完了，什麽都没有　」</p>
<p>下……祇留下遺給哲安的財產。總之，我們可以發誓這人是到死都現得是一個忠實的好朋友。甚至臨死的時候都没有忘記我們。」</p>
<p>現在輪着哲安伸出手把肖像接了過來。他把它凝視了一會兒，隨後帶着遺憾的語氣說：「我呢，我一點都不認識他。我　記得他那白髮飄蕭的像貌。」</p>
<p>於是他把畫像交還給他母親，她對那畫像投了很快的一譬，又連忙轉過眼睛來，彷彿有幾分驚懼似的；隨後却以她那自然的語聲說道：</p>

<p>— 烈火</p>
<p>站在某種立塲上說，那顯然是一幕不道德的行爲，雖然在不道德的尺度上，自古就承認並算不了犯罪；但正人君子之流，却總不免有些疾惡。在我，從當將直到現在，就這麽肯定：環境使我不得不那麽歪曲。</p>
<p>事情是在十九年，其時上海出版界，正是新興社會科學書籍介紹，編著的鼎盛時期，市面比現在景氣得多，關揭在嘗肆牌號上的，不是「大傾銷」，也不是拉拉扯扯的什麽「半價大競賣」，而是「歡迎參觀」，「新書出版」或「出版預告」，每日披露於報端的，也多是出版消息，　　爲如此，書肆的老閭都有兩三分驕傲，凸出肚腹，坐在銅欄杆的掌櫃上，大有高陞又高陞之勢，書價日比日貴起來，一本不過百多面的小册子，每在實售七八角以上：若是名著，又比較厚大些的，那就非二元以上莫想染指。再有一點，往往出版未久的書，忽要「照碼加一」起來了，總之是貴得可以。</p>
<p>這就是說是書肆老閭們的時代，他們摸着了時代輪輾下的智識階級的心，書旣出得投機合口，價目自然便於「巳高猶抬」。</p>
<p>然而侒竟有不少的窮小子，深深的感受不了這種檯舉，只能望梅止渴的發了廣告發呆。但窮小子却多數喜愛看點書，尤其在那種新興的出版空氣裏，急切的發出求智的哀嗚。　　那時我正在一爿國立學校裏厮混，學校雖是國立，圖書館裏却貧乏得十分可憐，也正因爲那時書坊裏的新書，據說多少都有幾分反動的彩色，不像三民主義規規矩矩正正經經的說理，以致圖書館主任開起書單來就不理睬這些，大批批的只顧添購古籍。自己又窮得豎不直背脊，求智慾却非常的强盛。在這種塲合之下，我曾經幾番想到「偷書」的一著。</p>
<p>然而當時的頭腦，究竟有幾分拘泥，覺得自己是堂堂乎一位大學生，「偷」這種勾當，可眞不宜於輕犯：若是失事的話，那會麽樣去臉，即不被抓入牢監，也總無法自算，所以一逕只是想，只是猶豫，不敢輕爾去嘗試。</p>
<p>有一天，受了廣告的吸引－歡迎參觀，於是我走去了所謂文化街，可眞熱閙，家家書坊裏，都是情得水洩不通，買的看的翻的，也許那裏面就有我的不少的同志，於是我在擠扎之中，嘗試了「偷」的初幕，心兒忐忑着，彷彿耳邊有嗡嗡的言響，眼前就是走油的老闆的面像在晃動。然而我終安是勝利了，就在回校的電車程中一頁一頁的翻閱起來，我笑着，竭力的把「反攻」的心理鎭壓下去。接着我更演了許多幕，許多天，於是我的床上桌上架都堆滿了平生所渴求的新書，我隨時發着微笑，我珍愛的撫摸它們，閱讀他們。原先我本是没有幾本書的，後來騶然像成了藏書的暴富，坦白的說都是偷來的。</p>
<p>不過幾年以來，又漸漸的少了下去，到現在幾乎一本也没有了，不是當面給朋友借了去就没得轉來，便是像它們自己曾逐家似的溜跑了。可是我對它己感到滿足，因爲它們己對我盡過一度貢獻，使我此到得能勉强饒饒提筆。</p>

<p>我們的芳鄰唐太太，因爲在去年死了一個心愛的掌珠，所以昨天專誠老逺的跑到江灣去，呌一個老婦關亡·據說非常靈騐，非但爹爹的姓名和職業，都回答得出，而且連自己昨天去看影戲，都會知道，你想奇乎不奇？</p>
<p>我家志弟，是前年犧牲在滬戰裏的，想他的英氣勃勃，當然魂魄也得比較病死的，要靈騐些；所以我很想去關他一關，安慰一下我的折翼之痛，可是據說這個關亡的規矩，須要差傭僕隔夜去掛號，方能從容尋覓隂魂，不致張冠李戴，這倒使我這素來没有傭僕的窮措大爲難了，但是，終究手足情深，所以在躊躇了一會之後，便决定暫時失一下教員老爺的身分，而親自去掛號了。</p>
<p>在我踏進這關亡婆的大門的時候，忽然由嵌着蠣壳的長窗裏，傳出了一種很稔熟的人聲，我駐足揣度了一會，才記起是唐家的飯司阿根。</p>
<p>「怎麽祇給我一元二角」？阿根這樣問：</p>
<p>「是的，我們照例是和走消息的四六拆的；你們太太拿出三元六角，除去六角香燭錢之外，不是分給你三四一元二角嗎？而且你來掛號的時候，報告的話，也不很詳細，少奶奶的姓名，没有說出，幾乎使我當塲弄傴；要不是三十年的老手，能夠舌頭上打滾混過去，就要壞事了」，這是一個老婦口吻的答辯：</p>
<p>我聽了他們這片段的對答，宛如兜頭一杓冷水，把我這一腔熱望，驟然降到了冷點，於是趕緊打倒車，逃出了這鬼魆之門。</p>

<p>— 惠谷</p>
<p>「機會眞難得這次又舉行高等考試了，我呢，也預備去嘗試嘗試。</p>
<p>「本來人家要去考高等考試的時候，不會向别人宣布的，因爲一旦落了選，覺得是很難以爲情，只有我不是的，我徧徧要向各位宣布，但是也要請各位原諒。一旦我落選的話，也請不要笑我。」</p>
<p>「笑話，笑話，我們會笑你？並且朱先生也寫寫意意，」同學們搶着說：含着十分客氣的意味，和巴望朱先生繼續講下去的神氣。</p>
<p>「至於我爲什麽要去考高等考試呢？則其中的原因很複雜，我曾經被馬頓的那句話說得最起勁，他說：「弱者放棄着機會，只有弱者能抓住着機會」，嘿，多麽能興奮人哪！我覺得這句話眞有價值，所以我拚命地抓住着這個機會，還有一層就是相面的人說我官運亨通，本年之内定有成效，無論如何這雖不能算是一個有意義的引力，但是他也很感動着我的，並且「做教員」名義上似乎很清高，實際上這樣教員的粉筆生涯最是不幸了，因爲這職業似乎也不過合我的個性，我爲了這點，所以想再來掉換掉換環境起見，因此去考試，…………原因多哩，恕我不多說啦！」朱先生說到這裏，驟然停止了，他笑迷迷地望着天花板，也許正在思索着什麽。</p>
<p>同學們欣然地坐着，朱先生又接着說了：</p>
<p>「我這次考試方面是考的普通行政假如考取了的話，也便有個縣長做做，句是要錄取根本就非常患難，第一場取　　　遣要考第二場，第一場考的有財政，經濟，三民主義，國文，史地，等等，第二場更其討厭了，就第一場說，我已感覺有狠多勉强，現在要考啦，便不得不臨時抱佛脚，開開夜車，唉，同你們要考的時候正如一樣」。</p>
<p>「嘘，嘘，唉，」</p>
<p>「别樣不顧，就是出席高等考試後，多少得到些人生的經騐，或許能帮助我的著作，大約下星期的課我要到南京去，所以呌馬先生暫代，」</p>
<p>「唔，朱縣長，縣長啦……同學們頑皮地笑着。</p>
<p>兩個星期巳過，高等考試也考過了，我們的國文教師－朱先生－也已回來啦！</p>
<p>「縣長，縣長來了！」同學們竊笑着，當朱先生到課堂裏來的辰光。</p>
<p>朱先生也笑迷迷地看看我們。</p>
<p>「朱先，考試的結果怎樣呢？」</p>
<p>「也不過如此，我認爲我自己也算還好吧？爲什麽呢？因爲我眼見得有許許多多的人都繳了白卷，比我不如萬倍呢－更要告訴你們，就是有些題目困難的，我把他大兜而兜圈子，寫了一大張，其實都是不關痛癢的那些話，敷衍敷衍罷了，但是或者從其間也許能得着幾分要知道這眞是一個考試的法子哩！有幾種考得還好，有幾種考得不行，大約，平均起來一個及格分數總有的咯！」朱先生很有味地背誦着。</p>
<p>「那麽一個縣長不是隱定了嗎？」老王發趣地問。</p>
<p>「不，不敢决定哩！」</p>
<p>「不要客氣」。</p>
<p>「五天後就有揭曉的，到那時我就曉得了！」朱先生這麽肯定地說。</p>
<p>「五天後朱先生一定身登及第了！一定的，一定是一個縣長」</p>
<p>「朱先生做了縣長可兇嗎？」</p>

<p>— 暉流</p>
<p>祇要是王家集的人，誰都知道王富翁的多金；同時他的田產在這地方也算最多了。全集一共四百多户，其中到有過半是以務農爲活的，所種的田總不出乎王富翁的所有。因而，他在集上到很占些勢力。他家是住在集上北梢頭的一所高可一丈的黑漆大門裏，鄰近都是一堆堆的破屋。－貧民的住所，在這許多傾圯的屋子當中，越發顯出王富翁住宅的宏敞，偉大！</p>
<p>這時，正是仲冬的天氣，因爲多時没下雨，地上積着一層很厚的沙塵，被無情的北風刮着，分外冷的覺得討厭，一到將晚的時候，風更來的大了，夜神也漸漸的吞蝕了空間的一切。從集上到北梢頭的這條路，除去一兩個行人的步，竟和呼呼的風聲外，再也聽不到其他聲息。到了夜間，九十時的辰光，連行人也都絶跡了。逺逺地傳來幾聲犬吠，隨即在距離王家兩邊百十步的一間破屋裏竄出三個黑影來，從微弱的星光裏，所以照出他倆身材的高大，似乎各個人手裏還握着一根黑越越的器械，一陣雜沓的步履，直到北首一座高大的門口停住，不必說是王富翁的住宅了。</p>
<p>這晚，王富翁剛從鄉下回來，正側着身子躺在床上抽烟消遣；並且對着他老婆興致洋洋地在身邊掏出一卷鈔票來。</p>
<p>「　　　　，你看－這簇新的鈔票，王順和他姪兒王大打家務官司，今天居然被我說得心服誠願的和解了，並且，還各人送了我二十塊錢」！王富翁很得意的把鈔票一張一張的攤着；同時又一五一十的數着對他老婆說。</p>
<p>「當然哪，没錢！誰高興替這些不相干的事。我前天不是還呌你買一付項圈的麽？你說要等到這筆錢到手就置的，我後天是要戴了出門的啦」！王富翁的老婆帶着喜恨參半的神氣渺着眼朝她丈夫發出這麽一個要求。</p>
<p>「曉得！明天就去」！王富翁莊嚴十足的答應。</p>
<p>說着，一口烟吃完，呷了一口茶，慢騰騰地從口中噴出一股烏烟來。正把第二口裝着送到嘴裏，忽然聽到一陣響，他昏瞶的腦筋裏就起了一層感覺：「這時還有人來找我說事麽？對，一定不錯」，他想到這裏就連忙喊着：「阿二，開門去」！一個十多歳的小厮應聲去了。他正要對他老婆表白自己的能幹，</p>

<p>— 張老三</p>
<p>敏姊惠鑒，晨起巳近午矣，見姊留條，知巳往學校。弟午後往徐家匯，適逢講經大會，求見舅父，冷寞不合。今遇友人，暫寓辣斐德路×百×十×號正誼社内，函直接寄此可也。</p>
<p>下面是了自己的名字。</p>
<p>小黄舉着熟藕一般手臂，在室内操行八段錦，當我醝來的時候，重慶說：</p>
<p>「小黄今天起身還没有天明呢。」</p>
<p>「他做着女人的夢啊！」我接口說。</p>
<p>小黄停止了運動，痴笑的望着我，半嚮，坐到我床邊來說：</p>
<p>「誰告訴你的？」面上的表情，最適當不過的正像銀幕上的胖子哈台</p>
<p>「重慶，笑風，慢慢的審問他罷，我的衣箱在旅館裏過了夜呢，不知也做着女人的夢没有？」</p>
<p>一陣笑聲中我坐起身來。</p>
<p>廿一不是懸愛的時候。</p>
<p>乘電梯上二樓。遇見那熟識的茶房，他告訴我；「小姐昨夜仍住在××號裏」。</p>
<p>我懷疑着命他開了房門，敏姊没有醒，桌上的烟缸中滿是烟灰，巧格力的紙包。瓜子殻，散了滿地，一本日記，倒在床邊的沙發上。我偷看了最近兩天的記載，她記着我車上的情形，記着我們在旅舍中的一夜，記着－到了學校裏，見報上她叔父登的啓事。說她挾欵潛逃，姑念先兄手足之情不予追究，從此脫離叔姪關係等語。我掏出昨夜寫的信，恨恨地撕了。敏姊爲了我趕到上海來，她叔父爲了她的出走，登報驅逐她，她的名譽爲我而犧牲，我呆呆的想出了神，隨手抽了罐中的烟，倒身在沙發上，我以爲暫將安定的生活，又宣告失敗，没有燃火的香烟在嘴角邊吸了半天，敏姊已坐在床上笑着道。</p>
<p>「想什麽遲早要發生的事」－她手指理着頭髮，小鳥一般的跳下床來。</p>
<p>「没有什麽抱歉的話」，她接着說：「你相信我爲了你在上海來嗎！我不能」</p>
<p>受他們的壓迫，他們吞没了爸爸的遺產，還欺負他遺下來的弱女，手足之情，什麽手足之情！弟弟……」她哭了，把整個的身體投到我的懷裏來嗚咽着。我也忘了自己，忘　一切，抱着她像撫愛我的弟弟哭時一樣。她忽然仰起頭來，含着眼淚狂笑「弟弟别牢記着這些小事：開始我們的新生活吧！你昨天怎樣」？說着從我懷中跳起來，脚尖在地板上旋了個身舞動着睡在的邊缘。</p>
<p>我同情她！這反抗的姑娘，卑鄙我自己的妄念，詳細地告訴她，昨天的情形，晚上寫信的事也說了，我請她原諒。</p>
<p>「慧戀着你呢」，敏姊笑着說。</p>
<p>「姐姐，我不需要戀愛，現在不是我們戀愛的時候！請你保護着你的弟弟，像我保護我的弟弟一樣」。</p>
<p>「好！寫信給你弟弟，她捧着我的臉吻了。</p>
<p>廿二四角戀愛</p>
<p>回到辣斐德路，高飛等巳均在社裏，我介紹：給社友：</p>
<p>「這位孫敏女士，是位前進的女子，恕我破了不收女社友的例。」</p>
<p>「這一次多少可以通融，」社長俏皮地回答。</p>
<p>「小黄，今後不能做亂夢了。」重慶没有說完，自己先笑了。</p>
<p>我代爲叙述了「夢」的故事，滿屋子的人全笑了起來，敏姊更無意的問了句「是這位黄先生嗎？」</p>
<p>小黄說起了老婆，寗可放棄視爲第二生命的搓麻雀；見了女人，反忸怩地說不出話來，被敏姊問着時的爲難態度，又是個滿堂彩聲。</p>
<p>這許多年青人聚合在一處，重恢復了在學校時代的生活，小黄和我，是正誼社的勞萊哈台；然而我們所抱不合作主義，你說我戀愛專家，我竭力講着女人的故事。我們好久束縛着，現在像出了樊籠的百靈一樣。今天敏姊的入社，高飛己知道我們的關係，結識，但没有知道我們今天旅館中的一幕。别的年青人，也同樣的聰明，認爲高飛允許敏姊的入社，對於我有莫大的關係，談話之間，帶着我的地方，都神秘的微笑着。敏姊却没有注意一些，她約略詢問社中的大概。</p>

<h3 id="c339">電影史上有名大失敗的事蹟（上） <a href="#c339" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e339" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">339</a></h3>
<p>— 嘉榖譯</p>
<p>普通稍爲有些電影觀察力的人，看見了一張成功的影片，總會認得出來的。但是我們看見了一張失敗的影片，亦同樣可以認得出來嗎？當然在這裏所說的，並不是指中下的出品，拙劣的製作，而是指一等大片子，由於它的失敗而影響到整個攝影塲的盛衰，大明星終身事業的成敗的。</p>
<p>一張大片子，在未公映之前，猶如賭博中的下注。注下得越大，失敗亦越厲害。但是成敗勝負之間，到底有什麽東西在冥冥中指揮着？恐怕你們常常聽見人家講一張成功片子製作的經過，從徵求本事一直到金錢的贏利。你們知道誰是勝利的健將，怎樣勝利的，如何勝利的。但是電影史上失敗的往事，並不比成功的事贵少。不過你不常聽見誰是造成那種失敗的，更聽不到那種失敗怎樣造成的，或是爲什麽。</p>
<p>一個銀幕上的大成功，附帶地就造成一個大明星，或是一個大導演，或是兩個都造成了。但是在另一方面，每一個失敗，就毁滅了一個人的聲名，打破了一個人的前途；或者，要是他的聲名是根深蒂固的，可以經得起狂風暴雨的，亦必定受一陣劇烈的打擊，經濟的損失，榮譽的降落，都在其中。</p>
<p>銀幕上失敗的事迹正和走馬燈上的人物一樣，幢幢往來，不可勝數。其成敗數目的比較，亦若有天意，大致相等。而第一次一失敗，亦即緊跟在第一次大成功之後。大導演葛當匪士（ＤＷＧriffith）製造了兩張大片子。在歷史上可以永久傳名的，是那張（ＴbeＢirthofaＮation）。但是他又拍了一張（Ｉntolerance）那第二張片子的製作，耗費了三十五萬美金，那不但在當時是一筆鉅欵，就在現在，亦就很可　了。那張片子的製作，是葛雷菲士藝術上的一個大冒險，因爲他想把世界歷史上三個不同的時代綜合起來，做成一張歷史片。因此那張片子廛，内容雖豐富，節目雖繁多，但却是吃力不討好。觀衆們不情願從巴比侖一跳跳到胡金諾時代的法蘭西，再一跳跳到現代的美國。猶之打棒球，一個球同時想擲三只角，結果是一只角都擲不到。</p>
<p>講到影界的失敗史，最令人奇怪的，就是失敗往往是不應當失敗的人所創造的。他們的知識經騐，都應當可以預先指示他們陷落之路而不使陷落。當然道高一尺，魔高一丈。必須有大才記，大經騐和大資本，纔夠造成大失敗的資格。業餘的藝術家，初出茅廬的演員們，走錯路亦不至於謬之千里也。所以大失敗之根源是什麽，可以一言而蔽之曰，個人的虚榮心，過於誇大的野心，金錢的濫用，就是造成大失敗的原素。（未完）</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3 id="c340">「古井情波」評　“ＣhrisopherＳtrong” <a href="#c340" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e340" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">340</a></h3>
<p>— 摩爾</p>
<p>當然，在社會中男女間的羅蔓斯，是最容易發生，同時是最有「戲劇性」的。所以，在電影中，男女事件佔大多數，并不是没有理由的事。「古井情波」也是一張以男女戀愛做主題材的影片。</p>
<p>社會是非常複雜和矛盾的。所以卽就男女事件一項而論，呈顯於我們面前的，也有善各式各樣的姿態。藝術家，處理一個則材，根本就是本人對於某一事件的理解和意見。所以，卽使以同一姿態的變愛故事做題材的影片，我們看到的，也是不一樣的。</p>
<p>「古井情波」中是「兩代戀愛」的故事。這裡所謂兩代戀愛，井不像「三代戀愛」一樣的顯示着幾種不同的戀愛方式。他只是說父女兩人，同樣陷入愛的阱中，不能自拔，這故事本身，我們用不到去批評。我們且看作者對於這一件故事的見解是怎樣的？</p>
<p>「芯霞亦己懷孕，深悔前愆，不欲克雷之名譽與幸福隨毁，乃毅然翔翔高空，隨機自殉矣。」</p>
<p>這是本片的收束，這也是本片作者的見解。這裏所謂芯霞，就是一個和有婦之夫的中年人戀愛的女子，但是他們秘不告人，終於在無可再隱的時候，爲了愛人的名譽而自殺了。在這背後，我們可以看到古井情波」的製作者，是認爲有婦之夫，和第三者戀愛是不名譽的。這點，他還用有少年哈里離了婚就和少女摩妮珈結婚來證實，這種包圍在傳統的觀念中的思想，本來是一批舊藝人所共有的。不過在「古井情波」中，作者是當作一個问題而公開作結論來解决了。</p>
<p>平日讀到英泊桑契柯甫的小說，總是驚訝他們觀察的深刻。他們把一件平凡的故事，用「顯微」的方式，把他介紹在讀者的面前，他們的手怯，是同於生物學家的解剖，客觀到幾乎是幾忍的地步。（自然他們也有主觀的）現在像「古井情波」製作者是應該先行觀察這故事的眞相，思索這故事的意義，然後這某一部份强調，某一部份簡略，并且更眞實的把他表現出來，而現在「古井情波」的製作者，只平庸的把故事展開，舊的内容，决定的使他没有新的形式。何况這種故事，最好就是注意心理分析，像有婦之夫開始和芯霞戀愛時的躊躇不决，以及其妻莭蘭的阻止愛女與哈里戀愛的複雜心理，這種感情和理智的衝突，實在是電影響人的最值得抓取的地方，而「古井情波」的導演，完全把他放棄了。</p>
<p>最可惜的，就是本片的女主角，本來很會做戲，但在劇情和導演的限制下。只得减削很多成積了。</p>
<h3 id="c341">評「儂本多情」ImNoAngel　-派拉蒙出品·國泰開映- <a href="#c341" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e341" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">341</a></h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>記得在今年五月二十日，在光陸看過一部「地獄之花」，梅萬縣（MaeWest）這個名字開始在我的腦海中留下深刻的印象。她那種特殊的作風，使美國片增加了形式的美麗。據美國電影雜誌的介紹，她是在葛萊泰臺寳之後最能受影迷們歡迎的人。她的賣座的數字在美國，竟在嘉寳之上，不過，如以金錢計算，却逺不如瑞典籍的嘉寳，理由是現在市塲不景氣，座價降低了的原故。</p>
<p>但是梅蕙絲爲什魔力呢？這固然是她有着演戲的天才，然而因爲她如此作風的劇藝，竟能與美國的影迷們發生强烈的感應，於此可以證明他們影迷們所需要的是些什麽。在優美的生活中，紳士們是很希望從女人身上得着妖媚的誘惑罷了。</p>
<p>的確，她是一個具有天才的演員，她有着獨到的成就。據說她的戲都是自己寫劇本，因此我們得承認她是一個優越的人才。</p>
<p>開於這一作品，我以爲導演是首先值得帮許的。最成功的那種快樂的情調，充溢着整個的畫面。自首至尾，一貫的都是明快，緊凑，在導演WerleyRuggles靈活的腕之下，没有那一小節不是教人歡喜的，譬如說法庭的塲面，一般的說很難於支配，因爲對白太多，容易使人覺着沉悶，然而在這裡，那法庭的一場，仍然是那般活潑。當然，大半的成績，應當歸功於梅蕙絲特。</p>
<p>說到這裡，又是我們必須接觸到故事的本質。這裡的女主人翁，自然是黄金國的現社會中典型的人物。她爲了盡情的享樂，不惜出賣肉體，她以整個的肉體去換取紳士們多量的金錢。有多少紳士們以最高的代價去從她身上獲得自身所缺乏而又不可缺乏的東西。當然，劇作者對於主人翁自是懷着極大的同情的。她雖然任忤的墜落，可是因着所謂眞實的愛情所感動，又於和所愛的人結合了。幸而她所愛的男人並不是窮途潦倒的詩人，所以仍然一貫的說明這種女人到底不能脫離珠光寳氣的生活。但是，我們却不能讚美這種人物吧，雖然她是社會最合理的產物。</p>
<p>同時，劇作者是假借主人翁的口吻而駡盡天下的。她笑駡紳士們，律師，甚至於尊嚴的法官，也在她的妖惑之下而向她叩首了。我以爲這樣的嬉笑謾駡，眞是淋漓痛快之至。只就這一點說，這故事己經很可取了。</p>
<p>幾個配角都很好，可是那一個加利格南脫却給人不痛快，至少他不像「鐵血鷹歌」中那般討好。</p>
<p>編者註：關於這一影片，本刋爲了「建設的批評」的實現，特請程步高，李馥，沈西苓三位，就編劇導演方面，加以詳細的研究，不日將有長文發表。即希閱者注意！</p>

<p>— 有情人</p>
<p>話說葉秋心剛搗亂了情人余光的婚禮之後，回來，獨自個兒悶在房子裏的時候，余光氣冲冲地進來，劈頭第一句就是：「你好，我的一切全給你毁了，我要你的命！」葉秋心一看來勢不對便從抽屜裏拿出一支手鎗來，對着余光說：「你能寛恕我麽？一切都是我的錯。但是，余光，你要知道我是始終的愛你的，我整個的生命，靈魂全都獻給你了！怎麽？你還恨我麽？唉，我完了…………好那我就爲你而死吧！」說着便把槍口對準自己的腦袋一紐倒卜了。這時的余光，就是後悔也來不及了。他忙走上前去，把葉秋心抱起來，眼見得葉秋心在喘息中，從貼胸的襯衫裏，取出一頂壓髮的絲帽來，對着余光說道：「這是你、</p>
<p>的帽子，我不知吻遇幾千萬遍，現在還給你罷！」余光愕然。「上面有我的血，爲愛而流的血！」余光爲之感動而流淚了。余光！你不要難過，你听眼淚告訴我，你已經饒恕了我，同情了我，我很夠滿足了……余光：你别流淚，這是我一生中最甜美的時候，我很快樂！」葉秋心斷續地說了，這些，那無力的眼睛注視着余光在淌眼淚的臉部，「你……你在我呼吸没有停止以前，請你給我一吻。這是我最後的要求……」這樣的在余光的懷抱裏，在余光的最後的一吻中，慢慢地葉秋心死了！</p>
<p>這是，裘芑香導演的「青春之火」的最後一個場面。眞是熱烈，而又緊張啊！其實，這全都是那「青春之火」在作祟呢！（却酬）</p>

<p>— 素因</p>
<p>他們母女五人，每人手裡托了一個盒子，從馬區的房子裏魚貫而去。對面的房子裡，有一個孩子從窗户裡向外張着。奇奥說這：「我看勞倫斯家裡那個孩子，怪可憐的。老逺的從歐洲回到家來，無那個做他祖父的老怪物關在一所空房子裡。　她說着，情不自禁的向他擺着手。美格禁止她道：「不要這樣。人家要當你是擺手招呼他的。」奇奥很倔强的，擺手擺得越厲害了，她以爲那個孩子不見到看得見的。但是她偶然一回頭，看見他亦擺手哩。她臉紅了，趕緊和亞梅搶着走到前頭去了。她心中自己忖度着：（那孩子怪可愛的。我想和他認識認識。但是美格的神氣，是一本正經的。我總要想一個方法……」她心中己經打定了主意。</p>
<p>那勞倫斯家的孩子，在自己家裡樓上窗户口看着那個聖誕游行隊走了過去。他是常常從窗户口偷他們的。他們的名字，他亦都知道了，因爲他們互相稱呼的時候，被他聽見了。他猜想著美格最大，　大概比他自己大過一兩歳。她是很甜蜜，和善，安嫻的一位姑娘，他並且知道他每天要走過那小山，在那所大房子裏教那金家的幾個孩子。他心裡希望金家的孩子，不要像他自己那樣頑皮，使美格太難受了，因爲他自己的教師，約翰勃羅克，是常常受他的欺侮的。勃羅克的年紀，亦不比美格大到那裏去。他亦不是不喜歡勃羅克，但是不知道怎樣的，他總喜歡拿他尋開心。他想奇奥年紀和他差不多。她像一個男孩子似的，恐怕在姊妹之中，她最淘氣了。她要每天到她姑母家，做那老悖姑母的伴侣。那當然不是好差使，所以她一回到自己家裡，就跳蕩自由得像没有籠頭的馬了。但有時候，她亦在樓上小屋子裏寫東西，眉頭縐着，若有深思似的，可不知這她寫些什麽。蓓絲是最靦覥了，勞倫斯家的孩子想，但她却是最甜蜜不過的。一家的人，大家最看得起她。有的時候，奇奥和亞梅爭論起來，蓓絲總是在中間作調解人的。亞梅呢，還是一個小妹妹哩。她有金黄色最長的鬈髮，眞像一個故事裡的公主。她最喜歡做作，喜歡文雅，喜歡用很長的字眼，他想到這裏微笑着。</p>
<p>他還是在張望着，近不知他們在吃早餐的時候，每人拿了東西，上什麽地方去了。他從窗口張望着，看見他們桌子上的東西都没有了，又看見他們的傭婦漢娜好像在擦眼淚似的，把一盆子的麵包和一罐頭的牛奶放在臺上了。呀！他們不要是拿聖誕早餐去賙濟窮人了吧！他們這種人是喜歡作那種好事的！……馬區家是很窮的，但是他們還可以給些那比他們還要不奉的人。他濚濚地想着，想亦要帮帮他們的忙。於是他偷偷兒到他祖父的書房裡去了。（未完）</p>

<p>(Nanjing) According to a certain agency, members of the Central Executive Committee Zhang Ji, Liang Hancao, and others are going south to discuss state affairs with members of the Southwest Committee. Zhang does not decline the mission to go south, but his delay is because going south will be futile. Zhang must wait for the central government to find possible people to accompany him south. Important people have been meeting for days and telegraphed Chiang in Jiangxi for his opinion. After a proper resolution is obtained regarding the proposal for mediation in the Southwest, it will be handed over to Zhang to take south, and it is planned to send President of the Judicial Yuan Ju Zheng with Zhang to the south to meet with the various committees to discuss matters. Currently, Ma Chaojun is unable to leave Beijing due to business and is seeking Ju Zheng's consent. It is said that Ju Zheng is willing to wait until the central government has given him a concrete and proper solution to the current situation before he is willing to go. Therefore, the focus of this issue is how the central government decides on a proposal for mediation in the Southwest. If a solution can be obtained early, Zhang and Ju can make the trip; otherwise, it will have to wait. However, in principle, the central government has increasingly focused on a political solution to the current situation and will not allow any war to break out before it is decided whether or not to go south. Chairman Chiang telegraphed Beijing, hoping that President Wang would take a trip to Jiangxi to discuss replying to the Southwest, and ordered Ford aircraft to be available in Beijing.

<p>(Nanjing) British Ambassador Lampson, accompanied by Secretary Scott and Counselor Teichman, went to the National Government at 10:00 AM on the 6th to bid farewell to Chairman Lin and to submit his letter of recall. He was greeted by Vice Minister Xu Mo, and Lin received him in the Second Conference Hall. Zhang Pingzhong and Qu Chang were assigned by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to translate. After exchanging pleasantries, Lampson presented his letter of recall and had tea before departing. At 1:00 PM, the Returned Students Association and the Sino-British Cultural Association hosted a banquet for Lampson at the Lizi Society, with Wang Shijie delivering a farewell speech on behalf of the association. He said that Ambassador Lampson had been in China for seven years and had received praise from people in China, Britain, and other countries. His outstanding achievements were not due to his skillful diplomatic tactics, but to his broad vision and sincere treatment of others. It is hoped that Ambassador Lampson will continue his past spirit to promote goodwill between China and Britain after leaving China. Lampson replied that he came to China when China was turning to internal unity and when his country's diplomatic policy was determined. Therefore, he only slightly fulfilled the work of promotion and achieved the most intimate results in Sino-British friendship today, which is very gratifying. However, he should thank you and the people of your country, because the goodwill is mutual, not one-sided. The current goodwill between China and Britain is purely due to the friendly spirit shown by the people of your country, which has contributed to his departure from China, but he is extremely concerned about the Sino-British Cultural Association and will do his best to promote it to the greatest success and hope that you will continue your efforts. At 4:00 PM, the British Consulate opened a farewell party, and Lampson and his entourage attended. Government officials Zhu Jiahua, Chu Minyi, Chen Gongbo, etc. also attended until 6:30 PM. At 8:00 PM, Wang hosted a farewell banquet for Lampson at the Iron Department's No. 1 official residence.

Someone presented a card to visit Lampson and asked what his thoughts were on China before leaving China. Lampson, busy with official business, sent his secretary, Scott, to meet him. It was said that Ambassador Lampson expressed that he was very reluctant to leave China because he had served in China for seven years and had a very good understanding of the Chinese people's character, and they are the most peace-loving people in the world, but he had to leave China because he was ordered to be transferred to Egypt. (Sixth Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) British Ambassador Lampson went to the National Government to meet Chairman Lin on the morning of the 6th to present his letter of recall.

He will stay in Egypt for about a few weeks and then return to England to consult with the British government. According to Ambassador Lampson, the new British Ambassador to China, Knatchbull-Hugessen, will arrive around January next year, take a liner east from England, and arrive in February, but the exact date is still unknown. He very much hopes to meet the Ambassador on the way so that he can talk. When the reporter visited Ambassador Lampson today, Ambassador Lampson was out visiting guests and had not returned. The staff of the embassy greeted the guests and introduced Mrs. Lampson and Miss Lampson to meet. Miss Lampson said that Mrs. Chiang had given her a vase, which was very precious, and praised the excellent climate of Beiping, saying that it was still like summer when she left Beiping on the 4th. Ambassador Lampson returned and said that he had been in China for many years and had a very good feeling for our country and could not bear to leave. He also hoped to revisit China. Ambassador Lampson also had a written statement in English expressing his feelings about leaving China. Ambassador Lampson is now 52 years old and entered the diplomatic world at the age of 23. In 1916, he served as the First Secretary of the British Embassy in China. In 1926, he was appointed as the British Minister to China for seven years. He has a very cordial relationship with all levels of Chinese society and has made contributions to strengthening Sino-British relations. He has now been ordered by his government to be promoted to Minister to Egypt. (Sixth Day Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) British Ambassador Lampson took the night train to Shanghai on the 6th to wait for a liner to return to his country. Before leaving, he issued a farewell letter to the people of our country. The translation is as follows: I have served as the British Minister to China for seven years, and I feel deeply sad to be separated from China and my Chinese and foreign friends in China. I will always pay attention to the future of the Chinese people with a very friendly perspective. I arrived in China on November 30, 1926, to take up the post of British Minister to China. Many events have occurred during these years, and we can be deeply gratified that because of the friendship, sincerity, and understanding of both parties, Sino-British relations have achieved such a satisfactory position. The Chinese people have experienced many difficulties in the past 20 years, and they have been able to overcome them safely, which shows the greatness of the Chinese people's strength. Although the recent future is uncertain or difficult to predict, I firmly believe that the Chinese people will eventually complete their work and build a new country. The slogans and goals of China today should pay attention to the three things of unity, security, and construction. True unity can be achieved as soon as possible, security can be achieved as soon as possible, and construction can be completed as soon as possible, so that China can become a strong and powerful country with developed businesses, occupying its rightful place among the world's strong countries. The above is not only the hope of our people (referring to the British) and myself, but also the basic principle of British Far East policy. (Sixth Day Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) After the Fisheries Administration was abolished, the Shengshan fishing ground and the escort ship returned to Shanghai for reorganization. Now it is the fishing season, and fishermen gather, while the local bandits in Wenzhou and Taizhou take advantage of the absence of the escort ship to carry out robberies. 20 large fishing boats were robbed, each worth more than 10,000 yuan, totaling more than 200,000 yuan. Fishermen and merchants sent two representatives, Xu Yifei and others, to Beijing to petition the Ministry of Industry, requesting that an escort ship be sent to protect fishing as usual.

<h3 id="e38">Welcome Marconi to China <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>Marconi, the father of radio invention, is coming to China for a visit and will arrive in Shanghai from Nanjing today. We extend our sincere welcome to this scientist who has made great contributions to human culture. We now present.</p>
<p>His honorable life and his success as follows.</p>
<p>Marconi is Italian. He was born on April 25, 1874, in Bologna, Italy. He is sixty years old this year. He studied at Leghorn in his youth and was a prominent student of Professor Rosa. Later, he entered the University of Bologna. From that time on, he devoted himself to the study of radio.</p>
<p>Marconi's initial success can be considered the short-distance experiments in England in 1897. After that, some of his most honorable and memorable periods were in 1899. Wireless communication began between England and France. In 1901. The first communication across the Atlantic. In 1902. Direct communication between England and the United States and Canada. In 1904. The establishment of shipboard daily newspapers, allowing passengers at sea to receive mainland news daily. In 1910. Communication between Ireland and Argentina (5,600 miles). In 1930. Direct wireless telephone communication with Australia from the "Electra" ship in the port of Genoa, Italy, and the use of radio waves to light the electric lights in the electrical exhibition in Sydney, Australia. His most proud invention in his life was the vacuum tube. From this powerful tool, he gained infinite mysteries. He often felt that his current laboratory was not enough. He hopes to expand from this earth to the entire universe. To be used as a test to communicate with other planets.</p>
<p>Today, our country's scientific knowledge is truly too backward. The talent that our country needs most now is scientists. However, the future of science is limitless. The opportunities waiting for our young scientists to work hard are even greater than the opportunities for Marconi to work hard. As long as our young scientists continue to experiment diligently. Marconi has a famous saying. "I would like to tell you all that if you can do one thing wholeheartedly, you will definitely succeed." I hope that the young people of our country can keep this in mind.</p>
<p>A scientist's efforts in an invention must indeed rely on the great achievements left to him by his predecessors. However, modern great inventors also need a generation of young people to inherit his great success. And go a step further. To open up a new world for human culture. Today we welcome Marconi. I hope that our young scientists. Can inherit his great achievements with the spirit of Marconi's invention of radio. To benefit mankind.</p>
<p>Science has no nationality. The contribution of scientists. It is all over humanity. So today we welcome Marconi. It is more enthusiastic than any foreign guests. We wish Marconi's career longevity.</p>

<p>(Paris) This morning, Foreign Minister Pang Gu met with Henderson, Chairman of the Disarmament Conference. Mr. Henderson has recently observed the work of the Armaments Inspection and Military Quota Committees in Geneva for several days. This morning, he specially reported to Pang Gu on the results obtained by the various committees and discussed how to incorporate these results into a future general disarmament convention. In the afternoon, Pang Gu also met with Henderson, Chairman of the Disarmament Conference, and the meeting lasted from 5 pm to 6 pm, after which a communiqué was issued, stating that Pang Gu and Henderson had a long meeting, during which they discussed issues related to the Disarmament Conference and currently under discussion by all parties. Both of them believed that the work completed by the various working groups in Geneva was very beneficial. The Presidium of the Disarmament Conference believed that the issue of guaranteeing the implementation of the future disarmament convention was very important and had not been discussed by the Disarmament Conference, and specially entrusted Henderson to prepare a report on this matter. Mr. Henderson specifically sought France's opinion on this point, and Pang Gu told him everything he knew. The two then discussed the issue of continued talks between governments. (5th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Paris) Henderson, Chairman of the Disarmament Conference, discussed with French Foreign Minister Pang Gu today for a long time on diplomatic negotiations with Germany. It is heard that the two agreed that this secret negotiation can only be based on the declaration made by British Foreign Minister Simon in Geneva on October 14. At that time, Simon represented the major powers in declaring his firm opposition to Germany's immediate rearmament. (6th National Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Berlin) The British Ambassador to Germany, Sir Phipps, met with German Chancellor Hitler today to discuss disarmament issues, lasting for an hour. Hitler reiterated his eagerness to immediately reach an understanding with France. At the same time, the British Ambassador stated that the British government was very willing for France and Germany to reach a compromise on disarmament and other issues. It is heard that the German government is now waiting for the new French government to express its views on the results of the talks between the French Ambassador and Hitler. (5th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Paris) Some quarters said that France's views on disarmament had changed. Since Pang Gu's meeting with Henderson today, it has proved that this news is not accurate. The French proposal has not changed the work of the Disarmament Conference at all. Pang Gu made this clear to the press tonight. Pang Gu said, "The disarmament work will continue, but it cannot go beyond the scope clearly pointed out in my recent speech in the House of Representatives." It can be seen that the saying of changing intentions is completely unfounded. (5th Havas Dispatch)</p>

<p>Rome The Italian Pan-System Party Congress met last night, chaired by Prime Minister Mussolini. A communiqué was issued after the meeting, stating that the Pan-System Party Congress began its work in the twelfth year of the Pan-System Revolution. The Prime Minister took the opportunity to announce the Pan-System Revolutionary guidelines, which apply not only to Italy but also to the whole world. The Congress decided that Italy would remain a member of the League of Nations, but only on the condition that the League of Nations be fundamentally transformed in the shortest possible time. The so-called transformation refers to the organization, operation, and goals of the League of Nations. The Congress is scheduled to meet again tomorrow night. (6th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>Rome Today, the Fascist Congress decided that unless the League of Nations is immediately and thoroughly reorganized, Italy will follow in the footsteps of Japan and Germany and withdraw from the League of Nations. This resolution has been approved by Prime Minister Mussolini and other cabinet members. Mr. Mussolini also attended the meeting as a party member. It is heard that Italy will soon put forward specific proposals for reorganizing the League of Nations. (5th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<p>Rome The meeting of the Fascist Party Congress ended this morning. The Italian Prime Minister and all cabinet members attended. The meeting demanded a major revision of the League of Nations Covenant. Italy's continued membership in the League of Nations will be conditional on the purpose and status of the League of Nations being revised in the near future. Italy advocates that the League of Nations should be reformed in three ways: (1) The voting rights of small countries should be limited in matters that are only partially related to small countries; (2) The procedures of the League of Nations meetings should be simplified. Italy believes that endless discussions and the endless emergence of committees only prevent the meetings from progressing; (3) The League of Nations should not uphold the Treaty of Versailles and other similar treaties. Italy has struggled for this move, because the League of Nations has become an instrument for defending the interests of the victorious countries under British control, dividing European countries into propertied and property-less factions, so the League of Nations can only become a universal organization after a major reform. (6th National Dispatch)</p>
<p>Rome Last night, the Pan-System Party Congress decided that Italy would remain a member of the League of Nations, but only on the condition that the League of Nations be fundamentally transformed in the shortest possible time. This resolution was issued late at night, and political and diplomatic circles only learned of it this morning, and did not think it was very different. Regarding the substance of the reorganization of the League of Nations, Italy's claims can be briefly described as follows: Italy has always criticized the League of Nations for being too broad in scope, so it has always advocated the establishment of a system of grading countries, arguing that some major countries should occupy special positions. In addition, Italy does not want to exclude the United States and Russia and advocates seeking two ways to make it easier for the United States and Russia to accept and join the reorganized League of Nations. Italy also wants the League of Nations to have a spirit of substantial cooperation. As for the obligations of member states to the League of Nations, there should be greater freedom, so that the League of Nations does not become a judging authority, but only an advisory authority.

<p>Rome Today, it was learned from reliable sources that Italy will invite the great powers to study the plan to reorganize the League of Nations. The main purpose of the reorganization is to strengthen the power of the League of Nations so that it becomes a truly effective institution and eliminates today's pathological state. As for the reorganization plan, it will be made into a complete plan by the General Assembly of the Fascist Party and then submitted to the League of Nations. No specific methods have been planned yet. It is heard that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini firmly believes that the soundest basis for reorganizing the League of Nations is to conclude a seven-power treaty that can control world politics.

<p>Rome Unofficial quarters predict that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini will soon make suggestions regarding the reorganization of the League of Nations. The Italian Prime Minister obviously wants to bring all the important countries that are not currently members, such as Japan, Germany, the United States, and Russia, into the League of Nations. He wants to greatly reduce the rights of small countries, because when Geneva previously discussed the Manchurian incident, small countries that had little to do with this dispute spoke a lot and occupied a very advantageous position, which Italy did not agree with. The Italian Prime Minister wants to amend Articles 10 and 19 of the League of Nations Covenant. As for expansion, the Italian Prime Minister wants to see economic expansion, including the international distribution of raw materials, because the sanction debate method contained in Article 16 can be considered immature. The above views only represent the general attitude of the Italian people. (6th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Geneva) The resolution of the Fascist General Assembly was expected long ago. Some quarters believe that the General Assembly's approval of Italy's withdrawal from the League of Nations is to give Italian Prime Minister Mussolini an instrument to reorganize the League of Nations according to Italy's views. Many people sympathize with Italy's determination to revise the League of Nations Covenant, because fifteen years of experience have shown the effectiveness of the League of Nations and its weaknesses that should be improved. However, Italy's proposal to organize a supreme administrative council is not supported by people. (6th Reuters News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) After Japan officially withdrew from the League of Nations on March 27 of this year, it had originally established the general principle of completely severing relations, but later, because Dr. Tanakadate, a member of the League of Nations Cultural Committee, resigned, the League of Nations requested that a successor be sent.

Mr. Litvinov first stated that the purpose of this official visit was neither to change the existing diplomatic relations between Italy and Russia nor to seek new cooperation methods or compromises that are harmful to other countries. Mr. Litvinov said that fortunately, Italy and Russia have not only had no conflicts in the past ten years, but have never even had disagreements. Mr. Litvinov continued, "However, in addition to the interests directly related to Italy and Russia, there are still many international issues that we cannot ignore. These issues are increasing day by day and disputes are becoming more and more serious." The purpose of Mr. Litvinov's visit was to personally contact Italian Prime Minister Mussolini on these issues so as to study the attitudes that the two governments should take towards these issues. After exchanging views, it was proved that the policies of the two countries have many similarities. Mr. Litvinov also said that the Soviet Russian government always seeks ways to maintain peace when observing international issues. All plans that can guarantee peace can be approved or participated in by the Soviet Russian government. "Therefore, all those who love peace should not have doubts about the Soviet Russian diplomatic actions and the exchanges of its diplomatic representatives." Soviet Russia has recently conducted various diplomatic talks, on the one hand seeking to consolidate the relations between Soviet Russia, France, the United States, and Italy, and on the other hand maintaining general peace. Mr. Litvinov's visit to Rome this time is a scene of this kind of talk.</p>

<p>(London) According to the remarks made by Dominion Secretary Thomas in the House of Commons this afternoon, the British government does not wish to send an ultimatum to the Irish Free State, so the door to a satisfactory resolution remains open. Today, the Members' seats and the public gallery were both packed. Free State High Commissioner Dulanty and South African High Commissioner Walter were also present. Thomas today explained the British government's reasons for not responding to the Irish Free State's request for its attitude should South Africa declare a republic. He first read a letter from Irish Executive Council President de Valera, stating that Thomas's remarks in the House of Commons on November 14, asking the House to pay attention to the three bills proposed by the Free State Parliament, were in conflict with the Anglo-Irish Treaty. He also expressed the British government's hope that the Free State would remain a part of the British Empire and willingly accept its responsibilities and enjoy its privileges. De Valera then refuted this, stating that the Irish people had never wished to be a part of the British Empire and that their union with Britain and the British Empire had never been voluntary. They had always wished to maintain their right to be an independent nation. Their submission to British rule in any form was due to oppression by superior power and was not their wish. The Anglo-Irish Treaty of 1921 did not fundamentally change Ireland's attitude, and the Irish people did not regard it as a final solution to Anglo-Irish relations or recognize that it gave Britain the right to interfere in the constitutional development of Ireland. The Free State government inferred from Thomas's remarks on November 14 that the British government now also knew the harm of forced union and would not regard Ireland's decision to secede from the British Empire as a reason for war or other acts of aggression. This attitude of the British government should be formed in a direct communication.</p>
<p>Thomas's reply stated that the British government could not accept the description of the relationship between the two countries in the letter. He then stated his views on the 1921 Treaty as stated in his public letter of April 1932, as follows:</p>
<p>"The British government's establishment of the 1921 Treaty was with a simple desire, which was to end the long-standing animosity between the two countries from then on. The British government is confident that this resolution has created a peace and satisfaction that no other method could achieve. Furthermore, the Free State has thus been able to participate in the significant constitutional developments of the past few years, especially the status of the Dominions and Britain as members of the British Empire under the Crown, which is a practical provision and is recognized by the world. This is also a direct result of the 1921 settlement."</p>
<p>Thomas's reply also pointed out that the 1921 Treaty was formally recognized by the elected representatives of the Irish people, and subsequent Free State general elections added to this recognition. During the period from 1921 to 1932, there was much development in friendship and cooperation between the two countries. He continued that the British government could not accept the assumption that permanent friendship could not be established based on the current relationship, so it did not see any reason to answer questions based on this assumption. The British government did not believe that the Free State government was trying to renounce its treaty obligations in the manner indicated in the letter. Therefore, the British government did not wish to explain its intended attitude in what it considered to be purely hypothetical circumstances. Under this treaty, the Free State already enjoyed the freedom to interact on an equal footing with other members of the British Empire. The British government felt that this interaction was ironclad proof of Ireland's free development of its own future within the British Empire. The natural union between Britain and Ireland was necessary for their complete prosperity. The British government had always sincerely wished to manage affairs with the Free State in a friendly and cooperative manner as a member of the British Empire. Opposition leader Lansbury asked whether other members of the British Empire could be consulted. Thomas replied that the dispute arose because the Free State denied its Anglo-Irish treaty obligations, so this was a matter between Britain and Ireland. He did not wish to involve other Dominions. The British government's intention was not to close the door to an honorable resolution. If other Dominions were consulted, then other Dominions would be affected. He hoped that this situation would not occur. If it did, he would inform the House in detail. However, he wished speakers not to make remarks that would only make the situation more serious. Before Thomas read the letters, a Member of Parliament asked whether it would be possible to make the people of the Free State living in Britain and the Free State aware of the disadvantages in their status and entry into Britain after the Free State declared a republic. Thomas replied that he did not feel that it was necessary to take this step yet. He hoped that this situation would never materialize. The privileges enjoyed by the people of the British Empire in Britain were different from those of foreigners. This was well known. (5th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e61">German Government Issues Declaration on the Jewish Question: Jewish Influence in Germany Is Enormous; Dealing With It Is Related to Survival <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>(Berlin) German Interior Minister Frick today issued an important declaration on the question of dealing with Jews, stating that the National Socialist Party's laws on racial issues are based on the principle of preserving racial purity. This is of the utmost importance to the future survival of the German nation. The same principle has also been put into practice in other countries, especially in Asian countries. However, in Germany, the foreign people who occupy the greatest power are the Jews. Although the number of Jews in Germany is only 1.5% of the total population, since the last ten years or so, especially since 1918, they have been successively moving into Germany from Eastern Europe. They have come to wield enormous power in the German economic, financial, cultural, and political spheres, far exceeding their numbers. For example, in Prussia alone, of the total of 11,814 lawyers, Jews account for 3,515, which is 29.8% of the total. Furthermore, as for public registrars, Jewish people account for 1,945 of the 6,226, which is 31.2%. If we consider the position of Jewish people in German universities, the composition is even more astonishing. Approximately 30% of ordinary professors are Jewish. In the medical departments of the Universities of Breslau and Berlin, Jewish professors occupy 45% of the total. This excessive expansion of foreign people has become an urgent issue for the survival of the German nation. Therefore, Germany's racial laws are based only on the principle of self-preservation and do not involve racial hatred. Today, the German government's goal is to preserve the traditional German concepts of the German state, and can thus protect racial purity. But this does not mean that the German government has the right to judge foreign nationalities. The German government is well aware that many of the foreign people in Germany represent ancient and highly civilized peoples. Therefore, the German government and people do not dare to despise the inherent value and contributions of other nationalities. At present, foreign people residing in Germany can still live and work in peace, and German schools continue to accept the children of foreign people. Given the importance of the German nation's self-preservation, other countries also have this kind of assertion. Therefore, when Germany receives requests from various countries and regions to deal with racial issues, marriage issues, etc. as soon as possible, the German government is greatly surprised. If other countries arbitrarily spread rumors about Germany's national legal system, then apart from being based on false and incomplete hearsay, it is a malicious slander against Germany.

<p>New Delhi Japanese private representatives, including Bing Shang and Ono, believing that the Indian-Japanese trade conference has no hope of success, withdrew from the meeting today and will return home within the week. According to sources close to the Indian representatives, the Indian side's firm attitude is due to: (1) India wants to revise existing trade treaties with other countries, so it wants to obtain the most favorable terms possible in the Indian-Japanese conference so that it can serve as a basis for future conferences with other countries. (2) Japanese textile manufacturers and cotton merchants are unwilling to make any concessions, which has created a bad impression on the Indian people, so they are also unwilling to compromise. (3) The British House of Commons is taking a hostile attitude towards Japan in industry and commerce. (6th National Telegraph)</p>

<p>(Moscow) Eastern Siberia is rich in resources. The Angara and Yenisei Rivers have a power generation potential of 185 million kilowatts, and there are large deposits of minerals such as tungsten, gold, other precious metals, tin, lead, copper, iron, and coal reserves of approximately 28.5 billion tons. The huge plan to develop this region (the so-called Angara-Yenisei Great Plan) was drawn up by some of the Soviet Union's most famous scientists. Its implementation period will be from ten to fifteen years. According to this plan, seventeen hydroelectric power stations will be built on the Yenisei and Angara Rivers, with a total power generation capacity of 73 million kilowatts. Various factories will be built around these power stations, such as factories for manufacturing artificial rubber, artificial dyes, and various mining factories. The area is also rich in wood, so paper and pulp mills and other textile industrial enterprises will be set up. In 1934, woodworking factories, paper mills, and wood manufacturing plants will be built first. If eastern Siberia is fully developed, it will be able to supply 50% to 55% of the Soviet Union's national demand for ferrous alloys and electric steel, as well as 50% of lead. At the same time, the plan also stipulates that at the beginning of the third five-year plan, the electrification of the Great Siberian Railway from Moscow to the Pacific will be completed using the electricity from the region.

<p>(Washington) The American experiment with Prohibition officially ended at 6:55 p.m. today, with the U.S. President issuing a proclamation repealing the Eighteenth Amendment to the Constitution, which stipulated Prohibition. At the same time, he also announced the immediate abolition of several additional special taxes levied in the recovery plan for gasoline, capital, and bonuses. This special tax can generate 225,000,000 yuan annually. Now that it has been compensated by the liquor tax, it is abolished immediately to relieve the people's hardships. When announcing the end of Prohibition, the U.S. President also asked the people of the country to exercise self-restraint and not to indulge in drinking, to purchase alcohol from licensed taverns, to help the government eliminate smugglers, and to increase tax revenue. He also asked the states not to restore the old taverns. As Prohibition was lifted, the Alcohol Import Commission immediately announced that the first allocation of import quotas for liquor from various countries had been drafted and licenses could be obtained and imports transported immediately. The quotas set were not announced. The International Reform Alliance, which has always been the strongest advocate of Prohibition, is still making a last-ditch effort to recognize that the ratification of the Twenty-First Amendment to the Constitution by the National Conventions of States did not comply with constitutional procedures. It appealed to the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia to prevent the Undersecretary of State from formally announcing the end of Prohibition, but it was rejected today by Judge Ray. Officials estimate that the American brewing industry is now selling 60 million yuan in stocks to expand its business. (5th National Telegraph)</p>

<h3 id="e119">Negotiations Still Pending for the Takeover of Yuguan: Japanese Still Occupying Dongluocheng Inside the Pass; Iwai Arrives in Beiping to Negotiate with Huang and He; No Intention of Withdrawal from Pseudo-Army in Malanyu <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>Beiping Correspondence: Regarding the issue of taking over the passes along the Great Wall, although the Japanese have declared they will return them, they are still creating many obstacles. For example, regarding the takeover of Shanhaiguan, the Japanese had previously agreed that the North China military and political authorities would send Tao Shangming and Zhu Shiqin, accompanied by a military attaché from the Japanese embassy, to Yuguan to negotiate the takeover procedures. After Tao and others arrived in Yuguan, they consulted with Endo, the staff officer of the 14th Mixed Brigade of the Japanese Army, and Iwai, the newly appointed head of the Yuguan Special Affairs Agency, on all matters. Unexpectedly, the Japanese then proposed to build barracks and open markets in Dongluocheng (inside the Great Wall), a place four or five li outside the east gate of Yuguan County, moving all the pseudo-organizations and pseudo-police inside Yuguan City to that location. At the time, Tao and others believed that Dongluocheng was inside the Great Wall and close to Yuguan City, which was not in line with the principle of taking over the passes, and feared that the close proximity would easily lead to disputes. This was outside the scope of their mission and authority, and they could not make a decision. Subsequently, they telegraphed the authorities for instructions, and it was also deemed a major issue, and it was advocated that it be discussed at length and temporarily shelved, resulting in the Yuguan meeting ending without result.</p>
<p>After the Yuguan meeting, Tao and others went to various counties in eastern Luan to inspect, while the Japanese, without waiting for our consent, immediately started construction in Dongluocheng. In recent days, a portion of the project has been completed. The Japanese also sent Iwai, the head of their Yuguan Special Affairs Agency, to Beiping for negotiations. Yesterday, Iwai arrived in Beiping with Tao Shangming, and in the afternoon, guided by Tao, paid respects to Huang Fu and He Yingqin to make diplomatic greetings. Then, they had a lengthy discussion on the issue of taking over Yuguan. According to Iwai's statement to our side, the Japanese use of Dongluocheng is temporary, for the convenience of relocating the garrison and various agencies of the puppet state. Currently, the barracks and agency buildings are under construction, and will be completed in two weeks, at which time the Japanese army will relocate and the various agencies of the puppet state will also move, and the takeover of Yuguan can be realized simultaneously. However, it is heard that the Japanese army's construction there is intended for long-term occupation, which our side will find difficult to recognize. Therefore, the negotiations in Beiping have not yet yielded satisfactory results. It has been decided that Iwai will return to Yuguan tonight (the 3rd) at 8:00 PM. The counties in eastern Luan, Yuguan, and various passes have not been taken over and are also being ravaged by bandits. For example, the area around Funing is scarred. The order has gradually been restored in Qian'an, Lulong, and Changli counties. The area east of the Shi River is still within the sphere of influence of Japanese and Korean ronin and cannot be rectified. Yin Shousong, the magistrate of Linyu County, has been dismissed by the provincial government for ineffective handling of affairs, and Yuan Tai has been appointed to take over. The discipline of the Liu Zuozhou unit of the security team reorganized from Li Jichun's troops is poor, and the provincial government has also issued strict orders for rectification. Since Malanyu was occupied by Japanese and puppet troops on October 22, although our side has negotiated with the Japanese side, and the Japanese side has stated that they will withdraw immediately, there is still no sign of withdrawal. A Japanese regiment is stationed there, led by Captain Hirasawa Kiichi. Three companies of puppet troops are stationed, one in Tashan, one in Dongling, and one in Tashan School. The Japanese and puppet troops stationed there claim to be protecting the imperial tombs, but in reality, they are actively building barracks and purchasing more than ten mu of civilian land to build a large-scale airfield, with the intention of making the area an air force base to control North China.

<p>Jinan Correspondence: Feng Yuxiang fought against the Japanese in Chahar, but did not achieve his ambition. Due to circumstances, he left Chahar and came south again, settling in Mount Tai. Song Zheyuan had dispatched a portion of his 29th Army, about 3,000 men, to escort Feng to Mount Tai, stationed on the mountain and in Taian County. The cavalry battalion of Sun Tongxuan's 20th Division of Han Fuju's 3rd Route Army, which was originally stationed in the area, was relocated to Dawenkou due to the arrival of Feng's guards in Mount Tai. At the beginning of Feng's arrival in Mount Tai, the finances were very difficult. Although Song Zheyuan and Han Fuju occasionally provided assistance, it was not enough in reality. Therefore, the troops in Mount Tai had no salary other than daily meals. Even Feng's key personnel received only twenty yuan a month for living expenses. Feng's financial straits being as such, he had no choice but to cut expenses to maintain the status quo. Last month, Feng had dismissed more than 400 soldiers stationed in Mount Tai, transported them to Jinan, and given each person two yuan to return to their hometown. Recently, Feng decided that since there were still about 2,000 soldiers stationed in Mount Tai, and it was difficult to pay them, and he himself was reading books in the mountains and did not ask about politics, there was no need for so many troops. Therefore, he decided to leave only a very small number in Mount Tai to serve as guards, and return the rest to Chahar Province. Therefore, he telegraphed Song Zheyuan a few days ago, urging him to send someone to Mount Tai to take command of the troops stationed in Mount Tai and return them to Chahar.</p>
<p>After receiving the telegram, Song Zheyuan sent Liu Ruming and Zhang Zhizhong to Shandong to handle the matter, and telegraphed Feng in Taian and Han Fuju in Jinan. Liu and Zhang arrived in Jinan this morning (4th) by train from Beiping at 8:15 PM. After getting off the train, Liu and Zhang first went to the municipal government to rest and met with Feng's secretary, Li Xin. Then, they went to the provincial government to meet with Han Fuju to convey Song Zheyuan's intentions and discuss the transportation of the troops stationed in Mount Tai. Tomorrow morning (5th), they will take a train to Mount Tai to meet Feng. It is estimated that the troops stationed in Mount Tai will be transported to Chahar soon. (4th)</p>

At the time, Xiong Shihui, director of the headquarters, represented Chiang Kai-shek and various dignitaries, welcoming him at the airfield. After disembarking, Lan, accompanied by his secretary and translator, a total of four people, shook hands with Xiong as a courtesy, and then took a car prepared by the headquarters to Jiang's residence outside the city to meet Chiang. That evening, Chiang hosted a banquet at his private residence to welcome Lan, which dispersed only at midnight. According to official claims, Lan's visit was to bid farewell to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, and he will leave for Nanjing via Shanghai in one day. (December 4th)</p>

<p>Nanchang Correspondence: The Jiangxi Provincial Association of All Circles of People for Joint Suppression of Bandits is making steady progress in the military suppression of bandits and communists. As for the recovery of bandit-occupied areas and other joint suppression matters, they all require sufficient funds to be handled thoroughly. In order to raise a large amount of money, it is proposed to issue prize-winning bonds. Merchants such as Wang Wenqing are willing to contract with the association, and the Shanghai Xinyi Company will handle it. The prize-winning bonds are divided into three types: A, with a quota of 40,000 numbers, the first prize is 40,000 silver dollars, with a total of more than 6,000 prizes; B, also with a quota of 40,000 numbers, the first prize is 20,000 silver dollars. This plan has already been drafted and submitted by the Joint Suppression Association to the provincial government for approval. The provincial government believes that the issuance of prize-winning bonds is an important matter and cannot be taken lightly, and ordered the contracting merchants Wang Wenqing and others to deposit the full amount of prize money into a reliable bank and publish an announcement in the newspaper to demonstrate credibility, and then submit it to the headquarters for verification before it can be issued.

<p>Since Chairman Chiang Kai-shek personally led the national army to supervise the suppression of communist bandits, in view of the fact that not all members of the Communist Party are stubborn and incorrigible, and that many are forced to join, he decided to use seven parts political force and only three parts military force as the decisive strategy for eliminating communist bandits. Since its implementation, not only has military progress been made step by step, but the use of political force has also been very effective. Therefore, many young people in the Communist Party have become self-aware and surrendered, as has been repeatedly reported in newspapers. Now, the Communist Zou Chunsheng has also surrendered and published an account of his joining the Communist Party and a declaration of leaving the Communist Party, which shows a glimpse of the Communist Party's deception of the people under false pretenses. The following is a transcript:</p>
<h3 id="e124">Joining Process <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>"In 1926, the Revolutionary Army arrived in Jiangxi, and I joined the Communist Party. In 1927, I was transferred back to Gaoan (my county) to serve as the county party secretary. After the failure of the Nanchang Uprising, I fled to the countryside. (My family) hid me in the countryside for two years. During these two years, I suffered the misfortune of family ruin and death (my mother died for me). At that time, I was young and impulsive, which led to a manic illness. After half a year of recovery, I came to Beiping in 1927 to take the entrance exam for the Chinese University. I looked everywhere for the Communist Party organization, but after several months, there was still no organizational relationship. I gave up my studies and secretly worked as a rickshaw puller for several months. In 1930, when the Jiang-Yan War broke out, Yang (?) introduced me to the Committee Against Warlord Infighting. Later, I was discovered by the authorities when I presided over a mass rally against warlord infighting. That night, I was arrested in my apartment and taken to the Public Security Bureau. After two months, I was transferred to the Guard Command. After three months, I was interrogated several times in the Guard Department. Later, because Yan Xishan escaped, I was released from prison. After being released from prison, my emotions became more agitated and my actions became more active. Yang introduced me to the Communist Party again. Not long after joining the party, I served as the secretary of the Chinese University branch, and then as the secretary of the Anti-Imperialist Party Group in Beiping. In March 1931, (?) I served as the secretary of the Eastern District Committee of the Communist Party. In July, I fled to Shanghai after the authorities discovered me (introduced by the Communist Party). After arriving in Shanghai, I could not find an organization because the Communist Party contact was not working well. In October, I risked returning to Beiping. After returning to Beiping, I became a worker again. Soon after, I served as the Minister of Workers of the Beiping Municipal Committee of the Communist Party, and later as the Secretary of the Beiping Municipal Committee of the Communist Party, concurrently serving as the Provincial Workers' Committee of the Communist Party in Hebei. In July 1932, I was transferred to serve as the Secretary of the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party (at this time, I became a key central cadre of the Communist Party in Hebei). In November 1932, after Huang Ping, a communist, came to Tianjin to inspect the labor movement and was arrested, I was sent back to Beiping. At first, I served as a staff member of the Organization Department of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party (I actually took on the task of the minister due to the illness of the organization minister). Later, I served as the chairman of the Training Committee of the Hebei Provincial Committee (this work is extremely important in the Communist Party). Later, I served as a roving commissioner of the Hebei Provincial Committee. After the Zhangjiakou Incident, the central representative of the Communist Party felt that the Zhangjiakou Communist Party Forward Committee was politically weak, so I was immediately transferred to Zhangjiakou to serve as the Provincial Committee (serving as the secretary and organization minister in the Forward Committee). After the failure of Zhangjiakou, I left with the team. During this encirclement of the team, I left the team with difficulty due to my responsibility. I arrived in Beiping on October 18th. I was arrested that day. After being arrested, I deeply felt the fundamental error of the Communist Party's understanding of the Chinese revolution. I asked the authorities to give me a new life. Later, I was given a new life by the authorities who did not pursue the past. Today, I have obtained the path of self-renewal and vow to stand under the leadership of the Three Principles of the People and work to complete the national revolution. Zou Chunsheng</p>
<h3 id="e125">Declaration of Leaving the Party <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>"Comrades of the Chinese Communist Party, fellow compatriots, I, who have been deceived by the Communist Party for many years, now declare that I am breaking away from all relations with the Communist Party and faithfully standing under the leadership of the Three Principles of the People, resolutely doing anti-communist work and fighting to complete the revolution. My resolute departure from the Communist Party this time is definitely not out of fear of death and seeking life, selling the party and seeking glory, nor is it like the comrades of the Communist Party who are now coldly laughing and scolding that 'Old Zou is a traitor to the proletariat.' 'Old Zou will always be an enemy of the revolution,' nor is it like what friends are laughing at, 'How can weak-willed Old Zou do the work of the Communist Party?' Comrades of the Communist Party, dear friends, my departure this time is because I am faithful to the revolution and carry out my oath to stand on the side of the people to seek the liberation of the people. My transformation this time is the result of my long-term pain and practical life in pursuing the fundamental problem of the Chinese revolution, and it is from the political perspective that a new awareness has emerged. That is, my deep exploration of the policies and actions implemented by the Communist Party for the Chinese revolution makes it impossible for me to follow the Communist Party blindly. The Chinese Communist Party's fundamental misunderstanding of the Chinese revolution and the unsuitability of communism for China, these basic issues, can be seen at a glance by anyone who understands Chinese history, politics, and social conditions. China is a fragmented country, and all phenomena from primitive to modern exist in a complex society. The entire nation is in a state of poverty, externally suffering from imperialist aggression and internally suffering from the disasters of feudal forces. The power of China's new industry is like finding a needle in a haystack, and the future development of national capital is constantly being hit by the above two reactionary forces, making Chinese society still in a semi-colonial and feudal hell. At present, the requirements of the Chinese state and society are to strive for equal international status, realize democratic politics, and eliminate the overall poverty of the Chinese people. Then, the basic task of the Chinese revolution at present is to overthrow imperialism, overthrow feudal forces, and strive for production and construction. This is the basic understanding of the Chinese revolution. However, the Chinese Communist Party, in order to be loyal to Red Imperialism and seek help from the Third International, has brought unworkable communism to China to practice, and inhuman policies to China to act. What class struggle and Soviet revolution are nothing but a thorough destruction of society, making the Chinese people forever trapped in poverty and exile beyond remedy, and making China move from a semi-colonial state to destruction. If we talk about the political line of the Chinese Communist Party being correct, then why did Chen Duxiu's opportunism, Li Lisan's adventurism, and Qu Qiubai's reconciliationism emerge? These phenomena are all the sins of Chen, Li, and Qu, but they prove that everything that the Chinese Communist Party has implemented in China is unworkable. Saying that the Chinese Communist Party is leading the people to overthrow imperialism is even more of a laughing matter. Since the September 18th Incident, the crisis of the Chinese nation has become more urgent day by day. At this critical juncture of national survival, the Chinese Communist Party is implementing a conspiracy to destroy the national united front and sacrifice national interests. Every time Japanese imperialist aircraft and cannons launch a fierce offensive, the Communist Party carries out destructive work on the front and rear lines of the anti-Japanese war. In the rear, they direct the Red Army to 'attack the route' and under the slogan of 'expanding the Soviet area,' they fiercely attack the national army, preventing the national army from being transferred north to resist Japan. On the front line, they organize mutinies in the national army, and in Beiping, Tianjin, and Tangshan, they incite general strikes by workers, and in eastern Hebei, they arrange peasant uprisings, attempting to disrupt the anti-Japanese battlefield and disperse the anti-Japanese forces of the national army and the people. The Zhangjiakou Incident was caused by the Hebei Communist Party using Feng Yuxiang to split the anti-Japanese forces, so that the Kuomintang Central Government could not go all out to resist Japan. Even more shamefully, they use the name of fake anti-Japanese war, on the one hand, to incite the people and soldiers to oppose the Kuomintang and the Nanjing government, and on the other hand, to collude with Japan to seize Beiping, Tianjin, and North China. Compatriots from all walks of life, how can we talk about going all out to resist Japan as long as the Communist Party exists? Some people say that the Communist Party is seeking the interests of the working people. This is another shameless propaganda of the Communist Party to the people. The Communist Party's labor movement, peasant movement, soldier movement, and student movement are nothing but bloodless means of killing people by the Communist Party. It incites workers to conduct unconscious strikes, resulting only in workers losing their jobs and being arrested. It incites peasants to resist rent and taxes for no reason, and even incites peasants to arm themselves and carry out riots, destroying the countryside, resulting in families being broken up, fleeing, and losing their lives. It incites anti-Japanese soldiers to go on strike and carry out mutinies in order to fulfill its conspiracy to destroy the anti-Japanese war and save the country. But the result is that the soldiers are either shot or have no way to survive. General young students are deceived by the Communist Party due to their patriotic enthusiasm, and as a result, they have not achieved patriotism but have become a sacrifice of the Communist Party. What kind of thing is the sacred and inviolable Soviet revolution? Let's take a look at the so-called Soviet area. The Soviet area is truly a hell on earth, an irredeemable mundane world. The scene in the Soviet area is only to see fields abandoned, young and old are separated, and young men are forced to become soldiers under the Communist Party's slogan of 'expanding' 'expanding a million iron Red Army' and become cannon fodder for the Communist Party. Beautiful girls are helplessly living the life of one woman and ten thousand men under the coercion of the Communist Party. The shameless Communist Party also says that it organizes women's nursing comfort teams for the revolution. Comrades of the Chinese Communist Party, you must resolutely liberate yourselves from the myth of the Soviet Union! Regarding the darkness in the Communist Party, that is a thousand layers upon layers. I hope that the comrades of the Communist Party will examine themselves. As a result of the examination, you will know what kind of life you are living in the Communist Party now. Comrades of the Chinese Communist Party, fellow compatriots, the national crisis is now imminent. The land of China is about to be cut up by imperialist robbers. It is a time of deep water and hot fire, which cannot be remedied. Let us unite, unite under the leadership of the Three Principles of the People, and fight to complete the national revolution.

<p>Zhao Shunsheng, a farmer from Jiangjialu Town, Nanhui County, had a grudge against the ruffian Zhou Huojin and others due to monetary disputes. At 2:00 AM the day before yesterday, Zhou Huojin suddenly led Xiaobeijing and Titousiwu, among four or five others, rushed to his house, each wielding sharp axes, and started chopping randomly at anyone they saw. Zhao Shunsheng was chopped to death in the kitchen. Zhao's eldest son, Longxiang, managed to escape, but was chased and chopped to death by Xiaobeijing by the river. Zhao's wife, Huang, and second son, Linxiang, and daughter, Guizhen, were also seriously injured. Huang died soon after. After committing the crime, the murderers fled one after another. Later, Zhu Genshan, an investigation police officer from the Public Security Bureau, in coordination with the 2nd District Security Corps, searched in all directions. Zhou Huojin was captured yesterday morning in a graveyard west of the town. Xiaobeijing fled to Chuansha in the afternoon and was detained by the 5th District Security Corps of that county. The 2nd District Security Corps of this county was notified to send personnel to escort him back to the corps. The 2nd District Office reported the criminals to the county for interrogation, and the county committee sent an adjudicator to conduct an inquest on the victims' bodies today (5th day).</p>

<p>During the current winter defense period, the military and police agencies have been conducting strict patrols of the city and countryside, and the local area is considered peaceful. However, at 7:00 AM on the 6th, when the Liguan Post Office in this city opened for business, two rifle bullets were found in the post office mailbox. Where they came from and what the intention was is a matter of great concern. The bureau had previously been robbed of a large sum of money, and there is concern that bandits are causing trouble. The bullets have been sent to the County Public Security Bureau for investigation.</p>

<p>Shen Weiyang, the chief of the Public Security Bureau of Wu County, has been in office for two months and has a good reputation. He has strictly cracked down on smoking and gambling, greatly curbing the gambling atmosphere in Suzhou, which has made some people dissatisfied. Recently, Li Jinsheng and others, using their real names, filed a petition with the Department of Civil Affairs, accusing Shen of employing private individuals, engaging in improper conduct, neglecting the prohibition of smoking, and illegally requisitioning war supplies. They requested a thorough investigation. The Department of Civil Affairs is currently conducting a secret investigation, so Chief Shen has been passive in his attitude recently.</p>

<p>The dispute over the Xiaolikou vegetable market has caused shops to strike and oppose it. Currently, all vegetable vendors are unwilling to move into the market, and there is no possibility of breaking the deadlock. In order to calm the situation, the county government has transferred the collection of donations for the project to the Second Section of the County Government, effective immediately. The construction matters will still be handled by the Technical Office, and personnel will be sent to earnestly persuade the vendors to open the market as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Chen Leigong, a resident of Tongyun Road in this county, (also known as Chen Jiafeng, Chen Lei, and Yu Tian) usually specializes in handling lawsuits for others and colluding with quack doctor Su Wencai to report others for opium smoking for a living. Recently, Chen drafted a lawsuit and had Su Wencai come forward to report Shi Zhongya, the owner of Wanshun Goods Store outside Nanmen, for smoking. Chen first took the lawsuit to Shi's house to negotiate, demanding that he pay 40 yuan to avoid being reported. Shi's wife, Hu, agreed to meet and pay the money at the Gongyuan Hotel at 5:00 PM the day before yesterday. Chen Leigong arrived at the Gongyuan Hotel on time. Hu pretended to comply and took out 20 yuan in cash. Chen insisted on 40 yuan. While they were arguing, Hu's son, Bingyuan, called the police to the scene. Chen Leigong, along with Hu, were taken to the First Branch Bureau. Director Qin opened the court. Hu stated that Chen Leigong was extorting money, and the banknotes all had Yu's signature as proof. 20 yuan in cash was found on Chen, and it indeed had Hu's signature. Chen Leigong was ordered to be detained overnight and presented to the General Bureau yesterday, then transferred to the County Court. Chief Zhou opened the court for interrogation and ordered Chen Leigong to be taken into custody. Shi Hu was ordered to return home and await investigation.</p>

<p>Chen Guofu, the chairman of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, concurrently serves as the deputy director of the Huai River Diversion Committee. Because the second phase of the Huai River Diversion project needs to be started urgently, and the public has doubts about the proposal for a "people-into-the-sea" project and the order of the project's progress and the measures taken by the Huai River Diversion Committee, Chen specially invited Han Zilao, a respected elder and water conservancy expert from Jiangsu Province, to the provincial capital to discuss the matter in order to be cautious. Han arrived in Zhenjiang from Yangzhou yesterday morning and met with Chen at 2:00 PM. The conversation lasted for a long time. Chen expressed his adoption of Han's opinions. It is reported that the nature and location of the second phase of the project cannot be changed because the loan was designated for that purpose. However, the "people-into-the-sea" project will not be hindered. In the future, equal emphasis will be placed on both "entering the river" and "entering the sea" in order to comply with public opinion. If this is the case, then the people of Jiangbei, who have suffered from the disastrous flooding of the Huai River and the destruction of the canal for 20 years, as well as the massive disaster of the Yellow River breaching the canal this year, will be able to run around and call for opposition to the "Huai River into the river" project, and will hear the good news. Han stayed at the Wanquan Building yesterday. Today, Chairman Chen invited him to lunch at the provincial residence. In addition to inviting all members of the provincial government to attend, he also invited local gentry Leng Yuqiu to accompany them.</p>
<h3 id="e140">Under the Tyrannical Power of the Chongming Authorities, the Mainstay of Chongming Commentary is Arrested <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>Since the abolition of the publicly and secretly operated drug investigation bureau in this county, powerful figures from all walks of life have secretly been organizing drug manufacturing facilities. For a time, society was in an uproar, and the newspapers all had detailed reports. Among them, the Chongming Commentary Weekly was particularly able to expose all the corrupt political achievements and dark secrets from the perspective of the people, and dare to condemn them in words and writing without the slightest hesitation. Its commentary on the manufacture of drugs was even more forthright and uncompromising. Therefore, the publication was popular for a time and enjoyed great trust from people in society. However, on the evening of the 5th of the month, the captain of the 17th Squadron of the Chongming Waterborne Public Security Bureau suddenly led 40 or 50 men to arrest Lu Ping, the mainstay of the newspaper, and send him to the County Public Security Bureau. At that time, public opinion was in turmoil, and no one knew why he was arrested. Later, a reporter went to the Public Security Bureau to inquire. Director Li told the reporter that Lu was arrested and escorted by the Waterborne Public Security Team. According to the official document that the captain submitted afterwards, the reason for the arrest was defamation. In the third issue of the newspaper, in an open letter of sincere advice to the New Chong Daily, there were the following words: "New Chong Daily editors and reporters, if you go out and walk around the streets, you can always hear news about the Xisha Red Pill manufacturing factory, and what is even more surprising and you must be able to hear is that the owners of the Red Pill manufacturing factory are County Magistrate Gong, Captain, and several others. New Chong Daily editors and reporters, who boast of recording everything they hear, why don't you publish it? Could it be that you haven't heard it? No, you definitely haven't heard it, because the rumors are unreliable and they would never do such despicable and lowly things, so you don't publish it. That's right, this publication also believes that this kind of thing is absolutely not true, so even though there have been submissions commenting on this kind of thing, they have not been published. Colleagues can know that 'recording everything they hear' contains a very important condition, that is, what is heard must have at least a ×% certainty before it has any value for publication." It is also heard that the County Public Security Bureau will transfer the case to the County Judiciary for interrogation this afternoon (6th). However, after the occurrence of this case, people in society all believe that the Waterborne Public Security Team's arbitrary arrest of people is illegal. Moreover, with regard to the above-mentioned content published in the newspaper, whether it constitutes defamation is something that anyone who knows a little about writing can understand. Now, at a time when the country is protecting news reporters under a clear order, they have become ashamed and angry, disregarding the law and wanting to control public opinion and block the people's voices. Therefore, the local people are incensed by this injustice and have organized a Lu case support association preparatory committee. In addition to strongly advocating to the authorities, they are also appealing to all parties to preserve justice.</p>

<p>Zhou Chenfang, a farmer from Sangshutou in the 5th District of the county, has been kidnapped by bandits for more than a month. Although the bandits have repeatedly demanded a ransom, his family has been unable to do anything. A few days ago, when the bandit suppression troops were conducting a rescue, the bandits severely beat Chenfang and cut off his left ear with a knife, abandoning him in the wilderness. Only then was he able to escape back.</p>

<h3 id="e147">Brief Biography of Mr. Marconi <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>Guglielmo Marconi, an Italian electrical engineer, is famous in the world for inventing wireless telegraphy. He was born in Bologna on April 25, 1874. In his youth, he studied under Professor Righi, a student of Leggiero. He then entered the University of Bologna, where he was influenced by Professor Righi, who was enthusiastic about researching the electric waves discovered by Hertz. Therefore, Marconi had the idea of using electric waves to transmit messages. As a result of his research, he improved various receivers. In 1895, he went to Griffon to conduct experiments on wireless telegraphy, which were very successful. The chief engineer of the British Telegraph, Preece, also praised Marconi's new method after testing it. Soon after, the Italian Navy also tested Marconi's wireless telegraphy. In 1897, the Marconi Wireless Telegraph Company was established. In 1899, England and France were able to communicate across the English Channel. Marconi's telegraph was widely used by the navies of both England and Italy. In 1903, Marconi transmitted American news to the London Times. In the same year, the "Lucania" ship was able to get world news at all times in the Atlantic Ocean, without interruption throughout the entire journey. By 1904, Cunard Company ships were publishing European and American news dailies while crossing the sea. Its application in the business world began in 1907. Marconi is not only a businessman, but the development of his business is the result of his lifelong research. He has never relaxed his spirit of progress because of his great success. In 1906, he invented a direct communication method and set up a new method of sending continuous waves. In 1910, Mr. and Mrs. Marconi (photographed by Gong Shuxian)</p>
<p>invented a new type of piston receiver and electro-hydraulic detector. He also devised a way to make the transmitting and receiving machines mutually transmit and receive at extremely high speeds, and the effect was as if they were simultaneously receiving and transmitting. Therefore, two messages could be sent back and forth at the same time, which is similar to the principle of multi-channel wired telegraphy. Marconi Company's telecommunications reach everywhere. Its station in Argentina can receive signals from Ireland and Nova Scotia, and its distance is no less than five or six thousand miles. Extending it to other stations in South America, the total length can reach seven thousand miles. Italy joined the war in 1915, and Marconi became the director of the Italian government's wireless telegraph administration. He was awarded the Grand Cross by the King of Italy and honors from England, France, and other countries. In 1904, he received honorary degrees from Oxford and Glasgow Universities. In 1909, he and Braun shared the Nobel Prize in Physics. Marconi's contribution to the world and the world's respect for inventors can be seen from this.</p>

<p>The Damer Morning News reported that at the second annual meeting of the British Association of China last night (5th) at the Race Club, Chairman Arnold suggested in his speech that after the new British ambassador, Sir Miles Lampson, arrives in China, he should be requested to reside in Shanghai or Nanjing, because most British merchants trade in Shanghai or control it from Shanghai. In addition, the ambassador to China should have close contact with the Nanjing government, and since Nanjing and Shanghai are close, there is a need for the British ambassador's residence to move south from Beiping. In addition, Arnold did not approve of the British government's decision to withdraw a battalion of British troops stationed in Shanghai and hoped that the authorities would reconsider. He also mentioned the problem of unemployment among British expatriates in Shanghai and urged various groups to provide relief. Finally, the association passed the Wu Yi Hai proposal to improve the method of electing officers and adjourned.</p>

<h3 id="e152">Representatives Arriving in Shanghai <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>

<h3 id="e153">Preliminary Meeting <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, with more than half of the attending representatives, a preliminary meeting was convened first. In addition to the above-mentioned representatives, the attendees also included Wu Huanru and Zhou Minggang, representatives of the Municipal Government; Gu Xinyi, Zhu Zixiang, Jiang Zisheng, Yan Xiaoquan, Cai Yukun, Chen Ziyi, Zhu Yunzhang, and Jiang Hongbin, representatives of the Bean and Rice Industry Association; and Feng Yongsheng, Chen Shide, and Fu Changyu, representatives of the Grain Industry Association, more than 20 people.</p>
<h3 id="e154">Mr. Gu's Report <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>After the formalities, temporary Chairman Gu Xinyi gave a report, stating that the convening of this conference was based on the grain conference convened at Chiang Kai-shek's headquarters in Nanchang. We are aware that the bankruptcy of Chinese rural areas is largely due to the uneven regulation of grain. Rice-producing areas are unable to export their surplus rice, while rice-deficient areas have no way to seek supplies, resulting in price differences, which have a very negative impact on the people's food supply. Therefore, foreign rice takes the opportunity to invade, resulting in a huge outflow of cash every year. It is proposed to levy a 90% tax on foreign rice in order to make up for this. Therefore, once the foreign rice tax is implemented, the demand for domestic rice in rice-deficient areas can be increased. Then the adjustment of production and sales also seems to be imminent. Now, it is proposed to combine the official and commercial power of eight provinces and cities to jointly organize a grain production and sales agency. However, the organization of this agency requires funding. Chiang Kai-shek has approved a government loan of one million yuan, and each province and city will raise another one million yuan. The remaining amount will be handled by the silver and money industry through mortgage or loan, with the lowest possible interest rate. In terms of transportation, the lowest possible water power will be used, sufficient to cover its coal and water costs without incurring losses. At the closing of the Nanchang conference, the representatives unanimously agreed to further discuss concrete measures. Now, all the plans have been drafted and submitted to Chiang Kai-shek for approval, who believes they can be implemented. Therefore, this city has telegraphed to invite representatives from various provinces and cities to Shanghai to discuss the matter in detail. Although not all attendees can be present, we already have a majority, so we will first hold a preparatory meeting to allow the representatives of the provinces and cities to express their high opinions first, so that all the issues can be resolved smoothly at tomorrow's formal meeting.</p>
<h3 id="e155">Exchange of Opinions <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>Following the chairman's report, representatives from various provinces and cities provided detailed reports on their respective provinces' engagement situations. They engaged in extensive discussions regarding future strategies, generally reaching a consensus. They agreed that grain production and marketing organizations were essential, deeming them best operated through joint public-private ventures, as opposed to solely by the government or merchants. They also agreed to exert full effort to facilitate the establishment of such organizations. The possibility of remedial measures for the provinces of Fujian and Guangdong, should they not participate in the organizations, was also discussed. Therefore, all issues brought up for discussion during today's formal meeting are expected to proceed smoothly.</p>

<p>According to inquiries made by a reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency as of yesterday, representatives from Hubei, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Hankou, Anhui, and other provinces and cities had successively arrived in Shanghai to report. However, Guangdong had previously telegraphed Shanghai stating that it had decided to discontinue sending representatives to attend the first meeting of the eight provinces and cities grain production and marketing cooperation. Chairman Chiang believed that since Guangdong had relinquished its representative responsibility, the eight provinces and cities grain production and marketing cooperation organization could not live up to its name. Therefore, he specially added Henan Province, and simultaneously telegraphed the provincial authorities of Henan, requesting them to promptly send representatives to Shanghai to participate. According to a telegram from the Henan provincial authorities, the representatives appointed have already departed for Shanghai and are expected to arrive this morning, ensuring they will be able to attend the first meeting convened at 9 AM today.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Architectural Association, due to the Ministry of Finance's Tax Bureau implementing an increased consolidated tax on cement from the 5th of this month, raising the tax from the original 60 cents per barrel to 1.20 yuan per barrel, causing prices to soar, various member construction factories, unable to bear this significant loss, have requested discussions on coping methods. Therefore, a joint extraordinary executive and supervisory committee meeting was convened yesterday. Committee members Tao Guilin, Xie Bingheng, Chen Songling, Sun Weiming, Yin Xinzhi, Du Yange, and others were in attendance. All agreed that the increased tax had not been included in the valuation of ongoing contracted projects by various construction factories, making it difficult to bear the loss. A resolution was passed that the outstanding increased consolidated tax should be borne by the property owners. The association has already notified member factories and architects and engineers accordingly.</p>

<p>According to Xin Xin News Agency, since the Fujian Incident, the central government has paid close attention to the safety of the sea areas off Fujian and Zhejiang. On the one hand, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was ordered to liaise with the ambassadors and consuls of various countries in China to formally implement a blockade in the future. On the other hand, the Ministry of the Navy was ordered to strictly inspect ships sailing to Fujian to prevent the transportation of military supplies. A reporter from Xin Xin News Agency has learned that the naval authorities have already ordered a blockade of shipping to Fujian yesterday. It is also reported that the ships of the China Merchants and other companies sailing to Fujian have also suspended operations. As for foreign ships sailing to Fujian, because the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has not yet completed negotiations with the countries concerned, this prohibition does not currently apply to them. However, before foreign ships sailing to Fujian enter the port, they must be subject to strict inspection by the central government warships in case of emergencies. It is understood that the central government has deployed a total of nine warships in the Fujian and Zhejiang area.</p>

According to Director Ji Zejin of the Guidance Department of the Trade Bureau, Mr. Fox's purpose in coming to China this time is to promote the country's cotton. Egypt produces a wealth of cotton every year, but domestic demand is limited, so it is seeking to promote sales in China to make adjustments. As for Mr. Fox's investigation in Qingdao, Hankou, and other places, he has arrived in Nanjing and is expected to return to Shanghai in about ten days. As for the rumors that Mr. Fox's mission in China is to set up a commercial visiting bureau in Shanghai, it is actually inaccurate.</p>

<h3 id="e172">Cigarette Manufacturers Hold Representative Meeting Yesterday, Resolving to Purchase and Affix New Stamps Immediately, Requesting Government to Allot Subsidy <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>Cigarette manufacturers in this city, due to the Ministry of Finance's Tax Bureau implementing newly set consolidated taxes from the 5th of this month, requested a postponement, which was not approved. The industry association held a representative meeting yesterday, deciding to accept the new tax with a heavy heart and pay taxes according to regulations, but requesting the government to allot a portion of the new tax revenue to relieve cigarette factories and subsidize their development. The details are recorded below.</p>
<h3 id="e173">New Tax Measures <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance's Tax Bureau issued a notice to all cigarette factories stating, "To: Regarding the revision of the consolidated tax rate for domestically produced cigarettes, the order to implement it from December 5th has been received. This bureau has already sent the newly set tax amount limit price in a letter on the 2nd of this month for compliance. This tax increase, for cigarette packages that have affixed old tax stamps before December 5th, has been reported to the supervisor for factory release in accordance with regulations. For cigarette packages sold in this city, regardless of whether the cigarettes are sold after the implementation of the new tax form, the registered selling price should still be taxed according to the original grade or be reduced if the application is approved. In order to ensure that the value of the old stamp is more or less than the tax amount due for the new second grade, all are allowed to be sold uniformly. In the event of slow sales and change of transportation, the local consolidated tax bureau should be reported to for the issuance of a change of transportation certificate, so that the change of transportation can be carried out. However, in the event of re-packaging, stamp removal, or sales in non-consolidated tax areas, when requesting a tax refund, except for those whose original old tax stamp value is lower than the new second-grade tax amount due, the tax refund will still be based on the original stamp price. Those whose original old tax stamp value is higher than the new second-grade tax amount due should only be allowed to refund the new tax amount due for the cigarette to prevent fraud. In addition to the distribution, the revised cigarette consolidated tax rate table is enclosed for reference. Please refer to the tax rate table, with 50,000 cigarettes as the standard: Grade 1: selling price above 300 yuan, tax 160 yuan; Grade 2: selling price below 300 yuan, tax 80 yuan. Note: The maximum selling price of Grade 2 cigarettes, non-cigarette factory location, is allowed to be relaxed by 20 yuan, not exceeding 320 yuan. The maximum selling price of Grade 1 cigarettes is not limited."</p>
<h3 id="e174">Not a Work Stoppage <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>Since the news of the tax increase spread, it was suddenly reported that 42 cigarette factories had jointly signed a contract on the 4th and announced a work stoppage on the 5th to protest. According to a reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency, after investigating various factories yesterday, it was learned that there are a total of 53 Chinese cigarette factories in this city. Large-scale factories such as Nanyang and Huacheng are working as usual and have not stopped working. However, factories such as Zhongnan, Sanxing, Xinmin, Jiangzhe, Kunlun, Jiangnan, Changming, Minzhong, Ruilun, Delong, Huadong, Zhonghe, Huabei, Huapin, etc., because before the new tax was implemented on the 5th, all cigarette paper shops and other vendors had purchased in bulk to speculate, resulting in a sudden excess of demand over supply. The factories worked day and night to rush production, but the inventory was still sold out. After the 5th, the cigarette paper shops had sufficient stock and temporarily stopped purchasing, while the factories changed to day and night shifts, and the workers also felt tired, so they temporarily stopped working or opened a part, waiting for the market to turn around before resuming the original state. If it is said to be a protest against the tax increase, it is inevitable to misunderstand. Also, foreign companies such as British American Tobacco Company, Factory 1, 2, 3, etc., are also working as usual.</p>
<h3 id="e175">No Purchase of New Stamps <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>According to the industry, the various cigarette merchants' principles on the government's tax increase, due to the poor market conditions, have requested a temporary postponement. Whether manufacturers start or stop work has nothing to do with business. The most important thing is the inspection of goods when they leave the factory. Every time goods leave the factory, they are checked and released by the resident staff sent by the Consolidated Tax Bureau to each factory. Due to the accumulation of inventory from the double work on the 5th and 6th, all inventory had left the factory before the 5th of this month and was stored in warehouses for wholesale. Various sales agents are still operating as usual. Because various manufacturers still have new goods in stock that have not been released, no new stamps were purchased yesterday. The inspection office of the Tax Bureau in Nine Mu Land, Nanshi, was extremely crowded before the 5th, and the staff was very busy.

<p>According to Mr. Lang of the Cigarette Factory Industry Association, the various cigarette merchants, before the new tax was implemented, requested the Ministry of Finance that, for the government's economic problems, the merchants could, as much as possible, pre-approve the purchase of stamps, and did not set how much each company would lend to the government. Now, reports say that Nanyang has approved 500,000 yuan, British American Tobacco has approved 2 million yuan, and Huacheng has approved 300,000 yuan as government loans. The Industry Association absolutely denies this. As for Yu Qiaqing and Du Yuesheng taking on the role of mediation, because the industry has not yet requested it, no mediation has been carried out.</p>

<p>The Chinese Cigarette Manufacturers Association, due to the increase in tax rates, repeatedly requested a postponement of implementation, which was not approved. Therefore, at 2:30 PM yesterday afternoon, an emergency representative meeting was convened at the meeting place on Meibaige Road. Those who attended included Wu Tingsheng, Wu Gensheng, Shen Weiting, Yu Jiqin, Wang Qiuquan, Lu Wensun, Wang Xingtang, Wu Shentai, Bao Guangsheng, Jiang Lanting, Zhang Shankun, and Datong Wang Zijin, Asia Peng Zijin, Huaqing Sun, Fuyun Yongli Shi Chao Xiang, Da Zhonghua Chen Dehong, Cuiquan Wang Weilin, Changming Wang Yunfu, Huamei Yu Zhong'e, Shanghai Han Xushan, Minzhong Wu Xiaogan, Xinmin Lin Zicai, Lihua Xu Quanfu, Jiuyi Zheng Songru, Jinshan Yin Shunfei, Huada Hong Wei Guan, Kunlun Yu Lunxian, Da Dongnan Qiu Genglin, Zhang Xinliang, Huadong Li Xuelai, Huacheng Shen Xingde, Kefu Zhang Yunqing, Huaxin Wang Zhongying, Jiangzhe Liu Jiyun, Dexing Tao Wenkui, Fuxing Ding Boquan, Huachang Zhu Wenzhun, Nanyang Wu Tingsheng, Daizhongnan Shen Yankang, Delong Chen Xihong, etc., more than 50 people, chaired by Wu Tingsheng.</p>

<p>After the meeting opened, Chairman Wu Tingsheng first reported on the tax increase, the previous petitions to the Ministry of Finance, and the negotiations on the return of moldy cigarettes, restrictions on factory locations, and investigations of smuggled cigarettes. Next, Yu Jiqin spoke, saying that giving a 10% discount on the new tax first and then purchasing it in full is harmful to small factories, and it is better to directly implement the new tax. Then, Ding Boquan and others reported on the current situation. After discussion, a unanimous vote was passed: (1) Purchase new stamps immediately and affix them according to regulations; (2) Request the government to sympathize with the difficulties of businesses and allocate funds after the implementation of the new tax to be used for improving the business development or improvement of cigarette factories.</p>

<p>After the resolution was passed, representatives were immediately selected: Wu Tingsheng, chairman of the Chinese Cigarette Manufacturers Association, and members Bao Gengsheng and Shen Weiting, three people, personally went to the Ministry of Finance's Tax Bureau to request to see Director Xie Qi, but Xie had gone to Hangzhou and did not meet them. It was also 5 o'clock, which was past the regulations for office hours. The three representatives reported this intention to the tax bureau staff, and the tax bureau staff promised to submit this intention to the director for review and decision, and generally felt that there would be no problem.</p>

<p>Since the newly set tax amount for cigarettes was implemented on the 5th of this month, various cigarette factories have increased the selling prices of various cigarettes accordingly. As a result, the price of cigarettes in various cigarette paper shops has increased by about 2 copper coins for every 10-piece pack above 200 wen, and about 1 coin for those below 200 wen. A 50-piece pack has increased by 1 to 2 cents per tin. However, there are also those that have not increased in price, because the cigarettes sold in various cigarette paper shops are all inventory purchased before the 5th of this month.</p>
<h3 id="e181">New Tax Revenue <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>According to Wang, director of the cigarette section of the Consolidated Tax Bureau, and Zong, director of the accounting section, the average monthly special tax on cigarettes is about 5 million yuan, and the annual revenue is about 65 million yuan. After the Ministry of Finance newly revised the tax rate this time, it will increase by about one-third. If the situation of previous years is followed, it can increase revenue by more than 10 million yuan. As for how manufacturers express themselves, the Ministry of Finance will preside over the handling of it. This bureau is ordered to handle it, and unless the Ministry of Finance has other orders, it will definitely start collecting taxes according to the new tax rate.</p>

<p>In the most recent ten days, imports of Japanese goods have been extremely crowded. From the 25th of last month to yesterday, there have been six or seven Japanese ships arriving in Shanghai, loaded with Japanese goods, mainly cement, Dongtang, hardware and electrical materials, match stems, stone powder, and fabrics. There are also many seafood products. They are all transported from Rokko Maru, Mikasa, Aso Maru, etc. Each time, the number ranges from 16,000 to 17,000 pieces to 28,000 to 29,000 pieces. Seventy percent of them are unloaded in Shanghai warehouses, and two to three tenths are transferred to the Yangtze River, Changsha, and Sichuan. In total, the import of Japanese goods in this decade is more than 100,000 pieces. More than 30,000 pieces will arrive in Shanghai tomorrow and the day after tomorrow. There are also a large number of machine materials arriving. As for Japanese goods being transported to Europe and seizing our country's exports, such as soybeans, camphor, paper umbrellas, and Huzhou silk, these goods have recently been transported to Italy, causing our country's exports to Italy to plummet, all of which have been seized by Japanese goods. A large number of bicycles are also transported to Europe, selling for only 20 to 30 yuan per vehicle, so a large number are exported.</p>

<p>Two-thirds of the funds for slaughter improvement are allocated by the Municipal Finance Bureau to the Shanghai Fresh Meat Industry Association to request that two-thirds of the funds for slaughter improvement be allocated to donate to aviation and purchase the Shanghai Fresh Meat Aircraft. A special report was submitted to the municipal government for instructions. The municipal government instructed the bureau a few days ago to approve the temporary termination of the Slaughter Improvement Fund Management Committee. All slaughter funds, except for two-thirds of the funds allocated for aviation donation, the remaining one-third will be used for public welfare purposes of the industry. The methods are as follows: (1) After the full amount of the aviation donation is allocated, all funds should still be used for the public welfare of the meat industry, and the competent authority will manage them separately, and the municipal government will supervise them; (2) The amount of the aviation donation, as requested, will be negotiated by the meat industry association and the aviation association.</p>
<h3 id="e184">Announcement of Regulations for Collecting House Tax: Land Value Tax Has Been Implemented; Should Not Be Borne by Property Owners <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>The regulations for collecting land value tax in this city have long been announced and implemented by the municipal government. Previously, citizens Yao Wen and others, due to the inability to bear the burden after the war, jointly petitioned the Executive Yuan to approve the Shanghai Municipal Government to temporarily postpone implementation. If it is unavoidable and must be held, then citizen representatives should be added to the valuation committee, and the house tax should no longer be borne by the landlords. It was subsequently approved that the request to postpone the land value tax should not be discussed. However, regarding the candidates for the land valuation committee and the fact that the house tax should not still be borne by the landlords and tenants, the municipal government has been ordered to consider and handle it. The municipal government has now added citizen representatives to the valuation committee. As for how to handle the house tax, it has not yet been announced, so Yao and others have jointly petitioned the municipal government to announce the method as soon as possible to show fairness. The original report is recorded below, reporting that the land value tax has been implemented, and the house tax should no longer be borne by the landlords. It should be announced as soon as possible to comfort the public. In August of this year, the temporary land value tax regulations and implementation rules were promulgated by the government, and the date for implementation was set. The landlords and others, because they had just experienced the war, requested a strict implementation, and if it was unavoidable and had to be held, then the house tax item should no longer be borne by the landlords, so as to conform to the principle of equal taxation. It was reported to the Executive Yuan for approval, and the city's temporary land value tax regulations, which had been approved by the Yuan, and the request to postpone the handling should not be considered. As for the city's house tax, which should not still be borne by the landlords and tenants, the municipal government has been ordered to consider and handle it. This is in line with the decision of the municipal government meeting in the 18th year of the Republic of China that after the land tax law is promulgated in the future, the landlords will bear the land tax, and the tenants will bear the house tax. However, the land value tax, which was previously promulgated by the government, was set to be implemented on August 1 of this year, so it seems that the house tax borne by the landlords in the past should be announced to be stopped at the same time. Since the approval, more than a month has passed, and it has not been shown that not only has the autumn house tax been completely collected, but the winter tax has also been started. The landlords are very confused, so they jointly submit a report to the government for review and approval, and announce it clearly as soon as possible. The house tax from August of this year will no longer be borne by the landlords, and those that have already been collected will be allowed to be deducted from the land value tax to be paid, so as to fulfill the promises and comfort the public. We are extremely apprehensive and await orders. Protecting the report to the Shanghai Municipal Government, the reporters Yao Wenyan, etc.</p>
<h3 id="e185">City Chamber of Commerce and Others Telegraph Request to Protect Bank Mortgage Rights: Yufeng Yarn Factory Workers Forcibly Take Out Pledged Yarn; Failure to Stop This Would Amount to Severing the Lifeline of Industry <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>Since the Henan Yufeng Yarn Factory suspended operations due to losses, the workers' demands for resumption of work have led to prolonged and unresolved disputes. In the name of maintaining livelihoods, the workers forcibly took out yarn pledged to various Shanghai banks from the factory, intending to sell it off to distribute living expenses. The City Chamber of Commerce believes that this behavior by the workers of Henan Province infringes upon the mortgage rights of third parties. It has telegraphed the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Industry, and the Chairman of Henan Province, requesting strict correction to protect mortgage rights. The original telegram is recorded below: To the Nanjing Executive Yuan, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Industry, Chairman Liu of the Henan Provincial Government: The China, Shanghai, and Zhejiang Xingye Banks received floral yarn as collateral for loans to the Zhengzhou Yufeng Yarn Factory, stored in the factory's warehouse. Now, to provide workers with living expenses, the labor union, in conjunction with the mediation committee, forcibly took away 369 pieces of yarn pledged to the three banks and intends to sell them off. This infringes upon the mortgage rights of third parties due to the relationship between the workers and the factory, which violates the law. If creditor's rights are not protected in the future, who would dare to lend money, which would amount to severing the lifeline of industry. We implore you to correct this. Respectfully, the Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Banking Association has also telegraphed the Central Party Headquarters, the Executive Yuan, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, the Ministry of Industry, the Ministry of Finance, the Economic Commission, the Cotton Control Commission, Chairman Liu of Henan Province, and the Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce, appealing for the upholding of justice and immediate cessation of this action. The original telegram is recorded below (abbreviated): Respected Sirs: This is to inform you that our member, the China, Shanghai, and Zhejiang Xingye Banks, has stated in a letter that the Zhengzhou Yufeng Yarn Factory owes our three banks a substantial amount of loans, and the pledged floral yarn has always been stored in the Yufeng warehouse. The factory previously suspended operations due to losses, and the issue has remained unresolved for a long time. Now, according to a telegram from our Zhengzhou bank, the labor union, in conjunction with the mediation committee, suddenly forcibly took away 369 pieces of yarn stored as collateral with our bank, intending to sell them off to distribute living expenses, leaving our bank's creditor's rights unprotected. We request that you find a way to stop this from happening. Labor disputes at Yufeng should have avenues for resolution. The labor union's forcible removal of bank collateral without the local authorities stopping it will not only make it impossible for banks in the area to operate in the future, but also, at a time when the government and various provincial authorities are making efforts to promote construction and develop industry, how can we encourage banks to do their best to assist? If our government does not promptly stop this illegal action, banks will lose their security and will have no choice but to cease all industrial lending, the impact of which on the country's industrial future is unimaginable. Therefore, we appeal to you to instruct the Zhengzhou local authorities to promptly stop this and return the cotton yarn taken by the labor union, in its entirety. We earnestly hope for this and eagerly await your instructions. Respectfully, the Shanghai Banking Association.</p>

<p>According to news from the Regulatory Committee of the Silk and Satin Dyeing Industry Association, the Shanghai Silk and Satin Dyeing Industry Association previously experienced disturbances due to the labor side's request to restore the original wine allowance agreement. After several twists and turns, the dispute was mediated by the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs. In addition to the provisions of the 1927 wine allowance price list, the prices of other new products were given according to the industry's usual practice. The prices of some new products were stamped and sealed by a notary public. At the time, both parties agreed, and the association immediately notified the industry to comply with it. Not long after, the labor side opposed this, claiming that the capital side violated the contract. The association did not change the previous pricing regulations on the principle of the 1927 wine allowance contract. The association believes that the labor side's unreasonable dispute and reopening of the dispute is regrettable. In order to eliminate this dispute, the association convened an emergency meeting yesterday and issued the following declaration to make the society understand: Since the National Revolutionary Army established Shanghai and Nanjing in 1927, workers in various industries have begun to organize labor unions, and our industry is no exception. The labor and capital sides signed an agreement to abide by it. Later, due to the impact of the Shanghai War, various industries experienced economic pain, and our industry's dyeing prices were also reduced as a result, making it difficult to maintain operations. We then sought the consent of the workers to slightly change the original wine expenses. Last month, the Silk and Satin Dyeing Industry Office requested colleagues to increase wine allowances and went on strike for a long time. The Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs mediated the result, and it was handled in accordance with the original agreement of 1927. Not long after, the labor side suddenly reopened the dispute, claiming that colleagues had violated the contract. The colleagues have been implementing the mediation agreement of the Bureau of Social Affairs and have made no changes. However, the office made a big publicity in the newspapers, saying, "Please change your face, violate the law, and destroy the contract. If you do not immediately correct it, it will stimulate an extreme and daring trend that will not be difficult to see." Our association has been implementing the mediation agreement of the Bureau of Social Affairs, so how can there be any violation of the law? Where can it be corrected? It is not difficult to understand the cause of this dispute (omitted below). This is the declaration.</p>

<p>Yao Abing, age 32, a painter from Pudong, resides at No. 8, Alley 11, Xinjiang Road. He had been cohabiting with Wang Feng'e, a woman from Shaoxing, for several years. They had a very close relationship. However, recently, Wang became acquainted with Wu Dayou, a drummer in the world, who resides at No. 4, Xinnanli, Maris. They have been having secret rendezvous. Yao discovered this and was furious. He sent a letter to Wu with many threats. Wu was also unwilling to back down and replied with a letter, inviting Yao to meet. At around 10:30 last night, Yao went to Xinjiang Road to meet Wu as agreed. During the conversation, a dispute arose. At that time, Chinese patrol No. 2166 from the Huishi Patrol Station was passing by. Wu suddenly had an idea and deceptively reported to the patrol that Yao was a robber. Yao was anxious upon hearing this and ran away. Wu also followed and chased him. The patrol immediately drew his gun and fired, hitting Yao in the back. The bullet exited from his chest, causing him to fall. He was bleeding profusely. After the incident, patrol No. 2540 from the post helped transport him to Renji Hospital for treatment. His injuries are serious and his life is in danger. Wu Dayou was taken to the patrol station by the patrol and is being detained for investigation.</p>

<p>Xin Sheng News Agency reports that regarding the water cut-off dispute in Bailu, Baifu, and Baishou Lanes, after the owner, Deli Company, and the Real Estate Association sent representatives to petition the Public Works Department, a satisfactory result was not obtained. The residents of the lane reported that the British-owned Water Company not only cut off the Taiping fire hydrant in the lane but also closed the main water pipe of the Taiping fire hydrant on the road between Fenzhou Road and Pingliang Road. As a result, there was no water at all, and there was panic over the daily source of drinking water. In order to maintain their lives, the tenants, both men and women, old and young, jointly petitioned the owner, but the owner was unable to cope. Yesterday, they were forced to hire dozens of workers to set up dozens of large tanks in the lane to draw water from the Huangpu River for emergency use to temporarily maintain the status quo. However, the tenants said that the water from the Huangpu River was too dirty to use, resulting in a difficult stalemate. The owner claimed that this situation was caused by the Water Company disregarding safety. In order to fight for the righteousness of survival, they will not succumb to the high-pressure tactics of the Water Company, and they will spare no sacrifice.</p>

<h3 id="e202">Wing On Company Robbed: Small Leather Bag Snatched with Substantial Losses; Detectives Pursue and Arrest a Suspect <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>The Wing On Department Store on Nanjing Road has recently been having a sale, so customers are especially crowded. Many people are also shopping for Winter Solstice gifts. The daily operating revenue is huge, making it the top store among all the shops on Nanjing Road. At the same time, the company takes in a large amount of money and for the sake of speed and safety, it sends staff to each department at 5:00 PM every day to collect the money and then send it to the general accounting office for verification and safekeeping. This has been implemented to this day without any problems. But at about 5:00 PM yesterday afternoon, when the cashier from the general accounting office was collecting money from the departments on the first floor and reached the third floor, he was about to go to the fourth floor to collect money when suddenly four men with handguns rushed up and stopped the cashier. Without asking any questions, they snatched the small leather bag he was carrying to collect the money and fled downstairs. Upon seeing this, the cashier knew that he had been robbed and immediately chased them downstairs, shouting, "Catch the robber!" At this time, the Lao Zha Patrol Station had also received a police report from the company and quickly dispatched detectives to the scene, but the robbers had already escaped. Only one suspect was arrested near the entrance and taken to the patrol station for questioning. After investigation, it was learned that the small leather bag contained more than 18,000 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e203">Shen Linghua's Suicide: Suspicious Points Discovered After Autopsy; Allegedly Killed and Hanged on a Tree; Now Sent to the Institute of Forensic Medicine for Autopsy <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>Shen Jinhua and Shen Linghua, two brothers who were tailors from Yaojiaqiao, Yinxiang District, ran a clothing store. Their business was doing well enough to make ends meet. They had a partner, Dong Linsheng, who was introduced to a widow, Wu Qiaoshi, by Min Wangshi, the wife of Min Zixiang. Wu Qiaoshi had previously been cohabiting with Zhu Along, so there was a dispute in their love affair. On the night of the 30th of this month, Dong was staying at the Shen's house when Zhu suddenly gathered a crowd and went there, severely injuring Dong in all four limbs. Later, Dong Linsheng was sent to the hospital for treatment, and at that time, Shen Linghua suddenly disappeared. It was not until dawn that someone discovered that he had hanged himself on a tree at the end of Huasheng Road. The third section of the fifth district sent Baochang Chen Bingsong to report to the local court that day for an autopsy. Prosecutor Xiao, along with the examiner and bailiff, arrived at the scene to conduct the autopsy. They examined the body naked, front and back, and found no other injuries. The rope marks on the neck were also a symptom of a broken cheekbone, confirming that he had died by suicide. According to Baochang's report, it was also suicide. Judging from the circumstances, it was feared that the deceased had committed suicide out of fear or perhaps had unspeakable secrets. Therefore, he ordered the family to collect the body. However, in the days following the incident, newspapers reported that after Zhu Along injured Dong Linsheng, Shen Linghua was chased out and killed, and then it was faked as a hanging to cover up the murder. At the same time, the deceased's wife, Shen Chenshi, went to the court to file a complaint, stating the above. The prosecutor summoned her and told her to provide more details. If there were any knife or axe wounds, how could there be no bloodstains to hide? However, the woman claimed that there were two knife wounds on her feet, and that she was strangled to death and then hung on the tree, and requested a re-examination. The officer believed that for the sake of caution, he ordered the police to send the coffin to the Forensic Research Institute in Zhenru yesterday for an autopsy. This is indeed a strange matter.</p>

<p>Regarding the case of Japanese women smuggling precious metals, according to the Japanese-language Mainichi Shimbun, since the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department's investigation, the truth has been revealed in the Kansai region. The smuggling methods and other relationships are gradually becoming clear. The head of the smuggling group, Kakutani Eizo, who was arrested in Osaka on November 22, has a branch office at No. 38-93, Yifengli C, Wusong Road, Shanghai. On the one hand, he opened a jewelry store headquarters at No. 32 Unagitanicho, Namba Ward, Osaka. However, he spent about one-third of each month living in Shanghai and secretly traveled between Osaka and Shanghai in first-class cabins. Because customs officers are more lenient in searching first-class passengers, and they sewed the jewels in bags, which were not easy to detect, they have smuggled a huge amount of money, reaching hundreds of thousands of yuan. Currently, there is only a 21-year-old shop assistant and a 42-year-old woman claiming to be a maid in Kakutani's branch office on Wusong Road, and the lights are turned off all night, making it quiet and silent.</p>

<p>At 3:55 PM yesterday, a man suddenly arrived at the Asia Ding Kee Motor Company at 105 Avenue Foch in the French Concession. He was dressed in a dark-colored silk and cotton gown, wearing a small melon-shaped cap, and carrying an umbrella. Speaking with a local accent and appearing like a farmer, he claimed to be surnamed Hong from No. 29 Rue Massenet, and needed to hire a car to the Baiqiao area near Minhang. They agreed on a rate of three dollars per hour, with tips extra. Wang Zhongqing, the company's accountant, immediately ordered chauffeur Xie Aojin, a native of Changzhou, to drive Car No. 12192 (City No. 4140) directly to Minhang. However, when the car reached a remote location on the Minzhe Road, a person standing by the roadside gestured to the car. The man who hired the car ordered the driver to stop. The person who had gestured walked quickly to the front of the car, pulled out a pistol, and forced the driver to get out of the car, saying, "Friend, do me a favor." After saying this, the two men forced the driver out of the car. The driver asked what they wanted the car for, and they replied that they were borrowing it to rob opium. At the same time, four more people jumped out from the roadside and got into the car, which sped away. The driver had no choice but to return and report to the police station. He then hired another car and went back to the company to explain what had happened. They immediately reported to the French Concession police and notified various district offices of the Public Security Bureau and various police stations of the Public Concession to be on the lookout for the car. However, as of last night, the car had not been found.</p>

<p>Wang Chengying, a Chinese detective of the Jiading Road Police Station, Detective Wang Jinshou, and Chinese constables No. 99 and No. 2691, were inspecting pedestrians near Tongzhou Road and Dongyouheng Road at around 6:00 PM the day before yesterday when they saw two men from Shaoxing, Liu Tingshao and Qian Zixuan, acting suspiciously. They were stopped, and because they were carrying firearms, they desperately tried to take them out and resist arrest. When a western officer saw this, he fired three shots into the air as a warning, and they raised their hands in surrender. A pistol was found on Liu, containing nine bullets and a horseshoe-shaped shell. A total of twenty-two bullets were found. A Mauser pistol with eight bullets and a package of thirty bullets were seized from Qian. They were taken to the police station and detained. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin stated the facts, saying that the suspects confessed in the police station that the firearms belonged to Wang Minggao, a fugitive from Huangyan, Taizhou. They were told to bring them to Yangshupu to kidnap a child. Wang lived at No. 325 Xinjihang Road. Detectives secretly went to arrest him but failed to find him. They found a photo on the top floor of the building. According to the person who lived in that room, Wang was preparing a ransom note. The horseshoe-shaped shell found on Liu Tingshao could hold fifty bullets, which was a special weapon. The suspect Qian Zixuan had written threatening letters in his hometown with Wang Minggao, demanding a large sum of money from someone. The local county government was urgently looking for them, so they came to Shanghai with Liu Tingshao only a few days ago. He asked for an adjournment for a detailed investigation. The guns, bullets, and Wang Minggao's photo were presented for inspection, and the two defendants admitted the facts. Judge Wu Zehan ordered them to be returned to custody and rescheduled the hearing.</p>

<p>Wu Junjiang, a police officer from the Wujiang County Public Security Bureau and a native of Shanghai, came to Shanghai on official business a few days ago. He had a friend surnamed Yang who lived at No. 4 Dunheli, Zhonghua Road. Wu visited him at 1:00 PM yesterday. Yang invited Wu upstairs to his room to chat. Soon after, Wu said goodbye and left. Just as he was leaving the room, Li Jianying, who claimed to be an inspector from the Municipal Public Security Bureau, arrived and stopped Wu in Yang's room, claiming that he had been ordered to come to inspect for contraband and that no one was allowed to move. While speaking, he first searched Wu's entire body. Wu realized that the man did not look like a public official, so he asked him if he had an official order and an employee ID. The impostor, Li Jianying, was vague in his reply. Wu knew that he was a criminal, so he immediately reported to police officer Fang Jinqiao at the Sixth Post, who arrested Li Jianying, who was posing as an inspector, and took him to the Second Sub-precinct of the First District for questioning.

<p>The weather in Shanghai has been unusually mild since the Beginning of Winter on November 8th. The weather has been clear for days, resulting in a lack of rain in the rural fields.

<h3 id="e220">Dispute Over Chen Ruilin's Estate After His Death <a href="#e220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>The late lawyer Chen Ruilin, a native of Chongming, was 59 years old. He practiced law in Shanghai and resided at No. 10 Yuanchengli, Route Lafayette in the French Concession. He had married three wives in his early years, all of whom died of illness. Chen had one daughter and two sons. The eldest daughter, Chunfang, is 29 years old and unmarried. The eldest son, Shoupeng, is 18 years old, and the second son, Chouchun, is 11 years old. All were born to his former wives and are currently studying at Zhengfeng Middle School. Several years ago, Chen married Gu, a widow from the same village (53 years old), as his second wife. Gu brought a son from her previous marriage, Liu Baoxiang, who was adopted by Chen as his youngest son, renamed Shou Kang, and lived together. In October of this year, Chen pre-celebrated his 60th birthday at the Guandi Temple inside the West Gate. Relatives and friends considered it inauspicious to celebrate a birthday in a temple. On the morning of November 1st, Chen died suddenly of a stroke in his residence just after getting out of bed. He had considerable savings during his lifetime, with farmland in Chongming, Baoshan, and Qidong counties, as well as cash deposited in Jin Cheng, Shanghai, Xinhua banks and Qingkang Money Shop in Shanghai. He also owned property in Zhabei, including leased land and houses, worth nearly 40,000 gold. Therefore, all the estate documents were held by his wife, Gu Zhengfeng. After learning of his brother's death, Chen Qinglin came to Shanghai to handle the funeral arrangements. Concerned that his two young nephews and unmarried niece would be discriminated against or misappropriated by Gu, he convened a family meeting as guardian, ordering Gu to hand over Chen Ruilin's estate for safekeeping and analysis. However, Gu refused to hand over the estate, arguing that as the wife of the deceased, she had the right to inherit and manage the estate and that others should not worry about it. At this point, Chen Qinglin, in his capacity as guardian, and his two nephews hired a lawyer and published a statement in the newspaper, and sent letters to various banks, money shops, and tenants, prohibiting the deposit, receipt, and storage of various funds. On one hand, he appointed lawyer Huang Zengjie as his agent and filed a lawsuit in the Civil Court of the Second Special District Court, requesting a judgment ordering Chen Gu Zhengfeng to hand over the estate documents of Ruilin for safekeeping and analysis. Chen Gu Zhengfeng also hired lawyers Gong Chuyin and Huang Daping as her agents and filed a lawsuit in the Second Special District Court, requesting confirmation of her right to manage Chen Ruilin's estate. The court has issued summons based on the lawsuit and scheduled a hearing. Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, Judge Wu Xiaoke presided over the hearing in the Seventh Civil Court. In the case of Chen Qinglin, Shoupeng, Chouchun, and others suing for an order to Chen Gu Zhengfeng to hand over the estate documents, both parties were represented by lawyers. First, the plaintiff's lawyer stated the intention of the lawsuit. The defendant's lawyer then stated that the defendant had filed a lawsuit to confirm the right to manage the estate and had received a summons for a hearing scheduled for the 8th (tomorrow). However, the two lawsuits had the same subject matter, and he requested that the court merge the two cases for trial. The judge asked the plaintiff's lawyer how much property was involved, and the lawyer replied that it was approximately 30,000 to 40,000 yuan. Because the banks had refused to provide information, the exact amount was unknown. He requested that the court send letters to the banks to inquire. He then submitted a list of assets. After the court reviewed the list, it ruled that the plaintiff's cause of action was not clear, the litigation costs had not been paid in full, and it ordered a rescheduling of the hearing after the amount of the property was determined, and ordered the plaintiff to pay the litigation costs. The plaintiff's lawyer also stated that the two plaintiffs were young and studying, and had no financial ability. If they were required to pay the litigation costs in the future, they would have to apply for legal aid. He made a verbal statement. The judge ruled that they could apply for a review when the time came and adjourned the court.</p>

<h3 id="e235">Ministry Orders the Closure of the Peiping Academy of Art and Its Reorganization as a National Art Academy; Funding Will Still Be Provided by the Academy of Art; After President Xu's Second Resignation, Presidents of Various Departments Express a New Attitude <a href="#e235" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c235" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">235</a></h3>
<p>Peiping Special Dispatch: After the Peiping University issue developed into a stalemate, acting President Xu Songming has expressed a firm negative stance, refusing to discuss educational administration from now on. Today, he submitted his second resignation to the Ministry of Education. Presidents of various departments also expressed a new attitude today (5th). At the same time, the Ministry of Education issued instructions to Peiping, ordering the Peiping-Tianjin Higher Education Funding Management Committee to allocate the Academy of Art's funding for the Art Academy's funding from next year, and allow the Art Academy Preparatory Office to receive the funding from the Management Committee. The details of each aspect are recorded separately as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e236">Attitudes of Various Presidents <a href="#e236" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c236" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">236</a></h3>
<p>The reporter interviewed the presidents of various departments of Peiping University today, and the summarized opinions are as follows: President Xu (Songming) is determined to resign, and he really has his own unavoidable difficulties. The allocation of part of the Academy of Art's funding to Peiping University is not because Peiping University wants to share the Academy of Art's funding, but because the Ministry of Education had this original idea. Initially, the Ministry of Education ordered the closure of the Academy of Art, and the intention of the closure was to help Peiping University. The Ministry of Education's Order No. 8585 stated that "The Academy of Art should be closed immediately, and the funds saved should be stored specifically and transferred to Peiping University's Agricultural, Engineering, Medical, and Business Departments for special equipment." This shows that the Ministry of Education wanted to help Peiping University, which is why this measure was taken. The closure of the Academy of Art and its reorganization as an Art Academy should require separate funding and should not be robbing Peter to pay Paul. Minister Wang (Shijie) hoped that by allocating all of the Academy of Art's funding to the Art Academy, the Art Academy could become the most perfect educational institution. The Art Academy should indeed be perfect, but Peiping University, which also belongs to the Ministry of Education, should also be improved. The Ministry of Education should take overall consideration. The Art Academy has not yet been established, and it already has 10,000 yuan in funding, which can be called extremely preferential. The original funding of the Academy of Art was 10,000 yuan, which was for a university system with a four-year graduation. Now it has been changed to an Art Academy, which is a three-year graduation. Since there are fewer classes, why is 10,000 yuan needed? (2) After the Art Academy is established, it will first recruit first-year students, and the current funding will definitely not require such a large sum of 10,000 yuan. (3) The Art Academy Preparatory Office will be established in January next year and can only enroll students in June. Is 10,000 yuan needed for the Preparatory Office's funding? It is rumored that Minister Wang will not accept the above three opinions, so the predicament of Peiping University cannot be resolved.</p>
<h3 id="e237">Ministry Orders the Funding Management Committee <a href="#e237" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c237" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">237</a></h3>
<p>Case: The National Peiping University Academy of Art has been ordered to close, and the Executive Yuan has approved its reorganization as the National Peiping Art Academy. The Academy's original funding and assets should be fully transferred to the Art Academy for handover. The Ministry has now appointed Yan Zhikai as the director of the Preparatory Office and established the National Peiping Art Academy Preparatory Office. The original funding of 10,000 yuan for the National Peiping University Academy of Art should be fully transferred from the University, starting from January 23, to the National Peiping Art Academy Preparatory Office for monthly receipt from the Committee. In addition to separate instructions, the order should be followed and reported. Minister of Education Wang Shijie. According to Yang Likui, a standing committee member of the Funding Management Committee, after receiving the Ministry of Education's instructions, the Committee has sent separate letters to Peiping University and the Art Academy Preparatory Office today, instructing them to comply with the Ministry's order starting from January 23.</p>
<h3 id="e238">Original Order for the Academy of Art to Be Reorganized into a College <a href="#e238" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c238" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">238</a></h3>
<p>Case: The University of Arts has been ordered to close, and the Executive Yuan has approved its reorganization as the National Peiping Art Academy. The College's original funding and properties should be fully transferred to the Art Academy to accept. The Ministry has now appointed Yan Zhikai as the director of the Preparatory Office and established the National Peiping Art Academy Preparatory Office. In addition to the original Arts College Property Custody Office, which should be closed by this December and transfer all remaining funds and custody of the property, about the original College of Arts funding of 10,000 yuan, should be given entirely out from the University starting from January 23, to the Art Academy Preparatory Office and received directly from the Peiping and Tianjin Higher Education Funding Management Committee. In addition to separate instructions to National Peiping Art Academy Preparatory Office, the Peiping-Tianjin Higher Education Funding Management Committee should comply with the order and report.

<h3 id="e239">Process of Reorganization of the Academy of Art into a College <a href="#e239" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c239" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">239</a></h3>
<p>The College of Art was originally called the Beijing Art School, which opened in April of the seventh year of the Republic of China, dividing it into secondary and higher divisions. In June of the eleventh year, it was renamed the Beijing Art College. In March of the fourteenth year, it was suspended. In the fifteenth year, it reopened and was renamed the Art College. In the seventeenth year, it was renamed the College of Art, National Peiping University, establishing six departments: Chinese Painting, Western Painting, Applied Art, Architecture, Music, and Drama. This was the most prosperous period of the College. Subsequently, opinions among the professors of each department diverged, student factions formed, and Director Xu Beihong was expelled and Secretary Jiang Yaqu was beaten. The Ministry of Education regarded the College of Art as a nest of reactionary elements. Therefore, it instructed Peiping University to close the College of Art. After the efforts of the Peiping University authorities, it was changed to a gradual closure each year. This year, the Minister of Education changed, and Wang Shijie was honored as Minister. Not long after taking office, he immediately ordered the College of Art to be closed, and the slogan of "gradual closure" was announced to be cancelled. For students whose studies were not yet complete, the Ministry of Education ordered the College of Art to issue diplomas for two or three-year specialized courses. After the mediation of Xu Songming, the acting President of Peiping University, it was finally agreed to allow some students, such as Ms. Shi Xiaoyun, to transfer to other schools, and the College of Art was ordered to be closed immediately, clearing the arrears of teachers and staff. Recently, the Ministry of Education, because the closure of the College of Art was completed, requested the Executive Yuan to reorganize the College of Art into the National Peiping Art Academy, first establishing a preparatory office and appointing Yan Zhikai as the director. This is the process of reorganizing the College of Art into a College. As for the detailed measures for the reorganization, they have not yet been announced.</p>
<h3 id="e240">Professors Express Their Attitudes <a href="#e240" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c240" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">240</a></h3>
<p>According to Professor Liu, there are ways to solve the funding problems of Peiping University. During Zhu Jiahua's tenure as Minister of Education, he originally intended to close the College of Art. After the closure, all of the College's funding would be allocated to Peiping University to supplement the Agricultural, Engineering, and Medical Colleges. After the efforts of Shen Yinmo, the former President of Peiping University, and Yang Zhongzi, the former Director of the College of Art, Zhu agreed to a gradual closure. After the closure, it would be reorganized into a specialized school, with part of the funding subsidizing the Agricultural, Engineering, and Medical Colleges, and the remaining part used for the Art College. This year, Wang Shijie became the Minister of Education and suddenly issued an order to rectify Peiping University during the summer vacation, stating that the College of Art had long been ordered to close and should be closed this year. In fact, the Ministry of Education had not previously ordered it to be closed, only ordered a gradual closure. Peiping University did comply with the Ministry's order to close and made arrangements for students of the Academy to transfer. This situation gradually subsided. Now that the College of Art is about to be completed, according to the Ministry of Education's orders over the years, after the College of Art is closed, it should be reorganized into a Specialized Academy, and a part of the funding should be transferred to Peiping University's Agricultural, Commercial, and Medical departments for equipment. The remaining funds should be allocated to the Art Specialized Academy. However, Minister Wang changed his policy and allocated all of the College of Art's funding to the Art Specialized Academy. Peiping University's Agricultural, Commercial, and Medical departments cannot increase their funding by a single cent. Only next year, when the Auditing Department audits the funding, will it try to help Peiping University under the name of rescue, but in fact, it is equivalent to issuing an empty check that cannot be cashed, which is useless. The funding for the College of Art was originally 10,000 yuan per month, of which 300 yuan subsidized the High School attached to Peiping University, and 150 yuan to the Peiping University President's office, totaling 450 yuan. The College of Art actually received 9,550 yuan per month. Now that all of the College of Art's funding has been allocated to the Art Specialized Academy, the funding for the Art Specialized Academy is quite sufficient. On the Peiping University side, it is even more difficult to break the deadlock. President Xu (Songming)'s resignation is detrimental to the future of Peiping University, and the four colleges of Agriculture, Engineering, Medicine, and Commerce cannot be developed at present. The College of Arts and Law may also have problems in the future. As for whether the High School will exist after the summer vacation next year, it cannot be predicted at this moment. This is because the Ministry of Education originally ordered the High School to be closed this year, but Xu Songming, the acting President of Peiping University, argued for its retention at the risk of his job. The Ministry of Education agreed to change it to next year. This issue is still pending. (5th Jin)</p>

<p>The preliminary issue for the Ministry of Education's preparation for the establishment of the National Institute of Physical Education is funding. Regular expenses will only be needed after the school opens, which is not an urgent need. The current urgent need is start-up funding, at least to build a gymnasium. The construction cost of the gymnasium at Central University is over 100,000, and labor costs are now higher than before. Adding staff and student dormitories to this item will cost more than 100,000. How will this cost be raised? It is said that the relevant department of the Ministry of Education and the physical education supervisor will discuss with the minister within days. After the start-up funding is available, the preparatory work will be carried out so that the school can open after the summer vacation next year. In addition, the physical education supervisor's draft of physical education materials for junior high school students is expected to be completed before the spring cold, and the materials for high school students can be finalized before the summer vacation.</p>

<p>Five groups of Xiqing women's basketball games were played last night. It is not surprising that Liangjiang won over the Telephone Company, as the strength difference is too great. The defeat of Southeast B is a pity. The competition between the Red Team and the Yellow Team was very intense, but the Southeast A team defeated the Junior Team easily. One of the closest scores was in the battle between Mailing and the Blue Team. The Blue Team was very smooth at half time. Until the second half, Mailing came from behind and won the victory. The results of the five groups are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e264">Liangjiang Wins Big Over the Telephone Company <a href="#e264" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c264" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">264</a></h3>
<p>Liangjiang has been trained for a long time, and its offense and defense have been well-regulated. In the sound of the battle whistle, it has been advancing steadily. Yang, Pan, and Chen have been making shots accurately. In the blink of an eye, they have already taken an eleven-point lead. Looking back at the Telephone Company, it is still wandering back and forth, accomplishing nothing. Until the end of the first quarter, center Jones scored two consecutive goals to decorate it. The momentum of the first quarter was 15 to 4. The situation in the second quarter remained the same, with a score of 11 to 1. In the third quarter, Liangjiang doubled its progress, making the Telephone Company stand by and wait for death, resulting in a score of 39 to 7. In the last quarter, Liangjiang seemed to have the victory in hand and did not want to ask for too much, resulting in a score of 48 to 9.</p>

<p>Southeast B's defeat to the Green Team was due to the fact that its skills were slightly inferior, and the disparity in height was its fatal injury. In the first quarter, Southeast B could not develop at all and was trapped in a dilemma, with a difference of 14 points, making it difficult to recover later. The first quarter was 14 to 0. In the second quarter, Southeast B was stern and good at both offense and defense, forming a confrontational situation. In the third game, the Green Team was forced and made a treaty under the city, and Southeast B had already occupied a priority position. The result of that quarter was 9 to 2, and Southeast B reversed the victory. In the fourth quarter, Southeast B was more energetic and gradually caught up. Unfortunately, at the end, it was repeatedly thrown in by the enemy and lost by 27 to 42.</p>

<p>The Red Team continued for two quarters, the first quarter was very close, taking the lead with 5 to 4. The second quarter was very smooth, doing whatever they wanted, leading the first half with 26. In the third quarter, the situation suddenly changed, the Yellow Team controlled everything and scored 12 points, while the Red Team only got 2 points, for a total of 18 to 22. The Yellow Team was only 4 points behind. In the fourth quarter, the Yellow Team's offensive was still strong, and they scored a goal at the beginning, giving them great hope. Who knew that in the last few minutes, the Red Team returned to its original form and surpassed again. As a result, the Red Team won 28 to 20.</p>
<h3 id="e267">Southeast A Overwhelms the Junior Team <a href="#e267" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c267" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">267</a></h3>
<p>At the sound of the battle whistle, the Junior Team was penalized, and Liao Zhuyuan scored a goal, taking the lead by one point. The Junior Team continued to score a goal, and Southeast also returned a goal, and then led by 6 to 5. At that time, Southeast A relied on Liao Zhuyuan's cleverness and agility, Ren Shu's excellent throwing, Liu Wenhua's adequate response, and the thorough defense of the interior, and scored eight consecutive points, taking the lead with 14 to 5. In the second quarter, the Junior Team paid more attention to defense, and although Southeast A was strong, it was not easy to score. The Junior Team's shooting skills were not good, and there were frequent misses. In the first half, Southeast A had a strong momentum with 20 to 7. In the third quarter, Liao Zhuyuan opened the scoring again, scoring a goal, followed by Liu Wenhua, and Ren Shu scored again, and the victory was decided. After that, it formed a landslide, and the Junior Team was already in an irreversible situation, reluctantly coping. The third quarter was 14 to 2, and Southeast A took the lead again. At the beginning of the fourth quarter, Chen Yuru replaced Liu Wenhua, and the forwards became more active, and Ren Shu scored three consecutive goals. The Junior Team made quick shots and was lively, but the throwing was not sure at all. At one point, they even threw seven or eight times, all out of the basket. Although they gained something later, it was of no avail, but it was much more impressive than the previous three quarters. As a result, Southeast A won 45 to 18.</p>

<p>Result 56 to 29</p>
<p>The Mul basketball team has been practicing diligently recently and has repeatedly arranged friendly matches to learn from each other. The other night, they responded to the invitation of the Nanyang team, which has youth and is all black, to fight in the Chinese basketball room. Although Nanyang has strong players such as Lu Dazhen, Jia Youliang, and Zhou Zhi, they were greatly defeated due to a lack of contact. Looking back at the Mul players, the forwards and guards worked together as one. Yao Benyi was in charge of shooting, and Captain Song Qihou guarded the gate, and every time he went out, he would return with success. This made the Nanyang forwards lose their shooting opportunities. As a result, Mul won 56 to 29.</p>

<h3 id="e277">Shameless Behavior <a href="#e277" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c277" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">277</a></h3>
<p>— Natural</p>
<p>A London dispatch dated the 30th of last month reported that Japan's unfair competition methods have provoked vehement attacks in the British House of Commons. A high-ranking official of the Board of Trade, Mr. Runciman, delivered a speech in the House, expressing great indignation at Japanese goods being passed off as British goods and using British trademarks. Mr. Runciman stated that governments of all countries should actively take measures to suppress such shameless behavior. Therefore, the British government, after obtaining concrete evidence, should lodge a formal protest with the Japanese government without regard for diplomatic niceties.</p>
<p>When our countrymen read this news item, what thoughts arise if they close their eyes and reflect? The Japanese have been engaging in shameless behavior towards our country for more than just a day. They clearly come from Japan but are labeled as made in Germany, the United States, or other countries. They are clearly Japanese goods but falsely claim to be domestic products. While discerning people can easily see through such tricks, many of our countrymen are regrettably deceived. This counterfeit branding alone deprives our domestic goods of considerable sales each year. However, this reporter believes that we should not blame others for such shameless behavior but first blame ourselves. It is only because there are shameless countrymen that the Japanese dare to engage in such shameless tricks. In the entire country, there are many people who act as accomplices to tigers, blinded by greed. To call them shameless countrymen is a mild term. Does the reader doubt my words? They clearly purchase Japanese yarn but claim it is domestic. They clearly purchase Japanese cloth but falsely claim they wove it themselves. They use their skills of deception to secretly alter appearances in the dark of night. People's lack of conscience has reached such a point. Yet, they still call themselves merchants in society and remain nonchalant. They use domestic brand names to sell Japanese goods and remain nonchalant. They install a few machines to put on a show and secretly smuggle in goods, remaining nonchalant. People say that the most degenerate people in the country are those in Shanghai. This is because the people of Shanghai are too focused on profit, disregarding everything else. Mr. Hu'e Sheng said, "People today have increasingly thick skin, and their masks cannot be torn off unless they are directly punished in person." These words keenly capture the psychology of Shanghai society. As a reporter, I know that speaking these words will offend people, but driven by my conscience, I must speak them. I hope that readers will:</p>
<p>(1) From now on, pay attention to this shameless behavior and no longer be deceived by it.</p>
<p>(2) From now on, abandon sentimentality. If any of your relatives or friends engage in this shameless behavior, you should sincerely advise and scold them face-to-face. If they refuse to listen to your scolding, sever ties with them and reject them together. Expel them to the four barbarian lands, not associating with them in China. I would also like to offer a final piece of sincere advice to those who still want to engage in selling inferior goods: There are many occupations in the world, and many businesses can be operated for profit. Why sacrifice your conscience, defy the world's condemnation, and engage in this risky, opportunistic behavior that harms others and damages the country? Lay down the butcher knife and become a Buddha on the spot. In human society, life is at most a hundred years. It is better to do more things that you can be proud of, becoming an upright and honest person.</p>
<p>Discussion on National Goods</p>
<h3 id="e278">After Reading "How Should We Promote National Goods in the Countryside?" <a href="#e278" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c278" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">278</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Mengzhao</p>
<p>After reading Mr. Huang Yingdai's article "How Should We Promote National Goods in the Countryside" in this publication, I feel that what Mr. Huang said is indeed to the point, but I have some supplementary opinions "regarding how to promote national goods in the countryside," which I write below.</p>
<p>This summer, I happened to travel to Jiaoshan Township in Wuxi because of something. Those so-called sacred farmers and farm women there mostly admire new Shanghai decorations and new patterns, constantly praising them in their mouths. There is a wealthy household in the township that has a radio and a phonograph. After finishing their work in the fields, they run to listen to it with great joy, gathering a large crowd. When they hear a very beautiful tune, they also hum along. Therefore, it is not necessary to preach in the countryside, because to preach effectively in the field, one must become a farmer and join their ranks to promote national goods. Otherwise, lecturing in a serious and pretentious manner will definitely not be effective. We may as well use the all-powerful radio to instill national goods news and songs into their minds. It is also easy for rural cooperatives to set up one. Although there is no substitute national product for the radio yet, it is more worthwhile to prevent the dumping of a large number of Western goods and the alarming outflow of interests with one radio. The Japanese, who have the most solid patriotism, the government still announced that there are dozens of non-national products that they cannot create themselves and have to use. Second: Celebrities who promote national products should discuss with the domestic film company authorities to shoot more "plays that show the pain of foreign goods oppression and the joy of people using national goods to save the country." They should come to the inland countryside to screen them. In the countryside without electricity, they should cooperate with vigilant paintings to issue a kind of daily national goods voucher. If the villagers want money, they can take money; if they want to buy some daily necessities, they can take some "daily national goods vouchers." If we work hard to promote in this way and implement it in a planned way, I believe that national goods will definitely sweep away imported goods in the countryside, and everyone will happily use national goods! What do you readers think?</p>
<h3 id="e279">The National Goods Movement and Rural Relief <a href="#e279" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c279" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">279</a></h3>
<p>— Fang Cuinong</p>
<p>- Dedicated to those who promote national goods and serve rural businesses -</p>
<p>We all know that China is based on the countryside. Undoubtedly, the promotion of national goods should also focus on the vast countryside. Moreover, we all know that the biggest reason for the bankruptcy of the rural economy is the invasion of foreign economies, and isn't economic invasion caused by the filling of the market with foreign goods; so that farmers also abandon local goods to buy foreign goods?</p>
<p>As long as we open our eyes, we can see everywhere in the countryside that farmers also use foreign goods, such as kerosene and cigarettes that occupy most of the small shops and stalls... Rural women also mostly wear foreign goods such as printed foreign yarn and flannel... In short, the countryside has obviously gone bankrupt now, but they still wear foreign cloth, use foreign goods, and even eat foreign rice... This kind of bleak phenomenon should not have happened after the National Goods Year of 1933 - and it should not be discovered again under the revival of the countryside - I think that the current promotion of national goods to relieve the countryside should be carried out in two ways.</p>
<p>The first is to promote the use of national goods by farmers; because rural people lack knowledge, have no national concept, and are selfish and greedy for immediate small profits; so they are easily fooled by merchants to purchase foreign goods. In addition, there is a lack of opportunities to buy national goods in the countryside. - So promoting national goods is also very important, but whether in the countryside or the city, advertising and promotion are very ineffective. I think it is necessary to promote it in the countryside</p>
<h3 id="e280">How Exactly Is China Contributing as One of Twenty-Seven Nations? <a href="#e280" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c280" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">280</a></h3>
<p>— Yang Mang</p>
<p>It's a pity that the empty show of resistance is gaining momentum, and Japanese goods are flooding in like a tide. According to a survey by the Trade Bureau of the Japanese Ministry of Commerce and Industry on November 30, the prevention of imports of Japanese goods by various countries around the world is now becoming more intense, reaching as many as twenty-seven countries. The preventive measures are all policies such as raising tariffs, import permits, exchange controls, and dumping taxes. From this point of view, there are actually twenty-seven countries in the world that are resisting Japanese goods, and poor China actually accounts for one of the twenty-seven countries. However, in fact, China's resistance to Japanese goods is probably just writing a few articles, holding a few meetings, and drafting a few regulations, and then it's over. Has there ever been a real preparation, a whole plan, and a sincere and determined effort to work quickly, practically, and hard? After reading this news, the reporter felt really ashamed and sad. This year was wasted as a National Goods Year, but unexpectedly created an opportunity for Japanese goods to sell well. Do readers also know that Japanese goods are everywhere in North China? Do they also know that Japanese goods are smuggled everywhere in the Shanghai market? Do they also know that Japanese goods are active everywhere in the ports along the Yangtze River? Others have built solid defenses, marched swiftly, and have achieved results in resisting Japanese goods. We are putting on an empty show, with only outward appearances. As a result, the more we advocate resistance, the more rampant Japanese goods become. This newspaper published on the 5th that the International Trade Bureau released the prices of imported cosmetics and perfumes from various countries from January to October this year, reaching 1,398,664 yuan. In addition to the United States, France, and Britain, Japan is the most. As the Japanese Daily reported, Japan shipped more than 21,000 pieces of fresh and salted Japanese fish from Qingdao and Dalian last week, with a total value of more than 500,000 yuan. May I ask, is this resisting Japanese goods? Or is it promoting the sale of Japanese goods? The phenomenon is like this, which is lamentable. If European countries feel that Japanese goods are being dumped, they either loudly call for attention or actively defend against and restrict them. Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, witnessing the monopoly of the Asian market by Japanese cotton textiles and the invasion of Italy by Far Eastern rayon, has long been in contact with Germany and Russia to find ways to resist. Looking at our country, government officials are busy with civil wars, and social industries and commerce are too busy to save themselves. As a result, the Japanese lure from the outside, and good merchants collude from the inside, and such a large China has become a large market for Japanese goods to be active. Every time I think about it, I feel heartbroken. Recently, Mr. Zhang Gongquan, after inspecting the Northwest, talked about the localism of Shanxi people, which is even more than patriotism. The only purpose of Shanxi people buying goods is to use self-sufficient Shanxi goods. If it is not enough, they use Chinese goods. If it is not enough, they use imported goods. Everything must be subject to the Economic Control Bureau. Even with cigarettes, the issuance of licenses is very strict. Merchants who have licenses are only allowed to sell Shanxi cigarettes. Shanghai cigarettes and British and American cigarettes are not easy to obtain. The strictness of the defenses can be seen. In my opinion, although the method of Shanxi people is limited to regional views, their courage to resist foreign goods is admirable. Secondly, the industrial control in Guangxi Province adheres to the policy that imports must not exceed exports, and its courage is also commendable. If Chinese people can all be like this, and all places can be like this, then there is no need to talk about resisting Japanese goods, and Japanese goods will have no way to enter. Otherwise, being listed as one of the twenty-seven countries, and having an empty name for resisting Japanese goods, the future of the national goods industry will be even more unbearable to hear.</p>
<p>In order to promote national goods, the following points should be noted:</p>
<p>1. There should be young men and women who "lead by example" to guide farmers to happily use national goods.</p>
<p>2. Use a roving national goods exhibition to collect various national goods needed by farmers and exhibit them in the countryside after the autumn harvest.</p>
<p>3. Show slide shows and movies about national goods... to arouse interest in buying national goods.</p>
<p>4. Set up a small-scale national goods specimen exhibition room in the local agricultural education center, primary school, or improvement association to enable farmers to recognize national goods.</p>
<p>5. Manufacturers should negotiate with local cooperatives to wholesale or lend to farmers.</p>
<p>6. Wholesale to peddlers so that they can sell in the countryside.</p>
<p>The second is to use the original production in the countryside to supplement the lack of national goods. We know that in the past, the countryside has always been that men farmed and women weaved, without seeking external forces. They wore native cloth, used native goods, lit lamps with rapeseed oil and vegetable oil, made clothes with self-woven native cloth, and smoked self-grown native tobacco... Therefore, in addition to promoting national goods, we should use the original production to improve it to remedy the lack of national goods and economic losses. We should also cooperate with manufacturers to use the low wages of rural women to do handicrafts (such as pasting matchboxes), and promote the cultivation of pyrethrum, mint, daylilies, cotton... to subsidize the raw materials for manufacturing national goods and increase the income from rural production. It will also be of great benefit to promoting national goods to relieve the countryside.</p>
<p>In short, in China, where the rural economy has gone bankrupt and the market is filled with foreign goods, to promote national goods. I think the above two points are indeed things that cannot be ignored; moreover, national goods and the countryside have a close relationship. It can be said that national goods completely rely on the countryside, whether it is its raw materials or sales channels, the countryside must be the main base. - In the past, the reason why national goods could not be developed was also largely related to the fact that the movement was focused only on cities! From now on, promoting national goods and relieving the countryside should work together to plan. In other words: manufacturers and rural service personnel should be in close contact: so that the supply of raw materials for national goods and the sales channels of products can be adjusted!</p>
<p>Finally! I hope that comrades who promote national goods and relieve the countryside will pay attention to it; and give me some correction -</p>
<p>Discussion on National Goods</p>
<h3 id="e281">Promoting National Goods Should Start with Oneself <a href="#e281" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c281" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">281</a></h3>
<p>— Ling Bai</p>
<p>It seems a bit excessive, but I dare to state responsibly that this is absolutely true.</p>
<p>This place is the highest authority for national administration and academic research. Therefore, the middle and senior staff here are all first-class scholars and patriots in the country. Even general assistants and trainees, etc., are all gilded with a layer of gold—Bachelor’s degrees.</p>
<p>The matters we research are said to be: (1) how to develop the national economy, (2) how to revive the countryside, (3) how to increase the production of national goods, (4) how to resist the import of foreign goods, and (5) how to enrich the people's strength, (6) how to improve the people's livelihood... and other issues of "national economy and people's livelihood."</p>
<p>However, unfortunately! Our rural people have long been working hard, digging up their labor and squeezing dry their sweat and blood. Even more unfortunately, what they get in return for their hard work throughout the year is clothes that cannot cover their bodies and food that cannot fill their stomachs. Even the lowest standard of living is difficult to maintain. Without sufficient production funds and without adequate living materials, they eat rural brown rice, wear rural native cloth, and use rural handicraft products. They have no better purchasing power or consumption power. How can they increase production? They have long been eating national goods and using national goods.</p>
<p>Only citizens' meetings are the target of our national goods movement.</p>
<p>But in this highest authority for national administration and academic research, many young scholars and patriots serve in national public institutions, earn taxes from the blood and sweat of the people, research the national economy and people's livelihood, and talk and write about saving the country, but how contradictory are the facts! They! Eighty-eight percent of them wear brand-new and smart foreign-made suits, live in tall foreign buildings of cement and steel, eat coffee, bread, whiskey, and brandy, and use Western-style furniture and decorations. They occupy the upper layer of society, have great purchasing power and consumption power, but they have forgotten that "everyone is responsible for the rise and fall of the country"!</p>
<p>Is there anything surprising about this? Aren't all the facts presented in our society so common and prevalent? Is there anything special about this place! But to talk about saving the country, to talk about reviving the countryside, and to develop the national economy, we must first promote national goods and engage in the national goods movement. This is the duty of every compatriot and also the responsibility of every compatriot.</p>
<p>- Alas! The national crisis is pressing, I hope our compatriots will be more vigilant! Don't forget that "promoting national goods should start with oneself." - This is our only creed.</p>
<h3 id="e282">Merchants Promoting National Goods in the Countryside <a href="#e282" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c282" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">282</a></h3>
<p>— Que Baling</p>
<p>In the last two issues of this publication, there were articles about "promoting national goods in the countryside," which made me have endless feelings.</p>
<p>What I mean by feelings is not that national goods should not be promoted in the countryside. Strictly speaking, the enemy of national goods is not in the countryside, but in the cities, not in the hard-working farmers, but in the general intellectual class who call themselves modern. This is not an exaggeration, but there are facts to prove it.</p>
<p>My relative, Mr. X (farmer), when his children (I won't mention their names) were studying in the countryside, all their clothes were completely native cloth. When they grew up and went to study in the city, all their clothes and supplies hated native goods and admired foreign goods. Every year the cost is quite high. Mr. X occasionally mentioned this, and there must be endless emotions in it.</p>
<p>The above is not a deliberate fabrication, but an absolutely true fact. The reason why I want to present it in this publication is to prove that the focus of promoting national goods is 30% in the countryside and 70% still in the prosperous cities and the intellectual class.</p>
<p>Therefore, I believe that while promoting national goods, the countryside should not be abandoned, but the city should not be taken lightly. It should be known that those who wear foreign goods and use foreign objects are generally modern people, and there are few simple rural people. I think everyone will agree with this.</p>
<p>In summary, to sum it up in one sentence, the promotion of national goods requires the concerted efforts of the whole country, both urban and rural, A part of the promotion and the efforts of one place still do not have much effect.</p>

<p>— Natural</p>
<p>Thank you to China's many wives, grandmothers, and misses, who, during this National Goods Year, consumed 1,398,664 yuan worth of foreign cosmetics, perfumes, and powders from January to October. This expense is truly considerable. Unfortunately, rural women do not have the fortune to contribute. I dare say that those who contribute are all the wives, grandmothers, and misses in the city. You want to look good, you want to be beautiful, you want to win people's favor, so you don't buy Chinese goods and go to buy foreign goods, wasting this huge sum of money. Thank you for squandering your husband's hard-earned money in vain. As a result, you have created many more guns, cannons, airplanes, and warships for others. Alas, China's wives, grandmothers, and misses, the wives, grandmothers, and misses in the city. The wives, grandmothers, and misses who have received higher education.</p>
<p>Damned Westernized Friends</p>
<p>When smoking, you have to smoke foreign cigarettes, when drinking, you have to drink foreign wine, and when dressing, you have to wear foreign wool and foreign silk. Your hair is also curled, but unfortunately, there is no way to dye your eyes green. Alas, damned Westernized friends, why do you call yourselves Chinese? You might as well naturalize directly into a foreign country and be a complete foreign slave. Anyway, there are many Chinese people, and you are not few unfilial elements who are obsessed with Westernization.</p>

<h3 id="e284">The Various Aspects of Housewives Promoting National Goods <a href="#e284" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c284" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">284</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Sisi</p>
<p>The National Goods Exhibition organized by the Young Women's Christian Association is about to open. As Mr. Yang An said, whether the promotion of national goods is successful or not depends on the hands of the ladies and wives. The reason why the past national goods movement failed was because the promoters did not pay attention to the ladies and wives. Now, the Young Women's Christian Association, with the grandmothers and wives as the backbone, is automatically rising up to hold a national goods exhibition, which is such a gratifying thing. The goods they are exhibiting are aimed at families, and they are divided into three grades according to the economic situation of general families, which is very novel and meets the needs of reality. Housewives who have never used national goods or do not know what national goods are, if they visit, will definitely have a clear understanding of national goods. They must not forget after the visit, and they should use national goods forever from now on. But, how should housewives promote national goods? Although the exhibition has already displayed many national goods of different categories, which can be used as a reference for the ladies and wives, I think there are still a few points that are also worth paying attention to by the ladies and wives.</p>
<p>Restraining Husbands</p>
<p>No one can deny that the most powerful force in restraining men is their wives. Men often act blindly based on their own will, and it is difficult for others to persuade him to change his mind. Only a beloved wife can find a way to make him change his mind. Many men are enthusiastic about imported goods. Those who are his wives should exert her mission, work hard to restrain him and persuade him, and not allow him to buy a single foreign product. It is best to throw a tantrum at him when he buys foreign goods and returns, and give him the "cold shoulder." As a result of this non-cooperation, he will not buy those "damn" imported goods again next time. Mr. Yang An said: If the husband buys foreign goods, the wife can implement a strike or file for divorce. This is the best method.</p>
<p>Advising Children</p>
<p>Housewives have more opportunities to contact their children, and they have the most influence on them. If housewives use national goods, the children will naturally hate foreign goods after being impressed for a long time. Otherwise, innocent children will also like to use foreign goods, which will have an infinite impact on the future of national goods. Therefore, a virtuous mother must often advise her children on the meaning of promoting national goods, so that a concept of national goods remains in their innocent souls: at the same time, she must of course use national goods for the goods she consumes, and set an example.</p>
<p>Restraining Servants</p>
<p>Servants have very little knowledge and simple minds. They simply do not know what it means to love the country and use national goods. When the master orders them to buy things, they often buy foreign goods. Therefore, housewives should often restrain them and guide them to buy national goods.</p>
<p>Recognizing National Goods</p>
<p>There is also one point that is very important, and that is that housewives should pay more attention to recognizing national goods. Because now unscrupulous merchants know that it is difficult to sell enemy goods, they often change the appearance of foreign goods and pretend to be national goods. The techniques they use are clever and powerful. Housewives who are enthusiastic about national goods may accidentally buy these things, which would be too disappointing for their sincerity in promoting and loving the country. Therefore, housewives must carefully remember the trademarks, brands, and factory names of national goods products in order to avoid being deceived by unscrupulous merchants.</p>

<h3 id="e285">Where to Start Promoting National Goods <a href="#e285" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c285" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">285</a></h3>
<p>— He Bi</p>
<p>Promoting national goods, "start with children": This is what many people are saying, and many people are also agreeing with it; but how should we do it? The answer is this, saying, we should ask parents to pay attention and not give children anything other than national goods, and parents themselves should never use foreign goods, setting an example so that children have a mentality of loving national goods and hating enemy goods. Then this responsibility is entirely on the parents, and the burden of promoting national goods rests on the parents first.</p>
<p>Another saying is that to promote national goods "start with elementary school teachers", because one elementary school teacher is in contact with many children, and is also a standard for children. Many, many children follow their teachers in using national goods, so the application of national goods is considerable! These points are indeed the great way to promote national goods.</p>
<p>However, on the other hand, we must also hope for creation, because we ask national goods to replace foreign goods completely, so that everything that everyone's eyes come into contact with is national goods, then there is no need to check, all goods are domestic products, it is easy to adopt, and the elimination of national goods is also good. - Because sometimes there is still the suffering of buying the wrong thing? At present, the results of compatriots using national goods are much higher than before. If you don't believe it, you only need to go to the national goods market on Nanjing Road to prove it. So I say that to promote national goods "start with creating national goods". In addition, "national goods are on sale" is also an excellent method.</p>
<p>From what has been said above, as long as national goods can be equal to foreign goods, and national goods are not more expensive than foreign goods, then soon everyone will use national goods, and national goods will be consumed by the people. This year's National Goods Year will also be worthy of its name.</p>
<p>Finally, I calculated that there is only a whole month left in the National Goods Year. After January, it will be the first National Goods Year, but I hope that national goods manufacturers will continue to create and continue to promote sales.</p>

<h3 id="e286">On the Art of Advertising Domestic Goods <a href="#e286" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c286" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">286</a></h3>
<p>— Quan Jia</p>
<p>To revitalize domestic goods, advertising is indeed a necessary tool. However, in the initial stages of promoting domestic goods, how should advertising be made more practical? Now, I offer several suggestions for the domestic goods industry.</p>
<p>(1) It is often seen that during a major sale at domestic goods companies, advertising papers are plastered all over the walls. This actually makes people pay less attention. Moreover, it is a waste of paper and does not help. I suggest sticking to designated advertising columns, or using the remaining money to buy domestic goods and offer them as prizes for essay contests, awarding prizes to the best entries. Wouldn't that kill two birds with one stone?</p>
<p>(2) Regarding advertisements for domestic goods companies, I believe it's better to explain their true strengths and weaknesses and compare them with foreign goods, rather than simply saying how good they are, or even saying they are no different from foreign goods. The former is nothing more than deception, while the latter increases genuine sympathy from the Chinese people.</p>
<p>(3) In addition, it is best to focus advertising slightly more on the inland areas, because the tentacles of imperialism have reached into the inland, and what the people see and hear is nothing more than foreign propaganda. Therefore, for the majority of the people to know about domestic goods, this is the most important condition. The establishment of domestic goods companies in various regions by the China Production and Sales Cooperation Association is for this purpose.</p>
<p>Finally, the advertising techniques for our domestic goods business urgently need to be economical, effective, and rational. Otherwise, it is better to save the wasted money and focus on the quality of the products!</p>
<h3 id="e287">A Contribution to the Goods Manager of a Domestic Goods Factory <a href="#e287" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c287" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">287</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Nangong</p>
<p>In this year of promoting domestic goods, the mission of a domestic goods factory is not only to supply the commodities needed domestically, but also to be the vanguard in resisting foreign goods. Therefore, on the one hand, it is necessary to encourage the Chinese people to use domestic goods, and on the other hand, to strive for improvements in products and reductions in prices. However, in many factories at present, they temporarily seek profit while neglecting technological advancement, focusing on business development with a complacent mentality, or even engaging in cutthroat competition among themselves. I fear that before foreign goods can be completely resisted, the factories themselves will be shaken, leading to collapse, and the entire domestic goods business will be hindered as a result. The danger in the future is truly unimaginable!</p>
<p>Indeed, the main purpose of a factory is to develop its business, but if there are no good results in manufacturing, even if it is vigorously promoted and sells well for a time, failure is inevitable. Therefore, the quality of the products is also the key to future success or failure. This is an undeniable fact.</p>
<p>Since superior products are paramount, it is also necessary to manage goods perfectly. If a goods manager does not have a keen mind and accurate calculations, then errors in receiving and dispatching are unavoidable. For example, if a customer orders goods to be shipped to another location, and the manager, due to a moment's negligence, misallocates colors or quantities, and this is only discovered when the goods arrive at the other location, then the customer will sacrifice shipping costs and delay their business, and the factory's reputation will be damaged, leading to numerous disputes. The impact on the factory's reputation and business may be no less than the issue of product quality!</p>
<p>Therefore, the precision and thoroughness of a factory's goods manager in their duties is of great help to the progress of the business. In addition to the cleanliness of the goods storage, the accuracy of receiving and dispatching inspections, the speed of distribution and adjustment, and the solidity of packaging and assembly, they must also have a patient personality, an agile mind, and a hardworking spirit. This is the knowledge that every goods manager of a domestic goods factory should have!</p>
<h3 id="e288">Visit Notes: Visit to the China Nail Manufacturing Company <a href="#e288" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c288" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">288</a></h3>
<p>— Ji Yin Zhao</p>
<p>It is shameful to say that we in our country cannot even produce enough nails for our own needs, and must rely on imports, with large sums of money flowing abroad. This is such a shameful thing—last year's customs report: excluding those manufactured in factories set up in our country by foreigners, imports of round nails—commonly known as foreign nails—reached as many as 240,000 barrels (each barrel containing 100 pounds). Fellow countrymen, pay attention! Don't underestimate them just because a copper coin can buy several nails.</p>
<p>The China Nail Manufacturing Company was founded in November of the 20th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1931], and its rapid progress is unmatched by ordinary factories. It is of great value for visiting. I am a member of the industrial world, and I like to visit various factories. Hearing this news, I happily went to visit the factory on Funing Road in Yangshupu. Through the introduction of a friend and with the permission of the authorities, I followed the guide to the workshop. The machines roared, and the work was extremely tense. It was indeed a factory full of vitality. According to the guide, Manager Qian Xiangbiao studied in the United States for many years, specializing in machinery, and has a deep understanding of nail making. After returning, he organized this factory with his friend Ye Boyin and others. Through painstaking management, they have achieved this result.</p>
<p>In terms of equipment, there are currently sixteen nail-making machines, each of which can produce seventy or eighty barrels of round nails of various sizes in ten hours. The nails produced have the following advantages: "(1) The nail heads are round and even, with appropriate thickness: (2) The nail teeth are deep and firmly embedded: (3) The nail body is straight, unyielding, and unbending; (4) The nail tip is sharp and easily penetrates wood." In addition to nail making, there are also eight wire-drawing machines for drawing coarse wires into fine wires for nail making, thereby greatly reducing costs. There is a paper clip machine, so we will have domestic paper clips in the future, and we will no longer need to rely on imports. I heard that the China National Products Company is selling them for about ten cents per box. There is a barbed wire machine. It is said that the factory is currently actively expanding, and many other wire products will be launched one after another to meet the needs of society. After all, the factory's English name, Wire Product Co., is not limited to the manufacture of round nails.</p>
<p>In this year of promoting domestic goods, it is indeed worthy of praise to have such excellent domestic goods come into being, so I am happy to introduce them.</p>
<h3 id="e289">Notes on Visiting the China Industrial Machinery Manufacturing Factory <a href="#e289" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c289" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">289</a></h3>
<p>— Gan Chunquan</p>
<p>The China Industrial Machinery Manufacturing Factory is located at the intersection of Xiaoshadu Road and Macau Road in Shanghai. In terms of its history, it has always been part of the manufacturing department of the Commercial Press. In terms of its business scope, it specializes in manufacturing Shu-style Chinese typewriters. During this time, it went from Huadong Factory to Dadong Factory to Shiye Factory, undergoing several expansions and manufacturing. Recently, after the January 28th Incident, it was named the China Industrial Machinery Manufacturing Factory, with Mr. Song Mingde, the former director of the Chinese Typewriter Department of the Commercial Press, as the manager. Under Mr. Song's planning, the products have become more and more refined, and the business has become extremely prosperous. Now, by special contract with the Commercial Press, the manufacture of Chinese typewriters is the main product, and it also manufactures printing presses, instruments, stoves, desk calendars, and other products, which are also very popular in society. Yesterday, I received a special letter from Mr. Song, and the Shanghai Occupational Guidance Center sent me to visit. Those who went with me included Mr. Ni Baiyan, director of the China National Products Guidance Center. Now, I will write about what I saw during the visit to inform interested readers.</p>
<p>Chinese typewriters are related to cultural undertakings. They can replace writing, saving time and making reading easier. They have a wide range of applications. They were invented in the eighth year of the Republic of China [1919] by Mr. Shu Zhandong, and his contribution was great. Each machine has as many as 452 large and small parts. Because the parts are precision-made, the manufacturing is extremely serious. Most of the parts are manufactured by machines. If the parts made by the machines are deemed not accurate enough, they are transported to the fitter's department, where they are made very accurate and suitable for application by fine manual work. I will now describe the larger equipment of the factory that manufactures Chinese typewriters below.</p>
<p>(A) Lathe Department: This department has (1) small fine lathes, used for the more than 70 types of screws and perforated straight copper sheets; (2) universal large fine lathes, used for long-toothed parts with long grids and fixed plates with horizontal and vertical long teeth; (3) punch press, used for parts such as rolling drum walls and wall panels. There is also (4) an electric grinder for standby. (B) Fitter Department: This department is set up to use fine manual work to make the machine parts made by the lathe department very accurate when they are not accurate enough. All character pliers and grooved horizontal copper sheets in the character plate and various parts belong to this department. (C) Assembly Department: This department is specially set up for assembly after all the typewriters are made. Since a typewriter now has as many as 452 large and small parts, the assembly is done by skilled workers.</p>
<p>According to Manager Song, the factory can manufacture 15 Chinese typewriters per month, each worth 240 silver dollars. Currently, they are carefully studying to make the operation more responsive, reaching more than 1,200 words per hour, to facilitate the use of important documents such as official documents, letters, contracts, and agreements at any time. At the same time, they are trying to reduce costs so that all sectors can generally purchase them. Mr. Song's plan is of great benefit to the cultural sector. The other businesses of the factory, such as the production of printing presses, instruments, stoves, and desk calendars, are limited by space and cannot be fully described. Mr. Song welcomes visits from all sectors, and this is stated here.</p>

<p>— Yu Qiacheng</p>
<p>(1) Introduction</p>
<p>In our life process, we cannot go a day without clothing, food, housing, and transportation; however, these four aspects of people's livelihood in China have had several different periods. Looking back on the past and deciding on the future, we can only understand the phenomena of each period in detail and then choose what to take and what to discard!</p>
<p>(2) Before the Opening of the Maritime Ban</p>
<p>Clothing - homespun cloth</p>
<p>Food - domestic rice and wheat</p>
<p>Housing - all wood and bricks were made domestically</p>
<p>Transportation - boats and vehicles were all driven by Chinese people</p>
<p>Economic situation at that time: self-sufficient</p>
<p>(3) After the Opening of the Maritime Ban</p>
<p>Clothing - Adoration of foreign goods, homespun cloth was discarded</p>
<p>Food - Vegetables, rice and wheat were wholesale imported, Chinese tea was abandoned by Chinese people, and coffee was welcomed in China; even calculating candy, the leakage was enough to be shocking.</p>
<p>Housing - Building materials for Western-style houses, bricks, tiles, and foreign pine were mostly imported from abroad.</p>
<p>Transportation - The coal and gasoline for the power of boats and vehicles were mostly foreign products. Economic situation at that time: The people were poor and the country was exhausted.</p>
<p>(4) Current Transition Period</p>
<p>Clothing - Domestic silk and cloth have been improved, and the patterns and quality are not inferior to others.</p>
<p>Food - Sugar and sweets are mostly domestic products.</p>
<p>Housing - Brick and tile manufacturing also has factories run by Chinese people.</p>
<p>Transportation - ???</p>
<p>Current situation: National capital and foreign merchants are fighting.</p>
<p>(5) Future</p>
<p>Clothing, food, housing, and transportation, it all depends on how determined the Chinese people are. To be continued in the next episode.</p>

<h3 id="e293">New Cotton-Padded Jacket <a href="#e293" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c293" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">293</a></h3>
<p>— Hu Wen</p>
<p>It's getting cold, and the tattered cotton-padded jacket is still the one made five years ago. The wind drills in through the holes, like knives cutting the skin. It's really a bit too much! I've toughened my hide, so I can still bear it; but how can Ada, that little kid, be so thin-skinned and tender? A gust of wind comes, and he cries, shivering and whining. And my wife's heart always aches for the child, so she nags about it day and night.</p>
<p>Jin Sheng is really going to be driven to death!</p>
<p>No matter what, Ada has to have a new cotton-padded jacket made for him. My own cotton-padded jacket is too unsightly, and I have to get a new one too. Jin Sheng made up his mind, but where would the money come from? He had no choice but to discuss it with his wife and ask her relatives to borrow some money. Jin Sheng couldn't help but smile! He patted his rough, black hand on his pocket, and it was full of snow-white foreign coins!</p>
<p>The cloth was bought. A piece of flowery, colorful cloth for Ada's cotton-padded jacket, and a piece of black foreign cloth for himself. His wife took the flowery cloth, looked at it again and again, and then smiled with pursed lips. Jin Sheng also opened his big mouth and said triumphantly:</p>
<p>"Look! Is this cloth good or not? The price is also cheap! People say it's foreign goods, but who knows! What foreign goods, domestic goods, I don't understand at all! I only know to buy the one that's cheap!"</p>
<p>His wife praised his experience in buying cloth, which was even more abundant than a woman's, so Jin Sheng laughed again!</p>
<p>Wearing the new cotton-padded jacket, he felt the weather had become warmer. Ada also stopped crying.</p>
<p>Jin Sheng had to go to the mountains to collect firewood every day, and the thin branches broke his new cotton-padded jacket. Ada was playing with the little girl next door in the sun. The sun wasn't powerful, but it faded the color of Ada's flowery cotton-padded jacket.</p>
<p>His wife lost her temper and slammed the table, scolding:</p>
<p>"What's this! I borrowed money from the God of Wealth and worshiped the Bodhisattva to buy you these good foreign goods!"</p>
<p>How could foreign goods be so bad? Jin Sheng was really going to be driven to death!</p>

<p>— Yin Jiu</p>
<p>In front of a most modern three-dimensional building - a hostel, were parked new-style 1933 automobiles. The tall colorful archway obscured the original appearance and name of the hostel, undoubtedly making it known at a glance that this was a hall for holding a wedding ceremony. The endless stream of guests coming and going was enough to show that this "scene" was very grand.</p>
<p>After the wedding ceremony, the guests, especially the young people, forced the groom to report on his love story. The groom, Mr. Wang, was the winner of the National Language Speech Contest at ×× University, and of course began his report without any shyness:</p>
<p>"...The process of our love is very simple; as for the place where we first met, it was at the conference of the National Goods Promotion Association..."</p>
<p>The second time was at the counter of the China National Products Company. We developed friendship and love because of our shared will, so to put it simply, our introducer was national goods, so all the objects and clothing we use are made of domestic goods. At the same time, I hope that all the guests will also use domestic goods..." Then there was a burst of applause.</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3 id="e295">Circus <a href="#e295" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c295" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">295</a></h3>
<p>— Yang Yusheng</p>
<p>It is said that circuses are only for foreigners. This statement is probably discounted.</p>
<p>In China, everything likes to be "foreign," but there seem to be few people doing circuses. Even if there are, they are "rustic" and not worth watching!</p>
<p>The so-called circus, according to "reliable sources," is not entirely about horses performing; just as our Chinese monkey show is not entirely about monkeys performing. The latter, although not as beautiful as the former! There are rare birds and exotic animals, there are strongmen with bulging muscles, there are women with bare thighs; but pugs and sheep are indispensable! Sometimes, a bear can be brought out, which gives it a great circus style!</p>
<p>Circus and monkey show, judging from the words alone, can be sure that their content is different. However, both seem to need "people," especially circuses, where there are a lot of "people." They perform in the play, interject with humor, and are full of fun; in these places, you can see the distinction between "humans" and "animals."</p>
<p>However, the eyes of the audience seem to focus on the "animals," and only the strange performances of the "animals" are worthy of their praise. As for "people," if they are not women and do not have bare thighs, I am afraid they will not be as eye-catching as "animals"!</p>
<p>In fact, this is correct. They are watching "circus," and they are eager to see all kinds of wild animals that are not easy to see, so their attention to "people" is distracted. As for "women" and "thighs," that is an unexpected "bonus" for the average audience, getting some free fun. Chinese people seem to have an itch in their hearts when they talk about "getting some free fun," not to mention the young people, even the old people are not necessarily reliable!</p>
<p>In Shanghai, there is no opportunity to see monkey shows with "national essence," while the Haikingbo Circus Country has risen to take its place.</p>
<p>The former can fool the villagers more than enough, but the latter has caused the people of Shanghai to go wild for it!</p>
<p>I have not investigated what the word of mouth is for those who have seen the Haikingbo Circus. However, the declaration issued by Haikingbo in Shanghai cannot help but make me worry about China's "international status"!</p>
<p>According to him, he wants to collect all kinds of rare birds and exotic animals in China, and also wants to invite Chinese people to join their circus and show their faces in various countries.</p>
<p>This...um...what "people" do we have in China who can join the circus? If we ask "sellers of dog skin plaster" to make up the numbers, it would be really inappropriate. "Martial arts troupes" seem to lack "gentleman" demeanor, it is truly a sigh of lack of talent!</p>
<p>As for rare birds and exotic animals, it is really shameful to say that what can we offer to him in China? In the past, China did produce "Elaphurus davidianus" and other ferocious beasts, but they had long been subdued by Jiang Ziya in a loud shout of "evil animal"! In addition, the birds are not rare, and the beasts are not exotic, and there is nothing!</p>
<p>China is truly a "poor" country! But the audience in the circus last time was so crowded that it could be! This is enough to comfort Haikingbo of Anhui!</p>

<p>— Tong Chu</p>
<p>When the traffic light on the opposite side glared with its goldfish-like eyes, the rickshaw puller on this side held back the forward-moving carriage, the car driver turned the stop button, and the "puff puff puff" motorcycle just roared there; everything that was advancing on this side stopped. Everyone raised their eyes, hoping that the traffic light would change color immediately, glancing sideways at the vehicles passing arrogantly in front. The police officer on the traffic light platform blew his whistle, the color of the traffic light changed, and everyone hurriedly turned the machine parts, passing by more vigilantly than fleeing from a fire. At this time, on the road that could just pass, both sides of the intersection also bit the forward-moving vehicles, and they had no choice but to wait silently.</p>
<p>The bustling city is truly a bloody place! Tigers are leaping wildly, and jackals are chasing. Second after second, there is no escape from the terror of death. The great and bright traffic light, it jumps high, its eyes are wide open, its eyes are terrible! The wildly leaping tigers and jackals are subdued, and they pass by stealthily under its command.</p>
<p>We yearn for the great traffic light to jump into people's hearts; then "suspicion" and "hatred" will not occur. We yearn for the great traffic light to jump into this deformed society; then the weak will not be preyed upon.</p>
<h3 id="e297">Black Gold Seal and Black Gold Pestle <a href="#e297" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c297" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">297</a></h3>
<p>— Qing Fan</p>
<p>Black gold is a rare treasure in the world. During the Qing Dynasty, there were two items made of black gold: one was the black gold seal of Shi Dakai, the Wing King of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom. Shi was in the army and hung it by his side, never leaving it for a moment, loving it no less than his own life. Later, when attacking Sichuan, he was defeated by the Qing army Tang Junmen, and his seal was also obtained by Tang. By the time of the Republic of China, the Sichuan War broke out repeatedly, and Tang's descendants could not protect it. It was seized by a powerful man, and recently it was rumored to have fallen into the hands of a soldier named Li. The central government had telegraphed Liu Xiang to inquire, but there was no whereabouts yet. Another black gold product is the medicine pestle of the He Tongren Pharmacy in Guangdong. The handle of the pestle is made of ebony, and the hammer of the pestle is decorated with black gold. Although the volume is not very large, it can be used to crush and grind hard medicinal materials easily. Moreover, the medicine ground by it is also quite effective. For example, the most famous black gold eye drops of the pharmacy are used to treat all eye diseases and external hemorrhoids and boils, and they are truly effective in ten thousand trials. This medicine was created more than a hundred years ago and sold in South China and overseas. It has considerable influence. Recently, the three major companies in Shanghai have also sold it, and it is highly trusted by society. It is said that the medicine pestle is still in the pharmacy, and it is treasured as a family heirloom. Non-relatives and descendants cannot easily touch it.</p>

<p>Chapter 19: Wanting to Leave, Yet Reluctant, They Recall Past Events in the Same Car; Half-Crying, Half-Laughing, Leaning on a Pillow in the Sickly Autumn</p>
<p>Madam Jiang immediately leaned her head into the curtain and asked Guizhi, "Girl, what's wrong with you?" Guizhi had her eyes half-open, and only when she suddenly heard her mother's call did she open them and look. At the same time, her face felt icy cold, and she knew it was tears flowing down her face, which her mother had seen. In her heart, she thought, if her mother knew this secret, how terrible would that be? So she frowned, slightly smiled, and said, "I feel unwell all over, uncomfortable in my heart, probably caught a chill." Madam Jiang stood in front of the bed-platform, stared at her face for a while, and then said, "You're really like a child. If you catch a chill, just lie down under the covers for a while, why are you crying?" Guizhi reached out and grabbed a corner of the quilt, rubbing her eyes, and said, "Who's crying? These are tears from a fever." Seeing her smile, although it looked somewhat forced, she couldn't quite consider it to be from sadness; perhaps she really couldn't bear the illness and shed tears. So she asked her, "Then lie down properly; do you want me to cook some porridge for you?" Guizhi frowned and said, "No! If I did that, then I'd really look like I'm sick. Just leave me alone, let me lie down." As she spoke, she turned over and went to sleep on the inside of the bed-platform. Madam Jiang saw that she seemed to be a little impatient with being sick, so she didn't bother her anymore. When Guizhi first lay down, she only felt tired, but now that she had been lying on the bed-platform for a long time, she felt as soft as cotton, and she didn't even want to turn over. She felt drowsy and lay like this until the afternoon, and her body indeed felt comfortable, and she forgot all her troubles. But this was only for a short time; around seven o'clock in the afternoon, she had already woken up. (261)</p>

<h3 id="e301">A Discussion on Winter Tonics: Yam Puree - Food is Better Than Medicine - <a href="#e301" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c301" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">301</a></h3>
<p>— Ji Hongshan</p>
<p>Yam puree really has a delightful taste; it tastes good hot, and it tastes good cold. Upscale restaurants in Tianjin and Beiping sell it, and it's quite expensive, but not all of it is purely yam. Often, you pay a lot of money but don't get to eat the real thing. Here, I'll introduce how to make it, and yam is a famous tonic. Eating it now at the turn of autumn and winter is naturally much better than taking tonics. First, wash the whole yams clean, put them in a pot, and boil them with water for one or two hours until they are soft and mushy. Then peel off the outer skin, revealing the completely clean yam flesh. Put it in a stone mortar and mash it into a mud-like consistency, making sure there are no small pieces left. When eating it, put it in a pot and cook it with a small amount of cooked lard until it's thoroughly heated. Add white sugar to taste, and heat it thoroughly. In this way, the lard is also absorbed by the yam, and the taste is excellent.</p>
<p>Lard Stewed Dates</p>
<p>"Lard Stewed Dates" is not a bourgeois food. Usually, everyone knows about it, so there's no need to talk much about it. The method is to put good dates with a large amount of lard in a pot on top of the rice cooker and steam them for more than ten days. The dates will become plump and absorb a lot of oil. When people eat this, it increases the oil in the body and generates more heat. Fat people should definitely avoid eating it, otherwise, they will become unbearably ripe by next summer.</p>
<p>Walnuts and White Sugar</p>
<p>Pound the walnuts into small pieces, mix in an appropriate amount of white sugar and lard. It really invigorates the blood and strengthens the brain. People who drink alcohol can use it as a snack, which is very suitable. Even just mixing a cup of it with hot water every morning and eating it is very beneficial. However, when peeling the walnuts, you must peel off the inner skin, which is a bit more troublesome.</p>
<p>Nantang Water Chestnuts</p>
<p>This year's water chestnuts are two or three times cheaper than in previous years. Those who are financially well-off can eat more of them and replace breakfast, which is not impossible. This year, you can buy more than two pounds for one yuan, while last year, you had to buy one pound for more than two yuan, which is a big difference. It is enough to indicate that the rural economy has reached an extreme state of bankruptcy.</p>
<p>Milk</p>
<p>Ordinary milk, some of which are made into types A and B, has been tested by the Shanghai Municipal Council Health Department and divided into types A and B. Type A has three times fewer organisms than type B, and has already undergone disinfection procedures, so it's okay to drink it cold. But type B is not. When boiling type A milk, you only need to warm it slightly. If you boil it, the vitamins in the milk will also be burned off at the same time. Therefore, it is more appropriate to pay for the more expensive type A milk. Many milk farms opened by Chinese people themselves also have type A, which is worth recommending. Every half-pint costs about six yuan or less per month.</p>
<p>Eggs</p>
<p>A large number of eggs are produced in rural areas every year, and many are consumed in winter. Its efficacy and price need no further explanation from the author. It is also very relevant to the relief of rural areas. And for people with jobs, eating them in the morning is much more convenient than anything else. Especially in the inland areas, you can buy fifty or sixty very fresh eggs for one yuan, and the nutrients are enough to抵過抵過 ginseng and bird's nest, etc.</p>
<p>Beef Juice</p>
<p>Just put the chopped beef in a pot specifically for steaming beef juice, without adding anything else, and simmer it over a low fire overnight. The beef will all turn into beef juice. Chicken essence is made in the same way, but the internal organs, head, and feet are not used. The remaining dried meat can be dried and made into braised beef or coffee beef. Just cook it slightly and it will be soft and transparent, which can be used as a side dish. Two dimes worth of raw beef can be cooked twice, enough for one person for one meal.</p>
<p>Soy Milk</p>
<p>Everyone knows that soybeans are rich in protein and vitamins. Therefore, soy milk made from soybeans (commonly known as tofu pudding) is also very popular among hardworking comrades. A big cup in the morning doesn't cost more than five copper coins, which is really very affordable. There are stores that specialize in selling soy milk in the market. The author has not tried it, so I apologize for not introducing it. Making it yourself is naturally the most reliable and clean. The day before, soak the raw soybeans in water until they are plump, then mash them with a stone mortar and add water to filter them. Mash and filter them again, about three or four times, until only渣滓 only渣滓 remains. When eating, boil it over the fire and add a little white sugar. This is the cheapest and cleanest.</p>
<p>Most of the popular winter tonics are here. Other gelatinous medicines, ginseng, bird's nest, and white fungus are not affordable for everyone, and they are not necessarily suitable for everyone's constitution. The author will stop writing here.</p>
<h3 id="e302">Professor's Secrets <a href="#e302" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c302" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">302</a></h3>
<p>— Mingchun</p>
<p>A certain professor described the secrets of being a professor. I record it to provide to those who aspire to be professors.</p>
<p>1.  When going to the lecture hall, you should often mention your experience of studying abroad, such as "When I was in New York before." As for the names of your teachers, such as "John," "Smith," etc., you may as well mention them more often. It would be even better if you could say that you had a certain friendship with them.</p>
<p>2.  When taking on a certain subject, you must first collect reference books from various countries about this subject, and often say that you will add some criticism! Pretend to have read it! Finally, you must declare that there is not a single Chinese reference book that is worth reading.</p>
<p>3.  Take leave often to avoid people saying that you are not old enough, and at the same time, you can give the students some relaxation.</p>
<p>4.  When criticizing other people's theories, it is best not to be twelve-point worship, and you should often use the phrase "But my opinion is." In your own lecture notes, use the word "鄙意" (my humble opinion) more often to avoid being accused of plagiarism.</p>
<p>5.  During the exam, you should sit quietly and read the newspaper, and occasionally look out the window.</p>
<p>6.  As for state affairs, speak less to students about them (in fact, no matter how deep the national crisis is, we have few reactions in our hearts). Before hearing the sound of imperialist cannons, you may as well advocate the theory of saving the country through reading, which is what a scholar should be like.</p>
<p>The above points are for temporarily keeping your job. As for those who want to use teaching as a stepping stone to climb to the road of bureaucracy, I'm sorry, but it doesn't apply.</p>

<h3 id="e303">Commercial News, Finance, and American Bank Exchange Rate Suddenly Rises, Gold Price Returns to Six Yuan Ninety <a href="#e303" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c303" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">303</a></h3>
<p>Mexico Proposes Favorable Silver Agenda, and Rumors Spread that This Year's British Debt to the US Will be Converted to US Dollars</p>
<p>After the gold market rose the day before, yesterday the overseas silver market suddenly saw Britain maintain parity and the US rise. The five gold exchanges also saw the price of silver for far-term delivery rise by seven and a half to eight and a half cents. The exchange rate also rose. American cotton rose by seventeen points, American wheat rose by two and eight-seven-five points, stocks rose by three yuan and ten cents, and London raw gold rose by ten pence. Although the US official's purchase of newly mined gold did not change the price, people's minds were already weary. In addition, reports said that at the Pan-American Conference to discuss economic issues, the Mexican delegation would propose seven silver agendas, most of which were favorable to the silver price and unfavorable to the gold market. The market immediately fell, initially calling 912 yuan, then retreated to 889 yuan. After opening, it rose due to the banks' pull-up. However, upon hearing that the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation's (HSBC) listing of the US exchange rate suddenly increased by 0.625 and fell, breaking the 90 yuan mark again, but the banks still worked hard to pull it up. Speculator Wu emerged and re-entered, and the general hedge traded up to its benchmark. The gold price rose again. Finally, people's minds were at peace, and there was a lack of special changes. The fluctuations were narrow in the morning. Reuters reported that a British MP inquired of Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain, who replied that Britain would have to pay its war debts in US currency this time, abandoning the use of silver. Because of this, people's minds were exhausted and then stabilized. Due to the rise in the price of raw gold, the naked gold price rose to 1075 yuan. I will now record the market situation in the morning.</p>
<p>The morning opening was 690.5 yuan, a decrease of 9 yuan from the previous close. Goods opened at 0.8 yuan. The most recent selling price in the exchange market was 1 shilling, 3 pence, 5625, and the US exchange rate was 34 yuan, 125. Pan Gen Zhengjin pulled up the March US dollar by 0.0625. Yi Da, Yong Yuan Mao, Yong Sui Jin, Feng Ri Chang, Zhi Feng, Yong Yi Feng, Yong Xian Jin. HSBC then took in the April US dollar at 3.125, which rose to 3 yuan and 20 cents. Citibank then jammed the February US dollar by 0.625. Da De Cheng, Heng Yu, Shun Li, and Hui Xiang and others said they would sell, and Zhengjin jammed the February US dollar by 0.6875, which fell to 1 yuan and 20 cents. Yi Da, Yong Yuan Mao, and Yong Sui Jin. At this time, it was already learned that HSBC's listing had risen by 1.25 and the US had risen by 0.625 (it was once rumored that the US had risen by 0.375). Heng Tai, Heng Yu, Heng Xing, Zheng Chang, Yi Da, and Yong Chun Yuan Yong all sold, and then fell to 88.5 yuan. Shun Li vigorously pushed forward without stopping, and the situation stabilized again. Hui Xiang also purchased vigorously, and then rebounded to more than 90 yuan. Wan Xing and Zheng Chang bought in. Zhengjin pulled up the April US dollar by 4.375 and 3.75, and Zhongnan ate the same month by 3.125, which rose to 91.5 yuan. After entering the market, it hovered around one yuan for a long time, and people's minds were still good. Goods were also taken in, but because Fu Yu and Heng Yu and others had supply, it was difficult to rise to more than two yuan for a while. After entering the market, 조선 朝鮮 once pulled up the April US dollar by 3.125. Yuan Mao Yongjin reached 2 yuan and 40 cents, while Yi Da, Yong Zhi Feng, Yong Rui Kang sold it to 0.7 yuan. After spinning around, Goods, Da De Cheng, Heng Yu and others slightly took it in. The noon close was again collected to 692.6 yuan. After the close, Goods vigorously raised it, and Wan Xing and others also advanced, once rising to 3.5 yuan. Goods then patted 3 yuan. Finally, Zheng Chang came to sell, and then it fell again. It was found that the highest price in the morning was 693.2 yuan, and the lowest was 688.5 yuan, with a fluctuation of 4.7 yuan. As a result, it fell by 6.9 yuan compared to the previous close.</p>
<p>The posted price was 0.625 yuan higher than the HSBC US exchange rate, at 33.75 yuan, and the benchmark gold price was 711 yuan. According to the closing price, it was about 18 yuan, which was 6 yuan stronger than the previous close. The ledger for this month was 699 yuan, and the ledger for January was 693 yuan. The morning water replenishment was 699 yuan. The naked gold price was 1,075 yuan. There were not many transactions, and customers made some replenishment. It is estimated that the formal transaction price sold by peers to Tianjin help ranged from 1077.5 yuan to 1080 yuan, with a transaction volume of about 1,000 taels. The swap was still silent, lacking a formal opponent. There were only 4,438 strips left for this month.</p>
<p>The in-house transaction was mediocre, with most people selling first and then buying. In summary, Dalian help Shun Li Wan Xing and Yuan Chun Fu Yu Ying Feng Heng Heng Chang Yong Hong Li Yuan Heng Yuan Xing Yong Xiang He Yi Feng Yong and others were on the buying side, while Tong Tai Chang Rui Kang Bing Xing Heng Tai Zhao Feng Chang Da De Cheng Zheng Chang Chun Yuan Yong and others were on the selling side. Chang Sheng Yong Da De Cheng Yi Da Yong Zhi Feng Yong advanced first and then exited. Yuan Mao Hui Xiang Gan Chang Xiang Heng Yu and others exited first and then entered. Dalian help Shun Li did a total of more than 3,300 strips, hedging more than 1,400 strips. Wan Xing did a total of more than 2,300 strips, hedging about 900 strips. Guang help Heng Xing sold more than 100 strips, only tens of strips. The total number of chips in January was 31,091 strips.</p>

When HSBC's listing rose by 1.25 in Britain and 6.25 in the US, India, and other new countries rose by half. Germany fell by 25, and the rest did not change. The process of the announcement was hardened. Then, the banks took advantage of the cheap prices and scrambled to settle, and the situation was even. Although the Chinese merchants blocked it, there was no change in the end. The closing price near the market price was 1 shilling, 3 pence, 625 for the British exchange rate, and 34 yuan for the US exchange rate, which was a measure of level for the British and a hard 3125 for the US compared to the previous close. Banks such as Zhengjin HSBC and Citibank all pulled up, and broker Pan Gen also took it in. Chinese merchants blocked about 400,000 yuan, and Dalian help also blocked it.

Copper coins were 304,000 wen, a reduction of 1,000 wen compared to the previous change. The transaction was more than 36,100 strings, costing 11,900 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e308">Securities Short Sellers Are Increasingly Covering and the Public Debt Rises More Powerfully: It Rises Another Yuan or More to Two Yuan Twenty-Three: It Has Risen for Four Consecutive Days and Has Been Good for Five or Six Yuan. <a href="#e308" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c308" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">308</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, at the Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange, market prices continued to rise, even more vigorously than the day before. Judging from the environment, there was no particularly bullish reason. For example, the war in Fujian was still brewing and the war clouds were dense, with an arrow on the string. Although the southwest cooperated with the central government, it was superficially harmonious and alienated, and the so-called five conditions were quite unfavorable to the central government. The request for cotton and wheat loans to transfer and purchase public bonds was also just an air effect, but the bond market soared and went straight to the top. The strength of the rise was rare in recent months. It was actually the short sellers covering their positions, and the more they covered, the more they flooded, so it was not easy to fall back. However, it has risen for four consecutive days and has been good for as much as five or six yuan. The bulls are selling out, so we must be careful. Yesterday morning, all the gangs covered their short positions at the opening, mostly in the north. Most of the sellers were the four, twenty, thirty-three, and forty-nine numbers. The market price continued to rise by 5 jiao to 1 yuan and 2 jiao. In the second round, the fifty numbers sold a lot, and the above-mentioned varieties continued to improve by 2 jiao, 3 jiao to more than 1 yuan. The rise of the salt tax has been killed, and the gold short has been slightly down by 2 jiao, 3 jiao in the whole six. In the afternoon, there was still only one round. The market price was expected to ease slightly, but the reorganization and troop reduction was slightly less this month, only 3 jiao to 5 jiao. Since the troop reduction far-term began, it has gradually increased, and the northern gangs are still vigorously covering their positions and continue to improve by 5 jiao, 6 jiao to more than 1 yuan. The trend seems to be that there is still surplus power to rise. However, in this environment, the rise seems to be excessive, and we should be careful to prevent its reaction. As a result, the market price for the whole day rose by more than 1 yuan to 2 yuan and 2 jiao, 3 jiao. Only Jin Chang improved by 2 jiao. The total transaction volume was estimated to be more than 30 million yuan. Due to the late closing, it was not time to sort it out, so the details are omitted.</p>

<p>Xinfeng Foreign Firm reported on the 5th that the New York stock market soared by several corners to 5 yuan, and the transaction was very smooth. The abolition of liquor taxes and various reports confirmed that domestic commerce was gradually improving. Including that automobile production in 1934 will generally be 50% higher than this year. Traders then bravely bought in. Bonds, except for US government bonds, rose slightly. The entire day's transaction volume was 2,010,000 shares. (Wheat) Commercial progress is gradually becoming apparent, the number of buyers is increasing, and it is rising by more than two points. Also, because there is a popular rumor outside that the US Chamber of Commerce supports Roosevelt's monetary policy, but it is difficult to actually implement it. (Cotton) rose along with other markets and exchange rates, and the technical position was obviously quite good. The number of factories will be reduced by 25% in December, which is generally considered healthy. It is expected that the gauze industry will improve after the New Year. The price of the Financial Rehabilitation Agency's purchase of gold was 34.01 yuan per tael. I will not move the Dow Jones Index below.</p>

<p>The yarn market is still in a state of peace and exhaustion, with no ability to rise. It is found that the total number of yarn labels at the center is only 53,200 bales for a total of five months, and the number of net deposit accounts is only 53,200 bales. There are already 40,000 bales of yarn in the yarn warehouse. Judging from this situation, there are very few people who are shorting without goods. The current yarn demand in the market is quite clear. The current situation is such that the silver supply is tight and the market news is quite stagnant. However, it is said that the selling price of Japanese yarn is 5 yuan higher than that of Chinese yarn.</p>

<p>There were not many transactions when the human label opened in the morning market. The market atmosphere was gloomy, and the prices of various months rose and fell by 1.2.3 jiao. In the afternoon, I heard that current yarn transactions were not smooth, and there were not many buyers. The prices of various months fell by 2.4.6 jiao. The total number of transactions for the day was 10,900 bales. It was found that Suilong sold 850 bales, Changfeng 500 bales, Yuanda 1,800 bales, Yiyu 350 bales, and Yukang 400 bales. Dafeng bought 1,500 bales, Yichang 350 bales, Changyu 350 bales, Changfeng 900 bales, and Renfeng 450 bales. The closing prices are listed below.</p>

<p>The cotton market is trending upwards, with foreign cotton slightly rising, and the exchange rate is lengthening, secretly falling back. The buyer's intention is also healthy, and many say that the Indian and Japanese cotton industry meeting has broken down again. There was a saying that they would switch to purchasing Chinese cotton a few days ago, so scattered shorts covered their positions, and the market was tight. However, cotton yarn market prices are getting more and more exhausted, factory demand is very stagnant, and the silver supply is unusually tight. However, the overall situation is deteriorating, and it is feared that the future will be difficult to rise too much. The spot swap price of American cotton has broken the 40 yuan mark again.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the U.S. cotton market declined due to unfavorable news from Liverpool, but later rebounded with strength from Wall Street and buying, resulting in a spot price increase of fifteen "aiyin" (an obsolete phonetic unit) and futures prices rising by sixteen to eighteen "bangyin" (an obsolete phonetic unit). Liverpool cotton spot prices rose by three points, while futures prices fell by three points. Egyptian cotton spot prices rose by three points. The Bombay cotton market rose due to short covering, resulting in increases of one rupee and seven and a half annas for Pingar and White Raw Creek cotton, and two rupees for Oomra cotton.

<h3 id="e318">Flour and Imported Wheat Prices Set, Flour Weakens <a href="#e318" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c318" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">318</a></h3>
<p>After the opening of the flour market this morning, prices for all months showed a trend of rising first and then falling. With quotations for imported wheat rising in Chicago by nine "jiao" (a unit of currency) and in Canada by two "jiao," market sentiment remained firm at the opening, continuing a one "fen" (a unit of currency) improvement from the previous day's closing. However, the market soon turned soft. The selling of imported wheat was very active, with government-loaned wheat and Argentine wheat quoted at very low prices, only four yuan without tax and only four yuan and five or six "jiao" with tax. At the current market price, selling already yields a profit, so market sentiment became very weak. At the afternoon opening, it was heard that domestic factories had transacted a shipment of Argentine imported wheat at four yuan and four and a half "fen," leading to large-scale selling of over 200,000 units. Some factories also sold slightly, causing the market to fall across the board. With overseas spot wheat quoted so cheaply, future prospects are likely to be variable. As a result, the current month fell three "fen" compared to the previous day, January fell three "fen" and seven and a half "li" (a smaller unit of currency), February fell four and a half "fen," March and April fell three "fen" and seven and a half "li," and May fell four "fen" and seven and a half "li."</p>
<p>The wheat market opened this morning with a mixed but ultimately falling trend. Although imported wheat quotations rose by nine "jiao" in Chicago and two "jiao" in Canada, the market lacked vitality. Transactions were sluggish due to the fact that, despite occasional fluctuations in the price of standard imported wheat, the spot market was ultimately burdened by oversupply, making dumping inevitable. For this reason, buyers were apprehensive. At the afternoon opening, with the flour market having turned from rising to falling, the sentiment for all months also softened. It was heard that some parties were also engaging in hedging sales, leading to further instability in the market. As a result, the current month fell four "fen" compared to the previous day, January fell four "fen," February fell five "fen," and March fell five "fen." Spot wheat market transactions were very few. Top-quality goods opened at three "jiao" one, Shandong wheat opened at four yuan three "jiao," and Yaowan wheat at four yuan two "jiao" seven "fen," totaling three hundred packages, reportedly handled by Huafeng.</p>
<h3 id="e319">Late Rice Continues Good, Increase of "Jiao" or So <a href="#e319" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c319" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">319</a></h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the supply from various sources was not abundant, totaling about forty ships (over six thousand "shi" - a unit of volume). Late rice still accounted for about twenty ships. Two to three thousand packages were handled by Qingdao and Yantai merchants, so the market was stable and, with the continuous scarcity of arrivals, the trend seemed to be upward. The market prices of late rice such as Qingjiao, Songsi, and Xilian continued to rise, while the Japonica rice from Changbang, Sutongbang, and Nangang saw a continued good appearance due to strong demand, with prices rising by several "fen" to nearly a "jiao." Dujian rice also became tighter, and foreign-style pointed rice was able to rebound by nearly a "chi" (a unit of length). Although the Yinbian Yuan wine merchants were active, there was no gain or loss due to the abundance of goods.</p>
<p>(North Flow) Over fifty ships arrived from various routes. Sales of various goods at retail were quite brisk. New Japonica, Baiyuan, and early Bo rice prices increased by a "jiao" or so, while Yin Yuan, foreign Dudu, and Bu Xian rice prices tightened by several "fen." Guest Xian rice was stable.</p>
<h3 id="e320">Guest Yuan Rice Sells Actively – Guest Xian and Guest Hua Falter <a href="#e320" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c320" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">320</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's market for Guest Xian rice saw no further shipments from Fujian Province's Fuzhou, Quanzhou, Xiamen, and Shantou due to the lack of steamers. Currently, only the British-owned merchant ships of Taikoo and Jardine's are sailing to Fujian, while China Merchants, Sanbei, and other Chinese merchant ships have long been suspended. Not only are there no ships daily, but even when ships are available, loading is not easy. After the suspension of various shipments yesterday, the market returned to a quiet state, but shippers were unwilling to sell cheaply, and prices remained stable. Later, Guangzhou merchants handled one hundred and ten packages of Wuxi Yangjian rice at seven yuan and six "jiao," and Quanzhou merchants also handled two hundred and twenty packages of stored Hunan machine-milled red rice at seven yuan. There were no other transactions. Guest Yuan rice has seen active arrivals and sales recently, with the local market showing the strongest demand and booming arrivals. The market has stabilized. Yesterday, the local market handled six hundred and fifty-five packages of Jiangxi machine-milled Yuan rice at seven yuan five "jiao" eight "fen" to seven yuan four "jiao," and at seven yuan at the lowest, fifty packages of Wuxi machine-milled Yuan rice at eight yuan, and four hundred and forty-five packages of Wuhu machine-milled Yuan rice at seven yuan six "jiao" to seven yuan four "jiao" nine "fen," distributed by the local market and Ningbo merchants.</p>

<p>Yesterday, Chongming sand yellow soybeans saw sluggish sales and a weakening market. Doudou arrivals were still scarce, and the market was stable. Although the source of beans from the Jinpu Railway area was not surging, market sentiment remained weak. Fortunately, sales channels remained open, so the market fluctuated within four or five "fen." Yesterday, factories handled three cars of Bengbu beans, one car of Yuanzhou beans, and two cars of Suixikou beans. Inland car dealers handled two cars of Dangshan beans, two cars of Haozhou beans, and one car of Guide beans. The local market purchased two cars of Zhengyangguan beans.</p>
<h3 id="e322">Sugar Market: Slab White Opening Prices Slightly Soften <a href="#e322" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c322" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">322</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market saw a slight improvement in trend due to the rise in customs gold. The Association's opening price for Grade 24 raw sugar white ordinary goods was five "fen" higher, at nineteen yuan eight "jiao," but no deals were made. Grade 89 Dutch red ordinary goods were at fifteen yuan six "jiao," with higher prices at fifteen yuan seven "jiao," without any changes. Taikoo granulated white B mark was at five "fen" higher, at twenty yuan and zero point zero five "fen," and also opened for over ten thousand packages of immediate loading this month, with B mark at three yuan eight "jiao," CW mark at three yuan seven "jiao" five "fen," DY mark at three yuan six "jiao," HX mark at three yuan five "jiao," and the remaining PXHO marks all at three yuan five "jiao." Zhenji Kapok White No. 1 was quoted at eighteen yuan seven "jiao" five "fen," with the rest unchanged. Over a hundred baskets of high-grade slab green sugar were at ten yuan two "jiao," and then Guangzhou merchants deliberately released exchange, throwing out several hundred baskets of road goods at nine yuan eight "jiao," with the market fluctuating by as much as four "jiao" that day. Although they were road goods, they would soon arrive in Shanghai, so the slab green sugar market appeared weak.</p>
<h3 id="e323">North-South Goods: Aged Cassia Bulbs and High-Grade Zhuang Slightly Rise <a href="#e323" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c323" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">323</a></h3>
<p>Since the changes in the Fujian Bureau, arrivals of aged cassia bulbs have been scarce. Stocks of this type of goods were not abundant to begin with, and merchants, fearing a disruption in later batches, eagerly sought to acquire them. Therefore, most of the aged goods stored in various shops yesterday had already been opened for sale. Before opening, there was a soft trend, but due to the limited arrivals, large-sized goods actually opened higher by several "jiao," while mid- to low-grade goods remained flat.</p>

<p>Mountain Silkworm Cocoons Continue to be Shipped to Shanghai: Merchants of Hang-Shao silk are actively shipping silkworm cocoon scraps stored inland to Shanghai for sale or to pledge for loans, as the end of the year approaches. Yesterday, fifty-eight pieces of Xiaoshan silkworm cocoons arrived in Shanghai by Shanghai-Hangzhou train and are awaiting sale.</p>
<p>Sales of Rayon Remain Difficult to Improve: As winter arrives, domestic consumption of rayon has decreased significantly, and sales to customers are difficult. Yesterday, only Hangzhou silk factories Jindeki first and second grade Liuhai and other brands entered sixteen boxes of this month's futures at prices ranging from one hundred seventy-seven yuan two "jiao" five "fen" to one hundred fifty yuan five "jiao" net.</p>
<p>Overseas Silk Sales Remain Quiet: Although silk weaving factories in New York have gradually resumed operations and raw silk consumption is gradually increasing, silk stocks are abundant and the silk market shows no improvement. Although Shanghai American firms are trying to support the market, the opening price of B-grade white factory silk, with an average quality of 83 points, is only 500 yuan, and factories still insist on not selling due to heavy losses. Yesterday, only printing houses entered five packages of Huang factory silk and three packages of Baigan silk, with prices remaining stable.</p>

<p>Yesterday, Yih Ho foreign company slightly supplemented its stock of Spring Tip Precious Eyebrow green tea from Wuyuan Road shops due to demand from overseas, negotiating a deal for over eighty boxes. The market opened at 170 yuan, a decrease of four or five yuan compared to the previous decline. In addition, Chinese-foreign companies also entered some small amounts of Needle Eyebrow, Show Eyebrow, and other items. Due to the recent sluggish sales, selling prices have also fallen by two or three yuan. Although current stock levels on all routes are low, market sentiment is very cold, and tea prices are still expected to fall rather than rise.</p>

<p>Since the changes in the Fujian Bureau, the hardware market in Shanghai has shown a sluggish trend, and transactions with out-of-town merchants have reached the end of their strength. Therefore, the overall market situation is very quiet. However, the market for Huisi iron is exceptionally good, with prices increasing by five "jiao" per box. Goods from the New Steel Factory are opening at 28 yuan five "jiao," and goods from the Old Steel Factory are opening at 30 yuan. It was found that 280 boxes were opened in the market yesterday, all of which were purchased by merchants from Tianjin and Qingdao. Tobacco factories have no transactions due to unified tax issues; otherwise, the future prospects of the market would be more optimistic.</p>

<p>— Meng Ke</p>
<p>At the intersection of a bustling thoroughfare, on the corner of the sidewalk to the left, stood a telephone pole, washed grey-white by the rain. Nailed to it was a red-lacquered iron sign, neatly inscribed in white paint with the name of the Fairweather Road and the fare schedule. Beneath the iron sign, there were piles of advertisements for "Milky White Cure-Alls," their characters already somewhat blurred. Beside the pole, as usual, stood a crowd of impatient people, clamoring, sometimes craning their necks, peering anxiously at the end of the road: their faces generally tense and resentful. But slowly pacing back and forth, as if eternally attached to this telephone pole, was a stooped, wizened, monkey-like female beggar. Though it was deep autumn, she wore only a piece of burlap, caked with mud, wrapped around her body. Her face was the color of vegetables. Her yellow hair, soaked by the rain and then dried into brittle strands, always hung down her arms. But anyone who caught sight of the raw, festering hole in the center of her face, dripping with yellow pus, would feel as if something was missing, and immediately think of the horrors of syphilis.</p>
<p>She moved slowly through the crowd, her coffee-colored, dry-twig-like hand stretching out from under the burlap, opening, bowing and smiling, politely addressing all sorts of people. The impatient people grew even more impatient, ladies tightened their grip on their purses, frowned, swung their large hips, and hurried away. She seemed quite sensible, didn't pester them. Those who she followed closely were the short-clad men in "hunting caps," reeking of gasoline. She still addressed them as "masters," but the men weren't necessarily pleased by this. At first, they too shook their heads, looking embarrassed, but eventually, out of the pockets holding measuring tapes or iron pliers, they'd fish out a couple of copper coins, though some, after extending their rough hands, would reluctantly pull them back.</p>
<p>In this rather busy occupation, she lived.</p>
<p>Until dusk, when the colorful electric lights of the grand stores lit up, she seemed to notice her own fatigue and hunger, but she didn't leave the area. Leaning against the telephone pole, the raw, festering hole in the center of her face still dripped with yellow pus, as if she was dozing off, or as if she was longing for the clatter of bowls and chopsticks and the sounds of song and laughter from the restaurant across the street.</p>
<p>Business at the restaurant was especially good at night. At the front door, cars and chartered carriages formed a serpentine line. Jovial gentlemen with big bellies hopped out of the cars, some followed by formidable toughs. The carriages, however, were occupied by pretty young ladies, who giggled and chatted, with an old woman hobbling along behind them, straight into the front door.</p>
<p>Beside the telephone pole, a crowd of impatient people still stood, clamoring, until there was no more sound of bowls and chopsticks or song and laughter from the restaurant.</p>

<p>— Ye Yongye</p>
<p>Two, The Horse's Dance</p>
<p>Only one horse came out, desolately.</p>
<p>But although there was only one horse, this horse was very tall, its coat pure black. Astride the horse was a woman dressed entirely in white. In the light, the colors were extremely harmonious.</p>
<p>Seeing this horse walking slowly in the arena, I was almost perplexed.</p>
<p>Suddenly, someone tossed out a "modern" word from behind: "Dance."</p>
<p>Fortunately, I was "blessed" to have studied for a few years, and understood the meaning of "Dance." Examining the horse's footsteps and listening to the music from the platform, the horse was indeed "Dancing."</p>
<p>I felt a bit of interest and began to watch attentively, thinking that I had never been to a dance hall. Although I had never seen people "Dance," being able to see a horse "Dance" was not a bad stroke of luck. The horse's "Dance" was indeed quite good: as the music began on the platform, it began to sway back and forth and dance. When the sound slowed down, its steps slowed down; when it sped up, its steps sped up. When it became urgent, it lifted its front hooves and kicked left and right in the air. When it stopped, it stopped immediately and stood still.</p>
<p>But of course, controlling it was the woman riding on its back.</p>
<p>Everyone in the arena clapped.</p>
<p>I clapped too.</p>
<p>There was nothing to criticize, given the way its steps matched the rhythm of the music. No one could help but admire it, given its intelligence and ability to learn such a technique.</p>
<p>And so, the horse danced with increasing delight, even wagging its tail, as if it was keeping time.</p>
<p>I felt a pang of shame.</p>
<p>And yet, for the sake of this horse, I also felt a pang of shame. I felt that since this horse was so tall and so intelligent, why wasn't it galloping on the battlefield or in the countryside? Instead, it let a woman ride on its back and manipulate it, telling it to do this and that, to do so and so?</p>
<p>Was being a puppet of a woman more glorious than relying on its own strength to survive?</p>
<p>I didn't believe so.</p>
<p>But things in the world are truly hard to say. We don't need to speak ill of the horse. As for humans, aren't there many promising young people, like this horse, who want to be a woman's puppet, letting her ride on their backs and do whatever she pleases? As long as the reins in her hand move, how happily does the ridden person jump!</p>
<p>You don't think about how ugly this looks in the eyes of others, and seem to believe that the woman riding on your back is truly your master. Putting all your fantasies and hopes into your own steps, you let the mocking people clap and laugh beside you in your illusions, and you yourself, like this horse, sway and strut along step by step.</p>
<p>You will believe that this is your happiness.</p>
<p>"Happiness, happiness!" you shout wildly.</p>
<p>And so, you dance even more vigorously, perhaps wagging your tail to estimate how much happiness you have, just like the horse wagging its tail to keep time.</p>
<p>I know that I once "Danced" like this horse, and my face couldn't help but turn red.</p>
<p>Today, I see the ugliness of my past posture.</p>
<p>I must thank this horse.</p>
<h3 id="e329">Small Notes from a Traveler's Window <a href="#e329" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c329" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">329</a></h3>
<p>— Shu Liu</p>
<p>Zhu Shuzhen is known for her poetry, but her prose is also exceedingly elegant, and her calligraphy is not weak either. She has a small-script copy of Su Ruolan's "Brocade-Weaving Revolving Sphere Poem," to which she attached her own small note. In addition to introducing the history of Su Hui and interpreting the "Revolving Sphere Poem," this note contains many sentiments. The final section reads:</p>
<p>"I have meticulously copied and interpreted it, keeping it in my satchel for eleven years. Since I married, I have been burdened by worldly affairs, my head aches and I fear the wind, my thin wrist trembles, and I cannot control myself. Could it be that I am driven by curiosity? Alas! With Ruolan's skill, she could weave it in the past; but without my labor, it could not be understood in the present. Why are the ages different but the ambitions so similar? I wonder who in the future will study this diagram. I hope that those who see it will not think that a woman should not engage in internal cultivation but be boastful of engaging in literature and art, which is not beautiful. If so, they are not talent-loving scholars. Please do not dare to argue, and may those who share my heart be like me. Alas, I sell it." The note ends with nineteen characters: "Written by recluse Zhu Shuzhen in the auspicious month of April in the third year of Shaoding in the Huang Song Dynasty." From this, we can glimpse a facet of Shuzhen's life and her inner indignation regarding the understanding of women in feudal society; as for the article, that is a secondary matter.</p>
<p>Seven</p>
<p>Yuan Zhonglang greatly praised the book "Jin Ping Mei," as recorded in his "Weishui Xuan Diary":</p>
<p>"November 5th (Wanli 43rd year). Shen Boyuan brought the novel 'Jin Ping Mei' collected by his uncle Jingqian. It is mostly extremely obscene vulgar talk, and the flames are far inferior to 'Water Margin.' Yuan Zhonglang praised it profusely, which is also excessive curiosity."</p>
<p>Although Li Rihua and Yuan Hongdao belonged to the same school in terms of ideological system, they did not agree on many points. The difference in their understanding of the book "Jin Ping Mei" suggests this. Yuan has a poem "Ode to Junshi," which was written for Li and included in the book "Crazy Words."</p>
<p>Eight</p>
<p>From my notebooks of several years ago, I came across a short poem that I copied at the time—"Leopard Order." The poem reads:</p>
<p>"Rare goods are worth hoarding, as the saying goes.</p>
<p>As the saying goes, I'm waiting to sell thousands of miles of territory to the Yuan Dynasty.</p>
<p>Unlike Jing Ke, I don't use useless tricks to acquire Dukang.</p>
<p>Master, you're like Zhang Song presenting Yizhou in your own hands,</p>
<p>True goods need a high price."</p>
<p>The source was not specified at the time. I don't know if it is from the zaju "Zhang Song Presents the Map" in "Selections of Yuan Operas." Today, when I discuss it again, I feel something else. Such satire can be described as extremely clever.</p>
<p>Nine</p>
<p>There are many poems describing the hardship of life. Lu You's "Young, traveling far without a hundred miles, one hunger forces me to walk to the ends of the earth," and Zhong Que's "Overworked and old, it's difficult to support eight mouths," "Fearing the cold but insisting on coming into the cold, our generation is not as good at making a living as geese." Such poems, at least until today, are "ever new."</p>
<p>Ten</p>
<p>Yellow leaves are most evocative in poetry. After writing the article "Talking about Yellow Leaves," I saw many more. For example, Wu Shaoyun's "White lotus withers, people seek the shrine, yellow leaves bleak, magpies call in the village," "Autumn sounds gather in the yellow gathering, mountain shadows in the evening smoke," and "Bamboo light like a sea, green clouds stop, distant temple bells heard several times. Walking to the end of Zhaodi, yellow leaves slightly, across the river the mountain color reaches the door" (from Lingyin to Taoguang) can be said to be rare good lines. Yuan Zhonglang's poems also sometimes use "yellow leaves," but there are not many good lines. However, from his "Splitting yellow leaves to stop children from crying," we can know that "yellow leaves" still have other uses. I remember that Wu Linzheng of the Ming Dynasty wrote to his uncle Shengbai, "Also, I heard that the uncle did not enter the capital gate with a single piece of paper, which is difficult to bear in old age. Now, the essential passes are tired of fruit and meat, and the small yellow leaves are not enough to stop children from crying. What about saving them to keep peace and integrity? The uncle means to say this?" His meaning is the same as Yuan's poem, using "yellow leaves" as a metaphor for something that cannot satisfy people. I specially attach this note to supplement the shortcomings of the previous article.</p>
<h3 id="e330">The Two Brothers (51) <a href="#e330" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c330" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">330</a></h3>
<p>— Written by Maupassant, Translated by Li Weike</p>
<p>But no, she had deceived him, she had stolen his tenderness, stolen his sincerity, and she ought to have been without fault to be worthy of him, as all mothers should be for their sons. Because he felt that she had committed a greater crime against him than against his father, that surge of anger that arose in him almost turned to hatred.</p>
<p>The love of men and women is originally a contract of desire. When love wanes, the sin is merely infidelity; but when that woman becomes a mother, then because nature has entrusted her with a race, her obligations are greater. If she cannot insist at this time, she is cowardly, base, and shameless.</p>
<p>"In short, it's not a bad thing to have a modest fortune and live a comfortable life," Father Roland suddenly said, stretching his legs out under the table, sipping his glass of Cassis (liquor made from black raspberries) as he did every night. "I hope Zhan will often invite us to eat elaborate dinners in the future. Even if I sometimes get a little sick because of it, I won't care."</p>
<p>Then he turned to his woman and said:</p>
<p>"Since you've finished eating, go find that portrait. I'd be happy to see him again."</p>
<p>She stood up, took a candle, and went out. Afterwards, the deliberation was actually only three minutes, but to Pierre it seemed like a long time. Mother Roland smiled as she came in with the portrait framed with old-fashioned gold borders. She was holding the ring on the frame when she said, "I almost found it right away."</p>
<p>The doctor reached out his hand first. He took the portrait, stretched out his arm, and examined it from a little distance. Then, feeling his mother watching him, he slowly raised his eyes and looked at his younger brother for comparison. Given his agitated mood at that time, he almost wanted to say, "Wow, it's just like Zhan." Although he didn't say those terrible words, he used this method of comparing the living face with the face in the painting to express his thoughts.</p>
<p>True, the two faces had some identical organizations; they had the same beard and the same forehead, but there was nothing obvious enough to make people declare: "Wow, this is the father, this is the son." It's better to say that it's a kind of family appearance, a similarity in appearance that is manifested by the same blood. But to Pierre, what was more certain than the appearance of these two faces was that his mother stood up, turned her back, and slowly pretended to be putting sugar and Cassis away in a cabinet.</p>
<p>She already knew that he knew, or at least that he suspected!</p>
<p>"Let me see," Roland said.</p>
<p>Pierre handed him the portrait, he moved the candle closer to look at it carefully; then he whispered in a moved voice:</p>
<p>"Poor child! We knew him when he looked like this. Alas, how quickly time passes! He was indeed a"</p>
<p>"Handsome man at that time, and his actions were so interesting, wasn't he, Louise?"</p>
<p>Seeing that his woman didn't answer him, he continued:</p>
<p>"And what a good nature he had! I never saw him angry. Well, it's over now, nothing is left"</p>
<p>"Besides the property left to Zhan. In short, we can swear that this person showed himself to be a faithful good friend until his death. He didn't even forget us when he was dying."</p>
<p>Now it was Zhan's turn to reach out and take the portrait. He stared at it for a while, then said with regret: "As for me, I don't recognize him at all. I only remember his white hair falling about his face."</p>
<p>Then he handed the portrait back to his mother, who glanced at the portrait quickly, and then quickly turned her eyes away, as if she were a little frightened; but then she said in her natural tone:</p>

<h3 id="e331">My Distorted Environment <a href="#e331" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c331" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">331</a></h3>
<p>— Fiery Flame</p>
<p>Speaking from a certain standpoint, it was obviously an immoral act. Although, on the scale of immorality, it had been acknowledged since ancient times and didn't count as a crime, upright gentlemen couldn't help but feel some disgust. As for me, from then until now, I've been certain: the environment forced me to become so distorted.</p>
<p>The matter occurred in the nineteenth year [of the Republic, i.e., 1930], at which time the Shanghai publishing world was in the heyday of introducing and compiling new social science books. The market was much more prosperous than it is now. What was posted on the signboards of bookstores wasn't "big sale" or the tiresome "half-price bargain sale," but rather "welcome to browse," "new book release," or "publication preview." The news disclosed in newspapers daily was also mostly publishing news. Because of this, the bookstore owners all had a bit of pride, their bellies protruding as they sat on the counter behind the brass railing, looking as if they were rising higher and higher in status. Book prices became more expensive day by day. A small booklet of only a hundred-odd pages often sold for more than seven or eight jiao [cents]; if it was a famous work and also thicker, then you couldn't even think of getting your hands on it for less than two yuan. Another thing was that books published not long ago would suddenly "increase in price according to the original price plus one," in short, they were incredibly expensive.</p>
<p>This means it was the era of the bookstore owners. They had grasped the minds of the intellectual class under the wheels of the times. Since the books published were speculative and to their liking, the prices naturally became "even higher than before."</p>
<p>However, there were indeed many poor young men who deeply couldn't bear this kind of grandstanding, and could only quench their thirst by looking at plums, dazed by advertisements. But poor young men mostly liked to read a bit, especially in that kind of emerging publishing atmosphere, eagerly crying out for knowledge. At that time, I was loafing around in a national school. Although the school was national, the library was pitifully poor. Precisely because the new books in the bookstores at that time were said to have some reactionary color, unlike the Three Principles of the People, which spoke of reason in a proper and orderly manner, the library director didn't pay attention to these when drawing up the book list, and only cared about purchasing ancient books in large quantities. I myself was too poor to stand up straight, but my desire for knowledge was very strong. Under these circumstances, I had repeatedly thought about "stealing books."</p>
<p>However, at that time, my mind was still somewhat constrained. I felt that I was a dignified university student, and "stealing" was truly not appropriate for me to commit lightly. If something went wrong, how could I face anyone? Even if I wasn't thrown into prison, I still wouldn't be able to account for myself, so I just thought and hesitated, not daring to try it lightly.</p>
<p>One day, attracted by an advertisement—"welcome to browse"—I went to the so-called Culture Street. It was truly lively. Every bookstore was crowded to the point where water couldn't leak through. Buying, reading, flipping through, perhaps there were many comrades of mine inside. So, in the midst of the crowd, I attempted the opening act of "stealing." My heart was uneasy, as if there was a buzzing sound in my ears, and the face of the oily boss was shaking before my eyes. However, I ultimately triumphed. On the tram ride back to school, I flipped through the pages, one by one. I smiled, desperately suppressing the "counterattack" mentality. Then, I performed many more acts, many days. So, my bed, desk, and shelves were filled with the new books I had longed for all my life. I smiled at any time. I cherished and caressed them, read them. Originally, I didn't have many books at all, but later I suddenly became a book-collecting nouveau riche. To be frank, they were all stolen.</p>
<p>However, in the past few years, they have gradually decreased again. Now, there are almost none left. Either they were lent to friends and never returned, or they seemed to have run away one by one, just like they were visiting each house. But I am already satisfied with them, because they have already made a contribution to me, enabling me to barely manage to pick up a pen.</p>
<h3 id="e332">The Four-Six Split <a href="#e332" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c332" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">332</a></h3>
<p>— Sword Screen</p>
<p>Our neighbor, Mrs. Tang, because she lost a beloved daughter last year, made a special trip to Jiangwan yesterday to call upon an old woman who communicates with the dead. It is said to be very effective. Not only can she answer the father's name and occupation, but she even knows that she went to see a movie yesterday. Do you think it's strange or not?</p>
<p>My family's younger brother, Zhi-di, sacrificed himself in the Shanghai battle two years ago. Thinking of his heroic spirit, his soul should also be more effective than someone who died of illness. So, I really want to contact him and comfort my pain of losing a wing. But it is said that the rules for contacting the dead require sending a servant to register overnight, so that the souls can be found calmly and not mistaken for someone else. This makes it difficult for me, a poor scholar who has never had a servant. However, after all, brotherhood is deep, so after hesitating for a while, I decided to temporarily lose my identity as a teacher and go to register myself.</p>
<p>As I stepped into the gate of this old woman who communicates with the dead, I suddenly heard a very familiar voice coming from the long window inlaid with oyster shells. I stopped to ponder for a while, and then remembered that it was A-gen, the cook from the Tang family.</p>
<p>"Why are you only giving me one yuan and twenty cents?" A-gen asked.</p>
<p>"Yes, we usually split the commission with the message carriers four-six. Your wife took out three yuan and sixty cents. After deducting the sixty cents for incense and candles, isn't that three-fourths, one yuan and twenty cents, for you? Moreover, when you came to register, the information you provided was not very detailed. You didn't mention the young mistress's name, which almost made me mess up on the spot. If I weren't a thirty-year veteran, able to roll my tongue and get through it, things would have gone bad," replied an old woman's voice.</p>
<p>After hearing this fragment of their conversation, it was as if a ladle of cold water had been poured over my head, abruptly dropping my enthusiasm to a freezing point. So, I quickly backed up and fled from this ghostly door.</p>

<h3 id="e333">The Dream of Higher Examinations <a href="#e333" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c333" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">333</a></h3>
<p>— Hui Gu</p>
<p>"What a rare opportunity, the higher examinations are being held again this year. Well, I'm going to try it out."</p>
<p>"Originally, when people go to take higher examinations, they wouldn't announce it to others, because once they fail, they feel very embarrassed. Only I am not like that, I insist on announcing it to everyone, but I also ask everyone to forgive me. Once I fail, please don't laugh at me."</p>
<p>"Nonsense, nonsense, would we laugh at you? Besides, Mr. Zhu is also very easygoing," the classmates said, with a very polite tone and a look of hoping that Mr. Zhu would continue speaking.</p>
<p>"As for why I want to take the higher examinations, the reasons are very complicated. I was most excited by that sentence of Merton's, he said: 'The weak give up opportunities, only the weak can seize opportunities,' hey, how exciting is that! I think this sentence is really valuable, so I desperately seize this opportunity. Another layer is that the fortune teller said that I have a prosperous official career, and there will be success within this year. In any case, although this can't be considered a meaningful attraction, it is also very touching to me. Besides, being a teacher seems very noble in name, but in reality, this chalk life of a teacher is the most unfortunate, because this profession doesn't seem to suit my personality. For this reason, I want to change the environment again, so I go to take the exam... there are many reasons, please forgive me for not saying more!" Mr. Zhu suddenly stopped at this point, he looked at the ceiling with a smile, perhaps he was thinking about something.</p>
<p>The classmates sat happily, and Mr. Zhu continued:</p>
<p>"This time, I am taking the general administration aspect of the exam. If I pass, I will also be able to be a county magistrate. The sentence is that it is very difficult to be admitted at all. The first exam requires taking the second exam. The first exam includes finance, economics, the Three Principles of the People, Chinese, history, geography, etc. The second exam is even more annoying. As far as the first exam is concerned, I already feel a lot of difficulty, and now that I am going to take the exam, I have to temporarily hug the Buddha's feet and open the night train, alas, just like when you are going to take the exam."</p>
<p>"Hush, hush, alas,"</p>
<p>"Regardless of anything else, even if I only attend the higher examinations, I will gain some life experience, which may help my writing. I will go to Nanjing next week, so I will ask Mr. Ma to take my place temporarily,"</p>
<p>"Oh, County Magistrate Zhu, County Magistrate..." the classmates laughed mischievously.</p>
<p>Two weeks have passed, the higher examinations have also been taken, and our Chinese teacher - Mr. Zhu - has also returned!</p>
<p>"County Magistrate, County Magistrate is here!" the classmates laughed secretly when Mr. Zhu came into the classroom.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhu also looked at us with a smile.</p>
<p>"Mr. Zhu, what is the result of the exam?"</p>
<p>"It's just so-so, I think I'm doing well, right? Why? Because I see that many people have handed in blank papers, which is ten thousand times worse than me - and I want to tell you that some of the difficult questions, I circled around and wrote a big sheet, but in fact they were all irrelevant words, just perfunctory, but maybe I can get a few points from them, you have to know that this is really a way to take the exam! Some kinds of exams are good, some kinds of exams are not good, probably, on average, there will always be a passing score!" Mr. Zhu recited with great interest.</p>
<p>"Then isn't a county magistrate stable?" Old Wang asked interestingly.</p>
<p>"No, I can't decide!"</p>
<p>"Don't be polite."</p>
<p>"The results will be announced in five days, and then I will know!" Mr. Zhu said so definitely.</p>
<p>"Mr. Zhu will definitely pass the exam in five days! Definitely, it must be a county magistrate"</p>
<p>"Is Mr. Zhu fierce as a county magistrate?"</p>
<p>"Chuckle" He smiled!</p>
<p>"Ha! Ha! County Magistrate!"</p>
<p>The announcement has been published, but we didn't see Mr. Zhu's name. Ha, ha, not only Mr. Zhu alone, but also we, everyone had a "dream of higher examinations"!</p>
<h3 id="e334">One Night of Terror <a href="#e334" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c334" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">334</a></h3>
<p>— Hui Liu</p>
<p>As long as they are from Wangjiaji [Wang Family Village], everyone knows that Wang the Rich is very wealthy; at the same time, his fields are also the most in this area. There are more than 400 households in the entire village, more than half of whom make a living by farming. The fields they cultivate are all owned by Wang the Rich. Therefore, he has some influence in the village. His home is in a tall, black-lacquered gate that is ten feet high at the north end of the village. The neighbors are all piles of broken houses—the dwellings of the poor. Among these many dilapidated houses, Wang the Rich's residence is even more spacious and magnificent!</p>
<p>At this time, it was the middle of winter. Because it hadn't rained for a long time, a thick layer of sand and dust had accumulated on the ground. It was blown by the merciless north wind, making it feel particularly cold and annoying. As evening approached, the wind grew stronger, and the night god gradually swallowed everything in space. On the road from the village to the north end, in addition to the footsteps of one or two pedestrians, only the sound of the whistling wind could be heard. By nine or ten o'clock at night, even the pedestrians had disappeared. In the distance, a few barks of dogs were heard. Immediately, three dark shadows窜出 [cuan chu - darted out] from a broken house a hundred or so steps from Wang's house. From the faint starlight, you could see that they were tall and sturdy. It seemed that each person was also holding a dark instrument in their hand. A burst of chaotic footsteps stopped in front of a tall gate at the north end. Needless to say, it was Wang the Rich's residence.</p>
<p>That night, Wang the Rich had just returned from the countryside and was lying on the bed smoking and relaxing. He was showing off a roll of banknotes to his wife, who was standing beside him with great interest.</p>
<p>"Look - these brand-new banknotes. Wang Shun and his nephew Wang Da were in a family lawsuit. Today, I actually persuaded them to reconcile willingly, and they each gave me twenty yuan"! Wang the Rich spread out the banknotes one by one with great satisfaction. At the same time, he counted them one by one and said to his wife.</p>
<p>"Of course, without money! Who would be happy to do these irrelevant things? Didn't I ask you to buy a necklace the day before yesterday? You said you would buy it when this money came in. I'm going to wear it out the day after tomorrow"! Wang the Rich's wife made this request to her husband with a half-happy, half-annoyed expression.</p>
<p>"I know! I'll go tomorrow"! Wang the Rich replied solemnly.</p>
<p>As he said this, he finished smoking one cigarette, took a sip of tea, and slowly exhaled a puff of black smoke from his mouth. He was just about to put the second cigarette in his mouth when he suddenly heard a sound. A feeling arose in his dizzy brain: "Is someone coming to talk to me at this time? Yes, that must be it." When he thought of this, he hurriedly shouted: "A Er, go open the door"! A boy of ten years old responded and went. He was about to show his wife how capable he was,</p>

<p>Sister Min, rising late, it's almost noon, seeing the message left by my sister, I know she has gone to school. I went to Xujiahui in the afternoon, and it happened to be a lecture meeting. I asked to see my uncle, but it was cold and uncooperative. Today I met a friend and am temporarily staying at Zhengyi Society, ×hundred×ten× on Lafayette Road.

<p>Below is his own name.</p>
<p>Little Huang held up his lotus root-like arms and was doing the Eight Brocades exercises in the room. When I came back drunk, Chongqing said:</p>
<p>"Little Huang got up before dawn today."</p>
<p>"He's dreaming of women!" I interjected.</p>
<p>Little Huang stopped exercising, looked at me with a silly smile, and after a while, sat down on the edge of my bed and said:</p>
<p>"Who told you?" The expression on his face was exactly like the fat man Hatai on the screen.</p>
<p>"Chongqing, Xiaofeng, slowly interrogate him. My suitcase spent the night in the hotel. I wonder if it's dreaming of women too?"</p>
<p>In a burst of laughter, I sat up.</p>
<p>Twenty-one is not the time for sentimental love.</p>
<p>Take the elevator to the second floor. Met the familiar waiter, he told me; "Miss is still staying in ××."</p>
<p>I suspected and ordered him to open the door, Sister Min was not awake, the ashtray on the table was full of cigarette ashes, chocolate wrappers, melon seed shells were scattered all over the floor, a diary was lying on the sofa next to the bed. I peeked at the records of the last two days, she recorded the situation on my car, recorded our night in the hostel, recorded - when she arrived at school, she saw the announcement published by her uncle in the newspaper. Said that she absconded with the money, considering the brotherhood of the late brother, she would not be held accountable, and from then on, she would break away from the relationship between uncle and niece, etc. I took out the letter I wrote last night, and tore it angrily. Sister Min rushed to Shanghai for me, her uncle published a notice to expel her because of her departure, her reputation was sacrificed for me, I thought blankly, and casually took a cigarette from the jar and fell on the sofa. I thought the temporary and stable life would be declared a failure again. I sucked the unlit cigarette in the corner of my mouth for a long time, and Sister Min was already sitting on the bed laughing.</p>
<p>"Thinking about what will happen sooner or later" - she touched her hair and jumped off the bed like a bird.</p>
<p>"There is nothing to be sorry about," she continued, "do you believe that I came to Shanghai for you! I can't"</p>
<p>Suffering their oppression, they swallowed up my father's inheritance and bullied his remaining weak daughter, brotherhood, what kind of brotherhood! Younger brother..." She cried and threw her whole body into my arms, sobbing. I also forgot myself, forgot　everything, hugged her like I would caress my younger brother when he cried. She suddenly raised her head, containing tears and laughing wildly "Younger brother, don't remember these trivial matters: let's start our new life! How were you yesterday"? Saying that, she jumped up from my arms, spun around on the floor with her toes, dancing on the edge of the bed.</p>
<p>I sympathize with her! This rebellious girl, I despise my own delusions, and tell her in detail about yesterday's situation, and also said about writing the letter in the evening, I asked her to forgive me.</p>
<p>"Hui is in love with you," Sister Min said with a smile.</p>
<p>"Sister, I don't need love, now is not the time for us to be in love! Please protect your younger brother, just like I protect my younger brother."</p>
<p>"Okay! Write a letter to your younger brother, she kissed my face, holding it.</p>
<p>Twenty-two Quadrilateral Love</p>
<p>Returning to Lafayette Road, Gao Fei and others are already in the society, I introduced: to the society members:</p>
<p>"This Miss Sun Min is a progressive woman, please forgive me for breaking the rule of not accepting female society members."</p>
<p>"This time it can be accommodated somewhat," the president replied playfully.</p>
<p>"Little Huang, you can't have chaotic dreams anymore." Chongqing didn't finish, he laughed first.</p>
<p>I narrated the story of the "dream" on behalf of him, and everyone in the room burst into laughter. Sister Min even unintentionally asked, "Is this Mr. Huang?"</p>
<p>Little Huang talked about his wife, and would rather give up the mahjong he regarded as his second life; when he saw a woman, he was so embarrassed that he couldn't speak. His difficult attitude when asked by Sister Min was another round of applause.</p>
<p>These many young people gathered in one place, restored the life in the school era, Little Huang and I are the Laurel and Hardy of Zhengyi Society; however, we hold non-cooperationism, you say I am a love expert, I try my best to tell the story of women. We have been bound for a long time, and now we are like a lark out of a cage. Today Sister Min's entry into the society, Gao Fei already knows our relationship, acquaintance, but does not know the scene in our hotel today. Other young people are also equally smart, and think that Gao Fei's permission for Sister Min to enter the society has a great relationship with me, and when talking, they smile mysteriously where I am involved. Sister Min did not pay attention to some, she inquired roughly about the society.</p>

<h3 id="e339">Famous Failures in Film History (Part 1) <a href="#e339" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c339" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">339</a></h3>
<p>— Translated by Jia Gu</p>
<p>A person with even a slight degree of film observation can usually recognize a successful film. But can we similarly recognize a failed film? Of course, I'm not referring to mediocre productions or clumsy craftsmanship, but to first-class blockbusters whose failure impacts the rise and fall of the entire studio and the success or failure of a major star's career.</p>
<p>A blockbuster is like a bet before its public release. The bigger the bet, the more severe the failure. But what is it that orchestrates success or failure in the shadows? You probably often hear about the production process of a successful film, from the search for a good story to the profit-making. You know who the victorious generals are, how they triumphed, and in what way. However, the history of film failures is no less rich than that of successes. But you rarely hear about who caused those failures, much less how or why they happened.</p>
<p>A major success on the screen invariably creates a major star or a major director, or both. But on the other hand, every failure ruins a person's reputation, shatters a person's future; or, if their reputation is deeply rooted and can withstand the storm, it will inevitably suffer a severe blow, including economic loss and damage to their honor.</p>
<p>The failures on the screen are like figures on a revolving lantern, countless and constantly changing. The comparison of their numbers seems ordained by fate, roughly equal. And the first failure often follows closely on the heels of the first major success. The great director D.W. Griffith made two big films. The one that will be remembered in history forever is *The Birth of a Nation*. But he also made *Intolerance*. The production of that second film cost $350,000, which was not only a huge sum at the time, but is still quite considerable even now. The making of that film was a major artistic gamble for Griffith, because he wanted to combine three different eras of world history into one historical film. As a result, although the film's content was rich and its program varied, it was a thankless task. Audiences were unwilling to jump from Babylon to France in the era of the Huguenots, and then jump again to modern America. It was like throwing a baseball and trying to hit three corners at the same time, but ending up not hitting any of them.</p>
<p>Speaking of the history of failures in the film industry, the strangest thing is that failures are often created by people who shouldn't fail. Their knowledge and experience should have been able to warn them of the path of ruin and prevent them from falling. Of course, the devil is always one step ahead. It takes great talent, great experience, and great capital to qualify for a great failure. Amateur artists and fledgling actors are not likely to go too far astray even if they take the wrong path. So, what is the root of great failure? In a nutshell, it can be said that individual vanity, exaggerated ambition, and the abuse of money are the elements that cause great failure.

<p>Film Reviews</p>
<h3 id="e340">Review of "Christopher Strong" <a href="#e340" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c340" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">340</a></h3>
<p>— Moore</p>
<p>Of course, romances between men and women are the easiest to happen in society and are also the most "dramatic." Therefore, it is not without reason that events of men and women occupy the majority in movies. *Christopher Strong* is also a film with love between men and women as its theme.</p>
<p>Society is very complex and contradictory. Therefore, even in terms of men and women events, there are all kinds of attitudes presented to us. For an artist, dealing with a material is essentially their own understanding and opinion of a certain event. Therefore, even if a film uses the same love story as a theme, what we see is different.</p>
<p>*Christopher Strong* is a story of "two generations of love." The so-called two generations of love here does not show several different ways of love like "three generations of love." It only says that father and daughter both fall into the trap of love and cannot extricate themselves. We don't need to criticize the story itself. Let's see what the author's view on this story is?</p>
<p>"Shixia is already pregnant, deeply regrets her mistakes, and does not want Clay's reputation and happiness to be destroyed with her, so she resolutely soars into the sky and commits suicide by plane."</p>
<p>This is the end of the film, and it is also the author's opinion. The so-called Shixia here is a woman who is in love with a middle-aged man who is married, but they keep it secret, and finally, when it can no longer be hidden, she commits suicide for the sake of her lover's reputation. Behind this, we can see that the producers of *Christopher Strong* believe that it is disgraceful for a married man to be in love with a third party. This point is also confirmed by the fact that young Harry divorced and married young Monica, and this kind of thinking surrounded by traditional concepts is originally shared by a group of old artists. However, in *Christopher Strong*, the author publicly solves it as a problem.</p>
<p>When reading the novels of British writers, I am always amazed by their profound observations. They introduce an ordinary story to the readers in a "microscopic" way, and their method is similar to the anatomy of biologists, objectively to the point of being almost cruel. (Of course, they also have subjective opinions.) Now, the producers of *Christopher Strong* should first observe the truth of this story, think about the meaning of this story, and then emphasize a certain part, simplify a certain part, and express it more truthfully. However, the producers of *Christopher Strong* simply unfold the story in a mediocre way, and the old content makes it impossible to have a new form. What's more, this kind of story should pay attention to psychological analysis, such as the hesitation of a married man when he starts to fall in love with Shixia, and the complex psychology of his wife Jie Lan in preventing her daughter from falling in love with Harry. This conflict between emotion and reason is really the most worthwhile thing to grab in film, but the director of *Christopher Strong* completely abandons it.</p>
<p>The most regrettable thing is that the heroine of this film is originally very good at acting, but under the restrictions of the plot and the director, she has to reduce a lot of achievements.</p>
<h3 id="e341">Review of "I'm No Angel" - Paramount Production, Cathay Premiere - <a href="#e341" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c341" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">341</a></h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>I remember seeing *She Done Him Wrong* at the Guanglu Theater on May 20th this year, and Mae West's name began to leave a deep impression in my mind. Her special style added formal beauty to American films. According to the introduction of American film magazines, she is the most popular person among movie fans after Greta Garbo. Her box office numbers in the United States are even above Garbo, but in terms of money, it is far less than the Swedish Garbo, because the market is sluggish now and seat prices have been reduced.</p>
<p>But what is Mae West's magic? This is of course because she has a talent for acting, but because her dramatic art in this style can have a strong connection with American movie fans, which proves what they need. In a beautiful life, gentlemen are very much hoping to get enchanting temptation from women.</p>
<p>Indeed, she is a talented actress with unique achievements. It is said that her plays are all written by herself, so we have to admit that she is a superior talent.</p>
<p>Speaking of this work, I think the director is the first one who deserves praise. The most successful kind of happy mood fills the entire screen. From beginning to end, it is consistently bright and compact. Under the flexible wrist of director Wesley Ruggles, no small section is not delightful. For example, the court scene is generally difficult to control, because there are too many lines, which can easily make people feel dull, but here, the court scene is still so lively. Of course, most of the achievements should be attributed to Mae West.</p>
<p>Speaking of this, we must touch on the essence of the story. The heroine here is naturally a typical figure in the modern society of the golden country. In order to enjoy herself to the fullest, she does not hesitate to sell her body. She uses her entire body to exchange for a large amount of money from gentlemen. How many gentlemen get from her what they lack and cannot lack at the highest price. Of course, the playwright has great sympathy for the heroine. Although she recklessly falls, she is moved by the so-called true love and unites with the person she loves. Fortunately, the man she loves is not a poor and down-and-out poet, so it still consistently explains that this kind of woman cannot escape the life of jewelry. However, we cannot praise this kind of character, although she is the most reasonable product of society.</p>
<p>At the same time, the playwright uses the heroine's tone to scold the world. She laughs and scolds gentlemen, lawyers, and even dignified judges, who bow to her under her enchantment. I think such joking and scolding is really to the extreme. Just from this point alone, this story is already very commendable.</p>
<p>Several supporting roles are very good, but that Cary Grant makes people feel uncomfortable, at least he is not as pleasing as in *Eagle and the Hawk*.</p>
<p>Editor's note: Regarding this film, this magazine has specially invited Cheng Bugao, Li Fu, and Shen Xiling to conduct detailed research on the screenwriting and directing aspects in order to realize "constructive criticism." A long article will be published soon. Please pay attention to it!</p>
<h3 id="e342">Ye Qiuxin Commits Suicide - In "The Fire of Youth" - <a href="#e342" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c342" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">342</a></h3>
<p>— A Person of Passion</p>
<p>It is said that after Ye Qiuxin disrupted her lover Yu Guang's wedding, she returned and sulked alone in the house. Yu Guang rushed in angrily, and the first sentence was: "Hello, you have ruined everything for me, I want your life!" Ye Qiuxin saw that the situation was not right, so she took out a pistol from the drawer and said to Yu Guang: "Can you forgive me? It's all my fault. But, Yu Guang, you must know that I have always loved you, I have dedicated my whole life and soul to you! What? Do you still hate me? Alas, I'm finished... Well, then I'll die for you!" As she said, she pointed the gun at her head and fired. At this time, Yu Guang was too late to regret. He hurried forward, picked up Ye Qiuxin, and saw Ye Qiuxin in gasping breaths, took out a silk hat from her close-fitting shirt, and said to Yu Guang: "This is your,</p>
<p>your hat, I don't know how many millions of times I have kissed it, now I'll give it back to you!" Yu Guang was stunned. "There's my blood on it, blood shed for love!" Yu Guang was moved to tears. Yu Guang! Don't be sad, listen to my tears, you have forgiven me, sympathized with me, I am very satisfied... Yu Guang: Don't cry, this is the sweetest time of my life, I am very happy!" Ye Qiuxin said intermittently, and those weak eyes stared at Yu Guang's face that was shedding tears, "You... before my breathing stops, please give me a kiss. This is my last request..." In this way, in Yu Guang's arms, in Yu Guang's last kiss, Ye Qiuxin slowly died!</p>
<p>This is the last scene of Qiu Qixiang's "The Fire of Youth". It is really passionate and tense! In fact, this is all the "Fire of Youth" at work! (Yet酬)</p>

<p>After reading the film special of your newspaper on December 3rd, it contained a message about the establishment of the Modern Film Research Association, which was initiated by Dong Xiangping and others. In addition to being an actor in the Star Film Company, I have not participated in any organization. I have not heard of the organization of this Modern Film Research Association. Perhaps the name is the same, and there is someone else. I am afraid of misunderstandings, so I hereby declare that I hope you will publish this letter in the special column. Dong Xiangping respectfully. December 5th.</p>
<h3 id="e344">Film Novel *Little Women* (Part 2) <a href="#e344" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c344" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">344</a></h3>
<p>— Su Yin</p>
<p>The five women, each carrying a box, went out of the March house in single file. In the house across the street, a child was looking out the window. Qiao said: "I think the child in the Lawrence house is pitiful. He came home from Europe from afar, and was locked in an empty house by that old monster who is his grandfather." As she spoke, she couldn't help waving to him. Meg forbade her and said, "Don't do that. People will think you are waving to greet him." Qiao was very stubborn and waved even more vigorously. She thought the child could not see her. But she accidentally looked back and saw that he was also waving. She blushed and rushed ahead with Ya Mei. She thought to herself: "(That child is very cute. I want to get to know him. But Meg's expression is very serious. I will always think of a way..." She had already made up her mind.</p>
<p>The child from the Lawrence house watched the Christmas parade go by from the window upstairs in his own house. He often spied on them from the window. He also knew their names, because he heard them when they called each other. He guessed that Meg was the oldest, probably one or two years older than himself. She was a sweet, kind, and quiet girl, and he knew that she had to walk across the small mountain every day to teach the children of the Jin family in that big house. He hoped that the children of the Jin family would not be as naughty as himself, so that Meg would not be too uncomfortable, because his own teacher, John Brooke, was often bullied by him. Brooke's age was not much older than Meg's. It wasn't that he didn't like Brooke, but he always liked to make fun of him somehow. He thought Qiao was about the same age as him. She was like a boy, and she was probably the most naughty of the sisters. She had to go to her aunt's house every day to be the companion of that old pervert aunt. That was certainly not a good job, so as soon as she returned to her own house, she jumped and was free like a horse without a bridle. But sometimes, she also wrote things in the small room upstairs, frowning as if she was thinking deeply, but I don't know what she was writing. Bess was the shyest, the child from the Lawrence house thought, but she was the sweetest. Everyone in the family looked up to her the most. Sometimes, when Qiao and Ya Mei argued, Bess always acted as a mediator. Ya Mei was still a little sister. She had the longest golden curls, just like a princess in a story. She liked to pretend, liked elegance, and liked to use very long words, he thought of this and smiled.</p>
<p>He was still looking out, not knowing where they were going when they each took something during breakfast. He looked out the window and saw that the things on their table were gone, and he also saw their maid Hannah seem to be wiping her tears, putting a basin of bread and a can of milk on the table. Oh! They must have taken the Christmas breakfast to help the poor! People like them like to do that kind of good deeds!... The March family is very poor, but they can still give some to those who are even less served than them. He thought to himself, wanting to help them too. So he sneaked into his grandfather's study.
