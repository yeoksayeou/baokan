<p>（日内瓦）中國行政院長汪精衛今日在日内瓦發表一文、略謂中國人民當此日人期以武力危害中國之時、不得不根據正誼與公道爲和平利益計、對之　鬭、一旦戰爭發作、其將僅以中日爲限乎、在過去十六月中、中國已在日内瓦謀取和平之解决、一面對於日本之繼續侵略予以抵抗、乃一再延宕、中國朝野不禁大爲失望、李頓報告書已無疑的證明日本侵略之無埋由、及滿洲傀儡國成立之出於僞造、中國雖不盡贊成報告書結論、且以國聯缺乏制止侵略之權能爲憾、然願接受報告晝之一般願則、爲公開坦率的討論之基础、今顯然無疑者日本政策在阻撓延緩並擊敗國聯之行爲、而悍然進行其侵略程序、冀以每個階級中已成之事實佳與世界最高之法庭相抗、而要求現有實際之承認、此即日人所以於上月阻撓調和之後及十九特委會一月十六日集會以前亟事進攻而估據榆關也日本之最後行動、不獨又予中國以必須奮關到底、保其疆士、維謹其國家存在之證據、且爲對於國聯之又一次挑釁、如國聯現仍不作迅速而公道之决定、採行解决争議之有效方法、則直謂和平已成幻萝、而戰争將爲世界和平之惡魔、如中國絶望、而對於日本軍閥作長期之抵抗、則中國所付之代價固大、而全世界所受之影響亦將不堪設想云云、（十二日路透社電）</p>
<p>（柏林）汪精衛昨晨離士平根、衆料其因榆關事雙、雖病未全愈、尅日返華、但現悉汪偕其随員昨晨在吕倫堡過宿、並據旅館經理言、今日乘火車出境、向撓克而去、果爾、則汪之行蹤、殊令人捉摸不定也、（十一日路透社電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）十九特别委員會行將開會、而中國在日内瓦之代表顔惠慶博士願維鈞博士及郭泰褀致電南京政府、促速派兵克恢榆關、此項消息傳出後、衆大驚駭、國聯方面現恐中國希圖克復榆關之舉、將促令戰事嚴重復作、其結果或將爲中日兩國公然開戰、中國代表發言人聲稱、中國恒遵守國聯盟約、而一面則抵禦侵略、榆關明明在中國境内、今圖克復、正如上年春季上海之戰事、絶無攻勢之性質、華人感覺此城必須克復、故準備作絶大之　牲逹此目的云（十二日路透社電）　　（日内瓦）中日雙方代表今皆沉默、人頗異之、且有認此沉默爲大風雨將臨之惡兆者、此間華人方面表示意見、以爲此後之重要發展、或將来自遠東、華人對於國聯之一再延宕、顯呈不耐之象、但就華人已往能度察之、衆料其總可靜待十九特委會會議之結果、此間已悉英人近擬拉攏中日就地解决榆案之謀、業已失敗、（十二日路透社電）</p>

<p>（東京）據日方息、松岡洋右昨日下午六時返内瓦、十時與杉村博士會談約一時二十分、據傳杉村特魯蒙會商已得一新提案、其内容如次、㈠關於「滿洲國」獨立問題、决議案不得提及、保留日後再提議之　、糊塗敷衍一下、以飽日本之慾望、㈡調解委員會聯權不得限定、及時可自由伸縮、以中日英法德意比七國組織如小國反對、則由小國中再選擇一國組織之、以從傍促成解决爲宗旨、㈢美俄參加問題、聽任日本主張、决不提起、㈣中日紛争調停原則、尊重實情、李頓報告晝只能當爲參考、但日外交部對此不加任何之批評、外交界揣測、此案如成立、</p>
<p>則事實與中國主張相差甚遠、雖日本接受、而中日紛争亦不能輕易解决云、（十二日華聯電）</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>最後决心如何元</h3>
<p>自日人迭次侵略以来。我國人已飽受敎訓矣。當其初發動也則必先製造一種口實。曰中國軍隊先開釁也。發動以後。則又曰此係地方事件。中國若稍調動軍隊增兵防守是向日本挑戰也又在平時常號於人曰。中日間事願與中國解决之倘若與之交涉則又必有所藉口。曰中國無交涉誠意也提出抗議。或置不理。或竟爲蠻橫無理之答覆。若我呼訴於國聯。則日人又必昌言曰。</p>
<p>此非第三者所能干涉也。國聯若稍稍頋問。則又必以脱退國聯相恐嚇。或用種種説詞以事延宕。此種計劃。日人預先布置。每一次實力發動。即每一次以此種方法對付中國使我中國於每次被宰割之後。軍隊不敢動一動。國境不敢設一防外交不能展一籌。即國聯亦不能開一口。我苟稍示反抗。則必利用我國人懼戰之心理以相恫喝曰。戰耳戰耳。我若欲避免戰争。隠忍遷延。則彼正好利用此遷延之時間。整理其所佔之土地。布置再進一步之計劃。再来一次地方事件。日人之設計如此試問我中國之地方究有幾何。我隠忍一次。日人即加緊加速度進展一次彼固無時不可製造口實。無地不可製造地方事件也昔人所謂「不到黄河心不死」。日人吞我之野心豈僅黄河而止。以故我若再事隠忍。則全中國釀成地方事件。恐亦即在目前亡國不緩於你死我活之一拚也。</p>
<p>近人論國際間之形勢。每慮太平洋之大戰不遠謂太平洋大戰之時機至。</p>
<p>即我國家危亡之時機至。而大聲警告我一般青年民衆。預謀一整個團結一致工作之計劃。以救我民　族千鈞一髮之危亡。然而前情形觀之。我民族危亡之時機。不必待至將来太平洋大戰之日。而即在今日日軍逐步進逼之時。我全國青年民衆之應急起謀整個團結一致之計劃以救我民族之危亡者亦不能如預備太平洋大戰之從容豫暇而當併日兼程努力奮勇而進。蓋日人已迫我於無路可走。我惟有奮起死搏。以争扎一條出路。</p>
<p>且我奮起死搏亦彼國之所懼也。故彼於每一度侵略之後必稍示以緩和。</p>
<p>非緩和也。一方以和誘怠我國人之心一方暫時鎮静。以觀察我國人之行動。</p>
<p>而定彼進取方針。我不與戰則彼可逐步前進。不犧牲。不勞力。而獲中國全土。</p>
<p>我若奮死與之一戰。則彼緃能勝。緃獲我全土。而犧牲亦必甚大。國力亦必甚疲我不與戰彼佔我土地之後。即可藉爲根據。從容以布置太平洋之大戰。我若奮死與之一戰。則彼旣疲憊於我國之戰役。一旦太平洋戰雲起。必將無力應付，故彼今日利用我懼戰心理而以戰恐嚇我者。正彼自懼戰而以虚聲嚇我以不戰也。我若再延宕因循。投其所便。而避其所懼。或圖一時苟安而輕與言和。則是適中敵人之計。殊非策之善者也。</p>
<p>蓋時勢旣緊張若此。欲從容從根本上謀救國計劃。或另　所以制勝之道。</p>
<p>或委曲以求所以自全之策。或從外交上謀鄰邦之援助。非特不能。亦已有所不及戰固非可輕言。亦非易言。孤注一擲。尤爲國人所同懼。然而熟權利害。審察敵情。决無再容我徘徊觀望之餘地。政府當局。應於速下一最後之决心。</p>
<p>全國人民應於此速定一整個奮鬭之策劃。</p>

<h3>二屆五年計畫蘇俄雷厲風行</h3>
<p>嚴刑峻法對待工人</p>
<p>肅清黨員根絶游民</p>
<p>莫斯科訊、蘇聯五年計畫四年完成之大業、現已竟登峰超極之全功、其全部計畫、雖尚有若干未完成之點、但作爲該計</p>
<p>畫主要眼目之「生產手段之生產」、及重工業之發展、已大體將難關突破、其在工業部分、如煤油·電力·曳引機·及一般機械之開發與製造之成績、均已遠超過當初之預定、疇昔爲一寒村之鳥京萊那及烏拉爾兩地、近已一變而爲最新工業都市矣、至於金屬·運輸·紡織·化學等等部分、則離充實線尚遠、有待於繼績之努力其在農業經濟方面之成績、則在蘇聯全國中、個人農業百分之六十五、已愽向共同農業、且有國營農業人民委員會之設立、但因農村中物資配給之不完備、農民有陸續向都會集中之傾向、而農業生產品亦感不足、此亦有待於未來之努力、</p>
<p>缺勤一日　至於第二次五年計畫之使　　停職處分　命、在將蘇維埃聯邦造成一無階級的社會、使其經濟完全獨立於資本主義諸國之外、當局爲加重二次五年計畫之效率外、最近將勞動規律規定至較前更嚴峻之程度、對於勞動者之怠惰、規定極嚴屬之懲處、勞動者雖僅缺勤一日、但苟無相當理由、立刻予以解職處分、同時並揭出布告、没收其住宅、停止其食糧配給、蓋在以前、人民之麫包領取證、系由各住宅管理者頒發、而此後則改由各工塲與各官署直接發給、如此、則被解雇者當然從尅日起即無麫包可領矣、又勞動者在工作期間遲到五次、即作怠工一日計、故莫斯科街頭搭電車之工人羣、均争先恐後、如發狂然、本年元旦亦不休業、當局且發布嚴戒怠惰之公告、　　竊鈎者處　復次、在農村、當局因鑒於　　槍斃極刑　共同農塲與國營農塲之農作物之頻遭失竊、茲已發布嚴令、以後如有犯者、處槍斃之極刑、曾有人盗竊馬鈴　七袋、發覺後即被處死刑、</p>
<p>本年厲行　又當局對於共產黨員、最　二次清黨　近曾施行突破二百萬人數之大掃除、並期於今年（一九三三）再厲行俄羅斯共產黨結成以來第二次之大清算、且决定本年一年間停止徴收新黨員、</p>
<p>無業游民　又此項掃除運動、並不限　　逐出都市　於黨員、其對待一般人民亦然、去年十二月二十八日頒布一法令、以莫斯科爲首、開始各大都市之一般市民之大洗滌運動、凡無一定職業之非社會分子、及不勞而食之寄生蟲、悉數逐出都市、其實施方法、在全俄羅斯境内施行軍一旅劵制、凡未經職業登記而無旅劵者、無居住都市之資格、當局即迫使入農村工作、又無旅劵者亦不許入都市、此法一行、可以防大批農民之都會集中、調節人口過剩、澈底絶滅非社會分子、</p>

<h3>外强中乾的日本（東京通信）</h3>
<p>能維持生活的祗有貴族和資本家</p>
<p>暫時的景氣是不兑換紙幣的把戲</p>
<p>大兵赴滿是軍閥</p>
<p>轉移目光的手法</p>
<p>物價向上漲了、繁榮的市面就在眼前、這是去年歳末、島國裏到處所歌頌的、不錯、物價碓實是高漲、有的物品、例如生絲、</p>
<p>竟漲起一倍有奇、砂糖·棉紗·木材、漲起一倍半、鋼鐵和銅、也漲一倍多、總之五十六種物品之中、只有七種稍微低落、其他各種物品的市價、都一致向上飛騰、表現着日本市面的好轉‘然則他國裏的人、</p>
<p>何以依舊呻吟於「不景氣」之下、中流以下的人家、早已是朝不保夕、飽一頓餓一頓的挨下去、對將來的希望、只好付諸渺茫的命運、讓荒木一派白亮得似水銀一般的軍閥、去用「五行」「陰陽」「干支」配備、説今年（一九三三年）是大成功的一年、</p>
<p>試舉一個恐慌深刻的例、京都帝大的敎授、總算是知識界當中翹楚、河上肇博士、尤其是現今日本經濟學界中的威權者、同時是研究馬克司學説的第一流學者、他的作品一出版、真有洛陽紙貴之槪、在京都帝國大學經濟系任敎、尤其聲名赫赫、却因爲右傾運動抬頭、河上博士乃被迫辭去敎職、出了研究室、進到實際社會、他曾經加入勞農黨、主張過非台法運動、引起多數日本青年的同情、自從九一八事變發生、軍刀指揮一切、匪特左翼運動受着嚴酷的壓迫、即資本主義的自由主義者、如果公然主張「民主政治、　」也難免殺身之禍、就是從前所曾允許的「研究自由、」也完全被武力剥脱、所以河上博士遂不爲軍部及軍部所指揮的各種右傾團體所容、去年五月而後、説是出外旅行、</p>
<p>但就此失踨、有人説他秘密赴俄、有人説是已經不在人間了、可是照尋常的情形、</p>
<p>河上氏一家還可靠他的著作版税過活、</p>
<p>究竟是不能支持、河上氏第二女連升學費也没有、只好請託他的朋友介紹給人家作打字生、勉强度着窮苦日子、中等以上的人家尚且如此、則能維持水平綫以上生活的人、只有貴族和資本家了、</p>
<p>然則他的毛病、到底在那裏呢、日本自前年十二月脱離金本位後、去年上半年、其對外匯兑、雖然低落、却還不至於十分影響到日常生活、一般物價還往下低落、對輸出貿易的剌激、也不甚多、所以上半期的輸出貿易、只有五萬四千元日金、比前年同時期减少二千萬元日金、可是七月以後至十二月底商品輸出、計八萬五千萬元日金、比之前年同時期增加了二萬九千萬日金、這種表面上繁榮的情况、可説是世界無匹了、但是去年夏季而後、他的正貨準備、日漸减少、到年底日本的現金、恐怕最多不過值四萬二千萬元日金、所以在國際匯兑上日本貨幣信用低落、對美匯率從平時價值日金日元合美金四十九元五角、去年十一月竟跌至二十美金、據最近情勢觀察、恐怕會要有跌破二十美金之　、於是乎我們知道現時日本的景氣、是一種不兑換紙幣作出來的把戲、因爲貨幣價值越低、則物價相形之下、就會越高、對外匯兑如果跌落百分之六十、則物價也會漲起百分之六十、物價雖然漲商、而日幣信作却受了重傷、何况日本銀行所發行的兑換劵、去年年底已增加到十五萬萬日金、今年開市纔趕緊用　債證劵換回一萬萬多去、以免紙幣過多、惹起整個國民經濟的搖動、</p>
<p>殊不知日本軍閥早就準備好了、要進一步用軍力解决一切、乘第二師團交代之便、調動第六師團　滿洲去、據某方面特殊情報、集結在錦州绥中山海關朝陽寺北票一带的日本軍、計有原來駐在錦州的第八師團全部、新從熊本調到的第六師團全部、還有從上海轉到滿洲去的第十四師團全部、以及騎兵第二旅團的一部分、紛集榆關及熱河邊境、準備進攻熱河和　東五縣、所以他提出山海關以西至　州爲中立地带的條件、這是日本軍國主義的常套手法、對外開拓土地、對内剌激人心、移轉他國内人民注視經濟恐慌的目光、不知道祖國　胞和當局、是否窺破他這種把戲、立即起來和他幹、（一九三三·一·六日於東京）</p>

<h3>蘇炳文軍撤退後之中東路</h3>
<p>沿線貼有日本占領標語</p>
<p>海拉爾車站由蒙兵防護</p>
<p>字林西報十二月二二十三日哈爾濱通訊云、中東路自哈爾濱至西境滿洲里一段、現已通車、旅客得以通行其間、一覩地方情形、探詢蘇炳文部隊迅速退走原因、此次日軍定必自四洮洮昻兩鐵路運輸大軍北上無疑、迨其全部悉已開至富拉爾基附近陣線、乃向華軍猛攻、迫中國軍隊向後撤退、據記者在紮蘭屯所聞、日軍曾向駐在紮蘭屯山巔之華軍、兩面同時夾攻、砲火連續不停、繼以飛機抛擲炸彈、按紮蘭屯爲北滿名區、位於山間、乃與安嶺門户、華軍旣不勝砲火之壓迫、遂委棄全部輜重而走、於是日軍乘勝急進、且以日軍緊追異常迅速、幾使華軍無復有毁斷鐵路之機會、即令華軍誠在與安嶺隧道埋置地雷、亦因退走怱促、未及燃着引線、當時中國軍隊旣迅向俄邊退却、遂令日軍得以長驅急進、自過紮蘭屯後、不復遇有抵抗焉、目下行旅自哈爾濱西行、過安逹以西、即有一奇異現象、映入眼簾、凡沿鐵路電線木上、無一不貼有紙片、上印旭日旗、下標日文「日本占領」字樣、再沿途未見一「滿洲國」旗幟、亦絶無絲毫徴象、</p>
<p>足以表示日軍此舉係代「滿洲國」肅清路線者、但據紮蘭屯某俄人言、當日軍初次進攻富拉爾基與呼爾哈拉之中國軍隊時、日方受創極巨、死傷不下千人、此語或者真確可信、因纔於十日前、有一日輪、載日兵火葬骨灰三百二十四箱運抵神户、此輩日兵、自必在北滿戰塲所死無疑、迨記者抵海拉爾、則見車站已由蒙兵防護、此軰蒙兵、亦係受僱於「滿洲國」者、</p>
<p>據其統兵官言、目下護路軍全由蒙人與布利亞人編成、（按布利亞人爲貝加爾湖附近之蒙古族）無一漢人、因日人對於漢人、已絶對不信任也、海拉爾鎭未蒙損害、商務似尚能維持常狀、惟糧食奇缺、貴若珠玉、全羊一只、須以哈大洋四元相易、肉價每磅哈大洋一角二分、記者在海拉爾聞有日兵一隊、備齊度冬服装、自該地開出、諒向蒙邊而去、不知其目的安在該鎭有日商數人、自稱在蘇炳文退走前一星期、曾親見馬占山與之談話、彼等前在龍江省城、常見馬占山、深識其人、</p>
<p>在海拉爾所見者、確係馬氏無疑、據稱馬占山於離海拉爾時、曾謂將在北平向張學良請撥飛機、希望於一個月再回海拉爾、目下自哈爾濱至滿洲里間、沿路已安靖無事、因北蘇俄當道、現擬將西伯利亞快車復開至滿洲里、預定莫斯科通車、於二十六日第一次到滿洲里、歐洲郵件、刻正由赤塔站轉運東來、滿境與歐洲之交通、閉而復啓、將來哈爾濱「滿洲國」郵局、或能對於職務上應有工作、應付裕如、目下則其局員猶缺乏充分經騐也、至中東路方面、俄理事與「滿洲國」理事、近來幾逐日開會討讑各問題、逆料攻歲後、當有許多改革云、</p>
<h3>張學良招待新聞界談話</h3>
<p>國際間和平運動已歸泡影</p>
<p>惟以精神與赤血保護祖國</p>
<p>北平通信、軍分會委員長張學良、爲榆關事件、八日晨十時半、在私阺招待北平中外新聞界、到六十餘人、由李應超任英文傅繹、陳亞牧任法文傅繹、茲將張氏談話、詳誌如次、</p>
<p>「今日約請諸位＼就諸位所詢各點、　以本人感想、綜合一談、自九一八事變以來、余常思慮究以和平了結、抑使事態擴大、經思慮結果、决以合理的和平方法了結、蓋和平解决、不獨中日兩國、即全世界亦蒙福利、亦不僅余一人作此想、即中央政府各要人、亦皆抱此委曲求全之心也、</p>
<p>同時余又想到、假使事態擴大、致兩國不得已而以干戈相見、此非僅中日兩國間之不幸、即歐戰以後所得國際間之和平保障、亦必爲之打破、其影響實　重且大也、余更相信此種和平觀念、不但中國人　之、即日本一般目光遠大之政治家、亦率多抱此觀念、故　國内頗有反對日本的暴烈行爲、而進行和平運動、如日本政治家尾　行雄氏所著之　讑、可代表一斑、而類此抱有和平思想之日本國人正多、伹不幸終爲一般暴烈份子所犧牲、大政治家、有名人物、已有數有矣、乃自事變以迄今日、中國之和平願望、日本人受護和平者之願望、以及國際間之和平運動、均歸泡影、而日方則每於擴大事態之後、反自詡彼酷愛和平者、而和平之　壞、其責任在華方、庸知前後事實、固彰彰可證也、茲再一談近日之事實、此次山海關事件發生、日方曾指　中國方面調動軍隊、試問彼國軍隊可以在他人國境内自由行動、强橫無忌、而反指摘他國軍隊在　自已國境之行動、寗有是理、且中國之調動軍隊、純爲防止他人之擴大侵略、豈此種自衛權、而亦應爲人削奪耶、</p>
<p>日前有某日人以中國何故調動軍隊詢余、余即據此率直答之、又設一警喻、如有人覺其環境不安、而雇人保護、或閉户以防衛、乃有謀不利於彼者、反謂不應保護、不應閉户防衛、豈非無理取閙歟、余又回憶一事、當國聯調查團出　返平、過榆關時、日方忽於該專車經過之一暼間、</p>
<p>在車站高懸日旗及僞國旗、同車之中外人士、睹此大爲驚異、我　車衛隊、於憤激之下、有欲奔往拔去者、當時調查團某要人阻止之、并謂此舉爲余目睹、知日方對於榆關固随時有挑釁之心也云云、是日人蓄意如何、早爲人所察知、今日方於侵佔榆關之　、反製造事因、誣謂我軍挑戰、其誰信之、余因山海關事件、而連　感及中國所受各種條約之束縛、彼日方對於有利於彼之事、輙力援條約爲彼護符、即廢約亦可引用、無利於彼者、則悍然抺殺、即如此次榆變、即因日可駐軍而發生、總之、日方儘可片面的援用條約資彼有利、而我方則深蒙其損害矣、榆關事件發生之初、日方歸各我方抛擲炸彈、</p>
<p>以致開釁、究誰擲此炸彈、姑先置諸不問、試問以擲一炸彈之微、而即應大舉攻陷人城池乎、此種無理藉口、故意擴大狀態之行動、與九一八柳條溝事件、如出一轍、以此例彼、當可恍然擲此彈者究爲伊誰矣、有人問余、榆關事件、究屬誰先挑釁、及如何了結、余笑謂果欲根究、再由國聯派一調查團來調查、至於如何了結、</p>
<p>則其權完＝全操諸佔人城池者之手、簡言之、榆關問題、與東三省問題相同、彼如何奪去者、應即如何歸還是也、日人曾在國聯倡言東三省緃可歸還中國亦决不肯歸還張學良、張學良必不准其他中國軍隊入東三省、是日方關於侵略中國者、完全以余一人爲對象、以舉國之力侵略中國、亦即不啻以舉國之力、加余一人、其意若以爲中國對日一切事端、皆爲余一人所造成、故銜恨也至深、誠如是、則余不幾成爲中國歴史上之唯一大人物、然而余固不敢承也、要知張學良不過爲中國軍人之一份子、爲國家服務之一份子、</p>
<p>愛國一如中國人之一份子、試問張學良何能不許其他中國軍隊入東三省、日人又當謂「滿洲國」之不能取消、係日方之面子關係、要知中國土地、被人侵害、國家及人民生命亦不能保、以面子與生命相較、果孰輕重、今我國委曲求全、旣無效、全世界盡力和平亦無效、到今日惟有以吾人之精神與赤血以保護我祖國、以維持正義而已、余更度及不數日後、日方必將謂中日問題不能和平解决、係張某作梗、或謂中國已决心作戰者、但彼寗未想及中國人此種决心、果爲誰逼成者、倘日方果真愛和平、則和平立可實現、中國人蓋完全居於被動者之地位也、或問余日軍亂華、其意究欲何爲、余對此問題、</p>
<p>實難解答、余以爲凡人每作一事、必先謀其有利、試問日軍自佔東三省以來、果獲何利益否、假使日方以一切怨尤加余一人之身、必欲去余以爲快、其實余爲國人中之一弱者、精强於余者、何止萬千、使余果去、則繼余而來者、必强於余、須知日人所索者爲我人之血、不獨余不能給予、即任易何人亦必不能給予、今日方叢怨於余、殆已遺忘抗日爲中國全民衆之共同責任矣、適在座者有外國友人問及、</p>
<p>保護中國、係中國政府及中國人民之職責、但我人有何可帮忙之處、余曾記有日友某、自日本來華、詢余曰、余等在國内祇聞華方多無理行動、故日政府一再對華用兵、及至來華、目撀者何大反　等語、從可知日本國内人民、完全昧於日軍侵華之真相、純係爲一般暴烈份子所朦蔽、即昐友邦記者常以中日事件以來之真實消息、公布於世界及日本國内、俾該國人民、不致永爲彼暴烈份子所麻醉、而翻然覺悟侵華之非、同時余更希望諸君對於宣傅中日事件、完全説實話、蓋與論即爲維持正義之第一利器、果能發揮與論之精神、余偕正義必有伸張之一日也」、至是談話畢、有某外國記者詢以中國之軍事行動若何、張答、已過去者、諸君當已明瞭、未來者、恕難奉告、又詢以中國是否决定抵抗、張答以中國抵抗與否、</p>
<p>權在日方、蓋須視其是否侵略爲斷也、（九日）</p>
<h3>關外農民紛紛返籍</h3>
<p>日閥摧殘不得寗處</p>
<p>連日過青逾三萬人</p>
<p>青島通訊、魯省因人口過剩、每年往東三省謀生者、以數十萬計、自九一八事變發生後、備受日閥蹂躏摧殘、多裏足不敢前往、即原在東省之商民、亦因時遭日人屠殺、不得寗處、相率扶老携幼轉回故鄉、是以連日來、由東北過青回籍之農民、異常衆多、凡由大連進口之輪船、均告人滿、此項農民、除一部份同小港登輪船赴石臼所海州等處外、其　多半乘膠路車西上、膠路當局爲體卹起見、特掛小工車一列、减半收費專供由東三省回籍者乘用、規定每晚八時半、由青島開車西上、但在往因人數　多、所掛車輛不能容納、不得上車者、只得在車站鵠候、待次日再行、膠路因小工車不敷使用、特飭四六機廠將存於該廠之三等客車趕緊修理、以備應用、聞此項車輛、</p>

<p>是鄭之敢於舞弊、一欵兩支、開司法界之惡例、</p>
<p>楊肇熉爲之徇隱、豈　辭帮助之嫌、此應彈劾者一　代有無虧空、當以銀行存欵數目與　代册列存欵數目是否上相符爲斷、友唐一再函調楊鄭與銀行往來薄、始則現任地方法院院長沈秉謙、</p>

<h3>十年後（一）</h3>
<p>— 及</p>
<p>眼前是一座高樓大厦，　　　設得準　垂</p>
<p>富麗。我走了進去，在一間　　門　底房間前站住了。我知道這迎見新　的　房，撩開了門幕［托！托！］用手指彈了房門。</p>
<p>［誰？］是裏邊橋脆的聲音。</p>
<p>［我。一個你先前認識過的人。］</p>
<p>門開了。</p>
<p>迎見著着玄色緞子的皮襖和裙子，裙子一直長到脚背是一個十足的少婦的樣子了。她見了我一嚇。步兒退，退，退到床邊。我在這房間中打量了一下：　着花兒的牌幃，柔軟發光的帳幕，簇新的床舖和桌椅·····一切富麗的陳設，使我底眼也花了。一股幽香撲入我底鼻空。我纔注意到那床上底色彩色調和的摺疊着的棉被。</p>
<p>［你······那裏來的？我不認識你！］突然地，她說了這一句，　異的眼光直釘住我底臉。</p>
<p>「你别這樣說，姑娘！我就是你年前呌過（哥哥）的人哪。</p>
<p>「哥哥？哥哥就是你？」她尖聲地問。隨卽把雙　手舉起來掩住了自已底臉頰。</p>
<p>［是的，就是我。］</p>
<p>［請你把眼鏡除掉！］她懷欵着。</p>
<p>我迅速地除掉了鼻樑上底眼鏡。</p>
<p>［阿呀！］她坐下床沿，急　地撩開幪帳門遮住了自已　　　。但卽刻又放開了，［你不　該到我們房裏來····］</p>
<p>［（休們！）（休們）是誰？我不知道。我只　　你一個！］</p>
<p>是的，你不　　的·我已　於一個你所不　　的男人了。］</p>
<p>［所以你看我不起，不認議我了？］</p>
<p>［也······許·····］她遲疑了，但忽然話語轉念了：［完全不是這檏，賭你知道我底苦裏，第一，我你十年不見了；第二，我來此，完全不是自已的主意。·····］</p>
<p>［請不要誤解吧！今天我找到了你並没歹意在心；只是要問你一聲：你底心中究竟還有没有十年前你呌過（哥哥）的那人了？請你答覆這一點，給站在你面前底一個孤獨的　魂一處歸宿！］</p>
<p>］你在逼我死！［她忽然鳴咽了，［你簡直在逼我去死！］</p>
<p>［哭了？誰怕你！女人專玩這把戲的！］我頭頂冒出炎星來了。</p>
<p>「把戲？諎在逼迫我？」</p>
<p>女人們這套把戲眞有効，我畢竟用手帕去栻她底眼涙了。</p>
<p>「姑娘！請你了解我，我没力量逼你死。你不要使一個天涯海角　流了十年底人難堪！請你捒選一條踀路給他走：消沉的，堕落的；還是奮發的鬥爭的？」</p>
<p>」你已奮鬥了十年，難道今後走的路還要一個能的女子來給你决定嗎？」她底神情，是一個天眞的妹妹向着哥哥疑問。「（未完）</p>
<h3>「不忍池」與「莫愁湖」</h3>
<p>— 楊幸之</p>
<p>日本東京有一個池，呌做「不忍池」：在我們南京則有一個湖，呌做［莫愁湖］。我們每一想到這不忍池與莫愁湖，便很容易聯想到中日兩國民族性的差異點。</p>
<p>因爲［不忍］，所以他們時時在奮鬭，時時在抗爭，時時在以自力爭奪前途的勝利。一八五三年美國幾條黑船闖開了他們底緊閉着的門户，並威逼他們訂立了不平等條約，他們便奮起維新，不六十年，終於擠上了帝國主義者的寳座，而成爲今日雄踞東亞虎視全球的惡覇。一九二三年大地震，繁榮的東京，被震得幾於完全成爲一片瓦礫，他們便奮起與大自然抗爭，從瓦礫的堆中重新建造出一個繁榮的東京，到現在，東京是比一九二三年時更爲繁榮了。</p>
<p>這便是日晒底「不忍」的民族性，也就是不忍民族性所睡穫的美滿的果實。</p>
<p>因爲［莫愁］，所以我們便長年是遷延苟安，得一天過一天，滿不在乎地生活着。小之明天没有飯吃也可以不管，大之明天會亡國也可以不問，一切聽從環境支配。人家要瀋陽，我便退到錦州，人家要錦州，我便退到山海關，近百年來，我們便長是這様滿不在乎地在人家的鞭子下過着，而且還要跳舞，還要娛樂，····「商女不知亡國恨，隔江猶唱後庭花」，便是「莫愁」民族性的最切實的禮讚。到了今日，，終於造成了所謂國難。這惡果的收穫，自然也正是由於］莫愁］民族性種下的惡因。</p>
<p>有人說，「不忍」是褊急，狹隘，要［莫愁］纔穢算是泱泱大國的風度。但我們現在已經臨到再不能不愁的境地了，也應該振作起精神來奮鬭一次罷！</p>
<h3>女人們的第三重桎梏</h3>
<p>— 吳澤炎</p>
<p>倍倍爾在他的名著［婦人與社會］的叙言中說，現代［婦人實在負着二重桎梏。第一因爲婦人對於男子的社會從屬的結果，非呻吟於劣等的社會地位不可。法律上的形式平等，祇能緩和他們的痛苦，而不是根本的辦法。第二是婦人受着經濟從屬的苦痛。這是婦人一殷的狀態，和無產者的男子同樣，是無產階級共通的運命。［現在，我們又發現了婦人的［第三種桎梏一，那便是她們的衣飾。</p>
<p>［衣飾］，與其說是自已愛美，母寧說是爲了取悅他人。在禽獸的求偶期間，大抵都具有美麗的羽光澤的毛，以引旅誘其對手。至於人類，在最初，男女婚姻關係是由女性選擇男性時，裝飾的不是女性而是男性，但自從父權代替了母權，掠奪婚姻盛行以後，男子便征服了婦人。不特婚姻選擇的權利在男子，婦人且不得不在男子的愛憐下過寄生的生活。在這種情形之下，婦人活動的範圍，就自然的受了極端的限制。爲减免生活　單調和取悅於她底丈夫起見，她便專心一意地集中精力於裝飾。她裝飾得俞美麗，她愈可以抓握住她男子的心。把人生的活動都集中裝飾的這一重桎梏，鎭壓住了幾千年來婦人底智力的進步。</p>
<p>尤其在有閒階級中，爲丈夫或父親者往往意識地去敼勵他們的妻女去講究衣飾，用以誇耀自已的闊氣和艶福。使婦人喪失盡了對於時間的觀念，對於人生向上的信心與自種心。於是［傀儡家庭］中的一個嬌滴地的太太或小姐便造成了。</p>
<p>太太小姐們，花一兩］點鐘去搽粉或鹽一次頭髮，是再稀鬆平常不過的一件事。有那一回，三個女人見面時不說起時裝式樣，衣裳的尺寸？</p>
<p>所以，目前我們與其談婦女運動的高調，母寧先將女人們從不自尊重的衣飾中拖出來。</p>
<h3>蘇聯的服裝</h3>
<p>— 李梨</p>
<p>假使你住在蘇聯，那末，巴黎的太太小姐們，穿的是些什魔衣服？她們的頭髮是怎樣梳的？她們用的那一種香水？拍的那種粉？等等的問題，將永永不會有人在你面前提及。</p>
<p>海外奇談錄　第五頁　中國福新煙公司編還</p>
<p>在蘇聯，你可以穿所有的任何服裝，各人都是這樣。那裏没有所謂［時季裝］，只兩洋種服裝：熱天的和冷天的。</p>
<p>無論在蘇聯的什麽地方，就是在莫期科大戲院裏，也是看不見服裝華麗的婦女，看不見耀光的珠寳，看不見長曳的晚禮服。但他们和她們，每個人都是活潑愉快的，都穿着輕便而清漯的外衣。</p>
<p>在蘇聯，也没有［時裝雜誌］，報紙上也没有討論服裝的文字，更没有那一個店舖，拿衣服來做廣告。無線電播音，也從來不講至關於服裝和修飾一類的問題。</p>
<p>而且，假使你住在蘇聯，那末，你或許一直到現在，還没有穿過絲襪。在蘇聯，十分之八九的婦女，總是穿着質料單薄的棉線襪，平常的顏色，總是淡灰色，土色，白色，或是黑色。假使一個婦人整天專門研究服裝和修飾，那大家一定當她是一個不自尊重的玩物。</p>
<p>至於蘇聯男子的服裝，如像輕便外衣，是一種有趣的服裝。那直立的領綠上，常常飾着人工的剌繡，鈕扣總是繼在左邊的；許多男子；總是穿着這種衣服，頭上戴着一頂國家工廠製造的便帽。</p>
<h3>空氣推進汽車</h3>
<p>— 洪興熾</p>
<p>在美國弟曲落以脱密區地方試騐過］</p>
<p>，我們要爬上很滑的冰山，祇有用一種靈巧的空氣推進汽車。這種車有四張葉子，好像飛機的曳引葉，用一百匹馬力的引敬擎動，車底上裝着輪子·車身一百三十二寸闊，一千五百磅重·這新奇的汽車每小時能走八直哩，一加侖燃料可以走三十哩。</p>
<p>因爲輪子並不推動車身，可以自由轉動，不必像普通的汽車牢着地面，所以，這種空氣推進汽車能在污泥的地上或斜滑的山上和平地一般的駕馳。如果馳走在極快的時候，車的前部向上傾斜，那葉子發出來的急風，能把牠壓下。葉子的四周有鋼絲網圍住，防免意外。</p>
<p>據發明者報告試騐結果，五英尺葉子的空氣推進車，載六個或八個人，比平常用輪子推動的汽車快四倍。一駕乘三個人的模範車，現正在設計製造中，預料一加侖汽油可以走四十哩，最高速度一分鐘可馳二哩，並不會有傾跌的危險。</p>

<h3>時代與愛的歧路（續稿）</h3>
<p>— 張資平</p>
<p>鶴子夫人看見這本雜誌的封面，一點美觀也没有，只是紅得厲害。也再翻了翻内容，也没有幾篇是文藝的作品，大部分是理論的文章。她學没興趣，便把那本雜誌擱回去了。　　她又走到海泉的床邊來，留戀着不忍就走。在電光之下，海泉的臉色雖然是蒼白了一點，但是他的那種强烈的青年男性美，對於她似乎有一種誘惑。同時，想像到在他的週身血管中的純潔的高熱的血液，她的胸口也不可思議地急激地跳躍起來了。</p>
<p>她愈注視這個在熟睡中的青年，愈覺得他有一種魅力。有幾次她幾乎失掉了她的自制力，想自發地鑽進他的被　裏去，把他緊緊的抱着。</p>
<p>［萬］他醒轉過拒斥自已時，那多難爲情啊！］</p>
<p>想到這點，又像有一陣冷水澆在她的背上，全身起了一陣戰慄，她忙自制着。</p>
<p>［還是正當地高聲嚮氣地呌他醒來，看他的意思怎樣。］</p>
<p>她剛想實行她的這個計劃，但一回想到他的脾氣，又有點失望。因爲這個正當的計劃實施後，結果是意料得到的，卽是他一醒轉來看見自忆立在他的床前，他一定唐突地問，［你來吵人家做什麽？］</p>
<p>這樣的無藝術無表情的科學式的質問會給女性以難堪的。這個未來的理學士每說起話來，一點不客氣，一點不會加以修詞的潤色。</p>
<p>但那種青春的新鮮血液的想像，仍然是對她作一對誘惑。她第一因爲丈夫離開了她將近三星期之久了，在生理上她早想早捕住這個未來的理學士做她的俘虜。第二因她明知丈夫的南行完全是爲另一個女性，丨可以說是她的敵人，丨這會促進她的娥妬的報復。她站着思想了一忽，在尋覓可以爲她的今晚上的脱軌的行動作辯護的理由。但她無論怎樣，都不能否定她自身之爱着低級的本能所騙使。</p>
<p>［這個表青年的態度眞是呌我無法對付·····近幾天來，他對自已完全是誤解。呌他醒來，向他解釋一個明白吧。［她看着海泉的睡顏在想。她看見他臉上表現着種崇高的魅力。快達到中年的她，在性愛生活上雖有了豐富的體騐的，但從未獲得一番滿足的戀愛的她，對於這青年眞有說不出來的熱愛丨一有機會，便會汜濫起來的熱情。自　識他以來，有三個月以上的期間了。他的不卽不離的態度只有使她一天一天的增加煩悶，也會妨害她向他表不她的滿腔情熱的機會。</p>
<p>恰好是這瞬間，她看見他的尊　的蒼白的臉上起了一陣柔笑。她嚇了一跳，以爲他是醒轉過來了。但是，只一刻他臉上的柔笑又消失了。她才知道他是在愉快的夢中。</p>
<p>她此刻又發見了一個異跡，在他的枕畔，有一封漢紅色的信封。好奇心，丨否，其實是一種　妬心逼着她伸逼手去檢過來看。</p>
<p>「煩大姊轉交林海泉君手收，妹偑珠拜託。」</p>
<p>鶴子夫人知道這是誰給他的信了，同時感着一陳的醋意。她想抽出内容來看了。</p>
<p>」不行！這是不道德的行爲！給他知道了時，會給他看不起的。不要學支那人所特人有的，專侵犯他人的自由及權利的行爲吧！「</p>
<p>她想着，忙把那封信擱回他的枕畔去了。同時，她微吁了一口氣。</p>
<p>「無論如何，我不能放過他哟！」</p>

<h3>匪寇婚媾</h3>
<p>— 瞻廬</p>
<p>易經是一部奇妙的事，這[匪寇婚媾］四個字，下得尤其奇妙；奇妙在那裏？奇妙在本年一月二日香港深水埠地方發生一件刼案，差不多替［匪寇婚媾四字做在脚·</p>
<p>容記臘肉店老板在門前焚香點燭燒着多量的冥强，喃喃地在祝告：</p>
<p>［朋友呀！不是我强估你的婦妻呀！是伊受着生活問題的壓迫才來嫁給我的呀！我在洞房花燭之先，賠你一大份冥强，請你自夫受用，不要在這裏糾强！］</p>
<p>半百年紀的老板謝華娶一個二十八歲的再醮婦張妹爲妻，商人迷信未破，防着伊的前去來作黨　，他不急於圓他的好夢，而念於結佨的鬼緣；直待祝告完畢，方才關閉户，回到洞房中夫實行新婿者的重要工作·</p>
<p>誰料，蓬蓬的敲門聲敲破了他們的好夢！謝華披衣起問，外面只是一片聲的［快快開門！］</p>
<p>這時，滃起着謝老板的滿腹疑雲，恰才燒强完畢，便有這奇異的敲門聲，是人？是鬼？成了一個問題，正似西廂記上說的：［是人啊，快說；是鬼</p>
<p>啊，速滅·］</p>
<p>來買臘肉的呀！］門餐　股說·</p>
<p>臘肉兩字，便購開了兩扇大門，重利的謝華以爲主顧來了·哼！主顧眞好！一擁而人的便是三條漢，不買臘肉，而把謝華常做臘肉般的用繩　着，没有穿衣的新娘躱在被窩裏不做聲，被他們翻箱倒箧，把那價値數百元的金珠飾物都刼去了，方才　　而去！</p>
<p>事後，張妹下床，把這緊緊　信的臘肉！伊丈夫釋放了，開列失單，報告深水埠警署連夜捕捉匪人，但是捉一個空；警署因此妹妹未被三匪綁縳，有相當的嫌疑，便卽把伊扣住嚴究，現在還没有［水落石出·］</p>
<p>試把［匪冠婚媾四字逐一的解釋，［匪］是賊匪，［婚］是結婚人，［寇］字［媾］字，都作動詞用，那麽，這四字實在是謝老板一幅行樂圖上的絶妙題詞。</p>
<h3>雁的悲哀</h3>
<p>— 紅玉樹</p>
<p>丨哭笑不得丨</p>
<p>翹馬長空，由東北解飛來的一字長蛇的雁陣，不由的使人幻生一種特殊印象。羡慕它那樣餐風飲露的毅力；和偉大團結的精神，［雁］總說得上好似一個孤高而多愁善哭的救國志士哩！　　據說雁的確是個最愛同羣的一種飛鳥，果然有個雁離了團結的陣線；或落了伍，就會悲鳴不斷，絶食而待斃，以這一層和那班具大知識的軍人；動不動因爲細故就演成鬩牆相爭同類相殘的慘劇，雙方對照起來，眞可謂人不如鳥了。　　再聽到它如泣如訴的聲浪，因爲他們是寄身邊圉，曾從傀儡國中經過，它的航空線，也許與暴日的鐵鳥（飛機）接蟹過一次，度過亡國生活，憑空瞭望着東北失地人羣活活的受鐵蹄的蹂躏，衹憑着孤軍寡援的義勇軍，掙扎着與强寇周旋，所以不忍坐視淪亡，毅然的整隊人關，像杜鵑啼血般呌號好似銜有義軍的使命，來向國人乞援一樣。但是悲酸的聲調，不知果能吹到唱着救國高調的大人先生們的耳朶裏嗎？俗說［雁］入關則笑；出關則哭，現在它眞是哭笑不得了。（却酬）</p>
<h3>都市散記</h3>
<p>— 郭蘭馨</p>
<p>丨這是甚麽現象？丨</p>
<p>我在馬路上隨着萬人如海的潮流中走着。</p>
<p>賣報人手裏的報紙，印着觸眼的大字，賣報人嘴裏喊着華北吃緊山海關失守的消息。</p>
<p>馬路上的人，女人大都花枝招展，白的粉　鬆的頭髮，紅的嘴唇，活的眼睛，長旗袍，高跟鞋，皮大衣，男的在後面像勤務兵樣追隨，誰也没有對于賣報人嘴裏喊的消息留意，好像對于在路上喊呌貨的一樣。</p>
<p>到了影戲院門前，看見摩登歌舞，肉香血溢，上下客滿。廣告牌，有許多人在買下次的門票。</p>
<p>酒家有酒醉飯飽的歡呼從臨街的窗裏飄越出來。酒家的門口，有三個鳩形鵠醒了，剛一翻身準備起來，聽衎室中樓板上有幾個什麽東西在那兒和賽跑一樣，跳得叮叮咚咚的　丨要使你先生膽小，一定會以爲篇是什麽鬼怪，駭怕起來的。可是，不誇口丨丨我猜着那是老鼠了。我想起白天看見那屋角有個洞，定會是從那兒進來的。我扭亮雷燈，跳下床，先就到屋角把洞擋好，然後抓了一把菜刀，拚命的跟着老鼠滿屋趕，結果這一夜我雖然又吃了力又少睡了一個鐘頭的覺，但老鼠的頭確是被我砍掉了一個。</p>
<p>以後的幾夜確實清靜了。我想着那是我努力的代價，心笑了。</p>
<p>到最近的晚上，似乎常常醒來總聽着樓板上又有什麽東西在跳舞。妻怕冷。也怕給我凍壞了不許我再那麽勇敢的努力殺鼠，雖然是我們都清楚的聽得老鼠在嚙壁上的醃肉。</p>
<p>第二天早晨，起來看見醃肉失去了一個洞。可是晚上又聽着老鼠響時，妻說：讓安它充其量再吃一個洞去，有這許多醃肉怕什麽。</p>
<p>第三晚上老鼠又咬得肉響。妻還是那副老調：有這許多醃肉，小老鼠兒那裏吃得完，頂多明天再來一個洞；還是不要躭誤了睡覺吧。這一次我又不得起來。心裏想：</p>
<p>衹須花一點力，就可以拿老鼠趕走。叝偏要怕冷，貪睡覺，讓醃肉一個洞一個洞的少下去。也許再睡兩覺起來，醃内没有了。···</p>
<p>面寒瑟瑟的乞丐向酒醉飯飽踏出酒家的朋友行乞，一個說没有，一個説討厭，一個說滾開點。</p>
<p>借印子錢的孫先生，梜子摩登的情婦，從永安公司手裏提了許多東西出來。同時在吃着巧格立糖。</p>
<p>雷車站有一個鄉下人，哭　泣着自己的錢不知在什麽時光没有了。許多人圍着他作無謂的竊笑與不關心的可憐，最後大家都　散了。</p>
<p>我在馬路上隨着萬人如海的潮流中走着。</p>

<h3>小園藝　梅　黃海客</h3>
<p>隆冬風雪之候，一切花；一切樹，死的死；枯的枯了。惟有梅樹大矯獨立，在那裏和風雪作戰，且還開出香馥馥的花來，比了松柏更　活色生香，精神百倍。反所以以梅花作吾國的國花，我以爲是最最適當的了。梅本是熱帶的樹，南方如江蘇，浙江，安徽，江西，廣東，廣西等處，都有出產，旣能開花，又能　實，旣供觀賞，又合實用，並且不擇土壤，無論沙土黄土地山地荒地，全可種植；也不論氣該塞暖，陰陽向背，開花的時候自然開花；結實的時候自然結實，從來不會失期的。花有　色的；有白色的，有單葉的；有千葉的，另有微帶緑色的一種，稱爲緑蕚梅。南方的梅，結實的居多，北方有杏梅榆梅，那只會開花而不會結實，但供人們欣賞而已。所結的實，有大有小，江南觀賞梅花最著名的地方：蘇有鄧尉；浙有超山；粤有羅浮；每當花時，游人絡繹。超山有宋梅，膾炙人口，鄧尉產梅之地，稱［香雪海］，也是人所共知，可是近年來晨家因種橋利益不多，所以大半改種桑樹和别的花樹，這是多麽殺風景的事啊！</p>
<p>昔人愛梅，以林和靖爲最著　，梅妻鶴子，艶稱今古，他的墳墓在西湖孤山，因此山上也滿種稱花，頗有孤芳自賞之致。古今來詩人量客，詠梅畫梅的極多，好詩好畫好文章，舉不勝舉。兒時讀龔定庵［病梅館記］，至今還琅琅上口，在畫中很愛金冬心的作品，古色古香，印象極深。明代有名士張大復，最愛梅花，有［梅花草堂集］，所作筆談，雋永可喜，記梅的文字尤多，如梅云：［庭梅將開，有一枝偃蹇，欲披其上小枝，蕚正繁，予不忍。或云：］宜亟剪以專其氣。］童子戲投腴水中，花　爛開，碩而圓。澤於本根者，毛嬙西西子之人後宫也。　朝日；焕浮雲；設老於江臯，獨存標格耳。嗟夫！］老梅云：［老梅悴悴欲盡，爾尊務玉蝶　株，將易之，予低徊不忍。旣數日，條有勾萌，乃植玉蝶於此，剛一步許，意雖萌不悴也。今忽成蔭數花，如雪交枝布，葉中作絲　，夏雨灑灑，移時不漏。予佇立良久，飄風送濕乃去。庭梅云：［庭中梅花，爲陰雨所勒，半妝輒止。朝來　色可喜，花亦爛開如雪，陣陣游蜂，作深夜　　聲。戲取昨歲贈語，令債亟雜歌之，命酒再酌。僧孺誇吾山頭萬樹，何如此三尺地一番香雪也？］千綠梅云：［梅之品，蕚綠者最，然予故未見千葉綠梅也。昨歲止月二十九日，遇於魏　廉　舍之南，奇香鮮綠，英英逼人，燃烚燈照之，光態浮瑩。時有吳生趨彈；沈生吹簫；圶生度　；予素不解飲酒，竟沉醉。今忽一年矣。寒威且轉，梅萼再敷，偶想見其處，以語虞山王維烈，輒寫一幅見投，命兒子掛息訪中，潑洞山𡵚賞之，覺香氣馥馥，從壁間出，蓋丁未之元日也。］這樣的妙文，眞是不厭百回讀的。臘梅是梅的别支，花瓣作黃色，花心有紅有黃，黃心的稱爲素心臘梅，較爲名貴。張先生也有一段文字，寫得極好，其文如下；［臘梅爛開，浮香直人樸際·小坐綺疏下暗想海潮府尺許黄玉，忽爾盈庭，故知物靜則生，自然條暢，雖復敷花受敵，不能勝根本之寗息也。頃在婁東，移植水仙一器，又得此花映帶左右，歲事豈不旣濟矣乎？］△△△△△</p>

<h3>疼心</h3>
<p>— 了紅瘦鵑</p>
<p>這種出人不意的情形，當然的，直使不方生夫婦，大大的吃了一驚，不約而同，齊喴［阿呀］！尤其是膽小而穉氣的理方生夫人，幾乎驚的要哭。</p>
<p>當下，夫婦二人也無睱問是怎魔一回事，一個急着關門；一個急着把他這雪堆成的身子，連扶帶挈的搬進内室。一個急着問碍事不碍事；一個便急試他的鼻息；撫他的胸膛。一個急急說：[快去燒口薑湯］；一個急急答說。［還是牛找白蘭地［。一個急急張羅乾燥衣服，一個又急急燃起了煖爐。在這種怱忙急驟的情勢之下，他們忘却去喚醒家中那個唯一的僕役。一切事事情，都由二人親自動手，紛亂了好一陣，方把他那凝凍的手足；停滯的血液；和疲乏過度的筋骨與神經，救護的漸次甦醒。</p>
<p>二人只顧爲他而紛亂，自己的衣服，没有扣好，竟也没有學察，並也忘却夜半寒氣的侵襲。</p>
<p>一小時後，他和東方生夫婦倆，已圍坐在一間小巧而精緻的屋中。淡淡的燈光，映着熊的爐火，類似初春般和暖的空氣，散滿了一室，任是寒威如何暴酷，可也不容易侵到這裏來。</p>
<p>這時節，他身上裹着他好友一襲新製的獺領海虎皮大氅，仰着面，　在一隻靠近炎爐的暖椅中。户蘭地酒和羊糕等三五樣食物，紛呈在他身旁一隻小几上。他甜蜜蜜軟綿綿洋洋地，如置身於春季垂曉時的野鴫絨新被中，双像飄浮在雲霧之間。除了神經微覺麻木，其餘四肢百骸，一切只學輕鬆舒泰。他對室中柔和的燈光，竟如久别的良友，尤其感到特别的好感，因而惺忪的視線，時刻凝視不瞬。他想起方才的情况，轉凝此刻是在做夢，僅僅一小時前後，境地便大不相同。他迷惘着，不信在同一個世界中，一二小時的過程内，竟有這絶對不同的兩種境地。</p>
<p>當他如醉如迷之際，外邊的風聲，依舊在狂吼，似因攫不到他的身軀而發怒，窗檽受震，格格地怪響，也像他方才全身骨格的顫戰一樣。外邊的風雪，雖不能再犯他的肉體，但一聽這可怖之聲，猶目使他的精神惶悚不安。更使他不明白的自已怎會在這排山倒海似的風雪陣中，如何能衝突而出。（四）</p>

<h3>好人與壞人</h3>
<p>— 天方</p>
<p>是非善惡，眞是難明的事，因爲［是非］是相應而生不是絶對的，而［善惡］又没有一定的標準，好惡頗有不同，加以在這漆黑一團的社會裏，要分别好人與壞人，眞是愚之又愚。</p>
<p>但這其間，似有一種羅邏輯，就是强者准是好人，而弱者一定是壞人，有地位有勢力的是好人，而没有地位，没有勢力的便是壞人，那是一定不易的道理。，</p>
<p>第一個例證，譬如身居顯要，勢燄炙手可熱時，都是無瑕可摘的完人，一旦勢力旁，下台遠蹈的時候，那末函電詰責，至少有十人罪狀可辦，似乎這一切罪惡都。在下台前一夜趕作的一樣，否則事前何以一無所聞，昨日的忠實同志，今日忽一變而爲國民的公敵呢，事情眞有點滑稽，曾記得某院長下台時，某部長有通電揭發，謂在武漢掌財政時，曾梛用公帑若干，某要人由市長來任江海關監督，監督數月，飄然走粤，於是報紙上又看到虧空公欵之百萬的新聞，最近招商局某監督又有受賄七十萬的傳聞，某因昨日的紅人，而今日已成逃逋客，我不怪這班貪官污吏，做事做得太秘密，我只怪新聞界消息太不靈通，不早些告訴我們，却事後來放馬後砲，我們這班人雖常以中華民國的老板自傲，但若照上海話說起來，實在是蠟燭店裏的小開因爲身居局外，從未查過一回賬，究不知内幕是眞是假，最後嚴辦終於不辦，終於又相見一堂，前嫌盡釋，所謂十大罪狀，到此時似乎是醉後戲言，不足憑信了，大人物的態度，使我們辦認不出究誰是好人，誰是壞人，這是權勢的有無，是好壞的轉移的一個明證。</p>
<p>第二個例證，日本侵佔我東北後，我政府不敢府不敢出兵抵抗，并不敢公然備戰佈防，像是做了虚心事似的，而日本叝振振有詞，似乎爲正義與東亞和平起見，非將中國代庖不可，各國雖不說中國［十分不好］，却是［準不好］，國聯調查團報告書，不是論着，中國内政不修，民族主義敎育的不對，而抵貨運動更是不適當嗎，可見日本是在［替天行道］，而中國却是十足的壞人，但我想，假如中國換了美國呢。</p>
<p>第三個例證是丢］着家裏的父母妻子，拚着性命去做綁票匪的，該是十惡不赦的壞人，而家貲巨萬，衣錦食肉的，却準是好人，因爲他不去做綁票，而且也不想。</p>
<p>例證甚多，可以類推，所以是非善惡的本體　我們雖不可知，然而一般的好人與壞人，我們可由地位權勢而認識。</p>

<h3>科學</h3>
<h3>太陽燈和紫外繳</h3>
<p>— 新</p>
<p>太陽燈的用途，就是利用　的紫外線，來預防或醫治某種疾病；是近代科學進化，對於治療上的新供獻。</p>
<p>原理　我們早已知道太陽光有殺菌的能力，能滅除各種皮膚病的微菌，給與我們利用陽光來悄毒的機會。但是這能力從何而來的呢？經許多科學家的屢次研究，知道太陽除了有赤，橙，黃，綠，青，藍，紫，七邑合成白的陽光外在紫色外邊，更有波長極短，目不能見的光線，使太陽有消毒的能力。因牠的地位在紫色外，所以稱牠紫外線。</p>
<p>因是，有人說要强健身體，防止疾病，宜作太陽浴；但是太陽離開地球及遠紫外線的量不多，經過空氣圈時，易爲吸收。並且太陽祇在晴天能見，即如冬季的太陽也已失治療的能力，因此才用人工造成極强的光，代替太陽，給多量的紫外線。</p>
<p>裝置　太陽燈的主要部分，是發光的燈頭。這燈頭因玻璃有阻止紫外線的能力，所用石英，燒至攝氏表三千六百度以上的熱力，融成孤形的管，管内裝有水銀蒸氣，二端固封。再以電流通入，便生極强烈而富有紫外線的光，電流的電壓有變壓器，自動調節，所以不論二百二十或一百十弗特的交流電，和直流電，都可以用，但電池的壓力太小，不能發强光。</p>
<p>功效　紫外線的主要治療力有三：</p>
<p>（一）直接殺菌作用　能致死微生蟲，和幾種寄生蟲；所以常常用治各種皮膚病，像瘡，癬等；局部的結核病，並能使人體增加對於微生蟲的抵抗力。</p>
<p>（二）經（Ｅrgosteroic27H42）的作用，產生維他命丁，我們身體中的鈣和燐二種重要元素，全靠着維他命丁，才得保持，不然，像孩童必生軟骨病，手足搐搦等病症。所以我們若缺少維他命丁，可以常用紫外線照射，使身體内的（Drgosteroi變成維他命丁。换言之，就是能治療及防止軟骨病等症。</p>
<p>（三）良性發炎的反應初次照射太陽燈，皮膚上因受剌激，便起紅斑，這就是良性發炎的徵象。其時能使血管　奮，而於大，血液能暢流，並能與奮腦筋</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>和青春線，精神充足，發育完全。</p>
<p>注意　使用太陽燈照射，宜注意的地方很多。</p>
<p>（一）照射前，須戴護目鏡。避免强烈的光耀，和紫外線的直射兩眼。否則有損目力。眼鏡旁須有小孔，使空氣流通。</p>
<p>（二）開燈後五分鐘後，始可照射。因初開時紫外線的量不多，並在五分鐘内燈頭或有突然破裂的危險。</p>
<p>（三）第一次照射時，皮膚受剌激，生細小紅斑，這是良性的發炎，並非病象切勿恐懼；紅斑隔一二日即能褪去。（四）照射時間不宜過長。第一次照射，至多不可過一刻鐘；以後日漸增加，但最長時間，也不得過一小時。</p>
<h3>年的交替</h3>
<p>— 華</p>
<p>年關一近，阿大的娘又急得走頭無路了，前一月向吃閒飯阿福哀求來的五元錢，早已化得一干二凈，現在呢；天氣更冷，鵝毛般雪，也下過了一次，身上還祇一件薄的小襖兒，一天的工地夫，大都縮在破絮裏，除了大正午時起來尋一口兒東西裝飽了她和阿大的肚子外，一點事兒都不能做，本來像她一個人，早没了爹娘，又遇到了這個不關痛癢的丈夫，加了一樣手藝都没有會，生在這種環境裏，當然是不過坐過坐以待斃而已，急煞也没得法子的呀，</p>
<p>雖然；她日日在希望着何大親父，像出去時的話一般兒的錦衣，肉食的回來，接她去亨福，可是她的希望，總没實現過一天，她想到了阿福討債時那幅煞神般面孔，米店裏的收賬員的狂呌，處處顫動她的心弦，樣樣誘惑她的理智，有時她想着去做尼姑，可是安排不了阿大，有時也曾起過賣淫過活的念頭，可是想到了族中人的鄙視，又漸漸的打消了，她不能違反禮敎，她不忍抛棄她的兒子，她更不忍使她丈夫回來時的難堪，她總於一天一天的徬徨着，過那單調生活，</p>
<p>可是她今年明白了，她下了最後的决心，她知道族中人不給她生活費，而寗可着着她向那襲不相　的人跪號，她知道他們不以爲她是他们的族中人，他們把她當作下人，奴隸，甚至禽獸般的看待，惟有自己人留下來的肉，丨阿大啊丨才是族中人，</p>
<p>爆竹送去了一個舊的，换上一個新的，人們抛棄了舊的，穿上了新的，家家都表示愉快，處處都充滿了喜氣，惟有那何大的家裏，靜俏俏的不見人兒，</p>
<p>阿大到底那裏去了呢？他並没有走開，他仍縮在絮裏，漲圓了眼，充滿了涙，呆呆地，呆呆地，睜着懸在窗前的慈母，已爲了她自己的前程，棄了他們而去，</p>
<h3>竹槓專家</h3>
<p>— 迓施</p>
<p>這時我剛吃過飯。正在宿舍間洗着面。校内素稱滑稽大王的丁君。偶然跑進來了。他就開口說我有一椿實確的趣事告訴你咧。我問有什麽趣事。他道。就是上月你看見的那個大塊頭。我素來與他面不相識。他一定說是大在××中學與我同過了學的。我也怕是自已忘記了。人家旣來找你。要是不招等。又覺得很不在道理，哈哈。誰知他是個敲竹槓的專家。令天來。要請我到戲院裏看電影。我見他如此親善。又不好推辭。如是只好同往。誰知走到了門首。他假用手在衣袋裏摸摸。眼睛向着我說。呵。皮夾子在家裏忘了帶出來。這怎麽辦呢。我見他說忘記了。這也是尋常的事。我就連忙在自已袋裏。把皮夾子拿出來。說着我有。我有。他見我這樣。他就咪咪笑着說。老兄。小弟今天實在抱愧極了。祇好下次再重請吧。就從這次以後。不是請我看電影。就是請我吃大菜。他却只走到目標地。皮夾子不是忘在家裏去了。便是在路上給扒手扒去了。像這樣弄了十餘回。總是我用錢。迓兄。你看這種的竹槓。我怎肯還挨下去呢，上星期日。他又來了。我那時就想了一個妙計。心裏想道。來得正好。即各他笑道。仁兄。我們往日總是在小館子裏吃點馬虎東西。今天非要在大館子裏吃得好一些不可。他聽了這話。連贊道。好極了。我當時便同他往××酒樓去吃了五六個最合時令的貴菜。也就吃得大飽。　又喊着室倌再添上兩個好菜。堂償去了。我便　問着他說　仁兄。你少坐片刻。我到對過弄堂裏厢去出個小恭即刻就來。哈哈。我那裏是要出小恭。確是一口氣跑回校中來了。這一回皮來子即使飛上了天。只怕也不興吧。迓兄。自從我這一弄。他至今再没有來請我咧。</p>
<h3>蘿卜青菜荳腐湯</h3>
<p>— 菖子</p>
<p>東亞病夫的中國。國亡旣在目前；而滅種恐怕也不遠。有句成語說：［民强則國强］。由此可以知道中國衰弱的最大原因。就是人民的不健康而來的。這次市敎育局認識了最大病根丨不康健丨所以在近來提倡［康健講比竇賽會］使人民注意健康的事。這是對於弱的中國多麽好的一件事。</p>
<p>昨天是全市中學預賽期。高中部在務中大禮堂。我因爲要多得些健康的常識。所以不遠千里换乘了三輛電車奔到務本去聽康健演講。</p>
<p>我們要知道專門限制在康健方面的題目。確實是不容易做的，可是有很多的演講題目，旣新奇而且又内容很合於康健方面。對於怎樣使身體康健的常識，有極大的貢獻。我不聚敢藏着我自己知道。所以在這裏宣佈給大衆知道。</p>
<p>有一位男同學的講題是［蘿卜青菜荳腐湯］，他把三種東西所含的成分講得很明白，他說：［有維他命Ａ·Ｂ·Ｃ·Ｇ了２了</p>
<p>蘿卜助消化，青菜清血液，頭腐湯含的蛋白質比牛肉多。這三種東西旣經濟而又有益於身體。我們爲什麽不去吃牠呢　　一位女同學講［香蕉與康健］她講香蕉的成分分析得很透澈，而且說是天然的罐頭食品在小菓中是最有益於身體的，所以要使身健康在吃水菓時多吃些香蕉才好，</p>
<p>還有位是講」青年性的問題」這個題目我没有聽得清楚。困爲當時會塲上有特别鬧的聲音。總之，我說性的問題在中國是認爲很秘密。而穢襲的問題。其實具體說起來。要使青年身體的健康，這種問題確有討論的必要，</p>
<p>還有許多都講得很好，所謂［美不勝收］我當然不能一一的舉出來，大槪而論。其他的演講員都在注意說中國人的什麽病什麽病和補救的方法。也不外是注重體育與衛生的事，</p>
<p>我昨天餓着肚子聽這演講。使我感到在我們日常生活中能辦到而有益於身體的。就是吃飯時多吃些蘿苟蔔青菜豆腐湯。吃水菓時多吃些香蕉。這裏我再提出介紹給讀者們。</p>
<h3>閒話</h3>
<p>— 宣武</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>在健身房裏。足球塲上······是一般長個子。黑毛腿表現牛力氣的時候。無非博得幾聲女同學鼓掌的聲音而已。可是在考塲裏却是一般載老光眼鏡。彎腰駝背，手無縳鷄之能的白面書生一現身手的時候。發下來的題目很難。而他却很早底交了卷。得意洋洋底走也考塲。怎不使女生羨煞。急煞。</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>人家說大半美國人著一本書。外表是厚而美麗。而裏面却亦没有什麽大道理或觀。英國人著一本書。外表是薄薄無幾頁底一個小册子。而却是内容豐富，大有可觀底有價値底書。至於中國人的大作那就不得而知了。</p>
<p>（三）</p>
<p>總有一天學校招生的廣告有這樣底一類話；「······本校男生宿舍與女生宿舍祇隔薄板一層······「。」本校地點適中，交通便利，前有××公司。後臨××跳舞廳。左近××醫院。右是××大戲院］。</p>
<p>（四）</p>
<p>花一隻洋買一張CnrixtmawCard送給愛人。似乎是義不容辭的事。可是勸他慷慨解囊捐一點錢給難民和東北義勇軍。他到摸出一把當票來［哭窮］。</p>
<p>（五）</p>
<p>我想將來一定有人編一部救國辭典把什麽跳舞國。電影救國。游藝救國，馬將救國。妓女救國····都採爲材料。　（六）</p>
<p>有人把［要人］兩字拆開來是［西女人［三字。所以他就用三段論法來一分析。我不知道對不對姑且寫下鶆兩說。大前提；［要人］等於「西女人」即外國女人也。</p>
<p>小前提；「外國女人」是唯金錢是命。結論；所以要人亦是「唯Monej」史觀的信奉者。</p>

<h3>找出路！因人而殊</h3>
<p>— 編者</p>
<p>這幾天，我們接到屠耀昶王宇屏胡世敬三君的來信；都表示不滿於目下的職業，想另［找出路］，以其解决生活問題，經我們詳細研究的結果；認爲同一「找出路」的問題，解答叝不能不因人而殊。　　（一）屠君是舊式工廠裏已經滿師三年的工友，在學街時代，受盡許多磨折；現在工資微薄；想起將來家庭重任。不能負擔；怨望悲哀與恐懼交作。因思另「找出路」·編者以爲學徒時代的痛苦業已過去；屠君不必因回憶而怨望。說什麽「人間牛馬」「人間地獄」等話·應當因此而俞愈益重視其已得之核術：不宜改絃更張，致使多年辛苦。等於虚擲。至於以後的問題。也不宜過於憂慮。只須抓住「現在」的一刹那。力謀自己技術的進步；那末「行行出狀元」。到得那時，　　自然迎刃而解了。</p>
<p>（二）王君是烟兌店裏才蒲師的夥友，因爲該店規模甚小，無甚希望，而思另「找出路」，我們對於王君因執業之店，規模太小而思别就。當然表示同情，但别就的範圍，應當予以愼重考慮！是否爲本人能力所能勝任；在没有把握以前，更須出以秘密。免得進退兩難。</p>
<p>（三）胡君是一爿小茶葉舖裏的學徒，這爿店，據胡君説：每日營業，不過六七元；除「市洋帳」一本之外。没有其他帳簿；除店主（另有職務）及胡君外。别無夥友。所以胡君非但不能進窺茶業的堂奥，並且連普通的商業經絡。也無法學到；而在這種環境之下，也斷無出頭的希望。「人生幾何！不容蹉跎」。我們以爲胡君除於職務餘暇勤求學術外，非亟謀别就不可！至於進行的方法。可先多託親友。並留心各種機會。惟亦須與王君同樣的嚴守秘密。</p>

<h3>同情者（十六續）</h3>
<p>— 張恨水</p>
<p>孟國寳眞是王老二的知己，王老二總也算能知道孟國寳的。果然像他的話。這天晚上，孟國寳又到打麥塲上來和王老二談天來了。王老二問他什麽時候到省裏去呢，他却猶豫了一會子。答道：那没有一定。也許住十天半個月，也許住三五天就走。王二嫂在一邉却挿言道；三先生難得回來的。怎麽不多玩幾天呢？孟國寳道：我本來就在這兩三天要走的，因爲有點心事。打算過幾天再說。王老二笑道：孟三先生有心事，什麽事呢？孟國寳道：我們的心事。你們手挿田的人怎麽會知道呢？王老二笑着打了一個哈哈道：對了，你們讀書的人。心事不過在書本上·我們莊稼人那裏會知道呢？他如此說着，王二嫂坐在一邊。却不作聲。只有那芭蕉葉扇子劈劈拍拍的在身上撲蚊子聲。許久的時間。孟國寳却笑了道：其實我在書本子上的心事。倒不會和你談，那要說起來。你更不懂了。你們喜歡聽我說城裏頭繁華的情形。我也很喜歡你們說莊稼人的經騐，所以我們都談得來。王老二道：她本來要回娘家去一趟的。因爲貪着聽三先生說話，也没有去呢。孟國寳頓了一頓才道；原來如此，那我不走以前；總來談談。王老二道：城裏人總是討厭鄕下人的，像孟三先生這種人。眞是難得。孟國寳故意高了聲道：難道壉裏的人，都是好的，鄉下人都是壞的嗎？鄉下人都是本色。若是好起來。比城裏人還要好十倍呢。譬如古來那個最美的西施。他就是鄕下人。王老二笑道：我不是說女人。孟國寳道；我也不過是把女人打比。好像一盆鮮花，在鄉下種在菜地裏。大糞瓢澆着，誰看得起它。若是一天搬到城裏去。用瓷盆子栽了。花架子架起來。那豈不是一件寳　。唉！鄉下？鄉下蹧踏多少東西。老二。你是個聰明人。一定懂得我這話。王老二笑道：呵哥！</p>
<p>我聰明人。我由那裏聰明得起來？在一邊久寂寞了的王二嫂，這時却嘆嗤一聲笑了。孟國寳聽得這種笑聲。他的心裏。好像是無線電收音機。受了感應。蕩漾了一下，大家說話說到北斗星在樹頂上，方始散了。第二日上午。王老二工作去了。孟國寳却到他家來找他談話。雖没有找着他，却和王二嫂子談到太陽快落山才走。第二天。又是這樣。</p>

<p>史丹達新車車身尺寸。較諸去歲。大致相似。即小九號。大九號。及十六號。至新增兩種。即小十二匹。及大十二匹。則與小九號及大九號之車身尺寸。完全相同。惟新車所予人之印象。第一即係其彌較寬敞。關於此點。吾人如僅以其車身尺寸言之。則其所以彌較寛敞之理由。殊非片言可以解釋。但據鄙意。則其表版之量新配置。殆爲寛敞之主因，表版式樣。較爲淺平。並以大托盤。置於隔板右下方。藉作盛置雜物之用。駕駛者舉手即及。彌便取置。至於新車座位。則因裝有極便運用之標圖爲最新史丹達出品。照史丹達小九匹馬汽車模樣造。而具有十二匹力六汽缸引擎之汽車。</p>
<p>準機件。故其位置較低。塞車與輪桿。位置恰得其宜。效用亦因而彌宏。單版屏風。配有簡便開啓裝置。隨意使用。極便調度。若史丹達廿號式車輛。所裝屏風。且尤便啓放。蓋祇須一轉旋鈕耳。史丹達各式車上之屏風刷。悉爲氣裝置。且兼可使用雙刷焉。按此種種。即皆史丹達廿號特種車上所具有者。</p>
<p>考原有各式之新增輛中。尤以小九號爲具有特殊進步者。其特色之　　大者。計有三端。即電燈組。汽油表。及四擋速度齒輪箱是也。電氣設備。原係六沃爾脫。今則一變而爲十二沃爾脫。至於電力油量表。則架設於隔板。惟其有此種種改進。故小九號之精優完美。與設備周全。蓋與任何出品相伯仲。關於電燈組之意見。因人而殊。原非一致。惟以鄙意度之。則雖以其大體方面之種種進步。如更較堅殘底盤。及自動化汽機等。槪置不論。而僅以其由六沃爾脫改爲十二沃爾脫之一點言之。則此種式樣之加價四鎊十先令。已甚値得矣。</p>
<p>史丹達各種式樣。現一律裝用電力油量表。即小九號式。亦復有此裝置。至具有無聲之擋之四摚速度齒輪箱之裝用。則使小九號。因而得心應手。彌便操縱。新車各種式樣之共同優點。且最足使駕駛人欣慰者。即其益臻進步之彈性。按此蓋裝用加長彈簧及小壓級震器之自然結果也。</p>
<p>史丹達新車。絶無巓震之虞。蓋其前部引擎支架。今以像皮與彈簧之併合組織墊承之也。至於兩十二匹式。及兩九匹式。因以管轄踏板。架設於軸上。且係附屬於底盤。而不復與引擎部爲整個組織。故駕駛人得以藉其保障。益感安適。再因［蘇勒斯］自動化汽機。爲史丹達各式車上之標準設備。故雖初習駕駛者。亦因而有恃以無恐。不致因過度遏制而捐及汽缸壁。要而言之。史丹達新車。蓋不僅保持原有優點已也。且理發揚光大之。而使其精優美妙。卓絶羣倫焉。</p>
<h3>全世界汽車統計　呆</h3>
<p>共有三千五百萬輛</p>
<p>近來汽車事業。日見發達。而汽車之行駛於街頭者。其數量亦日多一日。然則目前世界各國。究有汽車若干。我人設加以統計。要亦爲一有趣之問題也。因將英國所編之全球汽車統計。錄之以實本刊。</p>
<p>據倫敦方面傳來之消息。關於汽車及鐵道事業之近狀。英國汽車雜誌。曾刋載其事。言之綦祥。以目前之情狀而言。運輸事業。英國有若干地點。雖呈停滯之象。而汽車事業。則仍日見發展。結果使鐵路事業。受到極大之影響。故英國當局。現正大聲疾呼。希圖挽救鐵路事業之不振也。</p>
<p>交通一事。近來急需改良。乃爲人盡皆知之事。而改良之唯一方法。則在營理得宜。駕馭小心也。英國所來經濟情狀。雖陷於不景氣象之中。然汽車事業。仍有無進展也。即以一九三一年而言。至九月底爲止。所產汽車。英國全國。計有九五·○○○輛。至於本年。在一般汽車界預料之中。各業雖因受經濟影響。而大有萎糜不振之狀然國内汽車之銷數。較之上年。至多不會超過减少百分之四以上也。</p>
<p>今更進而言世界各國。日前共有汽車若干。茲就以各洲爲本位。列表如次。則讀者不難可見一般也。</p>
<p>洲名　數量</p>
<p>歐洲　五·六八○·六五六</p>
<p>美洲　二八·一四四·九○六</p>
<p>亞洲　五七七·七四三</p>
<p>海洋洲　七四九·二二二</p>
<p>非洲　三六三·九一五</p>
<p>總數　三五·五一六·九一五</p>
<p>據上表所列。我人可知汽車之在今日。以美洲爲最多。蓋美國爲汽車事業先進之國。汽車事業。較他國自必發展。次爲歐洲。至於亞洲。雖地大物博。而汽車之婁數量。尙不及海洋洲也。非洲則較亞洲更少。以其地廣人稀。而未開化之土人。又居其多數也。全世界則有三千五百萬輛有零。至於汽車所消耗之燃料。在英國方面。一九三一年爲一·○二五·四六六·○○○加倫。而一九三○年則九九五·○○○·○○○加倫云。</p>
<h3>汽車花絮　摩亞</h3>
<p>支加哥之汽車竊賊</p>
<p>美國支加哥城之汽車竊賊。其數年有增加。警務當局對於此輩竊車君子。異常注意。一案旣生。偵騎四出。［務獲解究］差可形容。亦可見輩之活勵程度矣。支加可每年因車失竊。而受之損失。每年値一○。○○○○○○元。殊足驚人也。據警署及保險行之估計支加哥城中。每年失竊之汽車。其數逾三萬五千輛之多。其中雖有三萬輛於事後查獲。然十之九必受有損失。譬如零件之走動。車輪胎盤。火花塞。錶板等之缺少。不一而足。至於五千輛不後回返之汽車。其損失以每車五百元計。所値當在二·五○○·○○○元左右。亦不可謂不鉅也。再加以保險或未保險之所失車輛零件等價値。其總數自當在一○·○○○·○○○元矣。竊車犯中以年青人佔大多數。據警務處之紀錄。犯案者之年齡。在二十一歲下者。佔全數三分之二。</p>
<h3>加拿大汽車出產量</h3>
<p>加拿大之汽車出產數量。去年間頗有增進。一九三二年開首之七個月。其產量較之往年同時期間爲增加。七月間之出產量計爲汽車七轞七二輛。較之六月份之七·一三二輛增加百分之五。若於一九三一年七月比較。則當時之汽車產量祇爲四·二二○輛。其增加計多百分之七十七。七月份之汽車出口數。自一·二三三輛躍至二·六九九輛。其製造之汽車爲加拿大當地用者。由六月份之五七九輛。減低至四·七七三輛。七月份中進口至加拿大之汽車計一百十四輛。出口者一千五百四十輛。一九三二年開始之七個月中。在加拿大銷售之汽車。計約四二·九三九輛。一九三一年同時則爲六八·三五○輛。</p>
<h3>雪佛蘭車原料分析</h3>
<p>汽車之構造。其所用原料至爲廣廣泛。計凡鋼　木料·棉布·橡皮·玻璃等等。無不廣爲引用。故上至鋼鐵紋銀。下至地瀝青酸素等。均視爲需用之材料。今姑以雪佛蘭車分析言之。該車之造成。其所用主要材料。多至三十餘種譬如一輛標準之五座汽車。除煤氣。油及水等不計外。其車身重約二千六百六十五磅。其中以鋼鐵所佔之重量爲最鉅。可以伸縮及鑄鐵。重計四百九十二磅。鋼則自塊鋼以至鋼絲。重可一千六百零六磅。凡此種種之原料及其若干若副產品。均採自全美各省。其經濟人力所費珠殊屬不貲也。每車一輛除鋼鐵外。又有軟硬性之木料一百九十八磅。此項木料係專爲製造費休車身者。車身之製造其大部份材料爲木材及鋼類。故其經久耐用。廻不可及。此外車上用橡皮八十三磅。以作車胎及引擎中隔離之用。此項材料大都非產自美洲者。製造雪佛蘭車所用之風屏。玻窗·及燈具等。其所用之玻璃計五十四磅。用製座墊等之棉花需五十三磅。銅計二十六磅。精銅十七磅。美國西部之鉛礦。亦以其出品二十磅用作造車之用。尙有白蠟等不在其。每車製造時又用五·○一磅之錫。關於車身製造方面則用鍻。雲母·賽瑞路·　·銀等若干磅。造車時爲墊襯引擎及車頂等所用之紙重可十八磅。顏料及代學品所用亦多。約重十七磅。此外則酸素兩磅。油漆九磅。均爲必需之用品也。</p>

<h3>廿七年之等待時間</h3>
<p>美合業國之汽車駕駛人。每日在　馬路間因等待而消費之時間。至爲可駕。據美國汽車協所估計。全美汽車駕駛者。以每日平均在馬路間等待通過。費九分鐘之時間計算。則一日間所費於等待之光陰。綜計之當達二十七年之鉅。故汽車駕駛者於馬路間。每每急不及待。以候綠燈之開啓。其爲愛惜光陰。從可知矣。今姑以二十七年之光陰。如何積成。述之如次。凡大城市中。馬駱交又之處。必有管理交通之紅綠燈。據嚴格之統計。每一汽車駕駛者。每日在馬路間。等待通過之時間。平均爲五分鐘。至九分鐘。各城市之汽車駕駛者。大約有一五·○○○·○○○人。平均以每五個人用車一輛計。則用車之人其數約爲三·○○○·○○○人。則每日間即以每人等待五分鐘計。亦在二十七年左右矣。此外因車輛之等候而費之汽油。若以年計。其數量及價値亦不在少數也。</p>
<h3>英國汽車製造業之新計劃　甘</h3>
<p>注意海外銷售政策</p>
<p>减輕成本大量出產</p>
<p>邇來不列顚汽車製造家。對於已往之海外銷售政策。頗多訾議之處。而對於因不能考查當地之需要以適應國外及帝國各部之市塲銷售者。尤爲注意及之。此外如汽車售出之後。不作充份之服務設備。亦爲往日汽車銷售上缺點之一。最後一點。則謂英國所造之汽車。其初步代價。殊屬過度。尤以國内市塲之價格爲最。此處批評。在　多種情况之下。無從否認。且除汽車製造業外。其他製造事業。亦多坐此病也。但欲求攏脫此種困難。事實上亦殊易爲。因國内市場之需要。及國外之汽車使用者。其需要常截然相反。故以前爲求獲得海外市塲之根基計。祇有構造一種特别之［殖民地］模型。以應需要耳。</p>
<p>據營出口業者稱。近來英國汽車製造事業。情勢已爲之一變。無論國内國外。咸有此種趨勢。職是之故。英國之汽車製造業。其地位又達於樂觀之途矣。英國因經濟衰落之故。小規模之汽車製造廠。無從有發展之希望。於是少數規模較大之製造廠即起而代之。馴至國内汽車市塲爲數家製造廠所主持。又因經濟奇絀之故。社會上少數富有資產之階級。近亦棄置華麗之汽車不用。而代之以大量出產之汽車。以爲代步致遠之需。至於此種情况。其計數若何。則一時亦無從計算之。總之最近英國之國内汽車市場。日有發愜展之趨勢。縱社會上個人之收入。均有趨减之勢。亦無予耳。具有上述數種原因。英國汽車製造界之現狀。乃爲汽車模型减少而出產則大增。非若往日之出產少而花色多也。故自今日之情况言之。英製私用　車之半數。其營業均爲兩家汽車製造廠所包辦。迴非、讕言。</p>
<p>今日英國汽車製造之費用。其成本業已减輕。此亦不能加以否認。具其减價所得之利益。已爲國内外買主所亨受。海外經濟衰落之影響。對於英國之汽車製造事業。亦頗有助。蓋由此已引起製造時注意於經常費之低减也。此項使用時之經濟。爲英製汽車之高尙優點。足與其他競爭者相頡抗。此外又可爲英國汽車製造業慶者。即邇來外國各地之道路。日就改良。幾與英吉蘭相仿。故凡普通之汽車。專銷國内市塲者。均能於海外暢用無阻也。</p>
<p>緣前述各尊優勢下之結果。英國汽車製造之海外貿易。其出口方面。較之一九二九年最發達之年。所跌殊屬有限。此乃與英國之勁敵。美國與加拿大相比而言。美國及另拿大兩國。其一九三零年及一九三一年。兩年相加之出口低落數。約佔百分之六十八。而不列顚之出口低落數則祇佔百分之四十而已。其尤關重要者。厥爲輸入澳洲之車輛統計。此項統計係最近海外貿易部所綂編纂者。内稱自英帝國輸入澳洲之未配裝汽車車架。計共四百四十切件。價値三八·八八六鎊。自美合衆國輸入者爲七十二件。値六千零四千七鎊。至裝已配全之汽車及車身等。亦以英國所輸入者爲多。機器脚踏車則全數爲英國所製造者。計一百零九件。自英國輸入紐絲蘭之汽車。其趨勢亦復相等。汽車之輸入紐絲蘭者。今年開首之六個月。其數目爲十一年來發低者。但英製汽車之優勢。則仍屹然不動。蓋價値二六七·一四三鎊之一·八八三輛汽車總數中。其一·四一五輛。價値二四七·五七五輛係由英國輸入也。故自各方面觀之。苟或當世界百業恢復原狀時。英國製造界之能得到世界市塲之優越地位。殆可斷言。至其出口數目之能超越一九二九年四二·○二一之中庸數目。亦意是事耳。</p>

<h3>Jiuguan Pass: Two Armies in Standoff</h3>
<p>Japanese troops launched a fierce attack yesterday morning, our troops resisted strongly and retreated slightly.</p>
<p>Part of the Japanese troops and puppet police advanced to near Jiuguan Pass's Lijia Fort. Japanese troops are constructing defensive works.</p>
<p>Japanese warships off Qinhuangdao have taken no action so far.</p>
<p>Linyu: On the morning of the 12th, six Japanese aircraft fiercely bombed Jiuguan Pass, covering a combined force of infantry, cavalry, and artillery in a fierce attack. Our guard troops firmly defended their positions, and only began firing when the enemy advanced to within 300 meters of the position. The enemy repeatedly attacked and was repeatedly repulsed, suffering heavy casualties. Subsequently, the enemy became more numerous and their firepower intensified. Infantry on both flanks surged in,</p>
<p>forming an encirclement. Our troops defended to the death and finally repelled the enemy in front of them, then automatically withdrew to a certain position. A large number of Japanese troops occupied a position near Lijia Fort outside the Pass and are constructing fortifications. A part of the Japanese troops and puppet police, about two hundred men, have advanced to Jiuguan Pass, but show no sign of advancing further. The two sides are in a standoff. (12th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Japanese troops attacking Jiuguan Pass were fiercely repulsed by our forces last night. This morning, the enemy used plainclothes puppet troops to create disturbances. Japanese troops outside the Great Wall fired more than ten artillery shells as a show of force. This morning, Japanese aircraft flew over Heishanwo Village and dropped several bombs. A certain brigade of our army is advancing in succession and installing military telephones along the way. More than a thousand residents inside Jiuguan Pass have established a "Joint Village Association" to assist the garrison in defense. The Shihu River front line is stable. Two Japanese aircraft flew over Shihu River this morning for reconnaissance. (12th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Several hundred puppet troops are concentrated ten miles away from Jiuguan Pass, under Japanese supervision, attempting to create disturbances. Our defenses are solid, and the enemy suffered many casualties. Japanese aircraft scattered leaflets, doing their best to spread rumors and incite unrest. The situation in Qinhuangdao is tense. (12th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Linyu: For several days, the weather in the Linyu-Qinhuangdao area has been cold, reaching zero degrees.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the soldiers on the front line remain vigilant day and night, with high morale, never slackening. On the 11th, more than twenty enemy soldiers advanced from the Shihu River Bridge and were repulsed by our guard troops. In the evening, several enemy cavalry scouts were discovered near Zhangzhuang in front of our position. Our cavalry shot down one horse. Also, at about 8 PM, the enemy continuously set off fireworks signals at Jiaoshan Temple. (10th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Linyu: Three Japanese warships are anchored in the sea off Yuguan, unloading large quantities of ammunition and supplies to the Japanese barracks for several consecutive days. (12th Special Dispatch)　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　(12th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The situation in Qinhuangdao is increasingly tense. Under the pretext of our army capturing a spy, the Japanese naval landing force may take action tonight. We have taken strict precautions. (12th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) After the Japanese army's attack on Jiuguan Pass was repulsed, there was no attack this morning. A hundred or so puppet troops and police are stationed ten miles outside Jiuguan Pass, advancing from time to time and firing shots to create disturbances. (12th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) This morning, a certain organization received a telegram from its military special commissioner from Jiuguan Pass, stating roughly that, at 10 PM last night, about a thousand enemies</p>
<p>advanced from Liujiagou towards Jiuguan Pass, firing mortars at our position. A certain battalion of our troops defended the mountain pass and fought back fiercely for an hour. The enemy was unable to succeed due to the rugged mountain roads and fierce north wind.</p>
<p>In this battle, over seventy enemies were killed and one machine gun and over thirty pistols were captured. Because the severe cold was fifteen degrees below zero, machine guns could not be used freely. Otherwise, all the enemies could have been annihilated. After the defeat, the enemy retreated to Lijia Fort and Liujiagou, waiting for reinforcements to counterattack. There is bound to be a major battle tonight. (12th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Rumors are rampant in Qinhuangdao. All shops only open a small hole to do business. (12th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Japanese tank car team of Yuguan fought fiercely with Wangjiatun, Lijia Fort, Jiuguan Pass, and Shimen Village last night and continues.</p>
<p>Enemy aircraft occasionally bomb our positions. Our troops hide in mountain valleys, covered with grass, making it impossible for enemy aircraft to detect them, rendering the bombing ineffective. A unit of Japanese cavalry launched an attack on Shimen Village last night and was repulsed by a certain battalion of our troops with machine guns. For days, the enemy has harassed our positions with cavalry under the moonlight at night, but none has succeeded. (12th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Enemy infantry, cavalry, artillery, and aircraft units attacked Jiuguan Pass and Shimen Village several times on the 11th all day long and were repulsed by He Zhuguo's unit and the Zhang and Wang units. The enemy suffered heavy casualties. The enemy then retreated to Jiaoshan Temple, Wangjiatun, and the rear to reorganize. At 7 AM on the morning of the 12th, the enemy army Suzuki sent another thousand infantry and artillery troops and five aircraft, advancing in stages to attack the Jiuguan Pass and Shimen Village positions. At the same time, enemy troops from Wangjiatun outside the Pass attacked Jiuguan Pass with tanks. Our troops relied on the dangerous terrain to defend firmly. The two sides fought each other for two hours. The sound of artillery fire rumbled and shook the mountains and valleys. Enemy warships stationed in the waters between Qinhuangdao and Yuguan also fired artillery to disturb our army's morale. Currently, our army's front line positions at Shihu River, Jiuguan Pass, and Shimen Village are stable. It is heard that the enemy has decided to transfer the Jinzhou aircraft unit to threaten Jiuguan Pass. (12th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Linyu: Japanese warships off Qinhuangdao have taken no action as of 8 PM on the 12th. (12th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) There was no fighting on the front lines this afternoon. Our positions are unchanged. Morale is very high. Three Japanese warships are still anchored off Qinhuangdao, carrying out transport and supply work. A Japanese gunboat is patrolling the port area of Tanggu. (12th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Jiuguan Pass is still in fierce fighting. The sound of mortars was heard throughout the night in Qinhuangdao, reportedly from the confrontation in Lijia Fort. Reinforcements from a certain area of our army have arrived, greatly boosting morale. Jiuguan Pass still has natural defenses, so it should be safe. (12th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The enemy troops have been attacking Jiuguan Pass for two days and two nights. Their forces are exhausted and have suffered heavy casualties. The attack on the 12th was not intense.</p>
<p>Judging by their intentions, it seems they are waiting for reinforcements to arrive before launching a large-scale attack.</p>
<p>According to dispatches from the front, our reinforcements have arrived at Jiuguan Pass and are closely linked with Shimen Village, with high morale. The enemy is digging trenches and building ditches outside the Pass to prevent our troops from leaving the Pass. Qinhuangdao was peaceful on the 12th.</p>
<p>Enemy warships have taken no action. There is also no fighting at the Shihu River. (12th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Japanese regard Jiuguan Pass as the key route to Jehol and are determined to launch a full-scale attack to take it. Because our side is resisting desperately,</p>
<p>the enemy is unable to succeed. If they cannot take it in a short period of time, they will immediately instigate Japanese and Korean ruffians to collude with Chinese traitors to create disturbances in Tianjin and Beiping, plotting to disturb our army's morale and using this as a diversionary tactic. Our authorities are paying close attention to this. (12th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) More than two thousand men of the enemy Maotian unit arrived at Wangjiatun from Shenyang last night and immediately advanced along the Great Wall towards Jiuguan Pass and Lijia Fort to reinforce the troops previously in Suizhong and other areas. Military vehicles are piled up like mountains.</p>
<p>The Japanese are determined to seize the key passes of Jiuguan Pass and Shimen Village and have been actively sending reinforcements in recent days. A major battle is imminent. (12th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) It is now confirmed that Jiuguan Pass has fallen into the hands of the Japanese army.</p>
<p>All fronts are now calm. The north wind howls unabated. The climate in Beiping has dropped to fourteen degrees below zero (Fahrenheit scale). In mountainous areas such as Jiuguan Pass, the temperature may be thirty degrees below zero, making combat almost impossible. According to news from that area, the firing mechanisms of the Chinese military have all frozen and cannot be fired. The Japanese army is of course in the same situation. The weather is cold and the wind is strong. Trains are also delayed. The poverty and hardship in the plains are unspeakable. It is heard that several people have frozen to death. Yesterday, at the horseraces west of the city, the tails of the horses in the final race were covered in icicles. The coldness of the weather can be seen from this. (12th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>In Severe Cold Below Zero</h3>
<p>Frontline Soldiers' Morale High</p>
<p>What the Reuters Correspondent Saw on the Frontline</p>
<p>(Qinhuangdao) The climate is extremely cold and the hardships are enormous, but the Chinese soldiers defending the positions east of Qinhuangdao still have high morale. On Tuesday, the temperature dropped to zero degrees Fahrenheit, and yesterday the temperature dropped several degrees below zero. A Reuters correspondent inspected the Chinese army's front lines and saw that the Chinese soldiers' uniforms were cotton trousers and coats. As for leather clothing, only some officers had it. Despite such clothing, Chinese soldiers are still on duty in the trenches, often standing for as long as three hours. Their dwellings are Chinese-style village houses, most of which do not have stoves for heating. There are no temporary dwellings on the front lines. What they eat is mostly sorghum porridge, sometimes pancakes and noodles, and rice is not common, even for officers. The soldiers' health seems to be quite good, even in the cold weather.</p>
<p>Soldiers even take off their clothes to the waist to wash themselves. Members of the Red Cross have brought medicine here. The commander of the Third Cavalry Brigade lamented the difficulties faced by the Northeast Army after losing its base in Shenyang, and the difficulty of establishing a new base in mainland China. Discipline in all units is excellent. Their only luxuries are cigarettes and candy, but candy is not common. Various patriotic organizations are now providing supplies to comfort them, slightly reducing the soldiers' hardships. (12th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Beiping) Mutō, the commander of the Japanese army in the three northeastern provinces, ordered the Japanese army to concentrate in Jinxi as reinforcements for the Japanese army on the Jehol border. The volunteer armies of Feng Zhanhai and Liu Guitang in Kailu joined forces with Liu Zhendong's Fifth Army Corps and have been fighting fiercely with the Japanese army for several consecutive days.

<p>(Beiping) In Kailu, Chaoyang, and other counties, the Japanese side has been sending troops and transferring generals. Tens of people flee to Chengde from the two counties every day. In Kailu, except for the county government and the local garrison, most agencies only leave one or two people to defend. In addition, there is a local food shortage, businesses are closed, and the local finance is extremely depressed. Zhu Ziqiao is now organizing a grain price stabilization association in Jehol Province, and the grain situation is gradually stabilizing.

<p>(Beiping) The Liaoxi Volunteer Army of Zheng Guilin, with more than three thousand soldiers, took advantage of</p>
<p>the Japanese troops seizing Yuguan and then attacking our Jiuguan Pass and Shimen Village. Last night, taking advantage of the emptiness of Jinzhou's defense, they suddenly split up and advanced along the Da and Xiao Ling Rivers towards Jinzhou, and destroyed a section of the Xiao Ling River's Puppet Fengshan Railway Bridge. They are currently engaged in battle with Japanese troops across the river. (12th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>destroyed the bridge and railway tracks near Gaolingzi, and passenger cars were blocked in Jin County. The Hongluogang volunteer army also moved towards the Nu'er River and engaged in fierce fighting with Japanese armored cars. The situation in Jin is tense. (12th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese Army in Eastern Provinces Tortures and Kills Captured Volunteer Army Soldiers</h3>
<p>(Beiping) The Japanese army often inflicts extreme punishments on captured volunteer soldiers.</p>
<p>Recently, in Chaoyang Town, Hailong County, more than forty captured volunteer soldiers were imprisoned in a room, and thirty-seven died of starvation. The whereabouts of the rest are unknown. In Jinchuan, the Japanese army instructed puppet police dogs to bite four volunteer soldiers to death. At the same time, in Jinchuan, they instructed Koreans to saw two volunteer soldiers to death.

<h3>Japanese Army Establishes Airfield Outside Yuguan's East Gate</h3>
<p>Japanese Army Wantonly Massacres Citizens, Causing Utter Terror</p>
<p>Linyu: The Japanese have established an airfield outside Yuguan's East Gate, currently parking more than a dozen large and medium-sized aircraft and more than a dozen tanks. Japanese troops are stationed in all public agencies and primary and secondary schools in Yuguan City. Mines and iron wire netting are buried near the four gates. The movement of pedestrians is restricted to entering and exiting the South Gate. According to refugees who escaped, the Japanese army has been wantonly massacring people in recent days. In a certain laundry, because two old military uniforms were found by the Japanese army, two workers were shot and killed. More than a dozen policemen were disarmed and then mowed down with machine guns, dying at the same time. The citizens are terrified. There is no sign of the market recovering.

<h3>No Negotiations Held in Qinhuangdao</h3>
<p>Proposal to Hold Negotiations on British Warship Abandoned</p>
<p>Qinhuangdao: Today, the British naval authorities here proposed to both China and Japan that they would like to use a British warship currently docked in Qinhuangdao as a meeting place for the two sides to discuss whether to open preliminary negotiations. (11th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Qinhuangdao: The British naval authorities were willing to offer the British warship HMS Folkestone for use by China and Japan as a place to hold meetings and negotiations. Now, according to reliable sources, this proposal has been decisively rejected by both sides. (12th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Tonight, news in official circles all say that the front line is calm. There have been no battles in the last two days. The situation does not seem to be about to undergo a major change. Chinese officials issued a statement stating that no negotiations were held in Qinhuangdao. The reason why there is such a rumor is probably because the Chinese military commander sent an officer to explain to the Japanese side the matter of the Chinese army in Qinhuangdao arresting and executing a traitor.

<h3>Japanese Hand Over Customs at Yuguan</h3>
<p>Result of Protest by Qinhuangdao Customs Commissioner</p>
<p>Qinhuangdao: The Yuguan Customs, since the Japanese army seized Yuguan, has been occupied by the Japanese. From now on, it will be handed over to the management of the Chinese Customs.</p>
<p>This is due to the forceful protest of the Qinhuangdao Customs Commissioner. The Yuguan Customs has always been under the jurisdiction of the Qinhuangdao Customs Commissioner. (12th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese Reply Note Verbale Delivered to Ministry of Foreign Affairs Yesterday</h3>
<p>Ministry of Foreign Affairs Determined to Refute Again Harshly</p>
<p>(Nanjing) After the Yuguan incident, our Ministry of Foreign Affairs sent a protest to Japan on the 4th, and issued a statement recounting the history of Japanese provocations, hoping that the world would know that the Yuguan incident was started by Japan. After this protest was delivered to Japan, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, based on its premeditated policy, sent a reply to us that was full of sophistry and disregard for the facts, and declared that it reserved its right to demand compensation for losses. This reply note verbale was sent to Nanjing from Shanghai by the Japanese envoy and delivered to our Ministry of Foreign Affairs at noon on the 12th by the Japanese Consul in Nanjing, Uemura. It is heard that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has decided to refute this absurd reply again harshly. (12th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Japanese Consul Uemura returned to Nanjing from Shanghai on the morning of the 12th, carrying the Japanese government's reply to our Ministry of Foreign Affairs' protest, and personally delivered it to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at 11 AM. The full text is about five hundred words long, and it is entirely a statement to shift responsibility and evade the issue, stating roughly that the Japanese government respectfully replied to the protest note of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of your country on January 4 regarding the Shanhaiguan Incident, this Shanhaiguan Incident occurred on the night of the first day of this month,</p>
<p>when someone threw a bomb and opened fire at the residence of the Japanese military police. The Japanese government, in accordance with the rights under the Treaty of Tianjin, negotiated with the Shanhaiguan authorities of your country, and it was agreed by both parties to negotiate at the south gate of Shanhaiguan on the morning of the second.</p>
<p>Just as negotiations were about to begin, your country's troops opened fire with artillery at our troops, killing a Japanese lieutenant and three soldiers. The Japanese army, because your country's troops had attacked first, of course had to take self-defense measures, and therefore counterattacked. This was purely legitimate self-defense by Japan. If your country's troops had not fired first, this problem would not have occurred. The Japanese government reserves the right to claim compensation for all losses on the Japanese side in this incident. It is heard that this reply will be published simultaneously in Nanjing and Shanghai today and tomorrow. (12th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Imperialist Japan's Actions Arouse British Concern</h3>
<p>British Ambassador to Japan Visits Uchida and Warns Japanese Army Not to Invade Tianjin and Beiping</p>
<p>(London) The news from China is increasing the concern of the British political circles. All hope that the Shanhaiguan incident will not have any consequences, but they believe that Japan's move is intended to occupy the entire province of Jehol, so they are deeply concerned. However, the most recent developments will be submitted in Geneva on January 16, so London believes that this is a matter that the League of Nations should handle. (11th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) British Ambassador Lindley visited Foreign Minister Uchida at 11 AM this morning, saying that he was instructed by the British Foreign Office to warn Japan: "Since the Japanese army invaded Yuguan, the Japanese army seems to have the intention of invading Tianjin and Beiping. However, there are many British nationals, prosperous industries in the Beinings Road area. Britain's interests are huge, so we have to pay attention to the war in North China. We hope that the Japanese Foreign Office will consider this carefully and give a sincere reply." Afterwards, he asked about the Japanese Foreign Office's policy towards the League of Nations, and left after a brief conversation of half an hour. (12th Hualian Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Shanhaiguan Incident</h3>
<p>Ministry of Foreign Affairs Sends Note Verbale to Seven Countries</p>
<p>Japan Illegally Uses Special Treaty Rights</p>
<p>Signatory Countries Should Pay Attention</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the Shanhaiguan incident, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has sent note verbale to Britain, the United States, France, Italy, Belgium, Spain, and the Netherlands, the gist of which is: (The Japanese army illegally used the special rights of the 1901 treaty to occupy Shanhaiguan City, massacring thousands of peaceful and innocent Chinese people inside and outside the city, and damaging countless properties. It also concentrated large troops in the vicinity of Shanhaiguan and along the Beining Railway. The aforementioned countries are signatory countries to the treaty and should pay attention.) The note verbale also stated: (Under the aforementioned circumstances, the Chinese government cannot be held responsible in law or in fact for any situation arising from the Chinese army exercising its legitimate right to resist Japanese aggression.

<h3>Wang Jingwei's Appeal for World Peace</h3>
<p>If the League of Nations does not swiftly seek a fair resolution to the Manchurian issue,</p>
<p>China will have no choice but to fight to the end to protect its territory.</p>
<p>Yan, Gu, and Guo telegraph the government urging the recovery of Yuguan, alarming Geneva.</p>
<p>Japanese sources report that Sugimura and Drummond have already agreed on a compromise plan.</p>
<p>Yosuke Matsuoka's trip to Rome unexpectedly successful.</p>
<p>(Geneva) Today, Wang Jingwei, head of the Chinese Executive Yuan, issued a statement in Geneva, saying that when the Japanese use force to endanger China, the Chinese people have no choice but to fight for the sake of peace, righteousness, and justice. Once war breaks out, will it be limited to China and Japan? In the past sixteen months, China has sought a peaceful resolution in Geneva while resisting Japan's continued aggression. However, repeated delays have greatly disappointed the Chinese government and people. The Lytton Report has undoubtedly proven Japan's unfounded aggression and the fabrication of the Manchurian puppet state. Although China does not fully agree with the report's conclusions and regrets that the League of Nations lacks the power to stop aggression, it is willing to accept the report's general principles as a basis for open and frank discussion. It is now clear that Japan's policy is to obstruct, delay, and defeat the actions of the League of Nations, and to brazenly proceed with its aggression, hoping to confront the highest court in the world with faits accomplis at every stage and demand recognition of the existing reality. This is why the Japanese urgently attacked and seized Yuguan last month after obstructing mediation and before the meeting of the Nineteen-Member Committee on January 16. Japan's latest action not only provides China with further evidence that it must fight to the end to protect its territory and safeguard its national existence, but also constitutes another provocation to the League of Nations. If the League of Nations still fails to make a swift and fair decision and adopt effective methods to resolve the dispute, then peace can only be described as an illusion, and war will be the demon of world peace. If China despairs and offers long-term resistance to the Japanese warlords, then the price paid by China will be great, and the impact on the entire world will be unimaginable. (Reuters dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Wang Jingwei left Sping yesterday morning. People expected that he would return to China soon despite not being fully recovered from his illness due to the Yuguan incident. However, it is now learned that Wang and his entourage spent the night in Lüneburg yesterday morning, and according to the hotel manager, they took a train out of the country to Hoek van Holland today. If this is the case, then Wang's whereabouts are very difficult to grasp. (Reuters dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) As the Nineteen-Member Special Committee is about to meet, the Chinese representatives in Geneva, Dr. Yan Huiqing, Dr. Wellington Koo, and Guo Taiqi, telegraphed the Nanjing government, urging them to send troops to recover Yuguan as soon as possible. When this news came out, everyone was greatly shocked. The League of Nations is now worried that China's attempt to recover Yuguan will lead to a serious recurrence of the war, which may result in open warfare between China and Japan. A spokesman for the Chinese delegation stated that China has always abided by the League of Nations Covenant while resisting aggression. Yuguan is clearly within Chinese territory, and the attempt to recover it is no different in nature from the Shanghai war last spring, and is by no means offensive. The Chinese feel that this city must be recovered, so they are prepared to make the greatest sacrifices to achieve this goal. (Reuters dispatch, 12th) (Geneva) The representatives of both China and Japan are now silent, which is quite strange. Some people even regard this silence as an ominous sign of an impending storm. The Chinese side here expressed the opinion that the important developments hereafter may come from the Far East. The Chinese are showing signs of impatience with the League of Nations' repeated delays, but judging from the Chinese's past endurance, everyone expects them to wait patiently for the results of the meeting of the Nineteen-Member Special Committee. It is now known here that the British's recent attempt to bring China and Japan together to resolve the Yuguan case on the spot has failed. (Reuters dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>Rome After Matsuoka arrived in Italy, he described the Sino-Japanese dispute to Prime Minister Mussolini and other major politicians. Now it has been made public. This trip has created a good impression and allowed Japan to personally contact the European countries dealing with the Sino-Japanese dispute. Italy's response is that this case should be adjudicated by the League of Nations.</p>
<p>Many believe that the League of Nations is now at a critical juncture. All newspapers have published news about the Manchurian Incident in many pages, but without commentary. (Reuters dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The week beginning January 16 will be the most critical period in the discussion of the Sino-Japanese dispute in Geneva.</p>
<p>In the days leading up to the meeting of the Nineteen-Member Special Committee on the 16th, it will become clear whether the efforts of League of Nations Secretary-General Drummond and Nineteen-Member Special Committee Chairman Hymans, who were ordered during the recess to contact both sides to find a mutually acceptable solution, will be successful. If the efforts of these two are successful, then the draft resolution of the Nineteen-Member Special Committee can be announced, and the League of Nations General Assembly may convene as early as possible to decide whether to request the United States and Russia to participate in the conciliation procedure, and to decide what form the conciliation committee should take. The Conciliation Committee is not necessarily the entire Nineteen-Member Special Committee. In addition to the possible participation of the United States and Russia, its number will be smaller and composed of representatives of major countries with interests in the Far East. No formal invitations have yet been sent to the United States and Russia. It is reported that the League of Nations has already inquired about their opinions, but has not yet received concrete results. If the Nineteen-Member Special Committee cannot agree on a solution when it meets, then the League of Nations General Assembly will inevitably prepare a report in accordance with Article 15, Paragraph 4 of the League of Nations Covenant. This report will roughly adopt the outline of the Lytton Report, or use it in its entirety, or use its first eight chapters as a basis and slightly revise its recommendations. (Reuters dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Hymans, Chairman of the Nineteen-Nation Special Committee, is scheduled to arrive here on the 13th. He will meet with Drummond on the 14th to discuss a compromise plan. Japanese representative Matsuoka returned from Italy at 6:00 p.m. today.</p>
<p>He had a secret conversation with Sugimura for more than an hour. It is reported that what was discussed was the Sugimura-Drummond compromise plan. Regarding the Yuguan case, the Japanese side is making great efforts to spread an atmosphere of peaceful resolution. Because our side ignores it, the future of the League of Nations is still bleak. It is reported that all the Chinese representatives have gathered in Geneva and will express their views on the atmosphere of peaceful resolution spread by the Japanese side. (China United News Agency dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to Japanese sources, Yosuke Matsuoka returned to Geneva at 6:00 p.m. yesterday and met with Dr. Sugimura at 10:00 p.m. for about one hour and twenty minutes. It is reported that Sugimura and Drummond have reached a new proposal, the content of which is as follows: 1. The issue of the independence of "Manchukuo" should not be mentioned in the resolution and should be reserved for future proposals, glossing over it to satisfy Japan's desires. 2. The powers of the Mediation Committee should not be limited and can be freely expanded or contracted in a timely manner. It should be organized by seven countries: China, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, and Belgium. If a small country objects, then another country should be selected from the small countries to organize it, with the aim of promoting a resolution from the sidelines. 3. The issue of the participation of the United States and Russia should be left to Japan's discretion and should not be mentioned. 4. The principle of mediating the Sino-Japanese dispute should respect the actual situation. The Lytton Report can only be used as a reference. However, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs has not made any criticism of this. The diplomatic community speculates that if this plan is established,</p>
<p>then the facts will be very different from what China advocates. Although Japan accepts it, the Sino-Japanese dispute cannot be easily resolved. (China United Press dispatch, 12th)</p>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>What Will Be Our Final Determination?</h3>
<p>Since the Japanese have repeatedly invaded, our people have been thoroughly educated. When they first launch an attack, they must first fabricate an excuse, saying that the Chinese army opened fire first. After the launch, they will say that this is a local incident. If China slightly mobilizes its troops to increase its defenses, it is challenging Japan. They also often say to people in peacetime that they are willing to resolve matters between China and Japan with China. If we negotiate with them, they must find an excuse, saying that China has no sincerity in negotiation. If we file a protest, they either ignore it or give a barbaric and unreasonable reply. If we appeal to the League of Nations, then the Japanese will surely declare loudly:</p>
<p>This is not something that a third party can interfere with. If the League of Nations slightly inquires, then they will threaten to withdraw from the League of Nations or use various words to delay the matter. The Japanese have pre-arranged this kind of plan. Every time they launch a military action, they use this method to deal with China, so that after each time we are slaughtered, our army does not dare to move a single inch, our borders do not dare to set up a defense, our diplomacy cannot display any strategy, and even the League of Nations cannot open its mouth. If we show a slight resistance, they will surely use our people's fear of war to intimidate us, saying: Fight, fight! If we want to avoid war, we will endure and delay, then they will just take advantage of this delay to reorganize the land they have occupied, arrange for further plans, and come again with a local incident. The Japanese design is like this. May I ask how much land China has? If we endure once, the Japanese will step up and accelerate their progress once. They can always fabricate excuses and create local incidents anywhere. As the ancients said, "They will not give up until they reach the Yellow River." The Japanese ambition to swallow us will not stop at the Yellow River. Therefore, if we continue to endure, the entire China will become a local incident. I am afraid that the country will be destroyed soon in a fight to the death.</p>
<p>Recently, people discussing the international situation often worry that a major war in the Pacific is not far away, saying that when the opportunity for a major war in the Pacific arrives,</p>
<p>that is, when the time for our country to be in danger of destruction arrives, and loudly warn our general youth and people to premeditate a plan for a united and consistent effort to save our nation from imminent danger. However, judging from the previous situation, the time for our nation to be in danger of destruction need not wait until the day of the future Pacific War, but is now when the Japanese army is gradually approaching. Our national youth and people should immediately plan a united and consistent effort to save our nation from danger, and they cannot be as calm and leisurely as preparing for the Pacific War, but should work hard and courageously to move forward by combining days and nights. Because the Japanese have forced us into a corner, we can only rise up and fight to the death to fight for a way out.</p>
<p>Moreover, our rising up and fighting to the death is also what their country fears. Therefore, after each act of aggression, they must show some moderation.</p>
<p>It is not moderation. On the one hand, they use peace to entice and neglect the hearts of our people. On the other hand, they temporarily calm down to observe the actions of our people.</p>
<p>and determine their advancing policy. If we do not fight, they can gradually advance, without sacrifice, without labor, and obtain the entire territory of China.</p>
<p>If we fight to the death, then even if they win and obtain our entire territory, the sacrifice will be very great and their national strength will be very exhausted. If we do not fight, they can use the land they have occupied as a basis to calmly prepare for a major war in the Pacific. If we fight to the death, then they will be exhausted by the war in our country. Once the war clouds in the Pacific rise, they will inevitably be powerless to cope. Therefore, today they are using our fear of war to scare us with war, which is precisely because they themselves fear war and are using false voices to scare us into not fighting. If we continue to delay and go along with their convenience and avoid what they fear, or seek temporary peace and easily make peace, then we are falling into the enemy's trap, which is by no means a good strategy.</p>
<p>Because the situation is so tense, we want to calmly plan a plan to save the country from the root, or another way to win,</p>
<p>or seek a way to save ourselves through compromise, or seek help from neighboring countries through diplomacy. Not only can it not be done, but it is already too late. War is not something that can be easily spoken of, nor is it easy to speak of. Placing all our bets on one throw is especially feared by the people of the country. However, after carefully weighing the pros and cons and examining the enemy's situation, there is absolutely no room for us to hesitate and watch. The government authorities should quickly make a final determination.</p>
<p>The people of the whole country should quickly determine a plan for a united struggle.</p>

We are suffering, but they will definitely not benefit. Now the League of Nations has no ability to sanction. We can only work together from top to bottom and resist for a long time, and we will eventually achieve the final victory. (Special dispatch on the 12th)</p>

<h3>The German Social Democratic Party is Breaking Apart</h3>
<p>A Close Aide of Hitler Announces His Departure from the Party</p>
<p>The Party has Financial Difficulties and Borrows Heavily</p>
<p>Havas Electric News from Munich, Germany on the 12th: Louberck, a close aide of Hitler, has been abroad and is currently on bad terms with the Social Democratic Party Congressman Goebbels, and has left the party.</p>
<p>Havas Electric News from Berlin on the 11th: Hitler's stay in Berlin is probably due to the financial difficulties of the party. It is reported that Hitler has signed a contract with a Swedish banking group to borrow heavily by mortgaging all the party's real estate. This loan was arranged in advance by the Speaker of the House, the Social Democratic Party member Grlin, during his recent visit to Sweden. The organ of the former important Social Democratic Party member Audus Tolasse, "A Black Front," said that Prime Minister Schleicher seemed to have suggested to Hitler that if Hitler was willing to be the Deputy Prime Minister of the Cabinet, then his party's debts would be cleared by him. The report also said that the Social Democratic Party owed as much as four million to five million marks. Combining these two pieces of news, it can be seen that if Schleicher truly invited Hitler to be the Deputy Prime Minister, Hitler would not be able to accept it unconditionally.</p>

<h3>The Second Five-Year Plan is Implemented Vigorously in Soviet Russia</h3>
<p>Harsh Laws and Severe Punishments for Workers</p>
<p>Purging Party Members and Eradicating Vagrants</p>
<p>Moscow News: The great cause of completing the Soviet Union's Five-Year Plan in four years has now reached its peak. Although there are still some unfinished points in the entire plan, the "production of means of production" and the development of heavy industry, which are the main objectives of the plan, have largely overcome the difficulties. In the industrial sector, the achievements in the development and manufacturing of coal, oil, electricity, tractors, and general machinery have far exceeded the initial projections. The two formerly cold villages of Bird Jinglai and Ural have recently been transformed into the latest industrial cities. As for the metal, transportation, textile, chemical, and other sectors, they are still far from the enrichment line and require continued efforts. As for the achievements in the agricultural economy, in the Soviet Union, 65% of individual agriculture has shifted to collective agriculture, and there is also the establishment of a state-owned agricultural people's committee. However, due to the incompleteness of the distribution of materials in rural areas, farmers tend to concentrate in cities, and agricultural products are also insufficient. This also requires future efforts.</p>
<p>Absence for one day Suspension from work The second five-year plan aims to create a classless society in the Soviet Union and make its economy completely independent of capitalist countries. In order to increase the efficiency of the second five-year plan, the authorities have recently made labor regulations even stricter than before, and the penalties for workers' laziness are extremely strict. Even if a worker is absent for only one day, if there is no good reason, he will be immediately dismissed, and a notice will be posted to confiscate his house and stop his food rations. In the past, people's bread collection certificates were issued by residential administrators, but after this, they will be directly issued by factories and government offices. In this way, the dismissed person will of course have no bread to collect from that day on. Also, workers who are late five times during the work period will be counted as one day of absenteeism. Therefore, the workers who take the tram on the streets of Moscow are scrambling to get on the train, as if they are crazy. The New Year's Day of this year was also not a holiday, and the authorities issued a strict announcement against laziness. Those who steal hooks shall be Put to death. Furthermore, in rural areas, the authorities, in view of the frequent theft of crops from collective and state-owned farms, have now issued a strict order that anyone who commits a crime in the future shall be executed. Someone was executed after stealing seven bags of potatoes.</p>
<p>Implement this year The most Second Purge Recently, the authorities conducted a major cleanup of more than two million Communist Party members, and plan to conduct the second major liquidation since the formation of the Russian Communist Party this year (1933). It was also decided to suspend the recruitment of new party members for one year this year.</p>
<p>Unemployed vagrants expelled from the city Moreover, this cleaning campaign is not limited to party members, but also applies to the general public. On December 28 last year, a decree was issued to start a major cleaning campaign of the general public in major cities, starting with Moscow. All non-social members without a fixed occupation and parasites who do not work for food will be expelled from the city. The method of implementation is to implement a military travel voucher system throughout Russia. Anyone who has not registered for employment and does not have a travel voucher is not qualified to live in the city, and the authorities will force them to work in rural areas. Also, those without travel vouchers are not allowed to enter the city. This law can prevent a large number of farmers from concentrating in cities, regulate overpopulation, and completely eliminate non-social members.</p>

<p>Still groaning under the "recession?" Families below the middle class are already living from hand to mouth, starving after eating a meal. They can only entrust their hopes for the future to a vague fate, and let the Araki faction of bright mercury-like warlords use "five elements," "yin and yang," and "ganzhi" to say that this year (1933) will be a year of great success.</p>
<p>Let's take an example of deep panic. Kyoto Imperial University professors are considered the best of the knowledge world. Dr. Kawakami Hajime is especially an authority in the current Japanese economics world and a first-class scholar in the study of Marxism. His works are published and there is a great demand for them. He is especially famous for teaching in the Department of Economics at Kyoto Imperial University. However, because the right-wing movement has risen, Dr. Kawakami was forced to resign from his teaching position. After leaving the research room, he entered the real society. He once joined the Labor-Farmer Party and advocated the non-Taifa movement, which aroused the sympathy of many Japanese youths. Since the September 18th Incident, the military sword has commanded everything, and not only the left-wing movement has suffered severe oppression, but also the capitalists and liberals. If they publicly advocate "democratic politics," they will inevitably be killed. Even the "freedom of research" that was previously allowed has been completely deprived by force. Therefore, Dr. Kawakami was not tolerated by the military and the various right-wing groups commanded by the military. After May of last year, he said he was traveling abroad,</p>
<p>But he has since disappeared. Some people say he secretly went to Russia, and some say he is no longer alive. But according to the usual situation,</p>
<p>The Kawakami family can still live on his royalties.</p>
<p>After all, it cannot be supported. Kawakami's second daughter also has no tuition fees, so he had to ask his friends to introduce her to work as a typist to barely eke out a poor life. Middle-class and above families are still like this, then only nobles and capitalists can maintain a life above the horizontal line.</p>
<p>Then what is his problem? Since Japan abandoned the gold standard in December of the year before last, in the first half of last year, its foreign exchange rate, although low, did not seriously affect daily life. General prices were still falling, and there was not much stimulus to export trade. Therefore, the export trade in the first half of the year was only 54 million yen, a decrease of 20 million yen compared with the same period of the previous year. However, from July to the end of December, commodity exports amounted to 850 million yen, an increase of 290 million yen compared with the same period of the previous year. This superficially prosperous situation can be said to be unparalleled in the world. However, since the summer of last year, its hard currency reserves have gradually decreased. At the end of the year, Japan's cash is probably worth no more than 420 million yen. Therefore, the credit of Japanese currency is low in international exchange rates. The exchange rate against the US dollar has fallen from the usual value of 49.5 US cents per yen to 20 US dollars in November last year. According to recent observations, it is feared that it will fall below 20 US dollars. Therefore, we know that the current prosperity of Japan is a trick made with inconvertible paper money. Because the lower the value of the currency, the higher the price will be relatively. If the foreign exchange rate falls by 60%, the price will also rise by 60%. Although prices have risen, the credibility of the Japanese yen has been seriously injured. Moreover, the number of convertible notes issued by the Bank of Japan had increased to 1.5 billion yen by the end of last year. At the beginning of this year, it hurriedly exchanged more than 100 million yen worth of debt securities to avoid too many paper currencies and cause the entire national economy to shake.</p>
<p>As everyone knows, the Japanese warlords have long been prepared to further use military force to solve everything. Taking advantage of the handover of the Second Division, they transferred the Sixth Division to Manchuria. According to special information from a certain source, the Japanese troops gathered in Jinzhou, Suizhong, Shanhaiguan, Chaoyang Temple, and Beipiao include the entire Eighth Division originally stationed in Jinzhou, the entire Sixth Division newly transferred from Kumamoto, the entire Fourteenth Division transferred from Shanghai to Manchuria, and a part of the Second Cavalry Brigade. They are gathering at Yuguan and the border of Rehe, preparing to attack Rehe and the eastern five counties. Therefore, the condition he proposed for a neutral zone west of Shanhaiguan to Chuzhou is a common trick of Japanese militarism: opening up land to the outside world, stimulating people's hearts at home, and shifting the attention of the people in other countries from the economic panic. I don't know if the compatriots and authorities in the motherland have seen through his trick and immediately stood up to fight him. (January 6, 1933, Tokyo)</p>

<h3>The Situation on the Chinese Eastern Railway After the Retreat of Su Bingwen's Army</h3>
<p>Japanese Occupation Slogans Posted Along the Railway Line</p>
<p>Hailar Station Protected by Mongolian Soldiers</p>
<p>A dispatch from the Harbin correspondent of the North-China Daily News, dated December 23rd, states that the Chinese Eastern Railway from Harbin to Manchouli in the west is now open to traffic, allowing travelers to pass through and witness the local situation. The reasons for the rapid retreat of Su Bingwen's troops are being investigated. It is certain that the Japanese army transported a large force northwards via the Siping-Taonan and Taonan-Angangxi railways. After they were fully deployed on the front lines near Fularji, they launched a fierce attack on the Chinese army, forcing them to retreat. According to what the reporter heard in Zhalantun, the Japanese army launched a simultaneous pincer attack on the Chinese troops stationed on the mountain peaks of Zhalantun, with continuous artillery fire followed by aerial bombing. Zhalantun is a famous area in northern Manchuria, located in the mountains and serving as the gateway to the Greater Khingan Range. The Chinese army, unable to withstand the artillery fire, abandoned all their supplies and fled. The Japanese army then advanced rapidly in pursuit, so swiftly that the Chinese army had little chance to damage the railway. Even if the Chinese army had planted mines in the Greater Khingan tunnel, they retreated so hastily that they did not have time to ignite the detonators. As the Chinese troops quickly retreated towards the Russian border, the Japanese army was able to advance unimpeded. After passing Zhalantun, they encountered no further resistance. Currently, travelers heading west from Harbin, after passing Anda, will see a strange phenomenon: all the telegraph poles along the railway line are covered with paper slips, bearing a Rising Sun flag at the top and the Japanese words "Japanese Occupation" at the bottom. There are no "Manchukuo" flags along the way, nor any indication that the Japanese army is acting on behalf of "Manchukuo" to clear the area.</p>
<p>However, according to a Russian in Zhalantun, the Japanese suffered heavy casualties when they first attacked the Chinese troops at Fularji and Hulun Ergi, with at least a thousand killed or wounded. This may be true, as just ten days ago, a Japanese ship arrived in Kobe carrying 324 boxes of cremated remains of Japanese soldiers, undoubtedly those who died on the battlefield in northern Manchuria. When the reporter arrived in Hailar, the station was being guarded by Mongolian soldiers, who are employed by "Manchukuo".</p>
<p>According to their commander, the railway protection troops are now entirely composed of Mongolians and Buryats (note: the Buryats are a Mongolian ethnic group near Lake Baikal), with no Han Chinese, as the Japanese have absolutely no trust in the Han Chinese. The town of Hailar has not been damaged, and business seems to be maintaining its normal state, but food is extremely scarce and expensive. A whole sheep costs four silver dollars, and meat costs twelve cents per pound. The reporter heard in Hailar that a unit of Japanese soldiers, fully equipped for winter, had departed from the town, presumably heading towards the Mongolian border. It is not known what their purpose is. Several Japanese merchants in the town claimed that a week before Su Bingwen's retreat, they had personally seen Ma Zhanshan talking to him. They had often seen Ma Zhanshan in the capital of Longjiang Province and knew him well.</p>
<p>They were certain that the person seen in Hailar was indeed Ma Zhanshan. It is said that when Ma Zhanshan left Hailar, he said that he would ask Zhang Xueliang in Beiping to allocate aircraft, hoping to return to Hailar in a month. Currently, the route between Harbin and Manchouli is peaceful. The Soviet authorities in Siberia are planning to resume the Trans-Siberian Express to Manchouli. The first train from Moscow is scheduled to arrive in Manchouli on the 26th. European mail is currently being transshipped from Chita Station eastward. Traffic between Manchuria and Europe, which had been closed, is now reopening. In the future, the Harbin "Manchukuo" Post Office may be able to adequately handle its duties. However, its staff currently lacks sufficient experience. Regarding the Chinese Eastern Railway, the Russian and "Manchukuo" directors have been meeting almost daily to discuss various issues. It is expected that there will be many reforms after the New Year.</p>
<h3>Zhang Xueliang's Interview with the Press</h3>
<p>International Peace Movement Has Become a Bubble</p>
<p>Only with Spirit and Blood to Protect the Motherland</p>
<p>Beiping Correspondence: At 10:30 AM on the 8th, Zhang Xueliang, Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission, hosted a reception for the Chinese and foreign press in Beiping, attended by more than 60 people. Li Yingchao served as the English interpreter and Chen Yamu as the French interpreter. The details of Zhang's speech are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>"Today, I have invited everyone to discuss my thoughts in response to your questions. Since the September 18th Incident, I have often pondered whether to conclude the matter peacefully or allow the situation to escalate. After careful consideration, I decided to conclude it through reasonable peaceful means. This is because a peaceful resolution would benefit not only China and Japan but also the entire world. It is not only my personal wish but also the desire of key figures in the central government, who all embrace this approach of seeking compromise.</p>
<p>At the same time, I also considered that if the situation escalated, leading to an unavoidable conflict between the two countries, it would not only be a misfortune for China and Japan but would also shatter the international peace guarantees achieved after the European War. The impact would be truly significant and far-reaching. I also believe that this concept of peace is not only shared by the Chinese but also by many far-sighted politicians in Japan. Therefore, despite the violent actions against Japan within the country, the peace movement has been underway. The writings of Japanese politician Yukio Ozaki can be considered representative, and there are many like-minded Japanese who embrace the idea of peace. Unfortunately, they have ultimately been sacrificed by violent elements. Several great politicians and prominent figures have already fallen victim. From the time of the incident until today, China's desire for peace, the desire of Japanese peace advocates, and the international peace movement have all become a bubble. The Japanese side, however, after each escalation of the situation, boasts of its love for peace and blames the Chinese side for the breakdown of peace. However, the facts before and after clearly prove otherwise. Let me discuss the recent facts. In the recent Shanhaiguan Incident, the Japanese side accused the Chinese side of mobilizing troops. I ask, can the troops of their country move freely and recklessly within the borders of another country, yet criticize the troops of the other country for their actions within their own borders? Is there any reason for this? Moreover, China's mobilization of troops is purely to prevent further aggression. Should this right of self-defense be taken away?</p>
<p>Some time ago, a Japanese person asked me why China mobilized troops. I answered him directly based on this and offered an analogy. If someone feels insecure in their environment and hires guards to protect them or closes their doors for defense, and then someone who intends to harm them claims that they should not be protected and should not close their doors for defense, wouldn't that be unreasonable? I also recall an incident when the League of Nations investigation team was on its way back to Beiping after visiting Shanhaiguan. The Japanese side suddenly hoisted Japanese and puppet flags at the station as their train passed through. The Chinese and foreign members of the delegation were greatly astonished. Members of my train escort team, in indignation, wanted to rush forward and tear them down, but a key member of the investigation team stopped them, saying that he had witnessed this and knew that the Japanese side had always harbored provocative intentions towards Shanhaiguan. Thus, the Japanese intentions were known to everyone. Today, after seizing Shanhaiguan, they fabricated a cause, falsely claiming that our army provoked them. Who would believe that? I am reminded of the various treaty constraints that China has suffered because of the Shanhaiguan Incident. The Japanese side readily invokes treaties as a shield when they are advantageous to them, even citing abrogated treaties. However, when treaties are not beneficial to them, they blatantly disregard them. For example, the current incident in Shanhaiguan occurred because the Japanese were allowed to station troops there. In short, the Japanese side can unilaterally invoke treaties to their advantage, while our side suffers greatly from them. At the beginning of the Shanhaiguan Incident, the Japanese side attributed the outbreak of hostilities to the Chinese side throwing bombs.</p>
<p>Regardless of who threw the bomb, I ask, should throwing a small bomb justify a large-scale attack and the capture of a city? This kind of unreasonable excuse and deliberate escalation of the situation is exactly like the Liutiao Lake Incident on September 18th. Comparing this case with that one, it will become clear who threw the bomb. Someone asked me who provoked the Shanhaiguan Incident and how it would be resolved. I replied with a smile that if they wanted to get to the root of the matter, another investigation team could be sent by the League of Nations to investigate. As for how to resolve it, the power lies entirely in the hands of those who occupy the city. In short, the Shanhaiguan issue is the same as the Northeast issue. They should return what they have taken in the same way they took it. The Japanese have claimed in the League of Nations that even if the Northeast were to be returned to China, they would never return it to Zhang Xueliang, and that Zhang Xueliang would not be allowed to let any other Chinese troops enter the Northeast. The Japanese side is entirely targeting me personally regarding their aggression against China. Attacking China with the strength of the entire nation is equivalent to attacking me alone. They seem to think that all the troubles between China and Japan are caused by me alone, so they deeply resent me. If that is the case, then I would become the sole great figure in Chinese history. However, I would not dare to accept that. You must know that Zhang Xueliang is just a member of the Chinese army, a member serving the country, and a member who loves the country just like any other Chinese. I ask, how could Zhang Xueliang not allow other Chinese troops to enter the Northeast? The Japanese also claim that the "Manchukuo" cannot be abolished because of the Japanese side's need to save face. But when comparing face with the lives of the country and its people, which is more important? Now, our country's efforts to seek compromise have been ineffective, and the world's efforts to maintain peace have also been ineffective. Today, we can only use our spirit and blood to protect our motherland and uphold justice. I also anticipate that in a few days, the Japanese side will claim that the Sino-Japanese issue cannot be resolved peacefully because Zhang is obstructing it, or that China has decided to go to war. But have they ever thought about who forced the Chinese to make this decision? If the Japanese side truly loves peace, then peace can be achieved immediately. The Chinese are completely in a passive position. Someone asked me what the Japanese military's intentions are in invading China. I find this question difficult to answer. I believe that everyone should consider the benefits before taking action. Since the Japanese military occupied the Northeast, have they gained any benefits? Even if the Japanese side places all the blame on me and wants to eliminate me, I am only a weak member of the country. There are countless people stronger than me. If I were removed, those who succeed me would be even stronger. You must know that what the Japanese seek is our blood. Not only can I not give it to them, but no one else can either. Today, they are focusing their resentment on me, perhaps forgetting that resisting Japan is the shared responsibility of all Chinese people. A foreign friend in attendance asked,</p>
<p>"Protecting China is the responsibility of the Chinese government and the Chinese people, but what can we do to help?" I remember a Japanese friend coming to China and asking me, "We only hear about the Chinese side's unreasonable actions in our country, so the Japanese government has repeatedly used force against China. But when I came to China, what I saw was completely different." From this, we can see that the people in Japan are completely ignorant of the truth of the Japanese invasion of China and are purely blinded by violent elements. I hope that journalists from friendly countries will regularly publish the true news of the Sino-Japanese incident to the world and within Japan, so that the people of that country will not be forever paralyzed by these violent elements and will realize that the invasion of China is wrong. At the same time, I also hope that you will tell the truth completely when reporting on the Sino-Japanese incident, because public opinion is the primary weapon for upholding justice. If we can harness the power of public opinion, I and justice will surely prevail one day." At this point, the interview ended. A foreign journalist asked about China's military actions. Zhang replied, "What has happened in the past, you should already understand. As for the future, I cannot tell you." He was also asked if China was determined to resist. Zhang replied that whether China resists</p>
<p>depends on the Japanese side, whether they invade or not. (9th)</p>
<h3>Farmers from Outside the Pass Return to Their Native Places in Droves</h3>
<p>Japanese Warlords Cause Unrest</p>
<p>Over 30,000 People Have Passed Through in Recent Days</p>
<p>Qingdao Correspondence: Because of the overpopulation of Shandong Province, hundreds of thousands of people go to the three northeastern provinces every year to make a living. Since the September 18th Incident, they have been subjected to the ravages of Japanese warlords, and many dare not go there. Even the merchants and residents who were originally in the Northeast are being slaughtered by the Japanese and cannot live in peace. They are leading their elders and children back to their hometowns. Therefore, in recent days, the number of farmers returning to their native places from the Northeast via Qingdao has been exceptionally large. All the ships imported from Dalian are full. These farmers, in addition to a portion taking ships from Xiaogang to places such as Shijiusuo and Haizhou, mostly take Jiaozhou Railway trains west. The Jiaozhou Railway authorities, out of consideration, have specially added a freight car, charging half the fare, exclusively for those returning from the three northeastern provinces. It is stipulated that the train departs from Qingdao to the west at 8:30 every evening. However, because the number of people is too large, the added cars cannot accommodate them, and those who cannot get on the train have to wait at the station, waiting for the next day. Because the freight cars are insufficient, the Jiaozhou Railway has ordered the No. 46 Machinery Factory to quickly repair the third-class passenger cars stored in the factory for use. It is said that these cars</p>
<p>were all repaired yesterday, so that there will be no overcrowding for farmers going west in the future. According to news from the wharf, from December 25th to January 9th, nearly 30,000 people have come to Qingdao by ship from Dalian. The names of the ships and the number of people they carried, as well as the dates of arrival in Qingdao, are listed below:</p>
<p>Ship Name Number of Passengers Arrival Date in Qingdao</p>

<h3>Gao You Tang Impeaches Zheng Yuxiu</h3>
<p>Inspector Gao You Tang's impeachment of Zheng Yuxiu is as follows: Regarding the impeachment matter, according to Zhang Zhiping, a resident of Shanghai, accusing Yang Zhaoyan, the President of the Shanghai Special District Court, and Zheng Yuxiu, the former Chief of the Shanghai Local Court,</p>
<p>of colluding to commit illegal and greedy acts. You Tang went to Shanghai to conduct an on-the-spot investigation. Although public opinion was unanimous and the collusion and corruption of Yang and Zheng were mentioned with certainty, it was still necessary to obtain evidence. First, regarding the section of misrepresentation, he went to the local court to collect the archives and registers and checked them one by one. Upon examining the dates on the register of funds deposited and withdrawn by the parties involved, there were traces of alteration. Upon further investigation, it was discovered that some funds had been paid out twice. Initially, it was thought to be an occasional oversight, but upon detailed examination, there were as many as 22 cases of double payments: (1) In the mortgage case between Lu Zhixun and Banshiguo Zhang Yongkui, 1,950 yuan was paid on December 1, 15, 1,500 yuan was withdrawn on December 14, and 450 yuan was withdrawn on January 11, 16. On June 24, 16, 1,500 yuan was paid out again, and on September 9, 450 yuan was paid out again. (2) In the debt repayment case between Hu Desen and Yao Dehe, 440.50 yuan was paid on November 25, 15, and the full amount was withdrawn on December 7. On October 21, 16, the same amount was paid out again. (3) In the demolition case between Dai Shanquiao and Ling Maoquan, 499.50 yuan was paid on October 16, 15, and the full amount was withdrawn on October 26. On November 8, 16, the same amount was paid out again. (4) In the debt case between Jiang Maoquan and Luo Huaishan, 800 yuan was paid on May 3, 15, and the full amount was withdrawn on October 8. On November 13, 16, the same amount was paid out again. (5) In the debt case between Zhu Zhaoyuan and Zhao Xiaolin, 1,475 yuan was paid on May 18, 15, and 1,465.142 yuan was withdrawn on October 26. On November 8, 16, 1,465.142 yuan was paid out again. (6) In the funds case between Xu Yuqi and Tong Ji, 2,431.92 yuan was paid on August 27, 15, and the full amount was withdrawn on September 28. On November 8, 16, the same amount was paid out again. (7) In the funds case between Yan Zhangshi and Yan Zhangfu, 277.284 yuan was paid on November 15, 15, and the full amount was withdrawn on November 26. On October 25, 16, the same amount was paid out again. (8) In the goods case between Shen Jinpu and Zheng Hongqing, 961.208 yuan was paid on November 15, 15, and the full amount was withdrawn on November 26. On September 23, 16, the same amount was paid out again. (9) In the funds case between Hu Jing and Sun Yishan, 611.67 yuan was paid on January 31, 16, and the full amount was withdrawn on February 1. On September 20, 16, the same amount was paid out again. (10) In the property case between Cheng Guanyuan and Cheng Xiuming,</p>
<p>1,254.36 yuan was paid on January 17, 16, and the full amount was withdrawn on January 25. On September 16, 16, the same amount was paid out again. (11) In the mortgage case between Chen Kanglu and Xu Shiyun,</p>
<p>1,000 yuan was paid on October 7, 15, and the full amount was withdrawn on December 3.</p>
<p>On August 5, 16, the same amount was paid out again. (12) In the base case between Qiao Zhixiang and Zhang Yuan, 240 yuan was paid on November 29, 15, and the full amount was withdrawn on December 24. On October 21, 16, the same amount was paid out again. (13) In the mortgage case between Qian Meiling and Gu Ziqin, 796 yuan was paid on December 9, 15, and the full amount was withdrawn on December 12. On September 6, 16, the same amount was paid out again. (14) In the debt case between Zhao Guifen and Hong Ziyu, 685 yuan was paid on November 19, 15, and the full amount was withdrawn on December 3. On September 6, 16, the same amount was paid out again. (15) In the loan case between He Dade and Zhang Pu, 752 yuan was paid on December 1, 15, and the full amount was withdrawn on December 24. On August 16, 16, the same amount was paid out again. (16) In the property case between Jin Zhiyi and Jin Zhi, 470 yuan was paid on December 2, 15, and the full amount was withdrawn on December 14. On June 17, 16, the same amount was paid out again. (17) In the mortgage case between Zhao Chengqing and Gong Yunqing, 750 yuan was paid on December 15, 15, 500 yuan was paid on December 24, and the full amount was withdrawn on January 14, 16. On September 13 of the same year, the same amount was paid out. (18) In the account case between Pan Xingkui and Zhou Jinfu, 470 yuan was paid on November 12, 15, and the full amount was withdrawn on November 23. On June 3, 16, the same amount was paid out again. (19) In the loan case between Yu Zibin and Lian Zhihao, 500 yuan was paid on December 10, 15, and the full amount was withdrawn on December 28. On the 9th of the month, 16, the same amount was paid out again. (20) In the land sale case between Gong Gen and Gong Fugeng, 350 yuan was paid on December 2, 15, and the full amount was withdrawn on December 14.</p>
<p>On the 17th of the month, 16, the same amount was paid out again. (21) In the debt case between Zhang Shuntang and Zhang Yunzhi, 862 yuan was paid on October 29, 15, and 3,452 yuan was paid on November 5 of the same year. On November 26 of the same year, 4,293.47 yuan was withdrawn. On September 27, 16, 845.47 yuan was paid out again, and on November 4 of the same year, another 3,418 yuan was paid out. (22) In the debt case between Xu Tingzuo and Zhalei Paofu, 9,704.17 yuan was paid on December 18, 15, and Zhalei withdrew 8,704.17 yuan on December 7 of the same year, leaving 1,000 yuan withdrawn. On September 30, 16, 1,000 yuan was paid out again. The total amount of double payments is 22,502.144 yuan. The receipt is stamped with Zheng Yuxiu's seal and the seal of the chief clerk Niu Fuchun. After the handover, it was stamped by Zheng Huichen, the accounting director of Yang Zhaoyan, who is the younger sister of Zheng Yuxiu and the concubine of Yang Zhaoyan. The evidence of their joint fraud is conclusive. Yang Zhaoyan, upon succeeding as President of the Shanghai Local Court, inherited the responsibility of liquidation from Zheng Yuxiu, but he did not report the embezzlement of more than 22,000 yuan,</p>
<p>indicating that Zheng dared to engage in fraud, paying out funds twice, setting a bad example in the judicial system.</p>
<p>Yang Zhaoyan shielded her, suggesting that he helped her. This should be impeached as the first point. Whether there is a deficit can be determined by whether the amount of funds deposited in the bank matches the amount of funds listed in the register. You Tang repeatedly sent letters to Yang and Zheng requesting the bank statements, but Shen Bingqian, the current President of the Local Court,</p>
<p>claimed that they had not been transferred. Later, according to Yang Zhaoyan's letter, he did not create a bank statement during his tenure, and Zheng had not transferred the aforementioned records before, so he had sent a letter to former Chief Zheng to investigate and send them. These excuses are unreasonable. Judicial income should be deposited in the bank acting as the national treasury, as the Ministry of Justice had already issued a notice. If there was no transaction with the bank, where was the public money? Moreover, upon reviewing the handover register, it was clearly listed that Yang Zhaoyan had received the bank statement. Since there is a record of receipt, why was it not transferred to the successor? It is evident that there must be a discrepancy between the bank statement and the handover register, and they dared not hand it over, indicating that Yang Zhaoyan had concealed evidence related to another person's criminal case, without a doubt. This should be impeached as the second point. Zheng Yuxiu's predecessor was Shen Xiqing. Shen handed over to Zheng, and the register listed an interest income of 7,069 yuan. Zheng was in office for eight months, and each month the funds deposited by the parties involved always amounted to 40,000 to 50,000 yuan, not including the income from the sale of stamps and fines. However, at the time of the handover, there was no interest income whatsoever. Yang Zhaoyan was in office for two and a half years, and at the time of the handover, only a little over 200 yuan was listed as interest income. What is even stranger is that the 7,069 yuan in interest that Shen Xiqing handed over to Zheng Yuxiu, Zheng Yuxiu handed over to Yang Zhaoyan, and Yang Zhaoyan handed over to Shen Bingqian,</p>
<p>had been carried over for more than three years. The handover register still listed it as 7,069 yuan. Then, was there no compound interest in these two years? It is evident that Zheng and Yang embezzled the interest,</p>
<p>which is very obvious. This should be impeached as the third point. The three points listed above constitute crimes under Articles 357 and 175 of the Criminal Law. According to Article 140 of the Criminal Law, the original penalty should be increased by one-sixth, with no room for leniency. Upon investigation, Zheng Yuxiu, since leaving office, has been working as a lawyer in Shanghai, handling litigation cases single-handedly, doing whatever she wants, initially turning white into black,</p>
<p>and then creating something out of nothing. If civil cases cannot be detained, then she uses false attachments to intimidate. Criminal cases do not inquire about the truth or falsehood, but as long as there is an accusation, she uses detention to intimidate, all as tools for defrauding money or coercing settlements. The money she has defrauded,</p>
<p>is said to be in the millions of yuan. Although there are some self-respecting individuals who uphold justice, they are promptly demoted to lower positions, and those without integrity all bow their heads and obey her command. For a time, there was a rumor in the court that "a doctor is here to intimidate," which is a true account. Over the years, the people of Shanghai have suffered from Zheng Yuxiu's evil influence, with many families ruined and many committing suicide in grievance. The morals of society have been undermined, and the integrity of the court has been tarnished, all thanks to Zheng Yuxiu, Yang Zhaoyan, and others. Although bribery is rampant, evidence is difficult to obtain, and the people suffer and have no way to complain, so Zheng and Yang are bold and unscrupulous. Now, fortunately, heaven has taken their courage away, and You Tang discovered a major embezzlement in the funds of the parties involved, and also discovered concealment of evidence and embezzlement in their handover register. How can we tolerate this any longer? Moreover, Shanghai is a place where diplomatic eyes are gathered, and now that we are recovering jurisdiction, if we do not strictly investigate and impeach, then foreigners will definitely find an excuse, which will have a huge impact on the recovery of jurisdiction. In accordance with Article 2 of the Impeachment Law, I have compiled five volumes of the parties' deposit books and three volumes of the handover registers and submit the impeachment, requesting the government to break through the obstacles and promptly transfer the former President of the Shanghai Special District Court, Yang Zhaoyan, the former Chief of the Shanghai Local Court, Zheng Yuxiu, the Chief Clerk Niu Fuchun, and the Accounting Director Zheng Huichen to the Hangzhou Local Court for severe punishment, and recover all the embezzled funds to warn those who are treacherous and greedy and appease public resentment. It is all about restoring order for the country and restoring the reputation of the legal profession. In addition to Yang Zhaoyan being accused of various illegal acts in the Special Court, which will be handled separately, all the evidence of Zheng Yuxiu and Yang Zhaoyan's embezzlement and concealment of evidence should be submitted for verification and implementation.</p>
<h3>Suzhou Anhui Refugees Deported Back to Their Hometowns</h3>
<p>More than two hundred refugees from Anhui Province lingered in Mudu Town, Suzhou, intending to cause disturbances. The Silk Government dispatched a team of detectives and a water patrol squadron, dividing them among several boats on the morning of the 12th and escorting them towards Wujiang. From Wujiang, they will be transferred and escorted back to their hometowns.</p>
<h3>Wuxi Raises Funds to Dredge the Canal</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Stone Industry Trade Association previously received a letter from its members, including boat owners Ma Zhaozhen and others who transport and sell lime, stating that the canals at Jiting Bridge, Heqiao Yaodun, Wanmei Bridge, Daixi Bridge, Yuncun Town, and other locations in the Wuxi-Yixing Canal have become silted up in recent years. During winter, the water dries up, making navigation even more difficult. The lime industry relies on this canal as its only route, so they planned to jointly raise funds to dredge it. However, because all inland waterway steamships have a common interest in this matter, they specifically requested the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce to forward a letter to the Wuxi Inland Waterway Steamship Association, asking for subsidies. They also sent a letter to the Wuxi-Yixing-Changzhou Construction Bureau for record-keeping and to facilitate the project. The local Bureau Chief, upon receiving the letter, replied to the association, granting permission for them to proceed accordingly.</p>
<h3>Three Inches of Snow After Severe Drought</h3>
<p>Since the beginning of winter, the weather in the county has been inconsistently warm and cold. After the winter solstice, there were continuous cloudy and rainy days, and the weather turned warm, as if it were spring. If we are not careful, we easily suffer from sore throats, coughs, and other seasonal ailments. On the night before yesterday, it began to drizzle, which stopped yesterday morning. In the evening, a strong wind suddenly arose, followed by snow pellets. Heavy snow fell overnight and stopped at daybreak, accumulating about three inches.</p>
<p>The weather is also unusually cold, with dripping water freezing into ice, creating a silver world. Farmers are delighted to have this auspicious snow after a severe drought, and they all raise their heads in praise.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang Jiangnan Paper Mill Establishes Branch Factory in Zhenjiang</h3>
<p>The Jiangnan Paper Mill originally had a pulp-making branch factory in Gaozi, Zhenjiang, on the Shiyezhou Island across the river. It had previously suspended operations due to high costs. Last year, due to the national promotion of domestic goods, it resumed operations. The main raw material for paper pulp is reed stalks, mixed with wood, resulting in excellent quality, suitable for Lian Shi paper. Currently, the mill transports the pulp to Shanghai for papermaking, and the resulting paper still needs to be transported back into the Yangtze River.</p>
<p>Due to inconvenient logistics, it has been decided to use civilian land along the Zhenjiang side of Gaozi as the factory site. Yesterday, Zeng Shengwu, the manager of the factory, along with Xu Fudan, an engineering officer, made a special trip to Zhenjiang to visit County Magistrate Zhang, asking for his support. County Magistrate Zhang believes that promoting industry is welcomed by the locality and guaranteed his support as his duty.</p>
<p>They discussed all matters related to land purchase and factory establishment with Cao and Xu.</p>
<p>It is said that the purchased land is about three hundred mu, and the transaction can be completed within a month.</p>
<p>Construction can begin in March or April.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou Embezzlement of Opium Case Expanded</h3>
<p>The case of the Seventh District Public Security Bureau and the district office, along with various responsible personnel, jointly embezzling sixty-three boxes of intercepted private opium has attracted considerable attention from various sectors. Although the suspects were all released on bail by the Narcotics Investigation Office, the County Party Department's Supervisory Committee is paying close attention to this matter and is extremely concerned. Therefore, they filed a complaint, and it is said that Pan, the Chief Prosecutor of the County Court, also intervened, considering the case to be serious.</p>
<p>The Civil Affairs Department also sent personnel to investigate.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou Heavy Snow in Hangzhou City</h3>
<p>The weather in Hangzhou has been warm recently, no less than early spring. Since 7 PM on the 11th, a northerly wind suddenly arrived, and the weather turned sharply cold. Around 11 PM, snowflakes began to fall, continuously descending. By 4 PM today, the snow around West Lake was several inches thick, and the streets were also covered with a thick layer. This is the first snowfall in Hangzhou this year.</p>
<h3>East Street Fire Claims Two Lives</h3>
<p>The Taishanxiang Western Clothing Store at No. 113 East Street, Hangzhou, has been open for six years and has a good business. The owner, Wang Fengxiang, and his wife, Wang Fangshi, are diligent and frugal, and have a considerable surplus. Recently, as the end of the lunar year approached, Wang Fengxiang went to Liuxia the day before yesterday to collect disaster relief funds. Ms. Fang, being ill, hired a woman named Auntie Cha to help with cooking at home. On the evening of the 11th, a fire broke out due to unattended embers in the kitchen. The store employees Chen Yingzhang and Song Wanfu, as well as Fang Zhimou, the wife's younger brother who had just arrived in Hangzhou from Shanghai yesterday, were sleeping downstairs. Ms. Fang, her ten-year-old son, Peixin, and the hired woman were sleeping upstairs with Wang's seven-year-old daughter, Baolian. Upon hearing the alarm, the store employees and the hired woman all fled for their lives due to the intensity of the fire. Fang's younger brother rushed upstairs and carried Wang's ten-year-old son out. Ms. Fang, because her young daughter and savings had not been rescued, rushed back in to save people and retrieve items. Due to the intense fire and thick smoke, she and her young daughter, Baolian, tragically perished in the fire. In addition to the clothing store being burned down,</p>
<p>the fire spread to ten adjacent shops and residences, including Chen Xinggao's cooperage, Yihe Teashop, Jiang Yuxing's rag shop, Zhu Hengsheng's tavern, and residential houses,</p>
<p>affecting a total of twenty households, with losses estimated at thirty to forty thousand yuan.</p>
<h3>Shaoxing Money Shops Request Relief for Loan Extension</h3>
<p>Shaoxing money shops, due to Zhejiang's debt restructuring measures, which extended the repayment of provincial construction bonds to the 30th year of the Republic and the repayment of agricultural loans to the 25th year of the Republic (240,000 yuan in construction bonds and over 110,000 yuan in agricultural loans remaining after partial repayment), which is crucial to the lifeline of the money shops, yesterday specifically requested the County Chamber of Commerce to forward a request to the Provincial Government for relief measures to aid their turnover.</p>

<h3>Municipal Chamber of Commerce Reaffirms Call for Economic Severance with Japan</h3>
<p>Each Trade Association Has the Responsibility to Set an Example and Supervise</p>
<p>Must Faithfully Implement the Resolutions</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce yesterday issued a notice to all trade associations in the city, stating: "We are writing to you because on the 11th of this month, we received a letter from the Hunan People's Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association, which stated that since the fall of the Northeast, more than a year has passed, and the country's situation is precarious, like a pile of eggs. Looking back, our lost territory has not been recovered, internal conflicts are rampant, and bandit disasters are frequent, posing hidden dangers. The only thing that has allowed us to maintain a precarious and prolonged situation is the sincere resistance and repeated thwarting of the enemy's attacks, thanks to the Northeast Volunteer Army, who are not afraid of hardship and are determined to save the country, and to the people in the rear who have adopted the method of permanent economic severance with Japan. However, since its implementation, enemy goods have not only not been cleared but have become increasingly prevalent. Unscrupulous merchants, driven by greed, smuggle and trade them, resulting in effective means of importing goods but a lack of methods to prevent treacherous activities. According to recent reports, the import of Japanese goods has increased dramatically, being unloaded as soon as they arrive, and dumped in large quantities throughout the Yangtze River region, averaging over 50,000 pieces per week. The extent of the leakage is unimaginable. We believe that Shanghai, being the commercial center of the country and the source of enemy goods, can unite the people, close its borders, and strictly investigate,</p>
<p>recognizing the Japanese as enemies and treating Japanese goods as vipers and scorpions, eradicating evil completely, and uniting against the common enemy. Then, no matter how many enemy goods there are, they will inevitably be cut off, and no matter how cunning the merchants are, they will have no means to operate. We hope that everyone will advocate together, work together, and those who have anti-Japanese organizations should organize them tightly, and those who do not have them should proceed to organize them, gathering the patriotic enthusiasm of the people across the country for the final resistance. Then, the nation that is about to perish may still be saved." Shanghai has always been in a leading position in the country and has personally suffered the tragedy of the Shanghai Battle. The sincerity of patriotism,</p>
<p>and the will to resist the enemy, should be even more profound than elsewhere. However, the border crisis is becoming increasingly urgent, while people's hearts are becoming increasingly lax. The enthusiasm for resisting enemy goods is far less persistent than in remote provinces, which is truly a shame to the people and the country. This Chamber of Commerce and all trade associations have the responsibility to set an example and supervise. Based on the information in the letter, we are writing to you again, urging you to strictly abide by the original plan for economic severance with Japan, as resolved by the general meeting in September of the 20th year of the Republic, strictly enforce it, and conduct inspections at any time, so that no greedy individuals can undermine it, prolonging the enemy's ambitions and plunging the country into a situation from which it can never recover. This is of utmost importance."</p>
<p>Various Circles Urge Zhang Xueliang</p>
<h3>Persevere and Fight to the Death</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Party Department yesterday telegraphed Zhang Xueliang, saying: "To Comrade Zhang Xueliang in Beiping and all the generals and soldiers at the front: The Japanese army's attack on Shanhaiguan is a premeditated plan by the Japanese government. Fortunately, the generals and soldiers at the front are loyal, brave, and dedicated, fulfilling their duty to defend the country, embracing the spirit of sacrifice and struggle, and resolutely resisting and bravely killing the enemy. The fierceness of the fighting and the number of martyrs are no less than those of the Shanghai Battle. Although it is for strategic reasons that we have temporarily retreated, the invading Japanese have not given up their ambitions. We hope that comrades will persevere in their determination to resist, supervise their subordinates, persevere, and fight to the death, embracing the determination to be shattered like jade rather than preserved as tile. Resist to the end with every piece of armor and every inch of blade, striving to recover the lost territory and redress the national humiliation, fulfilling the military's duty to defend the country. The safety of North China is crucial to the survival of our nation. We must burn our boats and make a decisive move here. We cannot express our expectations enough. Sincerely, the Executive Committee of the Shanghai Special Municipality."</p>
<h3>Words and Bullets Go Forth, Encourage Bravery and Advance</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Educational Association yesterday telegraphed Zhang Xueliang in Beiping, saying: (Titles omitted) "The loss of Shanhaiguan and the emergency in Rehe, the enemy's forces are surging, intent on swallowing the heartland. With tigers and wolves entering the house, whose fault is it? Apart from armed resistance, there is no other way to save ourselves. Having read your telegram yesterday, we have realized that forbearance is not a good plan and are determined to resist, which we deeply admire. Now that the fierce battle has broken out, North China is in imminent danger. The generals and soldiers at the front are mostly patriotic people. If the督策 is proper, they will surely sacrifice themselves to kill the enemy. We hope that you will speak and shoot, encourage bravery and advance, defeat the stubborn enemy, and recover our lost territory. Then the countrymen who could not understand you in the past will surely serve as your strong supporters. The clouds are clearing, and we await the good news. The telegram is urgent, and we hope you will understand. Sincerely, the Shanghai Educational Association."</p>
<h3>Wang Shuchang Telegraphed Shanghai, Ordering His Troops to Wait in Readiness</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Local Association received a telegram from Wang Shuchang, saying: (Opening remarks omitted) "Having read your telegram, I am filled with righteous indignation and loyal patriotism. Your three proposals are well-founded and your words are solemn, which I admire. I am willing to maintain a common goal and supervise my troops to wait in readiness. I hope you will observe. Sincerely, Wang Shuchang."</p>
<h3>Wu Tiecheng Discusses the Shanhaiguan Incident, Says There Are Measures to Deal With It</h3>
<p>Rumors of Personnel Changes in Various Ministries and Bureaus Are Inaccurate</p>
<p>Wang Jingwei Will Leave Germany and Go Elsewhere</p>
<p>Shanghai Mayor Wu Tiecheng went to Nanjing some time ago on official business and reported on the public security situation in Shanghai to the central government. He returned to Shanghai from Nanjing yesterday morning. Our reporter interviewed him at the Municipal Government yesterday and asked about the central government's policies for dealing with the Shanhaiguan Incident and other issues. According to Mr. Wu, the central government, after repeated and thorough discussions, has decided on a step-by-step approach involving military and diplomatic measures. The details cannot be announced, but in short, the Shanhaiguan Incident is part of the entire Sino-Japanese question and cannot be treated as a local incident to be resolved on the spot. If the Japanese army invades, we will definitely resist. As for the rumors of partial personnel changes in various ministries, I have not heard of them while in Nanjing. The rumor that Shao Yuancong will be transferred to the position of Minister of Education is even more speculation. Shao is currently resting in Shanghai and will continue to serve as the Vice President of the Legislative Yuan in the future. The central government still hopes that Mr. Wu Ti Yun will be the Minister of Judicial Administration. The rumors about so-and-so are all inaccurate. The reporter then asked whether Mr. Wang Jingwei had already left Germany and whether he would return to China directly or go elsewhere. Mr. Wu said that the central government has repeatedly urged Mr. Wang to return to China to preside over important political affairs. Mr. Wang replied in a telegram that he would be able to return to China in six weeks, so he is now afraid that he will go elsewhere and not return directly. Mayor Wu finally said that the public security in Shanghai can be absolutely guaranteed. The government has well-defined measures for external affairs, and the public should remain calm and assist in the process, so as not to allow the enemy to take advantage of the situation and affect the government's overall plan. Furthermore, when Mr. Wu met with the press corps yesterday morning, he stated that he went to Nanjing this time to attend the dedication ceremony of the former President's tomb memorial hall and to meet with Chairman Chiang of the Military Affairs Commission. Liu Chongjie went to Beiping to inspect the situation in North China and will return to Nanjing soon. He had not heard of the rumor that Japanese warships were blocking our Jiangyin Fortress from conducting artillery tests.</p>
<h3>Two Organizations Eagerly Await Weng Zhaoyuan</h3>
<p>Urgently Need Airplanes to Save the Country</p>
<p>Telegraph to the United States Urging Him to Go: The Shanghai Northeast Volunteer Army Support Association, due to the increasingly aggressive Japanese invasion behavior after the fall of Shanhaiguan, and the possibility of the war expanding and lasting, yesterday urgently telegraphed General Weng Zhaoyuan in the Philippines, urging him to go to the United States as soon as possible to complete the organization of Chinese aviation and to quickly purchase airplanes with the funds that have already been raised for application.</p>
<p>Telegraph Urging Him to Return to China: The Shanghai All-Circles National Salvation Federation held its eighth standing committee meeting at the China Society at 4 PM yesterday, and officially resolved to telegraph Weng Zhaoyuan to return to China. The telegram is as follows: To the Siamese Consul in Manila for General Weng. The loss of Shanhaiguan is imminent, and the national crisis is becoming increasingly urgent. Please quickly ship the airplanes that have been raised and purchased back to China, and please return to the country immediately to resist the enemy. Sincerely, the Shanghai All-Circles National Salvation Federation,</p>
<h3>Xue Dubi Resigns</h3>
<p>To Practice Law in Shanghai</p>
<p>Member of the National Government, Mr. Xue Dubi, believing that the situation is critical, and that as he holds an important position in the central government, he has been unable to inquire about national affairs. Feeling ashamed to the people of the country, he had long intended to resign. Recently, with the loss of Shanhaiguan and the perilous situation in North China, and the call to resist Japan still not put into practice, he felt deep sorrow and indignation. Yesterday, he specifically telegraphed the Central Executive Committee and Chairman Lin of the National Government, requesting to resign from his position as a member of the National Government and has decided to practice law in Shanghai. Since he is well-versed in law, having served as a judge, president of the local court, and even Minister of Justice, changing his profession to lawyer will both achieve his goal of protecting civil rights and provide for his livelihood. It is said that his law office has been selected to be located in the Times Building on Avenue Edward VII and is scheduled to open on the 15th of this month. The telegrams of resignation from Mr. Xue to the central government and Chairman Lin have already been sent out, with similar wording. The following is the telegram to the central government: "To the Central Executive Committee in Nanjing, I, Xue Dubi, was elected as a member of the National Government by the First Plenary Session, but I have been unable to contribute to the current difficulties. After reflecting on myself, I feel deeply guilty. I now intend to practice law in Shanghai and request to resign from my position as a member of the National Government. I respectfully request your approval, as this is in the public interest. Xue Dubi."</p>
<h3>Beijing Telegram Corrects Rumors</h3>
<p>National News Agency: Our agency, because there were rumors that the Ministry of Finance had stopped issuing funds to various agencies and that the Central Bank had stopped payments, specifically telegraphed Beijing to inquire about the truth. The following is the telegram received: "To National News, Nanjing. Regarding the rumors circulating recently that the Ministry of Finance has stopped issuing payment orders and that the Central Bank has stopped payment orders to various agencies in Nanjing, we have learned from the responsible parties of the Ministry of Finance that there are no such orders. The funds for various agencies are still being issued as usual, and the Central Bank is also making payments as usual. The rumors are clearly fabricated by troublemakers."</p>
<p>Yesterday, Snowflakes Flew</p>
<h3>Shanghai-Beiping Air Service Opens</h3>
<p>Arrived Safely in Haizhou in the Afternoon</p>
<p>Shanghai-Chongqing Line Suspended Due to Snow</p>
<p>The China National Aviation Corporation's Shanghai-Beiping line has been delayed due to heavy fog in the past few days. Yesterday was Thursday, another regular flight day. The company still sent Nie Kaiyi, the head of the aircraft maintenance team, and An Lissen, the chief pilot, on the Bengbu aircraft at 9:05 AM, carrying 783 kilograms of mail, flying from Longhua along the Yangtze River to Nanjing first. At 11:11 AM, they took off from Nanjing again, flying around to Haizhou. The company received a telegram from Nie and others from Haizhou, stating that they had safely arrived in Haizhou at 11:29 AM in the afternoon. Whether they will fly again depends on the weather. According to Secretary Li Diezhuang, the Bengbu aircraft is scheduled to arrive in Tianjin around 5 PM, but it will definitely not fly to Beiping. Furthermore, according to news from the Shanghai Post Office, the air mail service from Shanghai to Beiping via Shanghai, Shangqiu, Nanjing, Haizhou, Qingdao, and Tianjin began flying on January 10 of this year. The northbound flight is scheduled to take off from Shanghai every Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday at 7:30 AM, and the southbound flight is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai every Wednesday, Friday, and Sunday at 5 PM. For other details, please inquire at the local post offices.</p>
<h3>Three Friends Factory Bribery Case Pronounced Yesterday</h3>
<p>Both Plaintiffs and Defendants Found Not Guilty</p>
<p>The Cotton Textile Industry Trade Association of the Seventh District recently accused Shen Jiucheng, Wang Xianhua, and Zhu Xing of the Three Friends Industrial Society of bribery to the First Special District Court. The trial concluded the day before yesterday, and the verdict was announced yesterday. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Pronounced Not Guilty: Yesterday afternoon was the scheduled date for the verdict of the case. In addition to the plaintiffs' agents, Zhang Yihai and Gong Zishen, who arrived on time to hear the verdict, none of the defendants were present in court. Only their defense lawyers were present to hear the verdict. After a while, Judge Liu Yugui, accompanied by clerk Huang Haiyun, pronounced the verdict in the Ninth Criminal Court, stating: "Shen Jiucheng, Wang Xianhua, Cen Zihou, Chen Wanyun, Lao Huimin, and Li Daofa are not guilty. Zhang Yihai and Gong Zishen are also not guilty."</p>
<p>Reasons for the Verdict: After Judge Liu finished the verdict, he immediately announced the reasons for the verdict in court, stating that according to the interpretation of the Criminal Law, union directors cannot be considered public officials.

<p>94-Year-Old Man</p>
<h3>Ma Xiangbo Advocates Borrowing to Resist the Enemy</h3>
<p>New Voice Society: Yesterday morning (the 11th), Mu Jun visited 94-year-old Mr. Ma Xiangbo and asked him what suggestions he had for dealing with the recent national crisis. Ma first replied with the method of "borrowing to resist the enemy." The following are his views as learned by the New Voice Society: "Currently, resisting Japan, as in the Shanghai Battle, our troops are only fighting with blood and lives. What we lack is military firepower, which is why we are losing everywhere. Japanese weapons are better than ours. Recently, Britain and France have transported huge amounts of military firepower to Japan, even selling postal ships to Britain and converting them into troop transport ships for use in the Northeast, with the intention of launching a major invasion. We have already borrowed wheat from the United States this year, why not proceed with large loans, asking the United States to lend us military firepower and various military supplies in exchange for silver, and we can promise the privilege of joint Sino-American investment in developing various industrial minerals and other projects. This would also greatly contribute to solving the domestic unemployment and veteran problems in the United States. Japan expects that the people of Europe and the United States will not waste their heads and sacrifice their lives to maintain international justice, so they are becoming more and more fierce, leading to the current situation. In our country, we have hundreds of thousands of soldiers, who are capable of enduring hardships, but we lack military firepower. If the US government implements and upholds its public declaration to the world of the so-called 'non-recognition of the fruits of aggression policy,' we can borrow a large amount of military firepower and enjoy the special benefits we grant them. Otherwise, if Japan's continental invasion policy is completed, the future clouds over the Pacific Ocean will be feared by all knowledgeable people in the world. The ancients had a teaching, 'Sufficient food, sufficient troops, and the people will trust it.' My advocacy is truly a way to save the situation."</p>
<p>Song Ziwen Proposes to Issue</p>
<h3>Aviation Highway Construction Lottery</h3>
<p>The National News Agency reports that Song Ziwen proposed to the Central Government, stating that the proposal concerns national lottery issuance, originating from foreign countries. It was originally a measure of last resort to raise funds for undertakings. During the late Qing Dynasty and early Republic of China, various provincial governments and public-private organizations successively imitated it for disaster relief, but due to poor management and lack of supervision, most of the funds were lost. In modern European and American countries, such as Germany, France, Austria, Russia, Italy, Ireland, Norway, Denmark, Spain, Romania, Turkey, Poland, New South Wales in Australia, and various South American countries, lotteries are issued to subsidize the national treasury. Not only does the national annual expenditure rely on them for supply, but also national libraries, museums, hospitals, schools, railways, and all construction projects are completed with the help of lotteries. The number is countless. Among them, Germany is the best in management and has the most outstanding achievements. Germany initiated this national lottery as early as 200 years ago. The number of issues reached a huge 320 million marks, and the national treasury's income accounted for about one-quarter (i.e., 80 million marks). In other countries, the surplus from lotteries also accounts for about 25% to 30% of the lottery amount. Our country has a vast territory, but transportation has always been inconvenient, resulting in slow economic development. As the world advances into the scientific era, our country's aviation industry is still in its infancy, and there are not many completed highways. According to the needs of industry, it is extremely insufficient. If we do not make thorough preparations for these two important policies to promote the development of inland industry, the decline will be unimaginable in the long run. Therefore, it is necessary to select key areas across the country, determine air routes, build airport facilities, aviation schools, aircraft repair factories, purchase aircraft, and build roads. All matters that need to be expanded should be expanded to establish a foundation for aviation and road policies. Aviation schools should be added to cultivate aviation administrative talents, otherwise we will lag far behind. Aviation and highway projects are important and urgently need to be implemented without delay. However, to undertake major projects, a large source of funds is required.</p>
<p>Considering the empty national treasury and the concern that military and political expenses may not be met, there is no extra capacity to raise such a large amount of money at the moment. However, the needs of the projects cannot be delayed any longer. Raising domestic debt is not feasible, and borrowing foreign debt is not an option. After repeated consideration, I believe that the current way to raise funds is to learn from Europe and the United States and issue lotteries by the central government, which is relatively easy. It is tentatively decided to issue lotteries four times a year, with each issue amounting to 9 million yuan. 90% will be used as prize money, 30% will be used for agency sales and underwriting, 5% will be used for issuance and office expenses, and the remaining 35% will be used for aviation and highway construction projects. Furthermore, previous lottery failures were mostly not due to improper ticket sales or fundraising systems, but rather to their flawed legislation, all due to the lack of a responsible supervisory body. This time, the central government will carefully formulate rules for the lottery and establish a special responsible body to strictly supervise the management. All measures will be taken with utmost care to eliminate past malpractices, and there will be considerable success. As for the public purchasing lottery tickets, it is a matter of personal freedom, usually based on</p>
<p>assessing their economic capacity, which is different from other speculative ventures where they risk their entire fortune on a single throw. Moreover, the handling of this lottery will be completely open, striving for</p>
<p>credibility. On the one hand, it will arouse the public's interest in investment, which will not harm people's livelihood, and on the other hand, it will promote the construction urgently needed by the country, which will greatly benefit the industry of the entire country. Therefore, the outline of the plan is drafted as follows: 1. This lottery is named the National Government Aviation Highway Construction Lottery and will be issued four times a year, with a total issue amount of 5 million yuan each time. 50% will be allocated for prize money, and the remaining 50%, after deducting handling fees for issuance and office expenses, will be fully allocated to aviation highway construction projects, such as purchasing aircraft, constructing airports, aviation schools, aircraft repair factories, carrying out all aviation</p>
<p>undertakings, and building highways. 2. A National Government Aviation Highway Construction Lottery Committee will be organized. The Minister of Finance will invite prominent figures from Chinese and foreign finance, commerce, and industry, as well as senior officials of the National Government, to serve as committee members. Each committee member will be a nominal</p>
<p>position, and the Minister of Finance will concurrently serve as the ex officio chairman, responsible for supervision and execution. 2. A National Government Aviation Highway Construction Lottery Office will be established. The director and other office personnel will be appointed by the Minister of Finance to handle all issuance matters. 4. The lottery tickets will be promoted by the committee's agency sales and underwriting groups in various regions. The drawing location will be in Shanghai. Each time the lottery is drawn, the Lottery Committee will send supervisory committee members to the site, together with representatives from the local court, the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, and the Banking Association, to supervise. 5. The lottery proceeds will be the responsibility of the Lottery Committee for safekeeping and will be deposited into various</p>
<p>credible banks at any time. All the above-mentioned plans for using lottery proceeds to develop the aviation industry and build highways should be properly drafted and proposed.</p>
<p>together with a draft of the Construction Lottery Regulations, for public decision. If approved, I hope it will be sent to the Ministry of Finance for thorough preparation and implementation, which would be fortunate for the national economy. Respectfully submitted by Song Ziwen, Acting President of the Executive Yuan and Minister of Finance. Attached is a draft of the National Government Aviation Highway Construction Lottery Regulations. National Government Aviation Highway Construction Lottery Regulations: Article 1: The National Government, in order to raise funds for the development of the aviation industry and the construction of highways, issues 500,000 registered lottery tickets, each priced at 10 national currency. This lottery is named the National Government Aviation Highway Construction Lottery. Article 2: To organize</p>
<p>a National Government Aviation Highway Construction Lottery Committee, with the Minister of Finance as the ex officio chairman, responsible for supervising the lottery, issuing all matters, and safeguarding the income from lottery proceeds. Article 3: To organize a National Government Aviation Highway Construction Lottery Office to handle all matters related to lottery issuance and sales. Article 4: For each issuance, the National Government will</p>
<p>allocate 50% of the proceeds. After deducting issuance and office expenses, such as ticket printing, advertising, staff salaries, and agency fees, the remaining funds will be used for construction project expenses. The remaining 50% will be used as prize money, and the grade distribution is as follows: First prize: 1 ticket, exclusively winning 500,000 yuan, totaling 500,000 yuan. Second prize: 2 tickets, each winning 200,000 yuan, totaling 400,000 yuan. Third prize: 4 tickets, each winning 50,000 yuan, totaling 200,000 yuan.

Eighth prize: 500 tickets, each winning 200 yuan, totaling 100,000 yuan. Ninth prize: 5,000 tickets, each winning 60 yuan, totaling 300,000 yuan. The total amount is 2.5 million yuan. Article 5: The prize money for this lottery will be paid in full without any discounts.

<p>Qu Yingguang Cables for Relief</p>
<p>The Shanghai Famous Charitable Organizations Relief Federation for Northeastern Refugees received a cable from Qu Yingguang, executive director stationed in Peiping, stating that there were many refugees in Qinhuangdao without anyone to care for them, and requested immediate dispatch of personnel for relief. The original cable from Qu is recorded as follows: "Gentlemen,</p>
<p>The gray telegram was received. Recently, I received a telegram from Lou Xiangyue and others in Tianjin, saying that in the recent Yuguan Incident, residents of the war zone fled alone at night, and many gathered in Qinhuangdao without anyone to care for them. They are suffering from hunger and cold and are dying everywhere, which is extremely pitiful. Please forward this to the association and request immediate dispatch of personnel for relief. How should it be handled? Please reply with instructions." It is heard that the chairman of the association, Xu Shiying, intends to convene an emergency meeting to discuss relief measures and then send a cable reply.</p>
<p>Representatives of the Overseas Chinese Thrift Association</p>
<h3>Zhang Xun et al. Issue Statements</h3>
<p>Since the September 18th Incident, the Overseas Chinese in Vietnam have been extremely indignant and have shown special concern for the Northeastern Volunteer Army, which is fighting in the icy and snowy fields to defend the nation. Recently, in view of the Japanese army's provocation in Rehe and Yuguan, the situation is critical. The Vietnam Overseas Chinese Economic Association sent Zhang Xun, He Shangping, Hu Zhigang, Wang Zhenqi, Liang Zhuomin, etc. back to the motherland to engage in various aspects of the national salvation movement. The delegation arrived in Shanghai on the same day. It is heard that after contacting various matters in the Beijing and Shanghai area, they intended to go north to Peiping and Tianjin, and then transfer to Rehe and the front to investigate the actual situation of the anti-Japanese war. The reporter of the China United News Agency specially visited the representative, Mr. Zhang Xun, this morning and issued the following statement:</p>
<p>We have lived abroad for a long time. Once we return to the motherland, our hearts are filled with joy, as happy as a child who has left home and sees their parents again. However, seeing this broken land, we cannot help but feel a layer of sorrow. This time, my brothers returned, driven by the sentiment of longing for the motherland, but also for the Overseas Chinese in Vietnam to understand the situation in the country, so we created this opportunity to meet with the motherland. Furthermore, the Vietnam Overseas Chinese Economic Federation has also remitted more than ten thousand yuan in the past year to the motherland for disaster relief and anti-Japanese funds, and several thousand bags of relief rice. All of us brothers were specially sent back to investigate the distribution of these silver rice, because the Overseas Chinese are eager to understand the situation in the country so that they can be more confident in raising donations and send them continuously. Now, we hope that the name community can give us appropriate guidance on the situation in the country, so that my brother can report to the Overseas Chinese in Vietnam according to the situation. This is a kind of wish of my brother. Overseas Chinese have always been rich in patriotism, and this may be generally recognized. However, the cultivation of this patriotic spirit is due to the fact that we live under others and are subjected to double oppression in everything. Secondly, seeing the tragic situation of national subjugation, we are extremely stimulated, so the patriotic spirit is relatively firm and strong. When the floods were disastrous the year before last, the Overseas Chinese in Vietnam felt very uneasy. We were busy all day with fundraising, opening up recreational performances, and busy with disaster relief work. One recreational performance had an income of 100,000 yuan, which can also show that the Overseas Chinese do not reduce their warm feelings for their compatriots in the country because they are far away from the motherland. But who would have thought that when thousands of miles of land were covered with water, the Shenyang incident occurred. At this time, the situation in the country was, of course, boiling, and the Overseas Chinese in Vietnam could be said to be crazy. I remember that when the fundraising recreational performance had not yet ended, we received the bad news of the Shen incident, which caused a commotion throughout the venue. The next night, the General Chamber of Commerce of China convened a conference of representatives from all walks of life, with thousands of participants. All the local police officers were dispatched, and the police chief personally responded to prevent riots, which also shows the surging situation of the overseas Chinese. Later, because the local situation</p>
<p>was related, it was impossible to establish a clearer banner of anti-Japanese imperialism. We had to organize a Chinese Economic Federation to carry out boycotts and fundraising work secretly. The association itself is organized by the alliance of business groups, so it is very powerful. In terms of fundraising, in addition to fundraising, most of the funds are drawn from the price increases for the entry and exit of goods by various businesses, so it can be sustained. The establishment of the Thrift Association is also based on this principle. The above is a general description of the situation of the Overseas Chinese in Vietnam in the country. As for the current situation of the Overseas Chinese in Vietnam, Vietnam is a rice-producing area, and rice is a major export commodity, which is the lifeline of the entire Vietnamese business. Recently, rice prices have been falling day by day, while gold prices have been rising (Vietnam's current currency system is still on the gold standard), so rice exports have been sharply reduced, and the entire Vietnamese business has been affected. Moreover, because the Sino-French Vietnamese Commercial Treaty cannot be fulfilled, the country is in a status without a treaty. The tax rate on Chinese goods entering Vietnam is particularly high, and the incoming Chinese goods have almost disappeared. Recently, the Japan-Vietnam Commercial Treaty has been implemented, and Japanese goods have the most favorable treatment, which is several times the tax payable on Chinese goods. For example, for tea, Chinese tea is taxed at 800 francs per hundred kilograms, while Japanese tea is only 400 francs. For Japanese silk, which is taxed at 1,000 francs, Chinese goods must pay more than 10,000 francs. Therefore, the current business situation is extremely tense. We hope that our compatriots in the country can understand these situations and give considerable help to promote the early implementation of the Sino-French Vietnamese Commercial Treaty, which is the most urgent hope of the Chinese businessmen in Vietnam. In short, we hope that our compatriots can deeply understand the place where the Overseas Chinese are located. As for the Overseas Chinese in Vietnam, they have only a simple wish for the national affairs, that is, all compatriots in the country should unite to resist violence, do not shout empty slogans, and work practically with conscience. We hope that the remittances can be properly distributed. Although the Overseas Chinese in Vietnam are currently in a difficult situation, they will also do their best to plan and provide continuous assistance. Recently, Yuguan has been occupied, and the situation in Rehe and North China is very tense. The Overseas Chinese in Vietnam must be very excited. In the current situation, all compatriots in the country should intensify their efforts in national salvation and resist to the end to fight for the final victory and preserve our nation. Otherwise, the ambitious enemies will be like a wild boar and a long snake, gaining an inch and wanting a mile, and the consequences will be unimaginable.</p>
<p>Women's Association for Relief in the Northeast</p>
<h3>Yesterday's Reception for the Press</h3>
<p>The Chinese Women's Association for Relief of Compatriots in the Northeast hosted the press at the World Society on Ferguson Road at 3:00 PM yesterday. Dozens of reporters from major newspapers attended. First, Ms. Wang Xiaoying, the chairman, reported on the association's recent situation, followed by speeches by Ms. Zhu Zhen and others. The speeches were omitted in length. The declaration is recorded as follows: Declaration of the Chinese Women's Association for Relief of Compatriots in the Northeast: The Northeast has been lost for more than a year, and the land between the white and black waters is full of blood and stench. It has suffered the ravages of enemy cavalry. All patriotic people share the same hatred for the enemy and vow to destroy this enemy. The Northeastern Volunteer Army's resistance and fighting has dyed a glorious page of history for our Chinese nation with fresh blood. Compatriots, sisters, the national crisis is serious, and foreign enemies are invading. Men are already doing their best to complete their national salvation responsibilities. We women, as citizens of China, should also rise up and bear this common national salvation responsibility. Let's think about it. Under the violent oppression and destruction of the Japanese pirates, the 30 million compatriots, the old, the weak, the young, the male, and the female, are unable to survive, crying for help, and fleeing, turning into corpses in the ditches. This is such a tragic and infuriating thing. Can we just enjoy ourselves and bear to sit idly by and watch the life and death of these 30 million compatriots? We have also seen the Northeastern Volunteer Army shedding blood and falling one after another. They are fighting and sacrificing for the country and the nation. Countries and nations in the world that know justice and righteousness will cheer and sympathize. All citizens of China should definitely rise up and think of ways to provide relief and assistance. Moreover, in this season of bitter cold winds and snow-covered roads, think of the people who are displaced and the Volunteer Army who are fighting in grass clothes. The situation is even more urgent and needs relief. Among the 200 million female compatriots in our country, there are many patriotic elements with knowledge and ability. In the face of this national crisis, how can we admit that we are useless, abandon our responsibilities, and be willing to be cold-blooded animals, and not hurry up to help relieve the Northeast, and not hurry up to help save the country? Female compatriots, hurry up and fight. Resisting Japan and saving the country is the way to maintain national survival. We must donate money and materials to fulfill our responsibility to relieve the compatriots in the Northeast. All of our 200 million female compatriots, let's unite and jointly shoulder the burden. Therefore, we initiated and organized this Chinese Women's Association for Relief of Compatriots in the Northeast, and hereby declare it. We hope that women from all over the country will rise up together to participate and strive to be the backing for the Northeastern compatriots in saving the country and resisting the enemy. The association's plea for the Northeastern compatriots who are starving and freezing and fighting in the icy and snowy fields states: The Northeast has been lost for more than a year. Although the compatriots in our three provinces are under the iron heel of the violent Japanese, they have continued to resist and fight at the expense of their lives, fighting for the dignity of the country and the freedom of the nation. Heads are being cut off, blood is flowing, and corpses are all over the field. Now it is midwinter, the north is bitterly cold, and the Japanese atmosphere is even more urgent. Our 30 million compatriots are enduring hunger and cold, and are running in the icy and snowy fields. Even if they do not die in the artillery fire, they will starve and freeze to death. The Japanese slaves, based on their consistent policy, after swallowing the Northeast, will inevitably plot against the Central Plains. If the Northeast is lost, how can Guan Nei survive alone? We and others are willing to use the purpose of saving people and saving ourselves to awaken the compatriots throughout the country. We hereby initiate this association and respectfully ask our female compatriots throughout the country to rise up resolutely, join this association, cooperate with one heart, fulfill the responsibility of a citizen, donate money and materials, relieve the Northeast, and jointly save the crisis. Female compatriots, why don't you come? The association's address is 393 Ferguson Road (north of Avenue Joffre), French Concession, World Society. Receiving money: Shanghai Women's Commercial Savings Bank (Nanjing Road), China Industrial and Commercial Bank (Henan Road), Bank of China, Jincheng Bank, Dalu Bank, Silk Industry Bank, Bank of Communications, Guohua Bank, Siming Bank, Shanghai Bank.</p>
<h3>Li Bangdong Discusses the Administration of the Qiongyai Special District</h3>
<p>Li Bangdong, Secretary of the Qiongyai Special District Chief Executive's Office, arrived in Shanghai from Guangdong last night (12th). According to his discussion on the administration of the Qiongyai Special District, although it is temporarily suspended at present, the system still exists. Once the bandit atmosphere in the area is slightly suppressed and the environmental resistance is reduced, the chief executive, Wu Chaochu, will continue to develop it to implement his original intention. Wu's development of the border areas, consolidation of national defense, promotion of production, and planning for the new development of the national economy were long admired and praised by President Sun Yat-sen. His work on Qiongyai did not start today, and he can be said to be earnestly implementing the Three Principles of the People, and he is indeed a builder who engages in grassroots work. The Chinese people may not fully know this point, which is actually covered by his reputation in diplomacy. I am rushing to Shanghai, and regarding the question of the special office in Guangzhou, I still need to pay a visit to the chief executive to report.</p>
<h3>Commander of the Righteous Army, Zhou Han, Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Reports on the Organization and Process of the Army</p>
<p>Zhou Han, commander of the Independent 7th Detachment of the 1st Army Group of the Northeastern Volunteer Army, arrived in Shanghai yesterday. He hosted the press at 6:00 PM to report on the organization and process of the army, and the recent combat situation in great detail.</p>
<p>The Board of Directors of China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Decided on Debt Repayment Standards Yesterday</p>
<p>Below 5,000 yuan········ 35%</p>
<p>Below 10,000 yuan········ 25%</p>
<p>Above 10,000 yuan········ 20%</p>
<p>Central News Agency reports that the Board of Directors of China Merchants Steam Navigation Company held its ninth meeting at 4:00 PM yesterday. Eight directors including Shi Liangcai, Du Jian, Hu Junzhuang, Zhang Shou, Sheng Pingchen, Yang Zhixiong, and Qian Yongming attended. Shi Liangcai chaired the meeting. The meeting adjourned at 6:00 PM. A preliminary standard for repaying a percentage of the debts was discussed, which will be implemented after the Ministry allocates funds. The standard is that those below 5,000 yuan will be repaid 30% first, those below 10,000 yuan will be repaid 25%, and those above 10,000 yuan will be repaid 20%. After the meeting, according to Shi Liangcai's statement to the Central News Agency reporter, the Board of Directors is now in the process of settling accounts with the business community, and various parties are demanding debts very urgently. Therefore, it was decided to petition the Ministry of Communications to raise funds to cope with the situation. In addition, more than 20 companies, including Shao Yuanji Construction Plant, Longchang Machinery Plant, and Senhua Coal Company, urgently need to settle their debts. They had previously sent letters requesting repayment. Yesterday, taking advantage of the Board of Directors' meeting, they sent representatives to demand compensation. According to the reporter's investigation, these more than 20 companies have a total debt of about 440,000 yuan, including about 200,000 yuan in coal debts, 100,000 yuan in hardware debts, and about 100,000 yuan in other items such as repairs. All the debts are old debts, some of which have been accumulated since the tenure of the former Director Zhao and have not been repaid to this day. After the Board of Directors adjourned the meeting, the representatives of the creditors urgently requested to see them. Shi Liangcai replied that the Board had discussed a solution to the various debts and asked them to come to the bureau tomorrow to hear the news. The representatives of the creditors left without getting what they wanted.</p>
<h3>The Extraterritorial Telephone Issue Will Be Resolved Soon</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the English version of the text was discussed</p>
<p>Central News Agency reports that the issue of extraterritorial road construction telephones in this city has been substantially resolved after repeated consultations between the Municipal Public Works Bureau and the Shanghai Telephone Bureau with the Shanghai Telephone Company. The Chinese version of the contract has been drafted long ago, and now it will be translated into English.

It is also learned that after the English version of the contract is translated, the contract can be signed in the shortest possible time.</p>
<h3>Huang Boqiao Dismisses a Large Number of Redundant Staff After Taking Office as the Director of the Railway Bureau</h3>
<p>Since Huang Boqiao took office as the Director of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Bureaus, he has been extremely strict in the use of personnel. In recent days, many of the old Railway Bureau staff have been dismissed. In addition to the dismissal of the Director and Deputy Director of the Materials Department, it is now heard that the Director of the Transportation Department, Zheng Baozhao, will also be changed.</p>
<h3>The Director of the Stamp Tobacco and Alcohol Bureau Prohibits Soliciting and Collecting Fees</h3>
<p>Since the Jiangsu Stamp Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Bureau's tobacco and alcohol tax fees were reorganized, there have been large amounts of arrears between the branch bureaus. We have to investigate the situation, replace</p>
<p>personnel separately, and handle the matter impartially according to the regulations. We will never add any preconceived notions. However, the two directors, Jiang and Luo, are afraid that the staff in the bureau may be soliciting or privately accepting fees outside, which is not only not tolerated by the law, but also greatly damages the reputation of the bureau. Therefore, they have specifically and earnestly warned each other, not saying that the staff is not virtuous, but</p>
<p>for mutual diligence. They also ordered the directors of each branch bureau to understand this meaning and not to take the exam lightly and take responsibility for themselves.</p>
<h3>Japanese Naval Ministry Sends Another Official to Shanghai　　Naval Attache Captain Kaizawa Arrives　　Shanghai Telegraph Agency Local News: Naval Ministry representative Kawashima recently returned to Japan, and the ministry has dispatched Naval Attache Captain Kaizawa to China.

<p>Resolution of Seamen to Form Support Association for the "Wusong" Incident　　The British-owned Taikoo Steamship Company, in violation of settlement record No. 235 of the Social Bureau, implemented new regulations, expelling workers from the "Wusong" ship, causing disturbances. Yesterday, seamen from various ships in the Jianghai area formed a support association for the tragedy and issued a declaration. The Changzheng authorities are conducting mediation. The business directors of various ships are scheduled to negotiate with the company today. The important points are recorded below:　　Seamen's Congress</p>
<p>Wusong: Gao Kunquan, a worker at the heart of the Wusong incident, is still missing as of yesterday, despite inquiries from union representatives. The four injured workers, including Zhang Yongfu, were sent to the hospital and are in serious condition, but their lives are not in danger. Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, the Seamen's Middle Cabin Union held a congress of representatives from various ships. Ninety-seven representatives from ships like Jianxin attended and resolved to establish a support association for the Wusong case. Tao Youxi, Zhao Quan, Lü Shuangfu, Wang Shenxiu, Xie Huimin, Song Tang, Zhou Xiaoting, Wang Min, and Wei Xie Sheng were elected as committee members. Tao Youxi, Lü Shuangfu, and Xie Yucheng were elected as standing committee members. Zhou Xiaoting also served as the director of the Propaganda Section, and Wei Xie Sheng as the director of the Organization Section. Gao Yongliu, Wang Yichuan, Qian Zhiyun, and others were appointed as members. The organizational rules were then passed.</p>
<p>New Company Regulations: Following the Wusong incident, Zhang Keying, the business director of the ship, rushed to Shanghai from Suzhou and received a letter from Taikoo Company dated December 28, stating: "Dear Sir, our company intends to take back the management of passenger affairs of the Wusong ship from January 1, 1933, and manage it directly. However, the storage and loading of goods on the ship will still be your responsibility as usual. The company will pay commissions for passenger tickets sold by you or your staff." The new business director replied to the company, saying: "Dear Sir, I went to Suzhou a few days ago on business. I suddenly received a telegram from Zhu Huanqing and learned that a large number of hooligans had used weapons to drive out the original workers of our ship. Because the company had stopped our ship for more than a day, I went to Suzhou a few days ago, so I had no prior knowledge of this unfortunate incident. However, the workers thought it was my conspiracy. I had absolutely no prior knowledge, and the original workers were all my colleagues for many years. I want to help them, but I cannot bear to drive them away. However, my strength is weak and my ability is limited, and I cannot save them. I am sending a special letter to ask your executive committee to handle the matter fairly and to explain it to the workers in detail to avoid misunderstandings. I will be very grateful."</p>
<p>Inquiry to the Company: After discussion at a meeting, the China Shipping Mutual Aid Association sent a letter to Taikoo Company yesterday, stating: "Regarding the sudden incident on the Wusong ship, we have read the telegram from the Shanghai Branch of the China Seamen's Union on the 11th and the letter from Lu Chazhi of the Jianghai Shipping Middle Cabin Union, both of which believe that Zhang Keying, the compradore of the Wusong ship, was the mastermind. According to the letter from our member Zhang Keying, he went to Suzhou on business and had no prior knowledge of the unfortunate incident. Therefore, this case is related to the interests of our members, so we should uphold fairness and express our true position. Although the investigation shows that the change of the Anqing schedule to Wusong is beyond the authority of the shipping business director, and the deployment of armed Chinese and Western detectives is beyond the ability of the business director, the two sides have different opinions and there is no way to deal with it. Therefore, we are sending a special letter to your company for proof to avoid injustice. We hope you will reply." At the same time, a letter was sent to the Middle Cabin Union.</p>
<p>Negotiation Method: Zhu Guilin, a mediator sent by the Social Bureau, Xu Shiqi, sent by the Seamen's Special Party Department, and Dai Youheng, sent by the Municipal Party Department, met with Zhou , Yu Rongzhi, representatives of the Seamen's Middle Cabin Union, and Zhu Huanqing and Zhang Keying, business directors of various ships, at the China Shipping Mutual Aid Association yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM to negotiate a solution. They believed that Taikoo Company's violation of the settlement record was inappropriate and decided to strictly prevent the recurrence of unfortunate incidents. They also ordered the business directors to contact the company to seek a solution. It is said that in addition to writing to the company, the China Shipping Mutual Aid Association will send representatives to contact the company's executives this morning.</p>

At around 11:00 PM, it began to snow, and by late at night, there was a heavy snowfall. By dawn, the snow was several inches thick. Looking out from a high place, it was like a world of silver.

<p>Business News and Finance Never Ceasing, Spot Gold Rebounds Well, at Six Liang Eight Qian</p>
<p>The whole city shows no special changes. Yesterday, the gold market slightly improved. Transactions were sparse. Although people's hearts continued to be uncertain, they were more stable than the previous day. Foreign telegrams from London showed that large bars rose by 125 points in both near and far terms. Although exchange rates continued to rise, the increase was minimal. Although the American Bank rose by 25 points, the forward silver prices saw mixed ups and downs. The degree of the American Bank's rise was not satisfactory. In addition, the bank's private telegrams only levied an additional 0.0625. Therefore, the opening gold price opened high, at 798 liang and 8 qian. The exchange market also tended to be tight. Banks opened recent British exchange rates at 1 shilling and 8 pence 0.0625, and U.S. dollars at 28 yuan 0.0625, which were both softer than the previous close and the same as the initial opening in the early morning. The gold market became more stable, hovering high after 98 liang and 7 qian. However, each firm had few transactions, hovering between the 800 liang mark. The Central Bank continued to open spot, so the price rose. In addition, the chips had long been exhausted, and it was not easy to seek bars, so it rose to 802 liang and 7 qian, and then showed a hovering trend. The after-market opened slightly, and then the price rose by 0.055 liang because the Central Bank came to open spot again, and the exchange market became tighter, with April U.S. dollars trading at 28 yuan and 0.0625. However, good times did not last long. Bombay suddenly telegraphed an increase of 2 annas, and the price returned to the original price. Before the close, because the exchange market's April U.S. dollar 125 was not asked for, it once fell to within 1 liang. However, the Central Bank continued to enter bars and closed at 801 liang and 3 qian. The process of the day was peaceful, with no unexpected changes. The situation of the whole city today is recorded below.</p>
<p>The Pre-Market Moved In and Out of the 800 Liang Mark</p>
<p>The opening immediately showed a good side, at 798 liang and 8 qian, jumping 4 liang and 3 qian higher than the previous close. Afterwards, it showed an upward trend. Yongfeng came to enter bars, and the price rose by 1 liang, to 9 liang and 7 qian. Dadecheng stopped at the 800 liang mark and sold, retreating to within 8 liang. At this time, there was a slight hover, and the amount of bars was relatively dry, so buyers were very laborious, hovering around 9 liang and a half. People's hearts were upward. Dadecheng saw that the situation was not good, and suddenly reversed and entered. Fuyu also came to enter at this time, and then crossed the 800 liang mark to 0.05 qian, 0.0625. The peers in the February U.S. dollar wanted to climb but could not, and the gold market was extremely stable. Unfortunately, Qianchangxiang dumped in the customs (800 liang), giving it a blow at one time. Hengyu also sold, and then it fell to 99 liang and 4 qian. After that, the April U.S. dollar in Shanghai ate in 1875, which was 0.0625 tighter than the initial time. Yifeng, Hengxing, Yongfeng, Yuanmao, and Yongjin reached outside 0.01 liang. Retail investors and Wanxing sold, falling by more than 2 liang. HSBC's listed British and American currencies did not move at all. In addition, the April U.S. dollar 1875 was difficult to connect. Qingfa, Yong and others came to enter, and then reached outside 0.01 liang. However, the situation hovered. HSBC sold the April shilling 125, and Dadecheng and Fuyu sold again, retreating into the 800 liang mark. Sassoon climbed the May shilling 125. Hengxing, Zhifeng, and Yong came to enter, while Hengyu and others exited. Therefore, the gold price hovered around 800 liang for a long time. When the news came that the Central Bank had opened more than 210 spot, and the price was calculated at 800 liang, Dadecheng and Qianchangxiang came to enter, rising to 0.017 qian. Hua Bi released this month's U.S. dollar at 28 yuan. Peers' psychology wavered and saw the price within 0.01 liang again. At this time, Qianchangxiang was the seller, and Hengxing was the buyer. Retail investors shifted according to the situation, and the price hovered again. After entering, Yingfeng, Heng, and Wupin advanced to 0.027 liang. Hengxing sold more than 100 bars on behalf of customers, and it was within 2 liang. Fuyu, Zhifeng, Yong, and others advanced to around 2 liang and 2 qian. Wanxing, Hengxing, and Wupin still exited, and reached 0.013 qian. After that, there were very few transactions, and the market was light. The bank exchange market was also flat, and there were many times when there were no waves. Approaching the close, Hengyu came to purchase, and Yuanxin and Yong then competed to advance bars, raising the price to 2 liang and 6 qian. Heng (without a license) sold at a limited price, and Hengyu also entered fully, and then retreated by a few qian, closing at 802 liang and 4 qian. Wupin patted 0.023 liang.</p>
<p>The Post-Market's Highest Peak Was 0.055 Liang</p>
<p>The afternoon opening was slightly lower by 3 qian, at 0.02 liang, and then 1 liang and 9 qian. Yifeng and Yong came to purchase. The market was very short of normal trading. Retail investors picked up the price, at around 3 liang. HSBC ate the January U.S. dollar at 9375. Hengyu took the opportunity to enter, at around 4 liang. Zhongfu entered the April U.S. dollar at 0.0625. Dadecheng continued to enter, and even reached 0.046 liang. Retail investors sold, and reached 0.037 liang. Zhengjin ate the March U.S. dollar at 28 yuan. The Central Bank rose again to open spot. Yuanmao, Fuxing, and Yongjin reached 4 liang and 7 qian. Qingfa, Yong, and Fuyu sold slightly, at 4 liang and 3 qian. Hengxing immediately entered the market to advance bars. The market all knew the news that the Central Bank was opening spot, and then rose sharply to make up for it, leaping to 0.055 liang. However, good times did not last long. Bombay suddenly reported a rise of 2 annas. Retail investors were caught off guard. Wupin and Hengyu then competed to sell, and in a blink of an eye, it was cut by 2 liang and 3 qian, to 0.032 liang. The market situation turned tired and showed a boring color again. There was a rise and fall of 1 or 2 qian for a long time. Bombay telegraphed that after the movement stopped, it went down by a small anna, to 0.04 liang. Anda released the January U.S. dollar at 9375, which was 0.0625 looser than when it was tight. Yuanmao and Yong sold, to 3 liang. Yongfeng released, and then broke 3 liang. Yuanchun also sold, and saw 0.02 liang. Yuanmao and Yong continued to sell, to 1 liang and 3 qian. Dakang also sold more than 100 bars after this, but the price rose instead, because the bank's April U.S. dollar 125 still had an intention to accept, and it returned to outside 0.02 liang and hovered. Approaching the close, the exchange note suddenly loosened, and gold traders wanted to sell the April 125, but there were no buyers. In the market, Yongfeng sold hundreds of bars sharply, and the price could not support it, falling to 0.007 qian. Tongfeng, Heng, and other spot firms again opened 210 bars on behalf of the Central Bank, and the price was 0.01 liang, so it closed at 0.013 liang. After the close, Hengxing and Fuyu sought bars very eagerly, doing up to outside 2 liang, so Wupin patted and closed at 0.018 liang. Checking the highest price of the day, 805 liang and 5 qian, and the lowest price, 798 liang and 7 qian, there was a review of 6 liang and 8 qian. As a result, it rose 6 liang and 8 qian compared to the previous close.</p>
<p>The Published Price Was Slightly Suppressed by 6 Liang and 8 Qian</p>
<p>The published price was that the U.S. exchange rate HSBC's listed price did not move, and it was still 27 yuan and 75 fen. Calculated at 24,000, the calculated gold price was 864 liang, 8 qian, and 6 fen. According to the closing price, it was about 63 liang more, 6 liang and 8 qian less than the previous close. The January and February ledger entries were both 802 liang. The make-up water was 800 liang in the morning and 799 liang in the afternoon.</p>
<p>The Central Bank Opened More Than 1,000 Spot</p>
<p>The Central Bank opened no less than 1,000 spot today, which were done by Dadecheng, Tongfengheng, Hengyu, Qianchangxiang, etc. The minimum opening price was about 800 liang, and the maximum opening price was about 0.05 liang.</p>
<p>Rare Transactions on the Table</p>

<p>Yutianfengyong advanced first and exited later. The Dalian gang Shunli exited a small number. The Guang gang Yifeng slightly advanced. Hengyu City exited more and advanced less. Roughly, there were not many net advances. The amount of bars in February, up to the 11th, totaled more than 18,500 bars.</p>
<p>Sycee Transactions Were 300 to 400 Liang</p>
<p>The sycee market situation was still stable and Confucian. Yesterday's market still calculated according to the addition of 9 liang. Transactions slightly improved. Qianchangxiang and others slightly sold in the market. Buyers still had vitality. Tongfeng and others entered, which were sold by silver shops. Transactions were approximately 300 to 400 liang.</p>
<p>Swaps Have Disappeared</p>
<p>There were no formal transactions throughout the day. The amount of bars in January decreased even more. Up to the 11th, there were 350 bars. The exchange market was nominally flat but secretly tight.</p>
<p>Since the exchange market tended to be hard with the gold price the day before yesterday, yesterday was a good sign. Overseas telegrams from London showed that large bars rose by 125 points in both near terms. Although the American Bank rose by 25 points, it was not much. In addition, the forward silver prices had both ups and downs. The bank's private telegrams only added 0.0625, which was less than the drop made the day before yesterday. The bank's appetite was thus healthier. The opening was immediate. Afterwards, HSBC's listed prices did not move, and it became more tense. The after-market was still the same, and the afternoon opening was even better. Finally, it turned around, because Bombay reported a large increase, and the gold price also fell. By the time of the close, it was extremely flat. The ups and downs throughout the day were extremely flat. The gold industry first climbed and then stuffed. Oriental brokers and Huabi all climbed. Anda, Citibank, and Meifeng stuffed more and climbed less. There was an up and down of 125 (shilling) and 1875 (U.S. dollar) in the whole city. The result of the day was 125 (shilling) and 1875 (U.S. dollar) tighter than the previous close. The British and American exchange rates traded at 3 yuan, 3 jie, and 7 fen in May. Anda sold shillings and purchased U.S. dollars, which was done in the morning.</p>
<p>(British Exchange) The morning opening was immediately tight, with the January asking price calculated at 1 shilling, 8 pence, and 0.0625. Heyi first sold February at 0.0625. Sassoon suddenly climbed May 125, which Mitsui heard and released. HSBC released April 0.0625. Sassoon entered May 125 and sold February 0.0625, which was a deal made with Huabi. The afternoon close asking price ranged from 9375 to 1 shilling, 8 pence, and 125. The bid price ranged from 1 shilling, 8 pence to 1875. In the afternoon, Mitsui first ate March 8 pence. Shanghai sold April at the same price. Huabi ate Anda and sold February for only 8 pence. Transactions were extremely rare. Extending to the close, the asking price for January and February was the same, 1 shilling and 8 pence. The March and April asking prices were the same, 0.0625. The bid prices were 0.0625 and 125. (U.S. Exchange) The morning opening was as tight as the shilling. The asking price for January was calculated at 28 yuan and 0.0625. In the middle, Citibank first entered April, also at 25.

Citibank Yun stuffed January 9375, which Huabi and Zhengjin ate. Up to the close, the asking price was the same as in the morning, with January calculated at 27 yuan 9375, February at 28 yuan, March at 0.0625, April at 125. The bid price ranged from 28 yuan to 1875. One U.S. dollar was still equal to 3 liang, 6 qian, and 0.036 li. Large bars are quoted at 17 pence for the forward term.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 12th, reported that large bars continued to rise. The closing price was 16 pence 9375 for the near term and 17 pence for the forward term, an increase of 0.0625 each compared to the previous day. In addition, the British and American exchange rate opened at 3 yuan, 3 jiao, and 5 fen 62.</p>
<p>Turkey Will Mint Silver Coins</p>
<p>Reuters, Aston Burr, January 11th, reported that the Turkish government plans to issue silver coins worth 3.4 million pounds to replace paper money, commonly known as 1 silver dollar as 1 Turkish pound, and 3 types of 50 piastres and 25 piastres. Their prices are equal to 3 shillings, 1 shilling and 6 pence, and 9 pence, while 1 piastre will be made of copper. This case will be submitted to the parliament first, and its passage time must be in the spring. Near the End of the Lunar Year, There Is an Occasional Change in Subsidiary Coins</p>
<p>Yesterday's premium market situation was mostly the same as the previous few days, and even if there were any, they were minor, because the source of customers will soon be endless, but the elimination due to the end of the relationship feels less. Therefore, the current bottom in this street does not worry about exhaustion, and the situation is still abundant, and the price is ultimately difficult to rise. The silver root situation is particularly loose. However, there are occasional changes in subsidiary coins at the end of the year. Yesterday's rise in Guangjiao and the shrinkage of copper coins are probably due to this.</p>
<p>The Premium's Rise and Fall Are Not Strong [Foreign Premium] The early market was 7 qian, 1 fen, 3 li, 6 hao, and 2 huiban. The afternoon market was 7 qian, 1 fen, 3 li, 7 hao, and 5 huiban. As a result, the early market was slightly better by 3 hao and 7 huiban than the previous day. [Silver Premium] The early and afternoon markets were both 2 fen, which was the same as the previous day. The drawing head did not add water and was still a white drawing. The silver root was very abundant.</p>
<p>Guangjiao Rose and Steel Coins Shrunk</p>
<p>The early and afternoon markets for Jiangnan small silver were both 6 qian, 3 fen, and 3 li, which was slightly higher by 1 li than the previous day. Transactions were 5,500 jiao in the early market and 4,500 jiao in the early market. The early market for Guangdong small silver was 6 qian, 2 fen, and 2 li, and the afternoon market was 6 qian, 2 fen, 2 li, 3 hao, and 7 huiban. As a result, it was a total of 1 li and a half better than the early market the previous day. Transactions were 85,000 jiao in the early market and 45,000 jiao in the afternoon market. Copper coins continued to shrink by 2,500 wen, to 384,000 wen. Transactions were more than 33,000 strings of wen.</p>
<p>The Inflow and Outflow of Silver Dollars Are Moderate</p>
<p>[Silver Funds] Yesterday, the bank's receipt and delivery were not very trivial, and they were not weak. Chinese merchants received and delivered more than 2.9 million in ticket funds, foreign merchants received and delivered 2.3 million in ticket funds, pledged 1.7 to 1.8 million, telegraphed more than 500,000, pawned transactions 8 to 900,000, settled 1.8 to 1.9 million, various goods, exchange taxes, miscellaneous funds received and delivered more than 8.1 million, special funds received and delivered 3.8 to 900,000, 1.2 million were taken out of the warehouse, Qian Jianzhuang Silver Public Sheet received and delivered more than 33 million, the drawing head funds received and delivered more than 4.3 million, various exchange funds received and delivered more than 800,000, cash received more than 100,000, and settled 5 to 600,000.

<p>At this time of the national calendar's new year, foreign affairs and commerce have not yet developed, and most of the abolition side is engaged in closure. Outstanding debts are all being settled on a large scale. Therefore, the atmosphere outside is showing two states: (1) In terms of debt, regardless of the amount, it must be arranged as much as possible to make up for the funds. (2) In terms of creditor's rights, because there are nearly 70 to 80% of outstanding accounts, if strict demands are not made, the mistakes of the previous year will inevitably be repeated. Therefore, recently, all outstanding debts handled by various doctors, regardless of whether they are solid or not, are being urged. As a result, up to yesterday, banks have collected more than 800,000 in total, and money houses have collected more than 2 million in total (including long-term), accounting for 30 to 40% of the total amount. According to people in the industry, outstanding debts in this port can still be demanded every day, but few have come from other ports so far, and it is feared that closure within the year will be particularly difficult. Securities Debt Prices Fell Slightly by 3 to 4 Jiao</p>
<p>Yesterday (12th), among the spot goods of various debts in the Chinese merchant securities transaction, only the whole 6, demobilization, and unified tax were released. Only 9,500 yuan was traded. The futures market was as flat as before. Large households were watching. Most of the market transactions were for settlement and swaps. There were no large inflows and outflows. It is estimated that more than 4.6 million was released in the morning market and 4.3 million yuan in the after-market, totaling 8.975 million yuan. Among them, the salt tax was more than 2 million, the unified tax was about 1.5 million, and the demobilization 20 opening also had more than 1 million. However, the customs tax 96 whole 6 was very clear. As for the changes in various debts, they were generally peaceful. There was a hover of about 1 yuan between the pre- and post-markets. In the two markets in the morning, there were more slight increases. In the afternoon, the demand was cold and the side tended to be tired. At first, there was a drop of about 6 or 7 jiao. However, in the closing market, the price saw a slight increase again. Especially, the rise and fall were always very small. As a result, compared to the previous day, only the compilation and legacy, 19, rose slightly, and the rest fell by about 2 or 3 jiao. The 20 Guan and the 20 Rolling, the next month's term, fell by about 7 jiao. Observing the current market situation, it is more dull than before, and the price is even more difficult to predict. The New York Stock Market Is Calm Again</p>
<p>Xinfeng Foreign Firm reported that on Wednesday (11th), the New York stock market continued the momentum of the previous day. The initial opening continued to rise, and the transactions were quite active. However, the market was full of reports that the Sino-Japanese situation in the Far East had a tendency to expand. People's hearts turned tired. Wheat fell first, and stocks also fell in succession. As a result, it was in a mixed state compared to the previous day. The total number of shares traded throughout the day was 1.61 million shares. In addition, according to the Iron and Steel Century Report, the workload of steel this week is 15%, mostly for the automobile, canned food, machinery, and air conditioning industries. It is expected that the railway industry will also have a large need to maintain various roads. The Dow Jones Index is listed on the left.</p>

<p>Yarn and Cotton Idle Speculative Yarn and Cotton Market</p>
<p>The yarn market situation is extremely scattered. Most people's psychology is that as the end of the lunar year approaches, they are handling closing procedures. The scope of business is shrinking, and business is particularly light. In addition, foreign insults are urgent, and financial constraints are tightening. The future situation is inevitably bleak.</p>
<p>Quiet and Tired Human Standard</p>
<p>The human standard market opened in the morning. As American cotton turned down, people's energy was scattered. Each month fell by 1, 2, and 3 qian. In the afternoon, it was heard that the bean demand was dim, and the market situation was still tired. However, some people were doing more because the bottom disk was small. The far month rose by 2 qian. The total transaction statistics for the whole day were 13,500 packages. It was found that Gengfeng sold 550 packages, Renfeng 500 packages, Changfeng 350 packages, Yuantai 400 packages, and Xincheng 400 packages. Bought nearly Xincheng 750 packages, Changfeng 1,300 packages, Dachang 650 packages, and Yuande 350 packages. The closing price is listed below.

<p>Sparse Real Demand</p>
<p>The current yarn's path is quite full and stagnant. It was found that the total number of packages bought by various gangs throughout the day was 238 packages. The market was calm. The amount of purchases by various gangs is listed below. Inland 112 Ningbo 11 Nanyang 50 Peers 15 Guangdong 25 Shantou 20 Luzhou 5</p>
<p>The cotton market showed no signs of improvement. American cotton tended to go downstream again. The yarn market was sluggish. Silver root was relatively tight. Cotton merchants from Shandong, Zhengzhou, Tianjin, and other producing areas had a saying of coming to Shanghai to sell short. However, the buyers still had a strong intention to do more because the bottom goods were exhausted and the foreign cotton adoption calculation was not feasible.</p>
<p>Zheng Mark's Step-by-Step Loosening</p>
<p>Zheng Mark's market opened in the morning. As the American cotton suddenly fell, the market atmosphere was particularly tired. However, there were not many sellers. Each month fell by 5 fen to 2 qian. In the afternoon, the market situation still showed no color. The far fall was 5 fen. The total transaction statistics for the whole day were 34,800 dan. It was found that Yifeng sold 3,900 dan, Tongxing 2,100 dan, Changfeng 1,100 dan, Yuanxingchang 1,100 dan, and Deji 3,500 dan. Yuanda bought 2,200 dan, Yuanda 2,100 dan, Ruida 2,500 dan, Mingde 800 dan, and Shenchang 800 dan. The closing price is listed below.

Spot money traded Shaanxi cotton 35.00 Dongmian Line entered 400 pieces Spot money traded American cotton's long positions settled back down</p>
<p>Indian and British Cotton The Situation Transformed</p>
<p>Yesterday, the American cotton market situation was mixed and uncertain. At first, it was strong and firm because of Wall Street. Later, it was tired because of the settlement of long positions. The futures fell by 13 to 15 pounds per tone, and the spot fell by 15 pounds per tone. British cotton futures rose by 8 points, and the spot rose by 7 points. Egyptian cotton spot rose by 5 points. Indian cotton rose initially with American cotton. Later, it softened due to sales by Japanese merchants and brokers. Pingguor rose by 2.5 rupees, Aomula rose by 1.75 rupees, and Bairoxi rose by 1.875 rupees. The original telegram recording is on the left.

There were only more than ten numbers. Various urban and rural shops were preparing for the year-end purchase. Therefore, the goods accumulated in Pudong saw tightness, and the price increased by three feet. The prices of Lu Yangxian followed. However, because the customers of Bo Dao were demanding and the sales were not smooth, the market situation for high-quality goods remained the same, while the medium and inferior qualities felt soft. Factory goods showed signs of repair, so they were not sold. The arrival of Yin Yuan goods was even more scarce, so the market situation was pulled up. (North Market) Yesterday, the 27 or 28 boats of various gangs arrived from the river downstream. The shops liked the white japonica, and the high, medium, and inferior qualities were slightly different. The market situation was tight for high-quality goods by several points, and the medium and inferior qualities increased by one or two jiao. The arrival of rice was not much, and the sales continued to be good, and the price increased by nearly one foot. Du Yangjian Baiyuan's arrival was sparse, and the zero customers were quite active, and the price also increased by two or three feet. Yang Jian's price increased by one foot. The arrival of early rice Yin Yuan was scarce, and the customers from outside the region were interested in the hoarders in this street.</p>
<p>The Long-Grain Machine Yuan Continued to Rise by Five Fen</p>
<p>Yesterday, two more batches of customer xian and customer yuan arrived, with more yuan rice. They were loaded from Wuhu, Hunan. Customer xian then Jiangxi slightly arrived at the port. Recently, the xian yuan in both markets has been popular due to the scarcity of goods. The customer yuan has been bought by Muji Street, and the situation is even better. Yesterday, the after-market on the new arrival saw a return to stability. However, in addition to the customers from the north and south helping, the rice shops and hoarders in this street were all interested in the customer yuan. Yesterday, 500 packages of Wuhu machine yuan and 538 packages of Hunan machine yuan were sold. The Wuyuan and Hunan round-grain yuan rice markets were stable. The long-grain Hunan yuan rice was stored and arrived less. The demand in this street was very high. Although there were new arrivals, the market situation continued to rise by five fen. The price was 9 yuan and 6 jiao and a half for long-grain Hunan yuan rice, 10 yuan to 9 yuan and 8 jiao and a half for round-grain Hunan yuan rice, and 9 yuan and 4 or 5 jiao for Wuhu machine yuan. It is estimated that 700 packages of Jiangxi machine rice were sold to Quanzhou and Fuzhou, priced at 9 yuan, 1 jiao, and 2 fen to 9 yuan. The market was also stable.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Grains Market Rises and Falls Unevenly</p>
<p>(Soybeans) Plain and unremarkable, it is difficult to have hope for development for a while. Local factories originally had an appetite, but unfortunately, the lunar New Year is approaching, so they had to temporarily return to watching. Therefore, even if there were transactions recently, they were only one or two cars. Yesterday, only one car of Yanhuaiguan was traded. In addition, Chefang from the inland helped to handle one car of Dalian beans and one car of Zhengyangguan beans. No other gangs were involved. (Mung Beans) Shanghai's inventory is scarce, and the price is as firm as before. If the customer appetite turns weak within the year, the market price will not continue to increase. Otherwise, there will be few goods and strong sales, and the supply and demand will be uneven. There is still hope for prosperity in the coming spring. Yesterday, a total of 200 packages of Guandian large-grain Ming mung beans and 1,200 packages of small-grain Ming mung beans were traded, all handled by the Guang gang. (Red Beans) There is also a way to foreign Zhuang, and the market is stable. Yesterday, 280 packages</p>
<h3>Beijing-Shanghai Railway Adds Shanghai-Changzhou Commuter Train</h3>
<p>Timetable Change for Shanghai-Suzhou Commuter Train</p>
<p>The Beijing-Shanghai Railway Traffic Department, in view of the fact that at the end of each lunar year, passenger traffic on the line is extremely crowded, mostly due to merchants and laborers returning home for the New Year, especially between Shanghai and Changzhou, where the original third and fourth-class carriages are often insufficient, has decided to temporarily add the 15th and 16th third and fourth-class Shanghai-Changzhou commuter trains starting from the 15th of this month, one round trip per day, to alleviate congestion. The 15th train departs from Shanghai North Station at 4:10 AM daily, arriving in Changzhou at 10:25 AM, stopping along the way at Tianfu'an, Kunshan, Zhengyi, Guanzhuangbi, Suzhou, Wangting, Zhoujinggang, Wuxi, Shitangwan, Luoshe, Henglin, Qishuyan, and other stations. The 16th train departs from Changzhou at 2:35 PM daily, arriving at Shanghai North Station at 8:40 PM, stopping at all stations along the way. In addition, the 24th third and fourth-class Shanghai-Suzhou commuter train on the line will also change its timetable from the same day, departing from Wuxi at 3:10 PM daily and arriving at Shanghai North Station at 7:52 PM, it is said.</p>
<h3>New Pharmaceutical Industry Association Inquires with Warner Company</h3>
<p>Regarding Mr. Warren Shis's Essay</p>
<p>The New Pharmaceutical Industry Association sent a letter to the American company Warner, stating that the September issue of the "New York Affairs Monthly" published an essay by Mr. Warren Shis, titled "China Plays with the Ignorant," which supported Japan's military policy on the Manchurian issue, stating that Manchuria needed elimination and that Japan's occupation was not necessarily bad. It was noted that Mr. Shis was a representative of the American company Warner, which sells perfumes and medicines in China. Reading this, we are quite surprised. As the Japanese disregard international law and disrupt peace in East Asia, they are not only hated by our people but also intolerable by world public opinion. Since this gentleman is doing business in China, he should not publish unreasonable and anti-public opinion articles to advocate for the Japanese. We would like to know if this Warren Shis is indeed a representative of your company, and we request a reply, etc.</p>

<h3>Ten Years Later (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— And</p>
<p>Before my eyes was a luxurious high-rise building. I walked inside and stopped in front of a room on the far side of the hall. I knew this was the new room to meet, and I lifted the door curtain [tap! tap!] and tapped on the door with my fingers.</p>
<p>"Who is it?" A clear, sweet voice came from inside.</p>
<p>"It's me. Someone you knew before."</p>
<p>The door opened.</p>
<p>Standing there in a black satin-covered fur coat and skirt that reached all the way to her ankles, she looked every inch a young woman. She was startled to see me and took steps back, back, until she reached the bed. I glanced around the room: embroidered curtains with flower patterns, soft, shimmering drapes, brand-new bedding and furniture... All the luxurious furnishings dazzled my eyes. A subtle fragrance filled my nostrils. Only then did I notice the neatly folded cotton quilt on the bed, with its harmonious colors.</p>
<p>"You...where did you come from? I don't recognize you!" Suddenly, she said this, her strange eyes fixed on my face.</p>
<p>"Don't say that, young lady! I'm the one you used to call 'brother' years ago."</p>
<p>"Brother? You're the 'brother'?" she asked shrilly, immediately raising both hands to cover her cheeks.</p>
<p>"Yes, it's me."</p>
<p>"Please take off your glasses!" she said with suspicion.</p>
<p>I quickly removed the glasses from the bridge of my nose.</p>
<p>"Ah!" She sat down on the edge of the bed and hastily pulled open the curtain, covering herself. But she immediately released it, "[You] shouldn't come to our room..."</p>
<p>"(Who is 'them'?) I don't know. I only know you!"</p>
<p>"Yes, you don't know anymore...I already belong to a man you don't know."</p>
<p>"So you look down on me and don't recognize me anymore?"</p>
<p>"Maybe..." She hesitated, but suddenly changed her mind: "It's not like that at all. If you knew my bitterness... First, I haven't seen you in ten years. Second, I came here entirely against my own will..."</p>
<p>"Please don't misunderstand! I have no bad intentions in finding you today. I just want to ask you one thing: Is there still any trace in your heart of the person you called 'brother' ten years ago? Please answer this and give a home to a lonely soul standing before you!"</p>
<p>"You're forcing me to die!" she suddenly sobbed. "You're simply forcing me to die!"</p>
<p>"Crying? Who's afraid of you! Women always play this trick!" Fiery stars flashed in my head.</p>
<p>"A trick? You are accusing me?"</p>
<p>This trick of women is really effective, and I ended up using my handkerchief to wipe away her tears.</p>
<p>"Young lady! Please understand me, I have no power to force you to die. Don't make it difficult for someone who has been wandering the world for ten years! Please choose a path for him to take: a path of despondency and degradation, or a path of striving and struggle?"</p>
<p>"You've already struggled for ten years. Do you still need a woman to decide the path you take from now on?" Her expression was that of an innocent younger sister questioning her older brother. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>"Unshin Pond" and "Mochou Lake"</h3>
<p>— Yang Xingzhi</p>
<p>There is a pond in Tokyo, Japan, called "Unshin Pond" (Impatient Pond): in our Nanjing, there is a lake called "Mochou Lake" (No Sorrow Lake). Every time we think of Unshin Pond and Mochou Lake, we can easily associate them with the differences in the national character of China and Japan.</p>
<p>Because of "impatience," they are constantly striving, constantly fighting, constantly striving to win the future through their own efforts. In 1853, a few American black ships broke through their tightly closed doors and forced them to sign unequal treaties. They then rose up to carry out the Meiji Restoration. In less than sixty years, they finally squeezed onto the throne of imperialists and became the evil hegemon that today dominates East Asia and casts a covetous eye on the world. In 1923, a major earthquake struck, and the prosperous Tokyo was almost completely reduced to rubble. They then rose up to fight against nature, rebuilding a prosperous Tokyo from the rubble. Now, Tokyo is even more prosperous than it was in 1923.</p>
<p>This is the "impatient" national character of Japan, and it is also the beautiful fruit harvested by the impatient national character.</p>
<p>Because of "no sorrow," we have been living in procrastination and complacency for many years, taking each day as it comes and living with indifference. On a small scale, we don't care if we don't have food to eat tomorrow; on a large scale, we don't care if the country will be destroyed tomorrow. We leave everything to be dictated by the environment. If others want Shenyang, we retreat to Jinzhou; if others want Jinzhou, we retreat to Shanhaiguan. For the past hundred years, we have been living under the whip of others in this way with indifference, and we still dance and entertain... "Singing girls are unaware of the hatred of a fallen nation, still singing 'Backyard Flowers' across the river" is the most practical praise of the "no sorrow" national character. Today, we have finally created the so-called national crisis. The harvest of this evil fruit is naturally due to the evil cause planted by the "no sorrow" national character.</p>
<p>Some say that "impatience" is narrow-minded and intolerant, and that only "no sorrow" can be considered the demeanor of a great power. But we have now reached a point where we can no longer afford not to worry, and we should also rouse our spirits and fight once!</p>
<h3>The Third Shackle of Women</h3>
<p>— Wu Zeyi</p>
<p>In the preface to his famous book "Woman and Socialism," Bebel said that modern "women really bear two shackles. First, because women are socially subordinate to men, they cannot but groan in an inferior social position. Legal formal equality can only alleviate their suffering, not fundamentally solve it. Second, women suffer from economic subordination. This is the general state of women, and like the proletarian men, it is the common destiny of the proletariat." Now, we have discovered the "third shackle of women," which is their clothing.</p>
<p>"Clothing" is less about loving beauty oneself, and more about pleasing others. During the mating season of birds and beasts, they generally have beautiful plumage and shiny fur to attract their opponents. As for humans, in the beginning, when the marital relationship between men and women was determined by women choosing men, it was not women who decorated themselves, but men. But since the patriarchy replaced the matriarchy and marriage by abduction became prevalent, men conquered women. Not only was the right to choose a spouse in the hands of men, but women had no choice but to live a parasitic life under the love of men. Under these circumstances, the scope of women's activities was naturally extremely limited. In order to reduce the monotony of life and please her husband, she devoted herself wholeheartedly to decoration. The more beautiful she decorated herself, the more she could grasp her man's heart. Concentrating all of life's activities on decoration, this shackle has suppressed the progress of women's intelligence for thousands of years.</p>
<p>Especially in the leisure class, husbands or fathers often consciously encourage their wives and daughters to pay attention to clothing in order to flaunt their wealth and carnal pleasures, causing women to lose all sense of time, confidence in the improvement of life, and self-esteem. As a result, a delicate wife or young lady in a "puppet family" is created.</p>
<p>It is very common for ladies to spend an hour or two applying powder or perming their hair once. Which time do three women meet without talking about fashion styles and the size of their clothes?</p>
<p>Therefore, instead of talking about high-sounding women's movements, we should first drag women out of their disrespectful clothing.</p>
<h3>Soviet Clothing</h3>
<p>— Li Li</p>
<p>If you lived in the Soviet Union, then questions like, "What kind of clothes do the ladies in Paris wear? How do they comb their hair? What kind of perfume do they use? What kind of powder do they pat on?" would never be mentioned in front of you.</p>
<p>Overseas Anecdotes, page 5, compiled by China Fuxin Tobacco Company.</p>
<p>In the Soviet Union, you can wear any kind of clothes you want. Everyone does. There is no so-called "seasonal clothing," only two kinds of clothing: for hot weather and for cold weather.</p>
<p>No matter where you are in the Soviet Union, even in the Bolshoi Theatre in Moscow, you will not see women with gorgeous clothes, shining jewelry, or long evening gowns. But they, men and women, are all lively and cheerful, and they all wear light and clean outer clothing.</p>
<p>In the Soviet Union, there are no "fashion magazines," no articles in newspapers discussing clothing, and no stores that advertise clothes. Radio broadcasts never talk about clothing and grooming issues.</p>
<p>Moreover, if you lived in the Soviet Union, you probably still haven't worn silk stockings. In the Soviet Union, eight or nine out of ten women always wear thin cotton socks, usually in light gray, earth tones, white, or black. If a woman spends her whole day studying clothing and grooming, everyone will definitely regard her as a disrespectful plaything.</p>
<p>As for the clothing of Soviet men, such as lightweight outer clothing, it is an interesting kind of clothing. The upright collar is often decorated with artificial embroidery, and the buttons are always sewn on the left side. Many men always wear this kind of clothing, with a cap made by a national factory on their heads.</p>
<h3>Air-Propelled Car</h3>
<p>— Hong Xingchi</p>
<p>[Tested in Detroit, Michigan, USA]</p>
<p>To climb very slippery ice mountains, we only need a clever air-propelled car. This car has four blades, like the blades of an airplane's propeller, powered by a 100-horsepower engine. The bottom of the car is equipped with wheels. The car body is 132 inches wide and weighs 1,500 pounds. This novel car can travel eight miles per hour, and one gallon of fuel can travel thirty miles.</p>
<p>Because the wheels do not propel the car body and can rotate freely without having to be fixed to the ground like ordinary cars, this air-propelled car can drive on muddy ground or slippery mountains as easily as on flat ground. When driving extremely fast, the front of the car tilts upward, and the strong wind generated by the blades can press it down. The blades are surrounded by a steel wire mesh to prevent accidents.</p>
<p>According to the inventor's report on the test results, an air-propelled car with five-foot blades, carrying six or eight people, is four times faster than ordinary wheel-driven cars. A model car carrying three people is currently being designed and manufactured, and it is expected that one gallon of gasoline can travel forty miles, with a maximum speed of two miles per minute, and there will be no danger of tipping over.</p>

<h3>Crossroads of the Era and Love (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Zhang Ziping</p>
<p>Madam Tsuruko saw that the cover of this magazine had no aesthetic appeal at all, and was just terribly red. She flipped through the contents, and there were not many literary works, most of them were theoretical articles. She was not interested and put the magazine back. She walked to Haiquan's bedside again, lingering and reluctant to leave. Under the electric light, Haiquan's face was a little pale, but his intense masculine beauty seemed to have a kind of temptation for her. At the same time, imagining the pure, hot blood in his blood vessels, her chest beat inexplicably rapidly.</p>
<p>The more she looked at this young man in his sleep, the more she felt that he had a kind of charm. Several times she almost lost her self-control, wanting to spontaneously crawl into his quilt and hug him tightly.</p>
<p>[What if] he woke up and rejected himself, how embarrassing that would be!</p>
<p>Thinking of this, it was like a bucket of cold water poured on her back, and she shuddered all over, and she busily restrained herself.</p>
<p>[It's better to wake him up in a proper and high-sounding manner, and see what he means.]</p>
<p>She was about to carry out this plan, but when she thought about his temper, she was a little disappointed. Because the result of implementing this proper plan was foreseeable, that is, as soon as he woke up and saw herself standing in front of his bed, he would rudely ask, "What are you here to disturb me for?"</p>
<p>Such an unartistic, expressionless, scientific question would be embarrassing for a woman. This future Bachelor of Science never spoke politely or used rhetoric to embellish his words.</p>
<p>But the imagination of that youthful, fresh blood was still tempting her. Firstly, because her husband had been away from her for nearly three weeks, she had long wanted to capture this future Bachelor of Science as her captive on a physiological level. Secondly, because she knew that her husband's trip south was entirely for another woman, 丨one might say her enemy,丨 this would promote her jealous retaliation. She stood and thought for a moment, looking for reasons to justify her out-of-bounds actions tonight. But no matter what, she could not deny that she was being deceived by her own love of lower instincts.</p>
<p>[This young man's attitude is really impossible for me to deal with... In recent days, he has completely misunderstood himself. Let him wake up and explain it to him clearly.] She looked at Haiquan's sleeping face and thought. She saw a kind of sublime charm on his face. Although she had rich experiences in sexual love, reaching middle age, she had never obtained a satisfying love. She had an unspeakable passion for this young man丨a passion that would overflow at the slightest opportunity. It had been more than three months since she met him. His detached attitude only made her more and more frustrated, and it also prevented her from expressing her full passion to him.</p>
<p>Just at this moment, she saw a soft smile on his pale face. She was startled, thinking that he had woken up. But only for a moment did the soft smile on his face disappear. She knew that he was in a pleasant dream.</p>
<p>At this moment, she discovered another strange thing, there was a letter with a vermillion envelope on his pillow. Curiosity, 丨 no, actually a kind of jealousy 丨 forced her to reach out and check it out.</p>
<p>"Please have the elder sister forward this to Mr. Lin Haiquan, from your sister Fengzhu with thanks."</p>
<p>Madam Tsuruko knew who gave him the letter, and at the same time felt a burst of jealousy. She wanted to take out the contents and read it.</p>
<p>"No! This is an immoral act! If he knows it, he will look down on me. Don't learn the special behaviour of the Chinese, who specialise in infringing on the freedom and rights of others!"</p>
<p>Thinking this, she busily put the letter back on his pillow. At the same time, she breathed a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>"In any case, I can't let him go!"</p>

<h3>Bandit Robbery and Marriage</h3>
<p>— Zhan Lu</p>
<p>The Book of Changes is a wonderful book, and these four words [bandit robbery and marriage] are especially wonderful; what is so wonderful about it? It is wonderful that a robbery occurred in the Sham Shui Po area of Hong Kong on January 2 this year, which almost perfectly explains [bandit robbery and marriage].</p>
<p>The owner of Yung Kee Preserved Meat Shop burned incense and lit candles in front of the door, burning a large amount of spirit money, mumbling in prayer:</p>
<p>[Friend! It's not that I'm forcibly taking your wife! It's that she's coming to marry me because she's under the pressure of life! Before our wedding night, I'll compensate you with a large sum of spirit money, please use it yourself, and don't come here to pester me!]</p>
<p>The half-century-old boss, Xie Hua, married a twenty-eight-year-old widowed woman, Zhang Mei, as his wife. The merchant's superstition had not been broken, and he was wary of her former husband's spirit coming to cause trouble. He was not in a hurry to fulfil his beautiful dream, but thought of making peace with the ghost; only after the prayer was completed did he close the door and return to the bridal chamber to fulfil the important work of a new groom.</p>
<p>Who knew that a loud knocking sound broke their beautiful dream! Xie Hua put on his clothes and got up to ask, but all he heard outside was a chorus of [Open the door quickly!]</p>
<p>At this time, Xie's mind was filled with doubts. Just after finishing burning the spirit money, there was this strange knocking sound. Was it a person? Was it a ghost? It became a problem, just like what was said in the Romance of the West Chamber: [If it's a person, speak quickly; if it's a ghost, vanish quickly.]</p>
<p>[Come to buy preserved meat!] a voice outside the door said.</p>
<p>The words "preserved meat" opened the two doors wide. Xie Hua, who valued profit, thought that a customer had come. Hmph! What a good customer! A group of three men rushed in, not to buy preserved meat, but to tie up Xie Hua like he was regularly made into preserved meat with ropes. The bride, who was not wearing any clothes, hid in the quilt and did not make a sound, and they ransacked her chests and cabinets, taking away gold and jewellery worth hundreds of dollars, before leaving in a hurry!</p>
<p>Afterwards, Zhang Mei got out of bed and released the tightly bound preserved meat! Her husband. Xie Hua released the list of lost items and reported to the Sham Shui Po Police Station to capture the bandits overnight, but they caught nothing; The police station therefore suspected that this sister had not been bound by the three bandits, so they immediately detained her for strict investigation, and now the truth has not yet [come to light].</p>
<p>Try to explain each of the four words [bandit robbery and marriage]. [Bandit] is a bandit, [marriage] is the married person, and both the words [robbery] and [marriage] are used as verbs, then these four words are really an excellent inscription on a pleasure map of Xie's boss.</p>
<h3>The Grief of the Goose</h3>
<p>— Hong Yushu</p>
<p>丨Unable to cry or laugh丨</p>
<p>A flock of geese flying in a long snake formation from the northeast, galloping across the sky, could not help but give people a special impression. Admiring their perseverance in weathering the storm and their great spirit of unity, [Geese] can always be said to be like a noble and melancholic patriotic man! It is said that geese are indeed a kind of bird that loves to be in groups the most. If a goose leaves the united front; or falls behind, it will mourn constantly, starve and wait to die. Comparing this with the military men with great knowledge; who often turn into tragic dramas of infighting and mutual killing due to trivial matters, it can be said that humans are not as good as birds.</p>
<p>Listening to its sobbing sound, because they are living in the frontier, they have passed through the puppet state. Its air route may have had a brief encounter with the violent Japanese iron birds (airplanes), spent a life of national subjugation, and looked down on the people in the lost territory of the Northeast being trampled alive by iron hooves. Relying only on the isolated and helpless volunteer army, struggling to deal with the strong enemy, so they could not bear to sit idly by and watch the country fall. They resolutely reorganized the team and entered the customs, calling out like a cuckoo spitting blood as if carrying the mission of the volunteer army, to beg for help from the people of the country. But I wonder if the sad tone can be blown into the ears of the adults and gentlemen who sing the high-pitched tune of saving the country? As the saying goes [Geese] cry when they leave the pass and laugh when they enter. Now it is really unable to cry or laugh. (Rewarded)</p>
<h3>Urban Sketches</h3>
<p>— Guo Lanxin</p>
<p>丨What phenomenon is this?丨</p>
<p>I was walking on the road in the current of ten thousand people like the sea.</p>
<p>The newspapers in the hands of the newspaper sellers were printed with eye-catching large characters, and the newspaper sellers were shouting the news that North China was in urgent danger and Shanhaiguan had fallen.</p>
<p>The people on the road, mostly women, were all dressed up, with white powder, puffy hair, red lips, lively eyes, long cheongsams, high heels, and fur coats. The men followed behind like orderlies, and no one paid attention to the news that the newspaper sellers were shouting, as if they were calling out for goods on the road.</p>
<p>Arriving in front of the cinema, I saw modern songs and dances, the scent of flesh and the spillage of blood, and both the upper and lower floors were full. On the billboard, many people were buying tickets for the next show.</p>
<p>The cheers of drunken and satiated diners floated out from the windows facing the street of the restaurant. At the entrance of the restaurant, three drunks were awakening, just rolled over and prepared to get up, listening to several things in the room, as if they were racing in the room, jumping loudly on the floor board,</p>
<p>I want to make your husband timid, and you will definitely think that they are ghosts, and be scared. However, without boasting 丨丨I guessed that they were mice. I thought of the hole in the corner of the room that I saw during the day, and it must have come in from there. I turned on the light, jumped out of bed, first went to the corner of the room to block the hole, then grabbed a kitchen knife, and desperately chased the mouse around the room, and as a result, although I ate more and slept an hour less that night, the mouse's head was indeed cut off by me.</p>
<p>The following nights were indeed quiet. I thought that it was the price of my efforts, and I smiled in my heart.</p>
<p>Until recently, it seemed that I often woke up and heard something dancing on the floor again. My wife was afraid of the cold. She was also afraid that I would be frozen, so she didn't allow me to be so brave and work hard to kill the mice again. Although we both clearly heard the mice gnawing at the cured meat on the wall.</p>
<p>The next morning, I got up and saw that a hole was lost in the cured meat. But when I heard the mouse sound again that night, my wife said: Let it eat at most one more hole, there are so many cured meat, what are we afraid of. It's better not to delay sleeping.</p>
<p>On the third night, the mice gnawed the meat again. My wife still said the same old thing: There is so much cured meat, how can the little mice finish eating it, at most there will be another hole tomorrow; it is still better not to delay sleeping. This time I couldn't get up again. In my heart, I thought:</p>
<p>Just need a little effort, you can drive the mouse away. But you have to be afraid of the cold, greedy for sleep, and let the cured meat lose a hole, and then a hole. Maybe after sleeping two more times, the cured meat will be gone...</p>
<p>The beggars with cold faces and shivering bodies begged for food from the friends who were drunken and satiated as they stepped out of the restaurant. One said no, one said annoying, and one said get out of the way.</p>
<p>Mr. Sun, who borrowed money from the bank, was holding his modern mistress, and carried many things out of Wing On Company. At the same time, they were eating chocolate candy.</p>
<p>At the railway station, a country man was crying silently because he didn't know when his money was gone. Many people surrounded him, making meaningless chuckles and uncaring pity, and finally everyone dispersed.</p>
<p>I was walking on the road in the current of ten thousand people like the sea.</p>
<h3>Magnificent Picture of Zongcheng</h3>
<h3>Rats—Suke Xun</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>丨You must not tolerate them丨</p>
<p>I remember that it was only two days after we moved here, and one night in the middle of the night, I was awakened by the urine Japanese ate the three northeastern provinces, nibbled at Shanghai, and now they are biting at Shanhaiguan, and we Chinese sleeping scholars may still want to sleep on...</p>
<h3>Small Gardening: Plum Blossoms by Huang Hai Ke</h3>
<p>In the deep winter season of wind and snow, all flowers and all trees are dying or withered. Only the plum tree stands tall and independent, fighting against the wind and snow. Moreover, it blooms with fragrant flowers, surpassing pines and cypresses in vibrant color and abundant vitality. Therefore, I believe it is most appropriate to make the plum blossom our national flower.</p>
<p>The plum is originally a tropical tree, produced in southern regions such as Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, Guangdong, and Guangxi. It can both bloom and bear fruit, serving both for viewing and practical use. Furthermore, it is not particular about the soil. Whether it is sandy, yellow, mountainous, or barren land, it can be planted. Regardless of the warm or cold climate, sunny or shady aspects, it will naturally bloom when it's time to bloom, and naturally bear fruit when it's time to bear fruit, never failing its season. The flowers come in red, white, single-petaled, and multiple-petaled varieties. There is also a slightly green variety called the Green Calyx Plum. Southern plums mostly bear fruit, while northern apricot plums and elm plums only bloom and do not bear fruit, serving only for people's enjoyment. The fruits vary in size.</p>
<p>The most famous places for viewing plum blossoms in Jiangnan are Dengwei in Suzhou, Chaoshan in Zhejiang, and Luofu in Guangdong. During the blooming season, tourists flock there in droves. Chaoshan has the Song Plum, which is widely praised. Dengwei's plum-producing area is called "Fragrant Snow Sea," which is also well-known. However, in recent years, farmers have found that planting plum trees is not very profitable, so they have mostly switched to planting mulberry trees and other flowering trees. What a scene to spoil!</p>
<p>In the past, people loved plums, with Lin Hejing being the most famous. He was known for "taking plum blossoms as his wife and cranes as his children," which was admired throughout history. His tomb is on Gushan (Solitary Hill) in West Lake, so the mountain is also full of plum trees, embodying a sense of solitary appreciation. Throughout history, there have been countless poets and painters who have praised and painted plum blossoms. There are countless good poems, good paintings, and good articles. As a child, I read Gong Ding'an's "Record of the Sick Plum Pavilion," which I can still recite fluently. In painting, I especially love Jin Dongxin's works, which are antique and leave a deep impression.</p>
<p>During the Ming Dynasty, there was a famous scholar named Zhang Dafu who loved plum blossoms the most. He had a "Plum Blossom Thatched Cottage Collection," and his notes were witty and delightful. He wrote particularly many texts about plums, such as: "The plum tree in the courtyard is about to bloom, but one branch is twisted. I wanted to unfold the small branches on it, but the calyxes are already abundant, and I couldn't bear to do it. Someone said: 'You should prune it quickly to concentrate its energy.' Boys playfully threw fertilizer water on it, and the flowers bloomed splendidly, large and round. Those nourished at the roots are like Mao Qiang and Xi Shi in the harem. They face the morning sun and glow like floating clouds, but they are destined to grow old on the riverbank, preserving their unique character alone. Alas!"</p>
<p>About an old plum tree: "The old plum tree is withering and about to die. You respect and care for the jade butterfly plum tree, and you want to replace it. I hesitated and couldn't bear to do it. After several days, there were shoots on the branches, so I planted the jade butterfly plum tree here, just a step away. Although it was just budding, it didn't wither. Now, it suddenly forms a shade with several flowers, like snow intertwining with branches, and silk growing in the leaves. The summer rain sprinkles down, and nothing leaks through. I stood there for a long time, and the wind sent moisture away."</p>
<p>About the plum tree in the courtyard: "The plum blossoms in the courtyard are suppressed by the overcast rain, and their half-makeup stops. This morning, the color is pleasing, and the flowers are blooming like snow. Swarms of bees make nighttime sounds. I playfully took last year's gift of words and ordered the debtor to sing it quickly, and ordered more wine. Monk Ru boasted that my mountain had ten thousand trees, but how can it compare to this three-foot land of fragrant snow?"</p>
<p>About the green plum: "Among the varieties of plum blossoms, the green calyx is the most precious, but I have never seen a thousand-petaled green plum. Last year, on the twenty-ninth day of the lunar month, I encountered it south of Wei Lian's house. Its strange fragrance and fresh green color were intensely captivating. I lit a candle to illuminate it, and its radiance floated. At that time, there was Wu Sheng playing the lute, Shen Sheng playing the flute, and 圶 Sheng playing the flute. I usually don't understand drinking wine, but I got completely drunk. Now, a year has suddenly passed. The cold has turned, and the plum calyxes are blooming again. I happened to think of that place, and I told Wang Weilie of Yushan. He immediately wrote a painting and sent it to me, ordering his son to hang it and visit Dongshan 𡵚 to appreciate it. I felt the fragrance coming from the wall. It was the first day of Dingwei." Such wonderful writings are truly worth reading hundreds of times.</p>
<p>The wintersweet is a separate branch of the plum blossom, with yellow petals and a red or yellow center. The one with a yellow center is called the plain wintersweet, which is more precious. Mr. Zhang also has a passage that is very well written: "The wintersweet is blooming splendidly, and its floating fragrance goes straight to the simple nature. Sitting under the lattice window, I secretly imagine a ruler's worth of yellow jade in the sea tide mansion, suddenly filling the courtyard. Thus, I know that when things are quiet, life arises, and nature flows smoothly. Even if flowers spread out and face the enemy, they cannot overcome the tranquility of the roots. Recently, in Loudong, I transplanted a pot of daffodils, and now I have these flowers surrounding me. Wouldn't the year's events be accomplished?" △△△△△</p>

<h3>Heartache</h3>
<p>— By Hong Shou Juan</p>
<p>This unexpected situation naturally startled the Bu Fang Sheng couple greatly. Unisonally, they exclaimed, "Oh dear!" Especially the timid and childish Mrs. Li Fang Sheng, who was almost scared to tears.</p>
<p>At that moment, the couple had no time to ask what was going on. One hurriedly closed the door, while the other, helping and pulling, carried his snow-covered body into the inner room. One anxiously asked if he was alright, while the other urgently checked his breathing and felt his chest. One quickly said, "Go brew some ginger soup!" and the other replied, "Or brandy!" One hastily gathered dry clothes, and the other hurriedly lit the heater. In this hasty situation, they forgot to wake up the only servant in the house. All matters were handled personally by the two of them. After a period of chaos, they gradually revived his frozen limbs, stagnant blood, and excessively fatigued muscles and nerves.</p>
<p>The two were so preoccupied with him that they didn't bother to button up their own clothes, nor did they notice the midnight cold.</p>
<p>An hour later, he and the Dong Fang Sheng couple were sitting around in a small and exquisite room. The dim lamplight reflected the burning fire, and an air of warmth, similar to early spring, filled the room. No matter how harsh the cold, it could not easily penetrate here.</p>
<p>At this moment, he was wrapped in a newly made otter-collared sea tiger skin cloak belonging to his friend, leaning back in a warm chair close to the stove. Brandy and mutton tallow, along with three or five other dishes, were spread out on a small table beside him. He was blissfully, softly, and comfortably floating as if he were in a new eiderdown quilt at dawn in spring, his thoughts floating among the clouds. Other than a slight numbness in his nerves, all his limbs and bones felt relaxed and comfortable. He found the soft lamplight in the room particularly pleasing, as if it were a long-lost friend, and his drowsy gaze was fixed on it unblinking. He recalled the situation just moments ago, wondering if he was dreaming. Just an hour earlier, his circumstances had been completely different. He was bewildered, unable to believe that within the span of one or two hours, there could be two absolutely different situations in the same world.</p>
<p>As he was in a daze, the sound of the wind outside continued to roar, as if angry at not being able to seize him. The window frames rattled strangely, like the trembling of his bones just moments ago. Although the wind and snow outside could no longer harm his body, the terrible sound still made his spirit uneasy. Moreover, he could not understand how he had been able to break free from this overwhelming storm. (Four)</p>

<h3>Good People and Bad People</h3>
<p>— Tian Fang</p>
<p>Right and wrong, good and evil, are truly difficult matters to discern, because "right and wrong" arise in relation to each other and are not absolute, and "good and evil" have no fixed standard. Likes and dislikes differ greatly. Moreover, in this completely dark society, distinguishing between good people and bad people is truly foolish and naive.</p>
<p>But within this, there seems to be a logic, that is, the strong are always good people, and the weak are always bad people. Those with status and power are good people, and those without status or power are bad people. This is an unchanging truth.</p>
<p>The first example: When someone holds a high position and their power is burning hot, they are flawless and perfect. But once their power declines and they step down, letters and telegrams accuse them, and at least ten charges can be brought against them. It seems that all these crimes were committed overnight before they stepped down. Otherwise, why was nothing heard of them beforehand? Yesterday's loyal comrade suddenly transforms into a public enemy of the nation? The situation is a bit comical. I remember when a certain president of a court stepped down, a certain minister sent a telegram revealing that when he was in charge of finance in Wuhan, he had embezzled a certain amount of public funds. A certain important figure was appointed as the superintendent of the Jianghai Customs after serving as the mayor. After serving as superintendent for several months, he drifted away to Guangdong. Then, newspapers reported the news of a million dollars in public funds being embezzled. Recently, there have been rumors that a certain superintendent of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company accepted a bribe of 700,000. Because someone was a popular figure yesterday, they have become a fugitive today. I don't blame these corrupt officials for doing things so secretly. I only blame the news media for being so slow to report, not telling us earlier, but only firing cannons after the fact. We, who often pride ourselves as the bosses of the Republic of China, are actually like the junior clerks in a candle shop, to put it in Shanghai dialect, because we are outsiders and have never checked the accounts. We don't know if the inside story is true or false. In the end, the strict investigation ends up not being conducted, and eventually, they meet again, and past grievances are forgiven. The so-called ten major crimes at this point seem to be jokes made while drunk, not to be believed. The attitude of the bigwigs makes it impossible for us to recognize who is a good person and who is a bad person. This is clear evidence that the presence or absence of power and influence determines the shift between good and bad.</p>
<p>The second example: After Japan occupied our Northeast, our government did not dare to send troops to resist, nor did it dare to openly prepare for war and deploy defenses, as if doing something secretive. But Japan spoke eloquently, seemingly acting for the sake of justice and East Asian peace, that it had no choice but to take over China. Although the various countries did not say that China was "completely bad," they were "almost bad." Did the League of Nations investigation report not discuss China's internal affairs not being in order, the inappropriateness of nationalistic education, and the even more inappropriate anti-Japanese boycott? It can be seen that Japan was "acting on behalf of heaven," while China was completely a bad person. But I think, what if China was replaced by the United States?</p>
<p>The third example is those who abandon their parents, wives, and children and risk their lives to become kidnappers are certainly heinous bad people, while those who have vast wealth and live in luxury are certainly good people because they don't kidnap and don't even think about it.</p>
<p>There are many examples that can be extrapolated. Therefore, although the essence of right and wrong, good and evil, may be unknowable to us, we can recognize the general good people and bad people through their status and power.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Journey</h3>
<p>— Yi Kong</p>
<p>Sixteen masts arrive, sea routes connect, trade occurs with all nations, the sea ban is lifted, commercial warfare intensifies, Shanghai rises in the East of Asia. After the Opium War, the port was opened, Chinese and Western goods gradually filled in. Ninety years of daily advances and monthly strides have enabled it to develop into what it is today. The two-mile foreign concessions compete in prosperity, surpassing New York and Paris. Who holds the commercial hegemony? Japanese, American, French, and British capitalists. The capitalists are wealthy and noble, with jade balustrades, pearl curtains, and golden houses. Cars come and go in droves, morning and evening, they strive for the utmost extravagance. Delicacies from mountains and seas fill the kitchen, all of which are the fat of the laboring class. They are all round-headed and square-footed, but some are fish and meat, and some are knives. A thousand barrels of jade liquor are provided for drinking, all of which is the blood of the Chinese nation. Alas, for the 400 million people, they are sinking deeper and deeper into the abyss. When the national crisis is at hand, the enemy comes, and the January 28th battle begins. Countless lives are devastated, and the prosperity of Zhabei is reduced to ashes. The Nineteenth Route Army can resist, cutting through enemy lines and seizing flags, their courage is unmatched. After fighting fiercely for a fortnight, the enemy's courage falters, and the sovereignty of this place is preserved. Try to look at China from this place, and all you see is sorrow on the rivers and mountains. Under the railways of imperialism, who knows how many ghosts wail. The economic pressure is immense, and the weak are preyed upon by the strong, a truly tragic situation. Where are the heroes of today who can save this multitude? The wind blows from ten thousand miles, and the earth wails, and the Shanghai concessions rented out are not yet recovered. The Chinese nation is still like this, so when will the world of great harmony come?</p>
<h3>Science</h3>
<h3>Sun Lamps and Ultraviolet Rays</h3>
<p>— Xin</p>
<p>The purpose of sun lamps is to use ultraviolet rays to prevent or cure certain diseases. It is a new contribution of modern scientific advancement to treatment.</p>
<p>Principle: We have long known that sunlight has the ability to kill bacteria, eliminating various skin disease microbes and providing us with the opportunity to disinfect with sunlight. But where does this ability come from? After repeated research by many scientists, it has been discovered that in addition to the red, orange, yellow, green, cyan, blue, and violet rays that make up white sunlight, there are also rays with extremely short wavelengths outside the violet range that are invisible to the eye, which give sunlight its disinfecting ability. Because its position is outside the violet range, it is called ultraviolet rays.</p>
<p>Therefore, some people say that to strengthen the body and prevent disease, one should sunbathe. However, the amount of ultraviolet rays that the sun emits reaching the Earth is not much, and it is easily absorbed when passing through the atmosphere. Furthermore, the sun can only be seen on sunny days. Even the sun in winter has lost its therapeutic ability. Therefore, artificially created extremely strong light is used to replace the sun, providing a large amount of ultraviolet rays.</p>
<p>Device: The main part of a sun lamp is the light-emitting lamp head. Because glass has the ability to block ultraviolet rays, quartz is used, heated to a temperature of over 3,600 degrees Celsius, and melted into an arc-shaped tube. The tube is filled with mercury vapor and sealed at both ends. Then, an electric current is passed through it, generating extremely strong light rich in ultraviolet rays. The voltage of the electric current is automatically adjusted by a transformer, so alternating current and direct current of 220 or 110 volts can be used. However, the pressure of a battery is too low to generate strong light.</p>
<p>Efficacy: Ultraviolet rays have three main therapeutic effects:</p>
<p>(1) Direct Bactericidal Action: It can kill microorganisms and several kinds of parasites. Therefore, it is often used to treat various skin diseases, such as sores and ringworm, as well as local tuberculosis. It can also increase the human body's resistance to microorganisms.</p>
<p>(2) Through the action of (Ergosterol27H42), it produces vitamin D. Our bodies rely entirely on vitamin D to maintain the two important elements of calcium and phosphorus. Otherwise, children will develop rickets and hand-foot convulsions. Therefore, if we lack vitamin D, we can often use ultraviolet irradiation to convert (Drgosterol) in the body into vitamin D. In other words, it can treat and prevent diseases such as rickets.</p>
<p>(3) Benign Inflammatory Reaction: The first time you irradiate with a sun lamp, red spots will appear on the skin due to stimulation. This is a sign of benign inflammation. At that time, it can excite the blood vessels, dilate them, allow blood to flow smoothly, and excite the brain</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>and youth glands, providing sufficient energy and complete development.</p>
<p>Notes: There are many things to pay attention to when using a sun lamp.</p>
<p>(1) Before irradiation, you must wear goggles to avoid strong light and direct ultraviolet radiation to the eyes. Otherwise, it will damage your eyesight. There must be small holes beside the glasses to allow air to circulate.</p>
<p>(2) Only irradiate five minutes after turning on the lamp. Because the amount of ultraviolet rays is not much at the beginning, and there is a risk of the lamp head suddenly bursting within five minutes.</p>
<p>(3) The first time you irradiate, the skin will be stimulated and small red spots will appear. This is benign inflammation and not a sign of illness. Do not be afraid. The red spots will fade in a day or two.</p>
<p>(4) The irradiation time should not be too long. The first irradiation should not exceed fifteen minutes at most. Then, increase it gradually, but the longest time should not exceed one hour.</p>
<h3>The Turn of the Year</h3>
<p>— Hua</p>
<p>As the end of the year approaches, A Da's mother is getting more and more anxious. The five yuan she begged from idle Ah Fu a month ago has long been spent. Now, the weather is even colder, and goose feather-like snow has fallen once. She still only has a thin little jacket on her body. Most of the days she shrinks in rags. Except for getting up at noon to find something to fill her and A Da's stomachs, she can't do anything. Originally, like her, she lost her parents early and met this indifferent husband. Added to that, she doesn't know any skills. Born into this kind of environment, of course, she can only sit and wait for death. Anxious as she is, she can't do anything about it.</p>
<p>Although she hopes every day that her father, He Da, will return in embroidered clothes and meat, as he said when he left, and take her to enjoy happiness, her hopes have never been realized for even a day. She thought of Ah Fu's debt collection, that devilish face, the crazy shouts of the rice shop's bill collector, which trembled her heart and tempted her reason. Sometimes she thought of becoming a nun, but she couldn't arrange for A Da. Sometimes she had the idea of ​​living by prostitution, but thinking of the contempt of the clansmen, she gradually dismissed it. She can't violate etiquette. She can't bear to abandon her son. She can't bear the embarrassment when her husband returns. She always wanders day by day, living that monotonous life.</p>
<p>But this year she understood, she made her final determination. She knew that the clansmen would not give her living expenses, and would rather watch her kneel and cry to those who are unrelated. She knew that they didn't think of her as one of them. They treat her like a servant, a slave, even like a beast. Only the flesh left by her own people, 丨A Da ah丨, is a member of the clan.</p>
<p>Firecrackers sent off an old year and replaced it with a new one. People abandoned the old and put on the new. Every family showed happiness, and every place was full of joy. Only He Da's family was quiet and no one was there.</p>
<p>Where did A Da go after all? He didn't go away. He was still shrunk in the rags, his eyes widened and filled with tears, staring blankly, blankly, at his loving mother hanging in front of the window, who had abandoned them for her own future.</p>
<h3>Bamboo Pole Experts</h3>
<p>— Ya Shi</p>
<p>At this time, I had just finished eating. I was washing my face in the dormitory. Mr. Ding, who is known as the king of comedians in the school, happened to run in. He started by saying that I had a real and interesting story to tell you. I asked what was so interesting. He said, "It's that big guy you saw last month. I never knew him before. He insisted that he went to school with me at ×× Middle School. I was afraid that I had forgotten. Since someone came to find you, it wouldn't be reasonable to refuse them, haha. Who knew he was a bamboo pole expert. He came that day to invite me to the theater to watch a movie. Seeing him so friendly, I couldn't refuse. So, I had to go along. Who knew that when we got to the door, he pretended to feel around in his pocket and said to me with his eyes: 'Oh, I forgot to bring my wallet at home. What should I do?' Seeing that he said he forgot, that's also a common thing. I quickly took out my wallet from my pocket and said, 'I have it, I have it.' Seeing me like this, he smiled and said, 'Brother, I'm really sorry today. I'll have to treat you another time.' From then on, either he invited me to watch a movie or he invited me to eat a big meal. But he only went to the destination. Either he forgot his wallet at home, or it was picked by a pickpocket on the way. He did this more than ten times. I always paid. Brother Ya, do you think I would keep being taken advantage of like this? Last Sunday, he came again. At that time, I thought of a clever plan. I thought in my heart: 'He's just right to come.' So I smiled at him and said: 'Brother, we used to eat simple things in small restaurants. Today, we must eat something better in a big restaurant.' Hearing this, he praised it. 'Excellent!' I immediately went to ×× Restaurant with him and ate five or six of the most seasonal expensive dishes. I was also full. Then, I shouted to the waiter to add two more good dishes. After the waiter left, I asked him, "Brother, sit for a moment. I'll go to the alley across the street to take a pee and I'll be right back." Haha. I wasn't going to take a pee. I ran back to school in one breath. This time, even if the wallet flew to the sky, I'm afraid he wouldn't succeed. Brother Ya, since I did this, he hasn't come to invite me again."</p>
<h3>Radish, Greens, and Tofu Soup</h3>
<p>— Chang Zi</p>
<p>China, the sick man of East Asia. National demise is imminent; and species extinction is probably not far off. There is an idiom that says: [If the people are strong, the country will be strong]. From this, we can know that the greatest reason for China's decline is the unhealthiness of the people. This time, the city's education bureau recognizes the biggest root cause —unhealthiness—so in recent times, it has been promoting the [Health Speaking Competition], making people pay attention to health matters. This is a good thing for weak China.</p>
<p>Yesterday was the citywide secondary school preliminary round. The high school department was in the Wuben Auditorium. Because I wanted to gain more health knowledge, I braved the long distance and took three trams to run to Wuben to listen to the health speeches.</p>
<p>We need to know that topics specifically restricted to health are indeed not easy to do, but there are many speech topics that are both novel and the content is very consistent with health. They make a great contribution to knowledge about how to make the body healthy. I don't dare hide what I know myself, so I'm announcing it to the public here.</p>
<p>One male student's topic was [Radish, Greens, and Tofu Soup]. He explained the ingredients contained in the three things very clearly. He said: [There are vitamins A, B, C, and G. 2. 2.]</p>
<p>Radish helps digestion, greens clear the blood, and the protein contained in tofu soup is more than beef. These three things are both economical and beneficial to the body. Why don't we eat them? One female student talked about [Bananas and Health]. She explained the banana's composition very thoroughly and said that it is a natural canned food and the most beneficial to the body in small fruits, so to make the body healthy, you should eat more bananas when eating fruit.</p>
<p>There was also someone who talked about [Problems of Youth]. I didn't hear this topic clearly because there was a particularly noisy sound in the venue at the time. In short, I say that sexual issues are considered very secret in China. And taboo issues. In fact, specifically speaking, to make young people's bodies healthy, there is a need to discuss this kind of issue.</p>
<p>There are many others who spoke very well. The so-called [Too many beautiful things to take in], I certainly cannot list them one by one. Generally speaking, the other speakers were all paying attention to talking about what diseases Chinese people have and methods of remediation. They also emphasized sports and hygiene.</p>
<p>I listened to these speeches on an empty stomach yesterday, which made me feel that what we can do in our daily lives that is beneficial to the body is to eat more radish, greens, and tofu soup when eating. When eating fruit, eat more bananas. Here, I would like to introduce it to the readers again.</p>
<h3>Idle Talk</h3>
<p>— Xuanwu</p>
<p>(1)</p>
<p>In the gym, on the soccer field...it's usually when tall, dark-haired, muscular guys are showing off their strength, hoping to get a few claps from the female students. But in the exam hall, it's the white-faced scholar, wearing old spectacles, hunched over, and unable to even tie up a chicken, who, when he shows his skills, gets a difficult question paper but hands in his answers early, walking out of the exam hall with a smug look on his face. How can the girls not be envious and anxious?</p>
<p>(2)</p>
<p>People say that most American books have a thick and beautiful cover but little in the way of profound principles or views inside. A British book has a thin cover and only a few pages, but the content is rich, with much to see, and is a valuable book. As for the great works of the Chinese, that's anyone's guess.</p>
<p>(3)</p>
<p>One day, school recruitment ads will have phrases like this: "...Our school's male dormitories are only separated from the female dormitories by a thin partition..." "Our school is conveniently located, with easy transportation, with the ×× Company in front, the ×× Dance Hall behind, the ×× Hospital to the left, and the ×× Grand Theater to the right."</p>
<p>(4)</p>
<p>Spending a dollar to buy a Christmas card for a lover seems like an unavoidable duty. But when you ask him to generously donate some money to refugees and the Northeastern Volunteers, he pulls out a handful of pawn tickets [pleading poverty].</p>
<p>(5)</p>
<p>I think someone will definitely compile a "Save-the-Nation Dictionary" in the future, using things like dancing to save the nation, movies to save the nation, entertainment to save the nation, mahjong to save the nation, prostitutes to save the nation... as materials.</p>
<p>(6)</p>
<p>Someone breaks down the words "important person" into "Western woman." So he uses a three-part argument to analyze it. I don't know if it's right, so I'll just write down these two theories for now. Major premise: "Important person" equals "Western woman," that is, a foreign woman.</p>
<p>Minor premise: "Foreign women" only care about money. Conclusion: Therefore, important people are also believers in the "only money" historical view.</p>
<p>Shop Assistant Correspondence</p>
<h3>Finding a Way Out! Different for Different People</h3>
<p>— Editor</p>
<p>In the past few days, we have received letters from Mr. Tu Yaochang, Mr. Wang Yuping, and Mr. Hu Shijing, all expressing dissatisfaction with their current jobs and wanting to "find a way out" to solve their livelihood problems. After careful study, we believe that the answer to the same question of "finding a way out" must vary from person to person. (1) Mr. Tu is a worker in an old-fashioned factory who has been a full apprentice for three years. During his apprenticeship, he suffered many hardships. Now his wages are meager. Thinking of the future heavy responsibilities of his family, he cannot bear them. He is filled with resentment, sadness, and fear, and he is thinking of "finding another way out." The editor believes that the pain of the apprenticeship is already over. Mr. Tu does not need to resent his memories. He should not say things like "a beast of burden" or "a living hell." He should therefore attach more and more importance to the skills he has acquired. He should not change his path, causing years of hard work to be wasted. As for future problems, he should not worry too much. He only needs to seize the moment of the "present" and strive for the progress of his own skills. Then "every trade produces its master." When that time comes, the problems will naturally be solved easily.</p>
<p>(2) Mr. Wang is a shop assistant in a cigarette shop. Because the store is very small and there is little hope, he is thinking of "finding another way out." We sympathize with Mr. Wang's desire to find another job because the store where he works is too small. However, the scope of finding another job should be carefully considered! Whether he is capable of doing it. Before he is sure, he must keep it a secret to avoid being caught in a dilemma.</p>
<p>(3) Mr. Hu is an apprentice in a small tea shop. According to Mr. Hu, the daily business of this shop is only six or seven yuan. In addition to the "market account," there are no other books. Besides the shop owner (who has another job) and Mr. Hu, there are no other shop assistants. Therefore, Mr. Hu can not only not gain insight into the mysteries of the tea industry, but he cannot even learn the basics of commerce. And in this kind of environment, there is no hope of getting ahead. "How long is life! There is no room for delay." We believe that Mr. Hu must not only diligently study academic subjects in his spare time, but he must also urgently seek another job! As for the method of proceeding, he can first entrust many relatives and friends, and pay attention to various opportunities. However, he must also strictly maintain secrecy, just like Mr. Wang.</p>
<h3>Alas, Resist Shanghai Rice</h3>

<h3>Sympathizer (Continued from Sixteen)</h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Meng Guobao was truly Wang Laoer's confidant, and Wang Laoer could be considered to know Meng Guobao as well. Sure enough, it was as he said. That evening, Meng Guobao came to the threshing ground again to chat with Wang Laoer. Wang Laoer asked him when he would go to the province, but he hesitated for a while. He replied: "That's not certain. Maybe I'll stay for ten and a half days, maybe I'll leave in three or five days." Wang Laoer's wife interjected from the side: "It's rare for Mr. San to come back. Why not play for a few more days?" Meng Guobao said: "I was originally going to leave in the next two or three days, but because I have something on my mind, I plan to talk about it in a few days." Wang Laoer laughed: "Mr. Meng San has something on his mind? What is it?" Meng Guobao said: "How would you rice planters know about our concerns?" Wang Laoer laughed and chuckled: "That's right, you scholars. Your concerns are only in books. How would we farmers know?" As he said this, Wang Laoer's wife sat on the side, not saying a word. Only the sound of the plantain leaf fan slapping mosquitoes on her body. After a long time, Meng Guobao smiled and said: "Actually, the things on my mind in books, I won't talk to you about that, you wouldn't understand it even more. You like to hear me talk about the prosperity of the city. I also like you to talk about the experiences of farmers, so we get along well." Wang Laoer said: "She was originally going to go back to her parents' house, but because she was eager to listen to Mr. San's stories, she didn't go." Meng Guobao paused for a moment before saying: "So that's how it is, then I'll always come and talk before I leave." Wang Laoer said: "City people always hate country people. It's rare to find someone like Mr. Meng San." Meng Guobao deliberately raised his voice and said: "Are all the people in the city good and all the people in the countryside bad? Country people are all genuine. If they become good, they will be ten times better than city people. For example, the most beautiful Xi Shi in ancient times. She was a country person." Wang Laoer laughed: "I'm not talking about women." Meng Guobao said: "I'm just using women as an analogy. It's like a pot of fresh flowers, planted in a vegetable garden in the countryside, watered with a dung ladle, who would look up to it? If it were moved to the city one day, planted in a porcelain pot, and put on a flower stand, wouldn't it be a treasure? Alas! The countryside? The countryside wastes so many things. Laoer, you are a smart person. You must understand what I'm saying." Wang Laoer laughed: "Oh, brother!</p>
<p>I'm a smart person? How did I become smart?" Wang Laoer's wife, who had been lonely for a long time, laughed with a sigh at this moment. Hearing this kind of laughter, Meng Guobao's heart was like a radio receiver, receiving a response, rippling slightly. Everyone talked until the Big Dipper was above the treetops before they dispersed. The next morning, Wang Laoer went to work. Meng Guobao came to his house to talk to him. Although he didn't find him, he talked to Wang Laoer's wife until the sun was about to set before he left. The next day, it was the same.</p>

<h3>Overview of the 1933 Standard New Car</h3>
<p>Exquisitely Manufactured and Well-Equipped</p>
<p>Smooth Ride and Comfortable Seating</p>
<p>...New Cars Now Arrived in Shanghai...</p>
<p>The 1933 Standard new car has now arrived in Shanghai. Its exquisite construction, complete equipment, and beautiful decoration have amazed and admired all who have seen it. It is unanimously recognized as a new car that is most satisfying. The most prominent feature of the new car is that its construction always considers the driver. Therefore, if viewed from the perspective of the driver, it is even more pleasantly surprising. People can't help but want to be in the driver's seat and try it out.</p>
<p>The image is a new product from the Standard family, a large four-seater car equipped with a 13.5-horsepower six-cylinder engine. This car is similar in shape to the 1933 Standard 9-horsepower car, but its power and effectiveness are far beyond it.</p>
<p>The body dimensions of the Standard new car are roughly similar to those of last year, namely the small nine, large nine, and sixteen. As for the two newly added types, namely the small twelve and large twelve, the body dimensions are exactly the same as the small nine and large nine. However, the first impression that the new car gives is that it is wider. Regarding this point, if we only talk about its body dimensions, the reason why it is wider is difficult to explain in a few words. But in my opinion, the new configuration of its dashboard is probably the main reason for the wider space. The dashboard style is shallower and flatter, and a large tray is placed on the lower right side of the partition for storing sundries. The driver can easily reach it, making it more convenient to take and place items. As for the seats of the new car, because they are equipped with extremely convenient operating standard parts, their position is lower. The gear lever and steering column are in the right position, and the effect is therefore greater. The single-panel screen is equipped with a simple opening device for easy use and adjustment. The screen installed in the Standard 20-style car is even easier to open. It only needs to turn a knob. The screen brushes on all Standard cars are all gas-operated and can also use double brushes. All of these are unique to the Standard 20 special car.</p>
<p>Considering the newly added models of the original models, the small nine is the one with special progress. There are three major features: the electric light group, the fuel gauge, and the four-speed gearbox. The electrical equipment was originally six volts, but now it has been changed to twelve volts. As for the electric fuel gauge, it is installed on the partition. Because of these improvements, the small nine is excellent, perfect, and fully equipped, comparable to any product. Opinions on electric light groups vary from person to person and are not consistent. However, in my opinion, even if we ignore the various advances in its overall aspects, such as the more sturdy chassis and automatic engine, just the change from six volts to twelve volts is worth the extra four pounds and ten shillings.</p>
<p>All Standard models are now equipped with electric fuel gauges, including the small nine model. The installation of a four-speed gearbox with silent gears makes the small nine more convenient and easy to operate. A common advantage of the new car models and the most gratifying to drivers is its improved elasticity. This is the natural result of using longer springs and small pressure shock absorbers.</p>
<p>There is absolutely no need to worry about shaking in the Standard new car. Its front engine bracket is now cushioned with a combination of rubber and springs. As for the two twelve-horsepower and two nine-horsepower models, the managing pedals are installed on the shaft and are attached to the chassis instead of being an entire organization with the engine. Therefore, drivers can feel more comfortable with its protection. Furthermore, because the [Sures] automatic engine is a standard equipment on all Standard cars, even beginners can rely on it without fear of damaging the cylinder walls due to excessive restraint. In short, the Standard new car not only maintains its original advantages, but also promotes and enhances them, making it exquisite, beautiful, and outstanding.</p>
<h3>Worldwide Automobile Statistics (Dull)</h3>
<p>There are 35 million cars in the world</p>
<p>Recently, the automobile industry has been developing rapidly, and the number of cars driving on the streets is also increasing day by day. Therefore, how many cars are there in various countries in the world today? It would be an interesting question to add up the statistics. Therefore, the global automobile statistics compiled by the United Kingdom are recorded to fill this publication.</p>
<p>According to news from London, the British automobile magazine has published details on the recent situation of the automobile and railway industries. In terms of the current situation, although the transportation industry in the United Kingdom has shown signs of stagnation in some places, the automobile industry is still developing rapidly. As a result, the railway industry has been greatly affected. Therefore, the British authorities are now calling for efforts to save the railway industry from its decline.</p>
<p>It is well known that there is an urgent need to improve transportation recently. The only way to improve is to manage it properly and drive carefully. Although the economic situation in the United Kingdom has fallen into a recession, the automobile industry is still making progress. Taking 1931 as an example, as of the end of September, the total number of cars produced in the United Kingdom was 95,000. As for this year, in the general expectation of the automobile industry, although various industries have been greatly depressed due to economic impact, the number of cars sold domestically will not exceed a reduction of more than 4% compared with the previous year.</p>
<p>Furthermore, how many cars are there in various countries in the world today? The following table is based on each continent, and readers can easily see the general situation.</p>
<p>Continent Name Quantity</p>
<p>Europe 5,680,656</p>
<p>Americas 28,144,906</p>
<p>Asia 577,743</p>
<p>Oceania 749,222</p>
<p>Africa 363,915</p>
<p>Total 35,516,915</p>
<p>According to the table above, we can know that the Americas have the most cars today. Because the United States is an advanced country in the automobile industry, the automobile industry must be more developed than other countries. The second is Europe. As for Asia, although it is vast and rich in resources, the number of cars is not as large as Oceania. Africa has even fewer than Asia, because it is sparsely populated and most of its inhabitants are uncivilized natives. There are more than 35 million cars in the world. As for the fuel consumed by automobiles, in the United Kingdom, it was 1,025,466,000 gallons in 1931, and 995,000,000 gallons in 1930.</p>
<h3>Automobile Anecdotes (Moya)</h3>
<p>Chicago Car Thieves</p>
<p>The number of car thieves in Chicago, USA, has increased in recent years. The police authorities pay close attention to these car-stealing gentlemen. Once a case occurs, detectives are dispatched everywhere. [Striving to solve the case] can be described as the situation, which can also be seen in the degree of activity of this group. Chicago suffers a loss of 10,000,000 yuan per year due to car thefts, which is shocking. According to estimates by the police station and insurance companies, more than 35,000 cars are stolen in Chicago every year. Although 30,000 of them are recovered afterwards, nine out of ten will suffer losses. For example, the movement of parts, the lack of tires, spark plugs, and dashboards, etc. As for the 5,000 cars that are not returned, the loss is estimated at 500 yuan per car, which is worth about 2,500,000 yuan, which cannot be said to be insignificant. Added to the value of the parts of insured or uninsured vehicles, the total number should be 10,000,000 yuan. Young people account for the majority of car thieves. According to police records, two-thirds of the perpetrators are under the age of twenty-one.</p>
<h3>Canadian Automobile Production</h3>
<p>Canada's automobile production has increased considerably last year. The production in the first seven months of 1932 increased compared to the same period in previous years. The production in July was 7,772 cars, an increase of 5% compared to 7,132 cars in June. Compared with July 1931, the car production at that time was only 4,220 cars, an increase of 77%. Automobile exports in July jumped from 1,233 cars to 2,699 cars. The number of cars manufactured for local use in Canada decreased from 579 cars in June to 4,773 cars. The number of cars imported to Canada in July was 114 cars, and the number of cars exported was 1,540 cars. In the first seven months of 1932, about 42,939 cars were sold in Canada. In the same period in 1931, it was 68,350 cars.</p>
<h3>Analysis of Chevrolet Car Materials</h3>
<p>The structure of a car and the raw materials used are very extensive. Steel, wood, cotton cloth, rubber, glass, etc. are widely used. Therefore, everything from steel and silver to asphalt and oxygen is regarded as a necessary material. Now, let's analyze it with a Chevrolet car. There are as many as 30 kinds of main materials used to make this car. For example, a standard five-seater car, excluding gas, oil, and water, weighs about 2,665 pounds. Steel accounts for the largest weight. Extensible and cast iron weigh 492 pounds. Steel, from block steel to steel wire, weighs 1,606 pounds. All these raw materials and their by-products are sourced from various provinces in the United States. The economic and human resources spent are really not small. In addition to steel, each car also has 198 pounds of soft and hard wood. This wood is specially used to manufacture Fisher bodies. Most of the body is made of wood and steel, so it is durable. In addition, the car uses 83 pounds of rubber for tires and insulation in the engine. Most of these materials are not produced in the Americas. The windshields, glass windows, and lamps used to manufacture Chevrolet cars require 54 pounds of glass. 53 pounds of cotton are needed to make the cushions. 26 pounds of copper and 17 pounds of refined copper are used. Lead mines in the western United States also use 20 pounds of their products for car manufacturing. There are also white wax, etc. Each car also uses 5.01 pounds of tin during manufacturing. Several pounds of nickel, mica, cellulose, and silver are used in body manufacturing. 18 pounds of paper are used for cushioning the engine and roof during car manufacturing. A lot of pigments and substitutes are also used, weighing about 17 pounds. In addition, 2 pounds of oxygen and 9 pounds of paint are also necessary supplies.</p>

<h3>Twenty-Seven Years of Waiting Time</h3>
<p>The time spent waiting by car drivers in the United States on the road every day is very considerable. According to estimates by the American Automobile Association, if all American car drivers spend an average of nine minutes a day waiting to pass on the road, then the total time spent waiting in one day will reach 27 years. Therefore, car drivers are often impatient on the road, waiting for the green light to turn on. From this, we can know that they cherish their time. Now, let's describe how 27 years of time are accumulated as follows. In large cities, there must be traffic lights at road intersections. According to strict statistics, each car driver spends an average of 5 to 9 minutes waiting to pass on the road every day. There are approximately 15,000,000 car drivers in each city. On average, 5 people use one car, so the number of people using cars is approximately 3,000,000. Then, even if each person waits 5 minutes per day, it will still be around 27 years. In addition, the amount of gasoline consumed due to waiting for vehicles, if calculated by year, is also considerable in quantity and value.</p>
<h3>New Plans for the British Automobile Manufacturing Industry by Gan</h3>
<p>Pay Attention to Overseas Sales Policies</p>
<p>Reduce Costs and Mass Produce</p>
<p>Recently, British automobile manufacturers have had much to say about past overseas sales policies, paying particular attention to the inability to examine local needs to adapt to market sales in foreign countries and various parts of the empire. Furthermore, the lack of adequate service facilities after cars are sold is also one of the shortcomings of past automobile sales. Finally, it is said that the initial cost of cars made in Britain is particularly excessive, especially the prices in the domestic market. These criticisms are undeniable in many cases, and many other manufacturing industries suffer from this problem as well, in addition to the automobile manufacturing industry. However, it is also particularly easy to get rid of these difficulties. Because the needs of the domestic market and foreign car users are often diametrically opposed, the only way to gain a foothold in the overseas market in the past was to build a special "colonial" model to meet the needs.</p>
<p>According to export operators, the situation of the British automobile manufacturing industry has recently changed, both domestically and internationally, and this trend is common. Because of this, the position of the British automobile manufacturing industry has reached an optimistic path again. Due to the economic decline in the United Kingdom, small-scale automobile manufacturers have no hope of development, so a few larger-scale manufacturers have risen to replace them. Gradually, the domestic automobile market is dominated by several manufacturers. Also, due to economic constraints, a small number of wealthy classes in society have recently abandoned luxurious cars and replaced them with mass-produced cars to meet the needs of transportation. As for how many of these situations there are, it is impossible to calculate at once. In short, the domestic automobile market in the United Kingdom has recently been developing day by day, even if the income of individuals in society is decreasing. With the above-mentioned reasons, the current situation of the British automobile manufacturing industry is that the number of car models has been reduced and production has greatly increased, unlike the past when production was small and there were many styles. Therefore, judging from the current situation, half of the British-made private cars are handled by two automobile manufacturers. This is not just idle talk.</p>
<p>Today, the cost of manufacturing automobiles in the United Kingdom has been reduced, and this cannot be denied. The benefits of the price reduction have been enjoyed by buyers at home and abroad. The impact of overseas economic decline has also been helpful to the British automobile manufacturing industry, as it has led to attention being paid to the reduction of recurring expenses during manufacturing. The economy of use is a noble advantage of British-made cars, enough to compete with other competitors. In addition, what can be celebrated for the British automobile manufacturing industry is that the roads in foreign countries have recently been improved day by day, almost like those in England. Therefore, all ordinary cars that are sold exclusively in the domestic market can be used smoothly overseas without hindrance.</p>
<p>As a result of the above-mentioned advantages, the export of British automobile manufacturing in foreign trade is much more limited than in the most developed year of 1929. This is compared with Britain's strong competitors, the United States and Canada. The combined export decline of the United States and Canada in 1930 and 1931 accounted for about 68%, while the export decline of Britain accounted for only 40%. What is particularly important is the vehicle statistics imported into Australia. This statistic was recently compiled by the Overseas Trade Department. It states that a total of 440 pieces of unmounted car chassis were imported from the British Empire, worth £38,886. 72 pieces were imported from the United States, worth £6,047. The number of fully assembled cars and bodies imported from the United Kingdom is also higher. All motorcycles are manufactured in the United Kingdom, totaling 109 pieces. The trend of importing cars from the United Kingdom to New Zealand is also the same. The number of cars imported into New Zealand in the first six months of this year was the lowest in eleven years, but the superiority of British-made cars remains unshakable. Of the total number of 1,883 cars worth £267,143, 1,415 cars worth £247,575 were imported from the United Kingdom. Therefore, judging from all aspects, if the world's industries recover to their original state, it can be asserted that the British manufacturing industry will be able to obtain a superior position in the world market. It is also expected that its export volume will exceed the mediocre number of 42,021 in 1929.</p>
