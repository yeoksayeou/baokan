<p>和平前途已有轉機當局否認對日妥協</p>
<p>（北平）二十三日下午、美敎師得通州電話、該方面曰軍確未前進、平津居民雖連日來感受極度恐懼、但此時已稍見安定、記者由各方面所得之消息、綜合而觀察之、似和平前途、已有轉機、但决不如樂觀者所傳、和平方式我與日方已有若何諒解、蓋問題在我方旣不願屈服、而日亦不容易就範也、（二十三日中央社電）</p>
<p>（北平）此間政治空氣之寒暑表倐起倐落、令人無從捉摸、昨夜頗呈悲觀、今晨忽漸轉樂觀、至今日午後、中日負責方面皆承認大局已較有希望、某高級華員否認天津所傳今晨休戰協定簽字説、謂並未有所簽定、（二十三日路透社電）</p>

<p>平順義高力營通州香河寳坻林亭寗河爲止、華軍退人該陣以内、然後由中日代表談判關於長城内區域之詳則、如能成功、則日華將退至長城、苟非日後談判决裂、不致續有戰事、（二十三日路透社電）</p>
<p>汪謂不作城下之盟</p>
<p>（南京）汪精衛語某社記者、謂日軍企圖攻取平津、積極進逼、　國無論如何、祗有抵抗一途、有一分力量、抵抗一分决不作城下之盟、外傳妥協全係虚機、平津形勢緊急在平軍政要人何應欽·黄郛等均有電到京請示、（二十三日專電）</p>
<p>英法兩使出任斡旋</p>
<p>（北平）時局緊張、已達最後關頭、聞英法兩使二十二深夜擬出任斡旋、（二十三日專電）</p>

<p>央軍退黄河南、（二）長城内八十里、中國不得駐兵、（三）明令取消抗日組織、（四）華軍事當局向日道歉、我方對其無理要求、决難接受、日仍謂我無誠意和平、通告决裂（二十二日專電）</p>

<p>和議進行不甚順利</p>
<p>（北平）據華方消息、日方頃以非正式之通告致華方、要求於三日内接受日方所提出之要求、否則戰事將縱之而起云、華方與日方之條件、雖相距過遠、昨晚黄郛何應欽又舉行軍事會議、空氣極爲悲觀、今日黄郛否認和議業已决裂之説、並謂『正式之磋商、迄未進行』云、而華文報紙亦謂和平尙未絶望云、各報又載稱、昨夜軍事會議之結果、以日人無誠意、認爲和平無望因若日人果有和平誠意、則當華軍停止抵抗及撤退時、日軍即應停止戰事、不應再行前進、（廿三日路透社電）　　各將領願對敵一拼</p>

<p>防禦工作仍在進行</p>
<p>（北平）東京所傳日軍現距北平僅三基羅米達之説、實屬無稽、日軍之哨兵最近者在通州以東數哩、但據可恃方面之消息、和議之進行、並不順利、平津方面不久將發生紛擾、據稱因日軍距離北平不遠之故、日方所提出之要求、皆非此方軍事領袖等所能承認者、北平城外防禦之工作、仍在進行中、倘使和議不成、或將再度發生激戰、北平城内現時皆兵、均有背城一戰之决心、日方之態度、自昨晨起、亦趨强硬、衆料四十八小時之内恐有嚴重之發展、（二十三日路透社電）</p>

<h3 id="c20">平津局勢之轉變梓 <a href="#c20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>平津局勢急變。昨晨之緊張空氣似又爲續來之和平消息所掃除此不特</p>
<p>使黄郛所進行之諒解運動得一基礎。而實爲九一八事變發生以來十一閲月間之形勢。轉成以後吾人所不易知之局面之一重要關鍵也。</p>
<p>據十七日黄郛初抵平時所發表之談話彼將首先謀一雙方所共諒解之</p>
<p>和平辦法但對日决不妥協或求和吾人依此後一週間所經過之事實而觀察日軍於我軍奉令撤退時追踪進撃向距平津不足百里之地作三面包圍之姿勢。其欲脅我爲城下之盟可不待言更加以昨晨之緊張空氣日方之不肯中止其侵略行爲。益顯然可見蓋軍事學之解釋戰爭爲『以武力作用使對方屈服於我之意志。而便續行政略之行爲」日軍自藩陽突擊以來以武力佔我土地侵我主權。造成東北僞組織。均可以此解釋。之日軍最近之行動。亦即可以此解釋。之今黄氏諒解之進行。能使日方對其用兵目的。作相當之改變。而保持不妥協不求和之聲明乎。此爲今日國人所最注意者也。</p>
<p>英使藍浦遜斡旋下之雙方會談。其性質爲如何此亦極關重要者贊成諒</p>
<p>解運動者所表示之希望。則爲進行不涉政治問題之交涉。吾國近五年之歷史中。有兩次對敵媾和之成績。一爲十八年十二月對俄戰事後之伯力媾和談判。一爲去年五月間之上海停戰撤兵談判。前者俄方有急求解决之意旨。後者爲發動於國際關係之事件。故表面上尙少損害國權之處今黄氏之對手非常年蔡運升之對手可比而黄氏處境。尤較去年郭泰祺所處者惡劣百倍。差以毫釐謬以千里。九一八事變以來。全國軍民之犧牲奮鬥。是否得保持其相當之效用與此將成諒解基礎之會談有至密切之關係此亦今日國人所不能忽視者。</p>
<p>此所謂諒解運動自政府確定『一面抵抗一面交涉』之對日方針以來。有</p>
<p>長時期之醖釀。輿論界在事前對於陳述利害判斷是非。表示民意亦已相當盡其本分。而事勢所趨。卒不免於出此。一途吾人對此。以爲激切陳説。已非其時。討論功罪。亦屬無益今日之最要者。爲集中。全國之力。與敵周旋勿使因此所造成之局面。爲將來收復國土之障碍。</p>
<p>去秋以來。我外交當局關於中日事件。嘗向世界發表下列之政策。『一中國絶對不因武力之壓迫而放棄尺寸土地與一部主權二絶對不能同意於以日方武力創造維持與支配之東省僞組織爲前提之解决辦法三合理辦法。必以不背國聯規約非戰公約九國公約之文字與精神與夫中國之主權同時又確能鞏固遠東永久之和平者。爲必要之條件。』吾人以爲諒解運動。即使有進行之必要。亦應不背於此三條件以保持我國家對外之信用。</p>

<p>五强會議决定進行辦法</p>
<p>（日内瓦）當今日開會時、美代表在良好</p>
<p>空氣中首先發言、（其演詞見昨夜譯稿）、英外相繼起致詞、表示英政府對於台維斯贊助軍縮之感忱、並謂意政府始終維持、亦爲渠所感謝、英國計畫非無缺點、但美總統之宣言、與德政府意見之宣佈、已使前途氣象完全改變、德代表那杜尼所發德國可撤銷其軍備等語、使渠確信現可着手於詳細之討論條文今可逐一付諸考慮云、法外長彭古對於英國提議之詳則、採取不受拘束之態度、蓋法政府僅在原則上接受英國提議也、彭古聲稱今已至討論軍縮難題中政治上與技術上各點之時期、故渠建議先行討論英國草約第一節、尤其是地方協定之問題云、主席允之、但美代表台維斯則反對此項建議、（二十二日路透電</p>

<p>畢時、有驚人發展、頗足摧毁前此演詞所引起之和諧印象、主席漢德森允以英國所提草約之第一節爲開始討論之事件後、美代表台維斯請重行考慮此種手續、謂在渠已説明美國態度後、似未有虚擲光隂討論第一節之需要、蓋安全問題由直接有關之各國自行討論、較爲適宜也、美代表此種態度、不爲法方所贊同、法國以爲美代表如此主張、是强欲法國滿意於美國所發參加協商之空泛不定的諾言也、主席鑒此倐然發生之變局、遂宣佈總委員會休會至明日午後（二十二日路透電）　　（日内瓦）閉會後即經彭古與台維斯私人</p>
<p>商定、明日在軍縮總委員會中先開始討論安全公約、惟同時由私人談話、進行裁減戰具問題、（二十二日國民電）</p>

<p>至十二點時在軍縮會議主席漢特森寓所會商、俾决定今日午後總委員會當討論安全問題、抑或討論軍器問題、五國代表會晤時辯論頗爲劇烈、法國外長彭古辯護法國立塲、以爲法國所可承諾之軍備</p>
<p>縮減、有頼於各國相互之安全保障、及軍備之國際監察、因此以從安全問題討論入手方合理論、但代表中大多數則要求先行解决軍縮問題、嗣經通過决議案、宣言總委員會應將軍縮安全兩問題、同時提出討論、且在英國計劃舉行初讀會、俾全部問題得以考慮之前、槪不舉行何項表决、（二十三日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>會議後、鄧即自動讓防三十餘縣、以爲友軍駐</p>
<p>紮、去歲二十一四兩軍交惡、彼守中立、待二十四軍劉文輝重返省垣、卽發生種種誤會、並傳言劉要解决二十八軍、鄧初不以爲然、厥後二十四軍方面負責人有露骨之表示、鄧始愴惶出省、藉召集部隊協助田頌堯勦匪爲名、　實則積極作軍事上之準備、於新都地方　召集全軍將領會議、决定三項作戰步驟、（一）將全軍各部隊完全集中於新都·金堂·廣漢·三縣、待與各方聯絡完成、再行决定反攻計劃、（二）將成都部隊完全調移、所有省垣機關、一律犧牲、讓與二十四軍、免雙方於省城衝突、發生巷戰、再苦民民、敎爲各方責　、（三）聯絡二十九軍共同生存、共同滅亡、並聯二十一軍劉湘·及新六師李家鈺·二十三師羅澤洲·一致向二十四軍進攻、根本解决、進取不得、全部退入松藩·會理·茂州·徐圖再舉、上項辦法决定後、二十八軍各軍卽堅决作戰之心、與二十四軍作殊死戰、故歷年在川被各軍視爲懦弱之二十八軍今竟、變以往態度、並迭敗二十四軍之驍勇部隊李玉書石肇武等部、</p>

<p>陳素芬一片痴情竟以身殉</p>
<p>鄧瑞人虚與委蛇釀此慘變</p>
<p>新新社云、粤女陳素芬於四月十六日清</p>
<p>晨、在靜安寺路華安大厦四樓第四百十二號房内服毒自殺一案、頗引起各界注意、當記者着手調查時、即在新閘捕房内得閲該女日記、並曾抄録片段、批露四月十七日各報、諒早爲請者所鑒及、當時致電話與白克路寳隆醫院之幕中人、翌日經法院檢騐後、代爲收殮之余志博、及此中真相、當時以時間怱促、語焉不詳、嗣經記者從各方面剌探、再從該女日記中所記各節、按圖索驥、恍然大白、爰再録而出之、想亦爲讀者所歡迎、當不以明日黄花視之也、</p>

<p>粤中名妓、素芬之名、係最近所改稱、樂籍中名</p>
<p>冷紅、容貌眛麗、舉止端詳、幼年曾入學、後以家貧、於十五歲時卽被鬵爲妓、母早故、家中僅一老父、現年六十歳、陳性　自負、不願與汚流同伍、故當時雖走馬章台、不乏王孫公子、終以難委終身、未加青睞、因又自名『涙涯』、以明其志但冀擇人而事、脱離苦海、陳固未嘗一日或忘也、會當年有</p>

<p>國華銀行董事長、滄洲飯店主人、一二八滬變之</p>

<h3 id="c150">鄧陳之結晶品　奈鄧家中已有糟糠 <a href="#c150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>、且具季常癖、因此對陳雖具雙飛之誓、終難如</p>
<p>願、鄧乃斥資若干與陳、希冀了此一重公案、但陳矢守初志、非鄧不嫁願守終身、因此雙方久久不决、此民國十二年間之事也、及民國十三年素芬方十八歲、在粤生一女、卽現題名爲『湘玲』者、此孩之生、可謂古井重波、使將死之灰、重起火燄、陳亦因此向鄧重提舊誓、斯時之鄧、真所調進退兩難、順之則勢又不能、棄之未免負義、乃不得不虚與委蛇、暫築金屋、但陳痴心一片、終以未舉正式婚禮爲不足、乃不時催促之、</p>

<p>陳素芬方得安身之所、正待佳音時、忽見鄧踪跡</p>
<p>漸疏、且資斧更虞不給、乃百計冀求會面、終無效果、卽偶通魚雁、亦竟如石沉大海、最近鄧負某項使命來滬、居住别墅中、詎竟被陳得悉、乃由粤乘輪追踪來滬、千方百計、始得與陳晤面、雙方談判之間、幾乎各走極端、後鄧恐妨及使命、乃諉囑陳赴杭求學幾年、再談嫁娶、並允盡力資助一切、陳於無可奈何中、乃整裝赴杭、並約鄧一二日後、繼往探視、</p>

<p>青年會内、鄧以環境壓迫、乃不得不赴杭一行、</p>
<p>當時素芬意爲鄧之此來、對已一片熱情、當有一番憐愛、詎又事與願違、蓋鄧雖約陳舟中相叙、後以耳目衆多、萬一傳出、恐於已之聲譽有關、乃竟爽約、陳怨恨之下、向鄧重重責難、更恐從此遺棄、同時杭青年會已有耳聞、乃堅决隨鄧離杭來滬、逼其履行前言、鄧一味推諉、後經鄧友斡旋、乃諉陳準一個月後履約、並爲陳在華安大厦租定四百十二號房間、使伊居住、並囑伊安心守候、此即陳素芬寓居華安大厦之由來也、</p>

<p>後、不時抽暇前往叙會、陳自殺之前一夜（即十五日）下午十一時許、鄧尙密赴華安、以陳適外出卽走、十二時詐又往、陳已歸寢、兩人繾綣備至、嗣兩人於談笑間、又談及嫁娶事、鄧言對間、不免稍露搪塞形跡、陳卽言將以自殺向鄧明志、表示無負於人、鄧尙一味敷衍、詎陳竟卽奔入浴室、攫取洗澡所用之來沙爾一瓶、拔去木塞、向口内直灌、鄧施救不及、又恐禍事發覺後、於已不利、急披衣奔出、至附近借打電話、延醫求救、一面奔赴友人處、挽其出面料理、此卽寳隆醫院之怪電話、及余志博代爲棺殮之由來也、</p>

<h3 id="c155">日記影事重重　日記中最緊要者、 <a href="#c155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>厥爲三月二十六日、同時日記亦以此日爲止、蓋</p>
<p>此時素芬方由粤到滬、正探得鄧之行踪、而晤面後無結果之時也、故三月二十六日所記中、多怨恨之詞、因此言行間、不及檢及字句、真情畢露、兹爲讀者探索計、不以累贅、抄錄於下、『那麽我從此打電話找他、他又不聽、寫信把他、他又不看、只有扯碎投入字紙簏吧、但是他這様的態度對我　我亦並不怨恨他、他越恨我、那我的罪越减輕一些、但求對於他夫妻俩人的感情没有發生影響、我無論怎様的痛苦、我亦甘願受了、』我這次急於離開青年會的原因、亦是爲着保存他的名譽起見、同時又因爲龍先生担保我在此地住』、『同時青年會内的辦事人、知道上海打兩三次電話來找我、和常時他們說道、有一個親戚在上海住、他查起來、定知道是瑞姊和我兩人的關係、那時豈不是對於他的地位、發生影響同時他夫妻、必因爲我而弄出悲劇』、「我平日的愛尤其是和瑞這一次的經過、種種事情、我始終没有對任何一個人宣布過　常時只有壓抑在心</p>

<p>丨吳縣吳以田君來信丨</p>
<p>我是吳縣北鄉人。爸爸早亡，媽媽尙在。家</p>
<p>中赤貧。平日生活，僅賴媽媽的家庭工作所入。小時候讀過三年舊式書。在十二歲的時候，我的媽媽將我送到一個小鎭上去學習苧蔴和南貨店的生意，不到一年，因爲不堪店東與師母的虐待，逃回家中。道個年頭，我的　媽媽擇定了鄰近一個目不議丁非常愚蠢的薛姓之女包辦式的將我訂了婚。當時因爲我的智識程度與傳統的羞恥念的束縳，毫無反抗的默認了。後來有一個勤學的同鄉，時常借給各種書籍我看，并且隔了一年，代我到鄉村師範裏去報了一個名，一方面鼓勵着我的勇氣呌我去投考。這一回僥倖被我考取了，於是開始我的學校生活。是年冬，我的媽媽又要强迫我要和薛女結婚，我曾再三拒絶。不料我的媽媽竟斷絶我的經濟關係，那時候我立刻有輟學的危險了。因爲顧全到這一層，不得已祇得聽從母命而舉行過一次結婚的形式。但是在那十年中，我從來未有和他發生過肉體上的任何關係，可指天日。乃自畢業後，由敎員而校長由校長而又得到一個最下層的自治工作人員的小小領袖地位。在去年冬，共同明白根本不能合作的痛苦，爲什麽葬送二人前途的幸福呢？彼此覺悟着，乃各人提出離婚的條件，徴得兩方同意，由律師證明，法院備案，經過了合法手續，兩方自願解徐夫妻關係，這倒没有什麽困難問題。但是一般封建殘餘者流，對我加以無情的攻撃，認爲糟糠之妻，不應解除，此一舉動，罪大惡極，人格堕落。編者先生啊！請你説一句公道話吧？你認爲我的行爲怎様呢！婚姻問題是不是可以遷就的呢？還是主張鄭重的呢？這是一想不到『波未平，一波又起』了！我自從離婚以後，因爲自治工作緊張的緑故。很少機會和同等思想與同等智識的青年女人接近，乃由同學都某介紹一個舊式家庭的養姓之女，當時説得怎様的粗通文字，品性優良，治理家政，有條不紊的種種好處。那我信以爲真了，認爲鄒乃我的老同學也，决不會來欺騙我。他又領我到姜女家裏去吃過一次飯，當時限於封建社會的壁壘！男女開會丨根本未有破壞之前，終覺不便和姜女談話。這一回，僅不過得到「内在不知，外表尙可』的把握，乃於是日憑媒交换了照片和雜物，并且付出押帖洋十元，預備定期送盤了，幾乎完成了舊式婚姻的初步工作。不到幾天，被我探聞着許多不愉快的情跡，什麽不貞節呌！不識字啦！家庭歷史的惡劣啦！那我馬上表示拒絶，停止進行。嗣後姜女之父，反而瘋狂似的向我直接交涉，要求賠償名譽與物質上的損失。近日來弄得我焦頭爛額，神昏顛倒。萬一達到涉訟的地位罷，那種發現的『事出有因，查無實據一的證據，萬萬提不出來，在法律上實没有把握，而且我的職位或者從此有動摇的危險。若爲了息事寗人計，和平解决罷！對方的苛刻條件，難以允命。此事已勢成僵局，進退兩難，實無法以善其後。懇求識見高超，深有經騐的纺者先生，趕快代我想一個妥善的辦法，指示我應走的路。并且以後怎様去找的愛人尼？在這過渡時期的階段裏，有没有滿意的希望呢？</p>
<p>答：來書誦悉，略復如左：（一）婚</p>
<p>姻問題不可以牽就；（二）你憑人家説</p>
<p>她好，你便向她交結，甚至於訂婚；憑人家説她不好，又對她發生問題：什麽『許多不愉快的情跡』咧，什麽。『不貞潔』咧，什麽『不識字』咧，什麽『家庭歷史的惡劣』咧，弄得你喪魂失魄，足見你是一個『以耳代目』毫無主張的人丨現在人在你跟前，你可同她往來，『耳聽是虚，眼見是實，究竟是不是『不識字』呢？是不是有許多不愉快的形跡呢？果真她從前失了身，但是她現在確其愛你，那又有什麽關係呢？家庭歷史怎様惡劣呢？當娼嗎？密淫嗎？果其如此，與她本人又有什麽直接的關係呢？即使她本人從前惡劣，然而她現在在行動上表現爲一個自愛向上的人，艱道便因爲她從前的事跡埋没她現在的好處嗎？老實説：『敗子回頭金不換』，假使我没有老婆，我一定要物色一個從前『惡劣』現在改悔；從前『不貞』現在一心要做好人的女子，而拒絶那自以爲亭亭玉立白璧無瑕的閨秀小姐。因爲後者未嘗人過世，未嘗在汚濁社會的滚過，就是説：未嘗到過試騐塲，將來是否失足，誰也不能保險。倒是前者，惡社會的苦頭已經嘗過了，所謂『人之情僞盡知之矣』，現在回過味來，『放下屠刀』，找一個歸宿。若與之相處，一定會體貼入微，給你不少的安慰。從前有一個學者，他的夫人死了，寫信給朋友説，他預備物色一個寡婦做續弦，有人問他的理由，他説，寡婦死過丈夫，一定曉得没了丈夫的苦痛，而今再嫁丈夫，她一定知道寳貴她的丈夫了。其言雖近谑，然實有至理存焉，用爲足下述之。總而言之：自已拿定主張，千萬不要『東倒吃羊肉，西倒吃狗肉』。</p>

<h3 id="c195">怪傑避壽 <a href="#c195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>— 瞻廬</p>
<p>轟動世界三大怪傑，在意，有　索里呢；在德有希</p>
<p>特勒；在日本，有荒木貞夫。</p>
<p>倘把三個人做起一篇合論來，荒木貞夫的怪傑分數，只怕不</p>
<p>能及格吧丨他只會欺侮弱國，傑在那裏？意相愚索里尼的怪傑地位，已保持了長久，現在還是方興未艾。最近在政治舞臺上漏臉，有不可一世的氣槪，氣走了『相對論』發明家愛因斯坦，嚇壞了許多盤剥重利的『歇洛克』式猶太富豪；甚至，他的言諭，引起了世界列强的注意，論調和平一些，列强似乎吃了定心丸，論調激烈一些，列强便皺起眉頭似乎大禍便要爆發。唉丨一個戰敗國的首相，竟使人這般重視，希特勒的怪傑，簡直是名不虚傳的怪傑丨</p>
<p>上月某日，是怪傑希特勒四十四歲壽誕。權相做壽，當然</p>
<p>是一種大發其財的好生意；但看，中國歷史上的權相，那一個不是大做其壽？一輩奴隷婢膝的屬僚下吏，借這機會，便可以輦金權門，在壽翁面前運動些好差好缺。只須做一回壽四面八方一起的『生辰綱，』正不知要收進多少金珠寳貝？甚至，相而不權，權而不相的二三等要人，每逢誕辰，也不肯放過這發財機會。任憑民衆在那裏笑駡，但，笑駡出他笑駡，壽翁我自爲之，這是中國官吏的一種傳統思想。</p>
<p>話説得太多了，抛開本文了，畢竟希特勒做壽不做壽呢？他的誕辰，德總統興登堡贈給他一幀親自署名銀架裝成的照片，似這般的非常榮龐，寳有大做其壽的必要；然而，他竟實行避壽了。然而，他雖避壽，民衆却一定要替他大做其壽了。這一天，全國報紙都特關着希特勒一攔，國社黨部接到四方絡繹不絶的賀電，黨員和鋼盔團都在柏林内務部前參加檢閲；各機關都懸旗慶祝，晚間又有盛大的提燈會；人民擁護到這般地步，這是怪傑值得自豪的。</p>
<p>靠着做壽發財的中國大好老冷笑道：希特勒，你雖得着民衆擁護，但，不肯自已做壽，便錯過了發財機會，你不是壽翁，你是個壽頭碼子了。</p>

<p>— 醉痴生</p>
<p>隔壁Ｘ小姐，中學是畢業了，寂寞家居。一天在報紙上看見『ＸＸ</p>
<p>公司招考女職員』的告白，就觸動了伊</p>
<p>的心弦，興匆匆跑到那公司去報名應考。到了考試的日期，Ｘ小姐换了件簇新時式的旗袍，帶了些應用的物件，去做考員的一分子。當時預考的，有半老徐娘，有摩登少女，妍的媸的，擠滿了一屋子。這當然都是懷着希望，爲着『謀女子經濟獨立』來的。大家總算做了一篇白話文，寫了一封書信，結束出塲。辦事人對伊們説；過了三日，來聽回音　　到了三日後的下午，Ｘ小姐又興匆匆</p>
<p>跑去聽消息。那公司裏的辦事人對伊説：本公司業已選取女職員數名，每月薪水十四元，都是『丰姿绰約，身材苗條，』的摩登小姐。像女士的程度，確實不差。不過身段肥胖了，所以不及格。這是本公司營業所關，不得不從嚴去取Ｘ小姐聽了這話，又羞又憤，扭轉身子就走。還隠隠聽得有人説：像這様的大塊頭，也要來想做『花瓶』，真是不識相。</p>
<p>Ｘ小姐氣極了，四下一望，好像天地</p>
<p>爲窄，自已的身體，又好似放大了幾倍，悄悄地回家。夜飯也没有喫，整整的哭了一夜。</p>
<h3 id="c197">功狗 <a href="#c197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>— 丙丁</p>
<p>狗没有國家，母須盡『當兵』納税</p>
<p>的義務，更論不着享受『亡國奴』</p>
<p>的權利，當然人及不來狗。况且，現在</p>
<p>有會做電影的狗：狗明星丨保護闊人</p>
<p>的狗：警犬丨帮助獵人的狗；丨獵狗丨以及爲國家出力的狗；丨功狗丨狗的豐功偉烈，畢竟可觀，當然人及不來狗丨　　對於國家有功的，當然要論功行賞</p>
<p>甚至爼豆馨香，廟祀千秋，也是義不容辭。曾滌生因爲湘軍之破南京，死了不少，便在南京建了湘軍昭忠祠。還做篇大文章，來讚美戰死湘軍的忠烈。一二八之役·十九路軍抵抗倭軍而死的不少，也有人發起建立無名英雄墓。只有論功及於動物，我們中國人，却不曾想到。做中國人固然不幸，做中國的狗馬，是更不幸的了。</p>
<p>據説；『日本軍部决定自六月一日起</p>
<p>，實施軍用動物的論功行賞。其種類分甲·乙丙三項·被賞的動物·爲軍馬，軍犬，及軍用鴿。這類動物爲國而死的，在芝公園增上寺設慰靈堂，會祀在這堂内』。我想；日本人待爲國而死的犬馬，猶且這様優渥，他們日本國的犬馬，當然要和日本人，一様的爲國家效命了。回轉來説，我們貴國，對於這類爲國而死的動物，没有建祠，没有設靈，忠魂飄蕩，祇得把天地來做棺槨，日月來做含燧，獸魂有知，也要嘆息比日本的犬馬不如了。</p>

<p>遠袁地在耳中聽到了嗚嗚汽笛的呌聲，那條長蛇似的火車，蜿蜒地</p>
<p>慢慢走入了月台：一陣喧閙的聲音，頓時響起，這時候，有的是單身的旅客，很輕便的一隻手提皮夾，快捷地跳下來，走出了月台，就算是他上海到了，一些也没有麻煩的事件，有的也是單身，不過他帶了不少累贅的行李，肩上背的也有，腕上挽的也有，手裏提的也有，可是他真覺得出門之苦，有的是帶了妻子或子女，行李與零碎東西也帶了不少，又要省錢，於是麻煩事件又發生了，自已的東西、呌妻子拿也不好，呌子女拿、又缺少力氣，在這様的境地中，我知道他是感到非常苦惱的，有的是寫意朋友，在車子上，祗須招呼一聲戴圓平頂帽的工役，就很平穏的代你拿了東西，走出月台，但是你要注意，給他們的酒錢，不可太少，也不可太多：太少，他當你『屈死』，太多，他要當你『洋盤』　　行李的車前，那時候也成爲閙市，工</p>
<p>役們，在車廂裏將那不當自已東西的别人行李，一件一件地亂堆亂摜的在月台上堆積着，你如帶有三件行李的話，那麽要想檢爲已有，至少要費却一刻鐘，都放在能看到的地方，當然是例外，他們會把你的三件行李分散，而且將别人的行理將你的推住，使你檢查不易，丨這是　於月台上的，</p>
<p>當你走出月台之後，雖然現在有了一</p>

<p>平常雇用要多出一倍以上的代價，有時還會把你的行李弄得没有影踪·</p>

<p>— 繼篆</p>
<p>吾聞之，萬事皆有一定之標準，救國問題，當然不能例外。標準云者，卽在範圍</p>
<p>内必能行者有數端，在範圍内必不能行者亦有數端也。救國若能明白訂立標準，則中材之士，乃知所使，殊尤之倫，亦知所止；好大喜功不可也，萎靡退縮亦不可也。夫國難一事，人人所未經騐，當喪師失地之時，全國學生，時時有揹手不及之表示，甲校學生，欲　名投義勇軍，乙校學生，欲買飛機充戰備：有真正馳赴前綫者，有真正傾囊捐助者；此乃孟子所謂『人性本善，苟能充之足以保四海也』。昧者不察，謂爲力小任重，謂爲杯水車薪，而竟未有大聲疾呼『連連樹立學界救國標準』者，此新舊學者應切實留心之一大端。應先由一校倡之，自有他校仿傚者也，譬如某一人家失火，火已起矣，家中大小人等，手忙脚亂，竟有置貴重衣箱而不搶出，獨到廚房中搶出一飯鍋者，此不能責其無搬運傢具之才，當恕其無家中失火之經騐。若夫上海救火會則不然，外間適纔起火，而救火隊員預備得齊齊整整，武裝以待，瞭望臺上一敲亂鐘，而救火隊機器車已到門外，一聽鐘聲表明方向街道，則已飛馳前往火塲共赴火難』矣，寻整以暇，各執各事，火勢斷不致蔓延，夫各校學生措手不及之表示，乃失火時搶出飯鍋之比。而全國新舊學者樹立救國標準，乃創立救火會之比也。</p>
<p>夫德法世仇，一百三十年中傾國孤注者幾次</p>
<p>，乃德國哲學敎授黑智亂ＨＥＧＥＬ，在燕那ＪＥＮＡ大學，於一八○六年拿破崙引兵壓境之日，在講堂上挾文稿而望窗外，戲評拿破崙爲『世界精神』（予見新版英文百科全書上有一幅漫畫）</p>
<p>此德國國難時哲學敎授之態度也。又德國化學敎授路易巴斯脱ＬＯＵＩＳＰＡＳＴＥＵＲ，避兵於亞爾波凹ＡＲＢＯＩＳ，於一八七○年俾斯麥克指定索割亞爾薩斯及羅蘭二州之日，巴斯脱曰；一試騐室的拚命，亦正如在調塲一様。』此法國國難時科學敎授之態度也。此兩公皆成爲以哲學華國以科學華國的赫赫大家，真所謂殷憂啓聖多難興邦者也。我國新的學者於此種歷史知之較熟，定能於籍中找出許多證據，亦樹立救國標準材料中之一種也。</p>
<p>至於舊的學者，我要大聲疾呼喚醒之曰，不</p>
<p>可以王通陳捕儲材以待自命，不可以顧亭林黄黎洲百年光復自命，今日之國難，不是國内小小政治昏亂之國難，乃是身爲奴隸滅絶人種的國難，須當以管仲樂毅自命，以墨子之徒有禽滑釐，鄭玄之徒有劉備，左光斗之徒有史可法自命，且萬不可在崖山舟中講大學，令顏習齋譏爲讀死書也。夫ＬＩＢＥＲＴＹ倘譯之爲仁字，何至全國綱維狂製，ＥＱＵＡＬＩＴＹ倘譯之義字，何至全國秩序紊亂，個人主義者，力惡其不出於身之謂，非謂利益必當專享也，勞工神聖者，貨惡其棄於地之謂，非謂屠夫卽是生佛也；唯物主義者，用原料於開物，精製造於成務，非謂『唯買物』也；天演歷程者，對内有互助之團結，對外用爭存之手段，非謂『棄禮讓』也。此諸　結者，學如諸葛亮，識如范仲淹，才如王陽明，理學如倭文端，善政如林則徐，一短簡之力，卽能　一中國視聽矣。尙何待講學而始明者。嗚呼！人窮則呼天，疾痛則呼父母，辛亥革命，有中西人丨『人道主義』四字之呼聲，而北洋派袁世凱之流，乃就孫總理之範，此次國聯調查，有合民族性』之呼聲，成者天心悔禍，國其有鳩乎？此則全中國人所應具有一廻天樞轉地軸』之精神者也。</p>

<h3 id="c224">新近蘇俄中小學課程及敎育行政上之改革（一）朱鎭蓀 <a href="#c224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>一、蘇俄學校敎育之失敗</p>
<p>蘇俄自頒布强迫敎育法律和施行修改的課程以</p>
<p>來、在中小學敎育方面確有相當的成績、這一點是蘇俄共産黨中央委員會所承認的、可是、在蘇俄學校中迄今還不免有許我缺點、最主要的爲學校中不能供給　生物理學·化學·數學·本國語言·地理·以及其他準備升入高等和專門學校的科目上的基本知識、這種失敗的主要原因乃在課程内的不充實、（特别爲高年級的課程）課室中作業方法之不良、敎育委員會和其機關不加指導、以及學校中缺乏嚴格的訓練、除此之外、還有一種缺點、就是學校的系統不能劃一、結果中小學往往不能應高等學校入學必修科目的需要、</p>
<p>二、新近課程之修改</p>
<p>蘇俄共産黨中央委員會鑒于學校中之缺點、故</p>
<p>於一九三一年九月五日通過改進中學課程議决案、处此以後中小學校的課程、特别是小學的課程已有相當的改進、並且課程的内容亦較以前爲充實、可是、中央委員會發現在課程之中仍有某種缺點、所以最後又建議修改第五第六及第七年級的課程、這三年級的課程他們認爲有以下的缺點、</p>
<p>（一）量的方面過多、結果學生只能迅速的從科目</p>
<p>中獲得少許的膚淺知識罷了、例如、七年級的數學科中的立體測量法的一部分特别是如此的、</p>
<p>（二）敎材彼此不劃一、例如、數學與圖書的敎材、以及數學·物理·化學和手工的敎材都是如此的、因此、在五年級中圖畫作業所城要的幾何學知識、至六年級時方始講授、再在高年級裏面物理學、往往又缺乏數學知識的蔡礎、</p>
<p>（三）某種科目的太簡單化、例如、引證物理學上的牛頓的定律和解釋生物學上的細胞的構這往往都是如此的、並且在地理科目上、學生總没有充分觀察地圖的機會、在社會科學上、往往發生許多政治上的错誤間題、</p>
<p>（四）社會科學中往往不注重歷史上的事實、所以</p>
<p>開於過去歷史上的人類地土、及社會的演化的事實、叙述很少、尙有一個最大的缺點就是他們迄今尙未預備一種歷史的學程、</p>
<p>結果共産黨中央委員會向蘇俄共和國的敎育委員會建議自一九三三年年正月一日開始修改中小學校所有的課程、俾可供給學生一種有系統的三『Ｒ』（卽讀寫算）的知識、這些課程的修改是根據以下的原則的、</p>
<p>（Ａ）數學·物理·化學·和生物學的敎材不論在</p>
<p>範圍和性質方面、都應適合兒意的班級年齡的、有許多科目的敎材應該减少、俾在這些基本的訓練上得有一種深固的根底、</p>
<p>（Ｂ）數學·物理·和化學教材·以及歷史·社會科學·和語言學的敎材、都應當彼此劃一、</p>
<p>（Ｃ）凡地方語言·數學·社會科學·物理·化學·及自然科學的講授、在可能的範圍之内、應與社會主義的組織的重要問題發生關係、</p>
<p>（Ｄ）關於社會科學·國語·文學地理、以及其他科目中的歷史方面的事實、應特别六重、</p>
<p>（Ｅ）增加數學的講授時間、俾學生在這種訓練方面能獲得充分的知識、以應升入高等學校之需要、</p>
<p>（Ｆ）在物理學中、應精細解釋牛頓的定律、在生物學上、應發揮人類的機體和細胞在槪念、此外、應設較有系統的化學學程、在講授地理時、須注重地圖上的知識、（特别關於蘇聯的地圖上的知識）以及地文地理和經濟地理的基本知識、資本主義國家的地理、亦應包括在課程之内、</p>
<p>（Ｇ）在中學校裏面至少要增加一種外國語、</p>
<p>（Ｈ）改良國語和社會科學和敎授法、</p>
<p>（Ｌ）在社會科學·文學·國語·地理·和歷史的科</p>
<p>目中、應介紹關於反蘇聯及其文學·美術·科學的人民的國家文化、</p>
<p>（Ｉ）在工藝學校、應注重手工作業、在敎授的</p>
<p>計畫中、應使工業中的生産工作與理論打成一片、</p>
<p>除上述以外、還須具備以以工藝知識的要素、例</p>
<p>如、電學上最低限度的主要知識、電汽在機械上的和化學工業上的應用的知識、此外爲獲得實際上的知識起見、學生還須參觀電汽工廠、並須具有善用工具木材、及金屬工作之才能、</p>

<h3 id="c225">『著』『敎』生尅論補 <a href="#c225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>— 曹聚仁</p>
<p>『著書都爲稻梁謀、儉腹高談我用憂。萬一飄零文字海。人問無地署無</p>
<p>愁。』</p>
<p>曹禮吾集龔定菴句</p>
<p>敎書十年。無不摇頭太息，此夏丐尊先生所以有『寗可早死。不做先生』之説</p>
<p>。賣稿十年，亦無不摇頭太息，此傳東華先生所以有『此路不通』之論。我敎書十三年，賣稿也差不多十來年，山窮水盡，浩然有歸志。昨协郁達夫先生的『著書與敎書』，怦然心動，覺得他所説的『著敎生尅論』，句句都是從肺腑中説出來的，句句『先得我心』。不過據我這挑過兩頭擔的人看來，生尅之道，尙不在著』，『敎兩職業的本身，而在本身以外。</p>
<p>『著』，『兩職業，近『自由職業者』的尊稱。職業果『自由』乎？還要問『自由談』的編者，談論果『自由』乎？彼此怕是同志：有『自由』之名，而無『自由『之實。著書的人，積意經騐、要想寫一本著作，蒐集材料五年，整理材料二年，然後磨墨伸紙、草寫二年，修正一年，然後大功，豈不是好？敎書的人，經年研究，創見疊出，然後登壇講述，深入淺出，左右逢源，説得頑石點頭，游魚仰沬，豈非一暢快事？自由職業者想必時常有此夢想，其於事實，究竟如何呢？書店老板限你三個月編成二十萬言的大著，不妨東抄西剪，母庸别出心裁。學店老板着你每星期任課二十四小時，大小七八様課程，現炒現賣，家無留貨。自由職業者所著所敎的書，無非是市塲上的商品：出得多，出得快，老板麥克麥克，方有『稻梁』可謀。至於『靈感』與『詩情』的永久失去與否，原不在老板算盤子打算之中。所以『著』與『敎』彼此相尅之時少，『著』『敎』同時被尅之時多：在資本主義的權勢之下，自由職業者的呼吸也短促得太可憐！　　依我的經騐，若以敎書爲稻梁的重心，以著書爲寄興；敎書那一方面固然苦死了人，著書這一方面却比較能依自已的計劃逐漸漸進行，完成一滿意的著作。或以著書爲稻梁的重心，以敎書爲寄興，每星期任課二三小時；興之所至，亦能全堂肅靜無聲，如吃人參果，混身舒暢的。或變更計劃，把稻梁的重心寄託在别一職業上，把『著書』『敎書』都當作寄興的事業，於賣稿算稿費，敎書算薪水之外，有自由創作的餘地，不相尅而相生，其成就必更有可觀。周作人先生説：『大家最好不要以創作爲專門的事業、應該於創作之外，另有技能，另有職業，這様對文學將更有好處。單依文學爲謀生之具，這様的人如加多起來，勢必製成文學的堕落。』（中國新文學的源流）可見以『著』『敎』爲副業，或是保全『靈感』與『詩情』的别一大道。</p>

<p>總而言之，知識分子是已經走到末路了！</p>

<p>— 靜子</p>
<p>故鄉人來，説本省現又抽收救國捐，總數是五百萬，每縣各攤派數</p>
<p>萬至十數萬不等，並限期繳納。所謂攤</p>
<p>派，即是按照田賦攤派到一般農民身上。然而現在本省每兩田賦，附加各種捐税已達到四十多元，這即是説附加税要超過正貢十數倍。想到『五百萬元』這一鉅大數字，我的心頭便感到莫名的重壓，我不知道在五百萬這一數字下，該演出多少賣兒鬻女的悲劇。但，假如抽捐而真是爲了『救國』，賣兒鬻女又誰説不是應該的呢？</p>
<p>不過，湖南也許此四川還略勝一籌。</p>
<p>據中國銀行編印的四川月報載：二十軍在本年三月間，開徴四十九年糧税，限四十日收齊；二十四軍在二十一年以前，一年四徴，去秋從三十六年徴至三十八年，又徴收國防捐二十五元，九月到十一月又自三十降年徴至四十一年，十二月又自四十二年徵至四十四年，今年二月又徵收四十五六兩年；二十八軍規定每兩月徴糧一次·即年徴六年，本年三月起，又開徴六十二三年糧税，並限期收齊，逾限者加一徴收，據説是『以儆疲玩』。每年六徴糧税，現在還是民國二十三年，糧税竟已徴至六十三年，我真佩服中國軍人一希鵝取金蛋』的精神。</p>
<p>聽説陜甘諸省，以捐税以榨壓，有土之農，甚至較一般佃農與僱農尤爲艱苦。因爲佃農與僱農捐税的榨壓還比較少一點，而一般自耕農則背着『有土』的名，根本無力應付繁重的捐税，於是相率挈男携女，貼田地的契據於門上·甘心流離輾轉，散之四方。古詩『二月賣新絲，五月糶新榖』，一般人已經認爲是』醫得眼前瘡，剜却心頭肉，』現在呢？現在是一片賣兒鬻女的呼聲，與易子而食的慘劇，正猛如虎，人民怎得不窮。農村經濟怎得不日益破産呢？</p>
<p>政府現在正在高喊救濟農村，更有人主張中國應仿美國救濟農村的辦法。我想，與其高談救濟，第一着還是不如先禁止『殺鵝取蛋』罷！</p>

<p>— 伍</p>
<p>好日過後第三天，客人都陸續散了。</p>
<p>我也上廠裏去作工。一清早就離開那温軟軟的新床，離開那脈脈含羞的新娘起來。我低低的告訴她，我要上工去。她蹙着眉不響，我推想她有心事，戀戀不捨，但我又覺得她在討厭我，抱怨我。她三天來不曾和我説過一句話。這是害羞罷？：：</p>
<p>於是我不再多説，穿好平常的工衣</p>
<p>，把昨晚剩來的飯，照例盛了一盒，出來囑託樓下的張大嫂，呌他陪新娘。她剛剛來，一切都不熟習，并且也有些寂寞。張大嫂也着眼笑道：</p>
<p>『你放心去罷，人家不會薄待你的新</p>
<p>娘的。谁還偷了她去？』</p>
<p>『就只不放心你，怕你要偷。』我一面</p>
<p>和她打趣，一面輕輕爽爽的出來，心裏熱烘烘的，充滿了一團歡喜。馬路上上工去的男男女女擁擠得很，我覺得他們都在向我露着笑臉，和我打趣。我如今是世界上最幸福的。丨我今年三十二歲了，阿爸和娘過後，就一直光身到現在。這十幾年的日子是多麽孤單啊。然而我如今有女人了，十幾年來的寂寞和辛苦，算是有了報償。我如今是最幸福的：：而况新娘那麽白白的瓜子臉兒，兩眼盈盈的迷人，生得并不算壞呢。</p>
<p>我走進廠去，今天纔覺出廠裏是這麽</p>
<p>黝暗，機器這麽龐雜，機聲這麽繁囂。我對於一切都有些生分起來。同夥們看見我來了，都含着笑臉嘮嘮叨叨的問長問短。</p>
<p>『喂，老婆怎麽様？』</p>
<p>『原路貨麽？』</p>
<p>『開心哩，晚上没有睡罷？』</p>
<p>『就捨得分開嗎？那味道好不好？</p>
<p>』</p>
<p>這一類有趣的話像雨點一様落到我身</p>
<p>上。我竟成了他們間的中心人物了。我平常是不大被人理會的。我很感激他們，所以我愉快的招呼他們。那摩温今天也走來在我的肩上拍拍，拉下了他那凶神的臉孔。先生們走過，聽見别人尋我開心，也不干涉，只向我笑笑。這是多麽幸福？有了女人的人，會如此被人尊敬。</p>
<p>我今年三十二，女人不過二十一，我比她長了十一歲。我一面工作，一面聽見耳邊好像有人説；你如今成了家了，人家都尊敬你。你比女人長十一歲，你應該多多的痛她，使她過點好日子。你要發奮，你要多積些錢，不久你就會有孩子了。你要發奮。：：你比女人長了十一歲。：：</p>
<p>於是我就决心從今天起，竭盡我所有</p>
<p>的力量，一個人做下兩個人的工，要求先生們給我兩倍工餉。晚上放工回去，我還要尋一點另外的事做做。</p>
<p>在工廠的日子是多麽長啊，我今天纔</p>
<p>覺处時間走得這麽慢。和平常一様，是十二個鐘頭，但我以爲足足過了一年。我不知道我的新娘在家已經怎様了。聽説她自已是能燒飯能做一切事的。我想起今天回去，已經有人把飯燒好在等着，是多麽有味。我如今是有了家了。：　　好容易等到廠裏吹放工的號聲，忙忙</p>
<p>的從人叢中擠出來，一路上，心跳得很利害，我想這是歡喜的緣故。我的心已經失了常態了。</p>
<p>走回工房，弄堂裏的人們，都用希奇</p>
<p>的眼光看我，似乎要從我身上搜尋一點什麽，從我身身前瞪到身後，證到我的背春。難道我身上，我的家裏發生了什麽事體？丨我家裏是有人燒着飯等我的。</p>
<p>在門口，遇見了張大嫂。她一看見我</p>
<p>就拉着我的手，似乎有些發抖。踏進大門，我説，『她呢』？</p>
<p>『她嗎？我今天下午出去了半天、剛</p>
<p>纔回來，已經不見了。』</p>
<p>『不見了。我四處都尋過，連影也不</p>
<p>見。有人看見她挾着衣包出去了，你去看，新房中已弄得一塌糊塗。丨她逃走了丨』</p>
<p>逃走了。有這様的事？我跑上扶梯，</p>
<p>踢開房門，果然見衣物零亂的在床上地下，板箱開着。她已經不住房中。　　我覺得四肢發軟，眼前漆黑。我向一</p>
<p>張椅上坐去，椅跟着我的身體一同倒下。我現在又舉目無親，孤零零的，只剩下一人，我覺得我已再没有生活下去的勇氣丨</p>

<p>— ＪＵＩＥＳＫＥＮＡＲＱ林到譯</p>
<p>紅頰　一（續）</p>
<p>可是，這次有人回答他了：</p>
<p>『是的又怎様呢？』</p>
<p>紅蘿蔔鬚把腰一縮便回到被窩裏去了。</p>
<p>監舉先生又出場了，他是突然現出來的。</p>
<p>二</p>
<p>『不錯，』威奥説，『我　曾吻過你，瑪梭；』這事你可以承認的，因爲你絶没有做错什麽。</p>
<p>我曾在你的額上吻過，但小小年紀便堕落了的紅蘿蔔鬚是不能了解這　的，他不會曉得這是一個純潔無垢的接吻，一個父親給兒子的接吻，他不知道我喜歡你像喜歡自已的兒子一様的，祇要你願意，也可以説像兄弟一様的，他明天會到處亂説，這蠢才丨當威奥龍説到這裏，聲音氣得發抖的時候，紅蘿蔔鬚却假裝睡着了。但他還把頭拾起來聽着。</p>
<p>瑪校屏聲靜氣地聽那監學先生説話，他雖然覺得他的話非常自然，可是他渾身戰慄着，好像害怕着什麽神秘的啓示似的。威奥龍繼續説着，盡力把聲音放低。這是一些糢糊不清的字句，一些飄忽不定的音綴。睡在床上不敢轉身的紅蘿蔔鬚，雖把腰身輕輕移動，不知不覽地靠近來，這時也什麽都不聽見了。他的注意力興奮到了極點，他覺得自已的兩只耳孕確實已經成了兩個窟窿，並且那窟窿口擴大起來成了漏斗似的：可是却没有一點音響落進這漏斗裏面來。</p>
<p>他記起間常在門外竊聽什麽的時候，也曾得到過同様努力的感覺，那時一面聽着，一面把眼睛靠在鑰匙孔上窺望，心裏恨不得將那鑰匙孔弄大起來，把自已所要偷看的東西像用一隻鐵鈎鈎着似的，拉近來看個明白，可是他這時確確實實地聽見威奥龍復説道：</p>
<p>『是啦，我的愛是純潔的，純潔的，而這便是那蠢才所不能了解的呀！』</p>
<p>末李，監學先生以一種隂影般的温柔把身子彎下來，在瑪梭的額上吻着，他下巴底下的那撮鬍像毛筆般的在瑪梭的額上撫弄着，隨後他再把身子豎直起來向外面走，紅蘿蔔鬚把兩眼緊緊跟着他，望見他在那一排一排的床舗中間擦過。當威奥龍的手觸着别人的枕頭時，被擾醒的人便很重地歎口氣把身子翻過一邊。（未完）</p>

<p>的血液，頭頂着『中華民國』國籍的人類，應怎様的團結奮起，力圖自救，然而事實告訴我們正相反。</p>
<p>國難發生，已將二載，在這二年中，東北三四千萬倫陷在異族鐵蹄下的民</p>
<p>衆的痛苦，是不能想像，即全國的民衆，因帝國主義加緊其侵略政策，而致農村崩潰，國民經濟破産，四萬七千四百萬人口中，除了少數高官厚禄的高等華人，尙得優遊於舞塲劇院之外。，其餘的人已深深的更打入了一重深淵。</p>
<p>但帝國主義者的砲聲，轟不醒迷醉人的夢，更改不過來軍閥的頭腦。在這國難發生以來的二年中，關於戰事的消息，我們已看得不少，除了東北義勇軍與十九路軍忠勇抗日的民族戰外，又曾聽到廣東二陳的火併，山東韓劉的衝突，四川劉湘劉文輝的叔姪相斫，黔有新疆康藏等的内閧，我們真不能用算盤來計算類端被犧牲於這些題目之下的生命與財産。凡是身預諸役的同胞，在痛哭流涕逃亡之餘，一想到給予痛苦的，就是自已平日所豢養的人，一定要説『活該』丨</p>
<p>異族的侵毠屠殺，我們知道是要滅亡人國，但軍閥們的肆行戰爭與署殺，</p>
<p>是不是要滅亡民族，這在軍閥一定是很明瞭，祗是我們這輩醉生夢死的『阿斗』，還茫無所知，竭脂膏來養劊子手屠殺自已。</p>
<p>家中所養的狸哭，牠們的慾望是容易饜足的，而且多少還可以捕鼠守夜，</p>
<p>替主人盡點力，軍閥則不然，越是你養得他們胖胖的，想求其無事，那未給予。你的痛苦也越深。在國内號稱富饒之區的四川，田賦不是已預徴到民國六十年嗎？兒孫時代的賦税都已代完，這順民也可以説『順』到極點了，照理該得太平無事，坐享餘年。然而所得相等的代價是二十年中四百七十八次戰爭的實習，拜受盡了流亡之慘。</p>
<p>最近四川省的軍閥劉文輝鄧錫侯，又因『利害衝突』，而重興起戰禍，造成四川省第四百七十九次内戰内的紀録。據報載這一次戰爭，戰綫擯至八百華里，動員至四十萬人，其規模的宏大，與蘇馬李杜及十九路軍之孤軍抗日，呼援無應的，相去不可以道里計，於將來的民國史上是值得大書時書的一般人一。提到對外，便説『軍火缺乏』，『運輸不便』，但一到對内，則新式戰器，應俱全。這種忽隠忽現的兵機妙算，五花八門，在我們這班『阿斗』除了贊嘆，還有什麽話説。</p>
<p>每逢一次内戰發生，照例的各方要發出許多電文，『電懇』電令。但也照例的要等到有一方打敗了之後，才有人出來接受即所謂『懇』與『令』丨佔勝利的還是槍砲，祇是一般『阿斗』就在這接受與不接受之間被犧牲了。至於戰爭的結果，『勝則王』，名稱自然是『討逆』。敗的一方呢，也就如元老先生的敎訓，拱拱手曰『五年後再見』於是五年，或不待五年之後，正義又轉了方向，第二次的『討逆』又起，這様以至第三，第四，第四百七十九，第：：次，而『阿斗』之流，便永遠在人家利害的夾缝中間喘息着。</p>
<p>通電，已成爲救國與應付萬事的唯一方劑，這次自不能例外，於是有全川七千萬民衆的通電呼籲，行政院的電令制止，但事實所昭告我們的，這種呼籲的電報，等於喊呌『上帝救我』。任你説得痛哭流涕，决不會少動殺人魔王的心，那末『一念之轉，即可達到』（川民佳電原文）的保全我們生命財産唯一的有效方法，是。</p>

<p>— 寸心</p>
<p>假如我有一個小孩’我將怎様去敎</p>
<p>養他我常想。</p>
<p>第一’我知道理想中的孩子’應該</p>
<p>有一個理想的母親來撫養他。這個理想的母親’性情不必大世故’但無妨過於天真。技能至少要懂得一點藝術’和會講幾只故事。因爲孩子們的心是輕靈而又美麗的’須有美麗的環境來適應他。當孩子睡在摇床裏的時候’理想的母親’應時常奏一些風琴曲之類給他聽。因爲無形之美’莫過於音樂’而又是孩子們所最能聆受的。至孩子床的安放’自然頻有一個美麗而活潑的環境。屋内凡上來上　没有真的花朶’紙花也得備些。牆上與其掛一些義法高深的山水’不如掛一些彩然渲染的水彩畫。但到孩子長大了，那末給他看厭了的水彩畫中，又須挿上一些偉人（包括：革命家，科學家，思想家，文學家，藝術家等，而黨國要人不預也）的相片，使他們因這些新鮮的材料，而獲得人生的啓示。倘然哭泣，這在孩子們是常有的事，你須檢查他這反應的源泉，是乳不足？還是寒煖？告訴你，切莫因姑息而去抱持他，因爲小孩子的一切舉動，原没有預言的目標，而多年是書試，書試得不對，他自會改正，你切莫給他以不良的暗示。復次，倘若他已能走路，而玩厭了呢人木偶的時候，你不妨敎他去親近那些小貓小狗小鷄小鴨之類，這可以使他和外物接觸，而養成他慈愛的同情心，决不止是賞鑑賞鑑那一些嬌小的聲音，鵝黄的羽毛，玲瓏的體態而已。倘他已有知識的需要，那未理想的母親，便應當時常給他講一些故事。故事要美麗，但荒誕的故事，也些有一個範圍，小鷄小鴨的游歷小貓小狗的打架也是不妨，因爲到將來他自能證實這不過是一個故事。但倘你講了神仙，那未這迷惑。却使他永遠難拔。更不可講得醜惡，如鬼怪之類，剌傷他們美麗的心。總之，這一切的技術，是每一個理想的母親所應熟練而不須細講的。再倘如他因一時玩得起勁把你所心愛的鐘表，或其他的物件弄壞，那你也不應憤怒而去責罰他，須知這是創造的初步，你當帮助他去弄好。世上的事，原没有一就可成的。不可憑你成人階段的經騐而去斥責没有經騐的孩子，消極的斥責，還不如積極的鼓勵，你的責任，便是怎様去增高小孩子們學習的興趣。更須記得的，是當人的孩子在做他們象徴的游戲時，你切莫去撞毁他畫在地上的屋，踏傷了他想像中的人物，這也是一種殘酷，足以剌傷他們美麗的心的。而你有時在工作，如蒔花養鴿的時候，你不妨呌你的孩子們帮忙，這在他們，一定是藥於從命的。而也可以學得一點常識，在他們一定要覺得比上自然課有趣。最要緊的話，是呌孩子們做事，須使他覺得這是游戲，而不</p>
<p>是沉悶的苦工。</p>
<p>最後我們要知道，敎導孩子的目的，在使他有處世應事的獨立的人格與技能，而父母的養務，也盡於上述兩項工作完成立後。所以我常想。假使我有錢，買得起代步物的話，我决不願使兒子坐了包車上學，而將爲他買一輛自由車，聽他去把鼻子和眼睛撞在一起，手與脚，折成八段，我相信多一次失敗，必多一次成功，做父母的責任是在引導孩子走上獨立的道路，而决不在於做一世的『牛馬。』</p>
<p>且把我的意見貢獻於已做或將做父</p>
<p>的男女們。</p>

<h3 id="c269">明星們到了中年 <a href="#c269" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e269" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">269</a></h3>
<p>— 仲琴</p>
<p>不鋗有色衷廢棄之危險祇好藉遊歷旅行而下場</p>
<p>好萊塢的電影區域之中’新的明星像雨後春筍一役’一顆一顆的’向影壇</p>
<p>上跳起來’没有一個時候的休止。而同時已經過了中年以上的許多明星’一批一批的漸漸失去了光芒。那些老明星們’知足的呢’息跡休養去了’遊歷旅行去了：不知足的·漸漸没有人捧了’星光消失了’漸漸歸於失敗了’没落了。這俔現象’在好萊塢無時或止’新陳代謝’當然是世界上任何事物所不能避免的歷程’但是在好萊塢的電影城中’這新舊交替的現象更爲顯著。</p>
<p>有人説’好萊塢的影壇好像政治舞臺’變幻不可推測的’這倒是一個確</p>
<p>切不移的比喻。在好萊塢的女星們’好們依靠了青春時代’在好萊塢謀了一個地位’能够使地位維持到五年以上的’已經是很不容易的事’至於一顆紅星’决没有紅到幾年的。在好萊塢的明星’留在影界至十年的’能有幾人？及至青年時代一過’在好萊塢的機亦隨之而消減。到了中年時代’萬不能再在好萊塢涺留了’即使有幾個’像曼麗畢克馥’新近仍舊在好萊塢演了一部聯藝公司出品『秘密』’然而她的一半是依靠了往年的名譽’還有一半是靠了好的化裝術’使好萊塢的人的看不出她已經是半老的徐娘了。再則這部『秘密』’還是她幾年前前就開始攝的’至於後好是否願意工作’則猶在未之天也。再舉一個例’波拉妮葛麗’當初榮任好萊塢電影皇后時’何等風光’現在却並不再能得到往日的榮耀了’最近在上海開映的『禍水』一片’無疑地是好的末次作品了。</p>
<p>至於説曼麗特蘭漱是個老太婆’怎會做好萊塢的皇后呢？曼麗特蘭漱實在</p>
<p>是好萊塢有史以來僅有的一個’祇能算例外’况且她雖然也做了皇后’但是演的老角’愈老醜則愈好’自不能同專靠青春賣錢的許多明星們相提並論的。　　好萊塢的女星們’對於她們中年到臨是極恐怖的。她們唯一避免顯露中年</p>
<p>的方法’是化裝’但是人工終究是假的。因之她們一到中年時代’仍舊一個個的淘汰下去’而不能倖免’息跡休養’長途旅行’不過是她們下塲時的幌子。滄海桑田’亦天然之趨勢也。</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3 id="c270">再評『前程』 <a href="#c270" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e270" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">270</a></h3>
<p>— 明</p>
<p>的確’這張影片’第一個失敗的所</p>
<p>在’就是劇本的意識力太薄弱’我們可以看出第一個劇中人’前後都有非常矛盾的動作思想’（由字幕告訴我們）突然的轉變’便呌人覺得影片中的一些人是類似虚構的’没有統一的個性’這様已經够呌劇情散漫到極點了’何况中心意義’也不能明白交代呢？所謂『女子職業的前程』’就僅是女伶去恢復她的舊業嗎？它毫未指示一條光明的出路’我並非説優雙不是一種職業’不過大多數人必須承認作優伶終非一個長久的職業’色老藝衰’就要落伍的’那末女子職業也就是暫時的嗎？</p>
<p>而且編劇者似乎是反對戀愛結婚的人’夫婦間一有了隔膜’就應該離開’絶不許悔過以後’再結合的’這一點恐怕也非情理所許吧’不錯’一個男子可以同時和許多女子來往’而女子不能再和丈夫以外任何人去談交際。的確’這是社會畸形的現象’所以編劇者也似乎不應當給那個作『官的人’不容妻子有外遇’而施以過份的懲罰’不容他悔過’因爲他根本没有知道妻子爲他而犧牲’所以才大翻臉’這是一件情有可原的事。</p>
<p>導演也疏忽太過’對於佈景等等’只盡力求其富麗堂堂’而没有想到現實是否應當如此。對於演員的支配’也很不適當’在小的地方’都有漏洞可尋。　　攝影不錯’鏡頭移動’也很活潑’但是由鏡中反照的特寫用得太多’呌人厭倦。光線在國産片中’明星公司是最好的’這次也保持着已往的或績。　　宣景琳雖不免有些『美人遲暮』’但表演尙好’不少地方有些新劇化’也應當由導演員責的。孫敏太謹慎了’所以也就太呆板。王吉亭一望而知是作戰’不過形容一般花花公子式的市儈’還有可取之處。朱秋痕表演太過火’把一位女秘書身份完全失掉了。</p>
<p>字幕比較是好的’簡明而有深意’分幕也遠不紊亂。</p>

<p>— 馮瑛</p>
<p>無疑地’在女權達到澎湃時期的現今</p>
<p>’社會上的各種職業’亦漸漸地有着女子挿足的機會’過去的那種『倚靠男子而生』的封建現象’已經受着時代的淘汰而將趨漸消減了’然而在這新舊過程的交替中’『倚靠男子而生活』的女子’仍不在少數’同時玩弄女姓的男子’當然没有根本消滅。</p>
<p>這次在中央開映的明星是『前程』’就</p>
<p>整個的意義和劇情來講’很明顯地是要警醒『倚靠男子而一活』’被男子作玩物的女性’而指示她們的出路丨自立’的確是給時代的女子’一個偉大的啓示’值得我們的着。</p>
<p>劇情中君傑做官後在辦公室中毫無顧</p>
<p>忌他和女秘書的放浪’我認這種祇上登徒子’急色兒的描寫’真真做官的恐未必有這種的怪現象吧丨最後在蘭英臨走的一幕中’君傑拿『女子離開了男人怎麽呢？』的一句話’去打進『倚靠男子而生活』的女子弱點’但蘭英有一技之長’給於離開那給男子玩弄式的生活’而獨謀她自立的前程去了。</p>
<p>張石川的導手段’較以前確是進步</p>
<p>多了’他對於劇情方面’處處不肯放鬆一步’這片不失爲他的成功功。</p>
<p>演員方面’我們和宣景琳久違了’這</p>
<p>次在銀幕上告訴我們’她的藝術確是不錯’孫敏和朱秋痕的表情很逼真’餘皆平平？</p>
<p>總之　該片是緊抓住了社會上一部份</p>
<p>『倚靠明子而生活』的女子弱點’下一個警告’同時對以女性作玩物的男子’給他一個極度的棒喝。</p>
<h3 id="c273">『前程』是女性的出路的引導 <a href="#c273" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e273" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">273</a></h3>
<p>— 喻家卿</p>
<p>在每一張影片’牠的題名’都是銜</p>
<p>着藝術性的；如最近的『除夕』’『覺悟』</p>
<p>’『女性的呐喊』’和『都會的早晨』『：：</p>
<p>等’『前程』也是其中的一張’在報上牠的廣已宣傳得很久了’今天是在中央大戲院初次公映’爲了要嘗試該片的藝術’所以持地趁了車去欣賞一下。</p>
<p>本片的劇情告訴我們’倚靠男性是</p>

<p>明星影片公司’自從『女性的呐喊』</p>
<p>放映以後’譽論界的批評’都已一致推崇。並且新近所出的幾闻片子’都是對於婦女問題’很有深切的啓示和解釋。當然’這顯明的進步’委實是值得我們欽佩的。</p>
<p>可是今天公映於中央的『前程』’却</p>
<p>有些使人感到失望了丨這雖然是丁謙平先生’繼『脂粉市塲』『以後的又一傑作’』</p>
<p>但是在下去不敢完全附和與贊同。</p>
<p>『前程』尤其是女人的『前程』’是多</p>
<p>們動人的一個名詞’而得注意的一件事啊丨在本片中；它啓示了許多婦女’對於自已『前程』的認識’它意思是説；女人嫁了丈夫以後’不要完全沉醉在愛河之中而依靠丈夫：要自已繼續不斷地爲自已的『前程』努力丨如本片中的主角’是個紅女伶蘇蘭英’她爲嫁了丈夫’而抛棄了自已的舞台生活’這根本就不是她的前程。而她的丈夫’又是個用情不專的留學生’一旦平步青雲’高陛了處長了職’便一變本來面目’喜新懨舊’另有所愛；甚至還要侮辱她’責打她；於是蘭英猛然省悟了丨她不甘爲男子所侮辱’爲自已人格計’爲自已的『前程』一計’仍舊去過她固有的舞台生涯；這便是前程的歸宿。</p>
<p>綜合言之’這部『前程』的意識無論</p>
<p>如何總使我有些失望’和不完全的滿意；因爲牠没有切實的指示’和解釋怎様是前程？和『脂粉市塲』相比較’顯然是退步了丨</p>
<p>關於演員的表情’飾蘇蘭英的宣景琳’最合身份；孫敏顯然是比『脂粉市』塲』中進步了！王吉亨他素以反角著名的’在這片中倒還成功：顧蘭君表演最自然’可惜出塲次數太少。比外導演的技巧’演員的表情’以及其他撮影布景等’是值得一觀的。</p>

<p>Hope Emerges for Peace, Authorities Deny Compromise with Japan</p>
<p>(Peiping) On the afternoon of the 23rd, an American teacher received a phone call from Tongzhou stating that the Japanese army had indeed not advanced. Although the residents of Peiping and Tientsin have experienced extreme fear in recent days, they are now slightly more stable. Based on the information I have obtained from various sources, and observing it comprehensively, it seems that there has been a turning point in the prospects for peace. However, it is definitely not as optimistic as some rumors suggest, that we and the Japanese have reached some kind of understanding on a peaceful resolution. The problem lies in the fact that we are unwilling to yield, and the Japanese are also not easily subdued. (Central News Agency dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Peiping) The political climate here fluctuates wildly, making it impossible to grasp. Last night it was quite pessimistic, but this morning it suddenly turned optimistic. By this afternoon, officials from both the Chinese and Japanese sides acknowledged that the overall situation was somewhat more hopeful. A high-ranking Chinese official denied the rumor circulating in Tientsin that a ceasefire agreement had been signed this morning, saying that nothing had been signed. (Reuters dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Peiping) It seems that Peiping can avoid being occupied by foreign troops. It is now believed that the ceasefire arrangements stipulate that the Japanese army will advance to Yanqing, Changping, Shunyi, Gaoliying, Tongzhou, Xianghe, Baodi, Lintang, and Ninghe. The Chinese army will withdraw within that line, and then Chinese and Japanese representatives will negotiate the details regarding the area within the Great Wall. If successful, the Japanese and Chinese will retreat to the Great Wall. Unless the negotiations break down later, there should be no further fighting. (Reuters dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>Wang Says No Capitulation</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Wang Jingwei told a reporter from a certain news agency that the Japanese army's attempt to seize Peiping and Tientsin and its aggressive advance means the country has no choice but to resist. With every ounce of strength, we will resist and will never capitulate. Rumors of compromise are completely unfounded. The situation in Peiping and Tientsin is urgent. Key military and political figures in Peiping, such as He Yingqin and Huang Fu, have sent telegrams to Nanking seeking instructions. (Special dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>British and French Envoys Offer Mediation</p>
<p>(Peiping) The tense situation has reached a critical juncture. It is reported that the British and French envoys intend to offer mediation late on the night of the 22nd. (Special dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>The Four Conditions Proposed by the Japanese Side</p>
<p>(Peiping) During the peace negotiations, the Japanese proposed four conditions: (1) The central army must withdraw south of the Yellow River; (2) China must not station troops within eighty li of the Great Wall; (3) Anti-Japanese organizations must be explicitly abolished; (4) Chinese military authorities must apologize to Japan. Our side finds these unreasonable demands difficult to accept. The Japanese still claim that we have no sincerity for peace and have announced a breakdown in negotiations. (Special dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>The Two Armies Maintained Original Positions Yesterday</p>
<p>(Peiping) This morning, the two armies maintained their original positions, and the situation along the entire line was calm. In Sanhe, Jixian, Zunhua and other places east of Peiping, after being occupied by the Japanese army, people in these areas were forced to hang the flags of the puppet state. Those who violated this order were shot. (Special dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>U.S. Embassy Calls in Marines to Protect Nationals</p>
<p>(Peiping) The U.S. Embassy will bring in marines from Tanggu to Peiping to protect American nationals. The Peiping-Liaoning Railway is preparing vehicles. (Telegram, 23rd)</p>
<p>Students in Peiping Leave the City in Droves</p>
<p>(Peiping) After schools in Peiping were suspended, students left the city in droves, reaching more than one-third of the total. (Special dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>A Snippet of a Conversation with Nakamura, Japanese Commander</p>
<p>(Tientsin) Nakamura, the commander of the Japanese army stationed here, told British and American reporters that people in Chinese and Japanese diplomatic circles were conducting peace negotiations, and that Japanese military personnel had expressed their support two weeks ago. Unfortunately, it is now too late, and the military cannot agree. (Special dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>Peace Negotiations Not Proceeding Smoothly</p>
<p>(Peiping) According to Chinese sources, the Japanese side recently sent an unofficial notification to the Chinese side, demanding that the demands put forward by the Japanese side be accepted within three days, otherwise the war will break out again. The conditions between the Chinese and Japanese sides are too far apart. Last night, Huang Fu and He Yingqin held another military meeting, and the atmosphere was extremely pessimistic. Today, Huang Fu denied the rumor that the peace talks had broken down and said, "Formal consultations have not yet begun." Chinese newspapers also stated that peace is not yet hopeless. The newspapers also reported that the result of last night's military meeting was that the Japanese were not sincere and that peace was hopeless. If the Japanese were truly sincere about peace, then when the Chinese army stopped resisting and withdrew, the Japanese army should have stopped fighting and should not have advanced further. (Reuters dispatch, 23rd) The Generals are Willing to Fight to the End</p>
<p>(Tientsin) A reporter recently visited a certain important person. According to the discussion, our side stopped fighting and withdrew troops in order to seek peace. The Japanese side asked for too high a price, so we could not bargain. The generals gathered in Peiping and agreed to fight to the end. Yesterday, Peiping and Tientsin made the final decision to prepare for war. (Special dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>Defensive Work Still Underway</p>
<p>(Peiping) The rumor circulating in Tokyo that the Japanese army is now only three kilometers away from Peiping is completely unfounded. The closest Japanese sentries are several miles east of Tongzhou. However, according to reliable sources, the peace negotiations are not proceeding smoothly. There will soon be disturbances in the Peiping-Tientsin area. It is said that because the Japanese army is not far from Peiping, the demands put forward by the Japanese side cannot be recognized by the military leaders here. Defensive work outside the city of Peiping is still underway. If the peace talks fail, there may be fierce fighting again. The whole city of Peiping is now full of soldiers, all determined to fight to the last man. The attitude of the Japanese side has also become tougher since yesterday morning, and it is expected that there will be serious developments within 48 hours. (Reuters dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<h3 id="e2">Many Refugees Arriving in Tientsin <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>(Tientsin) Many troops stationed in Yangcun. Women and children fleeing to Tientsin have reached more than 3,000. The Charity Federation has set up five shelters, which are still not enough, and is rushing to build reed sheds in Hedong. (Special dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Tientsin) Because of the serious situation yesterday, residents of Peiping came to Tientsin to take refuge on the morning of the 23rd. Every train was packed, and luggage was piled up like mountains. When the train leaving Peiping for Tientsin at 8:00 a.m. passed Yongdingmen, a Japanese plane followed for reconnaissance but did not drop any bombs and turned back.

<h3 id="e3">Japan Violates Treaty by Increasing Troops Stationed in Peiping; Six Hundred Japanese Troops Transported to Peiping. <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Six Japanese Planes Arrive in Peiping Again to Intimidate</p>
<p>(Peiping) Military news: On the 23rd, a total of 600 infantrymen of the Japanese army departed from Tientsin for Peiping, carrying a large number of weapons, ammunition, artillery, and machine guns. The Japanese are increasing troops in Peiping under the pretext of the Boxer Protocol to protect overseas Chinese, but Peiping is extremely quiet, and this move by the Japanese may have other purposes. Moreover, the Boxer Protocol clearly stipulates a limit of only 200 troops to be stationed. Now, the increase of such a large army actually contradicts the number stipulated in the Boxer Protocol. It is generally believed that this move has alarmed and unsettled overseas Chinese from various countries. (Central News Agency dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Tientsin) 252 Japanese soldiers stationed in Tientsin requested a special train on the Peiping-Liaoning Railway. They left for Peiping at 7:30 a.m. on the 23rd, carrying a large number of machine guns, steel cannons, and military supplies. (Special dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Peiping) Today, 600 Japanese soldiers from Tientsin arrived here by train and are now stationed in the Japanese barracks. There are currently 1,700 Japanese nationals in Peiping, and each Japanese soldier can protect two overseas Chinese. It is reported that the Chinese authorities had intended to refuse to prepare vehicles for transportation, but the highest authorities prepared vehicles due to treaty relations. (Reuters dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Peiping) Six hundred Japanese soldiers arrived here this morning from Tientsin as reinforcements for the Japanese Embassy guard. The strength of the Japanese Embassy guard is now three times greater than usual. (Reuters dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Peiping) The Miyazaki unit, which was dispatched from Tientsin this morning, arrived at Qianmen Station at 12:15 p.m., disembarked, and entered the Japanese barracks. (Reuters dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Peiping) After 7:30 a.m. this morning, three large single-winged Japanese bombers were spotted in the skies over Peiping, flying low for as long as an hour. It is reported that the Japanese planes deliberately flew low at a height of 200 feet in various places to intimidate the public. When the American army was drilling on the drill field, the Japanese plane also flew over the U.S. Embassy at a very low altitude, nearly colliding with the U.S. military barracks' radio station. The Japanese authorities claimed this afternoon that the Japanese army is only three Chinese li from Tongzhou, but foreign nationals and foreign students are still staying there. (Reuters dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Peiping) After Japanese residents requested protection from the Japanese Embassy yesterday, 500 Japanese soldiers arrived at the East Station from Tientsin at 12:00 noon. The Japanese chargé d'affaires, Zhongshan, was on the scene to take care of them. (Havas dispatch, 23rd)</p>

<p>(Peiping) At 7:55 a.m. this morning, six Japanese planes came to the skies over Peiping, circling for 50 minutes, flying back and forth for low-altitude reconnaissance.

<p>(Peiping) A telegram from Tongzhou says that the Japanese army in Yanjiao Town shelled Tongzhou across the river dozens of times again at 4:00 p.m. today, seemingly intending to cover its infantry crossing the river. All important agencies in Tongzhou have been ordered to evacuate to predetermined locations to ensure safety. (Special dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Peiping) A telegram from Changping reports that at 10:00 a.m. this morning, more than 2,000 Japanese army infantry and cavalry units, with 30 to 40 cannons and more than 10 tanks, launched a fierce attack on the headquarters at Niulanshan under cover.

(Special dispatch, 23rd) (Peiping) A phone call from Shuangqiao says that a shell landed on a mosque in Tongxian County, killing eight villagers who were fleeing. The Japanese army's shelling target was concentrated on the east gate of the city, and the losses inside the east gate were particularly heavy. The county government and the finance bureau were hit by many shells. Many women and children took refuge in the Women and Children Relief Institute. The French church in the city was bombed and destroyed, and nine out of ten houses in the streets were empty. No troops have been stationed in the city. Since 10:00 a.m. this morning, all gates in Tongxian County except the east gate have been wide open, but only residents are allowed to move out of the city, and entry into the city is strictly prohibited. Residents leaving the city are subject to strict inspection by the [unclear] army. (Special dispatch, 23rd)</p>

<p>Decision to Deal with it According to Established Policies</p>
<p>(Nanjing) On the morning of the 23rd, Wang Jingwei, Ye Chucang, Ju Zheng, Gu Mengyu, Zhu Peide, Luo Wengan, Chen Shaokuan, Wang Shijie, and others held an important meeting at the Central Political Committee to discuss how to deal with the situation. After reading telegrams from Huang Fu and He Yingqin, the officials were all very angry and decided to continue to deal with the situation calmly according to established policies. They immediately telegraphed Huang and He to this effect. After the meeting, a certain official told visiting reporters that the situation in Peiping and Tientsin had eased slightly today. The Japanese's aim of encircling Peiping and Tientsin is solely to force us to submit. The more we fear, the tighter they will press. Therefore, we must remain calm at this time and not panic and disrupt our steps. The government must find ways to protect Peiping and Tientsin to avoid expanding the situation, but it will not conclude a treaty of capitulation in order to protect Peiping and Tientsin, which would lead to the loss of the Northeast territory. However, it is difficult to say to what extent it can be protected. I hope that the people of the country will endure the pain for a while and wait for a turning point. (Special dispatch, 23rd)</p>

<h3 id="e20">The Transformation of the Situation in Beiping and Tianjin <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>The situation in Beiping and Tianjin has changed rapidly. The tense atmosphere of yesterday morning seems to have been swept away by the subsequent news of peace. This not only provides a basis for Huang Fu's ongoing efforts at reconciliation but is also a crucial turning point in the situation that has developed over the eleven months since the September 18th Incident, a situation that we could not have easily foreseen.</p>
<p>According to the statement Huang Fu made upon his initial arrival in Beiping on the 17th, he will first seek a mutually understood peaceful solution, but he will absolutely not compromise or seek peace with Japan. Observing the facts of the past week, we see that when our army was ordered to withdraw, the Japanese army pursued and attacked, forming a three-sided encirclement less than a hundred miles from Beiping and Tianjin. It goes without saying that they intend to coerce us into a treaty under duress. Furthermore, the tense atmosphere of yesterday morning and Japan's refusal to cease its aggressive actions are even more apparent. The military science explanation of war is "using armed force to make the other party submit to one's own will, and then continuing with political strategies." Since the Japanese army's attack from Fanyang, their occupation of our land, infringement of our sovereignty, and creation of a puppet organization in the Northeast can all be explained in this way. The recent actions of the Japanese army can also be explained in this way. Now, can Mr. Huang's reconciliation efforts cause Japan to make a considerable change in its military objectives while maintaining its statement of not compromising and not seeking peace? This is what the people of the country are most concerned about today.</p>
<p>What is the nature of the talks between the two sides under the mediation of British Ambassador Lampson? This is also extremely important. The hope expressed by those who support the reconciliation movement is for negotiations that do not involve political issues. In the history of our country in the past five years, there have been two successful instances of negotiating peace with the enemy: one was the Khabarovsk peace talks after the war with Russia in December of the 18th year of the Republic, and the other was the Shanghai ceasefire and troop withdrawal talks in May of last year. In the former, the Russian side had an urgent desire for resolution. The latter was triggered by an international relations incident, so there was superficially little damage to national sovereignty. Now, Mr. Huang's opponent is not comparable to Cai Yunsheng's opponent in those talks, and Mr. Huang's situation is a hundred times worse than that of Guo Taiqi last year. A slight deviation can lead to a major error. Since the September 18th Incident, the sacrifices and struggles of the military and civilians throughout the country, whether they will maintain their due effect, are closely related to this upcoming reconciliation talks. This is also something that the people of the country cannot ignore today.</p>
<p>This so-called reconciliation movement has been brewing for a long time since the government established the policy of "resisting on one hand and negotiating on the other" towards Japan. The public opinion has also done its part by stating the pros and cons, judging right and wrong, and expressing public opinion in advance. However, due to the trend of events, it is inevitable to take this path. For this, we believe that fervent statements are no longer timely, and discussing merits and demerits is also useless. The most important thing today is to concentrate the strength of the whole country and deal with the enemy, and not allow the situation created by this to become an obstacle to the future recovery of our territory.</p>
<p>Since last autumn, our diplomatic authorities have issued the following policies to the world regarding the Sino-Japanese incident: "1. China will absolutely not give up an inch of land or any part of its sovereignty due to the oppression of armed force. 2. It is absolutely impossible to agree to a solution based on the puppet organization in the Eastern Provinces created, maintained, and controlled by Japanese armed force. 3. A reasonable solution must be consistent with the words and spirit of the Covenant of the League of Nations, the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and the Nine-Power Treaty, and must also ensure China's sovereignty and consolidate permanent peace in the Far East." We believe that even if the reconciliation movement is necessary, it should not deviate from these three conditions in order to maintain our country's external credibility.</p>

<p>(Nanjing) According to foreign news, we have lodged a protest regarding Russia's sale of the Chinese Eastern Railway, but we have not yet received a reply. However, Russian Foreign Minister Litvinov verbally replied to Ambassador Yan, saying that the reply will be issued within days. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 23rd)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Since the news of Russia's sale of the Chinese Eastern Railway came out, Russian newspapers have not published a single word about the protest note we submitted. Public opinion has also been making unfavorable propaganda against us. Yesterday, the editor of the Russian Communist Party's organ, Pravda, wrote an editorial in response to our newspaper's comments on the Chinese Eastern Railway issue. The wording was very curt. Since the resumption of diplomatic relations between China and Russia, that country's newspapers have continued to attack our government and party headquarters arbitrarily, and even speak up for the Red bandits. This was slightly restrained after Ambassador Yan's representations, but that country's public opinion organs have lost their friendly attitude towards us. This is a serious misstep in observing the international situation. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 23rd)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) After the resumption of diplomatic relations between China and Russia, the government had a plan to establish a special trade bureau with Russia. Since Russia's sale of the Chinese Eastern Railway has affected the friendship and commerce between the two countries, and there are many obstacles in practice, the bureau has decided to suspend temporarily. In addition, the Ministry of Industry has also decided to temporarily not organize a Soviet Russian industrial investigation team due to the increasingly urgent national crisis and financial difficulties.

<h3 id="e23">Minister Song Expresses in the United States That China Will Never Give Up Manchuria and Rehe <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>Our government, even in a serious situation, maintains a stable financial position and will be able to repay all debts when it escapes the harm of Japanese aggression.</p>
<p>(New York) Chinese Finance Minister Song Ziwen delivered a speech at the American Council on Foreign Relations today, saying that Japan often claims that the situation in China is chaotic, which is actually inaccurate. Japan's statement is only used to cover up its aggressive behavior. In fact, the chaotic situation can only be seen in places where Japanese aggression or Japanese conspiracies have reached. Although the Chinese government is encountering major difficulties, its position is still solid. From February 1932 to March 1933, Japan attacked China again. Because it had to come out to resist, it would inevitably increase military spending, but its finances were still able to balance revenue and expenditure. And at a time when the world economy is declining and most governments are experiencing budget deficits, this achievement is quite commendable. What we should remember is that there are other things, such as the flood in 1931, the fall in the price of silver, and the decrease in credit after the Japanese invasion, all of which have increased the burden on the Chinese government, while the rich land of Manchuria, seized by Japan, and which we will never give up, has reduced China's income. As for the communists in Jiangxi Province, they cannot be wiped out as scheduled due to the Japanese invasion. All these things should be clear to friendly people. The Chinese government is dealing with difficulties by adopting three measures: (1) suspending construction projects, (2) adjusting domestic bonds and revising customs tariffs to increase tax revenue, and (3) continuing to make efforts to save military and administrative expenses. Minister Song also said that although the world is experiencing economic panic, Chinese bonds are still rising. Finally, he said that once China escapes Japanese aggression, eliminates the money spent on undeclared wars, and is able to restore prosperity, then China will be able to repay all its legitimate debts. (Havas dispatch from the 22nd)</p>
<p>(New York) Chinese Finance Minister Song Ziwen delivered a speech at a welcome banquet held by the China Association here tonight, hoping that the current meeting and the upcoming World Economic Conference will be able to reach an agreement to make war and aggression impossible in the future. He has not seen any signs of an early resolution to the dispute over Manchuria and Rehe, and expects that the war in North China will last for a long time, because the Chinese government will not dare to sign a treaty admitting the loss of territory. Therefore, Mr. Song also explained that Japan's victory was easy because China's financial resources were insufficient. Maintaining the central government is more important than buying weapons. He also said that although the Nanjing National Government has not placed every inch of land in the country under its management, except for the chaotic areas caused by Japanese aggression and conspiracies, the whole country is far from chaos. According to this speech, which is roughly the same as the speech given at noon and at the foreign affairs discussion, after the speech, the famous novelist Mrs. Buck praised Mr. Song's achievements in maintaining the financial stability of the Chinese government, and earnestly urged the American people to rise up together to oppose all aggression. Tonight, Chairman Cravath, Minister Shi Zhaoji, and Undersecretary of State Hung Puc were also present. Mr. Song is now scheduled to depart for London before the end of this week.

<p>The Tokyo government has decided on four principles to prepare for negotiations with the Russian ambassador.</p>
<p>(Tokyo) At today's regular cabinet meeting, Foreign Minister Uchida reported on the issue of purchasing the Chinese Eastern Railway. The policy decided upon after discussions between the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Military Affairs was generally decided upon as follows: (1) In the negotiations for the purchase of the Eastern Railway, encourage 'Manchukuo' to promise to negotiate the purchase. (2) In terms of the method of transfer, the Soviet Russian side will abandon the Eastern Railway to 'Manchukuo,' and 'Manchukuo' will pay the Soviet Russian government and people for their investment in the railway and their labor. (3) If the purchase involves political obligations regarding old debts and relations with other third countries, the Soviet Russian government will continue to bear them. (4) During the negotiations for the transfer, the price and method of payment will be decided by Russia and 'Manchukuo,' but if the two countries wish, the Japanese side will participate as a mediator. Foreign Minister Uchida will immediately summon the 'Manchukuo' Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, Ohashi, within the next day or two based on this policy, and propose Japan's principled attitude to open the way for a resolution. (Dentsu dispatch from the 23rd) (Tokyo) Although the Japanese government recognizes that the Soviet Union's right to manage the Chinese Eastern Railway is indisputable, it has doubts about the claim that the Soviet Union actually enjoys ownership. Therefore, according to the method temporarily decided this morning, 'Manchukuo' will negotiate with the Soviet Union to purchase the right to manage the Chinese Eastern Railway under Japanese guidance.

<p>(London) When the House of Commons met today, it discussed the case of Simpson, a reporter for the Harbin Daily, being ordered to be expelled by the 'Manchukuo' authorities. Prime Minister MacDonald stated that a British person can only be expelled from Chinese territory by a British court in accordance with the law. Simpson was not tried by a British court, but was ordered to be expelled by the 'Manchukuo' authorities, which is not in accordance with the law. Therefore, the British Consul General in Harbin has lodged a protest. He also said that the British government had instructed the Consul General to seriously protest the infringement of treaty rights, and had also instructed the British Chargé d'Affaires in Tokyo to ask the Japanese government to use its influence to prevent the 'Manchukuo' authorities from infringing treaty rights.

<h3 id="e51">The New Draft of the Four-Power Pact Has Been Sent by the Italian Government to Geneva. The American Representative Agrees to Sign It Immediately. <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>(London) Political circles in London have verified that the new draft of the Four-Power Pact proposed by Italian Prime Minister Mussolini has been agreed upon by the Italian government and the French and British ambassadors and Prussian Prime Minister Goering stationed in Rome. The original draft has been greatly changed. The new draft has been sent by the Italian government to Geneva. The British Foreign Secretary and the French and German Foreign Ministers will gather there within days to discuss it. Most believe that the signing of this pact depends on whether the American representative to the Disarmament Conference, Davis, agrees or not. (Reuters, 22nd) (Berlin) Political circles in Berlin earnestly stated that the talks in Rome have indeed given hope for the early conclusion of the Four-Power Pact, but these talks have not yet been completed. The ambassadors of the major powers concerned have been invited to the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs tonight to discuss unresolved issues. Although a compromise has been reached, it is only a draft and must now be discussed by the foreign affairs authorities of the major powers in Geneva. (Reuters, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to diplomatic sources, the situation in Europe has shown progress recently. The draft Four-Power Pact proposed by the Italian Prime Minister has been fully agreed upon and accepted by Britain, France, Germany, and Italy. This pact can guarantee the security of Europe. As for the Disarmament Conference, since Roosevelt made the application, it has broken the depressed situation. Recently, the American representative Davis made a strong statement on the peace application of the American President at the Disarmament Conference. The future trend of disarmament is likely to accept the recommendations of British Prime Minister MacDonald. Only after considerable success and internal unity in Europe can the situation in the Far East be dealt with. The US President's proposal to conclude a non-aggression pact can also be realized. Yesterday, members of the Labour Party in the British House of Commons questioned the government on whether it would continue to remain silent on Japan's invasion of China. MacDonald firmly denied it. From this, it can be seen that the Far East issue will not be ignored by the European authorities. (Central News Agency, 23rd)</p>

<p>(Paris) The Four-Power Pact of Britain, France, Germany, and Italy has been revised, and all points have been agreed upon. However, Articles 2 and 3 of the five preambles have not been completely finalized. The basis of this agreement is the Covenant of the League of Nations, the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and the Locarno Treaty. Article 1 stipulates that all matters must be done within the structure of the League of Nations. The four countries must work together within this structure to organize peace. Article 2 speaks of Germany's demands for equality, emphasizes Articles 10 and 9 of the Covenant of the League of Nations, and reiterates the declaration of December 10. Article 3 emphasizes the necessity of the four countries adopting a common policy within the possible scope. Article 4 states the effective period of this pact, approximately ten years. Article 5 stipulates that this pact must be approved by the League of Nations. (Reuters, 23rd)</p>

<p>Diverse Reactions from Various Countries; British Press Sees a Change in Traditional U.S. Policy</p>
<p>French Press Says the Guarantees Provided by Davis are Inadequate; Germans Claim Germany's Equal Rights are Already Established</p>
<p>U.S. Press Points to Further Recommendations from Roosevelt</p>
<p>(London) The British press today welcomes the remarks of the U.S. representative, Davis, in</p>
<p>Geneva, considering them a practical explanation and supplement to President Roosevelt's declaration, indicating to some extent that the United States has abandoned neutrality. The Times comments on the change in the traditional U.S. policy regarding neutrality and freedom of the seas, stating that this is a crucial moment and a great success has already been achieved. It anticipates that international control of armaments will soon be victorious. The Daily Telegraph calls Davis's announcement a reassurance, and the Daily Express says it is a promise by the United States to support the League of Nations in implementing sanctions under the League Covenant. The Westminster Gazette says that events have moved a step further, with the United States formally promising to actively safeguard world peace. The Daily Mail points to this as another indication of U.S. readiness to participate in peacekeeping efforts. The least enthusiastic among the British newspapers are the Morning Post and the Daily Sketch. The Morning Post says that what Davis has agreed to is, at most, a slight nod of approval to those who are in the right. The Daily Sketch says that to claim that the U.S. proposal can bring peace closer is simply deceiving people. (Reuters, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Dr. Wiesenburg, who recently served as Hitler's</p>
<p>special envoy to England, published an article in a German newspaper today praising U.S. representative Davis, saying that Davis has made the world understand the essence of Germany's position: that disarmament is the path to peace, and that Germany's equal rights have been effectively established. The German press's criticism of Davis's speech in Geneva yesterday is generally similar in tone. (Reuters, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Paris) Most French newspapers do not criticize U.S.</p>
<p>representative Davis's speech in Geneva yesterday. The general consensus is that France will not abandon substance for illusion, and will not reduce armaments until France has sufficient guarantees. The guarantees given by Davis are still inadequate. (Reuters, 23rd)</p>
<p>(New York) U.S. public opinion's criticism of Davis's</p>
<p>Geneva speech points to a step beyond President Roosevelt's recommendations. The New York Times says that the U.S. attitude has now changed publicly, as it now advances and retreats with the world, and can no longer pride itself on being uninvolved. Washington dispatches in various New York newspapers all say that Davis's remarks indicate that the U.S. is now abandoning its traditional policy of neutrality and freedom of the seas. (Reuters, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Washington) Democratic leader Senator Lewis, who has</p>
<p>long opposed U.S. involvement in European disputes, now fully supports Davis's statements in Geneva today. Secretary of State Hull hopes that Davis's remarks will lead to the early success of the disarmament conference, but hopes that the United States will retain its freedom of decision.

<p>Minor Setback at Disarmament Conference</p>
<p>Five-Power Meeting Decides on Procedures</p>
<p>(Geneva) When the meeting opened today, the U.S. representative spoke first in a good</p>
<p>atmosphere (his speech was in last night's translation). The British Foreign Secretary followed, expressing the British government's gratitude for Davis's support of disarmament, and saying that he was also grateful for the Italian government's continued support. The British plan was not without its shortcomings, but President Roosevelt's declaration and the German government's statement had completely changed the outlook. The German representative Natolini's remarks that Germany could abolish its armaments, etc., convinced him that detailed discussion of the articles could now begin, and each item could now be put to consideration. French Foreign Minister Poncet took an uncommitted attitude towards the details of the British proposal, as the French government only accepted the British proposal in principle. Poncet declared that the time had come to discuss the political and technical aspects of the disarmament problem, and therefore suggested first discussing the first section of the British draft, especially the issue of regional agreements. The chairman agreed, but U.S. representative Davis opposed this suggestion. (Reuters, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Geneva) A surprising development occurred as the Disarmament Conference's General Committee meeting was coming to</p>
<p>an end, which was quite enough to destroy the harmonious impression created by the previous speeches. After Chairman Henderson agreed that the first section of the British draft would be the starting point for discussion, U.S. representative Davis asked for reconsideration of this procedure, saying that after he had explained the U.S. attitude, it seemed unnecessary to waste time discussing the first section, as the issue of security was more appropriately discussed directly by the countries concerned. This attitude of the U.S. representative was not approved by the French side. France believed that the U.S. representative's insistence was an attempt to force France to be satisfied with the U.S.'s vague and uncertain promise to participate in consultations. Seeing this sudden change, the chairman announced that the General Committee would adjourn until the afternoon of the next day. (Reuters, 22nd) (Geneva) Immediately after the adjournment, Poncet and Davis privately</p>
<p>agreed that the Disarmament General Committee would first begin discussing the Security Convention tomorrow, while private talks would be held on the issue of arms reduction. (National Telegram, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Geneva) After the Disarmament Committee meeting adjourned unhappily today,</p>
<p>it is now scheduled that a meeting of the five major powers of Britain, France, Italy, Germany, and the United States will be held at 11:00 tomorrow morning, at which efforts will be made to agree on the procedures, and then a meeting of the main group will be held to decide on the agenda for the General Committee meeting tomorrow afternoon. (Reuters, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The representatives of the five countries, the United States, Germany, Britain, France, and Italy, met at the residence of the chairman of the Disarmament Conference, Henderson, from 10:00 to 12:00 this morning, to decide whether the General Committee should discuss the security issue or the arms issue this afternoon. The debate was quite intense when the representatives of the five countries met. French Foreign Minister Poncet defended France's position, arguing that the arms</p>
<p>reduction that France could commit to depended on mutual security guarantees among countries and international supervision of armaments. Therefore, it was reasonable to start with the security issue. However, most of the representatives requested that the disarmament issue be resolved first. Subsequently, a resolution was passed, declaring that the General Committee should discuss both the disarmament and security issues at the same time, and that no vote should be held on any item before the British plan had its first reading, so that all issues could be considered.

<p>(Hangzhou) New cocoons from various places in Zhejiang have come on the market, but very few</p>
<p>cocoon brokers have opened their scales, making it difficult for cocoon farmers to sell. Currently, the highest market price for local cocoons is 25 cents per catty, and improved varieties are 35 cents. It is found that local varieties were still sold for 55 cents in 1919 and 40 cents in 1920. The above cocoon prices have fallen year by year, and are now at their lowest. The rural economy is feared to decline further. Currently, the Xiaoshan and Lin'an sericulture model areas have been organized by the Construction Department to form cocoon purchasing committees, raising 700,000 to start purchasing improved cocoons to promote and relieve the situation.

<h3 id="e80">Factionalism Gradually Arises Within Japanese Military Leader Araki's Group <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>Masaki Resigns After the Grand Maneuvers; Araki Advocates Simultaneous Invasion of China and Russia</p>
<p>China United Press, Tokyo, 23rd - According to news obtained by this agency's special</p>
<p>correspondent, there have recently been some definite changes in the power dynamics within the Japanese military. Factionalism is gradually arising within Araki's group as well. It is said that the main reason for this is the procedures that should be taken in the future regarding the continental policy after the establishment of "Manchukuo." The views are divided into two types: one is "re-advancing when an opportunity arises," and the other is "advancing at the opportunity." The former is the view of Vice Chief of Staff Masaki, and the latter is the policy of the Kwantung Army. Araki himself leans towards the advancement theory, the details of which are described as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The "Re-Advancement" Advocates Only Eastern Four Provinces, Temporarily Stop</p>
<p>Military Actions, Organize Internal Affairs and Economic Construction in the Eastern Four Provinces. Domestic economic power may not be able to support further expansion of military actions with current domestic economic power. If supplies are cut off, then previous efforts will be in vain. Napoleon and Alexander both failed because they knew how to advance but not how to defend. To build the Eastern Four Provinces, at least ten years of painstaking effort are needed, and international tolerance also has a certain limit. Since ancient times, there have been few who have offended public anger and achieved satisfactory results. Stopping military action and seeking the world's understanding is the right time. The unfinished part of the continental policy can "re-advance when an opportunity arises" in the future. Therefore, this faction is called the "Re-Advancement Theory." Lieutenant General Masaki (Vice Chief of Staff), from Araki's group, is its representative. Ugaki and others mostly support this view. This faction not only does not approve of invading Russia's Maritime Province, but also does not want to invade Pingjin, causing larger-scale resistance. (2) The "Advancement" Advocates Seize This Opportunity, as Russia is Busy with the Second Five-Year Plan, and its military preparations are incomplete. China's internal affairs are not unified, and Europe is in a crisis. While Britain and the United States are taking care of themselves, seize the opportunity to advance again and again, occupying Russia's Maritime Province to the north, seizing North China to the south, and attacking Chahar and Suiyuan to the west. Such a good opportunity given by God, if you don't find a way to use it, when are you waiting for? Invading China only requires 100,000 troops. Collect as many of the Chinese troops who oppose the Central Government as possible to be the vanguard. There is nothing to worry about in the war. The current strength of the Japanese army is enough to defeat the Red Army. As for international issues, it is already isolated in the front, so why fear the back? Therefore, the China Eastern Railway is already under the control of the Japanese army. Why bother negotiating with Russia to buy it back? It can also be considered a great favor to Russia if Japan does not take the opportunity to seize its Maritime Province. Regarding China, we should seize the opportunity to advance until China is disarmed. The representative of this faction is the Kwantung Army, the North China Garrison Army, and the generals in the Army Ministry of the Araki line. The failure of the Seiyukai cabinet and the still bleak prospects for peace in North China are caused by this faction's activities inside and outside. The dispute between the two factions is becoming increasingly fierce. It is reported that Vice Chief of Staff Masaki will therefore be forced to step down. The talk that Lieutenant General Masaki will be promoted to general and resign from his current position after the Grand Maneuvers in August is all an atmosphere created by Araki's direct officers.</p>
<h3 id="e81">After Finance Minister Takahashi Decided to Remain, Saito Issued a Proclamation <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>Stabilizing Domestic Sentiment</p>
<p>Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 23rd - Prime Minister Saito, in order</p>
<p>to stabilize the situation, issued the following statement today: "After mature discussions with Finance Minister Takahashi on the 'political situation' issue, Finance Minister Takahashi is willing to continue to dedicate his old body to the country and move forward to overcome difficulties. The current cabinet, in accordance with the decided policy, will work hard on 'Manchukuo,' properly handle relations with China and Russia, and move forward on the path of shaking off the aftermath and refreshing diplomacy, in order to live up to the spirit of the imperial rescript."</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 23rd - Thanks to the Finance Minister's remaining, the political situation has been able to stabilize a little. However, the Finance Minister's decision to withdraw his resignation was not voluntary, but was forced by the surrounding circumstances. Therefore, the atmosphere of the Seiyukai is not to use the Finance Minister's resignation as a tool to overthrow the cabinet, and if the surrounding circumstances are eased, he may ask to resign again. Therefore, it is still questionable whether the Finance Minister has the determination to compile the budget for the next year and attend the parliament. However, since the government knows that the Finance Minister's remaining has been confirmed, it will definitely announce the stabilization of the political situation to the people, and from now on, it will focus its efforts on the implementation of policies.</p>

After Hitler's speech, the fleet sailed to the exercise site, and the main warships of the German Navy all participated.</p>

<p>Doctors Marvel at the Inconceivable</p>
<p>Reuters, Pune, 22nd - Gandhi has been fasting for three weeks since May 8th.</p>
<p>Two weeks have now passed. Although his body is very weak, his spirit is still good. His doctors are very surprised, saying that it is almost inconceivable that a person who has been fasting for two weeks can still be so well. It is reported that Gandhi also made a "fast to death" for the sake of the untouchables last September, but after a week, he took nourishment due to the agreement to improve the status of the untouchables. At that time, his body was extremely weak, and the doctors believed that if he fasted for a few more days, his life would be in danger. This time, many devout believers gathered around him, and the famous speaker and poet Mrs. Naidu was also among them.</p>

<p>Hu Shize Claims: China is Trying to Eliminate Drug Manufacturing; British Representative Opposes Sending Representatives to the Far East</p>
<p>Havas News Agency, Geneva, 23rd - The International</p>
<p>League of Nations Narcotics Advisory Committee, due to the review of China's annual report on narcotics sales and consumption, caused a debate. The Chinese representative Hu Shize declared that the narcotics problem is currently extremely serious. The reason is that certain provinces in China are invaded by foreigners, so the narcotics problem is no longer the main problem that the national government pays attention to. It is now believed that international narcotics smugglers have established sales and manufacturing organizations in central China. China is now trying to eliminate the manufacture of opium products. The Italian representative then spoke, saying that the newly established narcotics manufacturing plant in the Yunnan Province bordering China is very dangerous. French representative Bourgeois suggested setting up a subcommittee to study the narcotics problem and awaken public opinion. The Polish representative suggested that a League of Nations representative be sent to Singapore to handle the narcotics sales problem in the Far East, especially China. This suggestion was opposed by British representative Dale. Someone else advocated that the League of Nations or the Chinese government investigate the situation of narcotics sales in China.</p>

<p>(II) Many Scars of War Seen on the Tianjin-Jinan Train</p>
<p>Outside Tianjin, enemy troops pressed the border; inside, Chinese traitors lurked. Just when rumors were rampant and people were in a state of panic, the northward trip of Mr. Huang Fu brought a breath of relief, reflecting a sense of hope as the clouds seemed to dissipate. However, as Tianjin is close to the coast and located at the intersection of the Beining and Jinpu Railways, the Japanese in North China have been eyeing it covetously, eager to seize it as a base for their operations. Moreover, the Japanese concession, with its garrisoned troops, serves as a breeding ground for all sorts of malfeasance. Consequently, disgruntled warlords, disgraced politicians, and local ruffians, all colluding with the Japanese, are constantly plotting, posing a threat like a thorn in one's side and a worry in one's heart. As the Sino-Japanese problem has evolved to this point, Japan is unwilling to relinquish the Eastern Provinces, and our country cannot sacrifice its territory. Their encirclement and threat to Pingjin (Beiping and Tianjin) is effectively an attempt to force a treaty at the city gates, to acknowledge all their rights and interests in the invasion of Manchuria, which has become a reality. In this kind of situation, akin to riding a tiger, it seems unlikely that Mr. Huang can create a new situation in just two or three days, as if a chronic disease were to meet a miraculous doctor and be cured instantly. On the other hand, there are widespread rumors that the situation will take a surprising turn for the better, with much discussion but no consensus. Due to the rushed schedule, I was unable to stay and quietly observe the events in order to provide readers with a clear and comprehensive report, which I regret deeply. Having decided to return south, I hurried to the Jinpu Railway Station. When the ordinary train arrived, a prisoner was led off the train. He was fat-headed, big-brained, and of impressive build. Following him was a limping wounded soldier, using a crutch for support, cursing and hitting him as he went. When asked what had happened, the answer was that the prisoner was a Chinese traitor who, out of guilt, had behaved suspiciously, leading to interrogation by the police, who found a letter addressed "Respectfully presented to Commander Nakamura." The entire train's passengers kicked and beat him, bringing him close to death. Unexpectedly, once they were off the train, he seemed as energetic as ever. It is said that these heartless Chinese traitors and those who act as accomplices to the enemy receive extremely harsh treatment, earning only forty cents a day and subjected to various restrictions. As soon as a riot order is issued, they are sent to their deaths, yet they only receive one dollar a day. For such a paltry sum, they are willing to sacrifice their lives and harm the country. There is nothing more lamentable than this. The crowding on the train was no less than that on the refugee trains from Beining and Xikai. However, those trains were mostly filled with poor people, while this one had many wealthy merchants and gentry, along with their jewel-bedecked families. This could be seen from the ticket office's announcement that first and second-class tickets were sold out. As the train passed through the main station and the new station (still in Tianjin), many passengers boarded through the windows, struggling to stand upright in the crowd. After several hours of travel, as deep night fell, those who were sitting or lying down snored loudly, while most of those standing were half-asleep, swaying and bumping into each other, leading to occasional arguments. Children, startled awake from their dreams, mumbled to themselves or even kicked, shouted, and cursed, creating a spectacle for the journey. Several people forcibly got off the train, only to realize they had gotten off at the wrong stop. They shouted and got back on, causing the entire train to laugh and startling everyone awake. One energetic man, over forty, said loudly, "The state of China is truly heartbreaking. Years ago, when I traveled from Ping to Jing (Beijing), I sat in a first-class compartment, and my two attendants were also somehow given compartments by the railway bureau. I was shocked, unable to pay such a large fee, but the ticket inspector explained, 'We are under orders to welcome the director' (it is unknown what rank of director the speaker was). 'Please don't be polite; in any case, most of the compartments are empty, and your attendants need not move elsewhere.' From this, you can see how eager the officials are to ingratiate themselves. In my youth, I worked hard to enter the military and political circles, but now I am fortunate to have escaped, though I am scarred and do not want to look back." At that moment, a young woman, reportedly a student from Peking University, struggled to squeeze back to her seat from the toilet, indignant, saying, "There are two villagers squatting on the urine-soaked floor of the toilet. I heard that since the Northeast Incident, they fled from Shenyang to Tangshan to work, but now, because Tangshan has been abandoned, they plan to flee back to their hometown in Shandong. One of them is already sick from the horrors of war and is too weak. So, they are both crammed into the toilet, crying quietly in each other's arms. Although I wanted to advise them not to stay in such an unsanitary place, there was no way to accommodate them on the seats. Some people were sprawled out, occupying the seats of two or three people. When I tried to ask them to give up a seat, they just glared at me. It is lamentable how little empathy the people of this country have." The young woman then saw a baby sleeping soundly on a suitcase, laughing in his sleep. She smiled bitterly, saying, "A baby not even a year old is forced to flee on this bumpy train. I doubt his dreams are good; why is he laughing so heartily?" An old woman sighed in response, "My third grandson looked just like this child. Now, he and his older siblings have become spirits, buried together in a dugout under enemy bombs." As she spoke, tears streamed down her face. When asked, she revealed that she was from Miyun. One morning, enemy planes arrived, and her children and grandchildren rushed into a dugout, where a bomb fell and sealed them inside. Explosions continued nearby, preventing anyone from digging them out, and they all suffocated. She had not yet gotten out of bed and was too terrified to move, which is how she survived. Alone and helpless, she was fleeing to Qufu to seek refuge with relatives. When they arrived in Jinan, passengers got off one after another in large numbers. The reporter took the opportunity to visit Chairman Han but then also got off the train. (19th)</p>
<h3 id="e88">Judgment of the Jiangsu High Court in the Case of Chen Duxiu (Continued) <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>(II) Regarding Wang Wu, namely Song Fengchun, and Pu Yifan:</p>
<p>Defendant Pu Yifan repeatedly denied joining the Communist Party and being elected as an alternate member of the Central Committee of the CCP Opposition. Wang Wu also only admitted to joining the Communist Party in the past and being sentenced to six years' imprisonment by the Shanghai Provisional Military Tribunal in 1931. As for being released on bail during his sentence, re-appointed as an alternate member of the Central Committee of the CCP Opposition, and attending CCP meetings, he denied all of this. However, investigations revealed that the defendants all attended the weekly meetings at the home of co-conspirator Xie Shaoshan and were apprehended along with Peng Shuzhi, Xie Shaoshan, and Wang Zhaoqun. According to Xie Shaoshan's statement to the Shanghai Public Concession Police, "My place is often used for meetings. The standing committee includes five members: Chen Duxiu, Peng Shuzhi, Pu Yifan (namely Bu Dezi), and Luo Shifan and Song Fengchun. The last person was just released from Caohejing Prison and this is the first time they attended a meeting. On the day we were arrested, they were only holding the weekly meeting" (see statement of the Public Concession Police, October 16, 1932). Later, when they were escorted to the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court, the judge asked, "What kind of organization is your place?" and the answer was, "Our place is an organization led by Trotsky." Asked, "Where do you hold your meetings?" The answer was, "Every Saturday at my house." Asked, "What is Peng Shuzhi's position?" Answer, "He is a standing committee member."</p>
<p>Asked, "What about Pu Yifan and Wang Wu?" Answer, "They are also standing committee members." Asked how many standing committee members there were in total, the answer was "Five in total, all of whom have been apprehended." However, Chen Duxiu is the chairman of the standing committee, Wang Wu only attended for the first time, and I am the secretary of the standing committee" (see minutes of the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court, October 17, 1932). The prosecutor of this court interrogated Chen Duxiu, who stated that there were three members of the standing committee, himself, Peng Shuzhi, and Zhang Jiu, and the first alternate member was Pu Yifan, and another was either Luo Shifan or Song Fengchun, he couldn't remember clearly. Peng Shuzhi was then interrogated, who also stated that there were three standing committee members, himself, Chen Duxiu, and Zhang Jiu, and the alternate members were Pu Yifan and Song Fengchun (see minutes of the Prosecutor's Office of this court, December 6, 1932). Furthermore, many reactionary documents were found in Pu Yifan's residence at No. 320, Gaofu Lane, Rue Sainte Marie. Song Fengchun had already been expelled from the Third International for his Trotskyist leanings. This time, he was apprehended with Peng Shuzhi at Xie Shaoshan's house. The evidence against him is clear, and there is no room for denial. Although Chen Duxiu and Peng Shuzhi, during the trial in this court, Pu Yifan argued that the alternate standing committee member mentioned earlier at the prosecutor's office was Pu Yifang, not Pu Yifan, and that Pu Yifang's age, appearance, and origin were different from the Pu Yifan who was apprehended. Peng Shuzhi also argued on behalf of Song Fengchun that he had not been released from prison for long and could not have been elected as an alternate standing committee member. The defendants also relied on this counter-evidence to defend themselves. The investigation revealed that Pu Yifang and Pu Yifan have similar pronunciations, but there must first be sufficient evidence to prove that there is another person named Pu Yifang, then the Pu Yifan who is on trial is not an alternate standing committee member, which would be clear even without defense. However, Chen Duxiu and others could not provide evidence that Pu Yifang actually existed, and only because the previous statements were on record, there was no way to deny it and they used the similar sound of the name as a cover. This kind of empty talk is difficult to hide, and only makes the crime more obvious. As for Song Fengchun, although he had not been released from prison for long, Xie Shaoshan's initial statement stated that the last person had just been released from Caohejing Prison and this was the first time they attended a meeting, which is consistent with the facts and with the initial statements of Chen Duxiu and others. Although Xie Shaoshan was not directly questioned by this court, her statements were recorded in the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court and the Public Concession Police Station and can be adopted. As for the defendants' claim that there should be records and a sign-in book for the meetings, the CCP's secret meetings are different from ordinary public meetings and naturally cannot be complete. Moreover, the co-conspirator Xie Shaoshan, who participated in the meeting, testified clearly, so there is no doubt. There is no reason to rely on this as a defense. The above evidence shows that the defendants organized groups and held meetings with the aim of endangering the Republic of China, and the facts are very clear. However, if an alternate standing committee member's actions within the group cannot be proven to have a common intention, they should not be held responsible for other joint crimes.</p>
<p>(III) Regarding Wang Ziping and He Afang:</p>
<p>Defendant Wang Ziping, also known as Zeng Meng, was introduced by his friend Qin Dingyu in 1927 to work as a proofreader at the Chongwentang Printing Press on Jiangwan Road in Shanghai. Later, he was persuaded by Hao Qianzhi, the deputy manager of Chongwentang, to join the Communist Party. Defendant He Afang also joined the Communist Party in February of the same year through an introduction by his friend Jin Muhan, namely Jin Shisheng, and served as a messenger, receiving a monthly salary of twenty yuan. Later, both were expelled from the Third International for opposing the Stalinist faction and joined the CCP Opposition organized by Chen Duxiu and others, and jointly undertook copywriting and printing work within the party. The defendants have repeatedly stated this in their statements. When they were arrested, they were printing "Campus Life" and "Spark" at their residence at No. 335, Yeguang Lane, Tangshan Road. The investigators and the evidence were seized on the spot, so the facts of the crime are very certain. The words propagated in "Campus Life," "Spark," and other publications and leaflets not only fall within the scope of communism but have reached the level of treason. The reasons for this have been explained in detail in the section on Chen Duxiu and Peng Shuzhi. The defendants are members of the CCP Opposition and knew that the documents were used to propagate treason, yet they undertook to print them, so they must bear the responsibility for helping to propagate them, without saying more. However, the defendants were forced by livelihood to seek printing wages. Considering the nature of the crime, they deserve leniency and should be given a reduced sentence.</p>
<p>(IV) Regarding Wang Zhaoqun and Guo Jinghao:</p>
<p>Defendants Wang Zhaoqun and Guo Jinghao have repeatedly denied participating in the CCP Opposition, but Wang Zhaoqun was captured with Peng Shuzhi, Wang Wu, Pu Yifan, Xie Shaoshan, etc., at the home of co-conspirator Xie Shaoshan, and was apprehended while attending the weekly meeting. Xie Shaoshan testified to this, and Xie Shaoshan's house was a secret meeting place for the CCP Opposition, and those who participated in the meetings, such as Peng Shuzhi, Wang Wu, Pu Yifan, etc., were all important people in the organization. If the defendant was not a party member, why would Xie Shaoshan allow him to reside at her residence? Furthermore, Lu Yuanhu, the inspector of the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau who cracked the case, stated that Wang Zhaoqun's name was listed as Luo Shifan in the list of CCP members, and that Luo Shifan was a member of the Central Committee of the CCP Opposition. However, Chen Duxiu and Peng Shuzhi insisted that Luo Shifan was another person and not Wang Zhaoqun, and that there were only three members of the standing committee, besides the two of them and Zhang Jiu. After reviewing Xie Shaoshan's statements made during the interrogation by the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court and the Public Concession Police Station, there was no mention of Wang Zhaoqun being Luo Shifan. The list was copied from another list, so it cannot be used as a basis for determining the facts. Although it cannot be proven that Wang Zhaoqun was a member of the standing committee, there is no doubt that he was a member of the CCP Opposition organization as he attended the weekly meetings. Defendant Guo Jinghao, originally named Peng Daozhi, is the brother of Peng Shuzhi and was arrested by the police at Wang Ziping's printing press. Furthermore, the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau seized a school registration form, namely a CCP registration form, which stated that Peng Daozhi joined a group in Changsha, Hunan in September 1925 (1915), and later withdrew informally. In December 1929 (1918), he rejoined the opposition in Shanghai and served as a district committee member and student movement organizer in the Hudong district. He is now in charge of organizational work and student movements in the Huxi district student branch, registered on June 8, 1932. There is also a note "alias Guo Jinghao." Although the words Guo Jinghao have been crossed out, they are still legible, so there is considerable evidence that the defendant joined the CCP Opposition group. However, the defendant is young and ignorant and was lured by his brother Peng Shuzhi, which led to him being caught in the net of the law. The circumstances are excusable, and a reduced sentence should be given.</p>
<p>(V) Regarding Liang Youguang and Wang Jiantang:</p>
<p>The main point of the indictment regarding the defendants' alleged crimes is that their names match the names listed in the CCP communications addresses found at Xie Shaoshan's house, and that many reactionary books were also found in their possession. Furthermore, the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau indicated that Liang Youguang was a provincial inspector of the Chen Duxiu faction. This court reviewed the files of the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court, which stated that the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau indicated that the defendants were arrested based on the small slips of paper with communication addresses found at Xie Shaoshan's house. However, Lu Yuanhu, the clerk of the bureau who cracked the case, was ordered to appear in court, and testified that there was only one slip of paper found at Xie Shaoshan's house, on which a "Chen" character was written, which was Chen Duxiu's address. There were no other slips of paper with communication addresses, and the defendants were arrested based on Xie Shaoshan's verbal instructions. Therefore, the basis for the defendants' arrest is questionable. Furthermore, this court sent a letter to the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau to inquire about Liang Youguang being a provincial inspector of the Chen Duxiu faction, and they replied that, according to the confession of a self-surrendered person, Xie Shaoshan, the small room at No. 1044 Dongsiwen Lane, Xinzha Road, was the address of Luo Shifan. Luo was the person in charge of organization for the Chen Duxiu faction, so personnel in charge of work in other areas often came to Shanghai to contact Luo and sometimes stayed there. However, Liang Youguang had only been in Shanghai for a short time and had not yet formally met in the organizational relationship. Although the details are not known, he should be a person in charge of work in other areas. Therefore, according to Xie Shaoshan's statement, it was only a conjecture, which is difficult to adopt as a basis. Furthermore, No. 1044 Dongsiwen Lane, Xinzha Road, where Liang Youguang lived, was Luo Shifan's address. Therefore, the name that Xie Shaoshan instructed to arrest at that time should be Luo Shifan, not Liang Youguang, which further proves that the seized books were Luo Shifan's belongings, not Liang Youguang's. Therefore, there is no proof regarding Liang Youguang's criminal acts. As for Liang Youguang's panic and jumping out of the window when the police came to arrest him at night, this alone is difficult to directly indicate that he participated in the Communist Party. Defendant Wang Jiantang stated that he lived at No. 22 Fululi Road and there was more than one family in the house. He was the second landlord, and the books were found in the room of Wang Boping, a tenant in the front building. Because Wang Boping was not in the house, he was brought to the case. It is unclear whether Xie Shaoshan's verbal instructions at the time specifically mentioned Wang Jiantang or Wang Boping. When this court questioned Lu Yuanhu, he stated that he did not remember clearly because it had been a long time. Furthermore, there were eight boxes of documents seized in this case, some related to the study of communism and some unrelated to communism. The ten types of books seized in the house were all mixed with those seized elsewhere when the police sent the case, and the documents did not separately indicate which books came from which location. Therefore, even if the books are considered to belong to Wang Jiantang, it is impossible to prove whether they are books for studying communism, so it is difficult to use this as the only evidence of his joining the Communist Party.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the defendants Chen Duxiu and Peng Shuzhi organized groups with the aim of endangering the Republic of China and used words to propagate treason, thereby committing the crimes in Article 2, Paragraph 2, and Article 6 of the Emergency Law for the Punishment of Crimes Endangering the Republic of China. In accordance with Article 10 of the same law, Article 42 and Article 74 of the Criminal Law, and Article 2, Paragraph 2 of the Emergency Law for the Punishment of Crimes Endangering the Republic of China, and Article 77 of the Criminal Law, they are sentenced to thirteen years of imprisonment and deprived of public rights for fifteen years in accordance with Article 106, Article 56, and Article 57, Paragraph 4 of the Criminal Law. Wang Ziping and He Afang organized groups with the aim of endangering the Republic of China and helped to propagate treason by means of words, in accordance with Article 10 of the Emergency Law for the Punishment of Crimes Endangering the Republic of China, Article 6 and Article 2, Paragraph 2 of the same law, Article 74, Article 44, Paragraph 1, Paragraph 3, First Section, Article 77, Article 78, and Article 87 of the Criminal Law, they are sentenced to five years of imprisonment, with a slight reduction, and deprived of public rights for seven years in accordance with Article 106, Article 56, and Article 57, Paragraph 5 of the Criminal Law. Wang Wu (namely Song Fengchun), Pu Yifan, Wang Zhaoqun, and Guo Jinghao organized groups with the aim of endangering the Republic of China, thereby committing the crime in Article 6 of the Emergency Law for the Punishment of Crimes Endangering the Republic of China. Wang Wu (namely Song Fengchun), Pu Yifan, and Wang Zhaoqun are each sentenced to five years of imprisonment, and Guo Jinghao is sentenced to two years and six months of imprisonment in accordance with Article 10 of the Emergency Law for the Punishment of Crimes Endangering the Republic of China and Article 77 of the Criminal Law. Wang Wu, Pu Yifan, and Wang Zhaoqun are each deprived of public rights for seven years, and Guo Jinghao is deprived of public rights for three years, in accordance with Article 106, Article 56, and Article 57, Paragraph 5 of the Criminal Law. The number of days in detention before the judgment is final shall be commuted at a rate of two days of detention for one day of imprisonment in accordance with Article 64 of the Criminal Law. The documents and prohibited books (as per the list in the case file) used for the commission of the crime or in preparation for the crime shall be confiscated in accordance with Article 62, Paragraphs 1 and 2 of the Criminal Law. The criminal suspicion of Liang Youguang and Wang Jiantang cannot be proven, and they are found not guilty in accordance with Article 316 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The judgment is rendered specifically as stated in the main text.</p>
<p>This case was prosecuted in court by Zhu Jun, the prosecutor of this court, acting in the capacity of prosecutor. The court of appeal for this case is the Supreme Court. If any party is dissatisfied with this judgment, they shall file an appeal with this court within ten days from the day following the delivery of the judgment, in a written statement stating the reasons for dissatisfaction.

<p>Liu Xiang Takes the Opportunity to Deploy Troops to Unify the Sichuan Situation</p>
<p>Chongqing dispatch: After the conflict between Liu and Deng, the entire Sichuan Province has fallen into a state of civil war. Currently, both sides are engaged in fierce battles in Pixian, Xindu, Xinfan, Guanxian, Chongning, and other places. The people are suffering and suffering heavy losses. The latest situation is reported as follows:</p>
<p>The 24th Army Launches a Four-Pronged Attack</p>
<p>At the beginning of the war, Liu Wenhui of the 24th Army immediately appointed Zhang Qingping, the commander of the 1st Division of the army, as the commander of the first route; Leng Nanxun, the commander of the 2nd Division of the Sichuan-Kang Army, as the commander of the second route; Lin Yungen, the commander of the 2nd Division, as the commander of the third route; and Chen Hongwen of the Sichuan-Kang 2nd Division as the commander of the fourth route. Each commander led 12 regiments of men to attack the 28th Army. The allocation of their front lines was as follows: the first route advanced towards Pengxian, Chongning, and Guanxian; the second route advanced towards Pixian and Xinfan; the third route advanced towards Xindu and Jintang; and the fourth route advanced towards Ziyang, Jianyang, and Lezhi. The focus of the battle was on the Pixian and Guanxian areas. On the 13th, the first route launched its attack, and Zhang Qingping's troops engaged in fierce battles with Huang Yin's troops of the 28th Army in Pixian, Guanxian, Chongning, and other places. There was no significant progress on either side. On the 17th, Chen Hongwen's troops of the 24th Army's fourth route advanced towards Ziyang and made contact with Chen Shunong of the 3rd Division of the 28th Army. Chen was unable to resist and retreated step by step. Ziyang was occupied by the 24th Army. Jianyang also fell into the hands of the 24th Army on the 18th. The three counties of Pi, Chong, and Guan were also captured by the 24th Army. During the attack on Pixian on the 18th, fierce battles broke out on both sides, with each side deploying thousands of men to serve as suicide squads, engaging in hand-to-hand combat. In this battle, Zhou Chongsheng, the regimental commander of the 24th Army, was killed in action, and Mao, the regimental commander, and Shi Zhaowu, the brigade commander, were seriously wounded. More than a thousand people died on each side, demonstrating the intensity of the battle. Furthermore, when the 24th Army attacked Chongning on the 17th, fierce battles raged for two days and nights, with more than ten hand-to-hand combats. Zhou Xianpei, the regimental commander of Huang Yin's unit of the 28th Army, was killed in action, and Huang Jianming, the magistrate, was also killed in action. More than 500 houses of residents near Chongcheng were burned, and more than 1,000 people were killed by stray bullets or burned to death. On the 18th, Huang's unit collapsed, and the 24th Army entered the city on the 19th. In the Guanxian area, due to the dangerous terrain and the obstruction of the river, the two sides were deadlocked for seven days, each suffering more than 2,000 casualties. It was not until the 20th that Guanxian was captured by the 24th Army. Currently, the main force is advancing towards Xinfan, Xindu, Jintang, and Huaizhou.</p>
<h3 id="e90">Preparation for the 28th Army's Operations <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>Deng Xihou of the 28th Army, regarding past Sichuan wars, advocated peaceful mediation and was unwilling to escalate the war. When Yuan Zuming, the commander-in-chief of the Guizhou Army, occupied Sichuan, Deng had an actual strength of eighty to ninety thousand men and guns, and controlled three-fifths of Sichuan. Since the Jinggangshan Meeting, Deng had voluntarily ceded more than thirty counties for allied forces to garrison. Last year, the 21st and 24th Armies became hostile, and he maintained neutrality. After Liu Wenhui of the 24th Army returned to Chengdu, various misunderstandings arose, and there were rumors that Liu intended to eliminate the 28th Army. Deng initially dismissed this, but later, responsible persons from the 24th Army openly expressed such intentions, and Deng began to flee the province in a panic, under the pretext of assembling troops to assist Tian Songyao in suppressing bandits, but in reality, he was actively preparing for military action. In the Xindu area, he convened a meeting of all the army's generals, and decided on three operational steps: (1) Completely concentrate all units of the army in Xindu, Jintang, and Guanghan counties, and decide on a counter-offensive plan after completing contact with all parties. (2) Completely transfer the troops in Chengdu, sacrificing all provincial institutions and ceding them to the 24th Army to avoid street fighting in the provincial capital, which would cause suffering to the people and be criticized by all parties. (3) Unite with the 29th Army for mutual survival and destruction, and unite with Liu Xiang of the 21st Army, Li Jiayu of the New 6th Division, and Luo Zezhou of the 23rd Division to jointly attack the 24th Army and fundamentally resolve the issue. If advancing is impossible, retreat entirely into Songpan, Maowen, and Maoxian to plan for a future resurgence. After the above methods were decided, the various armies of the 28th Army became determined to fight to the death against the 24th Army. Therefore, the 28th Army, which had been regarded as weak by various armies in Sichuan for many years, has now changed its past attitude and repeatedly defeated the brave troops of the 24th Army, such as Li Yushu and Shi Zhaowu.</p>
<h3 id="e91">Recent General Situation of the Sichuan War <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>Currently, the 28th and 24th Armies are in a stalemate in the Xindu, Xinfan, and Huaizhou areas. Both sides have entered a period of major warfare. Deng Xihou has personally gone to the front line to command military affairs, and Liu Wenhui also left the province on the 20th to inspect the positions.</p>
<p>In order to concentrate his forces, Liu Xihou specifically ordered Chen Shunong's division and Xie Decan to abandon Ziyang, Jianyang, and Lezhi counties, and transfer all of them to Xindu and Guanghan. As for Ziyang, Jianyang, and Lezhi counties, except for Lezhi, which has not been occupied by Liu Wenhui's troops, Ziyang and Jianyang have already fallen within the scope of the 24th Army. Deng, in order to do a favor, specifically ceded the three counties of Ziyang, Jianyang, and Lezhi to Li Jiayu of the New 6th Division and Luo Zezhou of the 23rd Division (both of which were formerly under Deng). Currently, Lezhi has been taken over by Li's troops. As for Ziyang and Jianyang, Li has also sent three brigades to take over the defense. Chen Hongwen's troops of the 24th Army did not participate in this matter, leading to conflict. In Beidouzhen, Jinjiazai, and other places, the New 6th Division opened fire on the 24th Army on the 19th, resulting in fierce fighting. At the same time, Tian Songyao of the 29th Army, who was busy suppressing the Red bandits, was deeply afraid that if the lips are gone, the teeth will be cold, endangering his army. Therefore, he has currently stopped the bandit suppression mission and sent the army's Deputy Commander Sun Zhen, leading the 2nd Division (Zeng Nanfu) and the entire 4th Division (Wang Mingzhang), to concentrate in Deyang and assist the 28th Army. Sun Deshao, in order to seek peace and resolve the Sichuan war, specifically sent Major General Chief of Staff Ma Yaozhen to the province to meet with Liu Wenhui of the 24th Army, requesting that military action be stopped and to await a solution from the central government, but he did not receive a satisfactory reply. Sun immediately ordered mobilization, and the brave soldiers of the two divisions have successively joined the 28th Army's front lines to fight, and the scope of the war has expanded.</p>
<h3 id="e92">Liu Xiang Sends Troops to Unify the Sichuan Situation <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>Since Liu Xiang of the 21st Army defeated his uncle Liu Wenhui last year, his strength has greatly increased for a time. He now has as many as 130,000 to 140,000 elite troops, and occupying the rich southeastern region of Sichuan, he inevitably has a sense of pride and is constantly preparing to unify the Sichuan situation, but he has not yet had an opportunity. Now that Liu Wenhui and Deng Xihou have started a war, and Deng's strength is not as good as that of the 24th Army, he sent representatives Xie Decan (brigade commander of the 5th Mixed Brigade of the 28th Army) and Kou Chengbo (chief of the Quartermaster Department of the 28th Army) to Chongqing to meet with Liu Xiang, requesting that he send troops to quell the chaos and jointly pacify the 24th Army and unify the Sichuan situation. Liu Xiang believes that this issue is of great importance and is not convenient to act rashly. He sent telegrams to Deng Xihou, Tian Songyao, Yang Sen, and Liu Cunhou to solicit their opinions. Deng, Tian, Yang, and others replied in telegrams, all expressing extreme approval and unanimously supporting Mr. Fu to unify Sichuan. Liu was overjoyed at this opportunity and issued a mobilization order yesterday, appointing Pan Wenying of the entire teaching division, Jian Hu of the model division, Wang Zejun of the 2nd Division, and Fan Shaozeng of the 4th Division to advance towards Jianwei, Jiading, Jingyan, and Renshou in four directions to take over the defense areas of the 24th Army, and appointed Pan Wenying as the commander-in-chief of the front and Guo Xunwen as the deputy commander to command the various troops to proceed. According to yesterday evening's telegram, the 21st and 24th Armies have already begun fighting in Jingyan and Renshou, and the scope of the war has further expanded. This is Liu Xiang's battle to unify the Sichuan situation. However, whether the fragmented Sichuan situation can be unified by Liu Xiang, we will wait and see. (22nd)</p>
<h3 id="e93">Opposition from Merchants and People in the Old Chuzhou Prefecture, Zhejiang Province, to Highway Share Payments <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>Hangzhou News: The old Chuzhou Prefecture in Zhejiang Province, including Suichang, Songyang, Longquan, Xuanping, Qingtian, Yunhe, Jinyun, Jingning, Qingyuan, and other eleven counties, has many mountains and little farmland, and is rich in forests, bamboo, and wood products, which are sold to Shanghai, Hangzhou, Wenzhou, and Japan. However, in recent years, Russian pine has been dumped, wood prices have plummeted, economic relations between China and Japan have been severed, the charcoal industry has gone bankrupt, and the bamboo and wood industry has stagnated due to the decline of the fishing industry. The entire bamboo, wood, and charcoal industry in the old Chuzhou Prefecture is in a slump. Since the "Old Chuzhou Prefecture Highway Fundraising Committee" decided to collect 8% of the highway share payments from bamboo and wood charcoal merchants, and set up three branch offices in Suichang Beijie Town, Qu County Yangkou Town, and Qingyuan City, imitating the old system of Likin stations, to assess and collect the payments themselves, up to 32% or more, starting on April 16. The armed collection personnel of the Yangkou Second Branch Office seized a wood raft belonging to Wu Guanxiang, a boatman, containing more than 500 pieces of wooden boards and more than 200 pieces of rough sections, which was assessed by the office to be worth more than 60 yuan, and would be doubled if the deadline was exceeded. However, the price of the wood was only worth more than 200 yuan according to the Hangzhou market price. After this incident occurred, it aroused a strong reaction. Bamboo and wood charcoal merchants in the old Chuzhou Prefecture gathered in the Zhangshutan Suilong Wood Industry Association, Wenzhou Wood Industry Association, and other places to discuss and believe that the highway was originally a good policy, but the share payments should be borne jointly by the people of the entire prefecture. How can the bamboo and wood charcoal industry bear this heavy burden in the midst of this decline? Furthermore, the establishment of offices to collect payments is like Likin stations, which leads to more embezzlement and makes it difficult to collect road funds. Moreover, the Highway Committee violated the provincial order that payments should be collected from the owners and that 8% should be collected according to the selling price of rich land. After consultation, it was decided to send a telegram to the provincial government requesting it to consider the difficulties of the merchants and order the Old Chuzhou Prefecture Highway Committee to abolish the Likin-like method of collecting payments, and to notify all timber firms to stop paying payments, and to elect representatives Zhang Zhize, Cheng Zhenpeng, Zhou Shenfu, Zhang Tanghua, etc., to continue to appeal to the provincial government. The provincial government has approved the order to the Civil Affairs, Finance, and Construction Departments to investigate and verify the case separately. However, during this period, Director Wang of the Yangkou Second Branch Office has intensified his efforts and, during the mountain flood on the 9th of this month, suddenly fired guns to forcibly seize and detain nine wood rafts of Xinchang, Guangchang, Youji, and other firms, containing more than 20 pieces of fir wood, which were sailing in the rapids, and imprisoned five boatmen, Huang Fuji, Fuchen, Fugan, Fushen, Liao Changxiang, etc., in the office, ordering them to pay a fine of five yuan each. By the next morning, the wood rafts had drifted away and disappeared because no one was taking care of them. The boatmen were then released. Currently, each branch office is seizing rafts as soon as they see them, and merchants and people have stopped transporting goods. Bamboo and wood charcoal merchants in the old Chuzhou Prefecture are about to close down, and hundreds of thousands of workers who depend on this for a living are also in a state of semi-unemployment. At a time when the Red bandit Fang Zhimin's troops are invading the border of Zhejiang, if it triggers a popular uprising, it will be a great hidden worry for Zhejiang Province.</p>

<p>Tax Police Execute Four Deserters</p>
<p>Four soldiers from the 1st Regiment of the Kunshan Tax Police, Fang Guiqing, Yin Fu, Chen Ping, and Wu Qing, deserted from the camp with weapons. They were captured by the regiment headquarters and sent to the general headquarters for questioning. Fang and others confessed without denying. The general commander Wen Yingxing sentenced them to death in accordance with the Army, Navy, and Air Force Law and sent them back to the county for execution. At 10:00 AM on the 22nd, the regiment headquarters sent a platoon of soldiers to bring the four criminals back, and after the regiment commander Zhao verified their identities, they were escorted to the foot of Ma'anshan Mountain and executed by firing squad.</p>

<p>Bloodshed Incident at the Dasheng Factory Due to Labor Turmoil</p>
<p>After the labor turmoil at the Dasheng Yarn Factory subsided, workers who claimed to have been injured in the conflict with the provincial security regiment stationed at the factory filed a complaint with the court against the factory's staff. The prosecutor's office scheduled a hearing on the 14th and summoned Zhu Mian, the commander of the provincial security regiment. Jiang Xian telegraphed County Magistrate Ye, stating that he had sent personnel to thoroughly investigate the labor turmoil bloodshed incident and would handle the matter impartially once the truth was obtained.</p>

<p>The provincial government investigated and found that Xu Daochun, a sand bully, had encroached on 1,500 mu of beach land in Liuhaisha and Dingxing's 6th and 7th Weirs in Nantong. It was resolved to confiscate all of the beach land and ordered the Nantong County Magistrate, together with the director of the Sand Land Sub-Bureau, to forcibly execute the return.</p>

<p>The silkworms in the county are having their major sleep and leaves are opening soon. Mulberry leaves cost 6 to 9 jiao per dan, but there are few buyers. Some businesses have already started to put the silkworms into trays. The Cocoon Industry Association has scheduled a meeting on the 16th to discuss the date of opening the market and the price of fresh cocoons. Zhao Qilu, the director of the Jiangsu Civil Affairs Department, in order to protect the cocoon market, specifically ordered Shen Weiyang, the director of the Second District of the Water Police, to order the Zhaowu, Baosu, and Jingping gunboats to concentrate and dock at the West Wharf in Wuxi, awaiting deployment to provide protection.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Chinese Yarn Factory Association, due to the accumulation of yarn and the low market price, initiated a wage reduction policy in yarn factories across the country. However, the wage reduction period is about to expire, and no results have been seen. Therefore, it has ordered yarn factories in various places to consider their own situations and make changes after the expiration of the period. Zhenxin Yarn Factory, outside the West Gate of the county, in order to take care of both labor and management, and in order to raise funds, plans to communicate and plan after the expiration date, and then decide whether to reduce wages or not. Yesterday, the factory's manager, Jiang Zeqing, notified all department staff that this month's salaries would be paid at 80% across the board. However, the wages of male and female workers will be paid as usual, but bonuses will be suspended.</p>

<p>Yang Senhe Leg Shop Sealed Up</p>
<p>The Yang Senhe Leg Shop has been open for many years and has accumulated assets of hundreds of thousands. In order to facilitate the scheduling of funds, it specifically added the Yonglong Money Shop, located in the Senhe store. Therefore, the two stores are not only fully invested in terms of assets, but also formally affiliated. Yang Yijiang is in charge of the affairs. Although it was established not long ago, it was able to attract local stores and absorb deposits due to the Senhe's strong capital. This spring, Yang Yijiang failed in speculative business, resulting in poor turnover and declared bankruptcy. The Senhe's main store, however, remained open as usual due to its deep roots and extremely wealthy family property. On the one hand, he entrusted Wang to handle the aftermath. Wang believed that the store was a famous wealthy household in the local area, and if it was not cleaned up, it would be difficult to quell public anger. Even with the current financial resources to clean up the Yonglong depositors, there would still be plenty to spare. Therefore, there was a proposal to repay 90%, which has been talked about for a long time, but has not yet been implemented. Most of the depositors, however, were unable to maintain their business or livelihood due to the impact of the Yonglong bankruptcy and had no choice but to litigate. As a result, the goods issued by Senhe were seized by the court, and the foreign port could not reach them. Yang Shaoquan, Yang Yijiang's uncle, a litigation trickster, was angered and spared no effort to expand the situation, insisting on recovering debts and repaying deposits, and canceling the original proposal to clear 90%. The court has ordered the seal to be issued because of repeated delays. It is now heard that the depositors are uniting and organizing groups. If there is still no clean-up plan after the Dragon Boat Festival, they will be forced to take further action.</p>

<p>Expansion of the Military Officer Training Class</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Security Department plans to establish a provincial military officer training class. The original plan has now been reorganized and expanded. The original internal organization was divided into four battalions and several platoons. Now, the number of battalions is not limited, and the special reorganization program has been submitted for record. Its organization is divided into ten battalions and more than twenty platoons. Trainees are designated as Grade A, B, and C: (A) Cadets, (B) Students, (C) Trainee Soldiers. The training period is still limited to six months. However, after graduating, Grade A cadets who pass the evaluation can be assigned to various counties to serve as company commanders. After graduating, Grade B students will be recommended by the institute to various military departments to serve as platoon leaders. After graduating, Grade C trainee soldiers will also be recommended by the institute to various military departments to serve as squad leaders. Trainee soldiers are selected from experienced soldiers recommended by the units under the jurisdiction of the department. Grade A, B, and C trainees are still recruited from public security officers dismissed from various counties. Everything is basically in place, and it is heard that recruitment may begin as early as mid-June.</p>

<p>In the local prison of this county, there are two bandits, Yang Deru and Tang Jiude, who have been sentenced to twelve years in prison, and Sun Zhanxiang, who has been sentenced to one year and eight months for violating the Republic of China law. Yesterday (the 20th) at 4:00 PM, they conspired to dig two holes in the prison wall and escaped to the West Gate, where they were spotted by the guards on duty. At that time, the telephone message notifying them to pay attention to the escapees came from the prison office, and the three were detained and notified to the prison office, who sent personnel to identify them, confirming that they were escapees, and immediately prepared a document to present them to the First Sub-Bureau and transfer them to the prison office for verification.</p>

<p>Silkworm Rearing Failure, Hatred in Heart, Commits Suicide</p>
<p>Due to the uneven weather this year, the silkworm rearing in Dongxiang has been poor. On the 21st, the Xu family in Jiudun borrowed a large amount of silver dollars in advance for all the mulberry leaves for the local and foreign silkworms they were rearing. Unexpectedly, the thunderstorm changed the silkworm crop, and most of the local and foreign silkworms were lost. They were unable to repay the borrowed leaves. Now that the silkworms do not spin cocoons, they felt extreme hatred and went to Renshan Yiken Tree to commit suicide. His wife rushed to the scene after hearing the news, but he had already died.</p>

<p>Xin Xin News Agency reports that since Huang Fu, chairman of the Executive Yuan's Political Consolidation Committee stationed in Beiping, went north, rumors of a Sino-Japanese armistice have been rampant. However, the rumors have been conflicting and confusing for days. Yesterday, a Xin Xin News Agency reporter specifically visited Mayor Wu to inquire about the matter. According to him, although a Sino-Japanese peace armistice is possible, it is feared that the Japanese side lacks sincere intentions, and the armistice may be difficult to achieve. If the Japanese army continues to advance towards Tianjin and Beijing, then our side will be determined to resist and will vow to resist to the death, without showing any weakness. As for Chairman Huang Fu's negotiations with the Japanese side in Beiping, the principle of not ceding sovereignty or humiliating the country must be followed. It should be known that an armistice is based on the military relationship between the two sides or through the mediation of a third party, and it is not a form of surrender. As for the rumor that our army is retreating to Baoding, it is absolutely untrue.</p>

Although the military situation in Beiping was tense, the area was still as quiet as usual when we left. There will be no more antiquities transported south in the future. As for the Jade Buddha in Tuancheng, it is made of stone and is not valuable, so it was decided not to transport it south temporarily. The throne of the Qianqing Palace (also known as the dragon chair) has now been brought along. Other miscellaneous antiquities are mostly calligraphy and painting. It is estimated that the total number of antiquities that have arrived in Shanghai, including these five batches, is over 19,000 boxes.</p>
<h3 id="e111">Anti-Dumping Duties to be Collected <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>Beginning Review of Goods Species</p>
<p>The Daily News reports that the two departments of finance and industry, in view of the dumping of foreign goods in China, which hinders the development of domestic goods, have specifically stipulated the collection of anti-dumping duties on foreign goods in order to maintain the operation of domestic goods. Before the anti-dumping duties are collected, a Foreign Goods Dumping Review Committee will be established to investigate the dumping of foreign goods in China. Yesterday, the Daily News reporter specifically inquired about everything from relevant parties, which is recorded as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e112">Collection Principle <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>In the past, when transportation was inconvenient in various countries, surplus goods in the country were often burned because they could not be transported. Today, world transportation is extremely convenient, and surplus goods can be dumped abroad. The purpose of dumping is only to get rid of the goods, regardless of profit or loss. Recently, factories in European and American countries have been affected by the economic panic and must maintain the lives of workers. Therefore, they have had to implement a dumping policy abroad. The principle of collecting anti-dumping duties is to collect duties on all dumped goods, while other promotional goods will not be taxed.</p>
<h3 id="e113">Establishment of Review Committee <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>The two departments of finance and industry believe that the collection of anti-dumping duties on foreign goods must start with the review of dumping types. Therefore, there is the organization of the Foreign Goods Dumping Review Committee. As for the candidates for its members, they are the Customs Administration, the National Tariff Commission of the Ministry of Finance, and the Agriculture Department, Industry Department, and Commerce Department of the Ministry of Industry, together with the International Trade Bureau, to organize the Review Committee.</p>
<h3 id="e114">Beginning of Review <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>The current Review Committee plans to investigate the dumping of foreign goods in China in Shanghai and other places first. It has recently started the investigation. However, the investigation is limited to the country, so it is impossible to fully understand whether a certain type of goods is dumped or promoted. Therefore, it has sent letters to consulates of various countries to investigate the prices of various goods nearby to determine whether they belong to dumping, and to collect tax rates when they are transported into Chinese ports.</p>
<h3 id="e115">Foreign Envoys Inquire <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>Since the two departments of finance and industry announced the news of the collection of anti-dumping duties on foreign goods, ministers from various countries have gone to the International Trade Bureau to inquire about the collection of anti-dumping duties on foreign goods. Yesterday morning around 10:00 AM, Hu Zan'er, commercial counselor of the Polish Embassy, and Don Elba, the Italian Consul General, went to the bureau to inquire about the collection methods and details, which were explained in detail by Ji Zejin, director of the Guidance Department.</p>

He Huaide, president of the Scripps-Howard Newspapers and president of United Press Associations, arrived in Japan at the same time as Gu Pu. However, the date of his arrival in Shanghai has not yet been determined. He may go to Manchuria first and then come to Shanghai. Both Gu and He are influential figures in the American press.

<h3 id="e119">The Aid Association of Righteous Armies Notifies the Anti-Japanese Armies of Recent Situations <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>Requesting the Chengdu Chamber of Commerce to Provide Relief with the Collected Funds</p>
<p>The Northeast Righteous Armies Aid Association sent a letter to Mr. Wang Jianming, the president of the Chengdu Chamber of Commerce yesterday. It begins as follows: "To whom it may concern, the violent Japanese are invading and occupying our Northeast, attacking Rehe, crossing the Great Wall, and directly approaching Peiping and Tianjin. The survival of the country depends on the moment. To defend against insults and save the country, we rely on the loyal and brave anti-Japanese frontline troops. Recovering the lost land depends on the righteous and brave children lurking in the Northeast. Since September 18th, General Ma Zhanshan took the lead in raising the banner of righteousness. The armies in Liaoning and Jilin, such as Li Du, Feng Zhanhai, Wang Delin, Tang Juwu, and Zhu Jiqing, have successively risen to resist Japan, fought bloody battles for many years, and established numerous extraordinary achievements. However, due to the lack of relief and the exhaustion of aid, they retreated, which allowed the Japanese bandits to have no worries and turn to the interior. Sun Dianying and Song Zheyuan's armies have advanced without retreating and fought to the death, eliminating the Japanese bandits with their spirits. The world was shocked. In the end, due to insufficient support and many constraints, they could not launch a long-drive counterattack, which formed the current crisis. It is not that there are no armies in the country that are determined to resist Japan, but that they lack the support of real strength. Our association has been calling for assistance to the Northeast Righteous Armies and relief to the anti-Japanese soldiers for many years. We are ashamed of our meager strength and cannot universally benefit all armies. However, even a small amount of food and drink can boost morale. Today, the government's ability to resist has been exhausted. To save the crisis, we should pay more attention to the power of the people. We have long admired your association leaders for their enthusiasm in saving the country. We have recently learned that you have raised a large sum of money and have not yet determined its use. We dare to present our humble opinions and respectfully ask your association to consider the difficulties of the time and quickly allocate it for the relief of the following loyal and brave anti-Japanese armies and the aid to the Northeast Righteous Armies: (1) Song Zheyuan's army (preserved Xifengkou, annihilated two brigades of the Japanese army, Suzuki and Hattori, spared no sacrifice, and vowed to fight to the death); (2) Sun Dianying's army (fought in Rehexi, firmly defended the border of Chahar, vowed to coexist with the country and never retreat); (3) Huang Shouzhong's army (Huang is the leader of the Rehe militia, loved by the people of Rehe, recently recovered Rehexi, and is a threat to the enemy); (4) Wang Yizhe and Weng Zhaoyuan's army (Wang is the only anti-Japanese general in the Northeast Army who can fight. Weng is a brave general in the anti-Japanese battle in Shanghai and is now the commander of Wang's division, determined to resist Japan to the end); (5) Fang Zhenwu's army (Fang donated his property to pay the troops and is now leading his troops to Xuanhua to defend the border of Chahar); (6) Jilin Righteous Armies (the main troops are Wang Delin and Li Du's troops, totaling 50,000 people, occupying Antu, Dongning, Muling, Fuyuan, Raohe, Hulin, Mishan and other counties, now organized by Xiao Zhenying and Men Zhizhong, with the headquarters planning operations to recover the lost territory); (7) Heilongjiang Righteous Armies (after Su Ma left Heilongjiang Province, his subordinates Pu Bingshan and other righteous armies are no less than Jilin, now the association is actively contacting them to promote their launch). The above troops are all the backbone of the anti-Japanese war and are in urgent need of assistance. If your association grants assistance, please remit it directly, or let our association transfer it, which can be put to practical use and will definitely achieve considerable results. As it concerns the important plan of saving the country, we hereby sincerely inform you and respectfully ask you to consider and reply."</p>

<p>The German Ambassador Directly Returns the Letter, Mrs. Sun and Yang Xingfo Discuss the Purpose of the Protest, and the Investigation of Prisons is Actively Underway</p>
<p>According to the New News Agency, regarding the German Ambassador Dodd returning the protest letter of the China Civil Rights Protection League, the New News Agency reporter especially met with Mr. Yang Xingfo, Executive Committee Member of the China Civil Rights Protection League, at the Academia Sinica yesterday. According to Mr. Yang, the German Ambassador's reply and the return of the protest letter were directly sent by the German Embassy in Peiping to Mrs. Soong Ching-ling, and were received yesterday. As for the purpose of the Civil Rights League's protest, it is to awaken people around the world to fight for justice. Due to his position, the German Ambassador refused to forward the protest letter to the German government, which is a matter of course. However, the League's move has attracted special attention around the world, which can be said to have achieved a considerable purpose. The Jewish Association in this city sent a letter of thanks, and the Japanese literary circles also unanimously opposed Germany's burning of books and brutal acts, which shows that justice still exists. Mr. Yang finally said that regarding the investigation of prisons, he intends to cooperate with lawyer Dong Kang and others, and invite people from all walks of life to participate in a detailed on-site investigation of the contents of various prisons in this city first, and to loudly awaken the authorities' attention to the points that should be improved.

<p>The Shanghai Consulate Will Open in One or Two Weeks</p>
<p>Negotiations on Trade Agreements and Others Have Virtually Stalled</p>
<p>According to the New News Agency, since the Soviet Russian Ambassador Bogomolov returned to Shanghai from Beijing, there have been various speculations outside. The New News Agency reporter especially went to the Russian Embassy Office on Xinzha Road yesterday morning to visit the Russian Ambassador and inquire about everything. Mr. Bogomolov, due to his busy schedule, sent the consulate secretary Takaski to meet with the reporter on his behalf. According to him, the ambassador has just arrived in Shanghai and has many things to deal with. In addition, the consulate has not yet started to work, and everything must be personally contacted. Therefore, no guests will be received for the time being. The reporter asked: "Is it true that the ambassador is in Shanghai to discuss the sale of the Chinese Eastern Railway with the Japanese Ambassador Arima Akira?" The secretary replied: "I am not convenient to express this point." The reporter asked: "Has the Japanese Ambassador Arima Akira visited?" The secretary replied: "No." The reporter asked: "When will the Shanghai Consulate start working?" The secretary replied: "In about two weeks." The reporter asked: "When will the ambassador return to Beijing?" The secretary replied: "He will stay in Shanghai for the time being, and there is no fixed date to return to Beijing. In the short term, I am afraid he will not be able to go to Beijing." According to the New News Agency reporter, it was learned from reliable sources that after the issue of the sale of the Chinese Eastern Railway occurred, it aroused resentment among our people. The negotiations on the Sino-Russian Non-Aggression Treaty and the Trade Treaty in Beijing have virtually stalled. The Russian Ambassador took the opportunity to come to Shanghai to observe the situation and then decide on his next move.</p>

<p>The Middle Cabin Public Association Opposes and Has Petitioned the Central Government</p>
<p>The Kuomintang Social Society and the Special Party Department of Chinese Seafarers, in order to reorganize the Shanghai Seafarers Union, sent members to take over the old union the day before yesterday, but were rejected and a conflict occurred. A part of the seafarers also petitioned the central government, which caused a dispute. Yesterday, the reporter specially inquired from all parties, which are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e137">Both Unions Send Members to Reorganize <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>It is found that there are more than 300,000 seafarers in Shanghai, and there are as many as 30 kinds of seafarers' organizations, with very complicated members. Since the Kuomintang took power, the Shanghai Branch of the Chinese Seafarers General Federation of Industry was established. Not long after, due to differences of opinion, a Maintenance Committee of the Shanghai Branch of the Seafarers was established, which was also approved by the Municipal Party Department (there was no Special Party Department of Seafarers at that time). Therefore, disputes arose from time to time. The Joint Office of the Nine Shipping Companies petitioned the Seafarers Party Department to reorganize it. The department sent seven people, including Chen Songnian, to form a temporary guidance committee and revoked the names of the two associations.</p>
<h3 id="e138">Conflict Occurs When Taking Over the Branch <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>After the seven committees received the order, they first went to Shenxiang Pavilion in Xinbeimen the day before yesterday to take over the documents and sundries of the Maintenance Committee, which were handed over without any problem. Then, they continued to take over the Shanghai Branch of the Seafarers in Danfeng Road, Xiaodongmen, but were rejected and petitioned the municipal government for protection in advance. The situation was serious at that time, and there was a slight conflict. Later, the guidance committee reported to the Party Department and transferred the Public Security Bureau to send police to suppress and armed takeover of a part. Yesterday morning, the handover of everything was continued, and it has now been completed and started working.</p>
<h3 id="e139">Talk from the Standing Committee of the Seafarers Party Department <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>According to Yu Jiayong, Standing Committee Member of the Special Party Department of Seafarers, the reorganization of the Seafarers Union this time is to guide the provisional measures for people's groups in accordance with the central government's regulations, and to comply with the requests of various seafarers' groups. The reception had some problems because it was bewitched by a few elements. Now the reception has been completed. Since its establishment, the Headquarters has been working hard to improve the seafarers' movement. The Seafarers Union has been reorganized into a temporary guidance committee in Qingdao, Fuzhou and Shanghai. Other South China lines and Yangtze River lines have also sent people to investigate. In the future, according to the organizational rules, a branch will be set up on each ship, a branch will be set up on important river banks, and a general union will be set up nationwide.</p>
<h3 id="e140">Some Seafarers Oppose Reorganization <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>Some seafarers in the Seafarers Middle Cabin Public Association believe that the reorganization of the Seafarers Union by the Seafarers Party Department this time is an illegal act. Because the Seafarers Union is directly under the Central People's Movement Committee and is handled directly by the central government, the department has no right to reorganize it, and the guidance committees sent are not seafarers and cannot be recognized. Therefore, representatives such as Wang Shenxiu have been promoted and went to Beijing yesterday morning to petition the Central People's Movement Committee to stop the illegal actions of the Party Department.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Wireless Telegraph Main Station of the Ministry of Communications at the Old North Gate in this city received an order from the ministry yesterday regarding Article 35 of the Telegraph Receiving and Sending Methods, which stipulates that a special delivery fee should be charged for delivering telegrams to recipients whose addresses are more than five li away from the station. In order to give preferential treatment to the recipients, telegrams will be delivered in the future, and no special delivery fee will be charged regardless of the distance if the recipient's address is within the same city as the station. It is heard that the modified article is as follows: "If the address of the recipient of a telegram delivered by a telegraph office or wireless telegraph station is within the same city as the station, no special delivery fee will be charged. If it is not in the same city, no special delivery fee will be charged within five li of the station. From five li to ten li, 15 cents will be charged. From ten li to fifty li, an additional 15 cents will be charged for every ten li. Beyond fifty li, an additional 20 cents will be charged for every ten li. For example, 95 cents should be charged for sixty li, and so on. For distances beyond ten li, the remainder of less than ten li will also be calculated according to ten li."</p>

And they have personally witnessed the roads filled with refugees, dismantling houses to exchange for food, heartbreaking and tragic, and they are deeply moved. Tomorrow and the day after tomorrow, they plan to personally inspect the disaster situation in Xianyang and other places in western Shaanxi.

<p>Since the tobacco and alcohol tax bureaus of Jiangsu, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hubei, and other provinces switched to a committee system last year, the current term is about to expire. The Tax Affairs Administration is considering and coordinating the arrangements for the next term, but has not yet announced them. Recently, some unscrupulous individuals in Jiangsu Province have been falsely claiming to be able to secure positions as bureau chiefs for the next term in order to profit from others. When Directors Liang and Luo heard about this, they were furious. In addition to dispatching officers to conduct thorough investigations to verify the truth, they also published notices in the Shen Xin and Central newspapers yesterday, strongly advising people not to be deceived and to avoid being punished in court alongside the perpetrators. It is reported that this rumor originated in the Suchang area. The bureau has instructed secret investigators to pay attention to this area and conduct secret investigations. If sufficient evidence is found, it will be immediately submitted to the court for strict punishment in accordance with the law, in order to deter evildoers.</p>

<p>Chen Sufen Commits Suicide Out of Deep Affection</p>
<p>Deng Ruiren's False Promises Lead to Tragedy</p>
<p>According to the Xin Xin News Agency, the suicide of Cantonese woman Chen Sufen by poisoning in room 412 on the fourth floor of the Hua'an Building on Jing'an Temple Road on the morning of April 16th has attracted considerable attention. When reporters began investigating, they read the woman's diary at the Xinzha Police Station and copied excerpts, which were published in various newspapers on April 17th, as readers are probably aware. At that time, calls were made to the people involved at the Baolong Hospital on Baike Road, and to Yu Zhibo, who arranged for the collection and burial after the court's inspection. Due to the urgency of the situation, details were vague. Subsequently, after reporters investigated from various sources and followed the clues in the woman's diary, the truth became clear. It is now being reported again, hoping it will be welcomed by readers and not seen as yesterday's news.</p>
<h3 id="e148">Chen Sufen, the Female Lead, Was a Famous Courtesan in Guangdong Province. <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>Sufen's name is a recent change; her name in the courtesan registry was Leng Hong. She was beautiful and refined. She attended school in her youth, but due to poverty, she was sold into prostitution at the age of fifteen. Her mother died early, and she only had an elderly father, now sixty years old. Chen was proud and unwilling to associate with the corrupt, so although she was sought after by many wealthy and powerful men, she did not favor any of them, as she was unwilling to commit herself for life. She also called herself "Tears of the Cliff" to express her ambition to choose someone to serve and escape the sea of ​​suffering. Chen never forgot this for a single day. She met</p>
<h3 id="e149">Deng Ruiren, the Male Lead, is Currently <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>Deng Ruiren, is currently the Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Guohua Bank of Shanghai and the owner of the Cangzhou Hotel. He was the Director of Finance of the 19th Route Army during the January 28th Incident in Shanghai. He is wealthy and handsome, and a well-known figure in the financial circles of Shanghai and Guangdong. He admired Chen's reputation for a long time and eventually met her at a social event. He was immediately smitten, and from then on, he was devoted to her. Chen, seeing that Deng was associated with high-ranking officials and dignitaries, and that he had both fame and fortune, was unconsciously moved. Chen then committed herself to him, and they promised to marry each other.</p>
<h3 id="e150">The Result of Deng and Chen's Relationship: <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>However, Deng already had a wife at home and was also known for being strict. Therefore, although he swore to Chen that they would fly together, it was difficult to fulfill his promise. Deng then spent some money on Chen, hoping to settle this case, but Chen insisted on her original intention and refused to marry anyone but Deng, vowing to remain single for life. Therefore, the two sides remained undecided for a long time. This was in 1923. In 1924, Sufen was just eighteen years old and gave birth to a daughter in Guangdong, who is now named "Xiangling." The birth of this child can be said to have stirred up the stagnant well, rekindling the dying embers. Chen also took this opportunity to reiterate her old promise to Deng. At this time, Deng was truly in a dilemma. If he agreed, it would be impossible, but if he abandoned her, it would be unrighteous. He had no choice but to make false promises and temporarily build a golden house. However, Chen was completely infatuated and was not satisfied until a formal wedding was held, so she constantly urged him.</p>
<h3 id="e151">She Went to Hangzhou to Study for a Few Years. But, Good Things Never Come Easy, <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>Just as Chen Sufen had found a place to settle down and was waiting for good news, she suddenly noticed that Deng's visits became infrequent and that she might not receive any more money. She tried every means to meet him, but to no avail. Even when they exchanged letters, they were like stones sinking into the sea. Recently, Deng came to Shanghai on a mission and lived in a villa. Chen found out and followed him from Guangdong to Shanghai by ship. After many efforts, she finally met Chen, and their negotiations almost went to extremes. Later, Deng, fearing that it would affect his mission, asked Chen to go to Hangzhou to study for a few years and then talk about marriage, promising to do his best to support her. Chen, feeling helpless, packed her bags and went to Hangzhou, and arranged for Deng to visit her in a day or two.</p>
<h3 id="e152">The Circumstances of Staying at Hua'an: After Chen Arrived in Hangzhou, she Lived <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>at the YMCA. Deng was forced to go to Hangzhou due to the pressure of the situation. At that time, Sufen thought that Deng's visit would show his passion for her and that he would be affectionate towards her. But again, things did not go as planned. Deng arranged to meet Chen on a boat, but later, fearing that there would be too many eyes and ears and that it would damage his reputation, he broke the appointment. Chen was resentful and strongly criticized Deng, fearing that he would abandon her altogether. At the same time, the YMCA in Hangzhou had heard rumors, so Chen resolutely left Hangzhou with Deng to Shanghai, forcing him to fulfill his previous promise. Deng kept making excuses, and finally, through the mediation of Deng's friend, Deng agreed to fulfill the promise a month later and rented room 412 in Hua'an Building for Chen to live in, telling her to wait patiently. This is how Chen Sufen came to live in Hua'an Building.</p>

<p>Deng would occasionally find time to visit her. On the night before Chen's suicide (the 15th), Deng secretly went to Hua'an at around 11:00 PM. Chen had just gone out, so he left immediately. He went again at 12:00 AM, and Chen had already gone to bed. The two were very intimate. Later, during their conversation, they talked about marriage again. Deng's words inevitably revealed some signs of prevarication. Chen then said that she would commit suicide to show Deng her determination and to prove that she had not let him down. Deng continued to perfunctorily comfort her. Unexpectedly, Chen ran into the bathroom, grabbed a bottle of Lysol used for bathing, pulled out the wooden stopper, and poured it straight into her mouth. Deng was unable to rescue her and, fearing that the incident would be discovered and be detrimental to him, he quickly put on his clothes and ran out, borrowing a phone nearby to call for a doctor. He then rushed to a friend's house and asked him to come forward and handle the matter. This is the reason for the strange phone call to Baolong Hospital and Yu Zhibo's arrangement for the coffin and burial.</p>
<h3 id="e154">Sister Rui is Deng Ruiren: The above is what the reporter <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>obtained after many days of private visits and secret inquiries. At the same time, because the woman's life was pitiful, fearing that outsiders might not know the details, it is specially reported. As for the diary entry on March 2, which mentions "Sister Rui, do you know how foolish someone is in love with you in this world?" This "Sister Rui" is Deng Ruiren. The woman feared that her diary might be lost and implicate Deng, so she wrote in a female persona to avoid suspicion. From this, it can be seen that Sufen's love for Deng can be described as meticulous, and her intentions can be described as sincere. At the same time, because of her infatuation, fearing that Deng would change his mind, she even prayed to God: "I once asked for a divination in Hangzhou, asking about how my relationship with Sister Rui will end up." This is clear evidence.</p>
<h3 id="e155">Many Shadows in the Diary: The most important entry in the diary <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>is that of March 26th. The diary also ends on this date, as</p>
<p>at this time, Sufen had just arrived in Shanghai from Guangdong and had just found Deng's whereabouts, but their meeting had no results. Therefore, the entry on March 26th is full of complaints. As a result, her words were careless and revealed her true feelings. For the sake of the readers' exploration, it is copied below without being verbose: "So, I call him from now on, but he doesn't listen. I write to him, but he doesn't read it. I can only tear it up and throw it into the wastebasket. But he treats me like this, and I don't resent him. The more he hates me, the more my guilt is reduced. I only hope that it will not affect the feelings of him and his wife. No matter how painful I am, I am willing to endure it." "The reason why I was eager to leave the YMCA this time was also to preserve his reputation, and also because Mr. Long guaranteed that I could live here." "Also, the people in charge of the YMCA know that there have been two or three phone calls to Shanghai looking for me, and they often say that a relative lives in Shanghai. If they investigate, they will definitely know the relationship between Sister Rui and me. Wouldn't that affect his position? At the same time, he and his wife will definitely have a tragedy because of me." "My usual love, especially this time with Rui, I have never announced it to anyone. I always suppressed it in my heart." "This time I really died in Shanghai, and no one can understand my heart. In short, good people are not allowed to live in this society. If I were willing to be a degenerate person, I would not have failed so much." "I will keep all the promises he made to me." "Before I met him, I could casually marry someone, but after this time and this intoxication with him, how can I marry someone else?" "The most unforgettable thing is the two nights on the boat and the month in Hua'an. When he came to Hangzhou to see me before leaving Shanghai this time, the impression of the three nights after eating cold rice will not be erased even at the time of death." "Now I hate it, but after that month in Hua'an was over, I should have died immediately, that would have been the most courageous thing to do, but what I hate the most is that this evil daughter is dragging me down. If it weren't for her, I would have died long ago, without waiting to live until now and suffer this pain." "But the most pitiful thing is that my X (Xiangling) is innocently suffering. Committing all kinds of sins, it is also my X (Sufen) and his (Rui)'s love child X (Rui) is a past life's karma, that's right. My father is already over sixty years old and will eventually come to an end. If I anger him to death this time, it will save him from suffering in this dirty society. People will eventually die, it cannot be avoided, but the most pitiful thing is X (Xiangling), who is now ten years old. When will she be able to get through these decades of suffering? Thinking of this, I can't wait to run back to Guangdong, hold my daughter, and jump into the sea together to die."</p>

<p>it can be said that she was the most infatuated. Deng, on the other hand, only provided assistance when absolutely necessary. The power of money is truly great. Although Deng tried to avoid her in every way, this woman was so deeply in love with him and steadfast in her determination, that a tragedy ensued. Afterwards, Deng used his skills to lightly cover up this major murder case, extricating himself from it. It is said that some parties feared that Deng's presence in Shanghai would affect his mission due to this case, so they urgently recalled him. All of Sufen's belongings are still being held by the prosecutor of the First Special District Court, waiting to be claimed. According to reporters, it is feared that no one will claim them for a long time.</p>

<h3 id="e159">Tenants in the French Concession Demand <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>Rent Conversion from Tael to Yuan, Zhou Lianji Returns the Original Letter, Tenants Continue to Protest</p>
<p>The tenants along the streets of the French Concession, including Balijiao Road, West Zilaihuo Street, Caishi Street, and Yuqing Lane, have jointly written to the landlord Zhou Lianji and a certain accounting firm, requesting permission to change the rent from taels to yuan (originally calculated in silver taels) to alleviate the burden due to the recent economic downturn and poor business. After sending the letter, the landlord Zhou Lianji returned the original document, but marked on the back of the envelope, "This property is handled by the accounting firm." The accounting firm also replied to the tenants, stating that they should request the landlord. Because the tenants did not achieve their goal of changing the rent, they gathered all the tenants along the street yesterday afternoon to discuss relief methods. They all said that when the French Concession's economy had not yet declined last year, the tenants in the lane requested a rent reduction, and the landlord and tenant representatives negotiated in May, approving the reduction. Only our tenants along the street did not receive any rights, which is obviously unfair. Moreover, the current economic downturn is at its extreme. If no measures are taken to provide relief, there is a real fear that bankruptcies will follow one another. Therefore, it was decided to appoint Tan Huisheng of Yonghua Company, Jin Hongxun of Guohua Company, Hong Yongyu of Brothers Socks Factory, Zhang Huiqiao of Meifeng Silk Store, Shen Yongkang of Yongkang Sauce Garden, Gu Guangfu of Xieji Egg Shop, Yao Zhaoji of Chunjiang Hotel, Jiang Maotang of Ruyi Restaurant, and Wang Yongkang of Xiekangsheng as authorized representatives to continue negotiations with the landlord Zhou Lianji and a certain accounting firm to achieve the goal of changing the rent. At the same time, a custody committee was organized to deposit the rent to be paid into a bank for safekeeping. The representatives were scheduled to meet with the landlord in person to ask him to consider the current economic downturn in the French Concession, which has reached its extreme, and to consider reducing the rent burden to provide relief and maintain commerce.</p>

<p>Two Incidents of Respectable Women Feeling Deeply Embarrassed Occurred in One Day</p>
<p>丨Arrests Made and Stern Punishment Handed Down by the Court丨</p>
<p>Idlers and vagrants are most numerous in the concessions of this city. These people do nothing all day long except call friends and roam the streets. When they see young women, whether they are noble ladies, famous courtesans, or dissolute women, they all flirt with them, corrupting morality and insulting women. Almost every day this happens. The day before yesterday, two incidents occurred in succession: (1) Qin Jinyuan, accompanied by his wife, Gao, and his relative Chen Tan, was walking near the intersection of Danshui Road and Fuxu Road when Zhang Chengyan, a man from Pudong, suddenly saw that the two women were quite attractive and stopped them to make jokes and say obscene words. He also reached out and touched Gao's left leg. Qin scolded him severely. Zhang became angry out of shame and, in an instant, gathered seven or eight of his gang members and surrounded the Qin couple. Without any discussion, they began to beat them. Although Qin and his wife resisted, they were no match and were all injured. The gang then dispersed. When the police arrived after hearing the alarm, most of them had fled far away. Only Zhang Chengyan, the leader, was arrested and taken to the Xinzha Police Station for detention. (2) Wang Yingxiang and his wife, Wang Fengying, and his wife's younger sister, Wang Er'e, were walking to the intersection of Weihaiwei Road and Muming Road. Wang Yingxiang had a sudden urge to urinate and went into a nearby alley, asking his wife to wait by the roadside. It was already dusk. Wang Er'e, a man from Hangzhou, happened to pass by and saw this pair of beautiful women standing gracefully under the electric lights. He suddenly had a wicked thought and thought it was a great opportunity to lure them. He stepped forward and pretended to be attentive, trying to force them to go to a hotel with him. Just as the Wang sisters were in a predicament, Wang Yingxiang came out of the alley. Upon learning that his wife's younger sister had been harassed, he argued with Wang Er'e. Wang then let out a shout, and his gang members suddenly arrived. They then started fighting, and the Wang couple suffered minor injuries. They then reported it to the Jing'an Temple Road Police Station, and detective Qian Xianting arrested Wang Er'e. Yesterday morning, he was brought to the First Special District Local Court together with Zhang Chengyan. Judge Wang Ren conducted a preliminary hearing. The police lawyer Chen Baolian stated the facts of the case, saying that both defendants were being charged with assault and requested strict punishment. Qin and Wang, along with their families and witnesses, came to court to testify about the situation at the time. When questioned, the defendants all pleaded guilty and did not make any excuses. After the interrogation, Judge Wang immediately announced the verdict, sentencing Zhang Chengyan to four months of imprisonment and Wang Er'e to two months of imprisonment, as a warning.</p>

<p>The Official Documents and Symbols Were All Forged, Confessed to Being Purchased for 30 Yuan, Involving Elementary School Teacher Chen Mou, Who Has Been Arrested and Will Be Transferred</p>
<p>On the 26th of last month, He Jinqian, dressed in military uniform and wearing symbols, boarded a train from Shanghai to Beijing without buying a ticket. He was interrogated by the military police stationed on the train. He claimed to be a staff member of the Military Commission's rear hospital and was going to Beijing on official business. He immediately took out a document from the rear hospital. Upon closer inspection, the military police found that the text and symbols were all forged, and he was undoubtedly impersonating a military officer. He was placed under guard. When the train arrived in Nanjing, he was escorted to the Capital Garrison Command. After a preliminary interrogation by a military judge, He confessed that he had paid 30 yuan to Chen Yuanding, a teacher at Renci Elementary School at No. 181, De'an Lane, North Shanxi Road, a Shaoxing native, to introduce him to Shen Lijun. Shen gave him the uniform and symbols, claiming that he was the director of the Military Commission's rear hospital and was sending him to Beijing on important business.</p>
<h3 id="e162">New Invention to Prevent Car Theft <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>According to the Shanghai Times, 27,000 of the 28,000 bicycles in this city may have been received some good news. It is reported that an inventor in this city has invented a new design that can prevent car thieves from using their methods. The main mechanism is in a small iron box, installed behind the triangle frame, and connected to the rear wheel. If the car owner parks the car on the road, he only needs to turn the key, and if someone moves the car or causes the rear wheel to turn, the box will immediately emit a warning similar to a ship's whistle. The thief will definitely abandon the car and run away in fright when he suddenly hears the loud noise. When the car owner moves the car, he only needs to turn the key in the opposite direction to drive away safely without making a warning sound.</p>
<p>The Headquarters obtained this information and sent a letter to the Shanghai Public Security Bureau, requesting assistance in the arrest. At 10:30 am the day before yesterday, Supervisor Fu Sucun of the Municipal Public Security Bureau first reported to the Huishi Police Station. Together with Chinese Detective Shen Dehui, they arrested Chen Yuanding at Renci Elementary School in De'an Lane, while Shen Lijun had already fled after hearing the news. Chen was taken back to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Criminal Division of the First Special District Court. The police lawyer Li Zhishan stated the above situation, saying that the defendant, Chen Yuanding, was arrested by the Municipal Public Security Bureau based on the confession of the criminal He Jinqian, who was apprehended by the Nanjing Garrison Command. Now, the Municipal Public Security Bureau has sent representatives to the case, requesting transfer. The police station also has no objections. Then, Supervisor Fu Sucun of the Municipal Public Security Bureau reported the circumstances of the joint arrest and requested the transfer, saying that the official documents of the Public Security Bureau were not prepared in advance and were not brought to the case. They would be submitted in the afternoon. Chen Yuanding claimed that he did not know He Jinqian, but that Shen Lijun was introduced to him by a friend. Therefore, he was completely unaware of He's actions. He also hired a lawyer to defend him in court. After verifying the confession, Judge Liu Yugui ordered Chen Yuanding to be temporarily detained in the detention center of this court, pending the arrival of the transfer documents from the Municipal Public Security Bureau, which would be transferred immediately to the case for interrogation.</p>

<p>Li Xiushan, a 20-year-old native of Zhaopu, lives at No. 11 Haining Road. He has a father, a stepmother, and two older brothers. Because Li only engaged in lowly activities and did not strive for progress, his father ordered him to learn the printing business in order to prepare to open a shop in the future. However, good advice grates on the ear, and Li dropped out halfway, which led to him being looked down upon by his family. Li wanted to live a life of leisure but could not, and the money in his hand became increasingly tight, so he had a pessimistic thought. At 5:45 PM on the day before yesterday, he boarded ferry No. 10 at the New Customs Wharf and crossed to the Huangpu River. Li immediately jumped into the raging waves to commit suicide. Fortunately, he was rescued by the ferry captain and sent to the Customs Water Police Station. After the police chief learned the truth, he ordered patrolman Huang Songsheng to send him home.</p>
<h3 id="e165">Chen Hu <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>At 7:45 PM the night before last, a middle-aged woman jumped into the river from the Zhejiang Road Bridge on Suzhou Creek to commit suicide. Fortunately, she was spotted by a Chinese policeman at the Customs Water Police Station, who immediately took steps to rescue her and took her to the police station. She claimed that her name was Chen Hu, 33 years old, from Hangzhou, and lived in the Pinle Tea Garden in the French Concession. She had no family in Shanghai, was lonely, and very poor. She had also been ill for many days and had no money to see a doctor. Unable to bear the suffering, she sought death. The police chief, feeling very sorry for her, ordered patrolman Qu Hekui to send her to Renji Hospital for treatment first and then find ways to help her.</p>

<h3 id="e180">Wen Hongen Talks About the Dispute at Quanzhang Middle School <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>A reporter from the Xinxin News Agency inquired about the truth of the case where Yang Jingshi, Ye Qinghe, and others falsely reported to the Public Security Bureau that the Quanzhang Guild Hall had sent police to arrest and injure students of Quanzhang Middle School, and posted an emergency notice in the newspaper seeking assistance from all sectors. Yesterday, they specially visited Director Wen of the Public Security Bureau to inquire about the truth of the case. The conversation is recorded as follows: (Question) Did Yang Liangshi expel the principal and falsely report that the students were reactionary, and did the Public Security Bureau send police to search the school? (Answer) The faculty and staff of Quanzhang Middle School were previously divided into different factions, and some students were used to attack each other, resulting in disturbances. Later, upon order, the school was temporarily closed by the Education Bureau because the school's members were complex and there were indeed reactionaries inciting them. As for sending police to search, that was not true. (Question) Did the Public Security Bureau send armed police to arrest students and falsely accuse them of being communists at the request of Yang Jingshi? (Answer) After Quanzhang Middle School was closed, a small number of students still occupied the school, and more than 30 students who were not originally from the school were recruited to the school, intending to cause trouble. The Education Bureau approved the Municipal Government to dissolve the school's students together with police officers of this bureau. Later, the number of students gathered more and more, nearly a hundred people. Not only did they not listen to the dissolution order, but they also summoned people from outside the school to openly hold a meeting, establishing the prohibited National Resistance to Insults Self-Salvation Association, Quanzhang Branch, South Shanghai District. On April 13, more than ten students beat and injured the guard hired by the school and the school servant stationed at the school. Because the students occupying the school had acted excessively, the Education Bureau sent a letter requesting that the students staying at the school be released on bail separately. If they were not good members, they would be dismissed from the school by the board of directors with the assistance of their fellow villagers. However, the students still ignored the order, and various transgressions occurred from time to time. This bureau believed that the situation was urgent, so on the 19th of this month, it ordered police officers to go to enforce the dissolution in order to maintain public security. After the officers repeatedly persuaded them, the students remained deaf to them and dared to resist and shout, and threw chairs and benches. The momentum was fierce, and it seemed that they wanted to seize weapons. On the same day, police officer Wang Tongjie of the Rihuigang Branch, etc., were all beaten at the same time. Police chief Xu Rongbin's right arm and police officer Liu Huaifa's left leg were injured by sticks and benches. As a last resort, the police officers brought the rioting students Wu Zhen, etc., 45 people, and the school servant Chen Azhong, etc., who participated in the riot, to the bureau. Five kinds of communist propaganda materials were found in the school courtyard. When the students were brought to the bureau, they dared to shout "Long live the Communist Party". After separate interrogations, they all admitted to defying the dissolution order and obstructing official duties. The criminals, evidence, leaflets, and confessions have all been transferred to the court for handling. As for the request made by Yang Jingshi, that did not happen. (Xinxin News Agency)</p>

<h3 id="e194">Marriage Troubles <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>| Letter from Mr. Wu Yitian of Wuxian County |</p>
<p>I am from the northern part of Wuxian County. My father died early, and my mother is still alive. My family is extremely poor. Our daily life depends solely on my mother's domestic work income. I studied old-style books for three years when I was young. At the age of twelve, my mother sent me to a small town to learn the business of ramie and sundries stores. In less than a year, I ran away home because I couldn't bear the abuse of the store owner and his wife. That year, my mother arranged for me to be engaged to a Xue girl from a neighboring family, who was illiterate and very foolish, in a compulsory manner. At that time, due to my level of knowledge and the constraints of traditional shame, I silently acquiesced without any resistance. Later, a diligent fellow villager often lent me various books and, a year later, registered me for a rural normal school and encouraged me to take the entrance exam. Fortunately, I passed the exam this time, and thus began my school life. In the winter of that year, my mother again forced me to marry the Xue girl, and I repeatedly refused. Unexpectedly, my mother cut off my financial support, and I was immediately in danger of dropping out of school. Considering this, I had no choice but to obey my mother's orders and go through a marriage ceremony. However, in those ten years, I never had any physical relationship with her, I can swear to heaven. After graduation, I became a teacher, then a principal, and then obtained a small leadership position as a low-level autonomous worker. Last winter, we both understood the pain of not being able to cooperate at all. Why ruin the future happiness of both of us? We both realized this and proposed divorce terms, obtained the consent of both parties, had a lawyer certify it, and filed it with the court. After going through legal procedures, both parties voluntarily dissolved the marital relationship, which was not a difficult problem. However, the general remnants of feudalism relentlessly attacked me, believing that a wife who has shared hardship should not be divorced, and that this act was a heinous crime and a degradation of personality. Editor, please say a fair word! What do you think of my behavior! Can marriage problems be compromised? Or should they be taken seriously? This is unexpected, "one wave has not subsided, and another wave rises again!" Since my divorce, due to the intense nature of my autonomous work, I have had few opportunities to get close to young women of equal thoughts and knowledge. Therefore, a classmate, Du, introduced me to a Yang girl from an old-fashioned family, who was said to be able to read and write a little, of excellent character, and able to manage the household in an orderly manner. I believed it to be true, thinking that Du was my old classmate and would never deceive me. He also took me to the Jiang girl's house for a meal. At that time, limited by the walls of feudal society! Before the conventions of men and women meeting freely had been broken, I still felt it was inconvenient to talk to the Jiang girl. This time, I only gained the impression that "the inside is unknown, but the appearance is acceptable." Therefore, on that day, I exchanged photos and miscellaneous items through a matchmaker and paid a deposit of ten yuan, preparing to send the betrothal gifts on a fixed date, almost completing the initial work of an old-fashioned marriage. In less than a few days, I learned of many unpleasant things, such as being unchaste! Illiterate! Bad family history! I immediately expressed my refusal and stopped the process. Afterwards, the Jiang girl's father, instead, crazily negotiated directly with me, demanding compensation for reputational and material losses. Recently, I have been feeling overwhelmed and mentally confused. If it comes to litigation, I cannot produce the kind of evidence that "there is a cause, but no evidence is found" in court, and I have no legal certainty, and my position may be shaken as a result. If I want to settle the matter peacefully, the other party's harsh conditions are difficult to accept. This matter has reached a stalemate, and it is difficult to resolve it well. I implore the knowledgeable and experienced editor to quickly think of a proper solution for me and indicate the path I should take. And how can I find a lover in the future? Is there any hope for satisfaction in this transitional period?</p>
<p>Answer: Your letter has been read and understood, and I will reply briefly as follows: (1) Marriage problems cannot be compromised; (2) You formed an acquaintance with her and even got engaged simply based on what others said about her being good; when others said she was bad, you had problems with her: what "many unpleasant things," what "unchaste," what "illiterate," what "bad family history," causing you to lose your mind, which shows that you are a person who "relies on ears instead of eyes" and has no opinion of your own. Now that the person is in front of you, you can interact with her, "seeing is believing, hearing is deceiving." Is she really "illiterate"? Are there really many unpleasant things? Even if she lost her virginity in the past, but she sincerely loves you now, what does it matter? How bad is the family history? Was she a prostitute? Was she secretly promiscuous? Even if so, what direct relationship does it have with her? Even if she herself was bad in the past, but she now shows herself to be a self-loving and upward-striving person in her actions, should her present good qualities be buried because of her past deeds? Frankly speaking, "a prodigal son who returns is worth more than gold." If I didn't have a wife, I would definitely look for a woman who was "bad" in the past but has now repented, a woman who was "unchaste" in the past but now wholeheartedly wants to be a good person, and reject those unmarried ladies who think they are flawless and pure as jade. Because the latter have never experienced the world, have never been in the dirty society, that is to say, have never been to the testing ground, no one can guarantee whether they will stumble in the future. On the other hand, the former have already tasted the bitterness of bad society, and as the saying goes, "know all the true and false feelings of people." Now that they have come to their senses and "laid down the butcher knife," they are looking for a place to settle down. If you get along with them, they will definitely be considerate and give you a lot of comfort. In the past, there was a scholar whose wife died. He wrote a letter to a friend saying that he was preparing to look for a widow to remarry. Someone asked him why, and he said that a widow had experienced the death of her husband and must know the pain of losing a husband. Now that she is marrying again, she will definitely know how to cherish her husband. Although his words are close to jest, there is indeed a profound truth in them, which I will use to tell you. In short: make up your own mind and never "eat mutton when you fall east, and eat dog meat when you fall west."</p>

<h3 id="e195">Eccentric Rejects Birthday Celebrations <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>— Zhan Lu</p>
<p>The world's three great eccentrics are, in Italy, Mussolini; in Germany, Hitler; and in Japan, Araki Sadao.</p>
<p>If one were to write a comparative essay on these three, Araki Sadao's eccentric score would probably not pass. He only knows how to bully weak countries, where is the eccentricity in that? The eccentric status of Italy's Mussolini has been maintained for a long time, and it is still flourishing. Recently, he has been showing his face on the political stage, with an arrogant air of invincibility, scaring away Einstein, the inventor of "relativity," and frightening many "Shylock"-style Jewish tycoons who exploit heavy profits. Even his words have attracted the attention of the world's powers. If his tone is peaceful, the powers seem to be reassured; if his tone is fierce, the powers frown as if a catastrophe is about to erupt. Alas! The prime minister of a defeated country is so valued, Hitler's eccentricity is simply a well-deserved eccentricity!</p>
<p>Last month, on a certain day, was the forty-fourth birthday of the eccentric Hitler. A powerful minister celebrating his birthday is, of course, a good way to make a fortune. But look, which powerful ministers in Chinese history did not celebrate their birthdays lavishly? A group of servile and obsequious subordinates and officials could take this opportunity to bring gold to the powerful's door and lobby for good positions in front of the birthday celebrant. As long as one birthday is celebrated, the "birthday tribute" from all directions will bring in countless gold, jewels, and treasures. Even second- and third-rate dignitaries who are not powerful or not ministers are unwilling to miss this opportunity to make a fortune on their birthdays. No matter how much the public laughs and scolds, the birthday celebrant will do it his own way, this is a traditional mindset of Chinese officials.</p>
<p>Too much has been said, straying from the topic of this article. After all, does Hitler celebrate his birthday or not? On his birthday, German President Hindenburg presented him with a personally signed silver-framed photograph, such an extraordinary honor that it seemed necessary to celebrate his birthday lavishly. However, he actually rejected the birthday celebrations. However, although he rejected the birthday celebrations, the public insisted on celebrating his birthday for him. On this day, all the newspapers in the country had a special section on Hitler. The National Socialist Party headquarters received a continuous stream of congratulatory telegrams from all directions. Party members and the Steel Helmet League participated in a review in front of the Berlin Ministry of Interior. All government agencies hung flags to celebrate, and in the evening there was a grand lantern parade. The people supported him to such an extent, which is something the eccentric can be proud of.</p>
<p>A fine old Chinese man who relies on celebrating birthdays to make a fortune sneered: Hitler, although you have the support of the people, but by refusing to celebrate your own birthday, you have missed an opportunity to make a fortune. You are not a birthday celebrant, you are a fool.</p>

<p>Miss X next door graduated from middle school and is lonely at home. One day, she saw an advertisement in the newspaper saying, "XX Company is recruiting female staff," which touched her heartstrings. She excitedly ran to the company to register for the exam. On the day of the exam, Miss X changed into a brand new fashionable cheongsam, brought some necessary items, and became a member of the examinees. At that time, there were middle-aged women, modern girls, beautiful and ugly, crowding a room. Of course, they were all hoping to "seek women's economic independence." Everyone managed to write a vernacular essay and a letter, and then left the venue. The person in charge told them: Come back in three days to hear the results. Three days later, in the afternoon, Miss X excitedly ran back to hear the news. The person in charge of the company said to her: Our company has already selected several female staff members, with a monthly salary of fourteen yuan, all of whom are "graceful and slender" modern ladies. Your level, madam, is indeed not bad. However, your figure is too fat, so you failed. This is related to the business of our company, so we have to be strict in our selection. Miss X was ashamed and angry when she heard this, turned around and left. She could still vaguely hear someone saying: A big lump like that also wants to be a "flower vase," she really doesn't know her place.</p>
<p>Miss X was extremely angry, looked around, as if the world</p>
<p>was too narrow, and her body seemed to be magnified several times, and quietly went home. She didn't eat dinner and cried all night.</p>
<h3 id="e197">Meritorious Dog <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>— Bing Ding</p>
<p>Dogs have no country, they are not required to fulfill the obligations of "serving in the military" and paying taxes, and they certainly do not enjoy the rights of "slaves of a fallen country." Of course, humans cannot compare to dogs. Moreover, there are now dogs that can make movies: dog stars | dogs that protect wealthy people: police dogs | dogs that help hunters: hunting dogs | and dogs that contribute to the country: meritorious dogs |. The great achievements of dogs are, after all, impressive, and of course, humans cannot compare to dogs. For those who have contributed to the country, of course, they should be rewarded according to their merits. Even ancestral sacrifices and temple worship for thousands of years are the duties that cannot be shirked. Because Zeng Disheng's Xiang Army broke Nanjing, many people died, so he built the Xiang Army Zhaozhong Temple in Nanjing. He also wrote a great article to praise the loyalty of the Xiang Army who died in battle. During the January 28th Incident, many members of the 19th Route Army who resisted the Japanese army died, and some people initiated the establishment of a Tomb of Unknown Heroes. Only when it comes to rewarding animals for their merits, we Chinese people have never thought of it. It is already unfortunate to be a Chinese, but it is even more unfortunate to be a Chinese dog or horse.</p>
<p>It is said: "The Japanese military has decided to implement meritorious rewards for military animals from June 1st. The categories are divided into A, B, and C. The animals to be rewarded are military horses, military dogs, and military pigeons. For these animals that died for the country, a memorial hall will be established in Zojo-ji Temple in Shiba Park, and they will be enshrined in this hall." I think that the Japanese treat dogs and horses that died for the country so generously, and their Japanese dogs and horses will certainly serve the country as well as the Japanese. Returning to the topic, our noble country has not built temples or set up spirits for these animals that died for the country. Their loyal souls wander, and they have to use the heavens and earth as their coffins and the sun and moon as their burial shrouds. If the souls of beasts have knowledge, they will also sigh that they are inferior to Japanese dogs and horses.</p>

<p>Far away, the sound of the呜呜 whistle of the train is heard, and the train like a long snake, meandering and slowly enters the platform: a burst of noisy sounds suddenly rise, at this time, there are single travelers, very lightly carrying a briefcase, quickly jumping down, walking out of the platform, that is to say, they have arrived in Shanghai, without any troublesome events, there are also single people, but they bring a lot of cumbersome luggage, some on their shoulders, some on their arms, some in their hands, but they really feel the bitterness of going out, some bring their wives or children, and also bring a lot of luggage and odds and ends, and also want to save money, so troublesome events occur, their own things, it is not good to ask their wives to take them, it is not strong enough to ask their children to take them, in this situation, I know that they feel very distressed, there are also comfortable friends, on the train, just a greeting to the workers wearing round-topped hats, and they will peacefully take your things, walk out of the platform, but you have to pay attention, the tip for them, can not be too little, nor too much: too little, they will think you are "stingy," too much, they will think you are "a sucker." In front of the luggage cart, it also becomes a noisy market, the workers, in the carriages, stack and throw the luggage of others, which is not their own, one by one on the platform, if you bring three pieces of luggage, then to find it as your own, it will take at least a quarter of an hour, of course, it is an exception if it is placed in a place where you can see it, they will scatter your three pieces of luggage, and also push your luggage with the luggage of others, making it difficult for you to check, this is about the platform,</p>
<p>When you walk out of the platform, although there is now a</p>
<p>rope apart, but the mouths of the hotel staff are not sealed. They are still shouting and yelling, disturbing people's eardrums. There are also general self-offering diligent carriage, car, rickshaw touts to solicit you, carry luggage for you, take parts, so that you have to take his car, if you agree to his request, then you will at least have to compare</p>
<p>The price is more than double the usual hire, and sometimes it will make your luggage disappear.</p>
<p>Now, the Public Security Bureau has finally made a regulation that rickshaws are not allowed to stop in front of the station, otherwise, the rickshaw encirclement will also be unbearable. This is about the outside of the North Station.</p>
<p>The characteristics of the North Station are originally like this!</p>
<h3 id="e199">Four Company Commanders of the Northeast <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Seven: Several words sever affection and close the door to weep in pain; one shoulder bears righteousness and discuss matters over wine.</p>
<p>Jiang said: On the first day of the new year, I should also invite him to eat something. Please trouble Zhao Company Commander to tell him, I am waiting here. Zhao Company Commander</p>
<p>Knowing what kind of article he would have inside, naturally agreed. After about an hour, Yan Yintian, the three company commanders, came one after another. Zhao Weng smiled and arranged everyone properly, and said with a smile: I am very happy to see you brothers so strong and vigorous, but every time you are here laughing and joking, I am very happy, but after you all leave, I am very lonely, so it is better if you don't come. Yin Deren scratched his hair and smiled slightly: Old people like excitement, but I don't think so. If you don't want any excitement at all, you naturally don't know what it means to be indifferent. Zhao Weng smiled and said: Because of this, you don't take a company commander's wife. But when you are carrying a gun, you can not want a wife, but when you retire to your hometown in the future, you still don't want a wife? Look at me, so old, only alone, living in this half-rural, half-town place: he said to this place, fearing that his son would have any misunderstanding, took a look, he smiled slightly: This is what I say again, I am just afraid of being alone, so I moved here to be close to Ziqiang. You are not married now, where did the son come from, when you reach my age in the future, see if you are lonely? Tian Qing took out a small white handkerchief from the small pocket of his suit, placed it on his knee, folded it endlessly, but a slight smile appeared on his face. Zhao Weng thought he had some discussion, touched the long beard under his chin, and looked at him and said: Company Commander Tian, ​​you are the youngest, you must hear what I said, right? Zhao Ziqiang was afraid that his father would talk and talk, and would talk about his own marriage problem, so he repeatedly said: The dishes are all ready, let's eat. As he spoke, he was busy setting up bowls, chopsticks, and chairs on the table in the middle room, making a gesture of not having time to pay attention to what others were saying. (79)</p>
<p>The Voice of National Salvation</p>
<h3 id="e200">National Scholars Should Quickly Establish Standards for Saving the Country <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>— Continued by Zhuan</p>
<p>I have heard that all things have a fixed standard, and the issue of saving the country is certainly no exception. A standard means that within a certain scope, there must be a certain number of things that can be done, and within that scope, there must also be a certain number of things that cannot be done. If clear standards can be established for saving the country, then people of average ability will know what to do, and outstanding individuals will also know where to stop. Overly ambitious pursuits are unacceptable, and so is being weak and shrinking back. National crisis is something that no one has experienced. When troops are lost and territory is seized, students across the country often display a sense of helplessness. Students at one school want to volunteer for the army, while students at another school want to buy airplanes for war preparedness. Some truly rush to the front lines, while others truly donate all their savings. This is what Mencius meant by "human nature is inherently good; if it can be fully developed, it is enough to protect the entire world." The ignorant fail to observe this, saying that the effort is too small for the task and that it is like a drop in the bucket. Yet, no one loudly calls for the continuous establishment of standards for saving the country in academic circles. This is a major issue that both new and old scholars should pay close attention to. It should start with one school taking the lead, and then other schools will follow suit. For example, if a fire breaks out in someone's house, the fire has already started, and everyone in the family is in a panic. Some even leave valuable clothing chests untouched and only grab a rice pot from the kitchen. We cannot blame them for lacking the ability to move furniture; we should excuse their lack of experience with house fires. However, the Shanghai Fire Brigade is different. When a fire breaks out outside, the firefighters are fully prepared and armed, waiting. When the lookout tower rings an alarm bell, the fire engine has already arrived outside the door. Upon hearing the bell indicating the direction and street, they immediately rush to the fire scene to fight the fire. In an orderly manner, each person performs their duty, and the fire will certainly not spread. The helplessness of students at various schools is like grabbing a rice pot during a fire. And the establishment of standards for saving the country by new and old scholars across the country is like establishing a fire brigade.</p>
<p>The enmity between Germany and France has led to several times in 130 years where they have bet their entire country.</p>
<p>However, the German philosophy professor Hegel, at the University of Jena, on the day in 1806 when Napoleon led his troops to invade, held his manuscript in the lecture hall and looked out the window, jokingly commenting on Napoleon as the "world spirit" (I saw a cartoon of this in the new edition of the Encyclopedia Britannica).</p>
<p>This was the attitude of a philosophy professor during a national crisis in Germany. Also, the German chemistry professor Louis Pasteur, who took refuge in Arbois, said on the day in 1870 when Bismarck designated the annexation of Alsace and Lorraine: "Desperate efforts in a laboratory are just like being on a battlefield." This was the attitude of a science professor during a national crisis in France. Both of these men became prominent figures who enriched their countries with philosophy and science. It is truly said that "adversity awakens the wise, and hardship strengthens a nation." New scholars in our country are familiar with this kind of history and will surely find many pieces of evidence in books, which can also serve as materials for establishing standards for saving the country.</p>
<p>As for the old scholars, I want to loudly awaken them and say: Do not</p>
<p>appoint yourselves to wait for the right time like Wang Tong and Chen Bu, and do not appoint yourselves to restore the country after a hundred years like Gu Tinglin and Huang Lizhou. Today's national crisis is not a small domestic political turmoil; it is a national crisis of becoming slaves and being exterminated as a race. You must appoint yourselves like Guan Zhong and Yue Yi, like the followers of Mozi, You Qin Huali, and like Liu Bei, a follower of Zheng Xuan, and like Shi Kefa, a follower of Zuo Guangdou. And you must never lecture on the "Great Learning" in a boat at Yai Shan, allowing Yan Xizhai to criticize you for reading dead books. If "LIBERTY" is translated as "仁" (benevolence), how could the entire country's moral principles be so unrestrained? If "EQUALITY" is translated as "義" (righteousness), how could the entire country's order be so chaotic? Individualists emphasize that their efforts should come from themselves, not that they must exclusively enjoy the benefits. The sanctity of labor emphasizes that goods should not be abandoned, not that butchers are living Buddhas. Materialists use raw materials to develop things and refine manufacturing to accomplish tasks, not to just "buy things." The process of natural selection involves internal cooperation and external competition, not "abandoning etiquette and concession." Those who grasp these key points should have the wisdom of Zhuge Liang, the foresight of Fan Zhongyan, the talent of Wang Yangming, the scholarship of Weng Wenduan, and the good governance of Lin Zexu. With the power of a short message, they can influence the vision and hearing of China. Why wait to lecture before understanding? Alas! When people are in dire straits, they call out to heaven; when they are in pain, they call out to their parents. During the Xinhai Revolution, there was a call for "humanitarianism" from both Chinese and Westerners. However, the Beiyang warlord Yuan Shikai and his ilk followed Sun Yat-sen's model. This time, the League of Nations investigation includes a call for "national character." If it succeeds, will heaven repent and change disaster? Will the country have hope? This is what all Chinese people should possess: a spirit of "turning the tide and transforming the world."</p>

<p>Middle School Volleyball Team Reclaims Championship, Overcoming Great China 3-1</p>
<p>The Middle School Volleyball Championship, with the participation of ten schools, was divided into Shanghai</p>
<p>groups for competition. After several days of battles, Fudan Experimental Middle School and Great China Affiliated Middle School qualified for the final. The final was held at the Chinese Athletic Field yesterday afternoon at 3:00 p.m., with 400-500 spectators. After four thrilling sets, Fudan defeated Great China 3-1 to win the Middle School Volleyball Championship.</p>
<p>In the first set, Fudan took the lead with a score of 21-19. In the</p>
<p>second set, Great China made a concerted effort to return the favor with a score of 21-19. However, they failed to continue their momentum in the third and fourth sets, and Fudan won both sets with scores of 21-17 and 21-18. Overall, the three forwards of Fudan Experimental Middle School were very meticulous in their blocking and defense, allowing the middle row to calmly take advantage of opportunities to smash the ball. This was the reason for their victory. As for Wang Deyuan of Great China's middle row, his spikes were very powerful, but there were occasional lapses in defense in the front and back rows, which led to their defeat in the later two sets. Referee: Li Xinbiao. The lineups of both teams are as follows:</p>

<p>John's and Huilan Win in Tennis; John's and Yancheng Win in Volleyball</p>
<p>(Suzhou, 23rd) The 5th Jiangsu-Zhejiang Private Middle School Tennis and Volleyball Championship began on the 23rd at Yancheng School in Suzhou. Participants included six schools: John's, Mingqiang, Taowu, Yancheng, Cuiying, and Huilan. Cuiying forfeited the tennis competition. Today's preliminary round included two groups in tennis and three groups in volleyball. The results are as follows:</p>
<p>In today's tennis match between Huilan and Mingqiang, Huilan won all three singles matches. Because of improper player positioning, Mingqiang protested. As a result, an additional singles match was held, and Huilan won again. In the tennis doubles match between John's and Taowu, John's won both groups. One was 2-0, and the other was 2-1.</p>

<p>The Haixing Women's Basketball Team played a friendly match with Great China last night at the</p>
<p>Chinese Basketball Hall. As a result, Haixing overwhelmingly won with a score of 51-16. Haixing has many strong players. Yesterday, Guo Xiaoping, Chen Yingrui, and Wang Chunxiang served as forwards, while Guan Jin and Shen, the three women, firmly guarded the rear. Their strength was extremely formidable. Guo and Chen were as agile as ever, and Miss Wang was even better than before. From the start of the battle, the score soared. Although Great China's skills have also greatly improved, they still felt inferior when playing against Haixing and were in a trailing position throughout the match. At the end of the fourth quarter, Haixing won with a score of 51-16.</p>

Guo Zhixin's 400-meter hurdles and Chen Shuqing's 50-meter time of 7.4 seconds were very close to Jiangnan University's 7.3 seconds.

<p>Three Major Inter-Departmental Football Battles</p>
<p>Shen Bao Express defeats Shi Bao Times 2-0</p>
<p>Shi Shi Kai Xin defeats Xin Wen News 1-0</p>
<p>Chen Bao Xing Fen defeats Min Bao People's 1-0</p>
<p>A huge athletic field has now become a place for creating laughter,</p>
<p>a source of joy. If you eat too much for lunch, you might as well go there to watch a football game. I guarantee that in less than two hours, you will laugh until you are hungry. This is truly, "Jokes come every year, but there are more this year." Wait a minute: the six-newspaper inter-departmental competition met again at the City First Stadium yesterday, killing each other until people were overturned and horses were upended, and the sun and moon lost their light, until the world was dark. Only then did they cease their drums, take a cold breath, and go home to eat dinner.</p>
<h3 id="e213">申報 vs. 時報 <a href="#e213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>Golden Flower Pavilion Opens the Door of Opportunity First</p>
<p>With the sound of horns and drums, the warhorses leap forward, *Shen Bao*'s frontline is greatly invigorated. Golden Flower Pavilion, carrying A Dou (a reference to someone seen as a burden), brandishes his spear and charges into the enemy ranks. Shao Yizhi launches a flying kick, but unexpectedly Li Zunyong parries it. The original attack is deflected. The Golden Flower Pavilion re-enters the fray, but Liu Jianwu is unable to block the attack. It's forced into a corner kick, which Golden Flower Pavilion delivers to the center. Shao Yizhi's head is bloodied. Xue Xiao-fu orders a counter-attack. Fatty Qian Hua uses his immense belly as a rattan shield to block the cannonballs. With a resounding bang, it shakes the entire stadium. Veteran Sun Daosheng launches a central attack and, upon reaching a suitable location, secretly sends a ball to Golden Flower Pavilion, who sneaks it into the goal. Little Zhang of *Shi Bao* is so enraged that flames shoot from his nostrils and smoke billows from all seven orifices.</p>
<p>Teng Shugu's Roar Shakes Heaven and Earth</p>
<p>Old Teng of *Shi Bao* is not one to forgive. Seeing the first stronghold lost, he is filled with anger and indignation. He launches two counter-attacks, but achieves no success. Shao Yizhi loses a shot in the rear defense. Jiang Zongdao takes advantage and sends a kick, while Ren Naijing and Teng Shugu provide backup support. Under the encouragement of Zunyong's wife and the charming cheers of the sister-in-law from the small room, his courage increases and he sends the ball out of danger like a whirlwind. Lei Xiao-fu throws the ball illegally, losing a good opportunity. Old Teng can't contain his anger and roars, like an ape howling in a desolate valley or a cat shrieking on a rooftop, startling all who hear it. Before the echoes fade, it's time for a break.</p>
<p>Sun Daosheng Captures Fang La Single-Handedly</p>
<p>During the break, Li Zunyong is greatly admired by everyone. *Shen Bao* is able to repeatedly emerge from danger unscathed, and General Li deserves great credit. Mrs. Li provides meticulous care, and the sister-in-law from the small room is even more effusive in her praise. Before long, the close combat begins again. *Shi Bao*'s counter-attacks become even fiercer. Lu Erqiang and his comrades strengthen the second line of defense. Fatty Qian Hua charges out from the waistline, his bravery unmatched. No matter what cannons or tanks you have, don't even think about crossing the line! Li Zunyong even displays a sign that says, "This road is impassable!" As a result, Old Teng suffers greatly. Although he uses all his strength and sweats profusely, he can't get a chance. Jiang Zongdao can only groan in despair. Just as the situation is at a deadlock, Sun Daosheng, single-handedly (because one hand is injured and cannot be used on the field, so he has to be "single-handed"), dribbles deep, breaking through three barriers in a row, and shoots powerfully, successfully scoring a goal. After this, the Four Great Warriors of *Shi Bao*—Shao, Jiang, Teng, and Lei—repeatedly try to retaliate, but they have no chance to hug their regrets until the end of the game.</p>

<p>Evenly Matched Blood Battle</p>
<p>The *Current Affairs* vs. *News* match follows *Shen Bao* and *Shi Bao*. With a fresh style, it naturally has a different flavor. *News*'s forwards are good at dribbling, while *Current Affairs*'s rear defense is strong. Each has its strengths, and neither can beat the other. During the ten minutes, they sprint back and forth. Forty-four muscular legs without curves, intricately changing positions, are thrilling to watch. Jiang Zhongyi and Shen Meizhen are the most dangerous players on the *News* team. *Current Affairs*'s rear defense must be wary of their "stealthy, dim, hidden, and waiting" tactics. If they're even slightly careless, they'll regret the loss, so *Current Affairs* defends against them as if they were thieves and fears them like tigers.</p>
<p>Jiang Xiangqing Serves as Executioner</p>
<p>Xia Kaiming is a man of few words, but when he speaks, he startles people. Pei Yuan doesn't fly, but when he does, he soars to the sky. Zhu Yunguang kicks a lotus slipper bud. Sun Chu-yuan conceals himself, passes through the flower-filled path. Li Zhuozhen adds an extra kick, gradually getting into good form. The penalty area for *News* is becoming a scene of much activity. Jiang Jianhou forgets that he is on the battlefield and actually uses his hand to move the ball with his foot. Qu Qu, one call, penalty kick determined. Jiang Xiangqing steps forward. Shao Bonan crouches and waits. The wife of a certain reporter silently prays, "God, if this ball doesn't go in, I will go to church to attend Mass for two months." But the situation has become a tiger that's impossible to dismount from, so he can't stop. The old gun sweeps horizontally, and the ball goes into the gate early. But soon, Old Jiang is bumped and injured, the war suspended for three minutes. The Jiangs took the pain into the battle and made a show of pain.</p>

<p>Those Who Aren't Convinced by Our Ideals, Please Step Forward</p>
<p>As the inter-departmental competitions of various newspapers come to an end, our all-sports reporter united team is launched in response. However, in our ideals, we are only willing to fight to the death and determine the winner with the following four teams. We sincerely hope that our ideals become reality, not a mere bubble. If there is a response, please feel free to send it to the sports column of any newspaper, and you will surely receive a satisfactory answer.</p>

<h3 id="e216">*Xinwen Bao* Relies on Old Tricks <a href="#e216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>In the second half, *Xinwen Bao* is determined to take revenge. Pei Shunyuan exhorts his men, saying that if they can recover the lost territory, they will hold a grand dance party to celebrate. However, things don't always go as planned. Numerous attacks are unsuccessful. Shen Meizhen is closely guarded and unable to move an inch, like a dragon trapped in shallow water or a bird in a cage. Qiu Mingsheng, in the precarious situation, is injured and taken off the field. Manager Yan Duhe personally consoles him. Helpless, he bravely returns to the field to continue fighting. At the instant, the retreat drums sounds, the players are panting as they leave the field.</p>

<p>Sworn to Fight to the Death, No Surrender</p>
<p>*Chen Bao*, with its elite troops, harbors great ambitions to win. *Min Bao* is not a weak nation, especially since Wu Zhongyi and Jiang Hongjiao are all top figures and fear nothing. The fierce battle begins. *Min Bao* is immediately in a difficult situation, but the soldiers in the rear are high in morale. Under the hail of bullets, they do not retreat even slightly. Wu Zhongyi first makes a will, moving the entire army. Everyone is willing to be a decapitated general. Therefore, the close combat is extremely fierce. Limbs fly wildly, and stray bullets whiz past. For seven minutes, the front line doesn't budge. Although *Chen Bao* is in a superior position, it can only wail in vain given the stubborn resistance.</p>
<h3 id="e218">Jin Xi's Kick Reveals the Outcome <a href="#e218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>Helpless, Chen Jinyuan breaks through a bloody path. Qin Zuyang strictly investigates smuggling and tax evasion. Xu Zexiang skims profits in the process. Veteran Qu Yue stares wildly, charging into the fray on his mount. Zhang Zhen turns his head, detouring to gather his troops. Unfortunately, his horse stumbles. The beacon fires of the pass is in critical danger. Wu Zhongyi and Yu Deyuan become entangled. Wu Jingshu and Zhang Zhen even come to blows. Jin Xi flies in out of nowhere, shooting diagonally at the door, unexpectedly producing the desired effect. Zhou Yinxin shakes his head and sighs, at a loss for words.</p>
<h3 id="e219">Intense Battle in the Twilight <a href="#e219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>After the break, they change sides and fight again. *Chen Bao* still wants to add fuel to the fire by scoring another goal, but *Min Bao* is eager for revenge. Their rear defense is fierce, and their front line is formidable. Offense and defense are even more spirited than in the first half. Jiang Hongjiao seizes every opportunity, putting in extra effort. Xu Zexiang is dripping with sweat, panting softly. Zhou Fuming is even more flamboyant, like clouds and tumbling weeds, so busy that he is flustered and distraught. Fortunately, his forehead shines and no inappropriate things happen in the palace. In the misty twilight, it is truly a great melee.</p>

<p>The Six Roads Old Men's Army met again at the Municipal Sports Field yesterday afternoon. Our newspaper's entire force gradually set off for the front line at 3:30 PM. The commanding generals also personally came to the battlefield. You look at me, and I look at you, shaking hands and smiling. That kind of happy mood and nervous courage is truly wonderful. Thousands of fans are constantly crowding around, surrounding the vast playing field like a human wall, almost impossible to find a gap to squeeze into. Commander-in-chief Zhang Longhai blew the silver horn, and the *Shen Bao* and *Shi Bao* armies began their close combat. Everyone gritted their teeth and fought hard, without showing any mercy.</p>
<h3 id="e221">Wounded Players <a href="#e221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>Football is definitely not a fun game. After repeated fierce battles, even those with copper skin and iron bones cannot avoid scratches and bruises. For example, before our army set out yesterday, almost nine out of ten brothers were injured. Fortunately, they were all veterans who didn't desert at the last minute. Sun Daosheng's left hand was bandaged to his chest by the doctor, and only his right hand could move. People called him the One-Armed General. Zhu Mingxin's legs were covered in scars, but he still exerted himself despite the pain. Xie Hong was old and calm, unafraid of pain, truly extraordinary. Fatty Qian Hua was quite lucky and never fell, giving off the air of a Tumbler. Golden Flower Pavilion's demeanor was calm, like an old silkworm. Huang Jiping's belly was red from stray bullets. Some said that if she were pregnant, there would be a risk of miscarriage. Fortunately, the nursing care of Ye Changlie, who was filling in as an obstetrician, kept her safe and sound.</p>
<h3 id="e222">Improved Skills <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>After four battles, our army has made great progress in both internal and external offense and defense.</p>
<p>The first line takes an offensive stance, while the second and third lines take a defensive stance. The line is very solid. Ma Chonggan comes to every battle and says, "The current formation has indeed improved a lot." In fact, it may be an exaggeration, but we believe that our army's firm, brave, and unified spirit will lead to success in the future.</p>
<h3 id="e223">Triumphant Victory <a href="#e223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>The blood battle between the two armies was filled with smoke and dust. As a result, we were fortunate to have the allied forces concede, and we won two games in a row. Some of the spectators cheering for us on the field said, "*Shen Bao* is indeed an old hand." Others said, "*Shen Bao*'s old men aren't old." We are very grateful and ashamed for this encouragement.</p>

<h3 id="e224">Recent Reforms in Elementary and Secondary School Curriculum and Educational Administration in Soviet Russia (1) by Zhu Zhensun <a href="#e224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>I. The Failure of School Education in Soviet Russia</p>
<p>Since the promulgation of compulsory education laws and the implementation of revised curricula, Soviet Russia has indeed achieved considerable success in elementary and secondary school education. This is acknowledged by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Soviet Russia. However, Soviet Russian schools still suffer from many shortcomings. The most important of these is the inability of schools to provide basic knowledge in subjects such as biology, physics, chemistry, mathematics, national languages, geography, and other subjects necessary for preparation for admission to higher and specialized schools. The main reasons for this failure are the inadequacy of the curriculum (especially the curriculum for higher grades), poor classroom teaching methods, lack of guidance from the education commission and its agencies, and the lack of rigorous training in schools. In addition, there is another shortcoming, namely, the inability to unify the school system. As a result, elementary and secondary schools often fail to meet the needs of compulsory subjects for admission to higher education.</p>
<p>II. Recent Revisions of the Curriculum</p>
<p>In view of the shortcomings in schools, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Soviet Russia passed a resolution on September 5, 1931, to improve the secondary school curriculum. Since then, the curriculum of elementary and secondary schools, especially the curriculum of elementary schools, has been considerably improved, and the content of the curriculum has become more substantial than before. However, the Central Committee found that there were still certain shortcomings in the curriculum, so it finally proposed to revise the curriculum for the fifth, sixth, and seventh grades. They believe that the curriculum for these three grades has the following shortcomings:</p>
<p>(1) The amount of content is too much, and as a result, students can only quickly acquire a small amount of superficial knowledge from the subjects. For example, this is especially true of the part of solid geometry in the seventh grade mathematics subject.</p>
<p>(2) The teaching materials are not consistent with each other. For example, the teaching materials for mathematics and drawing, as well as the teaching materials for mathematics, physics, chemistry, and manual labor, are all inconsistent. Therefore, the geometry knowledge required for drawing assignments in the fifth grade is not taught until the sixth grade. Furthermore, in higher grades, physics often lacks the necessary foundation of mathematical knowledge.</p>
<p>(3) Some subjects are oversimplified. For example, citing Newton's laws in physics and explaining the structure of cells in biology are often the cases. Furthermore, in geography, students generally do not have sufficient opportunities to observe maps. In social science, many political errors often occur.</p>
<p>(4) Social science often does not pay attention to historical facts, so there is little description of the land and social evolution of mankind in the past. There is also a major shortcoming in that they have not yet prepared a historical curriculum.</p>
<p>As a result, the Central Committee of the Communist Party recommended to the Education Committee of the Soviet Russian Republic that it revise all the curricula of elementary and secondary schools starting from January 1, 1933, so as to provide students with a systematic knowledge of the three "R"s (reading, writing, and arithmetic). These curriculum revisions are based on the following principles:</p>
<p>(A) The teaching materials for mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology, whether in terms of scope or nature, should be suitable for the age of the relevant class. The teaching materials for many subjects should be reduced so that a solid foundation can be laid in these basic training areas.</p>
<p>(B) The teaching materials for mathematics, physics, and chemistry, as well as the teaching materials for history, social science, and linguistics, should be consistent with each other.</p>
<p>(C) The teaching of local languages, mathematics, social science, physics, chemistry, and natural science should, to the extent possible, be related to the important issues of socialist organization.</p>
<p>(D) Special emphasis should be placed on historical facts in social science, national language, literature, geography, and other subjects.</p>
<p>(E) Increase the teaching time for mathematics so that students can acquire sufficient knowledge in this training area to meet the needs of admission to higher education.</p>
<p>(F) In physics, Newton's laws should be explained in detail. In biology, the human body and the concept of cells should be developed. In addition, a more systematic chemistry curriculum should be established. When teaching geography, emphasis must be placed on knowledge of maps (especially knowledge of maps of the Soviet Union), as well as basic knowledge of topographic geography and economic geography. The geography of capitalist countries should also be included in the curriculum.</p>
<p>(G) At least one foreign language should be added in secondary schools.</p>
<p>(H) Improve the teaching methods for national language and social science.</p>
<p>(L) In the subjects of social science, literature, national language, geography, and history, the national culture of the people in the anti-Soviet Union and its literature, art, and science should be introduced.</p>
<p>(I) In vocational schools, emphasis should be placed on manual labor. In the teaching plan, the production work in industry should be integrated with theory.</p>
<p>In addition to the above, it is also necessary to have the elements of technological knowledge, for example, the minimum essential knowledge of electricity, the knowledge of the application of electricity in machinery and chemical industry. Furthermore, in order to gain practical knowledge, students must also visit electrical factories and must have the ability to use tools, wood, and metal to work.</p>

<h3 id="e225">A Supplement to the Theory of Mutual Subjugation between "Writing" and "Teaching" <a href="#e225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>

<p>"Writing books is all for the sake of rice and grain, I worry about my frugal belly and lofty talk. In case I drift away in the sea of writing, people will ask where to sign my name without sorrow."</p>
<p>Cao Liwu collected Gong Ding'an's sentences</p>
<p>Teaching for ten years, no one does not shake their heads and sigh, hence Mr. Xia Yuanzun's saying "I would rather die early than be a teacher." Selling manuscripts for ten years, no one does not shake their heads and sigh, hence Mr. Zhuan Donghua's theory of "this road does not work." I have been teaching for thirteen years, and selling manuscripts for almost ten years. Exhausted, I have thoughts of returning home. Yesterday, I read Mr. Yu Dafu's "Writing Books and Teaching," which stirred my heart. I feel that his "theory of mutual subjugation between writing and teaching" comes from the bottom of his heart, and every sentence "first finds my heart." However, from the perspective of someone like me who has carried both burdens, the way of mutual subjugation does not lie in the professions of "writing" and "teaching" themselves, but outside of themselves.</p>
<p>"Writing" and "teaching" are close to the esteemed title of "freelancer." Is the profession really "free"? One must also ask the editor of "Free Talk" if the discussion is really "free." We are likely comrades: having the name of "free" but not the reality of "free." A writer, with accumulated ideas and experiences, wants to write a book, collecting materials for five years, organizing materials for two years, then grinding ink and unfolding paper, drafting for two years, and revising for one year, and then it is completed. Wouldn't that be great? A teacher, after years of research and creating new ideas, then ascends the stage to lecture, going from deep to shallow, encountering sources everywhere, making stubborn stones nod their heads and swimming fish look up. Wouldn't that be a joyous thing? Freelancers must often have such dreams, but what is the reality? The bookstore owner limits you to completing a 200,000-word book in three months. Feel free to copy and paste, no need to be original. The school owner asks you to teach for twenty-four hours a week, with seven or eight different courses, preparing on the spot and selling them immediately, with no stock left at home. The books written and taught by freelancers are nothing more than commodities on the market: the more you produce, the faster you produce, the more generous the boss, and only then can you make a "rice and grain." As for whether "inspiration" and "poetic sentiment" are permanently lost, that is not within the boss's calculations. Therefore, there are few times when "writing" and "teaching" mutually subjugate each other, and many times when "writing" and "teaching" are subjugated at the same time. Under the power of capitalism, the breath of freelancers is also too short!</p>
<p>In my experience, if you take teaching as the center of gravity for making a living and writing as a way to express your interests, then while teaching is certainly torturous, writing is relatively able to proceed gradually according to your own plans and complete a satisfactory work. Or, if you take writing as the center of gravity for making a living and teaching as a way to express your interests, teaching for only two or three hours a week, then when the inspiration strikes, the whole class can be silent and still, like eating ginseng fruit, with your whole body feeling comfortable. Or, change your plans and entrust the center of gravity for making a living to another profession, treating both "writing" and "teaching" as hobbies. Outside of selling manuscripts for稿費 and teaching for salary, there is room for free creation. Instead of mutually subjugating each other, they generate each other, and the achievements will surely be even more impressive. Mr. Zhou Zuoren said, "It is best for everyone not to take creation as a specialized career, but to have other skills and other professions besides creation. This will be even better for literature. If you rely solely on literature as a means of making a living, then if such people increase, it will inevitably lead to the depravity of literature." (The Origins and Development of Chinese New Literature) It can be seen that taking "writing" and "teaching" as a side business is another great way to preserve "inspiration" and "poetic sentiment."</p>
<p>John Stuart Mill worked as a clerk in the East India Company, serving for thirty years, and in his spare time, he wrote such a great masterpiece as Logic. Sometimes I want to learn how to repair cars, sometimes I want to learn to be a doctor, sometimes I want to learn to be a barber, and sometimes I even want to be a doorman for some great person, just hoping that I don't have to rely on the "writing" and "teaching" freelancing to make a living.</p>
<p>In conclusion, intellectuals have already reached the end of the road!</p>
<h3 id="e226">Killing the Goose to Get the Eggs <a href="#e226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>by Jingzi</p>
<p>A fellow villager came and said that the province is now levying a national salvation donation, totaling five million yuan, with each county being allocated tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands, and a deadline for payment. The so-called allocation is to allocate it to the general farmers according to the land tax. However, at present, every two acres of land tax in this province has additional taxes and donations reaching more than forty yuan, which means that the additional tax exceeds the regular tribute by more than ten times. Thinking of the huge number of "five million yuan," my heart feels inexplicably heavy. I don't know how many tragedies of selling children and daughters will be enacted under this number of five million. But if the donation is really for "saving the country," who can say that selling children and daughters is not necessary?</p>
<p>However, Hunan is perhaps slightly better than Sichuan.</p>
<p>According to the Sichuan Monthly Report compiled by the Bank of China: In March of this year, the 20th Army began to levy the grain tax for the 49th year, requiring it to be collected within 40 days; before the 21st year, the 24th Army levied four times a year. Last autumn, from the 36th year to the 38th year, it also levied a national defense donation of 25 yuan. From September to November, it also levied from the 30th year to the 41st year, and in December, it also levied from the 42nd year to the 44th year. In February of this year, it also levied the two years of the 45th and 46th years; the 28th Army stipulated that grain should be levied once every two months, that is, six years a year. Starting in March of this year, it also began to levy the grain tax for the 62nd and 63rd years and set a deadline for collection, with an additional levy for those who exceed the deadline, which is said to be "to warn the weary." Levying grain tax six times a year, and it is still only the 23rd year of the Republic of China, but the grain tax has already been levied to the 63rd year. I truly admire the spirit of the Chinese military in "killing the goose to get the golden eggs."</p>
<p>I heard that in the provinces of Shaanxi and Gansu, taxes and donations are used to exploit the people. Farmers who own land are even more miserable than general tenant farmers and hired laborers. Because the exploitation of taxes and donations for tenant farmers and hired laborers is relatively less, while general owner-farmers bear the name of "owning land" and are fundamentally unable to cope with the heavy taxes and donations. Therefore, they all lead their sons and daughters, posting the land deeds on the door, willingly wandering and drifting in all directions. The ancient poem "Sell new silk in February, sell new grain in May" is generally considered to be "healing the sore in front of the eyes, but cutting out the flesh of the heart." What about now? Now there is a chorus of selling children and daughters, and the tragedy of exchanging children for food is raging like a tiger. How can the people not be poor? How can the rural economy not become increasingly bankrupt?</p>
<p>The government is now loudly calling for rescuing the countryside, and some people even advocate that China should imitate the American method of rescuing the countryside. I think, instead of talking loftily about relief, the first step is still better to prohibit "killing the goose to get the eggs!"</p>
<h3 id="e227">Three Days <a href="#e227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>— Wu</p>
<p>The third day after the good day, the guests gradually dispersed.</p>
<p>I also went to the factory to work. I left the warm, soft new bed and the shy new bride early in the morning. I told her softly that I was going to work. She frowned and didn't say anything. I guessed she had something on her mind, reluctant to part, but I also felt she was annoyed with me, complaining about me. She hadn't said a word to me in three days. Was it shyness?: :</p>
<p>So I didn't say much more. I put on my usual work clothes</p>
<p>, put the leftover rice from last night into a box as usual, came out, and entrusted it to Sister Zhang downstairs, asking her to accompany the bride. She was new here, unfamiliar with everything, and also a bit lonely. Sister Zhang also smiled knowingly:</p>
<p>"Go ahead with peace of mind. No one will mistreat your bride.</p>
<p>Who would steal her away?"</p>
<p>"I'm just worried about you, afraid you'll steal her." As I</p>
<p>joked with her, I came out feeling light and refreshed, my heart warm and full of joy. The men and women going to work on the road were very crowded. I felt they were all smiling at me and teasing me. I am the happiest person in the world now. I am thirty-two years old this year, and I have been single since my father and mother passed away. How lonely these past ten years have been. But now I have a woman, and the loneliness and hardship of the past ten years have finally been rewarded. I am the happiest now: : And besides, the bride has such a fair, oval face, her eyes sparkling and charming, she is not bad looking at all.</p>
<p>I walked into the factory, and only today did I realize how</p>
<p>dark the factory was, how complicated the machines were, and how noisy the machine sounds were. I felt somewhat estranged from everything. When my colleagues saw me coming, they all asked questions, long and short, with smiling faces.</p>
<p>"Hey, how's the wife?"</p>
<p>"Original goods?"</p>
<p>"Happy, didn't sleep at night?"</p>
<p>"Reluctant to separate? Is the taste good?"</p>
<p>These kinds of interesting words fell on me like raindrops.</p>
<p>I actually became the center of attention among them. I am usually not paid much attention to. I am very grateful to them, so I greeted them cheerfully. That foreman also came over and patted me on the shoulder today, relaxing his stern face. The gentlemen walked by, heard others teasing me, and did not interfere, just smiled at me. How happy is this? A man with a wife is so respected.</p>
<p>I am thirty-two this year, and the woman is only twenty-one. I am eleven years older than her. As I worked, I heard someone saying in my ear: Now you have a family, and people respect you. You are eleven years older than the woman, you should cherish her and give her a good life. You have to work hard, you have to save more money, and soon you will have children. You have to work hard: : You are eleven years older than the woman: :</p>
<p>So I decided from today onwards to exert all my</p>
<p>strength, do the work of two people alone, and ask the gentlemen to give me double wages. When I go back after work in the evening, I will also look for something else to do.</p>
<p>How long the days in the factory are. Only today did I</p>
<p>realize how slowly time passes. As usual, it is twelve hours, but I thought a year had passed. I don't know how my bride is doing at home. I heard that she can cook and do everything herself. I thought about going back today, and someone has already cooked the meal and is waiting for me, how delicious that would be. I have a home now: It was not easy to wait until the factory blew the whistle for the end of work. I squeezed out of the crowd in a hurry. My heart was beating very fast along the way. I think this is because of happiness. My heart has lost its normal state.</p>
<p>Walking back to the workshop, the people in the alley all looked at me with strange</p>
<p>eyes, as if they wanted to search for something on me, staring at me from head to toe, confirming my back. Could something have happened to me, to my home? Someone should be cooking in my home and waiting for me.</p>
<p>At the door, I met Sister Zhang. As soon as she saw me,</p>
<p>she took my hand, seemingly trembling a little. Stepping through the front door, I said, "Where is she?"</p>
<p>"Her? I went out for half a day this afternoon. I just</p>
<p>came back and she was already gone."</p>
<p>"Gone. I searched everywhere, but there's no trace of her.</p>
<p>Someone saw her leaving with a bag of clothes. Go and see, the new room has been messed up. She ran away!"</p>
<p>Ran away. Is there such a thing? I ran up the stairs,</p>
<p>kicked open the door, and sure enough, I saw clothes scattered messily on the bed and on the floor, and the chest open. She no longer lives in the room. I felt my limbs go weak, and everything went dark before my eyes. I went to sit on a</p>
<p>chair, and the chair fell with my body. Now I am alone again, with no relatives to turn to, and I feel that I no longer have the courage to live.</p>
<h3 id="e228">Carrot Top <a href="#e228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>— Translated by JUUESKENARQ Lin Dao</p>
<p>Red Cheeks One (continued)</p>
<p>However, this time someone answered him:</p>
<p>"Yes, so what?"</p>
<p>Carrot Top shrunk back into the quilt.</p>
<p>Mr. Inspector appeared again, he appeared suddenly.</p>
<p>Two</p>
<p>"That's right," Wei Ao said, "I did kiss you, Maso;" You can admit this, because you did nothing wrong.</p>
<p>I kissed you on the forehead, but Carrot Top, who has fallen at a young age, cannot understand this. He does not know that this is a pure and innocent kiss, a kiss from a father to his son. He doesn't know that I love you as much as I love my own son. If you want, you can say like a brother. He will spread rumors everywhere tomorrow, this idiot! When Wei Ao Long said this, his voice trembled with anger, but Carrot Top pretended to be asleep. But he still perked up his head to listen.</p>
<p>Masao held his breath and listened to the inspector's words. Although he felt that his words were very natural, he trembled all over, as if fearing some mysterious revelation. Wei Ao Long continued, trying to keep his voice down. These were some vague words, some fleeting syllables. Carrot Top, who was lying in bed and dared not turn over, moved his waist slightly and unconsciously came closer. At this time, he couldn't hear anything. His attention was excited to the extreme. He felt that his two ears had indeed become two holes, and that the holes had expanded to become like funnels: but no sound fell into these funnels.</p>
<p>He remembered the same feeling of effort he often had when eavesdropping outside the door. At that time, while listening, he leaned his eyes on the keyhole to peek, wishing he could enlarge the keyhole and pull the things he wanted to steal closer to see clearly, as if hooking them with an iron hook. But at this time, he really heard Wei Ao Long say again:</p>
<p>"Yes, my love is pure, pure, and that's what that idiot can't understand!"</p>
<p>Finally, the inspector bent down with a shadow-like tenderness and kissed Maso on the forehead. The mustache under his chin stroked Maso's forehead like a writing brush. Then he straightened up and walked outside. Carrot Top followed him closely with his eyes, watching him pass between the rows of beds. When Wei Ao Long's hand touched someone else's pillow, the awakened person sighed heavily and turned over to the other side. (To be continued)</p>

When the wool market opened, it immediately retreated to within the 70 yuan mark. After opening, it rose slightly with the foreign exchange market. HSBC's listing was level for British currency and up 0.125 for US currency. After the announcement, the foreign exchange market hardened, and the gold market fell. Later, because the domestic market tightened, Bombay initially telegraphed a drop of 3.12 annas. People's hearts turned stable, and short positions were quickly covered. Although it recovered by 2 annas later, the result still rose, and the cash price was increased by 58 yuan. The spread for June/July swap was about 13 yuan.

<p>News of a Bad Opening Trends Downward, News of a Ceasefire in the Afternoon Creates Panic, Trading is Booming, Troop Cuts Reach a High Price</p>
<p>Yesterday's market at the Chinese Securities Exchange was more turbulent than expected. Because</p>
<p>news reports indicated that the situation was deteriorating and that the so-called peace talks seemed to be breaking down, people inevitably became panicked again. And because the futures trading for this month had reached the last day, the opening this morning initially turned into a squeeze on the short side. The prices of various bond markets all returned to a small number of jiao, and the trend seemed to be downward. Only because there were many transactions, the closing was delayed until 12:15. At that time, the Reuters telegram had arrived, informing that the Sino-Japanese ceasefire had been realized. The atmosphere on the field was extremely tense. Short sellers were extremely panicked, and various gangs were buying in. Market prices soared. The 20-series bonds surged by 3 yuan, and the rest mostly rose by about 1 to 2 yuan. The momentum of the rise and the amount of demand were truly rare in recent times, and the sudden surge was unstoppable. The amount of trading was also unmatched. The number of transactions in the morning two sessions reached more than 16.1 million. The afternoon opening was delayed until 5:00 before the auction began. The market situation was still extremely tense. Troop reductions continued to rise by 1 yuan, and troop cuts also rose by 1 yuan.

<p>The yarn market initially fell and then rose, the situation was very chaotic. There were several changes in one day</p>
<p>, which shows that the long and short sides were fighting hard. However, the sellers relied on large inventories to short, but the factories were still losing money due to the high price of raw materials. In the afternoon, it was reported that public bonds had risen and that there was a ceasefire in North China. Buyers were active and the market suddenly rose sharply.</p>

<p>The Human Biao market opened in the morning. Because the previous day's market was depressed, the market continued to trend downward. Each day fell by 70 to 80 jiao to 1 yuan. The market soared after opening in the afternoon.</p>
<p>The field was short of sellers, and the buying trend was strong. Due to the peaceful news in the situation, each month rose by more than 2 yuan. Gradually, they fell back.

<p>The cotton market is trending stronger because US cotton has rebounded and the inventory of cotton in this port is gradually</p>
<p>weakening, resulting in a lack of chips for delivery. Major players are unanimously bullish, and the prices in various producing areas are higher than those in Shanghai. Therefore, there are very few sellers. The future situation still depends on foreign cotton.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the U.S. cotton market was mixed and uncertain. Initially, prices fell due to favorable weather conditions, but later rose due to buying by manufacturers.

<p>Rice Market Steady with Slight Firmness</p>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the supply from various sources was around 20 to 30 lots. Initially, the supply was relatively scarce, leading to a tight market. Later, due to limited outflow, the situation inevitably turned sluggish. As a result, the market became steady with a slight firmness. For example, the price of Su Tong helped to raise the price, while Chang and Nan Gang remained stable. Qingjiao, Guangfengsong, Jiangxi Lian, and other high-priced thin rice were purchased by Yantai and Weihai. Those from Zhongguan mostly went to Longkou, totaling more than one thousand bags. The market price, except for the higher-priced ones that were slightly brighter, remained stable. Cun Jian and Yinbian Yuan remained unchanged, while Yang Jian was relatively weak.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, the supply from various sources down the river was more than 20 lots. White japonica rice was actively bought by chemical stores, and the situation in the surrounding villages changed slightly. The market was slightly firm, rising by one 角. High-quality thin japonica early rice was attractive, while medium quality rice was stable. The price of Jian-shaped rice saw an increase, but Ke Jian still lacked transactions. Arrivals were strong and sales were acceptable, but prices showed a weakening trend.</p>
<h3 id="e247">Coarse Red Rice Exceptionally Popular <a href="#e247" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c247" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">247</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, foreign rice and Fujian rice were still active, and there were inquiries in this street. However, foreign firms were unwilling to sell easily. Later, a warehouse released 1,000 small bags, with high-quality goods still priced at 7.7 yuan and general goods at 7.65 yuan, which were handled by Fujian merchants and local merchants. Ke Xian from Fujian was very active, but as the number of arrivals gradually increased, the growers were also eager to sell, so the market price could not be raised. The entire day saw the sale of 500 bags of Jiangxi machine-milled rice, priced at 8.5 to 8.2 yuan, and 135 bags of Ji Yuan rice, priced at 8.7 yuan. 240 bags of Hunan machine-pressed oil rice were priced at 8.8 to 8.62 yuan. Hunan coarse red rice was even more favored by Fujian merchants, with 3,000 bags sold throughout the city. Prices were raised by 5 分, opening at 7 yuan, 7.05 to 7.1 yuan. 304 bags of machine-milled Jing were priced at 7.75 yuan, 400 bags of Jing were priced at 7.22 to 6.95 yuan, and 260 bags of machine-milled red rice were priced at 8.1 to 7.97 yuan. Among them, 200 bags of Hunan Jing were sent to Wenzhou and Taizhou, while the rest were purchased by Fujian merchants.</p>

<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market, the market for various months was generally calm. As the price of foreign wheat was only about 3, 4, 5, or 6 角, most people remained cautious after the opening price. Buyers inside and outside the industry were not active, and manufacturers were also mostly waiting and seeing. Therefore, the prices of distant months were slightly lower than the previous day by 5 厘 to 1 分 due to weak buying interest. Until the afternoon opening, the market suddenly saw a turnaround, as it was rumored that a compromise had been reached in Tianjin and Peiping, and that China and Japan could achieve peace. Therefore, the actual sales force in the north absorbed Gu Li in the market. In addition, the spot price in Tianjin was reported to be good at 2 or 3 分, with gun vehicles opening at 2.59 yuan and warships opening at 2.57 yuan. As a result, most people were optimistic, and the transactions for various months became very active. However, a large factory sold more than 100,000 bags, so the increase was not very strong. As a result, this month was up 7.5 厘 from the previous day, June was up 1 分, July and August were up 7.5 厘, September was up 2.5 厘, and October was up 1 分.</p>

<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the wheat futures market, the market for various months became sluggish again. Although the price of foreign wheat was only about 3, 4, 5, or 6 角, the sellers were not active and the buyers were also waiting and seeing, so there were very few transactions. Only July and August saw slight transactions, with price differences of 1 or 2 分 from the previous day. Until the afternoon opening, there were still no transactions for May and June, while transactions for July, August, and September were active. As a compromise was rumored in Tianjin and Peiping, flour sales improved, and the wheat market also picked up. Therefore, the opening price was good, but as the weather was still favorable, the increase was not very strong. As a result, July rose by 3 分, August rose by 1 分, and September rose by 2 分. The rest were not opened.</p>

<p>Improved Varieties Showing Great Results: Old varieties of cocoons are hard to fetch good prices and undergo sudden changes. Silkworms are all on the shelves and there is not much impact. New cocoons are launched one after another. At first, early indigenous varieties of cocoons were prevalent in the market.</p>
<p>With thin and inferior bodies, cocoon prices only opened at 25 to 30 yuan. In the past two days,</p>
<p>cocoons have been getting better. Improved high-quality cocoons initially opened at 35 to 36 yuan, and now have risen to 40 yuan.</p>

<p>The first model improved silkworm area incubated more than 30,000 sheets of improved seeds this year. There are also more instructors than in other regions. New cocoons are being put on the shelves, and cocoon production is very good.</p>
<p>After the opening of Toupeng Puyi Kanshan Minxin and other cocoon houses, the improved cocoon</p>
<p>bodies were of good quality, and the cocoon price initially opened at 29 yuan, followed by 35 to 36 yuan. Yesterday, the highest price opened at 40 yuan.</p>

<p>The cultivated indigenous silkworms are about 10 days earlier than foreign silkworms. The silkworm season is quite good and seven-tenths of the year can be expected. Cocoon houses are opened. Initially, due to the small amount of arrivals, and the fact that most of the indigenous cocoons are thin-skinned</p>
<p>, the cocoon price only opened at 24 to 25 yuan. In the past two days, foreign silkworm cocoons have been put on the shelves</p>
<p>, the market has gradually become prosperous, the cocoon quality is also excellent, and the price is also expected to be high. Improved high-quality cocoons open at 34-35 to 37-38 yuan, and ordinary ones are pulled at 30 yuan.</p>

<p>Cocoon houses have been open for three days. The goods arrived on the first day were not good, and the cocoon price only opened at 26-27 yuan. In the past two days, more improved high-quality cocoons have arrived, and the cocoon price has risen from 3</p>
<p>14-15 yuan to 37-38 yuan.</p>

<p>good, and new cocoons are being launched one after another, with excellent results. A special call was made to the financial community</p>
<p>Silk cocoon merchants form a cocoon collection committee, with six committee members recommended in each district, raising huge sums of money (100,000 in Xiaoshan and 60,000 in Lin'an) to rent cocoon houses and collect cocoons in each district. It is reported that the two model areas are expected to collect 45,000 to 46,000 dan of fresh cocoons this year. They have all set off separately.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the local foreign silk market was sluggish as the price of silk in New York and Lyon was flat.</p>
<p>The price of Japanese silk in Yokohama was only equivalent to 746-47 yuan in national currency, and it was difficult for the price of raw silk in Shanghai to rise. As new cocoons have already been launched, Chinese silk merchants did not dare to insist, and European firms took advantage of the cheap replenishment of shortages. Xinfu purchased 10 bales of Jinshuangya brand at a price of 810 yuan, 20 bales of Wu Zijing brand at a price of 690 yuan, 10 bales of Jinbianbao brand at a price of 830 yuan, and 20 bales of MD brand at a price of 785 yuan. Jardine Matheson purchased 10 bales of Yuncheng brand at a price of 680 yuan (the above 13-15 pieces). It also purchased 10 bales of YZ brand 16-18 pieces at a price of 650 yuan. Benlai purchased 20 bales of Yue Rabbit brand 13-22 pieces at a price of 845 yuan (the above are all Shanghai white factory warp). Xinfu purchased 20 bales of Feishi brand at a price of 645 yuan, and 10 bales of Qinglian brand at a price of 600 yuan. Kechang purchased 7 bales of Wufu brand at a price of 490 yuan (the above are all Sichuan yellow factory warp 13-15 pieces).

<p>Since the departure of the British Company's ship the day before yesterday, the interest of</p>
<p>tea dealers in this port has been declining. Although Jardine Matheson and Jinlong and other firms are selectively purchasing top-quality Qimen black tea, their prices are extremely harsh. In view of the poor situation of Qimen tea, Chinese tea merchants convened an emergency meeting yesterday and decided to stop producing sub-tea. The green tea market is also sluggish. Although the China Tea Company has opened at 240 taels for Tunxi core-extracted Zhenmei, Pu Neng has stockpiled quite a bit of Zhenmei. Only Zhenmei needles are still well-received by French firms, and the rest are declining.</p>

<p>White Tung Oil Rises Repeatedly in Hankou</p>
<p>Zhejiang Tung Oil Follows Suit</p>
<p>Recently, foreign firms in Hankou have continued to make small transactions in white tung oil, with</p>
<p>prices selling for up to 22.4 yuan per 后 in foreign regulations. In addition, they have separately purchased more in Chongqing, Wanxian in Sichuan Province, and Changde in Hunan Province than in Hankou, so there is not much in Hankou. Most of the arrivals are Xiangtong from this province, and dealers have opened at 17 yuan plus some in customer regulations, and the situation is getting tighter. Wholesale prices also require 17.1-2 yuan, an increase of about 4-5 角 compared to last week. However, domestic sales are still not strong. Last week, Zhejiang tung oil in Hangzhou had already added up to 21.2 yuan per 砠 for Jiangjiao, but upon hearing the news that the Hankou market had improved, it naturally echoed and immediately added 22.8 yuan for sale. Dealers had to sell for 22.4 yuan or more, an increase of nearly 1 yuan compared to last week. The rising momentum seems to be sharper than in Hankou. This is also the habit of Zhejiang, so it is not surprising.</p>

<p>Shima dried longan meat has been scarce for a long time, but the company's inventory has not yet</p>

<h3 id="e260">Telegrams or Cannons? <a href="#e260" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c260" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">260</a></h3>
<p>— Tianfang</p>
<p>In this year of great turmoil, seeing the domestic situation and the regressive state of affairs, one cannot help but laugh and cry. No, only anger!</p>
<p>The four northeastern provinces have been lost and have not yet been recovered, and Peiping and Tianjin are also in danger. All those who have the blood of the Yellow Emperor flowing in their veins and who have the nationality of the "Republic of China" should unite and rise up to save themselves. However, the facts tell us the opposite.</p>
<p>The national crisis has been going on for two years. During these two years, the suffering of the 30 to 40 million people in the three northeastern provinces under the iron hooves of foreign races is unimaginable. Even the people of the whole country, due to the intensification of the imperialist policy of aggression, have led to the collapse of the countryside and the bankruptcy of the national economy. Among the 474 million people, except for a few high-ranking Chinese officials who can still leisurely enjoy themselves in dance halls and theaters, the rest have been plunged into an abyss.</p>
<p>However, the sound of the cannons of the imperialists cannot awaken the dreams of the intoxicated people, nor can it change the minds of the warlords. In these two years since the outbreak of the national crisis, we have seen a lot of news about the war. In addition to the loyal and courageous resistance of the Northeast Volunteer Army and the 19th Route Army, we have also heard of the infighting of the two Chens in Guangdong, the conflicts between Han and Liu in Shandong, the uncle and nephew fighting of Liu Xiang and Liu Wenhui in Sichuan, and the internal strife in Guizhou, Xinjiang, and Tibet. We really cannot use an abacus to calculate the lives and property sacrificed under these topics. All the compatriots who participated in these wars, after crying and fleeing, must say "serves them right" when they think of the people they usually raised who gave them pain!</p>
<p>We know that the invasion and massacre of foreign races is to destroy our country, but are the warlords'肆行 wars and署杀 going to destroy our nation? The warlords must be very clear about this, but we "A Dou" who are drunk and dreaming, are still ignorant, and exhaust our fat to raise executioners to massacre ourselves.</p>
<p>The civets raised in our homes are easily satisfied in their desires, and they can also catch rats and guard the house, doing their best for their masters. The warlords are not like this. The fatter you raise them, the more you want them to be safe, the more pain they will give you. In Sichuan, which is known as a rich area in the country, isn't the land tax already pre-collected until the 60th year of the Republic of China? The taxes of the era of our children and grandchildren have all been paid. These obedient people can be said to be "obedient" to the extreme. In theory, they should have peace and enjoy their remaining years. However, the equivalent price paid is the practice of 478 wars in 20 years, and they have suffered all the misery of exile.</p>
<p>Recently, the warlords Liu Wenhui and Deng Xihou of Sichuan Province have once again started a war because of "conflicts of interest," creating the record of the 479th civil war in Sichuan Province. According to reports, this war has extended to 800 Chinese miles and mobilized 400,000 people. Its scale is far greater than that of the isolated resistance of Su Ma, Li Du, and the 19th Route Army, which received no support. It is worth writing about in the future history of the Republic of China. When it comes to foreign affairs, they say "lack of military supplies" and "inconvenient transportation," but when it comes to internal affairs, new weapons are readily available. This kind of elusive military ingenuity, with various tricks, what else can we "A Dou" say besides admiration.</p>
<p>Whenever a civil war occurs, as usual, all parties will send out many telegrams, "imploring" and ordering. But as usual, it is not until one party is defeated that someone comes out to accept what is called "imploring" and "ordering." It is the cannons that win, but the general "A Dou" are sacrificed between this acceptance and non-acceptance. As for the result of the war, "the winner is king," and the name is naturally "punishing the rebels." What about the defeated side? Just like the lesson of the elder Mr. Yuan, he cupped his hands and said, "See you in five years." So five years, or not even five years later, justice turned again, and the second "punishment of the rebels" began, and so on to the third, fourth, four hundred and seventy-ninth, and so on. And the like of "A Dou" will always breathe between the cracks of people's interests.</p>
<p>Telegrams have become the only remedy for saving the country and dealing with all things. This time is no exception. There are telegram appeals from 70 million people in Sichuan and orders from the Executive Yuan to stop it, but the facts tell us that these appeal telegrams are like shouting "God save me." No matter how tearfully you speak, it will never move the heart of the murdering devil. Then, the only effective way to protect our lives and property, "a change of mind can achieve it" (original text of the Sichuan people's good telegram), is:</p>
<p>Rise up and no longer raise any domestic thieves!</p>

<h3 id="e261">Brief Thoughts After Reading the "Shen Bao Yearbook" <a href="#e261" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c261" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">261</a></h3>
<p>— Shibben</p>
<p>After the publication of the "Shen Bao Yearbook," because of its rich content</p>
<p>'All materials relating to party affairs, politics, military affairs, economy, education, transportation, society, academics, industry, etc. have been collected, and the compilation is novel', classified, precise and detailed, so within a few days of its release, it has become popular at home and abroad. The one I'm talking about', was just mailed to me by the post office yesterday', although I just flipped through it hastily', it has already sparked a lot of thoughts', I'll write a few of them below:</p>
<p>Among the resolutions of the Fourth National Congress',</p>
<p>there is a proposal by Liu Jiashu and 43 others: "Strictly order officials in all provinces to strictly guard the territory and not abandon their duties"-what effect does this kind of resolution have? Don't you see that General Tang of Rehe has already violated this resolution' and retreated without fighting, abandoning the defense', losing the entire province of Rehe, the shield of North China', causing the current crisis in Peiping and Tianjin? Tang Yulin's sins are profound, but it can be seen that the senior officials of the country's borders' cannot strictly abide by and implement the resolutions of the highest authority's congress', so everything else is needless to say.</p>
<p>Seeing He Ruqun and 28 others' proposal: "The case of earnestly protecting overseas Chinese"', I remembered that in recent days', the overseas Chinese in Mexico' have been expelled one after another', more than 4,000 people' according to the refugee representatives: there are still more than 10,000 large numbers of overseas Chinese' who will also be deported back home soon', alas! The treatment of overseas Chinese in a country', whether they can live and work in the country of residence', depends on the strength of their home country's international status', our noble country' is plagued by internal and external troubles', and the country is about to perish', of course it will be despised', abused', expelled', and arbitrarily treated'. The "case of earnestly protecting overseas Chinese" in a weak country's diplomacy' is naturally an unfulfilled check'! Reading "General Situation of the Army"', I know that our noble country is indeed the country with the most armies in the world'. Its number' is really alarming', with more than 2 million', alas! With so many troops', and the Japanese devils invaded', except for the 19th Route Army and Song Zheyuan and other minority troops, no one was willing to defend the country and resist the enemy', allowing the arrogant dogs to rush around', as if entering no man's land', killing people everywhere! Mountains and rivers change color'! Alas! Raising soldiers for a thousand days', using them for a day', with such an army' that I compare to "every bush and tree looks like an enemy soldier"', but in the end no one went to kill the enemy and resist', then all the soldiers are "all grass and trees"'.</p>
<p>China's air force' is also increasingly ashamed'. Even the airline's commercial planes' and the people's "Fords" and "Sykes" are all counted, and there are only 274 planes in the whole of China'. Compared with the thousands of planes in other countries', it is really a small sight to see a big one'. Therefore, patriots advocate that saving the country must first expand the air force'. As a result, various places have started raising money to purchase planes' to implement "aviation to save the country"'. But I think that with planes', but continuing the old habits of "non-resistance" and adhering to the "calm" effort', then even if there are as many as thousands or hundreds of planes', they will still be useless'. Don't you see that the "Shen Bao Yearbook" says' that Zhang Xueliang had 500 planes in the Northeast', but because of the three words "non-resistance"', all of them were looted as enemy spoils'. Therefore, "non-resistance" will not be defeated one day', it is better to buy one less plane', saving it for the enemy to create wealth'.</p>

<h3 id="e263">If I Had a Child <a href="#e263" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c263" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">263</a></h3>
<p>— Cun Xin</p>
<p>If I had a child, how would I teach and raise him? I often wonder.</p>
<p>Firstly, I know that an ideal child should have an ideal mother to nurture him. This ideal mother doesn't need to be worldly wise, but it doesn't hurt if she's a little naive. She should at least know a bit about art and be able to tell a few stories. Because children's hearts are light and beautiful, they need a beautiful environment to adapt to. When the child is sleeping in the cradle, the ideal mother should often play some organ music or similar things for him to listen to. Because there is no beauty more intangible than music, and it is also what children can best perceive. As for the placement of the child's bed, there should naturally be a beautiful and lively environment nearby. In the room, if there aren't any real flowers, some paper flowers should also be prepared. On the walls, instead of hanging some profound landscape paintings, it's better to hang some colorful watercolor paintings. But when the child grows up, among the watercolor paintings that he's tired of looking at, you must insert some photos of great people (including revolutionaries, scientists, thinkers, writers, artists, etc., but not important officials of the party and the country) so that they can gain inspiration in life from these fresh materials. If he cries, which is common for children, you must check the source of this reaction. Is it lack of milk? Or is it cold or hot? Let me tell you, never hold him out of indulgence, because all of a child's actions have no predetermined goal, and it's all trial and error. If the trial is wrong, he will correct it himself, and you must not give him bad suggestions. Furthermore, if he can walk and is tired of playing with clay dolls, you can teach him to get close to kittens, puppies, chicks, ducklings, and the like. This can allow him to come into contact with external things and cultivate his loving empathy, and it's definitely not just appreciating the small voices, the yellow feathers, and the exquisite postures. If he has a need for knowledge, then the ideal mother should often tell him some stories. The stories should be beautiful, but even absurd stories have a limit. The travels of chicks and ducklings and the fights of kittens and puppies are also fine, because he will eventually be able to verify that it's just a story. But if you tell him about gods, then this delusion will be difficult for him to eradicate forever. And don't tell ugly things, such as ghosts and monsters, which will hurt their beautiful hearts. In short, all these skills are things that every ideal mother should be familiar with and don't need to be explained in detail. Furthermore, if he gets carried away playing for a while and breaks your beloved clock or other objects, then you shouldn't be angry and punish him. You must know that this is the beginning of creation, and you should help him fix it. Things in the world cannot be accomplished at once. You must not use your adult-stage experience to reprimand inexperienced children. Negative reprimands are not as good as positive encouragement. Your responsibility is to increase children's interest in learning. What must also be remembered is that when children are playing their symbolic games, you must not destroy the houses they draw on the ground or trample on the imaginary characters. This is also a kind of cruelty that is enough to hurt their beautiful hearts. And when you are working, such as planting flowers and raising pigeons, you can ask your children to help. For them, this is sure to be readily obeyed, and they can also learn a little common sense, which they will definitely find more interesting than attending a nature class. The most important thing is to make children feel that doing things is a game, not dull drudgery.</p>
<p>Finally, we must know that the purpose of educating children is to make them have an independent personality and skills to deal with the world, and the parents' responsibilities are limited to the completion of the above two tasks. So I often think, if I had money and could afford a means of transportation, I would never want my son to go to school in a chartered car, but would buy him a bicycle and let him bump his nose and eyes together and break his hands and feet into eight pieces. I believe that one more failure will definitely lead to one more success. The responsibility of parents is to guide their children onto the road to independence, and definitely not to be 'oxen and horses' for life.</p>
<p>I would like to offer my opinions to men and women who are already or will become fathers and mothers.</p>

<p>— Zhi Kuan</p>
<p>The previous issue of this magazine had a six-character joke. Yesterday, while I was free at home, I casually read the newspapers and magazines and suddenly discovered a marriage proposal advertisement. The words were also in six-character phrases. It was truly a rare coincidence. After reading it, I specially extracted the original text and submitted it to this magazine. Readers, please do not ridicule it as a clumsy imitation.</p>
<p>This little one is twenty-eight, still waiting for a husband in her boudoir,</p>
<p>Though my figure isn't gorgeous, my attire is quite modern,</p>
<p>The purpose of life after marriage is to be with you day and night,</p>
<p>Travel with a car, live in a three-story Western-style house,</p>
<p>Eat at the same table, walk hand in hand when going out,</p>
<p>Dancing is being practiced, gambling skills are already all mastered,</p>
<p>If you enjoy this way, I guarantee you will be satisfied,</p>
<p>If you agree with the marriage proposal terms, you can first communicate secretly,</p>
<p>If both parties are satisfied, you can freely get engaged,</p>
<p>If the relationship is deep, you can open the shop later, transactions can also be carried out first,</p>
<p>If there are disagreements later, divorce is absolutely free,</p>

<p>— Yan Meng</p>
<p>Needing rest, thinking of stillness after extreme activity, this is originally human nature. If one believes in fate because of not having better opportunities, that is going backwards beyond reason. The economy is in recession, society is becoming increasingly fragmented, and the national crisis is even more severe. The giant wheels of the times are constantly turning, and everything is being swept into the wheels.</p>
<p>Rely on one's own strength to build one's own world,</p>
<p>Without relying on any external assistance, then what else do we displaced people have besides living in garret rooms? Complaining is useless and foolish. Friends, quickly seek our new world.</p>
<p>However, revolutionary theories, philosophies of love,</p>
<p>And great art are not nurtured in high-rise buildings but are budding in garret rooms. Poets, thinkers, literary giants... they all hide in garret rooms, pushing forward their own time, and each will is always throwing their youth in small sorrows, bitter faces, or cheerful conversations!</p>
<h2>Page 19</h2>
<p>Garret room, as the name suggests, should be a beautiful</p>
<p>"pavilion on the water"? But who knows that it is specifically carrying the disappointed, the unemployed, the exiles, burying the young people with great ambitions but no food? In such a country, in such a tragic and bleak phenomenon, if the Chinese youth are not so ignorant and numb, and good at comforting themselves, at least a large part of them would have committed suicide.</p>
<p>The weather is gradually getting hot, and I, who am used to living in garret</p>
<p>rooms, have lived in Chinese, semi-Chinese, semi-Western, and Western-style garret rooms. Now I have moved to a garret room in the French Concession. Every day, I go out early and return late to carry out our business. What do I care about the splendor or shabbiness of the room?</p>

<p>New Method to Eliminate the Odor of Rubber</p>
<p>The Mitham Rubber Company, affiliated with the Goodrich Rubber Company, after years of research and experimentation, has invented a method to make daily rubber appliances odorless. Most people consider the odor of natural rubber to be the most hateful. This latest chemical method of neutralizing odors is a great and remarkable success. The Mitham Company is now using the same method to improve the bath sponges used for bathing, so as to avoid using chemicals again. This is because chemical products have very little effect on clean skin, and sometimes even cause adverse effects.</p>

<p>"You blockhead, didn't I call him to come? Of course, you can lead him straight to my room."</p>
<p>Soon, she fell asleep again. This time, she slept for a long time, until a faint yellow dusk appeared at the windows. When she woke up for the second time, she saw that Zhang Wenbin was already sitting in front of her bed.</p>
<p>"Oh, when did you come? Why didn't you wake me up?" she said happily.</p>
<p>"Miss, I didn't dare to disturb you. You were too tired."</p>
<p>"But didn't you wait too long? Aren't you complaining at all?"</p>
<p>"Miss, you know I am very content. I watched you sleeping quietly, your gentle breathing, your beautiful languid state, to the point that even the sweet and soft air in this room can make me boast of my happiness. So what's there to be unsatisfied about? Would I want to be jealous of my own happiness?"</p>
<p>"Child!" She suddenly held his hand. "I didn't expect you to be so eloquent. You know that it's easy to win a woman's heart like this."</p>
<p>"Then how do you plan to love your lovely child?"</p>
<p>"What else do you want from me? Aren't you already sitting by my bed?"</p>
<p>At this time, Zhang Wenbin really became bold and kissed her hand tightly. It was a mysterious force that excited her to the point that she wanted to hold his head and kiss his lips passionately, but she still heavily stopped herself.</p>

<h3 id="e269">Movie Stars at Middle Age <a href="#e269" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c269" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">269</a></h3>
<p>— Zhong Qin</p>
<p>Those Who Aren't Blessed with Enduring Beauty Risk Being Abandoned, Leaving the Scene by Traveling</p>
<p>In Hollywood's movie scene, new stars spring up like mushrooms after rain, one after another, jumping onto the screen without any sign of stopping. At the same time, many stars who are past middle age gradually lose their luster in batches. Those older stars who are content retire and rest, or go traveling. Those who are not content gradually have no one to support them, their star power disappears, and they gradually fail and decline. This phenomenon is ceaseless in Hollywood. Metabolism is of course an unavoidable process for anything in the world, but this phenomenon of the old and the new replacing each other is even more pronounced in the movie city of Hollywood.</p>
<p>Some people say that Hollywood's movie scene is like a political stage, with changes that are impossible to predict. This is indeed a precise analogy. In Hollywood, actresses rely on their youth to gain a position in Hollywood. It's already very difficult to maintain that position for more than five years. As for a red-hot star, it's impossible to remain red for many years. How many stars in Hollywood stay in the movie industry for ten years? Once their youth passes, their opportunities in Hollywood also diminish. By middle age, it's impossible to stay in Hollywood any longer. Even if there are a few, like Mary Pickford, who recently still starred in a United Artists film called "Secrets" in Hollywood, half of it was relying on her past fame, and the other half was relying on good makeup techniques to make people in Hollywood unable to tell that she was already a middle-aged woman. Furthermore, this "Secrets" was actually filmed several years ago. As for whether she is willing to work in the future, it is still unknown. To give another example, when Pola Negri was first crowned as the queen of Hollywood movies, how glorious she was. Now, however, she is no longer able to obtain her former glory. The film "The Woman from Moscow", which was recently shown in Shanghai, is undoubtedly her last work.</p>
<p>As for saying that Marie Dressler was an old woman, how could she be the queen of Hollywood? Marie Dressler is indeed the only one in Hollywood history who can be considered an exception. Moreover, although she was also made a queen, she played old characters. The older and uglier she was, the better. She cannot be compared with many stars who rely solely on their youth to make money. Actresses in Hollywood are extremely terrified of the arrival of middle age. Their only way to avoid showing their middle age is makeup, but artificiality is ultimately false. Therefore, when they reach middle age, they are still eliminated one by one and cannot escape. Resting and long-distance travel are just a facade for their departure. The vicissitudes of life are also a natural trend.</p>
<p>Film Review</p>
<h3 id="e270">Re-review of "Career" <a href="#e270" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c270" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">270</a></h3>
<p>— Ming</p>
<p>Indeed, the first failure of this film lies in the weak consciousness of the script. We can see that the people in the first act have very contradictory actions and thoughts before and after (as told by the subtitles). The sudden changes make people feel that some of the people in the film are similar to fiction and have no unified personality. This is already enough to make the plot extremely scattered, let alone explain the central meaning clearly? The so-called "career path for women" is just a female performer returning to her old profession? It does not indicate a bright path. I am not saying that acting is not a profession, but most people must admit that being a performer is not a long-term profession. When youth fades and skills decline, one will be eliminated. So is a woman's career only temporary?</p>
<p>Moreover, the screenwriter seems to oppose love and marriage. Once there is a rift between husband and wife, they should separate and never allow reconciliation after repentance. This point may not be permitted by reason. It is true that a man can interact with many women at the same time, but a woman cannot talk with anyone other than her husband. Indeed, this is a distorted phenomenon in society, so the screenwriter also seems not to give the "official person" who does not allow his wife to have affairs and impose excessive punishment on her and does not allow him to repent, because he does not know that his wife sacrificed for him, so he turned his face completely. This is something understandable.</p>
<p>The director is also too negligent. For the scenery and so on, he only tries his best to seek their splendor and does not think about whether reality should be like this. The control of the actors is also very inappropriate. In small places, there are loopholes to be found. The photography is good, and the movement of the camera is also very lively, but the close-ups reflected by the mirror are used too much, which makes people tired. Star Film Company has the best light in domestic films, and this time it also maintains its past achievements. Although Xuan Jinglin is inevitably somewhat "past her prime", her performance is still good. There are some new dramatic elements in many places, and the director and actors should be responsible for this. Sun Min is too cautious, so she is too rigid. Wang Jiting can tell at a glance that he is playing a gangster, but he also has some merit in portraying a general playboy-style philistine. Zhu Qiuheng's performance is too over the top, completely losing the identity of a female secretary.</p>
<p>The subtitles are relatively good, concise and meaningful, and the scene division is not chaotic.</p>

<p>A part of the staff of Lianhua No. 2 Factory was filming the exterior scenes of "Little Toys" in Wuxi and lived in the Rong family villa. There were more mosquitoes and insects here than in Shanghai, so most people couldn't sleep well at night. One morning, Wan Lingyu got up early and took a walk in front of the flowers. She met Sun Yu. Sun asked, "Miss Ruan, did you sleep well last night?" Ruan frowned and said with a charming smile: "I didn't sleep well! The mosquitoes are too annoying.

<p>— Feng Ying</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, in the present era when women's rights have reached a surging period, various occupations in society are gradually having opportunities for women to get involved. The feudal phenomenon of "relying on men for a living" in the past has been eliminated by the times and will gradually diminish. However, in the transition between this old and new process, there are still many women who "rely on men for a living," and of course, men who play with women have not been completely eliminated.</p>
<p>This time, the star "Career" that is showing at the Central is very clearly intended to awaken women who "rely on men for a living" and are played with by men, and to indicate their way out: self-reliance is indeed a great inspiration for women of the times, and it is worth our attention.</p>
<p>In the plot, Junjie's unrestrained and dissolute behavior with his female secretary in the office after becoming an official, I think this kind of description of a licentious rogue is probably a strange phenomenon that truly high-ranking officials may not have. In the last scene when Lan Ying was about to leave, Junjie used the sentence "What will women do without men?" to attack the weakness of women who "rely on men for a living," but Lan Ying had a skill, gave up that life of being played with by men, and went to seek her own independent career path.</p>
<p>Zhang Shichuan's directing skills have indeed improved a lot compared to before. He is unwilling to relax at all in terms of the plot. This film is not his success.</p>
<p>In terms of actors, we have not seen Xuan Jinglin for a long time. This time on the screen, she tells us that her art is indeed good. Sun Min and Zhu Qiuheng's expressions are very realistic. What about the rest?</p>
<p>In short, the film tightly grasps the weakness of a part of women in society who "rely on men for a living" and issues a warning. At the same time, it gives a strong warning to men who use women as toys.</p>
<h3 id="e273">"Career" Is a Guide to Women's Way Out <a href="#e273" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c273" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">273</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Jiaqing</p>
<p>In every film, its title carries artistic meaning, such as the recent "New Year's Eve," "Awakening," "Women's Cry," and "Morning in the City," etc. "Career" is also one of them. Its advertisement has been promoted for a long time in the newspapers. Today is its first public screening at the Central Grand Theater. In order to try the film's art, I took a special trip to admire it.</p>
<p>The plot of this film tells us that relying on men is not beneficial. It also tells us that women must have a spirit of independence and the ability to save themselves, otherwise it will make you "self-harm." The plot is desirable, realistic, and novel. It guides the way out for modern women.</p>
<p>The director does not have any amazing good points in this film. It is somewhat more progressive than in "Broken Love" and more backward than in "Rouge Market." There are no skills, and there are many loopholes.</p>
<p>None of the actors have moving performances. Xuan Jinglin's performance is much worse than in "A Married Woman" at Dayi. Sun Min has made progress compared to "Rouge Market." The rest of the actors are just average.</p>
<h3 id="e274">After Watching "Career" <a href="#e274" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c274" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">274</a></h3>
<p>— Shi Zeyong</p>
<p>Since the release of "Women's Cry" by Star Film Company, the criticisms in the media have been consistently praised. And the recent films released are all very insightful and explanatory on women's issues. Of course, this obvious progress is indeed worthy of our admiration.</p>
<p>But today's release of "Career" at the Central has made people feel somewhat disappointed. Although this is another masterpiece by Mr. Ding Qianping after "Rouge Market," I dare not completely agree with and endorse it.</p>
<p>"Career," especially a woman's "career," is such a moving word and a matter that deserves attention! In this film, it inspires many women to recognize their own "career." It means that after a woman marries a husband, she should not be completely immersed in the river of love and rely on her husband. She must continue to work hard for her own "career." As in this film, the protagonist, Su Lan Ying, is a popular female performer. She abandons her stage life for marrying her husband, which is not her career at all. And her husband is an unfaithful overseas student. Once he is successful and becomes a director, he immediately changes his true colors, likes the new and tires of the old, and has another love. He even wants to insult and beat her. So Lan Ying suddenly realizes that she is unwilling to be insulted by a man. For the sake of her own personality and for the sake of her own "career," she still goes back to her original stage career. This is the destination of her career.</p>
<p>In summary, the consciousness of this "Career" makes me somewhat disappointed and not completely satisfied, because it does not provide a practical indication and explanation of what a career is. Compared with "Rouge Market," it is obviously a step backward.</p>
<p>Regarding the expressions of the actors, Xuan Jinglin, who plays Su Lan Ying, is the most suitable. Sun Min is obviously more advanced than in "Rouge Market"! Wang Jiheng is famous for his villain roles, and he is quite successful in this film. Gu Lanjun's performance is the most natural, but unfortunately, she appears too few times. In addition, the director's skills, the actors' expressions, and other photography scenery, etc., are worth watching.</p>
<h3 id="e275">The Eternal Regret of the Film Novel (THE WHITE SISTER) VIII <a href="#e275" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c275" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">275</a></h3>
<p>— Si Ping</p>
<p>He was gone. The beauty and joy of that sweet night were gone with him. But a kind of consciousness remained in her mind, comforting her. They are two lovers, that must be right. Trying to regain her composure, she followed her father back to the dance hall. Ernesto was annoyed because she had left, and Angela danced a waltz with him in his stubborn arms.</p>
<p>After the grand meeting, when the night was quiet, her father summoned her to his room. She went to him still wearing her evening dress. As soon as she met her father, she expressed her apologies. Prince Sheremetev realized that this matter could not be settled with an apology, and even heard Angela's tone implying that she regretted the marriage with Ernesto, which greatly alarmed him. She shouldn't break the engagement!</p>
<p>The conversation became more and more unpleasant. She openly said that she had fallen in love with that young soldier and that the soldier also loved her. Prince Sheremetev took out a rolled-up piece of paper from the drawer of his desk and said coldly that that was her marriage contract.</p>
<p>"Father!" Angela pleaded earnestly, "I originally wanted to do what you wanted me to do. I secretly prayed that I would love Ernesto, but I fell in love with Giovanni!"</p>
<p>"Love!" Her father's face became very ugly. "I'll tell you what love is! Do you know your mother? Do you recognize her?" He continued like a wild beast. "She ran away! With another man! Abandoned me! Do you understand!? Also because of love! She also thought she could find happiness! Oh, Angela, my child, believe me, I know which way is best for you: I want you to be happy, safe, and comfortable!"</p>
<p>"Where is mother now?" Angela asked, ignoring his pleas.</p>
<p>"She's dead." Prince Sheremetev, seeing that his heartfelt pleas could not make her change her mind, said angrily, "That man also abandoned her, so she committed suicide. That's your example! A soldier! Without a penny! You picked him up on the street!"</p>
<p>Angela defended Giovanni for a while and then sobbed and cried. She must go to see Giovanni, she can't not see him, she would rather die. She wailed and ran out of the room. (To be continued)</p>
