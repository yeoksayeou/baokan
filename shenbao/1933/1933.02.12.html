<p>邀請美俄參加亦在討論之列</p>

<p>（日内瓦）今夜起草委員會散會時所擬十九國委員會之建議、已草成六頁、聞尙擬再草三頁、其中一頁料將包含邀請美俄擁護報告書與建議一層、此間觀察時事者聞所草建議内、將包含邀請美俄建議消息、多信委員會之意、現欲繼續工作、不顧日本最近提議蓋照目前情勢祇有日本承認滿洲之中國主權後、始能變更起草委員會原定計劃、此時各方雖皆鵠候日人答復、但罕有料東京政府將對此讓步者、（十日國民電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）國聯秘書處今晨頗忙、將修正草建議案、印送各委員、九人小組會定今日午後三時半再行集議、會議時間、似將延長、因目前尙未有覓得新方法、以處理組織談判委員會一問題之氣象也、小組會各委員深知彼等不特造史、且亦造有潛能性的國際公法、是以彼等欲其所議定之解决方法、亦可適用於任何事件、庶將來世界各處可用以溝通國聯　約第十五與第十六兩條、昨日小組會散會時、各委員暫時無結果而散之事態、當可因各委員在餐案上與他處非正式交換意見而得進步、在國聯法律家亦復潛心研究繕具草案之工作、故昨日之事態、可望轉佳、是以今日小組會會議或可發現一種穩健的共同的基礎、而使進步愈見迅速、目前且有在今日長時間集會中工作或可完成之氣象、（十一日路透電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）今日美聯社從某方面探悉、起草委員會業已同意之建議綱要、㈠引盟約第十欵·非戰公約第一欵·及九國公約關於領土完整部份條文之原文、宣稱、所　此等原則必須遵守之、㈡引國聯大會三月十一日决議案原文、删除其中現已不適用之數點、重行申明此項决議案必須遵守、㈢引李頓報告第九章十項原則本文、其第十原則末尾有引語符號内爲　如故孫中山博士所建議者一一語、並宣稱、國聯大會採用此項原則、作爲所定之圓滿解决條件、㈣建議内規定設一談判委員會、但其組織性質人選及權力、仍未决定、並稱、談判委員會最要職責、在談判設立一滿洲統治機關、旣能不抵觸中國主權、又可保證維持秩序、保護日本權利及　　利益、再談判委員會又一任務、將在按照李頓報告十原則内第八原則、　節監督滿洲之撤兵、其末節則勸國聯會員國拒絕承認「滿洲國、」不與其合作、並謂國聯决議將通知非會員國、請其採取同樣態度、</p>
<p>又聞起草委員會在星期五已實際决定談判委員會應由國聯行政院委派、並應授權委派非會員國之代表、其意蓋指美國與蘇俄也、又談判委員會主要工作、將在遠東、其任務將須二三年、故頗趨向於主張由列强在遠東外交與領事代表組織、俾限制在遠東無利益之國家不能參加、倘中日雙方有一方不欲派代表加入談判委員會、則聞起草委員已决定可以自動宣告該國不遵從建議、如雙方俱願加入、則起草委員對於將來萬一談判决裂後、决定應負責任國家之方法有兩種主張、一派以爲應授權談判委員會自爲决議、補充國聯大會之建議、假定關於撤兵日期陷入僵局、則該委員會可爲最後决定、如有一造不從此决定、應自動認爲不遵從國聯大會建議、</p>
<p>另一派以爲倘授予該委員會如此廣大權力、不啻授以作補充建議之權、日本將可合法反對、要求僅國聯大會有權提出建議、且遇有非會員國加入該委員會時、自法律點觀察、日本之反對更有正確理由、因日本可訴告以非會員國草擬規章　背國聯盟約之故、</p>
<p>更有若干委員提議、倘遇談判委員會陷入僵局時、則所爭問題應請國聯大會决定、但亦有認此種手續、定致時常請求國聯解决、使國聯成爲世界笑柄、今日起草委員會於下午三時三十八分在秘書長室會議、繼續起草、（十一日國民電）</p>

<h3 id="c11">「是」與「否」之爭執 <a href="#c11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>晦</p>
<p>國際聯盟對中日糾紛。丨丨東北被强佔問題之解决。自九一八事變發生迄今未嘗考慮有效之裁制方法吾人固承認國聯僅一道德的制裁機關决無實力足以抑制日本帝國主義之武力侵略矧一二大國又皆有左袒日本之意默認日軍在東北之一切暴行。具有特殊背景。同時我國直接被害。除訴請國聯主持「公理」爲道德上裁制外。亦殊無更有力之表示。因是國際聯盟荏苒遷延。并道德的裁制。亦吝而不與焉。其所以反覆爭持是非莫决者。徒以「遠東均勢」旣破。强國間之利益分配未均耳。彼日本者固已爲所欲爲。發揮其「大陸政策」至於頂點。我國縱令高唱如何抵抗。於日本軍國主義的侵略。無損毫末。長此以往。國際在遠東均衡。將愈殘破。中國市塲。益加敗壞。此豈英法所甘。恐美國尤難坐視。</p>
<p>國聯爲保持其顏面計。爲維持列國在「遠東勢力均衡」計。皆不能不有所表示。是以國聯十九國委員會往復商量。乃發出對日本質問之函。其主要意見爲詢問。</p>
<p>『日本對其所承認爲獨立國之『滿洲。』「是」「否」不認其爲一種解决（滿洲問題）之方法。』</p>
<p>并請日本給與「是」或「否」之明白答復。如認爲是也。則十九國委員會將準備接受日本之保留案。而進行盟約第十五條第三項之調解。如其「否」也。則將按照第十五條第四項製作報告爲適當之建議。此舉在國聯洵已盡其温厚和平之能事矣。而日本則以爲如答覆爲「是。」不啻自批其頬。自認取消其一手製造之傀儡「滿洲國。」而屈服於列强共管之下。將旣得之「滿洲」利益。强分若干以與英法。甚至美國機會均等。亦必分嘗盃羹。如應爲「否。」則十五條第四項之進行。在所難免。日本仍將屈服於「建議」（共管）之下。而犠牲其對東北之獨占。故無論爲「是」爲「否。」日本皆處於不利地位。於是軍部憤然。政府嚣然。羣相集議。會商對策。乃固執其傳統的侵略主張。硬認傀儡之「滿洲國」爲旣成事實。列國須加承認。非然者。即「退出國聯亦所不惜」云。</p>
<p>日本軍國主義者以及軍部代言人如「外交時報」之流。對國聯早已發揮輕蔑論調。大倡其亞細亞門羅主義。其獨霸遠東。强佔滿洲。確爲不可掩蔽之事實。是以我國之於旣失領土主權。不用「鐵血。」空談是非。萬難收回。外交上之樽爼折衝。不過爲一種儀式。應酬國際間之表面活動已耳。日本之侵略華北。窺取熱河。擾亂平津。無論其是否退出國聯。皆將採取同一手法。吾人試舉其陸軍當局二月九日之聲明。公然主張侵犯熱河「滿洲（傀儡）國」内之事。引學良不應出兵。出兵即屬挑衅。而日軍向熱河出動。則屬於「維持治安之必要手段。更有甚者。竟謂其侵略爲「滿洲（傀儡）國之主權發動。」結語又復文過飾非。謂此種侵略『非對中國挑動戰爭。」即將來亦無挑起戰爭之意。』此種論調。旣一力蔑視我國之領土主權。更何有於國際聯盟之空言公道耶。</p>
<p>然則日本之退出國聯與否。在國聯之關係。僅少得日本所繳付之會費。其他則並無任何損失。或者能因此刺激而覓得若干國際間之「正義。」亦未可知也。在筆者之愚。以爲日本果退出國聯者。吾人縱今後將難得與日本外交代表口舌爭辯之機會。然而在外交上。第一·此後日本將陷於國際的孤立。第二·國聯旣不能抑制日本之暴行。反加强其暴力的獨占。或將促起英國之反省。不再偏聽日本。第三·打破共管局面。第四·形成新的國際均勢。第五·加强日本自身之困難。其對外貿易。縱未必即受影響。而一般人民生活。勢不易維持。第六·日本旣退出國聯。則國聯任何批判。日本皆可置之不顧。我國雖少一種外交上之運用。今後且與日本短兵相接。以實力作最後之實際爭鬭。不再依賴他人。而努力自救。</p>
<p>總之。日本對華侵略。無論其退出國聯與否。抑或國聯存在與否。其不能於樽爼折衝。尋求解决。皆爲顯著之事實。一年又五個月之敎訓。尤當充分警惕。此後或將索性擱起「公理」以看「角力」之如何結果。</p>

<p>對遠東决維持史汀生主義對歐洲清理大戰所遺時局</p>
<p>（哈瓦斯社十二月華盛頓通信）美國「外交評論」、與民主黨之關係及其在美國外交上之　　、均爲吾人所深知、明年一月、該雜誌當發表郝斯上校一文、論美國今後之外交、郝氏係前總統威爾遜之至友、深受信任、其所言自饒有與趣也、</p>
<p>郝氏論文闡述「美國在羅斯福新總統治下之精神」、據築所見、民主黨新政府本年三月接受政權之後、其目的將在結算歐洲大戰所遺留之時局、以恢復全世界之信任、解除國際商業之障碍、而使各國執政者、注其精力、以求新的與建設計畫之實現、</p>
<h3 id="c75">共和黨政失敗原因 <a href="#c75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>以前三屆共和黨政府、亦欲達到同樣目的、但未能以切於實用之形式、考慮經濟問題、卒乃一無所成、又因囿於州界、眼光狹小、以致此種問題、遷延至今、使當局倍感困難、說者謂哈定·顧理法·與胡佛三總統所行政策、皆受共和黨自私自利之影響、該黨對威爾遜前總統懷恨不解、以致歐戰雖終、而戰時思想依然存在、經濟恢復歸於失敗、時局杌揑不安、世界各種無地不然、凡此種種、謂當由共和黨三總統屍其咎、實非過甚之詞、</p>
<h3 id="c76">羅斯福將改弦更張 <a href="#c76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>共和黨旣以此而失敗矣、則新總統羅斯福、當另以一副精神、以應付目下種種問題、郝斯根據羅斯福歷次宣言、加以研究、謂深信羅斯福一旦主政、無論對於本國人民或外國政府、皆將以同一公允同一堅决之態度出之、郝斯又謂、新總統曾爲威爾遜總統之閣員、感受威氏之影響甚深、</p>
<p>郝氏將羅斯福登台後所應解决之問題、如關稅·戰債·安全·軍縮·及遠東問題等、逐一審查、</p>
<h3 id="c77">第一　關稅問題 <a href="#c77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>據渠所見、稅則問題、自歐戰以來、已完全改變、美國原爲債務國、現已一變而爲債權國、從前美國商務結算、常爲有利、然至今日則因美國轉爲富有之國、歐洲各國、爲美國之債權人者、現則轉貧、由邏輯上自然之推演、美國商務之結算、自亦不能不爲之轉換、爲今之計、最妙之法、莫如使進口货儘　增加、但若减少出口貿易、則爲策之最下者、凡此皆以關稅政策爲轉移、胡佛總統之政策、在提高關稅、但一九二二年至一九二九年間、美國製造品輸出之數、大增、郝氏謂美國之主顧、在美國借得金元、就地購買美國產品、然此等主顧、不能以同等數量、向美國推鎖貨物、其原因係受財政不健全發展之害、此種發展、卽以低利政策、增加銀行放欵額數、而使美國吸收外國鉅量證券、吾人不使外國賺取美國金元、以償還對美債務、而以美金貨與外國、使之償還利息、</p>
<p>郝氏認此爲美國政策之錯誤、乃主張如下之理論、眞正關稅問題、在使外國賺取相當額數之美金、以償還債務、並使外國消納美國貨物、而不必舉債、按各國向美國人民所借之欵、每年應償還者、約一、二○○、○○○、○○○美金之譜、吾人應使各國、不再借新債、而能以貨物與現金、分别償還一部份、吾美放出之欵、固當顧及、而美國對外商務、亦當加以保護、使不致受不公平之排擠、此制定關稅政策時、所當兼顧者也、現行關稅率、有當酌予减輕者、亦有應大加削减者、予爲此言、並非主張自由貿易制、亦非主張以關稅收入、供給預算上之需要、所望關稅旣不妨害商務之競爭、又能收回放出之欵項耳、戰後美國所行之關稅制、尙有一種流弊、卽惹起各國報復手段是也、各債權國、四顧茫然、計無、出所美國於此、當示以南針、俾有出路可尋、新總統羅斯福、有意召集國際會議、以討論關稅减輕問題、此歷史上可成爲重要事跡、關稅制度之改良、或由此種會議討論之、或由世界經濟會議討論之、要之、世界各國、對於減輕關稅、與對於經濟上之妥定、固有同等之需要也、</p>
<h3 id="c78">第二　債戰問題 <a href="#c78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>郝氏論戰債問題云、予以爲新政府主政之後、當努力使戰債、不復爲國際上之問題、此事當由美國與各債務國進行談判以解决之、予意來年春季、各債務國、當分别邀請　國、舉行會議、以有組織之方法、解决戰債問題、而無須採用拒付、或將到期之欵、暫行停付各種手段、羅斯福曾宣言、贊助此種會議、並謂必須低减關稅、故外貨易於進口、而後外國始能還債云、郝氏反覆說明、遷移不定、實爲世界經濟狀况遲遲不能恢復常態之一原因、又謂羅斯福於一九二二年二月二日演說時、希望戰債問題、能於迅速妥協、羅氏對此問題、澈底了解、故作此言、並非一種空泛議論云、</p>
<p>郝氏繼謂歐戰同盟各國、在洛桑會議時、具有眞誠志願、暫將戰債問題忘却、並在德國補償問題、得到顯著之進步、以謀最後之解决、其所以　此者、實因各國人民、了然於補償問題、籍罩歐陸、終將釀成大禍、不如忍痛解决之爲愈也、吾美人民、亦應以同一理由、同等辦法、努力於戰債問題之解决、使不再爲國際上之爭點、</p>
<h3 id="c79">第三　軍縮問題 <a href="#c79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>對此問題、郝氏云、吾人如誠意主張裁軍、卽宜有所作爲、俾各國感覺其土地及財產、均有安全保障、然後裁軍之事、繼之而起、舍此以外、别無他法、</p>
<p>郝氏旋聲明民主黨全國大會之計劃、主張遇有條約受威脅時、須互相　詢、以期用有效方法、維持巴黎非戰公約、郝氏嗣稱、關於軍縮問題、應以政治問題、　諸技術問題之前、使各國在相當安全之程度以内、從事裁軍、各國能感受幾分安全、則幾分之軍力、卽可歸於無用、未有不樂於裁减者、</p>
<p>例如各國共同立定計劃、以預防侵略、並互相保證、任何國家、不先行警告、或經過談判、不能破壞此種計劃、必如此保證、而後陸地軍縮、乃可實現、惟某一國家、遇國際團體、坦白討論某種國際行動、是否與其利益相符合、是否有益於和平之維持時、該國若欲保留其自由判斷、自由行動之權、或不願以自主並負責任份子之態度、而出以何項行動、又未可同日語矣、</p>
<h3 id="c80">第四　遠東問題 <a href="#c80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>郝氏謂遠東及滿洲問題中、美國有兩種利益、一即維持條約之尊嚴、一即維持門户開放之傳統主義、上年夏間、國務卿史汀生所宣佈之原則、乃欲雙方當事國、以一種自動之行爲、恢復原來狀况、或由雙方當事國、在國聯會指導之下、直接交涉、以解决爭端、如能實行第二方法、則美國之眞正目的、可以達到、即維持凱洛克非戰公約是也、</p>
<p>最後郝氏謂、予敢謂在羅斯福政府之下、美國外交政策、必能趨於寛大、而合於人道、吾人當負之責任、必不拒絕、惟美國若以公平態度、對待他國、則希望他國亦能以公平相待耳、吾人試以公平爲行動之標準、惟切盼其他各國、對於一切與美國人民幸福及安全有關之事項、亦以同一原則出之、云云、</p>

<p>賠欵之收入，信用藉以維持，營業益可發達。人壽保險亦可用於合股事業，以作股東不測收回股本時準備。且人壽保險公司鉅額之投資，　益於實業界之發展，洵非淺鮮，蓋人壽保險公司實爲金融集中機關，各種實業多賴以發展，今就美國而論，人壽保險公司購買各種有價證券，爲數約有二十萬萬元之鉅，佔全國企業資本之大半。其對於實業界供獻之偉大，亦爲彰彰可考之一端耳。</p>

<p>人壽保險對於個人，家庭，敎育，實業，有相互之利益，則其構成社會之安寗，自不殆言，蓋人爲家庭之原素，社會復由家庭而組織，投保壽險者旣衆，安居樂業者自多，民衆之生活旣安定，社會之治安自可因此而穩固。且其滋榮實業，容納人材，減少失業。以及僱主爲僱員投保壽險，是以消弭勞資糾紛，均爲增進治安之上策也。</p>

<h3 id="c101">日本人壽保險事業發展迅速 <a href="#c101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>紐約人壽保險公司副會長瓊斯君，最近在紐約舉行的人壽保險聯合會會議中，作過一次演講，對於日本人壽保險事業的發展，非常推崇讚頌。</p>
<p>他說：『五十年前，日本并沒有人壽保險，也不知道什麽呌做人壽保險，但是目前牠丨日本在人壽保險的權威中，已佔了世界第四的地位，美國聯邦爲世界人壽保險業巨擘，佔世界營業總數百分之七十，美國次之，加拿大又次之。</p>
<p>『日本對於保險事業的發展，是異常努力。牠的發展時期可以分做三個階段：一八八零年是日本人壽保險事業創始時期，一九○○年後爲發展時，一九一六年後爲最興盛時期。</p>
<p>『許多奮發有爲的異國青年學生，來美國學習人壽保險學的，差不多都是日本遣送而來的，他們常常的參觀考察各公司的内部組織營業方針以便返國時的應用。</p>
<p>『保險學丨包括人壽及財產丨在日本國内每個富有的人爲什麽應當購買人壽保險？</p>
<p>一個富有資財的人，應當購買人壽保險的理由，有下列數點：</p>
<p>㈠花費最低的代價獲得隨時可以應用的資金，不致使他的財產事業受到損失。</p>
<p>㈡保障他死後，子嗣能夠得到固定的遺產。</p>
<p>㈢保持他因投資失敗後的原有社會地位。</p>
<p>㈣保障他死後的財產的安全。</p>
<p>㈤作其他的投資失利時的保障以免財產有所耗失。</p>
<p>㈥作其他事業失敗時財產損失的保障。</p>
<p>㈦保障日後事業失敗能有固定的收入。</p>
<p>㈧可以免除財產的耗失。</p>
<p>㈨能作遺產稅的保障。</p>
<p>㈩保險的資財，在投保後即可享受使用，并不是要廿年後方可享受使用。</p>
<p>㈩㈠獲得良好穩固的投資。</p>
<p>㈩㈡消除投機的觀念。</p>
<p>㈩㈢年老不能經營工作時可以得到固定的收入。</p>
<p>㈩㈣爲家屬的經濟謀保障。大學的商科都規定爲必修科，在高級商業中學内也差不多都有保險原理這門科目。</p>
<p>『日本各保險公司的辦事人員都曾受過美國的訓練一切營業進行的方法均以本會的標準爲依歸。所以他們的學識經騐，得以提高，營業亦能發展。</p>
<p>『目前世界對於人壽保險的目光，都集中在美國，但是本會最近的觀察這種情勢已有轉移到别的國家的可能。美國已經自覺了，願意將他在保險業上所得的成功的經騐，有機會的來帮助其他各國的人壽保險事業的發展。同時也讓我們把美國所保持的世界保險額的記錄漸漸減低，使各國在人壽保險上得到平均的發展。</p>
<p>『發展世界各國保險事的必要條件，爲促進社會進化，提高生活標準，維持世界和平，然後才能得到順利的發展。』</p>
<h3 id="c102">美國總統發現雙包案 <a href="#c102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>主角原來是一個保險業經理總統一句戲言因之生意興隆</p>
<p>美國最近發生一有趣之雙包案不但社會哄動一時即在人壽保險業中至今尤成爲美談。去歲大選羅斯福當選時，各地報紙紛紛競載羅肖像，以便崇拜羅氏者一親風采，不料紐約城羅卡司德城有一業保險經理名肯納爾者，其像貌與羅氏一式一樣維妙維肖，經地人民發覺後，於是一班崇拜羅氏者莫不以一覘此假總統爲榮幸，甚至有不知底細之人，往往誤認爲羅氏本人。因之肯氏出外時常被多數人包圍，以便一親風采，每日親至肯氏寓所求晤，尤不可勝數。後羅氏得知是項消息，乃親往羅卡司德城與肯氏會晤，相見之下，亦爲諤然，不禁脫口而出曰：「此乃余之兄弟也」。肯氏自經此次品題後，身價更高百倍，當地投保人壽保險之人士，從此均以經手於此「總統兄弟」爲榮，不但肯氏生意興隆，即公司方面亦因此而增加不少保户，由此足見美國人士崇拜羅氏之心理云。</p>
<h3 id="c103">銳聲失去因禍得福 <a href="#c103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>馬拿馬司卡倫敦地方，有一個專門以長嘯爲職業者，他爲保護他的尖銳的發音起見，向一家保險公司保了聲音險，當時訂明如果他的聲音發生意外時，由公司每星期給予美金五十元的賠欵，有一次他的尖銳的喉音，發生了意外的損傷，不能發長嘯聲，公司方面不但按照合同履行，并將這種賠欵增加至每星期美金一百五十元，而且付到他的喉音復原爲止，當時他聽到這個消息非常高興，因爲他的喉音，雖然暫時失去，不能從事他的職業，但是每星期可得的保險賠欵反而較他以前的薪金意外的增加了五元美金。這眞是因禍得福云。</p>

<p>保鑣俄人衛士沙狄夫衛主殞命兩警士奮勇追捕綁匪各受重創鄭錫棠傷勢甚重但醫治經過尙佳</p>
<p>昨日下午二時許、南市外灘　太碼頭（即公用局所標定之六號碼頭）附近、發生一駭人聽聞之綁票案、而被綁者、即係兩次　綁未遂之著名航業鉅商甬人鄭錫棠、此番蓋　第三次，雖亦未落匪手、然鄭之頭部、被匪擊中一槍、勢甚危殆、隨鄭保鑣之俄人一名、則當塲被匪擊中太陽穴要害、竟以身殉、一區總署警士兩名、因奮勇追捕、亦各受重傷、流彈傷小工一人、綁匪共來三人、均被兎脫、查肇事地點、爲人烟最稠密之區、而匪徒竟敢於堂堂白晝糾衆綁架、開槍死傷多人、實屬南市地方破題兒第一次、茲將詳情分述於后、</p>
<h3 id="c141">鄭錫棠之事業 <a href="#c141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>本埠著名航業鉅商鄭錫棠、年四十一歲、浙江鎭海人、手足凡三君適居長、妻厲氏於去歲逝世、共育四子二女、除長子長女兩人、均已成年、業經嫁娶外、餘均幼稚、鄭在滬經營航業、堪稱　擘、其最著者、即董家渡老公茂輪船公司、南市外灘二一四號之平安公司、公共租界北京路一七零至一七八號之通裕航業公司及浦東白蓮涇之大規模修船廠、均爲鄭氏所手創、此外其他各種副業、更不一而足、</p>
<h3 id="c142">避囂卜居浦東 <a href="#c142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>鄭天性儉樸、勤愼自勵、而尤富責任心、舉凡君所創各業、均不憚劬勞、而自兼總理、君鑒於滬西繁華太甚、爲避免　囂計、遂卜居浦東白蓮涇地方、但滬醒輪船公司、君每日按時必親往辦公、雖大風雨、未嘗稍間、君每日黎明即起、稍事進食、即來浦西、先至北京路寫字間、午餐後、即至南市平安公司、迨事畢後、尙須往各處接洽瑣事、每至深夜、方買槕而歸、其勤勞有如此者、君因公務過繁、僅置備一小奥司汀轎車以代步、租界號碼第七零二一號（市五三七零號、）</p>
<h3 id="c143">一度被綁未遂 <a href="#c143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>君因聲譽日降、詎竟遭匪徒所埀涎、　憶民國十九年十月間、鄭一度在南市大達碼　途遇綁匪、當時匪等正擬將鄭挾登預停路旁之汽車中、而鄭竟竭力　扎、一匪即向鄭開放一槍、彈珠擊穿鄭之皮袍、適命　於衣袋内之日記簿上、致未受傷、而當時鄭竟突用嘴咬該匪執槍之手腕、匪顧痛而槍落地、鄭更拾起抛入浦中、同時探警聞訊趕至、當場截獲一匪、未幾匪　伏法、</p>
<h3 id="c144">二次綁去其女 <a href="#c144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>嗣後鄭即迭接匪方來函、百般恫嚇、君卒置不理、旋又在租界遇險一次、卒無恙、未幾、君之一子一女、在學校門口、綁匪又臨、當時子倖免、而將女架去、伹不逾旬即出險、自此以後、鄭乃雇定一俄人衛士沙狄夫VVSaraeff爲保鑣＼並領得自衛手槍一支＼（槍身號碼第四四三八○三號）終日隨護、故嗣後匪等雖屢經設計、終未得手、</p>
<p>忠勇俄人衛士沙狄夫</p>
<h3 id="c145">昨日三次來綁 <a href="#c145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>昨日下午一時許、鄭循例至南市平安公司辦公、事畢已二時五十分、鄭乃約同副經理陳已生相偕至他處有事、詎鄭陳甫入車坐定、保鑣沙狄夫正在關閉車門之際、突由路旁　上一身體魁梧身着灰色布袍、一穿藏青　嘰棉袍、一御布袍元色馬甲頭戴绒帽之綁匪三人、一匪即奔至沙狄夫之前、出槍恫嚇、另一匪即將副經理陳已生逐下、并命火速上樓、</p>
<h3 id="c146">保鏢俄人殞命 <a href="#c146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>陳一見情知遇匪、祇得被迫下車、快步登樓、一面拔出警笛狂吹、詎笛聲方起、同時樓下槍聲大作、祇聞砰砰砰三　、而鄭與沙狄夫已倒臥血泊中矣、蓋當陳上樓時俄人沙狄夫即欲拔槍抵抗、而一匪先下手爲强、即向沙之頭部轟擊一槍、彈中右太陽穴、立時倒地、腦漿迸裂、後送同仁醫院不及醫治殞命、所有沙之自衛手槍、遂入匪手、同時第三匪即將鄭從車内向外拽、</p>
<h3 id="c147">肉票中槍劇傷 <a href="#c147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>鄭因前次數度遇匪、</p>
<p>皆因抵抗而得脫、此</p>
<p>次又擬援引前例、以冀萬一之倖、不料竟觸該匪之怒、向鄭之頭部轟擊一槍、子彈自頭頂射入、並未洞穿、遂亦同臥于血污中、匪等見目的已達、即由南首楊家渡街向西一直而逃、當時一區總署巡邏警張殿勇·楊占標·兩人、均聞槍聲趕到、匪等經外　瓜街向北折入施相公弄、又北達老太平弄、而至大東門、當時該衆適有人鬥毆觀者擁塞、匪等遂乘機混入人叢中、逃逸無踪、</p>
<h3 id="c148">兩警均中槍傷 <a href="#c148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>當張楊二警追捕時三匪沿途開槍、楊警追抵楊家渡時、左肩已命中一彈、張警右膊、亦受重創、但二警終不稍怯、直追抵大東門、匪等失踪後、方始歸署報告、兩人均送上海醫院、張警肘骨已斷、楊警較輕、至於鄭錫棠已於受傷後、爲汽車夫張阿榮載送上海醫院、經醫生視察後認腦部已受重創、勢甚危殆、</p>

<p>江　江新扣留二百餘桶小東門各魚行已提交涉招商局長江輪船、往來漢滬、裝運鮮魚辦法、每桶收費　元、餘爲船員水手等所得、今因局方整理　業、剔除稍包、昨日起、開始派員、將江輪所運魚桶、一律扣留、已引起極大糾紛、詳情如下、</p>
<p>運魚收費　長江鮮魚運滬、由各魚行委托長江船、裝桶　來、招商局各江輪、亦載運此貨、但因不能入艙、多數堆在艙面、及台甲上、各魚行每桶納費二元及二元五角、惟不入局中水脚、由船上水手等分得、上年李偉侯任總理時、與各江輪船主及水手頭目、訂定運費辦法、每魚一桶、繳運費洋半元、由頭目送交船主、轉解局中、用作製備水手號衣之資、歷來均照此例實行、</p>
<p>變更辦法　自劉鴻生接任總理以來、對於長江各輪之營業上、已在積極進行、不准船員水手夾　稍包、而於長江鮮魚運滬、因局中無有水脚　入、更認爲絕大損失、遂决議將該項魚桶裝運、統歸局内正式收取水脚、特通告各江輪、一律照辦、惟各船頭目、以魚桶裝船、每件已納五角、由船主收繳、何謂局中未曾收得、且爲前任總理議定之運率、實非稍包私運、故照常裝載、</p>
<p>扣留魚貨　自昨日起、局方爲實行魚桶收費起見、特命南樓棧長李榮生、於長江輪船進口時、派員到輪、實行檢查、並命扣留各魚桶、李棧長乃率帶司員工人、至金利源碼頭守候、及江靖輪抵埠時、被李查獲鮮魚六十桶、即行扣留、提卸上陸、存入八號貨棧、至下午四時許、江新輪又到滬、又被李棧長查獲大批鮮魚、共計一百數十桶、一併扣存金利源碼頭、</p>
<p>貨商交涉　兩船到滬、小東門各鮮貨行、循例派工人到碼頭提貨、以便運到行内、應市發售、且以鮮貨、須隨到隨提、不得延誤片刻、昨日各行商以來貨突被局方扣留存棧、鮮魚滯阻、即遭腐爛、損失巨大、當派代表至南棧、向李交涉、索取魚桶、豪無結果、各魚商乃到局中交涉、僉以運費早納、如果認手續不符、則責在船主、不應將商人魚桶扣留云云、至記者草此報告時、此事尙未解决、</p>

<p>石於心不甘控妾等串放白鴿</p>
<p>妾以發育未全難受痛苦爲言</p>
<p>寗波人石彙信、現年四十一歲、家住法租界𥝻牛公司　　里卅號門牌、向業銅鐵生意、略有積蓄、家有一妻一子、石因兼　父輩子嗣關係、　思納一小星、乃向人露意代爲物色、去年九月間、石友袁錦春及華菊泉介紹無　女子姚才雲（卽瑞雲）願作爲妾、姚女年方十七、姿容娟秀、經石一度審視後、認爲滿意、當付茶禮洋一千元、迨過門後、同居祇三十九天、卽因</p>
<p>同房關係　發生惡感、而姚女亦卽歸寗、石遂延陳文祥律師具狀、向第一特區法院自訴姚瑞雲、及姚之父母姚伯春·姚廉氏·並介紹人華菊泉·等勾串詐財、附帶民訴、其起訴狀云、緣上年九月間、由華菊泉來說同鄉姚伯春夫婦、擬將其女才雲配人作爲小星、自訴人因爲兼姚父輩子嗣關係、允納爲妾、旋由若　往返商酌多次、得到才雲同意、於同年十月念六日、書立志願書、由自訴人出</p>
<p>茶禮千元　遂於十月三十一日租星與才雲同居、過門後、再給才雲存　洋四百元、用去衣飾雜物、約三百餘元、十二月九日、才雲歸寗母家、詎於日前忽接律師江一平來函、據謂代表姚瑞雲要求脫離關係、自訴人當卽檢查箱　、所有四百元存洋、以及衣飾、已　去一空、伏思姚才雲不過同居三十餘天、而騙去一千七百餘金之鉅、　所謂</p>
<p>串放白鴿　者、情節固顯然也、除庭呈證據外、爲此起訴鈞院、賜拘被告等到案、依照刑法三六三條科罪、并着交出姚才雲同居、否則請求追償洋一千四百元、曁價値三百餘元之衣飾雜物云云、法院據狀准詞、簽出傳票、派華捕郭祥堯飭傳、昨日下午、由詹良策推事蒞刑五庭集訊、四被告拘到、并延江一平·吳寳泰·兩律師辯護、卽據自訴人石彙信供稱、四十一歲、甬人、向爲銅鐵生意、余因家兄無子、年前病故、而余則祇育一子、故欲納妾、向人表示、</p>
<p>留意物色　以爲續嗣、去年九月間、余友袁錦春持一女子照片到來、謂此女係無錫人、名姚才雲、彼父母願作爲妾遂約期會晤、至十月二十六日、由袁錦春華菊泉及姚伯春夫婦帶同才雲等、同至某旅館開房間、經余前往　　認爲合格、被告等初　茶禮洋二千元、余祇允七百元、嗣以一千元議定遂由姚伯春夫婦出具筆據、介紹人簽字後、當給付洋一千元、偕姚女回去</p>
<p>租屋同居　祇三十九天、至十二月九日姚伯春夫婦來至余家、謂因滿月、須領才雲回去暫住、余以此係人情之常、故允之、詎至一月七號、忽接江一平律師來函、謂代表姚才雲要求與余脫離關係、但余平日對才雲之待遇頗優、白木耳等補品常備、今忽欲脫離、不知何故内中實有串放白鴿詐欺取財、因此起訴、要求着令</p>
<p>賠償茶禮　等洋一千七百元云云、、詰之姚才雲供稱、我確由父母作主、嫁與石爲妾、但當時因我年祇十七、身體發育未全、故議定過門後不得卽行同房、須隔兩年、并須入校求學、詎過門後、石并不照約履行、且於十月初八日卽强行同房、致我下部受傷、疼痛難忍、函招我母到滬、陪赴　龍章醫生處診治、騐得確已受傷、謂須過一百二十天、方可同房、醫治半月、傷勢稍痊、我母卽行回籍、詎石</p>
<p>淫念又起　於十一月初六日又欲作第二次强行同房、經我拒絕、石卽用手指硬挖、致又受傷、臥床數天、痛苦殊深、由石囑媒人函招父母到申、向石理論無效、故托江一平律師去函質問、查石不顧人道、强行同房、且待遇　劣、故現不願隨石回去云云、又據姚伯春夫婦供述一次、其詞大致與才雲相同、惟稱石已四十六歲、家有三子、二已成家、茶禮確曾收過一千元、對於存欵四百元及</p>
<p>衣飾等物　否認之、又據證人袁錦春供稱、向在金城銀行堆棧爲工頭、與石爲友、去年石因欲納妾、托我留心、某日華菊泉邀我雀戰、將女子照片一幀給閲、謂欲許配我、乃携歸給石閲看合式、遂托華函致無錫招姚伯春夫婦偕才雲來滬、在旅館内當面議定茶禮一千元、遂立據過門、其餘之事、不得而知、質之華菊泉供述一遍、末由兩造律師起立辯論良久、詹推　議本案辯論終結、定本月十七日宣判、</p>

<p>我是一個半出家式的　零女子。我五六歲的時候，母親死了，我的父親就把我送給一個蓄髮修行的　娘做了徒弟，住在一間破壞不堪的寺廟裏去出家。我那時不識不知，日日跟隨我的所謂師父念經，究竟那經裏所說的是什麽東西，我一豪都不懂。及至我長到了十餘歲的時候，我那師父就把寺裏的事情都要我　了。所有化米丨募　丨知客丨東奔丨西跑丨等等對外對内、一切的一切，俱是我一人担當起來，自晨至暮，忙過不了。我那個所謂師父祇是一味顢頇，坐享其成。她見我舉動活潑，勤勞耐苦，十分欣悅，就多方設法來籠絡我，使我死心塌地的爲她效忠。然她仍怕我不能終其身爲牛爲馬，所以不久她就給我收了一個徒弟，更加好言好語以安住我的心。從外面看來，覺得她對我確是十分親厚，可是她對於我的父兄則不甚喜　，甚至和我相善的戚友亦少加以青睞。　在我已二十餘歲了，在這十餘年的當中，由我個人的勤勞，（其實都是欺騙而來的結果）創起了一切的門面：　破的寺宇，由我修造的廟貎一新；剝落的佛像，由我裝塑得金身燦爛了。我本來早就覺悟到一個人要出家的緣故，無非是爲着中途命運不濟，迫而出此，倘果眞欲參禪悟道，就非確能清凈寂減不可，若像我這樣的勞苦，那裏是出家人的本色呢？况且用着我這樣的勞苦和努力的精神，在社會裏那怕得不到好的地位嗎？那麽，我又何苦要把自己有用的身體，埋沒在莫明其妙的去處，過那非人的生活，以畸零人而終其身呢？所以我决心　修寺裝像兩件事完成之後，盡了我一點　杯的志願，然後實行還俗，恢復本來自由。可是我那師父多方挾制，不肯放我出去，還要利用我作她的終身牛馬，使你不能翻身然後快！她現在已經知到我的心思了。她又自知到用假仁假義的技倆終不足以牢籠住我的，於是又用威嚇的手段，以死來要挾。據其對人表示，謂我若果私自走開，她就說我跟人逃走，報官拘捉，倘捉不回來，就說是我的父兄誘惑藏匿，興風作浪，要和我父兄打官司。這麽一來，我就沒法逃出她的圈套了。先生，我是一個女子，軟弱無知，那裏禁得起恐嚇呢？所以特提出下列的幾點疑問，願先生有以敎我罷：㈠出家人是有益於國家社會的，抑是有損於國家社會的呢？㈡出家人還俗，是否係一件不名譽的事？㈢出家人還俗，是否要先得師父的同意，抑或可以自由行動？㈣師徒之間，有無法律上的關係？㈤師父不願徒弟還俗，因而尋死，其徒應負法律上的責任否？㈥還俗不得師父許可，是否卽係私逃，因不願出家而私逃，應受法律的拘束否？㈦我自由還俗之後，師父能否向我父兄要人？（復信明日發表）</p>

<p>學校敎育及社會敎育的槪况</p>
<p>最先、我們因爲社會上不識字的人的衆多、實爲中國一切新的建設的最大的障礙、在整個的義務敎育沒有施行以前、不得不先就「廣設民衆學校」來着手做到「平民的義務敎育」的第一步、在這裏、我們可以把六年以前第一屆所設的民衆學校校數、和本所度所設的民衆學校校數來做個比較、</p>
<p>第一屆　二○校　畢業生三五四人</p>
<p>第七屆　五四校　畢業生一四五三人於此可見上海市政府成立以來之努力、在校數方面已增加將達三倍、而在畢業生方面亦已增加了四倍有餘、我們相信、再過數年、此項民衆學校當更有極度發展的必要、而不識字的民衆的苦痛的解除、和從「不識字的原因」上所產生的許多社會病態的减少、我們對於整個的社會建設的前途、是非常可以樂觀的、</p>
<p>此外、爲了要使若干商人工人在工餘之後得到知識的補益起見、又辦了補習學校若干所、也是完全免費的、此項補習學校亦已有五年的歷史、第一屆祇開辦四校、到現在已擴充到十九校、人數方面也由四十人而增至四百五十人、</p>
<p>從每年的學校數和學生數的增加的情形看來、顯然的可以明瞭我們對於社會敎育的注重與實施社會敎育所得到的有效的反應了、</p>
<p>第二、市敎育局對於社會敎育的實施、除了廣設免費的民衆學校與補習學校之外、還有下列的幾種設備、</p>
<p>㈠民衆敎育館丨内有「通俗演講」、「學術演講」、「民衆游藝」、「博物展覽」、「書報閲覽」等固定的工作、此外、並隨時舉行各種關於社會活動方面的集會、如「民衆遠足會」「演說競賽會」等等、</p>
<p>㈡圖書館丨現在市立圖書館祇有一所、成立僅一年、故内容未見十分充實、惟一切建築設備、頗費心力、擴充計劃亦有已定的步驟、預料不出五年、必可有急速的發展、</p>
<p>㈢流通圖書館丨此項流通圖書館、對於一般民衆頗見便利、因本市民衆均可將館中書籍借回閲讀、手續非常簡便、且並不收費、</p>
<p>㈣動物園丨動物園係新近創設、故内容亦未見充實、惟對於一般民衆、已感覺不少興趣、</p>
<p>㈤公共學校園丨此項公共學校園、係供給學生對於研究自然科學之助、一切自然敎科書中普通的植物應有盡有、不但學生在自然科學方面能够得到自修的便利和鑒賞的機會、並且還可以供給一部分市民公餘游憇之用、</p>
<p>㈥公共體育塲丨提倡體育、爲敎育當局所極注意的一件工作、所以、對於公共體育塲的設備、亦日有擴充、我們只見把公共體育塲的運動人數來做一個證據、就可以知道本市民衆對於體育方面的興趣的濃厚、和必然的效果的偉大、同時、因爲公共體育塲祇有一所、而本市區域甚爲遼闊、所以又分别在各區設立簡易公共體育塲六所、以便散處各區的民衆、都有鍛鍊身體從事運動的塲所、丨將來、此項簡易體育塲尙擬增設若干所、使體育成爲最普遍的訓練、</p>
<p>上面的幾種社會敎育方面的設備、都由市敎育局辦理、此外、本市民衆亦有不少私人創辦的民衆學校以及文化機關、很能帮助着公家對於社會敎育的設施、據最近統計如下、</p>
<p>圖書館　　　　十二職業傅習所　　五補習學校　　　十七文化敎育團體　四十四函授學校　　　三特殊學校（聾啞敎育）一共計　　　　　八十二此外、我們以爲社會敎育對於「公衆的娱樂」上有着特殊的意義、所以對於公衆娱樂方面、我們同時予以極度的注意、</p>

<p>好久未見好足球、且連天陰雨兼雪、昨日突然放晴、加以西聯足球會之佈告、故逸園之賓客竟甚濟濟、在三四千左右、以爲海軍中或有絞絞出色者、豈知仍一蹷不振、前鋒尙可、後衛大不行、前鋒以左翼杜列蘭最出色、勾送數脚、快而且準、頗可一看、後衛之軟弱、當東華前鋒攻入之時、手忙脚亂、不知所措、一時全塲鬥然、笑聲震野、</p>
<h3 id="c185">一來一往 <a href="#c185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>上塲海軍以取攻勢、雖進行不速、而攻逼則烈、常盤旋東華塲地、翼鋒時有遠射、戰後七分鐘、東華突破海軍、李義臣右角一遠送、陳虞添如飛而進海軍急起回追、虞添已抵敵門十五碼地、不慌不忙飛中網内、東華一比零勝、虞添又得一突破之機、未曾得手、海軍仍見攻烈、杜列蘭之中央一送、一頂幾乎中的、李義臣忽於門前二十五碼之處、手觸皮球、勃朗踼任意球、峻急如離絃、中右柱彈入門内、一比一各得一球、禮尙往來、應如是也、</p>
<h3 id="c186">頭上工夫 <a href="#c186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>此時之局勢、尙見緊張、東華漸見攻勢、但屢盜遠射、俱未見血、二十分鐘時、李義臣送陳虞添、陳得球直向前進、在角上向門前平踼一記、李義臣見機會當前、踼之不及、縱身一跳、頭頂適中皮球、球進門内、李則筆直仆於門前、掌聲雷動、不三分鐘、萬象華得李義臣傳、連破二關、斜向門射、竟又入網、東華以三比一大勝、</p>
<h3 id="c187">中堅顏色 <a href="#c187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>上半時尙有二十五分鐘、馮中堅運佑、亦上前助攻、亦射入一球、東華在海軍門前混戰、但無結果、海軍亦得一角球、照樣無效、家球一避、送與虞添、射亦不中、萬象華在左進襲、則得一角球機會、落於中央、馮運佑來的恰巧、趕上力射、其聲清脆而中、上半時東華四、海軍一、</p>
<h3 id="c188">又是一個 <a href="#c188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>下半時開始之五分鐘、海軍得一角球之後、萬象華又直衝而進、海軍門前、只有後衛史蒂芬一人、李義臣陳家球亦連袂趕到、極好之機會、竟唾手而失、馮運佑上前一托、海軍之守門、逼至出守、由後衛代勞、一時引得大笑、陳虞添之傳球、陳洪光卒攻入内、又加一個、東華勝五比一、</p>

<p>兩江女籃球球隊、將出征歐美、爲充實實力起見、特邀請東南健將參加、沈嗣良亦爲兩江出征、發表意見、彙錄於次、</p>
<p>邀請東南參加　兩江籃球隊、此次預備出征歐美、爲充實實力起見、該校校長陸禮華、面邀東南畢業生籃球健將潘月英·王志新·陸雪琴三女士加入、同赴美洲、三女士爲海上聞名籃球健將、潘月英之前鋒、王志新陸雪琴之後衛異曲同工、皆傑出人才、新浙江建設運動會中、潘王陸三女士、曾與兩江之前鋒陳榮明楊森、後衛黄淑華等代表上海混合隊與杭市混合隊表演、大爲會塲贊美、嘆爲觀止、潘王陸三女士、正在各徵家長之同意、並曾向東南校長余子玉及總務主任秦醒世商及、余秦兩女士、因事關國體、極爲贊助、希望爲國增光、一開中華女子籃球界之新紀錄云云、</p>

<p>國人從前遇　多是尙空論、不實行、和旁人做了我來批評、現在從這次兩江女校籃球隊歐美環遊一事看起來、却已經改過了不少、從兩江籃球隊的歷史和成績上觀察、就可知道他們是沒有尙空論不實行的毛病、他們只是從實際上用功夫、說了就做、不斷的埋着頭向前進、雖然他們在二十年戰勝了日本、可是絲毫沒有自滿的態度、却還是虚懷若谷、又要到歐美去觀摩各國體育、極融合他們的精粹、造成獨立精湛的體育、這一種宏大的抱負、深遠的眼光、艱難的工作、他們肯窮年累月、遠涉重洋的去幹、是多麽值得令人敬服、</p>
<p>他們的宣言裏說是勝負之算、非所計也、雖然是謙虚之辭、但是我們却不能以他們成敗、或憑我們自餒的推測、來做評判他們此行價值的標準、他們此次出國、正是國難重重、舉世觀測、我革命後中華民族生存能力的當兒、多少總能和總應給予外人一點新的刺激、使對我民族改變其觀念、其志固可嘉、其心亦良苦、正興慷慨赴敵無異其悲壯、相老人說、立自强之發軔爲男子之先驅、誠足說明其意義、</p>
<p>又自該校籌備進行以來國人亦能變換向來旁人做了我來批評的消極態度、特而爲積極的實際援助、各報披露此項消息後之與論、也都一致表示其熱烈的勉勵、因此我敢推斷國人、决能切實帮助他們成功、更望兩江籃球隊、𠗚勵奮發、負不要辜負國人的熱望、</p>

<p>闖着闖着，也不知闖了有多遠，竟給咱闖到一　小菜塲上來啦。喝！小菜塲上可眞擠軋哩！娘兒們，東一堆，西一淘，青菜羅　荳腐麵筋的儘跟那夥菜販子拌嘴，胳膊碰着籃兒，籃兒碰着秤兒的，眞牽絲攀　，咱擠在裏邊，捉空兒就伸出五將軍，揑一把　　，摸一把窩窩的，倒也挺有味兒。可總抵椿不掉咱的肚了餓！咱剛怙惙着，想溜開到别處去拉排頭，猛孤丁的就給咱撞見了兩個連擋弟兄，在那兒放三四，倒棺材。</p>
<p>嘻！這兩個傢伙眞行！居然到這兒來放生意啦。咱怎麽竟沒想到，那夥娘兒們全貪小利，只要放下鈎子，不怕吊不着魚。可是，巡風的在那兒？咱找了許久沒找着。難不成這兩個傢伙有着潑天大的膽，也不怕撈毛的擺路頭的，就出來做生意了嗎？咱悄沒聲兒的走上去，衝着那擺莊的就輕輕地呌：</p>
<p>「李四别子。」</p>
<p>李四别子一回頭，瞧見了咱，趕緊溜了個眼風，胳膊兒往後伸，給了咱兩隻小立司馬。咱知道他要咱跟他撬覇啦。得！咱就給你撬覇，回頭不怕你不劈把給咱。咱下手押三，就開了個三，押四，就開了個四，這麽押來押去，差點沒把李四别子手裏的小立司馬全搬到咱手裏來。圍着瞧熱閙的娘兒們可就擠上一大圈啦。</p>
<p>一個娘兒給了咱一隻小立司馬，要咱跟她押。咱一下手，就像撮戲法那樣，把一隻給撮成了兩隻。嘻！這匹魚可吊上啦！那娘兒的眼孔眞小，得了兩隻小立司馬，就眉花眼笑的自家兒來下手，也不要咱給帮塲啦。好！咱就瞧你押。押三開四，押四開三。抄總兒說一句，咱們三個人，一搭一擋的，把許多娘兒們腰包裏的買菜錢全搬了過來，纔收起傢生，讓那夥娘兒們恨圈兒紅的傻在那兒。</p>
<p>李四别子的良心倒不壞，一下塲，就在一條暗弄裏，分給咱八隻小立司馬。這麽多的把，咱可有多時沒挨着啦。咱今兒眞走運，闖一處就有一處利市發！這兩天咱儘啃鍋貼，嘴裏邊淡出鳥來，今兒可得換換口味。咱一下子就闖進一片陽春麵館裏去，喊了碗起碼湯麵，吃喝了一個暢快。</p>
<p>可是，偏財發得快，溜得也快。咱剛跑出了麵館，就碰見幾個賣油麻花跟鹹花生的小夥子，在一家門角邊的階沿上，叮叮噹噹的打銅子兒。咱一瞧見，心窩裏邊便活鯽鯽的，就也加進夥裏去。叮叮噹噹的打了三個鐘頭，打丢了咱兩隻小立司馬；再加買了幾顆烟泡，幾張土皮，咱的八隻小立司馬，就給劈成了五隻啦。</p>
<p>這五隻小立司馬，咱要是好好兒用，準可以用上十來天。咱把牠緊緊的塞在貼血袋裏，今兒咱可不想再放生意啦。（未完）</p>

<p>— 玄</p>
<p>據大陸報的統計，去年本埠賣座最佳的影片是同心結，人猿泰山，紅樓艶史，科學怪人，龍虎鬥，等五片。記得本年元旦南京大戲院開映　女天堂，第一塲開映前一小時已經連第二塲的票子都賣完。人猿泰山，科學怪人，龍虎鬥，以及蠻女天堂，都是所謂神怪蠻荒野獸的片子，都不是現實人生的題材。此種非現實人生的神怪蠻荒野獸影片，（乃至小說，）兩年前盛行於歐美，迄今未衰，而上海乃亦波及。</p>
<p>這意義就是一般市民渴想「逃避現實！」</p>
<p>爲什麽要逃避現實呢？因爲在這慘酷鬥爭的社會中感得無出路；因爲這沒落的資本主義社會已經「精神破產，」正像歐洲許多法西斯學者所悲痛地自白。從逃避現實中，我們看見了沒落階級的頽唐，徬徨，悲觀。這是他們下意識的流露！</p>
<p>而另一方面，因爲電影是普遍的大衆的藝術，統治階級必要利用之。他們曾經在銀幕上企圖欺騙民衆，例如一九二九丨三○年所出的許多「未來世界理想」的片子，（其中之一是Metropolis，中文譯名好像是科學世界；）他們又曾企圖爲第二次世界大戰「準備意識，」例如近年來層出不窮的「尙武」的戰事影片。而在此兩者之外，又巧妙地「廻避現實，」引導一般市民的眼光到神怪，野獸，蠻荒了。這是麻醉看客！</p>
<p>就因爲一方是有意地要廻避現實，而另一方面，丨丨一般市民的觀衆，是下意識地要逃避現實，而於是神怪野獸蠻荒的影片賣座極佳了！</p>
<p>然而也就在這上頭，我們看出了世界統治階級的手忙脚亂，以及在他們「敎育」下一般小市民的迷惑彷徨，頽唐悲觀。</p>
<h3 id="c203">印度寡婦殉葬的奇俗 <a href="#c203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>— 萬居</p>
<p>寡婦殉葬是印度人那種奇異的貞操觀念的產物，也可說是印度文明的特色。這事不知起自何時，我們翻讀吠陀經，還找不到有這條規訓，可見在古代的印度並沒有這種慘酷的風俗。不過在「彪拉哪」（印度古史）裏面就有這樣的記載了：「寡婦能登上安放着丈夫的遺骸的火葬壇，就是貞節的女子，她死後便可以入天堂。假如丈夫死後，寡婦還生存下去，尤其是再嫁，那麽她來生便沒有跟隨在丈夫身邊的資格」。因有着這種荒謬的傳說，所以才發生這種慘無人道的風俗。現代雖有許多人對於這種陋俗加以秤擊，然而印度的寡婦們縱不殉葬，却亦不敢再嫁；雖偶然也有例外的，但是寥若晨星。一八二九年十二月四日印度總督威廉。麥丁克曾頒佈一條法律，絕對地禁止焚殺寡婦，違者處以死刑。可是當這條法律實施的時候，曾意外地遇着重大的阻礙：一般無智識的婦女，受了僧道的誘惑，竟高聲大呌願被焚殺以殉其夫：因此當局不得不讓她們自由行動。假使政府眞的採取强硬的禁止手段，也許會惹出嚴重的亂子來呢。幸而後來寡婦的親戚曾提出聲明書，說明他們並不堅持焚殺寡婦，因此當局復重申禁令，而英屬印度此種風俗便逐漸消失了。但在一八六○年的變亂後，奥爾慈地方又公然地焚殺寡婦，結果犯罪者被處死刑；一八七五年拉克奴地方又有此種非人道的舉動發生，法庭以殺人罪起訴，判處有關係者三十人以死刑。以後英屬印度此風遂不復見，然而在土人的諸候國裏，却還沒有方法可以制止。</p>
<p>當要舉行焚殺的辰光，遠近不期然而然地聚集着許多人來看這種祭禮。寡婦宛如新娘子似的盛裝豔服，由她的近親扶持着，僧道和宗敎迷信者把她團團地圍住，不幸的寡婦便在音樂的交奏中被引到火葬塲去了。由家裏到火葬塲的路上撒舗着樹葉，花束和棕櫚。如果這將要殉葬的寡婦還有氣力的話，一面走，一面還抛錢給路旁的乞丐，不過大部份的寡婦在那時候神智已完全昏迷了；因爲當舉行殉葬之前，常有人飲以印度大麻製成的一種麻醉劑的緣故。</p>
<p>在那極悽慘的沉默中，羣衆團團地圍着火葬壇。寡婦徐徐地繞壇三匝後，僧</p>

<p>— 張平</p>
<p>她擁着他上了從二樓梯。他也順著勢，踏上了梯段。走到他的房裏來時，他才注意到她只穿一件絨質的白色睡衣，雪白的胸口還露出一大塊，下面是穿着一條短花條褲，自膝下，全脛部都露出來了。</p>
<p>「這是何等動人的姿態喲！」</p>
<p>他又忘却了當前的難局，而只在乘勢像貪䬸着般地賞玩她的半裸的姿態。</p>
<p>「啊呀！難爲情死了喲！」</p>
<p>她笑了，伸出雙掌來掩着臉，像小姑娘般地一翻身，跑向下面去了。</p>
<p>看見她走了後，他的頭腦才漸冷靜下來。他覺得剛才的舉動實在是太鹵莽了。向他們道歉麽？堂堂的中華大國民是做不到的。寗願守土而死，决不肯由自已手中喪失寸土！但是儘住在這裏，在戰略上也是不妥當的。誰能料得着這個難局將怎樣地展開呢？</p>
<p>「三十六着，走爲上着！······」</p>
<p>他想到這裏，便急忙忙地把鞋襪穿好，再扣好了外衣，什麽也不能檢了，只帶了必要的錢包，牙刷，和毛巾，便向樓下衝來。幸得在途中沒有碰着鶴子夫人，也沒有看見娘姨。他走出弄堂口，忽然看見和那個日本佬同來的美麗的姑娘仍然是穿着華彩的日本服，手裏棒着四個磚頭形的麵包，從那一頭走來。她看見海泉，一樣的是笑吟吟地向他鞠了一鞠躬。</p>
<p>「這眞是天仙化人啊！」</p>
<p>他感着許多可恥的矛盾，但不能不回了一個禮。他急急地跑到電車路口來了。</p>
<p>「那個老貨是她的父親，那末那個小姑娘是她的妹妹了，不錯吧，一點不會錯的。」</p>
<p>他想着，又自慚起來，全精神還是受着她的支配啊。他不禁又嘆了口氣。</p>
<p>道便把她扶上安放她的丈夫的屍首的地方。在距離屍首數步的處所，使她盤脚坐着；有時還把死者的頭放在寡婦的膝上。隨後便把她縛在火葬壇的柴堆上。有的儘量地灌油，有的趕忙地點火。舉火後，僧道就高聲誦經並唱聖詩，親友則開始號哭，四面奏起喇叭和大鼓。這樣的騷擾就可以使那悽慘的哀呌聽不見。萬一那寡婦被火燒痛起來，把索子弄斷，跳出猛火奔逃的話，殘酷的僧道便急起追捉，把她再投入火中。</p>
<p>寡婦如有避免自身悲慘的運命的企圖，那麽僧道和她的親族們便認爲是兇兆，是最不祥的事，死人的靈魂因此不會成佛。有時因怕寡婦抵抗，當她登上火葬壇的時候，人們還用着大而且重的竹竿壓在她的肩上，使她無法站起來。</p>
<p>羣衆當火葬壇還在微微燃燒着的中間，便默默地四散了。通常寡婦的身體都沒有完全燒盡，親族們便把祭壇和遺骸收拾起來，一塊兒埋葬了。</p>
<p>這種悲慘殘酷的習俗雖出於宗敎的迷信，但夫婦一體的觀念也是一個重要的因素！</p>

<p>— 彭雪珍女士</p>
<p>眞不懂我爲什麽這樣地厭惡蘇州，雖然我老在這一塊天地中生活。</p>
<p>我喜歡壯偉邁，喜歡那些直爽乾脆的人的氣息。在蘇州，我是失望了的。沒一樣不講究秀美，人們像淨糖揑成的，又粘又活靈，血氣是談不到的，一般的人安閒得和死水一樣，一動也不動，像沒有什麽活的源頭似的蘇州人的看家性特别强，稍有點兒飯吃的人便誰也不想往外跑。爲着生活的舒適，近年來外省人來蘇州住家的倒眞不少。</p>
<p>在蘇州，沒有職業的公子老爺們特别多，他們可以不費一點兒心力，挨過那漫漫長日。茶館，酒店，生意興隆，大概也就是這緣故。閒着沒事，買點字畫玩玩，請人拍拍曲子，當當票友；烟，賭也點綴着這散淡的生活。蘇州的女人也和如今一般的摩登女子差點兒，多少帶着些二十世紀的林黛玉的氣息。</p>
<p>除了僅有的幾條馬路，以外的道路大半都是石子鋪成的，走遠點便脚痛；在細雨迷濛的日子，那滑勁兒眞可以，但這是只有用脚走路的人才知道。</p>
<p>早上八點鐘左右，是少爺小姐們坐着車上學的時候了丨當然不坐車的也有。十字街頭滿是等着做買賣的車夫們。</p>
<p>老虎灶門前，清早特别忙，泡水的姑娘婆婆們全站滿了，一邊等着，一邊說着閑話，先到的便提着滿滿的水壺打回頭在街道上躑躅着。孩子們在門前追逐，半根油條便滿足了一切，總是咧着嘴兒笑。不會走的孩子站在屋門口，牆角邊凝睇，唇角上掛着兩條鼻涕。</p>
<p>蘇州人眞太安閒了，連用人和小孩都現着安閑的樣子。他們好像全都在作夢，在夢境中逗留着似的。啊，時代的怒濤要幾時才會衝醒這般安閑的，整天在作夢的蘇州人呢！</p>

<p>「木耳」爲菌類，性凉，產於四川等處、以其寄生於樹木之上，形似耳狀，故名木耳，高莊；如四川耳，馬蘭坪耳，堰耳，等，有標準之目。其色烏亮，大朶多，片張薄，體質輕，屑子什質少，身份乾。其次爲上中莊；如河口耳，谷城耳，宜昌耳，興安耳，等，質地大都相同，所差在大朶少，色次，或屑子重，有什質。河口耳，則片張較厚。最次，爲南漳耳，陽坪耳，其劣點爲片張厚而體重，屑子什質均多，陽坪耳更帶有泥沙，可謂耳中之最下者。</p>
<p>「功用」大都用以佐餐，但其性凉滋潤，可以補陰，雖不及白銀耳之佳，然多食亦有相同之功效，</p>
<p>「食法」以水發透，將耳邊撕去佐餐，專用耳根，洗之絕凈，以水炖透，然後再加冰糖食之，頗有特味，不亞銀耳，</p>

<p>— 瞻廬</p>
<p>北平，不是斬加着文化城的榮譽　？呼聲甚高的古物南遷一旦實行以後，文化城不是虚有其表麽？爲着這問題，反對的聲浪正在洶湧之中，其實文化南遷，這是無須反對的；我且從北平的文化南遷，而感想到東三省的武化，可惜沒有南遷！掉南　文言，呌做：「文化之幸歟？武化之不幸歟？」</p>
<p>要是，九一八事變不曾發生以前，東北當局也似今日愛護文化　的愛護武化，把所有關於武化的飛機槍械子彈，充量的向南方遷移，那麽就可以增加一二八的抗日力量，使敵人受着更重大的創痕。</p>
<p>昔日的武化沒有南遷，現在的文化不得不從速南遷了；北方的學者當然不顧文化的南遷，南方的學者郤對於文化南遷呐喊着無上榮幸的口號。</p>
<p>榮幸在那裏？榮幸這「亂世文章不值錢」的時代，居然一變其尙武習慣，而成爲右文的精神！文學家不是要抬頭了麽？昔日的武化不值得南遷，值得面遷只有北平的文化，只有北平的故宮文化，誰說世界不太平呢？重文輕武，便是太平的象徵啊！南方的考古家，金石家，文藝家，以及一切搦着筆桿兒的先生們，一定很熱烈的呐喊着千載一時的文化南遷！</p>
<p>文化南遷，比着宋儒說的「吾道南行」，尤其萬分的榮幸。</p>

<p>— 百合</p>
<p>丨尋軋頭，拆梢</p>
<p>上海有許多白相人，大亨，一天到晚，在馬路上厮混。有穿着釘鞋，掮着雨傘的鄕下土老兒，探頭探腦，東張西望的走過，給大亨一眼看見，走過去望鄕下土老兒身上一撞。這種行爲，大亨的口號，呌做「尋軋頭」。「尋軋頭」之後，駡幾句「猪　，棗子（眼也）沒帶出來麽？的你爲甚麽，將我撞一下？」接着，就奉上二下巴掌。結果，鄕下土老兒由肚兜袋裏挖出雪白大洋錢，孝敬了大亨，還要賠上一百二十個不是，大亨才高抬貴手，歪戴着帽子，駡一聲「猪　，便宜你，下次走路識相些。」　　我國的東北事件，活像鄕下土老兒，遇到了上海大亨。你瞧，九一八南滿路被炸，究竟是何人炸壞的？不問可知，這是「尋軋頭」。接着便提出警告，這分明是自已撞了人，還要駡人「猪玀·········爲甚麽撞我？」警告之後，不等交涉，馬上就發生軍事行動，這宛如上海大亨的不等鄕下土老兒申辯，二下巴掌，早已飛過來了。可憐我們中國，不折不扣的，正活像一個鄕下土老兒，吃了二下巴掌，不聲不響地把肚兜袋裏的東西，一古腦兒放棄了。可惜還沒有賠上一百二十個不是，大亨還以爲「不識相」，否則，大亨早已歪戴着帽兒走開了，或許不至於有熱河之戰。</p>
<p>蘇俄外長李維諾夫氏，在日内瓦軍縮總委會曾主張明定侵略界說，駁斥實行侵略的種種荒謬理由，說得入情入理。其結句說，「視戰爭爲保障和平之方法，則武裝衝突中，將永無所謂侵略國矣。」鄕下土老兒聽了這話，津津有味。但不知國際大亨聽了，作何感想？</p>

<p>我們孫總理救國救民的三民主義，大都曉得是從林肯演說詞中（Ofthepeople,bythepeople,forthepeoole）發揮而來的，在下今亦從英文中fomloveinlovewithlove而討得了一部人生寫眞的三愛主義，其意就是自愛而生，與愛而活，由愛而死，待我把它引證於下，</p>
<p>這是在聖經上說得千眞萬確的，當亞當與夏娃在上帝的果園中偷吃了蘋果之後，他倆就懂得了空前所無的愛情，遂愛的一切，嗚呼哀哉，戀愛的失敗與成功，終不出於一死！</p>
<p>自愛而生，與愛而存，爲愛而死，稱之爲人生的三部曲，誰曰不宜？</p>

<p>丨僞道德家的傑作丨</p>
<p>在做新聞記者的時期裏，幾乎沒有一天不向公安局去探索關於社會發現的事件。最使我不能忘懷的，是城隍廟附近搜獲了的一對青年男女。我最不滿於社會新聞一向流習於下層低級趣味的意識，我不能把它發表，在我的觀察上，實在也不算是「新聞」。</p>
<p>是夏天某日的黄昏時候：某君穿着紅白相間的汗衫，長及肚腹；下面着了一條藍色邊緣的白短褲，顯然兩條毛腿，並沒有掩護的毛絨襪。像是運動員的裝束，他的同伴的一位小姐，年輕得很，穿了紅色薄綢旗袍，外面罩了高領的最流行的新式大衣，兩人那樣肩擦肩的從新北門走進來。誰知道馬上給街上的浪人，集中包圍起來了，愈聚愈多，使旁人都好奇地呌起來：</p>
<p>「看！大家看，這對奇形怪狀的不要　···」於是聲音龐雜而高漲，人頭像田野裏的瓜，在嚷聲裏浮沉。結果，爲了有損道路秩序，警士不客氣地就請伊們進公安局去，警長對我說；「奇妝艶服，提倡淫風，罪有應得。」並且要我把這事登報。我沒有話說的笑了。我怎能當此爲「新聞」呢！</p>

<p>月亮得很，是冬夜；沒有一顆星，天體流着澄藍的光。</p>
<p>排在岸上的一丈多高的老梧桐，疏疏落落掛着幾點黑而帶焦的殘葉，給私語似的料峭的夜風在嘲笑。低低地舖在樹脚下的各種快要死去的雜草裏，也飛出輕幽的悲泣一樣可憐的語調。官路枯燥着臉丨泥土也龜裂了；白的一條，像銀蛇，不過因上面被風吹碎着的樹枝樹葉擺動的緣故，倒畫在它身上以生動不息的怪謎似的意境。</p>
<p>總之，是一個凍冷了世間的冬之夜。有錢家庭裏的男男女女，都圍着火爐在閒談。</p>
<p>忽然官路上晃着一團淡淡的影子，像遊魂那樣的飄忽，但漸漸影子深黑了，聽得出咳嗽的聲音，不過很輕，繼着，連脚步的聲音也清楚起來了。近周的蟲語，好像怕被人發覺似的；完全息止了。這裏，只有風葉的聲音，脚步的聲音，偶然還聽到老人似的乾咳。</p>
<p>月光裏倒底立刻發現了混江龍李四。他的貓頭鷹一樣發亮的一對小眼，壓在范陽破氈帽的帽檐下，糢糊地在找尋路子。頸是縮在兩個高聳着的肩胛間，像怕寒冷，是的，他的酒糟紅鼻子下顯然游着濃碧的涕水。</p>
<p>他走得很快，雖然異樣地費力。背上的漁網和手裏緊揑着的魚叉，腰裏搭着的一個魚簏，裝成鄕村裏最蠻野的一種職業者的打扮。</p>
<p>『該死，這悍潑婦，害死老子這一輩子！」他悶得夠了，斜豎着眼，吐出輕微的駡聲。接着咬緊牙齒，呵了一口冷氣，依舊沿着官路向北走去。在他思想裏，幻演出他老婆姘了别人屢次和他齟齬之後逃走等等的回憶。㈠</p>
<p>種下愛的種子，等到瓜熟蒂落的時候，就產下了一班人子人孫，換一句話說，人類的來源，就是他倆愛情的結晶了，</p>
<p>我們旣在未出世之前，就種下了愛的根苗，到了成人之後，自然也跳不出愛神的手掌，所以男女一到十六七歲，就不敎也懂得什麽是愛情，並且很會去實習它，更會呼一聲「甜心呀」「親愛呀」於是愛天愛地，在愛神手掌中生活，</p>
<p>戀愛成功則如何？當然快活得要死！戀愛失敗則如何？當然心痛得要死！於是或呑安神水，或跳黄浦江，以求解脫</p>

<p>— 氷玉</p>
<p>古時，有一對猪，並臥在村莊附近的野原上，天空中飛來一隻老鷹。那老鷹的腹中，飢餓得很，看見下面有兩隻肥猪，要想一舉攫取了。他在空中翺翔了一會，突然的張開兩爪望下，向兩隻猪背上猛力的一攫，左爪抓入雄猪的背肉裏，右爪抓入雌猪的背肉内，那兩隻猪都被驚醒，覺得背上痛極了，拚命的狂奔亂　。這時老鷹的兩爪因爲都抓入兩猪的背裏，不能脫出，遂爲兩隻猪分裂兩足而死。所以古來有「饑鷹裂股而死」的一句俗諺，就是　喻爲了慾望太貪而死的意義。現在社會上的人，也是同饑鷹一般的貪慾，以致送命的，實在不少啊！</p>

<p>金魚是魚類中，中看不中吃的東西。在浙江蘭谿，有關於金魚的一段故事，據說：從前有一家人家，僅母女二人，伶仃孤苦，度日維艱。那女兒生性至孝，每天到外邊去做些小生意，博得一些微薄的利息，以奉老母；但伊自己每因所入不够二人一飽，常是餓着，不敢告訴老母。有一次在冬天，正當大雪粉飛，伊照例到外冒着雪去做伊的生意，那知呌喊了終日，沒有一個主顧，那麽一連數天，老母餓得呻吟在牀，伊急得只是哭了。伊下意識的衝動，哀求上蒼的垂憐，伊又想着到伊屋後的小溪中去捕幾條魚，聊以充饑吧。伊哀苦地哭着，滴出了鮮紅的血淚，蹣跚地往屋後的小溪邊走去。那知這時伊的孝思，已感動了天公，落下了無數的金色的小魚在小溪中。伊到了溪邊，見游魚成羣，閃爍着金色的鱗片，伊非常驚奇；人間那裏有過這種魚呢？伊釣了幾尾，那知這魚出了水便死了，更奇怪的那金色的小魚已成爲塊然的黄金！伊快樂而且驚諤，料想必是神助吧，伊飛奔去告訴了老母，回頭把這黄金變为米　。以後伊家裏　了這小溪中的金魚漸漸已成了充裕的家庭。不料後來伊們把這事洩之於外，遠近的人都來搶奪金魚，强的打倒了弱的，少的打死了老的，這時天公又知道了，大慨是用了一些仙法吧，從此之後，在水中是金魚，到岸上還是金魚，就是這金魚的金色，不能如黄金般的可以變賣了。</p>

<p>業餘週刋不惜犧牲其寳貴的篇幅，特地爲失業者闢一「自我職業介紹」欄，這種熱忱，已經値得我們敬佩；而編者先生有時還讓出「編餘」的地位，刋登許多介紹職業的義務廣告，尤覺可感！</p>
<p>我們在這義務廣告中，看見許多謀事者，有的曾任過編輯敎員的人，現在願意得一個汽車夫的位置；有的對於辦理書記簿記游刃有餘的人，現在願意充當茶房工役聽差：還有大學的學生，不計較薪水，得價便賣。我對於這些苦朋友，除表示「惺惺相惜」的同情而外，同時覺得我自已現在就着一個小職業，不曾被擠落在失業者隊伍裏，走到飢餓線上去，不能不喊一聲「僥倖！」，丨丨雖然我現在這個小職業，祇能呌我半飢半飽。</p>
<p>「失業」的確是現在我們中國，不，全世界，一個非常嚴重的問題。如果這個嚴重問題，沒有適當的解决，讓牠這樣一天一天的嚴重下去，將來不知道要釀成怎樣一個悲慘的結果！</p>
<p>我雖然深深的替失業沒飯吃的苦朋友憤慨，同時也深深替席豐履厚窮奢極慾的老爺太太少爺小姐們危懼，你們如果眞個逼得他們不能生存，呌他們活活的餓死，他們到那時候，也决不會讓你們好過；因爲他們在世間上也有生存的權利呵！</p>
<p>一人向隅，尙且滿座爲之不歡；你們看着許多同是圓顱同是方趾的同類，困苦顚連，奄奄欲斃，能不動心嗎！</p>
<p>在我看，你們爲自利利人起見，也不容漠視這個「失業」的嚴重問題，大家應當日夜勞神焦思，快快求一個適當的解决辦法呵！</p>
<p>要得天下太平，除非大家有飯吃，雖然一時不能達到有福同享的大同境界，至少限度，也不能使世界上有一個失業的人，就是說不能使世界上有一個餓着肚皮的人。</p>

<p>— 宗文</p>
<p>好奇怪，在上海這許多工廠的工人，女性倒要佔一大半。這未始不是個好現象丨社會上的女子職業，誰說不發達？　　男工的工資已是夠少了，但女工的工資，却又要比男工約少一角左右，以致終日辛勞，還不能得一飽。至於工作時間，竟有多至十四小時的。每晨五時頭次汽管響，起身吃早飯；五時半第二次汽管響，開廠門，進廠；六時第三次汽管響，閉廠門，上工：到十二時休工一小時，用午膳：下午一時再上工，直到晚上五六點鐘才停手。如紗廠，機器是日夜不休的。此外更有夜工。雖然夜工另有工資，但往往有許多的女工，因想多得些工資，以致做得精疲力盡，過勞而斃命的。這眞是一件可慘的事！</p>
<p>工廠的規則很是嚴厲。管工的個個都似狼虎般的，作威作福，無所不爲：常無理打駡工人，扣她們的工資，甚或開除她們；尤其可惡的，是於放工時在廠門口任意檢查工人，一味地玩弄她們以取樂。</p>
<p>她們每天放工回家，還須煑飯燒菜，養男育女，洗滌全家的衣服。一年三百六十五天，每天除了睡覺幾個小時以外，簡直沒有休息的時候。所以她們的痛苦較男工爲尤甚。</p>
<p>女性有好美的天性，但做女工的限於經濟，不能使她獲得充分的發展，而且爲了經濟的壓迫，往往有許多的女工，墮落而兼操賣淫的生活的。</p>
<p>唉！女工的生活委實太可憐了！究應如何改良之處，尙希本刋讀者諸君大家來討論一下。</p>

<p>他們聽了落雨，爲什麽都嘆氣，原來有這樣一個原因。</p>
<p>Ａ常常把他們每月的生活，劃成四個時代，好像歷史家把過去的史實劃成幾個時代一樣，這也是依着他自已的經濟原理的。</p>
<p>Ａ說：在拿薪水後的第一個星期，呌做洋鈿時代，因爲在這時代中，付飯錢，把房錢，還債，有時還買雙鞋子等等，用出去的，都是洋鈿，所以，呌做洋鈿時代。第二個星期呢，洋鈿雖然不多了，可是化成角子，倒還有一些，買兩塊巧克力糖，坐兩次洋車，還可以稍稍的舒服一下，用出去的，多是角子。第三個星期呢，就完全用銅板了，最多也不過化一百文錢去買一些糖炒粟子吃吃，在這個銅板時代中，還可敷敷衍衍的過去。等到第四個星期，荷包裏已是空空如也，連坐電車的錢都很爲難，只好「寅吃卯糧」的東挪西借，這吃卯的時代，生活就有些凄慘了。</p>
<p>『倒霉！連電車錢都沒有的吃卯時代中，老天還要下雨！』Ａ在床上狠狠地呌着。</p>
<p>·····························</p>
<p>時間在靜默中依然是過去丨過去丨過去丨時計的小針已正正的指着八點，風雨之聲格外響亮得透過了窗欞，Ａ和Ｂ於是不得不爬起身來。</p>

<p>出店生活</p>
<h3 id="c265">傭役中的一種特殊階級 <a href="#c265" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e265" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">265</a></h3>
<p>— 施彬</p>
<p>出店是傭役中的一種特殊階級，他們的職務是内外兼顧的，旣要送信，又要整理公司裏的一切雜務。這樣說來，他們的生活是似乎很忙碌的了。其實，大多數的出店，眞要比一般埋首案頭的勞心朋友寫意得多吧。他們在有信送出的時候，即出去跑了一次，回來了打掃一回就得了。空閑時就幾個人聚在一起的高談闊論。他們的生活，比之我們天天守着寫字　。見了洋大人就噤若寒蟬的眞要安閒得多呢。即以薪水而論，有的做先生的反不及他們。</p>
<p>出店們的薪水是沒有一定標準的，大槪均視服務的年數而定。有幾個做上十餘年出店的，其薪水亦有百餘元左右。這個數目較之一般商人的收入固然不大，但是我們要知道，他們的收入並不是全靠一些固定的薪水，他們最重視的郤是額外的收入。有時額外的收入竟會超過固定的薪水。譬如到了陰曆的節邊，先生們所給予的節賞，在範圍大的寫字間或公司裏，一個出店有時竟可分派得七八十元之多，比之一般每到節邊急得走頭無路的朋友，快樂得多呢。即以平時而論，有許多做進出口的行家，他們每到月底，把額外的收入分派，而出店也有被分派着的。</p>
<p>他們除了上述的兩項收入外，善於賺錢的出店有時更兼營着别的生意，如販賣糖果或點心，到了夏天又販賣汽水，或美女牌冰𤈄漣，以供先生們的需要，這也是生財的大道。</p>
<p>出店的生活的確是無憂無慮，不過有時郤也很擔風險。譬如有幾位信用昭著的老出店，常要帶整千整萬的銀元解往銀行，或支出，偶一不愼，每易誤事。幸而他們樸實的衣着，不致引起歹人的注意，否則使要受累了。</p>
<p>出店又名苦力（coolie)，有時也呌僕歐（boy)。但這兩個名詞都是不很正確的。你想，他們雖是勞力者，查並不是像扛夫那樣地辛苦。至於僕歐，　是西人對於一般傭役的總名稱，但細細地想來，做出店的人，他們的行齡至少都在三十以上，實已夠不上稱僕歐的資格，而西人所稱的僕歐係指一般年齡較輕的練習生，或酒排間中的侍者而言。</p>

<p>「莫笑農家臘酒渾</p>
<p>豐年留客足鷄豚」</p>
<p>丨陸放翁</p>
<p>不錯，豐衣足食，喝飽了老酒，說幾句風凉話，塗幾首無聊詩，誰都會着。留客？臘酒？鷄豚？老實說吧，到農村經濟破壞盡了的現在，事實篝訴我們這些早已是不可能的了。像往日鄕下的伯父，每年必自釀黄酒，但近年來連黄酒的缸兒也不知到那裏去了。奇怪嗎？我問他近年這不是很來黄酒爲何不造，他沒有說話，就長歎了一聲：</p>
<p>「造酒？好容易的事！米那裏來呢？田中收　的，連自已一家兒也不夠吃。豐年的時候，平均每畝收穀四石，一碰到壞年世，二石一石也收不到，像今年米價這樣的賤，每斛祇賣到四五元，還要去掉地主的租錢，荳餅錢，還有什麽田捐啦，門户捐啦······。一畝共賣到十多元，你想，去了這麽多的錢，還有好處的餘地嗎？我今年已六十歲了，從沒有見過像近年來這樣逼人的世局。我在年青的時候，肉莊上一個猪頭祇賣二百多文，租錢每畝祇七百文，假使不幸生了病，請一位醫生祇一二百文。生活程度那麽低，但到了年底，有許多人家仍不能過活呢！借債，還債，典衣裳······。近年來，唉！更不要說了······」</p>
<p>耆年的伯父，當然不會對我說半句謊。你看呵，目下的農村狀况是如何的衰落啊！留客？試問呌他們拿什麽來留呢？</p>
<p>列强的侵略，壓迫，軍閥不息的内戰，資本家向着一羣可憐的工人背上狠命的榨取血汗，貪官污吏向着無數貧困的農民身上盡量的刮脂　，一切的一切，都要結束勞苦大衆的生命！</p>

<p>— 王懺摩</p>
<p>這時，大約是下午四點鐘光景，鉛色的彤雲在天空中滿佈着，雪花給怒吼的西北風捲成一團團的落下來，大地上差不多堆得一尺多厚了。到拜泉去的路上一片白色，不要說看不見人影兒，簡直連一個飛禽走獸都沒有。但，不一個大樹林裏，離開中間一條通行的大道不遠的地方，左右兩邊似乎散開三百多全身雪白的人，每一個人的臉上全是很焦急的樣兒，彷彿是約好了朋友，過了規定的時間，朋友還沒有來，心裏怪着急的一般。</p>
<p>「天快晚了，怎麽還不來喲？别是報告的人弄錯了日子了罷？」</p>
<p>「可不是麽？我們昨天下午奉了命令，上這兒來埋伏；據說今天最遲到吃午飯的時候，那些矮東西就得來啦。怎麽這會兒還不來啊？」</p>
<p>「别是矮東西已經知道了罷？」</p>
<p>「不能罷？你們瞧，這麽大的雪，路上沒有一點兒痕跡，並且飛機又沒有來偵視過，怎麽會知道我們在這兒等他們呢？」</p>
<p>「這就透着奇了。上拜泉去的路，非得從這兒走不行。要不然，準是報告的人弄錯了。」</p>
<p>「别嚷啦，你們聽，這是什麽聲音喲？」</p>
<p>「不像飛機聲，準是裝猪的汽車來啦！」</p>
<p>「對了，這些矮東西準是吃飽了飯才來的，預備在晚上到拜泉去跟我們幹······」</p>
<p>汽車在雪地上行動的喳···喳···喳···聲和馬達震動聲夾着西北風遠遠的送了過來。這些弟兄們像獵狗似的豎起耳朶傾聽着，果然，聲音是越來越近了。每一個人血管裏的熱血馬上給殺敵的興奮燃燒得沸騰起來，眼睛裏也閃爍着勇敢而愉快的光輝。他們會意的互相微笑了一笑。在一聲命令之下，兩邊的弟兄們各人準備好了各人的槍械，等敵人來送死。</p>
<p>五輛汽車和兩輛裝甲車，和長蛇一樣的尾接尾的往樹林裏開了進來。五輛汽車上，大約每輛平均有三十多個日本兵，全是縮緊了脖子，嘰嘰咕咕的談笑着。第一輛裝甲車領着頭衝進樹林裏，才走了一小半路，最後一輛裝甲車也到了埋伏在兩邊的弟兄們的火線内了。這些弟兄們的手指全按着槍機，心裏在想，無論誰的鉛丸第一顆飛了出去，那些　東西的命運就定了。然而，他們還是等着，等着，等着長官的命令丨等着第一聲的迫擊砲響了以後，便是他們的機會　了。</p>
<p>輛車子已經到了完全被弟兄們包圍的範圍裏了。第一輛裝甲車，便在他們預先掘好了的窟　裏面倒了下來。就在這一瞬間，一聲震耳的　　的聲音打破了上拜泉去的路上的沉寂。一顆砲彈飛到裝甲車上面，便擊毀了汽缸，沒有等到敵人還手，跟着右面又飛來一顆砲彈，車子前面所有的物件全轟去了。</p>
<p>遭了這種出於意料之外的攻擊，敵人手忙脚亂的，取槍的取槍，架機關槍的架機關槍，一個個全跳下了車子，散在車子旁邊還擊的時候，已經有四五十個敵人的肉體裏做了鉛丸的永久的歸宿處了。我們的四尊迫擊砲的目標全在那七輛車子上面，所以除了兩輛裝甲車上的機關槍還在向四面射擊着，那五輛汽車完全轟毀了。</p>
<p>這樣互相轟擊了許多時候，黑夜已經降臨，一點點的火星在黑暗中閃爍着：硫磺的氣味，使得每一個人室息。那兩輛裝甲車上的機關槍經不住砲火全集中在上面，不多一會兒，就轟毀了，跟着敵人的火力也不像先前那麽大了。弟兄們在長官的衝鋒令之下，便從兩邊包抄上去。雨點一般的鉛丸密密的往敵人那面射去，雄壯的喊殺聲在雪夜裏像雷聲似的震動着······</p>
<p>敵人不知道我們的弟兄們究竟有多少，只覺得四面全有鉛丸飛過來：開始的時候，兩輛裝甲車上的機關槍沒有被轟毀以前，心裏雖害怕，還希望裝甲車能往前衝鋒，打開一條血路，但是後來裝甲車上的機關槍停止射擊以後，就完全失望了，知道今天死的機會比生的希望多啦。等到我們的弟兄們衝鋒的當兒，那已經死了一半的敵人，在一陣猛烈的火力下掙扎了好一會兒，忽然，對面的鉛丸不飛過來了，只聽得雪地上起了一陣雜亂而急促的走路聲，看見閃爍的大刀映着雪花發出寒光，於是敵人的機關槍和快槍全加緊了射擊，希冀擊退了衝鋒過去的弟兄們。我們的弟兄們躺倒了一排，馬上又是一排塡了上去，舞着大刀，拿着手溜彈，這樣一排又一排的踏着自已弟兄們的屍體衝過去。敵人的機關槍有的被手溜彈炸毀了，有的給弟兄們奪過來，倒轉槍口向敵人掃射，霍霍的刀光飛濺着大和魂的血，灑在白皚皚的雪地上，怪鮮艶的······</p>
<p>槍聲漸漸的疏了···終於完全停止了。在救護受傷的弟兄們的當兒，每一個弟兄們的臉上浮起得意的微笑。</p>
<p>雪花還是給怒吼的西北風捲成一團團的落了下來，往拜泉去的路上，有一個二百多人的隊伍踏着雪喳···喳···的走着·········</p>

<p>我們從國外的消息中，知道在歐美各國，無論政　和社會，對於一　失業工人，都在竭盡智　去求救濟的方法，爲了這個問題的未能有滿意的解决，竟可使國家大員，惴惴於懐，政府内　整個的瓦解。這在我們中國的現在，祇能當一件笑話講講，而對於其他的失業者，那是更不必說了丨</p>
<p>應當先要感謝本刋的編者，他居然能着眼在我們失業人的痛苦上，願意留出一些寳貴的篇幅，作我們自　職業介紹的機會。我現在雖還沒有得到什麽好差使，但我先願爲我們的編者祝福！</p>
<p>自一二八日本人的大砲，把我僅有的財產轟去了，更把我的職業轟失，不，這也可以說是我自已丢掉的。那時我是在本埠江西路日商申亨洋行内任事，管理一切的賬務。自一二八的號砲響了之後，我覺得再和敵人爲友，再助敵人作經濟侵略的先鋒，是太無心肝了。我是十二分的慚愧，爲了要苟延幾條生命，我已在敵人的籬下，寄居了多年。這時我雖家室蕩然，經濟恐慌到了極點，但爲了爭國家一些些體面，爲民族爭一些些人格，我便毅然决然的向申亨洋行提出辭職，不願再和他們合作了。雖有許多朋友勸我找到了别的職司再辭去，但我那裏肯聽呢？况且那時還有很多熱心救國的團體，如上海市抗日救國會等願作爲我們一般因抗日而失業的人的後盾。他們要我去登記，以便介紹職業，我照辦了。那知一二八的砲聲沉寂了之後，所謂抗日救國會也無形中漸漸的消沉，我在家中天天迫切地盼望該會眞能實踐牠的諾言，給我一個救濟的福音；可是眞的五分鐘熱度已是過去了，誰還肩着抗日救國的旗幟再來呐喊一下呢？我的盼望永遠只是盼望丨至今坐在家裏，成爲一個渺茫的失業者，唉！一年多了！</p>
<p>我是中學畢業的程度，對於日文和英文，都有相當的根基。我於未入申亨之前，也曾在某洋行擔任管理賬務，所以對於處理新舊簿記，是比較的擅長。如有普通的事務，我也願意竭誠效勞。我在本刋上期待着任何方面的好消息。</p>

<p>主編業餘周刋的樸先生：</p>
<p>我是貴刋最近兩期的外埠讀者，因爲看見貴刋主要地位的文字，都署着一個「樸」字，所以纔喊出上面那個稱呼，槪不會錯吧？</p>
<p>我因爲對於貴刋敬愛到了一百二十分，同時爲地域所限不能直接訂閲，所以寫了封信給貴報總經理史量才先生，要求他將貴刋擴充到外埠來，不要侷促於一隅，使我們外埠申報讀者不能享受閲讀的利益（原信錄呈）。我們知道這是關於發行方面的事，不是先生權力所能及的，所以不向你嘵舌。</p>
<p>但對於編輯方面，我也有一個要求：</p>
<p>要求你盡量多多登載我們店員的文字，使我們身受的痛苦，有一個聲訴發洩的機會。平時店員對於經理老板們，有什麽困苦的隱衷，困爲怕歇生意，都不敢當面公然聲說，祇有背後怨恨。所以不得不希望貴刋能替我們店員做一個代言者，做一個我們店員利益保障人。　　雖然我知道因爲在現在社會制度之下的學府門檻很高，沒有雪白的大洋錢墊着脚跨不進去失學的我們，做出來的文字，當然是有點欠亨，登了出來，不免要坍貴刋的台。但有先生的一柄大斧，替我們削圓刨光，祇要保留牠的實質，出未嘗不可發表。</p>
<p>無論那個大小行業，不是經理一個人獨力所能做好，必賴他們的店員大家一德一心，通力合作，纔有興盛發展的希望。如果經理老板們對於店員的困苦不能了解，痛癢毫不相關，而店員口雖不言，心裏懐着怨恨，那麽這家商店的前途，就非常危險。要免除這種危險，並非施用壓迫所能有效。最好的方法是：店員們有什麽困苦，呌他們自已說出：有什麽建議，呌他們自已貢獻：而經理老板們借此也可以研究研究改善待遇的辦法。這不是比祇知閉着眼睛賺錢，不管人家的死活，結果弄到破產的地位，好多了嗎？</p>
<p>希望先生能接受我這個要求，希望貴刋發出萬丈光明，引導我們困苦的店員，從黑暗中解放出來：</p>
<h3 id="c273">韓德輝啓一、二、三、 <a href="#c273" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e273" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">273</a></h3>
<p>編者按：本刋向以店員學徒和工友的利益爲中心；所以除「業餘漫談」「專著」等欄，因爲求其能夠解救他們的智識飢荒起見，不得不特約專家撰述外，其他「問題討論」「工商界生活」「店員通信」等欄，素來多採用店員們的來稿。其中文字欠佳的當然難免；但是只須牠實質有價値，我們總是替他修改發表，從不敢送牠到字紙簏去。我們深信惟店員自已的描寫，才能中肯；亦惟這種中肯的描寫，才能打動店主們的心弦。所以我們最近在編餘裏，做了「字紙簏的生活素描」「恭喜發財，稿子滾進來」兩篇文字，就是要希望店員們多多的投稿。末了我們附帶的報告一下，就是本報總理史先生，决接受韓君的要求，準備在不久的將來將本刋擴充到外埠。同時我們也當鼓起精神，力求本刋的質量的充實。</p>

<h3 id="c274">却爾斯和珍妮的話别 <a href="#c274" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e274" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">274</a></h3>
<p>— 西容</p>
<p>却爾斯法雷和珍妮蓋諾，並且係好萊塢銀幕上最偉大的愛侶（TheGreatestSCreenLovg2</p>
<p>ers）、被全世界的影界推爲電影皇帝與皇后。但是現在銀幕上離婚了。一定會有人猜想到他們銀幕上的　蔓絲破裂了，私人交誼亦一定斷絕了。但這種猜想，係離開事實再遠沒有的。　　當却爾斯法雷决定了脫離狐狸公司、去同經理先生温尼希漢取消合同的那一天早晨希漢公事房的前面、圍攏了許多職員演員工作人等，他們都聽見了這不好的消息，但都以爲却爾斯會改變宗旨。他們以爲却爾斯所享受的地位與薪水，皆足使他留戀。但他决然傲然地竟把合同取消了。</p>
<p>却爾斯將一切取消合同的手續辦好。當然其中有許多握手告别安慰的話，却爾斯就跑到珍妮蓋諾的工作塲所去和妮告别。那時她正和一位新的男主角拍戲，她看見了却爾斯跑進去，就立卽停止了工作，跑到却爾斯的面前，拉了他的手說道，却利「你去了嗎？你獨自去了。從今以後我也祇好獨自進行了。」珍妮說話的時候，喉嚨中似有千言萬語不能罄吐之槪，並且滿眶包了熱淚，所謂黯然銷塊者，别而已矣！事後却爾斯對人說，當時他亦哽咽了許久，說不出話來。以這種惜别的情狀看來，他們兩人中間，决沒有什麽裂痕可尋的。</p>
<p>却爾斯爲什麽要暫時的脫離銀幕，固然可以說他已不願意和珍妮繼續合作。但他並不是不滿意於珍妮個人或公司中任何人，他是不滿意於他所得劇中的角色。因爲電影劇本中决沒有男女兩主角重的角色，可以這樣一年復一年地繼續合作下去的。所以他自從「七重天」之後，所有一切和珍妮蓋諾合演的電影，珍妮的名望固然是屹然不動，但却爾斯自已，却漸漸淪入了配角之例了。這是他所不能永久忍受的。</p>
<p>却爾斯對於珍妮的名望並無什麽嫉視之心。他曾說「我絕不希望珍妮犧牲她的名望來遷就我。她的名望係經年積月，辛辛勤勤地建築起來的。這一點上知道珍妮的莫若我。」所以他祇可　然引去了。</p>
<p>至於却爾斯和珍妮私人的交情怎樣，恐怕大家都知道他倆却各有家室。珍妮之篤愛其夫，亦正如却利之篤愛其妻。他們都是好萊塢人格最高尙的一輩人，所人做了銀幕上愛侶七年之久，並不曾影響到他們家室以内的伉儷之情。即爾斯說過這幾句話「我們兩人中。有手足之誼，兄妹之情，並且是經過多年患難的朋友。我們的奮鬥，愁慮，失望與希冀，係共同的。我們能互相諒解。我們各人的目的與慾望，却能互相體貼帮助。我們中間有深切完美的關係。照事實上講，銀幕上除掉我們二人之外，沒有再比我們要好的朋友了。其原因就在乎我們的「坦白無私」。</p>
<p>從這一點上我可以預告他們以後仍舊可以合作的，不過先要得到一個好劇本，使却爾斯恢復了志高（Chico)的本色，而珍妮仍舊做他的狄支妮（Dianne)。</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3 id="c275">評如此英雄凌鶴丨北京開映丨 <a href="#c275" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e275" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">275</a></h3>
<p>雖然生平不太歡喜喜劇，但是爲了中國居然出了「東方勞哈台」，而且我對於中國電影之發展又是如此之關心，所以關於這報紙上所宣傳的「中國電影界之大創舉」，當然非去領敎不可。</p>
<p>不過這一「大貢獻」所給與我的印象却不像他們所宣傳的那樣驚人。然而爲了對於中國電影懐着誠懇的希望，所以我也只得不客氣照直講了。</p>
<p>曾經看過蕭伯納的舞台劇本，也看過卓别麟的竹手杖和破皮鞋，在他們的作品中，雖然是嘻笑詼諧，但就像對喜劇純爲十足的門外漢的我，也覺得是有内心的，是値得咀嚼的，甚至於會在大聲歡笑中流出眼淚來。於是我不得不佩服他們，我不得不承認他們是人生的啓示者。但是就這一喜劇看來，雖然它的主題是笑駡「英雄」，暴露「英雄」的本色，然而可惜得很，並不曾使我們感受何種刺激。</p>
<p>劉繼羣和韓蘭根二君的表現能力似乎還不夠。但是導演莊國鈞先生對於的帮助却也極微，有好些地方我們都可看得到導演的技巧不熟練。其他配角都透生硬，於是一般看慣了外國的滑稽片的人們，便不能不有乏味之感了。不過比較的說，劉繼羣比韓蘭根强，這因爲韓君過於做戲的原故。</p>
<p>其他方面，光線太模糊，攝影亦不高明。然而字幕却很精采的。</p>
<p>然而最後的幾幕很好，那種以同一脚色來反串婦人與小孩，確是非常夠味的。當然，這是導演的聰明，但亦得編劇之力不少。</p>
<p>聽朋友說，這比較劉春山的「雞鴨夫妻」好得多多，不過我沒有看過「雞鴨夫妻」。况且這旣是「創舉」，而且也有這樣的成績，所以究竟敎我們相當滿足，所以人個人對於他們諸位的前途仍懐着絕大的希望。</p>
<p>最後，我因爲跟着許多觀衆笑了一陣回來，心裏還留有笑的味兒，於是當寫這批評的時候，在造句方面不免放蕩了一點，可是我有誠懇的用心，在高明的讀者諸君看來，當然是可以意會得到的。</p>

<p>關於却爾福雷和珍妮</p>
<p>好萊塢的謠言，眞是無奇不有。假使你是一個有名望的明星的話，那末關於你的謠言，也會特别來得多。却爾福雷就是其中的一　。</p>
<p>當却爾福雷攝完「蓬門千金」後，好萊塢的謠言就來了，說他和「蓬門千金」的女主角瓊斐納德戀愛，他倆常常出入的咖啡店裏，傳得有聲有色。但是却爾福雷只是付之一笑，不久，這謠言也就消失了。</p>
<p>一個失去，一個又來，好萊塢又謠傳了。當却爾福雷和珍妮蓋諾攝完「新婚第一年」和「情潮」後，這種謠言幾乎傳遍了好萊塢。說珍妮和却爾，他們的情火又在燃燒。珍妮將和她的丈夫離婚，却爾也預備和他的夫人解除婚約。於是便有許多的新聞記者到珍妮那裏去訪問，急得珍妮竟哭出來了，她說：「天哪！爲什麽許多人這樣地歡喜做謠言呢？你是曉得的，我的丈夫是很愛我的。」在却爾福雷方面，他覺得這次謠言是含有惡意的。後來有許多的電影刋物都替他倆　謠，這個謠言也就漸漸地消失了</p>

<p>— 雨</p>
<p>這是一張沈悶的，濕淋淋的片子，它是描寫着南海明麗之海島的黑黯面，以宗敎與慾情的鬭爭，用一個牧師，一個邊防的戌兵，和一個不知來歷的浪女，搆成這一汪汪的雨水丨丨苦悶與情慾的象徵。</p>
<p>雨，永遠是雨，沉悶的南海的熱雨，打在芭蕉葉上，一滴一滴地，好像悲哀的淚，好像貪婪的吐液，像蛇般地爬進人心，這就是全片給我們的暗示，然而演表却很沉悶，並不深深地動人，瓊克勞馥也是吃力不討好，而且一舉一動都是美國的野雞式，因爲太着力於地方階級色彩表現的緣故，遂致失却了世界性，使東方人看來感不到多大興趣。關於宗敎的描寫，也是局部的美國式，使人看了旣感不到天主敎式宏偉的莊嚴，也覺不到耶蘇敎式純樸的信仰。導演亦非第一流人才，單調重覆得令人厭倦，很好的一個題材是給弄壞了，從頭到尾祇彷彿在讀一篇吃力的寫實派小說。</p>
<p>另外，在客觀的條件上來評價，當然是一半因爲我們對於美國的土音不大聽得懂的緣故，不然，權且拿牠當作話劇來「聽」，也許會較爲滿意吧？然而，結果旣是這樣，那我們對於此片的同情，就祇好給雨水隔膜了。</p>

<p>First Seek Direct Understanding, Then Consider Economic Sanctions</p>
<p>Inviting the US and Russia to Participate Also Under Discussion</p>
<p>(Geneva) The nine-member drafting committee continued its discussion tonight to draft a clear and forceful proposal within the meaning of Article 15 of the Covenant, acceptable to both China and Japan, paying particular attention to preventing the recurrence of similar incidents in the future. The discussion has not yet concluded and will reconvene tomorrow (11th) to continue research. (Central News Agency dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The proposal by the nineteen-nation committee, drafted at the adjournment of the drafting committee tonight, has been drafted to six pages, and it is said that three more pages are planned. One page is expected to include an invitation to the United States and Russia to endorse the report and recommendations. Observers here believe that the proposed invitation to the United States and Russia indicates the committee's intention to continue its work, regardless of Japan's recent proposal. The current situation only allows for changes to the drafting committee's original plan if Japan acknowledges Chinese sovereignty over Manchuria. Although all parties are awaiting the Japanese response, few expect the Tokyo government to make such concessions. (National Telegram, 10th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Secretariat was quite busy this morning, printing and distributing the revised draft proposal to the committee members. The nine-member committee is scheduled to reconvene this afternoon at 3:30 PM. The meeting time seems likely to be extended, as there is currently no sign of a new method for handling the issue of organizing a negotiating committee. The members of the committee are deeply aware that they are not only making history, but also creating potential international law. Therefore, they want the solutions they agree upon to be applicable to any event, so that Article 15 and Article 16 of the League of Nations Covenant can be used to communicate worldwide. The situation when the committee adjourned yesterday without reaching a conclusion may be improved through informal exchanges of views among the committee members at dinner and elsewhere. Legal experts at the League of Nations are also diligently researching and drafting proposals. Therefore, the situation yesterday is expected to improve, and today's committee meeting may find a solid common ground, making progress faster. Currently, there is an indication that the work may be completed in today's long meeting. (Reuters dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Today, the Associated Press learned from a certain source that the drafting committee has agreed to the following outline of recommendations: ㈠ Quoting the original text of Article 10 of the Covenant, Article 1 of the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and the part of the Nine-Power Treaty regarding territorial integrity, declaring that these principles must be observed. ㈡ Quoting the original text of the League of Nations General Assembly resolution of March 11, deleting some points that are no longer applicable, and reaffirming that this resolution must be observed. ㈢ Quoting the full text of the ten principles in Chapter 9 of the Lytton Report, with quotation marks at the end of the tenth principle, "As suggested by Dr. Sun Yat-sen," and declaring that the League of Nations General Assembly adopted this principle as a condition for a satisfactory solution. ㈣ The proposal stipulates the establishment of a negotiating committee, but its organizational nature, personnel, and powers have not yet been determined. It also states that the most important responsibility of the negotiating committee is to negotiate the establishment of a governing body for Manchuria that does not conflict with Chinese sovereignty while guaranteeing the maintenance of order and protecting Japanese rights and interests. Another task of the negotiating committee will be to supervise the withdrawal of troops from Manchuria in accordance with the eighth principle of the Lytton Report. The final section advises League of Nations member states to refuse to recognize "Manchukuo" and not to cooperate with it, and states that the League of Nations resolution will be notified to non-member states, asking them to adopt the same attitude.</p>
<p>It is also heard that the drafting committee has practically decided on Friday that the negotiating committee should be appointed by the League of Nations Administrative Council and should be authorized to appoint representatives of non-member states, presumably referring to the United States and Soviet Russia. Also, the main work of the negotiating committee will be in the Far East, and its mission will take two or three years. Therefore, there is a tendency to advocate that it be organized by the diplomatic and consular representatives of the great powers in the Far East, so as to restrict the participation of countries with no interests in the Far East. If one of the two parties, China and Japan, does not want to send representatives to join the negotiating committee, it is heard that the drafting committee has decided that it can automatically declare that the country does not comply with the recommendations. If both parties are willing to join, the drafting committee has two views on how to determine the country responsible for any future breakdown in negotiations: One view is that the negotiating committee should be authorized to make its own decisions, supplementing the recommendations of the League of Nations General Assembly. Assuming that the date of troop withdrawal reaches a stalemate, the committee can make a final decision. If one party does not comply with this decision, it should be automatically considered as not complying with the recommendations of the League of Nations General Assembly.</p>
<p>The other view is that if the committee is granted such broad powers, it would be tantamount to granting it the power to make supplementary recommendations, and Japan could legally object, demanding that only the League of Nations General Assembly has the right to make recommendations. Moreover, when non-member states join the committee, Japan's objection is even more justified from a legal point of view, because Japan can argue that non-member states are drafting regulations that violate the League of Nations Covenant.</p>
<p>Some committee members have also proposed that if the negotiating committee reaches a stalemate, the disputed issues should be decided by the League of Nations General Assembly. However, some also believe that this procedure will inevitably lead to frequent requests for the League of Nations to resolve matters, making the League of Nations a laughingstock of the world. Today, the drafting committee continued drafting in the Secretary-General's office at 3:38 PM. (National Telegram, 11th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The nine-member drafting committee met for two hours tonight, but the discussion did not yield results and will reconvene tomorrow afternoon. At the same time, the Secretariat received instructions to begin compiling a new draft of the ninth item of the resolution, specifying the powers of the body that will negotiate with both parties and supervise the implementation of the recommendations. The discussion tonight was mostly of a legal nature, based on the articles of the League of Nations Covenant. The Swiss representative, Dr. Motta, spoke extensively, advocating compulsory arbitration. The Swedish representative strongly supported this proposal, but the outcome has not yet been determined. Tonight's meeting was the third fruitless meeting of the committee. After the meeting, one of the drafting committee members told reporters, "We are not trying to mediate between China and Japan, but to mediate among the nine-member committee." Legally, a difficulty has arisen, one of the obstacles being the legal issue of determining the implementation deadline of the recommendations. Several people spoke, saying that the League of Nations Covenant stipulates that the implementation deadline of the recommendations is three months. If either party fails to fulfill the agreement at the end of this deadline, it will be considered a breach of the Covenant. Some committee members also expressed extreme reliance on the Covenant on other legal points, tending towards more forceful action, but their theories did not achieve any consensus, and the meeting was adjourned until tomorrow. According to news from Tokyo, the Japanese government is currently considering the text of the League of Nations' recent letter. This news has raised some hope that the Japanese side still has the last word on the mediation issue. A certain expert familiar with League of Nations affairs, holding the most moderate view, expressed the opinion that if Japan rejects the League of Nations' recent contribution, then the aftermath will be as follows: After the recommendation on the organization law of the negotiating committee has been passed, the negotiating committee will try to seek direct understanding between the two parties within the scope of the recommendations. The powers of the negotiating committee have not yet been determined, but it must report the success or failure of its mediation efforts in about three months. If the report at that time is a failure of mediation, then the League of Nations will inevitably determine that one of the two parties has breached the recommendations, in other words, has breached the Covenant. Since the League of Nations Covenant has been breached, then Article 16 of the Covenant, which stipulates sanctions, must be adopted sooner or later. Now that the position of all countries is that the non-recognition of "Manchukuo" is an unavoidable matter, then those who oppose sanctions will only have to join other countries in implementing sanctions.

<p>Reply from Tokyo Will Only Be Sent Out on the Evening of the 13th</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Representative Matsuoka telegraphed the Japanese Foreign Ministry last night for instructions, saying that the result of the representatives' meeting held at 6 PM on the 10th was that the United Kingdom could no longer support Japan to the end, and mediation in the third item was considered hopeless. The League of Nations issued a document that was the same as a written accusation, and the representative department believed that it wanted to shift the blame to Japan, hoping that the Foreign Ministry would pay attention to this point when responding. Regarding the League of Nations' questions, it would be more beneficial to reply with ambiguous wording. Please consider carefully and telegraph quickly. (Hua Lian Telegraph, 11th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The representative department's draft reply, drafted by Minister Hiroshi Saito, only arrived at the Foreign Ministry this afternoon. It was immediately handed over to Foreign Minister Uchida and other heads of the department. A heads of department meeting will be held on the 12th to make a decision. After the decision is made, it will be approved by the temporary cabinet meeting on the 13th, and then submitted to the Emperor for approval, and then a reply will be sent to Representative Matsuoka on the same evening.

<p>(Tokyo) Regarding the Japanese government's reply to the nineteen-nation committee's questions, as a result of discussions by Political Vice-Minister Arida and Information Director Shiratori of the Foreign Ministry yesterday afternoon at 4 PM, they all believed that the independence and recognition of Manchuria was the only way to resolve the problem. This aim must be clarified, so the drafting of the reply must be approached with caution. (Electric Communication Agency Telegram, 11th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Japanese representatives held a meeting at 6 PM on the afternoon of the 10th, attended by Representatives Matsuoka, Nagaoka, and Sato, to carefully consider the Japanese government's reply to the nineteen-nation committee before submitting it. The notification of government approval will be awaited before a decision is made to submit it. The gist of the reply is based on the following items: ㈠ The so-called sovereignty of "Manchukuo" in the seventh item of Chapter 9 of the Lytton Report should only be decided after the establishment of a mediation committee. If a decision is made before this, it will block the path to mediation. ㈠ The reasons for the independence of "Manchukuo" have been repeatedly explained to the Council in the past three months, so there is no reason to ask questions again. ㈠ The principles of the Lytton Report should be considered as a whole, and not just independently.

<p>(Tokyo) Because the nineteen-nation special committee's attitude has hardened in handling the Sino-Japanese issue, the reconciliation negotiation under Article 15, Paragraph 3, which Japan had hoped for, is no longer possible. The committee is rushing to implement the shortest path to the recommendation measures in Paragraph 4. Therefore, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has also begun to prepare countermeasures to deal with the recommendation measures in Paragraph 4 as follows: ㈠ The Japanese government's reply to the nineteen-nation committee's note of the 9th will be issued around the 13th or 14th after the delegation's request for instructions arrives, clearly indicating the end of the reconciliation negotiation in Paragraph 3. ㈡ When the League of Nations General Assembly deliberates on the recommendation proposal in Paragraph 4, Japan will express its opposition based on the publicly stated statement in Article 15, Paragraph 5, and declare to China and foreign countries the legitimacy of Japan's attitude towards the current issue. At the same time, it will withdraw all of Japan's reservations regarding Article 15 and attend the General Assembly to cast a veto. ㈢ If the content of the recommendation proposal is unfavorable to Japan, it will immediately announce the delegation's return home. If the recommendation proposal actively denies "Manchukuo," it will formally notify the League of Nations of its withdrawal. ㈣ After Japan withdraws from the League of Nations, it must demand a change to the fundamental provisions of the Paris Peace Treaty, because the major powers such as Japan and the United States, which signed the treaty, are no longer in the League of Nations. Therefore, the League of Nations, created by the provisions of the treaty, illegally enjoys excessive international rights and obligations. Japan cannot tacitly acknowledge this fact unconditionally.

<h3 id="e5">A Frank Opinion from the British Press <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>If the League of Nations Continues to Indulge Japan, it Will Bring About its Own Destruction</p>
<p>The UK Upholds the Covenant and Does Not Believe Hong Kong Will Be Attacked</p>
<p>(London) The British Observer reported that there is now clear and unmistakable evidence that when the League of Nations General Assembly meets, it must resolutely declare its opposition to the recognition of "Manchukuo" in fact or in law, and ask the United States, Russia, and other non-member states to endorse this declaration. The United States will undoubtedly agree to this, because Secretary of State Stimson has already announced the doctrine of not recognizing any territory acquired by force. It goes without saying that League of Nations member states must refuse to lend money to "Manchukuo" and prohibit the supply of arms. The newspaper also mentioned the issue of sanctions against Japan, saying that the nineteen-nation special committee has just made a stronger resolution, and Japan has also proposed concessions, which shows that the saying that if the League of Nations had shown a firm attitude earlier, Japan would have already made concessions is not false. The New Statesman criticized the recent developments in the Sino-Japanese dispute, saying that the so-called mediation proposal by the Japanese is simply to ask the League of Nations to recognize its ownership of what it has already seized by force, and to allow it the freedom to seize it again. If Japan withdraws from the League of Nations, let it go. If Japan's demands are recognized, it would be tantamount to ringing the bell, announcing the death of the League of Nations. The newspaper also said that Japan is asking for whitewashing, but now it has obtained a stain. What will Japan do at this time? The League of Nations' condemnation of Japan and refusal to recognize "Manchukuo" does not mean a declaration of war. I think that even the most fanatical warlords in Japan will not want to bombard Hong Kong as retaliation simply because the United Kingdom supports the League of Nations' condemnation of Japan. Even if the United Kingdom supports the League of Nations' actions, leading to economic sanctions against Japan, we do not believe that Hong Kong is in danger of being attacked by the Japanese.

The South Pacific Development Company, the main base of Japanese capitalists, and the sugar manufacturing company organized by people from Okinawa Prefecture are panicking. Currently, in addition to the South Pacific Agency Director-General Matsuda Masayuki taking the lead in mediation, they are also preparing to use force to suppress them.

<p>Using the Reason of Reducing Military Spending</p>
<p>Actually Contains Significant Meaning</p>
<p>(Washington) The United States Navy has decided today to keep the Atlantic Fleet stationed in the Pacific, at least until July 1, next year. When Navy Commander Pratt issued this order, he added that this move was purely for the purpose of reducing military spending, because returning the fleet to the Atlantic would cost more than 400,000 yuan. At a time when the Navy's budget is being greatly reduced, it seems inappropriate to have this unnecessary expense. Today, except for maintaining the actual needs of the fleet's supply, no more money should be wasted. Moreover, the fleet's stay in the Pacific this winter will result in lower maintenance costs due to cheaper gasoline and warmer weather, as well as more economical supplies. Therefore, there is this new order for a second extension of departure. Since the release of this news, American journalists and representatives of several foreign newspapers immediately surrounded Secretary of State Stimson, asking if this new order had significant international implications. Mr. Stimson did not give a direct answer, only saying that the Navy Department issued this order on its own initiative, without consulting the State Department beforehand. He asked reporters to pay attention to Commander Praed's statement that this order was purely for the purpose of reducing military spending. The Atlantic Fleet sailed to the Pacific during the spring maneuvers and was scheduled to return after the exercises were completed. The first extension was ordered in October, and it was also for the reason of saving supplies that it was scheduled to return to the Atlantic this spring. Now it is the second extension.

If Japan has the ability, it will annex Manchuria. The League of Nations Secretariat has been kicked down by Japan and is powerless. Regarding the issue of disarmament, in the future, if ten-inch shells replace sixteen-inch ones to kill people, it will be a great fortune. (Special Telegram, 11th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) George Bernard Shaw and his wife arrived in China on the British Queen and arrived in Hong Kong at 7 AM this morning. The ship is scheduled to leave Hong Kong on Wednesday evening at 6 PM and will arrive in Shanghai on Friday, February 17, at 3 PM. (Reuters Telegram, 11th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) After George Bernard Shaw arrived here this morning, he received many telegrams from Shanghai, Beiping, and various Chinese organizations inviting him to give speeches at public banquets after arriving in port, one of which invited him to give a speech at a luncheon and reported on a tour of the Great Wall. Before leaving the UK, Shaw stated that 1. he would never sign his name in person, and 2. he would not sell his plays for film production. A Reuters reporter was among the first to meet Mr. Shaw. Mr. Shaw, tall and with white hair, told the Reuters reporter that he did not look like a Chinese person. Mr. Shaw also expressed surprise that no one from the Chinese press had visited him. Mr. Shaw asked with mild arrogance, "Are they so naive that they do not recognize me?" The reporter asked if he would fly to the Great Wall. Mr. Shaw said, "I have not considered anything more boring than this. What use is the Great Wall to China? Hadrian's Wall is more interesting." The reporter asked him to express his opinion on the current Sino-Japanese situation. Mr. Shaw replied that he did not know the truth, but then expressed a satirical opinion: "Japan is doing the right thing by not declaring war on China." Mr. Shaw then mentioned the League of Nations, saying, "The League of Nations is actually declining. Japan has made a bluff to the League of Nations. China should know that the diplomatic part of the League of Nations is an unimportant part of the organization. The International Labour Office is the only entity of the League of Nations at present. The League of Nations Secretariat has been beaten down by Japan, and the League of Nations has no way to deal with it." Mr. Shaw then mentioned the death of Galsworthy, saying, "Galsworthy was my friend. It is strange that he died before me. I am also going soon." Mr. Shaw then praised H.G. Wells, saying, "He is almost the only person of the new era I know. As for me, I belong to the 19th and 21st centuries." Although Mr. Shaw said that whether he would go to the United States on this trip was still uncertain, he denied the rumor that he would never go to the United States. He said, "This kind of rumor is as absurd as saying that the United States will come to see me." Mr. Shaw stated that he would not give speeches or broadcast speeches anywhere. He said that although "all wars will stop for the Queen," he still hoped to tour Beiping and did not want the war in North China to prevent this trip. Mr. Shaw then touched on the issue of Soviet Russia, saying that all civilized countries should now study the Russian constitution. There are many points in the Russian constitution that other countries have ignored. After Mr. Shaw answered everyone's questions, he asked the guests about Hong Kong and China. Mr. Shaw said that he found the Chinese government very interesting. Mr. Shaw also compared the Chinese warlord system to the peerage of the feudal era in England. Those who visited Mr. Shaw later this morning were all politely rejected. (Reuters Telegram, 11th)</p>

<h3 id="e11">The Dispute Between "Yes" and "No" <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>Obscure</p>
<p>The League of Nations and the Sino-Japanese dispute. The resolution of the Northeast being forcibly occupied. Since the September 18th Incident, it has never considered effective methods of restraint. We certainly acknowledge that the League of Nations is merely a moral sanctioning body, absolutely without the strength to restrain the military aggression of Japanese imperialism. Moreover, one or two major powers have intentions of siding with Japan, tacitly approving all the atrocities of the Japanese army in the Northeast. There is a special background. At the same time, our country is directly victimized. Apart from appealing to the League of Nations to uphold "justice" as a moral sanction, there is virtually no more forceful expression. Because of this, the League of Nations procrastinates and even a moral sanction is begrudged and not given. The reason why they repeatedly dispute and cannot decide what is right and wrong is simply because the "Far Eastern balance of power" has already been broken, and the distribution of interests among the powerful countries is not yet even. That Japan has already done as it pleased, developing its "continental policy" to its peak. Even if our country loudly proclaims resistance, it will not harm the slightest bit the Japanese militaristic aggression. If this continues, the international balance in the Far East will become increasingly fragmented, and the Chinese market will become increasingly deteriorated. How can this be pleasing to Britain and France? And the United States will probably find it even more difficult to sit idly by.</p>
<p>In order to maintain its face and to maintain the "balance of power in the Far East" among the powers, the League of Nations cannot but express something. Therefore, the League of Nations' nineteen-nation committee deliberated back and forth and then issued a letter of inquiry to Japan. Its main point was to inquire:</p>
<p>'Does Japan "or" does it "not" recognize its acknowledged independent state of "Manchuria" as a method of resolving (the Manchurian problem)?'</p>
<p>And asked Japan to give a clear "yes" or "no" answer. If it considers it yes, then the nineteen-nation committee will prepare to accept Japan's reservation and proceed with mediation under Article 15, Paragraph 3 of the Covenant. If it is "no," then it will prepare a report in accordance with Article 15, Paragraph 4 with appropriate recommendations. In the League of Nations, this move has indeed exhausted its ability to be gentle and peaceful. But Japan believes that if it answers "yes," it would be tantamount to slapping itself in the face, admitting to abolishing the puppet "Manchukuo" it had created single-handedly, and submitting to the joint management of the powers. It would have to forcibly divide some of the vested interests in "Manchuria" with Britain and France. Even the United States, which wants equal opportunities, would certainly have to share a piece of the pie. If it should answer "no," then the proceedings under Article 15, Paragraph 4, would be unavoidable. Japan would still be forced to submit to "recommendations" (joint management) and sacrifice its exclusive control over the Northeast. Therefore, whether it is "yes" or "no," Japan is in an unfavorable position. Thus, the military department was indignant, the government clamorous, and groups gathered to discuss countermeasures. They stubbornly adhered to their traditional aggressive claims, stubbornly recognizing the puppet "Manchukuo" as an accomplished fact. The powers must recognize it; otherwise, they would "not hesitate to withdraw from the League of Nations."</p>
<p>Japanese militarists and spokespersons for the military department, such as the "Diplomatic Times," have long expressed contemptuous views of the League of Nations, advocating an Asian Monroe Doctrine. Its domination of the Far East and forcible occupation of Manchuria are indeed undeniable facts. Therefore, our country, with its lost territory and sovereignty, cannot recover it with empty talk of right and wrong without "iron and blood." Diplomatic negotiations are merely a formality, merely a superficial activity to socialize with the international community. Japan's invasion of North China, seizing Jehol, and disturbing Tianjin and Beijing, whether it withdraws from the League of Nations or not, will adopt the same method. Let us cite the statement of the army authorities on February 9, openly advocating that invading Jehol is a matter "within Manchuria (the puppet state)." Zhang Xueliang should not send troops; sending troops would be considered provocation. But the Japanese army's dispatch to Jehol is a "necessary means to maintain public order." What is even more outrageous is that it calls its invasion "the exercise of sovereignty by Manchuria (the puppet state)." The conclusion once again attempts to cover up and deceive, saying that this kind of invasion is "not provoking war against China," and that "in the future, there is no intention to provoke war." This kind of argument both disregards our country's territorial sovereignty and what regard does it have for the League of Nations' empty talk of justice?</p>
<p>Then, whether Japan withdraws from the League of Nations or not, its relationship with the League of Nations only means the loss of Japan's membership fees. Other than that, there is no loss whatsoever. Or perhaps it can stimulate them to find some "justice" in the international community. In the opinion of this writer, if Japan does withdraw from the League of Nations, although we will have difficulty finding opportunities to argue with Japanese diplomatic representatives in the future, diplomatically: First, Japan will fall into international isolation in the future. Second, the League of Nations cannot restrain Japan's atrocities, but it strengthens its violent monopolization, or it may prompt Britain to reflect and no longer listen to Japan one-sidedly. Third, break the joint management situation. Fourth, form a new international balance of power. Fifth, strengthen Japan's own difficulties. Its foreign trade, although it may not be affected immediately, but the lives of the general public will inevitably be difficult to maintain. Sixth, since Japan has withdrawn from the League of Nations, Japan can ignore any criticism from the League of Nations. Although our country has lost a kind of diplomatic application, in the future, we will engage in hand-to-hand combat with Japan and fight the final actual battle with strength, no longer relying on others, but striving to save ourselves.</p>
<p>In short, Japan's aggression against China, whether it withdraws from the League of Nations or not, or whether the League of Nations exists or not, the fact that it cannot seek a solution through diplomatic negotiations is obvious. The lessons of one year and five months should be fully alert. Hereafter, we might as well put aside "justice" and see what the outcome of "wrestling" will be.</p>

<p>Many New Recruits Lack Experience</p>
<p>Sent to Manchuria for Special Training</p>
<p>Reuters Tokyo Dispatch, The Japanese newspapers have been reporting the dispatch of large numbers of troops to Manchuria for several days. Some of the troops have undergone some training in the barracks, but most are young new recruits who only enlisted on January 20. Normally, new recruits being transferred to Manchuria must complete their initial training in their designated military district before being transferred abroad. However, this is not the case now. Therefore, the Manchurian 　隊 [corps] is not as strong in manpower as the Japanese army. Among the new recruits being transferred to Manchuria, there are not many experienced officers going with them, because experienced officers must stay in Japan to train training teams and assign them to new recruit teams. In the Manchurian divisions, the number of people per division is only about 5,000 or 5,500, while the divisions stationed in Japan usually have about 8,500 people per division. This year's decision to transfer new recruits to Manchuria for local training, without initial training, will increase the number of troops in Manchuria from 40,000 to 55,000, or even more. These new recruits will naturally not be of much use in the first few months, but the training corps that go with them can serve as a rear support team in the event of war. The Japanese authorities are dispatching new recruits to Manchuria for local training, in addition to increasing the military strength in Manchuria, and it is said that there are two other purposes. One is to gradually acclimate new recruits to the climate of Manchuria, so that they will not be affected by the climate during wartime, and the other is to train new recruits in field warfare, because the work required in Manchuria is similar in nature to police work, which is completely different from what is usually trained in Japan. At the beginning of the Manchurian Incident, the combat power of the troops dispatched by Japan was not as effective as the six railway protection regiments, because the railway protection troops had been stationed in Manchuria for a long time and had received special training. The Japanese authorities believe that order in Manchuria may not be restored for several years, so they have decided that new recruits serving in Manchuria will henceforth be directly sent to Manchuria so that they can receive special training from the beginning, as the railway protection troops have received.</p>

<p>Chamber of Commerce Decides to Strike to Protest</p>
<p>Havas Paris Dispatch, The House of Representatives began a major debate on the government's financial bill at 9:35 am. Danting, the leader of the right-wing party, raised a preliminary question, saying that the estimated budget deficit varies for each previous Minister of Finance, and the current government's proposal will definitely not be able to make up for it in full. Mr. Danting advocated for more austerity, and reduced the burden on taxpayers, and proposed issuing national lotteries, in order to preserve the vested rights of veterans. The government and the Finance Committee expressed their opposition to the above preliminary question, and it was rejected by a show of hands. Congressman Malan, a right-wing politician, continued to speak, reiterating Danting's criticism, advocating for tighter national spending, and effectively streamlining finances. As for reducing national defense spending, it is a criminal act at the moment. Congressman Digro, another right-wing politician, wanted to postpone the discussion of the bill, and the government and the Finance Committee came out in opposition and it was rejected by a show of hands. The general rapporteur of the Finance Committee, Ruzier, went on stage to explain the financial bill, saying that it could reduce expenditures by 217.3 million francs. Combined with the austerity bills passed previously, it could save a total of 574 million francs. As for the consolidation of tax revenue, it is estimated that it could increase revenue by 15,770,000 francs. Combined with the previously passed numbers, the total number of new revenues is 203.33 million francs. If the results of the exchange of public bonds are included, it can reduce the deficit by more than one million million francs. Ruzier also said that, according to the figures estimated by experts, it can be determined that the budget deficit will not exceed one hundred and five million million francs, and we can even hope that it will not reach this number. Ruzier further stated that the government and the Finance Committee expressed opposition to a complete balance between income and expenditure, because the exact amount of the deficit could not be determined. In conclusion, Ruzier declared that the argument against excessive spending was not fair, and that the public, in excessive pessimism, should have something to prevent it.</p>
<p>Reuters Paris Dispatch, The Chamber of Commerce and Industry, dissatisfied with the government's tax proposals, held a meeting of the chairmen of various organizations today and decided that on February 16, from noon to 7:00 pm, all stores nationwide would be closed to express their protest. However, employees involved in the 7 hours of the strike will be paid as usual. According to the new government's financial proposals, although only clerical staff will bear a very light tax, and veterans will even be 　免 [exempted], it is still subject to strong opposition. The Civil Servants' Union has unanimously rejected it, stating that it will never make the slightest sacrifice.</p>

<p>Schoolchildren Encounter Disaster on Way Home, Unable to Escape, One Tram Car Completely Destroyed and Missing</p>
<p>National News Agency, Saarbrücken, Germany, 10th A major change occurred in the town of Neunkirchen in the Saar region today, which is an unprecedented industrial disaster in Germany. The gas plant and the nearby Benzinol refinery suddenly exploded, causing the houses to be shaken and collapse one after another. At the same time, red flames 　溢 [overflowed], and the nearby streets were turned to ashes. It was 6:00 pm, and the workers in the factory had not dispersed. Male and female workers from other factories had finished work and were returning home one after another. Schoolchildren had also finished their classes and were returning home. They suddenly encountered the disaster on the way and were unable to avoid it. Therefore, in addition to those who were crushed to death by collapsing houses, there were also many people who were burned to death by stray fires on the way. As of 10:00 pm tonight, there have been 200 bodies found. More than a thousand people were injured, of whom 200 were seriously injured and feared dead. The number of casualties in the remaining disaster area is still impossible to calculate at this time because excavation has not been completed, but the number of deaths and injuries will definitely not stop there. The gas plant in this city is the largest in the Saar region and is located in the center of Neunkirchen. The town has a population of 45,000. The gas capacity of the plant is 120,000 cubic meters. The large gas holder is 80 meters high and 45 meters in diameter. The Benzinol refinery exploded first, and the gas plant was affected and exploded as well. Nearby towns heard the tremors, and the people in the full sea area felt tremors again after being shaken, suspecting that it was the recurrence of the earthquake. In Neunkirchen, 50 houses near the factory site were turned to ashes. The fire brigade rushed to rescue, but 　能遏止其波　他廠 [was only able to contain the disaster from spreading to other factories]. However, the disaster was extremely serious. The hospital was full of injured people, and temporary first aid hospitals were immediately established in countless numbers. The most peculiar thing is that one tram car happened to be driving in front of the factory when the disaster occurred and was instantly destroyed, and its whereabouts are unknown. The roofs of the factory buildings flew half a mile away, and part of the railroad was also destroyed, forcing transportation to be temporarily suspended.</p>

<p>Reuter's, Cologne, 10th: Lauenkothen in the Saar region, a major mining town, experienced a sudden explosion in its largest gas storage facility tonight. The heavy iron lid was blown a mile and a half away. One hundred people are dead, and at least one thousand are injured, with concerns that one hundred of the injured may also die. The sound of the explosion was heard as far away as Mannheim, and the flames were visible from thirty miles away. The oil storage area of the factory also exploded, immediately catching fire. Fifty houses in nearby streets were completely burned to the ground. Corpses were flying, falling on the streets, and some dismembered limbs were stuck to the walls, a truly unbearable sight. Many houses in neighboring villages were also damaged, demonstrating the immense power of the explosion. The entire fire brigade rushed to the scene, vigorously fighting the fire to prevent it from spreading. Doctors and nurses also arrived at the scene, bravely transporting the injured to hospitals, and some were performing temporary surgeries on the spot. It is expected that there are still corpses buried in the rubble. After the explosion, telephone and telegraph communications were disrupted due to the shock, so the news of the disaster was not widely known until rescue teams arrived from neighboring villages. The police authorities are now planning to order residents in all parts of the town to evacuate, as the gas leak is extremely dangerous. Trains cannot enter the station because the tracks are covered with debris. The factory, which had the most modern equipment in the entire Saar region, has been destroyed in an instant. Its gas coke ovens and electric furnaces have all been blown up.</p>
<p>Reuter's, Cologne, 11th: The corpses and the dying being pulled from the rubble have incomplete limbs. Residents in the danger zone are still very frightened. Women and children are abandoning their homes and seeking refuge in schools and other public buildings. Police officers from across the region are rushing to the scene of the disaster in heavy trucks.</p>
<h3 id="e72">Death Toll Gradually Rises to Over Three Hundred <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>National News, Saarbrücken, 11th: The explosion at the gas plant in Neukothen is now burning overnight, as people search for those buried in the rubble. The death toll has gradually increased. According to the latest news, it has exceeded three hundred people. In addition, over three hundred people were on the verge of death in hospitals yesterday. All hospitals are full, so temporary wooden sheds have been built to accommodate the injured. The gas plant is now surrounded by police. The devastation of the entire town is heartbreaking. Authorities fear further explosions, so they have ordered nearby residents to evacuate as quickly as possible. According to eyewitnesses, the current state of the town is as if it has been bombarded for several hours. The cause of the disaster is still unknown. When the explosion occurred, it shook for about a hundred miles. Even seismographs in distant observatories showed signs of tremors. The amount of loss is still impossible to estimate.</p>
<h3 id="e73">Excavation Work Still in Progress <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>Reuter's, Cologne, 11th: It is now believed that last night's disaster in the town of Lauenkothen was caused by the explosion of a gasoline tank, which ignited the gas. Sixty corpses have now been pulled from the rubble, and it has been confirmed that houses collapsed like stacks of cardboard, resulting in the death of entire families. The number of seriously injured has increased to two hundred and fifty, and the number of slightly injured is about several hundred. Local hospitals are full, so many injured people have been transported to hospitals in neighboring villages for treatment. A coke oven and several houses are still burning, but there is no danger of further explosions. Excavation work is still in progress. It is expected that it will take several weeks to clear the rubble and debris from the streets and repair the electrical and telephone lines. After this disaster, hundreds of households have no work to do, putting the residents of the town in dire straits.</p>
<h3 id="e74">Roosevelt's Foreign Policy <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>To Maintain the Stimson Doctrine in the Far East; To Clear up the Situation Left by the Great War in Europe</p>
<p>(Havas News Agency, Washington, December 12th) The "Foreign Affairs Review" in the United States, its relationship with the Democratic Party, and its position in American diplomacy are well known to us. In January next year, the magazine will publish an article by Colonel House discussing America's future diplomacy. House was a close friend of former President Wilson and was deeply trusted. His words are naturally interesting.</p>
<p>House's article elucidates "The Spirit of the United States Under the New Presidency of Roosevelt." According to his view, after the new Democratic government takes power in March this year, its goal will be to settle the situation left by the European War, to restore the world's trust, to remove obstacles to international commerce, and to enable the leaders of various countries to focus their energy on achieving new and constructive plans.</p>
<h3 id="e75">Reasons for the Failure of the Republican Party's Policies <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>Previous Republican governments also wanted to achieve the same goals, but they failed to consider economic problems in a practical way, and ultimately achieved nothing. Moreover, they were limited by state boundaries and narrow perspectives, which caused these problems to be delayed until today, making it doubly difficult for the authorities. It is said that the policies of Presidents Harding, Coolidge, and Hoover were all influenced by the Republican Party's selfishness. The party harbored unrelenting resentment toward former President Wilson, so that even after the end of the European War, wartime thinking still existed. The economic recovery failed, the situation was unstable, and all kinds of chaos existed in the world. It is not an exaggeration to say that the blame for all of this lies with the three Republican presidents.</p>
<h3 id="e76">Roosevelt Will Change Course <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>Since the Republican Party has failed in this regard, the new President Roosevelt should take a different approach to deal with the current problems. Based on his research of Roosevelt's previous statements, House said that he firmly believes that once Roosevelt takes office, he will treat both his own people and foreign governments with the same fairness and the same determination. House also said that the new president was a member of President Wilson's cabinet and was deeply influenced by Wilson.</p>
<p>House reviewed one by one the problems that Roosevelt should solve after taking office, such as tariffs, war debts, security, disarmament, and the Far East problem.</p>
<h3 id="e77">First, the Tariff Problem <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>According to his view, the tariff problem has completely changed since the European War. The United States was originally a debtor nation, but it has now become a creditor nation. In the past, American commercial settlements were often favorable, but today, because the United States has become a wealthy country, and European countries, as creditors of the United States, have now become poor, it is only logical that American commercial settlements cannot but change accordingly. The best solution now is to increase imports as much as possible, but reducing export trade is the worst policy. All of this depends on the tariff policy. President Hoover's policy was to raise tariffs, but between 1922 and 1929, the number of American manufactured goods exported increased greatly. House said that America's customers borrowed dollars in the United States and bought American products locally, but these customers could not sell goods to the United States in equal quantities because they suffered from unsound financial development. This development increased bank lending through low-interest policies and allowed the United States to absorb a huge amount of foreign securities. We do not allow foreign countries to earn American dollars to repay their debts to the United States, but instead give American dollars to foreign countries to pay interest.</p>
<p>House believes that this is a mistake in American policy and advocates the following theory: The real tariff problem is to enable foreign countries to earn a substantial amount of American dollars to repay their debts and to enable foreign countries to consume American goods without having to borrow money. According to the loans that various countries have borrowed from the American people, the amount that should be repaid each year is about 1,200,000,000 American dollars. We should enable various countries to no longer borrow new debts and to be able to repay part of them with goods and cash separately. We should take into account the loans that the United States has made, and we should also protect American foreign commerce to prevent it from being unfairly squeezed. This is what should be taken into account when formulating tariff policies. The current tariff rates should be reduced appropriately, and some should be greatly reduced. I say this not to advocate a free trade system, nor to advocate using tariff revenue to meet budgetary needs. I hope that tariffs will not hinder commercial competition and can recover the loans that have been made. The tariff system implemented by the United States after the war has another drawback, which is that it has aroused retaliatory measures from various countries. The creditor countries are looking around blankly, with no solutions. The United States should show them a compass so that they can find a way out. The new President Roosevelt intends to convene an international conference to discuss the issue of tariff reduction. This can become an important event in history. The improvement of the tariff system may be discussed by this conference or by the World Economic Conference. In short, all countries in the world have the same need for tariff reduction and economic settlement.</p>
<h3 id="e78">Second, the War Debt Problem <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the war debt problem, House said that he believes that after the new government takes office, it should strive to make war debts no longer an international problem. This matter should be resolved through negotiations between the United States and the debtor countries. I think that in the spring of next year, the debtor countries should invite the United States separately to hold meetings to resolve the war debt problem in an organized manner, without having to adopt various means of refusing payment or temporarily suspending the payment of due installments. Roosevelt has declared his support for this kind of meeting and said that tariffs must be lowered so that foreign goods can be easily imported, and then foreign countries can repay their debts. House repeatedly stated that the uncertainty of transfer is one of the reasons why the world's economic situation has been slow to return to normal. He also said that when Roosevelt spoke on February 2, 1922, he hoped that the war debt problem could be resolved through rapid compromise. Roosevelt had a thorough understanding of this problem, so he made this statement, which was not an empty discussion.</p>
<p>House went on to say that the Allied countries in the European War had a sincere desire at the Lausanne Conference to temporarily forget the war debt problem and made significant progress on the German compensation problem to seek a final solution. The reason for this was that the people of various countries were aware that the compensation problem, covering Europe, would eventually lead to disaster, so it was better to resolve it with pain. The American people should also use the same reason and the same method to work hard to resolve the war debt problem so that it will no longer be a point of international dispute.</p>
<h3 id="e79">Third, the Disarmament Problem <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>Regarding this problem, House said that if we sincerely advocate disarmament, we should take action so that various countries feel that their land and property are safe and secure, and then disarmament will follow. There is no other way.</p>
<p>House then stated the plan of the Democratic Party's national convention, which advocates mutual consultation when treaties are threatened in order to maintain the Kellogg-Briand Pact in an effective way. House then stated that regarding the disarmament problem, political problems should precede technical problems so that various countries can engage in disarmament within a reasonable degree of safety. The more security that countries feel, the more their military power can be reduced to uselessness, and there is no one who would not be happy to reduce it.</p>
<p>For example, countries can jointly formulate plans to prevent aggression and mutually guarantee that no country can break this plan without prior warning or negotiation. Only with such guarantees can land disarmament be realized. However, if a country wants to retain its freedom to judge and act freely when an international group openly discusses whether a certain international action is consistent with its interests or whether it is beneficial to the maintenance of peace, or is unwilling to take any action with the attitude of an autonomous and responsible person, it cannot be equated with the same day.</p>
<h3 id="e80">Fourth, the Far East Problem <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>House said that in the Far East and Manchuria problem, the United States has two interests: one is to maintain the dignity of treaties, and the other is to maintain the traditional policy of open door. The principle announced by Secretary of State Stimson last summer was to have both parties restore the original situation through an automatic act or to resolve disputes through direct negotiations between the two parties under the guidance of the League of Nations. If the second method can be implemented, then the true purpose of the United States can be achieved, which is to maintain the Kellogg-Briand Pact.</p>
<p>Finally, House said that I dare to say that under the Roosevelt administration, American foreign policy will definitely tend to be generous and humane. We will not refuse the responsibilities that we should bear, but if the United States treats other countries fairly, we hope that other countries will also treat us fairly. We try to use fairness as the standard of action, but we sincerely hope that other countries will also treat all matters related to the happiness and security of the American people with the same principle.</p>
<h3 id="e81">Disarmament Conference Reaches Critical Juncture: German Representative Sharply Refutes Paul-Boncour <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>National News, Berlin, 10th: The General Committee of the Disarmament Conference continued to meet today. The German representative Nadolny spoke, refuting in detail the remarks made yesterday by French Foreign Minister Paul-Boncour regarding the right to equality. Nadolny said that the agreement of December 11 last year was the foundation for Germany's re-participation in the Disarmament Conference, so Germany could not tolerate any deviation from the agreement as long as it was in the conference. Nadolny also issued a solemn warning, saying that false and inappropriate disarmament conventions would not help the overall situation. Nadolny's remarks were endorsed by the German newspapers, which said that the debate in the main committee in recent days had clearly indicated that the Disarmament Conference had now reached a crossroads, and its success or failure would be determined in the next few days.</p>

<p>Lindsay Will Take British Plan Back to the US</p>
<p>Reuter's, London, 10th: The Cabinet Committee held its ninth meeting today to discuss war debts. The work of the committee is now extremely intense so that Ambassador Lindsay can go to the United States next Tuesday. Lindsay was also present at today's meeting. A special meeting will be convened on Sunday, at which a general discussion of the war debt problem will be held. After repeated discussions, Lindsay may be able to take back to the United States the British Cabinet's views on the war debt problem, the selection of the British delegation, and the organization. After Lindsay arrives in Washington, he will notify President-elect Roosevelt of the British Cabinet's views, and then Roosevelt will inform Britain and invite a delegation to the US to negotiate war debt issues. Before Lindsay meets with Roosevelt, the British government may not make any further statements. Lindsay may return to the US alone, without any advisors. Before the British delegation arrives in the US, Lindsay will be fully responsible for consulting with the US government.</p>

<p>Reuter's, Gaza, Blanca, 10th: French famous aviators Bossoutrot and Rossi took off from Paris at 7:45 yesterday morning, planning to make a long-distance non-stop flight to the capital of Argentina in South America, breaking the record recently obtained by British aviators Gayford and Nicholetts. The attempt has failed. After flying over the Strait of Gibraltar at 5:20 yesterday afternoon, the two encountered headwinds blowing from Barcelona and landed here last night. This trip was intended to win a prize of 800,000 French francs from the French Ministry of Defense.</p>
<p>National News, Casablanca (Morocco), 10th: French aviators Bossoutrot and Rossi set off from Istres, France this morning, planning to go to the capital of Argentina in South America and seize the world long-distance non-stop flight record from British aviators Gayford and Nicholetts. Unfortunately, halfway through the flight, the engine overheated, and they landed here at 8:30 tonight. It is now believed that this failure was due to the rushed preparations.</p>

<p>Zhou Zhaoxiang, a member of the Beijing Municipal Public Antiquities Association, was arrested a few days ago by the Ping Municipal Public Security Bureau pursuant to an order from the Executive Yuan, accusing him of colluding with a puppet state, and detained in the preferential treatment room of the Third Section of the Public Security Bureau. Subsequently, Xiong Xiling, Zhou Zuomin, Leng Jiaji, and others petitioned the Public Security Bureau for his release, but to no avail. Mayor Zhou Dawen said, "Mr. Zhou's arrest was pursuant to an order from the Executive Yuan, and the release procedure must also have an order from the Executive Yuan. I (the Mayor) have telegraphed the Executive Yuan for instructions today (the 7th), since the antiquities have been moved south, Mr. Zhou seems to be able to be released.

<p>"So-called Organized Nation," says Tokyo Jiji Shinpo: Recently, fraud cases have been discovered one after another with the sacred court as a background. Although the prosecuting authorities have increased the crackdown, in addition to the cases of the violent gangs, vicious lawyers, and prison officers in the Tokyo District Court Prison Department, now there are unscrupulous people using the names of high-ranking judicial officials to organize the Imperial Jury Association, soliciting 6,000 members and defrauding 20,000 to tens of thousands of yuan. Currently, in addition to arresting the fraudsters Araki and Fujita, the mastermind, and others, many people, including the chairman of the association's board of directors, the accounting director, and the secretary, have all fled. It was found that the association first used more than 30 diplomats, using the names of former Minister of Justice Hara Yoshimichi, Chief Prosecutor Hayashi Raizanro, Judge Miyagi Nagata of the Tokyo District Court, Judge Tanamachi Takejiro, President Izumi Jishinkuma of the Supreme Court, and Director of the Penitentiary Bureau Shiono Suehiko, to lure members, stipulating that supporting members would pay 10 yuan per year, and regular members would be issued membership cards and legal consultant cards after paying membership fees. Supporting members were issued letters of thanks from the former Minister of Justice, and were taught knowledge of the jury law. As a result, more than 1,000 supporting members and 50 regular members were lured to join, and the membership fees obtained reached 20,000 to tens of thousands of yuan.</p>

<p>After the Jiangsu Provincial Government decided in a previous committee meeting to merge the county bureaus and establish sections to handle matters, except for the Education and Finance Bureaus, which have already been regulated, the remaining construction　 bureaus are also in the planning stages. However, external speculation about the merger of the Public Security Bureaus is largely inaccurate. As the matter concerns public security throughout the province, this reporter specially visited Zhao　　, the Director of the Department of Civil Affairs, to inquire about the truth. According to Zhao, the standards for this matter are based on three factors: the guns, funds, and needs of each county. It is currently under review and will be officially announced within a month. As for the police in the county　 townships and towns, their retention or abolition will be determined by the needs of the local people and the volume of travelers. The reorganization of waterborne public security has been considered for a long time, but it is difficult to implement due to funding difficulties. It is expected that a concrete solution can be found after the central government promulgates the regulations for the Yangtze River Water Police Bureau. The issue of training female police officers will be pursued in the future within the realm of possibility.</p>

<p>The income from compensation allows credit to be maintained, and business can flourish. Life insurance can also be used in joint ventures to prepare for shareholders unexpectedly withdrawing capital. Moreover, the substantial investments of life insurance companies benefit the development of industry and commerce in no small way. Life insurance companies are, in fact, centralized financial institutions upon which various industries rely for development. Taking the United States as an example, life insurance companies purchase various securities worth approximately 200 billion yuan, accounting for the majority of the nation's corporate capital. Their great contribution to the business world is also a well-documented fact.</p>
<h3 id="e99">㈤ Promoting Social Peace <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>Life insurance has mutual benefits for individuals, families, education, and industry and commerce, so it goes without saying that it contributes to the tranquility of society. People are the elements of families, and society is organized from families. The more people who purchase life insurance, the more people will live and work in peace and contentment. When the lives of the people are stable, the security of society will naturally be strengthened. Moreover, it promotes industry and commerce, accommodates talent, reduces unemployment, and employers insuring employees eliminates labor disputes, all of which are top strategies for increasing security.</p>

<p>Life insurance companies handle business with scientific methods as the guiding principle. When purchasing life insurance, a physical examination is required. Changes in physiology and symptoms of disease are often not noticed on a daily basis, but after an examination, one suddenly becomes aware. Therefore, people diligently pursue hygiene and correct weaknesses. If the entire nation competes to promote this, a healthy nation can be expected. Moreover, life insurance companies all engage in social work, using the remaining capacity of their business to promote public health and participate in various health movements, especially striving to research methods for preventing and eradicating disease.</p>
<h3 id="e101">Rapid Development of the Life Insurance Industry in Japan <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Jones, the Vice President of New York Life Insurance Company, recently gave a speech at the Life Insurance Association Conference in New York, praising the development of the life insurance industry in Japan.</p>
<p>He said: "Fifty years ago, Japan had no life insurance, nor did it know what life insurance was. However, currently Japan ranks fourth in the world in terms of life insurance authority. The United States federal government is a giant in the world life insurance industry, accounting for 70% of the world's total business, followed by the United States, and then Canada.</p>
<p>"Japan is making extraordinary efforts in the development of the insurance industry. Its development period can be divided into three stages: 1880 was the beginning of the Japanese life insurance industry, after 1900 was the development period, and after 1916 was the most prosperous period.</p>
<p>"Many aspiring foreign students who come to the United States to study life insurance are almost all sent by Japan. They often visit and inspect the internal organization and business strategies of various companies for application when they return home.</p>
<p>"Insurance, including life and property insurance, is a required subject in the business departments of every university in Japan, and almost all senior commercial high schools have a course on the principles of insurance.</p>
<p>Why should every wealthy person in Japan buy life insurance?</p>
<p>There are several reasons why a wealthy person should buy life insurance:</p>
<p>㈠ To obtain readily available funds at the lowest cost, so that his property and business will not suffer losses.</p>
<p>㈡ To ensure that his descendants receive a fixed inheritance after his death.</p>
<p>㈢ To maintain his original social status after investment failures.</p>
<p>㈣ To ensure the safety of his property after death.</p>
<p>㈤ To provide security for other investment failures to avoid property loss.</p>
<p>㈥ To provide security for property loss in case of other business failures.</p>
<p>㈦ To ensure a fixed income in case of future business failures.</p>
<p>㈧ To avoid property loss.</p>
<p>㈨ To provide security for estate taxes.</p>
<p>㈩ The insured assets can be enjoyed and used after insurance, not just after twenty years.</p>
<p>㈩㈠ To obtain good and stable investments.</p>
<p>㈩㈡ To eliminate speculative ideas.</p>
<p>㈩㈢ To obtain a fixed income when one is old and unable to work.</p>
<p>㈩㈣ To provide economic security for the family.</p>
<p>"The staff of various insurance companies in Japan have been trained in the United States, and all business methods are based on the standards of our association. Therefore, their knowledge and experience have been improved, and their business can be developed.</p>
<p>"Currently, the world's attention to life insurance is focused on the United States, but our association's recent observations suggest that this situation may shift to other countries. The United States has realized this and is willing to use its successful experience in the insurance industry to help the development of the life insurance industry in other countries when the opportunity arises. At the same time, let us gradually reduce the record of world insurance coverage maintained by the United States, so that all countries can achieve balanced development in life insurance.</p>
<p>"The necessary conditions for developing the insurance industry in various countries in the world are to promote social evolution, improve living standards, and maintain world peace, and then smooth development can be achieved."</p>
<h3 id="e102">American President Discovers Double Case <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>The protagonist was originally an insurance manager. The president's joke made business boom.</p>
<p>Recently, an interesting double case occurred in the United States, which not only caused a sensation in society but also remains a beautiful story in the life insurance industry to this day. When Roosevelt was elected last year, newspapers everywhere competed to publish Luo's portrait so that those who admired him could catch a glimpse of his style. Unexpectedly, a man named Kennard, an insurance manager in Rochester, New York, looked exactly like Roosevelt, so much so that the local people, after discovering this, saw it as an honor to catch a glimpse of this fake president, and some even mistakenly thought it was Roosevelt himself. Therefore, Kennard was often surrounded by many people when he went out so they could catch a glimpse of his style, and the number of people who came to Kennard's residence every day to seek an audience was even more numerous. Later, Roosevelt learned of the news and personally went to Rochester to meet Kennard. Upon meeting, he was also astonished and blurted out, "This is my brother." After Kennard's reputation was enhanced a hundredfold, local people who purchased life insurance have since considered it an honor to be handled by this "president's brother." Not only did Kennard's business flourish, but the company also gained many new policyholders as a result, which shows the American people's admiration for Roosevelt.</p>
<h3 id="e103">Losing Sharpness Brings Unexpected Fortune <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>In Macanama, London, there was a person who specialized in long howls as his profession. To protect his sharp pronunciation, he insured his voice with an insurance company. It was stipulated at the time that if his voice was accidentally damaged, the company would pay him US$50 per week in compensation. Once, his sharp throat sound was accidentally damaged and he could not make long howling sounds. The company not only fulfilled the contract but also increased the compensation to US$150 per week and paid it until his throat sound recovered. At that time, he was very happy to hear this news, because although his throat sound was temporarily lost and he could not engage in his profession, the insurance compensation he could get every week was unexpectedly US$5 more than his previous salary. This is truly a blessing in disguise.</p>

<p>Alas, foreign enemies are encroaching, and the national situation is becoming increasingly critical. Ever since September 18th, the powerful invaders have been rampaging, constantly expanding their continental policy, hoping to destroy our country's ambitions. This time, when they invaded Yuguan, our An Dexin unit, guarding the territory, resolutely led their entire battalion of brave soldiers and swore to fight to the death, ultimately leading to the defeat of the many by the few, perishing with the city. Alas, the great righteousness is awe-inspiring and shines like the sun and moon. The heroic deeds are a lesson for future generations. Everyone must die, but there are deaths heavier than Mount Tai or lighter than a feather. Things do not necessarily involve calculating gains and losses, and success or failure should not be discussed in terms of heroes. The martyr An did not act carelessly when facing the crisis, shedding his blood on the majestic pass, achieving benevolence and taking righteousness, and being loyal to the Party and the country. His name will be remembered forever. Although defeated, he is still glorious, enough to influence future generations. This is how we know that the spirit of the martyr An and all the patriotic brave soldiers is immortal. However, the reason why we deeply mourn the martyr An is not only because of his death for justice, but only Yuguan has not yet been restored, leaving the martyr An with empty regrets. Therefore, we offer this elegy, saying: Alas, General, a man of great hope for saving the times, sitting and guarding the border, the chickens and dogs are silent. You uniquely exercised your authority, and the barbarians were conquered, and the court and the countryside admired you together. Alas, the Japanese bandits invaded our Yuguan, and with a cry, the three armies were ordered to fight. We were hoping that the invaders would be taught a lesson, but unexpectedly, the red-hot heart was suddenly shot through. Three thousand sons and brothers died with you. Such magnificence and grandeur are unmatched in ancient times. It is recorded in history books that even though the person is dead, the name remains. The spirit is immortal, shining with the sun and the moon. But the star of the general has suddenly fallen, who will fight for the nation and bring glory? The national crisis is severe, who will resist for China? With tears, we present this elegy, hoping that you will not abandon it and come and enjoy it.</p>
<h3 id="e109">Meeting Declaration <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>Alas, the Northeast has been lost and has not yet been recovered. The hated Ezo barbarians have insatiable greed, constantly encroaching and oppressing us. After occupying our Liaodong, they invaded Rehe. After our righteous army did their best to resist, they could not develop and changed their strategy to attack our Yuguan. Yuguan is a natural barrier, the throat of Pingjin. If Yuguan is lost, Rehe and Mongolia will be in danger. Fortunately, our Lord An Dexin led 500 brave soldiers to resist them outside the national gate, slightly blunting the enemy's edge. Ultimately, due to weak troops and limited strength, the ammunition was exhausted and aid was cut off, and he died in battle on the battlefield. His loyal and courageous spirit fills the universe and is enough to shame those who possess heavy troops and treat their territory like worn-out shoes. When Lord An waved his spear to resist the enemy, he forgot himself for loyalty and forgot his family for the country, using his horse armor to wrap his body and taking the battlefield as his pleasure. Such loyal and righteous people are rare throughout history. In the distant past, he can be compared with Yan Pingyuan, Changshan, and Qi Jiguang, and in recent times, he can be mentioned in the same breath as Jiang Guangnai and Cai Tingkai. Lord An was a believer in the pure religion of Islam, with extraordinary ambitions and the ability to build a bright and upright career, enjoying the great name of loyalty and martyrdom for thousands of years. Although Yuguan has fallen, the merits and achievements of Lord An shine in the annals of history. This is why we mourn Lord An and commemorate Lord An today.</p>
<h3 id="e110">Biography of Martyr An <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>The martyr's family belonged to Baoding, Hebei, and was a follower of the Islamic religion. He had an 80-year-old mother, a brother, a wife, two daughters, and a son. His family worked as farmers. The martyr had great ambitions since childhood, saddened by the decline of China, the rapid encroachment of enemies, and the deep disaster. Therefore, he engaged in military service, vowing to repay the country with iron and blood. He entered the Northeast Jiangwu Hall Infantry Department and graduated in the summer of the 16th year of the Republic. He served as a major battalion commander of the 23rd Division of the 29th Army and the adjutant of this division. In the 18th year of the Republic, it was reorganized into the 9th Independent Brigade of Infantry. The martyr served as the lieutenant colonel battalion commander of the 1st Battalion of the 626th Regiment of the brigade. During the September 18th and January 28th incidents, the martyr witnessed the rampant behavior of the eastern neighbor and the fragmentation of the mountains and rivers. He ground his teeth and trained his subordinates, brave soldiers, vowing to avenge this hatred. When the Yuguan war broke out, the martyr was secretly pleased and said to his soldiers, "It is time for us to repay the country!" He led 500 brave soldiers to guard the South City Gate, and there was a heroic saying: "If you want to break Yuguan, you must pass through the corpse of Dexin!" His tone was generous and passionate, and those who heard it were indignant. On January 1st, the Japanese army used its giant cannons and the cover of tanks to attack fiercely. Martyr An fought against a force of 2,000 with 500 soldiers, using rifles and machine guns against their giant cannons and powerful weapons, disregarding his own life. The sharpness of the weapons was not comparable, and the number of soldiers was vastly different. When reinforcements did not arrive and the ammunition was exhausted, he still shouted with his bare hands and fought the enemy in close combat, causing 500 brave soldiers to regard death as home. In the end, he died in battle in the wilderness of the north. Alas, the death of the martyr is not only the glory of the country but also the glory of the world's Muslims.</p>
<h3 id="e111">Brief History of Martyrdom <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>After the Japanese army threw grenades and bombed the temporary residence of the Japanese military police team at the Yuguan Railway Station on the night of January 1, they sent troops to harass and shell. Therefore, our army not only sent people to negotiate with the Japanese side but also stepped up vigilance. The next day (January 2), as soon as it dawned, more than 200 armed Japanese soldiers gathered under the South City Gate and climbed the city with ladders. The first battalion of An Dexin guarded the South Gate. The Japanese army climbed the city and fired guns and cannons at the city. The troops stationed in our city did not receive orders at the time, so they were not able to return fire and could only throw bricks and tiles. Later, because the Japanese army's artillery fire became more intense, our defending soldiers could no longer bear it and began to fire machine guns, sweeping down the city. For a time, the Japanese army suffered heavy casualties and began to retreat. Subsequently, the Japanese army repeatedly attacked the city several times and were repelled. On the morning of the 3rd, after the Japanese army bombed the South Gate with heavy artillery, our first battalion piled up sacks at the damaged area to provide cover and continued to resist calmly. After a while, the Japanese army sent a tank leading more than 300 infantrymen to attack the city. After the enemy's tanks crashed through our army's sack cover, they attacked into the city. Our soldiers dodged the tanks and desperately charged at their infantry. At this time, although the Japanese soldiers were once again charged out of the city by our first battalion, the strength of our South Gate was mostly killed or injured. Battalion Commander An Dexin then requested that the third battalion, which was guarding the East Gate, dispatch a part of its troops to arrive at the South Gate for assistance. Before the reinforcements arrived, the Japanese army advanced on a large scale. At that time, because the Japanese army's artillery fire was exceptionally fierce, our soldiers suffered too many casualties, and Battalion Commander An was also seriously injured. He retreated from the West Water Gate to outside the city and died for his country. Alas, the loyal and courageous martyr An and all the officers and soldiers of the entire battalion ultimately shed their last drop of blood at the West Gate.</p>

<p>Chairman Lin's elegiac couplet says, "Protect our borders and mourn this national tragedy." Duan Qirui's elegiac plaque says, "Commendable Loyalty and Courage." Wu Tiecheng's elegiac couplet says, "A small force defends the border, and when the enemy comes, they kill them, vowing to fight to the end, and their blood stains the dust. In the face of adversity, their loneliness and loyalty are to be admired, but public justice and the League of Nations are looked upon in vain. Their strength is not enough, but their righteousness is unwavering. The land is full of heroes, and their heroic spirit will inspire Yuguan for thousands of years." Gu Mengyu's elegiac couplet says, "The majestic mountains and rivers are殘残 on this day, and the vast sea of clouds is falling stars." Zeng Zhongming's elegiac couplet says, "The whole country mourns, lamenting the five hundred men of Tian Heng. Looking to the border city, alas, the first pass in the world." Xu Shiying's elegiac couplet says, "Hating the enemy together, the majestic pass has been fought a hundred times, and the spirit is immortal, and the blood will last forever." Dai Ji's elegiac couplet says, "Five hundred Tian Heng died at the same time, guarding the country, with no such extraordinary fierceness. The Liaohai mountains are covered with clouds, and hearing the wind, they will raise their arms and sing sadly." Li Liejun's elegiac couplet says, "Hot blood splattered on Yuguan, crying for the 100,000 households of Chunshen, and the loyal soul returns to the Bohai Sea, with the righteousness of the five hundred men of Tian Heng." Wang Zhengting's elegiac couplet says, "Determined to eliminate enemies, knowing that the hearts of the people will never die, sacrificing oneself for the country, and fighting for the glory of the nation."</p>

<p>Talks about moving the artifacts of the Forbidden City to Kaifeng and Luoyang. The plan for organizing Sichuan's government has been drafted. He came here to attend the graduation ceremony of the Sino-French School and returned to Beijing that night. According to the Central News Agency, Chu Minyi, Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan, arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning to attend the graduation ceremony of the Sino-French Industrial High School. He took the overnight train back to Beijing last night. The reporter from the Central News Agency visited Chu at the Sino-French School yesterday and asked about the location of the artifacts of the Forbidden City and the plan for organizing Sichuan's government. Chu graciously granted an interview and replied as follows:</p>
<p>Artifacts Decided to Move to Kaifeng and Luoyang According to Chu, the central government has decided to move the artifacts of the Forbidden City to Kaifeng and Luoyang. The Executive Yuan, following the central government's order, has telegraphed the Kaifeng authorities to select an appropriate location for the artifacts to be transported to Kaifeng for safekeeping. The 2,118 boxes of artifacts that have arrived in Pukou will be temporarily stopped at Pukou Station. Once the location for safekeeping has been selected, they will be moved for preservation.</p>
<p>Plan for Organizing Sichuan's Government Regarding the recent disputes in Sichuan Province, the 330th meeting of the Central Political Conference decided to entrust the Executive Yuan with the task of detailing the implementation measures based on the National Government's order of the 17th year of the Republic and drafting a plan. The Executive Yuan, based on this resolution of the Central Political Conference, has begun to draft the plan for organizing Sichuan's government. Once it is completed, it will be submitted to the Central Political Conference for approval and then handed over to Zhang Yuejun to take to Sichuan to implement in conjunction with the Sichuan authorities. As for the establishment of Xikang Province, a decision will be made after Zhang Yuejun inspects Sichuan. The Liu Case Was Handed Over to the Disciplinary Committee The National Government has handed over the case of the Jiangsu Provincial Government shooting Liu Yusheng to the National Government's Political Official Disciplinary Committee for review. In addition to forwarding the Jiangsu Provincial Government's reply to the Supervisory Yuan, the Executive Yuan has no opinion on this case. The Jiangsu Provincial Government's reply stated that Liu Yusheng was a communist and that there was a record of his case in the 16th year of the Republic. This time, the execution was approved by the Martial Law Headquarters and the Military Commission and was unrelated to the Jiangsu Provincial Government. It is heard that the Jiangsu Provincial Government will submit a second reply to defend itself. As for whether political prisoners from the 16th year of the Republic are excluded from the amnesty, I have not checked the amnesty provisions in detail and cannot answer.</p>
<p>Wang Jingwei's Return Date Regarding the report that President Wang has departed from Lyon to return to the country, I have not received any telegram from President Wang. President Song had previously telegraphed President Wang to inquire about his return date and urge him to return to the country as soon as possible, but no reply has been received so far.</p>
<h3 id="e114">The National Goods Association Telegraphs for the Rescue of Ding Chao <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>Ding is an official of our country and should be returned according to the precedent of the Japanese general [name] being free, not harmed. The National Goods Factories United Association sent a telegram to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, saying that it was reported that General Ding Chao, who previously led volunteer troops to resist Japan, was captured in Jiamusi, escorted to Harbin by Japanese officers, and will be sent to Changchun for trial by the puppet state and sentenced to death. Upon reading this, we are extremely shocked. General Ding is an official of our country who was captured for resisting Japan. According to international law, he should be returned, not harmed. This is evidenced by the fact that when our country captured the Japanese general [name] during the Shanghai war last year, we did not punish him according to the law, but treated him as a prisoner of war. Therefore, we specially telegraph to your ministry, on the one hand, to argue with the Japanese side based on reason, and on the other hand, to telegraph our delegation to report the details of this case to the League of Nations in order to rescue him.</p>
<h3 id="e115">Li Liejun Discusses the Draft Constitution <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>It is essential to fully express the spirit of democratic politics. Jiang invites him to Gan and may go there if necessary. The Central News Agency reports that Mr. Li Liejun, a member of the Central Committee, is from Jiangxi and is very familiar with the situation in his hometown. It was previously reported from Nanchang that Chairman Jiang had telegraphed to invite Mr. Li to Gan to discuss the aftermath of the bandit area in Jiangxi. Yesterday, the reporter specially visited Mr. Li to inquire whether this statement was true. According to Mr. Li, the message came from private sources in Nanchang that Mr. Jiang did indeed hope that he would go to Gan to discuss the aftermath of the bandit area in Jiangxi. Since the matter concerns his hometown, he may go to Gan if necessary. The reporter then asked Mr. Li for his opinion on the current situation and the draft constitution. Mr. Li resolutely said, "Treat compatriots equally, govern the world with impartiality and sincerity, saving the country is always here, and building the country is always here." As for his opinions on the draft constitution, it is difficult to list them all, but it is most important to fully express the spirit of democratic politics. Then the reporter asked Mr. Li whether the Central Executive Committee had telegraphed to urge him to go to Beijing to participate in national affairs, and whether he would accept the invitation to go to Beijing. Mr. Li then showed the reporter his reply to the Central Executive Committee, which read: "To the Nanjing Central Executive Committee, I have received and read your telegram. For many years, I have been unable to reside in assisting because of the difficulty in realizing democratic politics and because of my frequent illnesses. I am very sorry. In the past, Sun Tzu had his kneecaps removed but was still able to ride in an ox cart to plan for Qi, defeat Wei, and rescue Han. I am indeed physically weak, but with the Japanese being so tyrannical, how dare I not try my best to resist the enemy together? Once the major plan is decided, I will naturally go to Beijing. Victory lies in harmony, and many hands make light work. I think that the military personnel of our party residing in various places have already sent telegrams to invite them. Respectfully replying, Li Liejun."</p>
<h3 id="e116">Japanese Consul General Visited Secretary-General Yu Yesterday <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>Explaining that Japanese residents building factories must obtain licenses in accordance with regulations in the future. The Central News Agency reports that on the seventh of this month, Chinese troops passed through Shanghai, and the Japanese side considered it a violation of the ceasefire agreement signed on May 5 last year. The Japanese Consul General in Shanghai, [name], went to the Municipal Government on the morning of the 9th to protest to Secretary-General Yu. Secretary-General Yu refuted him based on reason, and the Japanese Consul General had no choice but to retreat. Yesterday morning, the local Japanese newspaper also reported on this matter, saying that they would send a letter to the Joint Committee to convene a meeting to discuss it in detail. Yesterday morning, the reporter went to the U.S. Consulate to inquire, and according to the person in charge, they had not received any notification. Then, they went to the Municipal Government to inquire, and it happened that Japanese Consul General [name] and Secretary [name] also visited Secretary-General Yu at 11:25 a.m. and left after talking for half an hour. Then, according to Yu, the Japanese Consul General came to visit today not to continue to raise the issue of our troops passing through Shanghai on the 7th, but to reply to our previous protest. It turns out that there are many Japanese-owned yarn factories in Shanghai, and they never followed the regulations to apply for licenses from the Municipal Public Works Bureau when building factories in the Municipal Government's jurisdiction. Our side had protested. The Japanese Consul General came here specifically to explain and said that they would handle it in accordance with the regulations in the future.</p>
<h3 id="e117">The Increase in Water Prices is Alarming <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>The Taxpayers' Association Sends a Letter to the Public Works Bureau to Pay Attention</p>
<p>From 2 yuan to more than 20 yuan. The Shanghai Concession Chinese Taxpayers' Association sent a letter to the Director-General of the Public Works Bureau yesterday, saying, "According to [name]'s letter, our company built four Hongshunfang houses in Taiyuanli, Caishi Street, Zhuangyuan Lane, Hongkou. According to the monthly rent received, a total of 49 yuan, the water bill paid, from the time of renting until October last year, was at least 2 yuan or more per month, and at most 3 yuan and 40 cents. Unexpectedly, the water company's bill in November last year suddenly increased to more than 14 yuan. Because it did not match the previous amount, we could not pay it. The bill in December was even more drastic, reaching more than 20 yuan. Our monthly rent is only 49 yuan, but the water bill suddenly increased from more than 2 yuan to more than 20 yuan, a tenfold increase, which is beyond reason. Moreover, in addition to paying the water bill, we also need to pay land tax and repair costs. Even if the land price and construction cost are not counted, we can barely make ends meet. Therefore, we appeal to your association to uphold justice and negotiate with the company based on reason to reduce the price immediately in order to alleviate the plight of businesses." It has been reported to the association that the case is already under discussion by your bureau for relief. According to the previous situation, a corresponding letter is sent to request that you investigate and handle the case together.</p>

<h3 id="e120">[Name] Discusses Promoting National Goods <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>He deeply hopes that factories will not reduce the enthusiasm of those who love to use national goods by producing goods that are not durable. The Central News Agency reports that [name] said to the reporter yesterday that promoting national goods is an urgent task today. However, national goods factories often rush to produce goods and neglect the research on quality, which leads to the fact that although Chinese people have the enthusiasm to purchase national goods, they sometimes feel disgusted because they are not durable. Therefore, he hopes that national goods factories will pay attention to this, and the government should also conduct strict inspections to prevent the foundation of national goods from being destroyed in one day. [Name] also said that the product exhibitions of various countries often place domestic products and imported products side by side in one place, with labels added to allow Chinese people to compare them for easy purchase. The intention is very good, and our national goods exhibition hall can also follow suit.</p>
<h3 id="e121">The Ministry Approves the Reduction of National Coal Freight <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>The National Coal Relief Association Discusses in Detail. It is heard that Chinese-owned coal mines in the country are all facing a decline because of high freight costs, which increase costs and make it difficult to compete with foreign coal. Fortunately, the local National Coal Relief Committee is trying to save the situation and has submitted a request to the relevant ministries to reduce freight costs in order to alleviate the difficulties of the mines.</p>
<p>The association recently received a telegram from the Ministry of Industry approving the Ministry of Railways' consultation, which roughly stated that coal exports on the Jiaoji Railway have been given a 20% rebate, and domestic sales have been given a 10% rebate. Coal exports from northern Shanxi have also been given a special price of 3.7 yuan per ton. Recently, it also ordered the Pinghan Railway to transport coal from north to south to Hankou, and coal exports are specially allowed to be charged at 80% of the current freight rate of the new 32nd clause, starting from February 1st for a period of six months. Mining merchants should quickly reorganize themselves and reduce costs to compete. It is also heard that after receiving the above telegram, the association has forwarded it to various coal mines for their information. As for the measures to reorganize and reduce costs, the association proposed a detailed discussion when it convened the National Coal Relief Conference in October last year, and it is in the process of planning.</p>

<p>The junk was affected and has filed a claim for compensation. The bodies of the victims are still missing. After the Taikoo Company's Ningbo ship and the Zhongwei Company's Taiping ship collided on the Huangpu River in Dongjiadu, the two companies appointed ship surveyors and decided to inspect them separately at 10:00 a.m. today. The affected junk has filed a claim for compensation from the company. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Agreement on Inspection. After the two ships collided, the two companies originally scheduled to send ship surveyors to inspect them yesterday. However, due to lack of time, the two companies changed the appointment by telephone yesterday to inspect them again at 10:00 a.m. today. The Taikoo Company has appointed Deputy Chief Engineer [name], and the Zhongwei Company has appointed Ship Surveyor [name] to inspect them separately. The Taikoo ship is berthed at the China Wharf, and the Ningbo ship is berthed at the Jiangnan Shipyard.</p>
<p>Request for Compensation. The junk affected by the collision filed a letter to the Zhongwei Company yesterday, requesting the two companies to compensate for the losses: 1. Five [name] junks, the losses are estimated at 500 yuan for [name], 360 yuan for [name], 650 yuan for [name], 680 yuan for [name], and 550 yuan for [name]. 2. Two [name] junks, the losses are estimated at 2,450 yuan for [name] and 3,580 yuan for [name]. Now the Zhongwei Company believes that the responsibility for the collision lies with the Ningbo ship and has decided to forward the requests of the junks to the Taikoo Company. The remaining ships have not yet filed claims for compensation.</p>
<p>No News of Recovering Bodies. After the [name] barge that departed from the [name] Wharf and passed through [name] was sunk in the collision, more than 30 crew members and passengers drowned. Except for [name], who was rescued by the water patrol team and sent to Shanghai Hospital for treatment, and [name], who was recovered by the Lifesaving Bureau and whose family claimed the body, the remaining 20 or so people are feared to have been eaten by fish. As of last night, there was still no news of recovery. It is heard that the workers of the [name] brick and tile company in [name] usually traveled by this ship, so many people were killed this time. However, because the bodies of the victims have not been recovered, the exact number is still unknown.</p>

<h3 id="e124">The Southern Goods Industry Announces a Ban on Entering the Market <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>To oppose the newly revised method of the United Market, the City Chamber of Commerce and other organizations have sent personnel to thoroughly investigate the matter. The Shanghai Sugar Industry, North-South Grocery Industry United Market decided to uniformly use the new weighing instruments starting from the 26th of the month.</p>
<p>Due to the newly revised method of payment of the sugar industry and the northern goods industry, disputes have arisen in the north-south goods industry. The Southern Goods Industry Association convened a general meeting of members at Chongyi Hall on Ninghe Road at 2:00 p.m. on the 9th and decided that before the matter is resolved, they would not be allowed to enter the market or purchase goods from the upper companies, creating a serious situation. The City Chamber of Commerce and other organizations have sent personnel to thoroughly investigate the matter. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>New Methods for Sugar and Northern Goods. The new methods formulated by the Northern Goods Industry Association are as follows: Scale Discount 1. 88% discount for selling Southern standards; 2. 85% discount for selling Northern standards; 3. Other items such as red and black [items] that are usually weighed [amount] will continue to be calculated at 98% discount; 4. All current 98% discounts for Southern standards will be cancelled; 5. All items such as [items] sold using Southern standards will be discounted 88% including the skin. Payment Terms: (A) The following terms are set for sales to various domestic customer groups: 1. For Southern standards, payment is due one month from the date of shipment, with payment due every ten days at the end of the month, using ten-day drafts; 2. For Northern standards, payment is due on the 20th of the month for goods shipped from the 1st to the 10th, and payment is due at the end of the month for goods shipped from the 11th to the 20th, all using ten-day drafts; the rest can be deduced by analogy. (B) The following terms are set for sales to export groups: 1. Payment for the Guangzhou, Shantou, and Xiamen groups is due seven days from the date of shipment, using ten-day drafts; 2. For the Fuzhou, Xinghua, Quanzhou, Wenzhou, Ningbo, and Yangtze groups, payment is due on the 20th of the month for goods shipped from the 1st to the 10th, and payment is due at the end of the month for goods shipped from the 11th to the 20th, all using ten-day drafts; the rest can be deduced by analogy. The above regulations are scheduled to be implemented from January 26, 1933. As for the [industry] Association, the methods are roughly the same as those of the Northern Goods Association, so they are omitted.</p>
<p>Southern Goods Insist on Opposition. The Southern Goods Industry Association believes that the [industry] and the Northern Goods Industry have taken advantage of the implementation of the city weighing to formulate new methods, shorten the payment period, and require that all payments that previously used checks must be changed to drafts. They have also formulated other discounts. Compared with the old system, it is calculated that each load will be short by one and a half catties. They believe that this is very unfair. Therefore, the Southern Goods Industry Association and the customer groups have jointly opposed it, demanding fair transactions. They should obey the use of city weighing, but the discounts should be based on the original standards. The Northern Goods Industry refused to withdraw the new methods, resulting in a major dispute.</p>
<p>Meeting Resolves Important Matters. After the Southern Goods Industry Association held a meeting and made a decision, it immediately issued an emergency notice to its members, which read: "Notice: The sugar industry and the northern goods industry have formulated new discounts and changed to drafts for the trial use of city weighing. This association has repeatedly convened emergency meetings and resolved that the city weighing should be based on 96% of the original standard, and all other [methods] should be denied. Now, in order to actively implement the methods, a general meeting of members was convened yesterday and resolved: 1. Before this association and the other party have resolved the matter, it is forbidden to enter the market or privately buy goods from the upper companies. Anyone who violates the resolution will have their deposit confiscated in full and their membership revoked. 2. In order to prepare for the aftermath, each member is allowed to pay a deposit of 100 yuan, which will be kept by the custodial committee and returned in full afterwards. The custodial committee will be [names] of the American Concession, the British Concession, and [names] of the French Concession, and [names] of Zhabei. Members are requested to pay the custodial committee near them within two days. The office of this association is temporarily located in the New Music Men's Business Association on Nanyang Bridge, French Concession. If you have any business, please go there. This is a record and announcement, and it is hoped that you will follow it. This matter concerns the fundamental interests of this industry. It is hoped that members will resolutely stand to the end and not act against it. This is most important. This notice is hereby issued."</p>
<p>Yesterday's Market Situation. Since the Southern Goods Industry resolved to strike, the marine products, sugar, and northern goods industries in the United Market on Xiaodongmen Zhonghua Road operated as usual yesterday, but there were no transactions. The Southern Goods Industry Association specially appointed [list of names] to be responsible for handling this matter and set up an office on Nanyang Bridge.</p>
<p>Sending Personnel to Investigate the Truth. After receiving the report, the City Chamber of Commerce immediately sent staff member Yuan Hongjun to the relevant industry associations at 10:00 a.m. yesterday to investigate the reasons for the strike of the Southern Goods Industry. After receiving the report, the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs also sent staff members to thoroughly investigate the matter in order to find a way to mediate and avoid expanding the dispute.</p>
<h3 id="e125">The Public Security Bureau Urges the Installation of House Numbers <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Public Security Bureau issued a notice to all district offices under its jurisdiction to compile and install household registration house numbers, starting from January 15, originally limited to one month. However, due to the end of the year and the beginning of the year, residents were slightly delayed due to accumulated habits. It is heard that the Municipal Public Security Bureau recently instructed all district offices to uniformly complete the compilation and installation by February 15 and will not extend the deadline any further. It is said that the district offices are rushing to complete the work as soon as possible.</p>
<h3 id="e126">The Aviation Association Moves to a New Address Today <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>The Aviation Association has received more and more letters of support. The new address of the Aviation Association is No. 99, Great Western Road, and it has now been completely decorated. It is scheduled to move in to work this morning. According to the person in charge of the association, the staff members of the association were unable to work in separate departments due to the small size of the previous address, which caused all affairs to proceed slowly. After moving to the new address, they will actively handle matters, and the donation management committee, which has not yet been resolved, will also start to be organized in the near future. Also, yesterday the association received a donation from [name] of the [name] Yarn and Flower Company.</p>
<p>Advocating the Purchase of Children's Aircraft. The Chinese Children's Welfare Association's April 4th Children's Day is approaching in a blink of an eye. It plans to take this opportunity to carry out a national salvation movement and raise funds to purchase aircraft for military use. It sent a letter to the Aviation Association a few days ago, asking for its assistance. The original letter is recorded as follows: "In order to promote children's welfare, our association has reported to the National Government to designate April 4th of each year as Children's Day (abbreviated as April 4th), which has been communicated to the whole country by the Ministry of Education to be followed uniformly. The first event was held last year, and major cities and towns across the country, such as Shanghai, Nanjing, Beiping, Suzhou, Hangzhou, Nanhui, Zhenjiang, Jiangyin, Xuzhou, Jiaxing, Kaifeng, Nanchang, Fuzhou, Wuzhou, and other provinces, a total of 27 major cities, had enthusiastic activities. According to reports from various places, the number of participants was approximately 11,000 adults and more than 105,000 children. It can be seen that the Chinese people are interested in Children's Day and believe that children's welfare has the ability to transform culture and inspire children's patriotism and spirit of unity. This year's April 4th Children's Day is approaching in a blink of an eye. Our colleagues, in view of the endless invasion of the violent Japanese and the many strategies for saving the country, convened a meeting of all staff members of the association last month to prepare for the National Children's Day. It is expected that the number of cities and participants this year will be more than last year. After the September 18th and January 28th incidents, the patriotism of children across the country is surging. Our colleagues plan to take this opportunity to follow your association, with the grand strategy of aviation to save the country, to advocate children's donations and purchase Children's National Salvation Aircraft for military use. All methods are currently being prepared and drafted. We hope that your association will provide guidance to facilitate progress. This is our hope. Addressed to the Aviation Association."</p>
<p>Donations Launched "Young Women's Aircraft". [Name], of [address], Jiangdu, sent a letter to the Chinese Aviation Association yesterday and mailed five yuan to launch a fundraising campaign to purchase a "Young Women's Aircraft." The original letter stated, "Dear Executive Director, many compatriots are enthusiastically donating to purchase aircraft to strengthen national defense. It can be seen that the Chinese people's patriotism is especially admirable. Some of my compatriots are also donating to purchase Children's Aircraft, saving the money they love to eat candy. I am [age] years old, and I am naturally unwilling to lag behind in loving the country, so I am sending five yuan, which I wanted to use to buy my favorite postcards. The aircraft I want to purchase is the 'Young Women's Aircraft.' Originally, this five yuan would not help, but I can imagine that the donations of young women who are more patriotic than me will be flowing in behind me. Many members of your association are working hard on aviation to save the country, and I greatly admire them. What our country currently lacks most is the training and cultivation of aviation pilots and talents for aircraft manufacturing. I hope your association will pay special attention, because they are also the talents that our country currently needs. I wish you good health, [name], February 10th."</p>

<p>Mr. Qu Wenliu, who had been to the Northeast to investigate relief efforts, received a letter from General Zhu Ziqiao of the Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang People's Support Association, which stated, "According to the [number] official letter of the Rehe Provincial Government, [names] of the [number] official letter of the Rehe Provincial Government, and [names] of the [number] official letter of the Rehe Provincial Government, the county magistrate of Suidong County, [name], and representatives of agriculture and commerce, [name], and the heads of agricultural and commercial associations of Kailu County, [name], have submitted requests, stating that the county has suffered from years of disaster and repeated banditry, and that merchants and residents are unable to survive. They have proposed relief measures and requested instructions and methods to maintain stability. According to this, after reviewing the various difficulties mentioned in the submissions of the two counties, they are all true. At a time when diplomacy is tight and military affairs are urgent, our province is also facing a serious shortage of funds and has countless matters to attend to. It is truly exhausted and unable to cope, and there are no relief measures. How should we handle this to maintain stability? In addition to exempting the land tax, we have ordered the relevant authorities to investigate and handle this matter separately, and we have separately submitted reports to the Central Executive Yuan, the Military Affairs Commission, the Beiping Political Committee, and the Military Affairs Commission for review and compliance, and ordered the relevant county governments to first instruct and inform them. We have also sent copies of the original submissions to your association for your review, hoping that you will quickly allocate relief funds to provide relief. We are also requesting a reply. As the counties on the Rehe border urgently need relief, we have previously requested assistance from the Central Committee and the Relief Committee. We subsequently received a telegram from the Relief Committee requesting coordination with your association. We have already sent a letter in the case. Now that the counties on the Rehe border are frequently suffering from disasters and lack food, and at a time when military affairs are urgent, we should quickly provide relief to benefit the people and maintain military supplies. We have sent a letter to reiterate the previous reason. In addition to replying, we are requesting that you review and handle the matter and quickly provide relief. We also hope to receive a reply. We are most grateful."</p>

<h3 id="e130">Puyi Real Estate Company Shareholder Meeting <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>Puyi Real Estate Company, located at 50 Nanjing Road in this city, convened its annual shareholder meeting yesterday on the third floor of the company. Chairman Dong [blank] Wen [blank] read the business report for the 21st year, which stated briefly: This year's business was very quiet due to the impact of the September 18th Incident last year. Although there is a lot of silver stored in Shanghai, capitalists are wary of investing in businesses due to the current situation. As a result, the construction industry has not made much progress, and real estate transactions, from an investment perspective, are almost at a standstill. However, there have been quite a few transactions of commercial and residential properties, with a total value of approximately [blank] 18 million taels.</p>
<p>Business Situation: This year, two new properties were purchased, both for expanding existing bases, requiring 39,000 taels of silver. Furthermore, 15 properties were sold, totaling 275,696.74 taels of silver. The construction department handled a total of 38 projects, of which 16 were built by the company itself, and the rest were built on behalf of other parties, valued at [blank] 577,000 taels. The company's construction value also reached 545,000 [blank] taels. The two items totaled 1,122,000 [blank] taels. The entire design, sampling, and supervision of these projects were undertaken by the company's construction department. The largest project this year was the Dahua Apartment located on Jing'an Temple Road, which was completed in early September. By the end of the year, 80-90% of it was rented out. The company's property acquisition has always been based on the standard of good location and rising land prices, and the acquired properties are developed as much as possible to increase income. As of the end of the year, the total value of these real estate properties was 16,123,472.25 taels, of which housing properties accounted for 12,566,029.48 taels, accounting for 77.94%, and land properties accounted for 3,530,902 taels, accounting for approximately 21.90%. Properties under construction accounted for 26,540.77 taels, accounting for approximately 0.16%. The total value of the above-mentioned real estate has been depreciated, calculated at the usual 4%, totaling 166,648.96 taels. Most of the company's properties are located in the Puyi Model Village and the bustling areas within the two concessions. As for the locations of all properties, the details are as follows in percentage: Public Concession 55.40%, French Concession 29.68%, Puyi Model Village 8.88%, Other Locations 6.04%. There are three properties in other locations, one on French Central Street in Tianjin, and the other two in the Special Second District of Hankou.</p>
<p>Comparison of Development: Since 1919, the company's growth has been even more [blank] progressive. According to the financial statements of the most recent three years, the value of its real estate and the annual rent collection are compared and listed as follows: At the end of 1919, 9,713,974.07 taels, at the end of 1920, 14,882,861.22 taels, and at the end of 1921, 16,123,472.25 taels. The comparison of rental income is as follows: 230,690.59 taels in 1919, 631,153.82 taels in 1920, and 708,943.80 taels in 1921.</p>
<p>Reserve Amount: The company's reserve fund totaled 1,033,763.19 taels by the end of the year. All depreciation on housing properties of 166,648.96 taels and depreciation on income-generating assets of 65,000.00 taels have been deducted from the asset accounts. In addition to the above-mentioned reserve fund, there is also an intangible reserve fund, which is the difference between the book value of the company's real estate and the market value estimated in May 1921. At that time, the book value, excluding depreciation, was 15,494,167.10 taels, while the price estimated based on market value was 19,164,228.00 taels. The difference between the two is 3,670,060.90 taels, accounting for about 23.68% of the total assets.</p>
<p>Last Year's Account Summary: This year, the company's net profit was 170,402.95 taels, plus 660,176.31 taels carried over from last year's profit and loss account, totaling 830,579.26 taels. The board of directors has allocated and paid the following: 191,996.64 taels for year-end dividends and cash bonuses paid on February 5, 1921; 60,174.93 taels transferred to the reserve fund account on April 13, 1921; 35,860.32 taels paid on June 30 for the semi-annual dividend of 6% on Class B preferred shares; 35,959.68 taels paid on December 31 for the semi-annual dividend of 6% on Class B preferred shares; 57,600.00 taels paid on December 31 for the annual dividend of 8% on Class A preferred shares. The remaining balance is 448,987.69 taels. On January 11 this year, the board of directors approved the distribution of a dividend of 7% to ordinary shareholders, which will cost 134,398.65 taels.</p>
<p>After Mr. Lei finished his report, all the accounts were approved by the entire body. The board of directors then thanked the shareholders for their enthusiastic support and all the staff for their loyal service. Finally, they rigorously recommended the company's staff and accountants before adjourning.</p>

<p>The rice millers met the day before yesterday (the 10th), with Zhu Zixiang presiding. He reported on the matter of changing to new measuring instruments, which had been resolved and announced to the industry on January 31. However, the Bean and Rice Industry Association recently obtained approval to use a six-dou Shi Hu, which has been permitted by the Social Affairs Bureau. However, the national government has issued an order to unify the [blank] weights and measures system, which does not allow any [blank] deviation. He asked, "What will our industry do? Please discuss." It was resolved that since the Social Affairs Bureau has already approved it, the industry will also use the six-dou Shi Hu for sales in this area, and those selling bags will use 210 pounds as a standard, which is 1.2 Shi Hu. The market price will be calculated on a Shi Hu basis. It was also resolved to modify the machine labor regulations, stipulating that for bags shipped to Shanghai, unloading will start at 200 pounds, and machine labor will remain the same as before. For bulk shipments to Shanghai, unloading will be based on Shi Hu, and machine labor will be reduced by two cents. It was also resolved to calculate bran and broken rice based on the Shi Hu and market scale as usual.</p>

<p>Department Store Market Opening Imminent: The department store market being prepared by the Shanghai Department Store Industry Association has been underway for many days since the election of committee members Wang Weiying, Zhang Wei, and Chen Huiqing to be responsible for the project. Yesterday, a meeting decided that the opening date will be February 20. Recently, various national goods manufacturers [blank] are being contacted to participate.</p>
<p>Nail Manufacturers Discuss Joint Operations: China's machine-made round nails were first created by the Gongqin [blank] Factory in Yangshupu ten years ago. At that time, due to the raw materials for nail manufacturing being [blank] from abroad, the cost was too high, making it difficult to develop. Later, the factory repeatedly designed and presented proposals to the government to improve the tax system. In recent years, it has been able to compete with imported foreign nails in the market. However, newly established nail factories in this city have sprung up one after another. To date, there are more than ten factories, large and small. According to current statistics, production has suddenly become oversupplied. Therefore, there is some competition in business. Currently, the industry feels that the cost is high and the selling price is low, and that continuing in this way is not a good strategy. Therefore, members of the industry have convened a general meeting to negotiate a unified selling price and appoint representatives to contact foreign nail manufacturers to discuss cooperation methods. It is said that representatives of Chinese and foreign factories have met several times. The content and opinions of the organization have not yet been determined, but the Chinese factory side has reached a unanimous agreement on its aims.</p>

<p>Yesterday afternoon at around 2:00 PM, a shocking kidnapping case occurred near the Taikoo Wharf on the Bund in the Southern City (designated as Wharf No. 6 by the Public Works Department). The victim was Zheng Xitang, a well-known shipping tycoon from Ningbo who had twice escaped kidnapping attempts. This was, in fact, his third encounter. Although he was not taken by the bandits, Zheng was shot in the head and is in critical condition. His Russian bodyguard died on the spot after being shot in the temple. Two police officers from the First District General Office were seriously wounded while bravely pursuing the kidnappers. A stray bullet injured a worker.

The incident occurred in a densely populated area, yet the bandits dared to carry out a brazen kidnapping in broad daylight, shooting and injuring multiple people. This is unprecedented in the Southern City. The details are as follows:</p>

<p>Zheng Xitang, a renowned shipping magnate in Shanghai, is 41 years old and from Zhenhai, Zhejiang. He is the eldest of three siblings. His wife, Madam Li, passed away last year. They had four sons and two daughters. The eldest son and daughter are adults and married, while the rest are young. Zheng's shipping business in Shanghai can be considered groundbreaking. His most notable ventures include the Lao Gong Mao Steamboat Company in Dongjiadu, the Ping An Company at 214 Bund in the Southern City, the Tongyu Shipping Company at 170-178 Beijing Road in the Public Concession, and the large-scale shipyard in Bailianjing, Pudong, all of which were founded by Zheng himself. In addition, he has various other side businesses too numerous to mention.</p>

<p>Zheng is by nature thrifty, diligent, and self-disciplined, with a strong sense of responsibility. He personally manages all his businesses and spares no effort. Seeing that Shanghai's west side was too bustling, he moved to Bailianjing in Pudong to avoid the noise. However, he personally goes to the Shanghai Awakening Steamboat Company every day to work, without fail, even in heavy wind and rain. Zheng rises at dawn every day, eats a quick meal, and comes to Puxi. He first goes to his office on Beijing Road, and after lunch, he goes to the Ping An Company in the Southern City. After finishing his work, he still needs to go to various places to handle trivial matters, returning home late at night. He is so diligent. Due to his busy work schedule, he only owns a small Austin car for transportation, license number 7021 in the concession (city number 5370).</p>
<h3 id="e143">One Aborted Kidnapping <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>Zheng's reputation has been increasing daily, but it has attracted the attention of bandits. It is recalled that in October 1930, Zheng encountered kidnappers near the Dada Wharf in the Southern City. At the time, the bandits were trying to force Zheng into a car parked nearby, but Zheng struggled with all his might. One bandit fired a shot at Zheng, and the bullet pierced Zheng's fur coat, luckily hitting a diary in his pocket, preventing him from being injured. Zheng then suddenly bit the wrist of the bandit holding the gun, causing the bandit to drop the gun out of pain. Zheng picked it up and threw it into the Huangpu River. At the same time, detectives arrived after hearing the news and arrested one bandit on the spot. The bandit was later executed.</p>

<p>After that, Zheng received letters from the bandits with various threats, but he ignored them. He then encountered danger in the concession once, but escaped unharmed. Not long after, one of Zheng's sons and daughters were approached by kidnappers at the school gate. The son escaped, but the daughter was abducted, though she was released within ten days. Since then, Zheng hired a Russian watchman, Saraeff, as a bodyguard and obtained a self-defense pistol (gun serial number 443803) to protect him at all times. Therefore, although the bandits had designed many times, they were never successful.</p>
<p>Loyal and Brave Russian Watchman Saraeff</p>
<h3 id="e145">Kidnapping Attempt Yesterday <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, at around 1:00 PM, Zheng went to the Ping An Company in the Southern City as usual. After finishing his work at 2:50 PM, Zheng arranged to go elsewhere with the deputy manager, Chen Yisheng. Just as Zheng and Chen were about to get into the car, and the bodyguard Saraeff was closing the car door, three kidnappers suddenly jumped out from the side of the road. One was burly and wore a gray cloth robe, one wore a dark blue cotton robe, and one wore a cloth robe with a plain-colored vest and a velvet hat. One bandit rushed to Saraeff, threatening him with a gun. Another bandit forced Deputy Manager Chen Yisheng out of the car and ordered him to go upstairs immediately.</p>
<h3 id="e146">Bodyguard Dies <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>Seeing that they had encountered bandits, Chen had no choice but to get out of the car and quickly go upstairs. He blew his police whistle wildly, but just as the whistle sounded, gunshots rang out downstairs. Three shots were heard, and Zheng and Saraeff were lying in a pool of blood. When Chen went upstairs, the Russian Saraeff tried to draw his gun to resist, but one bandit struck first and shot Saraeff in the head. The bullet hit the right temple, and he fell to the ground instantly, with his brains splattered. He was sent to Tongren Hospital, but it was too late, and he died. Saraeff's self-defense pistol was taken by the bandits. At the same time, the third bandit dragged Zheng out of the car.</p>
<h3 id="e147">Victim Shot and Seriously Wounded <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>Because Zheng had encountered bandits several times before,</p>
<p>he had escaped because of resistance.</p>
<p>This time, he wanted to follow the previous example, hoping for a stroke of luck. Unexpectedly, he angered the bandit, who shot Zheng in the head. The bullet entered from the top of the head and did not penetrate. Zheng also fell into the blood. Seeing that their goal had been achieved, the bandits fled west along South Yangjiadu Street. At that time, Zhang Dianyong and Yang Zhanbiao, two patrol officers from the First District General Office, arrived after hearing the gunshots. The bandits turned north into Shi Xiang Gong Alley through Wai Ma Gua Street, then north to Lao Taiping Alley, and then to Dadongmen. At that time, there was a crowd of people watching a fight, and the bandits took the opportunity to mix into the crowd and escape without a trace.</p>
<h3 id="e148">Both Police Officers Shot <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>When the two police officers Zhang and Yang were chasing, the three bandits opened fire along the way. Officer Yang was shot in the left shoulder when he chased to Yangjiadu. Officer Zhang was also seriously injured in the right arm. However, the two police officers did not flinch and chased all the way to Dadongmen. After the bandits disappeared, they returned to the station to report. Both were sent to Shanghai Hospital. Officer Zhang's elbow was broken, and Officer Yang's injury was lighter. As for Zheng Xitang, he was taken to Shanghai Hospital by the car driver Zhang Arong after being injured. After the doctor examined him, he believed that his brain had been severely injured and his condition was critical.</p>
<h3 id="e149">Zheng Moans on the Sickbed <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>After Zheng arrived at the hospital, he lost consciousness due to excessive blood loss. He woke up a little while later. At that time, reporters had arrived after hearing the news. They saw Zheng wearing an old purple lambskin coat, white on top and black on the bottom, a flannel short shirt and woolen undershirt inside, black leather shoes, and a gray scarf. All of these were covered in blood. He was lying diagonally and moaning, constantly calling for a cotton quilt, as there was only a wooden board on the bed. Zheng's eyes were swollen, and blood was constantly flowing from the wound on the back of his head. At 3:20 PM, an ambulance from Tongren Hospital arrived, and the doctor also came.</p>
<h3 id="e150">Condition Progressing Well <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>After the doctor from Tongren Hospital arrived at Shanghai Hospital, he first checked his pulse and then opened his eyelids. He saw that his eyeballs were protruding outwards and said that he was afraid that there was no hope of survival. At the same time, Zheng's family and friends arrived one after another, earnestly requesting that he be rescued. The doctor said that the bullet must be removed as soon as possible by surgery to see how his condition changed before a solution can be found. After speaking, Zheng was carried into the ambulance on a stretcher and taken directly to Tongren Hospital. Last night, when reporters went to inquire, they were told that his condition was progressing well. Afterwards, it was found that when the bandits opened fire to resist arrest along the way, a passerby named Hu Desheng, 36 years old, from Yangzhou, who was a worker on the Haimen steamboat, was shot in the right arm and left leg by stray bullets and was also sent to Shanghai Hospital.</p>
<h3 id="e151">China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Jianglun Transportation of Fish Changes Fee Dispute <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>Jiangsu and Jiangxin Detain More Than Two Hundred Buckets, Each Fish Store In Xiaodongmen Has Submitted An Negotiation. The Changjiang Steamship under China Merchants Steam Navigation Company transports fish from Hankou to Shanghai. The cost of each bucket is (dollars), the rest of the money is obtained by the crew and sailors. Now, the company is reorganizing the business and eliminating extra charges. From yesterday, staff members have been dispatched to detain the fish buckets transported on Jianglun, which has caused great disputes. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Fish Transportation Fee: The fresh fish from Changjiang is transported to Shanghai. The fish store commissioned Changjiang boat to load the buckets and transport them there. The Changjiang boats under China Merchants Steam Navigation Company also transport this kind of goods. However, because they cannot be put in the cabin, they are mostly stacked on the deck and platform. Each fish store pays two dollars and two and a half dollars for each bucket. However, this is not counted into the company's freight, but is divided up among the sailors on the boat. When Li Weihou was the general manager last year, a transportation fee method was agreed upon with the boat owners and sailor captains of the Changjiang boat: half a dollar is paid for each bucket of fish to the captain, who then turns it over to the boat owner, and then to the company. This money is then used to prepare uniforms for the sailors. This has always been implemented accordingly.</p>
<p>Change the Method: Since Liu Hongsheng took over as general manager, he has been actively carrying out changes to the business of the Changjiang boats, prohibiting sailors from engaging in extra charges. The company believed that it was a big loss to have no freight income for the fresh fish transported to Shanghai. Therefore, it was decided that the transport of the fish buckets would be formally collected by the company. Therefore, each Jianglun boat was informed to obey it. However, the captains of each boat believed that since each fish bucket loaded on the boat had been paid five cents which was collected by the boat owner, how could the company not receive it? This transportation fee rate was agreed upon by the previous general manager and was not extra charges privately transported. Therefore, it will still be loaded as usual.</p>
<p>Detain the Fish and Goods: The company dispatched manager Li Rongsheng from the Southern Building yesterday to inspect the boat when the Changjiang boat arrived at port and detain each fish bucket. Manager Li then lead staff and workers to wait at Jinliyuan Pier. When Jiangjing boat arrived at the port, Li discovered sixty buckets of fresh fish, which he then detained, unloaded on land, and stored in the eighth cargo warehouse. At about 4 p.m., Jiangxin boat arrived at Shanghai, and Manager Li discovered a large batch of fresh fish, a total of one hundred and several ten buckets, which were also stored in Jinliyuan Pier.</p>
<p>Negotiations with Merchants: The fresh goods stores in Xiaodongmen followed customs and sent workers to the pier to pick up the goods in order to transport them to the store and put them up for sale. Because fresh goods must be picked up immediately and cannot be delayed for a moment, each merchant sent representatives to the South Warehouse to negotiate with Li to request the fish buckets. It was to no avail. Each merchant then negotiated with the company and believed that the transportation fee had already been paid. If the company believed that the procedure was not compliant, the boat owner was at fault, and the merchants' fish buckets should not be detained. When the reporter drafted this report, this matter had not yet been resolved.</p>

<p>The case is scheduled to continue tomorrow. The Greyhound Association is suing Martin, the current extra Chief Inspector of the Public Works Department, and McNaughton, the former General Director.

The situation discussed yesterday morning has not yet been released. It is said that the association may not be able to provide a detailed explanation before the end of the prosecution because it believed that since it had refused to explain at the time in court, if it were to publish it now, it would be suspected of contempt of court.</p>
<p>As for the trial, the defendant's lawyer, Hobru, continued to present his defense on the afternoon before yesterday until it was almost time to adjourn. The trial will continue on Monday, and the plaintiff's lawyer, Harshi, will respond.</p>

<h3 id="e156">Shih Hui-hsin Takes a Concubine; After a Month, the Concubine Returns to Ningbo and Insists on Leaving <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>Lived Together for Thirty-Nine Days, Then the Concubine Demanded to Leave</p>
<p>Shih, Unwilling in His Heart, Accused the Concubine of Colluding to "Release White Doves" [a euphemism for fraud]</p>
<p>The Concubine Said She Was Not Fully Developed and Could Not Bear the Pain</p>
<p>Shih Hui-hsin of Ningbo, currently 41 years old, resides at No. 30 in the Xinniu Company Lane in the French Concession. He is engaged in the copper and iron business and has accumulated some savings. He has a wife and a son. Because Shih needs to continue the line of his deceased father's side of the family, he considered taking a concubine. He revealed his intentions to others, asking them to find a suitable woman. In September of last year, Shih's friends Yuan Jinchun and Hua Juquan introduced a woman named Yao Caiyun (also known as Ruiyun), who was willing to become a concubine. Yao was only seventeen years old and had a beautiful appearance. After Shih examined her once, he found her satisfactory and paid a tea ceremony gift of 1,000 yuan. However, after she entered his household, they only lived together for thirty-nine days, when due to</p>
<p>sexual relations, she developed a strong aversion. Yao then returned to Ningbo. Shih hired lawyer Chen Wenxiang to file a lawsuit with the First Special District Court, accusing Yao Ruiyun, Yao's parents Yao Bochun and Yao Lian, and the introducer Hua Juquan of colluding to defraud him of money. Attached was a civil lawsuit. The indictment stated: "Last September, Hua Juquan introduced Yao Bochun and his wife, fellow villagers, who intended to give their daughter Caiyun to be a concubine. The plaintiff, because he had to continue the line of Yao's father's side of the family, agreed to take her as a concubine. After several rounds of discussion, Caiyun agreed. On the 26th day of the tenth month of the same year, a voluntary agreement was written. The plaintiff paid</p>
<p>a tea ceremony gift of 1,000 yuan. Then, on the 31st day of the tenth month, he rented a house and lived with Caiyun. After she entered his household, he gave Caiyun an additional 400 yuan for savings. About 300 yuan was spent on clothing and miscellaneous items. On the 9th day of the twelfth month, Caiyun returned to her mother's house in Ningbo. Unexpectedly, he suddenly received a letter from lawyer Jiang Yiping, stating that he represented Yao Ruiyun and demanded to end the relationship. The plaintiff immediately checked his boxes and found that all 400 yuan in savings, as well as clothing, had been taken away. Thinking that Yao Caiyun had only lived with him for thirty days and had defrauded him of more than 1,700 yuan, this is what is called</p>
<p>"releasing white doves." The facts are clear. In addition to submitting evidence to the court, the plaintiff sues your court, requesting that the defendants be arrested and brought to justice, and punished according to Article 363 of the Criminal Law. He also demands that Yao Caiyun return to cohabit with him, or else requests compensation of 1,400 yuan, as well as clothing and miscellaneous items worth more than 300 yuan." The court approved the complaint, issued summonses, and dispatched constable Guo Xiangyao of the Chinese constabulary to deliver them. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Zhan Liangce presided over the interrogation in the Fifth Criminal Court. All four defendants were arrested, and lawyers Jiang Yiping and Wu Baotai were hired to defend them. The plaintiff, Shih Hui-hsin, testified that he was 41 years old, from Ningbo, and engaged in the copper and iron business. "Because my elder brother had no son and died years ago, and I only have one son, I wanted to take a concubine. I told people to</p>
<p>pay attention and look for a woman to continue the line of succession. In September of last year, my friend Yuan Jinchun brought a photo of a woman, saying that she was from Wuxi, named Yao Caiyun, and her parents were willing to have her become a concubine. So he set a date for a meeting. On October 26th, Yuan Jinchun, Hua Juquan, and Yao Bochun and his wife brought Caiyun to a hotel room. I went and considered her qualified. The defendants initially asked for a tea ceremony gift of 2,000 yuan, but I only agreed to 700 yuan. Later, we settled on 1,000 yuan. Yao Bochun and his wife then issued a written agreement, and the introducer signed it. I paid 1,000 yuan and took Yao back</p>
<p>to the rented house and lived with her for only thirty-nine days. On December 9th, Yao Bochun and his wife came to my house and said that because of the 'full moon' [one month after the wedding], they needed to take Caiyun back to stay temporarily. I thought this was customary, so I agreed. Unexpectedly, on January 7th, I suddenly received a letter from lawyer Jiang Yiping, saying that he represented Yao Caiyun and demanded to end the relationship with me. But I usually treated Caiyun very well. White fungus and other tonics were always available. Now she suddenly wants to leave, I don't know why. There is a 'releasing white doves' scheme to defraud me of money. Therefore, I filed a lawsuit, demanding that she be ordered to</p>
<p>compensate for the tea ceremony gift and other items, totaling 1,700 yuan." Under questioning, Yao Caiyun testified, "I was indeed married to Shih as a concubine by my parents. But at that time, I was only seventeen years old and my body was not fully developed. Therefore, it was agreed that we should not have sexual relations immediately after I entered his household, but wait two years and I should go to school. But after I entered his household, Shih did not abide by the agreement. On October 8th, he forced me to have sexual relations, causing injury to my lower body, and the pain was unbearable. I sent a letter to my mother to come to Shanghai and accompany me to Dr. Long Zhang's clinic for treatment. He confirmed that I had been injured and said that I could not have sexual relations for 120 days. After half a month of treatment, the injury improved slightly, and my mother returned home. But Shih's</p>
<p>lust arose again. On November 6th, he tried to force me to have sexual relations for the second time. I refused, and Shih used his fingers to dig into me, causing another injury. I was bedridden for several days, suffering greatly. Shih instructed the matchmaker to send a letter to my parents in Shanghai to reason with Shih, but it was ineffective. Therefore, I entrusted lawyer Jiang Yiping to send a letter to question him. Shih disregards human decency and forces sexual relations. Moreover, his treatment is very poor. Therefore, I am unwilling to go back with Shih." Yao Bochun and his wife also gave a testimony, which was largely the same as Caiyun's, but claimed that Shih was 46 years old, had three sons, two of whom were married. They acknowledged receiving 1,000 yuan for the tea ceremony gift, but denied</p>
<p>the 400 yuan in savings and clothing, etc. Witness Yuan Jinchun testified that he was a foreman in the warehouse of Jin Cheng Bank and a friend of Shih. Last year, Shih wanted to take a concubine and asked me to keep an eye out. One day, Hua Juquan invited me to a mahjong game and gave me a photo of a woman to look at, saying that he wanted to betroth her to me. I took it back to Shih to look at, and he found it suitable. So I entrusted Hua to send a letter to Wuxi, inviting Yao Bochun and his wife to come to Shanghai with Caiyun. We agreed on a tea ceremony gift of 1,000 yuan in the hotel, and then she entered his household. I don't know about the rest. Hua Juquan gave a testimony, and then the lawyers for both sides stood up to debate for a long time. Judge Zhan announced that the debate on this case was over and that the verdict would be announced on the 17th of this month.</p>
<p>Regarding this, our Association, standing as a third party, should handle this matter. We ask all comrades to express their opinions." Chen Yiyan, Gu Bingyuan, Hu Xiwei, Lin Chao, Xu Baohua, and others successively expressed their opinions. The Secretariat presented a joint letter from 45 factories, requesting a temporary motion. Chairman Wang retreated from his position due to business, and Chen Yiyan was elected as Chairman. The Chairman summarized the opinions of the majority and proposed three motions, requesting a vote: (1) Goods that are not purely sold under the trademark of national goods should not be certified as national goods. The Desiling bulb should be jointly investigated by representatives from the Association and the Electrical Manufacturing Association. The deadline for reporting to the meeting is next Monday, and a decision will be made. (2) The name of the manufacturing factory should be clearly indicated on the Desiling bulb, and the manufacturer should guarantee it before it can be certified. This was unanimously approved. It was also decided to hand over the first motion to the executive committees of the two associations for handling. It was already 6 o'clock, and the meeting was adjourned with a bell.</p>

<p>48 North Henan Road, Phone 45093 The employees of Huada Water and Electrical Materials Store, feeling deeply the violent plundering of our Northeast by the Japanese, and the evil deeds against our compatriots, have created a move to transfer repair wages to help the Volunteer Army. If any patriotic compatriots in this city have electrical equipment malfunctions or damage to tap water and sanitary appliances, they can directly send a letter or call the store, and craftsmen will be sent immediately to repair them. All the repair wages earned will be used to supplement the Northeast Volunteer Army. Although it is a drop in the bucket and cannot solve the problem, it is also a slight effort to fulfill the meaning of "those with money donate money, those without money contribute labor." The store also deeply hopes that fellow water and electricity industry members will follow suit and rise up.</p>

<p>Since the January 28th Incident, the business of the cigarette exchange industry association in this city has been declining day by day. Recently, competition has intensified, and the selling prices of various cigarettes have been disrupted by cheap prices, which has harmed the overall business. Many fellow traders have lost their capital. The association believes that this situation is not beneficial to the industry in the long run. On the 7th of this month, it convened executive supervisors and representatives from wholesale companies throughout the city to discuss together. As a result of the meeting, all industry operators must join the association and obtain a certificate. Those operating in the market must pay an additional market fee. When issuing cigarettes from cigarette companies or wholesale cigarettes from cigarette shops, they must have a certificate of association to prove it, and keep detailed records of the number in the cigarette issuance books and cigarette wholesale books to prevent disorder. Otherwise, the price will be considered that of an individual customer. The Committee for Reorganizing Market Prices, in addition to the executive supervisors as ex officio members, also elected 15 other members to take special responsibility. Several draft proposals were passed, and it was decided to hold another meeting at the association hall at No. 487 Ningbo Road at 2:00 PM on the 13th of this month. At that time, each cigarette company will also be asked to send responsible representatives to attend and discuss, cooperate, and decide on various methods. A formal document will be submitted to the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs and various courts for filing, and a notice will be requested to be issued. If there is any violation of the execution, it will be strictly prohibited. The general purpose is to benefit the industry, maintain capital, and maintain business.</p>

<h3 id="e164">Going into Monkhood and Returning to Lay Life丨Letter from Ms. Jiang Xin丨 <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>I am a half-monastic single woman. When I was five or six years old, my mother died, and my father sent me to a monastic woman with hair to be her apprentice, and I went to a dilapidated temple to become a monk. At that time, I was ignorant and followed my so-called master to chant scriptures every day, but I didn't understand at all what the scriptures said. When I grew to be more than ten years old, my master left all the affairs of the temple to me. All the begging for rice, fundraising, receiving guests, running errands, and everything else, internal and external, was all done by me alone, from morning to night, and I was endlessly busy. My so-called master was just muddleheaded and enjoyed the fruits of my labor. She saw that I was lively, hardworking, and able to endure hardship, and she was very pleased, so she tried every means to win me over, so that I would loyally serve her. But she was still afraid that I would not be a beast of burden for the rest of my life, so not long after, she took in an apprentice for me, and said more nice words to appease my heart. From the outside, it seemed that she was very kind to me, but she didn't like my father and brothers very much, and she rarely favored my relatives and friends who were kind to me. When I was over twenty years old, in those ten years or so, through my personal hard work (which was actually the result of deception), I created everything: the dilapidated temple was renovated by me and looked brand new; the peeling Buddha statues were sculpted by me and shone with gold. I had long realized that the reason why a person becomes a monk is nothing more than that they have bad luck in the middle of their life and are forced to do so. If they really want to practice Zen and enlightenment, they must be able to be clean and quiet. How can I be a true monk with such hard work? Moreover, with such hard work and effort, would I not be able to obtain a good position in society? So why should I bury my useful body in an inexplicable place, living an inhuman life, and ending my days as an outcast? Therefore, I resolved that after completing the two tasks of renovating the temple and sculpting the statues, fulfilling my little wish, I would then return to lay life and restore my original freedom. But my master used every means to control me and refused to let me go, still wanting to use me as her lifelong beast of burden, so that I could never turn over! She already knows my thoughts. She also knows that her tricks of hypocrisy and righteousness are ultimately not enough to trap me, so she uses threats, threatening to die. According to what she told people, if I ran away on my own, she would say that I had run away with someone, report it to the authorities for arrest, and if they couldn't catch me, she would say that my father and brothers had tempted and hidden me, stirring up trouble, and she would sue my father and brothers. In this way, I would have no way to escape her trap. Sir, I am a woman, weak and ignorant. How can I withstand such threats? Therefore, I am raising the following questions and hoping that you can teach me: (1) Are monks beneficial to the country and society, or are they harmful to the country and society? (2) Is it a dishonorable thing for a monk to return to lay life? (3) Does a monk need to obtain the master's consent before returning to lay life, or can they act freely? (4) Is there any legal relationship between master and apprentice? (5) If a master does not want an apprentice to return to lay life and therefore seeks death, should the apprentice bear legal responsibility? (6) If one returns to lay life without the master's permission, is it considered a private escape? Should one be legally bound for fleeing because one does not want to be a monk? (7) After I freely return to lay life, can the master demand my return from my father and brothers? (Reply to be published tomorrow)</p>

<p>Regulations on the Powers and Responsibilities of Primary and Secondary Schools to be Promulgated Simultaneously After the Legislative Yuan passed the Normal School Law and the Primary and Secondary School Law, the Ministry of Education had already drafted regulations for primary and secondary schools and regulations for vocational schools. These have been passed by the ministry's meetings in phases and are being sorted out and finalized. The regulations for normal schools were discussed at the ministry's meeting on the 9th and 10th of this month. Vice Ministers, Directors, Secretaries, Councilors, Supervisors, Section Chiefs, etc. all attended the discussion. A total of more than 130 regulations, one-third were passed on the 9th, and the general outline was passed on the 10th. After further sorting out, they will be promulgated simultaneously with the regulations for middle schools, primary schools, and vocational schools. It is heard that the Normal School Law passed by the Legislative Yuan previously did not address the status of rural teachers. There are currently more than 550 rural normal schools across the country. The Ministry of Education, based on the requests of rural teachers in various provinces, has provided considerable relief in the drafting of normal school regulations. This discussion held that in order to promote universal education, as Chinese villagers account for 70-80% of the population, normal schools, in addition to those located in cities, should be established in rural areas. Normal schools that are specifically designed to train rural primary school teachers may also be called rural normal schools. The entire regulations are relatively concrete and adaptable to the organization of normal schools and all necessary conditions.</p>

<h3 id="e171">Remarks by Mr. Pan Gongzhan, Director of the Municipal Bureau of Education, on "Education in Shanghai" (Part 4) <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>Overview of School Education and Social Education</p>
<p>Firstly, due to the large number of illiterate people in society, which is the biggest obstacle to all new construction in China, before the implementation of universal compulsory education, we must first start with "establishing more public schools" to achieve the first step of "compulsory education for the common people." Here, we can compare the number of public schools established in the first session six years ago with the number of public schools established this year.</p>
<p>First Session: 20 schools, 354 graduates</p>
<p>Seventh Session: 54 schools, 1453 graduates</p>
<p>From this, we can see the efforts made since the establishment of the Shanghai Municipal Government. The number of schools has increased nearly threefold, and the number of graduates has increased more than fourfold. We believe that in a few years, these public schools will have even greater development, and the suffering of illiterate people and the reduction of many social ills caused by "the causes of illiteracy" will make us very optimistic about the future of overall social construction.</p>
<p>In addition, in order to enable some merchants and workers to gain knowledge after work, several supplementary schools have been established, which are also completely free. These supplementary schools also have a history of five years. The first session only opened four schools, but now it has expanded to nineteen schools. The number of students has also increased from forty to four hundred and fifty.</p>
<p>From the annual increase in the number of schools and students, it is clear that we attach importance to social education and the effective response we have received from implementing social education.</p>
<p>Secondly, in addition to establishing free public schools and supplementary schools, the Municipal Bureau of Education also has the following facilities for the implementation of social education:</p>
<p>㈠ Public Education Center: It has fixed activities such as "popular lectures," "academic lectures," "public entertainment," "museum exhibitions," and "reading of books and newspapers." In addition, various gatherings related to social activities are held from time to time, such as "public hiking meetings," "speech contests," etc.</p>
<p>㈡ Library: Currently, there is only one municipal library, which was established only one year ago, so the content is not very rich. However, all architectural equipment has been carefully designed, and there are already established steps for expansion plans. It is expected that there will be rapid development within five years.</p>
<p>㈢ Mobile Library: This mobile library is very convenient for the general public, because the public in this city can borrow books from the library to read, the procedures are very simple, and there is no charge.</p>
<p>㈣ Zoo: The zoo is newly established, so the content is not very rich. However, it has already aroused considerable interest among the general public.</p>
<p>㈤ Public School Gardens: These public school gardens are provided to help students study natural sciences. All common plants in natural science textbooks are available. Not only can students get the convenience of self-study and appreciation in natural sciences, but also provide a place for some citizens to relax and enjoy themselves after work.</p>
<p>㈥ Public Sports Field: Promoting physical education is a task that the education authorities pay close attention to. Therefore, the equipment of public sports fields is also expanding day by day. We can only use the number of people exercising in public sports fields as evidence to know the strong interest of the citizens in physical education and the greatness of its inevitable effect. At the same time, because there is only one public sports field and the area of this city is very vast, six simple public sports fields have been established in various districts so that the public scattered in various districts have places to exercise and engage in sports. In the future, some more of these simple sports fields will be added to make physical education the most common training.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned social education facilities are all managed by the Municipal Bureau of Education. In addition, there are many public schools and cultural institutions privately established by the public in this city, which can help the government's social education facilities. According to the latest statistics, the following are available:</p>
<p>Libraries 12 Vocational Training Institutes 5 Supplementary Schools 17</p>
<p>Cultural and Educational Groups 44 Correspondence Schools 3 Special Schools (Deaf and Mute Education)</p>
<p>Total 82</p>
<p>In addition, we believe that social education has a special meaning for "public entertainment," so we pay extreme attention to public entertainment at the same time.</p>
<h3 id="e172">Development of Southeast Women's Physical Education School <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>The Southeast Women's Physical Education School started on the 6th of this month. The new students in this school are very enthusiastic. Recently, they have been busy registering and paying fees, and classes will officially begin on the 13th. More than a dozen graduates from the upper classes have been hired by various primary and secondary schools in the country before the New Year. It is said that some schools failed to get their wishes due to late letters of employment, and many were greatly disappointed. However, since the school hired Wen Yujun, a graduate of the Physical Education Department of Northeast University, last summer to preside over academic affairs, there has been development in both academics and promotion matters, and it is showing a rapid pace of progress. Now, Guo Xiaofen (also a graduate of the Physical Education Department of Northeast University) has been hired as a full-time teacher. Mr. Guo has rich knowledge and superb skills. Moreover, the school has built a large and well-equipped new school building since the autumn of last year, including a gymnasium, a track and field, and various outdoor ball courts. All physical education facilities are available. It strives to become the only complete women's physical education school in Shanghai. The future is really limitless.</p>
<h3 id="e173">New Faculty Hired for Patriotic Physical Education Department <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>After the Shanghai War, the Patriotic Girls' School is still actively reviving in the Jiang Wan Road Garden. In addition to building dormitories and purchasing school supplies to engage in material construction, it is also making every effort to innovate in terms of curriculum arrangement and teaching management. The school has junior high school, senior high school, general courses, and normal school courses. The content is rich. This semester, it is paying more attention to the physical education department and raising the level. Li Jiyuan, the former director of physical education at Tongji University, has been hired as the director of the physical education department. Liu Zhiping, a music professor at Xinhua Art University, and Ms. Zhong Muzhen have been hired as music instructors. Ms. Chen Mulan, a dance expert, has been hired as a dance teacher. The school's physical education department has a history of more than 20 years and has trained a large number of talents. Now, it is paying more attention to the training of knowledge and skills in order to train healthy talents in the women's physical education field. It is reported that the school's physical education department and various departments of senior and junior high school still have vacancies for students to join the classes.</p>

<p>It has been a long time since we saw good football, and the continuous cloudy and rainy days combined with snow. Yesterday, it suddenly cleared up. In addition, the Western United Football Association's announcement made the Recreation Ground very crowded with guests, around three to four thousand. It was thought that there might be some outstanding players in the navy, but I did not know that they were still depressed. The forwards were okay, but the defenders were not good. The left winger Du Lie Lan was the most outstanding of the forwards. He made several passes, which were fast and accurate, and were worth watching. The weakness of the defenders, when the Donghua forwards attacked, made them flustered and at a loss. For a time, the whole field suddenly burst into laughter.</p>

<p>In the first half, the navy took the offensive. Although the progress was not fast, the attack was fierce. They often hovered around the Donghua field. The wingers had occasional long shots. Seven minutes after the start of the game, Donghua broke through the navy. Li Yichen made a long pass from the right corner. Chen Yutian rushed in like a fly. The navy quickly started to chase back. Yutian had reached 15 yards from the enemy's goal. He calmly flew into the net. Donghua won 1-0. Yutian got another chance to break through, but failed. The navy was still attacking fiercely. Du Lie Lan's central pass was almost headed in. Li Yichen suddenly touched the ball with his hand 25 yards in front of the goal. Brown kicked a free kick, which was as fast as an arrow. It hit the right post and bounced into the goal. 1-1, each scored a goal. Courtesy demands reciprocity.</p>

<p>At this time, the situation was still tense. Donghua gradually saw the offensive, but the repeated long shots did not score. At 20 minutes, Li Yichen passed to Chen Yutian. Chen got the ball and went straight forward. He kicked the ball flat in front of the goal from the corner. Li Yichen saw the opportunity in front of him. He could not kick it, so he jumped up and headed the ball right in the middle. The ball went into the goal, and Li fell straight in front of the goal. Applause rang out. In less than three minutes, Wan Xianghua got a pass from Li Yichen, broke through two barriers in a row, and shot diagonally towards the goal, and it went into the net again. Donghua won 3-1.</p>
<h3 id="e187">Center Back Colors <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>There were still 25 minutes left in the first half. Feng Yunyou, the center back, also went forward to assist the attack and also scored a goal. Donghua was in a melee in front of the navy's goal, but there were no results. The navy also got a corner kick, but it was still ineffective. Jiaqiu avoided it and passed it to Yutian, but the shot was also unsuccessful. Wan Xianghua attacked on the left and got a corner kick opportunity. It fell in the center. Feng Yunyou came at the right time and rushed to shoot hard. The sound was crisp and accurate. In the first half, Donghua 4, Navy 1.</p>
<h3 id="e188">Another One <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>Five minutes after the start of the second half, after the navy got a corner kick, Wan Xianghua rushed straight in again, in front of the navy's goal. There was only one defender, Stephen. Li Yichen and Chen Jiaqiu also rushed to the scene together. It was a great opportunity, but it was lost. Feng Yunyou stepped forward and held it up. The navy's goalkeeper was forced to come out to defend. A defender took his place. For a time, it caused a burst of laughter. Chen Yutian's pass, Chen Hongguang finally attacked inside, adding another one. Donghua won 5-1.</p>
<h3 id="e189">Even to the Point of Switching Sides <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>At this time, the navy was attacking fiercely in front of Donghua's goal. Bao Ai's header almost hit the goal. Zhou Xianyan saved it and became a corner kick. From Bai Nate to Li Te, he shot towards the goal, and it happened to fall into the hands of the iron gate, and it was still ineffective. Du Lie Lan shot again and it was unsuccessful. In a blink of an eye, Chen Yutian flew straight in, unstoppable. Stephen raised his foot to intercept, and a bounce hit his own goal, causing a 6-1 own goal. Finally, Li Yichen Wan Xianghua added two more goals, and the game ended 8-1.</p>

When the second half started, Youth suddenly gained momentum, and Cheng Jingxing's long shots were accurate every time, winning a lot of applause. Wu Youliang and Tao Zunan were valiant, while Tongji was clumsy. The score became 18-18. Afterwards, Youth once overwhelmed Tongji 31-21. Tongji was greatly frustrated by this and tried hard to cheer up, competing equally, and finally Youth won 33-27.</p>

<h3 id="e200">The Liangjiang Women's Basketball Team Augments Its Strength by Inviting Three Outstanding Athletes from Southeast to Participate in the Expedition <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>Forward Pan Yueying, Guards Wang Zhixin and Lu Xueqin, Southeast Principal Approves Request, Parents' Consent Being Sought, Shen Siliang Expresses Opinions on Liangjiang's Expedition</p>
<p>The Liangjiang Women's Basketball Team is about to embark on an expedition to Europe and America. To bolster its strength, it has specially invited outstanding athletes from Southeast University to participate. Shen Siliang has also offered opinions on Liangjiang's expedition. A summary is recorded below:</p>
<p>Inviting Southeast to Participate: The Liangjiang Basketball Team is preparing to embark on an expedition to Europe and America. To augment its strength, the school's principal, Lu Lihua, personally invited Southeast University graduates and outstanding basketball players Ms. Pan Yueying, Ms. Wang Zhixin, and Ms. Lu Xueqin to join the team on the trip to America. The three ladies are renowned basketball athletes at sea. Pan Yueying as a forward, Wang Zhixin and Lu Xueqin as guards, their skills are equally remarkable, and they are all outstanding talents. During the New Zhejiang Construction Games, Ms. Pan, Wang, and Lu, along with Liangjiang forwards Chen Rongming and Yang Sen, and guards Huang Shuhua, represented the Shanghai mixed team in a performance against the Hangzhou mixed team, earning high praise and admiration at the venue. Ms. Pan, Wang, and Lu are currently seeking the consent of their parents and have also consulted with Southeast University's President Yu Ziyu and Director of General Affairs Qin Xingshi. Ms. Yu and Qin are highly supportive, considering it a matter of national importance, hoping to bring glory to the country and set a new record in the Chinese women's basketball community, and so on.</p>
<p>Shen Siliang's Opinion: Mr. Shen Siliang, honorary secretary of the Shanghai Chinese Athletic Association, expressed the following opinions regarding the Liangjiang Women's Basketball Team's overseas expedition:</p>
<p>In the past, Chinese people often engaged in empty talk without action, criticizing others' work instead of doing it themselves. However, from this expedition of the Liangjiang Girls' School basketball team to Europe and America, it seems that things have changed significantly. Observing the history and achievements of the Liangjiang basketball team, it is clear that they do not suffer from the ailment of empty talk without action. They simply put in the effort practically, doing what they say, constantly working diligently and moving forward. Although they defeated Japan twenty years ago, they show no signs of complacency, remaining humble and eager to learn from the sports of other countries in Europe and America, integrating their essence to create independent and outstanding sports. This kind of grand ambition, far-reaching vision, and arduous work, they are willing to dedicate years to, traveling across oceans to accomplish. It is truly admirable.</p>
<p>Their declaration states that considerations of victory or defeat are not their primary concern. Although these are words of humility, we cannot judge the value of their trip based on their success or failure, or on our own pessimistic speculations. Their trip abroad comes at a time when the nation faces numerous challenges, and the world is observing the survival capabilities of the Chinese nation after our revolution. This trip can and should provide foreigners with some new stimulation, changing their perceptions of our nation. Their ambition is commendable, and their intentions are virtuous. It is no different from the heroic spirit of going to the enemy with generosity and sacrifice. As the elders say, establishing the beginning of self-strengthening as pioneers for men, truly demonstrates its significance.</p>
<p>Furthermore, since the school began preparations and implementation, the Chinese people have also changed their past negative attitude of criticizing others' work, instead providing active and practical assistance. The public opinion following the disclosure of this news in various newspapers has been consistently enthusiastic and encouraging. Therefore, I dare to predict that the Chinese people will definitely help them succeed. Moreover, I hope the Liangjiang basketball team will strive diligently and live up to the hopes of the nation.</p>

<p>— Zhou Jia</p>
<p>Wandering, wandering, I don't know how far I wandered, and I ended up stumbling into a small vegetable market. Wow! The vegetable market was really crowded! The women, a bunch here, a group there, arguing with the vegetable vendors over greens, tofu, and gluten, elbows bumping into baskets, baskets bumping into scales, it was a real mess. I squeezed in, taking every opportunity to stretch out my five fingers, pinching this, fondling that, it was quite enjoyable. But that couldn't satisfy my hunger! Just as I was hesitating, thinking about sneaking away to another place to find food, I suddenly ran into two fellow gamblers, setting up a game of chance right there, "guessing the coffin."</p>
<p>Heh! These two guys are really something! They actually came here to do business. How come I didn't think of that? All those women are greedy for small gains, as long as you set the hook, you're not afraid of not catching a fish. But where are the patrolmen? I looked for a long time but couldn't find any. Could it be that these two guys have such incredible courage that they aren't afraid of the cops or the street vendors, so they came out to do business? I quietly walked up, and gently called out to the dealer:</p>
<p>"Li Si, you little rascal."</p>
<p>Li Si turned around, saw me, and quickly gave me a wink, reaching back with his arm, giving me two small silver coins. I knew he wanted me to help him attract customers. Fine! I'll help you attract customers, and then you'll have to share with me. I bet on three, and a three came up, I bet on four, and a four came up. Betting back and forth like this, I almost took all the small silver coins in Li Si's hand. A large crowd of women gathered around to watch the excitement.</p>
<p>One woman gave me a small silver coin, wanting me to bet with her. As soon as I took it, I performed a magic trick, turning one coin into two. Heh! This fish is hooked! The woman's eyes were really small, getting two small silver coins, she smiled from ear to ear and started betting herself, not needing my help anymore. Good! I'll watch you bet. Bet on three, get a four; bet on four, get a three. In short, the three of us, working together, took all the grocery money from many women's pockets, then packed up our tools, leaving those women standing there dumbfounded, their eyes red with anger.</p>
<p>Li Si's conscience wasn't bad. After the game, in a dark alley, he divided eight small silver coins to me. It's been a long time since I've had so much money. I'm really lucky today, wherever I go, I make a profit! These past two days, I've been eating nothing but potstickers, my mouth is starting to taste bland. Today, I have to change my taste. I immediately rushed into a Yangchun noodle restaurant, ordered a bowl of noodles with extra broth, and ate and drank to my heart's content.</p>
<p>But, ill-gotten gains come quickly and go quickly. As soon as I ran out of the noodle restaurant, I ran into a few young men selling sesame twists and salted peanuts, clanging their copper coins on the steps at the corner of a doorway. As soon as I saw that, my heart started to flutter, and I joined in. Clanging the copper coins for three hours, I lost two small silver coins; plus, I bought a few puffs of opium and a few pieces of dried tobacco, and my eight small silver coins were reduced to five.</p>
<p>If I use these five small silver coins carefully, I can definitely use them for ten days or so. I tucked them tightly into my inner pocket. Today, I don't want to gamble anymore. (To be continued)</p>
<h3 id="e202">Monster and Beast Movies <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>— Xuan</p>
<p>According to statistics from the Mainland Press, the best-selling films in Shanghai last year were "Same Heart Knot," "Tarzan the Ape Man," "A History of the Red Chamber," "Frankenstein," "Dragon and Tiger Fight," and other five films. It is remembered that the opening of "Paradise for Women" at the Nanjing Grand Theater on New Year's Day this year sold out even the tickets for the second showing one hour before the first showing. "Tarzan the Ape Man," "Frankenstein," "Dragon and Tiger Fight," and "Paradise for Barbarian Women" are all so-called monster, barbarian, and beast movies, which are not realistic life themes. This kind of non-realistic life monster, barbarian, and beast films (and even novels) were popular in Europe and America two years ago, and have not declined to this day, and Shanghai has also been affected.</p>
<p>The meaning is that the general public desires to "escape reality!"</p>
<p>Why escape reality? Because in this cruel and competitive society, they feel there is no way out; because this declining capitalist society is already "spiritually bankrupt," as many fascist scholars in Europe have painfully confessed. From the escape from reality, we see the decadence, confusion, and pessimism of the declining class. This is their subconscious revelation!</p>
<p>On the other hand, because movies are a universal art for the masses, the ruling class must take advantage of it. They have tried to deceive the public on the screen, such as the many "ideal future world" films released in 1929-30 (one of which is "Metropolis," the Chinese translation seems to be "Scientific World"); they have also tried to "prepare consciousness" for the Second World War, such as the endless "martial" war films in recent years. In addition to these two, they also cleverly "avoid reality" and guide the eyes of the general public to monsters, beasts, and barbarians. This is to anesthetize the audience!</p>
<p>Just because one party intentionally wants to avoid reality, and the other party, the general public, subconsciously wants to escape reality, then monster, beast, and barbarian films sell extremely well!</p>
<p>However, it is precisely on this point that we see the world's ruling class frantically and the confusion, hesitation, decadence, and pessimism of the general public under their "education."</p>
<h3 id="e203">The Strange Custom of Widow Suicide in India <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>— Wan Ju</p>
<p>Widow suicide is a product of the strange concept of chastity of Indians, and it can also be said to be a characteristic of Indian civilization. I don't know when this matter started. We can't find this rule in the Vedas, which shows that there was no such cruel custom in ancient India. However, there is such a record in "Puranas" (ancient history of India): "A widow who can ascend the cremation altar with her husband's remains is a chaste woman, and she can enter heaven after death. If a widow survives after her husband's death, especially if she remarries, then she will not be qualified to follow her husband in the next life." Because of this absurd legend, this inhumane custom occurred. Although many people in modern times have criticized this bad custom, Indian widows, even if they do not commit suicide, dare not remarry; although there are occasional exceptions, they are rare. On December 4, 1829, Indian Governor-General William. Mettingk promulgated a law that absolutely prohibits the burning of widows, and violators will be sentenced to death. However, when this law was implemented, it unexpectedly encountered major obstacles: generally ignorant women, seduced by monks and religious superstitions, shouted loudly that they were willing to be burned to death to be martyred for their husbands: Therefore, the authorities had to let them act freely. If the government really adopted tough prohibition measures, it might cause serious chaos. Fortunately, later, the relatives of the widow issued a statement stating that they did not insist on burning the widow, so the authorities reiterated the ban, and this custom in British India gradually disappeared. However, after the 1860 rebellion, the Olts area openly burned widows again, and as a result, the perpetrators were sentenced to death; in 1875, this inhumane act occurred in the Laknu area, and the court prosecuted 30 people involved for murder and sentenced them to death. After that, this custom was no longer seen in British India, but in the native princes’ countries, there was no way to stop it.</p>
<p>When the burning ceremony is about to be held, many people from far and near gather spontaneously to watch this sacrificial ceremony. The widow is dressed in gorgeous clothes like a bride, supported by her close relatives, and monks and religious superstitious people surround her. The unfortunate widow is led to the cremation ground in the interweaving of music. The road from home to the cremation ground is paved with leaves, bouquets and palm trees. If the widow who is about to commit suicide is still energetic, she will throw money to the beggars on the side of the road while walking, but most of the widows at that time are completely unconscious; because before the suicide is carried out, people often drink a kind of anesthetic made of Indian cannabis.</p>
<p>In that extremely tragic silence, the crowd surrounded the cremation altar. The widow slowly circled the altar three times, then the monk</p>

<p>— Zhang Ping</p>
<p>She embraced him and went up the stairs from the second floor. He also followed the momentum and stepped onto the stairs. When he came to his room, he noticed that she was only wearing a velvet white pajamas, a large area of her snowy white chest was exposed, and she was wearing a pair of short floral pants underneath. Her entire calf below the knees was exposed.</p>
<p>"What a moving pose!"</p>
<p>He forgot the current predicament again, and only indulged in admiring her semi-naked posture like a glutton.</p>
<p>"Oh my! How embarrassing!"</p>
<p>She laughed, covered her face with both palms, and turned around like a little girl, running downstairs.</p>
<p>After seeing her leave, his mind gradually calmed down. He felt that his actions just now were too reckless. Apologize to them? A dignified Chinese citizen can't do that. I would rather defend the land to the death than lose an inch of land from my hands! But staying here is not a good idea strategically. Who can predict how this predicament will unfold?</p>
<p>"Thirty-six strategies, running away is the best strategy!"</p>
<p>Thinking of this, he hurriedly put on his shoes and socks, then buttoned up his coat. He couldn't pack anything, so he only took his necessary wallet, toothbrush, and towel, and rushed downstairs. Fortunately, he didn't run into Mrs. Tsuruko on the way, nor did he see the maid. He walked out of the alley entrance and suddenly saw the beautiful girl who came with that Japanese guy, still wearing gorgeous Japanese clothes, holding four brick-shaped breads in her hand, walking from the other side. When she saw Haiquan, she smiled and bowed to him.</p>
<p>"This is really an angel descended from heaven!"</p>
<p>He felt a lot of shameful contradictions, but he couldn't help but return a salute. He hurried to the tram stop.</p>
<p>"That old guy is her father, then that little girl is her sister, right, that's definitely right."</p>
<p>Thinking this, he was ashamed again, his whole mind was still dominated by her. He couldn't help but sigh again.</p>
<p>The priest then helped her onto the place where her husband's body was placed. At a distance of a few steps from the body, she was made to sit cross-legged; sometimes the dead person's head was placed on the widow's lap. Then she was tied to the firewood pile on the cremation altar. Some people poured oil as much as possible, and some hurriedly lit the fire. After the fire was lit, the monks recited scriptures and sang hymns loudly, and relatives began to cry, and trumpets and drums were played all around. This disturbance could prevent the tragic cries from being heard. If the widow was burned and in pain, broke the rope, and jumped out of the raging fire to escape, the cruel monks would rush to catch her and throw her back into the fire.</p>
<p>If a widow has an attempt to avoid her own tragic fate, the monks and her relatives will consider it an ominous sign, the most unlucky thing, and the soul of the dead will not become a Buddha. Sometimes, for fear that the widow would resist, when she climbed onto the cremation altar, people also used a large and heavy bamboo pole to press on her shoulders, making it impossible for her to stand up.</p>
<p>When the cremation altar was still slightly burning, the crowd dispersed silently. Usually, the widow's body was not completely burned. The relatives cleaned up the altar and remains and buried them together.</p>
<p>Although this tragic and cruel custom stems from religious superstition, the concept of husband and wife as one is also an important factor!</p>

<p>— Ms. Peng Xuezhen</p>
<p>I really don't understand why I hate Suzhou so much, although I have been living in this world all the time.</p>
<p>I like majesty, and I like the atmosphere of those straightforward people. In Suzhou, I was disappointed. Everything pays attention to beauty, people are like sugar figurines, sticky and lively, blood is out of the question, the average people are as leisurely as stagnant water, motionless, as if there is no source of life. Suzhou people are particularly strong in their housekeeping, and those who have a little food don't want to run outside. For the sake of a comfortable life, many people from other provinces have come to live in Suzhou in recent years.</p>
<p>In Suzhou, there are particularly many unemployed young masters, and they can spend the long days without any effort. Teahouses and hotels are booming, probably for this reason. When you have nothing to do, buy some calligraphy and paintings to play with, invite someone to play a tune, and act as an amateur; smoke and gambling also embellish this leisurely life. Suzhou women are also almost the same as modern girls, with a bit of the atmosphere of Lin Daiyu in the 20th century.</p>
<p>Except for the few existing roads, most of the roads are paved with stones, and it hurts to walk a long way; on drizzly days, that slippery feeling is really good, but this is only known to people who walk on foot.</p>
<p>Around eight o'clock in the morning, it is the time for young masters and young ladies to take a car to school丨of course, there are also those who do not take a car. The crossroads are full of rickshaw drivers waiting to do business.</p>
<p>The stove door is especially busy in the early morning, and the girls and mothers-in-law who soak water are all standing full, waiting and chatting, and those who arrive first carry the full water bottle and wander back and forth on the street. Children chase each other in front of the door, and half a fried dough stick satisfies everything, always grinning. Children who can't walk stand at the doorway, gazing at the corner of the wall, with two snot hanging from the corners of their lips.</p>
<p>Suzhou people are really too leisurely, even the servants and children show a leisurely appearance. They all seem to be dreaming, lingering in a dream. Ah, when will the torrent of the times awaken these leisurely Suzhou people who are dreaming all day long!</p>

<h3 id="e206">Financial News: Gold Market Rises Uninterruptedly Over the Past Week <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday Rose Another 9.6 Candareens, Totaling a Rise of 16.1 Taels Over Six Days</p>
<p>(Overview) Yesterday, according to foreign dispatches, London's spot and forward gold prices remained unchanged. New York silver prices also showed no increase or decrease. Exchange rates slightly decreased, with forward silver prices down only a slight 0.8 candareens. American cotton continued to rise, increasing from 2 to 6 pounds. The gold market should have slightly declined. Although the opening price was 803 taels, the foreign exchange market also opened without clear gains or losses. Retail investors were still sellers, so the gold price first fell to 802 taels and 4 candareens. Afterwards, due to Citibank entering this month's US dollars at 8 yuan, and major players continuing to drag on transactions, prices trended higher, reaching 805 taels and 8 candareens. Later, the upward trend stopped. As the trend stabilized, retail investors took advantage of the high price to sell, causing a slight pullback. Additionally, foreign dispatches indicated that India might cancel the increased silver import tax, further dropping the price to 803 taels and 4 candareens. However, market confidence remained stable, and buyers continued to flood in, allowing the gold price to be maintained. It fluctuated around 4 taels before closing at 804 taels and 4 candareens. In the afternoon, the market was closed due to Saturday. The market situation during the half-day was stable, and there were no disturbances. The 'cooked red' (shredded gold) price had risen to around 13 taels above the standard price. Swap spreads were also high, ranging from 3.5 to 5 taels. The Central Bank had already intervened to regulate the market, buying in at 5 taels, and then selling off. Spot market openings were also few. It was rumored that Hengxing had brokered 105 bars at a price of 4 taels. The half-day market situation is recorded below.</p>
<p>(Morning Session) The morning opened at 803 taels, a slight decrease of 5 candareens from the previous close, but not significant. Merchandise spot trading had reached 0.12 taels, bolstering market confidence, leading to a pullback. Merchandise opened at 802 taels and 7 candareens. The foreign exchange market also opened stable, with the near-term British exchange rate quoted at 1 shilling, 7 pence, and 625 points, and the US exchange rate at 8 yuan, showing a slight decrease to 2 taels and 4 candareens. Major players continued to absorb supply. Hengyu took the lead, buying up to 4 taels. Merchandise was also purchased at 4.5 taels. Citibank bought this month's US dollars at 8 yuan. Fuyu came up and dragged in transactions, reaching 5 taels. Yuanchun and Hengyu continued to buy up to 5.5 taels. Dadecheng slightly sold, retreating to 4 taels and 8 candareens. Yuanmaoyong and Runchangyong both bought in, pushing the price up to 805 taels and 8 candareens. At this point, retail investors rushed to sell. Foreign dispatches indicated that India might cancel the increased silver import tax, leading to a downstream movement. Citibank sold March US dollars at 8 yuan, and Hongli also sold, dropping to around 4 taels. Yuanmaoyong bought again, raising the price by several candareens. Senchangyong suddenly sold bars, retreating to within 4 taels, at 0.26 taels. HSBC's postings were also released at this time, with no changes in British exchange or US dollars. Yuanmaoyong and Dadecheng bought bars, exceeding 4 taels. Wah Bi and HSBC bought March US dollars at 0.0625. Hengyu bought up to 4.5 taels. Fuchang and others bought in again, pushing the price to 0.055 taels. Yifeng, Yongqingfa, and Yong slightly sold off. Retail investors pushed down the price, retreating to 4 taels and 3 candareens. Yuanmaoyong and Fuyu bought up to around 5 taels. Fuchang came to buy again, reaching 5.5 taels. Afterwards, Citibank sold March US dollars at 8 yuan. Although there were no signs of loosening, it seemed the gold price had reached its peak. It then returned to within 5 taels, to 4 taels and 2 candareens. Yuanmaoyong consistently bought in, still exceeding 5 taels. Yuanheng sold bars for 4 taels. Hengxing even sold to within 4 taels. Tianfengyong sold to 0.34 taels, due to Meifeng's sale of May US dollars at 8.25 yuan. Hengxing slightly bought, gradually rising to outside 4 taels. Merchandise was also purchased, surging to 4.9 taels. Fuchang limited the price and sold, at around 4 taels. Yuanheng suddenly came to buy, pushing it to 4.6 taels. At this time, it was near the close. Retail investors, due to Hengxing's limited price sale of bars, pushed down slightly, retreating by 2 candareens to 804 taels and 4 candareens. Merchandise closed at 804 taels and 3 candareens. After the market closed, market confidence suddenly appeared agitated. Zhifengyong sold bars, retreating to within 4 taels. Fuchang also sold, dropping to within 3.5 taels, due to a lack of transactions and counterparties. The highest price during the half-day was 805 taels and 8 candareens, and the lowest price was 802 taels and 4 candareens, a fluctuation of 3.4 taels. The process was relatively stable, and the result was a continued rise of 9 candareens from the previous close.</p>
<p>(Official Prices) Because the US dollar posting remained unchanged, still calculated at 7.75 yuan, the alloy price was 864 taels, 8 candareens, and 6 fen. Based on the closing price, it was approximately 60 taels below the standard price, a decrease of slightly less than 1 tael from the previous close. The book price for this month was 805 taels, and the book price for March was 804 taels, with a replenishment price of 806 taels.</p>
<p>(Transactions) Transactions slightly decreased. In summary, Yuanmaoyong, Fuyu, Qingfayong, Yuanchun, Fuchang, Hengxing, Dadecheng, Runchangyong, and Wanxing all bought in. Zhifengyong, Yuanheng, Yifengyong, Zhaofengchang, Hongli, Daxingyong, and retail investors all sold off. The Dalian group bought first and then sold. The Guangdong group, Hengxing, bought over a hundred bars. Shengda's buying and selling were minimal. The total number of March contracts up to the 10th was 16,975.</p>
<p>(Chips) The chips for March were mostly held by the bulls, including Tongfeng, Hengan, Qianchang, Xiangshunli, Runchangyu, Runchangyong, and Hengxing, each holding over a thousand contracts, with Hengxing holding the largest amount, over four thousand contracts. The bears included Chunyuan, Yongdadecheng, Yuanmaoyong, and Daxingyong. Based on this, the bulls had greater power than the bears.</p>
<p>(Cooked Red) Yesterday, the market remained high. The initial opening price was calculated at 12.5 taels above the standard price, which was the result of mutual support among market participants and not formal transactions. Afterwards, buyers seemed to flood in, continuing to trade up to 13 taels before transactions occurred. Tongfengyong bought, and the silver shop sold 4 taels, with a total transaction of 280 taels.</p>
<p>(Swap) Both swaps and cooked red prices rose. February swaps for March were initially heard to be priced at around 3.5 candareens, but there were no counterparties. Afterwards, Hanhang came to buy in, and Yingfengheng sold at 3.5 candareens, a total of 35 contracts. The price gradually rose afterwards. Huiyuan sold to Tongfengheng at 4 taels, totaling 11 contracts. The bulls in the market disappeared again. Finally, the Central Bank intervened to regulate the market, selling off long positions, with Dadecheng buying at 5 taels, a total of 105 contracts. As of the 10th, there were still 1,911 February contracts remaining.</p>
<p>(Review) Looking back at the market this week, there was a strong upward trend. New records were seen daily, repeatedly pushing prices higher. This was due to the scarcity of physical supply. From the lowest price of 785 taels and 8 candareens on Monday to the highest price of 805 taels and 8 candareens on the weekend, there was a full 20 tael fluctuation. Compared to last Saturday, there was a continued increase of 16 taels and 1 candareen, raising the price by over 30 taels in this half-month.</p>

<p>Northern Merchants Buy In...Retail Investors Cover Short Positions...Market Prices Increase 丨 Yesterday, the bond market at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange suddenly improved. This was because the National League's actions showed an increasingly clear stance towards Japan, which was evidenced by the sharp drop in Japanese public bonds. The market was excited by this. In the morning, the market atmosphere was unavoidably hesitant. Demobilization and the 1919 customs bonds did not improve. Afterwards, the demand from various groups suddenly increased, and market prices gradually rose, rebounding by 0.2 to 0.7 jiao. In the second round, retail investors covered short positions, and the trading floor further fueled the trend, with market prices rising by several more jiao. Among them, apart from scattered retail investors, the No. 5 group was more aggressive in buying, while the No. 11 group sold more, but there were no bulk transactions. In the afternoon, the No. 11 group continued to sell, but there were few buyers, so the price slightly retreated by 0.2 to 0.3 jiao. At the close, the Northern merchant group bought more, and retail short covering was also active. Market prices gradually rose again. The market seemed quite good. As a result, prices unanimously rebounded by 0.6 to 0.7 jiao, to over 1 yuan. Among them, the 20th customs bond and the 20th-issue rolled bonds had the largest increase of 1.2 yuan. The majority of the others increased by 0.7 to 0.8 jiao. However, the 18th customs bond showed no fluctuations. The spot consolidated tax bonds fell by 0.95 jiao, due to the lack of recent trading. The number of transactions was average, with spot transactions totaling 14,000 yuan, and futures for consolidated salt tax bonds accounting for over 2 million, and the remaining each accounting for 0.3 to 0.5 million, totaling 5,259,000 yuan. At this critical juncture in diplomacy, the bond market still faces many uncertainties. However, the number of remaining accounts is not very large.</p>

<p>A report from Xinfeng Foreign Company stated that the New York stock market turned weak again on Friday. The unfilled orders for US Steel Corporation in January created a new low record of 1,898,644 tons, compared to 2,648,150 tons in the same period last year. Market confidence was weak, and the market situation was consequently weak. However, railroad stocks slightly rebounded before the close. The total number of shares traded throughout the day was 720,000. US Telephone and Telegraph Company released its 1932 report, showing a profit of 7.82 yuan per share, compared to 9.05 yuan last year. The current dividend is 9 yuan per share annually. The company will hold a board meeting next Wednesday to discuss this dividend issue. The outcome is difficult to predict. In addition, Monday (the 13th) is Lincoln's birthday, and the New York Stock Exchange will be closed for one day. The Dow Jones index is listed below:</p>

<p>The yarn market is weak, and the downward trend is gradually intensifying. The physical yarn business is stagnant, and there is no activity from various parties. Due to economic difficulties, purchasing power is weakening, and market confidence is showing uneasiness. However, the majority of the mentality is that, due to the weak base, pulling tight distant months, they are unwilling to loosen. However, judging from the overall trend, it is extremely unfavorable. According to a survey by a certain cotton industry organization, Shanghai's yarn inventory at the end of January was around 120,000 to 130,000 bales.</p>
<h3 id="e215">Marked Yarn Falls by 0.05 to 0.07 Yuan <a href="#e215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>The marked yarn market opened in the morning with a slight increase of 0.02, 0.03, and 0.04 yuan due to the rebound in foreign cotton and short covering. In the afternoon, it was reported that actual demand was sluggish, and selling pressure rose again. The market situation suddenly weakened, with each month falling by 0.07, 0.08, and 0.09 yuan. The total number of transactions for the day was 17,100 bales. It was found that Hengyi sold 1,250 bales, Changfeng sold 850 bales, Dafeng sold 800 bales, Renfeng sold 550 bales, and Yongda sold 550 bales. Mingde bought 2,150 bales, Dafu bought 400 bales, Jifeng bought 400 bales, and Yichang bought 500 bales. The closing prices are as follows:</p>
<p>Marked Yarn Closing Prices Fluctuation Open Positions May 14.47 Down 0.06 29,900 February 14.17 Down 0.05 33,950 June 14.54 0.04 18,150 March 14.26 0.05 47,600 July 14.57 0.07 7,200 April 14.38 0.05 41,600 Total 178,400</p>

<p>It was found that the total number of bales bought by various groups throughout the day was only 252, and the market price fell by about 0.05 yuan. However, the price of 42-count thread fell by 0.03 to 0.04 taels. The amount bought by each group is as follows:</p>

<p>The cotton market initially rose and then fell, but the trend remained flat. Due to the poor yarn market, cotton inventories from various sources remained untouched. Last year, most cotton merchants absorbed the high prices in anticipation, but this year, Indian cotton has fallen sharply, and the world cotton market is in a state of surplus. Factories are cautious about buying high-priced cotton. However, those holding goods are still unwilling to loosen. If foreign cotton continues to arrive, there will be a drastic change in domestic cotton prices.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the US cotton market was initially firm due to a good cloth market and active buying. Later, it softened due to some long positions being liquidated. Futures prices increased by 0.02 to 0.06 pounds, while spot prices remained unchanged. British cotton futures increased by 2-3 points, and spot prices increased by 13 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices increased by 16 points. Indian cotton initially rose with US cotton, but then weakened due to selling by Japanese merchants and brokers.

<p>However, Most News About Cotton Fields May Need To Be Increased 丨 A New York dispatch on the 10th reported on the cotton market during the week, stating that at the beginning of last week, a storm occurred at the Gibbon Bank in New Orleans, which caused long positions to be liquidated and further accelerated. However, the storm at the bank passed peacefully afterwards, so short covering and re-buying followed. The demand for cotton cloth was better, and the news about farmland relief from Washington was also good, so buying interest was also encouraged. Recently, the climate has been quite unfavorable for the arrangement of farmland and the sale of primary cotton fertilizer. In the 13 southern states, January increased by 20% compared to the same period last year. Some experts believe that the low temperature in the western cotton belt is sufficient to restrain the larvae of boll weevils. The clearing of cotton fields has generally increased. However, this view still depends on the future market conditions and the agricultural crop production debt rules announced by the Ministry of Agriculture.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the sugar market's benchmark price remained stable. However, today being Sunday with no shipments, transactions were extremely scarce. The guild's listed price for grade 24 coarse granulated white sugar was still 15 taels and 7 qian, but no deal was made. Grade 18 medium granulated white sugar was at 15 taels and 3 qian, grade 20 medium granulated white sugar was at 15 taels and 4 qian. Grades 8 and 9/10 of Dutch red sugar were at 12 taels 3 qian to 2 qian and 12 taels 4 qian 5 qian, respectively, with few takers. Taikoo’s B mark granulated white sugar was at 16 taels and a half, CW at 16 taels and 3 qian, DY mark at 16 taels, and HX mark at 15 taels and 9 qian, with minimal fluctuations. It's noted that the ground price of grade 24 coarse granulated white sugar has indeed seen a rebound, but sales here are sluggish, remaining flat. Furthermore, the previously listed price for goods at the Taixiang Road has decreased slightly by 2.5 fen, and the future market is feared to be difficult to rise too high.

<h3 id="e228">Northern Goods: Orchid Bamboo Shoots Still Lacking Improvement <a href="#e228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>Arrivals of orchid bamboo shoots have been scarce recently. Although the price of the smallest-sized lot at 16 taels before the major settlement seems cheap, sales have not improved. Therefore, since the beginning of spring, besides some sales by traders, no lots have been sold so far. Buyers seem unwilling to purchase unless the price is very low. Thus, merchants are taking a wait-and-see approach, waiting for sales to pick up before they are willing to sell.</p>
<p>Business Tips (8)</p>
<h3 id="e229">Selecting Wood Ear: Thin Slices, Large Fruiting Bodies, Low Price <a href="#e229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>"Wood ear" is a type of fungus, cool in nature, produced in Sichuan and other places. It grows on trees and resembles an ear in shape, hence the name "wood ear." High-grade varieties, such as Sichuan ear, Malanping ear, and Yan ear, have standard characteristics: they are dark and glossy, have large and abundant fruiting bodies, thin slices, light texture, and few impurities. Second-grade varieties, such as HeKou ear, GuCheng ear, YiChang ear, and XingAn ear, are generally similar in quality, but differ in that they have fewer large fruiting bodies, a duller color, or heavier impurities. HeKou ear, in particular, tends to have thicker slices. The lowest grade includes NanZhang ear and YangPing ear, which are characterized by thick and heavy slices, and many impurities. YangPing ear is even more likely to contain mud and sand, making it the lowest quality wood ear.</p>
<p>"Uses": Mostly used as a side dish, but its cool and moisturizing nature can nourish yin. Although not as good as white fungus, regular consumption has similar benefits.</p>
<p>"Preparation": Soak in water until fully rehydrated, remove the edges, and use only the base of the ear. Wash thoroughly and simmer in water until tender, then add rock sugar to taste. This is a unique dish that is comparable to silver fungus.</p>
<p>"Medicinal Use": Charred into ash and ground into a powder, taken with a light salt water solution, it can treat stomach ailments.</p>

<h3 id="e253">The Southward Migration of Culture <a href="#e253" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c253" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">253</a></h3>
<p>— Zhan Lu</p>
<p>Beiping, doesn't it bear the honor of being a city of culture? Once the highly anticipated southward migration of cultural relics is implemented, won't the city of culture be merely superficial? Because of this question, waves of opposition are surging. In fact, the southward migration of culture is not something to oppose. I am moved by the southward migration of culture from Beiping to reflect on the lack of a southward migration of military strength from the three northeastern provinces! It's a pity that it didn't happen! To put it elegantly, "Is it the fortune of culture or the misfortune of military strength?"</p>
<p>If the Northeastern authorities had cherished military strength as they cherish culture today, before the September 18th Incident, they would have moved all military-related airplanes, guns, bullets, and equipment to the south in large quantities. That would have increased the anti-Japanese forces during the January 28th Incident, causing greater wounds to the enemy.</p>
<p>Since the military strength of the past did not migrate south, the culture of the present must migrate south as soon as possible. Northern scholars naturally disregard the southward migration of culture, while southern scholars shout slogans of unparalleled glory for the southward migration of culture.</p>
<p>Where does the glory lie? The glory lies in the fact that in this era of "literary works being worthless in times of chaos," society is actually changing its martial habits and becoming right-oriented in spirit! Aren't literary figures about to rise? The military strength of the past was not worth migrating south, but only the culture of Beiping, only the Palace Museum culture of Beiping, is worth migrating. Who says the world is not at peace? Emphasizing literature and de-emphasizing military strength is a symbol of peace! Southern archaeologists, epigraphers, artists, and all gentlemen holding pens will surely enthusiastically shout slogans for the once-in-a-millennium southward migration of culture!</p>
<p>The southward migration of culture is even more glorious than what Song scholars called "the southward journey of our Dao."</p>
<h3 id="e254">International Tycoons <a href="#e254" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c254" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">254</a></h3>
<p>— Bai He</p>
<p>| Seeking Opportunities, Taking Advantage</p>
<p>Shanghai has many idle people, tycoons, who loiter on the streets all day long. When they see a country bumpkin wearing nailed shoes and carrying an umbrella, walking along looking around, they immediately size him up. Then, they deliberately bump into the bumpkin. This behavior is called "seeking opportunities" by the tycoons. After "seeking opportunities," they scold, "Stupid pig, didn't bring your eyes (棗子) with you? Why did you bump into me?" Then, they immediately deliver two slaps. As a result, the country bumpkin digs out silver dollars from his pocket to pay his respects to the tycoon, and also has to apologize a hundred and twenty times before the tycoon deigns to spare him, wearing his hat askew and muttering, "Stupid pig, consider yourself lucky, next time be more careful when you walk." The Northeast Incident in our country is just like a country bumpkin meeting a Shanghai tycoon. Look, who exactly blew up the South Manchurian Railway on September 18th? It's obvious, it was "seeking opportunities." Then came the warning, which is clearly like someone bumping into another person and then scolding them, "Stupid pig... Why did you bump into me?" After the warning, military action was launched immediately, without waiting for negotiations, just like the Shanghai tycoon slapping the country bumpkin twice before he could even argue. It's a pity that our China, without a doubt, is acting like a country bumpkin who, after being slapped twice, silently gives up everything in his pocket. It's a pity that we haven't apologized a hundred and twenty times yet, and the tycoon still thinks we're "not being cooperative." Otherwise, the tycoon would have already walked away wearing his hat askew, and perhaps the Battle of Rehe wouldn't have happened.</p>
<p>Soviet Foreign Minister Maxim Litvinov, at the Geneva Disarmament Conference, advocated defining aggression and refuted the various absurd reasons for carrying out aggression in a reasonable and logical manner. His concluding remarks said, "If war is regarded as a way to ensure peace, then there will never be an aggressor in armed conflicts." The country bumpkin listened to these words with great interest. But I wonder, what do the international tycoons think?</p>
<h3 id="e255">The Three Loves Doctrine <a href="#e255" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c255" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">255</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Yinong</p>
<p>| The Trilogy of Life |</p>
<p>We all know that our President Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People for saving the country and the people were developed from Lincoln's speech (Of the people, by the people, for the people). Now, I have also derived the Three Loves Doctrine from the English "from love in love with love," which is a true portrayal of life. Its meaning is to be born out of self-love, to live with love, and to die for love. Let me illustrate it below.</p>
<p>This is what the Bible says for sure: After Adam and Eve stole the apple in God's orchard, they understood unprecedented love, and loved everything. Alas, the failure or success of love ultimately comes down to death!</p>
<p>To be born out of self-love, to live with love, and to die for love is called the trilogy of life. Who says it's not appropriate?</p>

<p>| A Masterpiece of Pseudo-Moralists |</p>
<p>During my time as a news reporter, there was hardly a day when I didn't go to the Public Security Bureau to investigate social discoveries. What I can't forget the most is the pair of young men and women found near the City God Temple. I am most dissatisfied with the social news that has always flowed into the lower-level vulgar tastes of consciousness, I can not publish it, in my observation, it is really not considered "news."</p>
<p>It was a summer evening: A man was wearing a red and white striped undershirt that reached his belly; below, he wore a pair of white shorts with blue trim, revealing his hairy legs without the protection of woolen socks. It looked like an athlete's outfit. His companion, a young lady, was wearing a red thin silk cheongsam, covered with the most popular new-style coat with a high collar. The two of them walked in shoulder to shoulder from the New North Gate. Who knew that they would immediately be surrounded by hooligans on the street, gathering more and more people, causing bystanders to shout curiously:</p>
<p>"Look! Everyone look, this pair of weirdos..." Then the voices became mixed and loud, and heads floated in the shouts like melons in a field. As a result, due to disrupting public order, the police officers politely asked them to go to the Public Security Bureau. The police chief said to me, "Strange and gaudy clothes promote licentiousness, they deserve it." And he wanted me to publish this matter in the newspaper. I smiled without saying anything. How could I regard this as "news"!</p>

<h3 id="e257">The Adventures of Mixed-River Dragon <a href="#e257" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c257" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">257</a></h3>
<p>— Huo Xueming</p>
<p>The moon is very bright, it is a winter night; there is not a single star, and the celestial body flows with clear blue light.</p>
<p>The old parasol trees, more than ten feet high, lined up on the bank, sparsely covered with a few black and scorched remnant leaves, mocked by the whispering, chilly night wind. Various weeds on the verge of death, lying low at the foot of the trees, also sent out piteous tones like light, secluded sobs. The official road wore a dry face; the soil also cracked; a white strip, like a silver snake, but because of the branches and leaves blown by the wind on it, it painted on its body with a vivid and endless strange riddle-like artistic conception.</p>
<p>In short, it was a winter night that froze the world. The men and women in wealthy families were all chatting around the stove.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a faint shadow swayed on the official road, flitting like a wandering soul, but gradually the shadow deepened and darkened, and the sound of coughing could be heard, but it was very light, followed by the sound of footsteps. The sounds of insects nearby seemed afraid of being discovered; they stopped completely. Here, there were only the sounds of wind and leaves, the sounds of footsteps, and occasionally the dry cough of an old man.</p>
<p>In the moonlight, Mixed-River Dragon Li Si was immediately discovered. His owl-like, shining pair of small eyes were pressed under the brim of his old felt hat, vaguely searching for the way. His neck was shrunk between his two towering shoulder blades, as if afraid of the cold. Yes, thick green snot was clearly flowing under his wine-red nose.</p>
<p>He walked very fast, although it was unusually laborious. The fishing net on his back, the harpoon tightly held in his hand, and the fish basket slung around his waist, made him look like the most savage type of professional in the countryside.</p>
<p>"Damn, that shrew, she's ruined my whole life!" He was fed up, squinting his eyes and spitting out a slight curse. Then he clenched his teeth, breathed out a cold breath, and continued to walk north along the official road. In his mind, he imagined the memories of his wife having an affair with someone else, repeatedly quarreling with him, and then running away. (I)</p>
<p>Plant the seeds of love, and when the melons are ripe and fall, a group of human children and grandchildren will be produced. In other words, the source of mankind is the crystallization of their love.</p>
<p>Since we planted the roots of love before we were born, we will naturally not be able to jump out of the hands of the god of love after we become adults. Therefore, as soon as men and women reach the age of sixteen or seventeen, they will understand what love is without being taught, and they will also be very good at practicing it, and they will even shout "Sweetheart" "Dear" Thus, love heaven and love earth, living in the hands of the god of love,</p>
<p>If love succeeds, what will happen? Of course, they will be happy to death! If love fails, what will happen? Of course, their hearts will ache to death! Therefore, they either swallow sleeping pills or jump into the Huangpu River to seek relief.</p>

<p>Tomorrow I appreciated a basketball game between a boys' middle school and a girls' normal school on the basketball court. On both sides of the grid, blue and black vests were jumping, and red and white shorts were also active. The arms and fat legs of the men and women naturally danced so naked, attracting the attention of tens of thousands of eyes. However, the costumes of the players on this ball court are more dazzling and more gorgeous than the lovers found in the City God Temple; by analogy, it seems that moralists should scold "hindering public morals." But in the end, I have not seen an order from the Public Security Bureau prohibiting ball games.</p>
<p>Ordinary women are said to be seductive when they bare their legs and wrists, while female athletes are praised for "showing physical health." In fact, these contradictions are just errors in the understanding of pseudo-moralists.</p>

<p>— Bing Yu</p>
<p>In ancient times, there was a pair of pigs lying side by side in the wilderness near a village. An old eagle flew from the sky. The eagle's stomach was very hungry, and seeing two fat pigs below, it wanted to seize them in one fell swoop. He soared in the air for a while, suddenly opened his claws and looked down, grabbing fiercely at the backs of the two pigs. His left claw pierced into the back flesh of the male pig, and his right claw pierced into the back flesh of the female pig. The two pigs were both awakened and felt extremely painful on their backs, and they ran wildly and rampaged desperately. At this time, the eagle's two claws were both pierced into the backs of the two pigs and could not be pulled out, so it was split in two at the feet by the two pigs and died. Therefore, there is an old saying from ancient times: "The hungry eagle died with its legs split," which is used to compare the meaning of dying because of excessive greed. There are indeed many people in today's society who are as greedy as hungry eagles, resulting in their deaths!</p>

<p>— Miao Shen</p>
<p>Goldfish are the kind of fish that are good to look at but not good to eat. In Lanxi, Zhejiang, there is a story about goldfish: It is said that there used to be a family with only a mother and daughter, lonely and helpless, struggling to make a living. The daughter was born very filial, and went out to do some small business every day, earning some meager interest to support her old mother; but she herself was often hungry because her income was not enough for the two of them to eat, and she did not dare to tell her mother. Once in winter, just as heavy snow was falling, she went out to do her business as usual, braving the snow, but she knew that she had shouted all day and there was not a single customer. For several days in a row, the old mother groaned in bed with hunger, and she was so anxious that she just cried. She had a subconscious impulse, begging for the compassion of Heaven, and she also thought about going to the stream behind her house to catch a few fish to fill her stomach. She cried sadly, dripping bright red tears, and staggered to the stream behind her house. But she knew that at this time her filial piety had moved Heaven, and countless golden little fish fell into the stream. When she arrived at the stream, she saw schools of fish, shimmering with golden scales, and she was very surprised; where in the world had there ever been such fish? She fished out a few, but she knew that the fish died as soon as they left the water, and even more strangely, the golden little fish had become lumps of gold! She was happy and astonished, thinking that it must be divine help. She ran to tell her mother, and turned back to turn the gold into rice. After that, her family gradually became a prosperous family because of the goldfish in this stream. Unexpectedly, they later leaked this matter to the outside world, and people from far and near came to snatch the goldfish. The strong beat the weak, and the young killed the old. At this time, Heaven knew again, probably using some immortal magic, from then on, the fish in the water were goldfish, and on the shore they were still goldfish, but the gold color of these goldfish could not be sold like gold.</p>

<p>Miss L once sat on the table wearing shorts, her trousers rolled up, completely exposing one leg of white flesh. Her friend T warned her:</p>
<p>"Hey! What do you look like?"</p>
<p>L understood the meaning of these words, and she pulled a face and said:</p>
<p>"Why do you put your hand outside? Isn't it just a piece of meat like my leg!"</p>
<p>Everyone was silent. A kind of worldly pseudo-moral observation is really ridiculous. During the day, they really say "etiquette is strict," and at night? I don't believe they don't secretly grope with their wives.</p>

<h3 id="e262">To Have Peace in the World, Everyone Must Have Food to Eat <a href="#e262" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c262" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">262</a></h3>
<p>— Han Dehui</p>
<p>The Amateur Weekly, at the expense of its precious space, has specially opened a "Self-Employment Introduction" column for the unemployed. This enthusiasm is already worthy of our admiration; and the editor often gives up the position of "Editor's Surplus" to publish many free advertisements introducing occupations, which is even more touching!</p>
<p>In these free advertisements, we see many job seekers. Some who have served as editors and teachers are now willing to take the position of a chauffeur; some who are proficient in handling books and bookkeeping are now willing to serve as a tea room worker or errand boy; there are even university students who do not care about salary and sell themselves at any price. To these poor friends, in addition to expressing "sympathy for each other" and my own feeling of "fellow sufferers," I also feel that I myself am now in a small occupation and have not been squeezed into the ranks of the unemployed and gone to the hunger line, so I cannot help but shout "Lucky!", || although my current small occupation can only be called half-hungry and half-full.</p>
<p>"Unemployment" is indeed a very serious problem in our China, no, the whole world today. If this serious problem is not properly resolved and allowed to become more and more serious day by day, I don't know what a tragic result it will lead to in the future!</p>
<p>Although I am deeply indignant for the poor friends who are unemployed and have no food to eat, I am also deeply worried for the old masters, ladies, young masters, and young ladies who live in luxury and extravagance. If you really force them to be unable to survive and let them starve to death, they will never let you have a good time at that time; because they also have the right to survive in this world!</p>
<p>Even if one person is in distress, the whole table will be unhappy; can you not be moved when you see so many of the same kind, with the same round heads and square feet, suffering hardship and on the verge of death!</p>
<p>In my opinion, for the sake of self-interest and the benefit of others, you should not ignore this serious problem of "unemployment." Everyone should work hard day and night to find a proper solution as soon as possible!</p>
<p>To have peace in the world, everyone must have food to eat. Although we cannot reach the ideal of sharing blessings together for the time being, at the very least, we cannot allow there to be an unemployed person in the world, that is to say, we cannot allow there to be a hungry person in the world.</p>

<p>— Zong Wen</p>
<p>It is strange that female workers account for more than half of the workers in so many factories in Shanghai. This is not necessarily a bad phenomenon. Who says that women's careers in society are not developed? The wages of male workers are already low enough, but the wages of female workers are about a dime less than those of male workers, so that they cannot even get enough to eat after working hard all day long. As for working hours, some are as long as fourteen hours. The first steam pipe rings at five o'clock every morning, and they get up to eat breakfast; the second steam pipe rings at half past five, and the factory gate opens, and they enter the factory; the third steam pipe rings at six o'clock, and the factory gate closes, and they start work: they take a one-hour break at twelve o'clock for lunch: they go back to work at one o'clock in the afternoon, and do not stop until five or six o'clock in the evening. In the yarn factory, the machines run day and night. In addition, there are night shifts. Although night shifts have extra wages, many female workers often do it to exhaustion and die from overwork in order to get more wages. This is really a terrible thing!</p>
<p>The rules of the factory are very strict. The foremen are all like wolves and tigers, domineering and doing whatever they want: they often beat and scold the workers unreasonably, deduct their wages, or even fire them; what is especially hateful is that they arbitrarily check the workers at the factory gate when they leave work, simply playing with them for pleasure.</p>
<p>When they come home from work every day, they also have to cook and prepare meals, raise sons and daughters, and wash the whole family's clothes. 365 days a year, they simply have no time to rest except for a few hours of sleep. So their suffering is even greater than that of male workers.</p>
<p>Women have a natural love for beauty, but the female workers are limited by economics and cannot get full development, and because of economic oppression, many female workers often fall and engage in prostitution as well.</p>
<p>Alas! The lives of female workers are really too pitiful! How should it be improved? I hope that all the readers of this journal will discuss it together.</p>

<p>— Destroyed Respect</p>
<p>『Old B! Old B!』</p>
<p>A, lying in bed, seemed to hear the rain falling, and felt troubled in his stomach, calling out to B, who was sleeping on the bed opposite him.</p>
<p>Although B was awakened by A’s call, he was too lazy to speak, only shifting his body slightly in the bed.</p>
<p>『Old B! Listen! It sounds like it’s raining!』 A called out again.</p>
<p>『Really?』 B suddenly poked his head out and, after listening carefully, said, 『My goodness! It’s really raining hard!』</p>
<p>『Damn! Damn!』 A and B sighed in unison.</p>
<p>A and B were both small employees in the company, receiving meager salaries and living a life that was neither rich nor poor, a precarious existence for the petty bourgeoisie.</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>They sighed when they heard the rain. There was a reason for this.</p>
<p>A often divided their monthly life into four eras, much like historians divide past historical facts into different periods. This was based on his own economic principles.</p>
<p>A said: The first week after receiving his salary is called the “Silver Dollar Era,” because during this era, payments for meals, rent, debt, and sometimes even buying a pair of shoes are all made with silver dollars. That's why it's called the "Silver Dollar Era." In the second week, although there aren't many silver dollars left, they're converted into dimes, and there are still a few. Buying two chocolate bars or taking a rickshaw twice allows one to feel a little comfortable. The spending is mostly in dimes. By the third week, only copper coins are used. At most, one might spend a hundred copper coins to buy some roasted chestnuts. During this "Copper Coin Era," one can still scrape by. But by the fourth week, the wallet is empty. Even the tram fare is difficult to come by, so one has to "eat tomorrow's rations today," borrowing from here and there. This "Eating Tomorrow's Rations" era is quite miserable.</p>
<p>『Damn! In this "Eating Tomorrow's Rations" era when we don’t even have tram fare, Heaven still has to rain!』 A shouted bitterly in bed.</p>
<p>·····························</p>
<p>Time passed silently, still passing, passing, passing. The small hand of the clock pointed straight at eight o’clock. The sound of wind and rain was particularly loud, penetrating through the window lattice. A and B had no choice but to get up.</p>
<p>Fifteen minutes later, A and B, wearing galoshes and desperately holding umbrellas, walked with great difficulty through a fierce wind and rain. Although the lower part of their robes was already wet, they still struggled to run towards the Bund.</p>
<p>Life as a Messenger</p>
<h3 id="e265">A Special Class Among Servants <a href="#e265" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c265" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">265</a></h3>
<p>— Shi Bin</p>
<p>Being a messenger is a special class among servants. Their duties involve both internal and external affairs. They have to deliver letters and organize all the miscellaneous tasks in the company. This would seem to indicate that their lives are very busy. In fact, most messengers have an easier life than those friends who bury themselves in paperwork all day long. When there are letters to deliver, they go out for a run, and when they come back, they do some cleaning. During their free time, they gather together and engage in lively discussions. Their lives are much more relaxed than ours, sitting at a desk all day, becoming as silent as cicadas when we see Western bosses. Even in terms of salary, some clerks earn less than they do.</p>
<p>There is no fixed standard for messengers' salaries. Generally, it is determined by the number of years of service. Some messengers who have worked for more than ten years earn around one hundred yuan. This amount is certainly not large compared to the income of the average merchant, but we must understand that their income does not rely entirely on a fixed salary. What they value most is the extra income. Sometimes the extra income can even exceed the fixed salary. For example, during lunar festivals, the festival bonuses given by the clerks in large offices or companies can sometimes amount to seventy or eighty yuan per messenger, making them much happier than those friends who are desperate at every festival. Even in ordinary times, many import and export merchants distribute extra income at the end of each month, and messengers are also included in the distribution.</p>
<p>In addition to the above two sources of income, messengers who are good at making money sometimes also engage in other businesses, such as selling sweets or snacks, and in the summer, they sell soda or "Beauty" brand ice cream, catering to the needs of the clerks. This is also a great way to make money.</p>
<p>The life of a messenger is indeed carefree, but sometimes it is also risky. For example, some old messengers with established credit often have to carry thousands of silver dollars to the bank for deposit or withdrawal. A moment of carelessness can easily lead to problems. Fortunately, their simple clothing does not attract the attention of criminals, otherwise, they would suffer.</p>
<p>Messengers are also known as "coolies," and sometimes they are called "boys." But both of these terms are not very accurate. Think about it, although they are laborers, they are not as hardworking as porters. As for "boy," it is the general term used by Westerners for all servants. But if you think about it carefully, messengers are at least thirty years old, which is not qualified to be called "boy," while the "boy" referred to by Westerners refers to general younger trainees or waiters in bars.</p>

<p>"Do not laugh at the farmer's cloudy rice wine,</p>
<p>A bountiful year leaves guests satisfied with chicken and pork."</p>
<p>丨Lu Fangweng</p>
<p>Indeed, everyone can easily achieve sufficient food and clothing, drink enough old wine, say a few sarcastic remarks, and write a few boring poems. Accommodate guests? Rice wine? Chicken and pork? To be honest, with the rural economy completely ruined today, the reality tells us that these are long impossible. Like my uncle in the countryside used to brew yellow wine every year, but in recent years, even the jar for yellow wine is nowhere to be found. Strange? I asked him why he didn't make yellow wine these years, he didn't say anything, just sighed:</p>
<p>"Brewing wine? It's not easy! Where does the rice come from? The harvest from the fields is not enough for our own family to eat. In good years, an average of four dan of grain is harvested per mu, but in bad years, even two or one dan cannot be harvested. Even with the current cheap rice price, each hu only sells for four or five yuan, and we still have to deduct the landlord's rent, soybean cake money, and various land taxes and household taxes... One mu can only be sold for more than ten yuan. Think about it, after deducting so much money, is there any room for profit? I am sixty years old this year and have never seen such a pressing situation as in recent years. When I was young, a pig's head at the butcher's only sold for more than two hundred wen, and the rent was only seven hundred wen per mu. If one was unfortunately ill, hiring a doctor only cost one or two hundred wen. The standard of living was so low, but by the end of the year, many families still couldn't make ends meet! Borrowing money, repaying debts, pawning clothes... In recent years, alas! Even more so..."</p>
<p>The elderly uncle certainly wouldn't tell me any lies. Look, how declining is the current rural situation! Accommodate guests? I ask, what can they use to accommodate them?</p>
<p>The aggression and oppression of the great powers, the endless civil wars of the warlords, the capitalists ruthlessly exploiting the blood and sweat of a group of pitiful workers, the corrupt officials greedily scraping the fat off countless impoverished farmers, everything, everything is about to end the lives of the working masses!</p>
<p>Mencius said: "If the kitchen is full of fat meat, and the stable is full of fat horses, but the people have a hungry look, and the fields are full of starving corpses, this is leading beasts to devour men!" This is a good portrayal of the current society.</p>

<h3 id="e267">On the Road to Baiquan <a href="#e267" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c267" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">267</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Chanmo</p>
<p>At this time, it was about four o'clock in the afternoon. Lead-colored dark clouds filled the sky. Snowflakes were rolled into balls by the roaring northwest wind and fell down. The ground was almost a foot thick. The road to Baiquan was all white. Not to mention seeing any people, there wasn't even a single bird or beast. However, in a large forest, not far from the main road in the middle, there seemed to be more than three hundred people dressed in white scattered on both sides, each with a very anxious look on their faces, as if they had made an appointment with friends, and the friends hadn't arrived after the appointed time, and they were feeling anxious.</p>
<p>"It's getting late, why haven't they come yet? Could it be that the reporter got the date wrong?"</p>
<p>"That's right? We received orders yesterday afternoon to come here and ambush. It was said that today, at the latest by lunchtime, those shorties would be here. Why haven't they come yet?"</p>
<p>"Could it be that the shorties already know?"</p>
<p>"Impossible, right? Look, there's so much snow, there's not a single trace on the road, and the planes haven't come to scout either, how would they know we're waiting for them here?"</p>
<p>"This is really strange. The road to Baiquan has to go through here. Otherwise, the reporter must have made a mistake."</p>
<p>"Stop arguing, listen, what's that sound?"</p>
<p>"It doesn't sound like a plane, it must be a truck carrying pigs!"</p>
<p>"That's right, these shorties must have come after eating their fill, planning to go to Baiquan tonight and fight us..."</p>
<p>The sound of the truck moving on the snow, cha...cha...cha..., and the vibration of the motor mixed with the northwest wind, were carried over from afar. These brothers perked up their ears like hunting dogs and listened. Sure enough, the sound was getting closer and closer. The hot blood in everyone's veins was immediately ignited by the excitement of killing the enemy, and their eyes sparkled with brave and joyful light. They exchanged knowing smiles. On the order, the brothers on both sides prepared their weapons, waiting for the enemy to come and die.</p>
<p>Five trucks and two armored vehicles entered the forest, tail to tail like a long snake. On the five trucks, there were about thirty Japanese soldiers on average per vehicle, all with their necks shrunk, chattering and laughing. The first armored vehicle led the way into the forest. After only a short distance, the last armored vehicle was also within the firing line of the brothers ambushing on both sides. The brothers all had their fingers on the triggers, thinking that whoever's bullet flew out first would determine the fate of those things. However, they were still waiting, waiting, waiting for the commander's order - waiting for the first mortar shell to fire, which would be their chance.</p>
<p>The vehicles had already reached the area completely surrounded by the brothers. The first armored vehicle fell into the hole that they had dug in advance. At that moment, a deafening sound broke the silence on the road to Baiquan. A shell flew onto the armored vehicle and destroyed the engine. Before the enemy could retaliate, another shell flew from the right and blew away all the objects in front of the vehicle.</p>
<p>Caught in this unexpected attack, the enemy panicked and scrambled to grab their guns and set up their machine guns. As they jumped out of the vehicles and scattered around them to fight back, forty or fifty of the enemy had already had their bodies become the permanent resting place for lead bullets. The targets of our four mortars were all on those seven vehicles, so except for the machine guns on the two armored vehicles still firing in all directions, the five trucks were completely destroyed.</p>
<p>After this mutual bombardment for a long time, night had fallen, and specks of fire sparkled in the darkness. The smell of sulfur choked everyone. The machine guns on the two armored vehicles could not withstand the concentrated artillery fire and were soon destroyed. Following this, the enemy's firepower was not as strong as before. On the commander's order to charge, the brothers flanked from both sides. Rain-like lead bullets were fired densely towards the enemy, and the magnificent shouts of killing shook the snowy night like thunder...</p>
<p>The enemy didn't know how many of our brothers there were, only feeling that bullets were flying from all directions. In the beginning, before the machine guns on the two armored vehicles were destroyed, although they were afraid, they still hoped that the armored vehicles could charge forward and open a bloody path. But after the machine guns on the armored vehicles stopped firing, they were completely disappointed and knew that today the chance of death was greater than the hope of survival. When our brothers charged, the enemy, half of whom were already dead, struggled under a barrage of intense fire for a while. Suddenly, the bullets from the opposite side stopped flying over. They only heard a chaotic and rapid sound of footsteps on the snow. They saw the flashing broadswords reflecting the snow and emitting a cold light. So the enemy's machine guns and rifles all stepped up their firing, hoping to repel the brothers who were charging over. Our brothers fell in one row, and immediately another row filled in, wielding broadswords and holding grenades. Row after row, they stepped over the corpses of their own brothers and charged forward. Some of the enemy's machine guns were destroyed by grenades, and some were seized by the brothers, who turned the muzzles and swept them at the enemy. The flashing light of the swords splashed the blood of the Yamato spirit and sprinkled it on the white snow, a strange and bright color...</p>
<p>The sound of gunfire gradually thinned out... and finally stopped completely. While rescuing the wounded brothers, a smug smile appeared on the face of each brother.</p>
<p>Snowflakes were still rolled into balls by the roaring northwest wind and fell down. On the road to Baiquan, a team of more than two hundred people was walking, trampling on the snow, cha...cha...cha.......</p>

<p>— Lin</p>
<p>The owner of a store, because business was slow, had to engage in a large-scale sale, and advertised with a big sign saying "Buy One Get One Free," hoping that the goods in his store would be sold immediately.</p>
<p>I have always worked in administrative agencies, serving in "As Directed" and "Similar Reasons" positions. I have served as a section chief and director for ten years. I believe that my strengths lie in being responsible and having quick writing skills. I also have experience in handling official documents. Now, because business is slow, I have decided to imitate the store's method and borrow space in this column to post an advertisement (fortunately, there is no advertising fee), implementing "Buy One Get Two Free," which is even cheaper than the store.</p>
<p>As for the "Buy One Get Two Free" method, my previous job paid at least one hundred yuan per month. Now, as long as I receive more than thirty yuan, I can take on six or seven hours of work a day. If the time is reduced, I am willing to reduce the compensation accordingly. All can be discussed in person. My agency is located in the editorial department of this publication. Please buy quickly! Buyers can be from any organization or store, but those in other cities must add a reasonable compensation. All kinds of certificates are complete and can be verified during contact.</p>

<p>— Yang</p>
<p>From foreign news, we know that in European and American countries, regardless of politics and society, they are exhausting their wisdom to seek methods of relief for unemployed workers. The failure to satisfactorily resolve this issue can cause high-ranking officials to worry and the entire government to collapse. In our China today, this can only be told as a joke, and it is even more unnecessary to talk about it for other unemployed people.</p>
<p>I should first thank the editor of this publication, who can actually focus on the suffering of us unemployed people and is willing to set aside some valuable space to provide us with self-employment opportunities. Although I haven't gotten a good job yet, I first want to bless our editor!</p>
<p>Since the Japanese cannons of January 28th bombed away my only property and also bombed away my job, or rather, it can be said that I lost it myself. At that time, I was working in the Japanese-owned Shen Heng Foreign Firm on Jiangxi Road in this city, managing all the accounts. After the cannon fire of January 28th sounded, I felt that it was too heartless to be friends with the enemy again and to help the enemy as a pioneer in economic aggression. I was extremely ashamed. In order to prolong a few lives, I had lived under the enemy's fence for many years. At this time, although my family was ruined and my economy was in extreme panic, in order to fight for a little dignity for the country and fight for a little personality for the nation, I resolutely resigned from the Shen Heng Foreign Firm and was unwilling to cooperate with them anymore. Although many friends advised me to find another job before resigning, I wouldn't listen. Moreover, at that time, there were many enthusiastic patriotic organizations, such as the Shanghai Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association, willing to be the backing for us generally unemployed people due to the anti-Japanese war. They asked me to register in order to introduce me to a job, and I did so. Who knew that after the sound of the cannons of January 28th subsided, the so-called Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association gradually faded away imperceptibly. I anxiously hoped at home every day that the association could truly fulfill its promise and give me a gospel of relief. But the true five-minute enthusiasm has passed, who is still shouldering the banner of Anti-Japanese National Salvation to shout again? My hope is forever just hope. I am still sitting at home, becoming a vague unemployed person, alas! It's been more than a year!</p>
<p>I am a high school graduate and have a considerable foundation in Japanese and English. Before entering Shen Heng, I also worked in a certain foreign firm managing accounts, so I am relatively good at handling new and old bookkeeping. If there are ordinary affairs, I am also willing to serve sincerely. I am looking forward to good news from any quarter in this publication.</p>

<p>A certain children's toy company in this city has entrusted the editor to recruit four or five female shop assistants who are proficient in Cantonese, Shanghainese, and English, and who have a considerable understanding of child psychology are qualified. Graduates from kindergarten normal schools are especially suitable. Monthly salary is from thirty to sixty yuan. Those who wish to apply should provide a detailed resume and submit it to the editor for forwarding.</p>

<p>Last night, I was walking home from the office and reached the intersection of Lyuban Road when I suddenly heard a loud call:</p>
<p>"The Great Evening News! Three copper coins a copy."</p>
<p>Then a thing that seemed black but not black, seemed white but not white waved in front of me. I stared at it: it turned out to be a child of about ten years old, holding a stack of newspapers in his left hand, and waving another one in his right hand in front of me. Just then, a smaller child ran up from the right, waving in the same way, shouting in the same way:</p>
<p>"The Great Evening News! Three copper coins a copy."</p>
<p>Great, this spirit of competition! I deliberately asked the two children: "I only need to buy one copy, but which one should I buy it from?" The older child said without competition: "We are brothers, you should buy it from him." This right, the older child was actually willing to give it to his brother, unwilling to create a "fratricidal" drama, how does that compare to the uncles and nephews of the two Liu's in Sichuan?</p>
<p>Those familiar with Ningbo people in Shanghai and those who have social skills, regardless of gender, can apply. Remuneration is mainly on a commission basis, and no position is given. For example, if you get one monthly subscriber, you will be paid one dime, 1.2 yuan per year. If you have 100 monthly subscribers, you can get 10 yuan. A guarantor or cash is required for the guarantee. I hope Mr. can do his best to introduce it. I respectfully greet you. Yang Dehui respectfully.</p>

<p>To Mr. Pu, editor of the Amateur Weekly:</p>
<p>I am an out-of-town reader of your publication in the last two issues. Because I saw that the main articles of your publication are signed with the word "Pu," I shout out the above title, is it not wrong?</p>
<p>Because I admire your publication to one hundred and twenty points, and at the same time, I am limited by the area and cannot subscribe directly, so I wrote a letter to Mr. Shi Liangcai, the general manager of your newspaper, asking him to expand your publication to other cities, not to be confined to one corner, so that we out-of-town Shen Bao readers can enjoy the benefits of reading (the original letter is presented). We know that this is a matter of distribution and not within the power of Mr., so I will not talk too much.</p>
<p>But for the editorial aspect, I also have a request:</p>
<p>I ask you to publish as many articles as possible from us shop assistants, so that the suffering we endure has an opportunity to voice and vent. Usually, shop assistants have some difficult secrets for managers and bosses, but they are afraid of losing their jobs, so they dare not speak out publicly, only resent behind their backs. Therefore, I have no choice but to hope that your publication can be our spokesperson, a guarantor of the interests of us shop assistants. Although I know that under the current social system, the threshold of the school is very high. Without the white ocean dollars to cushion our feet, we cannot cross in. Therefore, the articles we write will certainly be a little unintelligible, and if they are published, it will inevitably collapse the stage of your publication. But with Mr.'s big axe, shaving and polishing for us, as long as it retains its essence, it is not impossible to publish it.</p>
<p>No matter what industry, large or small, it cannot be done well by the manager alone. They must rely on the shop assistants to be of one mind and cooperate fully in order to have the hope of prosperity and development. If the managers and bosses do not understand the suffering of the shop assistants, they are not concerned at all, and although the shop assistants do not say it, they harbor resentment in their hearts, then the future of this store is very dangerous. To avoid this danger, it is not effective to apply oppression. The best way is: let the shop assistants say what difficulties they have: let them contribute what suggestions they have: and the managers and bosses can also take this opportunity to study and improve the way to improve treatment. Isn't this much better than only knowing how to make money with your eyes closed, regardless of other people's lives and deaths, and ending up in bankruptcy?</p>
<p>I hope that Mr. can accept my request, and I hope that your publication will emit infinite light, guiding us distressed shop assistants out of the darkness:</p>
<h3 id="e273">Han Dehui Qiyi, Er, San, <a href="#e273" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c273" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">273</a></h3>
<p>Editor's Note: This publication has always focused on the interests of shop assistants, apprentices, and workers; therefore, in addition to the "Amateur Chats" and "Special Articles" columns, in order to solve their knowledge hunger, we have had to specially invite experts to write. Other columns such as "Problem Discussion," "Life in the Industrial and Commercial Circles," and "Shop Assistants' Correspondence" have always adopted articles from shop assistants. It is inevitable that some of the articles are of poor quality; however, as long as they have practical value, we always revise and publish them, and never dare to send them to the wastepaper basket. We firmly believe that only the shop assistants' own descriptions can be relevant; and only these relevant descriptions can touch the heartstrings of the shop owners. Therefore, we recently wrote "A Sketch of Life in the Wastepaper Basket" and "Congratulations on Getting Rich, Manuscripts Rolling In" in the editorial, just to hope that shop assistants will contribute more articles. Finally, we add a report that Mr. Shi, the president of our newspaper, has decided to accept Mr. Han's request and is preparing to expand this publication to other cities in the near future. At the same time, we should also cheer up and strive to enrich the quality of this publication.</p>

<h3 id="e274">Charles Farrell and Janet Gaynor's Farewell <a href="#e274" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c274" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">274</a></h3>
<p>— Xi Rong</p>
<p>Charles Farrell and Janet Gaynor, the greatest screen lovers in Hollywood, hailed as the Emperor and Empress of film by the global film community, have now divorced on screen. Some may speculate that their on-screen partnership has fractured and their personal friendship has ended. However, such speculation is far from the truth. On the morning that Charles Farrell decided to leave Fox Studios and terminate his contract with studio manager Winfield Sheehan, many staff, actors, and workers gathered in front of Sheehan's office, having heard the bad news. They all thought Charles would change his mind, believing that his status and salary were enough to make him stay. But he resolutely and proudly canceled the contract.</p>
<p>Charles completed all the contract cancellation procedures. Of course, there were many handshakes and words of farewell and comfort. Charles then went to Janet Gaynor's studio to say goodbye to her. At that time, she was filming with a new male lead. Seeing Charles walk in, she immediately stopped working, ran to him, took his hand, and said, "Charles, are you leaving? You're leaving alone. From now on, I'll have to go on alone too." While speaking, Janet seemed to have a thousand words stuck in her throat, unable to express them all, and her eyes were filled with tears. It was a truly sorrowful parting! Afterwards, Charles told people that he had also choked up for a long time and couldn't speak. Judging by this emotional farewell, there was no rift between the two.</p>
<p>Why Charles wants to temporarily leave the screen can be said that he is no longer willing to continue working with Janet. However, he is not dissatisfied with Janet personally or anyone in the company, but rather with the roles he has been getting in the scripts. Because film scripts rarely have roles where both male and female leads are equally prominent, it's impossible to continue collaborating year after year. Therefore, since "Seventh Heaven," in all the films he has co-starred with Janet Gaynor, while Janet's reputation remains unwavering, Charles himself has gradually been relegated to a supporting role. This is something he cannot endure permanently.</p>
<p>Charles has no jealousy towards Janet's fame. He once said, "I would never want Janet to sacrifice her reputation to accommodate me. Her reputation has been built up painstakingly over the years. No one knows Janet better than I do in this regard." Therefore, he had to leave voluntarily.</p>
<p>As for the personal relationship between Charles and Janet, everyone probably knows that they both have families. Janet loves her husband deeply, just as Charles loves his wife deeply. They are among the most morally upright people in Hollywood. Their seven years as screen lovers have not affected their marital love within their families. Charles once said, "Between the two of us, there is the affection of siblings, brotherly and sisterly love, and we are friends who have gone through many hardships together. Our struggles, worries, disappointments, and hopes are shared. We can understand each other. We are considerate and helpful to each other's goals and desires. There is a deep and perfect relationship between us. In fact, there are no better friends on screen than the two of us. The reason lies in our 'honesty and selflessness.'"</p>
<p>From this, I can predict that they will still be able to collaborate in the future, but first they need a good script that allows Charles to regain his true character as Chico, and Janet to continue playing his Dianne.</p>

<p>Although I don't usually enjoy comedies, because China has produced an "Oriental Laurel and Hardy," and I am so concerned about the development of Chinese cinema, I naturally had to see this "great innovation in the Chinese film industry" that was being promoted in the newspapers.</p>
<p>However, this "great contribution" didn't impress me as much as they claimed. But out of a sincere hope for Chinese cinema, I have to be frank.</p>
<p>I have seen George Bernard Shaw's plays and Charlie Chaplin's cane and worn shoes. Although their works are humorous and comedic, even I, who am a complete amateur when it comes to comedy, feel that they have depth and are worth contemplating, even bringing tears to my eyes amidst laughter. I can't help but admire them; I have to admit that they are illuminators of life. However, this particular comedy, although its theme is to ridicule "heroes" and expose their true nature, unfortunately does not evoke any kind of stimulus in us.</p>
<p>The performance abilities of Liu Jiqun and Han Langen seem to be insufficient. Director Zhuang Guojun's assistance is also minimal, and in many places, we can see that the director's skills are not refined. The other supporting actors are all stiff, so people who are used to watching foreign slapstick films cannot help but feel bored. However, comparatively speaking, Liu Jiqun is better than Han Langen, because Mr. Han overacts.</p>
<p>In other aspects, the lighting is too dim, and the cinematography is not skillful. However, the subtitles are very well done.</p>
<p>However, the last few scenes are very good. The way the same actor cross-dresses as a woman and a child is indeed very interesting. Of course, this is due to the director's cleverness, but also to the efforts of the screenwriter.</p>
<p>I heard from a friend that this is much better than Liu Chunshan's "Chicken and Duck Couple," but I haven't seen "Chicken and Duck Couple." Moreover, since this is an "innovation" and has achieved this much, it is still quite satisfying, so I have great hope for their future.</p>
<p>Finally, because I followed many viewers in laughing for a while and still have the taste of laughter in my heart, I couldn't help but be a bit unrestrained in my sentence construction when writing this review. However, I have sincere intentions, which insightful readers should be able to understand.</p>

<p>— Jing Wu</p>
<p>Regarding Charles Farrell and Janet Gaynor</p>
<p>Hollywood rumors are truly bizarre. If you are a famous star, then there will be even more rumors about you. Charles Farrell is one of them.</p>
<p>After Charles Farrell finished filming "Street Angel," Hollywood rumors started, saying that he was in love with the female lead of "Street Angel," Joan Crawford, and that they often frequented cafes together, and the rumors were very convincing. But Charles just smiled and ignored them, and soon the rumors disappeared.</p>
<p>One rumor disappeared, and another one came. Hollywood rumored again. After Charles Farrell and Janet Gaynor finished filming "The First Year of Marriage" and "The Tide of Love," these rumors spread almost all over Hollywood. It was said that Janet and Charles's love was rekindling. Janet was going to divorce her husband, and Charles was also preparing to dissolve his marriage contract with his wife. As a result, many reporters went to Janet's place to interview her, which made Janet cry. She said, "Heavens! Why do so many people like to spread rumors like this? You know, my husband loves me very much." On Charles Farrell's side, he felt that this rumor was malicious. Later, many film publications dispelled the rumors for the two of them, and the rumor gradually disappeared.</p>

<p>— Yu</p>
<p>This is a dull, drizzly film. It depicts the dark side of the bright and beautiful islands of the South Seas, with the struggle between religion and desire. A pastor, a border guard, and a wandering woman of unknown origin form this pool of rainwater – a symbol of depression and lust.</p>
<p>Rain, always rain, the dull tropical rain of the South Seas, beating on banana leaves, drop by drop, like sorrowful tears, like greedy saliva, crawling into people's hearts like snakes. This is the suggestion the whole film gives us, but the performance is very dull and not deeply moving. Joan Crawford also tries hard but doesn't get good results, and every move is like an American hillbilly. Because she focuses too much on expressing local class colors, she loses universality, so Easterners don't find it very interesting. The depiction of religion is also a localized American style, so people don't feel the grandeur of Catholicism or the pure faith of Christianity. The director is also not a top talent, and the monotony and repetition are tiresome. A very good subject is ruined. From beginning to end, it's like reading a laborious realistic novel.</p>
<p>In addition, from an objective perspective, of course, half of the reason is that we don't understand American accents very well. Otherwise, we could just treat it as a stage play to "listen" to, and maybe we would be more satisfied? However, since the result is like this, then our sympathy for this film is only separated by the rain.</p>

<p>— Jiang Qing</p>
<p>In Broadway and many other large cities in the United States, the companies that manage the rental of films have specially hired many people to do film repair work. When repairing, one end of the film is rolled onto the reel of the repair machine, and the holes on both sides of the film are carefully checked for cracks and damage. If the film is broken or missing, it is also repaired. Usually, a set of films needs to be repaired after being shown more than four times. The cost of repair is very high. This business has been very developed recently. It can be said that these are two kinds of light jobs, and most of the workers are women.</p>

<p>His painful cry forced her to go one step further. "Gray, my darling! I can't abandon him; he's so pathetic. He begged me not to go. If you heard him speak, if you saw his misery, you wouldn't bear to force me to go with you and leave this lonely man here. He'll go crazy again, you know? He says he loves me, always loves me. He makes me believe that if I leave, he won't live. Ah, Gray! He keeps tempting me like this, making me believe that if I'm not with him, he'll do something rash, and I'm too ____, and I end up believing he'll do it. Please, Gray, I simply can't bear to do this to you! I know my will is too weak, but please forgive me."</p>
<p>Margaret's frantic plea disturbed Gray's mind. He lowered his head, pondered for a while, and said firmly, "Margaret, I know your emotions right now, but if you truly love me, then come with me. You know how much I love you – I've waited for you for five whole years, and now is the time when our happiness can soon be realized. I will never give you up! Moreover, you've sacrificed your whole life for him, is he worth your sacrifice? Come on – I don't believe you've made the final decision to stay here with him. How can you suffer here for a lifetime? How can you love him like a wife should love her husband?"</p>
<p>Numbed and confused, Margaret said, "Ah, Gray, please don't say any more! How can you say such things? You know that I don't love anyone but you, but I can't, I can't bear to leave him!"</p>
<p>"And I will never leave you!" Gray said passionately.</p>

<p>No one knew that Hillary had heard most of their conversation. When he arrived, he had stopped Dr. Han Lie at the door, wanting to take a walk on the grass first before going into the house. He saw two figures inside through the French windows and was about to go in and see when he heard Margaret's mournful cries and Gray's reply. So, he held back his steps and carefully considered what he had heard. But is it true? She has never sincerely loved him? She pities him, but doesn't love him! (To be continued)</p>
