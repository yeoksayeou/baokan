<p>日本廣田外相近傾注全力。以運用其和平手腕。誠如紐約晚報所謂日本之希望「爲太平洋中之日本和平。」該報又謂「日本之希望二。一爲首先與蘇俄維持和平。要求蘇俄撤除俄國沿邊一帶之兵備。日本則擬撤廢其不。</p>
<p>屬於日本土地之兵備。其意正欲保全其最近侵占之土地也。二爲希望與英。</p>
<p>美各大國。作海軍平等之談判。且以爲中國現值福建多事之秋。正可乘此時機。利用歐洲時局之緊張。使蘇俄利益與英美利益相對立以坐收漁人之利。」而其結論。則在希望各國外交家。能以靈敏手腕。揭破日本外交之隂謀。而不墮其陷穽。該報斯論。誠可謂爲洞悉目前日方之情勢。然以吾人觀之。亦未免太覺過。慮矣。</p>

<p>分成功之希望。今則廣田之手腕無論若何敏妙。終巳坐失時機夫美俄十六年來邦交斷絶之殭局。即爲美俄兩國外交上一種重大之牽掣。俄於日本侵占東北四省後向北滿邊境示威。而俄見始終以和平手段對付。甚至提出出賣中東路之交涉。并再退步而核减其價格。其所以如此敷衍日本者。正以美未承認復交。慮國際形勢之孤立。故不敢遽出以强硬態度。迨復交發表而後。蘇俄一方即停止中東路之交涉。一方在俄邊一帶趕辦軍事上之凖備其决心巳顯然可見。則其必不爲日方外交所惑。可斷言也。美國在太平洋之地位。甚爲重要。自太平洋上之海軍造艦競爭起。形勢日趨嚴重。一方固未肯輕易抛棄其逺東有望之市塲。一方亦不願貿然拚擲國力。以保全被逺在東方之殖民地丨丨菲利濱。因之與日本。雖在政治上極度矛盾中。尚尋求所以相安互讓之道然而日本則仍盡量發展其元始鬭爭之本能。并自命爲亞細亞門羅主義之盟主。并在西太平洋上封鎖美國之西漸。日本此種制霸之計畫而果成功。則首當其衝者。不在於努力閉關圖暫自保之蘇俄。亦不在以香港爲第一防線以印度爲根據之英吉利。而在亟欲開發逺東支持菲列濱保存關鳥海軍根據之北美合衆國。美國至是權衡利害。勢不得不對俄捨棄以往固執之成見。而幡然與之言和。故其决心與俄言和之。日即决心與日抵抗之</p>
<p>時。前數日日本所倡之親美論。旣爲美國輿論界所漠視。則此次廣田所倡之太平洋和平運動。恐亦如投之泡影而巳至於英美之間。雖於經濟問題尚不。</p>
<p>免有所爭執。然亦未嘗不易諒解。從政治方面言。利害所關。勢必將趨於一致。而日英之間。則英國正深感日本經濟侵略之苦痛。幾於全國一致奮起以抵。</p>

<h3 id="c178">閙房與敬酒烟 <a href="#c178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>— 橋</p>
<p>儘管說結婚是文明了，許多習慣的禮法，還是不能破除的。</p>
<p>像新嫁娘到了洞房，親友們就得大閑特閙，老話說的：「三朝嘸大小，外公在床上甩虎跳。」見得閙房是喫喜酒的題中應有之義。在從前看小脚，成了一個普遍的題目。現在革命了，要求新娘唱毛毛雨，和新郎握手了，這也算是進步罷？那主婚人最爲難了，没有人閙，似乎靜悄悄地，太不熱閙，老話又說：「閙發。」閙而後發，這裡面還有一點小哲學。假使閙得太凶，又不便上前阻止。因此常有笑話閙出來，似乎不久以前，徐州達閙出一塲血案來呢。</p>
<p>畢竟蘇州人輕鬆些，他們總是借討喜果爲由，一切條件都繫在喜果上。要是喜客人乖覺些，伴房靈活些，把喜果布施得慷慨些，對答得軟熟些，就可以大事化爲小事，小事化爲無事，新房内的安全，可以保持。因此嫁女兒，要揀選伴房，成了一樁重要事件。</p>
<p>男宅的賀客旣然把娘閙得烏烟瘴氣，女宅的賀客也不能示弱的。於是等到回門的當兒。紛紛向新郎敬酒，便是一個報復的機會。倘然新郎口軟些，簡直没有辦法應付，有的竟學着高力士長跪進酒，受之力有所不勝，却之心有所不安，比什麽都難過。倘然新客人（新郎坐筵的時候，有女喜檳相侍，亦是奇蹟。）善於詞令，或是能够代喝一點，還好解圍，壤在蘇州的規矩，賀客不散席，新郎不能先走的。因此有閙到天明還没有完，新郎醉得不省人事的笑話了。</p>
<p>我只就蘇州而言，不知道别處怎樣，恐怕比蘇州還要熱烈些罷。依我的意思，凡事總得適中一點，不可過分，閙房和敬酒，都足以增加興趣，使莊嚴的婚禮中，添一點生動的穿揷。倘然過於認眞，便覺得掃興而乏味了。</p>
<h3 id="c179">飯碗 <a href="#c179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>— 馮摩尼</p>
<p>我每天的空閒時間，總是在樓下友人開設的烟紙店内，代爲賣賣香烟，也很有趣，借此可以消磨時光。但是每天總有幾個乞丐，常常來討香烟匣子，起初我還不大明白他們要香烟匣子的有意，後來他們來討的時候，我便問他有何用處。他答道：我們要香烟匣子，當做飯碗用的，所以天天來討厭先生。我聽了他的話，方纔明白，吃飯用香烟匣子當作飯碗，表示他十足道地的窮漢。</p>
<p>吃飯果然是很繁難的事，然而吃飯用的飯碗，也很不容易得到的。像豪富之家，飯碗自然不生問題，什麽金邊飯碗，銀花飯碗，隨意可擇，偶耏和了磁質粗糙的飯碗，甚至飯都嚥不下去，於是把傭人訓斥一番，再換考究飯碗，像這等人是很多的。有了錢當然不可不搭架子，否則不足以表示少爺脾氣。一個人吃飯，自然少不了的，飯碗何用考究，吃的是飯，並不吃碗，至於用了粗糙飯碗，飯都吃不下去，眞是笑話奇談，也就是表演中國少爺的劣根性，如果請有錢的少爺到貧民窟裏去走一遭，定然摇首稱奇的說：爲什麽這樣不講究衛生，用那烏灰色的青花大碗吃飯，認爲很奇怪的一樁事。</p>
<p>富人用了金邊飯碗。尚且還有磁質粗細之别，行乞丐兒甚至粗糙飯碗都買不起，用那香烟匣來代替。兩者相較，不啻天堂地獄，雖是各人環境不同，伹也該深悉貧民的窘狀，就不該搭足自架子了。一個人，說不定一世富有，設使一旦環境變動，那就處處都覺得不稱心了。　　所以富人有了燕窩海參的小菜，飯只吃半碗，不是縐着眉頭說胃口不好，定是撳着胸脯說心裏痛。丐兒吃了人家的剩飯殘羹，依然鮮龍活跳的生存着，並且一些不考究衛生，從來没有胃口不好心裏痛的病症，或許這兩種人的體質不同吧？</p>

<p>— 天虚我生</p>
<p>最妥善之儲藏法，先將泥土洗凈擊碎，不必晒乾，裝入洋鐵火油箱中，每箱裝足二十五斤，每四箱爲一担，於是空隙處，注入「醛液」，（係甲</p>
<p>醛即蟻醛）務使完全侵没，乃用焊錫封好，即可藏至對年，但勿洩氣，决不變壞。</p>
<p>醛液亦名「一炭間質液」，譯稱「福爾馬林」Ｆormalin，純品但用百分之一，即可保存至六個月以上，但市上所售之「福爾馬林」，内含甲醛（ＣＨ２０）不過百分之四十，其餘均爲（Ｈ２Ｏ）即平常之水，不含炭氣，故須配用百分之四，即每一磅之「福爾馬林」應配二十五磅之水，方能保存至對年不壞，福爾馬林各儀器館均有售，但定價表中，所刋價目第磅乃需二元五角，如向工業原料店家購買，其價雖廉，但非原桶不可，零購大概八角或一元，如無購處，可向利用造紙廠購用，則十磅五磅均可，每担葵根不過用一磅耳。</p>
<p>（注意）泥土務須洗凈，如不洗凈，則浸出之液，内有黑點，即無法除去，不能供紙廠之用。</p>
<p>今年因種户自相貶價競賣，每担己由六元降至三元，但在用户，均係地窖儲藏，决不能在一時之間，躉買一年之貨</p>
<p>大概用到明年二三月間，無不告慰，改用鑤花，如有葵根可買，若售五六元一担，能比鑤花爲廉，當然仍用葵根，可以自定限價，托由利用廠登記担數，隨時介紹於用户，庶幾求供雙方，均得便利，並可免除競賣阖風，不致自相殘殺也。</p>

<p>更向下行，又登一峯，巨石如鼓，名卽石鼓峯，志云：鼓鳴則主歳凶，嗚呼，今己不聞鼓鳴久矣，其眞太平盛世矣乎？鼓上又有巨石，上廣而下窄，其巔超出其根丈餘，高可十丈，仰頭望之，可以落帽，側而觀之，形如蛙仰其首，卽青蛙峯也。青蛙如此，石鼓之大可知。再由舊徑，返至寺門，則所謂天池，已爲儀君尋碍，蓮華今己無之，徒有塵萍而己。妮君蘭君，留影其旁，芬君則垂首默立，若有所思，寗君曰：游而己矣，何所思哉。欣然赤足，濯於天池之中，青春豪興，亦攝一影。時剛秋陽在山，暮色己深，乃循原路返舟，夕陽歸棹，清秋殊凄幽色。愚以爲天池之美，惟在於石，石之美，實非他處可及，因錄元顧仲瑛游天池詩一章，以爲之殿：</p>
<p>縈紆白雲路，窈窕青山聯，秋風吹客衣，逸興良翩翩，捫蘿度絶壁，躡蹬窮層巔，崖傾石欲落，樹斷雲復連，兩峯齦牙門，中谷何廓然？大山屹登登，直欲摩青天，小山亦磊落，飛來隨其前，隂隂積古鐵，粲粲開青蓮，神斧削翠骨，天沼含靈泉，玉龍抱寒鏡，倒影清秋懸，憶昔張貞居，寄我琳琅篇，逝者者不可作，新詩結爲傳，舉酒酹白日，萬壑生凄烟，幽歡苦未足，落景忽己遷，美人胡不來？山水空清妍。</p>

<p>第十九回　欲卽欲離同車憶往事　半哭半笑倚枕病殘秋</p>
<p>這樣說了起來，自已實在是不應該。總得找這個機會，和他說幾句話，雖然是不能嫁他，也不妨安慰他兩句。女子的心，是摇動不得的；一摇動之後，就没有法子收拾了。桂枝心裏横擱着一片對不住積之的思想，常是探聽積之有回來的消息没有？轉眼就到了暑假期了，心裏想着，積之必會在這個時候回來的，不時的自甘家門口經過着，看有他的踪跡没有。很快的兩個月，暑假又過去着，巳是到秋季開學了。清閑的時候。積之也不回來，到了開學以後，這樣逺路，他又跪回來作什麽，這也就只好不盼望他了。算一算日期，趙自强到喜峯口去，巳經是五個月了，五個月之中，倒有上十封信寄回來，每一個月約莫總有兩封信到家。他雖寫的是家信，在信上所寫，一大半却是安慰岳家的話。信上說只發了三次餉，而每次發的餉，他都全數寄了回來，說是在喜峯口那地方，有錢也無處可用，辦公費裏有富餘，足夠維持一個人生活的了。趙翁的態度，是非常公正，兒子將欵寄到了家，就要分一半到楊家來。江氏原來是不肯收着用，後來趙翁說，今年下半年，一定是要辦喜事的，拿去和你們大姑娘買點衣料，預備作嫁衣罷，江氏知道老人家是實心眼子，也就照收了。這是舊歷九月中旬時候，北方的天氣，己經是慢慢寒冷起來，大門外路上，向西山去的汽車聲，來往得是更爲熱閙，原來這都是到西山去看紅葉的閑人，每年這個時候，他們總是要忙一陣子的。（二五八）</p>

<h3 id="c183">空氣，風 <a href="#c183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>— 冰玉</p>
<p>包圍地球的空氣，大約有四百基羅約厚。空氣在壓力，呌做氣壓，這氣壓依時候與地方而不同的。諸君在無線電裏能夠聽見「七百六十米里的高氣壓」這句話，就是說一個氣壓在平地上面與海面是的平均，温度的多地方與緯度的高地方以及高山上面等氣壓比較的爲小，譬如在喜馬拉耶山的山頂，平均祇有五百米里樣子。這一個氣壓，在平均一平方米突的面積，有一萬基羅格蘭姆的重量覆載的，外國的小孩子，在野外吵閙時，他們父母們，常常斥駡說；「低氣壓就要來了」這句話比我國迷信的鄉愚們，斥駡兒童時，說有老虎來了；鬼來了……當然有事實可根據的，說到低氣壓是什麽樣呢？就是因爲低氣壓時候，就要降雨與雪了。這風與雨雪等，圍繞地球的表面，約有十五甚羅的高度，然而高氣壓的地方，空氣很多，低氣壓的地方，空氣比較爲少，但是高氣壓很多的地方，也是小的。在低氣壓地方的空氣，不論液體與氣體，共通的保持着的，因空氣的移動而成爲風，可是高氣壓與低氣壓的變化，是大氣中的温度不平等的緣故。至於風因季節的不同有種種差異的，駘蕩的春風，凉爽的夏風，尖厲的秋風，凛烈的冬風，那是混說四季的風，但是風的速度，有種種區别的，假他風速在一秒間，祗有０·三米突以下，則海面亦不會起波，工廠的烟囱，放出來的烟，必定直上的。然而大氣的變化無常，風的速度，常常有變化，於是有（一）微風，（二）輕風，（三）軟風，（四）和風，（五）疾風，（六）大風，（七）强風，（八）疾强風，（九）大强風，（十）全强風，（十一）暴風，（十二）颶風等區别了。所謂微風，其風速是在０·四米突至一·五米突間，那烟囱的烟，就覺到左右摇動了。輕風的速度，是在一·六米突至三·三米突，我們在郊外就感到有風刮面，在海面可看到微波起來了。軟風的速度是在三，四米突至五·四米突，這風吹時，樹的枝葉，就會摇動，懸掛的旗幟，飄飄的飛揚了。和風的速度，在五·五米突以上七·九米突以下，和風起時，地面的砂塵，可以捲起，海面會發生白波。疾風是在八米突至十七米突之間，疾風起時，木葉颼颼的被它吹下來，如在樹林中，就感到樹葉都要摇動了。大風的速度，是在十，八米突至十三·八米突，大風一起，水面的波浪，滾滾的高竪起來，電桿上的電線與樹枝，都要左右上下的動摇了。强風是比大風爲速，大約是在十七米突左右的速度，我們撲面吹來時，在小孩子時候，好像要被它吹倒的樣子。疾强風有二十七·八米突的速度，小的樹枝，常爲其吹折，就是成人也要爲其吹倒，水面的波浪常常要撲到船裏。大强風的風速，在二十四·四米突左右，有吹折小的樹木的力，港灣内的船舶，要防其傾覆，茅草屋的屋頂，常常爲其捲去。全强風的速度愈加厲害，在二十四·五米突至二十八·四米突之間，這風吹時，大的樹木，也要爲其吹倒，暴風，那是更不得了，其風速在三十三·五米突左右，矮小的房屋，常被吹倒，成人在馬路上，也不能立住，暴風經過海面，船舶没有不傾的，因爲暴風起時，海面的波濤，爲其激起，排山倒海的來，非常厲害。颶風爲各種風中最猛烈的，今年我國受颶風的損失，諸君當已明白了，倘若輪船在海上，駛到颶風的眼中，那末，不爲傾覆，就要爲其高高的捲起來的。以上所說的十二種風，是照風的速度而分别的，其他速有各種名稱，就是（一）恒信風，（二）貿易風，（三）季節風，（四）夕風（五）晨風，（六）海陸風，（七）山風，（八）突風（九）龍卷，（十）颭風等，現因限于篇幅，不能一一的說明了。</p>

<p>— 謝筠壽</p>
<p>現在報紙上面，常常見到病家和醫師涉訟的事情，結果法庭上的判决，往往多是不起訴處分，這可以證明醫師並没有錯誤，旣然没有錯誤，爲什麽還要到涉訟的地步呢？吾想除「眞有錯誤以外，其餘涉訟的原因，不外乎兩種：一種是意氣的爭執，一種是對醫術的不滿；所謂意氣的爭執，這是另外一個問題，和本文没有關係，現在吾人要討論的，是病家對於醫術的不滿。</p>
<p>普通一般的病家，有了病來求醫師的時候，以爲醫師總有一種解决的方法，甚至迷信天生著一種病，還必定生著一種藥，就是所謂「是病皆有藥，無鬼不死人」的意思。所以初來求診的時候，極力頌揚醫師，等到因病死了，他的親戚和朋友，必定有許多話說，不是說藥吃壞，便是說手術醫壞，這實在是人們過於重視醫術的緣故。因爲過於重視了，遭遇著疾病不治的時候，會發生一種醫術不滿的感想，感情容易衝動的人，就鬧成涉訟的地步。</p>
<p>怎樣呌做滿意的醫術呢？吾想任何人也難以下一句確切的斷語，現在吾先把醫師的能力，寫在下面，然後再討論怎樣的，呌做滿意的醫術呢。</p>
<p>（一）醫師能夠認識疾病醫師依他的學識經騐和醫療器械的帮助，能夠認識疾病，譬如一樣的發熱，醫師能夠知道甲的發熱是肺炎，乙的發熱是瘧疾，一樣腹痛，醫師能夠知道甲的腹痛是盲腸炎，乙的腹痛是普通的腸炎。</p>
<p>（二）醫師能夠醫治疾病醫師認識了疾病以後，能夠應用藥劑和手術，去治療疾病，譬如白喉用白喉血清，梅毒用洒爾佛散，盲腸炎施行外科手術，把疾病完全治愈，令病人恢復健康。</p>
<p>（三）醫師能夠減輕病人的痛苦有許多疾病，爲現今醫藥能力所達不到的，譬如重症的肺結核和已經轉移的癌腫等等，醫師雖然不能把原病醫治全愈，但是能夠設法減輕病人的痛苦，還有用假足假手，來代替眞足眞手，假眼來裝飾外表，這都是不得己而求其次的方法。</p>
<p>（四）醫師能夠預防疾病　醫師對於疾病，有預防的智識和能力，譬如知道預防天花，能夠種痘，預防霍亂，能夠打霍亂預防針，知道傳染病的所以傳染，呌大家應當怎樣注意，知道猩紅熱以後有腎藏炎樣的續發症，腸傷寒後期，有腸出血和腸穿孔等的危險，血壓過高，應當預防卒中等等，醫師一面呌病家預先留意，一面設法預防。</p>
<p>（五）醫師能夠斷定預後　譬如一種疾病，病勢外貌非常凶險，一種疾病，病勢外貌非常和平，醫師能夠斷定甲病雖然凶險，可以不必耽憂，乙病雖然和平，到是可虞，以及巳經轉移的癌腫和巳經變成瀰漫性腹膜炎的盲腸炎，醫師能夠預先知道他預後的不良。</p>
<p>以上的種種，好算是滿足的醫術嗎？就是吾也不敢答應下來，而且醫師能力所及的地方，也往往因人事萬變，環境不一，疾病的毒力有輕重，病人的抵抗力有大小，以及特異體質的有無，意外變故的發生，疾病治療的成績，並非一定不變，所以儘有從事預防的工作，疾病依然發生，輕症的感冒，忽然變成肺炎，腸傷寒忽然，釀成腸穿孔，以及用金鷄納霜發生著黑水病，用血清發生著血清病，用全身麻醉而死，注射六零六而亡，有名的外科大家，也有施手術而死的病人，在病家講起來，都是醫師醫術的不良，在醫學上講起來，呌做手術的不幸，或是偶發症，爲人力難以挽回的事情。古時有一個羅馬名醫加倫，他有一句話，現在介紹在下面；</p>

<h3 id="c226">中國肺病之危機及當今之急圖（上） <a href="#c226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>— 丁惠康</p>
<p>以我國社會最流行之疾病而論，則肺症之蔓延，實爲最嚴重之一問題。但考之實際，肺病非必不治之症，乃實可愈之病，其所以肆其兇燄，而莫之能遏者，約有數端。</p>
<p>（一）國人缺乏普通衛生常識。隨時隨地，均有傳染之危險。</p>
<p>（二）國人無普通醫學知識。當病之初起症狀極微，每每忽視，且不知醫治方法，致一般患者，大都失去不當治療時期。</p>
<p>（三）過分信仰醫家。國人因乏正當觀念，遇病因循，往往不能澈底解决，一經延請醫家診察後，即視爲己盡人事，而忽視其他一切更重要之療養方法。</p>
<p>（四）迷信藥物之萬能。時至今日，「肺病無特效藥」巳爲全世界醫藥界所公認，但病家多自作聰明，以爲肺病乃慢性病，僅須服藥調理足矣。於是服甲藥不效，則改服乙藥，又不效，再購丙藥而服之，如是一再蹉跎，不知不覺，馴至病勢沉重，方開始療養，則己晚矣。</p>
<p>現時我國肺病患者之衆多，其原因雖非一端，簡言之，約如上述。然亡羊補牢，猶未爲遲，補救之方，果何在乎。</p>
<p>（一）國家宜設立肺病究院，</p>
<p>肺病研究院，須聘請國内外專家主持之。凡關於澄清病原之方法，公共衛生之實施，隔離病家之執行，以及預防接種特效藥物之研究，均爲主要任務。此種關係民族健康之偉大事業，以我國社會情形及病肺者之衆多·雖由國家年撥經費數十百萬，以專門研究之，亦不爲過。惜我國建設，萬事落後，在政会不特經費無着，即專門人材，亦形缺乏，縱令有之，亦僅能開業問世，以求餬口，其能終身孜孜，潛心研究，以求福國利人之眞正大醫學家，在我國眞如鳳毛麟角之不易多見，故肺病研究院之設立，在目前肖爲不可能之事實，不得己，思其次。　　（二）宜普及衛生教育注重鍜鍊體格</p>
<p>我國教育，不能普及，故民衆大都無衛生，及醫藥常識。爲今之計，宜就現有之各學校，將公共衛生及普通醫藥常識列入課程之中，使人人明瞭對於疾病預防之方法，及治療之大要。夫今日之求學者，欲異日之出其學而用於世也，身乃學之本，此等關係生命健康之重要智識，安可不稍灌輸之乎。世間不乏勤奮逾恒之學生，畢業後因患肺病而逝世者，大好英才，坐令埋没，可悲孰甚。故今應由衛生及教育當局妥爲議定，關於衛生醫藥及鍜鍊體格之課程，在目前難不能收若何效果，但在日後，其收效必鉅，蓋全國教育普及之時，即預防肺病成功之日，爲必然之勢也。但此乃就預防肺病而言，至於撲滅肺病，非令病家有相當之醫藥智識不可，其法維何，試述其管見。</p>
<p>（三）各縣各區宜多設立預防肺病研究會將預防及治療要識，用通俗方法，普及於民衆，使一般無病者知所預防，己病者可知正當治療方法，不致爲庸醫僞藥所誤，自救救火，此爲最善之方法。</p>
<p>上海爲我國醫藥界之中心黠，對於此項重要問題，至今歳始由吳鐵城市長及李廷安局長發起成立防癆恊會，未始非差慰民望之一舉，惟如何徵求會員，及會務如何進行，至今尚無報告，或成立未久，諸待規劃進行耳。</p>

<p>— 趙璚黄</p>
<p>西洋本草時代，繼戴司可利特氏之後，而生格倫氏（Ｇalenusi30-20Ａ，Ｄ，）博一時名醫之榮譽。普里紐氏（ＣliniusＳecundue23-79Ａ，Ｄ，）與恩賽克洛丕台氏（Ｆdcyclopedis），亦降生於其間。至紀元三世紀以後，自奥利巴修氏（ＯribasiusＣa325-400Ａ·Ｄ·）以下，則知名者次第少矣。漸入中世紀。黑暗時代，殆無科學上有價之記錄。伹離經黑暗時代，幸憶希臘羅馬之文藝復興，人才輩出。亞刺伯人中，傳齊如拉司，戴司可利特之衣鉢者不少。植物學家如布倫弗耳氏（Ｂrunfeis1498-1544）福克氏脫拉顧氏稱德意志植物學三交（ＴhreefathersofＧermanobotany）及華留來司柯達士（ＶaleriusＣordusi515-1544）著成植物記（ＨistoriaＳtilium1519年版）確定其科學基礎。本草學家如亞尾孫那氏西拉比翁（ＳerapionＣa1110）諸學者亦薈萃於十世紀至十五世紀之間。碩學如伊彭貝泰，（ＩbnＢaithar+1248）復相繼而出。當時坊間流布之本草書籍，銷</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>行極盛。論其本草之内容程度，與吾國陶隱居修訂之神農本草經（西曆５０２年）相彷彿也。重版至數十次者，如ＭacorＦloridusＡraldＶillanovaＰlatoariolamily，ＡbortusＭagnus等記載，則較吾國本草書，猶勝一籌。其普拉他來二世（ＭattesＰlatearioＩＩ）之藥用植物字典，（ＣirceＩnstans約１１３４年間完成）爲當時最通俗之本草書。擷其結萃而成之圍解本草，曾風靡一世。其中國於動植鑛物之圖說，重版至數十次者，爲無名氏健康之圍，（Ｏrtussanitatis）（初版恐在１４７５年以前）及其論譯ＪohanvonＣubaＧartdorＧdeundbeit（１４５８年版）與其變體之Ｋreutterbuch（１５３３年版等書。又法之ＬaＧrantＨerbicrenfrancoys（１４９０年版）及其翻刻本。英譯之ＴhoＧreteＨerbal（１５１６年版）及其翻刻本等，誠有不遑枚舉者。自是以後，此等通俗本草書之著作，用Ｈerbal（本草）之名稱者，漸次普及。如葛勞特（）ＪＧorard）之ＴheＨerball，（本草書）獨獨奴氏（ＲＤodonacus1517-1585）之Ｃruydboeck，（本草書）其著例也。又同一種著作，有用著書者之本國語者，則較爲通俗。有用拉丁語記述者，則反乎本草之書常態，面具植物學書之面目。例如脫拉顧氏（Ｔragus１４９８－１５５４）之“Ｋreuterbuce”（年版）與”Ｓtirpiummaximeaorum”（１６５２年版）之兩書是也。尚有林娜氏以前倪福夫（Ｋniphoh”之藥用本草，所謂ＯffizinelＫrauterbuch”（１７３３－３４年版）等者，與ＦerndinandＭull之“ＤasgrosseillustriertoＫrauterbucb”（１８６０年初版），至今猶在民間，重版不絶。蓋西洋人對於古代本草，隱然認爲民間科學之一而保守之。故本草學之權威，不因植物學之進步而稍减，且與植物學有相輔發達，相得益彰之妙。卒能釀成近世的生藥學（Ｐharmakognosie）（Ｍateriamedical）。由醫藥而分一種燦然大備之獨立科學者，非數千年以來，受植物學家與本草家之賜乎。（完）</p>

<p>— 王曉嵐</p>
<p>（三）刺取脊髓液法　病者腦脊髓腔内含有炎症滲出液，如腦内壓力增强，引起各種刺激症狀。如施行醫哲庫克（Ｏumche）氏所創始之腰脊穿刺法，酌取腦脊髓液，則内壓低降，諸症隨之緩解。取出之液量，宜視内壓高低以定其多寡，通常每次約二０至八０西西，兒童酌減，按日或隔日行之。如脊髓液混濁，雜有膿汁，更可於刺取時，注入滅菌生理食鹽水，反覆洗滌，至澄清爲度，然後注入血清，獲效尤著。</p>
<p>（四）藥物療法　病者若熱度過高，疼痛强劇，可服解熱鎭痛劑，阿司匹靈。（Ａspyrin）非那塞珍·（Ｐhenacetin）克利金·（Ｃryogenine）等，若失眠·譫語·狂躁不安，可服鎭靜安眠劑，溴化鉀，溴化鈉·凡羅那爾（Ｖeronal）等，或注射鎭痙劑，嗎啡·盼得本斯可博拉明（ＰantoponＳcopolamin）等，或用緑養冰灌腸。若便秘·尿閉，則行灌腸或通尿法，并可兼服瀉劑，甘汞·大黄等，或服尿消毒劑，烏羅透賓（Ｕrotropin）若心臟衰弱，可用强心劑，樟腦製品海克賽通（Ｈexeton），毛地黄製品狄笳令（Ｄigalen）等，或注射，或内服。近時對於本病，更有用體内消毒劑，電銀膠（Ｅlectrargol），脫吕帕弗拉文（Ｔrypaflavin）等注射者，間亦獲效。</p>
<p>腦膜炎之預防</p>
<p>本病流行時，當注意衛生，保持清潔，住屋宜空氣流通，光線充足，隂溝厠所及污穢處，常灑石灰酸或生石灰水消毒。凡嗜好烟酒，感冒風寒，身心過勞，或頭蓋受外傷者，皆易誘發本病，尤須愼防。又淋巴體質之人，或鼻·咽·扁桃腺等部，時起炎症，有易罹本病之棗因者，更宜常用消毒藥水，如緑酸鉀水·雙養水等，滌口嗽喉。倘覺頭眩腦漲，身體不安，應隨時醫治，不可忽視。</p>
<p>隔絶病者，避免傳染，爲預防之要務。故遇有本病或疑似症發現，應即與健康者分居，并禁親友探視。病室及一切雜物，非經消毒，他人不可使用。多人羣集之所，難免無病郵混入，須絶跡不往。口鼻爲病菌侵入門户，在本病流行期内，須覆口罩，并時以消毒藥水清洗。倘與人交談，不可接近。凡入病家，或與病者接近之人，應注射腦膜炎菌苗，或腦膜炎血清。</p>
<p>腦膜炎菌苗注入人身，能產生免疫體，抵抗病菌侵襲。每人應注射三次，隔四五日行之。其注射部位，或皮下，或股内，用量宜逐漸增加，最多以一西西爲限，兒童酌减。如體温增高，罹脚氣·心·腎等患，或姙娠者均忌用。在病疫盛行，欲迅速獲得免疫力時，可光法血清十西西於皮下，或肌内，再注菌苗。因血清效力較菌苗爲速，伹不若菌苗持久，故以兼用爲宜。近來所用之血清菌苗，多爲中央防疫處颧上海衛生試騐所製品，臨用時，能參閱所附之說明書，尤爲穩妥。（完）</p>

<p>近世社會經濟，日形窮困，食糧　給，復失均衡，一方生產者因價格盛落，所得恒不足以償失，釀成豐年饑之慘象：他方消費者，亦因需給變動之摩定，生活上大受脅迫。加以牟利之徒，壟斷市塲，在此資本主義下放任自由競　之結果·頓失國民經濟結構　機能。顧米　　國民之主要食物，設無整個相當計畫以爲調劑，其非爲國家之福明甚。近來各國甚多主張米榖統制說與米榖專賣　者。以爲　節需給維持價格救濟農村之根本方策，以其足可借鏡；除日本之統制米榖，己於上月初本刋發表外，兹就專賣制度與　　之關係，分述於下，籍爲留心食繡問願者之參考。</p>
<h3 id="c232">米榖專賣之理論 <a href="#c232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>主張米榖專賣之理論，究以何者爲根據乎？以今日之情勢觀之，實爲亟不容緩之圖。兹先就二種專賣論，略述其利弊：二財政專賣：亦稱收入專賣，一國政府，爲謀財政上之收入，施行專賣之意。此種專賣，大抵因一國財政窮乏，政府將某種生產物，以廉價進，復以專價賣出，由其賣買間所得之利益，以抵補政府財源之收入，故亦得謂爲營利專賣。然而米榖而爲專賣，如以低價買進，則農民必受損失，高價賣出，消費者又加重負擔，豈非違反食糧政策之旨乎？（一）救濟專賣，亦稱慈善專賣，與財政專賣，適相反對，卽政府預定財政上一定之損失，以高價買進，低價賣出之意，此種專賣，限於特别時期行之，與吾國常平及平糶之制相近。蓋高價買人，旣利於農民，低價賣出，又利於消費者，此亦不盡然，如出新時榖賤則買，青　時　整貴則賣，在財政困難之國，究不能無限　的實行也，（三）經濟專賣：又種新制專賣，與　一者均異，政府不受財政上之負擔，但亦無何等財政上之收入，不還就買進價格，加上事務費，而爲賣聃法也，今所論之米榖專賣，卽屬於此種專賣，政府　米榖之生產費計算買進，加上極少之經費，賣與消費者，故政府卽無損益可言，而生產與消費者，頗樂於服從也。由此可知米榖專賣之目的，决不能因專賣而犧牲國民，或增加政府之負擔，又不能　專賣而犧牲政府，以慈善的救濟國民，其目的將重要國民生產物，以最合理的，配給於國民　體，故爲合理的一種社會經濟的機能也。因此賣買之獨占，不得不歸國家所有，蓋　任私人經營，不惟無利可言，反蒙標大之損失。（甲）米榖價格的騰落，在國民經濟上，影響甚人，操　市塲之投機者，　亂行情，企圖不法的利益在在皆是，故政府係國民經濟全體着想，應　米榖價格安定，卽生產者農家，因價格穩定，得以努力於農作物之改良，與收穫之增加，消費賣亦因收人　係，與於日常主食物，更爲期望。（乙）米榖在經濟的本質，在資本主義下雖放任各人之自由競爭，然以某得度爲限，欲保持生產與消費之調節，全在價格之調筎作用，俾得伸縮商品之生產與消費，豐如某釋商品，因需要　增，遂教價格騰　，生產者以其有利，互謀生產之增加，於是生產物之供給必多，遂引起價格之低落。米榖之生產消費亦然，不過米榖生產額之多寡，雖可以人爲的增加收益，但嘗因自然的與偶然的原因，面民豐歉，究不若其他產業，得以驟然增加產量，而消費者亦不能因價格騰貴，减少食量，雖現今米榖之性質，己由國内變爲國際的性質，卽本國雖屬荒年，而鄰國如在豐年，仍可以調節數量，但在國内，則應由政府專賣，自可調節其價格數量也。</p>
<h3 id="c233">米榖專賣效果 <a href="#c233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>米榖專賣之效果。凡有四種，（一）專賣能使價格安定。（一）照專賣制度將專價買進，廉價賣出其間可以縮少價格之變化。（三）專賣可以確立農家經濟，以期農村經濟復原。（四）專賣可以確保國民之食糧供給。然上列四大效果，究在如何意味與如何程度，得以期待乎？吾人可由純場問的檢討之。如上所述，價格之變動，不論對於生產者與消費者，均蒙損害，目米榖之生產消費數量，與其他商品不同，每不因其價格變動，得以調節，故不易發揮經濟上之全機能。不過米榖價格之變動與安定，其中含有種種意義：卽　米榖價格　季需而變動，普通以收　後數月，其價必落，青黄不接期内必貴。（二）因豐歉而變動，大抵豐年價落，凶年價漲，（三）因景氣而變動，卽與一榖經濟界之景氣變動而差殊。然亦有收穫期本爲普通，而價格反　低廉，或在凶作之年，頗呈如景氣，米價反形　騰，亦有在青黄不接時期，因上年貯蓄米尚多，而本年又極豐收，未見如何變動者：若實行專賣，究能安定價格乎？兹就下列各點言之：卽（一）季節變動與專賣制度，查米價的季節變動，對於地主與米商，最爲有利。何則？蓋彼輩在青黄不接時期，爲米之所有者，反之，對於自作　佃户貧農等，因困於金錢，當米發收入後，不拘價格之低落，或將來可望上騰，亦不得不與米榖，出，特貧　因需欵緊廹，甚　對於自用飯米，亦悉數出售，迨至青黄不接時期，再行買進，其間因賣買關係，所受損失，自不待言，故實行專賣，卽能緩和季　價格之變動。（一）豐歉動與專賣制度，在專賣制度之下，米價可以固定。惟决定米榖價格之基本標準，重在米榖之生產費。而此標準的生產費，因年之豐歉而不同。何則，農家耕作之面積，與投下的資本勞動，雖每年無入軒輊，然結果所得之收穫量，因年之豐歉而增减。若實行專賣，卽可免豐歉而變動價格。（三）量氣變動與專賣制度，米榖之價格，常因一般經濟界之景氣而變動，在好景氣時期，收入增加，不景氣時期，收入减退，故消費者對於主食物米榖，可比例彼等之收入，卽比例一般經濟界之景氣變動而騰落，生產者之農民，在好景氣時期，因增加勞動需要，遵得增加資本收益，然因肥料與其他原料費用高貴，故米價亦不得不提高，此生產費爲標準，米榖價格，自依景氣而變動。且一般物價，亦因景氣變動爲中心而動摇，如在專賣制度下，因定一定之價格，卽能緩和其變動縐勢。蓋生產者之農家經濟，比一　景氣爲安定，則米榖價格之變動，可在　景氣以下變動，換言之，米榖指數，比一般物價指數爲小也。雖然，反對專賣者，認爲價格安定，遏制一定程度以上之希望。但吾人就國民全體的經濟比較言之，仍以專賣爲有利也。况就救濟農村問題而言，在今日農村，負債累累，農產物價暴落，實爲當前之重大問題。苟實行專賣，使米榖價格安定，農家對於經營農業，卽有一定之成算，農業可望健全的發達。况今日米榖價格之漲　無定，健全的農業，竟墮於最危險投機業者之中，遂致傳統的農業精神，毁滅殆盡。不寗惟是，且因專賣，可以確保食糧之供給，調　需供之數量。近年來天災人禍，相繼不絶，倘放任私人營利，全國民所蒙影響伊於胡底。而豐作之過剩與作凶之不足，政府得以儲榖自由調節之；他如外米之傾銷，得照專賣法，亦可統制。約言之，在一定條件之下，得以自由規定　級價格流通調和者也。</p>

<p>專賣的方法，爲專賣事業最困難問題，倘設施不當，不惟不能收　當效果，反引起無窮糾紛。何則？凡買進價格對於生產費之决定，與收買範圍如何，以及分給出賣等，須有眞縝密計畫。兹就重要實行之方法，分述如下：（一）决定買進價格問題，反對專賣論者，對於收買價格，重在米之生產費，而所謂生產費，究從如何决定歟，實爲不易斷之第一點。蓋米榖之生產費，依地方而不同，江浙與兩粤大異，直魯與甘逈殊，欲嚴密的就各地調查其實情，誠屬不易。則依生產費收買時，不得不按照田地而異其價格。如此，對於專賣制度之出發穎，卽陷於實行不可能之境。但主張專賣論者，以爲照現實生產費，必不能實行，蓋農業者投下之勞動資本因其田地所得之生產費買進時，例如農家因不注意於灌溉除草施肥病虫害等，自不能得原來之收穫，而勤勉努力之農家，况得普通以上之增收，如前以萬價進，後以低價買進，不免發生矛盾，故買進價格，不能照現實生產費計算。應在一定範圍内之生產地，將現實生產費，爲平均的或標準的折衷之。惟所謂標準生產費，有全國的標準生產費，與一省一縣一鄉的標凖生產費。今所論者，卽就全國的標準而言，同時就各省各縣。分别等級，加以折衷。例如全國的標凖生產費爲一００，將全號分爲十二等級，其各國指數爲九五·九六·九七·一０五時，則全國生產費，每石爲二十五元，一等地爲二十三元七角半·五等地爲二十四元七角半，十一等地爲二十六元二角半。不過欲算出全國標準的生產費，非常不易，須照技術方法計算。詳言之，先就全國的標準生產費，按照每年之實收數量算出，乘上等級别或地方别之指數，卽可算出各地方之標準生產費。本此標凖，更依各地米榖之等級，以定各公差等之價格，如此卽與現實的生產費，相差不逺，雖現實之生產費與現實買進價格之間，必有多少不同，然對於米榖生產上，恰爲有利，而豐家亦甚希望也。何則？農民以普通之勤勉得平常以上之收穫時，則各個之現實生產費低落，扣除買進價格，可得特别勤勞之報酬，反之，如此普通爲懶惰，不能得通常之收穫之農家，因减收而高現實之生產費，故因專賣，可以促進農業之發達，與農家之勤勉與努力。（二）收買的範圍，此卽買進數量問題。換言之，農家之生產米榖中，以如何範圍爲度收買歟！主張專賣論者，分爲二說，一爲全部收買說，將農家所有出產米榖，完全買進，卽農家自用米榖，亦與一般市民同樣，欲需用時再賣售與農家。一爲一部收買說，卽扣除農家自用米榖，將其餘剩者收買。第一說由農家經濟上觀之，查今日農村窮乏之大原因，因農家經濟漸次將本來之性質，爲資本主義的貨幣經濟所浸潤，專賣制度，可以防遏此弊端，但農家出產米榖之全部，一旦賣盡，日後再行買進自用米時，農家經濟，勢必舉其全部，而爲貨幣化，則與農村更生政策，大相矛盾，故主張第二說之一部收買，扣除農家自用米榖，卽可防止農村貨幣化。惟對於自家用米榖，扣下的數量，依各農家而不同，决定分量，又極困難，故須就國民消費總數，與每人應消費之數量，先有預定的統計，比例生產與供給數量，以及家計預算等，苟所預測之消費米榖，不能完全止確，萬一因預測之錯誤，以致米榖有剩餘時，則充於第一年度之消費，至若預測過少時，則更無問題矣。（三）買進的時期，當以常時買進爲最　宜。蓋農家經濟之理想，以收穫米榖之大部分，除年間應用貨幣之貨外，隨時依照分量出售。但此種方法，專賣事務，不惟遇於煩雜，目須多耗配給費用，故各國學者多主張分期收買。譬如分十一二月與二三月六七月等三次買進。然買進之時期應在買進價格决定緩行之，目應在全國實收數量確定之後。實收數量之發表，各國多在每年一月底，一方斟酌全國最遲收穫期，與最早收穫期，其問價格雖有差異但專賣機關可就上年度之情形，通盤規定，蓋實行專賣制度時，米榖價格，多無受季節的變動影響，故在一年間，可以固定價格。（四）收買機關在今日社會狀况之下，各省各縣應分設米榖檢查機關，直屬於中央專賣局，該機關專司各省内米榖之生產及消費，需要及供給輸入及輸出，進倉與出倉等事務，報告於中央·專賣局根據其報告，所得之資料，一可爲規定價格之參考，二可爲調濟數量之流通。（四）賣出價格，買進價格，旣已法定，則賣出價格之决定，可就全國的標準配給費，加上專賣事務經費，定出廣義的生產費，但使每年之生產費，發生變動，然國家爲安定米榖價格起見，可用技術的方法緩和之，不使因豐歉而變更宣出價格。雖各省的生產物，如米榖之品質等給運輸，以及其他費用等，大不相同，若己經各省詳細調查其現實生產費後，則與標準價格相差無幾。同時爲顧慮相會政策起見，應　和國民下層生活，將上第米提高價格，下級米低减價格，如對窮苦小民，認爲有旅米必要時，則應特别廉賣。（六）分配方法，務必以各地方之自給自足主義爲原則。然此國各地，因交通不便，米榖價格，常因爲地理的逺近關係所左右。譬如江蘇無錫常熟等縣其輸出外省者，佔十分之六七，專賣　度除以省縣單位定自給外，並須顧及其他產米較少之鄉村地方，調節生產過多與消費不足。固時對於分配費用，力謀節約，運用合理的圓滑的手段，惟分配米榖，須先將全國各省縣之生產消費情形，調查明確，以及外米輸入情形熟悉後，俾能按照數量隨時流通也。</p>
<h3 id="c235">日本銀行業之動向譚秉文 <a href="#c235" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e235" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">235</a></h3>
<p>我國銀行事業，就上海一隅以論，頗見蓬勃之旬，新行也，分行也，不以百業衰落而稍受影響，此其現象爲止則爲變態，以及銀行制度之是否健全，及應如何設法改善之處，國内學者亦早有所見。日本產業革命較諸猷美各人國爲晚，其國情與我尤頗多吻合，用特介紹其銀行業之現狀與動向，以資關心我國銀行業者借鏡焉。</p>
<p>出界大戰後，各國銀行俱有集中的傾向，其步驟有二：一爲大銀行吞併小銀行，二爲大規模銀行間之自行合併，與戰前諸小銀行之合併異其趣。此種趨勢，在日本亦有之。自昭和一年（一九二九）春金融恐慌爆發，益使日本銀行集中之勢燄愈熾。蓋華爾街證劵風潮餘波所及，日本銀行中之資力弱小與辦理不善者，因放欵之不易收回，信用减削，發生儲金逃避現旬，借貸雙方機能爲之障礙，營業日難，而倒閉者甚夥。</p>
<p>於是次年一月一日有現行銀行法之頒布，銀行制度爲之丕變。新法中規定，各銀行資本金額最少限度以百萬元以上爲原則。而特别規定「設有總行或支行於特定地域丨指東京大阪丨，其資金不得在二百萬圓以下。一尚有一條云：（在人口未滿一萬之地域，現己執行業務之銀行，應於本法施行後五年内增資至五十萬圓以上。一新條例旣見諸實施，中小銀行合併與收買之過程日益急進。試觀所謂五年準備期間將滿之際（昭和七年末）大藏省之報告卽可窺見斑。據該報告，銀行新法施行之前，普通銀行總數計一二八三行，不及法定資金者六一七行，約占半數，其中增資而得繼續營業者五十行，餘或合併或解散，五年間全部消滅。同期間所謂及格銀行而合併者，亦達數百行之衆。迨本年一月十日，存在者僅五三八行。</p>
<p>在此大淘汰運動中，普通銀行資金亦顯示非常變化。昭和二年末此類銀行一二八二家合計資金二十三億六千四百餘萬，每行平均額爲百八十四萬三千圓。至本年一月十日五百三十八行合計資金十九億一千餘萬（普通銀行資金之减少原因下述之），每行達三百五十五萬六千圓。換言之五年間行數减少百分之六十，而每行平均資本則增加百分之九十。</p>
<p>去銀行之業務其大要者有二：受人信用與授人信用是也。受人信用，或稱被動的業務，以存欵爲主。授人信用，或自動的業務，以放欵投資爲主。故吾人檢計日本銀行業之進行狀况，亦可從兩方面着手。兹先就受人信用方面研究之，而將金融恐慌前昭和元年末與本年六月末，日本各種銀行之儲金額，列表如左。（單位百萬圓日金）</p>
<p>種類　昭和元年末　本年六月末　備考</p>
<p>特别銀行　一、五四五　一、二六一　咸二八五</p>
<p>普通銀行　九、一七四　八、六一八　减五五六</p>
<p>儲蓄銀行　一、０六七　一、七六六　增六九九</p>
<p>信託公司　五、七七八　六、四二四　增六四六</p>
<p>郵政儲金局　　四二三　一、二六二　增八二五</p>
<p>其他　　　一、一九九　二、七五六　增一、五五七</p>
<p>上表中，特别銀行一項因其存欵多爲政府基金，姑作别論。惟他種銀行間之變動，則結果至爲明顯：在普通銀行方面則减少，而儲蓄銀行則大有增加，信託公司及郵政儲金之增加尤足驚人。夷老厥由，因日本國民經濟發達而自然增加者雖亦有之，惟普通銀行之資金逃遁於儲蓄銀行信註公司郵政儲金之數亦必甚夥，此實爲毫無可疑之事。</p>
<p>信託事業之突飛猛進尤值得吾人注意。日本信託公司之創設於大止十二年末，迨本年六月底，爲時約十一年，而資金己達六、四一四０００、０００圓。至於郵政儲金額之增加，據日本遞信省之觀察，多係來自銀行（以普通銀行爲主）之活期存欵項下者，達七八億圓。儲蓄銀行存欵之增加，則因此等銀行與比較大之銀行屬有資本系統，故信用頗稱雄厚，而得蠶食普通銀行之存欵。</p>
<p>特别銀行存欵之减損，蓋由於日本政府財政膨脹所致。普通銀行儲金之銳減，則除上述他種銀行之競爭外，投機事業之興盛實係其中重要之因素，在此情况之下，人民以銀行利息過低，而投資於公債，社債，地產股票等等交易也。因此而逃避之資金，其數必不較逃向儲蓄銀行及其他銀行者遜。</p>
<p>無論何種組織俱有其經濟的背景，日本此種銀行之變化，實其全國經濟之反映。如信託事業之發展，係内資產階級大額儲金增加的結果。至於郵政儲金儲蓄銀行資金的流入，則多係零星的大衆儲金。從前因特種銀行規模綦小或未創辦，故無論大額或小額存欵，俱寄存普通銀行。惟經濟情况越進展，則必有　合於新需要之銀行發生，故資金從舊組織中各流向其適宜之處所。此猶乎產業未發達之國，階級界限不明顯，迨產業越發達，階級分越逺，故吾人可預言，如日本經濟不破產，則此種資金分化之現象，今後更有激烈之傾向也。</p>
<p>在上述情形下，不僅普通銀行因外部關係而發生儲金之異動而己，卽普通銀行間亦發生變化卽儲金從較小資本之銀行偏集於資本較雄厚之銀行是也。蓋大規模的普通銀行，大都設有總行於大都會，張其支行　於全國，其放欵，投資，存欵及其他業務俱易於執行也。</p>
<p>次就銀行之授信業務覘之，亦有顯著之變化。無論在放欵或投資方面，大額交易俱日益興盛，此種傾向在大銀行之業務中尤特别顯著。至於小額交易之數雖亦有日增之勢，惟平均每宗交易額則反有减小，此兩傾向實與上述資金之異動與偏集有莫大關係。然其决定的因素厥惟所謂資金需要之大宗化，而此大宗化之成因則又爲事業界之進展與統制，以及因財政膨脹而起之公債之增發。</p>
<p>銀行業必須以大宗收入融通於大宗之事業方爲有利，如此不但可省種種麻煩手續與營業費。且因大宗之放欵或投資其確定性較大丨融資之對象與其事業之内容易於調查丨故此等游資過剩之大銀行，無論揆諸銀行之理論或實際，俱以用於大宗交易爲宜。至於中小錢行，因資力薄弱，不能投資大宗欵項以與大錢行競爭故不得不努力於廣闊的小宗交易，惟結果殊不能使之滿意：交易的數目雖增而其内含反减少。如此銀行授信業務之分化，勢必同時惹起儲金之分化。</p>
<p>世界經濟恐慌程度日深，各國財政膨脹之勢日烈，所謂加答兒托辣之獨占事業與統制政策採用亦越廣，公私事業俱需要大額欵項，從而大舉行之業務，發揮其能力，而中小銀行因而陷於不能應付之境。小銀行爲謀自身之出路，不得不積極作合併（Ａborplion之試騐。卽大銀行間亦爭爲大宗優良之放欵與投資，而訴諸優勝劣敗之法則，實行，合同式的人事併。一</p>
<p>歐美各國銀行合併，半世紀以來絶對盛行。至大銀行問之合併或合體（Ａmalgamalion），則自大戳後始興。（請參看銀行週報十七卷二十一期「銀行合併論」。）其在日本，進程亦毫無二致。其不同者，蓋因一國之銀行制度必五特殊的經濟基礎。如英國產業革命發生最早故銀行制度之演進（合併之過程）亦最早，故至一九二五年「五大銀行」之資金己占全國銀行資金百分之七十左右。日本銀行合併之程度較之殊爲遜色（見左表），蓋因日本國内，多數之中小產業及農業尚占比較重要之地位故也。惟日本之奔向銀行集中途上，亦殊迅速。如上述，昭和元年底日本銀行計一二八三所，迨乎本年頭竟减至五百三十八行，而最近三十四，山口，鴻池三大銀行之合併（合同式的），尤破日本銀行業之紀元。兹將本年一月底大觀省全國銀行調查列表如左。</p>
<p>行别　行數　總資金額單（位千元）</p>
<p>百萬元以下　一四七　七九、七八</p>
<p>二百萬元以下　二一四　二三八、八五七</p>
<p>五百萬元以下　九四二四九、五三五</p>
<p>千萬元以下　三八　二四一、九六七</p>
<p>三千萬元以下　三七　四八六、八七九</p>
<p>五千萬元以下　一　三三、九八八</p>
<p>五千萬元以上　七　五七九、七００</p>
<p>合計　五三八　一、九一０四六一</p>
<p>右述之資本金五千元以上之七大銀行十四與山口已於最近合併，故實際已成銀行，其餘資金雖僅爲普通銀行之總資　　　分三十强。然若以千萬元爲基礎。則二不及　之中小銀行尚有四百九十三行，占普通銀行數百分之九十强。此等銀行資金旣若是薄弱，其不適合於新環境之需要也顯然。今者美俄復交，國際情勢於日本頗爲不利，日本政府官預防萬一計，再行膨脹財政以擴充軍備實爲必然。目日本内部統制事業亦越益擴大。凡在種種，俱有需於大宗欵項。換言之，日本金融界中資力雄厚者投資處所越益擴大，而資力弱小者越感困難。在此情况下其將步英國之後塵實可預言。</p>

<p>— 屈軼</p>
<p>易繫辭曰：「闔户謂之坤，闢户謂之乾；一闔一闢，謂之變。往來不窮，謂之通。一又曰：「窮則變，變則通。」故所謂變者，乃以求其通也。刳木以爲舟，剡木以爲楫；舟與楫，木之變者也舟楫之利以濟不通，致逺以利天下。上古穴居而野處，後世聖人，「易」之以宮室；而今之摩登男女，得有跳舞之場，以跳其華爾兹舞。上古結繩而治，後世「易」之以書契，百官以治，萬民以察；而今之文人，得藉之以打筆墨官司。易者變也。易與變，皆所以求其通也。惟古人之變，必求通於天地萬物隂陽寒暑之情，今人之變，必求合於歷史的自然法則，其詞二，其義則一也。</p>
<p>有人焉，闔户讀書，浸潰典籍之間，而不知倦：每以户外之喧囂，爲塵俗，不可向邇。一旦，風吹户闢，信步外出；覺目之所接，手之所觸，有足多者。方知人情練達，即爲文章。恍然悟其人之所以爲人者，不覺手之舞之，足之蹈之矣。而我又斤斤然詬之曰：「汝固厭塵嚣者，今乃蹈舞於塵囂之中，汝之變，可謂不知恥矣」是亦少所見，多所怪，見駱駝，言馬腫背，太不知通變之理矣。</p>
<p>莊子曰：「種有幾，得水則爲㡭；得水土之際，則爲鼃蠙之衣：生於陵屯，」</p>
<p>則爲陵舄。」其名物不足徵，其義甚可取，蓋物莫不隨水土之宜，以變其生。由卵，而幼虫，而蛹，而成虫，此昆虫之生長過程也。稍有科學常識者。夫人而知之。然其變化，亦可謂繁頤矣。而我又復執幼虫成虫，而詬之曰：「汝固卵也，今乃以幼虫現；汝固蛹也，今乃以成虫顯。」其有不貽笑於虫子虫孫者乎。</p>
<p>然言爲心聲。言之所至，心之所止也。詩曰：「螟蛉有子，蜾贏負之。」鄭玄箋曰：「蒲盧（即蜾蠃）取桑虫之子，負持而去，煦嫗養之，以成其子。」陶弘景本草註與程瑶田釋虫小記，皆反此說。謂蜾蠃乃蜂之一種，築泥室於屋際，生子其中，而捕青虫（即所謂螟蛉也）以飼之。夫「蜾蠃之子」，得飼而長，長而銳化爲蜾蠃，此自然之變化，無足奇者。而詩人必指之爲螟蛉之子。楊雄法言，又從而增益之曰：「螟蛉之子殪，而逢蜾蠃，祝之曰：「類我！類我！」久則」</p>
<p>肖之矣。」則不以「蜾蠃之子」化蜾蠃爲然者，其有楊雄之遺恨歟？謂其不類我也。</p>
<p>余有感夫今之人以善變詈人，而不以歷史的自然法則，衡其變爲如何者；作說變。</p>
<h3 id="c243">方巖紀靜 <a href="#c243" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e243" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">243</a></h3>
<p>— 郁達夫</p>
<p>方巖在永康縣東北五十里，自金華至永康約百餘里，有公共汽車可坐，從永康至方巖就非坐轎或步行不可，我們去的那天，因爲天隂欲雨，所以在永康下公共汽車後就都坐了轎子，向東前進。十五里過金山村，又十五里到芝英，是一大鎭，居民約有千户，多應姓者，停轎小息，雨愈下愈大了，就買了些油紙之類，作防雨具。再行十餘里，兩旁就有起山來了，峯巖奇特，老樹縱横，在微雨裏望去，形狀不一，轎夫一一指示說：「這是公婆巖，那是老虎巖，……老鼠梯」等等，說一大串，又數里，就到了巖下街，己經是在方巖的脚下了</p>
<p>凡到過金華的人，總該有這樣的一個經騐。在旅館裏住下後，每會有些若青布長衫，文質彬彬的鄉下先生，來盤問你，「是否去方巖燒香的？這是第幾次來進香了？從前住過那一家？」你若回答他說是第一次去方巖，那他就會拿出一張名片來，請你上方巖去後，到這一家去住宿。這些都是巖下街的房頭，像旅店而又略異的接客着。逺　數百里外，就有這些派出代理人來兜攬生意，一則也可以想見一年到頭方巖香市之盛，一則也可以推想巖下街四五百家人家，</p>
<p>競爭的激烈。</p>
<p>巖下街的所謂房頭，經營旅店業而專靠胡公廟吃飯者，總有三五千人，大半係程應二姓，文風極盛，財產也各可觀，房子都係三層樓。大抵的情形，下層係建築在谷裏，中層沿街，上層爲樓，房丨一家總有三五十間，香市盛的時候，聽說每家都患人滿。香客之自紹興處州杭州及近縣來者，爲數固己不少，最逺者，且有自福建來的。</p>
<p>從巖下街起，曲折再行三五里，就上山；山上的石級是數不清的，密而且峻，盤旋環繞，要走一個鐘頭，纔走得到胡公廟的峯門。</p>
<p>胡公名則，字子正，永康人，宋兵部侍郎，常奏免衢鹬婺二州民丁錢，所以百姓感德，立廟祀之。胡公少時，曾在方巖讀過書，故而廟在方巖者爲老牌眞貨。且時顯靈異，最著的，有下列的數則：</p>
<p>宋徽宗時，寇略永康，鄉民避寇於方巖，巖有千人坑，大藤懸掛，寇至緣藤而上，忽見赤蛇嚙藤斷，寇都墜死。</p>
<p>盜起清溪，盤踞方巖，首魁夜夢神飲馬於巖之池，平明池涸，其徒驚潰。</p>
<p>洪楊事起，近鄉近村多遭刦，唯方巖無恙。</p>
<p>民國三年，嵊縣鄉民，慕胡公之靈異，造廟祀之，乘昏夜來方巖盜胡公頭去，欲以之造像，公夢示知事及近鄉農民，屬捉盜神像頭者，盜盡就逮。是年冬間嵊縣一鄉大火，凡預聞盜公頭者皆燒失。翌年八月該鄉民又有二人來進香，各斃於路上。</p>
<p>類似這樣的奇蹟靈異，還數不勝數，所以一年四季，方巖香火不絶，而尤以春秋爲盛，朝山進香者，絡繹於四方數百里的途上。金華人之逺旅　鄉者，各就其地建胡公廟以祀公，雖然說是迷信，但感化威力的廣大，實在也出乎我們的意料之外。這是就方巖的盛名所以能逺播各地的一近因而說的話，至於我們的不逺千里，必欲至方巖一看的原因，却在牠的山水的幽靜靈秀，完全與别種山峯不同的地方。「未完」</p>

<p>— 盛煥明</p>
<p>幼年留下的印象，能較清晰地，雕在我腦裏的還以夏天的爲多。那種使人混身長滿痱子的酷熱，十個指甲裏全藏滿了污垢的毒蚊奇癢，都不易使我淡忘。</p>
<p>夜晚，大家坐在熱烘烘的石階上或是門檻上乘凉，蚊了嗡嗡地哼，旱烟管的火在暗中一明一滅着。逺逺的，夏晚的薰風悠悠地夾了稻子的氣息把車水聲轆轆地飄送過來。當别人漫談時我就坐在一邊孤寂地搔着紅疙瘩沉沉地聽。所談的不外長毛「搜山」·「養身地」出殭屍一類故事，使人又厭又怕。屋裏的熱未退盡，跨進門檻就可聽到汪汪的蚊吟。鼻耳嘴無論什麽地方都會給蚊羣捕擊：如果獨自　兒朝湖邊走，人們會說：</p>
<p>「明哥兒，看見嗎？楊柳樹下一個水鬼丨紅頭毛·」</p>
<p>就給駭回來了。</p>
<p>可是夏夜給我的不一定是彷徨，只要有人說句「捉魚啊！」我就會興奮起來。</p>
<p>不過捉魚的事並不常有，阻碍有二：門外這口湖就是雨水少的年頭都不大會「分井」；（老年人說有幾處是没底的）頭年蕩進湖的「種魚」到那時候最多只三四斤重，太捉很了到冬天就會没大魚可網，這是不可以的。</p>
<p>然而也不見得就没有夏天捉魚的這回事。也會有：這大概總在月夜。鑼聲嚮了起來，拿了「搗」（註）的人們成羣地涉進白菱湖，嘩呀嘩呀地捉到大半夜。</p>
<p>這種難得的捉魚，老年人還少不了要表示他們的不滿：</p>
<p>「看吧，這「世界」「一定要變！」咪脪眼的貴叔勞叨着：「一定要變，不拿到城裏去賣，却……早年不到冬天是不准捉魚的，這世界！」</p>
<p>「死「老貨」！」我嘴裏𠼫着個魚頭躱在�</p>
<p>門背後駡，心想：「這些東西死完了那末就可以天天捉魚了！」</p>
<p>去年的夏天返了一次故鄉，在湖沿上碰見他，巳老得不成樣。他把旱烟管碰着一顆老柳樹抖索着唇：「老了，不中用了，這些東西！」搓着那雙給勞作龜裂了的大枯手，對那些打魚的人們楞着。</p>
<p>或在湖沿上，或在竹筏上，或在淺水中，人們撒着網，或用别的捕魚具捕着魚。憑着自己的運氣捉着魚。白菱湖捕魚的漣漪互相撞擊着。湖水都給變成死色了。</p>
<p>「早年丨唉，眞是長毛手上都没有過，你讀書人，明白的，書上有夏天可以這樣打魚的話嗎？丨没有的，變了！」</p>
<p>不久我就明白過來：傍晚，或是太陽將透土的時候，我看見他們把打到的魚漾在木臉盆裏或是用柳條穿在魚鰓裏進城了。回來時，他們帶回些連貧窮都不可少的必需東西，白菱湖顯然是他們救急的唯一財源。</p>
<p>離開故鄉時是冬天，白菱湖顯然己搜羅不到魚。</p>
<p>「該凑點錢買「魚種」了！」或有人說。大家默着。</p>
<p>註：「搗」，方音。一種竹編的捕魚器。高約三尺餘，圓形。以此揷入水底，如發覺有魚則從上面伸下手去捉</p>

<p>可是突然他像從夢中醒來了似的，他清楚地看出了他們；因爲他們像是幸福且滿足的緣故，他忽然對他們起着一種怨恨。</p>
<p>他現在一面從那一堆一堆的人旁擦過，在他們周圍打着圈子，一面又沉浸在一些新的思想裡。那些像花束一樣蓋滿沙灘的五光十色的裝飾，那些漂亮的衣料，那些耀目的遮陽傘，那些不自由的身軀的不自然的嬌媚，從粗緻的鞋子直到怪特的帽子的一切時行式樣的匠心的發明，那姿勢，聲音和微笑的誘惑，總之，一切陳列在這沙灘上的艶裝媚態，使他突然覺得像是一片盛放着的女性惡德之花。這一切妝得花花緑緑的女人，都想取悅，誘惑並鈎引什麽人。她們是爲着男人，一切男人！祇除去再用不着征服的丈夫丨而妝得美麗的。她們是爲着今日或明日的情人，是爲着遇到的，注意到的，或期待着的不相識者而妝得美麗的。</p>
<p>而這些男人，坐在她們近邊，和她們四目相視，嘴唇隔得很近地談着，呌着她們，想要得到她們，雖然看去像是很近很易，但他們却像鬛逐着一隻伶俐狡猾的禽或獸一樣獵逐她們。然則這廣綿的海灘不過是一座愛情市場罷了，一部分女人在那襄出賣，另一部分在那裏奉送，這一些女人在那裏給自己的愛撫論價，那一些女人則在那裡以身相許。這一切的女人都祗想着那同一的事情，呈現並使得人家羨望她們那曾經給人過的，曾經出賣過的，曾經許諾給别的男子的肉體，於是他想到在全地球上，這事情是到處一樣的。</p>
<p>他的母親也不過和别的女人一樣幹過這把戲罷了！和别的女人一樣丨丨不！也還有例外的，並且很多，很多！他現在眼前見到的，是一些有錢的，熱狂的，追求愛情的女人，這些大概部是屬於那優　而浮華的社會裡的，或甚至是屬於賣淫的社會裡的，因爲在這被游手好閑之徒踐蹈着的海灘上，是遇不到那些深覻在自己家裏的優淑的女人的。</p>
<p>潮水漲了，把頭幾行的浴客慢慢地向城裡趕去。那一堆一堆的人看見那飾着一圈泡沫的黄色波壽衝上來時，便連忙立起身，拿着他們的椅子逃走了。那些駕着一匹馬的，可以轉動的換衣的小房子，也開上來了；在沿着海灘從這頭到那頭用木板鋪成的散步道上，現在擠滿了人，黑黝黝的，慢慢的動着，一股向東，一股向西，皮此肩摩踵接，混在一塊。神經過敏的筆爾，因爲和他們擦來擦去，焦燥起來，便逃開了他們，獨自跑進城裡，在一家簡陋的酒店門口停了脚，走進去午餐。</p>
<p>當他吃過飯喝了咖啡之後，他便在門外兩張椅子上仰臥起來，因爲他那晚上一點都没有睡過，他便在一株菩提樹下假寐了。</p>
<p>休息了幾點鐘之後，醒轉來時，己是應當趕回去搭船的時候了，於是他取道往埠頭走去，一路上頗爲那在假寐時很快地襲來的疲憊所苦。現在他想回去，想知道他母親有没有把瑪賴沙的肖像找出來。她會先提起這事呢，還是仍得要他再問一遍呢？假使她還要等别人去問起的話，那她一定有着一個不願把這肖像給人看見的秘密的理由。</p>

<h3 id="c246">戀愛拜金主義與享樂主義 <a href="#c246" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e246" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">246</a></h3>
<p>— 瓊聲</p>
<p>戀愛自由己經在中國由討論而入於廣泛的事實的現在，己經没有多少人來注視；然而這并非是戀愛自由的「眞諦」已被人澈底領悟而行之不悖了，其所以闃然無聞，實在是有兩個極端的觀點在支配着人心，没有將性與愛，及物質與兩性精神的關係「把握」着，而形成了目前廣泛的浪漫的肉的享樂，與乎「誘姦不滿二十歳少女」遺棄不顧要求膽養費等民事訴訟普遍發生的現象。</p>
<p>這兩種現象都是以目前經濟破產作它的時代背景而表現出來的。要根本解决自然是要從改變目前經濟狀况及造成經濟破產的社會組織，而没有正確了解性與愛，精神與物質的關係，并在這一認識中來盡一點「人事」，也不能不說是兩性關係愈趨惡劣的原因。其所以没有正確了解性與愛，精神和物質的關係丨即兩性關係的純萃拜金主義，和簡單以性慾爲一切兩性關係的機械主義。</p>
<p>在代表民族獨立運動的民主革命的「五四」後不久，隨着搬來了戀愛自由離婚結婚自由的名詞，那時中國雖然同樣受帝國主義的侵略，但社會經濟破產逺不如現在，因此一般經濟地位不上不下的智識份子，曾倡導過一時「戀愛神聖」，然而近年來中國經濟在世界經濟恐慌影響，各列强的加緊掠奪下，己大大的破產，這一批隨之没落的中小階層男女，便趨於戀愛的拜金主義，與乎以性慾作中心愛即性慾的機械主義。前者在他們或她們的處世，閱歷中，以金錢魔力最大，便毫不顧及感情見錢是愛的將身體整個或零碎的出賣以後者便以性慾爲一切，企圖一時對於現實的麻醉，隨在的以浪漫爲事。前者是醉心於作金融鉅子財閥大王太太小姐的玩物，後者「今朝有酒今朝醉」，希圖以樂忘憂的態度，然而兩者都是中間階層没落的反映。固然有少數的人時來運來堂堂的作了太太或裙帶官兒，但大多數在數度問津之後，就棄如敝履，見之公堂也不過爲律師多添幾筆出庭費，甚至有不少作了黄浦江頭的寃鬼與華安大樓自殺的主演人物。至於純性慾享樂的倡行者，不管臨時與短期的「馬馬虎虎」，不但不能在陶醉之後忘去視實，其精神上亦必感受痛苦原因爲　　人竟是個血肉的感情動動。　　在經濟破產的現在，戀愛拜金主義的產生，自然是中間階層向敵投降的表現，在你有錢我有色的觀點下，實行肉體的出買，有害於兩性關係的正確發展自不用說，但肉的享樂主義亦逺非前進的意識。名人引用唯物的見地來爲之辯護，認爲「愛即是性慾」乃唯物的認識，其害處遂不减於向敵投降。除了將人的關係機械引用唯物來證辨的庸俗見解外，并且直接的助長了沉醉於肉的享樂規避現實的有害現象。在我們非難戀愛的拜金主義，一些意志薄弱受金錢的誘惑而失身失志的人，在目前錢可通神的環境下本屬當然，無所置議，而根本的癥結，在於金錢集於　份人手裏「戀愛自由」之必被利用爲慾的縱樂的病態現象。</p>
<p>因此，我們固然不贊同戀愛的拜全主義，與乎肉的享樂主義，但應看作爲經濟現象社會現象使然，腰無長物，不能供給愛人進跳舞塲電影院的朋友，也大可不必「如喪考妣」的閙其失戀，只當進先施公司看了定價高昻的「南腿」，不敢問津就會爽然。眼見開旅館進跳舞塲的享樂現象，更滿用不着大嘆其「世風日下，人心不古」，因爲它亦會隨着時代的前進而没落。</p>
<p>有人說，世到而今，長婦姹女，爭競侈邪，戀愛自由，誨淫致亂，其實皆偏激之談；見錢眼開，出賣肉體大不在乎的現象，與不知人間事的陶醉於享樂中的事實，其發生乃必然，其消滅亦不可避免，非道德家關心風化大聲疾呼之所能爲力也。</p>

<p>— 右夷</p>
<p>前天看見有位署名（愼敏）君的一段「訪友須知」的文章·指的是拜訪要人們，須要知道的方法：到也十分痛快，不過旣指明拜訪要人，道訪友的「友」字，似乎還不大相宜，因爲要人自然　人人都想　識做個朋友的：然領他都未必肯輕輕認你是朋友，這個「友」字，不經對方許可，怕不能成立吧；　使你是在他未曾升官發財以前就認識他，和他狠熟，他硬賴不脫身，我料他對於你的尊稱，至少限工，也要在朋友兩字上，加一個窮：逢人便說，是從前的窮朋友，你聽聽，這窮字多難爲情，還是取銷這頭銜，來得干凈：所以我把這題目改爲「求人要訣」再來補充幾句，好在現在社會上，除了挾有長槍的人講硬打，懷着手槍的人講硬搶以外，没有不求人可以生存在世界上的，求人要訣，不可不知。據我看來，也很容易，不外乎「吹牛」「拍馬」先從談話一科來入門：歡喜嫖的，和他談些嫖經，觀喜賭的，和他講些賭法，再有嘴裏不愛講這一套，要研究學問，注重人才，來沽名鈎譽的，你便臉白均曾在東洋西洋鍍金鍍銀回來，學問專長，藝精絶技，拍他己大政治家大經濟衆大教育家，只要吹　倉度　　　得當，或是再加　　夜色　　　　　定　　得要人歡心　　　　　　得官，</p>

<p>求財得財，從心所欲，豈不是不亦樂乎嗎。但是還有兩點求人最忌的，也不可不知。第一點，如若你所求的要人，從前微賤時候，你曾接濟過或提拔過他，切忌舊事重提，在你以爲表示恩惠，感發他的良心，殊不知要人們體面要緊，最怕揭破昔日短處，你若定要說穿，他那時惱羞成怒，翻轉面孔，必定恩將仇報。第二點，如若你所求的要人，大擺架子成大施教訓，切忌忍受不了，必須要平心靜氣含著笑臉，誠心領教，這正是好表現恭維態度的機會，不可錯過，况且旣有求於人，事實上是需要他做你謀差事的工具，譬如耕者需牛，騎者需馬，如此設想，一定會心平氣和，不會閙一些意氣，講一些氣節了。</p>

<p>大自然，給予牠的慘酷的脅迫！牠又怎樣去抵抗呢？牠悲傷了！牠恐懼了！力竭擊嘶地，唱着持斃的哀鳴！啊小虫！你們來向這夜行道上的人們！乞憐，是錯誤了，你們知道麽？在這寒風刺骨的，冷的秋夜，當貴的人們，他是早早嚴開了雙扉，鑽入了和暖的被中，做他甜密的夢了，不怕風寒露冷而在路上走着的！如我！他們都是和你們！小虫！一樣命苦的勞動者啦！我告訴你聽，他們的環境，他們的周遭，同樣的和你們一樣的悲慘，可憐，身上一件蔽被的單衣，怎像去抵抗大自然的凶暴呢？寒冷的冬天，他又怎樣地挨過呢？所以，他也深深地，感覺悲傷，恐懼，不過爲了罩了虚僞的恥羞的面具，不好像你們一樣的，聲嘶力竭地，去發着哀鳴吧？</p>
<p>爲了這樣，你們的求援，還是向富貴的爺們去懇求吧！但，爺兒們的心腸，是個個鐵打的！他們對於站在一條線的，同類的窮人，還不肯來加以援助，那麽，那里還來同情你們啦！所以，我看來，你們要求他的希望，是渺茫的，是没有實現的可能性的，還是像我一樣地抱定「自靠自」的主義吧！小虫，快些起來，奮鬥，求你們的生存，假使你們至死不悟地，仍舊乞援他人，而哀鳴，那麽，結果，唯有引頸就刑哩！</p>

<p>晚上，吃過了晚飯，閑談了一會，斌像元寳似地，抱了能四歳的兒子子剛，說：</p>
<p>「乖！乖！你今天原去陪着祖母睡</p>
<p>；祖母的床頭有很好吃的東西；去罷；祖母在等着你去吃呢？」斌好似喃喃地禱告。</p>
<p>但是，孩子却嚷着說：不去，今天晚上我要陪着媽。」</p>
<p>斌皺了皺眉毛，苦着臉望着玲。</p>
<p>「怎麽辦？這孩子便這麽倔强！」</p>
<p>妻笑着臉坐在一旁，看着斌發急的神情，不覺抿嘴一笑，向他瞟了一眼。斌用手拍着了剛的背，又哄着說：</p>
<p>「去罷！乖乖！祖母在呌你哩？你以前幾天陪着祖母睡，祖母很歡喜你；你不去，祖母便不愛你啦！」</p>
<p>「阿囝去罷！你爸爸在發急哩！」玲調笑似地輕淡描寫的說上一句。</p>
<p>「不去，不去，我要媽媽……孩子還是搗亂，業是嚷着，兩隻小手，在斌的臉上，亂拍亂打。</p>
<p>「這小傢伙，便這樣不識好歹！」斌氣極了！發了怪反孩子向沙發上一摜，於是孩子高聲哭起來啦！</p>
<p>放手之後，又後悔自己太孟浪了！斌斜眼睨着玲的臉，只見她冷冰着臉說：</p>
<p>「你何不便把他摜死了？落得個清靜：我知道你不需要兒女的了！」</p>
<p>「笑話，你看這孩子多麽可惡！我道麽的百哄百順，他還要道樣地搗亂？……」</p>
<p>「哼！百哄百順，要顧自己的快活，便不顧我的孩子了！」</p>
<p>「眞是笑話！他不也是我的孩子？」</p>
<p>「那末，你爲什麽要這樣對待她？」</p>
<p>「得啦！算我不好·好吧……」</p>
<p>玲呶着嘴不理他，跑到沙發邊，抱起了子剛：</p>
<p>「阿囡！不要哭，聽媽的話，今天陪祖母去睡；明天媽買小洋槍給你玩」</p>
<p>「我還要一匹小馬。」孩子笑起來了！</p>
<p>一天的事，風消雲散；孩子照例由斌領到祖母的洋房中，回來時正見妻在疊着被，她回過臉來說：</p>
<p>「你看你自己的牛性子，還要怪孩子的倔强，搗亂：怎麽我一來，她便乖乖的肯去了？……」說着，她抿着嘴笑了起來。斌也笑了起來。</p>

<p>柏拉圖說：「人類社會是一個大舞台。」我們天天祗瞧看前台的笑臉，却没有明瞭後台的種種。藝人在舞台上表演的喜劇？就是整個的人生。假使我們把幕後的背景揭開，這裏有物質的奴隸，被壓迫的眼淚。瞧吧，那個小丑是扮裝着花臉從幕後跑出來給消遣的觀衆鬨懷了，他是永逺掛着微笑，或者正是他眼淚没有乾的時候。我們觀過郎却乃的ＬanghCrownＬangh和愛密爾雅寗的藍天使，所以契可夫對我們說過：「我們的同胞，正在各式各樣不同的洞裏爬出來。」</p>
<p>我且將舞台的背面剖白給諸位，小丑的脚色在一切角色之下，他僅僅用僱佣來扮了花臉在正脚色没有登塲之前調和觀衆的情調的。他呌着，跳着，講述各種可以博取人們一笑的故事。觀衆們笑了，他就能博取班主的歡心，所以他是永逺掛着笑臉，他的父母妻子兒女底命運完全繼繫在他的笑臉上。在笑聲裏面，在笑臉背面，誰知道是淚的結晶品呢？</p>
<p>有一個著名的小丑在歐羅巴洲，他因爲要研究小丑的藝術，他忘了對妻子應盡的義務，可是他的妻不能原諒也是個要博取觀衆和班主的歡心底小丑，他的生活是在笑臉上求生存的。終於在他扮着花臉笑着的時候，他的妻子留書出走了；然而這可憐的小丑，無論在他怎樣痛心要絶的含着眼淚，在前台他是永逺掛着笑臉的。要見小丑的淚嗎？請到後台去。</p>
<p>失業聲浪，充滿了耳畔的我們大中國，最近爲了二個小丑的死而把後幕揭開了。算來他們在職業範圍中有着根固的地位，他們每天跳着，呌着在博取觀衆和班主的歡心。然而一個横下來没有成殮的喪費，一個更有了生活壓迫而自殺。我們在前台天天瞧見他們的笑臉，後台在背景内却充滿了眼淚呢？</p>
<p>「人類社會是個大舞臺」。小丑的背景揭開了，不過在這個大舞臺上還有雖是扮着笑臉想博取觀衆和班主的歡心而没有結果的，我們的同胸啊，從各式各樣的洞中爬出來罷，到這大舞臺上來扮一個永逺掛着笑臉的小丑。</p>

<p>— 孟逺</p>
<p>翠是妻麗的同學，而且還是一對極好的好朋友，</p>
<p>在我没有同麗談愛之前，我同翠先進行了幾部戀愛之曲；可是終於我和翠的友誼冲談了！接着我便成爲麗唯一的俘虜。所以我同翠的過程，在麗的面前，是公開的秘密的。有時我說起翠有的地方不好，妻常會用頑皮口吻來調侃我說：「你的翠最好！」可是麗同翠的友誼，仍是保持着常態。</p>
<p>不料，有一次，却出乎例外了！我爲着無意中讚美了翠的幾句話，竟引起了「妻的教訓」。這是上月半的事，我曾爲文在上月二十八日，在本刋記載過。</p>
<p>現在再來追憶一件往事；這大約是在今年的春季：</p>
<p>妻身體有些不舒服，病了！我送她到火車站回鄉去養息之後，怪寂寞的要算是星期日了！有時候我雖然還能夠耐着心，孤單單的一個人，坐在家裏寫稿子；可是這寂寞終究離不了我這心頭，而且，更惦記着妻的病况，心中更是煩悶的了不得！於是頽廢的心緒，祗有慒然的向化錢的塲合去消遣。</p>
<p>當然也是一個最寂寞最煩悶的星期日的下午，我無意中在南京大戲院，碰到了翠，及翠的二個女友；售票處的門，是這麽的擁擠，翠向我笑了一笑，接着皺了皺眉頭；於是我自告奮勇，擠入了人羣，賣得了四張票子，我們便一起入座。</p>
<p>在未開映以前，翠輕輕的問我：</p>
<p>「麗爲什麽不同來？」</p>
<p>「因爲她身子不適，前星期到鄉下未休養去了！」</p>
<p>「怎麽？麗病了！我們好姊妹爲什麽不來通知一聲呢？」</p>
<p>隨後，銀幕上熱烈緊漲的動作，我們的談話，也就中止；到終場大家說聲再會，分别走了！</p>
<p>回到了家裏，我預備把遇見翠的事，在信上告訴給妻知道；可是一轉念　我想可以不必多此一舉了！也許妻會說我：「你對於翠的事，終是那麽關心」。　　於是祗告訴妻在南京看影戲，而却不提遇翠的那麽一回事。</p>
<p>四五天以後，妻的回信來了！劈頭便說：</p>
<p>「逺：</p>
<p>你爲什麽有些事情，終是那麽的喜歡不使我知道呢？你和翠的事，不是早</p>

<p>我瞧完了信，心中一陣汗顏，不禁有些懊悔起來：這不是我懊悔不該請翠看電影，這要怪我自己太和心了丨爲什麽不坦白地告訴妻呢？　　丨一自打洋心自吃苦」。該死，該死丨這一下，使親愛的　不知又要　顷分煩惱哩？</p>
<p>這天晚上，我費了二小時光隂，寫子四張稿　　仔仔細細的向妻作一　婉轉的解釋：以求她的諒解。</p>
<p>不多天，娶的　信來了，我急忙抽出來一口氣看完，於是　事便放下了一塊千斤的重石似地的，辦事也要心得多！了！</p>

<p>— 張老三</p>
<p>從鄉下逃出來，以爲上海總能容藏我；但是兩天之内，上海給與我的却太使我失望了。像我敏姊的敏姊，那同情我的伴侣，跑去天屬的樂園。舅父，那淡淡地把東西帶到這裏來罷。都市姑娘的表姊似乎熱戀着我。我僅僅鼓起的勇氣，從鄉下到上海，上海到旅館，旅館到方外别墅，方外别墅到電車上，己消滅的無影無蹤。歸去吧，我永逺不能離開我的弟弟，這意識襲上我心頭時，最好一步回到放鄉，然而丨我能悄悄地歸去嗎？我不怕鄰居的恥笑，但自願再跨進這樊龍，做上鈎的魚兒嗎？這時候我的思想，正如這電車一樣，來回地被鐵軌束縛着，奔，奔，倒底到那裏去？</p>
<p>弟弟，我說些什麽呢？</p>
<p>（十八）酒樓上</p>
<p>半路上任意地跳下電車，望着街心昏黄的街燈，整理我的步伐，一盞，二盞，無數盞，又是熱閙的上海市中心。</p>
<p>「酒」，一塊金字黑底的市招，在燈光下蕩洩着跳進我的眼簾，被擾亂了的神經好像須要牠的刺激，「去買醉吧」，自己不由主的踏上酒樓。在靠馬路佔了一張桌子，堂倌送上酒來後，我僅小小的喝了一口，擎起了酒杯，儘望着前面的馬路，伹是我能望見些什麽呢？上海熱鬧的市區，這時候對於我一如數百里不見人跡的大沙漠，這顆脆弱的心靈，能戰勝這樣的環境嗎？這裏没有太陽的美麗的笑容，有的是同一的人類，而不同人心的眼睛，那眼睛像汽車上的電炬一般可怕。我的前途，「可否再帶上一個毫無經騐毫無生產力的弟弟？」泰山似的問題擁湧上我心中，歸去保護我的弟弟，還是帶他到沙漠中來發掘清泉？</p>
<p>年虹鐙在對面閃耀着，汽車在馬路中心怒孔，背後樓梯上送來雜踏的歡悅的皮鞋聲，我估量是一　化錢本領驚人的學生，不知從什麽電影院瞧了肉感跳舞散塲，大嚼一頓後，再預備消遣不夜天的步驟。一時好像青春活躍的空氣，充　了小小的酒樓中，學校時代的浪漫生活裏恢復在我記憶裏，「總有你們年青人的機會啊！」慧姊的警句有力地收束了我散漫的思潮，忘形地擎起杯來，一口喝盡了巳凉的酒。</p>

<p>(Fuzhou) The Military Affairs Commission has issued a clear order to abolish the Mawei Naval Port Headquarters. The defense of the Changle area will still be the responsibility of Division Commander Yun Yinglin. Most of the Japanese warships of the "Kaze" class arrived in Mawei yesterday. All donation and tax collection agencies under the jurisdiction of Fuzhou and Ningde have been forcibly taken over by naval and army personnel. Many county magistrates have been replaced. The two merchant ships, the "Zhenbo" and "Jiangmen," sailing between Fuzhou and Sandu, have been detained, causing transportation disruptions. The authorities are currently trying to restore it.

Yesterday, three Nanjing airplanes flew to southern Fujian, passing over Quanzhou, Hui'an, and Xianyou. When several bombs were dropped in Quanzhou, the people were holding a meeting to celebrate the establishment of the new government. It is reported that the total number of deaths and injuries reached fifty people. The residents of the whole city were greatly shaken. It is rumored that Zhang Huichang has come to Fujian to direct air defense. According to Jiang Guangnai, the monthly tax revenue of Fujian Province is 2 million yuan. At the same time, an economic meeting is borrowing money from businessmen in Fuzhou, and it is rumored that only 84,000 yuan has been borrowed. The 19th Route Army is now deployed in western Fujian, and Cai Tingkai is currently inspecting northern Fujian. (3rd Reuters Dispatch)</p>

Guangdong Province plans to adopt a policy of defending its borders and protecting its people towards Fujian. (13th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Xiao Focheng issued a statement on the morning of the 3rd, saying that the widespread rumors outside that the Southwest will have another organization are not true. As for the so-called People's Government of Fujian, it is absurd.

<p>(Beiping) The Military Affairs Commission will hold an emergency meeting tomorrow morning to discuss the issue of military expenses in North China. (3rd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The proposals to be discussed by the Economic Supervisory Commission tomorrow morning are: A. Standards for reducing military pay in North China: soldiers will receive 90% of their monthly pay, lieutenants will receive 70% to 90%, field officers will receive 65% to 70%, and generals will receive 60%. B. Reduce a portion of the public funds for provisions and subsidize the monthly pay of soldiers in each army. C. Stipulate the average number of coordinated pay allocations in each place to ensure fairness. The new pay regulations can be implemented from January of next year. (3rd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Yu Xuezhong arrived in Beiping tonight. According to him, in addition to attending the Economic Supervisory Commission meeting on the 4th, he has no other tasks in Beiping. Regarding the issue of the reception of Shanhaiguan, the Japanese side stated that the puppet state agencies and the Japanese army must wait until the barracks outside the pass are built before withdrawing. Therefore, when it can be received is uncertain. The rumor that it can be received by the end of the year is inaccurate. The Japanese side requested that the outer city of the east gate of Shanhaiguan be assigned to the puppet state, which our side cannot allow. That place is no less than the east gate of Shanhaiguan. The Luanzhou Security Team under Liu Zuozhou mutinied with over 400 people, who were newly recruited. In addition, the troops of Zhao Lei and others were all newly recruited, ranging from 700-800 people or 300-400 people. The provincial government has issued 3,000 yuan to each unit, ordering them to disband quickly, and ordering each unit to implement the establishment according to what the provincial government has promised. The rumor that the provincial government ordered Tianjin to implement the election of a mayor next year is not true. The Economic Supervisory Commission will hold a meeting tomorrow morning to review the military pay allocation methods. (3rd Dispatch)</p>

The reason why Shanhaiguan could not be received at that time was that Ii had not been in office for long and was not clear about everything.

<h3 id="e10">Military Affairs Commission's Foreign Affairs Group Hosts Press Yesterday; Chen Chuxiong Reports Fujian Incident Will Not Affect Overall Situation <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>(Beiping) The Foreign Affairs Group of the Military Affairs Commission hosted the press at 11:00 AM on the 3rd. Group leader Chen Chuxiong reported, roughly stating that since the Fujian Incident occurred, there have been many rumors about the security of North China, which is an overreaction. Commissioners Huang and He are sitting in Beiping, and all military and political affairs are on track. Rumors are absolutely unbelievable. Some people are concerned that the Fujian Incident may expand and affect the overall situation, but in fact, the Fujian rebels only have a portion of the 19th Route Army, with a strength of no more than six divisions. Two divisions cannot be mobilized, and at least two divisions must defend Guangdong. At most, only two divisions will face Zhejiang. Zhejiang has sufficient military strength and a tight deployment. It is conceivable that the Fujian rebels have no possibility of development. Moreover, the 19th Route Army has always been divided into two factions: one is Jiang Guangnai, and the other is Cai Tingkai. The two factions cannot cooperate thoroughly. Moreover, there are still many old troops in Fujian Province, such as Lu Xingbang, which will greatly hinder the actions of the 19th Route Army. It can also be asserted that it will not expand and affect the overall situation. Reactionary elements in North China often use foreign concessions and the power of foreigners to organize secret agencies and publish reactionary news. Moreover, a certain country is afraid that China will not be in chaos and is deeply colluding, creating rumors to confuse the public. It is hoped that the press will have a clearer judgment on this situation before publishing it, so as not to be used by them. As for the Communist bandits in Jiangxi, their strength is at most 50,000, with no more than 10,000 rifles. They are easy to eliminate. However, due to the impact of the "September 18th" and "January 28th" incidents and the battles in North China, they have not been eliminated. However, the bandit army lost more than 10,000 in the first encirclement and suppression, another 5,000-6,000 in the second encirclement and suppression, and another 3,000-4,000 in the Yihuang area during the third encirclement and suppression. The strength of the bandit side has lost at least one-third or more and is now lingering on. Therefore, there was a slogan welcoming the 19th Route Army, but the 19th Route Army was coerced by Chen Mingshu of the Fujian rebels this time. They originally intended to use the Communist bandits, but the Communist bandits were unwilling to be used by them, so they are sincerely afraid that the entire 19th Route Army will become Communist bandits. Thinking of this, they regret the past glory of the army. (3rd Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Wu Heling discussed the Japanese setting up an autonomous region in Duolun, saying that after the loss of the three northeastern provinces and Rehe, Japan has always coveted western Mongolia and has constantly fabricated various rumors to confuse the Mongolian people. As for the establishment of an autonomous region, he has only seen it reported in the newspapers. When he left Mongolia, he had not heard of it. However, in Duolun, several months ago, Japan established the Chahar East Administrative Commissioner's Office, appointing Li Shouxin as the commissioner, in charge of everything, and brought an army of about 10,000 people. (3rd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) People from Rehe talked about the Mengqi organization in Rehe Province, which was originally 13 tribes and 20 banners from the Zhaowuda and Suosutu leagues. After the fall of Rehe Province, the puppet state forced changes to the original organization of the Mengqi, using the Xilamulun River basin as a boundary. Six of the eight tribes and thirteen banners of Zhaowuda and Suifeng in Hebei were divided into the Xing'an West Province, using the false name of Mongolian self-government to divide the unity of the Mongolian and Han ethnic groups. The six banners of the Zhaowuda League and the seven banners of the Suosutu League south of the Xilamulun River, because the Mongolian princes all unanimously refused and opposed the division of the autonomous region, the puppet government feared resistance from the Mongolians, so it temporarily designated the Xilamulun River as a mixed Mongolian-Han area to appease the Mongolian princes. Recently, Songshishi Xiaoliang, the director of the Chengde Special Service Agency, went to the Suosutu League to convene a meeting of Mongolian princes, still advocating to be placed under the jurisdiction of the Xing'an Province. The Mongolians consistently opposed. After deliberation, it was decided to establish a Mongolian Affairs Bureau in the area south of the Xilamulun River, directly under the Xing'an Province, to govern the Mengqi administration and transform the old system of the Mengqi in a disguised form.

<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Finance, in order to implement the system of unified government sales of saltpeter and sulfur by the Central Government in all provinces, but Hunan Province still being managed by merchants, has ordered the Hunan Saltpeter and Sulfur Bureau to be uniformly changed to government sales.

The plan is to first purchase the entire monthly output of sulfur and saltpeter from Shuikoushan at a publicly determined standard reserve price and find ways to sell it within and outside the province. The required capital is approximately 30,000 yuan, which will be allocated in installments from the salt tax item based on the actual number needed for deposit in the bank for use, etc. Since Hunan sulfur has been changed to government sales, all previously established Hunan Sulfur Transportation and Sales Offices and Hunan Sulfur Supervisors are no longer necessary and should be abolished.

The Ministry of Interior previously responded to a request for clarification from the Henan Civil Affairs Department. As for household surveys, they are based on the number of people currently living together as the members of the household, which is different from the scope of household registration limited to those who belong to the same household. Although concubines and child brides are not recognized legally, they cannot be used for household registration. However, when investigating households, for those who live in the same family with the purpose of permanent cohabitation, they may naturally be regarded as family members in accordance with the Civil Code and entered in the household survey form.

<h3 id="e29">Hirota's Pacific Peace Movement Fails <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>Japanese Foreign Minister Hirota is recently pouring his full energy into employing his peace-making skills. As the New York Evening Post put it, Japan's hope is "Japan's Peace in the Pacific." The paper also stated, "Japan has two hopes. One is to first maintain peace with Soviet Russia, requesting the Soviet Union to remove its military installations along the Russian border. Japan, in turn, plans to abolish its...</p>
<p>military installations in Japanese territory. The intention is precisely to secure the lands it has recently seized. The second is to hope to negotiate naval equality with Great Britain and...</p>
<p>the United States. Furthermore, it believes that China is currently facing many troubles in Fujian, providing an opportunity to take advantage of the tense situation in Europe to pit Soviet Russian interests against those of Great Britain and the United States, thereby reaping the benefits of the fisherman." The conclusion is that it hopes diplomats from various countries can, with astute skills, expose Japan's diplomatic schemes and not fall into their trap. This argument of the paper can be said to have insight into the current situation of the Japanese side. However, from our perspective, it is also overly...</p>
<p>concerned.</p>
<p>Because Foreign Minister Hirota's Pacific peace movement, if it were before the formal restoration of diplomatic relations between the United States and the Soviet Union, might still have had some...</p>
<p>chance of success. Now, no matter how subtle Hirota's skills may be, he has ultimately missed the opportune moment. The deadlock in relations between the United States and Russia over the past sixteen years has been a significant constraint on the diplomacy of both countries. After Japan's invasion and occupation of the four northeastern provinces, Russia demonstrated strength along the northern Manchurian border. However, Russia has consistently used peaceful means to deal with it, even proposing negotiations to sell the Chinese Eastern Railway and further reducing its price. The reason for dealing with Japan in such a perfunctory manner is precisely because the United States had not yet recognized the resumption of diplomatic relations, fearing international isolation, and therefore did not dare to take a hard line. After the announcement of the resumption of diplomatic relations, the Soviet Union immediately stopped the negotiations on the Chinese Eastern Railway and accelerated military preparations along the Russian border. Its determination is clearly visible. Therefore, it can be asserted that it will not be deceived by Japanese diplomacy. The United States' position in the Pacific is extremely important. Since the naval shipbuilding competition in the Pacific began, the situation has become increasingly serious. On the one hand, it is unwilling to easily abandon its promising market in the Far East. On the other hand, it is unwilling to rashly stake its national strength to protect its far-flung colony - the Philippines. Therefore, despite extreme political contradictions with Japan, it is still seeking a way to coexist and make concessions. However, Japan still does its best to develop its original combative instincts and proclaims itself the leader of the Asian Monroe Doctrine, aiming to block the westward expansion of the United States in the Western Pacific. If Japan's plan to dominate succeeds, those who will bear the brunt are not Soviet Russia, which is striving to close itself off and seek temporary self-preservation, nor Great Britain, which uses Hong Kong as its first line of defense and India as its base, but rather the United States of America, which is eager to develop the Far East, support the Philippines, and preserve its naval base on Guam. At this point, the United States must weigh the pros and cons and abandon its past stubborn prejudices against Russia, and suddenly make peace with it. Therefore, the day it resolves to make peace with Russia is the day it resolves to resist Japan.</p>
<p>In recent days, the pro-American rhetoric advocated by Japan has been ignored by American public opinion. Therefore, the Pacific peace movement advocated by Hirota this time is likely to be like a bubble in the air. As for Great Britain and the United States, although they still have some disagreements on economic issues, they are not insurmountable. From a political perspective, their interests are at stake and are bound to converge. Between Great Britain and Japan, Great Britain is deeply suffering from Japan's economic invasion, and almost the entire country is rising up to resist...</p>
<p>Japan's economic power. In this situation, trying to take advantage of the opposition between Great Britain and the United States and Russia to reap the benefits of the fisherman is no longer...</p>
<p>possible. Therefore, we are deeply regretful for Foreign Minister Hirota's diplomatic policy, for having missed the opportune moment.</p>
<h3 id="e30">Japanese Political Situation Turns From Danger to Safety Hirota Devotes Effort to Diplomatic Work Promotes Peace to Actively Break Through Isolation Opinions of Foreign Ministry and Military Not United <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Foreign Minister Hirota, with the budget issue resolved satisfactorily, will begin the peaceful diplomatic work decided by the previous Five-Minister Conference, starting with frank consultations between Great Britain, the United States, and Japan, as a proposal for the 1935 disarmament conference. The method and timing of the consultations are yet to be determined, but it is hoped that they can be realized within days. (3rd Day Electric Communication)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Foreign Minister Hirota believes that the domestic political situation has stabilized and plans to propose a reorganization plan for the Three-Ministry Liaison Committee to the Army and Navy, making this organ the backing of Foreign Minister Hirota, actively carrying out so-called peaceful diplomacy toward the United States, Russia, and China. It is said that the military's and the Foreign Ministry's diplomatic opinions are still not consistent. The military's diplomatic policy is as follows: (1) A tough policy must be used for diplomacy with Russia, with war as the main and peace as the secondary; (2) Diplomacy with the United States should focus on alienating the United States and Russia and Great Britain and the United States, without actively pursuing peaceful diplomacy and revealing weaknesses; (3) A tough policy must be adopted toward China, with the specific measures as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Assist the National Government, but it is essential to contact local authorities to demand that they recognize Japan's policy toward Manchuria;</p>
<p>(2) The Japanese side agrees to abolish extraterritoriality to contain the China policy of Great Britain and the United States;</p>
<p>(3) Resolve the issues of through traffic and postal service between North China and the puppet state;</p>
<p>(4) Operate aviation businesses between Changchun, Beiping, and Tianjin to obtain aviation rights in North China;</p>
<p>(5) Construct a military railway between Rehe and Beiping;</p>
<p>The Japanese military regards the five items listed on the right as urgent issues to be resolved in its policy toward China, pressing the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to actively negotiate. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs' diplomatic strategy toward the three neighboring countries is as follows: (1) Absolutely no war with Russia. Once war breaks out, Manchuria will be in chaos again, prompting a joint effort by Russia, the United States, and China to deal with Japan. Therefore, it is necessary to do everything possible to prevent the deterioration of Japanese-Russian relations; (2) If the United States cancels its extreme attitude toward the Manchuria policy, it will be of great benefit to Japan. Therefore, it is advisable to encourage the United States to invest in the four northeastern provinces and mainland China. Japanese-American cooperation is the only key to resolving the Far East problem; (3) Continue to maintain cordial friendship with France to contain Great Britain's policy toward Japan; (4) Japan must rectify the above-mentioned diplomatic policies, taking confrontation with Great Britain as the best strategy, because Great Britain is easy to strike, but the United States is not easy to break. (3rd Day Chinese United Press Electric)</p>

At the same time, the authorities concerned also believe that the purpose of establishing the American Bureau and its administrative nature are closely related to the investigation of arms treaties. Therefore, they deeply understand the measures taken by the Ministry of Finance. As a result, the American Bureau is divided into three sections, sharing the investigation of arms treaties, immigration matters, and the systemization of information coordination. Due to budget constraints, the American Bureau will not have a separate director for the time being, and the position will be temporarily held concurrently by Vice Minister Shigemitsu. As for the chief of the Arms Treaty Investigation Section, Mr. Kiyoshi Yamagata, a disarmament treaty expert and currently on leave returning home from his post as First Secretary at the Japanese Embassy in Belgium, has been designated.

<p>According to the Osaka Mainichi Shimbun, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs believes that the independence of Fujian has created a trend for other provinces in China to seek independence. After deliberation by the heads of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, it was unanimously agreed that if Japan's China policy continues to rely on the ambassador to China as the center, as has been the custom, there will be various inconveniences in negotiations when new regimes emerge in various provinces of China in the future. Therefore, it is necessary to take this opportunity to revise and expand the organizational authority of the embassies in China, and to control the diplomatic organs in China in a way that adapts to the new situation, so that when local disputes occur, there is the possibility of rapid negotiation and resolution. The heads of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs have reached a consensus on this view, and Foreign Minister Hirota plans to deploy more capable diplomats to the major cities of Beiping, Shanghai, and Guangzhou, as well as consulates general. At the same time, regarding the anti-Japanese incident in Fuzhou, he is also determined to cooperate with the military to take swift measures to suppress it. (World News Agency)</p>

A concrete plan will be formulated within the year and submitted to the Diet to amend the Public Security Preservation Law, distinguishing between movements that change the national polity and movements that reform the private property system, punishing the former more severely than the latter.

<p>Rome Mussolini and Litvinov held their first political meeting at the Palazzo Venezia today, lasting seventy-two minutes. After leaving, Litvinov spoke passionately in Russian with the Russian ambassador. Litvinov seemed quite pleased with the results of the discussion. Mussolini will pay a return visit to the Russian Embassy this afternoon, and then continue to meet with Litvinov at the welcoming banquet tonight. Both sides remained silent about the issues discussed and did not reveal them to anyone. It is believed that the discussions included commercial relations between Russia and Italy, disarmament issues, and whether the Soviet Union could join the League of Nations or reorganize the organization. The Italians believe that the restoration of relations between the United States and Russia has greatly changed the Soviet Union's position in the world. Mussolini's invitation to Litvinov to come to Italy was for this reason. It is reported that a communique will be issued tonight, describing the issues discussed by the two leaders. Litvinov has recently attracted attention from the world, and many American and European newspapers have recently published his biography. Litvinov is now fifty-seven years old. In his youth, he was exiled to Siberia for opposing Imperial Russia and was one of the veterans of the Bolshevik Party.</p>
<p>Continuing dispatch It is now believed that Litvinov's conversation with Mussolini today had a dual nature: (1) economic and (2) political. On the economic front, Litvinov stated to Mussolini that the treaties he had negotiated in the United States would not harm Italian interests in any way. As for the political aspect, it is believed that the discussions broadly touched on disarmament matters. It is reported that Litvinov made a definite statement that the Soviet Union is willing to rejoin the European group and participate in future disarmament negotiations both inside and outside the disarmament conference. It is also reported that Litvinov stated that the Soviet Union has always spared no effort in seeking the completion of disarmament, and he also mentioned the tense relations between Japan and Russia, saying that Russia is constrained by this issue in Asia, making it difficult to devote its full attention to European affairs. However, Mussolini's attitude toward this issue has not yet been expressed. (3rd Day Reuters Electric)</p>

Only Undersecretary of State Suvic and the Italian representative to the League of Nations, Aloisi, along with the Turkish ambassador, were at the station to welcome him. Litvinov was wearing evening dress. After arriving at the station, he took a car to the Russian Embassy. It is said that he will not make any statement about the purpose of his visit before Tuesday. He later told Reuters reporters that he had long cherished the desire to travel, and this time he was able to fulfill his wish, which made him very happy. Local newspapers mostly stated that the main issues for discussion during Litvinov's visit would be trade relations and disarmament.

<p>Rome From the commentaries published by various newspapers, it can be seen that the central point of the talks between Litvinov and Mussolini is the issue of disarmament. The "Pan-Series Labor Newspaper" is the most interested in commenting, and its discussion seems to imply that Italy can truly understand the value of the Soviet Union and the United States in the issue of disarmament. Italy intends to have the General Committee of the Disarmament Conference recognize the results of the Four-Power negotiations and obtain the prior consent of the Soviet Union, so that it will also agree to these results in the future, to avoid it coming out to obstruct them in the future. Italy also intends to mediate between Germany and Russia to ease their national relations, in order to advocate that partial rearmament of Germany is a necessary condition for the establishment of a disarmament convention.

<p>Rome Newspapers unanimously commented on the amity between Italy and Russia. The "Pan-Series Political Newspaper" especially drew readers' attention to the common interests of the two countries in the Far East. It said, "Japan seems to want to disrupt the interests of the whole world in the Far East. If Italy cooperates with the Soviet Union, it will definitely produce the best results in the Far East. The economic order that has already been formed in the world will not allow one or two ambitious countries to arbitrarily destroy it. The reason why Italy, Russia, and the United States have reached an agreement is precisely to show this intention to Japan." The newspaper also said that Japan was angry at the League of Nations for not directly supporting Japan's actions in China and therefore withdrew from the League of Nations. "However, the League of Nations, in the name of an international organization, entrusted Japan with the rule of various islands in the Pacific, and the conditions of its rule should be reported to the League of Nations on a regular basis. Now that Japan has withdrawn from the League of Nations, why have the various islands in the Pacific not been returned to the League of Nations? What is the reason for this attitude? Its daring to do so is precisely because the Japanese believe that the League of Nations and its member states cannot force Japan to return this mandated territory," it said.

<p>(London) A diplomatic correspondent for the Sunday Observer claimed to have reliable information that British-Russian trade negotiations have now been completed. The agreement is only awaiting the provisional signing by both parties, and the commercial agreement can be concluded. The main obstacle to these negotiations was the Lena Goldfields Company case (the company suffered significant losses in British capital due to the Soviet government's revocation of mining rights and had claimed £13,000,000 in compensation). The Russian representative has now agreed to negotiate directly with the company representative and seems prepared to provide reasonable compensation. Therefore, this obstacle can be said to no longer exist. However, British people who oppose the resumption of commercial relations with the Soviet Union are still very vocal. Therefore, the commercial agreement is unlikely to be ratified before Christmas. (2nd Day Havas Electric)</p>

<p>(Moscow) Communist leaders now claim that Germany is secretly aiding a Ukrainian plot to secede from the Soviet Union. According to a speech delivered today by Central Political Department member Guo Xio at the Ukrainian Communist Party Central Committee meeting, German Chancellor Hitler's diplomatic adviser Rosenberg, in collaboration with Ukrainian exiles, planned to interfere in Ukraine, sending more than a hundred exiles to infiltrate Ukraine, organize military and terrorist groups, prepare for an uprising, and then follow up with German intervention. These leaders had infiltrated the Communist Party and many held high positions in local governments, secretly communicating with exiles and foreign intelligence agencies on weekdays. Guo's announcement of this separatist movement has shocked the entire Soviet Union. However, according to Communist Party leaders, the Ukrainian separatist movement has been completely wiped out, and it is expected that a considerable number of its key figures have been arrested.

<p>(Washington) Today, U.S. Secretary of the Navy Swanson, in his annual report to the President, advocated an orderly and aggressive construction of new ships, so that the U.S. Navy can reach the limits of the treaty and become the most effective fleet in the world, and proposed that the United States, in terms of reducing armaments, should give the world a good example. A weak and old navy is enough to hinder world peace, and the U.S.'s foreign policy must also have a corresponding navy as its backing. Although the U.S. Navy has this program to build warships this time, by December 1936 it will only have 113 warships that have not reached their service limit, totaling 988,520 tons. At that time, Great Britain will have 161 such warships, totaling 999,398 tons, and Japan will have 183 ships, totaling 765,370 tons. At present, the U.S. fleet is still 90 ships short of the strength allowed by the treaty, totaling 157,280 tons, while Great Britain is 64 ships short of the strength allowed by the treaty, totaling 197,607 tons. In addition, Swanson also suggested that new aircraft should be built and replace old aircraft in succession within the existing limit of 1,000 aircraft, restore the original salaries of navy and marine corps generals, soldiers, and cancel the 15 percent deduction of vacation pay. Also, within the total shipbuilding program, new ships should be built and replaced old ships in succession, because the operation and victory or defeat of the navy depends on the fleet it has at the start of the conflict. A country's first line of defense cannot be built overnight. He also said that the United States will have six large cruisers, one aircraft carrier, two submarines, and six destroyers under construction by the end of this year. It is expected that twelve new ships can be completed and formed into a squadron in 1934. At present, the navy has 79,200 soldiers, 5,775 officers, and 48,500 non-military personnel.

<h3 id="e49">British Guarantee of Air Security General Tone of London Newspapers <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>(London) Gavin, the editor of the Observer, summarized the tone of the Sunday newspapers, saying that they unanimously believe that "hereafter, the issue most directly related to national survival is air security." Although this is the actual situation, the conclusions reached by the steady newspapers on this matter clearly divide public opinion into two trends: "One faction focuses on preventing the danger from the air, and the other does not want to hinder the final success of disarmament." Lord Privy Seal Baldwin and the House of Commons originally wanted to link these two things together, but the newspapers divided them into two. Those who support preparing for air defense include the Sunday Times, which advocates immediate preparation for air defense, saying, "It is not effective to set a ratio for the air forces of various countries, because military aviation cannot be equipped hastily. Therefore, in addition to setting a ratio, the air force should be equipped rapidly at the same time." Observer editor Gavin, a Liberal Party polemicist, advocates a more active approach, saying, "If Britain is strong and unites with its neighbors, war will not occur. Conversely, if Britain is weak and separates from Belgium and France, war may break out. For example, in 1914, if Britain had faithfully adhered to a principle, the World War would have been difficult to occur. What is the principle? That is, 'Maintain the strength of the British Navy, making it three times stronger than Germany's'." The Sunday Times refuted the Observer's argument with the reason often advocated by those who oppose the arms race, concluding that organizing an international air force, or at least reaching an agreement on air force between Britain, France, Germany, and Italy, is the only practical solution, because the ideal of general disarmament is certainly very good, but it is inevitable to seek the next best thing.

<p>Honolulu. Mauna Loa peak on the island of Hawaii, which has a crater called Moku'aweoweo, suddenly began erupting at dawn today. Accompanied by earthquakes, residents on the mountainside are scrambling to escape. Currently, lava is erupting from fissures two and a half miles from the crater, like fountains. One jet even reached a height of 500 feet. As the lava flows down, the 1,000-foot cliffs inside the crater wall resemble a giant Niagara Falls. Today, airplanes flew over the crater and reported that it was a rare spectacle. The mountaintop is completely covered with volcanic ash, and fruits and vegetables are scorched. The sound of underground roars and erupting smoke can still be heard several miles away. The snow that had accumulated on the summit of Mauna Loa for several weeks has now melted. However, volcanologists now believe that the lava will not break through the crater walls and flow down to bury the coastal towns, as it did in 1926. (Kuomintang telegram, 2nd)</p>

<p>After the establishment of the so-called People's Government, a Propaganda Committee of the People's Representative Assembly was established. Those in charge are Zhong Xichao, Peng Fangcao, and Hu Qiuyuan of the People's Daily, as well as Chen Weiqi, president of the People's News Agency (formerly the Vanguard News Agency), and Ren Daren, president of the Guoguang Daily. The committee is currently the only propaganda organ of the People's Government. On the evening of the 26th, at 7 p.m., the committee hosted reporters from various newspapers and reporters stationed in Fujian from other provinces in the conference hall (located inside the former Provincial Party Headquarters). Only Cai Xiaogu, a reporter from the Tianjin Ta Kung Pao, and Zhu Jianyu, a reporter from the Hong Kong Huanan News Agency and the Wuzhou Ta Kung Pao, attended from newspapers in other provinces. From the Propaganda Committee, Peng Fangcao, Lin Chongyong, Liu Zhinan, Peng Xinwei, Ren Daren, and Wu Zhixian attended. Peng Fangcao, as chairman, reported on the purpose, roughly saying that there are three points of consideration for today's reception of journalists: (1) From today onwards, this committee will provide news to various newspapers, news agencies, and correspondents stationed in Fujian from other provinces in a systematic manner as much as possible. (2) In the future, the Propaganda Committee is willing to assume the obligation of explaining its attitude towards news. Reporters from various newspapers, news agencies, and correspondents stationed in Fujian from other provinces are welcome to inquire with this committee if they do not understand the news. (3) This committee has recently established a news department to be specifically responsible for liaising with the press. If there are any contacts, you can come at any time. Regarding how the above three points will be implemented in the future, we are extremely eager to know the opinions of the press. Then, Liu Zhinan, the secretary of the Propaganda Committee, spoke, roughly saying that the establishment of the People's Revolutionary Government is by no means the success of the Chinese revolution. It only shoulders the beginning of the crisis of the Chinese nation. Our mission in the future is extremely important, and we must first declare the following matters to you: (1) I hope that reporters from various newspapers and correspondents stationed in Fujian from other provinces will, in the future, stand on the declaration of the rights of the people and the position of saving the country as the basis for compiling reports and issuing manuscripts. If there is any infringement or transgression beyond this basis, this committee will be responsible for correcting and stopping it. (2) In order to facilitate the press and standardize the news, this committee will regularly provide various newspapers and correspondents with news materials as much as possible in the future. (3) In order to establish a close relationship between the Propaganda Committee and the press, the conference has now set up a news department and a news committee, which are headed by Mr. Peng Xinwei. Regardless of day or night, all reporters and correspondents from various newspapers will be given convenience in their contacts. Lin Chongyong then added his opinion, saying that the 19th Route Army accepted the people's request and came to protect the people's rights. I hope that your future remarks will be based on the people's demands. This is not a blockade of speech. The meeting dispersed at 10 o'clock. On the 27th, the news department of the Propaganda Committee also sent a circular to reporters from various newspapers stationed in Fujian, saying: "Dear Sirs, henceforth, for all kinds of news and messages, please send a copy to this department for our reference."

<p>Peiping Dispatch: After the Fujian Incident occurred, the Central Government sent a telegram urging Huang Shao-hong to return to Nanjing immediately to discuss response measures. Huang has recently telegraphed his opinions on Fujian to the Central Government and is scheduled to leave Suiyuan for Datong tomorrow (3rd) to meet with Yan Xishan. Fu Zuoyi will accompany him. The Yunwang (Mongolian Prince) sent four representatives to Nanjing, urging the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region government to be realized as soon as possible. Their representatives have arrived in Suiyuan. It is heard that before leaving Suiyuan, Huang Shao-hong plans to hold a meeting with Fu Zuoyi to discuss the organizational issues of the Inner Mongolia Region government. The governments of the Chahar and Suiyuan provinces completely followed the central government's instructions and unanimously agreed to the organizational principles of the regional government. Li Songfeng previously accompanied Huang Shao-hong to inspect Inner Mongolia. He has now completed his mission, and yesterday morning (1st), he and several members of Huang's staff came to Peiping by special train from Suiyuan. According to Li, "Minister Huang (Shaohong) and Deputy Chairman Zhao (Pilien)'s inspection of Mongolia and repeated meetings with various princes resulted in extremely satisfactory results for the Inner Mongolia autonomy matter. In addition, three results were obtained: (1) The Mongols will never again be seduced by any foreigners in the future. (2) The Mongols' concept of the central government was extremely weak. After the two great officials, Huang and Zhao, went to convey the central government's intentions, not only did the Mongols' feelings towards the central government improve, but the central government also had a very deep impression of Mongolia. (3) Those who accompanied Huang and Zhao this time were various specialized talents, and their investigation of Mongolia's military, political, economic, and nomadic affairs was extremely detailed and will be reported to the central government. The central government can also use this as a standard for reorganizing Mongolian politics in the future. At Bailingmiao, various princes requested that a preparatory committee be established before the local autonomous region government is established. Minister Huang has rejected this and urged them to organize and establish the local autonomous region government as soon as possible, and the princes have also expressed their agreement. Minister Huang is scheduled to leave Suiyuan today or tomorrow and then go to Datong to meet with Mr. Yan. He will travel from Taiyuan to Shijiazhuang in the next few days and then go south to Nanjing via the Pinghan Railway. Because I am responsible for police affairs, I plan to inspect the police affairs in Peiping once and then return to Nanjing by Pingpu train in two or three days." (December 2nd, Jin)</p>
<h3 id="e72">Sichuan Army Launches General Offensive Against Suiding and Xuanhan - Armies Connect and Form Encirclement - Xu Bandits Change Strategy from Attack to Defense - He Bandits Flee Back to the Hubei Border to Join Forces with Xia - <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>Hankou Dispatch: The Sichuan Province bandit suppression military affairs have shown promising progress since Yingshan and Sanhui were successively recovered. According to news gathered over the past few days, the Xu bandits have changed their strategy from fierce attack to firm defense. The eastern route takes Suiding and Xuanhan as its headquarters, concentrating its elite troops there. The mountains of Daxiaopeng and Xiaopeng are also stationed with main forces, with Xindianchang, thirty miles from Yingshan, as the first line and Dachang as the second line. The bandits at Xindianchang are the bandit's puppet fifth army and guerrillas, opposing Yang Sen and Li Qixiang's units. Another major force controls Jiangkou to resist Wang Lingji and Fan Shaozeng's units. The northern route takes Batong as its headquarters, with the Bashan mountain range as its defense line, defending against the Tian and Deng armies. From a global perspective, their momentum seems to have weakened slightly. Currently, Yang Sen's troops have advanced to Xindianchang and are facing off against the bandits. The battles between Longdingguan and Jiulingzi have been fierce for days. Li Qixiang's troops moved forward from Gaofengchang, and Luo Zezhou's troops moved forward from Xujiachang to support Yang's army. Wang and Fan's troops are fiercely attacking Jiangkou, Pujiachang, and other places. At dawn one day, they began a general offensive against Suiding and Xuanhan. A bloody battle is expected to occur in the coming days. After Tian Songyao's troops crossed the Jialing River strongly, they occupied the strategic point of Dadongshan, and Cangxi's defense has become even more consolidated. The line of Zhaohua and Guangyuan is now taken over by Deng Xihou's troops, who need to rest for a few days due to the long journey before launching an attack. From Guangyuan, through Zhaohua, Cangxi, Langzhong, Yingshan, Guang'an, and to Kaijiang, the armies have generally established contact and formed a large encirclement around the bandits. It will be difficult for the bandits to advance in the future. He Long's remnant forces previously fled to eastern Sichuan, while Xia's forces remained entrenched on the border between Hubei, Hunan, and Sichuan. Recently, He Long suffered setbacks in Sichuan and fled back to Hubei, attempting to join forces with Xia, but was unsuccessful. Currently, one force has fled to Dajichang, belonging to Lichuan, and another force has fled to Xiaoguan, belonging to Hefeng. The basic bandits number only 2,000, and the newly formed guerrillas number no more than 1,000. They are being suppressed by Xu Yuanquan's troops. (December 2nd)</p>

<p>Jinan Dispatch: Since Feng Yuxiang moved to Tai'an from Chahar, he has not been involved in current affairs. Recently, due to the Fujian situation, rumors spread that he had secretly gone to Fujian, while the Japanese claimed that he had gone to Shanxi in disguise. The reality is that Feng has not left Mount Tai. In order to commemorate Guo Songling, Wang Jinyu, Zheng Jinsheng, Zhang Shaozeng, and others, he purchased one mu of land about half a mile northeast of the Puzhao Temple, where he resides, for 300 yuan to build a shrine for worship. The construction has now been completed, and today (1st) the unveiling ceremony was held. The descendants of Guo and others were invited in advance to participate in the ancestral rites personally presided over by Feng. The shrine gate faces south, and the three houses are of old-style architecture with tiled roofs and stone walls and are not very grand but extremely sturdy. All the arrangements were made according to Feng's intentions. The north house is for Guo Songling, Wang Jinyu, and others, the east house is for Zhang Shaozeng and Guo Songling's wife, and the west house is for Zheng Jinsheng. All use stone tablets, engraved with words and painted vermilion, calling them "Spiritual Tablet of a Certain Martyr." At 9:30 this morning, Feng and more than 200 descendants of Guo and other guests came to the shrine to perform the unveiling ceremony followed by the public sacrifice. They performed the rituals of presenting wreaths as usual. Feng then gave a simple speech, roughly saying that martyrs' shrines are built to commemorate the revolutionary martyrs who died in bloodshed. There are many in various places, but they are still lacking in the north. He built this martyrs' shrine in Tai'an, a scenic area of Mount Tai. The martyrs enshrined in this shrine were loyal and great, rarely seen before. Everyone had a spirit of sacrifice. He personally witnessed them many times in the Luanzhou battle and the Northern Expedition battles. The martyrs died for their country for many years. The purpose of building this shrine today is to mark their memory, comfort the dead underground, and inspire future generations. After Feng's speech, Zheng Jicheng delivered a thank-you speech, and Zhou Baihuang, the magistrate of Taishan County, also gave a speech, expounding the meaning of commemorating the martyrs and praising Feng's thrift in clothing and food to build the shrine to commemorate the martyrs. Then the ceremony ended and the meeting adjourned. (1st)</p>

<p>Anqing Dispatch: The unfinished project of the Anhui Province Jianghuai Main Embankment previously received a reply from the National Economic Council stating that the council had no funds to appropriate and requesting that Anhui Province raise its own funds. The council immediately replied and instructed the counties along the Yangtze River and Huai River to be responsible for requisitioning labor. The "Supervision and Construction Measures for Continuing to Repair the Jianghuai Main Embankment" were drafted and submitted to the Provincial Government Standing Committee for approval and promulgation. Now, the Anhui Province Disaster Area Relief Fundraising Committee has formulated measures for borrowing funds to repair the inland embankments and submitted them to the Provincial Government for review by the Civil Affairs and Construction Departments. The measures are as follows: (1) These measures are limited to the repair of dikes adjacent to the dikes along the Yangtze River and Huai River repaired by the National Government Water Disaster Relief Committee last year, and to the parts of the inland lakes and dikes subsidized by the Anhui Central and Southern Emergency Work Relief Joint Office organized by the committee that have collapsed and are in dangerous locations. (2) If the collapsed dikes in this province meet the provisions of the preceding article, and the arable land within the dikes is more than 5,000 mu, and it can be completed with the amount of the loan to be determined later, the county government may, at the request of the dike residents' representatives or the dike construction committee, formulate a plan and the amount of the loan, submit it to the Construction Department for verification, and forward it to the Provincial Government to apply to the Four Provinces Farmers Bank, the National Economic Council, other banks and silver firms, or other relief agencies. They will be guaranteed by the recovery funds of agricultural relief handled by the China Foreign Relief Committee on behalf of the National Government Water Disaster Relief Committee last year. The county government will repay the loan from the proceeds of the restored dikes in installments based on the benefiting arable land. The repayment period shall not exceed five years. (3) The loan shall be secured by the entire area of benefiting arable land within the dike and guaranteed by the county government, without additional contracts. The amount of the loan shall not exceed 1.5 yuan per mu. The loan certificate shall be signed and sealed by the county magistrate and the dike construction committee, and submitted to the Construction Department for transfer to the Provincial Government, which shall add its seal of guarantee for repayment of principal and interest. (4) If the amount to be paid by the benefited arable land is not paid when due, the arable land will be auctioned by the county government to repay the debt, or if the original owner needs to sell the arable land before the loan is repaid, the debt will be transferred with the arable land and shall be borne by the transferee. (5) Interest rates, repayment periods, and all procedures shall be determined by the Construction Department's order to the county government and the creditor agency through consultation. (6) The repair project shall be supervised by a commissioner appointed by the Construction Department, together with the county magistrate and the dike construction committee, and shall be completed within a time limit. (7) The creditor agency may send personnel to supervise the project and audit the arable land at any time. (8) Detailed measures shall be determined separately by the Construction Department. (9) These measures shall be promulgated and implemented upon the decision of the Provincial Government Committee. (November 1st)</p>

<p>Zhang A Xiao (also known as Shi Tang Xiao Di), a notorious bandit from Qingpu Shi Tang who was formerly associated with the gangster Tai Bao A Shu's gang in Pudong, escaped justice after Tai Bao A Shu and others were successively arrested and executed. He repeatedly colluded with Jiangbei gang leader Gao Guiyou (who has been executed) to commit numerous robberies and kidnappings in various towns and villages in Jiangsu and Zhejiang. Recently, on August 27th of this year, he again gathered a group to rob the China Merchants Bureau's Hengji steamer at Yu Hui Tang in Zhejiang. On October 12th, he resisted arrest and opened fire on the Ding Zha Changbei team in Dingjia Zha, Zhejiang, killing several team members. Xu Pucheng, the head of the First District of the Jiangsu Provincial Maritime Public Security Bureau, dispatched detectives and ordered a wanted notice to be issued, but the bandit had not been captured for a long time. According to recent reports, the bandit Zhang A Xiao and others had secretly come to Shanghai, planning to collude with accomplices and start a gang in the Dianshan Lake area. However, their whereabouts were uncertain. After Xu, the head of the district, ordered detectives to investigate and determine their address, he secretly ordered team leader Luo Daokun to lead detectives in disguise to keep watch at the address. As expected, they captured the bandit Zhang A Xiao and his wife, Yang Xiubao. They were immediately escorted to the Minhang District Department, where Xu, the head of the district, personally interrogated them. The bandit Zhang A Xiao confessed that in the nineteenth year, he was in the Tai Bao A Shu gang and gathered a group to rob Jinjia Zhuang in Zhejiang. In the Gao Xu battle, he opened fire and resisted arrest with Xu, the head of the district. After being scattered, he repeatedly committed robberies and kidnappings for ransom. The robbery of the China Merchants Bureau's Hengji steamer at Yu Hui Tang was also their doing. Regarding the circumstances of opening fire and resisting arrest with the Changbei team in Dingjia Zha, Zhejiang, he confessed that there were still firearms and ammunition hidden in the straw pile at his home in Shi Tang. Xu, the head of the district, then sent special task force leader Li Quanwu, along with the criminal, aboard the Hongping patrol ship to Zhang Liantang to join the resident detachment and search the premises, seizing eleven various types of rifles and hundreds of rounds of ammunition. His mother, Zhang Qian, was also taken to the district for questioning.</p>

<p>The widening of San Xia Tang Street has progressed from mere talk to a reality. With a designated budget of 18,000 yuan, County Magistrate Yan Shenyu, in order to actively carry out the project, dispatched Qin Xiangtao and Wang Xingzhi, engineers from the Municipal Engineering Department, on the 29th of last month to survey and mark the gray lines and set up central wooden stakes as standards for demolishing and relinquishing the houses on both sides. All procedures are now in place, and it is scheduled to begin automatically demolishing and relinquishing the properties on New Year's Day next year. Those who do not comply will have their properties forcibly demolished by workers hired by the Engineering Department. The residents within the street district do not object, as they believe that the widening will revitalize the market and greatly facilitate transportation. In the past two days, the Qin family's house next to the Xiaolou Lane Embroidery Workshop on the south side, and the Western-style house of Ran Congqiao Gu Zijingxian, have both hired masonry and carpentry workers to demolish and relinquish their properties voluntarily. To avoid disputes, residents Qian Jiqing, Li Shian, Qian Baohua, and others specially convened a meeting of citizens of the street at the Qin Yizhuang on the Dahe River yesterday to discuss and exchange views, expressing unanimous support. In addition to issuing public notices, the county government has also sent letters to each resident, urging them to demolish and relinquish their properties as soon as possible in order to facilitate construction and benefit transportation.</p>

<p>More than ten households, mostly farmers, reside in Dai Lane, near Dongting Town in the tenth district of the county. At around eight o'clock in the morning, a fire suddenly broke out at Dai Afa's house, spreading to neighboring houses on the left and right. The fire was fierce and difficult to extinguish. Residents of the village immediately sounded the gong. Upon hearing the alarm, fire brigades from Dongting, Tingzhuang, Xintang Bridge, Houyang, Jiangxi Bridge, and other places rushed to the scene with water pumps to fight the fire. However, because the flames spread widely, their efforts were futile. The villagers were in great disorder. Fortunately, Chen Yi, the instructor of the Tengchang Township Winter Defense Fitness Exercise Team, led more than ten team members, including Hu Chunyu, to the scene to maintain order. A firefighter, in his bravery to extinguish the fire, knocked down a wall, but the wall collapsed, and he was unable to escape, being buried in the house. Although he was rescued by other firefighters, he was seriously injured. The fire was extinguished after burning for about four hours. Dozens of houses in the village were completely destroyed by the fire, with a total loss of about 15,000 yuan, the heaviest loss being borne by the Dai Sanbao family. The injured firefighter has been sent to the hospital for treatment.</p>

<p>Jiashan County is organizing the Home Guard, but due to a lack of funds, it was unanimously decided last winter to levy a mou tax of one jiao per mou to fund the Home Guard's core team. This year, with the addition of the standing team, the funding is even more strained. Unexpectedly, when the mou tax began to be collected, the county government suddenly proposed to appropriate 60% for the county. As a result, the town heads protested one after another. Subsequently, the county party department proposed at the county representative assembly that 70% should go to the towns and 30% to the county, but the county government has not yet agreed. When Civil Affairs Commissioner Lü Michou inspected Xitang, he summoned the town heads for talks and learned that the town heads had asked Lü to resolve this issue.</p>

Afterwards, Bao filed a complaint with the Jiaxing Branch Court, which sentenced Wang Yuzuo to a fine of 300 yuan, Peng Yuquan to 200 yuan, and Jiang Xianfa to two years in prison. Wang and others were dissatisfied and appealed to the High Court. Yesterday, the High Court ruled that Wang Yuzuo would still be fined 300 yuan, Peng Yuquan would be sentenced to six months in prison, Jiang Xianfa's appeal was rejected, and Wang Yuzuo, Peng Yuquan, and Jiang Xianfa should be jointly and severally liable for repaying Bao Guifu 500 yuan.</p>

<p>The Jiangsu Department of Finance recently examined and selected more than 30 county accounting directors. Later, the central government assigned more than 20 graduates from the first class of the Finance Department of the Political School, ordering the Department of Finance to employ them, resulting in most of the selected personnel being disappointed.

<p>Regarding the Southeast Township School being ordered to be taken over by the province, a meeting of representatives from 26 townships was convened on the first day to discuss and unanimously resist according to law. The attending representatives and executive committee members petitioned the county government education bureau, vowing to fight to the death and refusing to hand over the property of the school, which is jointly owned by the people of the 26 townships in the southeast. They requested the province to withdraw the order and submit it to the provincial government for reconsideration. The county bureau and the provincial government agreed to submit it to the province for instructions. After the representatives withdrew, Mao Youru, a standing committee member of the West Township Office, allegedly claimed to be going to the province to avoid meeting County Magistrate Ruan when he went to take over the school, using this as an excuse to defy the provincial order and refuse to hand it over (yesterday, the first day). County Magistrate Ruan ordered the police to take Mao into custody. The West Township Office telegraphed the province, requesting assistance.</p>

<p>Du Ruiliang, a partner in the Han Xie Mao flower firm in Shazhou Shanzheng Bridge, went to the Houcheng Qingxin yarn shop at 5:00 PM on October 11 to withdraw 250 yuan for flowers. He was robbed on the highway near Chuanxin Port. After the victim reported the crime to the county, Zhao Wang and Wu Yueqing were detained. They confessed that the robbery was committed by fugitives Jiang Defu and Yang Dejin, who were formerly members of the Home Guard. The detective team recently arrested Yang Dejin at the Yong'an Inn on Sima Road in Shanghai and sent him to the Jinghu Railway Police Department for detention. The Public Security Bureau has dispatched Yang Yicheng to Shanghai to escort him back.</p>

<p>Zhang Xiaomao, from the Xiangyi Fang in the western countryside of Xiaoshan, was originally a farmer, but he was addicted to gambling. After his father passed away in the spring, Zhang became even more reckless, selling off the family's fields and squandering the proceeds. He often clashed with his mother, demanding money. On the 30th of last month, he demanded money from his mother again, and when she refused, he severely beat his elderly mother, who was over seventy years old. His mother, in despair, attempted suicide by drowning herself in the river. Fortunately, a fishing boat spotted her and managed to rescue her, but she was barely breathing. The villagers are indignant and have filed a lawsuit with the county, requesting that he be severely punished.</p>

<p>On the afternoon of the 30th, more than a hundred refugees from Jiangxi arrived in Xinfawang, in the eastern countryside of Xiaoshan. They were supporting the old and carrying the young, looking very miserable. They first went to each household, forcibly demanding money and rice. If their demands were not met, they would smash things indiscriminately, terrifying the people. Fortunately, the township police gathered some money and rice, and they dispersed. Unexpectedly, dozens more refugees arrived the next day, engaging in robbery. Fortunately, the water police suppressed them and expelled them from the area, and nothing further happened.</p>

After discussion, it was proposed to temporarily issue 50,000 qián of circulation coupons, which were not used in the relief of the money shortage in December of the 19th year of the Republic, to facilitate turnover. Each industry would raise 17,000 yuan in cash as a reserve fund. A management and guarantee committee would be organized, with managers of reputable stores in each industry serving as committee members. A preparatory meeting will be held again today (the 30th) at 2:00 PM to submit the plan to the party and government agencies for filing.</p>

<p>According to the Xinxin News Agency, the sudden interruption of the Shanghai-Fujian telegraph line the night before last led to rumors of contact between Liu Heding's troops and the 19th Route Army in northern Fujian, causing alarm and tension. A reporter from the Xinxin News Agency inquired at the Telegraph Bureau of the Ministry of Communications yesterday morning and learned that the Shanghai-Fujian telegraph line had been interrupted briefly due to the telegraph line touching the telephone line around 8:00 PM last night (the night before last). It has now been repaired and is functioning as usual. Therefore, the rumor of contact in northern Fujian was a misunderstanding.</p>
<h3 id="e90">Tang Youren Discusses Central Government's Use of Force Against Fujian; Sealing Fujian Ports Met with Protests from Various Countries; We Have Requested All Japanese Residents to Evacuate <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>It is rumored that Tang Youren, the Secretary-General of the Central Political Committee, came to Shanghai to discuss methods for handling the Fujian situation with central committee members in Shanghai. A reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency visited Tang at his residence yesterday morning. According to Tang, he came entirely for personal matters. The central government has no other suitable method other than using force against Fujian. Sealing the ports has not been effectively implemented, and various countries have opposed it. The following is a record of Tang's remarks:</p>
<h3 id="e91">Purely Personal Matters <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>Tang stated that his visit was purely for personal matters and that he did not have the task of discussing solutions to the Fujian situation with central committee members in Shanghai. He had family matters that urgently needed to be addressed, so he took a flight to Shanghai yesterday, causing special attention from the outside world. On the central government's side, it is believed that the Fujian issue cannot be resolved politically. Chen and others have betrayed the country and overthrown the party's rule. The central government can only adopt military methods to quickly quell the rebellion and prevent the spread of red terror. It is now reported that there is severe internal strife and division within the Fujian faction, which may avoid the outbreak of war.</p>

<p>It is untrue that clashes have already occurred in northern Fujian. It is difficult for the Fujian army to transport troops because the mountain roads in northern Fujian are rugged, the water flow is rapid, and transportation is inconvenient. Reports that the Fujian faction will still follow Sun Chuanfang's old route into Zhejiang are also not easy. Previously, when Sun advanced from Fuzhou, it took six days of walking to reach the border of Zhejiang. It is too early to say that clashes have occurred in northern Fujian. There is no such speed. As for the central army advancing towards Fujian, it will be easy to march because they are in a commanding position.</p>

<p>The maritime blockade of Fujian has been in effect for a few days, with inspections of incoming and outgoing ships. Various countries are currently engaging in negotiations with us on this matter. Japan is using the pretext of protecting Japanese residents. We have requested all Japanese residents to evacuate. However, Japan believes that the losses from evacuating so many people would be too great and has not been able to implement it. Currently, there are 20,000 Taiwanese and over a thousand Japanese in Fujian. As for foreigners, there are four French citizens who are working as professors and are quite safe, which is not a problem.</p>
<h3 id="e94">Yang Dezao Discusses Visit to Jiangxi to Meet Chiang; Reports on Situation in the South Without Negotiations; Fujian Uprising Affects Communist Suppression in Jiangxi <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>According to the Far East News Agency, Yang Dezao, the representative of Chen Jitang, the Commander-in-Chief of the Communist Suppression in the South, returned from northern Guangdong a month ago and, under Chen's orders, passed through Nanjing to visit Chiang in Jiangxi. He took a China National Aviation Corporation plane back to Nanjing the day before yesterday and then took the 5:25 PM express train to Shanghai that afternoon. A reporter from the Far East News Agency interviewed him at his residence on Avenue Amre yesterday and recorded the following:</p>
<h3 id="e95">Chiang-Chen Meeting Completely Untrue <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>Yang, in response to the reporter's question, first stated that his visit to Jiangxi to meet Chairman Chiang was to report on the military situation of the Communist Suppression in the South and that there was no so-called negotiation. Reports that Chairman Chiang and Chen Bonan (Jitang) met in Nanfeng previously are completely untrue. However, it is true that Chen and He Jian, the Chairman of Hunan, met in Lechang, but it was only to discuss military strategies for suppressing the communists.</p>
<h3 id="e96">No News of Hu Forming a Government <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>He continued to say that he had only seen reports about Hu Hanmin forming another government in the southwest and had not heard anything about it. He had not heard any such rumors when he passed through Hong Kong from Guangdong last time. As for the joint telegram sent by the Southwest Executive Department and the Southwest Political Committee to the central government with some kind of expression, he had not seen the telegram and did not know its implications. However, based on what he knew in the past, Chen Bonan and others have always sympathized with the central government. Their response to the Fujian uprising should be in line with the central government's actions.</p>
<h3 id="e97">Communist Suppression Affected by Fujian <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>He also stated that eight months ago, when he was in Nanchang, he still had some doubts about the central government's plan for suppressing the communists. After staying in Nanchang for a week and talking to officers of all levels, he deeply understood that the military operation to suppress the communists was very promising. Although it was not possible to completely wipe them out within two months as Chairman Chiang had said, it was certainly not difficult to completely wipe them out within at least four to six months. The communist forces have two major shortcomings: a lack of supplies and difficulty in replenishment. Especially since the implementation of the blockade policy, the communist areas have felt an increasing panic about supplies. In addition, the communist suppression forces have won successive victories in recent months, and the communist forces have been unable to replenish their ranks due to heavy casualties. If the communist suppression forces are not restrained, their eradication can be expected soon. However, the uprising in Fujian has opened a door for the communists, providing them with supplies and resources. As a result, the military operation to suppress the communists has been greatly affected, which is truly heartbreaking. Yang finally stated that he had no mission on this visit to Shanghai, would stay for a day or two, and then return to Nanjing.</p>
<h3 id="e98">Former Chief of Staff of the Garrison Headquarters Zhang Xiang Returns to Shanghai for Discussions; Visit to Chen and Chiang Unsuccessful, Advice Ignored; Two Meetings with Dai Ji Held at Banquets; Commercial Market in Fuzhou Further Depressed by the Uprising <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>According to the Guowen News Agency, Zhang Xiang, the former Chief of Staff of the Songhu Garrison Headquarters, followed Dai Ji for many years. After Dai resigned as commander and traveled to North China, he went to Fujian. Shortly after, Zhang also resigned from his position in Shanghai and went to Fujian to sweep the tombs. Zhang suddenly returned the other day, leading to rumors that Dai and Zhang disagreed with the policies of the Fujian province, and that Dai had been detained by Fujian. Yesterday, a reporter visited Zhang's residence on Jin Shenfu Road, where Zhang granted an interview. The following is a record of the conversation:</p>
<h3 id="e99">Visiting Tombs in Fujian <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>When Zhang met the reporter, he first stated that after resigning from his position at the Garrison Headquarters, he was invited by friends from other places. However, he had not returned to Minhou, his hometown, since leaving in 1927. So, he decided to take advantage of the tomb-sweeping opportunity and return to Fujian. He departed from Shanghai on the 15th of last month and arrived in Fuzhou on the 17th. At that time, he had only heard rumors of the Fujian uprising, not seen any actual events. He originally planned to return to Shanghai after finishing the tomb-sweeping and taking care of family matters, and then respond to the invitation of a friend. However, after completing the tomb-sweeping, Fujian actually declared independence. Seeing this situation, he knew it would be difficult to stay any longer and took the Jisheng ship, which departed from Fuzhou directly, in the late last month and came directly to Shanghai. Chen Tianjing, the commander of the naval training camp who escaped, also came to Shanghai on the same ship. Therefore, Zhang had already been in Shanghai for several days.</p>
<h3 id="e100">Meeting Chen and Chiang <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>Zhang also said that when he arrived in Fuzhou on the 17th, he heard that there would be changes in Fujian Province. Chen Mingshu and Jiang Guangnai were his former superiors, so he went to visit Chen and Chiang. At that time, he immediately saw that internal and external troubles were coming one after another. If the domestic political situation changed again, the country would be torn apart. He presented his opinions to Chen and Chiang. However, at that time, the Fujian faction had already made up its mind, and he was a person of little importance. How could he make anyone change their mind? Seeing that the matter was difficult to reverse, he went to the countryside the next day to sweep the tombs and take care of personal matters. After the matter was completed, he saw that the situation had changed greatly and returned quickly. He did not stay in Fujian for a long time.</p>
<h3 id="e101">Recent Situation in Fuzhou <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>The situation in Fuzhou, such as commerce, has been deteriorating in recent years. Minhou is the location of the provincial capital, and public security is still considered peaceful. However, under the conditions of rural bankruptcy and economic depression in China, the market was already depressed. Now, after this change, the economy has become even more depressed. A sense of terror has not yet appeared.</p>
<h3 id="e102">Two Meetings with Dai <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>Finally, the reporter asked about the rumors that Dai had been detained by the Fujian faction. According to Zhang, he met Commander Dai twice in Fujian, but the meetings were all at private banquets. Every time he wanted to ask Dai something, Dai would raise his glass and say, "Please, please." So he did not ask. After the banquet, Dai stayed at Chairman Jiang's (Guangnai) residence, and the gate of Jiang's residence was heavily guarded, so it was inconvenient to disturb him. Now he has returned to Shanghai for several days, so he does not dare to speculate on the details. When asked if he would soon leave Shanghai to go to Nanjing or to answer the call of a friend, he replied that he was temporarily taking care of family affairs in Shanghai and would not leave Shanghai or go to Nanjing. After the conversation, they parted ways.</p>

<p>Japanese Ambassador Ariyoshi Akira, accompanied by Counselor Ariye and Secretary Yokokawa, went to Nanjing on the evening of the 30th of last month to meet with Wang Jingwei, who also served as the Minister of Foreign Affairs, to discuss matters. They have now completed their public duties. Yesterday morning at 7:30, they took the overnight express train from Nanjing back to Shanghai and went directly to his private residence on Bi Xun Road to rest. It is heard that the Japanese ambassador went to Nanjing to clarify to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that Japan has no contact with the Fujian faction and that the Fujian faction's request for a loan from Japan is absolutely untrue. They also discussed diplomatic issues in North China. The Japanese ambassador plans to return to Japan in early January to report to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and request instructions.</p>

<p>According to Gu Xinyi, the chairman of the Shanghai Rice Merchants Association, the chairman of the preparatory committee, the date of the preparatory meeting for the grain production and sales cooperation of eight provinces was determined by the Shanghai representatives. Two letters were sent to the provincial governments and rice merchants, and Chiang Kai-shek's headquarters in Nanchang was also notified separately. Therefore, the representatives from various provinces will be able to arrive on time. It has now been received that Zhang Kailian and Tan Changkai from Hunan, Wang Chengying from Zhejiang, Xu Daochun from Henan, Jia Shiyi from Hubei, Zhu Huaibing and Gong Wensui from Jiangxi, Dong Guangfu and Tong Sanmin from Jiangsu, and Yuan Fen from Anhui, are all traveling to Shanghai with rice merchants from various provinces. They should be able to arrive in port today and tomorrow (that is, yesterday and today). The Shanghai representatives have prepared to entertain them. However, no reply has been received from the representatives of Guangdong and Hebei provinces. It is feared that the representatives from Fujian may not be able to attend due to the current situation. Yesterday, the Jiangsu Provincial General Chamber of Commerce also sent a letter requesting permission to send personnel to participate.</p>

<p>According to the Xinxin News Agency, the Ministry of Finance, based on the request of the Jiangsu Provincial General Chamber of Commerce, has ordered banks and money shops to increase grain mortgage loans to save the rural areas and promote industry and commerce. After learning the situation, the ministry has specially informed the municipal government and notified the Shanghai Bankers Association, hoping to earnestly encourage all banks and businesses to make as many loans as possible to facilitate turnover and provide relief.</p>

<p>Since the January 28th Incident, the city's income has not met its expenses, and the finances are quite difficult.

<p>After Kim Seok, a Korean who had naturalized as a Chinese citizen, was arrested in the French Concession on November 22, more than 360 citizens, including Zhang Yiqing and Li Yannian, sent letters to various organizations requesting assistance. The public has paid close attention to this issue. The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce immediately submitted a request to the municipal government for serious intervention to protect him. At the same time, Kim Seok's father, Kim Young-dak (name: Cheol), issued an emergency statement to the Xinsheng News Agency, stating the process of naturalization with the permission of the Chinese government. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e110">Petition from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>This petition concerns a request. It has been observed that the Japanese have been enticing and arresting Korean nationals who have naturalized as Chinese citizens almost constantly over the past year. However, there has been no satisfactory resolution or strict negotiation. Which Korean national would be willing to naturalize as Chinese again, only to court uncertainty? When Japanese consuls arrest people in Chinese territory, they should request our officials to transfer the arrested according to treaty extradition measures. If arrests occur in the concession, considering that the Korean national has already naturalized as Chinese, the case should be handled by the Second Special District Court according to the court agreement method, not unilaterally by the Japanese consulate. Furthermore, if they proceed with enticement and arrest without first consulting the French Concession, it constitutes an infringement of the French Concession's police authority, and the French consul should not condone it. The case of Jin Yongduo last year serves as a precedent. It is appropriate to prepare a document and submit it to your esteemed government for review, and to request a thorough investigation and strict negotiation. This would be a matter of public benefit.</p>
<h3 id="e111">Jin Yongduo's Statement <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>Jin Yongduo (Che) makes an urgent statement to the reporter of the News Society regarding the illegal arrest of his eldest son, Xi. The statement begins: Although Che was born in Korea, he was permitted to naturalize by the Chinese government on October 5th of the 18th year of the Republic of China, holding Permit No. 67, which serves as proof. Therefore, since October of the 18th year of the Republic of China, the entire Che family has obtained Chinese nationality. In other words, they are purely Chinese citizens. As Chinese citizens, they should be protected by Chinese law. There is no doubt that, according to international norms and other legal principles, the legal rights and interests of the entire Che family should not be interfered with by any country. However, Che's eldest son, Xi, was suddenly arrested in the French Concession on November 22nd of this year. It is reported that he has been taken to the Japanese consulate and illegally detained. Xi is a member of the Chinese Nationalist Party (Kuomintang), and he is usually law-abiding and is currently studying. He has not participated in any illegal activities. Factually, he is innocent of any arrest. Legally, the French Concession is Chinese territory, and even if there is a place where he should be restrained, it is not the Japanese consulate that can make excuses to arrest him. The Che family has repeatedly presented the permit and politely requested his release, but all have been rejected. This matter concerns Che's individual legal rights. The law firm of Yunmei, Xu Jie, and Luo Zhaoxin is legally negotiating, and Mr. Chen Yang and Mr. Li Shichang have been asked to represent and petition the authorities. In addition, I hope that all national legal organizations and wise people at home and abroad will provide support so that Che's son can regain his freedom. I offer my sincere prayers. Respectfully, Jin Che, December 1st.</p>
<h3 id="e112">Zheng Chengqing's Remarks <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, a reporter from the News Society specially visited Mr. Zheng Chengqing of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to inquire about the details of the Jin case. According to Mr. Zheng, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce received a letter a few days ago requesting the rescue of Jin Xi, along with a photograph of Jin Xi's nationality certificate. There is no doubt that Jin Xi is a citizen of the Republic of China. The French Concession authorities, in violation of the agreement of the French Concession Court, allowed the Japanese to arrest our citizens within the concession, which is truly inappropriate. Therefore, for the sake of national sovereignty, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce has petitioned the municipal government to negotiate seriously. Mr. Zheng also showed the photograph of the nationality certificate. The original text of the certificate is recorded below: (Ministry of Interior Nationality Permit No. 67, stating the permitted naturalized person Jin Yongduo, male, age 39, native place Joseon, Jin Nan Hampyeong County, Xinguang Nanham Seungri, residence, Shanghai French Concession, Blanc Niermont Malang Road, 446, those who obtain nationality along with the naturalized person, wife Cui Huichun, age 30, eldest son Jin Xi, age 18, second son Jin Degen, age 16, daughter Jin Meiqing, age 1, the aforementioned Jin Yongduo, applying for permission to naturalize in the Republic of China in accordance with the Nationality Law of the Republic of China, meets the statutory conditions and should be permitted. In addition to registration by the Ministry, a permit is issued. This certificate, October 15th, 18th year of the Republic of China.</p>
<h3 id="e113">Jin Xi is Not the Principal Offender <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>According to Japanese newspapers in Tokyo, Jin Xi, who was captured in Shanghai, is the main culprit in the Hongkou Baichuan case from the previous year. Upon investigation, Jin and his father, Jin Che, were captured by the Japanese the previous winter. Afterwards, Wu Kaisheng and Cai Xiaobai negotiated with the French Consul and finally secured their release. Due to the issue of Chinese traitors, various interactions between Ji Zhuqing and Wu Chengyu, and Jin Xi and Huang Zhanying, have been reported in Shanghai newspapers. This time, he was captured by the Japanese again. The reporter from the News Society specially interviewed Mr. Ji Zhuqing, asking if Jin was as reported in the Tokyo newspapers. Ji said that although they had organized a Sino-Korean anti-Japanese group with Jin, the purpose was to advance and retreat in accordance with the Chinese government's policy towards Japan, and not to carry out any conspiracy in the hope of luck. Unexpectedly, many rumors were fabricated by Chinese traitors and secretly reported to the other side, claiming that the Hongkou case was masterminded by Jin. However, Jin was only 20 years old at the time and could only do propaganda work. Moreover, Jin Jiu had already stepped forward to admit responsibility for the Hongkou case. Even if it was not Jin Jiu, it must have been an important figure in Korea, and Jin Xi could not have participated in it. Last year, because their group was betrayed by unscrupulous elements, the undersigned and Jin Xi and others published announcements withdrawing from the group. Since then, Jin has stopped propaganda work as well. At the beginning of this month, Jin sent a letter asking me to help him find a job. Because I was unable to help, I did not proceed. This letter is still with me, which further proves that Jin's crime is related to the Hongkou case. The Japanese are exaggerating their claims only to expose that they were sold out by Chinese traitors.</p>
<h3 id="e114">No Previous Deficits <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>The city's finances have always been quite ample. Although there has been no surplus each year, there have also been no deficits. Over the years, efforts have been made to rectify various tax revenues. For example, the income in the 16th year of the Republic was only over 3 million, but it increased to over 5 million in the 18th year and over 8 million in the 20th year. Although the income in the 21st year was affected by the January 28th Incident, it was still higher than in previous years. However, after the January 28th Incident, the city's expenditures increased sharply, making it difficult to balance revenue and expenditure. Therefore, increasing revenue and reducing expenditure are currently necessary.</p>
<h3 id="e115">Periodic Land Tax Collection <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>The city's financial situation has indeed felt extremely strained recently. The municipal government has ordered the bureau to quickly seek ways to increase revenue and reduce expenditure. The undersigned (蔡氏自稱, Cai, referring to himself) believes that the land value tax is the proper way to increase revenue, and the concession authorities have already started collecting it. The central government also has regulations on collection. Given the high land prices in the city and the city's financial difficulties, collection is indeed necessary. Therefore, the city has already notified landlords in the urban area to start collecting the second installment of the land value tax for this year from the 21st of this month, and to pay it at designated locations within two months of the start of collection.</p>
<h3 id="e116">Sharp Increase in Security Expenses <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>The reason why the city's finances feel strained is that security expenses after the January 28th Incident increased from 2 million to 3.5 million. Before the January 28th Incident, the city's security expenses, excluding public security fees, were all borne by the central government. However, since the January 28th Incident, the city established a security office. Given the vast area of the city and the mix of people from all over, a stronger security force is needed to maintain order. Therefore, the establishment of the security office was indeed necessary. However, after the establishment of the security office, the city's security expenses increased by more than 1 million. Security expenses have always been offset by income from house rentals. The house rental collected in the city is only about 2.3 million. Now that security expenses have increased to about 3.5 million, the difference is a shortfall of about 1.2 million. This cannot be offset by rectifying the old taxes. Now that the central government has approved the collection of land value tax, which can generate more than 1 million yuan per year, the city's finances may be balanced.</p>
<h3 id="e117">Ministry of Finance Instructs Guohua Bank to Operate With Confidence, Finding that the Bank is Not Related to the Fujian Incident <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>According to the New Voice News, during the January 28th Incident, Shanghai Guohua Bank, along with the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Shanghai Bankers' Association, and the Shanghai Local Coordination Association, were moved by righteous indignation and collected patriotic donations for the 19th Route Army. Therefore, they were feared by the Japanese. After the 19th Route Army's rebellion in Fujian, rumors were spread to undermine the bank. Fearing that the public would misunderstand and affect finance, the bank formally requested the Ministry of Finance for protection. The Ministry of Finance sent officials to investigate in detail. It was found that Deng Ruiren and others had used a business name to deposit more than 50,000 yuan in shares. The 19th Route Army's deposits were withdrawn on November 3rd, leaving no balance. The remittance exchanges of the Xiamen branch were also investigated one by one, and all were purely commercial transactions with no affiliation or aid to the rebellious party. The Ministry of Finance instructed the bank to operate with confidence. The bank's business is as usual. Yesterday, which was Sunday, the bank's four branches in Baxianqiao, Hongkou, Xinzha, and Nanshi were all open at 10 am as usual, with no unusual circumstances.</p>

<p>Today is the fortieth birthday of the former Minister of Finance, Soong Tzu-wen. Friends and relatives planned to hold a celebration to offer congratulations.

<p>The China National Products Sales Joint Company was initiated by leaders from all sectors in Shanghai, such as Wang Xiaolai, Lin Kanghou, and Wu Zhihao, and representatives of products from various provinces who participated in the Chicago World's Fair. The initial plan is to carry out two major tasks: to promote cooperation in sales and production, cooperation in production and economy, and cooperation in economy and talent. The financial community in Shanghai has also expressed deep sympathy for assisting the national products business, and Qin Runqing, the leader of the money industry, has generously promised to provide 5 million yuan to assist in national products mortgages. Therefore, the company will surely be able to rely on the power of joint sales and the economic cooperation and sympathy of the financial community to achieve its true purpose of promoting national products. The company recently sent representatives Cun Jinpin and Wu Guangzhi to Nanjing, where they were introduced by Minister of Industry Chen Gongbo and Nanjing Mayor Shi Ying to host a banquet for key figures from various Yuan, ministries, and commissions of the National Government. Those present included Dai Chuanxian and Xie Gongwu of the Examination Yuan, Liang Hancao of the Legislative Yuan, Peng Xuepei of the Executive Yuan, Yu Luyi of the Control Yuan, Chen Lifu and Hong Tingyou of the Central Committee, Xie Guansheng of the Judicial Yuan, Wang Yongbin and Chen Baosun of the Examination Committee, Xu Shishi, Wang Pinggeng, and Hong Yulin of the Relief Committee, Zhou Yanming, Lin Youwang of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee, Tu Shijie, Qian Changxing, and Hao Gengsheng of the Ministry of Education, Luo Gonghua of the Ministry of Interior, Lin Biyu and Zhao Mingjiu of the Ministry of Personnel, Liu Weizhi, Tang Bo, Xu Haifan, Liu Ye, Wan Liangci, Huang Jinghan, Chen Bingquan, Li Xiaozhe, and Wang Yiyi of the Ministry of Industry, Lei Zhen and Zhou Bomin of the Municipal Party Headquarters, Lai Jinghu, Yang Zhoukang, Wang Shoupei, and Hou Sumin of the Municipal Government, Peng Bodong of the National Products Exhibition Hall, Wu Chengluo of the Bureau of Weights and Measures, Li Shuanghui, Li Yaotang, and Li Xianwan of the Overseas Chinese community in Nanjing, and Zhang Mengwen, Huang Cilun, Chen Hanqing, Chen Zuqiao, Peng Xitong, Wu Wenlan, and Lu Zutong, who are enthusiastic people in the business community, totaling more than 100 people. All of them subscribed to 500 yuan of shares on the spot to show their sincere cooperation. Minister Chen and Director Dai and others gave speeches during the banquet, vigorously advocating it.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Citizens' National Products Promotion Association believes that national products factories have suffered significant losses and were almost completely destroyed after the September 18th Incident. They are making every effort to design relief measures to restore the original state, benefit factories, and secure people's livelihoods. Now, hearing of the Fujian Incident, the country is in panic, financial stagnation is occurring, and production and sales are being damaged. Yesterday, at the third meeting of the 14th Standing Committee, it was decided to telegraph the 19th Route Army, requesting them to maintain their honor and avoid civil war. This appeal was made on behalf of national products factories across the country. The original telegram is recorded as follows: To Mr. Jiang Jingran and Mr. Cai Xianchu and all officers and soldiers of the 19th Route Army in Fuzhou: Your esteemed army is the army of our people, with a glorious history and admired by the whole country. In the Battle of Shanghai, you were loyal and courageous in saving the country, defending against invaders, and creating a new record of struggle for our national army. The national products factories belonging to our association, despite the situation of significant sacrifice, enthusiastically contributed in turn to comfort your hard work and express our respect. Now, reading the news, your esteemed army is about to start civil war due to different political views, which is shocking and deeply regrettable. Standing in the position of national products factories and the people, our association cannot bear to see your esteemed army's courage and honor lightly thrown away. We earnestly request that you find a proper solution, transform hostility into friendship, and not only will the national factories feel fortunate, but also ours. Respectfully conveying our sincere sentiments, we humbly request your adoption. Shanghai Citizens' National Products Promotion Association, Winter Seal.</p>

<h3 id="e122">Representatives of Shanghai-Nanjing-Suzhou Tobacco and Alcohol Industries Return to Shanghai <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>According to New Voice News, the representatives of the joint association of the Shanghai-Nanjing-Suzhou tobacco and alcohol industries, Yu Xunlu, Zhang Dalian, Zhang Suhou, Jin Yunjie, Gao Youming, Ru Baiquan, Cao Gexian, Wang Xinpu, and others, have returned to Shanghai after completing their petition in Beijing. According to a statement released by the representatives, the details of the Q&amp;A regarding the revision of the new tobacco and alcohol tax with Gu Aicang, director of the Tax Department of the Ministry of Finance, are as follows: (Question) The tax rates are unfair. (Answer) In the past, the public sales collection fee was 20% of the value of the goods. What is the percentage of the new tobacco and alcohol system? It has not been clearly announced, and merchants have doubts. (1) Shaoxing wine, new system, the production tax is 1.4 yuan, and the sales tax is 2 yuan. According to the previous public sales method, the production and sales each paid half of the tax. The new system actually collects 0.6 yuan. It is requested to reduce the sales tax rate by 0.6 yuan, so that it is equal to the production tax increase. (2) Imitation Shaoxing wine (this wine is a local yellow wine made by Shaoxing merchants in the Soviet Union) has always been taxed the same as local yellow wine because its raw materials are no different and its selling price is similar. Now the new system lists them in two categories. The tax on local yellow wine is 0.8 yuan, and the tax on imitation Shaoxing wine is 1.4 yuan, an increase of 0.6 yuan. It is requested to return it to one category so that it is taxed the same as local yellow wine. (3) Local yellow wine in Shanghai. Shanghai is a special area. The workshops are located in Pudong in the Chinese district. At the beginning of the public sale, there was no tax in the concessions, and tax was levied in the Chinese district, which was clearly discriminatory. Therefore, since the fourth year of the Republic of China, Hong Xiaochu, the director of Dunhou Hall of the industry, requested Xie Weitang, the sub-bureau chief of the Second District Tobacco and Alcohol Affairs Bureau, to submit a request to the provincial bureau to send personnel to investigate and adjust it. A special license (i.e., half-tax license) was issued so that the industry's merchants could pay tax and affix licenses for selling wine to the concessions, while still obtaining full licenses for sales to various ports in the Chinese district. This has been implemented for nearly 20 years. Now, the new system has failed to implement collection in the concessions, and goods are still tax-free. In the Chinese district, the half-tax license has been abolished and full tax has been forced to be levied, making it impossible for the industry's merchants to maintain their business, and they are about to declare closure. It is requested to show compassion and maintain the half-tax license. (Question) What is the situation of extortion along the way? (Answer) In the past, during the public sale period, the production site first reported half of the tax and obtained a waybill. After passing through, the waybill and goods matched and were released unimpeded. Until the sales site, the other half of the tax was reported. Now, however, the production and sales are collected together, and the tax certificate is actually affixed. There are all kinds of difficulties along the way, which are difficult to describe in words. It is only necessary to send personnel for secret investigation to know its numerous abuses. If this continues, how can merchants bear it? It is requested to strictly investigate and punish those who commit crimes to reassure the good. (Question) The penalties are too severe. What is the real situation? (Answer) In the past, the public sale was calculated by jar. Now the new system collects by volume. If the volume per jar is slightly different, it is actually the error of the local tax bureau and not the merchant taking advantage of it to evade tax. Even if strict measures are taken, it is possible to pay the tax according to the scene. Confiscation and punishment are not. It is requested to order the merchant to show compassion and exempt them from confiscation and punishment. (Question) What is meant by resembling double taxation? (Answer) The goods in stock have already paid the public sale fee and tax. Why is it necessary to change the rules and make up for the old and new? As with flour, yarn, matches, cement, etc. in the past, unified tax was levied without retroactive payment. This can be used as clear proof. Moreover, during the public sale period, merchants' goods in stock were established for buying and selling, and taxes were paid and licenses were obtained. Now, goods that have been forced to be manufactured must be taxed and licensed. The number is quite large, and merchants do not have the ability to bear it. The deadline for selling out in six months, the size of the merchant's business cannot be predetermined. After six months, will taxes be paid again? Moreover, the places where the goods are stored are humid, with insects and rats, and rain and wind. It is difficult to preserve the original condition of the affixed certificates, which will inevitably lead to disputes. It is requested to order that stocks be taxed and licensed at the time of sale. (Question) How is the treatment so different? (Answer) The quality of local tobacco leaves varies greatly. The best are smoked tobacco leaves, which can cost 70 to 80 yuan, or 40 to 50 yuan. The lowest are foot skin and autumn tobacco, which cost only 2 to 3 yuan. This kind of planting is for farmers. The new system taxes them all at the same rate of 4.15 yuan, which exceeds the cost and will inevitably cut off planting, affecting rural life and affecting social order. It is requested to classify and set taxes according to local wine to show fairness.</p>

<p>The right to use pilots at Chinese seaports, since the second article of the General Regulations on Pilotage at Various Seaports stipulated in the seventh year of Tongzhi, stipulates that all Chinese people and nationals of treaty countries who are willing to serve as pilots are allowed to serve equally. However, the right of examination is controlled by the examination bureau jointly organized by the shipping firms and various countries' consuls. Therefore, the number of people involved has become an example of holding a great power. Over the years, the right of successful candidates to serve as pilots in various seaports has disappeared. Navigation rights have been lost invisibly. In order to recover this management right, the government recently placed all pilotage associations in various ports along the river and coast under the jurisdiction of the government. It has also formulated 46 articles of Provisional Regulations on Pilotage Management to replace the previous General Regulations on Pilotage at Various Seaports. The following is about this:</p>

<p>Mr. Wu Changshuo of Anji, a master of morals, literature, and art, has returned to the immortal realm. Seven weeks have passed since his passing. Chinese and foreign art circles, along with his former students and old friends, initiated a seventh-week memorial. Jueyuan Temple was used as the site for the memorial service and an exhibition of his posthumous works. Yesterday, in addition to the memorial service, associates displayed their artistic talents. Their calligraphy and paintings evoked the movement of dragons and snakes, the engraving of metal and stone seemed to burst into life, and spirits guarded the works at night. The fame of his work spread far and wide. Blessed by the Creator, he was suitable for both old and young. How can we not mourn his passing, which occurred in this inauspicious year? Now, seven weeks have passed. We mourn his absence. His artistic spirit shall endure, and his descendants will carry on his legacy. May this offering be accepted. Besides the memorial service, famous figures from across the country, respected elders from the north and south, as well as European, American, and Japanese artists, attended the public memorial, with the number of attendees reaching around two thousand.

Some came from the collections of Europeans, Americans, and Japanese, while others came from the collections of his relatives. The walls were adorned with treasures, making it feel like entering a treasure mountain. The portrait of Mr. Wu in the hall was a continuation by Mr. Ren Bonian, with exquisite brushwork and dignified appearance. Mr. Shen Qiquan presided over the memorial service and personally wrote the eulogy, which read, "On the third day of the twelfth month of the twenty-second year of the Republic of China, Shen Wei and others respectfully offer wine, milk, incense, and fruit to the spirit of Mr. Wu of Canlu, saying: O Mr. Wu, your capacity was as vast as the sea and your burden as heavy as the earth. You had world-class ambition, but were confined. Now, freed from restraint, you are paired with the ancients, roaming the coastal areas, with poetry in your heart and wine on your lips." The Japanese also used floral arrangements and matcha tea, and played the flute and music. The ceremony was solemn and grand. Mr. Yamada Kenkichi wrote the eulogy during the memorial. After the service, Buddhist Guan Jiongzhi and a hundred lay Buddhists piously chanted scriptures. The Japanese Buddhist delegation and the monks of Jueyuan Temple all participated, making it a rare grand event in the art world.</p>

<p>The cotton and rice planted in the farmland of various districts of Shanghai County suffered two wind disasters, resulting in damage and poor harvest. The county government reported the situation to the provincial authorities. Subsequently, the Finance, Civil Affairs, and Construction Departments of the province sent commissioners to the county.

<p>The Shanghai branch of the Tianjin Continental Bank was established in the ninth year of the Republic of China.

It has been jointly operating with the Xingye, Yanye, Jincheng, and Zhongnan Banks for more than ten years, and has established a strong reputation. Now, because the original building on Tianjin Road is insufficient for office use, it has purchased land at No. 10 Jiujiang Road to build a new ten-story building, which is the most modern building in Shanghai. All floors above the second floor are for rent, and businesses and companies have been competing to rent them, and they have all been rented out. The bank itself occupies three floors, which are now fully completed. The facade is magnificent, the business counters are spacious, and the entire layout is fully equipped. The steel vault is exquisitely and sturdily built, with the latest locks made by famous American factories, which are tightly sealed. The bank has now completed all the arrangements, and it is said that the internal procedures have also been updated. The opening ceremony is scheduled for today. General Manager Xu Hanqing has already arrived in Shanghai from Tianjin to conduct the opening ceremony with Xie Fuxiao, the assistant manager stationed in Shanghai.

Shen Yiqian, the leader of the group, held an exhibition at the Public Education Center on Wenmiao Road to let the people of Shanghai understand the resources of Inner Mongolia. It opened on the first of this month, and many people have visited it in recent days. Because the lives of the Mongolians are different from those in the mainland, everyone is very interested. Yesterday, many new exhibits were added, all of which were colorful authentic pictures of the anti-Japanese bloody battles, as well as seven giant photographic works of the Mongolian border northwest that the group had previously drawn and exhibited in the Nanjing Central Auditorium. Yesterday, they were transported to Shanghai and added to the exhibition.

<p>Since the Fujian Incident, the party and government agencies in this city, considering Shanghai as an important town in the southeast, where people from all over the world gather, are deeply concerned that reactionary elements may be engaging in activities that could affect the overall situation. They have ordered the Public Security Bureau, the Guard Corps, and the Security Office to strengthen prevention. On the one hand, party departments at all levels are closely investigating propaganda publications. The Fifth District of the Jiangwan District Public Security Bureau has been ordered to start winter defense on December 1st. At the same time, the Guard Corps has also been decided by the State Council to hold winter defense from the 1st of this month to the end of February next year. A few days ago, the Municipal Office, the Public Security Bureau, the Guard Corps, the District Party Department, the Fire Brigade, and other agencies in the district jointly discussed joint defense measures and decided to establish the Seventh District Joint Defense Committee of Shanghai Municipality. The committee has two sections: general affairs and intelligence. The director of the general affairs section is appointed by the District Party Department, and the director of the intelligence section is appointed by the Fifth Section of the Fifth District.

<h3 id="e138">After Increased Donations for Apartments in the French Concession, Apartment Operators Petition to Maintain Original Donations: Trade Association Details Apartment Nature; Taxpayers Association Asks Authorities to Review <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>In the new western district of the French Concession, the number of apartment businesses has been increasing recently. Therefore, the French Municipal Council has created a new donation system for newly opened apartments, similar to that of small hotels. However, the fourteen oldest businesses, including Dahua, Dacheng, Dayi, Xinping, Kyoto, Huadong, Huabei, Dongfang, Tianjin, Wuling, Beijing, Central, Xindu, and Datong, were granted apartment licenses by the French authorities at the time and were recognized as formal apartments. Unexpectedly, because the Central, Datong, and Xindu apartments moved their locations, the investigators reported them as hotel properties. Therefore, since last month, they have been forced to change to hotel donations, which cost more than five times as much. The operators were shocked by the news and believed that they could not afford the huge expenses in this depressed era. If they refused to pay, the authorities would stop supplying water and electricity. Under the threat of water and electricity from the French authorities, the three apartments had to temporarily pay the donations and united with other businesses to continue their struggle. They also publicly elected representatives to petition the Chinese Taxpayers Association of the French Concession, requesting assistance. Chairman Du Yuesheng of the association allowed the apartment industry to detail the nature of apartments and hotels so that they could forward the request to the French authorities for review in order to reach a peaceful solution. The following is a copy of the Shanghai Apartment Trade Association's letter to Chairman Du Yuesheng of the French Concession Chinese Taxpayers Association: "Respected Chairman Yuesheng, our three apartment buildings were revoked their apartment business licenses by the French Municipal Council and were ordered to pay donations at the rate of hotels. We have already reported the dispute to you in person. Now, we would like to further detail the differences between apartments and hotels. The establishment of apartments was originally for social responsibility and to reduce the burden on travelers. It is roughly the same as the position of public offices and guild halls in various provinces and ports of our country. Since the central government moved its capital to Nanjing, Shanghai has become an important place for people from the guest industry to travel to and from. Moreover, there are more Chinese and foreigners living together and merchants gathering than in other places. Staying in hotels for a long time is constrained by the economy, and staying with relatives and friends is inconvenient. We have taken this into consideration and have chosen a convenient location in the French Concession with a more secluded location to set up apartments. The rent is similar to that of ordinary family landlords in Shanghai. Here are the main points: (1) The travelers who live in the apartments are all visiting relatives and friends, seeking work, or waiting for errands. They have no sufficient travel expenses available. (2) The room fees charged by the apartments are calculated on a monthly basis, which is both long-lasting and economical. If the travel expenses are insufficient, there is still room for sending letters to urge payment. (3) The apartments are free from all luxury items and do not have the furnishings and extravagance of hotels. The burden is naturally reduced, which is convenient for travelers with insufficient travel expenses. It feels like they have been living here for a long time and do not feel like they are guests. The above three points are the differences between apartments and hotels. On March 1, 1931, we requested the French Municipal Council to allow us to treat us equally and collect business taxes with reference to the management methods of boarding houses in various countries. We were approved to collect 2 taels of donation for every 100 taels of silver in rent. We have been in peace for many years. Until March of this year, the three apartments of our colleagues moved from Yuele Lane on Aiduya Road to Daode Lane on Baylor Road due to the landlord's renovation of the house and paid apartment taxes on a monthly basis for as long as three months. Unexpectedly, the French Municipal Council recently issued an emergency order, revoking the licenses of the three apartment buildings and ordering them to pay taxes according to the hotel tax rate, otherwise the water and electricity would be cut off. Our colleagues were unable to resist and had to pay the money in pain in order to maintain business. At a time when all industries in Shanghai are depressed, the French Municipal Council suddenly increased donations, which is not a policy to protect merchants and the people. Therefore, our colleagues respectfully present the facts to you, hoping that you will observe the lower sentiments and fight for a reason with the French Municipal Council to ask them to collect donations according to the original apartment donation regulations in order to care for the difficulties of merchants and maintain business. We are very eager to await your orders. The association has forwarded the letter to the French Municipal Council for review."</p>
<h3 id="e139">Investigation of Occupations of Japanese Residents in Shanghai: More Openings Than Closures; Japanese Newspaper Believes It Is Satisfactory <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>According to yesterday's Nihon Shinbun, the total number of Japanese residents in Shanghai's occupational status recently investigated by the tax inspector, the Japanese Consul General, and the police authorities is 3,885, an increase of 721 from last year. Among them, the largest increase is in coffee shops, restaurants, tea houses, soup noodle shops, prostitutes, barmaids, and dancers. There are 165 coffee shops and restaurants, 35 tea houses and soup noodle shops, 297 shops selling wine, soy sauce, and other food products, 275 prostitutes, 245 dancers, 163 barmaids, 98 nurses, and 95 barbers. Since the Japanese exchange rate has plummeted and competition among operators has intensified, the number of operators opening businesses has been more enthusiastic than those closing down. This is also a good sign for the future of Japanese businessmen.</p>

<p>Du Yuesheng was originally elected as the chairman of the Fresh Fish Industry Association of this city. However, Du resigned from the chairmanship of the association due to his busy schedule. The association repeatedly sent people to persuade him to stay, but Du's resignation was firm and he did not agree to their request, which resulted in the industry's business being chaotic and its unity disintegrated. People in the fish industry believed that if this continued, it would not be good for the industry's future and welfare. Therefore, after a general discussion, they prepared a public letter yesterday and dispatched industry leaders Fang Jiaobo, Huang Zhenshe, Fang Guoliang, Yu Yongchang, Zhu Bao, Wu Xintai, and others to Du's residence on Huage Road to personally ask him to withdraw his resignation. It is said that Du was moved by the industry's earnest request and has agreed to take office and will go to the association to inspect matters within the next few days.</p>

<h3 id="e146">Seafeng Flour Company Fire: Manager Xu Hecheng Accused - Shareholders Demand Rights Due to Suspected Embezzlement of Insurance Funds <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>In Xinfu, Haizhou, there is the Seafeng Flour Company, established during the late Qing Dynasty's Guangxu period, with a total capital of 300,000 yuan. Its first manager was Xu Jiuxiang, who managed it for over a decade, and the business was quite prosperous. After Jiuxiang passed away from illness, his younger brother Xu Hecheng took over the position, and there were no complaints. However, in September of this year, the company suddenly suffered a fire. All assets except for the boilers and furnaces were destroyed, resulting in significant losses. Fortunately, the company had fire insurance, and after the incident, received compensation of 115,000 silver dollars, which Xu Hecheng, Zhu Youqin, Bao Zidan, and others received and deposited in the Bank of Communications on Jielu in this city. They also placed a notice in the newspaper to thank the insurance company. At that time, Wang Xiaowu, a shareholder of Seafeng, saw the wording of the advertisement and found it unusually vague, suspecting that they were trying to embezzle the funds. He, in his capacity as a shareholder or auditor, negotiated with Xu, demanding that he hand over all the insurance funds and historical account books for auditing. However, Xu repeatedly evaded the request and was even suspected of absconding with the money. Therefore, in order to protect their rights, they urgently hired lawyers Zhan Jifeng and Zhan Yigang to file a criminal self-accusation against Xu Hecheng, stating that his succession as manager was not approved by all shareholders and was in fact a theft of office. His leasing of the company was also done without shareholder consent. Furthermore, his attempt to embezzle the insurance funds constituted a violation of Article 356 of the Criminal Law for embezzlement and Article 363 for fraud. They requested that he be promptly arrested, punished according to the law, and ordered to repay the share capital of 91,420 silver dollars, as well as statutory interest. The plaintiff also feared that Xu Hecheng would withdraw the funds deposited in the Bank of Communications, so they specifically requested the court to issue an order to the bank to prohibit Xu Hecheng, Zhu Youqin, Bao Zidan, and others from spending the funds before the case was concluded, in order to protect their claims. The other day, Judge Zhan Liangce of the First Special District Court held a hearing to summon the defendant Xu Hecheng for questioning. Xu Hecheng stated that he was elected as a liquidator by the board of directors in 1918, so he handled the company's lease and received the insurance compensation according to his authority, and it was not an unauthorized action. However, the plaintiff claimed that the defendant's liquidation duties were for clearing his brother's debts and that he was not actually elected by the shareholders. After mutual arguments, Judge Zhan ruled that the case was of great importance and beyond the jurisdiction of the lower court, and ordered it to be transferred to the local court for scheduled trial.</p>

Therefore, Liang came to Shanghai the day before yesterday to discuss the matter with his friends. Upon receiving the report, Officer Tang immediately directed the detectives to disguise themselves and head to the intersection of Daxi Road.

<p>Yesterday morning at around 8:00 AM, a robbery occurred on Xizang Road in the Public Concession. Afterwards, the robbers, fearing pursuit, retreated into Minbei and shot and injured three policemen. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e153">Six Robbers Arrive <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>Zhou Bocun, a local resident, lives in the east wing of No. 4, Lane 55 (Huatongfang) on Xizang Road in the Public Concession. He works as an accountant in the Shunfeng Securities Company at No. 11, Tong'an Lane, Hankou Road. Because of the proximity to the exchange, Zhou also privately engaged in government bond trading. Over the years, he has accumulated some wealth, which attracted the attention of robbers. Yesterday morning, at around 7:00 AM, Zhou was still in bed due to the Sunday holiday when six robbers suddenly arrived outside his door. Four of them carried handguns, and two stood guard at the front and back doors. One robber guarded the door of the east wing, while the other three, also armed, broke into Zhou's bedroom, woke up everyone in the house, drove them to a corner, and held them captive. They said to Zhou, "Recently, you have been making a lot of money selling government bonds, so we have come to borrow some. Hand over the money quickly, or these guns are merciless." Seeing the situation, Zhou argued with them, but the robbers were aggressive and would not listen. Zhou Bocun had no choice but to hand over the keys and let them search.</p>
<h3 id="e154">Shouting for Robbers from Upstairs <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>After obtaining the keys, the robbers opened the dressing table and drawers in the room. They found 20 silver dollars in cash and a gold ring worth 23 dollars, which they immediately took. Then, seeing that there was nothing else of value, they forced Zhou to hand over the keys to the chests. While they were arguing, the robber guarding the people in the room relaxed his vigilance slightly. Zhou's maid saw an opportunity and escaped, running to the second landlord's attic in the back, waking up the second landlord Pan Xianting and his wife. They reported the robbery. Upon hearing this, Pan and his wife hurriedly got out of bed, closed the door tightly, pushed open the window facing the street, blew the whistle wildly, and shouted for help to catch the robbers. The robbers, hearing this, knew that they had been exposed and were extremely frightened. They quickly turned around, went downstairs, and fled towards the front door. However, nearby police officers patrolling the area near Xizang Road had also been alerted and gathered. Seeing this, the robbers, fearing arrest, quickly turned around, crossed the bridge, and fled towards the Guoqing Road area in the Chinese territory.</p>
<h3 id="e155">Shooting Along the Way <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>Seeing this, the Chinese police officers in the Public Concession, fearing that the robbers would escape, quickly blew their whistles to notify the police officers in the Chinese territory to cooperate in the pursuit. At that time, Zhang Dakui, police officer No. 23 from the Fourth District Police Station at the intersection of Guqing Road and Wuzhen Road, happened to be on duty. He first heard the alarm, and then saw five or six people running towards Wuzhen Road, realizing that they were not good people. He quickly raised his gun and ordered them to stop. However, the robbers had already noticed him and opened fire on Police Officer Zhang first. Zhang's thigh was hit, and the bullet entered his abdomen but did not exit. At the time, the police officer did not realize it and continued to pursue them relentlessly, until he reached the vicinity of Yangzheng Beili on Manzhou Road, where he collapsed due to excessive bleeding. Seeing that they had caused trouble, the robbers quickly turned west and fled into Dunmu Lane. One of the robbers, because he was wearing a long gown, found it difficult to run and took off his Zhigong woolen camel hair gown and abandoned it at the entrance of the lane to escape. This was seen by Zhou Peixin, police officer No. 24 stationed nearby, who quickly fired a shot, intending to arrest him. However, he was also shot by the robber, the bullet hitting his right abdomen and exiting from his back, causing him to fall to the ground with serious injuries.</p>
<h3 id="e156">Bullets Flying <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>Seeing that they had caused two incidents in a row, the robbers became panicked and fled out of Dunmu Lane in a hurry, hiding near the Rice Merchant Association. However, this was also the post of Police Officer Liu Qingren, No. 25, who was already lying in wait. Therefore, a fierce battle broke out between the police and the robbers, with bullets flying and pedestrians fleeing. However, the number of the robbers was few, and there was no support. Therefore, before long, Police Officer Liu was shot down again, the bullet entering his right waist and exiting from his rear thigh. The robbers were able to escape and fled in different directions on North Xinmin Road, without being apprehended. By the time the Chinese police officers from the Public Concession arrived, the robbers had already fled far away. After the Fourth District Headquarters heard the alarm, they quickly dispatched a large number of armed police officers. The fire rescue ambulance dispatched by the concession had arrived earlier and had already rushed the three injured policemen to the Baolong Hospital on Baker Road for treatment. Soon after, Detectives Tang En and Qiu Jingfan from the Huishi Police Station personally went to the scene of the incident to investigate and brought back the long gown abandoned by the robbers and several shell casings found at the scene to the police station for filing. They dispatched detectives to pursue the robbers everywhere. Among the injured police officers, Zhang Dakui's situation was the most critical. Zhang is from Shandong and is 31 years old. Zhou Peixin is from Nanjing and is 32 years old. Liu Qingren is 24 years old and from Shandong. Although the injuries of these two are not minor, their lives can be saved.</p>
<p>(41 years old), Jiang Yitao, (18 years old), Shen Dishan, (28 years old), the female gangster Wang Shenshi, 38 years old, who is the wife of the fugitive mastermind Wang Jintao, and Shen Shenshi, (59 years old), were all arrested and taken to the Sixth District Police Station for questioning separately. The father of the kidnapped boy, Liang Guangyu, learned at 4:00 PM that his son had been rescued and reported everything to the Sixth District, etc.</p>
<h3 id="e157">Tragic Incident of Killing Son in the Western District of Shanghai - Ma Mengzhou Stabs His Son with a Gun - Ma Fuxin Confesses It Was His Father <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>Ma Mengzhou, a local resident of Shanghai, 49 years old, residing at No. 19, Majiajiao, Hongqiao Road, Western District of Shanghai, is a farmer. He is usually diligent and thrifty, so his family is quite well-off. His wife, Tang, has three sons. The eldest, Fuxin, is 25 years old, born to his first wife, Wang. He used to typeset at a printing house and is married to a woman named Zhang. The second son, Fuxiang, is 22 years old. The youngest, Fuhong, is 14 years old. Mengzhou has an elderly father, Zhonghuan, who is over seventy years old and in good spirits. The family is harmonious. However, Fuxin does not work properly and has become depraved. He has secretly mortgaged the family property and squandered it all, so Mengzhou and his wife hate him deeply. In January of this year, they sent Fuxin to the Caohejing Work Training Center for vagrants and imprisoned him for six months. He was released only last month, but Fuxin still does not repent and associates with rogues, which aroused Mengzhou's intention to kill his son. Moreover, Tang strongly encouraged him. Therefore, at around 8:00 PM the night before, Mengzhou, carrying a very sharp ancient-style long gun, waited on the side of the road opposite Mengjiangtang on Hopeland Road. Before long, Fuxin staggered along, drunk and disoriented. Mengzhou, taking him by surprise, raised the gun and stabbed Fuxin directly in the heart, stabbing him three times. Two of the stabs were in the chest, about an inch deep. The last stab was in the shoulder. Because the gun head fell off, it only slightly broke the skin. Seeing that the attacker was his father, Fuxin jumped into the river beside the road and shouted for help. Mengzhou then fled with the gun pole. At this time, Zeng Shipu, the chief of the Wangjialou Police Station, was patrolling and heard the shout. He went to the scene and rescued Ma Fuxin. He also picked up a handleless sharp gun about eight inches long, stained with blood, on the ground and brought it back to the station. After Chief Zeng questioned him about who the attacker was and how he was attacked, Ma Fuxin initially refused to tell the truth. After repeated strict questioning, he finally revealed that the attacker was his father, Ma Mengzhou. After obtaining the confession, the chief, seeing that the injuries were very serious, sent him to the Red Cross Hospital on Hague Road by car for treatment. He also arrested the attacker, Ma Mengzhou, along with the murder weapon, and sent them to the First Branch of the Sixth District in Beixinjing, and then transferred them to the City Public Security Bureau for interrogation, etc.</p>

<p>Chen Ronggui, a Suzhou native residing at Tianlu Shoe Store, 126 Old School Field in the city, worked at the Miye Foreign Firm on Guangdong Road. On May 12 of this year, at around 5:00 PM, he was returning home from work. When he passed by No. 6, Diandang Street in the French Concession, which is the back door of the Old Jiatai Tea Shop on Old North Gate Avenue, a piece of wood fell from the tea shop's three-story drying platform and hit him on the head. He died despite medical treatment, leaving behind his elderly mother, Chen Zhangshi (blind in both eyes), his widowed wife, Huang, five children, and his unmarried sister who remained chaste. The entire family was left with no means of support. Chen's widow, Chen Huangshi, hired a lawyer to file a criminal self-accusation with the Second Special District Court, accusing the owner of the Old Jiatai Tea Shop, Pan Jucai, and the manager, Ye Jishan, of causing death by negligence. In addition to requesting an investigation, she also filed a civil lawsuit seeking 50,000 yuan in damages. The case was repeatedly summoned but not concluded. Chen's wife, Huang, the plaintiff, died of worry and grief in August. Chen's elderly mother, Chen Zhangshi, then hired a lawyer to file a motion with the court to participate. The details of the court hearing have been reported in previous newspapers. After the case was tried, the defendants were found not guilty. Because the plaintiff's side disagreed with the original verdict, they filed an appeal with the Third Branch of the Jiangsu High Court. The High Court accepted the appeal and, the other day at 4:00 PM, Court President Guo Dezhang, along with Judges Fan and Li, and Prosecutor Zhang, specially opened the Third Criminal Court to hear the case. Both parties attended with their lawyers, and Wang Licheng, the police detective who handled the case, was summoned to testify about the details of the investigation. The lawyers for both parties argued fiercely for the benefit of their clients. After the hearing lasted until about 6:00 PM, the court announced the end of the debate and adjourned to schedule a date for the verdict.</p>

<h3 id="e160">Another Perpetrator, Chen Xiaobiao, Apprehended in the Yan Azhang Murder Case <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>Yan Azhang (also known as Li Azhang), a native of Ningbo, was close friends with a fellow villager named A Hua. Azhang had a handgun that was borrowed for robbery, and the proceeds were spent. Later, when he asked for it back, they quarreled. Azhang planned to secretly report the robbery to the police. A Hua found out about this and hatched a malicious plan. On the evening of August 22, at around 9:00 PM, he, along with Xiang Xiasheng, Chen Qinxi, Zhang Quan, and Xiaobiao, tricked him into going to a remote place on Guiyang Road. A Hua then shot Azhang in a vital spot with the gun, causing him to fall to the ground. Zhang Quan and Chen Qinxi then stripped him of his pants and pushed him into a nearby creek. He was later found by detectives from the Yangshupu Police Station, who pulled him up and sent him to the hospital, where he died despite treatment. Xiang Xiasheng and Chen Qinxi were arrested one after another and sent to the First Special District Court. Xiang was sentenced to three years in prison, and Chen was sentenced to life imprisonment. The details have been reported in this newspaper. The other day, detectives Jin Wanrong and Su Changsheng from the Yulin Road Police Station found out that Chen Xiaobiao was hiding at No. 35, Renxing Street, Yangshupu Road. They secretly went to the address and arrested him. He was identified as 25 years old, from Shaoxing, and taken to the police station for detention. The next morning, he was sent to the Third Criminal Court. Zhang Tianyin, the lawyer for the police station, stated the previous circumstances and said that the defendant initially denied that his name was Xiaobiao, saying that it was Chen Xilin. However, a cook from the Shanghai Third Yarn Factory identified him as Xiaobiao, and he finally admitted his guilt. He also admitted that Chen Qinxi and Zhang Quan had come to his house three times to ask him to join. He previously lived at No. 523 in the factory's workshop. He said that he could not bring the other two convicted criminals, Xiang and Chen, to court today and requested a postponement. When questioned, Chen Xiaobiao confessed that he knew the deceased Azhang and Chen Qinxi and Zhang Quan. Zhang Quan had brought a handgun to his house to keep it temporarily and asked him to help kill Azhang. At that time, Chen Qinxi refused. Later, Ruo Gong came three times, and he agreed in a moment of confusion. He walked with Azhang and others to the scene of the incident and suddenly heard a gunshot, but he did not know who fired it. The rest of his statement was evasive. Judge Liu Yugui ordered him to be remanded in custody and scheduled a new hearing.</p>

<p>Zhu Bajie Goes to Suzhou to Find a Bride There are Zhu Si and Zhu Shi in Shanghai, nicknamed Zhu Bajie. After getting married in the Water Curtain Cave in Suzhou, the princess in the cave was furious upon hearing the news and led eight hairballs to make a big fuss in the Pansidong (Spider Cave). Sun Wukong was informed and led the little demons to Suzhou to rescue Zhu Bajie. Sha Heshang heard the news and reported to Tang Sanzang. Tang Seng was furious and sent Sha Heshang to arrest Zhu Si and Zhu Shi. The Bull Demon King interceded and ordered the two Zhus to come to Shanghai immediately and be punished with three days of free performances. This play will be staged in Shanghai soon.</p>

<p>The Qingqing Bee Farm captured a strange turtle near Tangqi. Its body is vermilion in color. According to the villagers, it is transformed from a venomous snake, also known as a snake-bite turtle. Its venom is unparalleled and rarely seen in modern times. It is now being transported to Shanghai by the owner of the farm and will be displayed for three days at the Art Department of the LILI Company on the second floor of 32 Sijing Road. All are welcome to visit, study, and research it.</p>

<h3 id="e188">Wedding Hazing and Toasting Cigarettes <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>— Qiao</p>
<p>Despite claims that marriage has become civilized, many traditional customs and etiquette persist.</p>
<p>When a new bride arrives at the bridal chamber, relatives and friends must engage in lively and boisterous hazing. As the old saying goes, "For the first three days, there's no seniority; even grandfathers can jump on the bed like tigers." Hazing is considered an essential part of enjoying a wedding feast. In the past, examining the bride's bound feet was a common activity. Now, with the revolution, asking the bride to sing "Drizzling Rain" and shake hands with the groom is considered progress, perhaps? The host of the wedding faces a dilemma: if there is no hazing, it seems too quiet and dull. Another old saying states, "Hazing brings prosperity." There's a bit of philosophy in the idea that prosperity follows hazing. However, if the hazing becomes too aggressive, it's awkward to step in and stop it. Consequently, humorous incidents often occur. It seems that not long ago, a bloody incident resulted from excessive hazing in Xuzhou.</p>
<p>The people of Suzhou, after all, are more relaxed. They always use the excuse of asking for "lucky fruits," tying all conditions to these fruits. If the wedding guests are clever and the bridesmaids are adaptable, generously distributing the lucky fruits and responding with smooth and tactful answers, major issues can be turned into minor ones, and minor ones into nothing at all. The safety of the bridal chamber can be maintained. Therefore, selecting bridesmaids has become an important matter when marrying off a daughter.</p>
<p>Since the male side's well-wishers have created such a chaotic atmosphere for the bride, the female side's well-wishers cannot show weakness. Thus, when the bride returns to her family home, they seize the opportunity to retaliate by toasting the groom repeatedly. If the groom has a soft tongue, he simply cannot cope. Some even learn to kneel and offer wine like Gao Lishi, enduring more than they can bear, yet feeling uneasy about rejecting it. It's more difficult than anything. If the new guests (it's a miracle if a female guest accompanies the groom at the banquet) are skilled in rhetoric or can drink a little on his behalf, it's easier to defuse the situation. However, according to Suzhou custom, the groom cannot leave before the guests have dispersed. Therefore, there are humorous stories of hazing that lasts until dawn, with the groom becoming so drunk that he loses consciousness.</p>
<p>I'm only speaking from the perspective of Suzhou; I don't know how it is elsewhere, but it's likely even more lively than Suzhou. In my opinion, everything should be moderate and not excessive. Both wedding hazing and toasting can add interest and inject a bit of liveliness into the solemn wedding ceremony. If taken too seriously, it can become disappointing and dull.</p>
<h3 id="e189">Rice Bowl <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>— Feng Moni</p>
<p>During my free time each day, I often help out at the tobacco and paper shop downstairs run by a friend, selling cigarettes, which I find quite interesting and a way to pass the time. However, every day there are always a few beggars who come to ask for cigarette boxes. At first, I didn't quite understand why they wanted the cigarette boxes. Later, when they came to ask for them, I asked them what they were used for. They replied: "We want cigarette boxes to use as rice bowls, so we come to bother you every day, sir." After hearing their words, I finally understood that using cigarette boxes as rice bowls meant they were truly destitute.</p>
<p>Eating is indeed a very complex matter, but the rice bowl used for eating is also not easy to obtain. In wealthy families, rice bowls are naturally not a problem. Gilt-edged rice bowls and silver-flowered rice bowls can be chosen at will. Occasionally, they are displeased with a coarse ceramic rice bowl and cannot even swallow the rice, so they scold the servants and replace it with a more elaborate bowl. There are many people like this. Having money, of course, one must put on airs; otherwise, it wouldn't be enough to show off their young master's temperament. For a person to eat, a rice bowl is naturally indispensable, but why be so particular about it? It is the rice that is being eaten, not the bowl. As for being unable to eat the rice when using a coarse rice bowl, it is truly a ridiculous and absurd story, and it is also a demonstration of the inferior character of Chinese young masters. If wealthy young masters were invited to take a stroll through a slum, they would certainly shake their heads in astonishment and say: "Why is hygiene not emphasized here? They eat with those blackish-gray blue-and-white bowls. It's such a strange thing."</p>
<p>Even wealthy people who use gilt-edged rice bowls still distinguish between the quality of the ceramics, while beggars cannot even afford coarse rice bowls and use cigarette boxes instead. Comparing the two is like comparing heaven and hell. Although everyone's circumstances are different, they should be deeply aware of the plight of the poor and should not put on such airs. A person may be wealthy in this lifetime, but if circumstances change one day, then everything will feel unsatisfactory. Therefore, wealthy people have delicacies such as bird's nest and sea cucumber, but only eat half a bowl of rice, either frowning and saying they have no appetite or pressing their chest and saying they have chest pain. Beggars eat the leftovers and scraps of others and still survive with vitality, and they never worry about hygiene or have illnesses like lack of appetite or chest pain. Perhaps the physical constitution of these two types of people is different?</p>
<h3 id="e190">Yellow Hollyhock Storage Method <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>— Tianxu Wosheng</p>
<p>The most reliable method of storage is to first wash the mud off, crush it, and without drying, pack it into kerosene cans. Each can should hold twenty-five catties, and every four cans make one dan. Then, pour "aldehyde solution" (i.e., formaldehyde) into the gaps to completely immerse it. Then seal it with solder. It can be stored until the following year, but do not let air leak out; it will never spoil.</p>
<p>Aldehyde solution is also known as "one-carbon intermediate liquid," translated as "Formalin." A pure product only needs one percent to preserve for more than six months. However, the "Formalin" sold on the market contains only about 40 percent formaldehyde (CH20), and the rest is (H2O), ordinary water, which does not contain carbon gas. Therefore, it needs to be used with four percent, that is, one pound of "Formalin" should be mixed with twenty-five pounds of water to preserve it until the following year without spoiling. Formalin is sold in various instrument shops, but the price listed in the price list is two dollars and fifty cents per pound. If you buy it from industrial raw material stores, the price is cheaper, but it must be in the original barrel. Retail purchases are about eighty cents or one dollar. If there is no place to buy it, you can buy it from the pulp factory, then ten pounds and five pounds can be used, each dan of hollyhock root only uses one pound.</p>
<p>(Note) The soil must be washed clean. If it is not washed clean, the leaching liquid will have black spots that cannot be removed and cannot be used by paper mills.</p>
<p>This year, because growers are devaluing themselves and selling cheaply, each dan has fallen from six yuan to three yuan. However, users are stored in cellars and cannot buy a year's worth of goods at one time. It is estimated that by February and March of next year, they will all complain and switch to using sorghum flowers. If hollyhock roots can be bought, and if it sells for five or six yuan per dan, which is cheaper than sorghum flowers, they will of course still use hollyhock roots. It is possible to set a price limit, register the number of dan with the utilization plant, and introduce it to users at any time, so that both supply and demand can be facilitated, and the unhealthy wind of competition can be avoided, so as not to kill each other.</p>
<h3 id="e191">Record of Parting with Autumn at Tianchi (Part 2) <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Qianjiu</p>
<p>Descending further, we ascended another peak. A huge rock resembled a drum, hence the name Stone Drum Peak. The gazetteer states: "When the drum sounds, it signifies a year of misfortune." Alas, we have not heard the drum sound for a long time. Is this truly a peaceful and prosperous age? On the drum, there is another enormous rock, wide at the top and narrow at the bottom, with its peak extending more than ten feet beyond its base, reaching a height of about a hundred feet. Looking up, one could lose one's hat; viewed from the side, it resembled a frog raising its head, hence the name Frog Peak. The size of the frog gives an idea of the size of the Stone Drum. Returning to the temple gate via the old path, the so-called Tianchi had already been spoiled by Yi Jun's search for obstructions. The lotus flowers were now gone, leaving only duckweed. Ni Jun and Lan Jun took photos beside it, while Fen Jun stood silently with her head bowed, as if in thought. Ning Jun said, "We've already taken the tour, what's there to think about?" She happily waded barefoot into Tianchi, youthful exuberance captured in a photo. At that time, the autumn sun was still in the mountains, but dusk was deepening. We returned to the boat along the original route, the evening glow on our oars painting a particularly desolate scene of autumn. I believe that the beauty of Tianchi lies solely in its stones, and the beauty of its stones is unmatched elsewhere. Therefore, I record a chapter of Yuan Gu Zhongying's poem "Traveling to Tianchi" as its epilogue:</p>
<p>Winding white cloud path,</p>
<p>Elegant green mountains linked.</p>
<p>Autumn wind blows travelers' robes,</p>
<p>Free spirit fluttering.</p>
<p>Grasping vines, crossing sheer cliffs,</p>
<p>Stepping on stairs, reaching the highest peak.</p>
<p>Cliffs tilting, stones about to fall,</p>
<p>Trees broken, clouds reconnecting.</p>
<p>Two peaks gnawing at each other's gates,</p>
<p>What vastness within the valley!</p>
<p>Great mountains towering,</p>
<p>Almost scraping the blue sky.</p>
<p>Small mountains also rugged,</p>
<p>Flying along in front.</p>
<p>Darkly accumulating ancient iron,</p>
<p>Brightly blooming blue lotus.</p>
<p>Divine axe carving emerald bones,</p>
<p>Heavenly pond holding spiritual spring.</p>
<p>Jade dragon embraces a cold mirror,</p>
<p>Reflected clear autumn hangs.</p>
<p>Remember Zhang Zhenju of old,</p>
<p>Sent me a dazzling poem.</p>
<p>The past cannot be made again,</p>
<p>New poems tied as a tradition.</p>
<p>Raise wine to toast the white sun,</p>
<p>Ten thousand valleys give birth to desolate smoke.</p>
<p>Hidden joy bitterly insufficient,</p>
<p>Sunset suddenly moves.</p>
<p>Why do the beauties not come?</p>
<p>Mountains and waters empty and beautiful.</p>

<p>Chapter Nineteen: Desiring to Depart but Hesitant, Recalling the Past in the Same Car; Half-Crying, Half-Laughing, Leaning on the Pillow in the Lingering Autumn</p>
<p>Speaking in this way, one really shouldn't. One must find this opportunity to say a few words to him. Even if one cannot marry him, one might as well comfort him a little. A woman's heart cannot be shaken; once shaken, there's no way to recover it. Guizhi harbored a sense of indebtedness to Ji Zhi, and she often inquired whether Ji Zhi had any news of returning. In the blink of an eye, it was the summer holidays. Thinking that Ji Zhi would definitely return at this time, she would often pass by the Gan family's door to see if there was any sign of him. Soon two months passed, and the summer holidays were over. It was already the autumn semester. When idle, Ji Zhi also does not return. After the start of school, such a long distance, why does he have to kneel and return? Then he will not be expected. Counting the days, it has been five months since Zhao Ziqiang went to Xifengkou. In those five months, he has sent back over ten letters, about two letters home each month. Although he wrote family letters, much of what he wrote on the letters was to comfort his in-laws. The letter said that he had only received three paychecks, and each time he received a paycheck, he sent them all back, saying that in Xifengkou, there was nowhere to spend the money, and there was a surplus in the office expenses, which was enough to maintain a person's life. Old Man Zhao's attitude was very fair. When his son sent the money home, he would divide half of it to the Yang family. At first, Jiang Shi was unwilling to accept and use it, but Old Man Zhao said that a wedding was definitely going to be held in the second half of the year. Take it and buy some clothing for your eldest daughter to prepare as a wedding dress. Jiang Shi knew that the old man was sincere, so she accepted it. This was in mid-September of the lunar calendar. The weather in the north was slowly getting colder. The sound of cars going to the Western Hills outside the gate was becoming more frequent and lively. It turned out that these were idlers going to the Western Hills to see the red leaves. Every year at this time, they always have to be busy for a while. (258)</p>

<h3 id="e193">Air, Wind <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>— Bing Yu</p>
<p>The air surrounding the Earth is approximately four hundred kilometers thick. The pressure of the air is called atmospheric pressure, which varies with time and location. When you hear the phrase "760 millimeters of high atmospheric pressure" on the radio, it means that the average atmospheric pressure at sea level on flat ground. The atmospheric pressure is relatively lower in hotter regions, higher latitudes, and on mountains. For example, at the summit of Mount Himalayas, the average is only about 500 millimeters. This atmospheric pressure means that on average, every square meter of surface is covered by ten thousand kilograms of weight. When foreign children are playing noisily outdoors, their parents often scold them, saying, "Low pressure is coming." This statement has a factual basis, unlike the superstitious peasants in our country who scare children by saying that tigers or ghosts are coming. What is low pressure? It means that rain and snow are coming. These winds, rain, and snow surround the Earth's surface to a height of about fifteen kilometers. Areas of high pressure have a lot of air, while areas of low pressure have less air, but areas with a lot of high pressure are also small. The air in areas of low pressure, whether liquid or gas, maintains its shared property, becoming wind due to the movement of air. However, the changes between high and low pressure are due to unequal temperatures in the atmosphere. The wind varies with the seasons: the gentle spring breeze, the cool summer breeze, the sharp autumn wind, and the fierce winter wind – these are the winds of the four seasons in general. However, the speed of the wind varies: if the wind speed is only 0.3 meters per second or less, the sea surface will not ripple, and the smoke released from factory chimneys will rise straight up. However, the atmosphere is constantly changing, and the wind speed often changes, resulting in distinctions between: (1) breeze, (2) light air, (3) light breeze, (4) gentle breeze, (5) moderate breeze, (6) fresh breeze, (7) strong breeze, (8) near gale, (9) gale, (10) strong gale, (11) storm, (12) hurricane. A breeze has a wind speed between 0.4 meters and 1.5 meters per second, and the smoke from the chimney will be seen to sway. A light air has a speed of 1.6 meters to 3.3 meters per second, and we feel the wind on our faces in the suburbs, and small waves appear on the sea surface. A light breeze has a speed of 3.4 meters to 5.4 meters per second, and when this wind blows, the branches and leaves of trees sway, and hanging flags flutter. A gentle breeze has a speed of 5.5 meters or more and 7.9 meters or less, and when a gentle breeze arises, dust from the ground can be stirred up, and whitecaps appear on the sea surface. A moderate breeze is between 8 meters and 17 meters per second, and when a moderate breeze rises, the leaves rustle as they are blown down, and in the forest, the leaves feel like they are about to sway. A fresh breeze has a speed of 10.8 meters to 13.8 meters per second, and when a fresh breeze rises, the waves on the water surface roll high, and the wires on the utility poles and branches sway up and down and left and right. A strong breeze is faster than a fresh breeze, about 17 meters per second, and when it blows in our faces, it feels like it will blow us over when we were children. A near gale has a speed of 27.8 meters per second, and small branches are often broken by it. Even adults can be blown over, and the waves on the water surface often splash into boats. A gale has a wind speed of about 24.4 meters per second, with the force to break small trees. Ships in harbors must be protected from capsizing, and the roofs of thatched houses are often blown away. The speed of a strong gale is even more severe, between 24.5 meters and 28.4 meters per second. When this wind blows, even large trees are blown down. A storm is even more terrible, with a wind speed of about 33.5 meters per second. Low houses are often blown down, and adults cannot stand on the road. Ships that pass through the sea during a storm are not spared from capsizing, because when a storm arises, the waves on the sea surface are stirred up, coming like an overwhelming force, and are very fierce. A hurricane is the most violent of all winds. Everyone must have understood the damage our country suffered from the hurricane this year. If a steamer at sea sails into the eye of the hurricane, it will either capsize or be lifted high. The above-mentioned twelve types of wind are distinguished according to wind speed. There are other speeds with various names, namely: (1) trade winds, (2) monsoon winds, (3) evening breeze, (4) morning breeze, (5) land and sea breezes, (6) mountain breezes, (7) gusts, (8) tornadoes, (9) breezes, etc. Due to space limitations, I cannot explain them one by one now.</p>

<h3 id="e194">Jiangsu Second District Social Education Research Association Annual Meeting Passes Proposals <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing Correspondence) The Jiangsu Second District Social Education Research Association held its first annual meeting on the morning of the 2nd. In addition to discussing four proposals regarding people's schools and two proposals regarding township improvement associations, as reported previously, there was also a proposal from the Yizheng People's Education Center on how to enable the people to receive a strong influence of civic education. It was resolved that the provincial education center in this district should purchase one or two film projectors to tour the counties in this district to promote propaganda. Regarding cooperative undertakings: (1) the provincial Tangshan Agricultural Education Center proposed actively promoting cooperative undertakings. The following methods were resolved: 1. People's schools should increase cooperative training. 2. Actively compile popular reading materials on promoting cooperative undertakings. 3. Since the Shanghai Bank established an agricultural loan department, other banks such as JinCheng and China Bank also have a tendency to extend loans to rural areas. The funds for cooperative undertakings should not feel lacking again. In order to enable the banks to fully trust social education institutions and the personnel in charge of social education institutions and to be willing to bear this responsibility, it seems necessary to submit a request to the Department of Education to stipulate the term of service for directors of social education institutions. (2) The Tangshan Agricultural Education Center proposed that the funds allocated to people's education institutions should be used for the funds of credit cooperatives. It was resolved to pass the proposal and submit it to the Department of Education to issue an order to the education bureaus and sections of various counties to include this fund in the budget for the next year. At this point in the discussion, there was a break for lunch.</p>
<p>The meeting continued at 2:00 PM to discuss matters regarding agricultural affairs and sideline improvement: (1) "The Tangshan Agricultural Education Center proposed that people's education institutions should organize youth agricultural groups to implement livelihood education." The following methods were resolved: 1. People's education institutions should establish one pilot group among youth chicken farming groups, pig farming groups, cotton planting groups, vegetable planting groups, and chrysanthemum planting groups (except pyrethrum), depending on their own and local environmental conditions. 2. First, connect with the parents of the group members to allocate two square acres of good land to the group members, with a maximum of one acre. If the income from this land is lower than the average income in the area, it should be compensated by the social education institution. 2. All seeds and seedlings shall be borrowed by the people's education institution to the group members. 4. Village elementary school students can be used to organize this type of group (2) The Yizheng People's Education Center proposed how to reduce the difficulties in promoting sideline occupations. It was resolved to handle it according to the local financial situation. (3) How should the fund for the poor people's loan institute be raised? It was resolved that this case could be merged into the case where the funds allocated to the people's education institutions are used for the funds of credit cooperatives, adding the five characters "Poor People's Loan Institute," and no further discussion would be held. (4) Many social education undertakings are of a specialized nature, especially the livelihood education part. In order to achieve practical success, it is necessary to attract specialized talents, but it is not easy to do so due to economic difficulties and meager treatment. How should it be remedied? It was resolved to establish and handle it according to the original plan, and the association will submit a request to the Department of Education for instructions on remedial measures. Then, each case regarding other aspects was discussed: (1) It is proposed that the provincial agricultural education center in this district purchase new agricultural tools and circulate them to various counties for trial use in order to promote them. The following methods were resolved: (1) The provincial Tangshan Agricultural Education Center in this district shall raise funds to implement it. (2) The provincial agricultural center shall appoint staff to various counties to assist in trial use. (2) The association will study and decide that social and educational institutions in the counties under its jurisdiction will jointly purchase art supplies (magic illusion supplies, lantern supplies, film clips, gramophone records, and others). The method was resolved: each county will handle it on its own. (3) The social education institutions in the counties under this research association may exchange, visit, and criticize each other to promote the development of undertakings. It was resolved to pass the proposal. (4) The social education institutions in the counties under this research association will be subject to random selection of staff by the provincial center at any time to go to the provincial center for practice or to organize a visiting group to visit various places to learn from each other and improve undertakings day by day. Passed. (5) In this year's standard work, there are regulations that require each social education institution to promote new agricultural tools. What is the content of this new agricultural tool? Please determine the case. It was resolved to request the Tangshan Agricultural Education Center to investigate and study and then notify the counties to promote it. (6) Hold a livelihood exhibition to tour the counties. It was resolved to request the Tangshan Agricultural Education Center to prepare and carry it out. (7) Please ask the Provincial Education Center to send staff to the counties in this district to assist in promoting livelihood education. Passed. (8) The Provincial People's Education Center proposed dividing districts to implement compulsory education. It was resolved to submit the original proposal of twelve items to the Department of Education to order the counties to try it out in accordance with their discretion. Then, each case regarding administration was discussed: (1) The Jurong People's Education Center proposed that social education institutions in various counties should organize research branches or sub-branches under the system of this association so that they can regularly gather to study various practical social education problems and encourage each other to promote them. It was resolved that this association will submit a request to the Department of Education to notify and implement it. (2) Jiangpu proposed to request the Department of Education to notify all departments to issue social education funds to various counties on a monthly basis to facilitate the progress of undertakings. Passed. (3)</p>
<p>To realize the minimum standard work, the funds for social education institutions in various counties should be unified and averaged. It was resolved to submit a request to the Department of Education to notify the counties to handle it, and explain two points when submitting it to the Department of Education: (1) People's education centers and agricultural education centers should be equally valued. (2) A separate allocation must be made for all education centers that also run libraries and sports fields. (4) Jurong proposed whether social education institutions in various counties can set up quotas for interns to recruit junior high school graduates or above, and provide them with appropriate training to achieve the dual benefits of cultivating talents and assisting in social education. It was resolved to submit a request to the Department of Education to stipulate the methods. 5. The Tangshan Agricultural Education Center proposed to request the Department of Education to issue an order to various counties to establish agricultural and forestry supplementary schools to cultivate out-of-school youths in rural areas. Passed. (6) Jiangpu proposed to request the Department of Education to set up short-term handicraft training centers so that social education institutions in various counties can send staff to study. It was resolved to amend it to "Submit a request to the Department of Education to set up agricultural product manufacturing handicraft training centers so that social education institutions in various counties can send staff to study." Passed. (7) Submit a request to the Department of Education to promulgate compulsory literacy methods for the masses to facilitate popularization. It was resolved to handle it in the compulsory education plan that had been previously discussed. Then, each case regarding association affairs was discussed: (1) The Provincial Beijing Center proposed to draw up a draft of the organizational charter of the association and request review. Passed (2) The Provincial Beijing Center drew up a draft of the association's communication research methods and requested review. Passed. (3) Please determine the location and date of the next congress convening agency. It was resolved to hold the second congress in Tangshan in mid-October and invite the provincial Tangshan Agricultural Education Center to convene it. (4) Please determine the central research question for the next congress. It was resolved that the next congress would focus on livelihood education as the central research question (5) What kind of activities should the next congress hold? Please decide publicly. It was resolved that the next congress will hold lectures and exhibitions related to livelihood education. (6) The Social Education Research Association in the Fourth District launched the organization of the Jiangsu Social Education Research Association and intended to send a brief introduction to solicit consent. How should it be handled publicly? It was resolved to accept the principle. Then, temporary motions were discussed: (1) The Tangshan Agricultural Education Center proposed to organize the Cooperative Undertakings Promotion Committee in this district. It was resolved that one person will be recommended by the Provincial Social Education Institution and one person will be recommended by each county, and a number of honorary members will be invited to organize it. The person from each county will be designated by the Education Bureau, and the honorary members will be invited by the Provincial Social Education Institution. The discussion concluded at 5:00 PM. All proposals had been completed, so it was decided to spend another hour discussing the central research question that had not been completed yesterday, focusing only on discussing people's schools, and leaving livelihood education for the next congress to research. The other questions were limited by time, and the Provincial Social Education Institution will study them through communication in the future. The research on people's schools will still use the methods drafted by the Provincial People's Education Center as a blueprint, and the written opinions proposed by the counties will be incorporated. Generally, the methods have been decided. In the evening, Chen Jianxiao came to the meeting to give a lecture and show educational films, and it ended late at night.</p>
<p>Correction: Yesterday's newspaper published a section that combined the case that social education institution staff should closely contact local agencies and people in order to promote social education undertakings with the case on how to enable the people to receive a strong influence of civic education. This was because the association's review report did not correct the numbering of the cases in the proposal (there were two twelfth cases), which caused the reporter to miswrite. The correction is as follows: "Determine the ways in which social education institutions in various counties contact public service or autonomous institutions, and that staff of social education institutions should closely contact local institutions and people in order to promote social education undertakings. The previous case was merged into the previous case and resolved. The association will submit a request to the Department of Education to notify the county governments to instruct the agencies under their jurisdiction to assist in the process."</p>

However, a commemorative ceremony will be held at the school at 8:00 AM tomorrow, and the afternoon will be a holiday. It is reported that the school also published a commemorative publication of Zhaozhong yesterday, which was distributed to all sectors. The publication is rich in content and the materials are of great value.</p>

<p>The International Race Walking Competition will be held next Sunday. The Chinese Race Walking Association, at the urging of various circles, decided to continue to participate in the team competition. A final practice of fifteen miles and two hundred and sixty-three yards was held yesterday, with very good results. However, the representatives of the Chinese team participating in this competition are all newcomers. After discussion by the committee of the association yesterday, Zhou Ruquan, Lv Chongyi, Lv Wenxia, and Zhang Zaojiu were selected as representatives, and Cai Zhengyi and Xu Aichen were selected as alternates. Although Zhou Ruquan was a representative in the previous competition, he stopped due to illness last year, and this year he was able to be selected as a newcomer. Cai Zhengyi won the championship in the thirteen-mile open race, but in both practices, he did not complete the full distance due to a foot injury and could only be selected as an alternate. As for Ge Jinwen, the representative of the previous competition, he could not continue to be selected this time so that he and Zhou Yuyu and others could specialize in practicing the 50,000-meter race walking. The results of the five people are recorded below: 1. Zhou Ruquan 2 hours 14 minutes</p>
<p>2. Lv Chongyi 2 hours 15 minutes 15 seconds</p>

<p>The Donghua football team inexplicably lost 1-2 to French Business yesterday, and from then on, French Business's hopes for the Group A championship became higher, and Donghua couldn't even think about it. Judging from the situation of the two teams yesterday, French Business's center forward and famous player Parker was unable to play due to a two-week suspension, and the offensive was greatly reduced. The strong defender Todd did not appear, and the defense line was not very solid. Donghua's lineup was complete and the strength was quite average. After the formation, Donghua had a great advantage and thought it could win, but it turned out to be the opposite. The competition interest was not strong, but the spectators were very enthusiastic. The two stands of the Yiyuan were extremely crowded, about 10,000 people. The baseball game between Jinan and Western Business had few spectators, and the game was ordinary. As a result, Jinan won 2-1. The situation of the Group A teams is as follows:</p>

<h3 id="e211">Donghua 丨Losing 1-2 is a Pity; Although French Business is Terrible, Donghua Does Not Retreat <a href="#e211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<h3 id="e212">The Strengths of the Two Teams Are Equal <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>The French Business forwards were quite slow. Every time it came to a critical juncture, not only could they not be motivated, but they hesitated to move forward, and their vigor suddenly decreased. Donghua charged into battle like a broken bamboo. However, the abnormal result is nothing short of a miracle. It is a matter of luck and misfortune. In terms of defense, Donghua's Li Ning, Guan Xun'an, were stable and experienced, and well-known. In addition, Feng Yunyou guarded the center, with the solidity of Yu Tang. The goalkeeper, Lu Zhong'en, cannot be said to be bad. The forwards Chen Hongguang and Wan Xianghua worked the hardest. Li Yichen was consistent, and Chen Yutian was slightly inferior. The two forwards, Jia Youliang and Tu Kaiyuan Wu Youliang, were loyal to their duties. The formation was extremely compact. The French Business midfielders Remy Di and defender Marseille were the two greatest contributors. They were like walking on thin ice. In dangerous times, the two arrived and immediately relieved the danger. In terms of strength, it is difficult to distinguish between the two teams. However, after Parker and Todd play in the future, today's French Business will be different.</p>
<h3 id="e213">Everyone Has Dangers and Live Peacefully <a href="#e213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>French Business kicked off and their footwork was quite unfamiliar. Donghua often harassed the enemy camp and the offensive was quite strong. Wan Xianghua fired a cannon on the border, and Jia Youliang jumped forward to respond. Seeing the ball land, he immediately shot with extremely hard feet. Unfortunately, it went diagonally out. Li Yichen sent troops in the middle, breaking through two gaps in a row and shooting into a wild ball. After French Business was terrified, they worked hard to cheer up and the situation gradually became tense. French Business had a chance to take a free kick in the enemy's area, and took the opportunity to attack. Jimmy Huater started an uprising on the border and carried the ball deep. At a considerable point, he attacked the goal at an oblique angle. The ball flew to the right corner of the goal. From a distance, it was thought that it had entered, but it hit the wooden post and bounced out. Donghua then sent troops again, short passing and approaching. Chen Hongguang was blocked by Remy Di, and the halfway was defeated. The French Business forwards' footwork was slow, advanced and then exited, but Donghua was also not in good shape. After several back and forth, Donghua was penalized for a free kick in front of the goal. Remy Di shot fiercely, but it bounced back from the crossbar. If the ball's momentum was slightly lower, the goal would be in danger.</p>
<h3 id="e214">Donghua Lost After a Corner Kick <a href="#e214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>Back and forth, each with dangers. Both sides made no achievements due to inaccurate footwork. The defense was solid, and each had a good performance. Li Yichen was unwilling to be outdone, eager to try, and fought alone. He rushed out of three passes, just waiting to draw an arrow and launch it. Fulu Shou descended from the sky like a flying general, making a last-ditch effort and colliding with Yichen, falling to the ground together. Niegelov took a step and kicked the ball out, turning danger into safety. French Business safely overcame the difficulties. After the storm, they regained their strength and sent a punitive expedition to disrupt Donghua's rear. Jimmy Huater forced a corner kick and sent a good one. Lu Chuen was waiting to catch the ball, but he was prevented by Kelaituo from acting. Bao Shatuo took the opportunity to rush into the goal, and the record was opened. The viewers were dumbfounded. Russia: Russia has officially decided to participate, but the list has not yet been announced.</p>

<p>Donghua seemed not to care at all, and its morale did not weaken. It made every effort to make up for the loss and tried to counterattack. Wan Xianghua was careful not to be small, and repeatedly harassed the border, making French Business uneasy for a moment. Marseille did not dare to slack off, blocking one after another, struggling with each other, and holding on for a long time. The forwards on both sides were weak and often revealed flaws. When it came to 43 minutes, in a peaceful situation, Li Yichen managed to break through the enemy's goal, creating a tie. He was pleasantly surprised. The ball was kicked in by Yichen when Niegelov's head was not out. The viewers all praised in unison. The first half ended in a 1-1 draw.</p>
<h3 id="e217">Working Hard In Vain <a href="#e217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>The second battle began and the situation was quite balanced. Donghua's offensive was quite strong, but unfortunately there was no chance to attack, working hard in vain. Once, Li Yichen attacked the goal under the door, and he missed the rare opportunity because he was too hasty. Chen Hongguang was ambitious, making the enemy fearful, but he worked hard in vain, and there was nothing he could do. Xiao Wan sent a wonderful corner kick, and Chen Hongguang hit it with his head. It was less than six yards from the goal, but it flew out of the goal again, which was extremely unfortunate. Li Yichen then advanced from the middle, with the rest of the team cooperating beside him, surrounding the enemy's goal and attacking from all sides, but he could not find the door to enter. In the midst of the melee, Li Yichen accidentally injured his opponent Pan Niger and was warned by the referee. Before long, Donghua lost again.</p>
<h3 id="e218">Unable to Rescue, the Goal Lost Again <a href="#e218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>Kelaituo wandered in front of Donghua's goal, intending to act at the right time and make an inside-outside move. Li Ning saw that his actions were not good and monitored his side. Chen Yutian really showed great ambition and disturbed the border with Jia Youliang. A spark of fire almost became a prairie fire. Chen Yutian forced a corner kick. Donghua planned to send troops and build a miracle, but he was kicked out by Marseille and sent directly to the front. Kelaituo received it and rushed straight forward. Tu Kaiyuan and Feng Yunyou saw that the defense was empty and the situation was not good, but they could not withdraw their troops. Kelaituo then attacked with Bao Shatuo, with Li Ning Guan Xun'an wanting to block but unable to stop them. Bao Shatuo lifted a kick and hit the bullseye. French Business took the lead with 2-1. There was still a quarter of an hour left at this time. Donghua continued to work hard and intended to counterattack, but the opponent stepped up their guard and prevented Donghua from advancing. Although they burned their boats, they could not take advantage of it and returned in defeat.</p>

<p>Only two games were played in the Western Federation Group A football league yesterday. One was French Business vs. Donghua at Yiyuan, and the other was Jinan vs. Western Business at the baseball field. Everyone went to Yiyuan to watch Donghua, so there were few spectators at the baseball field, only over a thousand. The young heroes of Jinan worked hard and showed the heroic spirit of youth. Their ball seemed not to be valued by fans, but they first defeated the Western capture team, then defeated Lakes, and then tied with the Viersi team in the Group A competition, maintaining their male status. Yesterday, they fought the backward Western Business team, and they were sure to win again. As a result, they won 2-1. In the Group A standings, they were raised to another level and ranked third alongside the Western capture team.</p>
<h3 id="e223">One Gain and One Loss Balanced the Situation <a href="#e223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>After the bell rang three times, the drawing was completed. Jinan took the lead, and Wang Nanzhen spied along the border and sent a high ball to the front of the Western Business goal. The little monkey Xu Yahui moved forward to respond and was tripped over by the enemy general, unjustly losing the opportunity. Western Business attacked once in vain. Jinan attacked the enemy's goal again. A ball flew from the left and shot towards the enemy's goal. The high-nosed goalkeeper, Goudkin, had grease on the soles of his feet and slipped to the ground. The ball leaked into the goal, and Jinan opened the record. Western Business was not willing to be outdone and immediately fought back. Wu Lai advanced in the middle, and Hartley cooperated from the side. At a considerable position, Hartley drew his bow and shot into the goal, making the score 1-1.</p>
<h3 id="e224">Twelve-Yard Ball Passed Safely <a href="#e224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>At this time, Western Business's momentum was quite strong and often disturbed Jinan's camp. Once, Xu Heng ran out to save, preventing the enemy general from taking the lead and firing at the empty goal. Chen Zhenxiang saw that the situation was not good and acted as the goalkeeper. He caught the ball and was penalized for a twelve-yard ball. This was really a matter of quick wit and resourcefulness, otherwise, the city gate would have been lost again. There was still a glimmer of hope for the twelve-yard ball. Sure enough, Hartley aimed and shot, kicking it too cleverly. The ball bounced off the goalpost, turning danger into safety. It was an unexpected blessing for Jinan. Although Western Business's ambition did not die and continued to work hard, Xu Heng, with his quick hands and eyes, saved them one by one. The first half ended in a 1-1 draw.</p>
<h3 id="e225">Yahui's Kick Determined the Overall Situation <a href="#e225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>At the beginning of the second half, Jinan's momentum was quite strong. Jinan sentries were often lurking in front of the Western Business goal, taking the opportunity to launch an uprising. However, Bochiss and Stock of Western Business were veterans who had been on the battlefield for a long time. In addition, Faping was also a brave general, and his escort was effective, so there was no chance to take advantage of it. Each side went back and forth, making no achievements. There was a tendency for the game to end in a draw. The wind and waves rose and fell from time to time, and the situation gradually relaxed. Unexpectedly, at 40 minutes, Jinan made a comeback. Zhou Shaowen passed the ball to the little monkey Xu Yahui. Xu stepped forward, dodged to the side, pulled up a kick, and succeeded. The situation of 2-1 was thus determined. Although Western Business still struggled, hoping for a draw, they were powerless and had to retreat in defeat.</p>

<p>The cross-country race route starts from the front of Fudan University, takes Xiangyin Road, East Sports Association Road, West Sports Association Road, and returns to the original location in front of Fudan University. The entire journey is four and a half miles, equivalent to more than seven thousand meters, which is still less than ten thousand meters. Therefore, it is more than enough for the generals to run it. They returned in a moment. A total of one hundred and eleven traitors were named at the starting point, and ninety-three people returned. Among them, Jin Zhongkang and Wang Zhengling attracted the most attention. As expected, they occupied the first and second places. At the start, Jin took the lead, followed by Wang. After that, from beginning to end, Jin occupied the first place, leading. There were four people in the same group as Jin: Zhengling, Lan Shijie, and Chen Xingpei. Feihua Tianxia was thus divided among these four gentlemen. Arriving at the finish line, Wang Zhengling was about fifty meters behind Jin Zhongkang, and Lan was more than ten meters behind Wang, followed by Chen Xingpei. After the race, awards were given at Fudan, and the grand event dispersed.</p>

<p>The first round of this Public Exhibition Cup International Handball Tournament ended last week. The players of the Chinese team are talented and strong. After a long period of preparation and practice, they were able to win a big victory against the Western team by a score of ten to five, which is very gratifying. However, who will win the championship in this competition can only be determined after the victory or defeat of the second round. Therefore, this week's competition is extremely important. The Western team will definitely try their best to recover their losses. It is said that the team will change its lineup and add new strength to prepare for the decisive battle. However, our Chinese team is in high spirits and will definitely not relax easily. It is expected that in this round, the Chinese team will have even better results to wash away the previous shame and win the final victory.</p>

<p>The time is the new twelfth month, the festival is near the depths of winter, the sun is warm and the wind is gentle, and the warriors are rising up. The Huadong News Agency reporter football team assembled its troops yesterday morning, mighty and grand, and went to Daxilu to play against the Guanghua faculty and staff. It was found that most of the Guanghua team were veterans from the glorious past. The Huadong News Agency reporters had long held the great ambition to lose, and worked hard. In the first half, guns and knives clashed, killing until the flowers fell and the water flowed. The locomotive showed mercy under the knife, and was not extremely fierce. Lao Xie Rong Qizhao and Jiang Jingnan also had the style of etiquette for the country, so in the first half, you were a duck egg and I continued the soup. The afternoon started, and the melee was on time. The Huadong News Agency dared to break into the tiger's den, and a swarm of bees besieged Guanghua's gate. Shi Bingshou received secret subsidies in the chaos and scored a goal first, thus causing a terrible disaster. Jiang Jingnan immediately pulled back a stronghold, Chen Guangyao added fuel to the fire, Dong Xiaobei fired from across the mountain, and the ground bloomed. Lu Xiangqian put on his glasses and kept transporting shells in the back defense. Chen Guangyao and Leng Xueqiao were happy to be in pairs. Jiang Jingnan refused to be outdone and headed in another goal, making it six to one. The whistle blew for rest. The veterans and young players of both sides entered the reception room, treating each other with courtesy after the battle, feasting on oranges and bananas, and dispersing in joy.</p>

<p>— Xie Yunshou</p>
<p>Nowadays, it is common to see lawsuits between patients and doctors in newspapers. The court's judgments often result in non-prosecution, which proves that the doctor did not make a mistake. If there was no mistake, why did it lead to a lawsuit? I think that apart from "genuine mistakes," the remaining reasons for lawsuits are nothing more than two: one is a dispute over emotions, and the other is dissatisfaction with medical skills. The so-called dispute over emotions is a separate issue and not related to this article. What we want to discuss now is the patient's dissatisfaction with medical skills.</p>
<p>Ordinary patients, when they get sick and seek a doctor, believe that the doctor always has a solution. They even superstitiously believe that a certain disease is born with a certain medicine, which is the so-called "every disease has a medicine, and no ghost can escape death." Therefore, when they first seek treatment, they praise the doctor to the extreme. But when they die from the disease, their relatives and friends will definitely have a lot to say, either that the medicine was bad or that the surgery was bad. This is really because people overvalue medical skills. Because they overvalue it, when they encounter a disease that cannot be cured, they develop a sense of dissatisfaction with medical skills. People whose emotions are easily impulsive will make a scene that leads to a lawsuit.</p>
<p>What is considered satisfactory medical skill? I think it is difficult for anyone to make a definite statement. Now I will first write down the doctor's abilities below, and then discuss what is considered satisfactory medical skills.</p>
<p>(1) The doctor can recognize the disease. Based on their knowledge, experience, and the help of medical equipment, doctors can recognize diseases. For example, in the same case of fever, the doctor can know that A's fever is pneumonia, and B's fever is malaria. In the same case of abdominal pain, the doctor can know that A's abdominal pain is appendicitis, and B's abdominal pain is ordinary enteritis.</p>
<p>(2) The doctor can treat the disease. After recognizing the disease, the doctor can use medicines and surgery to treat the disease. For example, diphtheria is treated with diphtheria antitoxin, syphilis is treated with Salvarsan, and appendicitis is treated with surgery to completely cure the disease and restore the patient to health.</p>
<p>(3) The doctor can alleviate the patient's suffering. There are many diseases that are beyond the reach of current medical capabilities, such as severe pulmonary tuberculosis and metastatic cancers. Although doctors cannot completely cure the original disease, they can find ways to alleviate the patient's suffering. In addition, using prosthetic legs and arms to replace real legs and arms, and using artificial eyes to decorate the appearance are all methods of doing the best one can in a difficult situation.</p>
<p>(4) The doctor can prevent diseases. Doctors have the knowledge and ability to prevent diseases. For example, they know how to prevent smallpox by vaccinating, and how to prevent cholera by administering cholera vaccines. They know how infectious diseases are transmitted, and tell everyone how to pay attention. They know that scarlet fever can be followed by kidney inflammation, and that typhoid fever can be followed by intestinal bleeding and intestinal perforation. When blood pressure is too high, stroke should be prevented. The doctor not only tells the patient to pay attention in advance, but also finds ways to prevent it.</p>
<p>(5) The doctor can determine the prognosis. For example, a disease may have a very dangerous appearance, and another disease may have a very peaceful appearance. The doctor can determine that although the first disease is dangerous, there is no need to worry, while the second disease, although peaceful, is worrying. Also, for metastatic cancers and appendicitis that has become diffuse peritonitis, the doctor can know in advance that the prognosis is poor.</p>
<p>Are the above enough to be considered satisfactory medical skills? Even I dare not answer yes. Moreover, what doctors can do is often affected by the myriad changes in personnel, the different environments, the severity of the disease's virulence, the patient's resistance, the presence or absence of specific constitutions, and the occurrence of unexpected events. The results of disease treatment are not necessarily constant. Therefore, even if preventive work is done, the disease still occurs. A mild cold can suddenly turn into pneumonia, typhoid fever can suddenly lead to intestinal perforation, the use of quinine can lead to blackwater fever, and the use of serum can lead to serum sickness. Death can occur from general anesthesia and death can occur from injections of 606. Even famous surgical masters have patients who die from surgery. From the patient's point of view, this is poor medical skill, but in medical terms, it is called surgical misfortune or an occasional complication, which is something that human power cannot recover. In ancient times, there was a famous Roman doctor named Galen. He had a saying, which I will now introduce below:</p>
<p>"The reason why diseases are cured is not by the hand of the doctor, but by the power of natural spirit (Spritus Natuz ralis, Preurna Pbysikon). The doctor is only helping nature to remove the harmful conditions to the disease."</p>
<p>Now that we know the doctor's abilities as described above, and have read Galen's remarks, we can know that it is difficult to have satisfactory medical skills in the world. Therefore, as long as the doctor is not wrong from the standpoint of medical theory, he can be free of conscience.</p>
<h3 id="e236">The Crisis of Lung Disease in China and the Urgent Plan for Today (Part 1) <a href="#e236" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c236" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">236</a></h3>
<p>— Ding Huikang</p>
<p>Considering the most prevalent diseases in our society, the spread of lung disease is undoubtedly one of the most serious problems. However, in reality, lung disease is not necessarily an incurable disease, but a curable disease. The reasons why it is rampant and cannot be contained are approximately several:</p>
<p>(1) The Chinese people lack basic health knowledge. There is a risk of infection anytime, anywhere.</p>
<p>(2) The Chinese people lack basic medical knowledge. When the initial symptoms of the disease are very mild, they are often ignored, and the treatment method is unknown, so most patients lose the period when treatment should be given.</p>
<p>(3) Excessive faith in doctors. Because the Chinese people lack proper concepts, they procrastinate when they get sick, and often cannot solve the problem thoroughly. Once they invite a doctor to examine them, they regard it as having done everything they can and ignore all other more important recuperation methods.</p>
<p>(4) Belief in the omnipotence of medicine. To this day, it has been recognized by the medical community worldwide that "there is no specific medicine for lung disease," but most patients are smart and think that lung disease is a chronic disease and only needs to be treated with medicine. Therefore, if taking medicine A is ineffective, they switch to medicine B. If that is also ineffective, they buy medicine C and take it. In this way, they repeatedly delay, and unconsciously, the disease becomes severe. Only then do they begin to recuperate, but it is too late.</p>
<p>There are many reasons for the large number of lung disease patients in China today, which, in short, are approximately as described above. However, it is not too late to mend the fold after the sheep is lost. Where is the remedy?</p>
<p>(1) The state should establish a lung disease research institute.</p>
<p>The lung disease research institute must hire domestic and foreign experts to preside over it. All methods for clarifying the cause of the disease, the implementation of public health, the execution of isolating patients, and the research of preventive vaccination and effective drugs are the main tasks. This great undertaking related to the health of the nation, given the social conditions in our country and the large number of lung disease sufferers, it would not be an exaggeration for the state to allocate tens of millions or hundreds of millions in funding annually for specialized research. Unfortunately, China's construction is lagging behind in everything. Not only is there no funding in the government, but there is also a lack of specialized talent. Even if there is, they can only start a business and make a living. Those who can diligently devote themselves to research for the benefit of the country and the people, the truly great medical scientists, are as rare as phoenix feathers in China. Therefore, the establishment of a lung disease research institute is currently an impossible reality. I have no choice but to consider the next best thing. (2) Health education should be popularized and physical fitness should be emphasized.</p>
<p>Education in our country cannot be popularized, so most people lack health and medical knowledge. For the present, public health and basic medical knowledge should be included in the curriculum of existing schools, so that everyone can understand the methods of disease prevention and the main points of treatment. Those who study today want to apply what they have learned to the world in the future. The body is the foundation of learning. How can these important knowledge related to life and health not be instilled? There is no shortage of students who are diligent and persistent, but who die of lung disease after graduation. How sad it is to let such talents be buried. Therefore, the health and education authorities should properly discuss the curriculum on health, medicine, and physical fitness. It is difficult to see any results at present, but in the future, the results will be significant. When education is popularized throughout the country, the day of successful prevention of lung disease will be inevitable. But this is only in terms of preventing lung disease. As for eradicating lung disease, it is necessary for patients to have considerable medical knowledge. What is the method? Let me try to state my humble opinion.</p>
<p>(3) Each county and district should establish more lung disease prevention research associations to popularize the knowledge of prevention and treatment to the public in simple terms, so that the healthy can know how to prevent it, and the sick can know the correct treatment method, so as not to be misled by quack doctors and fake medicines. This is the best way to save oneself and put out the fire.</p>
<p>Shanghai is the center of the medical community in our country. Only this year did Mayor Wu Tiecheng and Director Li Tingan initiate the establishment of an anti-tuberculosis association for this important issue, which is a somewhat comforting move for the people. However, how to solicit members and how the association's affairs will be conducted have not yet been reported, or perhaps it has not been established for long, and all matters are waiting to be planned and implemented.</p>
<h3 id="e237">The Origin of Pharmacognosy (Continued) <a href="#e237" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c237" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">237</a></h3>
<p>— Zhao Qiong Huang</p>
<p>In the era of Western materia medica, after Dioscorides, Galen (Galenusi 130-20 A.D.) was born and enjoyed the honor of being a famous doctor for a time. Pliny the Elder (Clinius Secundue 23-79 A.D.) and Encyclopedis were also born during that time. From the third century A.D. onwards, from Oribasius Ca 325-400 A.D. downwards, the number of well-known people gradually decreased. It gradually entered the Middle Ages. In the Dark Ages, there were almost no records of scientific value. Fortunately, after leaving the Dark Ages, the Renaissance of Greek and Roman literature and art was remembered, and talents emerged in large numbers. Among the Arabs, there were many who passed on the mantle of Dioscorides, such as Trasillus. Botanists such as Brunfeis (1498-1544), Fookes, and Tragis were called the three fathers of German botany, and Valerius Cordusi 515-1544 wrote "Historia Stilium" (1519 edition), which established its scientific foundation. Materia medica experts such as Avicenna and Serapion Ca 1110 also gathered between the 10th and 15th centuries. Scholars such as Ibn Baithar +1248 followed one after another. At that time, books on materia medica circulating on the market were selling</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>extremely well. The content and level of the materia medica books were similar to the "Shen Nong Ben Cao Jing" (502 A.D.) revised by Tao Hongjing in our country. Works that have been reprinted dozens of times, such as Macor Floridus Arald Villanova Platoariolamily, Abortus Magnus, etc., are even better than our country's materia medica books. The dictionary of medicinal plants by Mattes Plateario II (completed around 1134), "Circe Instans," was the most popular materia medica book at the time. The abridged materia medica compiled from it once swept the world. Among them, the illustrated descriptions of animals, plants, and minerals, reprinted dozens of times, are the Ortus sanitatis by an anonymous author (the first edition was probably before 1475), and its translation of Johan von Cuba Gartdor Gdeundbeit (1458 edition) and its variant, the Kreutterbuch (1533 edition), etc. Also, La Grant Herbicren francoys (1490 edition) in France and its reprinted editions. The English translation of Tho Grete Herbal (1516 edition) and its reprinted editions, etc., are truly too numerous to mention. Since then, the writing of such popular materia medica books, using the name Herbal (materia medica), has gradually become popular. Such as JGorard's The Herball and R Dodonacus 1517-1585's Cruydboeck, are examples of this. Also, the same kind of work, when written in the author's native language, is more popular. When written in Latin, it goes against the norm of materia medica books and takes on the appearance of a botany book. For example, Tragus 1498-1554's "Kreuterbuce" (year edition) and "Stirpium maxim eaorum" (1652 edition) are two such books. There is also Kniphof's medicinal materia medica before Linnaeus, the so-called Offizinel Krauterbuch (1733-34 edition), etc., and Ferdinand Mull's Das grosse illustrierto Krauterbucb (first edition in 1860), which is still popular among the people today and is constantly being reprinted. It seems that Westerners implicitly regard ancient materia medica as a folk science and preserve it. Therefore, the authority of materia medica has not been diminished by the progress of botany, and it has the wonderful effect of complementing each other and developing together with botany. Finally, it was able to brew modern pharmacognosy (Pharmakognosie) (Materia medica). Who but the botanists and materia medica experts have bestowed a splendid and complete independent science from medicine and pharmacy for thousands of years? (End)</p>
<h3 id="e238">An Overview of Meningitis (3) <a href="#e238" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c238" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">238</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Xiaolan</p>
<p>(3) Spinal Tap Method: The patient's cerebrospinal cavity contains inflammatory exudate, and if the intracranial pressure increases, it will cause various stimulating symptoms. If the lumbar puncture method initiated by Dr. Oumche is performed to extract cerebrospinal fluid, the intracranial pressure will be reduced, and the symptoms will be alleviated accordingly. The amount of fluid extracted should be determined according to the level of intracranial pressure, usually about 20 to 80 cc each time, with an appropriate reduction for children, and it should be performed daily or every other day. If the cerebrospinal fluid is turbid and mixed with pus, sterile physiological saline can be injected during the puncture for repeated washing until it becomes clear, and then serum can be injected for even more remarkable results.</p>
<p>(4) Drug Therapy: If the patient has an excessively high fever or severe pain, antipyretic analgesics such as Aspirin, Phenacetin, and Cryogenine can be taken. If there is insomnia, delirium, or manic restlessness, sedatives and hypnotics such as potassium bromide, sodium bromide, and Veronal can be taken, or antispasmodic agents such as morphine and PantoponScopolamin can be injected, or green soap enemas can be used. If there is constipation or urinary retention, enemas or urinary catheterization can be performed, and laxatives such as calomel and rhubarb can be taken concurrently, or urinary disinfectants such as Urotropin can be taken. If there is heart failure, cardiotonics such as camphor products like Hexeton and digitalis products like Digalen can be used, either by injection or internal administration. Recently, for this disease, there are also those who use systemic disinfectants, such as Electrargol and Trypaflavin, by injection, and sometimes they are effective.</p>
<p>Prevention of Meningitis</p>
<p>When this disease is prevalent, attention should be paid to hygiene, maintaining cleanliness, and ensuring that houses have good air circulation and sufficient light. Carbolic acid or quicklime water should be sprinkled frequently in ditches, toilets, and dirty places for disinfection. Those who are fond of tobacco and alcohol, catch colds, are physically and mentally overworked, or have head injuries are all prone to developing this disease and should be especially careful to prevent it. Furthermore, people with lymphatic constitutions, or those who frequently have inflammation in the nose, throat, tonsils, etc., have a predisposing factor for this disease, and should regularly use disinfectant solutions, such as potassium chlorate water and hydrogen peroxide, to rinse their mouths and gargle their throats. If you feel dizzy, have a headache, or feel unwell, you should seek medical treatment at any time and do not ignore it.</p>
<p>Isolating patients and avoiding transmission are essential for prevention. Therefore, when this disease or suspected symptoms are found, they should be immediately separated from healthy people, and visits from relatives and friends should be prohibited. The patient's room and all sundries must not be used by others unless they have been disinfected. Places where many people gather inevitably have pathogens mixed in, so they must not be frequented. The mouth and nose are the gateways for germs to enter, so masks must be worn during the epidemic period of this disease, and they should be cleaned with disinfectant solutions from time to time. If talking to someone, do not get close. Anyone who enters the patient's home or is close to the patient should be injected with meningitis vaccine or meningitis serum.</p>
<p>Injecting meningitis vaccine into the human body can produce antibodies to resist germ invasion. Each person should be injected three times, with an interval of four to five days. The injection site can be subcutaneous or intramuscular in the thigh, and the dosage should be gradually increased, with a maximum limit of one cc. Appropriate reductions should be made for children. It is forbidden for those with elevated body temperature, beriberi, heart or kidney disease, or pregnancy. When the epidemic is rampant and rapid immunity is desired, ten cc of serum can be injected subcutaneously or intramuscularly, followed by the vaccine. Because the effect of serum is faster than that of the vaccine, but it is not as long-lasting as the vaccine, it is advisable to use both. Recently, the serum vaccine used is mostly produced by the Central Epidemic Prevention Office and the Shanghai Health Laboratory. It is particularly reliable to refer to the attached instructions before use. (End)</p>
<h3 id="e239">Farewell to Western Suit <a href="#e239" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c239" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">239</a></h3>
<p>— Song Guobin</p>
<p>Oh, Western suit! We are parting ways with you! I recall wearing you for more than ten years. In the beginning, I set sail ten thousand miles, carrying my books to Europe and the West. Without you for even a day, it was difficult to interact with the people of that country. I had no choice but to befriend you and adorn myself with you. After returning to my country, due to the habit that had been formed, I did not sever ties with you. Now, realizing the errors of my past blind following and lamenting the multitude of my countrymen who wear you, I extend the meaning of severing ties in the style of Ruan Ji and imitate Han Yu's "Farewell to Poverty," enumerating your crimes and rebuking you, saying:</p>
<p>Clothing is for fitting the body. If the body is not comfortable, what is the use of clothing? In ancient times, lofty hats and broad belts, wide sleeves and loose collars may have been incompatible with hygiene, but you have completely reversed this, valuing smallness above all else. Your collar is as stiff as a yoke, and your sleeves are as narrow as shackles. Every movement of the neck and every stretch of the thigh seems to be restricted by you. Nothing is more restrictive of freedom than you. This is your first crime.</p>
<p>Wearing linen in summer and fur in winter is a constant principle. You are only suitable for spring and autumn. Wearing you in summer, sweat sticks to the back. Wearing you in winter, snot and tears flow horizontally. Moreover, among all parts of the body, the chest is the weakest. You alone do not provide adequate protection here, causing body temperature to dissipate easily and cold air to easily invade, causing those who wear you to endure severe cold for your sake and develop diseases for your sake, harming hygiene more than anything else. This is your second crime.</p>
<p>Profits flow outward, and the country's resources are not strong. Rescuing the tide depends on advocating domestic goods. Your raw materials come from foreign lands, and your value is far higher than that of Chinese clothing. Patriots, though advocating domestic goods in word, wear foreign goods for your sake. Considering just you alone, the leakage of wealth each year is no less than hundreds of millions. The country is impoverished, and the people are exhausted. You are truly a sharp blade. This is your third crime.</p>
<p>You have three crimes and not a single virtue. Those who wear you are deluded by the new trends of Europe and America, forgetting their original appearance, using convenience as an excuse, and deceiving others with false beauty, thus forming an indissoluble bond with you! You also exploit the psychology of the ignorant masses, acting as a pioneer in destroying hygiene and a tool for economic aggression. If this is tolerable, what is not tolerable? If you speak of convenience, then what is wrong with Sun Yat-sen suits made in China? If you speak of beauty, then are not the flowing robes of China always the fair sons of a turbid age? Alas, if such people were to fill their minds with admiring the foreign, how many would not dye their beards yellow and their clothing blue? I now enumerate your crimes to proclaim them to my countrymen, not daring to consider myself enlightened, but also wishing to banish you from outside China and slightly recover our rights and interests, even by a fraction.</p>

<p>(17) Galangal Galanga</p>
<p>Origin</p>
<p>This product is the rhizome of the Zingiberaceae plant Alpinia officinarum Hance, produced in the coastal provinces of Southeast China. It is collected in autumn and dried. Its original plant is a perennial herb with a round and straight stem, six to seven feet tall. The leaves are lanceolate, with short petioles, slightly fleshy. The flowers are irregular greenish-white. The fruit is a deep orange egg shape. Its seeds are called red cardamom.</p>
<p>Properties</p>
<p>This product is a cylindrical creeping rhizome with many fibrous roots. The outside is dark reddish-brown, with longitudinal wrinkles. Every five millimeters or so, there are light-colored, fire-tooth-shaped remnants of leaf sheaths. There are also many remnants of roots. The inside is reddish-brown, sometimes lighter than the outside, sometimes darker. It has a good and pungent odor and a spicy and very fragrant taste.</p>
<p>Composition</p>
<p>This product contains volatile oil. Its oil contains three kinds of crystals, namely, yellow flat crystals of Kampferid C16H12O6H2O, pale yellow prismatic crystals of Galangin, and granular crystals of Alpinin. It also contains resin, starch, and colloids.</p>
<p>Effect</p>
<p>This product is used as an aromatic stomachic. Its true ginger powder is yellowish-green and turns reddish-brown with sulfuric acid.</p>
<p>Appendix Old Sayings</p>
<p>It is pungent and hot, warms the stomach, disperses cold, promotes digestion, and relieves drunkenness. It treats cold pain in the stomach. The Yuanyang powder for treating coughs and hiccups contains galangal and licorice in equal parts, half an ounce each, and one mace of cloves, powdered. Take two mace per dose, infused in hot water.</p>
<p>(Note) The Japanese Kumatakeran is a different species of galangal. Mr. Tomitaro Makino determined its scientific name to be Alpinia Kunratake Makinoo. It is a mistake to regard it as galangal.</p>

<h3 id="e241">Rice Monopoly and the Relationship with Food Supply Chu Yu <a href="#e241" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c241" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">241</a></h3>
<p>In modern society, the economy is becoming increasingly impoverished, and the food supply is out of balance. On the one hand, producers constantly fail to cover their losses due to fluctuating prices, leading to the tragic phenomenon of famine in bumper years. On the other hand, consumers are also greatly threatened in their lives due to fluctuations in supply and demand. In addition, profiteers monopolize the market. As a result of laissez-faire competition under capitalism, the structure and function of the national economy are lost. Rice is the main food of the people, and it is clear that it is not in the best interest of the country if there is no comprehensive and appropriate plan for regulation. Recently, many countries have advocated rice control and monopoly, believing that it is a fundamental policy to conserve supply and demand, maintain prices, and relieve rural areas, and it is worthy of learning from. In addition to Japan's controlled rice, which was published in this journal at the beginning of last month, the relationship between the monopoly system and the people is described below, as a reference for those who are concerned about food supply issues.</p>
<h3 id="e242">Theory of Rice Monopoly <a href="#e242" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c242" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">242</a></h3>
<p>On what basis is the theory of rice monopoly based? Judging from today's situation, it is an urgent matter that cannot be delayed. Here, the advantages and disadvantages of the two types of monopoly are briefly described: (1) Financial monopoly: also known as income monopoly, the intention of a country's government to implement a monopoly in order to seek financial income. This type of monopoly is mostly due to a country's financial poverty. The government purchases a certain product at a low price and resells it at a special price, using the profits from the buying and selling to supplement the government's revenue. Therefore, it can also be called a profit-making monopoly. However, if rice is monopolized and bought at a low price, farmers will inevitably suffer losses. If it is sold at a high price, consumers will bear a heavier burden. Is this not contrary to the purpose of food policy? (2) Relief monopoly: also known as charitable monopoly, it is the opposite of financial monopoly, that is, the government predetermines a certain financial loss, buying at a high price and selling at a low price. This type of monopoly is limited to special periods and is similar to our country's system of ever-normal granaries and price equalization. Buying at a high price benefits farmers, and selling at a low price benefits consumers. However, this is not always the case. For example, buying when grain is cheap during the harvest season and selling when grain prices are high before the new harvest. In countries with financial difficulties, it cannot be implemented indefinitely. (3) Economic monopoly: another new type of monopoly, different from both of the above. The government does not bear any financial burden, but also does not have any financial income. It does not return to the buying price, but adds administrative costs and sells it. The rice monopoly discussed here belongs to this type of monopoly. The government calculates the production cost of rice to buy it, adds a very small amount of expenses, and sells it to consumers. Therefore, the government has no profit or loss to speak of, and both producers and consumers are happy to comply. From this, it can be seen that the purpose of rice monopoly is definitely not to sacrifice the people or increase the government's burden because of the monopoly, nor can it be to sacrifice the government and charitably relieve the people because of the monopoly. Its purpose is to distribute important national products to the entire nation in the most reasonable way, so it is a rational socio-economic function. Therefore, the exclusive right to buy and sell must belong to the state, because private operation is not only unprofitable, but also suffers great losses. (A) The rise and fall of rice prices have a great impact on the national economy. Speculators who manipulate the market disrupt prices and attempt to obtain illegal profits everywhere. Therefore, the government, considering the entire national economy, should stabilize rice prices, that is, producers and farmers can work hard to improve crops and increase harvests due to stable prices, and consumers can also have expectations for their daily staple food due to income. (B) The economic nature of rice is that although laissez-faire free competition is allowed under capitalism, it is limited to a certain degree. To maintain the regulation of production and consumption, the entire function lies in the regulation of prices, so as to expand and contract the production and consumption of commodities. If a certain commodity is abundant, the price will rise due to increased demand, and producers will mutually seek to increase production because it is profitable. As a result, the supply of products will inevitably increase, leading to a drop in prices. The production and consumption of rice are also the same. However, although the amount of rice production can be artificially increased, it often increases or decreases due to natural and accidental reasons. It is not like other industries, which can suddenly increase production. Consumers cannot reduce their food intake due to rising prices. Although the nature of rice has now changed from domestic to international, that is, even if the country has a famine year, neighboring countries can still regulate the quantity if they are in a bumper year. But domestically, it should be monopolized by the government, which can regulate its price and quantity.</p>
<h3 id="e243">Effect of Rice Monopoly <a href="#e243" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c243" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">243</a></h3>
<p>The effect of rice monopoly. There are four types: (1) Monopoly can stabilize prices. (2) The monopoly system can reduce price changes by buying at a special price and selling at a low price. (3) Monopoly can establish the farmers' economy and restore the rural economy. (4) Monopoly can ensure the national food supply. However, to what extent can the above four major effects be expected? We can examine it from a pure market perspective. As mentioned above, price fluctuations are detrimental to both producers and consumers. The production and consumption of rice are different from other commodities and cannot be regulated due to price fluctuations, so it is difficult to exert its full economic function. However, the fluctuation and stability of rice prices contain various meanings: (1) Rice prices fluctuate seasonally. Generally, the price will fall a few months after the harvest, and it will be expensive during the period before the new harvest. (2) It fluctuates due to bumper and poor harvests. Generally, the price falls in bumper years and rises in poor years. (3) It fluctuates due to the economy, that is, it differs from the economic fluctuations of a grain. However, there are also times when the harvest season is normal, but the price is low, or in a year of poor harvest, the economy is quite prosperous, and rice prices are relatively high. There are also times when there is no change during the period before the new harvest because there is still a lot of rice stored from the previous year and the harvest this year is very abundant. If a monopoly is implemented, can it stabilize prices? This is discussed in the following points: (1) Seasonal fluctuations and the monopoly system: seasonal fluctuations in rice prices are most beneficial to landlords and rice merchants. Why? Because they are the owners of rice during the period before the new harvest. On the contrary, for owner-farmers, tenant farmers, and poor farmers, because they are short of money, they have to sell rice regardless of the price drop or the prospect of rising prices in the future after the rice is harvested. Especially the poor, because they are in urgent need of funds, even sell all the rice they use for their own meals. When the period before the new harvest comes, they buy it back. The loss suffered due to the buying and selling relationship is self-evident. Therefore, implementing a monopoly can alleviate seasonal price fluctuations. (2) Bumper and poor harvest movements and the monopoly system: under the monopoly system, rice prices can be fixed. However, the basic standard for determining rice prices mainly depends on the production cost of rice. This standard production cost varies depending on the bumper or poor harvest of the year. Why? Although the area of farmland cultivated by farmers and the capital and labor invested are the same every year, the resulting harvest amount increases or decreases depending on the bumper or poor harvest of the year. If a monopoly is implemented, price fluctuations due to bumper and poor harvests can be avoided. (3) Volume fluctuations and the monopoly system: rice prices often fluctuate due to the general economic climate. In times of good economy, income increases, and in times of bad economy, income decreases. Therefore, consumers can proportionally increase or decrease their staple food rice in proportion to their income, that is, in proportion to the economic fluctuations in general. Producers and farmers can increase their capital income by increasing labor demand during periods of good economy. However, because the cost of fertilizers and other raw materials is high, rice prices have to be raised. With this production cost as the standard, rice prices will naturally fluctuate according to the economy. And general prices also fluctuate due to the economic climate. If a certain price is set under the monopoly system, the trend of fluctuation can be alleviated. Because the economy of producers and farmers is more stable than the economy of a certain economy, rice price fluctuations can fluctuate below the economy. In other words, the rice index is smaller than the general price index. Although, opponents of the monopoly believe that price stability curbs hopes above a certain level. But when we compare it with the national economy as a whole, the monopoly is still beneficial. Moreover, when it comes to the problem of relieving rural areas, the current rural areas are burdened with debt and the prices of agricultural products have plummeted, which is a major problem facing us. If a monopoly is implemented to stabilize rice prices, farmers will have a certain calculation for operating agriculture, and agriculture can be expected to develop healthily. Moreover, today's rice prices are unstable, and healthy agriculture has fallen into the hands of the most dangerous speculators, resulting in the destruction of the traditional agricultural spirit. Not only that, but also because of the monopoly, the food supply can be ensured and the quantity of supply and demand can be regulated. In recent years, natural and man-made disasters have followed one after another. If private profit-making is allowed, the impact on the entire nation is unthinkable. The government can freely regulate the surplus of bumper harvests and the lack of poor harvests by storing grain; other things such as the dumping of foreign rice can also be controlled according to the monopoly law. In short, under certain conditions, the level of prices can be freely regulated and circulated in harmony.</p>
<h3 id="e244">Methods for the Government Monopoly of Rice and Grain <a href="#e244" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c244" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">244</a></h3>
<p>The methods of a government monopoly are the most difficult issues for a monopoly business. If the arrangements are improper, not only will the intended effects not be achieved, but endless disputes will be caused. Why? Because there must be a truly meticulous plan regarding the determination of the purchase price for the cost of production, the scope of the purchase, and the allocation for sale. Now, regarding the important methods of implementation, I will elaborate as follows: (1) Determining the purchase price issue. Those who oppose the government monopoly focus on the production cost of rice for the purchase price. However, how exactly should this so-called production cost be determined? This is truly the first point that is not easy to determine. Because the production cost of rice and grain differs depending on the location, it is vastly different between Jiangsu and Zhejiang and the two Guangdong provinces, and it is quite different between Zhili and Shandong and Gansu. To rigorously investigate the actual situation in various places is truly not easy. If purchasing based on the production cost, one would have to differentiate the price according to the land. In this way, the starting point of the monopoly system would fall into a state where implementation is impossible. However, those who advocate for a government monopoly believe that it is impossible to implement it according to the actual production cost. This is because the labor capital invested by farmers and the production cost obtained from their land cannot be bought at the same price. For example, if a farming family does not pay attention to irrigation, weeding, fertilization, pests, and diseases, they will naturally not obtain the original harvest. On the other hand, diligent and hardworking farming families often obtain above-average increases in yield. If the former is purchased at a high price and the latter is purchased at a low price, contradictions will inevitably arise. Therefore, the purchase price cannot be calculated according to the actual production cost. Instead, the actual production cost should be averaged or standardized within a certain range of production areas. However, the so-called standard production cost includes a national standard production cost and a standard production cost for a province, county, or township. What is being discussed now is in terms of the national standard. At the same time, provinces and counties should be graded separately and a compromise should be reached. For example, if the national standard production cost is 100, the entire number can be divided into twelve grades. If the index numbers for each area are 95, 96, 97, and 105, then the national production cost is 25 yuan per unit, the first grade is 23 yuan and 75 cents, the fifth grade is 24 yuan and 75 cents, and the eleventh grade is 26 yuan and 25 cents. However, calculating the national standard production cost is extremely difficult and must be calculated using technical methods. In detail, first calculate the national standard production cost according to the actual amount harvested each year. Then, multiply by the index number for each grade or location to calculate the standard production cost for each location. Based on this standard, further determine the price for each level based on the grade of rice and grain in each place. In this way, it will not be far from the actual production cost. Although there will inevitably be some difference between the actual production cost and the actual purchase price, it will be beneficial to rice and grain production, and it is also what farmers hope for. Why? Because when farmers obtain an above-average harvest with ordinary diligence, the actual production cost for each individual decreases. Deducting the purchase price allows them to obtain a reward for special labor. Conversely, if they are ordinarily lazy and cannot obtain a normal harvest, the reduction in yield results in a high actual production cost. Therefore, the government monopoly can promote the development of agriculture and the diligence and effort of farmers. (2) The scope of the purchase. This is the issue of the quantity purchased. In other words, what scope of the farmer's rice and grain production should be purchased? Those who advocate for a government monopoly are divided into two views: One is the complete purchase theory, which means purchasing all the rice and grain produced by farmers. This means that the rice and grain used by the farming family itself would be treated the same as ordinary citizens, and they would have to buy it back when they need it. The other is the partial purchase theory, which means deducting the rice and grain used by the farming family itself and purchasing the remaining surplus. From the perspective of the farming family's economy, the first view sees the major cause of poverty in rural areas today as the gradual erosion of the original nature of the farming family's economy by capitalist monetary economics. The government monopoly system can prevent this abuse. However, if all the rice and grain produced by the farming family is sold off at once, and then they have to buy it back for their own use later, the farming family's economy will inevitably be entirely monetized. This greatly contradicts the policy of rural regeneration. Therefore, the second view, the partial purchase theory, advocates deducting the rice and grain used by the farming family itself, which can prevent the monetization of rural areas. However, the amount deducted for rice and grain for personal use varies from farming family to farming family, and determining the amount is extremely difficult. Therefore, there must be a predetermined statistic for the total national consumption and the amount to be consumed per person, as well as a ratio of production and supply quantities, and family budget, etc. If the predicted amount of rice and grain consumption is not completely accurate, and there is a surplus of rice and grain due to an error in prediction, then it can be used to cover consumption in the first year. If the prediction is too low, then there is no problem. (3) The timing of the purchase. Purchasing at regular intervals is most appropriate. Ideally, the farming family should sell most of the harvested rice and grain in proportion throughout the year, except for the currency needed for annual use. However, this method not only makes government monopoly affairs complicated, but also requires a lot of distribution costs. Therefore, scholars from various countries mostly advocate for purchasing in installments. For example, purchasing three times in November and December, February and March, and June and July. However, the timing of the purchase should be decided after the purchase price is determined, and it should also be after the actual amount harvested nationwide is confirmed. The announcement of the actual amount harvested is mostly at the end of January each year in various countries. On the one hand, consider the latest harvest period and the earliest harvest period nationwide. Although there are differences in prices between the two, the government monopoly agency can make overall regulations based on the situation of the previous year. In general, when implementing a government monopoly system, the price of rice and grain is mostly not affected by seasonal fluctuations, so the price can be fixed throughout the year. (4) Purchasing agency. Under today's social conditions, rice and grain inspection agencies should be established in each province and county, directly under the central government monopoly bureau. This agency specializes in the production and consumption of rice and grain within each province, the need and supply, import and export, warehousing and out-of-warehousing matters, and reports to the central government monopoly bureau. Based on the information obtained from its report, it can be used as a reference for determining prices, and it can also be used to adjust the circulation of quantities. (5) Selling price. Now that the purchase price has been legally stipulated, the determination of the selling price can be made by adding the government monopoly business expenses to the national standard distribution cost to determine the generalized production cost. However, if the annual production cost fluctuates, the state can use technical methods to alleviate it and prevent the selling price from changing due to bumper or poor harvests. Although the production of each province, such as the quality of rice and grain, transportation, and other expenses, are very different, if the actual production cost in each province has already been investigated in detail, then it will be no different from the standard price. At the same time, in consideration of social policies, the price of the higher grade rice should be increased, and the price of the lower grade rice should be reduced in order to harmonize with the living conditions of the lower class of the people. If it is deemed necessary to provide relief rice to the poor and needy, it should be sold at a particularly low price. (6) Allocation method. It is essential to adhere to the principle of self-sufficiency in each locality. However, in various parts of the country, due to inconvenient transportation, the price of rice and grain is often determined by geographical proximity. For example, in Wuxi and Changshu counties in Jiangsu, those exported to other provinces account for 60-70%. In addition to defining self-sufficiency in terms of provinces and counties, the government monopoly system must also take into account villages and towns with less rice production and adjust excessive production and insufficient consumption. Therefore, efforts should be made to save on distribution costs and use reasonable and smooth means. However, to allocate rice and grain, it is necessary to clearly investigate the production and consumption situation in each province and county across the country, as well as be familiar with the situation of foreign rice imports, so that quantities can be circulated at any time.</p>
<h3 id="e245">The Trend of the Japanese Banking Industry by Tan Bingwen <a href="#e245" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c245" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">245</a></h3>
<p>The banking industry in our country, judging from Shanghai alone, appears to be booming. New banks and branch banks are not affected by the decline of other industries. If this phenomenon persists, it will become abnormal. Scholars in our country have long had insights into whether the banking system is sound and how to improve it. Japan's industrial revolution was later than that of Europe and the United States. Its national conditions are quite similar to ours, so I will introduce the current situation and trends of its banking industry for the reference of those concerned about our country's banking industry.</p>
<p>After the end of World War, banks in various countries have shown a tendency to concentrate. There are two steps: one is the merger of small banks by large banks, and the other is the self-merger between large-scale banks, which is different from the merger of small banks before the war. This trend also exists in Japan. Since the outbreak of the financial panic in the spring of Showa 1 (1926), the trend of bank concentration in Japan has become more intense. Due to the aftermath of the Wall Street stock market turmoil, the weaker and poorly managed banks in Japan experienced difficulties in recovering loans, reduced credit, and a flight of deposits. The functions of both lending and borrowing were hindered, and business became difficult, resulting in many bankruptcies.</p>
<p>Therefore, the current banking law was promulgated on January 1 of the following year, and the banking system underwent a major change. The new law stipulates that the minimum capital amount for each bank should be one million yuan or more in principle. A special provision states that "if there is a head office or branch in a specific area (referring to Tokyo and Osaka), its capital shall not be less than two million yuan." There is also a clause that states: "(In areas with a population of less than 10,000, banks that are currently operating shall increase their capital to 500,000 yuan or more within five years after the implementation of this law)." With the implementation of the new regulations, the process of mergers and acquisitions of small and medium-sized banks has become increasingly rapid. A glimpse of the situation can be seen in the report of the Ministry of Finance at the end of Showa 7 (1932), when the so-called five-year preparation period was about to expire. According to the report, before the implementation of the new banking law, the total number of ordinary banks was 1283, and 617 did not meet the statutory capital requirements, accounting for about half. Among them, 50 continued to operate after increasing their capital, while the rest were either merged or dissolved, and all disappeared within five years. During the same period, hundreds of so-called qualified banks were merged. As of January 10 of this year, there were only 538 banks in existence.</p>
<p>During this great elimination movement, the capital of ordinary banks also showed a very significant change. At the end of Showa 2 (1927), the total capital of 1282 such banks was 2.364 billion yuan, with an average amount of 1.843 million yuan per bank. As of January 10 of this year, the total capital of 538 banks was 1.91 billion yuan (the reasons for the reduction in the capital of ordinary banks are described below), with an average of 3.556 million yuan per bank. In other words, the number of banks decreased by 60% in five years, while the average capital per bank increased by 90%.</p>
<p>The main business of banks can be summarized into two aspects: receiving credit and granting credit. Receiving credit, also known as passive business, is mainly based on deposits. Granting credit, or active business, is mainly based on lending and investment. Therefore, we can also examine the progress of the Japanese banking industry from these two aspects. First, let's study the aspect of receiving credit, and list the deposit amounts of various Japanese banks at the end of Showa 1 (1926) before the financial panic and at the end of June of this year, as follows. (Unit: million Japanese yen)</p>
<p>Type End of Showa 1 End of June this year Remarks</p>
<p>Special banks 1,545 1,261 Decrease of 285</p>
<p>Ordinary banks 9,174 8,618 Decrease of 556</p>
<p>Savings banks 1,067 1,766 Increase of 699</p>
<p>Trust companies 5,778 6,424 Increase of 646</p>
<p>Postal Savings Bureau 423 1,262 Increase of 825</p>
<p>Others 1,199 2,756 Increase of 1,557</p>
<p>In the table above, the "special banks" item is set aside because its deposits are mostly government funds. However, the changes between other types of banks are very obvious: ordinary banks have decreased, while savings banks have greatly increased. The increase in trust companies and postal savings is particularly astonishing. Although some of this is due to the natural increase resulting from the development of the Japanese national economy, there is no doubt that a significant amount of funds has fled from ordinary banks to savings banks, trust companies, and postal savings.</p>
<p>The rapid progress of the trust business is particularly noteworthy. Japanese trust companies were established at the end of Taisho 12 (1923). As of the end of June of this year, about 11 years had passed, and the capital had reached 6,414,000,000 yen. According to the Japanese Ministry of Communications' observation, the increase in postal savings mainly came from current deposits in banks (mainly ordinary banks), reaching 700-800 million yen. The increase in savings bank deposits is because these banks are affiliated with relatively large banks and have strong capital systems, so their credit is quite solid, and they have been able to erode the deposits of ordinary banks.</p>
<p>The reduction in special bank deposits is due to the expansion of the Japanese government's finances. The sharp decline in ordinary bank deposits, in addition to the competition from other types of banks mentioned above, the prosperity of speculative businesses is an important factor. In this situation, people believe that bank interest rates are too low and invest in public bonds, corporate bonds, real estate stocks, and other transactions. The amount of funds that have fled as a result must be no less than the amount that has fled to savings banks and other banks.</p>
<p>Every organization has its economic background. The changes in Japanese banks are a reflection of its national economy. For example, the development of the trust business is the result of the increase in large deposits from the domestic asset class. As for the inflow of funds into postal savings and savings banks, it is mostly small deposits from the public. In the past, because special banks were small in scale or had not yet been established, both large and small deposits were deposited in ordinary banks. However, as the economic situation progresses, banks that meet new needs will inevitably emerge, so funds will flow from old organizations to their appropriate places. This is similar to the fact that the class boundaries are not clear in countries where the industry is underdeveloped. However, as the industry becomes more developed, the class divisions become more distant. Therefore, we can predict that if the Japanese economy does not collapse, this phenomenon of fund differentiation will tend to be more intense in the future.</p>
<p>In the situation described above, not only do ordinary banks experience changes in deposits due to external relations, but changes also occur among ordinary banks themselves. That is, deposits are shifting from banks with smaller capital to banks with stronger capital. Large-scale ordinary banks mostly have head offices in large cities and branches throughout the country, making it easier to carry out their lending, investment, deposit, and other businesses.</p>
<p>Next, let's look at the bank's credit granting business. There are also significant changes. Whether in lending or investment, large transactions are becoming increasingly popular. This trend is particularly evident in the business of large banks. Although the number of small transactions is also increasing, the average amount per transaction is decreasing. These two trends are closely related to the changes and concentration of funds mentioned above. However, the decisive factor is the so-called large-scale demand for funds. The reasons for this large-scale demand are the progress and control of the business world, as well as the increase in public bonds due to financial expansion.</p>
<p>It is beneficial for the banking industry to use large-scale income to finance large-scale businesses. This not only saves various cumbersome procedures and operating expenses, but also because large-scale loans or investments have greater certainty (it is easier to investigate the object of financing and the content of its business). Therefore, these large banks with excess funds should use them for large transactions, whether from a theoretical or practical point of view. As for small and medium-sized banks, because their capital is weak, they cannot invest in large amounts to compete with large banks, so they have to work hard on a wide range of small transactions. However, the results are not satisfactory: the number of transactions increases, but the content decreases. This differentiation of bank credit granting business will inevitably cause the differentiation of deposits at the same time.</p>
<p>The degree of the world economic panic is deepening, the trend of financial expansion in various countries is becoming more intense, and the adoption of so-called cartel trust monopoly businesses and control policies is becoming more widespread. Both public and private businesses need large amounts of money. As a result, large banks give full play to their abilities, while small and medium-sized banks are in a position where they cannot cope. Small banks have to actively attempt mergers (Absorption) in order to find a way out. Even large banks are competing for large and high-quality loans and investments, and resorting to the law of survival of the fittest, implementing joint-stock personnel mergers.</p>
<p>Bank mergers in Europe and the United States have been absolutely prevalent for half a century. As for mergers or combinations (Amalgamation) between large banks, they have only become popular since the great war. (Please refer to "On Bank Mergers" in Bank Weekly, Volume 17, Issue 21.) The progress in Japan is no different. The difference is that the banking system of a country must have a special economic foundation. For example, the industrial revolution in the United Kingdom occurred the earliest, so the evolution (merger process) of the banking system was also the earliest. Therefore, by 1925, the capital of the "Big Five Banks" accounted for about 70% of the national bank capital. The degree of bank merger in Japan is far inferior (see the table on the left), because the majority of small and medium-sized industries and agriculture in Japan still occupy a relatively important position. However, Japan's journey towards bank concentration is also very rapid. As mentioned above, at the end of Showa 1 (1926), there were 1283 banks in Japan. By the beginning of this year, the number had decreased to 538. The recent merger (joint-stock) of the 34th, Yamaguchi, and Konoike banks has broken the record of the Japanese banking industry. The following is a list of the national bank survey by the Ministry of Finance at the end of January this year.</p>
<p>Bank type Number of banks Total capital amount (unit: thousand yuan)</p>
<p>Below 1 million yuan 147 79,78</p>
<p>Below 2 million yuan 214 238,857</p>
<p>Below 5 million yuan 94 249,535</p>
<p>Below 10 million yuan 38 241,967</p>
<p>Below 30 million yuan 37 486,879</p>
<p>Below 50 million yuan 1 33,988</p>
<p>Above 50 million yuan 7 579,700</p>
<p>Total 538 1,910,461</p>
<p>The fourteen large banks with capital of 50 million yuan or more mentioned on the right have recently merged with Yamaguchi, so it has actually become a bank. Although the remaining capital only accounts for 30% of the total capital of ordinary banks, if the basis is 10 million yuan, there are still 493 small and medium-sized banks below that, accounting for more than 90% of the number of ordinary banks. Since the capital of these banks is so weak, it is obvious that they are not suitable for the needs of the new environment. Now that the United States and Russia have resumed diplomatic relations, the international situation is quite unfavorable to Japan. The Japanese government is bound to expand its finances again to expand its military preparations as a precaution. The internal control business in Japan is also expanding more and more. All in all, there is a need for large amounts of money. In other words, the investment places for those with strong financial resources in the Japanese financial world are expanding more and more, while those with weak financial resources are feeling more and more difficult. In this situation, it can be predicted that it will follow in the footsteps of the United Kingdom.</p>

<h3 id="e248">Deposit Interest Rate Negotiations Have Been Announced <a href="#e248" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c248" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">248</a></h3>
<p>The deposit interest rate negotiations have always been at 2 yuan per month due to the low call loan rate. Last month, it exceeded the prescribed market rate because it increased in the second half of the month. The daily money industry meeting discussed the deposit interest rate, which was 2 yuan and 50 cents with a 95% discount. The interest due was still calculated at the base rate of 4 yuan and 50 cents. As such, the highest interest due was 10 yuan and 05 cents.</p>
<h3 id="e249">Concerning the Highly Dreadful Bond Market of Last Week: Conflicting Information, Rampant Rumors, Overall Drops Ranging from One or Two Yuan to Three or Five Yuan <a href="#e249" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c249" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">249</a></h3>
<p>Last week, from November 27th to December 2nd, the Chinese Securities Exchange, since the Fujian Incident, had already moved into its second act. Furthermore, due to the November futures settlement, market prices experienced even greater fluctuations. One wave after another, news changed by the hour, and rumors abounded. Sometimes the situation in Fujian and Zhejiang was described as perilous, other times Guangdong and Fujian were said to have reached an understanding. There were calls to welcome Hu Hanmin, then to persuade Cai Tingkai. Guangdong's attitude shifted, sometimes appearing obedient to the central government, sometimes allied with Fujian, and sometimes remaining an observer. With war seemingly imminent, mediation efforts continued ceaselessly. The situation was bizarre and bewildering, yet these were merely peripheral issues, not the crux of the matter. The bond market fluctuated wildly, demonstrating the full extent of its volatility. The situation grew increasingly chaotic. Major players maintained control, their actions seemingly based on genuine holdings rather than speculative manipulations to create an illusion of prosperity. On Monday, with the November futures having concluded, the market focused solely on December. The Fujian Incident news subsided, and both buyers and sellers adopted a wait-and-see approach. Market prices remained relatively stable, with only minor fluctuations. On Tuesday, the situation in Fujian and Zhejiang intensified, with war clouds gathering and Guangdong remaining on the sidelines. Market prices fell, with most bonds reaching new lows, dropping another one or two yuan. On Wednesday, the November futures settlement was processed with little market activity. On Thursday, rumors were rampant, with reports of fighting breaking out in Zhejiang and Fujian, and even rumors of a "Third Government" being established. Public anxiety was palpable. Major players sold off their holdings, causing various bonds to hit new lows across the board. The "Residual Troops" and the "First Customs" bonds even triggered a trading halt after falling over four yuan in the afternoon, marking the second major crash of the year. January futures were launched and immediately saw widespread short selling. On Friday, the market was extremely chaotic, with large swings that were difficult to predict. Only two trading sessions took place throughout the day. Guangdong advocated for the Fujian side to dissolve its new organization and seek alternative solutions to the current situation, further fueling public anxiety. Prices generally fell in the morning, but in the afternoon, southwest mediation efforts led to a strong rebound, with prices surging one or two yuan. As a result, prices ended up rising one or two yuan overall. On Saturday, prices initially continued to rise, but after the second session, news of disrupted telegram lines in Wenzhou and the submission of five conditions by the southwest caused prices to fall again. The market remained highly chaotic, but the outcome was relatively positive, with a slight rise of a few jiao. With the prospect of war looming, the future remains uncertain. As a result of last week's trading, prices fell by amounts ranging from one or two yuan to two or five yuan, with spot prices falling by as much as six yuan. The total transaction volume was 12,045,460 yuan. The weekly results, including highs, lows, and price changes, are summarized in the table below (unit: yuan, trading unit: 100 yuan):</p>

<p>Yesterday's American cotton market initially fell due to Southern hedging sales, but later rose due to buying by the penalty industry. As a result, spot prices fell by 5 points, and futures prices fell by 1 or 2 points. Liverpool cotton spot prices rose by 1 point, and futures prices fell by 3 to 6 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices rose by 4 points. The Bombay cotton market fell due to selling by a few retail Japanese merchants and profit-taking by bulls. As a result, Pinga'er fell by 3 rupees, Aumra fell by 2.5 rupees, and Bai Luoxi fell by 2 rupees and 1 jiao 2.5 fen. The original telegram records are as follows (December 2nd telegram):</p>

<p>Yesterday, the sources of goods in Southern Shanghai were similar. There were over 30 lots of late rice (5,000+ shi), and nearly 20 lots of thick japonica rice of various grades (4,000+ shi). After the late rice market situation had been able to stabilize slightly the day before yesterday, sellers immediately called for higher prices upon opening, and as the Qingdao and Yantai gangs were not affected by the weekend and began to sell, the market gained momentum. Unexpectedly, the Tianjin gang remained on the sidelines throughout the morning, failing to make purchases, which constrained the overall situation. The 4,000-5,000 bags of late rice that had already entered the market showed little profit or loss. The market situation for thick japonica rice and Duyang pointed rice was similar to the previous day, with only a slightly tighter appearance. All prices remained unchanged. Yinbian Yuan liquor dealers paid customs duties, resulting in sluggish sales, causing prices to fall by more than a foot.</p>

<h3 id="e252">On Change <a href="#e252" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c252" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">252</a></h3>
<p>— Qu Yi</p>
<p>The Book of Changes says: "Closing the door is called Kun, opening the door is called Qian; opening and closing, this is called change. Coming and going without end, this is called flowing." It also says: "When things reach their limit, they change; when they change, they flow." Therefore, what is called change is to seek flow. Hollowing out wood to make boats, shaping wood to make oars; boats and oars, these are changes in wood. The benefit of boats and oars is to cross the impassable, reaching far and benefiting the world. In ancient times, people lived in caves and in the wild; later sages "changed" this with palaces and houses; and today's modern men and women have places to dance their waltzes. In ancient times, people used knotted cords to govern; later generations "changed" this with written contracts, so officials could govern and the people could be examined; and today's literati can use these to wage ink-and-paper lawsuits. Change is transformation. Change and transformation are both used to seek flow. However, the change of the ancients necessarily sought to understand the emotions of heaven, earth, all things, yin, yang, cold, and heat. The change of today's people necessarily seeks to conform to the historical and natural laws. The words are different, but the meaning is the same.</p>
<p>There is a person who closes his door to read, steeping himself in the classics, never tiring. He always considers the noise outside the door to be vulgar and not to be approached. One day, the wind blows the door open, and he steps outside. He realizes that what his eyes see and his hands touch are worth more. He then understands that understanding human affairs is the essence of writing. He suddenly realizes what makes a person human, and unconsciously his hands dance and his feet step. And I, in my small-mindedness, scold him, saying: "You used to despise the noise, but now you dance in the midst of it. Your change is shameless!" This is also to see little and be surprised by much, like seeing a camel and calling it a horse with a swollen back, completely lacking understanding of the principle of change.</p>
<p>Zhuangzi said: "Seeds have different potentials. When they get water, they become 'ji'; when they get water and soil, they become frogspawn clothing; when they grow on mounds and dunes, they become lingxi." The specific things named are not important, but the meaning is very valuable. For things inevitably change their growth according to the suitability of the water and soil. From egg to larva to pupa to adult insect, this is the growth process of insects. Anyone with basic scientific knowledge knows this. Yet its changes can be said to be numerous. And I again, fixated on the larva and adult insect, scold it, saying: "You used to be an egg, but now you appear as a larva; you used to be a pupa, but now you appear as an adult insect." Wouldn't I be laughed at by the insects and their descendants?</p>
<p>Yet words are the voice of the heart. Where words reach, the heart stops. The Book of Songs says: "The green caterpillar has offspring, and the guo lu carries it away." Zheng Xuan's commentary says: "The pulu (guo lu) takes the offspring of the mulberry worm, carries them away, warms and nurtures them to make them its own offspring." Tao Hongjing's commentary on the Herbal Classic and Cheng Yaotian's "Small Record of Insects" both refute this, saying that the guo lu is a type of wasp that builds mud chambers on the eaves, lays its eggs inside, and catches green caterpillars (the so-called green caterpillar) to feed them. If the "offspring of the guo lu" are fed and grow, eventually transforming into guo lu, this natural change is not strange. Yet the poet must refer to them as the offspring of the green caterpillar. Yang Xiong's "Fa Yan" then adds to this, saying: "The offspring of the green caterpillar die, and when they encounter the guo lu, they pray: 'Be like me! Be like me!' After a long time, they resemble it." Then, those who do not believe that the "offspring of the guo lu" transform into guo lu, do they have the lingering regret of Yang Xiong? Saying that they are not like me.</p>
<p>I am moved by the fact that people today use "changeable" to scold people, and do not use historical and natural laws to measure how the change is. I write "On Change."</p>
<h3 id="e253">A Quiet Record of Fangyan <a href="#e253" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c253" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">253</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Dafu</p>
<p>Fangyan is located fifty li northeast of Yongkang County. From Jinhua to Yongkang is about a hundred li, and there are public buses available. However, from Yongkang to Fangyan, one must either take a sedan chair or walk. On the day we went, because the sky was overcast and threatening rain, we all took sedan chairs after getting off the public bus in Yongkang and proceeded east. After fifteen li, we passed Jinshan Village. Another fifteen li brought us to Zhiying, a large town with about a thousand households, mostly surnamed Ying. We stopped the sedan chairs for a brief rest. The rain grew heavier, so we bought some oiled paper and the like to serve as rain gear. After traveling another ten or so li, mountains began to rise on both sides. The peaks and rocks were peculiar, and old trees grew haphazardly. Viewed in the light rain, they took on various shapes. The sedan bearers pointed them out one by one, saying: "This is Grandma Rock, that is Tiger Rock... Rat Ladder," and so on, rattling off a long list. After a few more li, we arrived at Yanxia Street, already at the foot of Fangyan.</p>
<p>Anyone who has been to Jinhua should have this experience. After checking into a hotel, some country gentlemen in dark blue long gowns, refined and courteous, will come to question you: "Are you going to Fangyan to burn incense? How many times have you come to offer incense? Which inn have you stayed at before?" If you answer that it is your first time going to Fangyan, they will hand you a business card and ask you to stay at their inn when you go up to Fangyan. These are all "innkeepers" from Yanxia Street, serving as customer greeters who are like hotels but slightly different. Hundreds of li away, these agents are dispatched to solicit business, which shows both the popularity of the Fangyan incense market throughout the year and the fierce competition among the four or five hundred families in Yanxia Street.</p>
<p>The so-called "innkeepers" of Yanxia Street, who run the hotel business and rely entirely on the Hugong Temple for their livelihood, number three to five thousand in total. Most are surnamed Cheng or Ying, and their literary style is extremely prosperous, and their property is also considerable. The houses are all three-story buildings. Generally, the lower level is built in the valley, the middle level is along the street, and the upper level is a building. Each inn has thirty to fifty rooms, and during the peak incense season, it is said that every inn is overcrowded. Pilgrims come from Shaoxing, Chuzhou, Hangzhou, and nearby counties, and there are also those who come from as far away as Fujian.</p>
<p>From Yanxia Street, after another three or five li of winding roads, one ascends the mountain. The stone steps on the mountain are countless, dense and steep, winding and circling. It takes an hour to reach the Fengmen of the Hugong Temple.</p>
<p>Hugong's given name was Ze, his courtesy name was Zizheng. He was from Yongkang and served as the Vice Minister of War during the Song Dynasty. He often petitioned for the exemption of the Dingqian tax for the people of Quzhou, Muzhou, and Wuzhou. Therefore, the people were grateful and established a temple to worship him. Hugong studied at Fangyan when he was young, so the temple in Fangyan is considered the genuine and oldest one. Moreover, he often performed miracles. The most notable of these are the following:</p>
<p>During the reign of Emperor Huizong of the Song Dynasty, bandits invaded Yongkang. The villagers took refuge in Fangyan. Fangyan had a "Thousand People Pit" with large vines hanging down. When the bandits arrived, they climbed up the vines, but suddenly a red snake was seen biting through the vines, and all the bandits fell to their deaths.</p>
<p>Bandits arose in Qingxi and occupied Fangyan. The leader of the bandits dreamed one night that the god was watering his horse in the pool of the rock, and at dawn the pool was dry, and his followers were terrified and dispersed.</p>
<p>During the Taiping Rebellion, nearby villages were often looted, but Fangyan remained unscathed.</p>
<p>In the third year of the Republic of China, villagers from Sheng County, admiring the spiritual power of Hugong, built a temple to worship him. Under cover of darkness, they came to Fangyan to steal Hugong's head, intending to use it to make an idol. Hugong appeared in a dream to the leaders and farmers of nearby villages, instructing them to arrest the thieves who stole the idol's head. All the thieves were soon arrested. In the winter of that year, a large fire broke out in a village in Sheng County, and all those who had heard about the theft of Hugong's head lost their homes. The following August, two villagers from that village came to offer incense, and both died on the road.</p>
<p>Similar miracles and supernatural events are countless, so the incense fire at Fangyan burns continuously throughout the year, especially during the spring and autumn seasons. Pilgrims come to worship from all directions, hundreds of li away. The people of Jinhua who travel far from their hometowns build Hugong Temples in their respective locations to worship him. Although it is said to be superstition, the extensive influence of his transformation and power is truly beyond our expectations. This is a brief explanation of why Fangyan's reputation can spread far and wide. As for our reason for traveling thousands of miles to see Fangyan for ourselves, it lies in the mountain's secluded, spiritual beauty, which is completely different from other mountains.

<h3 id="e254">Fishing <a href="#e254" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c254" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">254</a></h3>
<p>— Sheng Huanming</p>
<p>The impressions left from childhood, those that are more clearly engraved in my mind, are mostly from the summer. The sweltering heat that makes one's whole body covered with prickly heat, the unbearable itching of poisonous mosquito bites that fill all ten fingernails with dirt, are not easily forgotten.</p>
<p>At night, everyone sits on the scorching stone steps or doorsteps to cool off. Mosquitoes hum incessantly, and the fire of the water pipe flickers on and off in the darkness. Far away, the summer evening breeze gently carries the scent of rice paddies and the creaking sound of the waterwheel. While others chat, I sit alone, scratching my red bumps, listening intently. The conversations are mostly about stories of the Taiping rebels "searching the mountains", "places to cultivate immortality", or the appearance of zombies, which make people both disgusted and afraid. The heat inside the house has not yet dissipated, and as soon as you cross the threshold, you can hear the buzzing of mosquitoes. Mosquitoes attack everywhere, whether it is your nose, ears, or mouth. If a child goes alone towards the lake, people will say:</p>
<p>"Ming Ge'er, do you see that? Under the willow tree, there's a water ghost with red hair!"</p>
<p>And I would be frightened back.</p>
<p>But summer nights don't always give me a sense of unease. As soon as someone says "Let's go fishing!", I would become excited.</p>
<p>However, fishing doesn't happen often. There are two obstacles: the lake outside the door rarely "divides the well" even in years with little rain (the elders say that there are some places with no bottom); the "seed fish" released into the lake at the beginning of the year would at most weigh only three or four jin by then. It would be a pity to catch them all, because there would be no big fish to net in the winter. This is not allowed.</p>
<p>But it doesn't mean that there is no fishing in the summer. It does happen: This usually takes place on moonlit nights. The sound of gongs rings out, and people with "pestles" (note) wade into the Bailing Lake in groups, catching fish noisily until past midnight.</p>
<p>During these rare fishing trips, the elders invariably express their dissatisfaction:</p>
<p>"Look at this 'world'! It 'must change!'" The squinting Uncle Gui grumbles: "It must change. Instead of taking the fish to the city to sell, they... In the old days, fishing was not allowed until winter. This world!"</p>
<p>"Damn old thing!" I mutter a fish head in my mouth, hiding behind the door, thinking: "When these old things die, then we can go fishing every day!"</p>
<p>Last summer, I returned to my hometown and met him by the lake. He had aged beyond recognition. He tapped his water pipe against an old willow tree, his lips trembling: "I'm old, useless, these things!" He rubbed his large, gnarled hands, roughened by labor, and stared blankly at the fishermen.</p>
<p>Whether on the lake's edge, on rafts, or in the shallow water, people cast their nets or use other fishing gear to catch fish, relying on their luck. The ripples of fishing in Bailing Lake collide with each other. The lake water has all turned a deathly color.</p>
<p>"In the old days - sigh, not even the Taiping rebels took as much as this. You intellectuals understand, is there anything in the books that says you can fish like this in the summer? - There isn't. It's changed!"</p>
<p>Soon, I understood: In the evening, or when the sun was about to set, I saw them carrying the fish they had caught in wooden basins or stringing them through their gills with willow branches and going to the city. When they returned, they brought back some necessities that even the poor couldn't do without. Bailing Lake was clearly their only source of emergency funds.</p>
<p>When I left my hometown, it was winter. It was clear that Bailing Lake had been fished out.</p>
<p>"We should pool some money to buy 'seed fish'!" someone said. Everyone was silent.</p>
<p>Note: "Pestle" is a local term. A type of bamboo-woven fishing tool, about three feet tall and circular. It is inserted into the bottom of the water, and if a fish is detected, a hand is reached down from above to catch it.</p>

<p>— Guy de Maupassant, translated by Li Weike</p>
<p>But suddenly, as if awakening from a dream, he saw them clearly; and because they seemed happy and content, he suddenly felt a resentment toward them.</p>
<p>Now, as he brushed past the groups of people, circling around them, he became absorbed in new thoughts. The multicolored decorations covering the beach like bouquets of flowers, the beautiful fabrics, the dazzling parasols, the unnatural coquetry of unfree bodies, the ingenious inventions of all the fashions, from the exquisite shoes to the strange hats, the seductive postures, voices, and smiles, in short, all the flamboyant displays on this beach, suddenly seemed to him like a field of blooming flowers of female vice. All these women, so elaborately adorned, wanted to please, seduce, and attract someone. They were for men, all men! Except for the husbands who no longer needed to be conquered — they were adorning themselves. They were adorning themselves for the lovers of today or tomorrow, for the strangers they might meet, notice, or anticipate.</p>
<p>And these men, sitting near them, looking into their eyes, talking to them with their lips so close, calling out to them, wanting to have them, though it seemed so near and easy, yet they chased them like hunting a nimble and cunning bird or beast. Therefore, this vast beach was nothing more than a market of love, where some women sold themselves, and others gave themselves away, where some women priced their caresses, and others offered themselves. All these women were thinking only of the same thing, presenting and making others envy their bodies, which had been given, sold, or promised to other men. And he thought that this was the same everywhere on the whole earth.</p>
<p>His mother had done the same thing as other women! Like other women — no! There were also exceptions, and many, many! Now, he was seeing wealthy, fervent, love-seeking women, who probably all belonged to that elegant and frivolous society, or even to the society of prostitution, because on this beach, trampled by idlers, one would not encounter the virtuous women who stayed deeply within their homes.</p>
<p>The tide rose, slowly driving the first rows of bathers back toward the city. The groups of people, seeing the yellow wave crested with a ring of foam surge up, hastily stood up, grabbing their chairs and fleeing. The small changing houses on wheels, drawn by a horse, also moved up; and the boardwalk, paved with planks and running along the beach from one end to the other, was now filled with people, black and slow-moving, some going east, some going west, shoulder to shoulder, heel to toe, mingling together. The hypersensitive Pierre, becoming agitated by brushing against them, fled them, running alone into the city, stopping at the door of a simple hotel, and going in for lunch.</p>
<p>After he had eaten and drunk his coffee, he lay back on two chairs outside the door, for he had not slept at all that night, and he dozed off under a banyan tree.</p>
<p>After resting for several hours, when he awoke, it was already time to hurry back to catch the boat. So, he took the road to the pier, troubled all the way by the fatigue that had quickly descended upon him during his nap. Now, he wanted to return, wanted to know if his mother had found Maraisa's portrait. Would she bring it up first, or would he have to ask again? If she was still waiting for someone else to ask, then she must have a secret reason for not wanting to show the portrait to anyone.</p>

<h3 id="e256">Love, Money Worship, and Hedonism <a href="#e256" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c256" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">256</a></h3>
<p>— Qiong Sheng</p>
<p>Now that the freedom of love in China has moved from discussion to widespread reality, few people pay attention. However, this does not mean that the "true meaning" of the freedom of love has been thoroughly understood and consistently practiced. The reason for the silence is that two extreme viewpoints are dominating people's hearts, failing to "grasp" the relationship between sex and love, and between material things and the spirit of both sexes. This has led to the current widespread phenomenon of romantic, carnal pleasure, and the common occurrence of civil lawsuits such as "seducing underage girls" and abandoning them without providing support.</p>
<p>Both of these phenomena are manifested against the backdrop of the current economic bankruptcy. To fundamentally solve this, it is natural to start by changing the current economic situation and the social structure that caused the economic bankruptcy. Without a correct understanding of the relationship between sex and love, spirit and material things, and without doing one's "best" within this understanding, it cannot be denied that the relationship between the sexes is becoming increasingly worse. The reason for not correctly understanding the relationship between sex and love, spirit and material things, is the pure money worship in the relationship between the sexes, and the simple mechanism that regards sexual desire as the basis of all relationships between the sexes.</p>
<p>Shortly after the "May Fourth" movement, which represented the national independence movement and democratic revolution, the terms freedom of love, freedom of divorce, and freedom of marriage were introduced. At that time, although China was also suffering from imperialist aggression, the social and economic bankruptcy was far less severe than it is now. Therefore, a group of intellectuals whose economic status was neither high nor low once advocated "sacred love." However, in recent years, China's economy has been greatly bankrupted under the influence of the global economic panic and the intensified plunder by various powers. The men and women of this group of declining small and medium-sized classes have turned to the money worship of love, and to the mechanism that takes sexual desire as the center and equates love with sexual desire. The former, in their conduct and experience, regards money as the greatest magic power, and disregards emotions, selling their bodies whole or in parts as soon as they see money. The latter takes sexual desire as everything, attempting to temporarily numb themselves to reality and engaging in romance at will. The former is obsessed with being the plaything of financial tycoons, wealthy wives, and young ladies, while the latter "lives for the day," hoping to forget their worries through pleasure. However, both are reflections of the decline of the middle class. Of course, a small number of people have their luck and become wives or relatives of officials, but most of them are discarded like worn-out shoes after several attempts. Even if they appear in court, they only add a few more appearance fees for the lawyers. There are even many who become wronged ghosts at the Huangpu River or the protagonists of suicides at the Hua'an Building. As for the advocates of pure sexual pleasure, regardless of temporary or short-term "carelessness," they not only cannot forget reality after intoxication, but also inevitably experience spiritual pain because people are emotional beings of flesh and blood. In the current economic bankruptcy, the emergence of love money worship is naturally a manifestation of the middle class surrendering to the enemy. Under the view of "you have money, I have beauty," the practice of selling the body is undoubtedly harmful to the correct development of the relationship between the sexes. However, the enjoyment of carnal pleasure is also far from a progressive consciousness. Celebrities quote materialistic views to defend it, believing that "love is sexual desire" is a materialistic understanding. The harm it causes is no less than surrendering to the enemy. In addition to the vulgar view of mechanically using materialism to prove and distinguish human relationships, it also directly promotes the harmful phenomenon of indulging in carnal pleasure and avoiding reality. We criticize love money worship. It is only natural that some people with weak will lose their bodies and minds under the temptation of money in the current environment where money can do anything, and there is nothing to discuss. The fundamental problem lies in the fact that money is concentrated in the hands of a few people, and the "freedom of love" is inevitably used as a morbid phenomenon of indulging in desire.</p>
<p>Therefore, while we do not agree with love money worship or the enjoyment of carnal pleasure, we should see them as economic and social phenomena. People with no resources who cannot afford to take their lovers to dance halls and movie theaters do not need to "mourn like bereaved parents" over their broken hearts. They should just think that they have seen the expensive "Southern ham" at Sincere Company and dare not ask about it, and they will feel relieved. Seeing the phenomenon of enjoying pleasure by going to hotels and dance halls, there is no need to lament that "the world is going downhill and people's hearts are not what they used to be," because it will also decline with the progress of the times.</p>
<p>Some people say that in this day and age, old women and young girls compete for extravagance and evil, and the freedom of love leads to promiscuity and chaos. In fact, these are all extreme views. The phenomenon of seeing money and opening their eyes, and not caring about selling their bodies, and the fact of being intoxicated in pleasure without knowing the affairs of the world, are inevitable in their occurrence and inevitable in their extinction. Moralists cannot do anything by concerning themselves with social customs and shouting loudly.</p>
<h3 id="e257">Secrets to Asking for Help <a href="#e257" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c257" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">257</a></h3>
<p>— You Yi</p>
<p>The other day I saw an article by Mr. (Shen Min) entitled "Notes on Visiting Friends," which referred to the methods that must be known when visiting important people: it was also very pleasant, but since it specifically referred to visiting important people, the word "friend" in visiting friends seemed to be not very appropriate, because important people naturally everyone wants to know them and be friends with them: However, they may not be willing to lightly recognize you as a friend. This word "friend" may not be established without the other party's permission; even if you knew him before he was promoted and made a fortune, and were very familiar with him, and he stubbornly cannot get rid of you, I guess his respectful title for you will at least be limited to work, and he will also add the word "poor" to the word "friend": He will say to everyone, "He is a poor friend from the past." Listen to that, this word "poor" is so embarrassing, it is better to cancel this title and be done with it: Therefore, I changed this topic to "Secrets to Asking for Help" and supplemented a few more sentences. Fortunately, in today's society, except for those who carry long guns and talk about hard fighting, and those who carry pistols and talk about hard robbery, no one can survive in the world without asking for help. Secrets to asking for help must be known. In my opinion, it is also very easy, nothing more than "boasting" and "flattering." First, start with the subject of conversation: If he likes prostitutes, talk to him about prostitution; if he likes gambling, talk to him about gambling; if he doesn't like to talk about this, and wants to study knowledge and value talents to gain fame and reputation, then you can pretend that you have returned from studying in the East and West, and that you have specialized knowledge, expertise, and superb skills, and flatter him as a great politician, great economist, and great educator. As long as you boast and flatter appropriately, or add some nighttime entertainment, you will definitely win the heart of the important person and get an official position.</p>

<p>To seek wealth and obtain wealth, to get whatever one wants, isn't that delightful? But there are also two things to avoid most when asking for help, which must also be known. The first point is, if the important person you are asking for help from used to be humble, and you once helped or promoted him, be sure not to bring up old things. You think you are expressing kindness and inspiring his conscience, but you don't know that important people value face most and are most afraid of exposing their past shortcomings. If you must speak out, he will be ashamed and angry at that time, turn his face, and will definitely repay kindness with hatred. The second point is, if the important person you are asking for help from puts on airs and gives you a big lecture, be sure not to be unable to bear it, you must be calm, smile, and sincerely accept the lesson. This is a good opportunity to show your flattery, don't miss it. Moreover, since you are asking for help, the fact is that you need him to be a tool for you to find a job, like a farmer needing an ox, or a rider needing a horse. If you think like this, you will definitely be calm and not get angry or talk about integrity.</p>
<h3 id="e259">Relying on Oneself <a href="#e259" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c259" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">259</a></h3>
<p>— Local</p>
<p>After returning from the printing press with the proofs, it was already past ten o'clock. Treading on the brick road under the hazy moonlight and dim starlight, the shadows of the trees flickered! The spirit in my mind was suddenly attacked by terrifying thoughts, transforming into a hideous ghost! The strings of my heart suddenly felt terrified! Trembling! I quickened my pace, hoping to leave the dark and terrifying world as soon as possible.</p>
<p>In the defeated yellow weeds, the small insects were emitting miserable wails! They were begging for help, they were asking for, begging for the aid of people, asking for the sympathy of people. The current late autumn, being crushed by the giant wheel of the times, is about to disappear. The cold and windy winter night will soon begin to wreak havoc. Little insects! How do you feel about the bone-piercing winter, how will you get through it?</p>
<p>Nature is giving them cruel coercion! How will they resist it? They are sad! They are afraid! Exhausting their strength, they sing a desperate lament! Ah, little insects! It is a mistake for you to beg for mercy from the people on this night road! Do you know? In this cold and biting autumn night, when the noble people, they have long closed their doors tightly, burrowed into their warm quilts, and are making their sweet dreams. Those who are not afraid of the cold wind and dew and are walking on the road! Like me! They are all like you! Little insects! Laborers who are suffering the same fate! I will tell you, their environment, their surroundings, are just as miserable and pitiful as yours. How can a single piece of clothing covering their bodies resist the violence of nature? How will they get through the cold winter? Therefore, they also deeply feel sad and afraid, but in order to cover up with a false mask of shame, they do not, like you, cry out in a voice hoarse with exhaustion?</p>
<p>Because of this, your begging for help should still be directed to the rich and noble gentlemen! But, the hearts of the gentlemen are all made of iron! They are not even willing to help the poor who are on the same line, the same kind, so where will they find the sympathy to sympathize with you! Therefore, in my opinion, your hope of asking them is slim, there is no possibility of realization, or like me, hold on to the principle of "relying on oneself"! Little insects, get up quickly, fight, seek your survival, if you still do not realize the truth until death, and still beg for help from others, and wail, then, in the end, the only thing you can do is to stretch your neck and submit to the execution!</p>
<p>Fifteen minutes later, I ran into the dormitory, lit the lights, and finally temporarily escaped from this dark world. But the current brightness is so false! The darkness of the past will be born again in an instant.</p>

<p>— Meng Yuan</p>
<p>In the evening, after eating dinner and chatting for a while, Bin, like a yuanbao, hugged his four-year-old son, Zigang, and said:</p>
<p>"Good boy! Good boy! Today you will go to sleep with grandma; there are delicious things on grandma's bedside; go ahead; grandma is waiting for you to eat!" Bin seemed to be murmuring a prayer.</p>
<p>But the child shouted, "I won't go, I want to stay with Mom tonight."</p>
<p>Bin frowned and looked at Ling with a bitter face.</p>
<p>"What to do? This child is so stubborn!"</p>
<p>His wife sat aside with a smiling face, watching Bin's anxious expression, and couldn't help but smile and glance at him. Bin patted Zigang's back and coaxed him, saying:</p>
<p>"Go ahead! Good boy! Grandma is calling you! You used to sleep with grandma for a few days, and grandma was very happy with you; if you don't go, grandma won't love you anymore!"</p>
<p>"A'nan, go ahead! Your dad is getting anxious!" Ling said in a teasing and understated tone.</p>
<p>"I won't go, I won't go, I want Mom..." The child was still making trouble, shouting, and his two small hands were slapping and hitting Bin's face.</p>
<p>"This little guy, he doesn't know what's good for him!" Bin was furious! He blamed the child and threw him onto the sofa, so the child started to cry loudly!</p>
<p>After letting go, he regretted being too reckless! Bin glanced at Ling's face, only to see her say with a cold face:</p>
<p>"Why don't you just throw him to his death? Then you'll be quiet: I know you don't need children!"</p>
<p>"What a joke, look how hateful this child is! I tried every possible way to coax and please him, but he still wants to make trouble like this?..."</p>
<p>"Hum! Coaxing and pleasing, you only care about your own happiness, and don't care about my child!"</p>
<p>"What a joke! Isn't he my child too?"</p>
<p>"Then why do you treat her like this?"</p>
<p>"Okay! I admit I was wrong...okay..."</p>
<p>Ling pouted and ignored him, ran to the sofa, and picked up Zigang:</p>
<p>"A'nan! Don't cry, listen to Mom, go to sleep with grandma today; tomorrow Mom will buy you a small toy gun to play with."</p>
<p>"I also want a small horse." The child laughed!</p>
<p>The matter of the day dissipated like smoke; the child was taken to grandma's foreign-style house by Bin as usual. When he came back, he saw his wife folding the quilt. She turned her face and said:</p>
<p>"Look at your own stubborn nature, and you still blame the child for being stubborn and making trouble: How come he was willing to go obediently as soon as I came?..." As she said, she pursed her lips and smiled. Bin also laughed.</p>

<p>— Yi Ping</p>
<p>Plato said: "Human society is a big stage." We only look at the smiling faces on the front stage every day, but we don't understand the various things behind the scenes. The comedy that artists perform on stage? It is the whole of life. If we uncover the background behind the scenes, there are material slaves and oppressed tears. Look, that clown, dressed in a painted face, runs out from behind the stage to be made fun of by the audience. He is always wearing a smile, or perhaps it is when his tears have not yet dried. We have seen Lang Que Nai's Langh Crown Langh and Emil Jannings' Blue Angel, so Chekhov told us: "Our compatriots are crawling out of various different holes."</p>
<p>Let me explain the back of the stage to you. The role of the clown is below all roles. He is hired to put on a painted face to reconcile the audience's mood before the main role appears. He shouts, dances, and tells various stories that can elicit a smile from people. If the audience laughs, he can win the favor of the troupe leader, so he is always wearing a smile. The fate of his parents, wife, and children is completely tied to his smiling face. Within the laughter, behind the smiling face, who knows that it is the crystallization of tears?</p>
<p>There was a famous clown in Europe. Because he wanted to study the art of clowning, he forgot the obligations he should fulfill to his wife, but his wife could not forgive him because she was also a clown who wanted to win the favor of the audience and the troupe leader. His life was to seek survival on a smiling face. Finally, while he was wearing a painted face and laughing, his wife left a letter and ran away; however, this poor clown, no matter how painful he was and how desperate he was to shed tears, he always wore a smiling face on the front stage. Do you want to see the tears of a clown? Please go to the backstage.</p>
<p>The sound of unemployment is filling our ears in China. Recently, the deaths of two clowns have uncovered the backstage. It turns out that they have a solid position in the scope of their profession. They jump and shout every day to win the favor of the audience and the troupe leader. However, one died without funeral expenses, and the other committed suicide due to the pressure of life. We see their smiling faces on the front stage every day, but the backstage is filled with tears behind the scenes?</p>
<p>"Human society is a big stage." The background of the clown has been revealed, but on this big stage, there are also our compatriots who are wearing smiling faces and want to win the favor of the audience and the troupe leader, but without success. Crawl out of various holes and come to this big stage to play a clown who is always wearing a smiling face.</p>

<p>— Meng Yuan</p>
<p>Cui was my wife Li's classmate, and they were also very good friends.</p>
<p>Before I talked about love with Li, I had a few love songs with Cui first; but in the end, my friendship with Cui faded! Then I became Li's only prisoner. So my process with Cui was an open secret in front of Li. Sometimes when I said that Cui had some shortcomings, my wife would often tease me in a playful tone, saying, "Your Cui is the best!" But Li's friendship with Cui still maintained a normal state.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, there was an exception! I praised Cui a few words unintentionally, which aroused "my wife's lesson." This was about half a month ago, and I wrote about it in this publication on the 28th of last month.</p>
<p>Now let's recall a past event; this was probably in the spring of this year:</p>
<p>My wife was feeling unwell and fell ill! After I sent her to the train station to return to her hometown to recuperate, it was quite lonely, especially on Sundays! Sometimes I could still bear it and sit at home alone to write manuscripts; but this loneliness could not leave my heart after all, and I was even more worried about my wife's illness, and I was even more depressed! So, the decadent mood could only be spent in places where money was spent.</p>
<p>Of course, it was also a very lonely and depressing Sunday afternoon when I accidentally ran into Cui and two of Cui's girlfriends at the Nanjing Grand Theater. The door of the ticket office was so crowded that Cui smiled at me and then frowned; so I volunteered to squeeze into the crowd and bought four tickets, and we sat down together.</p>
<p>Before the show started, Cui gently asked me:</p>
<p>"Why didn't Li come with you?"</p>
<p>"Because she is unwell, she went to the countryside last week to recuperate!"</p>
<p>"What? Li is sick! Why didn't we good sisters tell us?"</p>
<p>Afterwards, the intense and exciting action on the screen stopped our conversation; at the end of the show, everyone said goodbye and left!</p>
<p>After returning home, I planned to tell my wife about meeting Cui in a letter; but after a second thought, I thought it was unnecessary to do so! Maybe my wife would say to me, "You are always so concerned about Cui's affairs." So, I only told my wife that I watched a movie in Nanjing, but I didn't mention meeting Cui.</p>
<p>Four or five days later, my wife's reply came! It started by saying:</p>
<p>"Yuan:</p>
<p>Why do you always like not to let me know about some things? Haven't you and Cui's affairs been</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>Open to me? I deeply feel your pure and sincere love for me, and I also understand your frankness; but, Yuan, can you let me know everything about you? Isn't this your purest and most frank expression? But, Yuan! Why are you unwilling to tell me about some things? Yesterday I received a letter from Cui, she said: Thank you for inviting her to watch a movie, and also asked me if I was feeling well?..."</p>
<p>After I finished reading the letter, I felt ashamed and couldn't help but regret it: It wasn't that I regretted inviting Cui to watch a movie, it was that I blamed myself for being too mindful! Why didn't I tell my wife frankly? "I suffered myself by having a guilty conscience." Damn, damn! This time, my dear wife doesn't know how much trouble she will have?</p>
<p>That night, I spent two hours writing four pages of manuscripts, carefully explaining it to my wife in a tactful way, in order to seek her understanding.</p>
<p>Not many days later, my wife's letter came. I hurriedly took it out and finished reading it in one breath, so the matter was put down like a heavy stone of a thousand pounds, and things were much easier!</p>
<h3 id="e263">A Newspaper Reader in a Mansion <a href="#e263" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c263" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">263</a></h3>
<p>— Jian Ping</p>
<p>When the master opened his eyes every morning, he didn't even have time to eat white fungus before he hurriedly flipped through the daily business news: it is said that his whole day's joys and sorrows were completely tied to this moment.</p>
<p>Because the mistress didn't know many characters, she only looked at the advertisements of the three companies and the discount news of Xulun Datonghang.</p>
<p>The concubine was a famous movie fan and theater fan, so after her various daily tasks such as applying rouge and powder, drawing eyebrows, and manicuring her nails, she must carefully check the movie advertisements and stage advertisements to determine her whereabouts for the day.</p>
<p>The young master originally liked to look at the local news, and he was not willing to easily let go of any news about jealousy, rape, abduction, and escape, especially the dog races three times a week.</p>
<p>But recently, he has been paying attention to the classified advertisements for renting and transferring, and it is said that he is now eager to arrange a "golden house" to fulfill his long-cherished wish of "hiding a beauty"!</p>
<p>The young lady's habit of reading the newspaper was very similar to that of the mistress, but she also knew some movie advertisements and dance hall news.</p>
<p>Aguan usually only flipped through cartoons and illustrations, but since a group of imported circuses came, it aroused a lot of his interest.</p>
<p>As for the dry and tasteless party and government news and the irrelevant diplomatic policies, no one wanted to look at them at all. Even the things that our fellow journalists considered to be the crystallization of their brains only got a false title of "something" to hide away; if they were lucky, they might still be able to find a "fragment" on the pancake and fried dough stick stall in the future.</p>

<p>— Zhang Lao San</p>
<p>I escaped from the countryside, thinking that Shanghai could always accommodate me; but within two days, Shanghai gave me too much disappointment. Like my sister Min, that companion who sympathized with me, ran to the paradise of heaven. Uncle, just bring the things here faintly. My cousin, the urban girl, seems to be deeply in love with me. The courage that I barely mustered, from the countryside to Shanghai, from Shanghai to the hotel, from the foreign villa to the tram, has disappeared without a trace. Go back, I can never leave my younger brother, when this consciousness襲ed my heart, it is best to go back to my hometown in one step, but can I quietly go back? I am not afraid of the neighbors' ridicule, but am I willing to step into this cage again and be a hooked fish? At this time, my thoughts, just like this tram, are bound by the rails and run back and forth, running, running, where will they end up?</p>
<p>Brother, what am I talking about?</p>
<p>(18) At the Restaurant</p>
<p>I jumped off the tram arbitrarily on the way, looking at the dim street lights in the center of the street,整理ing my steps, one lamp, two lamps, countless lamps, it is the lively center of Shanghai again.</p>
<p>"Wine", a gold-lettered black-bottomed city sign, rippled in the light and jumped into my eyes, and my disturbed nerves seemed to need its stimulation, "Go get drunk," I couldn't help but step into the restaurant. After occupying a table near the road and the waiter送ing the wine, I only took a small sip,擎ed the wine glass, and kept looking at the road in front, but what can I see? The lively urban area of Shanghai, at this time, is like a vast desert where no one has been seen for hundreds of miles to me. Can this fragile heart overcome such an environment? There is no beautiful smile of the sun here, but the same human beings, but the eyes of different people, those eyes are as terrible as the electric torches on cars. My future, "Can I bring a younger brother who has no experience and no productivity?" Mount Tai-like questions拥涌ed in my heart, going back to protect my younger brother, or bringing him to the desert to discover clear springs?</p>
<p>The neon lights were shining opposite, the cars were roaring in the center of the road, and the sound of mixed and happy leather shoes came from the stairs behind. I estimated that it was a group of students who were amazing at spending money. I don't know what movie they watched and散场ed from a sensual dance. After gorging themselves, they are preparing to spend the steps of the sleepless night. For a while, it seemed that the active air of youth was filling the small restaurant, and the romantic life of my school days restored in my memory, "There is always an opportunity for you young people!" Sister Hui's catchphrase powerfully束ed my scattered thoughts,忘形地擎ed the cup and drank the cold wine in one gulp.</p>
